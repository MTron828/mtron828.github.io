Chapter 1729: Treasure Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

“Do you think you can escape in Xihuang?” Chao Shou sneered.

He flipped his palm and took out a purple ball.

This ball was flashing with light. It was the secret treasure Chao Shou had obtained by chance.

With this secret treasure, he could easily find Qin Yu’s location, so he was not flustered at all.

This was also the reason why he dared to let Qin Yu go upstairs alone.

However, Qin Yu had a different story to offer.

After Qin Yu walked out of Pilgrimage City, he performed line word formula and shot away. In the blink of an eye, he had traveled hundreds of stars!

After traveling hundreds of stars, Qin Yu wiped the sweat from his forehead and said in a low voice, “That was close. That person is probably from the Chao family.”

He sat on the ground and panted slightly, his eyes looking into the distance.

It was a desert ahead with no trace for ten thousand miles. It was seriously too difficult to find the other two cities.

“Da*n it, I can only look for it step by step,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

Thus, he strode forward and headed to the next city.

On the other side, Chao Shou took the secret treasure and planned to look for Qin Yu’s traces.

At this moment, someone suddenly walked to Chao Shou’s side, cupped his hands, and said, “Master, there’s someone from North Plain who wishes to see you.”

Chao Shou was startled, and then he said in a cold voice, “North Plain?”

A long time ago, North Plain and Xihuang formed an alliance with the goal of attacking Nanzhou together.

However, this matter had been shelved for a long time. Chao Shou was indeed rather surprised that North Plain had suddenly sent someone over.

He was silent for a moment before he said, “I know.”

After thinking about it, again and again, Chao Shou decided to leave Qin Yu alone for the time being.

In Chao Shou’s opinion, since Qin Yu had come to Xihuang to search for dark energy, he would not leave easily, so he was not in a hurry.

It was now inside the Chao family’s sect.

Yong Ji was sitting on a wooden rattan chair, waiting for Chao Shou’s return.

“Mr. Yong Ji, Yuan Xiu seems to have been resurrected, right? Didn’t you go to Nanzhou?” Chao Cang, who was standing at the side, asked. Yong Ji opened his mouth, not knowing how to reply.

If he were to reveal the news of Yuan Xiu’s defeat, the two brothers of the Chao family would definitely think to back out.

After thinking for a while, Yong Ji smiled. “It’s just a clone. He still needs some time to revive his main body.”

“Oh, really? Why did I hear that there was a huge battle between Nanzhou and North Plain?” Chao Cang half smiled and said.

Yong Ji’s expression changed. He knew that he couldn’t hide this matter anymore, so he could only nod and say, “Indeed, one of the master’s clones went to Nanzhou to fight with Xiao Sheng.”

Chao Cang was silent, waiting for Yong Ji to continue.

“The Lord’s clone severely injured Xiao Sheng, and he’s currently unconscious,” Yong Ji continued.

“Oh? Does that mean that Yuan Xiu has lost?” Chao Cang said indifferently.

Chao Cang’s straightforwardness left Yong Ji at a loss.

Obviously, Chao Cang didn’t fall for his trap at all. “It’s the clone who lost, but even so, he almost killed Xiao Sheng,” Yong Ji said in a deep voice.

Chao Cang opened his mouth and was about to speak when Chao Shou returned.

He walked to Yong Ji’s side and said coldly, “Let’s get straight to the point.”

Yong Ji cupped his hands at Chao Shou and said, “You’re sect master Chao Shou, right? I’m here on the master’s orders to report the battle.”

Chao Shou was silent, waiting for Yong Ji to continue.

Yong Ji had learned his lesson. He didn’t hide what had happened and explained it in detail.

Not only that, but he also sincerely said, “To be honest, it will still take some time for the master to be resurrected, so he can’t go to Nanzhou. However, if the master is completely resurrected, I’m afraid that Xiao Sheng will be able to step into Return To Void Stage.”

“At that time, it won’t be that easy to get rid of Xiao Sheng. I think you know how terrifying he will be by then.”

“Hmph, do you think we’re afraid of him?” Chao Cang said in an extremely displeased manner.

Chao Shou waved his hand and interrupted Chao Cang.

“Truth be told, I’m not afraid of Xiao Sheng at all even if he has reached Return To Void Stage,” he said to Yuan Xiu. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Yong Ji couldn’t help but sneer in his heart.

“Not afraid? If you’re not afraid, why are you hiding here in Xihuang? Are you acting tough?” he thought.

Even though he thought this, Yong Ji still smiled and said, “I know how powerful you are, but we don’t need to take the risk.”

“I know you don’t believe me, but I have this secret treasure in my hands. I’m indeed not afraid of him,” Chao Shou said indifferently.

With that, Chao Shou flipped his palm and took out the purple pearl.

Looking at the pearl, Yong Ji frowned and said, “What is this?”

“Dharma Treasure,” Chao Shou said indifferently.

“With this in hand, I am not afraid of anyone in the entire Lizhou, including Thunder Courtyard.”

Yong Ji furrowed his brows tightly, his face filled with suspicion.

Chao Shou was not in a hurry. With a thought, he immediately activated the pearl.

In an instant, the sky changed color, and the earth cracked. A terrifying aura burst out from the pearl, and an aura no weaker than Holy Power crushed over!

In just an instant, Yong Ji was smacked to the ground by this aura. Blood flowed out of his body and many of his bones were shattered!

Fortunately, Chao Shou had put away this item in time. Otherwise, Yong Ji would have died on the spot!

“What… what is this?” Yong Ji didn’t care about the injuries on his body and quickly stood up.

“I’ve already said that it’s a secret treasure. Do you still doubt my words?” Chao Shou said indifferently. Yong Ji’s expression immediately darkened. The terror of this item had far exceeded his imagination!

He had no doubt that the aura just now could have killed him in an instant!

“But… I’m still willing to help,” at this moment, Chao Shou suddenly changed the topic and said with a faint smile.

When Yong Ji heard this, he was overjoyed. He quickly cupped his hands and said, “Many thanks, Sect Master Chao!”

“But I have a condition,” Chao Shou said with a faint smile.

“Sect Master Chao, please do tell!” Yong Ji hurriedly said.

“I heard that Yuan Xiu has obtained part of the inheritance of Immortal Slaying Sect. I have some understanding of what kind of sect Immortal Slaying Sect is and I’m also very interested in it,” Chao Shou said indifferently.

“After this is done, I want the inheritance that Yuan Xiu has obtained. If you agree, I will head to Nanzhou three days later and kill Xiao Sheng.”

Yong Ji’s brows furrowed.

In the entire North Plain, only Yuan Xiu knew about Immortal Slaying Sect’s inheritance. They valued it greatly.

However, if he did not get rid of Xiao Sheng now, he might not have another chance in the future, and might even lose his life.

“Yes! I’ve agreed on behalf of my master. As long as you kill Xiao Sheng, everything can be negotiated!” Yong Ji immediately said.

“Can you make the decision?” Chao Cang asked.

“Who would say no now that you got such a treasure? If the master doesn’t agree, you can use this item to kill him!” Yong Ji laughed.

The two brothers looked at each other and seemed to think that it made sense.

“Alright, I’ll take Xiao Sheng’s head in three days.” Chao Shou nodded immediately.
