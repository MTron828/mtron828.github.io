1779 Let Him Come

The two of them looked at Xiao Sheng and said indifferently, “Our young master’s things were snatched in Nanzhou by a person called Qin Yu.”

At this point, they paused, stared at Xiao Sheng, and said, “As the number one person in Nanzhou, you seem to have injured our young master, did you?”

Xiao Sheng’s expression turned even colder as he said, “Go straight to the point.”

“Alright!” One of them stood up.

He clasped his hands behind his back and said indifferently, “Our young master values talented people. Since you don’t know our young master’s identity, we can spare you. However, you have to find the things that our young master lost and hand over the person who snatched them to us.”

When Xiao Sheng heard this, he couldn’t help but sneer.

“Snatch? When has Qin Yu ever snatched your young master’s things?” Xiao Sheng said coldly.

“What? Don’t tell me he can own the things that he has his eyes on?”

The two of them seemed to have anticipated Xiao Sheng’s response, so they were not anxious.

“Xiao Sheng, logically speaking, you shouldn’t have escaped from this calamity. Our young master is giving you a chance now. Don’t lose something hard to get,” they said coldly.

Xiao Sheng’s expression turned completely cold now.

“I’ll give you one minute to get lost from here,” Xiao Sheng said coldly.

The two men squinted their eyes and said in a threatening tone, “Xiao Sheng, once we leave Tianyun Sect, you won’t have another chance.”

“If you don’t leave now, you also won’t have the chance again.” An ice-cold chill emanated from Xiao Sheng’s body.

The two of them knew that Xiao Sheng was not easy to deal with. Furthermore, their goal was not to attack Xiao Sheng. Thus they did not deal with him.

“if that’s the case, we won’t bother you any longer,” the two of them said coldly.

After saying this, they turned around and left.

When they reached the door, one of them suddenly stopped.

“By the way, I forgot to remind you that our young master’s name is Tong Guangqing. If you’re interested, you can go and ask around.”

After saying this, they strode away.

Xiao Sheng’s expression was incomparably cold. He had not expected this group of people to have come so soon.

As for the Tong family, Xiao Sheng did not know much about them. He only knew that they were a rather powerful aristocratic family in Zhongzhou.

“Sect Master, this… What should we do now?” The Deputy Sect Master frowned.

Xiao Sheng glanced at him and said coldly, “There’s nothing to worry about. I’ll just wait for them to come.”

…

Qin Yu had no idea about this at all. He slept in the cave abode for three days before he gradually woke up.

As soon as he woke up, Qin Yu smelled the aroma of meat.

Following the smell, he saw Jue Wu crazily gnaw on a roasted leg.

Seeing Qin Yu wake up, she waved to her and said, ” “Quick, come and try this! It’s so d*mn delicious!”

After sleeping for a few days, Qin Yu was indeed a little hungry. He walked to Jue Wu’s side and muttered, “Where did you get this?”

Jue Wu pointed to the nearby forest and said, “D*mn it! You don’t know how many wild animals are in there!”

Qin Yu glanced at the forest.

It made sense. In a place with such rich spiritual energy, there must be a lot of wild beasts.

After having a satisfying meal, Jue Wu got up and said, “Let’s go and get a mission. I heard that a mission is out today.”

“So fast?” Qin Yu said in surprise.

“That’s right. It seems that we have better luck,” Jue Wu grinned and said.

She jumped up and sat on Qin Yu’s shoulder.

After that, the two of them walked toward the cave abode where they could accept missions.

When they arrived at the cave abode, it was already full of people.

Qin Yu glanced at them and noticed many of them had reached the Reversion Void stage.

“Qin Yu, you guys are here too.”

Soon, a young man came forward to greet them.

The young man was quite handsome. Qin Yu could not help but think of Zhuo Jing.

Qin Yu nodded at him as a greeting.

“I’m Bai Xuesong. You can call me Xiaobai,” the young man introduced himself and said.

“I saw you pass the test a few days ago,” Xiaobai said. “To be honest, I really admire you.”

Qin Yu was a little embarrassed by his words.

After some idle chit-chat, the two of them became more familiar with each other.

Xiaobai pointed at the mission in front and said, “The missions this time are all from East Continent. Thus everyone is more enthusiastic. If you want to take it, I’ll go with you. In your current state, I’m afraid it’s too dangerous to go out.”

“Thank you for your kindness. I don’t think it’s necessary. I’m not used to being with other people,” Qin Yu shook his head and said.

What Qin Yu wanted to do was to devour other people’s primordial spirits, which could not be made known to outsiders.

Seeing this, Xiaobai could only nod and say, “Alright then. You take good care.”

“Alright,” Qin Yu nodded and said.

After that, Qin Yu and Jue Wu came to the grotto-heaven of the place.

When they arrived at the grotto-heaven, they realized that there was only one mission left. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

The target of this mission was called Ji Si, a Reversion Void stage cultivator. There was detailed information about him on the scroll.

“How is it? Is there a problem?” Qin Yu raised his head and looked at Jue Wu.

“Of course, there’s no problem!” Jue Wu said. “I’ll kill him with one hand!”

“Alright.” Therefore, Qin Yu immediately accepted the mission.

After receiving the mission, Qin Yu and Jue Wu walked out of the cave abode.

As soon as they walked out, they saw many Devil Hunters standing there chatting.

They looked at Qin Yu from time to time. No one knew what they were discussing.

At this juncture, Xiaobai walked over. He patted Qin Yu’s shoulder and said, “You should know that this is a place where the strong rules. The weak will not be valued here.

“Your performance a few days ago has given you a life-saving token. However, this life-saving token has a time limit. Take good care of yourself.”

Qin Yu nodded slightly, not having any emotions in his heart.

Thunder Courtyard had nine main peaks. Those who were willing to come to Demon-slaying Peak were all fierce and competitive people. How could they look up to the weak? Especially a person whose foundation was thought to be damaged?

Moreover, Qin Yu’s previous impressive battle achievements did not match his current strength. Thus he would definitely attract attention.

“Don’t worry, I’m here. I’ll beat whoever dares to cause trouble to death!” Jue Wu waved her little fists and said.

Qin Yu smiled and rubbed Jue Wu’s head with a little affection.

This action instantly caused Jue Wu’ to feel dissatisfied. She glared at him and said, “You little b*stard! You have no respect for your elders!”

In terms of age, Qin Yu couldn’t even be considered a grandson to Jue Wu.

Qin Yu couldn’t help but laugh. He then looked at Xiaobai and asked casually, “Xiaobai, when can we get a mission to Zhongzhou?”
