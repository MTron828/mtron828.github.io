Chapter 837: I’m Even More Terrifying!

“Forget it, I don’t want that so-called quota anymore,” Qin Yu said coldly.

However, Wan Guqiong didn’t give up.

He grabbed Qin Yu’s arm and said, “Brother Qin, I promise you that the Wan family will never do anything to Miss Yan. We will only borrow a little of her blood.”

“I said, no.” Qin Yu shook off Wan Guqiong and turned to leave.

At this moment, Wan Guqiong’s expression turned cold.

“Qin Yu, I have always been very polite to you, but you don’t take the Wan family seriously,” Wan Guqiong said coldly.

Qin Yu looked at Wan Guqiong and said, “I won’t let anyone hurt Yan Ruoxue.”

At this moment, Wan Guqiong showed his true colors.

He looked at Qin Yu coldly and said, “Qin Yu, let me tell you, you can’t protect Yan Ruoxue by yourself! In the future, not only the Wan family will eye her, but countless other families will also appear!”

Qin Yu’s expression also became colder and colder.

“Then let’s give it a try,” Qin Yu said coldly.

After saying this, Qin Yu turned around and prepared to leave.

At this time, Wan Guqiong shouted from behind, “Qin Yu, the Wan family will definitely take Yan Ruoxue! If you are sensible, then take the initiative to hand her over. The Wan family will still remember your favor!”

Qin Yu’s footsteps immediately stopped.

He couldn’t help but feel that it was somewhat funny.

Back when Yan Ruoxue was imprisoned in the Jingdu Martial Arts Association, these so-called martial arts aristocratic families didn’t even dare to do anything.

No one had ever dared to target Yan Ruoxue. They had evil intentions, but they didn’t have the guts to do so.

But ever since Qin Yu brought Yan Ruoxue out, these people seemed to have gone crazy, desperately trying to get Yan Ruoxue.

It was simply laughable.

Wasn’t it obvious that they bullied the weak and feared the strong?

Qin Yu turned around and looked at the Wan Guqiong, and couldn’t help but sigh slightly.

“You... You think I’m easy to bully, right?” Qin Yu shook his head.

Wan Guqiong frowned slightly and said, “What do you mean?”

Qin Yu said in a deep voice, “You think that compared to the Jingdu Martial Arts Association, I’m easy to bully, right?”

“You don’t dare to provoke the Jingdu Martial Arts Association, but you dare to provoke me, right?”

Wan Guqiong’s expression froze, and then he laughed loudly. “What nonsense are you talking about! Qin Yu, did I not make myself clear just now? Yan Ruoxue, I...”

“Bang!”

Wan Guqiong hadn’t finished speaking when a fist smashed his mouth!

This punch came too suddenly, and even Wan Guqiong didn’t have time to react.

His entire body was sent flying, and he spat out a molar in his mouth!

The sudden change immediately attracted the attention of countless people.

Everyone looked over in unison, their eyes filled with shock.

“Wan Guqiong, was I too respectful to you?” Qin Yu said coldly.

Wan Guqiong got up from the ground. He wiped the corner of his mouth and said angrily, “Qin Yu, you dare to beat me?!”

Qin Yu said coldly, “So what if I beat you?”

As he spoke, Qin Yu walked toward Wan Guqiong step by step.

The overbearing aura from his body made people not dare to approach him. Everyone unconsciously made way for him.

“Mr. Qin, what are you doing?” At this moment, Yao Meng hurriedly walked over and blocked Qin Yu.

Qin Yu looked at Yao Meng coldly and said, “You are Ruoxue’s friend, yet you helped a person like Wan Guqiong to scheme against her!”

Yao Meng frowned and said, “What do you mean?”

“Stop pretending. I don’t believe that you don’t know that Wan Guqiong is coveting Yan Ruoxue’s bloodline,” Qin Yu said coldly.

Wan Guqiong, who wasn’t far away, shouted, “Qin Yu! Didn’t you want to participate in the exchange meeting? Let me tell you, with me here, you can’t go to this exchange meeting!”

“At the same time, I will also tell you that there will definitely be ten-thousand-year-old herbs in this exchange meeting, and not just one!”

“But you will never have the chance!”

“The moment your Martial Saint’s power disappears, it will be the moment you die!” Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and said, “Before that, I will kill you first!”

After he finished speaking, Qin Yu strode towards the Wan Guqiong!

Yao Meng tried to stop him, but Qin Yu’s terrifying gaze made her stop in her tracks.

“Brother Qin, please give me some face!”

At this moment, Zhuang Teng walked over quickly.

Qin Yu said coldly, “What, are you going to protect him too?”

Zhuang Teng shook his head and said, “Brother Qin, you’ve misunderstood. Let’s talk in private.”

He brought Qin Yu to the side and said in a low voice, “Brother Qin, I’m not helping him. It’s just that today’s occasion isn’t suitable to make a move.”

Zhuang Teng pointed to the crowd and said, “Among these people, besides martial artists, there are also the rich second generation of Jingdu and thedescendants of government official. If you fight here, who can protect you?”

Qin Yu frowned slightly.

What Zhuang Teng said seemed to make sense.

If he accidentally hurt someone else, it would probably be a troublesome matter today.

“Brother Qin, no matter what grudges you have, We’ll talk about it later.” Zhuang Teng patted Qin Yu’s shoulder.

Qin Yu took a deep breath. He forcefully suppressed the anger inside and said, “Okay, I promise you.”

Although he said so, Qin Yu still walked in the direction of the Wan Guqiong.

“Brother Qin, you...” Zhuang Teng opened his mouth, not knowing what to do for a moment.

Qin Yu smiled and said, “Don’t worry, I just want to say a few words to him.”

Then, Qin Yu strode in front of Wan Guqiong.

He looked coldly at Wan Guqiong and said, “Wan Guqiong, let me tell you something. The Jingdu Martial Arts Association isn’t to be trifled with, and I am not to be trifled with either.”

“I will use my actions to tell you that offending me is even more terrifying than offending the Jingdu Martial Arts Association.”

Qin Yu’s cold eyes stared at Wan Guqiong.

Wan Guqiong only felt a chill on his back. For a moment, he was actually frightened by this gaze!

By the time he recovered his senses, Qin Yu had already walked far away.

Wan Guqiong wiped the sweat from his forehead and gritted his teeth. “I must think of a way to kill him!”

At this moment, Wan Guqiong felt fear!

This kind of uneasiness made Wan Guqiong extremely fearful.

He even felt that if Qin Yu didn’t die, he would definitely bring disaster to the Wan family in the future!

“I have to think of a way... to kill him...” Wan Guqiong thought to himself.

His eyes rolled, as if he had thought of a countermeasure.

“Brother Wan, how are you? Are you hurt?” Someone walked over and asked fawningly.

Wan Guqiong shook his head. He looked at Zhuang Teng and said, “I have something to do, so I’ll take my leave first.”

After saying this, Wan Guqiong left quickly.
