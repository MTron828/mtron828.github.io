Chapter 2432 - 2432: Telepathic Finger

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

That terrifying speed was something that even many people of the same cultivation realm could not capture.

Lei Li became serious.

In an instant, he had already changed his position by up to ten thousand times. Suddenly, he saw a location.

He stopped there.

Finger Spear!

His finger moved tremendously slowly. His hand was like a snake as he pointed at Qin Yu.

The people outside looked at it and felt very strange. At this moment, Lei Li’s finger seemed to be moving in slow motion.

Telepathic Finger!

This finger was pointing directly at the soul.

Qin Yu stood on the spot without moving.

The speed of the Finger Spear was tremendously slow, but it slowly poked his forehead like an elder educating a child.

A drop of blood appeared around the Finger Spear.

“Why didn’t Qin Yu dodge? He seems to be frozen, and his body doesn’t resist.” The peak master clenched his fists tightly and could not help but ask.

“This is Martial Uncle Lei Li’s Telepathic Finger. The previous techniques were all used to break through force and were direct. But this finger contains Martial Uncle Lei Li’s comprehension. He turned himself into the Path of Heaven of Thunder. When facing the heavenly might, even the strongest person would be afraid. It’s an unavoidable mark in the depths of the spirit. Martial Uncle Lei Li once used this finger to kill a ghost race of Tribulation Fourth Level.”

Lei Xin had already placed one hand on the Immortal Emperor’s Thunder Staff, but Lei Huan walked to his side expressionlessly.

At this moment, the world had already disappeared in Qin Yu’s eyes.

In the entire universe, Lei Li’s finger was the only one that could not be dodged.

He was as if facing the stars and the moon. He had the ultimate power of tribulation and a suitable technique.

The power of this finger had reached its limit, and it had even vaguely reached the power of the Tribulation Fourth Level.

Qin Yu understood that if he could not break this move, he would definitely die on the spot today.

In Lei Li’s Finger Spear, an indifferent and emotionless golden eye suddenly opened.

Lei Li’s finger split into two, then four.

And it unfolded again. The Telepathic Finger in the world of the desolate divine eye displayed the most original composition of lines.

Soul Spirit Bead suddenly lit up in his sea of consciousness, and his entire body seemed to have turned into a golden sun.

The power of his soul turned into a golden holy sword and slashed at the connecting point of the finger technique.

The universe was destroyed, and heaven and earth returned to Qin Yu’s sea of consciousness.

Qin Yu’s head suddenly tilted. The finger pierced halfway into his head and was unable to go in any further.

Lei Li’s fist was grabbed by Qin Yu, making his finger unable to function.

“Boom!”

The power of the Sumeru World had been restored, and the Five Emperors in the Sumeru ring opened their eyes at the same time.

The Five Emperors supported the Sumeru World with their ten hands. Vast power surged into the Sumeru World again and then Qin Yu’s body.

It turned from defense to offense, in an instant.

Qin Yu’s fist struck Lei Li’s abdomen, and the power exploded, emitting starlights that filled the sky.

The terrifying force sent him flying, and his body crashed into Demon-slaying Peak ten thousand meters away. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Demon-slaying Peak let out a loud bang and collapsed under everyone’s shocked gazes.

Lei Li’s body sank deep into the mountain. He fainted, and no one knew if he was dead or alive.

Amid the mess, many people from Thunder Courtyard stared at the scene in a daze as if they could not believe what they saw. Demon-slaying Peak, which had stood in Thunder Courtyard for tens of thousands of years, collapsed.

Qin Yu stood in the air with blood all over his body. Blood dripped onto the ground drop by drop.

He stared at the Lei family’s ancestors like a demon god, without the slightest fear.

When fighting against Lei Li, he could only fight head-on. He had to gather the most power in each attack to meet it head-on. There was no way to avoid it.

Although he had broken the last Telepathic Finger, that terrifying power had also entered his body and caused damage.

The activation of the second level of the desolate divine eye had also consumed a vast amount of spiritual energy. He now only had one-third of his strength left.

“How is it? Sissy? I’ve beaten up two people. Do you dare to come up and fight me one-on-one now?”

Qin Yu looked at Hua Zhikong like a demon.

“B*stard, how dare you humiliate me like this!”

No matter how shameless he was, he really did not know how to face so many people from Thunder Courtyard in the future.

“What about I use only one of my hands? Or I can seal my physical strength. If it doesn’t work, I’ll let your little fists fight,” Qin Yu said helplessly.

“Pfft! Pfft! Pfft!”

Hua Zhikong’s mouth spurted out blood like a showerhead.

“Hahaha, Qin Yu, you’re so bad.”

Chang Mang laughed heartily. In any case, they had already shed all pretense of cordiality.

At most, he would die, and he could accept it.

“Great! Great! My entire family has worked hard for Thunder Courtyard, and today, I’m humiliated by an outsider. This is my ancestor’s punishment for me. If I, Hua Qianjie, have done anything wrong, my ancestor will show his divinity and tell me directly!”

Hua Qianjie cried out mournfully.

“Shut the f*ck up! The old b*stard gave birth to a little b*stard. Thunder Courtyard was destroyed because of you!”

Qin Yu cursed and pointed at Hua Qianjie.

Qin Yu was severely injured but not afraid at all.

“Little b*stard, my Thunder Courtyard has done you a great favor. Is this how you repay the Thunder Courtyard?”

The flesh on Hua Qianjie’s face kept trembling. She was tremendously angry.

“The ones who have done me a great favor are Dean Lei, Flower Granny, and the people from Thunder Courtyard. What does it have to do with you people?”

“Are you done with your glib tongue? No matter how sharp-tongued you are, you will be buried here tonight.”

Lei Huan’s expression was complicated. He also felt a little regretful.

Today’s matter was indeed due to some complicated thoughts of theirs, causing two geniuses to be buried.

And after this, Thunder Courtyard would definitely become a laughing stock.

However, since the matter had already become a reality, he had to fight for enough benefits to offset this loss.

“Kill Qin Yu and control Yan Ruoxue. Use her blood essence to nurture the higher-ups of the Lei family.”

In the blink of an eye, the divine sense circulated in the sea of consciousness of the people. In an instant, they had reached a consensus. At this time, they could no longer withdraw the fist that they had thrown out.

“Attack! You hypocrites will only tarnish the reputation of Immortal Emperor Lei!”

Qin Yu was too lazy to argue.

Amidst the massive explosion, Lei Huan was too lazy to waste his breath. Previously, he was unwilling to make a move because of his status.

But now, even Lei Li had been defeated by Qin Yu, so he could no longer stay out of it.

“How terrifying! I can already feel the suffocating pressure even before he makes a move. This guy is much stronger than Lei Li. He might even have reached Condensed Throne Fourth Level.”

Jiang He looked tremendously solemn.

He Teng did not say anything further. If it was Lei Li, he still felt Qin Yu might still have a chance.

But facing this person, even He Teng felt the fear of death.

The higher the level of the battle, the simpler it was.

Techniques were more about coordination. Most of it boiled down to brute force against brute force.

The Path of Heaven of Thunder was originally the way of utmost resilience. If complicated techniques were added on, it would instead reduce its strength. Of course, it did not include Telepathic Finger, a technique compatible with the rules of thunder and lightning..
