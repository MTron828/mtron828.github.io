2278 The Rampage of Dao Techniques

“Every injustice has its perpetrator and every debt its debtor. I don’t believe you can’t feel the shattered soul of the masked woman of nine lifetimes. If you check on this girl using your divine sense, you will know she is just an ordinary person. What right do you have to decide her fate?”

Qin Yu did not give in at all. There were too many unfair things in the world.

Xiao Yu was Ruoxue’s friend and also his friend. Now that the masked woman’s internal qi on her body was completely gone, he would protect her life no matter what.

Mei Li stepped forward and raised her palm slightly. The spiritual energy fluctuations vaguely appeared on her body.

“What he said is right. Even if there’s only a one in ten thousand chance, this woman must die. The era when the masked woman appeared was full of bloodshed.”

The golden light slowly appeared on Qin Yu’s body. His body began to turn bronze and shine with golden light. He had quietly circulated his body technique to the extreme. Facing this mysterious woman, he dared not be negligent.

A massive river of blood broke through the air. Mei Li stood on that river, her hair dancing in the wind.

The river of blood river gradually spread under their ground and slowly rose.

Soon, the viscous river of blood submerged Qin Yu’s ankles, knees, waist, and chest.

A terrifying bloodthirsty killing intent as violent as the sea crazily invaded his divine sense. Moreover, a massive hand in the blood river grabbed Qin Yu tightly to stop him from leaving.

Qin Yu was a little shocked. He had seen Mei Li soaking in the bone cultivation water previously. She was actually using the bone cultivation water to comprehend the Way of Blood River.

Her hands suddenly retracted, and an indescribable pressure wrapped around Qin Yu’s entire body.

“What a terrifying body. Even the ape’s body at seventh-level is probably inferior to yours.”

Mei Li frowned. She raised her delicate jade high up and clenched it fiercely.

A sense of danger instantly enveloped Qin Yu’s heart.

“Spiritualization Technique!”

Qin Yu’s terrifying power of divine sense instantly solidified. A massive black ball enveloped him, withstanding this enormous pressure.

She raised her hands high up in the air, and in an instant, her two fingers formed a seal in the air.

As she waved her hands, waves of spatial fluctuations slowly rippled around her hands.

It was like her hands dancing slowly in a lake, causing ripples to form and spread across the water’s surface.

As the water currents began to frolic, those fluctuations grew immensely.

As the mark on her hand concluded, a mark appeared in the middle of her forehead.

“Shadow of Blood.”

After that, a viscous shadow resembling blood suddenly shot out from the mark, plunging into the river of blood.

Qin Yu suddenly felt an extreme sense of danger. The blood river seemed to have its own consciousness in an instant.

In Qin Yu’s divine sense, the blood river before him was no longer a dead object at this moment.

It was a river with its own divine sense. Suddenly, the blood river spiraled up and circled around Qin Yu an unknown number of times before it began to shrink like a python.

An incomparably terrifying pressure crushed the sphere formed by Qin Yu’s Spiritualization Technique and shattered the golden light on his body layer by layer.

What a terrifying woman!

Qin Yu was tremendously shocked. No one knew about Mei Li’s background, but her strength was simply terrifying.

Qin Yu held Xiao Yu with her right hand, and the chaotic qi in his body surged into Suo Lin Divine Artifact in his left hand.

“Roar!”

A ferocious roar came out from Qin Yu’s glove. A giant unicorn came out from the inner core of the unicorn in the middle of Suo Lin Divine Artifact, and its massive bloody mouth bit the blood river.

Qin Yu fiercely punched the ground.

Nine giant fire dragons spiraled and crashed into the blood river, forcefully squeezing out a space from the blood river.

Taking advantage of this gap, Qin Yu quickly put Xiao Yu into the Sumeru Space.

“Elder Guai, take care of Xiao Yu.”

Qin Yu hurriedly left this message and returned to the battlefield where he was fighting with Mei Li.

At this moment, the nine fire dragons had been completely crushed by the blood river.

However, the unicorn pierced through the blood river with its soul-hunting power and slammed into Mei Li’s body, causing her to spit a mouthful of blood.

“As expected, that mark has consumed an immense amount of her soul power!”

Taking advantage of the moment the blood river surged, the chaotic power in Qin Yu’s entire body exploded.

The Fist of Annihilation struck out frantically. In an instant, hundreds of the Fist of Annihilation ruthlessly struck the blood river.

More than half of the chaotic qi was instantly consumed, and the blood river also could not withstand this terrifying power. After surging crazily, it suddenly exploded.

Qin Yu stomped on the remaining spiritual energy and did not continue to attack when he saw Mei Li vomiting blood.

The two of them did not harbor a deep-seated hatred, to begin with, but merely had differing perspectives. He was also unwilling to resort to total extermination.

He was also a little afraid. It was hard to say who would win if this mysterious woman was at her peak.

All of a sudden, the entire space shook violently.

Almost in an instant, this place began to shatter. Without the protection of the ancient Path of Heaven, the space here could no longer be stabilized by the terrifying aftershocks of the battle.

Qin Yu waved his hands and sucked the coffin into his Sumeru ring.

“Outrageous!.” Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Uncle Ling was about to attack but then quickly put down his hands.

“What outrageous? If you don’t take the treasure, heaven and earth will destroy you.”

Qin Yu said unhappily.

At this moment, the few strongest people could no longer attack. Sitting cross-legged on the ground, Xi Menn seemed to be comprehending the dao technique. He did not seem to have any intention of attacking.

All of a sudden, the dao technique shattered, and countless ways of rules appeared before everyone with a tremendously clear fluctuation.

Was this the dao technique of the woman of nine lifetimes?

Uncle Ling’s expression changed drastically, and he suddenly revealed a look of ecstasy.

The previous eight lifetimes of the woman of the nine lifetimes were all of Great Success. Under the current Path of Heaven, she could still suppress the evil exterminator. One could imagine how terrifying her dao technique was.

And now, before the space collapsed, her dao technique was once again displayed in front of everyone. This was simply a tremendously rare opportunity.

And the evil exterminator’s four different dao techniques were intertwined within.

This Mystic Realm seemed to have a strange spatial ability. The dao technique would constantly be deduced within just like an image in the mirror.

Mei Li also sat down cross-legged. The display of the twelve dao techniques was comparable to any top-notch supreme treasure.

Apart from the three who fainted, the remaining people sat cross-legged in tacit understanding. Before the space collapsed, they crazily comprehended the rare dao technique.

The dao techniques of various rules continued to wreak havoc in space, exploding. From time to time, tremendous destructive rules would pass by them. If they were not careful, they would be reduced to ashes. However, everyone did not care at all, crazily absorbing and comprehending this rare opportunity to peek at the Dao.

Perhaps even thousands of years of arduous cultivation might not amount to what could be achieved in just a few minutes here. Countless cultivators were stuck at the fourth-grade True Saint.

Even during the endless years of exile in purgatory, the number of people who could comprehend the rules of the dao techniques and break through the fifth-grade realm was close to a hundred at most.
