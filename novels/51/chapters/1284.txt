Chapter 1285: Chapter 1,285, negotiation with the Tianyun sect 

The team leader wasn’t flustered by Ling Yun’s threat.

He smiled and said, “I believe that the Tianyun sect will not go to war with my hunter organization.”

Ling Yun’s expression became colder and colder. He, who was arrogant by nature, had never been defeated before.

Just as he was about to flare up, the person beside him pulled him back.

“Young master, it’s better not to shed all pretense of cordiality with the hunter organization,”the attendant said softly.

“That’s right. The scope of the hunter organization’s goods is too wide. The Tianyun sect will definitely not make up their mind to eliminate them,”another person said.

Ling Yun took a deep breath and said with a dark expression, “The enmity between Qin Yu and My Tianyun sect can not be interceded by anyone. My Tianyun sect will definitely not let this go.”

After saying that, Ling Yun waved his hand and led his men out.

“Take care, Young Master Ling,”the team leader said with a smile.

The team leader’s face only darkened after Ling Yun had walked far away. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

He walked quickly to Qin Yu and said coldly, “You actually offended the Tianyun sect?”

Qin Yu smiled bitterly. “That’s right, team leader. I’m really sorry...”

The group leader said in a deep voice, “The Heavenly Cloud sect is powerful. Why did you provoke them?”

“It’s a long story.”Qin Yu sighed.

He wanted to tell the group leader what happened, but the group leader waved his hand, he said, “Forget it. The principle of the hunter organization is never to give up on anyone. Since you joined the hunter organization, I can only think of a way to protect you.”

At this point, the team leader looked at Jing Bai and said in a deep voice, “Jing Bai, Go and talk to them. If possible, our hunter organization is willing to pay a certain price. It can be a heavenly treasure or money.”

Jing Bai hurriedly nodded. “I understand. I’ll go and talk to them now.”

On the other side, Ling Yun was sitting with the three almighty experts.

Their expressions were extremely cold, and Ling Yun’s eyes were filled with murderous intent.

“A mere hunter organization wants to stop my Tianyun sect? I’ll return to Tianyun sect now to retrieve the Holy Weapon,”Ling Yun said coldly.

“Young Master Ling, you mustn’t.”The people beside him stopped him again.

“We mustn’t go to war with the hunter organization. We can’t even shed all pretense of cordiality.”

Ling Yun glared at the few of them and said, “Are we going to let him off just like that?”

“We can wait for him in the Green Rock Forest. As long as Qin Yu dares to go hunting, we can wait for an opportunity to get rid of him.”

“That’s right. When that time comes, no one will be able to blame us.”

Ling Yun was extremely unhappy.

He recalled the attitude of the team leader just now and couldn’t help but get angry.

“A mere team leader of a hunter organization Dares to challenge my Tianyun sect like this...”a trace of viciousness flashed across Ling Yun’s eyes.

At this moment, Jing Bai suddenly walked over from not far away.

When they saw Jing Bai, their faces instantly turned cold.

“Greetings, Young Master Ling.”Jing Bai walked forward and bowed slightly.

Ling Yun asked coldly, “What are you doing here?”

Jing Bai smiled. “I’m here under the orders of our team leader to apologize to you. I hope that Young Master Ling can forgive us for our offense.”

Hearing this, Ling Yun couldn’t help but sneer. “Apologize? Then what about your sincerity? Are you relying on your mouth?”

Jing Bai hurriedly waved his hand. “Of course not. Our team leader said that if you have any requests, feel free to mention them. As long as we can do it, we will not decline.”

Ling Yun laughed out loud. “Requests? You guys think too highly of yourselves! Do you know who I am? I represent the Heavenly Cloud Sect!”

“What can a mere hunter organization like yours bring to Our Heavenly Cloud Sect?”

Looking at Ling Yun’s arrogant attitude, Jing Bai was not surprised.

He continued, “The heavenly cloud sect has many disciples. I believe that they also need a large number of weapons, materials, herbs, and so on. This happens to be the strength of our hunter organization.”

“If Young Master Ling agrees, our hunter organization is willing to give up a portion of our benefits to the Tianyun sect.”

Hearing this, Ling Yun’s smile became even colder.

In the next second, he suddenly shot in front of Jing Bai. He extended his palm and grabbed Jing Bai’s neck, lifting him into the air.

The huge force made Jing Bai’s expression turn pale.

“Go back and tell your team leader that I Only Want Qin Yu. There’s no need to talk about anything else,”Ling Yun said coldly.

After saying that, Ling Yun threw Jing Bai to the side.

Jing Bai’s body slid on the ground for a few meters before he stabilized himself. He stood up and patted the dust off his body. “Young Master Ling, are you really not going to consider it?”

“Do you want to die? I Don’t mind sending you on your way ahead of time,”Ling Yun said coldly.

Since he had said so, Jing Bai didn’t say anything else.

He nodded slightly and left.

After returning to the hunter organization, Jing Bai told the team leader what Ling Yun had said.

After the team leader heard it, his expression became even more solemn.

“This Ling Yun is a ruthless person. The possibility of negotiating with him isn’t high,”Jing Bai said from the side.

The team leader took a deep breath and said coldly, “Then let’s delay it. I don’t believe that they will go to war with our Hunter Organization.”

“Moreover, there’s still the white bone club.”

The team leader looked at the white bone club in his hand and instantly felt confident.

Qin Yu stood at the side and couldn’t help but feel a little guilty.

“Team leader, I’m really sorry for bringing so much trouble to you.”Qin Yu sighed.

The team leader glanced at Qin Yu and said, “I’m not just doing this for you, but also for the Hunter Organization.”

“This is the rule of the hunter organization. I’m doing it more to protect the rules.”

Even though that was the case, the gratitude in Qin Yu’s heart was still indescribable.

“I’ll deal with this matter as soon as possible,”Qin Yu said in a deep voice.

There would be a fight with Ling Yun sooner or later. However, Qin Yu was currently heavily injured and couldn’t make a move for the time being.

Qin Yu made up his mind to fight with Ling Yun after his injuries recovered.

All the hunters were a little worried, but what touched Qin Yu was that none of them blamed Qin Yu.

There was no other reason. Many of them were the same as Qin Yu. They were here to escape, so they knew Qin Yu’s situation very well.
