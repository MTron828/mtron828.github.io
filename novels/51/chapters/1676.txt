Chapter 1677: Chapter 1,677, gouging out its eyeballs Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Qin Yu took a deep breath. Since it was divine dragon power, there must be some connection between it and this divine dragon.

Just as Qin Yu was about to activate divine dragon power, his expression changed slightly. He suddenly thought of something.

“That’s not right.”Qin Yu frowned.

Since this place was called the Dragon Burial Cave, who knew how many Divine Dragons had fallen.

If Qin Yu activated the Divine Dragon Power, wouldn’t he also die in this dragon burial cave?

Thinking of this, Qin Yu couldn’t help but break out in cold sweat.

Fortunately, he didn’t activate the Divine Dragon Power. Otherwise, he would have become a corpse just like this dragon corpse!

Unable to activate the Divine Dragon Power, Qin Yu suddenly didn’t know what to do.

He walked around the Divine Dragon. Looking at the Divine Dragon that was like a small mountain, Qin Yu’s head began to hurt.

“HMM? This divine dragon’s entire body is covered in scales, so I can’t break it open. But there is one place that is exposed.”Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and looked up at the huge head.

That was its eyeball!

This eyeball was extremely huge. If it could be dug out, it could be used for a long time.

Thinking of this, Qin Yu immediately jumped up. He directly took out the bronze sword and stabbed it towards the divine dragon’s eyeball.

“Puchi!”

As expected!

The eyeball was instantly pierced through and spat out a mouthful of blood!

Seeing this, Qin Yu was instantly ecstatic!

As long as he removed the eyeball, this trip would not have been in vain!

Although it was a little disgusting to pull out the eyeball, for the sake of cultivation, he could not care too much.

“I don’t know how many years this divine dragon has been dead, but his blood is actually preserved so well.”Qin Yu couldn’t help but feel amazed. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Under the long passage of time, nothing could be preserved. No matter how powerful he was, he would eventually turn into a pile of dirt.

But it couldn’t be denied that the stronger he was, the higher his realm was, and the stronger his ability to resist the passage of time would be.

Qin Yu no longer thought about it. He immediately began to dig out the divine dragon’s eyeball.

This was a huge project. It would not be so easy to dig out the eyeball.

Qin Yu took out a jar from the spatial magic artifact to prevent the loss of the blood.

One had to know that any trace of the Dragon Corpse’s blood was enough to create an expert! It must not be wasted!

After spending several days, only a little bit of the Dragon God’s eyeball was dug out, while Qin Yu was so tired that he was panting.

Damn, at this rate, I’m afraid it will take a long time to dig out this eyeball, Qin Yu thought to himself.

However, he didn’t dare to waste time. Zhuo Jing was still waiting outside. If he waited for a long time, no one knew what Zhuo Jing would do.

Therefore, he immediately got up and continued to dig.

...

Near the entrance of the dragon burial cave.

Zhuo Jing frowned, and his heart was even more anxious.

From time to time, he would look into the depths of the dragon burial cave, and his face was full of worry.

“He hasn’t come out yet...”Zhuo Jing murmured in a low voice.

Qin Yu had been in there for several days, but there was no movement at all. This couldn’t help but make people worried.

“Did something really happen to him?”Zhuo Jing took a deep breath, his expression becoming more and more serious.

After thinking about it, he finally got up and decided to go deep into the dragon burial cave to try to find Qin Yu.

Thus, Zhuo Jing carefully walked into the depths of the dragon burial cave.

Soon, he arrived at the border.

“Qin Yu said that as long as I Close My Eyes, I won’t activate that Black Shadow,”Zhuo Jing thought to himself.

Therefore, he closed his eyes and carefully walked deeper into the cave.

Unfortunately, Zhuo Jing was not Qin Yu. He did not have Qin Yu’s powerful body. Soon, he was blocked by the powerful corpse qi and could not take another step forward.

No matter how hard Zhuo Jing tried, the spiritual power in his body was still completely suppressed and he could not move.

With no other choice, Zhuo Jing could only turn back and return to the entrance of the dragon burial cave.

Standing at the entrance, Zhuo Jing’s expression became increasingly grave.

“Qin Yu... I’m afraid he has already died.”Zhuo Jing let out a long sigh, his heart filled with an indescribable sadness.

“No, I have to find someone to save him.”Zhuo Jing gritted his teeth and lifted his feet to walk out of the dragon burial cave.

But not long after he walked out of the dragon burial cave, that insect-like thing pounced out.

Not long after, Zhuo Jing escaped again.

“Damn it!”

Even Zhuo Jing, who had a very good temper, could not help but swear.

At this moment, he was really in a dilemma.

He could not go deep, nor could he go out.

“Am I going to be trapped here and die?”Zhuo Jing could not help but curse in his heart.

He could not help but look into the depths of the cave and sighed. “In this kind of place, I’m afraid I can’t even cultivate... Brother Qin, you go first. It Won’t be long before I go to find you...”

...

On the dragon’s head.

Qin Yu was sweating profusely as he kept locking the eyeballs of the dragon corpse.

This was a bloody and comical scene. The huge eyeballs were like a small house. In front of Qin Yu, he was like an ant.

He did not know how long it took, but the eyeballs were finally dug out.

The blood that flowed out had already filled several jars.

“No, I don’t have any more strength.”Qin Yu fell from the sky, smashing a big hole.

Under the influence of the corpse qi, Qin Yu also couldn’t display 100% of his ability. After several days of fatigue, the spiritual power in his body also began to run out.

Qin Yu lay on the ground for a while, his eyes staring straight at the eyeball that was about to fall.

“You might as well try to consume the dragon blood first.”

At this moment, the voice of Heavenly Blood Rainbow came from the spatial magic artifact.

Qin Yu was startled, then said with some excitement, “Yeah, why didn’t I think of that?”

This dragon blood was also a holy item for cultivation. Any drop of blood might be able to greatly increase Qin Yu’s cultivation!

Thinking of this, Qin Yu hurriedly got up and grabbed the jar containing the dragon blood.

“What are you doing?”

At that moment, the voice of the Heavenly Blood Rainbow sounded from the spatial magic artifact once again.

Qin Yu said, “Of course I’m drinking this dragon’s blood.”

“Heh heh, with your realm, if you were to swallow this jar of Dragon’s blood, I’m afraid you would instantly turn into ashes. That powerful strength isn’t something you can withstand,”said the heavenly blood rainbow coldly.

Qin Yu frowned slightly.

This was the truth. A drop of a saint’s blood could cause a mighty realm cultivator’s body to explode and die, much less this dragon blood.

Qin Yu was silent for a moment before asking, “Then what should we do?”

“Normally, you need to dilute this blood before you can withstand it. However, this dragon corpse has been dead for too many years. The blood is no longer as powerful as it was back then. You can try taking a drop, but whether or not you will die will depend on fate,”said Heavenly Blood Rainbow.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “Okay, thank you.”

After saying that, he raised his finger and picked up a drop of dragon blood from the jar and slowly put it into his mouth.
