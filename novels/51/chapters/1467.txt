“What is this Yongji trying to do?”Qu Zhu could not help but feel a little displeased.

“Who knows? Could it be that the northern lands have already contacted Yongji?”Jue Wu guessed.

At this moment, Qin Yu, who already had a bad impression of Yongji, felt even more disgusted.

In the face of everyone’s discussion.., yongji smiled and said, “Everyone, don’t be anxious. This time, Dragon Bridge is here for peace talks. The southern region and the northern lands have already been in conflict for many years. If this continues, the ones who will suffer will forever be ordinary people. If we can get a chance for peace talks, won’t that be good for everyone?”

Once these words were said, Jue Wu below could not help but curse, “I just hate this face of his. Just looking at him makes people feel disgusted.”

Qin Yu also felt that this Yongji was extremely hypocritical, making people feel disgusted.

Although that was the case, after Yongji’s explanation, the scene was obviously much quieter.

Long Qiao took a step forward, cupped his hands and said, “Just as Mr. Yongji said, I came here this time just to talk peace.”

“Talk Your Ass. How many people in the northern region have killed in the southern region? Do you want to Talk Peace Now?”Someone at the scene cursed loudly.

Long Qiao was not angry. He smiled and said, “This problem will be solved sooner or later. If it is not solved, more people will die.”

“Moreover, many people have died in our northern land.”

Yong Ji looked at Long Qiao and said with a smile, “Since it is a negotiation, let’s talk about our conditions. Today, all the famous people in the southern region are here. They can make the decision.”

Long Qiao glanced at the crowd and said indifferently, “We only need to build a thirty-star land at the border and allow us to survive. In return, I will give you the secret technique of the north, the Sacred Heart Formula.”

“What? The Sacred Heart Formula? The north is actually willing to take out the Sacred Heart Formula?”

“Rumor has it that this is a cultivation method created by the seniors of the north under extremely difficult conditions!”

“If we can obtain the sacred heart formula, our cultivation will be twice the result with half the effort!”

Countless people at the scene began to be moved. They seemed to be extremely moved by the Sacred Heart Formula.

Qin Yu looked at Jue Wu and asked in a low voice, “What is this Sacred Heart Formula?”

Jue Wu said in a deep voice, “I don’t know exactly what it is. I only know that it is a unique unique skill of the northern lands.”

“But I always feel that it’s a trap,”said Qu Zhu.

Not only Qu Zhu, but Qin Yu and Jue Wu also felt the same.

If they were just trying to survive, they definitely wouldn’t offer such conditions.

Moreover, not long ago, Qin Yu had personally witnessed Xiao Hai capturing the northerners.

The two cultivators from the northern lands not only wanted to occupy Qin Yu’s divine eagle, but also claimed that they had joined forces with the western ridge to attack the Southern Region!

This was completely inconsistent with what Dragon Bridge said.

Yongji smiled and said, “The living conditions in the northern lands are difficult. I’m sure everyone is clear about that. What’s the harm in giving up 30 stars? What’s the harm in treating it as a good deed?”

“He’s already said all the good things.”Jue Wu snorted lightly.

Qu Zhu also nodded slightly and said, “I’ve heard a rumor that the northern lands cultivates sorcery. They will devour people’s divine sense to cultivate. If they really give up 30 stars, who knows what will happen?”

“That’s right, that’s right. If they really want to survive, it’s understandable to give them thirty stars. However, the people of the northern lands have committed many evil deeds and are notorious. Who knows how many people have been harmed. Once they are allowed to enter the realm, it will definitely be a disaster,”Jue Wu also said.

Qin Yu didn’t really understand these things. He just instinctively didn’t like Yongji and this dragon bridge.

“How about this? Everyone raise your hands to vote, how about it?”Yongji said.

“Those who agree to this decision, raise your hands now.” Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Before he finished speaking, countless people raised their hands at the scene.

To put it bluntly, these people were the top people of the southern province. Even if the northern land really wanted to massacre the southern province, it wouldn’t affect them.

As long as they agreed, they would be able to obtain the Sacred Heart technique that was in their hearts and minds.

Looking at so many people raising their hands, Yong Ji smiled and said, “How about this, let’s put it another way. Those who disagree raise their hands, how about it?”

“I don’t agree!”Jue Wu raised her hand without thinking.

Qin Yu naturally agreed with Jue Wu, and so did qu Zhu.

Other than the three of them, there were only a few people who raised their hands. There were less than ten people in total.

Seeing this scene, a smile appeared on Long Qiao’s face.

He said with a faint smile, “Only the few of you don’t agree. In this way, this proposal can basically be passed.”

“Bullsh * T!”Jue Wu cursed.

Long Qiao was not angry. He smiled and said, “You are the famous Jue Wu, right? Although you are powerful, you can’t go against everyone’s wishes. Isn’t that too overbearing?”

Qin Yu could not help but sneer and said, “The population of the South Province is at least billions. Who Can they represent? Why should they represent everyone?”

Hearing this, Long Qiao frowned slightly and a trace of displeasure flashed across his face.

“I agree with Brother Qin Yu’s words,”qu Zhu said with a smile.

“You can’t ask everyone’s opinion, right?”Long Qiao continued.

“That’s right. What’s the use of just a few of you not agreeing?”At this moment, Zhong Wu suddenly opened his mouth.

He sized up Qin Yu and said with a strange tone, “Qin Yu, speaking of which, you don’t have the right to participate in this banquet at all. What right do you have to speak?”

Qin Yu looked coldly at Zhong wu and said, “F * ck you. If I don’t have the right, you don’t even have the F * cking right!”

“Who are you scolding!”Zhong Wu flew into a rage.

“I’m scolding you. What do you think? If you’re not convinced, just go out and fight!”Qin Yu was filled with fighting spirit, as if he wanted to make a move.

Zhong wu sneered and said, “Do you think I’m afraid of You?”

The great battle was about to start. Jue Wu also quickly stood up, obviously standing on Qin Yu’s side.

“Everyone values harmony. We can talk about anything.”At this time, Yong Ji stepped forward and said.

Zhong Wu looked coldly at Qin Yu and said, “Kid, you will die in my hands sooner or later.”

“I’ll exchange the same words with you,”Qin Yu said coldly.

Zhong Wu didn’t say anything more and sat down.

At this moment, the first elder also opened his mouth and said, “Yong Ji, you just saved Qin Yu’s life a few days ago. Today, he rebutted you at the banquet. This kid is really ungrateful.”

“Old Bastard, shut up!”Qin Yu scolded.

The first elder looked at Qin Yu coldly and said, “At such a young age, you already have enemies on all sides. Kid, it’s easy to bring trouble to yourself like this.”

Qin Yu mocked, “Is that so? Have you forgotten the time when you hid in the heavenly cloud sect a few days ago and didn’t even dare to Fart?”

The first elder’s face darkened. Although he was angry, he didn’t flare up. He just snorted coldly.

“Everyone, try not to change the topic,”Yong Ji said.

“According to the rules, we should make the final decision according to the number of people. This has always been the rule of the South Province.”

“If that’s the case, then I don’t think we should follow this rule.”

At this moment, a voice came from not far away.
