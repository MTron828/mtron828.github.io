2012 Forging the Saint Weapon

Their purpose for their visit here was quite similar to Qin Yu. They also wanted to find a magical artifact that could hide internal qi.

As long as the internal qi was concealed, they would not have to worry about taking the treasures away from the Chaos Grave.

It was also due o this reason that the price of magical artifacts that could conceal internal qi had soared recently.

Qin Yu ignored the elegantly dressed young man. He cautiously brought the lady boss to the side and said in a low voice, “Lady Boss, who should I look for if I want to forge a Saint Weapon in Divine Fortuity City? ”

Upon hearing what Qin Yu said, the lady boss said in surprise, “The conditions for forging a Saint Weapon are very harsh. Are you sure you want to forge one? ”

“I’m just asking casually,” Qin Yu quickly corrected what he had said.

The lady boss obviously had guessed Qin Yu’s thoughts. She smiled and said, “I can only tell you one thing. The power of a Saint Weapon comes from the Holy Power. Otherwise, it would be in name only.”

After saying this, the lady boss walked to the side.

Qin Yu thought for a while and soon understood what the lady boss meant.

In her opinion, Qin Yu did not understand the true significance of the Saint Weapon.

She naturally did not expect Qin Yu to have plenty of Saint’s bones in his hands, which contained the Holy Power.

Therefore, Qin Yu walked to the lady boss’s side again and said, “So no one in Divine Fortuity City can forge it?”

“Go to the middle section of Heavenly Star Street and find someone called Mr. Gen. He might be able to help you,” the lady boss said casually.

“Thank you very much,” Qin Yu bowed slightly and said.

After saying this, Qin Yu paid her another three million spirit coins and turned to leave.

After Qin Yu left, the elegantly dressed young man sized Qin Yu up and asked casually, “This kid is also here to ask for a magical artifact?”

“I can’t simply say. Otherwise, how can I continue to do business?” the lady boss smiled and said.

The elegantly dressed young man snorted slightly and asked for the price.

His expression instantly turned somewhat ugly when he found out the magical artifact cost 10 billion spirit coins.

“It’s so expensive now…” The elegantly dressed young man gritted his teeth.

The lady boss said half-jokingly, “Looking at how you dressed up, you don’t look like you’re short of 10 billion, do you?”

When the elegantly dressed young man heard this, he immediately snorted coldly and said, “Of course, I don’t lack this little money. It’s just that I need a lot of magical artifacts.”

The lady boss smiled and said nothing but snorted coldly in her heart.

“You guys catch up to that kid just now and see if he has any treasures on him.” The elegantly young man seemed to have thought of something and immediately ordered the two elderly men beside him to go after Qin Yu.

“Yes, Young Master.”

The two elderly men bowed and quickly walked out.

On the other end, Qin Yu followed the direction the lady boss had pointed out and arrived at the middle section of Heavenly Star Street.

A small shop with the signage “Rootless” was by the side. It was probably Mr. Gen that the lady boss had mentioned.

Qin Yu thus pushed open the door and walked into the shop.

After entering, he realized the shop was very small and did not display any magical artifacts. It was extremely simple and crude.

However, there seemed to be a courtyard in the depths of the shop. A magical artifact had sealed off that courtyard, and outsiders could not enter.

“Who is Mr. Gen, please?” Qin Yu cleared his throat and shouted.

After about two to three minutes, a dragging sound sounded from inside.

Then he saw a sloppy man slowly walking out.

He held a wine pot in his hand, and his beard almost covered his entire face.

This person did not look old, but he was too sloppy, causing him to look like he had been through many vicissitudes.

Mr. Gen gulped down a mouthful of wine and leaned back on the recliner.

“Is there anything?” Mr. Gen said drunkenly.

Qin Yu couldn’t help but feel suspicious.

Did such a person really have the ability to forge Saint Weapon? Was he more powerful than those people from Divine Artifact City?

“I would like you to forge a Saint Weapon for me.” Since he was already here, Qin Yu expressed the purpose of his visit.

“Do you think the Saint Weapon is cheap stuff on the street?” Mr. Gen sneered. “Do you know what it takes to forge a Saint Weapon?”

” Yes, I do. I’ve prepared all the materials. As long as you can forge a Saint Weapon, you can make it,” Qin Yu said.

Only then did Mr. Gen look at Qin Yu and stretch his back. “Alright, I want three holy bones as payment.”

“Alright.” Qin Yu agreed without even thinking.

Seeing this, Mr. Gen couldn’t help but sneer. “You’re quite arrogant. Alright. If you can give me the materials and three holy bones, I’ll accede to your request.”

Qin Yu did not say anything and immediately took out eight holy bones and ores that had not been sold.

“It should be enough,” Qin Yu said.

Mr. Gen sniffed and suddenly sat up from the rocking chair. Then he grabbed the holy bones in front of Qin Yu and examined them carefully.

“It’s indeed holy bone.” Mr. Gen frowned.

He raised his head to look at Qin Yu opposite him and said, “Where did you get this?”

“This has nothing to do with you, right?” Qin Yu said.

Mr. Gen didn’t ask further. He put the three holy bones on the table into his bag and said, “To make a decent Saint Weapon, you need at least eight holy bones. Give me three more, and I’ll forge it for you.”

“Alright.” Qin Yu took out another eight without saying anything else.

...

“Since I’m already forging one, let’s forge a better Saint Weapon,” Qin Yu said.

Mr. Gen rubbed his eyes and frowned. “Where did you get so many holy bones? Could it be that you came from an aristocratic family?”

Before Qin Yu could answer, Mr. Gen denied it and said, “It’s impossible. If you really came from an aristocratic family, why would you look for me?”

“Can you forge or not?” Qin Yu frowned.

Mr. Gen picked up the holy bones on the table and said, “I can’t guarantee that. I can only try.”

“What do you mean?” Qin Yu was a little unhappy. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

This Mr. Gen looked too unreliable. It was as if he was fooling people.

Mr. Gen glanced at Qin Yu and said, “Why are you in such a hurry? If you want to forge a Saint Weapon, you must first revive this holy bone and obtain the Holy Power within it. Without Holy Power, the Saint Weapon naturally can’t be forged.

“At the same time, to create Holy Power, you’ll need a lot of materials to be the inducer. As for what kind of materials are needed, it depends on the situation. Do you think it’s that simple?”

Qin Yu was silent for a while before he said, “Alright, how long will it take?”

“Come back three days later.” Mr. Gen kept the bones and lay down again.

...

“Please speed it up. I’m in a hurry,” Qin Yu reminded.

Mr. Gen waved his hand casually and ignored Qin Yu after that.
