Chapter 1557: Chapter 1,557, facing off against the white bone club 1 

Zhong Wu’s face revealed a smug smile.

He looked at the pained Qin Yu in front of him, and his smile became even crazier.

“Zhong Wu, you despicable man!”Guan Zhuang was instantly enraged and charged straight at Zhong Wu!

However, Zhong Wu had the white bone club, so how could guan Zhuang compare to him.

With a slight shake of his club, Guan Zhuang was directly pushed back!

“Are you guys worthy to fight with me?”Zhong Wu said coldly.

Qin Yu, who was at the side, raised his head with difficulty and looked at Zhong Wu.

He stared at Zhong Wu and said, “In other words... the poison that I was poisoned with is the same as the poison that the leader was poisoned with?”

“That’s right! How is it? Do you feel honored?”Zhong Wu mocked.

“Why? Why did you poison the team leader...”Qin Yu forced his body and said in pain.

Zhong wu sneered, “If he doesn’t die, how will I have a chance to rise to the top?” Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Hearing this, the corner of Qin Yu’s mouth could not help but reveal a smile.

His smile became more exuberant, and in the end, he raised his head and laughed loudly.

......

Zhong wu frowned slightly and said with a cold face, “What are you laughing at?”

Qin Yu sneered, “I’m laughing at your stupidity.”

“What do you mean?”Zhong Wu’s face changed.

There was no longer any pain on Qin Yu’s face. What replaced it was a cold face.

Then, Qin Yu looked at the door and shouted, “You all heard it, the leader was killed by Zhong Wu. He has admitted it himself!”

As soon as he said this, the door slowly opened.

The people outside also walked in with grief and indignation.

“Zhong Wu, the team leader was indeed killed by you!”

“We all heard it. What else do you have to say!”

Zhong Wu’s face turned extremely ugly! He glared at Qin Yu and shouted, “Are you playing with me?”

“I am playing with you. So What?”Qin Yu sneered.

Zhong Wu was furious, but he quickly calmed down.

“So what if they know? You’re already a dead man,”Zhong Wu said coldly.

Qin Yu couldn’t help but laugh when he heard that. “How about I call you stupid? Looks like you’re even more stupid than I imagined.”

“What did you say!”Zhong Wu held the white bone club and glared at Qin Yu.

Qin Yu sneered. “Do you really think I didn’t see through your scheme? Do you really think this poison is useful to me?”

“You... What do you mean!”Zhong Wu suddenly had an extremely ominous premonition.

Qin Yu stopped his waist and said coldly, “Zhong Wu, today is the day you die. Go Down and explain to the team leader.”

“You tricked me? Do you think I will fall for it!”Zhong Wu said angrily.

Qin Yu sneered and said, “Whether it’s to trick you or not, you can try and find out.”

Zhong Wu’s expression became uglier and uglier, and his heart was filled with terror.

He grabbed the white bone club and did not dare to make a move for a moment.

“What? You’re so timid even with the white bone club? You’re really trash,”Qin Yu said with a sneer.

“You’re courting death!”Zhong wu finally could not hold it in anymore. He held the white bone club and headed straight for Qin Yu’s face!

Qin Yu immediately stepped on the line word formula and retreated backwards.

“Boom!”

The white bone club smashed onto the ground, and a huge shockwave instantly overturned the house!

“Everyone, retreat,”Qin Yu said coldly.

Everyone obviously knew that this was a great battle that they couldn’t participate in. They all followed Qin Yu’s request and quickly shot backwards.

Zhong Wu glared at Qin Yu and said through gritted teeth, “Qin Yu, I don’t want to be your enemy, nor do I want to poison you. If you weren’t so aggressive, I wouldn’t have wanted to kill you!”

“So? What do you want to express?”Qin Yu raised his eyebrows.

Zhong wu suppressed his anger and said, “If you are willing, I can give you the position of team leader! Let you be the team leader! I will assist you!”

“Oh?”Qin Yu raised his eyebrows. “Okay, then give me the white bone club.”

Zhong Wu looked at the white bone club in his hand. He gritted his teeth and said, “No, if you hand over the White Bone Club, you will definitely not let me off!”

“TSK TSK, if you are not even willing to hand over the white bone club, how can I believe your sincerity?”Qin Yu sneered.

Zhong Wu was conflicted for a moment.

With the white bone, he originally thought that he would not be afraid of anything.

However, when he saw the crack on the iron door of the dungeon, he became timid.

He gritted his teeth and said, “If I hand over the white bone to you, will you let me go?”

Qin Yu sneered and said, “No.”

“You! Are you really going to make such a scene? The white bone in my hand is not to be trifled with!”Zhong Wu said coldly.

Qin Yu nodded slightly and said, “That’s right. The white bone club in your hand is indeed a treasure, but unfortunately, you are a waste.”

“Qin Yu, you are going too far!”Zhong wu finally could not hold it in anymore!

He held the white bone club in his hand and headed straight for Qin Yu!

Qin Yu’s expression was ice-cold. His body was suffused with a golden light, and his right fist was like a golden sun.

Not only did Qin Yu not have the slightest intention of dodging this strike, he even revealed a trace of excitement!

“Qin Yu is planning to take on the white bone staff head-on!”

“Using his physical body? Using his physical body to take on the white bone staff head-on? Isn’t that courting death?”

“Although Qin Yu’s abilities aren’t ordinary, this white bone staff... is a holy weapon.”

The white bone staff headed straight for Qin Yu, and Qin Yu’s body similarly surged with a strong battle intent!

Just as the great white bone club was approaching, Qin Yu moved.

He clenched his Golden Fist and roared as he directly faced the Great White Bone Club!

“Boom!”

A loud sound exploded at this moment, as if the world had exploded!

A crack instantly appeared under Qin Yu’s feet.

This crack extended for several kilometers, as if it had split the hunter organization into two!

Although this white bone staff was not a revived holy weapon, its power was still beyond imagination!

Qin Yu only felt pain in his fist. Even his bones seemed to have been affected!

“As expected of a holy weapon.”Qin Yu lowered his head to look at his fist and muttered softly.

The onlookers looked at each other in dismay.

How Strong was Qin Yu’s physical body? He was actually unharmed by the white bone staff’s attack?

Zhong Wu’s expression changed drastically! Cold Sweat kept breaking out on his forehead!

If even the white bone staff couldn’t defeat Qin Yu, he would definitely die today!

“Such a treasure in your hands is really a waste,”Qin Yu lamented.

Anyone who liked to play tricks would often be hindered in their cultivation, and their dao heart was often unstable. Zhong Wu was no exception.

Qin Yu looked at Zhong Wu and said indifferently, “Do you still think that this white bone club can save your life?”

Zhong Wu didn’t give up. He gritted his teeth and said, “Qin Yu, everything is negotiable. Why do you have to fight to the death?”

“Fight to the death? Do you think you have the right to say that?”Qin Yu mocked.

“You... you are going too far. Don’t think that I’m really afraid of You!”Zhong Wu’s face was filled with madness, and he kept roaring.
