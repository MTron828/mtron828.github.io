Chapter 1480: Chapter 1,480, the white-robed Daoist reappeared

Su song respectfully explained, “Mr. Qin, it’s like this. Someone has been wanting to visit you for the past few days. I was afraid that I would disturb your pill refinement, so I specially stayed here.”

Qin Yu couldn’t help but be a little surprised. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Su Song’s attitude had changed a little too much.

“Okay, then thank you very much.”Qin Yu said perfunctorily.

After that, Qin Yu went to the pharmacy and brought a batch of herbs, just in case he needed them.

After doing all this, Qin Yu planned to leave.

However, when many alchemists heard that Qin Yu was leaving, they all surrounded him, wanting to seek advice from Qin Yu.

Qin Yu only felt a headache. These alchemists were all stubborn. If he didn’t satisfy them, they would probably chase him to the ends of the Earth.

The Pill King in the dark became more and more furious as he watched.

He clenched his fists tightly, wishing that he could immediately kill Qin Yu.

“This kid really wants to leave,”the pill king said coldly.

If he had known earlier, he wouldn’t have needed to inform the heavenly cloud sect.

In this way, he had become a narrow-minded person.

“Forget it. Since I’ve already informed them, I’ll just be a bad person until the end.”The Pill King’s eyes turned cold.

After that, he pushed open the door and walked towards Qin Yu.

“Mr. Qin.”The Alchemy King bowed slightly to Qin Yu.

Qin Yu glanced at him and said, “I’m planning to leave. Please help me and ask them to move aside.”

The alchemy king smiled and said, “Mr. Qin, everyone is very curious about your alchemy skills. Seeing that everyone is so enthusiastic, why don’t we stay for another two days and teach some lessons?”

Qin Yu raised his brows and couldn’t help but be a little surprised.

In Qin Yu’s impression, this alchemy king was a narrow-minded person. He was afraid that someone would snatch his position. How could he be so magnanimous today?

“Mr. Qin, if you can teach everyone two moves, it will be a good thing for our entire Medicine Sacred Hall,”the Alchemy King continued.

“That’s right, Mr. Qin. We won’t take too long.”

“We’ve never seen a pill refining genius like you before. Please Pass on your insights and experience to us. Please!”

The Alchemist king was about to explode from anger, but he still had to endure it forcefully, afraid that Qin Yu would see through him.

Qin Yu thought for a moment, then nodded and said, “Alright then. After all, I took a lot of things from here. Take it as a return for all of you.”

The alchemy king at the side immediately heaved a sigh of relief.

As long as he thought of a way to keep Qin Yu here, his mission would be accomplished.

“Then thank you very much.”The Alchemy King said with a smile.

Qin Yu acknowledged and said, “Quickly find a room and arrange it. I’m in a hurry.”

“Alright.”The Alchemy King hurriedly nodded.

Following that, he arranged a room for Qin Yu so that Qin Yu could give a lecture.

This was an extremely huge room that could accommodate hundreds of people.

Almost everyone in the entire medicine Saint Hall could participate.

The room was already filled with people in less than five minutes. Among these people, many of them were already on the verge of death, but their alchemy skills were still quite mediocre.

Seeing their persistence, Qin Yu’s heart was also somewhat moved.

“Let me say this first. I can only share my personal experience. If everyone has any questions, I will definitely know everything,”Qin Yu said.

“Of course, if I don’t speak well, I hope everyone can understand.”

Thus, Qin Yu’s class officially began.

He first introduced the Earth’s resources and environment to everyone, and then he mentioned many of Earth’s outstanding alchemists.

For example, the Divine Alchemist Pavilion Master, and then Xiang Danqing.

This class would take a total of two days, but Qin Yu didn’t expect that these people were even more enthusiastic than he imagined.

One question after another, Qin Yu had almost no time to rest.

On the other side.

The Alchemy King didn’t participate in this lecture.

There was no other reason, only because he didn’t want to admit that he couldn’t compare to Qin Yu.

“According to this world, the first elder and the others should be arriving soon,”the pill refining king thought to himself.

He closed his eyes slightly and tried to maintain his state of mind. However, the lively sounds in the room made it impossible for him to calm down.

Hence, the pill refining king simply stood up and walked out of the Medicine Sacred Hall.

He quietly waited for the people of the Heavenly Cloud sect near the Medicine Sacred Hall.

As time passed by, the alchemist King became more and more anxious.

He would occasionally raise his head to look at the Medicine Sacred Hall behind him, and his heart grew more and more worried.

“This Qin Yu... Won’t take the opportunity to occupy the medicine sacred hall as his own, right?”The Alchemist king narrowed his eyes slightly.

If Qin Yu took all the alchemists away, then this medicine sacred hall would most likely only be in name but not in reality.

Just as the Alchemy King was worried, he suddenly felt a powerful internal Qi approaching.

The Alchemy King’s eyes lit up, then he excitedly muttered, “It’s Here!”

He raised his head and looked in the direction of the internal QI, feeling extremely excited.

“Little Bastard, let’s see how long you can be arrogant!”The Alchemy King said angrily in his heart.

Soon, a few figures appeared in the sky.

The leader was the white-robed Daoist, and behind him was the famous eighteen deities of the Heavenly Cloud sect!

From the moment he appeared to the front, it was not even a breath’s time.

Seeing the newcomer, the alchemist King hurriedly cupped his hands and said, “Greetings, sir. I am from the Medicine Sacred Hall...”

“Alright, there’s no need to introduce yourself.”The white-robed Daoist rudely interrupted the alchemist King’s words.

This made the narrow-minded alchemist King furious once again!

In just a few short days, he had already been ignored by many people!

“Just tell us where Qin Yu is. As for who you are, we aren’t interested.”The eighteen gods behind him spoke at the same time.

The Alchemist king raised his head to look at the eighteen gods behind him.

The eighteen gods were extremely famous in the South Province, so the alchemist King had naturally heard of them.

“Even the eighteen gods have been mobilized. Qin Yu, you’re dead meat!”The Alchemy King couldn’t help but be overjoyed in his heart!

“What are you standing there for? Are You Deaf? Hurry up and lead the way.”The white-robed Daoist said somewhat unhappily.

“Yes, everyone, please follow me.”The alchemy king nodded.

Following that, the white-robed Daoist followed behind the alchemy king and walked towards the roof.

As for the eighteen gods, they used extremely fast speed to set up an inescapable formation in the vicinity to prevent Qin Yu from escaping!

The eighteen gods stood in the air like emotionless killing machines.

Within the Medicine Saint Hall, Qin Yu, who was giving a lecture, suddenly frowned.

“This aura... is so familiar!”Qin Yu’s expression changed slightly! “Internal Qi!”!

Qin Yu did not encounter many people with such a powerful internal Qi. In an instant, Qin Yu guessed the identity of the other party!

“Mr. Qin, you haven’t answered my question,”someone below said.

Qin Yu did not say anything. He only looked coldly in the direction of the door.

“Bang!”

Soon, the door was violently opened.
