Chapter 1121: Chapter 1,121, the pavilion master’s words 

After half a month, this mighty figure had finally appeared.

He took a deep breath and raised his head to the sky to sigh: “Finally, finally walked out from the seal... . .”

At that moment, he suddenly turned to look at Yun long and said in a cold voice: “Have you found out anything about that brat?”

Yun long quickly said: “Please Rest assured master, I have already found out that this person’s name is Qin Yu and he is in the fire country.”

“Alright.”The mighty figure placed his hands behind his back as he snorted coldly.

“Follow me to the fire country, to Pyro.”

“We can use this person to announce that our Tian Zong has returned!”

“Yes!”

... . .

That night.

The news of a mighty figure being born spread out on the martial arts forum.

Late at night, Tian Ji Zi announced on the Martial Arts Forum:

A mighty figure was born today, and his name is Tian Zong. He will arrive in the fire country in a few days to look for Qin Yu.

The news had already been spread, and the entire martial arts forum was in an uproar.

One had to know that the mighty figure had long disappeared from this world, and now that a mighty figure had suddenly appeared, it could be said to be earth-shattering!

“There’s actually a mighty figure in this world? Even a mighty figure has appeared? Looks like the holy region this time has attracted a lot of people.”

“Why is the first thing that a mighty figure does when he appears is to look for Qin Yu?”

“Qin Yu can be said to be the number one person in this world. If we don’t look for him, who else would we look for?”

“This time, I’m Afraid Qin Yu will really be in trouble. That’s a mighty figure. No matter how strong Qin Yu is, he won’t be able to fight against a mighty figure.”

There were many different opinions, and they discussed it for almost an entire night.

Looking at the news on the martial arts forum, Ye Qing couldn’t help but sigh.

“These past few years really haven’t been peaceful...”

Back then, although the Jingdu martial arts association was dominant, on the surface, it was calm and peaceful.

Ever since Qin Yu appeared, the entire martial arts world seemed to have changed.

Martial Saints emerged endlessly, and now, even mighty figures had emerged.

A mighty figure, even the country could not step forward to stop him.

Because the strength of a mighty figure was too powerful! It was not inferior to any hot weapons of the current era.

Heaven Gate.

Pavilion Master had also been trying to break through these few days.

With the strange flower left behind by Qin Yu, it would not be difficult for him to become a martial saint.

“Qin Yu, Get Out Here!”

At this moment, an explosive shout came from outside!

The sound was like rolling thunder and it shook the entire Heaven Gate until it buzzed!

The disciples who were weaker were even shaken until the world spun and they fell to the ground, unable to get up!

Pavilion master suddenly opened his eyes and said in a low voice, “They are here.”

Jiang he also stepped out of the gate and walked out of the mountain gate.

He saw an old man and a young man standing at the entrance of the Heaven Gate.

The young man was arrogant and angry.

The old man had his hands behind his back. His internal Qi was as calm as water, but it was so deep that people couldn’t see through it.

“Why didn’t Qin Yu come out? Why did an old man and a woman come out?”Yun long scolded.

Tian Zong said indifferently, “Yun long, don’t be rude.”

Hearing this, Yun long retreated to the side.

Pavilion master walked forward, cupped his hands and said, “Greetings, senior.”

Tian Zong said indifferently, “No need to talk nonsense. Let Qin Yu come out.”

Pavilion master smiled and said, “Senior Tian Zong, Qin Yu is not in the Heaven Gate. I’m afraid it will be a little difficult for you to see him today.”

Before Tian Zong could speak, pavilion master continued, “Before Qin Yu left, he said that you are an almighty with high moral standing and a well-known reputation. I think you will not make things difficult for his disciples. After all, there is a head for grievances and there is a head for debts.”

These words made Tian Zong, who was about to flare up, unable to back down.

Tian Zong sized up pavilion master and said indifferently, “I’m afraid that these words were not said by Qin Yu. It was you who said it.”

“Senior, you are wise. However, I think that these are also the words from Qin Yu’s heart,”pavilion master said with a smile.

Tian Zong closed his eyes slightly and said indifferently, “It’s useless to say these words. I will never stop until I find Qin Yu. Similarly, in order to find him, it is not impossible to use some extraordinary means.”

Pavilion master hurriedly smiled and said, “Senior Tian Zong, Qin Yu will return very soon. Moreover... I think a big shot like you won’t take it out on US juniors. Otherwise, won’t you be ridiculed by the world?”

“You are, after all, the only almighty in the present realm. How could you ruin your reputation because of a few lives that are not worth mentioning?”

These words were said with great standards. Not only did they flatter Tian Zong, they also made Tian Zong have no reason to make a move.

He glanced at pavilion master and said indifferently, “What a sharp tongue.”

“Senior, you’re joking. It’s because senior is calm. Otherwise, no matter what I say, I can’t Change Your Mind.”Pavilion master laughed.

“Hahaha!”Tian Zong couldn’t help but laugh loudly.

He said indifferently, “Alright, I’ll give you this face! But you have to tell me when Qin Yu can come back. I Can’t wait for him forever, right?”

Pavilion master thought for a moment and said, “Within ten days.”

“Too long.”Tian Zong shook his head.

“I’ll only give him three days.”

Pavilion master frowned slightly, but she did not panic. Instead, she continued, “Senior, the path of cultivation is dull and long, and you haven’t appeared for a long time. Why Don’t you take this opportunity to roam the mortal world?” Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

These words undoubtedly touched the heart of Tian Zong.

Tian Zong, who had been sealed for a thousand years, was indeed somewhat infatuated with the mortal world.

He sized up pavilion master and said indifferently, “Alright, I’ll give you five days.”

“If I don’t see Qin Yu in five days, don’t blame me for being impolite.”

Pavilion master knew that five days was his limit, so he did not continue to be involved.

“Senior, please take a seat. I will instruct someone to prepare a meal for you,”pavilion master said.

“After the meal, I will personally arrange the next five days’journey for you. I guarantee that you will be satisfied.”

“Okay!”Tian Zong waved his hand and stepped into the Heaven Gate.

Only after he had walked far away did pavilion master let out a sigh of relief.

“You really have some skills.”Jiang he could not help but sigh.

Pavilion master did not respond to this, but said: “Immediately get someone to arrange the food, go to the nightclub to find a few women to accompany him.”
