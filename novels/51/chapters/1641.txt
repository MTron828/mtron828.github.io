A loud sound spread out in all directions. The divine general was instantly smashed into scrap metal by Qin Yu’s Iron Fist!

The power of this punch shocked everyone!

One had to know that this divine general was known to be comparable to those at the reversion void stage! Although there was water in his words, it was enough to show how terrifying this divine general was!

However, such a divine general was directly destroyed by Qin Yu’s punch! Its power was unimaginable!

“F * CK, My Divine General!”Master Zhengyang slapped his thigh and ran over quickly.

Qin Yu was immersed in joy.

He looked at his own fist and whispered, “This divine general is indeed not as powerful as I imagined. Perhaps my fist is too powerful...”

With this body, Qin Yu was not afraid even when facing the godly monarch of the northern lands.

“Hahahaha, it seems that this method is indeed effective! The body and realm can indeed be separated!”Wen wanyi laughed loudly.

With that said, he walked to Qin Yu’s side and said in a deep voice, “Alright, this body of yours can already shake those people of the northern lands. Let’s not waste any more time. We will return immediately.”

“Mm.”Qin Yu nodded.

He was just about to leave when the brawny man walked over with Xiao Cao.

“Stay and have a meal before you leave,”said the Brawny Man.

Qin Yu was startled. He thought about it. He had troubled the other party quite a bit during this period of time. It was indeed inappropriate to just leave like this.

Therefore, Qin Yu agreed, “Alright, then we’ll leave tomorrow.”

That night, Qin Yu, Wen Wanyun, and Xiaocao had a meal together.

At the dining table, the Brawny man couldn’t help but sigh, “The situation in the northern lands is getting more and more intense. They can step into the weapon refining city at any time.”

Hearing this, Qin Yu frowned slightly.

He looked at the Brawny Man and said in a deep voice, “Has the northern lands started to take action?”

“Don’t you know?”The burly man could not help but feel a little surprised.

After that, he told Qin Yu about the recent events.

“I really didn’t expect that the nine caves of the southern region would still be alive,”the burly man sighed.

Qin Yu did not listen to him. He did not expect the northern lands to take action so quickly and that an elementalist had also arrived.

“The northern land’s leader when he was young...”Qin Yu muttered softly.

Wen wanye said in a deep voice, “Rumor has it that the Northern Lands’Lord should have been revived by now. Because of Xiao Hai, his revival was incomplete.”

“Sigh.”Wen wanye sighed slightly when he said this.

“Xiao Hai has indeed delayed the Northern Lands’Lord’s revival time. However... in this way, I’m afraid that more people will die. The Northern Lands’Lord needs to absorb more people.”

Qin Yu glanced at Wen Wanyi and shook his head. “I don’t think so.”

“First, senior Xiao Hai’s purpose for this trip should be to wait for an opportunity to kill the northern Lord who has yet to revive. It’s just that he failed.”

“Second, even if the northern lord fully recovers, do you think he will let go of the southern region? He will only crazily absorb the southern region cultivators to continue cultivating and raise his cultivation.”

After hearing Qin Yu’s words, Wen Wanyi also came to a sudden realization.

He said in a low voice, “I was thinking too simply.”

At this moment, there was no lack of anxiety in Qin Yu’s heart. He couldn’t wait to go back.

For an entire night, Qin Yu tossed and turned, unable to fall asleep no matter how hard he tried.

Just like that, he stayed up for an entire night. The next day, after Qin Yu woke up, he hurriedly left the weapon refining city.

...

“Boom!”

In a certain no-man’s-land, a great battle was breaking out.

He Teng’s entire body was covered in black energy, forcing Yong Ji to continuously retreat.

In the end, an extremely terrifying phenomenon appeared behind him!

This phenomenon was like an evil ghost from the netherworld. It was sinister and terrifying. Two large hands ruthlessly slapped on Yong Ji’s body.

“PFFT!”

Under this heavy blow, Yong Ji finally could not hold on any longer. He was ruthlessly slammed onto the ground. His entire body was bleeding non-stop, and his internal Qi was rapidly weakening.

He Teng stood in front of Yong Ji, and the strange phenomenon behind him slowly disappeared.

“What’s wrong? Is this all our three Ultimate’s abilities?”He Teng said with a sinister smile.

Yong Ji opened his mouth, and a mouthful of blood spewed out.

“Where did you come from...”Yong Ji spat out these words with great difficulty.

He couldn’t figure it out. One Qin Yu was enough. Why was there another he teng now?

He Teng put his hands behind his back and said indifferently, “You don’t need to know. Yong Ji, i advise you to be honest. This way, you and I still have a chance to cooperate. Otherwise... I don’t mind sending you on your way ahead of Time...”

Yong Ji, who was already furious, was immediately angered to the point of vomiting blood when he heard these words.

He did not know when it began, but he, one of the top three uniques, had slowly fallen into the bottom tier.

Although Yong Ji was unconvinced, he had no other choice at the moment. He could only coldly agree.

...

Heavenly Cloud sect.

This place seemed to have become the headquarters of the northern lands.

There was a divine king who was personally in charge of this place. The densely packed Black Cannon men were also monitoring everyone.

During this period of time, the disciples of the Heavenly Cloud sect had seen too many people fall. They had seen with their own eyes how the picture scroll absorbed the divine sense and primordial spirit of cultivators.

For a moment, the entire heavenly cloud sect was trembling in fear, afraid that it would be their turn next.

Fortunately, this divine king had always been afraid of the sect master of the Heavenly Cloud sect, so he had made his move against the disciples of the Heavenly Cloud sect.

In the Great Hall, the deputy sect master sighed repeatedly. From time to time, he would look at the Cultivation Mountain, as though he was anticipating something.

But in the blink of an eye, several days had passed. Xiao Sheng still showed no signs of returning.

On this day. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Just as the godly monarch of the northern lands was about to leave the Tianyun sect, he suddenly sensed traces of a powerful internal Qi.

This internal Qi could not help but make people shudder. Even the godly monarch of the northern lands felt a little apprehensive.

“Who is it! ?”

The Divine King suddenly shouted.

However, what responded to him was silence.

The divine king frowned slightly. He released his divine sense and covered the entire Tianyun sect.

Soon, he sensed the source of that internal Qi.

“It’s... Cultivation Mountain!”The Divine King exclaimed.

Although the Cultivation Mountain had experienced a great battle, it still stood there like a landmark.

The Godly monarch had a bad premonition. He muttered softly, “The Cultivation Mountain... could it be the sect master of the Tianyun sect? !”

He could not help but feel a little worried. For a moment, he did not know what to do.

“It might be another one of their tricks,”the godly monarch thought to himself.

Thinking of this, he immediately shot towards the Cultivation Mountain!

However, the moment he stepped on the Cultivation Mountain, the godly monarch regretted it.

This was because this aura was none other than the sect master of the Tianyun sect!

“I let you escape last time, but you still dare to step on the Cultivation Mountain this time?”

Xiao Sheng’s voice came from all directions. It was extremely ethereal, but at that moment, it sounded like a life-threatening talisman to the godly monarch’s ears!
