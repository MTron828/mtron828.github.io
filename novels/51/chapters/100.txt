Chapter 101: Old Servant vs Yan Jiang Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

The old servant walked towards Qin Yu step by step. The distance between the two of them was getting closer and closer.

Qin Yu’s expression didn’t change. He was calm and collected, but a strong belligerent desire rose from the bottom of his heart.

Ever since he saw Yan Jiang’s abilities the last time, Qin Yu had been filled with interest towards these so-called martial arts masters!

The old servant looked at Qin Yu coldly and said in a low voice, “Kid, you are dead meat today!”

After saying that, the old servant suddenly released a terrifying pressure! This pressure made Qin Yu’s face turn pale with fright! It was as if two huge mountains were pressed down on his shoulders in an instant!

“Hahahaha!” The old servant couldn’t help but laugh out loud proudly.

“This is the power of Inner Strength!” After saying that, the old servant suddenly took a step forward. His hands turned into claws and reached towards Qin Yu’s chest fiercely!

Qin Yu hurriedly dodged to the side. The old servant’s palm brushed past Qin Yu’s chest, and a long tear appeared on his clothes!

“How fast!” Qin Yu couldn’t help but feel awed!

This old man’s strength was probably even stronger than Qin Yu had imagined!

“Boom!” At this moment, the old servant had already stretched out his second hand!

His old hand clenched into a fist and thrust towards Qin Yu’s chest!

“Boom boom boom boom!”

Qin Yu was knocked back repeatedly and almost fell to the ground!

“How strong!” Qin Yu’s face was full of astonishment.

It seemed that these martial arts masters were really quite skilled!

“Why aren’t you fighting back? Is that all you’ve got?” The old servant said indifferently with his hands behind his back.

Qin Yu clenched his fist and adjusted his internal qi to the maximum. Then, with a swoosh, he pounced towards the old servant! VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“Go to h*ll!” Qin Yu shouted, and a wisp of white qi actually appeared on his fist!

The old servant’s expression didn’t change. He calmly waited for Qin Yu’s punch.

In the blink of an eye, the two of them had already exchanged more than ten blows, but Qin Yu was stunned that he didn’t even manage to touch the old servant!

“This old man’s strength is beyond imagination.” A sense of solemnity appeared in Qin Yu’s heart.

The Liu family of South City lived up to their reputation!

In the car, Yan Ruoxue was snacking while watching the show through the car window.

Although she had a noble status, she didn’t know martial arts. She couldn’t even tell who was stronger and who was weaker.

“Qin Yu, go for it!” Yan Ruoxue stretched out her hand and shouted to the outside.

Qin Yu immediately looked in Yan Ruoxue’s direction. He took a deep breath, looked at the old man coldly and said, “Again!”

After saying that, Qin Yu launched a second round of attacks!

He threw powerful punches of high frequency and speed!

However, the old servant’s body was extremely agile. Every time, he could easily dodge Qin Yu’s punches.

“Bang!”

Taking advantage of the gap between Qin Yu’s attacks, the old servant waved his big hand and grabbed Qin Yu’s arm!

“First, I will cripple one of your arms. Then, I will slowly torture you.” A hint of viciousness flashed in the old servant’s eyes.

Very soon, Qin Yu felt a huge force on his arm!

“Oh no!” Qin Yu thought to himself. He clenched his other fist and used all the strength in his body to punch the old servant!

The old servant’s expression changed. He hurriedly let go of Qin Yu and retreated backward!

A hint of coldness gradually appeared on his aged face.

“Kid, it seems that I’ve really underestimated you.” The old servant sneered.

“Stop playing around. Finish the battle quickly and don’t cause any more trouble!” Not far away, Liu Shihui said coldly.

The old servant nodded and said, “Yes, Young Master.”

As soon as he finished speaking, the old servant’s internal qi rose once again!

An even more terrifying pressure threatened to crush Qin Yu’s bones!

“Kid, the young master has spoken. He wants you dead,” the old servant said coldly.

“Remember to reincarnate more luckily in your next life.”

With that said, the old servant instantly disappeared. In the blink of an eye, he appeared in front of Qin Yu!

His fist lit up with a faint gleam and he instantly thrust it towards Qin Yu!

At such a close distance, there was nowhere to hide!

With no other choice, Qin Yu could only clench his fist and face it head-on.

“Boom!”

Their two fists collided, creating a loud explosion!

Qin Yu retreated seven to eight steps in succession before he stabilized his body!

But even so, Qin Yu still felt as if his arm was about to be broken!

“D*mn it...” Qin Yu, his expression somewhat unsightly, couldn’t help but grit his teeth.

“If I reach the Foundation Establishment Stage, killing this old man would be a piece of cake!” Qin Yu thought to himself.

“You have the guts to be so arrogant with such little ability? You’re just a piece of trash.” The old servant came in front of Qin Yu again.

Qin Yu waved his hand and sneered. “Trash? You’re on the brink of death, yet this is all you’ve got. And I have only just started my cultivation path for a short month. Which of the two of us is really trash?”

When he heard this, the old man’s expression couldn’t help but change!

“You’re courting death!” The old servant suddenly shouted and reached out to grab Qin Yu’s neck!

He lifted Qin Yu up into the air like he was holding a chicken!

Qin Yu’s face slowly flushed and he felt that it was becoming difficult for him to breathe. The internal qi all over his body seemed to be suppressed!

“You reckless thing, I will break your neck right now!” The old servant shouted coldly, and then the strength in his hand began to slowly increase!

Qin Yu felt waves of pain coming from his neck, as if it was about to be broken!

“Let him go.”

At this moment, a voice suddenly sounded!

Turning around, he saw a young man in a suit walking out.

He looked at the old servant coldly and said word by word, “Let him go.”

The old servant narrowed his eyes and snorted. “Who are you? We are the Liu family of South City. If you don’t want to die, get lost!”

“I said, let him go!” However, the other party completely ignored the old servant’s words!

Qin Yu, who was lifted up in the air, was even more shocked!

“Yan... Yan Jiang?” Qin Yu squeezed out a name.

The old servant seemed to be a little angry.

He threw Qin Yu aside and then looked at Yan Jiang.

“What’s going on today? There’re so many reckless b*stards,” the old servant said with narrowed eyes.

Then, the old servant looked in Liu Shihui’s direction.

Liu Shihui waved his hand and said coldly, “Kill all those who obstruct us.”

“Yes.” The old servant bowed slightly and then walked towards Yan Jiang.

Yan Jiang glanced at Qin Yu and said coldly, “Go to the car and stay there.”

Qin Yu frowned and said, “I’ll help you. This old man is quite strong.”

Yan Jiang said with a cold expression, “I told you to get in the car. Keep an eye on Miss Yan!”

Hearing this, Qin Yu didn’t say anything more. He could only turn his head and walk to the car.

After Qin Yu got into the car, Yan Ruoxue hurriedly asked, “Are you okay?”

“I’m fine.” Qin Yu shook his arm and then said with a joking tone, “Give me a few more days. I won’t even need to use a move to kill this old man!”

There was a huge difference between the Foundation Establishment Stage and the Qi Refining Stage. Qin Yu was confident that once he entered the Foundation Establishment Stage, even the entire Liu family wouldn’t be a threat to him.

Outside the car, Yan Jiang stood with his hands behind his back and looked at the old servant quietly.

The old servant sneered. “Young man, it’s not too late to regret now.”
