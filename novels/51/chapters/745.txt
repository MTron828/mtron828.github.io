Chapter 746: Breakthrough! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

No one knew what kind of power the Jingdu Martial Arts Association possessed.

But everyone had a common understanding.

In terms of martial power alone, no one could compare to the Jingdu Martial Arts Association, not even the major families of Jingdu.

And the reason why the Jingdu Martial Arts Association was afraid of the major families of Jingdu was purely because of their capital and connections.

...

Qin Yu, man with the mustache, and the others temporarily stayed in the Tang family’s home.

With the Tang family’s help, Qin Yu could cultivate in seclusion in peace.

Around the courtyard was a deserted mountain forest.

The mountain forest was incomparably quiet. From time to time, a breeze blew past, and the leaves rustled.

Qin Yu took out the Iceheart Lake from his Spatial Magic Artifact and placed this ten-thousand-year-old herb in front of him.

“I’ve been stalling it for a long time. Now, with this ten-thousand-year-old herb, I can try to directly enter the late stage of the Martial Marquis Realm,” Qin Yu said in a deep voice.

After experiencing so much, Qin Yu gradually understood that the spiritual energy he needed for cultivation seemed to be much more than others.

Therefore, even with so many treasures, Qin Yu didn’t dare to ask for too much.

“It’s better to use this ten-thousand-year-old herb to refine pills,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

With a thought, a medicinal cauldron with a dragon statue carved on it landed in front of him.

This medicinal cauldron was given to Qin Yu by the Pavilion Master back then.

“A ten-thousand-year-old herb... can be used to refine Divine Rank pills at the very least,” Qin Yu said in a low voice.

He closed his eyes and began to search for the pill formula.

A few minutes later, Qin Yu locked onto the pill formula called “Purple-gold Pill”.

This kind of pill could maximize the spiritual energy of the herb and ensure the compatibility between the spiritual energy and the human body.

“One ten-thousand-year-old herb can refine at least ten Purple-gold Pills,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

He put the ten-thousand-year-old herb into the cauldron, and then a purple spiritual fire lit up in his palm.

Qin Yu flicked his finger and threw the flame into the cauldron. In a moment, the cauldron was ablaze with flames.

Qin Yu closed his eyes, held his breath, and controlled the flame, focusing all his spiritual sense on refining pills.

Under the urging of the spiritual flame, the ten-thousand-year-old herb began to dissolve bit by bit before turning into medicinal juice.

The rich medicinal juice brought waves of refreshing internal qi. This fragrance was locked into the cauldron to prevent the medicinal efficacy from being lost.

In the blink of an eye, three days had passed.

Three days later, a strange phenomenon suddenly flashed in the sky. One after another, strange clouds hung high in the sky.

“The Pill Cloud has taken shape,” Tang Sheng from the Tang family couldn’t help but whisper.

“Wow, it’s really beautiful. I’ve never seen such a beautiful Pill Cloud before!” Tang Mo said in surprise.

The Tang Clan raised many alchemists. They had also refined medicinal pills before, but this kind of Pill Cloud had never appeared before.

The man with the mustache also raised his head to look at the sky.

He narrowed his eyes and said in a deep voice, “From this Pill Cloud, this is a sign of the birth of a Divine Rank medicinal pill.”

In the entire world, there weren’t many people who could refine a Divine Rank medicinal pill. Even in the renowned Divine Alchemist Pavilion, not many people could refine a Divine Rank medicinal pill.

“Swoosh!”

At this moment, the Pill Cloud in the sky was suddenly penetrated by a few bullet-like rays of light!

Immediately after, a golden figure soared into the sky. With a wave of his large hand, the golden palm instantly blotted out the sky and covered the sun!

“Swoosh!”

The palm extended for dozens of meters and grabbed the pill in his hand.

The Pill Cloud in the sky was also completely dispersed!

Qin Yu opened his palm and looked at the few pills in his hand.

“There are only six pills.” Qin Yu frowned.

It was a little less than he had imagined.

“Six should be enough,” Qin Yu said in a low voice.

After all, this was a Purple-gold Pill.

For others, a Purple-gold Pill was enough to advance from the middle stage to the late stage of the Martial Marquis Realm.

“Next, it’s time to try and break through,” Qin Yu said in a deep voice.

He sat cross-legged on the ground, and the spiritual energy that he had suppressed for a long time began to surge at this moment!

The sea-like spiritual energy filled his entire body, and the wild wind in the mountain forest surged with swooshing sounds!

Qin Yu could have advanced to the intermediate stage of the Martial Marquis realm a long time ago, but he had been suppressing his cultivation.

Now that the suppression was lifted, the terrifying spiritual energy exploded like a rebound!

Qin Yu reached out his hand and stuffed the Purple-gold Pill into his mouth.

At the same time, Qin Yu swallowed the remaining Iceheart Lake into his stomach!

Such a terrifying spiritual energy was like a vast ocean, instantly engulfing Qin Yu’s entire body!

His golden core was spinning in the center of the spiritual energy. The spiritual energy moved along with it, forming a small vortex in his body.

The overly dense spiritual energy filled Qin Yu’s body, causing wisps of white qi to condense around his body.

Qin Yu frowned and broke out in cold sweat. He forcefully endured the burden of the spiritual energy on his body.

It was naturally not easy to step into the advanced stage of the Martial Marquis Realm in one go. However, for the current Qin Yu, this was the fastest speed.

Time passed by minute by minute, and in the blink of an eye, a week had passed.

Tang Mo, the man with the mustache, and the others from the Tang family couldn’t help but be a bit worried.

“It’s been a week. Why is there still no movement?” Tang Mo frowned and asked.

“There’s no internal qi fluctuation in Qin Yu’s position,” said Tang Sheng in a deep voice.

At this point, Tang Mo looked at the man with the mustache and said, “Shouldn’t you go and have a look?”

The man with the mustache shook his head and said, “Qin Yu said that he won’t allow anyone to come near him during his closed-door cultivation. He said that he was afraid of any accidents.”

“I’ll go and take a look,” Xiao Yu stood up and said.

The man with the mustache hurriedly stopped Xiao Yu and shook his head. “That won’t do. Qin Yu told me before he went into closed-door cultivation that I must keep an eye on you no matter what.”

Xiao Yu frowned. Her beautiful eyes looked at the man with the mustache with a hint of coldness.

The man with the mustache shivered and subconsciously took two steps back.

Although the two of them had been together for a long time, the man with the mustache was still full of fear toward Xiao Yu.

“I’ll send someone to take a look,” said Tang Mo at this time.

The man with the mustache waved his hand and said, “Forget it. I’ll go.”

Just as the few of them were arguing, a burst of bright light suddenly erupted from the distant mountain! Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

The light swept through the entire mountain forest and a powerful impact swept out in all directions!

It was as if the entire mountain forest had suffered a disaster! The trees were broken, the mountain range collapsed, and the wild beasts instantly turned into dry bones!

“What’s going on? How can there be such a powerful force?” Tang Mo and the others’ expressions couldn’t help but change!

Even Tang Sheng frowned.

Although all of them were in the Martial Marquis realm, they still felt a strong sense of oppression.

“Is this force really coming from Qin Yu’s body?” Tang Mo exclaimed in alarm.

The man with the mustache on the side said in a deep voice, “There’s such a sense of oppression even from far away. If we get close... I’m afraid we’ll be crushed into mud! Is this the reason why Qin Yu won’t let us get close?”
