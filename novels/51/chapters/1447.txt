Chapter 1448: Chapter 1,448, Mr. Yongji 1

After that, Qin Yu, Jue Wu, and the others left this place. They went to the nearest city and found a tavern, intending to get drunk.

As for the Great Elder, he was lying on the ground, on the verge of death. He looked extremely miserable.

The surrounding people quickly surrounded him.

They couldn’t help but sigh when they saw the great elder lying on the ground.

“This first elder is really miserable. He didn’t complete the mission, but the divine lamp was stolen by someone else.”

“There’s nothing we can do. It’s his fault for encountering the unique dance.”

“I don’t know why, but I feel pity for this first elder.”

Then, a warm-hearted person sent the first elder to the pharmacy. After the emergency treatment, he was sent back to the Heavenly Cloud sect.

After experiencing this battle, the first elder’s reputation was completely tarnished.

His miserable state had been spread around the southern province for a long time.

...

In the pub, Qin Yu, Jue Wu, and Wen Da were playing with their fists while drinking.

With such a drinking method, Zhuo Jing naturally didn’t fit in.

He sat at the side, looking a little lonely.

“Zhuo Jing, come with us. It’s quite fun.”Qin Yu looked at Zhuo Jing.

Zhuo Jing smiled bitterly and said, “I’m not interested in this. You guys have fun.”

Qin Yu spread out his hands. He also knew that Zhuo Jing was the descendant of the Wen family, so it would be difficult for him to fit in at such an occasion.

After a round of drinking, the Wen brothers, who were the weakest among them, were the first to be unable to hold on.

And Qin Yu, who had recovered his spiritual power, could be said to have a huge amount. Even Jue Wu could not drink anymore.

“No, no, no, I Won’t drink anymore. If I drink anymore, I’ll throw up.”Jue Wu kept waving her hand.

Seeing this, Qin Yu also put down the wine glass in her hand.

“Jue Wu, did you break through?”Qin Yu asked casually.

Jue Wu said proudly, “Of course!”

“What realm did you break through to? The return to Void Realm?”Qin Yu asked curiously.

The scene of her grasping the divine lamp with her bare hands shocked Qin Yu greatly, so she couldn’t help but doubt Jue Wu’s strength.

Jue Wu glared at Qin Yu and said, “It’s none of your business. I Won’t tell you.”

Qin Yu rolled her eyes at her and didn’t say anything more.

“Brother Qin, what are your plans next?”Zhuo Jing asked from the side.

Qin Yu said in a deep voice, “Cultivate first. Let’s talk about it after I recover my spiritual power.”

“Closed-door cultivation?”Zhuo Jing asked.

Qin Yu nodded and then said, “Brother Zhuo, do you have any excellent cultivation places?”

“Let’s go to my house. I have a lot of medicinal herbs in my house. I should be able to help you,”Zhuo Jing said.

Qin Yu hurriedly waved his hand and said, “No, I already owe you enough. If you really want to help me, recommend a good place for cultivation.”

Seeing this, Zhuo Jing didn’t continue to be stubborn.

He thought for a moment and said, “If it’s a good place for cultivation, it should be occupied by the big families of the South Province and these big shots.”

As he spoke, Zhuo Jing deliberately glanced at Jue Wu.

Qin Yu immediately understood Zhuo Jing’s meaning.

He smiled and said, “Okay, then I understand. I’ll go to Mount Hua Ning in a while.”

“I didn’t agree,”Jue Wu said with her eyes wide open.

Qin Yu smiled and said, “Whether you agree or not, I have to go.”

“Don’t you dare!”Jue Wu slapped the table and stood up. The table was instantly smashed into pieces.

Meanwhile, Wen Da Wen er, who was sleeping on the table, also fell to the ground.

“Forget it if you don’t let me go. I’m Not Going,”Qin Yu snorted lightly.

“There are many places in the world for cultivation. Do you think I have to go to Mount Hua Ning?”

When Jue Wu heard this, she coughed dryly and said, “Forget it. Since you’re begging me, I’ll agree to it.”

“I’m not begging you.”

“You’re begging. They all heard it just now!”

“...”

The group of people stayed in the city for a night.

With Jue Wu around, Qin Yu didn’t worry about her safety, so she slept very comfortably.

The next day, they set off for Mount Hua Ning.

At Qin Yu’s request, Zhuo Jing followed them to Mount Hua Ning.

Jue Wu was quite generous. After arriving at Mount Hua Ning, she directly gave her cultivation room to Qin Yu.

Of course, Qin Yu didn’t stand on ceremony.

He came all the way to Jue Wu’s cultivation room and sat down.

This cultivation room was located on the peak of the mountain. Sitting here, he was already shoulder to shoulder with Yun.

Just as Qin Yu was about to cultivate, Jue Wu’s two attendants suddenly ran over.

“Lord Jue Wu, there’s someone at the foot of the mountain who wants to see you,”said the attendant. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“Who is it?”Jue Wu asked curiously.

The two attendants said, “It’s Mr. Yong Ji from the Eternal City.”

Upon hearing this, Jue Wu frowned slightly.

“Why is he here?”Jue Wu whispered.

Qin Yu couldn’t help but open his eyes.

Mr. Yong Ji? Was it that Mr. Yong Ji who claimed to have more than a hundred foster sons under him?

Some people had once judged in private that Mr. Yong Ji’s eternal city was no worse than the Heavenly Cloud sect. If he were to rise up and overthrow the Heavenly Cloud sect, it would be very easy, but he was low-key.

There were also people who said that he was a despicable person. His heart was extremely dark and hypocritical.

“Qin Yu, help me receive him.”Jue Wu waved her hand and said.

Qin Yu was stunned and said, “Ah? I’ll help you receive him?”

Jue Wu whispered, “I don’t like this person very much. I don’t want to see him.”
