2136 The Purpose

The people from the various aristocratic families had long arrived.

Though the place occupied a massive area, it was still crowded with people. Looking around, the people nearly fully occupied the place.

The various aristocratic families brought nearly all their cultivators here. Regardless of whether they had talent in cultivation, they would not miss it.

Qin Yu could not help but frown slightly. He understood that everyone could participate in the day of the Path of Heaven depending on their talents.

However, due to the dominance of the various aristocratic families, they had forcefully made this place where the Path of Heaven descended into something exclusive to them.

Before the day of the Path of Heaven arrived, numerous affluent families’ children even secured their qualifications to enter this place by leveraging various connections.

Qin Yu did not say anything, but his heart was full of disdain.

“Mr. Qin, you’re also here indeed.”

At this moment, Saintess Gu walked over.

Qin Yu was not surprised to see Saintess Gu. He nodded slightly and said, “Such a good thing can’t just benefit your nine great aristocratic families.”

Saintess Gu certainly could sense the dissatisfaction in Qin Yu’s tone, but she did not express much. She only smiled and said, “In this great world, everyone naturally considers what is beneficial to themselves.”

At this point, Saintess Gu changed the topic and continued, “The people from the Si family and the Yao family have arrived. If they see you, I’m afraid they will…”

“Since I dare to come, I’m naturally not afraid of them.” Qin Yu snorted.

As expected, speaking of the devil, Si Liuhe stepped into the air and arrived.

He stood in front of Qin Yu with a cold expression.

His tremendously powerful internal qi had caused his dao techniques to become somewhat disordered.

“Si Liuhe.” Qin Yu spoke first.

Si Liuhe’s face turned cold, and he said coldly, “You’re truly uncultured. I’m at least your senior. How can you call me by my name?”

“The Si family and I have long been in an irreconcilable conflict. What’s the point of saying all this nonsense? I know you want the Traceless Immortal Scripture, but I’m telling you now. Don’t even think about it!” Qin Yu berated coldly.

It seemed that no one expected Qin Yu to be so stubborn. Even Si Liuhe was slightly startled.

“Looks like you know your death is imminent.” But soon, Si Liuhe’s expression eased.

“If you could kill me, you would have done it long ago,” Qin Yu sneered and said.

He seemed to feel that bickering with Qin Yu was a little demeaning, so he did not say anything else and turned to leave.

“I, Qin Yu, will relentlessly fight with your Si family!” Qin Yu shouted from behind!

The Si family kidnapped Chang Mang, and Xiao Hai’s fate was unknown now. There was no slightest chance of reconciliation between them.

Hearing Qin Yu’s words, Si Liuhe stopped in his tracks.

Turning around, he said indifferently, “Oh yes, my Si family and the Yan family will get engaged on the day of the Path of Heaven. You have to witness the engagement personally.”

After saying this, he turned around and left.

Soon, many people present discovered Qin Yu’s tracks.

Teng Zixu, Yao Xi, and the others all turned to look at Qin Yu. Numerous chilling killing intents were heading straight for Qin Yu, but they did not say anything and get closer to him.

“Qin Yu!

At this moment, Holy Son Jiang looked like he had seen something extraordinary. After shouting, he quickly walked up to Qin Yu. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“Hurry up! Return the tribulation magical artifact of my Jiang family,” Holy Son Jiang urged.

Qin Yu glanced at him and said, “Don’t worry, I’ll return it to you, but now is not the time.”

“Not the time? Why are you keeping it? You won’t live for long anyway,” Holy Son Jiang muttered.

When Qin Yu heard this, he could not help but snort lightly and say, “It seems that Holy Son Jiang is certain that I’ll die today.”

“Sigh! I can’t tell that it’s today. Anyway, once this matter is over, all the great aristocratic families will definitely swarm over. No one can protect you. If I were you, I would find a chance to escape right now,” Holy Son Jiang muttered.

“Don’t worry, Holy Son Jiang. I’ll definitely return the tribulation magical artifact to you before I die.” Qin Yu smiled faintly.

“Alright, it’s settled then. You can’t give that tribulation magical artifact to anyone else,” Holy Son Jiang muttered.

With that, he walked to the side and began comprehending the dao technique. He wanted to gain a hint of comprehension on the day of the Path of Heaven.

“Mr. Qin, I don’t quite understand. You clearly know this is a deadly situation, so why must you come? Could it be that you think Dean Lei can protect you?” Saintess Gu spoke out her doubt.

“Or do you think you can break through to the True Saint Realm on the day of the Path of Heaven and fight against everyone?”

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “Of course not. It takes years of accumulation to break through to the True Saint Realm. It’s the accumulation of various aspects. It’s impossible to step into the True Saint Realm with just the day of the Path of Heaven. Even the Holy Sons can’t do it, not to mention me.”

“In that case, are you here for Yan Ruoxue and Si Shiyue?” Saintess Gu was even more surprised.

Qin Yu was silent because what Saintess Gu said was right.

The reason Qin Yu risked his life coming to the day of the Path of Heaven was to bring Yan Ruoxue away.

Qin Yu had made all the necessary preparations. He would immediately leave this place as long as he could find Yan Ruoxue.

Even if this move might lead to eternal damnation, Qin Yu still had to try.

“Saintess Gu, you should go and comprehend the dao technique. After all, the day of the Path of Heaven is a rare sight. There’s no need to waste time on a dead man,” Qin Yu said indifferently.

“Mr. Qin is asking me to leave,” Saintess Gu sighed with emotion and said.

Qin Yu did not say anything else. He simply sat cross-legged and closed his eyes.

Seeing this, Saintess Gu did not insist on pursuing it further. She turned around and walked away.

At this moment, Qin Yu was releasing his divine sense to search for Yan Ruoxue.

Unfortunately, the dao technique on the day of the Path of Heaven was complicated and intricate. Moreover, many True Saints were in this place which caused the divine sense in the void to be so confusing. It was impossible to find anything.

Qin Yu frowned. He slowly stood up, and his eyes swept around.

In the next moment, he activated his divine eye and wanted to look for her one by one.

“As long as I can find the gathering place of the Yan family’s cultivators, I can find Yan Ruoxue,” Qin Yu thought to herself.

At this moment, a cultivator by the side suddenly walked past Qin Yu and knocked hard on him.

This person covered his face, and Qin Yu could not pry into his internal qi. After knocking Qin Yu, he did not say a word and quickly left.

Qin Yu frowned slightly. He looked down and saw a piece of paper on the ground.

Qin Yu did not have time to think. He hurriedly picked up the note.

He opened it and saw a line of exquisitely beautiful handwriting on it. “I’ll find an opportunity to look for you. Don’t wander around.”
