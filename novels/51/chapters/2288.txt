2289 Seeing Hei Yu Again

“That’s right. We can’t accept what you said! It’s the foundation for our Yun family to rise again.”

Another elderly man sternly rebuked.

“Yun Tian, you’re bullsh*tting! Where were you guys when I fought for resources for the entire Yun family? Furthermore, Father and I fought and snatched back the three Green Spirit Trees at the cost of nearly losing our lives. What do they have to do with you?”

Yun Tian pointed at two of them and scolded them angrily.

“Outrageous! Disrespectful and insolent! As the highest-seniority member of the Yun family, I hereby declare that from this moment onward, you are unworthy of being the head of our Yun family!”

The elderly man pointed at Yun Lin and said.

“Agreed!”

Another person immediately chimed in.

“F*ck, you’re shameless to this extent. I, Qin Yu, have seen countless shameless people since I started cultivating, but you guys can be ranked the top few!”

Qin Yu was dumbstruck.

“Mr. Qin, Yun Lin is a little muddled-head now. Judging from your appearance, you should be from a great aristocratic family. You wouldn’t do anything to steal someone’s foundation. Otherwise, it won’t do good for Mr. Qin’s reputation and the reputation of the family behind you if word gets out.”

Yun Tian bowed and said to Qin Yu.

The other elderly man, Yun Er, was about to stretch out to snatch the three Green Spirit Trees in Yun Lin’s hands.

“Get lost!”

Yun Lin was so exasperated that he spat out a mouthful of blood.

“Give it to me. You’re ungrateful!”

A vicious expression flashed across Yun Er’s face. He pretended to support Yun Li but actually used a hidden force to attack him fiercely.

“Crunch!”

His hand was grabbed by Qin Yu. Qin Yu exerted a little force and instantly crushed his fist into pieces.

“Ah!”

Yun Er screamed in agony.

“What do you mean?”

Yun Tian looked unsure and asked.

“Nothing much. I just realized that you guys are the same as Hua Tian. You should all die!”

He directly smashed Yu Er’s head with a palm strike.

Yun Tian was stunned on the spot as if he dared not believe Qin Yu would suddenly attack and kill someone. Seeing Qin Yu walk step by step toward him, only at this moment did he think of begging for mercy.

“Do I look too friendly?”

Qin Yu asked with a smile.

“Yes, yes, yes!”

Yun Tian nodded hurriedly.

“Snap!”

Qin Yu directly blasted his head into fragments.

“I apologize for the embarrassment. This is the family that our ancestors worked tirelessly to build over three generations.”

Yun Lin seemed to have aged a lot all of a sudden. He handed the three Green Spirit Trees to Qin Yu and staggered away.

“Let him be. There’s no need to chase after someone whose heart is dead. Perhaps for him, it’s an opportunity for a fresh start after breaking apart.”

The man with the mustache’s voice suddenly sounded.

Recently, he had been studying the coffin even without eating. He did not expect to be attracted by what happened here.

“Haven’t you been studying the masked woman’s coffin? Has it been any progress?”

Qin Yu’s divine sense entered the Sumeru ring. He was instantly furious when he saw what happened inside.

At this moment, attracted by Yun Qingyun entering the Sumeru ring, the man with the mustache was taking Yun Qingyun’s pulse seriously. His appearance was even more disheveled after several months without trimming his beard and hair.

A massive thunderbolt struck down, turning the man with the mustache’s skin into charcoal.

“F*ck, Qin Yu, are you killing me?”

The man with the mustache rolled on the ground in pain.

“Xiaoru, Little Fatty, pull off the wretched uncle’s beard!”

“Alright!”

Xiaoru and Little Fatty laughed as they ran toward the man with the mustache.

…

Qin Yu retracted his divine sense after settling the matter in the Sumeru ring.

At this moment, the remaining Lin family members stood trembling and dared not leave. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“Mr. Qin, we don’t have any blood relations with these two people. Please don’t vent your anger on us.”

A young man with dyed red hair and a head of explosive hair was shivering.

“You may go. It has nothing to do with you all.”

Qin Yu waved his hand and let them leave on their own. These people had also clamored earlier. However, Qin Yu was not the kind of murderous demon, so he did not care about them.

“Great! Mr. Qin was righteous. These two old farts deserved to die!”

The young man said happily, and the group hurriedly ran away.

“Excuse me, are you Senior Qin Yu?”

When Qin Yu was the only one left, an onlooking youth mustered up his courage and asked.

“Hmm? Who are you?”

Qin Yu asked curiously.

“It’s you, as expected. Hei Yu is my foster father. He told me about you before. I saw them address you as Mr. Qin just now, and it’s really you.”

The young man said somewhat excitedly.

“Bring me to see Master Hei Yu.”

Qin Yu recalled Master Hei Yu, whom he had met on the Fire Unicorn Continent. He did not expect to meet his foster son here.

“Kid, what’s your name? Why are you here?”

“My name is Hei Lianfeng. Mr. Qin can call me Xiao Feng. My foster father and I have been living on the Heavenly Origin Continent. The Heavenly Origin Continent was in chaos some time ago, and the commotion only stopped today. I thus came out to take a peek. Mr. Qin is really amazing that you killed all those bad people!”

Xiao Feng clenched his fist and looked at him with admiration.

Qin Yu patted Xiao Feng’s head. A child’s world was very simple. There were only good and bad people.

In less than half a day, the two arrived at a bamboo forest.

“Brat, where did you go? I’ll beat you to death!”

Hei Yu rushed out in a flurry and grabbed Xiao Feng’s ear with one hand.

“It hurts! It hurts! Dad, let go. There’s a guest!”

Xiao Feng screamed.

“Who are you?”

Only at this moment did Hei Yu notice Qin Yu at the side. He pulled Xiao Feng behind him with some vigilance.

“Dad, isn’t this Senior Qin Yu you mentioned to me before? He’s so powerful that he beat up all those bad guys!”

Xiao Feng stuck his head out and said loudly.

“Oh, oh! It’s you, Mr. Qin! Esteemed guest, hahaha! Come in and have a cup of tea!”

After carefully examining Qin Yu’s face, only then did he confirm.

“Hurry up, Brat, go boil some water. Mr. Qin saved your father’s life, or else you would be an orphan now.”

Hei Yu kicked Xiao Feng.

“Haha, Master Hei Yu, your family’s atmosphere is not bad.”

Qin Yu could not help but laugh when he saw Xiao Feng run out.

“Hope you don’t mind. This child has a bitter life. His parents were killed by enemies in purgatory. I had the opportunity of forging weapons with his parents before, so I brought him along with me. The world is getting increasingly chaotic these days.”

Hei Yu shook his head.

“No one can be sure of the Path of Heaven. For example, the outbreak of the Netherworld Mystic Realm this time. I can only increase my strength and protect the people around me.”

Qin Yu smiled bitterly.

“Dad, there ‘re no more tea leaves!” Xiao Feng poked his head in and said.

“How could that be? Where’s the tea I hid under the table? It was something that your father exchanged after risking his life to forge a weapon. It’s in the bottom drawer of the table.”

“Didn’t you want to eat herbal tea eggs yesterday? I used it to cook the herbal tea eggs. Didn’t you praise me for cooking the tasty herbal tea eggs yesterday?”

Xiao Feng said confidently.
