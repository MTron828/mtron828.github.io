Chapter 1329: Chapter 1,329, Light Gold, right fist! 

Qin Yu’s sudden strange action immediately made Wan ‘Er Blush and she hurriedly covered her eyes.

The third shouted, “Qin Yu, what are you doing!”

Qin Yu couldn’t care less about these two people. He carefully observed the changes in his body and turned around in front of the mirror.

But what puzzled Qin Yu was that there was no change in his body at all this time.

“How could this be?”Qin Yu frowned and asked.

He stood there and pondered for a long time before he suddenly thought of something!

“The last time, it was because of the injury on my chest that my new skin and flesh changed. Could it be that... I have to have a new body?”Qin Yu thought to himself.

Thinking of this, Qin Yu looked at his own fist.

“It must be like this,”Qin Yu said coldly.

A trace of fierceness flashed in his eyes. Then, he clenched his left fist, and a monstrous divine power surged out.

In the next second, Qin Yu’s left fist fiercely smashed onto his right fist!

This punch was extremely powerful. Even Qin Yu’s own physical body could not withstand it.

At the instant of the collision, his right fist instantly shattered, and even his bones cracked!

Looking at the bloody right fist, Wan ‘er and AH San were stunned.

“Qin Yu, don’t think too hard. There are still plenty of opportunities!”Ah San said in surprise.

Wan ‘Er didn’t care about being shy. She hurriedly walked forward and said, “Young Master Qin, what... What are you doing?”

However, a smile appeared on Qin Yu’s face.

He lay on the bed and said with a smile, “This should be fine...”

To Qin Yu, the most important thing was his fist.

Therefore, he had to ensure that his right hand would be the first to change!

In this way, Qin Yu was not afraid of Ling Yun at all!

Qin Yu lay limply on the bed. He ignored the pain coming from his palm.

On the other hand, wan ‘Er was in a hurry to Bandage Qin Yu’s wound. Ah San went out to find a pharmacist to treat Qin Yu.

After a period of busyness, Qin Yu’s right hand was bandaged. The pharmacist gave Qin Yu a few more doses of medicine.

“Sir, how long will it take for my hand to recover?”Qin Yu asked.

The pharmacist said, “Five or six days.”

“So Slow.”Qin Yu frowned slightly.

“You don’t have any spirit energy in your body. This is already considered very fast. Don’t be insatiable,”the pharmacist said with some disdain.

Qin Yu wasn’t angry. Instead, he laid on the bed and laughed.

For the next few days, Wan ‘er spent every day in Qin Yu’s room. It could be said that she took good care of him.

This made Ah San, who was already jealous, even more unhappy.

...

On the other side.

Ling Yun had already arrived at Yang City on an extremely powerful flying beast.

His expression was still extremely cold as he looked down on the entire city.

“Is there a need for such a city to exist?”Ling Yun asked coldly.

As someone who loved slaughtering cities, he seemed to have a natural pleasure in killing people.

The attendant beside him also saw through Ling Yun’s intentions and hurriedly said, “Young Master Ling, this is the border with the western ridge. There must be someone guarding this place. This city has a need to exist.”

Ling Yun glanced at him and snorted lightly.

“Are you sure that Qin Yu is here?”Ling Yun asked.

“I don’t know either. He said it himself,”the attendant said softly.

“If he, Qin Yu, isn’t here, I will kill everyone in Yang City!”Ling Yun said with a vicious expression.

The two of them descended in Yang City very quickly.

Ling Yun’s entourage was responsible for gathering information about Qin Yu while Ling Yun watched the people walking around Yang City coldly.

“Too slow, this is too slow.”Ling Yun frowned slightly and quickly lost his patience.

He grabbed his entourage and said coldly, “Pass down the message. Tell Qin Yu to come and see me. If he doesn’t come, I’ll kill him.”

The attendant opened his mouth and wanted to say something, but in the end, he only nodded.

The news was spread very quickly.

Not long after, Qin Yu, who was staying at the Chen family home, heard the news.

A San rushed in anxiously. He said with a flustered expression, “Qin Yu, what’s going on? Why is Ling Yun looking for You?”

Qin Yu frowned slightly. He sat up from the bed and said in a low voice, “He came quite quickly.”

“What do you mean?”Ah San asked.

Qin Yu snorted coldly. “I asked him to come.”

“Young Master Qin, is there any enmity between you and Ling Yun?”Wan ‘er asked in surprise.

Qin Yu said with a sullen face, “An irreconcilable enmity. I must kill him.”

Wan ‘er immediately turned pale with fright. She said in a low voice, “Young Master Qin, that Ling Yun is the Heavenly Cloud Sect’s Babe. Rumor has it that he is the first elder’s closed-door disciple. How... How did you offend him?”

“Because he deserves to die,”Qin Yu said coldly.

He tried to move his fist and realized that the injuries on his fist had not fully recovered.

Qin Yu snorted lightly and directly tore off the gauze.

At this moment, Qin Yu’s right fist had already grown new flesh and skin.

These new flesh and skin were flickering with a faint golden radiance.

“It’s just as I thought.”Qin Yu could not help but laugh coldly.

This new flesh was far more powerful than his original body, and it was even more terrifying!

Therefore, Qin Yu wasn’t afraid of Ling Yun at all.

“Young Master Qin, what are you doing!”Wan ‘er said anxiously.

“Your injuries haven’t recovered yet. How can you fight with Ling Yun?”

Qin Yu was silent for a moment before saying in a low voice, “Then, I can’t let others die because of me.”

Wan ‘er thought for a moment before saying, “How about this? I have met Ling Yun once before, so he might be able to give me some face.”

“Miss Wan ‘er, absolutely not. Rumor has it that Ling Yun has a vicious nature and is vicious in his actions. You must not come into contact with him!”Ah San said anxiously.

Wan ‘er smiled. “It’s alright. If he really wants to fight with me, I might not be afraid of him.”

Then, Wan ‘er looked at Qin Yu and said, “Young Master Qin, you recuperate first. Leave the rest to me.” nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

She turned around and walked out of the room. Ah San wanted to stop her, but he was stopped by Wan ‘Er’s light palm.

Qin Yu wasn’t too worried. With Wan ‘Er’s strength, Ling Yun might not be her match.

At a tea house in Yang City.

Ling Yun was sitting there sipping tea while waiting for Qin Yu.

Very soon, wan ‘er appeared in the teahouse.

She was wearing a muslin outfit and had a smile on her face. She slowly walked over to Ling Yun and sat down.

A cold expression flashed across Ling Yun’s face when he saw Wan ‘Er.

“I don’t know if Young Master Ling still remembers me,”wan ‘er said politely.

Ling Yun looked Wan ‘er up and down and narrowed his eyes. “You Are... Zhao Wan ‘er?”

“Thank you for remembering me, Young Master Ling,”Wan ‘ER said with a faint smile.

Hearing this, Ling Yun couldn’t help but sneer. “I remember that you were poisoned by the Twilight Qi and your spiritual energy disappeared, right?”
