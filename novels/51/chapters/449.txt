Chapter 450: Meng Wuxiong, Get Out Here! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Qin Yu couldn’t wait to obtain the power of a half-step Martial Marquis.

Ever since he became a Inner Strength Grandmaster, Qin Yu’s strength had improved by leaps and bounds.

And the higher the realm, the greater the benefits!

“I really wonder what level I’ll reach after I become a half-step Martial Marquis...” Qin Yu muttered in a low voice.

Then, he strode toward the Meng family’s manor.

...

Those Inner Strength Grandmasters from the Jingdu Martial Arts Association hurriedly took out their phones and called Xia Hang. They also told Xia Hang about this matter.

After Xia Hang learned about it, he couldn’t help but say angrily, “Two pieces of trash! You can’t even get this simple job done. What use do I have for you guys?!”

These two people said with some grievance, “Mr. Xia, I suspect that our intelligence source is wrong. Qin Yu’s divine sense is extremely sensitive. Even though we restrained our internal qi, he still found us.”

The other Inner Strength Grandmaster also hurriedly said, “Yes, no wonder the Hong family would send out ten half-step Martial Marquises. I suggest that our Jingdu Martial Arts Association also send out half-step Martial Marquises to track down Qin Yu.”

Xia Hang was silent.

He also began to feel that something was wrong.

Qin Yu’s actions made him suspicious.

“If it really can’t be done, we have to get rid of Qin Yu as soon as possible,” Xia Hang muttered in a low voice.

Then, he said in a deep voice, “You two can come back first.”

“Yes.” The two of them heaved a sigh of relief.

...

Jingdu, Yan family.

Han Meng sat opposite Yan Sihai and said aloofly, “I’ve already asked Xia Hang to follow Qin Yu and find an opportunity to cripple him!”

“When that time comes, I’ll bring him to the wedding and let my son kill him personally!”

After Yan Sihai heard it, he couldn’t help but laugh.

He looked Han Meng up and down and said with some contempt, “Mr. Han, a nobody like Qin Yu scared you so much? Why, do you have so little confidence in your son?”

Han Meng was stunned, then lamented, “Qin Yu is indeed not as simple as he seems. In a short period of time, he has created too many miracles.”

“Hahahaha!” When Yan Sihai heard this, he laughed out loud.

“Han Meng, he, Qin Yu, is just an ant from the bottom. At most, he is just an ant with a little talent. You’ve seen so few of such people?” Yan Sihai sneered.

“Do you really think that he alone, Qin Yu, can topple our two great aristocratic families?”

Han Meng was instantly dumbfounded.

His attitude was completely different from Yan Sihai’s.

Out of caution, he even wanted to kill Qin Yu as soon as possible.

However, this idea was rejected by Yan Sihai without any hesitation.

“Han Wei is the son-in-law of the Yan family. Why would the son-in-law of the Han family be afraid of Qin Yu?” Yan Sihai sneered.

Han Meng still wanted to say something, but was interrupted by Yan Sihai with a wave of his hand.

“That’s enough. There’s no need to say anything. Everything is under control,” Yan Sihai said indifferently.

Han Meng sighed and didn’t say anything else.

...

The security of the Meng family’s manor was extremely tight.

The two bodyguards were not only Inner Strength Grandmasters, but they also had hunting licenses and gun licenses.

The two of them held a hunting rifle in their hands, and no one dared to come forward.

But today, a young man holding a graceful woman appeared at the door.

“This is the Meng family’s home. You are not allowed to go near,” the two bodyguards said coldly.

Qin Yu ignored them. He glanced at the two of them and said indifferently, “Where is Meng Wuxiong?”

“Who are you?” The bodyguard frowned and asked.

Qin Yu sneered and said, “The one who will kill him.”

The bodyguard’s expression immediately changed. He immediately took out his gun and pointed it at Qin Yu.

“Get lost quickly! Otherwise, don’t blame us for being impolite!” The two of them shouted angrily.

Qin Yu sneered and said, “You’d better go and inform them.”

“You don’t understand that I’m asking you to get lost, do you?” The two of them moved their guns forward again.

Qin Yu raised his eyebrows and said, “Do you think this thing can hurt me?”

“You’re courting death!” The bodyguard flew into a rage and immediately pulled the trigger!

“Bang!”

A loud sound reverberated!

The bullet whizzed past and hit Qin Yu’s chest.

However, the bullet only left a white spot on Qin Yu’s body. It didn’t even scratch his skin.

“You...” this time, the two bodyguards completely panicked!

Qin Yu said coldly, “You’re too brazen.”

Qin Yu immediately waved his large palm and knocked the two of them unconscious.

It wasn’t easy to find a single person in the huge manor.

Even though Qin Yu’s divine sense was extremely powerful, it was still difficult for him to cover the entire manor.

This was because this manor was really too big.

Standing on the open space of the manor, Qin Yu took a deep breath and then roared, “Meng Wuxiong! Get out here!”

The shout that contained spiritual power instantly spread throughout the entire manor!

It reverberated through the huge manor for a long time!

At Water Rhyme Tower, more than ten people were waiting at the door.

On the top floor of the Water Rhyme Tower, there was a young man sitting cross-legged.

His body was burning with a white mist-like internal qi.

Meng Wuxiong was standing beside him while silently smoking.

Suddenly, a loud shout came from outside!

This shout instantly woke He Teng up!

Meng Wuxiong frowned slightly.

“This voice... is Qin Yu!” Meng Wuxiong said coldly.

He Teng opened his eyes and said indifferently, “Qin Yu... actually found this place.”

Meng Wuxiong snorted coldly. “This kid is really arrogant to the extreme! Does he really think that we can’t do anything to him?”

Then, Meng Wuxiong looked at He Teng and said, “Mr. He, let’s join hands and kill this madman together!”

He Teng shook his head and said indifferently, “Now is not the time to make a move. Give me another three days, and I will be able to step into the half-step Martial Marquis Realm!”

“When that time comes, I will kill him like chopping melons and vegetables!” Coldness flashed in He Teng’s eyes.

Meng Wuxiong frowned and said, “Then what should we do? This kid will find us here sooner or later.”

He Teng took a deep breath and said indifferently, “Go and stop him. Remember, no matter what, we can’t let him come to the Water Rhyme Tower. If necessary, we can use the mountain protection artifact I left behind.”

Although Meng Wuxiong was somewhat unwilling, he still nodded and agreed.

“The few of you, follow me!” Meng Wuxiong pointed at the peak Inner Strength Grandmasters in the Water Rhyme Tower and said. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

The eight peak Inner Strength Grandmasters immediately followed behind Meng Wuxiong and walked out of the Water Rhyme Tower.
