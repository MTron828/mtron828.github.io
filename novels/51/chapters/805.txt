Looking at Qin Yu’s mysterious expression, the handlebar mustache became even more curious.

“What are you thinking?”The handlebar mustache asked in puzzlement.

Qin Yu looked at the handlebar mustache and said, “The Jingdu martial arts association is very scary. It’s even scarier than I imagined.”

The handlebar mustache rolled his eyes and said, “Just this? Do you still need to prove this?”

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “Although they are very scary, the power they can use is very little.”

“Although I don’t know what kind of power is restricting them, I can be sure that they absolutely can’t use a martial saint!” Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“In this way, the JINGDU martial arts association is not as scary as I imagined.”

The handlebar mustache touched his chin and said, “The JINGDU martial arts association has existed for so many years. They definitely have a martial saint.”

“But in the past few decades, they have indeed never used a martial saint.”

Qin Yu sneered, “That’s right. So if I were to attack the Jingdu martial arts association, there would be no need for a martial saint to hold down the fort.”

“Attack the Jingdu Martial Arts Association? !”Hearing these words, the mustached man immediately turned pale with fright!

He subconsciously took two steps back and muttered, “You’re really crazy. I have to stay away from you.”

Qin Yu glanced at him and said, “Don’t worry, I won’t do anything to them for a while.”

With Qin Yu’s current strength, it was impossible for him to attack the Jingdu Martial Arts Association.

After all, he still relied on the power of a martial saint. Once the power of a martial saint disappeared, he would still be a fish at the mercy of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association.

“But soon,”Qin Yu muttered in his heart.

At the moment, Qin Yu was only at the late stage of the Martial Marquis Realm. However, he no longer cared about ordinary people at the peak of the Martial Marquis Realm.

As for those half-step martial saints above the peak of the Martial Marquis realm, they were the most terrifying existences.

“Watch this little black carefully. I’m going to make a call,”Qin Yu said.

He got up and walked out of the house. Then, he dialed Ning Kun’s phone number.

The call was quickly picked up. On the other end, Ning Kun said with a smile, “Qin Yu, why did you suddenly call me?”

Qin Yu didn’t say any nonsense and went straight to the point. “I found the location of the secret realm that holds Yan Ruoxue, but I can’t open it now.”

On the other end, Ning Kun was stunned, then he said in surprise, “Are you sure?”

“Yes.”Qin Yu nodded.

“Does your Hong Yi School have a way to open the secret realm?”

On the other end, Ning Kun hurriedly said, “Of course! Our Hong Yi School’s history is much older than their Jingdu Martial Arts Association!”

“Okay, then send people over as soon as possible,”Qin Yu said.

Ning Kun quickly agreed, and then asked, “Do you need to send more people?”

“No need,”Qin Yu said.

Ning Kun on the other end agreed, “Okay, I’ll immediately send people to Jingdu! I’ll contact you when I get there.”

Qin Yu grunted and directly hung up the phone.

He took a deep breath and muttered in a low voice, “I’ve finally waited for this day.”

On the other side.

After Ning Kun hung up the phone, he was instantly overjoyed!

He hurriedly ran back to the secret realm and came all the way to a certain room.

In the room, a man dressed in a black robe was sitting upright.

After Ning Kun entered the room, he said excitedly, “Sir, Qin Yu found the location of Yan Ruoxue’s Mystic Realm.”

The black-robed man raised his head and looked at Ning Kun.

He narrowed his eyes slightly and said coldly, “Really?”

“Absolutely!”Ning Kun said excitedly.

When the black robed man heard that, he slowly stood up.

With his hands behind his back, he said softly: “We have finally waited for this day. As long as we can obtain Yan Ruoxue, our Hong clan will once again be glorious!”

Ning Kun also said with some longing: “The Hong Clan has been waiting patiently for so many years, and it has finally come to this day!”

The black robed man was silent for a moment, before he turned to look at Ning Kun and said: “I will send someone to Jingdu to contact Qin Yu.”

“At the same time, I will deploy the members of the fire country to set up an ambush in the vicinity.”Pyro said

“As long as we bring the person out, they will immediately bring Yan Ruoxue out of the fire country!”

Ning Kun quickly nodded and said: “Alright!”

... . .

The next day.

Qin Yu sat in this extremely simple and crude room, waiting for news from Ning Kun.

At that moment, little black, who was lying on the ground, struggled to open its eyes.

This slight sound did not escape Qin Yu’s ears.

“TSK TSK, as expected of a demon beast at the peak of the Earth rank. It actually woke up so quickly,”Qin Yu said indifferently.

Blackie looked at Qin Yu coldly and said through gritted teeth, “Qin Yu, I Will F * cking not let you off...”

Qin Yu sneered, “Save your strength. You are not my match at all.”

Blackie struggled to get up, but he couldn’t.

“Lie here obediently. As long as Granny Qin is obedient, I promise I won’t Hurt You,”Qin Yu said with a faint smile.

“If you dare to hurt Granny Qin, I’ll definitely not let you off! ! !”Blackie said angrily.

“TSK tsk, your relationship is really deep.”Qin Yu curled his lips.

Just as Blackie was about to say something, Qin Yu’s phone suddenly rang.

He picked up the phone and walked to the side.

After the call was connected, an unfamiliar voice came from the other side.

“Is it Qin Yu?”The other party asked coldly.

Qin Yu grunted in gratitude.

The other party continued, “I am Zheng Ke from the Hong family. I will arrive at Jingdu Airport in two hours.”

“Got it,”Qin Yu answered and hung up the phone.

He touched his chin and said in a low voice, “You’re pretty fast...”

After making the call, Qin Yu turned around and returned to his room.

He squatted in front of Blackie and said, “Don’t worry. I Won’t hurt you. I just have a few questions to ask you.”

Blackie snorted and immediately turned his head to the side.

Qin Yu continued, “As a Demon Beast, you should know where the Demon Beast will appear, right? Tell me the location.”

“Also, I need a spiritual pill.”

Blackie grinned and sneered, “Do you think I will tell you?”

Qin Yu spread his hands and said, “You will tell me. I don’t have time to deal with you for now. Wait for me to come back and ask slowly.”

After that, Qin Yu gave a few words to the handlebar mustache before rushing to the airport.

Two hours later.

Zheng Ke sent a message to Qin Yu: exit number three.

Qin Yu put his phone away and walked towards exit number three.

A few minutes later, a group of passengers walked out of exit number three.

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and his gaze fell on a young man dressed in black.

The young man also looked at Qin Yu at the same time.
