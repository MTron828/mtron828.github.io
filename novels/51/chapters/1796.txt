1797 The Crimson Moon Continent

Qin Yu did not panic at all after hearing what Xiaobai said. Instead, he was pleasantly surprised.

“Will we get more points then?” he asked excitedly.

“It is life-threatening, ” Xiaobai was slightly surprised and said. “Didn’t you see there were very few people here today?”

Qin Yu couldn’t be bothered with all this. He said anxiously, “Just tell me how many points I can get this time.”

Seeing this, Xiaobai gave up persuading him. He counted and said, “It should be around 15 points.”

!!

“15 points…” Qin Yu murmured.

Adding up Jue Wu’s points, both of them would get a full 30 points!

“If there are two such missions, then my points will be enough to exchange for the Meridian Circulation Technique,” thought Qin Yu.

Qin Yu planned to retreat once he obtained the points. And with the help of the Huangji Buddha Flame, he would strive to enter the Reversion Void Stage in one go!

“Many thanks,” Qin Yu said excitedly to Xiaobai thinking of this.

He then pulled Jue Wu and ran to the entrance of the cave abode to wait quietly.

Seeing this, Xiaobai could not help but mutter, “This kid! It seems like I’m just talking nonsense.

…

After about half an hour, the door slowly opened.

Qin Yu and Jue Wu took the lead and rushed in. They glanced at the missions and immediately locked their eyes on the one with the highest points.

This mission was to go to the Crimson Moon Continent, and they could earn a total of 23 points. Adding up the points, the two of them would earn 46 points!

The Crimson Moon Continent was one of the plates of the Holy Region.

The entire Holy Region was divided into seven major plates.

Zhongzhou, Lizhou, and the Crimson Moon Continent were all parts of them.

The Crimson Moon Continent was the most unique place. Rumor had it that this place was extremely hot, but the area was extremely large. It could be said to be a separate continent, so it was called the Crimson Moon Continent.

As for the target of the mission, Qin Yu didn’t even have time to look at it before he accepted it.

After receiving the mission, Qin Yu and Jue Wu walked out excitedly.

“So long we complete another mission after this, we’ll then have sufficient points, right?” said Jue Wu.

Qin Yu nodded and said with anticipation, “In that case, it won’t take too much time.”

At this moment, the people beside them walked over.

“You guys are quite bold to choose to go to the Crimson Moon Continent,” they said jokingly.

“What’s wrong with that?” Qin Yu looked at him and asked.

“The danger of the Crimson Moon Continent is no less than Zhongzhou,” the other party smiled and said.

“You’re really striving.”

After saying this, he walked away.

Qin Yu could not help but frown. He took a look at the mission and found there was nothing special about it. It also required him to kill a person, and the person was only at the Reversion Void stage.

“That’s weird. Why are they so nervous?” Qin Yu said in a low voice.

Xiaobai, who was still around, walked over. He took a look at Qin Yu’s mission and immediately patted him on the shoulder. He said, “Good luck to you.”

Qin Yu quickly stopped him and said, “Xiaobai, what does this mean? What’s in the Crimson Moon Continent?”

“There are six Forbidden Zones in the Crimson Moon Continent,” Xiaobai said. Rumor has it that even True Saints will die on the spot if they enter the place.”

At this point, Xiaobai looked around making sure no one was around, he then said softly, “Do you know where the rumor came from?”

Qin Yu shook his head, indicating that he had no idea.

“Back then, all the nine great aristocratic families of Zhongzhou sent the True Saints to the Forbidden Zone of the Crimson Moon Continent. Guess what happened?”

Qin Yu didn’t say anything and waited for Xiaobai to continue.

“They all died. Not a single one survived!” Xiaobai said in a deep voice. “Our Thunder Courtyard was also involved. Three True Saints died!”

After hearing these words, Qin Yu’s face instantly turned somewhat ugly.

The power of a True Saint was immeasurable. They could travel through the void even without the help of teleportation formation. They could do anything they pleased in the entire Holy Region.

Rumor had it that the battle among them could even destroy the stars.

However, such an existence didn’t even have the chance to escape from the Forbidden Zone!

“What exactly is in this Forbidden Zone?” Qin Yu said with a frown.

Xiaobai spread his hands and said, “I don’t know because everyone who went in died. Anyway, the nine great aristocratic families have since made the six Forbidden Zones and the depths of the Azure Rock Forest the most dangerous places in the Holy Region.”

Qin Yu was silent, but he suddenly felt cold sweat running down his back.

At this point, Jue Wu muttered, “That’s not right. We’re going to the Crimson Moon Continent, not the Forbidden Zone. How dangerous that place is has nothing to do with us.”

Hearing this, Qin Yu also came back to his senses. He nodded and said, “That’s right. What doe the Forbidden Zone have to do with the Crimson Moon Continent?” Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“Although these people have never entered the Forbidden Zone, they have picked up many good things around it,” Xiaobai said with emotion.

Xiaobai then pointed at the man on Qin Yu’s mission list with his chin and said, “Who can guarantee that he didn’t pick up a Saint Weapon from the Forbidden Zone? Or the inheritance of a True Saint?”

Qin Yu’s face instantly turned a little ugly.

If they encountered a Saint Weapon, they would probably die without even knowing how it happened.

“It shouldn’t be. If there’s a Saint Weapon, why is the point so low…” Qin Yu muttered.

“Who would wear a Saint Weapon on their belts every day?” Xiao Bai sneered and said. “Who would be willing to take out such a treasure unless it was a life and death situation? Thunder Courtyard also has no idea if they have any Saint Weapon.”

Hearing Xiaobai’s words, Qin Yu began to think of backing off.

He glanced at Jue Wu and said, “Why don’t we cancel the mission? Life is more important.”

“Back off? Once you accept it, you can’t cancel it,” Xiaobai said indifferently.

“What’s there to be afraid ? Don’t worry. With me around, nothing will happen!” Jue Wu patted Qin Yu’s shoulder.

Xiaobai poured cold water on them at this point. He said, “Zhongzhou is dangerous because there are many powerful families, and it’s easy to offend the big shots there. However, the death rate in the Crimson Moon Continent is the highest.”

“Let me put it this way. Less than 10% of those who have gone to the Crimson Moon Continent have returned alive.”

Qin Yu smiled bitterly after hearing what Xiaobai said.

He had been blinded by excitement, and now he had no way out.

“Who cares? I believe I’m the chosen one!” Jue Wu said excitedly.

Qin Yu sighed. Since he had already accepted the mission, he could only go for it. At most, he would give up the mission if he encountered danger.

“Don’t overthink. Didn’t Xioabai say that the aboriginal peoples can pick up treasures around the Forbidden Zone? Maybe we can do it too!” Jue Wu said excitedly.

Jue Wu seemed to be fearless. No matter what she encountered, she always looked relaxed.

Under the lead of Jue Wu, Qin Yu also gained confidence.
