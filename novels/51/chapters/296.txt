Chapter 297: Your Opponent Is Me Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

This sea of lightning almost enveloped Qin Yu!

Looking at this shocking scene, everyone couldn’t help but gasp.

“This... the heavens want Qin Yu to die...” Gu Taichu’s expression was solemn.

Chi Feng, who wasn’t far away, laughed out loud. “It’s impossible for him to survive this kind of Heavenly Tribulation! Moreover, Qin Yu is already heavily injured, so he will definitely die!”

Everyone was silent, but their expressions were solemn.

In the dark, Dong Tianhai was also secretly watching.

“Hmph, Qin Yu is dead meat for sure,” Dong Tianhai said coldly.

If Qin Yu died, he didn’t need to hand over the herbs anymore.

“Let’s go. No one can survive this kind of Heavenly Tribulation,” Dong Tianhai said indifferently with his hands behind his back.

On the battlefield, Chi Feng’s eyes were looking at Gu Taichu.

He had a strong murderous aura that was approaching Gu Taichu!

“It’s your turn now,” Chi Feng said with a cold smile.

Gu Taichu looked calm. He raised his head to look at Chi Feng and said slowly, “Even if you don’t do anything, I won’t back down just to survive. Bring it on!”

Chi Feng sneered. “Alright. After I kill you, I’ll set up a tombstone to commemorate you!”

With that said, Chi Feng’s internal qi soared and he instantly charged at Gu Taichu!

Gu Taichu naturally didn’t dare to be negligent. He used the same move to confront Chi Feng!

The two sides engaged in a fierce collision in midair. Explosions could be heard from time to time.

Yao Qing was impatient, but under such circumstances, he couldn’t help at all!

“Mr. Qin, you must hold on...” Yao Qing looked in Qin Yu’s direction and couldn’t help but clench his fists.

In the sea of lightning, Qin Yu’s body was almost burnt, and his entire body turned black.

Even his bones were slowly breaking.

Qin Yu’s consciousness didn’t completely disappear. There was still a ray of light in his mind.

Feeling this excruciating pain, Qin Yu couldn’t bear it any longer.

The golden light in his mind slowly dimmed.

“No... if this goes on... I will really die from this Heavenly Tribulation...” Qin Yu’s divine sense groaned in pain.

The lightning struck his divine sense, and waves of piercing pain almost penetrated Qin Yu’s head.

“I absolutely can’t die here!” Qin Yu sat on the ground, and Yan Ruoxue’s figure flashed in his mind.

This powerful will invigorated Qin Yu.

He endured the Heavenly Tribulation while waiting for the sea of lightning to disappear.

In the air, the battle between Gu Taichu and Chi Feng didn’t stop.

Both sides had used their trump cards to kill each other!

“You really have quite some skills,” Chi Feng said coldly. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Gu Taichu finally had a chance to catch his breath. He didn’t look good, and he looked exhausted.

“Chi Feng, I should have let you die on the road back then. I was really blind!” Gu Taichu’s old face was a bit pale.

However, Chi Feng was ungrateful and sneered. “What’s the point of saying that? I’m going to kill you today! Give me your life!”

The second round of attacks from both sides started again!

Chi Feng had mastered both the Shrinking Ground Into An Inch technique and the Absolute Beginning Sacred Fist technique!

However, the gap between their realms made it extremely difficult for Gu Taichu to win!

He was heavily wounded many times, and his body was covered in blood.

Boom!

Chi Feng clenched his scorching fist and smashed it on Gu Taichu’s body from midair!

Gu Taichu was smashed into the ground instantly. His bones were broken in many places, and he was in extreme pain!

“Master Gu!” Yao Qing hurried to Gu Taichu and tried to pull him out.

However, before he could make a move, Chi Feng sent him flying with a strike!

“Gu Taichu, you and I are three realms apart, but you holding on for so long is a big surprise to me,” Chi Feng said coldly.

Gu Taichu forced himself to stand up.

His stooped body trembled slightly, as if he had some difficulty even standing up.

Chi Feng snorted coldly. “You’re not dead yet?”

Gu Taichu didn’t say anything, but cold sweat was dripping down his face.

“Chi Feng has just stepped into the eighth level Inner Strength Grandmaster realm, and he can only display 60% of his strength at most,” Gu Taichu thought inside.

If it was a veteran eighth level Inner Strength Grandmaster, Gu Taichu would have died long ago!

At the level of an Inner Strength Grandmaster, the difference in strength at every small stage was drastic.

Gu Taichu forced himself to rise up and he looked at Chi Feng once again!

Chi Feng narrowed his eyes and said, “I’m already tired of playing with it. You’d better die now.”

After he said that, Chi Feng used the Shrinking Ground Into An Inch technique and instantly appeared in front of Gu Taichu!

His huge fist smashed onto Gu Taichu’s chest!

Under this punch, Gu Taichu’s back immediately shrank, and his internal organs were greatly impacted!

“Master Gu!” Yao Qing’s eyes revealed a fierce gleam. In a moment of desperation, he actually activated his qi energy and charged towards Chi Feng!

However, Yao Qing’s strength was too weak. Before he could even touch Chi Feng, he was once again slapped onto the ground!

The spot where he landed was exactly on Gu Taichu’s side!

Gu Taichu opened his mouth to say something. However, just as he opened his mouth, fresh blood flowed out from the corner of his mouth.

“Hahahaha!” When Chi Feng saw this scene, he couldn’t help but laugh crazily.

“Old b*stard, I’ll come to commemorate you next year on this day.”

Chi Feng’s hands glowed as he condensed a terrifying energy.

“It’s time to end this!” Chi Feng roared and charged toward Gu Taichu!

Boom!

At this moment, a hand reached out and grabbed Chi Feng’s fist!

“Didn’t I say that your opponent is me?” A voice sounded in Chi Feng’s ear!
