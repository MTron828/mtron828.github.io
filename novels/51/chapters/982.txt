Chapter 983: Chapter 983, the sinister Gu Xinghe

“What do you mean?”Qin Yu asked, puzzled.

Tie Dan sneered, “In the long river of history, there have been countless geniuses. All of them are like stars in the sky, but as long as they share the same life with her, they will eventually die at her hands.”

“Remember, it’s every life!”

Qin Yu couldn’t help but frown.

“It’s not as exaggerated as you say, is it?”Qin Yu said with some doubt.

Tie Dan sneered and said, “Believe it or not, every era will have top-notch geniuses that can suppress the same generation, but all the geniuses died at her hands.”

At this point, tie Dan squatted down and continued, “But you are also lucky. As long as she is resurrected, it is usually a big era.”

“Great era? What does that mean?”Qin Yu asked.

Iron egg said, “She has been reborn four times in total, and she has grown up two times in total. And these two times are the most prosperous era in the past ten thousand years.”

“There will be more geniuses in the great era, and the competition will be fiercer. There will be more top-notch talents born.”

Qin Yu didn’t say anything.

Tie Dan sounded like he was telling the truth, and it didn’t seem like he was lying.

Qin Yu continued to ask, “Then do you know what cultivation level this masked woman is at?”

“I don’t know.”Tie Dan shook his head. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“But I can tell you that cultivators at the tribulation stage are the end of their cultivation path. Very few have reached this level.”

“But many have died in her hands.”

Qin Yu curled his lips.

The handlebar mustache, the Sky Blood Rainbow, and the current tie dan seemed to be extremely afraid of the masked woman.

Especially tie Dan.

He was obviously an extremely arrogant person, but the moment he saw the masked woman, he immediately chose to sleep.

But in Qin Yu’s impression, she was clearly a brat who followed behind him.

“I don’t believe that there’s no one stronger than her,”Qin Yu snorted lightly.

Tie Dan waved his hand and said, “If you say ten thousand years ago, then it’s almost a legend. No one has seen it, so there’s no way to verify its authenticity.”

Qin Yu didn’t continue to ask.

He put away the scarlet fire leaf and left the place with the handlebar mustache.

After another day, the two of them still had little to gain.

This couldn’t help but make the handlebar mustache feel a little annoyed.

“If we can’t get the Babe, it means that someone else beat us to it,”the handlebar mustache sighed.

With that, he took out the treasure map in his hand and opened it.

“But we can take a look at this place.”

The mustached man took out the treasure map and started to compare it with the world map to find the location on it.

“We can take a look at this place,”reminded iron egg.

Qin Yu asked, “What? Are there really treasures here?”

“I don’t know, but according to my impression, this place is most likely a battlefield,”tie Dan said.

Qin Yu nodded slightly and said, “Okay, I got it.”

That night.

He Teng continued to move.

That night, several more people died at his hands, and the methods of committing crimes were exactly the same.

The next day, while Qin Yu was strolling with the handlebar mustache, he heard people discussing this matter.

Of course, Qin Yu didn’t think too much about it. After all, it wasn’t uncommon for people to kill in the martial arts world.

Moreover, this was the Hundred Spirits Association, which was looking for treasures. There was a possibility that someone might kill people and steal their goods.

In the next few days.

Qin Yu and the handlebar mustache continued strolling through the Hundred Spirits Association, resting wherever they went.

For five consecutive days.

A total of eighteen people died in the Hundred Spirits Association.

Each of them looked exactly the same before they died. It was a tragic sight.

“What’s going on? Could it be that someone killed them and stole their goods?”

“This method... feels somewhat similar to the sky blood rainbow back then.”

“Impossible. The Sky Blood Rainbow has already been scared out of his wits. How dare he do such a thing again!”

“I saw the murderer with my own eyes. He was wearing a black robe and his internal Qi was extremely sinister!”

The more this matter spread, the more mystical it became. Some people even said that they saw the murderer eating flesh and bones.

“It seems that places with treasures are more dangerous,”Qin Yu said lazily with his hands on the back of his head.

“Who cares? Just Don’t blame us,”the mustache man muttered.

Qin Yu naturally couldn’t be bothered to care about such things.

In a room.

Gu Xinghe’s lips curled into a sneer.

“It’s about time to guide them,”Gu Xinghe said indifferently as he knocked on the table with two fingers.

Then, he looked at long brows and said, “Send someone to spread the word that this method is exactly the same as the spell that Qin Yu used.”

“Yes.”Long brows nodded quickly.

That night, Gu Xinghe called he teng to his room.

“Young Master Gu...”he teng leaned forward slightly.

Gu Xinghe nodded and said, “How is it? is your cultivation going well?”

He Teng licked his lips, squinted his eyes and said, “At this rate, it won’t be long before I can enter the martial saint realm...”

“Hahaha, not bad! You really live up to your reputation as the number one genius of the Central Plains!”Gu Xinghe said with some admiration.

“It’s all thanks to young master Gu’s guidance...”he teng said with a smile.

Gu Xinghe waved his hand. He took out a hat from his pocket and placed it in front of He Teng.

“What’s This?”He Teng asked in confusion.

Gu Xinghe sneered, “This is the hat that Qin Yu wore. Remember, find an opportunity to deliberately reveal a flaw and leave this hat at the scene.”

He Teng narrowed his eyes and sneered, “I got it.”

He took the hat, turned around, and walked out.

After he teng left, Zhai Xing Strode in.

He looked at Gu Xinghe in front of him and said in a low voice, “If you want to kill Qin Yu, I can help you get rid of him now. Why frame him like this?”

Gu Xinghe glanced at Zhai Xing and snorted, “Uncle Zhai Xing, although you are powerful, you don’t know how to run an organization at all!”

“After this period of time, the prestige of the Jingdu martial arts association has been greatly damaged. We urgently need something to prove our worth and take back the hearts of the People!”

Zhai Xing could not help but sneer, “So you create your own enemies and destroy them yourself?”

“That’s right!”Gu Xinghe said faintly.

“This method is the simplest and most effective because those ants usually don’t have the ability to distinguish themselves and rely on others to think.”

“Moreover, Qin Yu’s voice is too loud right now. If we get rid of him without any charges, then the public’s hatred towards the Jingdu martial arts association will probably reach its peak and explode!”
