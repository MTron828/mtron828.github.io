Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Qin Yu’s mind was in a mess. What was this?

Meng Jing, who was in the sea of consciousness, directly stretched out her fist and punched Qin Yu’s divine soul.

Qin Yu’s vision turned black.

At this moment, Meng Jing stood in her original spot. Her face was slightly blushed.

She stood quietly on the spot. Her figure was like the most perfect grade of art in nature.

However, when a freezing energy was emitted, her expression changed again.

She stared at Qin Yu’s dazed body and sighed softly.

“Can he really break through the Nineteenth Prison with the power of the Dao Realm?”

She wasn’t confident, but no one else other than Qin Yu could resist this power in the Endless Mine.

Therefore, she placed her only bet on Qin Yu.

“This child also went in?”

She suddenlv realized that the child beside her had also started to walk around

on the spot like a zombie.

“Strange, the power of the Heavenly Fiend Lone Star corresponds to the Big Dipper of this place. Logically speaking, the Nineteenth Prison couldn’t affect him. Why would he be sucked in?”

Meng Jing’s beautiful face revealed a puzzled expression.

Qin Yu had already appeared in a completely unfamiliar space. He looked around in a daze.

“Is this the Earth?”

He was a little confused. He was very familiar with the house in front of him.

He pushed the door open and walked in. There was a strange sound between a man and a woman in the room.

Qin Yu pushed open the door and saw Su Yan and Zhao Gang entangled in bed.

A wave of extreme anger filled Qin Yu’s mind. Why are you treating me like this?

“Trash! So what if you’re back?”

Zhao Gang kicked Qin Yu away arrogantly.

“Why do I still feel heartache? Shouldn’t I have forgotten about you a long time ago?”

Qin Yu’s expression was ferocious. At this moment, his body was trembling uncontrollably.

“Qin Yu, ignore them. Come with me.”

A soft hand grabbed Qin Yu’s trembling arm and slowly pulled him out.

“Ruoxue, is that you?”

Qin Yu muttered.

“Yes, it’s me. Let’s live here forever.”

Yan Ruoxue leaned on Qin Yu and pulled him away.

After an unknown period, Qin Yu suddenly felt a touch on his lips as if someone had kissed him.

His blank eyes began to fade as if he had suddenly been frightened and shivered.

“What’s wrong with you? Are you unwilling to live here with me?”

Yan Ruoxue’s eyes suddenly turned extremely vicious.

She moved to Qin Yu and pulled off one of his arms. She put it in her mouth and started chewing.

As his arm was torn off, Qin Yu felt as if he had lost something.

“I’m willing.”

Qin Yu was startled. At this moment, Yan Ruoxue’s body exuded an ocean-like soul power. Qin Yu felt that the person in front of him could easily tear him apart at any time.

Qin Yu was walking in a vast open space now, surrounded by dazzling buildings.

These buildings were all familiar as if Qin Yu had lived in these places for a long time.

There were even some places that he couldn’t remember at all. It was as if they were hidden in the deepest parts of his memories, and now they were slowly appearing.

Every time he reached a place, a wave of memories would surge in like an ocean.

There were many ‘people’ around him, and each of them had a look of infatuation on their faces as if they had seen the deepest thing in their memories.

Moreover, there was a person following them. That seemed to be the thing that left the deepest impression on them.

Some were holding a balloon, while others were holding a sword…

Qin Yu glanced around slightly. At this moment, this vast space was densely packed with these human figures.

There were at least millions of them…

Qin Yu gasped. There shouldn’t be so many people below the mine. Could it be that all the people in the Endless Mine were sucked in?

Moreover, Qin Yu felt uneasy when some people’s divine souls began to mutate. Some people’s arms had disappeared, some people’s heads had disappeared, and some people’s bodies had a big hole.

These people continued to walk in a daze. The scene looked peculiar.

“Qin Yu, I’m hungry. Can I give you a bite?”

Yan Ruoxue leaned against Qin Yu gently and bit his face.

A terrifying chewing sound came from her mouth. At this moment, her face had already become extremely distorted.

However, Qin Yu did not dare to resist at all. He felt a powerful divine thought looking down at them in the air.

The person who had appeared out of thin air was also the most profound thing in their memories.

It should have been derived from the Nineteenth Prison and was currently devouring the power of their souls.

Qin Yu did not dare to imagine what kind of extent this person’s soul power would soar to after devouring so many cultivators.

Moreover, the devouring of soul power would be affected in many ways.

This was not an ordinary person’s soul power, but the soul power of millions of cultivators!

At this moment, a ray of light suddenly appeared in the sky.

As the light enveloped the area, everyone in the huge space disappeared. Even the place turned into nothingness.

Qin Yu’s scalp went numb. His position was less than a thousand meters away from the space enveloped by the light just now.

At this moment, he did not know what had happened. He remembered everything that Meng Jing had told him, but the impression of the talisman was completely blank as if he had lost his memory.

“Quickly remember! ”

Qin Yu’s heart was filled with anxiety, but he couldn’t remember no matter how hard he tried to recall.

While Qin Yu was delaying, the huge face in the sky devoured tens of thousands of divine souls again.

The terrifying divine thought in the air became even more terrifying after the two devours. Qin Yu felt that his skin was about to melt.

Don’t rush! Don’t rush! Analyze it properly!

This memory should be his most important memory. He might have been deprived of it after entering this place!

Perhaps it was because the woman next to him had eaten it, or perhaps it was for some other reason.

If he attacked now, he would undoubtedly attract the attention of the person who set up the array. That would lead to death.

Moreover, he might not be a match for the woman. In this world, there seemed to be another kind of rule. When the woman bit him just now, he did not even have the slightest bit of resistance. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Soul Torment Mind Technique!

Qin Yu’s thought suddenly moved. The Ghost Mansion heart mantra had its unique characteristics of soul power cultivation. He wanted to see if he could recover his lost memories.

At this moment, the woman beside Qin Yu was pulling him as they walked slowly. They were both pacing in the same place.

Qin Yu was surrounded by the most familiar scenes. The people around him were the same. They were all immersed in their world..
