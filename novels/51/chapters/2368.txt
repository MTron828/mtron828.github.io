Looking at the slowly retreating army, Qin Yu had a hint of worry on his face.

And this monster race army was only slightly stronger than ordinary people. How could humans resist if they were a little bit stronger?

Currently, the people from the Holy Region only came here to plunder resources everywhere. They did not organize the human cultivators here to form a good defense line.

Moreover, according to his observations, these monster and ghost races were getting stronger each time they appeared.

If this continued, humans would probably fail to resist at all.

Qin Yu entered the Black Platform Continent, and as soon as he entered, he saw cultivators burning, killing, and looting.

The soldiers of the city lord’s mansion had long run off and were nowhere to be found. The powerful cultivators of the various aristocratic families were basically not in the city.

Seeing the monster race army retreat, the remaining people took advantage of the chaos and immediately had their own ulterior motives.

“D*mn it, these opportunistic b*stards! When the monster race army came, they ran faster than anyone else. Now they’ve turned around and attacked their own people. They’re the most ruthless.” 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Chang Mang saw the scene and was instantly enraged. He charged into the crowd and killed dozens of people.

Seeing such an Asura, the chaos gradually calmed down.

“Piao Ruoyun, go and organize these people. At the very least, you have to lead them. Otherwise, the people here will die the next time the alien race invades again.”

Qin Yu hesitated for a moment and spoke to Piao Ruoyun. After she took over the Azure Firmament Sect, she soon restored the order in the sect. Therefore, it should not be a problem for her to lead the cultivators of the Black Platform Continent.

Qin Yu sat cross-legged in the void. A ball of demonic qi he had just collected appeared in his hand.

Jue Wu looked at the demonic qi curiously. She tried to touch the ball of demonic qi with her hand.

“F*ck, this demonic qi is so corrosive. I’m afraid my finger would have melted if I hadn’t used my spiritual energy to protect it just now.”

Jue Wu quickly retracted her finger.

Qin Yu carefully examined this ball of demonic qi. It seemed to be very different from the spiritual energy of human cultivation.

It was completely a different type of spiritual energy. It was a great tonic for the monster race, but fatal poisons for the humans.

Qin Yu tried to draw this ball of demonic qi into his body.

As if sensing the invasion of the alien race’s vital energy, the chaotic vital energy started boiling like boiling water.

“Thump!”

With a dull sound, the two internal qi clashed and caused an explosion.

The demonic qi dissipated within Qin Yu’s body. Jue Wu came over and asked with a nervous expression.

“Are you alright?”

The sound just now was like thunder, and even the ground trembled slightly. It gave the people nearby a shock.

“I’m fine. Fortunately, I’ve completed my Glazed Holy Body cultivation. Otherwise, I would have been injured.”

Qin Yu looked solemn. These two different energies seemed to have been completely incompatible. The moment they came into contact, an explosion that was ten times more ferocious than the clash of spiritual energy erupted.

And it was only the lowest-level monster race army’s demon qi. If it were the general’s higher-level demon qi, wouldn’t the explosion be even more terrifying?

Qin Yu had racing thoughts, but the movements of his hands did not stop at all.

He released a wisp of chaotic power. It clashed with the demonic qi outside the body.

However, the result was just like an ordinary clash of spiritual energy. It did not cause such a big explosion.

Qin Yu could not understand why the two same spiritual energy would be so different when they were inside and outside the body.

It was only a matter of time before the monster race and humans would clash. He thus had to study the monster race as soon as possible.

“Jue Wu, try to infuse a trace of demonic qi into your body and see what happens, but you can only absorb a little.”

Qin Yu carefully segregated a trace of demonic qi in her hand and watched as Jue Wu absorbed it into her body.

However, strangely, nothing happened. Jue Wu soon refined the demonic qi and did not experience the same situation as Qin Yu.

Qin Yu was confused. Was this related to the chaotic body or the Glazed Holy? He could not figure it out either.

In the subsequent few days, Qin Yu was studying this demonic qi.

Under the leadership of Piao Ruoyun, the order in the Black Platform Continent soon stabilized.

Chang Mang broke several powerful cultivators’ legs and threw them out.

Jue Wu, on the other hand, was continuously hunting demonic beasts for food in the vicinity, and she had come to a conclusion.

The demon race tasted the best among the demon, monster, and ghost races.

On this day, just as Qin Yu was immersed in cultivation, a jade talisman suddenly shattered.

Qin Yu frowned, and his body instantly disappeared on the spot.

The Crescent Moon Continent was not far from here. With his current speed, he would arrive at the Crescent Moon Continent very quickly.

At this moment, the place had been filled with demonic qi.

These monsters were the monster race army that had wanted to attack the Black Platform Continent.

Qin Yu’s vast divine sense swept out, only to discover 80% to 90% of the humans here had died.

If the little girl’s village weren’t located in a secluded place, they would have been in trouble by now.

Qin Yu arrived at the village at this moment. A few teams of the monster race had already rushed into the village and started massacring the humans wantonly.

Even though Qin Yu’s soul was powerful now, he was furious that these monsters had mercilessly slaughtered the ordinary people.

He punched out, and the fist qi carried a destructive fluctuation that exploded among several monster teams. The massive shock wave directly blasted the monsters into powder.

Under the Spiritualization Technique…

A protective shield appeared on the villagers’ bodies, protecting them.

“Big brother, it’s you! You really came to save us!”

The little girl’s eyes lit up, and she looked overjoyed.

“Yes, Little Girl, it’s no longer safe here. I’ll take you all to another place.” Qin Yu smiled and patted her head.

The Crescent Moon Continent was a barren land to begin with. Very few cultivators would cultivate there.

If such a space encountered the monster army, the people living inside would die.

“Alright, we’ll leave with you. By the way, Big Brother, can you save a little monk? He lured these bad guys away to save us just now.”

The little girl raised her head and said anxiously.

Qin Yu nodded and placed the little girl and the villagers into the Sumeru ring.

He scanned the area with his divine sense.

An intense battle was going on at the edge of the Crescent Moon Continent. He had discovered something as soon as he arrived at the Crescent Continent, but he was in a hurry to save the little girl and had ignored it.
