Zhou Tong froze. He was actually being arrested?

A few people walked forward and stretched out their hands to arrest Zhou Tong.

But at this time, Zhou Tong shouted, “I’m friends with your boss. Let me give him a call!”

These people weren’t in a hurry. They immediately stood to the side and nodded. “You can make the call.”

Zhou Tong took out his cell phone and made a call.

After the call was connected, Zhou Tong hurriedly said, “Mr. Fang, what’s going on? Why are your people here to arrest me?”

The man called Mr. Fang sneered. “You broke the law. Who should they arrest if not you?”

Zhou Tong’s expression changed again. He said somewhat anxiously, “Mr. Fang, you... what do you mean?!”

“What do I mean? Hehe, Zhou Tong, you’re finished!” After saying that, Mr. Fang hung up the phone.

Zhou Tong immediately felt despair inside. His legs went soft and he fell to the ground with a plop.

The few of them didn’t say anything. They walked forward, grabbed Zhou Tong’s arm and walked out.

The sudden change made the venue completely silent.

The president who was high and mighty not long ago had now become a criminal. It made them feel astonished.

Then, a few people from the Association came in front of Qin Yu.

“Mr. Qin, the higher-ups have decided that you will be the president of the Chinese Medical Association,” the few people said.

Qin Yu scratched his head and said, “Can I not be the president of the Chinese Medical Association?”

When the few people heard this, they couldn’t help but force a smile and say, “Many people have risked their lives to be the president, but you actually refused?”

Qin Yu said helplessly, “I’m used to enjoying freedom. I really don’t want to be under control.”

“Mr. Qin, you’d better tell our director. We are only responsible for passing on the message.” The few of them shook their heads.

After saying this, they left the place.

“Mr. Qin, congratulations on becoming the new President!”

“Should we call you President Qin?”

“President Qin, this is my business card. If you need anything, just let me know!”

Countless people ran over to curry favor with Qin Yu, and their demeanor was extremely servile.

It was very obvious that Qin Yu had underestimated the power of the position of president.

Even though he didn’t belong to any official organization, he had a lot of power.

Then, Qin Yu followed the host backstage.

Backstage, there was a wooden box.

Qin Yu couldn’t wait to take the wooden box. He opened it and saw a 100-year-old Chinese knotweed inside.

“What a strong herbal aroma!” Qin Yu took a deep breath and couldn’t help but feel a little delighted!

With this 100-year-old Chinese knotweed, he might advance to the second level of the Foundation Establishment Stage!

Although the Foundation Establishment Stage was the foundation of cultivation, it was the most crucial step.

Just like building a house, the Foundation Establishment Stage laid the foundation.

If he didn’t get the hang of this step, the path of cultivation in the future would be extremely difficult.

“A hundred-year-old Chinese knotweed can cultivate a Foundation Establishment Pill,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

However, the Foundation Establishment Pill wasn’t like the Qi Gathering Pill, which could help him advance one level. On the contrary, the effect of the Foundation Establishment Pill was different for everyone.

Some people could advance several levels with one pill, while others couldn’t even advance one level with several pills.

After taking the Chinese knotweed, Qin Yu planned to leave.

When he walked to the door, Qin Yu happened to meet Luo Jian.

Luo Jian, with a gloomy and hesitant look on his face, stood at the door. He clenched his fists, and there seemed to be some unwillingness on his face.

“You have much potential.” At this moment, Qin Yu said from behind him. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Luo Jian suddenly turned around and looked at Qin Yu coldly.

Qin Yu continued, “It’s a pity that you accepted the wrong person as your mentor. How about you be my disciple?”

Luo Jian snorted coldly. “Be your disciple? In your dreams! Let me tell you, from tomorrow onwards, I will set out on a journey. I will visit all the top pharmacists! Sooner or later, my achievements will surpass yours!”

Qin Yu, not caring at all, spread his hands out.

“Then I wish you good luck.” Qin Yu was joking with him anyway. It was absolutely impossible for him to really take him as a disciple.

After that, Qin Yu and Mr. Yang returned to the hotel.

On the way back to the hotel, Mr. Yang was extremely excited.

“Mr. Qin, I really didn’t expect your alchemy achievements to be so outstanding!” Mr. Yang exclaimed in awe from the bottom of his heart.

Qin Yu also nodded and said, “To be honest, I didn’t expect it myself.”

Qin Yu didn’t know the level of the spiritual fire at all.

After returning to the hotel, Qin Yu was extremely tired.

On this day, there was an endless stream of people who came to visit Qin Yu.

Among them were the various aristocratic families, martial arts experts, and people who wanted to buy the Nine Dragon Pill.

Qin Yu contemplated for a moment and then said to Mr. Yang, “Mr. Yang, I’ll give this Nine Dragon Pill to you. If anyone wants to get the Nine Dragon Pill, they can exchange it with hundred-year-old herbs.”

Mr. Yang was immediately overjoyed. He took the Nine Dragon Pill and nodded repeatedly. “Thank you, Mr. Qin, for your trust in me!”

Qin Yu, extremely tired, yawned.

Qin Yu had been really tired these few days. The spiritual energy in his body was already extremely depleted, and it would be difficult for him to recover in a short time.

“Mr. Qin, you should go rest.” Seeing this, Mr. Yang said with some heartache.

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “I’m waiting for someone.”

“Waiting for someone?” Mr. Yang froze. “Who?”

“Hong Wu,” Qin Yu said in a deep voice.

Qin Yu didn’t trust Hong Wu at all.

He wasn’t even sure if Hong Wu would send the Ganoderma over.

On the other side, Hong Wu was also waiting.

For the whole day, he didn’t go out. Instead, he sat in the courtyard and waited quietly.

If Qin Yu came to ask for it personally, Hong Wu would give the Ganoderma to Qin Yu.

If Qin Yu didn’t come, Hong Wu wouldn’t give the Ganoderma to Qin Yu.

This was a test. After all, the Ganoderma was 200 years old. No one would be willing to give it away for free.

Time passed, and in the blink of an eye, it was night.

“It seems that Hong Wu won’t come,” Qin Yu stood in front of the window and murmured.

On the other side, Hong Wu couldn’t help but sneer. “I’m right. Qin Yu doesn’t dare to come! Without the Saintly Body Technique, he’s afraid of dying in my hands.”

As soon as he finished his words, a young man ran in from outside.

“Sir!” The young man shouted while running.

Hong Wu glanced at him and asked, “What’s the matter?”

The young man said excitedly, “Sir, it’s fortunate that you didn’t become enemies with Qin Yu. Otherwise, things really would have been troublesome!”

Hong Wu frowned and asked, “What do you mean?”

The young man said in surprise, “Sir, don’t you know? Qin Yu was in the limelight at today’s Chinese Medicine Conference!”

Hong Wu frowned even more and signaled the young man to continue.

The young man said excitedly, “Not only did Qin Yu conjure spiritual fire, but he even conjured blue spiritual fire! He also activated Danyun at today’s Chinese Medicine Conference!”

“That’s Danyun fro God’s sake! I’ve only heard rumors about it, but I’ve never seen it before! How amazing! Just this alchemy technique alone is enough to make all the prominent families value him highly!”
