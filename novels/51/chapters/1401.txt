Chapter 1402: Chapter 1402, the Heavenly Cloud sect dispatched 1

The two of them sped towards the divine capital. This was the only solution Qin Yu could think of.

The divine capital was very far from here. Qin Yu might as well go buy the most expensive flying exotic beast.

Since his identity was already exposed, Qin Yu couldn’t care less.

After spending two days and exhausting two flying exotic beasts to death, the two of them finally arrived at the divine capital.

There was still an extremely strange aura flowing in the divine capital. Qin Yu pushed open the door and quickly walked in.

“I’ll rely on you for the rest,”Qin Yu said to tie Dan.

Tie Dan grunted and said, “Give me the initiative of the body.”

Qin Yu didn’t say any nonsense. He slightly closed his eyes and gave the initiative of the body to tie Dan, while he himself stayed in his mind.

After obtaining the body, tie Dan first shook his arms.

He looked at his own body with extreme satisfaction and said with a hint of pride, “This body is really not bad. If this were mine, wouldn’t it cause a bloody storm in the Holy Region?”

“Enough, stop talking nonsense. We can’t afford to waste any more time,”Qin Yu coldly said.

Tie Dan spread his hands and didn’t say anything else. He immediately began to revive the divine inscriptions in the divine capital.

This was a very complicated project. It could be said that he was physically and mentally exhausted. Even tie Dan would need to spend several days.

On the other side, the few people followed Qin Yu’s request to the Wind Pavilion and released the news.

Very quickly, this news swept through the entire southern province.

And the people from the distant heavenly cloud sect naturally also received this news.

“First Elder, Qin Yu has invited us to the Divine Capital.”Someone walked up to the first elder and bowed.

“Divine Capital?”The first elder raised his brows. “What is that place?”

“I don’t know. I’ve never heard of it,”said the person beside him.

The first elder waved his hand and said, “Go and investigate immediately. As long as we find the location, we will set off immediately!”

“Let us handle such a small matter...”

At this moment, the hemp-robed elder suddenly walked out.

The first elder glanced at him and said, “This matter can not be neglected. I must go personally.”

“It’s just a mere Qin Yu. Why bother the first elder...”the hemp-robed elder continued.

The first elder waved his hand and said, “No need to say anything. I have already made up my mind.”

Seeing this, the hemp-robed elder could only retreat to the side.

With the abilities of the Tianyun sect, it was naturally very easy to find a place.

That afternoon, someone found out the location of the divine capital.

The first elder reported to the sect master. Then, he brought the hemp-robed elder and 300 cavalrymen and headed straight for the divine capital!

At the front was a dragon-headed carriage pulled by three mystical horses. The first elder and the hemp-robed elder were shockingly sitting on it.

Behind them were three hundred heavily armored cavalrymen. On top of the cavalrymen, there was a cold white color.

Such a large formation attracted countless people.

They stared at the vast scene in the sky and sighed. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

On the other side, tie Dan was still reviving the divine inscriptions.

This was an extremely old formation. It was based on capturing the divine inscriptions of heaven and earth. Once it was revived, its power would be boundless.

“If we can completely resurrect this formation, a small heavenly cloud sect isn’t even worth mentioning,”tie Dan said in a low voice.

He wiped the sweat off his forehead and continued to set up the formation.

Time passed day by day. In the blink of an eye, three days had passed.

“How is it? How much longer do we need?”Qin Yu asked.

Tie Dan swept his gaze over and replied, “At least two more days.”

Qin Yu frowned and said, “This speed is too slow. I’m afraid it’s Too Late.”

Tie Dan said in a deep voice, “If you have spiritual power in your body, I might be able to be faster. This is the fastest speed.”

Qin Yu calculated the time in her heart. The Heavenly Cloud sect would probably arrive today and tomorrow.

“As soon as possible.”Qin Yu took a deep breath.

Tie Dan nodded and continued to set up the array.

At this moment, the entire South Province was discussing this matter.

Even Wen Da and Wen Er, who were far away on Mount Hua Ning, heard the news.

“Little girl, how long will it take for Aunt Jue Wu to come out of seclusion?”Wen Da came forward and asked in a low voice.

“Who knows when Lord Jue Wu will come out of seclusion?”The girl shook her head.

“It’s over, it’s over. The Heavenly Cloud sect has already made a move against Qin Yu. If Aunt Jue Wu doesn’t come out of seclusion, Qin Yu will be in trouble.”Big Wen was so anxious that he scratched his ears and cheeks.

“That’s right, that’s right. If it really can’t be done, then wake Aunt Jue Wu up in advance.”Wen Er also said.

“Absolutely not!”The two of them hurriedly shook their heads. “If we wake Aunt Jue Wu up now, it’s very likely that she will go mad.”

Seeing this, the two of them didn’t know how to express their goodwill.

“F * ck, I hope that Qin Yu will be able to overcome this difficulty,”Wen da muttered softly.

Just as tie Dan was rushing to resurrect the divine inscriptions, a thunderous sound came from the sky.

After that, the sky gradually darkened.

Looking Up, it seemed as if there was a huge cloud that blotted out the sky and covered the Sun!

If one looked closely, they would see that it wasn’t a dark cloud at all, but a densely packed crowd!

The leader was the first elder!

The carriage was engraved with characters exclusive to the Heavenly Cloud Sect, and there was a flag that was fluttering in the wind.
