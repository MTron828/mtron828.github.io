Chapter 1269: Chapter 1,269, who exactly are you 

The Spirit Monarch Lion’s hair stood on end, as if it had sensed danger!

“Shut up!”

Qin Yu let out a furious roar, and his spiritual power was fully displayed. It was clearly a pair of fists, but it contained a monstrous power!

“Bang!”

This punch ruthlessly smashed onto the spirit monarch Lion’s nose. That enormous force instantly fractured the spirit monarch Lion’s nose.

Under the external force, its bloody mouth suddenly closed, and its huge head slammed heavily onto the ground!

Guan Zhuang, who was watching from the side, was dumbstruck. His jaw was about to fall off.

Was this F * cking horse still human? A punch shattered the spirit monarch Lion’s jaw?

One had to know that this group of strong men had used countless spells, but they were still unable to break the spirit monarch Lion’s defense!

“This kid... didn’t even use his spiritual energy! This is pure physical strength! !”Guan Zhuang exclaimed.

The Spirit Monarch Lion on the ground had already gotten up. Its mouth and nose were constantly bleeding.

Qin Yu looked at the spirit monarch lion coldly and said, “Your luck ends here.”

However, as the king of Demonic Beasts, the spirit monarch Lion would not give up just like that.

After a furious roar, it came again!

Qin Yu seized this opportunity and immediately jumped onto the back of the Spirit Monarch Lion.

Compared to the Spirit Monarch Lion, Qin Yu was the size of a flea and could not be felt on its body.

“Qin Yu, be careful of its fur!”At this moment, Guan Zhuang suddenly reminded.

As expected, all the fur on the back of the Spirit Monarch Lion suddenly swept over.

He originally thought that it would explode with sharp spikes, but unexpectedly, these hairs were incomparably soft, directly wrapping around Qin Yu’s four limbs.

“Is that all you have?”Qin Yu snorted coldly. His body shook violently, instantly shattering the hair!

In the next second, Qin Yu jumped onto the spirit monarch Lion’s head.

He grabbed the spirit monarch lion’s hair with one hand to stabilize his body.

His other hand clenched into a fist as surging divine power continuously smashed towards the spirit monarch Lion’s Head!

One punch, two punches, three punches.

Qin Yu’s strength was so great that even the spirit monarch lion was in unbearable pain.

It shook its body crazily, but it couldn’t do anything to Qin Yu!

The Spirit Monarch Lion’s combat techniques were very poor. The reason why it was dangerous was because of its unparalleled defensive ability.

However, this defensive ability was not enough in front of Qin Yu.

His strength was enough to break through the Spirit Monarch Lion’s defense. Once he lost this advantage, the spirit monarch Lion would be like a lamb waiting to be slaughtered.

Qin Yu’s fists were like raindrops, continuously smashing towards the spirit monarch Lion’s head.

In the blink of an eye, Qin Yu had already punched out a few hundred times.

At this moment, the Spirit Monarch Lion’s head was already dripping with blood, and its skull was fractured.

But even so, he still did not die.

“Damn, this Beast’s defense really isn’t weak.”Qin Yu could not help but curse.

One had to know that this was a few hundred punches!

If it was a human mighty figure, he would have been smashed into meat paste by these few hundred punches!

“Whoosh!”

The Spirit Monarch Lion exerted force and threw Qin Yu down.

He slid on the ground for hundreds of meters before he stabilized his body.

“Looks like I won’t be able to kill him this way,”Qin Yu thought to himself in a low voice.

This spirit monarch lion was more powerful than Protector Ren, and its defense was also more powerful.

“Looks like I can only rely on the battle word formula,”Qin Yu said in a low voice.

After saying this, Qin Yu closed his eyes slightly. The first level of the battle word formula was activated in his mind!

At this moment, Qin Yu’s strength instantly skyrocketed!

He quickly walked towards the spirit monarch lion, intending to end its life with one punch!

The Spirit Monarch Lion also quickly raised its palm and fiercely slapped towards Qin Yu!

The collision between the flesh palm and the fist was earth-shattering.

Waves of Qi swept out in all directions like water ripples.

Guan Zhuang, who could not dodge in time, was swept by this internal QI, and his sternum was instantly broken, and he vomited blood continuously!

“Puchi!”

At this moment, Qin Yu’s fist directly pierced through the spirit monarch Lion’s flesh palm!

His body shot out from the Spirit Monarch Lion’s flesh palm and headed straight for the Spirit Monarch Lion’s chin!

“Bang!”

This punch instantly fractured the spirit monarch Lion’s chin.

Its brain was in a state of unconsciousness, and its huge body was swaying from side to side.

“Level two of the battle word technique!”

Qin Yu did not waste any more time and directly activated the level two of the battle word technique!

It was actually quite difficult to kill the Spirit Monarch Lion on the first level! DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“Let’s try taking another punch!”Qin Yu roared, and his fist actually flashed with a radiance!

This was the radiance that erupted from the pure power of the physical body. It was extremely terrifying!

At that moment, Qin Yu’s fist became incomparably huge, comparable to the Spirit Monarch Lion’s Head!

“Boom!”

This punch landed squarely on the head of the Spirit Monarch Lion.

Finally, the spirit monarch lion could not hold on any longer.

Its body stiffened for half a second, and then it fell straight down.

“Phew, this beast is really hard to kill. No wonder it killed so many hunters,”Qin Yu muttered.

Guan Zhuang swallowed his saliva. He quickly ran in front of Qin Yu and said, “You... you killed it just like that? It’s that simple?”

“Simple?”Qin Yu could not help but smile bitterly.

This fist looked simple, but it was formed by fusing all of Qin Yu’s will.

Each punch was comparable to hundreds of moves.

“You don’t seem to have used any spirit energy at all,”Guan Zhuang said with a frown.

Qin Yu was silent for a moment before saying, “Yes, because there is no spirit energy in my body at all.”

“No Spirit Energy?”Guan Zhuang was even more shocked. “Then you...”

Qin Yu smiled and said, “I was born with godly power.”

Guan Zhuang was speechless. Then, he gave Qin Yu a thumbs up and said, “You are really a F * cking genius! Who exactly are you?”
