Chapter 1240: Chapter 1,240, communication with the Guardian 

The two of them sped through the air, but the distance between them remained dozens of meters.

Qin Yu was not a fool. Of course, he could see that his father had done this on purpose, so he was not in a hurry. He just followed behind them.

The two of them sprinted for dozens of kilometers. Even Qin Yu’s divine power began to feel dry.

Finally, they arrived near a cliff.

It was a barren land, as if no one had ever set foot on it.

Looking at the near-primitive scenery around them, Qin Yu also felt a trace of surprise.

He panted slightly, his eyes looking straight at the rather tall guardian standing in front of him.

Qin Yu said coldly, “Why didn’t You Save My Mother? With your ability, killing them would be effortless!”

The Guardian’s back was facing Qin Yu. He seemed to have guessed that Qin Yu would ask this question, so he was not surprised.

“Say it!”

The Guardian did not speak for a long time. Qin Yu could not help but feel a little anxious and immediately shouted.

“It is my duty. I can not make a move.”The Guardian was silent for a long time before he finally said this.

Qin Yu gritted his teeth and said, “Just because of a duty, you can ignore the woman you love? Do you know how much criticism she has received because of you?”

Hearing this, the guardian let out a long sigh.

He said indifferently, “Standing in this position, you have to abandon the feelings between individuals. Otherwise, how can you guarantee fairness and Justice?”

“I have seen too many people’s life and death separation. Whether I make a move or not, there will be a day when there will be a difference. I can not change any outcome.”

Qin Yu opened his mouth. Just as he was about to speak, the Guardian interrupted Qin Yu.

He said coldly, “Do you think that I will ignore it in order to protect this position? Do you think the Guardian is a piece of cake?”

Qin Yu was stunned and frowned. “What do you mean?”

“Since ancient times, this has been a hard job. I Can’t explain it to you now. You will understand it in the future,”The Guardian said in a deep voice.

With Qin Yu’s current state of mind, how could he understand so much.

What Great Love? What Little Love? In his eyes, everything was Bullsh * t.

“If you can’t even protect the people around you, then how can you protect others?”Qin Yu took a deep breath.

“I don’t understand it now, and I may not understand it in the future. I think I will never understand you.”

The Guardian said indifferently, “I never expected anyone to understand me, not even my own son.”

Qin Yu gritted his teeth and said, “Then why did you save me? Can’t you just let me die?”

Hearing this, the Guardian’s body clearly trembled slightly.

“I don’t want to answer this question,”The Guardian said coldly.

A gentle wind blew in the sky, and Qin Yu’s eyes were filled with tears.

“Qin Yu, I can only say that I’m sorry,”the Dao-guardian said slowly.

“No matter how much pain you’ve suffered, I can’t do anything about it. You Don’t have to understand me. You can even hate me. But you have to know that I love you both.”

For some reason, the grievance that had been buried in his heart for so many years exploded at this moment.

Qin Yu couldn’t see the Guardian’s face clearly, nor did he know what the Guardian’s expression was.

The Guardian let out a long sigh. He was just about to speak when Qin Yu suddenly rushed over from not too far away.

The Guardian frowned slightly. He seemed to have sensed something.

However, he stood there without moving at all, as if he was prepared to be beaten up by Qin Yu.

The Guardian closed his eyes slightly and waited for Qin Yu’s fist.

However, Qin Yu, who had rushed behind the Guardian, hugged him from behind.

Even the Guardian, whose heart was as hard as stone, could not help but be slightly startled at this moment.

“Dad, I miss you guys so much... I’ve thought about you guys every day since I was young...”

Qin Yu lay on the back of the Guardian, sobbing uncontrollably.

No one would not miss their parents when they were children.

This kind of blood relationship could not be replaced by anyone.

Qin Yu had never felt the warmth of his parents, which caused him to lack love since he was young, especially the love of his parents.

No matter how much Qin Yu complained, it still could not drown out the longing in his heart.

The Guardian slowly turned his body and looked down at Qin Yu, he said in a low voice, “Qin Yu, you will be the strongest person in this world. Your achievements will definitely be above me, or even anyone else. This is me, and also what your mother has always believed in.”

Qin Yu’s face was covered in tears. He wanted to say that he did not want to be the strongest person, but only wanted an ordinary and warm family.

But in the end, he didn’t say it out loud. He just wiped his tears and forcefully held back his tears.

The determination that flashed across his face made the Guardian feel both gratified and a bit of guilt and heartache.

He raised his thick palm and gently patted on Qin Yu’s shoulder.

“Yan Ruoxue is a good girl. You have to work hard. Otherwise, you won’t be worthy of him,”said the guardian with a gentle smile.

Qin Yu took a deep breath and clenched his fists. “I’ve already walked on this path. I don’t have any other choice. One day, I won’t only protect myself.”

I will protect everyone around me.

Including you, the high and Mighty Guardian.

Qin Yu didn’t say these words out loud. Instead, he buried them deep in his heart.

He was done complaining. He was done complaining about his grievances. He still had to live his life.

Qin Yu no longer had any lingering feelings. He turned around and left.

The Guardian looked at Qin Yu’s back. No one knew what he was thinking about.

A moment later, his figure slowly disappeared. It was as if he had merged into the void, disappearing without a trace.
