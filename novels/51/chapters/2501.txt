2502 All Out

Looking at Su Xinghe, Ksitigarbha chuckled and said.

“This time, it’s probably another attempt by the alien race to test the human race. So far, aside from the recent joint attack by the demon and monster races, all other conflicts have been individual races against the human race. Even Kunlun, one of the two great sacred sects, has sent their strongest people. This has probably been brewing for a long time.”

Lei Xin looked incredibly solemn. The air was enveloped by various powerful internal qi.

Many people might not have seen as many supreme powerful figures in their entire lifetime as they did this time.

“This is also a conspiracy involving the three races. The two sacred sects, including the four sects and four schools, have been silent for a long time. Even for the demon and the ghost race, there was no reliable information previously. This time, the appearance of the various higher-ups is to force all the higher-ups to show up. If they can directly suppress the human race, the Si family will be the sacrifice this time. Si Shiyue is just a catalyst. Just as Immortal Crane said, the kid’s play is over. Now it’s time for the adults to play the game…”

Flower Granny’s face was full of bitterness. Almost everyone showing up here possessed top-tier talent.

At this moment, they could only be spectators and thus could not help but feel a sense of bitterness.

“Hahaha, it’s so lively here! We meet again, little fellow.”

A barefooted loli appeared in front of Qin Yu out of nowhere. She grinned and stared at Qin Yu.

The barefooted loli in front had curly fluffy hair gently swaying with the breeze, giving off a dreamy sensation like an elf from a fairyland.

The tip of her nose slightly raised, revealing a hint of playfulness and cuteness.

However, facing her at this moment, Qin Yu felt a sense of danger that caused his hair to stand on end.

Her frail body seemed to contain the power that could destroy heaven and earth. Even if her body seemed frail and powerless, Qin Yu sensed the danger at the utmost of his sixth sense.

“I don’t know when I’ve met Senior.”

Qin Yu hurriedly cupped his fists in respect, afraid of angering this little loli of unknown origin in front of him.

“I don’t like this kind of refined mannerisms. It wasn’t like this when you killed that annoying brat from the Ten Thousand Buddha Sect.”

The little loli made a cute piglet face.

As soon as she finished speaking, Qin Yu felt a few unfriendly gazes fall on him. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

They were the few people from the Ten Thousand Buddha Sect. At this moment, their divine eyes flickered with dense killing intent.

Qin Yu felt his scalp tingling. He did not sense the presence of anyone when he killed that monk.

How did this loli pry into the whole situation and openly speak about it without any reservation?

“Lolita, you like to act cute.”

Lei Xin frowned and seemed to have thought of something.

Suddenly, he looked tremendously terrified. “You are…”

Seeing the little loli’s unfriendly gaze, he quickly swallowed the rest of his words.

He had a lingering fear. He would probably be killed by this loli who was like Asura if he were to say it out.

“Hahaha, it’s so lively here! How can we monster race not join in the fun?”

Countless sharp laughter echoed in the sky.

Amidst that void, suddenly, shadows of monsters loomed densely.

Suddenly, a dark cloud appeared in the sky, shrouding the entire world in darkness and blocking the sunlight.

Almost concurrently, a surge of green evil flame suddenly appeared on the ground. Black smoke surrounded the flame and emitted terrifying heat and destructive power.

The surrounding environment suddenly became gloomy and terrifying. Demonic qi filled the air, causing the flowers and plants to wither and the water origin to become foul. Creatures fled, forming a deathly silent land.

Waves of mournful cries and terrifying howls came from afar, and the space suddenly shook rhythmically.

The space in the distance became blurred, and the sky seemed to have been covered by dark clouds. Endless muffled footsteps came from all directions.

The sky was dark and covered with dark clouds as if the entire world was shrouded in haze.

All the sounds in the world seemed to have been drowned by the dull footsteps. An army seemed to be walking toward them.

In the depths of the space, the endless spatial turbulence was like an invisible crack, distorting and folding the depths of the space.

In the depths of the spatial rift, the distance of one foot might become tens of millions of feet when spreading.

Without Spatial Magic Artifact, some people could not cross this distance even if they were drifting in the void for their entire lives.

Therefore, when Qin Yu was banished from the Holy Region, almost everyone thought he would not survive.

“It’s so scary!”

Yan Ruoxue could not help but say as she felt the fluctuations in the depths of the space.

In that space, storm-like energy raged, and it was impossible to predict the order of events.

The chaotic energy filled the turbulence in the void. Strange runes and lightning flashed, creating a chaotic scene. The power of this was unimaginable.

The power of some of the lightning and runes was even more terrifying than the Nine Dragon Thunder Tribulation.

However, when this violent power came into contact with the pitch-black monster race army, it seemed to become docile instantly.

Countless powers of the turbulence in the void slowly fell beneath the feet of the leading monster race general covered with massive muscles and paved a transparent path on the ground slowly.

Five thousand eight-winged monster race and a gigantic monster race general suddenly descended upon the Holy Region.

Following the appearance of this army, the Four Great Godly Kings of the monster race also appeared on the continent of the human race.

“Hahaha, we meet again, Qin Yu!”

He Teng laughed maniacally the moment he appeared.

His body was burning with demonic flames at this moment, and his strength had increased compared to previously.

Previously, Wan Li’s desperate attack could not injure him, and his cultivation had advanced further.

He had become the leader of many Godly Kings at this point. He had completely become the Fallen Godly King of the monster race.

“Brat, you invaded the monster race and disrupted our ritual offerings. If not for that, our monster race would have already formed a ten-winged monster race. We will definitely kill you today.”

He Teng let out a shrill scream. At this moment, his human memories seemed to have been erased.

As he spoke, his memories of the past did not reveal.

He Teng would definitely mock him as a human.

“If it wasn’t for me, would you, He Teng, be able to obtain the power of sacrifice and become the new Fallen Godly King? You can now kowtow to Grandpa and thank me!”

Qin Yu hid behind the little loli and then mocked.

“Qin Yu! Now that I’ve inherited the power of the monster race’s Path of Heaven, I can kill you effortlessly. You’re really pitiful. You’ve become so weak now!”

Suddenly, He Teng seemed provoked by Qin Yu, and his face contorted.

The other half of his soul suddenly occupied He Teng’s body again. The human race He Teng’s obsession was Qin Yu.

After seeing Qin Yu, even though his soul had been suppressed all this time, it still erupted with endless power to control his body again.

At this moment, not only the alliance but also the four sects and four schools were looking at Qin Yu.
