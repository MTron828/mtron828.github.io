1972 Don’t Even Think about Getting One

Qin Yu squinted his eyes, sneered, and said, “It’s pretty fast.”

“Mr. Qin, please come with me,” the attendant said.

“Mmm,” Qin Yu responded. Then he followed the attendant to the Great Hall.

When they arrived at the Great Hall, a table had been set up on one side of the hall. Two Semi-Saints of the Si family were sitting there.

One of them was old, and the other young. Both were extremely powerful.

Seeing Qin Yu, the two stood up immediately.

“Don’t get agitated,” the prince quickly said.

The two snorted coldly and sat down again.

Qin Yu directly sat opposite them, then said with a faint smile, “Is there anything you two need from me?”

“Don’t play dumb. Do you think you can hide here?” one of the Semi-Saints said coldly.

“I haven’t played dumb for a long time,” Qin Yu said with a smile. “I really don’t understand what you’re talking about.”

“Kid, Young Master Feng is still lying in bed and can’t get up. Do you think the matter is over?” one of the Semi-Saints said gloomily.

“Hahaha!” Hearing this, Qin Yu couldn’t help but burst into laughter.

“So you’re saying you’ve looking for me to take revenge for Si Shifeng? What? He couldn’t afford to lose? Or your Si family?” Qin Yu’s tone was full of sarcasm.

The Semi-Saint immediately realized he had said something wrong and immediately changed his words, “Nonsense! We’re here because you stole the Si family’s ores!”

“Oh, so it’s because of the ores.” Qin Yu sneered, and the mockery in his eyes increased.

“Qin Yu said he’s willing to give half of the ores back to the Si family,” the prince said, trying to smooth things over.

“Half?” Qin Yu was stunned and immediately looked at the prince.

The prince was still smiling and didn’t look abnormal.

“He took away our family’s things and wants to return half? He must be dreaming!” the Semi-Saint scolded.

The prince sighed and said, “I’ve sent people to Serene South City to investigate this matter. Strictly speaking, these ores do not belong to the Si family. Since Qin Yu is willing to return half of them, we should settle the matter.”

Hearing the prince’s words, the two Semi-Saints’ faces turned cold.

“Your Highness, what do you mean by this? Are you trying to stand up for Qin Yu?” one of the Semi-Saints said coldly.

“Of course, I don’t mean that,” the prince said with a smile. “I just want to make peace and find a perfect way to solve this matter.”

“I think Your Highness should expel Qin Yu,” the Semi-Saint sneered and said.

Qin Yu knew the Si family wouldn’t give up so readily, so he stood up and said, “Then I’ll return all the ores to you, and we’ll call it a day. How about it?”

“What? You stole our things, and now you’re just returning them? You must be dreaming!” the Semi-Saint sneered and said.

Seeing this, Qin Yu could not help but sneer.

“Qin Yu has shown her sincerity,” the prince tried to smooth things over. “I think we should just leave it at that.”

One of the Semi-Saints was about to speak when he heard the prince’s words but was stopped by the old Semi-Saint beside him.

“Since Your Highness has spoken, how about allowing us to discuss it?” the old Semi-Saint said.

The young Semi-Saint opened his mouth and was about to speak, but he was stopped again.

“Of course,” the prince nodded and said.

Without saying much, the two Semi-Saints stood up and walked out.

After a while, the two returned.

“Your Highness, since you’ve spoken, we’ll agree to it,” the young Semi-Saint changed his attitude and said politely.

“Of course, we have to give some face to Your Highness,” the old Semi-Saint said with a smile.

Seeing this, the prince was quite pleased. He stood up and said, “If that’s the case, it’s decided. We…”

“Hold on.” Qin Yu suddenly stood up at this moment.

He looked at the two Semi-Saints opposite him coldly and said with a faint smile, “I’m sorry. I’ve changed my mind.”

The prince was stunned. He looked at Qin Yu in confusion and said in a low voice, “Mr. Qin, you…”

Qin Yu ignored the prince and looked at the two Semi-Saints coldly.

“Qin Yu, what do you mean by this?” the Semi-Saint asked coldly.

Qin Yu sneered and said, “I mean what I said. I’m going back on my word. Now, don’t even think about getting a single ore. Not even one!”

“Kid, I think you’re crazy!” the young Semi-Saint shouted.

The old Semi-Saint also squinted his eyes slightly. He put his hands behind his back and said, “Your Highness, did you see that? We’ve given you face, but this kid doesn’t know how to appreciate it.”

The prince hurriedly came forward and advised, “Mr. Qin, this is your last chance. You…”

“Your Highness, you’re overthinking. Even if I give them the ores, they still won’t let me go,” Qin Yu said coldly.

“If I’m not wrong, you’ll find an excuse to say I didn’t return you enough ores, right?”

The two Semi-Saints’ expressions changed slightly. Qin Yu was right.

“I’m just trying to frame you. How could you just let it go?” Qin Yu sneered and said.

“If that’s the case, don’t even think about getting a single ore. I’ll sell them all tomorrow.”

After saying that, Qin Yu turned around and left.

Seeing this, the two Semi-Saints immediately stopped Qin Yu.

...

Qin Yu did not panic. He sneered and said, “What? Are you guys planning to fight in the Prince of Great Xia’s Great Hall in Sky City?”

“I…” The Semi-Saint was stunned. Obviously he didn’t dare to do so.

“Qin Yu, we might not dare to make a move, but that doesn’t mean the other members of the Si family dare not,” the old Semi-Saint said indifferently.

Qin Yu raised his eyebrows and said, “Oh? Is that so? Then please invite the head of your family to come over. I’ll wait for him here.”

After saying this, Qin Yu turned to leave. Unfortunately, the two Semi-Saints still blocked his way.

“A good dog doesn’t block the way. Don’t you two b*stards understand?” Jue Wu arrived just in time at this moment.

The two Semi-Saints glanced at Jue Wu, snorted coldly, and said, “Who are you? How dare you meddle in our business?”

“I’m your father!” Jue Wu ruthlessly cursed. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

The two Semi-Saints were about to flare up when Qin Yu sneered and said, “Her name is Jue Wu. She was once the leader of the three lunatics in Nanzhou. To her, there are no rules. When she goes crazy, no one can stop her. You can try attacking her and see.

“In any case, Jue Wu is alone, and you have the Si family behind you. When the time comes, I’d like to see how your Si family will explain this to the world!”

After hearing Qin Yu’s words, Jue Wu was also ready to make her move.
