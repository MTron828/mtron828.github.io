Chapter 1615: Chapter 1615, Yongji, we finally meet! 1 Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Kong you regarded himself as a lobbyist and was extremely confident.

He stepped into the back of the mountain and walked towards Yongji.

“Mr. Yongji.”Kong you cupped his hands slightly towards Yongji.

Yongji was slightly surprised. This was the only person who greeted him so far today.

“Why?”Yong Ji raised his eyebrows.

Kong you smiled and said, “Mr. Yong Ji, since you have the intention to negotiate peace with our South region, this is enough to show that you don’t want the two sides to continue fighting. Or rather, you still miss the South Region.”

Hearing this, Yong Ji almost laughed out loud.

Miss the South Region? Is there something wrong with this guy’s brain?

Yong Ji smiled and didn’t say anything, indicating for him to continue.

“Firstly, I want to express my gratitude to you. Secondly, I hope that you can convince the northern lands to end this cruel struggle. I believe that anything can be resolved through negotiations,”Kong you said with a faint smile.

Yong Ji rolled his eyes, then said, “Who do you think will win between the northern lands and the Southern Region?”

“En... it’s hard to say. After all, the strength of the sect master of the Heavenly Cloud sect is obvious to everyone,”Kong you said.

Yong Ji’s expression became a little unnatural when the sect master was mentioned.

He continued to ask, “Oh right, have you seen the sect master in the Tianyun sect these past few days?”

Kong you shook his head and said, “I’ve really never seen him before.”

Yong Ji was delighted in his heart and immediately believed in his own thoughts.

The sect master of the Tianyun sect had never returned!

“I hope that Mister Yong Ji can become a bridge between the southern region and the northern lands and end this war,”Kong you continued to say to himself.

However, Yong Ji laughed coldly in his heart.

He looked at Kong you in front of him and said faintly, “Okay, I will give you an explanation.”

“Thank you, Mr. Yong Ji!”Kong you hurriedly cupped his hands, and a trace of pride appeared on his face.

He had mistakenly thought that he had convinced Yong Ji with his negotiation ability.

Little did he know that Yong Ji had long had the desire to kill in his heart.

When he returned to the crowd, the people around him quickly surrounded him.

“How is it? What did Yong Ji say?”The people beside him couldn’t wait to ask.

Kong you said faintly, “Of course there’s no problem. Mr. Yong Ji has promised that he will become a bridge of friendship between our southern region and the northern lands.”

“Is that true?”The people around him were slightly surprised.

“It’s absolutely true. He personally agreed!”Kong you said proudly.

“Yongji is not a reliable person. It’s better to be careful,”someone said worriedly.

Hearing this, Kong you immediately said with some displeasure, “What do you mean? You Don’t believe me? I, Kong You, am a famous lobbyist in the South Province!”

“It’s not that I don’t believe you, but I just don’t believe Yongji. I hope he can keep his word,”the person next to him sighed.

Kong you sneered and said, “Do you know why Yongji chose Yongji City as the location? This is enough to show that he still cares about our South Province. So, everyone, you don’t have to worry!”

With Kong You’s words, everyone felt a little more at ease.

More and more people came to the venue one after another. Many mighty figures who had been reclusive for many years also came to the venue.

These people were very rare. Some rumors had even said that they had passed away long ago. Now that they had appeared again, it was enough to show the importance of this banquet.

Yong Ji sat on the throne with his eyes slightly closed, as if he was waiting for something.

As time passed, the people of the Heavenly Cloud sect also arrived at the scene.

Under Di Zun’s signal, the eighteen gods once again pretended to be the sect master of the Heavenly Cloud sect.

Upon seeing this “Sect master”, many people at the scene walked over.

“Greetings, Sect Master!”Someone cupped his hands and said.

“Sect master, your battle was truly unprecedented. You killed a godly king of the northern lands with just a divine stone. It really makes us admire you!”

However, this sect master did not say a word. He was extremely silent.

Di Zun was afraid that the matter would be exposed, so he quickly pulled the eighteen gods to find a place to sit down.

On the throne, Yong Ji frowned.

Although he knew that this sect master in front of him was fake, he still felt uneasy.

“It’s just a fake. What’s there to be afraid of!”Yong Ji tried his best to cheer himself up.

He closed his eyes slightly and simply did not look at the fake sect master anymore.

In the blink of an eye, it was already noon. Almost everyone who was supposed to be there had arrived.

“Please come and chat with the sect master of the Heavenly Cloud Sect.”

Yong Ji suppressed the fear in his heart and shouted in the direction of the eighteen gods. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

However, the eighteen gods sat there motionlessly and kept silent as if they didn’t hear anything.

“Please take a step forward, sect master of the Heavenly Cloud Sect, to discuss the important matters of the southern region and the northern lands,”Yong Ji shouted again.

The eighteen gods were still sitting there motionlessly.

Di Zun, who was beside him, saw that things were not looking good. He hurriedly stood up and said, “Yong Ji, I’ve already said that our sect master is unwell and can not speak or negotiate. If there’s anything, I can represent the sect master.”

When Yong Ji saw this, he could not help but sneer in his heart.

“You lied to me once and you want to lie to me a second time?”Yong Ji said coldly in his heart.

Therefore, he ignored di zun and shouted in the direction of the eighteen gods for the third time, “Sect Master of the Heavenly Cloud Sect, please take a step forward and have a chat!”

At this moment, the eighteen gods suddenly stood up!

The sudden action scared Yong Ji so much that he trembled.

He subconsciously took two steps back, and sweat broke out on his face.

The eighteen gods stood up, buttoned their butts, and sat down again.

When Yong Ji saw this, he couldn’t help but tremble with anger.

Thinking of his loss of self-control just now, he wished he could slap himself twice!

Yong Ji suppressed the anger in his heart and said coldly, “Sect master, please take a step forward.”

“Don’t you understand human language? Keep calling out, call out my A * S.”

At this moment, a voice came from afar.

Before everyone could regain their senses, they saw a huge divine hawk hovering in the sky!

The Divine Hawk’s arms shook, creating gusts of wind.

Qin Yu and Wen Wanye jumped down from their backs and landed in the center.

His eyes looked straight in the direction of Yongji and sneered, “What, Yongji, are you representing the northern lands? What right do you have to shout here?”

“Qin Yu!”

Looking at Qin Yu in front of him, Yong Ji instantly lost his composure.

He suddenly stood up from his throne and glared angrily at Qin Yu, wishing he could swallow Qin Yu whole.

“What, are you surprised to see me?”Qin Yu sneered.

Yong Ji narrowed his eyes and said, “Kid, you finally dare to show your face. What, aren’t you a coward anymore?”

“Shut your dog mouth. Look at your behavior. You are born to be a dog. Do you think you can replace the Heavenly Cloud Sect? Why don’t you see if you have that fate?”Wen Wan ridiculed from the side.

These words undoubtedly hit Yong Ji’s soft spot. Being able to replace the Heavenly Cloud sect and become the overlord of a region had always been his long-cherished wish! Unfortunately, from the South region to the north region, he had always been under people!
