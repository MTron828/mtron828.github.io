Chapter 2545 The Demonic Brilliance Divine Power

“If it weren’t for Qin Yu’s Primordial Chaos power dispersing most of its strength, we wouldn’t have been able to seal it. Qin Yu’s credit for killing the Flame Demon is second to none this time. There’s no need to be modest about it.”

Xuan Tian said with a smile.

“However, Qin Yu, your power is indeed earth-shattering, but I’m afraid you’ve already reached your ultimate power. This is probably disastrous for you, and you must be very careful.”

Xuan Xin suppressed his joy and reminded Qin Yu.

Qin Yu nodded. This fellow was indeed remarkable, able to grasp the concept of ultimate power.

The power that Xuan Xin could unleash was probably not simple either.

While the few were talking, the power of meditation’s tentacle that had entered Qin Yu’s body and soul slowly disappeared, and a profound sense of extreme weakness spread to Qin Yu’s sea of consciousness.

His glazed holy bone made a crisp cracking sound.

Even the hardest holy bone of the spine had countless cracks.

An intense feeling of weakness suddenly spread through Qin Yu’s divine sea, and Heart of the Ocean seemed to have sensed Qin Yu’s weakness.

The azure blue energy frantically entered every part of his body.

Dizziness suddenly drilled into his mind, and Qin Yu could no longer restrain himself and fell to the ground.

The ultimate power that could shatter 70 – 80% of Flame Demon was not something a human body could unleash.

If not for the monster race’s Way of Meditation and the Heart of the Ocean of the demons, Qin Yu’s entire body would have turned into ashes the moment the Primordial Chaos power appeared in his dantian.

“Are you alright, Qin Yu?”

Seeing Qin Yu’s slightly pale expression, Shen Qian quickly helped him up.

“I’m fine, but I won’t be able to continue fighting for the time being.”

Qin Yu said with a bitter smile.

The second time he used the Primordial Chaos power, he seemed to have slightly better control but could not resist this terrifying power of backlash.

“Qin Yu, the protective energy that you unleashed at the end seemed to be from the cultivation of a monster body. If it wasn’t for this energy, your body would probably have directly collapsed and exploded. Is that so?”

Xuan Tian hesitated several times before finally asking.

“That’s right. I once fought against the Fallen Godly King, and the power was indeed incomparably profound. Moreover, I’ve cut off an arm of the Fallen Godly King with the higher-ups of Human Race Watch. That’s why I managed to get a glimpse of this power.”

Xuan Tian’s cultivation was also at the Tribulation Fifth Level, although the power he erupted was not as potent as Xuan Xin’s.

However, he had incredibly sharp insight. Qin Yu had only displayed this power once, and he could immediately see the core. He also wanted to discuss with Qin Yu if there was any way to improve the power of meditation.

“Qin Yu is indeed a peerless genius. To be able to comprehend such a heaven-defying skill through a battle and a body, such talent is tremendously rare, even in the two great sacred sects. Your rank among the younger disciples in your generation is undoubtedly within the top five.”

Xuan Tian said again.

All the other five people revealed shocked expressions. Comparing Qin Yu to the geniuses of the two sacred sects, they might have scoffed at it if someone else made such an evaluation.

However, it came from Xuan Tian, and they were even more shocked.

Xuan Tian seemed to know what Qin Yu was thinking.

“During the time of the ancient Three Purities Sect, there were seniors in the sect who had comprehended something similar to this power during the long battle with the monster race, and they called it the Demonic Brilliance Divine Power. You might have heard of this cultivation method in the history of the sect.”

“The core of the Demonic Brilliance Divine Power is the fusion of the body and the soul. However, this also means that the future variables are thrown into the air. Therefore, the ancestors who cultivated this were all very careful in their cultivation. However, after several major battles, they still used this monster race power to the greatest extent. Their souls directly degraded into the physical bodies, weakening the perception of the Path of Heaven.”

Qin Yu nodded. He also had the same feeling.

After using the power of meditation, a portion of his soul had already fused with his physical body.

Especially in the final moments when he faced the Titan King’s and Death Godly King’s all-out sneak attacks, he had no choice but to use this power to the extreme. Otherwise, he would not have been able to forcefully withstand the combined attacks of the two of them with his physical body. This also led to even more irreversible fusion.

Now that Xuan Tian pointed it out, he felt this matter was somewhat serious.

“Demonic Brilliance Divine Power is a demonic technique of the physical body. This kind of power was indeed tremendously terrifying at the beginning. Therefore, at that time, many experts of the Three Purities Sect tried to continue developing this demonic technique. However, as their souls gradually degraded into their physical bodies, they began to experience tremendously serious consequences.”

Taking the opportunity of the temporary silence in Misty Forest, he told Qin Yu the history of the three sects.

“The sects’ martial uncles began to show signs of uncontrollable wills. Initially, they just found it difficult to concentrate on their wills, but after that, their thoughts became unclear. In the end, they all became killing machines for the monster race. Therefore, this Demonic Brilliance Divine Power cultivation method has become taboo for Taoism. One must not cultivate this technique in the sect. Otherwise, one’s cultivation will be crippled and expelled.”

Xuan Tian glanced at Qin Yu, his eyes revealing a trace of bafflement.

“Subsequently, the sect masters and the other Saints analyzed and discovered that the Demonic Brilliance Divine Power had caused the dark power in the monster race’s body to gradually erode the body, distort it, and make it evil. Moreover, the cultivation of physical demonic techniques would cause a massive burden on the body, which could significantly reduce the cultivator’s lifespan and enter the aging state ahead of time. In addition, it also confused their consciousness and caused negative effects on their mental state, making them lose their rationality and fall into a crazy state.”

After the history of the Three Purities Sect was told, everyone fell into a dead silence.

“Senior Brother, are there no exceptions for those who cultivate Demonic Brilliance Divine Power?”

Shen Rou asked carefully.

“Among the eight top geniuses who cultivated, one even had the potential to become a Saint. In the end, he became a violent murderer and brought great damage to the Three Purities Sect. Qin Yu, you must be mentally prepared. When this matter is over, I will report to the sect master and extract all the information of the eight seniors. I hope it can help you overcome the difficulties. However, before that, it’s best not to use this Demonic Brilliance Divine Power again.” Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Xuan Tian said solemnly.

Qin Yu nodded, and his tensed body gradually relaxed.

The look that flashed past Xuan Tian’s face just now was clearly filled with killing intent.

If this guy attacked, with his current physical condition, he could not resist at all. Moreover, the five people around him were not ordinary. Fortunately, this guy was not someone who did not care about martial arts ethics.

“Qin Yu, can I ask you a question?”

Xuan Tian said softly. He did not wait for Qin Yu’s response before throwing out his question.
