Chapter 939: Chapter 939, fighting with the immortal crane 

Qin Yu was delighted and could not help but think to himself, “This immortal crane is quite particular.”

Under normal circumstances, Qin Yu did not have the qualifications to bargain at all.

Moreover, the immortal crane’s strength was beyond imagination and was not inferior to star seizer!

To be able to fight with someone at the same level as him was also a rare experience for him. It could even rapidly improve his state of mind and help him step into the martial saint realm!

“Okay!”Qin Yu immediately nodded and agreed.

The crane stood up and said, “Wait for me here at this time tomorrow.”

“Okay.”Qin Yu bowed slightly and then left with the handlebar mustache.

After walking out of this grotto-heaven, the handlebar mustache said impatiently, “Qin Yu, my life is in your hands. You have to grasp it well!”

Qin Yu rolled his eyes and said, “You don’t have to say it. I Won’t miss this opportunity.”

At this point, Qin Yu paused and muttered, “But it’s really strange. Why did this immortal crane challenge the power of the Divine Dragon...”

The mustached man sneered and said, “You don’t understand. The power of the divine dragon to demon beasts is like an ancient subject meeting the Emperor.”

“Normally, when ordinary demon beasts see the power of the Divine Dragon, it’s good enough that they don’t care.”

Qin Yu said in surprise, “Is it really that serious?”

“If you don’t believe me, just find someone to test it out,”the mustached man muttered.

As he was speaking, a person walked over not far away.

He was in charge of bringing Qin Yu to the residence.

The three of them came to the vicinity of the residence. Qin Yu patted his shoulder and said, “Hello, May I ask if this Lord Immortal Crane’s true form is the immortal crane?”

That person hid to the side with a look of disgust. He said with a face full of disgust, “You’d better not touch me. Lord Immortal Crane Sparing Your dog life doesn’t mean that we will remain friendly to you.”

Qin Yu touched his chin. He thought for a moment and immediately activated the power of the Divine Dragon

The moment the mark of the Divine Dragon appeared, this person’s face was immediately filled with terror. His entire body was trembling non-stop.

Even though he forcefully endured it, his knees could not help but kneel down.

Qin Yu hurriedly withdrew the Divine Dragon’s power and said with slight embarrassment, “I’m really sorry. I was careless just now, it was definitely not intentional!”

This person completely ignored Qin Yu’s feelings. His eyes were filled with terror as he looked at Qin Yu. He turned around and ran.

“So the influence of the Divine Dragon’s power on demon beasts is so great...”Qin Yu muttered.

“Speaking of which, this crane is really awesome. It can actually be so calm and at ease when facing the power of the Divine Dragon...”Qin Yu couldn’t help but think to himself when he heard this.

This couldn’t help but make Qin Yu think of little black.

He could be considered one of the most courageous people Qin Yu had ever seen.

But even so, when facing the power of the Divine Dragon, he almost knelt down.

Only this crane only frowned, and could even attack him.

“Sigh, for this crane to cultivate to such a realm, I roughly estimate that it must have lived for more than a thousand years,”the mustached man said while stroking his beard.

Qin Yu said in surprise, “It’s already so old?”

“What do you think? The cultivation of demon beasts is much more difficult than ours, but once they cultivate and take shape, their strength will far surpass that of humans,”the mustached man muttered.

Qin Yu did not say a word. However, he could not help but feel a little more admiration for this immortal crane in his heart. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

The next day.

Qin Yu arrived at this grotto-heaven according to the agreement.

The Immortal Crane seemed to have been waiting here for a long time. It had a head of long white hair and a nearly perfect figure. It looked like a handsome man who had walked out of a painting.

Qin Yu tried to sense its internal qi and discovered that the immortal crane had already suppressed its internal Qi to half a step into the martial saint realm.

“Let’s begin,”the immortal crane said expressionlessly.

Qin Yu did not waste any more time. He immediately activated the power of the Divine Dragon and released his Internal Qi!

The moment the power of the Divine Dragon appeared, the Immortal Crane’s brows furrowed slightly. In an extremely short period of time, beads of sweat appeared on its forehead.

This was enough to show how much pressure the power of the Divine Dragon was putting on it!

“This power of the divine dragon seems to be putting a lot of pressure on you,”said Qin Yu.

“It’s not fair to fight like this. Why don’t I lower my strength by one realm?”

“No Need,”said immortal crane coldly.

Before he could finish his words, immortal crane’s figure flashed explosively. His extremely fast speed even left behind afterimages, leaving Qin Yu completely unable to react!

Boom

The Crane’s palm slapped onto Qin Yu’s chest!

A gentle and overbearing force exploded on Qin Yu’s chest!

Even though Qin Yu had a chaotic body, he was still sent flying hundreds of meters by the strange force, and several of his sternum were broken!

Qin Yu crawled out of the ruins. He rubbed his chest and said in a low voice, “So powerful...”

This was probably the strongest opponent Qin Yu had ever met!

Most importantly, the two of them were of the same level!

“You’d better use your strength.”The Crane’s voice was a little breathless, and the sweat on its forehead kept flowing out.

Qin Yu moved his arms and said coldly, “Okay, then I’m Coming!”

Then, beams of golden light burst out from Qin Yu’s body, and his body was pushed to the limit!

“Be careful!”

Qin Yu shouted and immediately urged the absolute beginning holy fist, rushing toward the crane!
