Chapter 953: Chapter 953, cooperation 

“Entering the Martial Saint Realm?”Gu Xinghe’s pupils constricted.

Although there were people who had already entered the martial saint realm in the current era, it was extremely rare.

Even Jiang he and ye Qing, who were known as geniuses, were unable to enter the martial saint realm.

And there was not a single person in the younger generation!

Gu Xinghe narrowed his eyes and sneered, “Tian xuehong, drawing a cake for others is also my forte. Words have no basis, why should I believe you?”

Tianxue Hong couldn’t help but laugh out loud when he heard that.

“Drawing a pie? Do you think I’m the same as you?”Tianxue Hong’s eyes were full of ridicule.

“Do you know how powerful the immortal slaying sect was back then? If it wasn’t for the change of times, do you think you have the right to cooperate with me?”

Gu Xinghe sneered, “Yes, your immortal slaying sect is too powerful, so powerful that it was exterminated by one person.”

“You’re courting death!”

Hearing this, Tian Xuehong was instantly enraged!

He grabbed Gu Xinghe by the neck and lifted him into the air!

“I’m warning you, it’s best not to mention the massacre immortal sect.”Tian Xuehong’s eyes were filled with killing intent, and there seemed to be a hint of fear hidden in the depths of his killing intent.

Then, Tian Xuehong threw Gu Xinghe aside.

He took a deep breath and said, “I’ll tell you what I used these prisoners for, and how I recovered to my peak.”

“I’ll pass on the secret technique of the Massacre Immortal sect to you. As long as you obtain this secret technique, becoming a martial saint is nothing.”

Gu Xinghe tidied his clothes, then stood up and said, “Alright, I’ll agree to it.”

“Then don’t waste time. Take Me there now,”Tian Xuehong said coldly.

“Not Now.”Gu Xinghe shook his head. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Tian Xuehong’s face turned cold. “Why? Are you trying to lie to me?”

“No.”Gu Xinghe shook his head.

“Although I am in charge of the JINGDU martial arts association now, Zhai Xing doesn’t want me to do this.”

“If he interferes, it will be a troublesome matter for you.”

Tian Xuehong frowned.

He naturally saw that Zhai Xing was dissatisfied with him.

Although he wasn’t afraid of Zhai Xing with the white bone army that Tian Xuehong had, once they fought, it would be a troublesome matter.

“Then what are you going to do?”Tian Xuehong asked.

Gu Xinghe said calmly, “Give me three days. I will send Zhai Xing out. I Will Contact You Then.”

“Three days?”Tian Xuehong thought for a moment and then nodded, “Okay, I hope you won’t go back on your words after three days.”

After saying that, Tian Xuehong quickly left.

...

In the prison.

Qin Yu’s spiritual sense once again entered the space artifact.

He stood at the edge of the abyss and shouted, “Old Bastard, I’m here to See You Again!”

The Abyss shook, but no one replied.

Qin Yu said with a smile, “It’s that old thing who is locked in the abyss. I’m calling you!”

“Little Bastard, if I leave here one day, I’ll definitely kill you!”The light shouted.

Qin Yu rolled his eyes and said, “Let’s talk about it after you leave. I didn’t come here to quarrel with you today. I came here to ask for your help.”

“Help? Little Bastard, it’s already good enough that I didn’t kill you. You still want me to help you?”That voice said icily.

Qin Yu smiled and said, “Don’t be anxious. We can make a deal. I Won’t use you for nothing.”

The other party snorted coldly and didn’t say anything.

Qin Yu said to himself, “If you are willing to lend me your power, I can let you leave this place. How about it?”

Qin Yu planned to use the method he used to deal with the Earth Fiend Valley’s patriarch to deal with this glimmer of light.

Slowly absorb his power and then get rid of him!

“You Are Dreaming.”At this moment, a sneer came from below.

Qin Yu’s expression couldn’t help but change!

Could it be that he knew about it?

“Kid, that little thought of yours can’t Escape My Eyes.”The other party sneered.

“You Want to swindle my power? In your dreams!”

Qin Yu hurriedly said with an embarrassed smile, “I absolutely have no such intention, absolutely have no such intention. This is all a misunderstanding!”

“F * ck you!”The other party cursed loudly.

Qin Yu was so anxious that he scratched his ears and cheeks. However, no matter what Qin Yu said, the other party would not agree.

This made Qin Yu sit on the ground dejectedly.

“Sigh, if you don’t lend me your strength, I’m afraid I Won’t be able to escape,”Qin Yu muttered.

“Escape? Why? You bragged with me for a long time and ended up being locked up?”The other party’s voice carried a trace of ridicule.

Qin Yu muttered, “Yeah, not only did they lock me up, they even drew my blood every day. Damn, it really hurts me to death.”

“Draw your blood? Why? Is there something special about your blood?”The thread of light said.

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “I don’t know either. Maybe it’s because of my constitution.”

“Constitution? What do you mean?”The other party’s voice contained a trace of excitement.

“What Constitution do you have?”

Qin Yu said, “It’s said to be a chaotic constitution. Anyway, I don’t know much about it.”

“Chaotic constitution? !”The other party immediately became a little excited. Even that Ray of light became a few times bigger!

Qin Yu grunted and said, “If this continues, I’m afraid that my blood will be drained.”

“Are you sure you have a chaotic constitution?”He said coldly.

Qin Yu grunted and said helplessly, “Why would I lie to You?”

The other party fell into silence.

After a long time, he suddenly said, “Kid, it’s not impossible for me to help you.”

Qin Yu was delighted and quickly said, “Really?”

“I have a condition,”the other party said.

“What condition? Quickly say it!”Qin Yu said excitedly.

The other party said in a deep voice, “I don’t want other people’s bodies. I want to use yours.”

“The two of US share the same body. Otherwise, I’m afraid I’ll be cheated by you.”

Hearing this, Qin Yu’s brows immediately furrowed tightly.

Share a corpse?

Luo Jingyu had said that this glimmer of light was not a good bird.

If he were to occupy his own body, it would be troublesome.

“No, I can find you a similar body,”Qin Yu said.

“Then forget it.”However, the other party refused.

Qin Yu frowned and said, “Can’t I find you a similar body?”

“Hehe, do you think it’s so easy to find a special body? Cut the crap. If you don’t agree, forget it. Think about it yourself,”the other party said impatiently.

Then, he fell into silence. No matter what Qin Yu said, he couldn’t get a response.

Helpless, Qin Yu could only temporarily leave this spatial artifact.
