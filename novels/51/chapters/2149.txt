2150 One Against Ten

The thunderbolts exploded in the black light beam, and each explosion turned the surrounding air into a vacuum that collapsed rapidly in an instant under the pressure of the tense air, forming a series of deafening explosions.

The shock in the depths of the souls made people feel as if they were seeing the end of the world. That absolute power seemed to be able to wipe out all life easily. In the face of such power, people felt their insignificance and the fragility of their lives.

The expression of the people at Astral Mountain turned pale. They looked at the shocking scene, and horror filled their hearts.

They had heard of the power of the Saint but only now saw it with their own eyes. They now truly understood how terrifying this cultivation realm was.

That was a terrifying existence that people at their level could not understand or approach at all.

Si Liuhe was still activating his internal qi. His expression was solemn as he knew how terrifying this man before him was.

Not far away, Dean Lei was not having it easy either. As a chosen one, Si Jiuhe’s strength was not something an ordinary True Saint could compare to.

Their powerful internal qi intertwined in the air, forming waves that seemed to be able to shake the heavens and earth. The top of Astral Mountain was fully covered by the power of lightning and darkness as if it had become another world.

People could only watch from afar and not get close. They could clearly feel that the power was beyond their understanding. They could not even imagine how the power was produced.

And such power was only the prologue to this battle.

Lightning flashed in Dean Lei’s eyes. He clenched his fists and gathered all his strength. Si Liuhe did the same. He took a deep breath and waved his finger in the air. A dark crack suddenly appeared before him, like a bottomless black hole.

“Dean Lei, are you ready?” Si Liuhe asked coldly.

“Si Liuhe, you’ve forgotten my habit.” Dean Lei laughed. “I never prepare first. I only attack first!”

Then he stepped forward, and the lightning power in his hand surged and formed a lightning arrow, shooting toward Si Liuhe.

Wherever the arrow passed, the air seemed to be cut apart, emitting an ear-piercing screech.

Si Liuhe’s eyes flashed with a hint of surprise, but he did not panic. Instead, he became much calmer. He gently waved his finger in the air, and the dark crack suddenly expanded and directly swallowed the lightning arrow.

Then he waved his hand again, and a black light beam suddenly shot out from the dark crack, heading straight for Dean Lei.

A solemn expression appeared on Dean Lei’s face. He knew that this battle would not be easy. Si Liuhe’s power had exceeded his expectations. He dared not let his guard down because he knew the consequences would be unacceptable if he was hit by that black light beam.

Thus he gathered all his power again and condensed it into a massive lightning shield to meet the black light beam.

The black light beam collided with the lightning shield and immediately exploded with a dazzling light. The entire Astral Mountain lit up.

The powerful impact forced Dean Lei back a few steps. Si Liuhe’s expression changed slightly as well. Clearly, he did not expect Dean Lei to be able to withstand his attack.

However, at this moment, Dean Lei’s eyes suddenly flashed with a sharp light. He aimed at the source of the black light beam, which was at the dark crack in front of Si Liuhe.

Dean Lei shouted, and a powerful thunderbolt instantly burst out from his body rushing toward Si Liuhe. At the same time, he waved his right hand, and an even more powerful lightning arrow formed in his hand. Then he shot it toward the dark crack without hesitation.

Si Liuhe’s expression changed drastically. He hurriedly mobilized the power in his body and prepared to block Dean Lei’s attack. However, the lightning arrow was too fast, and he could not react in time.

While Si Liuhe was still in shock, the lightning arrow accurately hit the dark crack. In an instant, an indescribable power burst out. The dark crack started to shatter under the impact of the lightning arrow and finally disintegrated.

Si Liuhe felt an intense pain. His body felt being hit by a heavy hammer, and he was sent flying backward, blood spurting out of his mouth.

Everyone was silent. The strength that both Dean Lei and Si Liuhe unleashed had far surpassed the ordinary True Saint.

Everyone knew that these were not their trump cards. Once they unleashed their true trump cards, the entire world would probably be destroyed!

“Dean Lei’s strength seems stronger than Si Liuhe’s,” someone thought. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“He is an old monster, after all. It is not strange that Si Liuhe could not win.”

“If Si Liuhe hadn’t integrated many types of dao techniques, he would have died in Dean Lei’s hands long ago.”

Si Liuhe, standing not far away, frowned as well. He wiped away the blood from the corner of his mouth, and his face seemed unwilling to give up.

As a proud son of heaven, he was naturally unwilling to admit defeat.

“Si Liuhe, you are no match for me.” At this moment, Dean Lei stroked his beard and mocked.

Si Liuhe’s expression turned cold. He raised his hand and shouted, “That’s because you haven’t seen the secret technique of my Si family!”

“Didn’t I receive the inheritance of my ancestors?” Dean Lei sneered. “Fight me if you want to!”

Just as tensions rose between the two, Yan Tianshi, not far away, frowned and said, “Don’t waste any more time. Let’s attack together and end this quickly.”

After hearing Yan Tianshi’s words, numerous True Saints stood up.

One, two, three!

A total of nine True Saints!

Although Dean Lei was strong, he could not possibly win against nine True Saints!

What was worse was that Si Liuhe was involved. His strength was unfathomable, and with the help of nine True Saints, the chances of Dean Lei winning this battle were slim!

“Dean Lei… Don’t worry about me…” Qin Yu could not bear to watch Dean Lei fight against ten people alone. He opened his mouth and tried his best to signal Dean Lei to leave.

Dean Lei was not afraid at all. He shouted, “Bring it on! I want to see if the ten of you can really do anything to me!”

“I, alone, am enough!” Si Liuhe shouted. As a chosen one, he definitely did not want to fight together with others. However, since Yan Tianshi had spoken, he could only fight with the nine True Saints.

A great battle was about to break out. The True Saint dared not hold back at all. They attacked together and charged toward Dean Lei!

Lightning danced in the air, and dark cracks spread wildly in the distortion as if they wanted to devour the world.

Every True Saint unleashed their power to the extreme. The power was like a vast torrent that gathered together and rushed toward Dean Lei!
