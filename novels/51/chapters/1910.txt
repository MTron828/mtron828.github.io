1911 The Vicious Third Princess

An intense pain came from his face instantly.

The third princess rubbed Qin Yu’s face roughly. Her hands stained with blood, but it did not stop her.

Qin Yu could clearly hear the cracking sound coming from his face. Fortunately, Qin Yu’s bones were tremendously hard and were not broken by her.

When the people in the surroundings saw this brutal scene, they turned their faces to the other side, one after another. They seemed unwilling to continue watching.

!!

Qin Yu gritted his teeth and didn’t make a sound. He also didn’t even try to resist.

After a long time, the third princess seemed tired and stopped what she was doing.

While wiping away the blood on Qin Yu’s body, she mumbled, “You’re pretty good. You didn’t even utter a sound. It seems like you’re different from the others.”

Qin Yu didn’t say anything. He closed his eyes slightly as if he was at her mercy.

Since he had come to Xihuang Islan, Qin Yu was well-prepared. Naturally, he was not afraid at all.

The third princess sized up Qin Yu and said with a smile, “You look slightly better now, but you’re rather boring. I’ll just kill you.”

After saying that, the third princess’s palm shook, and a sword appeared in her hand.

It was an incredibly terrifying sword. As soon as it was drawn out, one could see waves of light surging, shaking the surrounding void to distort.

Qin Yu could clearly feel the traces of Holy Power coming from the sword.

“A Saint Weapon.” Qin Yu frowned.

They were indeed generous, as expected of the Yan family. They could casually take out a Saint Weapon.

“Third Princess, you must not do this,” someone at the side walked over and cautioned her.

“He was sent here to guard Xihuang Island. Thus we can’t take his life,” the others also stepped forward and said.

The third princess snorted and then said unhappily, “It’s so troublesome…”

Sizing up Qin Yu, she was as if thinking of some devious ideas.

The third princess said with a smile, “Why don’t you be my dog? How about it? After all, you’re no different from a guard dog if I keep you on this Island.”

Qin Yu remained silent. His eyes were still slightly closed.

“Come,” the third Princess continued. “Call me Lord, and I’ll let you go if you do.”

Qin Yu still didn’t speak as if he didn’t hear her.

“I’m giving you a chance now!” the third Princess was furious and said. “Do you agree?”

Qin Yu glanced at her and sneered, “Don’t even think about it,”

The third princess’s face darkened. She looked at Qin Yu coldly and said, “I’ll break your limbs and teeth if you disagree. Let’s see how long you can keep this up!”

“As long as you don’t kill me, don’t even think about it,” Qin Yu said coldly.

Seeing what happened, the people by the side hurriedly came forward and admonished him, “Just do as the third princess wishes. At least you’ll suffer less, right?”

Qin Yu didn’t say anything. There was no fear on his face which had been severely damaged.

“F*ck!” The third princess was furious. She flipped her palm and took out a golden chain.

The third princess waved her hand, and the chain tied around Qin Yu’s neck!

Qin Yu furrowed his brows tightly. Before he could come to his senses, he felt a sharp pain along the chain!

The intense pain spread throughout his body rapidly. Not only that, but a terrifying internal qi was also pressing toward Qin Yu’s primordial spirit!

Qin Yu did not dare to be negligent. He hurriedly activated his primordial spirit to resist the force.

In his mind, two golden radiances were colliding non-stop.

The two forces were equally matched and seemed to be in a stalemate.

Qin Yu sweated profusely. His face covered with sweat, and he was in great pain.

“Hmph! It won’t take long before you’re willing to be a watchdog. When that time comes, I will plant my will into your mind,” the third princess said proudly.

Upon hearing this, Qin Yu’s expression changed slightly.

He didn’t dare to be negligent. He held his breath in deep concentration, trying his best to resist the force. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

The third Princess patted Qin Yu’s head and said with a smile, “Perform well, and I might give you two more bones to eat.”

After saying this, the third princess turned to a Semi-Saint beside her and said, “From tomorrow onward, break one of his fingers a day.”

The Semi-Saint beside her bowed slightly and said, “Noted, Third Princess.”

The third princess didn’t stay long. She turned and then left.

At this time, the palace not far away had slowly been restored. The third princess brought everyone back to the palace.

“Young man, don’t think about resisting. Listen to the third princess so that you will suffer less. Otherwise, you should leave the Yan family as soon as possible to avoid losing your life,” The Semi-Saint reminded.

Qin Yu didn’t say anything. Cold sweat was dripping from his forehead, and he was trying his best to resist.

Fortunately, Qin Yu’s primordial spirit had become much stronger after devouring primordial spirits. Otherwise, it would have been eroded by the force.

Qin Yu did not know what the chains were, but the terrifying power they exuded was attacking his primordial spirit. Even he could not resist it anymore.

For a whole day and night, Qin Yu could not break free from the control of the chains.

The other end of the chain led to the palace. It was tied to the throne of the third princess.

The following day, the Semi-Saint came to Xihuang Island as requested by the third princess.

Looking at Qin Yu sitting cross-legged in front of him, he was somewhat surprised.

“You have some ability,” the Semi-Saint touched his chin and said in a low voice.

...

No one could last a day and a night under this chain, especially in a place like Xihuang Island.

The Semi-Saint put his hand on the chain.

Through the chain, the Semi-Saint could see Qin Yu’s primordial spirit directly.

When he saw the confrontation between the two forces, the surprise in his eyes intensified.

“The power of the primordial spirit is so strong,” the Semi-Saint said in a low voice.

Then, he shook his head and said, “Unfortunately, it was just a stubborn resistance in the end.”

The Semi-Saint didn’t say anything else. As instructed by the third princess, he broke one of Qin Yu’s fingers and returned to the palace.

In the palace, the third princess was sitting on her throne with her legs crossed. She was gnawing on an immortal fruit from somewhere, looking very pleased.

In front of her, a bunch of people was dancing with all their might. There were both men and women, and everyone was performing extremely unsightly movements. Anyone who saw them would feel tremendously uncomfortable, but only the third princess seemed very interested.

The Semi-Saint walked up to the third princess and took out Qin Yu’s finger.

“Third Princess, this is the finger of the kid from Xihuang Island,” the Semi-Saint said.

...

“Oh.” The third princess didn’t even look at it and just threw it into the trash.
