2213 The Holy Region Aristocratic Family Again

A young man in white clothes had a cold and stern expression, holding a long sword in his hand.

This person was fair and handsome, but his expression was tremendously indifferent as if he had no emotions.

“This person is very strong!”

Qin Yu’s pupils slightly constricted. Even if this person did not move, he could still feel the dangerous sharpness on his body.

Facing him resembled facing a sword that could stab at him at any moment, and it caused Qin Yu’s hair to stand on end.

“Does this person have an alliance with Demonic Beasts?”

The young man did not reply to Qin Yu. He turned to look at the middle-aged man beside him.

“This black-striped tiger traded his demon core for his life to make a deal with this young man.”

The middle-aged man shook his head.

Qin Yu frowned. It seemed that his every move could not escape the middle-aged man’s eyes.

The damage to his divine sense had a significant impact on him.

“If you conspire with the demon race, I will definitely kill you.”

The young man said indifferently.

“I, Qin Yu, will do whatever I want to do. Don’t tell me what to do.”

Qin Yu said coldly.

“Heh, by all means, you can try.”

The young man said.

Watching the three of them leave, Qin Yu forcefully suppressed his anger.

He felt that this black-striped Tiger King was like a human cultivator, or even purer.

Qin Yu shook his head to discard the messy thoughts out of his head.

He sat cross-legged on the ground. The demonic qi entered his body like a whirlwind, tempering his body.

This was the advantage of having a chaotic body. He could cultivate anywhere.

Although the demonic qi had little effect on the recovery of the divine soul, it was better than nothing.

In less than half a day, under Qin Yu’s overbearing absorption, the demonic qi here was soon depleted.

The Saintly Body Technique indeed consumed a terrifying amount of spiritual energy. When he advanced from the first-grade True Saint to the second stage, he had consumed 3,000 or so spiritual essence from the Solitary Cloud City. His body absorbed 80% of this terrifying amount of spiritual energy. Under the tempering of this massive amount of spiritual energy, his physical body became increasingly shimmering with an eerie luster.

Qin Yu did not know how strong his physical body was now.

Qin Yu was just about to leave when he was suddenly attracted by a pearl emitting a green internal qi.

With a thought, he entered it, and four spaces were inside.

There was a space of spiritual sense, a space of demonic qi, a space of death qi, and a space of unknown internal qi Qin Yu could not tell.

When his spiritual sense entered the demonic qi space, his entire body instantly emanated a soaring demonic qi.

When he entered the death qi space, his entire person was ghastly as if he had come from the underworld.

“This is a good treasure to conceal internal qi. It is many times better than the green hat that Wu Mei gave me.”

Qin Yu was indescribably delighted. This black-striped Tiger King had indeed collected some treasures after so many years.

As for the other internal qi, Qin Yu frowned and studied it for a long time but could not figure it out.

“Forget it. Let’s not worry about it for now. Chang Hu and the others will be anxious to wait too long.”

Qin Yu shook his head and exited this Tiger King’s cave abode.

When he arrived at the area earlier, the three were nowhere to be seen. Qin Yu’s nose twitched.

Other than the black-striped tiger’s blood, there seemed to be another bloody smell.

“You’re finally here, kid.”

A sinister laugh came from behind the tree.

“Ta Shan.”

Qin Yu frowned.

Another burly man dragged Feng and Wu Mei out from behind the forest.

Feng’s legs and hands were broken, and his body was connected to his body at a strange angle.

Wu Mei was ravaged beyond recognition, while Chang Hu was lying on the ground, his fate unknown.

“Haha, it’s your turn now.”

The burly man kicked the two out before throwing a punch at Qin Yu.

Almost at the same time, Ta Shan leaped high into the air and clenched his fists together before smashing them on Qin Yu’s head.

“Boom!”

Qin Yu grabbed a fist with each hand and kicked the man’s neck, breaking his neck straight away.

“Just this?”

Qin Yu sneered.

“I’ve already said that this person’s body isn’t simple. Don’t hold back.”

Ta Shan sneered and said.

The aura on his body exploded, and the aura of a fourth-grade True Saint erupted.

In a swift motion, his body turned into afterimages, delivering hundreds of punches in a mere second, blasting Qin Yu’s body.

“Haha, your divine sense is damaged and you can’t even see my position? Don’t worry. I’m going to torture you today.”

Ta Shan laughed heartily. He coldly looked at Qin Yu, who was dripping blood from the corner of his mouth.

He was somewhat frightened deep down. This time, he did not hold back. Even an adult giant bear would turn into meat paste with these 100 or so punches, but Qin Yu only suffered a slight injury.

How terrifying would his strength be if his divine sense were not damaged?

“Just this? Even if I stand still and let you hit me for two hours, you can’t do anything to me.”

Qin Yu sneered and said.

“Brat, you’re courting death. Take this move of mine and experience my heavy punch.”

Ta Shan was furious.

His fist smashed toward Qin Yu. At this moment, the wind from his fist actually carried a trace of ripples.

The punch landed, and the loud sound was like a giant hammer beating a drum.

In an instant, dozens of punches landed on Qin Yu’s body. Qin Yu took a step back and spat a mouthful of blood.

He sneered and said.

“You dare to call this the rules with just a trace of the power of heaven and earth?” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Compared to Xing Xiu’s space of the way, this was even simply inferior to a tadpole.

However, Ta Shan’s violent attack still caused him some impact.

Suddenly, Qin Yu’s entire body floated.

From top to bottom, he felt the world spinning. He bent down to take a look and saw his body still in the same place.

However, his golden figurine was grabbed by a strange white hand.

“You didn’t expect this, did you? I’m soul-cultivating, hahaha!”

The person Qin Yu broke his neck earlier sneered.

An immense white figure hugged Qin Yu, and Qin Yu hurriedly resisted it using his divine sense.

“Come to my domain, the sea of soul. You’ll be reduced to ashes here and become fertilizer for my domain.”

Suddenly, Qin Yu was pulled into a green space by the silver-white little person.

An indescribable sense of suffocation spread throughout Qin Yu’s divine sense. Hundreds of little people with soaring resentment madly tore and bit Qin Yu’s divine sense.

“These are the resentment left by the cultivators who died in my spiritual space.”

The man with soul-cultivating cultivation laughed with a sinister and mocking tone and said.

“Let’s see if you’re still that tough after your soul and body are separated!”

At this moment, Ta Shan punched Qin Yu’s chest, causing him to spit out a mouthful of blood uncontrollably.

“The Si family and the Yao family seemed to have overestimated you. They used the people in the Skywater Prison to threaten everyone. I thought you were at the Peak of True Saint, but you seem to be just so-so.”

Ta Shan laughed heartily.

“The Holy Region again?”

Qin Yu said coldly. The nine great aristocratic families were really persistent. They could still trace him even though he had come to this remote galaxy.

“The Si family and the Yao family of the Holy Region sent me a message. They want to exchange your head for my family members in the Skywater Prison. If they can get your head, they can even let my family join the aristocratic families and cultivate the cultivation techniques of the aristocratic families of the Holy Region.”
