Chapter 931: Chapter 931, stealing spirit stones

The white bone stretched out its skinny palm and grabbed Uncle Otter!

Uncle Otter’s expression changed drastically. He hurriedly activated the internal Qi in his body in an attempt to break free.

But at this moment, he realized that the power of the white bone was terrifying! There was no chance of breaking free!

Before Uncle Otter could react, a huge force was already transmitted over!

Under everyone’s watchful eyes, Uncle Otter’s body was actually forcefully torn into two halves!

Everyone could not help but gasp!

To raise his hand and tear apart a martial saint, what kind of method was this?

At the Instant Uncle Otter was torn apart, Uncle Otter’s nascent soul also flew out from his spiritual sense.

He stood in the air, his expression extremely ugly.

Although he could still recover after losing his physical body, his vitality would be greatly damaged, and it would be difficult to recover for many years!

It would even affect his cultivation foundation in the future!

“Who are you people...”uncle otter said weakly.

Tian Xuehong glanced at Uncle Otter’s nascent soul and narrowed his eyes as he said, “You are a person who is about to die. Why are you talking so much nonsense?”

When he heard this, Uncle Otter’s expression immediately changed! He

He turned around and planned to escape, but Tian Xuehong would not give him the chance!

The Sky Blood Rainbow stretched out his palm, and a blood-red light that was like a cage restrained Uncle Otter’s nascent soul!

Uncle Otter was completely flustered!

If his nascent soul was gone, then everything would really be gone!

“Young Master Gu, save me!”Uncle Otter shouted desperately.

Gu Xinghe’s expression was also not very good. He said in a deep voice, “Friend, we can talk after this is over. On account of me and the Jingdu Martial Arts Association, spare his life, how about it?”

However, Tian Xuehong shook his head and said, “I don’t need to give you face.”

After saying this, Tian Xuehong extended his palm again, and uncle Otter’s nascent soul fell directly into his palm!

Immediately after, Tian Xuehong opened his mouth and swallowed Uncle Otter’s nascent soul into his stomach!

A satisfied expression appeared on his face, but in the eyes of everyone, it was extremely horrifying!

To kill a martial saint with just a raise of his hand, what kind of ability was this! !

The scene was completely silent, not even daring to breathe loudly.

Gu Xinghe took a deep breath, stood up and asked, “Who exactly are you?”

Tian Xuehong glanced at Gu Xinghe and said indifferently, “It seems that all of you are very curious. Alright, then I might as well tell you.”

“I come from the Slaughter Immortal sect. I was born from the evil spirits, of course, including my white bone army.”

“Back then, the masked woman slaughtered tens of thousands of people from the immortal massacre sect in one go, causing evil spirits to emerge from the sect. And I was born by Luck.”

At this point, the Sky Blood Rainbow seemed to have thought of something.

He patted his head and said, “Oh, speaking of which, it’s all thanks to someone called Qin Yu. I really have to thank him.”

“If it weren’t for him taking away the masked woman’s coffin, I’m afraid we would never have been born. hahahaha!”

Hearing this, Qin Yu, who was hiding in the dark, had a drastic change in expression!

He never expected that the Sky Blood Rainbow was released by him unintentionally!

“The massacre immortal sect... you said you came from the Massacre Immortal sect? The number one sect in the World Ten Thousand Years Ago?”Gu Xinghe frowned.

“That’s right.”The Sky Blood Rainbow put his hands behind his back.

Everyone couldn’t help but gasp!

Most of them had never heard of the Massacre Immortal sect.

However, Zhuang Teng, Yao Meng, and the others were not unfamiliar with the massacre immortal sect.

This was because they had once read about it in the ancient books of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association!

“It’s rumored that the weakest person in the Massacre Immortal sect is at the Almighty Realm. In other words, the bones in his hands are all the bones of Almighty Experts!”

“No wonder he has such power! He can even slaughter a martial saint easily!”

“Oh no, his army of white bones is enough to sweep through everything in the world!”

Gu Xinghe naturally realized this problem.

He walked forward and said in a low voice, “Sir, there is no enmity between us. Why don’t we sit down and have a good talk?”

Tian Xuehong raised his brows and said with a cold smile, “Back then, I sent my people to the Jingdu Martial Arts Association and wanted to cooperate with you. Unfortunately, you rejected them and humiliated him. You haven’t forgotten, have you?”

Gu Xinghe’s expression became more and more unsightly.

At that time, how could he have known that Tian Xuehong’s background was so big!

“Alright, no need to say anything more,”Tian Xuehong said quietly.

“You don’t have to be afraid. I Won’t act Rashly. Of course, this spirit stone mine belongs to me.”

“If anyone is unconvinced, you can step forward now.”

The scene was quiet. No one dared to say anything.

Tian Xuehong nodded slightly and said, “Then I won’t stand on ceremony.” ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“Wait!”

At this moment, Gu Xinghe hurriedly stopped Tian Xuehong.

“If you don’t mind, why don’t you come to my residence and have a chat?”Gu Xinghe said.

Tian Xuehong thought for a moment and said, “It’s said that in the martial arts world nowadays, it’s up to you, right?”

“That’s right.”Gu Xinghe quickly nodded.

Tian Xuehong touched his chin and said in a low voice, “Maybe we can really use you guys... Alright, I’ll see what you have to say for now.”

Seeing this, Gu Xinghe was immediately overjoyed and quickly said, “Sir, Please!”

Under everyone’s gaze, the two of them left the place.

“Gu Xinghe... What will he talk to him about?”

“What else can he talk about? He’s in cahoots with us.”

“No matter what we talk about, we definitely won’t gain anything.”

“Perhaps we should think of a countermeasure.”

The martial artists of this era were all extremely worried and sorrowful. Everyone knew very well that the negotiation between the strong and the strong would always sacrifice the weak.

“Senior Xu, Are You Alright?”Qin Yu walked quickly to Xu Huaigu’s side.

Xu Huaigu waved his hand slightly and said, “I’m fine.”

Qin Yu sighed and said, “Senior Xu, you should quickly go to the Divine Alchemist Pavilion and rest well.”

Xu Huaigu remained silent and only bowed slightly to Qin Yu.

At this moment, Qin Yu suddenly noticed a sneaky figure.

That figure was none other than the handlebar mustache.

He sneaked out of the venue and ran away as soon as he left.

Seeing this, Qin Yu hurriedly said goodbye to Xu Huaigu and hurriedly followed him.

After catching up with the man with the handlebar mustache, Qin Yu patted his shoulder and said, “Where are you going?”

The man with the handlebar mustache widened his eyes and said, “Where the F * CK Can I Go? Didn’t you hear what they said? That Dog wants the entire spiritual stone mine!”

“I have to steal the spiritual stone before he goes!”

Qin Yu’s eyes lit up and he said hurriedly, “Good Idea!”
