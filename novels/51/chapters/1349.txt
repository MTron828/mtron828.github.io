Chapter 1350: Chapter 1,350, the legend of the Guardian 

“The Guardian?”Wen Wanfu frowned. “Are you talking about the guardian of the treasure?”

“No.”Qin Yu scratched his head and said, “I don’t know how to explain it to you. Anyway, people call him the guardian of the Dao...”

“You’re probably talking about the guardian of a certain region,”Jue Wu suddenly said.

Qin Yu was stunned. He looked at Jue Wu in surprise and said, “You actually know about it?”

Jue Wu said proudly, “How is it? You Little Meat Cushion, do you know my ability now?”

“Screw you, hurry up and say it,”Qin Yu urged.

Jue Wu didn’t say too much nonsense. She held her chin and said, “I’ve only heard rumors about the guardian of the Dao, but I’ve never seen it before.”

“It’s said that most of the dao guardians are very powerful and can protect the people in the starry sky to prevent someone from breaking the Dao. Of course, these are all legends. It’s not certain whether there are any dao guardians or not.”

“There definitely are!”Qin Yu blurted out.

Jue Wu rolled her eyes at Qin Yu and said, “You Little Brat, what do you know?”

Qin Yu was not in the mood to joke with her. Instead, she asked anxiously, “How can I become a Dao Guardian?”

Jue Wu thought for a moment and said, “According to the rumors, a dao protector can only be chosen. In other words, basically all dao protectors are destined at birth.”

“Chosen?”Qin Yu frowned even more.

Who was the chosen one? Was it the Heavenly Dao?

“It is said that most dao protectors lead an extremely painful life. From birth, they are thrown into the cycle of reincarnation to cultivate and suffer a lot,”said Jue Wu.

“Because of their identity, most of them will live a lonely life.”

Hearing her words, Qin Yu felt extremely uncomfortable.

In other words, from the moment her father was born, he was thrown into the cycle of reincarnation to experience bitter cultivation in order to obtain a top-notch cultivation...

Previously, Qin Yu had always felt that she was very wronged. However, at this moment, Qin Yu suddenly realized that the suffering she suffered was nothing compared to her father.

“Can’t they marry and have children?”Qin Yu asked with a frown. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Jue Wu shook her head and said, “I heard that they can’t.”

“Then... what happens if they give birth?”Qin Yu asked carefully.

“I heard that they will be punished by the Heavenly Dao. As for what kind of punishment, I’m not too sure,”Jue Wu muttered.

“In short, I’ve heard people say before that basically all the Guardians of the Dao have no feelings to speak of. Usually, things like marrying and having children won’t happen.”

Qin Yu sat there in a daze, feeling extremely sad.

At this moment, all of his complaints towards his father had vanished into thin air.

“Aiya, just treat it as a story. Anyway, we don’t know whether it’s true or not.”Jue Wu waved her hand and said.

At this moment, Qin Yu suddenly stood up and said in a deep voice, “Jue Wu, help me find my life force. Please.”

Jue Wu rolled her eyes and said, “I’m eating. What’s wrong with you?”

Qin Yu gritted his teeth and knelt down on one knee, saying, “Please.”

Seeing this scene, Jue Wu and Wen Wanyi couldn’t help but look at each other.

They seemed to find it hard to understand Qin Yu’s abnormal behavior.

“Okay, okay. I didn’t say I wouldn’t help you,”Jue Wu picked up a piece of cake from the table and stuffed it into her mouth as she muttered.

Qin Yu stood up from the ground and took a deep breath. He tried his best to suppress the emotions that were about to burst out from his heart and try his best to maintain his calm.

“By the way, why are you asking about this?”Jue Wu asked with some suspicion.

Qin Yu shook his head and lied, “I’m just asking.”

“What about the Yan family? Why are you asking about the Yan Family?”Jue Wu continued to ask.

At this time, Wen wanji coughed and said, “Although I don’t know much about the rumors about the Guardians of the Dao, I know the Yan family very well.”

“The Yan family of the Central Plains is one of the nine great aristocratic families. It is also the most powerful representative of the current Holy Region.”

Qin Yu smiled bitterly and said, “Forget it. I don’t want to ask about it now. Those things are too far away for me.”

“What’s so far away!”Jue Wu said with her eyes wide open.

“Little meat cushion, you are so young, but you have such cultivation. In the future, you will definitely not be inferior to those sons and Sons of the Central Plains!”

“That’s right.”Wen wanyi also agreed with this.

“The number one genius of the Southern Plains was killed by you with two punches. A genius is nothing extraordinary.”

Qin Yu acknowledged and said with some gratitude, “Thank you, seniors.”

“TSK tsk, I’m not used to you calling me senior all of a sudden,”jue wu whispered.

Qin Yu said jokingly, “Okay, then I’ll call you a brat from now on.”

“Don’t You Dare!”

“I’ll call you a Brat!”

“I’ll beat you to death!”

“... you’ll call me that even if you beat me to death!”

...

Time flew by quickly. The time of the myriad sect meeting was set to be three days later.

And the location was the great Yue mountain.

The Great Yue Mountain was the former residence of Da Yue. Ever since he passed away, the great Yue mountain had become the venue for many important meetings.

“I think the people from the Heavenly Cloud sect will definitely come to this ten thousand sect gathering, right?”Qin Yu asked tentatively.

“Since it’s the ten thousand sect gathering, the Heavenly Cloud Sect, the number one sect in the South Province, will naturally come,”said Wen Wanyi.

Juewu, who was at the side, bared her fangs and brandished her claws as she said, “What are you afraid of? As my little meat cushion, they won’t dare to do anything to you!”
