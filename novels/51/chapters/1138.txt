Chapter 1139: Chapter 1,139, the descent of the higher-ups! 

Seeing Yao Qing’s serious appearance, Qin Yu and the other two exchanged glances.

“You are the only one who has seen the Dao Protector. What do you think? Does he look like one?”Zhai Xing looked at Pavilion Master.

Pavilion master sized up Yao Qing in front of him and said, “His aura is a bit lacking. The Dao Protector has a natural disposition.”

“That’s right.”Qin Yu also nodded slightly.

Although he had never seen him in person, he had seen him more than once in his divine sense.

“However... the difference isn’t too big. If you haven’t seen him before, you shouldn’t be able to tell that something is fishy.”At this moment, Qin Yu changed the topic.

Pavilion Master had the same thoughts regarding this.

Although there was a difference, as long as Yao Qing didn’t play the Fool, no one should suspect him.

“I have to say, your brain is pretty good.”Qin Yu hit Yao Qing on the chest.

Yao Qing said proudly, “Of course!”

“Then it’s settled. I’ll leave this matter to you.”Zhai Xing looked at Yao Qing.

Yao Qing hurriedly nodded and said, “Okay, but if the performance fails, don’t blame me.”

“As long as you’re not nervous, the performance shouldn’t fail,”pavilion master said.

Qin Yu said jokingly, “He’s so thick-skinned, he won’t be nervous.”

With Yao Qing’s countermeasure, Qin Yu was indeed relieved.

It was definitely not a wise choice to fight with eight higher-ups now, but it had to be said that at this moment, Qin Yu was looking forward to the opening of the Holy Region.

Because as long as the holy region was opened, Qin Yu would have the chance to meet Yan Ruoxue, the person whom he had been longing for day and night.

Qin Yu subconsciously took out the jade pendant and kissed it lightly.

In fact, if Qin Yu crushed the jade pendant, he might have escaped death, but... Qin Yu didn’t want to let the Yan family help him, and he didn’t want to disappoint Yan Ruoxue.

After returning to the main hall, Qin Yu asked Yao Qing to leave for the time being, waiting for an opportunity to make a move.

As for Qin Yu, Pavilion Master, and the others, they were quietly waiting for the arrival of the eight higher-ups.

At this moment, many people had already arrived upon hearing the news. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

They all knew that the holy region was about to open, and everyone wanted to see the opening of the Holy Region.

When evening arrived, Yao Meng, Chang Mang, and the others had also arrived.

During this period of time, they had relied on the strange flowers that they had obtained from the Cloud Dragon Island to enter closed-door cultivation. Under the effects of the three strange flowers, their internal Qi had increased.

“How is it? Can you feel the aura of an intermediate martial saint?”Qin Yu looked at Yao Meng and asked casually.

Yao Meng smiled and said, “If there are three more, it should be more or less the same.”

“That’s right, but the effects of these three strange flowers are indeed beyond our imagination.”Zhuang Teng who was at the side also said.

When Qin Yu heard this, he could not help but sigh in his heart.

According to Yao Meng, they only needed six strange flowers to step into the intermediate stage of the martial saint stage.

However, Qin Yu had spent dozens of flowers to barely touch the edge of the intermediate stage of the martial saint stage.

There are gains and losses in life. The chaotic body gave Qin Yu a powerful physical body. At the same time, it also made his cultivation much more difficult than the others.

Qin Yu glanced at Xiao Yuan and realized that this person’s aura was extremely hazy. It was as if he had used some secret technique to conceal his internal Qi.

At this rate, these people’s realms would surpass Qin Yu sooner or later.

This also increased the pressure on Qin Yu.

If he didn’t want to be left behind, he could only put in more effort.

“According to Tianjizi’s words, the Holy Region will open tomorrow,”Xiao Yuan sighed slightly.

“Yeah, I really want to take a look at the legendary Holy Region,”the others also said.

Qin Yu didn’t say anything. In reality, the one who was most anxious was Qin Yu.

Hopefully, nothing will happen to Yao Qing Tomorrow, Qin Yu thought to himself.

In order to prevent the news from leaking out, only the four of them knew about this.

Even Chang Mang didn’t know anything about this.

Time flew by.

The next morning, the crack in the passageway grew even larger. It looked like it was the size of a bucket!

This size was enough to support the descent of the eight high-ranking officials!

Zhai Xing and the pavilion master arrived at the crack in the tunnel early in the morning.

Looking at the crack that was about to collapse, a trace of worry flashed across their faces.

“Don’t stand here anymore.”At this time, Zhai Xing suddenly said.

“Those eight high-ranking officials might directly kill us when they appear.”

Pavilion master nodded. Then, he returned to his room with Zhai Xing.

The second secret realm was full of people.

Many people were waiting for the legendary holy region to open.

“Holy region, we can finally see the legendary holy region.”

“Don’t be happy too early. You have to know that high-level civilizations always slaughter low-level civilizations.”

“Before the opening of the Holy Region, no one knows what kind of existence they are and what kind of personality they have.”

Just as everyone was discussing, a loud sound suddenly came from the depths of the second secret realm!

The sound was like the roar of a dragon and tiger, deafening and deafening, as if thousands of soldiers and horses had crossed the border in an instant!

The entire second secret realm shook as if the world was about to collapse. Countless pillars fell from the hall at any moment!

In the depths of the second mystic realm, a blinding light tore through the sky!

The seal was completely shattered!

“What a blinding light!”

“I feel like... I’m going blind!”

“Is the sun setting?”

Many people covered their eyes and peeked through the gaps in their hands.

Those who couldn’t Dodge in time were blinded by the light and lost their light for a short period of time!

Eight people slowly walked out from the light.

These eight people looked down from above, domineering, and had the power to Swallow Mountains and rivers!

Their natural imposing manner and the indifferent expressions on their faces made people involuntarily have the thought of worshipping them!

And their astonishing eyes swept over the second secret realm as if they were looking down on a bunch of ants!

The True Masters of the Martial Arts Association of Jingdu, the eight high-ranking officials, were born!
