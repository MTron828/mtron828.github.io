Chapter 881: Chapter 881: Yan Ruoxue Awakens!

This was the spirit binding spell that Qin Yu had been longing for! Now that it was in his hands, Qin Yu even felt that it was a little unreal!

He did not waste any time and immediately rushed towards the Divine Alchemist Pavilion.

At this moment, Gu Xinghe had already been brought back to the second mystic realm.

In the mystic realm, Gu Zizhen was both angry and a little distressed.

“Didn’t I say that you are not allowed to fight with him! It’s just a few days, can’t you hold it in? !”Gu Zizhen couldn’t help but scold.

Gu Xinghe gritted his teeth and said, “That Qin Yu is full of foul language, how can I tolerate him! If I let him scold me, then where will my face go? !”

“Face? You still know how to care about face?”Gu Zizhen was so angry that he laughed.

“In the end? You were beaten half to death with one punch, and you have your face? Our second mystic realm’s face has been completely thrown away by you alone!”

At the mention of this matter, Gu Xinghe was full of anger.

“I was careless...”Gu Xinghe clenched his fists tightly.

This failure had undoubtedly caused Gu Xinghe to lose all his face.

“Dad, no matter what, I have to fight him again!”Gu Xinghe said unwillingly.

Gu Zizhen said coldly, “Now, things have gone beyond our control. He has already taken away the spirit binding spell. What else do you want to Do?”

Gu Xinghe opened his mouth and wanted to say something, but was interrupted by Gu Zizhen.

“Because of you, the higher-ups are already very unhappy. They have given a death order. As soon as a martial saint successfully breaks through, they will immediately send out a martial saint to kill Qin Yu,”Gu Zizhen said coldly.

Gu Xinghe hurriedly said, “Then I will lead the team!”

“You can stay in the second secret realm,”gu Zizhen said coldly.

“I won’t!”Gu Xinghe was extremely stubborn.

“I can’t come back so dejectedly. I want to go back to the Jingdu Martial Arts Association.”

Gu Zizhen really wanted to refuse, but Gu Xinghe was extremely stubborn.

Helpless, Gu Zizhen could only nod and say, “I can let you go back, but before the martial saint comes into being, you can’t do anything.”

“Okay!”Gu Xinghe hurriedly agreed.

To Gu Xinghe, as long as he could return to the Jingdu Martial Arts Association, he was willing to agree to anything.

“Bear with it, it won’t take more than a week.”Gu Zizhen patted Gu Xinghe’s shoulder.

“When that time comes, a martial saint will kill Qin Yu and bring Yan Ruoxue back!”

...

On the other side, Qin Yu was holding the spirit binding spell as he hurriedly ran back to the medicine God Pavilion.

As soon as he entered the door, Qin Yu couldn’t wait to ask, “Pavilion Master, where is Ruoxue?”

“She’s in the secret room. What’s Wrong?”The Pavilion Master couldn’t help but feel puzzled.

Qin Yu’s hands trembled as he said, “Spirit binding spell... I’ve got the spirit binding spell!”

Hearing this, a trace of surprise flashed across the pavilion master’s face.

“You traded Gu Xinghe for it?”The pavilion master tried to ask.

Qin Yu nodded, “Yes, that’s why I’m looking for Gu Xinghe.”

At this point, Qin Yu waved his hand and said, “Don’t waste time, take me to the secret room quickly.” Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Qin Yu couldn’t wait to see Yan Ruoxue after she woke up.

The pavilion master said helplessly, “Even if you have the spirit binding technique, you still need time to comprehend it. Don’t tell me you plan to use this book to save her?”

Qin Yu was stunned. He patted his head and said awkwardly, “I was too excited and forgot about it...”

“Pavilion Master, give me half a day.”Qin Yu hurriedly greeted the pavilion master and then turned back to his elder’s residence.

Seeing Qin Yu’s anxious look, Zhang Yi Jiu couldn’t help but frown.

“Is there a need to be so excited? What’s so good about this Yan Ruoxue...”Zhang Yi Jiu muttered softly.

...

In the Elder’s residence.

Qin Yu sat cross-legged on the bed. In front of him was the spirit binding technique.

With Qin Yu’s talent, it did not take him long to comprehend a cultivation technique. Even if it was a heaven-tier cultivation technique, it would only take him a few hours at most.

However, Qin Yu’s mind could not calm down at the moment. This also caused the time for him to comprehend to grow longer.

Time passed by minute by second. After a full five hours, Qin Yu finally opened his eyes.

He let out a long breath, and his eyes suddenly opened.

“This spirit binding technique... it really is a mysterious technique,”Qin Yu could not help but mutter.

After comprehending the spirit binding technique, Qin Yu realized how terrifying this spirit binding technique was.

This technique could not only cause one’s spiritual sense to fall into eternal sleep, it could even control the spiritual sense of others and sign an unequal contract with them.

Fortunately, Yan Ruoxue’s spiritual sense had only fallen into eternal slumber. If her spiritual sense was forced to sign a contract, then only the caster would have a way to undo it.

Qin Yu walked out of the Elder’s residence and arrived at the Pavilion Master’s building in a flash.

At this moment, the pavilion master and the two apprentice alchemists were waiting here, and the door of the Secret Chamber had long been opened.

Qin Yu took a deep breath and quickly walked into the secret chamber, squatting on one side of the medicinal pool.

In the medicinal pool, Yan Ruoxue was still flawless. Her snow-white skin and thick black hair were soaked in the medicinal bath. A charming smell of internal qi and medicinal fragrance floated into the air.

Even though Yan Ruoxue was currently in a coma, her charm did not diminish. Instead, it added a hint of weakness, making people feel protective.

Qin Yu gently grabbed Yan Ruoxue’s hand and said in a low voice, “Ruoxue, we can finally be together...”

Qin Yu had waited for so long for this day!

He did not waste any more time and immediately began to activate the spirit binding spell.

Qin Yu’s hands flickered with a faint light and hung above Yan Ruoxue’s head.

Threads of strange light were like water ripples, slowly circulating under Qin Yu’s hands.

This aura was like a thin veil, covering Yan Ruoxue’s delicate body. Threads of internal Qi flowed through her fine pores and entered her body.

Qin Yu was extremely nervous. Beside him, the pavilion master’s face could not help but become a little worried.

“Weng!”

Following a slight sound, a golden light flashed across Yan Ruoxue’s forehead!

This golden light was like a blooming flower, slowly spreading from her forehead!

Qin Yu retracted his palm.

He looked at Yan Ruoxue in front of him nervously, his heart hanging in the air.

Qin Yu clenched his fist tightly, his eyes staring at Yan Ruoxue.

The room was extremely quiet, one could even hear their weak and short breaths.

“Huala”

At this moment, a sound came from the medicinal pool!

Yan Ruoxue’s palm was lifted up gently.
