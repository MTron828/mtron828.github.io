2460 Unconcealable Murderous Intent

He found it difficult to suppress the murderous intent in his heart. If it wasn’t for the fact that he had so many helpers around him, he might have already attacked directly.

“If you were in the city, I might cause resentment if I were to attack you. But you’ve left the city yourself, and there’re many ways to die.” The corners of his mouth curled into a cold smile.

“Boom!”

Suddenly, a demonic flame soared into the sky.

The demonic flames engulfed Yan Ruoxue and turned into an enormous fist that crashed down directly.

A massive force was released, but Yan Ruoxue was expressionless.

With a slight movement of her hand, a lotus flower took shape in the center of her palm.

As she exhaled, the lotus flower and the enormous fist clashed.

“Explode!”

Yan Ruoxue’s lips moved slightly.

The lotus leaves scattered and then exploded.

In an instant, four spatial gates appeared around the fist, and a violent suction force pulled them respectively.

The fist flew in all directions, brushing past Yan Ruxue and landing on a tall mountain 10,000 meters behind her.

“Boom!”

With a massive tremor, the demonic flames instantly melted the peaks. After the rocks melted, they slowly flowed down.

After it cooled down, it became a glass that flickered with brilliant light.

“What an exquisite spatial control technique. Such a powerful soul…”

Nearly a thousand monster races were before them, and the leader was a gray-haired old man.

“This old man is also a monster race?”

Chang Mang looked at this frail old man and felt he had nothing to do with the monster race at all.

“Becoming a monster with a thought. What’s a monster? When the darkest power dominates a living being’s temperament, it’s possessed by the monster. Don’t underestimate this old man. He surely has his methods to become the leader.”

Lei Xin instantly appeared beside him.

“Kill them!”

The old man’s finger pointed out, and the 1,000 monster race charged over.

That mighty momentum was like a cavalry about to crash into the crowd.

Several of them went up to them, and these people only had the strength of True Saint Realm.

They were no match for Chang Mang, Yan Ruoxue, Lei Xinlei, and others.

However, when charging, they used their enormous bodies to attack.

Several times they could suppress Chang Mang and Jue Wu’s attacks with just a few dozen of them. By the time they finished dealing with the 1,000 army, Chang Mang and Jue Wu were already panting.

“These guys ‘bodies are unbelievably tough. Their bodies seemed to have been tempered by something.”

Chang Mang’s expression appeared to be somewhat solemn. His holy body was originally tremendously powerful.

Against these monster race armies, they had to fight for a long time before they could kill them.

Mysterious Dark Finger!

The old man pointed at them.

Before this finger, there was no power of the way in his hand at all.

“Don’t attack!”

Yan Ruoxue’s expression changed as if she had noticed something wrong.

“Sky-splitting Slash!”

Yan Ruxue raised her index and middle fingers slightly and placed them before her forehead.

Terrifying spatial qi gathered like the sea, forming a giant sword.

In the next moment, it slashed down straight away.

With this move, the clouds in the sky were even cut apart. The middle of the blue sky seemed to have an additional sword scar.

Under this attack, the power of Soul Sinking completely erupted.

A thin line appeared on the old man’s finger, and then a line of blood slowly appeared on his head.

A breath later, his body was split into two halves and smashed down from the sky.

“So powerful!”

He had seen Yan Tianlong use the Sky-splitting Slash before, but compared to Yan Ruoxue, it was like the difference between heaven and earth.

Yan Ruoxue had suppressed the spatial qi to be thinner than paper. The power struck directly into the thin lines, causing the erupted power to reach its utmost.

Yan Ruoxue looked somewhat unnatural as if she was also injured. She spoke with a solemn expression.

“Everyone, be careful. The Path of Heaven seems to have directly instilled power into the monster race’s bodies. The power of the Mysterious Dark Finger just now is tremendously powerful, and the power contains a tremendously cold internal qi. If I did not kill it with a slash just now, I might not be a match for a head-on clash.”

Yan Ruoxue’s expression was stern. She had already used her technique to the extreme.

She did not expect her to be injured. This old man of the monster race was not to be underestimated.

“The monster race has its special characteristics. Some are born to kill, and their souls are turbid, making it difficult for them to comprehend the Path of Heaven. If such people can enter the monster realm, with the help of the Path of Heaven, they will instead become very terrifying. The sacrifice of the monster realm’s Path of Heaven can completely avoid this shortcoming.” Lei Xin’s expression was tremendously solemn.

Perhaps it was because it had been suppressed by the human race for many years. Therefore, regardless of the ghost or the monster realm, the Path of Heaven had undergone tremendous changes.

The living beings in it were easier to cultivate and could obtain power through much simpler methods than the human race.

With this rise and fall, the future of the human race was even less optimistic.

“Could it be that the Path of Heaven wants to exterminate the human race?”

Yan Ruoxue smiled bitterly.

Although the Path of Heaven was divided into different races, they ultimately shared the same goal. There was only one possibility for such an unbalanced situation. And that was the power of the Path of Heaven was suppressing the human race.

“It’s still too early to talk about this now. Let’s see if we see for ourselves the Godly King of the monster race. We have to see how powerful they are. If we can’t even fight against the Godly King, I’m afraid that’s the true danger of the human race.”

Flower Granny waved her hand, indicating for them to set off quickly.

They had traveled through various continents and had come here personally.

Only then could they experience the tragic situation in the plane where the monster race had wreaked havoc.

It was almost a scene of devastation. The soil on the ground was mixed with the blood that had long solidified. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Body fragments could be seen everywhere. Many ordinary people were also on these planes. At this moment, after the monster race’s attack, they had long become ruins.

From the skeletons, even the women and children who had no combat strength could be seen buried.

“Go to hell!”

Chang Mang saw several hundred monster races and immediately charged forward with a furious roar.

“If you see monster races appearing, kill them if you can handle them!”

Qin Yu said coldly.

Those who were not of the same race must die.

Qin Yu and the others attacked in anger, and this monster race army was not a match at all.

On the way to the Fire Unicorn Continent, once Qin Yu and the others sensed the presence of the monster race, they killed them mercilessly.

In a few days, nearly hundreds of thousands of monster races had fallen at their hands.

Qin Yu absorbed every drop of the demonic qi and converted it into the tremendously pure monster elemental energy.

His chaotic qi and monster elemental energy would explode and burst out terrifying destructive energy. Now was the perfect time to collect this qi of monster race.

At this moment, in the monster realm of another dimension.

In the towering Wolf Smoke Great Hall, a colossal monster race that was several hundred feet tall sat on a gigantic chair.

Around him, many strange-looking things shuttling back and forth.
