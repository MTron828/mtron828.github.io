Chapter 999: Chapter 999, searching for the heavenly vanilla

Qin Yu’s hands pierced through young master Ning’s dantian, and his hands were immediately stained with blood.

Then, Qin Yu pulled out his golden core and crushed it with his bare hands!

Young Master Ning stared at Qin Yu.

He didn’t want to move. He would die in the hands of someone who couldn’t use spiritual power!

“Bang!”

Young Master Ning’s body fell to the ground.

Qin Yu’s face was expressionless.

The people around him were even more silent. No one had expected this result.

Qin Yu glanced around coldly, then turned around and left.

This time, no one dared to stop Qin Yu.

But Qin Yu knew very well that under the control of the martial arts association in Jingdu, Qin Yu had been completely molded into a villain.

It could be seen from the places where Qin Yu had passed through in the past few days.

Almost everyone wished they could kill Qin Yu.

“Looks like I can’t stay in the country any longer.”Qin Yu took a deep breath.

His reputation was already bad to begin with, and now that he had killed Young Master Ning in public, his future path would only become more and more troublesome.

After thinking about it, Qin Yu decided to leave the fire country for the time being.

Firstly, he wanted to avoid being hunted down by the martial saint. Secondly, it had been a long time since he had gone back to the Heaven Gate.

After all, it was his own sect. If he were to let it go like this, he would only slowly lose the hearts of the people.

Hence, on the same day, Qin Yu bought a plane ticket and took a plane to leave the fire country, heading straight for the Pyro Kingdom.

After spending a few hours, Qin Yu finally arrived at the Pyro Kingdom.

The Pyro Kingdom was an extremely chaotic place to begin with. Many sects had been set up here.

Even though Qin Yu had almost suppressed all the sects, large and small, Shengguo had already established a new sect after a long time.

Qin Yu took a taxi and rushed to the Heaven Gate.

The gate of the Heaven Gate was extremely grand and grand. Although Qin Yu was not there, he controlled everyone’s lives with the divine seal pill.

Therefore, the Heaven Gate was still developing in an orderly manner.

Standing at the gate, two people conveniently stopped Qin Yu.

“Who are you?”The two people asked coldly.

“My name is Qin Yu, the sect Master of Heaven Gate,”Qin Yu said quietly.

When the two people heard this, they looked at each other.

“Wait a moment,”one of them said.

Then, he quickly ran back.

After a few minutes, he walked out with a middle-aged man.

The middle-aged man walked quickly to Qin Yu, then cupped his hands and said, “Greetings, Sect Master Qin!”

Qin Yu looked him up and down and said, “You are?”

“I am the acting sect master recommended by my brothers. My name is NIE tianxiang,”said the middle-aged man.

Qin Yu nodded slightly and waved his hand. “Let’s go in first.”

He walked into the hall of the Heaven Gate with Nie tianxiang.

This hall was extremely grand, as if it was an ancient imperial palace.

Nie tianxiang cupped his hands and invited Qin Yu to the main seat, and then sat at the side.

“When I’m not here, there won’t be any trouble at the Heaven Gate, right?”Qin Yu asked.

NIE tianxiang didn’t dare to hide it, and immediately told Qin Yu about the development of the Heaven Gate during this period of time.

Through nie tianxiang’s narration, Qin Yu learned that the Heaven Gate now had more than twenty martial marquis and three half-step martial saints!

One of them was about to step into the martial saint realm!

This could not help but cause Qin Yu to be a little surprised.

His heaven gate actually had such powerful strength?

“If I step into the martial saint realm, the effect of the divine seal pill will disappear.”Qin Yu could not help but feel a little headache.

At that time, if Qin Yu wanted to sit firmly in this position, it would not be so simple.

“What is the name of the person who is about to become a martial saint?”Qin Yu asked.

NIE tianxiang quickly replied, “His name is Zhu Jinglong.”

“Zhu Jinglong... call him over,”Qin Yu said.

Nie tianxiang hurriedly nodded and said, “Yes.”

A few minutes later, a young man followed behind nie tianxiang and walked in.

When he saw Qin Yu in front of him, Zhu Jinglong cupped his hands and said, “Greetings, sect leader Qin.”

Qin Yu nodded.

He sized up Zhu Jinglong before him and frowned slightly.

This Zhu Jinglong did not look old.

He was about to step into the martial saint realm at such a young age. This kind of person was usually arrogant and would never lower himself to anyone.

“Now, I don’t have the heavenly vanilla and am unable to step into the martial saint realm. If he is one step faster than me, I will definitely lose the Heaven Gate,”Qin Yu thought to himself.

However, if he were to get rid of Zhu Jinglong for no reason, it was likely that the hearts of everyone would scatter.

Even the ancient emperors had to find a reason to kill people, let alone Qin Yu?

He sized up Zhu Jinglong in front of him. For a moment, he could not do anything to him.

“Looks like I have to think of a way to find the heavenly vanilla as soon as possible.”Qin Yu rubbed his forehead. He only felt waves of headache.

Then, Qin Yu looked at nie tianxiang and said, “Pass down my order. Let everyone find the heavenly vanilla at all costs!”

“Heavenly vanilla? What’s That?”Nie tianxiang asked.

Qin Yu waved his hand and said, “Those who have this will naturally know.” Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“Spread the news that the Heaven Gate is collecting the heavenly vanilla. As long as we can get the heavenly vanilla, I’m willing to exchange it with the nine transformation golden pill.”

Nie tianxiang quickly cupped his hands and said, “Yes!”

In the following time, the entire Heaven Gate was collecting the heaven vanilla.

In the blink of an eye, three days had passed, but there was no news of the Heaven Vanilla.

“It seems like getting the heaven vanilla is not that simple.”Qin Yu could not help but show a trace of worry on his face.

After all, the Heaven Vanilla came from a high-level mystic realm. It was more difficult than expected to get one.

A few days later, there was still no news of the Heaven Vanilla.

The people of the Heaven Gate had searched the entire Sheng kingdom and even spread the news overseas, but it was still useless.

Just when Qin Yu was about to give up, nie tianxiang suddenly ran in and said, “Sect Master Qin, someone wants to see you. He claims to have the Heaven Vanilla.”

Hearing this, Qin Yu’s eyes immediately lit up.

He quickly got up and said anxiously, “Quick, Go and invite him in!”

“Yes!”
