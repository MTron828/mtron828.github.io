2069 The Immortal Scripture Is in Hand!

The two were not loud but sounded thunderous to Qin Yu at this moment.

He couldn’t help but step back and murmur, “Qin… Qin Wuji… I… How can I…”

“Back then, Lord Wu Ji once said that he wanted to see through the reincarnation method and wait for the arrival of the Golden Age. This way, he would know how powerful a chaotic body that had stepped into the Immortal Emperor Realm would be,” the elderly man said slowly.

“You look so much alike to Lord Wu Ji back then,” the other elderly man said.

“But I’m not him,” Qin Yu frowned and said.

“Who knows if you’re?” The elderly man shook his head.

“No matter what, you are still the chaotic body of this generation. You may have inherited Lord Wu Ji’s ‘faith’,” the other elderly man said.

Qin Yu was silent. He knew what “Wu Ji” meant, and he also knew the glorious history of Wu Ji. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Since ancient times, almost everyone had been guessing how powerful the Immortal Emperor Realm was. However, no one knew about it.

At this moment, these two attendants seemed to have placed all their hopes on Qin Yu.

“Alright!” Finally, Qin Yu’s eye expression gradually turned determined.

“Although I’m not Lord Wu Ji, I’m willing to inherit his faith and work hard to fulfill his wish!” he said, looking at the two elderly men.

After hearing Qin Yu’s words, tears welled up in the eyes of the two elderly men again.

It was as if they had seen Lord Wu Ji in the past. Countless memories surged into their minds.

They were the most loyal followers of Wu Ji, and they were even willing to be the guardians after his death. Such faith was indescribable.

“May I ask the two seniors? Is Lord Wu Ji’s body in the coffin?” Qin Yu asked in a deep voice.

“Lord Wu Ji’s body isn’t here at all. Back then, he left the Holy Region long ago.” The elderly man shook his head.

“As expected. It seems that the rumors outside are true,” Qin Yu said in a deep voice.

“Was there no more traces of Lord Wu Ji since then?” Qin Yu raised his head and asked.

The two elderly men nodded at the same time, giving Qin Yu an affirmative answer.

“Before we died, we still believed that Lord Wu Ji was not dead. It is a pity that we didn’t get to see him for the last time, nor did we see him lecture dao…”

The tone of the two was full of regret and yearning. At this moment, Qin Yu seemed to have become their new hope.

At this moment, their bodies began to transform into dao, as if they would disappear at any moment.

They didn’t answer Qin Yu. Instead, they looked at Qin Yu with deep affection, and their eyes were full of admiration.

“We hope you will fulfill Lord Wu Ji’s wish…”

At this moment, their bodies completely transformed into dao and evolved into numerous images.

Scene after scene appeared in front of Qin Yu. The dao techniques that they conquered the world and were invincible when they were young flashed past at a tremendous speed.

Their invincible lives evolved in a short while. The indestructible faith and its unparalleled aura moved people.

A man with dark black hair appeared at the final moment of the dao transformation. This man had his back facing all living beings but had an imposing manner that could swallow mountains and rivers.

“Is that person Wu Ji?” Qin Yu murmured. He tried to stretch out his hand, but the dao technique completely disappeared instantly.

“Rumble…”

A strange phenomenon occurred, and the coffin slowly moved away.

Wisps of chaotic qi gushed out. Wu Ji’s corpse was not in the coffin but his clothes and two scriptures. Other than that, there was nothing else.

“The chaotic qi… actually came from this clothes…” Qin Yu murmured.

Although it was just ordinary clothes, the internal qi it emitted at this moment had surpassed that of a Saint Weapon and was close to a tribulation magical artifact!

“Traceless Immortal Scripture!”

Qin Yu took a closer look. The Traceless Immortal Scripture sought by the world was written on the two scriptures!

It was in his hands now. At last, it was really in his hands!

Qin Yu held Wu Ji’s relic with both hands and had mixed feelings.

However, all of these thoughts turned into excitement in the end!

“Traceless Immortal Scripture… It even surpasses an Immortal Emperor dao technique.” Qin Yu suppressed the excitement in his heart and carefully picked up the Traceless Immortal Scripture.

After that, Qin Yu kept away the Traceless Immortal Scripture. As for Wu Ji’s clothes, Qin Yu just put in on.

The clothes fit Qin Yu perfectly. It was as if it was tailor-made!

“Looks like what those two Seniors said is true…” Qin Yu murmured.

Could it be that there was indeed some relationship between him and Wu Ji?

“I can’t be bothered.” Qin Yu took a deep breath.

Since he had obtained the Daoist name of Wu Ji, he would carry on his faith and step into the Invincible Realm!

After putting everything away, Qin Yu turned around and left.

Perhaps because he had obtained Wu Ji’s inheritance, Qin Yu’s departure seemed tremendously relaxed this time.

Those mysterious creatures did not attack Qin Yu either. They did not even look at him.

“Hmm?”

At this moment, Qin Yu seemed to have thought of something.

He sized up the Chaos Grave and said in a low voice, “In the future, I can hide here for retreat if I have nowhere to go.”

Of course, it was just Qin Yu’s idea. After all, the nine great aristocratic families might bring their Immortal Emperor magical artifacts to attack the Chaos Grave directly.

At this moment, Jiang Wushuang was still standing at the same spot, waiting for Qin Yu. Seeing Qin Yu walk out safe and sound, he was instantly delighted.

“Brother Qin has come out? How was it? Have you obtained the hidden treasure?” Jiang Wushuang asked impatiently.

Qin Yu shook his head without thinking. “No. With my ability, I can’t get it.”

“What do you mean?” Jiang Wushuang frowned.

Qin Yu sighed and said, “There’s a coffin in there, but I failed to move it. Holy Son Jiang, I advise you to go back and let your True Saint come.”

Jiang Wushuang sized Qin Yu up suspiciously and said, “You really didn’t get anything?”

“Why would I lie to you?” Qin Yu said shamelessly. “If I’ve obtained the Traceless Immortal Scripture, I won’t have the time to talk nonsense with you here now.”

After saying that, Qin Yu walked out of the Chaos Grave.

Seeing this, Jiang Wushuang could only follow closely behind Qin Yu.

The two quickly walked out of the Chaos Grave. As for the nine sanctums, they were still majestic and undestroyed.

“Did you see that? Those nine sanctums are still standing majestically there. If I had obtained the hidden treasure, those nine training halls would have been extinguished long ago,” Qin Yu took the opportunity to say.

Jiang Wushuang seemed to think it made sense. Thus he said with a smile, “Brother Qin, how about you lend all your supreme bones to me?”
