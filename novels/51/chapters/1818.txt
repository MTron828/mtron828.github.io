1819 Traveling with Yan Ruoxue

Qin Yu lowered his head, not knowing what to say.

There was joy in his heart, but there was also a trace of inferiority mixed with this joy.

“This is not the place to talk. I’ll wait for you at Lake Crescent Moon in front,” Yan Ruoxue said.

“Alright,” Qin Yu nodded and said.

Following that, Yan Ruoxue kept away the light and rushed toward Lake Crescent Moon, stepping on the jade lotus.

Qin Yu walked all the way to the foot of the mountain. As soon as he reached the foot of the mountain, he was stopped by Tan Liu.

It was obvious that he had been waiting here for a long time. When he saw Qin Yu walking out, Tan Liu rushed toward him and grabbed his wrist.

His eyes were wide open, and terrifying anger erupted from his whole body.

“You b*stard! You dared to lie to me!” Tan Liu gritted his teeth, wishing he could swallow Qin Yu alive.

“I’m really sorry,” Qin Yu said awkwardly. “I was forced to do so. But don’t worry, I’ll make it up to you.”

“Make it up for me? Make up my a*s! Who do you think you are to make it up for me? You’re a liar! I won’t believe you anymore!” Tan Liu furiously said.

“How about this?” Qin Yu thought for a moment and said. “I’ll find a way to let you enter the Yan family. How about that?”

“F*ck you! Are you trying to cheat me for the second time?” Tan Liu cursed.

Seeing this, Qin Yu could only say shamelessly, ” Things have turned out this way. It’s useless even if you kill me. Moreover, you may not be my match. Why don’t you believe me once more? You won’t suffer any losses anyway.”

“F*ck you! What if you take the opportunity to run away?” Tan Liu said angrily.

“If I wanted to run, I wouldn’t have come out of here. Besides, I want to leave now. Do you think you can stop me?” Qin Yu said.

Tan Liu was furious, but he really could not do anything to Qin Yu.

They would probably anger the Si and Yan family if they started a fight here.

“Where should I wait for you?” The helpless Tan Liu could only compromise.

Qin Yu thought for a moment and said, “We’ll go to the inn we stayed in before. Before I go there, please don’t leave.”

Tan Liu gritted his teeth and said, “If you dare to lie to me again, I won’t let you off even if I have to risk my life!”

“Don’t worry. I won’t lie to you,” Qin Yu said seriously.

Tan Liu snorted coldly. He didn’t pursue the matter any further and turned around to leave.

Qin Yu didn’t waste time and immediately went straight to Lake Crescent Moon.

The scenery at Lake Crescent Moon was very beautiful.

As its name suggested, the shape of the entire lake was like a crescent moon.

In the middle of Lake Crescent Moon, Yan Ruoxue was waiting for Qin Yu on a small boat.

After seeing Qin Yu’s figure, Yan Ruoxue waved at him.

Qin Yu stomped his foot, stepped on the lake, and ran toward the boat.

Qin Yu had an indescribable feeling the moment he landed on the boat.

The feeling of being so close and yet so far from her made Qin Yu feel a little lost.

“What’s the matter? Are you backing out?” Yan Ruoxue asked with a smile.

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “No, I’m just… I’m not confident.”

“No confidence?” Yan Ruoxue was a little surprised.

“You don’t have confidence in me, or you?”

Qin Yu opened his mouth and said after a moment, “Both. Si Shiyue’s strength is indeed more powerful than I imagined. And… he is indeed very outstanding.”

When Yan Ruoxue heard this, she could not help but sigh.

She held Qin Yu’s hand and said, “There are many outstanding people in this world. However, there is only one Qin Yu and one Yan Ruoxue.

“I’ve always believed in you. As long as you want it, you’ll definitely be able to do it. If you’re afraid, then I’ll be very disappointed.”

Yan Ruoxue looked at Qin Yu seriously. Her big eyes were full of sincerity and anticipation.

After hearing Yan Ruoxue’s words, Qin Yu’s confidence was reignited.

He took a deep breath and said, “I will definitely surpass Si Shiyue. This day won’t take too long.”

“I also believe in you.” Yan Ruoxue gently leaned against Qin Yu’s chest and wrapped her arms around Qin Yu’s waist.

Qin Yu was stunned. He tried to raise his hand and hold Yan Ruoxue in his arms.

The two of them hugged each other in such a manner, and neither of them spoke.

The entire world seemed to have come to a standstill at this moment. How they wished this moment would last forever!

“It’s said that a blessing has been given to Lake Crescent Moon. As long as two people kiss on the lake, they will be together forever.”

At this moment, Yan Ruoxue suddenly raised her head and looked at Qin Yu.

Qin Yu was about to speak when Yan Ruoxue’s moist red lips moved forward to kiss him.

Qin Yu was stunned. When he came back to his senses, he hugged Yan Ruoxue tightly and kissed her.

The two of them hugged and kissed on Lake Crescent Moon. Their fiery feelings seemed to have exploded at this moment.

“If you’re worried, I can give you everything I have,” Yan Ruoxue’s voice rang out in Qin Yu’s mind.

“Now, right here.” Yan Ruoxue’s voice almost made Qin Yu lose his mind.

He hugged Yan Ruoxue tightly and his hand could not help but caress her clothes.

However, at this moment, Qin Yu suddenly came back to his senses.

“No,” he shook his head hurriedly and said coldly. “I want to have you fair and square. I don’t need such a promise.”

Yan Ruoxue’s beautiful eyes flickered. Looking at the person she loved in front of her, her entire person seemed to be melting.

“You should go back earlier. I don’t know when the day of the Path of Heaven will come, but I will definitely surpass Si Shiyue before that,” Qin Yu said.

“It wasn’t easy for me to come out. Why should I go back now?” Yan Ruoxue smiled and said.

“I’m afraid I’ll cause you trouble,” Qin Yu said with a frown.

“I’m not in any trouble,” Yan Ruoxue smiled and said.

“However, if others find out about this, it will bring you trouble. Are you afraid?” Yan Ruoxue blinked and asked.

“I’m not afraid!” Qin Yu said with determination.

“Silly you!” Yan Ruoxue couldn’t help but laugh. She waved her hand and covered Qin Yu’s face.

At the same time, Yan Ruoxue also covered her face.

“At any time, staying alive is the most important thing,” Yan Ruoxue smiled and said.

At this moment, Yan Ruoxue pulled Qin Yu and said, “Let’s go.”

“Where are we going?” Qin Yu was stunned.

“To have fun, of course,” Yan Ruoxue smiled and said.

Then, she pulled Qin Yu and left Lake Crescent Moon.

Qin Yu didn’t know where Yan Ruoxue was taking him. So he could only follow her closely.

Even though Yan Ruoxue’s face was covered, Qin Yu was still a little worried. He was worried that someone would find out about this and cause trouble for Yan Ruoxue.

The two of them shuttled through the crowd. She took Qin Yu to a city near Mount Taihua to eat the delicacies of Zhongzhou and go to all the entertainment in Zhongzhou. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

There was a street called Deity Street. It had a dazzling array of magical artifacts, herbs, and divine weapons.

As long as Qin Yu glanced at it, Yan Ruoxue would buy it for him without hesitation.
