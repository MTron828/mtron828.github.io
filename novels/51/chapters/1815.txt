1816 Stepping into the Grand Event

After taking the invitation letter, Qin Yu turned around and left. He was afraid that Tan Liu would regret his decision.

After running a long distance to ensure Tan Liu could no longer see him, Qin Yu took off his black robe and returned to the inn, stepping the line word formula.

As soon as Qin Yu returned, Tan Liu came back after him.

“Brother Tie, an idiot spent 200 million to buy the invitation!” Tan Liu said excitedly.

Qin Yu’s face turned gloomy, but he still smiled and said, “Maybe that invitation is very important to him.”

“Let’s not bother about that. We’ll each take half of the money!” Tan Liu took out his card and was about to split the amount equally with Qin Yu.

With Tan Liu’s behavior, Qin Yu felt even more guilty.

“No need. I’m not short of money. You can keep it for yourself,” Qin Yu waved her hand and said.

“How can I do that? I must split the money with you!” Tan Liu said stubbornly.

However, Qin Yu insisted on not accepting it. Thus Tan Liu had no choice but to keep it while he kept sighing that Qin Yu was a good person.

The following day, Qin Yu invited Tan Liu to a meal. He had wanted to disappear, but after thinking about it, he decided not to. After all, even if he did leave, they would definitely meet at Mount Taihua.

In the blink of an eye, it was the day of the grand event.

On this day.

Huge carriages appeared in the sky one after another.

People in luxurious clothes with powerful internal qi were sitting in the carriages. Their expressions were cold and extremely dignified.

In front of the carriages, huge rare beasts were running wildly. These rare beasts actually had the strength of the Reversion Void Stage and were extremely terrifying!

“Even the beasts pulling the carriages are at the Reversion Void Stage.” Qin Yu couldn’t help but sigh in his heart.

Was this the strength of the nine great aristocratic families? It was indeed shocking.

Qin Yu was looking at the carriages that sped past one after another, trying to find Yan Ruoxue.

Unfortunately, Qin Yu could not find her.

Such a wondrous scene attracted the attention of countless people.

They gasped in admiration, full of emotions seeing this wondorous scene.

“Brother Tie, let’s go,” Tan Liu said.

“Mmm,” Qin Yu responded “Let’s go.”

The two walked toward Mount Taihua.

At this moment, the top of Mount Taihua was emitting an extremely holy light. It was like a fairyland.

It was obvious that they had set up a terrifying formation above to prevent anyone from coming to cause trouble.

Qin Yu and Tan Liu hurried to the top of Mount Taihua on foot. Along the way, Qin Yu was feeling extremely uneasy in his heart. But he was more nervous and excited, mixed with a trace of anger…

He was excited that he was finally going to see Yan Ruoxue. The anger naturally was because of Si Shiyue.

“We’re finally going to meet.” At the thought of Si Shiyue, Qin Yu’s face turned terribly cold.

Along the way, there were also people like Qin Yu who went to Mount Taihua on foot. However, most of them took the carriage and landed on the mountaintop.

After a long time, Qin Yu and Tan Liu finally arrived at the mountaintop.

The mountaintop was huge and flat. Rumor had it that the Yan family had flattened the peak with a single strike, turning the uneven mountain into what it was now.

Many people had gathered on the mountaintop. There were immortal tables made of jade and man-made immortal springs.

There was a divine tree in the middle of the mountaintop. The divine tree had an extraordinary origin and not inferior to Qin Yu’s Enlightenment Technique.

Two people were guarding the entrance. They had extremely powerful strength that Qin Yu could not see through at all.

“That’s the place,” Tan Liu pointed at the two men and said.

Qin Yu could not help but look at Tan Liu guiltily. He said softly in his heart, “I can only say sorry.”

Soon, the two arrived at the entrance.

The two cultivators in charge of guarding the place immediately blocked their way.

“Who’re you?” one of them said.

“This is Shi Yuetie, an old friend of Young Master Si Shiyue,” Tan Liu said excitedly.

“What Shi Yuetie? I’ve never heard of it!” the two of them berated.

Tan Liu frowned. He looked at Qin Yu and said, “Does the status of these two people too low to recognize you?”

Qin Yu didn’t dare to answer him. He quickly took out the invitation and handed it to him.

Upon seeing the invitation letter, Tan Liu was instantly stunned.

“Brother Tie, you… What do you mean by this?” Tan Liu’s brows were tightly knitted.

Qin Yu said rather awkwardly, “I’m really sorry. I lied to you. I don’t know Si Shiyue at all. I was also the one who bought your invitation letter a few days ago. I’m really sorry. I’ll definitely make it up to you in the future.” Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

After saying this, Qin Yu quickly walked in.

Tan Liu was stunned. He was extremely angry and instantly wanted to rush in.

Unfortunately, Tan Liu couldn’t even take half a step in front of these two guardians.

“Shi Yuetie, you are a f*cking b*stard. I will never let you go!”

Tan Liu’s angry scolding was behind him, but Qin Yu could only brace himself and pretend he did not hear it.

After stepping into the grand event, Qin Yu realized that those who came here were either from the Yan family, the Si family, or the sects that were affiliated with them.

In short, the people who could come here were all extremely powerful.

Even the cultivators who served the people had stepped into the Reversion Void Stage.

“It’s truly terrifying,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

Fortunately, no one here paid attention to Qin Yu. He was like an invisible person, so there was no need to worry too much.

He then came to a jade table and sat down. He picked up the immortal fruit on the table and began to chew.

The wealth of these aristocratic families was indeed terrifying. Even the immortal fruits on the table were more superior than Spirit Pills and miraculous elixirs. The moment he swallowed them, rich spiritual energy flowed through his body, and his spirit was instantly lifted.

“Since I’m already here, it’d be a waste not eating them,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

He was like a different species in this grand event, eating and drinking like a monkey jumping up and down.

Qin Yu didn’t look around carefully until he was full.

A few supreme treasures were hanging around on the top of the mountain. At a closer look, each of them was a top-tier Saint Weapon.

And the formation around them was even more terrifying. No one knew what kind of top-tier supreme treasures were used as the eyes of the formation. Wisps of internal qi that surpassed the Holy Power were permeating the air.

Many young men gathered together and seemed to be talking about something.

Qin Yu thought for a while and finally decided to join them.

“Brother Sui, your cultivation realm seems to have advanced.”

“That’s right. I was lucky enough to reach the middle stage of Reversion Void.”

“Congratulations, Brother Sui. Brother Sui’s talent really makes us envious.”

Everyone toasted and praised each other.

“Among the younger generation, who do you think will be the first to enter the True Saint realm?” someone suddenly sighed with emotion and asked.

“True Saint realm? In any case, I’m afraid I’ll need 500 years.”

“I’m afraid I’ll need 1,000 years.”

“I don’t know if there’s any hope for Si Shiyue. He has a first-generation bloodline inheritance and a chaotic body. Once he steps into the True Saint cultivation realm, he’ll be invincible.”
