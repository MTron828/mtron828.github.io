Hearing this, the six of them nodded at the same time.

They looked at Qin Yu with a grave expression and walked over one after another.

Third Brother, who had almost collapsed from Qin Yu’s punch earlier, also walked over.

Facing the six Martial Marquises, Qin Yu didn’t show the slightest bit of fear. On the contrary, his blood was boiling, and his fighting spirit was overflowing!

“Boom!”

Just as the six of them were deep in thought, Qin Yu took the initiative to attack, and clenched his fist!

Qin Yu raised his hand and used the Absolute Beginning Sacred Fist. The terrifying golden light and qi energy made the six of them turn pale with fright!

These six Martial Marquises didn’t dare to be negligent, and all of them unleashed their own spells in an attempt to stop Qin Yu! FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

However, at this moment, Qin Yu was at the peak of his fighting spirit. The force of his fist was invincible, and the internal qi contained within it was beyond imagination!

All the spells were shattered at this moment. The terrifying golden light pierced through the six people and forced the six of them to retreat several steps!

“What powerful battle strength!” Someone exclaimed.

“This guy isn’t an ordinary Martial Marquis. Everyone must immediately join hands and suppress him!”

Xia Hang, who was at the side, shouted even louder, “If we are defeated at our headquarters, the status of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association will be threatened!”

“Of course we know that,” they said coldly.

Then, the eldest of the six shouted first, and a terrifying inner strength condensed on his fist!

In an instant, there was actually a dragon’s roar from his fist, and a ray of light turned into a divine dragon illuminating the entire Jingdu Martial Arts Association!

“Die!”

The eldest shouted, and his body suddenly disappeared. In the next second, he arrived in the sky above Qin Yu!

“You’re courting death!” Qin Yu’s expression turned cold. His fierce fist met the incoming attack!

Qin Yu had already gone crazy. He completely gave up on defense and used all his strength to meet the incoming attack!

Relying on his invincible body, Qin Yu’s moves were ferocious and unrestrained. All the golden light gathered on his fist!

Just one punch was enough to make everyone feel an intense sense of danger!

“Boom!”

The moment the two fists collided, the condensed divine dragon instantly collapsed!

Accompanied by a series of bone cracking sounds, the eldest was sent flying!

The terrifying fist force didn’t stop there. Instead, it rushed over!

“Oh no!” The eldest’s expression changed greatly. He disregarded the pain in his body and wanted to run away!

When the others saw that the situation wasn’t good, they activated their spells at the same time to stop Qin Yu!

However, Qin Yu was anxious to save Ruoxue and didn’t have the mood to tangle with them. Therefore, Qin Yu activated his Saintly Body Technique and ignored the spells of the few of them. He allowed the terrifying qi energy to smash onto his body!

Several spells actually failed to stop Qin Yu at all!

He clenched his golden fist and pushed forward!

The eldest’s pupils dilated, and his expression suddenly changed drastically!

“No... Don’t!” The eldest couldn’t help but shout out in fear.

But how could Qin Yu give him a chance?! This terrifying fist force was aimed at the eldest’ face!

“Boom!”

With one punch, the eldest’s head was smashed!

A Martial Marquis died just like that!

No one would have thought that the Martial Marquis of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association would actually be so vulnerable in front of Qin Yu!

Everyone felt waves of shock, and their hearts were palpitating with fear!

“Oh no! Retreat quickly!” They realized how terrifying Qin Yu was. They looked at each other and turned to leave!

“If you want to leave now, it’s too late!” Qin Yu shouted. With a shake of his feet, the Heavy Falling Space immediately spread out!

Everyone’s movements were immediately restricted, and their speed decreased by countless times!

The golden light on Qin Yu’s body grew even more intense, and this light practically illuminated the entire Jingdu Martial Arts Association!

“What kind of light is this?”

“It seems like someone forcefully broke into the Jingdu Martial Arts Association!”

For a moment, even people in the prison felt this power!

“Boom!”

The golden light instantly illuminated the surroundings so much that people couldn’t open their eyes!

“Bang!”

Those who couldn’t dodge in time were smacked to the ground, and many cracks appeared on their bodies!

“Everyone, try to escape quickly!” Xia Hang shouted!

“Of course we know. Xia Hang, cut the crap!” Everyone was flustered and exasperated as they cursed!

Who would have thought that Qin Yu’s combat strength would be so astonishing?!

Even more so, no one would have thought that Qin Yu wasn’t afraid of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association at all!

“Buzz!”

At this moment, someone took out a magical artifact.

The magical artifact carried a trace of peaceful power and spread out in the surroundings.

With the appearance of this magical artifact, Qin Yu’s Heavy Falling Space was crushed!

The few of them got a breath of air and started to run!

“You can actually break my Heavy Falling Space? As expected of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association!” Qin Yu pursued relentlessly from behind!

He immediately used Shrinking Ground Into An Inch and chased after them!

Looking at the six escaping people, Qin Yu’s pupils dilated, and he rushed towards Xia Hang!

Qin Yu’s goal wasn’t to kill people, but to save Ruoxue!

Qin Yu only knew that Xia Hang was the vice president among these people, so he definitely knew about Yan Ruoxue’s situation!

Seeing that Qin Yu was getting closer and closer, Xia Hang instantly became anxious.

He was on the verge of breaking down as he cursed, “Why the f * ck are you chasing me? There are so many people, so why the f * ck are you chasing me?!”

However, this didn’t stop Qin Yu. Very quickly, Qin Yu arrived in front of Xia Hang.

He raised both his hands and grabbed Xia Hang’s neck before lifting him into the air!

“Speak, where is Ruoxue?!” Qin Yu shouted angrily.

After Xia Hang’s throat was grabbed by Qin Yu, he looked like he was in extreme pain.

“Let go of me first...” Xia Hang said in pain.

Qin Yu glanced at Xia Hang coldly, then released his hand, and Xia Hang landed on the ground.

“Crack!”

Just as Xia Hang was about to let out a sigh of relief, a sharp pain came from his calf!

Qin Yu flicked his finger and shattered Xia Hang’s knee!

“Ah!!” The painful wail immediately spread throughout the Jingdu Martial Arts Association!

Cold sweat was dripping down his forehead, and his eyes were filled with hatred!

“Speak, where is Ruoxue?” Qin Yu looked at Xia Hang coldly.

Xia Hang gritted his teeth and looked at Qin Yu while saying, “You want to see Yan Ruoxue, right? Fine, I’ll bring you there. If you have the guts, come with me!”

“Cut the crap!” Qin Yu slapped Xia Hang’s face.

Xia Hang had never suffered such humiliation before. The veins on his forehead bulged, but he didn’t dare to say anything.

“Qin Yu, let me tell you, it’s not so easy to break into the Jingdu Martial Arts Association. You will regret it.” Xia Hang climbed up from the ground with difficulty.

He brought Qin Yu and walked deeper into the prison step by step.

A trace of coldness flashed across Xia Hang’s eyes. He couldn’t help but sneer as he thought, “The prison is filled with magical artifacts. If you dare to enter, you will die without a doubt!”

Qin Yu wasn’t stupid. Of course, he knew that the Jingdu Martial Arts Association wasn’t that simple.

But as long as he thought of Yan Ruoxue, who was suffering in the prison, Qin Yu’s heart felt like it was being cut by a knife. He couldn’t care less about any danger.
