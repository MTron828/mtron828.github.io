2063 The Si Family’s Immortal Scripture

Hearing Jiang He’s words, a hint of panic flashed across their faces.

They hurriedly took out the Mysterious Heavenly Mirror. As Jiang He had said, the Mysterious Heavenly Mirror in their hands was fake!

“Jiang He, you!” The elderly man was instantly enraged. Pointing at Jiang He, traces of killing intent burst out from his body!

Jiang He looked at him and said calmly, “Was it your idea or Holy Lord’s to take away the supreme bone and snatch back the tribulation magical artifact?”

The elderly man opened his mouth, not knowing how to answer.

The young cultivator beside him immediately said, “Of course, it was our idea! How could we give away the tribulation magical artifact so easily? We can give him Divine Medicine, but we can’t give him the tribulation magical artifact!”

After hearing this, Jiang He subconsciously glanced at Qin Yu as if expressing to Qin Yu that the Jiang family was different from the other aristocratic families.

However, all explanations were futile at this moment. These two people would never admit it, even if it were the Holy Lord’s idea.

“Qin Yu, you may leave,” Jiang He said.

Qin Yu slowly stood up. He looked coldly at the two cultivators and his body emitted traces of killing intent.

The elderly and young cultivators were a little nervous. Qin Yu, who had a tribulation magical artifact in his hand, was not someone they could deal with at all!

“What are you doing?” the young cultivator shouted.

Qin Yu ignored him and looked at Jiang He. “They know my identity now. I have to kill them. Otherwise, once this matter spreads, I will definitely die.”

Jiang He frowned even more.

He was the one who brought them out. If Qin Yu killed them, not only Jiang He could not explain himself, but Qin Yu would also offend the Jiang family. By then, it would be even more difficult for him to move around.

The elderly and young cultivators became even more panicked and subconsciously stepped back.

“Forget it.” But at this moment, Qin Yu deflated like a balloon.

He waved his hand and said, “You can take the supreme bone. But I only hope this matter will not spread. If I am still alive after this, I will return this tribulation magical artifact.”

The two cultivators were stunned, and their expressions became tremendously complicated. They stood there, not knowing what to say.

“Qin Yu, you…” The young cultivator seemed quite moved, and there was even a trace of guilt on his face.

“I just don’t want to cause trouble for Jiang He.” Qin Yu took a deep breath.

Qin Yu could enter the Chaos Grave as long as he had a tribulation magical artifact.

Only Qin Yu and the Jiang family could enter the Chaos Grave now.

As for the Si family, Qin Yu felt that they would most probably be deceived.

While Qin Yu and the Jiang family were exchanging the supreme bone and magical artifact, Xuan Jizi arrived at the Si family.

Under the guidance of the Si family’s Holy Lord, he arrived at the Mystic Realm in the depths of the Si family.

The secrets of the Si family were hidden here, including the Si family’s immortal scriptures.

“Where’s the supreme bone?” Holy Lord Si asked. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“I’m not a fool,” Xuan Jizi said with a faint smile. “If I give you the supreme bone now, what do I do if you fall out with me?”

“You’re not fooling us, are you, Xuan Jizi?” Holy Lord said coldly.

“What are you afraid of?” Xuan Jizi laughed heartily and said. “I’m in the Si family’s territory now.”

Although Holy Lord was furious, he had to get the supreme bone. Thus he could only bear with it.

“The Si family can only lend you the first volume of the immortal scripture. Don’t worry. This volume will help you prolong your life,” Holy Lord Si said coldly.

Xuan Jizi opened his mouth and was about to bargain when Holy Holy Lord Si said, “Forget it if you disagree, and you can leave now. I don’t believe only you have the supreme bone!”

Hearing Holy Lord Si’s unyielding tone, Xuan Jizi nodded and said, “Alright, I agree with you.”

“How much time do you need?” Holy Lord Si asked.

Xuan Jizi shook his head and said, “It’s an immortal scripture after all. It was left behind by the ancestors of the Si family. How long you can comprehend it depends on your comprehension ability. How do I guarantee that?”

“I will only give you three days,” Holy Lord Si said coldly.

“Our Si family can’t afford to wait. I guarantee you can’t leave the Si family if someone gets to the Chaos Grave before us!”

“Alright, I’ll agree to three days,” Xuan Jizi said in a deep voice. “It all depends on fate.”

Thus Holy Lord Si waved his hand and opened the Mystic Realm.

Only the first volume of the immortal scripture was placed in the Mystic Realm. The Immortal Emperor would naturally have a secret technique for life-prolonging and it was usually found in the first volume.

Other than the first volume, Xuan Jizi could not see anything else.

The Mystic Realm slowly closed, and the Si family used a major method to surround the entire secret realm.

“Keep an eye on him. Don’t let anyone get close to him, and don’t let him leave,” Holy Lord said coldly.

“Holy Lord, don’t worry,” a hoary voice sounded.

Holy Lord Si didn’t say anything else and left.

Si Shiyue saw all of this clearly.

His expression was incredibly cold, and a trace of anger burst out from the bottom of his heart.

As the Holy Son of the Si family, the Si family was an inviolable sacred existence in his heart!

Si Shiyue was furious at Xuan Jiziji’s attitude.

“Brother Yue, when you obtain the Traceless Immortal Scripture, you will definitely step into the True Sage cultivation realm right away. By that time, you can definitely kill him!” Si Shifeng, who was beside him, came up and said.

Si Shiyue took a deep breath and said in a low voice, “I hope everything goes smoothly.”

…

At the same time, Qin Yu was rushing toward the Chaos Grave.

He had everything he needed. He had to enter the Chaos Grave before everyone else!

Soon, Qin Yu arrived near the Chaos Grave.

Ever since the conditions to enter the Chaos Grave were made public, the number of cultivators who came to the Chaos Grave had decreased significantly.

Currently, those who could stand near the Chaos Grave mostly had tremendously powerful strength or foundation. They might even come from the outer region.

When Qin Yu arrived, a few unfamiliar cultivators were standing there.

They also had tribulation magical artifacts and path inscriptions, but they were lack of chaotic blood and the supreme bone.

“We’ve been guarding for three days, but we still haven’t obtained the chaotic blood and the supreme bone,” one of the cultivators said coldly.

There were many corpses under his feet. These corpses seemed to be the people who were about to enter the Chaos Grave. However, before they could enter, they were killed by these cultivators.

Qin Yu was shocked and hid immediately.

These cultivators were tremendously powerful. If Qin Yu showed any signs of entering the Chaos Grave, they would definitely attack him!

“It’s so difficult to step into the Chaos Grave.” Qin Yu took a deep breath and became even more anxious.

In that case, he could only wait for these people to leave.
