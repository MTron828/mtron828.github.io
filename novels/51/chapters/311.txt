Chapter 312: Targeted Again Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

With the eruption of internal qi, their strength of an Inner Strength Grandmaster was revealed!

The expressions of the two young men changed slightly, and they said coldly, “So there’s an Inner Strength Grandmaster overseeing things. No wonder he’s so arrogant!”

Even though that was the case, the two of them took large strides forward and charged towards Jiang Gu!

Jiang Gu, who possessed a holy body, had powerful strength!

Jiang Gu waved his large hand, and slapped his huge palm onto their faces!

With just the strength of his physical body, Jiang Gu sent the two of them flying!

“Get lost quickly!” Qin Yu said coldly.

The two of them covered their faces and crawled up. They pointed at Qin Yu and said, “My master will never let you off!”

“You two talk too much nonsense.” Qin Yu’s expression gradually turned cold. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

At this moment, an old man slowly walked out from the dark.

He put his hands behind his back and said with a nonchalant smile, “Sir, you are quite impressive. You have disturbed my peace, and you have also injured my disciple. Isn’t that a bit too far?”

“Master!” The two young men hurriedly ran to the side of the old man.

The old man waved his hand, and he walked out slowly.

Qin Yu looked at him coldly and said, “Are you Lord Xuan Yin?”

“Hahaha! Not bad.” Xuan Yin nodded slightly.

He sized up Qin Yu and said, “Young man, are you interested in the things here?”

“Who wouldn’t be interested in treasure?” Qin Yu said with a nonchalant smile.

Xuan Yin laughed out loud and said, “You’re right. I, Xuan Yin, don’t want to make enemies in the outside world, but I discovered this thing first. Don’t you agree with first come first serve?”

“First come first serve?” Qin Yu couldn’t help but laugh coldly.

“Your disciple said that as long as we are strong enough, we don’t have to be reasonable,” Qin Yu said coldly.

Xuan Yin raised his eyebrows. “With just this Inner Strength Grandmaster by your side?”

“So what?” Qin Yu said coldly.

Xuan Yin frowned slightly. After thinking for a while, he laughed out loud again. “I, Xuan Yin, don’t want to make enemies. Since you are so interested in this thing, why don’t I share it with you?”

This surprised Qin Yu a little. He didn’t expect Xuan Yin to be so easygoing!

“Please, sir,” said Xuan Yin.

“Mr. Qin, be careful of him,” reminded Jiang Gu.

Qin Yu nodded and said in a low voice, “Take good care of Xiao Yu.”

After saying that, Qin Yu took the lead and followed Xuan Yin in.

The deeper they went, the stronger the dark energy became.

By the time they reached the ghostly face, the dark energy had reached a terrifying level!

“Young man, the items are all here. You can choose yourself.” Xuan Yin waved his hand, and a few treasures appeared in front of him.

There was a sword, a long saber, and armor.

Although these weapons weren’t trash, they were definitely not considered treasures.

Qin Yu frowned slightly. He sized up Xuan Yin and couldn’t help but sneer inwardly.

The real treasure was probably hidden underground.

Xuan Yin merely threw out a few worthless items to send Qin Yu away as soon as possible.

“Is that all?” Qin Yu asked with feigned nonchalance.

Xuan Yin nodded and said, “That’s all. If you want it, you can take it all.”

Qin Yu sneered. “There’s more than that. If you really want to split it equally with me, you should take out the real treasures.”

“Real treasures? I don’t understand. What real treasures? It’s already in front of you.” Xuan Yin shook his head.

Qin Yu stepped on the ground and said, “It should be hidden here, right?”

When he heard this, Xuan Yin frowned for a while, and his expression gradually darkened.

“Huh? I found that I can do breathing exercises here!” At this moment, Xiao Yu suddenly exclaimed.

“Breathing exercises?” Before Qin Yu could say anything, Xuan Yin looked at Xiao Yu coldly.

“She’s actually a pure dark energy body?” A flash of shock appeared on Xuan Yin’s face, and then it was followed by a greedy look!

Xiao Yu naturally felt Xuan Yin’s greedy gaze. She waved her fist and said, “What... What are you doing? Let me tell you, I’m not someone to be trifled with!”

Qin Yu’s expression gradually turned cold.

At this moment, Xuan Yin waved his hand, and the weapons on the ground disappeared!

“I’ve changed my mind,” said Xuan Yin grimly.

Jiang Gu strode forward and berated, “What do you mean?!”

Xuan Yin sneered. “I wanted to give you two treasures to get rid of you guys, but now... I’m going to kill all of you! Then I’ll take away the pure dark energy body!”

“You’re courting death!” Jiang Gu flew into a rage and arrived in front of Xuan Yin in one step!

“You’d better think it over carefully,” Xuan Yin warned coldly.

“The dark energy is rampant here, and your inner strength will be suppressed! Do you think you’re my match?” Xuan Yin said with a nonchalant smile.

Jiang Gu’s expression changed slightly, then he frowned.

Qin Yu sneered. “Is that why you tricked us here?”

“That’s right.” Xuan Yin didn’t hide anything.

He put his hands behind his back and said indifferently, “If you had taken these things and got out of here, I would have spared your lives.”

“But if you hadn’t obeyed... I would have used the dark energy here to kill you guys!”

“I didn’t expect you to have a pure dark energy body by your side. The heavens are helping me!”

“You’re courting death!” Jiang Gu flew into a rage and threw a punch at Xuan Yin!

Jiang Gu, who had lost his inner strength, was no threat to Xuan Yin at all.

Therefore, Xuan Yin only raised his hand indifferently!

“Bang!”

However, when his fist touched Jiang Gu’s palm, Xuan Yin’s expression changed drastically!

This horrifying force broke the bones of Xuan Yin’s hand!

“What a strong body!” Xuan Yin’s expression changed!

Before he could recover from his shock, Jiang Gu threw another punch at him!

This time, Xuan Yin didn’t dare to take it head-on, and he retreated in a hurry!

Then, Xuan Yin waved his hand, and the dark energy in their surroundings immediately surged toward him!

In a moment, two black iron chains condensed in Xuan Yin’s hand!

The chains were approaching Jiang Gu with a cold gleam!

“Crash!”

In an instant, Jiang Gu’s body was tied up by the chains!

Jiang Gu struggled desperately, but he found that he couldn’t break free at all!

“Don’t waste your energy,” said Xuan Yin with a nonchalant smile.

“The chains are formed by the dark energy. The more you struggle, the tighter the chains are.”

Jiang Gu roared angrily, “Let me go now!”

However, Xuan Yin ignored Jiang Gu. He glanced at Qin Yu and said with a nonchalant smile, “Your bodyguard can’t help you anymore. Are you going to give her to me obediently, or do you want me to kill you?”
