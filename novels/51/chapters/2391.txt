2392 Test

Then why did he not even leave a suitable cultivation method for Qin Yu?

Just like his sect’s people would basically cultivate Immortal Emperor Lei’s immortal scripture, everyone in the Yan family would cultivate the Yan family’s immortal scripture and comprehend the power of spatial rules.

By slowly tempering the attributes of the soul, the peak of fourth grade could comprehend the sea of rules more easily.

“I’ll give you half a month. You have to get close to that tombstone where the will of Immortal Emperor Lei is, which might be helpful to you. Flower Granny and I received the guidance of Immortal Emperor Lei. If you can’t grasp the remaining, Yan Tianshi will benefit from it. Don’t make me look down on you. You go ahead!”

After saying that, the voice disappeared.

Qin Yu had a slight headache. This place was like a land of nothingness and chaos.

He could not control his body at all. He tried many times, but his body floated further and further away from the tombstone.

Could it be a method similar to entering the Sea of Soul?

Qin Yu thought to himself and decided to give up controlling his body altogether.

He then spread out his divine sense, and his desolate divine eye began to focus on the land of chaos in front of him.

Although this place was full of the terrifying power of thunder, it was indeed like what Dean Lei had said, that it was not as easy as grasping the spatial rules. Even after activating the desolate divine eye, his divine sense could not grasp the rules of thunder for a long time.

Outside the immortal grave, Lei Xin and Flower Granny stood together.

“Isn’t half a month too short? Back then, I seemed to have taken three whole months before entering the tombstone.”

Lei Xin said with a bitter smile.

“There isn’t much time left…”

Flower Granny shook her head. For the first time, her calm face showed a hint of impatience. Even when Yan Tianshi and Si Liuhe visited her, she had never shown such an expression.

Qin Yu only gradually grasped a trace of the power of thunder on the fifth day.

At that moment, he felt that even a trace of the power of thunder could make his body numb and painful for a long time.

When the numbness in her body disappeared, Qin Yu once again grabbed the chain of thunder and slowly moved forward.

The power of the thunder grew even stronger now. Qin Yu felt a sudden surge of electricity coursing through his entire body.

Every single cell in his body was in tremendous pain.

The power of thunder was indeed the most ferocious in the universe. Qin Yu’s body twitched uncontrollably.

As he advanced, the power of thunder Qin Yu suffered became even more intense.

With each step, the immense force struck against his body.

Dazzling lightning that people could not look straight at moved around his body. His soul instantly curled into a ball the moment the lightning struck him.

When the lightning struck his body, Qin Yu felt it seemed to be tempering his body as well. It was the power of the Immortal Emperor. Moreover, it grew from the gentle breeze to a storm of great magnitude to allow his body to adapt to it.

Qin Yu continued to move forward, but shock filled the eyes of Lei Xin and Flower Nanny.

“When I reached this point, an immortal lightning earlier had already caused my soul to be in intense pain for a long time. Joke aside, I had even cried. It took me one whole day before I dared to continue moving forward.”

Lei Xin pondered for a long time before he spoke softly.

They could never have thought that Qin Yu had suffered from Nightmare in the ninth level of purgatory. Under the protection of his father, he had no choice but to endure the intense pain of his soul being crushed in condensing the divine sense spirit bead. Therefore, the pain of the lightning refining his soul was nothing to him.

“Our guess is right. The chaotic body doesn’t have a specific attribute. Even with the power of thunder of Immortal Emperor Lei, his body doesn’t reject it. He’s absorbing this energy and refining his body. I’m curious how much the chaotic and Glazed Holy Body will grow. Perhaps he might not be inferior to my newly acquired disciple when the time comes.”

A rare smile appeared on Flower Granny’s face.

“You must be joking, Flower Granny. Although Ruoxue’s talent is outstanding, Qin Yu has constantly developed under my guidance. I think Qin Yu will develop to be the strongest when the time comes.”

Lei Xin’s beard puffed up. He was unhappy when he heard this.

At this moment, he was already within the last ten steps.

An immense suction force suddenly came from the ground, pulling Qin Yu’s entire body to the ground. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

The moment he stepped onto the ground, the ground suddenly lit up. A ray of light suddenly surged out from the immortal grave ten steps away.

The sound of surging waves suddenly appeared. After the light descended, it turned into a sea of thunder.

The sea of thunder slammed onto Qin Yu’s body like a tidal wave. In an instant, Qin Yu could even smell the charred smell on the surface of his body.

The terrifying rules of thunder dragon surged into his body from every cell of his body, like knives flowing against the current.

Then, it gathered at his heart and struck into his sea of consciousness.

Qin Yu let out a miserable cry. It was a hundred times more painful than when he was in the void and chaos. The power of rules seemed to have invaded his body directly and then erupted with the destructive power of thunder.

Under this attack, Qin Yu felt that 80% of the cells in his body had died by the sea of thunder’s attack.

He could even feel the pain of his heart tearing apart by just lifting a finger.

A tremendously pure chaotic power surged out from his spine, healing the terrifying injuries on his body.

After recovering, Qin Yu felt tremendously hungry, and every cell was incredibly excited.

Could it be?

Qin Yu revealed a puzzled expression.

When he walked ten steps away from the immortal grave, the power of lightning had already filled every cell in his body. However, after this strike, his body, on the contrary, felt a hunger for devouring spiritual energy.

Could it be that under the lightning refinement of Immortal Emperor Lei, the Glass Holy Body evolved again?

Qin Yu took another step forward. This time, the lightning’s power of rules was even more terrifying. However, just as Qin Yu had guessed, the Glazed Holy Body was devouring the terrifying power of lightning again.

Almost in an instant, his spine devoured all the power of lightning like a bottomless pit.

…

On the tenth day, Qin Yu finally reached the last step to the immortal grave.

At this moment, under the tempering of the power of thunder, the strength of his Glazed Holy Body and the capacity of spiritual energy had almost doubled. This terrifying advancement was simply exhilarating for Qin Yu.

The power of an Immortal Emperor was truly terrifying. His Glazed Holy Body was condensed after absorbing the Jee family’s peak spiritual essence.

However, the power of the Immortal Emperor allowed him to advance again. Moreover, these were the different energies Lei Ming had set up for the advancement of his descendants. If he were to release them, just how destructive would it be?

Suddenly, the immortal grave in front of him disappeared.

There was nothing in front of him. Cold sweat suddenly seeped out from Qin Yu’s temples.
