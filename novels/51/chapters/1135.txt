Chapter 1136: Chapter 1,136, War Machine 

In front of him, Yao Qing’s expression had become somewhat cold. At the same time, there was a hint of determination.

He had a head of short white hair and looked quite energetic.

As for his strength, he had already reached the half-step martial saint stage. He was actually only a step away from becoming a martial saint!

When Yao Qing saw the person in front of him clearly, he was instantly stunned.

He walked quickly to Qin Yu and said in a trembling voice, “You are... Mr. ... Mr. Qin? !”

Qin Yu did not waste any more words and pulled Yao Qing into his arms.

“Why the F * CK are you here! You haven’t contacted me for such a long time!”Qin Yu was both excited and angry.

Yao Qing also hugged Qin Yu’s back tightly and said in a low voice, “I thought you were dead.”

“You’re the one who’s F * CKING DEAD!”Qin Yu kicked his butt.

Yao Qing, who was in front of Qin Yu, immediately reverted back to his lowly appearance.

He grinned and said, “Back then, it was rumored that you were dead. When the tree fell, the monkeys scattered. Then, I had no choice but to run away.”

Qin Yu rolled his eyes and said, “F * CK Your Grandpa! I thought you had an accident.”

“Alright, let’s not talk here. Let’s go in quickly.”Yao Qing pulled Qin Yu and said.

The two of them walked into the big courtyard.

When they passed by the courtyard, Qin Yu could see that there were people training around them.

Although they were not very strong, their cultivation methods were very standard.

Obviously, these people were all Yao Qing’s disciples.

They walked into the room and sat down. Someone immediately poured tea for Qin Yu and Yao Qing.

“Alright, you guys can go out first.”Yao Qing waved his hand and said.

After sending everyone away, Qin Yu said impatiently, “Why didn’t you go back to look for me?”

Yao Qing said with a wry smile, “At that time, I had already given up hope. I really thought that something had happened to you. In order to prevent any accidents, it took me a lot of effort to find such a place.”

He pointed to the surroundings and said, “The information here is blocked. It’s completely like a paradise isolated from the outside world.”

“The news from the outside can’t come in, and the news from here can’t go out either.”

At this point, Yao Qing paused for a moment and asked in return, “By the way, how did you come to such a place?”

Qin Yu took a sip of tea and immediately told Yao Qing his purpose.

“I heard that there is a supreme-grade magic weapon here. I need this magic weapon very much right now,”said Qin Yu.

Yao Qing sneered, “Supreme-grade magic weapon? Do you think there is a supreme-grade magic weapon here?”

Qin Yu frowned, “But... Zhai Xing and pavilion master clearly told me that the magic weapon is here.”

“Impossible!”Yao Qing shook his head.

“I’ve been here for more than a year. I know everything here like the back of my hand.”

“This is a piece of wasteland, a piece of wasteland abandoned by the world. It’s already pretty good to be able to cultivate here. What kind of magic artifact do you expect to have?”

Qin Yu remained silent.

It wasn’t that he didn’t trust Yao Qing, but he was worried that with Yao Qing’s ability, he wouldn’t be able to discover that magic artifact.

“Forget it, I’ll bring you around.”Yao Qing simply stood up and said.

Qin Yu nodded slightly and agreed.

He had the desolate God’s eye, so he could discover treasures that others could not.

The Hidden Dragon Country was not considered big, and Qin Yu had the desolate God’s eye, so his sight could cover an extremely large area.

Therefore, the two did not spend too long to search the entire hidden dragon country.

Just as Yao Qing said, not to mention the spiritual artifacts, even the cultivation resources here were almost exhausted.

“Strange.”Qin Yu couldn’t help but frown slightly.

“Could it be that... they are lying to me?”

It didn’t make sense. Pavilion Master was Qin Yu’s most trusted person. How could she lie to him.

Everything needed a reason. Qin Yu sat on the sofa with a frown, combing through the whole incident from the beginning.

Soon, Qin Yu realized that something was wrong.

At that time, the pavilion master didn’t say a word, and Zhai Xing’s behavior was also extremely abnormal.

“Oh no!”Qin Yu suddenly stood up as if he had thought of something!

“They are probably afraid that something will happen to me, so... They deliberately sent me away!”

Thinking of this, Qin Yu looked at Yao Qing and said, “I have to go back immediately.”

“In such a hurry? I even asked someone to prepare dinner...”Yao Qing said in surprise.

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “I don’t have so much time. I Won’t eat dinner. I’ll leave now.”

After saying this, Qin Yu hurriedly got up and prepared to rush to the airport.

“I’ll go with you,”Yao Qing said hurriedly.

Qin Yu didn’t have time to argue with Yao Qing, so he nodded and agreed.

After arriving at the airport, Qin Yu found that the plane had long disappeared.

This more confirmed Qin Yu’s idea.

Such a long distance, wait for Qin Yu to walk back, I’m afraid the daylily is cold.

“Yao Qing, think of a way to help me get a plane to the fire country.”Qin Yu said in a cold pyro.

Yao Qing shook his head and said: “There is no plane here to Pyro.”

Qin Yu’s face changed slightly.

His eyes could not help looking at the planes parked in the airport.

As long as Qin Yu is willing, he can snatch a plane.

The laws of the Hidden Dragon Kingdom can not restrict Qin Yu at all.

“But I still have a way.”At this time, Yao Qing’s tone changed.

Qin Yu hurriedly looked at Yao Qing and said, “What method?”

“There is an extremely large family in the hidden dragon country. Their family has their own private jet. Perhaps, we can borrow it from them,”Yao Qing said.

“Then don’t waste time. Quickly find them,”Qin Yu said in a hurry.

However, Yao Qing shook his head and said, “They have never been on good terms with me. I’m afraid they won’t give me this face.”

“You are a half-step martial saint. You Don’t need to give them face. If they don’t give you face, they will take it,”Qin Yu said coldly.

Yao Qing said with slight embarrassment, “I would like to, but... They paid a high price to import a war machine from abroad. I am not a match for that war machine at all.”

Qin Yu frowned suddenly.

This Yao Qing was a half-step martial saint. How could that so-called war machine be so powerful? Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“Mr. Qin, don’t underestimate modern military weapons.”Yao Qing said in a deep voice.

Qin Yu’s face turned cold. He looked at Yao Qing and said, “Take me to them.”
