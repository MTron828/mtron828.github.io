Chapter 1410: Chapter 1,410: Quick Battle 1

With the support of the fifth level of the Dou word formula, Qin Yu’s entire body was filled with an extremely surging divine power.

The first Elder’s Aura had already been adjusted to the extreme. It could be seen that the first elder was already serious.

“Swoosh!”

At this moment, the first elder suddenly attacked. He gently pointed with his finger, and a beam of light shot towards Qin Yu’s chest.

Qin Yu hurriedly dodged to the side and used this opportunity to shoot towards the first elder.

When the first elder saw this, he could not help but snort coldly. Just as Qin Yu was about to approach, a huge force suddenly bounced Qin Yu away.

He did not know what kind of spell he used to be able to bounce back Qin Yu’s force.

Qin Yu retreated a few steps and finally stabilized his body.

He could not help but be a little surprised. The speed at which the first elder used the spell was a little too fast!

“Crash!”

The first elder did not say a single word. He used the tiptoeing spell and the sword rain that filled the sky immediately pounced on him!

Qin Yu did not dare to be negligent. He hurriedly let out an angry roar and clenched his fist to welcome the attack.

“Clang Clang Clang Clang!”

Countless sword sounds assaulted him. Qin Yu’s dark golden body was left with white marks by the sword rain.

The first elder seemed to have expected that this technique wouldn’t hurt Qin Yu. Therefore, he extended his palm and estimated that it would be the great heavenly seal again!

“The same technique won’t work after being used twice!”

Qin Yu shouted as his entire body erupted with an extremely powerful force as he punched at the Great Heavenly Seal!

“Boom!”

In that instant, the great heavenly seal was shattered.

Qin Yu was like a steel nail that pierced through the great heavenly seal!

The first elder immediately frowned. The Great Heavenly Seal was the Heavenly Cloud Sect’s ultimate technique. He did not expect that it could not hurt Qin Yu!

“HMPH.”The first elder’s expression was cold. He muttered a spell and immediately extended his palms!

“Withering Yellow Sacred Palm!”

Following the first elder’s explosive shout, a palm that was as yellow as a maple leaf rushed towards Qin Yu!

Qin Yu roared angrily and was about to clench his fist to receive the attack when he suddenly felt that something was wrong.

This palm seemed to be powerful, but he did not feel any pressure. There was probably a trick behind it!

Thinking of this, Qin Yu hurriedly stomped his feet and shot backwards!

That withered yellow palm brushed past Qin Yu’s face, and strands of long hair were hit by this palm.

That strand of long hair instantly lost its vitality like withered weeds.

Qin Yu frowned slightly and said in a low voice, “There really is a trap.”

The first elder narrowed his eyes, as if he didn’t expect Qin Yu to be so difficult to deal with.

He sneered and said, “Damn little bastard. If you didn’t kill the son of the sect master, my heavenly cloud sect would really want to take you in as a disciple.”

“Cut the crap. The Heavenly Cloud sect and I Won’t rest until one of us is dead,”Qin Yu said with a sneer.

“You don’t know life from Death!”

The first elder roared angrily, and his entire body was instantly plated with layers of light.

These layers of light were actually formed from Spirit Qi. The Spirit Qi in his body was released through his pores and stuck to his physical body!

In this way, not only did his physical body improve, but his strength was also vastly different!

“Sou!”

The first elder directly stretched out from the void and came close to him!

Qin Yu sneered, “You want to fight with my physical body? You Don’t know life from Death!”

He immediately clenched his fist to meet the attack, and the two sides began a melee battle!

For a moment, the sound of banging in the sky was incessant, and divine power rippled in this space.

This was a real physical body contest, and it was full of ornamental qualities. Everyone could not help but be stunned.

And the sect master of the Heavenly Cloud sect was sitting on the Cultivation Mountain, quietly looking at the void in front of him. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

What was shocking was that a picture actually appeared in the void in front of him.

And this picture was the battle between Qin Yu and the Great Elder!

He didn’t know what kind of magic treasure he used to actually be able to witness this battle with his own eyes!

“Sigh.”

Seeing Qin Yu’s valiant posture, the sect master could not help but sigh slightly.

“This Qin Yu was indeed poisoned by the Twilight Qi. His physical body has gradually recovered.”The sect master shook his head and said.

The deputy sect master at the side also nodded and said, “Although the first elder did not display his full strength, to be able to fight with the first elder to such an extent is really unbelievable.”

The sect master put his hands behind his back and said quietly, “If we let Qin Yu recover his spiritual power, the first elder is definitely not his match. If it wasn’t for the mistake in his judgment, Qin Yu... would definitely be ours.”

The deputy sect master didn’t say anything. They all knew that it was useless to say anything now.

Qin Yu killed the son of the sect master of the Heavenly Cloud sect. Even if the sect master was willing to forgive Qin Yu, the disciples of the Heavenly Cloud sect wouldn’t agree.

“Let’s end this quickly.”A moment later, the sect master muttered in a low voice.

“Bang!”

Accompanied by a loud sound, Qin Yu suddenly punched out and directly shattered the layer of spirit energy armor that covered the first elder’s body!

“Deng Deng Deng!”

The first elder took a few steps back, and the layers of armor disintegrated like glass shards.

He looked at Qin Yu who was full of fighting spirit in the sky, and his expression was extremely ugly.

“This little bastard...”the first elder couldn’t help but gnash his teeth.

Being forced back a few steps by Qin Yu, this was simply a humiliation!

“End the battle quickly, don’t waste any more time.”

Right at this moment, the sect master’s voice suddenly came from the sky.
