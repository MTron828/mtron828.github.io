1867 The Guardian Divine Beast Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

The Azure Dragon seemed to have become one with the sky and formed a connection with the Tong family by borrowing the Tong family’s terrifying mysterious power.

Under this power, the people of Demon-slaying Peak were unable to resist at all. In an instant, their bodies were pierced through and turned into ashes.

Qin Yu opened his arms and protected everyone under his body. The divine punishment landed continuously on Qin Yu’s golden arms, leaving behind huge bloody holes one after another!

Uncle Guan and the others sneered, looking at this scene.

!!

He clasped his hands behind his back and said indifferently, “This is The guardian divine beast left behind by the great ancestor. You’re still too inexperienced to deal with the Tong family!”

Qin Yu endured the terrifying force with great difficulty. Soon, his body was stained in blood and left with countless wounds.

“F*ck!” Chang Mang let out a furious roar as he charged out with the iron rod in his hand.

Chang Mang’s entire body emitted a blood-red light as he began to attack indiscriminately.

Everything in the Tong family seemed to have been destroyed under his powerful strength. Countless people turned into ashes under his iron rod. In an instant, they turned into scattered corpses!

Uncle Guan’s expression was cold. He waved his hand and bawled, “Kill him!”

Dozens of Reversion Void Stage cultivators came forth, and even Chang Mang couldn’t withstand their terrifying internal qi!

Qin Yu’s face was a bit ugly. He closed his eyes slightly, and with a thought, wisps of strange internal qi emitted from his body.

“The Emperor’s Sword!”

At this moment, Qin Yu suddenly shouted!

With Qin Yu’s shout, the world began to rumble, and the Great Dao began to gather in front of Qin Yu!

The so-called Emperor’s Sword was a divine sword formed by sensing the Path of Heaven!

This technique was passed down from Qin Yu’s father, the guardian of the Path of Heaven!

Only the guardians of the Path of Heaven would possess such a technique!

“Rumble…”

The Path of Heaven continued to condense in the sky. It was the true power of the Path of Heaven’s divine punishment. It was incomparably terrifying and could destroy everything in the world!

“Buzz!”

A crisp sound rang out, and a golden sword suddenly appeared in the sky!

The Emperor’s Sword took shape and slashed down from above!

The scarlet red clouds in the sky were instantly cut into two, and terrifying forces spread to the surroundings!

The terrifying sanctum formed by the Tong family’s guardian beast collapsed in an instant!

The descending divine punishment also began to disappear at this moment!

“Pitter-patter!”

It was as if blood rain was falling from the sky. The entire sanctum was filled with the smell of blood, and everyone’s clothes were wet from the blood rain.

Uncle Guan frowned. He reached out and grabbed something hard.

When he took a closer look, his face turned cold.

This hard object was none other than the Azure Dragon’s scales!

“Boom!”

Before Uncle Guan could feel shocked, the Azure Dragon’s huge head, which was almost destroyed, fell and landed in the center of the Tong family!

The Tong family’s guardian had fallen!

Qin Yu didn’t waste time. His body quickly resumed its normal size. He then stomped on the ground and rushed toward Uncle Guan!

Uncle Guan’s expression was extremely cold. He stretched out his palm and took out a big seal, trying to suppress Qin Yu with it.

However, Qin Yu’s strength was terrifying! The golden light cut through everything, and the seal was directly shattered!

Qin Yu’s huge fist arrived in front of Uncle Guan in an instant!

Uncle Guan’s expression changed. He opened his mouth and spat out a huge green tree, and the green tree was emitting a green radiance.

Under this radiance, Qin Yu’s strength was instantly removed. Uncle Guan took his opportunity to hit Qin Yu with another big seal.

“Boom!”

Qin Yu was forced back a few steps. He frowned and looked at the ancient green tree in his hand.

This power was rather strange, and it was somewhat similar to the technique Tong Haoyang had previously used.

Holding the mysterious green tree, Uncle Guan shouted, “Little b*stard! You actually killed my Tong family’s divine guardian beast. You must die here today!”

After saying that, Uncle Guan lifted the ancient tree with one hand. Waves of water wave green radiance swept toward Qin Yu!

Qin Yu knew that this ancient tree was not simple. Although it was not as powerful as a Saint Weapon, it was not to be underestimated.

Therefore, he instantly activated the Saintly Body Technique and crossed his arms in front of him.

“Clang!”

The moment they came into contact, Qin Yu’s body was forced back a few steps, leaving spots on his arms.

“See how I suppress you!”

Uncle Guan shouted and threw the ancient tree in his hand lightly.

The ancient tree was growing larger, and a terrifying suppressive force fell on Qin Yu!

Qin Yu looked up at the ancient tree and shouted. He raised his arms and received the ancient tree!

The ancient tree was exuding a strange power. Under this power, Qin Yu felt his body become extremely weak, and his body was constantly suppressed!

...

“Ah!”

Qin Yu raised his head and shouted. His black hair was dancing in the wind and his blood was surging. Nothing seemed to be able to stop him!

He relied on that powerful body and pushed back this green tree!

“Buzz!”

At this moment, a divine arrow shot toward the ancient bronze tree!

The divine arrow contained the might of the Great Dao. It was incredibly terrifying. Immortal power was condensed on it as if it had passed through the ages.

“Boom!”

The divine arrow pierced through the ancient tree and actually shattered it!

Turning around, Qin Yu saw the attacker, Jiu Xiao, holding a bow in his hand. Mysterious runes and a large number of mysterious creatures were engraved on the bow.

“Thank you very much.” Qin Yu had no time to feel shocked by the secret treasure in Jiu Xiao’s hand. After thanking him, he looked at Uncle Guan again.

However, sensing something was wrong, Uncle Guan immediately fled into the void, disappearing without a trace.

...

Without Uncle Guan, the backbone, many hangers-on of the Tong family were nothing at all.

The cultivators of Demon-slaying Peak were filled with the terrifying battle intent. The entire Tong family was in a tragic state, and even the sky was dyed blood-red!

“Hahaha!”

Seeing this, Qin Yu couldn’t help but laugh.

“Kill them! Who cares what aristocratic family they are from? Just kill them to your heart’s content!” Qin Yu shouted.

“What Zhongzhou aristocratic family? We will trample them under our feet!”

It was as if everyone was infected. Their bodies exuded endless battle intent as if they were desperately venting out injustice.

On the other end, hiding in the dark, Uncle Guan had gone all the way to the deepest part of the Tong family.

Sitting upright, Tong Lianyang did not look flustered at all.

On the other hand, Tong Guangqing was trembling beside him as if he was extremely frightened.

“The guardian divine beast is dead. The ancient bronze tree has also been shattered.” Uncle Guan’s face was extremely ugly.

Tong Lianyang squinted his eyes, sighed, and said, “I didn’t expect that Demon-slaying Peak would visit my Tong family…”

“It’s all because of that Qin Yu!” Tong Guangqing’s eyes were wide open as he gritted his teeth and said.
