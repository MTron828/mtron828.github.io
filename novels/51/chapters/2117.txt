2118 The Peak Duel (1)

Si Liuhe’s strong battle intent naturally moved many people.

The terrifying strength of that living being was obvious, but Si Liuhe did not back down and fight. It was indeed shocking!

“The strength of these living beings has long surpassed the True Saint cultivation realm. If he’s not careful, he might die here.”

“That’s right. However, those living beings can’t leave the sanctum. With Si Liuhe’s ability, he should be able to protect himself.”

While everyone was discussing, Si Liuhe made his move!

He raised his palm, and thousands of dao techniques gathered. Invisible Holy Power spread, and boundless power seemed to have gathered on his body!

At the same time, a tremendous radiance hung behind him. The radiance condensed and formed thousands of scenes!

The scenes were ever-changing, like a stormy sea. There were the rising sun and moon, the stars, the magnificent mountains and rivers, the boundless oceans, the rolling thunder under the sky, the burning flames in the abyss, the wind-blowing sand in the desert, and the stampeding of thousands of beasts in the forest. The scenes were so vast and magnificent that it was like another world, completely filling up the space behind Si Liuhe.

The scenes were like the creation of the world. It was as if the Tree of Life was growing behind him. Its roots were deep into the ground, and its branches were luxuriant. Every leaf condensed a world. The fruits on the tree were sparks of life. They flickered with light and emitted endless vitality.

A dazzling star hung at the very top of the Tree of Life. It illuminated the vast world as if it controlled the power of life.

Si Liuhe looked like a supreme god in this magnificent scene. The formation in his hand kept expanding like an enormous black hole, ready to absorb those meteors.

At that moment, countless people felt incomparably shocked. They knew that the scene before them had far exceeded their understanding. It was no longer the world they knew. It was a brand new, unknown domain.

Si Liuhe was like a real god of creation in front of that living being. Every move he made seemed to be creating a new world. Every move he made was irresistibly shocking!

At that moment, everyone understood they had witnessed incomprehensible but tremendously real power. It was a shock they had never experienced, a power that surpassed all imagination.

“The power of Si Liuhe’s domain after stepping into True Saint Realm was too terrifying!”

Under this enormous scene, everyone felt a tremor. The overflowed pressure almost made everyone shiver!

“Is this Si Liuhe’s strength? He truly deserves the title of a genius back then!” Someone sighed with emotion.

“Once Si Liuhe achieves Great Success, the most powerful individual in this world will undoubtedly hold a place for himself!

“Who dares to fight Si Liuhe now?”

With the power of the domain, Si Liuhe’s every move was full of great force, constantly clashing with the living being in the sanctum!

The world constantly rumbled as if it was about to shatter the world completely!

The void constantly trembled, and the dao technique within it no longer existed. Everything seemed to have been reborn.

Every attack moved heaven and earth. The powerful force seemed to tear the void apart and destroy everything.

As Si Liuhe’s attacks became even more fierce, the world behind him became even more shocking.

The sun and the moon alternated, mountains and rivers overturned, oceans churned, thunder rolled, flames burned, desert winds blew the sand, and thousands of beasts surged in the forest. The scene was as shocking as the end of the world!

In the midst of all this, Si Liuhe was like a god. With a wave of his hand, he could control all things and move the world. The Tree of Life continued to grow behind him. The world of each leaf was bursting with even more brilliant radiance. It was like a small universe, constantly expanding and changing.

The dazzling star was shining brightly at the top of the Tree of Life. The starlight shone down and illuminated the entire world as if it was going to transcend the shackles of life and burst forth with unimaginable power!

The aftermath of the battle raged in this world. The clouds in the sky blew away, the earth shook to the point of numerous abysses opening up, and even the mountains collapsed from the tremors.

Fortunately, it was at the Chaos Grave. Everything that had collapsed was restored in an instant. Otherwise, this place would have been reduced to ruins!

In this scene, Liu Liuhe was like a god descending into the world. Whenever he attacked, he seemed to be creating or destroying a world. The magnificent scene was like an epic description, causing unprecedented shock to everyone.

Such a scene made people feel endlessly powerless and insignificant. They were like watching a mythical legend that was unbelievable but incomparably real.

The battle seemed to have rebuilt a whole new world. Everyone watching was shocked. They had also seen Si Liuhe’s true power. It was beyond imagination, but it was real.

An elderly man in the crowd said with a trembling voice, “Could this be the true chosen one? I’ve never seen such power in my life.” Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

The young man beside him widened his eyes and looked at Si Liuhe in the sky. His voice trembled as he said, “I’ve never thought humans could display such power. Is… Is this the True Saint Realm?”

A slightly older middle-aged man clenched his fists and took a deep breath. He said in shock, “Si Liuhe isn’t just a True Saint. He has already surpassed True Saint. His power has reached an indescribable level. Undoubtedly, this is the strongest expert I’ve ever seen!”

Even Teng Zixu’s face revealed a hint of shock. He was also a True Saint but seemed to feel a little pressure.

The battle lasted hundreds of rounds, and the world collapsed countless times. Finally, Si Liuhe seemed to have completely angered that living being!

Si Liuhe was like a god standing in the vast expanse of the heavens and earth, facing the living being in the sanctum.

The living being’s expression grew increasingly colder, and thousands of internal qi surged toward this sanctum as if they were about to unleash some extremely terrifying spell!

The living being’s figure gradually became blurry. He seemed to have been wrapped in countless streams of light, becoming unattainable and unfathomable. The air in the sanctum instantly froze as if it was yearning and yet feeling afraid of the forth-coming attack.

The living being’s eyes flashed with a chilling light. He raised his hand, and that hand drew a deep trajectory in the air as if it had cut open the world and summoned the power of chaos.
