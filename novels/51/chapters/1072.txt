Chapter 1073: Chapter 1,073, cursing 

Qin Yu stretched out a strand of his divine sense, intending to enter the picture.

But at this time, Zhai Xing stopped Qin Yu and shook his head. “I have to tell you in advance that once your divine sense enters, it will take at least a month.”

“During this month, your main body can not do anything and will face danger at the same time.”

Hearing this, Qin Yu immediately frowned.

One month’s time? This was too long.

Right now, Qin Yu was on the cusp of a storm. No one could guarantee that there wouldn’t be any changes in this one month. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Qin Yu withdrew his divine sense. He stared at the picture and said in a low voice, “It seems that I can’t enter it for the time being.”

The second secret realm had just been destroyed. There were too many changes.

“I know.”Qin Yu nodded to Zhai Xing.

Zhai Xing didn’t say anything more. He turned around and was about to leave.

At this time, Qin Yu grabbed Zhai Xing’s arm and said, “Where do you plan to go?”

“I don’t know.”Zhai Xing shook his head.

Qin Yu smiled and said, “In that case, why don’t you stay?”

“Stay?”Zhai Xing frowned slightly.

Qin Yu grunted and said, “This second secret realm has just been obtained. It’s the time when we’re lacking people. Stay.”

Zhai Xing glanced at immortal crane and said, “You have so many capable people around you. Why Do You Need Me?”

Immortal crane said coldly, “I’m only here to help. I’ll leave soon.”

Qin Yu smiled and said, “It’s settled then. There’s no need to argue anymore.”

“Moreover, I’ll go to the so-called first mystic realm sooner or later. Don’t you want to know what the world of a mighty figure is like?”

Zhai Xing was stunned for a moment and immediately fell into silence.

A moment later, he nodded and said, “Alright, then thank you very much.”

With Zhai Xing’s assistance, Qin Yu was indeed much lighter.

After returning to the main hall, immortal crane seemed to have the intention to leave.

“Since I can’t enter the first mystic realm as soon as possible, there’s no point for me to stay here,”said immortal crane.

Qin Yu frowned and said, “Are you leaving already? Aren’t you in too much of a hurry?”

“Why? Can’t bear to part with me?”Immortal Crane said somewhat provocatively.

“Go to Hell.”Qin Yu rolled his eyes.

Immortal Crane laughed out loud. He stood up and said, “Alright, it’s time for me to enter seclusion. Although it’s very difficult to become a mighty figure, it doesn’t mean that I don’t have a chance.”

When Qin Yu heard this, he immediately cried out in alarm, “You want to attempt to break through to a mighty figure?”

“Perhaps.”Immortal Crane stood up and said.

“Alright, there’s no need to send me off. I’m leaving.”Immortal Crane waved his hand. He transformed into a gust of wind and turned to leave. He was quite carefree and didn’t even give Qin Yu a chance to say goodbye.

Looking in the direction where the crane left, Qin Yu said in a low voice, “It’s time for me to think about the path I’m going to take next.”

...

The second mystic realm temporarily fell into silence.

The outside world was still discussing Qin Yu’s great battle.

On this day.

Jiang he suddenly came to the second mystic realm from the Heaven Gate.

“The meeting is about to start in the Military District.”Jiang he handed an invitation letter to Qin Yu.

Qin Yu took the invitation letter and glanced at it. He saw that the time and place were written on it.

The name of the meeting was “Mystical Realm Meeting”. The people invited were mostly the masters of the mystical realms and martial families.

Qin Yu felt a little headache. He threw the invitation letter back to Jiang he and said, “Senior Jiang he, it’s better for you to attend this kind of thing.”

Jiang he shook his head and said, “The higher-ups specifically asked you to go personally.”

Qin Yu immediately felt a trace of helplessness.

Once a person became famous, all kinds of troublesome things would come up.

“I really don’t know what the purpose of this meeting is,”Qin Yu muttered.

“The second secret realm is gone. The future development of the martial arts association in Jingdu will naturally need to be discussed and decided,”said Jiang he.

“Go ahead. I’m sure all the famous people in the martial arts world will participate.”

Qin Yu grunted and said with a bitter smile, “I can’t not go either.”

The meeting time was set for the morning of the next day, and the venue was the meeting room of the martial arts association in Jingdu.

At night.

Qin Yu lay on the bed, his hand stroking the token that Yan Ruoxue had sent over.

“I wonder how she is now,”Qin Yu murmured in a low voice.

Thoughts welled up in his heart, like a hundred claws scratching his heart. He felt extremely uncomfortable.

“I really can’t wait to see the world. What exactly is it like?”Qin Yu sighed slightly.

No one knew how many experts there were and how many top-notch geniuses there were.

However, Qin Yu was very clear in his heart that it was definitely a wider world. All the top-notch people in the world would gather to compete for it.

“Wait for me...”Qin Yu’s hand tightly grabbed the jade pendant.

The next day.

Qin Yu left the second mystic realm early in the morning and came to the vicinity of the conference room.

At this moment, many unfamiliar faces had already appeared here.

“Greetings, Mr. Qin!”Someone walked forward to greet Qin Yu.

“I really didn’t expect that the second mystic realm would be destroyed by Mr. Qin’s hands. What an unprecedented move!”

“We also have extreme respect for Mr. Qin!”

Qin Yu responded one by one, appearing somewhat helpless.

This kind of worldly wisdom had always been a difficult problem for Qin Yu.

Seeing that the crowd near the conference room was increasing, the realm lords of the various mystic realms seemed to have arrived.

At this moment, Qin Yu saw a familiar figure.

This person was none other than Yan Jinyao.

Their eyes met, and a strange spark instantly burst forth. Even the air became a little anxious.

The surrounding people also felt the collision of this internal Qi. They all stepped back, and in a short while, an empty path was created.

“Look at you, you F * cking idiot!”

Qin Yu glared at Yan Jinyao and cursed.
