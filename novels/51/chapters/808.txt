Chapter 809: Chapter 809, Save Yan Ruoxue! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

The second mystic realm was extremely large, and there were towering mountains everywhere.

And in the center of this mystic realm, there were many houses located here.

The mountains here were even more majestic.

This place was not as noisy as the outside world, but rather rather desolate.

But the Qi/spiritual energy here was extremely comfortable.

When she arrived here, the young girl immediately stopped in her tracks.

“I can’t get close...”the young girl said.

She pointed at a large mountain not far away and said, “That’s the Heavenly Mystery Cliff.”

Qin Yu looked in the direction the young girl pointed and indeed saw a tall mountain that towered into the clouds.

Qin Yu focused his gaze and saw that there were countless people guarding the peak of the mountain.

In the middle of the mountain peak, there was a young girl who was tied to a pillar.

Her body was riddled with injuries and she looked extremely weak.

This young girl was none other than Yan Ruoxue!

“Ruoxue!”Qin Yu’s expression suddenly changed drastically and the internal Qi on his body erupted in an instant!

“Be careful. Don’t let them discover us or we’ll be dead for sure.”The young girl hurriedly stopped Qin Yu.

Qin Yu’s eyes were wide open as he stared fixedly at that spot.

He shook off the young girl, gritted his teeth and said, “I want to kill all of them. Kill all of them!”

Qin Yu’s killing intent was completely unable to be restrained at this moment!

His figure burst forth as he dashed towards the heavenly mystery cliff!

The people guarding the heavenly mystery cliff quickly discovered Qin Yu who was approaching them!

They were all at the peak of the Martial Marquis realm and their strength was unimaginable!

Faced with the sudden appearance of Qin Yu, everyone instantly entered a state of alert.

“Stop, what are you...”

“Pa!”

Before he could finish speaking, Qin Yu’s golden fist directly shattered his head!

A great battle was about to break out!

The numerous martial marquises guarding the heavenly mystery cliff attacked at this moment and shot towards Qin Yu!

However, Qin Yu, who controlled the power of a martial saint, was not afraid of them.

His body was covered in golden light and he looked like an undefeatable god of war. His methods were extremely ruthless. With every punch he threw, a person’s head would explode!

Qin Yu’s eyes seemed to have turned red from killing. In just ten minutes, the sky mystery cliff had already turned into a river of blood and corpses littered the ground!

For a moment, everyone did not even dare to approach Qin Yu!

Qin Yu Glared at everyone and berated, “Get the F * ck out of my way!”

With a loud roar, he actually shouted at everyone!

Qin Yu strode forward and arrived directly in front of Yan Ruoxue.

Yan Ruoxue opened her eyes with difficulty and looked at Qin Yu who was covered in blood. The corner of her mouth murmured, and she said in a low voice, “Qin Yu, it’s so good to see you again...”

Qin Yu’s heart felt as if it was being cut by a knife!

He gritted his teeth and said, “If you need me, I’ll bring you out right now!”

After saying that, a world-shaking power surged from Qin Yu’s fist!

Such power could not help but shock people!

“Boom!”

In the next second, Qin Yu threw a punch at the towering pillar that pierced through the clouds!

However, this pillar was extremely hard and did not move at all!

Qin Yu did not stop. He roared furiously as he threw punch after punch at the Pillar!

“Crack!”

At this moment, the pillar let out a crisp sound!

Pieces of broken rocks fell from the top!

Everyone was shocked when they saw this!

If this continued, he might really break the pillar!

“Crack!”

Another punch!

Qin Yu’s veins bulged as if he had gone mad. Golden Light illuminated the world as a terrifying power poured out!

Under this punch, the pillar collapsed!

Everyone was shocked by this scene!

Qin Yu actually shattered this pillar!

At this moment, Yan Ruoxue also fell down from the pillar!

Qin Yu picked up Yan Ruoxue and said with a pained expression, “Ruoxue, I’ll take you away now...”

Yan Ruoxue opened her mouth with difficulty. She wanted to say something, but she seemed to have lost her strength.

Qin Yu picked up Yan Ruoxue and said in a trembling voice, “Ruoxue, don’t say anything. Wait for us to get out. We can talk about it later.”

Then, Qin Yu carried Yan Ruoxue and turned around to leave.

“Stop right there!”Someone tried to stop Qin Yu, but his head was smashed by Qin Yu’s fist! Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

His speed was extremely fast as he desperately rushed towards the exit!

At this moment, Qin Yu suddenly looked at the young girl who was leading the way for him.

Qin Yu immediately rushed forward and grabbed her in his hand.

“Follow Me Out,”Qin Yu said coldly.

Before the young girl could speak, Qin Yu had already sped away.

The reason why he brought this young girl was because Qin Yu wanted to use her to figure out the second mystic realm.

The surrounding people immediately shouted, “Yan Ruoxue has been taken away!”

Qin Yu’s expression was ice-cold, and his footsteps became faster and faster.

He knew clearly in his heart that there must be top experts hidden in this second mystic realm, and there was even a Marquis Wu guarding it!

If he was caught up, then he definitely wouldn’t have the chance to escape!

Qin Yu was getting closer and closer to the exit. Ten kilometers, eight kilometers, five kilometers...

Soon, Qin Yu was only a few hundred meters away from the exit!

Qin Yu gritted his teeth. He hugged Yan Ruoxue and fled frantically towards the exit!
