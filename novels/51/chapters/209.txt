Chapter 210: The Jiang Family Surrenders Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Qin Yu fainted again, as if he was overwhelmed by happiness.

Yan Ruoxue couldn’t bear to leave for a moment.

She wanted to stay and accompany Qin Yu.

But if she stayed, Qin Yu wouldn’t grow.

“Miss, we really should go.” Outside the door, there was another hurried voice.

Yan Ruoxue nodded slowly. She got up and walked out of the door.

Every two steps she took, she looked back.

But this time, Qin Yu didn’t wake up again.

Yan Ruoxue returned to Jingdu, but the Martial Arts Association still didn’t stop torturing Yuan Hong.

Yuan Hong had passed out countless times, but every time, he was forcefully woken up by Yan Jiang.

An entire day passed, and in the evening, Yan Jiang received a call from Yan Ruoxue.

“I don’t want to see this person again,” Yan Ruoxue said coldly over the phone.

“Yes, Miss,” Yan Jiang understood.

After he hung up the phone, he looked at Yuan Hong.

Updates by

“Yuan Hong, you’re free.” A murderous air emanated from Yan Jiang’s body.

Yuan Hong actually had no fear when facing death.

This kind of torture that was worse than death made him wish he could die sooner.

After Yuan Hong died, his corpse wasn’t left behind.

Within a day, the power dynamics had changed in Chuzhou.

In the cage of the Martial Arts Association, all the prisoners had received the news.

“That’s great. I knew Mr. Qin wouldn’t die!”

“Haha, have you heard? Yuan Hong seems to have been fired.”

“All these years, that bastard Yuan Hong used his power for personal gain and bullied others. He should have been fired a long time ago!”

Cheers reverberated in the cage.

On the other side, Jiang Gu’s expression was extremely gloomy.

His heart was filled with extreme fear.

Jiang Gu’s fear towards the aristocratic families in Jingdu came from the bottom of his heart.

“I really didn’t know that the Yan family would make a move...” Mr. Zhong knelt on the ground and begged bitterly.

Viciousness flashed through Jiang Gu’s eyes.

He stood up angrily and berated, “It was because of you that Haoran died! The Jiang family also fell into eternal damnation!”

Mr. Zhong’s body trembled and he said in anguish, “It’s my fault. It’s my fault. Master, please spare my life on account that I’ve followed you for so many years...”

Almost everyone in the Jiang family was pleading mercy for Mr. Zhong.

Jiang Gu was silent for a moment. He glanced at Mr. Zhong and waved his hand. “Forget it. I’ve already lost a son. I don’t want to lose anyone else.”

“Thank you! Thank you!” Mr. Zhong immediately felt as if he had been pardoned and kept kowtowing.

In the blink of an eye, night arrived.

However, Jiang Gu couldn’t sleep at night.

The predicament that the Jiang family was facing gave Jiang Gu a headache.

“What should we do now?” Mr. Zhong said with a trembling voice.

Jiang Gu sighed and muttered in a low voice, “With Qin Yu’s talent, one day he will become a giant. Since we can’t kill him, we must ease our relationship with him as soon as possible.”

Rather than worrying about the Yan family, Jiang Gu was more afraid of Qin Yu in the future!

“Ease our relationship?” Mr. Zhong was stunned.

“But... will Qin Yu agree?” Mr. Zhong was a little uneasy.

From his understanding of Qin Yu, this kid would never give up easily.

Jiang Gu waved his hand weakly and said, “We can only do whatever it takes to survive. No matter what request he makes, we will agree to him.”

The head of the Jiang family yielding undoubtedly meant that the situation in Chuzhou had changed.

From now on, the top dog of Chuzhou would no longer be the Jiang family.

...

The next day, Qin Yu woke up from his bed in a daze.

The people sitting in front of him were the top nurses of the provincial capital.

When they saw Qin Yu wake up, they quickly got up and asked, “Mr. Qin, how do you feel?”

Qin Yu didn’t answer. His eyes scanned the surroundings, and he said somewhat anxiously, “Where’s Ruoxue? Where is she?”

The nurses looked at each other and replied respectfully, “Miss Yan has already left. She also left a message for you.”

“A message?” Qin Yu’s eyes lit up while he indicated for them to continue.

“Miss Yan said that she would wait for you in Jingdu,” the nurse replied truthfully.

Hearing this, Qin Yu felt his entire body filled with vigor.

Faith was perhaps the most powerful force.

It could support everyone through the darkest times.

At this moment, there was a sudden movement outside the door.

After turning his head, he saw Jiang Gu and Mr. Zhong standing at the door.

In their hands, there were gifts.

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and said coldly, “What are you doing here?”

Jiang Gu walked to Qin Yu quickly. He waved his hand and motioned for the nurse to leave.

After the nurse left, Jiang Gu suddenly kneeled on the ground with a plop.

“Mr. Qin, I, Jiang Gu, was ignorant to have crossed you. Please forgive me for my offense,” Jiang Gu said respectfully.

This surprised Qin Yu.

He sized up Jiang Gu and said with a nonchalant smile, “Jiang Gu, what tricks are you playing now?”

Jiang Gu was terrified and hurriedly said, “I won’t dare to. Mr. Qin, I sincerely want to apologize to you.”

“Apologize?” Qin Yu sneered again and again.

He sat up from the bed and said coldly, “Now you want to make peace? Why? What happened to your arrogant attitude from back then?”

Jiang Gu felt resentment and frustration. How could he know that Qin Yu had ties with the Yan family?!

If he had known earlier, Jiang Gu would never have offended Qin Yu!

“Mr. Qin, it’s my fault for not knowing my place. Please forgive me...” Jiang Gu sighed.

Looking at Jiang Gu, Qin Yu couldn’t help but squint his eyes.

After thinking for a moment, he sneered. “I refuse.”

Jiang Gu’s expression changed slightly. He gritted his teeth and suddenly said, “Mr. Qin, from today onwards, the Jiang family is willing to submit to you!”

Qin Yu was stunned.

This was completely beyond Qin Yu’s imagination! 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Jiang Gu actually voluntarily submitted to him?

“Are you afraid of the Yan family or me?” Qin Yu frowned and asked.

Jiang Gu was stunned and didn’t know how to answer for a moment.

“Answer truthfully,” Qin Yu said.

Jiang Gu raised his head. He thought for a moment and said, “Both, but I’m more optimistic about your potential.”

Jiang Gu’s idea was very simple. If he couldn’t kill Qin Yu, he might as well establish a good relationship with Qin Yu as soon as possible.

With Qin Yu’s potential, he would definitely become a top dog in the future. At that time, the Jiang family might expand outside of Chuzhou!

Qin Yu thought for a moment and nodded. “Okay, Jiang Gu. I hope you don’t have the intention to rebel, or else...”

“I won’t dare to!” Jiang Gu hurriedly kowtowed!

Qin Yu indeed had the intention of finding powerful allies.

With his current strength, his future cultivation would certainly become more and more difficult.

Moreover, it was indeed unrealistic to think of venturing into Jingdu by himself.

He said that he was surrendering, but in fact, they were using each other.

Qin Yu helped Jiang Gu up and said in a sullen voice, “Let’s go. Since you’ve already submitted to me, I’m willing to save your son.”

At the mention of Jiang Haoran, a sorrowful look flashed in Jiang Gu’s eyes.

“No... There’s no need.” Jiang Gu waved his hand.

Qin Yu frowned and said in puzzlement, “You don’t believe me?”

“Mr. Qin, the eldest young master is... already dead!” Mr. Zhong sighed.
