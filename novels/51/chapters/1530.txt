Chapter 1531: Chapter 1,531, the great battle against the Guardian of the Dao! 1

It was as if a bright flower had bloomed on the ground, bewitching and beautiful.

Qin Yu looked at Yan Ruoxue’s corpse on the ground, feeling somewhat sad in his heart.

“Qin Yu, you...”Chang Mang pointed at Qin Yu, his eyes filled with disbelief.

Qin Yu looked coldly at Chang Mang and said, “I know that all of this is fake. This is just the heavenly tribulation. Without you guys around, Sima Bei didn’t die, and the heavenly tribulation didn’t disappear.”

After hearing Qin Yu’s words, Chang Mang’s expression disappeared.

His body also slowly became dim, until it disappeared without a trace.

Everything around him also returned to normal in an instant.

There was no sunlight, and a dark cloud still covered the earth.

Not far away, Sima Bei was still confronting Zhuo Jing.

The only difference was that the light that lingered around Qin Yu’s body slowly disappeared.

That warm feeling had long disappeared without a trace.

Qin Yu raised his head to look at the sky and sneered, “This technique is useless against me.”

These words seemed to have angered the heavens.

......

An extremely ear-piercing rumbling sound was emitted from the dark clouds.

However, all of this could not affect Qin Yu’s Dao Heart. He closed his eyes slightly and his heart was extremely calm as he waited for the next heavenly tribulation to descend.

Not far away, Zhuo Jing could not hold on any longer.

All of his internal Qi was gathered on this chain.

And now, that chain seemed to be about to break free at any moment.

“If I Were you, I would take this opportunity to escape,”Sima Bei said coldly.

Zhuo jing grinned and said, “If I knew how to escape, I would have escaped long ago.”

“I admire your spirit of facing death with ease. Once I break free from this chain, you will die without a doubt. I will destroy your soul!”Sima bei said coldly.

“That will have to wait until you break free.”Zhuo Jing replied in a neither servile nor overbearing manner.

As he spoke, the dark clouds once again emitted a radiance.

This time, the radiance was still very fast, and in an instant, it engulfed Qin Yu.

What was different was that this radiance was no longer as steady as the sun’s rays. Instead, it was bone-piercing cold.

The pitch-black radiance enveloped Qin Yu’s entire body.

Within this light, Qin Yu could clearly feel an extremely intense killing intent.

“The ninth heavenly tribulation should be about to end, right?”Qin Yu said coldly.

He stared at the surrounding light, his heart unusually calm.

But in the next second, Qin Yu’s expression changed, becoming extremely ugly!

Because from this black light, a man walked out.

He had a tall and sturdy figure, and his internal Qi was incomparably powerful!

When Qin Yu saw his face clearly, he felt a chill run down his back!

This was because this person was none other than Qin Yu’s father! Earth’s guardian of the Dao!

“Father... father, how could it be you!”Qin Yu’s eyes widened.

However, this guardian in front of him seemed to have no emotions at all. All he had was that ice-cold killing intent.

He walked toward Qin Yu step by step, and his every move contained an extremely powerful internal Qi.

Boom

Just as Qin Yu was in a daze, the Guardian made his move.

He raised his hand and unleashed the absolute beginning Sacred Fist, heading straight for Qin Yu’s face!

Qin Yu hurriedly dodged to the side, calmly analyzing everything in front of him.

“Could this be the heavenly tribulation as well?”Qin Yu gasped.

Could it be that he had to defeat the Dao-guardian in order to successfully overcome the heavenly tribulation?

If that was the case, Qin Yu had no chance of winning at all!

“Boom!”

The second punch arrived as scheduled. Its power was unparalleled, and it could be said to be able to destroy anything.

But even so, Qin Yu still saw through the clues.

As he dodged, he squinted his eyes to observe the dao-guardian.

All the spells of the Guardian in front of him were exactly the same as Qin Yu’s. He knew everything that Qin Yu knew!

But what made Qin Yu feel that something was wrong was that the Guardian in front of him was far from being as powerful as he had imagined!

“I understand.”Qin Yu took a deep breath.

“The Guardian in front of me is a guardian from the same era as me.”

“In other words, his realm is the same as mine.”

A smile appeared on the corner of Qin Yu’s mouth. Then, he said in a low voice, “Father, we are in the same era. Even if it’s you, I’m not afraid. Come, let’s have a good fight!”

After seeing everything clearly, Qin Yu was no longer afraid. On the contrary, he was extremely excited and full of fighting spirit!

He no longer dodged and also activated a spell. He held the absolute beginning Sacred Fist and clashed with the dao-guardian!

The great battle began in that instant. Both of them used the same magical technique, and they clashed fiercely.

Every time they clashed, a powerful shockwave swept out in all directions. It was as if they had become ancient war gods, and all they wanted was a life-and-death battle!

Boom

The two fists collided fiercely, causing the surrounding void to collapse. Before they could even catch their breath, the second clash had already arrived!

Both of their bodies were dyed red with blood, but the more they fought, the braver they became, and their internal Qi was incomparably powerful!

“As expected of father. Even among the same level, he can be on par with me.”Qin Yu was secretly shocked in his heart!

As expected, those who could become the recipient were all unparalleled geniuses!

This great battle continued. Qin Yu used all his trump cards, and all the spells he knew were unleashed without reservation in this great battle.

The battle between father and son could not be decided at all. Even a nascent soul realm guardian made it extremely difficult for Qin Yu to fight!

At first glance, the two of them seemed to be evenly matched, and it was difficult to decide the victor.

At this moment, the Guardian began to evolve his dao technique. He also summoned the power of his domain and crushed toward Qin Yu. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

This gave Qin Yu a huge headache. He had not comprehended the power of his domain, and he did not know how to deal with it. He could only rely on his brute strength to forcefully resist.

“Father had already comprehended the DAO technique when he was at this realm.”Qin Yu was getting more and more shocked as the battle went on. A trace of inferiority rose in his heart!

One had to know that the Dao Guardian in front of him was not a real dao guardian. Instead, he was just a figure formed by the Heavenly Tribulation!

If a real dao guardian were to descend, Qin Yu would probably have an even harder battle!

In the distance, the chains on Sima Bei’s body were rattling. There was a deafening sound.

Zhuo Jing’s forehead was dripping with sweat. He couldn’t hold on any longer.

“Qin Yu, how much longer do you need...”Zhuo Jing muttered in pain. However, he didn’t dare to be distracted. If he was distracted for even a moment, the chains would probably shatter immediately!

“Resist stubbornly,”Sima Bei said coldly.

His entire body shook violently, and cracks started to appear on the chains on his body!

Sima bei struck while the iron was hot. His internal Qi exploded to the extreme, and a terrifying power exploded from his body!

This power swept out in all directions, and Zhuo Jing was the first to bear the brunt.

Zhuo Jing, who was already extremely weak, was instantly sent flying under the impact of this power.

The chains on Sima Bei’s body finally couldn’t bear it any longer, and emitted a “Crack”sound before shattering into powder!
