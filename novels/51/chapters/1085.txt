Chapter 1086: Chapter 1,086. I never said that I would let you off 

Under the light, Yan Jinyao no longer lived up to his words. The white ash on his fist began to crack, and then it directly shattered!

The enormous fist force shook toward Yan Jinyao, forcing him to retreat repeatedly! FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

At this moment, Qin Yu rose up from the ground. He raised his palm, and a golden light instantly blotted out the sky and covered the earth!

The gigantic golden palm print was like a millstone as it ruthlessly lashed out at Yan Jinyao!

“Bang!”

Under this slap, the white ash on Yan Jinyao’s body began to shatter once again, level by level falling off!

Without the support of the Almighty’s bones, Yan Jinyao’s physical body was instantly exposed. He had lost the right to compete with Qin Yu!

Before he could resist, Qin Yu’s second palm had already struck over!

Yan Jinyao raised his head to look at the palm that was slapping towards the ground. His face instantly turned ashen, and terror filled his entire heart!

“No, no! !”Yan Jinyao roared with all his might. At this moment, he realized that Qin Yu in front of him was not someone he could resist at all!

“Boom!”

This palm strike arrived as scheduled and caused the entire ground to collapse.

Under this palm strike, Yan Jinyao’s body had almost collapsed. His body was covered in blood and his white bones were exposed. Blood kept flowing out of his mouth and he looked extremely miserable.

He had tried many times to get up but he had failed. This palm strike was too powerful. If he had not formed his primordial spirit after becoming a martial saint, this palm strike would have taken his life!

Looking at Yan Jinyao’s miserable appearance, everyone could not help but suck in a cold breath.

Yan Jinyao, who was known as the number one in the world, had actually fallen to such a state. It could not help but make people sigh.

“It’s my turn...”in the dark, he teng, who was wrapped in a black robe, licked his lips.

However, at this moment, that hoarse voice sounded in his mind.

“You are no match for him... If you attack now, I’m afraid you will die here...”

Upon hearing this voice, he teng immediately stopped in his tracks.

“I have already stepped into the martial saint realm, how can I not kill him? Moreover, he has just experienced a great battle. Now is the best time to kill him!”He Teng was somewhat unwilling to accept this.

“Qin Yu’s body... is no weaker than a mighty figure... although he has just experienced a great battle, his internal QI is at its peak right now and is almost completely undamaged...”that hoarse voice said.

He Teng could not help but clench his fist. Because of his anger, the black energy all over his body was surging.

“Damn it...”he teng could not help but clench his teeth.

“Let’s go. If we don’t leave now, it will be too late...”

He Teng forcefully suppressed the anger in his heart. He did not stay any longer and turned to leave.

Not far away, Qin Yu strode towards Yan Jinyao. He raised his foot and stepped on Yan Jinyao’s body.

“I’ve said it before. If it weren’t for your relationship with Yan Ruoxue, I would have killed you long ago.”Qin Yu looked at Yan Jinyao coldly.

“As Ruoxue’s closest relative, you actually did such a thing to her. Yan Jinyao, your death is not worth it!”

Yan Jinyao opened his mouth to speak, but the moment he opened his mouth, blood gushed out non-stop.

Not far away, a rolls-royce was speeding over. The moment the car stopped, Yan Sihai was seen running out of the car.

“Qin Yu, Stop! Let Go of my son!”Yan Sihai shouted crazily.

As he shouted, he ran towards Qin Yu with an anxious look on his face. He looked a little pitiful.

Qin Yu looked at Yan Sihai coldly and sneered, “Your Son’s life is now in my hands. You still dare to shout at me?”

As he spoke, Qin Yu increased the strength of his feet. Yan Jinyao, who was already injured, immediately felt even more pain!

“No... No!”A trace of panic flashed across Yan Sihai’s face.

He said in a trembling voice, “Don’t Kill My Son! I beg you, don’t kill him...”

Looking at Yan Sihai’s begging manner, Qin Yu could not help but laugh out loud.

“You want me to let him go? Fine, kneel down and beg me!”Qin Yu said coldly.

Yan Sihai’s expression suddenly changed, and a trace of viciousness flashed in his eyes.

He had been born in the Yan family since he was young, and he had never knelt down to anyone before!

Now, asking him to kneel in front of so many people was worse than killing him!

“Qin Yu, as long as you let my son go, I will give you whatever you want!”Yan Sihai gritted his teeth and said.

Qin Yu sneered and said, “What can you give me? Money? Status? Do you think these are important to me?”

Yan Sihai opened his mouth, not knowing what to say for a moment.

To the Yan family, the most precious thing they could offer was money.

But money was not worth mentioning in Qin Yu’s eyes, so how could he exchange it for Yan Jinyao’s life?

“You don’t want to kneel? Fine.”Qin Yu did not say a word, and the strength of his feet increased again.

“PFFT!”

Blood suddenly spurted out of Yan Jinyao’s mouth, and his internal Qi decreased rapidly!

“No, no!”Yan Sihai roared crazily.

He glared at Qin Yu and said in horror, “I’ll kneel, I’ll kneel!”

Qin Yu put his hands behind his back and said indifferently, “Kneel and beg me, I might spare his life.”

Yan Sihai’s eyes were scarlet. Such humiliation made him shiver all over.

The people around him even took out their phones, as if they wanted to take a picture of Yan Sihai’s humiliation.

His knees slowly fell down. Accompanied by a “Bang”sound, Yan Sihai’s knees fell heavily to the ground.

Yan Sihai lowered his head and clenched his fists tightly. The expression on his face was almost ferocious.

Looking at Yan Sihai’s appearance, Qin Yu’s face couldn’t help but flash with a trace of coldness.

“Yan Sihai, you and I shouldn’t have been like this. Unfortunately, you are selfish and greedy,”Qin Yu said coldly.

That’s right. If Yan Sihai hadn’t made a move on Yan Ruoxue, how would he have ended up like this?

But now, it was useless to say anything.

“I’ve already knelt down. You can let my son go now, right?”Yan Sihai said through gritted teeth.

“Of course. I, Qin Yu, am a man of my word,”Qin Yu said indifferently.

He slowly moved his feet away. Yan Jinyao, who was lying on the ground, finally had a chance to catch his breath.

However, at this moment, Qin Yu suddenly pointed with his finger. A golden light instantly entered Yan Jinyao’s mind!

“Ah!”A burst of intense pain immediately came from his head! His primordial spirit seemed to have suffered a lightning strike!

This intense pain almost made him faint!

And after this intense pain, Yan Jinyao clearly felt that the true qi and spiritual power in his body were rapidly disappearing!

“You... you actually wasted my cultivation!”Yan Jinyao’s pores shrank, and his face turned ashen!

Qin Yu sneered and said, “I only promised to spare your life, but I didn’t say that I would spare you.”
