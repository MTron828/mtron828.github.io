2390 Taking the Lead

“I’m willing, Master!”

Without hesitation, Yan Ruoxue followed the highest etiquette of paying respect to a master and performed ten kneelings and ten kowtows.

“Ruoxue, the fact that you and Qin Yu can be together, we only contributed one percent of the effort. Even if we couldn’t bring you back yesterday, you two will definitely be together in the future. If it weren’t for the fact that we saw through your hearts, Lei Xin and I wouldn’t have paid such a huge price to help you two.”

Flower Granny Hua said in a deep voice.

“Many ordinary people fail to persevere in their lives, not to mention those who cultivate. We’ve seen how you’ve developed step by step from Earth until now, including how you can evolve the primordial rune and break through the Heaven-sealing Orb. This surprised Flower Granny and me. To be honest, the talent you’ve displayed has also triggered us to invest in you.”

Lei Xin continued.

“Of course, your strength is still far from enough. Although we have temporarily persuaded the two families to retreat, we can predict various large factions will still want to pursue the things on you. If you want you two to survive in this chaotic world, you must improve greatly.”

Lei Xin stood up abruptly and said to Qin Yu.

“Qin Yu, this battle against the nine great aristocratic families is a tremendous experience for you. Today, I will send you into the immortal grave again for the last time. This is your last chance to experience the core secret technique of Immortal Emperor Lei. You two must leave the Holy Region when you come out of seclusion. Of course, Ruoxue had to cultivate with Flower Granny. We’ll do our best to stall the nine great aristocratic families for some time.”

Lei Xin grabbed Qin Yu and waved his other hand.

A door slowly took shape, and the might of lightning instantly surged out from within.

Lei Xin threw Qin Yu inside while Flower Granny left with Yan Ruoxue.

“Stay strong. This is the last thing we can do for you.”

Lei Xin sighed. Flower Granny was actually holding on now.

Even if the Yan and the Si families kept their promise, aristocratic families did not rise out of thin air for other families. They had accumulated for thousands of years to become aristocratic families!

At this moment, a wave of smoke suddenly swept up into the sky.

This smoke was tens of millions of miles away, but it was still visible to the naked eye in the Thunder Courtyard. Even cultivators with sensitive divine senses could sense the slight tremors transmitted from the ground.

“That place seems to belong to the Yun family. What happened?”

Lei Xin was shocked.

…

Demonic Qi was soaring in the Yun family’s holy land.

The leading four divine beasts in human form pushed out their palms simultaneously.

The Azure Dragon, White Tiger, Black Tortoise, and Vermilion Bird’, the four symbols’ powers interweaved and entangled with each other. The brief combination suddenly released a black shock wave that instantly surged toward the Si family’s formation.

The divine beast of the four symbols guarded the four corners of the universe. It was rumored that once the power of the four symbols combined, it would be power to destroy the heavens.

At this moment, the Ni family’s formation emitted a dazzling light, but it was useless.

Under the world-destroying power, the formation was like an eggshell blocking the sea waves. It could not withstand it at all.

In an instant, at least 30% of the Ni family’s people died as the black destructive demonic qi surged.

Their bodies were withered as if all their vitality had been stripped away.

“Immortal Crane! When the golden age is completely released, all the cultivators of my Ni family will enter the land of your demon race, kill the demons, eat your demon race’s flesh, and drink your demon race’s blood. The Ni family will never live under the same sky as the demon race!”

The eyes of the head of the Ni family were bloodshot as he roared.

“Heh, isn’t the human race always doing these things? You can’t stand it when I repay you a little today.”

The Immortal Crane’s face turned into a mocking expression as it pointed its finger lightly.

The four divine beasts instantly transformed into their true bodies of a thousand meters tall. Their ferocious demonic qi even suppressed those with slightly lower cultivation to the point that they could not breathe.

The Vermilion Bird let out a cry, and her enormous body soared into the sky. After that, two massive flames brandished under her wings.

Flame Burning the Source!

In an instant, the sea of fire exploded. In the blink of an eye, no one else survived except a dozen powerful elders of the Ni family.

This was the genuine power of tribulation. The golden age of the demon race had long descended. This kind of attack was simply unstoppable.

Even dozens of elders were indeed saved by the Holy Lord of the Ni Family by activating the celestial artifact, the Ni Temple of Heaven.

“Let’s go!”

The Holy Lord of the Ni family shouted with bloodshot eyes.

The Ni Temple of Heaven slammed into the back, and a large number of demons were instantly smashed into meat paste.

The celestial artifact brought a dozen elders transforming into a rainbow and left.

A figure looked at the Ni Temple of Heaven, soared into the sky like a giant eagle, and arrived at the temple in the blink of an eye. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

He did not use any spells but just threw a punch at the Ni Temple of Heaven.

No internal qi could be sensed on that fist.

“You’re courting death! Get lost!”

“Boom!”

A Primordial Chaos internal qi suddenly erupted. Countless demons in the surroundings were affected by the massive shock and lost their vitality one after another, and their internal organs were shattered by the shock of this collision.

However, the celestial artifact, the Ni Temple of Heaven, could not withstand this terrifying punch.

The celestial artifact flew backward, and the people it carried fell onto the ground.

Two elders even died directly, turning into a pile of meat paste.

“Xiao Sheng! You, a human, actually cultivated the demon race’s Meridian Circulation Technique and joined the demon race. You even helped the demon race kill humans. Do you still have any conscience as a human?!”

The Hoy Lord of the Ni family recognized Xiao Sheng and let out a hoarse roar.

His angry face could not help but tremble.

“So what? In my opinion, the nine great aristocratic families must be killed, leaving no one alive.”

Xiao Sheng stared at the two indifferently and punched again.

The Holy Lord of the Ni family activated his celestial artifact and punched out again.

Ni Qian also activated a technique, the Ethereal Mirage, and tens of thousands of palm shadows struck Xiao Sheng fiercely.

With a single punch, the Ni Temple of Heaven was destroyed again.

Xiao Sheng retracted his fist and stared at Ni Qian.

He casually punched at one of the tens of thousands of palm shadows.

Amid tens of thousands of palm shadows, a punch directly hit Ni Qian’s arm.

It was accurate, without the slightest error. In an instant, the palm shadow disappeared.

In an instant, a crisp sound of bones cracking sounded. One of Ni Qian’s arms was directly smashed into meat paste.

“What a terrifying fellow! Such a human was actually forced to join our demon race. It’s interesting!”

Immortal Crane looked at Xiao Sheng and smiled.

Suddenly, seven or eight light beams smashed down from the Ni family. The internal qi was powerful and vigorous and had a surge of ancient internal qi of the Path of Heaven.

“The Supreme Elder of the Ni family has returned from purgatory. It’s real fast.”

That Black Tortoise turned into an old man and frowned behind Immortal Crane.

“It doesn’t matter. Even if all of them descend, we have nothing to fear. The Golden Path of Heaven of the human race has not been fully released yet.”

Vermilion Bird licked its red lips as if it wanted to eat this group of people.
