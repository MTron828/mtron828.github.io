Chapter 959: Chapter 959, fighting against eight martial saints!

During this period of time, a few more martial saints had walked out from the secret realm.

Including the original martial saints, there were already nine martial saints!

With nine martial saints attacking, even if Xu Huaigu had great abilities, he would not be able to resist!

The group of people brought the spiritual artifacts from the secret realm and rushed towards the nine Pinnacles Mountain!

The nine Pinnacles Mountain was peaceful.

Qin Yu was still trying to figure out his own dao techniques.

This was the key to becoming a martial saint, and the only way to become one.

At this moment, Qin Yu’s slightly closed eyes suddenly opened.

“Eh?”Qin Yu frowned slightly.

For some reason, his heart suddenly jumped. An extremely uneasy feeling rippled in his heart.

At this moment, Qin Yu suddenly felt traces of internal Qi approaching the nine pinnacles mountain!

Not only Qin Yu, but many people also felt this internal Qi!

“Someone is coming,”Yao Meng said in a low voice.

“I also felt it.”Kong Yun’s face instantly turned cold.

“They are finally going to make a move.”Chang Mang took a deep breath, full of fighting spirit.

Meanwhile, Xu Huaigu, who was plowing the ground, also put down the hoe in his hand.

He sighed slightly and looked into the distance as he muttered in a low voice, “What should come will come.”

Qin Yu rushed out of the room with large strides. He swept his gaze across the crowd and shouted, “All of you, quickly hide!”

“Hide? Where are you hiding? Since they are here, then let’s fight it out with them!”Chang Mang shouted loudly.

However, Qin Yu said with a cold face, “The one who decides the outcome is the martial saint. All of you are powerless before the martial saint.”

“Qin Yu is right.”

At this moment, Xu Huaigu also slowly walked over.

“Everyone, hide in the house immediately,”Xu Huaigu said quietly.

Qin Yu hurriedly shouted, “Hurry and hide!”

Everyone gritted their teeth. Although they were unwilling, they still walked into the house.

“You should go too.”At this moment, Xu Huaigu looked at Qin Yu.

Qin Yu hurriedly shook his head and said, “Senior, if I can stop a martial saint, at least I can share the pressure with you.”

“No need. One more and one less won’t change anything.”Xu Huaigu shook his head.

Qin Yu opened his mouth and wanted to say something, but he was interrupted by Xu Huaigu’s wave of his hand.

“This is my dao technique and the reason for my existence. Go.”Xu Huaigu said quietly.

Qin Yu was stunned. He gritted his teeth and cupped his hands, “Senior, please take care of yourself.”

Then, Qin Yu quickly hid in the room. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Everyone was hiding in this room, but their eyes were looking out the window.

“Senior Xu Huaigu will be fine, right?”Zhuang Teng said with a frown.

Qin Yu did not say anything. Although he did not want to admit it, it would not be easy to fight against so many martial saints.

“I hope everything is fine...”Qin Yu sighed in a low voice.

At the foot of the nine pinnacles mountain.

Gu Xinghe led the nine martial saints and walked up the mountain.

Every step they took seemed to land on the hearts of everyone. It was extremely heavy.

“Young master Gu.”At this moment, Zhai Xing suddenly opened his mouth as if he wanted to say something.

However, Gu Xinghe said coldly, “Uncle Zhai Xing, if you still acknowledge my father, don’t Say Anything.”

Seeing this, Zhai Xing could only sigh slightly and say nothing.

Very soon, Gu Xinghe appeared on the top of the mountain.

His gaze swept across the entire mountain, and finally landed on Xu Huaigu.

Xu Huaigu’s eyes were slightly closed, and his expression was indifferent. He still looked like an immortal.

Gu Xinghe sneered and walked straight to Xu Huaigu, saying, “Xu Huaigu, they robbed the JINGDU martial arts association. This is a capital crime. You should understand, right?”

Xu Huaigu closed his eyes slightly and did not speak.

Gu Xinghe continued, “If you’re sensible, hand them over.”

Xu Huaigu remained silent.

Gu Xinghe snorted lightly, “You should know what crime it is to shield a criminal, right?”

Hearing this, Xu Huaigu finally spoke.

He looked at GU xinghe and said, “Does the JINGDU martial arts association still have the right to convict people?”

Gu Xinghe narrowed his eyes and sneered, “So, you’re not going to hand him over?”

“There are some things that you don’t need to know.”Xu Huaigu shook his head.

“Okay!”Gu Xinghe seemed very satisfied with this answer.

He leaned against Xu Huaigu’s ear and whispered, “I was really afraid that you would hand him over because then I would have no reason to kill you...”

After he had said this, Gu Xinghe took a few steps back.

He looked at Xu Huaigu coldly and said, “Xu Huaigu harbors criminals and is as guilty as the criminals! Everyone, listen up and bring him back!”

The Nine Martial Saints took a step forward in unison!

Zeng Ji, who had suffered a loss the last time, seemed to want to regain his face. He took the lead and walked towards Xu Huaigu.

“How dare you, who have never even entered the mystic realm, go against us? I really don’t know where you get your confidence from!”

As Zeng ji shouted angrily, he suddenly clenched his fist and smashed it toward Xu Huaigu’s face!

Xu Huaigu’s expression did not change. He waved his sleeve, and a force that was both firm and gentle, as well as evil, immediately rushed toward him!

The force on Zeng Ji’s fist was instantly dissolved by the GENTLE FORCE! And that firm and fierce force slammed onto Zeng Ji’s chest!

“Deng Deng Deng!”

Zeng Ji immediately took a few steps back, and a mouthful of blood gushed out!

Several ribs on his chest had been broken, and large amounts of blood flowed out.

“Damn it!”Zeng Ji was instantly enraged, and his internal Qi surged!

“Trash.”However, at this time, Gu Xinghe shot him a cold glance, and his eyes were filled with ridicule.

“We are not here to play with you.”

Wan Gu Qiong clapped his hands and said with a smile, “Young master Gu is right. I suggest that we all attack together and end this battle as soon as possible. We must kill this Xu Huaigu as soon as possible.”

Gu Xinghe looked at Wan Gu Qiong and nodded slightly, “I agree. Everyone, attack together!”

As soon as he gave the order, eight martial saints walked towards Xu Huaigu at the same time. Only Zhai Xing stood on Gu Xinghe’s side and did not move at all.

Xu Huaigu remained calm when facing these eight martial saints.

It was as if he had already anticipated his ending and had already disregarded his life and death.

In the room, Qin Yu and the others had extremely ugly expressions on their faces!

Even if Xu Huaigu was extremely capable, how could he deal with the eight martial saints!
