Chapter 1660: Chapter 1,660, unrivalled power! 1 Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

This radiance was extremely holy, but within it was a sharp killing intent!

The bracelet floated into the air on its own!

And this bracelet was the bracelet that Xiao Yu had given to Qin Yu!

“HM?”

Qin Yu was stunned and stood rooted to the ground.

He didn’t activate this bracelet at all, and didn’t even know how to use it!

“What’s going on?”Qin Yu was dumbstruck. The light emitted from the bracelet enveloped Qin Yu’s body, sweeping away the oppressive feeling from his body!

Then, the bracelet floated in the air and formed a confrontation with that mysterious person!

“I understand,”Qin Yu muttered in a low voice.

Under the powerful internal Qi of the immortal slaying sect, the bracelet was automatically resurrected. Now, it was forming a confrontation with that person!

The two beams of light collided at this moment, creating an extremely powerful airwave.

A casual airwave could kill Qin Yu hundreds or thousands of times!

He hurriedly retreated to the side, afraid of being affected.

The two beams of light were in a stalemate in the air. Qin Yu couldn’t help but feel a little nervous.

This bracelet was given by Xiao Yu, so its origin was naturally extraordinary. It was most likely related to the masked woman from back then.

However, it was only a bracelet after all. No one knew how much power it could unleash if it wasn’t her!

On the other hand, it was the revival of a real person. It was incomparably powerful!

Even if it was just a strand of internal Qi, it was definitely not to be underestimated!

The radiance continued to resist. The mysterious person’s expression was extremely cold as he activated his powerful internal Qi with both of his hands.

The bracelet was emitting a dazzling and holy light. This light covered the land and illuminated the darkness of this domain.

In the outside world.

They were unable to observe what was happening in this domain. Even an expert like Xiao Sheng was unable to do so.

Everyone’s hearts were anxious. This was because no one knew what was going to happen in this domain.

“This time, I’m afraid the odds are stacked against us,”Xiao Sheng said coldly.

He knew too well the strength of that mysterious person. Even a single glance from such an existence was enough to destroy an entire world! Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Once he made his move, no one would be able to defeat him!

“Why didn’t you make your move earlier? If you had killed that elementalist earlier, how could such a thing have happened!”The people beside him flew into a rage. Everyone was furious!

Qin Yu had fought until the very end for the South region. If he died in battle, no one would be able to accept it!

Xiao Sheng remained silent. His eyes were staring straight at the domain. No one knew what he was thinking.

Time passed by. Just as everyone was about to give up, an extremely intense explosion sounded from within the domain!

Following that, the domain directly exploded. Powerful air waves gushed out like flames!

Xiao Sheng’s expression changed slightly. He hurriedly cast a spell to protect everyone.

However, this air wave was too powerful. It was almost impossible to resist it with a spell!

Buzz

At this moment, a black hole-like radiance appeared in front of Xiao Sheng!

This radiance forcefully dragged the air wave into the Void!

Rashomon!

It was Xiao Sheng’s Rashomon. His comprehension of space could be said to have reached the peak of perfection!

Countless airwaves were swallowed into the void by the Rashomon, and the domain also completely exploded.

Everyone nervously looked in the direction of the domain. They didn’t know whether Qin Yu was dead or alive.

Even Xiao Sheng’s gaze couldn’t help but fall in that direction.

Finally, a figure walked out from within.

His thin figure made people’s hearts ache, but the undefeatable battle intent on his body made people feel admiration!

“It’s... It’s Qin Yu! He’s still alive!”

No one knew who was the first to cry out! After that, countless people shouted Qin Yu’s name!

The voices in the area were like thunder, rumbling. At this moment, it was as if Qin Yu was their true God!

A smile appeared on Xiao Sheng’s face. There was a hint of doubt in his smile, as if he was wondering how Qin Yu survived.

Qin Yu walked out of the domain with a bracelet in his hand.

He looked down at the bracelet and said in a low voice, “It’s all thanks to Xiao Yu. Otherwise, I’m afraid... I’m doomed.”

He could not help but recall the scene that had just happened.

The bracelet exploded with a blazing radiance and directly pierced through the mysterious person from the immortal slaying sect.

However, the elementalists still had a backup plan. When the mysterious person died, he exploded with an extremely powerful internal Qi. This internal Qi was enough to destroy everyone!

Just as Qin Yu was sighing with emotion, everyone ran up to him.

They surrounded Qin Yu and were extremely excited. They regarded Qin Yu as the new hero of the southern region.

However, Qin Yu, who had just experienced a huge battle, was a little tired. Standing in the middle of the crowd, he looked extremely tired.

“Alright, Qin Yu is already very tired. Let him rest well!”At this moment, Wen Wanye pushed the crowd aside and came to Qin Yu’s side.

Qin Yu bowed slightly to the crowd and then looked at Wen wanye.

“Master, let’s go back to Mount Dayue first,”said Qin Yu.

Wen wanye grunted in gratitude. He carried Qin Yu on his back and turned around to leave.

After this battle, Qin Yu’s name was completely well-known in the South Province.

Everyone knew that Qin Yu’s growth could no longer be restrained. Whoever dared to provoke him again would probably die.

Mount Dayue.

Qin Yu lay on the bed, holding a pill in his hand.

This pill was the return to void pill that Jing Bai had given Qin Yu.

“I actually didn’t use it,”Qin Yu thought to himself.

He kept the pill and planned to find an opportunity to return it to Jing Bai.

Then, Qin Yu lay on the bed and fell asleep.

...

Yong Ji, Sima Bei, and he teng fled back to the northern lands in a sorry state.

Their faces were filled with an indescribable solemnity, and the atmosphere was extremely strange.

The three of them did not say anything, but they were all thinking the same thing.

The sense of danger for the future filled their hearts.

“Qin Yu... has actually grown to such an extent.”After a long while, Yong Ji spoke first.

He clenched his fists and said through gritted teeth, “If I had known earlier, I would have killed him!”

Sima bei glanced at him and said coldly, “It’s useless to say anything now. No one would have thought that someone from the southern region would actually stand up again, and it’s even a junior.”

As they spoke, the Elementalist’s voice appeared in their minds.

The three of them did not dare to say anything and hurriedly rushed in the direction of the elementalist.

In the Snow Mountain at the center of the Northern Region.

The Elementalist’s voice came from the snowy mountain.

“Is Qin Yu Dead?”The elementalist asked coldly.

The three people at the scene looked at each other. None of them dared to speak.

“What? Are you all deaf? !”The elementalist shouted loudly, causing the entire northern lands to tremble!

Sima bei braced himself and said, “Master, Qin Yu... Qin Yu is not dead. He won...”
