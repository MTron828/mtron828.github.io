Chapter 994: Chapter 994, natural elements

A hint of surprise flashed across Qin Yu’s face.

What was going on?

Where did the crackling sound come from when he clenched his fist?

This power was extremely weak and didn’t play much of a role. It only brought about a small improvement.

However, this power that didn’t belong to his own body still surprised Qin Yu.

“Thunder Element,”iron egg explained in his mind. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“You really got a blessing in disguise.”

Qin Yu exclaimed, “Thunder element? What do you mean?”

Iron egg said, “It’s a kind of natural energy between heaven and earth. Usually, people who control this kind of power are born with it.”

“For example, some people are born with the ability to control the wind and use it to fight.”

“There are also people who can control water. As long as they are on the water, their strength will increase dramatically.”

Qin Yu said in surprise, “That means I can control lightning now?”

“What the F * ck do you want to Eat?”Iron Egg rolled his eyes.

“You just happened to get the power of the Lightning element. It’s already good enough that you can borrow the power of lightning. Do you still want to control it?”

Qin Yu made an “Oh”sound. He tried to borrow the power in his body, but he found that he couldn’t use it at all.

Because this power was too weak. The faint power couldn’t do anything. It could even be ignored.

But no matter what, it was true that Qin Yu’s body had become stronger.

“I remember now. So the palace master of the Cold Palace had ice and snow elements.”Qin Yu patted his head!

No wonder the cold palace was set up in such a harsh environment.

“The first is honey, the second is arsenic.”Qin Yu muttered in a low voice.

“There seems to be a lei family in the northwest. It is said that their family can borrow the power of lightning.”At this moment, Qin Yu suddenly thought of something.

This lei family had once attacked Qin Yu. At that time, Qin Yu had planned to massacre their family.

At that time, Qin Yu did not know what elements they had. He only knew that they could borrow the power of lightning.

“If I have time, I might be able to make a trip to the Lei family.”Qin Yu thought to himself.

Since he had mastered this element, he must be able to improve it.

The so-called control must be something that could only be achieved when he had mastered this element to the extreme.

Qin Yu did not continue to think about it. Instead, he rushed towards the southern mountain village.

The Southern Mountain Village.

These few days, the entire village was shrouded in an atmosphere of panic.

Zeng Ji and the others were martial saints. Naturally, their strength was not something the southern mountain village could compare to.

“Little Qin, do you not know where Qin Yu is...”an old man from the village asked in a trembling voice.

Yu Qin bit her lips and did not say a word.

The old man continued to say, “Little Qin, I am not asking you to betray Qin Yu. It’s just that... I can not watch all the elderly, children, women, and children in the village die for no reason.”

Tears welled up in Yu Qin’s eyes as she whispered, “Granny Yuan, I really don’t know where he is. He has never contacted me before...”

The old man called Granny Yuan sighed. Just as she was about to speak, Granny Yuan’s head suddenly exploded!

Blood splattered on Yu Qin’s Fair and tender face, and her expression instantly froze.

“You talk too much.”Zeng Ji walked forward and said indifferently.

He lowered his head and looked at Yu Qin. He grinned and said, “If you don’t want more people to die, then think of a way to get Qin Yu to appear. Do you understand?”

Yu Qin stared at Zeng Ji with eyes that were about to spit fire!

In the next second, Yu Qin waved her tender arms and struck Zeng Ji’s body.

Zeng Ji was a martial saint, so how could he be hurt by an ordinary girl?

With just a glance, Zeng Ji sent Yu Qin flying a few meters away!

“You don’t know life from death.”Zeng ji patted the dust off his body.

“If I didn’t have any use for you, I would have killed you long ago!”

Yu Qin struggled to get up, but she couldn’t.

She looked at Granny Yuan’s corpse, and tears kept flowing out.

Yu Qin couldn’t help but cry in despair.

At this moment, she suddenly realized that sometimes, medical skills alone couldn’t save people.

The time left for Zeng Ji to decide was getting shorter and shorter.

“How much longer?”Zeng ji glanced at the person next to him.

“Half an hour,”the person next to him said.

Zeng Ji glanced at Yu Qin and snorted, “I thought she had some relationship with Qin Yu, but now it seems that I’m overthinking.”

The person next to him laughed and said, “Mr. Zeng, Qin Yu only has Yan Ruoxue in his heart. This is the common understanding of the world. Why would he take a fancy to her?”

Zeng ji snorted and said, “Loving one person doesn’t mean loving only one person. which man doesn’t cheat?”

After saying that, Zeng Ji took Yu Qin and turned around to leave.

He dragged Yu Qin and flew into the air.

Then, Zeng ji said coldly, “I said that if Qin Yu doesn’t show up in three days, he will slaughter the whole village!”

“Now that the time is up and he still hasn’t shown up, I can only kill him!”

Then, Zeng Ji looked at Yu Qin in his hand and said indifferently, “Since you have offended me, I will start with you.”

After saying that, Zeng Ji grabbed Yu Qin and threw her to the ground like a Chick!

Yu Qin’s body was falling rapidly. She closed her eyes in despair, waiting for death to come.

But at that moment, Yu Qin felt a trace of warmth, as if she was thrown into a warm embrace.

When she opened her eyes, she saw that she was really lying in an embrace!

When she looked up, she saw the face that she had been longing for!

Qin Yu hugged Yu Qin and gently placed her on the ground.

Yu Qin’s face was full of surprise and joy. She opened her mouth, not knowing what to say for a moment.

Qin Yu frowned and said, “I remember that I gave you a keepsake, right? Why didn’t you use it?”

Yu Qin shook her head and did not say a word.

Qin Yu did not ask any further. Instead, he looked at Zeng Ji coldly.

Zeng Ji was also staring at his pockets. Then, he laughed loudly and said, “I really thought that you were a pure and innocent person! hahaha! Don’t you love Yan Ruoxue deeply? Why would you risk your life for such a woman?”

Qin Yu looked at Zeng ji coldly and said, “I came to save her only because she saved me. I didn’t have any feelings.”

When Yu Qin heard this, a hint of disappointment flashed in her eyes.
