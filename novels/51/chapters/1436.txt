Chapter 1437: Chapter 1,437, spiritual energy deficit 1 

As expected, everything was as the deputy sect master had said.

After his injuries had slightly recovered, Di zun came to plead with the Great Elder.

The great elder pretended not to agree. Under Di Zun’s pleas, he “Reluctantly”agreed to let the remaining people go and claimed that it was out of respect for Di Zun.

...

Divine capital city.

Qin Yu had been standing on the city wall for the past few days, looking at the vast expanse of desert.

This desert stretched for hundreds of stars and was nowhere to be seen.

Just this piece of desert was almost the size of an earth.

Standing here, it was as if he was cut off from the world and could not know anything.

A few days later.

Qin Yu, who was standing on the city wall, finally saw Zhuo Jing.

He was standing on a huge godly eagle with a long sword in his arms.

The godly eagle was extremely huge. Its arms were nearly a hundred meters long, and it looked very imposing.

“It’s finally here.”Qin Yu couldn’t help but sigh in relief when he saw Zhuo Jing rushing over.

He jumped down from the city wall and stood at the gate of the city wall, waiting for Zhuo Jing to arrive quietly.

The huge godly eagle slowly stopped in front of Qin Yu. The powerful air pressure stirred up waves of dust.

Zhuo Jing jumped down from the Godly Eagle and put the godly eagle into his spatial artifact.

“It’s really hard to find a place like this,”Zhuo Jing said helplessly.

Qin Yu praised, “Your godly eagle is really handsome.”

“Haha, if you like it, I’ll give it to you.”Zhuo Jing joked.

Qin Yu waved his hand and said, “Let’s go. Please come in.”

At this time, Zhuo Jing looked at Qin Yu in surprise and said, “Brother Qin, you... you have recovered your spiritual power?”

Qin Yu did not hide anything and nodded, “Yes, a few days ago in Qingyan Forest, I got the life force by luck.”

Zhuo Jing gave Qin Yu a thumbs up and said, “Brother Qin, you are indeed not simple.”

“There is nothing not simple. I was just lucky,”Qin Yu said with a bitter smile.

Zhuo Jing did not say much, but a meaningful smile appeared on his face.

This smile was extremely strange, and Qin Yu did not understand it for a moment.

After welcoming Zhuo Jing into the tea room, Qin Yu poured zhuo jing some water and said, “Brother Zhuo, what good news did you get this time?”

Zhuo Jing said with a faint smile, “I wouldn’t dare to disturb you without good news.”

He picked up the teacup and said indifferently, “I heard the news about the life qi, but I think Brother Qin doesn’t need it now.”

“No.”Qin Yu hurriedly shook his head and said in a deep voice, “My body is still very strange. I do have spiritual power in my body, but... it’s very little.”

Qin Yu told Zhuo Jing about his situation.

After Zhuo Jing heard it, he could not help but burst out laughing.

“What’s Wrong?”Qin Yu asked suspiciously.

Zhuo Jing forced himself to smile and said, “Brother Qin, I have been in the divine capital for such a short time, but I already feel that the spiritual energy in my body has been suppressed. Do you know why? It is because there is no spiritual energy in the surroundings.”

“Moreover, you have lost your spiritual power for too long. Your body can be said to be in an extremely empty state, so your spiritual power is naturally insufficient.” F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

This was the same as Qin Yu’s guess, but after listening to Zhuo Jing’s explanation, Qin Yu also had a sense of confidence.

“Phew, then I’m relieved,”Qin Yu said with a smile.

“Try to sense your Dantian. The spiritual energy in your body is probably extremely dry long ago,”Zhuo Jing said while shaking his head.

This was the truth. Qin Yu had also noticed this problem.

“It seems that I have to recuperate for a few days as soon as possible,”Qin Yu said.

“A few days?”Zhuo Jing shook his head, “Even if I come to the divine capital once, I will need to recuperate for a few days when I go back, let alone in your condition. Based on my speculation, you will need at least a month to recover to your normal condition, and this is under the premise of replenishing your body with elixirs.”

“So Long...”Qin Yu took a sip of tea, and a hint of solemnity appeared on his face.

Zhuo jing smiled and said, “If brother Qin needs medicinal pills, you can tell me. I can provide them for you temporarily.”

Upon hearing this, Qin Yu immediately cupped his hands and said, “Thank you very much, Brother Zhuo. There is no need for medicinal pills. Just give me the medicinal ingredients.”

With that said, Qin Yu flipped his palm, and the long-lost spiritual fire immediately jumped onto Qin Yu’s palm.

Seeing the purple spirit fire burning on Qin Yu’s palm, Zhuo Jing couldn’t help but widen his eyes.

“Brother Qin, you are also an alchemist?”Zhuo Jing asked with a face full of shock.

Qin Yu acknowledged and said, “I was lucky to have learned it.”

“Lucky? This is a purple spirit fire.”Zhuo Jing’s tone carried some shock.

Qin Yu smiled and didn’t say anything. It was very clear that purple spirit fires weren’t common even in the holy region.

The spiritual fire in his palm soon disappeared. Without the support of spiritual energy, the spiritual fire wouldn’t last long.

Qin Yu looked at Zhuo Jing and said, “By the way, where is the life energy you mentioned before?”

Zhuo jing smiled and said, “In the exchange union, it is said that the life energy has appeared before. Because of you, the life energy is very popular now.”

Qin Yu touched her chin and said in a low voice, “The trade union...”

This was the second time Qin Yu had heard this title. It was said that many treasures would appear there.
