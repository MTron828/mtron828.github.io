Chapter 424: Dantian Damaged Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

This move was undoubtedly a desperate one!

At such a close distance, Qin Yu could not dodge. He could only allow the dagger-like killing intent to head straight for his dantian!

“Bang!”

Qin Yu’s fist pierced through Li Zinan’s chest.

The spell that Li Zinan used also ruthlessly pierced into Qin Yu’s dantian!

“You...” Li Zinan lowered his head and looked at the bloody hole in his chest. His face was full of despair.

Qin Yu looked at Li Zinan coldly and said, “It’s already impressive that you managed to hurt me.”

Li Zinan staggered and fell into the water.

He climbed out of the river and said coldly, “Qin Yu, it’s a pity that you couldn’t kill me in one strike.”

Qin Yu looked at Li Zinan coldly and said, “So?”

“So... I can use this opportunity to escape.” Li Zinan sneered.

“You think you can escape?” Qin Yu raised his eyebrows.

Li Zinan pointed at Qin Yu’s dantian and said, “Feel the inner strength in your body.”

Qin Yu frowned slightly. He tried to feel the spiritual power in his dantian, and his expression suddenly changed.

“You... actually injured my dantian?” Qin Yu stared at Li Zinan angrily.

Li Zinan laughed and said, “You actually exposed your dantian, but you didn’t kill me! Qin Yu, you have become a cripple!”

“Even if your dantian doesn’t shatter, your foundation will be damaged!”

“I, Li Zinan, seriously injured a genius. My life hasn’t been in vain even if I die!”

Hearing these words, Yao Qing, who was beside him, immediately flew into a rage.

“Li Zinan, I’m going to kill you!” Yao Qing’s entire body was surging with energy, and he had the intention to make a move.

However, how could Yao Qing be a match for Li Zinan?

Moreover, at this moment, Li Zinan was already heavily injured, and he no longer had the will to continue fighting.

“Qin Yu, I’ll wait and see what you’ll do in the future,” Li Zinan said coldly.

“At the same time, I also want to thank you. I believe that the Yan family and the Han family will thank me for this.”

After saying this, Li Zinan used the formation to escape!

“Don’t even think about leaving!” Yao Qing tried to chase after him, but was stopped by Qin Yu.

“Stop chasing,” Qin Yu said coldly.

Yao Qing gritted his teeth and said, “Are we just going to let him go?”

Qin Yu opened his mouth and was about to speak when he suddenly spat out a mouthful of blood!

He rubbed his dantian and said in a deep voice, “This person’s methods are really shocking.”

All of this was witnessed by Jing Lu, who was in the dark.

He narrowed his eyes and said in a low voice, “Qin Yu, you would have expected that you would also have this day. Your dantian has been damaged. Your good days are coming to an end.”

Then, Jing Lu quietly disappeared by the Riverside.

The entire riverside was only left with corpses, and Yao Qing and Qin Yu. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Yao Qing even muttered, “It’s over. This is troublesome. You have enemies on all sides. If your dantian is damaged, they will definitely take revenge. It’s over...”

Qin Yu remained silent. He closed his eyes slightly and adjusted his internal qi.

“Mr. Qin, why don’t we go to the Divine Alchemist Pavilion? I believe the Pavilion Master will definitely have a way!” Yao Qing said as he grabbed Qin Yu’s arm.

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “There’s no need for that. Let’s go back first.”

As he spoke, a barely noticeable smile flashed across the corner of Qin Yu’s mouth.

...

This battle was unprecedented.

Victory in a one against ten battle was rare in history.

However, Qin Yu had done it twice, and both times, he had succeeded.

The peak of the Inner Strength Grandmaster realm was already a rare achievement, and more than twenty of them had died in Qin Yu’s hands!

Such a battle record would definitely be recorded in history!

Qin Yu and Yao Qing returned to the hotel.

Yao Qing was filled with anxiety, and he kept rubbing his hair.

Qin Yu, on the other hand, sat cross-legged quietly, as if he was adjusting his bodily condition. From time to time, he would spit out a mouthful of blood.

“Mr. Qin, why aren’t you anxious at all?” Yao Qing said angrily.

Qin Yu glanced at him and said indifferently, “Is it useful to be anxious?”

“Mr. Qin, have you thought of a way?” Yao Qing’s eyes lit up.

However, Qin Yu shook his head and said, “No.”

“Then... then why don’t we run away? We should quickly flee abroad and never come back!” Yao Qing said.

Qin Yu said coldly, “I won’t leave. We will set off tomorrow and return to Chuzhou.”

Yao Qing wanted to say something, but was interrupted by Qin Yu with a wave of his hand.

In just one night, Qin Yu’s reputation as the grim reaper had spread throughout the entire Martial Arts Forum!

Some people even posted one clip after another. These clips were all taken through surveillance cameras.

Although the quality of the video wasn’t clear enough, and the color wasn’t bright enough, everyone could still see Qin Yu’s figure.

“One person killed more than ten peak-stage Inner Strength Grandmasters, including someone like Elder Zhuo. This is really... unprecedented!”

“From the looks of it, no one seems to be able to restrict Qin Yu’s development.”

“It’s fortunate that I didn’t get greedy. Otherwise, I would have become a corpse as well.”

Qin Yu’s battle achievements had already caused everyone to feel discouraged.

Not to mention that Qin Yu had the Meridian Circulation Technique, even if he had an ancient divine artifact, they would still have to consider it carefully.

The next day, Qin Yu returned to Chuzhou. These few days, he sat cross-legged at home and did nothing, as if he was waiting for something.

...

Jingdu, Yan family.

A man with a bandage on his chest came to visit the Yan family’s courtyard.

“Master, there’s someone called Li Zinan outside who wants to see you,” the butler said as he walked through the door.

“Li Zinan?” Yan Sihai frowned slightly.

How come he had never heard of this name before?

“He said he has important news to tell you about Qin Yu,” the butler continued.

At the mention of “Qin Yu,” Yan Sihai’s expression turned cold.

During this period of time, news about Qin Yu kept reaching his ears, and every piece of news spreading was about how powerful Qin Yu was.

Qin Yu was no longer so easy to deal with.

“Let him in.” Yan Sihai waved his hand.

Not long after, Li Zinan walked in.

The moment he saw Yan Sihai, he bowed and said, “Greetings, Mr. Yan.”

Yan Sihai glanced at him and said, “What’s the matter?”

Li Zinan said indifferently, “I wonder if Mr. Yan has heard that Qin Yu killed more than ten Inner Strength Grandmasters by the Yunchuan River?”

A flash of anger appeared on Yan Sihai’s expression.

He narrowed his eyes and said, “You came to me just to tell me this?”

A powerful pressure pressed down. Yan Sihai’s imposing aura made Li Zinan feel a trace of unease.
