2001 Tai Chi Diagram and Yin Yang Fish

A surge of internal qi instantly assailed him, and Qin Yu subconsciously stepped back.

“What’s going on?” Qin Yu frowned.

When he moved his hand away, the glow of the skeleton instantly disappeared.

Qin Yu looked at Jue Wu, signaling her to try touching it also.

Jue Wu walked forward and placed her small hand on it. However, there was no reaction from the skeleton.

“Strange.” Qin Yu was dumbfounded.

“Could it be that this skeleton is somehow related to me?”

Jue Wu stared at Qin Yu with her big eyes and said, “Could it be that he has the same physique as you?”

“Same physique?” These words reminded Qin Yu. He hurriedly walked toward the skeleton and tried to use his strength to grab the arm.

“Crack!”

Unfortunately, under Qin Yu’s strength, this skeleton directly shattered.

“It doesn’t seem like it.” Qin Yu shook his head.

He couldn’t sense any internal qi fluctuations from this skeleton. It probably had been there many years.

Now that Qin Yu had easily crushed it, it was evident that this skeleton was not only not a chaotic body, but its cultivation base was also not strong. Otherwise, this skeleton would be tremendously tough.

Qin Yu picked up the bone from the ground. After it broke, it lost its strange glow.

Qin Yu did not know the origin of this skeleton, but he had a feeling in his heart that this skeleton was not simple. It probably hid some secret.

Therefore, after much thought, Qin Yu kept the remaining dried bones in the Spatial Magic Artifact.

“Let’s not bother about this bone for now. Let’s see if there’s anything to eat,” Jue Wu muttered.

The two searched all over the room but found nothing.

Helplessly, they could only walk out and go to the forest.

Qin Yu went to the river to catch a few fish, while Jue Wu went to the forest to hunt a few wild beasts.

As the night deepened, Qin Yu and Jue Wu set up a fire. After a while, the fragrance of meat assailed their noses.

Jue Wu tore off a huge beast’s leg and wolfed it down.

Qin Yu was not idle either. Although he could not eat anything after fasting, he still craved delicious food.

Looking at the two wolfing down their food, the third princess, being tied up not far away, could not help but swallow her saliva.

She looked at the meat in Qin Yu’s hand eagerly and almost began drooling.

Qin Yu glanced at her, then tore off a piece of meat and threw it to the third princess.

However, the third princess’s body was tied up, and she could not eat at all.

Seeing this, Qin Yu stood up and walked toward the third princess.

Jue Wu said unhappily, “Why do you care about her? Just let her starve. She won’t starve to death anyway.”

Qin Yu ignored Jue Wu. He loosened the rope on the third princess and said, “I’ll tie you up after you finish eating. During this period, don’t think about running away, understand?”

The third princess quickly nodded. Then she picked up the meat on the ground and wolfed it down.

The third princess had a big appetite, almost on par with Jue Wu.

The two finished all the food in a moment. Not only that, but they also did not seem to have eaten enough.

“Is there anything else to eat?” The third princess looked at Qin Yu eagerly.

“Nothing! I’m not even full!” Jue Wu said fiercely.

The third princess seemed to be very afraid of Jue Wu. She subconsciously stepped back and didn’t even dare to look at Jue Wu.

Qin Yu was silent for a while, then said, “You stay here and look after her. I’ll go find something to eat.”

“Why don’t you just let her be?” Jue Wu said somewhat angrily. “Why do you care about her?”

Qin Yu smiled and said, “Aren’t you still not full either? Okay, I’ll be right back.”

Following that, Qin Yu walked toward the forest.

It was a tremendously huge mountain forest, but there were not as many wild beasts as he had imagined. Qin Yu walked for a long time but did not even see a wild beast.

“That’s strange. How can there be no wild beasts in this forest? ” Qin Yu thought to himself.

He released his divine sense and covered the majority of the forest. He was shocked to discover although the forest looked lush, its internal qi was actually very weak.

It was illogical in this Golden Age.

“Strange. Could it be some kind of neutralization of dark energy and spiritual energy in this place?” Qin Yu thought to himself.

At this moment, Qin Yu recalled the skeleton sitting cross-legged in the house and felt even more puzzled.

Even birds and beasts knew how to migrate, so why would the skeleton cultivate and die here? If he failed to comprehend dao here, even a fool would know to change place.

“Was the skeleton protecting something when it was alive?” Qin Yu became even more suspicious.

There must be a reason why that skeleton would rather die here than leave!

Qin Yu tried to release her divine sense and continue probing, but he found nothing.

Immediately after, Qin Yu’s figure shook, and he leaped high up into the sky.

He looked down at this huge mountain forest from top to bottom, wanting to see something out of it.

However, there was nothing unusual about this forest. Other than the leaves of the trees being a little dark, there was nothing else.

...

“Strange.” Rubbing his chin, Qin Yu became even more doubtful.

Just as he was about to give up, he suddenly noticed something unusual!

The entire mountain forest seemed to have been ingeniously divided into two parts. The left was a dense mountain forest, while the right was barren!

Between the left and right was a winding river that divided the entire forest into two parts.

“Hmm? This…” The more Qin Yu looked at it, the more familiar it felt.

The structure of the entire mountain forest seemed to resemble a Tai Chi Diagram! Although it was not obvious, one could still vaguely see its outline.

“This place is indeed not simple,” Qin Yu said in a deep voice.

He rubbed his chin as if he was thinking about something.

A moment later, Qin Yu suddenly realized! Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

He hurriedly jumped down and rushed in the direction of the house!

Qin Yu hurriedly leaped and looked down from above when he arrived at the house’s location.

...

“This position… It seems to be the position of the fish eye of the Tai Chi Diagram!” Qin Yu was incredibly shocked!

There were two fish eyes in the Tai Chi Diagram, the Yin Yang Fish. The house’s location happened to be in the position of the fish eyes!

The entire mountain forest seemed to have been artificially transformed. If one did not look carefully, not to mention the outline of the Tai Chi Diagram, one would not even be able to see the general appearance of the mountain forest!

“In that case… Someone had deliberately changed the mountains and rivers to hide the structure of the Tai Chi Diagram here,” Qin Yu said in a deep voice.

“In other words, the skeleton comprehended dao at the position of the fish eye, but for some reason, he passed away while sitting in the room.”

Qin Yu returned to the ground. He was thinking about something while walking.

“If I guess it correctly, there should be another house in the symmetrical direction of this house!” Qin Yu slapped his head and exclaimed!

The Yin Yang fish eyes of the Tai Chi Diagram were symmetrical. Since a house was found here, there must be another house in the symmetrical direction!
