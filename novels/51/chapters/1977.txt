1978 Pursuing a Narrow Gain While Neglecting a Greater Danger

Upon hearing this, Qin Yu’s eyes lit up, and he looked at the platform curiously.

Although it was called a sanctum, it was actually very small, only the size of a well cover.

However, such a small platform carried the cultivation and enlightenment of numerous predecessors. Only the heavens knew what terrifying dao techniques were left on it.

Qin Yu asked while trying to walk to the platform, “Your Highness, have you ever stepped onto this sanctum?”

!!

The prince laughed and said, “Of course. It’s not just me. The people of the nine great aristocratic families also sat cross-legged on it to comprehend dao but didn’t gain much from it. Gradually, this place declined and became like this. No one cares about it anymore.”

This caused Qin Yu to feel anticipated.

How could there be no gains in the place where every generation of the royal family comprehended the dao? The improvement would be beyond his imagination if he could gain something out of it.

Just as Qin Yu was about to sit down cross-legged, an attendant ran over in a panic.

“Your Highness, someone outside wants to see you,” the attendant said as he bowed.

The prince frowned slightly and said, “Who is it?”

“The party claimed he was a member of the Yao family,” the attendant said.

The prince was silent for a while before he sighed and said, “This day has finally come.”

Qin Yu also realized something was wrong. Of course, this matter most likely had nothing to do with him.

“Let’s go,” the prince said.

Qin Yu quickly followed him and said, “I’ll go with you.”

The prince said, waving his hand, “There’s no need. You can stay here.”

“Let’s go together. I don’t have a good relationship with the Yao family, to begin with,” Qin Yu said.

Seeing this, the prince did not say anything else. Therefore, the two followed behind the attendant and came to the Great Hall.

Dozens of people were standing in the Great Hall, led by two elderly men having tyrannical internal qi and extremely overbearing expressions.

As for the group of people behind him, they had cold expressions and were holding divine weapons.

“Prince of Great Xia, I’m the chief of the Yao family. I’ve come to Sky City under the orders of the family head,” the elderly man leading the group took a step forward and spoke expressionlessly.

“Is there anything, Chief Yao?” the prince asked smiling.

“A few days ago, there was an invasion by a foreign race,” Chief Yao said coldly. “They took away the supreme treasures of the auction. The family head is worried about Your Highness’s safety, so he sent us here to protect you.”

The prince had already prepared himself mentally. He remained calm and said, smiling, “I’ll have to trouble Chief Yao to inform the head of the Yao family that I thank him for his good intentions. However, there’s no need for that. My royal family has our own means of self-protection, so there’s no need for the head of the Yao family to worry.”

Chief Yao sneered. He took a step forward and said, “Let me stay. If anything happens to Yor Highness, it will be a misfortune for Zhongzhou.”

After saying that, he ignored the prince’s objection and immediately waved his hand. Subsequently, dozens of people stood in different positions.

Obviously, they didn’t take the prince’s words seriously. Regardless of whether the prince agreed or not, they would choose to stay.

The prince was silent, and his face was expressionless.

Qin Yu sighed.

D*mn it! It seemed that the royal family was going to exist in name only!

“Let’s go,” the prince got up and said at this moment.

“Are you just going to let them stay?” Qin Yu frowned and asked.

“What else can I do?” The prince laughed bitterly. “In my current state, I’m already very lucky enough to be able to survive.”

Qin Yu opened his mouth but did not know what to say.

“This is just the beginning. It won’t be long before Sky City is completely suppressed, and the royal family will eventually become history.” When the prince said this, a trace of sorrow and pain flashed across his face.

No one was willing to see their own family fall. This kind of psychological disappointment was very difficult to accept.

But the prince had no choice, and more so for Qin Yu.

…

In a small city, thousands of stars away from Sky City.

The city was so small that even cultivators could not be seen.

And in such a city, a few people were drinking and having fun.

“I must say you do have some ability,” an elderly man said indifferently. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

This elderly man was none other than the owner of the auction house, Yang Tong.

On the surface, Yang Tong was responsible for the prince, but in reality, he was a member of the nine great aristocratic families.

A young man was sitting opposite him. This young man was smiling and looked quite smug.

He was also an old acquaintance of Qin Yu, Gu Xinghe!

The entire plan was Gu Xinghe’s idea!

At this moment, he said smugly, “This is nothing. It’s just a small trick.”

“Such a sinister and cunning move, I am truly impressed,” the people around him said one after another.

Gu Xinghe didn’t think that way. To him, such methods were nothing.

“We have taken all the treasures, and there are people to take the blame for us. We can even let the great aristocratic families take over Sky City. We are killing three birds with one stone,” Gu Xinghe took a sip of wine and said proudly.

“That’s right. After this incident, I think the noble status of Sky City will slowly disappear,” Yang Tong said indifferently.

“Speaking of which, it’s all thanks to that mysterious person from the demon race. Without him, we couldn’t have such a good opportunity,” a young man beside him smiled faintly and said.

Gu Xinghe snorted and said, “He should be the scapegoat. No one can prove it anyway!”

...

With that, the few people in the room burst into laughter.

However, what they were not aware of was that a person sneakily appeared in the city.

He found the treasure’s hiding spot and used a secret technique to hide himself.

Such a secret technique could be considered top-notch in the entire Holy Region!

“D*mn! So many treasures,” this extremely wretched cultivator kept licking his lips.

“If they were displayed for an auction, I wouldn’t have a chance to get it. I didn’t expect the heavens to give me such an opportunity.”

After saying that, he immediately frantically stored these treasures in his Spatial Magical Artifact without delay.

Soon, all the treasures were in his hands.

“Tsk! Tsk! I’m still the wisest. This is called pursuing a narrow gain while neglecting a greater danger,” he said with a smile.

This person was none other than the man with the mustache.

Wherever there were treasures, he would be there.

...

And this batch of auction items just happened to have the treasures he needed.

He initially wanted to find an opportunity to steal it, but he had an unexpected harvest.

After keeping away the treasures, the man with the mustache sneakily left a sentence at the scene, “I’ve cleaned up this mess for you. Don’t ask me who I am. I don’t leave my name when I do good deeds!”

After doing all this, the man with the mustache flickered a few times and went out of sight.

When Gu Xinghe and the rest saw this, their faces were full of anger.
