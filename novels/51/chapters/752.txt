Chapter 753: Beheading! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

The huge ball of light was sucked into Qin Yu’s stomach!

The ball of light became smaller and smaller until it completely disappeared!

Qin Yu patted his stomach and burped with a satisfied expression on his face.

“Not bad. How comfortable.” Qin Yu grinned.

Ao Zhan, who wasn’t far away, had an extremely ugly expression! His forehead was covered with layers of sweat.

“How... how is this possible...” Ao Zhan swallowed hard, as if he couldn’t believe the scene in front of him.

Qin Yu looked at Ao Zhan coldly and said, “If this is your trump card, then you will die.”

Ao Zhan gritted his teeth, grabbed the crossbow, and said coldly, “Qin Yu, don’t be so arrogant!”

After saying that, Ao Zhan seemed to have gone crazy. He grabbed the crossbow in his hand and kept casting spells toward Qin Yu!

The overwhelming light almost destroyed the entire ground!

However, Qin Yu, who was covered in golden light, wasn’t affected at all.

After a series of indiscriminate attacks, Qin Yu was still intact.

“Are you done? It’s my turn,” Qin Yu said coldly.

Ao Zhan wiped the sweat from his forehead. Just as he was about to speak, Qin Yu’s figure disappeared into thin air!

In the next second, he felt a golden light flash in front of his eyes.

Then, a huge fist smashed fiercely at the crossbow!

“Boom!”

This fist contained a force of ten thousand tons. The golden light turned into substance and directly smashed the crossbow into pieces!

The weapon Ao Zhan was proud of turned into ruins just like that!

“You... you actually destroyed my weapon!” Ao Zhan’s face was extremely pale!

Qin Yu sneered and said, “As far as I know, most of your strength came from this weapon, right?”

Ao Zhan’s face was pale and he didn’t say a word.

“Without this weapon, I’m afraid that your title as a peak-stage Martial Marquis is undeserved.” Qin Yu looked down at Ao Zhan with a cold killing intent in his eyes.

Ao Zhan gritted his teeth and roared, “Qin Yu, don’t be arrogant!”

After saying that, Ao Zhan clenched his fist and swung it fiercely at Qin Yu!

Ao Zhan was, after all, at the peak-stage Martial Marquis realm, so his strength was naturally self-evident.

However, when this punch landed on Qin Yu’s body, it actually didn’t injure him in the slightest. Instead, it shook his wrist until it hurt!

“This... this...” Ao Zhan took two steps back. A trace of panic flashed across his face, and then he took off to run!

But how could Qin Yu give him a chance? A huge golden hand slammed Ao Zhan onto the ground with one palm!

A huge palm print instantly appeared on the ground.

Ao Zhan’s body was almost smashed into meat paste!

Before Ao Zhan could get up, a golden fist had already descended from the sky!

“Boom!”

With this punch, Ao Zhan’s spine was directly shattered! Dozens of bones were instantly shattered into fine powder!

Ao Zhan wanted to get up, but he found that there was no support from the bones, and he couldn’t stand up at all!

“What, is this the peak of the Martial Marquis Realm? It’s just so-so.” Qin Yu looked at Ao Zhan coldly.

Ao Zhan said in pain, “Spare me... I beg you... spare me...”

“Spare you? You murderer, you’ve already lived for dozens of years. It’s time for you to pay the price,” Qin Yu said coldly.

Ao Zhan wanted to say something, but Qin Yu didn’t give him a chance.

He reached out his palm and grabbed Ao Zhan’s dantian.

In the next second, Qin Yu pulled Ao Zhan’s Golden Core out of his abdomen.

Ao Zhan’s internal qi was quickly drained. In a moment, he had turned into an ice-cold corpse.

Qin Yu played with the Golden Core and was surprised to find that it was much bigger than all the other Golden Cores he had seen before.

“Could it be that the Golden Core at the peak of the Martial Marquis realm is bigger?” Qin Yu thought to himself.

He wasn’t in a hurry to swallow the Golden Core into his stomach. Instead, he planned to keep it for the time being and use it when he broke through to the Martial Saint realm in the future.

After taking the Golden Core, Qin Yu carried Ao Zhan’s corpse and walked towards Yao Meng.

“You’re strength is really shocking,” Yao Meng said with a smile.

“It’s really surprising that you gained such strength in just two years.”

Qin Yu smiled and said, “Miss Yao, you flatter me.”

Wan Guqiong couldn’t help but sigh and said, “No wonder Miss Yan likes you. I have to say, you is really like a peerless hero, full of charm.”

Their praise made Qin Yu feel a little embarrassed.

“If there’s nothing else, I’ll take my leave first,” said Qin Yu.

Yao Meng smiled and said, “Okay, see you in a few days at the Martial Arts Academy.”

Qin Yu agreed, then he took Ao Zhan’s body and left.

...

The next day.

Granny Qin had just left the Jingdu Martial Arts Association and was about to go to the Martial Arts Academy when she saw the body hanging on the gate.

Granny Qin’s expression changed drastically when she saw this corpse!

Even though Ao Zhan’s body was almost shattered, Granny Qin still recognized his identity at a glance.

“Ao Zhan... is actually dead.” Granny Qin’s expression was extremely cold.

“Granny Qin, what’s going on?” Xia Hang also followed out and asked while pretending to be shocked.

Granny Qin didn’t answer but waved her hand and said, “Get someone to dispose of the corpse.”

“Yes!” Xia Hang hurriedly nodded.

He was filled with excitement.

He had never thought that Ao Zhan would actually be killed by Qin Yu!

One had to know that he was at the peak Martial Marquis realm!

“It seems that my choice wasn’t wrong,” Xia Hang thought to himself.

Granny Qin didn’t stay any longer. She turned around and walked towards the Martial Arts Academy.

After arriving at the Martial Arts Academy, Granny Qin went straight to Blackie’s room.

“Granny Qin.” Seeing Granny Qin, Blackie immediately stood up.

Granny Qin said in a deep voice, “Blackie, come with me immediately.”

“Where are we going?” Blackie asked in surprise.

Granny Qin said coldly, “I want to take you to the Mystic Realm. We can’t wait any longer.”

“To the Mystic Realm?” Blackie was even more confused.

Granny Qin glanced at him and said, “Ao Zhan died at the hands of Qin Yu. This is enough to show that the current Qin Yu is no longer the same as before.” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“In order to prevent any accidents, I want to take you to bathe in Yan Ruoxue’s blood and pass on her bloodline power.”

Blackie smiled and said, “Granny Qin, there’s no need for that. Qin Yu isn’t worth mentioning.”

“Yeah, I’m just a nobody. Why bother?” At this moment, Qin Yu suddenly appeared at the door.

Granny Qin’s expression turned cold and she said with a sinister tone, “Qin Yu, who told you to come here?!”

Qin Yu glanced at Blackie and said with a slightly mocking tone, “It seems that you don’t have much confidence in this beast that you raised.”

“Qin Yu, you’re courting death!” Upon hearing that, Blackie immediately took a step forward and the internal qi on his body suddenly exploded!
