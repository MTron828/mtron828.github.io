1991 The Furious Qin Yu

Facing a Semi-Saint, even Qin Yu suffered appalling injuries. He had no chance of winning.

Everyone sighed. A heaven’s favorite was probably going to die here today just because he didn’t have any backing,

“Finally, finally…” Gu Xinghe didn’t conceal the excitement on his face. He couldn’t wait to tear Qin Yu’s body to shreds.

They were both cruel and merciless, but Gu Xinghe did not have the aspiration He Teng had. All he wanted was for the man in front of him to die!

This time, He Teng also did not show up.

The Semi-Saint walked to Qin Yu and looked down at him. He said indifferently, “Your strength is not bad. Unfortunately, you’ve provoked the wrong person.”

After saying that, he lifted Qin Yu up with one hand.

After using the power of the sun and moon, he was somewhat exhausted, and his internal qi was not at its peak. However, it was not a problem for him to catch hold of Qin Yu, who was already half-dead.

Gu Xinghe, who was not far away, came to Qin Yu excitedly.

Looking down at Qin Yu, his face was full of madness.

“Qin Yu, I didn’t expect you to end up in such a manner!” Gu Xinghe’s eyes were ferocious as he raised his foot and stepped on Qin Yu’s body!

Qin Yu’s mouth opened, and blood kept gushing out.

“What else do you want to say?” Gu Xinghe said somewhat sarcastically.

Qin Yu opened his mouth with difficulty. Looking at Wen Da and Wen Er who were standing behind Gu Xinghe, Qin Yu said in a trembling voice, “Release… Release the two of them…”

Gu Xinghe was stunned. He turned to look at Wen Da and Wen Er and laughed heartily. “What did you say just now? You wanted me to release the two of them, did you? Hahaha! Qin Yu, if you weren’t so soft-hearted, you wouldn’t have to die now!”

Qin Yu was angry, but he couldn’t do anything.

Gu Xinghe waved his hand, snorted coldly, and said, “Kill him.”

“Mmm,” the Semi-Saint responded and raised his hand, ready to take Qin Yu’s life.

“Stop!”

At this moment, the prince’s voice sounded from not far away.

He came to Qin Yu under the lead of his two attendants.

Gu Xinghe furrowed his brows slightly and said, “Your Highness, this has nothing to do with you. We didn’t make a move in Sky City.”

The prince smiled, bowed slightly, and said, “Please give me some face. Please let Qin Yu go.”

“Let Qin Yu go?” Gu Xinghe’s expression turned cold. Then he said coldly, “Your Highness, stop joking. I spent so much effort to capture him, and now you want me to let him go? Don’t you think you’re being too nosy?”

“Your Highness, please don’t get involved in this,” the Semi-Saint by the side also said coldly. “This is not just our wish, but the Si family and the nine great aristocratic families’ wish.”

Gu Xinghe, beside him, sneered and said, “Your Highness, you asked us to give you face, but do you think you deserve it?”

These words clearly showed this group of people didn’t even want to maintain their pretense.

The prince was silent. He stood there for a long time and then sighed.

With a wave of his hand, two tremendously old men suddenly appeared beside the prince.

Although these two elderly men were old and withered, the sense of oppression they exuded was still frightening!

Not to mention Gu Xinghe, even the expressions of the other Semi-Saints turned ugly.

“Your Highness, what do you mean by this? Do you want to start a war with the Si family?” The Semi-Saint said coldly.

The prince said, shaking his head, “I definitely don’t want to fall out with the Si family. Since you said it was the Si family’s business, you should at least bring him back to the Si family and let them deal with him.”

“We’re the Si family!” Gu Xinghe said hurriedly.

The prince glanced at Gu Xinghe, laughed, and said, “I’m afraid you’re not influential enough in the Si family. At the very least, Si Shifeng should handle this matter.”

The prince paused, looked at the Semi-Saint smiling, and said, “What do you think?”

The Semi-Saint was silent.

He looked at the prince, then the two elderly men beside him. He sighed and said, “Alright, Your Highness, we’ll give you face and bring him back to the Si family.”

“No! We can’t bring him back to the Si family. We must kill him immediately!” Gu Xinghe was anxious! He didn’t want to miss such a good opportunity!

If anything happened on their way, everything would be in vain!

No matter how Gu Xinghe tried to stop it, his words did not carry much weight, and no one paid him any attention.

“Your Highness, I’m bringing him to the Si family now. I’ll also tell the elders that this is your wish,” the Semi-Saint said coldly.

His words were full of threats, and the prince naturally knew it.

But he stayed calm and collected, only smiled and said, “Alright. I’ll have to trouble you then.”

The Semi-Saint snorted coldly. Without saying anything, he was about to pick up Qin Yu and take him back.

At this moment, Qin Yu opened his mouth with difficulty.

He looked at Gu Xinghe and said in a trembling voice, “Release… Release Wen Da and Wen Er go first…”

Gu Xinghe’s face darkened, and his eyes were about to spit fire.

Gu Xinghe, who was already furious but had nowhere to vent his anger, was even more furious after hearing Qin Yu’s words!

“Let them go? You’re dreaming!” Gu Xinghe shouted angrily.

He looked at the prince and said coldly, “Your Highness, if I kill the two of them, it has nothing to do with you, right?”

Qin Yu’s pupils shrank when he heard that!

He stared at Gu Xinghe and said with all his might, “No… Don’t!”

But Gu Xinghe ignored Qin Yu. He raised his hand and grabbed Wen Da’s neck!

...

After that, a crisp cracking sound was heard. Wen Da’s neck was instantly broken.

His internal qi disappeared rapidly. In just a few seconds, Wen Da’s head hung down, and there was no longer any sign of life.

Staring at the scene in front of him, Qin Yu’s eyes were scarlet red, and his whole body was trembling!

“Wen… Wen Da…” Qin Yu’s body trembled like a sieve, his heart beat violently, and a wave of anger rushed to the top of his head!

At this moment, Qin Yu’s eyes turned scarlet completely, and an incredibly terrifying power suddenly burst out from his body!

“I want you to die… I want you to die!”

An explosive shout was heard. Qin Yu, on the verge of death, burst his internal qi to the extreme at this moment! Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

His body was once again dyed with the Golden Light, and his powerful internal qi instantly forced everyone to step backward. An extremely terrifying killing intent enveloped heaven and earth, causing everyone to shiver!

“What… What’s going on? Qin Yu… How could he have such power?”

“What a terrifying internal qi. It’s much stronger than just now!”

Gu Xinghe’s expression changed drastically! Seeing things not right, he left Wen Er behind, turned, and run!

...

Qin Yu raised his head and roared. The terrifying Golden Light swept out in all directions with him as the center!

“Boom!”

It was as if a cannonball exploded, and the few Semi-Saints were instantly sent flying!
