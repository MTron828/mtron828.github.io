Chapter 524: He Must Not Be Allowed to Leave Jingdu! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Qin Yu looked coldly at the man with the mustache and said, “I thought you had forgotten.”

The man with the mustache jumped down from the wall and said with a smile, “How is that possible? I have always kept my word!”

Qin Yu looked at the man with the mustache and said, “Then don’t waste time. Hurry up and set off.”

“This is your fault. I came all the way here and didn’t even drink a mouthful of water. You should at least give me a meal, right?” The man with the mustache said with a smile.

Although Qin Yu was anxious, he couldn’t do anything about the man with the mustache.

Helpless, he could only bring the man with the mustache back to the living room.

“Yao Qing, go and order some food,” Qin Yu said to Yao Qing.

The man with the mustache waved his hand and said, “No need to be so polite. Don’t overdo it. A banquet will do!”

Yao Qing glared at the man with the mustache and muttered, “You really don’t stand on ceremony.”

The man with the mustache giggled and said, “Of course!”

This made them puzzled. What was with the proud look on the man’s face?

Yao Qing ordered some food. The man with the mustache seemed like he had been starving for a few days and he wolfed down his food.

Taozi, who was beside him, frowned.

She tugged at Qin Yu and whispered, “Mr. Qin, who is this person? Why does he look so annoying?”

Qin Yu spread his hands and didn’t know how to explain.

“You can call him the man with the mustache,” Qin Yu said somewhat helplessly.

The way the man with the mustache ate was too coarse, so Yao Qing and Taozi didn’t dare to come to the table.

The man ate for nearly an hour before he patted his stomach in satisfaction.

“Let’s go!” The man with the mustache stood up and said.

“Wait.” At this moment, Qin Yu stopped the man with the mustache.

“I have something to ask you.” Qin Yu looked at the man with the mustache.

Then, he brought the man with the mustache to the bedroom. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

The person lying on the bed was Fang Yue.

Qin Yu pointed at Fang Yue and said, “She has been unconscious for almost a month. Do you know what’s with her?”

The man with the mustache rolled his eyes and said, “You are an Elder of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion. How would I know something that you can’t do anything about?”

Qin Yu frowned and explained the whole process to the man with the mustache.

After the man with the mustache heard it, he also frowned slightly.

“Used her to summon the Dragon Spirit?” The man with the mustache touched his chin and whispered.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “Yes. From then on, she was unconscious and her internal qi was very weak.”

The man with the mustache was silent for a moment and said, “I did read something similar in an ancient book, but it has been too long since and I have forgotten about it.”

Then, the man with the mustache said, “How about this? Give me some time and let me recall it.”

“Okay.” Qin Yu nodded.

Anyway, Fang Yue had been asleep for so long, so a few more days wouldn’t make a big difference.

Then, Qin Yu said goodbye to Yao Qing and the others and followed the man with the mustache to the three Big Graves.

...

Jingdu Martial Arts Association.

In the meeting room, a few higher-ups were still hiding in the darkness.

“Xia Hang is right. Qin Yu probably has something to do with that person.”

“Could it be that the prediction from more than ten years ago is really about to come true?”

At the mention of the prediction, several higher-ups fell into silence once again.

“In order to prevent accidents, no matter what, we can’t let Qin Yu leave Jingdu.” A woman’s voice was heard.

“On September 9th, mobilize three Martial Marquises and kill Qin Yu.”

“As long as he dares to appear, no matter what price we have to pay, we must kill him!”

Three Martial Marquises!

The Jingdu Martial Arts Association hadn’t sent out any Martial Marquises for more than ten years!

And now, they actually mobilized three Martial Marquises! This was enough to show how alarmed they were!

As for the “person” and “prediction” they spoke of, no one knew what it was. This seemed to be a secret of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association.

...

Qin Yu followed the man with the mustache to the first Big Grave.

The first Big Grave was in a shabby village in the Central Plains.

This village was desolate and uninhabited. Within a radius of several miles, it was showing signs of decline.

It was said that countless feng shui masters had come to perform the ritual, but in the end, they all ended up in a sorry state.

“What strong dark energy.” As soon as he arrived at the village, Qin Yu couldn’t help but be slightly surprised.

Such strong dark energy rivaled that of the Dark Energy Grave under the Dragon Vein!

Qin Yu hurriedly looked at the man with the mustache and asked, “Where is the tomb?”

The man with the mustache glanced at Qin Yu. He stepped on the ground and said, “The whole village is a Big Grave.”

Qin Yu couldn’t help but be stunned.

This was the Big Grave? What was buried there?

The man with the mustache seemed to see through Qin Yu’s doubts and said, “According to my speculation, this place used to be a human sacrifice and a burial pit.”

Qin Yu frowned and found it hard to accept.

According to the man with the mustache, many people were buried alive here.

Perhaps it was because of this that the dark energy here was particularly prevalent.

“Alright, let’s hurry up. We still have to go to the next Big Grave,” the man with the mustache muttered.

“Okay.” Qin Yu said no more.

He sat cross-legged on the ground and began to absorb the dark energy from nature.

In the blink of an eye, three days had passed.

Qin Yu sat cross-legged on the ground. The surrounding dark energy was like a stream flowing like the sea and it was disappearing bit by bit.

In just a few short days, the dark energy here began to disappear. Even the man with the mustache was somewhat surprised at the speed.

At this time, it was already August 21st. There were only 19 days left until September 9th.

The Yan family and the Han family had already decided on the location of the wedding.

This location was in a huge manor on the outskirts of Jingdu.

The main manor was located on a huge mountain, far away from the public’s view. It was a good place to kill people.

Today, several uninvited guests arrived.

They looked weak, but their internal qi was extremely powerful.

These people were top-notch Martial Marquis Realm martial artists!

“If the Han family’s kid can get rid of him, that would be the best,” one of them said coldly.

“If he can’t do it, we must act immediately and quickly get rid of him!”
