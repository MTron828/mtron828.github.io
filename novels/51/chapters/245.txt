A dangerous aura spread out from his internal qi. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Han Yilong felt a strong sense of fear inside!

He tried to struggle, but he found that the internal qi in his body seemed to be suppressed!

Han Yilong knew very well that this was a feeling created by the huge difference in strength!

“You... let go of me!” Han Yilong shouted angrily.

Qin Yu sneered. “What, are you afraid?”

“Why the f * ck would I be afraid of you?!” Han Yilong immediately flew into a rage!

He clenched his left fist and thrust it at Qin Yu!

“Slap!”

However, before his fist could touch Qin Yu, he was slapped in the face.

Although the slap wasn’t heavy, it was extremely insulting!

The dignified young master of the Han family was actually slapped in front of everyone!

“You... you’re courting death!” Han Yilong roared angrily and rushed towards Qin Yu like he had gone mad!

Qin Yu’s expression was calm. He lightly stomped his feet and a surge of surging spiritual energy spread out in all directions with Qin Yu as the center!

“Boom!”

Under this huge force, Han Yilong’s body was sent flying before he could even touch Qin Yu!

There were many fractures on his body, and his calves were bent backward in an extremely strange arc.

His mouth was also dripping with blood, and he looked miserable.

Everyone was dumbstruck and dumbfounded!

Han Yilong was actually unable to fight back against Qin Yu?

“Didn’t they say... that powerful families have a very strong foundation? How could Han Yilong lose so miserably?”

“Could it be that Qin Yu had hidden his strength?”

Everyone discussed animatedly, but they didn’t dare to speak loudly.

“You aren’t my match.” Qin Yu looked coldly at Han Yilong with the corners of his mouth curling up into a contemptuous smile.

At this moment, Han Yilong didn’t care about appearances anymore.

He glared at Qin Yu and laughed maniacally. “Hahaha! So what?! Even if you are strong, you will still die today!”

“As long as I give the order, everyone here will rise up and attack you!” Han Yilong said gloomily.

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes.

He glanced at everyone.

At least half of these people were willing to work for Han Yilong.

Money and power made them willing to be his lap dogs.

“Han Yilong has never treated any of you as human. Could it be that all of you like being lap dogs?” Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and said coldly.

“Cut the crap! Qin Yu, don’t even think about tricking people!” Zhang Hua cursed.

“Today, we will definitely get rid of you for Young Master Han!” Zhang Hua put his hands behind his back and acted like a top-notch martial artist.

Qin Yu didn’t say anything. He swept his gaze around and said coldly, “Do you think so too?”

“That’s right!” Chen Meng walked out.

He sneered and said, “Qin Yu, you’re just lucky. Do you think you can go from rags to riches? You have to die here today.”

The situation was tense and terrifying.

Jiang Gu’s expression was somewhat ugly. There were at least ten Inner Strength Grandmasters here, and there was no lack of third level Inner Strength Grandmasters among them.

Even if they risked their lives, it was impossible to defeat them!

“Mr. Qin...” Jiang Gu muttered in a low voice, as if he wanted to dissuade him.

Qin Yu’s face didn’t show the slightest emotion.

He looked at everyone coldly and said, “I don’t believe that everyone is willing to work for Han Yilong.”

“Hahahaha!” Han Yilong laughed loudly.

“Qin Yu, you’re really childish!”

“Under the Han family’s deterrence, who dares to disobey?”

“Come, those who are willing to fight for me, stand on my side!” Han Yilong shouted.

The crowd began to become restless.

The first to stand by Han Yilong’s side were Zhang Hua and Chen Meng.

“Jing Lu, are we going to pick a side?” Duan Shi asked in a low voice.

Jing Lu shook his head and said indifferently, “There’s no rush. We’ll talk about it after the situation has stabilized.”

Duan Shi agreed and didn’t say anything more.

“Master, what should we do?” The people around Dong Tianhai also asked in a low voice.

Dong Tianhai shook his head and didn’t seem to be in a hurry to take sides.

Soon, everyone split into two groups.

There were at least 70 to 80 people standing beside Han Yilong in a group of nearly 100 people.

The remaining people didn’t seem to want to get involved in this matter.

“Mr. Qin, I’m afraid you’re in danger.” Fang Yue shook her head.

“Forgive me for not being able to accompany you. I’ll take my leave,” Fang Yue said softly.

Qin Yu nodded.

He and Fang Yue had only met by chance. There was no reason for her to risk her life for him.

“Qin Yu, what else do you want to say?” Zhang Hua grinned.

“There are so many of us. You’re no match against us!”

“You’d better kneel down and apologize to Young Master Han right now. Perhaps Young Master Han will spare your life!”

Zhang Hua was cursing non-stop. It was obvious that he wanted to take advantage of this opportunity to get on the good side of the Han family.

Qin Yu glanced at him and sneered. “You’re just a lap dog of the Han family. What right do you have to make a fuss here?”

“You!” Zhang Hua was instantly furious, but he couldn’t retort.

“What about me?” Han Yilong said with a nonchalant smile.

“What Zhang Hua said is what I think as well.”

Qin Yu still shook his head and said, “You’re just from a side branch of the Han family. Do you really think that you’re the legitimate young master of the Han Family?”

“I reckon that you don’t even have the right to sit at the table when the Han family gathers, right? Your position in the Han family is no different from that of a servant.”

Qin Yu’s words caused Han Yilong’s expression to change drastically once again!

Just as Qin Yu had said, Han Yilong really didn’t have much weight in the Han family!

Compared to a legitimate heir like Han Wei, he was nothing!

“Qin Yu, you’ve provoked me time and time again. I must kill you today!” Han Yilong said through gritted teeth.

“Please give the order, Young Master Han. I’ll kill him with my own hands right now!” Zhang Hua shouted.

“That’s right, Young Master Han. With your command, we will definitely attack him as a group.”

Qin Yu swept his gaze across the crowd and coldly said, “I’ll ask you one last time. Are you guys really going to make a move on me?”

“Cut the crap. One is Young Master Han, while the other is a trash with an empty title. The winner is obvious!” Zhang Hua coldly snorted.

Everyone nodded in agreement and their eyes revealed a strong killing intent.

Qin Yu’s internal qi also began to slowly change.

He glanced at everyone and coldly said, “Fine, then I’ll kill all of you!”
