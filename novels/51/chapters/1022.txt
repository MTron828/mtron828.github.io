Chapter 1023: Chapter 1,023, the Declaration of war

Everyone looked at each other and did not know what to do.

The news that Qiao Zun was about to become a martial saint had long spread throughout the martial arts world.

Many people raised their heads and looked at the pill cloud that had formed. They could not help but sigh.

“It seems that Qiao Zun is going to succeed.”

“If he succeeds in becoming a martial saint, it will definitely be bad news for us.”

Soon after, there was news:

“Qiao ZUN has successfully become a martial saint! He even announced that he would become the number one person in the world!”

Before the many martial artists were worried, there was another piece of news:

“Qiao Zun is dead! He was killed by three punches! The person who attacked him was none other than Qin Yu, who had disappeared for many days!”

The two pieces of news took less than ten minutes to confuse everyone.

Qin Yu had killed Qiao Zun with three punches? Wasn’t this too F * cking ridiculous?

Even if Qin Yu had successfully become a martial saint, it was impossible for him to kill a martial saint with three punches!

Just as everyone was suspecting, a video had already been uploaded.

In the video, Qiao Zun knelt at Qin Yu’s feet like a dead dog.

Within a few minutes, his divine sense had been chopped off!

“Qin Yu... really killed Qiao Zun with three punches!”

“Damn, as expected of Qin Yu! After he became a martial saint, he is indeed invincible!”

“Too strong, this is too strong! Even the second mystic realm’s star seizer might not be able to do it!”

On the nine Pinnacles Mountain, everyone was extremely excited as they watched the video.

“Hahahahaha!”

Chang Mang could not help but laugh out loud.

“As expected of Qin Yu! Good job!”

Kong Yun’s face was gloomy as he said in a low voice, “Looks like we have to work hard too.”

...

Divine Alchemist Pavilion.

Wan Gu Qiong sized up the pavilion master with a serious expression.

Pavilion master narrowed his eyes slightly and completely ignored wan gu Qiong.

This made Wan Gu Qiong extremely displeased.

He had come to the Divine Alchemist pavilion many times, but he was rejected every time.

“Damn it!”

Finally, Wan Gu Qiong could not hold it in anymore!

He flipped the table in front of him and said angrily, “I didn’t do anything to you out of respect for ye Qing. Don’t think that I’m really afraid of him!”

Pavilion master’s expression did not change and he did not say a word.

“Alright, are you forcing me?”Wan Gu Qiong’s face was gloomy.

“After I’m done with you, you’ll run away. I want to see what ye Qing can do to me!”

After he finished speaking, wan gu qiong bared his fangs and brandished his claws as he pounced towards the pavilion master!

The pavilion master furrowed his brows tightly. Just as he was about to get up, someone pushed open the door and entered.

“Who the F * ck let you in!”

This made Wan Gu Qiong extremely angry.

“Young Master Wan, I’m afraid we have to leave quickly.”The martial saint of the Wan family said coldly.

Wan Gu Qiong said with a dark expression, “Leave? Where Are We Going?”

The martial saint of the Wan family continued, “Qin Yu has become a martial saint and killed Qiao Zun with three punches. If we don’t Leave Now, I’m afraid it will be too late.”

Wan Gu Qiong’s expression changed drastically when he heard these words!

He took the phone and watched the video in fear.

When he saw Qin Yu’s extremely powerful strength, beads of sweat immediately rolled down his forehead!

“Damn it...”Wan Gu Qiong cursed in his heart. He picked up his clothes from the ground and turned around to leave.

“Quick, return to the mystic realm immediately, Quick!”Wan Gu Qiong’s face was filled with fear, not daring to stay for even a moment.

At this moment, Qin Yu had already brought many disciples of the Heaven Gate back to the previous Jade Moon Villa.

This place had already been reduced to ruins and dilapidated beyond repair.

However, there was still a secret realm here. Hence, using this place as a base was undoubtedly the best choice.

“Let’s settle down here temporarily,”Qin Yu said.

“Yes, sect master!”The three hundred cavalry shouted in unison!

Everyone spent some time to tidy up the Jade Moon Villa.

Although it wasn’t as prosperous as before, at least it could accommodate people.

Before long, people came to celebrate.

Chang Mang and the others also came down from the nine Pinnacles Mountain to congratulate Qin Yu!

For a time, the Green Moon Villa was full of guests!

“Congratulations, Brother Qin, for stepping into the Martial Saint Realm!”Zhuang Teng seemed to have walked out from his sadness and smiled to congratulate Qin Yu.

“Today, Brother Qin has stepped into the martial saint realm. The martial artists of this age can be considered to have some say.”Chu Heng sighed slightly.

“Qin Yu, I knew that you would be the first one to become a martial saint!”

In the face of everyone’s congratulations, Qin Yu also stood up and thanked them one by one.

“Qin Yu, who are those people in black robes outside?”Chang Mang asked in puzzlement.

Qin Yu said, “They are my disciples.”

“Disciples?”When everyone heard this, they could not help but be slightly stunned. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Qin Yu hummed in gratitude and said, “They are only a part of them. The rest are still waiting for orders in the Sheng Kingdom.”

“TSK, tsk. To be able to form a team in such a short time, that’s impressive.”

“That’s nothing. With Brother Qin’s current appeal, I think it’s not impossible for him to replace the martial arts association of Jingdu with a wave of his arm!”

“That’s exactly what I intend to do,”Qin Yu said in a deep voice.

As soon as he said this, Zhuang Teng and the others couldn’t help but widen their eyes.

“Qin Yu, we were just joking. Don’t take it seriously.”Zhuang Teng patted Qin Yu’s shoulder.

“That’s right. The Martial Arts Association of Jingdu is deeply rooted. It Won’t be easy to replace them.”

“It’s better to take things one step at a time. No one knows what power the martial arts association of Jingdu has.”

“What’s there to be afraid of! What’s so great about the martial arts association of Jingdu?”Chang Mang snorted coldly.

With that, he walked forward and said, “Qin Yu, when you attack the Martial Arts Association of Jingdu, Bring Me along!”

“Okay, no problem.”Qin Yu nodded.

After saying this, Qin Yu slowly stood up from his chair.

He swept his gaze over everyone and coldly said, “Spread the word that Heaven Gate has officially declared war on the Martial Arts Association of Jingdu and the Second Secret Realm!”
