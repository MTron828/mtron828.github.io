Chapter 1618: Chapter 1618, iron egg V S Sima bei 1 Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Sima bei’s entire body was exuding an ice-cold aura. His arrival had caused the situation to change once again.

As one of the four great godly monarchs, Sima Bei’s strength was not inferior to anyone else. It was not an exaggeration to say that the current Sima Bei was the number one person below the Void Return Stage!

“Sima Bei, are you bullying me because there’s no one else in the Southern Region!”Someone shouted loudly.

Sima bei glanced at him. Then, he stretched out his palm and gently pinched with his fingers. Immediately, he crushed the person who spoke into a meat paste!

He coldly glanced at everyone and said with a proud tone, “In the entire southern region, other than Xiao Hai and the sect leader of the Heavenly Cloud Sect, who else do i, Sima Bei, Fear?”

Qin Yu’s expression was ice-cold. He took a step forward and coldly said, “Looks like the main character today is not Yongji, but you, Sima Bei.”

Sima bei narrowed his eyes and said, “Qin Yu, I will not give you any chance to catch your breath. Today, you must die here! Including Qu Zhu and the others!”

“That will depend on whether you have the ability or not.”Qin Yu’s internal Qi became stronger and stronger. Even the surrounding space became slightly distorted.

Sima bei narrowed his eyes and sneered, “In just a few days, your strength has increased again. It’s really terrifying. However... it ends here!”

“Wait!”At this moment, someone from the crowd stood out.

He shouted at Sima bei, “We can give up the northern border and allow you to enter the Northern Territory, but the condition is that you can not enter the other regions of the South Province. How about it?”

Hearing his words, Qin Yu felt a headache.

The stupidity of these people had already exceeded their imagination. Even now, they still had this kind of fantasy.

When Sima bei heard these words, he even laughed out loud.

He swept his gaze over everyone and laughed coldly, “Back then, we were willing to negotiate because there was still Xiao Hai in the southern region. Now that Xiao Hai is dead, what right do you have to talk to me? Do you have the qualifications to do so?”

Traces of despair appeared on everyone’s faces.

At this moment, they finally understood that the northern lands wanted to exterminate everyone! He simply did not intend to let anyone go!

“Then let’s fight. Stop talking nonsense!”

Qin Yu took a step forward, and golden light flourished. Divine power that could destroy everything in its path lingered around the Golden Fist, and he instantly arrived in front of Sima bei!

Sima bei’s expression turned cold. He did not dare to be negligent. He immediately extended his palm, and streams of black aura gathered, wrapping around his palm. His internal Qi surged out from his palm, and the black aura surged out.

“Boom!”

At the instant of the collision, this black radiance seemed to have exploded. A terrifying power swept out instantly!

Qin Yu only felt his palm go numb. The powerful impact almost spread throughout his entire body!

“Is this Sima Bei’s true body?”Qin Yu’s expression turned cold. He immediately felt a trace of unease in his heart.

No wonder Sima Bei was so confident. His strength was indeed terrifying!

Sima bei looked coldly at Qin Yu and said, “Your strength is indeed shocking. No wonder I wasn’t able to kill you last time.”

Qin Yu didn’t want to waste any more words with him. In the face of such a person, other than fighting, everything else was just empty talk!

He immediately took out the bracelet that Xiao Yu had given him and planned to activate this magical artifact to force Sima Bei back!

But right at this moment, Qin Yu felt an intense murderous aura!

This murderous aura enveloped the world, causing everyone to shudder.

Even Sima Bei’s expression changed slightly, because this murderous aura even covered him!

“Old Thing, why don’t I try it with you!”

A loud shout spread throughout the world, shaking people’s ears until they felt pain!

Following that, a figure shot over explosively. His move was extremely fierce and vicious, heading straight for Sima Bei’s glabella!

Sima Bei’s expression changed. A black radiance appeared in front of him, and a large hand stretched out from the black radiance!

“Chi la!”

That figure’s palm grabbed directly at this large hand. Then, he suddenly exerted force and actually directly threw Sima bei out!

“Iron Egg? !”

Seeing the newcomer, Qin Yu could not help but be greatly shocked!

Iron Egg glanced at Qin Yu, and he grinned and said, “How can such a thing not include me? The last time at the Death River, my hand was itchy. I didn’t expect that this god King would actually come to the South Province today...”

Sima Bei’s expression was also a little ugly. He said with a cold face, “Who are you?”

Iron egg sneered, “You can call me the number one Asura! Of course, you don’t need to know so much.”

“Number one Asura? Why haven’t I heard of it?”Sima bei frowned slightly.

“Don’t worry, this name will soon spread all over the country...”iron egg grinned.

After saying that, he suddenly shot towards Sima bei!

His attack method was also extremely simple, just like Qin Yu, it was all based on his body!

Sima Bei’s expression turned cold as he shouted, “No matter who you are, if you obstruct the good things of the northern lands, you will die!”

After saying that, Sima bei muttered to himself. The space in front of him trembled and tens of millions of rays of light formed from the interweaving of the laws of heaven and earth condensed into an arm, heading towards Iron Egg.

“Boom!”

The huge collision caused the entire back mountain to start collapsing. Countless people vomited blood because of it, and some people were even directly smashed into meat paste!

The huge hand that was interwoven was easily pierced through by iron egg. His entire body emitted an intense killing intent, causing people to be terrified!

Sima Bei’s expression changed greatly, and he hurriedly shot backwards, standing in a safe position.

“TSK TSK, as expected of a divine body, as expected of a divine body of the reversion void stage!”A greedy expression appeared on Iron Egg’s face!

However, Sima Bei’s expression was ice-cold. He had just sent away Xiao Hai, and now such a person had appeared. Just how many top-notch martial artist were hidden in the South Province?

“Iron egg, kill him!”Qin Yu shouted at Iron Egg.

Iron egg sneered, “Don’t worry, I Will Never Show Mercy.”

After saying that, his feet shook, and the ground was instantly shattered. His body was like an arrow that had left the bowstring, and he once again shot towards Sima Bei!

Sima bei cursed inwardly. He didn’t have absolute confidence. He had never wanted to step into the South Province, and now that such a person had appeared, it was too dangerous for Sima Bei.

Therefore, he did not have any fighting spirit. He immediately rushed into the darkness and left quickly by relying on the teleportation formation! Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

In just an instant, he disappeared without a trace.

Iron Egg’s fist smashed the space into pieces, but he still could not touch a corner of Sima Bei’s clothes.

“Damn it, he ran away just like that?”Iron Egg could not help but curse.

“Won’t the fighting spirit in my entire body be wasted just like that?”

Qin Yu frowned slightly. This was a place that was difficult to deal with in the northern lands.

They could leave this place at any time. Even someone as powerful as Xiao Hai could not do anything to them.

Not far away, Yong Ji’s expression could not help but turn cold.

He looked at iron egg beside Qin Yu and sneered, “Qin Yu, you really have a lot of top-notch martial artist by your side. You’re really lucky.”

Qin Yu looked at Yong Ji coldly and said, “Yong Ji, why are you talking so much nonsense? Didn’t you want to fight with me? Don’t Leave!”
