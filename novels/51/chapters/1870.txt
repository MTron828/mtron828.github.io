1871 Iron Egg’s Appearance

Since they had left, Qin Yu had nothing to be afraid of.

As for the secret technique that he had told Chang Mang, it was naturally nonsense.

Any so-called secret technique would be useless against a Semi-Saint.

After hearing Qin Yu’s words, the old man was stunned. Then he said with a gloomy face, “Little bastard, you dare to trick me?”

“I’m playing with you, what can you do? Do you really think I’m afraid of you? Will you spare my life?” Qin Yu said with a smile.

“Shameless!” the old man said with a dark face, “You’re begging for mercy, but you’re still acting so righteous!”

“Cut the crap, old man,” Qin Yu said with a smile. “Today, either you die or I die!”

“Little bastard!”

The elder seemed to have been angered by Qin Yu. With a wave of his hand, a terrifying aura mixed with Holy Power rushed toward Qin Yu!

Of course, Qin Yu would not sit still and wait for death. With a loud shout, he clenched his fist and greeted the incoming attack with a bright golden light!

But unfortunately, in the face of such a huge gap in strength, Qin Yu really had no ability to resist.

In less than half a second, Qin Yu was directly sent flying, and blood flowed out of his mouth!

“As expected of the Semi-Saint realm. It’s really powerful…” Qin Yu murmured in a low voice.

“Ancestor, don’t talk nonsense with him. Quickly kill him. We can’t delay it, or else things will change!” Tong Lianyang hurriedly shouted.

The old man nodded slightly and slowly raised his hand. His old palm was facing Qin Yu, and a terrifying aura was gathering in his palm.

Qin Yu gritted his teeth. He wanted to resist, but under the pressure of this powerful aura, he felt extremely uncomfortable.

In addition to the injuries on his body, Qin Yu had no power to resist!

“I’m finished!” Qin Yu had a bad feeling!

He didn’t expect that the Tong family could summon such an expert in the Semi-Saint realm!

“Little bastard, go to hell!”

The old man roared and the terrifying aura in his hand pushed toward Qin Yu!

At this critical moment, a figure suddenly stood in front of Qin Yu!

He raised his hands, and a bright light exploded in his hands!

The collision of the two auras made him retreat a few steps, but it was not a big deal. Qin Yu also got some breathing space and hurriedly hid to the side.

“What?”

The old man frowned.

“There’s still someone else?” Tong Lianyang was also a little confused.

Qin Yu took a closer look and found that it was Iron Egg!

“What are you doing here, Iron Egg?” Qin Yu said in shock.

Iron Egg glanced at Qin Yu and said, “F*ck you, I’ve been here for a few days, waiting for you! I’m telling you, after I help you today, I won’t owe you anything anymore. We’ll go our separate ways in the future!”

Qin Yu was a little excited. He had thought that Iron Egg would not come, but he had come to the Tong family’s house in advance!

It seemed that although this kid was not bound by morality, he still did not want to owe others.

“Many thanks, but… Can you defeat this old bastard?” Qin Yu said with a frown.

Iron Egg glared at Qin Yu and said, “You know I can’t beat you, so hurry up and lend me your Saint Weapon!”

Qin Yu came back to his senses and quickly threw the magic ruler to Iron Egg.

After receiving the magic ruler, Iron Egg appeared much calmer.

He opened his mouth and revealed his signature treacherous smile.

“Old man, you’re a Semi-Saint, right?” Iron Egg said, grinning.

The old man felt that Iron Egg wasn’t simple. He clasped his hands behind his back and said, “Who are you? Why are you interfering in the Tong family’s affairs?”

“I’m willing! Cut the f*cking crap!” Iron Egg cursed.

“Don’t think that I’m afraid of you,” the old man snorted. “As long as you haven’t entered the Semi-Saint realm, you’re no match for me!

“Stop acting tough. Do you think I can’t tell? You’re already dead, so why are you still lingering here?” Iron Egg cursed.

“I guess you can only hold on for half an hour at most before you disappear, right?” Iron Egg said with a wide smile.

The old man’s face changed slightly when he heard this. It was obvious that Iron Egg had hit the nail on the head. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

He said in a deep voice, “Little friend, I don’t want to be your enemy. Why don’t you join my Tong family? My Tong family will definitely not mistreat you.”

Iron Egg looked at the old man coldly for half a second. Then, he grabbed his magic ruler and charged at the old man!

“Why the hell do you have so much nonsense to say?” Iron Egg was furious.

The old man hadn’t expected Iron Egg to suddenly attack, and he hurriedly raised his hand in response.

At this moment, Iron Egg shouted at Qin Yu, “Qin Yu, hurry up and get lost. Wait for me for half an hour!”

Qin Yu stood up in a hurry. He knew that it was useless to stay here, and he might be affected by the remaining power.

So, Qin Yu stood up in a hurry and dashed away.

Two hundred stars away, Chang Mang and the others were waiting there.

Everyone’s faces were filled with worry, and only Chang Mang, that fool, had a relaxed expression.

It wasn’t his fault. Chang Mang was a simple-minded person and believed Qin Yu’s words too much. He didn’t expect Qin Yu to let them escape on purpose.

...

Seeing Qin Yu, Jiu Xiao and the others hurried to meet him.

“How is it? is that old man dead?” Chang Mang said as he stepped forward.

“I don’t have that kind of ability,” Qin Yu said with a bitter smile.

“It’s fine,” the peak master said in a deep voice. “It’s good enough that we managed to escape. The Tong family can only revive that old ancestor once. We’ll just go again after that old man disappears.”

“No need.” Qin Yu shook his head and smiled. “One of my friends is fighting with him.”

“Your friend? What friend?” Jiu Xiao said with some doubt.

Qin Yu opened his mouth and was about to tell them about Iron Egg’s background.

However, on second thought, Iron Egg was a bloodthirsty person. If he told the Demon-slaying Peak, they might become their target.

“Oh, it’s nothing!” Qin Yu waved his hand and said, “He’s just a friend of mine.”

“He’s also a Semi-Saint?” The peak master said in surprise.

Qin Yu opened his mouth and did not know how to answer.

...

Qin Yu had no idea how strong Iron Egg was at the moment, and he wasn’t sure if he could defeat the old man.

“I don’t know, but… He should be fine, right?” Qin Yu said unconfidently.

Then, Qin Yu looked in the direction of the Tong family in the distance.

At this moment, the Tong family was filled with light and fighting continuously.

Even if they were very far away, they could still see it clearly. The aura that drifted over from time to time was even more frightening.

Qin Yu started to feel a little uncertain. If Iron Egg died in the Tong family, Qin Yu would feel guilty for the rest of his life.

“I don’t think so. With Iron Egg’s personality, he’ll definitely run away if things go south,” Qin Yu consoled himself in his heart.
