Chapter 1012: Chapter 1,012, Heavenly River Mystic Realm 

The remaining three heavenly tribulation were going to come together?

Furthermore, these three heavenly tribulation seemed to be stacking up?

Qin Yu’s expression changed drastically! This was something he had not expected at all!

“Oh no!”Qin Yu thought to himself that things were not looking good.

Looking at his incomplete body, Qin Yu had an ominous premonition in his heart!

“Rumble...”

The three heavenly tribulation were still stacking up, as if they would fall down at any moment!

Not far away, the expressions of pavilion master and Xiang Danqing were also not too good.

With such a scale of heavenly tribulation, any wisp of it could destroy one’s soul!

“This kid’s heavenly tribulation is even more terrifying than I imagined,”Xiang Danqing exclaimed in shock.

“As expected of that person’s son.”

“Kacha!”

Just as the two of them were discussing, the heavenly tribulation smashed down viciously!

“Heavenly Tribulation!”Qin Yu shouted loudly. In such a situation, he had no way out!

“Come on!”Qin Yu propped up his damaged body and raised both his hands. Golden Rays shot out explosively, intending to forcefully withstand this heavenly tribulation!

“Boom!”

Finally, the Heavenly Tribulation smashed down fiercely on Qin Yu’s body from high up in the sky!

In an instant, the area turned into a sea of lightning!

Everything within a few hundred meters was blue!

Rocks were destroyed, trees were broken, and even the river was instantly evaporated!

“Ah! !”

Qin Yu’s furious roar could be heard from the center of the Lightning!

Only his voice could be heard, but no one could see him!

Pavilion master and Xiang Danqing stared at the center of the Sea of lightning, their faces filled with worry!

“We must hold on...”pavilion master said in a low voice.

Although they were anxious, they couldn’t help at all.

Because such a scale of heavenly tribulation was definitely not something their bodies could withstand!

The Sea of lightning continued to spread, and in the blink of an eye, it covered a radius of nearly one thousand meters.

And the voice in the center of the Sea of lightning also became quieter and quieter. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“Will he be Alright?”Xiang Danqing said with a frown.

The pavilion master did not say a word. He only stared at the Sea of lightning.

No one dared to guarantee a heavenly tribulation of this scale.

Moreover, since ancient times, many people had died in the martial saint’s Heavenly Tribulation.

“I should have made more preparations back then.”The Pavilion Master could not help but blame himself.

If he had prepared a protective dharma artifact for Qin Yu earlier to resist this heavenly tribulation, he would not have had to suffer so much.

“Don’t worry. If he can endure it, his strength will be beyond imagination,”Xiang Danqing comforted him.

Pavilion master sighed slightly and said in a low voice, “This is the only way.”

In the Sea of lightning, Qin Yu’s body was almost torn apart.

Every inch of his flesh and bones was cracking.

His body was destroyed and then reassembled again. However, before he could reassemble successfully, he was destroyed again.

This process was extremely long, and the Pain Qin Yu had suffered was self-evident.

Fortunately, Qin Yu’s divine sense was strong enough. Under such pain, he could still maintain his consciousness and endure the pain.

“I will never fall...”Qin Yu gritted his teeth, and even his mouth was emitting traces of blue light.

Time slowly passed, but the sea of lightning showed no signs of disappearing.

Qin Yu forced himself to stand up. He didn’t dare to be negligent.

In the outside world, pavilion master and Xiang Danqing were even more shocked.

“It hasn’t stopped yet.”Xiang Danqing frowned. “Did something really happen to him?”

Pavilion master shook his head and said, “I can feel his internal Qi. This means that he is still alive.”

“To be able to survive such a heavenly tribulation is really shocking,”Xiang Danqing said in a low voice.

“Swoosh!”

At this moment, a figure suddenly shot over from not far away!

“Who is it!”Pavilion master and Xiang Danqing looked over at the same time!

They saw a man looking coldly in the direction of the heavenly tribulation.

“Martial saint’s Heavenly Tribulation,”the man said to himself.

Xiang Danqing frowned and asked, “Who are you? Why are you here?”

The man glanced at Xiang Danqing. Suddenly, he waved his hand and a ray of light shot over!

The terrifying qi energy directly sent Xiang Danqing flying!

“Is this person who is undergoing the Heavenly Tribulation Qin Yu?”The man asked coldly.

Pavilion master frowned slightly.

She could not see through this person’s strength. This was enough to prove that his strength was far above hers.

“Martial Saint?”Pavilion master thought to herself that things were not looking good.

Then, pavilion master walked forward and said with a slight bow, “We have no intention to disturb you. We are only using this place. We are willing to bear all the losses.”

“Let me ask you, the person transcending the tribulation is Qin Yu!”That man ignored pavilion master’s words and directly shouted!

Pavilion master’s expression wasn’t too good.

From his tone, this person was most likely coming for Qin Yu.

“No.”Thinking of this, pavilion master immediately shook his head.

“No? You Dare to lie to me?”This man’s expression was incomparably cold.

Then, with his hands behind his back, he walked towards pavilion master’s direction.

“Swish!”

Just as he approached, he suddenly stretched out his hand and grabbed pavilion master’s forehead!

Then, a strand of divine sense entered and began to forcibly search his soul!

Pavilion Master’s expression was incomparably ugly. She wanted to struggle, but found that she couldn’t break free at all!

“HMPH, it really is that Qin Yu.”The man sneered, then threw pavilion master to the side.

Then, the man looked at lei hai and sneered, “It really didn’t take much effort to come here, to actually let me meet him here.”

“Who exactly are you!”Pavilion master stood up and blocked in front of him.

This man raised his eyebrows and laughed coldly, “A mayfly trying to shake a tree, a mantis trying to stop a chariot. Do You Want to Die?”

Pavilion master’s expression was ice cold as he said, “Although I am not your match, I will definitely not let you do whatever you want.”

“Hahahaha!”This man immediately laughed loudly.

“Pavilion Master of the Medicine God’s Pavilion, Alright, I will tell you who I am.”

“I am Li Zi Qi from the Heavenly River Mystic Realm!”

Pavilion master’s brows were tightly knitted together and she did not say a word.

She had never heard of any Heavenly River mystic realm and she had never heard of any Li Zi Qi.

But now that all the mystic realms wanted to get rid of Qin Yu, she was no longer surprised.

“In the fire country, I really do not dare to kill you. But here, I can take your life at any time.”Li Zi Qi said with his eyes narrowed.

The pavilion master did not say a word, but his entire body was emitting streams of purple flames.
