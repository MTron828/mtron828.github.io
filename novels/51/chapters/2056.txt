2057 The Holy Lord of the Si Family Arrives

“Astral Mountain…” Qin Yu murmured. Being in the Holy Region for many years, Qin Yu naturally knew about Astral Mountain.

Back then, many chosen ones departed from Astral Mountain to explore the starry sky to comprehend the dao. However, the outcome was not satisfactory.

From then on, cultivators below the True Saint cultivation realm would never depart from Astral Mountain again. As time passed, this place was almost deserted.

Now that the Golden Age had arrived, perhaps Astral Mountain would be reactivated.

Apart from leaving the Holy Region, one could also enter the Holy Region through Astral Mountain. Rumor had it that many years ago, visitors from the outer region often appeared in Astral Mountain.

!!

Qin Yu moved upward and went up to Astral Mountain.

Astral Mountain had been overcrowded at this moment, but it was enough to accommodate countless cultivators.

There were also people hiding in the void, silently watching everything.

Qin Yu sensed the internal qi around him using a weak divine sense.

Soon, he detected much powerful internal qi hidden around Astral Mountain. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Most of the internal qi did not come from the nine great aristocratic families but from some powerful rogue cultivators.

To seize the opportunities in the Chaos Grave, they had come out to take a look at the secrets of Astral Mountain.

Qin Yu simply concealed his internal qi and stopped at a place without people, waiting for the grand event to begin.

Astral Mountain, at this moment, was surrounded by clouds and mist, and a celestial aura gathered. The dazzling starry sky in the sky seemed to be very close, and one could pluck the stars with a raise of hands.

Many cultivators gathered and toasted each other. They had the intention of gathering and also harboring evil thoughts.

Qin Yu closed his eyes slightly and did not say a word. He did not want to blend in with anyone.

Soon, people from various aristocratic families began to descend. Extremely enormous and luxurious carriages appeared in the sky, one after another!

The carriage was magnificent, symbolizing their noble status.

Every aristocratic family seemed to have mobilized numerous troops. There were even several carriages.

“Did you see that? Rumor has it that those carriages can travel through the starry sky.”

“That’s right. The leading rusty carriage had once crossed the void and headed to other planets.”

“The nine great aristocratic families have many years of foundation, allowing their cultivators a higher starting point. It’s good enough if we can get a share of it.”

Everyone sighed with emotions, and the envy in their eyes could not be concealed.

“Look, the Holy Lord of the Si family is here!” someone exclaimed at this moment.

Looking up, a tall and sturdy man stood on the deck of an enormous carriage, coldly glancing at the area.

He had an imposing aura that made people shudder even from afar.

A trace of coldness flashed across Qin Yu’s face, and a trace of killing intent even emerged.

Only this Holy Lord could open the Skywater Prison of the Si family. In other words, only he could save Chang Mang.

However, the current Qin Yu had no chance of winning at all. He could only stand in the distance and stare at him coldly.

“I didn’t expect the Holy Lord to come personally.”

“It seems the Si family attaches particular importance to this Chaos Grave.”

“You talk nonsense! That’s Wu Ji’s Chaos Grave! What does the hidden treasure mean to Si Shiyue? It’s a chaotic body!”

“Qin Yu is also a chaotic body. I wonder if he dares to come.”

Now that the Chaos Grave had appeared. Qin Yu had become the center of attention. Whenever they mentioned Si Shiyue, they would mention Qin Yu.

Qin Yu shrank his neck, his eyes staring coldly in front.

As long as he obtained the Traceless Immortal Scripture, he would not care about any bullsh*t Holy Lord.

“This Holy Lord doesn’t seem to be in the True Saint cultivation realm,” Qin Yu whispered.

At this moment, a cultivator beside him said, “True Saint? Do you think True Saints are Tom, Dick, and Harry?”

Qin Yu was shocked. He looked at the cultivator and said, “Could it be that the nine great aristocratic families don’t have True Saint at all?”

“Of course not. The nine great aristocratic families naturally have True Saints overseeing them, but they might not be the Holy Lords. They are most likely the Supreme Elders of the nine great aristocratic families and will only take action at critical moments,” the cultivator said.

“But now that the Golden Age has arrived. I’m afraid many people will become True Saints. For example, Si Liuhe of the Si family, Yan Guyun of the Yan family, and so on.”

Qin Yu looked around and realized Si Liuhe and Yan Guyun were not there.

“Is Si Liuhe in closed-door cultivation?” Qin Yu frowned.

“Rumor has it that they’re trying to break through to the True Saint cultivation realm,” the cultivator beside him said. “If they step into the True Sant cultivation realm, their strength will be even more terrifying than the veteran True Saint.”

Qin Yu was silent, but he was tremendously shocked in his heart.

It would be incredibly terrifying if they stepped into the True Saint cultivation realm!

Qin Yu could still escape now or at least conceal his internal qi.

However, if he were to face a True Saint, all magical artifacts would be useless, and he would be instantly detected. He would have nowhere to hide.

“Hmm? Aren’t you Qin Yu?” At this moment, the cultivator seemed to have recognized Qin Yu and immediately exclaimed.

Qin Yu’s expression changed. He hurriedly covered his face and said, “What nonsense are you talking about? I’m not. I’ll sue you for slander!”

“Quickly come and see. That Qin Yu is indeed here!” However, this cultivator was a big mouth and immediately began to shout.

Countless people surrounded Qin Yu in an instant. They surrounded him as if they were interviewing a celebrity.

“Qin Yu, are you here for the Chaos Grave too?”

“I didn’t expect you to not give up! All the aristocratic families want to kill you now, and you still dare to come? How dare you!”

“If you get the Chaos Grave, do you have any hope of surpassing Si Shiyue?”

One question after another kept drilling into Qin Yu’s ears, causing Qin Yu to have a headache.

It was probably impossible to hide his identity now.

Thinking of this, Qin Yu admitted frankly, “That’s right, I’m Qin Yu. As for the questions you asked, I won’t answer them at all. Don’t ask me anymore!”

In the dark, a cultivator looked in Qin Yu’s direction and said indifferently, “Qin Yu really came! It looks like the temptation of the Chaos Grave is indeed great.”

“Even someone like you, who has been in seclusion for a thousand years, came for the Chaos Grave, let alone the chaotic body.”

“I’m afraid he can’t escape from death today.”

In the distance, people from various aristocratic families also soon noticed Qin Yu.

“Holy Lord, Qin Yu has also arrived,” a cultivator of the Si family half-knelt in front of the Holy Lord of the Si family and said in a low voice.

Hearing this, the Holy Lord casually glanced in Qin Yu’s direction.

“That person is Qin Yu? He looks ordinary,” the Holy Lord said indifferently.

“Holy Lord Si, Qin Yu looks simple, but he’s not. Not long ago, he killed an elder of the Si family with his abilities.” An elderly man walked over with steady steps.
