Chapter 1532: Chapter 1,532: stepping into the level of a mighty figure 1

The Earth was shrouded in darkness, and the Sun could not be seen.

The sky was like an angry face, causing people to feel fear.

In the midst of the Heavenly Tribulation, Qin Yu was engaged in a life-and-death battle with his father, the Dao-guardian.

Each and every dao-guardian was a heaven’s chosen, and their talent was unmatched. Even Qin Yu felt more and more apprehensive as he fought.

Even if he used all of his trump cards, he wouldn’t be able to do anything to the Guardian.

His strength far exceeded Qin Yu’s imagination!

“This won’t do. If this drags on, I’m afraid I’ll be defeated here.”Qin Yu’s expression was a bit grim.

Qin Yu was already injured, and after the battle, his internal Qi became even more chaotic.

On the other hand, the guardian was only a manifestation of the heavenly tribulation. He didn’t even need his internal Qi to support him.

This was extremely disadvantageous for Qin Yu.

Just as Qin Yu was thinking, the Guardian had already closed in once again!

He still used the simplest and most efficient move, relying on his crushing fist!

Qin Yu naturally did not dare to be negligent. He could only engage in a second battle with him.

......

The battle between the two of them could be said to be earth-shattering. If not for the Heavenly Tribulation, the falling life valley would have already been reduced to ruins!

Finally, Qin Yu’s internal Qi began to wither. Faced with the powerful attacks of the Guardian, he began to retreat.

From the beginning of the battle to the end, Qin Yu could only passively defend.

Under such circumstances, although Qin Yu’s pressure was doubled, he did not lose his footing. Instead, he retreated while looking for flaws.

In the blink of an eye, Qin Yu was already being pushed back. However, the Guardian’s attacks could be said to be perfect. He could not find any flaws to exploit!

“Father, you have really given me a difficult problem...”Qin Yu smiled bitterly.

As he was speaking, the Guardian’s fist had already landed on Qin Yu’s chest.

The power of this punch was beyond imagination. Qin Yu’s powerful physical body was actually directly penetrated, and a mouthful of blood gushed out!

The Guardian’s fist had almost touched Qin Yu’s chest!

“How is this possible!”This made Qin Yu’s expression change greatly!

Among the same level, Qin Yu’s physical body had never been defeated by anyone!

But now, the Fist of the Guardian actually directly penetrated Qin Yu’s physical body!

“As expected of the Guardian...”Qin Yu lowered his head to look at the bloody hole in his chest, and his expression became more and more serious.

And the Guardian not far away was like an emotionless killing machine, extremely cold.

“It seems that dodging isn’t the way...”Qin Yu got up from the ground and muttered.

Dodging was also death. Rather than doing so, it was better to fight.

Qin Yu took a deep breath and tried his best to adjust his internal QI. His golden fist once again shone brightly.

This punch was still the ten thousand spell breaking punch. This punch was created by Qin Yu himself, and was not inherited from the Guardian.

“I’ll go all out.”Qin Yu cursed inwardly. Then, he raised his hand and used the ten thousand spell breaking punch to charge at the Guardian!

The Guardian looked coldly at Qin Yu. He clenched his fist and also charged at Qin Yu!

This time, Qin Yu did not Dodge. Instead, he planned to use his life-or-death fighting style to seek a chance of survival for himself!

“Ah! ! !”

Qin Yu’s roar shook the heaven and earth. The Golden Light of the ten thousand spell breaking punch also ruthlessly smashed toward the Guardian’s chest!

At the same time, The Guardian’s fist also landed on Qin Yu’s chest!

“Boom!”

The Guardian’s fist was the first to smash into Qin Yu’s body.

However, what shocked Qin Yu was that this punch seemed majestic, but when it landed on his body, it actually didn’t have the slightest bit of power to speak of. Instead, it was as if it had touched his body!

Qin Yu’s eyes widened as he hurriedly looked at the Guardian. In between them, the Guardian’s figure was slowly dissipating.

A gratified smile appeared on the corner of his mouth.

Although the smile was fleeting, it still did not escape Qin Yu’s eyes!

Qin Yu hurriedly rubbed his eyes and looked at the corner of the Guardian’s mouth again.

The Guardian’s face returned to its icy cold expression, causing people to suspect that the smile just now was a blur.

“What... What’s going on...”Qin Yu’s face was filled with shock!

He looked at his father, who was slowly disappearing, and could not help but take two steps back.

Wasn’t that shadow formed from the Heavenly Tribulation? Why was he smiling?

Also, that punch was clearly enough to take Qin Yu’s life. Why was it powerless when it landed on his body?

Could it be that this shadow of his father had his own divine sense? Could it be his father’s original body?

That was absolutely impossible!

However, he had to admit that the Dao-guardian had gone easy on him. He had intentionally allowed Qin Yu to defeat him.

“I can’t figure it out...”Qin Yu murmured softly. Countless questions lingered in his mind.

If the dao-guardian had not gone easy on him, even if Qin Yu had won by a fluke, he would have been heavily injured.

“Father...”Qin Yu muttered this name in a low voice. He could not help but look up into the sky.

The dark clouds in the sky seemed to be dissipating. His father’s figure had long disappeared without a trace.

There were too many mysteries in this world that a small character like Qin Yu couldn’t understand.

He took a deep breath and stopped thinking about it.

No matter what, this heavenly tribulation could be considered to have been successfully passed.

Qin Yu sat cross-legged on the ground. Streams of internal Qi lingered around his body. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

The injuries on his body were rapidly recovering, and his internal Qi was also rising.

This was the sign of stepping into the mighty realm. Golden light blossomed and shot through the layers of dark clouds in the sky!

Qin Yu’s body became golden, and even his hair turned golden yellow!

In the blink of an eye, his body and spiritual power had improved qualitatively, but this was not the end. Instead, it was just the beginning.

His internal Qi was still rising rapidly. A powerful pressure was emitted from his body.

“Rumble...”

The Falling Life Valley seemed to be unable to bear it anymore. It began to emit a loud rumble.

Crushed Stones fell from the sky. In a short moment, this place had already turned into ruins!

Sima bei, who was not far away, also noticed this strange phenomenon.

He hurriedly looked in the direction of Qin Yu and said in a low voice, “This internal Qi... is from Qin Yu’s body?”

This internal Qi was too powerful, so powerful that it made one’s heart palpitate!

Even Sima Bei couldn’t help but feel afraid!

“How is this possible? How could his body emit such an internal Qi!”Sima bei’s expression changed drastically!

He shattered the chains and quickly walked towards Zhuo Jing.

Zhuo Jing no longer had any strength to resist. Facing Sima Bei, it was as if life and death depended on fate.

Sima bei grabbed Zhuo Jing, but he still felt waves of fear in his heart.

“Could it be that the people of the three maniacs and three uniques are here?”Sima bei said in a low voice.

He simply couldn’t believe that this internal Qi came from the Qin Yu who had broken through!

Right at this moment, the ruins suddenly exploded! A golden figure exploded!

He broke through all the obstacles, and like a golden bolt of lightning, he leaped all the way into the air!
