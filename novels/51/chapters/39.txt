Chapter 40: Make the Shen Family Bankrupt! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Qin Yu’s words were so compelling that even the white-haired young man couldn’t help but look over.

Shen Yun laughed in anger as he pointed at Qin Yu and said, “Well, well! I never thought there would be someone who would dare to talk to me like this in such a little place like Jiangcheng!”

After saying that, Shen Yun threw the stick at Qin Yu’s feet.

”I’ll give you a chance to break your own legs and I’ll let this slide,” Shen Yun said in a cold voice.

Qin Yu glanced at the stick at his feet, and then kicked it violently.

The stick flew towards Shen Yun with a whoosh.

The stick grazed Shen Yun’s head and pierced the wall behind him.

The wall immediately broke and cracks like spider webs appeared. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Shen Yun’s expression grew increasingly cold as he said with a sneer, “I’ve given you a chance, and since you don’t cherish it, don’t blame me for being merciless.”

”Starting from tomorrow, all the people close to you will suffer!” Shen Yun’s expression was ruthless.

Qin Yu didn’t know many people and was practically a lone wolf.

Therefore, he wasn’t intimidated by Shen Yun’s warning.

”You can scram now,” Shen Yun waved his hand and said.

Qin Yu, however, stood there without moving.

Shen Yun frowned and rebuked, “I told you to get lost. Didn’t you hear me?”

Qin Yu paid no attention to Shen Yun, and instead looked at the white-haired young man and said, “Would you like to come with me?”

The white-haired young man couldn’t help but freeze as he stared blankly at Qin Yu in disbelief.

”As a grown man, how can you live such a subservient life? Are you willing to stay as a dog by the side of such people, or do you want to live with dignity for the rest of your life?” Qin Yu asked in a cold voice.

The white-haired young man did not say anything as he lowered his head, and a conflicted look appeared on his face.

Shen Yun, who was quite amused, kicked the white-haired young man and said, “A dog is a dog and has no chance of becoming a human being.”

At that moment, the white-haired young man suddenly rose from the ground!

He gritted his teeth as he said, “Shen Yun, I’ve had enough of you!”

”When you face people who are more powerful than you, you kiss up to them. When you face less powerful people, you don’t even treat them like human beings! I quit!”

After saying that, the white-haired young man furiously threw the suit he was wearing on the ground and approached Qin Yu.

Shen Yun’s expression was cold and he waved his hand at once. His bodyguard instantly understood and grabbed a knife to stab the white-haired young man in the back!

Just as the knife was about to strike the white-haired young man, Qin Yu flicked his finger and the bodyguard’s wrist was struck hard by something! The knife fell as well!

He turned his head and saw that it was a coin!

”Let’s go.” Qin Yu looked at the white-haired young man and supported him as he walked out of the hotel.

Shen Yun’s expression was grim and he flipped the table over!

”I will never let him off!” A vicious look appeared on Shen Yun’s face.

...

Qin Yu took the white-haired young man back to his residence.

After a short conversation, Qin Yu learned that the white-haired young man’s name was Yao Qing, a bodyguard hired by Shen Yun at great expense.

”Thank you for saving my life twice, but unfortunately, I am now a cripple. I’m afraid I can’t repay you.” Yao Qing sat beside Qin Yu and appeared despondent.

Qin Yu gave him a look and took out a pill.

”Take this,” said Qin Yu indifferently.

Yao Qing froze and said with a frown, “What is this?”

”Take it before you ask.” Qin Yu didn’t provide any explanation.

When Yao Qing heard this, he didn’t say anything further and immediately swallowed the pill.

This pill was the Marrow Pill that Qin Yu had refined.

He had planned to give it to Shen Yun as compensation, but after seeing Shen Yun’s disgusting attitude, Qin Yu changed his mind.

The moment the Marrow Pill entered his belly, Qin Yu reached out his hand and placed it on Shen Yun’s kneecap, and a surge of spiritual energy covered his palm.

Yao Qing felt a burst of soreness and itchiness at his knee, and the feeling was incredibly bizarre.

Half a minute later, Qin Yu removed his hand.

”Try taking a couple of steps,” said Qin Yu nonchalantly.

Yao Qing attempted to move his arms and legs, and then, to his surprise, he found that his broken leg had healed!

”This... How is this possible?” Yao Qing was astonished!

”Even the world’s best doctors don’t have the skills to do this...” Yao Qing was amazed.

But Qin Yu said with a light smile, “The world’s best doctors can’t be compared to me.”

He wasn’t bluffing but was telling the truth.

After getting the cultivation method, Qin Yu had reached the ultimate level. He could even break the stars with one punch and raise the dead.

”Okay, I’m going to ask you a few questions now.” At this point, Qin Yu glanced at Yao Qing.

Yao Qing hurriedly said, “I won’t forget the kindness you have shown me, so if you have any questions, just ask!”

Qin Yu’s eyes flashed with coldness.

”I need you to reveal to me everything about the Shen family, including their business, assets, and capabilities,” Qin Yu said in a cold voice.

”I want the Shen family to lose everything.” Qin Yu’s voice, resolute and cold, was unwavering.

Qin Yu wanted to ask Yao Qing a lot of questions, but right now, what Qin Yu wanted to do most was to make the Shen family bankrupt!
