The internal qi came from Gu Canghai, Elder Qu, and He Teng.

Along the way, Elder Qu was a little nervous.

He was afraid that Gu Canghai would sell him out.

He Teng, on the other hand, was silent.

He used to be known as the number one person in the Central Plains, but now, he seemed to be someone else’s background.

Whenever He Teng was mentioned, people no longer referred to the number one person in the Central Plains, but “The half-step Martial Marquis who was defeated by a peak Inner Strength Grandmaster”.

When he thought of this, He Teng couldn’t help but clench his fists. He wished he could kill Qin Yu with his own hands.

The car soon arrived at the entrance of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion.

Gu Canghai wasn’t in a hurry to get out of the car.

He looked coldly at the Divine Alchemist Pavilion and snorted coldly inside. “This is the last time. If you dare to appear, I will definitely kill you!”

After that, Gu Canghai got down from the car, followed closely by Elder Qu and He Teng.

The three of them strode into the Divine Alchemist Pavilion.

Their appearance immediately attracted the attention of several people.

Qin Yu, who was sitting in the Elder’s residence, suddenly opened his eyes.

“Gu Canghai is here.” Qin Yu stood up from the bed and strode towards the square.

On the square, many people stood in the distance and watched Gu Canghai.

“You’re here again!” The Fifth Elder glared at Elder Qu and said coldly.

Elder Qu snorted, “So what if I come?”

The Fifth Elder berated loudly, “The Pavilion Master has already returned. You have no right to come to the Divine Alchemist Pavilion. Get out!”

Elder Qu narrowed his eyes and sneered. “An ant dares to cross me? You’re too brazen!”

With that said, Elder Qu’s palm suddenly reached out towards Fifth Elder!

A terrifying qi force immediately pressed towards the Fifth Elder!

The Fifth Elder’s expression changed drastically. He was only an Inner Strength Grandmaster and had no strength to resist!

At this critical moment, a huge golden hand reached out!

“Boom!”

The huge golden hand slapped out.

The huge force immediately caused Elder Qu to feel a trace of backlash.

Bang! He took a few steps back, and a trace of blood oozed out of his mouth.

“Are you here to negotiate peace with the Divine Alchemist Pavilion, or are you here to cause trouble?” Qin Yu looked coldly at Gu Canghai.

Gu Canghai’s expression was ice-cold, and he didn’t speak for a long time.

He Teng, who was at the side, couldn’t help but clench his fists.

He couldn’t suppress the murderous internal qi inside. The target was naturally Qin Yu.

“Do you want to kill me?” Qin Yu caught this trace of murderous internal qi and then looked at He Teng.

He Teng snorted coldly and didn’t speak.

“Qin Yu! Don’t be too arrogant!” Elder Qu shouted loudly.

“The sect master of the Saint Confucian Sect is here. You don’t have the right to act cocky!”

Qin Yu glanced at Elder Qu and snickered. “You’re just trash. If you dare to talk nonsense again, I don’t mind killing you.”

“You... You!” Elder Qu, his face red with anger, stammered.

At this moment, Gu Canghai, who had been silent all this time, finally spoke.

“He’s trash, but what about me?” Gu Canghai said coldly.

“The same goes for you.”

At this moment, a clear and cold voice came from afar.

Following that, the Pavilion Master walked over.

“Pavilion Master!”

The instant they saw the Pavilion Master, everyone in the Divine Alchemist Pavilion bowed.

Gu Canghai’s expression lit up with a trace of playfulness. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“Ji Yuhong, you have to thank this kid called Qin Yu for you to be able to return,” Gu Canghai said indifferently.

“I really didn’t expect that the Grand Pavilion Master of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion would have to rely on a junior to come back safely.”

The Pavilion Master wasn’t angry about this. Instead, she said with a nonchalant smile, “That’s still much better than you relying on the Yan family to get to where you are today.”

Gu Canghai’s expression darkened. He snorted coldly and said, “Ji Yuhong! I’ll spare your life on account of the fact that you and I used to be old friends, but you’d better not interfere today!”

“Old friends?” A trace of surprise flashed across the Pavilion Master’s expression.

“When did I have an old friend like you? I only remember that you once knelt in front of me and begged me not to kill you.”

As soon as these words were said, everyone present was shocked!

No one had expected that there would be such a history between the two!

And Gu Canghai’s expression was extremely unsightly!

He gritted his teeth and braced himself to say, “Nonsense! I’m a dignified Martial Marquis, so how could I kneel to a woman like you?!”

“Is that so?” A nonchalant smile appeared on the Pavilion Master’s expression.

“You can deny your past words and deeds, but can you deny the infirmity of your body?”

infirmity of the body?

Everyone was stunned. Gu Canghai actually had an infirmity of the body?

A trace of panic flashed across Gu Canghai’s face. He hurriedly berated, “Shut up!”

After that, Gu Canghai changed the topic, “Qin Yu killed my disciple, destroyed my mountain gate, and caused the Saint Confucian Sect to suffer heavy losses! No one can protect him today!”

Qin Yu said coldly, “It seems that Sect Master Gu intends to go back on his word for the second time.”

Gu Canghai sneered. “Go back on MY word? Do you really think that I agreed to it?!”

“Saint Confucian... these two words are really ironic,” Qin Yu sneered.

“Just now, the Pavilion Master said that your body is infirmity. Can it be that you’re inpotent in that aspect?”

“Fair enough. It’s fortunate that a beast like you has an infirmity. Otherwise, if you were to give birth to an heir, I’m afraid that he would also be a scourge.”

When he heard Qin Yu’s words, Gu Canghai’s expression suddenly changed!

He subconsciously looked at Ji Yuhong! Gritting his teeth, he said, “You actually told him!”

Ji Yuhong raised her eyebrows and said, “I didn’t say anything.”

Gu Canghai’s expression suddenly changed!

Oh no, wasn’t this equivalent to admitting it?

“Old beast, you’re really impotent?” Qin Yu said in surprise.

“Then why didn’t you say so earlier? Hurry up and beg our Pavilion Master, and perhaps we can refine a tonic for you!”

“Ah!!!” Gu Canghai raised his head and roared angrily!

“Little b*stard, even the king himself can’t save you today!”

After saying that, Gu Canghai stretched out his big palm and summoned his inner strength!

The Pavilion Master’s expression turned cold, and she said in a low voice, “Gu Canghai, you have repeatedly provoked me. I have already shown you enough mercy.”

“Hehe, you’re only a half-step Martial Marquis. What do you mean? I want to see how you’re going to stop me today!” Gu Canghai roared angrily.

The Pavilion Master didn’t say anything. She raised her smooth hand and confronted him.
