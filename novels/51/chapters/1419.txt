Chapter 1420: Chapter 1,420, Treasure Sword Silver Spring 1

He Teng was an extremely evil fellow. His wickedness could be said to be pure.

Falling into his hands would be more terrifying than falling into anyone’s hands.

Qin Yu sat there. After a long time, his mood gradually calmed down.

His back and hair were already drenched. His face was also covered in sweat.

“Fortunately, no matter what, I can be considered to have escaped a calamity,”Qin Yu thought to himself.

Although he teng had come for this body, no matter what, the result he brought was still good.

At least, Qin Yu had already escaped the Heavenly Cloud sect.

“Damn, what should I do with the chains on my body?”Qin Yu couldn’t help but feel worried.

This was personally arranged by the sect master, so Qin Yu had no way to break it.

And this area was in the wilderness. It was simply too difficult to wait for a person to come.

Qin Yu tried to struggle, but he found that he could not break free at all.

“Am I going to be trapped here and die?”Qin Yu frowned.

He Teng, this dog, had thrown him into such a place. It was simply impossible for him to break free.

The sky gradually darkened. Qin Yu tried countless methods, but he was unable to break free.

Soon, Qin Yu felt a wave of fatigue.

After experiencing fear, people would usually be extremely tired, and Qin Yu was no exception.

He lay on the ground, thinking of resting for a while, but not long after, he fell asleep.

On the other side.

The entire Heavenly Cloud sect was in an uproar, and everyone present cried out in alarm.

“Who Saved Qin Yu?”

“What a powerful technique. Even the heavenly cloud sect couldn’t catch up.”

“What kind of technique was that? It disappeared without a trace in the blink of an eye!”

The first Elder’s face was ashen, and he felt somewhat guilty in his heart.

He looked at the sect master by the side, cupped his hands, and said, “Sect master, this matter is my fault. If it wasn’t for my repeated failures, Qin Yu wouldn’t have been able to escape...”

The sect master was rather calm. He even felt relieved in his heart.

It was as if a huge weight had been lifted from his heart.

“It doesn’t matter. This is fate.”After a long while, the sect master slowly spoke.

The first elder hurriedly said, “Sect master, I will definitely compensate you. Definitely! Don’t worry, I will immediately send people to capture him!”

The sect master waved his hand and said, “Rest first.”

The great elder felt extremely guilty. Because of this matter, his prestige had plummeted.

It was not easy to capture Qin Yu, but he had escaped again.

“Qin Yu... I will definitely capture you personally!”The Great Elder clenched his fists and said through gritted teeth.

...

When Qin Yu woke up, it was already the second day.

The surroundings were still desolate, and the chains on his body had not disappeared.

“No, I can’t just sit here and wait for death.”The more Qin Yu thought about it, the angrier he became.

He simply wriggled his body and crawled forward.

This was naturally an extremely difficult process, because the speed was too slow.

In an entire day, Qin Yu had only crawled for a few weeks.

The surroundings were still desolate, and there was no one around.

“No, I have to continue crawling.”Qin Yu gritted his teeth and continued to crawl forward.

For five days and five nights, Qin Yu did not stop.

He had to admire Qin Yu’s ability to survive. By crawling, he managed to crawl out for dozens of stars.

However, Qin Yu was also extremely tired.

He fell to the ground and soon fell asleep. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

After an unknown amount of time, when Qin Yu woke up, he was already lying on the bed.

He slowly opened his eyes and was surrounded by luxurious wooden decorations.

A fragrant aroma assaulted his nostrils.

Qin Yu tried to get up, but due to the restraints of the chains, he was unable to struggle free.

Soon, he heard Qin Yu’s movements from outside.

In a short moment, a young man walked in.

“Brother Qin, you’re Awake?”The young man said with a smile.

Seeing this young man, Qin Yu immediately turned pale with fright.

“Zhuo Jing?”Qin Yu frowned and immediately felt a strong sense of vigilance in his heart.

Zhuo Jing walked to Qin Yu’s side and sat down. He said with a smile, “I just happened to be out and passed by the West Encounter Peak. I met you and brought you back.”

Qin Yu still didn’t let down her guard. She said with a face full of doubt, “What a coincidence!”

Zhuo Jing seemed to have seen through Qin Yu’s thoughts. He said with a smile, “Brother Qin, you have been in a coma for three days. If I wanted to tell the Heavenly Cloud sect, I would have informed them long ago. Why wait until now?”

Qin Yu slightly let out a sigh of relief. He said in a deep voice, “Aren’t you afraid that the people of the Heavenly Cloud sect will come to find you?”

“As long as I don’t say it and you don’t say it, who will know that you are here?”Zhuo Jing said.

Qin Yu said with some confusion, “But why did you save me? You should know that you will offend the Heavenly Cloud Sect...”

Zhuo Jing thought for a moment and said, “A person’s good luck can happen once or twice, but if there is always good luck, then you can’t use luck to measure it.”

“Brother Qin, you’ve been able to escape from the Heavenly Cloud sect many times. This is enough to prove your ability. This is the golden age. The slightest carelessness can result in death. Everyone should report to the group for warmth.”

What Zhuo Jing said made sense, but Qin Yu didn’t dare to believe him.

“Brother Qin, wait for me for a moment,”Zhuo Jing said.

With that, he turned around and walked out.

About half an hour later, Zhuo Jing returned to the room once again.

This time, he was holding a treasure sword in his hand. The treasure sword flickered with a sparkling radiance, and it also emitted an aged aura.

Obviously, this treasure sword was not ordinary.

“This is a treasure sword left behind by my father. It’s called the Silver Spring, and it’s said to be able to cut through everything in the world. And my father is at the return to void stage,”Zhuo Jing said.

Qin Yu was immediately shocked.

Return to void realm? According to Qin Yu’s knowledge, there shouldn’t be a return to void realm in the entire Southern Region, right?

Even the sect master of the Heavenly Cloud Sect, the legend of the three lunatics and three absolutes, probably hadn’t stepped into this realm.

“Weng!”

At this moment, the Silver Spring in Zhuo Jing’s hand came out of his body, and a voice that sounded like a dragon’s roar was heard.

Qin Yu’s heart tightened, and he said warily, “What are you doing?”

Zhuo Jing didn’t say anything. He held the sword and walked toward Qin Yu.

He raised the sword and swung it down. A dazzling light cut through the void and came toward Qin Yu.
