1812 You Can Go to Zhongzhou Now

The power of Jiu Xiao was far beyond imagination! With the suppression of the cultivation realm, Qin Yu was almost unable to fight back.

A shake of his hand directly threw Qin Yu out.

The strong force smashed Qin Yu into the wall straight away.

Before Qin Yu could get up, Jiu Xiao raised his palm, and a ray of light pressed down, smashing Qin Yu into the ground!

Jiu Xiao showed no mercy. The huge difference in strength between the two made Qin Yu fall to the ground, unable to move.

“Get lost,” he said, looking at Qin Yu coldly.

Qin Yu, lying on the ground, gritted his teeth and clenched his fists tightly. He tried his best to get up again.

However, with the injuries on his body, he couldn’t stand up at all!

Jiu Xiao was too lazy to respond to Qin Yu. He sat there with his eyes slightly closed as if he was comprehending the dao of the Immortal Emperor in Thunder Courtyard.

Just when Jiu Xiao thought Qin Yu had given up, he stood up again and rushed toward Jiu Xiao!

“Eh?” Jiu Xiao frowned slightly. Even he was shocked by Qin Yu’s surging combat power!

The golden radiance was like the sunlight piercing through the darkness, shooting straight toward Jiu Xiao!

Jiu Xiao snorted coldly. With a wave of his sleeve, 36 rays of terrifying light instantly emitted from his sleeve, each containing a different power!

“Boom!”

At the instant of collision, Qin Yu’s golden light was shattered directly.

But to Jiu Xiao’s surprise, Qin Yu took this opportunity to step the line word formula and was already close to him!

Holding the Ten Thousand Spell Breaking Punch in his hand, all the power seemed to have been gathered on this fist!

At such a close distance, even Jiu Xiao could not avoid it.

“Boom!”

This punch landed on Jiu Xiao’s chest!

No matter how strong Jiu Xiao was, he only had a mortal body.

Under this punch, he was instantly sent flying, and several of his ribs were broken!

“It seems you’re not invincible…” Qin Yu grinned. Blood stained his white teeth, making him look extremely crazy.

Jiu Xiao’s expression was extremely cold. He looked at Qin Yu and said, “You reckless fool! Since that’s the case, I don’t mind sending you off!”

This time, Jiu Xiao did not hide anything. He disclosed his terrifying techniques one by one to Qin Yu.

Facing the serious Jiu Xiao, Qin Yu did not have the strength to fight back. Despite the use of the fighting word character, he still could not be compared with him.

In less than ten minutes, Qin Yu had been knocked down three times.

But every time, Qin Yu would stand up stubbornly.

Even though his body was covered in wounds, he still had no intention of giving up!

Looking at Qin Yu’s staggering body, Jiu Xiao was moved.

“What a stubborn fellow,” Jiu Xiao said coldly.

“Give up now. You no longer have the ability to fight.”

Qin Yu’s body swayed as he walked to Jiu Xiao with difficulty.

“Unless you kill me, otherwise… I will never admit defeat…”

After saying that, Qin Yu raised his fist and waved it at Jiu Xiao.

However, this punch was weak and powerless. Jiu Xiao did not dodge, allowing this bloody fist to dye his white clothes red.

In the next second, Qin Yu seemed to be unable to stand. He swayed and then fell.

Jiu Xiao was silent.

He lowered his head and looked at Qin Yu, thinking about something.

This was the first time Jiu Xiao had seen such a stubborn person.

Qin Yu gritted his teeth. He wanted to get up, but he couldn’t.

“D*mn it…” Qin Yu was extremely unreluctant.

As expected, the huge gap between realms could not be made up for at all.

Just when Qin Yu thought that he had failed, Jiu Xiao suddenly said coldly, “Give me a reason why you must go to Zhongzhou.” Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Qin Yu looked up at the sky with difficulty and said in a trembling voice, “That place… There’s someone I want to see…”

Jiu Xiao was silent.

He did not understand his feelings, but he was touched by Qin Yu’s stubborn attitude.

“I think that person must be very important,” Jiu Xiao said with emotion.

Then, Jiu Xiao looked at Qin Yu who was on the ground, and said, “I agree with your request.”

Qin Yu, who was lying on the ground, suddenly trembled.

He immediately wanted to thank him, but Jiu Xiao continued, “But this mission is extremely dangerous, so you can’t participate. I can only take you to Zhongzhou and come back with me within the limited time.”

After hearing Jiu Xiao’s words, Qin Yu’s heart was filled with gratitude.

How could he not understand Jiu Xiao’s intention?

With such an arrangement, Qin Yu could avoid dying on the mission.

“Many… many thanks,” Qin Yu, who was lying on the ground, said with all his might.

After getting an affirmative response, Qin Yu’s tense nerves relaxed.

Without support, Qin Yu soon fell into a coma.

Jiu Xiao lowered his head to look at Qin Yu, his heart filled with complicated emotions.

As the number one cultivator of Demon-slaying Peak, he knew what was most important to a cultivator.

Of those people who stood on the mountaintop, which one of them wasn’t as stubborn as this? Which one of them didn’t have an undefeatable heart?

Jiu Xiao bent down, picked up Qin Yu, and sent him all the way back to the cave abode.

After returning to the cave abode, Jiu Xiao threw Qin Yu to Jue Wu.

Seeing Qin Yu covered in blood, Jue Wu was furious. She suddenly stood up and raised her hand, and a purple light appeared!

Jiu Xiao knew how terrifying this light was, so he did not dare to underestimate it and raised his hand to receive it.

“Boom!”

A terrifying tremor reverberated through the cave abode, and the forest far away rumbled.

“You b*stard! It’s fine if you disagree, but why did you beat him up like this?” Jue Wu’s eyes were wide open, and a terrifying killing intent burst out from her body!

“When did I say no?” Jiu Xiao said coldly.

“What do you mean?” Jue Wu was stunned. She frowned and asked.

Jiu Xiao ignored what she said and said, ” Tell Qin Yu that he fought for this opportunity himself. If he wants to thank anyone, he should thank himself.”

After saying this, Jiu Xiao turned around and left.

After he left, Jue Wu quickly came forward to transfer spiritual energy to Qin Yu.

…

The following day.

Qin Yu finally woke up from the coma.

The first thing he did when he woke up was to get up and shake his head.

Looking around at the familiar environment, Qin Yu looked at Jue Wu and asked hurriedly, “How did I come back?”

“Jiu Xiao sent you back. What had happened? He actually beat you up to this extent?” Jue Wu frowned and asked.

Hearing this, Qin Yu was finally relieved.

“It’s fine. I did it of my own free will. Don’t blame him. I should even thank him,” Qin Yu grinned and said.

Jue Wu mumbled, “He told me to pass you a message. He said that if you want to thank someone, you should thank yourself. It’s so funny.”

Jue Wu waved his hand as if she was too lazy to care about the matter between the two.

Qin Yu’s face was full of smiles, and he felt extremely excited in his heart.

After waiting for so long, he could finally go to Zhongzhou!
