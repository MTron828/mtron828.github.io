Chapter 1471: Chapter 1,471: Leaving the Eternal City

Qu Zhu was right. This was the holy region after all, the world of cultivators.

If they wanted to go to a place, there were many ways, such as teleportation formation or the Void Gate.

“If we can stop them, we’ll stop them,”Xiao Hai said.

He didn’t stay any longer and quickly left.

Qin Yu, Jue Wu, and the others also didn’t stay in the Eternal City. Instead, they planned to go to Hua Ning mountain.

After walking out of the Eternal City, Qin Yu happened to meet Zhong Wu, who was about to leave.

Zhong Wu also saw Qin Yu. He stopped and said with a faint smile, “Qin Yu, long time no see.”

Qin Yu looked at Zhong wu coldly and said, “Don’t worry. I’ll turn your bones into ashes very soon.”

“Crush my bones and Scatter My Ashes? hahahaha! Come and try!”Zhong wu shouted.

Qin Yu couldn’t bear it any longer. He took a step forward and said coldly, “Come, I will fight you to the death today. Take Out Your White Bone Club!”

“Okay, I also want to kill you!”Zhong Wu said coldly.

“Don’t be angry.”

At this moment, Yong Ji rushed out of the city.

He looked at them with a smile and said, “What hatred can’t be resolved? Why Are You So Angry?”

Zhong wu snorted and said, “For the sake of Mr. Yong Ji, I’ll spare your life.”

Qin Yu didn’t just grit her teeth.

Zhong Wu was a b * Stard. His strength wasn’t even worth mentioning. He just relied on the white bone club to show off.

Qin Yu did not say anything else. Guan Zhuang and Jing Bai were still in the hunter organization. The tragedy that happened to Zhen Yue must not happen again.

After Zhong Wu left, Yong Ji said politely, “You have come from afar. Why Don’t you stay in our eternal pole city for a few days?”

Qu Zhu stretched lazily and said, “Different paths lead to different strategies. Yong Ji, have you forgotten? We don’t agree to let the people of the northern region enter.”

These words were obviously sarcastic to Yongji, so Yongji could naturally hear it.

He smiled bitterly and said, “Brother Qu Zhu misunderstood me. I never said that I would agree to let them enter the South Province. I just remain neutral and strive for peace.”

“Oh? Brother Yongji really cares about the world.”Qu Zhu cupped his hands, but his tone was clearly filled with contempt.

“Alright, Alright. We still have things to do when we go back, so we won’t stay any longer.”Jue Wu waved her hand, then pulled Qin Yu and left.

The group of people left Yongji City and rushed towards Hua Ning mountain.

At this moment, the first elder and the others had already returned to the Heavenly Cloud sect.

His expression was incomparably green. When he thought of the treatment he received in Yongji city, he was filled with fury.

“This Xiao Hai really doesn’t put our Tianyun sect in his eyes!”First Elder said angrily.

“Do you really think that our Tianyun sect can’t do anything to him? Sooner or later, our Tianyun sect will kill all of you!”

Just when First Elder was angry, the deputy sect master suddenly walked in and said, “The sect master has come out of seclusion. He wants you to meet him.”

The eyes of the first elder lit up and he said excitedly, “What? The sect master has come out of seclusion? That’s great. where is he now?”

“He’s on the Cultivation Mountain,”said the vice sect master.

Hearing this, the first elder immediately rushed towards the cultivation mountain.

These few days, the first elder had a stomach full of grievances. He was waiting to complain to the sect master.

All the way to the Cultivation Mountain, he saw the sect master’s slender figure with his back facing him.

“Sect master, you have finally come out of seclusion!”The first elder hurriedly ran over and said.

The sect master slowly turned around. With his hands behind his back, he looked at the first elder and said, “If there’s anything, just say it.”

The first elder immediately recounted the events that had happened in the past few days in an exaggerated manner.

This included how Qin Yu had come to the Heavenly Cloud sect to challenge them, and how Xiao Hai had ignored the first elder in the Eternal Limit City.

“And that Jue Wu. I almost died in her hands. Sect master, these people must die!”The first elder said fiercely.

The sect master leaned over and looked at the first elder, but didn’t say anything for a long time.

“Sect master, you have tolerated them too much. If we don’t teach them a lesson, I’m afraid they will really treat our Tianyun sect as mud!”The first elder continued to say when he saw the situation.

The sect master sighed slightly, and then asked, “Why did you agree to let the people of the northern land enter the South Province?”

The first elder was stunned, and then said somewhat awkwardly, “He said that he would take out the Sacred Heart technique as a reward. You know that the Sacred Heart Technique is the ultimate art of the northern land, he...”

“Just because of the Sacred Heart Technique?”The sect master interrupted the first Elder’s words.

The first elder seemed to have sensed the sect master’s displeasure, and for a moment, he didn’t know what to say.

“South Province... Who’s in charge?”The sect master asked.

The first elder hurriedly said, “Of course it’s Our Heavenly Cloud sect. You’re in charge...”

“Then does the northern land’s people entering our South Province count as an invasion?”The sect master continued to ask.

The first elder opened his mouth, not knowing how to reply.

“If it counts as an invasion, does the heavenly cloud sect count as an invasion?”The sect master’s soul interrogated.

“As the acting sect master of the Heavenly Cloud Sect, why would you make such a stupid decision?”

The first elder was sweating profusely from the question. He stammered, “Sect master, i. . . You...”

At this moment, he suddenly thought of Yongji and hurriedly said, “It’s Yongji. The meeting that Yongji held had nothing to do with me...”

“Yongji?”The sect master’s face turned cold. “Is Yongji secretly developing such a powerful force good or bad for our Heavenly Cloud Sect? is Yongji the biggest beneficiary of the northern land’s invasion of the southern region and the damage to the rights and interests of the Heavenly Cloud Sect?”

A few words made the first elder flustered.

He knelt on the ground with a plop and said in a trembling voice, “Sect... sect master, I was muddle-headed. You... you should punish me...”

The sect master said in a deep voice, “Since you are the leader of the Tianyun sect, your thoughts shouldn’t be too small, and your vision shouldn’t be so short-sighted.”

“If your eyes are forever fixed on personal gains and losses, personal grudges, you will never be able to become a leader.”

How could the first elder dare to say anything more? He knelt on the ground and continuously promised. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

After saying this, the sect master once again had his back facing the first elder.

He waved his hand and said, “Go down.”

The first elder was stunned. He probed, “Sect master, you... You Mean?”

“I will still be in closed door cultivation during this period of time. I hope you won’t disappoint me again.”The sect master said indifferently.

Hearing this, the first elder hurriedly nodded and said, “Of course, of course!”

The sect master waved his hand, and the first elder was immediately sent to the foot of the Cultivation Mountain.

At this moment, the entire cultivation mountain closed, as if layers of fog had appeared to obscure one’s vision.

The fog enveloped the entire mountain, and no one could step into it.

...

Hua Ning Mountain.

Qu Zhu, Jue Wu, and Qin Yu were sitting together.

Of course, Wen Da and Wen er were also chattering on the side, as if they had a lot to say.

“I really admire Xiao Hai,”said Qu Zhu at this time.

“Since I’ve known him, I’ve never seen him rest for a day,”said Qu Zhu with emotion.

Jue Wu rolled her eyes and said, “Do you think everyone is like you, leisurely every day?”
