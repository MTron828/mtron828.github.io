Chapter 2465 Heavenly Monster Race

Lei Xin wiped away the blood from the corner of his mouth.

“Is Lord Gao Lan really a monster race? He has helped us defeat the monster race army many times.”

“Yeah, could there be a mistake?”

“Are these thieves slandering Lord Gao Lan?”

“I don’t believe it!”

The surrounding people seemed dumbfounded after seeing Gao Lan was demonized. Many people still thought this was a deceptive trick created by Qin Yu.

Chen Zhisha sighed almost imperceptibly.

“Gao Lan, you’re actually a monster race? What’s wrong with you? Could it be that everything about you is an illusion? Your son and wife are also in this village!”

Huangshan asked in disbelief. They had always lived here.

Ever since the invasion of the monster race, he had been blocking the demons from entering. He did not expect him to be a monster race. He found it somewhat hard to accept for a moment.

“Thump! Thump! Thump!”

A mocking smile appeared at the corner of Gao Lan’s blood-red eyes. His heart was beating like a drum.

The tremendous heartbeat even caused ripples in the nearby lake. The blood vessels all over the body bulged with the breathing, looking tremendously terrifying.

“Hahaha! Humans are too weak. Can these fake emotions bring you any increase in strength? If not, why not throw it away?”

A distorted smile appeared on Gao Lan’s face. Suddenly, he slapped Yun Huangshan.

With a body size of several hundred feet, this palm encompassed the entire space around Yun Huangshan.

“Boom!”

Gao Lan let out a strange laugh. The sharp claws of his five fingers rubbed against the air, creating a trail of flame. The massive force even shook the entire town.

“Dodge!”

An astonishing power burst out from his Yongquan acupoint. Then, his right leg fiercely pulled out and clashed hard with Gao Lan’s palm.

Qin Yu touched his right leg, which almost became numb, and fear filled his eyes.

After he opened the fourth acupoint, the Yongquan acupoint on his right foot, a small cycle seemed to have formed among the four acupoints.

The acupoints in his legs were now full of immense power, but they only ended in a draw with Gao Lan.

“Hehehe! You do have some strength!”

A sinister smile appeared in Gao Lan’s scarlet eyes. He bent his legs slightly.

Just as he was about to exert his strength, a crisp sound sounded.

“Banish!”

The space on his ground instantly collapsed, and he fell into the void.

The entire space fell silent. No one had expected Yan Ruoxue to be able to deal with this hidden monster race so effortlessly.

“Awesome.”

Qin Yu could not help but exclaim in admiration. If Yan Ruoxue really wanted to fight with this hidden monster race, she would probably have a 50 – 50 chance. However, this spatial banishment had thrown him into the void.

With Gao Lan’s strength, it should not be difficult for him to tear open the void again. However, when he reappeared, no one knew where he had gone to.

“Where will Gao Lan appear if he tears open the void when the time comes? Will it appear in other human towns?”

Chang Mang asked curiously.

“It’s hard to say. When one enters the void turbulence and encounters turbulence, one might be trapped in the space-time warp. Even if you have the power of tribulation, it’s hard to tear the void and return to the continent. Moreover, this monster race spy’s body has been strengthened. He doesn’t have the internal qi of the power of rules. It’s not easy to break through the spatial turbulence.”

Yan Ruoxue said softly.

“Why? We came here a long time ago. Why is he a monster race?”

Yun Huangshan held his head. He still could not accept this fact.

The person they had been interacting with day and night was actually a spy of the monster race.

“The heavenly monster race is the most difficult race to detect in the monster realm. No matter how I combined the Heart of Thunder with my Way of Thunder, I still could not detect this demonic qi. Now, I understand.”

Lei Xin said with a frown.

“The Immortal Emperor of the Yun family of the human race once died because he was possessed by the heavenly monster race. He suddenly turned around in a great battle and dealt a vicious blow to the human race.” Flower Granny stared at Chen Zhisha and seemed to have discovered something.

Qin Yu was also shocked.

“The number of heavenly monster race is tremendously rare. Back then, the one who was possessed was also the heavenly monster Godly King. However, he died after the Immortal Emperor. I didn’t expect to see this race again. It seems that there must be some conspiracy among the monster race here. Otherwise, they wouldn’t have mobilized this race.”

Flower Granny carefully analyzed the entire matter because the heavenly monster race was tremendously rare, to begin with.

It now actually appeared here at this time meant there would be an arrangement here by the monster race.

“Oh my god! Is there no way to guard against it?” Chang Mang’s hair stood on end upon hearing this. How could he guard against such a thing?

“Flower Granny, I still don’t understand. Is this heavenly monster race something like a nightmare that instigates inner demons? How do we guard against such things?”

Yan Ruoxue still could not understand how the heavenly monster race existed.

“This kind of monster race has no specific physical form. Therefore, it’s impossible to spy on its existence. It exists in the Path of Heaven as a mass of soul energy, and after entering the human body, they directly fuse with the soul energy.”

Lei Xin explained.

“Fuse? Is it because this kind of monster race is actually a kind of soul power that survives with this kind of energy?” Qin Yu guessed and said.

“You can put it that way. The most terrifying thing is that they can possess your soul and silently change your cognition. They will start from your most basic thinking. They will let you see some illusions. In the end, you will find white is black, and right is wrong. Moreover, this is an instinctive change in the soul. It means that you don’t even know that you have been demonized.”

Reinlei continued to clarify Yan Ruoxue’s doubts.

“Oh my god! Is there no way to guard against it?” Chang Mang’s hair stood on end upon hearing this. How could he guard against such a thing?

“There’s no other way except by adhering to your fundamental beliefs. There are very few records of the battle between the human and the heavenly monster races. This also indirectly proves that the battle between the human and the heavenly monster races has more losses than victories. However, once the heavenly monster race fuses with the human soul, once the human dies, the heavenly monster race will also die.”

“Fortunately, they have this weakness. Otherwise, the heavenly monster race will be invincible.” Qin Yu dared not be negligent. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

The ability of such a thing was beyond imagination. It could change a person’s cognition from the foundation.

This method was even more terrifying than Nightmare. It could subtly change a person’s thinking.

It was equivalent to the monster race killing humans, so they had to resist. The heavenly monster race could make you feel that the monster race killing humans because of the humans ‘fault.
