2195 Green Spirit Tree

Yun Qingyun did come to the courtyard’s door numerous times to bring food for Qin Yu. However, she could not step into the courtyard, so she could only give up.

In the blink of an eye, Qin Yu had already stayed in this courtyard for more than ten days.

During this period, Qin Yu did not move at all. However, he could no longer advance in a short time with his current cultivation realm.

So, he got up and walked out of the courtyard, leisurely strolling around on this warship as if taking a casual stroll in a garden.

Unknowingly, Qin Yu arrived at the Yun family’s cultivation ground.

Not many people were on the cultivation ground. There were only five or six people. They sat cross-legged and slowly adjusted the spirit energy here.

Not far away, a massive ancient tree towered into the sky, with a lush and verdant canopy and dense branches and leaves.

The ancient tree emanated wisps of spiritual energy that lingered between the trunk and the leaves like mist. Every wisp was so fresh and pure as if condensed from the essence of heaven and earth.

The trunk of the ancient tree was silver-gray, with a smooth and mirror-like surface, emitting a faint golden glow. The crisscrossing patterns on the trunk resembled a peculiar scroll, recording the long river of years experienced by the ancient tree. Some patterns were delicate as silk, while others were robust and powerful. Each pattern showcased the resilience and wisdom of the ancient tree.

Looking at this ancient tree, Qin Yu could not help but think to himself, “This ancient tree is not simple. It seems that the spiritual energy of the entire warship comes from this ancient tree.”

At this moment, Qin Yu could not help but have a fleeting thought of “robbing,” but it quickly passed. After all, the Yun family was quite kind. Moreover, this ancient tree was not something that he must acquire.

Under the ancient tree, Yun Fengqing and Yun Qingyun were sitting cross-legged while Uncle Qun was standing beside them.

At this moment, they were absorbing the spiritual energy emitted by the ancient tree with all their might, hungry and thirsty for the nourishment of spiritual energy and the improvement of their cultivation.

Uncle Qun noticed Qin Yu’s figure at this moment and waved at him, saying, “Qin Wuji, come and cultivate together.”

Just as Qin Yu wanted to decline, Uncle Qun had already arrived before him.

Facing Uncle Qun’s enthusiasm, Qin Yu could not bear to refuse and thus followed him to the ancient tree. It was also a good opportunity to inquire about the origin of this ancient tree at a closer distance.

Standing under the tree, Qin Yu could not help but raise his head to look at the massive ancient tree.

Uncle Qun said somewhat proudly, “This ancient tree is called the Green Spirit Tree. My Yun family’s ancestors brought it out from a sacred land at the cost of great sacrifice. Relying on this ancient tree, my Yun family has leaped to become a top-notch aristocratic family.

Qin Yu raised his head and looked at this ancient tree. He extended a wisp of divine sense and entered the tree.

Soon, Qin Yu felt traces of divine sense from the ancient tree.

“Hmm?”

Qin Yu raised his eyebrows.

This ancient tree had developed its own divine sense!

It usually took tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of years for an ancient tree to develop a trace of divine sense. However, the divine sense of the Green Spirit Tree in front of him had been growing even stronger, and had even started to possess self-awareness!

“This ancient tree… Where did it come from?” Qin Yu exclaimed.

Uncle Qun instantly became even more proud and delighted. He smiled and said,” This tree originates from a mysterious zone and is recorded in my Yun family’s ancient books. I didn’t look at its specific location carefully. Rumor has it that this Green Spirit Tree comes from the immortal world and is an object born from the heavens. It has tremendous uses for cultivation.”

Qin Yu was silent.

This Green Spirit Tree was indeed tremendously mysterious. Relying on this Green Spirit Tree, it was sufficient to feed an aristocratic family or even several aristocratic families as the spiritual energy emitted from it seemed to have never ceased.

“My Yun family ancestors brought three trees out from the mysterious zone. After bringing out these three ancient trees, my Yun family’s ancestors also passed away,” Uncle Qun sighed with emotion and said.

Qin Yu said with a little surprise, “Your Yun family has three Green Spirit Trees?”

Uncle Qun nodded and replied with a solemn expression, “Yes, our Yun family indeed has three Green Spirit Trees. Other than this Green Spirit Tree in the cultivation ground, two were respectively located in the Yun family’s forbidden area. These three Green Spirit Trees were treasures brought back by the ancestors of my Yun family from the mysterious zone. They are the foundation and important resources of my Yun family’s cultivation path.”

Qin Yu was shocked by this information. He knew the extraordinary value of the Green Spirit Tree. Just one Green Spirit Tree was sufficient to make the Yun family look down on its peers. But the Yun family possessed three Green Spirit Trees. This was truly unimaginable.

“The spiritual energy of the three Green Spirit Trees gathered together, forming a massive spiritual power ground, providing the Yun family with endless spiritual energy nourishment. Our Yun family’s cultivators can break through the cultivation realm even faster and increase their strength under the Green Spirit Tree’s protection.”

At this point, Uncle Qun instantly became even more proud.

A faint sense of surprise lingered in Qin Yu’s heart.

This Green Spirit Tree was indeed a rare item in the cultivation world. And the Yun family’s ancestors could bring out three trees from the so-called “mysterious zone”. It was evident that the origin of this mysterious zone was tremendously extraordinary.

“I wonder which planet or continent the Yun family comes from?” Qin Yu asked.

Uncle Qun smiled and replied, “My Yun family is located on the Cloud Splendor Continent, a mysterious continent located at the edge of the universe. The Cloud Splendor Continent was rich in cultivation resources and spiritual energy and was suitable for cultivators to cultivate. Our Yun family has lived on the Cloud Splendor planet since ancient times. We have cultivated for generations and accumulated a rich cultivation heritage and resources.”

Qin Yu frowned slightly. He was unfamiliar with the Cloud Splendor Continent. However, it had such rich cultivation resources that were enough to make the Yun family hold a position that could not be underestimated in the cultivation world.

However, the strength of the Yun family did not seem as strong as he had imagined.

He did not know if it was because they did not have comprehension or their talents were too poor.

“What is the position of the Cloud Splendor Continent in the universe?” Qin Yu continued to ask.

Uncle Qun thought for a while and then replied, “The Cloud Splendor Continent is located at the star field at the edge, far from the mainstream center of the universe. It is a relatively hidden continent without too much interference and competition. This has allowed our Yun family to cultivate and develop independently.”

Qin Yu did not utter a word but silently memorized the name of the Cloud Splendor Continent. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Perhaps he could go there and explore it if there was a chance in the future.

After that Qin Yu looked at Yun Fengqing and Yun Qingyun, who were cultivating under the ancient tree.

The two devoured the spiritual energy “ravenously. As the spiritual energy was too abundant, it even caused a burden on their bodies to a certain extent. A rather strange fog spread around them.

Seeing this scene, Qin Yu instantly understood what had made the Yun family decline.

He shook his head and said, “Uncle Qun, your Yun family’s cultivation method has gone astray.”
