1902 Chang’e? The Moon Rabbit?

“Ancestral granny? Is it the ancestor of the Gu family?” Qin Yu asked.

“Otherwise? Granny Gu is a legendary woman. She was once an existence that suppressed an entire region,” Si Shifeng said with a faint smile.

Qin Yu couldn’t help but frown slightly. He continued to ask, “What about the rabbit? Was it also passed down by Granny Gu?”

This time, it was Si Shifeng’s turn to be surprised. He frowned slightly and said, “How did you know?”

Qin Yu ignored Si Shifeng. He couldn’t help but mutter, “Could it be that Granny Gu is the Chang’e Isn’t this too ridiculous?” Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

After coming to Holy Region, Qin Yu found many people who could be associated with ancient myths. It couldn’t help but make people suspicious.

“What’s Granny Gu’s name?” Qin Yu continued to ask.

Si Shifeng raised his eyebrows and said, “Does this have anything to do with you? Don’t you think you’re asking too many questions? Do you think you can ask about the existence at Granny Gu’s level?”

Qin Yu still had more to ask, but Si Shifeng walked away quickly, ignoring Qin Yu and the others.

“The more I look at this Cold Moon Palace, the more it looks like it,” Chang Mang sighed and said.

Qin Yu nodded slightly. The entire Cold Moon Palace indeed resembled the Moon Palace very much.

A massive temple stood in front of them. White trees full of celestial aura were planted in front of the temple, and a long stretching path passed through most of the Cold Moon Palace. Small rivers wrapped in fog were on both sides of the path.

After passing through the small path, they arrived in front of the temple. A massive crystal ball-like radiance was in front of the temple. It constantly flashed with exotic colors.

“Look! What is that?” At this moment, Chang Mang pointed to a place not far away and said softly.

At a glance, a tremendously big tree tree was in the distance. This tree was as thick as a few people hugging together and was hundreds of meters tall. It seemed to have been there for a very long time.

“It’s an Osmanthus tree,” Qin Yu said in a low voice.

“Mmm, it resembles the Osmanthus tree in the legend,” Chang Mang nodded slightly and said.

This time, Qin Yu could not help but suspect all of this was not a coincidence. Probably there was some inextricable connection.

“Everyone, please come in.” At this moment, a few of them had already arrived at the temple. Saintess Gu bowed slightly and invited them in.

Qin Yu and the others didn’t stand on ceremony and strode in.

It was even more shocking inside the temple. The entire temple was stone-made, and stone stairways were all over. Everything in the surroundings was wrapped by a celestial aura. It made people feel relaxed and pleased as if they had stepped into Asgard.

Saintess Gu led them to the table. With a wave of her hand, Jade Dew appeared in front of them.

After that, Saintess Gu instructed people to send over the Divine Medicine and handed it to Si Shifeng and the others.

“Saintess Gu, we made a wrong judgment when we entered the sanctum this time. We didn’t get any treasures. It serves us right,” Yan Yunfan said directly.

“But I’m a little curious. Why do you trust this unknown Qin Yu?” Yan Yunfan said with a curious look.

Saintess Gu seemed to have already thought of an excuse. She smiled and said, “Mr. Qin has personally proven his ability to me. I have no choice but to trust him.”

“In that case, he’s indeed a Master of Path of Heaven?” Si Shifeng’s eyes widened.

“That’s right,” Saintess Gu said with a smile. “I’m afraid his abilities are beyond the two of you.”

Although the two Masters of Path of Heaven were not convinced, they did not say anything.

“I’ve underestimated him,” Si Shifeng said in a strange tone.

“It’s normal for a snob to look down on others,” Chang Mang replied impolitely.

Si Shifeng’s eyes narrowed. He looked at Chang Mang and said, “Just now, in the sanctum, I couldn’t do anything to you and let you speak freely. Do you think I don’t dare to touch you now, do you?”

“You can try by all means!” Chang Mang said coldly.

“Both of you are my guests. Why must you be so impulsive?” Saintess Gu laughed and said.

Si Shifeng snorted coldly and said, “I’ll spare you for the time being for the sake of Saintess Gu.”

Qin Yu also waved his hand, indicating Chang Mang to calm down.

That night, Saintess Gu prepared a sumptuous meal for them. There were even fairies dancing in the Cold Moon Palace. It was quite enjoyable.

At night, Saintess Gu arranged accommodation for them, allowing Yan Yunfan and the others to recuperate.

After leaving the palace, Si Shifeng came to Yan Yunfan’s room.

He sat beside Yan Yunfan, smiled, and said, “Brother Yan, how are your injuries?”

“I’m fine,” Yan Yunfan nodded slightly.

“Mmm,” Si Shifeng responded. He then smiled and said, “Brother Yan, what do you think this Qin Yu and Saintess Gu have obtained from that sanctum? Since Saintess Gu has invited him to the Cold Moon Palace, they must have obtained something extraordinary.”

“After all, it’s the sanctum of the Tribulation Stage great cultivators. Although it’s incomplete, it must have supreme treasures,” Yan Yunfan muttered.

Hearing this, Si Shifeng struck while the iron was hot. “They should have been ours! It’s a pity a kid called Qin Yu has snatched them away!”

Yan Yunfan glanced at Si Shifeng and said, “No one owned the items. They belong to whoever gets them. Besides, we made a mistake in our judgment.”

Si Shifeng frowned and said, “Brother Yan, are you really willing to give this to them?” Forget about Saintess Gu. Who the hell is that Qin Yu?”

“Then what are you going to do?” Yan Yunfan glanced at him and said.

“When he walks out of the Cold Moon Palace, we force him to hand over the treasures immediately!” Si Shifeng said, narrowing his eyes.

“I’m not interested,” Yan Yunfan said relentlessly. “As for what you do, it has nothing to do with me.

Si Shifeng still wanted to say something, but Yan Yunfan waved his hand and said, “It’s getting late. It’s time for me to rest now.”

Seeing Yan Yunfan give the order to leave, Si Shifeng had no choice but to nod and say, “Alright.”

….

On the other end, Qin Yu and Chang Mang were in the same room.

Although Saintess Gu had arranged separate accommodations for them, Chang Mang wanted to stay with Qin Yu. They had no choice but to sleep in the same bed.

...

“Qin Yu, do you think this place has anything to do with the Moon Palace? Could it be that Saintess Gu’s granny was Chang’e?” Chang Mang muttered.

“No idea,” Qin Yu shook his head and said. “But ever since I entered the Mystic Realm, everything seemed so mysterious.”

“Sigh! If she’s really a descendant of Chang’e, it’s going to be interesting,” Chang Mang sighed and said.

Qin Yu didn’t say anything, but he was too in a daze.

Ever since he stepped into Holy Region, his previous worldviews had been greatly impacted.

Now that things had come to this stage, he had no choice but to believe many things.

Chang Mang didn’t say anything else. He fell asleep in the bed while Qin Yu tossed and turned, unable to sleep. Thus he got up and walked out of the room.
