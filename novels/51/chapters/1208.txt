Chapter 1209: Chapter 1,209, forcibly bringing back the divine sense? 

President Bao didn’t dare to say anything. He hurriedly took out his phone and was about to tell the other party to stop.

But he called several times, but no one picked up.

President Bao immediately panicked. His hands trembled as he said, “I... I’ll send people to chase them now! I guarantee that your mother won’t have any problems!”

Qin Yu stepped in front of boss Bao and said coldly, “Bring me there immediately.”

“Okay, okay.”At this time, boss Bao was already panicking and kept nodding his head.

Qin Yu grabbed boss Bao and his body suddenly jumped, directly piercing through the palace.

“Tell me, where is My Mother?”Qin Yu asked coldly.

How would boss Bao Dare to lie? He told Qin Yu the exact location.

Qin Yu followed Chief Bao’s location and rushed to his destination.

This was triangle city, an extremely chaotic small country. The Flames of war could be seen everywhere here. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

The location chief Bao gave was quite far from the palace. Even with Qin Yu’s speed, it would take him dozens of minutes.

Along the way, Qin Yu tried his best to rush to his destination.

“We are almost there, we are almost there, we are just ahead...”chief Bao said with a trembling voice.

He kept praying in his heart, afraid that something would happen to Qin Yu’s mother.

Qin Yu’s glabella lit up as he activated his desolate divine eye and rushed forward.

Soon, he saw the figures of a few men. They seemed to be digging something.

As for his mother, she was lying on the side.

Qin Yu’s expression changed drastically. He couldn’t care less about chief bao in his hand. He threw him aside and desperately rushed toward his mother.

Even though Qin Yu was extremely fast, he was still one step too slow.

By the time Qin Yu arrived, his mother was already without any signs of internal QI.

She was lying on the ground, and her body had already become a bit cold.

“Mom...”Qin Yu hugged his mother’s figure. He tried to restore her life, but it was too late.

This made Qin Yu extremely sad. He hugged his mother’s body tightly, and tears could not help but flow out.

Qin Yu never thought that he would not even see his mother’s last face. No matter how much Qin Yu shouted, this corpse would not have any reaction.

“Who the F * CK Are You?”Chief Bao’s men held shovels and pointed at Qin Yu’s nose.

Qin Yu held his mother’s body and slowly stood up.

He looked at them coldly and said in a low voice, “I will make all of you pay the price.”

After saying that, the bodies of those people instantly turned into a bloody mist.

Qin Yu held his mother’s body and felt a chill in his heart.

He didn’t shed another tear, but his face was terrifyingly cold.

Then, Qin Yu hugged his mother’s body and walked toward the palace where the Lord was.

But when he returned to the palace, Chief Bao and Old Meng had already disappeared.

As for the Lord, what he left in the palace was actually just an afterimage, not his real body at all.

Qin Yu took a deep breath and said in a low voice, “Do you think you can escape? I will definitely, definitely kill you all...”

However, Qin Yu was not in a hurry. Instead, he brought his mother and rushed back.

There was a pill in his pill formula. It was called the Ice Soul Divine Pill. This kind of pill could protect the corpse from rotting.

On the same day, Qin Yu returned to the Divine Alchemist Pavilion and found Xiang Danqing.

After the pavilion master left, Xiang Danqing became the Pavilion Master of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion.

It was already late at night, but Qin Yu pushed open the door and walked in.

Xiang Danqing, who was sleeping soundly, was immediately jolted awake. When he saw who it was, he couldn’t help but be shocked.

“Qin Yu, you...”

“Senior Xiang, I’ll explain to you in the future.”

“I need you to help me refine a pill, the Ice Soul Divine Pill. I’ll give you the pill formula.”Qin Yu’s words sounded extremely calm.

Xiang Danqing frowned and said, “I’ve heard of the Ice Soul Divine Pill, but I don’t have the pill formula.”

“I do. I’ll tell you how to refine it,”Qin Yu said coldly.

Although Xiang Danqing had many doubts, he didn’t ask further. He immediately agreed to Qin Yu’s request and nodded.

The two of them went to the warehouse to get the medicine. Then, under Qin Yu’s guidance, they began to refine the ice spirit pill.

The refinement of the ice spirit pill was not easy. In addition, Xiang Danqing didn’t know the pill formula, so the pill was successfully refined three times.

However, when the ice spirit pill took shape, it was already the night of the second day.

An icy blue pill lay in the medicinal cauldron.

“Pavilion Master Xiang, please help me feed the pill.”Qin Yu looked at Xiang Danqing.

Without spirit energy, many things were very inconvenient to do. Qin Yu could not even send the pill into his mother’s body.

Xiang Danqing agreed and then, according to Qin Yu’s request, sent the ice spirit pill into his mother’s stomach.

After doing all this, Xiang Danqing asked, “Qin Yu, what’s going on? Who Is this woman?”

Qin Yu was silent for a moment, and then said, “My mother.”

“Your... Your Mother?”Xiang Danqing couldn’t help but be shocked.

Qin Yu grunted, and then said, “Pavilion Master Xiang, I’ll leave my mother’s body to you for now.”

Xiang Danqing frowned and said, “Qin Yu, Don’t blame me for being direct. She’s already dead. Even if you keep her body, she won’t be able to come back to life.”

Qin Yu took a deep breath and said, “I have to think of a way to bring back her divine sense.”

As soon as he said that, Xiang Danqing’s eyes widened.

Bring back her divine sense?

In layman’s terms, it was to forcefully bring back her soul.

But where the soul would go after death, no one knew until now.

Some said that it would return to the Heavenly Dao, while others said that it would enter the next reincarnation. But where it would go, no one knew.

Could it be that Qin Yu wanted to go to the underworld to forcefully take it back? That was a little too exaggerated.

No one had ever done such a thing before.

Qin Yu did not explain to Xiang Danqing anymore. He turned around and left the Divine Alchemist Pavilion.
