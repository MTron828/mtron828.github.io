“There is no need to be nervous. Although you and I are both in the Saint Kingdom, we belong to two different lines. We are destined not to have any interactions. ”

The woman said with a smile.

“My name is Zi Yan, a native of the central region of the Saint Kingdom. This time, I’m only here to obtain a magical artifact that doesn’t belong to this place. This is also a Dharma Treasure we entrusted to this place.” ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Qin Yu frowned slightly. His Nine Heavens Manifestations Gaze was locked onto the woman in front of him.

However, he could not detect any internal qi from this woman no matter how hard he tried. It was as if she was just an ordinary person.

It was just that the activation of the Nine Heavens Manifestations Gaze made him discover something.

In the entire Treasure Repository Pavilion, all the magical artifacts had a thread of energy that was slowly moving in one direction.

Even on this level, these powerful magical artifacts were still unable to resist the terrifying energy.

Qin Yu slowly circulated his energy and poured it into the Nine Heavens Manifestations Gaze again.

Qin Yu increased the gaze’s power to the maximum. He was shocked that it was not just the magical artifacts in the Treasure Repository Pavilion that were attracted by this terrifying power.

This included the Demon Sealing Valley and even the entire Ancient Demon Land.

Countless extremely fine energy lines slowly flowed to the source, at the top of the Treasure Repository.

The dense energy threads made Qin Yu think that this was the original energy of this world.

Coupled with the presence of many magical artifacts, Qin Yu did not notice this situation before this.

At this moment, he felt a chill run down his spine. In other words, there was something in the sixth level of the Treasure Repository Pavilion that was absorbing the power of all the natives of the Ancient Demon Land and the Demon Sealing Valley.

Moreover, they were completely unaware of it, or perhaps they would be helpless against it even if they knew.

“You can sense it?”

A hint of surprise flashed across Zi Yan’s face, but she immediately sighed.

Hearing this sigh, Qin Yu instantly sensed that something was wrong.

Qin Yu only felt a wave of infatuation in front of him. Without him noticing, he had already arrived in another world.

The scene in front of him could only be described as a screen with mountains and rivers carved on it.

Qin Yu instantly felt that he had arrived in a world of mountains and rivers.

However, he discovered that the mountain spring water here was flowing gracefully, and the luxuriant leaves of the ancient trees that looked like paintings were also fluttering slightly with the breeze.

An old stone tablet stood on the peak of a mountain.

A murderous intent emanated from the stone tablet. The moment Qin Yu saw it, a stream of blood tears flowed from his eyes.

An intense pain surged into Qin Yu’s divine soul.

“This… Why does it feel so familiar? It’s just that I can’t remember. What is this?”

Immortal Emperor Yao’s voice was filled with pain. He seemed to have seen something familiar but he couldn’t recall it.

“Since it doesn’t stay for a moment, then with a thought, it will destroy all living beings in the world.”

The woman had put on a mask at some point and said softly.

This is the name of this gravestone, Ten Directions Annihilation. ‘Ten Directions Annihilation’ means that all ten directions of the world will collapse.”

“Run.”

Hearing this name, Immortal Emperor Yao spoke without hesitation in the sea of consciousness.

Run? Where could he run to?

Qin Yu cursed. He wanted to run too.

He guessed that he should be in the domain of Ten Directions Annihilation now. This place had already formed its world. Even if he wanted to escape, he could not do so at all.

The tombstone on the peak of the mountain suddenly trembled slightly. A huge vortex suddenly appeared on the top of the tombstone.

The moment the vortex opened, a terrifying energy fluctuation suddenly soared into the sky.

The instant that destructive energy surged up, Qin Yu’s body was sent flying fiercely.

His body crashed heavily in front of a mountain. Even his body suffered terrifying injuries.

Just the wind at the edge of this energy was enough to cause him to be seriously injured.

The violent energy dispersed in the air like fireworks.

The ten directions were Heaven, Earth, East, South, West, North, Gate of Life, and Death.

Qin Yu even saw an illusion appear for a moment. He saw himself when he was born.

There was also his future self, who was old and standing among the bones in the sky.

Past and future.

The two images were now in the lava, filled with flames. Their faces were filled with despair.

These ten directions corresponded to ten different strange moves- Fire

Burning Sky, Earth Water Army Breaking, Qian Kun Wind, Kunlun Severing, Thunderclap, Earth Returning to Origin, Star Shifting, Qian Kun Extinguishing, and Heaven and Earth Extinguishing.

Qin Yu’s eyes were dazzled. This kind of terrifying ultimate move had already far exceeded what he had seen so far.

This seemed to have surpassed the power of True Consciousness.

In an instant, Qin Yu’s body turned into a bloody mist.

The Heart of Saint Kingdom, the vessel Zhuang Zhou’s Dream Butterfly.

His vision blurred as countless butterflies danced in the air. A dream-like internal qi surged from his body.

In the next moment, his shattered body had become a dream. He was once again living in reality.

However, it made Qin Yu’s heart sink.

At this moment, he was still in the world of Ten Directions Annihilation. In the blink of an eye, his body was torn apart again.

This artifact spirit’s attack was too terrifying. This kind of energy could destroy him in the blink of an eye.

Zhuang Zhou’s Dream Butterfly was activated once again.

Fortunately, he had captured Xin Yue’s Zhuang Zhou’s Dream Butterfly with a container. Otherwise, he would have died instantly even if he had the Seal of Heaven Returning.

In a short period, he had died three times in a row.

“This is Ten Directions Annihilation’s divine sense space. Your divine sense has been pulled here. Use your divine soul to resist the power of this divine thought. Otherwise, Zhuang Zhou’s Dream Butterfly’s power might not be enough! ”

Immortal Emperor Yao’s voice instantly resounded in Qin Yu’s sea of consciousness.

However, that voice disappeared in an instant. Qin Yu’s consciousness was once again suppressed by the terrifying power fluctuation.

Qin Yu gathered all the willpower in his body and turned all the power of his soul into a defensive shield, trying to resist this destructive will.

This method had little effect. However, after enduring for nearly one-twentieth of a breath, his divine soul was torn apart again.

The instant this Ten Directions Annihilation released its move, Qin Yu had already died countless times in a short time.

What followed was the extreme pain of his divine soul being torn apart every time.

This pain penetrated deep into the divine soul and was more terrifying than

any torture.

The power of Zhuang Zhou’s Dream Butterfly that circulated in his body had already become very weak.

“Oh no! If this continues, I’m afraid I won’t be able to last for long! I can’t die here!”

Qin Yu’s mind was greatly alarmed. He gritted his teeth tightly.

At this moment, every drop of his soul power was like boiling water erupting

with all its power..
