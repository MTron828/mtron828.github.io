Chapter 1464: Chapter 1,464. No Way, right? No Way

Qin Yu’s name was like thunder in the Southern Region. Almost everyone knew of his existence and his battle achievements.

However, Mo Haoyan did not put Qin Yu in his eyes at all.

He snorted coldly and said, “So what if you are Qin Yu? If you can kill Ling Yun, I, Mo Haoyan, can!”

Qin Yu did not want to kill the innocent. He only wanted to settle the score with Mo Hong.

Therefore, he looked at Mo Haoyan coldly and said, “Let your father come to see me. I don’t want to attack you.”

“Hahahaha!”Mo Haoyan burst into laughter!

“Qin Yu, if you are afraid, just say it. I, MO haoyan, will spare your life!”

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and said, “Do you really want to die?”

Mo haoyan shouted, “Cut the crap. I’ve long wanted to see so for myself how capable you are! If you have the guts, go wait outside the door right now. How can I spare you if you kill my brother!”

After saying this, Mo Haoyan turned around and was about to leave.

At this time, Hammer hurriedly stopped Mo Haoyan and said in a low voice, “Young master, this Qin Yu can even defeat the first elder of the Tianyun sect. You...”

“What? Am I inferior to him, Qin Yu?”Mo Haoyan snorted coldly.

Hammer knew that he was determined to give up. No matter how much he tried to persuade him, it was useless. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Therefore, he could only hurriedly leave Las Vegas and rush to the Mo family, hoping to tell Mo Hong about this news.

“Qin Yu, I’ll wait for you outside. If you have the guts, come and Fight!”Mo Haoyan snorted coldly, turned around and walked out.

Qin Yu stood up and said coldly, “You want to take revenge for your brother, and I want to take revenge for my friend. That’s good too. Life and death are fated, right?”

After saying this, Qin Yu walked out of the gambling city.

Mo Haoyan had already flown into the air. He stood in the air and looked at Qin Yu coldly.

“Qin Yu, I’ll wait for you in the wild forest three stars away.”After seeing Qin Yu walking out, Mo Haoyan immediately shouted and rushed toward the wild forest.

Qin Yu didn’t waste any words and immediately chased after him.

The surrounding crowd also wanted to watch this battle and followed him.

Outside the forest.

Mo Haoyan’s internal Qi had already erupted to the extreme. The surrounding trees emitted rustling sounds under his internal Qi.

In a short while, Qin Yu rushed to the scene.

Unlike Mo Haoyan, Qin Yu’s internal Qi looked extremely calm, like a pool of stagnant water.

“Qin Yu! You killed my brother, I will definitely kill you today!”Mo Haoyan roared angrily.

Qin Yu sneered, “That will depend on whether you have the ability or not.”

Mo Haoyan did not waste any words. He raised his hand and transformed into a great dao.

The Great Dao rumbled and shook between his palms. In the next second, Mo Haoyan roared angrily and the power of the Great Dao instantly crushed towards Qin Yu!

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes slightly. This Mo Haoyan indeed had some ability. He could borrow the power of the Great Dao at such a young age. No wonder he was praised as a genius.

Unfortunately, the person he was facing was Qin Yu!

Facing the sweeping aura, Qin Yu did not have any flashy internal Qi. He raised his hand and threw a punch!

“Boom!”

At the instant of the collision, the trees were instantly uprooted!

The originally dense wild forest seemed to have been shaved, becoming bare!

And the power of the Great Dao that Mo Haoyan had evolved was just the tip of the iceberg. Under Qin Yu’s punch, it instantly shattered.

All of the DAO technique seemed to have disappeared at this moment, leaving only Qin Yu’s Golden Fist!

“You really have some ability!”Seeing this, Mo Haoyan did not retreat but instead advanced, full of fighting spirit!

His hands quickly slide, once again to deduce the Great Dao, in a moment, in front of him will appear as if the air of chaos.

The heaviness of the internal Qi was strange in the undulations of his hands.

Subsequently, this internal QI is evolved into a divine picture!

Divine picture sullen from the ancient internal Qi, such skills, it is really shocking!

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes. His body shook and the saintly body technique was fully displayed.

Following that, Qin Yu raised both his hands and a mark suddenly appeared!

This was the golden light mark, a technique that Qin Yu had also evolved himself!

The competition between the new generation shocked everyone. Everyone was dumbstruck.

The Mark suddenly arrived and smashed the divine picture into pieces. Even the void started to tremble.

Qin Yu did not waste any more time. He directly activated the line word formula and arrived in front of Mo Haoyan in the blink of an eye.

Mo Haoyan’s pupils constricted, and he immediately shot backward.

However, Qin Yu, who activated the line word formula, was definitely not someone mo haoyan could compare to. There was no way for him to escape.

The two sides stood at this moment and completely erupted. They used all their spells, and it was as if the world was about to collapse!

Boom! Boom! The collision of their spells shattered the void.

And the residual power that the two of them unleashed killed countless people!

The surrounding crowd could not help but widen their eyes.

Was this the younger generation under the Golden Age? Their abilities were probably not weaker than the older generation’s experts!

“Clang!”

At this moment, the sound of a gong being struck rang out in the void.

If one looked carefully, it was Mo Haoyan who had transformed into a huge divine staff that struck Qin Yu’s body!

Qin Yu did not move at all. He only looked at Mo Haoyan coldly.

Mo Haoyan’s pupils constricted, as if he did not dare to believe it!

Qin Yu raised his arm and smashed it fiercely onto the divine staff. The spell he had transformed into instantly disappeared!

Mo Haoyan thought that things were not looking good and immediately shot backwards.

However, Qin Yu did not give him a chance. He used the line word formula to chase after him and smashed his fist onto Mo Haoyan’s chest!

The power of this punch was endless. It directly pierced through Mo Haoyan’s chest! Fresh blood sprayed out at this moment!

Mo Haoyan’s expression changed drastically. He did not care about the injuries on his body and directly retreated!

Blood splattered all over the sky. The smell of blood was extremely pungent. The smell of internal Qi was extremely pungent.

Mo Haoyan stood in the air and panted heavily. He looked coldly at Qin Yu in the distance.

He knew in his heart that Qin Yu in front of him was probably the strongest opponent he had ever met.

On the other side, Hammer had already rushed home and informed Mo Hong about this matter.

Mo Hong, who had a calm expression, immediately changed his expression when he heard these words!

“What did you say? ! Haoyan is currently fighting with Qin Yu?”Mo Hong’s face was filled with fear.

“Yes, family head, hurry up and go. Otherwise, it will be too late!”Hammer said hurriedly.

Mo Hong did not dare to waste any time. He put on all of the Mo family’s strength and rushed towards the direction of the wild forest.

In the wild forest.

Qin Yu was like a god of war. His body was bathed in fresh blood. This fresh blood all came from Mo Haoyan!

Mo Haoyan appeared to be in a rather miserable state. He was panting heavily. Clearly, he had fallen into a disadvantageous position.

“You really have some ability,”Mo Haoyan said coldly.

However, Qin Yu sneered and said, “If this is all of your strength, then I’m afraid you’ll die here.”

Mo Haoyan’s expression changed slightly. He said coldly, “It’s still unknown who will win or lose between the two of us. Don’t be happy too early!”

Qin Yu sarcastically said, “I only used 50% of my strength. Aren’t you? Don’t tell me that this is all of your strength?”
