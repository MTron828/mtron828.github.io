Looking at these people in front of him, Qin Yu couldn’t help but feel a little angry.

Ever since he advanced to the Foundation Establishment Stage, Qin Yu became more and more calm about killing people.

However, Qin Yu had promised Old Mister Su to give them a way out, so Qin Yu still took a deep breath and endured it.

“Then what do you want?” Qin Yu said coldly.

Su Wu snorted. “With my son’s ability, he can at least earn 100 million. How about this, give us 100 million and we’ll leave immediately!”

Hearing this, Qin Yu couldn’t help but snicker.

“100 million? You actually dare to ask sp much,” Qin Yu said coldly.

Su Wu snorted. “Stop talking nonsense. If you don’t give it, I won’t leave today!”

After saying that, Su Wu walked straight to the door and sat down.

Qin Yu looked at Su Wu coldly and didn’t say anything for a while.

“Are you also a member of the Su family?” After a long while, Qin Yu suddenly said.

Su Wu froze and said impatiently, “What does it have to do with you?”

“You only need to answer yes or no,” Qin Yu said coldly.

Su Wu didn’t say anything for a moment, and his mind raced.

Updates by

He knew that Qin Yu and the Su family didn’t have a good relationship. If he was a member of the Su family, he probably wouldn’t get anything today.

Thinking of this, Su Wu said proudly, “I haven’t returned to the Su family’s home for more than ten years. Strictly speaking, I’m not a member of the Su family!”

“Okay.” Qin Yu sneered. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“Since you’re not a member of the Su family, I’m relieved.” After saying that, Qin Yu strode towards Su Wu.

Su Wu was immediately overjoyed! It seemed that he had guessed correctly!

Thinking of this, Su Wu immediately stood up from the ground.

“It’s only 100 million. I didn’t even ask for more. At least you’re sensible.” Su Wu said with a smile.

Su Wen and the others muttered, “I didn’t expect this kid to actually have 100 million. F * ck.”

However, in the next second, Su Wen and the others’ faces turned extremely pale!

Qin Yu waved his hand and smashed Su Wu’s head!

Then, Qin Yu grabbed his collar and threw him in front of Su Wen!

“Since you’re not a member of the Su family, then you can go to h*ll,” Qin Yu sneered wickedly.

Su Wen and Sun Yumei were both stunned. Half a second later, a scream came out from Sun Yumei’s mouth!

“Murder!” Sun Yumei’s whole body was trembling. Her legs went weak, and she wanted to run, but she couldn’t move her legs!

Su Wen’s lips were also trembling, and he was so scared that he peed his pants.

Qin Yu looked at Su Wen coldly and said, “If you don’t want to die, you’d better not provoke me again!”

Su Wen had already been scared to death, so how could he dare to talk back?

He pulled Sun Yumei away and struggled to get into the car.

As soon as they got in the car, the two of them sped away.

Looking at their departing car, Qin Yu took a deep breath.

He flicked his finger and a wisp of spiritual fire landed on Su Wu’s body.

In less than a minute, Su Wu’s body was burned clean.

After returning home, Qin Yu changed his clothes and prepared to go to the warehouse to find some herbs to familiarize himself with alchemy.

However, when he arrived at the warehouse, Qin Yu found that the warehouse was empty.

“There aren’t any more herbs.” Qin Yu frowned.

He wanted to call Lei Hu, but on second thought, since he had nothing to do, he might as well go out for a walk.

Thus, Qin Yu got into his car and drove towards the Chinese Medicine Hospital.

Very soon, Qin Yu arrived at the entrance of the Chinese Medicine Hospital.

Today, there were especially many people at the entrance of the Chinese Medicine Hospital. There was even a large sign hanging at the entrance that had a line of words clearly written on it: Provincial Capital’s Chinese Medicine Genius, Zhou Tong, giving free medical services!

“Chinese Medicine Genius?” Qin Yu frowned slightly. “No wonder there are so many people today.”

After Qin Yu parked the car, he walked into the hospital.

He saw a long line in the hall of the hospital.

An old man in his sixties was sitting in front of him. This old man looked like a sage, but there was arrogance in his eyes.

“This person should be Zhou Tong.” Qin Yu glanced over and murmured in a low voice.

Since he was a Chinese Medicine Genius, he would definitely be present at this Chinese Medicine Conference.

Thinking of this, Qin Yu decided to line up to see the Chinese Medicine Genius’s abilities.

Thus, Qin Yu stood at the back and waited quietly.

The line was very long because many people came after hearing the news.

Among them, there were those who actually needed to see a doctor, and there were also those who came to join in the fun.

A woman holding a child was standing in front of Qin Yu. This woman was dressed extremely shabbily, and one look was enough to tell that she was from a poor family.

Two hours later, Qin Yu was finally getting closer and closer to Zhou Tong.

The peasant in front of him hurriedly carried the child and walked forward. She said anxiously, “Doctor... Doctor Zhou, please take a look at my daughter. Her fever has not subsided. She has been taking a lot of medicine, but they don’t work...”

Zhou Tong glanced at the peasant, but didn’t say anything. Instead, he closed his eyes.

The farmer’s wife was instantly stunned, and she hurriedly said, “Doctor Zhou, can you examine the child?”

Zhou Tong still didn’t say anything. He just placed his hand on the table.

The farmer’s wife had a puzzled look on her face. She asked tentatively, “Doctor... Doctor Zhou?”

At this time, a young man beside Zhou Tong said impatiently, “What are you clamoring about? Why are you so insensible? Why did you come empty-handed?”

The peasant said awkwardly, “Didn’t it say free consultation on the sign?”

“Free consultation? Don’t you know that you should bring something to show respect to Doctor Zhou?” The young man said impatiently.

“How d*mn stupid. No wonder you’re poor.” The young man muttered in a low voice.

The peasant immediately panicked. She searched all her pockets and gathered more than a hundred yuan.

“Doctor... Doctor Zhou, this is all the money I have on me...” the farmer’s wife’s hands trembled as she handed over a hundred yuan.

“Oh right, these are eggs I brought from my hometown. I will give it to Doctor Zhou...” the farmer’s wife hurriedly picked up a basket of eggs from the ground.

Zhou Tong glanced at it and couldn’t help but snicker, “Do you think I’m a beggar?”

With that, the basket of eggs was knocked to the ground!

Qin Yu, who was standing behind, immediately showed a cold expression. Zhou Tong was actually quite pretentious. Since he wanted money, why did he say that he would give free consultations?

“Hey hey hey, move aside!” At this moment, a man with golden chains walked over and squeezed to the front rudely.

“Sir, it’s... I came first...” the peasant said in a low voice.

The man with the golden chains glared at the peasant and berated, “So what if you came first? I’m going to cut the line. Even if you’re not satisfied, suck it up!”

After saying this, the man with the golden chains took out a jade pendant from his pocket and stuffed it into Zhou Tong’s hands.

“Doctor Zhou, can you help me take a look?” The man with the golden chains winked and said.

Zhou Tong silently accepted the jade pendant, and his attitude instantly changed drastically.

“What can I do for you?” Zhou Tong asked kindly.

The man with the golden chains smiled and said, “It has been quite long now. Can you help me take a look?”

Zhou Tong laughed and said, “No problem!”
