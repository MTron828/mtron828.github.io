Chapter 1668: Chapter 1,668, opening of the Mystic Realm 1 Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Qin Yu’s mind was in a mess. He didn’t know who to trust.

The person who came to warn him must be related to him. However, no matter how Qin Yu thought about it, he couldn’t think of anyone other than the Yan family. “...”

Moreover, with his strength, he was obviously above Qin Yu. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have such speed.

Looking at the Silent Qin Yu, Zhuo Jing was also silent at the side, not disturbing his thoughts.

After a long time, Qin Yu stood up and sighed, “Let’s go.”

“Go? Where?”Zhuo Jing asked with some doubt.

Qin Yu said in a deep voice, “The Eastern Wilderness.”

Zhuo Jing was immediately shocked. He looked at Qin Yu and said, “Do you still decide to go?”

“Yes. I want to go and take a look no matter what. Otherwise, I’ll never know the truth,”Qin Yu said in a deep voice.

Then, Qin Yu looked at Zhuo Jing and said, “This trip to the East Wilderness might be full of dangers. You Go back first. I’ll go alone.”

“What are you talking about?”Zhuo Jing smiled.

“As long as you go, I’ll accompany you.”

Qin Yu opened his mouth, not knowing what to say.

He patted Zhuo Jing’s shoulder and said, “Thank you.”

Since they had made up their minds, they did not waste any more time. They set off immediately and went straight to the east barren.

Along the way, Qin Yu was very uncertain. He looked behind him and frowned.

“What’s Wrong?”Zhuo Jing asked.

“I don’t know if it’s because of my heart, but I feel like someone is watching me in the dark,”Qin Yu said in a low voice.

Zhuo Jing subconsciously turned his head and looked back. He frowned and said, “Why don’t I feel it? Maybe it’s because of your heart.”

Qin Yu didn’t say anything. His divine sense had always been very sensitive, and he rarely made mistakes.

The feeling of being stared at was very uncomfortable.

“I hope I’m overthinking.”Qin Yu took a deep breath.

The two of them sat on the Divine Eagle. After several days, they finally arrived at the territory of the East Wilderness.

This place was not as dangerous as they had imagined. On the contrary, it was an extremely vast desert with no end in sight.

Besides the desert, there was nothing else.

“How could this be?”Zhuo Jing frowned.

“It looks like there’s nothing here.”

Qin Yu activated the desolate God’s eye and scanned the desert.

Unfortunately, under the desolate God’s eye, there was still nothing here. It was just a desert.

“It seems like my guess is correct,”Qin Yu said in a low voice.

“Guess? What Guess?”Zhuo Jing asked.

Qin Yu pointed at the desert in front of him and said, “I’m afraid that there are countless mystic realm hidden here.”

“You mean... The Small World?”Zhuo Jing said in surprise.

Qin Yu grunted and said, “That’s the only possibility.”

“Then what should we do?”Zhuo Jing asked.

“Follow me,”Qin Yu said.

His body shook and he descended from the Godly Eagle.

Following that, the two of them walked towards the desert.

The eastern wastelands was extremely vast, and its area was endless. Even if they diligently activated the desolate divine eye, they would not be able to see anything.

They walked through the desert, covering the largest area with their divine sense, afraid of missing out on anything.

But unfortunately, after an entire day, the two of them still found nothing.

Even the sand buried under the desert was not visible.

The sky gradually darkened and a sandstorm rose.

Qin Yu and Zhuo Jing stopped in their tracks.

“Are we just going to walk aimlessly?”Zhuo Jing asked.

Qin Yu glanced at Zhuo Jing and shook his head. “We are not aimless.”

Zhuo Jing seemed a little puzzled and stared at Qin Yu, trying to figure out something.

Qin Yu did not say much. Along the way, he had been trying to find the hidden mystic realm, but so far, he had not found it.

This was an extremely tiring thing. For a whole day, Qin Yu looked a little weak.

“Let’s Rest for now,”said Qin Yu.

Zhuo Jing grunted and the two sat on the ground, slowly absorbing the extremely weak spiritual Qi from the surroundings.

It had to be said that the fate of the east barren was really exhausted. The thinness of the spiritual Qi was even less than that of Earth.

“I can’t guarantee that there’s no one watching us from the dark, so we have to be careful,”said Qin Yu.

Zhuo Jingen nodded. He held the Silver Spring in his hand and said, “Don’t worry.”

Qin Yu trusted Zhuo Jingen, so he simply lay on the desert and fell asleep.

It was a peaceful night.

The next day, Qin Yu’s state of mind recovered by more than half. They did not waste any time and continued to move forward, searching for the mystic realm in the desert of the east barren.

After another full day, the two of them still had very little to gain.

“The east barren really doesn’t seem to have much value anymore,”Zhuo Jing said with a sigh.

Qin Yu also had some doubts.

According to Xiao Sheng’s words, the fate of the east barren should have returned in this great era. It was the land of the rising dragon, so how could there be not even a trace of spiritual qi? 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Am I really deceived?”Qin Yu took a deep breath. He was unwilling to believe it.

The two dao discussions with Xiao Sheng made him admire Xiao Sheng greatly.

If he knew that Xiao Sheng was harming him, Qin Yu would not be able to accept it.

Just as Qin Yu was feeling sad, he suddenly felt something strange.

This feeling was extremely familiar. It was the feeling brought by the hidden mystic realm!

“There really is a mystic realm!”Qin Yu was instantly overjoyed!

He closed his eyes slightly and felt the Great Dao. Threads of light appeared in Qin Yu’s mind.

Qin Yu slowly walked forward in this direction. He raised his hand as if he was searching for something.

Zhuo Jing, who was at the side, did not dare to disturb him when he saw this. He could only follow silently by the side.

“It’s here.”Finally, Qin Yu stopped at a certain spot.

His hand was placed in the void in front of him, and rays of light were emitted.

“There really is a mystic realm...”Qin Yu took a deep breath, and his eyes couldn’t help but be a little excited.

Zhuo Jing quickly ran up and hurriedly asked, “What did you find?”

Qin Yu pointed at the void in front of him and said, “There... is a mystic realm hidden here.”

“Mystic Realm? You are a Mystic Realm Master?”Zhuo Jing said in surprise.

Qin Yu smiled bitterly and said, “No, but I can indeed find a mystic realm. I even learned a little bit when I was in my hometown.”

“A little bit? You are really modest,”Zhuo Jing said with a bitter smile.

Qin Yu sighed and said, “I am not modest. I don’t have any mystic keys.”

It was indeed too difficult to find a mystic realm master now. Moreover, once a mystic realm master was found, no matter what treasures there were, they would not belong to him.

Qin Yu raised his palm and placed it in the air in front of him, slowly feeling the mystic realm.

At this moment, he was stunned and said excitedly, “This... This is actually an open mystic realm!”
