Chapter 352: Old Mister Yan Was Scolded Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

“What did you call me?” Old Mister Yan’s expression gradually turned cold.

The young man didn’t realize the seriousness of the matter at all. He impatiently said, “I called you an old fart! Hurry up and scram. I don’t want to bully an old man!”

After saying that, the young man looked at Qin Yu again.

He pointed at Qin Yu’s nose and said, “You want a ticket, right? Sure, 10,000 yuan per ticket! If you don’t have the money, that’s fine too. Let your girlfriend accompany me, and I’ll give it to you for free. How about it?”

Hearing this, Qin Yu couldn’t hold it in any longer.

He raised his hand and slapped the young man’s mouth.

Even though he restrained the force of the slap, it still made the young man’s mouth bleed.

“You... you dare to hit me? You... just you wait!” The young man said with a sullen look.

Qin Yu looked at him coldly and said, “If you spout nonsense again, I’ll break your mouth.”

Sensing the killing intent from Qin Yu’s body, the young man immediately trembled in fear.

He opened his mouth, but didn’t dare to say a word.

Qin Yu bent down and snatched the tickets from his hand, then returned them to the window.

After buying his own ticket, Qin Yu turned to look at Yan Ruoxue and said with a smile, “Let’s go.”

Yan Ruoxue seemed to be a little angry, and her expression looked a little unnatural. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“Okay, don’t be angry.” Old Mister Yan said with a smile.

“We came out to play today. Don’t let a nobody ruin our mood.”

When she heard Old Mister Yan’s words, Yan Ruoxue’s expression eased up slightly.

At the window, the young man was helped up by his companion.

“Mr. Qiang, are you okay?” His companion asked.

The young man called Mr. Qiang had a vicious look on his face. He spat on the ground and said through gritted teeth, “No one dares to lay a hand on me, Li Wenqiang! When we get to the North Province Island, I’ll definitely kill them!”

“Of course. Your uncle is the owner of the North Province Island. It’ll be a piece of cake!”

Li Wenqiang snorted coldly and said, “I will call my uncle later. As long as we get to the North Province Island, I’ll let them never return!”

...

Qin Yu and the others didn’t take this matter to heart.

The three of them took the tickets and boarded the cruise ship.

Sitting on the ship and looking at the scenery on the sea, Old Mister Yan couldn’t help but lament, “It’s really been a long time since I’ve been so relaxed.”

Yan Ruoxue hooked her arm around Old Mister Yan’s neck and said with a smile, “Then let’s go out more often in the future!”

“Haha, okay. I just don’t know if there’s still a chance.” Old Mister Yan stroked his beard and said with a smile.

“Bah, bah, bah, don’t spout nonsense!” Yan Ruoxue said unhappily.

Old Mister Yan didn’t know how to react. He hurriedly said, “Okay. It’s my fault. I take it back!”

Looking at this warm scene, Qin Yu couldn’t help but feel a little worried.

If Old Mister Yan left, how sad would Yan Ruoxue be?

“No matter what, I will save your life.” Qin Yu made up his mind inside.

The cruise ship slowly sailed on the surface of the sea. After about an hour, they finally arrived at North Province Island.

As a famous scenic spot in Jingdu, the environment here was naturally very beautiful.

The architectural style of the entire island was very varied. There were both ancient style buildings and modern flamboyant ones.

Qin Yu tried to feel the spiritual energy and found that the spiritual energy here was abnormally dense!

The entire sea seemed to have spiritual energy lingering and condensing above it!

“An endless stream of tourists come here every day. How can the spiritual energy be so dense?” Qin Yu couldn’t help but sigh inside.

“Don’t just stand there. Let’s go!” Yan Ruoxue tugged at Qin Yu’s arm.

Qin Yu nodded and followed Yan Ruoxue all the way to a small teahouse.

The construction of this teahouse was quite oriental. Even the waiters were dressed in ancient clothing.

The three of them found a tea table and sat down. Soon, the waiter came up with a tea list.

“Well... I’ll take a pot of Longjing tea.” Yan Ruoxue pointed at the tea list and said.

“Okay, a pot of Longjing tea!” The waiter shouted.

At this time, Li Wenqiang also boarded the North Province Island.

As soon as he got off the cruise ship, Li Wenqiang hailed a taxi and walked towards the office building in the center of the North Province Island.

This office building was where the owner of the North Province Island, Feng Chong, was located.

As the overlord of the North Province Island, Feng Chong had absolute power!

There was a large group of martial artists under his command, and there were nearly ten Inner Strength Grandmasters among them!

Li Wenqiang came to an office and pushed the door open.

As soon as he entered, he saw a middle-aged man processing documents.

After seeing Li Wenqiang, the middle-aged man smiled and said, “Wenqiang, why are you here?”

Li Wenqiang said with a dark expression, “Mr. Zeng, I was just beaten up by someone on the North Province Island!”

The man called Mr. Zeng said with some surprise, “Beaten up by someone? Who dares to lay hands on you on the North Province Island?”

“I don’t know him. Mr. Zeng, hurry up and help me take revenge!” Li Wenqiang waved his hand impatiently.

As Feng Chong’s subordinate, Mr. Zeng had done a lot of things for Li Wenqiang.

This time, of course, it was no exception.

He immediately pulled up the surveillance cameras and looked for Qin Yu and the others’ figures.

“It’s them!” Soon, Li Wenqing found Qin Yu and Yan Ruoxue.

Mr. Zeng took a look and said, “They’re at the tea shop. I’ll bring some people over now.”

“Bring a few more people. That kid is pretty tough,” said Li Wenqiang.

Mr. Zeng smiled and said, “Don’t worry. This is our territory. Even if the king comes, he won’t be able to do anything.”

Then, Mr. Zeng called a few people and drove to the tea shop.

Three black cars slowly stopped at the door of the teahouse.

As soon as the car stopped, Li Wenqiang and Mr. Zeng came out of the car with four to five people.

“Mr. Zeng, why are you here?” The waiter in the teahouse asked in surprise.

Mr. Zeng waved his hand and then led his people into the teahouse.

“They’re there!” Li Wenqiang pointed in the direction of Qin Yu and said anxiously.

Mr. Zeng immediately led his men to Qin Yu’s direction.

“Kid, do you still remember me?” Li Wenqiang said aggressively.

Qin Yu frowned slightly and said, “What? Do you still want to be beaten up?”

Li Wenqiang was instantly furious!

He was about to flare up when Mr. Zeng reached out to stop Li Wenqiang.

Then, Mr. Zeng looked at Qin Yu and the other two and said, “Do you know who this is? This is the nephew of the North Province Island’s boss!”

“So?” Qin Yu asked expressionlessly.

“Hehe, don’t play dumb. Come with me. Don’t disturb others,” Mr. Zeng said indifferently.

At this time, Old Mister Yan couldn’t help but smile and said, “Young man, you’d better bring your boss here.”

Mr. Zeng frowned slightly. He looked at Old Mister Yan and said, “Who are you?”

Before Old Mister Yan could answer, Li Wenqiang cursed, “Take this old b*stard with you! He’s the one who talks too much nonsense!”

“I’ll imprison you guys first, then I’ll deal with you guys slowly!” Li Wenqiang said with a vicious look.
