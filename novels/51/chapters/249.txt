Chapter 250: The Law of the Jungle! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Countless Inner Strength Past Masters were sent flying by Qin Yu’s slap. They were like kites with broken strings and were swaying from side to side.

Qin Yu stood there with a cold expression. A strong murderous aura lingered around his body.

No one dared to say anything. The neutral group also canceled their plans to attack.

With such a huge difference in strength, there was no way they could fight.

The faces of the Inner Strength Past Masters and Inner Strength Grandmasters turned pale, and they felt slightly regretful.

If they had known earlier, they wouldn’t have provoked Qin Yu!

Their surroundings were isolated by a barrier. Now, they couldn’t run even if they wanted to! They were screwed!

“Attack together and kill him for me!” Han Yilong shouted anxiously.

However, this time, no one listened to his orders.

“Mr. Qin, we are willing to give up the fight for the Divine Medicine. Can you let us live?” At this time, someone suddenly said.

Qin Yu glanced at him and sneered. “When you attack me, you should consider the consequences.”

“Since I said I would kill all of you, then I won’t let any of you live.”

“Qin Yu, don’t go too far!” Someone shouted angrily.

“Go too far?” Qin Yu couldn’t help but find it funny.

“When you attacked me in order to kiss up to Han Yilong, did you ever think of the fact that you guys were going too far?”

“Why? Now that you’re facing death, you know that you’ve gone too far?”

Everyone was speechless.

“Qin Yu already has the intention to kill. Even if we beg him, it’s useless. Why don’t we join forces and kill him together!” Someone suggested.

“This kid’s strength is beyond our imagination. Even if we join forces, we might not be his match.”

“If it really doesn’t work, we’ll just stall for time. When the barrier of the Divine Medicine disappears, we can leave and find an opportunity to kill him!”

This suggestion received the approval of most people. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

But if they could think of it, how could Qin Yu not think of it?

Qin Yu didn’t say anything more and walked towards them step by step.

The pressure made everyone’s expressions pale and they kept retreating.

“Pa!”

Very quickly, Qin Yu stretched out his hand and grabbed a person’s head! Then, he absorbed it with the Heaven Swallowing Technique!

One, two, in the blink of an eye, three of the ten Inner Strength Grandmasters had died!

“If this goes on, we will all die here!” These people were terrified and extremely anxious!

At this moment, an old man stood out.

This person looked like a sage, but there was a vicious look in his eyes.

This old man ignored everyone. He looked at Qin Yu, cupped his hands and said, “Mr. Qin, why do you have to commit such a crime? Why don’t you stop here for the sake of me, Gu Jinhong?”

“Gu Jinhong!?”

Upon hearing this name, everyone was immediately shocked, then they felt ecstasy!

“Master Gu is actually here!”

“Master Gu is a famous figure in the Jiang Bei region. Rumor has it that he once wiped out all the families in the Jiang Bei region single-handedly!”

“With Master Gu around, we might be able to survive!”

“Master Gu, please kill him!”

Gu Jinhong ignored him. He looked at Qin Yu with a smile, as if he was waiting for Qin Yu’s answer.

Just as Qin Yu was about to speak, Jiang Gu rushed over.

He leaned against Qin Yu’s ear and whispered, “Mr. Qin, you must not provoke Gu Jinhong! He was called a genius decades ago, and his strength is even more unimaginable now!”

“Most importantly, his mentor is the famous Gu Taichu!”

Upon hearing Jiang Gu’s words, Qin Yu said indifferently, “I got it. You can go back.”

Jiang Gu nodded and said with some worry, “Mr. Qin, remember what I said. You must never provoke Gu Jinhong!”

Qin Yu ignored him and looked up at Gu Jinhong, who wasn’t far away.

Gu Jinhong said with a nonchalant smile, “Mr. Qin, as long as you’re willing to stop, I, Gu Jinhong, will remember this favor.”

“Master Gu, why are you wasting time talking to him?! Remember his favor? Who does he think he is?!”

“Hurry up and kill this kid!”

Gu Jinhong ignored them and just waited for Qin Yu’s answer.

Qin Yu looked at Gu Jinhong coldly and asked with a nonchalant smile, “Let me ask you, how do you compare with the Han family?”

Gu Jinhong was stunned. He clearly didn’t expect Qin Yu to ask such a question.

After thinking for a moment, Gu Jinhong said, “Mr. Qin, you must be joking. The Han family is a top family in Jingdu. Naturally, I can’t be compared to them.”

“I don’t even show respect to the Han family. Why should I show respect to you?”

“You also made a move just now, right?” Qin Yu said coldly.

Qin Yu’s response immediately shocked everyone.

“You really don’t know your place! You’re too big for your britches!”

“Master Gu was kind enough to give you a chance, but you actually didn’t appreciate it.”

Jiang Gu, who wasn’t far away, felt a headache coming on.

He gave him heartfelt advice for nothing!

Gu Jinhong took a deep breath and said with a smile, “Mr. Qin, you’ve already taken advantage of us. Moreover, everyone is willing to give you the Divine Medicine, so why are you so aggressive? You have to forgive and forget!”

“Aggressive?” Qin Yu couldn’t help but laugh out loud.

“If I were just an ordinary martial artist, would you have stood up and talked to me? I’m afraid you would have smacked me to death long ago!”

“Now that you know you’ren’t my match, you want to negotiate peace?”

“Gu Jinhong, why are you pretending to be a good guy now? Why didn’t you say this when they wanted to kill me just now?”

The more Qin Yu spoke, the more agitated he became. He glared at Gu Jinhong and berated, “Stop talking big with me. It’s nothing more than the law of the jungle. Whoever tries to stop me today will die!”

Gu Jinhong’s expression gradually turned cold.

He said somewhat threateningly, “So you’re determined to fight to the death?”

“I don’t want to repeat myself a second time. If you want to make a move, feel free to do so,” Qin Yu said coldly.

“Okay!” Gu Jinhong sneered.

“Qin Yu, don’t think that you’re invincible. There is always someone better than you!”

Gu Jinhong turned to look at the people behind him and shouted, “Everyone, I want to use your internal qi to kill this guy!”

After saying that, Gu Jinhong slowly waved his hands in the air. Then, a tai chi diagram appeared in front of him!

The moment the tai chi diagram appeared, Gu Jinhong’s internal qi began to increase!

“Please lend me your internal qi for the time being!” Gu Jinhong shouted.

Along with this shout, the internal qi of more than ten Inner Strength Grandmasters instantly poured into Gu Jinhong’s body like a spring!

“It’s the top technique of the Gu family, the Tai Chi Seal!” Jiang Gu’s expression suddenly changed!

“Rumor has it that the Tai Chi Seal can borrow the strength of others and unleash astonishing power!”

Even Fang Yue’s expression was somewhat unsightly. Back then, Gu Jinhong had relied on this technique to kill countless Inner Strength Grandmasters!

Among them, there were even several Inner Strength Grandmasters whose strength was far above Gu Jinhong’s!

The instant the Tai Chi Seal was formed, a terrifying pressure spread out!

Countless people at the scene couldn’t bear it any longer, and they fell to the ground on their knees!

“What bullsh*t Tai Chi Seal?! Watch me smash it with one punch!” Qin Yu roared angrily, and golden light burst out from his entire body!
