Chapter 1249: Chapter 1,249, Peerless Genius 

There was a long queue at the venue.

Although there was no limit to the number of participants this time, most of them had been duped, leaving behind only a few.

There were already more than a hundred people who had come to take the test, but only two were selected.

Other than the fourteen-year-old grandmaster, there was also a man in his thirties.

“There are so many people.”

Qin Yu led the crowd and arrived at the scene.

They patted the back of the crowd and waited quietly.

However, Qin Yu’s reputation was extremely great. His arrival immediately attracted the attention of many people. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“Qin Yu is here,”someone said in a low voice.

“He is the number one person in the world. How could he not come?”

“Qin Yu seems to have brought quite a number of people. Those mighty realm experts are also following behind him.”

Many people turned around and looked carefully at Qin Yu.

And those who were bold also came over to greet Qin Yu.

The restlessness of the crowd naturally attracted the attention of the people in front.

A young man in charge of the test looked in the direction of Qin Yu and said with a frown, “Who is that person?”

The young girl beside him shook her head and said, “I don’t know. He might be a little famous here.”

“He’s not a little famous. His name is Qin Yu. He’s the number one person in the world! His strength is unparalleled!”The young man who was taking the test hurriedly said.

Hearing this, the few people who were in charge of the test frowned slightly.

“Number one person in the world? He doesn’t look old. He seems to be only forty or fifty years old,”the young girl said in a low voice.

The young man snorted coldly and said, “The number one person in the world here is nothing. It’s just that there are no tigers in the mountains.”

The few of them did not say much to the young man’s words, as if they agreed with his words.

At this moment, the young girl beside him suddenly said indifferently, “Since he is the number one person in the world, he naturally has extraordinary talent. I would like to see his talent.”

After saying this, she looked at the god testing stone beside her.

This stone was able to measure a person’s talent, and it was extremely mysterious.

“Do you think there will be any top-notch geniuses born here?”The youth beside her couldn’t help but pour a bucket of cold water on her.

The young girl didn’t say much, only looking in Qin Yu’s direction with interest.

Qin Yu didn’t know anything about their remarks.

Of course, Qin Yu was also quite confident in his talent.

To rush to his current realm in such a short time, such speed was probably considered top-notch even in the holy region.

As the selection continued, one contestant after another was fooled.

The conditions of the selection seemed to be extremely harsh. Some of the Martial Marquis realm cultivators were even fooled.

“I wonder what the background of this sect is,”Qin Yu said in a low voice.

Zhen Yue said in a low voice, “In any case, it looks more formal than Lu Guan and the others last time.”

Qin Yu nodded slightly. Lu Guan’s sect didn’t seem powerful last time, and the two people sent here weren’t powerful enough.

Compared to this time’s mighty realm, it was indeed a bit shabby.

“At this speed, I’m afraid it will take a very long time,”Qin Yu muttered.

There was still a long line in front of them. Although the speed of the test was very fast, there were too many people.

When it was Qin Yu and the others’turn, it would probably be night time.

Fortunately, Qin Yu and the others weren’t in a hurry. More than a year had passed, let alone these few days.

Time flew by, and the sky gradually darkened.

As for Qin Yu and the others, they were getting closer and closer to the testing divine stone.

In front of them, there were still around ten people left.

But what was shocking was that in such a large crowd, only three people had been chosen.

This number was undoubtedly shocking.

Such a large ancient star, logically speaking, there should be endless streams of genius paper cups. It was absolutely impossible for them to be so rare.

“Qin Yu, you can go first later.”The higher-ups behind him felt uneasy as they spoke in a low voice.

“That’s right, Mr. Qin. With your talent, you’ll definitely be able to easily enter the selection. At that time, it shouldn’t be a big deal to raise some additional conditions.”

“Mr. Qin, Please!”

These higher-ups begged bitterly, almost kneeling down.

Qin Yu smiled bitterly. “Alright, I’ll line up in front of all of you. If it’s possible, I’ll definitely bring all of you to the Holy Region.”

“Many thanks!”The nearly ten mighty figures all bowed.

The crowd in front gradually decreased.

Qin Yu looked at Di Zun and Zhen Yue and said with a smile, “Later, the two of you will go first.”

“Ah?”Hearing these words, Zhen Yue instantly appeared somewhat terrified.

“I... I Can’t do it, right?”

Zhen Yue seemed to have an extremely low self-esteem, and he was filled with dread towards the testing God stone.

“What are you afraid of? It Won’t kill anyone if we test it.”Di Zun seemed to be very relaxed.

He rolled up his sleeves and said, “I’ll go first later!”

Qin Yu smiled and said, “Di Zun is right. There’s nothing to be afraid of. There’s nothing to lose even if we get fooled.”

Zhen Yue mustered up his courage and agreed immediately.

The people in front of them became fewer and fewer, and soon it was Qin Yu’s turn.

The young men in charge of the selection also looked at Qin Yu with interest.

They seemed to want to see how capable Qin Yu was.

“I’ll go first!”Di Zun rolled up his sleeves and walked to the testing God stone.

He raised his hand and placed it on the testing God stone according to his request.

Rays of light shone on the testing God stone. The light pierced through Di Zun’s palm as if it was absorbing his blood.

This kind of test made Qin Yu think of the various instruments in the hospital.

After dozens of seconds, a number appeared on the testing Divine Stone: 93!

Seeing this number, the young men widened their eyes.

“93? How is this possible? Is there a problem?”A young man with long hair said in surprise.

The old men behind him also hurriedly stood up and walked over with shocked expressions.

“Elder, look, this kid actually tested 93,”the long-haired youth said with a frown.

The elder who was called Elder couldn’t help but look at Di Zun with joy, his eyes filled with longing.

“If there wasn’t a problem with the test, this kid would probably be a peerless genius,”the elder said in a low voice.

At this point, the elder looked at the youth and said, “Zi he, test him again.”

The young man called Zihe immediately nodded and said, “Yes, Elder.”
