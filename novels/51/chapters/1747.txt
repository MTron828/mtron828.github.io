Chapter 1748: Wen Wanchong’s Request

He Teng heaved a long sigh of relief. He didn’t dawdle and immediately told his everything that had happened to Qin Yu.

Of course, He Teng did not say a word about the chaotic body. He did not care if Yuan Xiu knew about it, but he kept his mouth shut.

After hearing He Teng’s words, Yuan Xiu snorted and said, “It seems that place of yours is really not simple.”

“You must be joking,” He Teng said with an embarrassed smile. “Even cultivation is difficult there. Otherwise, we wouldn’t have taken such a great risk to rush to the Holy Region...”

Yuan Xiu did not say anything more. He turned around and walked out.

Sima Bei quickly caught up with him, frowning, “Master, when will we go to Nanzhou again?”

“Let’s go and find out more about Nanzhou. The next time we set foot in Nanzhou, we must succeed!” Yuan Xiu said.

As they spoke, the two of them walked out of the room.

After they left, He Teng’s expression instantly turned cold. It was a sharp contrast to the flattery he had just now.

Yong Ji walked over and said, “Aren’t you afraid that the finger just now would really kill you?”

He Teng glanced at him and said with a cold smile, “He won’t do that.”

“Why?” Yong Ji was confused.

He Teng said coldly, “He still has use for me. Besides, if he wanted to kill me, he could have just used the curse he planted in my body. Why did he have to stick out a finger? He’s clearly trying to scare me.”

After saying this, He Teng also turned around and walked out.

Looking at He Teng’s back, Yong Ji didn’t say a word. No one knew what he was thinking.

...

Almost everyone in Nanzhou was talking about this.

Qin Yu had defeated Yuan Xiu twice. To Nanzhou, he was their benefactor.

“I didn’t expect Qin Yu to be the one who defeated Yuan Xiu.”

“Sigh, it’s said that he took an extremely precious pill and has fallen into a coma.”

“I wonder if we’ll be able to survive this next time.”

“Let’s wait and see. It won’t be long before Yuan Xiu make a comeback.”

“I can only hope that Xiao Sheng can reach the Reversion Void Stage before then.”

Inside the Divine Capital City.

Qin Yu was still in a coma.

No one knew how long it would take for him to wake up, and no one knew what kind of injury this Reversion Void Pill would leave on him.

You could only leave but not enter the Divine Capital City, so Qu Zhu and the others didn’t dare to leave the city rashly.

From time to time, they would look at Xiao Sheng, who was at the back of the mountain, as if they were waiting for him to make a breakthrough.

“Tsk, tsk, is the kid sitting at the back of the mountain called Zhuo Jing?” Wen Wanchong asked.

“Mm,” Qu Zhu said. “His father is a well-known figure in Nanzhou.”

“That kid seems to have been in closed-door cultivation for a long time. Qin Yu even gave him the dragon blood.” Wen Wanchong said.

Qu Zhu didn’t reply, but closed his eyes instead.

Naturally, Wen Wanchong did not have the same state of mind as Qu Zhu. He had been walking around the Divine Capital City for the past few days. In just a few days, he had already gone around the entire city.

“If this continues, when will it end? Damn it.” Wen Wanchong couldn’t help but curse.

Wen Wanchong had not drunk for days and could not take it anymore.

Most importantly, his two grandsons were still out there. If they were used by the North Plainers, it would be troublesome.

A few days later.

Wen Wanchong finally couldn’t hold it in anymore.

He walked to Qu Zhu’s side and said in a low voice, “I’m planning to leave this place,”

“Qin Yu said that we can’t leave the Divine Capital City,” Qu Zhu said, frowning.

“If Yuan Xiu comes, will you and I hide in Divine Capital City?” Wen Wanchong asked.

Qu Zhu was instantly rendered speechless.

“Since I have to go out sooner or later, why should I suffer here?” Wen Wanchong said coldly.

“Moreover, the environment here is not suitable for cultivation at all.”

Qu Zhu seemed to think that Wen Wanchong’s words made sense, so he slowly stood up and said, “Then I’ll leave too.”

“Yes, let Peng Liu take good care of Qin Yu.” Wen Wanchong said.

The two of them hit it off and left Divine Capital City that day.

After leaving the Divine Capital City, Wen Wanchong was the first to rush to the Azure Rock Forest. He found Jing Bai and told him about the Reversion Void Pill that Qin Yu had taken.

“What kind of consequences will this Reversion Void Pill bring?” Wen Wanchong frowned.

Jing Bai shook his head. “I don’t know the exact consequences, but they must be very serious.”

Wen Wanchong sighed and said, “If his foundation is affected by this pill, you will be a sinner.”

Jing Bai didn’t dare to say more and could only bow slightly to express his apology.

“Does your Hunter organization have any other treasures that can resist Yuan Xiu?” at this time, Wen Wanchong suddenly changed the topic.

“No,” Jing Bai said with a bitter smile. “If there were any, we wouldn’t have stayed in the Azure Rock Forest.”

“Alright then,” Wen Wanchong sighed and said.

Wen Wanchong left the Hunter organization and returned to Dayue Mountain.

In the blink of an eye, eight days had passed since the last battle.

It seemed like it was getting closer and closer to Xiao Sheng’s seclusion.

On this day.

There were many Reversion Void Stage cultivators gathered on Dayue Mountain.

Wen Wanchong gathered all the Reversion Void Stage cultivators he could contact to discuss how to deal with Yuan Xiu.

On the peak of Dayue Mountain, Wen Wanchong looked like a general.

Jue Wu sat beside him, eating and drinking like a child.

“It’s Jue Wu. didn’t something happen to Jue Wu?” 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“Why is she here at Dayue Mountain? That’s strange, could she have been staying in Dayue Mountain all this time?”

“If Jue Wu is still alive, then there’s still some hope for that battle.”

“There’s no hope. Look at Jue Wu’s current state. She’s only a half-step Reversion Void Stage cultivator. She doesn’t have the prestige she had in the past.”

Wen Wanchong cleared his throat and scanned the crowd, not knowing what to say.

He had never had a gift for giving speeches, and in front of the crowd, he didn’t know what to say to incite the crowd.

After a long time, Wen Wanchong raised his glass and said, “I’ll have to trouble everyone to fight Yuan Xiu together!”

When these words were said, the scene was extremely quiet. Not to mention applause, not even a sound could be heard.

“Damn it, don’t you know how to clap? You’re not giving me any face at all!” Jue Wu stood up and clapped while speaking with an unhappy expression.

Seeing Jue Wu stand up, this group of people were obviously a little panicked and subconsciously followed Jue Wu’s lead and clapped.

Obviously, although Jue Wu was only at the half-step Reversion Void Stage, this group of people was still a little afraid of her.

“Then it’s a deal. We’ll go to Divine Capital City together in a few days!” Wen Wanchong said casually.

He raised his glass and downed it.

“I think you guys shouldn’t waste your energy.” At this moment, a cold voice came from the dark.
