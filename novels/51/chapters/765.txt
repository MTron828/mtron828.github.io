Chapter 766: Can You Withstand It a Second Time? Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Landscape painting?

Qin Yu frowned. What landscape painting did he have in his hands?

What he obtained in the coffin was only a painting that looked like a ghost drawing talisman.

However, there was no time to think about it. Blackie’s internal qi was getting stronger and stronger. It could be said that it was earth-shaking.

Faced with this intense killing intent, everyone present gasped.

“Kill him!” Granny Qin shouted excitedly!

“Ah!”

Blackie let out a furious roar. Following that, streams of incomparably pure black energy flew towards Qin Yu!

“Rumble!”

Like a meteorite falling, the ground rumbled.

The powerful pressure caused Qin Yu’s entire body to tremble incessantly!

The people in the distance couldn’t withstand this pressure and instantly knelt on the ground, unable to get up!

“Quickly retreat! Stay away from them!” Someone shouted.

Then, a group of people shot behind them!

That energy came crushing down on Qin Yu!

The power that engulfed the entire area spread throughout the entire space!

“Ah!!!”

Cracks appeared on Qin Yu’s body!

However, under this huge pressure, Qin Yu still didn’t give up!

He quickly put away the bronze sword and clenched his fists. Golden light instantly erupted!

The golden light continued to condense on his fists. A bright light burst out!

One black and one bright, the two forces formed a sharp contrast, like a confrontation between darkness and light!

“Does this kid still want to resist?” Someone exclaimed.

The man with the mustache couldn’t help but grit his teeth and said, “Qin Yu, don’t show off! This isn’t something you can resist!”

“Hmph, with this kind of power, he will definitely die.” Granny Qin grinned, a trace of excitement flashed across her face.

“Ah!!” At this moment, Qin Yu’s mouth let out a hoarse roar!

Following that, the golden light from his entire body gathered on his right fist!

The light from his body faded away, but his fist directly turned into a blazing white color!

“Ah!!”

At this moment, another furious roar sounded! That blazing white fist suddenly had traces of purple embellishment!

“Spiritual fire!” Someone seemed to have recognized that hint of purple!

But this was still not the end. The scarlet color of the divine dragon power seemed to have been extracted and gathered on his right fist!

In just a short moment, Qin Yu’s fist became colorful and dazzling!

“Ah!!!”

Accompanied by Qin Yu’s furious roar, his right fist suddenly smashed out!

“Boom!” Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

The two forces collided violently at this moment!

A terrifying internal qi swept out in all directions like a nuclear bomb explosion!

For a moment, even the void seemed to be trembling, emitting a strange buzzing sound!

“Boom!” After another explosive sound, the surroundings instantly turned into a vast expanse of white!

At a glance, nothing could be seen clearly!

“What’s going on? What happened?” Everyone exclaimed.

“My eyes can’t see anything!”

“Is he dead?”

“Who won and who lost?”

Everyone was unable to see through the scene in front of them, even Granny Qin, man with the mustache, and the others!

“Humph, don’t even think about it. Qin Yu has probably turned into a skeleton!” Granny Qin sneered.

She knew the power of Blackie’s technique very well. It was the true power of a Martial Saint! It was definitely not something Qin Yu could resist!

Finally, the scene in front of them began to slowly appear.

The short period of blindness also began to disappear.

“Who won? Who won?” Everyone said anxiously.

Granny Qin was rather calm. She was certain that Qin Yu would die under this technique!

“Is this the power of a Martial Saint...”

At this moment, Qin Yu’s voice entered everyone’s ears!

Upon hearing this voice, Granny Qin’s pupils suddenly shrank!

“What’s going on?” Granny Qin shouted in shock!

Looking closely, they saw Qin Yu standing there unmoving.

His clothes were almost torn to shreds, but there wasn’t a single scratch on his body!

“Qin Yu... survived...” Someone gulped, as if he couldn’t believe the scene before his eyes.

“That’s the power of a Martial Saint... how did he survive?”

Even Yan Jinyao’s expression was extremely ugly!

If it was him, he would have died by now!

“Qin Yu...” Yan Jinyao couldn’t help but clench his fists!

“Little bastard... he’s actually not dead!” Granny Qin was even more furious! However, while she was angry, there was also some fear in her heart.

One had to know that the current Qin Yu was only at the late stage of the Martial Marquis Realm! He had not even stepped into the peak of the Martial Marquis Realm!

With his current realm, he was able to withstand a spell that contained the power of a Martial Saint. If this kid were to step into the Martial Saint realm, how powerful would he be?

“Qin Yu... You’re really surprising.” Blackie’s voice was also heard.

Traces of blood flowed out from the corner of his mouth. Clearly, Qin Yu had won this battle.

Although he didn’t gain much, Qin Yu had relied on his own strength to defeat the power bestowed by the eight higher-ups.

Blackie wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth and a trace of a cruel smile appeared on his face.

He raised his palm, and that power appeared again!

“Again?!”

“Damn... Blackie can actually use it a second time?”

“How should Qin Yu deal with it?”

That power was brewing in Blackie’s hand again.

He opened his mouth, revealing a mouthful of white teeth, and sneered. “Your punch just now hurt me very much, but I don’t believe that you can use it a second time.”

Qin Yu smiled bitterly.

He had been thinking hard for the past few days to come up with this punch. He didn’t even have the time to name it.

This punch was naturally extremely powerful, but its weakness was that it could only hit once. It definitely didn’t have the strength to hit a second time.

“The power of a Martial Saint really lives up to its reputation.” Qin Yu sighed slightly.

“Qin Yu! Hurry up and use that picture!” The man with the mustache shouted.

Qin Yu took a glance at the man with the mustache. He took a deep breath and nodded. “This is the only way.”

Although Qin Yu didn’t have much confidence in that picture, this might be the only chance now.

Not far away, the energy in Blackie’s hand was still condensing, and the ground was rumbling.

“Qin Yu, go to hell!” Blackie’s face was filled with madness as he roared!

Following that, he threw his palm fiercely towards Qin Yu!

“Rumble...”

This force once again forced everyone back!

Looking at this force, Qin Yu gritted his teeth. He took out the painting of the masked woman.

“I hope there will be a miracle,” Qin Yu said in a deep voice.

Following that, Qin Yu threw this painting out fiercely!
