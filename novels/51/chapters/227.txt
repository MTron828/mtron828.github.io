Chapter 228: Escape Once Again Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Jiang Gu’s internal qi became heavier and heavier, and a sense of pressure pressed down on him.

Qin Yu’s expression was somewhat solemn.

Jiang Gu was an Inner Strength Grandmaster after all, and his strength couldn’t be underestimated.

If he attacked him, Qin Yu would probably die here as well.

“Rumble...”

Jiang Gu waved his palm while pressing towards Qin Yu!

“Mr. Qin!”

At this moment, a loud shout came from outside!

He turned around and saw Yao Qing standing at the door while panting.

He was holding a person in his hand.

This person was none other than Jiang Yu!

Jiang Gu laid in Yao Qing’s arms without moving, and he appeared to be dead.

“Son!” The moment he saw Jiang Yu, Jiang Gu immediately pounced over!

He hugged Jiang Yu and said anxiously, “Son, you... what happened to you...”

Qin Yu heaved a sigh of relief.

He had long guessed that there was something fishy going on, so he had investigated the situation of the Jiang family in advance.

Then, he came to the Jiang family ahead of time and took a strand of Jiang Yu’s hair. Using the method he used to find Yan Ruoxue, he found Jiang Yu’s location.

Then, he asked Yao Qing to find Jiang Yu, while he came to attend the banquet alone.

“Fortunately, you made it in time.” Qin Yu was a little scared.

With that slap from Jiang Gu, Qin Yu would definitely have died!

“Qin Yu, how did you find Jiang Yu?!” Hui Ming stared at Qin Yu and his eyes were full of resentment.

Qin Yu sneered. “Do you think it has anything to do with you?”

Not far away, Jiang Gu was still hugging Jiang Yu’s body.

What made him miserable was that he found that Jiang Yu was no longer breathing.

“Hui Ming, how dare you lie to me?! I’m going to kill you!!” Jiang Gu raised his head and roared angrily. The force of grief and indignation shook the house until it collapsed!

After feeling this terrifying killing intent, Hui Ming’s expression suddenly changed!

“Oh no, with my current state, I have no way of retaliating!” Hui Ming secretly thought.

“D*mn it, Qin Yu, you better remember this, I will kill you sooner or later!”

At this critical moment, Hui Ming left Tao Shan’s body before turning into a streak of black energy and leaving!

“Stop!”

Qin Yu hurriedly shouted!

But it was too late!

Jiang Gu, who was blinded by anger, only wanted to slap Hui Ming to death!

But the person in front of him was no longer Hui Ming, but Tao Shan!

In a moment of desperation, Qin Yu gritted his teeth. He blocked in front of Tao Shan!

“Level two of the Saintly Body Technique!” Qin Yu roared and hurriedly activated the spell!

His body instantly turned golden! He forcefully withstood this attack with his physical body!

“Boom!”

The terrifying force smashed onto Qin Yu’s body!

A large area of the ground where Qin Yu was standing immediately sank, and dust flew up, obscuring everyone’s vision!

“Mr. Qin!” Yao Qing immediately panicked and ran over in a hurry!

Even Qin Yu couldn’t withstand this attack.

The golden color on his body was cracked, and fresh blood almost covered his entire face.

“Mr. Qin!” Yao Qing panicked. He hugged Qin Yu’s body and roared crazily.

“What are you shouting for... I’m not dead yet...” Just when Yao Qing was in grief and indignation, Qin Yu suddenly got up from the ground.

His body was a little unstable. Obviously, Qin Yu was also seriously injured by this attack.

“Are... are you okay?” Yao Qing asked in a panic.

Qin Yu waved his hand. Then, he shook his body with difficulty and walked toward Jiang Gu.

“Why did you stop me?!” Jiang Gu glared at Qin Yu with fury in his eyes!

Qin Yu waved his hand and said, “Hui Ming has already run away. This body now belongs to a tough man called Tao Shan...”

Jiang Gu roared angrily, “I want to go to the southwest. I want to destroy the Earth Fiend Valley!”

“Don’t worry...” Qin Yu waved his hand.

He walked to Jiang Yu and put his hand on Jiang Gu’s chest.

Qin Yu injected the last trace of spiritual energy in his body to Jiang Yu’s body.

Then, he raised his other hand and put it on Jiang Yu’s forehead.

Wisps of dark energy were absorbed by Jiang Yu’s body.

A moment later, Jiang Yu, who was lying lifeless on the ground, suddenly coughed!

When he heard this cough, ecstasy flashed across Jiang Gu’s face!

“Son!” Jiang Gu ran over and hugged Jiang Yu. His face, which was full of wrinkles, was instantly covered with tears!

At this time, Qin Yu was already out of strength. He muttered in a low voice, “Fortunately, he was saved in time. Otherwise, I’m afraid he would have died...”

After saying this, Qin Yu fell heavily to the ground!

“Mr. Qin!” Yao Qing immediately shouted!

“Jiang Gu, it’s all your fault. You almost killed Mr. Qin!” Yao Qing looked at Jiang Gu with hatred.

Jiang Gu turned around and knelt toward Qin Yu with a plop.

“Mr. Qin, thank you for saving my son... from today onwards, I will obey your orders!” Jiang Gu cried.

If the reason why he submitted to Qin Yu before was because of fear, now, it was because of admiration and respect.

Qin Yu laid on the bed for an entire night.

It wasn’t until the next morning that his body gradually recovered.

“Phew!”

The next day, Qin Yu jumped up from the huge bed.

He moved his body and felt that his entire body was sore.

“Jiang Gu’s attack... really nearly killed me,” Qin Yu muttered.

Soon, Jiang Gu walked in with Jiang Yu.

“Mr. Qin, you’re awake,” Jiang Gu bowed and said.

Qin Yu rolled his eyes and said, “I almost couldn’t wake up.”

Jiang Gu couldn’t help but feel a little guilty. He immediately bowed to Qin Yu again and again.

Then, Jiang Gu looked at Jiang Yu and scolded, “Hurry up and thank your savior!”

Jiang Yu glared at Qin Yu and said with some dissatisfaction, “Thank you.”

“Speak nicely!” Jiang Gu scolded.

Qin Yu waved his hand and said, “Forget it. It’s no big deal. Don’t take it to heart.”

Jiang Gu opened his mouth, but didn’t know what to say.

“If there’s nothing else, I’ll go back first.” Qin Yu got up from the bed and said.

Jiang Gu hurriedly asked, “Are you leaving already?”

“Yes, my time is precious. I can’t be delayed,” Qin Yu muttered.

Jiang Gu had no choice but to send Qin Yu away from the provincial capital.

At this point, Qin Yu suddenly thought of something.

He turned around and glanced at Jiang Gu while smiling. “One day, I will personally destroy the Earth Fiend Valley.”

After saying this, Qin Yu turned around and left.

He originally wanted to go to Bai City, but on second thought, he decided to return to Jiangcheng first.

After all, that place was his hometown, and he really felt a sense of belonging.

The car sped along the road and soon arrived at Jiangcheng.

And today, an uninvited guest had arrived at the entrance of the Dragon Paradise Villa.

A Maybach sedan was parked at the entrance. The Jingdu license plate showed that the visitor was of extraordinary status. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

A young man broke open the door of the villa and walked into Qin Yu’s house.

He acted as if no one was there, as if he was the owner of the house.

The young man stood in Qin Yu’s bedroom.

He raised his head and looked at the group photo that was plastered all over the wall. His expression became colder.
