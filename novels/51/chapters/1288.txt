Chapter 1289: Chapter 1,289, leaving the Hunter organization 

Although Jin Lun was furious, he knew that he could not defend himself now.

If other hunters arrived, he would probably die here!

Thinking of this, Jin Lun gritted his teeth, smashed the ceiling, and left quickly.

Zhong Wu did not chase after him, but sneered in his heart.

Jin Lun’s escape was the best choice for Zhong Wu, so no one would suspect him.

As for the “Scapegoat”, it was Zhong Wu who specially found him to testify.

“Jin Lun, you want to be the team leader? In your dreams!”Zhong wu sneered.

He walked to the team leader and put the bone club into his bag.

As long as he had this item, he could control the hunter organization.

The group leader’s corpse was still lying on the ground. Many hunters quickly came after hearing the news.

Qin Yu, Guan Zhuang, and Jing Bai also rushed in.

When he saw the group leader’s corpse, Qin Yu’s expression immediately changed!

He quickly ran in front of the group leader and said coldly, “Who did this?”

“It was Jin Lun! I saw him kill the team leader with my own eyes!”The young man said angrily.

Zhong Wu also nodded and said, “That’s right, it was Jin Lun who killed the team leader.”

“Where is Jin Lun? !”Guan Zhuang was instantly filled with grief and indignation as he roared angrily.

“He has already escaped,”Zhong Wu said in a deep voice.

“I really didn’t expect that this Jin Lun would actually kill the team leader.”

For a moment, many hunters cried out in pain.

They knelt in front of the team leader in grief.

The team leader treated every hunter very well, and his reputation among the hunters was also very high.

Now that he was dead, how could everyone not be in pain.

Qin Yu lowered his head to look at the team leader who was lying on the ground, and his fists were clenched tightly.

He knew clearly in his heart that this was definitely instigated by the Tianyun sect!

“Group leader... died because of me...”Qin Yu gritted his teeth and clenched his fists tightly.

“Heavenly Cloud sect, I will definitely not let you off! ! !”

He never thought that the heavenly cloud sect would directly send people to get rid of the group leader!

“We must capture Jin Lun and avenge the group leader!”The other hunters also roared angrily.

They did not have the ability to declare war with the heavenly cloud sect, so they could only vent their anger on Jin Lun.

At this time, Jing Bai said coldly, “How did he get rid of the team leader silently?”

“It’s because of that bowl of soup.”Zhong wu pointed at the empty bowl on the table and said.

“Jin Lun must have poisoned it.”

Jing Bai hurried to the table and picked up the bowl on the table to smell it.

At this time, Qin Yu sensed that something was wrong.

Since it was done by Jin Lun, what was his purpose?

If it was just to escape, why did he have to get rid of the team leader?

Could it be that the Tianyun sect had given him some benefits? Or was it a promise?

Qin Yu glanced at Zhong Wu who was not far away. He suddenly felt that this matter was probably related to Zhong Wu.

“You were the first to discover it?”Qin Yu looked at Zhong Wu.

Zhong wu nodded slightly and said, “That’s right.”

Qin Yu said with a dark face, “The team leader just died, and you appeared here?”

“Why? I wanted to report the problem to the team leader, but I just happened to run into it. is that not possible?”Zhong Wu did not panic at all.

This matter had nothing to do with him directly, so he was not afraid.

“As for you, you should be clear about the reason for the team leader’s death, right?”Zhong Wu said with a cold smile.

“If it weren’t for you, would the Heavenly Cloud sect have come? Would the team leader have died? You Jinx, you still dare to speak?”

Qin Yu frowned slightly.

Although Zhong Wu wasn’t a good person, there was nothing wrong with what he said.

“In order to prevent accidents, Qin Yu, you’d better scram quickly and leave the hunter organization,”Zhong Wu said with a faint smile.

“Otherwise, I’m afraid it will implicate our entire hunter organization.”

“No!”Jing Bai immediately stood up to oppose.

“The team leader said that we can’t give up on anyone. This is the bottom line of the team leader.”

Zhong wu sneered and said, “Since the team leader is dead, the rules he set have long been broken.”

“Moreover, don’t tell me that we have to sacrifice more people because of Qin Yu?”

Jing bai coldly said, “The team leader’s corpse is not even cold yet, yet you say such words. Are you even human?”

“Hehe, I’m thinking about reality. If it really doesn’t work, then let’s vote on it.”Zhong wu snorted.

After saying that, he shouted, “Those who agree to let Qin Yu leave raise their hands!”

About half of the people present raised their hands, while the other half didn’t agree.

Zhong wu snorted and said, “Qin Yu, hurry up and scram. This matter is settled.”

“It’s not up to you,”Jing Bai berated coldly.

At this moment, Zhong Wu’s eyes narrowed slightly. He suddenly stretched out his hand, and the bone staff immediately appeared in his hand.

“Then does it count if it’s up to you?”Zhong wu asked coldly.

Jing Bai’s expression changed, and he berated, “Why is the bone staff in Your Hand?”

Zhong wu snorted lightly and said, “Since the team leader is dead, I naturally have to hold the bone staff firmly in my hand to prevent it from being taken away by the treacherous people.”

“Also, I remember that the hunter organization has a rule, right? Whoever gets the bone staff will be the new leader, right?”

Jing Bai opened his mouth and was instantly speechless.

The hunter organization indeed had such a rule, but this rule was also set by the leader.

“Just now, you said that the leader’s rule was nullified, and now you F * cking brought out the rule. Why, you just say whatever is beneficial to you, right?”Guan Zhuang could not help but scold.

Zhong wu snorted coldly and said, “Cut the crap. Anyway, the big white bone club is in my hands now. This position should be mine!”

Guan Zhuang was about to speak when Qin Yu stretched out his hand to stop Guan Zhuang.

He shook his head and said, “Forget it. I’ll just leave the Hunter Organization.”

“Qin Yu, absolutely not. The people from the Heavenly Cloud sect are nearby. Once you leave, they will definitely attack you immediately!”Jing Bai said anxiously.

Qin Yu smiled bitterly and said, “It doesn’t matter. He and I will have a fight sooner or later.”

“It’s settled then. There’s no need to say anything more. I will leave the hunter organization now.” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

After saying that, Qin Yu looked at the group leader.

He bowed three times to the corpse, then turned around and walked out.
