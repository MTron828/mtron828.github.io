Chapter 317: Heading to the Yan Family Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

This punch looked simple, and there wasn’thing special about it. It was purely the power of his physical body!

Lu Chen was instantly overjoyed. He roared angrily, “You don’t know what inner strength is!”

However, Qin Yu sneered and said, “It’s you who doesn’t know what physical strength is.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Qin Yu’s fist smashed onto Lu Chen’s body!

A shocking thing happened. With this punch, Lu Chen’s body flew out of the training ground like a kite with a short string while heading straight for the grandstand!

“Boom!”

In the end, Lu Chen’s body landed on the grandstand before smashing the grandstand into pieces!

And he happened to land right next to Ye Qing.

The crowd was in an uproar! No one dared to believe this scene!

An Inner Strength Past Master crushed an Inner Strength Grandmaster with just his physical strength?

How was this possible?

“Hahahaha, Mr. Sun, it seems that you are the last place this year, hahaha!” Commander Long laughed so hard that he couldn’t close his mouth!

Mr. Sun’s expression was livid. He stood up angrily and said through gritted teeth, “Trash!”

Lu Chen had lasted less than a minute on the stage before he was sent flying.

If that was the case, the Chuzhou region’s score would probably be ridiculously high.

“What’s Qin Yu background?”

“His strength is a little shocking.”

“No one would have thought that the Chuzhou region would turn things around this year.”

Everyone looked at Qin Yu. Ye Qing, who had been meditating, finally opened his eyes slowly.

He looked in Qin Yu’s direction. His deep and mysterious gaze made it impossible to see through him.

Qin Yu didn’t flinch. He maintained eye contact.

Their eyes met, and everything seemed to freeze.

In the end, Qin Yu bowed to Ye Qing and walked down the stage.

“After this fight, let’s call it a day.” Qin Yu yawned.

Many members of the Longhu team immediately surrounded him.

“Mr. Qin, you are too fierce! How did you throw that punch?!”

“What great power! Mr. Qin, you are our idol!”

When he was facing the cheers of the crowd, a smile appeared on Qin Yu’s face.

Ever since he swallowed the inner core that Fang Yue had given him, a strange force had appeared on Qin Yu’s body.

This strange force was perfectly compatible with Qin Yu’s physical body, and it displayed unimaginable power!

“Qin Yu, well done! Come and sit here!” On the stage, Commander Long gave Qin Yu a thumbs up.

Qin Yu slowly walked to Commander Long’s side and sat down.

“Qin Yu, you really live up to your reputation as the King of Chuzhou!” Commander Long, his face beaming with joy, burst into laughter.

“Commander Long, I should be free from now on, right?” Qin Yu asked.

Commander Long smiled and said, “Just wait for the score to come out. As long as our scores are high enough, we will advance to the finals.”

“In other words, we will get second place! Your task will be completed!”

Qin Yu nodded and didn’t say anything more.

On the stage, many judges began to grade.

All of them were waiting. They also wanted to know what kind of score would be given by such an astonishing battle result.

“After the judges gave a unanimous rating, the score of the Chuzhou region is 100 points!” At this time, the host said.

“Because they broke the grandstand, one point was deducted! The final score is 99 points!”

Commander Long immediately burst into laughter.

“Qin Yu, you really are the hero of the Chuzhou region!” Commander Long kept patting Qin Yu’s shoulder.

Qin Yu asked in puzzlement, “Commander Long, how many points did we get last year?”

Commander Long blushed and said, “Don’t ask. Why do you ask so many questions?”

Someone beside him laughed and said, “Last year, it was 38 points. Mr. Long, are you ashamed?”

“Screw you!” Commander Long almost blushed.

Qin Yu stood up and said, “Commander Long, I should be done here, right?”

Commander Long nodded and said, “99 points is enough to enter the finals. There’s nothing else for you to do today. Just wait for the finals to start tomorrow.”

“Okay, then I’ll take my leave first,” said Qin Yu.

“Where are you going?” Commander Long hurriedly asked.

Qin Yu didn’t answer, but his face was brimming with a smile.

After Qin Yu walked out of the Jingdu Military District, Yao Qing was waiting at the door.

When he saw Qin Yu, he hurriedly walked up and asked, “How was it?”

Qin Yu waved his hand and said, “In short, we can leave first.”

“Leave first? Where to?” Yao Qing asked in puzzlement.

Qin Yu took a deep breath and suppressed the excitement inside. He said, “To the Yan family’s home.”

The Yan family’s home was located in a manor.

In Jingdu, where every inch of land was precious, the Yan family had an extremely large manor.

This place was heavily guarded. Even the security guards at the entrance were Inner Strength Past Masters.

What was even more shocking was that the entire villa was made of bulletproof materials.

It wasn’t difficult to find the address of the Yan family, one of the largest aristocratic families in Jingdu.

After Qin Yu obtained the address of the Yan family, he took a taxi and rushed to the Yan family.

Along the way, Qin Yu was extremely excited.

His heart was beating wildly. The thought of seeing Yan Ruoxue soon made Qin Yu extremely exhilarated.

After more than an hour, they finally arrived at the entrance of the Yan family’s manor.

“Alright, I’ll send you here. I’m not allowed to enter any further,” said the driver.

Qin Yu said, “Thank you.”

After getting out of the car, Qin Yu looked up at the huge manor.

Rather than a villa, it was more like a castle.

As far as the eye could see, there was no end to it.

“It’s so grand...” Yao Qing gulped and said in a low voice.

Qin Yu took a deep breath and tried his best to remain calm as he walked towards the Yan family’s manor.

“Stop!”

Very quickly, the security guards at the door noticed Qin Yu.

The two of them quickly walked forward and blocked Qin Yu’s path.

“You are not allowed to enter the Yan family’s manor without an invitation,” the security guard said coldly.

Qin Yu let out a deep breath and said somewhat excitedly, “Can you help me inform her? I want to see Miss Yan.”

“Miss Yan? Which Miss Yan?” The security guard asked with a cold expression.

Qin Yu frowned slightly. It seemed that the Yan family had quite a few children.

But to think about it, it made sense. A top aristocratic family like the Yan family had many branches.

“I want to see Miss Yan Ruoxue,” Qin Yu said.

“You want to see Miss Yan?” The bodyguard’s attitude became less hostile.

“Do you have an appointment?” The bodyguard continued to ask.

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “No, can you help me inform her? Tell her that my name is Qin Yu.”

“Qin Yu?” The bodyguard frowned. This name seemed rather unfamiliar to him.

Although he could not go near her without an appointment, the bodyguard was afraid that he would delay Miss Yan’s official business. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Thus, the bodyguard said, “Wait here for a while. I will inform her.”
