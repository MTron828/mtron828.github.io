Chapter 2724: Memories Change

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

“And I have to tell you something. You used the Soul Suppression Ring to escape the attack of Eight Trigrams’ Kun Peng. In addition to what happened before, many people will think that you are the mastermind behind this if they were to investigate. This also means that you will almost encounter the people

I mentioned.”

Meng Jing spoke again. “Come on! If I can’t avoid them, then let’s fight!” Qin Yu clenched his fists.

In this Saint Kingdom, there was no lack of geniuses.

Only through constant training in life-and-death situations could one have the opportunity to break through continuously.

It was just like how he had comprehended the power of the Dao of Dreams when he was in despair in the Nineteenth Prison Summoning Formation.

His current strength was still too weak! Only by constantly experiencing this kind of life-and-death situation would he have the opportunity to improve rapidly.

“Meng Jing, what’s wrong with you today? Why are you so strange?”

Qin Yu asked carefully.

This person seemed to be a different person from the previous Meng Jing who wanted to kill him. He was not used to it.

“Nothing. This is the first time I’ve talked to someone for so long in so many years. It feels pretty good.”

She suddenly smiled.

“Why do I feel like you’re saying your last words?” Qin Yu panicked for no reason.

Meng Jing lowered her head and did not reply to Qin Yu.

“Haven’t you chatted with anyone before? I don’t think you’re social phobia in the Endless Mine.”

Qin Yu was curious.

“I sealed my ‘mind’ here, in this room.”

Meng Jing looked at Qin Yu and said. She suddenly thought of something and her expression became a little unnatural.

“Why are you doing this?”

Qin Yu felt a sudden murderous intent and quickly changed the topic.

“My existence is born from the cosmic luck of this world. Emotions will only affect my strength. This is what grandfather told me.”

“But aren’t people like zombies without emotions?”

Qin Yu said with a frown. He disagreed with the Dao Mystical Saint’s point of view.

“Grandpa is right. I’ve grown up from a weak girl to the number one person after Grandpa very quickly. When I gain great power, I will inevitably lose something. Grandpa is the same, and so am I.”

Meng Jing chuckled.

The Dao Mystical Saint has passed away. How will it affect you?”

After chatting for a while, Qin Yu gradually relaxed.

“My power has already begun to weaken. Perhaps I will disappear in the future. After all, I have occupied a portion of the cosmic luck. No one can take this portion of cosmic luck away if I’m alive.”

Qin Yu was silent when he heard this. When this girl talked about this, it was as if she was telling someone else’s story.

Her state made him feel sorry for her, but Qin Yu could not interfere at his level.

The girl’s innocence had been taken away from the moment she was born.

She could only leave this Saint Kingdom with extreme rationality and emotions. She would have a chance to be herself only when she returned to this small house.

This was Meng Jing’s life. Qin Yu suddenly understood her behavior.

“Meng Jing, do you want to see the world I was born in? There’s no holy energy there, but it’s very prosperous.” nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Qin Yu suddenly grabbed Meng Jing’s hand, and the Night Qi spread to her soft palm.

Meng Jing’s body suddenly tensed up, but she soon relaxed.

She seemed to have an inexplicable trust in Qin Yu.

At this moment, the Seal of Heaven Returning on Qin Yu’s body was slowly emitting an invisible power that resonated with Meng Jing’s power.

When they reappeared, they were already on a busy street.

An auntie was selling sugar figurines and an old man was carrying candied hawthorn.

“Hahaha! It’s my turn to chase after you!”

A girl with two cute braids passed through their bodies and chased after a group of children.

“What kind of cat is this? Can I touch it, old granny?”

Meng Jing asked timidly at a stall selling pet cats. At this moment, she seemed like a girl who went out for the first time.

“This is the Devon Rex. Girl, you can hug her. It doesn’t bite.” The granny smiled kindly and placed the kitten in Meng Jing’s hand.

“Sister, you’re so beautiful.”

Beside the old lady, a girl stared at Meng Jing curiously and held her hand.

“Thank you. Thank you.”

Meng Jing was a little nervous. It was the first time she had such an intimate interaction with someone else.

Qin Yu’s eyes flashed with the power of the night. This was the street where he lived when he was young.

They shouldn’t have appeared here. The people here shouldn’t have seen them either.

However, Qin Yu could not help but use the Night Qi to control these memories seeing Meng Jing’s careful appearance.

It would allow Meng Jing to experience the human world better.

The two of them walked through dozens of streets. Meng Jing, who had been shy, began to talk to people.

She ate different snacks and ran around like a little girl.

She held many strange toys in her hands. Qin Yu was looking at her from behind.

Qin Yu’s body trembled slightly.

This place did not belong to them. The more changes he made, the consumption of the Night Qi would increase exponentially.

He was already beginning to feel the strain. An indescribable change began to appear in his sea of consciousness.

Qin Yu seemed to have grasped something but could not understand the main point.

The dream scene in front of him blurred. He had once brought Jun Yixian into the One Thought Reincarnation.

He had spent a long time there. However, he was still a passerby.

At this moment, this place gave Qin Yu another feeling that he was a part of this place.

He should have stopped here. He seemed to have seen a little boy.

He stared timidly at the stall selling meat buns but he had no money.

“Uncle will buy you some buns.”

Qin Yu saw himself and his voice was a little choked.

He didn’t realize that he could only see him at the moment. The world in the distance had already turned into countless square fragments.

Qin Yu did not notice that the little boy’s eyes also flashed with a dark look.

Just as Qin Yu was about to hold the little boy’s hand, a hand suddenly grabbed

Qin Yu.

“We should go now.”

Meng Jing’s voice made the darkness in Qin Yu’s eyes slowly fade away.

The two of them slowly turned transparent and finally returned to the small house.

Qin Yu was covered in cold sweat. This was the first time he had tried to change himself in the memories of his divine soul.

However, something seemed to have happened. If he had pulled the little boy just now, it was likely that he would stay in that memory forever.

Meng Jing sat beside the bonfire with her hands supporting her chin. No one knew what she was thinking.

She maintained this position for the entire night.

Qin Yu didn’t stay idle either. He took this opportunity to absorb the Saint Crystal’s energy once more.

Once again, he filled up the Night Qi. This was his most powerful method now. He needed to ensure that he was in his perfect state at all times.

This time, the fist-sized Night Qi grew a few more strands after he recovered..
