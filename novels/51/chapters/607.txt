Chapter 608: Father, Is That You?! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Yan Guiyi cast a spell and blocked Qin Yu’s path!

Qin Yu roared, “Yan Guiyi, f*ck you!

He clenched his golden fist and tried to force his way out.

However, Yan Guiyi took out his Black Ball Magic Artifact, leaving Qin Yu powerless to deal with it!

The door was about to close. In such a short time, it was almost impossible for Qin Yu to rush out!

Qin Yu’s expression was extremely ugly. He gritted his teeth, grabbed Chang Mang with one hand, and threw him out!

Just as Qin Yu threw Chang Mang out, the door was completely closed, and not even a single crack was left.

Seeing this, Yan Gui couldn’t help but laugh out loud. “Qin Yu, just wait for your death inside!”

Everyone’s expressions were a little ugly. They didn’t expect that Qin Yu would actually be locked inside.

“If... It wasn’t for the sake of saving Chang Mang, Qin Yu wouldn’t have been locked inside,” someone whispered.

“I really didn’t expect that Qin Yu would be willing to sacrifice himself for Chang Mang.”

For a moment, everyone was moved.

Yao Meng opened her mouth but didn’t say anything.

“I hope... Mr. Qin can survive,” someone whispered.

Yan Guiyi sneered and said, “Stop daydreaming. The killing formation of the Immortal Slaying Sect was set up by a Mighty Realm powerhouse at the very least. Just a wisp of the internal qi can kill a person!”

“Do you think it’s possible for him to survive in such an environment?”

These words immediately made everyone feel dejected.

No one had expected such an outcome in the end.

“Alright, Qin Yu is already dead. It’s your turn next.” Yan Guiyi changed the topic and sneered again and again.

This time, all the bottom-class martial artists were no longer filled with fear.

They stared coldly at Yan Guiyi and said in a cold voice, “Yan Guiyi, you’re just a beast. At worst, we’ll fight it out with you!”

“For the sake of his buddy, Qin Yu can sacrifice his own life. What about you?”

“Yan Guiyi, if you want to kill us, it won’t be that easy!”

When he heard the angry roars of the crowd, Yan Guiyi’s expression turned even colder.

He played with the two black and gold balls in his hands and said coldly, “Fine, then I’ll send you ants to your deaths!”

“Captain Yan.” At this time, Yao Meng suddenly stood up.

“Qin Yu has already died because of you. It’s enough. There’s no need to kill them too, right?”

Yan Guiyi said coldly, “Miss Yao, I hope you don’t say anything more about this matter.”

“I think what Miss Yao said makes sense.” At this time, Chu Hedao also stood up.

“Yes, Captain Yan. Qin Yu’s death is enough.”

This made Yan Guiyi frown.

He glanced at everyone and said coldly, “Is that what you all want?”

“They’re just a bunch of ants. Their life and death have nothing to do with me,” Yan Jinyao snorted lightly.

“Captain Yan, you can do whatever you want. Kill them if you want to, and let them live if you don’t want to. Why would we care about their lives?” Another young master sneered.

Yan Guiyi frowned.

He thought for a moment and snorted coldly. “Fine. For the sake of Yao Meng and Chu Hedao, I’ll spare your lives. Get lost!”

Everyone gritted their teeth. Although they were filled with anger, they knew that they were no match for Yan Guiyi.

Thus, they picked up Chang Mang and turned to leave.

“Alright, the inner cores here belong to all of you.” Yan Guiyi waved his hand and pointed at the inner cores attached to the island.

The young masters of the aristocratic families didn’t stand on ceremony and immediately began to collect the inner cores.

Only Yao Meng stood there without moving an inch. She muttered in a low voice, “I finally know why Ruoxue likes you...”

...

Within the Immortal Slaying Sect, streams of murderous internal qi continued to descend.

Qin Yu dodged from side to side to avoid these streams of murderous internal qi.

However, this killing array was set up by a Mighty Realm powerhouse after all. Even if Qin Yu used the Shrinking Ground Into An Inch technique, he would still be unable to avoid it!

“Platter!!”

A strand of murderous internal qi landed on Qin Yu’s body. This terrifying power easily penetrated Qin Yu’s body!

Blood flowed out from the bloody holes, and his bones were directly shattered!

Qin Yu covered his wound and continued to dodge.

However, this killing formation didn’t seem to have stopped. Streams of murderous internal qi came straight at Qin Yu.

“Platter! Platter! Platter!!”

In just a few short moments, Qin Yu’s body was covered in blood.

Countless bloody holes made Qin Yu look extremely miserable. His physical strength began to wither, and even his speed slowed down.

Qin Yu stared at the gate of the Immortal Slaying Sect and murmured, “Am I going to die here... I’m really unwilling to!”

Qin Yu forced himself to stand in front of the gate to forcefully break it open.

However, the door was indestructible. Qin Yu tried his best, but he was unable to move it at all!

“Platter!!”

Another murderous internal qi pierced through Qin Yu’s abdomen!

That murderous internal qi was only a hair’s breadth away from Qin Yu’s Golden Core!

“Plop!”

Finally, because of the wounds on his body, Qin Yu was unable to bear it anymore.

He knelt on one knee on the ground, and his face was pale.

No matter how strong his willpower was, he couldn’t bear the pain.

“It seems that... I’m really going to die here...” Qin Yu lay weakly on the door with a bitter smile at the corner of his mouth.

It wasn’t easy for him to reach this step, but he didn’t expect this result in the end.

“I... In the end, nothing can change...” Qin Yu muttered in a low voice. He closed his eyes, as if he was waiting for death.

Right in front of him, a strand of murderous internal qi was gathering.

This strand of murderous internal qi was closing in on Qin Yu’s glabella. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

But this time, Qin Yu was already unable to resist.

“Buzz!”

That strand of murderous internal qi rushed towards Qin Yu at this moment!

Qin Yu fell to the ground limply without the slightest bit of resistance.

At this critical moment, Qin Yu’s dantian suddenly flashed with golden light!

Following that, an illusory figure flew out from Qin Yu’s dantian!

This figure was extremely tall, and his back was facing Qin Yu. That imposing figure made people feel a sense of reverence!

One could only see him raise a hand and float towards that strand of murderous internal qi.

“Buzz!”

An explosion sounded out, and that strand of murderous internal qi was actually crushed!

Following that, this illusory figure waved his hand, and waves of collapsing sounds could be heard not far away!

This... This was the sign of the destruction of the killing formation!

With the destruction of the killing formation, the terrifying murderous internal qi also began to dissipate.

Qin Yu stared blankly at the back of the shadow as he said in a trembling voice, “Are... are you my father?”

The shadow didn’t speak for a long time. He only had his back facing Qin Yu.

His imposing figure gave people an indescribable sense of security.

“Father, is that you?!” Qin Yu shouted again.

Finally, the shadow slowly turned around.
