Upon hearing this, everyone was shocked!

Many of the guests asked excitedly, “Mr. Wu, is what you said true?”

“Of course, I, Wu Hongchang, am a man of my word!” Wu Hongchang said with a nonchalant smile.

“Gee, an Inner Strength Master Hands? This is a great opportunity!”

“As expected of Mr. Wu. If there is a chance, please help me too!”

These people looked extremely excited. To them, becoming an Inner Strength Master Hands seemed very difficult.

Even Lu Shuming whispered to Qin Yu, “Qin Yu, if you become an Inner Strength Master Hands, then Liu Shihui definitely won’t be your match!”

“You should know that Mr. Wu hasn’t accepted any disciples in a long time. Why don’t you thank Mr. Wu quickly?!”

The crowd seemed to have decided that this was a golden opportunity for Qin Yu, but Qin Yu just sat there and sneered.

To them, an Inner Strength Master Hands was an unreachable level, but to Qin Yu, this wasn’t even a start.

Moreover, Wu Hongchang seemed very full of himself, which was annoying.

“I don’t think it’s necessary.” Qin Yu tried his best to be polite and said.

Wu Hongchang was stunned. He scratched his ears, as if he couldn’t believe what he had just heard.

“Qin Yu, are you out of your mind? Becoming Mr. Wu’s disciple is definitely a great opportunity for you!” Lu Shuming said with some excitement.

Qin Yu glanced at him and said indifferently, “An Inner Strength Master Hands is nothing to me.”

Upon hearing Qin Yu’s words, everyone instantly fell into silence.

Wu Hongchang said with a bit of displeasure, “Young man, don’t be too arrogant. Do you know how many people are stuck at the peak of Inner Strength and unable to advance at all?”

Qin Yu glanced at Wu Hongchang and said, “I am indeed thirty years old, but I have only stepped into the path of cultivation for less than a month.”

“As for an Inner Strength Master Hands, that’s beneath mentioning to me!”

Although Qin Yu’s voice wasn’t loud, it was as deafening as a bolt from the blue!

“Keep bragging.” Wu Hongchang couldn’t help but laugh.

“I have been practicing martial arts for half of my life, but I am only at the peak of the Inner Strength Master Hands level. It will take you at least a month to advance to that level.” Wu Hongchang obviously didn’t believe Qin Yu’s words.

Qin Yu didn’t bother to explain to Wu Hongchang. He stood up and said, “Mr. Lu, if there is nothing else, I will leave first.”

After saying this, Qin Yu turned around and walked out of the restaurant.

Lu Shuming hurriedly followed behind him and said politely, “Qin Yu, please don’t take offense. Mr. Wu is older after all. Everyone respects him very much. Moreover, he’s very capable.”

“I know. There’s no need to say anything more.” Qin Yu nodded.

After that, Qin Yu ignored Lu Shuming and turned around to leave.

As for Qin Yu, he didn’t want to waste his breath on these people.

The most important thing now was the Water Dragon Cave.

If there was really something under the Water Dragon Cave, Qin Yu was confident that he could advance to the Foundation Establishment Stage.

After Qin Yu left, Lu Shuming also returned to the dining table.

Everyone in the room was lambasting and cursing Qin Yu.

“Mr. Lu, Qin Yu is a bit too arrogant,” someone said.

Lu Shuming waved his hand and said, “Qin Yu has the backing of the Yan family. He does have the right to be arrogant.”

“Hehe, how many rich kids failed halfway through? With his personality, he’ll be screwed sooner or later. Just wait and see,” Wu Hongchang snorted coldly.

Lu Shuming smiled and didn’t say anything else.

However, Lu Shuming didn’t expect things to come to this point.

After thinking for a moment, Lu Shuming called a subordinate over.

“Go to my office and give that watch to Qin Yu. Also, apologize on my behalf,” Lu Shuming instructed.

“Yes.” The subordinate nodded and left quickly.

...

After Qin Yu left, he returned to the hotel first.

In the hotel, Yao Qing had already woken up. He looked out of the window with worry.

It wasn’t until Qin Yu returned that Yao Qing heaved a sigh of relief.

“Mr. Qin, is everything alright?” Yao Qing asked anxiously.

Qin Yu waved the herbs and contract in his hand and said, “What do you think?”

“Gee, Mr. Qin, you’re so awesome!” Yao Qing couldn’t help but give Qin Yu a thumbs up.

“You’re probably the first person in South City to defeat the Liu family by yourself!”

Qin Yu felt a little smug inside.

He couldn’t help but think that if Yan Ruoxue knew, she would definitely be happy for him.

“Pack up. Let’s go,” Qin Yu said to Yao Qing.

Yao Qing hurriedly asked, “Where are we going?”

“The Water Dragon Cave,” Qin Yu said.

The mysteries of the Water Dragon Cave filled Qin Yu with curiosity. He couldn’t wait to figure it out.

The two pushed the door open and were about to leave.

At this time, they found a young man in a suit standing at the door.

“Mr. Qin, President Lu asked me to come,” the young man said politely.

“Lu Shuming?” Qin Yu frowned slightly.

“What’s the matter?”

The young man hurriedly handed a gift box to Qin Yu and said, “President Lu asked me to give this to you. He has something important to do, so he asked me to apologize on his behalf.”

Qin Yu opened the gift box and took out the watch inside.

This watch was very exquisite and was obviously expensive.

“Okay, please thank Mr. Lu on my behalf.” Qin Yu nodded.

After sending the young man away, Qin Yu and Yao Qing left the place together.

Soon, Qin Yu and Yao Qing arrived at the Water Dragon Cave.

At this time, the Water Dragon Cave was full of tourists. They were soaking in the hot spring while looking extremely content.

“Mr. Qin, do you want to inform Qing Ren?” Yao Qing asked.

Qin Yu glanced around and said, “No need. I’m not a spoiled brat like Liu Shihui is.” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Many tourists came all the way from other places. It was a bit cruel to chase them away just like that.

Then, Qin Yu walked to the vicinity of the Water Dragon Cave.

After taking a deep breath, he jumped into the Water Dragon Cave.

The hot spring here was very shallow, but if one swam forward, the water was extremely deep.

Qin Yu dived into the deep water area. He released his internal qi in an attempt to find something in the Water Dragon Cave.

However, after spending an entire hour searching the entire Water Dragon Cave, Qin Yu found nothing.

What surprised him even more was that the density of spiritual energy in every part of the Water Dragon Cave was almost the same.

This baffled Qin Yu. If there was something hidden under the water, the density of the internal qi would definitely be different.

“Weird.” Qin Yu rose out of the water.

He sat by the water’s edge and fell into deep thought.

Looking at the people bathing in the water, Qin Yu suddenly patted his head and his eyes instantly lit up!

“I see now!” Qin Yu stood up with some surprise!
