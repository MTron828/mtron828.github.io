Chapter 1092: Chapter 1,092, the reclusive martial saint 

Rays of light were emitted from the bodies of the eight people.

The light covered the rocks and exploded with a sky-high brilliance.

Just as they had expected, this seal would be completely lifted in a month’s time. At that time, they would be able to enter and exit the first mystery dimension at will and would no longer need to rely on divine sense to descend.

...

In the second mystic realm.

In a secret chamber, a jar was placed in front of Qin Yu.

Threads of white internal Qi floated out of the jar.

The internal Qi was extremely weak, but the power contained within was beyond imagination.

This was the purest form of divine sense power! Under the secret arts of the immortal slaying sect, this power became the spiritual power of cultivation.

Qin Yu closed his eyes slightly. The pores all over his body opened. As he breathed and breathed exercise, this white qi entered his body through his pores.

The moment the Qi entered his body, Qin Yu immediately felt a strong spiritual qi merging with his essence soul.

“Hiss...”

After feeling this power, Qin Yu could not help but gasp.

This was much stronger than the effects of herbs!

Even the heaven grade medicinal pills refined by Qin Yu couldn’t be compared to this!

No Wonder Tian Xuehong risked his life to use this technique!

“It’s said that back then, the slaughter celestial sect relied on this technique to become the number one sect in the world, creating countless almighty figures. Its sect master even directly stepped into the tribulation stage,”Qin Yu said in a low voice.

Not to mention a vicious person like the Sky Blood Rainbow, even Qin Yu was somewhat tempted.

Such a cultivation speed was indeed too fast! It was absolutely beyond reason!

Qin Yu rubbed his chin and muttered, “If it was using the heaven swallowing technique, this divine sense wouldn’t be able to display such power.”

He had once used the heaven swallowing technique to absorb the divine sense of others, and the effect it brought was far inferior. It couldn’t be compared to the slaughter celestial sect’s secret technique.

Qin Yu frowned slightly.

“We must find the heavenly blood rainbow as soon as possible,”Qin Yu said in a low voice.

The Heavenly Blood Rainbow was a genius of the immortal slaughtering sect, and he had mastered this secret technique.

Once he grew up, it would be a disaster for the world.

It was not impossible to revitalize the immortal slaughtering sect.

Moreover... Qin Yu was also somewhat interested in this secret technique.

Even if it was not as heartless as the sky blood rainbow, at least it could be used to kill enemies.

Qin Yu did not think any further. He closed his eyes slightly and continued to absorb the internal Qi in the jar.

The internal Qi was extremely dense. After all, it was formed from the divine sense of more than ten thousand martial marquis.

Even though Qin Yu had the internal Qi method, it was still impossible to completely absorb it in a short period of time.

In the blink of an eye, three days had passed.

Qin Yu opened his eyes slightly. He tried to sense the internal Qi in the jar and discovered that there was still half a jar inside.

“According to this progress, if I were to completely absorb this internal QI, it would not be impossible for me to enter the intermediate stage of the Martial Saint Stage,”Qin Yu said in a low voice.

“How terrifying.”

One had to know that Qin Yu needed a large amount of resources to advance to the next stage!

Yet, this divine sense was able to advance his cultivation in such a short period of time. This was enough to show how terrifying it was!

“Qin Yu, everyone is here.”

At this moment, Zhai Xing’s voice came from outside.

“Got it,”Qin Yu replied. Then, he stood up and walked out of the secret room.

“Qin Yu, the situation is a little different from what we expected,”Zhai Xing said as he walked.

“Oh?”Qin Yu raised his eyebrows and signaled Zhai Xing to continue.

Zhai Xing said, “This news still got out. Many people have gathered here and want to go to Cloud Dragon Island with us.”

Qin Yu smiled and said, “It’s okay. Those who come will have a share.”

Zhai Xing opened his mouth as if he wanted to say something, but in the end, he shook his head.

“Right, has pavilion master and Jiang and the others come?”At this time, Qin Yu suddenly thought of something.

“Yes, they have come,”Zhai Xing said. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Qin Yu nodded slightly.

Such a good thing could not be left out.

The two walked out of the secret realm and came all the way to the martial arts association in Jingdu.

They saw that many people were already standing in the martial arts discussion hall.

Besides Chang Mang and the others, there were also more than ten strangers.

Some of these people had white hair and some had a hunched figure. The clothes on his body were also somewhat strange, as if he had lost touch with the times.

“Pavilion Master.”Qin Yu walked to the front of the pavilion master and bowed to her.

The pavilion master agreed and then said, “Qin Yu, do you know all these people?”

“No.”Qin Yu shook his head.

He released his divine sense and swept it over them.

“They are all martial saints?”Qin Yu could not help but be a little surprised.

When did so many martial saints appear in the world? Some of them were even at the late stage of the martial saint realm and were on par with Zhai Xing!

“That’s strange. Before this, why have I never heard of them?”Qin Yu said in a low voice.

Zhai Xing said solemnly, “These people have been in seclusion for many years. This time, they’ve probably heard of the news of the Holy Region.”

Qin Yu rubbed his chin.

He didn’t really care about this, but what made Qin Yu curious was why they hadn’t come to the Jingdu martial arts association earlier to plunder these resources?

“Zhai Xing, long time no see!”

At this moment, an old man with white hair walked over with his hands behind his back.

The internal Qi on his body was extremely dense, and each of his movements contained an extremely intense aura fluctuation.

“Old eccentric Yuan, I didn’t expect you to come as well,”Zhai Xing said coldly.

The old man called old eccentric Yuan laughed loudly and said, “With such a good thing, how can my figure be absent? As for you, I heard that Gu Zizhen is really dead, and you followed behind a little brat, acting as his lackey?”

Zhai Xing frowned slightly and did not make a sound.

The people around seemed to be in cahoots with this old man. They looked at Zhai Xing with a mocking gaze.

“Zhai Xing, back then, you were someone who could dominate the world with a long sword. How did you end up like this?”The old man continued.

“Gu Zizhen is dead. You, the number two in a thousand years, did not ascend to the top. Instead, you let a little ghost seize the position?”

Qin Yu frowned slightly.

His internal Qi swept across this elder and discovered that he was also an advanced stage martial saint. His strength was on par with Zhai Xing’s.

However, what he said made people extremely displeased.

Qin Yu glanced at him and said, “If you want to go to the Cloud Dragon Island, then shut up and shut up.”

The elder laughed loudly and said, “You are that Little Brat, right? You look ordinary, but how did you take Gu Zizhen’s position?”
