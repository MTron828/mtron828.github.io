Li Zinan was stunned when he saw Cheng put dozens of pills into his mouth!

How could he eat pills like this?

Qin Yu swallowed nearly a hundred pills before burping contentedly.

“I’m done.” Qin Yu patted his stomach.

Then, he looked at Li Zinan and grinned. “Although I haven’t returned to my peak, I think it shouldn’t be a problem for me to deal with you.”

Li Zinan hurriedly took two steps back.

A grave expression flashed across his face, and his eyes narrowed slightly.

Qin Yu’s ruthlessness just now had left an indelible impression on him.

Even though he had already set up a killing array, he still had some apprehension.

At this moment, Yao Qing, who was hiding in the dark, slowly walked out.

Seeing Yao Qing, Li Zinan seemed to have grabbed onto a life-saving straw.

He hurriedly looked at Yao Qing and said, “Yao Qing, since you’re Jiang He’s disciple, hurry up and kill him!”

Yao Qing grinned and said, “Kill him? Yeah right!”

Li Zinan was stunned and said with some confusion, “What do you mean?”

Yao Qing ignored Li Zinan. He took off the hat on his head and walked quickly to Qin Yu.

“Mr. Qin,” Yao Qing said with a smile.

Qin Yu said with some surprise, “It’s you? Why are you here?”

Yao Qing waved his hand and said, “Now is not the time to talk about this. This kid has set up a killing formation here. Mr. Qin, you have to be careful.”

“Killing formation?” Qin Yu raised his eyebrows.

He released his divine sense and tried to sense the killing intent from the surroundings.

Sure enough, a killing formation had been set up by the riverside.

“Huh? Jing Lu hasn’t left yet?” At this moment, Qin Yu’s divine sense caught a figure.

This figure was Jing Lu, who had been spared by Qin Yu.

“Well, if he hasn’t left, then I don’t need to spare his life,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

Then, he turned to look at Li Zinan and said indifferently, “Make your move. Let me see your killing formation.”

At this moment, Li Zinan was already panicking. He hurriedly said, “Mr. Qin, I apologize for my presumptuous act just now! Let me go!”

“Let you go?” Qin Yu shook his head.

“I will never spare those who want to kill me.”

Li Zinan gritted his teeth and knelt on the ground with a plop. He begged bitterly, “Mr. Qin, if you are willing to let me go, I can give you a sum of property!”

“No need.” Qin Yu shook his head.

Qin Yu would never let him go.

“If you don’t make a move, I won’t be polite anymore,” Qin Yu said coldly.

Li Zinan knew that Qin Yu would not show mercy, so he could only stand up and gnash his teeth. “Your killing intent is too heavy. Sooner or later, you will be punished by the heavens! The heavens will not forgive you!”

Qin Yu sneered. “What’s the point of saying such nonsense? It’s better to make a move quickly.”

“Good! Then I’ll let you see my power!” Li Zinan roared repeatedly!

Li Zinan used his mental power, and Qin Yu’s body immediately emitted bursts of explosive sounds!

“Oh really?” Qin Yu raised his eyebrows.

He only felt that his body seemed to have been slashed by countless blades, but it couldn’t break through the defense of his body.

“Just this?” Qin Yu couldn’t help but frown.

If Li Zinan was so weak, if he wanted to put on an act... It would be really difficult.

Li Zinan’s expression was also somewhat ugly.

He had used this technique to wipe out an Inner Strength Grandmaster, but it was useless in front of Qin Yu!

Qin Yu’s body shook, and the traces of killing intent disappeared without a trace.

“Show me some of your true abilities,” Qin Yu said indifferently with his hands behind his back.

Li Zinan’s expression gradually turned cold.

He knew clearly that he couldn’t hurt Qin Yu at all unless he showed his trump card.

“Qin Yu, is there no more room for negotiation?” Li Zinan still had a trace of hope in his heart.

Qin Yu said coldly, “You talk too much nonsense.”

After saying that, a golden palm hit Li Zinan’s body!

Although he didn’t use his full strength, this palm still sent Li Zinan flying.

“You’ve gone too far! I will never forgive you!” Li Zinan crawled up from the ground and raised his head to roar!

In an instant, strands of killing intent came from all directions!

This killing intent was boundless!

“This is more like it.” The corners of Qin Yu’s mouth curled up into a sneer.

He clenched his fist and used his physical body to smash at the strands of killing intent!

“Boom!”

Explosions sounded incessantly. Endless killing intent was continuously condensing. It was extremely annoying.

At this moment, Li Zinan quickly stood up. With a jolt of his feet, he came to the surface of the water!

He muttered something and his hands quickly formed seals in the air, as if he was activating some spell!

“Mr. Qin, interrupt him quickly!” Yao Qing anxiously shouted.

However, Qin Yu, calmly resisting the killing intent that came from the earth, acted as if he didn’t hear him.

“Splash!”

More than ten minutes later, the entire surface of the water shook violently!

Then, the river water seemed to have gained a life of its own. Under Li Zinan’s control, it transformed into various shapes.

“I have already fused the killing intent of the earth with the surface of the water. Qin Yu, prepare to die!” Li Zinan sneered repeatedly.

Qin Yu looked at Li Zinan and sneered. “It sounds pretty good. I just don’t know if it will work.”

“You can try it!” Li Zinan said coldly.

The river water seemed to have fused with Li Zinan and changed with Li Zinan’s telekinesis.

“Splash!”

The water surface suddenly surged. A water dragon with endless killing intent charged toward Qin Yu!

Qin Yu sneered. “Water dragon? It’s not worth mentioning!”

After saying that, Qin Yu clenched his golden fist and charged forward.

“Boom!”

With this punch, the head of the water dragon was smashed into a spray of water! Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

But in the next second, the water merged together again!

“You can handle one, but what about ten?” Li Zinan’s eyes were filled with madness.

Then, one water dragon after another appeared on the surface of the water!

Under Li Zinan’s command, these water dragons with hidden killing intent charged at Qin Yu once again!

“If this is all you have, I’m afraid you won’t have the chance to hurt me,” Qin Yu said coldly.

Qin Yu’s golden figure flashed in the air. Qin Yu’s moves were grand as he blew up one water dragon after another!

“I can’t wait any longer.” Qin Yu frowned.

He looked at Li Zinan and whispered, “Shrinking Ground Into An Inch!”

As soon as he finished his words, Qin Yu arrived in front of Li Zinan!

“Oh no!” Li Zinan’s expression changed. He hurriedly urged the river water to form a layer of armor on his body!

“Boom!”

However, Qin Yu’s strength was unparalleled. The armor was penetrated by a punch. Li Zinan’s body smashed into the surface of the water!

The surface of the water stirred up with waves, and Li Zinan’s blood dyed the river. He was seriously injured!

“Qin Yu, I’ll fight it out with you!” In a short while, Li Zinan rushed out from under the water!

His long hair was wet, and strands of killing intent condensed in his palm!

The seemingly endless killing intent finally condensed into the form of a dagger.

“Li Zinan, I’ve played with you enough,” Qin Yu said coldly.

Li Zinan roared crazily, “Then you can go to h*ll!”

After saying that, Li Zinan threw the dagger that was formed from the killing intent at Qin Yu!

Qin Yu clenched his golden fist. He didn’t dodge, like he was willing to risk his life!

This dagger was aimed at Qin Yu’s dantian!

Qin Yu’s fist had already arrived in front of Li Zinan!
