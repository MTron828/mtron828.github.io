Qi Yang stroked Lin Wan’s hair with a doting expression and said with a smile, “Alright, I promise you.”

Qin Yu’s patience began to fade.

Qin Yu loathed women like Lin Wan even more.

Qin Yu slowly turned around and was about to speak when Lincheng suddenly waved his hand and said, “Forget it. Forget it. Let him go.”

“Dad!” Lin Wan immediately stomped her feet in displeasure.

Lincheng berated, “Brat, why aren’t you leaving?!”

Qin Yu was still enraged.

Ever since he entered the fifth level of the Qi Refining Stage, Qin Yu felt that he was becoming colder and colder.

But in the end, he still held it in.

“Mr. Lin, I advise you to discipline your daughter properly. Otherwise, she will suffer sooner or later.” Qin Yu glanced at them coldly and then left.

After Qin Yu and the others left, Lin Wan angrily said, “Dad, what do you mean? It’s bad enough that you don’t help me deal with him, but you won’t even let Qi Yang beat him up?!”

Lincheng glanced at Lin Wan and lamented, “This kid has the backing of the Yan family. It’s fine if we humiliate him, but if we really hurt him, we won’t be able to bear the consequences.”

Qi Yang was a lot less cocky when he heard this.

Lin Wan was the only one who was still unwilling to give up. “I don’t care about the Yan family. I will definitely take revenge!”

...

Qin Yu and Lance left the Lin family.

On the way back, Lance was extremely nervous.

When the car arrived at Dragon Paradise, Lance suddenly knelt on the ground with a plop.

“Mr. Qin, I’ve let you down. I didn’t expect Lincheng to be such a person...” Lance, his face full of guilt, kneeled on the ground.

Qin Yu frowned slightly. He reached out his hand to Lance and said, “It’s not your fault. You’re the one who surprised me.”

Lance didn’t quite understand Qin Yu’s words.

Qin Yu lamented and said, “In such a degenerate environment like the Lin family, you’re still good-natured. That means you’re at least a person with morals.”

Lance was still well disposed, which was already very good.

“Thank you for your praise, Mr. Qin,” Lance said with some guilt.

“Oh, right.” At this time, Qin Yu suddenly looked at Lance.

He smiled and said, “Do you want to generate inner strength?”

Lance was stunned. He hurriedly nodded and said, “Of course!”

Qin Yu smiled and said, “Okay, come to my house in three days. I will teach you.”

“Really... really?!” Lance widened his eyes, as if he could not believe it.

Qin Yu smiled and said, “A promise is a promise.”

“Thank you, Mr. Qin!” Lance was extremely excited and knelt on the ground again.

After Lance left, Qin Yu turned around and returned home.

Yao Qing made a pot of tea for Qin Yu. After seeing Qin Yu’s expression, Yao Qing asked, “Mr. Qin, what’s wrong?”

Qin Yu lamented, then waved his hand and said, “The Lin family has really taught me a lesson.”

“Huh?” Yao Qing was baffled.

Qin Yu drank a mouthful of tea and said to himself, “Sometimes, under a genteel facade, there is a dirty heart.”

The next day, Qin Yu got up early and ran laps around Dragon Paradise with Yao Qing.

The two of them ran thirty laps for more than two hours.

When they walked back, the two of them were already drenched in sweat.

However, the difference was that Yao Qing was panting while Qin Yu’s breathing was still steady.

“Mr. Qin, when are you going to teach me the breathing exercise?” Yao Qing couldn’t help but ask.

Qin Yu smiled and said, “Don’t worry. Since I promised you, I will definitely teach you.”

As they spoke, the two of them returned to their home.

Just as they reached the door, Qin Yu was surprised to find a car parked at the door.

And beside the car stood a man in his fifties.

Qin Yu frowned slightly. He walked forward and before he could say anything, the man cupped his hands and said, “Greetings, Mr. Qin.”

This confused Qin Yu even more.

“You are?” Qin Yu looked at the man and asked politely.

The man continued, “Mr. Qin, you may not have heard of me. I am Zheng Mingshuo, the head of the Zheng Family Martial Arts School.”

“Zheng Family Martial Arts School?” Qin Yu was stunned.

“The Zheng family that is going to compete with the Lin Family Martial Arts School?” Qin Yu said in astonishment.

Zheng Mingshuo immediately said with some surprise, “I didn’t expect you to have heard of our martial arts school.”

Qin Yu smiled and couldn’t help but exclaim, “Fate is really a fickle thing.”

“Huh?” Zheng Mingshuo was confused.

Qin Yu waved his hand and said, “Since you are here, come in and have a seat.”

Zheng Mingshuo didn’t stand on ceremony and immediately followed Qin Yu into the courtyard of the villa.

“Yao Qing, go make a pot of tea,” Qin Yu said.

Yao Qing nodded. A few minutes later, Yao Qing came up with a pot of tea.

Zheng Mingshuo couldn’t help but lament, “I didn’t expect you to be so courteous despite your talent.”

Qin Yu smiled and said, “Mr. Zheng, you must be joking. I’m just an ordinary person.”

“If you were an ordinary person, I’m afraid we wouldn’t be worthy of living,” Zheng Mingshuo said self-mockingly.

Qin Yu sized up Zheng Mingshuo and couldn’t help but think to himself, it seemed that Zheng Mingshuo had a certain understanding of him. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“Why are you looking for me?” Qin Yu asked.

Zheng Mingshuo hurriedly waved his hand, and the person beside him immediately brought over a gift box.

After the gift box was opened, he saw that there was a ginseng inside.

Although this ginseng couldn’t compare to Lincheng’s, it was also ten years old.

“This is a wild mountain ginseng that I have treasured. I hope that you will accept it,” said Zheng Mingshuo.

Qin Yu frowned and shook his head. “I don’t accept gifts for free. Why are you looking for me, Mr. Zheng? Just tell me.”

Zheng Mingshuo was silent for a moment before saying, “I really have something I need your help with.”

Then, Zheng Mingshuo lamented and said, “As you know, our family and the Lin family are going to hold a competition. Both sides will send their best disciples to participate in the competition.”

“That being said, in reality, everyone will find external help. The Lin family’s connections are stronger than ours, so the external help they find is also far superior to our family’s.”

At this point, Zheng Mingshuo paused and then said with a pleading tone, “So, I would like to ask you to represent our family’s martial arts school in the competition!”

Hearing this, Qin Yu almost spat out a mouthful of tea!

He had just gone to the Lin family last night, and today, the Zheng family came?

“What a coincidence.” Qin Yu couldn’t help but smile and shake his head.

Qin Yu looked at Zheng Mingshuo and said with puzzlement, “Didn’t the Zheng family invite an expert? Why would you guys come to find me?”

Zheng Mingshuo forced a smile and said, “That’s just to scare Lincheng. With our family’s ability, what kind of expert can we invite?”

Qin Yu suddenly understood.

He didn’t expect that these martial arts centers also had infighting.

Seeing that Qin Yu didn’t speak for a long time, Zheng Mingshuo couldn’t help but lament and said, “I knew you wouldn’t agree. I’m sorry to disturb you.”

After saying that, Zheng Mingshuo turned around and was about to leave.

Qin Yu looked at Zheng Mingshuo’s back and said with a smile, “Mr. Zheng, you didn’t take your ginseng.”

Zheng Mingshuo stopped in his tracks and shook his head. “There’s no reason to take back what I’ve given away. Mr. Qin, I’ll take my leave.”

After saying that, Zheng Mingshuo left in large strides without turning his head back.

Zheng Mingshuo’s attitude had indeed moved Qin Yu.

Moreover, Qin Yu also wanted to let Lincheng know that Qi Yang wasn’t worth mentioning when compared to him!

“Wait.” So, Qin Yu called out to Zheng Mingshuo.
