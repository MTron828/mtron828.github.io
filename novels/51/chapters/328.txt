Qian Yiming’s expression changed slightly. He sized up Jiang Gu and said with a frown, “You are Jiang Gu? Nonsense.”

Although Qian Yiming didn’t know Jiang Gu, a famous person in the provincial capital, he had seen Jiang Gu in media.

The Jiang Gu in his impression didn’t look like this at all!

“Sure enough, they found a group of actors.” Qian Yiming confirmed his thoughts.

He stood up and pointed at Qin Yu. “You’re pretty impressive. To show off, you found a group of actors?”

Jiang Gu frowned. “What do you mean?”

Qian Yiming snorted. “Nothing much. If I’m not mistaken, you are all probably working as security guards.”

The expressions of the people who came to visit from the provincial capital turned cold.

“Qian Yiming, you’d better consider the consequences when you speak,” Qin Yu reminded him kindly.

Qian Yiming was unmoved and continued to mock, “Consequences? They’re just a bunch of lame security guards. What consequences can there be?”

“You’ve gone too far!” Finally, Qi Sheng’s secretary couldn’t hold it in anymore!

“Which company are you from? Why are you so arrogant?”

“No one dares to talk to me like that!”

Facing the anger of the crowd, Qian Yiming didn’t care at all.

He sneered and said, “Keep pretending. A bunch of lame security guards think that they can go from rags to riches by wearing nice clothes?”

“I’ll tell you, I’m the boss of Yiming Real Estate, Qian Yiming!”

“Yiming Real Estate? Okay, I’ll remember it,” Qi Sheng’s secretary said coldly.

He glanced at Qin Yu and said, “Mr. Qin, he’s not your friend?”

“I don’t know him,” Qin Yu said casually.

“That’s good.” The secretary nodded.

He took out his cell phone and made a call.

After the call was connected, he immediately shouted, “Stop all of Yiming Real Estate’s projects. Do it now!” Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

It wasn’t just the secretary from Qi Sheng. The others had also issued a ban on Yiming Real Estate at the same time.

These people were all the leading businessmen in the provincial capital. It was effortless for them to deal with the trifling Yiming Real Estate.

At this moment, Qian Yiming still didn’t realize the seriousness of the matter.

He waved his hand and said, “Continue eating and drinking!”

At this moment, Qian Yiming’s phone suddenly rang.

He picked up the phone and saw that the caller was his secretary.

Qian Yiming held the phone and thought to himself, “Sending me New Year’s greetings so late? Looks like I’ll have to deduct your salary.”

After saying that, Qian Yiming picked up the phone.

“Why did you send me New Year’s greetings so late? Don’t you want your job?” Qian Yiming said unhappily.

The secretary on the other end said anxiously, “Mr. Qian, something bad has happened!”

“What happened?” Qian Yiming frowned.

The secretary hurriedly said, “People suddenly called and stopped all the projects of our company!”

“And a few real estate moguls in the provincial capital joined hands to blacklist our company!”

Qian Yiming’s expression immediately changed drastically!

He suddenly stood up and exclaimed, “What did you say?! How... How is this possible?”

The secretary forced a smile and said, “Mr. Qian, you better think of a way. After the New Year, we still have a few loans that are due. If the project is stopped... We won’t be able to repay it.”

After saying that, the secretary hung up the phone.

Qian Yiming’s face instantly turned pale!

Could it be that these people were really important figures from the provincial capital?

“You... who exactly are you?” Qian Yiming pointed at Qin Yu and asked in a trembling voice.

Someone beside him sneered and said, “You don’t even know the King of Chuzhou, yet you’re mingling in the provincial capital?”

King of Chuzhou!

Hearing this name, Qian Yiming immediately turned pale with fright!

The name ‘King of Chuzhou’ had spread throughout the entire provincial capital!

There were countless legends about him!

“You... you are the King of Chuzhou?” Qian Yiming panicked.

He walked in front of Qin Yu anxiously and said with fear, “Mr. ... Mr. Qin, I was blind and didn’t know it was you. Please forgive me and give me a way out...”

Qin Yu couldn’t be bothered with Qian Yiming. He stood up and said, “Everyone, let’s find a new place.”

“No, no, no. Mr. Qin, we are only here to visit you. Since the gifts have been delivered, it’s time for us to go back,” everyone said.

Qin Yu didn’t stay any longer.

After sending everyone away, Qin Yu stretched his body and said, “We’ve finished the New Year’s Eve dinner. We should go back to sleep.”

Yao Qing said, “Mr. Qin, I heard that there will be a show later in the night.”

“I’m not interested.” Qin Yu waved his hand and turned around to leave.

Qian Yiming hurriedly grabbed Qin Yu’s arm and said in anguish, “Mr. Qin, I have parents and children to support. If I go bankrupt, what will happen to my family...”

Qin Yu glanced at him and sneered. “Does it have anything to do with a lame security guard like me?”

After saying this, Qin Yu turned around and left the hotel.

...

After he returned home, it suddenly snowed heavily.

Qin Yu stood in front of the window in pajamas while quietly looking out.

“Snow heralds a good year,” Qin Yu whispered.

A scene flashed in his mind.

He was holding Yan Ruoxue’s hand while making snowmen and having snowball fights in the ice and snow. There was no money, no secular world, but only the purest feelings in the bottom of his heart.

Unfortunately, this could only be an illusion.

The next day was the day to visit one’s relatives.

Qin Yu didn’t have any kin, so he didn’t go out for a few days.

He guarded the stove all day and quietly absorbed the weak spiritual energy from the surroundings.

The spiritual energy in Jiangcheng was very thin. Qin Yu had gone to almost all the places he could go.

The accumulation of spiritual energy was extremely slow. It would probably be difficult to recover even after eight to ten years.

Therefore, these few days of cultivation didn’t bring any obvious results.

In the blink of an eye, it was already the sixth day of the month.

Qin Yu estimated the time. There were only seven months left before the fight with Han Wei.

“I must at least reach the peak of the Monastic Stage, or even higher, the Enlightenment Stage, in seven months. Otherwise, there is absolutely no chance of victory,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

The Enlightenment Stage corresponded to the Inner Strength Grandmaster stage.

As long as he stepped into the Inner Strength Grandmaster stage, Qin Yu had full confidence that he would be invincible among those of the same stage.

Qin Yu wouldn’t even be afraid of Yan Jiang, who was at the peak of the Inner Strength Grandmaster stage.

As for the Golden Core Stage beyond that, it was too far away for Qin Yu. He didn’t dare to dream about it for the time being.

On the seventh day of the Lunar New Year, Qin Yu was ready to leave Jiangcheng and head straight for the Divine Medicine Pavilion.

The Divine Alchemist Pavilion, also known as the Divine Alchemist Valley, not only gathered the top alchemists in the country, but they also possessed extremely powerful medicinal herbs.

Even the top aristocratic families in the world would request them from the Divine Alchemist Pavilion.
