Qin Yu walked slowly to the stone door.

Just as Lu Guan had said, the loss of spiritual power was much faster as he got closer.

At this rate, the spiritual power in his body would be completely lost within an hour.

Qin Yu clenched his fist and said in a low voice, “Try to leave this place before the spiritual power runs out.”

Then, Qin Yu turned to look at Lu Guan behind him and shouted, “How do we open the Gate?”

“There’s no other way except to break the gate open violently,”Lu Yun said.

They didn’t seem to have any intention of leaving. Instead, they wanted to see if Qin Yu could withstand the stale air.

Qin Yu raised his head to look at the huge gate in front of him. Then, he clenched his Golden Fist and threw it at the stone gate!

“Boom!”

A wave of dust flew up and a huge hole was punched through the door by Qin Yu!

This door was not as strong as Qin Yu had imagined. Instead, it was a little fragile.

The door was shattered and Qin Yu strode into the sacred mausoleum.

The Twilight Qi instantly covered the sky and earth and spread over!

The spiritual power in Qin Yu’s body was losing at an extremely fast speed!

“Qin Yu, if you really can’t do it, come out. Your life is important,”Chang Mang shouted from behind.

“Okay, if I can’t hold on, I’ll leave as soon as possible,”Qin Yu shouted without turning his head.

The world behind the gate was not as splendid as he had imagined. It was surrounded by earth, wood, and walls. It was extremely ordinary.

On both sides, there were two huge statues. The statues flickered with bright light, looking somewhat strange.

Further in, one could see pieces of gold products. They were like ornaments, placed in all directions.

If these gold products were to be brought to the mortal world, it would definitely cause a huge commotion. However, to Qin Yu, these items were worthless.

He opened the desolate God’s eye and looked straight ahead.

Under the coverage of the desolate God’s eye, the entire sacred mausoleum could be seen clearly.

Several hundred meters in front of him, there was a coffin.

On both sides of the coffin, human burial pits appeared once again.

Other than the human burial pits, there were also many bronze artifacts placed on both sides. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

These bronze artifacts looked ordinary, but because they were stained with the sacred might, they were no weaker than ordinary magical artifacts.

He released his divine sense and covered the sacred mausoleum.

What surprised Qin Yu was that there were no spirit guardians in such a large-scale sacred mausoleum.

In other words, other than the twilight qi, there was no obstruction in the sacred mausoleum.

“A few hundred meters...”Qin Yu murmured softly.

The spiritual power in Qin Yu’s body could not be balanced at such a long distance.

“No, I have to speed up,”Qin Yu thought to himself.

Since there was no spirit guardian and no hidden killing formation, Qin Yu did not need to worry.

He immediately stepped on the ‘xing’character and shot toward the coffin!

The flesh and bones of saints were top-notch holy objects, not weaker than any magic artifacts.

As long as he was close to the coffin, his trip would not be in vain.

After shooting more than a hundred meters in one breath, the speed of the loss of spiritual power in Qin Yu’s body also began to increase.

As the spiritual power disappeared, Qin Yu also began to be unable to support the ‘xing’character.

Not only that, as he got closer and closer to the bronze coffin, the Holy Aura also began to exert its power.

This caused Qin Yu’s footsteps to slow down a lot in an instant.

He fell from midair, and could only forcefully support his body as he walked towards the bronze coffin.

The spiritual power in his body was losing more and more quickly, like a reservoir draining water, flowing out continuously.

“It’s bad.”Qin Yu thought to himself that things were not good, and a wave of fatigue assaulted his body!

At this moment, he was still two hundred meters away from the bronze coffin. However, Qin Yu realized that he was having some difficulty walking.

“This won’t do. At this speed, I’m afraid I can only hold on for a few minutes at most.”Qin Yu frowned.

He tried to seal all the acupoints in his body in an attempt to stop the loss of spiritual energy. Unfortunately, it was futile and useless.

Qin Yu gritted his teeth, forcefully withstanding the holy power, and rushed toward the bronze coffin at his fastest speed.

But after a few steps, the spiritual power in Qin Yu’s body was completely depleted!

Under the spread of the Holy Power, Qin Yu found it difficult to even lift his feet!

With each step he took, the pressure on his body became heavier.

What was more terrifying was that it was already too late for Qin Yu to turn around and leave.

Because he didn’t have the spiritual power to make it, coupled with this terrifying holy might, Qin Yu’s speed became extremely slow!

Even if he tried his best to walk out, he would probably lose his lifespan!

“Oh no!”Qin Yu’s expression changed drastically!

This time, he probably didn’t have as much luck as he had imagined. He even fell into a dilemma.

His spiritual power had already been completely exhausted. Under the influence of the Twilight Qi, Qin Yu’s lifespan started to lose.

Under such a dangerous situation, Qin Yu didn’t even have time to think. Every second he delayed, his lifespan would decrease by a few points!

“Advancing or retreating is death. I might as well give it my all!”Qin Yu gritted his teeth and walked towards the bronze coffin with great difficulty!

This was the principle that Qin Yu had always followed. If he retreated, he would die. If he advanced, he would at least have a chance of survival!

When he was still a hundred meters away from the bronze coffin, Qin Yu’s lifespan had already been greatly affected.

He lay on the ground and crawled forward. Age spots began to appear on his face. His jet-black and beautiful long hair actually grew white!

His originally ink-like long hair rapidly turned white at a speed visible to the naked eye. In the blink of an eye, his black hair turned white!
