Chapter 915: Chapter 915, cultivation in an otherworldly paradise 

The invisible pressure brought by these seven people made everyone tremble with fear.

Even the arrogant young masters of the aristocratic families were silenced at this moment.

“Seven martial saints... They can be said to be the rulers of this world.”Zhuang Teng could not help but mutter in a low voice.

“With them around, it’s impossible for us to obtain any benefits.” ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“So What? Even a martial saint can’t be too overbearing! If he has the ability, he can just kill us all!”

“Those young masters in the secret realm haven’t arrived yet. When they do, who knows what will happen.”

Everyone stared at the huge mine that was about to be excavated in front of them. Their faces were filled with worry.

...

On the other side.

When Qin Yu woke up, he was already lying on a bamboo bed.

The surrounding environment made Qin Yu feel extremely unfamiliar.

Although this room was extremely simple and crude, it was rather clean.

Qin Yu slowly sat up from the bed.

He rubbed his head and felt dizzy. His chest was faintly aching.

It was obvious that the injuries on Qin Yu’s body had not healed.

Then, Qin Yu released his spiritual sense and covered the surroundings.

Soon, Qin Yu discovered a few figures.

Judging from their internal QI, they seemed to be ordinary people.

“You’re awake.”

At this moment, a girl dressed in ordinary clothes walked in from outside.

The girl had thick black hair, and the clothes on her body indicated her family’s situation.

“You are?”Qin Yu tried to ask.

The girl quickly said, “My name is Yu Qin. I saw you when I was picking herbs, so I conveniently brought you back.”

Qin Yu glanced at the herbs on the table, then looked at the decoction that was being brewed.

“You brewed this?”Qin Yu asked.

Yu Qin quickly nodded and said, “Yes, my father taught me this.”

Qin Yu slowly walked to the table. He picked up the decoction and sniffed it. He couldn’t help but be a little surprised.

Although the medicine that this girl brewed was relatively ordinary, her technique was extremely meticulous.

“Don’t worry. My father is an old doctor in the vicinity. He saved a lot of people!”Yu Qin seemed to be afraid that Qin Yu would be worried, so she hurriedly explained.

Qin Yu smiled and said, “Thank you.”

Only then did Yu Qin let out a sigh of relief. She whispered, “I saw that you were seriously injured. I thought that you couldn’t be saved. I didn’t expect you to recover so quickly...”

Qin Yu didn’t say much. This Yu Qin was just an ordinary person. There was no need to tell her too much.

“You just woke up. You should be very hungry, right? Wait a moment. My House will be serving dinner soon.”Yu Qin seemed to have thought of something.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “Then I’ll have to trouble you.”

Yu Qin said a little flustered, “It’s okay, it’s okay. You rest first. I’ll come and call you later.”

With that, she ran out in a hurry.

Qin Yu got up and walked out of the room.

The fresh air was blowing in their faces. This was actually a small mountain village.

And the entire mountain village was surrounded by mountains and forests. It was practically isolated from the world.

“I didn’t expect there to be such a place.”Qin Yu sighed.

There was a faint qi/spiritual energy here. Although it couldn’t allow martial artists to make much progress, it was of great benefit to the villagers.

Then, Qin Yu looked to the side of the room and found many dried herbs hanging on the wall.

These herbs were very common, and many of them were wild herbs that couldn’t be named.

“This is a good place to heal,”Qin Yu sighed.

Since Qin Yu had nowhere to go, he might as well stay here to heal his wounds.

“With my current body condition, I can recover in three days at most,”Qin Yu thought to himself.

Three days was not a big deal. Moreover, this kind of peaceful life might bring a different state of mind and help with cultivation.

Just as Qin Yu’s thoughts were running wild, Yu Qin ran over from not far away.

“Well... the meal is ready. Let’s Go Eat,”Yu Qin said softly.

Qin Yu glanced at her and saw that her face was red and full of shyness.

“You seem very shy,”Qin Yu said casually.

A hint of panic flashed across Yu Qin’s face. She hurriedly said, “I. . . Let’s hurry to eat. They are all waiting...”

Looking at Yu Qin’s appearance, Qin Yu could not help but think of the first time he saw Yan Ruoxue.

The current Yu Qin was very much like Qin Yu back then.

“Okay.”Qin Yu smiled and nodded.

He and Yu Qin walked towards a courtyard in the village.

On the way, Yu Qin asked in a low voice, “What’s Your Name?”

“Qin Yu.”

“Qin Yu... a very nice name,”Yu Qin said.

Qin Yu didn’t say much. His heart was a little chaotic.

Although he wanted to recuperate peacefully for a few days, his heart couldn’t calm down at all.

Countless troubles surged into his heart, causing Qin Yu to frown from time to time.

Yu Qin did not dare to say anything when she saw this. She could only follow carefully from the side.

Soon, the two of them arrived at a large courtyard.

There was a large round table in the courtyard. The round table was filled with food.

The food was also extremely sumptuous. Other than wild vegetables, there was also the meat of wild beasts nearby.

Beside the table, there were three generations of people, Old and young.

“Xiao Qin, come and sit down.”An old man waved at Yu Qin.

Yu Qin quickly pulled Qin Yu over.

“Young man, you’re Awake? How Are You Feeling?”

“You’re from the city, aren’t you? With such serious injuries, you must have met wild beasts, right?”

“Where are your companions? Are You Alone?”

“There are a lot of wild beasts around here. You have to be more careful and don’t go out by yourself.”

“...”

The villagers here seemed to be extremely enthusiastic. Qin Yu kept picking up food.

It was rare for Qin Yu to have such a leisurely mood, so he simply blended in.

After a conversation, they learned that this village was called Shan Nan Village. The village had existed for many years, and very few people in this village were willing to go out.

They usually relied on farming, growing vegetables, and hunting for a living. It was truly like a paradise.

After eating, the people in the village lit a fire and sang around the fire.

The scene of singing and dancing could not help but make Qin Yu feel a little unreal.

Compared to the dangers outside, this place was really a pure land.

After dinner, Yu Qin brought Qin Yu home.

On the way back, Qin Yu asked casually, “Why aren’t you seeing your parents?”

When this topic was brought up, Yu Qin couldn’t help but whisper, “My parents have passed away, and I only have one younger brother.”

“Oh,”Qin Yu answered casually.

Qin Yu didn’t feel much about Yu Qin’s tragic life. Qin Yu was already used to life and death.

After returning to her residence, Yu Qin busied herself with arranging the herbs.

“You... wait for a moment. I will boil some water for you to wash up later,”Yu Qin said as she tidied up.

Qin Yu waved his hand and casually found a place to sit down.

Qin Yu’s mind was filled with worries as he gazed at the full moon in the sky.

‘It’s too difficult to fight against them without stepping into the martial saint stage,’Qin Yu thought to himself.

He could not help but recall the scene of his fight with Uncle Zhen.

Apparently, Uncle Zhen had not displayed his full strength. Otherwise, Qin Yu would have died at his hands.

“Martial saint...”Qin Yu could not help but feel a little worried.

Even with the line word formula, a martial saint could seal the space.

If he met them again, he would not be able to escape so easily.

“It would be great if I could change my appearance,”Qin Yu thought to himself.

Yu Qin had already prepared the herbs.

She knocked the herbs into a basket and carried them on her back.

“Qin... Yu, I’m going to deliver the herbs. Do you... Do you want to come with me?”Yu Qin hesitated for a long time and mustered up her courage to ask.
