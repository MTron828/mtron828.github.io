Chapter 447: Death Warrant! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Li Zinan became more and more agitated as he spoke. He stared fixedly at Qin Yu and said crazily, “Qin Yu, if you dare to lay a finger on me today, the Saint Confucian Sect will never let you off!”

Qin Yu sneered and said, “Half-step Martial Marquis, right? I really want to see for myself.”

After possessing the Venerable Fifth Mountain, Qin Yu no longer had a precise grasp of his own strength. He wanted to find a top-notch martial artist to test his skills.

People like He Teng and Meng Wuxiong couldn’t intimidate Qin Yu anymore.

“I remember that Han Wei is a half-step Martial Marquis, right?” Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and said.

Li Zinan’s expression changed. He subconsciously took two steps back and exclaimed, “You... What do you want to do?!”

“What do you think I want to do?” Qin Yu raised his eyebrows. In the next second, a golden light hit Li Zinan’s body!

Li Zinan’s entire body was instantly struck by a huge force, and his body was sent flying with a thump!

This strike was extremely powerful, and caused Li Zinan to vomit blood continuously!

And it was also at this moment that Li Zinan realized the difference in strength between him and Qin Yu!

He began to panic, but at this moment, Qin Yu had already taken a step forward. He ruthlessly stepped on Li Zinan’s chest!

“Pu!”

A mouthful of blood was spat out from Li Zinan’s mouth.

His chest sank a few times, and his internal organs suffered a huge impact.

He looked extremely bloody.

“Don’t kill me!” Li Zinan panicked.

He had finally become an Elder of the Saint Confucian Sect. How could he be willing to die just like that!?

“Qin Yu, listen to me!” Li Zinan said in fear.

“I am now an Elder of the Saint Confucian Sect! The Saint Confucian Sect is the largest sect in the entire northern region!”

“Don’t you have a grudge with the Yan family? As long as you get the Saint Confucian Sect, you will have the chance to rise!”

“I can use my identity as an Elder to work with you from the inside out!”

Qin Yu touched his chin and said indifferently, “I remember you saying that it’s not bad to be an ordinary person, right?”

Li Zinan was stunned. He asked in a trembling voice, “What... What do you mean?”

Qin Yu grinned and said, “That’s what I mean.”

As soon as he finished his words, Qin Yu kicked Li Zinan’s dantian.

“Bang!”

A crisp sound exploded in Li Zinan’s lower abdomen!

Then, Li Zinan felt a sharp pain in his abdomen, and his inner strength was rapidly dissipating!

“You... you actually crippled me!” Li Zinan widened his eyes!

Qin Yu imitated Li Zinan’s tone and said indifferently, “It’s not bad to be an ordinary person and struggle everyday. Isn’t that what you said?” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“You... You! Qin Yu, I’m going to kill you!” Li Zinan’s eyes were wide open as he roared crazily.

Qin Yu looked at Li Zinan coldly and said, “Get lost. Tell Yan Sihai that a person should have a conscience.”

After saying this, Qin Yu turned around and left.

Old Mister Yan asked with some confusion, “Why didn’t you kill him?”

Qin Yu smiled and said, “If I kill him, who will go back and tell Yan Sihai?”

At this moment, what Qin Yu wanted to do was to challenge the Yan family’s prestige.

Everyone returned to the hall together. Before they left, the group of rich men held Qin Yu’s hand and said, “Qin Yu, don’t forget about the mark in our bodies...”

Qin Yu nodded and said, “Don’t worry. As soon as I get the results, I will inform everyone immediately.”

After they left, Qin Yu said goodbye to Old Mister Yan and left.

He wasn’t in a hurry to leave Sea City. Instead, he brought Fang Yue and found a place to stay in Sea City.

Then, Qin Yu took out his phone and sent a text message to the Pavilion Master of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion to ask about Fang Yue’s condition.

Unfortunately, the Pavilion Master didn’t know about this either.

“Looks like I can only look for He Teng.” Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and thought.

...

Central Plains, He Family.

He Teng returned home in a gloomy mood.

“Teng’er, you’re back? Did the matter go smoothly?” He Rongshou, the head of the He family, asked with a sheepish smile.

He Teng didn’t say anything. He just glanced at He Rongshou coldly.

Feeling the murderous intent in his eyes, He Rongshou’s expression immediately changed. He subconsciously took two steps back.

He Teng snorted coldly and turned around to return to his room.

He Rongshou’s face was full of worry. The woman beside him couldn’t help but sigh.

“Ever since Teng’er had that accident, he seemed to have changed into a different person. Sigh...” the woman sighed.

He Rongshou said in a low voice, “If this goes on, there will be a day when he won’t acknowledge us as his parents...”

“It’s all our fault. We were too strict with him back then. But now, Teng’er barely acknowledges us anymore...” the woman couldn’t help but cover her face and sob softly.

He Rongshou was silent.

If they had known earlier, they would rather He Teng be an ordinary person.

He Teng’s expression was gloomy, and the hoarse voice in his body sounded crazy.

“The Dragon Spirit... The Dragon Spirit was stolen by Qin Yu!” He Teng said angrily.

“No matter what, we must kill Qin Yu! We must!” The hoarse voice also said.

He Teng’s expression was sulky, and he asked coldly, “Qin Yu has the power of the Divine Dragon. With my current strength, I can’t do anything to him unless I reach the half-step Martial Marquis Realm.”

“Go into seclusion.” That hoarse voice sounded once again.

“Go to the Dongchuan Water Rhyme Tower, and I will help you reach the half step Martial Marquis realm as soon as possible... . .”

When He Teng heard that, he nodded his head slightly.

... . .

There were only two months left until the ninth day of September.

And in the past few days, news of Han Wei had been spreading.

“It’s rumored that the Young Master of the Han clan, Han Wei, had fought against three half step Martial Marquises and won with ease!”

“According to an expert’s assessment, Han Wei has the potential to become number one among Pyro’s younger generation!”

“The Jingdu Martial Arts Association values Han Wei’s potential and has invited him to become a member of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association.”

“In a few days, Han Wei will face the veteran half-step Martial Marquis, Mr. Ning Wenbai!”

Upon seeing this news, the entire Martial Arts Forum was shocked!

“Face Ning Wenbai? I remember that Ning Wenbai has been famous for many years.”

“Rumor has it that when Ning Wenbai was strong, he had been a notch above Ye Qing and Jiang He!”

“Han Wei has actually reached such a level? Qin Yu is probably in danger.”

“Didn’t Qin Yu become a cripple? He’s not worth mentioning anymore, right?”

After seeing the news on the Martial Arts Forum, Qin Yu kept silent.

“Han Wei has been in the limelight recently.” Qin Yu touched his chin and said in a low voice.

Although Qin Yu now had the power of the Venerable Fifth Mountain and the Divine Dragon, no one could guarantee that the Han family wouldn’t have a more powerful magic artifact.

Moreover, Qin Yu himself didn’t know if he could fight against a half-step Martial Marquis.

At this moment, another piece of news came into his sight.

There was news from overseas that Hong Yi Sect had issued a death warrant against Qin Yu. They would dispatch ten half-step Martial Marquises to kill him!
