His Saint Kingdom let out a tremendous roaring sound, and suddenly, the sky was filled with thunderous downpours.

A majestic force surged, abruptly blasting toward the far reaches of the sky.

In an instant, the entire world changed drastically.

The Saints, who had calmed down from shock, became tremendously nervous again. Looking at the attack that condensed the power of the Saint Kingdom, they instantly looked nervous.

Even the most formidable Saints in front dared not relax, afraid that this power would fall on their divine kingdoms. “What is this lunatic trying to do?”

Revered Qi frowned and muttered to himself.

However, that energy did not land on any of the Saint Kingdoms.

Instead, it shot straight into the clouds until the holy power dissipated completely.

“He actually used the power of the Saint Kingdom to blast out a farewell firework. What a lunatic!”

Immortal Crane smiled wryly. No one had expected this.

This grand and mighty strike that had wasted the power of the Saint Kingdom was only for this brief moment of brilliance.

At this moment, Qin Yu suddenly opened his eyes in the Dao Mystical Saint Kingdom.

His eyes were full of confusion. After Zi Yang destroyed his body, the Seal of Heaven Returning that Chen Shuang had placed on his body protected his soul.

He had witnessed everything that happened after that.

However, even though he had witnessed the entire sequence of events, there were still many things that he did not understand, including how he had come here and what state Chen Shuang was in. He was ignorant of all these. “I wonder how Ruoxue and the others are doing and if Flower Granny and the others can come here!”

Qin Yu’s eyes turned bloodshot when he recalled how those Saints had joined forces to destroy the seeds of the human race at the last moment.

Such blood feuds must be avenged one by one!

The Seal of Heaven Returning lit up faintly in his soul.

The energy in the expanse of this heaven and earth slowly gathered toward Qin Yu. Not long after, it had already condensed a body for him.

“Hmm?”

During this process, Qin Yu seemed to faintly sense a slight fluctuation flash past as if someone was peeping.

Qin Yu frowned and gave up on the idea of further forging this body. He then directly left the spot.

He did not know anything about this place. The atmosphere here made him feel a tremendously strong sense of oppression. He dared not relax at all.

“What a terrifying power! Is this Saint power? Even a body that has just been condensed has such exaggerated physical strength! ”

If this power was in the human world, it could kill He Teng in an instant.

Qin Yu could even feel that this power was enough to fight the monster race’s general-in-chief, Xiang Yu, head-on.

And this was just a body that he had condensed in a hurry. One could imagine how terrifying the Saint power contained here was.

As Qin Yu lifted his leg, he felt a boundless and endless explosive force contained in his muscles. It was just a body that he had casually condensed.

Qin Yu traveled between heaven and earth at the fastest speed. Here, his divine sense could only scan a few hundred meters, which was the limit. It was a vast difference from the human world.

Moreover, after rushing for almost an hour, Qin Yu actually felt a sense of tiredness.

“It seems to be the power of the soul. It doesn’t seem compatible with the body condensed by the Saint power!”

Qin Yu was somewhat puzzled. In this half a day, he had also fumbled about some things.

In this Saint Kingdom, he totally could not use the rules he had comprehended previously. He did not know if his soul was still too weak or if this place had its own rules.

Like some mystic realms underneath, there would be strict chains of order.

Suddenly, Qin Yu heard the sky torn apart at his back.

“Again!”

Qin Yu frowned. A giant wolf with a ferocious look suddenly charged at his

DaCK.

Even though it was beyond a century away and Qin Yu could sense it, he still could not dodge due to the terrifying speed.

Qin Yu only had time to raise his knee and use the most formidable part of his body to clash with the giant wolf.

The violent power made him feel a little dizzy, but his body did not stop. Although he could not use techniques here, the instincts of his martial arts still existed.

Qin Yu took the opportunity when the demon wolf was sent flying to hide inside.

He sprinted with all his might, and his two fingers stabbed into the giant wolf’s right eye straightaway.

After that, he instantly hooked the skeleton of the giant wolf’s eye socket and pulled off half of its face with all his strength.

Then, Qin Yu punched with all his strength and directly blew up the giant wolf’s head.

“Hmm?”

Following the giant wolf’s injury, Qin Yu suddenly sensed some energy to have entered his soul.

It had allowed his soul power to increase slightly. Although this power was extremely minute, Qin Yu’s soul power still keenly sensed it.

“Could it be that the way to advance here is by killing different living beings to get their energy?”

Qin Yu secretly guessed the rules here.

After killing another wild beast that had ambushed him and an unknown bird, he was sure of this information.

These living beings seemed to have been born in this Saint Kingdom and had a trace of holy energy in their bodies.

Once they died, the holy energy would transfer to the person that killed them.

Qin Yu looked a little solemn. Based on such unique rules, this place would surely not be peaceful.

This kind of rule seemed to encourage mutual killing. Moreover, the last bird’s intelligence was clearly much higher than the first wolf. Even Qin Yu had to suffer many injuries before he could kill it.

However, after killing three demonic beasts, Qin Yu felt that his control over his entire body had relaxed slightly.

Sure enough, the holy energy here could enter the soul and fundamentally change the strength of the soul. This must be the secret of how the Saint became formidable.

“These should be low-intelligence demonic beasts. They should be at the lowest level of existence in this Saint Kingdom. If they have such strength, then what kind of strength do the living beings that have existed here for even longer have?”

Qin Yu’s eyes flashed with worry.

After these few demonic beasts died, he could no longer sense their soul fluctuations. In other words, if an accident happened here, there was no hope of resurrection.

After Qin Yu left for a long time, the ground suddenly loosened.

Suddenly, an alpaca carrying an old man appeared on the spot. The old man’s appearance was very strange. His head was a little abnormally large, and three strands of hair were on it.

“Three-Hair Old man, how strong is this guy? Have you figured it out after studying it for so long?”

The alpaca took a big bite of the soil and started munching on it.

“I’m not sure. Logically speaking, the souls of those who have just entered Saint Kingdom are very weak, and the bodies they condense are also very fragile. They can’t defeat these three natives..”
