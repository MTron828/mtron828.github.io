Chapter 1142: Chapter 1,142, the true guardian of the Dao? ! 

The high-ranking official’s entire body was exuding an overbearing internal QI, and his palm was also brewing a terrifying spell.

Qin Yu’s expression was extremely unsightly, and he couldn’t help but clench his fists.

With Yao Qing’s strength, he definitely wouldn’t be able to take a palm strike from a mighty figure!

“F * ck, I still failed in the end.”Qin Yu took a deep breath.

Now that things had come to this, Qin Yu had no other choice but to fight them to the death.

Just as Qin Yu was about to step out, Yao Qing suddenly said, “Okay, but you have to think carefully about the consequences of attacking me.”

“I’ve thought it through. I’ve thought it through long ago!”

That mighty figure roared angrily. He seemed to have determined that the guardian in front of him was fake!

His internal Qi condensed on his right palm and smacked toward Yao Qing!

This palm didn’t have any fancy techniques. It only had the purest spiritual power!

The palm formed by dense spiritual power was like a vast ocean, wantonly coming at him! Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Qin Yu’s face changed greatly. He hurriedly stepped forward, trying to block this palm for Yao Qing!

However, at this moment, Yao Qing took the lead and took a step forward. His palm lightly slapped towards the ray of light!

“Pa!”

A crisp sound rang out and a shocking scene happened.

The scene of Yao Qing being smashed into meat paste that he had imagined did not happen. The Ray of light that was shooting towards him was actually sent flying into the air by a slap. After that, it exploded in the air like fireworks!

Seeing this scene, Qin Yu could not help but gasp!

Yao Qing... had such strength?

Could it be that this almighty was just casually testing him? ! He did not use his true strength at all? !

In the sky, the expression of the almighty who attacked instantly became extremely ugly!

Because of fear, his expression was almost distorted, and his body trembled like a sieve!

To him, this was a gamble. The Gamble was that the Guardian in front of him was fake!

But if he made the wrong gamble, then he would face the price of death!

“Lord Guardian, Please Show Mercy!”Yan Yongfu was the first to react. He gave up his dignity and directly knelt down!

The mighty figure who made the move knelt on the ground and kept hitting the floor with his head, he apologized desperately, “Lord Dao Protector, I was blind. I was blind. I beg you to spare my life. Please spare my life... I was wrong. I know I was wrong...”

Looking at the attitude of these eight high-ranking officials, the surrounding crowd could not help but gasp!

What was the background of this Dao Protector? ! He actually made the famous eight high-ranking officials kneel and beg for mercy? !

Looking at the eight high-ranking officials in front of him, Yao Qing said coldly, “Your Life Is Mine.”

“Yes, yes. Thank you, Lord Dao Protector. Thank you, Lord Dao Protector!”The high-ranking official shouted with all his might. His excitement was evident in his words.

Yao Qing didn’t say anything. He turned around and left.

In the blink of an eye, he disappeared without a trace.

Qin Yu and the others were in a state of shock.

What was going on? Yao Qing actually had such powerful strength? !

Seeing the Dao Protector leave, Yan Yongfu and the others let out a long sigh of relief.

“The thing I was most worried about happened.”Yan Yongfu took a deep breath.

With the Dao Protector stepping out, how could they touch Qin Yu?

If they didn’t kill him, they would be the one to die.

“Qin Yu, don’t be complacent for too long.”Yan Yongfu looked at Qin Yu coldly.

“There are many ways to kill people. The Dao Protector can’t protect you forever. You have to die.”

Qin Yu ignored them. There was no meaning in his ruthless words.

“Let’s go.”Yan Yongfu snorted. He waved his hand and directly returned to the tunnel, back to the first mystic realm.

The second secret area gradually calmed down, leaving only the sound of discussion.

“The holy region hasn’t been opened yet. That’s only the first secret area. Please leave for now.”Jiang he stood up and said.

After dispersing the crowd, Qin Yu couldn’t help but let out a long sigh of relief.

“Damn, it was too close.”Qin Yu muttered.

“I really don’t know what method Yao Qing used to actually withstand that palm...”

Pavilion master didn’t say anything. Her willow-like eyebrows furrowed slightly, and she seemed to have a lot on her mind.

“Pavilion Master, What’s Wrong?”Qin Yu asked in puzzlement.

Pavilion master opened his mouth, and just as he was about to speak, he saw Yao Qing running over from outside.

That Black Robe was in his arms, and he barked his teeth as he walked in.

Seeing Yao Qing, Qin Yu hurriedly walked over and said, “Kid, you’re good! Tell me, what kind of spell can you learn?”

“What? What kind of spell?”Yao Qing said with a dumbfounded look.

“Are you still pretending to be me?”Qin Yu rolled his eyes.

“Even I might not be able to withstand that palm just now, but you sent it flying with a slap. You’re still pretending to be me?”Qin Yu rolled his eyes.

Yao Qing said with a bit of confusion, “AH? Why Can’t I Understand?”

At this moment, Qin Yu also sensed that something was wrong.

He grabbed Yao Qing’s arm and said, “Just now... that person wasn’t you?”

“Which person?”Yao Qing scratched his head and said.

“I’m so F * cking angry. I put on my clothes and was just about to make an appearance when I F * cking fainted. I didn’t know that bastard knocked me out from behind.”

“When I woke up, I immediately ran back. Fortunately, you guys were fine. Otherwise, I would have become a sinner.”
