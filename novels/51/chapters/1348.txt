Chapter 1349: Chapter 1349, do you know the Keeper of the path 

The great elder glanced at Old Wang and said coldly, “Do I need you to teach me how to do it?”

A trace of panic flashed across Old Wang’s face, and he hurriedly said, “Great Elder, you’ve misunderstood. How could I dare to point fingers in front of you...”

The great elder snorted lightly and didn’t say anything more. He immediately got up and walked out of the Elder’s residence, heading toward the sect master’s room.

He walked all the way to the depths of the heavenly cloud sect.

There was a tall mountain here called the Heavenly Cloud Mountain. It was said that the Heavenly Cloud sect got its name from this mountain.

The Heavenly Cloud Mountain was also where the sect master was located. Usually, he would spend most of his time here comprehending the Dao.

This place was filled with dense mist, and it was like a fairyland.

The sect master sat under a tree. It was said that this tree was a divine tree. Back then, many top experts had attained the DAO under this tree.

The first elder pushed aside the clouds and walked over.

The moment he arrived, he realized that elder Bai was also here.

The first elder frowned and asked, “What are you doing here?”

Elder Bai smiled and cupped his hands. “Greetings, First Elder. I have something important to report to the sect master.”

“Something important? What could it be that you have something important to report?”The first elder snorted.

Elder Bai’s face was full of smiles, but in his heart, he had already greeted all eighteen generations of the first elder’s ancestors.

The first elder coldly said, “I have something important to report to the sect master. You can leave now.”

The originally displeased elder Bai would not listen to the first Elder’s words at this moment.

He chuckled and said, “I’m sorry, First Elder. I also have something to say.”

“I told you to SCRAM. Don’t you understand?”The first elder said with a gloomy face.

Elder Bai said with a faint smile, “First Elder, aren’t you being a little too overbearing?”

“You’re courting death!”

“Enough!”

Just when the first elder was about to make a move, the sect master’s voice came from not far away. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

His figure slowly walked out from the fog like an immortal.

“If you have something to say, just say it. We’re not outsiders,”the sect master said in a deep voice.

Since the sect master had already said so, the first elder did not dare to say anything.

He hurriedly cupped his hands and said, “Yes, sect master.”

After that, the first elder told him what had happened.

“Although that Wen Wanji has some ability, isn’t he a little too much?”The first elder said in a cold voice.

“It has been many years since someone dared to interfere in our heavenly cloud sect’s matters.”

After the sect master heard it, he shook his head.

“Wen Wanye can not be touched,”the sect master said indifferently.

The first elder frowned and said, “Why? Is Our Heavenly Cloud Sect Afraid of Him?”

The sect master glanced at him and said, “A mere Wen Wanye is indeed nothing, but Wen Wanye is a straightforward person and has made many good friends, including Hua Ning Mountain’s unique dance.”

“Once we touch Wen Wanyun, they will definitely help us. When that time comes, it will be troublesome.”

“Unique dance of Mount Hua Ning? That Crazy Woman?”The first elder frowned, and his face didn’t look too good.

It could be seen that they seemed to be more afraid of the unique dance.

The sect master put his hands behind his back and said indifferently, “That’s right, so we can’t Touch Wen Wanyun.”

“Are we going to tolerate his impudence? And that Qin Yu, he...”the great elder couldn’t help but gnash his teeth in anger.

The sect master sighed and said, “Things have to be dealt with. At the very least, there has to be an explanation. Of course, if that Qin Yu is really unable to cultivate because of the twilight qi poison, then he can make up for Ling Yun.”

The Great Elder remained silent. Although he was displeased, he understood the sect master’s intentions.

Elder Bai was terrified when he heard these words.

Once Qin Yu was poisoned by the Twilight Qi, he would definitely be pushed out as an explanation to the outside world!

“No, I have to act immediately...”elder Bai gritted his teeth.

He had to think of a way to intensify the conflict between the two.

...

At this moment, Qin Yu was staying at the Wen family, waiting for the myriad sect gathering.

Although da Yue’s geographical location was not the center of the South Province, many famous events would be held in da Yue.

There was no other reason except that it was probably a place for outstanding people.

Back then, there was a great cultivator at the tribulation stage who walked out of Da Yue.

And his name was da Yue.

In the evening, everyone gathered to eat and drink.

With Wen Da and Wen Er, as well as Jue Wu, these three clowns, there was no lack of joy at the dinner.

Qin Yu, on the other hand, was full of worries and seemed to have something to say.

After eating, Wen Da and Wen er burped and said, “The two of us are going out. A girl asked us out to play.”

Speaking up to this point, Wen da asked Qin Yu, “Are you going?”

Qin Yu shook her head and said, “I’m not going.”

“TSK!”Wen Da waved his hand and turned around to leave the Wen family.

After they left, Qin Yu looked at Wen Wenzi and said, “Master, I have a few questions to ask you.”

“If you have any questions, just say it,”Wen Wenzi said casually.

Jue Wu, who was at the side, widened her eyes and said, “You little meat cushion, why don’t you ask me!”

Qin Yu glanced at her and said, “Don’t interrupt when adults are talking.”

“Little meat cushion, how dare you!”Jue Wu puffed up her cheeks and scolded angrily.

Qin Yu ignored him and looked at Wen wanyi, saying, “Master, do you know the Keeper of the path? and the Yan family of the Central Province?”
