Chapter 1516: Chapter 1,516, attacking the Heavenly Cloud sect

The troops were quickly gathering towards the heavenly cloud sect, and the person leading them was the famous Yongji. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

He stood at the very front, looking awe-inspiring and imposing.

At this moment, the Heavenly Cloud sect had already activated the mountain protection array, and no one came out to fight.

Within the sect, many people raised their heads to look at this scene, and a trace of unease arose in their hearts.

“Since when has our heavenly cloud sect been so overbearing?”Someone whispered to himself.

“Yong Ji finally made his move. That bastard should have been eliminated long ago.”

“It’s useless to talk about this now,”the vice sect master said coldly.

He looked at everyone and said, “This mountain protection array was personally set up by the sect master. I’m afraid Yong Ji won’t be able to come in for a while. Everyone, there’s no need to panic.”

As he spoke, Yong Ji spoke from above.

“Sect master of the Heavenly Cloud Sect, Yong Ji is here to pay a visit. Why Don’t you come out and have a chat?”

Yong Ji’s voice was like rolling thunder, shaking the Heaven and earth.

“Damn it, what is this bird pretending to be? If the sect master didn’t go into seclusion, would he dare to come?”Someone coldly snorted.

The deputy sect master raised his head and looked at Yong Ji. His feet shook and he rose up from the ground, instantly reaching the same height as Yong Ji.

......

“Mister Yong Ji, why are you making such a big fuss?”The deputy sect leader asked faintly.

Yong Ji laughed loudly and said, “Deputy sect leader, don’t pretend to be ignorant. The actions of the Heavenly Cloud sect are vicious and the people of the world have long been dissatisfied. Today, i, Yong Ji, want to seek justice for the world.”

“Oh? If that’s the case, why doesn’t Mister Yong Ji imitate Xiao Hai and Jue Wu and head to the northern border?”The deputy sect leader laughed coldly.

Yong Ji had already made preparations. He said with a faint smile, “To resist the outside world, we must first settle down within. We can’t let the Southern Region fall into a situation of internal and external troubles.”

The deputy sect leader narrowed his eyes and said, “Mister Yong Ji, are you sure you want to make an enemy out of My Tianyun sect? When the sect leader comes out of seclusion, he will definitely find trouble with you!”

Yong Ji laughed out loud and said, “That will depend on whether he has the opportunity!”

After saying this, the aura of the many people behind Yong Ji instantly exploded! The internal Qi of the people behind Yong Ji instantly exploded!

Such a dense aura directly shattered the surrounding space, revealing a large area of empty space!

The deputy sect leader didn’t waste any more words and immediately returned to the Heavenly Cloud sect.

The entire sect lit up, enveloping the entire heavenly cloud sect.

“What? The Great Heavenly Cloud sect is planning to be a cowardly turtle?”Yong Ji said coldly.

The deputy sect master shouted, “Yong Ji, you are just a petty person who takes advantage of others’danger. You will never be able to become a noble person in your life!”

“Hehe, this is not something you can decide,”Yong Ji said coldly.

Then, he took a step back and waved his hand, shouting, “Do it! Break his mountain protection array!”

“Yes!”

Many adopted sons lit up their spells one after another. In an instant, the sky was brightly lit.

A terrifying airwave enveloped a large area of land. The first to be affected was boss Zheng’s an Fenglou.

He brought his men and hurriedly fled from an Fenglou, but even so, he was still injured by the lingering power and could not stop vomiting blood.

Round after round of spells came close to the Heavenly Cloud Sect’s mountain protection array. What was shocking was that the mountain protection array was actually intact. Under such a terrifying attack, it was still unaffected.

“As expected of the spell formation personally set up by the Heavenly Cloud Sect’s sect master,”someone said in a low voice.

“The sect master of the Heavenly Cloud sect is a legend of the southern region. I’m afraid Yong Ji is still hiding in some unknown corner when he’s fighting everywhere.”

“If he can’t even break the spell formation, how can he attack the Heavenly Cloud Sect?”

Above, Yong Ji’s face was ashen. He didn’t expect that so many people couldn’t even do anything to a single spell formation.

“Everyone, stop.”Yong Ji took a step forward. He lowered his head and looked down at the heavenly cloud sect as he slowly raised his palm.

Internal Qi gathered in his palm. It was extremely terrifying. Everyone felt an unprecedented pressure at this moment.

“It’s Yong Ji’s three Yuan Holy Palm!”Someone saw through this spell!

Yong Ji raised his hand as his trump card, intending to shatter this mountain protection spell formation in one go!

“Break for me!”

Along with Yong Ji’s furious roar, the three Yuan holy palm stacked on top of each other like an ocean wave. Everything in the surroundings turned into ashes in an instant. It was incomparably terrifying!

“Boom!”

After the three Yuan holy palm stacked on top of each other, its power was boundless. The moment it touched the array, the entire heavenly cloud sect rumbled!

Within the sect, mountain rocks tumbled down and the earth collapsed. It was as if an earthquake had occurred.

Everyone couldn’t help but tremble in fear.

“It’s over. The mountain protection array can’t take it anymore,”someone said in alarm.

“If Yong Ji barges in, who can fight him?”

“Without the sect master, who can fight Yong Ji?”

The returning to void stage artifact of the Heavenly Cloud sect had been taken away, and the current Yong Ji could be said to be invincible!

“It’s all your fault! I even suspect that you are a spy for Yongji!”Someone pointed the spear at the deputy sect leader.

The deputy sect leader didn’t say anything. He stared at the faintly discernible array and took a deep breath.

He stretched out his palm, and a large saber appeared in his hand.

Clearly, the deputy sect leader was prepared to die in battle.

But just as everyone was wailing, the array actually flashed with light again!

Meanwhile, Yong Ji’s three Yuan holy palm slowly dissipated.

“Phew.”

Seeing this scene, everyone heaved a long sigh of relief.

“Fortunately, the sect master’s array is better...”someone sighed.

Although the Heavenly Cloud sect wasn’t created by the sect master alone, it had indeed flourished in his hands. His strength was naturally self-evident.

Meanwhile, in the outside world, Yong Ji’s expression immediately became even more unsightly.

The three elements holy palm was his trump card, but he had already been defeated twice.

The first time was when Hua Zi was defeated by Jue Wu’s all creation smallpox when he fought against Qin Yu. This time, it was him who personally attacked, but he was unable to break through even a mountain protection array.

“Even the three elements holy palm was unable to break through the mountain protection array. Looks like this attack is going to end in failure,”someone commented.

“Not necessarily. As one of the three unique skills, Yongji naturally has more than one three elements holy palm. Moreover, not only does he have a unique skill, but he also has an extremely terrifying magical artifact.”

Just as everyone was discussing, Yongji reached out with his palm and took out a long pole.

This pole flickered with a purple-gold light. The light was like a mist that lingered around it, making it look mysterious and unfathomable.

“It’s the purple-gold pole.”Someone Gasped.

“Looks like Yong Ji has made up his mind this time.”

Yong Ji held the purple-gold pole in his hand. With an angry shout, the purple-gold pole in his hand seemed to split the heavens and earth apart as it headed straight for the Heavenly Cloud Sect’s Mountain Protection Spell Formation!

“Boom!”

With one strike, the heavens and earth collapsed, and everything within the Heavenly Cloud sect was shattered!

With another strike, the Heavenly Cloud Sect’s mountain protection spell formation became much dimmer!

Finally, under the third strike, the array could no longer hold on and began to collapse!
