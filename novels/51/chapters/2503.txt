2504 The War Begins

However, the people behind the little loli were closely protected by her. They were not affected at all.

The terrifying power erupted between the halberd and the hand and condensed at the fist.

A terrifying energy cluster was condensed within this one-foot distance.

As the two clashed, Qin Yu’s eardrums felt a rumble.

A wave of the microscopic level directly shattered his eardrums, causing his world to fall silent.

The surrounding people looked like shouting, but their voices could not transmit through their mouths.

The air around them seemed to have been replaced by another ability.

In the darkness of the night, the energy cluster between his hands and halberd flickered like radiant pearls.

Whenever the energy cluster appeared, it would tear through the dark sky and illuminate everything in the surroundings.

It then quickly returned to darkness. In the blink of an eye, the lightning emitted by the energy cluster emanated a dazzling white light in the sky, illuminating all the things on the ground.

The branches and leaves of the trees flickered with a silver-white light under the illumination of the lightning. The outline of the buildings was noticeably visible, and the mountains were faintly discernible, illuminated by the lightning.

Everyone’s world instantly turned black and white. This attack lasted for nearly 20 breaths before it stopped.

When the energy calmed down, Qin Yu could finally breathe deeply.

He greedily inhaled the oxygen in the sky, and his body was drenched in cold sweat.

When the powers beyond the fifth level clashed, they were as if facing the true might of heaven and earth.

The only feeling Qin Yu had was that he was so small.

In the face of such power, Qin Yu felt he could instantly turn into a powder even if he touched it slightly.

“The monster race general, Xiang Yu.”

The little loli’s face turned slightly pale, and she seemed to have used up much more energy than Xiang Yu to halt the explosion of the energy.

“I didn’t expect the joint attacks of the monster race to be so terrifying. They actually leveled up the attack on Xiang Yu to the same level as the sect master of the Divine Night Sect.”

The expression of Su Xinghe from Kunlun was ugly.

What he was frightened of was this eight-winged monster race seemed to have strength at the early stage of the fifth level.

This meant that this monster race army was still in the growing stage.

Who could resist this monster race army if there were more Path of Demon sacrificial rituals to refine this monster race?

Previously, the monster race had set up a trap on the Solitary Shadow Continent and even mobilized the rare heavenly monster race.

It was to avoid attracting the attention of the higher-ups of the human race.

The greatest monster race’s Path of Heaven’s sacrificial ritual was finally completed with the coordination of the demon race’s attack and formed a formidable army.

At this moment, Xiang Yu’s body was sent flying. This time, he seemed to be at a disadvantage.

The enormous demonic body flew backward, smashing countless rocks.

However, he stood up as if nothing had happened and pulled out the halberd that was stabbed into his chest.

A large piece of flesh was torn out along with the halberd. A terrifying wound appeared on the chest, and the wound’s flesh wiggled rapidly and recovered at a tremendous speed. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“Surround all these alien races and kill them!”

Su Xinghe slashed out a sword, and a large area of the demon race’s territory was instantly razed to the ground.

“You’re still so hot-tempered.”

Immortal Crane was sitting on the chair as if it did not see Su Xinghe’s attack.

Following the attack of the monster race general, Xiang Yu, the human race began to surround the three races.

In terms of numbers, the human race far exceeded the other three races combined.

After all, this was the human race’s home territory, the Holy Region. Furthermore, as the battle progressed, more and more of the human race would provide support continuously.

Other than a large number of the demon race, the ghost race and the monster race had to cross a vast space before they could reach this place.

As Su Xinghe pointed forward, this fierce battle officially began.

The human race and the other three races fought each other. The heaven and earth was a tragic scene, and a dense killing intent spread in the air.

On the battlefield, the human and the alien race engaged in a desperate battle like a violent storm.

Swords and sabers clashed, techniques flew everywhere, explosions and screams echoed in the sky above the battlefield.

Blood and flesh flew everywhere, and there were mountains of corpses and seas of blood.

The human race and other living beings on the ground were covered in blood. Their faces contorted in pain and despair.

The corpses of the alien and human race piled up like mountains, forming a terrifying barrier.

This was a real war for the race’s survival that would not be held back.

The battlefield was filled with the smell of smoke and scorched earth, and the burning flames lit up the entire battlefield.

On the contrary, battle above the fifth level was much lesser, and these higher-ups were restraining each other.

Other than He Teng, who had gone mad, the others were silently watching the situation on the battlefield.

Within two hours, the human race suffered heavy casualties, but the alien race suffered several times more.

In terms of numbers, the human race would definitely benefit greatly.

Su Xinghe frowned, feeling a trace of unease for some reason.

The demon race could reproduce.

Coupled with the monster and the ghost race, the combined attacks were not at a disadvantage against the human race. However, this attack was noticeably more disadvantageous to the other three races.

If they were to launch a full-scale attack, the death rate would probably be 1:1.5. Why were the three races obsessed with this kind of attack?

“He Teng, get the f*ck out of my way.”

Qin Yu’s body twisted and turned, using the spatial power of the origin to shuttle continuously to avoid He Teng’s attacks.

A Yin Yang Sword qi slashed out, but it only left a shallow sword mark on He Teng’s body.

In the blink of an eye, it healed at a tremendous speed.

If it wasn’t for the fact that his spatial power of the origin had become more profound, he would have been smashed into a meat patty by He Teng in no time.

“Don’t run, Qin Yu. Hand over my arm!”

He Teng suddenly descended from the sky and pressed his palm down slightly in the void.

In an instant, the air was compressed to the extreme. Even the spatial power of the origin of the Path of Heaven was weakened significantly.

“D*mn it, this lunatic wants to fight me to the death!”

Qin Yu cursed. The key was that he could not beat him.

Even though he had opened six major acupoints and possessed the Glazed Holy Body, he dared not take on He Teng’s physical strength.

The monster race’s Path of Heaven had modified his current body, and his strength had reached a terrifying level.

Other than the third move of Evil Eye, the God-slaying Dusk, Qin Yu had no other moves that could withstand He Teng’s physical strength.

As the power fluctuated, a spatial fluctuation surged again.

Shuttle!

Qin Yu was shocked. He formed a spatial spell with one hand.

In the distance, a spatial coordinate suddenly lit up and pulled his body out.

With his other hand, he slashed out another sword energy almost instantly. That sword energy exploded directly on He Teng’s chest.

The wheel of the Soul Ferry lit up in his soul. The terrifying soul-sucking power tore his soul apart, causing his hand movements to slow down slightly.
