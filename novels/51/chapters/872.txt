Chapter 873: Chapter 873, ice and snow glazed heart in hand 

The palace master immediately panicked. He shouted with all his might, “Junior, you dare!”

Qin Yu sneered, “Why wouldn’t I Dare!”

As he spoke, Qin Yu clenched his fist and threw a punch at his nascent soul that had yet to form!

Although this punch was not very powerful, it made the nascent soul dim a little!

Not only that, the main body of the palace master also trembled slightly!

This immediately made the palace master panic. he shouted desperately, “No, no! As long as you are willing to let me go, I can agree to any conditions!”

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “No. To me, your greatest value is to be able to provide me with your nascent soul.”

After saying that, Qin Yu punched his nascent soul again.

His nascent soul dimmed a little, and his body spat out a mouthful of blood!

The palace master’s face was Pale, and his heart was extremely unwilling!

He had waited for so many years just to step into the nascent soul realm today!

But never did he expect that at this critical moment, everything would be destroyed in an instant!

“Junior, I’ll fight it out with you!”Seeing that Qin Yu was unmoved, the palace master seemed to have gone mad and started to roar!

Then, his nascent soul started to shine and then started to expand!

Waves of terrifying power spread out from his nascent soul! The entire cold palace started to Rumble!

“Not good!”Seeing this, Qin Yu’s expression immediately changed!

“He wants to self-destruct his nascent soul!”

Qin Yu didn’t dare to think too much. He grabbed the icy snow glazed heart and turned around, wanting to escape!

That nascent soul was still expanding, and the terrifying power seemed to have split apart at this moment!

Qin Yu turned around and ran out of the cold palace, while Zhang Yijiu, who was guarding the door, clearly didn’t know the situation.

“What happened?”Zhang Yijiu asked in puzzlement.

Qin Yu hurriedly said, “Get down quickly!”

The force was getting stronger and stronger. With a loud bang, a blast of air that was like a nuclear bomb exploded from the cold palace! Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

The power of a self-detonation of a nascent soul was unimaginable!

Even if it was just an unformed nascent soul, it still contained the power to destroy the world!

With a loud boom, the entire cold palace was turned into snow!

Qin Yu’s body was sent flying!

At a glance, a flame soared into the sky. The entire ice surface seemed to be on fire!

Under the tremendous impact, the snow mountains within hundreds of meters collapsed. For a moment, it was as if an avalanche had been triggered!

The explosion lasted for more than ten minutes, and everything in the surroundings instantly turned into nothingness.

It was originally a world of ice and snow, but in the blink of an eye, it was as if he had arrived at the top of the ocean!

Under the cover of the heavy snow, Qin Yu climbed out with great difficulty.

Half of his body was cracked from the impact, and his internal organs were also greatly impacted.

“Wow!”

He opened his mouth and spat out a mouthful of blood.

Qin Yu tried to move his limbs, and he found that he was in pain all over his body.

“F * ck...”Qin Yu couldn’t help but curse.

“Is this the power of a self-detonation of a nascent soul...”

One had to know that this was only an unformed nascent soul!

If it was a complete nascent soul, Qin Yu would probably turn into blood instantly!

Qin Yu endured the pain in his body and took out the heart of ice and snow from his space artifact.

The heart of ice and snow in Qin Yu’s hand was emitting a light blue light. It was the color of the blue sky and the sea, which made people feel quite comfortable.

Qin Yu caressed the heart of ice and snow and said with some excitement, “Fortunately, I got the heart of ice and snow. It’s just a pity for that nascent soul.”

He thought that he could devour his nascent soul, but he didn’t expect that the palace master would choose to self-destruct at the last moment.

Qin Yu tried to feel the glazed ice heart, but he found that he couldn’t feel any Qi/spiritual energy in it.

“Strange, how should I use this thing?”Qin Yu frowned.

He got the thing, but he didn’t know how to use it for cultivation.

At this moment, Qin Yu suddenly thought of Zhang Yi Jiu.

“She might know.”Qin Yu hurriedly put away his ice glaze heart.

He released his internal Qi and sensed Zhang Yi Jiu’s aura.

Soon, Qin Yu felt a weak internal Qi under the heavy snow.

Qin Yu strode forward. He pushed open the snow mountain with his palm and found Zhang Yi Jiu, whose aura was weak.

Qin Yu stretched out his hand and checked her breathing.

‘she should still be alive,’Qin Yu thought to himself.

Then, Qin Yu injected a trace of Qi/spiritual energy into her and temporarily held her life.

‘after I get the ice and snow glazed heart, it’s time for me to go back and report to my superiors,’Qin Yu thought to himself.

He originally wanted to go to these three organizations in person, but after seeing the palace master’s cultivation, Qin Yu changed his mind.

It was imminent for him to step into the martial saint realm. No one knew if there would be anyone who would step into the martial saint realm soon after the New Year.

Qin Yu could not afford to be delayed.

Initially, he wanted to leave immediately. Unfortunately, in this world filled with heavy snow, Qin Yu could not find his way.

With no other choice, Qin Yu could only bring Zhang Yi Jiu to a safe place.

He stretched out his palm and placed it on Zhang Yi Jiu’s chest, slowly healing his injuries.

This explosion had injured Zhang Yi Jiu extremely badly.

Her clothes were almost shattered, revealing a large patch of snow-white skin.

It had to be said that Zhang Yi Jiu’s looks and figure were both perfect.

Her fair skin coupled with her slender thighs made people unable to stop looking at her.

Qin Yu turned his face to the side and silently channeled Qi/spiritual energy to her.

Following the injection of traces of internal Qi, Zhang Yi Jiu’s body emitted traces of white qi.

After an unknown amount of time, Zhang Yi Jiu, who was lying on the ground, finally coughed.

She slowly opened her eyes and said in a trembling voice, “I’m so hot... So Hot...”

“Hot?”Qin Yu could not help but frown.

“On such a cold day, you say you’re Hot? Are you crazy?”

However, Zhang Yi Jiu kept grabbing his body and said in a trembling voice, “I’m so hot... So Hot!”

After saying that, Zhang Yi Jiu suddenly threw himself into Qin Yu’s arms!

Her body was extremely hot, and her body was constantly emitting white smoke.

Not only that, Zhang Yi Jiu’s hands kept touching Qin Yu’s body.

“This is... Aphrodisiac Poison?”Qin Yu frowned slightly and suddenly thought of a word.
