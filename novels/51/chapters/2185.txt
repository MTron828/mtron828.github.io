2186 Self-created Dao Technique!

Qin Yu’s physical body shattered again, and blood gushed out. Almost no part of his body remained intact.

However, even though Qin Yu’s physical body shattered repeatedly, his will never wavered. He was unwilling to fail just like that. He was determined to find a way to break through.

Qin Yu gathered his physical body again. He stood up, and his eyes flickered with unwavering determination. He began to think and recall his battle with Wu Ji, trying to find a loophole.

There seemed to be no time limit for this battle. Qin Yu could not retreat but only face the difficulties head-on and try to find the slightest loophole in the repeated clashes.

Measured by conventional time, this battle had already lasted for dozens of days.

In the span of dozens of days, Qin Yu’s physical body had already shattered numerous times. If not for the fact that this battle was completely based on the resistance of his physical body, his internal qi would have long dried up, and he would have died!

Such a long-lasting battle was something Qin Yu had never encountered before. Not only Qin Yu but even Wu Ji’s incarnation also began to have a trace of emotion in his eyes!

There was no other reason than Qin Yu’s improvement speed was too fast!

His physical body shattered repeatedly, but he had become stronger after each rebirth!

From the initial moment of defeat to the gradual and prolonged confrontations, Wu Ji had never encountered such an opponent before!

Of course, it was only a clone formed by the Path of Heaven. It was not the real Wu Ji, but it contained a large portion of Wu Ji’s dao techniques! Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“No, no!” Qin Yu threw a punch, but he somehow felt that something was wrong!

“No, it’s still not right!”

The feeling made Qin Yu increasingly irritated. In the blink of an eye, he unleashed hundreds of punches, shattering the world countless times!

In his mind, a bright light seemed about to appear but was blocked by something.

“No, it’s not right!”

Qin Yu raised his head and roared angrily, unleashing all his internal qi on this punch!

“Boom!”

After throwing this punch, all of Qin Yu’s physical strength was instantly depleted, and he did not even have the slightest strength to stand up!

He squatted on the ground, completely ignoring the approaching Wu Ji!

“Where exactly is the problem exactly from…” Qin Yu was as if possessed. Cold sweat flowed down his forehead, and his eyes kept darting around. His mind was chaotic but clear at the same time as if he was about to comprehend something but nothing!

Qin squatted on the ground, covered in blood, his body trembling and on the verge of collapse. Cold sweat dripped from his forehead, his eyes filled with confusion and burning intensity. He felt an indescribable sense of panic and excitement overwhelming him.

Qin Yu’s fingers trembled as he continuously clenched and released them as if fighting a battle with his inner turmoil. His lips quivered a little as if he wanted to say something, but in the end, there were only silent murmurs.

“I can’t fail… What exactly has gone wrong…”

Qin Yu’s voice was weak but firm, and his eyes flickered with determination. He knew this was his only chance. He could not let down his hard work and persistence.

He slowly closed his eyes and took a deep breath, trying to calm down. His heart shook violently, and his thoughts were as intense as a storm. However, he tried his best to suppress his disorganized thoughts and focus on finding that key point.

Time seemed to have stopped, and everything around him became blurry. Qin Yu only felt the restlessness and endless desire in his heart. He needed to find that answer. He needed to break through this predicament.

Just as he was about to feel despair, a light flashed across his mind. He frowned and focused his mind, trying to seize the moment of that flash.

Slowly, that flash of light became clearer, like a lonely star, shining in Qin Yu’s mind.

“I know now. I understand now!” At this critical moment, Qin Yu suddenly stood up!

There was only one reason he could not defeat Wu Ji no matter what. Qin Yu had been fighting against him within Wu Ji’s dao technique!

Therefore, no matter how fast Qin Yu’s improvement was, he could not surpass the creator of this dao technique!

“There’s only one way to defeat Wu Ji. That is to create my own dao technique…” Qin Yu murmured, instantly understanding everything!

Meanwhile, the sky began to clear up. The originally rolling dark clouds also shot out a ray of light!

The dark clouds in the sky gradually dissipated, and a blue sky replaced them. The sunlight shone down, illuminating the earth, making it bright and warm.

Qin Yu raised his head and looked up. His eyes flickered with hope and determination. He felt the warmth of the sunlight as if the power of the universe had a subtle resonance with him.

The breeze caressed his face, and the gentle touch made him feel calm and peaceful. He stared at the sky and felt the changes.

After the dark clouds dissipated, the sky regained its clarity and tranquility. White clouds floated in the air as soft and light cotton candy.

Sunlight shone through the gaps between the clouds, casting colorful shadows. The light pierced through the clouds like magical beams, illuminating everything on the ground.

The blue sky became purer, like a clear lake. Qin Yu stared at the sky and felt the tranquility and determination in his heart.

Seeing such a strange sight, Qin Yu could not help but have a hint of doubt in his heart.

“Strange, could it be that this heavenly tribulation is not to get rid of me…” Qin Yu murmured.

Cultivation was indeed against the heavens, which was why there was a heavenly tribulation. Therefore, the heavenly tribulation would definitely do its best to eliminate the cultivator.

However, the azure blue sky made Qin Yu waver slightly.

Even Wu Ji, who was brimming with battle intent, stopped in his tracks at this moment. He only stood in the distance and quietly looked at Qin Yu.

Qin Yu no longer dwelled on it. Since that was the case, he could only create his own dao technique to resist this Wu Ji’s clone.

He sat cross-legged and began comprehending the dao technique by himself, fusing everything.

Qin Yu sat cross-legged, immersed in his comprehension. He closed his eyes and focused on his inner world.

In the depths of his heart, he felt powerful energy surging like a river, gathering endlessly in his body. He started to focus his mind and sense the pulse and changes of this energy.

His heart was like a universe filled with endless possibilities. He began to observe his body, soul, and consciousness, trying to find the link that connected them.

Qin Yu’s consciousness gradually went deeper and entered a boundless space. In this space, he saw runes flickering with light. They floated like stars, emitting mysterious and formidable power.

These runes were his own dao technique, the traces of his cultivation, and the key to his control of power. Qin Yu began to observe these runes, pondering the profundities within, word by word.
