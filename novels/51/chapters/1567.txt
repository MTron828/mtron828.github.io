Chapter 1568: Chapter 1,568: the collapse of the Cultivation Mountain! 1 Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Heavenly Blood Rainbow’s voice could not help but make Qin Yu feel delighted.

He hurriedly used his divine sense to ask, “What do you mean?”

Heavenly Blood Rainbow said in a deep voice, “According to my speculation, the reason why the northern lands obtained the inheritance of the immortal slaying sect is very likely because it was once a relic of the immortal slaying sect...”

Qin Yu frowned slightly, as if he had understood something.

“In other words... many years ago, the northern lands was a relic of the immortal slaying sect, but after a great war, it led to the destruction of the immortal slaying sect’s relic in the Holy Region? So it left behind the inheritance?”Qin Yu guessed.

Heavenly Blood Rainbow said in a deep voice, “I think so too...”

Qin Yu touched his chin. He thought of the immortal slaying sect’s relic on Earth.

In comparison, that place seemed to be much smaller than the northern lands.

“As expected, the immortal slaying sect has been to the Holy Region,”Qin Yu thought to himself.

“It’s not just the holy region. When the immortal slaying sect was at its peak, how could there be no traces of the immortal slaying sect in the entire universe?”Heavenly Blood Rainbow’s tone carried a hint of pride.

However, Qin Yu was not in the mood to pay attention to him. At this moment, all he could think about was how to go to the northern lands to cultivate.

If he had the opportunity to go to the northern lands, not only would he have the opportunity to obtain the inheritance of the immortal slaying sect, he would also be able to borrow the dark energy of the northern lands to cultivate.

“Qin Yu, what are you thinking about?”Xiao Hai asked from the side.

......

Qin Yu shook his head and smiled, “It’s nothing. Senior Xiao Hai, sorry to disturb you. I’ll go back and rest first.”

Following that, Qin Yu turned around and left Xiao Hai’s room.

At night, Qin Yu lay on his bed, his mind full of thoughts on this matter.

It was simply impossible to cross the Dead River unless one used the spatial teleportation formation.

However, in the vast southern province, only the Tianyun sect seemed to have this formation.

Not only that, the Tianyun sect was extremely secretive about this formation and rarely used it.

“It seems that if we want to head to the northern lands, we still have to wait for the two major plates to come together,”Qin Yu sighed.

In the next few days, the northern lands did not take any action. The northern borders ushered in a rare peace.

However, everyone knew that the northern lands was definitely planning something. They would not give up on the fertile land of the southern plains.

At the same time, the three godly monarchs of the northern lands had already set off and entered the southern plains.

Heavenly Cloud sect.

The three godly monarchs were looking coldly at the Cultivation Mountain.

“The person on the mountain is the sect master of the Heavenly Cloud Sect, right?”One of them said.

“That’s right. Rumor has it that the sect master of the Heavenly Cloud sect has been in seclusion on the cultivation mountain for several days.”

“Seclusion? I’m afraid that by the time he comes out of seclusion, he will have already stepped into the reversion void stage. At that time, I’m afraid there’s really no chance of getting rid of him.”

The three of them looked at each other and immediately came to the same conclusion.

In the end, they still went against Sima Bei’s will and decided to look for the sect master of the Heavenly Cloud sect.

The three of them leaped up and stood above the Heavenly Cloud sect.

These three people were the strongest experts in the northern lands, and their strength was incomparably terrifying.

Rumor has it that these three people already had half a foot into the reversion void stage, and were even more powerful than Sima bei!

The Heavenly Cloud Sect’s defense was simply not enough in front of these three people.

As they raised their palms, a terrifying light seemed to come from beyond the heavens!

In front of their powerful strength, the Heavenly Cloud Sect’s mountain protection formation was as if it was nothing, and it instantly collapsed!

“What’s Going On!”

The deputy sect leader immediately sensed the abnormality, and he hurriedly got up and walked out of the room.

Looking at the three black-robed men in front of him, the deputy sect leader’s expression changed slightly.

The powerful internal Qi of these three people made the deputy sect master feel a trace of unease.

“Fellow Daoists, why did you attack my Tianyun Sect?”The deputy sect master questioned.

The three people glanced at the deputy sect master before waving their large hands. A terrifying internal Qi came straight for the deputy sect master!

The deputy sect master’s expression changed drastically. He hurriedly used a spell to resist, but the three godly monarchs were too powerful. It was not something the deputy sect master could resist.

“Boom!”

At the moment of contact, the deputy sect master was sent flying!

His body collapsed, his bones were broken, and his internal Qi narrowed to the extreme in an instant!

“A mere ant dares to open his mouth to question. He doesn’t know death,”one of the godly monarchs said coldly.

The deputy sect master opened his mouth, wanting to say something, but the injuries on his body made it extremely difficult for him to even open his mouth.

After that, the three people walked straight towards the cultivation mountain.

The cultivation mountain shimmered like an immortal mountain.

It was unknown what technique the Heavenly Cloud Sect’s sect master had used to actually seal the entire mountain.

“This level of spiritual qi is something that our northern lands can only hope for but can not seek,”one of the godly monarchs said coldly.

“That’s right. This place is truly a land of outstanding people.”The other godly monarch also nodded slightly.

“Once we step into the South Province, we will settle down here.”

With that said, the three of them raised their palms at the same time. Streams of black energy shot out from their palms!

In a short moment, the black energy condensed into a large hand and smacked viciously at the Cultivation Mountain!

“Boom!”

With a palm strike, the entire cultivation mountain trembled!

And the radiance that lingered outside the cultivation mountain dimmed a few times under this palm strike!

“What’s going on? What happened? !”

For a moment, the entire heavenly cloud sect was alarmed!

They raised their heads to look at the three black-robed men, and their expressions changed drastically!

“Who are they? They are actually attacking the Cultivation Mountain!”

“That is the sect master’s seclusion area. Quickly stop them!”

“The three of you, Stop!”

For a moment, the entire Heavenly Cloud sect was in chaos, but the three godly monarchs completely ignored them. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“Don’t... Don’t speak...”

At this moment, the deputy sect master shouted these words with all his might.

Only then did everyone realize the dying deputy sect master. They hurriedly walked in front of the deputy sect master and said in alarm, “Deputy sect master, you... What Happened to you? What happened? Who are those three people?”

The deputy sect master said with a trembling voice, “Their strength... is beyond our imagination. We must not make a move...”

With the strength of the three godly monarchs, attacking them at this moment was no different from throwing an egg at a rock. It was no different from throwing away one’s life.

At this moment, the gigantic palm struck at the Cultivation Mountain once again!

“Boom!”

Under the second palm strike, the Cultivation Mountain’s radiance seemed to be unable to hold on any longer and began to tremble violently!

“HMPH, this enchantment is only SO-SO.”The three godly monarchs said with a sneer.

Following that, the three of them attacked again. The third palm struck the Cultivation Mountain!

“Boom!”

Following the third palm strike, the Cultivation Mountain’s radiance could no longer withstand it!

The seven-colored glazed light was like glass as it began to break apart piece by piece! The true face of the cultivation mountain could be seen at a glance!

The three of them exchanged glances and strode into the Cultivation Mountain!

They saw a figure with his back facing them under a tree on the cultivation mountain.

“Sect master of the Tianyun sect, I’ve heard a lot about you.”One of the godly monarchs said coldly.
