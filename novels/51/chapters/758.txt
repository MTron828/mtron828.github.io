Chapter 759: Treasure Gourd Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Qin Yu’s hand was tightly grasping the wrists of the two old men.

The internal qi of both sides collided in the dark, causing the air to explode.

Luo Yang glanced at Qin Yu and said indifferently, “It makes sense.”

Qin Yu released the two old men. The moment he released them, the two men immediately said in a cold voice, “Kid, you have some strength.”

Qin Yu didn’t pay attention to them. He looked at Luo Yang and said, “Young Master Luo, since you said that my friend’s stuff are all scrap metal, then what treasure are you prepared to give out?”

Luo Yang snorted lightly. He stretched out his palm, and a treasure instantly fell into his palm.

This treasure flickered with a strange light in his palm. The light was quite dazzling, and for a moment, it was impossible to see what it was.

After ten seconds, the light gradually dimmed and revealed its true appearance.

A dagger was placed in Luo Yang’s palm.

There were dragon patterns carved on the dagger. The dragon patterns looked natural and obviously came from a master.

“Divine Dragon Blade?” The man with the mustache seemed to recognize this treasure.

Luo Yang smiled nonchalantly and said, “Not bad, you know the Divine Dragon Blade. It seems that you have some skills.”

The man with the mustache kept silent and stared at the Divine Dragon Blade.

A moment later, the man with the mustache frowned and said, “No, this dagger looks like the Divine Dragon Blade, but it has flaws.”

He pointed at the dragon pattern on the dagger and said, “The real Divine Dragon Blade has dark red dragon patterns. It is said that it is made with the blood of a saint, but this one is bright red.”

“If I’m not wrong, this Divine Dragon Blade is a high-quality imitation, right?”

Luo Yang frowned slightly and a trace of displeasure flashed across his face.

A moment later, Luo Yang smiled nonchalantly and said, “That’s right. This is indeed a high-quality imitation. If it’s the real Divine Dragon Blade, do you think I would be willing to exchange it for this shabby gourd?”

Having said that, Luo Yang changed the topic and continued, “But even if it’s a high-quality imitation, its power cannot be underestimated.”

After he finished speaking, Luo Yang grabbed the Divine Dragon Blade in his hand and lightly waved it in front of him.

An extremely powerful light instantly surged out!

This powerful energy almost shattered the void!

It even left behind a trace on the wall!

Even Qin Yu couldn’t help but be slightly stunned by such power.

Just a mere imitation had such power. If it was an authentic one, how much power would it display?

The stall vendor was even more stunned. He swallowed hard and said, “Young Master Luo, I’m willing to trade with you!”

A subtle smile flashed across Luo Yang’s face.

“Hold on.” At this moment, Qin Yu suddenly shouted.

Luo Yang frowned slightly and said unhappily, “What?”

Qin Yu smiled and said, “I have a treasure here too. You can take a look.”

The vendor frowned as he looked at Qin Yu. His eyes were filled with anticipation.

Qin Yu flipped his palm and a pill fell into his palm.

The pill was purple in color and had a hint of medicinal fragrance on it.

“What is this?” The vendor asked doubtfully.

Qin Yu said indifferently, “Purple-gold Pill.”

“Purple-gold Pill?”

Hearing this, everyone present couldn’t help but exclaim!

Even Luo Yang couldn’t help but be tempted.

“Not bad.” Qin Yu nodded.

“This Purple-gold Pill was personally refined by me.”

Luo Yang couldn’t help but sneer. “You personally refined it? Do you know that there are very few people in the world who can refine this pill?”

“That’s right. According to what I know, other than the Pavilion Master of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion, there seems to be few people who can refine this pill.” The elder beside Luo Yang also said.

Qin Yu glanced at him and said, “That’s right, but I’m an elder of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion. It’s not difficult for me to refine this pill.”

“An elder of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion?” Luo Yang frowned slightly.

“Who exactly are you?”

“He is Qin Yu!” The man with the mustache hurriedly jumped out and said.

By now, this name had already spread throughout the world!

Even the stall owner had heard of Qin Yu’s great name!

“You are Qin Yu?” Luo Yang narrowed his eyes slightly.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “That’s right.”

After saying that, Qin Yu looked at the stall owner and said with a smile, “I don’t need to say much about the use of this Purple-gold pill. It should be more valuable than the high-quality imitation of the Divine Dragon Blade.”

The stall owner swallowed hard and kept nodding. “Yes, yes...”

“What’s your choice?” Qin Yu asked directly.

The stall owner glanced at Luo Yang and then at Qin Yu.

Then, he gritted his teeth and said, “I choose the Purple-gold Pill!” Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

After saying that, he snatched the Purple-gold Pill.

Qin Yu smiled and nodded. He picked up the gourd from the ground and said with a smile, “This gourd belongs to me.”

Luo Yang’s expression was a little ugly.

He looked at Qin Yu coldly and said, “Qin Yu, you made enemies on all sides. Haven’t you thought about the consequences?”

Qin Yu glanced at Luo Yang and said, “What do you mean, Young Master Luo?”

Luo Yang snorted coldly and said, “You’ve already offended a lot of people. Don’t tell me you want to add the Pavilion of Heavenly Secrets to your list of enemies?”

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and said, “Young Master Luo, are you threatening me?”

“You can understand it that way,” Luo Yang said coldly.

“If you’re willing to give me this gourd, I can pretend that what happened today didn’t happen. Otherwise... you’ll bear the consequences!”

Qin Yu’s expression gradually turned cold.

“I hate people who threaten me the most in my life. Luo Yang, if you can represent the Pavilion of Heavenly Secrets, then it seems that the Pavilion of Heavenly Secrets isn’t that impressive,” Qin Yu said coldly.

“Okay!” Luo Yang closed the folding fan in his hand and said coldly, “Let’s wait and see!”

After saying this, Luo Yang turned around and left.

Qin Yu couldn’t be bothered with Luo Yang.

Calling him Young Master Luo was a sign of respect.

If he didn’t, he would be a nobody.

After taking the gourd, Qin Yu and the man with the mustache left the stall.

“What’s the background of the Pavilion of Heavenly Secrets?” Qin Yu asked.

The man with the mustache said in a deep voice, “The Pavilion of Heavenly Secrets is similar to the Divine Alchemist Pavilion, but the Divine Alchemist pavilion refines medicine while the Pavilion of Heavenly Secrets refines weapons.”

“Luo Yang’s father is a master refiner. At the same time, he is also a top expert.”

“Refining weapons usually requires an extremely high cultivation level. Therefore, a master refiner is a top expert.”

Qin Yu nodded slightly, but he didn’t really care.

In any case, he already had enough enemies. He didn’t need to worry about one or two more.

He wasn’t afraid of being bitten by more lice.

After walking around, Qin Yu didn’t find any treasures that he wanted.

Therefore, the three of them left the place.

After returning to the Martial Arts Academy, Qin Yu took out the gourd.

“What is so mysterious about this gourd?” Qin Yu looked at the man with the mustache.

The man with the mustache took the gourd and said in a low voice, “I don’t know either.”

Then, he took out a bunch of talismans and stuck them on the gourd.

Then, the man with the mustache pressed his palms together and muttered to himself, as if he was casting some kind of spell.

After a few minutes, the gourd began to transform.

The cracked skin on it shattered!

A ray of purple light shot into the sky!
