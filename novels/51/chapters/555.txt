Chapter 556: Breaking Through to the Martial Marquis Realm Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Zhen Yue had this thought in her mind, but she wasn’t in a hurry to make a decision.

The whole night, Zhen Yue lay in bed without sleeping and kept thinking about this question. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Finally, in the early morning, Zhen Yue sat up from her bed.

“Mr. Qin is the Vice Sect Master of the Green Moon Villa. If I gave Iceheart Lake to him, Iceheart Lake would stay with Beaufort Tower in another way.” Zhen Yue took a deep breath.

This might be the best choice for her.

Therefore, Zhen Yue stood up and walked towards Qin Yu’s room.

When she reached the door, she heard the sound of pills being refined coming from inside.

This also strengthened Zhen Yue’s determination!

“Mr. Qin has done his best for the Green Moon Villa. Maybe Iceheart Lake should really be handed over to him.”

At the thought of this, Zhen Yue pushed the door open and entered.

Seeing Zhen Yue walking in, Qin Yu slowly stood up and said with a smile, “Sect Master Zhen, why are you here?”

Zhen Yue gritted her teeth and said in a low voice, “Mr. Qin, if I give Iceheart Lake to you, you can step into the Martial Marquis Realm, right?”

“Iceheart Lake?” Qin Yu was stunned.

Zhen Yue nodded and said, “Right under that gap.”

Qin Yu said in a low voice, “I’m 90% sure.”

“Okay!” Zhen Yue made up her mind.

“Then come with me. I’ll take you there now and open that gap.”

After saying that, Zhen Yue turned around and walked out.

Qin Yu was extremely excited and kept shouting in his heart, “Finally, I tricked her into giving it to me!” Qin Yu almost jumped up!

Although that was the case, if Qin Yu didn’t take it, it would belong to the Saint Confucian Sect sooner or later.

At least Qin Yu could restore the Green Moon Villa to its former glory.

Suppressing the excitement in his heart, Qin Yu followed Zhen Yue to the Iceheart Lake.

Standing by the lake, Zhen Yue bit her lips.

She looked up at Qin Yu and said, “You will definitely help the Green Moon Villa develop, right?”

Qin Yu said in a deep voice, “My first goal is to replace the Saint Confucian Sect.”

“Okay!” Zhen Yue nodded.

Then, she took the lead and stepped into Iceheart Lake.

Qin Yu didn’t waste any time and followed closely behind.

The two went deep into Iceheart Lake and soon arrived at the gap.

Zhen Yue put her palms together and murmured to herself.

The gap started to glow.

Then, the gap grew bigger and bigger until it was as big as a disk!

Streams of icy-blue light were revealed from the gap.

Zhen Yue pointed at the gap and said, “Iceheart Lake is here.”

Qin Yu stared at the gap.

There was a rock that looked like an ice block in the gap.

The rock was shining with a pale-blue light that looked beautiful underwater.

Then, a stream of rich spiritual energy gushed out.

In an instant, the spiritual energy in the entire Iceheart Lake surged!

Qin Yu reached out his slightly trembling hand and took the Iceheart out of the gap.

“Is this the Iceheart? It’s been passed down for ten thousand years...” Qin Yu’s eyes sparkled, and he couldn’t calm down for a long time.

“Mr. Qin, let’s go up,” Zhen Yue said in a low voice.

After saying that, she took the lead and swam up.

Qin Yu put the Iceheart into the spatial artifact for the time being and then came to the shore.

“Sect Master Zhen, thank you very much.” Qin Yu bowed to Zhen Yue sincerely.

Zhen Yue sighed and said in a low voice, “I’ve thought it through. The news of Iceheart has already spread out. Keeping it would be a disaster.”

At this point, Zhen Yue looked at Qin Yu and said, “How will others cultivate after you take Iceheart Lake away?”

Qin Yu smiled and said, “Don’t worry. After I kill Gu Canghai, I’ll occupy the Saint Confucian Sect.”

“By then, the Saint Confucian Sect will be the new sect of Green Moon Villa.”

Zhen Yue could only nod her head when she saw this.

“I don’t have much time, so I won’t chat with you,” Qin Yu said.

Gu Canghai said that he would only give him three days.

Qin Yu had to devour this Iceheart within these three days!

As long as he reached the Martial Marquis Realm, Qin Yu didn’t have to fear Gu Canghai anymore!

Qin Yu took the Iceheart and returned to his room.

“Sect Master Zhen, Don’t disturb me for the next few days,” Qin Yu said.

Zhen Yue nodded and said, “Okay, I understand.”

Qin Yu closed the door.

He took out the Iceheart and felt the spiritual energy from it.

Then, Qin Yu opened all the pores on his body and started to devour the Iceheart at an extremely fast speed!

Endless amounts of spiritual energy surged into Qin Yu’s body.

The speed was so fast that it made people speechless!

Even Qin Yu himself was a little surprised because the spiritual energy in the Iceheart was even denser and purer than Qin Yu had imagined!

There were almost no impurities in the Iceheart!

“I’ve never felt such pure spiritual energy before!” Qin Yu couldn’t help but gasp!

Even the five thousand year-old herbs and even the warehouse of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion couldn’t compare to it

“I understand!” Qin Yu suddenly guessed something!

This so-called Iceheart was actually a block of ice formed from pure spiritual energy!

It was said that when the spiritual energy was dense enough, it would turn from gas into dew.

And now, this spiritual energy had turned into a block of ice. The degree of its density was self-evident!

In the current society, it was extremely difficult to get resources from the Jingdu Martial Arts Association and the various aristocratic families.

An Iceheart with such dense spiritual energy was simply unimaginable!

“It’s a good thing that they one targeting it is the Saint Confucian Sect and not the Jingdu Martial Arts Association,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

Otherwise, Iceheart would have already changed owners. With their abilities, they would probably be able to retrieve Iceheart even without Zhen Yue.

Time passed by minute by minute. In the blink of an eye, a day had passed.

In this one day, Iceheart’s spiritual energy had not been depleted at all!

This also made Qin Yu a little anxious.

After all, time was short, and Qin Yu could not afford to wait.

After thinking about it, he simply broke off a small piece of the Iceheart and stuffed it into his mouth.

The moment this small piece of Iceheart entered his stomach, Qin Yu immediately felt an incomparably dense spiritual energy explode in his dantian! ” ...”

“Oh no!” Qin Yu exclaimed inwardly!

This Iceheart had only entered his stomach for less than a second, but it had already filled his entire dantian!

If this Iceheart was completely dissolved, wouldn’t it make his dantian explode?

Qin Yu hurriedly circulated his Meridian Circulation Technique to digest this spiritual energy.

However, the density of the spiritual energy was beyond imagination, and waves of intense pain still came from his lower abdomen!

The abudant spiritual energy flowed along Qin Yu’s dantian and began to surge upwards.

His chest and forehead were almost filled with this spiritual energy.

Qin Yu felt as if his head was about to explode, and his forehead was full of sweat.

He circulated his Meridian Circulation Technique with all his might and used up this spiritual energy.

Fortunately, this spiritual energy finally began to stabilize and slowly flow in his body.

...

Time flew by, and in the blink of an eye, it was already the third day.

In the Saint Confucian Sect, Gu Canghai’s expression was ice-cold, and there were several people standing in front of him.

These people were all the elites of the Saint Confucian Sect!
