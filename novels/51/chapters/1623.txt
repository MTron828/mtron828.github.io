“I really can’t understand why the sect leader has changed so much...”the deputy sect leader muttered softly as he lay on the bed.

Could it be that he was really afraid of the northern lands?

This was impossible. He had once witnessed the sect leader’s heroic bearing in the battle back then. That was an existence that had killed the fear of all the great sects!

If it weren’t for the Death River, the expansion of the Heavenly Cloud sect would never have stopped.

Why would they be afraid of the northern lands now?

“Perhaps, it’s because the sect master feels that it’s not worth fighting now.”

At this moment, Di Zun walked in from outside.

The deputy sect master looked at Di Zun and frowned. “What do you mean?”

Di Zun said in a deep voice, “I’m just guessing that the person the sect master is waiting for might be the master of the northern lands. Before he appears, I guess the sect master will not appear.”

After hearing this, the deputy sect leader immediately fell into deep thought.

He suddenly felt that the sect leader seemed to be an extremely heartless person.

His son had been beheaded, but he did not get angry. His own brother had died in the northern lands, but he still did not make a move.

To him, what was the most important thing was something that the deputy sect leader could not figure out.

“Deputy sect leader, I’m going to enter closed-door cultivation next,”Di Zun said to the deputy sect leader.

“Under such a huge battle, I also want to contribute.”

The vice sect leader remained silent, as if silently agreeing with Di Zun’s thoughts.

...

Great Yue Mountain.

Qin Yu was still refining beast spirit pills one after another.

In a month’s time, Qin Yu had refined thousands of beast spirit pills!

Such speed was enough to shock the entire holy region!

Looking at the Beast Spirit Pill in front of him, Qin Yu wiped the sweat off his forehead.

“These pills should be enough,”Qin Yu thought to himself.

Then, Qin Yu gathered all the sect leaders.

The southern region was huge, and there were countless top sects.

At a glance, there were at least a hundred sect leaders present!

Qin Yu pointed at the Beast Spirit Pill in front of him and said, “Each sect leader will receive fifty beast spirit pills. As for how to distribute them, it’s up to each sect leader to decide.”

All the sect leaders cupped their hands and thanked Qin Yu. Then, they received the Beast Spirit Pills According to the order.

“Qin Yu, thank you very much.”An elder sect leader grabbed Qin Yu’s hand, his eyes filled with gratitude.

Qin Yu said in a deep voice, “Although these beast spirit pills have been distributed to you, I also hope that each of your sect will be able to protect one side. Before long, the Great War will begin in full.”

“Qin Yu, don’t worry. From the moment senior Xiao Hai died, we will fight to the death with the northern lands!”A sect master shouted.

A stone stirred up a thousand layers of waves, and everyone followed suit and shouted loudly.

Seeing such a grand scene, Qin Yu couldn’t help but sigh in his heart.

If Xiao Hai saw such a scene, he would surely be gratified.

After the sect masters left, Qin Yu looked at Wen Wanye.

“Master, it’s time for us to set off for the purple-red volcano,”Qin Yu said.

Wen wanye frowned slightly and said, “Don’t you plan to rest for a few days?”

“No, time is tight. No one can afford to delay,”Qin Yu shook his head and said.

Wen wanye knew Qin Yu’s temper, so he didn’t continue to persuade him.

“Then let’s set off now,”Wen Wanyi said.

Qin Yu grunted and summoned the Divine Eagle. The two of them rode the Divine Eagle and rushed toward the purple-red volcano.

The purple-red volcano.

It was extremely hot here. Everything in the surroundings turned into powder and gravel under the temperature.

However, under such an environment, there was a small city nearby.

The city was a few hundred stars away from the purple-red volcano, which was considered a safe distance from the purple-red volcano.

The high temperature made the people in the city sweat profusely, and their skin was dark.

At a glance, it was a different kind of scenery.

“That’s the famous Divine Artifact City,”Wen Wanji pointed at the city and said.

Qin Yu looked at Wen Wanji and said, “Divine Artifact City? What does that mean?”

Wen Wanji stroked his beard and said with a smile, “Divine artifact city is different from the outside world. The people born in this city will be trained in the art of refining artifacts from a young age. If they have talent, they will focus on cultivating it. If they don’t have talent, they will be driven out of divine artifact city.”

After saying that, Wen wanji continued, “Don’t look at how small this city is, but there are many top-notch masters of refining artifacts hidden in this divine artifact city.”

Qin Yu nodded slightly. It just so happened that he had the remnant magical artifact left behind by Ye Nan. When the time came, he could let this divine artifact city Polish it.

“If there’s a chance, I’ll have to pay a visit,”Qin Yu said.

Wen Wanji shook his head and said, “There’s no need for a chance. We need to go to the divine artifact city now.”

“Why?”Qin Yu asked, somewhat puzzled.

Wen Wanji pointed at the volcano that was emitting a purple radiance in the distance and said, “This purple-red volcano has a special characteristic. The flames of each period are greatly different. The flames are sometimes fierce, and sometimes gentle.”

“And the intense flames are used to melt divine weapons. Only with gentle flames can one forge a divine artifact.”

“We are unable to control the time of this volcano, so we can only seek advice from the locals.”

Hearing these words, Qin Yu could not help but turn pale with fright.

This purple-red volcano was simply born to refine artifacts!

The flames that were sometimes gentle and sometimes fierce were indeed very suitable for refining artifacts.

“I hope that the current flame is just right,”Wen Wanyun said.

With that, the two of them walked toward the Divine Artifact City.

As soon as they stepped into the Divine Artifact City, Qin Yu and Wen Wanyun felt a wave of heat coming toward them.

This wave of heat was like boiling water, and it was extremely uncomfortable on their faces.

“What a high temperature,”Qin Yu said with a frown.

Wen wanyun nodded and said, “This is already a safe distance from the purple-red volcano. If we take another step forward, I’m afraid that the entire city will be annihilated.”

Qin Yu couldn’t help but be secretly speechless. It seemed that this purple-red volcano was even more terrifying than he had imagined.

“Dang dang dang”sounds could be heard coming from the entire city, as if someone was refining equipment.

From time to time, one could also hear the older blacksmiths scolding the younger apprentices.

Although the city wasn’t big, it was extraordinarily lively.

The entrance of Qin Yu and Wen Wanyun didn’t attract too much attention. Everyone seemed to be busy with their own matters. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Wen Wenti brought Qin Yu to a refining workshop. Although this refining workshop was not big, it was filled with a dazzling array of materials.

At the entrance, there was a huge fire barrel. Inside the barrel, there was a purple flame dancing slightly.

A burly man with his upper body exposed was holding a hammer and hammering a red-hot instrument. The instrument seemed to be a sword.

Beside him stood a young girl who was helping him.

Although she lived in such an environment, her skin was abnormally fair, forming a sharp contrast with that burly man.

“Hello.”Qin Yu and Wen Wanyi walked in front of the burly man and shouted.

The burly man didn’t even raise his head and asked, “Do you want to refine weapons?”
