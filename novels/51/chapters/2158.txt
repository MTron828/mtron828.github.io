2159 A Close Call

Seeing such a tragic scene, Qin Yu could no longer bear it. He ran to Dean Lei like a madman and pleaded desperately, “Dean Lei, please stop. I beg you. Please stop!”

Dean Lei gritted his teeth. He would never be willing to stop at this moment!

“Dean Lei, too many innocent people have died because of this. Please stop. I beg you…” Qin Yu said in a trembling voice.

Seeing no response from Dean Lei, Qin Yu looked at Yan Tianshi and shouted, “Yan Tianshi, don’t you want to kill me? Come on! I’ll let you kill me!”

With a shout, Golden Light surged. Yan Tianshi slightly narrowed his eyes and snorted. “Why? Do people like you have a mind with compassion?”

“As long as you stop, I will let you do whatever you want.” Qin Yu’s voice became incomparably cold.

Of course, Yan Tianshi did not want to prolong the dispute. He would be an eternal sinner if the Holy Region was destroyed.

With this way out, he immediately raised his palm and muttered softly.

After a while, he finally retrieved the celestial artifact.

The world stopped shaking instantly, and the terrifying internal qi slowly dissipated.

After Yan Tianshi put away his celestial artifact, the celestial artifact in Dean Lei’s hand seemed to have lost its sensing ability and slowly fell from the sky, returning to Dean Lei’s hand.

“Yan Tianshi, you look like not having the guts either!” Dean Lei grabbed the celestial artifact in his hand and shouted. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Yan Tianshi placed his hands behind his back and said indifferently, “I have achieved my goal, so why should I compete with you?”

Then he looked at Qin Yu and said, “Qin Yu, you still remember what you said just now, do you?”

Qin Yu’s gaze was dim and lifeless, and he could not help but look at the dead and injured crowd below, the pain in his eyes aggravated.

“What, are you fooling me?” Yan Tianshi’s voice immediately turned cold when he saw Qin Yu keeping quiet.

Dean Lei, standing at the side, hurriedly took over and shouted, “So what if he’s fooling you? Let’s continue if you are not convinced!”

“Do you think I’m afraid of you?” Yan Tianshi said coldly.

At this critical moment of tension and confrontation, Qin Yu’s gaze suddenly became even more determined.

He first cast an apologetic look in Yan Ruoxue’s direction before walking toward Yan Tianshi.

Soon, Qin Yu came to Yan Tianshi.

Their eyes met, and at this moment, Yan Tianshi saw the determination in Qin Yu’s eyes.

Even Yan Tianshi could not help but be stunned by his determination.

“To kill me or to torture me, it’s up to you!” Qin Yu said coldly.

“Oh?” Yan Tianshi slightly narrowed his eyes and said, “You’re willing to give up your life for those ants?”

Qin Yu said coldly, “You were born into a great aristocratic family when you were young. You have tens of millions of people at your beck and call and True Saint to accompany you in your cultivation. As long as you want it, you can easily get anything. You certainly don’t understand.

“For someone like you, it is very difficult to satisfy your desires. Even if you obtain a planet or a continent, it will only cause a slight ripple in your heart.”

Then Qin Yu pointed at the ordinary cultivators below Peach Blossom Island.

“But they’re not the same. They’re easy to satisfy. It could just be to reunite with their families, or perhaps it is to accompany their children to grow up. This is their happiness, their only happiness,” Qin Yu said coldly.

“But now, because of the battle between people like you, you’re depriving them of their only happiness. Don’t you think it’s very cruel?”

Yan Tianshi looked at Qin Yu in a daze. He did not expect Qin Yu to say such words.

“Don’t listen to his nonsense. Since he wants to die, satisfy him!” a True Saint hurriedly stood up and shouted.

Yan Tianshi came to his senses. He looked at Qin Yu coldly and said, “Are you really not afraid of death?”

“I’m afraid, but I’ve already implicated too many innocent people. Let’s end it here.” Qin Yu slightly closed his eyes as if he was waiting for his judgment.

At this moment, Dean Lei hurriedly walked over. He glared at Yan Tianshi and said, “Yan Tianshi, I will never allow you to attack Qin Yu!”

“This is his own choice, so what does it have to do with you?” Yan Tianshi narrowed his eyes and said.

Dean Lei gritted his teeth and shouted, “He was just confused for a moment, and he said doesn’t count!”

Yan Tianshi sneered and said, “Dean Lei, you should respect his choice. More people will die if we continue to fight, and by that time, Qin Yu will also die. Do you understand?”

Dean Lei’s brows furrowed even more tightly and seemed unable to find a good solution.

He could not help but look at the void as if he was waiting for something.

However, the void was completely silent, without any fluctuations at all.

“Qin Yu, in that case, I’ll satisfy you.” Yan Tianshi slowly raised his hand, and a terrifying internal qi began to gather in front of Qin Yu.

If this palm were to land, it would probably shatter Qin Yu’s head instantly and wipe out his divine sense altogether.

Seeing the palm about to land, Yan Ruoxue struggled to break free and appeared in front of Qin Yu almost in an instant!

She blocked Qin Yu behind her and glared at Yan Tianshi.

“Kill me first if you want to kill him!” Yan Ruoxue gritted her teeth, her eyes almost bleeding.

Yan Tianshi frowned and said coldly, “Take her away!”

Two True Saints of the Yan family hurried over and pulled Yan Ruoxue to the side.

“If you kill him, I’ll not live on!” Yan Ruoxue roared like a madman and struggled desperately. However, under the control of the two True Saints, she could not break free at all!

Yan Tianshi ignored Yan Ruoxue. He slowly raised his palm, ready to smack Qin Yu’s head at any moment.

“Stop!”

Yan Ruoxue’s deafening roar at the top of her lungs filled the entire Peach Blossom Island. Her tears flowed incessantly like a broken string of beads, and her internal qi became tremendously weak.

Yan Tianshi’s palm was about to land on Qin Yu’s face. The scorching internal qi caused incredible pain in Qin Yu’s face.

Qin Yu looked pale, and despair filled his heart.

However, he did not regret his choice. He would still do the same if he had to do it again

“Ruoxue, I’ll make it up to you in my next life…” Qin Yu murmured as if he had given up everything.

However, just as Yan Tianshi’s palm was about to land on Qin Yu’s face, he suddenly stopped what he was doing. The light on his palm also slowly disappeared.

“Hmm?”

Everyone was stunned and seemed not to understand Yan Tianshi’s actions.

Yan Tianshi looked at Qin Yu coldly. It was unknown if it was due to his conscience or worry for Yan Ruoxue.

He looked at Qin Yu and said coldly, “I can spare your life, but I must expel you from the Holy Region. You will return to where you came from.”
