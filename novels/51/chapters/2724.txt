Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

This was out of Qin Yu’s expectations. He had spent a lot of time trying to figure out a way to increase the power of dreams, but he still could not find it.

His strength improved when he went deep into his memories this time.

Could it be that the cultivation of the Dao of Dreams required one to enter the dream world to derive more powerful power continuously?

Qin Yu pondered. However, this thing was like walking on a steel wire.

He would ended up miserably if he were not careful. If Meng Jing hadn’t noticed something was wrong, he would have been lost in the dream forever. After this life-and-death situation, only a few traces of Night Qi were born.

“Qin Yu, thank you.”

After an unknown period, Meng Jing suddenly raised her head.

Qin Yu raised his head and saw a pretty face that had restrained all her emotions.

Meng Jing stood up slowly and walked to Qin Yu.

At this moment, her body was emitting a suffocating internal qi. The space in front of her suddenly turned upside down.

Meng Jing’s finger emitted a ray of light and then she suddenly tapped on Qin

Yu’s head.

God’s Space!

Qin Yu’s head was buzzing. This move was launched when Meng Jing confronted the Starry Sandworm. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

With his strength, he could not stop Meng Jing at all.

“Use your Night Qi to dissolve the power of my move. If you can’t do it, then die.”

An indifferent voice suddenly sounded in Qin Yu’s sea of consciousness.

Then, a force completely exploded in Qin Yu’s body. Only after personally facing this attack did Qin Yu understand how powerful this move was.

This was a four-dimensional attack!

All living beings lived in a three-dimensional space, but this attack had the power of time added.

Therefore, the strange state that appeared before would appear. It would gather all the past, present, and future attacks. The most ordinary spell would be used to unleash a powerful attack.

This was Meng Jing’s ultimate power, the God’s Space.

The power of this move was even above the power of the eight trigrams.

Qin Yu did not hesitate at all.

When the little light exploded, he had fully controlled the Night Qi in his body and sealed this four-dimensional tactic.

His body trembled slightly.

If the Night Qi could not suppress this attack, he might be completely shattered by the power of this force.

However, what surprised him happened. The Night Qi on his body wrapped around this power.

The violent power of the four-dimensional attack in God’s Space calmed down. It seemed to have become an obedient dog under the cover of the Night Qi, lying dormant in Qin Yu’s body.

Qin Yu’s tense body took a long time to calm down. His eyes were filled with shock.

This situation showed that the power attribute of the Night Qi he cultivated was even above that of God’s Space.

If that was the case, he could also use Night Qi to seal the power of the eight trigrams in his body.

Although Qin Yu could not think of how to use this power for the time being, Meng Jing had an idea.

Qin Yu only realized that Meng Jing had returned to the small house after he had resolved this matter.

She was hugging a cute little doll in each hand and had already fallen asleep on the bed. Her long eyelashes were still moving slightly as if she was having a sweet dream.

“Goodbye, Meng Jing. It’s time for me to do my thing. If I can help you one day, I will do my best.”

Qin Yu touched the Seal of Heaven Returning on his chest. This was what he owed Saint Chen Shuang.

His body slowly floated and silver holy energy slowly emanated from his body.

Ling Bo!

In the next moment, a booming sound reverberated in the air.

Qin Yu’s body had turned into a stream of light that was difficult to capture. He quickly left into the distance.

His Milky Way Holy Body was now three times stronger than before.

When Ling Bols speed exploded, even catching his shadow was difficult.

Not long after, he appeared in a city. This was the place with the densest population.

Qin Yu had to figure out where he was before he could make the next step of his plan.

During the battle at the Demon Sealing Valley, they had lost contact with the peak master.

He also couldn’t find Ruoxue, Lei Xin, Chang Mang, Jue Wu, and the others.

Now, he had to cultivate while searching for traces of them.

When he first stepped into this place, he kept being pushed forward.

He was like a marionette along the way to the Demon Sealing Valley, always in a situation of fleeing for his life.

After reaching the core area, he had the chance to find them now.

Qin Yu walked to the city gate. At this moment, the towering city was emitting a cold and gloomy internal qi.

Above the city gate, expressionless soldiers were patrolling. “If you want to enter the city, you have to pay ten Saint Stones.”

The patrolling soldier stared at Qin Yu indifferently.

Qin Yu frowned slightly.

The other places did not need even an ore. He glanced at the soldiers in front of him. A hint of killing intent flashed in his eyes.

Forget it. There would be a lot of people near such a large city. It should be easy to get some Saint Stones.

“Brother, are you short of money? It’s hard to move without money these days. But if you’re strong, it’s not impossible to kill your way in.”

A tall and thin man smiled as he leaned over.

“What is it?”

Qin Yu said indifferently.

“I happen to have a job here. Come with me to do something. After the matter is done, I’ll pay the entrance fee for you. You barely fit this job with your strength. This is a rare bargain.”

Qin Yu frowned and was about to refuse. However, he suddenly thought of something and spoke again.

“That’s fine. However, I just came here. I have to ask you something. You have to tell me honestly.”

“Hahaha! No problem. You’re lucky, outsider. I’m Ju Feng. I have lived here for nearly a thousand years. I know everything about this place.” The thin man laughed loudly and his eyes narrowed into a thin line.

Ju Feng (giant peak)? You’re probably a fine dog.

Qin Yu glanced at Ju Feng’s skinny body.

“Where is this place? Is it far from the Endless Mine?”

“Nearly 200,000 kilometers. If you have a high-speed flying magical artifact, it’s not considered far.”

Ju Feng thought for a moment and said.

Qin Yu nodded. He had walked a short distance in the passageway before coming out. This fellow should not have lied to him.

“Is there a place to gather intelligence in this city? I need to know some information.”

“Hahahaha! This is the most chaotic city in the core region. Countless gold diggers gamble their lives here. There are people from all directions. Of course, there will be countless intelligence gathered here. There is even information about the Divine Realm. However, do you have money?”

Ju Feng laughed..
