But in the end, he still let Hua Tian enter as well. His gaze stopped on the last woman.

This woman’s facial features were like the masterpiece of a master sculptor, upright and perfect. Her elegant nose bridge, long eyebrows, and deep eyes seemed to be able to see through people’s hearts.

MO Wendao stared at her doubtfully. It seemed that there was no such person among the outstanding younger generation in the Demon Sealing Valley. He had no impression of her at all.

Furthermore, he sensed that this person’s internal qi was not an outsider.

She suddenly took out a jade token. When MO Wen examined it carefully, the expression on his face changed drastically.

“Are you from the Saint Kingdom?”

Seeing that the woman had already walked in, he gasped.

It had been many years since anyone had come out of the core region of the Saint Kingdom. Did they also sense the change this time?

The moment Qin Yu stepped onto the fifth level, he discovered that the atmosphere was completely different from the four levels below.

The many magical artifacts here were stained with dim blood, which was different from the weapons at the lower levels.

It seemed that these weapons were obtained from the battlefield. There was a bone-chilling feeling here.

“Yin-Yang Transformation Formation?”

Qin Yu frowned. There were actually Yin-Yang Transformation Formations carved on the four walls here.

All of the Yang qi was converted into Yin qi, which was why Qin Yu had such a

cold feeling in his divine soul.

He had learned some formations from Wang Feng before. His father had also left him a lot of relevant information, so he could roughly determine it. “Be careful. These weapons are not weak…”

In Qin Yu’s sea of consciousness, Immortal Emperor Yao’s voice slowly sounded.

Qin Yu frowned. To be able to make Immortal Emperor Yao reminded him, it didn’t seem simple.

He cast his gaze on a hideous mask in front of him. The moment his gaze landed on the mask, he was blocked by a level of hazy power.

“Hmph! How dare a mask stop me?”

Qin Yu sneered.

The power of the Nine Heavens Manifestations Gaze enveloped that area and saw through all the details of the mask.

“It’s a mask made from the head of a Ghost King. Moreover, it seems to be a very powerful Ghost King. Wearing this mask can even command the surrounding dark souls to come and help.”

When Qin Yu saw the mask in front of him clearly, he was also shocked.

Qin Yu’s actions seemed to have angered the Ghost King Mask.

The mask let out a mournful whimper. The entire fifth level was filled with a cold wind.

The mask suddenly covered Qin Yu’s face, and a viscous liquid dripped from the sharp edges of the mask bones.

The edge of the mask suddenly became soft as it seeped into Qin Yu’s skin.

It stuck tightly to Qin Yu’s face and began to squirm as if it wanted to fuse with Qin Yu’s face.

A terrifying consciousness from the mask invaded his sea of consciousness. A huge Ghost King suddenly took shape in Qin Yu’s sea of consciousness.

The ghost claws that filled the sky were trying to grab Qin Yu’s origin into his mouth.

“I’m not afraid even if you’re in the heyday. How dare you steal my consciousness as a mask made of broken pieces?”

Qin Yu sneered. A divine flame appeared at the tip of his finger.

Then, it bounced onto the Ghost King Mask on his face. In an instant, a ball of flames exploded on the mask.

Even the Ghost King in his consciousness was completely ignited and turned into ashes.

Holy Light Divine Flame.

This was a just trace of the Holy Light Divine Flame that Qin Yu had previously snatched from Gu Tian.

However, the holy flames were extremely effective against these evils. The Ghost King artifact spirit was instantly turned to ashes by the flames.

Qin Yu once again sent his divine sense into the Ghost King Mask since it was not broken.

However, the energy fluctuations of the mask were much smaller than before because the artifact spirit within the mask had been burned to ashes by the holy light flames. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“It’s a pity that I can’t remove this artifact spirit. Otherwise, the power of this magical artifact will be greatly weakened. ”

Qin Yu shook his head. He once again came to a spear that was suffused with silver light.

The body of the spear was not straight. Instead, there were some winding waves.

When Qin Yu approached, he suddenly felt a ferocious dragon roar coming from his sea of consciousness.

This spear was made of dragon bones. The tip of the spear seemed to be made of the hardest dragon scales, which was why it produced a dragon roar warning sound.

Qin Yu scrutinized the spear, and then his consciousness penetrated it without hesitation.

Dragon’s Roar Spear! This was the name of the spear.

In Qin Yu’s sea of consciousness, a person was holding a spear.

In the vast desert, a cold light suddenly appeared.

The cold light instantly pierced through Qin Yu’s sea of consciousness.

The spear didn’t stop. More snowflake-like cold lights appeared again.

The owner of the spear rode his horse behind the spear. His body did not seem to move at all.

He had already stabbed out countless times. The speed of the spear was so fast that it seemed to have no movement.

The rain in May was small but dense.

Qin Yu’s sea of consciousness was instantly filled with countless spear radiances.

Each strand of spear radiance was condensed with a terrifying spear intent that was as unstoppable as a hot knife through butter.

A terrifying divine might almost instantly froze his soul power.

Qin Yu was greatly shocked. He did not expect that a long spear could emit such terrifying spear intent.

To be able to lock down his soul power, this spear intent was at least at the True Consciousness Realm. He didn’t expect it to be performed by the artifact spirit of a spear.

If he could obtain this spear, it would mean that he could directly obtain this spear intent.

Qin Yu’s eyes suddenly turned pitch-black. The Dusk Saber in his sea of consciousness flickered.

After this slash, he would not be overly affected by the power of destruction. He could rely on his soul power to resist.

After the blade light flashed, everything returned to silence.

The spear drops like the rain in May shattered one after another. Even the spear was sent flying. It let out a loud cry as it stabbed into the ground.

“What a powerful strength! How I wish to use my peak strength to fight against your saber! What a pity…”

The remnant spirit on the white horse let out a sigh.

As the figure slowly dissipated, the terrifying pressure gradually disappeared.

Qin Yu sat cross-legged on the ground. After suppressing the terrifying destructive intent, then only he slowly stood up.

Even though he had used the Dusk Saber which he could endure, the backlash was still shocking. That shocking destructive consciousness was constantly trying to assimilate him and make him a puppet of the Order of Saint

Kingdom..
