Chapter 1191: Chapter 1,191, news of his mother 

Finally, there was news from the Holy Region, which he had been waiting for a long time.

Qin Yu was also somewhat looking forward to it. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

In the next three days, he planned to search for he teng and Tian Xuehong.

However, the world was so big that it was not that easy to find the two of them.

After spending an entire day, Qin Yu had almost no results and had no choice but to give up.

“If he teng and Tian Xuehong don’t die, God knows what they will do if they stay on Earth.”Qin Yu frowned.

Chu Hedao, who was sitting beside Qin Yu, also nodded slightly and said, “If we leave, they will definitely cause trouble for one side.”

“This might be their plan.”Qin Yu took a deep breath.

When the martial saints left Earth together, no one would be a match for he teng and Tian Xuehong.

However, they were unwilling to stay.

They had waited for so long just to head to the holy region. Moreover, even if they stayed, they did not know if they would be able to find them.

Qin Yu was silent, and so was Chu Huidao.

Clearly, neither of them wanted to stay.

Although Qin Yu had this thought in his heart, he could not wait any longer. He could not wait to see Yan Ruoxue.

The next day.

Qin Yu found Yu Qin and told her that he planned to bring her to the holy region.

This was naturally a happy thing for Qin Yu. As long as she could follow Qin Yu, she could give up almost everything.

Soon, there was only one day left before the opening of the Holy Region.

On this day.

Qin Yu told her about the Heaven Gate. After confirming that there was no mistake, he slightly put down his thoughts and made preparations to go to the holy region.

All those who intended to head to the holy region had already gathered at the Heaven Gate, waiting for the opening of the Holy Region.

That night, Qin Yu lay on the bed, tossing and turning, unable to fall asleep.

After an unknown amount of time, Qin Yu lay on the bed and finally fell into a deep sleep.

“Qin Yu, your mother is still suffering in the world, but you ran to the Holy Region. Are you still human...”

In his sleep, a black shadow appeared in front of Qin Yu, and the Black Shadow kept repeating this sentence.

“Who are you! Why did you say that my mother is suffering!”Qin Yu raised his head and shouted!

“Qin Yu, your mother is still suffering in this world, but you went to the Holy Region. You are not human, you are an animal!”

The sentence kept repeating, stimulating Qin Yu’s brain again and again.

However, no matter how much Qin Yu roared, he still could not get an answer.

In the middle of the night, Qin Yu suddenly sat up from the bed. His face was full of sweat, and his face was full of panic.

“A nightmare, huh...”Qin Yu whispered.

He wiped the sweat on his forehead and gradually calmed down.

“Mother... What a strange word,”qin yu whispered.

Ever since he was born, he had never seen his parents, especially his mother. Qin Yu had no impression of her at all.

But blood was thicker than water, not to mention that Qin Yu was a person who valued friendship very much.

He lay on the bed and gradually calmed down.

Just as Qin Yu lay down and was about to sleep, an inkstone suddenly appeared beside his bed.

The stone was pitch black, almost blending into the night.

Qin Yu’s expression immediately changed, and he felt a chill down his back!

He grabbed the Inkstone and cried out in alarm, “Who! Who’s Here!”

But other than Echo, no one responded to him.

There were even disciples who came when they heard the news and asked, “Sect master, what happened?”

Qin Yu wiped his sweat and shook his head. “Nothing. Did you... see anyone who was up to no good?”

The two disciples looked at each other and shook their heads. “Sect master, the two of us didn’t see anyone during our patrol tonight.”

This immediately made Qin Yu feel even more terrified!

He silently came to his side. This level of cultivation was unfathomable!

“Could it be... that it wasn’t a dream just now? But someone had invaded my divine sense?”Qin Yu murmured in surprise.

“Sect master, Are You Alright?”The two disciples asked tentatively.

Qin Yu waved his hand and said, “I’m fine. You guys go ahead.”

“Then you should rest early.”After the two of them left these words, they turned around and walked out.

He grabbed the inkstone, his face gloomy and uncertain.

And that sentence in his sleep kept lingering in his mind.

“Could it be... that sentence in my sleep is true?”Qin Yu frowned tightly, feeling extremely uneasy.

At this moment, the Inkstone suddenly flashed with light, and Qin Yu’s divine sense was directly sucked into it.

Countless chaotic scenes flashed in his mind instantly.

These scenes were like a passing lantern, continuously playing in his mind, chaotic and disorderly, screaming incessantly.

In the scene, there was a young and beautiful woman who was constantly tortured, and amidst this torturous torture, she actually gave birth to a baby.

The baby was quickly carried away by someone, disappearing without a trace.

The woman’s face was filled with anger and pain, and tears of despair covered her face.

Even though Qin Yu had never seen this woman before, he felt a strange sense of familiarity and familiarity.

“Could it be... that she is my mother? The boy she gave birth to is me?”Qin Yu’s body trembled, and his pupils constricted.

The woman begged bitterly, but no one paid any attention to her.

In the next second, the woman’s body bled profusely. The Sweat and tears on her face interweaved together, making her look incomparably pitiful.

Then, her weaker body was thrown into a dungeon.

The scene in front of her turned pitch-black. Qin Yu’s divine sense also left the inkstone.

After his divine sense returned to his body, Qin Yu’s face was covered in sweat, and his heart was beating violently.

“That person... is that my mother... ?”Qin Yu muttered in a trembling voice.

What had she experienced, and where was she now?

As a dao protector, why did her father not save her?

Qin Yu was no longer sleepy. He got out of bed and rushed to the pavilion master’s room.
