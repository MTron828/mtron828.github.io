Chapter 2741: The Fourth Mark

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

“Almost all the top-notch martial artists have gathered this time. There are powerful Formation Masters, cultivators outside the Saint Kingdom, and even some unknown experts. But how many of them will survive in the end?” Wang Da shook his head.

Qin Yu was a little silent when he heard that. The greater the risk, the higher the benefits.

With so many people rushing towards the Tomb of Heavenly Sins like moths to a flame, this also indirectly proved that there must be an indescribable opportunity.

If what Wang Da said was true, at least three great Holy Consciousness top-notch martial artists in this Saint Kingdom were the examples.

It was said that even Dao Xuan could not do anything to the three great top-notch martial artists.

“Wang Da, do you know how to enter the Tomb of Heavenly Sins?”

“Rumor has it that there are a few ways. The first is to have the second mark on your body, and the second is to force your way in. The first method will greatly reduce the danger. If you are lucky, you can even obtain some inheritance. The second method is almost certain death, but even so, many people who do not have a mark still choose this method.”

Wang Da had mostly heard about these things from the others. He could not describe some details at all.

Wang Da only stopped when he reached a relatively remote place in Lingxu City.

‘ Little brother, I’m not trying to dampen your spirits, but there’s a high chance that you won’t be able to see the old man today. What message do you want me to send?”

“Tell him that I have the mark of the fourth form.”

“Alright.”

Wang Da was a little stunned. He seemed to be in disbelief. Not long after, he rushed out.

“Brother Qin Yu, the old man wants you to go in. Let me remind you that the people inside are not to be trifled with, especially that woman with long golden hair. You must be careful. If possible, don’t look directly into her eyes.”

Wang Da reminded him.

“Alright, thank you.”

Although he didn’t know why, Wang Da probably had good intentions.

Qin Yu thanked him and walked inside.

Qin Yu walked into the Great Hall. Many people in the hall immediately looked at him.

There was some doubt in everyone’s eyes, but more disdain as if they felt that his words were fake.

Sitting in the middle was a woman with a frosty expression. She lowered her head slightly and stroked the broadsword in her hand.

Compared to her petite body, this broadsword seemed to be a little out of place. Her long golden hair slid down from her shoulders. She seemed to have noticed

Qin Yu who had just entered.

This should be the woman Wang Da was talking about.

Qin Yu’s Nine Heavens Manifestations Gaze landed above but he could not detect the woman’s energy.

This was the Nine Heavens Manifestations Gaze’s first time in this kind of situation.

The woman seemed to have sensed Qin Yu’s investigation. She raised her head slightly and glanced at Qin Yu indifferently.

“Dao Realm level 9?”

She frowned slightly and continued to wipe the broadsword, ignoring Qin Yu.

“Show me your mark. If you lie, you will regret it.”

A young man was squatting on cne grouna. He 100Kea 11Ke a nanasome scnmar.

However, his words were freezing.

“Why don’t you show me?”

Qin Yu said with a smile. He could only display his strength to win equal respect in this place.

“As you wish.”

A voice came from behind Qin Yu. A black dagger was already stuck to Qin Yu’s throat.

This man’s spatial teleportation method was already unfathomable.

“Shhh! General!”

The man exhaled softly in Qin Yu’s ear, but he saw Qin Yu directly grab his wrist with a backhand.

The young man revealed a strange smile. Almost at the same time, a large amount of blood had already shot out from Qin Yu’s neck.

“You seem to be testing my speed.”

Before the young man could finish his words, he suddenly stopped.

At this moment, Qin Yu did not show any signs of letting go. He placed his other hand on the back of the young manrs head.

Silver holy energy suddenly burst out. In the next moment, Qin Yu threw the young man to the ground.

The entire Great Hall instantly turned into countless broken stones.

The young man was hundreds of meters deep into the ground.

“Oh, interesting! It seems to be a technique of the Dao of Dreams. In that case, what this kid said might be true.”

The old man saw through the mystery at a glance.

The fatal wound caused by the dagger disappeared in an instant.

“You’re courting death!”

The young man was in a sorry state. A terrifying aura instantly erupted from him.

His eyes were red, like a furious Fierce Beast.

“Enough, God Slayer Luo Yu.” The old man coughed lightly.

“Shut up.”

As Luo Yu’s voice fell, his figure had separated from Qin Yu.

A fatal wound appeared on Qin Yu’s waist.

Under this attack, half of his body was almost cut off.

Qin Yu frowned slightly. What a fast speed! Even the Nine Heavens Manifestatios Gaze were unable to capture this power.

“I’ll say it again. If you still attack, you’ll be eliminated.” The old man narrowed his eyes and said.

“Hmph! I hope you can maintain this power of yours.”

Luo Yu said softly. He seemed to understand the mysterious power on Qin Yu’s body, which could transfer damage.

The current him could not kill Qin Yu temporarily. “I hope your body can be as tough as your mouth.”

Qin Yu also sneered.

Luo Yu nodded and revealed a cold smile.

However, it seemed that the old man’s words also made him afraid. He did not dare to continue attacking Qin Yu.

“Qin Yu, can you let me take a look at your mark? This matter is extremely important to us.”

The old man was not as sloppy as he was the first time. He even looked a little nervous.

“I want all the information about the Tomb of Heavenly Sins. Let me understand it first, then I’ll show you this mark.”

Qin Yu shook his head. When dealing with these people, one must suppress their trump cards. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“No problem. If what you said is true, you are also qualified to become one of us. The information is open to you.”

The old man agreed straightforwardly.

“What forms of mark are there on your bodies? What’s the use of these marks?”

“As long as you pass the first trial of the Heavenly Sin, you will have the second mark of the Blood Atonement. At this time, Heavenly Sin will determine whether you are a sinner or not. If you are, it will continue to attack you. If you’re not, it will leave after you pass the test.”

Qin Yu frowned slightly. According to the old man, he was a sinner.

No wonder Heavenly Sin refused to let him go back then. If Sir Dagger hadn’t intervened at the last moment, his body would probably be stinky now.

“After passing the second test, the mark became the Devil’s Mark. This is also the third mark. Only Lord Alester has this mark. None of us have seen the fourth mark. Even the last time the Tomb of Heavenly Sins appeared, there was no one with the fourth mark..”
