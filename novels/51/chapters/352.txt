Chapter 353: Crush the North Province Island! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Mr. Zeng frowned slightly, as if he was afraid.

“Hurry up, what are you waiting for? Do you have to tell my uncle about something so trifling?” Li Wenqiang said impatiently.

Hearing this, Mr. Zeng didn’t say anything more.

After all, this was the North Province Island. On the North Province Island, Feng Chong was the overlord!

Therefore, Mr. Zeng didn’t think too much about it. Even if something really happened, Li Wenqiang would be there to support him. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Therefore, Mr. Zeng waved his hand and berated, “Take them away!”

A few people immediately walked forward.

At this time, Qin Yu quickly moved forward and stood in front of Old Mister Yan.

A powerful internal qi burst out from his body. He looked at the crowd coldly and said, “I dare you guys to take a step forward.”

“Inner Strength Past Master?” Mr. Zeng raised his eyebrows when he sensed Qin Yu’s internal qi.

A mere Inner Strength Past Master wasn’t even worth mentioning!

This made Mr. Zeng let out a sigh of relief. If Old Mister Yan was an important figure that he couldn’t afford to offend, then the bodyguard beside him couldn’t be just an Inner Strength Past Master.

“Swoosh!”

The rest of the people also released their internal qi at the same time!

Inner Strength Grandmasters!

Five Inner Strength Grandmasters!

“How dare you, an Inner Strength Past Master, be so impudent?” Mr. Zeng sneered.

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and said, “Then you can try.”

As he spoke, Qin Yu’s body flickered with a dark golden light.

Just as he was about to make a move, Old Mister Yan waved his hand to indicate to Qin Yu not to act rashly.

He walked to Mr. Zeng with his hands behind his back and said indifferently, “Young man, are you sure you don’t want to bring Feng Chong here?”

“Who do you think you are? You want to see my uncle?” Li Wenqiang scolded angrily.

“Haha, fine.” Old Mister Yan couldn’t help but stroke his beard and laugh.

“I’ll go with you. I want to see what you can do to us,” Old Mister Yan said indifferently.

Mr. Zeng snorted and said, “Then go ahead!”

Although Qin Yu was extremely displeased, he still followed Old Mister Yan’s instructions and got into the car.

The car drove away and soon arrived at a small warehouse on the shore of North Province Island.

“Lock them up first! Crush their spirit!” Li Wenqiang snorted.

Mr. Zeng nodded and waved his hand. “Bring them in! Confiscate their phones!”

“Yes!”

They snatched the phones of Old Mister Yan and the others and pushed them into the warehouse.

The door of the warehouse was slowly closed.

Ropes were tied to their bodies.

With a loud bang, the door was closed.

The warehouse was plunged into darkness, and the surroundings were completely silent.

Apart from the occasional sound of waves, there was almost no sound.

Qin Yu hurriedly looked at Yan Ruoxue and said anxiously, “Ruoxue, are you okay?”

Yan Ruoxue smiled and said, “What can happen to me? They should be the ones worrying.”

Qin Yu said with some confusion, “Old Mister Yan, why didn’t you let me take action just now?”

“I don’t feel intimidated by those five Inner Strength Grandmasters at all.”

However, Old Mister Yan shook his head and said, “After all, this is their territory. Even if you can defeat five Inner Strength Grandmasters, then what about ten? It’s not worth getting injured for such a small matter.”

Qin Yu frowned and said, “Then what should we do now?”

“Just wait. Wait for someone to save us,” Old Mister Yan said indifferently.

“But... We don’t even have a cell phone. Who would know that we’re being imprisoned...” Qin Yu said with a bitter smile.

Yan Ruoxue said from the side, “Don’t worry. As long as we don’t go home in the evening, my father and the others will immediately check the surveillance cameras.”

Qin Yu didn’t say anything more.

He sighed slightly. He really didn’t expect to encounter such a thing.

Time passed minute by minute. Qin Yu sat there cross-legged and began to meditate.

The internal qi of the North Province Island was quite dense. Qin Yu didn’t want to waste time, so he took advantage of this period of time to absorb the surrounding qi.

Time flew by, and in the blink of an eye, the sky gradually darkened.

It was already time to eat. The four brothers also returned to the Yan family manor.

After entering, Yan Sihai couldn’t help but frown.

Usually, at this time, Old Mister Yan would sit at the dining table and waiting quietly.

But today, the entire Yan family manor appeared quite quiet.

“Where is my father?” Yan Sihai glanced at the nanny and asked.

The nanny hurriedly said, “This morning, the eldest daughter took the Old Master to the North Province Island.”

“North Province Island?” Yan Sihai frowned.

He looked at his watch and said, “It’s quite late. Why aren’t they back yet?”

Yan Yongxiu couldn’t help but say, “That’s not right. No matter where Father goes, he will definitely come back at this time.”

Yan Sihai nodded. He took out his phone and dialed Old Mister Yan’s number.

But when the call was picked up, it wasn’t Old Mister Yan’s voice, but an impatient voice.

“Who are you? Why is my father’s phone there?” Yan Sihai asked coldly.

Li Wenqiang sneered. “Yo, that old fart is your father?”

“Old fart?” Veins popped up on Yan Sihai’s forehead.

Li Wenqiang sneered. “Your father was brazen enough to have provoked me. Now, I plan to teach him a little lesson.”

“I’ll lock him up for three days first. After three days, come to the North Province Island and apologize to me.”

After saying that, Li Wenqiang hung up the phone.

Yan Sihai’s expression was cold and his fists were clenched tightly

“How interesting.” Yan Sihai was so angry that he laughed.

“A nobody from the North Province Island dares to lock up my father and even wants me to apologize to him. Haha, are these people crazy?!” Yan Sihai threw his phone on the ground fiercely and shouted!

“Bro, what’s wrong?” The other three brothers hurriedly walked forward and asked.

Yan Sihai didn’t answer. Instead, he roared, “Where’s Long Yi? Get your *ss over here!”

Just as he finished speaking, a middle-aged man walked out from the darkness.

He bowed and said, “Eldest Young Master.”

Yan Sihai raised his hand and slapped Long Yi’s face!

“How are you keeping an eye on my father? You don’t even know that he was kidnapped?” Yan Sihai said through gritted teeth.

Long Yi’s expression instantly turned extremely ugly!

He knelt on the ground with a plop and anxiously explained, “Eldest Young Master, the Master... He didn’t want me to follow him...”

“Useless thing.” Yan Sihai took a deep breath and forcefully suppressed the anger inside.

Yan Tianhong hurriedly said, “Father was kidnapped? Who is so bold?”

Yan Sihai glanced at him, but didn’t answer this question. Instead, he said coldly, “Call someone immediately to follow me to the North Province Island.”

“Today, I will crush the North Province Island!” Yan Sihai coldly said.
