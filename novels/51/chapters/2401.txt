Chapter 2402 The Miserable Prince

He had comprehended the Way of Thunder and Lightning these few days, and his understanding of the thunder and lightning escape technique had become even deeper.

Qin Yu took out a shoe from the Sumeru ring and threw it to Chang Mang.

With his current speed, the Gale Resistance Boot was of limited use to him. Moreover, Chang Mang needed this pair of shoes even more.

Chang Mang closed his eyes to refine the effects of the Gale Resistance Boot.

With Qin Yu’s terrifying speed, the three arrived at Peach Blossom Island in less than two hours.

“Who is it? This is the base of the nine great aristocratic families. Get out of here immediately.”

A green-robed cultivator shouted angrily.

The moment he spoke, an almost imperceptible sound reverberated, and hundreds of transparent poisonous needles that looked like hair suddenly pierced out from the back of his robe.

A vast number of poisoned needles enveloped the three of them. This green-robed cultivator had immediately attacked the moment they met.

Chang Mang suddenly clapped his hands, and a burst of energy erupted from his palms, dispersing the hundreds of poisonous needles.

“You do have some strength. If you retreat now, I can let bygones be bygones. If the island’s elders come out later, you can forget about leaving.”

The green-robed cultivator sneered as he quietly grabbed a messenger arrow with one hand.

As he spoke, he shot the messenger arrow into the air, letting out a sharp whistle.

“Hahaha! Three reckless individuals who don’t know your place. You dare to act wildly without even considering where you are!”

The green-robed cultivator was completely relieved when he heard someone arrive not far away.

“Whoosh!

Qin Yu thrust a sword directly into the area above his forehead, and with a swift twist, his entire head was sent flying.

“You’ve talked too much nonsense.”

“Qin Yu, you dare to come to Peach Blossom Island!”

A member of the Yao family shouted, his face revealing a terrified expression.

A Peak of True Saint cultivator from the Si family sneered and said. His name was Si Wankong. Qin Yu had some impression of this person. He was also a member of the younger generation of the Ji family.

He could be considered Si Liuhe’s direct disciple and possessed exceptional intelligence and talent.

He placed his hands on his forehead and formed a technique. The surrounding air seemed to become scorching hot instantly.

A fire talisman slowly floated out from his forehead. Wherever the fire talisman went, the space suddenly lit up. The terrifying high temperature even ignited the air.

“Go!”

The fire talisman suddenly accelerated and crashed into Qin Yu’s body.

When it approached Qi Yu’s body, Si Wankong revealed a hideous sneer. From his sleeves, another talisman flew out like a breeze.

It exploded behind the fire talisman.

The Whirlwind Incantation!

Amid the violent gale, the wind fanned the flames.

The flames exploded like a volcanic eruption and covered the sky and earth like the end of the world.

Qin Yu nodded secretly. The combination of the two techniques in this attack had almost reached the power of the Way of Heaven and Earth of Tribulation First Level.

Being able to unleash such an attack with the power of the True Saint, this guy truly lived up to his reputation.

However, Qin Yu, who had been to the center of the lava on the Fire Unicorn Continent, did not even need to use his protective chaotic qi.

With a whoosh sound, Chang Mang stepped on the Gale Resistance Boot and appeared above Si Wankong.

After that, a fist smashed down fiercely, and another talisman flew out from Si Wankong’s sleeve. It exploded and formed a giant shield, blocking Chang Mang’s fist in an instant.

“A reckless fellow!”

Si Wankong sneered and said.

“Haha, then I’ll show you how reckless I am!”

The punch that hit the shield again exerted a massive magical force, and the shield let out a roar, unable to take the hit.

Then it exploded. Without losing momentum, the fist straightaway knocked Si Wankong down, smashing him hundreds of meters into the ground.

“Qin Yu, this Si family has locked me up for almost a hundred years. How about you let me kill these geniuses to collect some interest?”

Using his body as a weapon, he smashed into the pit Si Wankong had smashed.

“You didn’t wait for my reply.”

He swept out his divine sense and began to search for the position of the Prince of Great Xia.

His expression suddenly changed. His body moved, and he rushed toward a hall on Peach Blossom Island.

Seeing the direction Qin Yu was heading, the expressions of the dozens of cultivators changed, and they tried to stop Qin Yu.

“Get lost!”

Jue Wu slapped out, and a massive qi energy straightaway sent those dozens of cultivators flying.

“Your Highness, your mission is completed. Now, let me send you off. Do you want these three mastiffs to devour you, or would you prefer the gold-devouring ants to crawl up your nostrils and eat your internal organs?”

In the room, a middle-aged man with a gloomy complexion and eyebrows furrowed together let out a shrill laughter similar to that of a woman.

The prince’s face was as white as white paper. He lay on the bed without saying a word. No one knew what he was thinking.

“Your Highness, are you still unwilling to disclose the treasures of the royal family of Great Xia? You’re about to die. I guarantee you can leave in peace if you tell me about it. You’ve experienced my method. I’ve served the previous emperor before and knew many secrets. Don’t even think about fooling me.”

He was Eunuch Chu, one of the eunuchs on the prince’s side. After the rebellion of the nine great aristocratic families, he came to probe the secrets of the Great Xia Royal Family.

A royal family had countless secrets, and every bit of it was worth probing.

“It seems that the prince won’t drink a toast but to be punished with a full glass. Once the gold-devouring ants enter your body, it won’t be so easy to remove them.”

Eunuch Chu opened the lid of a jade bottle, and a colossal ant fell onto the prince’s stomach.

The ant bit hard, and a bloody hole visible to the naked eye appeared on the skin.

The prince’s body twitched uncontrollably. He was staring at the roof of the hall expressionlessly as if he had become a living dead.

“D*mn it! I don’t believe that I can’t pry open your mouth!”

Eunuch Chu let out an angry scream.

However, his voice ceased abruptly. His vision suddenly turned pitch-black as if he had fallen into a boundless abyss.

His entire body had been smashed into meat paste by Qin Yu. Qin Yu looked at the prince on the bed.

He was naked, and as a prince at the Advanced-stage Reversion Void, his bed emitted a foul stench.

Half of his body was already rotten, and his internal qi was not even as strong as that of an ordinary person. It was hard to imagine what torture he had suffered.

“You’re here.”

His eyes moved as he looked at Qin Yu.

“Yes, I’m here. Don’t talk yet.” Qin Yu took out a Spirit Pill and put it into the prince’s mouth.

The prince shook his head. He pushed the pill away and slowly spoke.

“Help me with my one last favor.”

“It’s very easy to die, or perhaps the most difficult. I promise you that if you still want to die after ten days, I will agree. But now, take this pill.”

Qin Yu pried open the prince’s mouth and poured the Spirit Pill in.
