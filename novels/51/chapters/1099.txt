Chapter 1100: Chapter 1,100, Ancient Almighty 

When the old man heard this, he was momentarily stunned.

Ordinary people would avoid demonic beasts, but this Qin Yu actually wanted him to summon demonic beasts? And the more the better?

Zhuang Teng, who was at the side, also didn’t quite understand.

He walked forward and reminded, “Qin Yu, it wasn’t easy for us to get rid of these demonic beasts. If we were to do it again, I’m afraid we won’t be able to hold on.”

Qin Yu smiled faintly and said, “Of course not now.”

The old man beside him was confused when he heard this. However, he understood in his heart that his life was temporarily saved.

“When we reach the Cloud Dragon Island, I will set up a formation. At that time, it will not be so difficult to encircle and annihilate the demonic beasts,”Qin Yu said.

If they could obtain their inner core, this trip would be considered a great harvest. It would not be too difficult for them to step into the middle stage of the martial saint realm.

“Cloud Dragon Island? You guys are going to the Cloud Dragon Island?”A trace of fear flashed across the old man’s face when he heard these words.

“Why, do you know about the Cloud Dragon Island?”Qin Yu asked.

The old man swallowed his saliva and said with a trembling voice, “I heard that the Cloud Dragon Island is filled with danger and there is no return. I don’t know how many martial saints have died there...”

The old man paused for a moment when he said this and said mysteriously, “I heard that there is an ancient mighty figure sleeping on this Cloud Dragon Island. Once someone disturbs it, he will definitely be killed!”

“Ancient Mighty Figure?”Yao Meng and the others were surprised.

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and looked at the old man coldly. “Is what you said true?”

“These are all legends. I don’t know whether they are true or not...”the old man said with an embarrassed smile.

“But what I can be sure of is that there are extremely fierce demon beasts guarding this island.”

“Extremely ferocious demonic beasts? How ferocious are they? How are they compared to the Azure Dragon Shark?”Chang Mang walked forward and asked.

The old man shook his head and said, “Compared to the demonic beasts on the Cloud Dragon Island, the azure dragon shark can only be reduced to a belly-wrapped object.”

Hearing this, everyone couldn’t help but gasp.

The azure dragon shark’s strength wasn’t weak. Even Chang Mang and the others had to expend nine oxen and two Tigers’strength to kill it.

They didn’t expect that a demon beast of this level could only be reduced to a belly.

“It is said that the strongest demon beast on Cloud Dragon Island is called Cloud Dragon. It is also the True Guardian Demon Beast on the island,”the old man continued.

“Besides Cloud Dragon, there are also a large number of top-tier demon beasts. I advise you not to go to Cloud Dragon Island.”

The few people present couldn’t help but look at each other.

Qin Yu saw their worries and said, “If any of you are afraid, you can take a boat and leave after you arrive at the Cloud Dragon Island.”

The scene was silent and no one spoke.

“Damn it, why should we be afraid? Our heads are like a bowl with a big scar. What’s there to be afraid of?”Chang Mang said.

“I’m not leaving either.”Chu Hedao followed closely behind.

“Brother Chang Mang is right. We are already here. There’s nothing to be afraid of.”Xiao Yuan also said.

Seeing this, the others also expressed their stance and didn’t plan to leave.

Qin Yu nodded slightly and said, “Alright then. We’ll make another plan when we arrive at Cloud Dragon Island.”

“How should we deal with this old man?”Chang Mang asked.

Qin Yu glanced at him, then raised his finger, and a divine light entered his divine sense.

“I’ve planted a mark in your divine sense. You’d better not plan to escape, or else your body and soul will be destroyed,”Qin Yu warned.

A trace of fear flashed across the old man’s face. He said in a trembling voice, “I... I don’t want to go to Cloud Dragon Island. It’s a place with a slim chance of survival. I...”

“If you dare to talk nonsense again, I’ll kill you right now,”said Qin Yu coldly.

Seeing this, the old man had no choice but to give up and agree.

After that, Qin Yu ordered people to lock the old man in the basement.

The storm was finally over, and the ship continued to set off towards Cloud Dragon Island.

Everyone gathered on the deck and discussed the trip to Cloud Dragon Island.

“I don’t know if what that old man said is true or false. An ancient mighty figure? I don’t think it’s possible,”said Zhuang Teng.

“There’s nothing impossible about it.”Qin Yu shook his head.

“Earth has existed for so many years, so it’s not strange for it to have a mighty figure.”

“What’s more... that old man also said that it’s a sealed almighty realm. This means that that almighty realm has been sealed for many years and is only waiting for the opening of the Holy Region.”

All of this happened to coincide with what Yao Meng said.

“Qin Yu is right. It’s not strange for it to be an Almighty Realm.”Yao Meng said.

“There’s always someone better than us.”Chu Heng could not help but sigh.

They had just entered the martial saint stage. Initially, they thought that they would be invincible in the world. However, they did not expect that there was still a mighty figure in this world.

Most of the time, if one did not reach that stage, one would never be able to see that world.

The difference in stages divided the different worlds.

People who were born in the clouds would see a different world than those who grew up in the soil.

If one had not become a martial saint, they might never have come into contact with the Almighty Realm.

Just like Gong Tianyu, he stubbornly believed that what he saw was the truth of the world, but he did not know that it was only the tip of the iceberg.

The ship continued to move forward. At this rate, they would only need two days to reach the Cloud Dragon Island.

Just as Qin Yu and the others were about to return to their rooms, Gong Tianyu walked over with an embarrassed smile.

“I apologize for my ignorance earlier...”Gong Tianyu said with an embarrassed smile.

“I didn’t expect that you guys are really experts.”

“Alright, if you have anything to say, quickly say it. Don’t waste our time.”Chang Mang was a little impatient.

Gong Tianyu hurriedly waved his hand and said, “It’s fine, it’s fine. I just want to make friends with all of you.”

“I’ve already prepared rooms for all of you. It’s really inappropriate to let all of you stay in the basement earlier.”

Qin Yu was too lazy to argue with such a small figure. He nodded slightly and followed Gong Tianyu into the room.

This time, Gong Tianyu gave the best room to Qin Yu and the others.

After returning to the room, Qin Yu took out the inner core that he had just obtained. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

These two inner core were the size of a fist, and they were emitting a faint light.
