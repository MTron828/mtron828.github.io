Chapter 239: Did I Let You Guys Go? Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

“There’s no need.” The two of them waved their hands.

“Since we’re going to Bai City anyway, we might as well go look for him directly,” Zhang Hua said.

Jiang Gu smiled and said, “That’s even better. I’ll go arrange a car right away!”

The creation of the Divine Medicine would involve countless clans.

No one knew if there would be other prominent families besides those in the Jiang Bei region participating as well.

Moreover, he had countless powerful enemies in the Jiang Bei region alone.

It was naturally best to work with a master.

Qin Yu’s reputation as the King of Chuzhou had long spread. Many families in the Jiang Bei region were filled with interest towards Qin Yu, who suddenly rose to fame.

At this moment, Qin Yu was standing in the vegetable garden while observing a batch of herbs.

“Almost all of the spiritual energy in the spiritual energy gathering formation has been absorbed by these herbs,” Qin Yu said in a low voice.

Fortunately, these herbs were growing vigorously, and their effects could be maximized in the shortest time possible. It wasn’t in vain.

At this moment, Jiang Gu’s car stopped at the door.

Then, Jiang Gu walked in with Zhang Hua and Chen Meng.

“Inner Strength Grandmasters?” Qin Yu sized up the two people and narrowed his eyes.

Updates by

“Mr. Qin!” Jiang Gu walked to Qin Yu quickly.

Then, Jiang Gu explained, “This is the head of the Chen family, Chen Meng. This is Zhang Hua from the Zhang family.”

Qin Yu nodded to them and said politely, “Greetings, seniors.”

Chen Meng sized up Qin Yu’s bright eyes and said, “you’re Qin Yu, the one who beat Jiang Gu?”

Qin Yu smiled and said, “That was all because of luck.” Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Zhang Hua and Chen Meng looked at each other, and their eyes were filled with suspicion.

Qin Yu looked ordinary, and his internal qi was calm. He didn’t look like a top martial artist at all.

“The two of you can take a seat in the room,” Qin Yu said politely.

Then, he turned around and returned to the room to make a pot of tea for them.

After sitting down, Jiang Gu said anxiously, “Mr. Qin, these two are mighty figures of the Jiang Bei region. If we can cooperate with them, we might be able to get a share of the Divine Medicine’s profits.”

Get a share?

Qin Yu couldn’t help but want to laugh.

Half a month ago, Qin Yu really only wanted to get a share.

But with Qin Yu’s current strength, he had changed his mind!

Although he thought so inside, Qin Yu still said politely on the surface, “To be able to work with the two of you is my honor.”

Zhang Hua glanced at Qin Yu and said somewhat proudly, “Rumor has it that there are no talents in Chuzhou. Seeing you today in person is really enlightening.”

“Hehe, my disciple can probably become the King of Chuzhou.”

“Tsk tsk, so the famous King of Chuzhou is just an ordinary young man.”

Although Qin Yu was displeased, he still said politely, “It’s just hype.”

At this time, Chen Meng said, “Speaking of which, I really want to know what level you’re at to be called the King of Chuzhou.”

Qin Yu thought for a moment and said, “According to the division of martial arts, I should be... an Inner Strength Master Hands now.”

When he heard this, Chen Meng immediately spat out a mouthful of water!

Zhang Hua frowned even more tightly.

“Are you kidding? An Inner Strength Master Hands?” Chen Meng said with a skeptical look.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “Yes, to be precise, it’s an Inner Strength Master Hands of the sixth rank.”

“An Inner Strength Master Hands isn’t even qualified to carry our shoes. So the title of King of Chuzhou is just a joke!” Zhang Hua snorted.

Chen Meng also sneered and said, “As if an Inner Strength Master Hands is qualified to cooperate with us? It’s simply a pipe dream!”

Qin Yu scratched his head and said, “It seems that you two came to find me, right?”

Jiang Gu hurriedly explained, “Mr. Qin isn’t an ordinary Inner Strength Master Hands. His strength is beyond imagination. Even an Inner Strength Grandmaster might not be his match!”

“Hahahaha!” Zhang Hua and Chen Meng burst into laughter at the same time!

“Jiang Gu, you’re really a braggart! Even if an Inner Strength Master Hands is remarkable, he is still only a Master Hands!”

“You’re just at the bottom, yet you dare to try to cooperate with us? Jiang Gu, I think you’re just toying with us!”

Anxiety flashed across Jiang Gu’s face.

He said in a somewhat humble tone, “What I said is true! Please think twice, and do it for my sake...”

“And Mr. Qin’s potential is absolutely beyond imagination! If he can get this Divine Medicine, he will definitely...”

“Jiang Gu, you don’t have to be so humble.” At this moment, Qin Yu interrupted Jiang Gu.

He took a sip of tea and said indifferently, “To tell you the truth, I don’t really want to cooperate with you guys. You guys look down on me, and I also look down on you guys.”

When he heard Qin Yu’s words, Jiang Gu’s expression suddenly changed!

It was already very difficult for Jiang Gu to win against Qin Yu!

And Zhang Hua and Chen Meng’s strength was far above Jiang Gu’s!

“You don’t have much ability, but you talk big.”

“Jiang Gu, did you hear that? It’s him who doesn’t want to cooperate with us,” Zhang Hua said with some displeasure.

Chen Meng said with a sarcastic tone, “Sigh, I originally wanted to help you, but I didn’t expect you to be so arrogant. Tsk, in that case, don’t blame us.”

Jiang Gu wanted to say something, but Qin Yu had already stood up and said politely, “If there’s nothing else, the two of you can leave now.”

Zhang Hua and Chen Meng were obviously very unhappy with Qin Yu’s attitude.

“Young people, you have to know your place. Otherwise, you might get yourself into trouble.” Zhang Hua said with a hint of warning.

Qin Yu couldn’t help but laugh. “I’m already polite enough to you guys. If it weren’t for Jiang Gu’s sake, I would have kicked you guys out long ago.”

“You’re too brazen! I’d like to see what you’re capable of as an Inner Strength Master Hands!” Chen Meng suddenly flew into a rage. He waved his hand, and a sharp qi energy came straight for Qin Yu!

Chen Meng’s moves were extremely vicious. He raised his hand and came straight for his vital points!

Qin Yu’s expression turned cold.

They had formed an enmity just like that?

Because both sides had only failed to come to an agreement, Chen Meng wanted to take his life?

This was simply unreasonable!

Just as Qin Yu was about to make a move, Jiang Gu hurriedly took a step forward and raised his hand to block it.

“Boom!”

With a loud bang, a terrifying qi energy spread out in all directions with Jiang Gu as the center!

The entire room instantly collapsed, and Yao Qing was so shaken by this qi energy that he couldn’t stop vomiting blood!

Jiang Gu took a few steps back in succession, and he crashed into the wall fiercely!

Cracks appeared on the wall, and Jiang Gu spat out a mouthful of blood!

Qin Yu’s expression turned even colder, and a strong murderous aura filled his entire body!

Just as Zhang Hua condensed his qi energy again, Jiang Gu hurriedly took a step forward and cupped his hands while saying, “For the sake of our old friendship, please stop...”

Zhang Hua frowned slightly.

He suppressed the qi energy from his body and snickered. “Fine, I’ll spare his life for your sake! Jiang Gu, from now on, we don’t owe each other anything.”

“Thank you, Mr. Zhang...” Jiang Gu endured the pain and cupped his hands while saying.

Zhang Hua snorted coldly and turned around to leave.

“Did I let you guys go?”

At this moment, Qin Yu shouted coldly.

“You injured my people and destroyed my house. Do you want to leave just like that?” Qin Yu said coldly.
