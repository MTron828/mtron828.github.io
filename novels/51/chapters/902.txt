Chapter 903: Chapter 903, the latest instructions from the higher-ups 

He forcefully suppressed the anger in his heart and even suppressed his killing intent.

Qin Yu was very clear that if he went out now, it would be tantamount to sending someone to his death.

However, the myriad ancient Jade’s various maliciousness had already made Qin Yu endure to the extreme.

After the myriad ancient jade left, the pavilion master pushed open the door and entered.

She sat opposite Qin Yu and said, “It’s fine.”

Qin Yu gritted his teeth and asked, “Is this Wan Gu Qiong coming?”

The pavilion master shook his head with a bitter smile and said, “Not really.”

Qin Yu took a deep breath and said, “I will think of a way to kill him as soon as possible!”

“It’s better for you to be careful now. Xu Huaigu has already said that it will be very difficult for the younger generation to become a martial saint in a short period of time.”The pavilion master shook his head and said.

“I have an idea.”Qin Yu took a deep breath.

Then, Qin Yu looked at the pavilion master and said, “Oh right, pavilion master, do you know where senior Jiang he is?”

“Jiang he? Why are you looking for him?”The pavilion master asked in puzzlement.

Qin Yu said, “I want to obtain the nine secrets from him. This way, I will at least have the ability to protect myself.”

“Nine secrets?”The Pavilion Master could not help but smile bitterly.

“Do you know that he is the only one who knows the nine secrets? Even his disciple can’t learn the nine secrets.”

Qin Yu could not help but be speechless.

He knew that the nine secrets were very precious, but he did not expect it to be so precious.

“Of course. I made a bet with him and he promised to teach you the nine secrets.”At this moment, the pavilion master changed the topic.

Then, the Pavilion Master wrote down an address on the paper and gave it to Qin Yu.

“Normally, he would be here.”The pavilion master said.

“However, it is very likely that he is trying to break through to the martial saint stage now.”

Qin Yu took the paper and bowed as he said, “Thank you, Pavilion Master.”

Then, Qin Yu planned to set off to look for Jiang he.

“Little Beauty? Where did you hide?”

At this moment, Wan Gu Qiong’s voice suddenly came from outside!

Pavilion master’s expression immediately changed!

She hurriedly grabbed Qin Yu and made a silent gesture.

Although Qin Yu was full of hatred for Wan Gu Qiong, he also knew that he must not let Wan Gu Qiong discover him at this moment.

The two hid in the secret room, not daring to breathe loudly.

“Little Beauty, where did you run off to?”Wan Gu Qiong’s disgusting voice kept coming from outside.

Qin Yu clenched his fists, his eyes filled with icy cold killing intent. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

A few minutes later, Wan Gu Qiong’s voice finally disappeared.

Pavilion master pulled Qin Yu and waited in the secret chamber for nearly half an hour.

After confirming that Wan Gu Qiong had left, pavilion master opened the Secret Chamber.

“Pavilion Master, if you really can’t do it, you can go to the secret realm first.”Qin Yu frowned and said.

The pavilion master shook his head and said, “I won’t leave the Divine Alchemist Pavilion alone. Moreover... since Xu Huaigu can become a martial saint, I might be able to.”

Qin Yu opened his mouth and then nodded, “Alright, Pavilion Master, Please Take Care.”

After saying goodbye to the pavilion master, Qin Yu left in a hurry and went to look for Jiang he.

...

Jingdu martial arts association.

In front of Gu Xinghe stood Zhai Xing, Du Xuanyu, and the others.

“Still haven’t found him?”Gu Xinghe looked a little unhappy.

Du Xuanyu shook his head and said, “We’ve searched almost all the secret realms, but we haven’t Found Qin Yu.”

“Now we’re guessing that Qin Yu has most likely found a new secret realm and hid in it.”

Gu Xinghe could not help but shout angrily, “Then hurry up and find it! Are you just doing this for nothing? !”

Du Xuanyu’s face turned cold and he said, “Young master Gu, I have to remind you that I’m here to help you, not your subordinate. Even your father has to be polite to me.”

Gu Xinghe gritted his teeth, took a deep breath, and said, “I’m sorry, Master Du. I was out of control.”

Du Xuanyu said in a low voice, “I’ll try my best to find a new mystical realm as soon as possible.”

“I’ll have to Trouble You Then, master Du.”Gu Xinghe bowed and said.

At this moment, Gu Xinghe’s phone rang.

He picked up the phone and saw that it was a notice from the higher-ups.

“Meeting.”The higher-ups were still concise and to the point.

Gu Xinghe did not dare to waste any more time. He rushed to the meeting room of the higher-ups.

Along the way, Gu Xinghe was extremely nervous.

He could not avoid being scolded for not finding Yan Ruoxue.

They arrived at the meeting room.

As soon as they entered, Gu Xinghe realized that the eight higher-ups had already rewarded them.

Gu Xinghe was a little nervous. He walked forward, bowed and said, “Greetings to the higher-ups.”

Before the higher-ups could ask, Gu Xinghe quickly said, “We haven’t found her yet, but don’t worry, I will find Yan Ruoxue within the time limit!”

“No need.”At this time, the higher-ups interrupted Gu Xinghe.

Gu Xinghe was stunned and said anxiously, “Higher-ups, I Promise I will definitely find her within the time limit, I...”

“It’s impossible for you to find her.”One of the higher-ups sighed.

“Yan Ruoxue’s breakthrough speed is faster than we thought.”

“It’s not under our control anymore.”

Gu Xinghe was stunned.

He frowned and asked, “What do you mean?”

The higher-up did not answer. Instead, he said coldly, “Delete all the records of extracting Yan Ruoxue’s blood! Remember, from today onwards, no one is allowed to mention Yan Ruoxue again!”

Although GU Xinghe did not understand, he did not dare to ask further.

“Then... What About Qin Yu?”Gu Xinghe continued to ask.

The higher-ups lowered their voice and said coldly, “The reason we lost Yan Ruoxue was because of Qin Yu! So, no matter what, we have to kill him!”
