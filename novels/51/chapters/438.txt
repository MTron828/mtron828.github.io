Chapter 439: The Strange He Teng Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Qin Yu casually handed over two glasses of wine.

The three of them sipped the wine and started chatting.

“By the way, how long will this trip take?” Qin Yu asked casually.

Fang Yue smiled and said, “About half a month.”

“Half a month?”

Qin Yu couldn’t help but frown.

He subconsciously took out his phone and looked at the date.

June 21st.

There were only two and a half months left until September 9th.

In other words, there were only two months left after getting off this cruise ship.

‘I hope this trip will be fruitful,’ Qin Yu thought to himself.

“I heard that Mr. Qin’s dantian was seriously injured. I don’t know if it’s true or not,” at this moment, He Teng asked.

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and said deliberately, “My dantian was indeed seriously injured. This made many people want to get rid of me to make a name for themselves.”

When He Teng heard this, he sighed and said, “Sigh, that’s really a pity. Mr. Qin is a genius, but you encountered such a disaster.”

From He Teng’s answer, he seemed to have no intention of attacking Qin Yu.

“By the way, what’s the purpose of your trip?” Qin Yu changed the topic and deliberately asked.

He Teng chuckled and said, “To try my luck and see if I can find any treasures.”

“I see. I knew you couldn’t be here for travel,” Qin Yu said indifferently.

He Teng sighed and said, “A trip? People like us don’t have the leisure to travel.”

While the two of them were chatting, a rough-looking man suddenly walked over from not far away.

This man looked very big and burly.

Not only that, but the internal qi on his body was also extremely strong.

“Who is that person?” Qin Yu pointed at the burly man and asked.

Fang Yue said, “He is Meng Wuxiong, who is known as the King of Dongchuan.”

“King of Dongchuan?” Qin Yu’s eyes flashed with a trace of doubt.

Fang Yue explained, “Yes, it is said that he is the top dog in the Dongchuan region. Many years ago, he reached the peak of the Inner Strength Grandmaster Realm.”

He Teng continued, “This person is quite strange. He is from a martial arts aristocratic family with many geniuses. However, Meng Wuxiong was extremely untalented twenty years ago. He was almost given up by his family.”

“Untalented?” Qin Yu, indicating for He Teng to continue, frowned.

He Teng said, “Yes, it is said that he obtained an opportunity. Due to that opportunity, Meng Wuxiong’s strength increased by leaps and bounds.”

“Not only that, but even the entire Meng family rose with the tide. Within a few years, several Inner Strength Grandmasters appeared.”

“As for what that opportunity was, no one knows.”

Hearing He Teng’s words, Qin Yu couldn’t help but rub his chin.

Several Inner Strength Grandmasters appeared within a few years?

This indeed seemed suspicious.

One had to know that in the current era, becoming an Inner Strength Grandmaster required extremely high talent.

In just a few short years, his family had created many Inner Strength Grandmasters. Such luck really made people envious.

“Perhaps the Dongchuan King has something similar to the Enlightenment Tea?” Qin Yu thought to himself excitedly.

If he could snatch this opportunity... He might be able to break through to the Martial Marquis realm within two months!

“Looks like I’ll have to go to Dongchuan if I have the chance,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

“What a coincidence. The few of us seem to have something in common,” At this moment, Fang Yue suddenly said.

Qin Yu glanced at Fang Yue and asked casually, “What do you mean?”

Fang Yue looked at He Teng and said, “Mr. He, although you are quite talented, you can’t be considered number one in the He family, right?”

He Teng nodded and said, “That’s right.”

“It’s said that you were chased by a top-notch martial artist later on. You were heavily injured and almost died. From then on, you became the top dog among the younger generation in the Central Plains, right?” Fang Yue continued to say.

An unnatural look flashed across He Teng’s face.

He waved his hand and said, “Sigh, people say that one can only comprehend techniques when one is in a life-and-death situation. Only after experiencing it did I know that this is true.”

“Also... I met a good master. He was the one who taught me spells,” He Teng said with a smile. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Fang Yue smiled and said, “This can be considered a blessing in disguise.”

“Yeah,” He Teng continued.

“By the way, there’s a friend of mine over there. I’ll go and say hello,” He Teng stood up and said.

After saying that, he turned around and left.

It was obvious that He Teng didn’t want to continue this topic.

After he left, Qin Yu looked at Fang Yue and said, “What did you mean by what you said just now?”

Fang Yue spread her hands and said, “Nothing much. I just saw that you were very interested in him.”

Qin Yu frowned and said, “You said that he experienced a serious injury before becoming the top dog in the Central Plains?”

“Yes.” Fang Yue nodded.

“At that time, even the pharmacist of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion said he would die, but they didn’t expect that he would come back to life a few days later.”

“Oh really?” The interest in Qin Yu’s eyes became more intense.

Fang Yue continued, “Not only that, but after he woke up, his temperament changed drastically. From an arrogant and despotic person, he became gentle and refined.”

“Now, he has even been chosen as the next successor of the He family.”

These words indeed gave Qin Yu much information.

Even the pharmacist of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion had announced he would die, but he had actually come back to life?

And his temperament had also changed drastically?

“Could it be a possession?” Qin Yu suddenly thought of a possibility.

It was very possible!

If He Teng had been possessed by someone, then everything would be explained.

“Did he tell you why he went to Brightheart Island this time?” Qin Yu asked.

Fang Yue shook her head and said, “He didn’t say anything. He just said that he was going to try his luck.”

“Try his luck... impossible.” Qin Yu took a deep breath.

As he was speaking, He Teng walked back from not far away.

He said with a smile, “Mr. Qin, Miss Fang, I went to the auction just now and thought it was a secular auction, but I didn’t expect to have an unexpected harvest.”

“Oh really?” Qin Yu raised his eyebrows.

He Teng flipped his palm, and they saw a bead lying in his hand.

This bead didn’t look much different from an ordinary night-luminescent bead, but there was a trace of extremely dense spiritual energy on it.

“This is... an inner core?” Qin Yu’s pupils suddenly constricted.

He Teng said with some surprise, “Mr. Qin, you also know about inner cores?”

“Yes, I swallowed one before. Speaking of which, I have to thank Miss Fang,” Qin Yu said as he glanced at Fang Yue.

He Teng’s expression was a little strange.

“The inner core that Miss Fang swallowed is a Spirit Pill,” He Teng said.

“Spirit Pill?” Qin Yu didn’t know anything about this term.

He Teng nodded and said, “The inner core can only be used to increase cultivation, but the Spirit Pill... has the attributes of a demonic beast. For example, the Spirit Fox inner core that Miss Fang swallowed.”

Speaking up to this point, He Teng looked at Qin Yu and asked, “What Mr. Qin swallowed, could it also be a Spirit Pill?”

“Yes.” Qin Yu didn’t hide anything.

He Teng’s pupils suddenly constricted, and a mysterious look flashed through his eyes.

That look was extremely strange. Although it was only a flash, it still couldn’t escape Qin Yu’s eyes.
