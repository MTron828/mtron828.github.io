Bai Zizai’s hands moved slightly. They overlapped in an instant.

A white light appeared in his hand. This light slowly rotated like the air current.

In the next moment, time and space seemed to have frozen.

A red line suddenly appeared on the neck of one of the cultivators who had escaped near Qin Yu. Then, his head was sucked into the old man’s hand. Hundreds of heads were pulled into Bai Zizai’s hands in an instant.

He casually threw the heads aside like trash.

Qin Yu’s scalp felt like it was going to explode. He could not see how this old man attacked at all.

An inexplicable force directly cut off the heads of the people around him and then appeared in the old man’s hands.

Even Qin Ji’s head was in this pile of heads.

Previously, Qin Yu was not confident he could defeat Qin Ji.

Especially that terrifying strange power, which made every part of her body become a sharp weapon for killing.

She could even suppress Aiden, who had cultivated peak power until he could not breathe.

However, her head was thrown to the side like trash now. She could not even withstand a blow from the old man.

“Who the he*l is this old man?”

Qin Yu’s body did not dare to make any movements as he shot Chang Mang a look.

However, his heart turned cold when he saw Chang Mang’s deathly expression.

He had originally thought that this fellow might be Chang Mang’s master or something, but now it seemed like it was not the case. “Kid, let me ask you a question.”

He walked to the front of a fat man with a kind smile.

“What if a person reaches the peak of his cultivation and can’t continue breaking through?”

The old man directly spoke before the fatty could agree to answer.

“There is no end to cultivation. The most important thing is one’s heart. If one’s heart doesn’t die, there will always be a possibility of a breakthrough. The most important thing is senior’s elegance has already reached an unprecedented cultivation realm. Such inhuman strength will definitely have a breakthrough one day!”

Fatty thought for a moment before he answered. His words were very satisfactory.

Not only did he answer the old man’s question, but he also flattered him. “How can one continue cultivating if one’s heart dies?”

The old man shook his head and directly removed the fatty’s head.

“Don’t kill me! Don’t kill me! Let me think about it again. Taoist priest, please wait for me to think about it again!”Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Fatty cried out mournfully, not realizing that his head had been taken off.

The terrifying scene made the surroundings deathly silent. Even the sound of breathing could be heard.

“What kind of sacrifices must I make to pursue the peak of the Dao?”

He took a step forward and arrived in front of another person.

The middle-aged man’s expression changed drastically and his body trembled slightly.

His brows were tightly locked together. He used all the knowledge he had in his life and thought of a perfect answer.

“The peak of the Dao is the root of the divine soul. How can you think for so long?”

The old man shook his head and took off the head of the middle-aged man in front of him, casually throwing it to the side.

“How should I place the heads?”

He took a step forward and came to Aiden with a smile in his eyes.

“Senior!”

After what happened to the people in front, Aiden didn’t dare to think for too long.

He gritted his teeth and said.

“It’s 3352 meters long. The height can be stacked according to the normal direction.”

He did not give any other explanation.

This was because Aiden was answering according to the location of the mountain peak that Bai Zizai was at.

This was also the distance that the old man had placed the heads.

At the same time, a teardrop-like mark slowly appeared on his forehead.

An internal qi slowly spread out from this teardrop. It was extremely faint.

This was the internal qi of Saint Lord Galadriel, the Fairy Queen. She was also the person who guided Aiden here.

Aiden could only hope that the terrifying old man could have some friendship with Saint Galadriel.

“The position is only related to one’s habits. I’m not the only standard.”

The old man sighed and grabbed Aiden’s handsome head as if he was grabbing an apple.

Chang Mang’s face turned ashen.

It was over! It was over!

Before this old man killed someone, he liked to ask people a fake question.

Those on the Nine Nether Cliff all year round knew this old man had always been at the mountain peak. No one dared to challenge him. One would be almost dead when he asked a question.

There had been no exceptions in the past five hundred years.

“If a person abandoned his wife and children to pursue the Dao in his heart, do you think this choice is correct?”

Bai Zizai took another step forward and arrived in front of Qin Yu.

He was here!

Qin Yu’s heart started beating rapidly.

The old man was somewhat absent-minded as he stared at the side.

Qin Yu’s soul power unexpectedly sensed that there seemed to be a flash of sadness when the old man was talking about this problem. Qin Yu’s divine soul was now powerful to an exaggerated extent.

Therefore, Qin Yu felt that he had not detected wrongly. Moreover, the old man’s question was different from before.

This was a question of right or wrong!

Through his previous judgment, Qin Yu felt that it was useless to explain too much.

This old man was only killing people through his preferences.

“It’s not worth it!”

Qin Yu shook his head.

“Path of Heaven is the end of this world. Perhaps even this world doesn’t know if it’s worth it. Why are you talking nonsense?”

“F*ck you!”

Before he could finish his words, a violent internal qi erupted from Chang Mang’s body.

The red and black power intertwined in his fist and fell directly on the old man.

Whoosh!

His head appeared in the old man’s hand. Bai Zizai glanced at Qin Yu.

In the next moment, the world in front of Qin Yu’s eyes suddenly tilted.

Qin Yu’s eyes bulged out at this moment. He wanted to clench his fists tightly.

However, he could only feel his intense emotions. He could not control his body.

He was unwilling! He regretted it!

He had used all his strength, but he had encountered such a baffling old man who removed his head as he wished.

If he died in battle, he might be able to accept it.

But this kind of death made him feel extremely unwilling. Furthermore, he had caused Chang Mang’s death!

Perhaps Chang Mang wouldn’t have died if he hadn’t appeared here!

“Idiot! Why did he attack?”

The Chang Mang in his memories was still the same.

Although he Imew Bai Zizai’s strength, he still rushed forward without hesitation when Qin Yu encountered danger.

The bracelet on Qin Yu’s left hand instantly emitted a layer of light.

This was one of the two bracelets the monk from the Faramita had given Qin Yu on the spaceship.

According to Luo Xueyi’s translation, the bracelet on the left should be ‘do-over.’

This layer of light spread out at a speed difficult to see with the naked eye..
