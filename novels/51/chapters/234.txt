Chapter 235: The Power of the Ancestor! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

A hundred-year-old Divine Medicine was indeed precious. Families of martial artists and the wealthy upper class would usually collect one or more of them.

Therefore, after the news spread, many people came to look for Jiang Gu.

The Divine Sect Pill was indeed a divine medicine to martial artists.

However, to Qin Yu, it was nothing.

The pill refining technique left behind by his father was extremely exquisite, far surpassing that of the modern era!

Even the Divine Alchemist Pavilion, which was revered as legendary by the world, might not be able to compare to it.

Relying on the batch of herbs left behind by Xiong Yi, Qin Yu spent three days refining a total of seven Divine Sect Pills.

“Yao Qing, send this Divine Sect Pill to the Jiang family.” Qin Yu wrapped up the seven Divine Sect Pills and handed them over to Yao Qing.

“And send this one to the Wei family. Tell Wei Tao that this pill can save his son.” Qin Yu carefully wrapped up the other pill and said.

Yao Qing didn’t have the guts to delay things. After taking the Divine Sect Pill, he quickly left.

After Yao Qing left, Qin Yu originally wanted to take care of the vegetable garden. However, at this moment, a piercing pain suddenly appeared in Qin Yu’s head!

“What’s wrong? Have you forgotten your master?”

A sinister voice entered Qin Yu’s mind!

This intense pain was hard for Qin Yu to bear.

Under this intense pain, Qin Yu took out the stone statue and touched it.

A light flashed and Qin Yu’s spiritual sense was instantly sucked in.

The moment he entered the stone statue, a terrifying pressure pressed down on him!

“Boom!” A loud sound rang out!

Qin Yu’s entire body was smacked onto the ground!

“You want to trick me?” The ancestor said coldly.

Qin Yu hurriedly said, “I don’t have the guts to. How would I have the guts to trick you...”

The ancestor snorted coldly and said, “How’s the matter of the seal? Any progress?”

Qin Yu hurriedly said, “I’ll succeed very soon. Give me a few more days, and I’ll definitely bring you out!”

“Boom!”

Another huge palm slammed onto Qin Yu’s body fiercely!

“Ah!” This huge palm was extremely powerful, and even Qin Yu couldn’t help but wail in pain!

The ancestor glared at Qin Yu and berated, “You better know your place! You are only my slave! I don’t care about your matters! My matter is the priority! Immediately find a way to break the seal!”

Qin Yu cursed inside!

Slave?!

This old b*stard really treated Qin Yu as his slave!

“I just received some special news.” At this time, Qin Yu suddenly thought of something.

He had an idea and said, “I found out that Qin Yu actually has the legendary chaotic body! No wonder he is so talented!”

When he heard the words “chaotic body”, the ancestor’s expression changed drastically!

The black energy inside the stone statue rolled over, as if it was going to swallow the whole world!

“Is what you said true? !” The ancestor stared at Qin Yu and said.

Qin Yu hurriedly nodded and said, “Yes! I have fought with him a few times, so there is absolutely no mistaking it!”

“Hahahaha!” The ancestor couldn’t help but laugh out loud in excitement!

That laughter was like rolling thunder, striking Qin Yu’s spiritual sense and almost causing him to faint!

“Legend has it that the primal chaos body is the number one physique in the world. Its physical body is extremely tough and fierce, and is invincible among those of the same level!”

“If I can obtain the primal chaos body, who in the world wouldn’t be afraid of me?” The ancestor laughed out loud again!

Number one physique in the world? Its physical body was extremely tough and fierce? Invincible among those of the same level?

Qin Yu couldn’t help but feel secretly shocked inside!

No wonder his body had been improving again and again during the Foundation Establishment Stage!

“Kid, no matter what, you must get this chaotic body.” The ancestor looked at Qin Yu coldly and said.

Qin Yu hurriedly nodded and said, “Don’t worry. Give me a little more time, and I promise to let you leave this d*mn place!”

The ancestor said coldly, “I can’t wait any longer! I don’t want to stay in this place for a minute longer!”

Qin Yu said awkwardly, “I also want to be faster, but now that the sect is in danger, I’m not a match for Qin Yu...”

The ancestor was silent for a moment, then he looked at Qin Yu and said slowly, “I can lend you my inner strength for the time being.”

Qin Yu was stunned, and then he said happily, “Is what you said true?”

The ancestor nodded and said, “Yes, but this technique consumes a lot of my energy. It might very well affect my foundation.”

“But as long as I can obtain the chaos body, this sacrifice is nothing.” The ancestor changed the topic and said.

Qin Yu was ecstatic inside!

This old b*stard actually wanted to lend his strength to him!

Qin Yu just happened to be worrying about how to snatch that Divine Medicine!

“May I ask... what realm are you at exactly?” Qin Yu probed.

The ancestor snorted lightly. “When I was at my peak, I was a Martial Grandmaster. Now that my strength has been diminished, perhaps I can only reach the Inner Strength Grandmaster realm.”

Martial Grandmaster realm?

This old b*stard actually surpassed the Inner Strength Grandmaster realm?

“That’s definitely enough!” Qin Yu hurriedly nodded.

“As long as I can reach the Inner Strength Grandmaster realm, killing Qin Yu will be easy!” Qin Yu said excitedly.

The ancestor nodded slightly. He looked coldly at Qin Yu and said, “How long do you need?”

Qin Yu thought for a moment and said, “One month! Within one month, I will definitely bring you out of this d*mned place!”

“No, it’s too long,” the ancestor said coldly.

“I will give you at most twenty days.”

Qin Yu sneered inside and thought to himself, I knew you would bargain. Fortunately, I said ten days in advance!

Twenty days was completely enough for Qin Yu!

“Remember, you only have twenty days,” the ancestor whispered.

In the next second, Qin Yu’s spiritual sense returned to his body.

As soon as Qin Yu got up from the ground, the mark in his mind began to shine.

Then, a terrifying internal force burst out from the mark!

This internal force circulated around Qin Yu’s body and followed Qin Yu’s meridians while reincarnating twenty times!

Finally, this internal force poured into Qin Yu’s Dantian!

A terrifying force suddenly burst out!

Qin Yu felt that his body had undergone a qualitative change, and his strength had increased by dozens of times in an instant!

“Boom!”

A terrifying internal qi burst out from Qin Yu’s body!

The powerful internal qi turned the surrounding area into flat ground!

Even the ground under Qin Yu’s feet was covered with dense cracks!

“Boom!”

Finally, the ground couldn’t take it anymore and started to sink! Finally, it turned into a huge pit that was several meters wide!

“Swish!”

Soon, a ray of golden light flew out from the huge pit! Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Qin Yu’s entire body was covered in golden light. Under the sunlight, he was shining brilliantly, as if a God had descended to the mortal world!

This was a sense of power Qin Yu had never felt before! It was difficult for Qin Yu to control it for a moment!

“So this is an Inner Strength Grandmaster’s power...” Qin Yu clenched his fist and the corners of his mouth curled up into a sneer.
