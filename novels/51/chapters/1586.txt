Chapter 1587: Chapter 1,587, Xiao Yu again

Zhuo Jing opened his mouth as if he wanted to persuade Qin Yu to give up, but after thinking about it, he only smiled and didn’t say anything.

“Okay, leave these materials to me. I’ll help you gather them as soon as possible,”Zhuo Jing said.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “Thank you.” Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

After explaining this matter, Qin Yu took out the second piece of paper.

This piece of paper was the one that Xiao Hai asked Qin Yu to look for.

This person’s name was ye Nan, and the piece of paper indicated his residence.

According to Xiao Hai, Ye Nan was extremely strong, but he had an extremely strange personality. He was extremely harsh and full of bad intentions. It was definitely not an easy task to persuade him.

However, Qin Yu had already made preparations. At most, he would pay something. As long as he could persuade him to come out of the mountain, it would be enough.

Therefore, Qin Yu followed the address on the note and sped towards ye Nan’s residence.

...

At the northern border.

Xiao Hai stood by the bank of the Dead River and looked across from him.

His mind was full of worries, and his eyes revealed a trace of determination.

“Are you really going to do this?”

At this moment, an aged voice came from behind Xiao Hai.

He turned around and saw that the person who came was actually a monk from Hongxi!

If Qin Yu knew about this, he would definitely be shocked!

Xiao Hai did not turn around. He continued to look at the other side and said slowly, “This is the only way.”

“It’s not that easy to cross the river of death.”Monk Hongxi sighed slightly.

Xiao hai sighed and said, “That’s right. All those who cross the river of death are injured...”

The monk of Hongxi was silent for a moment and said, “Why don’t you think of other ways? There are many talented people in the South Province. I believe there are other ways.”

Xiao Hai turned his head and looked at the monk of Hongxi in front of him. He said, “Once the master of the northern land awakens, who can defeat him? If we don’t kill him before he awakens, it will be a disaster for everyone.”

“So you sent Qin Yu away and dismissed everyone at the border, planning to cross the river of death alone and get rid of the Master of the Northern Lands?”The monk’s voice trembled slightly.

Xiao Hai smiled and said, “Yes.”

“If Qin Yu comes back, will he go to the river of death with you?”The monk in Hongxi asked in a deep voice.

Xiao Hai shook his head and said, “He can’t come back in time. I gave him two difficult problems. Huangji glaze is in Huangji Mountain, and no one can find her. Ye Nan has a dark and vicious nature, and Qin Yu will never be able to persuade him.”

Hearing this, the monk of Hongxi couldn’t help but sigh.

He looked at Xiao Hai and said slowly, “You two brothers are really strange... If your brother knew about this, I wonder if he would stop you.”

“He will definitely stop me,”Xiao Hai said in a deep voice, “So he must not know.”

At this point, Xiao Hai’s rough palm placed on his mask.

He slowly took off his mask, revealing an extremely familiar face.

This face actually looked exactly the same as the sect leader of the Tianyun sect!

Anyone who saw it would probably be shocked!

“What he desires is an opponent, what I desire is peace,”Xiao Hai muttered in a low voice, as if he was talking about something on his mind.

“Then why didn’t he go to the Holy Region, why did he stay in the South Region?”The monk of the Hon XI asked.

Xiao Hai said slowly, “Perhaps he was also waiting for the death river to disappear...”

The monk of Hongxi put his palms together and said, “Then I wish you all the best.”

After saying that, he stepped on the snow and slowly disappeared into the vast snow.

If the conversation between the two were to be spread out, it would definitely shock the whole world!

Xiao Hai and the sect master of the Tianyun sect were actually twins! No wonder he had been wearing a mask all this time! It was most likely to block this face!

“I will never let the Lord of the northern lands come back to life...”Xiao Hai clenched his fists, his eyes filled with determination.

...

On the other side, Qin Yu was speeding towards ye Nan’s residence.

Along the way, the speed of the Divine Hawk was extremely fast. However, after many days of long journey, the Divine Hawk also appeared extremely tired and let out waves of mournful cries.

Qin Yu patted his head and said with some guilt, “I’m sorry. I’ve neglected your feelings these few days.”

The Godly Eagle raised his head and let out a loud and resounding cry. It was earth-shattering, as if it was expressing its hidden bitterness.

Fortunately, there was a city below. Although this city was quite remote, it could at least let the godly eagle rest for a while.

Therefore, Qin Yu found a tavern and temporarily stopped there.

He took out a few pill pills from his pocket and stuffed them into the divine eagle’s mouth.

After eating the pill, the Divine Eagle suddenly looked much more energetic.

However, these pill pills needed a certain amount of time to be absorbed, so Qin Yu could only stop there temporarily.

Taking advantage of the time when the Divine Eagle consumed the pill, Qin Yu walked into the tavern and found a place to sit down.

He ordered a few dishes and a pot of wine. While eating and drinking, he waited.

There were very few people in the tavern, and the people eating in the tavern were not very strong.

Perhaps it was because of this reason that this place was not invaded by the northern cultivators. It could be considered a pure land.

“HM?”

At this moment, Qin Yu suddenly sensed a powerful and strange internal Qi.

He closed his eyes slightly and tried to sense this internal QI, trying to find the source of this internal Qi.

For some reason, Qin Yu felt that this internal Qi was extremely familiar, as if it came from a familiar person.

Qin Yu frowned slightly. He left behind the spirit coin and slowly stood up to walk out of the tavern.

Following that, Qin Yu followed this internal Qi and shot toward the source of the internal Qi!

As Qin Yu sped forward, the internal Qi got closer and closer, and the familiar feeling became more and more obvious.

Soon, Qin Yu saw a figure in a mountain range near the city.

The figure was tall and slender, with his back facing Qin Yu. His beautiful hair hung behind his shoulders, and the internal Qi on his body was calm and extremely overbearing. It was like a lotus flower that could only be seen from afar and not touched!

“Xiao Yu? !”

Qin Yu quickly guessed the identity of this person. He hurriedly rushed forward, afraid that Xiao Yu would leave!

Soon, Qin Yu arrived in front of Xiao Yu.

What surprised Qin Yu was that she was not wearing a mask. Instead, her real face was revealed.

Looking at this familiar yet somewhat unfamiliar face, Qin Yu had an indescribable feeling in his heart.

“Xiao Yu, you...”

Qin Yu opened his mouth, but for a moment, he didn’t know what to say.

Xiao Yu just looked at Qin Yu. There wasn’t the slightest emotion on her face, and her eyes were empty and cold.

Ever since Xiao Yu obtained the mask, she was like a completely different person. She was no longer as mischievous as before. Instead, it made people shudder.

“Are You Waiting for me? Where have you been during this period of time?”Qin Yu asked as he tried to sense the fluctuations of Xiao Yu’s internal Qi.

Unfortunately, Qin Yu could not see her strength at all.

“Qin Yu, so you are here...”

At this moment, a black radiance suddenly surged in front of Qin Yu. Then, several black-robed men stepped out of the void.
