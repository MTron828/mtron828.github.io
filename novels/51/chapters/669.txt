Chapter 670: The Furious Qin Yu! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

The material used in this prison wasn’t Black Gold Stone, but a true rock that was even harder than Black Gold Stone!

This material could be called a true treasure of nature, and its hardness was far above that of Black Gold Stone.

Apart from this, Qin Yu also learned that Martial Saint weapons were hung around this prison.

Therefore, it wasn’t so easy to forcefully save people.

“If we can only resurrect the two male corpses, there shouldn’t be a problem,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

“Oh right, do you see that big door?” At this moment, someone beside him asked.

Qin Yu followed his gaze and nodded. “Yes, I’ve heard that the people locked inside that big door are even more powerful people.”

“That’s right. It’s said that the people locked inside are either Martial Saints or people close to Martial Saints.”

Upon hearing these words, Qin Yu’s eyes immediately widened.

“The Jingdu Martial Arts Association can really imprison Martial Saints?” Qin Yu couldn’t help but swallow hard.

The person next to him smiled and said, “Don’t forget that the Jingdu Martial Arts Association has existed for many years. Martial Saints are indeed very rare now, but what about a hundred years ago?”

“At that time, the Jingdu Martial Arts Association’s power was also much stronger.”

Qin Yu frowned slightly and said, “In other words... those people were imprisoned a hundred years ago?”

“That’s right! Of course, this is only our guess.”

Qin Yu couldn’t help but look solemn.

Even the Martial Saints had been imprisoned by them. The power of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association was probably not that simple.

In the outside world.

Qu Xie was sitting in his office, waiting for the document to be handed out.

Ten minutes later, Xia Hang walked in from outside.

He placed the document in his hand in front of Qu Xie and said, “The document is here.”

Qu Xie’s eyes lit up. He hurriedly picked up the document and read it carefully.

“It’s finally here!” Qu Xie couldn’t help but take a deep breath, and the corners of his mouth curled into a sneer.

He threw the document to Xia Hang and said, “Then hurry up and execute him. Don’t waste any more time.”

Xia Hang opened his mouth. He wanted to stall for time, but he was afraid that Qu Xie would be suspicious.

Therefore, Xia Hang could only nod and say, “I got it.”

After turning around and walking out of Qu Xie’s office, Xia Hang’s frown deepened.

Several days had passed in the blink of an eye, but Qin Yu, who had been imprisoned, didn’t make any movements.

What exactly was his plan? How was he going to escape?

In the office, Qu Xie immediately informed everyone of this news.

He informed everyone, including the Yan family and the Han family, as long as they had a grudge against Qin Yu.

In the end, the execution time was set at noon the next day.

People like the Yan family were overjoyed when they heard the news.

They naturally wouldn’t miss such a thing.

Time flew by, and in the blink of an eye, the next day arrived.

In the early morning, the entire prison was filled with an inexplicable atmosphere of sadness.

“There isn’t much time left for you. You should cherish it,” a prison patrol officer said with a faint smile.

As soon as these words were said, the sad atmosphere became even more intense.

On the other side, Yan Ruoxue’s face was extremely pale.

She clenched her teeth and said in a low voice, “Qin Yu, I...”

Qin Yu smiled and said, “Don’t worry too much. I was able to escape from death last time. Maybe I can do it this time.”

Even though that was the case, Yan Ruoxue’s tears still fell.

She sobbed and said, “Qin Yu, I’ve let you down... If I’m lucky enough to escape this time, you... Don’t bother about me anymore. I don’t want to see anything happen to you...”

Qin Yu opened his mouth and was about to speak when Qu Xie walked in with his men.

There were two people beside him. They were holding a strange instrument in their hands.

The instrument looked like a copper pot, but it was smaller than an ordinary copper pot.

“Qin Yu, the documents have been sent. The punishment will be carried out this afternoon,” Qu Xie said indifferently.

Qin Yu looked at Qu Xie coldly and said, “Old man, if I don’t die this time, I will kill you.”

Qu Xie sneered. “Do you think you still have a chance?”

At this point, Qu Xie paused for a moment and said with some amusement, “Before I die, I plan to give you a surprise. Haven’t you always wanted to know how we treat Yan Ruoxue?”

After saying that, Qu Xie waved his hand.

The two people beside him immediately walked toward Yan Ruoxue.

The two of them stood on Yan Ruoxue’s side. They seemed to be chanting some spell. Soon, the tubes on Yan Ruoxue’s body began to flash with runes.

As the runes appeared, the blood in Yan Ruoxue’s body began to flow out of the tube.

Yan Ruoxue’s face instantly turned extremely pale!

The intense pain made Yan Ruoxue break out in cold sweat, and her body trembled slightly.

However, in order to not let Qin Yu worry, Yan Ruoxue gritted her teeth and didn’t say a word!

The blood flowed into the two copper pots through the tube.

As the blood flowed, Yan Ruoxue’s face turned paler, and her clothes were wet with sweat.

Qin Yu’s eyes widened and he was furious!

He grabbed the railing and shouted angrily, “Qu Xie! F * ck you!”

Qu Xie laughed and said, “What? You can’t take it anymore?”

Qin Yu glared at Qu Xie, and the murderous aura on his body almost covered the entire prison!

His eyes were scarlet red, and the veins on his arms bulged like a dragon!

“Qu Xie! I will definitely kill you! I will definitely kill you!” Qin Yu’s furious roar reverberated in the prison for a long time!

Qu Xie sneered and ordered expressionlessly, “Increase the strength!”

“Yes!”

The two people started chanting again! The runes on the pipe glowed even brighter!

Blood flowed out at an accelerated speed, and the pain that Yan Ruoxue suffered instantly increased by several times!

But even so, Yan Ruoxue still didn’t say anything. She bit her red lips with her teeth, and because she used too much strength, her lips were bitten until they bled!

“How touching. How can you hold back your screams?” Qu Xie said in surprise.

The Qu Xie in front of him was like a demon who killed without batting an eye!

“Qu Xie... I will definitely tear you into pieces. Definitely!” Qin Yu’s internal qi instantly soared!

However, Qu Xie sneered and said, “Continue to increase the strength! I want to see how long she can hold back!”

“How dare you!”

Qin Yu’s anger completely exploded at this moment!

He roared and punched the railing!

Something horrifying happened!

The railing was bent a little under this punch!

“How... How is this possible?!” Qu Xie stared at Qin Yu.

At this moment, Qin Yu’s hair was flapping crazily, his eyes were red, and his aura was extremely cold!
