Chapter 1283: Chapter 1,283 was only in the nascent soul stage 

Qin Yu, who had opened the fifth level of the fighting word formula, had his strength greatly increased!

His pair of already worn-out palms suddenly exerted force, and the bones of his hands actually directly pierced into the stone ball!

This stone ball that was spinning actually stopped in an instant!

“Ah! ! !”

Qin Yu’s mouth roared incessantly. He raised both his arms and fiercely threw this stone ball out!

The stone ball flew into the sky and crashed into the forest! Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

The surrounding people were shocked! Qin Yu’s sudden counterattack shocked them!

Qin Yu’s hands were bleeding. The bones exposed in the air looked extremely strange.

But no one dared to doubt the power of those hands. It was the power that forcefully grabbed the golden wheel!

“Whoosh!”

In a short moment, the golden wheel burst out from the forest.

His body was also bleeding. A large piece of gray stone had been crushed by Qin Yu, and it was bleeding.

Although this layer of gray stone looked like armor, it was actually not. This was his own physical body under the enhancement of spells!

Qin Yu knew that the fighting formula could not be maintained for too long, so he did not waste any time and quickly rushed toward the Golden Wheel!

Jin Lun did not dare to be negligent and immediately clenched his fist to meet the attack.

“Kacha!”

The collision this time made people’s eyeballs drop!

Qin Yu, who was at a disadvantage just a moment ago, now smashed the gray stone on Jin Lun’s fist into pieces with one punch!

“Ah! !”

Jin Lun immediately felt pain and clenched his fist to retreat.

However, Qin Yu did not give him any chance at all. Without saying a word, he launched a set of combined punches.

“Bang, Bang, Bang!”The sound of the fists was incessant. With each punch, a piece of the gray stone on Jin Lun’s body would shatter.

This was the shattering of his physical body. His enormous body could not withstand it at all.

Fresh blood gushed out. The Purple Phoenix blood seemed to have been exhausted at this moment.

Qin Yu did not have any signs of stopping. He had to defeat Jin Lun completely before the fighting word formula disappeared!

In the blink of an eye, dozens of punches landed on Jin Lun’s body. Jin Lun’s body was almost shattered, turning him into a bloody man.

“Go to hell!”Qin Yu’s eyes were wide open. His furious voice was like thunder, shaking the entire mountain forest.

At this moment, leaves fell and rocks rolled down.

Qin Yu’s punch was aimed at Jin Lun’s head!

Once it landed, even if his head was made of steel, it would be smashed into minced meat!

“Buzz!”

At this moment, a ray of light enveloped Jin Lun and blocked Qin Yu’s invincible punch.

The powerful recoil forced Qin Yu back a few steps, and that Ray of light also trembled slightly.

Turning around, he saw the group leader holding a huge magical artifact made of white bones.

The layer of light that covered the Golden Wheel’s body was emitted from this magical artifact.

“Enough. I’ve said it before. No one must die today.”The group leader looked at Qin Yu and slowly said.

Although Qin Yu looked down on the golden wheel, he had no choice but to listen to the group leader’s words.

Moreover, the fifth level of Qin Yu’s fighting word technique couldn’t last for long. If the team leader insisted on protecting Jin Lun, Qin Yu would be helpless, so he might as well do him a favor.

Qin Yu looked at Jin Lun and said coldly, “For the sake of the team leader, I’ll let you off today.”

Jin Lun had become a bloody man. Although he was angry, he had lost the ability to continue fighting. Therefore, he didn’t say anything, and the stone transformation art also disappeared.

Guan Zhuangzhuang quickly walked to Qin Yu. He Sized Qin Yu up and said, “Are you okay?”

Qin Yu waved his hand and said, “I just suffered a little injury.”

There was nothing he could do. After all, Qin Yu’s realm was too low, and he did not have the support of spiritual power. All of his abilities could be said to be the instinct of life. There was no technique to speak of.

Jing Bai also walked in front of Qin Yu and said in a deep voice, “Go to the infirmary. There will be someone there to treat you.”

Qin Yu nodded. He walked toward the infirmary with Guan Zhuang.

The crowd slowly faded away, and Jin Lun also walked toward the infirmary with the support of his followers.

Along the way, Jin Lun’s face was extremely gloomy. His blood spilled all over the ground, attracting many demon beasts to follow him.

These demon beasts didn’t dare to sneak attack Jin Lun. They only watched coldly from behind.

“This Qin Yu...”Jin Lun couldn’t help but grit his teeth.

“Boss, that Kid was just lucky. Otherwise, he definitely wouldn’t be your match!”

“What are you talking about? It was clearly a draw today, and boss didn’t lose!”

“That’s right. If the team leader doesn’t make a move, it’s still uncertain who will win and who will lose.”

“Team leader is nothing. Team leader has to give face to boss. Sooner or later, boss will replace him!”

Jin Lun didn’t say a word, but he knew very well in his heart that if that punch really landed, he would either die or be crippled.

Almost everyone in the hunter organization was discussing this battle.

Qin Yu’s performance had indeed shocked them greatly.

And this made Zhong Wu even more convinced of his own thoughts:

This Qin Yu must have come from a large sect or a large aristocratic family!

...

In the medical room.

A pharmacist wrapped Qin Yu’s arm and gave him a few pills.

Guan Zhuang acted as a temporary escort. He sat by Qin Yu’s bed and carefully fed Qin Yu the pills.

Even though this action was a little strange, Qin Yu’s hands were indeed unable to move.

As he lay on the bed, he felt slightly uneasy.

Jin Lun was at the intermediate stage of the Almighty Realm, and the people sent by the Heavenly Cloud sect were also at the intermediate stage of the Almighty Realm.

However, in terms of resources, the Heavenly Cloud Sect’s spells were many times stronger than Jin Lun’s.

“I really didn’t expect that a mere intermediate stage of the Almighty Realm would be able to break through my defense.”Qin Yu looked at his hands and couldn’t help but sigh.

Guan Zhuang rolled his eyes and said, “Enough. If he can’t even break through your defense, how embarrassing would that be?”

“Besides, he probably contributed half of the credit to that Purple Phoenix Blood. Without that Purple Phoenix Blood, I think it would be difficult.”

Qin Yu didn’t say anything, but he was faintly worried in his heart.

It probably wouldn’t be long before the people of the Heavenly Cloud sect found this place.

“By the way, what realm are you at exactly?”Guan Zhuang suddenly asked.

Qin Yu thought for a moment and said, “If we talk about realm, before I lost my spiritual power, I should only be a martial saint.”

“Martial saint? What is that?”Guan Zhuang was stunned.

Only then did Qin Yu remember that martial saint was only a name in the martial arts world on Earth.

Thus, he explained, “It’s the nascent soul stage.”

“Nascent Soul Stage?”Guan Zhuangzhuang stood up abruptly.

“You’re bullshitting me. You’re Only a nascent soul. What qualifications do you have to fight against a mighty figure?”

“I’m not laughing at you, but killing a nascent soul is like squashing an ant, let alone a golden wheel.”
