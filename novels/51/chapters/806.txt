Their eyes met, and Zheng Ke walked quickly towards Qin Yu.

“You are Qin Yu?”Zheng Ke Sized Qin Yu up.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “That’s right.”

Zheng Ke didn’t say much, and only asked, “When do we start?”

“The sooner the better,”Qin Yu said.

Every minute and second was time to Qin Yu.

Zheng Ke was silent for a moment and said, “Then we’ll Take Action Tonight. You lead the way.”

“Okay.”Qin Yu immediately agreed.

Then, Qin Yu planned to bring Zheng Ke back to his private room.

However, Zheng Ke shook his head and said, “I still have some things to deal with. I’ll contact you later tonight.”

After saying this, Zheng Ke turned around and left

Qin Yu looked at his back and thought for a moment. Then, he snorted and secretly followed him.

...

It was noon when Qin Yu returned to his private room.

The moustache man asked, “How is it?”

Qin Yu drank a mouthful of water and sneered, “It’s quite good. The Hong Yi sect has indeed sent people, but whether or not they can open the secret realm is unknown.”

The moustache man on the side said, “Although the current Hong Yi sect is not as powerful as the Jingdu Martial Arts Association, their foundation can not be underestimated. They control a lot of secret techniques.”

Qin Yu glanced at the moustache man and said, “This is also one of the reasons why the Jingdu Martial Arts Association annihilated the Hong Yi sect, right?”

“I don’t know.”The moustache man shook his head.

“Right and wrong, how can there be true right and wrong?”

Qin Yu didn’t say anything and didn’t say anything more.

For the rest of the time, Qin Yu stayed in the private room, waiting for Zheng Ke’s arrival.

At night, Zheng Ke called Qin Yu.

He said on the phone, “At 11 pm, I’ll wait for you at the Jingdu Martial Arts Association. You have to think of a way to bring us in.”

“Okay.”Qin Yu answered and hung up the phone.

Then, he took out his phone and called Xia Hang.

“Tonight, I’m going to enter the Jingdu Martial Arts Association and bring a friend with me,”Qin Yu said.

Xia Hang, who was on the other end, was shocked. He frowned and said, “Qin Yu, are you crazy? The Jingdu martial arts association is heavily guarded, and your identity is very special. How can I bring you in?”

“You think of a way,”Qin Yu said coldly.

“Xia Hang, you have to help me think of a way for this matter no matter what, because... This is very important to me.”

Hearing Qin Yu’s cautious tone, Xia hang could not help but frown.

“But... if Granny Qin finds out, it will be troublesome,”Xia Hang said with a frown.

Qin Yu was silent for a moment, and then said, “I will think of a way to distract Granny Qin.”

“Okay.”Hearing this, Xia hang finally agreed.

In the current Jingdu Martial Arts Association, Xia Hang was not afraid of anyone except Granny Qin.

After hanging up the phone, Qin Yu closed his eyes slightly and waited for time.

He turned around and walked in front of little black, and said in a low voice, “Do you want Granny Qin to Die?”

Hearing this, Little Black’s face suddenly changed!

He glared at Qin Yu and said, “If you dare to hurt Granny Qin, I will definitely kill you! !”

“Granny Qin treats you as her son. I think you have already treated Granny Qin as your mother,”Qin Yu said in a low voice.

Blacky snorted and said, “What exactly are you trying to say?”

Qin Yu said, “If you don’t want Granny Qin to die, tell me where I can find the Panacea.”

“Of course, you can choose not to tell me, but I will kill Granny Qin if you do.”Qin Yu’s voice suddenly became extremely cold.

A hint of hesitation flashed across Blackie’s face. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

He didn’t want to tell Qin Yu at all, but if something happened to Granny Qin, it would be worse than death for him.

“You can go to the three-island sea to have a look,”Blackie said reluctantly.

Qin Yu patted Little Black’s head and said, “Okay.”

After saying this, Qin Yu found the handlebar mustache again.

He walked out of the house with the handlebar mustache and then said, “Tonight, you have to help me do something.”

The handlebar mustache frowned and said, “What is it?”

Qin Yu said in a deep voice, “Tonight at ten o’clock, you take little black to the suburbs of Jingdu and give it to Granny Qin.”

“Remember, you must think of a way to stall for time. The longer the better,”Qin Yu reminded.

The mustached man scratched his head and said, “Why?”

“No need to ask,”Qin Yu said.

After explaining everything, Qin Yu let out a long sigh of relief.

He couldn’t help but take out a cigarette and put it in his mouth.

“I’ve finally waited for this day,”Qin Yu muttered in a low voice.

Little Black, Granny Qin, and the Hong family all played their respective roles.

Qin Yu’s plan could also be implemented.

At nine o’clock in the evening.

Handlebar mustache left the house early with little black and headed to a place called Yan City on the outskirts of Jingdu.

At ten o’clock in the evening, Qin Yu took out his phone and called Granny Qin.

The call was quickly picked up. Qin Yu went straight to the point, “Granny Qin, do you still want to see Blackie?”

Hearing this, Granny Qin’s voice immediately sounded somewhat anxious.

“What do you want!”Granny Qin asked anxiously.

Qin Yu smiled and said, “Don’t be afraid. I have good news for you. If you still want to see Blackie, go to Jingdu at 11 o’clock tonight. There will be someone waiting for you there.”

“Yan City?”Granny Qin’s pupils constricted. She said in a cold and helpless voice, “Qin Yu, are you lying to me?”

“Believe it or not, it’s up to you,”Qin Yu said.

After saying this, Qin Yu directly hung up the phone without any hesitation.

Granny Qin quickly called Qin Yu back, but Qin Yu didn’t pick up.

Because Qin Yu wanted to create anxiety for Granny Qin and force her to go to Yan City as soon as possible.

Everything was as Qin Yu expected. After the phone call, Granny Qin hurried to Yan City.

11 o’clock at night.

Qin Yu appeared in Yan City on time.

On his head, he was still wearing the hat given by Granny Qin.

Zheng Ke also appeared in the vicinity ahead of time.

After seeing Qin Yu, Zheng Ke walked over quickly.

“Have you arranged everything?”Zheng Ke asked coldly.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “En, as long as nothing happens to you.”

As he spoke, Qin Yu quietly released his spiritual sense and scanned the surroundings.

After sensing the weak internal Qi in the surroundings, the corners of Qin Yu’s mouth couldn’t help but curl up into a cold smile.

At this moment, Xia Hang walked out from the Jingdu Martial Arts Association.

Qin Yu quickly walked forward when he saw Xia Hang.

“Qin Yu, who is this person?”A trace of panic flashed across Xia Hang’s face when he saw Zheng Ke beside Qin Yu.

Qin Yu glanced at Zheng Ke and said indifferently, “Don’t worry, he won’t leak the news.”
