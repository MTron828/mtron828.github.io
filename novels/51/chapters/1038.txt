Chapter 1039: Chapter 1,039, return the favor

He was obviously exhausted, yet he wanted to shout loudly.

This was clearly a warning to the surrounding crowd to disperse as soon as possible!

Thinking of this, Jiang he’s expression became even more unsightly.

Qin Yu also realized that something was wrong, but in the midst of a great battle, how could he be distracted to think carefully!

He only knew that the soul bell was one of the top spiritual artifacts in the second mystic realm, and its power was endless!

“Humans and animals are indistinguishable...”Qin Yu’s expression was a little ugly.

He looked around and shouted, “Hurry up and retreat!”

“It’s useless. The coverage of the soul bell is extremely wide. How far can they retreat?”Zhai Xing looked at Qin Yu coldly and said.

Qin Yu’s face was full of frost as he shouted, “Zhai Xing, why do so many people have to be involved in the grudge between us? !”

“I can’t care about that!”Zhai Xing said angrily.

“I only know that I want to serve the second secret realm!”

After saying that, he held the soul bell in his hand and slowly swung it!

“I won’t let you have your way!”Qin Yu was furious. He executed the ‘xing’character and stepped forward in an attempt to snatch the soul bell from Zhai Xing’s hand!

However, Zhai Xing had already taken precautions. He shifted his position and retreated. His body appeared in midair in an instant!

“Once the soul bell is activated, the top-tier will sweep through all directions. Humans and animals will be indistinguishable! Qin Yu, you can’t save anyone!”Zhai Xing said coldly.

Even though he said so, the Soul Bell had not been activated for a long time!

The surrounding crowd walked further and further away. Jiang he originally wanted to advise him, but in the end, he sighed slightly.

He understood Zhai Xing too well.

He was a combination of contradiction and stubbornness.

He had good intentions, but he was also stubborn to serve the second mystic realm.

The best ending for Star Seizer was to die in battle for the Second Mystic Realm.

Jiang he let out a long sigh, turned around, and left.

The crowd grew further and further away. The Soul Bell in Star Seizer’s hand also began to emit strands of heavy and extremely strange aura.

That Aura hung down from the Soul Bell, and the Soul Bell also became incomparably large in an instant! The internal Qi of the Soul Bell also became incomparably large!

Just the instant it was activated, Qin Yu felt a strong sense of oppression!

It was as if thousands of Great Dao had instantly landed on his body!

“Qin Yu, today you will die without a doubt!”Zhai Xing said coldly.

Qin Yu’s expression was solemn. He revealed his saintly body technique and did not dare to hide any more trump cards.

At the same time, Qin Yu clenched his fists. He planned to rely on one punch to break ten thousand techniques to resist this soul bell!

“Rumble...”

There seemed to be a great dao rumbling within the soul bell, shaking the world.

Zhai Xing held the Soul Bell with his hand, as if a God had descended!

“Die!”

Accompanied by Zhai Xing’s furious roar, he raised his hand and slammed it fiercely onto the soul bell!

“Dang!”

Waves of extremely tyrannical internal Qi swept towards Qin Yu like sound waves!

Qin Yu’s body was directly pushed back from a great distance!

He did not dare to be negligent and raised his hand to break all the internal Qi!

Internal Qi surged onto his right fist, and golden light erupted from his fist like a Jet!

“Boom!”

The sound shook the sky, and the Great Dao rumbled. It was as if even the void was about to be shattered!

The internal Qi emitted by the soul bell penetrated his body and instantly pushed him back more than a hundred meters!

The layer of skin on his body seemed to have been burned off! The residual power emitted by the soul bell was still spreading in all directions!

Qin Yu couldn’t care less about the pain in his body. He shouted and jumped up from the ground. His fists moved quickly and threw out golden seals!

The Soul Bell in Zhai Xing’s hand didn’t hit him a second time!

Qin Yu’s golden seal hit Zhai Xing’s body hard, and his body was instantly slammed into the ground!

Under this palm strike, Zhai Xing was severely injured and his internal Qi was weak!

He quickly put away the soul bell as if he was afraid that the Soul Bell would fall into Qin Yu’s hands!

Qin Yu was afraid that Zhai Xing would activate the soul bell again. He did not dare to waste any more time and quickly rushed towards Zhai Xing. He raised his hand and summoned the five mountains, pressing down on Zhai Xing’s body!

Zhai Xing wanted to get up, but the five mountains weighed thousands of kilograms. No matter how much he struggled, he did not move an inch!

Qin Yu looked at Zhai Xing and said in a deep voice, “Zhai Xing, why did you activate the Soul Bell?”

Zhai Xing said fiercely, “Kill me if you have the ability!”

Qin Yu was speechless.

He could not figure out why Zhai Xing was so excited.

“If you don’t kill me, I will definitely kill you!”Zhai Xing’s eyes were wide open and bloodshot!

Qin Yu was silent for a long time. Finally, he put away the mountain of the five peaks.

“You have let me go twice. I will let you go this time,”Qin Yu said.

“Hurry up and leave. If you are a wise person, don’t return to the second mystic realm.”

With that, Qin Yu turned around and planned to leave.

“This is already the second time!”

However, at this moment, Zhai Xing used his internal Qi to charge at Qin Yu again!

Qin Yu turned around and slapped Zhai Xing away again!

“Why did you do this!”Qin Yu said angrily!

Zhai Xing spat out blood and said coldly, “Cut the crap. You have already returned my favor... no matter what, I will kill you!”

He struggled to get up and staggered towards Qin Yu!

Qin Yu stood there motionlessly.

With Zhai Xing’s current state, he was no longer a threat to him.

With great difficulty, he walked in front of Qin Yu, raised his palm, and slapped it towards Qin Yu.

However, that palm had already lost its strength, so how could it injure Qin Yu’s steel body?

Zhai Xing’s hand landed on Qin Yu’s chest, and then fell straight down.

He fell to the ground and did not get up again. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Looking at Zhai Xing who was covered in blood, Qin Yu could not help but feel a bit of pity in his heart.

He sighed and turned around to leave.

However, after taking a few steps, he returned to Zhai Xing’s side.

“I don’t believe that you are a cruel person.”Qin Yu carried Zhai Xing on his back and then strode towards the Heaven Gate.

Countless people had gathered in the Heaven Gate.

There were disciples of the Heaven Gate as well as martial artists who had come to watch the battle.

They were all waiting, waiting for the result of this battle.

“Qin Yu is back!”

At this moment, someone shouted and everyone hurriedly looked over.

Jiang he, who had his eyes closed, opened his eyes in an instant.

Qin Yu carried Zhai Xing on his back and walked back step by step.
