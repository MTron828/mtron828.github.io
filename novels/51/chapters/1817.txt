1818 He Is Shi Shiyue

The Si family’s war chariot was awe-inspiring. It exuded an ancient internal qi that caused people to have the urge to prostrate in worship.

Qin Yu raised his head and stared at the chariot. He couldn’t help but have a trace of killing intent in his heart.

Even though Qin Yu tried to restrain himself with all his might, it was hard for him to tolerate it.

Soon, the chariot stopped, and powerful figures stepped down one after another.

These people seemed to be the elders of the Si family. They looked quite benevolent but their every act and move made people not dare to offend them.

Soon, a rather handsome young man walked down from the chariot.

He looked cold and arrogant, and his conceited temperament made people not dare to look into his eyes.

This person was the famous Si Shiyue. He was the most talented young man in the Si family and one of the most powerful geniuses in the entire Holy Region!

Qin Yu’s gaze was fixed on him as if he was trying to memorize his face.

Under everyone’s gaze, Si Shiyue slowly walked down from the war chariot. No one dared to come forward to talk to him due to his conceited temperament.

One could clearly sense a tremendously powerful internal qi on his body.

This internal qi was perfect by nature, and it seemed that everything he could see would bow to him.

“Si Shiyue…” Qin Yu clenched his fists and remembered him by heart.

“Mr. Si’s internal qi seems to have been stronger than before,” someone sighed with emotion and said.

“That’s right! His talent is among the best even in the entire history.”

“If he continues to grow in this manner, he will definitely enter the Tribulation Transcending Stage. He might even have the chance to become an emperor.

While the others were talking among themselves, Qin Yu was hiding in the dark, looking at Si Shiyue coldly with a dark face.

Si Shiyue walked past the crowd and headed toward Yan Ruoxue.

He walked all the way to Ruoxue’s side and bowed slightly, ” “Ruoxue, are you representing the Yan family?”

Yan Ruoxue shook her head and said, “No, Uncle Yan is in charge. It has nothing to do with me.”

Si Shiyue’s brows furrowed a little as if he was slightly surprised.

Uncle Yan, who was by the side, was stunned too. However, he did not deny it. Instead, he nodded and said, “Shiyue, Ruoxue is still young. She doesn’t want to be involved in this matter for the time being.”

“Uncle Yan,” Si Shiyue greeted Uncle Ya. He then said, “It’s fine. This event is just a display to the public and also to show the power of our families.”

As Si Shiyue said, the Si family placed great importance on this event.

They had mobilized the ancient war chariot and brought Saint Weapons along.

Besides this, a True Saint was also following Si Shiyue.

Such power was enough to sweep away most of the families in the Holy Region.

Following that, Si Shiyue walked forward. He came to an immortal platform and sat down. His posture was incomparably proud, like a newly ascended king enjoying the worship of everyone.

Compared to Si Shiyue, Yan Ruoxue was much more peaceful. She had a faint smile on her face and was natural and gracious.

Qin Yu was still looking at Si Shiyue coldly. He had deeply engraved Si Shiyue’s face in his mind.

He was the powerful chaotic body, Qin Yu’s love rival!

Urged by such feelings, Qin Yu could no longer hold back the killing intent in his heart.

He knew that if this continued, Si Shiyue would surely notice.

“I can only leave for now.” Qin Yu gritted his teeth and looked at Yan Ruoxue again.

Although he was reluctant to leave, Qin Yu knew he would get into trouble if he stayed longer. Thus he had to leave for now.

Si Shiyue had left an extremely deep impression on Qin Yu. His powerful internal qi was the most terrifying among all the young people Qin Yu had seen thus far.

This invisible pressure made Qin Yu even more anxious.

Qin Yu quickly got up and walked toward the exit of the grand event.

Just as Qin Yu stood up and was about to leave, Yan Ruoxue once again noticed this “strange person”.

“This person…” Yan Ruoxue frowned slightly.

She always felt that this person very much resemble Qin Yu. That lean back gave Yan Ruoxue a unique feeling.

She could only feel this from Qin Yu.

“Could it be him?” Yan Ruoxue couldn’t help but stand up and stare in Qin Yu’s direction.

“Miss Yan, what’s wrong?” Uncle Yan asked softly.

Yan Ruoxue pulled Uncle Yan to the side and said, “Uncle Yan, I… I want to go out for a while.”

“Going out for a while? Miss Yan, if you leave on occasion like today, isn’t it putting the Si family in an awkward position?” Uncle Yan said with a frown.

Yan Ruoxue pulled on Uncle Yan’s arm and said coquettishly, “Uncle Yan, I have an emergency. I believe you can help me think of a reasonable reason. Please, please!”

Uncle Yan smiled bitterly, sighed, and said, “You almost caused trouble when you left the Yan family last time. This time…”

“One last time. I promise this will be the last time!” Yan Ruoxue begged and said. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Uncle Yan seemed to be at a loss and could only sigh and say, “Alright. I’ll get someone to follow you to prevent anything untoward.”

“No! No! No! I don’t need it. I have this.” Yan Ruoxue hurriedly shook her head. With a flip of her palm, she took out a jade mirror.

The jade mirror had an extraordinary origin. It was a top Saint Weapon passed down from the Yan family’s ancestors.

Uncle Yan had no choice but to nod and say, “Alright. Please be careful and come back early.

“Sure!” Yan Ruoxue hurriedly nodded.

After saying this, she quietly walked toward the exit.

After leaving the grand event, Yan Ruoxue gently stepped on the ground and a green lotus appeared under her feet.

This green lotus was also a top-notch magical artifact of the Yan family. It had extremely fast speed and Yan Ruoxue found Qin Yu’s figure in almost an instant.

At this moment, Qin Yu was slowly walking down the stairs.

The internal qi on his body was terribly cold, and his mind was full of Si Shiyue’s arrogant expression.

Qin Yu wished he could stomp on his stinky face.

However, his powerful internal qi had given Qin Yu unprecedented pressure.

This kind of pressure really caused some pain to Qin Yu.

Just then, a figure landed in front of Qin Yu.

A blinding light flashed in the surroundings like a barrier, separating the two of them from the space in the surroundings.

“Qin Yu, you… you actually came to the Holy Region!” Looking at the dejected and angry Qin Yu in front of her, Yan Ruoxue seemed to have guessed something.

Compared to Yan Ruoxue’s surprise, Qin Yu seemed to be at a loss.

He quickly said, “Ruoxue, I… I came here secretly. I’ll leave now. Don’t worry. No one will find me. I won’t cause you any trouble…”

Yan Ruoxue was stunned. She walked forward and placed her gentle hand on Qin Yu’s head. The scene was the same as in the past.

“Silly! What are you saying? What trouble can you cause me?” Yan Ruoxue smiled gently.
