Chapter 1359: Chapter 1359, I have someone in my heart 

Hearing Li Yingying’s words, Qin Yu’s interest was finally piqued.

When he was on Earth, Qin Yu had heard many legends about masked women.

Especially handlebar mustaches, iron egg, and the others. They were all extremely wary of masked women.

Now that he had come to the holy region, this was the first time Qin Yu had heard news about masked women.

“You know about the masked woman?”Qin Yu asked with a frown.

Seeing that she had changed the topic, Li Yingying also smiled.

She said with a faint smile, “Of course I know. Who among the holy region cultivators doesn’t know about the rumors about her?”

“What rumors?”Qin Yu asked with some doubts.

Li Yingying said, “About five thousand years ago, she killed dozens of holy region cultivators who were at the crossing Calamity Stage.”

Qin Yu was silent.

It seemed that the rumor that Li Yingying and the others had received was another life of the masked woman.

The masked woman had reincarnated many times, but only her first life and the one 5,000 years ago had truly grown up.

Other than that, every time she reincarnated, it was almost always the time when the Golden Age arrived.

“Who ended up with that hairpin?”Qin Yu asked.

Li Yingying smiled faintly and said, “Of course it’s the nine great families. Other than them, who else could have such luck?”

Qin Yu didn’t say anything more. They probably didn’t know that the masked woman had been reborn. She was the little fish of this life.

Without a doubt, she would definitely take back all the things that belonged to her. Having her treasures wasn’t necessarily a good thing.

“Brother Qin seems to be quite interested in this matter?”Li Yingying asked tentatively.

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “I’m just asking.”

Then, Qin Yu ignored Li Yingying.

Li Yingying tried to find a topic many times, but Qin Yu’s response was extremely cold.

This made Li Yingying feel a little unhappy.

At noon, Wen Da went to find a restaurant.

While Big Wen went to the bathroom, Li yingying frowned and said, “Brother Qin seems to be avoiding me?”

Qin Yu glanced at Li Yingying and said, “I didn’t want to say anything. Since you brought it up, I’ll tell you straight to the point.”

“I’m not interested in you at all, and I don’t like you using Big Wen. This will only make me disgusted. So, I advise you to stop doing useless things.”

An embarrassed look appeared on Li Yingying’s face. She was silent for a moment before saying, “Brother Qin, I can’t think clearly. You and I can be considered a match made in heaven. If we can become partners, it will definitely become a good story.”

“The reason you are avoiding me, could it be because of Big Wen? Just because he is your friend, do you have to suppress your heart and take your happiness with you?”

Hearing Li Yingying’s words, Qin Yu almost vomited.

He was speechless in his heart. Li Yingying’s confidence really gave him a headache.

“You think too much. I simply don’t like you. It has nothing to do with Wen Da,”Qin Yu said quietly.

“I already have someone in my heart, so don’t waste your energy.”

Li Yingying suddenly asked with some excitement, “Someone? Who Is It? How many girls in the entire South Province can be compared to me!”

Qin Yu glanced at her and said, “You don’t need to know.”

Li Yingying bit her lips and said, “I must know! Otherwise, I won’t be satisfied!”

Qin Yu looked at Li Yingying coldly and said, “Well, since you must know, I’ll tell you.”

“The person I like is the princess of the Yan family in the Central Province. The two of US have already made a secret promise for the rest of our lives.”

“I will not marry anyone but her. She will not marry anyone but me. Other than her, I will not fall in love with any other woman.”

“Li Yingying, I admit that you are somewhat beautiful. You are considered a heaven’s favorite in the Southern Plains. However, do you think that you are qualified to compete with the Princess of the Yan Family?”

After hearing Qin Yu’s words, Li Yingying did not get angry. Instead, she smiled. There was even a trace of ridicule on her face.

She sneered and said, “The Princess of the Yan Family? Qin Yu, I’m not worthy to be compared with her. Are You Worthy? Aren’t you too good at bragging?”

“You are indeed a genius in the South Province, but aren’t you a little too arrogant to actually covet the Princess of the Yan Family? When you talk about me, don’t you consider your own conditions?”

Qin Yu opened his mouth. He knew that Li Yingying wouldn’t believe him, so he was too lazy to explain.

“If you want to reject me, you don’t need to find such a ridiculous excuse.”Li Yingying shook her head.

She sat down as if she was trying to calm her emotions.

A few minutes later, Li Yingying said faintly, “Qin Yu, ever since I was young, there is nothing that I, Li Yingying, can not get, including you.”

“Sick.”A hint of annoyance flashed across Qin Yu’s brows.

“What are you guys talking about?”

At this moment, Wen Da and Wen er walked back from the toilet.

“Nothing much. We’re just chatting.”Li Yingying said with a faint smile.

Qin Yu didn’t say anything, but he made up his mind in his heart.

No matter what, he had to persuade Wen da to let go. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

The dishes were quickly served. Just as the few of them were about to eat, a white-faced scholar suddenly appeared outside the door.

This person had a graceful bearing. He was dressed in white and looked like a young master from a wealthy family.

His motive was also very obvious. As soon as he entered the door, he went straight for Qin Yu.
