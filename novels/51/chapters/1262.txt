Chapter 1263: Chapter 1,263 will be snatched away by you in a moment 

The Heavenly Cloud sect sent out a protector, but he was almost killed. This undoubtedly brought shame to the entire Heavenly Cloud sect.

They controlled the sovereignty of most of the cities in the South Province. If their prestige was lowered, it meant that someone would challenge their position.

Therefore, the heavenly cloud sect had to think of a way to get rid of Qin Yu as soon as possible and regain their lost face.

On the other side, Qin Yu had already escaped far away.

Fortunately, he had money on him now, so he bought a new set of clothes for himself and covered his whole body.

Qin Yu’s body did not have any spiritual power fluctuations, so it was not easy to find him. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

He found a place to stay for the time being, and only when he entered the guest room did he take off his heavy clothes.

“Tianyun sect...”Qin Yu muttered softly.

This time, the Guardian did not surprise Qin Yu too much.

It was not an exaggeration to say that if he gave it his all, guardian Ren would not be a match for Qin Yu at all.

As long as Qin Yu used the battle word formula, killing him would be effortless.

However, it was impossible for Qin Yu to resist the entire Tianyun sect by himself.

After thinking about it, he still had to find a place to stay.

Most of the people who came to the holy region through the ancient array platforms had guides, so they could have a general understanding of the Holy Region.

However, the relationship between Qin Yu and the Heavenly Cloud sect was broken, so he had no way to understand the holy region.

I still have to find a place to stay, Qin Yu thought in a low voice.

Relying on his own exploration, he didn’t know when he would be able to gain some understanding of the holy region.

If he wanted to find life, it would probably take even longer.

Thus, Qin Yu took out the map of Li Prefecture and began to study it carefully.

Li Prefecture had a total of five major sectors, and these five major sectors were basically guarded by top sects.

Just like the Southern Prefecture, the Tianyun sect was basically the most respected.

Other than the Tianyun sect, there were also numerous sects and cities of all sizes.

However, these sects were basically useless and were far from the Tianyun sect.

“Now that I’ve offended the Tianyun sect, I’m afraid no one will dare to take me in,”Qin Yu thought to himself.

He originally wanted to hide his identity and find a random sect to investigate the situation. However, after thinking about it, he eventually gave up on this idea.

With the Heavenly Cloud Sect’s ability, finding Qin Yu wasn’t a difficult matter. If he was discovered, it would probably implicate others.

“With my current situation, there seems to be only one place I can go.”Qin Yu stared at the map and said in a low voice.

That place was the green rock forest.

In the Green Rock Forest, there was a special occupation, that was hunters. They killed demonic beasts for money to make a living.

This was an extremely large organization. Almost all of the hunters had some ability.

And they also had a common trait. They were unwilling to listen to others, and they were even more unwilling to join any sect. They liked to travel alone. Slowly, these people gathered together and formed a unique force.

Even a huge figure like the heavenly cloud sect was unwilling to offend these hunters.

“It’s him.”Qin Yu pointed at the location of the border of the southern province on the map and said in a low voice.

This was extremely suitable for Qin Yu. Not only could he gather information related to vitality, but he could also guarantee his safety and freedom.

More importantly, by slaughtering these demon beasts, he might be able to obtain some supreme cultivation treasures from them.

He did as he was told. The next day, Qin Yu rushed towards the hunter organization according to the location on the map.

The hunter organization was located at the borders of the Southern Prefecture. The distance between them was much greater than Qin Yu had imagined.

From the map, they were only a few thousand stars away. However, after traveling for a day, Qin Yu was still extremely far away from the hunter organization.

“Damn, this is too tiring.”Qin Yu couldn’t help but curse to himself.

A saint-level combatant was much larger than Qin Yu had imagined. It was simply too difficult to traverse with just human strength.

He raised his head and looked at the sky. There were high officials and nobles riding auspicious beasts as they galloped through the sky.

Those who were slightly inferior could also ride on colorful glazed horses and gallop on the road.

“It seems that I still have to snatch a Flying Demon Beast,”Qin Yu thought to himself.

Thus, he found a restaurant and quietly waited for an opportunity.

While he was waiting, someone beside him suddenly whispered, “Have you heard? A guardian of the Heavenly Cloud sect was almost killed!”

“Mm, I’ve heard a bit. I heard that it was an outsider who had just arrived at the holy region. He beat Protector Ren until he abandoned his body and fled in a sorry state.”

“Your news is too outdated.”At this moment, someone beside him interrupted.

“According to the latest news I’ve received, the Heavenly Cloud sect has already dispatched three protectors. They’re preparing to kill that Kid.”

“Three protectors?”

“Mm, rumor has it that these three protectors have already reached the late-stage of the Almighty Realm, and are considered outstanding in the entire Southern Province.”

“TSK tsk, three late-stage of the Almighty Realm. I’m really looking forward to it.”

“Those three protectors are nothing.”Another person interrupted.

“Do you know who is leading the team?”

“Who? Could it be the great protector? Or the first elder? It Can’t be the sect leader, right?”

“Wrong, all wrong! The one leading this team is the young sect master of the Heavenly Cloud Sect!”

“The young sect master of the Heavenly Cloud Sect? That youth who is known as the number one genius of the Southern Region?”

“That’s right, it’s him. Rumor has it that this young sect master is only eighteen years old, but he has already stepped into the middle stage of the Almighty Realm. Rumor has it that even the late stage of the Almighty realm might not be able to defeat him!”

Qin Yu sat at the side, quietly listening to their comments.

Young sect master?

Has This Heavenly Cloud Sect Gone Mad? Aren’t they afraid of Qin Yu slapping their young sect master to death with a single slap?

“The number one genius of the South Province... interesting.”Qin Yu rubbed his chin and muttered softly.

Just as he was thinking, a strange beast that was flickering with light in the sky flapped its wings and descended.

That huge wing blotted out the sky and covered the sun, causing the originally bright restaurant to instantly turn gray.

The exotic beast landed on one side of the restaurant, and then a man dressed in expensive clothes walked down.

This person was full of internal Qi, and his aura was extremely extraordinary. One look and one could tell that he wasn’t from an ordinary family.

“Lord Meng is here.”Seeing this middle-aged man, the people in the restaurant stood up one after another and greeted Lord Meng.

Qin Yu’s eyes, however, had been staring at the exotic beast at the door.

The exotic beast was locked by a golden glass lock. It stood there quietly, looking rather dazzling.

Lord Meng seemed to have noticed Qin Yu’s gaze. He walked directly to Qin Yu and said with a faint smile, “Do you like it?”

Qin Yu was startled, and he hurriedly lowered his head and said, “I like it very much. It’s very beautiful. Do you want to give it to me?”

“Give it to you? No, no, no, you’ve misunderstood. I’m just here to show off. This exotic beast is called the seven-colored divine Phoenix, but it can travel a hundred stars a day. I spent a whole 100,000 spirit energy to buy it,”said Lord Meng proudly.

After saying that, he even sized up Qin Yu, and then said even more proudly, “Let me tell you this. With your looks, I reckon you won’t be able to afford it in ten lifetimes. hahaha!”

Qin Yu couldn’t help but snort softly in his heart.

Keep showing off. I’ll snatch it for you later.
