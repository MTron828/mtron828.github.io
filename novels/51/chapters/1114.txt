Chapter 1115: Chapter 1,115, the Agonized Yan Jinyao 

Qin Yu leaped and landed on the shore.

“I’m finally back,”Qin Yu said softly.

Time was tight at the moment, so Qin Yu did not waste any time. He immediately set off and headed straight for the Divine Alchemist Pavilion.

After spending several hours, Qin Yu finally arrived at the Divine Alchemist Pavilion in the evening of the same day.

He quickly arrived at the pavilion master’s Building and found the pavilion master.

“Pavilion Master.”Qin Yu bowed slightly to the pavilion master.

Pavilion master said with slight surprise, “Aren’t you on Cloud Dragon Island? Why are you here?”

Qin Yu gave a wry smile and told the pavilion master what had happened.

After hearing this, pavilion master couldn’t help but be dumbfounded. His small mouth was slightly open as he looked at Qin Yu in astonishment.

“You... deceived a mighty figure and took away the strange flower?”Pavilion master’s voice was filled with shock.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “That’s right. I was also forced to do so.”

“Qin Yu, you really are...”pavilion master did not know how to describe it for a moment.

“How audacious. Is there anything in this world that you don’t dare to do?”Pavilion master helplessly shook his head and said.

Qin Yu smiled bitterly and said, “If I don’t leave, he will also kill me.”

“Then you have snatched the strange flower. When he comes into the world, he will definitely not let you off,”pavilion master said.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “Therefore, I must step into the intermediate stage of the Martial Saint Realm before he comes into the world. Otherwise, I will die without a doubt.”

When he said this, Qin Yu took out the strange flower from the spatial divine weapon.

Nearly a hundred strange flowers landed in the pavilion master’s building.

Looking at this strange flower that was flickering with light, pavilion master was even more shocked.

“So many strange flowers, I’ve... really never seen it before,”pavilion master said in shock.

Qin Yu said, “Pavilion Master, I’m afraid I’ll need to trouble you to help me refine the heaven origin pill.”

“In ten days, you can refine as many as you want. The rest of the strange flowers will be given to you.”

Pavilion master shook her head and said, “That’s not necessary. Even if you don’t have enough time, you can still choose to swallow the rest of the strange flowers.”

“No, I must give you this strange flower,”Qin Yu said.

“The opening of the holy region is an extremely stressful thing for everyone. You also need to improve your strength.”

“Besides, I only want to enter the intermediate stage of the Martial Saint Realm. As long as I survive this tribulation, I won’t need to worry about cultivation resources.”

Upon seeing this, the pavilion master did not insist any further.

She immediately asked the medicine boy beside her to find Xiang Danqing.

When Xiang Danqing saw so many strange flowers, his attitude was similar to the pavilion master’s. He could not believe his own eyes.

Qin Yu had no choice but to recount the matter once more.

“Alright, time is of the essence. Don’t waste any more time.”The pavilion master looked at Xiang Danqing and said.

Qin Yu cupped his hands and said, “Thank you for your help, Seniors.”

Following that, pavilion master found a relatively safe spot in the Divine Alchemist Pavilion and the three of them began to refine the heavenly yuan pills.

This time, the three of them would be in closed-door cultivation for a full ten days. Refining pills continuously for ten days was an extremely exhausting task for anyone with divine sense.

However, pavilion master did not have any complaints about this.

In the next few days, pill clouds would occasionally rise in the sky of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion, indicating the arrival of one heavenly yuan pill after another.

And in the outside world, the news of the opening of the holy region was getting fiercer and fiercer.

From time to time, strange movements could be heard from the second secret realm. Internal Qi was slowly flowing out of the gap.

Zhai Xing stood near the gap and said in a deep voice, “At this rate, I’m afraid we won’t be able to hold on for long.”

The eight higher-ups were the true controllers of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association.

Even Zhai Xing couldn’t help but feel a little worried.

He couldn’t even muster the will to resist when facing a mighty figure.

“I really don’t know how Qin Yu will deal with this.”Zhai Xing sighed slightly. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Other than Qin Yu, Yao Meng and the others also chose to enter seclusion.

They had the heaven origin pill personally refined by the pavilion master, so their strength had also increased.

At this moment, in the Yan family manor, Yan Jinyao’s injuries had basically recovered.

However, his cultivation had already been crippled by Qin Yu. Even if he were to cultivate with all his might, his strength would not be able to advance by even a single bit.

“Ah! ! !”

The cries of collapse spread throughout the entire Yan family manor!

The news of the opening of the holy region continuously entered his ears.

Even if he intentionally wanted to avoid it, he was still unable to stay out of it.

“I’m not reconciled, I’m not reconciled!”Yan Jinyao half-knelt on the ground, two lines of clear tears flowing out of his eyes.

Yan Sihai slowly walked over from not far away.

Seeing Yan Jinyao’s deep and painful feelings, his heart felt like it was being cut by a knife.

“Forget it, there’s nothing wrong with being an ordinary person. Inherit the Yan family’s property and walk the business route, we can still live well,”Yan Sihai comforted.

Yan Jinyao suddenly raised his head and said in pain, “No, I will never accept it. I will never accept it! I am the number one person in the younger generation. How could I have fallen to this? I will never accept it...”

As he said that, Yan Jinyao’s tears gushed out again.

“Qin Yu, it’s all your fault. You ruined my life. Sob, sob, sob...”Yan Jinyao knelt on the ground with tears streaming down his face.

Seeing this, Yan Sihai couldn’t help but clench his teeth.

He squatted down beside Yan Jinyao and said in a low voice, “Son, I will definitely think of a way. No matter what price I have to pay, I will definitely let you recover your strength. I will!”

Yan Jinyao slumped to the ground and said feebly, “It’s useless. Even the Pavilion Master of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion can’t do it. No one can help me...”

“Not necessarily,”Yan Sihai said in a deep voice.

“The Pavilion Master of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion does represent the top alchemists of the current era. But after the opening of the Holy Region, she’s nothing.”

“When that time comes, there will definitely be a way. Definitely!”

Hearing these words, Yan Jinyao seemed to have a glimmer of hope.

He suddenly stood up and kept murmuring, “Yes, the Holy Region. After the holy region opens, there’s still hope! Dad, you must help me. You must help me!”

“Even if I have to sell everything I have, I will make you recover!”Yan Sihai said gloomily.
