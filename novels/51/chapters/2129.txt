2130 Following the Warship

He could feel that with every step forward, the density of the dao technique was increasing.

Walking on the busy street, the crowd around him surged. Qin Yu seemed not to hear their shouts and noises and fully focused on feeling the guidance of the dao technique.

The dao technique was like a clear road sign, allowing Qin Yu to quickly find the direction where the day of the Path of Heaven arrived. He rushed in that direction quickly, his footsteps getting increasingly faster.

On this path, there were people like Qin Yu, relying on sensing the dao technique to find where the day of the Path of Heaven would arrive. Some people chose to follow behind others to reach the destination, but most of them were running around like headless flies, searching everywhere in a daze.

The growth rate of the dao technique was tremendously slow, indicating that it was an incredibly long distance. If he wanted to reach his destination, he would probably need a very long time.

At that moment, some people were moving quickly into the void. They seemed to have a special method to find the location of the day of the Path of Heaven.

Immediately after, carriages sped past in the sky. It seemed to be the carriages of the nine great aristocratic families. Their speed was tremendously fast. In the blink of an eye, they disappeared without a trace.

Numerous people looked up at the sky with envy in their eyes.

“Sigh! These aristocratic families have gotten hold of the news. I’m afraid they will arrive much earlier than us.”

“Yes, when they arrive, I’m afraid they’ll completely seal off the area. We won’t have a chance.”

“That won’t happen. On the day of the Path of Heaven, no aristocratic family can seal. It’s just that we’ll be much slower than them.”

Everyone was envious, but Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and sneered.

His internal qi skyrocketed, and golden light permeated his body. In the next second, Qin Yu’s feet trembled violently as he quickly chased after the carriages!

As long as he followed the carriages, Qin Yu would no longer need to deduce the dao technique and could arrive at the first moment!

No one knew how long the day of the Path of Heaven would last, but the central area of its arrival was definitely an excellent place to comprehend dao. Qin Yu absolutely could not miss it.

Stepping on the line word formula and possessing the Traceless Secret Technique, Qin Yu’s speed was tremendously fast, and even the carriages could not shake him off.

His body was shimmering with golden light, and a powerful internal qi almost caused the surrounding air to tremble.

As Qin Yu’s speed increased, he rushed forward like a shooting star. His speed was so fast that no one could catch a glimpse of his figure. Only a golden track of light was left behind, cutting through the sky and heading straight for the carriages.

In the sky, golden light intertwined with the traces left behind by carriages as if they were performing a magnificent chase. Their speed caused the air around to generate a screechy sound as if the air was being torn.

The golden light on Qin Yu’s body grew increasingly intense, and his speed increased too. In the end, he caught up to those carriages in one breath, following closely behind them.

When Qin Yu got closer, he finally saw the origin of the carriages.

“The Ni family,” Qin Yu slightly narrowed his eyes and could not help but mutter. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Qin Yu had no enmity with the Ni Family, nor had there been any disputes. However, Qin Yu understood that all the nine great aristocratic families were similar. They must have eyed the Traceless Immortal Scripture on him. Therefore, he did not dare to let down his guard and maintained a distance with them that was neither too far nor too close.

Even so, the people on the Ni family’s warship still soon discovered Qin Yu’s tracks.

An elderly man placed his hands behind his back, looked in Qin Yu’s direction, and slowly said, “Who is that person following our warship? He’s so fast?”

Hearing this, two armored soldiers immediately walked forward and cupped their hands. “First Elder, we will go and check it out now.”

The elderly man was silent and only looked in Qin Yu’s direction quietly.

He was calm, as top geniuses bound to appear in such a great era. Everything that happened seemed to be reasonable.

A moment later, the two armored soldiers returned. They cupped their hands and said, “First Elder, the person following the warship is Qin Yu.”

“Qin Yu?” A hint of surprise flashed across the elderly man’s eyes when he heard this. He then said, “He is that Qin Yu who defeated the Yao family’s Holy Son?”

“That’s right,” the two soldiers quickly said.

Before they could finish speaking, a few more people walked out. These three people had aged appearances and extraordinary internal qi. They wore linen robes and had secret treasures on them.

“First Elder, this Qin Yu has the Traceless Immortal Scripture that everyone in the world wants. Since he has appeared in front of us now, perhaps it’s an auspicious fate bestowed by heaven,” an elderly man in a linen robe said.

First Elder was silent. After a moment, he slowly opened his mouth and said, “I am indeed interested in the Traceless Immortal Scripture, but he is from the Thunder Courtyard. He might appear on the day of the Path of Heaven. If we attack him now, there might be a conflict at the place where the day of the Path of Heaven arrives.”

“First Elder, there’s no need to worry. So what if it’s Thunder Courtyard? He’s only valuable if he’s alive. Dean Lei will only be willing to protect him when he’s alive. But if he’s dead, his value will vanish. How would Dean Lei declare war on our Ni family for a dead person?” an elderly man in a linen robe said indifferently.

“That’s right. Thunder Courtyard has long become the public enemy of the various aristocratic families. If he were to make a move, it would definitely cause public outrage. No one would pay such a price for a dead person,” the other linen-robed elderly man said.

First Elder was silent for a moment before waving his hand and said, “Alright, alright. I’ll just apologize to Dean Lei in the future. Do things cleanly.”

Hearing this order, the linen-robed elderly men’s eyes flashed with a trace of ruthlessness. They silently nodded before disappearing from the warship. In the next moment, they appeared outside the warship and rapidly rushed toward Qin Yu.

Qin Yu sensed the hostility and slightly frowned. A cold light flashed in his eyes. He did not stop moving forward. Instead, he increased his speed and headed in the direction of the day of the Path of Heaven.

He knew the other party must be coveting the Traceless Immortal Scripture on him. This was also something that he had always been careful about.

Soon, the three linen-robed elders arrived in front of Qin Yu and blocked his way.

Qin Yu’s expression turned cold. He took a deep breath and said, “Seniors, I have no ill intentions. I just want to reach the place where the Path of Heaven arrives as soon as possible. Please fulfill my wish.”

“Yes, of course, you can. It’s even fine to let you board the ship.” One of the elderly men smiled faintly.

At this point, he suddenly changed the topic and said in a sinister voice, “However, there is a prerequisite. Hand over the Traceless Immortal Scripture.”

“As expected,” Qin Yu thought to himself. He was silent for a moment before saying, “Alright, I promise you.”
