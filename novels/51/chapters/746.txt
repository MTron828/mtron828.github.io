Chapter 747: Didn’t I Tell You to Leave Quickly? Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Looking at this scene, everyone gasped.

They didn’t know what had happened at all, but they knew very well that Qin Yu’s breakthrough this time was definitely not simple.

...

In the mountain forest, waves of light burst out from Qin Yu’s body.

This light was sometimes dazzling, sometimes restrained, and looked like a landscape painting.

The internal qi on his body was also rapidly increasing, from the early stage of the Martial Marquis Realm to the middle stage.

Level five, level six, level seven...

He was getting closer and closer to the late stage of the Martial Marquis Realm.

Qin Yu stuffed the Purple-gold Pills in his hand into his mouth one by one.

In the blink of an eye, only two of the six Purple-gold Pills were left.

At this time, Qin Yu was only a step away from the late stage of the Martial Marquis Realm.

At this moment, a figure suddenly appeared in the forest.

This person had a graceful figure and was full of charm. There was a hint of flirtatious air in her every move. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

This person was none other than the woman from the Han Palace who had come to snatch the mask the last time!

“I said I wouldn’t let you off...” this woman narrowed her eyes.

She stared at Qin Yu, who was sitting cross-legged, and a hint of killing intent flashed across her eyes.

Qin Yu, who was in closed-door cultivation, naturally felt this trace of strange internal qi.

He couldn’t help but frown, but he didn’t panic too much.

That woman was hiding in the dark and wasn’t in a hurry to make a move, as if she was waiting for an opportunity.

Qin Yu was the same. He didn’t pay any attention to this woman.

During the critical period of a breakthrough, he absolutely couldn’t be distracted.

Time flew by, and in the blink of an eye, it was night time.

The spiritual energy on Qin Yu’s body exploded again, and all the spiritual energy gathered in his dantian. With the golden core as the center, it was slowly being absorbed.

“Now is the time.” The woman’s eyes narrowed, and then her figure flashed as she walked toward Qin Yu!

“Qin Yu, we meet again.” The woman’s voice was charming.

This charm was somewhat similar to Fang Yue’s, but it seemed to be more flirtatious than Fang Yue’s.

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and ignored this woman.

“Have you thought about the consequences of stopping the Han Palace?” The woman said with a nonchalant smile.

Qin Yu ignored her. He sat there cross-legged, as if no one was there.

The woman walked in front of Qin Yu. She stretched out her smooth palm and slowly placed it on Qin Yu’s chest.

“Speaking of which, your body is really full of temptation... I really can’t bear to kill you just like that,” the woman said in a delicate voice.

“Sigh, but you’ve ruined so many things for me and even killed people from the Han Palace. I can only bear the pain and kill you.” The woman sighed, and her tone was somewhat regretful.

At this moment, Qin Yu, who was sitting cross-legged on the ground, finally opened his mouth.

He glanced at this woman and said indifferently, “If you don’t want to die, you’d better stay away from me.”

“Oh really?” A trace of surprise flashed in the woman’s eyes.

Her eyes curved as she said in a delicate voice, “You even dare to threaten me now? I’m really sad...”

This woman’s voice seemed to be able to affect one’s divine sense, bringing with it an extremely strong charm.

If one’s divine sense wasn’t strong enough, one would probably be instantly bewitched by her.

But to Qin Yu, it wasn’t of much use.

“Hurry up and leave. I don’t want to kill you just like that,” Qin Yu said indifferently.

The woman smiled coquettishly and said, “I’m so scared. I really want to see how you’ll kill me!”

As she spoke, the woman’s hands curled up, and her scallion-like fingers pierced straight towards Qin Yu’s chest!

Just as the fingers were about to touch Qin Yu’s chest, a golden light suddenly erupted from Qin Yu’s body!

This golden light was incomparably powerful, and with Qin Yu as the center, it swiftly swept out in all directions!

The woman’s expression suddenly changed. She was just about to retreat when this force swept out!

Her delicate body was instantly sent flying!

A mouthful of fresh blood spurted out from her mouth!

The woman’s expression changed. She wiped the blood at the corner of her mouth and exclaimed, “How... how is this possible?”

When she saw the golden light on Qin Yu’s body disappearing, the woman’s expression became even uglier.

She stood up from the ground and said coldly, “Looks like I can’t keep you. I have to kill you as soon as possible!”

As she spoke, the woman charged at Qin Yu again!

“Buzz!”

At this moment, Qin Yu’s body suddenly emitted a strange power.

This power spread out in the surroundings as if it had formed a strange aura.

The surrounding trees began to wither at an extremely fast speed! All the living beings were drawn out of their internal qi and gathered towards Qin Yu’s body!

“What... What’s going on?” The woman’s expression changed drastically!

She could clearly feel that the internal qi in her body was flowing away!

And the internal qi that was flowing out was all sucked into Qin Yu’s body!

“How... how could this be?” The woman tried her best to stop the internal qi from flowing away, but she realized that no matter how hard she tried, she couldn’t stop it!

“No... No, if this continues, I’m afraid I’ll be sucked dry...” beads of sweat dripped down the woman’s forehead.

She wanted to escape, but the internal qi was flowing out too quickly. Her body was already starting to weaken, and even walking seemed to be extremely difficult!

The internal qi was flowing into Qin Yu’s body, but the woman had already completely lost her strength.

She collapsed on the ground, unable to move.

“What kind of strange spell is this...” the woman was extremely terrified. She climbed on the ground, trying to escape.

But very quickly, she didn’t even have the strength to climb. She could only helplessly lie on the ground.

“Buzz!”

At this moment, streams of golden light burst out from Qin Yu’s body!

Following that, his internal qi began to rise rapidly!

Qin Yu’s body gradually turned from dark gold to crystal clear.

At a glance, one could even see crystal white bones.

However, in a short instant, his skin turned bronze. The suggestion of his internal qi could be seen with the naked eye!

“Boom!”

An internal qi burst out from Qin Yu’s body.

This internal qi shot straight into the sky, dispersing the clouds in the sky!

The ground beneath Qin Yu’s feet collapsed! The originally lush forest turned into earthen yellow ruins in the blink of an eye!

Dust covered the sky and covered the sun, obscuring one’s vision.

This powerful force shook the already extremely weak woman until she was drenched in blood!

Her clothes were shattered, revealing her fair flesh.

The dust gradually dispersed, and the surroundings slowly returned to calm.

A figure slowly walked over from not far away.

It was Qin Yu.

His expression was calm. Even though his internal qi was restrained, there was a powerful and oppressive feeling coming from his body.

“Didn’t I tell you to leave quickly?” Qin Yu walked in front of the woman and said condescendingly.
