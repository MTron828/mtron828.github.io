Chapter 504: Breaking Through to the Martial Marquis Realm! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

The Pavilion Master glanced at Qin Yu and said, “Let’s talk about it upstairs first.”

Qin Yu also realized that he had been reckless. He scratched his head while looking a little embarrassed.

Qin Yu followed behind the Pavilion Master, and they arrived at the Pavilion Master’s building.

The building was the same as before. There were no changes.

And the Pavilion Master was still sitting on her rocking chair as before.

She glanced at Qin Yu and said, “You didn’t manage to step into the half-step Martial Marquis Realm?”

Qin Yu hurriedly nodded and said, “Yes, I can feel that my strength has soared, but I always feel that there is a thin line between me and the half-step Martial Marquis Realm.”

A rare smile appeared on the Pavilion Master’s face.

“Should I congratulate you, or should I say that you are pitiful?” The Pavilion Master said with a smile.

Qin Yu was stunned and said with some confusion, “What... What do you mean?”

The Pavilion Master took a sip of tea and said, “You should know yourself.”

Qin Yu said in a deep voice, “Yes, I know that this might be the Consummate Inner Strength Grandmaster realm after the peak.”

“That’s right.” The Pavilion Master confirmed Qin Yu’s thoughts.

“It is said that those who have reached the Consummate Inner Strength Grandmaster realm are all cursed.”

“Although those who have reached the Consummate Inner Strength Grandmaster realm are invincible in the world, they are destined to have a bumpy road. Compared to other people’s cultivation path, theirs are countless times more difficult.”

Speaking up to this point, the Pavilion Master paused for a moment before continuing, “I once read a piece of information. According to the information, out of the ten people who have achieved Consummate Inner Strength Grandmaster realm, only one has broken through.”

Qin Yu frowned slightly.

The probability was actually so low?

“Eight of them died under the heavenly tribulation,” the Pavilion Master continued.

“Heavenly tribulation...” Qin Yu couldn’t help but think of something.

The heavenly tribulation he experienced was indeed beyond imagination.

It didn’t seem like the heavens wanted Qin Yu to successfully break through. Instead, it seemed like the heavens wanted to kill Qin Yu.

“A stalk of 5,000-year-old herbs, right?” The Pavilion Master didn’t continue this topic.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “I need a stalk of 5,000-year-old herbs and three demon beast inner cores.”

“5,000-year-old herbs? I don’t have them here either,” said the Pavilion Master.

“But I can help you find information.”

Qin Yu heard this and quickly said, “Then thank you, Pavilion Master!”

At this point, Qin Yu suddenly thought of the problem with the Spirit Severing Pill in the Pavilion Master’s body.

“Pavilion Master, your body...”

The Pavilion Master waved her hand and said, “There is no antidote for the Spirit Severing Pill.”

Qin Yu’s expression immediately became somewhat ugly!

These few days, Qin Yu had also tried to find the antidote for the Spirit Severing Pill from his inherited memories.

Unfortunately, he didn’t find anything.

“Pavilion Master, then wouldn’t you...” Qin Yu was unable to continue for a moment.

The Pavilion Master stood up and said indifferently, “Of course not. As long as I step into the Martial Marquis Realm, the Spirit Severing Pill’s effects will naturally disappear.”

“Step into the Martial Marquis Realm?” Qin Yu was stunned.

Then, he said with an embarrassed smile, “Pavilion Master, stepping into the Martial Marquis realm... can’t be that simple...”

The Pavilion Master said with a nonchalant smile, “Indeed, but for me, it’s not difficult.”

“All these years, I’ve been forcefully suppressing my realm. Now it seems that I can only try to break through.”

Forcefully suppressing her realm?

There was such a method?

Others were desperately trying to break through, but the Pavilion Master was actually forcefully suppressing her realm?

“Alright, I’ll help you think of a solution regarding the herbs.” The Pavilion Master stood up and said.

Qin Yu hurriedly nodded, and then asked, “Pavilion Master, then... when will you break through?”

The Pavilion Master was silent for a moment, and then said, “Tomorrow. I’m tired today, so I have to rest.”

“Okay.” Qin Yu nodded.

“Then I won’t disturb your rest.”

Qin Yu bowed, then turned his head and jumped down.

After returning to the Elder’s residence, Qin Yu couldn’t help but feel a little anxious.

He pinched his fingers and calculated the time. There were only 20 days left until September 9th!

If he couldn’t break through to the half-step Martial Marquis realm within these 20 days, then Qin Yu had no confidence of winning at all!

Since there hadn’t been any news about Han Wei recently, this made Qin Yu feel a trace of unease.

“Ruoxue, wait for me. In twenty days, I’ll definitely bring you out of the Yan family!” Qin Yu clenched his fists.

...

The next day was the day of the Pavilion Master’s breakthrough.

She arrived at the back mountain alone. She held her breath and prepared to break through.

The realm that she had suppressed for many years began to rapidly rise at this moment.

The sky rumbled and dark clouds covered the sky. It was a sign that the heavenly tribulation was coming!

Qin Yu and the many pharmacists of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion gathered in the square and watched this scene with eager eyes.

The sky was filled with thunderbolts. One after another, muffled thunderbolts poured down from the high sky.

Everyone had solemn expressions as they broke out in cold sweat for the Pavilion Master.

On the other hand, Gu Canghai’s expression was dark and no one knew what he was thinking. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“Sect master, don’t worry too much. It’s almost the 9th of September. Qin Yu will definitely die!” Elder Qu said eagerly.

Gu Canghai glanced at Elder Qu and didn’t say anything.

He felt a bit of heartache.

It wasn’t that he felt heartache for Elder Qu. It was just that he felt heartache for a half-step Martial Marquis to die just like this.

“He Teng is still in the Saint Confucian Sect, right?” Gu Canghai suddenly asked.

Elder Qu was stunned and quickly nodded. “That’s right. He has been in seclusion in the spirit spring.”

“Call him over. Later, you and He Teng will accompany me to the Divine Alchemist Pavilion,” Gu Canghai said in a deep voice.

Elder Qu’s expression couldn’t help but change.

He seemed to have realized something. After all, Qin Yu had mentioned that he wanted these two people.

“Sect... sect master, you aren’t planning to hand me over to Qin Yu, are you...” Elder Qu’s entire body trembled as he asked with some fear.

Gu Canghai said coldly, “Don’t worry. The two of you are just bait. With me around, you will be fine.”

Elder Qu thought about it and felt that it made sense.

With a Martial Marquis accompanying him, there was indeed nothing to worry about.

Hence, Elder Qu called He Teng and followed Gu Canghai onto the plane before heading straight for Qinghe town.

The Divine Alchemist Pavilion was in turmoil.

From morning till noon, the Pavilion Master’s heavenly tribulation was still not over.

The surging lightning made people tremble in fear.

Finally, at around twelve o’clock, the dark clouds in the sky began to slowly disappear.

The heavenly tribulation seemed to have ended.

Qin Yu immediately took a step forward to head to the back mountain to investigate.

At this moment, the Pavilion Master took a step forward and walked out.

Her internal qi didn’t seem to have changed much, but her aura had become even more otherworldly!

“Pavilion Master!” Qin Yu hurriedly walked forward.

“Did you... succeed in breaking through?” Qin Yu probed.

The Pavilion Master nodded slightly, but there didn’t seem to be much joy on her face.

In fact, there seemed to be a trace of sadness on her face.

“That’s good.” Qin Yu didn’t think too much and only heaved a sigh of relief.

In the evening, an extremely powerful internal qi was approaching the Divine Alchemist Pavilion.
