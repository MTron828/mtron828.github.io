Chapter 1133: Chapter 1,133. The ancestor had descended? 

As soon as these words were said, an unnatural expression flashed across pavilion master’s face.

“If the Dao Protector is willing to step forward, those eight mighty figures aren’t worth mentioning at all,”Zhai Xing said coldly.

“Furthermore, Qin Yu is his son. He definitely won’t sit idly by.”

Pavilion master didn’t speak for a long time. No one knew what he was thinking.

Seeing this, Zhai Xing could not help but narrow his eyes and coldly said, “You said that he is the son of the Dao Protector. You are not lying to me, right?” Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

“He is indeed the son of the Dao Protector.”Finally, pavilion master spoke.

Her beautiful eyes looked at Zhai Xing and said, “But do you know that as a dao protector, one absolutely can not mix personal feelings.”

“If he makes a move today for Qin Yu, will he still be a dao protector tomorrow? Will he be punished?”

Hearing this, a strange light flashed in Zhai Xing’s eyes.

He faintly said, “No wonder you care so much about Qin Yu. It seems that your longing for a dao protector is not a rumor.”

At the mention of a dao protector, the expression of the pavilion master turned ugly.

No one knew what had happened between them.

“Don’t tell me you want to Watch Qin Yu throw his life away?”Zhai Xing said in a deep voice.

Pavilion master shook his head and said, “It’s not that I want to watch him throw his life away. It’s just that... the Dao protector will absolutely not make a move. It’s impossible for him to kill eight mighty figures just for Qin Yu.”

Zhai xing frowned and asked, “Why?”

Pavilion master said, “Think carefully. Since Qin Yu made his debut, how many times has he encountered such a life-and-death situation? has the Dao Protector ever made a move?”

“It’s different. This time is different from any other time. Qin Yu has no chance of winning in front of the eight mighty figures,”Zhai Xing said coldly.

Pavilion master played with the Teacup in his hand as if he was thinking about something.

“Could it be that he didn’t leave behind any keepsake for You?”Zhai Xing asked in puzzlement.

“Keepsake?”Pavilion master lightly snorted. “He’s an extremely heartless person. Even if I die in front of him, he won’t even Blink.”

Speaking up to this point, Zhai Xing suddenly sat up straight.

He swept his gaze around him. After confirming that there was no one around, he softly said, “Just who is Qin Yu’s mother? Why have I never heard of her? It Can’t Be You, right?”

A trace of pain flashed across the pavilion master’s brows, and then he shook his head and said, “If I had such a son, I would be willing to die.”

“Oh? Do you want to have a night of pleasure with the Dao Protector, or are you proud of Qin Yu?”Zhai Xing teased.

Hearing this, a trace of coldness flashed across the pavilion master’s eyes.

Zhai Xing hurriedly waved his hand and said, “Forget it, let’s get down to business.”

Pavilion master coldly said, “It’s not reliable to rely on dao protectors. You’d better give up on this idea.”

Zhai Xing rubbed his chin and said, “Why don’t we... Let Qin Yu escape? Or rather... let the authorities step in?”

“The authorities step in?”Pavilion master was instantly stunned.

This might be a method, but... Was the authorities willing to do this?

For the sake of Qin Yu, completely falling out with the eight mighty figures might not necessarily be a good decision.

“Let’s escape.”After thinking about it for a while, the pavilion master finally made a decision.

“The best strategy is to let Qin Yu escape. Although mighty figures are strong, they still can’t look down on the entire Earth.”

Zhai Xing sighed and said in a low voice, “I’m Afraid Qin Yu doesn’t want to escape at all. If he escapes, the unlucky ones will be us.”

The current Qin Yu was no longer the unfettered Qin Yu. He had too many followers by his side.

Since he had accepted them, he had to be responsible for them.

The two of them fell into silence, as if neither of them could think of a foolproof plan.

At this moment, Qin Yu was comprehending the ‘xing’character formula.

The ‘xing’character formula was incomparably profound. It was a true supreme saint technique. Even in the Holy Region, it was a first-class existence.

Fortunately, Qin Yu’s comprehension ability was far beyond ordinary people. He spent six days to comprehend the ‘xing’character formula to the third level.

But on the fourth level, Qin Yu was unable to advance even half a step.

He slightly opened his eyes and said in a low voice, “When I fought with Han Wei previously, I once comprehended a spell. This spell can forcefully raise one’s realm.”

“I wonder if this spell conflicts with the line character formula, and if it can be superimposed.”

If it could be superimposed, then the strength displayed would definitely be beyond imagination.

However, he was already too close to the appearance of the higher-ups, so Qin Yu did not dare to rashly try.

After all, the consequence of forcefully upgrading the spell was that he could not move for several days. At that time, he would probably become a lamb waiting to be slaughtered.

Qin Yu slowly stood up.

He calculated the time. There were only two days left.

Qin Yu hurriedly stood up and walked all the way to the vicinity of the tunnel.

As expected, the passageway became even larger. This time, Qin Yu could even hear faint voices coming from within, as if someone was talking.

Qin Yu hurriedly leaned on the entrance of the passageway and listened carefully.

“At this rate, in less than three days, we will be able to break the seal.”

“Mm, once the seal is broken, we must not hold back. We must kill Qin Yu immediately.”

“That’s right. Kill him immediately before the Holy Region Opens! Everyone, use your trump cards to ensure that we get rid of him immediately. Otherwise, once the holy region opens, our chances of killing him will be slim.”

“Leaving him alive will bring endless trouble. As long as we can get rid of him, any price is worth it.”

These words entered Qin Yu’s ears.

Qin Yu could not help but frown.

He touched his chin and said in a low voice, “It seems that these people are determined to kill me.”

Taking action was his trump card. Qin Yu was not easy to deal with.

“Damn it.”At this moment, Qin Yu suddenly stood up.

He thought about it and decided to lie down near the tunnel. Then, he exerted all his strength, he shouted, “Eight old bastards, you still want to kill me? Go To Hell, I’ll wait for you here. As long as you dare to come, I’ll Smash Your Heads!”

“Eh? What Voice? Who is speaking?”Soon, a startled voice came from the other end.

“Your ancestor is speaking. If you hear his voice, hurry up and kneel down!”Qin Yu continued to shout.

“Ancestor? Could it be that the Holy Region has already opened? has the ancestor’s divine sense descended?”A higher-up exclaimed.
