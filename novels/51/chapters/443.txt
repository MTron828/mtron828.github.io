Chapter 444: The Birth of the Dragon Spirit! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Looking at the rockery that had transformed into Mount Tai in front of them, everyone gasped!

“This rockery looks so familiar.”

“I feel like I’ve seen it somewhere before.”

“I remember now! Isn’t this Mount Tai?! I’ve even climbed it before!”

Everyone discussed animatedly and their eyes were filled with disbelief!

As for the man with the big belly, he regretted it! He kept saying, “You have to return this rockery to me!”

Qin Yu, not saying a word, glanced at him.

Return such a sacred object to him? Dream on!

Although Qin Yu did not know what kind of strength the Venerable Fifth Mountain could display, even a fool knew what the Venerable Fifth Mountain represented.

Qin Yu tried to use his internal qi to activate the rockery. As expected, streams of internal qi spread out from the mountain.

“It’s indeed a magic artifact! It’s probably more powerful than I imagined!” Qin Yu said while holding back his excitement!

Through telekinesis, the mountain came to Qin Yu’s head.

Streams of internal qi spread out from the mountain.

The internal qi was like a waterfall, enveloping Qin Yu from top to bottom!

“These are both magic artifacts. Let me see whose magic artifact is stronger,” Qin Yu said coldly to He Teng.

He Teng frowned.

He was not a fool. He could naturally tell that the magic artifact on Qin Yu’s head was extraordinary.

“Meng Wuxiong! Stop him! I’m going to summon the Dragon Spirit!” He Teng shouted.

Meng Wuxiong rubbed his fist and grinned. “No problem. Leave it to me.”

As he spoke, Meng Wuxiong had already walked towards Qin Yu.

The magic artifact above his head was shining brilliantly.

Qin Yu, on the other hand, closed his eyes and felt the power from the Venerable Fifth Mountain.

Under the cover of the Venerable Fifth Mountain, Qin Yu felt that his entire body was as hard as a mountain rock!

In his body, there was an endless amount of power!

“Playing tricks? Kid, watch me blow your head off with one punch!” Meng Wuxiong roared angrily.

With that said, he raised the magic artifact above his head and stepped on the ground. Suddenly, the sword rushed towards Qin Yu!

The huge force stirred up a violent wind!

The entire ground was lifted several feet by this force!

Qin Yu’s expression was calm.

Just as Meng Wuxiong’s fist was about to smash into his face, Qin Yu suddenly raised his fist!

Golden light instantly burst out!

And above Qin Yu’s head, the Venerable Fifth Mountain flickered with rays of light!

“Boom!”

The two fists collided powerfully!

The huge impact force sent the group of rich people flying!

“Crack!”

A layer of cracks appeared on the ground beneath Qin Yu’s feet, and his body sank a few feet into the ground!

“Buzz!”

At this moment, the magic artifact above Qin Yu’s head unleashed its power!

An ancient and simple internal qi poured into Qin Yu’s body, and the light on his fists suddenly brightened by dozens of degrees!

“Boom!”

Under this enormous force, Meng Wuxiong was flying backwards, like a kite with a broken string!

His huge body smashed into the ground! A huge pit with a diameter of a few meters was created!

On the other hand, Qin Yu was unharmed under the protection of the magic artifact!

“As expected of the Venerable Fifth Mountain.” Qin Yu licked his lips, and a trace of excitement flashed in his eyes.

No one had expected such a treasure on this lavish cruise ship!

“Swoosh!”

At this moment, Meng Wuxiong flew out of the huge pit!

His eyes were wide open, and the muscles all over his body were trembling!

“Qin Yu! I’m going to kill you! !” Meng Wuxiong raised his head and roared. The magic artifact above his head also began to tremble!

A terrifying power was surging into his body!

An ominous aura spread over Brightheart Island!

“Go to h*ll!”

Accompanied by Meng Wuxiong’s angry roar, the magic artifact above his head suddenly floated over!

A powerful suppressive force ruthlessly smashed toward Qin Yu!

Qin Yu clenched his fists and faced it head-on!

“Clang!”

This was a collision between a physical body and a magic artifact!

Qin Yu’s physical body also borrowed the power of the magic artifact!

Qin Yu, who already had an unparalleled physical body, was now unleashing an unimaginable power!

“Clang!”

He thrust another punch!

Meng Wuxiong’s magic artifact began to tremble and could no longer get any closer!

“Clang!”

Under the third punch, cracks began to appear on Meng Wuxiong’s magic artifact!

“Crack!”

In the blink of an eye, the magic artifact let out a crisp sound and turned into ashes!

The crowd was silent.

Everyone couldn’t help but gasp.

What kind of power was this? ?! He actually shattered a magic artifact with three punches?! !

“It seems that your magic artifact isn’t very good.” Qin Yu sneered.

Meng Wuxiong’s expression was extremely ugly. His huge body, like a deflated rubber ball, was slowly returning to its original state.

“How... how is this possible?!” A trace of anger and fear flashed in Meng Wuxiong’s eyes! Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Qin Yu looked coldly at Meng Wuxiong and said, “Without the support of the magical artifact, how can you fight with me? I’ll kill you like chopping melons and vegetables!”

As he spoke, Qin Yu walked step by step towards Meng Wuxiong.

A trace of fear flashed in Meng Wuxiong’s eyes. He hurriedly looked at He Teng and shouted, “He Teng, save me!”

However, He Teng’s eyes were closed at this moment. He was concentrating on summoning the Dragon Spirit!

It was rumored that the strength of a person who obtained the Dragon Spirit would undergo a tremendous change!

How could He Teng pay attention to Meng Wuxiong?!

He Teng uttered numerous incantations.

Fang Yue, who was lying on the ground, was already unconscious.

Qin Yu’s expression changed. He looked at He Teng and said coldly, “I won’t let you get away with it!”

After saying that, Qin Yu took large strides towards He Teng!

“Qin Yu, it’s already too late!” He Teng roared with a hint of madness.

“Dragon Spirit, rise!”

Along with He Teng’s furious roar, the entire sea surface seemed to boil as it began to rumble!

“Tsunami!” The group of rich people were so frightened that their faces turned pale as they fled!

Qin Yu stared at the churning surface of the sea with an ugly expression on his face.

Rays of light shot out from the bottom of the sea!

The golden rays of light lit up the entire surface of the sea!

“Splash!”

The surface of the sea kept churning, as if something was about to come out.

“Dragon Spirit... Dragon Spirit!” He Teng seemed to have gone mad as he stared at that ray of light!

Finally, a loud sound came from the surface of the sea!

Then, a huge light floated up from the surface of the sea!

“Dragon Spirit, I’ve finally found you! ! !” He Teng roared crazily! Then, he took a step forward and rushed towards the Dragon Spirit!

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and sneered. “I’m sorry, but this Dragon Spirit is mine!”
