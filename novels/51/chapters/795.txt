Chapter 796: Chapter 796, uncontrollable killing intent Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Huang Ren’s expression instantly changed drastically!

It was really Qin Yu!

When the Heavenly Peace Alliance was exterminated that day, he happened to be absent and narrowly avoided the calamity.

But he never expected to meet Qin Yu here again today!

“Exterminating the Heavenly Peace Alliance? What the F * ck are you talking about?”Young master huang was still recklessly clamoring.

Huang Ren’s expression changed. He slapped young master Huang hard on the face and cursed, “Hurry up and apologize to sect leader Qin!”

“There’s no need to apologize.”Qin Yu shook his head.

“I said I’ll only give you one hour. It’s already been one hour and five minutes,”Qin Yu said coldly

Huang Ren’s forehead immediately broke out in cold sweat. He said with a trembling voice, “Sect leader Qin, i... I didn’t expect it to be you...”

“That has nothing to do with me,”Qin Yu said coldly.

“Since you have exceeded the time limit, you must be punished.”

After saying that, Qin Yu raised his hand and smashed young master Huang into meat paste.

Yang Jing, who was at the side, suddenly screamed in fear. Huang Ren’s face was full of grief.

“Okay, it’s your turn,”Qin Yu said. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“I’m merciful and soft-hearted, so I won’t destroy your entire family. It’s enough to just kill the two of you.”

Huang Ren hurriedly said, “No... Don’t. Sect Master Qin, I already know my mistake. I promise I Won’t disturb Miss Yang again. I...”

“Slap!”

Before he could finish, Qin Yu had already smashed Huang Ren’s head with a slap.

In the blink of an eye, the Huang father and son died here.

Yang Jing couldn’t help but cover her mouth. Her eyes were full of horror.

Qin Yu glanced at Yang Jing and said, “Well, your problem has been solved. Don’t worry.”

After saying that, Qin Yu flicked his finger, and a wisp of spiritual fire directly burned the bodies of the two people into ashes.

Yang Jing’s face was still full of fear.

It was impossible for two people to die in front of her. It was impossible to say that they were not afraid.

Seeing this, Qin Yu didn’t know what to say.

After more than an hour, Yang Jing finally calmed down a little.

She whispered, “Qin Yu, are the major forces in Shengguo Really Yours?”

“Of course,”Qin Yu said with a smile.

“If you have any problems in the future, call me. The people of the Heaven’s Gate will help you.”

“Thank... Thank you.”Yang Jing sighed slightly.

Seeing her expression, Qin Yu couldn’t help but say, “Do you think I’m Too Cruel? There’s no need to kill them?”

Yang Jing bit her lip and said, “I just don’t think there’s a need to kill Huang Ren. He’s already scared out of his wits...”

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “Yang Jing, I’ve experienced a lot in the past two years, and I’ve slowly learned a truth.”

“Being merciful to the enemy is cruel to yourself. Their fear of me will pass day by day with time. When that time comes, the one who will suffer will be you.”

Yang Jing was deep in thought when she heard this.

Qin Yu stood up and said, “Well, I still have something to do, so I won’t stay any longer. If there’s anything, you can call me again.”

“Are you leaving in such a hurry?”Yang Jing said in surprise.

“Yes, I have something important to deal with when I return to China,”Qin Yu said.

With that, Qin Yu walked out of the door with the handlebar mustache.

Yang Jing whispered behind him, “In any case, Qin Yu, thank you very much.”

Qin Yu smiled and said no more.

After leaving the Yang family, Qin Yu and the handlebar mustache went directly to the airport.

After arriving at the airport, Qin Yu and the handlebar mustache sat there quietly waiting for the plane.

At this moment, the moustache man suddenly asked, “Qin Yu, do you feel that your killing intent is getting stronger and stronger? If it were in the past, would you have massacred the entire sect?”

Qin Yu remained silent. He naturally realized this problem.

For some reason, Qin Yu’s killing intent was extremely serious recently. Many times, he could not even restrain himself.

“Sigh, I suspect that you have been infected by that masked woman,”the moustache man muttered.

Qin Yu looked at the handlebar mustache and said, “I’ve seen my own path of cultivation before. It’s a path of killing. It has nothing to do with others.”

The handlebar mustache shrunk his neck and muttered, “Just don’t kill me.”

Qin Yu said jokingly, “That’s hard to say. Be careful.”

...

At this moment, in the country.

Granny Qin, who had been sleeping for many days, finally woke up.

Under the treatment of the martial arts association, her body had completely recovered.

She was sitting in her room. Beside her, there was a huge python coiled up.

And this Python was Blackie’s heaven-swallowing Python.

Granny Qin lovingly stroked Blackie’s head and said, “Don’t worry, I’ll definitely make you return to your human form as soon as possible.”

Blacky used his huge head to gently rub Granny Qin, as if in response.

Granny Qin couldn’t help but recall the scene of the battle that day.

As well as the two terrifying corpses beside Qin Yu and that strange little girl, Xiao Yu.

“Just what kind of secret is Qin Yu hiding...”recalling that day, a trace of horror flashed across Granny Qin’s face!

She didn’t even dare to look for Qin Yu again, afraid that she would run into those two corpses!

With just a glance, he had shattered the martial saint’s weapon. What kind of strength was this!

At this moment, Granny Qin’s phone rang.

Picking up the phone, two cold words came from the other end: meeting.

Granny Qin didn’t dare to be negligent. She hurriedly got up and rushed to the conference room of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association.

In the conference room, all the higher-ups had already arrived.

This time, Xia hang also participated in a rare event.

Granny Qin quickly rushed to the venue. Facing the few higher-ups, Granny Qin could not help but lower her head.

“I’m sorry, I wasn’t able to do my job well.”Granny Qin lowered her head and did not dare to stand up for a long time.

“Alright, it’s useless to talk about this. Come and sit down,”said a higher-up.

Hearing this, Granny Qin quickly walked over and sat down.

“Granny Qin, I have two important tasks for you,”a higher-up said.

Granny Qin quickly said, “Please give me your orders!”

The higher-up said coldly, “Bring the two corpses beside Qin Yu and the little girl called Xiao Yu here.”

Hearing this, a trace of panic flashed across Granny Qin’s face.

She said in a trembling voice, “My lords, those two corpses possess extraordinary strength. With my ability, I’m afraid...”

“It’s Alright,”a higher-up said.

“Those two corpses were figures from ten thousand years ago. Although I don’t know why they suddenly awakened their consciousness last time, this kind of situation is very difficult to happen.”

“You can bring your people there. We will give you the martial saint weapon again.”

Hearing this, Granny Qin quickly nodded and said, “Yes, I will do it right away.”

“Yes, remember, you must do it as soon as possible. If you can get those two corpses, they will definitely be of great use.”

“To us, it might be of historic significance.”
