Chapter 1405: Chapter 1405, facing the first elder

Hearing Qin Yu’s words, the first elder immediately heaved a sigh of relief.

He looked coldly at Qin Yu and said, “Then don’t waste everyone’s time.”

Qin Yu didn’t waste any time. He strode towards the direction of the door.

Seeing this, the first elder immediately said to the people beside him, “Guard the door well. Once he appears, immediately catch him. If you can’t catch him, kill him!”

“Yes.”The people around him all nodded.

The great elder himself had also made preparations. His aura was adjusted to the extreme and condensed between his hands, ready to explode at any time.

Soon, Qin Yu walked to the gate.

He stood there and shouted to the great elder, “Great Elder, I heard that you were seriously injured by my master, Wen Wan, and almost lost your life. Is that true?”

The veins on the great elder’s forehead twitched, and a hint of displeasure flashed across his face.

“It seems to be true.”Qin Yu laughed loudly.

“I am Wen Wanyun’s disciple. He seriously injured you once, and I should also seriously injure you once.”

The great elder said coldly, “Little Bastard, don’t show the power of words. If you leave this divine capital city, see if I can kill you!”

Qin Yu laughed loudly and said, “Alright, I’ll Come Out Now!”

With that, Qin Yu pushed open the door and jumped out.

In an instant, the first elder quickly attacked, ruthlessly crushing towards Qin Yu’s direction!

But at this moment, Qin Yu shrank back again.

“Hahahaha! I went out, and I came in again. Are you angry?”Qin Yu laughed crazily.

The blue veins on the first elder’s forehead were like dragons that were bursting out. He was obviously angered by Qin Yu.

“Little Bastard, if you are playing me, I will kill them now!”The first elder said angrily.

Qin Yu sighed and said, “Alright, then I will fight with you.”

With that, Qin Yu took a deep breath.

He closed his eyes slightly and directly opened the fifth level of the fighting word formula.

In an instant, Qin Yu’s body was filled with vast spiritual power.

He took a step out of the divine capital, and the same scene happened again. Countless spells were coming straight at Qin Yu!

This time, Qin Yu didn’t Dodge. His right fist shone, and golden light flourished. Surging power suddenly appeared in his right fist, like a bomb that was about to explode!

Blue veins popped up on his right arm, and he roared angrily, and his fist fiercely met it!

“Ah! !” Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

He shouted at the top of his lungs, indicating the extreme power of this punch!

Facing so many spells, Qin Yu only had a pair of iron fists!

“Boom!”

Finally, the spells collided with Qin Yu’s fist, and the entire ground instantly exploded!

Terrifying power ripples rippled in all directions, and the powerful force even shattered the ground beneath his feet!

In just a split second, all the ground around the divine capital collapsed!

As if a huge earthquake had occurred, the huge pit extended for hundreds of meters! Everything in the surrounding area was destroyed!

The dust covered their vision. The first elder and the others stared in Qin Yu’s direction as if they were waiting for something.

However, when the dust dispersed, Qin Yu revealed his unyielding figure!

The clothes on his body had been shattered, and his exposed muscles were shining under the setting sun.

A cold smile hung on Qin Yu’s face. He raised his head to look at the first elder, revealing a mouthful of white teeth.

“First Elder, is there a point in bringing these miscellaneous diseases?”Qin Yu sneered.

The first elder and the hemp-robed elder beside him had ugly expressions.

“How can this kid’s physical strength be so terrifying?”The hemp-robed elder said coldly.

“If he recovers his spiritual power, I’m afraid that not many people in the entire South Province are his match.”

The first elder naturally understood this logic. His feet shook slightly, and his body left the carriage and stood in mid-air.

“Little Bastard, you really have some ability.”The first elder’s hair danced wildly. Although his tone was calm, his aura didn’t decrease.

Qin Yu looked at the first elder coldly, he said, “First Elder, it is said that you accompanied the sect master of the Heavenly Cloud sect in the past and made great contributions. Your strength is one of the best in the Heavenly Cloud Sect. However, you seem to have lost quite a number of times. Today, I may have to add another stroke to your name.”

“Arrogant child, you don’t know how to restrain yourself. The sect master was kind enough to spare your life, but you killed his beloved son. This is enough to prove your arrogance.”The first elder said coldly.

Qin Yu was full of anger at the mention of this matter.

He couldn’t help but curse, “It’s obvious that someone is deliberately stirring up trouble. Moreover, he is the one who provoked me. Can’t you guys find out the truth?”

“Cut the crap! You have to pay with your life if you kill someone!”The great elder shouted angrily.

“Screw you! Your disciple Ling Yun massacred the city every day. Tens of thousands of people died in his hands. You Old Bastard, you have killed quite a number of people. Why Don’t you pay with your life?”Qin Yu couldn’t help but curse.

The Great Elder’s face turned even more ashen. He knew that he couldn’t win against Qin Yu, so he didn’t say anything more.

“I’ll kill you right now. If you have anything to say, go down and say it.”The great elder raised his hands.

Qin Yu sneered, “I’ll return the same words to you. Let me see how strong you really are.”

The Great Elder’s aura rose to its peak.

Qin Yu was the same. His body tensed up, and vast divine power spread throughout his body.
