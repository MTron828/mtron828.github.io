1833 Sowing Discord

Hearing Qin Yu’s name, Grand Master Feng narrowed his eyes.

He instantly raised his finger and pressed forward. That bit of light immediately disappeared.

Immediately after, Grand Master Feng stepped forward and stood in front of the burly man.

“You know Qin Yu?” he asked in surprise.

“If not?” the burly man said snappishly.

!!

“What’s your relationship with Qin Yu?” Grand Master Feng frowned and asked.

“Brothers!” the burly man said without hesitation.

This person was none other than Chang Mang!

He had rushed to Thunder Courtyard after receiving the news.

Unfortunately, he had never heard of Thunder Courtyard, nor did he know the role Qin Yu was playing there.

Grand Master Feng was silent for a long time. Although he was not unfamiliar with Qin Yu, he had heard of him.

Seeing the burly man in front of him, he felt compassion for him for a moment.

Most importantly, Chang Mang’s talent had indeed stunned him.

He had a holy body and terrifying explosive power, but he was a little too reckless.

“Take him to see the dean.” After much consideration, Grand Master Feng finally decided to let the dean make the decision.

Therefore, with everyone’s effort, Chang Mang was brought to the dean.

The dean’s internal qi was extremely gentle but overbearing at the same time that no one dared to look at him directly.

Even with Chang Mang’s personality, he became rather polite for a moment.

Grand Master Feng explained to the dean what had happened. The dean couldn’t help but stroke his beard and smile.

He looked at Chang Mang, smiled, and said, “You and Qin Yu are old friends?”

“We’re brothers!” Chang Mang said proudly.

“Did you two come from the same place?” the dean continued to ask.

Chang Mang was startled, but he nodded in the end.

The dean’s gaze swept over Chang Mang and said, “You have a holy body, and your strength is extraordinary. You’re a budding genius.”

“Which main peak do you wish to join?” the dean asked after much thought.

“What main peak? What’s that?” Chang Mang was at a loss.

The dean had no choice but to get someone to tell Chang Mang about the rules and the general structure of Thunder Courtyard.

Chang Mang couldn’t help but be surprised after hearing this.

Although he had never heard of Thunder Courtyard, he had heard of the Yan family of the nine great aristocratic families.

It was because Yan Ruoxue was from the Yan family, one of the nine great aristocratic families.

Seeing Chang Mang’s shocked expression, the dean smiled faintly.

“You should make a decision now,” the dean said.

“I’ll be wherever Qin Yu is,” Chang Mang muttered. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“You can go to Demon-slaying Peak then,” the dean waved his hand and said indifferently.

Chang Mang agreed. He then stood up and prepared to leave.

At this moment, the dean changed the topic abruptly and said indifferently, “I will only give you this one chance. If you break the rules of Thunder Courtyard again, no one will be able to save you.”

Chang Mang tensed up slightly. He turned around and said, “I know.”

Soon, Chang Mang was brought to Demon-slaying Peak.

Just like when Qin Yu had first joined, Chang Mang had to pass through the formation.

However, passing through this formation was very easy for Chang Mang. Everyone was extremely shocked.

Coupled with Chang Mang’s ferocious appearance, it was obvious that he was not to be trifled with. Soon, the entire Demon-slaying Peak was filled with curiosity toward Chang Mang.

“This Chang Mang seems to be Qin Yu’s friend.”

“Qin Yu’s friend? This fellow’s friends are all freaks.”

“Speaking of which, this Chang Mang is quite similar to Jue Wu. They both have fiery personalities.”

Cao Huang swayed his arms and said, “I like tough guys like him. I’ll challenge him in a while!”

Just as he finished speaking, someone said from the side.

“Did you guys hear? When Chang Mang first arrived at Thunder Courtyard, he single-handedly defeated dozens of people! Even Grand Master Feng was almost beaten up by him!”

“What? Even the Grand Master had almost been beaten up? Isn’t this guy a little too abnormal?”

Cao Huang, who was standing at the side, even shrunk his neck. He even felt like backing off.

Good news traveled slowly, and bad news had wings.

The news about Chang Mang became more mysterious as it spread.

The fact that he had almost beaten up Grand Master Feng had become he was on par with Grand Master Feng and had fought for several days on the first main peak.

There were also rumors that Chang Mang was the descendant of some prehistoric beast. And he had the bloodline of the first generation of the ancient Fierce Beast in his body, making him extremely terrifying.

Chang Mang naturally knew nothing about these rumors.

He was determined to find Qin Yu as soon as possible. Therefre, he went to see the peak master on the same day to ask about Qin Yu.

In the peak master’s cave abode, Jiu Xiao and the peak master were playing chess day and night as usual.

When he saw Chang Mang walk in, the peak master said without lifting his head, “Chang Mang, what’s the matter?”

“Peak Master, where’s Qin Yu?” Chang mang asked courteously. “I’ve been here for a few days. Why haven’t I seen him yet?”

“Qin Yu is in closed-door cultivation. I’m afraid it will take some time before he can come out,” the peak master said indifferently.

“D*mn it!” When Chang Mang heard this, he couldn’t help but curse. “This brat has actually gone into closed-door seclusion at this time. How detestable!”

After saying this, Chang Mang walked out.

Demon-slaying Peak had no lack of meddlesome people.

As there was too much hearsay about Chang Mang, people were even more curious about his strength.

Therefore, a few Devil Hunters discussed and came up with a brilliant plan.

On this day.

Just as Chang Mang was about to return to his cave abode, he saw a few people standing at the entrance of the cave abode.

Chang Mang walked over with suspicion. He swept his gaze over these people and asked, “What’s the matter?”

One of the Devil Hunters laughed and said, “Chang Mang my friend, I’ve heard that you and Qin Yu are close friends. Is it true?”

“Are you talking nonsense? If he wasn’t a close friend, why would I come all the way here to find him?” Chang Mang muttered.

“Chang Mang my friend, do you know why Qin Yu chose to go into closed-door seclusion?” the Devil Hinter sighed and said.

Chang Mang thought for a moment and said, “It must be he wants to increase his strength as soon as possible.”

“No, you’re wrong. He was bullied at Demon-slaying Peak and couldn’t survive,” the Devil Hunter sighed and said.

“Thus Qin Yu had no choice but to go into closed-door seclusion to avoid the fight.”

Upon hearing this, Chang Mang’s expression instantly darkened.

But soon, he frowned and said, “With Qin Yu’s strength, who can bully him?”

“Qin Yu’s strength is certainly not a problem. But because of his unmentioned injuries, his strength is affected.” The Devil Hunter continued to make up stories.

“Sigh! Qin Yu’s life at Demon-slaying Peak was really too miserable. He was bossed around all day long. It was very pathetic.”

Other Devil Hunters added, “That’s right. Jiu Xiao bullied Qin Yu every day. There were a few occasions when Qin Yu almost died. He was too ruthless.”

The simple-minded Chang Mang’s face turned red when he heard what they said. His chest was even filled with anger.
