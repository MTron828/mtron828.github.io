After hearing Qin Yu’s words, the young man quickly pulled him back. He shook his head and said, “I advise you not to go there rashly. Although it seems that Li Yingying is in charge of Nanzhou, the actual person in command is the Tong family.”

Qin Yu remained silent, waiting for him to continue.

“Not long ago, Zhuo Jing went to look for Li Yingying alone, asking her to release Lord Jue Wu,” the young man continued.

“And then?” Qin Yu asked with a frown.

“After that… Zhuo Jing’s whereabouts were unknown. Whether he’s alive or dead remains unknown,” the young man said in a deep voice.

Qin Yu’s face turned cold and murmured in a low voice, “Li Yingying, you committed another crime…”

“Qin Yu, I know about your relationship with Lord Jue Wu, but I advise you not to take the risk,” the young man advised.

“I have my own plans,” Qin Yu nodded slightly and said.

After saying that, Qin Yu did not say anything else and headed to Tianyun Sect hurriedly.

The young man knew he couldn’t stop Qin Yu. After thinking for a while, he finally decided to follow him quietly.

Soon, Qin Yu arrived at the city wall of Tianyun Sect.

There were streaks of blood on the city wall, flowing down along the wall and onto the ground.

This bloodstain naturally came from Jue Wu, but she was no longer on the city wall.

Seeing this, Qin Yu was even more furious.

He looked at the city wall in front of him and coldly said, “Li Yingying, come out!”

With the shout, the entire city wall instantly trembled!

Li Yingying, who was drinking tea, was startled by the roar.

The house was shaking and the formation of Tianyun Sect was rumbling as if it would shatter at any moment.

“This voice… It’s Qin Yu!” Li Yingying was stunned for a moment, and then overjoyed! Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

She hurriedly got up and gathered all the Tong family members.

There were a total of six Reversion Void Stage cultivators, and each possessed terrifying power.

“The voice just now was Qin Yu’s,” Li Yingying said as she suppressed the excitement in her heart.

When everyone heard this, their eyes also flashed with a trace of excitement.

“Qin Yu? Did he really come to our door?” one of them said in surprise.

“Li Yingying, is what you said true?” someone asked doubtfully.

Li Yingying opened her mouth and was about to say something when Qin Yu’s voice sounded again.

The shout directly shattered the formation. The house could no longer hold on and collapsed in an instant!

Everyone’s feet trembled, and they quickly fled.

“This voice is Qin Yu’s voice. It’s definitely him!” Li Yingying couldn’t hold back the excitement in her heart.

She said to the crowd, “Hurry up and take him down!” Quick!”

“You don’t have to tell us. We’ve been staying here to capture Qin Yu. I didn’t expect him to come to us!” the men sneered and said.

A few of them looked at each other and immediately walked out of the city gate.

Li Yingying naturally did not want to fall behind. She quickly caught up and walked in front of them.

Qin Yu’s two shouts not only shook the entire Tianyun Sect but also all the cultivators nearby!

“The voice just now… It seems to be Qin Yu!”

“He really came! After almost a year, he finally came!”

“Rumor has it that he has gone to Thunder Courtyard. He’s likely sought help from Thunder Courtyard!”

In an instant, all the cultivators rushed over to see how Qin Yu would deal with the Tong family!

However, when they saw that Qin Yu was alone, they were stunned.

“He alone?”

“Alone… Did he come to die?”

“No. Look at his internal qi! Obviously, he’s stepped into the Reversion Void Stage!”

“So what if he is a Reversion Void Stage cultivator? Xiao Sheng was also a Reversion Void Stage cultivator, but didn’t he run away in the end?”

The crowd chimed in one after another, and it seemed that none of them were optimistic about Qin Yu’s chances.

There was no other reason other than the fact that Qin Yu was going to face a powerful aristocratic family in Zhongzhou!

Such an aristocratic family was not something that Nanzhou could compare with!

Qin Yu didn’t say a word, but his cold eyes seemed to be shooting through the sky.

A moment later.

Li Yingying was the first to appear on the city wall, and the few Revdersion Void Stage cultivators followed closely behind her and stood beside her.

“Hey, isn’t this Qin Yu? How dare you show up? I thought you were a coward,” Li Yingying said sarcastically.

Qin Yu looked at Li Yingying coldly and said, ” You d*mn thing ..”

“Hahaha! Are you regretting it? Are you regretting not killing me back then?” Li Yingying laughed smugly.

“What a pity, Qin Yu. You won’t have another chance!”

Qin Yu didn’t want to waste time talking to her, so he asked coldly, “Where’s Jue Wu?

“Jue Wu? Let me think… It seemed she was dead. Oh no, I should have already crippled her and sent her to a brothel. You can go to the brothel and look for her. Maybe you can find her.” Li Yingying said with a vicious expression.

Hearing this, Qin Yu’s face turned extremely cold.

Even though he knew that it was not true, he couldn’t stand Li Yingying’s vicious words.

Qin Yu raised his palm and struck through the air.

This slap actually reached out from the void in front of Li Yingying!

Without waiting for Li Yingying to react, the slap landed on her face!

Li Yingying, who was already disfigured, had half of her cheekbone shattered by the slap. Blood stained her clothes red, and her vicious face looked even more terrifying!

“It passed through the void. Qin Yu seems to have mastered the Spatial Power,” someone exclaimed.

“After all, he has stepped into the Reversion Void Stage. He had even defeated Yuan Xiu. It’s not unusual for him to master the Spatial Power.”

“Qin Yu is also a heaven’s favorite of the era. I wonder how he’s compared to Xiao Sheng.”

“It’s very difficult for anyone in this world to surpass Xiao Sheng, isn’t it?”

The crowd discussed spiritedly. They couldn’t help comparing the current Qin Yu with Xiao Sheng in the past.

Qin Yu looked at Li Yingying coldly and said, “Alright, I’ll do as you say. I’ll cripple your limbs soon and send you to the brothel.”

Li Yingying looked at Qin Yu angrily and said through her gritted teeth, “Qin Yu! I’ll definitely crush you into a thousand pieces. I promise!”

Qin Yu knew that Li Yingying was not the actual mastermind, so he looked at the people around her.

“Where is Jue Wu? Tell me, and I can spare your lives,” Qin Yu said coldly.

A long-bearded cultivator beside Li Yingying stepped forward and said indifferently, “You want to see Jue Wu? It’s very simple. She’s with the Tong family now. Come with us and naturally you’ll see her.”

“That’s right. Qin Yu, as long as you hand over what the young master wants, I think the young master will spare her life.”

“Qin Yu, don’t resist anymore. Come to the Tong family with us so that we don’t have to make a move.”

“Of course, I’ll go to the Tong family,” Qin Yu said coldly. “But not now. After I kill you all, I’ll definitely bring your corpses to the Tong family!”
