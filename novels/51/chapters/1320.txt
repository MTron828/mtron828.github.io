Chapter 1321: Chapter 1,321, strange creatures 

Chen Cang knew that he could no longer stop them, so he did not hide it anymore.

He said in a deep voice, “This mountain range is extremely strange. Once you step into it, everything in front of you will turn gray.”

Qin Yu and Wan ‘er did not dare to say anything more. They quietly listened to Chen Cang’s follow-up.

Chen Cang continued, “I don’t know what this aura is. I only know that it is extremely thick and heavy. It is like a huge mountain pressing on your chest. When you take a deep breath, you can even feel the heavy pressure on your chest.”

“Some people in Yang City have speculated about the aura in this mountain range. Some say that it’s chaotic qi, some say that it’s internal QI, but most people think that it’s demonic qi.”

Qin Yu immediately felt extremely surprised. He couldn’t help but ask, “Demonic qi? What is that?”

It wasn’t just Qin Yu. Even Wan ‘er and Ah San, who were natives of the Holy Region, didn’t know anything about it.

Chen Cang said slowly, “This is a name given by the locals of Yang City.”

AH SAN snorted, “It’s just an internal Qi. What’s so dangerous about it?”

Chen Cang glanced at Ah San, his eyes flashing with intense displeasure.

He snorted and said, “If it’s just this internal Qi, then there’s nothing dangerous about it. But do you know why the internal Qi in this mountain range is called Demonic Qi?”

“How would I know?”Ah San frowned.

At this moment, Qin Yu, who was at the side, noticed something unusual.

He touched his chin and said, “Could it be that... these internal Qi are hiding some strange creatures?”

“How do you know?”It was Chen Cang’s turn to be surprised.

Qin Yu pointed at the marks on the armor and said, “These marks seem to be left by some kind of sharp blade or claws. In addition, the name of this internal QI is very strange, so I’m guessing that this internal QI is hiding some creatures.”

“That’s right!”Chen Cang nodded.

“The creature inside is not worse than the ones in the Green Rock Forest. It’s even more terrifying than the demonic beasts in the outer area!”

“I once saw someone’s head crushed by a claw with my own eyes!”

“What’s more terrifying is that we can’t see its appearance clearly at all. We can only see a vague outline. It’s a creature that is flashing with a strange green light.”

At this point, Chen Cang pointed at the marks on the armor and said, “These creatures have different strengths. The deepest one almost scratched through the armor.”

Qin Yu could not help but squint his eyes and thought to himself, “I wonder if my desolate God’s eye can see through these creatures...”

“What?”Chen Cang asked.

Qin Yu waved his hand and said, “It’s nothing. Please continue.”

Chen cang grunted and said, “This mountain range is somewhat similar to the Green Rock Forest. The deeper you go, the more powerful that strange creature becomes.”

At this point, Chen Cang paused again.

His eyes swept over the three people and said coldly, “Do you know why someone guessed that this is the internal Qi of Chaos?”

“It must be because the aura here is extremely thick!”Ah San hurriedly shouted as if he wanted to show off in front of Wan ‘Er.

However, Chen Cang snorted coldly and said, “You can’t look at things only from the surface. If you can’t see through the essence, you will never have a great future.”

Hearing this, Ah San was immediately furious. He gritted his teeth and eventually endured it.

“Could it be... that this aura has a restriction on cultivation? Is it similar to the internal Qi?”Qin Yu guessed.

A smile appeared on Chen Cang’s face.

He looked at Qin Yu with admiration and said, “As expected of the person that Aileen has her eyes on. Not bad. This place is indeed similar to the internal Qi. It can also suppress one’s cultivation level. This is also the reason why I have been unwilling to let you step into it.”

Qin Yu became happier the more he heard.

His desolate God’s eye could see through almost everything. And now, he no longer had any spiritual energy in his body. He was relying on this body.

The horror of this mountain range seemed insignificant to Qin Yu.

Seeing the smile on Qin Yu’s face, Chen Cang frowned and said, “I’m saying this because I hope that you can turn back. It’s not too late to go back now.” Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Qin Yu smiled and said, “Old Mister Chen, thank you for your information, but we still want to go in and take a look.”

“That’s right!”Ah San hurriedly said.

Chen Cang sighed slightly. He waved his hand and said, “In that case, I have nothing more to say. But I suggest that you guys don’t try to be brave. When you see that things are not looking good, leave immediately.”

“Definitely.”Qin Yu bowed and said.

Chen Cang did not say anything more and immediately walked down the mountain.

Looking at this vast mountain range, Qin Yu’s heart was filled with anticipation.

If he could obtain life Qi from this, it meant that he could recover his strength.

At that time, all the problems would be solved.

“Miss Wan ‘er, after entering the mountain range, remember to follow behind me.”Qin Yu looked at Wan ‘er and said.

Ah San snorted coldly and said, “Follow behind you? Kid, you better take care of yourself.”

Qin Yu smiled and said, “If you’re afraid, I don’t mind you following behind me.”

“Hehe, I hope you won’t Pee in your pants when we enter this mountain range later,”ah San retorted.

After saying this, he grabbed Wan ‘er’s hand and said, “Miss, let’s go.”
