Chapter 1295: Chapter 1295, absorbing life force 

Turning around, he saw a heavenly demon ape staring coldly at Ling Yun. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

This demon ape was extremely terrifying, and its aura could be described as monstrous!

Anyone could tell that this demon ape wasn’t simple!

More importantly, it tore apart Ling Yun’s abnormal image effortlessly. This was enough to prove its terrifying strength!

“Idiot, I’m afraid that your heaven flipping seal has angered the demonic beasts here.”Qin Yu sneered.

“Damned Beast.”Ling Yun looked coldly at the heavenly demon ape with a hint of killing intent on his face.

He used the same trick again. He used the heaven flipping seal again and slapped it towards the heavenly demon ape.

However, the Heavenly Demon Ape immediately clenched its fist and smashed it towards Ling Yun.

The heaven flipping seal that Ling Yun used vanished instantly. That huge fist smashed directly onto Ling Yun’s body.

“Bang!”

Ling Yun was instantly smashed into the ground, creating a huge hole in the ground!

“Young Master!”His follower panicked upon seeing this and rushed over hurriedly.

He saw that Ling Yun’s body was on the verge of shattering as he spat out blood continuously!

“What a powerful demonic ape!”Qin Yu couldn’t help but give this demonic ape a thumbs up.

Qin Yu, who had always been famous for his physical body, felt as if he was nothing in front of the heavenly demon ape.

Such powerful strength showed the strength of this heavenly demon ape.

He had almost taken Ling Yun’s life with a single punch.

“Young Master Ling!”The attendant hurriedly carried Ling Yun out of the huge pit.

Ling Yun spat out blood continuously. He opened his mouth and spoke in a trembling voice. No one knew what he wanted to say.

At this moment, the huge heavenly demon ape didn’t stop there. Its pair of cold eyes became even more manic.

Even Ling Yun and the rest felt a deep sense of fear.

Qin Yu couldn’t help but sneer. “You guys should think about how to deal with this Heavenly Devil Ape First. I’ll retreat First!”

After saying this, Qin Yu disappeared without a trace in a few flashes.

“Don’t go, stop right there!”That Almighty was still roaring loudly.

However, this roar didn’t stop Qin Yu. Instead, it attracted the heavenly devil ape over.

He had no choice but to grit his teeth, pick up Ling Yun, and run.

Facing this heavenly demon ape, he had no way to resist. He could only flee.

Because Qin Yu didn’t have spiritual energy, he didn’t attract the heavenly demon ape.

He ran for tens of miles before stopping.

“That was close...”Qin Yu couldn’t help but Pat his chest.

If not for the appearance of the heavenly demon ape, he would probably be in deep trouble today.

This Ling Yun is really not simple, Qin Yu thought to himself.

Even though the two of them had only exchanged a few blows, it was enough to see through the strength of both parties.

“Forget about him. At least I’ve obtained the life force. I’ve earned it.”Qin Yu couldn’t help but grin.

However, his current physical condition was still very poor, and his brain was a little dizzy.

Therefore, Qin Yu planned to find a place to rest for a while.

After a few rounds of searching, Qin Yu found a cave, which he temporarily used as a shelter.

The environment of this cave was quite excellent. There was a small stream by the side, and from time to time, the sound of crashing could be heard.

After that, he lay in the cave and fell into a deep sleep.

On the other side, that mighty figure used almost all of his strength to escape from the hands of the heavenly demon ape with great difficulty.

But even so, his body was still heavily injured.

Looking at the two people covered in blood, the hunters of the hunter organization couldn’t help but be a little surprised. Jing Bai even frowned slightly.

He walked over quickly and asked coldly, “You guys went to Qingyan Forest?”

“Cut the crap!”The almighty shouted. “Where’s your pharmacist? Hurry up and save him!”

Jing Bai remained silent. Currently, Zhong Wu was in charge of the hunter organization. He couldn’t change anything.

Under Zhong Wu’s lead, the two of them were brought to the pharmacist’s room.

“What’s going on? How did Ling Yun get so badly injured?”Guan Zhuang walked over and muttered.

Jing Bai shook his head. “I don’t know. They must have barged into the depths of Green Rock Forest and angered some demonic beast.”

“Hehe, they deserve it! They should pay for their arrogance!”Guan Zhuang sneered.

Jing Bai remained silent. He was slightly worried.

Qin Yu was also hiding in the green rock forest. He was probably facing the same danger.

At this moment, Qin Yu was sleeping soundly in the cave.

After an unknown amount of time, he opened his eyes in a daze.

This sleep could be said to be refreshing.

“Fortunately, the poison of the flying spider isn’t that terrifying,”Qin Yu thought to himself.

He shook his head, and the feeling of fainting had completely disappeared. His injuries had also slightly recovered.

“Forget it. Let’s try the life Qi first.”Qin Yu took out the life Qi from the spatial magic artifact.

In the jar, traces of internal Qi were slowly flowing.

Qin Yu took a deep sniff, and his entire body felt comfortable.

“This is the feeling,”Qin Yu said while holding back his excitement.

“As long as I recover my spiritual power, I don’t have to be afraid of the Heavenly Cloud sect anymore,”Qin Yu said with a cold snort.

Then, he didn’t waste any more time and immediately began to absorb the internal Qi.

Traces of internal Qi flowed through Qin Yu’s pores and into his body.

The entire jar of internal Qi was disappearing at an extremely fast speed. In just a few moments, the internal Qi had been completely exhausted.
