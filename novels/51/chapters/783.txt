Chapter 784: Never Believed In You Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

If he got a little more Golden Cores, then there would be nothing lacking for cultivation.

‘If I can obtain the power of a Martial Saint, then I will go and exterminate the Purple Flame Sect. At that time, I will be able to obtain a lot of Golden Cores,’ Qin Yu thought to himself.

If he could exterminate all the forces in the vicinity, then it would be even more satisfying.

Qin Yu used the spiritual fire to finish off these few corpses, then he lay on the bed and fell asleep.

The next day.

Qin Yu came to the herbs warehouse again.

There were obviously fewer people coming to the herbs warehouse today, because most of them had already received the herbs.

When Qin Yu came to the herbs warehouse, Hou Xin was selecting herbs.

Qin Yu walked behind him and patted his shoulder while smiling. “What a coincidence.”

Hou Xin suddenly turned around and saw Qin Yu in front of him. A trace of surprise flashed across Hou Xin’s face.

“Mr. ... Mr. Qin, why are you here?” Hou Xin asked subconsciously.

Qin Yu smiled and said, “Of course I’m here to select herbs. What about you?”

Hou Xin smiled embarrassedly and said, “Me... me too.”

After saying that, he hurriedly selected a few herbs and left the place.

Looking at his departing back, Qin Yu couldn’t help but reveal a trace of a cold smile.

Today was the last day, and all the alchemists began to exert their strength.

Pill Clouds would gather in the manor from time to time. This was enough to show that many people had successfully refined a pill.

“I can’t waste any more time,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

He took out the medicinal cauldron, then dyed the spiritual fire in his hand and began to refine the pill.

In the evening, Qin Yu slowly opened his eyes.

He slowly stood up, and then a trace of spiritual energy flowed out from his palm.

This trace of spiritual energy slowly fell into the medicinal cauldron.

At this moment, Qin Yu’s pupils suddenly constricted, and he said in a low voice, “Success!”

“Boom!”

The entire room immediately erupted with a loud bang!

At the same time, a large patch of multicolored Pill Clouds condensed in the sky!

Such a Pill Cloud instantly attracted countless gazes!

Many people raised their heads and looked at the sky.

“What a beautiful Pill Cloud...” someone exclaimed.

“With such a Pill Cloud, it must be an extraordinary pill!”

“Looks like the Xue family manor really has an expert!”

The Pill Cloud condensed in the sky for a long time before gradually dissipating.

At the same time, a pill had already appeared in Qin Yu’s palm.

The Pill was pitch black, and it emitted a strange smell.

No matter how one looked at it, this pill didn’t seem like a Divine Rank pill.

“This is the concentric pill?” The man with the mustache leaned forward and asked.

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “No, I don’t have the pill formula for the concentric pill at all.”

“Then what is this?” The man with the mustache asked in puzzlement.

Qin Yu said indifferently, “It’s also a substitute.”

“Dispel poison pill?” The man with the mustache asked.

Qin Yu shook his head and didn’t answer.

He put away the pill and quietly waited for the arrival of tomorrow.

In the morning of the next day.

Many alchemists had gathered early in the square.

Qin Yu brought the man with the mustache and came to the square.

Three days ago, there were dozens of people in the square.

But today, there were only a dozen people left.

“Tsk. It seems that in these three days, there have been a lot of massacres,” Qin Yu sighed.

As he spoke, Qin Yu saw Hou Xin not far away.

He immediately walked in Hou Xin’s direction.

“Mr. Hou, have you finished refining the pill?” Qin Yu asked casually.

Hou Xin smiled embarrassedly and said, “Ah, I’ve successfully refined it. What about you?”

Qin Yu smiled and said, “The same goes for me. Can I take a look at your pill?”

Hou Xin’s expression changed, and he hurriedly shook his head and said, “My skills are clumsy, so I won’t take it out...”

Qin Yu smiled and didn’t force him.

The group of people stood on the square, waiting for the Xue family to arrive.

Ten minutes later.

The three siblings of the Xue family arrived on time.

Xue Yujie glanced at everyone and said indifferently, “Three days have passed. Congratulations on refining the pill.”

After saying this, Xue Yujie looked at Xue Yuzhi.

Xue Yuzhi immediately smiled and said, “Everyone, we will start collecting the pill now. Please hand over the pill in your hands.”

As soon as she finished speaking, the many alchemists took out the pill in their hands one after another.

Qin Yu wasn’t anxious. Instead, he stood below and waited quietly.

Hou Xin was the same. He closed his eyes and didn’t move for a long time.

“Mr. Hou, why haven’t you handed over the pill yet?” Qin Yu asked.

Hou Xin opened his eyes and smiled. “I’m not anxious.”

Qin Yu didn’t ask any more questions.

Above.

Xue Yuzhi received the pill from everyone, but her eyes kept flashing with disappointment.

“This isn’t the concentric pill.”

“What we want is the concentric pill. You’d better take this for yourself.”

“I’m sorry.”

One after another, the alchemists were sent back, and their faces were full of dejection.

Fortunately, the Xue family was still benevolent and righteous. Even if they couldn’t refine the concentric pill, they would still receive a large sum of money. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Soon, only Qin Yu and Hou Xin were left in the square.

“Mr. Qin, why aren’t you going?” Hou Xin asked in puzzlement.

Qin Yu smiled and said, “Don’t we both have the same pill? You gave me the prescription. Of course, I have to let you go first.”

Hou Xin chuckled and said, “That makes sense. That makes sense.”

After saying that, Hou Xin walked toward Xue Yuzhi.

Qin Yu immediately followed him.

At this moment, the three brothers of the Xue family seemed to have lost their patience.

Xue Yujie frowned and said, “Is that the concentric pill in your hand? If it’s not, there’s no need to take it out.”

Hou Xin smiled and said, “Whether it is or not, you’ll know after you see it.”

After saying that, Hou Xin flipped his palm, and a pill fell into his hand.

Xue Yuzhi took the pill and carefully observed it.

A trace of surprise flashed across her face, and in the end, she said excitedly, “It’s really a concentric pill! Brother, this is really a concentric pill!”

“Really?” Xue Yujie also hurriedly took it.

He carefully looked at it and exclaimed, “It really is a concentric pill!”

Hou Xin said proudly, “Of course!”

Qin Yu, who was at the side, frowned and said, “Mr. Hou, didn’t you say that you don’t have the pill formula and only have the pill formula for the dispel poison pill? You... lied to me?”

Hou Xin sneered and said, “Fool, do you think that I will tell you the truth? I gave you the pill formula for the dispel poison pill just to let your guard down!”

Qin Yu sighed and said, “Wen Sheng’s news was also deliberately released by you with the purpose of getting him killed, right?”

“Hehe, you can’t just say things like that.” Although Hou Xin didn’t admit it, his meaning was very obvious.

Qin Yu sighed and said, “Hou Xin, you really hid yourself well.”

Hou Xin said sarcastically, “This is called all is fair in war.”

“Yes, all is fair in war.” Qin Yu nodded slightly.

At this moment, a cold smile flashed across Qin Yu’s face.

“Fortunately, I didn’t believe your nonsense from the beginning.” Qin Yu grinned, revealing his mouth full of white teeth.
