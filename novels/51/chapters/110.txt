Liu Shihui looked coldly at the two henchmen and said, “The two of you can go in first.”

“Yes, Young Master.” The two henchmen nodded and then walked toward the door.

Yao Qing had no strength left to stop the two people. Although he was extremely anxious, there was nothing he could do. He could only watch helplessly as they walked over.

“Young Master Liu, the door is locked.” The henchman couldn’t help but frown as he walked to the door.

“Then break the door open for me!” Liu Shihui said furiously.

“Yes, Young Master.”

At this moment, Qin Yu was sitting in the room while refining the pills in his body.

The refining speed of the Qi Gathering Pill was far faster than Qin Yu had imagined. These pills turned into spiritual energy and flowed through his dantian to attack the various acupoints in his body.

A faint light surrounded Qin Yu’s body. This light also began to converge bit by bit and slowly gathered at the location of his dantian.

Time passed minute by second, and the sound of the door being smashed sounded.

However, Qin Yu seemed to be isolated from the outside world and couldn’t hear anything at all.

“Buzz!”

Finally, these pills were completely refined! The surging spiritual energy completely fused with Qin Yu’s body! Finally, a ray of light was formed in his dantian.

“Phew.”

Qin Yu’s eyes snapped open!

At this moment, a breeze blew around him!

A terrifying power was traveling around his body. Even his physical body became a few times tougher at this moment!

“Twenty-eight Qi Gathering Pill couldn’t help me break through to the Foundation Establishment Stage.” Qin Yu frowned slightly and murmured in a low voice.

Currently, Qin Yu was just at the peak of the Qi Refining Stage and was just a hair’s breadth away from the Foundation Establishment Stage.

“It seems that it’s not that easy to break through to the next level.” Qin Yu thought to himself.

Even with three herbs, he couldn’t even break through to the Foundation Establishment Stage. Who knew how many herbs he would have to spend to cultivate in the future?

Qin Yu couldn’t help but feel a trace of pressure.

“Fortunately, the speed is faster than I thought,” Qin Yu said in a low voice.

He thought it would take at least three days, but it only took him a dozen hours.

“Bang, bang!”

At this moment, the sound of the door being smashed came from the door again.

Then, Liu Shihui’s angry roar from the courtyard also reached Qin Yu’s ears.

After advancing to the peak of the Qi Refining Stage, Qin Yu’s hearing also improved by leaps and bounds, and the spiritual energy in his body was as vast as the sea.

“Someone came?” Qin Yu narrowed his eyes. He immediately walked to the door and pushed it open.

As soon as the door opened, he saw two henchmen standing at the door, and a short distance away, Yao Qing was hugging Liu Shihui’s thigh tightly.

When he saw this scene, Qin Yu’s expression instantly turned cold.

“Mr. Qin...” Yao Qing spat out a sentence with difficulty. Then, he fell to the ground and completely fainted. At this moment, his hand also loosened.

“Liu Shihui?” Qin Yu looked coldly at Liu Shihui. His expression was cold.

Liu Shihui said with a nonchalant smile, “Mr. Qin, I specially came from South City to visit you. I didn’t expect your subordinate to be so disrespectful, so I helped you teach him a lesson.”

Qin Yu glanced at Liu Shihui without saying anything.

He walked to Yao Qing first and put his hand on his chest to use spiritual energy to protect Yao Qing’s life.

Then, Qin Yu raised his head and looked at Liu Shihui coldly.

“What are you doing here?” Qin Yu’s tone was cold.

Liu Shihui didn’t care at all. He said with a nonchalant smile, “Qin Yu, I’m here to take back my things.”

“Your things?” Qin Yu couldn’t help but sneer.

“I don’t have your things here.”

Liu Shihui narrowed his eyes and said with a smile, “Qin Yu, don’t play dumb with me. Where’s the Chinese knotweed?” Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“It’s mine. What does it have to do with you?” Qin Yu snorted.

Liu Shihui’s expression turned cold again.

“Qin Yu, think about it carefully. Yan Ruoxue is no longer in Jiangcheng!” Liu Shihui shouted!

“So?” Qin Yu raised his eyebrows.

“So you should consider the consequences!” Liu Shihui said coldly.

Qin Yu looked at Liu Shihui and said indifferently, “I have already eaten that Chinese knotweed. If you want it, I can pull it for you.”

“You!” When he heard this, Liu Shihui’s expression instantly turned livid!

However, he didn’t take him seriously. He took a deep breath and said, “How about this, Qin Yu? I, Liu Shihui, am also a reasonable person.”

“In three days, you and I will have a public competition in South City. If I win, you will return the Chinese knotweed to me. How about that?” Liu Shihui said patiently.

Although Yan Ruoxue had already left Jiangcheng, Liu Shihui still didn’t want to take this risk.

If it was a public competition, even the Yan family couldn’t say anything.

“What if you lose?” Qin Yu asked back.

Liu Shihui said with a nonchalant smile, “If I lose, that Chinese knotweed will be yours. I won’t pester you!”

“That Chinese knotweed was mine to begin with. Are you out of your mind to use my belongings as collateral for a bet?” Qin Yu said coldly.

Liu Shihui’s expression changed, and he instantly felt a burst of anger in his chest!

He gritted his teeth and said while holding back his anger, “Then what do you think we should do?”

Qin Yu said coldly, “If you lose, you will kneel down and apologize to Yao Qing. You will also give me a herb king that is more than a hundred years old. What do you think?”

Liu Shihui was overjoyed! Without thinking, he immediately agreed. “Okay, it’s a deal!”

Liu Shihui didn’t take Qin Yu’s conditions seriously at all.

Because in his opinion, it was impossible for him to lose!

“Okay, I’ll look for you in three days,” Qin Yu said coldly.

“Qin Yu, I hope you’ll keep your word.” Liu Shihui snorted, waved his hand, and turned to leave.

“Wait.”

At this moment, Qin Yu suddenly called out to Liu Shihui.

Liu Shihui turned around and said with puzzlement, “Do you have anything else?”

Qin Yu slowly walked to Liu Shihui, suddenly raised his hand, and slapped the henchman’s face!

With this slap, the henchman’s face was directly shattered!

His entire face instantly collapsed! His body slid on the ground and he couldn’t stop vomiting blood!

“Number Two!” Another henchman hurriedly rushed up.

“Young Master Liu, Number Two is... He’s dead!” The other henchman’s expression was extremely ugly!

“Qin Yu, what the f * ck are you doing?!” Liu Shihui roared angrily.

Qin Yu said indifferently, “You hit my friend, so I’ll collect some interest.”

Liu Shihui’s expression was extremely ugly. No one had dared to act so insolent in front of him!

At this moment, Liu Shihui wanted nothing more than to tear Qin Yu apart!

“I only taught a lap dog a lesson for you, yet you killed my henchman! Qin Yu, you’re too ruthless!” Liu Shihui clenched his teeth and said.

Qin Yu looked at Liu Shihui coldly and said, “First of all, Yao Qing isn’t my lap dog, but my friend.”

“Second of all, this is just a little interest. Three days later, I will make you kneel in front of Yao Qing and apologize in person!”
