Chapter 336: Pavilion Master’s Return Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Feeling the spiritual energy in the storage room, Qin Yu couldn’t help but feel a little enticed.

There were several hundred-year-old herbs growing in the storage room.

Qin Yu swallowed hard and even had the thought of taking them all away.

Of course, Qin Yu was only thinking about it.

Plundering like this wasn’t in line with Qin Yu’s morals.

He took out a hundred herbs that had been around for decades, then turned around and walked out of the storage room.

“You guys, count them. There are a total of a hundred herbs.” Qin Yu placed the herbs in front of the two of them.

The two pharmacists hurriedly nodded and said, “Mr. Qin, you’d better register them.”

“Okay.” Qin Yu nodded and agreed.

He wrote down his name and the number of herbs on the paper, then put all these herbs into the Spatial Magic Artifact.

After returning to his residence, Qin Yu couldn’t wait to take out these herbs.

Looking at the herbs on the ground, Qin Yu couldn’t help but have the illusion that he was a rich man.

“Speaking of which, I don’t have any money in my card.” Qin Yu suddenly thought of a problem.

During this period of time, Qin Yu had spent a lot of money to retrieve the herbs.

The two billion in his bank account had already started to bottom out.

Therefore, Qin Yu took out his cell phone and called Lei Hu.

After the call was connected, Qin Yu asked, “How much money do I still have in my account?”

On the other end, Lei Hu hurriedly said, “Please wait a moment, I’ll go and check.”

A few minutes later, Lei Hu called back and said somewhat awkwardly, “Mr. Qin, the money in my account has been used to expand the company, so...”

“So how much more is there?” Qin Yu asked.

Lei Hu said in a deep voice, “Less than 300 million.”

“300 million...”

This amount was much less than he had imagined.

Although Qin Yu didn’t care about money, in this world, it was difficult to do anything without money.

Moreover, money was hard currency. If he encountered top-grade herbs one day, he might have to spend a huge amount.

“I got it.” Qin Yu hung up the phone.

He touched his chin and muttered in a low voice, “Looks like I have to think of a way to get money...”

Before he finished his sentence, the door was suddenly opened.

Then, he saw the Third Elder walk in angrily.

Beside him were two old men who looked dignified.

“Law Enforcement Elders, it’s him!” The Third Elder pointed at Qin Yu and said.

“Not only did he forcefully break into the storage room, but he also stole the herbs! Please punish him severely, Law Enforcement Elders!”

The two Law Enforcement Elders looked at Qin Yu coldly and said, “Who allowed you to forcefully break into the storage room?”

Qin Yu stood up and said politely, “Greetings, two Law Enforcement Elders.”

Then, Qin Yu told the Law Enforcement Elders what had happened.

“If it weren’t for the Third Elder forcefully seizing the herbs, I wouldn’t have stepped into the storage room rashly,” Qin Yu said with a bow.

“Don’t even think about framing me!” The Third Elder said with a derisive tone.

“It was clearly you who coveted the herbs and forced your way into the storage room.”

Qin Yu couldn’t be bothered with the Third Elder. He bowed and said, “Law Enforcement Elders, I only took hundreds of herbs that had medicinal effects for decades. This shouldn’t be against the rules, right?”

The Law Enforcement Elder said coldly, “No matter what the reason is, you shouldn’t force your way into the storage room.”

“Yes, yes, yes. He even beat Han Shixun, who came to take the pills!” The Third Elder shouted.

The Law Enforcement Elder looked at Qin Yu coldly and said, “Come with us.”

Qin Yu frowned. These two Law Enforcement Elders were at the peak of the Inner Strength Grandmaster realm. Qin Yu had almost no chance of winning against them. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“Please show mercy, Law Enforcement Elders!”

At this moment, the Fifth Elder rushed in.

Beside him were Yao Qing and Taozi.

The Fifth Elder walked forward quickly and explained, “Please show mercy, Law Enforcement Elders. All of this is the result of the Third Elder’s set up. It has nothing to do with Qin Yu.”

“Bullsh * t!” The Third Elder scolded angrily.

The Fifth Elder snorted and said, “You know very well whether it has anything to do with you or not.”

“What does it have to do with me? Let me tell you...”

“Enough!” The Law Enforcement Elder interrupted the quarrel between the two.

He glanced at Qin Yu and said, “No matter what the reason is, you aren’t permitted to enter the storage room. According to the rules, we must punish you. Come with us.”

The Fifth Elder wanted to say something, but was interrupted by Qin Yu with a wave of his hand.

He stood up and said, “Okay, I’ll go with you.”

Then, Qin Yu was taken away from the mansion by the two Law Enforcement Elders.

“Fifth Elder, what should we do? Will Mr. Qin be okay?” Yao Qing asked anxiously.

The Fifth Elder waved his hand and said, “The Pavilion Master will come back tomorrow. Let her make the decision.”

“Hehe, the Pavilion Master will definitely punish this kid who doesn’t know his place!” The Third Elder said with a derisive tone.

The Fifth Elder looked at the Third Elder coldly and said, “You will pay the price for what you have done.”

“Hahaha, I want to see how you will make me pay the price!” The Third Elder snorted coldly and then left with a flick of his sleeve.

...

Qin Yu was brought to a dark room by the Law Enforcement Elder.

The room looked shabby, but what surprised Qin Yu was that a formation was also set up here!

In this formation, Qin Yu’s strength was greatly suppressed. It was impossible for him to escape from here.

“Stay here first. The matter is complicated. We will make a decision when Pavilion Master comes back,” said one of the Law Enforcement Elders.

“Qin Yu, we have heard of your deeds and believe that you were framed. However, we have to follow the rules,” said the other Law Enforcement Elder.

It could be seen that they didn’t like the Third Elder either.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “I understand. Thank you, Elders.”

The two of them didn’t say anything more. They turned around and walked out.

To Qin Yu, this so-called cage was nothing. He would sleep wherever he was.

Moreover, the more harsh the environment was, the more it could train one’s willpower.

Qin Yu sat cross-legged on the ground and closed his eyes.

His state of mind became more and more stable, as if he was in his own world.

...

The next day was the day the Pavilion Master of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion returned.

And early in the morning, the two Law Enforcement Elders walked in.

“Qin Yu, you can go out, but don’t wander around. When the Pavilion Master returns, she will definitely summon you,” said the Law Enforcement Elder.

Qin Yu cupped his hands and said, “Thank you.”

After saying that, Qin Yu turned around and walked out of the cage.

At noon, all the pharmacists of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion, high-ranking and low-ranking, gathered in the square.

Under the leadership of the First Elder, the eight elders quietly waited for the return of the Pavilion Master.

“Kid, when the Pavilion Master comes back, I’ll see what you will do!” The Third Elder looked at Qin Yu with a gloomy expression.
