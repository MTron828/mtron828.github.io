Chapter 936: Chapter 936, Demon Beast City 

Beneath the abyss, there were traces of light.

This light was only the size of a grain of rice, but it was extremely dazzling and resplendent!

Not only that, although this grain of rice light was very small, the power contained within it was beyond imagination!

Qin Yu even felt that the power contained within this trace of light far surpassed the Martial Saint Stage!

“What on Earth is this thing?”Qin Yu could not help but widen his eyes.

He stared at that Ray of light and tried to shout, “Hey, is anyone there?”

However, other than Qin Yu’s echo, there was nothing else in the abyss.

“That’s not right.”Qin Yu scratched his head.

According to the words of the handlebar mustache, this should be a spiritual sense.

In other words, this thread of light definitely had its own thoughts.

Qin Yu continued to shout, “Is anyone there? If anyone is there, say something!”

That thread of light still did not move.

Qin Yu touched his chin and muttered, “Could it be that you are putting on an act with me?”

Qin Yu stretched out his palm. He originally wanted to jump into the abyss to take a good look, but he was afraid that his spiritual sense would be swallowed by this thread of light.

After thinking about it, Qin Yu didn’t dare to go down in the end.

His divine sense returned to his body from the spatial artifact and then looked at the handlebar mustache.

Qin Yu told the handlebar mustache everything he saw in the spatial artifact.

“You mean... that thread of light contains extremely powerful power?”The handlebar mustache asked.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “Yes, even when he was facing star seizer, he didn’t feel this kind of pressure.”

“Then it must be the spiritual sense,”the mustached man muttered.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “I think so too, but he doesn’t want to talk to me.”

“He doesn’t want to talk to you,”the mustached man rolled his eyes and said.

“If it’s really as powerful as you say, then in his eyes, you’re just an ant.”

“Who wants to talk to an ant?”

Qin Yu nodded slightly, as if he felt that the moustache made sense.

“This thing was obtained from Luo Jingyu. I have to go back and ask him when I have time,”Qin Yu thought to himself.

Although that was the case, Qin Yu did not give up. He decided to find time to test this glimmer of light.

Then, Qin Yu and the moustache set off on their journey again.

“I have been training for so long. I think it’s time for me to go into closed door cultivation.”Qin Yu thought to himself.

Now that he had obtained the freedom divine stone and the Qi/spiritual energy from the second mystery realm, he would most likely have the chance to become a martial saint.

After Qin Yu decided to walk out of this desert, he tried to go into closed door cultivation to break through.

The two of them walked for another two whole days.

Finally, a city appeared before the two of them.

Walls had been erected around the city, making it look extremely tall.

And judging from the style of the buildings, it did not seem like it belonged to the fire country.

“But there’s finally someone here.”The handlebar moustache muttered.

Qin Yu released his divine sense, attempting to cover the entire city.

But when Qin Yu’s divine sense touched the city, it was swiftly severed.

“Eh?”Qin Yu frowned slightly.

This city had actually laid down a formation capable of isolating divine sense?

“It seems that this city isn’t simple,”the mustached man thought.

Qin Yu nodded slightly. “Correct. To be able to lay down a city in such an environment, he definitely isn’t an ordinary person.”

“Should we go in?”The mustached man asked.

“Since we’re already here, even if it’s a dragon’s Den or a tiger’s den, we still have to go in and take a look,”Qin Yu said.

Thus, the two of them strode to the vicinity of the main city.

There was no one guarding the entrance. Qin Yu and the moustache man easily walked in.

After stepping in, Qin Yu instantly felt a trace of abnormality.

Although he did not know where the abnormal internal Qi came from, he somehow felt a sense of familiarity.

“Demonic Beast?”The mustached man whispered.

After hearing the mustached man’s words, Qin Yu patted his head and said, “Yes, I have felt this strange aura on little black before.”

The mustached man was not as optimistic as Qin Yu.

He said with a gloomy face, “This internal QI is probably only found in heaven-rank demonic beasts.”

“And then?”Qin Yu did not take it seriously.

The mustached man hurriedly waved his hand and said, “Retreat, quickly leave this place!”

After saying this, the mustached man turned around and left.

Qin Yu followed behind him and asked as he walked, “Why Are You So Nervous?”

The mustached man said coldly, “Demonic beasts are hostile towards humans, but this heaven rank demonic beast built a city in an uninhabited place. This is enough to prove that he is not friendly towards humans.”

“Moreover, once the Heaven Rank Demonic Beast is formed, its strength will definitely exceed our imagination. It is not something that we can fight against.”

As they spoke, the two of them strode out of the city.

Unfortunately, even if the two of them hurried over, they still did not have the time.

At the entrance, two figures appeared.

These two people’s strength were actually at the half-step martial Saint Stage!

The city gate was slowly closed. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

These two people emitted a strong hostility.

“Who let you in?”The two people said coldly.

The mustached man frowned slightly and cupped his hands, “Senior, we didn’t mean any harm. We just intruded unintentionally. Please forgive us.”

“Intruded unintentionally? This is a deserted place. How could we intrude unintentionally!”One of them said coldly.

The other person took a step forward and said coldly, “I think you have bad intentions. Come with us to see the City Lord!”

Qin Yu frowned and said, “Friend, we really didn’t mean it. Please let us leave.”

“Cut the crap!”One of them raised his hand and grabbed Qin Yu’s shoulder!

Seeing that it did not make sense, Qin Yu could only shout and grab his wrist!

“Friend, must this be the case?”Qin Yu said coldly.

“Half-step martial saint? As expected, he is not a good person!”The other party shouted loudly.

“Do it, kill him!”

As the two people shouted, more than ten figures instantly appeared around them!

What was shocking was that these people were all at the half-step martial Saint Realm!

Qin Yu and the mustached man looked at each other and said in a low voice, “What should we do?”

“Since things have come to this, what else can we do? Think of a way to break out!”The moustache man said coldly.

As he spoke, the moustache man’s internal Qi was rapidly increasing!

This was the first time Qin Yu had seen the moustache man so serious!

This was enough to show the degree of danger in this place!

“What a powerful internal Qi.”After sensing the internal Qi of the moustache man, Qin Yu could not help but be shocked!

This internal Qi was probably not weaker than his!

The mustached man had indeed been hiding his strength!

“Boom!”

At this moment, one of them reached out to grab Qin Yu’s head!

Qin Yu did not hesitate anymore. He roared furiously and golden light erupted from his entire body!

The internal Qi of a half-step martial saint instantly erupted!
