After he killed these two people, Qin Yu’s anger didn’t dissipate at all.

He quickly walked in front of Yan Ruoxue and stretched out his hand to break the rope on Yan Ruoxue’s body.

Yan Ruoxue’s face was somewhat pale. It wasn’t because she was kidnapped, but because of the two corpses.

Only then did Qin Yu remember that he should not have killed people in front of Yan Ruoxue.

But at that time, he had already been blinded by anger, so how could he have thought of it?

“Are you okay?” Qin Yu blocked Yan Ruoxue’s view to prevent her seeing the corpses.

Yan Ruoxue shook her head and said, “I’m fine.”

“That’s good. Let’s go home.” Qin Yu bent down, then carried Yan Ruoxue in his arms and walked down the mountain.

Lying in Qin Yu’s arms, Yan Ruoxue felt extremely safe.

She looked up at Qin Yu’s face and couldn’t help but smile.

This kind of warm feeling made Yan Ruoxue, a tough and haughty woman, feel demure.

They walked all the way down the mountain. Qin Yu carried Yan Ruoxue into the car and then rushed to the Yan family’s manor.

“Miss Yan, this is all my fault. I promise that it won’t happen again,” Qin Yu said in a deep voice as he drove.

Yan Ruoxue smiled and said, “This wasn’t your fault to begin with. If you want to blame someone, blame them for being too bold.”

Qin Yu sighed. He didn’t know what to say.

“Miss Yan, tell your bodyguards to go back. I don’t need protection,” Qin Yu said with a slight sigh.

Hearing this, Yan Ruoxue couldn’t help but feel a little surprised.

“What a blabbermouth.” Then, Yan Ruoxue couldn’t help but mutter in a low voice.

The car arrived at the Yan family’s manor soon after.

At this time, the top bigwigs of Jiangcheng had gathered in the Yan family’s manor.

They looked anxious and had mixed feelings.

If something happened to Yan Ruoxue in Jiangcheng, it would be troublesome to deal with!

“Miss Yan is back!” At this moment, someone shouted and everyone rushed towards Yan Ruoxue.

“Miss Yan, are you alright? You scared us to death!”

“I promise to investigate Jiangcheng’s safety issues immediately!”

“I will send someone to protect Miss Yan 24/7 later!”

Everyone spoke one after another with lingering fear.

Yan Ruoxue waved her hand and said, “You guys can go back. I’m a little tired and want to rest.”

“This...” everyone looked at each other without knowing what to do.

“Miss Yan asked you guys to leave, so you guys can go.” The secretary waved his hand and said.

Hearing this, everyone left one after another.

After they all left, the secretary looked at Qin Yu and snorted lightly. “Fortunately, Miss Yan is fine.”

Qin Yu ignored him. He looked at Yan Ruoxue and said, “Miss Yan, you should rest early. I won’t disturb you.”

“Where are you going?” Yan Ruoxue called out to Qin Yu.

Qin Yu’s back was facing Yan Ruoxue. He took a deep breath and said, “Nowhere. I should go home and rest.”

After saying this, Qin Yu walked out of the Yan family’s manor quickly.

“Hmph, what a rascal. He’s going to go home and rest just like that? How rude.” The secretary couldn’t help but snort.

Yan Ruoxue glanced at him and said, “Do you really think he wants to go home?”

The secretary was stunned and quickly asked, “Miss Yan, what do you mean by that?”

Yan Ruoxue didn’t answer, but sighed slightly and said, “Call the higher-ups to ensure Qin Yu’s safety and get someone to clean up the aftermath.”

The secretary hesitated for a moment and quickly reacted.

Qin Yu wasn’t going home at all. He was going to find the culprit!

“Miss Yan, I might not need to summon anyone.” The secretary shook his head. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“I have already told the Master, who was furious when he heard the news and has already informed all personnel in the Chuzhou region. They sent a special forces team to Jiangcheng.”

Hearing this, Yan Ruoxue couldn’t help but frown.

“Shut up!” Yan Ruoxue shouted in a cold voice.

The secretary didn’t dare to make a sound.

Yan Ruoxue couldn’t help but rub her smooth forehead in fustration.

“Miss Yan, who is the culprit behind this?” A moment later, the secretary walked forward and asked tentatively.

Yan Ruoxue didn’t answer this question, but she already had the answer in mind.

It was definitely not Zhao Gang, who the gangsters mentioned, but someone else.

...

At this moment, Qin Yu was rushing towards the Zhao family.

The Zhao family lived in Dragon Paradise, the same neighborhood as Qin Yu did.

At this moment, Zhao Gang was pacing back and forth in his room.

“Honey, what exactly happened? Why do I have a bad premonition?” Su Yan said with a frown.

Zhao Gang didn’t say anything, but he was terrified.

He called the two gangsters twice, but they couldn’t get through.

“Please don’t let anything happen,” Zhao Gang murmured in a trembling voice.

At this moment, figure suddenly flashed through the door.

Zhao Gang, who was already nervous, jumped up in alarm.

“Who is it?! Who’s outside?!” Zhao Gang shouted.

It was silent outside the door.

“Honey, who’s there? Aren’t you a little too paranoid?” Su Yan muttered.

Zhao Gang wiped the sweat from his forehead and said in a low voice, “I hope so...”

“Kacha!”

At this moment, the door of the room was violently smashed open!

Then, a man stepped in!
