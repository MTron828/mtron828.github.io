2521 The Power of the Primordial Chaos

Three supremely high-end energies surged into Qin Yu’s dantian at a tremendous speed. In an instant, energy burst like a nuclear explosion erupted from the dantian.

“Retreat!”

At this moment, the expressions of the three persons beyond the fifth level changed drastically almost simultaneously.

They attacked concurrently, sending everyone 100,000 meters away.

Qin Yu’s head raised uncontrollably. The terrifying energy lifted his body high in the sky.

His eyes were bloodshot, and the energy surged through his body, impacting every part of it.

Every part of his body was reduced to nothingness.

However, when the body ashes dissipated, the power of meditation forcefully pulled them back.

As they reformed the body, the Heart of the Ocean was as if sensing Qin Yu’s danger.

It released the utmost energy fluctuations and extracted Qin Yu’s life force to stabilize Qin Yu’s core at the same time.

The Heart of the Ocean used this to buy some time, allowing Qin Yu’s power of meditation more time to restore the body.

Qin Yu panted heavily. A large amount of blood would flow from his mouth whenever he panted.

The muscles on his body trembled violently.

Without the Heart of the Ocean and the power of meditation, his body would have instantly turned into ashes. This kind of violent energy was not something that the human power could control.

In an instant, his body underwent hundreds of cycles of destruction and rebirth, hovering between existence and non-existence.

The violent energy repelled all the divine sense that approached him.

As the energy of the Primordial Chaos surged in his body, his body emitted waves of terrifying sound like a roar from hell and a low groan from a demon.

Even from 100,000 meters away, the spectating human race felt an immense sense of unease from the depths of his soul.

Primordial Chaos!

Qin Yu poured all his strength into Evil Eye and then aimed a strike toward that pitch-black stellar black hole.

Elemental Black Hole!

Qin Yu could only muster all his strength to push out the power of Primordial Chaos with Evil Eye. After that, his body was like a small boat sailing in a hurricane.

His divine sense and body were totally out of his control. The power of destruction was swaying.

Qin Yu seemed to have discovered a change in the void amidst this violent power.

The distant sky was densely covered with an almost imperceptible layer of barrier.

This barrier was like an illusion embedded in the sky. It was like a crystal clear immortal curtain that blocked the probing and spying of the outside world.

Before this, Qin Yu had never noticed this layer of seal.

At this moment, after the three elemental energies combined, a portion of the destructive power flowed into the desolate divine eye, and that was how he noticed the barrier.

However, this feeling only lasted a moment. Qin Yu and Si Shiyue were affected by the terrifying power.

However, at this moment, the destructive energy resulting from his clash with Shi Shiyue just froze in place.

Time was as if coming to a standstill.

The destructive power emitted by the clash between the Elemental Black Hole and the Primordial Chaos was clearly visible before them at this moment.

“That’s all for today.”

Su Xinghe’s figure suddenly appeared between the two. The power entered his body like a rainbow as he appeared.

The night faded, and the weather returned to normal as if the battle just now had never happened.

It was the might of a cultivator beyond the fifth level!

Qin Yu’s face was full of shock. The clash of two extreme forces before Su Xinghe was merely like child’s play.

Not only did he devour them, but Qin Yu also felt the time had reversed.

Most of the impacts of the fierce battle just now had recovered.

Just now, he had used the power of meditation and the utmost power of the Heart of the Ocean to withstand the power of the Primordial Chaos.

Much of his life force had been extracted by the Heart of the Ocean. At this moment, he felt that the life force had returned to his body, and he had no idea how Su Xinghe made the move.

“Go back. We already know your plans. If you want to go to purgatory, we will escort you. If a sixth-level alien race attacks, we will immediately sense it. This period is also an opportunity for our human race.”

As Su Xinghe finished speaking, Qin Yu felt a rune-like mark appear in his soul.

This mark seemed to have been made of countless runes and deeply embedded in his sea of soul like a nail.

It seemed to be afraid of the power involved.

“Don’t worry. It’s the mark of my soul. I can instantly appear from this mark if any high-level alien race attacks.”

Su Xinghe said softly.

“Thank you, Holy Lord Su!” Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Qin Yu was immensely grateful to this Holy Lord of Kunlun.

At the same time, Qin Yu felt a gaze fall on him. He raised his head and saw that it was indeed Revered Qi’s gaze.

There was an unconcealed killing intent in his divine sense. It was as if he would not be happy if he did not kill him.

“Holy Master Su, can I ask you a question?”

Qin Yu frowned slightly. After hesitating a moment, he sent a voice transmission to Su Xinghe.

“You want to ask why Revered Qi is targeting you?”

Qin Yu nodded. It seemed that the other two persons had also noticed it.

“Qin Yu. it’s a different world for those above the fifth level. You will only understand deeper when you break through. The world of saints is more particular about the distribution of benefits, much like in a primeval forest where the mightiest beasts are fewer in number but possess superior strength. That’s all I can tell you. As for the rest, you’ll have to figure it out yourself.”

Su Xinghe said softly and held Qin Yu with one hand.

In an instant, his body shot out like a sharp sword and disappeared into the void.

In the blink of an eye, he and Qin Yu arrived at Human Race Watch.

“Thank you, Holy Lord Su, for sending me off.”

Qin Yu cupped his hands and bowed slightly to this Holy Lord.

“Although the human race is in a precarious state now, the sixth-level saints are still entangled in various interests. I’m only doing my best to preserve some embers. Who can predict the future?”

Su Xinghe disappeared after he finished speaking.

However, Qin Yu felt a deep sense of helplessness from him.

Following Su Xing He’s departure, everyone finally reacted.

After hearing everything that had happened to Qin Yu, everyone finally understood that such a thing had happened in the past few days when Qin Yu was away.

“Revered Qi is a Saint of the human race but actually handles matters in such an unfair manner without fearing making people feel disheartened.”

Lei Xin said coldly.
