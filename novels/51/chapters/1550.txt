Chapter 1551: Chapter 1,551, Alchemist 1 Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

As the old man raised his hand, a huge pressure suddenly appeared!

Qin Yu felt as if his body was suddenly under an extremely powerful pressure. The huge pressure almost crushed Qin Yu’s body!

“Crack, crack, crack!”

Crisp sounds could be heard coming from all over his body. Every bone in his body seemed to be under pressure! His body was even flattened, as if it was going to explode at any moment!

At this moment, Qin Yu’s body emitted a golden light. All of his strength burst forth at this moment, desperately resisting this pressure!

However, this pressure was too great. Even if Qin Yu exerted his strength to the extreme, he still felt an extremely powerful pressure!

“Ah! ! !”

Qin Yu raised his head and roared angrily. Golden Light appeared all over his body as he tried his best to resist this pressure!

“Oh?”

The elder not far away could not help but raise his eyebrows when he saw this.

He narrowed his eyes and said in a low voice, “So it’s a chaotic body... I haven’t seen a chaotic body in a long time. Interesting.”

With that, he increased the strength in his hands once again!

Qin Yu, who was already unable to withstand the pressure, began to bleed at this moment!

......

Blood flowed out of every pore of his body. His physical body was about to be unable to withstand the pressure!

“Ah! !”

Qin Yu let out an angry roar and activated his cosmic form!

Under the power of the cosmic form, Qin Yu was finally able to hold on for the time being!

Seeing this, a smile appeared on the face of the elder not far away.

“Interesting,”the elder said indifferently.

In the next second, he withdrew this power and stroked his beard as he looked in Qin Yu’s direction.

In an instant, the power that was lingering around Qin Yu’s body disappeared without a trace.

Qin Yu was panting heavily. His entire body was dyed in blood, and he felt a lingering fear in his heart.

“What a terrifying power...”Qin Yu muttered in a low voice.

At this moment, the old man’s figure suddenly disappeared!

Before Qin Yu could react, he had already arrived in front of Qin Yu!

“What speed!”This shocked Qin Yu greatly!

At this moment, Qin Yu knew clearly in his heart that this old man in front of him was definitely not someone he could resist!

“Senior, I am an alchemist. It is only because I like alchemy that I followed behind you. I wish to spy on you. Please forgive me, Senior!”Qin Yu hurriedly explained.

He understood that there was only death if he fought head-on!

“Alchemist? oh? You are also an alchemist?”The old man said with slight surprise.

Qin Yu hurriedly nodded and said, “That’s right!”

In order to prove himself, Qin Yu flipped his palm, and the purple-colored spiritual fire immediately jumped onto his palm!

“En? Purple-colored spiritual fire?”Seeing this scene, the old man couldn’t help but be a little surprised.

Qin Yu hurriedly nodded and said, “Senior, I am indeed an alchemist. Please forgive me, Senior...”

The old man stroked his beard and said indifferently, “Purple-colored spiritual fire is rare in the South Province.” DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

It was not an exaggeration to say that in the entire South Province, Qin Yu was probably the only person who possessed purple-colored spiritual fire!

Qin Yu looked at the old man in front of him and was extremely nervous. He was afraid that the old man would slap him to death if he was unhappy.

“Chaotic body and purple spiritual fire. I think you are less than a hundred years old,”the old man said.

Qin Yu quickly said, “Senior, I am only thirty-five years old.”

“Thirty-five?”

Hearing this, the old man was shocked!

Thirty-five years old was not a very young age among ordinary people.

But if it was in the cultivation world, it was probably just the beginning!

“A thirty-five year old chaotic body is not only powerful, but also possesses a purple-colored spiritual fire. Interesting.”The old man said in surprise.

Qin Yu could not stop complaining in his heart. He could not understand the old man’s thoughts at all.

There were many mistakes in what he said. Qin Yu simply did not say a word and waited for the old man’s follow-up.

At this moment, the old man stretched out his palm and a ten-thousand-year-old herb landed in front of Qin Yu.

“Since you said that you are an alchemist, then refine a pill for me to see on the spot,”the old man said indifferently.

Qin Yu did not even think and hurriedly nodded. “May I ask what pill senior wants me to refine?”

“Refine the highest-level pill that you can refine,”the old man said.

Qin Yu thought for a moment. The most advanced pill he could refine at the moment was the nine transformation golden pill.

Therefore, Qin Yu asked tentatively, “Senior, can I refine the nine transformation Golden Pill?”

“Nine Transformation Golden Pill? Interesting.”The old man’s eyes became more and more surprised.

After thinking for a moment, he said, “If it’s the nine transformation Golden Pill, I’m afraid the herbs in front of you are not enough. You can refine an Earth rank pill.”

“Okay.”Qin Yu quickly nodded and agreed.

He immediately took out the medicinal cauldron from the spatial magic artifact and then planned to refine a pill.

The moment he saw the medicinal cauldron in front of Qin Yu, a trace of surprise flashed in the old man’s eyes, but he didn’t say anything.

The reason why he let Qin Yu refine a pill in front of him was obviously not to verify whether Qin Yu was lying or not.

For someone who possessed the purple spiritual fire, refining the pill was naturally not a problem.

He just wanted to see Qin Yu’s pill-refining level.

Qin Yu did not waste any time and immediately began to refine the pill.

After thinking about it, Qin Yu decided to refine the mystic yin pill.

This was a high-grade Earth rank pill, and the herbs required were not many. It just happened to meet the requirements of this old man.

The current Qin Yu had already stepped into the mighty realm. Whether it was his primordial spirit or his ability to control flames, both had a qualitative improvement.

Therefore, the mystic yin pill was not difficult for Qin Yu.

However, Qin Yu was a little nervous at the moment, so the process of refining the pill was much slower.

The whole process took about three hours before a mystic yin pill was formed in the cauldron.

Qin Yu took out the pill from the cauldron and handed it to the old man.

“Senior, this pill is called...”

“I know that this is the mystic Yin Pill.”The old man did not take it.

Qin Yu nodded slightly and explained, “Because I am a little nervous, the process of refining the pill is much slower.”

The old man heard this and asked, “Under normal circumstances, how long will it take to refine the mystic Yin Pill?”

Qin Yu thought for a moment and then said, “At most one and a half hours.”

“One and a half hours?”This surprised the old man.

Qin Yu grunted and said, “An hour and a half is enough.”

The old man sized up Qin Yu from head to toe, the expression on his face was extremely interesting.

He was sometimes puzzled, sometimes surprised, and sometimes pleasantly surprised.

In the end, he laughed out loud and said, “I really didn’t expect that this small southern region actually has such a pill refining genius like you!”

Qin Yu kept smiling embarrassedly, not daring to speak a word.

At this moment, the old man flipped his palm, and a ball of purple spiritual fire appeared in his hand.

However, his flames were much thicker and heavier than Qin Yu’s.

“Senior, you are also an alchemist?”Qin Yu asked in surprise.

The old man laughed out loud and said, “Why? Don’t I look like one?”

Qin Yu hurriedly shook his head and said, “No, I’m just a little surprised... there don’t seem to be too many alchemists in this southern region.”

“When did I say that I’m from the Southern Region?”The old man said faintly.
