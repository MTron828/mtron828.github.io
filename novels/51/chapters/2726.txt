“As for the other details, I’ll explain them to you in detail when we reach the place. I want you to come out safely and obtain the inheritance anyway.”

Ju Feng shrugged.

The corners of Qin Yu’s mouth curled into a cold smile. Yellow-tooth didn’t tell the truth.

They had probably sent people down before but they had failed to break through the tomb.

They were only the second batch of people to experiment. One had to know that many tombs needed specific conditions to open.

One had to meet even more stringent conditions to obtain something unless the tomb chose oneself.

Otherwise, one could only use the others’ lives to obtain all the things inside.

The reason why Qin Yu did not leave was because he felt very strange.

It was as if there was some kind of power summoning him here. This feeling was very mysterious.

It seemed to have happened since they stepped into the vicinity of Lingxu City. Qin Yu simply agreed to Yellow-tooth to verify his guess.

“Hey, Yellow-tooth! Slow down. There’s a strange spatial fluctuation here.”

A chubby man frowned and said.

There seemed to be a different internal qi here.

Although it was a straight road, Ju Feng’s figure would suddenly be covered. After passing through that area, his figure would appear again.

This wasn’t fog, and neither any energy fluctuation was here. It was as if everything was natural.

Was the space distorted? What kind of power was this? It could even distort space.

Qin Yu gasped.

The space should quickly recover after distortion but this place was frozen.

In other words, the power hidden here was even stronger than the recovery power of the entire space.

The Nine Heavens Manifestations Gaze on Qin Yu’s forehead parted the fog.

Through that endless space, Qin Yu seemed to see some distorted energy.

All of a sudden, his Nine Heavens Manifestations Gaze felt an intense pain.

Qin Yu was instantly shocked as if a needle had suddenly pierced into him. He instantly withdrew all his strength.

What a strange place! It seemed to have been discovered by one of the tombs. Could there be living things inside?

A shrill scream suddenly came from the thin woman’s mouth.

“What’s wrong with you?”

Another man with a cold expression shouted coldly. His eyes revealed a sinister light.

“Look!”L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

The thin and tall woman pointed ahead and said with a terrified expression.

As they walked through the distorted space ahead, a twisted corpse appeared in front of them. It was the young man who had left earlier. “Did you attack him? You have to give us an explanation!”

The tall and thin woman roared in fear.

This man’s strength was not low. Previously, Qin Yu had checked and found a particularly strong Dharma Treasure internal qi on him.

His overall strength was much stronger than the big guy before. Even his panic was probably fake.

However, he died.

Qin Yu’s gaze stopped on the wind chime in the young man’s hand. It should be a powerful defensive Dharma Treasure.

But why wasn’t it triggered? A Dharma Treasure of this level would be triggered even if it met someone with peak power.

A Holy Consciousness top-notch martial artist wouldn’t attack such a small fry.

Qin Yu looked at the distorted space and had a vague judgment in his heart.

“I don’t think I need to give you guys any explanation. This is Lingxu City. Countless senior’s divine souls are watching us in these places. The consequences of breaking the agreement are very serious. I’ll say it again. If anyone wants to leave, I won’t stop you.”

Yellow-tooth chuckled. He skillfully put the young man’s corpse into his ring and continued to move forward. It was as if the one who died was just an insignificant dog.

However, no one dared to leave at this time.

The remaining three people were a fat man, a man with vicious eyes, and a thin and tall woman.

Soon, Qin Yu and the others arrived at their destination.

Two other people were waiting there. When they saw Yellow-tooth, their faces were filled with shock.

“Why are there only so few people?”

“There’s no other way. There are too many tombs. I’ve been waiting for half a day and only these few have appeared.”

“Cut the crap. Let’s start.”

Yellow-tooth’s companion said with some dissatisfaction.

Three on the left, four on the right, seven on the Qian, and ten on the Kun.

The four crystal ores were directly sent to these four locations by Yellow-tooth.

Hmm?

Qin Yu frowned slightly. It seemed that as the four streams of energy entered, the internal qi of the space also began to change.

His two companions waited for the space to transform before sending in the internal qi to the four directions again.

Then, the space here changed again. The originally distorted space returned to normal.

It was a two-dimensional space unlocking. This guy was quite something.

Qin Yu nodded secretly. He had once studied array formations with Wang Feng.

Although his attainments weren’t deep, he still had some vision.

These three people were outsiders who had lived here for many years. They were very familiar with the way they dispelled formations.

The remaining person carefully took out a bottle.

After he stood in a certain position, the bottle was crushed in his hand.

A fishy smell of blood immediately spread out.

Then, something strange happened. The blood that flowed from the man’s palm began to flow back into the air.

It disappeared about a hundred meters above the ground as if someone had drunk it.

Then, a mountain peak emitting a gloomy internal qi suddenly appeared.

The people gasped. No one could imagine how this mountain peak was hidden in this space.

“Guys, stop wasting time. Can we go in now?”

Da Huang Ya revealed a sinister smile. That smile was like that of a poisonous snake.

“Are there any taboos inside? You have to tell us first.”

The fatty looked at the cave emitting evil qi and could not muster up the courage to enter.

“Just get in there!”

One of them moved like lightning, lifting the fatty with one hand and throwing him into the cave.

Fifteen minutes later, Yellow-tooth’s gaze fell on the tall and thin woman.

“It’s your turn. Do you want to go in yourself or should I help you?”

“I’ll go in myself!”

The thin and tall woman gritted her teeth and turned around to walk in around to walk in.

The strange thing was that both the fatty and the thin and tall woman did not make a sound after entering the cave. It was as if the cave had isolated all the information.

“It’s time.”

Yellow-tooth looked at Qin Yu.

“Are you sure you want me to go in? There are no restrictions here.”

Qin Yu stared at Yellow- tooth with a faint smile.

The remaining two people’s expressions changed drastically when they heard this.

They stared at Qin Yu and suddenly became somewhat vigilant..
