Chapter 468: Saint Confucian Sect Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

As he looked at the content of the video, Yan Sihai’s expression was a little unnatural.

“Mr. Yan, Qin Yu is already out of our control,” the military advisor said from the side. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Yan Sihai took a puff of his cigar and snorted. “His improvement speed is indeed faster than I imagined.”

“It’s not just the improvement speed.” The military advisor shook his head.

“Most importantly, he defeated a half-step Martial Marquis with the strength of an Inner Strength Grandmaster.”

Yan Sihai didn’t say anything.

He was also a martial artist, so he naturally knew what the difference between a peak Inner Strength Grandmaster and a half-step Martial Marquis meant.

“If he steps into the half-step Martial Marquis realm, the consequences will be unimaginable.” The military counselor sighed slightly.

Yan Sihai glanced at the military counselor and snorted coldly. “So what if he has talent in martial arts? He is just a martial artist.”

“In this era, it’s no longer the era where martial arts reigns supreme. As long as I move my fingers, I can kill him at any time!”

This was the power of wealth. In this era, even if you had great abilities, it would be difficult to compete with wealth.

The military advisor sighed slightly and said, “President Yan, I don’t deny it. Now Qin Yu, is indeed not powerful enough to threaten the position of the Yan family.”

“But have you ever thought about what will happen if he steps into the half-step Martial Marquis realm? If he steps into the Martial Marquis Realm, who in the world can hurt him?”

Yan Sihai sneered and said, “Did you not understand what I said? I said, in this era, a martial artist cannot achieve anything!”

The military advisor was silent for a moment, then said, “If he steps into the half-step Martial Marquis realm, he will definitely attract the attention of the Military District.”

“If the Military District gives him an official position, the Yan family will have to think twice before touching him.”

Yan Sihai didn’t say anything.

Just as the military advisor said, if Qin Yu really became an official, then it wouldn’t be easy to touch him.

“Do you have any good ideas?” Yan Sihai glanced at the military advisor and asked.

The military advisor said, “Miss’ wedding day is imminent. It’s too late to do anything now. Why don’t we just let nature take its course?”

Yan Sihai’s brows furrowed.

The military advisor continued, “If Qin Yu really appears at the wedding, no matter what... We can’t let him leave Jingdu!”

“Of course, if Young Master Han is able to behead Qin Yu on the spot, that would naturally be for the best.”

Having said that, the military advisor suddenly said, “Mr. Yan, I feel that the Young Master might not be afraid of that Qin Yu.”

Young Master naturally referred to Yan Sihai’s son, Yan Jinyao.

He was also currently number one on Pyro’s younger generation’s ranking board!

However, Yan Sihai shook his head and said, “This son of mine has always been aloof from worldly affairs, and isn’t willing to participate in such battles.”

The military counselor couldn’t help but smile bitterly. Last time, even when Zhang Yin was slapped by Qin Yu, Yan Jinyao didn’t show any reaction, let alone this time.

Yan Sihai waved his hand and said, “Go and tell Han Meng to make the most of his son’s time. No matter what, he must let Qin Yu die on the 9th of September!”

“Yes, President Yan.” The military counselor nodded slightly.

Apart from that, the Han and Yan families also began to make arrangements in secret to prevent any accidents from happening.

...

Ever since Qin Yu defeated He Teng with the strength of an Inner Strength Grandmaster, Qin Yu’s name had spread.

All the aristocratic families and sects, big and small, knew that a genius had emerged from Chuzhou and defeated a half-step Martial Marquis with the strength of an Inner Strength Grandmaster.

Even the Martial Arts Forum was speculating Qin Yu’s strength after stepping into the half-step Martial Marquis Realm!

In the end, everyone gave a unanimous evaluation:

Once Qin Yu stepped into the half-step Martial Marquis realm, no one would be able to stop him!

At this moment, Qin Yu was sitting in the living room.

In front of him lay a woman with an extremely perfect figure.

“Master, what happened to Miss Fang?” Yao Qing asked from the side.

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “I’m not sure either.”

Taozi walked forward. She tried to check Fang Yue’s body, but in the end, she also shook her head.

“Taozi, I’ll leave Fang Yue to you to take care of,” Qin Yu said to Taozi.

Taozi nodded and said, “Elder Qin, I understand.”

“Mr. Qin, where are you going?” Yao Qing muttered.

Qin Yu spat out, “Cultivation.”

There was only one month left until the ninth day of the ninth lunar month. Qin Yu had to step into the half-step Martial Marquis realm before that.

Moreover... There was still the Hong Yi Sect to worry about. The ten half-step Martial Marquis that they had sent out could appear at any time.

If Qin Yu continued to stay in Chuzhou, he would definitely attract trouble.

“I might have to leave for a period of time. I don’t know when I’ll be back.” Qin Yu looked at Taozi and Yao Qing.

“If there’s anything, you can go find Jiang Gu. If it’s really not possible, you can go back to the Divine Alchemist Pavilion.”

Seeing Qin Yu’s serious expression, the two of them didn’t dare to ask further. They just nodded non-stop.

In the following time, Qin Yu had to think of all ways to break through to the half-step Martial Marquis Realm!

At the moment, Qin Yu’s realm was already sufficient. If he had enough spiritual energy or dark energy, then breaking through to the half-step Martial Marquis realm wouldn’t be a problem at all.

After thinking about it, Qin Yu decided to go to Dongchuan for the time being.

The strategic significance of the Water Rhyme Tower was great, and... there was definitely a secret in the Water Rhyme Tower!

It was impossible for a single tower to have the same effect as the Enlightenment Tea.

Last time, time was tight, so Qin Yu was unable to discover the secret in the Water Rhyme Tower. This time, he had to find out what the Water Rhyme Tower was hiding no matter what.

...

Hongzhou, Cangzao City.

This place was very close to Jingdu, but the topography was very different.

And in a remote plain in Cangzao City, there was an extremely large sect.

Although it was called a sect, in fact, it was similar to a company.

Not only did it have high-rise buildings, but it also had a large area of land.

This place was the largest sect in the north, the Saint Confucian Sect.

And behind them was the residence of the Yan family.

In the sect, a young man was kneeling on the ground.

In front of him, on a huge yellow rosewood chair, an old man in a Chinese tunic suit was sipping tea.

“He Teng, number one in the Central Plains,” the old man said aloofly.

“I remember that the Saint Confucian Sect once sent you an invitation, but it was rejected. What, now that you’ve lost to Qin Yu, you want to join the Saint Confucian Sect?”

He Teng stood up and shook his head. “Elder Qu, you’ve misunderstood. I’m here to help the Saint Confucian Sect.”

A hint of displeasure flashed across Elder Qu’s face.

“Help the Saint Confucian Sect? He Teng, aren’t you overestimating yourself a little too much?” Elder Qu said coldly.

He Teng wasn’t anxious. He smiled aloofly and said, “I have a treasure that can help people raise their cultivation level in a short period of time.”

“Qin Yu and I relied on this treasure to reach this realm in such a short period of time.”

“Elder Qu, you should know better than me what this treasure means to the Saint Confucian Sect.”
