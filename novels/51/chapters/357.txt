Chapter 358: Old Mister Yan’s Birthday Banquet Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Qin Yu followed behind Old Mister Yan and walked out of the villa.

Then, they got into a car and slowly drove towards a relatively remote house not far away.

The car drove for nearly half an hour before finally arriving in front of this house.

The house was not big, but it was heavily guarded.

At the door, there were three Inner Strength Grandmasters waiting there.

“Old Mister Yan.” The two Inner Strength Grandmasters quickly cupped their hands and bowed when they saw Old Mister Yan.

Old Mister Yan waved his hand and brought Qin Yu to the door.

The door was supported by a special material, and the lock was facial recognition.

Old Mister Yan walked forward and the door slowly opened.

Then, a strong medicinal aroma immediately assaulted him!

Qin Yu took a deep breath and immediately felt refreshed!

As far as the eye could see, there were medicine bottles one after another in this house!

“What... What are these?” Seeing the entire warehouse of herbs, Qin Yu could not help but widen his eyes!

Old Mister Yan said indifferently, “These are all my collections over the years.”

“Collections?” Qin Yu gulped.

There were at least over a hundred herbs in this room, and each of them was at least five hundred years old!

Compared to Old Mister Yan, who had such an abundant herbal warehouse, Dong Tianhai was not worthy of being called the King of Medicine!

“Do you like it?” Old Mister Yan said indifferently with his hands behind his back.

Qin Yu couldn’t help but say, “I like it. Who wouldn’t like it?”

Old Mister Yan glanced at Qin Yu and said, “Then I’ll tell you a piece of news that will make you despair. The Han family’s stock is at least as abundant as mine, or perhaps even greater.”

“In other words, Han Wei doesn’t need to worry about herbs at all.”

Qin Yu had already expected that these aristocratic families didn’t lack resources, but he never thought that the gap would be so huge!

Even 500-year-old herbs were not worth mentioning, and 1,000-year-old herbs could be eaten like carrots!

How could an ordinary person make up for the difference?

“If one day, you really beat Han Wei, these herbs will all be yours,” Old Mister Yan said indifferently.

Qin Yu couldn’t help but gasp.

He said jokingly, “Really?”

“Of course,” Old Mister Yan said.

“But I can’t give them to you now. These are all treasures. If Han Wei kills you, wouldn’t it be a waste?” Old Mister Yan muttered.

Qin Yu was speechless.

Seeing Qin Yu’s expression, Old Mister Yan casually took one and handed it to Qin Yu.

“I’ll give you one. Take it.” Old Mister Yan waved his hand and said.

Qin Yu coughed and took the herbs. He cupped his hands and said, “Thank you, Old Mister Yan. Then I won’t stand on ceremony.”

The two of them walked out of the warehouse, then the door of the warehouse slowly closed.

In the next few days, Old Mister Yan did not play chess with Qin Yu. Instead, he went out all day and seemed quite busy.

That continued until this morning.

Old Mister Yan had dressed up and looked quite radiant. No one could tell that he was dying.

“Grandpa, why do you look so radiant today?” Yan Ruoxue could not help but be surprised when she saw this.

Old Mister Yan said with a faint smile, “Drop everything on your schedule today and follow me to the West Bank Manor.”

The West Bank Manor was another one of Old Mister Yan’s properties.

It was built on a big mountain and was usually empty.

“West Bank Manor? Grandpa, are we going to move to another place?” Yan Ruoxue asked. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Old Mister Yan waved his hand and said mysteriously, “I want to celebrate my birthday in advance. Let’s go. Everything has been arranged over there.”

The news of Old Mister Yan celebrating his birthday had already been spread, but Yan Ruoxue didn’t know about it at all.

“Qin Yu, you should come with me.” Old Mister Yan glanced at Qin Yu and said.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “Okay.”

The three of them got in the car and rushed to the West Bank Manor.

Everything had already been set up, and the entrance of the huge manor was already filled with luxury cars.

Before the host even arrived, there was already an endless stream of people who had come to celebrate his birthday.

Han Meng and Han Wei had come early to wait for him.

During this time, countless people had come to make connections, but they were all ignored by Han Meng.

They only had one target, and that was Old Mister Yan.

On the way, Yan Ruoxue leaned against Old Mister Yan’s side and said with a smile, “Grandpa, you look especially radiant today. You look at least ten years younger!”

Old Mister Yan also laughed and said, “Then I will wear this every day from now on!”

Despite seeing the warm scene between the two of them, Qin Yu couldn’t smile.

Because he could see that although Old Mister Yan was trying hard to look energetic, he still couldn’t hide the fact that his body was weak.

Soon, the car arrived at the West Bank Manor.

As soon as the car stopped, countless people swarmed around while waiting for Old Mister Yan to get out of the car.

“What are you waiting for? Hurry up and open the door for Old Mister Yan.” In the dark, Han Meng looked at Han Wei coldly.

Han Wei quickly nodded and ran to the front of the car.

He used his inner strength to push aside the crowd in front of the car and then opened the door for Old Mister Yan personally.

However, after the door was opened, the first person who came into sight was not Old Mister Yan, but Qin Yu.
