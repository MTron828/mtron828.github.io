1885 The Yao Family in Zhongzhou

Qin Yu was shocked. At the same time, he was more convinced of his own thoughts.

“Will the day of the Path of Heaven be chosen by the heavens?” Qin Yu’s expression was a little ugly.

He thought of his father. His role as the Guardian was also a chosen existence.

The difference was that the Guardians were chosen the moment they were born. However, who were the ones choosing them? Which specific person would choose them?

!!

Qin Yu couldn’t figure it out. He recalled the existence that descended from the sky during his tribulation.

Could it be that the Path of Heaven was also a specific person?

“That’s right.” Dean Lei, by the side, nodded slightly.

“However, there must be a balance in everything. Some people are chosen on the day of the Path of Heaven, and some are abandoned.”

Dean Lei’s expression turned grave at this point.

Qin Yu’s brows tightly furrowed. He looked at Dean Lei doubtfully and said in a deep voice, “Abandoned? What do you mean by that?”

“It means those abandoned will never have the chance to step into the Tribulation Transcending Stage, never and ever,” Dean Lei said.

Qin Yu opened his mouth and suddenly felt speechless.

Wasn’t this d*mned unfair?

“Therefore, the one chosen on the day of the Path of Heaven will definitely be favored by everyone. However, the one abandoned will be spurned,” Dean Lei continued.

Qin Yu’s expression turned uglier.

When he was still on Earth, Qin Yu had already deeply felt the injustice of the world. Now it was the same in Holy Region.

No one knew what rules it was based on to be chosen.

Was it a personal wish? Or was it some kind of innate unique physique? No one knew.

“Why are you asking all these?” Dean Lei asked.

“Nothing,” Qin Yu said with a smile. “I just happened to hear this news, so I’m just asking.”

“Who knows? You may be the one chosen on the day of the Path of Heaven,” Dean Lei nodded and said.

“I don’t have such a hope,” Qin Yu shook his head and said.

Dean Lei laughed heartily. He waved his hand and said, “Everything is possible,”

Qin Yu didn’t say anything else. He had never wanted to rely on luck to decide the direction of his future because the feeling of being chosen made him feel very uncomfortable.

Qin Yu didn’t stay any longer. After chatting with Dean Lei for a while, he left the first main peak.

After the competition, Qin Yu knew that he could no longer hide the fact of his chaotic body.

Due to Si Shiyue’s existence, the chaotic body had attracted a lot of attention. Therefore, the news of Qin Yu’s special physique would spread soon. It seemed impossible to keep a low profile.

Since this was the case, Qin Yu felt it didn’t matter anymore. He would have to face Si Shiyue sooner or later anyway. Therefore, there wasn’t much difference if it was one day earlier or later.

If Si Shiyue wanted to get rid of Qin Yu, he could just hide in Thunder Courtyard.

No matter how powerful the Si family was, they would never barge into Thunder Courtyard directly.

Just as Qin Yu was on his way to Demon-slaying Peak, two elderly men suddenly blocked his way.

The strength of these two people was incredibly powerful. Even Qin Yu could not see through it.

He looked at the two elderly men, cupped his hands, and said, “Seniors, why are you blocking my way?”

“We’ve been waiting for Young friend Qin here,” the two said with a faint smile.

Qin Yu remained silent, waiting for them to continue.

“You’ve shown great brilliance in Thunder Courtyard’s competition and even defeated Si Shiyu,” one of them said faintly. “Such talent is truly shocking.”

Hearing this, Qin Yu slightly heaved a sigh of relief. Fortunately, they were not here to cause trouble.

“Senior, thank you for your compliment,” Qin Yu cupped his hands and said.

“Hehe! Young friend Qin has a chaotic body and such powerful combat strength. You’ll definitely leave a strong mark in Holy Region in the future,” the man laughed and said.

“I wonder if Young friend Qin would be interested in following us back?”

“May I know where you two seniors are from?” Qin Yu frowned and asked.

The moment he said that, the two immediately said with pride, “We are from the Yao family of Zhongzhou.”

“The Yao family?” Qin Yu was stunned. Obviously, he had never heard of it.

Seeing Qin Yu at a loss, the two seemed a little displeased.

“Young friend Qin, you must have heard of the Yao family of the nine great aristocratic families, right?” one of the elderly men said in a deep voice.

Qin Yu was stunned. He quickly said, “So, Seniors are from the nine great aristocratic families. I’m really sorry. I don’t know much about Zhongzhou. Please forgive me if I have offended you.”

The two didn’t seem to mind and just waved their hands. One of them said, “With Young friend Qin’s talent and our Yao family’s background, you’ll definitely be able to shine in the future. It’s not impossible for you to even be on par with Si Shiyue.” ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

The other person nodded slightly and said, “That’s right. Even if you can’t compare to Si Shiyue, you won’t be too far off. You’ll definitely become one of the top-notch people in the Holy Region in the future.

Qin Yu couldn’t help but scoff in his heart.

Comparable to Si Shiyue? That was not Qin Yu’s goal.

“Thank you for your appreciation. But I’m really sorry. I’ve already promised Dean Lei that I’ll stay at Demon-slaying Peak for the time being,” Qin Yu replied politely.

The two men frowned and said, “Could it be that Young friend Qin is looking down on our Yao family? Countless people in Holy Region have wanted to join the Yao family, but they don’t even have the chance.”

“That’s right. As long as you join the Yao family, we’ll definitely do our best to nurture you.”

Qin Yu smiled and said, “Seniors, you’ve misunderstood. It’s not that I don’t want to join the Yao family. It’s just that I’ve just promised Dean Lei.”

...

“It’s fine. As long as you agree, the Yao family will come forward to negotiate with Dean Lei,” one of them said.

Qin Yu could not help but frown.

He didn’t expect it to be of no use even though he mentioned Dean Lei.

Qin Yu thought for a moment, smiled, and said, “Seniors, I have a bad temper and have offended many people. If I go to the Yao family, I’m afraid I’ll bring trouble to the family.”

“Hahaha! Young friend Qin must be joking. Who in the world is our Yao family afraid of?” The two of them were full of pride.

“What if they are also from one of the nine great aristocratic families?” Qin Yu rolled his eyes, smiled, and said.

As soon as he said that, the two of them frowned.

They looked at Qin Yu and asked, “Young friend Qin, who exactly have you offended? If it’s not a big matter, I think the other party will show us some respect.”

Seeing this, Qin Yu couldn’t help but laugh heartily.

Obviously, the Yao family was sincere in inviting Qin Yu. Therefore, he couldn’t reject them right away. He cupped his hands and said, “How about this, Seniors? If I go to Zhongzhou in the future, I will definitely pay a visit to the Yao family. I still have some important things to do at the moment and I really can’t go now.”

Seeing this, the two didn’t insist. They immediately nodded and said, “Alright. The Yao family’s door is always open for you.”
