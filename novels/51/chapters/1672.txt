Qin Yu’s expression also turned solemn.

His intuition told him that these things were definitely not simple!

“Swoosh!”

Just as the two of them were terrified, that thing instantly appeared in front of them!

Zhuo Jing immediately felt that something was wrong. He hurriedly held the Silver Spring and directly hacked at it.

“Clang!”

But something shocking happened. When the Silver Spring Cape struck its body, sparks flew in all directions, but it could not cut through it at all!

“How... how could this be!”Zhuo Jing’s face was filled with horror! Qin Yu, who was standing at the side, also widened his eyes!

One had to know that the Silver Spring was a virtual entity with endless power, but it was actually unable to cut through it!

“What on Earth is this thing!”Zhuo Jing exclaimed in shock.

Before they could figure out the situation, these insect-like things had already pounced on them!

Qin Yu did not dare to be negligent. He endured the pain and let out an explosive shout. His entire body’s internal Qi burst out to the extreme!

Then, his body emitted a golden light. His crushing fist suddenly struck out. Golden Light instantly lit up the entire desert!

“Boom!”

A terrifying explosion exploded. This insect was sent flying by Qin Yu’s punch, but in the next second, it crawled up again and headed straight for Qin Yu!

With such a huge number, even if Qin Yu had great abilities, he would not be able to deal with it!

This thing could easily break through Qin Yu’s physical defense and tear his body apart until it was dripping with blood!

“Be careful!”

At this moment, Zhuo Jing suddenly shouted from behind!

A bug was already heading straight for Qin Yu’s head! It was as if it wanted to pierce through Qin Yu’s head!

With such speed, Qin Yu simply could not Dodge in time!

At this critical moment, Zhuo Jing flew over and blocked behind Qin Yu!

“Pu!”

That thing directly pierced through Zhuo Jing’s chest, leaving a huge bloody hole in his chest!

“Zhuo Jing!”Qin Yu’s expression changed drastically!

Not only was this thing extremely powerful in attack, its defense was also unparalleled!

If this continued, the two of them would really die here!

“Follow me!”Qin Yu suddenly thought of an idea. He pulled Zhuo Jing up and forcefully pushed his body as he shot towards the dragon burial cave!

Qin Yu relied on his powerful physical body to forcefully charge out a path, but his body was already dripping with blood.

The two hot stalks rushed all the way into the dragon burial cave. The moment they stepped into the dragon burial cave, these bugs suddenly stopped in their tracks.

They hesitated at the entrance of the cave. In their cold eyes, there was not only killing intent, but also a hint of timidity.

“As expected, they don’t dare to enter the Dragon Burial Cave,”Qin Yu said coldly.

After a moment at the entrance, the insects slowly retreated like the tide.

Qin Yu looked at Zhuo Jing and said, “Are you okay?”

Zhuo Jing touched his chest and said with a bitter smile, “We are the same now.”

Qin Yu patted his shoulder and said, “You saved my life. Thank you very much.”

Zhuo Jing waved his hand and said, “You’d better take a look at your injuries.”

He leaned over and looked over. Sure enough, Qin Yu’s body was already covered in wounds. It was a tragic sight.

At this moment, a sense of weariness washed over him.

The wounds on his body were densely packed. Even Qin Yu couldn’t bear it anymore.

“This place should be safe for the time being,”Qin Yu said in a deep voice. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Zhuo jingen said, “Those things seem to be afraid of the Dragon Burial Cave.”

“Who isn’t?”Qin Yu smiled bitterly.

He sat up cross-legged and slowly recovered from his injuries.

“What exactly are those things? Even the Silver Spring can’t break through the defense,”Zhuo Jing frowned and said.

Qin Yu said in a deep voice, “I don’t know. In short, this east barren is very unusual.”

Zhuo jing sighed and continued, “In this case, I’m afraid that the mysterious person who blocked the road is telling the truth. I’m afraid that Xiao Sheng really wants you to die here.”

Qin Yu didn’t say anything. Deep down, he still didn’t want to believe it.

“Well, I’ll rest for a while,”said Qin Yu.

Zhuo jing nodded and said, “You should rest well. If there’s anything, I’ll tell you in time.”

With that, Qin Yu closed his eyes and began to recover from his injuries.

In the next few days, the east barren seemed to have regained its peace.

In the Dragon Burial Cave, two young men were sitting cross-legged, extremely quiet.

After a few days, Qin Yu finally opened his eyes.

He looked at Zhuo Jing and said, “I have an idea...”

“Don’t think about it. If you think about it again, we will really die here,”Zhuo Jing interrupted Qin Yu.

Qin Yu also looked a little embarrassed. He coughed and said, “We can’t walk out of the East Wilderness at the moment. Why Don’t you try my idea?”

Zhuo Jing rolled his eyes at Qin Yu and said, “What Idea?”

“You’ll know in a while,”Qin Yu said with a smile.

Zhuo Jing couldn’t help but sigh and said faintly, “I hope your idea doesn’t lead us to death...”

Qin Yu didn’t say anything.

He closed his eyes and forced out another strand of divine sense.

Compared to yesterday, this strand of divine sense was much dimmer. Forcing out the divine sense had a great side effect. Now that Qin Yu had been forced out twice, he would naturally be affected.

“Are you crazy?”Zhuo Jing could not help but berate when he saw this.

Qin Yu slightly closed his eyes and said, “This is the only way to verify my thoughts.”

With that said, he controlled the strand of divine sense and went deep into the dragon burial cave for the second time.

This time, the speed of this strand of divine sense was much faster. It had a very strong purpose.

Soon, this strand of divine sense arrived at the place where it had first arrived. This meant that it could see the location of the dragon corpse without the aid of the desolate divine eye.

As expected, the next second, the Black Shadow appeared again, and with a flash, it directly erased this strand of divine sense.

Qin Yu suddenly opened his eyes!

“How is it? Did that strand of divine sense of yours go blind again?”Zhuo Jing said half-jokingly and half-seriously.

Qin Yu said excitedly, “That’s right!”

Zhuo jing frowned and said, “Why do you look so happy?”

“Because... my idea was right.”Qin Yu took a deep breath.

“Now I know why that black figure suddenly appeared.”

Zhuo Jing looked at Qin Yu, waiting for his follow-up.

Qin Yu said coldly, “Because I used the desolate God’s eye to see the dragon corpse in advance.”

Zhuo Jing was stunned and said, “You mean... as long as I see the dragon corpse, that black figure will appear?”

“That’s right.”Qin Yu got up from the ground excitedly.

He glanced at Zhuo Jing and said, “Wait here. I’ll go in and test it out.”

“Absolutely not!”Zhuo Jing made a gesture to pull Qin Yu back.

Qin Yu waved his hand and said, “Don’t worry. I have my own countermeasures.”

If he didn’t go in and check it out, Qin Yu would never give up.

“I’ll go with you,”Zhuo Jing said helplessly.

Qin Yu shook his head with a smile and said, “Don’t go with me this time. Stay here and wait for me. If my idea is true, I’ll come out to find you.”

“If it’s false, remember to come and collect my corpse in the future.”

After saying this, Qin Yu strode into the depths of the dragon burial cave.
