Chapter 724: Ownerless Secret Realm Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

That night, the man with the mustache left the Green Moon Villa, claiming that he was going to find the materials to set up the array platform.

Qin Yu was waiting at the Green Moon Villa.

The next day, Qin Yu brought Xiao Yu to the Green Moon Villa’s Spiritual Spring.

This place was once the foundation of the Saint Confucian Sect, and now there were also several martial artists cultivating here.

“That is the Spiritual Spring.” Qin Yu pointed at it.

Xiao Yu nodded and said, “I know, but the Spiritual Spring has no effect on my cultivation.”

Qin Yu didn’t say anything. He took out the coffin from the spatial artifact and placed it in front of Xiao Yu.

“You can rely on this to cultivate.” Qin Yu pointed at the coffin.

The coffin emitted waves of gloomy dark energy.

This dark energy covered the sky and covered the earth, almost instantly causing the surroundings to become cold.

Even the martial artists cultivating near the Spiritual Spring couldn’t help but shiver.

“What a dense dark energy.” Xiao Yu couldn’t help but frown, as if she felt a trace of discomfort.

Qin Yu pointed at the coffin and said, “You can rely on this coffin to cultivate and try to see if you can withstand it.”

Xiao Yu nodded. She sat cross-legged on the side of the coffin and began to absorb the dark energy from the coffin.

In just five minutes, Xiao Yu began to cough violently, and her body trembled.

“No.” Xiao Yu shook her head.

“The dark energy is too dense. I can’t withstand it at all.”

Qin Yu couldn’t help but sigh when he saw this.

The reason why he hadn’t taken out the coffin and handed it to Xiao Yu was because he was afraid that Xiao Yu wouldn’t be able to bear the dark energy here.

Therefore, Qin Yu specially brought Xiao Yu to the vicinity of the Spiritual Spring. He planned to rely on the spiritual energy of the Spiritual Spring to neutralize the dark energy in the coffin.

But even so, Xiao Yu still couldn’t bear it.

Seeing Qin Yu’s regretful expression, Xiao Yu suddenly bit his lips and said, “I’ll try again.”

After saying that, Xiao Yu closed her eyes again and continued to absorb the dark energy in the coffin.

Not long after, Xiao Yu’s body trembled again, and her body became extremely cold. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

However, this time, Xiao Yu didn’t get up. She secretly gritted her teeth and endured it.

One minute, two minutes, five minutes, a whole half an hour, Xiao Yu seemed to gradually adapt to the dark energy in the coffin.

Her body no longer trembled, and the dark energy formed a small vortex around her body, crazily surging into her body.

Qin Yu couldn’t help but widen his eyes.

Xiao Yu’s adaptability was too terrifying.

One had to know that even Qin Yu couldn’t do it at all back then! Moreover, Qin Yu was also controlling the Meridian Circulation Technique!

Looking at Xiao Yu, who was absorbing the dark energy, Qin Yu couldn’t help but mutter in a low voice, “Under normal circumstances, a pure dark energy body wouldn’t be able to do this.”

She was only an Inner Strength Grandmaster. Such dense dark energy was enough to take Xiao Yu’s life, not to mention absorbing it.

“Looks like there’s really a connection between Xiao Yu and the masked woman,” Qin Yu said in a low voice.

Time flew by. Qin Yu didn’t leave the Spiritual Spring. He just stood there and watched quietly, afraid that something would happen to Xiao Yu.

The sky gradually darkened, and the martial artists near the Spiritual Spring all left.

Soon, only Qin Yu and Xiao Yu were left near the Spiritual Spring.

“How terrifying.”

Looking at Xiao Yu, who was absorbing the dark energy, Qin Yu sighed again.

Xiao Yu’s absorption speed was really too fast!

In just a short day, the dark energy in the coffin was actually reduced by half!

After all, Qin Yu had absorbed the coffin countless times, but he hadn’t been able to reduce it in the slightest!

“What kind of existence is this masked woman?” This made Qin Yu even more interested.

“I hope the man with the mustache can come back soon,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

If Xiao Yu was really related to the masked woman, then they would definitely discover something in the Immortal Slaying Sect.

Qin Yu sat cross-legged on Xiao Yu’s side and closed his eyes.

He opened the pores all over his body and slowly absorbed the spiritual energy from the surroundings of the Spiritual Spring.

The nearby area was filled with the smell of spiritual energy, but it was extremely thin.

At first, Qin Yu didn’t notice anything.

But soon, Qin Yu realized that something was wrong.

He opened his eyes and unconsciously sized up the Spiritual Spring.

“This sense of familiarity...” Qin Yu murmured in a low voice, and his pupils shrank!

“It feels exactly the same as when I was in Qing City!” Qin Yu said in surprise!

He hurriedly stood up from the ground and then quickly ran to the side of the Spiritual Spring.

Qin Yu picked up a handful of water from the Spiritual Spring and put it to his mouth.

“As expected!” Qin Yu’s face was full of shock!

The water of this Spiritual Spring was very similar to the food on the same street in Qing City!

“Could it be that... There is a Mystic Realm hidden near this Spiritual Spring?!” Qin Yu was shocked!

One had to know that the Saint Confucian Sect had been absorbing this Spiritual Spring for many years, and the Spiritual Spring didn’t show any signs of wear and tear!

At that time, Gu Canghai also tried to find the source, but all of his attempts ended in failure.

He tried almost every method, but couldn’t detect the strangeness of this Spiritual Spring.

“It must be so!” Qin Yu was so excited that his entire body was trembling!

The spiritual energy in this Spiritual Spring was very likely to have been emitted from a Mystic Realm nearby and then merged into this spring!

Just the overflowing spiritual energy was enough to supply the Saint Confucian Sect for so many years. Then how terrifying was the spiritual energy in this Mystic Realm?

Qin Yu didn’t dare to dwell on it. He quickly closed his eyes and began to search for that faint connection with the Mystic Realm.

Ten minutes later.

The connection became even stronger!

Qin Yu didn’t dare to dwell on it. He followed the connection and slowly walked forward.

During this time, Qin Yu kept his eyes closed and purely relied on feelings to move forward.

The connection became even stronger. After moving forward for dozens of meters, the feeling reached its peak!

Qin Yu suddenly opened his eyes and looked around.

Qin Yu was standing at the source of the Spiritual Spring. His legs were already half submerged in the water.

“This is it.” Qin Yu was extremely excited!

“There must be an ownerless Mystic Realm hidden here!”

If he could possess a Mystic Realm, then for Qin Yu, all his problems would be easily solved!

Not only could he avoid the pursuit of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association, but he could also rely on this Mystic Realm to increase his cultivation!

“This is great!” Qin Yu was momentarily unable to extricate himself from his excitement.

However, the biggest problem at hand was how to open this ownerless Mystic Realm.

Qin Yu tried to find a method from his inheritance, but unfortunately, there was no record of it.

“Looks like I can only place my hopes on the man with the mustache,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

Other than relying on the man with the mustache, Qin Yu had another method, which was to go to the Jingdu Martial Arts Association’s Scripture Pavilion.

There would definitely be a record of the method to open the ownerless Mystic Realm.

Just as Qin Yu was excited, a loud boom suddenly came from not far away!

“Huh? It’s in Xiao Yu’s direction.” Qin Yu’s brows were furrowed.

He didn’t have time to think and quickly ran in Xiao Yu’s direction.
