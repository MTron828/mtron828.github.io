Chapter 2569 Joint Sword Strike

2571

When the power of the green light flowed onto Zi Yang’s body, his brows twitched.

After breaking free from this power, he looked at it that was surrounding him and seemed a little curious.

He did not seem to notice Flower Granny suddenly appeared behind him. Instead, he was caressing this power.

At this moment, Flower Granny revealed a strained expression on her face.

A hexagonal crystal appeared in front of her, and with this crystal as the center, it emitted a green energy.

The surroundings of the crystal seemed to form another space.

Qin Yu’s body was wrapped in a layer of power, which seemed to be the protective power given by Flower Granny. Otherwise, despite Qin Yu’s Glazed Holy Body, he could be torn apart by the surrounding energy at any time.

“The power of misfortune? As long as I can kill a monster like you who takes life lightly, so what if I were to be plagued by misfortune?”

Time Reversal!

Flower Granny said coldly, and the crystal suddenly started to spin.

A dreamy light and vortex were released from the mirror of water.

As the power of the crystal was released, countless distorted vortexes appeared in the surroundings. Winding runes slowly appeared in each vortex, and the runes danced and interweaved in the space covered by the crystal.

An invisible force seemed to be rotating and spreading in space. This shape seemed to symbolize the flow and rotation of time. These powers of time flowed and surged like streams of water.

It shuttled back and forth before the vortexes at different times, circulating endlessly.

The past, the present, and the future.

Countless images of the fates of all the living beings in this space appeared continuously.

Flower Granny stared intensely at Zi Yang, her pupils reflecting Zi Yang’s figure at where he was.

The explosive light of the fire lotus slowly retracted back into its true body, and the extreme burning anger slowly subsided.

Zi Yang’s body began to change under this power.

He transformed into the slightly naive disciple under his master, the two kneeling before their ancestor, pledging their earnest vows in the shelter of their master, thinking everything between heaven and earth was so simple, just like cultivation.

“Are you willing to step into the Dao, sever worldly emotions, and become an immortal in heaven?”

Master asked with a smile. At that time, they only aspired to attain the qualities of immortals and never realized how heavy the consequence of severing worldly emotions was.

“Grandpa, what is Dao?

The Great Dao was formless, giving birth to heaven and earth.

The Great Dao was impartial, governing the movements of the sun and moon.

The Great Dao was nameless, giving birth to all things.

I did not know its name, but I insisted on calling it Dao.

This was Dao…

The youth looked at the grandfather, who was like an immortal in the sky and revealed a look of longing.

“I’m not willing.”

Zi Yang said softly, interrupting the scene.

He walked out of the world of that time and looked at the ignorant youth who spoke again.

“I’m not willing.”

An ordinary Daoist sword appeared in his hand, and he stabbed at the youth.

This sword strike completely shattered his past.

“The origin of Dao persists within the world of time. Even the power of time can’t hinder its operation.” Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Zi Yang said coldly.

“Pfft!”

Flower Granny’s eyeballs seemed unable to withstand the terrifying power and suddenly exploded.

“Flower Granny!”

Qin Yu shouted.

As Flower Granny fell onto the ground, the crystal in front of her exploded.

The power of time began to collapse, turning into chaotic time currents that howled through the vast expanse of heaven and earth.

Yan Ruoxue’s body suddenly appeared behind Zi Yang.

“No, Ruoxue!”

Qin Yu’s eyes were on the verge of bursting. At this moment, Yan Ruoxue had unleashed the last cycle of the Destiny Reincarnation. If she died again, her body and soul would be extinguished.

Qin Yu gathered all the power of Primordial Chaos.

After his body absorbed holy energy for a period, his body could now temporarily withstand this destructive power.

Taking the opportunity of the moment Flower Granny and Yan Ruoxue had fought for, Qin Yu’s body appeared in front of Zi Yang. This was the first time he was so close to Zi Yang.

At this moment, he gathered the Saint’s world’s holy energy in his right hand and slowly unleashed Xuan Xin’s Green Duckweed Sword at Zi Yang.

The Tai Chi sword intent appeared in heaven and earth again.

The Tai Chi’s Way of the Sword seemed to have a completely different offensive power under the influence of holy energy.

This was the last slash of Xuan Xin’s remaining will.

Two opposing Yin and Yang internal qi emanated from the Green Duckweed Sword, and an enormous Tai Chi Diagram appeared out of thin air.

However, this time, the sword of Tai Chi that had comprehended the will of Zi Yang instantly reached its peak.

Borrowing the power of Qin Yu’s hand, the power of this sword broke through the limit effortlessly, reaching the strength of the sixth level for an instant.

At this moment, countless people felt the power of the Tribulation Sixth Level.

“How is this possible? Who can surpass the shackles of this world and reach this level of power?”

Su Xinghe looked at the Mysterious Heavenly Sword Sect in a puzzle. At this moment, due to the great battle, he could no longer pry into the scene in this space.

“Guess who is it? The masked woman? Or Xuan Xin? Or was it someone from the Human Race Watch? There seems to be no one else on that battlefield.”

Immortal Crane also looked surprised.

Xiao Sheng looked indifferent as he stared at where the strong sword intent was coming from. He seemed to be thinking of something.

The demon race, the ghost race, the monster race, and the human race all had their eyes on this expanse of heaven and earth.

In everyone’s eyes, the extermination of the Mysterious Heavenly Sword Sect had been inevitable.

Saint Zi Yang’s internal qi was much stronger than Chen Shuang’s, and the other Saints could not support him.

However, the Saint-level power that they sensed at that moment caused many speculations by many people.

“Could it be that someone has broken through to the Saint-level again? That’s impossible!”

Shen Xiao was also puzzled.

A sixth-level Saint would not leak this kind of power.

The power of a Saint could be controlled infinitely within the limits of the Path of Heaven. There would not be a situation of crossing realms. This was not because of the limitations of the dao power.

It differed from before the Golden Path of Heaven, when he could not surpass the power of a fifth-level True Saint.

This was due to the limitation of the body, which could not withstand the power of the Saint-level, even if it was Qin Yu’s Glazed Holy Body.

After being transformed by holy energy, it could only store a wisp of it. This kind of power could not even be compared to the power of the Primordial Chaos.

When delivering this sword strike, Qin Yu’s body began to shatter.

If it weren’t for the Glazed Holy Body and the Seal of Heaven Returning, this wisp of holy energy would have destroyed his body completely.
