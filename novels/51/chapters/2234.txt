2235 Hunting the Demon Fox

Having just left the city, Qin Yu and the others were outside Solitary Cloud City.

“Junior Sister Ruoyun, why didn’t you find our Azure Firmament Sect’s people to team up?”

The three walked toward Qin Yu. The leader of the group was a young man with a gloomy expression. He had a deep scar on his cheekbone.

“None of your business.”

Piao Ruoyun snorted coldly.

“Haha, Little Junior Sister, you’re still holding a grudge from the previous incident? Well, how about this? You’ll get a 30% share teaming up this time, and the three of us will take the remaining 70%.”

The young man said with a smile.

“That’s right, Little Junior Sister. Previously, when the demonic beasts were rioting, we had no choice but to retreat first. We’re all from the same sect, so there’s no point in holding grudges.”

A plump, enchanting woman covered her mouth and giggled.

“That’s right. This guy is only in third grade. How much can he do? He might even drag you down when the time comes!”

Another man echoed.

“Third-grade True Saint trash, you can get lost now.”

The man with a gloomy expression put a hand on Qin Yu’s shoulder and said to him with a smile.

“You don’t understand what I said, do you? Get lost!”

The dagger at Piao Ruoyun’s waist was like a poisonous snake pressing against the gloomy man’s neck.

“Okay, okay, okay. Forget it since Little Junior Sister doesn’t appreciate it.”

The gloomy man raised his hand and patted Qin Yu’s shoulder before he left.

A trace of internal qi was lurking on Qin Yu’s shoulder. Qin Yu frowned and ignored it for the time being.

“Let’s go!”

Piao Ruoyun took out a small cauldron and jumped onto it.

The small bronze cauldron was engraved with a formation to conceal internal qi. No demonic beasts approached them along the way.

“Are those people from your sect?”

Qin Yu asked curiously. It seemed that there was not much harmony in the Azure Firmament Sect.

“Yes, those few people entered the Azure Firmament Sect before me. There are only limited resources in the sect, so it’s common for everyone to fight among themselves. Last time, I almost fell into their trap, so I’d rather form a team with people I don’t know than with those in the sect.” VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Piao Ruoyun said angrily.

“How powerful is your sect in this galaxy?”

Qin Yu asked curiously.

“There are the evil exterminator, the Blood Sect, the Azure Firmament Sect, the Mysterious Dark Sect, and other small sects. It’s too difficult to get resources if you’re alone. There’s also a lot of competition within the sect, and you’ll get killed any time. It’s rare for a weak rogue cultivator like you to have no sect.”

Piao RuoYun said with a frown.

“What about your sect master’s strength?”

Qin Yu asked curiously. He wanted to compare the combat strength of the four great sects of this galaxy with the nine great aristocratic families of the Holy Region.

“Why did you ask?”

Piao Ruoyun said warily.

“I’m just curious. Look at my third-grade True Saint strength. I don’t have the strength to do that even if I have the thought.”

Qin Yu smiled embarrassedly.

“That’s true. However, your physical cultivation is indeed tremendously strong. To be able to resist the formation I set up using your physical body, your physical body should be stronger than some from the demon ace.”

Piao Ruoyun nodded and continued.

“The sect master of our Azure Firmament Sect mainly cultivates the Way of Soul. Our sect master Xiao Yuexiu’s cultivation has long been beyond the seventh-grade True Saint. His soul cultivation is even more unfathomable. Within a thought, it can determine one’s life and death!”

“So strong?”

Qin Yu was shocked.

“It’s not just our sect master. The sect masters of the four great sects have existed for nearly several thousand years. The oldest sect master of the Blood Sect has lived for nearly ten thousand years. His strength is probably only on the surface, and the true strength will probably only reveal during the battle.”

Piao Ruoyun said.

“It seems that there are also many old monsters hidden in the Holy Region, but they just usually don’t show up. The oldest of the nine great aristocratic families has only cultivated for a thousand years, including Yan Guyun and the others, who are not old. Otherwise, with the resources of the Holy Region, their strength on the surface is simply too weak. It’s impossible.”

Qin Yu thought to himself.

Just like on Earth previously, many rogue cultivators in the Mighty Realm had been lying low and only came out of seclusion when the second-level Rystic realm opened.

At this moment, a nearly transparent spiritual ship appeared ten thousand meters away from Qin Yu and the others.

The gloomy man on the ship sneered and said, “Little Junior Sister should be going to hunt the six-tailed fox. Since she doesn’t want us to disturb her, we’ll wait for them to make their move first.”

“Senior brother, can they kill the six-tailed fox just the two of them?”

The woman asked in confusion.

“The six-tailed fox has too many bewitching techniques. Even if we attack together, we might not be able to take it down.”

Another person shook his head.

Previously, the three of them and Piao Ruoyun had used all their methods, but the demonic fox had still managed to escape effortlessly.

“Little Junior Sister still has some tricks up her sleeve. When the time comes, she will deplete the six-tailed fox’s soul power, and it’ll be much easier for us to kill it. This time, I spent a lot of effort and borrowed the sect’s Soul-hunting Bell. We must kill this demon fox.”

A quaint and solemn bell appeared in the palm of the gloomy man’s hand. There were eight ferocious ghosts carved on it.

The moment the Soul-hunting Bell appeared, all the demonic beasts within a radius of a thousand meters suddenly froze as if their souls had been sucked away.

The gloomy man and the others resumed their actions only after they were a few thousand meters away.

…

At the sixth level of purgatory, Qin Yu suddenly felt his body become heavy. That feeling was the feeling of oppression in her divine soul.

“No! It’s absorbing the power of my soul!”

Qin Yu frowned. What kind of method was this?

“Our luck is pretty good. A six-tailed fox actually appeared nearby.”

Piao Ruoyun said excitedly.

She grabbed the dagger in her hand, and a light green soul power attached to the blade. Then she suddenly waved her hand and cut off the connection between the soul of the six-tailed fox and Qin Yu.

“Bewilderment!”

Piao Ruoyun sat on the spot, and the power of her soul surged out like a tide.

Her soul power suddenly rippled out. A six-tailed fox seemed drunk and spun in circles on the spot.

Qin Yu moved his body and instantly attacked. The six-tailed fox was killed by him without any resistance.

A green inner core appeared in his hand. The six-tailed fox’s inner core had a dense soul internal qi.

“Good! Good cooperation!”

Piao Ruoyun reached out her hand and gave Qin Yu a palm strike.

After searching the surroundings of the sixth level, they did not find any other six-tailed foxes.

“We can only go to the seventh level now. We must kill them in one strike. Otherwise, we would rather not attack. There are too many powerful demonic beasts here. I’m afraid I can’t protect you when the time comes.”

Piao Ruoyun said solemnly.

Qin Yu nodded. Piao Ruoyun’s strength could be considered decent. She could completely suppress the six-tailed fox. He should be able to gather some Bone Cultivation Water at that time.

In the space at the seventh level, the scene was still the same as what Qin Yu saw previously.

“I’ve unleashed the Technique of Seeking Reprieve. Unless it’s a demonic beast with higher soul cultivation than mine, it won’t be able to discover us. You only attack when I tell you to do so.”
