2344 Nine Paths Convergence

“Teng Zixu.”

The chosen one of the Holy Region. Although he was smiling right now, and no one could sense any killing intent on him…

Qin Yu’s soul felt a bone-chilling cold as if facing an extremely dangerous wild beast.

Teng Zixu stepped forward and saw Qin Yu and Jue Wu’s vigilant expressions.

He waved his hand. “Brother Qin, I’m not interested in your strength right now. My target is this woman.”

He suddenly pointed at Jue Wu. “I sensed an internal qi that defied the Path of Heaven from her.”

Qin Yu’s expression changed. Defying the Path of Heaven? Did he refer to the contract between Jue Wu and the masked woman?

His thoughts were as quick as lightning as he recalled that the evil exterminator seemed to hold the same attitude of complete and ruthless elimination toward Jue Wu.

Could it be that all the chosen ones could sense the thoughts of the Path of Heaven?

And they would conform to the Path of Heaven to further increase their strengths?

Before Qin Yu could react, he heard Teng Zi Xu say softly.

“Is this the choice of the masked woman of nine lifetimes? A Nirvana Body that has removed the curse?”

In an instant, Teng Zixu’s internal qi locked onto Jue Wu.

Tens of thousands of murderous intents instantly enveloped her, and heaven and earth seemed to have become a cage that imprisoned her. She could not move at all.

Teng Zixu looked up at the sky. The clear skies had turned into rolling dark clouds in the blink of an eye.

Amidst the massive dark clouds rubbing against each other, countless giant lightning bolts rolled and surged.

A terrifying power of heavenly might suddenly trembled, and the destructive fluctuation of the Path of Heaven enveloped the sky. It was the true power of half-step heavenly might.

Teng Zixu had already stepped into a new cultivation realm. It was much more terrifying than the trace of heavenly might that Qin Yu’s spirit bead contained!

“Soul Shattering Golden Radiance!”

Qin Yu no longer hesitated, and the divine sense golden figurine broke out of his body directly. He knew he could only fight with all his might at this moment.

A giant sword slashed down fiercely and passed through Qin Yu’s golden divine sense figurine directly, suppressing it on the ground.

At this moment, the weak Qin Yu was no match for Teng Zixu at all.

“Brother Qin, you should just stay here for now. I guarantee that I won’t attack you. I will only kill those who disrespect the Path of Heaven.”

Teng Zixu did not even look at Qin Yu as he opened his mouth and spat out two words.

“Thunder Dragon.”

In the sky, countless lightning bolts instantly gathered, forming a colossal thunder dragon resembling a waterfall.

The thunder dragon was like a true dragon, letting out a dragon’s roar that shook the heavens and earth. It then spiraled toward Jue Wu.

The entire sky and earth instantly transformed into a world of thunder and lightning, with the sky filled with enormous electrical arcs.

All living beings within a radius of 10,000 miles instantly turned into charcoal.

This attack was a genuine demigod attack.

The Coffin of Nine Lifetimes!

With a thought, Qin Yu sent out a finely crafted coffin from the Sumeru ring.

The black Qin Yu’s divine sense blasted into the coffin and circulated a round according to the spiritual energy route the man of mustache had told him.

In the coffin, a destructive ghostly aura soared into the sky. Under Qin Yu’s control, this ghostly qi directly blasted into Jue Wu’s body.

In an instant, Jue Wu’s pupils turned pitch-black, and a terrifying ghostly qi erupted from her body.

In an instant, the internal qi of the entire space became gloomy.

Countless ghostly figures snickered as they shuttled through space.

Jue Wu raised her hand and slapped. That thunder dragon shattered piece by piece just like that.

After that, that internal qi did not stop and crashed toward Teng Zixu.

Teng Zixu roared and pointed a finger at the ghostly qi.

The moment his body came into contact, he was sent flying backward.

This trace of remaining breath caused him to break through space and enter the boundless void.

He had to smash through countless spatial barriers before he could dispel that terrifying force.

“A perfect Nine Paths Convergence. Even though the Path of Heaven is targeting you, you’ve comprehended the perfect power of rules… What do you want to do exactly? The masked woman?” Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

A massive bloody hole appeared on Teng Zixu’s chest. He patted his clothes as if he did not care about the wound on his body at all.

“However, the person you chose to contract with is too weak. The next time, that coffin will no longer be sufficient to protect her.”

The moment Qin Yu repelled Teng Zixu, the Sumeru qi enveloped everyone, and they disappeared into the void.

Everyone shuttled through the void non-stop, and he did not care that this would consume a vast amount of Sumeru qi.

If Teng Zixu caught up to them again, they would never have the chance to escape.

Jue Wu also fainted at this moment. Just now, he had used the masked woman’s coffin internal qi to let Jue Wu, who was bound to the masked woman, attack. This kind of power had already exceeded the limits of what her body could bear.

…

At the central square of Solitary Cloud City…

“D*mn it, they actually escaped.”

Yao Xi cursed.

“It’s fine. Teng Zi Xu has caught up. These two people should be dead for sure.” Si Qianjing looked distracted.

“Teng Zixu is not under our control at all. How would we know if he would take Qin Yu’s supreme treasures all for himself?”

Yao Xi was displeased.

“No matter how unruly he is, he’s just a rootless soil without foundation. Once the Golden Path of Heaven descends, the Supreme Elders can take action. If Teng Zixu doesn’t know what’s good for him, he can be destroyed with a flip of the hand. Let’s ignore him for now.”

Si Qianjing shook his head. A chosen one was not qualified to impact the aristocratic families.

“The most important thing now is to take over all the Mystic Realms of the Ji family. From the interrogation of the people around Ji Yue, the Ji family has been operating for many years. There are many hidden treasures in the family, including all kinds of supreme treasures, life spiritual essence, heavenly soul stone, countless spiritual energy Mystic Realms, and even many tribulation magical artifacts.”

These things, the accumulation of two Path of Heaven years, even Yao Xi would drool over this wealth.

“That’s not right. I’ve checked the information. This Ji family is just an ordinary family. They can’t possibly accumulate so much wealth even after operating for so long.”

Si Qianjing was deep in thought as if he was carefully weighing whether the news was accurate.

“It must have been some fortuitous encounters. According to the elder who refined the soul, only Ji Yue knows the true supreme treasures. These caretakers only know about 10% to 20% of it. We must capture Ji Yue and interrogate her when Teng Zixu returns.”

Yao Xi’s expression was gloomy. The higher one cultivated, the more terrifying the resources needed.

With sufficient resources, even a pig could forcefully be raised to a saint pig.

Qin Yu and the group had already arrived at the Azure Ridge Continent. He released Ji Yue and the others from the Sumeru ring.

“I’m going to the ninth level of purgatory. You guys find a place to hide first. Don’t let them find you.”

“Qin Yu.”

Ji Yue suddenly said inexplicably.

“What’s the matter?”

“Can I trust you?”

Ji Yue suddenly smiled and took out an inconspicuous soul stone.

“This is the memory soul stone of my Ji family. I need my soul to open it. My Ji family was once a famous family in the Holy Region, and we have countless experts. During the last ancient war, almost all the experts of the Ji family came to purgatory to fight the alien races. However, we didn’t expect the Holy Region to betray us and kill all the talented cultivators.”
