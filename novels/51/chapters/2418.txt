Chapter 2419 Bargains

A colossal Great Vajradhara gradually took shape and appeared behind Wu Chang’s head.

The Great Vajradhara was the body of Buddha’s anger. The evil spirits were destroyed when it appeared.

His fiery red hair was burning with flames of karma, and his eyes glared furiously.

In an instant, the peaceful Buddhist power boiled like boiling water and became tremendously violent.

Wu Chang opened his eyes and struck out with his palm.

“Boom!”

The two palms collided instantly, and the enormous shockwave even caused space to collapse.

Amidst the endless smoke and dust, the flames of karma blazed fiercely. A massive handprint appeared on the chest of the Immortal Emperor’s corpse.

The burned handprint emitted a stinky energy of dead bodies. Wu Chang put his palms together and walked forward step by step.

The Great Vajradhara behind him released endless flames of karma. A path of survival opened up in front of him and spread to the Immortal Emperor’s corpse.

“This d*mn bald donkey has such terrifying strength, and his strength is already at the Tribulation Fourth Level. This Immortal Emperor’s corpse might is not a match for him!”

Qin Yu frowned when he saw Wu Chang unleashing his power.

This Immortal Emperor’s corpse should have sealed a trace of his soul in the corpse, and it could only move by instinct and not unleash his original strength at all.

Otherwise, he would not be suppressed so badly by the Great Vajradhara as long as it could unleash a trace of the Immortal Emperor’s might.

“The best plan is to escape!”

The black Qin Yu’s body suddenly moved and flew away.

“Please don’t force me to kill you.” ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

He did not expect that just as he moved, a palm to land from the sky directly and almost hit Qin Yu.

“You f*cking want to kill me directly!”

The boundless flames of karma burned fiercely in front of him, and even the gravel on the ground slowly turned into glass. The terrifying high temperature made the black Qin Yu’s face turn ashen.

“Boom!”

Ji Tianming suddenly moved and slammed his palm down on Qin Yu’s head.

The black Qin Yu moved her finger, and the Sumeru Realm descended. The power of the world clashed with this palm.

Qin Yu spat out blood again and retreated. No matter what, Ji Tianming was at the Tribulation Third Level. In terms of strength, he still suppressed Qin Yu.

However, Ji Tianming stopped on the spot nervously and dared not attack again.

Wu Chang did not say anything, which made him feel relieved.

“Qin Yu, you vicious beast, go to hell!”

He grinned maliciously and attacked again.

“F*ck you. You guys forced me to do this.”

Qin Yu gritted his teeth. The power of his soul surged like a tide and ruthlessly bombarded the corpse of the Immortal Emperor.

With a thud, Qin Yu felt like arriving in a completely dark place. He seemed to feel a slight fluctuation in this endless darkness.

This was the land of consciousness of the Yao family’s Immortal Emperor. There was no sign of vitality here at this moment, but Qin Yu could still feel the slight fluctuation of divine sense.

Even so, Qin Yu could still feel the power that could destroy heaven and earth. It seemed that a slight movement could crush his divine soul power.

Qin Yu gritted his teeth and circulated the Soul Torment Mind Technique to the fastest speed.

He gently extended his hands forward, leading the tremendously weak soul power here.

The Soul Torment Mind Technique was a divine technique cultivating the soul. Previously, it had even healed Little Fatty and Elder Guai’s damaged souls to the greatest extent.

All of this happened in an instant. The Immortal Emperor’s corpse was surrounded by endless flames of karma.

The energy of dead bodies on his body suddenly disappeared, and he turned into a lifeless corpse in an instant.

Wu Chang’s expression changed drastically, and all the prayer beads of his bracelet exploded.

The flames of karma soared into the sky as if burning the sky and boiling the sea, rising steadily at a terrifying speed.

“Boom!”

A foot landed and the flames of karma were instantly extinguished.

The terrifying qi energy rushed toward Wu Chang’s body like roaring sea waves.

It shattered the Great Vajradhara at his back. He did not even have time to react before his body turned into minced meat and scattered all over.

Ji Tianming was instantly dumbfounded by this turn of events. His body stiffened, and he dared not move.

He felt that if he were to startle the corpse even slightly, he would end up like Wu Chang.

At this moment, Qin Yu’s body dared not move at all, and that trace of consciousness was already watching him.

It was like an ordinary person facing a god. Even if that trace of the Immortal Emperor’s might was not targeting him, he felt an enormous shackle binding him.

Qin Yu gritted his teeth and stopped circulating the Soul Torment Mind Technique.

He sent a strand of consciousness directly into the soul. He was betting the Immortal Emperor’s corpse dared not kill him.

“Help me do three things, and I will do my best to recover your remaining soul. However, I can only recover it after you finish doing three things. Otherwise, you can kill me at any time!”

After some time, Qin Yu finally realized that the strength of his body had suddenly lightened.

Only then did he return to his body. In an instant, he felt his entire body exhausted.

“Still… short of… two.”

An intermittent consciousness entered Qin Yu’s sea of consciousness, making him break out in cold sweat.

This dog actually included the killing of the bald donkey just now. However, at this moment, Qin Yu dared not bargain.

Qin Yu cursed in his heart.

Ji Tianming stood there stiffly, not daring to move.

“D*mn it! I’m still full of anger!”

Evil Eye!

Ghostly Sword slashed out and directly killed the Ji family’s Supreme Elder.

Ji Tianming was in a weak and helpless state at this moment. He did not even have the chance to struggle when this slash landed.

Ji Tianming died!

“Not bad, you even killed Wu Chang. Kid, you’re very interesting.”

A little girl with two braids suddenly appeared in front of Qin Yu. She was barefooted.

Her cheeks were red, and she held a wine pot in one hand.

“Burp!”

Qin Yu stared at the little girl who had suddenly appeared with a vigilant expression. One of his hands quietly gripped the ghostly sword.

The black Qin Yu was not worried as he had the corpse of the Yao family’s Immortal Emperor as a guard.

No matter how capable this little girl was, she could not pose a threat to him.

“Burp! This sword seems quite interesting.”

The little girl burped, and her red little face leaned against the ghostly sword and sniffed Evil Eye like a furry puppy.

Qin Yu’s hair instantly stood on end, and a chill ran down his spine.

What wicked evil was this? The ghostly sword he was holding was snatched away by her in an instant!

He immediately wanted to communicate with the Immortal Emperor’s corpse to kill this little girl who had appeared out of nowhere.

“Here you go. I’m returning it to you.”

The little girl sniffed it for a while before throwing the sword back to Qin Yu.

“Let’s go.”

In an instant, she disappeared again, leaving behind a bewildered Qin Yu.

“Forget it.”

At this moment, Jue Wu and Chang Mang, who had just arrived, were dumbfounded. They looked at the Ji family’s holy land which had already turned into ruins, and failed to react for a while.

“Hey, you guys, pick up everything here and hand them over to me.”

Qin Yu stared at them and said lazily.

“What’s wrong with you, Qin Yu?”

Jue Wu’s palm was about to hit Qin Yu’s back.

“Go to hell!”

Qin Yu’s pitch-black pupils revealed a cruel expression. The ghostly sword slashed directly at Jue Wu.

The Heart of Thunder!
