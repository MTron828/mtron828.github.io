Chapter 817: Chapter 817, the strongest expert in the second secret realm Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Qin Yu rushed back to the Divine Alchemist pavilion that day.

The death of Granny Qin made Qin Yu more or less uncomfortable.

Even though Qin Yu was a bloodthirsty person now, seeing the deep affection between mother and son still made Qin Yu somewhat moved.

Granny Qin is dead. I wonder if Xia hang can officially take over her position. Qin Yu couldn’t help but think to himself on the way back.

If Xia hang could take over Granny Qin’s position, then Qin Yu’s actions would naturally be much more convenient.

After returning to the Medicine God Pavilion, everyone already knew that Granny Qin was dead.

“Did you kill her?”Jiang he asked with some doubt.

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “No, it was the people from the Jingdu martial arts association who killed her.”

Jiang he was speechless. He sighed slightly and said, “To them, anyone can be a chess piece.”

Qin Yu had the same feeling. This high-ranking official was like a chess player. He never showed himself, but he controlled the entire game of go.

“At present, all the people I’ve met may not be their core figures,”Qin Yu said in a deep voice.

The true core might only be those few high-ranking officials.

But no one had seen the true faces of the high-ranking officials, even Granny Qin, who had sacrificed her life for the Jingdu Martial Arts Association.

“Right.”At this moment, Qin Yu seemed to have thought of something.

He looked at the pavilion master and Jiang he and said, “Do you think that the spirit binding technique will be recorded in the Jingdu Martial Arts Association’s Scripture Depository?”

The two looked at each other and said in a deep voice, “It’s hard to say, but even if it’s really recorded in the Scripture Depository, you won’t have the chance to go in.”

“Moreover, you’ve taken Yan Ruoxue away. The Jingdu Martial Arts Association is looking for you. Do you still dare to go back?”

Qin Yu sneered, “It’s already been a few days, but they still haven’t made a move. This means that they won’t do anything to me for the time being.”

“Or rather, they won’t be able to do anything to me for the time being.”

The pavilion master said in a low voice, “They’re waiting for your martial saint’s power to disappear.” Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“That’s right.”Qin Yu nodded.

“Although I can not be compared to a real martial saint with the power of a martial saint, I am not afraid of anyone below the level of a martial saint.”

“Since the Jingdu martial arts association is unable to send out a martial saint, then I am safe.”

Jiang he said with some doubt, “What about when your martial saint’s power disappears? How are you going to deal with it?”

“It’s true that the Jingdu martial arts association is unable to send out a martial saint, but it’s not difficult for them to become a half-step martial saint.”

Qin Yu nodded slightly and said, “That’s right, I’ve already made preparations.”

“Either I run away before the martial saint’s power disappears, or I step into the half-step martial saint realm before that.”

“Step into the half-step martial Saint Realm?”A trace of surprise flashed across Jiang he and the pavilion master’s faces.

In the current era, even a half-step martial saint had not appeared for a long time.

“In short, I’ve made preparations on both sides. Let’s take it one step at a time.”Qin Yu stood up and said.

“Oh right, pavilion master, which room is the young girl I brought back from the second mystery realm in?”Qin Yu asked.

The pavilion master said, “In the west side room.”

Qin Yu grunted and turned to leave.

After Qin Yu left, the pavilion master looked at Jiang he and said, “Old Mister Jiang, when do you plan to pass the nine secrets to Qin Yu?”

Jiang he was speechless. He said with some heartache, “To be honest, I really can’t bear to...”

The pavilion master smiled and said, “I won’t bring the spells with me even if I die. Besides, the nine secrets might be more useful in Qin Yu’s hands than in yours.”

...

In the west wing.

The young girl was crying all day long and looked extremely weak.

No one could imagine that a marquis Wu who could run amok in the world actually had the posture of a delicate woman.

At this time, Qin Yu pushed the door open and entered with big steps.

When she saw Qin Yu, a hint of panic flashed across the young girl’s face.

“Don’t be afraid, I won’t hurt you.”Qin Yu said with a faint smile.

He walked straight to the side of the girl and sat down. Then, he smiled and said, “I just want to ask you a few questions. You have to answer me truthfully.”

The girl hurriedly nodded. Her big eyes were full of fear.

“What’s Your Name?”Qin Yu asked.

The girl whispered, “My name is Little Qing...”

“Little Qing...”Qin Yu nodded slightly.

“Let me ask you, in the second secret realm, how many warriors are there, who is the strongest, what is his cultivation level, and...”. “A character like you, what kind of role do you play in the second mystery dimension?”Qin Yu threw out several questions in one breath.

Little Qing opened her mouth. She thought for a moment before speaking.

“I don’t know how many martial artists are in the second place, but the strongest one is a peak martial saint. We have never seen her before.”Little Qing said in a low voice.

“Peak martial saint...”Qin Yu could not help but frown.

“As for me... I’m just an ordinary person,”Xiao Qing said with a trembling voice.

After Xiao Qing’s simple narration, Qin Yu had a general understanding of the second secret realm.

The second secret realm had existed for many years, and the person who created it was not someone from the Jingdu Martial Arts Association.

Initially, this second secret realm was also an ownerless secret realm, but it had fallen into the hands of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association.

After many years of development, this second secret realm was like an extremely stable small world. It already had its own people.

“I think that peak martial saint must be a high-level figure of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association.”Qin Yu thought to himself.

At this moment, Qin Yu suddenly thought of something.

Perhaps the second secret realm was not its original name, but was named by the Jingdu Martial Arts Association itself.

If that was the case, didn’t it mean that there was also the first secret realm?

“Do you know the first secret realm?”Qin Yu looked at Little Qing and asked.

Little Qing shook his head, indicating that he knew nothing.

Qin Yu’s expression did not look too good.

If it really was as he had guessed, then the Jingdu martial arts association might be even more terrifying than he had imagined.

Qin Yu hurriedly took a piece of paper and a pen, and slowly drew a picture on the paper.

The person on this picture was the old man that Qin Yu had seen at Granny Qin’s house.

“Xiao Qing, the strongest person in the second secret realm that you mentioned, is it him?”Qin Yu handed the picture in his hand to Xiao Qing.

After taking the picture, Xiao Qing cried out, “Master Gu, it’s master Gu...”

“Master Gu?”Qin Yu frowned.

Xiao Qing explained, “He is indeed the strongest person in the second secret realm. His name is Gu Zizhen, and he is the owner of the second secret realm. We usually call him master Gu...”

Qin Yu nodded.

He picked up the picture and whispered, “It seems that the first secret realm really exists.”

Gu Zizhen had personally admitted that he was not a high-ranking official of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association, but only worked for the second secret realm.

And Gu Zizhen was the strongest expert of the second secret realm. This was enough to prove that the eight high-ranking officials of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association were not in the second secret realm at all!
