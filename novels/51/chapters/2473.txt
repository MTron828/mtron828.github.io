2474 The Sacrifice of the Path of Demon

Therefore, this was the ultimate truth of the Great Dao between heaven and earth, and countless dark emotions bred and flourished slowly under the “truth” of the Great Dao.

It spread out from the origin of Qin Yu’s divine sense like a deadly poison, causing Qin Yu’s dark brown soul power to turn even more intense red and look tremendously terrifying.

Similarly, the power of the Path of Heaven surrounded his body. The terrifying power even pushed Lei Xin and Flower Granny over, preventing them from getting near Qin Yu within a hundred meters.

“Slash!”

Qin Yu’s soul suddenly erupted with tremendous power, forcefully severing the connection between his soul and the altar.

In the blink of an eye, his body was drenched in cold sweat.

“What a terrifying power! This altar seems to have the consciousness of the monster race’s Path of Heaven. If I didn’t cut off my connection with the altar in time, I might have succumbed to evil under the influence of that consciousness.”

Qin Yu said in shock. He dared not touch this altar via his soul again.

The feeling just now was as if an unbeatable enemy was brainwashing him, attempting to replace his comprehension and thoughts with the theories of the monster race.

The change was a direct change of the origin of the soul because the power of the monster race emitted from the origin of the soul.

“I’ve taken a look just now, and the effect isn’t that great. It might be based on the fluctuation of an individual’s power of the soul.”

Flower Granny stared at Qin Yu and looked somewhat worried. “Don’t worry, Flower Granny. I’m fine.”

Qin Yu smiled speechlessly.

“Looks like we have come into contact with the core of the monster race. Otherwise, important altars would not be set up here.

Moreover, there are a total of six such altars. I think they are used for offering the human race.”

Lei Xin slammed his palm onto the altar.

The bright power of thunder and lightning instantly erupted when his palm came into contact with the altar. However, when the power of the thunder and lightning disappeared, the altar only fluctuated slightly. The power entered and then completely disappeared.

“Slash!”

Qin Yu held the ghostly sword and slashed horizontally.

However, when Evil Eye came into contact with the altar, the altar turned from solid to illusory. It was unable to cut through the actual body of the altar.

“What kind of method is this?”

Qin Yu was somewhat shocked. If that was the case, how could they destroy this altar?

Far away in the sky, suddenly, there was a fluctuation in space, and a figure slowly emerged from within.

The monster race would be shocked if they saw this.

At this moment, numerous monster race experts were guarding the sealed area. Even Asura Godly King was nearby. However, this person could avoid them and come to this vast land.

“Are you ready? The previous battle seemed to have impacted you significantly, haha!

“I will always be me. No matter what, no one can replace me. Moreover, only I can defeat Qin Yu.”

He Teng hovered in the air, sometimes revealing a sinister smile and other times emitting a furious roar.

While Qin Yu and the others were still discussing, they felt a wave of coldness and gloominess from their souls.

At this moment, the entire heaven and earth suddenly changed drastically. Sinister, evil, and corrupt forces permeated the space. Countless devilish laughter echoed through the air. People who had lived here for thousands or even tens of thousands of years let out enormous cries of fear, not understanding the sudden change of the heavens and earth.

The sound of chanting came from all directions slowly. Nearly 3,000 of the monster race were offering sacrifice, chanting the

incantation of the monster race.

“D*mn!. The monster race seems to be about to start their sacrificial ceremony. Moreover, the scale this time seems to be tremendously large.”

Nearly 3,000 of the monster race offering sacrifice was a terrifying number.

Previously, in the Crescent Moon Continent, only a few dozen monster race armies offered sacrifices, but they had attracted the terrifying power of the Path of Heaven. This time, with 3,000 of the monster race offering sacrifice, what kind of scale was this?

On the altar, tremendous exotic flames suddenly started burning. At the same time, massive flames rose in five other places.

The flame rose steadily, and in the end, it reached a height of several hundred meters.

A vast amount of black water flowed down from the altar like endless waterfalls, forming a vast passage on the ground that slowly? extended far into the distance.

As for the other altars, the same thing happened nearly like a mirror image.

The six massive black water streams connected, and a blood-red flame suddenly burned on the passage.

In an instant, an enormous hexagram flickered with a strange light and burned fiercely.

The worshipping monster race slowly walked out, and they split into six directions, slowly walking on the path of fire.

The power of the flames engulfed them instantly, soon burning them to ashes.

Until the moment before they turned into ashes, they were still chanting the monster race’s incantation loudly.

The six-winged monster race army followed behind the worshippers, walking on the flaming passageway, allowing the beautiful flames to turn their bodies into ashes.

An utmost pure demonic elemental energy flowed from where they turned into ashes in the black water and then the altar.

As more and more monster race worshippers and six-winged monster race walked up the passage, the flames strangely turned pitch-black.

The altar let out a buzzing sound, and a surge of energy suddenly rushed into the clouds.

In the sky, there seemed to be a colossal creature slowly awakening.

Dark clouds surrounded the entire continent, and an energy barrier appeared around the continent.

“D*mn! Stop them! They want to offer all the humans on this continent for the sacrifice!”

In the distance, the three golden lights ceased in an instant.

Wan Li held the prayer beads in his hand and punched at the altar with the wrath of the Vajra.

However, this power strangely penetrated through. Wan Kong and Wan Ming frowned as they looked at the altar. They turned their hands and attacked the monster race who self-sacrificed their lives.

A blood-red light appeared, and the river of blood surged forward tumultuously and overwhelmingly. A malicious force extended far and wide, and corpses floated for thousands of miles. As the crimson hue receded, their attacks were completely devoured when they landed.

The Blood River Banner! The supreme treasure of the demon race actually appeared here! It was definitely going to kill all living beings!

Wan Li’s face was full of tremendous rage. This Blood River Banner was a banner that the most elite monster race army carried on their expeditions. It had absorbed an unknown amount of blood qi. With this banner, it was impossible to break through and attack the monster race offering the sacrifice.

No wonder the Moon Demon Godly King was so calm. He merely guarded the 5,000 human race women and had no intention of following them.

“Kill!”

Four Buddhas Eliminating Sin!

Wan Li’s Four Buddhas Eliminating Sin attacked the monster race worshippers again. The others also attacked in an instant.

These monster race worshippers were the key. As long as they could kill these monster race worshippers, this Path of Heaven sacrifice might be canceled.
