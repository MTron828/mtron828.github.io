That was the power of vessel. At this moment, Zhuang Zhou Butterflies which were sealed in the container, slowly dissipated. The Order of Vessel surged out and captured the power of the Seal of Heaven Returning.

The two Seal of Heaven Returning lit up at the same time, frantically resisting the unseen power.

That power pulled Qin Yu into a completely dark abyss. The two Orders of

Reversal wanted to reverse this power and give Qin Yu a chance of survival.

At this moment, the third Heart of Saint Kingdom lit up again. This Heart of Saint Kingdom was obtained by Hua Tian.

Order of Saint Kingdom, the Shield of God.

During the fight with Qin Yu just now, Hua Tian did not even use this skill and was directly killed by Qin Yu.

At this moment, Qin Yu was in danger. The Heart of Saint Kingdom that he had just obtained after killing Hua Tian also activated itself, wanting to protect Qin Yu.

In the void, a five-star radiance appeared above Qin Yu’s head. Following the array, it turned into a hollow void.

A rusty shield slowly shuttled out from within. As the shield appeared, the sounds of battle from the ancient battlefield instantly resounded throughout the entire Demon Sealing Valley.

However, even the three Hearts of Saint Kingdom could not withstand the power.

The power of death was no longer something that the power of Saint Kingdom could withstand. In the next moment, Qin Yu’s body turned into nothingness, and there was no longer a trace of him.

The three Hearts of Saint Kingdom lost all their light and returned to silence.

“Qin Yu!”

Blood slowly seeped out of the wound on the peak master’s face as he clenched his fists tightly.

“Sigh.”

Dan sighed softly. Although he had expected this result, he couldn’t help but sigh when he saw it with his own eyes.

They missed the best opportunity and chose the wrong person.

At this moment, Dan, who was holding the Saint Kingdom’s Book of Earth, could feel the terrifying pressure from Wu Tian.

“Alright, I’ve completed the task that Emerald Serpent Witch assigned me.

Now, I’m going to settle my karma with the Demon Sealing Valley.”

Wu Tian slowly opened his eyes.

“Wu Tian, you are not from this world. Chen Shuang sealed you because of the agreement of the Saints. Now that Chen Shuang is dead, why do you want to kill the Demon Sealing Valley? The power of the Demon Sealing Valley is nothing to you.”

Elder Xin Yue appeared outside the Demon Sealing Valley and said with a bitter smile.

“Although your strength is not worth mentioning, I was sealed here. The

Demon Sealing Valley is the place where you guard and suppress me. The

Demon Sealing Valley even wants to use my body to refine magical artifacts.”

Wu Tian said with a smile. His gaze fell on Gu Yi, making him feel a little awkward.

“I will only attack once. The rest will be the grudges between you and these demons. ”

Wu Tian said with a smile.

The twelfth-grade Black Lotus of Annihilation in his hand slowly rotated. In an instant, a strong wind blew in the entire area.

The water vapor in the Demon Sealing Valley completely evaporated. The vacuum area allowed the surrounding air to enter violently.

This terrifying gale even caused the sturdy pavilion to be directly pulled back and sent flying.

Flames slowly burned on the black lotus.

At this moment, all the hottest flames in the Saint Kingdom seemed to have received an order. Countless flames gathered towards the black lotus.

Wu Tian’s right hand was like a burning sun. The walls of the Demon Sealing Valley were melting under the heat.

Even though the Book of Earth of the Saint Kingdom was in front of everyone, Dan and the elders’ faces were still red from the heat.

“All disciples, pour all your power into the Saint Kingdom’s Book of Earth. The rest of the commoners can leave.”

He looked at the Demon Sealing Valley which was gradually melting before it erupted.

Dan gave the order with a bitter smile. The entire Demon Sealing Valley was filled with the wails of ghosts and the howls of wolves.

The scene was extremely terrifying. The area near the Angry Buddha Lotus Flame that was tens of thousands of meters away from the Demon Sealing Valley slowly melted like ice cream.

Dan couldn’t help but smile bitterly. The difference in strength was too great.

Even with the Saint Kingdom’s Book of Earth, they still stood no chance against Wu Tian. All they could do now was try their best.

“Go, Angry Buddha Lotus Flame! Explode!”

The compressed fire lotus in Wu Tian’s hand slowly flew toward the Demon Sealing Valley.

“Hahaha! Although I’ve been in the Demon Sealing Valley my entire life, it’s enough for me to live in this Saint Kingdom and get to know so many fellow disciples. If it wasn’t for this Saint Kingdom, there wouldn’t be the Demon

Sealing Valley, and there wouldn’t be me either.”

Xin Yue laughed loudly, and three true fires ignited on her body.

Pure Saint Power surged out of her body, and this power that contained all of her Saint Power rushed into the Saint Kingdom’s Book of Earth.

She was so determined that she did not even plan to leave her corpse behind.

“Xin Yue, you go first. I’ll be right behind you.”

Dan said softly.

“Hahaha! Elder Xin Yue has won first place. What should I say?”

Xuan De shook his head with a bitter smile. The fire also lit up on his body. He also turned into pure holy energy and rushed into the Saint Kingdom’s Book of Earth.Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Master, we’re here too.”

Jing Xin and Ling’er also burned their divine souls without hesitation.

More and more people followed Xin Yue’s footsteps, turning all their cultivation into the purest Saint Power and entering the Saint Kingdom’s Book of Earth.

The Saint Kingdom’s Book of Earth emitted a dazzling light. A huge shadow rose from the ground.

It was an extremely thick yellow sand power, which was also the foundation of this Book of Earth and the membrane of the Saint Kingdom.

The earth membrane wrapped around the Angry Buddha Lotus Flame. In just a few seconds, countless disciples had rushed into the Book of Earth. Gu Yi, Gu Tian, and a few others stared at the scene in front of them with pale faces.

They were stunned for a moment. They did not expect things to turn out this way.

“Everyone has their aspirations. Forget it…”

Dan looked at Gu Yi and shook his head slightly.

Flames also burned on his body, turning him into the largest holy energy and entering the Book of Earth.

Boom!

The Angry Buddha Lotus Flame suddenly expanded to hundreds of times its original size. Terrifying heat waves rolled within the earth’s membrane, roaring and attacking like a fire dragon.

In an instant, half of the Demon Sealing Valley disappeared. The Saint

Kingdom’s Book of Earth fell to the ground, and a gust of wind blew past.

The book was turned into ashes, and the earth membrane fell back into the ground as if it had suffered great damage.

All the living beings in the Saint Kingdom seemed to have sensed some changes in the land of the Saint Kingdom.

The huge forest trees that were originally resplendent suddenly became dispirited.

“Such decisiveness. This is the ambition of the Daoist…”

Wu Tian put away the black lotus and looked at the half-melted Demon Sealing Valley in silence for a long time. He suddenly remembered his fellow disciples who had once fought hard for Buddhism..
