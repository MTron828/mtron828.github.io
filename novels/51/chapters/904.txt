Chapter 905: Chapter 905, the secret realm of the Yan Family? 

Qin Yu’s expression suddenly changed drastically!

He hurriedly lowered his head and restrained his internal Qi to the maximum.

At this moment, Qin Yu’s head was covered in cold sweat.

If he was discovered by Zhai Xing, he would definitely die!

Zhai Xing looked in Qin Yu’s direction and did not speak for a long time.

“Lord Zhai Xing, What’s Wrong?”A marquis from the side asked softly.

Zhai Xing was silent for a moment, then he shook his head and said, “Nothing, let’s go.”

Qin Yu could not help but heave a sigh of relief when he led everyone away.

However, he still did not dare to move recklessly, afraid that Zhai Xing would turn back.

After a full half an hour, Qin Yu finally heaved a sigh of relief after he confirmed that Zhai Xing had left.

“Strange,”Qin Yu muttered in a low voice.

“Could it be that he did not discover me?”

The martial saint’s spiritual sense was extremely sharp. A half-step martial saint could not hide in front of him at all.

Could it be that there was something wrong with Zhai Xing’s spiritual sense?

“Forget it, I don’t want to think about it.”Qin Yu waved his hand.

As long as he was not discovered, it was fine.

Thus, Qin Yu got up, boarded the boatman’s boat, and headed towards the opposite shore.

More than an hour later.

Qin Yu finally successfully landed on the opposite shore.

After getting off the boat, Qin Yu looked at the large mountain forest a few kilometers ahead.

There was a scenic area around this mountain forest. After crossing this scenic area, there was no one there.

Qin Yu did not waste any time. He pressed down his hat and walked quickly to the mountain forest.

Soon, Qin Yu arrived at Jiang he’s residence.

Jiang he, who was cultivating, opened his eyes slightly.

He looked in Qin Yu’s direction, and a trace of doubt flashed in his eyes.

“Qin Yu?”Jiang he shouted tentatively.

Qin Yu walked out quickly, bowed, and said, “Greetings, senior Jiang He.”

Jiang he was even more surprised.

He stood up from the ground and said, “Why are you here?”

Qin Yu smiled bitterly and said, “I’m here to learn from you.”

Jiang he seemed to have stepped on something.

He stroked his beard and said with a smile, “You want to learn the nine secrets?”

“Yes.”Qin Yu didn’t hide anything.

He told Jiang he what had happened during this period of time.

After Jiang he heard it, he was somewhat surprised.

“Yan Ruoxue was taken away? And she seems to be an expert at the Almighty Realm?”Jiang he was also extremely surprised.

Qin Yu sighed and said, “Well, in any case, I have no power to fight back in front of him. I don’t even know how I fainted.”

Jiang he fell into a short period of silence.

A moment later, he stood up and said, “Maybe you can ask Old Mister Yan about this matter.”

At the mention of Old Mister Yan, Qin Yu suddenly thought of something.

“Is she really from the Yan family’s secret realm?”Qin Yu said in surprise.

Jiang he slowly sighed and said, “If he’s really in the Almighty Realm, I’m afraid it’s not a secret realm.”

“What do you mean?”Qin Yu hurriedly asked.

Jiang he waved his hand and didn’t explain.

“By the way, I saw Zhai Xing on the other side just now.”At this time, Qin Yu suddenly thought of something.

Jiang he frowned slightly and said in a cold voice, “Zhai Xing? You met Zhai Xing?”

“I don’t know what to say either,”Qin Yu said with a bitter smile.

He told Jiang he what had happened.

After Jiang he heard it, he didn’t say anything for a while.

“With Zhai Xing’s ability, it’s not a problem for him to find me, but he just took a look and left,”Qin Yu said in a low voice.

Jiang he sighed slowly and said, “He also let me go back then.”

Qin Yu immediately sucked in a breath of cold air.

“He also let you go? ! What... What the hell is going on? !”Qin Yu widened his eyes.

Jiang he didn’t explain, only saying, “Zhai Xing is a person who cherishes talents. Maybe he wants to let you go.”

After saying that, Jiang he stopped talking about this matter.

“Come, I will teach you the nine secrets now,”said Jiang he.

Qin Yu didn’t waste any time and immediately nodded.

“The nine secrets is the ultimate art of Taoism. It’s not only in the present world, but also in the immortal cultivation world. It’s a top-notch technique,”said Jiang he.

“It’s extremely difficult to comprehend this kind of technique. It doesn’t depend on talent, but on fate.”

“Only those who are fated can learn the nine secrets.”

Qin Yu nodded seriously and said, “Senior Jiang he, I understand. I’ll do my best.”

“Yes. Even if it’s fated, it will take a long time to learn the nine secrets,”Jiang he continued.

“It took me half a month to learn the nine secrets.”

Qin Yu nodded repeatedly. No matter how much time it took, Qin Yu had to learn it.

Therefore, Jiang he didn’t say anything more. He sat cross-legged on the ground and then extended his spiritual sense through the space between his eyebrows.

“My spiritual sense will enter your spiritual sense through your glabella and use it to teach you. Don’t resist at all, or else my spiritual sense might fall out,”Jiang he warned.

“Yes, senior Jiang He.”Qin Yu hurriedly nodded.

That strand of spiritual sense landed on Qin Yu’s glabella. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Qin Yu closed his eyes slightly. Soon, Jiang he’s figure appeared in his mind.

Qin Yu’s mind was filled with a golden light. That golden light transformed into Qin Yu’s appearance and began to receive the teachings of Jiang he’s spiritual sense.

...

In the conference room of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association.

“I was unable to capture Jiang he,”Zhai Xing said in a deep voice.

Gu Xinghe frowned.

“Uncle Zhai Xing, you are at the advanced stage of the Martial Saint Realm. How did a half-step martial saint escape from your hands?”Gu Xinghe could not help but ask in puzzlement.

Zhai xing bowed and said, “Jiang he has mastered the nine secrets. His speed is above mine.”

Upon hearing these words, Gu Xinghe frowned slightly as if he was somewhat suspicious.

“Hehe...”

At this moment, a sinister voice came from the side.

This voice was none other than he teng.

At this moment, he teng had become even stranger. His entire body was wrapped in a black robe, and his body emitted a rotten aura.

“I once saw Lord Zhai Xing’s figure in an ancient book...”He Teng said with a sinister tone.

“According to the ancient book, Lord Zhai Xing had many followers back then, and most of them were young geniuses. The book says that you are a person who cherishes talents very much...”

“It is precisely because of this reason that the Guardian let you off. I didn’t say that, did I, Lord Zhai Xing...”

Zhai Xing glanced at he teng coldly and said, “What do you want to say?”

He Teng said with a strange voice, “Back then, you seemed to have let Jiang he off once, making Jiang he, who should have died at your hands, become the number one person below the martial saint...”

“What exactly do you want to say?”Zhai Xing’s tone was also somewhat cold.

He Teng said with a smile, “Lord Zhai Xing, you should know what I want to say in your heart...”

Zhai Xing narrowed his eyes. He suddenly stretched out his hand and slapped toward he teng!

He Teng’s body was instantly sent flying and he crashed into the wall!

A mouthful of blood spurted out from his mouth like a fountain!

“Who do you think you are? How dare you talk nonsense in front of me,”Zhai Xing said coldly.

“If the person in your body still wants to live, then pay attention to the tone in which you speak to me.”

Hearing this, he teng’s body trembled slightly.

He got up from the ground and cupped his hands to look at Gu Xinghe.

“Young master Gu, leave Jiang he’s matter to me, how about it?”He Teng said darkly.

Gu Xinghe raised his brows and said with some amusement, “You? A half-step martial saint went to capture Jiang he?”

“Under the same realm, why should I be afraid of him...”he teng said in a hoarse voice.

Gu Xinghe’s interest was piqued.

“Okay, if you can catch Jiang he, I will reward you handsomely!”Gu Xinghe said excitedly.

“No need... you just need to let me handle Jiang he...”he teng said.

Gu Xinghe thought for a moment and nodded. “Okay! But I will only give you three days!”

“Okay, three days is enough,”he teng said coldly.
