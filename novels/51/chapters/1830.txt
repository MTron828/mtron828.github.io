1831 The Power of Saint Weapon

The two cultivators of the Tong family looked at Jue Wu with mocking expressions. The mockery in their eyes was very obvious.

“Holy Power is not to be humiliated. No matter how strong you are, it’s useless,” one of them said indifferently.

Jue Wu grabbed the Glided Rake single-handedly. She supported her body and stood up with difficulty.

Just as they said, the Holy Power’s power was too terrifying. Even just a wisp of it almost killed Jue Wu.

“You’re still alive, not bad,” another person said.

“Then let’s give her a fatal blow.”

After saying that, the black copper bell in his hand shone again.

Wisps of Holy Power gathered on the copper bell.

The space in the surroundings instantly distorted. A powerful internal qi swept up gales in the surroundings as if the sky was falling and the earth was splitting.

At this moment, a more dazzling purple light suddenly emitted from Jue Wu’s palm!

This light lingered around the Glided Rake, and in an instant, the color of the Glided Rake became extremely strange!

The original golden radiance began to flicker with traces of silver! Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

The moment this silver light appeared, a similar Holy Power began to spread!

“Eh?”

The two people from the Tong family couldn’t help but feel shocked when they saw what happened.

Unfortunately, the Gilded Rake soon resumed its golden color. And the wisps of Holy Power that lingered on it disappeared without a trace.

“Boom!”

Jue Wu grabbed the Golden Rake in her hand, and smashed it down as if she was splitting the heavens and earth!

Even though the Holy Power had disappeared, this attack still contained the terrifying power of the purple cloud pearl!

“It’s no use!” one of them said coldly.

“Under the power of the Holy Power, all must die!”

He slapped the copper bell forward, and the Holy Power spread out again, pressing directly toward Jue Wu!

Jue Wu grabbed the Glided Rake tightly, and purple light constantly filled the air!

A terrifying scene appeared. The Glided Rake actually pierced through the wisp of Holy Power and pressed toward the two of them!

“What?”

Upon seeing this scene, the two men’s expressions changed drastically!

Jue Wu had actually penetrated the Holy Power. It was so terrifying!

“Boom!”

A wisp of internal qi from the Glided Rake slashed toward the two of them, forcing them to retreat. One of them was even hit in the face by it and bleeding profusely!

However, after this attack, Jue Wu lost all her strength and fell to the ground.

“You’re courting death!” The cultivator who had been hit was covered in blood and was extremely angry!

He held the black copper bell and rushed toward Jue Wu, wanting to give her the final blow!

But at this moment, the cultivator next to him stopped him.

“There’s no point in killing her,” he said coldly.

“What do you mean?” the other man asked angrily.

“What’s the point of killing her now? It’s better to take her back and force Qin Yu to show up,” the cultivator continued.

He held the black copper bell in his hand and said indifferently, “If we continue, we might really anger Thunder Courtyard. It’s not worthwhile.

“But if we take Jue Wu back to the Tong family and force Qin Yu to show up, Thunder Courtyard will have nothing to say.”

After hearing this, the cultivator who had been seriously injured by Jue Wu fell into silence.

“Then I’ll spare her life for now. I’ll kill her sooner or later!” the cultivator gritted his teeth and said.

The cultivator beside him didn’t say anything else. He stretched out his hand, and the black copper bell in his hand covered Jue Wu, suppressing her.

Therefore, even if Jue Wu had great ability, she couldn’t escape.

In the copper bell, Jue Wu, who was seriously injured, slowly opened her eyes.

She wasn’t afraid of the current situation at all. Instead, she looked relaxed, as if everything was within her calculations.

…

The following day, when everyone from Demon-slaying Peak gathered again, they found no trace of Jue Wu.

After searching for a while, they still couldn’t find Jue Wu.

“It seems that Jue Wu has left Thunder Courtyard,” someone said.

“That’s right. With Jue Wu’s character, she would definitely be unwilling to accept a favor from others for nothing,” Cao Huang stood out and said.

Xiaobai said in a deep voice,” Jue Wu definitely doesn’t want everyone to sacrifice their points in exchange for her safety. Therefore… She’s probably dead now.”

Everyone’s expression turned ugly.

Jiu Xiao’s face darkened.

He felt a little guilty. If he had decided to exchange for the Saint Weapon earlier yesterday, such a tragedy would not have happened today.

At this moment, a beam of light suddenly pierced through the void and shot over!

Jiu Xiao stretched out his hand and caught it in his hand.

He was holding a piece of paper in his palm.

After opening up the note, a few large words floated up.

“If you don’t want anything to happen to Jue Wu, let Qin Yu come to the Tong family alone.”

These few words instantly enraged the entire Demon-slaying Peak.

“As expected! Jue Wu has been taken away by them!”

“This bunch of b*stards! They’re doing things that please them with the Saint Weapon in their hands!”

Just as everyone was furious, the peak master at the side shook his head and said, “At least it means that Jue Wu is safe for the time being.”

After the peak master’s reminder, everyone seemed to have come back to their senses.

“But they’ve asked Qin Yu to go to the Tong family. This… We have no way to tell Qin Yu about it.”

“That’s right. If they can’t wait for Qin Yu, won’t they kill Jue Wu?”

The peak master glanced at the crowd and said in a deep voice, “ll ask someone to send them a letter telling them that Qin Yu is in closed-door seclusion.

“After a year, Qin Yu will go to visit them.”

After hearing the peak master’s words, someone asked doubtfully, “Will the Tong family wait for him? Do they have such patience?”

“That’s right. What if they’re desperate?” the others were puzzled and said.

“Whether they have the patience or not, they have no other choice,” the peak master said coldly.

“Everyone, don’t worry. Before Qin Yu shows up, Jue Wu is still valuable in their hands. Thus nothing will happen.”

“Moreover, a year isn’t that long. I believe they will make the right decision.”

Upon hearing this, everyone fell into silence.

This might be the only choice at the moment. Thunder Courtyard would never send someone to the Tong family to save her because it was against the rules of Thunder Courtyard.

After much consideration, everyone finally agreed to the peak master’s proposal.

With the peak master’s connections, it was not difficult to get someone to send the letter.

On that day, the peak master wrote a letter and sent it to the Tong family.

The letter was soon delivered to the Tong family.

In the Tong family’s hall, Young Master Tong looked at the letter in his hand and said coldly, “One year? Who the hell would be willing to wait for him for one year? After a year, it’ll be too late!”

Someone from the side came forward and asked, “Young Master, what should we do?”

“Kill that Jue Wu!” Tong Guangqing said gloomily.

“I must force Qin Yu to show up!”
