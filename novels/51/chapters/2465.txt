2466 Gloomy Future

Humans had to proactively repent before being forgiven.

“Dean, Flower Granny, I have another question. That person seemed to be able to use the power of the Path of Heaven of the human race just now, but his body was demonized. What happened?” Qin Yu was still somewhat puzzled by Gao Lan’s demonization just now.

“Becoming a demon with a thought is the unique way of the monster race. The power of the Path of Heaven of the monster race includes the five greatest ways of chaos, slaughter, darkness, war, and death. The moment one can sense these ways of the monster race, one’s soul has been demonized. In fact, one has already become a member of the monster race.”

Qin Yu nodded and roughly understood the order of the Path of Heaven of the monster race.

Besides the living beings born in the monster realm, those from the human and the demon races could also cultivate demonic techniques and sense the Path of Heaven of the monster race.

Once it reaches this level, this living being will bring chaos, slaughter, darkness, war, and death to the universe. After this, this living being will naturally be recognized by the Path of Heaven of the monster race.

“Gao Lan’s body just now should have been aided by the power of sacrifice. The monster race’s Path of Heaven can directly instill energy into the body. It can only forcefully increase the physical energy or seal the power into the body. It can’t directly help the monster race improve their comprehension of the Path of Heaven.”

It was the same for the four-winged monster race they encountered before. Their physical bodies could directly clash with the power of the human race’s Path of Heaven.

Suddenly, Chen Zhisha moved.

Flower Granny struck out with her palm. Countless petals fell from the sky, turning from green to yellow. A palm pierced out from within and landed on Chen Zhisha’s body.

“The power of time?”

Chen Zhisha frowned slightly. He put his palms together, and the Buddha’s light on his body was like a gentle palm.

He stirred up the power of time and then moved his palm slightly.

With a loud buzz, the power of time was sent back at an even faster speed.

“Yin and Yang Road!”

Almost instantly, Qin Yu appeared in front of Flower Granny, and the massive sword energy slashed the power of time apart.

“Who exactly are you? You’re definitely not from the Ten Thousand Budhha Sect. Ten Thousand Buddha Sect has one of the few humans who can sense the heavenly monster race, especially someone with your strength. You should be able to tell Gao Lan is a member of the monster race. Are you also a member of the monster race?”

Flower Granny said coldly.

Chen Zhisha did not seem surprised by her attack just now. He even sighed a little, which Flower Granny also noticed. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

The Soul-hunting Bell let out a hollow ringing sound. Qin Yu’s divine sense locked onto Chen Zhisha firmly, ready to attack at any time.

“You can save these 300,000 people or so, but can you save hundreds of millions of humans? The power of the Path of Heaven cannot be reversed by human strength. The human race can’t win this battle. What we can do is to preserve a trace of the human race’s tinder to the greatest extent.”

Chen Zhisha waved his arm, and countless plane images appeared before them.

Countless monster race armies were fighting in countless planes. Two-winged monster race, four-winged monster race, eight-winged monster race, and even more powerful monster race elites. Each of these people carried a destructive internal qi, and wherever they went, the human race was filled with wails.

In the ghost realm, a vast number of the monster race living beings entered the human world. After countless humans died, their divine souls returned to the ghost realm. They then reincarnated and formed tremendously powerful combat strength, and once again they fought in the human world.

In the demon world, the demon race had a vast number of demonic beasts, including ancient divine beasts. Wherever they went, humans were powerless to resist.

Among the Path of Heaven of the four races, the human race’s Path of Heaven, which had been suppressed and reduced in size, appeared very clearly before everyone.

“After seeing these, do you have anything else to say?”

Chen Zhisha said calmly.

“F*ck them. This is a war between races. If we don’t kill them, do you want to surrender?” Chang Mang punched the ground.

The fleeting scene just now had already reflected the tragic fate of the human race.

There were living beings in the human race in millions of planes. Such a tragic war had appeared in all parts of the universe. Even if some supreme experts wanted to stop it, they were powerless to resist such a trend.

“Then what do you think?”

Qin Yu asked coldly.

He could no longer tell whether Chen Zhisha was possessed by the heavenly monster race or if this was his idea.

There was a world of difference from the Chen Zhisha that did not even kill the monster race.

“Yesterday’s cause results in today’s effect. At that time, the human race’s Heavenly Emperor tried to break the Path of Heaven and rush out of the Path of Heaven with the entire Human Race. Although he did not succeed, the Path of Heaven had also planted the seeds of danger for the human race. If the chaos this time is bad, I’m afraid that even the tinder of the human race will disappear.”

Chen Zhisha was still as calm as ever as if nothing would change his state of mind.

“Are you saying that the human race might be exterminated?”

Chang Mang said in disbelief.

“Based on the current situation, it’s very likely. If you were to observe from the side, you might trigger the Path of Heaven’s intervention and keep the tinder… For example, this time, if you attack and kill the heavenly monster race, it’s unknown whether it’s a disaster or a blessing.”

“Get lost.”

Qin Yu raised his Evil Eye and pointed the tip of his sword at Chen Zhisha.

“I’m making a move.”

Chen Zhisha bowed and took a step back. He turned into dust and disappeared in front of everyone.

“What a powerful person! In the Ten Thousand Buddha Sect, which has four sects, four schools, and two saints, he must be a reputable person. To be able to erase the power of time easily and bounce back, he must be at least at the Peak of Tribulation Fifth Level.”

Flower Granny was secretly shocked. If it was someone at the Tribulation Fourth or Fifth level, he would have reached his limits to withstand it.

However, after receiving the attack, Chen Zhisha could actually bounce back. This made Flower Granny feel tremendously shocked.

“Do you think this person is possessed by a heavenly monster?” Jue Wu asked curiously.

“I would rather he’s possessed by a heavenly monster. Otherwise, given his strength, it is likely that he has discovered some tremendously bad things by saying these words. To be able to make the people of the Buddhist Sect unwilling to convert even 300,000 human beings, just what kind of future is this?”

Flower Granny sighed. The conversation with Chen Zhisha was like a massive rock pressing down on her chest.

“We’ll deal with whatever comes our way. Even if what he said is true, I’ll have to overcome it. If I really let these 300,000 people be under the control of the monster race, I’m afraid they’ll turn into ashes sooner or later.”

Qin Yu said with a frown. He did not care about what would happen in the future, but he had to do his best to stop it now.

“Good disciple, well said! At most, I’ll just return my life to the human world. What’s the big deal?”

Lei Xin laughed loudly.

“Let’s temporarily stay here for a while. What Chen Zhisha said makes sense. A single death of the heavenly monster race will attract the attention of the higher-ups of the monster race. If they set their eyes on this place, I’m afraid it’s difficult for us to hide despite the formation we set up earlier.”

Qin Yu thought for a moment and decided to stay on this mainland first.
