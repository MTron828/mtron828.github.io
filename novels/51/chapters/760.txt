Chapter 761: On the Eve of the Great Battle Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Yan Jinyao’s palm struck fiercely at Xiao Yu.

Qin Yu had expected that Yan Jinyao would do this, so he had long been prepared.

Just as Yan Jinyao’s palm was about to touch Qin Yu, Qin Yu strode forward and raised his hand to block him.

However, Yan Jinyao took a step further. He raised his other palm in advance to meet Qin Yu!

Qin Yu’s expression immediately changed!

He never expected that Yan Jinyao had actually prepared a counterattack in advance!

That palm struck towards Xiao Yu.

Xiao Yu, who had just entered the Martial Marquis realm, couldn’t avoid it at all!

“Xiao Yu!” Qin Yu shouted in shock!

That palm ruthlessly struck towards Xiao Yu’s body.

Just as the palm was about to touch Xiao Yu, her body suddenly exploded with a burst of bright light!

The light suddenly appeared, and a terrifying power instantly poured out.

“Boom!”

The enormous power instantly sent Yan Jinyao flying!

His body staggered back more than ten steps before he stabilized his body, and blood surged up from his chest.

Everyone present was stunned.

Even Qin Yu was dumbstruck.

He hurriedly walked to Xiao Yu’s side and asked worriedly, “Xiao Yu, are you okay?”

Xiao Yu shook her head, indicating that she was fine.

“Protective Dharma Treasure?” Yan Jinyao thought that Xiao Yu had a Protective Dharma Treasure on her.

He looked at Qin Yu coldly and said through gritted teeth, “Qin Yu, I will remember this slap.”

After saying this, Yan Jinyao turned his head and left quickly.

It wasn’t until he reached a place where no one was around that Yan Jinyao spat out a mouthful of blood!

“How did this happen...” Yan Jinyao’s face was a little pale.

This attack seemed to have injured him internally.

...

“Xiao Yu, how did you do that just now?” Qin Yu asked in surprise.

Xiao Yu shook his head and said, “I didn’t do anything.”

Qin Yu immediately fell into silence.

He subconsciously looked at the man with the mustache.

“Have you grown to such a stage?” The man with the mustache muttered in a low voice.

Qin Yu pulled the man with the mustache and walked to the side.

“What’s going on? What’s that light on Xiao Yu’s body?” Qin Yu asked.

The man with the mustache touched his chin and said, “You should have guessed it. Why are you asking me?”

Qin Yu frowned and said, “Is it related to the masked woman?”

“Yes.” The man with the mustache nodded.

“But... didn’t you say that the masked woman has been reborn many times, but the chances of her growing more powerful are very low?” Qin Yu was a little puzzled.

The man with the mustache nodded and said, “That’s right. This is definitely not her first reincarnation, but there aren’t many records about her in history, so this is enough to prove that she has grown more powerful very few times.”

“But now... it can only be said that she has grown to the stage where she has the consciousness to protect herself.”

At this point, the man with the mustache couldn’t help but sigh.

“I’m afraid that another devil will appear in this world. When that time comes, it will definitely be a disaster,” the man with the mustache muttered softly.

Seeing the man with the mustache’s expression, Qin Yu was also a little worried.

He didn’t understand the masked woman, but from the various signs on Xiao Yu’s body, he knew that this masked woman was definitely not a good person.

“I have to go to the Scripture Pavilion as soon as possible,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

...

There was only a short day left before he had to fight with Blackie.

For the rest of the time, Qin Yu didn’t leave his house.

Because his residence had been destroyed, Qin Yu could only temporarily stay in the mansion with the man with the mustache.

At this moment, in a Mystic Realm of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association.

A ray of light flashed, and then two figures walked out of the light.

These two were none other than Granny Qin and Blackie.

Blackie’s body was exuding a simple internal qi. This internal qi carried a strong sense of oppression.

Granny Qin looked at Blackie and asked, “Blackie, how do you feel now?”

Blackie replied in a deep voice, “With your help, I have absolute confidence in killing Qin Yu.”

Granny Qin nodded slightly and smiled kindly. “That’s good. Blackie, remember to kill Qin Yu no matter what. Don’t hold back.”

Blackie bowed slightly and said, “Granny Qin, don’t worry.”

At this point, Granny Qin reminded, “Also, unless it’s absolutely necessary, try not to use their power.” 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Blackie looked at Granny Qin, deep in thought.

Granny Qin explained, “Blackie, in their eyes, you might be just a tool, a chess piece. So I can’t guarantee that if you use their power, there will be no side effects.”

“But in my eyes, you are my child. I won’t allow any mishaps to happen to you.” Granny Qin’s eyes were filled with kindness.

Blackie nodded and said, “Granny Qin, I understand.”

Then, the two returned to the martial arts academy.

At night.

Qin Yu’s cultivation was finally over.

He stood up from the ground and said in a low voice, “There shouldn’t be any problems.”

The man with the mustache came over and said, “Qin Yu, how about... I lend you the purple-gold calabash first?”

Qin Yu waved his hand and said, “No need.”

“You’re that confident?” The man with the mustache looked a little surprised.

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “It’s not confidence. The rules are in their hands. No one knows if they will allow the use of magic artifacts.”

“Moreover... this purple-gold calabash is so precious. Once it appears, I can’t guarantee that they won’t snatch it away.”

The man with the mustache seemed to think that it made sense.

He nodded and said, “Then be careful.”

Qin Yu grunted and didn’t say anything more.

Just as Qin Yu was about to go to sleep, several figures suddenly appeared at the door.

These people were none other than Yan Jinyao and his disciples.

The few of them stood at the door and quietly looked at Qin Yu.

Qin Yu frowned slightly. He walked forward and said, “Yan Jinyao? What are you doing here?”

Yan Jinyao said indifferently, “Qin Yu, the world has been talking about who is stronger and who is weaker between you and me. I think this matter should be settled.”

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes slightly and sneered. “Why? Do you want to fight with me?”

“No.” Yan Jinyao shook his head.

“Your current opponent is Blackie. I won’t take advantage of him.”

Qin Yu raised his eyebrows and said, “Oh yeah? Then what do you mean?”

Yan Jinyao said, “I’ll send my disciple to fight.”

Hearing that, Qin Yu couldn’t help but sneer. “Yan Jinyao, are you crazy?”

Yan Jinyao sneered. “Outsiders say that you and I are equal, but in my eyes, you are bullsh*t. You are only worthy to fight with my disciple.”

Hearing Yan Jinyao’s words, Qin Yu couldn’t help but snicker. “Yan Jinyao, if you really want to compete with me, after I kill Blackie, I will accompany you.”

“No, no, no. Only after you win against my disciple are you qualified to fight with me.” Yan Jinyao sneered.

“Oh, by the way, let me tell you in advance. If you die tomorrow, everyone will be safe and sound.”

“If you are alive tomorrow, my disciple will immediately challenge you. Whether you accept or not, it’s up to you.”
