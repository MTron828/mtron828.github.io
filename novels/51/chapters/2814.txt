Chapter 2815: Saint Kingdom’s Undercurrent

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio  Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Thus, the Alester family used all their strength to injure the two Saints without caring about their losses before the other Saints arrived. After that, they abandoned most of the family’s treasures and directly brought the core ten people into the Dao Mystical Saint Kingdom. The others used this as bait to continue resisting. Only when another Saint arrived did they find out they had been deceived.

Hiss!

Qin Yu gasped. One had to know that the Alester family did not have many Dharma Treasures like the Situ family.

To be able to defeat two Holy Lords head-on with their strength, one could imagine how terrifying the strength of the family was.

“Did Reiya escape?”Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Qin Yu’s heart suddenly tightened as he thought of the arrogant girl he had met in Heavenly Sin.

“As Ming’s daughter, she should be among these ten people. However, no one can get the exact details now, so we can’t be sure.”

“Other than these two places, is there any other information?”

After pondering for a while, Qin Yu asked again.

“Yes, there is. One of them is the battle between the number one kulapati and Mount Mang Ghost King, Cao Li. Everyone, guess what was the outcome of the battle.”

Cang Yunzi laughed lightly and started to keep them in suspense.

“Hurry up and tell!”

Chang Mang could not help but grab his collar.

He was interrupted at a crucial point. Even Qin Yu wanted to give him two slaps.

“Alright, alright. Young man, don’t be anxious. I’ll tell you now. The battle between the two of them ended in a draw. Even if Mount Mang Ghost King, Cao Li, used all his methods, he couldn’t control the number one kulapati. Therefore, this battle was even more surprising. This person has spent most of his life in seclusion in the Nine Nether Cliff of the Dao Mystical Saint Kingdom. He only revealed himself this time because of the Investiture of Gods. I didn’t expect his first battle to be so earth-shattering!”

Cang Yunzi’s words caused Chang Mang and Qin Yu to glance at each other and wipe away the cold sweat on their faces.

This guy was so terrifying. One had to know that they had even escaped from his hands previously.

“However, after being attacked, the number one kulapati has also returned to the Dao Mystical Saint Kingdom. It can only be said that the kingdom is a place of hidden geniuses now. Who knows how many experts have entered? There might even be the true body of the Holy Lord. If one is not careful, one could die at any time.”

Qin Yu’s hair stood on end when he heard that. He knew that the Dao Mystical Saint Kingdom was extremely dangerous, but he didn’t expect it to be this terrifying.

The Alester family entered. The number one kulapati, who was comparable to the Holy Lord, also retreated.

This included the various major factions that had been chasing after the traces of the Investiture of Gods, as well as the strength of the other 17 Holy Lords.

With all these experts added together, he could probably encounter them at any time.

No wonder Cang Yunzi, this cunning old Daoist, didn’t hesitate and directly went into seclusion here.

“With so many experts here, wouldn’t this place be extremely chaotic?”

Aiden frowned.

“You guys have forgotten one thing. This is the Dao Mystical Saint Kingdom, not the Saint World or the other Holy Lords’ territory. Although there is no Holy Lord here, it’s still the Dao Mystical Saint Kingdom. We have lived here for many years and have many advantages.”

Cang Yunzi shook his head.

“Suppress! The power of the Dao Mystical Saint Kingdom suppresses outsiders!”

Qin Yu’s eyes lit up.

“That’s right. These people will be suppressed when they enter this place. Even the Holy Lords are no exception. This is also the reason why they don’t dare to descend to other Saint Kingdoms. It’s just that the Dao Mystical Saint Kingdom doesn’t have a Holy Lord, so we can’t use the power of Saint Kingdom. Otherwise, these people won’t dare to act so recklessly even if they join forces,!”

Cang Yunzi sighed.

“Right now, the various major powers are all maintaining their silence. Perhaps they are searching for information or preparing for something else. However, there are no new movements for the time being. However, according to my information, the Hearts of Saint Kingdom are currently being crazily snatched. Therefore, if you have someone with a Heart of Saint Kingdom, you must be more careful during this period.”

“Why?”

Qin Yu frowned and asked.

“Other than the power of order that the Heart of Saint Kingdom carries, the most important thing is that it carries the core attributes of the Saint Kingdom. Once it’s refined, the rejection force will be greatly reduced.”

Cang Yunzi said seriously.

“The current Dao Mystical Saint Kingdom can only be said to be a bottomless pool of water. I don’t know who’s plotting and who’s a chess piece. In any case, everyone with the Investiture of Gods as the center can’t escape. This storm might only subside when this supreme treasure completely disappears.”

“Chang Mang, your holy body can perfectly merge with the Heart of Saint Kingdom. If we increase our search power, we might have a chance!”

Qin Yu said to Chang Mang.

“I understand. It’s just a battle. I can feel endless power here.”

Chang Mang laughed sinisterly.

If it was outside the Dao Mystical Saint Kingdom, this amount of power might not even be enough.

However, outsiders would be severely suppressed once they entered this place.

Even Ancient Demon Wu Tian who had once shocked the entire Saint World was the same, let alone others.

Chang Mang now had two Boundless Hearts of Saint Kingdom. Altogether, he had a total of eighteen Hearts of Saint Kingdom.

They could already gain a certain advantage here. If they could continue to get more Heart of Saint Kingdom, it would be of great help to them in the future.

The current Qin Yu was practically already unable to make a move.

The last time he used the One Thought Reincarnation, he was immediately detected by the consciousness of the Investiture of Gods.

He didn’t know if that consciousness had marked him. If it had, there would be serious consequences if he had any abnormal movements this time.

Although he had already become a god, as long as he was given a commandment that went deep into his soul, he would be able to do it.

He might not be able to recover for a few years, or even decades or centuries. Therefore, Qin Yu did not dare to use his strength unless he could find a solution.

“Do you know where Ming Alester is?”

Qin Yu suddenly asked.

“The people of this family are very mysterious. Although they have fallen for a long time, the ten carefully selected people with top-notch bloodlines can’t leave such negligence. They must be hiding in the dark. Perhaps they want to solve the mystery of the Investiture of Gods before they come out to deal with these people.”

Cang Yunzi guessed.

Situ Qianxun was able to use the power of the Investiture of Gods to fight against the two Holy Lords.

This was enough to show the power of the Investiture of Gods. If the Alester family could develop the Investiture of Gods to a new level, they might be able to defeat all the cultivators who entered given their family bloodline power.

This was why Ming Alester had to leave with the top ten even if he had to abandon his entire family.

“What a pity!”

Qin Yu sighed inwardly. If he could find out Reiya’s location, they might be able to work together.
