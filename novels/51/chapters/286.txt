Gu Taichu’s expression was also somewhat awkward.

“Mr. Qin, why don’t you go by yourself? I’m not going,” Yao Qing muttered.

Qin Yu looked at Gu Taichu and smiled. “Master Gu, please forgive him.”

Gu Taichu sighed slightly. “For your sake, I’ll spare his life.”

Yao Qing immediately reacted. He looked at Gu Taichu in horror.

“You... You’re Gu Taichu?” Yao Qing gulped.

Gu Taichu ignored him and just waved his hand. “Let’s go.”

The car sped toward the Jiang Bei region.

The Jiang Bei region was extremely large. Chuzhou was the smallest of these provinces. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

And Bin Province and Chuzhou were separated by another province, so the journey was extremely long.

Qin Yu and Yao Qing took turns and drove from day to night. It wasn’t until the next morning that the three of them arrived at Bin Province.

“This is Bin Province.” After entering the border of Bin Province, Qin Yu took a deep breath.

He released his divine sense and sensed more than half of Bin Province.

“I have to say, the spiritual energy of Bin Province far surpasses that of Chuzhou,” Qin Yu said in a deep voice.

Gu Taichu nodded and said, “Because this place is close to the Divine Alchemist Pavilion, the spiritual energy is naturally denser.”

“Divine Alchemist Pavilion?” Qin Yu’s pupils dilated.

He knew this place. Their status was extremely high, and their medical skills could be said to be unparalleled in the world.

Many important figures would go to the Divine Alchemist Pavilion to seek treatment.

The Pavilion Master of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion was even more elusive. It was extremely difficult to meet him.

“If I have the chance, I have to pay a visit to the Divine Alchemist Pavilion,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

The car continued to move forward, and soon, they arrived at the Gu family’s residence.

Gu Taichu’s residence was rather elegant, and the entire house was constructed in an oriental style.

After pushing open the door and entering the house, one would be greeted by a winding path.

On both sides of the path were bamboo forests that had a martial arts flair.

“My residence is in the front.” Gu Taichu pointed at a mansion not far away.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “Master Gu’s residence is really unique. To have such a house in this era is simply a pleasure.”

Gu Taichu didn’t say anything. He put his hands behind his back and took the lead to walk into the mansion.

As a top-notch martial artist of the Jiang Bei region, Gu Taichu naturally had many disciples.

But today, Gu Taichu was a bit puzzled. He hadn’t seen a single disciple.

“How strange,” Gu Taichu frowned and said.

He tried to release his divine sense, but found that there was no one in the entire Gu family.

“Did they all go out?” Gu Taichu frowned.

“What’s wrong?” Qin Yu asked.

Gu Taichu waved his hand, indicating that there was nothing wrong.

“I’ll take you to see the Enlightenment Tea first,” Gu Taichu said.

Qin Yu nodded excitedly. “Okay!”

Thus, Gu Taichu brought Qin Yu to a secret room.

Although it was called a secret room, it was actually just a warehouse, and the key to this warehouse was only owned by two people.

One was Gu Taichu, and the other was Gu Taichu’s eldest disciple, Chi Feng.

Gu Taichu opened the door of the warehouse and walked to a wooden cabinet.

“The Enlightenment Tea is here.” Gu Taichu slowly opened the cabinet.

Qin Yu was extremely excited. He stared at the cabinet to see what the Enlightenment Tea looked like.

However, when the cabinet was opened, there was nothing inside.

“Huh?” Gu Taichu frowned.

He quickly rummaged through the cabinet and searched the entire warehouse, but he still couldn’t find the Enlightenment Tea!

“How could this be?” At this moment, even Gu Taichu was panicking!

“Master Gu, what happened?” Qin Yu frowned.

Gu Taichu didn’t say anything, but his expression was a bit cold.

“Could it be that Chi Feng took it away?” Gu Taichu’s expression became colder and colder.

After saying that, he looked at Qin Yu and cupped his hands. “I’m sorry, I’m afraid the Enlightenment Tea has been taken away by someone. But don’t worry, I’ll find a way to get it back.”

“It was taken away by someone?” Qin Yu frowned slightly.

Gu Taichu didn’t say anything more. He pushed the door open and hurried into the courtyard.

He couldn’t find anyone in the entire courtyard.

Gu Taichu had a bad feeling about this.

At this moment, a voice suddenly came from the ancient well in the courtyard.

“Master, are you back?” The voice came from the bottom of the ancient well.

Gu Taichu hurried to the ancient well. He saw a disciple shivering in the depths of the ancient well!

“What... what’s going on?!”

Gu Taichu’s expression changed greatly. He raised his hand to reach the well. A gentle force brought the disciple up.

The moment the disciple saw Gu Taichu, he couldn’t help but burst into tears.

“What happened?” Gu Taichu asked coldly.

The disciple wiped his tears and sobbed. “It’s Chi Feng!”

“Chi Feng?” Gu Taichu felt that something was amiss.

His disciple continued, “After you left, Chi Feng went crazy and tried to establish his own sect. He even asked us to be his slaves.”

“If we don’t agree, Chi Feng will kill us!”

“His strength has increased by leaps and bounds. Even if we join hands, we can’t defeat him!”

At this point, his disciple’s tears started to flow out.

He knelt on the ground in anguish and said, “Chi Feng flew into a rage. He... killed all of your disciples!”

“What?!” Upon hearing this, Gu Taichu was instantly enraged!

Waves of internal qi instantly erupted, causing the entire bamboo forest to rustle!

“Master, you must kill Chi Feng and avenge them!” His disciple cried out.

Gu Taichu didn’t say anything for a long time. He quickly restrained his internal qi.

In just a few seconds, a trace of sadness flashed across Gu Taichu’s face.

At this moment, Gu Taichu seemed to have aged dozens of years.

“Master Gu, are... are you okay?” Qin Yu frowned.

Gu Taichu waved his hand and said weakly, “I’m fine. I’m fine...”

After saying that, Gu Taichu fell to the ground.

Qin Yu quickly supported him and poured his spiritual energy into Gu Taichu’s body.

“Let’s go back to the room first.” Qin Yu supported Gu Taichu and walked all the way to the bedroom.

Gu Taichu was lying on the bed with an ambivalent expression on his face.

“Qin Yu, I’m really sorry that I couldn’t keep my promise to your father...” Gu Taichu said guiltily.

Qin Yu waved his hand and said, “At this time, there’s no need to say these things.”

Gu Taichu sighed and said in anguish, “Chi Feng is an orphan. I’ve watched him grow up and taught him all my abilities. I didn’t expect... that he would do such a thing.”

After he said that, tears flowed out of Gu Taichu’s eyes.

Looking at Gu Taichu, who was heartbroken, Qin Yu had mixed feelings.

He could understand Gu Taichu.

The feeling of being betrayed wasn’t good.

Especially by the people closest to him.
