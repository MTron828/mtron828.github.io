Chapter 408: A Slap! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Qin Yu didn’t care about status.

Anyone who provoked him would suffer his wrath, regardless of their status.

Qin Yu looked at Taozi and frowned. “Who hit you?”

Taozi looked a bit evasive as she said, “No... no one. I accidentally bumped into something.”

Qin Yu’s face flashed with coldness. With a wave of his hand, the terrifying internal qi removed the suppression on the two of them.

Yao Qing and Taozi, who had regained their mobility, hurriedly stood up from the ground.

“The two of you, come in with me,” Qin Yu said coldly.

Yao Qing pulled Qin Yu’s arm and opened his mouth while saying, “Mr. Qin, you must be careful.”

Qin Yu nodded and then strode into the room.

As soon as he entered, he saw a woman with a noble temperament standing there in high heels.

After seeing Qin Yu, Zhang Yin said indifferently, “You’re Qin Yu?”

Qin Yu didn’t say anything. His eyes were filled with killing intent as he looked coldly at Zhang Yin.

Zhang Yin turned the tables and said indifferently, “Sit.”

Qin Yu didn’t pay attention to her. Instead, he asked, “Were you the one who made the two of them kneel at the door?”

This shocked Zhang Yin slightly.

As the madam of the Yan family, she personally came to visit Qin Yu. It was bad enough that Qin Yu wasn’t afraid, but the focus was on the two nobodies?

Zhang Yin sized up Qin Yu and said indifferently, “You’re really quite different from ordinary people.”

“Answer my question.” Qin Yu was extremely domineering.

His words infuriated Zhang Yin.

She looked coldly at Qin Yu and said, “Do you know who I am?”

“Does it have anything to do with me?” Qin Yu said coldly.

“What right do you have to make the two of them kneel at the door?”

“How dare you speak to Madam like that? How dare you?!” The Inner Strength Grandmaster beside Zhang Yin berated.

Qin Yu glanced at him and immediately slapped him.

This slap shattered the bodyguard’s face bone! His entire internal qi rapidly withered!

Zhang Yin’s expression was extremely ugly, and a strong killing intent flashed through her eyes!

“Ever since I married into the Yan family, no one has dared to cross me! You’ve really shocked me!” Zhang Yin said coldly.

Qin Yu sneered and said, “Is that so? The big surprise is yet to come.”

After saying that, Qin Yu strode over to Zhang Yin.

“Was the injury on Taozi’s face caused by you?” Qin Yu asked with a cold expression.

Hearing that, Zhang Yin couldn’t help but say angrily, “Qin Yu, don’t go too far! So what if I beat two watchdogs up?!”

“Watchdogs?” Qin Yu sneered.

“I’ll let you know the consequences of beating people up now.”

After saying that, Qin Yu raised his palm and slapped Zhang Yin’s face!

A crisp sound echoed in the room.

A clear palm print quickly appeared on Zhang Yin’s face.

“You... You dared to hit me?! Do you... Do you know who I am?!” Zhang Yin’s eyes were filled with disbelief!

As the madam of the Yan family, no one had ever dared to make a move against her!

“I know,” Qin Yu said with a cold smile.

“You’re a dog reared by the rich, a chicken in the upper circles of Jingdu, an animal that uses its power to bully others and commit crimes,” Qin Yu said with a cold smile.

“You... you...” Zhang Yin was so angry at Qin Yu that she couldn’t say a word.

“Oh right, you are also an ugly woman with a vicious heart,” Qin Yu added.

Zhang Yin was driven mad with anger!

She had thought that if she appeared, Qin Yu would be scared out of his wits.

But she never expected that Qin Yu didn’t take her seriously at all and even insulted her!

“Qin Yu, I won’t let you off!” Zhang Yin said through gritted teeth.

Qin Yu sneered. “Alright, I’ll wait for you.”

Zhang Yin had obviously underestimated Qin Yu.

She couldn’t help but recall what Yan Haoran had said.

Qin Yu really didn’t know his place and he was very brazen.

“Qin Yu, I will remember this slap forever. Let’s wait and see!” Zhang Yin gritted her teeth and said.

After saying this, Zhang Yin stomped on her high heels and walked out angrily.

Qin Yu shouted from behind, “Take care. I won’t send you off. Next time you come, don’t bring such trash along.”

Zhang Yin didn’t say a word as she hopped into the car dejectedly.

The moment she got into the car, Zhang Yin immediately roared out in rage, “Qin Yu actually dared to hit me! I want to kill him! I want to kill him!”

“Madam, please... . . Please calm down.” The bodyguard beside her said softly. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“Trash, a bunch of trash!” Zhang Yin roared out in rage.

The bodyguard, not daring to say a single word, sat at the side.

Zhang Yin being slapped in the face wasn’t a small matter.

If word got out, it would probably shock the entire country!

“Drive back to Jingdu.” Zhang Yin said coldly.

“Yes, my lady.” The bodyguard didn’t dare to say another word.

The car drove all the way back to Jingdu.

The moment she reached home, she saw Yan Sihai sitting coldly on the sofa.

“Old Master... . .”

The moment she saw Yan Sihai, Zhang Yin immediately put on an aggrieved expression.

Yan Sihai looked at Zhang Yin coldly and said, “Who told you to go to Chuzhou?”

Zhang Yin opened her mouth and said in a low voice, “I also want to avenge the Yan family and share your burden...”

“Share my burden?” Yan Sihai looked at Zhang Yin coldly.

“Didn’t I tell you not to interfere in the Yan family’s affairs?”

Zhang Yin pretended to be aggrieved. “I saw that you were too tired recently, so my heart ached for you...”

“Hmph!” Yan Sihai snorted coldly.

“Zhang Yin, don’t think that I don’t know your ulterior motives.”

Zhang Yin didn’t dare to speak.

Although Zhang Yin was a woman, her ambition was extremely great.

She was able to marry into the Yan family because of her scheming.

Therefore, Yan Sihai had always been somewhat wary of her.

“Tell me, how did you share my burden?” Yan Sihai changed the topic and said indifferently.

Zhang Yin gritted her teeth and said, “Qin Yu is simply lawless! He doesn’t take the Yan family seriously!”

“Get to the point.” Yan Sihai drank a mouthful of tea and said indifferently.

Zhang Yin touched her face and said with tears, “Qin Yu... Qin Yu actually dared to hit me!”
