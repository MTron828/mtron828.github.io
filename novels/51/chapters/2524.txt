Chapter 2525 Spatial Deduction

“I have no idea either. I don’t have the impression of going to this place in my remaining memories. Perhaps it’s because we’re unwilling to come into contact with this kind of power. That’s all the information I can provide. If there’s nothing else, don’t disturb me anymore.”

Immortal Emperor Yao closed the lid of the coffin after speaking. He seemed to be going back to sleep.

Qin Yu and Yan Ruoxue stared at the Coffin of Nine Lifetimes, speechless, but did not disturb Immortal Emperor Yao further.

He had provided Chang Mang and Flower Granny with information twice consecutively. Qin Yu was afraid the corpse of the Yao family’s Immortal Emperor would turn hostile if he continued squeezing him.

“I must think of a way to see if I can get more information.”

Qin Yu and Yan Ruoxue looked at each other and saw through each other’s thoughts.

With the vision of the Immortal Emperor, the information that could be retained in his memory must be top-notch for them.

It was the last trace of the Immortal Emperor’s soul in the world.

“If I have the chance, I must see if I can find some supreme treasure that can sustain this soul.”

Yan Ruoxue secretly transmitted her voice to Qin Yu.

Qin Yu nodded with a bitter smile. However, for the soul of an Immortal Emperor, there were probably very few supreme treasures that could be effective for this soul. Or rather, it was a big problem whether they could find it.

After coming out of the Sumeru World, Qin Yu told Flower Granny this information.

“This information is a timely rain for me. At least I have a direction now so I won’t feel as lost as before.” A rare look of surprise appeared on Flower Granny’s face.

The Way of Time is something almost no one truly delved into, hence the scarcity of related information. It was tremendously rare to obtain this information this time.

“Flower Granny, Immortal Emperor Yao also has never been to that place before and doesn’t want to get involved with the powers within. Why don’t Ruoxue and I go with you this time? That way, we can take care of each other.”

Flower Granny hesitated for a moment before shaking her head.

“No, Lei Xin and I have already left Human Race Watch. You guys have to take over from now on. If you leave as well, this place will be without a leader. You will have to work hard for Human Race Watch from now on.”

Flower Granny looked apologetic as she continued.

“Moreover, I have a feeling that the comprehension of the Way of Time might involve other methods besides cultivation. It won’t work even if there are more people.”

“Flower Granny, don’t worry. You must pay attention to your safety on this trip!”

Yan Ruoxue looked worried.

“The pressure on you guys won’t be less staying with Human Race Watch. Although the higher-ups of the alien race are injured and slow down for a while, if Human Race Watch plans to go to purgatory, the home ground advantage will be the alien race. You guys must be cautious.”

Flower Granny Hua reminded them. Now that Lei Xin had left, if not for the fact that the backlash of time was too severe, she would still want to stay in Human Race Watch. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

After giving some important instructions, Flower Granny left.

Late at night, Qin Yu and Yan Ruoxue snuggled up in the Sumeru ring.

At this moment, the Sumeru World not only had its own sun, moon, and planets.

Under the moonlight, various flowers bloomed in the space. The colorful flowers emanated a charming fragrance. The butterflies danced among the flowers as if they were dancing with them.

The air was filled with the fragrance of fresh plants, making people feel relaxed and happy.

“This place has changed so much!”

Qin Yu was a little surprised.

At this moment, the Sumeru World in Yan Ruoxue’s hands seemed to have become her own world. There were even some self-rules flowing within it.

Although it was quite shallow, there was a faint semblance of something emerging. It was something that Qin Yu could not do before.

Although there was only a trace of rules, the power that it could blast was at least a tenfold increase compared with previously.

“A world within a world. However, this seems to be the limit. This place will collapse whenever I want to perfect the rules further.”

Yan Ruoxue said somewhat helplessly.

“It’s good enough. I’ve seen the Ni family’s Ni Temple of Heaven and various powerful mystic realms. There are very few places with their own rules. Despite the power of rules in the Ni Temple of Heaven, it’s slightly stronger. I’ve given this Sumeru World to the right person!”

Qin Yu gasped. If the Sumeru World that Qin Yu previously owned could only be described as a space…

The space that Yan Ruoxue had now was the real world.

It had its own way.

If only it were even more perfect and exquisite, even a sixth-level Saint would be defeated by Yan Ruoxue if he were here.

Because this was her real world, and she was the creator.

“This is similar to the power of a domain, but the power of a domain is based on the original Path of Heaven to accomplish. My idea is to defy the heavens and create other spatial rules that belong to me. All other ways will derive from this rule.”

A round black object appeared on Yan Ruxue’s fingertip.

However, one could clearly hear the terrifying sound of a storm tearing apart. That dark power slowly spread out.

It turned into a massive black plane, and then, under Yan Ruoxue’s control, the two sides slowly squeezed together.

Countless folds slowly appeared, and many parts protruded and indented.

This was the environment of the current space. Even the Holy Region they were in was a part of this space.

Qin Yu’s expression suddenly froze.

The lines in the countless spaces continued to grow for several years, tens of thousands of years, hundreds of thousands of years, and millions of years.

He saw an unbelievable scene.

A relatively larger space previously sucked away all the qi in the other spaces at this moment, and in the end, only the large space was left.

After the black plane evolved into billions of small spaces, only one remained.

This manifestation only lasted for two hours but made Qin Yu’s hair stand on end.

Yan Ruoxue’s manifestation was actually similar to his Five Element and Eight Trigram Technique, but she was using the evolution of space to deduce it.

“If we were one of those large spaces, perhaps it would be good for the Holy Region and the human race. If we were just one of those small spaces, it would be a disaster for us no matter where that large space comes from.”

Qin Yu shook his head with a bitter smile. He had already felt it after the Golden Age descended.

The spiritual energy in the air started to become scarce. He thought it was a normal change caused by the great change of the Path of Heaven. However, after seeing Ruoxue’s deduction, Qin Yu could not help but feel a chill run down his spine.

Suddenly, Qin Yu’s expression changed drastically.

“Ruoxue, maintain your current state for now. You can’t continue deducing.”
