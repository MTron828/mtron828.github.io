In mid-air, the huge red sword was still slowly condensing.

The red light blotted out the sky and turned the entire sky red.

Qin Yu’s expression was solemn, his muscles tensed up, and his internal qi was rapidly adjusted to its peak.

Since Han Wei was the young master of an aristocratic family, his strength and power naturally didn’t stop there.

Therefore, this spell didn’t cause Qin Yu to feel too shocked.

“Qin Yu, go to h*ll!” Han Wei’s hands trembled. Then, with a loud roar, that huge sword buzzed towards Qin Yu!

This huge red sword seemed to contain a force of ten thousand tons. Qin Yu felt an extremely strong pressure even though he was far away!

It was as if ten thousand mountains were slowly pressing down on him!

“Rumble!”

Finally, the huge sword smashed down fiercely!

Qin Yu let out an angry roar. His entire body glowed with golden light. He raised both of his fists at the same time and met the attack head-on!

“Clang!”

The huge explosion shook the earth, causing it to rumble. Qin Yu’s body instantly sank down by a few degrees!

The ground under his feet began to shatter. A powerful force slowly spread out and enveloped the entire small mountain!

“Ah!!”

The golden light on Qin Yu’s body grew stronger, and the Divine Dragon Power was unleashed to the extreme!

“It’s useless.” Not far away, Kong Yun shook his head.

“At that time, I also thought that I could forcefully withstand it, but in the end, I was almost defeated.”

Kong Yun’s words received the approval of everyone.

Even Yan Jinyao nodded.

“This technique is Han Xiu’s famous technique. It’s not something an ordinary person can withstand,” Yan Jinyao said nonchalantly.

“If he can withstand this technique, then he might have a chance of winning,” Chu Heng said.

“Crack!”

At this moment, a crisp sound rang out from Qin Yu’s body. It seemed to be the sound of bones being crushed!

However, his figure continued to sink downwards. Even if the qi energy in his body was unleashed to the extreme, it was still unable to block the suppression of this huge sword!

“Good, good! hahaha!” Yan Sihai finally revealed a trace of a smile.

Han Meng also heaved a sigh of relief. If he lost in front of so many people, then the Han family’s reputation would be completely ruined.

Not far away, the Pavilion Master’s expression was somewhat solemn. Her body was flickering with light, as if she had the intention to make a move.

“Ah!!”

Right at this moment, Qin Yu suddenly roared!

The golden light began to converge, and then it spread at an extremely fast speed!

In an instant, Qin Yu was bathed in the golden light and his body expanded!

“Cosmic form!” Seeing this technique, Xia Hang stood up abruptly with a trace of fear in his eyes!

“Cosmic form!”

Other than Xia Hang, there were also other people who recognized this technique!

There were many top powerhouses who had been in seclusion for many years among the guests present today. They seemed to be quite shocked by the cosmic form!

“It’s actually the cosmic form.” Yan Jinyao frowned, and a trace of killing intent flashed in his eyes.

“Brother Yan, what is the cosmic form? Is it very powerful?” Zhuang Teng asked.

Yan Jinyao glanced at him and nodded. “I’ve seen records in the ancient books of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association. It’s said that a person once used this technique to kill several Martial Saints.”

“Martial Saints?!” For a moment, everyone gasped!

One person killed several Martial Saints? What kind of unimaginable strength was that?

One had to know that in today’s world, not to mention Martial Saints, but even Martial Marquises were extremely rare!

Yan Jinyao continued, “There’s a saying. It’s said that the reason why there are so few Martial Saints now is that that person killed more than half of the remaining Martial Saints.”

“Brother Yan, you must be joking. How could there be such a person in this world?” Zhuang Teng shook his head.

“Yes, Brother Yan. It’s not that we don’t want to believe it, but this sounds too fake.” The others nodded as well.

Even Yan Jinyao said, “Yes, I also think it’s fake.”

“Boom!”

Under the effect of the cosmic form, Qin Yu’s body expanded explosively. His strength also erupted at this moment!

“Ah!!”

Qin Yu roared repeatedly, and the strength of his entire body was exerted to the max.

For a moment, the huge sword actually started to retreat!

“Impossible!” Han Wei’s expression changed!

He gritted his teeth and immediately raised his large hand, and a red light fell into the huge red sword.

“Kacha!”

In an instant, the huge sword pressed down once again! Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“What bullsh * t technique... Watch me crush it with one punch!”

Qin Yu dragged the huge sword with one hand, while a dazzling golden light surrounded his other hand!

This golden light was pure to the extreme, and for a moment, it actually turned into a blazing white color!

Qin Yu’s huge fist smashed towards the huge sword fiercely!

“Rumble!”

The huge collision instantly shattered the distant mountain range!

If it wasn’t for the presence of Martial Marquis, the venue would have been reduced to ruins long ago!

“Crack!”

Under this punch, the huge sword began to shatter!

Numerous cracks quickly spread out, and the blood-red light slowly dimmed.

“Boom!”

Finally, under Qin Yu’s punch, the huge red sword exploded in mid-air!

“How is this possible?!” Kong Yun’s expression instantly changed!

He was someone who had personally experienced this technique, so he knew the power of this technique!

Back then, even after Kong Yun revealed all his trump cards, he was still unable to counter this technique.

But now, this technique had been destroyed by Qin Yu’s punch! How could he believe this?!

Not far away, Han Wei’s expression was also somewhat unsightly. He stared fixedly at Qin Yu, and his fists were tightly clenched.

At this moment, he suddenly realized that he had underestimated Qin Yu!

Afraid that they would miss anything during this exciting scene, everyone stared at this scene without daring to blink.

The golden light on Qin Yu’s body began to slowly disappear, and his body returned to its normal size.

A layer of sweat appeared on his forehead, and more than half of the internal qi in his body had been consumed.

‘The cosmic form is still too stressful for me,’ Qin Yu thought to himself.

Then, he looked coldly at Han Wei and said in a low voice, “I have to find a way to recover my spiritual power.”

Thinking of this, Qin Yu’s feet shook, and his body was once again wrapped in golden light.

This technique was the third level of the Saintly Body Technique. At this moment, the Saintly Body Technique’s consumption of spiritual power could be ignored, but his physical body’s strength could be exerted to the extreme.

He looked coldly at Han Wei, who wasn’t far away, and in the next second, his figure suddenly disappeared!

“Shrinking Ground Into An Inch!”

Qin Yu spat out a few words coldly and arrived in front of Han Wei at an extremely fast speed!

“Bang!”

Qin Yu’s fierce fist smashed onto Han Wei’s chest with a crushing force.

Han Wei instantly retreated a few steps. Before he could catch his breath, Qin Yu took another step forward!

Han Wei’s body was sent flying, and his body was covered in bloody wounds!

“Boom!”

Just as Qin Yu swung his third punch, an intense force erupted from Han Wei’s body.

This force forced Qin Yu back a few steps!

When he raised his head, he saw that Han Wei’s body seemed to be covered in a layer of armor!

With a ferocious expression, Han Wei gnashed his teeth and said, “Don’t think that you are the only one who can fight. Let me tell you, everything that you are proud of isn’t worth mentioning!”
