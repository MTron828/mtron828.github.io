2232 Wang Feng Is Missing

“Qin Yu, my friend, let me remind you that Si Liuhe and Si Shiyu of the Si family, and the saintess and Holy Son of the Yan family have the chance to attempt the Tribulation Transcending Stage of the Path of Heaven, especially the combination of the chaotic body and the Heavenly Emperor bloodline. With the resources of the aristocratic families of the Holy Region, their progress would probably be tremendously fast after they broke through to the True Sainst Realm with the resources of the aristocratic families of the Holy Region.”

The man with the mustache glanced at Qin Yu.

“I definitely won’t let Ruoxue marry someone she doesn’t like!”

Qin Yu clenched his fists tightly.

“It’s hard for you to understand what Tribulation Transcending Stage cultivator means. The head of the Yan family will agree to this marriage without hesitation, even if there’s only a trace of a chance. It’s indeed rare enough to give you a hundred years.”

The man with the mustache shook his head.

Qin Yu was a bit annoyed and restless. He suddenly felt a little lost at this moment. He had been working hard, but it was never enough.

“Why?”

He was screaming frantically deep down.

Not long after, they arrived at the valley, the place where Wang Feng had brought Qin Yu previously.

“Hmm?”

Qin Yu sensed that something was wrong.

A great battle seemed to have taken place here. The entire valley was full of potholes, and dust floated in the air.

Qin Yu’s divine sense swept found, and Wang Feng was nowhere to be seen.

“D*mn, the Celestial Star Formation, and the Six Ghosts Formation, two formations combined! This guy is quite interesting.”

The man with the mustache’s eyes widened.

“Brat, you also gave him the information that you gave me? Didn’t you say that you would only give it to me?” The man with the mustache man suddenly reacted.

“He’s a rare formation genius. Let him comprehend it.”

Qin Yu smiled awkwardly.

“Looking at how he set up the formation, it indeed isn’t a waste giving it to him. Look at the aftermath, it must be someone at least at the True Saint Realm that had attacked. He even had a peak Saint Weapon to break the formation. Wang Feng must have been taken away by someone.” The man with the mustache shook his head again.

Qin Yu’s divine sense locked onto a person. He lightly stepped into the air and directly arrived before him. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Who is it?”

A black-robed cultivator with a fierce and intense expression shouted. A flying knife silently tore through the air from beneath the black robe.

Qin Yu flicked the dagger away with a finger, then came before the cultivator with a fierce and intense expression, lifting his neck.

“Where’s Wang Feng?”

“Brat, I’m a disciple of the Blood Sect. I can spare your life if you let me go now!”

The cultivator, with a fierce and intense expression, said a few words with difficulty.

“The Blood Sect again.”

Qin Yu’s expression turned cold.

“Die!”

Qin Yu snapped the cultivator’s head and activated the Soul Torment Mind Technique.

A black hand suddenly grabbed his divine sense coming out of his sea of consciousness.

“Spare me, spare me! Wang Feng has been brought by our elder to the sect. He said he wanted to make him our blood slave and serve our sect!”

The fierce and intense looked cultivator’s divine sense was terrified, staring at the giant black hand in shock.

“I don’t need you anymore!”

Qin Yu was furious. He had long treated Wang Feng as a friend and did not expect him to fall victim to a deadly attack.

The black hand suddenly grabbed the cultivator’s divine sense and put it into his mouth to chew.

In an instant, a sea of memories suddenly entered Qin Yu’s mind.

“Formation Masters are tremendously rare. If a sect can have an additional Formation Master to join in, its strength will greatly increase. Moreover, it will also play a vital role in exploring the Mystic Realm.”

The man with the mustache said by the side.

“This Blood Sect is one of the four largest sects in this galaxy. The sect master and elders of the Blood Sect are controlling many of their disciples to be their lapdogs through spiritual soul restrictions.”

Qin Yu said with a frown.

No wonder some people besides the Blood Sect’s young lord, Zong Yue, had their bodies bent and looked like slaves.

“How strong is their sect? If it’s not that strong, we can go over and snatch Wang Feng back,” the man with the mustache said.

Qin Yu searched the fierce and intense looked cultivator’s memories. Suddenly, a parasite appeared in the cultivator’s spiritual soul.

That parasite had three eyes, and its round mouth was densely packed with sawteeth.

That parasite broke through Qin Yu’s palm and suddenly bit Qin Yu’s head.

“Three Corpse Parasite, watch out!”

The man with the mustache shouted.

“A wisp of divine sense dares to court death!”

Qin Yu shouted coldly. The black palm suddenly clenched in his hand again. And with great force, he turned the Three Corpse Parasite into powder. A pure power of spiritual soul directly fused into Qin Yu’s divine sense figurine.

“The Three Corpse Parasite is a tremendously powerful soul restriction. It turns one’s divine sense into a mother parasite and then continuously splits into child worms. Once these worms parasitize a cultivator’s soul, they won’t stop until the cultivator dies. This Blood Sect’s sect master is most probably an extremely powerful soul-cultivating cultivator. We have to be careful.”

The man with the mustache frowned.

At this moment, two blood-red pupils suddenly opened in the depths of purgatory. They looked thoughtfully in the direction of the Black Platform Continent.

“It’s hard to say. When I forcefully scanned his divine sense, the latter part of his consciousness was suddenly erased by the restriction! It’s a tremendously powerful restriction.”

Qin Yu shook his head. “But it’s so strange. Their sect seems to be established somewhere in purgatory. This purgatory is a place where demonic beasts ran amok. It isn’t realistic to establish a sect there, right?”

“It’s hard to say. It might be similar to a Mystic Realm. The Blood Sect has a mighty realm cultivator who opened up a void space and moved the disciples inside. It’s equivalent to your Sumeru Ring.”

The man with the mustache analyzed and said.

….

The two returned to Solitary Cloud City.

“What do you plan to do now?” The man with the mustache asked.

“I want to go to the seventh level of purgatory to obtain the bone cultivation water,” Qin Yu frowned and said.

“It’s too dangerous. The seventh level of purgatory usually requires a team to travel. It’s too difficult to travel alone.”

The man with the mustache shook his head.

Qin Yu frowned. His idea was to gather some bone cultivation water at the edge to increase the amount slowly.

“Take me to the Sumeru Space. I’ve been arranging something recently. I’ll have good news to tell you if I’m lucky.”

The man with the mustache said mysteriously.

After Qin Yu pulled the man with the mustache into the Sumeru Space, he suddenly had an idea.

“Elder Guai, can we store bone cultivation water in this space?”

“Of course, you can, but you have to control your divine sense well and use the spatial internal qi of the ring to wrap the water of Bone Cultivation River before you can transfer it in.”

Elder Gual nodded.

“In other words, as long as I have enough time, I can lead the water of Bone Cultivation River into the ring.”

Qin Yu nodded thoughtfully. Suddenly, an idea popped into his head.

He could hold off those demon beasts for a while if he could find a reliable teammate. He could then fetch some water!

“Don’t look at me. I don’t participate in these fighting and killing matters. You look for the person yourself.”

The man with the mustache stared at Qin Yu warily.

Qin Yu felt a headache. It was too dangerous to form a team here.

At a critical moment, he might suddenly be backstabbed. Qin Yu dared not casually form a team now.

When Qin Yu was lost in wandering thoughts, suddenly a tremendous pain struck his head, and an intense craving for souls surged into his mind like never before.
