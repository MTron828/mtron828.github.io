Chapter 473: Fnally Found! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

“No one is allowed to touch the Three Pure Ancient Tree!” That fierce shout sounded again, and it launched an even more ferocious attack toward Qin Yu!

Qin Yu dodged while thinking of countermeasures.

However, at this time, the strength of the Guardian had greatly increased, and it was even close to the half-step Martial Marquis Realm!

Qin Yu was multitasking, and in the end, the Guardian seized the opportunity.

“Clang!”

A fierce steel blade forcefully struck Qin Yu’s shoulder.

A bloody scar instantly appeared on his shoulder, and even his bones were slightly damaged.

“This won’t do. If this continues, I won’t have a chance to take the Three Pure Ancient Tree.” Qin Yu’s expression was somewhat unsightly.

He had never expected that this Guardian would be so difficult to deal with.

“It won’t work if I try to snatch it by force. I can only think of a way to outsmart him.” Qin Yu retreated at high speed.

He released his divine sense in an attempt to find a weak spot on this Guardian’s body.

Unfortunately, this Guardian was only a spirit body, so he couldn’t find any weak spot at all.

“Bang!”

Another steel blade brushed past Qin Yu’s forehead and struck the huge rock on his body.

The huge rock shattered.

Qin Yu took a few steps back and couldn’t help but wipe the sweat off his forehead.

“Buzz!”

The Guardian was once again approaching at a speed several times faster!

Qin Yu had nowhere to hide and could only clench his fist to meet the attack!

“Boom!”

Qin Yu clenched his golden fist and smashed it onto the head of the Guardian.

This time, the Guardian wasn’t blasted apart, but only took a few steps back.

“Oh no.” Seeing this situation, Qin Yu felt even more uneasy.

If he were to be killed again, Qin Yu wouldn’t be a match for the reborn Guardian!

“Leave quickly!” The Guardian seemed to have been angered by Qin Yu. He held the steel knife in his hand and slashed at him in a disorderly manner.

Qin Yu didn’t dare to kill him, nor did he dare to fight head-on. He could only dodge.

The surrounding environment was smashed into smithereens. It was extremely chaotic.

The Guardian still didn’t have any intention of stopping. He wouldn’t stop until Qin Yu was forced to retreat.

“Huh?”

At this moment, Qin Yu’s eyes lit up!

He was surprised to find that the surrounding environment seemed to be somewhat strange!

“That huge rock was clearly smashed just now, but now, it’s actually intact?” Qin Yu stared at that huge rock and his eyes were filled with astonishment!

He quickly scanned his surroundings.

As expected, the environment that was messed up by the Guardian was slowly recovering!

“I understand!” Seeing this scene, Qin Yu suddenly understood!

In this environment, not only could the Guardian be reborn, but everything in the environment would be reborn.

And the Guardian, like the huge rock, was just a part of this environment!

“I understand.” Qin Yu leaped into the air.

“I took the wrong path and mistakenly thought that the problem was with the Guardian,” Qin Yu said in a deep voice.

In reality, the real problem was the environment!

In other words, a formation had been set up here. As long as the formation wasn’t broken, everything inside could be reborn indefinitely!

“Any formation has a core. As long as the core is broken, the Guardian will naturally disappear.” A relieved smile appeared on Qin Yu’s face.

“Leave quickly!” The Guardian once again closed in on Qin Yu!

Qin Yu dodged continuously.

At the same time, he released his divine sense while covering the entire environment in an attempt to find the core of the formation.

“Clang!”

Under such circumstances, Qin Yu’s speed suddenly decreased by a lot. The Guardian slashed at Qin Yu’s chest again.

Qin Yu didn’t care about it. He focused all his attention on finding the core of the formation.

“Could it be that crystal?” Qin Yu frowned and looked at the crystal that was flickering not far away.

He didn’t dare to confirm it, so he could only hold the golden light in his hand and throw a punch.

The crystal shattered, but the Guardian showed no signs of disappearing.

“It isn’t.” Qin Yu frowned.

The formation core couldn’t be so eye-catching.

“Or is it that piece of gravel?”

Qin Yu was like a headless fly as he constantly shattered the surrounding environment.

After an entire hour, Qin Yu was already panting from exhaustion, but he didn’t find the formation core at all. Instead, he angered the Guardian.

“Strange.” Qin Yu wiped the sweat off his forehead as he fled.

His expression was somewhat unsightly. Everything in the surroundings, big and small, had been shattered into pieces, yet he was still unable to find the location of the core of the formation.

“Where is the core of the formation...” Qin Yu muttered in a low voice. His face couldn’t help but reveal some anxiety.

If this continued, he was afraid that he would really die here!

“Buzz!”

The Guardian’s steel blade ruthlessly struck Qin Yu’s head.

Qin Yu instantly felt as if his head had been struck by a heavy blow, and he almost fell to the ground.

“D*mn it!”

This completely infuriated Qin Yu. He clenched his golden fist and suddenly smashed it towards the Guardian!

With this punch, the Guardian finally fell down and slowly disappeared from this environment.

However, in less than half a second, the Guardian appeared again!

And this time, the strength of the Guardian had reached an unbelievable stage!

“Half-step Martial Marquis!” F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Feeling the internal qi of the Guardian, Qin Yu’s expression was extremely ugly!

With his current state, it wasn’t so easy to defeat a half-step Martial Marquis!

“Leave quickly!” The Guardian roared.

Qin Yu didn’t dare to be negligent and looked at the Guardian in front of him with a grave expression.

At this moment, Qin Yu suddenly seemed to have thought of something.

His eyes lit up and he raised his head to look at the towering Water Rhyme Tower!

“Could it be... that the Water Rhyme Tower is the core of this formation?!” Qin Yu exclaimed.

Other than this, Qin Yu couldn’t think of any other possibilities!

As the saying went, the most dangerous place was the safest place. This array’s core could very well be this Water Rhyme Tower!

“Whatever, I can only fight to the death.” Qin Yu took a deep breath and muttered in a low voice.

Thinking of this, he hurriedly leaped up.

With a leap, Qin Yu arrived on top of the Water Rhyme Tower.

Then, he put away the Venerable Fifth Mountain and walked out of the door.

Outside the door, Elder Qu was looking at Qin Yu with eager eyes.

After seeing Qin Yu leave, Elder Qu smiled and said, “Qin Yu, how is it? Is it over?”

Qin Yu didn’t say anything.

Elder Qu definitely wouldn’t agree to let him destroy the Water Rhyme Tower.

This act could no longer be continued. Naturally, there was no point in trying to curry favor with Elder Qu.

Qin Yu’s feet shook, and his body rose into the air.

He stared at the Water Rhyme Tower and his entire body was surging with energy.

Golden light lingered in the air, as if a sun had appeared.

And the golden light in his fist emitted an intense deterrent force!

Seeing this scene, Elder Qu immediately felt that things weren’t looking good.

He said somewhat nervously, “Qin Yu, what... what do you want to do?”

Qin Yu ignored him and whispered, “I can only give it a try.”

Before he could finish his words, Qin Yu’s fist came crashing down on the Water Rhyme Tower!

“Boom!”

In an instant, the entire Water Rhyme Tower was on the verge of collapsing, and countless pieces of gravel fell down!

“Qin Yu, what are you trying to do?!” Elder Qu was instantly anxious. His palm was surrounded by light, and he had the intention to attack.

Qin Yu couldn’t care less about Elder Qu. He could only use all his strength to smash at the Water Rhyme Tower again!

Boom!

Under this punch, the Water Rhyme Tower finally couldn’t take it anymore and began to collapse!
