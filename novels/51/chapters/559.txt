Chapter 560: The Stubborn Yan Jiang! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Gu Canghai’s internal qi burst forth, and each of his moves was aimed at Yan Jiang’s vital points!

Faced with Gu Canghai’s strength, Yan Jiang had no way to retreat. He could only face the attack head-on.

Lights continued to shine, and the entire Beaufort Tower seemed to have been turned into ruins. The scene was extremely chaotic.

This was a battle between Martial Marquises. No one dared to move forward. Everyone retreated because they were afraid that they would be implicated.

At this moment, Qin Yu was desperately fusing the two streams of internal qi.

“I have to hurry...” Qin Yu gritted his teeth and used all his divine sense to fuse the two internal qi.

In the blink of an eye, twenty minutes had passed. Qin Yu’s internal qi seemed to have reached the critical point!

“No... At this speed, I won’t be able to make it in time.” Qin Yu’s expression was extremely ugly.

At this moment, Zhen Yue ran over from not far away.

“Mr. Qin, I. . . I’ll save you,” Zhen Yue said anxiously.

After saying that, she started to pull out the light beams that were inserted into Qin Yu’s vital points.

Unfortunately, with Zhen Yue’s strength, she couldn’t move these ten light beams at all.

Even if she tried her best, she couldn’t move them at all!

“What... What should I do?” Zhen Yue was so anxious that her face flushed and she was at a loss.

Qin Yu didn’t pay attention to her. He didn’t dare to be distracted because he was pressed for time.

Swoosh!

At this moment, Gu Canghai’s sharp fingers tore at Yan Jiang’s chest like steel claws!

His chest was instantly torn. The three bloody marks were so deep that crystal white bones were even exposed!

“Yan Jiang, you;re no match for me. Die!” Gu Canghai shouted.

Black gas condensed on Gu Canghai’s hands. At a glance, it was as if his hands had come from the depths of h*ll!

This technique was Gu Canghai’s famous consummate skill, called the Deadly Ghost Hand!

It was said that this technique couldn’t only harm the physical body, but it could even cause a spiritual impact!

Yan Jiang opened his mouth slightly, and a light seal shot out!

This technique came from the Jingdu Martial Arts Association, and it was called the Rainbow Divine Seal!

This divine seal ruthlessly smashed toward Gu Canghai’s Deadly Ghost Hand!

“Boom!”

The two techniques collided, and a boiling wave of air, like a sea of fire, spread out in all directions!

From the power of this technique, Gu Canghai immediately took a few steps back.

His expression was gloomy, and he said coldly, “You actually know the Rainbow Divine Seal. Old Mister Yan really had high hopes for you.”

Yan Jiang didn’t say a word as he panted.

His internal qi started to become unstable. It seemed that he couldn’t maintain his Martial Marquis Realm anymore.

“Yan Jiang, I’ll ask you one last time. Do you really want to betray the Yan family?” Gu Canghai coldly said.

Yan Jiang wiped the blood at the corner of his mouth and coldly replied, “If Old Mister Yan were alive, he definitely wouldn’t treat Miss Yan like Yan Sihai does.”

“So, the one who betrayed the Yan family is you guys. I have never betrayed anyone,” Yan Jiang said coldly.

Gu Canghai laughed and said, “Yan Jiang, you’re really a loyal dog! Old Mister Yan has long become a thing of the past. Now, the Yan family is under the control of Yan Sihai!”

“This is the difference between you and me,” Yan Jiang said while gritting his teeth.

Obviously, Gu Canghai was deliberately stalling for time.

Yan Jiang could only maintain the Martial Marquis Realm for half an hour. As long as he could stall for half an hour, then Yan Jiang wouldn’t be worth mentioning.

“Sect Master Gu, Qin Yu seems to be trying to break through to the Martial Marquis Realm!” At this moment, someone suddenly shouted!

Hearing this, Gu Canghai immediately looked in the direction of Qin Yu!

Sure enough, at this moment, Qin Yu’s internal qi was condensed, and all the acupoints were shining!

Gu Canghai’s expression turned cold, and he shouted, “Brat, don’t even think about stepping into the Martial Marquis Realm!”

After saying that, Gu Canghai quickly walked towards Qin Yu!

However, a figure blocked Gu Canghai’s path!

“Unless I die, don’t even think about getting close to Qin Yu,” Yan Jiang said coldly.

Gu Canghai was furious, “You’re courting death!”

After saying that, Gu Canghai used the same trick again. His huge palm fiercely smashed towards Yan Jiang!

Yan Jiang naturally didn’t dare to be negligent. He clenched his fist and went up to meet it.

But this time, the collision caused Yan Jiang to retreat dozens of steps!

It was because Yan Jiang’s Martial Marquis Realm was rapidly disappearing!

“Hahaha!” Seeing this scene, Gu Canghai immediately burst into laughter!

“Your internal qi is about to disappear. I’d like to see how you can stop me!”

Gu Canghai’s internal qi burst forth and charged towards Yan Jiang once again!

Another palm strike landed on Yan Jiang’s chest. This palm strike almost shattered Yan Jiang’s body!

In an instant, Yan Jiang’s entire body was covered in blood. It was a tragic sight!

But even so, Yan Jiang stood up once again!

He stood in front of Gu Canghai with great difficulty, gritted his teeth, and said, “Don’t even think about getting half a step closer!”

“You’re courting death!” Gu Canghai didn’t say a word, and struck at Yan Jiang with his palm.

“Boom!”

A loud sound came from Yan Jiang’s body. There was no telling how many parts of his bones had been broken!

He lay on the ground and wanted to stand up, but he found that the internal qi in his entire body was beginning to weaken!

“Oh no.” Yan Jiang’s expression was a little ugly.

After using a secret technique to step into the Martial Marquis Realm, he would fall into a coma! At that time, not to mention stopping Gu Canghai, it would be impossible for him to even stay awake!

Yan Jiang gritted his teeth and tried his best to get up, but he failed every time! Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

At this moment, Gu Canghai was already walking towards Qin Yu!

Yan Jiang’s expression was extremely ugly. He couldn’t help but think of the first time he met Qin Yu!

Back then, Qin Yu was also defeated countless times!

Every time Yan Jiang thought he couldn’t get up anymore, he would stand up!

It was because of his strong will and fighting spirit!

“Ah!!” Yan Jiang roared with all his strength. He slowly got up and shot toward Gu Canghai!

Yan Jiang curled his hands and grabbed Gu Canghai’s waist from behind!

Gu Canghai’s expression turned cold as he said sinisterly, “You’re really courting death!”

He held a huge force in his hands and ruthlessly smashed towards Yan Jiang’s back!

“Crack!”

Under this huge force, Yan Jiang’s back was on the verge of being shattered!

But even so, Yan Jiang still didn’t show any signs of letting go!

His entire body was already covered in blood, but his unyielding will allowed him to hug Gu Canghai tightly!

Gu Canghai was thoroughly enraged. A light that was like a sharp blade lingered on his palm as he said coldly, “You’re courting death! Courting death!”

“Crack!”

As he spoke, the light from Gu Canghai’s palm ruthlessly pierced into Yan Jiang’s back!

“Phew!”

Yan Jiang’s face instantly turned extremely pale, and his internal qi began to rapidly dissipate!

However, what Gu Canghai didn’t expect was that Yan Jiang’s hand was still tightly holding onto Gu Canghai!

Gu Canghai was instantly flustered and exasperated. He looked at the person beside him and shouted, “Kill Qin Yu. No matter what, don’t let him step into the Martial Marquis Realm!”
