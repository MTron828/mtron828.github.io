Chapter 1145: Chapter One thousand one hundred and forty-five, level five of the line formula 

After being reminded by Chu he dao, Qin Yu couldn’t help but start to think about this problem.

Once he left for the Holy Region, he didn’t know when he would be able to return. Before he left, he had to take care of the things that needed to be taken care of.

During this period of time, Qin Yu had accumulated too many things.

Although many things couldn’t be considered important, after all, he had promised others, but he hadn’t fulfilled them yet.

“Sigh.”Thinking of this, Qin Yu couldn’t help but blame himself.

But he had no choice. For the past few years, he didn’t have any time to rest. There was always something pushing him forward.

“Can you beat the Sky Blood Rainbow?”Qin Yu looked at Chu Hedao and asked.

Chu hedao smiled and said, “I don’t know either. Something like that.”

Qin Yu touched his chin and said, “According to what you said, that inheritor is very likely to attack us?”

“That’s right. We are also his main target,”Chu Hedao said.

“I understand.”Qin Yu nodded.

Qin Yu wasn’t too worried about his own safety, but he was a little worried about Chang Mang.

Chang Mang was just like his name. He did things too rashly. One sentence wasn’t pleasing to the ear, and he could make a move at any time.

Although this kind of person was suitable for making friends, he was too easily provoked and fell into a trap.

“By the way, isn’t the last sect leader of the Slaughter Immortal Sect Powerful?”At this moment, Qin Yu suddenly thought of a question.

Chu Hedao smiled, he said, “The last sect leader is the most powerful sect leader in the history of the Slaughter Immortal sect. He is stronger than anyone else. At the same time, he has also absorbed more resources. It is not an exaggeration to say that he has gathered all of his bloodline and special constitution.” Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

When he heard this, a hint of shock flashed across Qin Yu’s face.

Qin Yu had personally witnessed the scene of the last cult master before he died!

He was practically unable to retaliate in front of the masked woman.

Chu Hedao seemed to have noticed Qin Yu’s confusion and smiled, “In that life, it was also a golden great era. It’s not because the last cult master wasn’t strong enough. If there’s anything to blame, it’s because there were too many monsters in that life.”

At this point, Chu Hedao stood up from the rock. He yawned and said, “It’s getting late. It’s time for me to go back and rest.”

Qin Yu nodded and didn’t ask any more questions.

After Chu Hedao left, Qin Yu couldn’t help but fall into deep thought.

According to Chu Hedao, that cult master was enough to suppress every cult master of the Massacre Immortal sect.

And every cult leader of the Massacre Immortal sect was one of the most powerful people in the world.

However, such an existence was still mercilessly crushed by others in the golden great world.

Then, how many monsters would appear in the Golden Great World this time?

“How terrifying.”Qin Yu couldn’t help but shake his head.

He didn’t continue to think about it. Just as Chu Huidao said, his future self had nothing to do with his current self. Taking every step well was what he should do now.

He closed his eyes and the recitation of the ‘Dou’formula appeared in his mind.

This recitation was the technique that Jiang he had taught him, and all the profoundness of the ‘Dou’formula was contained in this recitation.

Top-notch techniques often relied on talent and the ability to comprehend.

For example, Jiang he had spent a very short time to comprehend the ‘Dou’formula to an extremely terrifying realm.

Just a single line of words could contain endless mysteries.

Qin Yu could clearly sense that his cultivation had most likely reached a bottleneck.

It wasn’t that his state of mind had stagnated, but rather that he was in dire need of resources.

Given Qin Yu’s current state, if he wanted to step into the late-stage of the martial saint realm, he would probably need tens or even hundreds of times the resources of others!

This would definitely be an astronomical figure. He would probably need to absorb the resources of the entire Earth in order to have any hope.

“I hope the saint-level has enough resources,”Qin Yu thought to himself.

He closed his eyes and continued to study the battle-character manual.

Right now, Qin Yu’s understanding of the battle-character manual was only at the third level. Every level of improvement would result in an enormous increase in power.

If he could study the battle-character manual to an extremely powerful level, it wouldn’t be much different from breaking through.

The next morning.

Jiang he went out as usual, breathing exercise.

He walked all the way to the top of the mountain and found that Qin Yu had been waiting for him there for a long time.

At this time, Jiang he had changed into a white vest, looking very much like an old man who practiced Taiji fist.

“Senior Jiang He.”Qin Yu cupped his hands to Jiang he.

Jiang he said with slight surprise, “Why are you here?”

“I specially waited for you here,”Qin Yu said with a smile.

Jiang he guessed that Qin Yu must have something to do, so he said with a smile, “Shall we talk while we walk?”

“Okay,”Qin Yu agreed.

The two of them walked on the peak of the mountain. Their speed was very slow, and there was not much difference between them and ordinary people walking.

“Sometimes, taking a walk to calm your mind is also a kind of cultivation. If you blindly pursue the ultimate realm, it is very likely that the opposite will happen,”Jiang he said.

Qin Yu knew that he was being pointed at, so he nodded and said, “Senior, you are right.”

“Tell me, what do you want to talk to me about?”Jiang he was the first to get to the main topic.

Qin Yu said in a deep voice, “I want to know, how far have you comprehended the fighting character formula?”

Jiang he was silent for a moment, then said, “Level five.”

“Level five?”Qin Yu was extremely surprised.

The two of them were only two realms apart, but the effect of the increase was beyond imagination!

Jiang he nodded and said, “That’s right. Level five of the battle word technique can increase my combat power by dozens of times.”

Qin Yu couldn’t help but gasp.

If he increased his combat power by dozens of times, then it wasn’t impossible for him to win against those eight mighty figures.

“Of course, everyone’s constitution is different.”At this moment, Jiang he suddenly said.

“Your improvement might be even greater than mine.”

Qin Yu said with some puzzlement, “Could it be that the improvement brought by the DOU character manual is not fixed?”

“Yes, the multiple is fixed, but the combat strength is different,”Jiang he said.

“Let me give you an example. A hundred times of ten is only a thousand times, but what about a hundred times of a hundred times? That’s ten thousand.”

“It’s the same in terms of strength. One only increased by nine hundred, while the other increased by nine thousand.”
