1951 The Time Was Up

In that case, it would save him a lot of trouble. At least he didn’t have to worry about the third princess.

“You should release them. I don’t like this,” Qin Yu said tentatively.

The third princess hesitated for a while, then waved her hand and said, “Let them go!”

The cultivators who were kneeling on the ground got up quickly. They looked at the third princess and bowed. “Thank you, Third Princess. Thank you, Third Princess…”

!!

“Don’t thank me, thank Brother,” the third princess said.

The group of people quickly looked at Qin Yu and said, “Thank you, Senior. Thank you, Senior…”

After doing this, the third princess looked at Qin Yu with anticipation. Her eyes were shining brightly, and her face was full of excitement.

“I’m going to cultivate here. You go back to your palace first,” Qin Yu said.

“Ah? Cultivate here? This is Xihuang Island, and spiritual energy is thin. Why don’t I pick a place for you? It can be any place in the Yan family,” the third princess said, patting her chest.

Qin Yu couldn’t explain to the third princess. He frowned and said, “No need. I like this place. Please don’t disturb me for the time being, Third Princess.”

Although the third princess was somewhat reluctant, she agreed obediently and said, “Alright. Then you… come to look for me when you’re done.”

“Alright,” Qin Yu agreed and said, but sneered in his heart.

“To look for you? When I’m done with my cultivation, I’ll run away. Who’s going to see you?” Qin Yu thought to himself.

The third princess left Xihuang Island with a group of people. After they left, the cultivators just now quickly walked to Qin Yu.

These people all had one thing in common, which was they looked average. Obviously, the third princess was obsessed with looks.

“Thank you very much, Senior,” the cultivators bowed to Qin Yu and said.

Qin Yu frowned, puzzled, and said, “I’m not quite sure why the third princess is so polite to me.”

“It’s not polite. The third princess likes good-looking men,” a cultivator sighed and said.

“That’s right. Rumor has it that the third princess is infatuated with Yao Xi and does everything he says. The Yan family even tried to matchmake them but was declined by Yao Xi”.

Qin Yu suddenly understood.

It was just as he had thought. The third princess purely had some psychological problems.

“With Senior’s look, you will have a good life on Xihuang Island,” a cultivator sighed and said.

Qin Yu remained silent and did not answer.

Subsequently, they exchanged a few more words. Seeing Qin Yu not keen to answer, they stopped bothering him and walked toward the borders of Xihuang Island.

Qin Yu didn’t dare to waste time. After all, this face could only last for a month.

Furthermore, if the other members of the Yan family noticed anything, it would be troublesome.

If Uncle Yan could see through Qin Yu’s identity, others in the Yan family could do the same.

After that, he sat cross-legged and began to absorb the dark energy of Xihuang Island.

The dark energy on Xihunag Island was extremely terrifying. Even Qin Yu felt chill all over.

For ordinary cultivators, this environment was simply hell on earth.

…

At the other end, the Si family had been waiting in Sky City for a long time. They still didn’t see Qin Yu leaving the city.

“That’s strange. Is Qin Yu really going to hide in Sky City?” Si Shifeng murmured.

After resting for several days, his body recovered well. Although he was not at his peak condition, it would not be a big problem for him to deal with Qin Yu.

“Could it be that he had found an opportunity to escape?” someone said.

Following that, everyone looked at Si Shiyue.

At this moment, Si Shiyue was drinking tea. He seemed to have comprehended something after the temple fair.

“Go to the Great Xia Royal Family and have them investigate,” Si Shiyue said indifferently.

The person by the side immediately bowed and said, “Yes.”

After that, Si Shiyue got up and looked at Si Shifeng, saying, “You stay here. I should go back now.”

Si Shifeng didn’t dare to hold Si Shiyue back. He quickly nodded and said, “Alright, Brother Yue. You go back first. Leave Qin Yu to me. Don’t worry. I’ll bring his body back in a few days.”

“Mmm,” Si Shiyue responded. He didn’t say anything else and left immediately.

After a few days of investigation, neither Great Xia Royal Family could find any trace of Qin Yu.

This made Si Shifeng feel uneasy.

They were very strict with their inspections and could quickly detect Qin Yu’s internal qi relying on their powerful divine sense. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Since they couldn’t find him, it would mean Qin Yu had left Sky City.

“Strange, how did this kid get out?” Si Shifeng took a deep breath and said in a low voice.

“Young Master Feng, what should we do now?” someone by the side asked.

After remaining silent for a while, Si Shifeng said, “Send people to investigate. No matter what, we must find traces of Qin Yu.”

“Yes!”

…

On Xihuang Island.

Eight days were gone in the blink of an eye. Qin Yu had no signs of stopping his absorption of dark energy.

After all, the speed of dark energy was not as fast as dragon blood. Based on Qin Yu’s prediction, it would probably take half a month.

...

During these eight days, the third princess came to Xihuang Island to visit Qin Yu every now and then. She was helpless each time she saw Qin Yu with his eyes closed. She could only secretly watch from the side.

“So good-looking!” the third princess said with infatuation on her face.

“Third Princess, do we need to wake him up?” someone by her side asked.

The third princess shook her head and said, “No. Let’s wait for him. We have plenty of time.”

Then the third princess looked at the person beside her and said, “You guys, seal off Xihuang Island. Don’t let him get away. I want to make him my toy.”

“Yes.” Several Semi-Saints didn’t dare to say much. They immediately activated their secret techniques and sealed off the entire Xihuang Island.

Qin Yu, in closed-door cultivation, was completely unaware of this. He greedily absorbed the dark energy. Although he was extremely fast, his body was like a bottomless pit that could not stop absorbing.

In the blink of an eye, half a month passed by. However, Qin Yu’s cultivation showed no signs of stopping.

Obviously, Qin Yu had overestimated himself. Half a month was not enough.

However, since he was already here, Qin Yu had no other choice but to speed up continuously.

Qin Yu did not have much time left. His look could only last for ten days at most. It meant he would expose his identity if he could not break through in ten days.

...

By then, not only would he offend the third princess, but he would also offend the Yan family.

Qin Yu could not feel the passing of time at all during his closed-door cultivation. Although he was somewhat anxious, he had no idea how much time had passed.

Soon, it was the last day of the one-month deadline.

That night, Qin Yu finally felt the signs of a breakthrough, but at the same time, the time was up.
