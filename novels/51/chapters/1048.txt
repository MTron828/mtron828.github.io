Chapter 1049: Chapter 1,049, the great battle began 

Following Gu Zizhen’s order, Chi Hou led a thousand martial marquis and marched out of the Heaven Gate!

The exit of the secret realm was opened, and Chi Hou led them out of the second secret realm.

They stepped into the martial arts association of Jingdu, and a thousand people were ready to go!

But no one noticed that just as they left, a figure sneaked into the second secret realm.

...

Demon City.

Qin Yu was lying on his jade bed as he said in a daze, “Immortal Crane, how many people do you plan to send to the Heaven Gate with me?”

“What do you think?”Immortal Crane took a sip of wine and asked.

Qin Yu thought for a moment and said, “I don’t know either. I don’t need too many people. After all, I have a plan.”

“Mm... three hundred people.”Immortal Crane Thought for a moment and said.

Qin Yu clapped his hands and said, “Okay, three hundred people are enough! Your men can at least fight against three of them, right?”

“More or less.”Immortal Crane yawned.

“We will set off tomorrow. You must have a good rest today.”

After saying that, immortal crane lay on the bed and fell asleep.

Qin Yu picked up Immortal Crane’s wine and drank it by himself.

“HMM, the wine here is really high,”Qin Yu muttered.

...

Heaven Gate.

The Heaven Gate led by Jiang he was developing in an orderly manner.

There were people coming in and out of the mystic realm for training every day.

The Spiritual Qi contained in this mystic realm was enough for all the disciples of the Heaven Gate to cultivate.

“According to this progress, it’s only a matter of time before the Heaven Gate becomes the number one sect,”Xu Huaigu said.

Jiang Gu, who was beside him, quickly added, “That’s right. With Mr. Qin’s current prestige, becoming the number one sect is not a problem at all!”

When Jiang he heard this, he slowly said, “Qin Yuzhi is not here. To him, this sect is just a springboard.”

“His ambition is not here? He has already stepped into the martial saint realm. What else is there to pursue?”Xu Huaigu asked.

Jiang he sighed and said, “That’s right. Martial saints have been the ultimate goal of martial artists for the past hundred years or even a few hundred years.”

“But in reality, the path of cultivation is long. This is only the beginning.”

Xu Huaigu and Jiang Gu instantly fell into silence.

That’s right. No one knew what the end point of the path of cultivation was.

They had only heard about the realms above the martial saint realm. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

No one had ever seen anything like moving mountains and overturning seas, destroying the heavens and destroying the earth, or crossing the void.

Just as they were chatting, a sense of danger quietly descended.

“Eh?”Jiang he frowned slightly as if he had sensed something.

“What a powerful force!”Soon, Xu Huaigu also realized that something was wrong!

Before they could react, Chi Hou had already led 1,000 martial marquis to the Heaven Gate!

This terrifying power instantly engulfed the entire Heaven Gate!

An ominous internal Qi gathered in everyone’s hearts.

“Who are you?”A disciple walked forward and asked tentatively.

Chi Hou glanced at him and then waved his hand. The terrifying power directly shook that disciple into a bloody mist!

When everyone saw this, their expressions changed drastically!

Chi Hou said coldly, “I am Chi Hou from the second mystic realm. I am under the orders of the Realm Master to go against the Heaven Gate!”

“Everyone listen up. Heaven Gate... Leave No one alive!”

“Yes!”

With the order given, the great battle instantly erupted!

A Thousand Martial Marquis. This power was enough to sweep through all the sects!

Chi Hou’s attitude was even more resolute. He did not give Jiang he and the others the chance to speak. He raised his hand and used a killing move!

Jiang he and Xu Huaigu quickly attacked in an attempt to stop this great battle!

However, at this moment, Chi Hou took a step forward and stood in front of Jiang he and Xu Huaigu.

“You must be the two top-notch martial artist from the Heaven Gate.”Chi Hou placed his hands behind his back and assumed the posture of a top-notch martial artist.

Jiang he said coldly, “Ask your people to stop.”

“Stop? I only came here for one purpose. To crush the Heaven Gate! Ask Me to stop? Do you think that’s possible?”Chi Hou laughed coldly.

“Where’s Qin Yu? Why isn’t he coming out to die?”

Xu Huaigu was about to speak, but Jiang he stopped him and said slowly, “We don’t need Qin Yu to deal with you. The two of us are enough. If you want to see Qin Yu, let Zhai Xing come.”

These words undoubtedly infuriated Chi Hou! He said with a cold face, “Do you think I’m not as good as Zhai Xing? Fine, then I’ll kill the two of You First!”

The great battle was about to start. Jiang he and Xu Huaigu faced off against Chi Hou. Their killing moves were fully displayed, and secret techniques emerged endlessly!

The earth was trembling, and the river was evaporating!

Although Jiang he and Xu Huaigu were both extremely powerful, Chi Hou was, after all, at the middle stage of the martial saint stage. He was a full stage higher than Jiang he and the others!

Soon, Xu Huaigu was defeated, and many parts of his body were damaged!

As a former top genius, Jiang he’s strength was naturally not inferior to Chi Hou. Even though he was a realm lower than Chi Hou, he was still not at a disadvantage!

Xu Huaigu stood up again and activated his trump card secret technique to fight with Chi Hou!

Both parties fought until the sky and earth turned dark, and the Sun and Moon lost their light! For a moment, they were in a stalemate!

Chi Hou laughed out loud. The more he fought, the more courageous he became. To him, as long as he could hold on to Jiang he and Xu Huaigu, it would be a great victory! After all, the disciples of the Heaven Gate were not a match for the disciples of his secret realm!

On the other hand, Jiang he and Xu Huaigu were worried about the disciples of the Heaven Gate. They even wanted to rescue Chi Hou. This also meant that they had no way of taking down Chi Hou!

The battle went from day to night. Blood flowed like a river in the Heaven Gate, and corpses littered the ground!

Although the second secret realm was also damaged, it was like a drop in the ocean compared to the Heaven Gate!

This battle had destroyed the Heaven Gate’s accumulation of several days!

The next morning, the battle still hadn’t ended.

Jiang he looked at Xu Huaigu and said, “Go and protect the heaven gate disciples. Leave this place to me.”

Xu Huaigu didn’t waste any time and nodded. “Okay, take care of yourself.”

Then, Xu Huaigu left the battlefield and rushed toward the surviving disciples.

“You dare to face me alone?”Chi Hou crossed his arms in front of his chest, looking extremely arrogant.

Jiang he didn’t say a word. He slowly moved his hands, and the fighting formula appeared in an instant! Jiang he’s internal Qi instantly increased by dozens of times!
