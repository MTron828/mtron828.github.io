“Could it be that what Miss Yan said is true?” This time, even Yan Jiang had some doubts.

At this moment, Qin Yu was sitting cross-legged on the bed.

He acted as if no one was around and didn’t care about the Jiang family at all.

“How should I use this dark energy?” Qin Yu tried to mobilize the dark energy in his body, but he found that he didn’t know how to use it at all.

Even the inheritance left by his father didn’t have any specific method to use dark energy.

“Looks like I can only rely on myself to figure it out,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

If he could combine dark energy and spiritual energy, Qin Yu’s strength would definitely increase once more.

Unfortunately, Qin Yu had no knowledge of how to do so!

“I’m afraid I won’t be able to think of a solution for a while.” Qin Yu shook his head.

The sky quickly darkened. At seven o’clock in the evening, Wei Ming drove to the hotel.

“Mr. Qin, it’s about time. We should set off,” Wei Ming said to Qin Yu.

Qin Yu nodded, then got into Wei Ming’s car.

Wei Ming brought Qin Yu to an extremely luxurious venue.

The venue looked extremely high-end, and admission tickets were required.

Updates by

Qin Yu took a closer look and realized that the people guarding the entrance were actually two Inner Strength Master Hands.

“This venue is quite extraordinary.” Qin Yu couldn’t help but sigh.

Wei Ming nodded and said, “The owner of this venue is very mysterious. Rumor has it that he is a person with extraordinary power.”

Qin Yu sighed slightly and said, “There are a lot of powerful low profile people in the provincial capital.”

“Indeed.” Wei Ming nodded. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“Rumor has it that three years ago, there was a martial artist who taught the Jiang family a lesson. Since then, the Jiang family has kept a much lower profile,” Wei Ming explained.

“Oh?” This made Qin Yu somewhat surprised.

The Jiang family’s behavior was so high-profile, yet they were actually keeping a low profile? Then how brazen had they been in the past?

“Let’s go.” Wei Ming brought Qin Yu into the venue.

The moment they stepped into the venue, Qin Yu smelled rich herbal aroma.

Sure enough, this place was much better than Yunsheng Street.

Inside the venue, there were counters one after another, and the goods sold at each counter were different.

There were bright paintings, medicinal herbs, antiques, and most surprisingly, there were also those who sold medical skills.

For example, they would treat people’s health and then collect money according to their condition.

“Mr. Qin, although this place is high-end, you still need to determine whether something is real or fake by yourself,” Wei Ming reminded him.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “I understand.”

No matter how high-end a place was, it was full of swindlers.

It was nothing more than the difference between a low-level swindler and a high-level swindler.

“Qin Yu!”

At this moment, a familiar voice suddenly came from behind Qin Yu.

After turning around, he found that the person who came was actually Wei Jiang! Beside him, there was an old man in a white robe.

“Mr. Wei? Why are you here?” Qin Yu couldn’t help but be a little surprised.

Wei Jiang laughed loudly and said, “I just had some free time recently, so I came out to play. As for you, you have been targeted by the Jiang family, but you still dare to come here so brazenly?”

Qin Yu forced a smile and said, “I didn’t expect that even you knew about this matter.”

“Now, everyone in Chuzhou is talking about it. Qin Yu, the last time I saw you, you were just a nobody. I didn’t expect you to become a famous person in Chuzhou now,” Wei Jiang said jokingly.

Qin Yu said helplessly, “Mr. Wei, please don’t make fun of me.”

“Hahaha!” Wei Jiang couldn’t help but laugh.

Since they had met, they would naturally stroll around together.

After a short conversation, he learned that Wei Jiang came here for stone gambling.

The wealthier the person, the more likely they were to gamble. Wei Jiang and Wei Ming were the same.

The reason Wei Ming knew about this venue was purely because of stone gambling.

“Rumor has it that there are many top-grade gems. If we’re lucky, it’s not impossible to make a fortune in one day.” Wei Jiang’s eyes lit up at the mention of stone gambling.

Wei Ming, on the other hand, scolded, “Don’t mention it. I’ve already lost several million here. I haven’t even earned a single cent.”

Wei Jiang laughed loudly and said, “Who isn’t like that? Because of this, I specially invited Mr. Qiu Feng. He’s a master in this field and also a good friend of mine. This time, let’s earn back all the losses!”

The old man called Qiu Feng nodded slightly as a greeting.

Wei Ming hurriedly nodded and said, “Then let’s not waste any more time. Let’s go now!”

Thus, the few of them walked towards the direction of the stone gambling venue.

This stone gambling venue was the distinguishing feature of this venue.

Rumor had it that the raw stones here all came from the southwest border.

At this moment, a large group of people gathered in the stone gambling venue. Their eyes were either burning with excitement or filled with dejection.

Qin Yu took a sweeping glance and was surprised to find that there were many martial artists here. Among them, there were three people that Qin Yu couldn’t see through at all.

“It’s a place full of low-key big shots.” Qin Yu couldn’t help but sigh.

Wei Ming and Wei Jiang entered the venue early. They glanced at these stones with strong anticipation in their eyes.

“Mr. Qiu, please help me take a look.” Wei Jiang said politely.

Qiu Feng waved his hand and said, “You can choose by yourself. Let me take a look after you’re done.”

“Okay!”

Wei Jiang and Wei Ming immediately felt invigorated. They chose from left to right and bought four to five raw stones.

“Mr. Qiu, these raw stones cost me more than three million. Please help me take a look,” Wei Jiang said excitedly.

Qiu Feng glanced at them and shook his head. “These are all trash. Wei Jiang, your taste is terrible.”

“What about me? Mr. Qiu, please help me take a look!” Wei Ming said anxiously.

Mr. Qiu looked at the raw stone in Wei Ming’s hand. A moment later, he picked out the smallest one from the raw stone.

“This one should be high quality, but it won’t make up for the cost,” Qiu Feng said.

Wei Jiang and Wei Ming didn’t seem to be convinced.

Although they weren’t experts in this field, they had played for many years and had some experience.

Therefore, they disregarded his remarks and immediately cut all the raw stones.

Unfortunately, everything was as Qiu Feng had expected.

Except for the one that Qiu Feng had his eyes on, the others were all useless.

“Mr. Qiu is quite sharp!” Wei Jiang and Wei Ming were thoroughly impressed!

Qiu Feng waved his hand and said, “With your judgement, I’m afraid you won’t be able to pick any decent raw stones.”

“How about this, I’ll pick. You guys pay and earn 50-50% . If you lose, you guys can deal with it yourselves,” Qiu Feng said.

“No problem!” Wei Ming and Wei Jiang agreed without thinking.

The few of them followed Qiu Feng and only used 40-50 minutes to earn more than two million.

This made Wei Ming and Wei Jiang even more impressed with Qiu Feng!

At this time, Qin Yu was also choosing.

He placed his hand on the raw stone and tried to feel it.

“This is it.” Qin Yu’s eyes lit up and he chose an extremely large raw stone.

Although Qin Yu didn’t know what was inside, he could clearly feel that there was a strong spiritual energy fluctuation inside.
