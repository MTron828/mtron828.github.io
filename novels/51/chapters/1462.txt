Chapter 1463: Chapter 1,463, Outstanding Talent of the Mo family

Hammer frowned and said, “Family head, you should be more careful. After all, we just killed that Fang...”

Hearing this, Mo Hong could not help but snort coldly and said, “That Fang is just a low-level nobody. If we kill him, so be it. He, Qin Yu, killed my son. I haven’t settled the score with him yet!”

If not for the fact that he was afraid of Qin Yu’s strength, Mo Hong would have Chopped Qin Yu into a thousand pieces long ago.

Fortunately, Mo Hong had many descendants. He had eighteen sons alone.

Among them, young master Mo, who was killed by Qin Yu, was only ranked second among his sons.

“Family head, what should we do now?”Hammer asked.

Mo Hong slowly stood up. He did not want to stir up trouble, so he naturally planned to calm things down.

“Go and tell him that all of his expenses today will be paid by my Mo family,”Mo Hong said with a faint smile.

Hammer heard this and quickly nodded, “Okay, I got it.”

Then, hammer turned around and walked out of the door.

Once he walked out, hammer could not help but curse, “D * mn, this old thing is really cowardly. Not only does he not dare to take revenge after his son was killed, he actually wants to show goodwill.”

Even though that was the case, he still followed Mo Hong’s request and returned to the gambling city.

At this moment, Qin Yu was sitting at a gambling table, quietly watching.

Qin Yu didn’t know much about gambling in the holy region, and all he knew was that there was only one gambling stone.

And the gambling here, in addition to using spirit coins, would also use one’s own foundation, such as cultivation techniques, heavenly and earthly treasures, and so on. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Some people even took out all the treasures they had on them.

Seeing these gamblers’red eyes, Qin Yu couldn’t help but Snort coldly.

He casually grabbed a person and threw him to the side, then put his feet on the table.

Seeing this scene, the people on the table all frowned and looked at Qin Yu.

“What do you mean?”The person who was thrown by Qin Yu was even more furious.

Qin Yu stretched and said, “I’m tired. Sit here and rest for a while.”

“Rest for a while? What the F * CK is wrong with you? Get lost!”The people on the table cursed.

At this moment, hammer walked over quickly.

He stood beside Qin Yu and bowed. “Greetings, Mr. Qin.”

Qin Yu glanced at him and said, “Who are you?”

“I’m the person in charge here. My name is hammer,”hammer said politely.

“Our Master specially instructed us to pay for all your expenses today,”hammer continued.

Qin Yu raised her eyebrows and couldn’t help but sneer, “Your master is quite filial.”

A trace of embarrassment flashed across Hammer’s face, and he didn’t know how to respond for a moment.

“Then what if I lose?”Qin Yu continued to ask.

Hammer said politely, “Mr. Qin, you win, and we’ll pay for the loss.”

As soon as these words were said, Qin Yu couldn’t help but burst into laughter.

He suddenly slapped the table, and then said coldly, “Since your mo family is so filial, then let the Mo family’s patriarch come and play a few rounds with me.”

Hammer flashed a trace of embarrassment and then said with a smile, “Mr. Qin, our patriarch is busy. Otherwise, he would definitely come to see you personally...”

“Oh, so?”Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and emitted a cold air.

Hammer couldn’t help but shiver. He said with a bit of fear, “Mr. Qin, you... Don’t make things difficult for me. I’m just a worker...”

“Okay, I won’t make things difficult for you. Go back and tell Mo Hong that I, Qin Yu, am waiting for him here. If he comes, I’ll only kill him alone. If he doesn’t come, I’ll kill his entire family,”Qin Yu said coldly.

Hammer sighed in his heart.

Sure enough, this Qin Yu wasn’t here to play at all. He was clearly here to find trouble.

“Hurry up and go. Why are you still standing there?”Qin Yu glared at him.

Hammer didn’t dare to say anything and turned around to leave.

“Who dares to speak so arrogantly in my Mo clan’s territory?”

At this moment, a voice suddenly sounded.

Raising his head, he saw a graceful young man walking over.

This person’s appearance was somewhat similar to that of the deceased young master Mo, but compared to that young master Mo, there was a bit more viciousness in his eyes.

“Who dares to speak nonsense here with such a big tone?”The young man quickly arrived in front of Qin Yu.

Seeing this young man, hammer hurriedly bowed and said, “Young master...”

The young man who was called Young Master ignored hammer. He sized up Qin Yu and said coldly, “Are you tired of living?”

Qin Yu raised her eyebrows and said with a faint smile, “Who are you?”

“I’m the young master of the Mo family, Mo Haoyan!”The young man shouted.

“Mo Haoyan? The most outstanding young master of the Mo Family?”

“Greetings, Young Master Mo!”Someone stood up and greeted.

Mo Haoyan looked at Qin Yu coldly and said, “Where did you come from? How dare you talk nonsense here?”

Hammer at the side hurriedly said, “Young Master Mo, this is Mr. Qin Yu...”

“What? He’s Qin Yu?”

“No wonder he’s so arrogant, daring to challenge the Mo family!”

“The Mo family is nothing, they don’t even put the Tianyun sect in their eyes!”

The surrounding people discussed animatedly, their eyes filled with intense fear.
