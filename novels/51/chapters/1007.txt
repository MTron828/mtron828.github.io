Chapter 1008: Chapter 1,008, the pill was completed

Qin Yu had already familiarized himself with the pill formula. He was even more adept at how to refine medicine.

The three of them walked together in front of the medicinal cauldron that had a dragon tattoo on it.

“You can handle it.”Xiang Danqing looked at Qin Yu.

Qin Yu grunted in gratitude. He took a deep breath and placed all the herbs into the medicinal cauldron.

Purple Flames lit up in the palms of the three people at almost the same time!

The Flames fell into the medicinal cauldron like three dazzling purple rays!

The rays of light connected to the hands of the three people, and the three of them refined the herbs together!

According to the requirements of the pill formula, the heavenly herbs had to be placed in last.

The process of refining the spirit recovery pill was extremely complicated and long. During this period, the fire temperature had to be constantly adjusted, and different herbs had to be continuously placed in.

The slightest carelessness could destroy this pill!

As he watched the three flames boil in the medicinal cauldron, Qin Yu suddenly felt as if he could feel the flames of the other two!

“These flames... seem to have fused together.”Qin Yu said with a frown.

“I feel it too.”Pavilion master said.

“En, I have the same feeling.”Xiang Danqing continued.

The three of them looked at each other. Just as they were puzzled, the three balls of flames suddenly burst out with a strange light!

They saw the three balls of flames rapidly merging in the medicinal cauldron!

In a moment, a small whirlpool formed in the medicinal cauldron!

All the herbs were sucked into it and turned into medicinal liquid in an instant!

“What’s going on?”Qin Yu hurriedly asked.

The knowledgeable pavilion master also shook his head and said, “I’ve never seen such a situation before.”

The whirlpool was still spinning crazily. Not only were the herbs sucked into it, the three balls of flames were the same!

“Hu!”

At this moment, it was as if a hurricane had risen from within the medicinal cauldron!

Immediately after, the three balls of flames that had fused together began to fuse!

Those three balls of flames that should have been purple actually turned seven-colored at this moment!

And this ball of flame seemed to be controlled by these three people at the same time!

“Seven-colored flame?”Qin Yu couldn’t help but widen his eyes!

Didn’t they say that the purple flame was the highest grade of flame? How did it become a seven-colored flame now?

“Could it be that... when three kinds of purple spiritual fire are fused together, they can produce a higher grade of Flame?”Pavilion master guessed.

“In other words, what is needed to refine the recovery spirit pill is not three kinds of purple spiritual fire, but this seven-colored flame?”Qin Yu also took over the conversation.

“It’s highly possible!”Xiang Danqing nodded and said.

Pavilion master glanced at Xiang Danqing and said, “Have you heard of these seven-colored flames?”

“No.”Xiang Danqing shook his head.

“I don’t care,”Qin Yu said in a deep voice.

“This pill formula is definitely not fake. Just follow the instructions on the pill formula.”

The two of them nodded and then closed their eyes slightly, controlling the flames with their whole body and mind.

The seven-colored flame was obviously more ferocious than the purple flame.

Not only could it dissolve the medicinal liquid faster, but it could also greatly improve the utilization of the herbs.

All the medicinal liquid merged into the seven-colored flame and then turned into Wisps of Mist.

Qin Yu controlled the spiritual fire and sealed the mist, afraid that it would spread out.

More than an hour passed. During this time, Qin Yu kept putting in the herbs.

These herbs first turned into medicinal juice, and then turned into Wisps of Mist.

The mist kept fusing in the medicinal cauldron, and finally turned into an extremely strange color.

This color was like green, but also had a hint of light blue.

And in the depths of these two colors, there were actually traces of blood-like color.

“According to the instructions on the pill formula, as long as you see this strange scene, it’s time to put in the heavenly vanilla.”Qin Yu looked at the two and said.

“And after putting in the heavenly vanilla, it’s the last step, the most important and most difficult step.”

Pavilion master and Xiang Danqing nodded, indicating that they were ready.

Qin Yu took a deep breath, took out the heavenly vanilla, and gently put it into the medicinal cauldron.

“Hu!”

The moment he put it in, the flame seemed to have lost control, and instantly became manic!

“Control the flame well!”Qin Yu hurriedly shouted.

Pavilion master and Xiang Danqing naturally did not dare to be negligent. They immediately closed their eyes slightly and focused on controlling the flame.

Within the medicinal cauldron, the flame was still incomparably manic, as if it wanted to burn out the fog formed by the medicinal juice!

And such a manic flame was unable to harm the heavenly vanilla in the slightest!

The heavenly vanilla lay within, not moving at all. It was not affected in the slightest.

“What’s going on?”Qin Yu asked with a frown.

“This heavenly vanilla can actually withstand this flame?”The Pavilion Master and Pavilion Master also exclaimed.

Qin Yu frowned slightly, but he did not dare to act rashly.

The pill formula did not record such a situation, which also caused Qin Yu to not dare to take the risk.

Therefore, the three of them did not say anything. They just quietly controlled the flame and looked at the heavenly vanilla.

Ten minutes had passed, but the heavenly vanilla still didn’t move.

“That’s not right,”Qin Yu said in a low voice.

“If the heavenly vanilla doesn’t dissolve, the pill will never take shape.”

“That’s right,”Xiang Danqing also said.

“Increase the strength of the Flame?”Pavilion master suggested.

Qin Yu was silent for a moment, then he gritted his teeth and said, “Forget it. Let’s do as pavilion master says. There are two more heavenly vanilla anyway!”

“En.” Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

The three of them looked at each other. At almost the same time, they increased the strength of the flames.

“Hu!”

The Flames instantly became even more manic!

All of the internal Qi seemed to be expanding under the envelopment of the flames, almost bursting the medicinal cauldron!

And the Sky Vanilla that had been silent all this time finally had a reaction!

“That’s it!”Qin Yu was overjoyed when he saw this!

The heavenly vanilla quickly began to condense, and traces of medicinal juice flowed out from it!

The three of them did not dare to be distracted. They controlled the strength of the Flames to keep it in this state.

A few minutes later, all of the Heavenly Vanilla’s medicinal juice flowed out.

Under the grilling of the seven-colored flame, the medicinal juice began to turn into fog.

Strands of mist fused into the internal Qi from before, and the already strange color added a touch of dark green!

“Yes, that’s it!”Qin Yu was overjoyed!

This was exactly the same as the situation recorded in the pill formula!

Next, it was time to wait for the pill to be completed!
