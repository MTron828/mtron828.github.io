1894 Talk Big

“F*ck you! Do you really think it’s cabbage by the roadside? If there’s one more, I’ll definitely go in with you!” the man with the mustache man mumbled.

“Are you in a hurry to go in?” Qin Yu said grinned and said. “Aren’t you afraid of being discovered by Saintee Gu?”

The man with the mustache sneered and said, “What’s there to be afraid of? I have many ways. It won’t be that easy for her to detect me.”

After saying that, the man with the mustache couldn’t help but sigh and say, “This thing is really a waste of you. If you go in, you’ll probably get only a few things.”

!!

Qin Yu sneered and said, “You’re wrong. If I can get in, I promise I’ll get more than you do.”

“Alright! Alright! Stop bragging. I’ll accept it.” the man with the mustache muttered.

Qin Yu didn’t explain to him. After all, he couldn’t tell anyone that her father had left behind the secret treasures.

Qin Yu was relieved with the holy robe from the man with the mustache.

Next, he just had to wait for the sanctum to open, and the treasures would be easy to get.

More than half of the sanctum had surfaced, and it seemed only a very small part remained hidden underground.

In the following few days, more and more people came to this place. They surrounded the vicinity of the sanctum, waiting for it to open.

Some people wanted a share of the loot, some wanted to comprehend the dao technique from it, and some just wanted to worship it.

A few days later, a war chariot flew across the sky. The chariot was extremely huge and had a majestic aura, attracting the attention of numerous people.

On the chariot, there was a huge character “Si”.

“People from the Si family have also come!” Qin Yu couldn’t help but be surprised.

He looked up and saw a young man standing on the deck of the Si family’s chariot.

This young man was full of arrogance and had a strong aura. His body was surging with an extraordinary internal qi.

“It seems that other families will also send people over,” Chang Mang said.

Qin Yu nodded and then said in a low voice, “It seems the man with the mustache was right. This incomplete sanctum is not worth the elders of the nine great aristocratic families coming out.”

The Gu family had sent their saintess, while the Si family had also sent a young man. This young man wasn’t even the strongest one. After all, everyone knew that the strongest person in the Si family was Si Shiyue.

The war chariot landed in a deserted place. The young man then got off.

Different from Saintess Gu, two elders were beside him. The two elders’ internal qi was so strong that no one could see through them.

“Tsk! Tsk! Si Shifeng has come,” someone by the side sighed and said.

“Si Shiyue, Si Shiyu, and Si Shifeng should be the three strongest of the Si family’s younger generation.”

“That’s right, but Si Shiyue should be the greatest. In the entire Holy Region, not to mention the younger generation, as long as they have not entered the True Saint realm, I’m afraid there are only a handful of people in the older generation who are comparable with him.”

Qin Yu snorted when he heard the discussion around him.

It seemed that this Si Shiyue had quite a few brothers. Apart from Si Shiyu and Si Shifeng, he probably had other brothers.

“Si Shifeng doesn’t look like a good person,” Chang Mang mumbled.

Qin Yu didn’t notice it, but he could feel that this Si Shifeng was extremely arrogant.

“The descendants of the Si family seem to be quite proud of themselves,” Qin Yu said in a low voice.

“Since the Si family is here, I guess the Yan family will be here as well,” Chang Mang said.

At the mention of the Yan family, Qin Yu could not help but feel a little nervous.

Speaking of which, Qin Yu had been looking forward to the Yan family the most.

“I wonder if the person who’s coming is Yan Ruoxue,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

Si Shifeng walked to Saintess Gu’s side and started talking to her.

The extremely arrogant Si Shifeng didn’t pay any attention to anyone else. It was as if in his eyes, everyone else was just a small fry that didn’t deserve to talk to him.

Compared to Si Shifeng, Saintess Gu was much more approachable.

“You might have a conflict with this kid,” Chang Mang said softly.

Qin Yu coldly snorted. He didn’t care about this Si Shifeng at all.

Another day passed.

The Yan family’s war chariot finally arrived.

Looking at the Yan family’s chariot flying across the sky, Qin Yu’s heart was in his mouth.

Staring at the Yan family’s war chariot, his heart was full of expectation. He couldn’t help clenching his fists.

But it was a pity that it was not Yan Ruoxue who had come but a young man.

This young man was wearing a long robe. He was handsome and had an extraordinary bearing. He looked noble and his natural temperament clearly indicated his identity.

“The Yan family has also sent people over.”

“It’s Yan Yunfan.”

“The person who came is Yan Yunfan!”

The surrounding people started to discuss in low voices. Perhaps it was because of his feelings for Yan Ruoxue, Qin Yu had a good impression of Yan Yunfan.

However, what they said subsequently changed Qin Yu’s mind.

“I heard Yan Yunfan’s relationship with the Yan family’s saintess isn’t good.”

“That’s for sure. Before Yan Ruoxue appeared, Yan Yunfan had always been with the most complete bloodline inheritance. He was heaven’s favorite, and everyone in the Yan family had almost treated him as the successor. In the end, the appearance of Yan Ruoxue completely caused him to fall from his divine altar.”

“That’s right. Rumor has it that Yan Yunfan and Yan Ruoxue’s relationship is very bad.”

“It’s because of this that I can’t figure out why the Yan family has sent Yan Yunfan here.”

...

Qin Yu stuck out his tongue. These great aristocratic families were strange. Even if they were family members, they could become enemies at anytime.

“Do we need to teach him a lesson?” Chang Mang mumbled as he rubbed his fists.

“Absolutely not!” Qin Yu quickly nodded and said. “There was no need! You’ll only be causing trouble for Yan Ruoxue!”

But unfortunately, it was too late.

Chang Mang had a straightforward personality. The moment he said those words, a wave of killing intent had already pounced on Yan Yunfan.

A character like Yan Yunfan could instantly sense the killing intent of Chang Mang.

He frowned slightly, and his expression turned cold as his gaze quickly landed on Chang Mang.

Qin Yu rubbed his forehead, feeling a terrible headache.

Soon, Yan Yunfan walked over to Chang Mang.

Their eyes met, and the atmosphere became extremely strange. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Yan Yunfan was very tall, but compared with Chang Mang’s Tower-like figure, he was like a junior meeting a senior.

...

Even so, Yan Yunfan’s aura was not any weaker than Chang Mang’s.

“Why?” he looked at Chang Mang coldly and asked. “Do you have anything against me?”

“Hmph!” Chang Mang snorted coldly and said, “So what if I do or if I don’t?”

Qin Yu didn’t want to get into trouble. Thus he quickly tried to smooth things over, “He’s mistaken you for someone else. Please ignore him, Young Master Yan.”

“Mistaken?” Yan Yunfan’s face turned cold, and he said coldly, “You’ve mistaken me, so you should also die!”

“You talk so big!” Chang Mang immediately took a step forward, and his internal qi exploded!

Qin Yu sighed.

It seemed like it was impossible to end things amicably. Qin Yu no longer wasted any more time and immediately stood beside Chang Mang.
