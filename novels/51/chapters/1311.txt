Chapter 1312: Chapter 1312, encountering the Golden Wheel by chance 

Sister Lin saw how anxious Qin Yu was, so she didn’t keep him in suspense anymore.

She said seriously, “Life qi is very rare. Most of them are born in the chaos of Heaven and earth, or live in the body of some creature.”

“In the past few years at the auction, I have accumulated a lot of resources. One of my clients might have life qi.”

Qin Yu hurriedly asked, “Client? where is he?”

Sister Lin smiled and said, “I’ll give you the contact details later, but... life energy is so precious. Whether you can get it or not depends on your own ability.”

“Thank you, Sister Lin!”Qin Yu held back his excitement and said.

At this time, the people of Ju Xian restaurant had already served the food.

Sister Lin took a bite of the food and said while eating, “By the way, what do you want life energy for?”

Qin Yu frowned. He didn’t know how to explain himself.

“If you don’t want to tell me, just pretend that I didn’t ask,”sister Lin said with a smile. “But... how are you going to thank me?”

Qin Yu smiled bitterly. “With my current ability, I’m afraid I can’t help you much.”

Sister Lin rolled her eyes. “You’re too modest. I heard about your battle with Ling Yun a few days ago. It’s not easy for a freelance martial artist like you to defeat Ling Yun.”

“Sister Lin, you flatter me. Just treat it as I owe you a favor. If you need me in the future, just say the word, sister Lin,”Qin Yu said.

Sister Lin raised her eyebrows and said, “Then I’ll take it seriously.”

Qin Yu nodded repeatedly. “It’s a deal.”

Then, the two of them chatted as they ate.

However, in the short time that Qin Yu had stepped into the holy region, he had suffered two betrayals. Therefore, he didn’t dare to trust anyone.

After the meal, Sister Lin took out a note and handed it to Qin Yu.

“There’s his address on it, but I guess he’s traveling now. You’d better wait before you set off,”said sister Lin.

Qin Yu took the note and glanced at the address on it. He found it to be a very unfamiliar place.

Fortunately, Qin Yu still had a map in his hand, so it wasn’t difficult to find him.

“I’m a little curious. Why didn’t you choose to join a sect?”Sister Lin asked curiously with her hand supporting her chin.

Qin Yu was silent for a moment, then sighed and said, “Do you think anyone would still want me now? I’ve offended the Heavenly Cloud sect. Who would want to provoke this trouble?”

Sister Lin smiled and said, “Perhaps no one in the South Province is willing to take this risk, but not necessarily outside the South Province.”

Qin Yu nodded and said, “Yes, I have indeed considered it, but leaving the South Province is not an easy matter... moreover, there is an irreconcilable conflict between me and the Heavenly Cloud Sect.”

Qin Yu, who had always taken revenge for the smallest grievance, would definitely not let the heavenly cloud sect off easily.

In the eyes of outsiders, Qin Yu’s actions were like an egg hitting a rock. Only Qin Yu knew his own ability.

“Sister Lin, if there is any life force in the auction, please keep an eye out for me,”Qin Yu said.

Sister Lin smiled. “Okay, then you owe me a second favor.”

As she said this, Qin Yu suddenly saw a familiar figure from the corner of his eye.

“HMM?”Qin Yu frowned, and a cold look flashed across his face.

“Jin Lun... I didn’t expect to see you here.”

Qin Yu slowly stood up. He looked at sister Lin and said, “Sister Lin, I have something to take care of. I’ll visit you another day.”

After saying this, Qin Yu hurriedly walked in the direction of Jin Lun.

Even though Jin Lun covered his face, his huge body was too eye-catching, and it was unforgettable.

Qin Yu walked all the way to his back and raised his hand to put it on Jin Lun’s shoulder.

A huge force grabbed Jin Lun tightly, afraid that he would escape.

“Jin Lun, we meet again,”Qin Yu said coldly.

Hearing this, Jin Lun’s expression changed drastically!

He suddenly raised his head and wanted to leave, but Qin Yu’s palm force was too strong, making him unable to move.

Jin Lun gritted his teeth, took a deep breath, and said, “What do you want to Do?”

Qin Yu said coldly, “You killed the team leader. What do you think I want to Do?”

“Hehe, don’t you think there’s something fishy about the matter of the team leader?”Jin Lun said coldly. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes. “What do you mean?”

“Why don’t we sit down and have a chat?”Jin Lun said.

Qin Yu sneered and said, “There’s nothing to talk about between us. If you have something to say, just say it.”

Jin Lun knew that Qin Yu was not someone to be trifled with. He looked at Qin Yu coldly with a hint of hatred in his eyes.

“The real killers aren’t me. It’s Zhong Wu and Ling Yun!”Jin Lun said coldly.

Qin Yu’s expression changed slightly.

It was exactly what he had thought.

Following that, Jin Lun told Qin Yu everything that had happened.

“I never thought that I would be used by Zhong Wu!”Jin Lun clenched his fists, his eyes wide open.

“No wonder the white bone scepter appeared in his hands...”Qin Yu whispered.

Jin Lun raised his head and looked at Qin Yu, saying, “I also don’t want to cut Zhong Wu into pieces! It’s a pity that I don’t have the chance.”

“Is that so?”Qin Yu couldn’t help but sneer.

“No matter what, the person who killed the team leader was indeed you. You must pay the price for this.”Qin Yu’s voice was extremely cold, and Jin Lun’s heart couldn’t help but thump.
