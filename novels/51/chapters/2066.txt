2067 The Impact on Faith

Knowing this kid was extremely vicious, Qin Yu said smiling, “How about… Holy Son Jiang go first? When the time comes, I’ll bring you some fresh soil from here and some chaotic qi. How about that?”

“That won’t do. I must guarantee your safety! After all, you are Jiang He’s friend!” Jiang Wushuang said righteously.

Qin Yu rolled his eyes and said, “Forget it. Just say it if you don’t dare to go in. t. You’re afraid, but I’m not.”

“Brother Qin, what are you saying? What do I fear? I just don’t want to take your credit!” Holy Son Jiang chuckled and said.

Qin Yu was too lazy to continue bickering with him. He thus took the lead to walk into the Chaos Grave.

The moment he stepped into the Big Graves, a tremendously powerful killing intent instantly surged out, and the terrifying chaotic qi inside the Chaos Grave made him feel incredibly uncomfortable.

Looking into the distance, one could see a faint light.

With the help of this light, one could see very vaguely.

Soon Holy Son Jiang behind him caught up. He held the supreme bone in his hand, afraid that something untoward would happen.

“Why? Are you so scared of death?” Qin Yu said jokingly.

After saying that, Qin Yu also took out the supreme bone and walked forward nervously.

After taking a few steps forward, an incredibly horrifying scene appeared in front of them!

They saw several incredibly horrifying figures which looked like humans and ghosts. Some were headless, some had eyes on their arms, and some even had multiple heads!

The internal qi of these creatures was tremendously terrifying. They were many times stronger than the mysterious green creature back then.

It was not exaggerating to say that a wisp of their internal qi could kill the two of them here!

Qin Yu and Holy Son Jiang’s expressions instantly changed drastically. The two stepped back almost simultaneously!

“What… What is this…” Qin Yu, sweating profusely, was tremendously terrified!

It was the same with Holy Son Jiang. He said in a low voice, “These people… no, the internal qi of these things has surpassed the True Saint cultivation realm. How do such things live in the Chaos Grave?”

The only good thing was that these creatures had no intention of attacking them. However, their gazes never left Qin Yu and Holy Son Jiang.

“If I’m not wrong, these are the things that the ones who died here, as well as Yan Guyun and Si Liuhe, had encountered,” Qin Yu said in a deep voice.

“That’s right. With their strength, they really can’t be compared to these things. It’s just that… where did these things come from? Why haven’t I seen them before? Could it be a new species? Or the demon race?”

“No.” Qin Yu took a deep breath. ” This is a powerful creature born from chaotic qi.”

“Oh? Brother Qin knows about it?” Holy Son Jiang said in surprise.

Holy Son Jiang nodded slightly as if he felt that it made sense.

The high and mighty Holy Son Jiang no longer had any ideas at this moment. He had regarded Qin Yu as his backbone.

“Brother Qin, since we’re fully prepared, will these things attack us?” Jiang Wushuang asked tentatively.

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “I don’t know. Why don’t you go and try? As the Holy Son of the Jiang family, you should have some life-saving means!”

“F*ck you! Even a tribulation magical artifact couldn’t withstand them. What means can you use to save your life?” Holy Son Jiang immediately shrank his head, reluctant to step closer.

Qin Yu was silent. He had come this far, so he definitely could not go back off like this.

Therefore, Qin Yu held the supreme bone in his hand, and the Mysterious Heavenly Mirror above his head. He braced himself and walked in.

Those densely packed gazes instantly fell onto Qin Yu’s body, and the coldness that erupted from their eyes became even more terrifying!

A mere gaze would make Qin Yu feel chill all over and tremble endlessly!

However, Qin Yu still braced himself and walked in.

To avoid accidents, he only needed to bite his finger and let the blood spurt out. At the same time, he also took out the remaining supreme bones!

“D*mn, you actually have a complete skeleton?” Holy Son Jiang was stunned when he saw the scene.

“To be precise, there are two,” Qin Yu said coldly.

Holy Son Jiang opened his mouth in tremendous shock.

Qin Yu was not in the mood to pay attention to him. He was fully focused on watching these creatures and carefully walked in.

The gazes of these creatures became increasingly colder, and their bodies trembled slightly as if they were about to attack.

Behind him, Holy Son Jiang stopped in his tracks. He seemed to be starting to feel afraid.

“Qin Yu, why don’t you give me a drop of blood essence and the remaining skeleton? It’s useless to keep it anyway,” Holy Son Jiang muttered.

Qin Yu naturally ignored him. He ignored Holy Son Jiang and continued walking deeper in.

This journey could be said to be filled with fear and trepidation as if they were treading on thin ice. They might die if they were not careful.

Soon, Qin Yu disappeared from Holy Son Jiang’s line of sight.

Holy Son Jiang, who was already terrified, instantly became even more scared.

He opened his mouth, wanting to call out Qin Yu’s name, but was afraid he would accidentally alarm these terrifying creatures.

In the end, Holy Son Jiang could only stay where he was with a bitter expression.

Qin Yu continued to walk in. The creatures that grew inside were even stronger.

When Qin Yu walked into the depths, he could even feel an unknown power!

This power was so terrifying that it was indescribable. It was as if he was facing a black hole. The mysterious pressure made it difficult for one to breathe! 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

It was the fear that rose from the bottom of his heart. He could not resist it at all. Even though Qin Yu had made up his mind, he instantly stopped on the spot and dared not take another step closer. He even had the intention to back off!

“This mysterious feeling… What’s going on? It seems to be much stronger than the True Saint. Could it be that Wu Ji actually didn’t die…” Qin Yu’s forehead was covered in sweat, and he relied on the only trace of rationality he had and continued to analyze.

“Or rather… This chaotic qi has produced a terrifying level that no cultivator can understand…”

Qin Yu kept cheering himself on in his heart, but his legs seemed to be filled with lead, and he could not move at all.

His body was trembling non-stop. It was difficult for a person in fear to make a rational judgment.

Qin Yu, being able to stand here, was already tremendously terrifying.

Qin Yu closed his eyes and tried to calm himself down with all his might.

Countless thoughts continuously collided in his mind, attacking his faith and state of mind. Qin Yu’s brain was almost about to explode!

“No, absolutely no way…” At this moment, Qin Yu even wanted to be a cowardly person. He even had the thought of committing suicide!
