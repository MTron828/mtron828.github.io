Chapter 221: Ravenous! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Qin Yu absorbed the dark energy with hunger and thirst. For a moment, the spiritual energy seemed to be suppressed, and there was no movement in his body!

This was the first time Qin Yu felt an endless amount of dark energy!

He even felt that this dark energy couldn’t be completely absorbed!

“The ancestor really didn’t lie to me,” Qin Yu muttered in a low voice.

He didn’t know how much time he would have to spend in meditation this time!

Because it was almost impossible to completely absorb this dark energy!

Time passed by minute by minute, and in the blink of an eye, a day and a night had passed.

And Qin Yu’s strength had successfully advanced from the third level of the Foundation Establishment Stage to the fourth level!

His body flashed with a golden light, so the golden light stuck to his skin layer by layer, as if it had been absorbed by his skin.

Qin Yu’s body became even tougher!

This wasn’t the end, because the dark energy still was not depleted!

In the blink of an eye, another three days had passed!

During these three days, Qin Yu didn’t eat, drink, or sleep, and desperately absorbed the dark energy from the mark!

The surrounding temperature became extremely cold, and even the flowers and plants began to slowly wither!

Updates by

No one knew how long Qin Yu would take to meditate this time.

...

In the Jiang family, ever since the Jiang family announced that they were allied with Qin Yu, their status had been declining at a speed visible to the naked eye.

It was almost impossible to see the Jiang family rising to dominance again.

“Dad, are we just going to admit defeat like this?” Jiang Yu sat at the side and muttered.

Jiang Gu looked at Jiang Yu coldly and couldn’t help but curse, “It’s all because of you, you piece of trash! If it wasn’t for you, the Jiang family wouldn’t have encountered this disaster and your brother wouldn’t have died!”

Jiang Gu didn’t dare to make a sound after being scolded.

“Useless trash!” Jiang Gu scolded.

“Hehe, you want to vent your anger on your son because you’re not capable enough?”

At this moment, a voice suddenly came from outside.

After looking up, he saw a figure that looked like an iron tower standing at the door!

His body was extremely muscular and his muscles were bulging, giving off an oppressive aura.

“Who are you?” Jiang Gu’s expression changed slightly, and his face was filled with vigilance.

This person’s figure was huge, but he appeared in front of him as stealthy as a ghost!

This was enough to prove that the man in front of him wasn’t some average Joe!

“Of course I’m here to help you.” The brawny man slowly walked in front of Jiang Gu and sat down on his own.

Jiang Gu frowned slightly. He looked at Jiang Yu and waved his hand. “You can go out first.”

“Give me some money first. I’m going out for a party tonight. I don’t have any money,” Jiang Yu said obsequiously.

When he heard this, Jiang Gu became even angrier.

He had been so high and mighty all his life. How could he give birth to such a good-for-nothing?!

“Go and get it from Mr. Zhong!” Jiang Gu said while holding back his anger.

“Thanks, Dad!” Jiang Yu was instantly overjoyed and ran out.

Jiang Gu stretched out his hand and closed the door.

Then, he looked at the burly man in front of him and said coldly, “What do you mean?”

The strong man smiled and said, “Do you want to be suppressed by Qin Yu for the rest of your life?”

Jiang Gu was silent.

Of course he didn’t want to! Jiang Gu, who used to be the sole top dog of Chuzhou, wasn’t willing to submit to a junior!

“Who are you?” Jiang Gu asked as he sized up the brawny man in front of him.

The brawny man smiled nonchalantly and said, “My name is Hui Ming, and I come from the Earth Fiend Valley.”

When he heard the words ‘Earth Fiend Valley’, Jiang Gu’s expression changed slightly!

As an Inner Strength Grandmaster, he had naturally heard of the Earth Fiend Valley!

This was a sect that everyone wanted to beat up! Rumor had it that they were hiding in the southwest and cultivating evil techniques. Who knew how many people they had harmed?!

“As long as you cooperate with our Earth Fiend Valley, you will once again become the top dog of Chuzhou.” Hui Ming’s expression was somewhat proud.

He looked at Jiang Gu with confidence.

Hui Ming was very self-assured. He believed that Jiang Gu wouldn’t refuse the invitation of the Earth Fiend Valley.

However, Jiang Gu shook his head.

“I’m sorry. I’m not interested in the Earth Fiend Valley. Please leave immediately,” Jiang Gu said with a cold expression.

When he heard this, Hui Ming frowned immediately.

“What? Is the Earth Fiend Valley unworthy?” Hui Ming said with an unfriendly tone.

Jiang Gu said with a cold expression, “Since I’ve agreed to submit to Qin Yu, I won’t go back on my words. Please leave immediately!”

Hui Ming narrowed his eyes and said coldly, “Jiang Gu, I hope you’ll think about it carefully.”

“I said, I won’t agree. Leave the Jiang family’s home immediately!” Jiang Gu scolded.

When he heard this, Hui Ming couldn’t help but laugh out loud. “I really didn’t expect that Jiang Gu, who is known as the invincible in Chuzhou, would be scared to death by a junior!”

Jiang Gu said coldly, “That’s still better than you guys living in a corner like maggots.”

Anger flashed across Hui Ming’s face, and a terrifying internal qi burst from his body!

The entire room instantly vibrated, like there was an earthquake!

The furniture in the room also shattered!

Jiang Gu’s expression changed slightly.

Hui Ming’s strength had clearly exceeded his expectations!

“What do you mean? Do you want to make a move?” Jiang Gu forced himself to remain calm.

Hui Ming said coldly, “Jiang Gu, I came to cooperate with you because I’m showing you respect. Don’t be so shameless.”

Jiang Gu snorted coldly. An internal qi also burst out from his body. He said in a neither servile nor overbearing manner, “I’ve made myself clear. Please leave immediately!”

Hui Ming sneered again and again. He stood up and said, “I hope you won’t regret it.”

After saying that, Hui Ming turned around and left.

Jiang Gu couldn’t help but sigh in relief.

He didn’t expect that the Earth Fiend Valley would come looking for him.

After Hui Ming left, Mr. Zhong quickly walked in.

“Master, why didn’t you agree to it?” Mr. Zhong, somewhat puzzled, asked.

Jiang Gu glanced at Mr. Zhong and snorted coldly. “The Earth Fiend Valley’s strength is indeed powerful, but they cower in the southwest and don’t have the guts to be in the public eye! Me cooperating with them? In their dreams!”

Mr. Zhong suddenly came to a realization.

If it was a first-rate aristocratic family from Jingdu who came to cooperate, Jiang Gu wouldn’t even think about it and immediately agree.

But the Earth Fiend Valley... Although they were powerful, they were nothing compared to the Yan family in Jingdu.

This was modern society after all. If they really pushed the Yan family into a corner, they could directly use war means to flatten the Earth Fiend Valley!

“Don’t let this matter spread,” Jiang Gu glanced at Mr. Zhong and said.

“Also, inform Qin Yu immediately,” Jiang Gu continued.

Mr. Zhong nodded and said, “Yes.”

After Mr. Zhong received the order, he quickly went out and prepared to find Qin Yu.

“Where are you going?” However, just as Mr. Zhong got into the car, a gloomy voice came from behind!

When he looked back, he saw that this person was Hui Ming!

...

At this moment, Qin Yu was still ravenously absorbing the dark energy.

In just a few days, Qin Yu’s strength had increased once again!

He had successfully advanced from the third level of the Foundation Establishment Stage to the fifth level! And he still had no signs of stopping! CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Qin Yu almost lost his rationality!

“If I can directly reach the Monastic Stage, then what’s there to be afraid of in this world?!” Qin Yu became even more berserk!
