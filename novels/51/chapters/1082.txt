Chapter 1083: Chapter 1,083, forcing Yan Jinyao into a corner 

At this moment, Qin Yu was like an undefeatable war god as he walked towards Yan Jinyao.

Yan Jinyao’s face was filled with shock as he conjured spells with his hands. One after another, he approached Qin Yu’s glabella.

However, these spells were unable to stop Qin Yu from taking even half a step forward. All of the spells were shattered by Qin Yu’s Vajra body!

Seeing Qin Yu getting closer and closer, Yan Jinyao’s heart became more and more terrified.

All of his spells seemed to be unable to penetrate Qin Yu’s body!

Although his body was covered in bloody scars, his Qi and blood were even more powerful, so powerful that people did not dare to look directly at him!

“Swoosh!”

At this moment, Qin Yu suddenly stepped on the ‘xing’Word formula and instantly appeared in front of Yan Jinyao!

Yan Jinyao roared angrily and waved his hands. Three hundred and twenty-one purple dragons shot out from his sleeves!

The Dragon’s roar shook the heaven and earth. The purple light soared into the sky and headed straight for Qin Yu!

When everyone saw this, they were all extremely nervous!

This technique was Yan Jinyao’s foundation technique. It was said that when he was fifteen years old, he had already comprehended this technique. It could destroy the heaven and earth, and its power was unparalleled!

Qin Yu’s eyes flashed with indifference. He suddenly clenched his fists, leaving afterimages in the air as he smashed towards the overlapping Purple Dragons!

“Boom!”

As he punched out, golden light instantly shot out. The 321 overlapping purple dragons instantly turned into dust as they were pierced through by Qin Yu’s fists!

Such a powerful strength made everyone gasp!

“What a powerful physical strength!”

Anyone could see that Qin Yu relied on pure physical strength. It was incomparably tough and could shatter everything in the world!

Yan Jinyao’s expression changed drastically. Before he could recover, Qin Yu had already thrown out a second punch!

The golden light approached and landed on Yan Jinyao’s chest.

With a loud bang, Yan Jinyao’s chest immediately sank and his body fell to the ground!

It was obvious who was stronger and who was weaker!

Qin Yu’s every move was extremely sharp but also extremely easy.

On the other hand, Yan Jinyao did not have this kind of calmness. He crawled up from the ground, and his chest flickered with a red light, as if his blood was about to be evaporated!

Yan Jinyao stood up from the ground. He looked at the fresh blood flowing out from his chest, and his expression became increasingly unsightly.

Qin Yu’s strength seemed to have exceeded his imagination!

“Yan Jinyao, if you still have any ability, then use it. Today, I will let the world know that you, the number one disciple, have an undeserved reputation!”Qin Yu said coldly.

These words undoubtedly made Yan Jinyao feel embarrassed. He glared angrily at Qin Yu and shouted, “Qin Yu, don’t be so arrogant. Don’t think that I’m afraid of You!”

After saying that, Yan Jinyao’s hands quickly moved, and the purplish-gold light condensed again.

He flicked his palm forward, and the purplish-gold light quickly spread out in all directions, all the way to Qin Yu’s feet!

“Weng!”

There was a slight disturbance in the air, and the purplish-gold light gave off a blazing heat. Then, under Yan Jinyao’s urging, it transformed into a great seal!

This great seal had been passed down in the Scripture Depository of the martial arts association in Jingdu. Its power was incomparably terrifying, and it was incomparably difficult to learn this technique!

And as a genius of this era, Yan Jinyao had actually comprehended this technique!

“Nebula Great Seal!”

Yan Jinyao roared angrily, and the sky was instantly covered by this violet-gold great seal, surging forward in a mighty manner!

At this moment, countless people felt their hearts tremble with fear! The nebula seal was so tyrannical!

“The Jingdu martial arts association has already been defeated by me, and his technique isn’t even worth mentioning!”Qin Yu roared angrily, and his fist rapidly condensed into a fluorescent light.

Qin Yu took a step forward, and his Golden Fist shot out like a cannon, colliding with the large seal in the simplest manner!

In this instant, residual power spread out in all directions, forcing the surrounding realm lords to directly retreat!

And on the large nebula seal, densely packed cracks appeared!

“Kacha!”

Along with a clear sound, the large nebula seal finally exploded!

Qin Yu’s fist penetrated the seal and headed straight for Yan Jinyao with a crushing force!

Yan Jinyao had nowhere to hide and his body took the punch head-on!

“Deng Deng Deng!”

His body took a few steps back as he spat out a mouthful of blood!

What was even more shocking was that the purplish-gold light on Yan Jinyao’s body became extremely dim as if it was going to disappear at any moment!

This indicated that Yan Jinyao’s injuries were extremely serious, and his internal Qi was beginning to wither!

When everyone saw this, they were all shocked!

Both of them were geniuses, and they were even hailed as the two most powerful people in the current era!

The comparison of the strength of the two of them was even more widely spread. However, after today’s battle, they suddenly discovered that there seemed to be a huge gap in strength between the two of them!

Looking at Qin Yu, a golden aura suddenly surged. He was shockingly at his peak.

Looking at Yan Jinyao again, it was clear that he was beginning to show signs of defeat!

“Ah! !” UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Yan Jinyao was unwilling to give up. He roared angrily and his hair danced wildly. His palm suddenly shook forward, and then a purple longsword appeared in his palm!

Seeing this purple longsword, everyone immediately turned pale with fright!

“It’s the purple cloud sword that was lost decades ago. I didn’t expect it to be hidden in Yan Jinyao’s body!”Someone exclaimed.

The purple cloud sword had a great background. It was said that Luo Jingyu had paid countless treasures to find it back then!

The purple cloud sword was full of energy, and the blade of the sword emitted a buzzing sound like a dragon’s roar.

What was more shocking was that the killing intent on this sword was extremely strong, as if it had come from a battlefield!

“The sword is not bad, but it also depends on who uses it,”Qin Yu said coldly.

Yan Jinyao’s body was covered in blood, and his eyes were as if he had gone mad. He said furiously, “Qin Yu, I heard that your swordsmanship is superb. Today, I will compete with you!”

“Swordsmanship? I don’t even need to draw my sword to kill you,”Qin Yu said coldly.

He shook his iron fists and said coldly, “Just the pair of iron fists in my hands are enough to smash you into meat paste!”

“You are courting death!”

Yan Jinyao was extremely furious. He held the Purple Cloud Sword and charged at Qin Yu!

The purple cloud sword was stained with internal Qi. This sword was the essence of sword techniques!

Wherever it passed, there seemed to be a mark in the void.

Even though they were far away, everyone could feel the cold chill on the blade of the sword!

“Such a precious sword is wasted in your hands!”Qin Yu said coldly. With a furious roar, his golden aura erupted to the extreme!

Then, they saw Qin Yu raise both of his hands. His incomparably hot golden palms met the purple longsword!

He wanted to use his bare hands to forcefully resist the purple cloud sword that resounded throughout the world!

“Swoosh!”

The instant the Purple Cloud sword descended, Qin Yu raised both of his hands and grabbed the purple cloud sword in his palms!

An extremely hot golden aura instantly melted the internal Qi on the Purple Cloud Sword!

Even the sword wielder, Yan Jinyao, could feel the heat!

“How is this possible! ?”

Seeing this scene, everyone sucked in a breath of cold air!

Qin Yu actually used his bare hands to receive the sword unscathed!
