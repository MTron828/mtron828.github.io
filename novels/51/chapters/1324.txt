Chapter 1325: Chapter 1,325: Internal Qi 

Qin Yu’s Iron Fist arrived in front of him in the blink of an eye!

But at this moment, the mysterious creature suddenly disappeared!

In just a short moment, it disappeared without a trace!

“Hahaha! Did you see that? I told you he was bragging!”Ah San shouted excitedly.

Qin Yu frowned slightly. He looked around vigilantly and was ready at any moment.

But at this moment, the huge figure suddenly appeared behind Ah San.

Ah San, who was laughing crazily, instantly felt a trace of fear.

He swallowed his saliva and felt a chill on his back.

“Run quickly!”Qin Yu shouted.

However, it was too late. The huge sharp blade directly pierced towards AH San’s chest and heart!

Qin Yu gritted his teeth. He used all his strength and quickly arrived in front of Ah San.

However, the speed of that thing was too fast. Even if Qin Yu tried his best, he could only push Ah San away a little.

That Claw still pierced into his chest. It was only half a centimeter away from his heart!

Fresh blood instantly gushed out.

“AH SAN!”Wan ‘er immediately cried out in alarm, and she hurriedly ran towards Ah San.

But at this moment, Qin Yu pulled Wan ‘er to the side, and then took this opportunity to smash his fist towards the creature’s head.

A one-hit Kill!

This was the manifestation of Qin Yu’s battle intent, and it was incomparably terrifying.

That huge figure slowly fell down.

Qin Yu frowned. He looked coldly at AH San and said, “You are really an idiot.”

Ah San kept spitting out blood from his mouth. He opened his mouth and said in a trembling voice, “You... you really didn’t rely on a magic weapon... I admit defeat...”

“Idiot.”Qin Yu immediately felt a little speechless.

At this moment, he was still thinking about this.

Qin Yu used the desolate God’s eye to scan his body. Fortunately, his heart was not injured.

Normally, this injury would not be fatal.

But here, the spiritual energy in his body was completely suppressed. His recovery ability was similar to that of an ordinary person.

If he was not treated, he might really die here.

“What should I do... Ah San... you can’t die...”Wan ‘er grabbed Ah San’s arm, tears streaming down her face.

Ah San opened his mouth and laughed, “Miss Wan ‘er... seeing that you care so much about me... even if I die, it will be worth it...”

Qin Yu rubbed his head and couldn’t help but sigh:

Licking a dog was really awesome.

“Alright, you won’t die.”Qin Yu walked in front of him, then pulled off his clothes and bandaged his wounds.

Apart from that, Qin Yu took out a pill from the spatial magic artifact.

This pill was refined by Qin Yu when he was on Earth. Although it couldn’t heal his injuries, it could save his life.

Qin Yu handed the pill to AH SAN and said, “Swallow it.”

“YOU MOTHERF * cker... Don’t want to harm me...”Ah San said in a trembling voice. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Eat it or not.”Qin Yu got up and was about to leave.

Wan ‘er quickly took the pill and stuffed it into Ah San’s mouth.

After the pill entered his stomach, Ah San’s condition was clearly much better.

With Qin Yu’s bandaging, he could be considered to have saved his life.

“How do you feel now?”Wan ‘er said as she supported AH SAN.

Ah San waved his hand and said somewhat weakly, “Much better than before...”

Wan ‘er heard this and hurriedly bowed to Qin Yu. “Young Master Qin, thank you for saving my life.”

Qin Yu snorted and didn’t say anything.

Just as he was about to continue moving forward, ah San said with a trembling voice, “Qin Yu, thank you for saving me twice. I owe you two lives.”

Qin Yu stopped in his tracks.

He glanced at AH SAN and snorted, “Your life is of no use to me. As long as you keep your mouth shut from now on, it will be fine.”

At this moment, ah San was truly convinced.

Qin Yu had used his fists to kill that terrifying creature and saved his life twice.

No matter how jealous he was, he felt inferior.

“Miss Wan ‘er, take good care of him and follow behind me,”Qin Yu said.

Wan ‘er nodded and said, “Thank you, Young Master Qin.”

Qin Yu did not say anything else and continued to move forward.

It had to be said that after AH SAN shut up, the surroundings became much quieter.

Qin Yu activated the desolate God’s eye and looked around vigilantly.

That mysterious creature could not be underestimated. Furthermore, no one knew how many were hidden here.

“Where did these things come from? It’s really strange,”Qin Yu muttered to himself.

Not only were they ugly, they also gave Qin Yu a very strange feeling.

That aura that was as calm as water did not seem like a living internal Qi.

Could it be that they were born from this internal Qi? Qin Yu thought to himself.

At this moment, the internal Qi was getting thicker and thicker.

Ah San, who was already injured, couldn’t take it anymore.

The two of them panted heavily, as if they were going to die at any moment.

“I can’t take it anymore, I can’t take it anymore...”Wan ‘er touched her chest, a hint of pain flashed across her pretty face.

Ah San also nodded and said, “I can’t take it anymore either...”

Qin Yu frowned and said, “If you really can’t take it anymore, just wait for me here.”

“Waiting for you here... is also not safe. It’s better to persevere,”AH San said.

Qin Yu nodded and immediately walked forward.

At this moment, under the desolate God’s eye, Qin Yu saw a trace of green internal Qi.
