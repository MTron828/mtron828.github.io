Chapter 1595: Chapter 1,595, crossing the Death River! 1 Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Both of them were staring at each other. Iron Egg had an extremely dark smile on his face, while Qin Yu was somewhat vigilant.

He quietly adjusted his internal Qi to the maximum, ready to make a move at any time.

At this moment, iron egg stretched his back.

He walked to Qin Yu, hooked his arm around Qin Yu’s neck, and said with a smile, “How are we going to split these Babe? Half each?”

Hearing this, Qin Yu finally let out a sigh of relief.

He rolled his eyes and said, “We’ll talk about it later. Why Don’t you throw your primordial spirit into the spatial magic artifact and pick it out yourself?”

Hearing this, iron egg immediately shivered.

He rolled his eyes and said, “I don’t want to go back to that place for the rest of my life.”

With Iron Egg’s help, the trip to the northern border would naturally be much easier.

Therefore, Qin Yu and iron egg left the ye family’s grotto-heaven, intending to go back to look for Qu Zhu and the others.

At this moment, at the northern border.

Xiao Hai stood on the other side of the Dead River, looking coldly at the other side.

These past few days, the other side had been terrifyingly quiet. No one had come to the northern border.

However, amidst this silence, there were occasional waves of strange movements.

These were the strange movements at the northern border. This strange movement made Xiao Hai increasingly uneasy.

“It’s time to set off,”Xiao Hai said in a low voice.

The monk of Hongxi said, “Even if you cross the river of death, do you have the confidence to defeat the Lord of the northern land? The environment there will definitely limit your strength.”

“Even if I can’t, I have to at least delay the time for him to recover,”Xiao Hai’s tone was firm and resolute.

The monk of Hongxi sighed slightly and said, “If you go this time, you won’t be able to come back...”

“Since I’ve made this decision, I’ve never thought of coming back alive.”Xiao Hai turned his head and looked at the monk.

The mask on his face began to fall off inch by inch, revealing his face with a bright smile.

“If I die, please build a tombstone for me.”

Xiao Hai picked up the fragment of the mask from the ground and handed it to the monk.

The monk of Hongxi put his palms together as if he was silently sending Xiao Hai off.

At this moment, Xiao Hai’s body was emitting an extremely powerful qi energy.

This Qi energy was many times stronger than the previous battle!

If one looked carefully, there seemed to be many divine dragons surrounding his body.

This was formed from an extremely powerful internal Qi. Its purpose was to resist the erosion of the body caused by the death river.

In the next second, Xiao Hai no longer hesitated. He slowly lifted his feet and stepped into the death river.

“Chi la!”

The moment he touched the death river, white smoke immediately rose from Xiao Hai’s feet!

His hands seemed to be corroded, and the pain was unbearable!

But what was shocking was that there was no change in Xiao Hai’s expression at all.

His rigid side profile could not help but move people.

As Xiao Hai’s body sank into the Dead River, the white gas became more and more obvious, like boiling water vapor.

Monk Hongxi put his palms together and said in a low voice, “Once a hero goes... he will never return. This move will definitely be recorded in the history of the Southern Province.”

Xiao Hai’s talent was extremely high. He was on par with the sect master of the Tianyun sect. As long as he wanted to, he could go to the Central Province to explore.

But in the end, Xiao Hai chose a different path, a path that was better even in death.

...

The northern lands.

The earth was trembling non-stop.

The three godly monarchs stood in front of the iceberg where the Northern Land’s master was sleeping, silently praying for the Northern Land’s master.

“Have you guys been to the Tianyun Sect?”Sima bei asked coldly.

“We have,”one of the godly monarchs said.

Sima bei sneered, “So one person died, right?”

The two godly monarchs did not speak, as if they knew that they were in the wrong.

Sima bei continued, “I did not expect that you could return after going to the Tianyun sect.”

“The sect master of the Tianyun sect is not on the Cultivation Mountain at all,”one of the godly monarchs said.

“His strength is beyond our imagination. I suspect that he has already stepped into the reversion void stage.”The other godly monarch also sighed slightly. “...”

Sima Bei’s expression was ice-cold as he said, “After the Lord recovers, we will take revenge for him and pay for your stupidity.”

As he spoke, the earth shook once again! And the ice mountain in front of them was shaking non-stop as a huge ice ball rolled down!

“According to this speed, the Lord should recover very soon.”One of the godly monarchs said.

“At least two months,”Sima bei speculated.

“Maybe we should speed up the progress,”the other godly king said in a deep voice.

The recovery of the Lord of the northern land required a large amount of energy. The source of this energy was the true qi and spiritual power in the body of the cultivator.

Over the years, the northern land had transferred an unknown amount of energy to their lord before he showed signs of recovery.

Now, it was finally the time for their lord to recover.

Right at this moment, the sound of “Shua Shua”came from the snowy ground, as if someone had come.

The three of them turned their heads in unison and looked not far away. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

They saw a person wearing a black robe walking over.

Sima Bei’s expression changed, and his tone was somewhat cold as he said, “Is this a place where you can come?”

The black robed man hurriedly said, “Lord Sima Bei, something has happened. Someone is crossing the Dead River!”

“Crossing the Dead River?”The three people’s expressions changed drastically when they heard this!

Everyone knew that the Dead River was impossible to cross!

“Hurry up and bring us there!”

The three people didn’t dare to think too much and rushed towards the border.

They arrived at the border and saw a person swimming in the Dead River.

The flesh on his body was almost completely corroded, but there was not a hint of pain on his face. There was only determination.

“Who is it? !”They frowned and looked at the person in the Dead River.

But when they saw this face clearly, their backs immediately turned cold!

This face could be said to be the nightmare of three people! Because they had experienced the terror of the Heavenly Cloud Sect’s sect master before!

“Tian... Heavenly Cloud Sect’s sect master!”Sima bei was the first to tremble!

The other two godly monarchs also turned pale with fright!

“He... how could he cross the Dead River? Could it be that he is here to take revenge!”

Sima bei flew into a rage and said, “I said that you are not allowed to go to the Heavenly Cloud sect, but you didn’t listen. Now, this god of plagues has been summoned!”

Towards the Heavenly Cloud Sect’s sect master, Sima Bei was terrified from the bottom of his heart!

“What’s there to be afraid of? He might not be able to successfully cross the Death River. Even if he was lucky enough to cross the Death River, he probably won’t be able to display 50% of his strength!”A godly monarch was the first to react!

“That’s right. In addition to the suppression of spiritual power in the northern lands, he might not even be able to display 30% of his strength!”Another godly monarch also came back to his senses!

“In such an environment, so what if he is the sect master of the Tianyun sect? He will have to suffer the consequences!”

“We can also take advantage of this opportunity to take revenge!”
