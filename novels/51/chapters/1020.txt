Chapter 1021: Chapter 1,021, are you even worthy

Three hundred top experts were ready to go back to Jingdu with Qin Yu!

This time, not only did Qin Yu want to flatten the Jingdu Martial Arts Association, he also wanted to flatten the second secret realm!

A group of people followed behind Qin Yu in an imposing manner and headed straight for Jingdu. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

They wore black robes. On the back of the black robes, two large words were written: Heaven Gate!

...

There were two martial saints in charge of the martial arts association in Jingdu.

Even though Gu Xinghe had been brought back, it did not mean that they had given up. They only planned to let things calm down for the time being.

In the secret realm.

Gu Xinghe’s face was filled with unwillingness.

His mind was filled with thoughts of how to kill his way back.

At this moment, Gu Zizhen walked in from outside the door.

When he saw Gu Zizhen, Gu Xinghe hurriedly stood up and said, “Dad, you want me to go back, i...”

“Shut up.”Gu Zizhen interrupted Gu Xinghe.

He said coldly, “Do you know what our priority is now?”

Gu Xinghe gritted his teeth and said, “Of course, we have to kill our way back!”

“Kill our way back my ass!”Gu Zizhen was instantly enraged.

“The reason I let you leave the second mystic realm was so that you could become a martial saint as soon as possible!”

“In the end? You wasted so much time on doing nothing!”

Gu Xinghe was instantly silenced.

He had long forgotten about the martial saint realm for such a long time.

“It’s impossible to enter the martial saint realm in a low-level secret area.”Gu Zizhen took a deep breath.

“Now, not only have you failed to enter the Martial Saint Realm, you’ve become infamous and even lost the right to show your face!”

Gu Xinghe was also a little flustered.

If he could not return to the current world, it meant that he would be stuck at the half-step martial Saint Realm Forever!

“Dad, you... If you want me to go back, I’ll definitely keep a low profile!”Gu Xinghe said anxiously.

Gu Zizhen said with a dark face, “Go back? You’ve already aroused public anger, how can you go back!”

“Then... then what should we do?”Gu Xinghe asked with some panic.

Gu Zizhen was silent for a moment and said coldly, “I’ve already applied to the higher-ups for you to go to the first secret area to cultivate. Don’t come back until you’ve become a martial saint.”

“The first secret area?”

Gu Xinghe’s eyes suddenly flashed with a glimmer of light!

After all, the higher-ups were in the first secret area! It was said that it was a real world!

“Pack up and get ready to leave,”gu Zizhen said coldly.

“Thank you, Dad!”Gu Xinghe said excitedly.

“I’ll come back to see you after I’ve become a martial saint!”

Gu Zizhen waved his hand and didn’t say anything else.

At this moment, the two of them didn’t realize that this farewell would be forever.

...

At the foot of the five mountains.

This was the place where the pilgrimage was held.

Not only did many emperors ascend this mountain, many who had mastered martial arts had also stopped here.

But today, the five mountains welcomed many martial artists.

These martial artists did not only come from the mystic realm, they also included a large number of contemporary martial artists.

“Why are there so many people today? The front seems to be sealed off.”

“I don’t know. I heard that a big shot has arrived here.”

Some tourists discussed in low voices with curious expressions.

Meanwhile, many martial artists were looking at the mountain peak with complicated expressions.

“Do you guys think that Qiao Zun can really step into the Martial Saint Realm?”Someone commented.

“If he steps into the martial saint realm, he will become the first young generation to step into the Martial Saint Realm.”

“That’s right. With Qiao Zun’s character, once he becomes a martial saint, he will definitely stir up a storm of blood.”

The disciples in the secret realm did not really care. After all, they were birds of a feather.

However, the disciples of the current generation were slightly worried.

This Qiao Zun was not a kind person. From the bottom of his heart, he looked down on the martial artists of the current era.

And when the disciples of the secret realm stepped into the current era, he was also the first person to stir up a conflict.

Just as everyone was discussing, the martial saint auspicious clouds flashed in the sky!

When they saw the large patch of auspicious clouds, many tourists could not help but reveal curious expressions.

“What a beautiful cloud!”

“It seems to have appeared several times this year! What kind of sign is this?”

“Is it the end of the world? Didn’t the experts predict it?”

The tourists who did not know what was going on took out their phones one after another to take pictures.

However, many martial artists had different thoughts in their minds.

“It’s over. This Qiao Zun is really going to become a martial saint.”

“If he becomes a martial saint, we won’t have the chance to stand out anymore...”

“I remember that Qiao Zun said before that once he becomes a martial saint, he will kill all the martial artists in the world. In other words, once he becomes a martial saint, he will not allow any martial artists in the world to become a martial saint...”

“The words of a martial saint... are too powerful.”

The auspicious clouds in the sky gradually dispersed and were replaced by dark clouds.

The dark clouds were brewing the heavenly tribulation and were about to pour down at any moment.

“Boom!”

Soon, the first heavenly tribulation descended like three thousand silver waterfalls.

“Judging from the scale of this heavenly tribulation, Qiao Zun’s strength is definitely not ordinary.”

“Of course. After all, he is a genius disciple.”

“I only hope that he can be struck to death by the heavenly tribulation...”

Heavenly Tribulation after heavenly tribulation rolled down, as if they were going to split this world apart.

But what was shocking was that even with such a scale of heavenly tribulation, the mountain of the five peaks was not damaged at all.

It was as if there was a faint formation protecting the entire mountain range.

The first one.

The second one.

In the blink of an eye, Qiao Zun had already welcomed the eighth heavenly tribulation.

The scale of Qiao Zun’s heavenly tribulation could not help but cause everyone to sigh.

“Such a scale is truly beyond our imagination,”someone said in a low voice.

“If he were to become a martial saint, I’m afraid he would be even more powerful than those old martial saints.”

Along with waves of deafening sounds, the heavenly tribulation ended.

The dark clouds in the sky slowly dispersed, revealing the blue sky and White Sun.

Everyone stared at the peak of the mountain, and their hearts were almost in their throats.

“Hahahahaha!”

Soon, a presumptuous laughter came from the peak of the mountain!

This voice contained inner strength, and it shook all directions!

Then, they saw a young man appear on the peak of the mountain.

He looked down at everyone and laughed crazily, “Today, I, Qiao Zun, have stepped into the martial saint realm. All of you must respect me! Those who disobey will be killed without mercy!”

The many martial artists below kept silent, but they felt extremely uneasy.

Qiao zun continued to say, “From today onwards, I will be reborn and become a saint. In a few days, I will dominate an area and encircle the land as a King! All of you, kneel down!”

As he spoke, a terrifying pressure spread rapidly!

The martial saint and Martial Marquis were an insurmountable chasm.

Under this pressure, many martial artists began to tremble and their legs could not help but tremble!

“Congratulations... Congratulations Young Master Qiao for stepping into the Martial Saint Realm!”Someone was the first to react and hurriedly shouted.

“Young Master Qiao is the first person of the younger generation to step into the martial saint realm. He is truly the number one genius!”

“What Yan Jinyao, Wan Gu Qiong, they are all just average people. From today onwards, the number one genius is only young master Qiao!”

“Hahahahaha, well said!”Qiao Zun could not help but laugh maniacally at everyone’s flattery. He had completely forgotten his form!

He swept his gaze across the crowd and said coldly, “Today, I will let all of you see how powerful I am after becoming a martial saint!”

Qiao Zun raised his hand and formed a seal with his mind. A rough red light that was like a mountain condensed on his palm.

Streams of killing Qi that were as thick as dark clouds struck everyone’s hearts.

That pressure seeped into their bones!

This was a true killing technique. Tens of thousands of streams of internal Qi condensed in his palm and finally evolved into the realm of mountains and seas!

“A true great creation technique!”Everyone’s hearts couldn’t help but tremble when they saw this!

“The number one person in the world lives up to his reputation!”

“Hahahaha!”Qiao Zun laughed maniacally.

“From today onwards, I will step into the Invincible Realm!”

But at this moment, not far away, a beam of golden light pierced through Qiao Zun’s killing technique like a rainbow piercing through the sun.

The golden light streaked across the sky and in the blink of an eye, it tore apart Qiao Zun’s technique!

The uneasiness that gathered in everyone’s hearts quickly disappeared.

Turning around, they saw a young man dressed in a black robe from the Heaven Gate stepping through the air and coming over!

“The number one person? Are you worthy of being called the number one person? However, how dare you spout nonsense here.”The young man’s voice was bone-chilling, but it was more filled with the dignity contained in his calm voice!
