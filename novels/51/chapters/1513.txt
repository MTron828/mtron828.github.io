Chapter 1514: Chapter 1,514, Declaration of war! 1

Man with the mustache’s expression became more and more serious as he looked at these items. He did not speak for a long time.

He picked up the weapons and materials inside and carefully observed them, as if he wanted to discover something from them.

However, after a while, man with the mustache said in a deep voice, “Even I can’t tell the origin of these things...”

“You can’t Tell?”Qin Yu couldn’t help but be a little surprised.

In fact, although Qin Yu always belittled man with the mustache, he still admired him from the bottom of his heart.

This kid looked muddle-headed, but he was extremely knowledgeable. There was almost nothing he didn’t understand.

Man with the mustache ignored Qin Yu. He raised his head and looked at the mausoleum in front of him, he said in a deep voice, “As expected, what the world sees is only the surface. It seems that the tombs that have been developed in this world should be visited.”

Man with the mustache put away the suitcase.

He looked at Qin Yu and said, “I can’t give you this thing for the time being. I have to study the origins of this tomb.”

Qin Yu Glared at man with the mustache and muttered, “F * ck your grandpa! Are you trying to run away with this thing?”

Man with the mustache rolled his eyes. “Am I lacking this little thing? You’re looking down on me too much.”

Qin Yu scratched his head. That was true.

Man with the mustache had countless treasures hidden on him. It was no exaggeration to say that if he were to take them out, it would be enough to shock half of the Holy Region.

......

“Then how are you going to find me?”Qin Yu asked, puzzled.

Man with the mustache said proudly, “I want to find you. There are many ways. Just Keep Your Heart in your heart.”

Qin Yu nodded and said, “Okay then. But... aren’t you being hunted? I heard that you didn’t even let the graves of the nine great families go.”

Man with the mustache couldn’t help but mutter, “D * mn, this is just a small matter. Everyone knows about it. They’re still too young to catch me.”

After saying this, man with the mustache patted Qin Yu’s shoulder and said, “Kid, you can’t tell anyone about what happened here.”

“Don’t worry, I’m not stupid.”Qin Yu rolled his eyes.

Man with the mustache grunted and didn’t say anything more. He turned around and was about to leave.

Qin Yu quickly pulled him back and asked tentatively, “By the way, is this tomb safe or not? Nothing can happen, right?”

Man with the mustache sneered and said, “Kid, you’re lucky. Even if something happens, you won’t die.”

Qin Yu wanted to say something else, but man with the mustache waved his hand impatiently and said, “Okay, stop talking nonsense. I’m very busy. I’m leaving.”

After saying this, the Mustache Man with the mustache jumped and disappeared without a trace.

This could not help but Shock Qin Yu greatly.

No wonder this kid was able to escape time and time again. His spatial spell was much more advanced than he Teng’s.

Damn, if I want to go to Zhongzhou, I’m afraid I’ll have to rely on this kid, Qin Yu thought to himself.

Then, he looked at the mausoleum in front of him.

Inside the mausoleum, dark energy was rampant and extremely dense.

Qin Yu took a deep breath and strode into the mausoleum.

After entering the mausoleum, Qin Yu didn’t dare to be too ostentatious, afraid that he might accidentally trigger some killing formation.

He carefully found a relatively safe place, and Qin Yu didn’t waste any time. He immediately sat down cross-legged and began to absorb the surrounding dark energy.

The moment the dark energy entered his body, Qin Yu felt extremely carefree. The feeling of being blocked for a long time disappeared without a trace, and the speed at which his body absorbed the dark energy was many times faster than spiritual energy.

As the dark energy entered his body, all the pores on Qin Yu’s body opened up, and he absorbed the surrounding dark energy as if he was hungry.

This was a long process, and Qin Yu’s body needed a lot of dark energy. Fortunately, the dark energy in the tomb was extremely dense, and it was enough to support Qin Yu’s cultivation.

At this moment, on the other side.

More and more actions were taking place in the northern lands. Under the urging of the northern lands, Yong Ji also began to prepare to attack the heavenly cloud sect.

In Yong Ji City.

Many Foster sons gathered together.

They knelt on one knee, like generals about to go on an expedition.

Yong Ji coldly swept his gaze over everyone and said, “All this while, I haven’t been able to see the best scenery in the southern region. All of this is because the heavenly cloud sect, this mountain, is blocking in front of me.”

“I’ve been patient for many years. This is the moment I’ve been waiting for. This battle, we can only win, we can not lose!”

His words made the foster sons extremely excited.

“Foster father, the sect leader of the Heavenly Cloud sect is still on the cultivation mountain. Will our operation this time...”the foster son’s words were extremely tactful, but his words seriously infuriated Yong Ji.

He looked coldly at the foster son. In the next second, he suddenly raised his finger and pointed it at the center of his brows.

In just a split second, that foster son’s primordial spirit had been directly obliterated!

Seeing this scene, everyone felt fear and trepidation!

“If anyone dares to say such words that are detrimental to morale, kill them without mercy!”Yong Ji said coldly.

It had to be said that his every action was extremely similar to that of a general on an expedition.

The hypocritical and amiable expression from before had disappeared. What replaced it was an indescribable dignity and dominance.

“The sect master of the Heavenly Cloud sect has long sealed off the cultivation mountain. He won’t come out until he breaks through,”Yong Ji said coldly.

“Moreover, so what if he comes out? I’m not afraid of him.”

Of course, these words were false. If he wasn’t afraid of the sect master of the Heavenly Cloud Sect, he wouldn’t have waited until now.

However, now was the time when morale was needed. Yong Ji naturally needed to say a few words to boost morale. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“Send a challenge to the heavenly cloud sect immediately. We’ll set off tomorrow,”Yong Ji said coldly.

“Yes!”

On the same day.

The news of Yong Ji City starting a war with the heavenly cloud sect spread throughout the entire southern province.

For a moment, everyone in the southern province was in an uproar.

“Eternal limit has waited for so long, but in the end, he still made his move.”

“I’ve Long said that this child is a wolf with wild ambitions. He has been conserving his strength for so many years for the sake of the heavenly cloud sect.”

“I have to say that this is a good opportunity for eternal limit. The Heavenly Cloud sect is being attacked from all sides. The northern lands, Eternal Limit City, and even Qin Yu. It’s really hard to say who will win and who will lose.”

“You guys think too little of it. Do you really think that the heavenly cloud sect only has these enemies? I don’t know how many sects secretly have a problem with the heavenly cloud sect. They just lack people to take the lead.”

“The southern region this year... isn’t peaceful.”

Heavenly Cloud sect.

In the meeting room, the deputy sect master’s expression was extremely ugly.

“He actually attacked the heavenly cloud sect at this time...”the deputy sect master couldn’t help but slap the table.

However, the elders on the table laughed coldly.

“You’ve sent people to the northern lands and all the major cities. The Heavenly Cloud sect is like an empty city now. Aren’t you giving others a chance?”Someone laughed coldly.

“That’s right. Why are you acting so lofty? You weren’t like this when the sect master was around. Do you really think that you’re the Savior?”
