Yong Ji hurriedly looked at the black-robed man and frowned, “Is what you said true? is the leader of the Tianyun sect really back?”

“I don’t know. It has to be verified. This news came from the Tianyun sect,”said the black-robed man.

“I’m planning to invite you to the Tianyun sect to see if the leader of the Tianyun sect is really back or if they are playing tricks!”said the black-robed man with a gloomy face.

Yong Ji’s expression instantly darkened.

He said with extreme displeasure, “Why the F * ck aren’t you going?”

The black-robed man was startled, then he explained, “Even if I go, it’s not worth the Tianyun sect master taking action...”

“F * ck you. What if he really came back? What would I do?”Yong Ji said while suppressing his anger.

The black-robed man frowned and said, “Even if he really came back, you can also return through the northern land’s teleportation formation. Furthermore...”

“Bullsh * T!”Yong Ji rudely interrupted him. He said with an excited expression, “If it was that simple, why would the godly king of the north die on the Cultivation Mountain? You want me to send myself to my death, right?”

The black-robed man was not stupid. He could tell that Yong Ji was clearly looking for an excuse out of fear.

“Mr. Yong Ji, don’t be agitated. I’m just saying.”The black-robed man explained.

“Am I agitated?”Yong Ji said with a ferocious expression.

The black-robed man opened his mouth, but was momentarily speechless.

Yong Ji forcefully suppressed the anger in his heart. He took a deep breath and said, “If he’s back, then this matter will really be troublesome...”

“Mr. Yong Ji, I really don’t understand. Is that Sky Cloud Sect’s sect master really that strong? Why are you all so nervous whenever he’s mentioned...”the black-robed man said softly.

Yong Ji glanced at the tombstone beside him and coldly said, “That’s a guy even scarier than Xiao Hai.” RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

The black-robed man immediately fell silent.

He had never seen how terrifying the Sky Cloud Sect’s sect master was, but he had personally witnessed how terrifying Xiao Hai was.

That was a person who had forcefully crossed the death river and caused the entire northern lands to suffer a loss in the northern lands’territory.

“Forget it for now. Let them live for a few more days.”Yong Ji took a deep breath and said coldly.

...

Everything went according to Di Zun’s expectations. After the news spread, Yong Ji and Feng Hai did not move.

It was as if they had disappeared from the northern lands. There was no news of them.

However, the other cultivators of the northern lands were still stirring up trouble in the southern region. They did not show any signs of restraint.

“This method of yours is really useful. I told you that you were smart!”An elder of the heavenly cloud sect patted Di Zun’s shoulder and said.

Di Zun smiled bitterly and could not help but mutter in a low voice, “Compared to that Kid, my method is nothing...”

The inspiration for this method came from a certain person.

That person was Qin Yu’s follower, Yao Qing.

“What should we do next? The northern lands will not let this go,”the deputy sect master said in a deep voice.

Di Zun shook his head and said, “I don’t know either. We can only take it one step at a time.”

Then, Di Zun sighed slightly in his heart.

“Master, you have to come back quickly...”Di zun muttered in a low voice.

...

Great Yue Mountain.

Qin Yu was sitting cross-legged here, absorbing the spirit Qi of the great Yue mountain.

Countless amounts of spirit Qi were irrigated within, and with the support of the great Yue fruit, Qin Yu’s cultivation speed was very fast. It seemed that the only thing he lacked was spirit qi.

As long as he had enough spirit Qi, Qin Yu would be able to smoothly break through.

In the blink of an eye, Qin Yu had been in closed-door cultivation for a total of thirteen days.

In these thirteen days, the outside world had long been turned upside down, but Qin Yu knew nothing about it.

He sensed the changes in the internal Qi in his body and tried to touch the intermediate stage of the Almighty Realm.

Unfortunately, although Qin Yu had absorbed a large amount of spiritual qi, he was still a distance away from the intermediate stage of the Almighty Realm.

He opened his eyes slightly and said in a low voice, “It seems like it’s just as I imagined. I still need the support of the dark energy this time.”

During this period of time, the effect of the spiritual Qi had become weaker and weaker. It was obvious that it had reached a saturated state.

Even if he used the meridian circulation technique, the effect was still extremely weak.

“It’s really troublesome,”Qin Yu muttered.

He stretched out a strand of divine sense and inserted it into the spatial magic artifact, trying to find items with dense dark energy from ye Nan’s inventory.

Unfortunately, Ye Nan, this dog, didn’t have any items related to dark energy.

“Fortunately, I was prepared,”Qin Yu thought to himself.

The last time he met the Mustache Man with the mustache, the dark energy in the tomb was extremely dense, enough to support Qin Yu to enter the middle stage of the Almighty Realm.

Therefore, Qin Yu stood up from the mountain.

He gazed at the tall mountain and said in a low voice, “It’s said that this used to be the former residence of a great cultivator at the tribulation stage. I wonder if there are any undiscovered treasures here.”

Although he thought so, Qin Yu didn’t have the intention to look for it. Instead, he stood up and left Mount Dayue, rushing toward the mausoleum from last time.

On the way, Qin Yu could clearly see the great battle between the northern and southern cultivators. One after another, the southern cultivators chose to self-detonate, forcing the northern cultivators back.

They fought with their lives on the line and chose to self-detonate at the moment of life and death. Such a suicidal counterattack shocked Qin Yu.

“There seem to be more and more cultivators in the northern lands.”Qin Yu frowned.

He didn’t think too much about it. After all, in Qin Yu’s opinion, with Qu Zhu and monk Hongxi around, the southern region shouldn’t be in chaos.

He rushed all the way to the vicinity of the mausoleum. The dark energy here was still bone-chilling, causing no signs of life in the surroundings.

Qin Yu didn’t waste any time. He stepped into the entrance of the mausoleum and sat down cross-legged. He began to absorb the dark energy here.

On the other side, ever since they heard that the sect leader of the Tianyun sect had returned, the sect leaders of all the major sects in the southern province rushed to the Tianyun sect.

They knelt on the ground and did not get up. They begged the sect leader of the Tianyun sect to help them.

In the hall, the deputy sect leader could not help but frown when he saw this scene.

“The sect leader is not here at all. How can we save them...”the deputy sect leader said in a low voice.

Di Zun gritted his teeth and said, “They don’t know anything anyway, so we’ll let them in for now.”

“What about after they come in? Who’s going to fight Yong Ji and Feng Hai?”The deputy sect leader glanced at Di Zun.

Di Zun shook his head and said, “I don’t know either. Let’s take it one step at a time.”

Thus, Di Zun welcomed all the sect leaders into the Tianyun sect.

“Where’s the sect leader? Please help me suppress the arrogant people of the northern lands!”

“The southern region has already fallen into chaos, why hasn’t the sect leader made a move?”

“Senior Xiao Hai died in battle in the northern lands. As Xiao Hai’s brother, why is he still unmoved? Could it be that he’s a coward? If that’s the case, we’ll leave immediately!”

Di Zun did not know what to do in the face of everyone’s attack.

“Everyone, shut up!”The deputy sect leader could not listen anymore. He shouted and interrupted everyone.
