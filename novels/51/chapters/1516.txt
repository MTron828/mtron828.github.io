Chapter 1517: Chapter 1,517, strength of the Sky Cloud Sect’s sect master 

When Yong Ji saw this, a cold smile appeared on his face.

He held the purple-gold pole in his hand and let out another explosive shout. Finally, the array completely collapsed!

The Sky Cloud sect was filled with a heavy atmosphere.

They looked at the deputy sect master as if they were waiting for his orders.

Even though they opposed the deputy sect master’s decision, they were still willing to die for the Sky Cloud sect.

“Everyone listen up. No one will be spared in the Heavenly Cloud Sect!”Yong Ji coldly ordered.

“Yes!”

The great battle was triggered at this moment. The deputy sect master shouted loudly and took the lead to charge into the battlefield!

This was an unprecedented great battle, a battle that no one could predict! The entire scene was filled with violent divine power. The sky seemed to change color under the light

Even if the main force of the Heavenly Cloud sect had been taken away, a sect that had been established for many years still had a foundation that was beyond imagination.

In an instant, a mysterious power emerged from the Heavenly Cloud sect. This power enveloped everyone, allowing everyone’s strength to be sublimated at this moment.

The earth was shaking, and the cultivation mountain would occasionally emit divine light.

Under this contrast, everyone in the Heavenly Cloud sect became incomparably Valiant!

......

The deputy sect leader had killed countless people, and in the end, he met Yongji.

In the outside world, countless people were watching. At the moment of the start of the battle, they had no way of determining who would win or lose. However, even now, they still had no way of determining.

This was because the heavenly cloud sect was too mysterious. Even the deputy sect leader did not know where this mysterious power came from!

The battle between the two sides lasted for three whole days, but no one knew for sure. This place had become the largest battlefield in the world!

While the Heavenly Cloud sect was fighting with the eternal limit city, Qin Yu, who was far away in the mausoleum, also felt a hint of a breakthrough.

Dark energy filled his body, making his body completely reach the balance of yin and yang.

Qin Yu suddenly opened his eyes, and an internal Qi rushed to his head!

His hair emitted waves of white mist, which was extremely mysterious and unfathomable.

“I finally feel the signs of a breakthrough.”Qin Yu was overjoyed! ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Fortunately, there weren’t any accidents like before. On the contrary, everything went extremely smoothly.

After stepping into the mighty realm, one naturally had to experience an unprecedented heavenly tribulation.

For a genius like Qin Yu, his heavenly tribulation would definitely be incomparably terrifying!

“Speaking of which, the battle between the Heavenly Cloud sect and the Eternal Limit City did provide the conditions for a breakthrough,”Qin Yu thought to himself.

Under such circumstances, Qin Yu didn’t have to worry about someone causing trouble in the dark during his breakthrough.

Even though that was the case, after thinking about it, Qin Yu still decided to find someone to protect him.

And the most suitable person was naturally zhuo jing.

In the entire South Province, besides Jue Wu, the only person with strength that was worthy of trust was Zhuo Jing.

Therefore, Qin Yu did not waste any time. He summoned the Divine Eagle and immediately rushed towards the Zhuo family.

His figure was soaring in the sky. Qin Yu sat cross-legged on it like an immortal.

After flying for an unknown period of time, Qin Yu felt a strange internal Qi.

“What a strong killing intent,”Qin Yu exclaimed.

He immediately activated the desolate divine eye and looked in the direction of the source of the killing intent.

With the enhancement of the desolate god eye, nothing could hide.

And the source of the killing intent was the Heavenly Cloud sect!

Looking at the scene in front of him, Qin Yu could not help but be shocked.

That place seemed to have turned into an ancient battlefield. Fresh blood had dyed the mountain gate red.

The Heavenly Cloud Sect, which was originally grand and imposing, had now turned into ruins.

Other than the Cultivation Mountain, everything else had turned into a mess!

The deputy sect master and the others were in a bloody battle. Even when facing Yong Ji, they were not at a disadvantage. They even forced Yong Ji to retreat!

“How could this be!”Qin Yu could not help but be greatly shocked!

One had to know that this deputy sect master had been forced back by Qu Zhu in a few rounds!

Now that he was facing Yong Ji, how could he be so Valiant?

Could it be that Yong Ji’s strength was not even comparable to Qu Zhu?

That was impossible! They were both figures standing at the peak of the southern state. Even if there was a gap, it was definitely not too big!

After thinking about it, there was only one possibility. That was that the Tianyun sect still had some mysterious hidden power.

With the support of this hidden power, everyone’s strength increased.

Qin Yu retracted his desolate divine eye and said in a low voice, “The Tianyun sect is indeed not as simple as I thought. Thankfully, I did not barge into the sect back then...”

If he had barged into the Tianyun sect’s sect, he would have died without a doubt!

Qin Yu sat on the Divine Eagle and could not help but fall into deep thought.

“Perhaps... I should lend Yongji a helping hand,”Qin Yu thought to himself.

This was his best chance, and it was very likely his only chance in the short term.

Thinking of this, Qin Yu sped up.

Only by stepping into the mighty realm could he get his hands on such a battlefield.

Several days later.

Qin Yu finally arrived at the Zhuo family.

The Zhuo family was still peaceful, as if they weren’t involved.

What made Qin Yu the most displeased was that Li Yingying was also there.

“This dog.”Qin Yu couldn’t help but curse in his heart.

Then, he ignored Li Yingying and walked straight towards Zhuo Jing.

“Brother Qin?”After seeing Qin Yu, Zhuo Jing was somewhat surprised. Then, he pulled Qin Yu to his seat.

“Brother Qin, the Eternal Limit City has already started a war with the heavenly cloud sect. The war has already sunk into a state of anxiety,”Zhuo Jing said with a smile.

Li Yingying, who was at the side, hurriedly interrupted, “Brother Qin, you are still the one with sharp eyes. You have long seen that the heavenly cloud sect is about to be destroyed.”

“I don’t think so. The eternal limit has brought all their forces to attack the Heavenly Cloud sect. It has already been several days, and there is no progress at all,”someone at the side added.

Qin Yu said with some curiosity, “When I came to the Zhuo family, I passed by the Heavenly Cloud Sect. I’m very curious why their combat strength is so strong.”

“It’s the alien divine light,”Zhuo Jing said.

Qin Yu looked at Zhuo Jing with some surprise and said, “What is the alien Divine Light?”

Zhuo Jing explained, “The Legacy Magic Treasure of the Heavenly Cloud sect can protect an area. Within the range of this magic treasure, the strength of the disciples of the Heavenly Cloud sect will soar.”

Speaking up to this point, Zhuo Jing smiled and said, “Back then, my father was fortunate enough to experience it.”

“What? Your father still has a grudge against the Heavenly Cloud Sect?”The people beside him were immediately greatly shocked.

Zhuo Jing shook his head and said, “A grudge is not considered. My father once fought with the sect master of the Heavenly Cloud Sect, and in the end, he failed.”

Once these words were said, everyone could not help but be greatly shocked! Qin Yu was no exception!

“Brother Zhuo, if I remember correctly, your father seems to be at the reversion void stage, right? That sect master of the Heavenly Cloud sect is actually at the reversion void stage?”Qin Yu said with a frown.

If that was the case, then the sect master of the Heavenly Cloud sect was probably the number one person in the southern region. There was no suspense at all!

Zhuo Jing said with a smile, “At that time, my father had yet to step into the reversion void stage, but he was only one step away.”

“And the sect master of the Heavenly Cloud sect relied on the alien divine light to defeat my father.”

Qin Yu did not say anything, but his heart was extremely shocked.

Zhuo Jing’s father had already died many years ago. At that time, the sect master of the Heavenly Cloud Sect was able to defeat a top-notch martial artist who was about to step into the reversion void stage. What about now?
