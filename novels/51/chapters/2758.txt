Chapter 2759: The Return

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Although Qin Yu had only spent a short time in the arena, an extremely long time had passed for him in Dream Realm.

This kind of cultivation that entered the dream had an extremely strong sense of reality. He had to hold it to preserve himself with the complete divine soul.

After Qin Yu split his soul, he completely fused with it.

Nearly twenty overlapping dreams made him wonder if he had a mental problem.

He had even forgotten why he was here and everything that had happened in Heavenly Sin.

This was the consequence of having a split soul. At this moment, Qin Yu could no longer even protect his intention.

“Qin Yu.”

A voice suddenly appeared in the Dream Realm.

Qin Yu? Who was this? What a familiar name!

Almost everyone in the 20 dreams looked confused.

Everyone tried hard to think, but they could not remember who this voice was.

“Qin Yu…”

After an unknown period, that voice appeared again.

It was as if the seed in the depths of her memory began to sway. A blurry image appeared in Qin Yu’s mind.

The figure began to piece together clearer and clearer in his chaotic memories.

Even though he was facing a chaotic dream, he still pieced together the most profound figure in his memory.

“This is not me!”

A strong will came and summoned Qin Yu’s soul.

“Ruoxue…”

At this moment, Qin Yu, who was in the fourth layer, regained a trace of light in his eyes. He looked at the woman who was smiling sweetly in front of him.

Qin Yu’s eyes were red, and tears could not help but flow down.

“I’m sorry, Ruoxue. I lost you again.”

“Didn’t you find me?”

Yan Ruoxue’s face was pale, but she couldn’t hide her joy.

She pushed Qin Yu to the ground and pressed her bright red lips against his.

“Ruoxue, why are you here?”

Yan Ruoxue didn’t let go of her lips until they couldn’t breathe.

“Qin Yu…”

Yan Ruoxue looked at Qin Yu with a smile. She placed her soft hand gently by Qin Yu’s mouth.

She slowly stood up. Her snow-white dress slipped down with a slight movement of her hand. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Qin Yu, are you willing to marry me?”

Yan Ruoxue’s eyes were filled with tears as she spoke to Qin Yu with a serious expression.

“I’m willing, Ruoxue.”

Qin Yu looked at her almost-perfect body with a confused expression.

He suddenly had a fear that this was just another dream.

When he woke up, everything was for nothing.

Before he could finish speaking, Qin Yu felt a warmth enter his body.

This was the moment he had dreamed of. Everything was going smoothly here.

Qin Yu hugged Yan Ruoxue tightly, afraid that everything would be for nothing.

A blood-red ‘four’ on the huge tombstone beside them was particularly eye-catching.

After an unknown period, Qin Yu fell into a deep sleep. This was perhaps the best sleep he had ever had since he stepped onto the path of cultivation.

The power of the curse mark appeared on his body and slowly protruded.

However, the strange thing was that this curse did not turn Qin Yu into nothingness. Instead, it dragged him up and sent him out of Heavenly Sin.

This time, Qin Yu felt he was in a deep sleep for the rest of his life.

Countless blurry memories came to him in his sleep, even though his divine soul had already returned to his true body.

However, the aftereffects of his split soul caused him to have many dreams that did not belong to him.

If it wasn’t for Ruoxue’s call, he might never have been able to return.

“Heavenly Sin?”

Lord Alester stared at the almost-perfect woman in front of her and subconsciously gripped her sword tightly.

Xiao Sheng, who was beside her, was surprised. He had seen Yan Ruoxue before.

However, the feeling Yan Ruoxue gave him now was the same as when he faced Heavenly Sin.

It was even more unfathomable. Every cell in his body was trembling.

She put Qin Yu down and gently kissed him before leaving.

“Keep an eye on him. When your cultivation realm rises, I’ll allow you to attack me again.”

Yan Ruoxue disappeared in the next moment.

“So she already knew about it and was just holding back. Perhaps we are just insignificant ants to her.”

Fatty Situ said with a bitter smile.

A gravestone curse appeared in the void at the side and Xiao Hai stepped out from it.

Previously, he had used the power of the Spacetime Hall to restore 40% of the power of the curse mark.

He became a part of the curse after his lifespan ended.

At the last moment, he took the risk of using 40% of the powers.

He kept Xiao Sheng, Fatty Situ, Lord Alester, and Cang Yunzi alive.

He thought that he had deceived everyone, but everything seemed ridiculous now.

Heavenly Sin’s power was not something that they could shake in their current cultivation realm.

“Perhaps our staying behind is related to Qin Yu. I didn’t expect Yan Ruoxue to be the target of Heavenly Sin this time. She has the strongest bloodline of Immortal Emperor Tianming. I’m afraid she will have to spend the rest of her life in endless atonement…”

Xiao Hai said with a bitter smile.

The power of Heavenly Sin’s curse mark not only allowed him to be reborn, but it also allowed him to awaken the sealed memories in the ghost realm. He could now recall everything from before.

“I wonder what kind of despair he will fall into after he wakes up…” Xiao Hai was silent. He was the person closest to Heavenly Sin’s power.

He could empathize with Heavenly Sin’s strength.

Lord Alester picked Qin Yu up, turned around, and left silently.

“Is this woman plotting something against Boss Qin Yu?”

Fatty Situ asked carefully.

“Don’t worry. Since Yan Ruoxue has chosen Lord Alester, she must have her reasons. What are your plans?”

Xiao Hai asked everyone.

“Originally, I had already entered the Five Declines of Celestial Beings and was about to end my lifespan. However, I just realized that my lifespan seemed to have returned to my youth. I’m about to begin my journey!”

Cang Yunzi laughed loudly. The Five Declines of Celestial Beings was a sign that the lifespan of a cultivator was exhausted.

Even an Immortal Emperor couldn’t avoid the fate of the Five Declines of Celestial Beings. However, he had gained a large amount of lifespan now. He didn’t understand why. Perhaps this was a reward from Heavenly Sin.

“Look, my Heavenly Umbrella seems to have changed as well. The Heavenly Sin curse mark has appeared on it. It has combined with the original runes of the Heavenly Umbrella. This thing is probably much more expensive now. I’m going back to my father to take a look.”

Fatty Situ was also surprised.

The Heavenly Umbrella was almost the end of the magical artifact.

He did not expect it to change again after experiencing the baptism of the power of the curse mark.

A magical artifact of this level would change drastically if it changed again.

“Xiao Sheng, what about you?”

Xiao Hai asked with a smile.

“The next time I see it, I will definitely become even stronger. And you, Xiao

Hai, we will have to fight.”

Xiao Sheng’s face was indifferent..
