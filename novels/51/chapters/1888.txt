1889 The Gu Family’s Saintess

Qin Yu nodded slightly. He had already thought of this.

They had a unique bloodline in them, and ordinary cultivators were not comparable to them.

“After a while, I should be leaving for Zhongzhou,” Qin Yu said to Dean Lei.

Dean Lei knew he couldn’t make Qin Yu stay, so he didn’t say much.

After leaving the first main peak, Qin Yu returned to Demon-slaying Peak. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

As soon as he returned, the peak master told Qin Yu that many people had come to Demon-slaying Peak to look for him, including Zhao Wan Er and various aristocratic families from Zhongzhou.

However, to Qin Yu’s surprise, no one except the Yao family from the nine great aristocratic families had come to look for him.

“It seems that my first place in the competition is not worth much to the nine great aristocratic families,” Qin Yu touched his chin and muttered.

Hearing Qin Yu’s words, the peak master couldn’t help but roll his eyes and say, “To most of the first-rate aristocratic families, you are indeed quite attractive. But to the nine great aristocratic families, you are nothing. At most, you are a decent rogue cultivator.”

“Why?” Qin Yu was puzzled and asked.

“The nine great aristocratic families don’t lack talents. Moreover, with their abilities, they even can cultivate a piece of trash into a top-notch cultivator,” the peak master said.

Qin Yu thought about it and felt it made sense.

After all, to these aristocratic families, the most important thing was their inheritance which had protected their families’ long-lasting prosperities.

There was about a month left before the three-year deadline. Qin Yu planned to go to Flower Peak to see Zhao Wan Er.

He then returned to his cave abode.

In the cave abode, Jue Wu was still in closed-door seclusion. The purple light on her body was getting even more intense, almost bursting the cave abode.

“This power seems a little strange,” Chang Mang said in a low voice.

“Why?” Qin Yu asked.

Chang Mang pointed at the mountain forest not far away. The mountain forest was covered with corpses, and countless wild beasts had turned into corpses.

“Did all these wild beasts die under this force?” Qin Yu asked in shock.

“Mmm,” Chang Mang responded. “Other than Jue Wu, no one else has entered this cave abode. Moreover, who would attack a group of wild beasts for no reason?”

Qin Yu didn’t say anything. He released his divine sense that fell on Jue Wu’s body.

Jue Wu’s internal qi was excessively tyrannical, and a powerful force filled her body.

It seems that it will take some time to refine the purple cloud pearl,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

“Are we going to wait for her?” Chang Mang asked.

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “If she still doesn’t come out of seclusion in a month, we’ll have to ask the dean to take care of her.”

“I think that’s the only way,” Chang Mang agreed.

Qin Yu spent the rest of the time comprehending the techniques.

As for the techniques left behind by his father, he could comprehend most of them directly without spending time.

In the last few days after leaving Thunder Courtyard, Qin Yu went to Flower Peak to visit Flower Granny.

He had wanted to bring Zhao Wan Er along, but unfortunately, Zhao Wan Er was Flower Granny’s personal disciple and would probably need to stay at Flower Peak to cultivate for a long time. Therefore, Qin Yu could only give up.

Qin Yu then said goodbye to the people of Demon-slaying Peak and Dean Lei and left Thunder Courtyard.

After three years, Qin Yu once again stepped into Nanzhou.

Even though Qin Yu was only in the Early-stage of the Reversion Void, he was no longer afraid of any young disciples in the world, including the descendants of the nine great aristocratic families.

“Where are we going now?” Chang Mang asked.

Qin Yu did not say anything. Of course, the person he wanted to see the most was Yan Ruoxue. However, Qin Yu could not find any reason to go to the Yan family now. He could only take it one step at a time.

“Let’s head to Zhongshou,” Qin Yu said to Chang Mang.

The two of them didn’t use any teleportation formation. Instead, they traveled through the continent of the Holy Region heading toward Zhongzhou on foot.

It was a long process but also a period of cultivation. The two sped all the way, passing through various cities in Holy Region, and headed straight for Zhongzhou.

“Based on our speed, I don’t know how long it will take to reach Holy Region,” Chang Mang said in a deep voice.

Qin Yu nodded slightly. He couldn’t help but sigh with emotion and say, “I wonder how the people who came to Holy Region with you are doing.”

“Yeah.” Chang Mang sighed.

Back then, dozens of people had come from the earth. Now, only Qin Yu and Chang Mang were able to gather.

“Speaking of which, I really want to get together with them.” Chang Mang looked a little distressed.

He had always been a sentimental person. After coming to Holy Region, he had no friends or family. He was naturally full of feelings for his hometown and old friends.

“I believe they’ll come to look for us when we’re famous,” Qin Yu said with a smile.

“Mmm,” Chang Mang responded. “We can only wait for that day.”

Holy Region was too vast. It was not easy to find someone on their own unless they had the same influence as the Yan family.

The two of them continued to move forward. They stopped for a while when they came to a city not far away from Holy Region.

The spiritual energy here was much denser, and it was easier to sense the Great Dao.

It was also due to this that Zhongzhou was so prosperous, and there were so many aristocratic families.

Qin Yu and Chang Mang came to a restaurant and sat down temporarily, planning to rest there.

“We’re not far from Zhongzhou now,” Chang Mang said.

“Mmm,” Qin Yu responded. Then he said, “In a few days, we’ll be able to enter Holy Region.”

...

“Do you have any plans after arriving at Zhongzhou?” Chang Mang asked.

Qin Yu didn’t say a word.

If it went according to his intentions, he would naturally want to enter the Yan family. Even if he had to become a craftsman, he would accept it. At the very least, he would have the chance to meet Yan Ruoxue.

However, it was not that easy to enter the Yan family.

“Let’s take it one step at a time. Let’s go to the Yan family to try our luck,” Qin Yu said with a smile.

Chang Mang didn’t say much. He asked for two jugs of wine, and the two ate and drank.

“Have you heard about it? The saintess of the Gu family has descended to Peaceful Land City recently. Rumor has it that she’s here for an inspection,” some people were discussing.

“The saintess of the Gu family? She’s a super beauty.”

“Yeah, rumor has it that she’s very likely to become the successor of the Gu family in the future. But… Why did she come to our Peaceful Land City? I don’t believe it’s just for inspection.”

“I heard it’s related to the strange changes in Peaceful Land City.”

Hearing their discussion, Qin Yu could not help but frown slightly.

...

Qin Yu had heard of the Gu family, one of the nine great aristocratic families. Gu Sanchen was from the Gu family, and Qin Yu owed him a favor, speaking of which.

“Rumor has it that the saintess of the Gu family was incredibly powerful. She’s not weaker than some of the senior cultivators. She’s been able to be on her own,” the people around them continued discussing.

“That’s right. The saintess of the Gu family should be one of the strongest among the young generation.”

“Rumble…”

Just as they were discussing, a series of muffled sounds suddenly rang out from nearby, following which the earth began to tremble.
