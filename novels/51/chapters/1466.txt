Chapter 1467: Chapter 1467, the people of the northern lands? 1

Ever since the incident last time, Jue Wu had almost become the first elder’s nightmare.

At this moment, when he saw Jue Wu, the first elder instinctively took two steps back. All the words he wanted to say were stuck in his throat, unable to say a single word.

He hurriedly put away his halberd, then turned around and left without saying anything.

Jue Wu snorted lightly, “What’s that? Showing off.”

Qin Yu looked at Jue Wu and said with a smile, “You came at the right time.”

Jue Wu rolled her eyes and said, “I told you not to go to the Heavenly Cloud sect, but you didn’t believe me. So what? Nothing was done, right?”

Qin Yu smiled bitterly and said, “I still have a trump card that is useless, otherwise...”

“Don’t say it!”Jue Wu used her small hand to block Qin Yu’s mouth.

She looked around and said, “No matter what kind of Babe you have, try not to expose it, understand? Otherwise, it will attract trouble, especially since the relationship between the northern lands and the southern region is so tense.”

Qin Yu nodded. It was precisely because of this reason that Qin Yu did not use the divine picture.

After all, it belonged to the masked woman. Even in the Holy Region, it would definitely make people envious.

“Oh right, do you know the theme of this banquet?”Qin Yu asked.

Jue Wu held her chin and muttered, “If I’m not wrong, it should be because of the matters of the northern lands. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have invited Xiao Hai.”

“Matters of the northern lands?”Qin Yu frowned slightly.

Could it be that the dispute between the north and the southern region had already developed to this stage?

“Is the north very scary?”Qin Yu looked at Jue Wu.

Jue Wu nodded slightly and said, “The north was originally a land of exile. Because of the cold weather and the lack of resources, the extremely evil people of the various continents were sent to the north.”

“After so many years, they began to branch out in the north and dominate the north. Therefore, most of the people there are extremely vicious.”

Qin Yu suddenly understood. No wonder it was difficult for people to survive in adversity. But once they matured, they would definitely be extremely terrifying.

Whether it was strength or temperament, they were all on par with ordinary people.

“Sigh, this Yongji really has nothing to do. The Heavenly Cloud sect didn’t even say anything, but he jumped out to take the lead,”Jue Wu muttered.

Qin Yu also nodded and said, “Yeah, could it be that Yongji wants to take the opportunity to weaken the Heavenly Cloud Sect’s strength?”

“It’s very possible!”Upon hearing this, Jue Wu’s eyes lit up, as if she had been enlightened.

“In any case, compared to the Heavenly Cloud sect, I hate Yongji more. The Heavenly Cloud sect is at least a real villain. Yongji is a hypocrite,”Jue Wu muttered softly.

Qin Yu covered Jue Wu’s mouth and said softly, “You can’t say such things carelessly. After all, this is Yongji City.”

“Who cares?”Jue Wu snorted.

More and more people arrived one after another. In the blink of an eye, more than a hundred people gathered in the immortal palace.

Qin Yu’s divine sense quickly covered Zhong Wu’s body.

Zhong Wu toasted among the crowd, looking like a villain who had achieved his goal.

“Why? Does that person have a grudge with you?”Jue Wu quickly felt the coldness from Qin Yu.

Qin Yu acknowledged and said, “He borrowed the hand of the Heavenly Cloud sect and killed the leader of the Hunter organization. He became the leader himself.”

“The leader of the Hunter organization has done me a favor. I have to kill him.”

Jue Wu wrinkled her nose and said, “I heard that he has a saint artifact in his hands. That thing is not a joke. Even I don’t dare to touch it.”

Qin Yu sighed and said, “If it weren’t for the saint’s artifact in his hand, I would have killed him long ago! I have to think of a way to trick that saint’s artifact.”

As he said that, someone walked in from outside.

He saw a handsome young man in long clothes walking in.

There was a smile on his face, but he looked a bit casual.

“Qu Zhu!”Upon seeing this young man, Jue Wu waved at him.

When Qu Zhu heard Jue Wu’s voice, he also walked over with a smile.

“Jue Wu, I heard that you just broke through not long ago. How Is It? Have you stepped into the reversion void stage?”Qu Zhu asked with a smile.

“Screw Your Grandpa. How can it be so easy to break through to the reversion void stage?”Jue Wu rolled his eyes.

Qu Zhu patted his own chest and said half-jokingly and half-seriously, “That’s good. I thought I was left behind by you again.”

With that, Qu Zhu’s gaze fell on Qin Yu.

“You are Qin Yu, right?”Qu Zhu smiled.

Qin Yu hurriedly cupped his hands and said, “Greetings, senior Qu Zhu.”

“Not really.”Qu Zhu shook his head. “You can just call me qu Zhu.”

Qin Yu smiled sheepishly. Although he said so, he couldn’t say it out loud.

A moment later, Baro and Feng Hai arrived. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

The three lunatics and three absolutes, except for the monks of Hongxi, had all arrived.

As for the legendary Xiao Hai, he didn’t show up for a long time.

Baro and Feng Hai seemed to be very familiar with each other. The two of them were inseparable. Although they didn’t talk much, one could see the fierce look on their faces at a glance.

Qin Yu said jokingly, “Aren’t you, Baro, and Feng Hai from the three maniacs? Why don’t they bring you to play with them?”

“Bah! We don’t know which idiot made up this nickname. His Grandpa is the Crazy One!”Jue Wu cursed loudly.

Qu Zhu, who was at the side, couldn’t help but burst into laughter.

“What are you laughing at? Why do you have to call yourself the three maniacs? I have to call myself the three maniacs. It’s not fair!”Jue Wu said angrily.

Qu Zhu joked, “It’s just an empty title. If you like it, feel free to take it.”

“I don’t want it. Tsk,”Jue Wu muttered.

There were already more than a hundred people present. Most of them were influential figures in the South Province.

Seeing that more and more people were coming, Yong Ji slowly stood up.

He swept his gaze over the crowd, cupped his hands and said, “Thank you all for coming to Yong Ji City for a gathering. I, Yong Ji, once again express my gratitude.”

“If you have something to say, just say it. Don’t be so pretentious,”Jue Wu said from below.

Yongji glanced at Jue Wu and smiled. “Jue Wu, you’re still in such a hurry.”

Then, Yongji looked at the crowd and said indifferently, “Since that’s the case, I’ll speak Frankly.”

After saying that, Yongji took a step back. The void in front of him trembled, and then, an old man with an ice-cold expression walked out of the Void Gate.

Seeing this person, everyone could not help but look at each other.

What a strange face. Why have they never seen it before?

“This is Dragon Bridge from the north, Mr. Long,”Yong Ji said.

“What? From the North?”

“Why would the people of the north appear in Yong Ji City?”

“They actually dare to show up openly in our Southern Province?”

“What does Yong Ji Mean?”

The crowd immediately exploded into a commotion, and everyone was discussing in low voices.

Jue Wu could not help but frown as she said in a low voice, “I guessed that it has something to do with the northern lands, but I didn’t expect that someone from the northern lands would actually come.”
