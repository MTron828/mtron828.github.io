Chapter 1651: Chapter 1,651: The Godly King is dead! 1 Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

The Godly King had already escaped. Qin Yu simply did not have the ability to make them stay.

This meant that for the northern land cultivators, a great battle was full of advantages.

Especially the battle with the Northern Land Lord three days later. If Qin Yu won, he could still escape.

It was fine if the young elementalists escaped, but what about the fully recovered elementalists?

The surrounding people were immersed in excitement, but Qin Yu quietly sighed.

The northern lands.

This place that was frozen in the cold had almost been emptied.

Everyone had gone to the southern region, so the northern lands appeared even more empty.

However, at this moment, there was a person sitting cross-legged, slowly recovering his internal Qi.

His condition was extremely poor. Not only did Qin Yu’s sword slash his mystic immortal palace, but it also injured his primordial spirit.

If he did not recover in time, it would probably affect him for the rest of his life.

Traces of internal Qi surrounded his body, looking somewhat mysterious.

“Damn it... how did this Qin Yu suddenly become so powerful...”the godly monarch said in a trembling voice.

Before he finished speaking, he spat out a mouthful of blood.

“If I had not escaped in time, I would have died in his hands...”the godly monarch took a deep breath.

At this moment, a sound suddenly came from outside.

Looking Up, it was actually Yong Ji and he teng!

The two of them returned in defeat. When they saw the godly monarch who was healing his injuries with his legs crossed, they were also somewhat surprised.

“Lord Godly monarch, you... What Happened to you?”Yong Ji said in surprise.

The godly monarch opened his eyes slightly and said coldly, “It was Qin Yu.”

The moment he said that, he teng and Yong Ji’s expressions turned unnatural.

They had always had a special feeling for Qin Yu. Now that they heard that Qin Yu was so powerful, they had an indescribable feeling in their hearts.

“This Qin Yu...”Yong Ji’s expression was extremely cold, and he could not help but clench his fists.

He Teng, who was by the side, was much calmer. His eyes rolled slightly, and no one knew what he was thinking.

“In that case, you lost to Qin Yu?”A moment later, he teng suddenly said. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

The godly monarch’s expression turned cold as he said coldly, “Get out.”

He teng snorted lightly, “You are a godly monarch, and I am also a godly monarch. Why should I listen to your orders?”

“You!”The godly monarch was instantly enraged! But because of the injuries on his body, he was unable to make a move.

“Let’s go out first,”Yong Ji said in a deep voice.

After saying this, Yong Ji turned around and was about to leave.

But at this moment, he teng pulled him back.

“What?”Yong Ji was at a loss.

A sinister smile appeared on he Teng’s face. As he walked towards the godly king, he said, “Haven’t you always wanted to be a godly king? Now is a good opportunity...”

“What do you mean?”Yong Ji was stunned.

And the godly monarch had a bad premonition.

He said with a cold face, “He teng, what do you want to Do!”

“Of course I want to kill you,”he teng said with a grin.

The godly monarch shouted, “Even if I’m very weak, it’s not that easy for you to kill me in the Northern Lands!”

Yong Ji remained silent, but he agreed with this idea.

This was because he had once sent his disciple to test the godly monarch, but in the end, he failed.

“Hahahahaha!”

He Teng could not help but laugh out loud.

He sneered, “I want you to die. No one can save you!”

With that said, he teng suddenly stretched out his hand, grabbing straight at the godly monarch’s head!

The godly monarch’s mind moved immediately, and an inexplicable power erupted, pressing straight at He Teng!

But he teng was not afraid at all. He waved his large hand, and directly took out the white bone staff!

The white bone staff suddenly swung out, smashing towards the sudden power!

“Boom!”

Under this strike, all the power dissipated into thin air!

“Go to hell!”

A vicious look flashed across he Teng’s face. His palm was like a claw, ruthlessly clawing towards the Godly Monarch’s head!

In the next second, his finger directly pierced into the divine king’s head, grabbing his primordial spirit out!

“You... Don’t do anything reckless!”The Divine King’s primordial spirit was frantically struggling in he Teng’s hand, incomparably terrified.

He Teng said sinisterly, “You conceited thing, it’s better for you to die. No one can surpass me, he teng!”

With that, he actually swallowed the primordial spirit of the godly monarch!

Everything happened in a flash. It was too fast. Even Yongji did not come back to his senses.

He Teng licked his lips. He patted Yongji’s chest and said, “From today onwards, you are the new godly monarch of the northern lands.”

Without waiting for Yongji’s reaction, he teng turned around and walked out.

Yongji looked at He Teng’s back with an indescribable fear in his heart.

This young man in front of him seemed to be even more vicious than him!

...

Teng Gate.

Yongji and he teng knelt in front of the elementalists and stated the fabricated facts.

“Qin Yu actually killed the Godly King! He was lucky enough to escape back to the northern lands, but in the end, he still died...”

He Teng’s voice was full of emotion. Even Yongji, who was at the side, was impressed.

The elementalist looked coldly at he teng who was kneeling on the ground. He extended his palm and an internal Qi grabbed he teng’s neck.

“What you said, is it true?”The elementalist asked coldly.

He teng hurriedly said, “It’s absolutely true! It’s a Lie!”

The elementalist narrowed his eyes and sneered, “If you dare to lie to me, do you know the consequences...”

After saying that, he threw he teng to the ground.

He Teng knelt on the ground without saying a word, like a stray dog.

However, this scene made Yongji feel terrified.

He could not help but recall what he teng had said in the north.

“You Arrogant Thing, you better go to Hell!”

These words lingered in Yongji’s ears, making him terrified.

“From today onwards, you are the new godly king of the northern lands.”At this moment, the elementalist pointed at Yongji.

Yongji was instantly overjoyed. He hurriedly bowed and said, “Thank you, Lord!”

The elementalist remained silent. He narrowed his eyes slightly and said in a low voice, “This Qin Yu... is really quite capable. In just two short days, our northern lands has already lost two godly kings...”

“Master, do you want to go to Qin Yu’s letter of Challenge?”He Teng asked tentatively.

The elementalist slowly stood up. He placed his hands behind his back and said indifferently, “Of course, I’ll go. Pass my orders. I’ll see you at Yingning Mountain in three days.”

“Yes!”

...

The news of the godly monarch’s death quickly spread.

Almost everyone knew that Qin Yu had beheaded a godly monarch of the northern region the moment he returned!

Such a battle result undoubtedly gave a stimulant to the lifeless southern region!

After learning of the news, Qin Yu could not help but be somewhat surprised.

“This godly monarch is actually dead?”Qin Yu rubbed his chin, feeling somewhat incredulous.

That sword strike should not be enough to kill him.

Qin Yu did not say a word, but he did not dwell on it.

Tianyun sect.

After the deputy sect master heard about this, he hurried to the cultivation mountain.
