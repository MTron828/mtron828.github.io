2191 Finding the Direction

Qin Yu stood in the void motionless and signed for a long time before looking at the surrounding starry sky.

Qin Yu’s figure floated in the depths of the void for an unknown duration, and he could not determine his position now. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

He looked at the surrounding starry sky and saw countless stars shining brilliantly. The starlight flickered in the universe like countless gems embellishing the dark background.

Nebulae floated in the universe, forming a dazzling array of colors. Red, blue, green, purple, and various other colors complemented each other, creating a beautiful universe painting scroll. The nebulae were like flowing ribbons, dancing leisurely like dancers in the universe.

The stars shone brightly, some bright and dazzling while some faintly flickering. They emitted their respective lights, illuminating the surrounding space with brightness and warmth. Some of the stars had already formed massive galaxies like groups of guardians guarding the order of the universe.

Between galaxies, interstellar dust existed. They drifted through the universe like tears of the Milky Way, flickering with faint radiance. They were pulled and guided by gravity and the forces of the universe, forming delicate bands of light that connected the entire universe.

In this vast and boundless starry sky, one could occasionally see meteors streaking across, instantly slashing through the night sky, leaving behind a bright trace as if it was the mark left behind by the stars in the universe. The appearance of the meteors fascinated people as if they had seen the mysteries and infinite possibilities of the universe.

At this moment, being in this vast and mysterious universe, Qin Yu could feel the boundless energy of the universe. The power of the universe surged around his body and fused with him. His soul was filled with the wisdom and insight of the universe as if he could comprehend the mysteries of the universe.

Qin Yu felt how small he was at this moment.

Probably because he had seen this vast and boundless starry sky or he had comprehended the dao technique from fighting with Wu Ji. In short, Qin Yu’s temperament became even calmer at this moment.

He turned around and looked at the crack in the void that had healed. He could not help but frown slightly.

“In the depths of the void, the warship has long since drifted to an unknown place.” Qin Yu sighed and could not help but shake his head.

Under such circumstances, Qin Yu could only transverse the void by himself.

Fortunately, Qin Yu had already stepped into the True Saint Realm. Thus it was not difficult for him to transverse the void. However, it consumed a lot of spiritual power, and he probably had to travel slowly.

“The coordinates of Earth are also gone.” Qin Yu frowned even more.

Without the coordinates, Qin Yu would probably have to wander in this starry sky.

Not only the coordinates of Earth were gone, but he also did not have the coordinates of the Holy Region.

In this frustrating situation, Qin Yu was completely unaware of time and had no idea how much time had passed. He was uncertain whether the supposedly hundred-year date had already expired or not.

“I can only take it one step at a time. At the very least, I have to find a life-bearing galaxy first,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

Thus Qin Yu stomped his feet, and he shot into the distance like a shooting star.

Having stepped into the True Saint Realm, Qin Yu had already reached a tremendously terrifying realm.

Not to mention an ordinary True Saint, even if he encountered someone like Si Liuhe, Qin Yu would not be afraid.

After creating his own dao technique and fusing it with Wu Ji’s, Qin Yu, in the current state in the True Saint Realm, could be considered a unique being.

His figure sped through the starry sky, leaving behind traces of light.

Qin Yu shuttled through the void at an incredible speed. The starry sky around him flashed past quickly like flowing ribbons. The scene in the void kept changing, and specks of light flickered around him like brilliant fireworks.

Qin Yu’s speed of traversing the void became increasingly faster, and the surrounding scene instantly became blurry.

It was a golden beam of light that had shuttled through the void for an unknown duration. Everything was no longer visible.

Qin Yu looked calm. His formidable physical body made him fearless in almost everything.

At the same time, his divine sense covered a large area of the star field, and he wanted to find a planet as soon as possible.

However, the universe was simply too vast. Even though Qin Yu was tremendously powerful now, the area his divine sense could cover was limited.

This kind of shuttling through the starry sky consumed a lot of energy. Before long, Qin Yu’s internal qi would be exhausted.

“Hmm?”

At this moment, Qin Yu’s divine sense captured a trace of internal qi.

Even though it was extremely weak, it could not escape Qin Yu’s detection.

“Finally, I’ve found it,” Qin Yu whispered to himself.

As long as he could find a star field, he would have a chance of returning to the Holy Region or Earth.

Qin Yu thus stomped his feet and swiftly dashed toward the internal qi.

As the wisps of internal qi drew nearer, a colossal appeared before Qin Yu within a few moments.

It was a tremendously massive warship like a moving castle in the void. Its surface was inlaid with shiny metal decorations, emitting lights as dazzling as a meteor streaking across the night sky.

“It’s a warship.” Qin Yu frowned.

This warship looked tremendously ancient, and the cultivators on the ship had unusual internal qi.

“It seems that people have started traversing the void to cultivate,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

In the Golden Age, countless chosen ones were unwilling to stay on their own planets. They tried to traverse the void to seek new dao techniques, just like the Astral Mountain in the Holy Region.

“Right now, I can only board this warship,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

Thus he stomped his feet and sped toward the warship.

However, just as Qin Yu approached the warship, it emitted a strange light, and the densely packed ancient talismans on the ship began to tremble slightly.

The warship was like a giant beast that could burst out with a powerful internal qi at any time!

“Who are you, sir? Why are you so close to my Yun family’s warship?”

At this moment, an elderly man in a long robe appeared on the deck of the warship.

The elderly man had a thin face with a long beard flowing down to his chest and white hair scattered like clouds.

There was a faint celestial aura between his brows, and his eyes were bright and spirited as if he could see through everything.

He was wearing a loose Daoist robe embroidered with golden cloud patterns, exuding a solemn and mysterious internal qi.

“Fortunately, it’s a human race cultivator,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

There were tens of thousands of races in the universe, and no one could guarantee cultivators of which race they would encounter.

Qin Yu thought for a while and then cupped his hands and said, “My family and I traversed the void in search of adventure, but unfortunately, our warship broke down, and we lost our direction. I wonder if you could give me a ride.”

Upon hearing this, the elderly man immediately frowned as if he was in a dilemma.
