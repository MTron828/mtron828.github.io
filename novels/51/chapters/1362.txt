Chapter 1363: Chapter 1,363, wrath of the Heavenly Cloud sect

Wen Wentong knew that the people from the Heavenly Cloud sect had arrived.

The white monkey and crow beside him also quickly stood up and looked up into the sky with solemn expressions.

As expected, a few figures appeared in the sky above the Wen family.

The leader was the sect master of the Heavenly Cloud Sect, and the first elder followed closely behind.

The sect master looked down coldly, the coldness and anger on his face could not be concealed.

Even though they were far away, they could still feel the bone-chilling coldness on his body.

Wen Wanji pretended not to know and walked out, quietly waiting for the arrival of the Heavenly Cloud sect.

Soon, the sect master brought everyone and slowly landed in front of them.

The sect master’s expression was extremely cold, but as the ruler of the southern region, he still displayed an extraordinary calmness.

“Where is he?”The sect master asked directly.

“Who is he?”Wen Wentong pretended to be dumb.

Before the sect master could speak, the first elder at the side scolded, “Wen Wentong, stop pretending! Where is Qin Yu? Hand him over!”

Wen Wentong said with slight surprise, “I don’t know either. I haven’t seen him. What Happened?” Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“Stop pretending!”The Great Elder took a step forward, full of arrogance.

Wen wentong sneered, “I haven’t pretended for a long time.”

“Qin Yu killed our sect master’s son. How dare you say you don’t know!”The Great Elder said angrily.

Wen Wanji said with a face full of shock, “Qin Yu killed our sect master’s son? How is this possible? Is there some misunderstanding?”

“Misunderstanding? So many people saw it with their own eyes. How can it be a misunderstanding!”The Great Elder said with a gloomy face.

Wen wanji frowned and said, “I really don’t know. Qin Yu didn’t come back either.”

“Besides, hasn’t the young master of the Heavenly Cloud sect not left the sect for a long time? How can Qin Yu go to the sect to kill people?”Wen Wanji said with a bit of sarcasm.

The sect master, who had been silent all this time, finally spoke.

He took a deep breath and said, “I will investigate how my son escaped. However, Qin Yu is the murderer. He must die. Wen wanyun, you can’t protect him.”

Wen wanyun said indifferently, “Qin Yu is not with me at all. It’s useless for you to find me.”

“You are his master. If I can’t find him, I’ll take you as an example,”the sect master of the Heavenly Cloud Sect said extremely unyieldingly.

Wen Wanji was not a weak person. He sneered and said, “Alright, then come and try it.”

The sect master glanced at the Crow and white monkey behind him as if he was warning them.

Then, the sect master gave an ultimatum, “I’ll give you three days. If you don’t hand over Qin Yu, I’ll definitely trample the Wen family.”

“I, Wen wanye, am not scared. I will wait for you.”Wen wanye coldly snorted.

The sect master did not stay any longer and turned around to leave.

The first elder coldly laughed, “Wen wanye, I have not liked you for a long time. Everyone says that your strength is extraordinary. Sooner or later, I will experience it.”

“Welcome.”Wen wanye faintly said.

They did not stay any longer and immediately left the Wen family.

After they left, a grave expression finally appeared on Wen Wanli’s face.

The white monkey and crow by the side were drenched in sweat.

They were also afraid of the Tianyun sect, especially one that was about to go crazy.

“Grandfather, why don’t we... Leave the South Province?”Wen Da suggested.

Wen Wanli shook his head and said, “I will never leave Da Yue.”

Then, Wen Wanli looked at the white monkey and the crow beside him and said, “If you two want to leave, it’s still not too late.”

“Screw you. Since we are here, we naturally won’t leave,”said the Crow.

“That’s right. Since ancient times, who doesn’t die? Not to mention that we might not die.”The white monkey also laughed.

Wen Wanli hummed in gratitude. He did not say much, but everything was said in silence.

Tianyun sect.

Elder Bai was sneering. There was no other reason than that he was the biggest beneficiary.

In this way, Tianyun sect would not push him out to take the blame.

“Playing with me? You are still too inexperienced.”Elder Bai sneered in his heart.

The news of Qin Yu killing the son of the sect master of Tianyun sect quickly spread throughout the entire southern province.

Tianyun sect also quickly issued a statement:

From today onwards, anyone who dared to have an affair with Qin Yu would be the heavenly cloud sect’s mortal enemy.

For a time, more than half of the southern province was in an uproar.

In just three short days, the news changed again and again, and it was all eye-popping news.

“It’s really strange. Just a day ago, it was reported that the relationship between the two had already eased up. Why did Qin Yu kill the son of the sect master of the Heavenly Cloud sect in the blink of an eye?”

“That’s right. I suspect that someone is intentionally doing bad things.”

“But no matter what, Qin Yu is indeed the murderer. He killed important figures of the heavenly cloud sect one after another. The Heavenly Cloud sect can not tolerate this any longer.”

“This time, I’m afraid that no one can protect Qin Yu, not even Wen Wanli.”

Countless comments swept through the entire southern province.

At this moment, Qin Yu was sitting in the mystic realm, feeling uneasy.

He had a bad premonition that he would implicate the entire Wen family because of him.

“No, I have to go out.”Qin Yu couldn’t hold it in any longer.

With his personality, he definitely couldn’t bear to let anyone take the blame for him.
