Chapter 682: Mask and Coffin! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

These black-robed men clearly didn’t know what kind of existence the masked woman was.

At this moment, besides the cold murderous aura on Xiao Yu’s body, they couldn’t feel any internal qi fluctuations.

Qin Yu stared in Xiao Yu’s direction, his heart filled with anticipation.

He wanted to know what kind of strength the masked woman had!

“Go!”

The three of them looked at each other, then took large strides towards Xiao Yu!

They held onto the Ice Spirit Needle in their hands. The three of them used all their trump cards at the same time to kill Xiao Yu in the shortest amount of time!

However, Xiao Yu didn’t move at all. She only looked at the three of them coldly!

“Swoosh!”

The three of them quickly arrived in front of Xiao Yu!

At this moment, Xiao Yu raised her palm slightly.

In an instant, the spells of these three people disappeared!

Not only that, but their bodies froze in mid-air and were unable to move!

“What... What’s going on?” The three of them were extremely terrified!

They struggled desperately to break free from this restriction. However, no matter how hard they struggled, they were still unable to move!

Xiao Yu looked at them coldly. She raised her jade-like hand and pinched forward lightly.

“Pu!”

As Xiao Yu closed her fingers, the bodies of these three people directly turned into a bloody mist and exploded!

The scene was filled with a strong bloody smell. Not even their bones were left!

Seeing this, Qin Yu couldn’t help but swallow hard.

What kind of strength was this? With a raise of her hand, she crushed the three of them?

Moreover, this wasn’t truely the masked woman. It was only the power brought about by the mask.

What kind of strength did the true masked woman have?

It was also at this moment that Qin Yu finally succeeded in breaking through.

He hurriedly stood up from the ground and looked in the direction of Xiao Yu.

“Xiao Yu!” Qin Yu shouted!

Xiao Yu turned around and looked at Qin Yu coldly.

Just a glance made Qin Yu’s heart beat faster, and the blood in his body seemed to be boiling!

The blood in Qin Yu’s body seemed to be expanding rapidly, as if it was going to explode at any moment!

“Xiao Yu, you...” Qin Yu opened his mouth and immediately spat out a mouthful of blood!

“Stop... I’m Qin Yu!” Qin Yu shouted with difficulty.

Facing this woman, Qin Yu didn’t even have the slightest intention of resisting!

Because he knew very well in his heart that no matter how he resisted, he was absolutely no match for her!

“Xiao Yu... I’m Qin Yu!” Qin Yu’s pores were already bleeding, and his bones were cracking!

He stared at Xiao Yu’s direction, his eyes filled with anxiety!

In mid-air, Xiao Yu looked at Qin Yu coldly.

“Xiao Yu, quickly... take off the mask. It’s okay now. I’ll help you...” Qin Yu used all his strength to say these words with difficulty.

Finally, Xiao Yu seemed to come back to her senses.

The pain that lingered in Qin Yu’s body also began to disappear.

Qin Yu fell to the ground with a thud and couldn’t help but gasp for breath.

“It was so close... just now... I almost died,” Qin Yu muttered in a low voice.

It was just that one look, and it almost took Qin Yu’s life!

This made Qin Yu sigh. What kind of cultivation base did she have to have such strength...

“As for the real masked woman... What kind of existence was she?” Qin Yu couldn’t help but feel speechless.

Xiao Yu’s figure slowly fell from the sky.

She looked at Qin Yu and then at Mr. Wu. A light suddenly flashed on the mask.

As the light faded, the mask on Xiao Yu’s face also slowly fell down.

Qin Yu hurriedly looked in the direction of Xiao Yu and looked at Xiao Yu’s pupils.

The coldness in her pupils had disappeared. Obviously, Xiao Yu had returned to normal.

“Qin Yu, save my dad...” Tears rolled out of Xiao Yu’s eyes.

She knelt in front of Mr. Wu with tears flowing down her face.

Qin Yu walked up to Mr. Wu. His expression was a little ugly, and he didn’t know how to comfort her.

With Mr. Wu’s current condition, it was impossible to save him. At least, with Qin Yu’s cultivation, he couldn’t do it.

“That masked woman can definitely do it!” At this moment, Qin Yu thought of something!

He hurriedly picked up the mask and handed it to Xiao Yu, saying, “Xiao Yu, put the mask on. Maybe there’s a way!”

At this moment, Xiao Yu was in a daze. Although she didn’t know why, she still hurriedly put the mask on her face.

Unfortunately, the mask fell off.

Xiao Yu didn’t turn back into the masked woman.

This made Qin Yu frown.

The masked woman clearly glanced at Mr. Wu just now. Why didn’t she save Mr. Wu?

Mr. Wu was her father!

Could it be that Xiao Yu and the masked woman weren’t the same person?

Or... The masked woman didn’t care about Mr. Wu’s life and death at all?

Xiao Yu knelt in front of Mr. Wu and kept sobbing.

The scenes of the past couldn’t help but appear in her mind.

“I should have been obedient... I shouldn’t have been so willful...” Xiao Yu hugged Mr. Wu’s corpse and wept.

Qin Yu didn’t know how to comfort her.

He put his hand on Xiao Yu’s shoulder and whispered, “I’ll help you get revenge...”

Qin Yu felt very sad after such a thing happened.

He didn’t have the mood to bring Xiao Yu to look for the man with the mustache anymore.

That night, Xiao Yu accompanied Mr. Wu’s corpse.

She kept recounting the past and repeatedly apologized to Mr. Wu.

But no matter what she said, it was unable to save Mr. Wu’s life.

The next morning, Qin Yu sighed slightly and said, “Set up a tombstone for Mr. Wu.”

At this moment, Xiao Yu raised her head.

She stared at Qin Yu and said, “Can you help me think of a way to protect my father’s body?”

Qin Yu was stunned. He was silent for a moment and said, “I have a friend. He might be able to do it.”

That friend naturally referred to the man with the mustache.

The man with the mustache had countless treasures, so it shouldn’t be difficult to protect a corpse.

Xiao Yu wiped her tears and said with some pleading, “Take me to see him. No matter what, you have to protect my father’s corpse...”

“Okay.” Qin Yu took a deep breath.

At this moment, Qin Yu suddenly thought of something.

“I might have another way,” Qin Yu said in a deep voice.

That way was the coffin in the Spatial Magic Artifact!

The coffin was extremely cold, so it shouldn’t be difficult to preserve a corpse.

Thinking of this, Qin Yu immediately took out the coffin. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

The blood-red coffin was placed in front of the two of them.

Qin Yu opened the coffin and said, “Put Mr. Wu into this coffin for now.”

However, at this time, Xiao Yu looked at the coffin with a dull expression and didn’t say a word.

There was a piece of clothing in the coffin. This clothing came from the masked woman.

Qin Yu couldn’t help but frown slightly.

Just as he was about to speak, the mask in Xiao Yu’s hand suddenly trembled violently!
