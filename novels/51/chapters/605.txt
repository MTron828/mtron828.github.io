Chapter 606: The Great Battle Against Yan Guiyi! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Qin Yu’s expression was ice-cold. His eyes glanced at the black ball in Yan Guiyi’s hand.

If his guess was correct, this black ball was definitely made of Black Gold Stone and had been specially refined.

This was one of the reasons why Qin Yu had always been afraid of Yan Guiyi.

As a member of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association, he had countless treasures on him. He was definitely not someone Qin Yu could compare to.

“Qin Yu, you have repeatedly ignored the rules. If I don’t punish you, how can I lead the team?” Yan Guiyi said coldly.

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and said, “Yan Guiyi, stop pretending. If I’m not mistaken, the purpose of this experiential learning is not only for the treasures, but also for another purpose.”

Yan Guiyi sneered. “So what if it is? So what it’s not? You are already here.”

Qin Yu’s internal qi was rising rapidly. He was ready for a big battle.

“Then let’s make our moves. No more nonsense,” Qin Yu said coldly

Yan Guiyi said indifferently, “Do you think I am the only one who wants to kill you? Let me tell you, there are many people who want to kill you.”

“That’s right.”

At this time, Yan Jinyao also stood out.

“Qin Yu indeed deserves to die.” Han Wei followed closely behind.

“A person who wants to challenge the hierarchy shouldn’t exist.” Kong Yun also stood out.

Zhuang Teng, Chu Hedao, Chu Heng, and the others were silent.

Yao Meng and Xiao Yuan, obviously not wanting to get involved in this matter, stood to the side very consciously.

“Qin Yu, do you see?” Yan Guiyi sneered.

“This is the sin you have committed. If you don’t die, the heavens won’t tolerate it!”

With a loud shout, several people walked towards Qin Yu at the same time! Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Qin Yu’s expression was ice-cold. He swept his gaze towards these people, and his eyes were filled with fighting spirit.

“Captain Yan, you guys have gone too far. Chang Mang is right. Our biggest mistake was to believe in the Jingdu Martial Arts Association.”

At this moment, many of the bottom-class martial artists also stood out in unison.

“Rights and benefits are earned by ourselves. They are definitely not given by others. If Qin Yu dies, I’m afraid we won’t be able to walk out of here,” the crowd said coldly.

Qin Yu glanced at them, and a trace of relief finally appeared on his face.

Fortunately, these people weren’t that numb. They finally knew that it was time to resist.

Yan Guiyi glanced at the crowd and said coldly, “Do you guys want to die?”

“Even if we don’t fight, we will die. If we fight, we might have a chance of survival,” someone coldly said.

“Hahaha! What a joke. You guys are just a bunch of ants. Who do you think you guys are?” Yan Jinyao narrowed his eyes and said.

The two sides had completely shed all pretenses of cordiality. A great battle was about to break out!

Qin Yu led many martial artists from the bottom level, while Yan Guiyi led the young masters from Jingdu’s upper class!

“We must not let them leave,” Yan Guiyi thought to himself coldly.

After this incident, these people had already stood on Qin Yu’s side.

Once they were let go, these people would become Qin Yu’s people! They would become members of the Green Moon Villa!

They were all extremely talented people, and with the involvement of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion, it was very likely that they would become formidable enemies of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association in the future!

Moreover, Qu Xie had given the order. Qin Yu had to die here no matter what!

“Then there’s no need to talk nonsense.” Yan Guiyi’s body flickered with light and slowly floated up.

Yan Jinyao and the others weren’t willing to be outdone. As prodigies, they were naturally extremely powerful.

Several streams of internal qi converged at this moment, and the air made sizzling sounds when they collided.

The entire Main Hall began to rumble, as if it was about to be unable to withstand this powerful force!

A great battle was about to break out. Golden light burst forth from Qin Yu’s body, and the Divine Dragon Power erupted!

His eyes swept across the crowd, and the battle intent in his eyes caused everyone to feel a chill!

“Qin Yu, you’ve been in the limelight for long enough. It’s time for you to die!” Yan Guiyi’s voice was filled with terrifying internal strength, and it shook everyone’s ears until they felt pain.

Qin Yu’s body suddenly shook, and he snorted coldly. “No more nonsense. Let’s do it!”

Qin Yu actually took the initiative to attack!

And his target was none other than Yan Guiyi!

Facing Qin Yu’s powerful physical body, Yan Guiyi didn’t dare to be negligent. He immediately activated the armor on his body, and a black-gold light rapidly erupted!

“Boom!”

The pure collision of bodies started this great battle!

Qin Yu’s hair flapped wildly, his eyes were sharp, and his confidence made him seem like an undefeatable war god!

The terrifying collision of bodies caused the Main Hall to rumble!

In the blink of an eye, the two of them exchanged dozens of punches! Each punch caused the space to rumble!

The more Qin Yu fought, the braver he became. With the support of the Divine Dragon Power, even when facing the Black Gold Stone, he wasn’t at all afraid!

Yan Guiyi’s expression turned cold, and he was filled with shock!

Qin Yu was probably the only person who could rival the Black Gold Stone’s toughness with just his physical body!

“Go to h*ll!”

Qin Yu let out an angry roar, then his fist drew an arc in the air and swung out fiercely!

“You really don’t know your place!” Yan Guiyi shouted loudly. The black gold light on his body shone to the extreme, and sharp thorns appeared on his fist!

These spikes were all made of Black Gold Stone and could be said to be indestructible!

The moment the two fists collided, the black spikes instantly pierced through Qin Yu’s fist!

However, the huge impact still caused Yan Guiyi to be pushed back repeatedly!

Everyone watched the battle without blinking, and their eyes were filled with shock.

They didn’t expect that even with the Black Gold Stone, Qin Yu could still be on par with Yan Guiyi!

Yan Guiyi shook his arm, and his expression became colder and colder.

He was in the middle stage of the Martial Marquis Realm, and there was a gap of several realms between them!

Not only that, but he also had the invincible Black Gold Stone, but even so, he still couldn’t take down Qin Yu in a short time!

“No wonder the higher-ups are so alarmed by him” Yan Guiyi said in a deep voice.

Yan Guiyi had only wanted to complete the mission when he tried to kill Qin Yu.

But now, Yan Guiyi was starting to feel a little scared.

He was afraid that such a person would rise up and that he would step into an invincible realm.

“D*mn you,” Yan Guiyi murmured with his eyes narrowed.

Qin Yu, on the other hand, didn’t say anything, as if he was casting some kind of spell.

A moment later, Qin Yu suddenly raised his head! His pupils flickered with light, and a golden light flashed in his mind!

“Divine judgment!”

Following Qin Yu’s loud roar, a golden light shot straight towards Yan Guiyi’s glabella!

“Oh no!” Yan Guiyi thought to himself. He wanted to dodge, but it was too late!

The golden light pierced straight into Yan Guiyi’s mind!

This was a spiritual attack. Although Yan Guiyi had the Black Gold Stone to protect his body, his divine sense was blank!

“Puchi!”

The golden light pierced into Yan Guiyi’s mind, and Yan Guiyi was stunned!

“Now!” Qin Yu seized this opportunity, and his hand began to move quickly!

A purple lotus flower condensed in Qin Yu’s palm!

With the appearance of the lotus flower, a terrifying pressure spread out.
