Chapter 708: Terrifying Fortune! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

In the current era, almost no martial saints were seen.

Even the extremely powerful Jingdu martial arts association had never seen a martial saint make a move.

Even a bodyguard with top-tier capital like Yan Sihai was only at the peak of the Martial Marquis Realm.

The next day.

Accompanied by Su Qian, Qin Yu toured more than half of Qing City.

“By the way, how long have you been a member of the Hong Yi Sect?” Walking on the street, Qin Yu suddenly asked.

Su Qian thought for a moment and said, “About three years.”

“Three years... that’s quite a long time.” Qin Yu nodded slightly.

“What’s wrong?” Su Qian asked.

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “Nothing.”

For some reason, Qin Yu felt that the Hong Yi Sect wasn’t very trustworthy.

However, Su Qian didn’t seem to be lying at all.

“What exactly is the Hong Yi Sect after?” Qin Yu had been thinking about this question for the entire day.

No matter how he thought about it, he felt that Hong Yi Sect was making a losing deal.

Even if it was like what Ning Kun said, which was because they admired Qin Yu, they wouldn’t throw out a stalk of 10,000-year-old herbs just because they admired him.

Qin Yu’s condition was deliberately making things difficult for the Hong Yi Sect.

If they really agreed, Qin Yu had no choice but to doubt the Hong Yi Sect’s intentions.

“Huh?”

At this moment, Qin Yu suddenly felt a strange feeling flow through his body.

Although this feeling was fleeting, it still couldn’t escape Qin Yu’s perception.

“What’s wrong?” Su Qian asked.

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “Nothing.”

At night, Qin Yu and Su Qian returned to the snack street and randomly found a tavern to eat.

Although with Qin Yu’s cultivation, he didn’t need to rely on food to survive, the delicacies in the world were really hard to resist.

After sitting down, Su Qian handed over the menu.

“Mr. Qin, take a look at what you want to eat,” Su Qian said politely.

Qin Yu waved his hand and said, “You can order. Just order a few of your signature dishes.”

Before he finished his sentence, that strange feeling appeared again.

This time, it was even more intense than the last time.

Qin Yu suddenly stood up. He frowned and looked around.

“Mr. Qin, what’s wrong?” Su Qian asked in confusion.

Qin Yu didn’t say anything. He looked around coldly and released his spiritual sense.

“What’s with this strange feeling?” Qin Yu frowned and asked.

Under the coverage of Qin Yu’s spiritual sense, no one could hide.

Soon, Qin Yu caught a figure.

“Hu Feng?” Qin Yu narrowed his eyes. With a shake of his feet, he disappeared into thin air.

In the next second, Qin Yu suddenly appeared in front of Hu Feng.

This action immediately gave Hu Feng a fright.

He trembled and said, “What... What are you doing? I didn’t do anything. Don’t do anything!”

Seeing Hu Feng’s nervous expression, Qin Yu was even more puzzled.

“What are you afraid of?” Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and asked.

A trace of panic flashed across Hu Feng’s face, and then he said in a low voice, “I. . . I’m not. Hurry up and get out of the way. I. . . I’m going home.”

After saying this, Hu Feng turned his head and left.

Looking at Hu Feng’s panicked footsteps, Qin Yu couldn’t help but smile coldly.

At this time, Hu Feng ran home desperately. From time to time, he would turn around to look, afraid that Qin Yu would catch up.

After running all the way to the villa at home, Hu Feng hurriedly walked towards a secret room.

This secret room was engraved with densely packed dao patterns, and the stone door had a strong sense of solemnity.

“Dad, how are you?” Hu Feng said anxiously.

Sect Master Hu’s voice came from inside.

He said coldly, “Don’t worry, it will take some time.”

Hu Feng gritted his teeth and said, “Dad, you have to speed up. I have a feeling that Qin Yu seems to have sensed something!”

“This kind of spell won’t be detected at all. I think you were scared out of your wits by him.” Sect Master Hu snorted coldly.

Hu Feng said with a vicious look, “Dad, I can’t wait to see Qin Yu kneel in front of me and beg for mercy!”

“Hehe, as long as I complete my spell and take away his great fortune, he will become a cripple,” Sect Master Hu said indifferently.

“At that time, killing him will be as easy as flipping a hand.”

Hu Feng hurriedly nodded and said, “Make him kneel in front of me and beg for mercy in front of everyone! Let him die without a burial ground!”

“What a vicious thought.”

At this moment, a cold voice came from behind him.

He turned around and saw Qin Yu standing at the door coldly.

“Qin... Qin Yu! Why are you here?” Hu Feng was so scared that he sat on the ground!

Qin Yu said coldly, “I saw that you had good talent and couldn’t bear to kill you, but you want to harm me?”

Hu Feng was already panicking. His lips trembled as he said in a trembling voice, “Don’t come over, or else... my father won’t spare you!”

Qin Yu didn’t say anything. He raised his finger, and a ray of light shot into the center of Hu Feng’s brows.

His divine sense instantly exploded!

Then, Qin Yu took out the golden core from Hu Feng’s body and stored it into the Spatial Magic Artifact.

“Sect Master Hu, the guest has come to your door. Do you want to close the door and refuse to see me?” Qin Yu said indifferently.

Sect Master Hu’s expression was extremely ugly inside. He could feel that Hu Feng’s internal qi had disappeared!

“Qin Yu, you actually killed my son. I won’t let you off!” Sect Master Hu said furiously.

“Wait until I seize your good fortune. I will definitely tear you into pieces!”

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and said coldly, “Seize my good fortune? That strange feeling just now... is it because of your spell?”

Then, Qin Yu patted the stone door and said coldly, “Open the door.”

Sect Master Hu ignored Qin Yu and sneered. “In your dreams! You killed my son. I must avenge him!”

Qin Yu didn’t bother to talk nonsense with Sect Master Hu. He clenched his fist and threw it at the stone door!

“Boom!”

The huge boom shook the entire villa!

However, the stone door didn’t move at all! Only a bit of dust fell!

“Hehe, it’s useless. This door is made of a special material and there is a spell placed on it. You won’t be able to open it!” Sect Master Hu sneered.

“Is that so?” Qin Yu squinted his eyes and a bright golden light burst out from his fist!

“I want to see how hard this door of yours is!”

Qin Yu held the golden light in his hand and threw a punch!

“Boom!”

With this punch, the stone gate was shattered into ruins!

Sect Master Hu’s expression changed, and he exclaimed, “How... how is this possible?” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Qin Yu ignored Sect Master Hu, and his eyes widened!

The scene in front of him was simply beyond Qin Yu’s imagination!

“This... is the fortune that was seized?!” Qin Yu couldn’t help but mutter in a low voice.
