Chapter 1163: Chapter 1,163, Gu Xinghe paid a visit to Tian Jizi 

This process might take a long time, because the process of the blood merging with Qin Yu was also constantly reshaping Qin Yu’s body!

Every time it was reshaped, it would bring with it an incomparably powerful strength!

At the same time, the more times it was reshaped, the more obvious the effect would be!

This might be a long process, but Yan Yongfu did not dare to Blink, afraid that he might miss something.

While Qin Yu was absorbing the blood, Gu Xinghe was also looking for Qin Yu in a hurry.

He used all his power to find Qin Yu.

However, Qin Yu had escaped into the internal Qi realm, so it was impossible for him to find Qin Yu with his aura.

“Instead of relying on these martial artists to find him, it’s better to rely on the power of the authorities,”Su Qi reminded him.

“It’s impossible for Qin Yu and Yan Yongfu to escape from the surveillance cameras.”

These words undoubtedly reminded Gu Xinghe. He hurriedly looked at Zhai Xing and said, “Quick, pass down my orders. Go and check the surveillance cameras!”

However, Zhai Xing shook his head and said, “There has long been no connection between the authorities and the martial arts association of Jingdu. They will definitely not help.”

Gu Xinghe’s expression became somewhat cold. He gritted his teeth and said, “I don’t care. If they don’t agree, don’t blame me for being impolite!”

“Young Master Gu, don’t act recklessly,”Zhai Xing said with a frown.

“If we really shed all pretenses of cordiality, no one will be able to gain an advantage.”

Although the Almighty realm was incomparably powerful, it did not mean that they could ignore real military power.

Once they fell out, both sides would suffer.

“I can’t care about that anymore!”Gu Xinghe roared angrily.

“At most, we’ll perish together!”

Zhai Xing glanced at Su Qi and said intentionally or unintentionally, “Aren’t you afraid that someone will take advantage of the situation? Do you want the Martial Arts Association of Jingdu, which you’ve been building with all your heart, to fall into the hands of others?”

This reminded Gu Xinghe.

He said with a gloomy face, “Then what should I do? Should I just let Qin Yu Go? Keeping him alive will become a disaster sooner or later!”

“I do have an idea,”Su Qi said faintly.

“Speak,”Gu Xinghe said hurriedly.

Su Qi said in a deep voice, “Go and find Tian Jizi. He will definitely be able to deduce Qin Yu’s position.”

“Tian Jizi?”Gu Xinghe was stunned. It was as if he had grabbed onto a life-saving straw. He hurriedly said, “Quick, bring me to Tian Jizi!”

Tian Jizi’s temple.

Tian Jizi, who was in seclusion, suddenly opened his eyes.

A trace of sadness flashed across his face, but he quickly regained his composure.

“We can’t escape this day after all,”Tian Jizi muttered softly.

The two disciples seemed to have realized something. They walked forward and asked worriedly, “Master, Can We... Pass this calamity?” VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Tian Jizi shook his head with a calm expression and said, “Everything is predestined. We live under the heavens, where should we escape to?”

When the disciples heard this, a trace of sorrow flashed across their faces.

The two knelt on the ground and said in a trembling voice, “Master, is there really no other way?”

Tian Jizi waved his hand. He smiled and looked at the two disciples beside him and said, “You guys can go.”

“No, we won’t go!”The two disciples were extremely stubborn.

“Even if we die, we have to stay by Master’s side!”

Tian Jizi opened his mouth. He seemed to realize that he could not change anything. In the end, he could only sigh.

To Tian Ji Zi, his life was extremely painful.

He could clearly see the future, but sadly, he could not change anything.

That deep sense of powerlessness tormented him for an entire lifetime.

...

That day, Su Qi brought Gu Xinghe to Tian Ji Zi’s residence.

The place was as calm as ever. However, the arrival of a helicopter broke the silence.

Gu Xinghe jumped down from a height of several hundred meters, then quickly walked towards the temple.

“Sir, my master doesn’t see any guests today,”one of Tian Jizi’s disciples said with a bow.

Gu Xinghe gave the disciple a cold glance, then raised his hand and slapped.

This palm was extremely powerful, directly turning the disciple into meat paste.

Zhai Xing, who was at the side, wanted to advise him, but he knew very well that he could not change Gu Xinghe.

The three of them stepped into the temple.

They saw Tian Jizi closing his eyes slightly, completely ignoring Gu Xinghe’s intentions.

Gu Xinghe sat directly opposite Tian Jizi and said indifferently, “I heard that you know everything. I came here today because I want you to help me find someone.”

Tian Jizi ignored him as if he didn’t hear anything.

Gu Xinghe frowned and said with a cold face, “Tian Jizi, if you help me today, I will definitely treat you as an honored guest.”

Tian Jizi said indifferently, “You are here to find Qin Yu, right?”

Gu Xinghe heard this and couldn’t help but sneer, “Tian Jizi really lives up to his reputation. What else do you know?”

“I also know that you’re trying to destroy the holy region, but I have to tell you that all of this is useless and futile,”Tian Jizi said slowly.

As soon as he said this, Gu Xinghe suddenly had the intention to kill.

He narrowed his eyes and said coldly, “No need to talk nonsense. Tell me where Qin Yu is.”

Tian Jizi opened his eyes and shook his head slightly, “Even if I tell you, you can’t kill him.”

“Nonsense!”Gu Xinghe was furious.

“Killing Qin Yu is like stepping on an ant!”

Tian Jizi looked at gu xinghe and said, “In your life, you’ve had countless opportunities to kill Qin Yu, but you’ve already missed them.”

“Now, you have no chance to kill him. I advise you to stop now. Maybe you can exchange for a chance of survival.”
