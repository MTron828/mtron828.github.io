Chapter 985: Chapter 985, Secrets of the Dao Protector

Qin Yu rolled his eyes and said, “It’s not that exaggerated. Fighting against a mighty figure? With just me?”

A mighty figure was a realm that was unreachable. That was an existence that possessed heavenly power.

The mustached man muttered, “It’s really hard to say. I saw it the other day. Your divine sense is much stronger than those of the same level.”

“With your special physique, it’s not impossible for you to become a martial saint and fight against a mighty figure in the future.”

Even tie Dan, who was in his mind, replied, “Yes, what he said makes sense.”

Hearing the words of the two of them, Qin Yu instantly looked forward to it even more.

He looked forward to the day he would become a martial saint. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

At this moment.

Qin Yu suddenly felt a strong murderous aura around him.

“HMM?”Qin Yu frowned.

This aura... was very similar to he Teng’s internal Qi!

“It’s definitely he teng,”Qin Yu said coldly.

Then, Qin Yu got up and was about to leave.

At this moment, Qin Yu’s phone rang.

He picked up the phone and saw that the caller was an unknown number.

Qin Yu didn’t have time to think. He walked out and picked up the phone.

“Don’t go out!”

As soon as he picked up the phone, a cold voice came from the other end.

This voice sounded familiar, as if he had heard it somewhere before.

“You Are... Zhai Xing?”Qin Yu said in surprise.

The other party didn’t answer this question. Instead, he said, “Don’t go out. Otherwise, you will definitely take the blame.”

After saying this, the other party directly hung up the phone.

Qin Yu’s expression was extremely cold.

“What’s Wrong?”The mustached man asked.

Qin Yu took a deep breath and said, “It’s a call from Zhai Xing. He asked me not to go out.”

“Zhai Xing?”A trace of surprise immediately appeared on the Mustached Man’s face.

Qin Yu sat on the bed, his expression extremely conflicted.

If he did not go out, others might suspect him.

But if he went out, he would be even more suspected.

He was caught in a dilemma.

“It really is the JINGDU martial arts association’s doing.”Qin Yu took a deep breath.

“It seems that I have underestimated this Gu Xinghe.”

He sat by the bed and hesitated for a long time. In the end, he turned around and walked out.

Since he would be suspected no matter what, he might as well try to catch he teng!

As soon as he stepped out of the door, Qin Yu saw he teng rushing out.

As usual, his entire body was wrapped in a black robe, and a sinister aura filled the entire street. Qin Yu’s internal Qi was extremely dense.

“Stop!”Qin Yu shouted.

He Teng stopped in his tracks. He opened his mouth and said in a low voice, “Qin Yu...”

“He Teng! You Can’t Leave Today!”Qin Yu’s internal Qi exploded as he shouted.

He Teng licked his lips and said, “Since I dared to come, I naturally have a way to escape...”

Qin Yu did not waste any more time with him. He immediately executed the line word incantation and arrived in front of He Teng in the blink of an eye!

He Teng’s pupils suddenly constricted! Clearly, he did not expect Qin Yu’s speed to be so fast!

“Bang!”

Before he teng could react, Qin Yu’s fist had already smashed into his chest!

This punch directly pierced through He Teng’s chest! Blood instantly gushed out!

“So Strong...”he teng grinned and said with a smile that was not a smile.

Qin Yu’s feet moved, and heavy falling space was instantly cast!

Then, Qin Yu raised his hand and threw the absolute beginning sacred fist at He Teng!

But at this moment, he Teng’s body turned into balls of black energy!

Qin Yu’s fist instantly missed!

The balls of black energy surged in different directions!

“Although I really want to fight with you, now... is not the time...”He Teng’s voice came from all directions.

“Don’t worry... I am about to become a martial saint. When that time comes, I will definitely kill you!”

After he teng left these words, he disappeared without a trace!

Qin Yu’s expression was extremely ugly.

“He escaped again...”Qin Yu took a deep breath.

“Before you become a martial saint, I’m afraid it will be very difficult to kill him,”the Mustache Man said in a deep voice.

“You must seal off the space in order to get rid of him.”

Qin Yu grunted in gratitude and said, “We shouldn’t stay here for long. Let’s go back.”

After he finished speaking, the two of them quickly turned around and returned to their residence.

That night, Qin Yu had a bad premonition in his heart.

He had gone out to look for he teng because it was a risk. If he could not catch he teng, his suspicion would multiply.

“Forget it, do whatever you want.”Qin Yu waved his hand impatiently.

Qin Yu could not be bothered to care about what others thought. Only strength belonged to him.

That night, Qin Yu closed his eyes slightly and tried to find the path to become a martial saint again.

However, for some unknown reason, he still felt that something was missing.

It was as if he was missing a trace of opportunity.

For half a night, Qin Yu was drenched in sweat, but he still could not find that trace of opportunity.

Qin Yu had no choice but to temporarily give up.

“You must not be impatient to become a martial saint,”tie Dan said in his mind.

“If you really can’t, you can go and beg your father. With his ability, it’s not difficult for him to let you become a martial saint.”

Qin Yu smiled bitterly and said, “I don’t even know where he is, how can I ask him?”

When he said this, Qin Yu asked curiously, “By the way, do you know what stage my father is in?”

“I don’t know.”Tie Dan shook his head and said.

“The strength of every guardian is a mystery.”

Qin Yu grunted and did not continue to ask.

His father had said that he would see him when he was strong enough.

Qin Yu lay on the bed, tossing and turning, unable to fall asleep.

At that moment, Qin Yu suddenly sat up from the bed.

“Tie Dan, let me ask you something,”Qin Yu said.

“... Don’t fucking call me tie Dan!”Tie Dan said angrily.

Qin Yu ignored him and continued to ask, “Do you know the Yan Family? and the bloodline of the Yan Family?”

Tie Dan was stunned and said in surprise, “Yan Family? Which Yan family are you talking about?”

“I don’t know either. Anyway... They all said that my girlfriend has an extremely powerful bloodline.”

After saying that, Qin Yu told tie Dan what had happened.

Including how the various secret realms and the martial arts association of Jingdu had snatched Yan Ruoxue away.

Hearing this, tie Dan couldn’t help but take a deep breath and murmured in a low voice, “According to you, I’m afraid there’s only that Yan family...”
