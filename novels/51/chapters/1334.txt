Chapter 1335: Chapter 1335, I don’t care who you are 

As expected, as the precious genius of the Tianyun sect, Ling Yun would definitely have some protective measures.

Looking at the old figure in front of him, Qin Yu narrowed her eyes and instantly saw that it was extraordinary.

This was definitely not an ordinary figure. It probably contained extremely powerful strength or had the ability to take Ling Yun Away!

The surrounding people couldn’t help but turn pale with fright.

The grand elder of the Tianyun sect was a truly important figure!

Even the Master of a city was far less than one percent of him!

“You actually lost.”The Grand Elder’s expression became even colder as he looked at Ling Yun who was lying on the ground.

His gaze quickly turned towards Qin Yu.

“You are that Qin Yu,”the Grand Elder said coldly.

Qin Yu cupped his hands and said, “Greetings, First Elder.”

The first elder snorted lightly and said, “How dare you. You injured an elder of My Tianyun sect, beheaded guardian Ren’s body, and now seriously injured my beloved disciple. What crime should you commit?”

Qin Yu was not in a hurry. He said politely, “First Elder, I don’t want to hurt them, nor do I want to offend the Tianyun sect. It’s just that you guys are forcing me so hard that I can’t live on. I had no choice but to resist.”

At this point, Qin Yu glanced at Ling Yun and continued, “As for Ling Yun, we fought fairly. I’ve issued a challenge before. With so many people watching, grand elder won’t interfere, right?”

Grand Elder frowned slightly. His gaze swept across the surroundings. As expected, there were many people watching.

“Of course I won’t interfere. Ling Yun’s loss is his loss. That’s because his skills are inferior to others,”grand elder said plainly.

Although he said that, he wanted to Slice Qin Yu into a thousand pieces in his heart!

If it weren’t for the fact that there were too many people present, he would have long taken action to get rid of Qin Yu!

“The first elder is indeed a sensible person,”Qin Yu said as she cupped her hands.

The first elder didn’t want to waste any more time with Qin Yu. He placed his hands behind his back and said quietly, “Since Ling Yun has already lost, there’s nothing more to say. As for you, I’ll remember you after you win against Ling Yun.”

Qin Yu smiled. “It’s my honor. Don’t worry, I’ll get someone to send Ling Yun back.”

After saying that, Qin Yu walked towards Ling Yun.

The great elder didn’t think too much about it. After all, there weren’t many people in the entire South Province who weren’t afraid of him.

However, what he didn’t expect was that Qin Yu, who was full of respect a second ago, had a cold expression on his face now.

He walked in front of Ling Yun and punched his right fist at Ling Yun’s Head!

Bam

Ling Yun, who had already lost his ability to resist, had his head and spiritual sense explode under this punch!

The Great Elder didn’t Expect Qin Yu to do this at all!

He stared at Qin Yu and was stunned for half a second before he regained his senses!

The people around him were even more dumbfounded.

Qin Yu killed his beloved disciple in front of the great elder? Was he provoking the heavenly cloud sect?

Wan ‘er covered her mouth as if she couldn’t believe everything.

As for Ah San, he was trembling in fear.

He had spent a few days with Qin Yu and thought that he understood Qin Yu. However, at this moment, he realized that Qin Yu was much more ruthless than he had imagined!

“You... are you courting death!”The Great Elder roared angrily. This roar shook the entire area and countless people around him exploded!

Qin Yu sneered. “Idiot, do you really think that I will let him off? Let me tell you, Ling Yun deserves to die. Since he dares to accept the challenge, he should be prepared to die!”

“Ah! ! !”

The first Elder’s roar exploded like thunder! The dark clouds in the sky dispersed at this moment!

“Little Bastard, I want you to die!”The first elder suddenly stretched out his hand and grabbed Qin Yu’s head!

However, Qin Yu was naturally not a person who was waiting to die. He clenched his right fist and actually intended to meet force with force!

“Clang!”

It was clearly a phantom, but it had substance!

The two hands collided, and a terrifying force exploded and swept out rapidly in all directions!

Qin Yu was forced back a few steps, and a crack appeared on his fist!

“As expected of the Heavenly Cloud Sect’s first elder. A phantom has such ability,”Qin Yu said coldly.

The shadow seemed to know that there was no chance to kill Qin Yu Now. It could only look at Qin Yu coldly and said ruthlessly, “From today onwards, the Heavenly Cloud sect wants your life.”

“Hasn’t the Heavenly Cloud sect always wanted my life? I’ll wait here. If you have the ability, then come,”Qin Yu said with a cold smile.

The Grand Elder didn’t say anything more. Whatever he said now was futile and seemed pale and powerless.

His shadow slowly dissipated until it disappeared without a trace.

Tianyun sect, the Great Elder’s residence.

The Great Elder, who had his eyes slightly closed, suddenly opened his eyes!

A wave of energy instantly emanated from his body! Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

The surrounding people were all dispersed!

“Great Elder, what... What Happened to you?”Someone crawled up and walked forward quickly.

The great elder clenched his teeth and clenched his fists tightly.

He suppressed his anger and said in a low voice, “Ling Yun is dead.”

“What? !”

Everyone was shocked!

Ling Yun... was dead?

“Who has the guts to kill a member of Our Heavenly Cloud Sect?”

“He is the number one person among the younger generation of our Heavenly Cloud sect! Even the sect master treats him like a treasure. Who Killed Him?”

The great elder narrowed his eyes and said through gritted teeth, “Qin Yu... I must kill you!”
