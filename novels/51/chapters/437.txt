Chapter 438: Luxurious Cruise Ship Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

This young man was the famous He Teng of the Central Plains?

The person who had always been ahead of him on the potential rankings?

“Mr. Qin, what’s wrong?” Fang Yue asked as if she didn’t already know the answer.

He Teng took the initiative to come forward and shake hands with Qin Yu. “Mr. Qin, I’ve heard a lot about you.”

“Likewise,” Qin Yu said in a flat tone.

He carefully sized up He Teng.

This person looked quite gentle, and there was no overbearing aura on his body.

At a glance, he looked elegant and graceful.

His internal qi was also concealed, so Qin Yu couldn’t see his true strength, even though he had such a powerful divine sense.

“Mr. Qin is a popular person on the Martial Arts Forum. I’ve always wanted to visit you, but I didn’t have the chance,” He Teng continued.

Qin Yu didn’t want to have too much to do with He Teng.

If a treasure really appeared on Brightheart Island, there would definitely be competition between the two of them.

“You’re too polite, Mr. He,” Qin Yu said indifferently.

He Teng bowed and said, “Mr. Qin, I won’t bother you anymore. I’ll see you on the boat.”

After saying this, He Teng turned around and walked toward the boat.

Fang Yue playfully blinked at Qin Yu.

Looking at He Teng’s back, Qin Yu didn’t see anything strange.

“What kind of strength does this person have? Why is he so famous?” Qin Yu frowned slightly.

Before looking at the potential rankings, Qin Yu had never heard of this person.

“Old Mister Yan, do you know the He family of the Central Plains?” Qin Yu asked.

“I’ve never heard of it.” Old Mister Yan shook his head.

Since Old Mister Yan had never heard of it, it was enough to prove that the He family was definitely not one of the top aristocratic families of the Central Plains.

Otherwise, there was no reason why Old Mister Yan wouldn’t know about it.

Just as Qin Yu was deep in thought, Li Zinan, who wasn’t far away, had already arrived with quick steps.

“Qin Yu, why are you everywhere?” Li Zinan brought the group of five in front of Qin Yu.

Qin Yu sized them up and said with a sneer, “I also want to ask you this question.”

Li Zinan said with a playful tone, “Qin Yu, the feeling of having your dantian crippled isn’t good, right? I heard that you have become a good-for-nothing now?”

“Actually, it’s quite good to be an ordinary person. At least you won’t be hunted down. Speaking of which, you still have to thank me,” Li Zinan said mockingly.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “I can consider your suggestion.”

Li Zinan obviously didn’t take these words to heart. He quickly shifted his gaze to Old Mister Yan.

“You, follow me,” Li Zinan said extremely tyrannically.

Old Mister Yan frowned and said coldly, “Do I know you?”

“You don’t need to know me. President Yan requests to see you,” Li Zinan said proudly with his arms crossed.

“As expected.” Qin Yu couldn’t help but frown.

Li Zinan was really sent by Yan Sihai.

“Are you talking about Yan Sihai?” Old Mister Yan’s expression was a bit ugly.

“Impudent! How can you call President Yan by his name?” Li Zinan scolded loudly.

Old Mister Yan’s expression became more and more ugly.

Of course, he knew what Yan Sihai’s goal was.

However, Old Mister Yan couldn’t figure out why the father and son had become enemies.

“Why? Do you want me to do it myself?” Li Zinan said coldly.

As he spoke, the people around him also quickly took a step forward, like they wanted to make a move.

At this moment, Qin Yu stood in front of Old Mister Yan.

“Where did you come from? Go back to where you came from,” Qin Yu said coldly.

Li Zinan said coldly, “Qin Yu, I’m not here to look for you today, but if you want to die, I can satisfy you.”

“You can come and try,” Qin Yu said coldly.

“Who else hasn’t boarded the ship? Quickly board the ship and get ready to set off!” At this moment, a shout suddenly came from behind.

Qin Yu glanced at Old Mister Yan and said, “You can board the ship first.”

“Okay, be careful,” Old Mister Yan said in a deep voice.

After saying that, he walked toward the ship.

Li Zinan wanted to chase after him, but Qin Yu was blocking his way.

“Qin Yu, don’t give yourself a hard time!” Li Zinan said coldly. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Qin Yu sneered and said, “Go back and tell Yan Sihai that a person must have a conscience.”

After saying this, Qin Yu turned around and walked toward the boat.

Li Zinan narrowed his eyes and snorted coldly. “You reckless thing.”

“Elder Li, what should we do now?” The people around him asked.

Li Zinan said coldly, “Get on the boat together.”

After saying that, Li Zinan strode towards the ship.

“Stop.”

However, just as they reached the entrance, they were stopped by an outstretched hand.

“This ship is full of important people. No one is allowed to enter without an invitation,” the staff in charge of ticket inspection said expressionlessly.

Li Zinan’s expression turned cold and he berated, “Do you want to die?”

“Oh.” The staff member nodded and then shouted to the side, “Someone is going to break into the cruise ship!”

A few policemen immediately ran over.

“Sir, don’t cause trouble.” The policeman looked coldly at Li Zinan and said.

Li Zinan frowned. He took a deep breath and said, “I’m from Jingdu’s Yan family.”

“It doesn’t matter who you are.” These people were just ordinary policemen. How would they know anything about the Yan family?

Li Zinan was angry, but he didn’t dare to flare up.

Although he was a peak Inner Strength Grandmaster, no one dared to openly challenge the authorities.

“Good, good.” Li Zinan gritted his teeth.

He looked at the cruise ship and said coldly, “I’ll wait here. I don’t believe you won’t come down!”

...

On the ship, Qin Yu came all the way to the deck.

Old Mister Yan was waiting there.

After seeing Qin Yu, Old Mister Yan couldn’t help but say coldly, “I didn’t expect Yan Sihai to target me.”

Qin Yu spread his hands and said, “Old Mister Yan, didn’t you say that only when the threat is big enough will it attract others’ attention?”

Hearing Qin Yu’s words, Old Mister Yan suddenly came to a realization.

“Old Mister Yan, you don’t have to worry too much. I will take care of those few people,” Qin Yu comforted him.

Old Mister Yan nodded and didn’t say anything else.

This cruise ship was extremely luxurious. There was everything on the ship.

Bars, restaurants, cinemas, libraries...

There were even small casinos, auction venues, and so on.

Such a luxurious scene really made Qin Yu sigh. Poverty limited his imagination.

The purpose of Old Mister Yan’s trip was to expand his connections, so he wouldn’t let go of this opportunity. He took the lead and headed to the banquet hall.

Qin Yu was afraid that Old Mister Yan would have any mishaps, so he could only follow closely behind.

He found a quiet place and sat down. A waiter beside him walked over with a wine plate.

Qin Yu casually took a glass of wine and slowly tasted it.

“Mr. Qin, you seem to be enjoying yourself.”

At this moment, Fang Yue and He Teng walked over from not far away and sat directly opposite Qin Yu.
