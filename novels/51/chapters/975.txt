Chapter 976: Chapter 976, Fight! 

Hearing Qin Yu’s words, tie dan said proudly, “If you lend me your body, I can deal with a few skeletons.”

Tie Dan paused and continued, “But... even if I kill those skeletons, I can’t stop this formation.”

Qin Yu couldn’t help but turn pale.

If he couldn’t stop this formation, then there would still be martial artists dying, and even he himself wouldn’t be able to escape.

“Bang!”

At this moment, another martial artist’s spiritual sense was pulled out, and his body fell to the ground.

“Ah!”

As more and more martial artists around him were pulled out of their spiritual senses, that panic continued to spread.

Qin Yu looked coldly at Tian Xuehong, who was not far away, and his face became more and more ashen.

But at this time, no one dared to stand out, because whoever stood out would become the next target.

Tian Xuehong stood there with his hands behind his back, quietly watching everything.

The expression of enjoyment on his face was even more thought-provoking.

“Qin Yu, we can’t wait any longer. Let’s fight it out with him!”Chang Mang clenched his fist and said.

His entire body was emitting a red light. Together with his tall body, he looked extremely oppressive.

“Saintly being?”At this moment, Tie Dan’s voice sounded again.

“There really are strange people gathering around you.”

Qin Yu ignored tie Dan.

He patted Chang Mang’s shoulder and shook his head. “Don’t do anything rash. Sit Down.”

Chang Mang gritted his teeth and said, “Don’t tell me we should just watch so many innocent people die? I Can’t Do That!”

“Fight it out with him,”Kong Yun said coldly.

Qin Yu fell into silence.

He thought for a moment and said, “Sit down. I’ll try to stop him.”

“We’ll go with you!”Chang Mang and Kong Yun said hurriedly.

Qin Yu hurriedly shook his head and said, “No. Since I dare to stand out, I naturally have a way to protect myself. Before I die, no one is allowed to go forward.”

After saying this, Qin Yu slowly stood up and walked towards the sky blood rainbow under everyone’s watchful eyes.

Almost everyone’s gaze was focused on Qin Yu.

The expressions on their faces were quite complicated. There was surprise, excitement, and excitement.

No one expected Qin Yu to stand out at this time.

“HMPH, showing off?”Yan Jinyao couldn’t help but snort when he saw this.

“You still dare to show off in such a situation. You are simply courting death.”

A trace of playfulness appeared on Tian Xuehong’s face.

“Qin Yu?”Tian Xuehong Sized Qin Yu up.

“I let you escape last time. I didn’t expect you to still dare to come out.”

Qin Yu walked towards Tian Xuehong step by step.

He looked at Tian xuehong coldly and said, “Tian Xuehong, stop.”

“Stop? hahahaha!”The Sky Blood Rainbow couldn’t help but laugh out loud.

“Do you have the right to say that to me?”The Sky Blood Rainbow’s eyes became extremely cold.

Qin Yu took a deep breath and said, “I’m trying to persuade you.” Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“What if I don’t Listen?”The Sky Blood Rainbow raised his eyebrows and said.

Qin Yu’s body suddenly shook, and golden light immediately lit up.

“If you don’t listen, then I can only fight to the death,”Qin Yu said coldly.

Hearing this, heavenly blood rainbow laughed so hard that tears almost flowed out.

“Fight to the death? You are courting death!”Heavenly Blood Rainbow said with a cold smile.

“Even picking stars is not worth mentioning, let alone you?”

Qin Yu didn’t say anything, but his internal Qi was still rising rapidly.

“Lend me your body...”Iron Egg’s voice sounded in his mind.

Qin Yu ignored him.

Qin Yu didn’t want to use Iron Egg’s power unless it was a critical moment.

First, he didn’t trust iron egg. Second, it was easy to develop dependence, which would affect his future cultivation.

“Okay, I’ll play with you.”

Sensing the killing intent from Qin Yu, Tian Xuehong also became interested.

He took a step back and with a slight wave of his finger, a white skeleton walked up to him.

Looking at the tall white skeleton in front of him, Qin Yu felt a little nervous.

However, other than being nervous, Qin Yu also had a strong desire to fight!

In almost an instant, Qin Yu’s internal Qi reached its peak!

That golden light was like the color of a hero, extremely dazzling and branded into everyone’s heart!

“Kill him,”Sky Blood Rainbow said coldly.

As Sky Blood Rainbow gave the order, white bones quickly raised its hand and reached out toward Qin Yu!

Qin Yu did not Dodge. Instead, he roared angrily and clenched his fist to meet it!

The Golden Fist seemed to be carrying flames as it fiercely collided with the sinister white bones.

“Boom!”

At the instant of the collision, sparks that were like steel clashing exploded!

Waves of power spread out rapidly in all directions like a shock wave!

Under this tremendous force, Qin Yu was knocked back repeatedly. It took him more than ten steps to stabilize his body!

“What a powerful force.”Seeing this, Qin Yu couldn’t help but frown.

The power of this white bone was even more powerful than he had imagined.

“Lend me your body, and I’ll teach him a lesson for you!”Iron Egg’s voice sounded again.

Qin Yu ignored him as he stood up from the ground.

The moment he stood up, he felt traces of pain coming from his internal organs.

“What a terrifying power.”Qin Yu couldn’t help but frown.

That power actually followed Qin Yu’s fist and spread throughout his entire body, causing an impact to his internal organs.

The body of a mighty figure truly lived up to its reputation.

“You don’t know whether to live or die.”When Sky Blood Rainbow saw this, he couldn’t help but sneer.

In the next second, that white bone charged towards Qin Yu once again!

Qin Yu still didn’t Dodge. He raised his hand and used the absolute beginning sacred fist!

The two of them clashed for the second time. This time, Qin Yu’s body was still sent flying, and he fiercely crashed into the wall at the edge!

His body slid off the wall, and traces of blood trickled out from his back.

“It’s even stronger than before...”Qin Yu couldn’t help but widen his eyes.

What kind of monster was this? Under the absolute beginning sacred fist, not only did it not suffer any damage, it did not even move a single step!

“Zhai Xing is really strong, to actually be able to smash this thing into the ground...”Qin Yu wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth, and could not help but sigh in his heart.

“Qin Yu, do you have a tendency to be abused?”Tian Xuehong said with a playful look.

Qin Yu did not say anything. He struggled to get up from the ground.

“I’m afraid I can’t hold back anymore,”Qin Yu muttered softly.

The only thing he could rely on now was to break ten thousand techniques with one punch.

Thereupon, golden light burst out from Qin Yu’s body once again. The rays of golden light were like a spring, pouring into his right arm.

In an instant, Qin Yu’s right fist became extremely hot, like a burning sun.

A terrifying power quickly filled the entire arena, and the entire discussion martial hall seemed to be heating up.

“What a hot temperature...”someone exclaimed.

“What Move Is This?”Yan Jinyao couldn’t help but frown, and he even stood up.
