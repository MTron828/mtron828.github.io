2506 The Vortex Dance

The blue energy surged and then stopped the internal organs from deteriorating.

Qin Yu’s body instantly emitted a layer of hazy greenish force. This force seemed to draw out from the depths of every cell.

This force instantly entered the Heart of the Ocean.

As the force entered, the Heart of the Ocean was like a blue sun, forcefully healing Qin Yu’s injuries again.

“Qin Yu, this Heart of the Ocean is extracting your life force. You must avoid such an extreme situation from happening to your body!”

Flower Granny was seriously anxious. She had a deep comprehension of the flow of time and life.

What the Heart of the Ocean had absorbed earlier was clearly Qin Yu’s life force!

Once lost, he could no longer replenish this force.

“Hahaha! I want to see how many times you can absorb life force! So you’re using your life force to fight me. I thought your progress was faster than my monster race’s Path of Heaven baptism!”

He Teng laughed wildly. Seeing Qin Yu suffer a loss, he felt great. And nothing else was important to him.

“You guys are courting death!”

“I’ve told you. Your opponent is me.”

Asura Godly King stared at Yan Ruoxue with an indifferent expression. He extended his hand, and boundless killing intent blasted toward Yan Ruoxue, making her unable to help Qin Yu.

Yan Ruoxue let out furious roars. Her hands were like dancing butterflies in the air.

In a breath, she formed thousands of hand seals.

In the sea of the Path of Heaven, a giant vortex appeared on the throne in the void.

The power of the origin surged wildly from tens of thousands of meters below the sea of space.

After surging into the throne, it poured onto Yan Ruoxue.

In an instant, as she swiped her index finger, an enormous transparent figure suddenly appeared behind her.

This figure was like a guardian giant as it suddenly started to spin.

“Divine technique, the Vortex Dance.”

It involved a combination of thousands of techniques and the use of the power of the Path of Heaven. Moreover, the power of the origin had to be refined to a very high level before it could be unleashed.

He could not use this move even now. He did not expect Yan Ruoxue, the abandoned child of the Yan family, to have mastered it.

Amid the giant’s movements, threads of black color eerily appeared in the air.

In the blink of an eye, Asura Godly King was struck by this black thread, and he instantly let out a furious roar.

These black threads were actually strands of spatial cracks.

The moment it struck his body, destructive power directly caused the space to collapse. Nearly half of his body had a massive wound that was so deep that his bones were exposed.

“You’re courting death!”

This injury was not considered severe to the Asura Godly King but made him feel extremely humiliated.

Judging from Yan Ruoxue’s power of origin, she was just a cultivator who had just advanced to the Tribulation Fifth Level. He did not expect to be injured by a sneak attack when caught off guard.

The terrifying killing intent instantly shattered the entire space.

However, it only hit an afterimage. The giant phantom behind Yan Ruoxue had already arrived behind He Teng at this point.

The Vortex Dance.

The spatial giant seemed to be waving its skirt, and then He Teng was suddenly sucked into the vortex.

In an instant, powerful spatial energy was released, and countless spatial fragments shot out in all directions like flying knives.

Countless living beings on the battlefield were suddenly cut in halves by this terrifying blade. They did not even know what had happened.

Under Yan Ruoxue’s control, the spatial blade avoided most of the humans.

The terrifying spatial storm raged like a tornado and slashed He Teng’s body with countless horrifying wounds.

Even someone as formidable as He Teng screamed in pain, too.

“Hiss!”

In an instant, most of the cultivators focusing on this side gasped and fell silent.

They did not expect Yan Ruoxue’s sudden attack to cause such impactful damage to the monster race’s number one Godly King.

“As expected of someone who can trigger the Nine Dragon Thunder Tribulation. She could use such a technique not long after entering the Tribulation Fifth Level. She can be considered the pearl of our human race!”

Su Xinghe could not help but praise.

Her body seemed to be on the verge of collapse as she stood in the air. Qin Yu quickly pulled her into his arms.

“Ruoxue, rest for a while. Leave the rest to me! You’ve been a great help this time!”

Yan Ruoxue nodded with a pale face. Her spiritual power was not as strong as Qin Yu’s Glazed Holy Body, which could last for such a long time.

After this all-out attack, she no longer had the strength to fight in the meantime.

Her body entered the Sumeru World, and the ring slowly slipped on Qin Yu’s index finger.

Qin Yu did not waste the good opportunity Yan Ruoxue had created. He suddenly appeared before He Teng.

The power of the second-level desolate divine eye landed on He Teng’s body again.

This time, He Teng’s injuries were even more severe. His demonic body was exposed before the world of Qin Yu’s desolate divine eye as it was recovering.

At this moment, when He Teng was severely injured, Qin Yu faintly sensed a burst of power.

It was a power that was completely different from the monster’s power and physique, and it was also not a monster race technique.

Qin Yu had collected the power of the Path of Heaven he obtained from the monster race’s sacrifices. However, that power did not have a crushing healing effect compared to the spiritual energy of the human race.

It could not be compared to the power of the Heart of the Ocean. However, He Teng had the recovery power of an almost immortal body.

In terms of the monster race physique, the monster race was born with a powerful physique and life force.

Their body structure and cells were often more formidable and durable than the human race, allowing them to repair damage faster.

This extraordinary constitution allowed the monster race to recover faster after being injured, and it was easier for them to withstand extreme cultivation and battle.

In some aspects, these two powers were very similar to some demon race with powerful bloodlines. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

For example, the Azure Dragon, Black Tortoise, Golden-Winged Roc, Nine-Headed Bird, and other powerful races all had powerful healing abilities.

Even if they suffered severe injuries, they could recover quickly as long as their origins were not affected.

This involved the body and bloodline power, and could not be changed.

However, He Teng’s power, which had been transformed by the Path of Heaven of the monster race, was even more formidable than this kind of recovery power.

It had reached an unimaginable level. Even Black Tortoise, a divine beast, could not recover as fast as He Teng.

In just a few breaths, he had already recovered nearly 60% of his combat strength.

Qin Yu could only buy a few seconds if he were to attack with all his might.
