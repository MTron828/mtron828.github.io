Chapter 956: Chapter 956, Prison Break!

This evil ghost instantly pounced on Qin Yu’s forehead!

Streams of black aura spread out from the evil ghost’s internal Qi.

The stinky smell made people feel extremely nauseous.

Qin Yu felt as if his spiritual sense was being stripped away, and it was extremely painful!

“Damn it...”Qin Yu clenched his fists and forcefully stabilized his spiritual sense to prevent it from being pulled out of his body.

Qin Yu’s spiritual sense seemed to have formed a confrontation with the power of this evil ghost!

Not far away, Tian Xuehong couldn’t help but be surprised when he saw this.

“You can actually resist the three paths of evil ghosts? Interesting,”Tian Xuehong said with a cold smile.

“If you can resist one, then what about two or three?”

With that, he waved his hand, and two more evil ghosts pounced at Qin Yu!

The moment they pounced, that power instantly skyrocketed!

Qin Yu’s divine sense was instantly drawn out by more than half!

This kind of pain caused Qin Yu’s entire body to tremble uncontrollably!

“Ah! !”Qin Yu raised his head and roared angrily. He firmly controlled his divine sense, afraid of being pulled out of his body!

However, the power of these three evil spirits was simply too powerful. In addition, Qin Yu’s body was extremely weak. Even if he tried his best to block them, his divine sense was still being drawn out bit by bit!

“It’s over...”beads of sweat appeared on Qin Yu’s forehead. He was already powerless to resist.

Just as Qin Yu was about to give up, a loud bang suddenly came from outside!

“Boom!”

With a loud bang, the prison’s door was actually smashed open!

Looking over, one could only see several people standing at the door!

And the person leading them was none other than Chang Mang!

At this moment, his entire body was boiling red, and his aura was burning. He looked like a God!

Following behind him were Zhuang Teng, Yao Meng, and the others!

“HM?”When Gu Xinghe saw this scene, he could not help but frown slightly.

“Are you guys crazy? How dare you barge into the Jingdu Martial Arts Association’s Prison? Do you know what kind of crime this is?”Gu Xinghe said with a gloomy face.

“F * ck you!”Chang Mang shouted loudly, and then his steel-like body crashed toward Gu Xinghe!

Gu Xinghe did not dare to be negligent, and hurriedly raised his hand to respond.

However, as a saintly being, Chang Mang had immense strength. The moment they collided, he was directly sent flying!

“You guys quickly go and save them, I’ll hold them off,”Chang Mang said coldly.

Zhuang Teng and the others nodded slightly. Then, they quickly rushed toward Qin Yu.

Due to the sudden situation, Tian Xuehong had no choice but to stop what he was doing. He turned around and looked at these people coldly.

“Tian Xuehong? You’re here too!”Kong Yun couldn’t help but Shout!

“Gu Xinghe, are you shameless? How dare you collude with Tian Xuehong!”

Gu Xinghe’s expression turned even colder. He swept his gaze across the crowd and said gloomily, “Are all of you trying to rebel?”

“Cut the crap, take a punch from Me First!”Chang Mang roared angrily and his iron fist instantly smashed towards Gu Xinghe!

Chang Mang’s strength was unparalleled. Even Qin Yu did not dare to underestimate him, let alone Gu Xinghe!

Under his attack, Gu Xinghe and Tian Xuehong could only deal with him.

Taking advantage of this time, Zhuang Teng and Yao Meng quickly approached Qin Yu.

Qin Yu’s spiritual sense returned to his body, but the intense pain still made his forehead break out in cold sweat, and his body felt a little weak.

“This prison is extremely hard, you can’t open it...”Qin Yu said in a low voice.

Zhuang Teng’s body shook, and he took out a dark long sword.

“This is a divine sword passed down in our family. It is said to be able to cut through everything. Don’t worry, we have made full preparations,”Zhuang Teng said.

After he said that, he waved his hand and directly slashed towards the prison!

“Buzz!”

With a burst of light, the prison’s bars were instantly cut off!

It was so sharp that even Qin Yu was shocked!

“Don’t waste time. When their people arrive, we won’t be able to leave,”Yao Meng said.

After saying that, Zhuang Teng quickly walked in and pulled Qin Yu along, preparing to leave.

At this moment, Chang Mang was still immersed in a bloody battle. Facing the two of them, he also appeared to be extremely exhausted. Bloody Holes appeared one after another all over his body.

Looking at Chang Mang who was desperately fighting, Qin Yu suddenly felt a little unbearable.

“Get lost quickly! Leave Chang Mang to me,”Kong Yun said with a frown.

Qin Yu was speechless. He couldn’t help but feel touched.

He never thought that these people would come to save him on their own accord!

“Thank you,”Qin Yu said sincerely.

“Stop talking nonsense and leave now!”Kong Yun shouted.

Qin Yu didn’t say anything more. Under the cover of them, he walked toward the door.

When he reached the door, Qin Yu suddenly stopped.

“Zhuang Teng, lend me your sword,”Qin Yu said in a low voice.

Zhuang teng frowned and asked, “What do you want to Do?”

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “Quick, there’s no time.”

Seeing this, Zhuang Teng did not say anything more and immediately handed the sword in his hand to Qin Yu.

Qin Yu took the divine sword. He forcefully activated the internal Qi in his body and injected the remaining spiritual energy into the divine sword.

Then, Qin Yu swept his gaze toward the prison.

His pupils constricted, and with a furious roar, Qin Yu swung the divine sword in his hand forward!

“Buzz!”

A burst of light swept across! The terrifying internal Qi was like a surging sea, shocking everyone!

“Not good!”Gu Xinghe and Tian Xuehong hurriedly dodged to the side!

However, they didn’t expect that the target of this sword was not them, but the prisoner!

The sword slashed across the prison, and all the bars were sliced flat!

“This is all I can do. You guys... Hurry up and escape...”Qin Yu looked at the prisoners and said with his last breath.

After saying this, Qin Yu’s vision went black, and he directly fainted.

Many annoying people instantly swarmed over. They, who were already full of resentment, were now even more furious!

Facing so many angry prisoners, Tian Xuehong and Gu Xinghe could only avoid their sharp edges! Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

“Everyone, retreat quickly!”Chang Mang and Kong Yun shouted.

The two of them covered the prisoners and retreated out of the door.

Gu Xinghe shouted, “Zhai Xing, Zhai Xing!”

But after he shouted, he remembered that Zhai Xing and the two martial saints beside him had been sent out!

“Damn it!”Gu Xinghe was instantly furious!

Tian Xuehong’s expression was also somewhat unsightly.

He coldly swept his gaze over the many prisoners who had escaped and muttered in a low voice, “They actually escaped...”

Gu Xinghe took a deep breath and coldly said, “They dared to come to the Jingdu Martial Arts Association to break out of prison. I was just worried that I wouldn’t have an excuse to deal with them...”

With that, he swept his gaze to the door and shouted, “Go, Get Zhai Xing back immediately!”
