2137 The Domineering Xiao Sheng

Upon seeing the words, Qin Yu quickly raised his head to look at the cultivator who had knocked him just now. However, the cultivator had long disappeared.

This note was obviously from Yan Ruoxue. She was probably being watched by the Yan family and could not leave. Otherwise, she would definitely look for Qin Yu directly.

Qin Yu gripped the slip of paper tightly and knew he must remain calm to avoid attracting too much attention in such a crowded place. He needed to wait for Yan Ruoxue’s news before he made his next decision.

In his heart, Yan Ruoxue’s safety was far more important than the opportunity on the day of the Path of Heaven. He would not put Yan Ruoxue in danger for the sake of advancement.

Qin Yu put away the note, sat down, and started cultivating again. However, he could not fully immerse himself in his cultivation. Instead, he was paying attention to his surroundings and waiting for Yan Ruoxue’s news.

The incredible cold killing intents in the surroundings was increasing. Their target seemed to be Qin Yu.

At this moment, the barrier not far away suddenly trembled again. It seemed that someone was forcefully barging in!

“Hmm?” The elders of the various aristocratic families raised their heads and looked at the barrier that had been set up not far away.

Under everyone’s gaze, the barrier’s vibration became increasingly intense. It was like the end of the world, and the surrounding spiritual energy turned chaotic.

When the tremors were the most intense, a magnificent internal qi swept over suddenly. It was as if an ancient divine beast had awakened, shaking the heavens and earth.

With a dragon’s roar and phoenix’s cry, a massive hole finally appeared in the barrier. In an instant, a gigantic white crane that was as white as a divine crane broke through space and flew out of the barrier.

Endless radiance shed from Immortal Crane’s body like snowflakes. It made the entire world look particularly mysterious and beautiful.

Following closely behind was a figure. He was Xiao Sheng.

His internal qi was tremendously terrifying and unfathomable. Coupled with his cold countenance, Xiao Sheng looked even more sacred and magnificent.

Behind Immortal Crane and Xiao Sheng was a dense group of thousands of demon cultivators. They were like a massive army, with each cultivator emitting an incredibly powerful internal qi that stifled the air.

The scene was like a mythical scene, making everyone present feel an indescribable shock. At this moment, everyone could only look up at the swirling Immortal Crane, the awe-inspiring Xiao Sheng, and the incomparably powerful cultivators of the demon race.

Although they were the participants of the day of the Path of Heaven, the scene the people saw at this moment still somewhat shocked them. Their expressions instantly changed.

“The demon race people are here too!” someone shouted.

Instantly, countless cultivators were awakened. They stood up and looked coldly at this group of uninvited guests.

“Demon race… How dare you come here?” At this moment, Si Liuhe stepped forward.

With his hands behind his back and a single leap, he arrived in front of Immortal Crane.

Seeing Si Liuhe, Xiao Sheng’s face turned terribly cold! He looked at Si Liuhe coldly and said stiffly, “My brother died at the hands of your Si family!”

“Xiao Hai,” Xiao Sheng said coldly.

Si Liuhe pretended to be puzzled. He rubbed his forehead, then patted his head and said, “Who is Xiao Hai? Where did this Tom, Dick, and Harry come from? My Si family has killed countless people. How would I remember such a nameless person?”

“You’re courting death!” Xiao Sheng, who had always been calm, flew into a rage when he heard this. He instantly lost his mind!

Even though it was the day of the Path of Heaven, he did not care at all. He raised his hand and smashed at Si Liuhe.

The air seemed to have frozen. In the area swept by Xiao Sheng’s palm, nature’s spiritual energy surged madly like sea waves, and the heavens and earth changed color.

Xiao Sheng’s palm contained all his anger and killing intent, enough to turn a mountain into dust.

His internal qi was so terrifying that even Si Liuhe’s expression slightly changed!

Xiao Sheng’s palm strike seemed to be able to destroy the heavens and earth. The wind from his palm seemed to have sealed the world, turning the surrounding air into his weapon!

His palm condensed with a layer of faint light. It was the incredible power in his body that erupted in an instant, forming a shocking scene. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

This palm swept through the air, causing the surrounding qi to surge. It was as if a world-class hurricane was raging wildly. That terrifying power was enough to turn all life in the surroundings into ashes!

Endless killing intent and dominance filled his palms. It was like an ancient mountain peak that made people hard to breathe!

Everyone was shocked by this palm strike. Qin Yu’s expression also changed slightly!

How did Xiao Sheng have such a terrifying internal qi? Could it be that he had already stepped into the True Saint Realm?

Impossible! With his personality, if he had stepped into the True Saint Realm, he would have gone to the Si family and started a massacre!

Under his palm strike, Si Liuhe felt a strong gust of wind blowing on his face. The power of the wind made him feel a bit of pressure as if a mountain was pressing down on him, making his heart beat faster.

He could clearly feel that Xiao Sheng’s palm strike was not only filled with powerful killing intent, but it also contained monstrous anger.

The surrounding cultivators all felt the terror of this palm strike. The endless tremors made them feel panic.

They looked at that palm and felt endless powerlessness. It was like an unconquerable canyon, making them unable to imagine how terrifying that palm was!

However, Si Liuhe stood still and allowed the palm strike to hit him.

Just as the palm approached, the surrounding dao techniques suddenly surged and completely dissolved Xiao Sheng’s palm strike.

It was the power of the Path of Heaven!

On the day of the Path of Heaven, no one was allowed to make a move. All internal qi would be easily devoured by the Path of Heaven!

The crowd held their breath, and Xiao Sheng’s expression became even colder.

“Where did this person come from? He’s so terrifying!” someone exclaimed.

“From the demon race? Is the demon race that terrifying…”

Si Liuhe clasped his hands behind his back. He looked at Xiao Sheng, sighed, and said, “There was a rumor saying Xiao Hai was unparalleled in the world, and his brother was even more talented. I thought it was just a rumor, but it seemed true.”

In the face of Si Liuhe’s compliments, Xiao Sheng’s face was still as cold as ice.

He looked at Si Liuhe coldly and said, “No matter who kills my brother, I will make his entire family die with him. Your Si family is no exception.”

Although Xiao Sheng’s voice was calm, his words were like a bolt of lightning, causing everyone’s expression to change drastically!
