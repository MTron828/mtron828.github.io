Chapter 114: Why Don’t I Know You? Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Seeing that Qin Yu didn’t say anything, Sun Ying continued, “You must have been kicked out again. My sister probably didn’t give you any money, right?”

Qin Yu didn’t say anything.

When he was in the Su family, he would often be kicked out by Su Yan because of small matters, and she wouldn’t give him a single cent.

At that time, Qin Yu couldn’t figure out why Su Yan would fly into a rage when it was obviously a very small matter.

It was only later that Qin Yu figured out that it was to let Qin Yu make room so that she could have a chance to stay with Zhao Gang.

“Forget it. You’re quite pitiful too. Why don’t you join us?” Sun Ying muttered.

Qin Yu glanced at her and said, “No need.”

“Tsk tsk, are you embarrassed? How can you live without money? Don’t try to keep up appearances. Who are you pretending for?” Sun Ying snickered.

Qin Yu couldn’t be bothered to argue with Sun Ying. All his thoughts were on the Water Dragon Cave.

“You came here today for Young Master Liu’s martial arts competition, right?” Sun Ying continued to ask.

Qin Yu glanced at her and nodded. “That’s right.”

“Tsk tsk.” Sun Ying couldn’t help but twitch her lips.

“Both of you are called Qin Yu. Why is the difference so big?” Sun Ying snickered.

“Sun Ying, is this your friend?” At this moment, a graceful young man suddenly walked over from a short distance away.

Seeing this young man, Sun Ying and the others hurriedly went up to greet him.

“Mr. Long, you’re here too.” Sun Ying and the others shouted one after another. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

The man who was called Mr. Long nodded slightly and said, “Yep, it’s such a big matter. Of course, I want to watch the fun. Moreover, Young Master Liu and I are friends. Of course I can’t miss it.”

“Wow, you and Young Master Liu are friends?” When they heard this, the eyes of Sun Ying and the others immediately lit up.

“That’s right. Young Master Liu and I have known each other for many years. We can be considered old friends.” Mr. Long bragged.

“Wow, Mr. Long, you’re too awesome!” Sun Ying said excitedly.

At this point, Sun Ying said with a smile, “Mr. Long, look, this place is sealed off. We’re not allowed to enter. Since you and Young Master Liu are friends, can you bring us in?”

“That’s right. That’s right. Mr. Long, standing here is too far away. We can’t see anything clearly!” Sun Ying’s classmate also shouted.

The man who was called Mr. Long frowned slightly.

In fact, Mr. Long and Young Master Liu couldn’t be considered familiar with each other. They had only attended the same dinner once. It was uncertain whether Liu Shihui remembered him or not.

But in front of so many people, Mr. Long still braced himself and said, “No problem. Young Master Liu and I are friends. I’ll just ask him.”

“Wow, that’s great!” Sun Ying and the others shouted excitedly.

Qin Yu glanced at him and didn’t say anything.

Qin Yu never had a good impression of rich playboys.

“Hey, it’s probably going to start in a little more than an hour, right?” Sun Ying’s classmate, Chen Xin, said.

“I wonder who Qin Yu is. He actually dares to challenge Young Master Liu.”

“Yeah, he’s really too big for his britches.”

Everyone discussed animatedly. At this time, Mr. Long said nonchalantly, “Qin Yu’s background isn’t simple. As far as I know, he’s from a prominent family in Jingdu.”

“A prominent family in Jingdu?” When he heard this, Sun Ying and Chen Xin were somewhat surprised.

Mr. Long nodded and said nonchalantly, “That’s right, and it’s a very powerful family.”

“No wonder he dared to challenge Young Master Liu.” Sun Ying came to a realization.

“Hmph, what’s the use of having a powerful background? A martial arts competition isn’t a competition of family backgrounds.” Chen Xin snickered.

Mr. Long smiled and said, “As far as I know, Qin Yu is quite strong.”

When he heard this, even Qin Yu couldn’t help but turn around and look over.

Mr. Long said nonchalantly, “To tell you the truth, Qin Yu and I also have quite a good relationship.”

“Wow, Mr. Long, you’re too awesome! You actually know Qin Yu!” Sun Ying’s mouth was agape, and her big eyes were full of admiration.

Mr. Long nodded slightly and said, “That’s right. We’ve eaten and drank together.”

“As expected of Mr. Long! You know so many important people!” Chen Xin gave him a thumbs up.

Mr. Long said with a smile, “It’s nothing. It’s just because of the business dealings of my family. It’s not worth mentioning.”

As he listened to Mr. Long bragging, Qin Yu couldn’t bear it anymore.

He walked up to Mr. Long and said with a nonchalant smile, “You said you know Qin Yu?”

Mr. Long glanced at Qin Yu and said nonchalantly, “Of course, and he’s tight with me.”

Qin Yu sneered and said, “Then why don’t I know you?”
