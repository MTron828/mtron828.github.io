Chapter 816: Chapter 816, the death of Granny Qin Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

“The method to undo the god binding spell?”Granny Qin couldn’t help but burst into laughter when she heard this.

“Qin Yu, so the higher-ups used the god binding spell on Yan Ruoxue. hahahaha! Even if you take her away, it’s useless! hahahaha!”

Granny Qin’s Loud Laughter Made Qin Yu’s ears hurt.

He frowned and said, “Can you stop laughing?”

Granny Qin sneered, “Qin Yu, under the spirit binding technique, so what if you take her away?”

“Do you know how to undo the spirit binding technique?”Qin Yu said impatiently.

Granny Qin looked at Qin Yu coldly and said, “Impossible, I’m not qualified to touch the spirit binding technique.”

“Even you don’t know it?”Qin Yu frowned even more.

Granny Qin sneered and said, “On the surface, I am indeed a top-level executive of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association, but in their eyes, I’m nothing. I’m not even a chess piece.”

Qin Yu was silent. Just as Granny Qin said, the top-level was the real manager.

“In that case, I Won’t disturb you.”Qin Yu got up and was ready to leave.

“Wait.”At this moment, Granny Qin stopped Qin Yu.

“What’s the matter? Do you still have something to do?”Qin Yu turned around and asked.

Granny Qin said in a deep voice, “You... forget it, you can go.”

Qin Yu sneered, “You’re so coy.”

After saying this, Qin Yu prepared to leave.

At this moment.

A light suddenly flashed in the room.

The moment the light appeared, a shadow floated out.

Qin Yu had seen this shadow before. It was the old man he saw at the entrance of the second mystic realm.

Granny Qin’s expression changed when she saw this old man.

She knelt on the ground and said in a trembling voice, “Greetings, Sir...”

The old man glanced around and said coldly, “Qin Yu? Why is he here?”

“I can be wherever I want to be. It’s none of your business.”Qin Yu turned around and walked back. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

The old man said coldly, “Qin Yu, you took Yan Ruoxue away. This is a capital offense. Do you know that?”

“I Know Your Grandpa!”Qin Yu could not help but curse.

“Old Man, let me ask you, do you know the method to undo the God binding spell?”

The old man sneered, “So what if I know it? So what if I don’t know it? Do you think I will tell you?”

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and said, “Old Bi, you’re good. You can wash your neck and wait in the second secret realm. I’ll tear your head off sooner or later!”

The old man seemed to be too lazy to pay attention to Qin Yu. He looked at Granny Qin and then looked at little black.

“Granny Qin, why haven’t you dealt with the matter that was ordered by the higher-ups?”The old man said coldly.

Beads of sweat appeared on Granny Qin’s forehead. She said in a trembling voice, “Sir, please plead for me. I treat Blacky as my son. I. . . I can’t do it...”

“If you can’t do it, then we will send someone to kill him,”the old man said coldly.

“No! !”Granny Qin immediately let out a shrill cry.

She hurriedly turned around and said anxiously, “Blackie, take the bank card and run! Run as far as you can!”

“Granny Qin, are you going to betray the Jingdu Martial Arts Association! ?”The old man shouted.

Granny Qin gritted her teeth and said, “I’m willing to die for him! All the mistakes are because of me, and it has nothing to do with Blackie...”

The old man’s brows immediately furrowed tightly.

He looked coldly at Granny Qin and said, “Are you really going to do that?”

“Yes, yes, I’m willing to die for Blackie...”Granny Qin knelt on the ground, tears streaming down her face.

Blackie, who was at the side, was already anxious. He said anxiously, “What right do you have to let my mother die! I’ll kill you!”

“Blackie! !”Granny Qin stopped Blackie.

She said with a trembling voice, “Listen to your mother. Leave quickly. Go as far away as possible...”

The old man looked coldly at Granny Qin and said, “Since you’ve already made up your mind, I won’t say anything more. This is your own choice. Don’t blame me.”

With that said, the Phantom waved its hand, and black smoke immediately rose from Granny Qin’s body!

This seemed to be the mark left by the Jingdu Martial Arts Association on Granny Qin’s body. Its purpose was to prevent anyone from betraying it!

As the black smoke exploded, Granny Qin’s mouth immediately let out a painful scream!

“Mother! !”Blacky seemed to have gone mad as it hugged Granny Qin tightly.

But no matter what he did, he could not stop the black smoke from spreading!

As the black gas exploded, Granny Qin’s body was being destroyed bit by bit!

“Mother!”At this moment, Blackie was like a helpless child.

He tried his best to use his body to stop the black gas from spreading.

However, it was useless. Blackie could only watch Granny Qin’s body disappear bit by bit.

“Blackie... Escape...”Granny Qin said with difficulty.

In a moment, Granny Qin’s body turned into black gas and disappeared into thin air.

“Mother! ! !”

Blackie kneeled on the ground and wailed at the top of his lungs!

The shadow was like an emotionless machine. It only snorted coldly and then slowly disappeared.

Blackie half kneeled on the ground and tears covered his face.

His body trembled slightly. Because he was too sad, he suddenly spat out a mouthful of blood!

Then, he looked extremely weak. He collapsed on the ground, extremely weak.

Qin Yu stood silently at the side.

Granny Qin’s death was obviously good news for Qin Yu, but at this moment, Qin Yu could not be happy.

“Jingdu Martial Arts Association... is really vicious and merciless,”Qin Yu said in a low voice.

“I must kill them... I must kill them...”these words kept coming out of Blackie’s mouth.

His face was mixed with blood and tears, looking extremely pitiful.

Qin Yu stood in front of Blackie and said in a low voice, “Make yourself stronger, so strong that you can make Jingdu martial arts association disappear.”

Little Black seemed to have lost his mind as he slumped to the ground without saying a word.

Qin Yu sighed slightly. He did not say anything more and turned to leave.

Granny Qin was dead.

This news quickly spread throughout the entire Jingdu and even the entire fire country.

“The Jingdu Martial Arts Association this year is really not going well.”

“That’s right. First, the black and gold robe was beheaded, then the purple robe was beheaded. Qu Qu and Granny Qin followed closely behind. It’s really unbelievable.”

“It seems that Xia Hang is going to officially take over the Jingdu Martial Arts Association.”

“I have to admire that Qin Yu. He really makes the Jingdu Martial Arts Association... Restless.”

Everyone knew that Granny Qin was dead, but no one knew that Granny Qin was killed by one of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association’s people.
