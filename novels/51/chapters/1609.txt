The deputy sect leader swept his gaze across the crowd. His face was full of anger, and his face was flushed red. He seemed to have reached the peak of his anger.

However, it was difficult for the crowd to calm down. At a time like this, no one was afraid of the deputy sect leader.

They continued to chatter non-stop, almost belittling the sect leader of the Heavenly Cloud sect into a villain.

The deputy sect leader couldn’t take it anymore. He angrily said, “The sect leader is simply...”

“It’s not what you say.”Di Zun hurriedly stopped the deputy sect master.

He stood in front of the deputy sect master and said with a smile, “Everyone, please calm down. The sect master will not sit idly by. If you don’t mind, you can stay in the Tianyun sect for now.”

“What’s the use of US staying here? Don’t tell me all the disciples are coming to the Tianyun Sect?”A sect master sneered.

“That’s right. We don’t want to leave our disciples outside.”

Di Zun cupped his hands and said, “Everyone, don’t worry. Yongji and the others won’t make a move for the time being. As for what happens later, we’ll think of a way.”

Hearing Di Zun’s words, everyone’s anger slightly subsided.

During this period of time, Yongji and the others indeed didn’t appear again. It was just that the cultivators of the northern region were generally stronger than those of the southern region, which also led to continuous casualties in the southern region.

However, at this time, they had no way to ask the Heavenly Cloud sect to do more.

At the northern border.

Feng Hai and Yong Ji stood on the other side of the river of death.

The two of them didn’t go back, nor did they step into the southern region.

The reason was none other than fear of the sect master of the Heavenly Cloud sect.

They were afraid that the sect master of the Heavenly Cloud sect would attack them, so they hid at the northern border. Once they saw that things weren’t going well, they quickly fled back to the northern region.

“Say, do you think the sect master of the Tianyun sect has really returned?”Feng Hai sat by the Dead River and said in a low voice.

Yong ji sneered and said, “How would I know?”

Feng Hai said in a deep voice, “I always feel that this is fake. Otherwise, why would he not make a move? What is he waiting for?”

Hearing this, Yong Ji looked at Feng Hai and sneered, “If you don’t believe it, you can go to the Tianyun sect to test it out. If he doesn’t return, then you will have made a meritorious deed.”

Feng Hai glanced at Yong Ji and said with a light snort, “Why don’t you go?”

“Do I dare to go? If he really comes back, the first one to be killed will definitely be me!”Yong Ji said coldly.

Feng Hai sighed slightly and said with a sigh, “Not to mention you and me, even the godly monarchs of the northern lands do not dare to provoke him. According to what I know, they seem to be waiting for the revival of the Northern Land’s Lord.”

“Isn’t that enough? Who is willing to offend that God of Plagues?”Yong Ji snorted coldly.

“Then are we just going to wait here?”Feng Hai couldn’t help but shiver.

Yong Ji stretched lazily and said, “Just wait. The Godly kings of the northern land will make a decision.”

In the next few days, the Southern Region welcomed a short period of silence.

The disappearance of Yong Ji and Feng Hai made the cultivators of the northern land begin to restrain themselves. Some even retreated toward the northern border.

They were not the only ones. The three godly monarchs of the northern region also did not dare to act rashly.

The injuries on their bodies had mostly recovered. They had also heard of the situation in the southern region.

“Is the sect master of the Heavenly Cloud sect really back? Why do I feel that it’s fake?”A godly monarch asked.

“That’s right. Last time, we barged into the sect and caused chaos in the Heavenly Cloud sect. He did not return either. Now, we did not even attack the heavenly cloud sect. How could he suddenly return?”Another godly monarch also sneered.

Sima bei didn’t say anything. Although they said so, no one had the courage to probe.

“It can’t go on like this. Two of our scrolls have been snatched away. Isn’t this delaying the master’s recovery?”A godly monarch said with a frown.

At this moment, Sima Bei suddenly said from the side, “That Yongji will definitely not be loyal to our northern lands.”

Hearing this, the two godly monarchs were stunned. They quickly understood what Sima bei meant.

“You mean... let Yongji test it out?”A godly monarch said.

Sima bei nodded and said, “That’s right. He has ambition and strength. He is the best choice.”

“But do you think he will go? According to what I know, Yongji seems to be very afraid of the sect master of the Tianyun sect. He is the same as you. He has long been scared out of his wits.”A godly monarch said with slight ridicule.

Sima bei glanced at him and sneered, “You say it as if you are not afraid. If you are not afraid, then you can go.”

“What do you mean!”

“I mean what you mean.”

“Sima Bei, I have tolerated you for a long time!”

“Enough, stop quarreling.”

A godly king stood up and interrupted the quarrel between the two.

He looked at Sima bei and said, “You must have a way.”

Sima bei snorted lightly and said indifferently, “I’m not like some people who speak and do things without thinking.”

“Sima Bei, are you done! ?”

“Alright, Everyone Shut Up!”The other godly king interrupted the two.

He looked at Sima bei and said, “Let’s get down to business.”

Sima bei did not continue arguing. He sneered and said, “Normally, Yongji would definitely not go to the heavenly cloud sect. However, as long as I use some tricks, I will naturally have a way to get him to go to the Heavenly Cloud Sect.”

“What Way?”The two of them frowned.

Sima bei’s expression was gloomy. He sneered but did not say a word.

...

At the northern border.

Yong Ji and Feng Hai had already been here for several days. They had no intention of going back.

“Where do you think that Qin Yu went? Is He really afraid of You?”Feng Hai asked doubtfully.

“I don’t know. If he dares to show himself, I will definitely kill him with my own hands! And that Wen Wanli!”Yong Ji said with a vicious expression.

Feng Hai opened his mouth and was about to say something when the space in front of him suddenly shook. After that, they saw Sima Bei walking out from the darkness.

Seeing Sima Bei, the two of them quickly stood up and cupped their hands, “Greetings, Lord Sima Bei.”

Sima bei said with a cold expression, “I have already sent people to investigate the situation in the South region. The sect leader of the Heavenly Cloud sect has not returned at all. That News is fake.”

Yong Ji was stunned and frowned, “May I ask, Lord Sima Bei, who told you this news? Is it accurate?”

“If it’s not accurate, I will tell you.”Sima bei snorted coldly.

“This is the news that the sect leader of the Heavenly Cloud sect is currently in the Thunder Academy in order to seek a breakthrough!”

“Thunder Academy?”Yong Ji and Feng Hai looked at each other.

“That’s right. He is currently in seclusion in the Thunder Yard.”Sima bei said coldly.

After saying this, he took out a gift box from his clothes and handed it to Yong Ji.

“Take this gift and go to the Sky Cloud sect immediately.”Sima bei said. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Yong Ji’s expression changed slightly. He frowned and said, “Should I go? Lord Sima Bei, it’s better for you to go personally.”

When Sima bei heard this, he immediately berated, “If I can go, what do I Need You For? Bring this gift to the Heavenly Cloud sect and say that it was given to him by the Master of my Northern Lands!”
