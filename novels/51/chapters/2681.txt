Chapter 2682 - 2682: The Three Holy Living Beings

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Qin Yu’s divine soul was still expanding exponentially. That Miracle Power instantly turned his divine soul into a black hole.

Countless amounts of Saint Power entered his divine soul, causing his strength to continue rising.

This was the manifestation of his future strength.

In other words, it was very likely that he would reach this level if he did not use this Miracle Qi.

After an unknown period, his soul power finally reached the ultimate point.

That terrifying divine might caused everyone in the core region of the Saint Kingdom to feel their divine souls tremble.

The stronger the person, the more one could feel this terrifying power. “Could it be that a new Holy Lord has been born? How could it be so fast?”

A fat middle-aged man with a red nose shivered and said with some doubt.

“It doesn’t seem like it. That internal qi was only at the True Consciousness Realm an hour ago. It didn’t even reach the Dao Realm. It must have taken some heaven-defying item to increase its strength.”

An old man dressed in farmer’s clothes, fishing barefoot, said with a smile opposite him.

Six out of ten teeth were missing when he smiled, but this appearance did not affect his terrifying aura.

“Then what do you mean, Third Brother? Are we, the three great living beings in the Saint Kingdom just sitting here and not doing anything?”

The man with the rosacea laughed.

“I don’t care. It’s none of my business who becomes the Holy Lord. They can’t catch me anyway.”

A lazy young man was lying on the lawn with a piece of foxtail grass in his mouth.

“What a terrifying divine might! This power has even surpassed Chen Shuang’s, to the point where we can’t sense it. What a pity! If he hadn’t consumed the thing, he would have had a chance to become a Holy Lord. He might even have a chance to transcend the seventh level of the tribulation and condense a divinity. It’s a pity that this kid has no future now.”

The barefooted old man pulled up the fishing rod, and a flood dragon that was thousands of meters long rose with the fishing rod.

With a gentle flick of his wrist, the flood dragon was thrown into the fish tank beside him. It shrunk and swam around in the fish tank.

Its small eyes looked at the old man with a frightened expression. It wondered why it was suddenly caught by the old man while it was swimming freely in its territory.

“The eighteen Saint Kingdoms have sealed the passageway between the two worlds for three years. Chen Shuang has used the power of Saint Kingdom to break through the passageway between the two worlds. Now, it seems that there are still many geniuses in the lower realm. It’s just that they lack the opportunity. I reckon that many geniuses are similar to this child in this Saint

Kingdom.”

The rosacea man’s expression turned cold.

“However, a new Holy Lord must not appear. Otherwise, it will be a huge threat to us. Once someone shows this sign, we have to kill them with all our strength. Chen Shuang is an example. He had already killed two of us. If a new Holy Lord appears, I’m afraid the three of us might not even be able to survive.

The old man nodded in agreement with the rosacea man’s remark.

Only the lazy young man lay on the grass and did not speak. No one knew what he was thinking.

“Then what are you thinking about, Third Brother?”

Seeing that the young man had not spoken, the man with the rosacea asked curiously.

The young man spat out the foxtail grass in his mouth, and it transformed into a terrifying sword light.

The shocking sword intent suddenly destroyed the calm lake. The calm lake water was sent flying by the sword intent.

The sword scar lingered in the sky for a long time and did not dissipate.

“Third Brother, you broke through again!”

The old man stood up in horror.

“I’m not thinking about anything. I just feel that this Saint Kingdom is too oppressive and want to go out for a walk.”

He said softly.

The old man and the rosacea man fell silent. They knew that it was impossible.

The lives of the living beings born in this Saint Kingdom were bound to the kingdom and would never be able to leave it.

Even as the strongest living beings in this world, they could not escape this fate.

At this moment, a young man with a tall figure and a cold expression slowly stood up in another place.

“Qin Yu, is that you?”

In another place, a young man who looked the same was also looking at the Demon Sealing Valley. However, the expression on his face was filled with warmth.

“Qin Yu…lf anything happens to you, I won’t forgive you!”

Yan Ruoxue, who was dressed in a white dress, stared at the place where dusk had begun with red eyes. Her hands were clenched tightly, and her body was trembling uncontrollably.

Qin Yu was too powerful now. This abnormal strength made her feel extreme fear.

Qin Yu raised his head slightly. At this moment, he was at the peak of her strength. He could see the operations of the entire Saint Kingdom.

He saw the living beings born from the Saint Kingdom. Many were like living beings in the lower realm, the lowest level ordinary people in this Saint Kingdom.

He saw that there were countless outsiders in this Saint Kingdom. Not only were some carrying divine souls, divine flame, and runes, but many other people were also hiding in this Saint Kingdom. They all had their thoughts and were moving around in the kingdom.

He saw that in the vast Saint Kingdom, countless powers from the lower realm were being absorbed into this Saint Kingdom, and then transformed into pure holy energy that surged in this kingdom.

He saw some powerful people. These people had absorbed the vast holy energy of the Saint Kingdom, and they were so powerful that even Qin Yu was shocked.

That was especially true with the power of three people. He could feel their power like the heat of the sun. Even if he used all the power of two Hearts of Saint Kingdom, it was far from comparable.

He had seen the suffering of the low-level people. He had never thought that people would be starving to death in the Saint Kingdom.

Powerful people occupied the heaven-defying holy energy, while those who lived in the most impoverished areas could not even afford to eat. Qin Yu was extremely shocked.

He saw countless ancient demons suppressed in Chen Shuang’s Saint Kingdom. They were the fiercest demons in the universe. A huge amount of Saint Power had been used to seal them.

With my power, I would atone for the sins of the people.

After seeing such a huge amount of information, Qin Yu came to a sudden realization. He began to understand why the Dao Mystical Saint Kingdom was the weakest of the 18 divine kingdoms.

With so many powerhouses suppressing so many ancient demons, this already

occupied a huge amount of Saint Power. How could the Dao Mystical Saint Kingdom become strong?

However, all of this had nothing to do with him.

After reaching the peak, his divine soul was like a punctured balloon, declining at a terrifying speed.

His divine sense seemed shackled, and his body began to disintegrate.

The Seal of Heaven Returning seemed to have sensed the danger. It surged wildly.Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

However, it was still unable to stop his declining body.

Another mark lit up at the same time. It was the power of another Heart of

Saint Kingdom..
