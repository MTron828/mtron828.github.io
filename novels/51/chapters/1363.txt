Chapter 1364: Chapter 1,364, everything he had learned in his life 

Qin Yu walked all the way to the exit. His face was gloomy, and he planned to break open this secret realm by force.

This secret realm was created by Wen Wanji, but with Qin Yu’s ability, he might be able to break it open by force.

He bent his right fist, and golden light flickered. Just as he was about to break open this secret realm, the exit suddenly flashed with light.

The next second, Wen Wanji walked in.

“Master.”Qin Yu bowed to Wen Wanji.

Wen wanji sized up Qin Yu. He seemed to have seen through Qin Yu’s intentions.

“What do you want?”Wen Wanji asked with a cold face.

Qin Yu sighed and said, “I have a bad feeling in my heart. I really can’t stay here any longer.”

Wen wanyi raised his hand and pressed on Qin Yu’s neck. A huge force burst out.

He pulled Qin Yu to the side and then said coldly, “What I ask you to do is enough. Do you remember?”

Qin Yu smiled bitterly.

Although he said so, he was not a selfish person.

At this moment, Qin Yu thought of the keepsake that Yan Ruoxue had given him.

She had said in the letter that if she ran into trouble that she couldn’t solve, she would crush the Keepsake. At that time, the Yan family would definitely send someone.

If the Yan family really sent someone, then the Heavenly Cloud sect wasn’t even worth mentioning.

After much hesitation, Qin Yu finally put away the keepsake.

Unless it was absolutely necessary, Qin Yu really didn’t want to trouble Yan Ruoxue.

I wonder how long that bastard iron egg will sleep for, Qin Yu thought to himself.

Iron Egg was at the peak of the Almighty Realm, and his strength was extremely powerful.

If he woke up, he might be able to help.

“Follow me,”Wen Wenti said at this moment.

Qin Yu followed behind Wen Wenti and came to the depths of the secret realm.

“Wait for me here,”Wen Wenti said with a solemn expression.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “Okay.”

Wen wanye turned around and left. A few minutes later, he returned with Wen Dawen and Wen Er.

The few of them gathered together and Wen Wanye handed a card to Wen Dawen.

“There is a sum of money in this card. From now on, I will hand it over to you,”Wen Wanye said.

Seeing this one meter, Qin Yu’s expression immediately became extremely ugly.

“Master, what are you doing?”Qin Yu frowned.

Wen Wanli ignored Qin Yu’s words and said, “I am taking you to a place. This mystic realm is not safe after all. Remember, don’t come back unless it is necessary.”

Hearing this, Qin Yu finally couldn’t bear it anymore.

He rushed forward and said coldly, “If this is the case, I would rather bear it myself.”

“Don’t mess around!”Wen wentu scolded.

“I’m not messing around. I have a way to protect myself,”Qin Yu said seriously.

At this moment, Qin Yu had already prepared to crush the token.

But at this moment, a big hand suddenly slapped over.

Before Qin Yu could react, Wen Wentu’s palm had already ruthlessly slapped Qin Yu’s head.

Qin Yu’s vision went black, and he felt everything in front of him shake.

He tried his best to hold on to his consciousness, intending to crush the token.

“You can hold on quite well.”But at this moment, Wen Wanli slapped Qin Yu’s head again.

Finally, Qin Yu couldn’t hold on any longer and completely fainted.

When Qin Yu woke up again, he was already in an extremely unfamiliar environment.

It seemed to be a volcano. As soon as he opened his eyes, he was greeted by a wave of heat.

And on one side of the mountain, there was a huge fire pit.

The Flames in the pit seemed to have a life of their own as they kept jumping out.

“You’re Awake?”Wen Wanji’s voice was heard.

Qin Yu rubbed his eyes and frowned. “Where is this?”

Wen Wentong said, “You don’t need to know where this is. In short, you will stay here for the next period of time.”

Qin Yu looked around and found that the surrounding space had been completely sealed.

He raised his hand and touched it, but there was no way out.

Wen Da and Wen Er were also at the side. They were no longer as relaxed and playful as before. Instead, there was an indescribable solemnity on their faces.

Qin Yu knew that all of this had happened because of him, so he felt very ashamed.

“From now on, I’m going to give you special training for three days,”Wen Wanyun said coldly.

Qin Yu clenched his teeth. He raised his head to look at Wen wanyun and said, “Master, you’d better hand me over. This matter has nothing to do with you.”

“Don’t talk nonsense. His tianyun sect might not be able to do anything to me,”Wen Wanyun said.

“I will run away if necessary.”

Then, Wen Wanyun raised his hand and pointed at the flame below.

“This flame is called the body tempering flame. It is very suitable for you,”said Wen Wanyun.

“I have brought a few disciples here before. Some of them couldn’t bear it, and some of them died in this flame. But I think this flame is nothing to you.”

Qin Yu lowered his head to look at the dancing flames. He had a faint sense of longing in his heart.

Before Qin Yu could prepare himself, Wen Wanli had already slapped Qin Yu’s back.

In an instant, Qin Yu’s body sank into the flames.

Countless tongues of fire surged from all directions and wrapped around Qin Yu.

They clung onto Qin Yu’s body crazily, as if they wanted to devour him.

Stinging pain!

This was Qin Yu’s first feeling.

It was as if there were countless needles stabbing into his body!

They pierced through Qin Yu’s skin and into his blood, as if they wanted to evaporate his blood!

The pain made Qin Yu Grimace, but he gritted his teeth and did not make a sound.

From the initial rolling, Dao gradually calmed down, and Qin Yu only used less than ten minutes.

Looking at Qin Yu who was sitting cross-legged below, a smile appeared on Wen Wanji’s face, and his eyes were filled with love.

“Sure enough, this flame is nothing to him,”Wen Wanji said with a smile.

Wen Da and Wen Er were also a little surprised.

They had followed Wen Wanji and seen many people jump into the flame, but the final result was extremely miserable.

Qin Yu’s calmness was simply unheard of!

“Qin Yu, how do you feel?”Wen wentu shouted from above.

Qin Yu gritted his teeth and said, “I’m alright. I can withstand it.” 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Wen wentu nodded slightly. He extended his palm and an icy blue aura turned into a long robe, scooping Qin Yu out of the flames.

Standing above, Wen Wanji looked at Qin Yu and said slowly, “Next, I will teach you everything I have learned in my life.”
