The next day, Qin Yu didn’t go out.

He sat in the hotel with his eyes closed while comprehending the cultivation method in his mind.

In addition to looking at the realm, the cultivation method was also an extremely important factor that determined strength.

A top-grade cultivation method could even allow an ordinary person to advance to the next level.

There were countless cultivation methods in Qin Yu’s inheritance. Any random one was enough to shock the world.

On the other side, Zhou Tong was sitting at home and sulking.

When he thought of Qin Yu’s arrogant expression, he felt enraged.

“Enough. It’s just a small matter. Why are you so angry?” A beautiful woman beside him advised in a soft voice.

Zhou Tong glanced at her and berated coldly, “What do you know?! I, Zhou Tong, am a reputable person. In the entire provincial capital, who wouldn’t show me some respect?”

“He, Qin Yu, is just a country bumpkin from the countryside. How dare he be so disrespectful to me and even speak so rudely?!” The more Zhou Tong thought about it, the angrier he got. He waved his arm and threw all the things on the table to the ground.

The beautiful woman at the side didn’t dare to say anything when she saw this. She could only sigh.

Zhou Tong sneered and said, “It’s wrong for young people to be arrogant and defiant. If I, Zhou Tong, don’t teach him a lesson, I won’t be called Zhou Tong!”

Thinking of this, Zhou Tong said to the beautiful woman, “Go and bring me my precious Ganoderma.”

“What do you want to do?” The beautiful woman frowned, as if she was a little worried.

Zhou Tong said impatiently, “Do whatever I tell you to do. Why do you have to ask so many questions?!”

The beautiful woman forced a smile and could only turn around to return to her room and take out the Ganoderma.

After Zhou Tong took the Ganoderma, he turned around and was about to leave.

“Zhou Tong, forget it. You have to try to forgive people.” The beautiful woman grabbed Zhou Tong’s arm and said softly.

Zhou Tong sneered. “Why did I work so hard to climb to a high position? It was to make these people at the bottom respect me! Otherwise, what’s the point of me working hard for most of my life?”

After saying this, Zhou Tong turned around and left.

Although Zhou Tong wasn’t a good person, he did have some medicine skills. Therefore, he had accumulated countless connections over the years.

In the martial arts world, many people owed Zhou Tong a favor, so Zhou Tong was full of confidence.

In a private manor.

This manor occupied an extremely large area and was obviously the home of a wealthy family.

At this time, in the manor, Zhou Tong was sitting upright with a smile on his face.

“Mr. Hong, you must help me with this matter,” Zhou Tong said courteously.

The man called Mr. Hong fumbled around with a necklace. He sized up Zhou Tong and slowly said, “Mr. Zhou, I should help you with this matter, but I heard that Qin Yu isn’t someone to be trifled with. Even the Liu family has admitted defeat.”

Zhou Tong smiled embarrassedly and said, “If he was easy to deal with, I wouldn’t have come to look for you. Besides, the Liu family is nothing compared to you.”

Mr. Hong said with a nonchalant smile, “You don’t have to flatter me. I’m afraid I can’t help you with this.”

Zhou Tong’s expression changed. He gritted his teeth and took out the Ganoderma from his pocket.

“Mr. Hong, haven’t you always wanted this Ganoderma? As long as you’re willing to help, I’ll give this Ganoderma to you!” Zhou Tong said with some distress

Seeing this Ganoderma, Mr. Hong’s eyes suddenly lit up, and he stood up quickly!

“Are you serious?” Mr. Hong stared at the Ganoderma and said. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Zhou Tong gritted his teeth and said, “Absolutely!”

Mr. Hong laughed and said, “Good, good. What do you want me to do?”

Zhou Tong said with viciousness, “It would be best if you could kill him. Even if you can’t, you must make sure that he can’t attend the Chinese Medicine Conference!”

...

Qin Yu only opened his eyes after an entire day.

Mr. Yang stood at the side and didn’t dare to say anything.

In the evening, Qin Yu opened his eyes and looked at Mr. Yang.

“Mr. Qin, you’re awake.” Mr. Yang served Qin Yu a cup of hot tea.

After Qin Yu thanked him, he took a sip of the hot tea.

“Mr. Yang, do you know of any relatively famous places in the provincial capital? Such as auctions or Jiangcheng’s medicinal herbs street?” Qin Yu asked.

Mr. Yang thought for a moment and said, “Yes, are you interested, Mr. Qin?”

Qin Yu nodded and said, “Yes.”

Since it was the provincial capital of Chuzhou, the resources here far exceeded those of Jiangcheng. Qin Yu wouldn’t miss such an opportunity.

Therefore, Mr. Yang also left the hotel and took a taxi to a place called Yunsheng Street.

On the way, Mr. Yang and Qin Yu explained, “Yunsheng Street is a gathering place for miscellaneous things. Not only are there herbs, but there are also antiques, calligraphy, and paintings.”

Qin Yu nodded. For a big city, this seemed to be very common.

Soon, the two of them arrived at Yunsheng Street.

As far as the eye could see, Yunsheng Street was filled with people, but most of them were young people.

These young people had different purposes from Qin Yu. Most of them were couples who came to take photos, or join in the fun.

Qin Yu tried to release his internal qi and sense his surroundings.

Unfortunately, there were very few martial artists here. This made Qin Yu feel a little disappointed.

This meant that the herbs in Yunsheng Street were probably very common. Otherwise, it would attract a large number of martial artists or pharmacists.

“Let’s go in and have a look,” Qin Yu waved his hand and said.

Then, Qin Yu and Mr. Yang walked into Yunsheng Street.

There were small stalls around Yunsheng Street. Just as Mr. Yang said, there were all kinds of strange things here.

Qin Yu and Mr. Yang looked for a few herb stalls, but they didn’t find any herbs worth buying.

“It seems that this place isn’t that good.” Qin Yu frowned and said.

“Rather than saying that it is a street of herbs, it is more like a tourist attraction.” Qin Yu looked around and whispered.

Mr. Yang forced a smile and said, “I’m really sorry. Based on my understanding of the provincial capital, I only know the Yunsheng Street.”

As he was speaking, Qin Yu suddenly found a familiar person.

This person was none other than Shen Tian’s good friend, Wei Ming.

The moment Qin Yu saw Wei Ming, Wei Ming also noticed Qin Yu’s gaze.

He frowned, and his expression seemed to be somewhat conflicted.

A moment later, Wei Ming actually took the initiative to walk towards Qin Yu.

This surprised Qin Yu. He turned to look at Mr. Yang and said, “Mr. Yang, stay close to me.”

Mr. Yang was stunned. Although he didn’t understand, he still stood beside Qin Yu obediently.

Soon, Wei Ming walked in front of Qin Yu.

The two of them looked at each other, and the atmosphere was a little awkward.

“What? You want to avenge Shen Tian?” Qin Yu’s internal qi was raised to the extreme.

After he felt Qin Yu’s power, Wei Ming’s heart thumped again!

He could clearly feel that Qin Yu’s strength was several times stronger than when he was in South City!

Wei Ming took a deep breath, cupped his hands and said, “Mr. Qin, don’t misunderstand. I’m just saying hello to you.”

“Oh really?” Qin Yu raised his eyebrows and couldn’t help but sneer. “What, you don’t want to take revenge for Shen Tian?”

Wei Ming forced a smile. “Mr. Qin, you must be joking. The Shen family is already in the past. What’s the point of me taking revenge for them?”

“Moreover, Mr. Qin’s future is bright. As long as one isn’t stupid, one knows who to choose.”

Wei Ming was honest. Indeed, it definitely wasn’t a wise choice to offend Qin Yu for a person who was already worthless.

“Then why did you come to me?” Qin Yu said with a nonchalant smile.

Wei Ming said, “I just want to be friends with Mr. Qin.”
