Chapter 174: If There Are no Herbs, I Will Kill Him Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

A heavy look flashed across Mr. Wu’s face.

He didn’t expect that Jiang Haoran would be so unyielding.

“Haoran, Qin Yu, he...”

“Mr. Wu, there’s no need to say more.” Before Mr. Wu could finish his words, Jiang Haoran waved his hand and interrupted him.

“Qin Yu has been in the limelight recently and he’s getting too big for his britches. He even dares to provoke the Jiang family. I think it’s time to put him in his place,” Jiang Haoran snorted coldly.

Mr. Wu knew that there was no room for compromise. He could only nod and say, “I got it, Haoran. Send my regards to your father.”

After saying this, Mr. Wu turned around and left the Jiang family.

“Qin Yu is really a troublemaker.” Mr. Wu sat in the car and lit a cigarette.

He felt a little conflicted. Should he tell Yan Ruoxue about this matter?

But after thinking for a moment, Mr. Wu finally gave up on this idea.

With the Yan family’s capabilities, perhaps they had already been secretly observing every move.

...

At this moment, Qin Yu was lying on the ground and had already fainted many times.

Every time he woke up, he would be tormented by this intense pain until he fainted again.

The collision between the spiritual energy and dark energy in his Dantian still didn’t have any momentum of stopping. Instead, it was getting more and more intense.

This also made the pain more unbearable.

Finally, Qin Yu began to adapt to the pain.

He relied on his strong willpower to grit his teeth and sit cross-legged on the ground.

“If this continues, my Dantian might be damaged.” Qin Yu wiped the sweat from his forehead.

Spiritual energy and dark energy both had no consciousness. It was impossible for them to stop on their own.

Therefore, Qin Yu had to guide the fusion of the two or coexist peacefully.

He sat cross-legged on the ground and endured the pain while starting to guide the two with his consciousness.

He originally wanted to fuse dark energy and spiritual energy, but every time they collided, Qin Yu felt a sharp pain in his abdomen and nearly fainted.

After trying eighteen times, Qin Yu gave up helplessly.

“If I can fuse them, I think my strength will probably advance by leaps and bounds.” Qin Yu took a deep breath and thought.

But unfortunately, Qin Yu could only think about it, because with his current abilities, he simply couldn’t do it.

Helpless, Qin Yu began to try to let the two coexist peacefully.

He used his consciousness to guide the two, and placed them on one side of the Dantian.

However, this was also extremely difficult for Qin Yu.

The cold sweat on his forehead didn’t stop dripping down, while his body was sometimes cold and sometimes hot.

Not far away, Jiang Yu was dumbfounded.

He had never seen such a cultivation method before!

The sky gradually brightened up, and the surrounding dark energy began to dissipate.

And at noon, Qin Yu finally opened his eyes.

‘I’ve finally completed it. Cultivating both spiritual energy and dark energy at the same time might be criticized by others, but this is the fastest way for me to cultivate,’ Qin Yu thought to himself.

Qin Yu wasn’t from a rich family, so he didn’t have any ready-made resources to enjoy.

Therefore, he could only resort to unorthodox methods.

“After experiencing torture during the night, my spiritual power seems to have increased.” Qin Yu couldn’t help but force a smile.

He tried to feel the internal qi in his body and found that he was on the brink of reaching the third level of the Foundation Establishment Stage.

“If I try again tonight, I might be able to break through to the third level of the Foundation Establishment Stage,” Qin Yu murmured.

The Foundation Establishment Stage was the most important part of cultivation. Usually, the talent of a cultivator would be revealed at this stage.

For example, Qin Yu’s blue spiritual fire, the hardness of his body, and the current dual cultivation of spiritual energy.

Qin Yu looked down at his phone and found that it was already twelve o’clock at noon.

However, the people from the Jiang family still didn’t come.

“It seems that your position in the Jiang family isn’t that high.” Qin Yu glanced at Jiang Yu and sneered.

Jiang Yu hurriedly said, “Impossible! My brother loves me very much. He will definitely come to save me!”

“Really? I hope so.” Qin Yu closed his eyes and no longer paid attention to Jiang Yu.

In the Jiang family’s home, Jiang Haoran packed up and prepared to go out.

“Eldest Young Master, I have already instructed eight great generals to go with you.” The Butler stood beside Jiang Haoran and said.

Jiang Haoran sneered and said, “There’s no need. I, Jiang Haoran, will go personally. Even if he’s the king, he has to obediently let him go.”

The butler frowned and said, “Young Master, Qin Yu’s thinking is different from ordinary people’s. You should still...”

“No one dares to cross me,” Jiang Haoran snorted lightly.

With that, he drove away from the Jiang family.

Half an hour later, Jiang Haoran finally arrived at his destination.

Looking at the surrounding environment, Jiang Haoran couldn’t help but frown.

“This is really a good place to kill people,” Jiang Haoran snorted coldly.

Then, Jiang Haoran walked in Qin Yu’s direction.

The moment he saw Jiang Haoran, Jiang Yu immediately roared crazily.

“Haoran, Haoran, save me! This madman wants to kill me!” Jiang Yu shouted at the top of his lungs.

Jiang Haoran frowned. He raised his hand and a shadow instantly slapped Jiang Yu’s face!

“Slap!” A crisp sound was heard, and Jiang Yu was instantly slapped out of his wits. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“Useless thing, the Jiang family has been thoroughly embarrassed by you!” Jiang Haoran berated coldly.

In the face of Jiang Haoran’s berating, Jiang Yu didn’t dare to say a word.

It could be seen that Jiang Haoran seemed to value the Jiang family’s honor very much.

“You’re Qin Yu?” Jiang Haoran looked at Qin Yu coldly and said.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “Young Master Jiang, have you brought the thing?”

Jiang Haoran sneered and said, “If I really give it to you, would you dare to take it?”

As soon as he said that, Jiang Haoran flicked his finger.

His Inner Strength was like a knife, and it instantly cut the rope on Jiang Yu’s body.

“Get over here! You coward!” Jiang Haoran said with a cold expression.

Jiang Yu frantically ran towards Jiang Haoran.

However, he had just taken half a step when he felt a huge force in his leg, and then he knelt on the ground with a plop!

When he saw this scene, Jiang Haoran’s expression instantly turned extremely cold!

“What do you mean by this?” Jiang Haoran said coldly.

Qin Yu said indifferently, “Young Master Jiang, have you forgotten something? You haven’t given me what I want yet.”

Jiang Haoran’s expression suddenly changed drastically!

He looked at Qin Yu coldly and said, “You actually dare to ask for it?”

“Do you think I’m joking with you?” Qin Yu said indifferently.

Jiang Haoran said coldly, “Even if it’s the king, no one dares to cross me, Jiang Haoran! Even if I don’t give it to you, what can you do about it?”

Qin Yu slowly opened his eyes.

He looked at Jiang Haoran and said coldly, “Without herbs, even if the king comes, I won’t show mercy.”

“How insolent! I won’t give it to you. I want to see what you dare to do!” Jiang Haoran snorted coldly.

“Oh really?” Qin Yu raised his eyebrows and then shook his head. “Then I can only apologize in advance.”

“Haoran, don’t provoke him. This guy is crazy. He will do anything!” Jiang Yu was instantly anxious.

However, Jiang Haoran snorted and said, “He’s just bluffing. Don’t be afraid. I don’t believe that he would dare to do anything to you.”

However, the next second, Jiang Haoran’s expression suddenly changed!

Qin Yu flicked his finger, and a terrifying force shattered Jiang Yu’s knee!

The intense pain instantly made Jiang Yu cry out in pain!

“If there are no herbs, I’ll kill him,” Qin Yu said coldly.
