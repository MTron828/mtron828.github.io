Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Qin Yu slowly circulated the Soul Torment Mind Technique. At this moment, he was circulating the cultivation method in his divine soul state.

The world in front of him suddenly began to change. Everyone in front of him appeared in different energy forms.

The stronger the divine soul, the more intense the light they emitted.

Moreover, the color leaned towards the denser divine soul. Qin Yu could feel the boundless violent internal qi within.

Circulating the masked woman’s Soul Torment Mind Technique in the state of the divine soul gave Qin Yu a brand new comprehension.

He suddenly had a guess. Could it be that the cultivation of the Soul Torment Mind Technique needed to be in the Nineteenth Prison?

He had cultivated before, but he had never experienced such a profound experience when he was only treating the injuries in his divine soul.

At this moment, the woman next to him was emitting an intense dark light that almost drowned out all the energy colors in his divine soul.

Qin Yu’s eyes swept across the surroundings and discovered that the

Nightmare that appeared around these divine souls seemed to be the same.

Moreover, every Nightmare that appeared had a chain attached to it.

Countless chains extended into the sky. There was a monster that Qin Yu did not dare to stare at.

It was Qin Yu’s first time facing such a powerful divine soul at such a close distance.

Even though he was far away, Qin Yu could still feel the power of his divine soul pain when facing this energy.

The terrifying power was emitted invisibly.

“This is the mastermind behind the plot. The divine souls of the million cultivators were used as bait to occupy the body of the Starry Sandworm.” Qin Yu’s body turned cold. If he was discovered, he might not be able to escape.

Furthermore, Qin Yu made discoveries during his investigation. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

He discovered that in the space he was in, there was an energy with the same origin as him sealed within.

And that place was the ‘home’ that he had just entered.

Qin Yu secretly guessed that when his divine soul was pulled into the Nineteenth Prison, it should have the power to seal important memories.

It included the memory of Su Yan and the Three Light Talisman.

These were the things that were in the deepest part of his memories. The fact that they had disappeared at the same time explained some of the reasons.

At this moment, the woman beside him seemed to have sensed something.

Her bloodshot eyes stared at Qin Yu and the expression on her face suddenly became distorted.

“Why do you have the fluctuation of the soul power on your body? Let me check it out!”

She suddenly smiled strangely. Her palm suddenly stabbed into Qin Yu’s head, but he did not have the slightest ability to resist.

Oh no! He had been discovered!

Qin Yu’s head exploded with a buzz.

“Go to he*l!”

At this moment, he did not care about being discovered. He punched out and directly smashed the woman’s head in front of him.

Then, he ran towards his ‘home’. At this moment, the entire Nineteenth Prison was frighteningly quiet.

Then, a mournful voice exploded in the entire space. “Who exactly are you?”

Qin Yu’s scalp felt like it was about to explode.

Even the terrifying consciousness in the air did not seem to be targeting him.

All of the Nightmare creatures looked in another direction.

Pixel-like modules appeared on the bodies of countless Nightmare, which then shattered into countless cubes and surged toward that place.

What the he*l is this?

At this moment, the originally gloomy light of the Nineteenth Prison seemed to have dimmed a lot.

And at the center was the source of the surging soul power.

It was a short-haired youth. However, he was currently in the world of Soul Torment Mind Technique.

Qin Yu saw a terrifying scene. Even the power of those terrifying Nightmares was far inferior to the power of this man.

Furthermore, the colors on the man’s body filled the most primitive darkness and destruction of the place.

It was a color that was even more intense than black. Even with a glance from afar, Qin Yu could feel its extremely evil power fluctuations!

“What a sweet soul power! I’ve never seen such a terrifying darkness in the divine soul. Is this the extremely evil power of the gods and devils in the ancient battlefield?”

That person muttered. His voice was soft, but Qin Yu could hear every word.

His body was like a black hole. Those powerful Nightmare turned into streams of light and became nutrients for his body.

He could not help but feel a little cold. For some reason, Qin Yu felt that these words were being said to him.

The Buddha in the sky roared angrily.

The place where the youth was completely turned into a chaotic line. Countless twisted black shadows suddenly rushed out from all the surrounding buildings.

These were the Nightmares that were suppressed in the Nineteenth Prison. Buddha in the sky released them.

These black shadows let out a blood-curdling roar and crazily bit the strange young man.

In an instant, the place where the young man was was completely submerged by the violent soul power.

“Path to the Yellow Springs, Yin soldiers!”

An indifferent voice slowly chanted in the air. One could hear the extreme anger hidden in the calmness.

As this voice sounded, nearly hundreds of thousands of divine souls were suddenly sucked up.

A huge green tunnel suddenly pierced through the air.

The stairs led to the top of the cloud. At the top of the cloud was the Buddha.

On the stairs, the sound of liquid flowing could be heard.

Thick blood flowed slowly, and the 100,000 vengeful souls rushed towards the young man like arrows.

Each divine soul that reached the young man exploded violently.

“He’s actually controlling these divine souls by force and using them as Yin soldiers to launch attacks!”

Qin Yu felt a chill in his heart. He did not know how such a heaven-defying method was created.

One had to know that every cultivator’s desperate measure before death was to burn their soul power.

The Buddha in the air, the one who had set up the Nineteenth Prison, could easily control all the divine souls.

The Buddha unleashed their full strength to attack the young man.

The entire Nineteenth Prison trembled and a huge bronze door appeared above the young man’s head.

At the door, there was half a broken head.Se??ch ?ew?o?e?, o?g on ?oo?l?

He leaned against the door of the ancient gate with a crazy smile.

He seemed to be communicating with the creature inside. Then, the ancient bronze door suddenly opened with a heavy sound.

The bronze door was slowly pushed open, revealing a small black crack.

As the door opened, the soul power that was approaching the young man suddenly went out of control.

It didn’t explode. Instead, it walked toward the ancient bronze door in a daze.

For some reason, as the ancient door opened, a strong sense of danger suddenly filled Qin Yu’s divine soul. It seemed to be a reminder from Soul Torment Mind Technique

“We will meet again. I will awaken your deepest Nightmare and make it my food..”
