“How dare you!”

Yao Xi’s expression changed, and a massive light of the magical artifact suddenly appeared on his body.

Neither he nor Ni Wuxiao had expected the situation to be completely reversed in just a few seconds.

“Slap!”

With a slap of his palm, the treasure light of several powerful magical artifacts was directly smashed into countless spiritual energy fragments.

The slap then landed on Yao Xi’s face, and his face instantly swelled up.

“Little b*stard!”

Yao Xi clamored incoherently.

“Slap! Slap!”

Before he could finish his sentence, Qin Yu directly slapped his face again.

Several teeth flew out of his mouth, and Yao Xi’s face was swollen.

Yao Xi was stunned, and so was everyone else.

The Yao family’s Holy Son was actually slapped in public?

“You’re f*cking courting death!”

A destructive internal qi erupted from Yao Xi’s body as countless shadows of the Saint condensed above his head.

That aura had surpassed the power of True Saint and contained a terrifying heavenly might.

Countless thunderbolts appeared in the sky as if they were checking if this force had destroyed the rules of the Path of Heaven.

“Slap!”

Qin Yu could not care less about the Saint’s power that landed on his body at all. He slapped Yao Xi’s face again.

This worthless person had insulted Yan Ruoxue and completely drove Qin Yu crazy.

“Ah!”

Yao Xi let out a beast-like roar.

“Yao Xi, calm down,” Ni Wuxiao scolded. He was afraid that Yao Xi would go crazy and mess up the plan.

The Saint’s power exploded inside Qin Yu’s body, and the terrifying fluctuations sent Ni Wuxiao beside him flying.

A terrifying power coursed through Qin Yu’s body and exploded, wanting to completely shatter Qin Yu’s body.

Qin Yu’s glazed holy bone emitted a bright green light as he absorbed a massive amount of vital energy into the glazed holy bone.

However, the force of the blow also made him grunt and spit out a mouthful of blood suddenly.

It was no longer Yao Xi’s power. It was as if he had borrowed the power of a mighty realm cultivator.

“Slap!”

Qin Yu grabbed Yao Xi’s collar and punched him in the mouth, shattering all his teeth.

“Try barking again!”

Qin Yu was like an angry beast. Staring at Yao Xi, his eyes flickered with a fierce light.

Yao Xi had wanted to call out again, but seeing Qin Yu’s terrifying gaze, he felt an inexplicable chill. The curse words surged into his throat, but he dared not say it out.

At this moment, he truly felt the fear of death.

The Saint’s power just now only made him spit out a mouthful of blood.

“Arrogant brat, put down Holy Son Yao.”

Ni Wuxiao was enraged. A magic sword, gleaming with a cold light, appeared in his hand.

With a gentle swipe of his right hand, the magic sword instantly emitted a terrifying power of moonlight.

Almost at the same time, tens of thousands of slashes had already fallen, and there was nowhere to dodge.

The tribulation magic sword was paired with the power of moonlight triggered by the Ni family’s immortal scripture.

Under tens of thousands of slashes, Qin Yu’s surroundings even turned into a black hole.

“Sit f*ck down! Old fart!”

Qin Yu stretched out his hand and grabbed at Ni Wuxiao.

“Arrogant! Even a tribulation magical artifact will be cut into countless pieces by my slash. You actually want to use your hands to block my slash?”

Si Wuxiao stood in the air and stared coldly.

The skin and muscles that had formed on Qin Yu’s arm were instantly cut into pieces the size of dust.

The back of his hand instantly turned into a gloomy skeleton, but when the Moonlight Slash struck the bones and blood vessels on Qin Yu’s arm, it did not even leave a mark.

“What?”

Si Wuxiao was so shocked that he could barely close his mouth.

He even felt that the Moonlight Slash could kill gods and devils, but it could only tear Qin Yu’s skin. It could not even cut his arm!

He could not imagine how Qin Yu’s body had undergone such an earth-shattering transformation in these few dozen days.

“Slap!”

With another slap, Ni Wuxiao’s face was swollen.

Ni Wuxiao’s head was stuck on the ground, and his buttocks were raised high. His mind went blank instantly.

He, Ni Wuxiao, the First Elder of the Ni family, how was he going to live in the future?

Qin Yu grabbed Yao Xi, landed on the ground, and stepped on his buttocks. Only Ni Wuxiao’s round buttock was exposed on the ground.

Seeing Si Wuxiao’s situation, the fury in Yao Xi’s heart actually reduced a little.

He seemed not as miserable…

The ground emitted a terrifying power that even shook the ground.

Ni Wuxiao floated in the air, his hair disheveled like a madman.

“Qin Yu, I want you to die!”

A terrifying internal qi erupted from his body. No one would disbelieve if he said he wanted to self-destruct.

“Elder Ni, calm down…There’s still business to attend to.”

Yao Xi said while trembling. He was really afraid that this old thing would go crazy.

He was now in Qin Yu’s hands. He did not have that kind of abnormal body.

“Qin Yu, if you don’t want your brother to die, let me go immediately. I remember your brother’s name is Chang Mang, right?”

Yao Xi shouted after he calmed down.

In an instant, a person appeared in the hands of a Yao family cultivator.

That person’s face was ashen, his muscles dry, and his internal qi extremely weak, as if he would die at any moment.

“Chang Mang!”

Qin Yu clenched his fists tightly. Under the immense force, his nails dug into his flesh, and blood dripped onto the ground. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Chang Mang was a holy body, so even if he did not cultivate, his body could still absorb the spiritual energy in the air.

The reason why he had become so weak was probably because his blood had been continuously extracted and he had been tortured.

“Holy Lord has placed a restriction on his divine sense. You better don’t be funny.”

Yao Xi sneered and said.

“I also advise you not to be funny. If you make excessive requests, even if it’s one life in exchange for two lives, I won’t lose out. Moreover, the torture my brother suffered is definitely not little.”

Qin Yu stared at the two of them, not showing any weakness.

At times like this, showing weakness would only harm Chang Mang.

Once he was captured, Chang Mang’s only chance of survival would vanish. The stronger he was now, the more likely he could negotiate.

“I don’t believe a faithful person like you would be so heartless. Once a person dies, they can’t come back to life. Are you sure you want to be so unyieldingly in talking to us? With a single thought from me, his life’s candle will be extinguished.”

Yao Xi sneered and said.

“Stop barking and state your conditions.” Qin Yu’s voice did not have the slightest fluctuation.

“My request is pretty simple. Hand Ji Yue over to us. This person has offended us. If we don’t kill her to warn the others, how can we keep our reputations in the future? How about it? Exchanging a stranger for your brother? This request isn’t excessive, right?”

“It seems someone has discovered my identity. Previously, I revealed some information to a close relative. Perhaps it has been noticed during the soul searching.”

Ji Yue’s bitter voice came from the Sumeru ring.

At this moment, countless thoughts flashed through Qin Yu’s mind as he looked for ways to break through the situation before him.

Seeing Qin Yu suddenly become silent, Yao Xi and Ni Wuxiao felt disturbed. Did Ji Yue leak the information to Qin Yu?

“I owe the owner of the Moon Listening Pavilion many favors. I can’t hand her over to you.”

Qin Yu frowned and said.
