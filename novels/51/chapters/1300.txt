Chapter 1301: Chapter 1,301, half-saint weapon 

Qin Yu didn’t know the origin of this iron rod, but its power was beyond imagination. It was definitely extraordinary.

Qin Yu wasn’t afraid even in the face of Ling Yun’s abnormal vision.

He held the iron rod in his hand, his divine power surging and his fighting spirit overflowing.

His pair of cold eyes were bursting with intense killing intent and confidence.

Ling Yun’s face turned paler and paler. This abnormal vision seemed to be extremely taxing on him.

However, the radiance above the strange phenomenon was extremely dazzling. That terrifying sense of heaviness was enough to crush the entire Gu City!

“Brat, go to Hell!”Ling Yun shouted as the strange phenomenon came crashing down once again!

This time, the strange phenomenon was even more powerful than before. The dazzling radiance was like a newborn sun!

“Iron Club, I’m counting on you.”Qin Yu grabbed the club tightly and his body exploded!

He held the rod with both hands and drew a beautiful arc in the air. The iron rod ruthlessly smashed towards the anomaly!

“Boom!”

At this moment, the iron rod began to display its might. Qin Yu’s divine power was perfectly displayed!

The Man and the rod seemed to have fused together, displaying a power that could destroy the heavens and earth!

Finally, the iron rod collided with the anomaly! The enormous force almost made Qin Yu lose his grip on the rod!

However, the anomaly wasn’t any better. Under the impact of the rod, the anomaly actually began to tremble and its radiance dimmed a little!

“How is this possible! ?” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

The surrounding crowd couldn’t help but Shout!

What was the origin of the rod in Qin Yu’s hand? Was that a holy weapon? Otherwise, how could it be so terrifying?

“Ah! ! !”

At this moment, Qin Yu raised his head and roared. He grabbed the rod tightly and waved it for the second time!

The veins on his body bulged, and his strength seemed to have reached its limit.

“Bang!”

Under the second swing, the anomaly trembled again, and in the next second, it was sent flying!

The anomaly flew high into the sky and exploded!

Countless beams of light shot over. The terrifying power of the explosion shattered space after space, revealing large patches of pitch-black color!

“PFFT!”

At this moment, Ling Yun couldn’t take it anymore. He spat out a mouthful of blood and took a few steps back.

The hidden injuries left behind by the heavenly demon ape, coupled with the power of Qin Yu’s club, made him extremely weak.

“Go to hell!”

Qin Yu didn’t intend to stop at this point. He used all his strength to grab the club and charge towards Ling Yun!

At this moment, the almighty beside Ling Yun made his move. He raised his golden hands to receive Qin Yu’s club.

With a bang, the Almighty was forced back a few steps. There were even traces of blood on his palms.

Clang

Qin Yu grabbed the club and slammed it onto the ground.

He looked coldly at Ling Yun, who was vomiting blood, and said, “You’ve already lost.”

Even though Qin Yu knew in his heart that Ling Yun had lost so quickly because of his internal Qi, Qin Yu couldn’t care less.

What he wanted to do was to kill Ling Yun and avenge his team leader!

Ling Yun gritted his teeth. He wanted to get up, but his aura was already extremely weak. He couldn’t fight anymore.

The almighty beside him walked out slowly.

“Do you think you’ve won? Let me tell you, you’re dead for sure today,”the Almighty said coldly.

Qin Yu sneered as well. “Let me tell you, Ling Yun Must Die today.”

“What big words!”The almighty sneered.

He looked straight at the city lord’s tower and shouted, “What are you waiting for? Take this kid down for me!”

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh

Following his angry roar, several people flew over from the city Lord’s Tower.

These people were all in the mighty realm!

Nine mighty figures looked coldly at Qin Yu.

“City Lord, I’ll lend you a half-saint weapon.”At this moment, the mighty figure spoke again.

After hearing this, a rosary fell into his hand.

Half-saint weapon!

Wisps of holy power were spreading over it.

Although this was only a half-saint weapon, the holy power could be clearly seen.

Qin Yu’s expression instantly became even uglier!

A half-saint weapon! It wasn’t something Qin Yu could resist!

Any wisp of holy power could send Qin Yu into eternal damnation!

That mighty figure held a half-saint weapon and looked coldly at Qin Yu.

“If you had lost to Young Master Ling, you might have died a quicker death. Unfortunately, you missed it,”the Almighty said coldly.

With ten almighty experts and a half-saint weapon, Qin Yu had no chance of winning at all!

“I never expected them to use a half-saint weapon...”

“There’s nothing we can do. This kid called Qin Yu defeated Ling Yun. It’s unbelievable.”

“Who is this Qin Yu? How come I’ve never heard of Him? When did such a person appear in the Southern Region?”

“I’m afraid he’s not from the southern region. Perhaps he’s from another region.”

The surrounding comments flooded in like a tide. This mighty figure held a half-saint weapon and walked toward Qin Yu step by step.

Qin Yu gripped the rod in his hand tightly. A trace of seriousness appeared on his face.

“The iron stick in my hand is no weaker than a half-saint weapon,”Qin Yu said in a low voice.

However, there was no internal Qi on the iron stick. Other than its hardness, he hadn’t found a way to activate it.

Even if the iron stick had an extraordinary origin, it was just a magic weapon that hadn’t been resurrected. It couldn’t compete with a half-saint weapon.
