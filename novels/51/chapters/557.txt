Chapter 558: The Opportunity to Become a Martial Marquis Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Qin Yu couldn’t help but frown when he sensed Gu Canghai’s powerful internal qi.

“Mr. Qin, did you... Did you succeed?” Zhen Yue asked anxiously.

Qin Yu shook his head and said regretfully, “No, I was just one step away.”

Gu Canghai narrowed his eyes as if he had guessed something.

“It seems that you won’t have the chance to become a Martial Marquis.” Gu Canghai grinned.

Qin Yu looked at Gu Canghai coldly and said, “Gu Canghai, when I become a Martial Marquis, I will personally go and destroy the Saint Confucian Sect.”

“Hahaha, it’s a pity that you won’t have the chance!” Gu Canghai shouted, and a terrifying internal qi immediately rushed over!

The internal qi was like sharp knives, leaving white marks on Qin Yu’s hard body!

In the next second, Gu Canghai’s palm turned into a claw, and grabbed at Qin Yu’s face!

Qin Yu didn’t dare to delay, and he activated the Absolute Beginning Sacred Fist before facing it head on!

The golden light streaked across the void, and ruthlessly smashed onto Gu Canghai’s finger!

“Clang!”

There was a deafening crisp sound! Under the suppression of Gu Canghai’s Martial Marquis realm, Qin Yu couldn’t help but take a few steps back!

“As expected, it’s very difficult to have any chance of winning against Martial Marquis.” Qin Yu frowned.

Gu Canghai coldly said, “Resist with all your might! Previously, you were able to escape because the Yan family wanted to spare your life!”

“Now that the battle between you and Han Wei has ended, I no longer have any scruples.”

The murderous internal qi in his entire body suddenly erupted at this moment!

Feeling the murderous internal qi in Gu Canghai’s body, Qin Yu’s expression couldn’t help but change!

“Die!” Gu Canghai roared angrily, and a huge palm instantly smashed towards Qin Yu with a powerful force!

Without any scruples, Gu Canghai’s every move was aimed at taking Qin Yu’s life!

He didn’t want to give Qin Yu any more chances. He only wanted to kill him as soon as possible so that he wouldn’t cause any more trouble.

“Bang!”

This palm was formed from pure inner strength. Its speed was extremely fast!

Qin Yu didn’t even have the time to react before this palm landed firmly on Qin Yu’s chest!

“Swoosh!”

Under this palm strike, Qin Yu’s physical body was sent flying. His chest even sank a few degrees!

A Martial Marquis’s attack was beyond imagination, and even Qin Yu’s body couldn’t resist it!

Qin Yu spat out a mouthful of blood, and several ribs were broken.

“Mr. Qin!” Zhen Yue couldn’t help but shout.

Qin Yu wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth and stood up slowly.

“Huh? He’s not dead?” Gu Canghai was a bit surprised.

One had to know that a Martial Marquis could easily kill a half-step Martial Marquis! Not to mention that this was his killing move!

“This body of yours is really beyond imagination,” Gu Canghai said with narrowed eyes.

“Qin Yu, if you are willing to serve me, I might be able to spare your life. But I guess a person like you will never submit to me,” Gu Canghai said coldly.

“So... you should just die!”

As soon as he finished his words, Gu Canghai suddenly disappeared!

In almost an instant, he arrived in front of Qin Yu!

Qin Yu’s eyes dilated, and he immediately felt that something was wrong.

He hurriedly used Shrinking Ground Into An Inch, but it was already too late!

“Go to h*ll!” Gu Canghai’s fingers curved, and he ruthlessly clawed at Qin Yu’s chest!

This claw contained almost all of Gu Canghai’s inner strength. Even a small mountain would be crushed in an instant!

“Clang!”

A crisp sound was heard. Gu Canghai immediately felt waves of pain coming from his fingers!

Looking down, he saw a mini version of a small mountain shining on Qin Yu’s chest.

“That was close...” Qin Yu hurriedly retreated. He couldn’t help but let out a sigh of relief as he dragged the Venerable Fifth Mountain in his hand.

If Gu Canghai caught him, Qin Yu’s body would probably be pierced through!

“The Venerable Fifth Mountain is really indestructible...” Qin Yu thought to himself.

On the other hand, Gu Canghai’s fingers were trembling slightly from the shock. It was extremely painful.

“Little b*stard...” Gu Canghai’s expression was cold.

His gloomy and cold eyes were filled with anger!

“I want to see what else you can do!” Gu Canghai stepped forward, and his two huge hands that were filled with surging energy pressed down ferociously!

Qin Yu didn’t dare to be negligent. He immediately used all his trump cards! His two fists quickly met the attack.

“Boom!”

However, the gap between a half-step Martial Marquis and a Martial Marquis was too big. Even though Qin Yu had the Divine Dragon Power. Under this huge gap in cultivation realm, he was still slapped to the ground!

A huge palm print was smashed on the ground. Qin Yu’s body was shattered in many places, and blood dripped down.

“Little b*stard, you’re not dead yet?” Gu Canghai’s expression turned cold. He raised his hand slightly, and his finger immediately flashed with light!

Rays of light that were like blood gathered on Gu Canghai’s finger.

In the next second, Gu Canghai’s palm stretched forward, and the ten rays of light instantly shot towards Qin Yu!

Qin Yu’s expression changed. He gritted his teeth and wanted to dodge, but the speed of the rays of light was too fast, and he couldn’t dodge in time!

“Crack!”

The ten rays of blood-red light were like sharp blades stabbing into Qin Yu’s acupuncture points!

In this instant, Qin Yu felt as if his spiritual power had been sealed, and he couldn’t use it!

“Little b*stard, let’s see what can save you today.” Gu Canghai looked at Qin Yu coldly and walked over step by step.

Qin Yu gritted his teeth and tried his best to mobilize the internal qi in his body in an attempt to break through the shackles.

Unfortunately, his spiritual power seemed to be blocked. No matter how Qin Yu struggled, he couldn’t break through! Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

When he saw that Gu Canghai had already walked over, Qin Yu’s expression became even more unsightly.

“It’s useless. I have already sealed all the vital gates of your spiritual power. No matter what, you won’t be able to escape!” Gu Canghai’s ice-cold voice rang out.

After that, Gu Canghai’s entire body shone with light, and terrifying murderous internal qi condensed on his palms!

“Little b*stard, you’ve killed hundreds of people from Saint Confucian Sect. Because of you, President Yan is already displeased with me! You b*stard!” Gu Canghai said through gritted teeth.

Qin Yu raised his head to look at Gu Canghai and grinned. “Old b*stard, you deserve it...”

“You’re courting death!” Gu Canghai was instantly enraged. His large palm immediately smashed down fiercely towards Qin Yu!

“Slap!”

This strike was extremely powerful. Qin Yu felt as if his internal organs were about to be smashed into pieces as a mouthful of blood gushed out!

“I’ll see how long you can keep your mouth shut!” Gu Canghai roared furiously.

His palm contained a suppressive force that was like a mountain as it ruthlessly smashed towards Qin Yu!

Once, twice, thrice...

Qin Yu’s body was instantly covered in bloody scars and many of his bones were shattered!

However, Gu Canghai still didn’t show any signs of stopping. He kept smashing Qin Yu’s body with his palms.

In just a few seconds, Qin Yu’s body was almost smashed into pieces.

His consciousness started to blur, and a sense of fatigue arose.

“Mr. Qin...” Zhen Yue couldn’t help but sob softly when she saw this scene.

Qin Yu opened his mouth slightly, and everything in front of him became a little hazy.

“D*mn it... the realm of the Martial Marquis... as expected, I can’t overcome it...” Qin Yu muttered inside.

“I can’t even use my secret technique... am I really going to die here today...”

“Ruoxue, I... I’ve disappointed you...”

Following Gu Canghai’s attack, Qin Yu’s consciousness became increasingly blurry. He couldn’t even feel pain anymore.

The scenes of the past flashed through Qin Yu’s mind.

At this moment, Qin Yu thought of many things. These random flashbacks made it seem like he was on the brink of death.

“I seem to have thought of something...” On the brink of death, a crazy thought suddenly appeared in Qin Yu’s mind!

“I know how to step into the Martial Marquis realm...!”

His eyes, which had already dimmed, were now filled with determination!

“I know!” Qin Yu shouted excitedly inside!
