Several beautiful women in Cheongsam exhaled into Qin Yu’s ear like orchids.

That seductive internal Qi filled the entire room.

Qin Yu’s body trembled slightly, and these women were immediately forced back a few steps.

“Pavilion Master Luo, there’s no need for that. Let them go out first,”Qin Yu said expressionlessly.

Luo Jingyu said with some surprise, “What? Mr. Qin doesn’t like it? Why don’t we change the batch?”

“There’s no need.”Qin Yu walked straight to the table and sat down.

Seeing this, Luo Jingyu didn’t ask for trouble anymore.

He poured a glass of wine for Qin Yu and said with a smile, “Mr. Qin, we can be considered to have gotten to know each other without fighting. This glass of wine is for you. I hope we can become friends in the future!”

Qin Yu raised his cup and downed it in one go.

After drinking a cup of wine, Luo Jingyu said somewhat impatiently, “Mr. Qin, did you bring that ring?”

“Of course.”Qin Yu said with a smile.

Luo Jingyu suppressed the excitement in his heart and said, “Mr. Qin, that ring is quite important to me. If it’s convenient, please return it to Me First.”

Qin Yu smiled and said, “What’s the secret of this ring? Why is pavilion master Luo so nervous?”

Luo Jingyu pretended to sigh and said, “There’s no secret to this ring. It’s just that it’s a token of my love with my wife, so I can’t lose it.”

Qin Yu said in surprise, “I didn’t expect pavilion master Luo to be such a sentimental person.”

“Mr. Qin, you must be joking. Then you see...”Luo Jingyu rubbed his hands, looking a little anxious.

Qin Yu took out the brocade box from his pocket.

He handed the brocade box to Luo Jingyu and said, “The ring is in here. Take it, pavilion master Luo.”

Luo Jingyu snatched the brocade box and opened it anxiously.

Seeing the ring inside, Luo Jingyu immediately heaved a sigh of relief.

“Pavilion Master Luo, is there a problem?”Qin Yu said with a smile.

Luo Jingyu counted with a faint smile, “No problem, but Mr. Qin, I’m afraid there’s something wrong with you.”

Qin Yu put down the chopsticks in his hand and raised his eyebrows, “Pavilion master luo, what do you mean by that?”

Luo Jingyu had yet to speak when Luo Yang, who was at the side, slammed the table and stood up!

He pointed at Qin Yu’s nose and said, “Qin Yu! Do you really think we want to be friends with you? Why Don’t you take a look at yourself in the mirror? Do You Think You’re Worthy? !”

“You hit me and stole our things. Do you think this matter will be settled just like that? !”

Qin Yu’s eyes narrowed slightly. He looked at Luo Jingyu coldly and said, “Pavilion Master Luo, is that what you mean too?”

Luo Jingyu didn’t answer this question. Instead, he smiled faintly and said, “Qin Yu, return my magic artifact. Perhaps I can spare your life.”

Seeing this, Qin Yu couldn’t help but laugh out loud. “As expected, what kind of son you have is what kind of father you have.”

Luo Jingyu said with a sneer, “Is it still useful for you to say these things now? Return the magic weapon. At least you will suffer less physical pain.”

“Just the two of you?”Qin Yu said coldly.

Luo Jingyu wasn’t in a hurry. He clapped his hands, and immediately, several martial marquises rushed out.

They held the magic artifacts of the pavilion of heavenly secrets in their hands, and they looked extraordinary.

“Even if we add them, it won’t work.”Qin Yu shook his head and said.

Luo Jingyu said indifferently, “Qin Yu, I know that your subordinates have some ability, but if I don’t do a complete plan, how could I shed all pretense of cordiality with you?”

Luo Yang, who was at the side, laughed loudly and said, “Qin Yu! The wine you drank just now was poisoned long ago! If I’m not wrong, you should have lost all your internal energy by now!”

Qin Yu didn’t say anything. He stared at the wine in front of him and couldn’t help but sigh slightly.

“Should I say that you guys are stupid or that you guys are smart?”Qin Yu shook his head helplessly.

Luo jingyu frowned and said, “What do you mean by that?”

Qin Yu slowly stood up and said, “If you guys are honest with each other, I’m willing to return this ring. After all, I was the one who snatched it, but you guys chose a troublesome and Wrong Path.”

Luo Jingyu snorted coldly and said, “So what? The ring is now in my hands!”

Qin Yu sneered and said, “You made preparations. Don’t tell me that I didn’t make preparations?”

“Open the brocade box and take a look. Is that your ring?”

Upon hearing this, Luo Jingyu’s expression changed greatly!

He hurriedly opened the brocade box and carefully observed it!

Only at this moment did he realize that this ring was actually fake! A high-quality imitation!

“You... you dare to lie to me? !”Luo Jingyu instantly flew into a rage!

Qin Yu sneered and said, “I predicted that you would lose your mind due to excitement and wouldn’t carefully observe it. As expected, it’s just as I expected.”

Luo Jingyu gnashed his teeth and said, “Return the ring to me, or I’ll kill you!”

Qin Yu sighed again.

“Pavilion Master Luo, your brain doesn’t seem to work,”Qin Yu said with a cold smile.

He shook the wine cup in front of him and said with a cold smile, “Do you think I won’t notice that you poisoned the elders of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion?”

As he spoke, Qin Yu opened his mouth and spat out all the wine!

Luo Jingyu’s expression changed drastically again! He gritted his teeth and countless expressions flashed across his face.

A moment later, Luo Jingyu suddenly laughed out loud, “Qin Yu, I was just joking with you. Why Are You So Serious? Hurry up and sit down!”

Qin Yu mocked, “Look, your brain is really not good. It’s acting up again.”

“You!”Luo Jingyu’s expression was extremely gloomy.

He said coldly, “Qin Yu, you better hand over that ring, or I won’t let you off!”

Qin Yu’s face instantly turned extremely cold.

“Pavilion Master Luo, I seem to have contracted a disease recently,”Qin Yu said coldly. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“I don’t know what’s wrong with me, but I can’t restrain the killing intent in my heart, and I especially want to kill someone...”

Before he finished speaking, Qin Yu suddenly stretched out his hand and crushed the head of a martial marquis!

Such speed made people speechless!

Even Luo Jingyu was shocked!

“Luo Jingyu, thank you for the Magic Tool and... Golden Core!”
