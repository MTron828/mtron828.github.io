Chapter 1233: Chapter 1,233, a strange bottomless abyss 

Qin Yu was staying in a hotel on Deer Emperor Island. He looked at the treasures placed in front of him and couldn’t help but sigh in his heart.

“What does this deer emperor want to do?”Qin Yu rubbed his forehead, feeling a headache.

Di zun said, “This deer emperor is a standard person who steps on the ground and climbs up. As long as he has the strength, he wants to rope in his own lineup.”

“It is precisely because of this that deer emperor island has been able to endure for so long.”

Qin Yu suddenly realized that this was a pretty good method.

If anything happened to Deer Emperor Island’s experts, they only needed to wave their arms and there would be reinforcements.

Of course, Deer Emperor wasn’t the first to do this. In fact, many top aristocratic families and sects would do the same thing.

For example, the guest elders were powerful external helpers.

At this moment, there was another knock on the door.

After the door opened, deer emperor walked in with steady steps.

“Little Friend Qin.”As soon as Deer Emperor entered the door, he greeted Qin Yu with a smile.

Qin Yu nodded slightly, and then went straight to the point, “Mr. Deer, did you find the array flag?”

“Hahaha, I didn’t.”Lu Huang waved his hand. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“Although I don’t have the formation flag, I think you’ll be interested in what I have.”

Qin Yu looked Lu Huang Up and down and said with a smile, “I only want to step into the Holy Region now. Apart from the formation flag, I really don’t know anything that can interest me.”

Lu Huang was not in a hurry. He smiled and said, “Little Friend Qin, why don’t you follow me to take a look?”

Qin Yu thought for a moment. After all, he had nothing to lose.

Moreover, he was not afraid of what Lu Huang would do. In the current era, Qin Yu was not afraid of anyone.

Therefore, he stood up and said, “Okay, then I’ll go with you.”

Lu Huang’s eyes flashed with joy. He immediately stood up and led the way, leaving the hotel.

After getting into Deer Emperor’s car, the two of them rushed into his castle.

On the way, deer emperor said, “Young friend Qin, you have such abilities at such a young age. It’s really shocking.”

Qin Yu did not want to waste time with him and said bluntly, “Deer Emperor, I will soon head to the Holy Region. I Can’t stay here for too long. It’s meaningless for you to waste your time on me.”

Deer Emperor looked at Qin Yu and said indifferently, “It’s a golden era now. This is news that almost everyone knows. Little Friend Qin, do you really think that under the background of the golden era, Earth can stay out of trouble?”

Qin Yu was stunned. He looked at Deer Emperor in surprise.

It had to be said that Qin Yu had indeed thought about this question raised by Deer Emperor, but he did not think too much about it.

However, after being reminded by the Deer Emperor recently, Qin Yu also had a strong feeling.

That’s right. Throughout history, every golden age would give birth to countless talents.

They had the ability to fly through the sky and the Earth. They could cross the galaxy and travel through the void.

It was not an exaggeration to say that almost nothing could stop their footsteps.

And earth was an ancient star.

This ancient star seemed to have been completely explored, but in fact, different realms saw different worlds.

Perhaps what Qin Yu and the others saw was only the surface of Earth’s resources.

At that time, there would definitely be top experts stepping into earth.

“I’m not investing in the present, but in the future,”Lu Huang said faintly.

Qin Yu glanced at Lu Huang and said, “It seems that you haven’t lived in vain for more than a thousand years.”

His words were somewhat offensive, but Lu Huang still didn’t care.

He laughed and said, “More than a thousand years have long allowed me to see through everything in the world.”

As they spoke, the two of them had already arrived at the castle.

Lu Huang personally opened the carriage door for Qin Yu and brought him into the castle.

Because Qin Yu didn’t have any spiritual power, he couldn’t sense how many experts were around deer emperor, nor could he sense what treasures were hidden in the castle.

He followed behind Deer Emperor, passing through the castle and arriving at an isolated island behind him.

This place was like a different world.

It was only separated by a wall, but it was completely different.

Outside, it was a bustling city; inside, it was desolate and deserted.

Deer Emperor led Qin Yu and continued to move forward.

The two of them walked for several kilometers. Soon, Qin Yu saw a huge pitch-black pit in the distance.

This pit was pure black. At a glance, it looked like a black hole.

There was a deathly stillness in it. There were no fluctuations of internal Qi. It was as if this place was nothing.

Lu Huang brought Qin Yu to the pit and stopped in front of it.

He pointed at the huge pit and said, “This is the greatest treasure I have. I have named it the Bottomless Abyss.”

Staring at the Bottomless Abyss, Qin Yu’s eyes were filled with shock.

This was different from anything he had ever seen. It was as if after stepping into this black hole, one would disappear into nothingness, or rather, turn into nothingness.

The feeling of shock from the bottom of one’s heart was indescribable. It surpassed all the Sacred Feelings Qin Yu felt! Just looking at this black hole made one feel breathless!

“What exactly is this bottomless abyss?”Qin Yu raised his head and looked at Deer Emperor.

Deer Emperor shook his head and said, “From the moment I came to Deer Emperor Island, the bottomless Abyss has already existed. And in this abyss, there will occasionally appear some rare treasures in the world.”

“For example, the Purple Jade origin snake that you killed came from this bottomless abyss.”

“And the coiling dragon lock that was shattered by you also came from the Bottomless Abyss.”

Deer Emperor paused for a moment and then said with some emotion, “The purple jade origin snake has the bloodline of the ancient fierce beasts, and the coiling dragon lock is also not a product of this era.”
