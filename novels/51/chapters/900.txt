Chapter 901: Chapter 901, the person who had become a martial saint

“More resources?”Li Yu frowned even more.

He did not seem to understand.

Was such a huge secret realm not enough for cultivation?

If other people had obtained such a secret realm, they would have to enter closed door cultivation for several years, right?

Qin Yu saw Li Yu’s confusion. He waved his hand and said, “I can’t explain it to you, but during this period of time... I’m very grateful to you. To be honest, I didn’t believe you at first.”

“I never thought I would help you. I was just wavering between you and master.”Li Yu did not hide anything.

Qin Yu smiled and said, “Speaking of which, there’s something I’m very curious about. Why would you want to kill your master?”

A trace of viciousness flashed in Li Yu’s eyes. He gritted his teeth and said, “Because he’s a sinister and cunning person!”

“In fact, he is sinister and cunning. It has nothing to do with me, but... he stole my woman! This old pervert, I love that Woman!”

Speaking of which, Li Yu gritted his teeth in hatred.

Seeing this, Qin Yu could not help but laugh, “I didn’t expect you to be a lover.”

Li Yu snorted lightly and said, “This is also the reason why I chose to help you and not my master.”

“I understand.”Qin Yu patted Li Yu’s shoulder.

“When I get out, I will kill him for you.”

Li Yu nodded and said, “Be careful.”

After bidding farewell to Li Yu, Qin Yu left this secret realm.

He knew very well that this time, he would definitely be found. It was only a matter of time.

With Qin Yu’s current strength, the chances of him defeating a martial saint were still very slim.

Therefore, there were only two paths before him. One was to find a way to change his appearance, and the other was to possess the ability to escape.

Qin Yu had made up his mind. After he left the mystic realm, he would go to the divine medicine pavilion to look for the pavilion master. Then, he would find Jiang he and learn the nine secrets.

In this way, Qin Yu at least had the ability to save his life.

After leaving the Mystic Realm, Qin Yu smelled a pungent bloody smell.

This smell immediately caused Qin Yu’s expression to change slightly.

He rubbed his nose, then his eyes looked around.

The first thing that entered his eyes was a dried up spiritual spring in front of him.

After the gap was repaired, the spirit spring quickly dried up.

And at this moment, the spirit spring was stained with blood.

Qin Yu immediately had a bad premonition.

“What a thick smell of blood... and even yin qi!”Qin Yu’s expression couldn’t help but change.

He hurriedly walked forward.

Arriving at the square of Bi Yue villa, Qin Yu’s expression instantly turned extremely ugly!

Looking at the corpses and dried up blood all over the ground, Qin Yu’s body couldn’t help but tremble slightly!

“Who did it...”Qin Yu clenched his fists, his heart filled with grief.

“I’m the one who implicated all of you...”Qin Yu’s body trembled slightly.

He had thought that these people would be hurt because of him, but Qin Yu still had a sliver of hope in his heart. That was that they would leave the BI Yue villa.

The current situation indicated that the entire green moon Villa’s people were all dead!

Qin Yu took a deep breath. He suppressed the anger in his heart and said in a low voice, “Don’t worry, I will definitely take revenge for you, I will definitely...”

At this moment, Qin Yu suddenly thought of something!

His expression changed, and he said in a low voice, “It’s bad, the Divine Alchemist Pavilion!”

If the medicine God Pavilion was also harmed because of this, then Qin Yu would not be able to accept it!

He did not dare to think too much and quickly rushed towards the medicine God Pavilion.

It had been three months since Qin Yu had disappeared. The many martial saints were no longer as diligent in searching for Qin Yu.

Plus, Qin Yu had concealed his internal Qi. Thus, he had successfully arrived at the Medicine God Pavilion.

After arriving at the Medicine God Pavilion, Qin Yu could not help but heave a sigh of relief when he saw the calm medicine God Pavilion. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

He quickly walked into the Divine Alchemist Pavilion and went straight to the Pavilion Master’s building.

“Who is it? !”

Qin Yu’s sudden intrusion immediately made the pavilion master extremely vigilant.

The internal Qi on her body erupted and she arrived in front of Qin Yu in the blink of an eye.

“It’s me,”Qin Yu said in a low voice.

The Pavilion Master was first stunned when she saw Qin Yu before she quickly pulled Qin Yu into the secret chamber.

Arriving at the Secret Chamber, the pavilion master hurriedly closed the secret chamber.

This secret chamber was made of special materials, so the internal Qi would not be leaked out. Therefore, the pavilion master also slightly heaved a sigh of relief.

“Why are you here? Don’t you know that they are all looking for you?”The pavilion master said with a reproachful tone.

Qin Yu did not answer this question, but asked, “After I left, they did not come to look for you, right?”

The Pavilion Master was silent for a moment. Then, he shook his head and said, “No.”

“That’s good.”Qin Yu heaved a sigh of relief.

After that, Qin Yu told the pavilion master about his experience in the mystic realm.

After the pavilion master heard this, he couldn’t help but say with some surprise, “You’re saying... someone who seems to be at the Almighty Realm has taken Yan Ruoxue Away?”

Qin Yu acknowledged and said in a low voice, “I don’t know who they are. Lord Pavilion Master, is there any news from the outside world?”

The pavilion master shook his head and said, “No, but even if someone really took Yan ruoxue away, they wouldn’t say anything.”

This was the truth. No matter which organization or faction obtained Yan Ruoxue, they would probably choose to keep it a secret.

“However... at the moment, there shouldn’t be any faction that has the Almighty Realm.”At this time, the pavilion master changed the topic.

“If anyone has the Almighty Realm, then they will definitely be above any faction in the current era. The Jingdu Martial Arts Association also has no power to contend with them.”

Qin Yu nodded and sighed, “I hope so.”

Then, the pavilion master explained the current situation to Qin Yu.

After the pavilion master’s explanation, Qin Yu learned that the person who had entered the martial saint realm was not the current genius, but a veteran half-step martial saint.

This half-step martial saint was called Xu Huaigu. He could be said to be a late bloomer. He was in the same generation as Jiang he, Ye Qing, and the pavilion master. However, he had been suppressed by ye Qing and the others.

Almost everyone had already forgotten about this veteran half-step martial saint. However, no one had expected that he would be the first to step into the martial saint realm.
