Chapter 1607: Chapter 1607, Wen Wanji and Yongji 1 Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

The newcomer was dressed in white and looked quite old. His entire body was exuding an extremely powerful internal Qi.

This person was none other than Wen Wanji, who had disappeared for a long time!

Wen Wanji’s eyes were wide open in anger and his face was filled with ferocity. He stared at Yongji as if he wanted to eat him up.

“Wen Wanji?”Yongji was also a little surprised when he saw the newcomer.

Wen Wanji said with a dark face, “I knew that you are not a good B * stard. As expected, you are indeed a beast!”

Yong Ji laughed out loud and said, “I thought you were already dead. I didn’t expect you to still be alive. Why? Do you want me to send you off?”

Wen wanji sneered and said, “As Qin Yu’s master, I naturally have to fight for him. B * stard, when I saw your hypocritical look, I was filled with anger. I have long wanted to meet you!”

His foul language made Yongji extremely displeased.

He said with a black face, “Wen Wanji, you weren’t my match back then, and now you’re even worse. I’m Warning You, you better watch your mouth!”

“I’ll watch my f * cking Big Hammer. With Your F * cking look, do I have to be polite with you?”Wen Wanji cursed.

The veins on Yong Ji’s forehead bulged, and his whole body emitted a strong chill.

“Wen Wanji, I’ll tear your F * cking mouth apart!”Yong Ji said through gritted teeth.

Wen Wanji laughed loudly and said, “Then come on, you son of a B * Tch. I’ll shove your head into your asshole!”

“You’re courting death!”Finally, Yong Ji couldn’t hold it in anymore. He reached out his palm and grabbed Wen Wanji.

Wen Wanji dodged to the side.

He looked at Xiao Hai’s grave not far away and said coldly, “Do you dare to come to another place?”

“Why wouldn’t I Dare!”Yong Ji said angrily.

“Okay, then let’s go to Xingnan village,”Wen Wanji said with a smile.

Yong Ji’s expression immediately became colder.

This Xingan village was Yong Ji’s former residence. His parents were buried in Xingnan village.

It was obvious that Wen Wanji was deliberately trying to disgust Yongji.

Yongji took a deep breath and said, “Fine, so what if it’s Xing ‘Nan Village!”

“Fine, I’ll go to the F * cking grave and wait for you,”Wen Wanji said while grimacing.

After saying this, Wen Wanji turned around and left.

Yongji was so angry that his entire body was trembling. He clenched his fists and immediately chased after Wen Wanji.

But at that moment, a black-robed man rushed to Yong Ji’s side.

He blocked Yong Ji’s path and whispered, “Something happened.”

“If anything happens, I will kill Wen Wanji First!”Yong Ji said through gritted teeth.

The black-robed man frowned and whispered into Yong Ji’s ear, “Rui Yi has been captured. Her life is unknown. She is a trusted aide of the god King. We must ensure her safety.”

Hearing this, the furious Yong Ji finally calmed down a little.

He resisted the urge to kill Wen Wanyi and turned to look at the black-robed man.

“Who captured Rui Yi?”Yong Ji asked coldly.

“Teng Sect’s sect leader, he teng,”the black-robed man said.

Yong Ji frowned slightly and whispered, “He Teng? Isn’t he the target of our cooperation? How could he...”

“I’m not sure either, but I’m sure that Rui Yi must have ruined it,”the black-robed man said in a low voice.

“Rui Yi has never left the northern lands. She has always been by the four godly monarchs’side. She has long been spoiled. How would she know the dangers of the outside world?”Yong Ji snorted.

The black-robed man nodded slightly, as if agreeing with Yong Ji.

“Let’s go to Teng men,”Yong Ji said coldly.

He did not stay, turning around and leaving.

The people around them all heaved a sigh of relief when they saw this.

“Phew, it’s fortunate that Wen Wanye is here. Otherwise, we might really have died here today,”someone said softly.

“I have to say, Wen Wanye is still the same as always, full of foul language.”

“Yeah, but I don’t know why, but hearing him swear this time feels pretty good.”

...

Wen Wanli stood high up in the sky and coldly looked down at everything.

He naturally didn’t go to Yongji’s parents’grave. The reason he said those words was to deliberately provoke Yongji.

“I didn’t expect even Xiao Hai to fall...”Wen Wanli muttered in a low voice.

His expression was gloomy, and he felt a little sad in his heart.

In the vast southern region, Wen wanji only admired two people.

One was Jue Wu, and the other was Xiao Hai.

Although he was not one of the three madmen, he had never been convinced by Eternal Pole Baro and the others.

“The north is already so crazy.”Wen Wanji looked at the black-robed man slaughtering below, and a trace of viciousness flashed through his eyes.

After that, his figure shot down explosively.

...

Teng men.

Yong Ji and the black-robed man came to this place.

He sat opposite he teng and said with a faint smile, “I didn’t expect sect leader he to be so young. I really admire you.”

He Teng said with a sinister tone, “Mister Yong Ji, you don’t have to say such polite words to me. You and I aren’t good people. Let’s get straight to the point...”

Yong Ji was stunned for a moment before he laughed and said, “I like to deal with smart people. To be honest, the northern lands does intend to cooperate with you.”

“Oh? Cooperate or recruit?”He Teng said sinisterly.

Yong Ji smiled faintly and said, “Of course it’s cooperation. To be honest, our first choice is the Tianyun sect, but unfortunately, the Tianyun sect doesn’t know what’s good for them.”

“It’s very obvious that you’re much smarter than the Tianyun sect.”

He Teng said with a sinister tone, “Then your northern lands should let me see sincerity...”

Yong Ji said with a faint smile, “Sect leader he, you took away three of our paintings. Isn’t this considered sincerity?”

“That was snatched by me, not given by you. What does it have to do with you?”He Teng said with a sneer.

Hearing this, a trace of dissatisfaction flashed across Yong Ji’s face.

Damn it, why was this he teng even more shameless than him?

“Then I wonder what kind of sincerity you want, sir.”Yong Ji suppressed his anger and said.

He Teng suddenly stood up. He squinted his eyes and said, “It’s very simple. Find a way to let me go to the northern lands. That’s enough.”

“Go to the northern lands?”Yong Ji was stunned. He could not believe his ears.

“May I know why you are going to the northern lands?”

He Teng said darkly, “Then you don’t have to ask. This is my business...”

Yong Ji fell into silence. He did not say anything for a long time.

“It seems that Mr. Yong Ji doesn’t have any right to speak. It’s better to find someone who can make the decision to talk to me,”he teng said with a smile.

“The person who has the right to speak has been arrested by you,”the black-robed man next to him said. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Oh? You mean that woman?”He Teng was slightly surprised.

Yong ji nodded and said, “Sect leader of he sect, Rui Yi, please return it to us.”

“No problem...”he teng waved his hand, and soon Rui Yi was brought up.

Rui Yi, who was lying on the ground, had already been tortured beyond recognition. She seemed to have lost consciousness, rolling her eyes and twitching non-stop.
