Chapter 886: Chapter 886, you’re F * cking... Courting Death! 

The youth’s expression immediately darkened.

He narrowed his eyes and said, “Back then, with old Mister Yan protecting you, no one in Jingdu dared to provoke you. But now, Old Mister Yan is already dead! The Yan family won’t care about you, so what right do you have to follow me...”

Before he could finish speaking, he felt a chill run down his back.

He turned around and saw Qin Yu standing behind him.

“You... You Are Qin Yu?”The youth braced himself and asked.

Qin Yu put his hand on his shoulder and said with a smile, “Let’s talk somewhere else.”

The youth seemed to sense that something was wrong. He immediately berated, “I know you have some ability, but let me tell you, I am Cao Rui of the fourth young master of Jingdu. If you dare to touch me...”

“Pa!”

Before Cao Rui could finish his words, his body flew out.

“Cao Rui? The fourth young master of Jingdu? What is that?”Qin Yu looked coldly at Cao Rui.

Cao Rui hurriedly got up from the ground. He angrily said, “You are just a martial artist, and you actually dare to fight with me. You... you just wait and see!”

Qin Yu walked step by step towards Cao Rui. As he walked, he said, “I remember that old Mister Yan made the Sun family disappear overnight. Today, I will imitate him and make your Cao family disappear.”

Although Qin Yu’s voice was not loud, it was enough to reach the ears of everyone around him.

“Make my Cao family disappear? hahahaha! You are just a martial artist!”Cao Rui did not know that danger was coming. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Qin Yu bent down and sneered. “Go back and tell your father that either you leave Jingdu immediately, or I will send you all away.”

Cao Rui got up from the ground and pointed at Qin Yu. “Alright, just you wait. We’ll see!”

With that, Cao Rui left in a hurry.

The people around couldn’t help but look over.

There was no lack of business elites and officials among these people, but no one said anything at the moment.

After chasing Cao Rui away, Qin Yu sat next to Yan Ruoxue.

“Are You Alright?”Qin Yu smiled.

Yan Ruoxue said with some amusement, “You’re getting braver and braver now.”

Qin Yu also said jokingly, “Of course, I’m Super Braver Now!”

“TSK!”Yan Ruoxue rolled her eyes at Qin Yu with a smile.

At this moment, Qin Yu felt a powerful internal Qi rapidly approaching.

Qin Yu frowned slightly and suddenly looked in a certain direction at the door.

He saw several people appearing at the door! Among them, the leader was none other than Gu Xinghe!

There were four half-step martial saints beside Gu Xinghe, and Wan Guqiong was also among them.

“Gu Xinghe...”before Qin Yu could speak, Yan Ruoxue whispered this name.

Qin Yu frowned and asked, “You know him?”

“Yes.”Yan ruoxue nodded.

“When I was in the second secret area, he absorbed a large part of my blood. I heard that he is the young master of the second secret area, a first-rate genius.”

Hearing this, a trace of anger flashed across Qin Yu’s face.

Soon, Gu Xinghe brought a few people and walked towards Qin Yu.

“Miss Yan, have you been living happily outside recently? Do you miss the life in the Second Mystic Realm?”As Gu Xinghe approached, his gaze immediately fell on Yan Ruoxue.

A trace of pain flashed across Yan Ruoxue’s face. Although she forced a smile, she was still seen through at a glance.

“Miss Yan, don’t worry. I’ll bring you back to the second mystic realm soon. hahaha!”Gu Xinghe laughed provocatively.

“Boom!”

At this moment, Qin Yu suddenly threw a punch!

This time, Gu Xinghe was prepared. He suddenly retreated and dodged.

Then, Gu Xinghe came to Qin Yu’s side again.

“What, are you angry now?”Gu Xinghe sneered.

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and said, “Gu Xinghe, you really forgot about the pain after you recovered...”

When this matter was brought up, Gu Xinghe’s expression became a little ugly.

“Qin Yu, don’t be arrogant too early. In a few days, the second secret realm will send a martial saint.”Gu Xinghe sneered.

Qin Yu stood up and said, “Before the martial saint appears, I can kill you a hundred times.”

As he spoke, Qin Yu’s body emitted a strong murderous aura.

“It’s so cold...”

This murderous aura instantly engulfed the entire Zhuang family, and the temperature dropped by a few degrees at this moment.

Gu Xinghe snorted lightly and said, “Qin Yu, I’m afraid you can’t kill me by yourself.”

As he said this, he looked at Wan Gu Qiong and the others beside him.

“They all came from the secret realm and have a deep hatred towards you. They also have the intention to send a martial saint to kill you,”Gu Xinghe said lightly.

“Wan Gu Qiong! You’re actually hanging out with Gu Xinghe!”When Yao Meng saw this, she could not help but shout in a tender voice.

Wan Gu Qiong glanced at Yao Meng and said coldly, “We have common interests.”

“You!”Yao Meng pointed at Wan Guqiong and gnashed her teeth in anger.

Qin Yu could not help but sneer, “Not bad, not bad at all. Wan guqiong, when I become a martial saint, Your Wan family will be the first to be destroyed.”

Although it was only a simple sentence, it made Wan Guqiong’s face flash with a trace of panic.

Although this panic was fleeting, it still could not escape Qin Yu’s eyes.

“Qin Yu, you are only at the perfect stage of the Martial Marquis Realm. You are still far away from becoming a martial saint. I’m afraid you won’t have the chance,”Wan Gu Qiong said coldly.

Qin Yu sneered, “Then we’ll just wait and see.”

Wan Gu Qiong did not say anything more and stood silently behind Gu Xinghe.

Gu Xinghe raised his brows and said, “Qin Yu, you should know in your heart that it’s impossible for you to step into the martial saint realm in a few short days.”

“And once the martial saint is Born, you won’t be able to protect Yan Ruoxue. Yan Ruoxue will have to return to the second secret realm to suffer.”

When he said this, Gu Xinghe changed the topic and raised his eyebrows, “If you really care about her, you might as well give her to me. With my protection, at least she will suffer less.”

After he finished speaking, the people around Gu Xinghe burst into laughter.

“How about it? Do you want to consider it? You Can’t be too selfish,”gu xinghe continued to ridicule.

“TSK tsk, the suffering of the second secret realm is really hard to imagine. I’ve tried it before, but it only lasted for less than a minute.”

“And Yan Ruoxue has to suffer this kind of torture all the time. Sigh, it hurts just thinking about it...”

Gu Xinghe’s words made Qin Yu lose his mind instantly.

His eyes were bloodshot as he growled in a low voice, “You’re F * cking courting death!”
