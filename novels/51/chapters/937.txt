Chapter 938: Chapter 938, Immortal Crane’s request 

At this moment, the aura of the internal Qi of the divine dragon spread rapidly.

When everyone saw the Divine Dragon Mark between Qin Yu’s brows, they all retreated.

Even Immortal Crane’s brows furrowed slightly.

At this moment, Qin Yu seemed to have understood something!

He couldn’t help but recall the scene when little black saw the power of the Divine Dragon!

These demon beasts seemed to be very afraid of the power of the Divine Dragon!

“Haha!”Qin Yu could not help but laugh coldly, and then he swept his gaze toward the crowd.

But the immortal crane not far away only frowned, and then continued to walk toward Qin Yu.

Qin Yu’s expression immediately changed greatly!

This immortal crane actually overcame the suppression of the bloodline in such a short time?

Very quickly, the immortal crane arrived in front of Qin Yu.

His entire body was surging with energy, and his elegant posture contained the most powerful power.

Qin Yu did not dare to be negligent. He could only raise his remaining internal Qi to the limit and meet the immortal crane head-on!

Unfortunately, even at his peak, Qin Yu could not threaten the immortal crane, let alone now?

The Immortal Crane only shook its arms and pushed Qin Yu back!

Before Qin Yu could get up, the immortal crane’s huge hand had already slapped down.

A terrifying power poured down on Qin Yu’s body. Qin Yu only felt a blackness in front of him before he fainted.

...

When Qin Yu woke up, he was already locked in a prison. Beside him was a handlebar mustache.

“F * ck.”Qin Yu couldn’t help but curse in his heart.

He had barged into the city of a Demon Beast! T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

The handlebar mustache was still not awake. Qin Yu couldn’t help but walk forward to check on his injuries.

But when Qin Yu walked closer, he heard the faint snoring of the handlebar mustache.

He was actually asleep! He slept quite soundly!

“Why are you so big-hearted!”Qin Yu couldn’t help but kick his butt.

The handlebar mustache turned over and fell asleep again in a daze.

Qin Yu had no choice but to pull his ears and pull him up.

The handlebar mustache, who had been pulled awake, looked around in a daze.

“What’s the situation?”The handlebar mustache rubbed his sleepy eyes.

Qin Yu said with a dark face, “We were caught by a demonic beast.”

Hearing this, the handlebar mustache instantly remembered.

His pupils constricted, and he said in a low voice, “Oh No, oh no, this is really F * cking bad luck!”

“Is there any way to escape?”Qin Yu asked.

The mustached man was just about to take the spirit stones when he shook his head and said, “No, this entire city has been set up with a formation. Even spiritual sense can’t penetrate it, let alone a formation.”

Qin Yu couldn’t help but frown slightly.

He thought for a long time, but still couldn’t find a good solution.

At this moment, two people walked over from outside.

They patted the prison’s door and said, “Lord Xianhe wants to see you.”

“It’s over. He’s going to execute us,”the man with the handlebar mustache said with a face full of grief and indignation.

“I didn’t expect that this venerable self, who has lived a life of debauchery, would actually fall to such a state. I’m not resigned!”

“Enough, stop talking nonsense.”The two people frowned.

Qin Yu was rather calm.

If the immortal crane wanted to kill them, it would have made a move long ago. There was no need to lock the two people up.

Since they were spared, there was room for maneuver.

Qin Yu and the handlebar mustache followed behind them. They went in circles all the way through the forest and streams, and finally came to a mountain range,

this place was like a paradise. Everything around it was made of mountain rocks.

There were fat fruits on the leaves, and in the cave, there was fine wine.

Looking at the smoke-filled environment, Qin Yu was a little absent-minded for a moment, thinking that he had arrived at a fairyland.

On a stone bed in front, the immortal crane was lying on its side, holding a jade pot in its hand. The pot was filled with dew-like nectar.

“Lord Crane, here they are,”said the two men.

The crane gestured for them to stand down.

“Crane Lord, spare our lives, I have a secret treasure, can give you!”The handlebar mustache ran to say.

But before he could get close to the crane, he was pushed back.

Qin Yu looked at the crane coldly, looking extremely calm.

The Immortal Crane did not speak for a long time. It was tasting the fine wine. Its long and narrow eyes were slightly closed, and the mighty wind blew past its long white hair. It looked quite beautiful.

“Aren’t you afraid?”After finishing a bottle of wine, the immortal crane finally opened its eyes and looked at Qin Yu.

Qin Yu was neither servile nor overbearing. He said calmly, “I don’t think you will kill us. You just want something from us.”

The Immortal Crane looked at Qin Yu coldly and said, “What can you give me?”

“I don’t know,”Qin Yu said expressionlessly.

The Immortal Crane sat down on the jade bed. He slowly stood up and walked toward Qin Yu.

That powerful aura couldn’t help but make people shiver.

A terrifying pressure spread out.

But even so, Qin Yu didn’t move at all. He looked at the immortal crane calmly.

Their eyes met, and the atmosphere froze for a moment.

Qin Yu’s heart was extremely calm. In an extremely short period of time, he had filtered through everything that he had.

After thinking about it, the only thing that could catch the crane’s eye was probably the power of the Divine Dragon.

It was almost impossible to forcefully seize the power of the Divine Dragon.

“Where did you get the power of the Divine Dragon?”

At this moment, the immortal crane finally spoke.

He turned around and returned to his jade bed, casually picking up a pot of fine wine.

Qin Yu heaved a sigh of relief.

It was just as he had guessed.

Thus, he told the immortal crane about the process of the power of the Divine Dragon.

After the immortal crane heard it, it said quietly, “From today onwards, I want you to use the power of the divine dragon to accompany me in cultivation.”

“Use the power of the Divine Dragon to accompany you in your cultivation?”Qin Yu was somewhat puzzled.

The crane said indifferently, “I will suppress my strength to the same level as you and fight with you.”

Qin Yu touched his chin.

Although this crane had suppressed his strength to the half-step martial saint level, his physical body was still that of a martial saint.

In addition, he was originally a heaven rank demonic beast. As such, the advantage of Qin Yu’s chaotic body no longer existed.

Seeing that Qin Yu did not speak for a long time, immortal crane stood up and said, “I will not use you for nothing. After the matter is settled, I will agree to a request of yours.”
