Qin Yu held on tightly to Yan Ruoxue.

Yan Ruoxue was stunned. She quickly turned around and looked at Qin Yu.

At this moment, Qin Yu was struggling to open her eyes and force a smile.

“You have indeed come…” Qin Yu opened his mouth and murmured in a low voice.

Yan Ruoxue ignored all the obstructions and quickly returned to Qin Yu’s side.

!!

She grabbed Qin Yu’s hands with both hands and said in a soft voice, “I told you, as long as you crush the jade, I will definitely come back for you.”

“Miss, we must return immediately. If the master finds out that we sneaked out, I’m afraid we’ll get into trouble.” The person behind reminded her.

However, Yan Ruoxue ignored him and continued to hold Qin Yu’s hand tightly.

“Miss, if the master finds out, I’m afraid it will bring him trouble.” at this time, someone reminded her.

When she heard this, Yan Ruoxue’s expression immediately became a little unnatural.

She tried her best to maintain her smile and whispered, “Qin Yu, I have to go. I will wait for you in Zhongzhou…”

Qin Yu grabbed Yan Ruoxue’s hand tightly and said with difficulty, “I don’t want you to marry someone else. I’ll definitely beat up the other chaotic body…

Yan Ruoxue was stunned. She never thought that Qin Yu already knew about these things.

For a long time, Yan Ruoxue did not say a word.

After a long time, she forced a smile and said, “I will do my best and promise to only marry you.”

“Miss, we really have to go.” The person behind her urged.

Yan Ruoxue had no choice but to let go of Qin Yu’s hand. She whispered, “Qin Yu, protect yourself.”

With that, Yan Ruoxue followed the group of people and stepped into the teleportation formation.

After the flashes of light, Pilgrimage City returned to its peaceful state as if nothing had happened.

Qin Yu lay on the ground, feeling a deep sense of powerlessness again.

In the face of the powerful Yan family, Yan Ruoxue was probably under great pressure.

After all, this was a world of cultivation. Strength was everything. Without great strength, no one could change anything.

He lay on the ground, looking up at the sky.

He was surrounded by a strong and pungent smell of blood, and he was surrounded by dirty blood.

Qin Yu was lying there, recovering from his injuries and calming himself down.

The powerful pressure made Qin Yu unable to calm down for a long time.

The other chaotic body was probably so powerful that Yan Ruoxue had lost confidence.

To Qin Yu, this was something he could not accept.

He got up from the ground with difficulty and walked out of Pilgrimage City with heavy steps.

Then, Qin Yu summoned the Divine Eagle.

He sat on the back of the Divine Eagle and searched for the next city.

Even though Qin Yu had not seen the Yan family make a move, the current situation in Pilgrimage City had explained everything.

To be able to cause rivers of blood to flow in Pilgrimage City in such a short time, the Yan family must be much more powerful than he had imagined.

On the other side.

The entire Nanzhou was anxiously waiting for the arrival of the two Chao brothers.

They had seen with their own eyes the large gathering of the Chao family’s troops. Many people had spontaneously gathered together, planning to face this disaster together.

However, as time passed, no one from the Chao family arrived.

Very quickly, the sky darkened, but the entire Nanzhou was still calm.

“What’s going on? Could the two Chao brothers be joking?”

“Impossible, who would joke about this kind of thing.”

“Could it be that they changed their decision at the last minute?”

For a moment, everyone was puzzled, but their nerves were still tense.

At this moment, a piece of news reached Nanzhou.

Pilgrimage City had been destroyed by a mysterious force in an instant. The entire city had become a dead city with no signs of life! Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

As soon as these words were spoken, the entire Nanzhou immediately boiled over!

They were rejoicing over the fact that they had avoided this disaster while guessing who the mysterious force was.

“To destroy Pilgrimage City in a short time, what kind of power is this? Could it be that a True Saint is making a move?”

“I’m afraid that no one other than a True Saint can do this!”

“But there is no environment in this world that can give birth to a True Saint…”

“The Ancient Saints must have done it. Don’t forget that there are still Ancient Saints alive in this world.”

“Ancient Saint? How could there be an Ancient Saint in Lizhou?”

The entire Nanzhou was shocked, but no one knew who the attacker was.

This matter became more and more mysterious. In the end, there were even rumors that the Chao family had angered the heavens and earth and was instantly destroyed.

However, no matter what the reason was, Nanzhou had indeed survived this disaster.

In a remote place in Nanzhou.

Xiao Sheng had also received this news.

In contrast to everyone’s shock, he looked extremely calm, as if he had already guessed it.

…

In the North Plain.

Yuan Xiu, who had been waiting for good news also received the news at this moment.

“Lord, there are no signs of a fierce battle at the scene. I’m afraid this is a one-sided massacre.” Sima Bei said in a low voice.

Yuan Xiu narrowed his eyes and frowned, “A one-sided massacre? The two brothers of the Chao family may not be considered powerful, but the secret treasures in their hands cannot be underestimated. Who has such terrifying abilities?”

“Could it be as they have guessed? Could it be an Ancient Saint from Nanzhou? ” Sima Bei said with a frown.

“Impossible,” Yuan Xiu snorted and said, “How could there be an Ancient Saint in Nanzhou?”

“But other than the Ancient Saints, I’m afraid no one can kill the two brothers of the Chao family so easily.” Yong Ji couldn’t help but frown.

He had personally experienced the terrifying power of the purple cloud pearl. It was a terrifying Dharma Treasure that was comparable to the aura of a True Saint!

Yuan Xiu remained silent. With a cold expression, he said,”Now is not the time to think about this. Since the two brothers from the Chao family are dead, then you must head to Nanzhou as soon as possible. No matter what price you have to pay, you must find Xiao Sheng. You cannot let him step into the Reversion Void Stage!”

“Understood.” Yong Ji nodded and left.

In the dark.

He Teng quietly listened to all of this.

He was different from Yong Ji and the others. He had already guessed something about the destruction of Pilgrimage City.

“The Yan family of the nine great aristocratic families. Other than them, I’m afraid no one else can wipe out a city without a sound.” He Teng narrowed his eyes and sneered.

He was also an old acquaintance of Yan Ruoxue and was quite familiar with her background and personality.

When she was on earth, there were countless legends about her.

“Yan Ruoxue, you’re still secretly helping him.” He Teng sneered.

But he did not panic, because he quickly thought of a countermeasure.

Of course, He Teng didn’t tell Yuan Xiu. After all, he didn’t even treat them as his own.

In the following days, Qin Yu was still in Xihuang, looking for the city.
