2476 Dark and Quiet

Chen Zhisha shook his head.

Wan Li was expressionless.

“Clang!”

As Wan Li finished speaking, the golden wheel of great compassion began to spin.

Under Wan Li’s control, a suffocating sharpness slammed onto the altar.

This time, the golden wheel of great compassion clashed with the altar’s physical body, and an irritating sound came from the point of contact.

However, no matter how powerful the golden wheel of great compassion was, it could not shake the enormous altar.

“Ultimate evil power, dispel!”

At the edge of the massive golden wheel, countless formation runes that could not be seen by the naked eye suddenly moved around.

As these tadpole-like runes came into contact with the sword as if threading through needles, a surge of darkest power spread out from the edge.

“The rumors seem true. The golden wheel of the great compassion of the Ten Thousand Budhha Sect has sealed countless tremendously evil people. After that, Then, the Buddhists chant sutras day and night to reform them. However, the power of ultimate evil can also be of great help in times of crisis, but one needs to use the soul to control this golden wheel. It’s a pity for Master Wan Li. He is a good person.”

Flower Granny sighed. “All the previous sect masters of the Ten Thousand Budhha Sect died under the backlash of the evil power released by this golden wheel of great compassion.”

The karmic fire burned on Wan Li’s body, and in an instant, only a bright relic was left from his body.

“Whoosh!”

The relic turned into a golden light and entered the golden wheel of great compassion.

“Boom!”

The immense power of evil exploded, and the altar emitted a sound, as if it could not bear the strain and was on the verge of shattering.

Outside, countless densely packed cracks slowly appeared.

At this moment, almost all the monster race worshippers and the six-winged monster race had completed their sacrifices. The demon fire that filled the sky was less than ten meters high up from the human race.

And it kept on falling. After the golden wheel struck, the demonic fire finally stopped falling.

Chang Mang and Jue Wu could not help but roar.

Even if one used the tentacle of the soul to sense the power of that darkness from tremendously far away, one could still feel the endless power and destruction contained within.

Through a slight touch of his soul, Qin Yu could suddenly feel many violent emotions in his emotions.

It was an intention set on destroying everything, annihilating all living beings, a heart set on world destruction.

A swastika!

In the dark sky, an enormous soul phantom appeared in the middle.

As he appeared, the power of darkness seemed to have been sucked in and surrounded him.

A golden swastika appeared on Wan Li’s forehead.

It was dark and quiet.

Wan Li said indifferently. The power of darkness formed a kingdom

At this moment, the kingdom formed by the tremendous evil power of darkness actually isolated the power of the Path of Heaven of the monster race from the altar.

“Boom!”

In an instant, the altar suddenly shattered.

Almost at the same time, the swastika on Wan Li’s forehead turned pitch black.

Wan Li’s lips moved slightly, and his soul phantom suddenly cracked open. The moment the altar disappeared, his entire person vanished like a breeze.

Not everyone could successfully use the power of ultimate darkness. It was because it required tremendous willpower and mental endurance to resist the dark power of the monster race that tried to erode the mind and devour the soul.

Wan Li’s soul corroded by forcefully using such powerful dark and ultimate evil power.

This kind of power carried a price. Using the power of ultimate evil and darkness would gradually erode the user’s mind and soul, making the user cold, cruel, and even crazy.

Many cultivators who had tried to control this energy ended up as unsalvagable victims enslaved by the evil force.

The moment Wan Li unsealed the golden wheel of great compassion, he had given up on his life.

“Boom!”

After the golden wheel of great compassion launched this attack, the three enormous dharma idols of the Buddhist Kingdom formed a hand seal.

It absorbed the scattered ultimate evil power again, turned into a golden stream of light that penetrated the crystal wall, and vanished before everyone’s eyes.

“Senior Brother!”

“Let go of the thought and be at ease. You and I both have our obsessions, but we don’t know who is right or wrong.”

Pain flashed across Chen Zhisha’s eyes. He was his closest martial nephew.

He hated evil and saved others with kindness. He much resembled himself when he was young.

“Boom!” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

The fall of this altar did not destroy the sacrificial fire of the monster race.

Instead, it fell at an even faster speed. However, the power of the sacrifice of the monster race seemed not activated because of the damage to this altar.

“Whoosh!”

Qin Yu heard a soft voice.

It was like the sound of a flame burning on paper. In an instant, a miserable cry spread throughout the heavens.

Nearly half of the continent was burning with demonic flames, and the miserable howls did not last long.

In just two seconds, more than 60% of nearly one billion people on the entire continent died in an instant.

Qin Yu and the others looked at half of the continent that had suddenly become a land of death in a daze. Six hundred million people were destroyed just like that.

How many families were there? All of them turned into dust in an instant.

The remaining people, even the cultivators, were trembling.

They did not know what had happened at all. They were afraid that such demonic flames would descend again.

Nearly 600 million souls floated in the air, and in an instant, a massive gust of wind blew across the entire continent.

Even if Qin Yu used all his strength, the power of this violent wind was still too strong.

His body could not stop swaying from side to side until his six acupoints started shaking. Only with the support of a massive force did he stabilize his body.

He supported Lei Xin and Flower Granny as he stared at the enormous Heaven Gate that appeared in the sky.

Following the appearance of the Heaven Gate in the demonic cloud, the power of the soul surged into the Heaven Gate like seawater.

In just a breath, the violent wind of the soul stopped.

A blood-red eyeball appeared behind the demonic door.

Its pupil was like flames, and it seemed to be able to see through all the secrets of all living beings.

As his eyeball moved, green light shone wherever the gaze passed, and a phantom reflected before the pupil.

As the eye of the monster race rotated, everything it saw burned and turned into ashes.

Massive energy descended from the sky and fell from the previous mountain peak.

In an instant, the power of the Path of Heaven of the monster race entered the bodies of the 5,000 human race women. Their faces distorted in pain, and their bodies instantly swelled up like balloons.

After that, as if shedding skin, their hairs, skins, and bones all shattered. One by one, the gigantic young monster race replaced them.
