Chapter 1037: Chapter 1,037, true strength

Star Seizer didn’t say anything more. His feet shook, and his body shot out.

Qin Yu didn’t hesitate at all and immediately followed.

“Quick, the two of them have changed places. Quickly chase after them!”

The crowd hidden in the dark surged out like a tide and sped away!

Soon, the two of them arrived at an empty land.

Zhai Xing seemed to have chosen a place long ago. This place was like a wasteland, devoid of human life.

Qin Yu looked coldly at Zhai Xing and said, “Are you choosing a graveyard for yourself?”

“It’s not certain whose graveyard it is,”Zhai Xing said coldly.

“There’s no need to say more. Let Me See just how capable you are as a genius of the new era!”

After he finished speaking, the internal Qi on Zhai Xing’s body erupted!

His muscles instantly swelled up, and his already sturdy body instantly became even thicker!

Qin Yu was slightly shocked when he sensed the internal Qi on Zhai Xing’s body.

It had to be said that Zhai Xing’s strength far surpassed that of the other martial saints!

Other than immortal crane, he was practically the most powerful opponent Qin Yu had ever seen!

“Qin Yu, if you die today, don’t blame me!”Zhai Xing said coldly and shot at Qin Yu with his thick body!

His extremely fast speed brought up gusts of wind!

In a breath’s time, Zhai Xing had already arrived in front of Qin Yu!

Qin Yu naturally did not dare to be negligent. He clenched his fist and welcomed him!

With just one punch, the shaking ground began to collapse. Smoke and dust surged up like a fountain!

“Bang Bang Bang!”

The two did not use any magnificent spells. They relied on their powerful bodies to collide!

Each collision was like a bomb exploding in the sky, deafening!

In the blink of an eye, the two had exchanged dozens of punches!

Everyone was dumbfounded.

With such speed, it was already very difficult to see clearly with the naked eye!

“So Powerful!”Someone exclaimed.

“It seems like the two are evenly matched.”

“Qin Yu has just entered the martial saint realm, but he can fight to the death with a late-stage martial saint! No wonder the Jingdu martial arts association has always wanted to get rid of him!”

“After this battle, Qin Yu will definitely be famous throughout the world.”

“Boom!”

Just as everyone was discussing, another fist collided!

The two froze in mid-air, and between their fists, streams of flames collided.

“Chaotic body indeed lives up to its reputation,”Zhai Xing said coldly.

Qin Yu said in a deep voice, “Your strength is also stronger than I imagined.”

“No need to talk nonsense. Let’s end this quickly.”Zhai Xing withdrew his fist and took a step back.

Qin Yu looked at Zhai Xing and said, “I know your strongest technique. Use your star picking hand to fight.”

“I don’t need to deal with you!”

Zhai Xing shouted. He formed the sun and moon seal with both hands. The two seals slammed together and rolled toward Qin Yu like a chariot!

The Sun and Moon Seal was like a millstone, covering the sky and covering the sun as it rolled toward Qin Yu!

Everyone turned pale with fright and quickly retreated, afraid that they would be affected.

Qin Yu looked at the rolling seal and did not dare to hide his strength anymore.

He roared and golden light burst out from his body. His spiritual power instantly reached its peak!

“Absolute beginning Sacred Fist!”

Qin Yu waved his fists. Every joint of his arms seemed to be glowing!

The two’s moves were open and powerful. In a trance, it was as if they were on an ancient battlefield, with thousands of soldiers and horses galloping!

“Boom!”

The collision of the two techniques instantly crushed this piece of wasteland into dust!

The seal of the sun and moon began to shatter, then turned into specks and shot out in all directions!

Bang! Bang! Bang

Those who could not dodge in time were instantly taken away with their divine sense!

Jiang he and Xu Huaigu quickly took action and displayed their divine abilities, protecting everyone within and avoiding a calamity!

Looking at the shattered seal of the sun and moon, Zhai Xing could not help but Roar in fury.

His two iron fists collided, and a terrifying radiance erupted between them!

The radiance transformed into a strange phenomenon, and an ancient and grand scene crushed towards Qin Yu!

This was a true great divine ability, a divine ability that Qin Yu, Jiang He, and the others had yet to comprehend!

That scene stirred up the Qi of the Great Dao, and was incomparably heavy. It was as if a real world had completely smashed onto Qin Yu’s body!

In an instant, the ground under Qin Yu’s feet instantly shattered!

His body was almost pushed to the limit, and all of his spiritual power surged out!

“Ah! !”

Qin Yu roared repeatedly, but it was still difficult to stop the crushing of this abnormal phenomenon!

“What kind of spell is this? It’s as if it’s going to crush this world!”Xu Huaigu could not help but be alarmed when he saw this.

Jiang he said in a deep voice, “I’ve heard of such an ancient great divine power, but I’ve never seen it before. It’s said that a strand of internal Qi from the abnormal phenomenon is as heavy as ten million Jin!”

Just as Jiang he said, the strand of internal Qi from the abnormal phenomenon instantly collapsed the ground!

The weight of the entire abnormal phenomenon that Qin Yu was carrying could be imagined! Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Blood seeped out of Qin Yu’s pores, and his body seemed to have withstood it to the extreme!

“One punch can break ten thousand arts!”

At this critical moment, Qin Yu instantly unleashed his trump card and smashed a single hand at the phenomenon!

“Boom!”

Under such a terrifying power, star Seizer’s great divine ability also began to tremble!

The world within the phenomenon seemed to be about to collapse!

Qin Yu took the opportunity to draw out his bronze sword and raised his hand to unleash the nine absolute beginning slashes!

With a slash of the sword, the anomaly was instantly cut into two pieces, and then it was reduced to ashes!

Qin Yu panted heavily as he stood in the distance and looked at Zhai Xing.

Zhai Xing’s expression was calm, as if he had long expected that this technique would not be able to kill Qin Yu.

“I didn’t expect you to be able to hold on for so long,”said Zhai Xing.

Qin Yu wiped the blood that flowed down from his body and said, “I also didn’t expect you to force out my trump card so quickly.”

Zhai Xing had a trace of self-mockery on the corner of his mouth. He said coldly, “Let me see your true strength.”

Qin Yu was startled, then nodded and said, “Okay.”
