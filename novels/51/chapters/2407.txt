Chapter 2408 Family Extermination

Saber of Annihilation!

Qin Yu slashed out his saber almost instantly.

“Qin Yu, sh*t, it’s me!”

A familiar voice sounded, and a sleazy-looking big face suddenly appeared beside him. His mouth even had the smell of chives.

The black saber exploded at where the man with the mustache was but failed to release the power. It seemed to have been suppressed by something as if it had only lit a match.

“Man with the mustache, why are you here?”

“I was going to ask you the same.”

The man with the mustache said irritably.

“Tell me quickly, do you know something? Saintess Gu is also here. I’m going to shout if you don’t tell me.”

Qin Yu tugged at his mustache. There was definitely something extraordinary where this guy was. His nose was even more sensitive than a dog’s.

“Shut up. The reason I’m here is to remind you.”

The man with the mustache trembled when he heard him mention Saintess Gu, but his expression immediately turned cold.

“This is something the Ji family had set up long ago. The sword hanging in this temple is an ancient ghostly sword. The extremely wicked scarecrow sword hilt, the soul-summoning wind chimes within the hilt, and the blade, a fragment of the bone of the supreme Emperor Fengdur of the ghost realm, are all tremendously sinister items. This sword had been hanging here since 10,000 years ago. Since then, the entire Great Xia Royal Family seemed to have been cursed. Not only did the strength of the descendants of the royal family decline, but the number of their descendants also decreased.”

The man with the mustache seemed to have investigated many secrets.

“D*mn it!”

Qin Yu clenched his fists tightly, making a snapping sound. He had some suspicions when he was talking to the prince back then.

However, his strength was only at the Reversion Void Stage at that time, so he could not perceive these situations at all.

“Ultimate Yin and Ultimate Yang are two extremes. The qi of the imperial path was the qi of Ultimate Yang, while this ghostly sword has the qi of Ultimate Yin. Only by reconciling the qi of Yin and Yang could the ghostly sword be completely fused into one. Once the ghostly sword is formed, the Ji family would probably become the number one family in the Holy Region.” ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

The man with the mustache sneered and said.

“For the sake of their selfish interests, they destroyed an entire family. This Ji family is truly ruthless. Those vengeful spirits might not be able to escape from the Imperial Palace because of the ghostly sword.”

Chang Mang frowned and said. Compared to the monster race, these methods were even more vicious.

Among the people in the Great Xia Royal Family, nearly 500,000 had the most energy of dead bodies. This ghostly sword had absorbed the internal qi of the royal family, and the curse on the sword had affected its people. Ultimately, the entire royal family was completely exterminated.

“Qin Yu, let’s go. If you believe me, then leave this place. Even I don’t dare to have any designs on this ghostly sword. I’m here mainly to refine something. I’m afraid I’ll be in danger if that little girl discovers me. You mustn’t get carried away. Several generations of the Ji family have set this up. ”

The man with the mustache said to Qin Yu with a solemn expression. Suddenly, his expression changed.

“D*mn! Someone is coming over.”

With a swoosh, the man with the mustache disappeared.

At this moment, the door of the temple slowly opened.

At the door, two figures, one big and the other small, slowly pushed the door open and walked in.

They were Ji Ao, Ji Yuyi, and the three Supreme Elders of the Ji family.

“Why must you force me to kill you for something that has nothing to do with you?”

Ji Ao sighed softly.

“It has nothing to do with me. Your Ji family exterminated over 500,000 vengeful souls from the Great Xia Royal Family. Can your Ji family bear this blood debt blood?”

Qin Yu stared at that delicate face. He did not understand how Ji Ao could remain calm when he said those words.

“Heaven and Earth are indifferent to all beings, treating them like straw dogs. Those on the path of cultivation are on a solitary road, and it’s either life or death. The Path of Heaven could kill billions of living beings with a single thought. Only those who were powerful had greater authority,” Ji Ao said softly.

Qin Yu thought of the prince’s eyes that remained open when he died with a grievance. The people of the Great Xia Royal Family must be in despair. Countless people were cursed, and their souls were in shambles. Their lives were constantly being devoured by this ghostly sword.

“Shut up!”

The power of annihilation surged frantically onto the black saber, and Qin Yu slashed it out again.

However, Ji Ao did not even look at it. Just like before, that burst of energy suddenly disappeared.

One of the Supreme Elders was expressionless. He took out a jade bottle and threw it on the ground.

Instantly, a howl sounded. A distorted and almost transparent soul struggled desperately, letting out a shrill cry.

“Your Highness!”

Qin Yu cried out involuntarily. That was clearly the deceased prince.

Once a human died, their three souls and seven spirits would definitely dissipate. All their consciousness would return to the ghost realm and reenter the reincarnation cycle.

But the Ji family had used some methods to break this convention at this moment.

Suddenly, the entire Imperial Palace was full of mournful cries. The vengeful spirits outside seemed to have been summoned.

Countless resentful souls surged into the ghostly sword like a hurricane, and a dense green light appeared on the ghostly sword.

That immense coldness seemed to want to freeze Qin Yu’s soul into ice that would last for ten thousand years.

The soul that had entered the ghostly sword let out a tremendously distorted scream as if it had suffered tremendous torture.

“The imperial aura of the Great Xia Royal Family has finally been entirely drawn into the evil eye. Today is the day of great prosperity for our Ji family. After the efforts of our family heads of three generations, we have finally completed this task.”

Ji Ao’s face revealed a look of madness, and he laughed loudly at the sky.

“You’ve also killed the son of the prince?”

“It’s just a spiritual stone. Even if we have an endless spiritual mountain, it can’t compare to a corner of the ghostly sword. Since my Ji family obtained the bone of Emperor Fengdu in ancient times, we have been planning this. With the aura of the royal family, we have finally refined this ghostly sword!”

Ji Ao stared at the ghostly sword in the air with a mesmerized expression.

As the prince’s soul entered the ghostly sword floating in the air, patterns appeared on it, one after another.

The sword hilt, the body, and the soul-summoning bell were entangled together.

The scarecrow let out a mournful shriek. Its heart was actually beating like a human.

Qin Yu felt his soul beating along with the scarecrow’s heartbeat.

“Qin Yu, the ghostly sword achieved Great Success today. I initially didn’t want to attract too much attention and let you go. But since you’re courting death, you’ll be the first sacrifice for this sword.”

Ji Ao laughed maniacally.

“Idiot, Nine Thunder God’s Thunder Technique!”

Qin Yu’s body floated up, and the most formidable divine lightning struck down.

After the lightning flashed, it finally struck Ji Ao.

However, it seemed to be affected by the ghostly sword, and the power of the divine lightning was greatly reduced.

“Don’t let him take the ghostly sword!”

Qin Yu shouted. Jue Wu, Chang Mang, and Elder Guai instantly rushed out.

The three Supreme Elders behind Ji Ao moved and attacked them.

Amidst the heaven and earth-shattering tremors, the three Tribulation Transcending Stage cultivators attacked with their full strength.

“Get lost! Sumeru Realm!”

Qin Yu suddenly fused the Sumeru ring into his arm, and the world power in his fist suddenly exploded.

In an instant, the three Tribulation Transcending Stage cultivators spat out blood and retreated. They fell onto the ground, and their fate was unknown.
