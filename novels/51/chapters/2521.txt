Chapter 2522 Immortal Emperor Awakens

They had already done some research but deemed it impossible to make a move on Qin Yu no matter what.

Letting Qin Yu fight against Si Shiyue in his worst state was not to kill him with a borrowed knife but to kill him directly.

“Holy Lord Su and I had a conversation. In general, the Saint of the human race also have factions. My way probably conflicts with his, so Revered Qi has been targeting me.”

Qin Yu said with a bitter smile.

“When one reaches the Saint Realm, one can vaguely sense one’s fate. After entering the fifth level, my bloodline awakened, and I also had some comprehension. Qin Yu, perhaps your existence will bring him some unfavorable things, so he’s targeting you.”

Yan Ruoxue was furious, especially after hearing Revered Qi’s arrangement.

She was even more furious that her bloodline had been treated as a commodity since she was on Earth.

Even now, she was still taken as an emotionless cultivator.

“One day, I will kill him!”

Yan Ruoxue said fiercely. Even if they were the fifth level and above, they should not look down on her this way.

Perhaps she could still accept it if they were sixth level from the alien race.

However, Revered Qi was the alliance’s leader and still did such a thing. Everyone could not help but be furious.

Flower Granny Hua her head slightly. She pointed at the sky and did not say anything else.

Qin Yu suddenly thought of the mark Su Xinghe left behind. It might be a means to save his life.

However, with the methods of a Saint of the sixth level, as long as this mark existed, he probably could not escape Su Xinghe’s surveillance no matter where he went or what he did.

From what was happening now, Su Xinghe was considered friendlier to him than others. However, with such an eye embedded in his Sea of Soul, Qin Yu felt unhappy no matter what.

Qin Yu tried to isolate this soul mark with the power of divine sense.

However, no matter how he tried, he seemed unable to stop that power.

Forget it, and he could not be bothered anymore. If Su Xinghe had the intention to harm him, he probably could not have left unscathed from the battle just now.

Seeing there was no way to isolate that power, and he could not use violence to attack this mark, Qin Yu could only ignore it.

“During the battle between Si Shiyue and I, I had a comprehension. It seems that there is an undetectable shackle in our world! I’ve never sensed this power before. This time, after the three powers combined, the Primordial Chaos elemental energy erupted and entered the desolate divine eye. This was the first time I detected it.”

Qin Yu told everyone about his discovery during his battle with Si Shiyue. He wanted to see if Flower Granny Hua and the others had comprehended this.

“It’s the Cage of the Path of Heaven. I didn’t expect you to notice it. It’s rare for you to sense it with your cultivation realm.”

A dry voice suddenly sounded. It was the corpse of the Yao family’s Immortal Emperor.

Previously, after the Immortal Emperor’s corpse’s soul traveled with Qin Yu in the ghost realm, it had already become tremendously weak.

He had been recuperating in the Coffin of Nine Lifetimes but unexpectedly had awakened now. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“Cage of the Path of Heaven? Does it imprison all living beings in the universe? What is the purpose of the Path of Heaven? Is this cage the reason why it has been difficult to break through in recent years?”

Yan Ruoxue said in surprise.

“You’re quite sharp, little girl. The Saints have already grasped a portion of the power of karma, and thus the Path of Heaven can’t completely erase it. The setting of this cage is to completely cut off the path for living beings to advance to the sixth level Saint. Something must have happened above that caused the Path of Heaven to set up this restriction. However, I can no longer sense the changes above.”

Immortal Emperor Yao said softly.

At this moment, it was like an iron chain surrounding the vast universe. He could not guess such a change even if he once was an Immortal Emperor.

“If you want to find the reason, you must break this restriction and become a Saint. Only then will you have a chance to find out. However, you can’t break this Cage of the Path of Heaven with your strength now unless a Saint guides you. Otherwise, you won’t have a chance.”

“How did the masked woman of nine lifetimes break through and become a Saint above the fifth level?”

Qin Yu voiced his doubts.

“The Nine Paths Convergence, from the Way of the Primordial before the nine lifetimes to the Path of Heaven technique of the current year of the Path of Heaven, the power of the nine Great Daos perfectly combined is indeed terrifying, but it still fails to break this cage.”

Immortal Emperor Yao seemed to have seen the masked woman before. He shook his head after thinking for a few moments.

“Did you mean to say that the masked woman could only break through to the fifth level with the help of a Saint?”

Qin Yu immediately thought of Yan Tianfeng’s death. Could this be a tacit understanding between the Saints?

“The cosmic luck occupied by a Saint is tremendously terrifying. If one wants to go up, the cosmic luck of many others will be distributed. Yan Tianfeng’s death may be the key to the masked woman’s advancement. Moreover, this might involve even more things. Perhaps the Saints of the human race are also involved.”

The Yao family’s Immortal Emperor’s corpse revealed a strange smile.

“When you reach the sixth level of the Saint Realm, you can pry into your own fate. How can it be so easy for a fifth-level monster race to cross realms? Yan Tianfeng cultivated the Way of Tides. Without obscuring the secrets of heaven and plotting to strike at his weakest moment, even with another 2,000 eight-winged monster race, you would not be possible to kill him.

“Interesting, it’s interesting. If not for the fact that I’m only left with a fragment of my soul, I would like to see what’s going on in the world above the fifth level. Did many changes occur in this world while we were fighting against the sea of the Path of Heaven?”

This time, Immortal Emperor Yao was exceptionally talkative. He seemed to have recovered quite well with the help of the Coffin of Nine Lifetimes.

Qin Yu felt a headache. The Saint Realm seemed to have many complicated relationships. Recalling Su Xinghe’s helpless smile, perhaps there were also many intense battles in the sixth level’s realm.

“Immortal Emperor Yao, how can the human race cultivators break out of this cage with our current strength?”

Yan Ruoxue suddenly spoke.

“In my opinion, it’s impossible. Si Shiyue’s five elements, the masked woman’s Nine Paths Convergence, and Xiao Sheng’s Fist of Heaven and Earth, all of these powers could break through to the sixth level in our era. However, now that there’s an additional layer of Cage of the Path of Heaven, perhaps you all will have a breakthrough one day when you cultivate again. However, the Saint and above know your every move like the back of their hands. If you want to go up and share their cosmic luck, do you think they will agree?”

Immortal Emperor Yao smiled. Hearing this, even Yan Ruoxue could not help but reveal a dejected expression.

“Even if it’s a war between races now, won’t the human race’s Saint consider guiding them?”

Qin Yu asked with a frown. The Saint and above was also a member of the human race.
