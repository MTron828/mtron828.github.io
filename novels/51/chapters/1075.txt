Chapter 1076: Chapter 1,076. Each of them had their own ulterior motives 

When they heard these words, everyone’s expression changed slightly.

Of course, they had the same thought. It was just that the current Qin Yu was too powerful. He was so powerful that they could not bear the slightest intention of becoming his enemy.

Moreover, they were not fools. This Yan Jinyao was clearly using them.

“Each of the major secret realms will send out a martial saint. Killing him, Qin Yu, will be a piece of cake.”Yan Jinyao knocked on the table and said.

“If you don’t make a move today, then you will become a thorn in Qin Yu’s flesh in the future. At that time, no one will help you.”

Everyone fell into silence and seemed to be in a dilemma.

Yan Jinyao snorted lightly and said, “I can promise everyone that if I take the position of the president, I will distribute all the resources to each of the major mystery realms and everyone will get a share!”

“The second mystery realm is extremely huge and rich in resources. Are you willing to let him, Qin Yu, take it all for himself?”

“Young Master Yan, what do you want us to do?”Bai Tianhe quickly stood up and asked eagerly.

Yan Jinyao knocked on the table and said lightly, “It’s very simple. Everyone will send out a martial saint and work together to get rid of Qin Yu.”

“Young Master Yan, can’t you kill him, Qin Yu?”A realm master sneered.

Yan Jinyao’s face darkened. He braced himself and said, “Of course I’m not afraid of him, Qin Yu! As long as he has helpers by his side, if it’s a one-on-one situation, I’ll kill him as easily as slaughtering a dog and cutting vegetables!”

“Oh, that’s simple. We’ll join hands with each of the Realm Masters to stop his people. I guarantee they won’t be able to help him, Qin Yu. What do you think?”Someone said.

Yan Jinyao’s expression instantly became even uglier. He couldn’t help but curse repeatedly in his heart.

“Right, Young Master Yan, don’t worry. We guarantee that no one will be able to interfere!”The others also said.

At this moment, Yan Jinyao was immediately unable to back down. He could only brace himself and say, “Alright, then I’ll have to thank everyone for helping.”

“Young Master Yan, don’t worry. We are allies. It’s only right to help you.”A realm Lord said with a chuckle.

Yan Jinyao couldn’t help but curse in his heart, “When I kill Qin Yu, I’ll kill all of You Idiots!” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

After the meeting ended, Yan Jinyao turned around and walked out of the office.

On the way home, Yan Jinyao felt more and more uneasy.

For some reason, Yan Jinyao, who had always been confident, felt a little scared at this moment.

This feeling of fear made Yan Jinyao extremely unhappy.

“I hope the secret technique of the Sky Blood Rainbow will work,”Yan Jinyao said in a low voice.

“It seems that young master Yan is not very confident.”

At this moment, a gloomy voice sounded in Yan Jinyao’s ear.

He turned around and saw a black mist slowly condensing.

The mist quickly condensed into a human shape and stood in front of Yan Jinyao.

“It’s You? He Teng?”Yan Jinyao narrowed his eyes slightly and recognized this person.

He Teng was still hiding in his black robe, and the internal Qi on his body was getting more and more horrifying.

“Young Master Yan, I’m afraid that I’m the person who understands you the most in the world,”he teng said indifferently.

“Oh?”Yan Jinyao raised his eyebrows.

He Teng put his hands behind his back, he said slowly, “I understand how you feel now. Back then, I was the same as you. I went from being the number one person in the central plains that everyone had their eyes on to the background board. I was full of confidence at the beginning, but not only did I doubt myself.”

“And the reason for all of this is Qin Yu!”He Teng’s tone was extremely cold.

Yan Jinyao snorted lightly and said, “I’m not the same as you. It’s not certain who is whose background board.”

“Oh? is that really what you think?”He Teng said with a faint smile.

“If that’s really what you think, Why Are You So Afraid?”

“If that’s really what you think, why do you need to join hands with the other secret realms to kill Qin Yu? If you really have the confidence to defeat Qin Yu, why don’t you take the Glory for yourself?”

Yan Jinyao still said stubbornly, “I said that it’s because Qin Yu has helpers, that’s all!”

“Hehe, don’t deceive yourself.”He Teng sneered.

“Everyone in the world knows that Qin Yu wouldn’t do that. He doesn’t want to become the laughing stock of the world.”

A trace of anger flashed across Yan Jinyao’s face. He clenched his fists and coldly said, “What exactly are you trying to say!”

He Teng put his hands behind his back and said with a faint smile, “I know that you are still unwilling to admit that you are inferior to him. In the beginning, I was the same as you, but I quickly figured it out.”

“As long as he is dead, I will still be the number one person in the Central Plains! Just like you now. As long as he, Qin Yu, is dead, you, Yan Jinyao, will still be the number one person in the younger generation!”

Yan Jinyao kept silent, as if he was afraid of something.

“You want to be famous, don’t you? You Don’t want to be poked in the spine by others, saying that you bully the weak with the numbers, do you?”He Teng said indifferently.

Yan Jinyao suddenly raised his head. He looked at He Teng and waited for him to continue.

He teng continued, “That’s why you wanted to discuss with the masters of many mystical realms and kill Qin Yu together with them. You claimed that it was because Qin Yu was too overbearing and caused public anger...”

“Yes.”This time, Yan Jinyao simply admitted it.

If they were to bully the weak with their numbers, even if they killed Qin Yu, their reputation would be destroyed.

However, if everyone attacked Qin Yu together, the meaning would be different.

If they made Qin Yu into a villain and attacked him together, not only would they not be looked down upon, but they would also be regarded as heroes.

Unfortunately, the masters of the various Mystic Realms were not fooled at all.

“Do you have any good ideas?”Yan Jinyao asked.

He Teng raised his eyebrows and said, “It doesn’t seem appropriate to talk here, right?”

Yan Jinyao frowned slightly and said, “Follow me back to the Yan family. Let’s talk in detail.”

“Hahaha, good!”He Teng laughed and agreed.
