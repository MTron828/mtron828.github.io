1987 The Furious Qin Yu

All the royal family’s books obviously had personal feelings and could not be used as a reference at all.

They had covered up everything.

“No wonder the royal family’s library was left untouched. Perhaps the predecessors have already noticed it,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

He scanned through most of the library and noticed dust was everywhere. Obviously, no one had been here for a long time. “I think… the Immortal Slaying Sect’s transformation might have something to do with the royal family’s propaganda,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

!!

No matter how he looked at it, Ye Chuan was a young man who had broken the royal family’s suppression and was not the Demon Emperor they had created.

“Don’t over fantasize… Immortal Slaying Sect is the devil,” Heavenly Blood Rainbow said coldly.

Qin Yu chuckled and said, “The era you live in may not be the same as the first generation of the Immortal Slaying Sect. As time passed by, the propaganda of the royal family and their unique status must have changed the Immortal Slaying Sect.”

Heavenly Blood Rainbow snorted coldly and said, “You’re just an outsider. Do you know the Immortal Slaying Sect better than I do? Have you read the records of the Immortal Slaying Sect?”

Qin Yu thought for a while and felt it was true. If he made a conclusion based on his assumptions, it would indeed be biased.

After that, Qin Yu did not stay any longer. He also did not spend too much time looking at ancient times.

When Qi Yu returned to his accommodation, he glanced around but didn’t see Jue Wu.

“Eh? Where did she go?” Qin Yu frowned. Soon he saw the demonic egg on the table.

“This fellow didn’t even bring the demonic egg. Has something happened to her?” Qin Yu said in a low voice.

At this moment, the prince walked in from outside.

“Mr. Qin, you’ve finished reading so quickly?” the prince asked in surprise.

Qin Yu smiled and said, “I’m a little tired after reading a part of it and decided to take a rest. By the way, where’s Jue Wu? Why didn’t I see her?”

The prince was startled. He looked around and said in a low voice, “It’s strange. I don’t know either. She was still here just now.”

“You don’t know either?” Qin Yu frowned immediately, and he had a premonition of something ominous.

Could it be that someone had made a move on Jue Wu?

But that shouldn’t be the case. If someone had made a move, why was the demonic egg left behind?

Before Qin Yu could figure it out, a burly man came in from outside.

He went straight to Qin Yu with some ridicule and a cold smile on his face.

“Who are you? What brings you here?” the prince asked.

The burly man ignored the price. He looked at Qin Yu and sneered, “Qin Yu, someone is waiting for you outside Sky City.”

“Someone is waiting for me?” Qin Yu sneered. “Let him come in to find me then. Why? Do you want me to leave the city?”

The burly man was not in a hurry. He put his hands behind his back and said indifferently, “I’m not here to discuss with you. I’m here to inform you that you must leave the city within an hour.”

Qin Yu sneered and said, “You’re talking big. You’re from the Si family? Or the Yao family?”

A strange smile appeared on the burly man’s face. He squinted his eyes and said, “If you don’t leave the city within an hour, I’m afraid you won’t be able to see your friend again.”

Qin Yu’s expression changed, and he hurriedly said, “Did you guys take Jue Wu away?”

“Of course not. Jue Wu is Dean Lei’s personal disciple. How would we dare to make a move on her?” the burly man said indifferently. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

At this point, his tone suddenly changed. He sneered and said, “You have two friends. One is called Wen Da and the other Wen Er, right?”

“Wen Da and Wen Er?” Qin Yu’s expression turned ugly.

He instantly reached out grabbing the burly man’s collar, saying coldly, “Who did this?”

“What, are you going to attack me in the city?” the burly man didn’t answer but said mockingly.

Qin Yu gritted his teeth and scolded, “Stop talking nonsense with me. Where are Wen Da and Wen Er now?”

“You’ll see them after you leave the city. Of course, you only have an hour,” the burly man said coldly.

The prince by the side quickly tried to smooth things over. He said, “Mr. Qin, you must not act rashly.”

Qin Yu gritted his teeth. He glanced at the price and finally let go of the burly man.

The burly man had a smug smile on his face. He turned around and said, “Remember, if we don’t see you in an hour, you can just wait to collect their bodies.”

After saying this, the burly man turned around and left.

Without hesitation, Qin Yu stood up and was about to leave the city.

The prince stopped Qin Yu. He shook his head and said, Mr. Qin, I’m afraid they had set up an ambush outside the city. Wouldn’t you be courting death if you go out now?”

“But I can’t just watch my friend get into trouble!” Qin Yu said coldly.

The prince said in a deep voice, “Mr.Qin, you must stay calm. If there’s a Semi Saint outside, you’ll surely die! Moreover, will they let them go even if you go out?”

Qin Yu fell into silence.

That was true. Wen Da and Wen Er were insignificant in their eyes. They could just kill them.

Qin Yu kept walking back and forth in the room, his mind in a mess.

“Someone must have sent Jue Wu away in advance.” Qin Yu finally understood.

No wonder Jue Wue suddenly disappeared. It was all their doing!

“Your Highness, do you have any Saint Weapons in hand? Can you lend it to me?” Qin Yu said.

The prince shook his head and said with a bitter smile, “The nine great aristocratic families had long taken away all the magical artifacts of the royal family. They didn’t want to give the royal family any chance to make a comeback.”

Qin Yu was not in the mood to listen to the royal family’s story. All he could think about was how to save Wen Da and Wen Er and break out of this situation.

Time passed, but Qin Yu could not think of any countermeasures at all.

Outside the city, Gu Xinghe had his hands behind his back with a relaxed expression.

...

The cultivator beside him frowned and said, “It’s been so long. Are you sure he’ll come out?”

After saying that, he glanced at Wen da and Wen Er, who had been severely tortured. He mumbled, “Would he risk his life for these two trash?”

Gu Xinghe smiled and said, “Don’t worry. He’ll come out. He’ll definitely come out!”

Seeing this, the cultivator didn’t say anything further and could only continue to wait.

In the blink of an eye, only five minutes were left. But Qin Yu still had not come up with a solution.

“Looks like I can only give it my all,” Qin Yu stood up and said coldly.

After saying this, Qin Yu turned around and walked out of the Imperial Palace.

“Mr. Qin, are you really going to leave Sky City?” the prince couldn’t help but frown and say.

“Mmm,” Qin Yu responded. “I’ll do so even if I die.”

After saying that, Qin Yu no longer hesitated and immediately burst out of the city.
