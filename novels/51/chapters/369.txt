When he saw Qin Yu, Jia Gong’s expression suddenly changed!

He hurriedly sat up from the sofa and said in horror, “You... you Didn’t die?”

Qin Yu didn’t say anything. In the blink of an eye, he arrived in front of Jia Gong!

Then, his large hand grabbed Jia Gong’s neck and forcefully lifted him into the air!

“Don’t... Don’t kill me...” Jia Gong struggled desperately with a face full of fear.

Qin Yu asked coldly, “Where’s Yan Jiang?”

“Who... is Yan Jiang?” Jia Gong asked with difficulty.

“Forget it. I’ll search for him myself.” Qin Yu said coldly.

“Stop!”

At this moment, several Inner Strength Grandmasters suddenly rushed into the office!

They looked at Qin Yu nervously and said, “Put down our vice association leader quickly, or else... or else don’t blame us for being impolite!”

“Impolite?” Qin Yu laughed coldly.

“Just in time. I’ll kill all of you!” Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

After saying that, Qin Yu shook off Jia Gong and walked towards this group of people!

With Qin Yu’s monstrous momentum, this group of Inner Strength Grandmasters had no way to retaliate against Qin Yu!

Qin Yu raised his hand and used the Heaven Swallowing Technique. One after another, the Inner Strength Grandmasters died under Qin Yu’s hands!

In the blink of an eye, the office was littered with corpses and blood!

Jia Gong was so scared that his face turned pale. He trembled and said in fear, “Don’t... Don’t kill me. I’ll return the pill to you. Please spare my life. I beg you...”

Qin Yu didn’t say anything. He raised his hand and slapped Jia Gong’s head.

Waves of golden light rushed toward Jia Gong’s divine sense!

This was the soul searching technique! It forcefully searched Jia Gong’s memories!

Images appeared in front of Qin Yu.

In this image, Yan Jiang’s body was covered in blood, and he was on the verge of collapse!

He fell time and time again, but he stood up again and again. He used all his strength to kill two peak Inner Strength Grandmasters! He heavily injured Cao Shan and the others!

However, he was a mortal after all. Facing five Inner Strength Grandmasters, he finally collapsed.

The scene changed. When Jia Gong woke up again, Yan Jiang was already gone.

After looking through Jia Gong’s memories, Qin Yu’s anger suddenly deepened.

“You guys really deserve to die... Cao Shan, I will definitely tear you into pieces!” Qin Yu said through gritted teeth.

“Qin Yu, I...”

Crack!

Jia Gong was about to speak when Qin Yu smashed Jia Gong’s head into pieces!

The Yunchuan Martial Arts Association lost more than half of its forces!

The entire Martial Arts Association suffered countless deaths and injuries!

Qin Yu stood at the entrance of the Martial Arts Association and said coldly, “What bullsh*t organization is this? They are just a bunch of despicable people.”

He held the bronze sword in his hand and waved his hand. A monstrous wave of air surged over!

In an instant, the Martial Arts Association was sliced flat with a single sword!

After doing all this, Qin Yu turned around to leave.

Old Mister Yan, Jiang Gu, and Qin Yu arrived at the airport.

“Jiang Gu, you can go back first.” Standing at the airport, Qin Yu patted Jiang Gu’s shoulder.

Jiang Gu asked, “Mr. Qin, where are you going?”

Qin Yu thought for a moment and said, “The Divine Alchemist Pavilion.”

With Qin Yu’s current strength, he definitely wasn’t strong enough to go against the Yan family.

The only one who could protect Qin Yu was probably the Divine Alchemist Pavilion.

After bidding farewell to Jiang Gu, Qin Yu took Old Mister Yan and flew straight to Qinghe town.

Just as Qin Yu and Old Mister Yan boarded the plane, the Yan family quickly received the news.

In the office, four peak Inner Strength Grandmasters stood in front of Yan Sihai.

As Inner Strength Grandmasters of the Yan family, their strength definitely surpassed that of ordinary Inner Strength Grandmasters.

Each of them was a top-notch martial artist who could fight against many people of the same level.

“All of you, go to the airport of Qinghe town immediately and wait for Qin Yu. If you see him, kill him without mercy,” Yan Sihai said coldly.

“Yes, President Yan,” the four people shouted.

“Qiao Wu, remember, kill Qin Yu no matter what. Bring his head back to me,” Yan Sihai said coldly.

The man called Qiao Wu nodded and said, “President Yan, please don’t worry.”

After saying that, the four of them turned around and left the office.

At this moment, in the Han family’s home, Han Wei and Han Meng sat opposite each other while they were discussing something.

“Dad, Yan Sihai has already sent people to kill Qin Yu. Shouldn’t we also do something?” Han Wei said.

Hearing this, Han Meng slapped Han Wei in the face.

“Is your brain filled with sh * t? Even if Yan Sihai makes a move, he has to find a reasonable excuse, let alone us?” Han Meng said with a cold expression.

“Moreover, you and Qin Yu’s agreement has already been widely spread. If you make a move now, won’t it be a disgrace to our family?!”

Han Wei covered his face and was suddenly speechless.

“Just wait. With Yan Sihai’s way of doing things, Qin Yu will definitely die,” Han Meng said with a cold snort.

“I will bring you to the Yan family to propose marriage in a few days and set a date.”

An excited smile finally appeared on Han Wei’s face.

“Thank you, Father!” Han Wei nodded vigorously.

...

The plane flew past high in the sky, but Qin Yu felt a sense of unease inside.

It wasn’t just Qin Yu. Old Mister Yan was the same.

“I really didn’t expect such a big change to happen to the Yan family just a few days after I died.” Old Mister Yan sighed.

Qin Yu also forced a smile.

He couldn’t imagine what kind of world these aristocratic families lived in.

“Is power, wealth, and status really that important?” Qin Yu couldn’t help but ask himself this question repeatedly inside.

For power, wealth, and status, could people really resort to any unscrupulous means?

“I wonder how Yan Jiang is doing,” Qin Yu whispered.

Since he didn’t see Yan Jiang’s body with his own eyes, Qin Yu naturally felt a glimmer of hope.

The plane flew for nearly five times before it finally landed at Qinghe town’s airport.

As soon as the plane landed, Qiao Wu received the news.

They quickly hid near the exit and waited for Qin Yu.

After a while, Qin Yu appeared at the exit with Old Mister Yan.

“Should we make a move now?” Someone asked.

Qiao Wu glanced at him and shook his head. “This is the airport. Making a move here is equivalent to challenging the authorities.”

“Then... What if he runs away?” Someone asked.

Qiao Wu sneered. “There is only one reason for Qin Yu to appear in Qinghe town at this time, and that is to head to the Divine Alchemist Pavilion.”

“There is only one way to the Divine Alchemist Pavilion. We just have to wait for him near the Divine Alchemist Pavilion.”

Qiao Wu waved his hand and the four of them immediately turned around and walked out of the airport.

On the way to the Divine Alchemist Pavilion, they had to pass through a forest.

Qiao Wu and the others were waiting here.

With their strength, as long as Qin Yu appeared, they would be able to discover him immediately.

A taxi carrying Qin Yu and Old Mister Yan rushed towards the Divine Alchemist Pavilion.

At this moment, in the pavilion of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion, the Pavilion Master was discussing something with the First Elder.

At this moment, the Pavilion Master suddenly frowned slightly and his eyes could not help but look into the distance.

“Pavilion Master, what’s wrong?” The First Elder hurriedly stood up and asked.

The corner of the Pavilion Master’s mouth curled up into a smile as she said aloofly, “Qin Yu is here.”
