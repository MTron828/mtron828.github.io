1993 Killing two Semi-Saints

Those Semi-Saints fell out of the void. At this moment, facing the furious Qin Yu and Jue Wu that they could not kill, their hearts could not help but sink.

“Today’s matter ends here. Don’t go too far,” a Semi-Saint said.

The other few Semi-Saints didn’t say a thing. Their expressions were cold, looking for an opportunity to leave.

At this moment, the prince came forward to smooth things over, “Qin Yu, don’t tangle further. Let’s stop here.”

Qin Yu glanced at the prince and the Semi-Saint not far away.

The internal qi on his body began dissipating gradually, and the terrifying killing intent that lingered around his body also disappeared step by step.

The prince heaved a sigh of relief. The Semi-Saint not far away snorted lightly.

He looked at Qin Yu and said, “Qin Yu, you’re lucky to have escaped today. But you have to remember what happened today is not good for you.

After saying this, the Semi-Saint turned around and wanted to leave.

However, at this moment, Qin Yu, stepping the line word formula, suddenly appeared behind him.

By the time the Semi-Saint came to his senses, Qin Yu’s fist had pierced through his chest!

Everyone was shocked! Qin Yu actually attacked all of a sudden!

“You!” The Semi-Saint turned around with difficulty, looking at Qin Yu in front of him with his eyes full of disbelief.

At the same time, Jue Wu also rushed over with Glided Rake in her hands.

Her Glided Rake came down from above, smashing ruthlessly onto the Semi-Saint’s head and shattering it directly.

The perfect cooperation between the two had instantly killed a Semi-Saint!

The remaining few Semi-Saint looked awkward, but they knew it was no longer a good time to fight. They could only leave.

Qin Yu looked at the Semi-Saint on the ground coldly and said in a low voice, “It’s not a good thing for the Si family either. From today on, I will fight the Si family to death.”

After that, Qin Yu walked up to the prince, bowed slightly, and said, “I’m sorry. I don’t want to let him go.”

The prince opened his mouth but could only laugh bitterly in the end.

The Semi-Saint from the Si family who had come to take Qin Yu’s life died just like that. No one had expected to have such an outcome.

Yang Tong watching the battle in the dark also had a tremendously cold expression.

He snorted coldly and quickly disappeared.

Qin Yu’s internal qi began to dissipate gradually.

He walked up to Wen Da and Wen Er and stopped.

At this moment, Wen Er’s internal qi had already withered to the extreme as if he would die any time soon.

Qin Yu looked at the prince, bowed, and said, “I’ll have to trouble Your Highness to ask Master Yun to save my friend.”

Naturally, the prince would not reject. He waved his hand, and his two attendants carried Wen Er and walked toward Sky City.

Qin Yu squatted down and looked at Wen Da, who had already lost his life. He couldn’t help feeling sad.

Qin Yu Yu remembered how Wen Da and Wen Er had cared for him. If it weren’t for them, he would have died long ago.

Ever since he had acknowledged Wen Wanchong as his master, the three of them had been like real brothers. But now, Wen Da had died because of him. That heart-wrenching pain made Qin Yu’s body tremble.

“Wen Da, I’m sorry.” Qin Yu took a deep breath and slowly lifted Wen Da’s body.

Jue Wu, by the side, was even more furious.

The relationship between the two Wen brothers and Jue Wu was also not ordinary. Now Wen Da had died, how could Jue Wu not be angry?

Qin Yu carried Wen Da and returned to Sky City.

He walked straight to Master Yun’s residence and placed Wen Da’s body at the side.

At this moment, Master Yun was treating Wen Er’s injuries. When he saw Qin Yu, he said in a low voice, “Don’t worry, I can save this young man’s life.”

“Thank you very much, Master Yun,” Qin Yu said.

After that, Qin Yu looked at Wen Da’s body and said, “Master Yun, I’ll have to trouble you to preserve my brother’s body. I want to bring him back to Lizhou.”

Master Yun was silent for a moment and then nodded in agreement.

After that, Qin Yu and Jue Wu went to the Imperial Palace again.

In the Imperial Palace, the people sent by the aristocratic families were all terrified.

The powerful combat strength Qin Yu displayed in the battle terrified them. Their provocation earlier also disappeared without a trace.

Everyone was hiding in the corner for fear of provoking Qin Yu.

“My condolences,” the prince consoled him.

Qin Yu took a deep breath and said, “Your Highness, I’ll be making a trip to Serene South City.”

“Serene South City?” The prince frowned. “I’m afraid you’ll cause trouble to yourself if you leave Sky City now. Although I don’t know where the strength you displayed just now came from, I’m sure it’s not your own strength.”

Qin Yu was silent. The prince said it right. He was also not sure where this combat power came from.

Ever since Qin Yu started his cultivation journey, it had only appeared twice. Once was because of Yan Ruoxue, and this time was because of Wen Da.

“Let me go then,” Jue Wu said.

“I will definitely take revenge for Wen Da.”

The prince shook his head and said, “The culprit is the city lord of Serene South City. It has nothing to do with anyone else. Furthermore, Gu Xinghe has probably already run away. If I’m not wrong, he has probably gone to the Si family.”

Hearing the prince’s words, Qin Yu calmed down.

“Don’t be anxious. I understand your desire for revenge.” The prince patted Qin Yu’s shoulder and said casually, “Sometimes, people need to endure secretly.”

...

It was unknown if this sentence was meant for Qin Yu or the prince.

When compared to the destruction and decline of the royal family, Qin Yu’s pain seemed to be nothing.

“Alright.” After a while, Qin Yu took a deep breath and calmed down.

After this battle, Qin Yu’s name spread throughout the Holy Region. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

All the aristocratic families had also heard the news, and almost everyone in the Holy Region was talking about it.

“That Qin Yu actually killed two Semi-Saints. That’s terrifying!”

“Is he the Qin Yu who defeated the two brothers of the Si family?”

“Tsk! Tsk! With his talent, his future is limitless.”

“I think Thunder Courtyard will support him subsequently, will they?”

The nine great aristocratic families were even more shocked. Qin Yu’s appearance had completely broken their current structure.

Many heirs of the aristocratic families felt somewhat worried and pressured.

…

At the Cold Moon Palace, Saintess Gu was discussing dao with a cultivator whose face looked more delicate than a woman’s.

This person was none other than Yao Xi.

“Tsk! Tsk! Saintess Gu’s eyes are still so sharp. No wonder you’re willing to befriend him,” Yao Xi sipped his tea and couldn’t help but sigh and say.

“I wonder who you’re referring to, Holy Son Yao?” Saintess Gu pretended to be surprised.
