Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

These prayer beads rolled towards Heavenly Sin.

As the dozens of prayer beads rolled, the ground slowly trembled.

One scripture after another was imprinted on the ground. In an instant, the entire ground shone Buddha’s light.

If I don’t go to hell, who will?

Limitless Buddhist Scripture! These were people from the Faramita of the Buddha Realm. He did not expect Heavenly Sin would become more and more interesting. Even people from the Faramita of the Buddha Realm had joined in. Could it be that Faramita had taken a fancy to these sinners’ souls?

Cang Yunzi revealed a strange expression as if he didn’t understand.

The Faramita of the Buddha Realm was the final destination for those who cultivated Buddhism.

Only the strongest people were qualified to enter that world.

Its power had already appeared since the beginning of the Primordial Chaos. This power could even affect the overall situation of the world.

The Faramita of the Buddha Realm was a force that could not be ignored no matter which era it was.

Even Wu Tian Ancient Demon was one of those who had been expelled. Now that he appeared here, Cang Yunzi couldn’t help but be shocked.

“Perhaps, we have a chance to get out of this battle alive.” Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Amidst the Buddha’s light that filled the sky, the phantom of a Buddhist Sect kingdom tore through space.

A large blurry shadow appeared in the distant sky. The vast Buddhist Sect’s power bombarded Heavenly Sin’s body.

When the Buddha’s light landed on Heavenly Sin’s body, each strand of them exploded with immense power.

Every drop of the Buddha runes seemed to have the power to suppress the world.

Heavenly Sin suddenly stood up and extended his hand.

Immediately, countless curse marks appeared in the entire sky. Countless tombstone-like curse marks appeared in the space.

In the next moment, even the Buddhist Kingdom in the sky turned into dust.

The Buddha’s light that filled the sky instantly disappeared. Heavenly Sin appeared in front of the bald boy at some time.

He placed his palm on the boy’s head. In the next moment, a wave of power surged out from the tombstone.

That power was transmitted to Heavenly Sin’s palm. Countless runes wrapped around the bald boy and instantly turned him into nothingness.

Even the Faramita of the Buddha Realm seemed to be helpless against Heavenly Sin.

“Let go of your obsession. Heavenly Sin, everything is empty.”

The bald boy smiled.

He did not looked regret his failure at all. Instead, he was calm as if his plan had succeeded.

“I’m afraid that the reason why your true body descended was not to kill the sinners. The era has already begun to change, Heavenly Sin.” Boom!

A force descended once again, completely driving the bald boy and the Buddhist Kingdom out of this space.

The conflict between the Buddha Sect and Heavenly Sin only lasted for a short moment.

No one had been able to find out about the existence of this baldy before this, nor did they know where he came from.

For a moment, the entire arena returned to dead silence.

Only Cang Yunzi, Xiao Sheng, Lord Alester, Fatty Situ, and Qin Yu were standing.

All the people who attempted had died.

“What terrifying power! Is this the pinnacle of Dao?”

Xiao Sheng said softly.

Heavenly Sin stood still on the spot. Suddenly, a green light surged from the tombstone.

The huge stone tablet seemed to have transformed into a green lake. A wave of power shot straight into the blood moon in the sky.

In the next moment, Heavenly Sin’s power descended from the sky.

Countless runes poured down. All the places in the space that came into contact with the power of the runes were turned into nothingness.

Just like Fatty Situ’s Dao Protectors, even the powerful instant sword would immediately turn into nothingness when it came into contact with this curse.

This seemed to have completely surpassed all the energy in the Saint Kingdom.

Even Qin Yu’s Wings of the Night seemed to have encountered its nemesis facing this curse.

The two huge Wings of the Night started to tremble wildly. Qin Yu’s body also became more real all of a sudden.

“Heavenly Sin has disappeared! If we can block this attack, we might be saved!”

Fatty Situ’s face was pale as he shouted in a trembling voice.

“Xiao Hai, take a look at this punch of mine.”

Xiao Sheng raised his head and faced the power of the curse mark.

Facing the strongest power he had ever seen, he only punched out.

This punch didn’t trigger a huge force. It was just like an ordinary person’s punch.

He couldn’t even sense any energy fluctuations from Xiao Sheng’s body.

It was just like the previous attacks.

In the sky filled with purplish-black curse mark thunderbolts, the space where Xiao Sheng’s fist landed was torn apart.

Cang Yunzi’s face was filled with shock. At this moment, that fist that had no fluctuations of order had blocked the power of the curse mark for a moment.

Even if he tried his best, he could not do it. Who exactly was this man?

A moment later, the power of the curse mark completely enveloped Xiao Sheng.

His fist, head, and body slowly disappeared without a trace.

“Xiao Hai, I did my best.”

The radiance of Fatty Situ’s Heavenly Umbrella was already suppressed to the extreme.

Under the pouring of the power of the curse mark, the Heavenly Umbrella could not hold on any longer and began to crack.

Boom!

With a slight explosion, Fatty Situ’s body was completely shattered.

Cang Yunzi was the same as him. His power was simply unable to block this true power of Heavenly Sin.

“The Alester family has never been involved in a war. You can leave…”

A vague thought was formed in the void. The marks that filled the sky turned into a burning black hole, guiding Lord Alester to leave.

“This has nothing to do with the Alester family. I’m only here to swing my sword at you.”

Lord Alester raised her head. Her long golden hair rippled with a layer of golden waves.

Kacha!

A deep mark was drawn in the sky with a swing of her broadsword.

An invincible sword intent instantly shot into the sky.

The loud and clear sword chant reverberated between heaven and earth.

One had to know that this place was suppressed by Heavenly Sin’s true body. Even the voice could not be transmitted.

The sword intent at this moment directly broke this rule.

Even though Lord Alester was dead, the invincible sword intent remained in the sky.

In the sky filled with curses, this sword intent could not be calmed for a long time.

Heavenly Sin did not defeat her sword intent. She had lost due to her own strength instead.

Everyone was dead. Only Qin Yu’s lonely figure stopped in place.

Another word appeared on the tombstone- Four…

The space began to squirm once again, entering the fourth layer.

The curse marks that filled the sky disappeared in an instant.

At the place where the few of them had disappeared, four curse marks flickered for a moment but did not disappear into the void.

Qin Yu was in 20 different dreams at the same time now. He could see all of

them..
