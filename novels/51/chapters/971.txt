Qin Yu didn’t say anything, but he was a little worried. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Heaven’s wrath? What was that?

“Don’t think about it now. It’s too far away from you.”Tie Dan waved his hand.

Qin Yu took a deep breath and said in a low voice, “Yes, it’s too far away. We can only take it one step at a time.”

Even though that was the case, Qin Yu silently remembered this matter.

...

The next day was the day of the discussion Martial Hall’s reunion.

With tie Dan’s blessing, Qin Yu was finally confident.

He restrained his internal Qi and put on his black robe. Then, he left the hotel and rushed to the discussion martial hall.

At this time, the discussion martial hall was already packed with people.

Many martial artists came after hearing the news, from the strong to the weak.

Even many martial artists who rarely showed up also came to the scene.

For example, Han Xiu, Kong Yun’s father, Kong Luo, and so on.

Qin Yu tidied up his clothes, covered his face, and Strode into the martial arts discussion hall.

“Qin Yu!”

At this moment, Kong Yun caught up from behind.

When he saw Kong Yun, Qin Yu’s face couldn’t help but change.

“How did you know that I’m Qin Yu?”Qin Yu couldn’t help but ask.

Kong yun said somewhat speechlessly, “Do you think that no one knows you because you covered your face?”

“Qin Yu, you’re here too.”

At this moment, Xiao Yuan also walked over.

Qin Yu was speechless.

Damn, he was recognized one after another.

“Forget it. Since he’s recognized, there’s no need to wear these clothes.”Qin Yu took off his black robe and threw it to the side.

“By the way, do you know what Gu Xinghe is trying to do?”The few of them asked as they walked.

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “I don’t know, but it’s definitely nothing good.”

“Qin Yu, long time no see.”

At this moment, Han Xiu suddenly walked over from not far away.

Qin Yu nodded at him and said, “Do you still want to attack me?”

“Me? I’m afraid I’m not your match now, right?”Han Xiu said indifferently.

Qin Yu snorted lightly and said, “It’s good that you know.”

“I really didn’t expect you to grow to such a level,”Han Xiu couldn’t help but sigh.

Seeing that Han Xiu didn’t have any ill intentions, Qin Yu didn’t say anything more.

Moreover, the biggest enemies now were no longer the aristocratic families of Jingdu, but the secret realm, the Jingdu Martial Arts Association, and the Sky Blood Rainbow.

At this moment, Qin Yu suddenly felt a wave of hostility.

Qin Yu frowned slightly. He looked in the direction of this hostility and saw that the hostility actually came from Han Wei.

Meeting Qin Yu’s gaze, Han Wei hurriedly turned his head to the side.

Qin Yu couldn’t help but shake his head.

The current Han Wei was no longer worth mentioning in his eyes.

His hostility was completely ignored.

Then, Qin Yu, Xiao Yuan, Kong Yun, and the others strode into the discussion martial arts hall.

As soon as they sat down, Kong Yun’s father, Kong Luo, walked over from not far away.

Seeing Kong Luo, Qin Yu and the others stood up one after another.

“Greetings, Mr. Kong.”Qin Yu bowed and said.

Kong Luo nodded slightly to Qin Yu and said, “You must be Qin Yu. You’re really young and promising.”

Qin Yu smiled and said, “Mr. Kong, you flatter me.”

Kong Luo didn’t say anything more. He found a seat and sat down.

“I really don’t know what the Jingdu Martial Arts Association is trying to do this time,”Kong Yun said in a deep voice.

“I’m afraid that this meeting was initiated by Tian Xuehong,”Xiao Yuan said from the side.

Qin Yu glanced at him and nodded. “Yes, I’ve already sensed the abnormal internal qi nearby.”

This internal Qi definitely didn’t come from an ordinary warrior.

That faintly discernible internal Qi could not be emitted from a living person.

“I’m afraid that the Sky Blood Rainbow has brought an army of white bones.”Qin Yu sighed in his heart.

“It must be the people from the immortal slaughtering sect...”

At this moment, Tie Dan’s words appeared in Qin Yu’s mind.

Qin Yu grunted and said, “You know the immortal slaughtering sect?”

“Everyone knows the immortal slaughtering sect, which was at its peak back then. Even though the sect was wiped out many years ago, it has still been widely spread to this day,”tie Dan said.

Qin Yu said in a deep voice, “Then do you know what they are going to do?”

“I don’t know,”tie Dan said without hesitation.

Seeing this, Qin Yu didn’t say anything more.

He closed his eyes slightly and waited for the beginning of the banquet.

More and more people came to the martial arts hall, and many famous warriors also came here.

The disciples in the mystic realm were also like this. People Like Wan Gu Qiong and others had been waiting here for a long time.

Even they didn’t know the purpose of this meeting.

Just as Qin Yu closed his eyes, Gu Xinghe came from not far away.

He walked directly to Qin Yu and sneered, “Qin Yu, I didn’t expect you to dare to come again.”

Qin Yu slowly opened his eyes and said coldly, “If you don’t want to die, you’d better stay away from me.”

Seeing Qin Yu’s arrogant expression, Gu Xinghe couldn’t help but sneer, “I should have killed you earlier last time. I shouldn’t have been greedy...”

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and sneered, “I’m afraid you won’t have the chance.”

Gu Xinghe wasn’t angry either. He leaned on Qin Yu’s ear and whispered, “Qin Yu, I’ll let you know what it means to have overwhelming power and what it means to be toyed with!”

After saying that, Gu Xinghe patted Qin Yu’s shoulder and walked to the side.

Qin Yu did not take Gu Xinghe’s words seriously. He was about to close his eyes to rest when he felt a familiar internal Qi.

Qin Yu frowned when he felt this internal Qi.

“Yan Jinyao is here,”Kong Yun said coldly.

Xiao Yuan waved at Yan Jinyao and greeted him.

Yan Jinyao looked over and then walked over.

“It’s him.”Qin Yu’s face turned cold.

This internal Qi was very familiar to Qin Yu. It had his own internal qi and the internal Qi of the Yan family.

There was probably no other person besides Yan Jinyao.

As a proud son of heaven, no matter where Yan Jinyao went, he would attract a large number of gazes.

These young masters of the aristocratic families in Jingdu all stood up and greeted Yan Jinyao.

Yan Jinyao nodded one by one and came to Qin Yu’s side.

At this moment, Qin Yu was sitting while he was standing. Therefore, Yan Jinyao’s condescending gaze made people feel extremely unhappy.

“No Wonder Yan Ruoxue likes you. I understand now,”Yan Jinyao suddenly said.

Qin Yu raised his head and looked at Yan Jinyao coldly, waiting for him to continue.
