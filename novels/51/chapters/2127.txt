2128 The Arrival of Immortal Crane

Qin Yu walked over and bowed deeply to Saintess Gu.

“Saintess Gu, will the day of the Path of Heaven arrive in ten days?” Qin Yu asked directly.

Saintess Gu raised her eyes and looked at Qin Yu indifferently. She replied, “I heard there are traces of the Path of Heaven in Zhongzhou. It seems the day of the Path of Heaven is coming. As for whether it’s within ten days, I can’t guarantee.”

Qin Yu nodded. It seemed what the cultivator said was true.

After that, Qin Yu sat opposite Saintess Gu. He picked up the wine and took a sip.

“Mr. Qin, all the great aristocratic families are looking for you now. They want the Traceless Immortal Scripture from you. My Gu family is no exception. Now that you’ve come to the Cold Moon Palace, aren’t you afraid I’ll attack you?”

“I’m afraid, but I still want to gamble,” Qin Yu smiled and said.

“Oh? What if you lose the bet?” Saintess Gu raised her eyebrows.

“Even if I lose the bet, I’m not afraid. Since I dared to come, I naturally have a way to protect myself,” Qin Yu said calmly.

Saintess Gu’s eyes sparkled as she said with a faint smile, “Is Mr. Qin so confident?”

Qin Yu did not hide at all and nodded. “Yes, I do have the ability to protect myself.”

Saintess Gu covered her mouth and chuckled as if she did not doubt the authenticity of Qin Yu’s words.

“Mr. Qin has come from far. I’m afraid there’s something else,” Saintess Gu said.

Qin Yu nodded and continued, “I don’t know much about the day of the Path of Heaven. I only know that the chosen one will be selected on that day. But what else besides this? There were countless cultivators in the Holy Region. If it was just to see a cultivator being chosen, what did it have to do with them? The possibility of such a thing happening to them was very minimal.”

Saintess Gu put down the tea in her hand and said, “What you said is certainly correct. However, on the day of the Path of Heaven, the dao technique is the most profound. Many cultivators at a bottleneck will take the opportunity to break through.”

“I see.” Qin Yu was enlightened. “Has Saintess Gu participated in the day of the Path of Heaven before?”

“Of course not. The last time the day of the Path of Heaven arrived was tens of thousands of years ago.” Saintess Gu shook her head.

Seeing this, Qin Yu stopped asking.

“This can be considered a chaotic world. In the following period, we will likely face a major reshuffle,” Saintess Gu said.

Qin Yu raised his head and looked at Saintess Gu. Then he said in a low voice, “You mean…the nine aristocratic families might cease to exist?”

“That’s right. The nine super aristocratic families may disappear, but there will be new ones waiting for the opportunity to rise,” Saintess Gu said.

“I think the nine aristocratic families will do their best to protect their ruling position,” Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and said.

“It’s very obvious,” Qin Yu sneered and said.

After saying this, Qin Yu stood up and planned to leave.

“Mr. Qin, Saintess Yan and Si Shiyue will be engaged.” At this moment, Saintess Gu suddenly shouted.

Qin Yu stopped in his tracks and said calmly, “I won’t just watch this happen.”

After saying this, Qin Yu left.

Not long after Qin Yu stepped into Zhongzhou, he was targeted.

The moment he stepped into the inn, he sensed a killing intent.

Qin Yu frowned slightly, then sneered in a low voice, “You came quite fast. Since you’re here, don’t hide anymore.”

The lights in the inn were dim, and the door creaked in the cold wind. Instantly, a figure walked out from the dark with steady steps and a powerful aura.

“Mr. Qin, as expected of the chosen one of the current era. Your divine sense is indeed extraordinary.” The man’s lips curled into a cold smile, and his expression was full of hostility. He was dressed in black and was tall and his eyes resembled lightning.

Qin Yu stroked the teacup with one hand and said calmly, “Who are you? What grudge do we have against each other?”

The man smiled and said, “I am Qi Yunhe of the Qi family. Although the Qi family is not one of the nine aristocratic families, it is still a prestigious family. The Traceless Immortal Scripture with Mr. Qin is also very attractive to my Qi family.”

When Qin Yu heard this, his gaze was sharp and piercing as he looked straight at Qi Yunhe. “So it’s one of the greedy wolves. Aren’t you afraid of suffering double losses?”

“Do you think the Qi family will be afraid?” Qi Yunhe sneered and said.

“Maybe you guys aren’t afraid, but I think you should,” Qin Yu said expressionlessly.

Qi Yunhe’s eyes flashed with a hint of doubt. However, Qin Yu did not give him the chance to think too much. Instantly, he stirred up a powerful air current and rushed straight at Qi Yunhe.

“Qin Yu! You’re too arrogant!” Qi Yunhe shouted. His figure flashed, and he instantly dodged Qin Yu’s attack. A long sword suddenly appeared in his hand. The tip of the sword pointed at Qin Yu, and a powerful pressure pressed down on Qin Yu.

Qin Yu had a relaxed expression, and his eyes were like torches. He suddenly took out a small talisman and threw it forward. The talisman exploded in the air and turned into a burning line of fire, rushing toward Qi Yunhe.

Qi Yunhe’s pupils constricted, and he hurriedly swung his sword at the line of fire. The Spiritual Energy Sword and the line of fire collided, instantly causing an explosion.

The power of the explosion shook the entire inn. The flickering lights reflected the tensed appearance of the two. Qi Yunhe was knocked back a few steps by the force of the explosion, and his expression changed slightly.

Qin Yu, on the other hand, stood in the same spot, not moving at all. The intense explosion just now seemed not to affect him at all.

“It seems your strength is far from enough,” Qin Yu said indifferently, revealing a disdainful smile on his face. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Qi Yunhe’s face instantly turned gloomy, and his eyes flashed with ruthlessness. Suddenly, he moved and rushed toward Qin Yu. His sword technique became even more ruthless. Each sword strike carried a storm-like attack, instantly forming an inescapable sword net.

However, at this moment, a figure suddenly flashed beside Qin Yu. The person waved his sword, and instantly, the sword light was like a dragon, cutting through Qi Yunhe’s sword net.

“Hmm?”

Qin Yu and Qi Yunhe looked at that person almost at the same time.

The person was slender and had a cold expression. He had tremendously elegant white hair and looked like an immortal.

“You… You’re the mysterious person of the demon race!” When Qi Yunhe saw this person, his expression changed drastically!

Qin Yu also frowned.

It was none other than Immortal Crane!

“Qin Yu, you… you actually have an affair with the demon race. Qin Yu, you are a great enemy of our human race!” Qi Yunhe immediately shouted!

However, before he could finish speaking, Immortal Crane reached out and directly smashed his head.

Qi Yunhe fell straight and never stood up again.
