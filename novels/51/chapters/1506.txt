Chapter 1507: Chapter 1,507, the voice of Heavenly Blood Rainbow

“Dark energy?”Zhuo Jing frowned even more.

He pulled Qin Yu to the side and whispered, “Brother Qin, what do you want dark energy for?”

Qin Yu opened his mouth and hesitated for a long time, but in the end, he decided not to tell Zhuo Jing.

“In short... It’s useful. I need a lot of dark energy,”said Qin Yu.

Zhuo Jing said in a deep voice, “Most of the things that need dark energy are sorcery skills. Brother Qin, you...”

Qin Yu smiled bitterly. He didn’t know how to explain it to Zhuo Jing.

“If it’s not convenient, then forget it. Treat it as if I don’t have any problems,”said Qin Yu helplessly.

“That’s not it.”Zhuo Jing shook his head. He looked around vigilantly and said, “Brother Qin, no matter what use you want dark energy for, try not to tell others. Otherwise, you might attract trouble. Do you understand?”

Qin Yu nodded and said, “I understand.”

No matter where it was, the dark energy was something that people could not avoid.

And those who cultivated the dark energy were mostly extremely vicious people. It was very likely that they would attract a fatal disaster.

This was also one of the reasons why Qin Yu had been unwilling to go to the Thunder Academy. If he went to such a place, he would definitely expose the fact that he cultivated the dark energy.

“Thank you for your reminder, Brother Zhuo.”Qin Yu bowed slightly to Zhuo Jing.

......

Zhuo jing smiled and said, “This is nothing. Brother Qin, I will investigate this matter for you as soon as possible. Wait for me for a few days.”

“Okay.”Qin Yu agreed.

After that, Qin Yu didn’t stay any longer and immediately left the place.

The two of them exchanged tokens so that it would be convenient for them to exchange relevant information.

After leaving the Zhuo family, Qin Yu headed straight for Gu City. He planned to ask sister Lin about it and take the opportunity to see how she was doing.

Most of the treasures were obtained from ancient people. Sister Lin had been at the auction for many years, so she must have known about the relevant information.

Riding on the Godly Eagle, Qin Yu rushed all the way to Gu City and slowly landed in the palace of Gu City.

Seeing the godly eagle, the city lord of Gu City felt a headache.

“This Qin Yu... why is he here again!”The city Lord of Gu City gnashed his teeth and said.

Although that was the case, he did not dare to offend Qin Yu at all. He could only stand up and go out to welcome him.

After seeing Qin Yu, his expression changed and he tried his best to maintain a smile. “Mr. Qin, Why are you here?”

Qin Yu glanced at him and asked, “Where is sister Lin?”

“Oh, she is in the boudoir at the back,”the city lord of Gu City said. “I will go and call her now.”

“No need.”Qin Yu shook his head and then walked in the direction of the boudoir.

The boudoir was a house that the city lord of Gu City had specially built for sister Lin in the imperial palace.

There were mountains and rivers around the house, and the scenery was pleasant. It was indeed a good place to recuperate.

The setting sun shone on a long river in front of them, and there were waves of fog surrounding it. It was like a fairyland.

At the door, there were two maids serving sister Lin. They stood at the door, waiting for sister Lin’s instructions.

Seeing this arrangement, Qin Yu was quite satisfied.

He walked all the way to the door and said to the maid, “Is sister Lin Inside?”

The maid shook her head and said, “Sister Lin just went out.”

“She went out?”Qin Yu frowned.

“When will she come back?” Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

The maid glanced at the setting sun and said, “It shouldn’t be too long. Before the sun sets, sister Lin will definitely rush back.”

Qin Yu acknowledged, so he pushed the door open and walked into sister Lin’s room.

The room wasn’t big, but it had everything. On the table were the four treasures of the study and the words that sister Lin had just written.

Qin Yu looked around, but didn’t find anything unusual.

So, he found a seat and sat down, quietly waiting for sister Lin’s return.

About an hour later, sister Lin’s voice came from outside the door.

Qin Yu suddenly stood up and immediately walked forward to open the door.

Sister Lin was holding a basket in her hand, and there were some herbs in the basket.

These herbs were not old, but they were still filled with the fragrance of herbs.

“Qin Yu? Why are you here?”Sister Lin was pleasantly surprised when she saw Qin Yu.

Qin Yu smiled and said, “I came to see you.”

Sister Lin quickly pulled Qin Yu and said, “Take a seat. I’ll ask them to get some food.”

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “No need. I’ll leave in a while.”

After saying that, Qin Yu looked at the door. He pointed his finger forward and sealed the door with an internal Qi.

“What... is this important?”Seeing this, sister Lin also looked a bit solemn.

Qin Yu said in a deep voice, “Sister Lin, I want to know where there is dark energy, a large amount of dark energy.”

“Dark energy?”A trace of surprise flashed across sister Lin’s face. “Qin Yu, you didn’t cultivate some sorcery for your cultivation, did you?”

Qin Yu smiled bitterly and said, “Of course not. I Can’t explain it to you. In short, I need dark energy now. If sister Lin knows, you must tell me.”

Sister Lin was silent for a moment and said, “Wait for me for a while.”

Then, sister Lin found a leather suitcase.

She rummaged through the suitcase as if she was looking for something.

After a short while, sister Lin took out a map from the suitcase.

She wiped the sweat from her forehead and handed the map to Qin Yu. “I got this by chance during the auction. A divine halberd came out from this place.”

“At that time, because of the dark energy of the Divine Halberd, it was once considered an ominous item. It was placed for a long time before someone dared to take it,”said sister Lin in a deep voice.

She handed the map to Qin Yu. There was a light on the map that marked a certain location.

Qin Yu took the map, bowed, and said, “Thank you, sister Lin!”

Sister Lin smiled and said, “This is nothing. As long as you are well.”

Qin Yu smiled somewhat embarrassedly. At this time, he seemed to have thought of something and continued, “Oh right, I’ll have to trouble sister Lin to keep this matter a secret.”

“Don’t worry, I’m not a fool.”Sister Lin Snickered.

Just as the two of them were conversing, a violent explosion suddenly came from outside. Immediately after that, the earth shook, and the sky collapsed and the earth cracked. It was as if an earthquake had occurred!

Qin Yu frowned and hurriedly opened the door, looking outside.

He saw that the light in the sky was incessant, and the bright light had already changed the color of the entire sky!

“What... What’s going on?”Qin Yu frowned.

A large number of troops from Gu City had already headed to the scene. They followed the source of the internal Qi and sped away.

“Sister Lin, wait for me here. I’ll go and take a look before returning,”Qin Yu said in a deep voice.

After saying that, Qin Yu’s feet shook and he immediately shot out in a certain direction.

He saw three men standing in the center of Gu City.

They were all wrapped in black robes, and their bodies were emitting tremors of black mist.

There were many corpses lying around them. These corpses looked very much like he teng’s technique! Each corpse was extremely shriveled!

“It’s a similar internal Qi...”

Just as Qin Yu was running wildly, he suddenly heard a voice.

And the source of this voice was actually Heavenly Blood Rainbow!
