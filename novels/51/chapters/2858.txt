Chapter 2859: Let’s Make a Deal, Kid

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

In the haziness, Qin Yu appeared before Ling Kong.

“Hahahahaha!” Ling Kong laughed out loud. He covered his forehead with one hand.

His body trembled continuously, seemingly unable to hide his smile.

He had given up all opportunities in the Burial Heaven Cave.

Just to unleash this sword strike, he had merely consumed a portion of his opponent’s peak power.

“Kill me…” He knelt on the ground, his pupils losing all their luster.

“Trash.” Qin Yu walked past him without even glancing at Ling Kong.

Qin Yu looked down on this kind of person who collapsed with one strike.

He wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth. Ling Kong was indeed very strong.

Even though he had used the powers of creation, he was still injured by this attack.

However, if he collapsed just like that, then it didn’t matter whether he attacked or not.

Ling Kong laughed maniacally, his nails digging deep into his palms.

He, who had always thought highly of himself, actually experienced a day when he was instantly deemed useless.

The Night Qi flowed through Qin Yu’s body, but a sword mark was deeply imprinted on his chest, unable to completely deprive him of this power.

It seemed like he had reached his limit.

Qin Yu smiled bitterly. His peak power was almost completely exhausted now.

At the last moment, Qin Yu completely unleashed his power. There were already countless pairs of eyes staring at him.

“Come on!”

“Hahaha, I haven’t had this kind of power for a long time.”

The dagger in Qin Yu’s hand suddenly let out a surprised sound.

The God Source and Absolute Beginning Life Stone in his hands suddenly disappeared.

“Burp!” Sir Dagger burped.

“F*ck you!”

Qin Yu’s eyes instantly turned red. This was something that he had risked his life in exchange for, and it was swallowed by Sir Dagger just like that.

“Take it, take it. Look at your useless appearance.”

Before Qin Yu could finish his scolding, Sir Dagger finished eating the remaining two strands of God Source and the Absolute Beginning Life Stone.

Without giving him any time to respond, the dagger burst out with a strong light.

It was as if life was being nurtured, and a powerful internal qi erupted from within.

“Change in form? Sir Dagger’s second transformation!”

Qin Yu’s heart began to beat rapidly.

The first time the dagger transformed into a death scythe, that scythe move was his strongest trump card.

After devouring the power here, it seemed to have unlocked the second level of the seal.

Furthermore, Qin Yu seemed to have seen the embryonic form of a sword amid the powerful power.

However, even though the dagger had returned to Qin Yu’s body, he couldn’t get close to the sword.

There seemed to be a powerful force circulating it. When his divine sense approached, he felt a strong sense of danger.

If the dagger hadn’t fused with his body, he would have been severely injured in an instant.

“With that pathetic amount of energy, you think you can undo the second-level seal? Why don’t you go take a dump instead?” Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

In front of Sir Dagger, Qin Yu didn’t seem to have any secrets.

“No way. You swallowed so many God Sources and Absolute Beginning Life Stones, but they’re useless.”

Qin Yu couldn’t hold it in any longer and immediately cursed.

“Of course, I can still use a portion of my strength. Moreover, if I don’t consume this strength, you definitely won’t be able to obtain it…”

Sir Dagger left a sentence with a guilty conscience and didn’t respond again.

“How interesting.”

In the storm that filled the sky, Qin Yu suddenly saw the saber light flash fiercely.

The ghost fog and dark clouds seemed to weaken a little after the saber light struck.

Ding Ning’s figure appeared in the aurora.

“He’s using his saber intent to fight against the Power of the Ancients. Where did this swordsman come from?”

In the distance, Lord Sui, who was under the Eye of Destruction, saw this scene.

He left without hesitation. Even if he had the power of the Saint Supreme, he didn’t want to provoke such a terrifying cultivator.

Did it melt? No, that’s not right! The Absolute Beginning Life Stone and God Source should have been digested.

Two strands of God Source and an Absolute Beginning Life Stone appeared in Ding Ning’s hand.

He clearly remembered that the number was far more than this.

Someone coun’t steal something from him without making a sound. That must be the Power of the Ancients in this world.

Swoosh!

He tilted his body sideways and swung the heavy saber in his hand.

The saber light was unleashed, and the two generals in front of him were instantly torn apart.

The terrifying saber intent swam through the broken bodies, and in the next moment, the two generals completely exploded.

This was Ding Ning’s true terrifying strength, fully unleashing the saber intent within him.

Even a general with terrifying physical strength couldn’t withstand his casual strike of the saber.

Were you trying to exhaust us in this way? Then who was your target?

Ding Ning’s hand holding the heavy saber moved slightly.

On the blade of the heavy saber, strands of scorching red energy light circulated within.

Countless cracks extended from the suppressed blade.

“Kid! I’ll make a deal with you.”

The terrifying saber intent, cutting through the ancient power of the Ancients, clashed with the dense ghost fog and the Power of the Aurora.

Directly pressing against the neck of Qin Yu, this was the strongest saber strike in the realm of the Saint World.

“Fine.” Without much hesitation, Qin Yu nodded in agreement.

If it were someone else, perhaps Qin Yu could still struggle.

But now, it was Ding Ning, one of the top three swordsmen in the Saint World. The will in this power no longer allowed him to resist.

And here, Ding Ning was also an excellent target for him to protect.

Ling Bo!

Qin Yu’s body transformed into a falling leaf.

After a short moment, he appeared in front of Ding Ning.

“Before I open my eyes, block these small fries.”

In an instant, the saber intent under the heavy saber completely exploded.

A glaring light beam shot into the sky. Ding Ning, under the gaze of the onlookers, actually began to refine the God Source and the Absolute Beginning Life Stone, as if he had sensed this refining intent.

The wind and clouds in their space suddenly changed. Countless dark clouds flowed in the sky.

The ghostly fog in the sky was crazily gathering in this direction.

Qin Yu felt the increasing heaviness in his body.

This was almost the suppression of the power of heaven and earth. Qin Yu’s expression changed drastically.

“He also noticed that something was wrong. Why did the Burial Heaven Cave change so much when he refined the Divine Source and the Absolute Beginning Life Stone?”

His expression was extremely ugly. At this moment, the God Source in his palm slowly melted.

It was dissipating in his hand with an undetectable power.

This was something he had never encountered before. After obtaining the God Source and the Absolute Beginning Life Stone, they wouldn’t dissipate so easily.

However, the Burial Heaven Cave seemed to be trying to turn this place into an endless closed-loop space.

He used the power of a general to exhaust everyone to death.
