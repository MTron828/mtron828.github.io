Chapter 2836: Level 15 Peak Power

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

This power was something that even the Guardian valued.

Therefore, he had already decided on this marriage for Qin Yu when he was still on Earth.

When this power was still sleeping, even the will of the Investiture of Gods did not sense it at all.

The moment this power awakened, even the giant that could suppress the Path of Heaven behind its impulse was instantly heavily injured.

In an instant, Qin Yu’s body was like an erupting volcano. This power was no longer something that his cultivation realm could withstand.

Although he was only a carrier, it was something that Qin Yu’s physical body could not condense.

In the void, a vast amount of the power of sealing gods poured into Qin Yu’s body. Qin Yu’s divine soul had long been flagged on the Investiture of Gods so that no power could take his life.

For a moment, life and death were reversed.

On the contrary, the bloodline of the chaotic body and the Immortal Emperor would take Qin Yu’s life whereas the Investiture of Gods would do its best to protect him.

In between, there was also the remaining power of the dark Path of Heaven. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

The three forces were entangled together. In an instant, Qin Yu did not know how often life and death had rotated.

Qin Yu maintained his original heart. No matter how many times his consciousness fell into the Chaos, he still stood and recognized himself.

In this kind of life-and-death situation, it would be like losing oneself in the reincarnation cycle if one’s mind was not guarded. One could never find one’s consciousness again.

In addition to the power of sealing gods, there was the fusion of the chaotic body, the Heaven and Earth’s bloodline, and the dark power of the Path of Heaven.

They were all powers that were close to the power of god. The battle between these three powers was even more life and death.

The entanglement of these three forces was somewhat similar to his One Thought Reincarnation.

However, this was like a vortex of three ways of the Great Dao.

Even though Qin Yu’s mind was like steel, his consciousness was beginning to dissipate.

The whirlpool power of these three ways of the Great Dao divided his consciousness into thousands.

The connection between them was getting further and further away. They could not be connected at all.

Qin Yu’s consciousness became more and more scattered. He was like a person drowning in the sea, gradually unable to sense his existence.

In the distance, Liu Bai stared at this scene. He could not help but clench his fists.

“Stinky old man, do you think he can succeed? This person is the son of that Guardian!”

Liu Bai’s voice was trembling.

At the side, an old man and a young man stood quietly.

However, the old Daoist was not calm judging from his slightly tensed body.

“It was difficult to compete with three powers above the Saint. Perhaps we won’t be able to hold on for long even if we join…”

The old Daoist’s voice was a little low.

Liu Bai was silent.

Even if a Holy Consciousness cultivator joined the three powers, one would probably die instantly.

Qin Yu had found a trace of balance in this, but this balance would be directly broken once he relaxed his consciousness.

Another wave of power poured into Qin Yu’s body in the Investiture of Gods.

A needle-like consciousness came from it, wanting to wake him from the Chaos.

That was Xiao Hai’s consciousness. At this moment, the original consciousness of the Investiture of Gods had completely escaped. He was temporarily free from the control of the power of sealing gods.

At this moment, he suddenly sent out a consciousness. It contained his understanding of the power of sealing gods since he came here.

At the same time, a clear voice suddenly sounded in Qin Yu’s mind.

“Qin Yu!”

It was Yan Ruoxue’s voice!

“That’s right! I haven’t even found you! What right do I have to give up?”

In an instant, Qin Yu’s consciousness returned to his body.

He remained unmoved despite the three powerful forces constantly attacking him.

It lasted for nearly half a year. Qin Yu had experienced countless reincarnation and life and death transformations during that period.

Finally, a layer of golden power erupted from his body.

This power was fleeting, even surpassing the speed of light.

It passed through the entire Dao Mystical Saint Kingdom and the Saint World.

As the power shuttled, it did not stop even after traveling through the entire Saint World.

Instead, it continued to unleash a shocking attack towards the sky above the Saint World.

Then, it returned to Qin Yu’s body. In the next moment, a peak power was emitted from Qin Yu’s body.

“What a rich scent of peak power! It must be the peak power of level 15! It had even far surpassed Chen Zhisha’s!”

Liu Bai was shocked.

However, this power did not stop.

It seemed to have been attracted by some kind of power. Then it suddenly gathered in Qin Yu’s sea of consciousness.

The source of the power was the divinity.

It was the Nineteenth Prison’s divinity Sir Dagger had mentioned. At this moment, his peak power was wrapped around the divinity and slowly sank into it.

As the power entered his body, the internal qi on his body rose again.

A new universe seemed to have formed around Qin Yu. Countless stars lit up in the void.

The day and night represented by the stars were constantly changing.

As the peak power on Qin Yu’s body shuttled through, countless stars underwent a drastic change.

The disordered universe seemed to have awakened some kind of law. Countless fireflies appeared in the universe.

These light spots fell into the countless stars and some powerful changes seemed to have occurred in the stars.

“That’s the internal qi of a living being! His peak power can create living beings!”

Liu Bai said in shock. This was not something even the previous level 15 peak power could do.

This kind of power already involved the powers of creation!

“Great Creation Technique!”

The old Daoist muttered.

“Grandpa, what is the Great Creation Technique?”

The little girl was curious.

“This kind of power can only be possessed by the Path of Heaven. This is an iron law that belongs to every era. However, Qin Yu comprehended this power that transcends the limits in the balance between the three types of power. This power might be able to overturn the Path of Heaven, evolve the Qian Kun, and create miracles. Perhaps his appearance will light a candle for the entire human race.”

The old Daoist priest’s voice sounded a little lonely.

“Anyway, today must be a feast.”

The old Daoist raised his head and looked into the distance.

At this moment, a powerful force descended majestically.

Qin Yu’s power had already shocked the alien race to the extreme.

Once this power continued to grow, it would pose an extremely great threat to them. Therefore, the darkness arrived right after Qin Yu had awakened his peak power.

In the sea of golden Miracle Qi that filled the sky, one step after another appeared in the air.

Chen Zhisha slowly emerged from the sea of miracles.

“Gentleman, why do you want to blow out the flames of the human race?”

The old Daoist sighed.

“How can one person reverse the power of the Path of Heaven?”
