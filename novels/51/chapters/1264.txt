Chapter 1265: Chapter 1,265, the number one sect in the Southern Prefecture 

Qin Yu threw the demonic beast in front of everyone. Then, he clapped his hands and said, “It’s done.”

The young man frowned slightly, and many strong men surrounded him.

“It’s a scarlet rabbit beast,”someone said.

“Mm, it’s indeed a scarlet rabbit beast at the Mighty Realm.”

The young man glanced at Qin Yu and snorted lightly. “You’re quite good at picking. You chose the weakest Scarlet Rabbit Beast.”

Qin Yu spread out his hands and said, “I encountered it as soon as I entered Qingyan Forest. I saw that it was in the mighty realm, so I killed it conveniently.”

Hearing this, a trace of displeasure flashed across the youth’s face.

“It’s best not to be too vain, and also not to run wild with your words. Otherwise, you’ll easily be at a disadvantage,”the youth said coldly.

Qin Yu didn’t want to argue with him anymore, so he said, “Anyway, I’ve already fulfilled your request. Now, it can be considered as joining the hunter organization, right?”

Although the young man was a little displeased, he still agreed.

Then, he called over a brawny man and asked this brawny man to bring Qin Yu along. At the same time, he also explained the rules of the hunter organization.

The Brawny Man’s name was Guan Zhuang. His body size was extremely huge, and he was somewhat similar to Chang Mang. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Guan Zhuang is an old hunter and has rich experience. You had better follow him closely. Otherwise, if you die, I won’t be responsible,”the young man said with a cold snort.

Qin Yu couldn’t help but frown.

Why was this young man acting as if he had eaten gunpowder? His words were full of sarcasm.

“Brother, don’t be angry. Jing Bai only has this temper. He can’t stand those who treat this place as a place for fun.”Guan Zhuang patted Qin Yu’s shoulder.

Qin Yu nodded and said with a smile, “I understand.”

Guan Zhuang nodded and said, “Follow me.”

With that, Qin Yu followed behind Guan Zhuang and entered a house.

There were some protective gear and equipment in the house for the hunters to choose from.

“Although these equipment are not considered top-tier, they can protect your life at critical moments,”said Guan Zhuang.

Qin Yu took a look and shook his head, “I don’t really need these things.”

Qin Yu’s body was tougher than these protective gear. As for the equipment, it was even weaker than Qin Yu’s pair of Iron Fists.

However, this sounded a little strange to Guan Zhuang.

“Brother, don’t be too arrogant when you come to Qingyan Forest,”Guan Zhuang said with a frown.

Qin Yu smiled bitterly and said, “It’s not that I’m arrogant, it’s that I really don’t need these things...”

Even Guan Zhuang was a little unhappy about this.

He waved his hand and said, “You youngsters... forget it, you can do whatever you want.”

After saying that, Guan Zhuang turned around and walked out.

Qin Yu followed behind Guan Zhuang like a follower.

Although Guan Zhuang was extremely dissatisfied with Qin Yu’s performance, out of responsibility, he still explained the rules of the hunter organization and Qingyan Forest to Qin Yu.

“Usually, we have orders here, and you can pick them yourself. The more difficult the order is, the more generous the reward will be,”said Guan Zhuang.

“For example, the Red Rabbit Beast You killed is considered inferior. It can only be sent to a high-end restaurant or eaten by everyone. The reward you will receive is only a little spirit coin.”

Qin Yu nodded and said, “Understood.”

Then, Guan Zhuang continued, “As for those orders, they are usually sent by the major organizations. They will pay a certain condition in exchange for the demon beast they want.”

Qin Yu nodded repeatedly and listened attentively to Guan Zhuang’s explanation.

At this moment, Guan Zhuang took out a map. This map was the nearby Green Rock Forest.

On this map, the vicinity of the Green Rock Forest was planned out.

Guan Zhuang pointed at a small area that was planned out and said, “This is our hunting area. Remember, you must not cross this line of defense.”

Qin Yu frowned and said, “Isn’t this too small?”

“Small? On the map, it is small, but in reality, it is extremely vast. It would take hundreds of years to finish it,”Guan Zhuang said.

Qin Yu nodded. That was true.

After this journey, Qin Yu had a general understanding of the size of the holy region.

That one star could be a kilometer long.

“By the way, why can’t we pass through this line of Defense?”Qin Yu pointed at the line drawn on the map and asked.

Guan Zhuang lightly snorted. “If we leave that line of defense, we’ll just wait for death. The depths of the green rock forest are filled with primordial beasts. Not just you and me, even a peak-stage mighty figure or even an expert might not be able to return alive.”

Hearing this, Qin Yu couldn’t help but gasp.

Even a peak-stage mighty figure couldn’t come back alive? Was the Green Rock Forest that terrifying?

One had to know that the entire Li Prefecture was surrounded by the green rock forest. If that was the case, it was simply impossible to travel to the Central Prefecture on foot.

“Oh Right, Big Brother Guan Zhuang, let me ask you a question.”At this moment, Qin Yu suddenly said.

Guan Zhuang nodded and motioned for Qin Yu to speak.

Qin Yu hurriedly said, “Do you know about the Heavenly Cloud Sect?”

“Heavenly Cloud Sect? The number one sect in the Southern Region, why?”Guan Zhuang asked.

Qin Yu continued to ask, “Just how strong is this heavenly cloud sect? And what realm is the sect master at?”
