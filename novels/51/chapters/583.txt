Chapter 584: The Worried Yan Sihai Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

There seemed to be a huge change in the rankings this time.

Qin Yu didn’t recognize most of the names.

Ye Qing and Jiang He were still in the first place.

Kong Luo of the Kong family was in second place.

However, Han Xiu, who was in third place before, was nowhere to be seen. He was replaced by someone called Song Lun.

Further down, Yan Jinyao’s name had also disappeared.

Qin Yu didn’t see anyone familiar in the entire top ten.

“It seems that the ranking of the Martial Arts Forum isn’t accurate,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

After all, there were many low-profile powerhouses who hadn’t been included in the ranking.

Moreover, there was no Martial Saint in this ranking.

The second list was the power ranking of the younger generation.

This list had also undergone a huge change!

The person ranked first was Yan Jinyao from the Yan family! His strength was also marked on the list.

Currently, Yan Jinyao was already a rank three Martial Marquis and wasn’t far from the intermediate stage.

The second person was Kong Yun, who was also a rank two Martial Marquis.

The third person was Yao Meng from the Yao family in Jingdu. She was a girl, and she was also a rank two Martial Marquis!

Looking at this list, Qin Yu couldn’t help but feel a little surprised.

Just how many young masters from the aristocratic families hadn’t been counted?

Why was this list so different from the previous one? Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Continuing to look down, Qin Yu saw that he was ranked fourth! He was also the young man with the highest ranking besides those from aristocratic families!

Qin Yu’s appearance on the list wasn’t surprising. After all, with his battle results, even if the Martial Arts Association wanted to kick him out, it was almost impossible.

Looking further down, he saw people from the various aristocratic families.

For example, Chu Heng, Kong Yun, Zhuang Teng, and others were also on the list.

It was worth mentioning that the Chu family had two people on the list, Chu Heng and Chu Hedao.

Qin Yu continued to look down, and very quickly, he found a familiar person:

He Teng!

Currently, He Teng had also stepped into the Martial Marquis Realm! And he was ranked tenth!

“This guy is still alive.” Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and couldn’t help but snort coldly.

“If he dares to show up this time, I’ll take the opportunity to kill him,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

There were ten people on the entire list. Besides this list, there were eight more spots.

These spots were specially reserved by the Jingdu Martial Arts Association for ordinary families. Its purpose was to fulfill Mr. Zhou’s request.

This ranking might seem fair, but in reality, it wasn’t accurate. There were many people who hadn’t been counted at all.

For example, the seemingly unreliable man with a mustache. His strength was definitely not to be underestimated.

Moreover, Pyro was just too big, and no one knew how many low-profile geniuses there were.

The time was set to Monday of the next week. Qin Yu wasn’t in a hurry and he had plenty of time to make preparations.

“I wonder what kind of benefits this experience will bring,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

Currently, only by improving his strength as soon as possible could Qin Yu have the ability to challenge the Jingdu Martial Arts Association head-on.

“Once I understand the strength of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association, it’s time for me to take action,” Qin Yu said coldly.

Yan Ruoxue was still suffering in prison, which made it impossible for Qin Yu to remain calm.

Moreover, the Jingdu Martial Arts Association had always wanted to get rid of Qin Yu.

...

Jingdu Martial Arts Association.

On this day, Yan Sihai came to Qu Xie’s office.

Yan Sihai held a cigar in his mouth as usual, but there was a hint of anger on his face.

“Is the Jingdu Martial Arts Association a piece of trash? You can’t even kill Qin Yu?!” Yan Sihai said angrily.

“You keep saying that you’re the boss of the martial arts world, but in the end, you’re nothing!”

“President Yan, not only is Qin Yu an enemy of the Yan family, but he’s also the number one enemy of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association,” Xie Qu said in a deep voice.

“As long as there’s a chance, we’ll get rid of Qin Yu immediately.”

Yan Sihai snorted and said, “The Jingdu Martial Arts Association sent Yan Guiyi to kill him, but in the end? He didn’t kill him, and instead, he appeared in the meeting to stir up trouble.”

Qu Xie wasn’t angry at Yan Sihai’s rebuke. He smiled and said, “That was just an accident. You have to believe in the ability of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association.”

“No one can escape our pursuit.”

Yan Sihai said somewhat impatiently, “Don’t talk big to me here. I won’t believe anything you say until I see him dead.”

At this time, a young man next to Qu Xie said with a smile, “President Yan, hasn’t the Yan family been clamoring to get rid of Qin Yu since a long time ago?”

“I remember you said that Qin Yu is an ant in front of the Yan family, right?”

Yan Sihai’s expression turned cold. He looked at the young man coldly and said, “Are you mocking me?”

“I don’t dare to,” the young man sneered.

“The Yan family is a big family. Who dares to mock you?”

Yan Sihai slapped the table and stood up immediately!

He pointed at the young man’s nose and cursed, “Who do you think you are? Do you even have the right to speak here?”

The young man opened his mouth and wanted to say something, but Qu Xie waved his hand and interrupted him.

“President Yan, you came to find me for something,” Qu Xie changed the topic.

Yan Sihai glanced at Qu Xie and said, “I want to find a few bodyguards from the Jingdu Martial Arts Association. The stronger the better.”

Ever since he was threatened by Qin Yu, Yan Sihai had been restless.

Although the Yan family could hire countless powerhouses, the proud Yan Sihai had never paid attention to his own safety.

He didn’t even have a bodyguard by his side.

Qu Xie smiled and said, “President Yan, why do you suddenly want to find a bodyguard? I remember that the Yan family has a lot of Martial Marquises, right?”

Yan Sihai was filled with anger at the mention of this topic.

He snorted coldly and said, “The Yan family did have a lot of Martial Marquises, but I’ve driven them away.”

“Did you drive them away, or did they not listen to your orders at all?” The young man next to Qu Xie said with a smile.

“As far as I know, the Martial Marquises supported by the Yan family don’t seem to listen to your orders at all, right? They seem to only listen to the orders of Old Mister Yan and Miss Yan, right?”

“And... They seem to be in hiding. Only Old Mister Yan knows how to contact them.”

When he heard the young man’s words, Yan Sihai’s expression immediately changed slightly.

Just as the young man had said, the Yan family, as a top aristocratic family in Jingdu, would naturally provide for a large number of top martial artists!

These people were practically all single-handedly groomed by Old Mister Yan. All of them had extraordinary strength!

However, this was a secret of the Yan family. Even Yan Ruoxue herself didn’t know! How did this young man know about it?

“Speaking of which, I’m also a little curious. President Yan, as the head of the Yan family, how could you not know where the Yan family’s Martial Marquis Is?” The young man continued to ridicule.

Yan Sihai suddenly stood up and said coldly, “You’re courting death!”
