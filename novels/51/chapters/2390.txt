2391 The Immortal Grave

“Let’s take the Ni Temple of Heaven and leave. The people from the other aristocratic families will arrive soon. Moreover, the Golden Path of Heaven of the human race is about to descend completely. There’s no point to continue.”

He grabbed the Ni Temple of Heaven right away, and the overwhelming demonic qi bound the Ni Temple of Heaven like countless chains.

“You’re courting death!”

The head of the Ni family roared madly. This Ni Temple of Heaven had been passed down for countless generations. He would be too embarrassed to continue living if he lost it in his hands.

“Useless, it’s too weak.”

Immortal Crane shook his head. The Ni Temple of Heaven started to shake violently and slowly floated toward the Immortal Crane.

His face showed extreme anger, and he spat a mouthful of blood onto the Ni Temple of Heaven.

That was almost all of his blood essence. A person’s blood essence was limited. It was equivalent to spitting out all of his cultivation blood essence. Even if he recovered, he could not recover his current cultivation realm.

The Ni Temple of Heaven released a magnificent and dazzling display of lights, and numerous voices resonated within the temple.

The power of the world exploded in the celestial artifact. The temple actually advanced instead of retreating and crashed fiercely onto Immortal Crane’s chest.

“Boom!”

A trace of blood flowed out from the corner of Immortal Crane’s mouth, but that was all.

His divine sense probed into the celestial artifact and easily erased the divine sense mark of the severely injured head of the Ni family.

“Let’s go.”

All the demons jumped into the mouth of a giant chameleon and slowly disappeared into the air.

The Ni family’s celestial artifact was snatched away, the head of the family was severely injured, resulting in a drop in his cultivation realm, and the family suffered countless casualties and fatalities.

Although the demons retreated due to the arrival of the Supreme Elder, everyone understood that the nine great aristocratic families had eliminated the Ni family.

Even if they still had many treasures, the Ni family could no longer maintain their position after many casualties and fatalities.

The entire Holy Region was in a state of shock. All the great aristocratic families mobilized their experts to return to their families, afraid to be attacked by the demons again.

…

Time, sky, and earth seemed not to exist here. His body seemed

He had entered this place once previously, but his cultivation realm was too low at that time to experience the power of this immortal grave.

But this time, his divine sense had been numerous times stronger.

At the center of the immortal grave, he noticed a tomb that seemed to be formed by thunder.

His divine sense only swept across the immortal grave, but he immediately felt his body and soul go numb completely. It took a long time for him to recover. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Qin Yu was shocked. If not for the mark of Dean Lei on his body that the immortal grave had restrained so much of its energy, an enemy would probably have turned into ashes while sweeping by.

Was this the tomb of Immortal Emperor Lei?

“Qin Yu.”

An ethereal voice suddenly sounded in the immortal grave.

“Yes, Dean!”

“On the path of cultivation, ordinary cultivators will first cultivate a way, just like my sect’s disciples. Almost all of them learn the lightning-type cultivation methods. After familiarizing themselves with them, they will grasp the power of the way and gradually deepen it. The Way of Moonlight of the Ni family’s immortal scripture, the Way of Space of the Yan family’s immortal scripture, the Way of Five Elements of the Si family’s immortal scripture, and so on.

“All these powerful cultivation methods have one characteristic. It’s slowly tempering your soul and body attributes, allowing you to approach a type of way gradually. After the tribulation, you can go deeper into the sea of rules. You have a chaotic body, so you should comprehend deeply the various rules. No matter what Way of Rules you target, you should have a tremendously deep comprehension.”

Dean Lei explained it to Qin Yu slowly. He knew that Qin Yu’s knowledge of fifth-grade True Saint and above could not be lacking. After receiving this knowledge, he would have a clearer plan for his cultivation path.

“However, your cultivation techniques are too complicated now. As far as I know, Si Shiyue has the most Five Element Way of Rules among the human race. He has been in retreat since fifth grade and hasn’t come out yet because the contents of the five types of the Way of Rules were like a vast ocean. If he doesn’t master the changes and combinations in them, he will waste a lot of time instead.”

Qin Yu nodded. A person with top-notch talents, such as the evil exterminator, also cultivated four types of the Way of Rules.

“There are many powerful rules in your soul. Destruction, space, fire, and even the power of rules of the ghost race and monster race. You have a deep comprehension of space and can even evolve runes of rules. Your comprehension is even above Yan Tianshi, and I don’t know how you did it. However, your cultivation is not enough to unleash its full power for the time being.”

Qin Yu nodded, remembering every single thing that Dean Lei had said. After reaching fifth grade, no one guided him on his cultivation path. This was a rare opportunity for Lei Xin to point out his problems individually.

“I can’t solve your problem either because Flower Granny and I walked the same path to the extreme. The same goes for Immortal Emperor Lei. Your path means you will either go back to square one after the Tribulation Transcending Stage or walk your own path like Wu Ji and the masked woman.”

“Didn’t Wu Ji enter the path by destruction? It’s not one of the rules.”

Qin Yu asked with doubts.

“Before Wu Ji, no one discovered this rule, including those who cultivated the Destruction Rules. They also relied on Wu Ji’s comprehension to step onto this path. Let alone for the masked woman. She was the first person of Nine Paths Convergence. Although she seemed to be fighting back and forth with the group of people in purgatory, the gap between them would immediately reveal after the Golden Path of Heaven descended. Run away immediately if you bump into her. Her strength is enough to kill you instantly with a strike.”

Qin Yu’s hair stood on end when he heard Lei Xin’s words.

He knew the masked woman was very powerful did not expect her to be this powerful.

Moreover, although the masked woman had helped him several times, there was a fundamental contradiction between their stands, which was inevitable.

Lei Xin sighed.

“Listen, Qin Yu. I can’t give you the most accurate route in your current situation because I can’t see through your situation. Your father is also one of the experts in heaven and earth. Logically speaking, it shouldn’t have been a problem for him to leave you a set of god-tier cultivation methods, but he didn’t. I think he has a reason behind his decision.”

Lei Xin’s tone was tremendously serious. On the path of cultivation, one wrong step would lead to a series of mistakes.

Everyone wanted to become a miracle like Wu Ji, but since ancient times, there had only been one Wu Ji. Most people died on the beach.

He had always felt puzzled. With Qin Yu’s father’s strength, he had hidden a lot of information in Qin Yu’s sea of consciousness and set up many safeguards.
