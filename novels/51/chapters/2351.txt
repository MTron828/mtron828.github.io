2352 Another Duel

In an instant, countless Sumeru qi transformed into simple power of the way and shuttled through his spatial phantom.

With the addition of the power of rules, the shadow of the world suddenly became much clearer.

Outside that space, massive lightning bolts from the sky fell on this space from time to time.

There could only be one space in this world.

Even the Path of Heaven was wary of this condensed small world.

Teng Zixu, who was cultivating, suddenly opened his eyes. He looked at the thunderclouds and revealed a thoughtful expression.

“The Annihilation Domain!”

In the Sumeru World, the black fire burned on the ground.

This space was short of a portion of the Path of Heaven’s suppression, and Wu Ji’s power of annihilation erupted with its original splendor.

The terrifying black flames soared into the sky and transformed into two black dragons that blocked the two attacks.

These three attacks clashed, and a destructive internal qi instantly erupted.

The formation instantly turned into dust, and the bodies of several cultivators of the Yao family protecting it exploded into countless blood mists.

The ribs on Qin Yu’s chest cracked, and numerous blood vessels tore apart.

He spat a large mouthful of blood. These two heavenly might attacks were tremendously formidable.

Even if he relied on the primitive force of the power of annihilation, the impact he received was tremendously strong.

Yao Xi and Ni Wuxiao were even worse off. Their bodies were much weaker than Qin Yu’s.

The backlash of this power had injured them severely. If it weren’t for the fact that they both had many treasures on them, they would probably have died straightaway by now.

“You, how did your strength become so powerful?”

Ni Wuxiao said with a pale face. He and Yao Xi had used their treasures and the power of the Celestial Saint’s corpse to unleash the attack of heavenly might.

However, Qin Yu’s destructive power had also reached this half-step heavenly might power.

“There are many things you didn’t expect.”

Qin Yu’s body moved, and he had already appeared beside Yao Xi.

He broke Yao Xi’s hand with a kick, then grabbed Chang Mang and threw him into the Sumeru ring.

He stared at Ni Wuxiao. Ni Wuxiao’s face was ashen at this moment, and he shouted.

“Qin Yu, if you dare to kill us, Chang Mang will definitely die. This person’s life and death is dependent on our thoughts.”

“You must read it out then!”

Qin Yu’s killing intent surged. He was the person who had sent him into the spatial turbulence when he left the Holy Region.

And now he wanted to kill Chang Mang.

He would settle the enmity of life and death today.

Qin Yu threw a punch that contained the power of anger.

With the skeleton power of the glazed holy bone, the punch released a shocking qi energy, and it was about to blow Ni Wuxiao’s head up.

Countless magical artifacts lit up on Ni Wuxiao’s body, but those protective magical artifacts could not block the power of the glazed holy bone at all. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

They turned into countless fragments of magical artifacts and fell to the ground.

“Help!”

Ni Wuxiao let out a shrill scream.

A blade light suddenly blocked in front of Qin Yu, and that blade light turned around.

The force struck Qin Yu’s abdomen directly.

“Crack!”

Three of Qin Yu’s ribs broke. He spat a mouthful of blood, looking coldly at the person standing tremendously far away.

Teng Zixu.

“Is he that powerful?”

Qin Yu was secretly shocked. It was a similar ultimate attack of the heavenly might.

However, Teng Zixu could do it effortlessly. Not only did he not rely on any treasures, he also did not seem to have used his full strength, afraid of triggering the backlash of the Path of Heaven.

Moreover, that power was condensed to the extreme and only exploded in his body at the end.

“Since Brother Qin is here today, you can stay and cultivate in this Solitary Cloud City. I, Teng Zi Xu, can protect your life.”

Teng Zixu’s feet tapped, and his body seemed to have passed through numerous spaces, appearing before Qin Yu.

“Can you make me stay?”

Qin Yu wiped the blood from the corners of his mouth. The Sumeru World descended again, and a giant phantom suddenly spread out.

After obtaining massive Sumeru qi, the space in his Sumeru ring was completely restored.

The Sumeru World’s outward expansion was even more extreme. The Sumeru qi suddenly enveloped the Moon Listening Pavilion.

Suddenly, an extreme sense of fear surged into Qin Yu’s soul.

That sense of danger was not brought by Teng Zixu but by the dust and air in the space.

The void he stood in seemed to have turned into a speck of dust.

Around him were an enormous universe and stars that could destroy him at any moment.

“Is this the power of the Path of Heaven?”

Qin Yu broke out in a cold sweat. His Sumeru qi already had its own simple rules and attracted the attention of the Path of Heaven.

If it continued to expand, it would trigger the backlash of the Path of Heaven.

Just like his father had forcefully saved him previously, violating the rules of the Path of Heaven.

Father, did you face this kind of power at that time?

Qin Yu suddenly felt sad, but he immediately put away this emotion.

“Brother Qin, don’t force me to kill you.”

Teng Zixu casually slashed his saber down, but Qin Yu raised his hand to block it.

The power erupted again, and Qin Yu’s arm clashed with the saber light.

The power of heavenly might drifted on the glazed holy bone and blasted Qin Yu’s forearm into powder.

However, the saber light disappeared again.

“You’ve cultivated the legendary Glazed Holy Body!” Teng Zixu’s face revealed hints of shock.

The power of heavenly might could only break such a small piece of bone.

“When your Glazed Holy Body is completed, I really can’t do anything to you. How many attacks can you block from me now?”

Teng Zixu was not worried. He stared at Qin Yu with a smile on his face.

But at this time, his saber light slashed fiercely at Qin Yu’s head. He wanted to split Qin Yu’s hardest head and destroy Qin Yu’s soul power.

Countless black flames burned in the Sumeru World. The terrifying power of rules from the Degenerate Age enveloped the entire Sumeru Space.

Boundless chaotic qi surged out from the holy bone, triggering the power of rules.

If it were in the past, Qin Yu probably could not have triggered such a vast and mighty annihilation fire even after burning his blood essence.

He could easily trigger such a vast and mighty black annihilation fire now.

These destructive powers naturally posed no threat to Teng Zixu.

However, at least 80% of the people in the Sumeru Space would die!

“These cultivators are all warriors who will fight against the alien races in the future. Brother Qin, do you want to degrade yourself to be on the opposite side of the human race?”

Teng Zixu frowned. He did not expect Qin Yu to be distracted by focusing on a seemingly secondary objective.

“F*ck you, why are there so much nonsense?”

Qin Yu spat another mouthful of blood. He had suffered the power of heavenly might non-stop, and that vibration had also made him suffer severe injuries.

The annihilation fire suddenly burned fiercely.

Countless spaces were burned into black holes. Even the spatial qi could not withstand the ancient power of annihilation.

In this space, countless cultivators emitted intense and agonizing screams.

As Teng Zixu’s expression changed, his body had already disappeared.

In the next moment, he appeared in the black fire, and a surge of extreme cold energy emanated from his body, extinguishing the black fire.

When he returned to the formation, Qin Yu had disappeared.
