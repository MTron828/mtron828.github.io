Chapter 794: Chapter 794, the influence of a martial saint Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Everyone submitted to Qin Yu.

Qin Yu swept his gaze across the crowd, his face carrying an indescribable dignity.

Unknowingly, Qin Yu was no longer the weakling who needed someone to protect him in order to grow.

The current him was more like a superior. When faced with a martial artist who submitted to him, he had an indescribable calmness and calmness.

The pressure emitted from his body made people dare not raise their heads. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Qin Yu swept his gaze across the crowd and said, “From today onwards, all of you are members of the Heaven’s Gate. And the Heaven’s Gate will become the number one sect in the world, or even the number one sect in the world.”

His voice was not loud, but it was like thunder that reverberated in one’s ears, causing one’s entire body to shiver.

“Since you belong to the Heaven’s Gate, then you must abide by the rules. In a few days, I will issue the relevant rules,”Qin Yu said in a deep voice.

A simple meeting had established the heaven’s Gate.

However, Qin Yu knew very well in his heart that it was impossible for a sect to remain standing with just one or two words, and it was even more impossible for everyone to be willing.

Therefore, after sending them away, Qin Yu went to the medicinal herbs warehouse.

He spent a whole three days to refine a hundred pills.

This pill was called the Divine Seal Pill. It wasn’t considered a top-tier pill, but it was extremely useful. It could take everyone’s lives in its own hands.

Although this wasn’t the best method, it was the simplest and most effective method at the moment.

After refining the pill, Qin Yu gave the pills to everyone.

“Swallow it and you will be a member of our heaven’s Gate,”Qin Yu said coldly.

Everyone looked at each other. Although they were unwilling, they couldn’t do anything to Qin Yu who was so powerful.

After seeing the dozens of sects consume the pill, Qin Yu let out a sigh of relief.

The Xue family members couldn’t help but be shocked by how quickly things developed.

“From today on, you are the leader of all the major forces in the Sheng Kingdom?”Xue Yujie seemed to find it unbelievable.

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “No, from today onwards, there is only one organization in the Sheng Kingdom, and that is the heaven’s Gate.”

Xue Yujie smiled bitterly.

All the major and minor forces in the Sheng Kingdom had been fighting for decades, and no one had been able to unify them.

He did not expect that Qin Yu had spent a few days to bring all the major forces into the same sect.

This could not help but be surprising.

Not only Xue Yujie, even Qin Yu did not expect that there would be unexpected gains from this trip.

If it was within the fire country’s borders, it would definitely be detected by the JINGDU martial arts association.

And outside the borders, there would not be such a worry.

After experiencing this matter, Qin Yu also understood one thing.

That was the effect of power.

The reason why Qin Yu was able to take down all the major powers so easily was because Qin Yu possessed the power of a martial saint and possessed absolute power.

“How terrifying.”Qin Yu could not help but sigh.

Just the power of a martial saint had brought about such an effect of power. What would happen if he stepped into the true martial saint realm?

“Martial saint...”Qin Yu muttered in a low voice as a trace of longing flashed across his eyes.

The next day, Qin Yu planned to leave the Xue family.

The power of a martial saint could not be maintained for long, so Qin Yu did not dare to waste too much time.

After bidding farewell to the people of the Xue clan, Qin Yu left the Xue Clan.

“Where are we going next, Head Chief Qin?”The handlebar mustache asked jokingly.

Qin Yu said in a low voice, “We are going to visit a friend. After that, we will return to the Yan country.”

That friend was naturally referring to Yang Jing. In any case, it was on the way.

They drove all the way to the entrance of the Yang clan.

The Yang family was as big as ever. The huge manor showed that the Yang family’s wealth was not ordinary.

However, this seemingly grand manor seemed to hide a bit of decay and vicissitudes.

Qin Yu frowned and said in a low voice, “This Yang family looks a bit strange.”

The mustache man also muttered, “The entire Yang family looks ugly.”

Qin Yu didn’t say anything. He pushed the door open and strode towards the Yang family.

When he arrived at the door, Qin Yu knocked on it.

Soon, a nanny opened the door.

“Who are you looking for?”The nanny asked.

Qin Yu said politely, “Is Miss Yang Jing at home?”

“Miss Yang?”The Nanny Sized Qin Yu up and down, seeming a little surprised.

Qin Yu smiled and said, “My name is Qin Yu. I’m a friend of Miss Yang.”

The nanny nodded and said, “Please wait for a moment.”

After saying this, the nanny turned around and walked back.

A few minutes later, the door opened again.

The person who opened the door this time was none other than Yang Jing.

Yang Jing’s eyes were very complicated. There was excitement, surprise, and a bit of confusion.

“What? Don’t you recognize me?”Qin Yu said jokingly.

Yang Jing wiped her tears and said, “Come in quickly.”

Qin Yu walked into the Yang family with his handlebar mustache.

Yang Jing quickly served Qin Yu Tea. Although she tried to hide her emotions, she couldn’t Escape Qin Yu’s eyes.

Qin Yu took a sip of tea and said, “Did something happen to you?”

Yang Jing’s expression froze, then she shook her head with a smile and said, “What could have happened to me?”

Qin Yu raised his eyebrows. “Really?”

Yang Jing quickly nodded. “Really. I’m doing quite well now.”

“If you have any problems, you can tell Qin Yu. He’s very powerful now. He’ll definitely be able to solve them for you,”the Mustache Man said with a smile.

Yang Jing smiled and didn’t take it seriously.

“By the way, Where’s your father? How’s his health?”Qin Yu asked.

Yang Jing smiled and said, “My dad is fine. He recently returned to China.”

“You’re the only one living here?”Qin Yu was a little surprised.

“More or less,”Yang Jing said with a smile.

Then, the atmosphere fell into a short period of awkwardness.

Time flew by. At noon, Yang Jing had no intention of staying.

“Miss Yang, we came all the way here. Aren’t you going to treat us to a meal?”Qin Yu leaned against the sofa and said with a smile.

A trace of panic flashed across Yang Jing’s face.

She said with some embarrassment, “Qin Yu, i. . . Let’s go out and eat.”

“No need. Let’s eat at your house. Just Eat Something,”Qin Yu said shamelessly.

Hearing this, the panic on Yang Jing’s face became more obvious.

She said anxiously, “I. . . Let’s go out and eat. Let’s go quickly...”

Qin Yu snorted, “Miss Yang, if you don’t tell me what happened to the Yang family, I won’t leave.”

Seeing this, Yang Jing couldn’t help but bite her lips.

The nanny at the side couldn’t stand it anymore. She walked forward and said, “You should go quickly. Otherwise, if young master Huang sees you, he will kill you all! And then Miss Yang will be implicated!”

After saying that, the nanny even took out two hundred Yuan and placed it on the table. She said, “Consider it my treat. Hurry up and leave!”
