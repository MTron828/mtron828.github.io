Chapter 1462: Chapter 1,462, Mo family’s gambling city 1

Qin Yu was stunned. He hurriedly looked at the rough man and subconsciously grabbed his arm. “You... What did you say? Fang Fang and the others... were killed? !”

“Yes, I heard that they offended the MO family. The Mo family sent three mighty figures to kill them in the Green Rock Forest. They didn’t even leave behind their corpses,”the rough man continued.

Qin Yu unconsciously took a few steps back, and his expression became even more unsightly.

“The Mo family...”Qin Yu muttered in a low voice.

At this moment, his heart was extremely complicated.

Anger and guilt surged into his heart.

The members of the Mo family must have blamed Fang Fang and the others.

They didn’t dare to find trouble with Qin Yu, so they killed Fang and the others to vent their anger.

“It’s all my fault...”Qin Yu let out a long sigh.

Qin Yu should have thought of this. If he had brought them to the hunter organization earlier, such a tragedy wouldn’t have happened.

“Do you know where the Mo family is?”Qin Yu looked at the rough man.

The rough man scratched his head and pointed forward. “It’s in the Mo family city ahead.”

Qin Yu nodded and said, “Thank you.”

Then, Qin Yu flipped his palm and took out a pill, handing it to the rough man.

“This is the eternal pill, which contains extremely strong spiritual energy. Take it as a thank you,”said Qin Yu.

The Rough Man took the eternal pill, and a trace of shock appeared on his face.

“Thank... Thank you, Mr. Qin!”The rough man hurriedly cupped his hands.

Qin Yu did not stay any longer. He summoned the Divine Eagle and rushed towards Mo Jia Cheng.

On the way, Qin Yu was constantly reflecting on himself.

During this period of time, many people had already been affected by Qin Yu. At worst, they would be suppressed, and at worst, they would lose their lives.

And many of these tragic cases could have been completely avoided. It was only because of his own negligence that the consequences had resulted.

Qin Yu took a deep breath and looked at the direction of the Mo family city with an ice-cold gaze.

The godly eagle was extremely fast and soon arrived near the Mo family city.

The Mo family city was quite prosperous. Although it couldn’t be compared to Gu City, it was still bustling with people.

Qin Yu put away the godly eagle and strode into the Mo family city.

In the Mo family city, there was an extremely huge gambling success. It was said that the daily flow of money in this gambling city was tens of millions of spirit coins.

More than half of the Mo family’s income came from this gambling city

Qin Yu went straight to the gambling city. He raised his head and looked at the sign. After confirming that it was correct, he strode into it.

Not long after Qin Yu stepped into the gambling city, someone recognized Qin Yu’s identity.

And the person in charge of the Mo family’s grounds soon discovered Qin Yu.

“Is that Person Qin Yu?”In the dark, a white-clothed elder pointed in Qin Yu’s direction and asked.

Another person frowned and said, “It seems to be him. Why is he here?”

“He’s probably here to play,”the white-clothed old man guessed.

However, another person shook his head and said, “That’s not right. We just killed Fang Fang and the others, and he came here. I’m afraid he’s here to look for trouble.”

“Hahaha!”The white-clothed old man shook his head. “That Fang Fang or whatever is just an insignificant small figure. Why would qin yu go to such great lengths for them and specially make a trip to the Mo family town? You’re thinking too much.”

“Even though that’s the case, it’s better to be safe than sorry. It’s better to report it to the family head.”

With that, he turned around and left.

Mo family.

This young man walked in with quick steps.

“Hammer, what are you doing here?”A woman with a graceful figure asked.

This woman was beautiful, and there was a trace of unconcealable power between her brows. She must have a high status in the Mo family.

The young man called Hammer glanced at him and said, “I’m looking for the family head for an urgent matter.”

“The family head is currently busy and doesn’t have the time to see you,”the woman said indifferently.

Hammer said coldly, “Then I’ll have to trouble you to inform him that Qin Yu has arrived and is currently in Las Vegas.” Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“Qin Yu? is that the Qin Yu Who Killed Young Master?”After hearing these words, a trace of surprise flashed in the woman’s eyes.

“That’s right.”Hammer said coldly, “Whether you want to report it or not, it’s up to you.”

This woman naturally did not dare to be negligent. She immediately brought hammer and quickly walked towards the Mo family’s backyard.

In the backyard, an old man dressed in fireworks was sitting upright under a huge rock with his eyes closed as he cultivated.

One could see that this huge rock was emitting a faint radiance. This radiance covered the old man’s body and emitted a fog-like aura.

This huge rock was the Mo family’s ancestral treasure.

It was said that this treasure was no less precious than the Heavenly Cloud Sect’s sect master’s enlightenment tree.

And this old man was none other than the Mo family’s sect master, Mo Hong.

“Sect master, something has happened.”The woman quickly walked in front of him and said in a low voice.

Mo Hong slowly opened his eyes and said, “Didn’t I tell you not to disturb me while I’m cultivating?”

The woman frowned slightly and whispered, “Qin Yu is here.”

As soon as she said this, Mo Hong’s expression changed slightly, but it quickly eased up.

“Where is he now?”Mo Hong asked casually.

Hammer at the side hurriedly said, “He’s in our gambling city.”

Upon hearing this, Mo Hong said indifferently, “Our Mo family’s gambling city is famous throughout the world. He’s most likely attracted here.”
