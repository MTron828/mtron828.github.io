The terrifying wave of internal qi caused the few people present to frown.

Even Yan Guiyi could sense a trace of danger from the internal qi.

His expression turned cold, and the energy in his body erupted. He looked at Qin Yu with a grave expression!

“Rumble...”

The ball of light was still condensing in Qin Yu’s palm. The ball of light grew bigger and bigger. At a glance, it was like a huge sun!

Qin Yu looked coldly at Yan Guiyi.

“In such a small space, even if you want to hide, there’s nowhere to hide,” Qin Yu said coldly.

Yan Guiyi narrowed his eyes and said, “Hide? I don’t need to hide. Bring it on!”

Qin Yu didn’t say anything more. He shouted angrily and smashed the ball of light in his hand at Yan Guiyi!

In an instant, the blazing white light blocked everyone’s vision!

At that moment, it was as if a sun had fallen from the sky. The rumbling airwaves shook the entire space until it buzzed!

“Bring it on!” Yan Guiyi roared angrily. His entire body was enveloped by the black-gold light, and his hands ruthlessly pushed towards the huge ball of light!

“Boom!”

A huge explosion sounded! Yan Guiyi relied on his armor to withstand it!

“Clang!” Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

The huge impact force forced Yan Guiyi back dozens of meters!

Not only that, but his black-gold armor was destroyed!

Yan Guiyi’s expression changed. He shouted angrily and his hands were immediately wrapped by inner strength. He tried his best to attack the ball of light!

“Rumble...”

This confrontation between Martial Marquises caused the surroundings to collapse!

The veins on Yan Guiyi’s forehead bulged. He couldn’t see anything but a vast expanse of whiteness!

“Ah!!”

Yan Guiyi roared again and again. It could be seen that this technique was putting a lot of pressure on him!

The veins on his arms bulged, and his body was constantly being suppressed downwards.

Even the armor on his body was cracking at this moment!

“Break!”

With Yan Guiyi’s furious roar, the internal qi on his body burst out to the extreme!

The ball of light finally began to disappear slowly.

Yan Guiyi panted heavily with cold sweat kept flowing down his forehead.

He wiped the sweat off his forehead and sneered. “Qin Yu, I have to say, this technique has caused me a lot of trouble, but it’s not difficult for me to overcome! You...”

Before Yan Guiyi could finish his words, he frowned.

The four people who used the spatial technique also looked a little lost.

“Where is he?!” Yan Guiyi shouted angrily.

“We... We don’t know either,” the four people said awkwardly.

Where was Qin Yu?

However, the spatial barrier had a huge opening, and Qin Yu had long disappeared without a trace!

“He actually took advantage of this opportunity to escape.” Yan Guiyi’s expression was somewhat unsightly.

Only at this moment did he realize that the purpose of the ball of light wasn’t to repel him, but to draw his attention and let him escape!

“I’ve been played by him.” Yan Guiyi took a deep breath with veins bulging on his forehead.

Anger made his face turn ashen.

At this moment, Qin Yu was speeding away.

“Idiot, who wants to fight you to the end?” Qin Yu snorted as he fled.

Qin Yu didn’t know the level of Yan Guiyi’s strength.

However, Qin Yu knew very well that even if Yan Guiyi couldn’t kill him, the Jingdu Martial Arts Association had countless methods to catch him.

Qin Yu only stopped after running for several kilometers.

He took a deep breath and frowned. “The intermediate stage of the Martial Marquis realm can still put immense pressure on me.”

Qin Yu speculated that if they were to fight to the death, it was hard to say who would win or lose.

However, even if he won against Yan Guiyi, he would probably be heavily injured.

At that time, it would be very easy for the Jingdu Martial Arts Association to capture him.

Yan Guiyi tried to find Qin Yu again, but found that his spell had failed.

After all, what he got was only a strand of Qin Yu’s hair. It couldn’t last for long.

“Phew.”

Yan Guiyi looked a little unhappy.

This was the first time he had failed.

“Interesting.” Yan Guiyi snorted.

He looked at the person next to him and said, “Call the local authorities to look for him.”

“Yes, Mr. Yan.” The person next to him hurriedly nodded.

...

For the next two days, Qin Yu didn’t stop for even a second.

On the third day, Qin Yu finally arrived at the airport in Jingdu.

Qin Yu was going to accompany the Pavilion Master to attend a meeting today.

Although he didn’t know what kind of meeting it was, Qin Yu believed that the Pavilion Master would never harm him.

After waiting there for more than an hour, Qin Yu finally saw the Pavilion Master.

“Pavilion Master!” Qin Yu quickly walked forward and greeted her.

The Pavilion Master sized up Qin Yu from head to toe. After confirming that Qin Yu was fine, she nodded and said, “You haven’t encountered any trouble these few days, right?”

Qin Yu smiled bitterly and said, “The Jingdu Martial Arts Association sent someone called Yan Guiyi.”

Hearing Yan Guiyi’s name, the Pavilion Master frowned.

“Did you meet him?” The Pavilion Master asked.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “Yes, this person’s strength is astonishing. Even if I tried my best, I might not be able to kill him.”

Hearing this, the Pavilion Master couldn’t help but feel a little surprised.

Then, she said, “I really didn’t expect you to develop to this level.”

“Yan Guiyi is very famous in the Jingdu Martial Arts Association. He was the one who captured many internationally famous Martial Marquises. If you kill him, the Jingdu Martial Arts Association will probably be in an uproar.”

Qin Yu said coldly, “The next time I see him, I will definitely kill him.”

The Pavilion Master smiled and said, “It’s about time. We should set off.”

The two of them hailed a cab and rushed to the venue.

On the way, Qin Yu couldn’t help but ask, “Pavilion Master, what kind of meeting are we attending?”

The Pavilion Master said in a deep voice, “A very important meeting with a big shot.”

Big shot?

Even the Pavilion Master called him a big shot. This meeting was probably very significant.

After driving for two hours, the car finally stopped in front of a venue.

The venue wasn’t huge, but it was magnificent.

The cars parked at the entrance weren’t luxury cars. Most of them were Audi A6, Volkswagen, and other models.

“This is the place,” said the Pavilion Master.

She glanced at Qin Yu and said, “Later, remember to restrain your temper and not speak carelessly. Otherwise, you will arouse trouble.”

Hearing the Pavilion Master’s words, Qin Yu understood something.

This meeting was likely going to be attended by political officials.

“I understand.” Qin Yu nodded.

At this moment, another car drove over from not far away.

The moment the car parked, Qin Yu saw a familiar figure.

This person was none other than Xia Hang!

Beside him, there was an old man in a white robe.
