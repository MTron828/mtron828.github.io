Chapter 283: As Expected of His Descendant Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

The old man’s internal qi was extremely strong. Although one couldn’t feel the fluctuations of his internal qi, they still didn’t dare to underestimate him.

When Qin Yu saw this person, his expression changed slightly.

“Master Gu!” Jiang Gu was the first to call out.

The person who came was none other than Gu Taichu, a person who was practically omnipotent in Jiang Bei!

“Gu... Gu Taichu?” The others’ expressions changed drastically!

Gu Taichu had released the news that he wanted to kill Qin Yu, but he never showed up.

They didn’t expect that he would appear in the Gu family’s home today!

“You’re Qin Yu?” Gu Taichu looked at Qin Yu.

Qin Yu was neither servile nor overbearing. He nodded and said, “That’s right.”

“You two are too alike!” Gu Taichu sized up Qin Yu and said mysteriously.

Qin Yu frowned and said, “Alike? What do you mean?”

Gu Taichu didn’t explain and just walked towards Qin Yu step by step.

“Master Gu!” Seeing this, Jiang Gu hurriedly took a step forward.

“Sit down.”

Jiang Gu was about to say something when Gu Taichu raised his big hand and pressed it towards Jiang Gu.

Jiang Gu suddenly sat down and couldn’t even move!

“How strong...” Jiang Gu’s expression was extremely ugly.

Qin Yu also saw how powerful Gu Taichu was. Without the support of the ancestor’s power, it would be difficult for Qin Yu to defeat Gu Taichu.

Gu Taichu walked to Qin Yu in a few steps. One was tall and the other was short. Their eyes met.

Gu Taichu’s powerful internal qi made everyone present tremble.

Only Qin Yu’s expression was calm. He was neither arrogant nor aggressive.

The internal qi on Gu Taichu’s body suddenly burst out!

In an instant, the pavilion was overturned!

Everyone present, except for Jiang Gu, vomited blood continuously!

Qin Yu could clearly feel the pressure. He immediately circulated his qi energy and formed a confrontation with Gu Taichu.

Qin Yu’s body didn’t move, and there was no expression on his face.

This surprised Gu Tai Chu.

He laughed and said, “Yes, you’re really too similar! Even your expressions and actions are exactly the same! Hahaha!”

Qin Yu said coldly, “What exactly do you mean by that?!” Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Gu Tai Chu didn’t answer this question. Instead, he asked, “What realm are you at now?”

Qin Yu frowned and answered truthfully, “In terms of a martial artist’s realm, I’m at the peak of the Inner Strength Master Hands level.”

Gu Taichu thought for a moment and said, “Peak of the Foundation Establishment Stage?”

Qin Yu’s expression immediately changed!

Here came another immortal cultivator who had strayed from the martial path!

“You know quite a lot,” Qin Yu said coldly.

Gu Taichu put his hands behind his back and said indifferently, “Go back. In three days, I will visit you. I hope you won’t disappoint me.”

Visit him!

It was obvious that he was going to attack Qin Yu!

“Master Gu... please show mercy!” Jiang Gu said with some pleading.

However, Gu Taichu raised his head to look at the sky and murmured, “I really didn’t expect to meet his descendant...”

At this point, Gu Taichu suddenly turned to Qin Yu and said indifferently, “I won’t bully you. I’ll suppress my realm to the peak of the Foundation Establishment Stage and fight with you.”

Qin Yu’s pupils dilated!

Gu Taichu actually wanted to suppress his own strength?

This... This was too gentlemanly...

“Are you serious?” Qin Yu frowned and said.

Gu Taichu said indifferently, “I, Gu Taichu, never lie.”

“Okay.” Qin Yu smiled.

“You’re the most gentlemanly opponent I have ever met,” Qin Yu said.

Gu Taichu didn’t say anything. He took a step forward and disappeared in front of everyone in the blink of an eye.

“How fast!” Qin Yu’s expression changed drastically!

This was akin to shrinking the ground into an inch! Even Yan Jiang wouldn’t be able to do this!

“Gu Taichu... isn’t as simple as he seems,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

Then, he turned to look at Jiang Gu and said, “I’ll take my leave first.”

Jiang Gu hurriedly stopped Qin Yu and said anxiously, “Gu Taichu’s strength is beyond imagination. Why don’t we... apologize to him?”

Qin Yu smiled and said, “I’m not afraid of anyone on the same level.”

After saying this, Qin Yu ignored Jiang Gu and turned to leave.

Since Gu Taichu was so particular, there was naturally no need for Qin Yu to set up a formation.

He sat at home and quietly waited for Gu Taichu to come to his house.

This news quickly spread throughout Chuzhou and even the Jiang Bei region!

Reporters from the Jiang Bei Martial Arts Association rushed to Chuzhou and even hid in the dark near Qin Yu’s house.

On the other side, in Jiang Bei’s Bin Province.

Gu Taichu went to Jiang Bei alone and didn’t bring any disciples.

The entire Gu family home was under the watch of Gu Taichu’s eldest disciple, Chi Feng.

At this moment, Chi Feng was tiptoeing into Gu Taichu’s room.

This room was where the Enlightenment Tea was located.

All along, Chi Feng had been making tea for Gu Taichu.

However, Chi Feng had no idea that this wasn’t ordinary tea!

Ever since Gu Taichu had told him about it, he had always coveted this Enlightenment Tea, but he had no chance!

And today, the opportunity had finally arrived!

He opened the cabinet and quickly discovered the three pieces of Enlightenment Tea inside.

“Fortunately, it’s still there!” Chi Feng’s eyes lit up as he stared at the Enlightenment Tea!

Following that, Chi Feng directly grabbed the three pieces of tea, stuffed them all into his mouth, and began to chew.

When the Enlightenment Tea entered his stomach, Chi Feng’s eyes instantly turned red!

He felt as if his entire body was bursting with an internal qi that didn’t belong to him!

Even his realm was rapidly rising!

At this moment, Chi Feng was only a rank one Inner Strength Grandmaster. After swallowing three pieces of the Enlightenment Tea, Chi Feng had actually advanced to the rank eight Inner Strength Grandmaster realm! He had even surpassed Gu Taichu!

Chi Feng immediately raised his head and laughed loudly when he felt this power!

“The Enlightenment Tea... is actually such a holy object, hahahaha!” Chi Feng’s eyes were filled with madness!

One had to know that even in the cultivation world, the Enlightenment Tea was a holy object that was rare! Let alone in the mortal world!

Chi Feng’s lips curled into a sneer as he muttered in a low voice, “Hehehe... Gu Taichu, thank you...”

...

In Chuzhou’s provincial capital, Qin Yu sat cross-legged on the ground as he quietly felt the flow of internal qi.

Although Qin Yu believed that he wouldn’t be able to find an opponent of the same level, he didn’t dare to underestimate Gu Taichu.

Time flew by. In the blink of an eye, the day of their battle had arrived.

On this morning, Gu Taichu suddenly appeared at Qin Yu’s house.

Qin Yu sat cross-legged on the ground with his eyes closed.

“Master Gu, you’re here,” Qin Yu said in a low voice the moment Gu Taichu appeared.

Gu Taichu put his hands behind his back and said with some admiration, “As expected of his descendant. Your perception is very keen.”

Qin Yu’s brows immediately furrowed tightly.

He stood up and looked at Gu Taichu as he said coldly, “You’ve always said that I’m his descendant. Who exactly is the ‘he’ that you’re talking about?”
