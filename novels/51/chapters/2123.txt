2124 Si Liuhe versus Dean Lei

In an instant, everyone in Thunder Courtyard was startled by this sound.

They walked out of the closed door and looked up at the man standing in the void outside Thunder Courtyard.

“Si Liuhe, it’s Si Liuhe!” someone recognized Si Liuhe’s identity and exclaimed.

Everyone in Thunder Courtyard knew that Si Liuhe would definitely come. Thus they were a little worried at this moment.

“Si Liuhe is paying respect to the dean of Thunder Courtyard!” Si Liuhe’s voice rang out again!

At this moment, a phantom appeared in front of Si Liuhe.

This person was none other than Dean Lei.

He put his hands behind his back and said indifferently, “Since you’re here, please come in.”

Si Liuhe, on the other hand, displayed the expected level of respect. He bowed slightly to Dean Lei, then flashed and appeared in front of Dean Lei’s real body.

At this moment, Dean Lei was drinking tea. He looked indifferent. Beside him was a chess game he had yet to finish playing with Qin Yu.

Si Liuhe glanced around and quickly focused his gaze on the chessboard.

Immediately after, Si Liuhe walked straight to the chessboard and sat down.

He stared at the chessboard, and traces of the dao technique arose accordingly!

In just a few seconds, Si Liuhe had deduced the game.

“To be able to match up to Dean Lei, it seems that this person is not simple,” Si Liuhe said.

“Do you want to try?” Dean Lei asked indifferently.

“That’s exactly what I’m thinking!” Si Liuhe’s eyes shone brightly, full of battle intent!

After that, the two began the chess game that had yet to end.

“Dean Lei, I have heard of your deeds, so I respect you very much,” Si Liuhe said while playing chess.

“If I could, I would never want to be your enemy. However, the Traceless Immortal Scripture is tremendously important to my Si Family, so I have no choice.”

This statement might seem polite, but it had a strong sense of threat in reality.

Dean Lei said while playing chess,” Si Liuhe, as a True Saint, do you think it’s appropriate for you to make things difficult for a junior?”

“Make things difficult?” Si Liuhe shook his head. “If I wanted to make things difficult for him, he would have died long ago. Now, I’m only here for the Traceless Immortal Scripture. As long as he hands over the Traceless Immortal Scripture, my Si Family will never have anything to do with him again.”

“Qin Yu obtained that Traceless Immortal Scripture with his own abilities. On what ground do you ask for it?” Dean Lei shook his head and said.

“This world has always respected strength. He, Qin Yu, can’t keep the Traceless Immortal Scripture, and he’s also not qualified to obtain such a holy item,” Si Liuhe said indifferently.

“Qin Yu is in Thunder Courtyard right now. You can’t take him away.”

Upon hearing this, Si Liuhe’s expression turned cold.

He held the chess piece in one hand and said coldly, “In that case, Dean Lei is determined to protect him?”

“What if I say yes?” Dean Lei’s tone was full of dominance.

“Then I can only offend you!” Si Liuhe said coldly.

With that, he picked up the chess piece and slowly placed it on the chessboard.

The chess piece looked ordinary, but it was actually the condensation of a dao technique!

A wave of killing intent rushed toward Dean Lei. In the void, as the chess piece landed, another wave of cold killing intent rushed toward Dean Lei!

Dean Lei held the chess piece in one hand and responded, “Young people shouldn’t be too arrogant!”

With that, Dean Lei’s chess piece suddenly landed! In an instant, Dean Lei’s dao technique also gathered in the void and charged toward Si Liuhe!

It seemed like an ordinary chess game, but in reality, they were using the game to test each other’s strength!

The void surged continuously, and the deafening booming sound filled the air!

The power of the dao technique condensed in the chess piece in Dean Lei’s hand instantly turned into a powerful air current that rushed toward the chessboard like a torrential river. The chessboard surged like a tidal wave instantly. Every piece seemed to have gained life, interweaving into an enormous network.

Si Liuhe’s pupils slightly contracted. He stared at the chessboard that was full of life. The chess pieces in his hands trembled slightly as if they had sensed the formidable pressure of the dao technique in front of them. He frowned and placed the chess piece on the board lightly.

As the chess piece landed, it was like a sharp sword piercing through the oppressive air current. The chessboard instantly fell silent. The fierce force made the chess pieces on the chessboard fall into silence like a field of wheat that had been hit by frost.

Dean Lei slightly narrowed his eyes and looked at Si Liuhe calmly. The chess piece in his hand seemed to contain a mysterious power as it landed on the chessboard again.

This time, Dean Lei did not immediately unleash his dao technique. He just made a simple move. However, this move was like a bomb that had detonated. The silence in the chessboard was instantly broken, and the power like frost hitting the wheat field dissipated instantly.

Si Liuhe was shocked. This sudden change caught him off guard. He looked at the chessboard in front of him, and a hint of shock flashed in his eyes. He knew very well that he was facing an opponent with unfathomable strength.

“Dean Lei really lives up to his reputation.” Si Liuhe raised his head and looked at Dean Lei.

“You’re not bad either,” Dean Lei said calmly. “You’re already so terrifying when you’ve just become a Saint. Your future is boundless.”

He slowly raised the chess piece, a hint of determination flashing in his eyes. He knew that he could not hold back this time. He had to go all out.

The moment the chess piece in his hand landed, the power of the dao technique burst out from the chess piece like a gigantic dragon, instantly breaking the silence and pointing toward the chess game on the chessboard.

This time, he was not as conservative as before. Instead, he directly displayed his most powerful dao technique. That soaring aura instantly tensed up the atmosphere of the entire chessboard.

The chess game was like the calm before the storm. As his chess piece landed, a powerful force tore through the air like lightning. The impact was like a thunderstorm, moving the chess pieces on the chessboard one by one, turning the life-like internal qi into mighty dao technique power.

Dean Lei looked at Si Liuhe with a deep gaze, a hint of admiration in his eyes. Seeing the changes in the chess game, he was surprised by Si Liuhe’s chess skills. The chess piece in his hand landed gently on the chessboard like a bird.

This move was like a flood breaking through a dam. Si Liuhe’s powerful aura was instantly broken down. The power of the dao technique was cut open by an invisible knife, and the chessboard returned to its calm state.

Si Liuhe frowned, and the game ended.

Dean Lei managed to defeat Si Liuhe with a slight advantage.

Si Liuhe’s expression was extremely unnatural. He frowned and looked at Dean Lei with confusion. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“Let’s have some tea.” Dean Lei stood up and sat down at the tea table.

Si Liuhe did not say anything. He narrowed his eyes and looked at Dean Lei’s back. No one knew what he was thinking.
