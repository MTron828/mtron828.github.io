Chapter 2751: The Primal Chaos Flame

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

“Fatty Situ might be the wealthiest family in the entire Saint Kingdom. His family roams the three realms and has businesses all over the three realms. Even the Holy Lord has to respect him. There were countless top-grade magical artifacts in his family. Every time a war breaks out, the Situ family will be the target of everyone’s flattery. Even the Lord of the Saint Kingdom has to seek their help.”

Someone recognized Fatty Situ and immediately introduced him to his companions.

At this moment, Fatty was still shouting with all his might. The top-notch Dharma Treasures and aptitudes on him were indeed drooling.

“Fatty, I want the Hundred Tribulations Heavenly Blade in your hand.”

A man with a dark expression suddenly said.

“This blade? Then what do you have in exchange?”

Fatty asked in a muffled voice.

“Of course, I’ll exchange it with your life.”

“Whoosh!”

Before he could finish his sentence, his head instantly flew up.

After his head rolled on the ground a few times, blood spurted out.

The man was at Dao Realm level 9 but he didn’t even use his peak power before he was killed in one strike.

One of the people beside Fatty had already sheathed his sword.

Even Qin Yu’s Nine Heavens Manifestations Gaze could only catch a shadow of that movement.

“What a fast speed!”

Qin Yu’s face was filled with shock.

“Idiot! You don’t even know Fatty’s Dao Protector before you rob.” Luo Yu sneered.

Qin Yu was speechless when he heard that. Nine Dao Guardians? Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

He must be here to experience life in the land of Heavenly Sin.

However, the Dharma Treasure on Fatty still attracted many people’s attention.

Soon, many people gathered around Fatty.

The sounds of bargaining suddenly rose and fell and it became quite noisy.

“Big brother, do you want this talisman magical artifact?”

Fatty squeezed out of the crowd and came to Xiao Hai’s side.

“I don’t have money, nor do I have any valuable magical artifact.”

Xiao Hai smiled and shook his head.

“I see. It’s free. You can take whichever you like. Please see if you can spare some time to help me if I’m in danger in the following scene. Don’t let me encounter any danger.”

Fatty took out a pile of talismans and was about to stuff them into Xiao Hails hands.

Qin Yu was speechless. Why would he come to the Tomb of Heavenly Sins if he was so afraid of death?

“Then I want the Spacetime Hall in your hands. If you can give it to me, I will do my best to ensure your survival.’

“This is not a good thing. Young hero, are you sure you want this? It can increase your time by ten times. In other words, as long as it’s on you, your mind, speed, and even movements will be ten times faster. However, this can’t be done by external forces. Once you start a battle, its power will be destroyed.

In other words, it can’t be used in battle. It can only be used for cultivation. This thing is a little useless.”

Fatty scratched his head.

“Furthermore, it has a fatal flaw. When using the power of time, you will inevitably suffer a backlash. Once you use the Spacetime Hall, your lifespan will also be consumed by fifty times. In other words, you will have fifty times the amount of time, but you will consume a hundred times the amount of life.”

“It’s fine. What I lack is time. What I don’t lack the most is lifespan.”

Xiao Hai chuckled. He seemed to have recognized this magical artifact long ago.

At this moment, his heart was filled with endless confusion.

He forcefully crossed the four seas in Nanzhou and North Plain to guard Nanzhou’s people. He even endured the pain to delay the awakening of the Lord of North Plain.

However, his soul had already returned to the ghost realm after he had saved Qin Yu.

He wouldn’t know where to go if he hadn’t come to the Saint Kingdom and gained some interest in this place.

Even if he were to face extreme danger here, he was calm and fearless.

He only wanted to understand the origin of this world. Only then would he be interested.

He would not even think about the consumption of 50 times the time.

How could a person whose heart had already died be afraid of the consumption of his life?

“Young hero, this toy is yours then. Don’t you want the rest?”

Fatty placed the Spacetime Hall in Xiao Hails hand.

“No, thank you.”

Xiao Hai nodded.

“Eh, why are you so weak? Dao Realm level 9. You haven’t cultivated peak power but you have the Soul Suppression Ring to protect you. You also have a powerful weapon but I can’t see it. The grade of the weapon is very high.”

Fatty took out a magnifying glass and looked at Qin Yu at the side. He immediately asked curiously.

“F*ck! You can even see this!”

Qin Yu immediately felt a chill run down his spine.

Fortunately, this fatty only whispered to him.

Otherwise, his days would not be easy even if he went out successfully if the news of the Soul Suppression Ring got out.

“I’ll give you this thing. Your strength is still too weak here. This thing can increase your chances of protecting yourself.”

Fatty threw a small rag doll over.

“Is this a death substitute made from the primordial mother gold of the Divine Realm?”

Cang Yunzi cried out in shock, his beard almost breaking.

“F*ck!

When Qin Yu heard this, he quickly put away the rag doll. From Cang Yunzi’s reaction, this should be something good.

“Eh, you old fellow know this stuff! Do you have anything good for us to exchange?”

Fatty was a little surprised.

“Sigh! How could an old man like me have anything that interests you?” Cang Yunzi shook his head and smiled bitterly.

Qin Yu suddenly understood why the Situ family was the wealthiest in the Saint Kingdom.

This kind of behavior of sprinkling gold looked like an upstart.

However, Qin Yu realized that whether it was Xiao Hai or the other people he had chosen, they were all experts with unfathomable depths.

He also had many secrets on him.

This was especially true for Sir Dagger who could instantly kill a third-grade Heavenly Sin.

However, this fatty noticed that this kind of extravagant method would at least give people a good impression of the Situ family.

“Hurry up! Don’t miss it! It’s a level 14 peak power talisman! There was also this magical artifact, the Nirvana Purple Flame Fan, which could summon purple flames with a single fan! And the Primal Chaos Flame is a supreme-grade item. It’s the first divine flame that appeared after the creation of the world in the Primordial Era. It could be used not only to attack but also to temper the body! I stole it when my dad wasn’t paying attention! Brothers, come over and touch it, but I’m not responsible for burning you to death!” Fatty was like a peddler in the market as he shouted again.

Qin Yu’s mouth twitched a few times. He immediately retracted his previous analysis.

This da*n fatty might be throwing them around casually. He didn’t know where he had gathered such a terrifying collection of magical artifacts. Any one of these would probably cause a sensation even in the Dao Mystical Saint Kingdom.

“Primal Chaos Flame. Not bad.”

A voice rang out in Qin Yu’s sea of consciousness. It was none other than Dagger, who had been sleeping for a long time.

Since Sir Dagger said this, this divine flame must be good!
