Chapter 1336: Chapter 1,336

Qin Yu had killed Ling Yun in front of the Great Elder.

This was not only a loss for the Heavenly Cloud Sect, but it was also a humiliation for them.

As the true overlord of the Southern Province, they had never suffered such humiliation!

The shadow slowly disappeared, but no one dared to approach it.

Everyone was afraid of getting involved with Qin Yu and inviting revenge from the Heavenly Cloud sect.

Everyone knew that from today onwards, Qin Yu’s name would not only be famous in the southern province, but he would also be blacklisted by the Heavenly Cloud sect.

“I’m afraid that this child will not be able to move forward in the future,”someone thought to himself.

They retreated slowly and did not dare to stay any longer.

A moment later, wan ‘er, who had regained her senses, walked over quickly.

“Young Master Qin, are you... Are You Hurt?”Wan ‘er asked tentatively.

Qin Yu shook his head and replied, “No.”

This battle was much easier than expected. No one had expected that Ling Yun would be killed so easily.

As the number one genius of the southern province, he had died in such an aggrieved manner.

He had prepared countless spells but was killed by two punches before he even had the chance to make a move.

Let alone being famous in the Holy Region, he would probably be nailed to the pillar of shame if he were to compete with the elites of the world.

“Miss Wan ‘er, stay away from me. Otherwise, it will be easy to get angry,”Qin Yu said.

Wan ‘er smiled and said, “I don’t care. Anyway, I plan to leave the South Province.”

“Leave the Tianyun sect? Then where are you going?”Qin Yu said in surprise.

Wan ‘er said, “I haven’t thought about it yet. I will most likely choose the Thunder Courtyard.”

“Thunder Courtyard...”Qin Yu murmured in a low voice.

He knew this place. It was not in the center of the Li Prefecture, but in the southeast corner.

This was also the most unique place in the entire Li Prefecture. It was clearly an academy, but it occupied the entire prefecture’s position.

“Young Master Qin, why don’t you go to the Thunder Academy with me? As long as you go to the Thunder Academy, the Heavenly Cloud sect can’t do anything to you,”Wan ‘er suggested.

Qin Yu was silent for a moment. The Thunder Academy was indeed a good place to go.

The only pity was that Qin Yu didn’t have any spiritual energy in his body at the moment, so the Thunder Academy might not accept him.

Wan ‘er seemed to have seen through Qin Yu’s thoughts. She smiled and said, “Young Master Qin, you killed Ling Yun. This is a way to get in. As for the problem with your spiritual energy, it’s just because you were poisoned by the Twilight Qi. It’s not like it can’t be cured.”

Qin Yu sighed and said, “My symptoms are a little strange. The Thunder Academy won’t believe it.”

If it wasn’t for the special nature of the symptoms, they wouldn’t have offended the heavenly cloud sect.

“Alright.”Wan ‘Er didn’t say anything else when she saw this.

“Young Master Qin, I’m a little curious. You clearly won against Ling Yun. Why do you have to kill him?”Wan ‘er asked with some doubt.

Qin Yu said coldly, “Because he deserves to die. He killed my friend, so I must have him buried with me! If there’s a chance, I want the entire Tianyun sect to be buried with me!”

Wan ‘er was only a little surprised when she heard this, but she didn’t say anything else.

This matter quickly spread throughout the entire southern province.

The news spread like wings.

While everyone was amazed by Qin Yu’s abilities, they couldn’t help but tease Ling Yun.

“The number one genius of the southern province was killed by two punches and didn’t even fight back. What a joke.”

“Haha, I Get Angry When I see Ling Yun’s appearance. He’s young but has such a vicious personality. I knew he wouldn’t end well!”

“Serves him right! He must have met a tough opponent this time, right? A bare-footed person isn’t afraid of wearing shoes!”

The Tianyun sect’s reputation had been completely destroyed. The entire sect was shrouded in a strange atmosphere.

In a certain training room in the Tianyun sect.

Di Zun was feeling proud in his heart. Even his face couldn’t help but reveal a smile.

“As expected of my master. He actually killed Ling Yun with two punches!”Di Zun muttered softly.

He wished that he could tell everyone about his relationship with Qin Yu. However, this was the Tianyun sect after all. He didn’t dare to say anything.

This feeling of wanting to say something but being unable to do so was too unbearable.

At this moment, elder Bai walked in from outside.

Seeing elder Bai, Di Zun hurriedly stood up and said, “Greetings, master.”

Elder Bai nodded slightly. He said faintly, “You should have heard the news of Ling Yun’s death, right?”

Di zun replied graciously, “It’s hard not to hear it. Sigh, this is really a sad news.”

Although he said that, he was overjoyed in his heart. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Elder Bai nodded slightly and snorted coldly. “I didn’t Expect Qin Yu to be so bold as to kill Ling Yun in front of the first elder!”

“Awesome!”Di Zun couldn’t help but blurt out.

“What did you say?”Elder Bai frowned.

Di Zun quickly changed his words. “I said... how arrogant!”

Elder bai snorted and continued, “This isn’t bad news for us. Once he dies, you can take over.”

Di Zun waved his hand. “I don’t dare.”

“There’s nothing to be afraid of,”elder Bai said with a smile.

“If you take over, I can also bask in your glory.”

As he spoke, a disciple suddenly walked in from outside.

“Elder Bai, the sect master has invited you to the Assembly Hall for a meeting.”The disciple bowed and said.

Elder Bai stroked his beard and said, “Alright, I understand. You can go.”

After the disciple left, elder Bai glanced at di zun and smiled, “The opportunity has come.”
