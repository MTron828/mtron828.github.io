After saying that, Sun Bo rolled up his sleeves and walked towards Qin Yu.

“Sigh, Sun Bo, forget it. If you hit a waiter, won’t that embarrass yourself?” Zhang Hang said with a smile.

After saying that, he even patted Qin Yu’s shoulder hypocritically and said, “Qin Yu, we are all classmates, so why do we have to be so tense? Quick, bow to Sun Bo and apologize, then this matter will be over.”

“Yes, I won’t let you kneel. Just bow to me and this matter will be over.” Sun Bo said proudly.

Qin Yu sneered and said, “Bow to you? Are you worthy? I’m not a petty person. I have long forgotten about what happened in the past.”

“But if you insist on being petty, I don’t mind teaching you a lesson.”

When Sun Bo heard that, he immediately laughed out loud.

“Did you hear that? He wants to teach me a lesson!” Sun Bo held his stomach and laughed out loud.

After that, Sun Bo leaned his head over and said, “How do you want to teach me a lesson?”

Qin Yu opened his mouth and was about to speak when Sun Bo suddenly said angrily, “You f * cking forgot how it felt to take a beating!”

As he spoke, Sun Bo tried to slap Qin Yu!

However, the expected slap didn’t land on Qin Yu’s face even after a long time.

On the contrary, Sun Bo’s wrist was easily grabbed by Qin Yu, and he couldn’t move.

“Sun Bo, does using your history of bullying as a post-meal topic give you a sense of honor?” Qin Yu grabbed Sun Bo’s wrist and said coldly.

Sun Bo struggled desperately, but he found that he couldn’t break free!

He said with some panic, “Let go of my hand!”

However, Qin Yu looked at Sun Bo coldly and continued, “How many students have you humiliated in public? Do you know what kind of harm this will do to others? How many years will they be ridiculed by others?”

“F * ck, let go of me!” How could Sun Bo listen to him? He glared at Qin Yu vehemently.

Qin Yu said coldly, “If I don’t teach a person like you a lesson, you will never know how to respect others.”

After saying that, Qin Yu kicked Sun Bo’s knee.

With a crisp cracking sound, Sun Bo’s knee cracked and he knelt on the ground!

His wails spread throughout the entire room!

The other people in the room had ugly expressions on their faces. They had never expected Qin Yu to be so ruthless!

“There are some injuries where if we don’t take revenge, it will become a permanent source of trauma in our hearts,” Qin Yu said coldly.

“Sun Bo, just kneel here and atone for your sins.”

Sun Bo tried to struggle, but he found that he couldn’t stand up at all! ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

His shoulders felt like two huge mountains were pressing down, and his entire body was extremely heavy.

“Qin... Qin Yu, forget it. We’re all classmates...” Zhang Hang, who was beside him, advised.

“You like to pretend to be a good person, right? Kneel down too.” After saying that, Qin Yu waved his hand, and a huge force pressed down on Zhang Hang’s body!

With a bang, Zhang Hang kneeled on the ground.

The expressions of the people in the private room were somewhat unsightly, and they felt flustered.

“Qin Yu, are you crazy!? I’m telling you, I won’t spare you!” Sun Bo said through gritted teeth.

He took out his cell phone and made a call.

After the call was picked up, Sun Bo shouted, “Buddy, I was bullied at the No.1 Restaurant. Hurry up and save me!”

Sun Bo also said in a sinister tone, “Just you wait. When my buddy comes, he won’t let you off!”

“That’s right! Our boss is the young master of Xiang Real Estate! He has a lot of thugs under him! Just you wait!”

“The young master of Xiang Real Estate? Xiang Zhuang?” Qin Yu raised his eyebrows and asked.

Sun Bo sneered.”Since you know my boss’s name, you should know how powerful he is!”

Qin Yu said indifferently, “I really don’t know how powerful he is. I only know that when he sees me, he will respectfully call me Mr. Qin.”

“Oh, right. I came to this restaurant today because he invited me to eat.”

“Hahaha! You keep bragging! Our boss treated you to a meal? Who do you think you’re?!” Sun Bo gnashed his teeth and said.

“If you have the guts, then don’t leave. When my buddy comes, I’ll see what you can do!”

Qin Yu nodded and said, “I’ll wait for him.”

Time flew by, and in the blink of an eye, ten minutes had passed.

Soon, the door of the private room was opened.

Then, a large group of people swarmed in!

The leader was a man with golden chains who looked somewhat similar to Lei Hu.

These people were the thugs under the Xiang Corporation.

As soon as he saw the man with the golden chains, Sun Bo put on a fawning look.

“Buddy, you’re finally here!” Sun Bo shouted anxiously.

He pointed at Qin Yu and cursed, “Buddy, this kid broke my knee. You must avenge me!”

The people in the private room also added fuel to the fire, “Yes! This kid not only beat Mr. Sun, but also insulted Mr. Xiang! You must not let him off!”

When the man with the golden chains heard this, he immediately said with a cold expression, “Dude, you have quite the guts. What’s the matter? Are you a rich heir?”

It was very obvious that the man with the golden chains was trying to negotiate.

After all, this was Jingdu. The slightest carelessness could result in one provoking a big shot with a powerful background.

Sun Bo also discerned the intention of the man with the golden chains and hurriedly said, “Buddy, you don’t have to worry. This kid is my classmate, a loser from Jiangcheng who works here as a waiter!”

Hearing this, the man with the golden chains immediately felt relieved.

He sized up Qin Yu and said, “Dude, you hit my buddy. What do you think we should do?”

Qin Yu glanced at him and sneered.”He deserved it. Let your boss talk to me.”

“Let our boss talk to you? I think you’re courting death!” The man with the golden chains suddenly flew into a rage!

He waved his hand and shouted, “Buddies, go kill him!”

Everyone held their clubs and walked towards Qin Yu.

Just when everyone was ready to make a move, Xiang Zhuang suddenly walked in from outside the door.

“All of you, stop!” Xiang Zhuang shouted.

Everyone was stunned when they saw Xiang Zhuang.

Sun Bo said anxiously, “Sir, you’re here! This kid insulted our company and even hit me!”

The man with the golden chains also quickly nodded and said, “Mr. Xiang, this kid doesn’t know his place. I was just about to teach him a lesson.”

“I think you’re the one who doesn’t know your place!” Xiang Zhuang said angrily.

The man with the golden chains was stunned. He said awkwardly, “Mr. Xiang, what do you mean by this?”

Xiang Zhuang ignored the man with the golden chains. He hurried to Qin Yu and said apologetically, “Mr. Qin, are you okay?”
