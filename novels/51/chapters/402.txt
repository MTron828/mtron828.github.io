Chapter 403: Who On Earth Are You? ! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

“Qin Yu? Are you scared silly by Qin Yu?” The person beside him couldn’t help but mock.

“That’s right. Would Qin Yu dare to come here? Wouldn’t he be digging his own grave?”

Jing Shihong frowned.

He scratched his ears, and a trace of doubt flashed in his eyes.

Just now... He clearly heard someone call out Qin Yu’s name.

“Alright, stop talking nonsense. The treasure is about to be born!” Yan Haoran’s eyes were filled with eagerness.

He stared at the huge pit while waiting for the treasure to be born.

Below, Qin Yu’s body was being reconstructed bit by bit. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Countless rays of light wrapped around his body while outlining his entire being, as if a God had descended from the heavens!

Qin Yu’s skin was somewhat translucent, and even his pores were so small that they couldn’t be seen clearly with the naked eye!

At a glance, Qin Yu had transformed from a 30-year-old rough man into a 20-year-old young man!

His transcendent aura caused Xiao Yu, who wasn’t far away, to feel dumbstruck and awestruck!

Was the man in front of her still that 30-year-old man?

Qin Yu didn’t show any emotion on his face.

He stood there with his upper body naked. No one knew what he was thinking.

“Is this the power of an Inner Strength Grandmaster?” After a while, Qin Yu lowered his head and looked at his body.

His entire body turned into a dark golden color at this moment, as if he was wearing a layer of armor.

The power in his body increased by a hundred folds!

Although there was only a slight difference in realm, the difference in strength was astonishing!

“I’ve finally stepped into the Inner Strength Grandmaster realm.” Qin Yu exhaled a mouthful of internal qi.

He turned his head to look at Xiao Yu and said, “Give me your mask.”

Xiao Yu, who was in a daze, came back to her senses.

She hurriedly handed the mask to Qin Yu and then carefully retreated.

Seeing this, Qin Yu couldn’t help but laugh. “What are you doing?”

Xiao Yu whispered, “I. . . I don’t know either.”

Qin Yu patted Xiao Yu’s head and said, “I’ll return this mask to you later, in case the people upstairs snatch it away.”

Xiao Yu nodded repeatedly.

“Let’s go. We should go up,” Qin Yu said as he looked up at the top of the huge pit.

“Okay.” Xiao Yu didn’t say anything.

She obediently walked to Qin Yu’s side.

Just as the two of them were about to go up, Jing Shihong shouted, “Are you dead? Have you found the treasure?”

Qin Yu couldn’t help but smile coldly.

“Just you wait. I’ll go up and give you the treasure,” Qin Yu said indifferently.

Then, Qin Yu looked at Xiao Yu and said, “Hold me tight.”

“Okay.” Xiao Yu quickly nodded. She reached out and hugged Qin Yu’s waist, then closed her eyes.

Qin Yu jumped toward the top of the huge pit!

His body was surrounded by a ray of light. Looking at the bottom from the top, it was almost impossible to see his figure.

“The treasure is coming out!” Seeing this ray of light, Yan Haoran said excitedly.

The others hurriedly surrounded him to see the scene of the treasure coming out!

“Swoosh!”

A figure flew out of the huge pit like a cannonball!

Then, the light landed in front of everyone.

He still wore a hat on his head and Xiao Yu on his back.

Jing Shihong glared at Qin Yu and said, “Where’s the treasure? Hurry up and take it out!”

Qin Yu ignored Jing Shihong and looked at Yan Haoran.

“Young Master Yan, I’ve brought the item for you. Don’t you have to fulfill your promise?” Qin Yu said with a nonchalant smile.

Yan Haoran said with a bit of urgency, “Stop talking nonsense and take out the treasure for me!”

Qin Yu sneered. “You haven’t fulfilled your promise yet.”

“Fulfill my promise?” Yan Haoran revealed his true colors.

“You’re only an Inner Strength Past Master. Yet you want to be the boss?” Yan Haoran said coldly.

Qin Yu raised his eyebrows and said, “So, you are planning to break the promise?”

“Hehe, you have to give it now even if you don’t want to.” Yan Haoran sneered.

“Of course, if you give it to me obediently, I might be able to give you a chance to serve the Yan family.”

Jing Shihong scolded from the side, “Hurry up and thank Young Master Yan! To be able to serve the Yan family is your honor!”

Qin Yu sneered. “Being a lapdog for an aristocratic family is your lifelong wish, right? I have to be grateful to be a slave for them? Wouldn’t I be out of my mind?”

As soon as he said this, everyone was shocked!

Yan Haoran’s expression turned even colder.

“What do you mean?” A terrifying internal qi burst out from Yan Haoran’s body.

Qin Yu said indifferently, “Nothing.”

“Do you want to give me the thing or not?” Yan Haoran asked impatiently.

“Yes, of course I want to give it to you. It’s in my hands. Come and take it,” Qin Yu said indifferently.

Yan Haoran snorted lightly and immediately strode toward Qin Yu.

However, Jing Shihong asked anxiously, “Young Master Yan, can I deal with that woman?”

Yan Haoran frowned and said impatiently, “Do whatever you want.”

“Thank you, Young Master Yan!” Jing Shihong was overjoyed and immediately walked toward Xiao Yu.

Yan Haoran walked in front of Qin Yu eagerly.

“Where is it?” Yan Haoran asked.

Qin Yu stretched out his hand and said, “It’s right here.”

Yan Haoran hurriedly looked at Qin Yu’s palm.

At this moment, Qin Yu suddenly stretched out his hand and grabbed Yan Haoran’s neck!

A terrifying force came at this moment!

Yan Haoran’s expression changed greatly. He used all his energy to break free, but he found that Qin Yu’s palm was like an iron pincer. No matter how hard he struggled, he couldn’t break free!

The sudden change made everyone’s expression change!

“Are you crazy?!” Bi Guocang took the lead and shouted.

Qin Yu ignored him. He glanced at everyone and said indifferently, “I don’t know why, but I have a special feeling when facing you guys.”

“It’s like... I can crush you guys with my bare hands,” Qin Yu sighed.

Jing Shihong berated, “I think you’re crazy! Do you want to die? Let go of Young Master Yan!”

Qin Yu looked at Jing Shihong coldly and said, “Jing Shihong, I have a friend who asked me to kill you. She’s a person with a good temper, but when she mentioned you, she looked angry.”

“Her name is Fang Yue. Can you tell me what you did to her?” Qin Yu asked.

“Fang Yue?” Jing Shihong froze, then he laughed out loud and said, “That sl*t? D*mn, I forgot about her. I actually let her run away last time! What a pity!”

Qin Yu’s expression became even colder.

“Jing Shihong, don’t you know that lust can get you killed?” Qin Yu said coldly.

At this moment, everyone also felt that something was wrong.

“Fang Yue’s friend? Who exactly are you?” Bi Guocang asked coldly.

Qin Yu glanced at him and sneered. “Weren’t you looking for me?”

As he spoke, Qin Yu slowly took off the hat on his head to reveal his true face.
