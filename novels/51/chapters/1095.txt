Chapter 1096: Chapter 10096, Summon the Demon Beast 

Soon, a group of people appeared on the deck of the opposite ship.

They were playing with pistols in their hands, looking quite stunning.

“Hand over all the valuable things on the ship, and maybe we can consider leaving you with a whole corpse,”the leader, Scarface, said coldly. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Gong Tianyu shook the wine glass in his hand and said indifferently, “Let me give you a piece of advice. Don’t give yourself trouble.”

Scarface’s face turned cold when he heard that.

He took out his pistol and pointed it at Gong Tianyu.

Before Gong Tianyu could say anything, Scarface pulled the trigger!

“Bang!”

The bullet flew toward Gong Tianyu!

At this moment, the bodyguard beside him quickly blocked in front of Gong Tianyu. Then, he reached out and caught the bullet in his hand!

Seeing this scene, Gong Tianyu couldn’t help but clap his hands. He clapped and said, “Not bad, not bad. How is it? You all saw it, right? You can even catch a bullet! What’s there to be afraid of?”

Chang Mang and the others sneered and looked like they were watching a good show.

Scarface, who was opposite them, saw the situation and immediately frowned.

“If you know what’s good for you, then get lost quickly. Otherwise, don’t blame me for being impolite!”Gong Tianyu shouted.

Scarface did not say a word. He turned around and returned to the ship. In just a moment, an old man who looked like he was in his 60s walked out.

This old man was their leader. He was also a genuine martial saint!

“Where did you find another Old Thing?”Gong Tianyu did not realize the danger at all.

That old man had his hands behind his back. His feet trembled slightly and he immediately landed on the deck.

Gong Tianyu glared at the old man and said, “Old Man, who told you to get on the ship? Get off the ship!”

The old man glanced at gong tianyu and said, “Kid, you’d better be polite when talking to me.”

“Polite? I think you’re courting death! Get on the ship and throw him into the sea!”Gong Tianyu cursed.

After saying that, the bodyguard beside him rubbed his fists and walked forward.

“Idiot.”Chang Mang, who was beside him, couldn’t help but Snort coldly.

The bodyguard rubbed his fists and then strode toward the old man.

“Old Man, our boss said that you...”

“Bang!”

Before the bodyguard could finish his words, the old man raised his hand slightly.

In almost an instant, the bodyguard’s body exploded!

Pieces of flesh and blood flew wantonly, and fresh blood splashed on Gong Tianyu’s face!

Gong Tianyu was stunned on the spot.

The pungent smell of blood made his whole body tremble!

“Who’s in charge of this ship?”The old man swept his hands behind his back and looked at everyone.

“Him!”Chang Mang immediately pointed at Gong Tianyu.

Gong Tianyu’s expression changed drastically. He swallowed his saliva as if he wanted to say something, but Chang Mang and the others didn’t give him a chance at all and turned around to leave.

“Don’t... Don’t go!”Gong Tianyu hurriedly shouted.

Chang mang sneered, “Didn’t you look down on us? Settle it yourself.”

After saying this, Chang Mang turned around and left.

Zhuang Teng and the others did not stay any longer. They followed behind Chang Mang and turned around to walk towards the basement.

Gong Tianyu was so scared that his crotch was stained with a fishy yellow. His lips trembled as he said in a trembling voice, “Don’t... Don’t go. Save me. I know I’m wrong... Zhuang Teng, save me...”

However, no one paid any attention to Gong Tianyu.

Gong Tianyu was extremely frightened. He knelt on the ground with a “Plop”and said with a trembling voice, “Don’t... Don’t kill me. I’ll give you all the money I have on me. I’ll also give you this boat...”

After saying that, Gong Tianyu took out his bank card and all the valuables on him from his pocket and handed them to the old man.

The old man didn’t stand on ceremony. He put all the valuables into his pocket and then glanced at the other merchants.

“I told you not to come, but you didn’t listen! It’s all your fault!”The merchants beside him took out the money and scolded him.

Even though that was the case, no one could do anything now.

“We’ve given you all the valuables on us. You... Can You Leave Now?”Gong Tianyu asked with a trembling voice.

The old man shook his head and said indifferently, “No one has ever been able to leave my hands alive. This ship, just disappear.”

After he finished speaking, the old man’s hand flashed with a bright light and a terrifying internal Qi instantly gathered in his palm.

Gong Tianyu’s face instantly turned ashen. He knelt on the ground and shouted desperately, “Don’t Kill Us, I beg you...”

However, this old man was a martial saint. In his eyes, Gong Tianyu and the others were like ants, not worth mentioning at all.

The light in his hand grew brighter and brighter as a terrifying qi energy gathered.

“Disappear.”The old man said indifferently as his palm slowly pressed forward.

“Boom!”

The light in his hand rolled towards the ship like a cannonball!

At this moment, a blood-red light flashed past. He waved his hand and sent the light flying!

The light exploded on the surface of the sea. The sea water shook as if it had triggered a tsunami.

“Damn it, if you want to kill him, then kill him. What the hell are you doing destroying the ship? Are You Cheap?”Chang Mang cursed.

The old man frowned slightly and said in a deep voice, “Martial saint? Who Are You?”

“I am your father!”Chang Mang did not waste any words and charged at the old man with his fist clenched!

The Old Man’s face changed. He did not dare to be negligent and hurriedly raised his hand to meet the attack!

“Bang!”

The moment the two sides collided, the entire sea surface instantly exploded dozens of meters!

Yao Meng and the others hurriedly made their moves and activated their genuine Qi to protect the ship.

Under this punch, the old man was directly pushed back dozens of meters and half of his palm exploded!

As a holy body, Chang Mang’s physical strength was naturally self-evident. It was definitely not something that this old man could compare to.

“You actually met a martial saint here.”The old man’s expression was somewhat cold.

Chang Mang looked at this old man coldly and said, “You Burn, kill, and plunder every day. Today, I will execute justice on behalf of the heavens and kill you, you old bastard!”

The old man’s eyes narrowed slightly, as if he could tell that Chang Mang was extraordinary.

At the same time, he looked at Yao Meng and the others who were not far away.

“I’m afraid these people are not ordinary people,”the old man said in a low voice.

However, there was no fear in his eyes. Instead, there was a trace of excitement.

“That’s fine. I’ll kill all of you today!”The old man sneered.

Then, he raised both of his hands and murmured. A strange light emitted from his body.

The light sank into the sea like a silver waterfall. Then, the entire sea started to move!

“Roar!”

At this moment, a huge demonic beast rose from the sea!

The huge body stirred the entire sea and the boat started to shake violently!

“Ah! !”Gong Tianyu and the rest were so scared that they were shouting with panic.

Qin Yu, who was in seclusion, was also awakened by this movement.

He opened his eyes slightly and frowned slightly.

“What movement?”Qin Yu released his divine sense and quickly covered the surroundings.
