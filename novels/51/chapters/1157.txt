Chapter 1158: Chapter 1,158, the Witty Qin Yu 

Yan Yongfu’s expression instantly turned extremely ugly.

Even Qin Yu couldn’t help but frown. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“Su Qi, you!”A trace of anger flashed across Yan Yongfu’s face.

Su Qi sneered, “Do you think I’ll let you live alone? In your dreams!”

“Gu Xinghe, this Qin Yu is thinking of a way to escape. Once he escapes, Yan Yongfu will give Yan Ruoxue’s blood to Qin Yu to increase his strength!”Su Qi looked at Gu Xinghe and said.

“Yes, Su Qi is right. We heard it with our own ears!”The other higher-ups saw that this move was effective and quickly followed up, as if they wanted to take the opportunity to exchange for their own lives.

Gu Xinghe’s expression turned cold. He narrowed his eyes and looked at Qin Yu, saying, “TSK TSK, it’s already like this. Aren’t you being honest?”

Qin Yu did not say a word. He looked calm and collected, but in reality, a storm was raging in his heart!

Gu Xinghe snorted, “Yan Yongfu, do you really have Yan Ruoxue’s blood on You?”

“Where did I get this blood? If I had it, I would have fused with it myself,”Yan Yongfu snorted.

Gu Xinghe sneered, “I will know if you have it or not after I search your body. But let me tell you, if you hand it over now, I can pretend that nothing happened. If I find it, you can consider the consequences yourself!”

With that, Gu Xinghe strode towards Yan Yongfu and started the search.

However, after a round of searching, he found nothing. There was no trace of blood at all.

Gu Xinghe frowned and looked at Su Qi coldly.

Su Qi hurriedly said, “He must have hidden it! It’s not with him!”

At this moment, Qin Yu suddenly had an idea and could not help but smile coldly.

He ridiculed from the side, “Gu Xinghe, I said you’re stupid, but you still don’t admit it.”

Gu Xinghe suddenly looked at Qin Yu and raised his hand to slap Qin Yu’s face.

“Qin Yu, do you not understand the situation? How dare you talk to Me Like That?”Gu Xinghe said with a gloomy face.

Qin Yu continued to ridicule, “Because you are indeed stupid. This Su Qi is obviously lying to you. Can’t you see it?”

Gu Xinghe frowned slightly and asked, “What do you mean?”

Qin Yu said indifferently, “Use your brain to think. This Su Qi claimed that Yan Yongfu has Yan Ruoxue’s blood and said that he hid it. What will happen next?”

Gu Xinghe thought for a moment and said coldly, “I have to let this Yan Yongfu lead the way to find the blood?”

“That’s right!”Qin Yu was overjoyed. This idiot had fallen into his trap!

“This way, Yan Yongfu will have a chance to escape. After all, he is a mighty figure. With time, he will definitely recover to his peak condition.”

“When that time comes, I’m afraid your position will be lost.”

Su Qi, who was at the side, immediately became anxious. She hurriedly explained, “This Qin Yu is lying to you! Don’t believe his words!”

Qin Yu was not anxious either. He slightly closed his eyes and said, “Gu Xinghe, do you think the possibility of Yan Yongfu working with Me is higher, or is the possibility of him working with Su Qi Higher?”

“Don’t forget, the eight of them have been together for hundreds of years.”

Gu Xinghe’s expression completely turned cold. His pair of eyes that were filled with “Wisdom”also looked coldly at Su Qi.

“It’s really not like that! Qin Yu is lying, he’s lying to you!”Su Qi explained in panic.

At this moment, Yan Yongfu sighed and said, “Alright, Su Qi, since we’ve been seen through, there’s no need to continue. There’s no point.”

These words added fuel to the fire and Gu Xinghe’s expression turned extremely cold.

He grabbed Su Qi’s neck, and a terrifying force burst out from his hand!

This force was so strong that it almost broke Su Qi’s neck!

“Even now, you still dare to play me, right?”Gu Xinghe said coldly.

Su Qi opened her mouth, wanting to explain something, but she couldn’t say a word.

“I’m warning you, the current me is not the Gu Xinghe that is at your mercy! If you want to die, I don’t mind sending you on your way ahead of Time!”Gu Xinghe said coldly.

He threw Su Qi to the side and said coldly, “Since you’re still not being honest, then don’t blame me for being rude.”

With that, Gu Xinghe’s hand glowed and pointed at the end of the chain again.

The pain doubled again!

Su Qi, Yan Yongfu, and the others’faces instantly twisted.

Even Qin Yu couldn’t help but frown. It was obvious that the pain had reached his limit.

“I’m warning you, you’d better not play any tricks,”Gu Xinghe said coldly.

“When I’m done, I’ll execute you in public!”

“I want everyone to know the consequences of offending me, Gu Xinghe!”

After saying this, Gu Xinghe turned around and walked out.

The door slowly closed and Qin Yu couldn’t help but heave a sigh of relief.

However, under this intense pain, his mind had almost become numb, and even his thoughts had slowed down a lot.

“Qin Yu... you’re ruthless...”Su Qi said through gritted teeth.

Qin Yu sneered, “Serves you right. With just you, you still want to set me up? Do you have the ability to do that?”

Yan Yongfu couldn’t care less about the pain. He said with some admiration, “As expected... those who do great things... still need to use their brains, even for cultivators...”

Qin Yu ignored Yan Yongfu.

Fortunately, these people didn’t know that Qin Yu was comprehending the fighting formula.

Otherwise, Gu Xinghe might have killed Qin Yu immediately.

“Fortunately, I’m smart,”Qin Yu thought to himself.

He closed his eyes and planned to continue comprehending the fighting formula.

“Qin Yu, do you have any way to escape...”Yan Yongfu asked.

Qin Yu glanced at him and said, “According to this progress, if you give me a few more days, it should be about the same.”

Qin Yu had already figured out the fifth level of the fighting word formula.

It was only a matter of time before he figured it out.
