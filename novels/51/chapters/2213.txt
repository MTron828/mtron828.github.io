2214 Xi Menn’s Sword

The soul-cultivating man sneered and said.

“What a coincidence. My buddy is also in the Skywater Prison, but I’ll personally break the Skywater Prison of the bullsh*t Si family and save him.”

“Hahaha, we’ll talk about it if you can go back. We’ve been exiled here for more than a thousand years. In the beginning, we were as naive as you. Now, we can only kill naive people like you.”

The soul-cultivating man laughed loudly and said.

“Why are you talking so much nonsense with him? Behead him, and maybe the Si family will send us back.”

Ta Shan said loudly.

“Even if my divine soul is damaged, it’s not something you guys can shake,” Qin Yu said.

Qin Yu’s expression turned cold.

The Pure Heart Sutra he had exchanged at Thunder Courtyard back then had already tempered his soul incomparably firm.

Furthermore, although his divine sense was damaged during his battle with Xing Xiu, he gained a lot from his attack.

The attack of the divine sense could also carry the laws of heaven and earth.

A wisp of divine sense directly wiped out the robe Wu Ji had left behind and the supreme treasure of Venerable Fifth Mountain. How terrifying!

A golden light suddenly slashed out. It carried traces of dark light on it.

The power of destruction.

That was the Traceless Annihilation that Qin Yu had previously comprehended. A trace of rules’ force wrapped around the golden saber.

The golden saber sank into the gigantic silver-white figure like a burning red iron saber sinking into ice.

The vengeful spirit in the sea of consciousness collapsed, and the gray-white figure instantly melted.

“Ah!”

The man screamed miserably. This attack severely injured his soul.

At this moment, Qin Yu’s soul dimmed directly.

This attack had practically used up all of the power of his divine soul.

The golden light on his body became increasingly dimmer. His soul was stripped away, and he once again forcefully urged the power of his divine sense regardless of his injuries.

At this moment, the connection between Qin Yu’s soul and body was about to be severed.

“Hurry up and attack!”

The man shrieked.

“Wild Rose Dance.”

A vine suddenly lashed out at Qin Yu’s divine sense figurine.

Qin Yu’s vision turned black, and the golden light on the figurine’s body was almost gone. Like a layer of black cloth slowly pulled in front of him, his divine sense was covered, and heaven and earth were about to be covered.

Then Chang Hu clenched his claws and instantly stabbed into Qin Yu’s skin, wanting to dig out his heart.

“Little brother, don’t blame us. You can only blame yourself for offending the nine great aristocratic families. Moreover, you’re a little naive. How can you trust people so easily in purgatory?”

Wu Mei chuckled coquettishly and said.

“Do you think you can kill me just like that?”

Qin Yu gritted his teeth so hard that they bled.

The Netherworld Meridian Circulation Technique!

A fierce whirlwind suddenly emerged from his dim soul, and a strong suction force surged into the entire spiritual space like a vortex.

The sea of divine sense that flowed on it was sucked into Qin Yu’s figurine like a storm.

“Burp!”

Qin Yu’s divine sense burped. This was the soul of a True Saint.

In less than an instant, it was swallowed by Qin Yu.

The spiritual space suddenly shattered. In the next moment, Qin Yu’s body glowed with golden light.

He grabbed Chang Hu’s neck with one hand, and a terrifying force pressed down on him like Mount Tai, making him unable to lift even a finger.

“Spare my life. The nine great aristocratic families have forced me to do this.”

Chang Hu said with difficulty.

“Since you’ve made your choice, you must bear the consequences.”

Qin Yu said indifferently.

“Crack!”

Chang Hu’s neck was crushed by him directly. Then he stepped up to Ta Shan, who did not even have time to say anything.

He kicked Ta Shan in the head.

“It’s your turn.”

Qin Yu came to Wu Mei expressionlessly and grabbed her rose whip.

“Spare my life. I’ll do anything.”

Wu Mei struggled desperately, revealing the curves of her body.

“Die!”

The vortex suddenly appeared, and Qin Yu instantly absorbed a soul even larger than the soul-cultivating man’s.

Wu Mei’s soul seemed to be much stronger than the soul-cultivating man. Qin Yu took several minutes to completely absorb it.

At this moment, Qin Yu’s injuries had recovered by more than half. The immense wound that Xing Xiu had split open had already healed by more than half.

A great sense of satisfaction came from his divine sense, and the burning pain in his soul disappeared significantly. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

However, a great sense of desire made Qin Yu’s eyes turn wild suddenly.

That was the soul’s need, and every cell seemed madly complaining about it.

Even the leading divine sense was resisting Qin Yu’s will.

Pure Heart Sutra!

Qin Yu sat cross-legged on the ground and started to circulate the Pure Heart Sutra.

Previously, when he used the Netherworld Meridian Circulation Technique, he suppressed it with the Pure Heart Sutra.

However, at this moment, the Pure Heart Formula had become much less effective. He had to circulate the Meridian Circulation Technique for almost a day and a night before he could barely suppress that terrifying restlessness.

When he got up from cross-legged sitting, he realized his head was covered in a cold sweat.

It seemed even more terrifying when a True Saint circulated the Netherworld Meridian Circulation Technique.

He soon absorbed the Nascent Souls of the two divine senses of the True Saints. The thirst for the souls shocked him.

If he could not suppress it, he would probably turn into a murderous lunatic.

“F*ck, is this person a pervert? He wiped out Chang Hu’s and Ta Shan’s teams straightaway!”

“Fortunately, I felt something wrong and didn’t make a move just now.”

“Let’s go quickly. Don’t attract this person’s attention.”

…

Several divine senses had been observing the situation in this area. At this moment, they hurriedly retreated when they saw Qin Yu stand up.

“Hiss!”

Qin Yu suddenly felt that desire again. Fortunately, under the effect of the Pure Heart Sutra, that feeling was not so strong.

Qin Yu stood up. Suddenly, his pupils constricted.

A man and a sword suddenly stood up.

It was such a strange feeling. This person seemed to have been here for a long time, but at the same time, he seemed to have just arrived.

A feeling of palpitation came over, and Qin Yu was vigilant to the extreme.

“When your injuries heal, I’ll come to take your life.”

The man slowly stood up.

“My name is Xi Menn.”

The man drew out his sword and suddenly slashed at the sky.

The heaven and earth suddenly darkened, and an immense ravine appeared in the sky.

The sky opened, and the person was gone.

Qin Yu gasped.

The force of the rules!

Looking at the immense ravine in the sky, he did not know if he could withstand such a terrifying slash.

“Let’s return to Solitary Cloud City first,” thought Qin Yu.

At this moment, Qin Yu could not be bothered to conserve his spiritual power. After he plundered the treasures of a few of them, he used Shrinking Ground Into An Inch to rush to Solitary Cloud City.

Purgatory, the disordered land, lived up to its reputation!

Including Chang Hu’s invitation and everything that happened after that, it was only natural.

But he did not expect Chang Hu’s team to have prepared themselves to attack him.

This kind of scheming was simply terrifying.

These people who had trained in the sea of blood were indeed fiercer and more ruthless than those in the Holy Region.

And that arrogant Xi Menn in the end, made him feel the danger of life and death.

The purgatory was so terrifying.
