Chapter 1146: Chapter 1,146, meeting Tian Jizi 

After listening to Jiang he’s words, Qin Yu roughly understood what he meant.

Qin Yu’s base number was greater than Jiang he’s, so his strength naturally increased more!

“In other words, if I cultivate to the same level as you, the strength that I can unleash will be even more terrifying,”Qin Yu said in a deep voice.

Jiang he nodded slightly and said, “That’s right.”

Qin Yu continued, “Senior Jiang he, how long did it take you to cultivate the fifth level of the battle character Mantra?”

Jiang he was silent for a moment before he said, “If I remember correctly, it was thirty-two days.”

Thirty-two days!

This speed was far beyond Qin Yu’s imagination!

He originally thought that Jiang he had spent at least a few years, but he didn’t expect it to only take him thirty days!

“Of course, I spent all my time studying the Dou character formula during those thirty days. At the same time, the fifth level is my limit,”Jiang he said slowly.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “Senior Jiang he, I understand.”

After accompanying Jiang he through the entire mountain range, when they came down, Yao Meng and the others were already waiting for them.

“My surname is Yao, and my surname is Yao too. Do We have relatives? Am I older than you? No, according to seniority, you should call me uncle.”

As soon as they entered the door, they heard Yao Qing calling them relatives.

Yao Meng, who was at the side, appeared a little helpless. She smiled bitterly and said, “Okay, okay, whatever you say.”

Seeing Qin Yu walking over, Yao Meng seemed to have grabbed onto a life-saving straw. She quickly stood up and said, “Qin Yu, everyone is ready. We are waiting for you.”

“Okay,”Qin Yu replied.

He swept his gaze across the crowd and discovered that there were more than ten people with him this time. There were many unfamiliar faces.

Qin Yu did not ask any further. After all, this operation was initiated by Yao Meng.

The group walked out of the second secret realm and took a car to look for Tian Jizi.

According to the information Yao Meng provided, Tian Jizi’s residence was in a temple deep in the mountains.

This temple was called the Temple of Divine Secrets, and its location was extremely secretive.

The temple was surrounded by a forest of mountains, and they seemed to be in a Yin gathering pit.

The group of people came to the door of the Temple of divine secrets. Qin Yu raised his head to look at this unremarkable temple, and he couldn’t help but feel a trace of reverence in his heart.

“The legendary Tian Jizi actually lives in this kind of place? It’s not quite the same as I imagined,”Yao Qing muttered.

Qin Yu nodded slightly.

This place was surrounded by mountains on all sides. It was an ominous place on the feng shui. It was easy to gather dark energy.

However, there was not a single trace of dark energy in the Divine Secrets Temple. Instead, it was emitting a trace of peaceful energy.

The group of people walked to the front door of the temple. Yao Meng stopped in her tracks and said, “Come one by one. Let’s make arrangements.”

“I’ll listen to you,”Qin Yu said.

Yao Meng didn’t refuse and let her arrange the order.

Qin Yu was ranked fifth, so the first one was naturally Yao Meng.

This must be a long process. After all, everyone had something they wanted to know.

Qin Yu sat at the door of the temple and closed his eyes slightly.

He didn’t waste any time. He seized all the free time and used it to understand the fighting formula.

The rest of the people were chatting.

They seemed to be discussing what questions to ask.

About an hour later, Yao Meng walked out of the Temple of divine secrets.

The second person to enter was Xiao Yuan. He also spent more than an hour.

According to this progress, it would take at least five to six hours before it was Qin Yu’s turn.

The sky gradually darkened. A Ray of Sunset Light passed through the forest and sprinkled on the temple of divine secrets. The Temple of divine secrets emitted an extremely sacred golden light.

At this moment, Qin Yu opened his eyes slightly.

In just a few short hours, Qin Yu had successfully comprehended the fourth level of the battle character manual.

“Brother Qin, What’s Wrong?”Someone beside him asked.

Qin Yu shook his head. Although he didn’t say anything, he wanted to know how much power could be unleashed at the fourth level of the battle character manual.

“Qin Yu, it’s Your Turn.”

At this moment, Yao Meng suddenly said.

Qin Yu grunted and stood up from the ground. Then, he walked into the Divine Armament Temple.

The temple was extremely simple and crude. It was very different from what he had imagined.

There weren’t any huge statues here, nor were there any sacred spiritual artifacts. There were only ordinary cooking pots and pans, as well as three futons.

An old man with gray hair sat in the center of the temple. Beside him stood two young men, who seemed to be his disciples.

Qin Yu walked up to Tian Jizi and bowed slightly.

Just as he was about to speak, Tian Jizi said, “Qin Yu, you can only ask three questions. Choose the three most important questions from the ones you want to ask.”

Qin Yu frowned slightly. He sat opposite Tian Jizi and pondered for a moment. In the end, he chose the most important question.

He took a deep breath and was about to speak when Tian Jizi interrupted Qin Yu again.

“Do you want to know when you will meet Yan Ruoxue?”Tian Jizi asked.

Qin Yu was stunned. Then, he cupped his hands and said, “Senior is indeed a master. You can predict things like God.”

Tian Jizi slightly closed his eyes and said, “Let’s change the question.”

Qin Yu frowned and asked, “Why?”

“Mr. Qin, there are some questions that the teacher can’t answer and doesn’t want to answer,”said the young man next to him.

Qin Yu opened his mouth and couldn’t help but be a little speechless.

He had no choice but to change the question.

Qin Yu stared at Tian Jizi in front of him and said, “Senior, I want to know what kind of state I will reach in the future, how far I will go, and how long it will take me to reach this step.”

This time, Tianji Zi did not reject Qin Yu.

He opened his eyes and raised a finger to point at Qin Yu’s forehead.

This finger seemed to penetrate Qin Yu’s divine sense. Everything was seen through by him.Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om
