Chapter 1101: Chapter 1,101, Xiao Yuan and the immortal slaying sect 

“The inner core of a demonic beast at the martial saint stage is indeed extraordinary.”Qin Yu stared at the two inner cores and said in a low voice.

However, for some unknown reason, Qin Yu felt a faint sense of guilt.

Perhaps it was because of his relationship with the immortal crane that Qin Yu felt a faint sense of sympathy towards the demonic beasts.

“This demonic beast hasn’t even taken human form and hasn’t even formed a complete divine sense. It should be different from the immortal crane and the others.”Qin Yu comforted himself in his heart.

Then, he stopped thinking and began to absorb the two demonic beast’s inner core.

The inner core hung above Qin Yu’s head, and strands of Qi hung down.

The Spiritual Qi contained in the inner core was extremely pure. Perhaps it was because it was born at the bottom of the sea and had not been contaminated, resulting in the spiritual Qi far surpassing that of the Demonic Beast’s inner core on the continent.

Although the spiritual Qi in the inner core was extremely pure, it also had a disadvantage, which was that the speed of absorption was extremely slow.

Qin Yu spent an entire afternoon before he absorbed even half of it.

“This won’t do.”Qin Yu couldn’t help but frown.

Seeing that the holy region was about to open, the higher-ups of the first mystic realm could come at any time.

For Qin Yu, he had to improve his strength as soon as possible.

Looking at the two demonic Beast’s inner core in front of him, Qin Yu fell into silence. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

After thinking for a moment, he put away the two inner core of the demonic beasts.

“Raising my realm now might not be the best way,”Qin Yu thought to himself.

Other than increasing his cultivation, there were many other ways to increase his strength.

For example, cultivation techniques, and the physical body.

Qin Yu’s physical body was said to be unparalleled in the world. With the addition of the saintly body technique, almost no one in the world could compare to it.

However, the saintly body technique was not a high-level technique. With the increase in Qin Yu’s strength, the effect of the saintly body technique was also negligible.

Even the vajra saintly body technique that he obtained from the martial arts association in Jingdu was not worth mentioning to Qin Yu.

“Body tempering should be the best method,”Qin Yu thought to himself.

However, the requirements for body tempering were too harsh. One needed at least the fire of extreme yang. It was almost impossible to find the fire of extreme yang.

I can only place my hopes on the inheritance left by my father, Qin Yu thought to himself.

He closed his eyes slightly and looked for a spell that could improve his body.

After an entire night, Qin Yu finally found a spell that was quite compatible with it.

This spell was called the azure wood true body. It was a heaven-rank spell that had an extremely strong improvement on the body. It was a divine rank spell.

The green wood true body was divided into ten small realms. Every increase in level would bring about a huge increase.

Other than the green wood true body, there was another technique that could solve the urgent situation.

That was the battle word formula that Jiang he had taught him.

The battle word formula was also divided into ten small realms. The effects of each realm were completely different.

For example, Qin Yu was only at the beginning of the battle word formula. Once he used it, his strength could almost double.

On the other hand, Jiang he’s ‘fighting’formula was even more brilliant. With the help of the ‘fighting’formula, his strength could even increase by dozens of times!

‘I wonder what stage senior Jiang he’s ‘fighting’formula is at,’Qin Yu thought to himself.

Under normal circumstances, the strength of a mighty figure was at least hundreds of times that of an ordinary martial saint. The gap between the two was huge.

However, as a chaotic body, Qin Yu had the ability to fight against those of a higher level. If he used the ‘fighting’formula, it was not impossible for him to fight.

“If I can’t find a way to improve rapidly on cloud dragon island, then I can only place my hopes on the ‘fighting’formula and the ‘Green Wood True Body’.”

Qin Yu slowly stood up. He looked out of the window at the boundless sea with a heavy heart.

The ship was still slowly walking on the sea surface.

According to the captain’s calculation, it would take five days to reach Cloud Dragon Island.

Four days had passed, and they were getting closer and closer to Cloud Dragon Island.

“At most, we will arrive at Cloud Dragon Island in a day’s journey,”Qin Yu thought to himself.

He no longer hid in his room. Instead, he stood up and walked to the deck, looking into the distance.

“Mr. Qin.”

At this moment, Chu Hedao walked over from the side.

Qin Yu turned around and looked at Chu Hedao. He cupped his hands and said, “Brother Chu.”

Chu hedao said, “Mr. Qin, there’s something I don’t know if I should tell you.”

Qin Yu was slightly surprised. He nodded and said, “Feel free to tell me.”

Chu Hedao looked around. Then, he extended his palm and sealed the space between the two of them.

Qin Yu couldn’t help but be a little surprised.

After Chu Hedao sealed the space, the sound of the raging waves disappeared without a trace. Almost nothing could be heard.

“What a brilliant spatial technique,”Qin Yu said in surprise.

Chu Hedao didn’t respond to his internal QI. Instead, he said with a heavy heart, “Do you feel that there is a strange aura on Xiao Yuan’s body? This kind of Aura doesn’t seem to come from the current era.”

Qin Yu was even more surprised.

In fact, he had already noticed that there was something strange about Xiao Yuan, but he didn’t know where it came from.

“You mean... he was possessed?”Qin Yu asked in puzzlement.

“No.”Chu Hedao shook his head.

“Based on my understanding of Xiao Yuan, he would rather die than be possessed. According to my guess, he should have obtained some kind of inheritance.”

“Inheritance?”Qin Yu frowned slightly.

What exactly did this inheritance refer to?

Qin Yu also obtained his father’s inheritance, but this didn’t seem to be anything surprising.

Chu hedao said, “His inheritance is somewhat similar to the immortal slaying sect.”

Upon hearing this, Qin Yu’s expression instantly changed.

“Immortal slaying sect? Isn’t that the sect where the Heavenly Blood Rainbow Is?”Qin Yu exclaimed.

Chu hedao coldly said, “I have a feeling that the heavenly blood rainbow might just be a puppet.”

“You mean... Xiao Yuan is the real instigator? !”Upon hearing this, Qin Yu turned pale with fright!
