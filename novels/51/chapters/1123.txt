Chapter 1124: Chapter 1,124, the fourth transformation of the nine transformation golden pill! 

Chang Mang’s face was filled with anger. Even in the face of a mighty figure, he did not have the slightest bit of fear.

The pavilion master at the side kept shaking his head at him, afraid that Chang Mang would mess things up and cause Tian Zong to start a massacre.

Chang Mang took a deep breath and suppressed the anger in his heart.

Following that, he took a step forward and said in a deep voice, “Senior Tian Zong, as the saying goes, every injustice has its head, and every debt has its owner. Even if you are a mighty figure, you should not at least randomly kill the innocent.”

“Moreover, Qin Yu will come back very soon. He is definitely not someone who will run away at the last minute.”

Tian Zong snorted coldly and said, “I have already waited for him for five days. Do I have to wait for him for the rest of my life?”

Chang mang sneered and said, “Let me ask you, if Qin Yu is someone who ran away at the last minute, do you think it will be useful to him if you kill everyone in the Heaven Gate? He will also not come back.”

“If he wasn’t that kind of person, the result would be the same whether you killed him or not. Even if you didn’t kill anyone, he would still come back.”

“So What’s the use of you killing everyone? Other than causing trouble for yourself and tarnishing your reputation, what other benefits do you have?”

Although Chang Mang’s words were rude, there were details in them. His words were not without reason.

Even the pavilion master didn’t expect such a rude person like Chang Mang to say such words.

Tian Zong was silent for a moment. He didn’t make a sound for a long time.

“If you start a massacre, guess what the people outside will say? Scold Qin Yu? I reckon they’ll say that the Almighty realm is only So-so,”Chang Mang continued.

Tian Zong slightly raised his brows and said, “Then what do you think we should do?”

“What else can we do? Wait for Qin Yu to come back,”said Chang Mang.

“What if he doesn’t come back? How long do I have to wait for him?”Asked Tian Zong.

Chang Mang patted his chest and said, “If Qin Yu doesn’t come back in three days, I’m willing to replace him.”

“Okay!”The Teacup in Tian Zong’s hand was heavily placed on the table.

He sized up Chang Mang and said, “I’ll give you the last three days.”

“It’s a deal. Whoever goes back on his word is my son,”Chang Mang said.

After saying this, Chang Mang turned around and left.

Pavilion master sat there with her mouth agape. She had never expected that the negotiation this time would end like this.

Then, pavilion master hurriedly stood up and said goodbye to Tian Zong before following him out.

“I really didn’t expect that Tian Zong would actually be persuaded by you,”Pavilion Master couldn’t help but sigh.

Chang Mang said with some pride, “That’s when people think that I, Chang Mang, am stupid. In fact, I’m smarter than him!”

Hearing this, the pavilion master, who had always been serious, couldn’t help but burst out laughing.

“I have to say, you’ve rendered meritorious service this time.”Pavilion master said.

“But... what if Qin Yu doesn’t return three days later?”

Chang Mang said, “Then I’ll exchange blows with him. It’s not a waste of my life to be able to exchange blows with a mighty figure.”

Although he said it with ease, pavilion master was a little worried.

“I hope that in three days... Qin Yu can successfully break through,”pavilion master said with a slight sigh.

...

At this time, Qin Yu had already swallowed five more sky origin pills.

The intermediate stage of the martial saint realm was right in front of him.

Qin Yu did not delay at all as he swallowed another heavenly origin pill.

As this heavenly origin pill started to evaporate in his body, Qin Yu’s realm also began to slowly rise.

“Finally!”Qin Yu’s eyes lit up and a trace of relief flashed across his face.

He sat cross-legged on the ground and slowly felt the increase in his strength.

From the early-stage of the martial saint realm to the intermediate stage of the Martial Saint Realm, one did not need to go through the heavenly tribulation. Therefore, Qin Yu did not feel any pressure in his heart.

“Buzz!”

As the primordial spirit in his body flickered with light, Qin Yu’s realm had officially advanced from the early stage of the Martial Saint Realm to the middle stage of the Martial Saint Realm!

He suddenly opened his eyes, and a dazzling light emitted from his eyes.

This light penetrated through the seawater and almost split the seawater in half!

“Crack! Crack! Crack!”

Just as Qin Yu was about to get up, his body suddenly underwent a transformation!

Cracking sounds burst out from all over his body, and his body was in pain!

Qin Yu looked at his body in horror, and a trace of uneasiness flashed across his heart!

“What... What’s going on?”Qin Yu said with a trembling voice.

This kind of fear towards the unknown made even Qin Yu Panic!

“Crack!” RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

With a crisp sound, Qin Yu’s body almost exploded!

Just as Qin Yu was at a loss, he suddenly thought of something!

Nine Transformation Golden Pill!

Qin Yu had once swallowed a nine transformation golden pill, and at that time, Qin Yu had only completed the first three transformations!

One had to know that a nine transformation golden pill was very likely to accompany a cultivator for a lifetime, and it would take a lifetime to complete the nine transformations!

“Kacha!”

The flesh of the body continued to collapse, and fresh blood dyed the seabed red.

This fresh blood also attracted countless sea creatures. They rushed towards Qin Yu, but could not Shake Qin Yu’s flesh at all!

After that, the flesh began to slowly heal, but before the healing was completed, it collapsed again!

“It really is the nine transformation golden pill!”At this moment, Qin Yu confirmed his thoughts!

He never expected that the nine transformation golden pill would begin its fourth transformation at this time!

“Get Well, get well, I need a strong physical body!”Qin Yu’s eyes emitted a bright light!

“When I complete the fourth transformation of the nine transformation Golden Pill, my physical body will definitely be on a higher level!”

“In this way, I will naturally have more confidence in fighting Tian Zong!”

Thinking of this, Qin Yu closed his eyes slightly.

He used his divine sense to guide the fourth transformation of the nine transformation golden pill.

His body broke down and reassembled under the sea.

Pieces of white bones flickered with sparkling light.

The white bones were like jade, sparkling and translucent, not stained by dust.

The sound of popping could be heard under the sea. The temperature of Qin Yu’s body kept rising, as if it was going to boil the sea water!

Countless sea creatures rushed towards Qin Yu. After their teeth broke, they left dejectedly.

One day and one night.

Qin Yu’s fourth rotation continued.

At this moment, Qin Yu’s body had already been destroyed over 500 times.
