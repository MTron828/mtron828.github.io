The two white-robed men’s expressions changed drastically when they saw Qin Yu!

“You... you broke out of prison?” The two men asked in confusion.

Qin Yu couldn’t be bothered with them. He grabbed their collars and threw them out.

“Go back and tell Xie Qu that I’ll break his legs if he comes to the Green Moon Villa again,” Qin Yu said coldly.

The two white-robed men didn’t dare to say anything and ran away.

“Mr. Qin, I knew you would be fine!” Zhen Yue said excitedly.

Qin Yu smiled and then asked, “Has there been anything wrong with the Green Moon Villa these days?”

“No, it’s just that the people from the Jingdu Martial Arts Association came,” Zhen Yue said.

Qin Yu grunted and said, “I’ll be cultivating in the Green Moon Villa these days. Call me if there’s anything.”

After saying a few words to Zhen Yue, Qin Yu headed straight for the Spiritual Spring.

This Spiritual Spring was extremely mysterious. It was said that the Saint Confucian Sect had started from this Spiritual Spring.

It wasn’t Qin Yu’s first time here, so he knew where the fastest cultivation place was.

After arriving at the bottom of the Spiritual Spring, Qin Yu sat down cross-legged and began to absorb the Spiritual Energy from the Spiritual Spring.

I wonder what the origin of this Spiritual Spring is, Qin Yu thought to himself.

If he could find the source of this Spiritual Spring, perhaps his cultivation would be countless times faster.

At this time, Qin Yu suddenly thought of something: Iceheart!

Qin Yu only used a small portion of the Iceheart that was obtained from the Iceheart Lake last time!

Ever since Qin Yu borrowed Iceheart to step into the Martial Marquis realm, he had forgotten about this Iceheart!

The Spiritual Energy in the Iceheart was extremely pure, and it was also the purest Spiritual Energy Qin Yu had ever obtained!

Thinking of this, he hurriedly took out the Iceheart from the Spatial Magic Artifact.

This piece of Iceheart in Qin Yu’s hand flickered with a light blue light, and there was even a strong surge of Spiritual Energy coming from it!

“With this Iceheart, why would I need to borrow this Spiritual Spring?” Qin Yu couldn’t help but say excitedly.

He immediately broke off a small piece of the Iceheart and stuffed it into his mouth.

Pure Spiritual Energy immediately spread throughout Qin Yu’s body.

His entire body was filled with Spiritual Energy, and after the Spiritual Energy circulated in his body, it would surge into the golden core.

Qin Yu’s golden core was only the size of a bean. With the injection of Spiritual Energy, the golden core seemed to grow bigger bit by bit.

Endless amounts of Spiritual Energy flowed into his body, and Qin Yu’s cultivation was also quietly increasing.

At the same time, the news of Qin Yu being rescued had already spread.

All the aristocratic families who heard the news were instantly furious! The young masters of the aristocratic families also felt waves of pressure!

And the most furious ones were the Yan and Han families.

The enmity between them and Qin Yu had reached a point where things couldn’t be remedied, so Qin Yu had to die!

Jingdu Martial Arts Association.

Han Meng and Yan Sihai came to Qu Xie’s office together.

“President Qu, why was Qin Yu rescued?” Han Meng asked unhappily.

Yan Sihai cursed, “Qu Xie, what the hell are you doing? How can a cooked duck fly?”

Qu Xie was even more displeased now. He said with a dark expression, “If this guy doesn’t die, he will become a great enemy of Jingdu Martial Arts Association. Do you think I don’t want him to die?”

“Ye Qing came with a group of people to rescue him personally. What can I do? Don’t you have a good relationship with him? Go find someone and take Ye Qing’s position!”

Yan Sihai said with a cold expression, “Qu Xie, are you serious?”

Qu Xie gritted his teeth and said, “Yes, but you can’t blame me for this.”

Yan Sihai sneered and said, “You can’t kill him, right? Fine, then my family will send someone to kill him!”

“Also, I’m telling you, if Qin Yu can’t die, give Yan Ruoxue back to me!”

After saying this, Yan Sihai turned around and left.

Han Meng was naturally not as tough as Yan Sihai. Although he was anxious, he didn’t dare to flare up.

“President Qu, we should think of another way. If Qin Yu doesn’t die, who knows what he will do,” said Han Meng.

Qu Xie nodded and said, “Yes, the Jingdu Martial Arts Association will send purple-robed men to kill Qin Yu.”

“Of course, it would be better if the Han family is willing to help.”

Han Meng nodded and said, “Don’t worry. Ma Hai’s master has been looking for Qin Yu.”

Qu Xie glanced at Han Meng and said with a nonchalant smile, “Let Han Xiu handle this matter.”

Han Meng’s expression turned ugly, but it was impossible to hide it now.

After Han Meng returned home, Han Xiu was already waiting on the sofa.

He was wearing a black mink coat and was sitting there in a domineering manner.

“Han Xiu? What are you doing here?” Han Meng couldn’t help but frown when he saw this.

Han Xiu took a bite of the apple and said indifferently, “Dad said that you shouldn’t interfere in Qin Yu’s matter.”

Han Meng immediately said anxiously, “I will take care of this matter! It won’t be long before Qin Yu is dead!”

Han Xiu sneered and said, “You have said this many times. I’m tired of hearing it. Dad is also tired of hearing it.”

Han Meng still wanted to explain, but Han Xiu did not give him a chance at all.

Han Xiu walked out of the door and muttered, “What a pity. I thought you could establish ties with the Yan family, but in the end, you’re nothing.”

Facing Han Xiu’s insult, although Han Meng was angry, there was nothing he could do!

Because between the two brothers, Han Xiu’s ability was much stronger than Han Meng’s!

More importantly, Han Xiu was also at the peak of the Martial Marquis Realm! Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

This made Han Meng completely lose the opportunity to compete with Han Xiu.

In the next few days, the entire Jingdu seemed calm and peaceful, but in fact, it was surging with tension.

For several days in a row, Qin Yu did not leave the Spiritual Spring.

He spent a few days before he successfully digested a small piece of Iceheart.

And that pure Spiritual Energy brought Qin Yu great benefits. He was only one step away from the middle stage of the Martial Marquis Realm.

‘If I devour another small piece of Iceheart, I should be able to step into the mid-stage of the Martial Marquis Realm. When that time comes, I will at least have the strength to fight against the purple-robed men,’ Qin Yu thought to himself.

However, what Qin Yu didn’t expect was that the various aristocratic families and the Jingdu Martial Arts Association were quietly making their moves.

Qin Yu stood up from the ground. He stretched his back and planned to eat something.

At this moment, a sneaky figure appeared in front of Qin Yu.

“Tsk, you actually didn’t die. You’re really lucky.” The mustached man squatted on the ground with a wretched look.

Qin Yu rolled his eyes at him and said, “Alright, stop talking nonsense. How’s the matter going?”

The mustached man spread his hands and said, “Most of the ingredients have been gathered. There’s only one thing left. I came here for the last ingredient.”

Qin Yu nodded slightly. Qin Yu remembered clearly that the last material needed to be picked up by him.

“Then don’t waste time. Let’s go quickly,” said Qin Yu.
