2199 The Black Platform Continent

“Go ahead.”

Qin Yu said indifferently.

“Brother, is this your first time coming to the Black Platform Continent?”

“So what if that’s the case?

“As expected.”

Elder Lin nodded. “Although the Black Platform Continent isn’t big, it’s a hub that connects all the major galaxies. Therefore, many forces have set up their camps here, including the Heavenly Cloud Continent, the Land of Nightmares, Inferno Hell, and so on. Black Platform City even has the coordinates of the Holy Region. If we fight here, I’m afraid it won’t do good to Brother. Many people will be dissatisfied with Brother.”

“Holy Region! Bring me there!”

Qin Yu’s pupils constricted. He stretched out his hand and grabbed Elder Lin. His palm was like an iron clamp, almost suffocating the elderly man

“Stop, you dare to touch my Lin family’s elder in Black Platform City, are you courting death?”

Lin Cheng said coldly.

Seven or eight figures with powerful internal qi appeared around the elderly man In an instant, various internal qi locked onto Qin Yu.

“I’ll only give you one chance to attack.”

Qin Yu said indifferently.

“Outrageous! Break his limbs and I will personally send him to purgatory!”

Lin Cheng was furious.

He was one of the elites of the younger generation in the Black Platform Continent and had grown up under the protection of the three great aristocratic families, the Lin family. He had never experienced such humiliation before.

“Die!”

The elderly man’s face flashed as he thrust his sword into the air. It was like throwing a bomb into a calm lake.

For a moment, sword energy erupted.

“Severed Wave!”

The violent sword energy directly blasted toward Qin Yu.

Qin Yu was expressionless. He threw a punch and all the sword energy suddenly dispersed.

“This brat is powerful. Set up the formation!”

The elderly man’s pupils shrank and he suddenly stepped back thousands of feet away to join forces with the seven people behind him who emanated powerful internal qi.

“Formation again?”

Qin Yu’s gaze was intense and fiery. Seeing the eight people surrounding him, he did not stop them.

“What an arrogant cultivator. I’ll definitely make you suffer later.”

Elder Lin roared.

“Everyone, attack with all your might! We must kill him in one blow! This person must have some treasures on him, or else he won’t be so arrogant!”

Lin Cheng commanded from behind.

“Brother, forget it. The Divine Annihilation Formation is too lethal, and he doesn’t have any enmity with us.”

Lin Huan suddenly stopped him.

Qin Yu stared expressionlessly at the woman in white who suddenly appeared.

“I can spare you. Kneel and cripple your cultivation, and hand over all the treasures on you.”

Lin Cheng grinned.

“Brother.”

“Shut up! He dared to provoke our Lin family and act so presumptuously on the Black Platform Continent. I don’t know how many people like him I’ve killed. If I don’t capture this fellow today, everyone will think that our Lin family is easy to bully!”

Lin Cheng angrily rebuked.

“Brat, I don’t know where you came from, but a man who is too stubborn is prone to experiencing setbacks. Attack!’

The sword in Elder Lin’s hand shone tremendously brightly, and the dazzling light seemed to cover the light in the sky.

The seven Reversion Void Stage cultivators attacked at the same time.

The strange thing was that their attacks were actually aimed in Elder Lin’s direction.

After passing through the circulation of the formation, it seemed that all the spiritual energy had gathered on Elder Lin’s body, and the sharpness was even stronger than the seven of them combined.

“Sky Piercing!”

A bright sword stabbed out in front of Qin Yu, carrying the aura of a True Saint.

“Crack!”

Qin Yu’s two fingers gently clamped the sword. The sword stopped and the clouds dispersed.

The cultivation of this galaxy’s cultivator was not comparable to that of the Holy Region, but they seemed to have taken a different direction.

They seemed to pay more attention to the artifacts in formation. Otherwise, these few people would not even be qualified to make a move on Qin Yu.

“Die!”

Elder Lin suddenly spat a mouthful of blood onto the sword in front of him. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

The illusory sword in Qin Yu’s hand let out a clear sword hum, and it trembled violently between his fingers.

Following that, it suddenly struggled out and stabbed Qin Yu’s chest.

Wu Ji’s divine robe on Qin Yu’s body moved, and the sword hum suddenly dispersed as if it was pinched out of his throat.

“Pfft!”

The eight of them spat out blood and fell at the same time. The enhancement of formation allowed them to unleash a True Saint attack, but the backlash was tremendous too.

“You’re actually fine?”

Elder Lin’s face filled with shock.

Qin Yu looked calm. With his body tempered by the heavenly tribulation in the void and the robe left behind by Senior Wu Ji, such an attack was like a tickle in his eyes.

This feeling of power was just like Si Liuhe’s when he had just broken through.

Now, he was confident that he could fight Si Shiyue or even Si Liuhe.

“Bring me to the teleportation formation.”

Qin Yu grabbed Lin Cheng like he was grabbing a chick.

“Don’t kill me, don’t kill me! The teleportation formation is in the center of Black Platform City. I’ll bring you there right away.”

Lin Cheng was petrified. Qin Yu’s indifferent gaze made him not doubt that he would kill him at any time like crushing a chicken.

“Senior, are you going to the Holy Region?”

The white-clad woman, Lin Huan, respectfully bowed and said.

“Yes.”

“Senior, don’t rush. It seems that Senior really came from the Holy Region and doesn’t know much about this place.”

Lin Huan smiled bitterly.

“What do you mean?”

“The Holy Region is no different from a legendary place to our Black Platform Continent. Not to mention if the coordinates in the formation are accurate, the amount of spiritual essence it requires is probably the entire Black Platform Continent combined.”

Lin Huan smiled bitterly.

Qin Yu could not help but frown when he heard this. Right now, he only wanted to return to the Holy Region.

Sixty years had passed since he made the promise with Si Shiyue. He did not want to waste his time here.

“Even if you were to go to the Cloud Splendor Continent, it requires several thousands of spiritual essence.”

“What is spiritual essence? Is it spiritual stones?”

“Spiritual essence is formed from extremely compressed spiritual stones. One hundred million spiritual stones can only be compressed into a single spiritual essence. The energy it contained was extremely massive, and it was especially used for the cultivation or spatial teleportation of True Saint cultivators.”

Lin Huan continued to explain.

“Senior, if you want to go to the legendary Holy Region, there are only three ways.”

“First, you have to gather enough spiritual essence. You can obtain it by plundering, working in the guild, or killing Demonic Beasts. The second was to obtain an interstellar travel warship, but it required a long travel time and precise coordinates. Third, breakthrough to the Tribulation Stage. Rumor has it that cultivators at the Tribulation Stage can defy the heavens and break through the void at will.”

Qin Yu felt a headache. To him at this moment, all three methods seemed to take a huge amount of time.

“Senior, if you don’t mind, the Lin family also has a resting space here. You can go and rest first before making plans.”

Lin Huan said softly.

“Please lead the way.”

Qin Yu threw Lin Cheng on the ground and jumped onto the warship.

Qin Yu looked at a light spot in the middle of the warship. This light spot seemed to have some spatial internal qi.

His divine sense moved and entered the light spot.

There were all kinds of messy items inside, various Beast Spirit Pills and weapons.

There was a faint smell of blood coming from it.

These basically seemed to be looted items.

Qin Yu glanced around. These things were basically not to his liking.

“Hmm?”

With a thought, two spiritual stones emitting powerful energy appeared in his hands.
