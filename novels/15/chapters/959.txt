Chapter 960 The Fool’s Sigh

Upon hearing the name “Gehrman Sparrow,” all the members on both sides of the long bronze table looked at The World. No one spoke or interjected.

They more or less knew that the crazy adventurer, Gehrman Sparrow, had once again done something huge such as killing Admiral Hell Ludwell. However, Audrey didn’t believe that this was the main reason why he would suffer mental problems.

And the way they acted made Leonard instantly realize a fact: Everyone in the Tarot Club knew that The World was Gehrman Sparrow!

Klein’s disguise is really well done... However, why does he let the other members know of his identity as Gehrman Sparrow? Isn’t it common sense to hide one’s background at such gatherings? Amidst his puzzlement, Leonard heard the blurry-figured The World reply with a hoarse voice, “What clues has MI9 obtained?”

Xio showed no shame in betraying MI9 as she replied frankly, “They have confirmed that the identity “Gehrman Sparrow’ is fabricated, and that it was sourced from Backlund.”

Indeed, he was previously known as Sherlock Moriarty. He became Gehrman Sparrow after leaving Backlund. However, Sherlock Moriarty isn’t his real identity either... Leonard subconsciously surveyed the area and realized that, although the other members weren’t surprised, they didn’t seem to show any signs of realizing it. Hence, he believed that their knowledge of Klein was only at the uppermost surface.

Under Klein’s control, The World Gehrman Sparrow chuckled and answered Miss Judgment’s information, “There’s no need to bother about such matters.”

To him, to figure out who the fake identity of Gehrman Sparrow was given to, one had to first capture Queen Mystic Bernadette, or one had to obtain news of Sharron from her. Clearly, the level of difficulty made it nearly impossible!

In comparison, if they did the same as Leonard, starting off from the events in which Detective Sherlock Moriarty was involved in, there was a chance of them figuring out more. However, since MI9 had chosen the wrong direction, Klein was happy to see them take the futile route.

Mr. World is unperturbed and very confident... Xio retracted her gaze and didn’t continue.

At this moment, Audrey deliberated and asked, “Mr. World, will you be returning to Backlund in the future? Will you still use the identity of Dwayne Dantès?”

As a qualified Psychiatrist, she obviously wasn’t going to inform the mental problems of The World to the other members of the Tarot Club. She only wanted to confirm if he would still return to the Loen Charity Bursary Foundation. That way, she could be in closer contact to him in the real world, allowing for a better checkup.

She didn’t conceal the matter about Dwayne Dantès, since the original members already knew of it. As for Mr. Star, he was clearly familiar with Mr. World. As for Xio, she had Fors to inform her ahead of time.

Ah... Upon hearing Miss Justice’s words, Leonard nearly couldn’t believe his ears as he felt a little confused.

Klein Moretti is equivalent to Dwayne Dantès?

I’ve once asked Dwayne Dantès to his face about Klein Moretti...

No, it’s impossible. Dwayne Dantès is an undying creature who has lived since the Fourth Epoch! The way he acted is sufficient proof!

Old Man said the same too!

At that moment, Leonard was unable to control his tumultuous emotions. He instinctively rejected the fact that Miss Justice had conveyed.

If what appeared here was his Astral Projection, he felt that his expressions would be rather obviousoscillating between red and white.

Opposite Leonard, Xio looked up as well, looking at Mr. World with puzzlement.

He’s Dwayne Dantès? Dwayne Dantès is Gehrman Sparrow?

I even accepted his butler’s mission... I even protected him before... I even pitied him...

He can squash me to death with one hand...

Xio then turn her head and glared at Fors.

I don’t dare to say too much about Mr. World. I could only briefly mention a little... Fors turned her eyes away in guilt as she mumbled silently. Alger and Cattleya figured out something from the duo’s reactions:

Miss Magician and Miss Judgment knew each other in the real world.

Miss Judgment had once interacted with Dwayne Dantès before, but she didn’t know that he was Gehrman Sparrow.

As a senior Spectator, Audrey noticed the abnormalities of The Star and Judgment without a doubt. Immediately, she understood that she had made too many assumptions.

Audrey, you need to reflect on this! She said to herself in embarrassment and attempted to make up for it before Mr. World spoke.

“Dwayne Dantès is a public identity. At times, it will be Mr. World, and at other times, it will be the other Blessed of Mr. Fool.”

So that’s how it is... Makes sense! Leonard’s mind stirred as he instantly accepted Miss Justice’s explanation and figured out many different matters.

The Dwayne Dantès that appeared during the period before the breaching of Saint Samuel Cathedral’s Chanis Gate was likely Klein. The periods before and after that was the other Blessed of Mr. Fool... That Death Consul? Indeed, he’s an undying creature who lived since the Fourth Epoch. Old Man’s old friend...

Yes, it might be other Blessed I’m not aware of, but their levels definitely aren’t too low... Uh, other Blessed. Does that mean Klein is also considered Mr. Fool’s Blessed?

It’s no wonder Mr. Fool said that he comes here and participates in the gathering, but the experiences are different from mine... It’s because he’s a Blessed and enjoys the benediction of Mr. Fool, so he also has the ancient aura. It’s why Old Man doesn’t realize that Dwayne Dantès is played by different people?

This explains my previous question. As a Blessed, Gehrman Sparrow doesn’t need to keep his identity a secret...

But to Judgment Xio, Dwayne Dantès being a public identity, or him being Gehrman Sparrow was not her concern. The reason why she overreacted was because, after realizing the truth, she felt embarrassed at all her various thoughts back then.

Seeing the atmosphere return to normal, Klein heaved a sigh of relief inwardly and controlled The World Gehrman Sparrow to answer Miss Justice’s question:

“Yes.

“When the time comes, there might be certain matters that need all of your help.”

When he finished the second half of his sentence, The World swept his gaze across Justice, The Magician, Judgment, The Star, and The Moon.

H-he has plans for something in Backlund? Audrey instantly understood what Mr. World was getting at. She momentarily felt excited but also a little worried.

She was excited because she was about to participate in a secret operation that all the participants didn’t seem to have any ties with, to the point of not even “knowing” each other. This was something she had always looked forward to. Her worries stemmed from whether the operation would have any threat to Backlund’s safety, or if it would bring harm to the innocent.

As for danger to herself, she wasn’t too worried. She believed that Mr. World would arrange for the mission to be held in the outskirts of the city, provide key information, or cause serious misdirection to the target, without needing any direct participation or fighting.

Emlyn was the second person to read between the lines. And this was a result of his innate aversion towards troublesome matters.

Will it be troublesome... he thought with a frown without saying a word. While the other members came to a realization, Alger took a deep look at The World Gehrman Sparrow and said, “I recently received news that the traitor of the Church of Evernight, Archbishop Ince Zangwill, was killed in West Balam. Before that, he had already become a demigod. As for the Sealed Artifact, 0-08, which he had stolen, it’s unknown whose hands it’s in. The only thing that can be certain is that the battlefield was cleared by the Church of Evernight.”

The Hanged Man is very updated on the news... It’s only been a few days... The Church should’ve kept this strictly confidential... However, there might have been other factions arriving at the square that day... Leonard was taken aback for a moment, but he didn’t provide more information.

This was the first time Audrey and company were learning about the news. They could only determine that the matter was rather important from the words “archbishop,” “0-08,” and “demigod.” But since it had nothing to do with them and there wasn’t any stimulus, they weren’t too intrigued. As for Cattleya, as she had a deep impression and understanding of Grade o Sealed Artifacts, she planned on seeking out information on this via Queen Mystic and the Moses Ascetic Order after she returned to the real world.

Amidst a brief silence, The Fool Klein suddenly extended his hand and rapped the table’s surface. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

He felt that he needed to warn all the members.

In the coming years, the waves of the times would come flooding in!

Upon hearing that, all the members straightened their backs or made them even straighter before turning to the seat of honor at the long bronze table. Even the newly joined Leonard and Xio were no exception. It was almost instinctive.

Then, they heard the profound and lofty figure chuckle amidst the gray fog.

“The times have changed as a result.”

The times have changed because of this? Ince Zangwill’s matter is key to something? Although it involves a Grade o Sealed Artifact... Alger, who had shared the news, never expected Mr. Fool to place so much emphasis on it. He was momentarily unsure what to make out of it.

Leonard, who had participated in the matter regarding Ince Zangwill, felt the same. He knew how important and terrifying the Grade o Sealed Artifact was, but he never expected that what happened that day would change the times.

While Audrey and company wore blank looks, they focused fully. Even Derrick couldn’t help but take on an attentive posture.

The Fool Klein surveyed the area and said with a laugh and sigh, “Adam is one step closer to being divine.”
