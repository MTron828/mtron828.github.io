Chapter 885: Two Letters

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Upon hearing Klein’s words, one of the four heads which Reinette Tinekerr held immediately said, “Alright...”

It opened its mouth and immediately sucked back most of the gold coins, where it was stored was an unknown.

Taking a look at the dozens of shiny gold coins left, Klein reached out to receive the rather thick envelope. He quickly opened it and scanned its opening. Indeed, it was the detailed information regarding Spirit World Plunderers.

After Miss Messenger returned to the spirit world, he put away the gold coins, drew the curtains, and sat down under the morning sun, seriously reading the neat and tidy handwriting.

“Thank you once again for your help.

“The Tutanssess II mummy is part of the advancement ritual for me. It holds deep meaning for me.

“Spirit World Plunderers live in the depths of the spirit world. They’re extremely rare, rich in intelligence, and very aggressive. They can capture or kill creatures and make them soul avatars. Their souls can turn into their true soul’s appearance, giving them similar performance and traits. They can also disguise themselves as other spirit world creatures. When encountering them, perhaps all the spirit world creatures around belong to them. They might be soul avatars that mustn’t be neglected.

“This creature can effectively influence the thought processes of their prey, causing them to enter a desensitized state... Their true soul body has potent spirituality. In clashes of such nature, they are often at a noticeable advantage...

“They’re very difficult to find. At present, there is only one place with signs of their activity. The spirit world’s Calderón City.

“This is a legendary city of mysterious and unknown origins. On this front, there are three theories about them. One is that it was once Death’s residence, the entrance to the Underworld. Two, it’s the divine kingdom left behind by a dead ancient deity from the Second Epoch. Attracted by the spirit world, it sank and slowly transformed into a real yet illusory city. Three, it’s a real city that was devoured by the spirit world during the Cataclysm.

“Regardless of the theory, it elucidates one point: This city is very dangerous. It has many special and strange aspects about it...

“I do not have the mysticism coordinates of Calderón City. Most high-level spirit world creatures aren’t aware either...

“I can provide two suggestions. First is to use a special secret deed ritual to pray to Red Light Aiur Moria to receive the corresponding answer. I won’t describe in detail what Red Light is. If you aren’t aware, you can write to ask me again. The second is to find someone from the Abraham family. They have the legacy of the Traveler’s pathway, and they have done a deep exploration of the spirit world...”

Even when writing a letter, Miss Sharron exudes an extremely restrained feeling... Indeed, the Pharaoh mummy is meant for the Puppet’s ritual. Back then, the evil spirit in the ruin had said that it could be one of the components of the ritual... Therefore, the ritual’s exact requirement is to use a High-Sequence Beyonder’s corpse after death, one that still maintains a level of spirituality, or to use an evil spirit that results from the resentment of death?

Heh heh, can I pray to Orange Light to get “Him” to help me ask Red Light? Hmm, to others, finding Calderón City is a very difficult task, but to me, it’s extremely simple. I can directly give this task to Miss Magician. She has just contributed greatly to the Abraham family...

I hope the first theory about Calderón City is correct. That way, once I make contact with Mr. Azik, I can see the dangerous residents of this mysterious city line up in two rows as they welcome me... Klein shook his head, throwing such a beautiful fantasy to the back of his mind.

He scrutinized the information regarding Spirit World Plunderers and confirmed that they had partial characteristics of Marionettist and Bizarro Sorcerer. They were rather dangerous high-level spirit world creatures.

To make soul avatars have the same appearance, performance, and traits of their true souls is identical to a Bizarro Sorcerer’s ability to give their powers to a marionette... At Zaratul’s level, perhaps at Sequence 3 Scholar of Yore, perhaps he can temporarily give certain Beyonder powers to other creatures that are marionettes? Klein began tearing the letter while in thought as he flicked his wrist and engulfed the letter in scarlet red flames, burning them into ashes that fell into the trash bin.

After reining in his thoughts, while dressed in pajamas, he walked to his bedroom’s door to get Richardson to come in to help him change his clothes.

...

Under Saint Samuel Cathedral.

As usual, Leonard Mitchell was leaning back into his chair with his legs raised on the desk.

There was nothing abnormal about his expression, but he was thinking about Amon deep down.

Ever since he knew that the angel had arrived in Backlund, Pallez Zoroast inside him had become abnormally silent. He wasn’t as active as before to proactively speak or give suggestions.

If not for the answers he received when he posed questions, Leonard would have even suspected that Old Man had secretly sneaked off to find another host to parasitize.

Amidst his thoughts, his Red Gloves captain, Nighthawks deacon, Soest, walked in.

“How was the interrogation? Any results?” The Red Gloves in the room who were dealing with their own matters quickly cast their gaze to the door.

Late last night, they had just finished a mission. They had captured three Numinous Episcopate members that they had been tracking for quite some time. Now, they were awaiting the results of the interrogation.

Soest sternly surveyed the room and said, “We had contributed greatly in this, but the results aren’t something good.

“Based on the testimony of the three Numinous Episcopate members, as well as the information the Church had previously gathered, we can come to a preliminary conclusion that the Numinous Episcopate has fractured between reviving Death or creating Artificial Death. The latter has already achieved some progress and benefited significantly from it.

“They are filled with animosity towards Loen and to us. They plan to put parts of the experiments of Artificial Death in Backlund! Yes, their thoughts are the same as your present concerns. Even if the experiment fails, there’s a chance of severely damaging the Capital of Capitals.”

Leonard instantly snapped out of his daze as he exchanged looks with Cindy and Bob, seeing the surprise and rage in each other’s eyes.

At this moment, Soest rapped the side of the table to stop the members from further discussion.

He cleared his throat and said, “Our new mission is to head to the Southern Continent to find the key members of the Numinous Episcopate’s Artificial Death faction based on clues gleaned from the testimonies we received. We need to figure out how many remnant thorns are left in Backlund before uprooting each and every one of them.

“We will receive help from Ma’am Daly on this mission. And the Church will give her the potion as an advanced payment, helping her prepare the ritual so that she can become a Gatekeeper before she heads off.

“In addition, the high-ranking deacon in charge of the Southern Continent, Her Excellency ‘The Goddess’s Eye’ EyeIlya, and the local Nighthawks, will provide us with help, giving us the corresponding Sealed Artifacts and helping us with the preliminary investigations.

“Ladies and gentlemen, head back to rest for a day and prepare yourselves. We will set off tomorrow night.”

“Yes, Captain!” Cindy, Bob, and company stood up and replied.

Leonard stood up as well, but he didn’t say a word. The first thought that flashed in his mind was: I can use this opportunity to leave Backlund to escape the threat of Amon!

After returning to 7 Pinster Street, he asked with a suppressed tone after closing the door and drawing the curtains, “Old Man, problem solved.

“I believe a normal assignment for Red Gloves won’t garner the suspicion of Amon, right?”

The slightly aged voice in his mind replied slowly, “No.”

Leonard could tell that Old Man’s voice appeared much more relaxed. As his mind stirred, he considered for a moment and said, “Should I write to Klein Moretti and tell him that we will be leaving Backlund for a very long period of time? After all, he was the one who warned us that Amon is here...”

Pallez Zoroast replied in the same tone, “Write it if you wish.”

Leonard exhaled, pulled out a piece of paper, and picked up a fountain pen.

He deliberated for a moment and lowered his wrist to write:

“I have a mission that will require me to leave Backlund.”

Looking at this short sentence, Leonard put down his pen and folded the letter.

Soon, he finished preparing the ritual to summon the messenger. He lit a candle, took a step back, and said in ancient Hermes, “I!

“I summon in my name:

“The spirit that wanders about the unfounded, the friendly creature that can be subordinated, the messenger that belongs to Gehrman Sparrow.”

The howling of wind sounded in the room as it turned intense.

The candlelight burgeoned as it was tainted with paleness. A beautiful blonde, red-eyed head appeared from within.

Leonard pricked his brows, and just as he was about to speak, he saw that what followed the head wasn’t a complete neck, but a hand grabbing the hair.

Reinette Tinekerr, in her dark and complicated dress, quickly walked out. The four heads in her hand turned in unison to look at Leonard Mitchell as they spoke one after another, “You...” “Want to...” “Send...” “A letter?”

This spirit world creature looks powerful... This is a perk that Klein has for joining that secret organization? As Leonard thought, he nodded and said, “Yes.”

The four heads held by Reinette Tinekerr spoke one after another:

“You need...” “To pay...” “One...” “Gold coin...”

One gold coin? Messengers from the mysterious world also collect money? Leonard was somewhat astounded but was at a loss for a reaction. All he could do was reach into his pocket and take out a gold coin.

Only then did Reinette Tinekerr raise two of her blonde, red-eyed heads to grab the letter and gold coin.

Following that, she stepped into the void and vanished.

After the candle was restored to normal, Leonard muttered with a laugh, “What a strange messenger...”

Just as he said that, the slightly aged voice of Pallez Zoroast echoed in his mind.

“It’s best you do not speak negatively behind ‘Her’ back.”

...”Her”? Old Man actually addressed a messenger as a “Her”? A messenger can be a “Her”? Leonard’s eyes widened immediately.

Pallez coughed slightly.

“‘Her’ state is very strange, not better than mine.

“In short, that organization that believes in The Fool is more—hmm, when making contact or cooperating with Klein Moretti, it’s best you be more careful.”

After saying that, the parasite fell silent without saying another word.

Leonard actually wants to use a mission to leave Backlund so as to avoid the threat from Amon? This is an idea the grandpa came up with? That’s way too cowardly, no? Klein scanned the letter he received and silently muttered.

He began seriously considering the idea of using the arms deal as an excuse to quickly leave Backlund for a period of time.
