Chapter 1036 “Expected” Development

“According to Mr. Door, the main difference between the second Blasphemy Slate and the first Blasphemy Slate isn’t that the latter has many unique Sequence names, but that the former had many additions. It was a secret the ancient sun god caught a glimpse of towards ‘His’ later years. Alright, as a true god, there’s no such thing as later years. I’m just using the human concept of the period from ‘His’ birth to fall, so that would be considered ‘His’ later years.

“In other words, the second Blasphemy Slate’s creator was the ancient sun god?”

“Towards this question, Mr. Door answered with almost certainty. ‘He’ told me that the ancient sun god’s fall resulted in the birth of the Blasphemy Slate.

“Does that mean that it’s considered a key relic of the ancient sun god?

“Then, who was the one who created the first Blasphemy Slate? The original Creator who truly created everything? And what were the additional pieces of knowledge that appeared on the second Blasphemy Slate?

“Mr. Door didn’t answer, only saying that it involves too many secrets. It cannot be explained in just a few words. If ‘He’ were to return to the real world, ‘He’ would be able to tell me in detail. Fôll0w current novÊls on n/o/(v)/3l/b((in).(co/m)

“Heh, do you think I’ll fall for it?

“As the Blasphemy Slate was mentioned, I recalled two questions that had been bothering me since a long time ago. What does it mean to be the trend of the times? Who defines the trend of the times?

“Mr. Door’s reaction was very odd. ‘He’ laughed for nearly twenty seconds before telling me, be careful of the ‘Spectator.’

“What has this got to do with my question?

“With ‘His’ reminder, I carefully recalled the contents of the second Blasphemy Slate and discovered an unusual problem. As a Beyonder of the Savant pathway, my memory is something I can be proud of due to my eidetic memory. However, I only recalled that Sequence o of the Spectator pathway is Visionary, but I have no impression of its ritual to become a god!

“I can clearly remember all the rituals for the other twenty-one pathways, but this is the only one where, not only do I lack an impression of, I have even subconsciously neglected it.

“I tried asking Mr. Door what the ritual is for becoming a god for the Spectator pathway.

“Mr. Door laughed and said with a teasing and leisurely tone, ‘didn’t you already say it?’

“This... The ritual for a Spectator to become a god is to make the development of the times to be in line with one’s expectations. Then, consume the potion for their advancement when it’s at a certain time node in that trend?

“I believe that’s the truth!

“Compared to ‘the times is part of the original Creator; only when the times develop according to a certain expectation can ‘He’ draw energy from it and revive,’ this seems more objective. Heh, I knew that among the founders of that ancient secret organization, there had to be someone with their plans apart from the zealots!

“On careful thought, this is really quite a terrifying matter. It’s fine when stuck in the Low- and Mid-Beyonder levels, but once someone is of a high standing, they might suffer an unknown and sudden destruction simply because their particular thoughts, ideas, or matters that they would like to push forward disagrees with a particular existence’s expectations...

“Be careful of the ‘Spectator’!

“I’m very curious how Mr. Door knows what’s on the second Blasphemy Slate, as well as the various rituals needed to become a god. ‘His’ answer was that ‘He’ had seen the complete second Blasphemy Slate, and with ‘Him’ were Solomon, Zaratul, Tudor, Trunsoest, Augustus, Einhorn, Sauron, Castiya, Zoroast, Stiano, Constantine, and company... These were families who reigned over all the Beyonders in the Fourth Epoch!”

The secrets contained in this diary page made Klein feel as though he was facing a Mythical Creature’s form, embroiling his mind in a storm of knowledge.

The Spectator’s ritual to become a god is to make the times develop according to one’s imagination? If that’s the case, Adam has been subconsciously preparing for this since the beginning of the Fourth Epoch... So the secret that King George III is hiding, and the possible developments, are in line with “His” expectations, to the point of “Him” giving a helping hand? Once the tide of the times come rushing in, with things not being capable of changing in short time spans, “He” will be able to become a god?

In that case, engaging in a deep investigation of the Great Smog is abnormally dangerous. Even if I’m currently a Blessed of the Goddess, having an official Beyonder’s background and being able to cooperate with angels anytime, my safety can’t be guaranteed. After all, the Goddess isn’t able to descend for quite some time... Amidst his thoughts, Klein suddenly had the intention of cowering back.

If this were in the past, he could relax after reporting the matter to the Church of Evernight and even leave Backlund for a vacation. But now, as a Blessed of the Goddess, he had already promised to seek out Hvin Rambis and Saintess of White Katarina, making it very difficult for him to escape.

It was truly a case of “you win some, you lose some.”

Furthermore, Klein didn’t know how Adam wished for the times to develop. If a Great Smog of Backlund happened again, he really had no way of extricating himself. There were people he cared about, and he yearned for peace.

At the very least, I have to know what the king’s secret is before deciding what to do... On the second Blasphemy Slate, apart from the Beyonder pathways and Sequence potion, what are the secrets it has? Klein retracted his gaze and made Roselle’s diary page vanish.

Then, he looked around with a calm expression and said with a smile, “You may begin.”

At this moment, Audrey didn’t hide her curiosity. She raised her hand slightly and asked, “Honorable Mr. Fool, is there any special meaning to the cross beside your hand?

“If the answer requires an equivalent exchange, you can directly make the request.”

Klein placed the Unshadowed Crucifix on the table precisely because he wanted the Tarot Club members to ask. He could then use this opportunity to inform Little Sun and The Hanged Man, who might have a chance of using the cross, of the news. After all, such matters were beneath Mr. Fool to expect him to raise them.

Therefore, he smiled at Miss Justice.

“This question is nothing.

“It’s something left behind by the sun god of ancient times.”

Sun god of ancient times... Ancient sun god? The Creator that the City of Silver believes in? T-this cross actually has such origins? A captain of the royal guards who’s just a Sequence 5 or 6 actually had a relic of the ancient sun god on him? Isn’t that too much a coincidence? Fors couldn’t believe her ears when she heard Mr. Fool’s answer.

At this moment, The Fool Klein mentioned in passing, “Its level isn’t too high, corresponding to an Unshadowed. It’s greatest use is to eliminate the mental corruption of Beyonder characteristics and help people who have consumed excessive potions to expel the excess characteristics. It will allow those who do not wish to remain in the mysterious world to return to normalcy.”

This power is rather fascinating... It’s no wonder Mr. World once asked me if given a chance, will I be willing to completely leave the mysterious world... Audrey felt that her curiosity was satisfied.

Strange... It really is an item that makes me uncomfortable... Emlyn made a judgment as he looked to the side at The Sun.

Derrick was surprised and delighted, having a feeling that he had his dream fulfilled.

His dream was to free all the residents of the City of Silver from the curse and return under the Sun, and not constantly suffer the madness, pain, and torture.

And if such a dream could be fulfilled by the relic inherited from the ancient sun god—the Creator who the City of Silver believed in-it would truly appear to be destiny and inevitable.

He spoke before The Hanged Man.

“Honorable Mr. Fool, can I find a way to trade for this item?”

“As long as you pay a sufficient price,” Klein said with a slight nod.

...Mr. Fool really is the best, the greatest! Derrick praised from the bottom of his heart.

As long as a sufficient price is paid... Alger gained inspiration from Miss Magician’s rental of the notebook and hurriedly asked, “Honorable Mr. Fool, is it possible to rent the cross for a day or a few hours for a fixed price?”

He currently didn’t have any plans on renting it. As his Wind-blessed potion had digested relatively quickly, he planned on considering the problem of purging the excess characteristic after he consumed the additional Ocean Songster potion.

“Yes,” The Fool Klein answered simply.

It can be rented? The Star Leonard had benefited quite significantly from borrowing Leymano’s Travels previously. After he heard Mr. Fool’s answer, he focused, seriously thinking if he had any need for the ancient sun god’s relic.

A few seconds later, he realized that he didn’t have such a need.

Not only was the Sun pathway good against wraiths and specters, the Evernight pathway was good at it too!

Furthermore, when he returned from Tingen to Backlund, he had already obtained four Flaring Sun Charms, planning to give half of them to Klein who had provided him the information, keeping the other half for himself.

As for purging the excessive Beyonder characteristics and leaving the mysterious world, he didn’t need it. He was about to hold the ritual to become a Spirit Warlock!

At this moment, Fors glanced at Xio and felt pangs of regret.

She wasn’t regretting them sacrificing the cross to Mr. Fool, but rather that she didn’t attempt to use her powers or Leymano’s Travels to “Record” the corresponding powers before sacrificing it.

Of course, this was mainly because she was rather timid. Without being able to use an Astrologer’s means to determine the cross’s uses and effects, she didn’t dare to rashly make attempts.

After all, I can still rent it from Mr. Fool in the future... She tried hard to cheer up.

Noticing no further requests, The Fool Klein retracted his grace, gesturing to the Tarot Club members to begin the transactions and discussions.

In fact, the Unshadowed Crucifix had someone who potentially needed it. It was the Fog Sea’s Strongest Hunter Anderson. This fellow had undergone various experiments after boarding the Golden Dream under Vice Admiral Iceberg’s arrangements, doing so in a bid to digest the alien object inside him. There was already a certain level of success, but it wasn’t enough to completely eliminate the latent problems.

Upon thinking of this, Klein silently mumbled, I’ll get Danitz to ask later...

At this moment, Audrey raised a request for a transaction.

“Ladies and gentlemen, which one of you has a Dreamcatcher’s heart, mind illusion crystal, or an adult mind dragon’s complete brain?”
