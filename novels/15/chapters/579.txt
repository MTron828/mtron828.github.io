Chapter 580: Wormtongue

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Klein slowly turned his head and shot a glance at Danitz.

The pirate with a bounty of 5,500 pounds immediately shut his mouth and clamped up. It was as though nothing had happened.

After confirming that Helene boarded the liner without issues, he turned around and walked to the side of the carriage. He pretended to casually ask, “Did you hear the conversation?”

“No, no. A little, just a little...” Danitz shook his head as he gave a hollow chuckle.

Klein nodded slightly and said, “You have to remember; otherwise, it’ll be easy for people to see through you.”

“See through... me?” Danitz raised his hand and pointed at his nose and said blankly.

Klein said without changing his expression, “She’s from the Sauron family. She has anti-tracking Beyonder abilities. Together with her ticks and behavior, it can be confirmed that she’s a Sequence 7 from the Hunter pathway, Pyromaniac. She’s very similar to you, and you’ll be able to do a good job acting as her.”

“Me? I won’t do! I won’t be able to disguise myself like her! I’ll be identified with just a look!” Danitz jumped in fright.

Klein held back his laughter and said in a deep voice, “I’ll lend you Creeping Hunger.”

“... No, no! I have no experience in such matters. I won’t be able to fool Vice Admiral Ailment’s subordinates!” Abnormally nervous and horrified, Danitz declined the mission.

To him, this was an extremely embarrassing and dogsh*t matter. Only a pervert or a madman would complete it without any qualms.

Klein nodded in agreement and said without an expression, “Indeed, you are rather stupid.”

Danitz forced a smile. “Yes, I’m very stupid.”

Klein didn’t say a word as he walked past Danitz and opened the door to the carriage.

Danitz followed him with his eyes when he suddenly saw Gehrman Sparrow’s hair turn red.

He blinked his dull eyes and saw the man’s facial contours turn soft and his eyes turning emerald-green. His lips turned thin as they pursed, making him look frail and insecure. He had a masculine beauty and looked identical to Helene who had just left.

“...” After watching Gehrman Sparrow enter the carriage, Danitz turned his head back as the corners of his mouth twitched.

He was silent for a few seconds before he muttered silently, What a madman. He changed into a woman without any hesitation!

I have to say that Helene looks pretty good when disguised as a man.

This Beyonder power sure is useful. If I can receive an item like that and figure out what Captain’s ideal type is, then I can make the corresponding changes and make her fall in love with me.

But in that case, would the person that she falls in love with still be me?

Danitz found himself pondering over philosophical questions until he heard a cough from the carriage behind him.

He snapped to his senses and drove the carriage away from the harbor. He planned on making a huge detour before circling back.

Inside the carriage, Klein wasn’t as calm as he appeared. Although Helene was in male clothes, allowing him to temporarily not bother about the most embarrassing parts, he still felt quite embarrassed to have his face change into a woman’s while squeezing out breasts. This left him feeling down and awkward.

Sigh, a Faceless’s change in appearance is very easy. The difficult part is apparently the mind. To act as a good Faceless, I’ll have to cross many mental blocks. If I don’t, then I’ll have to spend a great deal of time to act as a real person for many years. My identity has to be recognized by everyone as I fully immerse myself into that character until I almost treat it like it’s real... This is more challenging on my bottom line. It’s crazy and warped.

To speed up my progress, I have to overcome a certain number of obstacles.

Klein pulled out a suitcase from under the carriage’s seat. He rummaged for some cloth and clothes before replicating Helene’s disguise.

He could’ve gotten Danitz to act as Helene and borrow the mystical item with the Faceless Beyonder characteristic from Justice for a few days without a problem.

However, that meant that there was a high chance of Danitz facing Vice Admiral Ailment Tracy directly. Without the Clown’s powers, it was almost impossible for him to hide it from her, putting his life in extreme danger.

It was impossible for Klein to make others bear such huge risks for his own matters; therefore, he could only challenge himself and do it himself.

Soon, he looked identical to Helene. Under the black top hat was a handsome androgynous face with soft and pronounced contours. His emerald-green eyes looked as beautiful as gems.

He adjusted his build, making himself shorter by a few centimeters and narrowing his shoulder width. His frame shrank and he looked like he had lightened significantly.

His current appearance quickly surfaced in Klein’s mind with his Clown powers.

It’s still not bad. There’s not much to it... Perhaps it’s because I’m not in female clothes, so it doesn’t feel much different from turning into Gehrman Sparrow, Danitz, or someone else. I just look prettier and have some discomfort in my chest... If I look like that on Earth, I wouldn’t have needed to worry about not having a girlfriend, he mocked and consoled himself as he curled the corners of his mouth.

What looked like a normal action on Gehrman Sparrow now looked pitiful and sorry.

F**k ! Klein cursed silently as he quickly adjusted his state of mind. Bit by bit, he immersed himself into the state of true acting.

With the passage of time, he discovered that the resistance he had had lessened significantly. Following that, he felt relaxed and calm as though the potion had harmonized itself further.

And that meant that the speed of his digestion would speed up.

It really is useful... Klein said silently as he got up and took four steps counterclockwise. He went above the gray fog and once again confirmed the danger level of his upcoming operation.

After returning to the real world, he switched to using Helene’s voice and deliberately suppressed it.

“Head to Pier 6 at the harbor.”

Danitz didn’t find anything amiss, but he suddenly came to a realization after changing directions. He couldn’t help but tremble. It’s like the real person... I wouldn’t be able to distinguish him if the day comes where he transforms into Captain to fool me...

After a while, the carriage reentered the harbor and went to the liner which Helene was originally meant to board. But it didn’t truly approach it and had instead circled around to a nearby warehouse.

Danitz jumped off the carriage and knocked on the warehouse’s door, according to a prior agreed pattern.

Out came a group of dock workers who were clearly of native blood. Following that, they made way.

After confirming that there wasn’t anything amiss, the bald member of the Resistance, Kalat, came out on a wheelchair.

“Where is she?” he looked at Danitz as he asked.

Through Helene’s matter, Danitz had successfully established communications with the Resistance.

Danitz laughed mischievously.

“In the carriage. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“She’s been drugged with medicine that makes her lose her strength. Its effects will last another ten hours.

“Remember, I want 70% of the thousand-pound reward.”

Kalat raised his right arm and waved it. Immediately two thin members of the Resistance got onto the carriage.

“Boss, it’s that woman,” they soon poked their heads out and said in the tone of a local gang.

“Take her down. Our mission is to protect her,” Kalat emphasized again.

Helene, who was disguised as a male, was helped down from the carriage with two soldiers supporting her on either side of her

With his control as a Clown, Klein pretended to be weak in the knees as he staggered.

He was soon moved to a room among the Bayam populace. At the same time, Kalat instructed a local gang member, who believed in Sea God, to find Strongman Ozil and tell him that they had found the target. He was to bring 1,000 pounds in exchange for the woman. As for Danitz, he had returned to the inn to await the news.

At noon, Ozil replied saying that he couldn’t be sure if the person was the real deal and had planned on sending a person over to confirm things.

Kalat agreed to his request.

Closer to the evening, a figure appeared outside the house.

He was a man wearing pantaloons and a jacket. He was Loenese and was dressed in the style of a native. He had short brows, about half of the average person’s. His brown eyes were recessed, and his face looked cut.

Kalat pushed himself on a wheelchair and appeared by the door. After seeing the man, he said in a heavy voice, “Mithor King?”

“Should I be honored that you actually know me?” The man laughed.

He was originally a captain of one of the pirate ships under Vice Admiral Hurricane Qilangos. After Vice Admiral Ailment Tracy took over the crew, he took on the role as third mate of her flagship, the Black Death. His nickname was Wormtongue, with a bounty of 5,400 pounds.

Kalat didn’t reply as he wheeled himself to make way.

Mithor entered a nearby room after being led by a gang member. Inside, he saw Helene sitting by the bedside in a gentleman’s outfit. Her eyes were darting about and glaring at him. Her teeth bit down on her lip as she looked furious and fearful while having feelings of despair and obstinacy.

“It’s her alright. However, I can’t be certain because she’s wearing thick makeup. It’s hard to tell what a woman really looks like once they don thick makeup. Wipe her face clean for me. Hey, why didn’t you cuff her? Don’t you know she’s dangerous?” Mithor surveyed the area and took two steps back in a guarded manner.

“She’s been drugged. She doesn’t have much strength and hasn’t resisted. But since you asked...” Kalat lifted his chin to a Resistance soldier.

The soldier found a pair of cuffs and walked over. After pulling Klein’s hands back, he cuffed him.

Klein continued wearing mixed emotions like before, trying hard to act like he was struggling despite having a lack of strength.

Then, another gang member got some water and wiped his face with a rough towel.

Thankfully, most of the makeup in this era isn’t waterproof... Klein began changing his face’s contours as the towel covered his face.

Before long, Mithor saw Helene’s moist face. She looked extraordinarily frail and beautiful in this state. Her emerald-green eyes shot out with intense hatred and a look of perplexity.

Unfortunately, she’s Captain’s... Mithor’s throat moved.

As a man and a pirate, he often fantasized about Vice Admiral Ailment Tracy and red-haired Helene falling into his embrace at the same time, but of course, it was only his imagination.

The way he looks at me is disgusting... Klein nearly puked.

Although he knew that it was targeted at red-haired Helene and had nothing to do with him, he couldn’t help but feel goosebumps.

In that instant, he got to know the real him a little deeper. He knew what things he couldn’t accept at all.

“It really is her.” Mithor turned his head and said to Kalat, “This is your reward.”

He threw the tiny leather bag in his hand over to him.

Kalat did a brief inspection and threw it to his subordinate. He pondered for a second and said, “We still need your help.”

“No problem. Seek out Ozil when needed.” Mithor pointed to red-haired Helene in the room and asked, “I’ll take her away, right?”

“Yes.” Kalat made way once again.

Klein didn’t wish to be helped by Mithor as he pretended to have regained some of his mobility while stumbling out.

Mithor was afraid of Vice Admiral Ailment Tracy, so he could only hold her by her shoulder and lead her to the carriage parked outside.

The carriage left the city and came to a private harbor. Mithor led Klein, who was disguised as red-haired Helene, onto a fishing boat which had been long prepared. Under the cover of the night, they left Bayam.

After about an hour, they saw a ship docked under the shadow of an island’s cliff. Fluttering in the wind was a huge flag with white bones drawn on it.

Black Death!
