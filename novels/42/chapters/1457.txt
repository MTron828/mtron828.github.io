Chapter 1458 – My Name Is Little Sky!

At this moment, both Yang Ye and the white bears were staring at the ice casket without even blinking. It was especially so for the white bears; they didn’t even dare to breathe.

The lid rose slowly into the air, and it didn’t take long for a hand to emerge from within the casket.

The hand was very white like snow.

It didn’t take long for the hand to grab the edge of the casket, and then a woman slowly sat up within the casket.

She seemed around the age of 16 or 17. She wasn’t very beautiful, but she was extremely pleasing to the eye. Moreover, she made others feel very close to her. Just like this very moment. As soon as Yang Ye laid eyes on her, he felt that she was very close to him, like he’d seen an old friend.

Even Yang Ye was shocked by this absurd thought of his!

The woman sat in the casket and glanced at the surroundings while a trace of bewilderment filled her eyes. It didn’t take long for her to look at Yang Ye, “What is this place?”

Her voice was very soft and fine, and it sounded very comforting.

Yang Ye glanced at her and said, “The Ominous Territory.”

Even though she seemed completely harmless, Yang Ye didn’t dare act carelessly, and he was vigilant at all times. What a joke! How could someone in the Ominous Territory be ordinary? In any case, he hadn’t met a single ordinary person here.

“The Ominous Territory?” Her beautiful brows were pressed together, and she thought for a while before she asked again, “What’s the Ominous Territory?”

Has she lost her memory? Yang Ye sized her up and said, “I don’t know what it is. In any case, it’s called the Ominous Territory.”

She frowned and thought for a very long time, and then she shook her head, “I can’t recall anything. I think that I should have been sleeping for too long, and I forgot in my sleep.”

Yang Ye’s face darkened, What a thought! She slept until she forgot?!

Meanwhile, she floated out of the casket. She wore a white and blue dress. It was quite special because it seemed a little like a cloudy blue sky. Moreover, she gave Yang Ye an extremely strange feeling. Besides that unexplainable feeling of closeness, there was another indescribable feeling.

She started walking towards Yang Ye. Meanwhile, Eaglet and Big Blackie who were standing in front of Yang Ye had actually taken the initiative to move aside for her.

Yang Ye’s face grew even more solemn.

It didn’t take long for her to arrive in front of Yang Ye. She gazed at Yang Ye, blinked, and said, “The Laws of Space, the Laws of Speed, the Laws of Decay, the Laws of Darkness. Hmm? The Sword Domain as well.... Wow, you’ve actually comprehended the Sword Domain.”

Yang Ye took a deep and long glance at her, How... terrifying. She was actually able to see through everything I’ve comprehended. How did she accomplish that?

Suddenly, she got close to Yang Ye, sniffed lightly, and then frowned. A short while passed before she shook her head, “Quasi Returnal Rank slaughter intent.... You’ve killed too much and have become entangled with too much karma. Even though it has allowed you to possess formidable strength, the greater the slaughter, the greater the bad karma you possess. You’ll suffer retribution.”

“Retribution?” Yang Ye shook his head, “It’s fine so long as my conscience is clear after I kill them. I don’t care about any retribution, nor do I fear it.”

She blinked. Suddenly, she stretched out her hand and tapped Yang Ye’s chest. But it didn’t take long for her to withdraw her hand, “So that’s why. The Heart of Slaughter.” She paused for a moment and continued, “Slaughter will only give birth to even more slaughter. Endless slaughter.”

“Then I’ll kill until the end!” Yang Ye continued, “I’ll kill until no one dares to look for trouble with me.”

She gazed at him for a long time before she said, “Have you heard of rebirth?”

Yang Ye replied, “I hadn’t in the past. However, I encountered a senior before this, so I heard a little about it!”

She nodded, “If a person dies, the person will enter the cycle of reincarnation. However, you’ve killed too much, so it’s very difficult for you to enter the cycle of reincarnation. Even if you don’t enter it, you’ll still suffer a terrible fate. Because those people who you killed in the past will come for you. The more you kill, the more will come for you. Of course, perhaps they have already been reborn. But everything in this world is within the cycle of karma. So, they will still come for you, one way or the other.”

Yang Ye shook his head and said, “I believe in karma, but I believe even more in strength. If one possesses powerful strength, then all karma will be nothing.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he chuckled, “Let’s not talk about that. You feel very close to me, but we don’t know each other. I’m quite curious about you. Right, who are you? What are you doing here?”

For some unknown reason, his intuition told him that she wouldn’t harm him. So, just like Big Blackie and the others, his vigilance towards her was gradually vanishing.

“My name?” She blinked and thought for a long time before she shook her head, “I’ve forgotten it.”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

Meanwhile, she added, “But you can call me Little Sky. It’s because I like the blue sky.”

Little Sky! Yang Ye sized her up. She didn’t look like she was lying, and she had probably really lost her memories. Who is she? What is she doing here? Why was she able to see through me?

There were many questions in Yang Ye’s mind, but he was clearly unable to obtain any answers.

Yang Ye didn’t allow himself to linger on the questions. He thought for a moment and said, “I’m heading to the Forest of Darkness, but these white bears refuse to let me pass. However, they seem to fear you. Can you make them leave and let me pass?”

Little Sky looked at the white bears when she heard him. As soon as she did that, Yang Ye watched with astonishment as the white bears suddenly laid down flat on the ground. Even the leader of the white bears did the same.

Yang Ye glanced at her, and he grew even more curious about her identity.

Little Sky frowned as she gazed at the bears, and she seemed to be thinking. A long time passed before she shook her head, “No matter what, thank you for protecting me throughout these years. Now that I’ve awoken, you’re all free.”

The body of their leader suddenly trembled when it heard Little Sky. It seemed to be excited. It suddenly crawled over to Little Sky, and then it just laid there on the ground in front of her.

Yang Ye was visibly moved because it was obviously a sign of submission. The white bear was actually willing to submit to her, and it was done so willingly!

However, Little Sky shook her head. She stretched out her hand to stroke the white bear’s fur, “The heavens gave birth to all things, and all things are equal. Go see out your own path.”

The white bear glanced at her, and Yang Ye noticed a trace of disappointment in its eyes. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

The white bear laid there for a while, and then it turned around and vanished into the distance with the other white bears.

Once they left, Yang Ye heaved a sigh of relief and looked at Little Sky, “They are very strong.”

“They should have freedom!” Little Sky spoke softly, and then she gazed at Big Blackie and the others, “All of them as well.”

Big Blackie and the others remained silent, and then they gazed at Yang Ye.

Yang Ye remained silent for a long time, and then he said, “Five years, stay with me for five years. I’ll return your freedom to you after that.”

He knew that no matter who it was, no one wanted to have their freedom restrained forever. So, he had to give them hope, hope to be free. Five years weren’t long to them. After all, some demon beasts slept for a few dozen years.

Big Blackie and the others immediately revealed expressions of gratitude when they heard him. Actually, they weren’t very hopeful, but they hadn’t expected Yang Ye to actually agree. Five years really weren’t long for them. However, whether they could live for five years was a huge challenge while they stayed by Yang Ye’s side!

Moreover, to be honest, they didn’t really want to leave. Because the spirit energy within the Primordial Pagoda was too pure.

In short, they weren’t very against staying with Yang Ye anymore. Of course, it was better if they could gain their freedom.

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings, and then he gazed at Little Sky, “Miss Little Sky, I have other matters to attend to, so I’ll be bidding my farewells.”

Little Sky smiled, “Let’s go together!”

“Huh?” Yang Ye was stunned.

She added, “Let’s go together!”

Yang Ye gulped, “You... you want to go with me?”

She nodded, “I’ve lost my memories, so I don’t know who I am. You’re the first person I’ve met, so I’m naturally going with you.”

Yang Ye glanced at her and said, “Miss Little Sky, I’m going to a very dangerous place. It’s extremely dangerous. So, it’s best if you don’t come.”

He naturally didn’t dare to let her come with him. Her background was unknown, and she was very mysterious. If he let her come, then he wouldn’t be able to rest at ease. Even though he felt very close to her, and she felt very kind, it was exactly why he couldn’t rest at ease. Because it was too strange.

She replied, “But isn’t leaving me here even more dangerous for me?”

Yang Ye said, “Miss Little Sky, you must be joking. Not to mention this place, your strength is probably sufficient to head to the other side of Yellow Springs River.”

Even though he couldn’t discern her strength, he had no doubt that she was definitely very strong. Otherwise, it would have been impossible for her to see through his ability.

“Strength?” She shook her head, “I don’t know how to fight!”

“You don’t?” Yang Ye was stunned, “What are you trying to say?”

She replied, “I don’t know how to fight!”

Yang Ye felt speechless.

Meanwhile, she added, “Just let me stay with you, alright? I’ll leave once I regain my memories, alright?”

Yang Ye hurriedly shook his head, “No, absolutely not. Miss Little Sky, I’m not joking. I’m leaving.”

Yang Ye’s figure flashed onto Big Blackie once he finished speaking. The latter glanced at Little Sky, and then it transformed into a ray of dark light that vanished into the distance.

Little Blackie and Eaglet hurriedly followed after them.

Yang Ye heaved a sigh of relief after some time passed. Right when he thought that they’d left her behind, Big Blackie suddenly stopped. Because a person had appeared not too far ahead of them, and it was none other than Little Sky!

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

She grinned and said, “While I don’t know how to fight, I’m very fast when it comes to running!”

Yang Ye gazed at her for a long time before he said, “What exactly do you want?!”

She replied, “I want to go in!”

Yang Ye frowned, “In? In where?”

Little Sky suddenly floated over to Yang Ye, and then she pointed at his chest and grinned, “That world inside your body....”

The Primordial Pagoda!

Yang Ye’s hairs stood on end!

She actually knows about the world within me?! She can detect the Primordial Pagoda?!
