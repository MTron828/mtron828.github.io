Chapter 1659 - You Know The Unfettered One?

Translator: InVader

Needless to say, Yang Ye was quite anxious.

The Primordial Pagoda always seized good treasures it saw. If it was at any other time, then he would wish for nothing more than to see it do that. However, it couldn’t take the Soul Nurturing Tree right now! If it did that, he would definitely be attacked and killed by the experts of the Ku Clan!

The tiny vortex was still spinning. Yang Ye clenched his fists while cold sweat gradually started flowing from him. At this moment, he was prepared to run at a moment’s notice.

Around five breaths of time later, the tiny vortex slowly stopped.

Yang Ye heaved a sigh of relief. Looks like it knows how to judge the severity of the situation!

Suddenly, Ku Zhuyi said, “What’s wrong?”

He wiped off the cold sweat on his forehead and shook his head, “It’s nothing. I just feel a little weak!”

She glanced indifferently at him, “You wouldn’t feel that way if you stop doing things like that.”

“What?!” Yang Ye turned to look at her. He sized her up and said, “I didn’t realize you were so dirty!”

She didn’t answer him and just gazed at the Soul Nurturing Tree.

Meanwhile, Ku Rong turned to look at Yang Ye and the others, “This is my Ku Clan’s Soul Nurturing Tree. Which one of you intends to go first?”

“I will!” Mo Lin spoke abruptly, and then he flashed over to the platform.

A moment of silence ensued, and then a strand of dark green energy surged out from within him, and everyone here immediately felt a strong aura of life.

Meanwhile, Ku Rong spoke softly, “A mutated form of wood element profound energy!”

Yang Ye gazed at Ku Rong with a puzzled expression on his face, “A mutated form of wood element profound energy?”

Ku Rong nodded slightly, “There are all sorts of profound energy in the world, like five element profound energy, and various others. He possesses wood element profound energy, but it isn’t ordinary. I presume he obtained some sort of fortuitous encounter in the past, and it made his wood element profound energy mutate.”

Yang Ye asked, “What can it do?”

Ku Rong said, “People with such profound energy possess extremely strong self-healing capabilities. Moreover, it can extend their lifespan. But the Soul Nurturing Tree…” When he spoke up to this point, he gazed at Mo Lin, “I hope a miracle happens.”

On the platform, the pure dark green energy was surging towards the Soul Nurturing Tree. It didn’t take long for it to be completely absorbed by the tree, and then the tree started to tremble slightly.

Ku Rong slowly clenched his fists when he witnessed this scene.

More and more dark green energy surged out from within Mo Lin. At this point, the entire tree was entirely enveloped by the energy, and then the withered roots of the Soul Nurturing Tree seemed to be undergoing a change.

Ku Rong and Ku Zhuyi became excited when they witnessed this.

The Soul Nurturing Tree was of utmost importance to the Ku Clan!

Time trickly by. In the blink of an eye, an hour had passed. At this moment, Ku Rong and Ku Zhuyi’s faces were gloomy. Because even though the tree had absorbed all that dark green energy, it hadn’t really undergone any changes.

Just like that, another hour passed. Mo Lin suddenly stopped at this moment because all his profound energy had been exhausted.

Mo Lin stood silently on the spot for a long time, and then he went back to Ku Rong’s side. After that, he gazed at Yang Ye, “Didn’t you say that you can treat it? Go on!”

Yang Ye was about to speak when the violet robed middle aged man, who’s been silent until now, spoke abruptly, “Let me try!”

Everyone immediately gazed at him when they heard him speak.

Ku Rong glanced at him and said, “Brother Ning, are you confident?”

The middle aged man grinned, “I’m not confident at all. But I can try.”

Ku Rong nodded, “Please go ahead!”

The middle aged man nodded slightly, and then he appeared on the round platform. He walked slowly towards the Soul Nurturing Tree, and then he gazed at it in silence for a long time before suddenly stretching his hand forward slowly.

When the middle aged man’s hand was about to touch the tree, a cold glow suddenly flashed through his eyes, and then he waved his right hand. The Soul Nurturing Tree instantly vanished on the spot, and then he stomped his right foot down and transformed into a violet pillar of light that shot up into the sky.

Yang Ye was stunned by this scene.

He’s trying to steal it! Someone is actually braver than me!

Meanwhile, Ku Rong and Ku Zhuyi’s faces turned gloomy when they saw the middle aged man grab the Soul Nurturing Tree. At the same time, Ku Rong vanished on the spot, and he was behind the middle aged man when his figure appeared once more.

However, a terrifying aura suddenly erupted from within the middle aged man, and it blasted Ku Rong back to where he’d come from!

A True Realm expert!

The expressions of everyone here had changed. No one had expected that the middle aged man was actually a True Realm expert!

Ku Rong’s face was extremely unsightly. He clearly hadn’t imagined that the middle aged man would have concealed his strength, and this had taken Ku Rong by surprise.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye was about to shoot off in pursuit. After all, the Soul Nurturing Tree was the only way to save Little Sky, and he didn’t want to just give up on it.

However, Ku Zhuyi stopped him, “Do you want to die? That’s a True Realm expert!”

Yang Ye shook his head, “It doesn’t matter!”

As he spoke, he was about to flash off in pursuit, but Ku Zhuyi grabbed his arm and said, “It’s my Ku Clan’s business. We’ll deal with it ourselves!”

Yang Ye was just about to speak when numerous explosions resounded in the distant sky. But it didn’t take long for the explosions to vanish. Around a few breaths of time later, a one-armed man suddenly walked out from a point in space that wasn’t too far away from them.

The one-armed man seemed to be around the age of 40. His hair was brownish yellow, and he wore a linen robe and a pair of simple straw slippers. He was holding a middle aged man in his left hand, and that middle aged man was the same True Realm expert who had fled with the Soul Nurturing Tree just now!

Yang Ye took a deep and long glance at the one-armed man. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Strong!

Extremely strong!

True Realm experts weren’t Zenith Realm experts. Those who attained the True Realm were definitely not ordinary, and it was absolutely difficult to kill another True Realm expert in a battle between two True Realm experts. However, the one-armed man had actually used such a short amount of time to kill the middle aged man! So, it was obvious how strong the one-armed man was!

Meanwhile, Ku Zhuyi and Ku Rong bowed respectfully to the one-armed man, and there was undisguised reverence on their faces.

The one-armed man casually tossed the middle aged man over to Ku Rong, and then he turned around and walked away. However, he’d suddenly stopped after taking two steps and turned to gaze at Yang Ye, “A sword cultivator?”

Yang Ye glanced at the one-armed man and nodded, “Yes!”

The one-armed man gazed at Yang Ye for a short while and said, “I sense a familiar aura from you. You’re from Merak System?”

A wisp of surprise flashed through Yang Ye’s eyes, “How did you know?”

The one-armed man fell silent for a short while and said, “You’re not bad.” His figure vanished on the spot once he finished speaking.

Suddenly, Ku Zhuyi asked, “You’re from Merak System?”

Yang Ye gazed at her and nodded.

She glanced at him and didn’t say another word.

Yang Ye asked, “Who was that? He’s strong!”

Ku Zhuyi spoke indifferently, “Ku Ming, my seventh uncle. He was once ranked second on the Milky Way Rankings. Moreover, he killed a True Realm expert while at the Half-Step True Realm. He’s the guardian of my Ku Clan now!”

“The Milky Way Rankings?” Yang Ye frowned, “What’s that?”

Ku Zhuyi replied, “You just returned to the Yang Clan from Merak System?”

Yang Ye nodded, “I don’t know much about the Milky Way System.”

She glanced at him and explained, “The Milky Way Rankings is a ranking in our medium universe, and only the most outstanding geniuses of our medium universe are ranked on it.” She paused for a moment and continued, “I’m currently ranked at the 19th position!”

Yang Ye was astounded, “Only the 19th?”

Ku Zhuyi glared angrily at him when she heard him, and she clenched her fists as if she was about to attack him.

Meanwhile, Ku Rong suddenly said, “Young Brother, the 19th position is extremely amazing. There are thousands upon thousands of geniuses in the medium universe of Milky Way System. Especially the eight clans. Which one of their young masters and young misses are ordinary? Besides the eight clans, there are many other geniuses. So, just think about it. Isn’t it very difficult to be ranked at the 19th amongst so many people?”

Yang Ye laughed bitterly, and then he gazed at Ku Zhuyi who was still angry, “I didn’t mean it that way. I meant that you’re so strong yet you’re only the 19th. So, the rankings are quite terrifying!”

Ku Zhuyi’s face eased up slightly, and she said, “It’s much more terrifying than you can imagine. Those in the top ten are at the Zenith Realm at least. Moreover, only those below the age of 40 are ranked on it!”

Yang Ye nodded. It isn’t just any ordinary rankings!

Even he didn’t dare to look down on Ku Zhuyi’s sword soul technique, but she was only 19th on the rankings. Moreover, those in the top ten were Zenith Realm experts who were below the age of 40. Even the word monstrous genius wasn’t sufficient to describe them!

Meanwhile, Ku Zhuyi suddenly said, “Since you’re from Merak System, I’m curious if you know a person.”

Yang Ye asked, “Who?”

She replied, “The Unfettered One!”

“What?” Yang Ye almost leaped up with surprise, “You… you know the Unfettered One? He has been to Milky Way System?”

She glanced at him and said, “Looks like you do know him.”

Yang Ye gulped, “How do you know him?”

Ku Zhuyi shook her head slightly, “I don’t. I’ve only heard about him. Because he was the one who chopped off my seventh uncle’s arm!”

Yang Ye was stunned speechless.

Ku Zhuyi continued, “My seventh uncle used to be extremely arrogant. When he met that fellow called the Unfettered One, he said he would let the Unfettered One launch three attacks before he counterattacked…”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.
