Chapter 2701 – The Yang Clan!

The Good Sprite!

As the ancient Yang Clan, how could they not know about the sprite of goodness in this world?

The three of them exchanged glances.

This time, they were clearly shocked!

Yang Ye glanced at them and remained silent.

He’d revealed what should be revealed!

Now, it was time to wait for the outcome.

A short while later, the old man spoke solemnly, “Can you wait for a moment? We have to discuss something!”

Yang Ye smiled, “Of course!”

The old man nodded slightly, “Please come inside and have a seat.”

Yang Ye shook his head, “I’ll just wait here. I’ll be leaving in two hours.”

The old man glanced at Yang Ye, and then they left without saying a word.

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings, grinned, and then gazed at Snowy. Snowy gazed at him too. She cracked a smile and rubbed her head against his chin.

Yang Ye rubbed Snowy’s head, and then he sat down cross-legged. He withdrew the sword chest he’d received from the Martial Sky Race, and there were five swords within it!

He still hadn’t used the sword chest and five swords until now, so he wasn’t very sure how strong they were.

However, they shouldn’t be weak!

If they were weak, the ancestor of the Martial Sky Clan wouldn’t have used it against Destiny. While that ancestor of theirs had failed, it was enough to prove that these swords and the sword chest weren’t ordinary!

Yang Ye was about to try them when the old man’s group appeared before him again.

Yang Ye gazed at them, and the old man spoke solemnly, “We can work together with you, but we have two requests!”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and replied, “Tell me about it!”

The old man replied, “Firstly, you must join our clan!”

Yang Ye frowned. Join the Yang Clan? What the heck?

The old man spoke indifferently, “Is that a no?”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and said, “I think I should warn you that having me in the Yang Clan may not be a good thing.”

The old man nodded, “I know.”

Yang Ye smiled, “I don’t like to beat around the bush, so just tell me everything!”

The old man fell silent for a long time and sighed softly, “I’m sure you’ve noticed the situation that the Yang Clan is in right now. Patriarch and that form of Destiny are gone, and the loss of our patriarch caused our clan to… Sigh… At this point, the Yang Clan is half dead.”

He gazed at Yang Ye.

Yang Ye asked, “You want me to revive the Yang Clan?”

The old man hesitated for a moment and shook his head, “No, that isn’t your responsibility. While you have my Yang Clan’s bloodline, I know that the responsibility of reviving the Yang Clan shouldn’t be left to you.”

Yang Ye said, “Let me guess, you want me to join the Yang Clan so that I’m bound to it, and we both rise and fall together, right?”

The old man nodded.

Yang Ye fell silent for a short while and asked, “What about the second request?”

The old man replied, “If you can, please ask the owner of Heaven Executor if our ancestor is dead or alive.”

Yang Ye nodded, “Alright!”

He glanced at them, “There’s something I must make clear. Since we’re starting to work together, or you can even call it an alliance, I hope we don’t scheme against each other. I really hate things like that.”

The old man nodded, “Of course.”

Yang Ye continued, “Besides that, it’s the last time I’m going to remind you, but my enemies are very strong.”

The old man grinned, “Destiny is very strong too!”

Yang Ye glanced at them and said, “I’ll let you know if I need anything.”

He turned around and left.

However, Yang Ye patted Snowy at the entrance, and Snowy understood what he meant. She withdrew the Sprite Staff. In an instant, the entire city was covered in her Sprite Domain, and then spirit energy rapidly increased here at a visible rate.

The old man and the others were extremely shocked by this sight.

Only the Good Sprite was capable of doing something like this!

She was forcibly extending the life of this world!

An hour later, Snowy stopped, and Yang Ye rubbed her head before looking at the old man, “I must ask, how many Destiny Realm experts does the Yang Clan have right now? Are they all at the peak?”

The old man nodded slightly, “All three of us are at the Destiny Realm, and besides us, there is one more who is stronger than us.”

He glanced at Yang Ye, “I too must ask, if we go outside, Destiny won’t hunt us?”

Destiny!

Actually, it was mainly Destiny that had trapped the remnants of the Yang Clan here!

In the past, the experts of the End World couldn’t come into the outside world, and it was the same for them!

Yang Ye nodded, “They won’t.”

The old man nodded, “That’s good. We can establish contact with the outside world now.”

Yang Ye didn’t say anything and just left with Snowy.

Once he left, the woman suddenly said, “He’s quite sly and doesn’t seem very trustworthy!”

The old man spoke softly, “My intuition tells me that everything in the Three Dimensional Universe will change after this, and whether we can truly rise up depends on it.”

The woman spoke solemnly, “His enemies…”

The old man smiled, “Would you choose Destiny or them? Even though many of them are old geezers from countless years ago!”

The woman shook her head, “It’s because Destiny is too strong that I’m worried. Those old geezers know how strong she is, but they still dare to target her. That’s very unusual.”

The old man nodded, “I know.”

He looked up at the sky and continued, “Even someone as strong as our ancestor couldn’t kill Destiny, so what reason do we have to not choose Destiny’s side?”

The others fell silent.

Once he left the Yang Clan, Yang Ye used Great Unknown to teleport to Darkspace.

He hadn’t forgotten someone.

The Dark Lord!

He didn’t know how strong the Dark Lord was, but he wanted to try his luck!

As soon as he arrived there, the Dark Lord appeared before him.

Yang Ye said, “You know why I’m here?”

The Dark Lord replied, “They’ve already been here!”

Yang Ye laughed bitterly, “Guess I’m going back empty-handed.”

The Dark Lord fell silent for a short while and said, “I refused them, and I will refuse you.”

Yang Ye nodded, “I won’t force you.”

The Dark Lord spoke softly, “Darkspace is unlike the outside world. Of course, Darkspace can’t afford to offend any of you. Heng Wangu agreed that so long as I don’t interfere in the enmity between both of you, the End World will never act against Darkspace.”

Yang Ye smiled, “It’s the same for me. And you’ve helped me in the past. So, if you need something, I won’t refuse if it’s within the scope of my ability!”

The Dark Lord nodded, “Thank you.”

The small kindness from before had paid off.

Because she was very well aware that Darkspace would definitely seek Yang Ye’s help in the future.

After all, Yang Ye had Snowy!

Yang Ye left Darkspace. While he failed to obtain the Dark Lord’s help, he wasn’t disappointed.

As always, he attached most importance to himself.

People always had to rely on themselves!

If he wasn’t strong enough, everything else would be meaningless. Even those forms of Destiny and Qi Bitian weren’t people he’d entrusted his hopes to.

Of course, he was different now too.

At the very least, he’d learned to get help in battle.

Of course, the main reason was that he was no match for them and had no other choice...

Once he left Darkspace, Yang Ye used Great Unknown to teleport to the Destiny Dimension that the woman in black lived in!

He actually couldn’t come here, but those restrictions vanished once he had Great Unknown. Moreover, since she’d given him her sword, it was equivalent to acknowledging him.

He'd come here mainly because this place was temporarily safe!

As soon as he arrived here, Snowy dashed out with the Sprite Staff, and then a herd of cows and sheep charged over toward her.Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Snowy’s face was covered in excitement. She immediately flew over to the back of the sheeps’ leader, and then she touched its horn lightly with her staff. The sheep understood what she meant and charged off into the distance…

Yang Ye shook his head and smiled as he watched Snowy play.

Yang Ye went over to the woman in black’s wooden house, and a hexagonal formation immediately appeared below him. Countless strands of Polaris Energy appeared around him and surged incessantly into him!

Yang Ye sat down cross-legged and withdrew the pitch black sword chest of unknown make. Yang Ye withdrew the five swords. They formed a complete sword formation with the sword chest!

The Five Element Sword Formation!

If they were merged, they could change the energy of the five elements in the surroundings… However, doing that was quite crazy. After all, Snowy had almost killed everyone when she did it that day.

Besides that, he had the armor he was wearing. He rarely used it as well. It was because he wanted to preserve that feeling of being in danger, and he didn’t want to overly rely on it. Of course, it didn’t mean that he wouldn’t use it!

The armor could save his life at the critical moment!

Besides that, he had the Sword Gourd, Great Unknown, and Past Life!

Of course, he had the Past Life Energy!

They were all his trump cards!

His greatest trump card was the Sword Domain!

Yang Ye left the wooden house a while later.

Training with the sword!

Yang Ye started training slowly before the wooden house. He just trained with ordinary moves that were completely normal and calm.

But every one of them carried the Domain Sword!

As he trained and trained, something unexpected happened. The five swords in the wooden house suddenly arrived around him, and then lined up in a row to his right. Every single time Yang Ye swung his sword, those five swords would make the same movement…
