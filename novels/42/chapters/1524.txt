Chapter 1525 - A Treasure Within The Pagoda!

Translator: InVader

Yang Ye wasn’t much slower. As soon as Qiong Qi fled, he swiftly entered Heaven’s Door as well. Just like that, they vanished before the black robed old man’s group.

They’d fled!

They’d fled again!

The black robed old man’s face was extremely unsightly.

Yang Ye could fight and flee at will, and it simply seemed like he’d taken this place to be like his own home.

Meanwhile, the old man in a grey robe suddenly gazed at the black robed old man, “Brother Mu You, Brother Su Yu, why don’t we… head down there?”

The black robed old man, Mu You, and the other old man in luxurious robes, Su Yu, who’d just arrived, gazed at the grey robed old man. A moment of silence ensued before Mu You shook his head, “The Nether Pavilion!”

The Nether Pavilion!

Their expressions changed slightly when they heard this. The threat Yang Ye posed was in the future. After all, he was only a Semi-Deity right now. No matter how extraordinary Yang Ye’s strength was right now, he was still a Semi-Deity right now. So, it was impossible for Yang Ye to shake the foundation of their sects. Just like this very moment, Yang Ye could only flee before them.

However, the Nether Pavilion was different. The Nether Pavilion wasn’t a future threat but a current one. Not to mention all its hall masters, just Blood Maiden could shake the foundation of their sects!

It could be said that if they weren’t afraid of the Nether Pavilion, they would have gone down there and killed Yang Ye a long time ago.

The grey robed old man spoke in a low voice, “But are we just going to let him come and go as he pleases?”

Su Yu nodded, “Allowing this to continue won’t do too. Even though my arrival has made them dare not come here for some time, we can’t just stay here forever. We must think of a way to resolve this. Otherwise, we’ll be forced to stay here forever.”

The grey robed old man nodded, “Most importantly, don’t forget that while they can’t defeat us and dare not come here for now, what if Yang Ye attains the Deity Realm?”

Su Yu and Mu You’s expressions became serious when they heard the grey robed old man. They’d almost forgotten that Yang Ye was at the Semi-Deity Realm, but his strength was so terrifying. If he attained the Deity Realm, then would the three of them really be able to stop him?

The grey robed old man added, “Even though no Semi-Deity seems to have ever been able to kill Rebirth Realm experts, I’m sure you’ve heard of many Deities who’ve killed Rebirth Realm experts, right?”

They naturally had!

Even Rebirth Realm experts wouldn’t dare go head-on against the Unfettered One and Jian Wuji while they were just Deities all those years ago.

Many people in this world couldn’t be judged by convention. For example, Jian Wuji, the Unfettered One, and Yang Ye!

Silence filled the area.

All of them were in a dilemma.

They couldn’t head down there, but if they didn’t, they couldn’t just stay here everyday as well. Moreover, they were afraid that Yang Ye would charge into the Deity Realm. If Yang Ye really attained the Deity Realm, then they would be in trouble!

They remained silent for a long time. In the end, they exchanged glances and nodded. They seemed to have made some sort of decision.

…

In the lower dimensions.

Once Yang Ye and Qiong Qi fled back down to the lower dimensions, Yang Ye did as he always did. He shot underground and entered the Primordial Pagoda to recover. Yang Ye noticed that the pain from the backlash of his sword intent seemed to have lessened tremendously. In the past, it was simply worse than death. Yet now, while it still hurt terribly, it didn’t feel that bad anymore.

In the end, he realized that he’d gotten used to it. After frequently suffering backlash from his sword intent, Yang Ye had gotten used to the pain. It was a good thing for him.

A long time passed before Yang Ye recovered completely with the help of the Primordial Pagoda.

In the outside world, Yang Ye gazed at Qiong Qi who remained on the surface and was healing.

Yang Ye shook his head and said, “Brother, you’ll recover very quickly if you heal in my pagoda.” He’d invited Qiong Qi into the pagoda just now, but Qiong Qi refused no matter what. He was very puzzled by that. Because the Primordial Pagoda held no ill intent towards Qiong Qi, but Qiong Qi was adamant on refusing.

Qiong Qi opened his eyes and shook his head.

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Why?”

Qiong Qi remained silent for a moment, and then he replied, “Do you know why that pagoda of yours is so deterring to demon beasts?”

Yang Ye shook his head. He was very curious about that as well.

Qiong Qi continued, “Your pagoda is a precious treasure. No, strictly speaking, it isn’t a treasure anymore.”

“It isn’t?” Yang Ye frowned, “Then what level is it at?”

“What level?” Qiong Qi glanced at Yang Ye and said, “I don’t know. Because I merely heard of it in the past, and I never laid eyes on it.”

Yang Ye felt speechless.

Qiong Qi added, “Even though it’s extremely powerful, it doesn’t possess the ability to deter demon beasts. Its abilities aren’t targeted at demon beasts either. It’s actually another treasure within that pagoda of yours which is deterring to demon beasts!”

“Another treasure?” Yang Ye was stunned, “There’s another treasure in there? Why don’t I know about it?”

Qiong Qi replied, “I wasn’t very sure in the past. But once I went in there, I sensed its aura. I’ve seen it in the past, and I’ll never forget its aura. I just don’t understand what it’s doing inside that pagoda of yours. Moreover, it seems to be unable to show itself!”

There’s another treasure within the pagoda! Yang Ye was quite excited. He gazed at Qiong Qi and asked, “So, did you get beaten up by that treasure in the past?”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye knew that he’d made a mistake. Sure enough, Qiong Qi exploded with rage, “What fucking nonsense! I was invincible throughout the world! How could I have possibly been…” He seemed to be afraid of something when he spoke up to this point, and he paused for a moment before his tone eased up as well, “I’ve just seen it in the past! I haven’t fought it!”

Yang Ye glanced at Qiong Qi. Obviously, Qiong Qi had suffered because of that treasure. Otherwise, that fellow wouldn’t insist on staying out of the Primordial Pagoda! But exactly what could even do that to him?

Yang Ye asked, “What treasure is that?”

Qiong Qi remained silent for a short while and said, “It’s a treasure that a bastard created just to deal with demon beasts. It was made specially for demon beasts, and it can be considered as the bane of all demon beasts. Of course, it isn’t absolute. I don’t know about other universes, but my universe really doesn’t have more than ten demon beasts that can resist that thing!”

Yang Ye hurriedly asked, “What’s its name?”

Qiong Qi glanced at Yang Ye, “Why ask so much? It’s in that pagoda of yours, so it’ll appear before you, sooner or later. You’ll know when the time comes!”

Yang Ye puckered his lips. That fellow is trying to keep me guessing…

However, Qiong Qi was right. It was definitely within the Primordial Pagoda, and perhaps it was in the 4th level!

The 4th level!

Yang Ye wanted to open it, but it couldn’t be opened just because he wanted to. Every single level of the Primordial Pagoda would open on its own when his strength arrived at a certain level. However, he didn’t know exactly how strong he had to be in order to make the Primordial Pagoda give him access to the 4th level. Even though it worked with him at most times, it refused to communicate with him, and that was one of the most depressing things about it!

Meanwhile, Qiong Qi suddenly asked, “Kid, do you have to go to that large world?”

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts and replied, “I have to!”

Qiong Qi pondered deeply for a while and said, “It’s a little difficult.”

Yang Ye smiled, “I know. So, I intend to fight a battle of attrition. If I fail a day, I’ll do it for a year; if I fail for a year, then I’ll go on for two years. I’ll continue until I can fight my way up there!”

Qiong Qi shook his head, “That’s a good way to think. However, wouldn’t they allow you to exhaust them like that? They’re all old fellows, so they’re definitely intelligent. So, they’ll either make a compromise and let you go up there, or they’ll think of a way to annihilate you and give you no further chances.”

Yang Ye nodded. He naturally understood that. Those fellows from the large world weren’t fools, so they definitely knew what he was thinking. Otherwise, three Rebirth Realm experts wouldn’t have come there. Yet now, Qiong Qi’s presence may make the large world send even more Rebirth Realm experts to deal with them!

Qiong Qi said, “Kid, in my opinion, it’s best for you to cultivate down here and attain the Deity Realm before going up there. At that time, those old fellows will probably be incapable of stopping you.”

Yang Ye shook his head, “They won’t give me the chance to attain the Deity Realm. If I don’t go up there now, then the battlefield might be moved down here instead. Even though they are afraid of the Nether Pavilion and dare not come down here, I guarantee that once I’m breaking through to the Deity Realm, they’ll definitely stop at nothing to kill me!”

“That’s true!” Qiong Qi nodded. Yang Ye’s natural talent was too great. If he was allowed to attain the Deity Realm, then his strength would undergo another transformation. At that time, with the Stellar Sword Diagram in his possession, even Rebirth Realm experts would have to avoid him!

Yang Ye added, “Besides that, it’s definitely impossible to attain the Deity Realm in a short amount of time. I can’t wait that long!”

If Snowy and Zi’er hadn’t been captured by the Divine Phoenix Clan, then he wouldn’t even head to the large world. However, their fates were unknown right now, so he really didn’t want to continue waiting. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Qiong Qi glanced at Yang Ye. He was about to speak when Yang Ye suddenly spoke, “I’ll go up there alone this time.”

Qiong Qi was stunned, “You’re going on your own? Did I hear you correctly?”

Yang Ye nodded, “Of course. I’m going up there on my own!”

Qiong Qi was puzzled, “What are you planning?”

Yang Ye chuckled, “What else can I do but risk my life? Wait here for me.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he transformed into a ray of light that shot up into the sky.

Qiong Qi frowned, “What is that fellow planning?”

…

Yang Ye walked through Heaven’s Door once again. This time, there were five old men standing not too far away from him!

Five Rebirth Realm experts!

Mu You gazed at Yang Ye and said, “Yang Ye, five Rebirth Realm experts are here to kill you. It’s a glorious death. It’s over now.”

Yang Ye nodded, “It should come to an end indeed!”

As soon as he finished speaking, the Sword God’s Seal suddenly glowed brightly. It didn’t take long for his sword intent to rise to the Returnal Rank again.

“Sword intent at the Returnal Rank?” Mu You shook his head, “That isn’t enough.”

Yang Ye flipped his palm, and a diagram appeared before him, “If Returnal Rank sword intent isn’t sufficient, then what if I include this?”
