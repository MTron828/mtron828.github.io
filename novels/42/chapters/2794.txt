Chapter 2795 – I’ll Never Bow to Her!

Yang Ye looked up through the clouds, and he could faintly see a woman standing high above the clouds!

She had long hair that hung down to her shoulders, wore a plain dress, and had a smile on her face.

Yang Ye looked indifferently at her. She was the true cause of everything!

Justice descended slowly from above the Four Dimensional Universe while gradually speeding up the destruction there.

The entire Four Dimensional Universe couldn’t fight back against this sword!

In the sky above Universe City.

A wave of terrifying flames suddenly erupted from Monarch Yan’s figure!

Yang Ye moved his gaze away and looked at Monarch Yan. The latter stared at Yang Ye while viciousness filled his eyes.

Yang Ye shook his head, “Allow me to be honest, she won’t spare you or your people even if you destroy the Three Dimensional Universe.”

Monarch Yan clenched his fists and remained silent.

Yang Ye continued, “She has great plans, and most importantly, she doesn’t care about the lives of others. Once she uses you to destroy my Three Dimensional Universe, you’ll be her next target.”

Monarch Yan closed his eyes slowly.

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings. He could see very, very far at his level of strength. The entire Three Dimensional Universe was engulfed by war. Besides the experts from the Four Dimensional Universe, the chaos from within the Three Dimensional Universe was another cause.

People were dying!

Many were losing their lives!

Yang Ye moved his gaze away and looked at Monarch Yan, “Do you realize it now? There will be no winner in the clash between our universes. What is the price your universe will pay to kill me and all the Destiny Realm experts of Universe City? If she really wanted to spare the Four Dimensional Universe, she could just come down here herself! My Three Dimensional Universe and your Four Dimensional Universe would probably be unable to stop her! But she hasn’t done that!”

He opened his eyes and gazed at Yang Ye. At this moment, they were blood red, “You don’t know how strong she is!”

Yang Ye replied, “I’ve experienced her strength, but should we just let order us around because she’s strong? Perhaps the end is still death, so why not die properly in battle?”

Monarch Yan fell silent. In the end, he looked up at the clouds, “My Four Dimensional Universe is already on the verge of destruction. I have less than a million people left. Even if you are planning something, those people in my Four Dimensional Universe cannot affect you at all. If I choose to submit to you, would you spare my Four Dimensional Universe?”

As soon as he said that, Monarch Yan knelt down slowly as countless watched!

In an instant, the experts from the Four Dimensional Universe started howling, and they seemed like they were pleading with sorrow in their voices!

Patriarch!

Monarch Yan was the lord of the Four Dimensional Universe because only the Yanmo Clan remained in the Four Dimensional Universe, so he represented the entire universe. Yet now, he was kneeling to Destiny.

Humiliating?

Of course it was humiliating!

However, the experts of the Four Dimensional Universe didn’t blame him because their patriarch wasn’t someone who was afraid of death. If it wasn’t for the sake of their universe, Monarch Yan would have fought Destiny to the death back then. But he was willing to let her suppress him for the sake of their universe and clan. Now, he was even kneeling to her!

The experts of the Four Dimensional Universe were in extreme pain and agony!

Yang Ye remained indifferent. He’d planned to make Monarch Yan fight Destiny with him, but now it seemed like he’d been dreaming. However, this also proved how terrifying Destiny was!

Monarch Yan was extremely strong! Even Yang Ye didn’t have the slightest bit of confidence in being able to defeat Monarch Yan! However, Monarch Yan had chosen Destiny without the slightest hesitation and displayed his loyalty in such a humiliating manner.

Kneeling!

A Destiny Transcendence Realm expert was kneeling, and he was even the lord of a universe!

If he were being honest, Yang Ye felt he couldn’t do that. So, a trace of respect toward Monarch Yan had appeared in him. This man hadn’t fallen to his knees for himself, he’d done it for his universe!

High above the clouds, the woman glanced at Monarch Yan and grinned, “I remember that you still have a trump card or contingency. What? Aren’t you going to use it?”

Monarch Yan looked up at her, “If you’re willing to spare my clan and universe, then I am willing to do anything for you!”

High above in the clouds, the woman pressed her right hand down lightly, and Justice suddenly stopped descending. A moment later, it vanished from the Four Dimensional Universe and returned to her side.

She looked down at Monarch Yan and smiled, “I’m sure you’re unhappy that you’ve surrendered before even using your trump card. Or is that you didn’t dare to take that risk in the end?”

Monarch Yan’s face was gloomy, but he didn’t answer her.

She shook her head and smiled, “I was looking forward to your trump card, so it’s quite a pity. But it’s fine because it saves me a lot of time.”

Monarch Yan spoke softly, “So you agree?”

She nodded, “I agree to spare your people. However, you must destroy the Three Dimensional Universe for me. I don’t want anyone living in the Three Dimensional Universe.”

Monarch Yan looked up at her, “You only agreed to spare my people, so what about my universe?”

She grinned, “Are you trying to negotiate with me?”

Monarch Yan’s eyes narrowed slightly while the desire to kill flashed deep within them!

Her smile grew even more moving, “You can attack, or you can even join forces with Yang Ye and that fellow hiding back there. All of you can join forces.”

“Why don’t we just fight her?” A voice suddenly resounded.

It was the mysterious expert.

Ding Shaoyao glanced at the mysterious expert and seemed like she’d thought of something.

Monarch Yan closed his eyes slowly. In the end, he looked up at the woman, “Are you really going to spare my people?”

She smiled, “If you continue hesitating, I may change my mind. To be honest, if it wasn’t for a promise I made, I would have destroyed this Three Dimensional Universe on my own. Of course, your Four Dimensional Universe would have vanished all those years ago too. Besides that, I don’t have to use you to do this. It’s just that your help will make it quicker, and I don’t feel like waiting much longer.”

Monarch Yan replied, “As you wish.”

He stood up and gazed at Yang Ye while his aura started to rise crazily.

Yang Ye ignored Monarch Yan and looked up at the woman, “Is it really that nice to play god?”

She smiled and replied with a question, “A god? I’m not a god because I disdain to be one!”

Yang Ye chuckled, “You know… it’s the first time I’ve wanted to twist someone’s neck.”

She pointed at her neck, “My head is right here. Unfortunately, no one can twist it off. Young man, you can’t too. Right, you’re only alive because I want you to live a while longer, and it’s not because you are surviving. Understand?”

Yang Ye looked up at her, “Please kill me!”

Monarch Yan feared her, the mysterious expert feared her, and he feared her too!

But just because he feared her, it didn’t mean he should cower before her.

“Haha!” She started chuckling up there.

Her smile could make any other woman dim in comparison. Unfortunately, only a few could see her right now.

Those without sufficient strength couldn’t sense where she was. Even if they could, they couldn’t discover her exact location. Of course, Monarch Yan was an exception!

Yang Ye really wanted to fight her. She was such an arrogant woman, after all! Unfortunately, he didn’t know where she was, it may not be in the Three Dimensional Universe or the Four Dimensional Universe!

The woman looked down at Yang Ye from above, “Yang Ye, oh, Yang Ye. I have to say that your character is really to my liking. Unfortunately, I know you will never make a compromise. So, good luck!”

She turned around and left.

Yang Ye moved his gaze back to Monarch Yan. Meanwhile, a suffocating wave of pressure assaulted him!

It was Monarch Yan!

Yang Ye frowned slightly. He took a quick stride forward and swung his sword.

Bang!

Monarch Yan was blasted 300m back! But just a moment later, he charged at Yang Ye again.

At the same time, the demons and experts of the Four Dimensional Universe charged into the surroundings.

Obviously, they planned to destroy the Three Dimensional Universe, not kill Yang Ye!

Yang Ye was very difficult to kill right now!

Destroy the foundation of the Three Dimensional Universe!

Meanwhile, the mysterious expert gazed at Yang Ye and Monarch Yan with coldness in his eyes, and he seemed to have no intent to interfere.

Emperor Li couldn’t help but ask, “Why don’t you do anything? If we join forces now, Yang Ye will definitely die!”

While Yang Ye was a terrifying and monstrous genius, he was absolutely incapable of resisting the joint forces of the mysterious expert and Monarch Yan. As far as they were concerned, besides Destiny, no one could deal with the joint forces of the mysterious expert and Monarch Yan.

The mysterious expert glanced at Emperor Li, “And what about after he’s dead?”

Emperor Li frowned slightly, “What do you mean?”

The mysterious expert looked up at the sky, “If Yang Ye is dead, only we will remain! Monarch Yan has chosen that woman, so once Yang Ye is gone, we will be his next target.”

Emperor Li and the others’ frowns deepened.

At this moment, they recalled that Monarch Yan had chosen Destiny in the end, and they wanted to go against Destiny!

Suddenly, Emperor Li asked, “Why don’t we choose Destiny as well?”

As soon as he finished speaking, the mysterious expert turned around abruptly and grabbed at Emperor Li. The latter’s expression changed drastically. He hadn’t expected the mysterious expert to attack abruptly and wanted to dodge it. However, it was too late, and the mysterious expert had grabbed him by the throat.Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

The mysterious expert stared at Emperor Li, “Choose her? Do you know what she did to me all those years ago? I will never submit to her, not even in the face of death!”
