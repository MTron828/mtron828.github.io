Chapter 2147 – Then I Died!

Actually, Yang Ye was joking. He didn’t have such terrible interests.

He mostly killed because someone else tried to kill him and he had no choice but to kill them!

The voice resounded once more, “It’s rare that you’ve been able to cultivate your slaughter intent to such an extent. However, let me ask you one last question. If you can attain the peak of slaughter intent, but the precondition is that you kill those closest to you and attain the Dao through slaughter. Would you be willing to do that?

Kill those closest to me?

Yang Ye shook his head, “No!”

The person asked, “Why?”

Yang Ye replied indifferently, “I only kill for two reasons, myself and my loved ones. My loved ones are the most important to me!”

The voice asked, “Then your slaughter intent may never attain the peak!”

Yang Ye smiled, “So what? That’s not a big deal.”

The voice fell silent for a long time, and then it said, “Your mentality isn’t bad!”

A middle aged man suddenly appeared in front of Yang Ye.

The middle aged man’s long hair hung down to his shoulder, and he wore a blood red robe. He had no arms or eyes, and he seemed quite terrifying.

The middle aged man asked, “Do you know why I’m the only one here?”

Yang Ye glanced at him, “Did you kill them all?”

The middle aged man nodded, “Indeed!”

Yang Ye felt speechless.

Bang!

Suddenly, a wave of slaughter intent enveloped Yang Ye. In an instant, his expression changed, and he felt like there was only one thought left in his mind.

Kill!

Kill like a madman!

Meanwhile, the slaughter intent within Yang Ye was awakened, and it surged madly out of him without end. Even his sword intent was completely suppressed by it!

Meanwhile, the slaughter intent that enveloped Yang Ye vanished abruptly.

Yang Ye gradually returned to normal.

Yang Ye gazed at the middle aged man with a solemn expression on his face. How terrifying was his will? It could be said that it wasn’t inferior to a Sage at all, and he had the Enlightened Sword Heart! Normally speaking, no one could affect his mind, and coupled with the fact that his slaughter intent was quite formidable. As far as he was concerned, it was impossible for someone to affect him with slaughter intent!

Yet now, the middle aged man had succeeded!

He'd succeeded with ease!

The middle aged man said, “Do you know how I lost my arms?”

Yang Ye shook his head.

The middle aged man said, “I chopped them off myself!”

Yang Ye felt speechless.

The middle aged man added, “When I was young, my parents passed away, and the person I loved betrayed me. At that time, I was adopted by an assassin, and I cultivated and killed like a madman for revenge. I don’t even know how many I’ve killed. At that time, I was truly killing for the sake of killing. I had no objective and just wanted to kill, kill everyone in the world. My slaughter intent grew stronger and stronger, and it grew so strong that I couldn’t control it.”

Yang Ye suddenly asked, “You were controlled by your slaughter intent?”

The middle aged man nodded, “At that time, I was a machine of slaughter. I really killed to the point of exhaustion. Finally, a day came when I even killed those closest to me. At that moment, my slaughter intent grew to its peak, and I attained the Slaughter Dao. I truly stepped into the scope of the Slaughter Dao. At that time, while I was only at the Minor Zen Realm, but even Sages were as easy to kill as slaughtering chickens!”

Yang Ye was speechless.

The middle aged man gazed at Yang Ye, “Do you know… I had very complicated emotions when I saw you!”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Why?”

The middle aged man explained, “Because while you possess the Heart of Slaughter, you’re still able to stay true to your heart. That’s something I wasn’t able to accomplish.”

Yang Ye asked, “The Slaughter Dao you spoke of… is it a kind of realm?”

The middle aged man nodded, “It is. When slaughter intent transforms, it becomes the Slaughter Dao. The Dao is after Intent, and Domain is after the Dao. In order to attain the Slaughter Dao, you must achieve a breakthrough in your slaughter intent. Let me give you an example, what would you do if your loved ones are killed?”

Yang Ye fell silent.

The middle aged man smiled, “The more someone regards their relationships as important, the easier it is to advance in slaughter intent. Because it’s very easy for the desire to kill within such people to be aroused!”

Yang Ye said, “If that’s the case, I would rather never see the day that I advance!”

The middle aged man glanced at Yang Ye and said, “Your sword is half a step into the scope of the Sword Dao, and you seem to have comprehended the Sword Domain. That makes me quite curious. You haven’t truly entered the realm of Sword Dao, so why have you been able to comprehend the Sword Domain?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “I don’t know. However, it doesn’t seem to be very helpful to me. Is it because I’m not using it correctly?”

“Not at all!” The middle aged man said, “If you used the Sword Domain earlier, your mind wouldn’t have been affected so easily. That’s one of its abilities, and is it not very helpful? Your Sword Domain can suppress many, many things. It’s your strongest trump card to surmount your realm of cultivation and kill your enemies. Without it, you wouldn’t be much of a threat to me, even if you attain the Dao with your sword.”

Yang Ye smiled, “Fine! I was greedy.”

The middle aged man said, “Since we’ve met each other, it means there’s fate between us. I’ll give you two things.”

Yang Ye felt a little anticipation.

The middle aged man suddenly flicked a fist-sized blood red pearl at Yang Ye.

Yang Ye was puzzled, “What’s this?”

“A Soulblood Pearl.” The middle aged man explained, “It’s condensed from my blood and slaughter intent. If you encounter someone you cannot defeat, you can use it. It’ll temporarily raise your slaughter intent to the Slaughter Dao Realm. However, you must remember that forcefully doing so may cause you to lose your mind. At that time, you may do something that you’ll regret forever. So, be careful when you use it.”

Be careful!”

Yang Ye glanced at it, nodded, and placed it within the Primordial Pagoda.

As soon as it entered the Primordial Pagoda, Snowy started circling it. She blinked as she gazed at the blood red pearl and was about to touch it. However, An Nanjing appeared in front of her.

Snowy gazed at An Nanjing and blinked. She was asking what An Nanjing wanted.

An Nanjing said, “You can’t touch that!” She grabbed Snowy by the tail and pulled her away.

Snowy was stunned speechless.

In the outside world.

The middle aged man gazed at Yang Ye and said, “I have a technique. It’s an ultimate move I created all those years ago. It’s called Backstab. It’s an assassination technique, and it’s the technique I used to kill all those years ago. I’ve used it countless times and improved it countless times. When I was at the Minor Zen Realm, I once used it to instantly kill no less than 10 Sages! Moreover, they weren’t even able to see a shadow of me!”

Yang Ye was stunned speechless.

Needless to say, Yang Ye was quite shocked. Killing Sages at the Minor Zen Realm, and even killing them in an instant. Such strength was quite terrifying indeed. Because he couldn’t accomplish that at all, and he could only accomplish that while joining forces with An Nanjing. Moreover, both of them were at the Major Zen Realm!

The middle aged man said, “It’s core is to use your slaughter intent’s explosive force and the energy within your vital blood. Of course, the explosive force of your slaughter intent must be used when your sword enters your target’s body. As for how to accomplish that and use your vital blood, I’ll teach you in a moment.”

Yang Ye glanced at the middle aged man, “Senior, you have conditions, right?” There was no free food in this world. Since the man was being so generous, he definitely had a request. It would be strange if he didn’t!

The middle aged man nodded, “It isn’t difficult for you to accomplish.”

Yang Ye said, “Please go ahead!”

The middle aged man explained, “I have a disciple in Void Spirit Continent called Qian Ying. I adopted her many years ago. Help me look for her and tell her to stop seeking revenge. I killed her parents, and I’ve been dead for a long time. So, she should put down her desire for revenge and return to normal!”

Yang Ye glanced at him and nodded, “Alright!”

He paused for a moment and asked, “Senior, you’ve passed away?”

The middle aged man grinned, “Is it that strange?”

Yang Ye nodded, “Who can kill you?”

As far as Yang Ye was concerned, even if the middle aged man wasn’t in the Progenitor Realm, his strength was extremely heaven defying. Even progenitors would find him difficult to kill. So, it wasn’t that easy for such an expert to die.

“There are many!” The middle aged man said, “There has never been a lack of experts in our world. The reason you haven’t encountered any is because they haven’t shown themselves. The reason I agreed to stay here is because the Dao Progenitor promised to let my inheritance be passed on, and I’ve waited so many years. Your arrival made this wait worth it.”

Yang Ye glanced at him and said, “Was the Dao Progenitor the one…”

The middle aged man shook his head, “It was someone else who killed me. Right, he used the sword, just like you.”

Yang Ye was stunned, “He used the sword like me?”

The middle aged man nodded, “I encountered him by chance. He asked me for the way, and my slaughter intent was at its peak then, so even though I hadn’t lost my mind completely, I really wanted to kill.” nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Yang Ye said, “So you attacked?”

The middle aged man nodded, “I did.”

Yang Ye asked, “And then?”

The middle aged man replied, “Then I died!”

Yang Ye was speechless.
