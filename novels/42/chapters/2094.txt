Chapter 2095 – Let’s Fight!

Something’s off!

Yang Ye couldn’t put a finger on it, but he felt that something was off, very off!

The main reason he felt something was off was the attitude of the last two Sages. The first clearly wanted to say something, but he didn’t even have the strength to say it. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

As for the second, it was the Sage who had left just now!

That Sage seemed to have recognized him!

A’Man spoke softly, “Let’s leave first!”

Yang Ye nodded, glanced at the tree, and then vanished into the sky with A’Man.

Once they left, the tree remained there.

It just stood there quietly and seemed to be waiting for something.

On the seaside, Yang Ye and A’Man sat cross-legged in silence. Both of them were thinking about what had just happened.

A long time passed before A’Man suddenly said, “What do you plan to do from now on?”

Yang Ye gazed at her, “Me?”

A’Man nodded slightly, “You seem to have been swept into the battle of paths on the Dao Path’s side. But the Dao Path’s attitude towards you is very vague, and coupled with the fact that the Sage Alliance is targeting you…” She paused for a moment and continued, “Based on my inference, since the Sage Alliance dares to target you while the Dao Path stands behind you, it’s mostly because the other paths may be supporting them. The Weapon Path, Confucianist Path, and Buddhist Path… One of them are definitely supporting them!”

“It’s most likely the Buddhist Path!” Yang Ye spoke in a low voice, “There’s some enmity between us. I don’t know if it’s the Weapon Path and Confucianist Path.”

A’Man spoke in a low voice, “I’ll help you investigate once I get back!”

“Help me investigate?” Yang Ye asked, “How? Actually, Big Sis, it’s best if you don’t get involved in my business.”

He sincerely respected her. So, he was willing to call her Big Sis. That was exactly why he didn’t want her to get involved in this because he was afraid she’d been dragged down with him!

A’Man glanced at Yang Ye with a displeased look in her eyes, “You think too little of me. Of course I can’t go against the Sage Alliance, but I can investigate.”

Yang Ye wasn’t to say something, but she interrupted him, “I know you’re afraid of dragging me down with you. But you’re overthinking. I’m just investigating, so it isn’t a big deal. Moreover, I dare not guarantee that I’ll be able to find out anything.”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and nodded, “Just as you see fit. In any case, don’t get involved if it gets dangerous. Understand? I’m not looking down on you, but you should be aware that my problems are quite complicated.”

A’Man smiled, “Of course!”

Yang Ye wanted to say something, but he suddenly withdrew a transmission stone, and Yang Lianshuang’s voice came from it.

A long time passed before a solemn expression appeared on both their faces.

Based on the information Yang Lianshuang received, a Sage had returned to the large universe, and his strength had improved tremendously. Supposedly, he’d gone to discuss the Dao with a progenitor, and that Sage had come from the Void Dimension.

So, the large universe was filled with excitement!

The Bodhi Tree in the Void Dimension was real!

It could be said that everyone in the large universe was certain of it. Especially the Sages, those in closed door cultivation had emerged and started rushing to the Void Dimension. They weren’t the only ones, even some other ordinary cultivators were on the way. Of course, they weren’t coming for the Bodhi Tree because they knew their own limits. It wasn’t something they could covet.

Even then, many were still rushing to the Void Dimension. Their objective was very simple, and it was mostly to lay eyes on the legendary Bodhi Tree!

As for the Sages, their objective was obvious.

The Progenitor Realm!

While many Sages had perished, it couldn’t stop their desire to become progenitors.

As far as they were concerned, the Bodhi Tree was a huge opportunity for them. Even if it was dangerous, they weren’t willing to give up this opportunity. Because once they succeeded, they would really become one of the few strongest existences in the world. At that time, they could remain eternal with the sun and moon, or even survive longer than that.

It was worth the risk for Sages!

Just like that, more and more rushed to the Void Dimension.

At the seaside, an old man and woman suddenly appeared not too far away from Yang Ye and A’Man!

A Sage!

A’Man had a solemn expression on her face when she saw them. It was because the old man was a Sage.

As for Yang Ye’s gaze, it had descended on the woman by the old man’s side. He recognized her, she was the woman who’d tried to scam him in the restaurant. Obviously, she’d brought help.

The old man sized up Yang Ye, “Which one of the four paths?”

Yang Ye spoke indifferently, “Don’t worry, I don’t have any backing. You can attack if you want to.”

Yang Ye was without any fear as he faced a Sage!

Even though he wasn’t confident in his ability to win in battle with a Sage, he really, really wanted to fight a Sage!

The old man gazed at him for a long time before he said, “Then let me see how monstrous the geniuses of the large universe are.”

The old man’s figure vanished on the spot.

Yang Ye looked up, and then a ray of light shot up into the sky.

Only the woman and A’Man remained here.

A’Man glanced at the woman, “Why did you offend him?”

She looked A’Man in the eyes, “He killed my mother!”

“He killed your mother?” A’Man spoke indifferently, “That fellow does have a bad temper, but based on my understanding of him, he doesn’t kill for no reason. So, you definitely did something to him.”

The woman glanced coldly at A’Man, “Is that important? He’s dead anyway!”

“Dead?” A’Man laughed coldly, “You’re too young. If you were from the large universe, you would understand what the name Yang Ye represents.”

What did it represent?

It represented an existence that should never be offended.

Besides the four paths and the Sage Alliance, was there any other organization that would rashly offend Yang Ye? In any case, the patriarch of the barbarian race had given the order to never offend Yang Ye, and even if they encountered him, they should make a compromise. Besides that, didn’t the Sovereign of Man have enmity with Yang Ye? Yang Ye had killed his son!

However, the Sovereign of Man didn’t come looking for trouble with Yang Ye.

It could be said that besides the Sage Alliance, no other organization would rashly offend Yang Ye.

If one said he had no backing, he still had the Dao Path, and many others. Most importantly, the Sage Alliance had sent many Sages for him, but Yang Ye was still alive.

So, as far as the other races were concerned, Yang Ye was like a vortex.

Of course, if one were to put it in a more direct manner, Yang Ye was a madman to them. He was a madman who couldn’t be offended at all. Because once he was offended, he would come for revenge like a madman. Moreover, no organization was willing to fight a madman like him at a time like this.

A wisp of ridicule curled up on the woman’s mouth, “Are you telling me he can defeat a Sage?”

A’Man spoke indifferently, “I don’t know if he can. But I know that he has escaped many Sages. Moreover, he’s not a pedantic fellow. If he has a chance, he will definitely fight; if he doesn’t he will definitely run. Since he hasn’t run, it’s clear that he has a chance to win.”

The woman replied coldly, “Then let’s wait and see!”

A’Man nodded, “We shall!”

High above in the sky.

Yang Ye and the old man stood in confrontation in the air, and they were around 300m away from each other.

They didn’t waste their breaths. The old man immediately raised his right hand and pressed it down in Yang Ye’s direction.

It was like the sky was collapsing!

The might of a Sage was more terrifying than the world collapsing.

At this moment, this Sage before him was just probing him. Because a Zen Realm expert could be obliterated by just the aura of a Sage.

Yang Ye stretched out his right hand, and a sword appeared in his grasp. After that, he swung it forward.

Hiss!

A ray of sword energy shot forward, the Sage’s aura was instantly obliterated.

The old man’s eyes narrowed slightly, “You really do have some ability!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he took a step forward, and then the space around Yang Ye shattered. Yang Ye was within a pitch black expanse of space, and then the black hole around him suddenly started to spin. At this moment, Yang Ye felt like he was being torn apart by a million horses, and his body felt like it was about to be torn into bits!

Bang!

A wave of powerful aura swept out from Yang Ye, and then a huge ethereal white dragon appeared behind Yang Ye.

The Sky Dragon!

Yang Ye knew that if he didn’t use the Sky Dragon, his body wouldn’t be able to resist the strength of a Sage, and only the Sky Dragon could support his body against a Sage!

The old man frowned slightly when he saw Yang Ye actually resist it. The strength of Yang Ye’s body had truly exceeded his expectations. It wasn’t something a Zen Realm expert should possess at all!

The old man restrained his thoughts and started walking in Yang Ye’s direction, “I don’t care which of the four paths you’re from. Since you dared to kill my people, you have to pay.”

The old man vanished on the spot, and a wave of powerful pressure appeared here.

Obviously, the old man was treating the battle seriously now.

Yang Ye took a deep breath, closed his eyes, and then his sword vanished.

It was replaced by a silver halberd.

Elysium!

Yang Ye opened his eyes and gazed at the old man while holding Elysium, “Let’s fight!”
