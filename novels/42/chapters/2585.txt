Chapter 2586

On the bridge.

Yang Ye continued forward.

This time, he was much calmer and composed than before. In the beginning, he’d felt a little lost and even slightly resentful.

Because it was quite unfair for Qi Bitian to just leave him here.

It was absolutely not a place someone at his level of strength could be at!

But Qi Bitian disregarded all of that and left him here, and she even sealed off his treasures, including the Primordial Pagoda.

It was very, very unfair!

However, was there absolute fairness in this world?

At this point, he was very calm, and his heart was very calm too.

This path wasn’t a long one, but he was traveling it on his own, truly traveling it on his own!

He was at the Lord Realm now, and his cultivation really wasn’t that high, or it should be described as being very low. However, his heart and sword intent weren’t at a low level at all.

He had a pure heart and pure sword intent!

This purity was different from the Unfettered One’s purity!

The Unfettered One’s purity was in the form of emotionlessness, but Yang Ye’s sword contained emotions. But besides emotions, everything else had been eliminated.

His focus on the sword had improved!

Suddenly, Yang Ye stopped because a small boat was rowing over from not too far to the right.

There were two people on it. One of them was dressed as a woodsman, and he was rowing the boat. The other was a middle aged man with a sword by his waist, and there was a wine gourd near the sword’s hilt.

The middle aged man seemed slightly drunk, and his eyes were a little dazed.

As he gazed at the boatman, quite a solemn expression arose on Yang Ye’s face.

How heavy was the Boundless Water? Yet that boatman could row a boat through it, so how strong was he?

It didn’t take long for the boat to arrive below the bridge. The boatman looked up and shot a glance at Yang Ye. He didn’t say a word and planned to continue forward.

Suddenly, the middle aged man gestured for the boatman to stop.

The boatman stopped rowing, and the boat immediately stopped on the spot.

The middle aged man glanced at Yang Ye and smiled, “Young Brother, would you like to have a drink with me?”

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and nodded slightly. He jumped down. Meanwhile, a wine gourd appeared before him, but it wasn’t the middle aged man’s wine gourd.

Yang Ye didn’t refuse and drank a mouthful of it. It was very warm, burning even!

Meanwhile, the middle aged man suddenly said, “You’re a sword cultivator?”

Yang Ye nodded.

The middle aged man smiled, “At such a young age, your sword intent is so well refined, and your heart is calm as water. To be honest, in all my years, it’s quite rare to see someone with such attainments in the younger generation. Even in my villa, few are able to attain such a level at your age!”

Yang Ye smiled, “You’re too kind!”

The middle aged man shook his head, “Kid, being so humble isn’t a good thing. The young should be arrogant. Otherwise, it would be a waste of your youth, right?”

Meanwhile, Yang Ye smiled, “I like to keep a low profile!”

The middle aged man drank a mouthful and smiled, “Why don’t I sense even the slightest inkling of that?”

Yang Ye gulped down another mouthful of the wine, and then he raised the gourd before the middle aged man, “Thank you for the wine, Senior. I have other matters to attend to, so I won’t disturb you further.”

He was about to leave once he finished speaking.

Suddenly, the middle aged man said, “Kid, are you interested in visiting Paradise Island?”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Paradise Island?”

The middle aged man glanced at him, “It’s your first time here?”

Yang Ye nodded.

The middle aged man smiled and pointed north, “There’s a small island in that direction, Paradise Island. Interested in paying it a visit?”

Yang Ye asked, “Is it fun?”

The middle aged man was stunned and roared with laughter, “It’s fun, very fun. So, wanna go play there?”

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and replied, “Alright!”

Learning more about this place was a good thing for him.

Meanwhile, the boatman spoke abruptly, “One more ticket!”

Yang Ye was about to speak when the middle aged man flicked a dark violet crystal to the boatman.

Yang Ye was curious, “What was that?”

The middle aged man shook his head, “How did you even get here? It feels like you know nothing about this place!”

Yang Ye laughed bitterly, “A senior of mine threw me here.”

The middle aged man nodded slightly, “That’s about right.”

He withdrew another dark violet crystal, “This is a Violetstar Crystal. It’s a precious crystal that’s much more precious than World Crystals. It’s the currency used here.”

Yang Ye cupped his fist to the middle aged sword cultivator, “Thank you.”

The middle aged man smiled, “Kid, to be honest, this place is quite dangerous for you.”

Yang Ye replied in a helpless tone, “I can’t do anything about it. Anyway, is that bridge the way out?”

The middle aged man nodded, “If you continue forward, you’ll arrive at a teleportation formation, and you can leave through it. However, it requires a fee. It’s very expensive, 30 Violetstar Crystals.”

30!

Yang Ye pondered deeply for a moment and asked, “How many World Crystals are required for one of them?”

The middle aged man smiled, “100! And there’s rarely anyone willing to make that exchange.”

Yang Ye shook his head. He knew he was finished.

He was utterly poor right now, so he couldn’t leave even if he got there!

During his conversation with the middle aged man, Yang Ye found out that the man’s name was Bei Jian, and he was from the Sweeping Sword Villa.

In any case, Yang Ye had never heard of it!

Jian Bei suddenly asked, “You’re from Eternal Kingdom?”

Yang Ye nodded, “You know of it?”

Jian Bei nodded, “I know a little. Actually, there’s an Ancient Sword Sect there, and there’s a young sect master leading that sect. I heard…”

He suddenly gazed at Yang Ye, “Are you that guy?”

Yang Ye smiled embarrassedly and nodded.

Pfft!

Jian Bei spat out his wine and was quite astounded, “It really is you?”

Yang Ye nodded.

A short while passed before Jian Bei shook his head and smiled, “Seriously.”

Yang Ye smiled, “You know about the Ancient Sword Sect?”

Jian Bei leaned against the side of the boat, “Not really. But I heard of it. After all, it has given birth to some great sword cultivators. However, it does seem to be on the verge of destruction now. You don’t mind me saying that, right?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “Our strength is far inferior than what it was, so it’s the truth!”

Jian Bei smiled, “But now that I’ve met you, I think that the Ancient Sword Sect will definitely rise up again in around 10 years from now, and it will be renowned throughout the universe! Of course, the precondition is that you’re able to leave this place alive!”

Leave this place alive!

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings. It was all gray and hazy. He could still see the bridge from here, and the bridge seemed to be endless in both directions.

Can I leave this place alive?

Meanwhile, Jian Bei pointed into the distance, “Paradise Island is up ahead!”

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts and looked over. There was a small island there. It wasn’t very huge, and it emanated a dark green glow. It looked quite nice from here!

It didn’t take long for the boat to dock, and they left the boat.

Meanwhile, a man in black robes walked over to them. The man glanced at them, and then appeared on the boat.

A short while later, the boat and the black robed man vanished into the distance.

Jian Bei smiled, “Let’s go!”

As they walked, Jian Bei smiled, “I can see you don’t know anything about this place, so let me explain. Paradise Island is actually a place of exchange. Right, simply speaking, people who come here leave their comprehensions in the Martial Dao or powerful techniques here. The greater the comprehension or technique you leave behind, the better the compensation you receive. In other words, you will obtain the comprehensions and techniques of another. Of course, what you get depends entirely on yourself. Besides that, there are some other services here, like a training partner or something else… Haha!”

It didn’t take long for them to arrive before a palace. Jian Bei led him into the palace.

There weren’t many people in here, and they only occasionally passed by a few people. But there were many rooms here.

Yang Ye sized up the surroundings and was quite curious.

It didn’t take long for Jian Bei to lead him into a hall. In the hall, Jian Bei glanced at him and smiled, “Good luck!”

As soon as he said that, the scene around Yang Ye changed, and then it turned pitch black. However, the darkness didn’t last for long before a pillar of light appeared in front of Yang Ye.

Meanwhile, a voice resounded, “You’re a sword cultivator, so you can leave behind your comprehensions or sword technique. If you’re unwilling, you can turn around and leave.”

Yang Ye asked, “How many have been here?”

The voice replied, “29. Among them 19 left comprehensions in the Sword Dao, and the rest left sword techniques.”

29!

Yang Ye fell silent for a moment, and then he walked over to the pillar of light. He closed his eyes while an intent sword condensed into form in his grasp. A moment later, he swung his sword rapidly!

13 Heavenrends!

When Yang Ye executed 13 Heavenrends, the pillar of light emanated a strand of dazzling light, but it didn’t take long for the light to dim down. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Yang Ye was puzzled.

Meanwhile, the voice resounded, “Sorry, that technique isn’t qualified to be here.”

Not qualified!

Yang Ye felt quite embarrassed.

Even though he hadn’t used the Sword Domain earlier, it still hadn’t been weak!

But it wasn’t qualified to be left here!

The surroundings fell silent.

Meanwhile, the voice resounded again, “You will leave this place in ten breaths of time!”

Obviously, he was being kicked out!

Yang Ye fell silent for a moment, and then he took a step forward. A wave of mysterious energy appeared in the surroundings.

Everything in the entire dark world around him was clear to him, including the person who was speaking!

The Sword Domain!

Meanwhile, the pillar of light in front of Yang Ye lit up.

Its glow grew brighter and brighter!
