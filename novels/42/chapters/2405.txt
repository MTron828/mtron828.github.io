Chapter 2406 – Kill All the Way!

A’Leng gazed at Yang Ye in silence while the divine sense of both the old man and old woman behind her had locked onto Yang Ye.

The atmosphere here was extremely tense!

As for Yang Ye, he ignored all three of them and gazed at An Nanjing.

Bang!

A muffled explosion resounded, and the robust man was blasted away!

An Nanjing wanted to follow up with another attack, but Yang Ye suddenly said, “Let’s go!”

An Nanjing stopped, walked over to Yang Ye, and then glanced at A’Leng. But it didn’t take long for her gaze to descend onto the two behind A’Leng. It was because their divine senses were locked onto Yang Ye.

An Nanjing clenched her fists, “Want to fight?”

Yang Ye was stunned speechless.

The old man glanced at her and said, “Anytime!”

An Nanjing gazed at A’Leng. The latter grinned, “Then both of you can spar! Right, it’s a spar, so spar seriously. Otherwise, it would be meaningless, right?” She gazed at Yang Ye while she spoke.

Spar seriously!

How could Yang Ye not understand what she meant? He smiled and gazed at An Nanjing, “Fight seriously!”

An Nanjing replied, “Then I’ll kill him!”

She walked over once she finished speaking.

Yang Ye’s face darkened. Even if you want to do that, just keep it in your heart and don’t speak it out loud!

She was too direct!

A’Leng chuckled, “Brother Yang, this senior of mine is at the peak of the Three World Realm. He rarely loses against others in the same realm of cultivation!”

Yang Ye smiled, “It’s fine. Besides me, she’s never lost to anyone else in the same realm of cultivation!”

A'Leng glanced at Yang Ye and smiled, “Then let’s wait and see!”

Yang Ye nodded, “Alright, we shall!”

Meanwhile, An Nanjing waved her right hand, and a black spear appeared in her grasp.

A spear!

An Nanjing held it tightly, and then she vanished on the spot.

Hiss!

The sound of space being torn apart resounded!

A huge gap in space opened up in the sky.

The old man closed his eyes slowly. Suddenly, he twisted his right hand, and then an ethereal saber appeared in his grasp.

A moment later, he grabbed it with both hands and swung it forward!

Clang!

Saber and spear collided, and the world around them shook!

An Nanjing and the old man were pushed back, but it didn’t take long for them to simultaneously stop themselves!

An Nanjing tightened her grip on the spear while she closed her eyes slowly.

Bang!

A wave of invisible energy swept out from within her.

Aura!

An imposing aura!

An Nanjing’s aura was growing stronger and stronger, and the world gradually started to tremble around her.Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

A'Leng’s eyes narrowed slightly while a wisp of solemness appeared deep within them.

An imposing aura!

An Nanjing’s imposing aura could suppress the aura of the world around her. Moreover, the most terrifying part was that it was still growing!

It was growing madly!

Pressure!

Everyone gradually sensed a wave of formidable pressure! Even Yang Ye sensed it. It pressed upon his heart, causing him to feel quite suffocated.

At this moment, Yang Ye’s expression became solemn too. Even his heart palpitated slightly before her imposing aura. Most importantly, it was still rising madly and showed no sign of stopping. So, how strong was it?

The old man’s face was unprecedentedly solemn as well!

What was most important in a battle between two armies?

Aura!

At this moment, An Nanjing’s aura had completely suppressed his own!

A formidable enemy!

At this moment, the old man stopped looking down on An Nanjing and closed his eyes slowly as he tightened his grip on the saber. The profound energy within him surged madly into the saber, and the space around him slowly started to become distorted because of that!

Suddenly, An Nanjing opened her eyes, “Take this!”

As soon as she finished speaking, she hurled the spear at the old man!

The spear shot through space!

In an instant, Yang Ye and A’Leng’s expressions turned extremely solemn!

The strength carried by the spear entirely exceeded their expectations. As far as Yang Ye was concerned, only four swings of the Sword Domain could stop this attack of hers!

Moreover, it was only a possibility!

He wasn’t confident in being able to stop it!

An Nanjing was that strong!

The old man’s face was covered in a ferocious expression. At this moment, he had no way to back down, and he had to face An Nanjing’s attack no matter what!

“Ha!” The old man shouted with fury, and then he swung the saber with both hands.

The world around him shuddered and cracked open!

The spear arrived!

Boom!

The saber exploded apart, and then the spear stabbed into the old man’s left chest.

Hiss!

The old man was blasted far away with the spear still in his chest!

Blood sprayed!

The surroundings fell silent!

She’d defeated him with a single attack!

An Nanjing glanced at the old man, “Do you want to continue?”

Continue?

Her voice was very calm, but it carried a strand of invisible confidence and overbearingness!

The old man glanced at his chest. There was a bloody hole there, and it wouldn’t heal no matter how he tried!

The old man looked up at An Nanjing and was about to speak when A’Leng suddenly said, “We admit defeat this time!”

The old man gazed at A’Leng and lowered his head slightly, “Forgive me for bringing shame to you, Young Miss!”

A'Leng smiled, “It’s normal. Senior Sky, she possesses the Martial God Physique, she’s the future Martial God!”

The Martial God Physique!

The old man’s pupils constricted, and then he gazed at An Nanjing with astonishment.

He naturally understood what the Martial God Physique represented. It was extremely terrifying even in the Eternal Dimension!

The Martial God!

An Nanjing ignored the old man and walked over to Yang Ye. She glanced at A’Leng and said, “Shall we continue?”

Continue?

A'Leng grinned, “There’ll be a chance for that in the future!”

An Nanjing nodded, “Alright!”

She moved over to Yang Ye’s side.

Yang Ye glanced at A’Leng, “Miss A’Leng, farewell.”

He left An Nanjing away and vanished into the sky.

A’Leng’s face gradually calmed down on the spot. Meanwhile, Right Sword went over to A’Leng with her head lowered, and she spoke softly, “Young Miss…”

A’Leng gazed at Right Sword, “I’ve been too good to all of you, and that made you forget your place and dare to arbitrarily decide on things.”

Right Sword knelt down and spoke in a trembling voice, “Young Miss, I-I was wrong, I’m sorry…”

“You were wrong?” A’Leng walked over to Right Sword and looked down at her, “You think I don’t want that Primordial Violet Energy? I want it, but you should see who you’re dealing with! A genius in the Sword Dao, a genius in the Martial Dao, and a Sprite Progenitor! Can Primordial Violet Energy even be compared with them?”

She bent down slightly, “I planned to become friends with him, and I did make some progress with him. Yet now, it’s all gone because of you. Not only is it all gone, we almost became sworn enemies! It’s all because of you!”

Right Sword spoke in a trembling voice, “Young Miss, I was wrong, I-I’m sorry…”

A’Leng shook her head, “That little fellow was a Sprite Progenitor. If we became friends with Yang Ye and An Nanjing, it would be equivalent to becoming friends with a Sprite Progenitor. Do you know what that represents? Do you? You don’t!”

A’Leng shook her head, “You can leave!”

Right Sword’s face turned ghastly pale. She grabbed A’Leng’s feet and said, “Young Miss, I-I really realize my mistakes. So please, please don’t make me go. Don’t make me leave. I’m begging you…”

Left Sword was about to say something, but A’Leng shook her head and vanished into the distance.

Left Sword sighed softly. She knew her young miss had made up her mind, and A’Leng’s decision was impossible to change once she’d made up her mind.

Left Sword walked over to Right Sword and spoke softly, “Just head back for now. I’ll help you talk to her once she cools down.”

Right Sword sat weakly on the ground with despair on her face.

Meanwhile, A’Leng suddenly stopped in midair, and a black clothed man appeared before her. The man took a knee and said, “Young Miss, the Patriarch has ordered your immediate return!”

A’Leng spoke indifferently, “For what?”

The black clothed man shook his head, “I don’t know.”

A’Leng looked the man in the eyes, causing cold sweat to drip down his head. A short while passed before the black clothed man hesitated for a moment and said, “It should be your marriage agreement…”

“My marriage agreement?” A wisp of disdain curled up the corners of her mouth, “What nonsense!”

The black clothed man was stunned, and then he was delighted, “Young Miss, your injuries?”

She closed her eyes slowly, “I’ve been wandering the world for so long. It’s time to head home.”

The black clothed man hesitated for a moment and said, “You seem to have encountered some trouble. Do you want me to resolve it for you?”

A’Leng shook her head, “You can’t resolve this problem of mine. Alright, forget that. Let’s go!”

“There’s one more thing!” Meanwhile, the black clothed man continued, “The patriarch received word that the Sprite Progenitor has appeared. Young Miss…”

A'Leng interrupted him and said, “I’ll head home and talk to him about that myself. Let’s go!”

She vanished on the spot once she finished speaking.

…

At a spot in the clouds, Yang Ye withdrew the Myriad World Diagram. He unfurled it and gazed at An Nanjing with a smile on his face, “Do you know what awaits us when we head back this time?”

An Nanjing glanced at Yang Ye, and then she stomped her foot down with her spear in hand.

Boom!

Space shook violently!

She closed her eyes slowly and said, “I’ll kill with you, I’ll kill with you all the way!”
