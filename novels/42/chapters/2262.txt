Chapter 2263 – Let’s Die Together!

How could he fight Xiao Lou?

As far as Yang Ye was concerned, the gap between them was too huge!

They weren’t from the same era, nor were they at the same level!

But Tian Xiu wanted him to kill Xiao Lou.

How?

Yang Ye had no choice but to put his life on the line.

Intent ignition!

He hadn’t used it in a very, very long time. Because it really was too, too detrimental. The price of it was just too heavy.

Even he wasn’t really able to endure such a price.

But he had no other choice now.

He couldn’t delay the battle with Xiao Lou, because the longer he delayed, the greater the possibility that he would die in the end. So, he had to use his full strength from the very beginning. He couldn’t hold back at all!

Intent Ignition!

Both intents burned madly, and Yang Ye’s aura rose explosively as a result!

Xiao Lou’s eyes narrowed slightly.

Intent Ignition!

He naturally understood what it was. Yang Ye could be said to be sacrificing his intent to improve his strength. As far as Xiao Lou was concerned, it was an irregular means of gaining strength, and while it would provide great strength in the short term, the price was huge. It was usually not something people could bear.

So, as far as he was concerned, Yang Ye was courting death!

Yang Ye suddenly vanished on the spot, and he was above Xiao Lou when he appeared again. A moment later, a sword slashed down.

Xiao Lou’s eyes narrowed slightly. He didn’t underestimate Yang Ye. He twisted his right hand, and a strand of black energy surged up into the air and slammed against Yang Ye’s sword.

Hiss!

Yang Ye’s sword instantly sliced the black energy apart on contact and continued down.

Bang!

Xiao Lou was blasted over 10km away!

Xiao Lou glanced at his palm, and he noticed that half of it was gone. Yang Ye’s sword had sliced off half his palm!

Meanwhile, a sword howl resounded once more.

Along with the sword howl, Yang Ye transformed into a string of afterimages that appeared before Xiao Lou, and then he swung his sword down again.

His sword seemed like it could even slice open the world, and its aura couldn’t be compared to any attack Yang Ye had launched in the past!

Xiao Lou took a step back, and then countless strands of black energy surged out from within him. In an instant, the black energy enveloped Yang Ye’s sword.

However, they were instantly sliced into bits, and the sword slammed down once more.

Bang!

Xiao Lou was blasted away again.

However, Xiao Lou chuckled. He gazed at Yang Ye, “Yang Ye, I have to admit that you’re quite strong now. Unfortunately, it’s impossible for you to kill me. Now, you have just one last attack! You…”

Suddenly, Xiao Lou’s voice stopped abruptly.

Because Yang Ye had appeared in front of him, and another attack was descending!

A cold smile arose on the corners of Xiao Lou’s mouth. In an instant, countless strands of death energy converged above him and formed a barrier. He was very confident that he could defend himself against this attack because he’d gained a full understanding of Yang Ye’s strength through the last two attacks. Yang Ye was strong, but Yang Ye wasn’t a huge threat to him.

It didn’t take long for Yang Ye’s sword to arrive above the barrier of death energy.

However, Yang Ye’s sword suddenly paused for a moment, and then Yang Ye’s features warped. Meanwhile, Xiao Lou’s expression changed drastically, and countless strands of death energy converged madly from within him. But it was too late!

Yang Ye’s sword descended.

Hiss!

The barrier of death energy was like paper that the sword instantly sliced open, and the sword sliced down from Xiao Lou’s head to feet.

The surroundings fell silent!

Yang Ye withdrew his sword and moved 300m away.

Xiao Lou stared blankly at Yang Ye, “T-That was a Domain…”

A Domain!

Yang Ye had used the Sword Domain just now!

The Sword Domain!

It was Yang Ye’s greatest trump card! In the beginning, he hadn’t used the Sword Domain against Xiao Lou because he was very well aware that he couldn’t use it to kill Xiao Lou in an instant. Just the Sword Domain couldn’t kill Xiao Lou. So, he’d chosen to ignite his intent. Once he ignited both his intents, his strength had instantly risen countless times. At this moment, the might of his attack that was enhanced by the Sword Domain would be unprecedentedly terrifying!

Moreover, in order to make Xiao Lou lower his guard, Yang Ye hadn’t used the Sword Domain for his first two attacks. Because Xiao Lou was the most vigilant then.

This battle wasn’t just a battle of strength, it was a mental battle too. Simply speaking, it was a battle of tricks.

Xiao Lou stared at Yang Ye. An instant later, he suddenly started laughing, “I didn’t expect that I would die at the hands of a Sage. Needless to say, you’re amazing, and very talented! Your Sword Domain is powerful, very powerful…”

His voice grew softer and softer, and it gradually vanished.

Xiao Lou’s body was gradually turning ethereal too, but it didn’t take long for countless strands of death energy to converge on him.

He wasn’t coming back to live, and the death energy was merely protecting his corpse!

The undying race did possess an undying body, but it depended on the situation. Yang Ye’s attack had obliterated all the vitality within him. Under such circumstances, not to mention the undying body, no one could save him.

Xiao Lou was dead!

However, Yang Ye had paid a terrible price too.

Intent was once just an ethereal concept, yet it wasn’t ethereal anymore. It could be seen, touched, and truly existed in material form. Yang Ye had ignited two intents. So, simply speaking, he had released all the intent he possessed, completely, and then ignited it all to gain strength. Even then, it wasn’t impossible for Yang Ye to regain the intent he’d lost.

It was like a rich man who’d made ten million, but he lost all that money on gambling. Even then, it didn’t represent that the rich man would never earn another 10 million. Losing the money didn’t represent he’d lost the ability to earn money. It was the same for Yang Ye. He was absolutely familiar with the Sword Dao and Slaughter Dao, so he just needed a fortuitous encounter to regain his intents to their peaks!

Now, Yang Ye was facing a problem, a different problem!

He was facing the backlash from the Intent Ignition and Sword Domain!

The backlash had already begun!

There was naturally a price to pay for using strength that exceeded one’s limits!

Veins started to pop up on Yang Ye’s face. Besides that, the blood vessels beneath his skin were starting to wriggle.

Yang Ye took a deep breath and looked down. The army of spirits from the void spirit race were in battle with the undying race's army, and it wouldn’t take long for the outcome to be determined!

Yang Ye looked to the other side. An Nanjing was in fierce battle with the 30 bow-wielding experts. No, there were only 25 left now.

An Nanjing had killed 5 of them!

But An Nanjing was heavily injured as a result!

Yang Ye closed his eyes slowly, and then he suddenly transformed into a ray of light that shot at them.

“Die!” A voice resounded like a thunderclap!

It was Yang Ye’s voice.

As soon as he arrived before them, he swung his sword with his right hand.

The Sword Domain!

At this moment, the strength he gained from Intent Ignition had not vanished yet, so he used the Sword Domain again. So, how terrifying was his attack?

The black robed figure before him was instantly obliterated before his sword!

An instant kill!

An Nanjing was stunned by this.

She was shocked that Yang Ye had become so strong!

However, it only took a moment for quite an unsightly expression to appear on her face. Because she’d realized the state he was in. Yang Ye was over-exhausting himself right now. Yang Ye could kill anyone now, but it wouldn’t be long before Yang Ye had to pay a terrible price!

Meanwhile, after he killed that black robed figure in an instant, Yang Ye transformed into a ray of light that shot at another one of them. Over 20 arrows suddenly appeared before Yang Ye, but along with a swing of his sword, all of them were obliterated.

Hiss!

A moment later, a black robed figure was sliced into two, and then blood and internal organs sprayed all over the surroundings!

But that wasn’t the end of it!

A ray of light flashed, and then the head of another black robed figure flew up into the air.

A slaughter!

At this moment, Yang Ye was slaughtering them. None of them could resist a single swing of Yang Ye’s sword. Even if they joined forces, Yang Ye could overcome their joint forces with a swing of his sword. In his current state, even an expert like the Martial Emperor couldn’t kill him!

In just a short while, only 10 of those black figures remained. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Meanwhile, Yang Ye stopped.

The backlash!

The pain!

At this moment, Yang Ye felt like his body was on the verge of exploding. Even the Primordial Violet Energy that was madly repairing his body couldn’t reduce the pain he experienced.

Swoosh!

Suddenly, an arrow pierced through his chest. The Primordial Armor couldn’t stop it at all. However, that wasn’t the end of it. Another arrow shot toward Yang Ye’s forehead, but it was slammed away by a spear before it could even approach Yang Ye.

An Nanjing stood before him.

Yang Ye used both hands to support himself with his sword, and he gasped for breath, “I-I don’t think I’ll be able to hold on this time. J-Just go!”

He was utterly exhausted!

At this moment, he was truly exhausted!

An Nanjing turned around, gazed at Yang Ye for a long time, and then she squatted down and pecked him on the forehead, “We die together!”

As soon as she finished speaking, she turned around, and then her body started to burn.

Soul Ignition!

In an instant, An Nanjing’s aura rose explosively!
