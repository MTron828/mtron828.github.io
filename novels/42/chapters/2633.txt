Chapter 2634 – Happy Now?

Watch the show!

Elder Xue shook her head on the mountain top.

She knew he would probably get into trouble in the end!

…

Eternal Border.

At this moment, the battle was still going on.

Liu Yuan walked slowly toward Huang Xuan, “Huang Xuan, I heard you’re the strongest in the desolate race besides the Desolate Emperor. I’d like to see for myself!”

Huang Xuan roared with laughter, “I too would like to see how strong the strongest in the War Dimension is!”

As soon as he finished speaking, his figure turned ethereal.Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

A moment later, a wave of powerful energy tore through space toward Liu Yuan!

Liu Yuan’s eyes narrowed slightly, and she pressed her palms together!

Bang!

At the instant they were pressed together, a wave of destructive force exploded forth.

Bam!

In an instant, Huang Xuan was blasted away, but just a moment later, he charged at her with his axe in hand.

Boom!

The world shook as countless spatial rifts cracked open, and Liu Yuan was pushed backward repeatedly!

“Haha!” Huang Xuan roared madly with laughter, “Come on! Let’s continue!”

He charged at Liu Yuan again.

While Liu Yuan and Huang Xuan fought, the Demon King of War Dimension and the other ancestors of the various clans had charged at the desolate race’s forces.

It could be said that if the desolate race had no Destiny Realm experts, then it would be annihilated!

These ancestors of the various clans were definitely not existences that the Desolate Deathguards could resist! After all, their realms of cultivation were different!

The desolate race naturally didn’t have just two Destiny Realm experts!

The Demon King’s group stopped abruptly because an old man with a bamboo cane had appeared before them.

As soon as they saw him, the Lu Clan’s Ancestor, Lu Xuanji’s face instantly turned unsightly, “Huang Buer, you’re actually still alive.”

Huang Buer!

The previous patriarch of the desolate race. The Desolate Emperor had taken over after him.

He was an expert from many, many years ago. Only a few people in the world recognized him now. However, he wasn’t an unfamiliar face to some of the old experts of Eternal Kingdom.

Because Huang Buer had once entered Eternal Kingdom!

However, along with the Desolate Emperor’s meteoric rise, Huang Buer had gradually vanished from the limelight. It wasn’t that he wasn’t strong, it was just that the Desolate Emperor had been too dazzling!

Huang Buer glanced at Lu Xuanji with ridicule on his lips, “You’re from the Lu Clan, huh? You’re much inferior when compared to your grandfather.”

Lu Xuanji spoke coldly, “We’ll only know that for sure after we fight.”

Huang Buer glanced at the others by Lu Xuanji’s side and said, “Come at me together!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he raised his right hand slightly and raised it in their direction.

Bang!

The space around Lu Xuanji’s group warped!

At the same time, Huang Buer charged into the warped space with his cane in hand.

Meanwhile, a ray of blood red sword energy appeared in the sky.

It was Yang Ye.

The Soul Sect’s Master and the others’ expressions instantly turned unsightly when they noticed Yang Ye’s arrival!

Yang Ye!

They had naturally not forgotten this monstrous fellow!

If Yang Ye helped the desolate race now, they would be in big trouble. This fellow’s strength was something ordinary Destiny Realm experts were no match for! That wasn’t even the main point, the main point was that he had the backing of two terrifying existences!

Not to mention that they may not even be able to kill him, but even if they could, they wouldn’t really dare to!

What if those two women survived?

Fortunately, Yang Ye didn’t attack, and this allowed them to heave sighs of relief!

Yang Ye naturally didn’t do anything. He had no intention of interfering in the battle between the Eternal Kingdom and desolate race. Even though he wanted to annihilate the powers of Eternal Kingdom, acting now would definitely make Eternal Kingdom use their trump cards on him.

Moreover, the Desolate Emperor had great aspirations, and Yang Ye was quite vigilant toward him!

Yang Ye glanced at the Desolate Deathguard and War Guard. At this moment, their battle was at its peak. The Desolate Deathguard still had 16 of their 18 members, but the War Guard had less than 30 of their members left!

Yang Ye shook his head slightly. Their cultivations may be on par, but the War Guard lacked ferocity and ruthlessness. As for the Desolate Deathguard, they were truly unafraid of death, and they had a form of conviction!

Their conviction was to fight for the desolate race! They were ready to die for it!

Yang Ye could sense that these Deathguards actually had no intention to survive. So, the War Guard were naturally suppressed.

At most times, it wasn’t strength that determined the outcome of a battle, it was fearlessness of death!

Yang Ye looked up at the distant battlefield in the sky. The Desolate Emperor was fighting four experts on his own!

He was suppressing four of them on his own!

Just like Tian Xiu had done that day!

Needless to say, the Desolate Emperor and Tian Xiu were the most outstanding geniuses of this era!

Suddenly, Yang Ye looked down. Six black clothed figures with sickles in their grasps suddenly appeared there .They didn’t join the battle and charged at Eternal Kingdom instead!

Experts of the desolate race!

These six experts were even more terrifying than the Desolate Deathguards and War Guards!

Their auras were terrifying!

All of them were peak Lord Realm experts. However, their auras were even more terrifying than some Destiny Realm experts!

It could be said that even he wasn’t confident in being able to best their joint forces!

Were they the desolate race’s trump card?

Suddenly, a group of people appeared before them. They were the elites of the various clans, including the experts of the Soul Sect, the generals of the demon race, and some elites of the War Dimension!

They were obstructing the path of those six figures!

Yang Ye saw two familiar people in the group. It was Ye Zhibei and Xing Biqing!

Yang Ye frowned upon noticing them.

Meanwhile, an expert from Eternal Kingdom was the first to charge forward, but it only took a moment for an afterimage to flash, causing Xing Biqing’s expression to change.

That expert from the Eternal Kingdom was still charging forward, but his head was gone.

His body was charging but his head was gone!

Behind the falling head was a black clothed figure who was putting away their sickle. A strand of blood was slowly dripping from the sickle!

An instant kill!

While they were both at the Lord Realm, that expert from Eternal Kingdom had been killed in an instant!

Ye Zhibei and the others had extremely solemn expressions on their faces!

Even Yang Ye’s face was rather solemn because that black clothed figure’s strength was really quite shocking!

Suddenly, a loud explosion resounded in the sky, and then Liu Yuan and Huang Xuan appeared in midair.

They seemed to be equally matched if judged by their outward appearance alone!

Huang Xuan glanced at the six sickle-wielding figures and smiled, “Liu Yuan, these six disciples of ours are pretty good, right? Haha!”

Huang Xuan seemed to have thought of something and gazed at Yang Ye, “You’re Yang Ye, right?”

Yang Ye nodded, “I am!”

Huang Xuan grinned, “I heard you’ve been to Darkspace.”

Yang Ye nodded, “I have. Why?”

Huang Xuan smiled, “These six disciples of mine trained there!”

Yang Ye understood why they were so strong now. It turned out that they’d trained in that crazy place.

Someone who’d never been there would never understand how terrifying that place was!

Suddenly, Huang Xuan smiled, “Yang Ye, I heard you’re the most monstrous genius in this world’s younger generation. Is that true?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “I dare not say so!”

Huang Xuan grinned, “Why be so humble? I’ll be direct. Are you interested in fighting one of those six disciples of my desolate race?”

Yang Ye shook his head again, “I’m not interested.”

Huang Xuan chuckled, “Are you afraid?”

Yang Ye glanced at the arrogant Huang Xuan and replied indifferently, “I’m afraid I wouldn’t be able to stop myself from killing all of them.”

The surroundings instantly fell silent.

Countless gazed at Yang Ye, including those six sickle-wielding black clothed figures.

They had never feared anyone in the same realm of cultivation. Or it should be said that even fighting an ordinary Destiny Realm expert wasn’t difficult for them!

As for Yang Ye, he was merely in the same realm of cultivation as them!

Arrogance!

Absolute arrogance!

That was Huang Xuan’s impression of Yang Ye.

Liu Yuan glanced at Yang Ye and remained silent.

Huang Xuan started laughing, “Yang Ye! Oh, Yang Ye! You’ve really surprised me! However, these disciples of my race would still like to seek guidance from you.”

As soon as he finished speaking, one of them stepped forward, and that black clothed figure’s divine sense locked onto Yang Ye!

Yang Ye fell silent for a short moment, and then he gazed at Huang Xuan, “You don’t seem to like me?”

Huang Xuan cracked a smile, “A little. Of course, I’m not trying to target you. I just hate the sight of all arrogant people, and so you make me feel a little unhappy!”

Yang Ye nodded slightly, “I see!”

A moment later, he vanished on the spot.

A ray of blood red flashed!

Huang Xuan’s eyes narrowed slightly at the instant Yang Ye vanished, and the black clothed figure before Yang Ye vanished a moment later.

Hiss!

The black clothed figure’s sickle seemed to slice through something, causing a sharp and ear piercing screech to resound!

A ray of red and black intersected!

Three breaths of time later!

Yang Ye sheathed his sword behind the black clothed figure.

The black clothed figure behind him suddenly split open into two, and blood and internal organs sprayed all over the ground!

An instant kill!

Yang Ye turned around and glanced at Huang Xuan, “Happy now?”
