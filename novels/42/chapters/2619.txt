Chapter 2620 – Xiu!

Outside the Primordial Pagoda.

The entire Origin World was in chaos!

Utter chaos!

Yang Ye’s Slaughter Domain and slaughter intent were too terrifying. Practically none below the Destiny Realm could resist it! Even ordinary Destiny Realm experts couldn’t resist Yang Ye.

After all, while he wasn’t at the Destiny Realm, his slaughter intent was at the Destiny Realm! Coupled with his own terrifying strength and Executor, it could be said that ordinary Destiny Realm experts had no advantage in battle against Yang Ye!

At this moment, Yang Ye could kill Destiny Realm experts on his own!

As for those beneath the Destiny Realm… It could be said that if the experts on par with the Divine Abode’s Master didn’t interfere, then Yang Ye was like a tiger pouncing into a flock of sheep right now!

He could do as he pleased!

Of course, the young girl hammering the bridge couldn’t be overlooked either!

If she was allowed to continue, the entire bridge would be turned to ash!

She had the ability to accomplish that!

Of course, their main enemy was Qi Bitian!

If they couldn’t kill her, then killing Yang Ye and the others would make no difference. After all, Yang Ye and the others could do as they pleased because Qi Bitian was keeping the other experts at bay!

Yang Ye and the others could be crushed in an instant once she was gone!

In the air.

Mr. Jing sized up Qi Bitian and said, “Your strength is shocking. None of us here has the ability to fight you on our own. So, you don’t mind if we join forces against you, right?”

Qi Bitian shook her head, “I don’t. It’ll only be a little interesting if you do.”

Mr. Jing nodded slightly, glanced at the surroundings, and said, “I know all of you are proud people. However, I’m sure you’ve witnessed how strong she is. Of course, if any of you think that you can defeat her in single combat, you can step forward now, and we’ll give you a chance to do that!”

Single combat!

The surroundings remained very silent!

Single combat?

No, none of them could ever fight Qi Bitian on their own.

However, Qi Bitian suddenly gazed at the Desolate Emperor, “Aren’t you going to try?”

The Desolate Emperor shook his head, “I really want to. However, it’s pointless for me to join in right now. Moreover, I’m not foolish enough to help the Eternal Kingdom and Origin World.”

Qi Bitian nodded, and then she gazed at the Divine Abode’s Master and the others, “Then bring it!”

Mr. Jing pushed his right hand forward, and there was a thread in his grasp.

A violet gold threat!

Qi Bitian frowned slightly at the sight of this, “Violet Dimensional Threads. I didn’t expect you to really be from my era. Moreover, you’re not an ordinary expert from then either.”

Mr. Jing grinned, “I’m no one before Senior Qi.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he tapped his finger forward, and the thread flashed.

Hiss!

A moment later, a huge expanse of space in the sky underwent a change!

It was covered in the threads! Or to be more precise, the threads had embedded themselves in space!

Mr. Jing smiled, “Senior Qi, your strength is shocking, so destroying these threads won’t be difficult for you at all. However, based on your current strength, exhausting too much strength and time on these threads will probably be disadvantageous to you.”

Qi Bitian glanced at the surroundings and smiled, “You don’t want me to obliterate the space here. It’s fine, I’ll just avoid doing that.”

She gazed at Mr. Jing and the others, “Didn’t you want to kill me? What are you waiting for? Bring it!”

Bring it!

Qi Bitian’s smile still remained on her face!

Mr. Jing nodded slightly, “Then allow me to lead the charge!”

He took a step forward, and it was like the descent of a myriad mountains. The space around Qi Bitian shook, and then it started to compress in layers!

Compression of space!

Qi Bitian glanced at the space around her and grinned, “You used the Violet Dimensional Threads to fortify the space here to restrict my ability while improving your own. Needless to say, it’s a very good idea. Unfortunately, you’re too weak.”

Qi Bitian clenched her left fist and slammed it forward!

Bang!

The space around her started to shake violently!

A wave of powerful energy obliterated the space around her!

At this moment, Mr. Jing’s face was quite unsightly!

Qi Bitian was too, too strong!Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

So strong that he couldn’t suppress her at all!

He didn’t dare try his luck and gazed at the surroundings instead, “Help me seal her!”

Seal!

Suddenly, a voice resounded, “Why aren’t we killing her?”

It was the Soul Sect’s Master!

He wished for Qi Bitian’s death the most. Because once she was dead, Yang Ye would have no one to rely on, and if that happened, he could kill Yang Ye!

The enmity between Yang Ye and the Soul Sect was simply irreconcilable!

Or it should be said that the enmity between Yang Ye and the joint forces of the Soul Sect and Eternal Kingdom was irreconcilable!

Mr. Jing glanced coldly at the Soul Sect’s Master, “Kill her? Even Destiny couldn’t kill her, so how will you?”

Kill her?

No!

Mr. Jing had never considered killing Qi Bitian. An existence like her was impossible to kill, or it should be said that she wasn’t someone they could kill! Even if she wasn’t at her prime, even if she’d sealed off some of her strength, and even if she was severely injured, she wasn’t someone they could kill!

Even though he was from the same era as her… It was like the difference between Yang Ye and many others in the same realm of cultivation as well. They were from the same era as Yang Ye, but they weren’t on the same level!

Seal her!

Mr. Jing had planned to seal Qi Bitian from the very beginning!

Of course, just his own strength was entirely incapable of accomplishing that. But he wasn’t alone right now!

A moment later, countless formidable auras appeared in the space around Qi Bitian.

Once this energy appeared, the trembling space around Qi Bitian gradually calmed down. Moreover, the threads embedded in the space around her started to shrink in her direction!

Besides that, at least four Domains appeared around her!

The Desolate Emperor clicked his tongue and grinned, “The Water Domain, Soul Domain, Temporal Domain, and… What is that? I’ve never seen it before!”

There was a great amount of interest in the Desolate Emperor’s eyes!

“The Spiritual Domain!” Qi Bitian spoke indifferently, “It’s a Domain formed by one who cultivates in the spirit. The Domain uses spiritual energy at its foundation and exerts tremendous mental pressure on others. It should be said that it suppresses the enemy’s spirit so that the enemy will fall into deep sleep. It can kill without anyone noticing its presence. Just the slightest mistake may cause one to just die without making a sound!”

The Desolate Emperor gazed at her, “You make it sound so formidable, but you don’t seem to be affected at all!”

Qi Bitian replied indifferently, “Even the will of the Heaven Dao couldn’t harm me, a mere Spiritual Domain is too weak!”

The Desolate Emperor nodded slightly, “You’re amazing.”

He moved aside as he spoke.

Qi Bitian didn’t fight back, but the space around her and those threads were shrinking at an increasingly slower pace!

Moreover, more and more energy was surging at Qi Bitian!

Qi Bitian, who was at the center of it all, glanced to the right, and it was completely empty.

She moved her gaze away and looked down.

Down below, Erya was still ceaselessly hammering the bridge, and every strike of hers would cause the bridge to shake. Moreover, she’d destroyed around 3km of the bridge by now.

And she was still doing it!

The people of the Origin World would naturally not allow her to continue. It didn’t take long for the Boundless Water beneath her to roil, and then a colossus emerged from the water!

A powerful aura instantly locked onto Erya!

Erya stopped and gazed at it!

Its true appearance couldn’t be discerned clearly because it was enveloped by Boundless Water. The water was actually armor around it!

A thick armor!

Erya’s fists suddenly transformed into claws.

She walked toward the colossus while icy coldness filled her eyes!

Boundless icy coldness!

She was furious, and she had gone berserk!

Snowy and Yang Ye were her loved ones, they were the closest to her. Especially Snowy, Snowy and her were so close they could eat the same tanghulu… It could be said that Snowy wasn’t just Yang Ye’s reverse scale, Snowy was Erya’s reverse scale too!

Erya charged forward!

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!

Sharp and ear piercing sounds of something being torn open resounded.

The thick armor of Boundless Water was like paper before her claws, and she cut through it with ease. After that, she opened her mouth and made a biting motion in its direction…

It was a very amusing scene!

Because Erya was too, too small. Her mouth was naturally small as well, yet she was trying to bite it!

Many started laughing when they witnessed this!

However, it only took a moment for their smiles to stiffen.

Because the colossus let out a shrill and miserable cry!

Moreover, it was shrinking rapidly!

Erya was eating it alive!

She was eating the colossus alive!

She ate energy, the energy within it.

Of course, she ate its flesh too, and she was eating it raw!

The colossus could only let out shrill and miserable cries on the spot. It wanted to resist, but it couldn’t move at all!

It was being suppressed!

The Desolate Emperor’s eyes narrowed slightly, “Bloodline suppression… Interesting indeed. She’s actually able to suppress a demon beast that’s stronger than her…”

The demon beast was a Destiny Realm expert!

But Erya had suppressed it!

She was just at the Lord Realm!

Qi Bitian grinned, “Your Bloodline Energy is finally awakening a little…?”

Meanwhile, Yang Ye had started to slaughter madly, and the entire Origin World was filled with monstrous slaughter intent!

Now, countless had lost their lives beneath his blades.

He killed anyone he saw!

He’d gotten addicted to the slaughter!

There was just one thought in his mind now! Kill!

But it didn’t take long for a strand of silver light to flash.

Bang!

An explosion resounded, and Yang Ye was blasted over 1km away!

A moment later, six figures appeared near Yang Ye!

They were led by a saber-wielding old man!

The sect master of the Demon Blade Sect, Gu Mo!

A Destiny Realm expert!

The others behind him were Destiny Realm experts too!

All of them were part of the powers in the Origin World!

Gu Mo glanced coldly at Yang Ye, “You’ve gone mad with slaughter. You’re no different than an animal, and today is the day your life will come to an end!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he was about to attack. However, a fluffy little fellow appeared on Yang Ye’s shoulder!

Snowy!

Snowy glanced coldly at Gu Mo, and then she looked to the side and opened her mouth…

A word came from her!

But it was soundless!

Xiu!
