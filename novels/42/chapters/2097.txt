Chapter 2098 – Genius From the Confucianist Path!

Yang Ye and A’Man returned to Hidden Dragon City, and then she left.

She was returning to the barbaric race to help Yang Ye find out about the Sage Alliance.

Yang Ye was quite against it in the beginning because he really didn’t want her to get mixed up in it. The Sage Alliance wasn’t an organization that she could afford to offend. However, his refusal didn’t make a difference, so he had no choice but to just tell her to be careful.

Once she left, Yang Ye wanted to look for a place to rest, but a young man appeared not too far away from him.

The young man seemed to be a little over 20. He wore a cloud white robe and held an emerald flute.

He grinned to Yang Ye, “The Confucianist Path, Li You.”

The Confucianist Path? Yang Ye frowned slightly, “What? Does the Confucianist Path want my head too?”

Li You shook his head slightly, “I came looking for you merely for a spar, and nothing else.”

A spar!

Yang Ye glanced at him, “I don’t like meaningless fights!”

Li You smiled, “If I’m not wrong, you very rarely have any opponents in the younger generation, right?”

Yang Ye nodded, “That’s true!”

Li You said, “Now, you may have found one. So, want to try?”

Confidence!

Li You had confidence that came from the heart.

Yang Ye felt slightly interested.

He glanced at the surroundings and said, “Shall we go somewhere else?”

He wanted to spar with the geniuses of the younger generation too.

Li You grinned when he heard Yang Ye, “Of course!”

They vanished on the spot.

High above in the sky.

Their strength was entirely sufficient to open up a battlefield in space, and they stood in confrontation within it with around 300m between them.

Meanwhile, Li You said, “Brother Yang, it’s just a spar without any link to any enmity. So, we’ll stop once victory is decided. Alright?”

Yang Ye glanced at him. Needless to say, he had a good impression of the young man. The young man wasn’t overbearing. Of course, it was just an impression.

Yang Ye nodded, “Alright!” He didn’t want any enmity to be created between him and the Confucianist Path either.

Li You nodded and took a step forward. A moment later, the emerald flute in his grasp floated up to his mouth, and then a pleasing tune floated from it. In the beginning, it was like a stream that was flowing gradually, but it didn’t take long to grow louder like crashing waves.

In the beginning, Yang Ye didn’t feel anything was off, but it didn’t take long for his expression to change drastically.

Because the profound energy within him was actually vanishing gradually. Besides that, the spirit energy in the surrounding space was vanishing too. However, it should be said that it wasn’t vanishing but rejecting him instead. The spirit energy was actually rejecting him!

Snowy was furious when she sensed this, and she was about to wave her paw. However, Yang Ye stopped her.

It was a fair fight, so he didn’t want her to interfere. Because if she did, the spirit energy would definitely return, and she would probably even suck away all the spirit energy around Li You.

However, this wasn’t just a normal battle to Yang Ye, it was a fair battle.

Yang Ye still had his physical body even if he lost the use of spirit energy!

Yang Ye slammed his fist forward!

Bang!

A wave of powerful energy swept out like a tornado. The sound of the flute stopped abruptly, but a ray of green light instantly arrived before Yang Ye like a venomous snake.

Yang Ye swung another punch.

Bang!

An explosion resounded and Yang Ye was blasted almost 300m away. As soon as he stopped himself, Li You vanished on the spot, and he was in front of Yang Ye when he appeared again. After that, he pointed the emerald flute at Yang Ye.

Yang Ye didn’t dodge and slammed his fist forward.

As soon as the flute was about to touch Yang Ye’s fist…

Boom!

Suddenly, a deafening boom resounded from the flute. It sounded a little like a dragon roar, yet it was different. It dazed Yang Ye, and the flute in Li You’s grasp moved around Yang Ye’s fist and tapped against his chest.

Bam!

Yang Ye felt like a sledgehammer had slammed against his chest, and he was blasted over 3km away. As soon as he stopped himself, Li You was in front of him, and then the latter stretched out his right hand and slapped it down at Yang Ye. It didn’t carry any might, and it seemed like a very friendly slap. It was so gentle like floating cotton.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye had recovered completely, and he slammed his fist forward. However, when his fist was about to strike Li You’s palm, Yang Ye’s fist suddenly changed its trajectory and slammed against the young man’s chest. As for Li You’s palm, it slapped against Yang Ye’s chest too.

Bam!

Yang Ye was blasted away again, and he flew almost 3km away!

However, Li You didn’t move at all!

Li You didn’t stop. He took a step forward, and appeared in front of Yang Ye. This time, he didn’t use his palm, and he played the emerald flute instead.

In an instant, Yang Ye bled from all seven apertures.

Actually, it was a melodious tune. It was soft at moments and intense at moments, it was a beautiful tune. However, it was deadly in Yang Ye’s ears, and a force he’d never come into contact with in the past was invading his head.

Bang!

A wave of terrifying aura swept out from Yang Ye, and then a huge, ethereal white dragon appeared behind him.

The Sky Dragon!

As soon as he used the Sky Dragon, the mysterious force was kept away from him and couldn’t enter his mind.

“The Sky Dragon!” Li You spoke abruptly, “I can’t believe it. The guardian divine beast of the sky race is actually in your possession. Moreover, it seems to have fully merged with you. Brother Yang, that’s amazing.”

Yang Ye replied, “You’re amazing too. You’re completely unharmed after taking a punch of mine head-on!”

His physical strength was extremely terrifying, but Li You had been completely unharmed by it, and that puzzled Yang Ye.

Li You smiled, “It's an aura, scholarly aura. The more learned someone is, the stronger it is. It can protect the body or be used in other ways.” He paused for a moment and continued, “Brother Yang, you should draw your sword. Only then will this spar have meaning. What do you think?”

Yang Ye nodded, “Indeed!”

As soon as he finished speaking, a sword appeared in his grasp. He didn’t dare to be overconfident because the young man was extremely strong, so he didn’t dare to do that at all.

The young man smiled when he saw Yang Ye withdrew a sword, “Come, let’s fight for real.” As soon as he finished speaking, he suddenly shot up into the sky, and then a beautiful tune slowly resounded. In an instant, the space in the surroundings rippled, and there was a mysterious energy flowing through it.

Scholarly Aura!

The Scholarly Aura of the Confucianist Path!

The more learned they were, the stronger it was!

Danger!

Yang Ye sensed danger this time. He glanced at the surroundings and took a step forward. A moment later, a mysterious wave of energy appeared here. An instant later, 100 swords appeared within the Sword Domain, and then countless rays of light appeared. The rays of light instantly enveloped the aura, causing explosions to resound through the area!

Rumble!

Explosions resounded incessantly. While the space here had collapsed, their battle still hadn’t come to an end!

Boom!

An ear piercing explosion resounded, and then Yang Ye and Li You split apart. At this moment, they were over 1km away from each other.

Li You glanced at himself, and he saw no less than ten injuries! Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Even though his Scholarly Aura was powerful, it wasn’t invincible. Yang Ye’s sword energy could pierce through it. However, Yang Ye was clearly not unharmed as well. There were over a dozen injuries on him too.

While he was injured, these injuries were nothing to Yang Ye. Since he had the Primordial Violet Energy, unless his enemy could give him a lethal injury, he would remain a god of war, an undying god of war!

The most terrifying aspect about Yang Ye wasn’t his Sword Dao, it was his recovery.

Meanwhile, LI You suddenly smiled, “Brother Yang, you’re amazing indeed. In the younger generation, perhaps there’s only one person capable of competing with you in the Sword Dao. Of course, if this is the limit of your Sword Dao, then that person may be slightly superior. I have no ill intent when I say all of this, and I’m just telling you the truth.”

Yang Ye asked, “Who is it? I’m quite curious!”

Li You smiled, “He’s from the Buddhist Path, and he cultivates the Heart Sword. Right, we call him the Sword Buddha. His Sword Dao is extremely formidable. However, his Sword Dao is completely different from yours. Yours carries an overwhelming desire to kill, and my Scholarly Aura finds it difficult to resist.”

Yang Ye smiled, “The sword is used to kill. That’s what I think. So, its desire to slaughter is naturally a little strong.”

“Understandable!” Li You nodded, “Let’s stop here, alright? We’ll have to decide on life and death if we continue.”

Yang Ye replied, “Alright, let’s spar again another time.”

Li You cupped his fists to Yang Ye, “See you!” He turned around and left.

Yang Ye glanced at Li You, and then a wisp of blood seeped out slowly from the corner of his mouth. It seeped out incessantly and took just a short while to dye the front of his clothes red.

At the same time, Li You suddenly stopped over 100km away. As soon as he did, his right arm fell off his shoulder.

This was why they had stopped fighting.

Just as Li You had said, they would really have to decide on life and death if they continued.
