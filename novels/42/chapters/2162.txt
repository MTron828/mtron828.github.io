Chapter 2163 – Come! Let’s Fight One on One!

The hall fell perfectly silent!

Declare war against the Alliance of All and the Buddhist Path!

What kind of powers were they? It could be said that even if the Buddhist Path was put aside, the Alliance of All was sufficient to crush the human race. If the Alliance of All wasn’t worried about the god race, the human race would have been annihilated a long time ago! As for the Buddhist Path, it was worse. They had a progenitor, and just one progenitor could annihilate everyone here.

But Yang Ye wanted to declare war against them. They felt that this was quite rash!

Even Lin Zhen felt that Yang Ye was being quite rash!

Yang Ye glanced at them and said, “All of you think I’m being rash?”

All of them remained silent.

Yang Ye sighed softly, “Do you know what our human race lacks the most right now?”

All of them gazed at Yang Ye.

“Courage!” Yang Ye continued, “At most times, our human race lacks courage. Why do we have to fear the Buddhist Path and Alliance of All? No, we should make them fear us! I’m declaring war against them to tell them that we aren’t afraid of them. If they want to fight, then we’ll fight them to the end! Allow me to be frank, if we act like cowards, then they will attack us again. Of course, they will still attack us once we declare war against them, but the morale and imposing aura we have will be completely different. Because we declared war on them!”

He walked over to them and said, “Our human race is too lacking in morale right now, so we need it. We need that kind of morale where we dare to fight any organization. At the same time, I’m using this opportunity to tell the entire human race that we’re no cowards, and we dare to fight!”

As soon as he finished speaking, the surroundings were perfectly silent! Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Needless to say, it made their blood boil a little.

Just as Yang Ye had said, everyone in the human race, including them, felt that they were no match for the Alliance of All and the Buddhist Path. It was even to the extent that some were praying that the Alliance of All and Buddhist Path wouldn’t attack them!

What kind of attitude was that?

The attitude of a coward!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye emphasized, “Everyone, we need morale, and we need to tell the Alliance of All, the Buddhist Path, and all those organizations hiding in the shadows that even if we’re weak, we dare to fight them.”

Yang Ye turned around and walked away once he finished speaking.

The hall still remained extremely silent after he left.

A long time passed before Lin Zhen suddenly said, “Perhaps we are getting too old, and we’ve lost the hot blood within us.”

All of them fell silent.

Lin Zhen gazed at the old man who spoke earlier, “Elder Mu, what do you think?”

Elder Mu fell silent for a long time and replied, “He’s right. We need it. So, Brother Lin Zhen, please go declare war!”

Lin Zhen nodded, “So we shall!”

The human race declared war against the Alliance of All and the Buddhist Path!

As soon as news of this spread, the entire large universe was shocked, and the entire Human Dimension was filled with clamorous noise. Some said Yang Ye had balls, some said he was brainless. But no matter what, the declaration of war was very real.

The Alliance of All was caught off guard by this declaration.

Because they hadn’t expected the human race to dare to do something like this!

Was the human race tired of living?

Countless people in the Alliance of All had that thought, but they noticed that the Alliance of All and the Buddhist Path didn’t dare to attack the human race right now. It wasn’t just because of the god race, there was another reason, and it was because the human race had two experts.

Yang Ye and An Nanjing!

While they were just at the Major Zen Realm, the Alliance of All didn’t dare to underestimate them. Because they’d made the Alliance of All pay a painful price!

Unless the Alliance of All could annihilate the two of them at once, then not to mention the Alliance of All, even the Buddhist Path wouldn’t be able to endure their revenge! Of course, they wouldn’t just let themselves fall into a disadvantage when it came to morale and face. The Alliance of All responded to the declaration, and they started to target the human race. The human race was banned from entering the territory of any race in the Alliance of All or they would be sentenced to death!

…

Nature Sacred Ground.

After he left the hall, he went to An Nanjing, “Where are we going?”

“Come with me!” As soon as she finished speaking, she vanished into the sky.

“You still refuse to tell me?” Yang Ye shook his head and followed her.

In the starry sky, Yang Ye and An Nanjing traveled side by side. A day later, she stopped. At this moment, they had arrived on a planet. Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings, and he didn’t sense any signs of life.

Yang Ye gazed at An Nanjing. She didn’t say a word and just led him forward!

A long time passed before she stopped.

Yang Ye looked up, and he saw a cottage in the distance. It was made of grass, and it wasn’t large. It was just nice for a single person to live in.

Yang Ye asked, “What is this place?”

She still didn’t say a word and just walked over toward it. Yang Ye had no choice but to follow her.

It didn’t take long for her to arrive before it. She bowed slightly toward it, and roaring laughter came from within, “You’ve grown stronger again!”

As soon as the laughter finished resounding, a middle aged man walked out from the cottage.

The middle aged man’s face was covered in stubble, and he wore linen clothes. While it was very clean, he really looked quite shabby. If he was in the mortal world, he would look like a woodcutter. Of course, Yang Ye wouldn’t think he was a woodcutter. How proud was An Nanjing? Since he could make her bow to him, it was obvious that he wasn’t ordinary!

The middle aged man walked over to An Nanjing, sized her up, and then nodded, “Not bad indeed. Your natural talent is very good, and it’s just slightly inferior to mine. Haha…”

Yang Ye had quite a strange expression on his face. How terrifying was An Nanjing’s natural talent? But the middle aged man’s natural talent was greater than hers?

Meanwhile, An Nanjing gazed at him, “He’s telling the truth!”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

Meanwhile, the middle aged man gazed at Yang Ye, sized up Yang Ye, and shook his head, “Your natural talent is much inferior when compared to her.”

Yang Ye’s face darkened. Meanwhile, the middle aged man added, “However, you have something that she doesn’t possess, and it’s your character. That ruthless character of yours. Being ruthless to others is something anyone can accomplish, but being ruthless to oneself is something that very few in this world can accomplish. Anyone who can do that will never be a weakling.”

Yang Ye asked, “Senior, who are you?”

The middle aged man smiled, “Didn’t she tell you?”

Yang Ye shook his head.

The middle aged man smiled, “Come, I just happen to have roasted a plump goat. Let’s eat together.”

He walked into the cottage once he finished speaking.

An Nanjing gazed at Yang Ye, “Go in and eat!”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

As soon as Yang Ye stepped in, a fragrant aroma entered his nose. The cottage wasn’t very huge inside, and there was only a single bed in it. A fire was burning by the bed, and there was a golden and plump goat being roasted on it. The oil from the goat was ceaselessly dripping into the dire, causing hissing noises to resound incessantly.

It was really fragrant!

The middle aged man tore off one of its legs, and then he took a big bite out of it. He only chewed for a moment before swallowing it, and then he wiped off the oil on the corners of his mouth, “Help yourselves!”

An Nanjing tore off a leg and passed it to Yang Ye, “Eat!”

Yang Ye didn’t refuse and just started eating. Needless to say, it was really good. Just like that, they are in silence.

A long time passed, and then the middle aged man clapped his hands together and said, “You’ve come for a reason, right?”

An Nanjing nodded, “We want to grow stronger!”

The middle aged man said, “Speed isn’t everything!”

An Nanjing replied, “Find a way!”

The middle aged man shook his head, “You…”

He gazed at Yang Ye and said, “He uses the sword, so we’re not on the same path!”

An Nanjing replied, “Find a way!”

The middle aged man felt speechless, and so did Yang Ye.

A long time passed before the middle aged man spoke solemnly, “Regardless of whether it’s the Martial Dao or Sword Dao, it must be done step by step. Only then will it be the most solid and practical. Of course, I know it isn’t ordinary times right now.”

He stood up and said, “I can’t help you grow faster, but I can help your foundation grow even more solid.”

“Our foundation?” Yang Ye asked, “Is my foundation not solid?”

“Solid?” The middle aged man gazed at Yang Ye, “It’s really not bad when compared to some people, but as far as I’m concerned, it’s beyond trash!”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

The middle aged man gazed at An Nanjing and said, “She’s slightly better than you, but she’s lacking in many aspects too. However, it’s normal. I can’t say that I was any better at her age.”

An Nanjing put down the goat meat and fell silent.

The middle aged man continued, “Both of you are really not bad at all. Really. However, both of you have the same problem, you pursue breakthroughs too much. Especially you, kid from the Yang Clan. Your body and cultivation have huge problems. If this continues, it’ll be impossible for you to attain the Progenitor Realm. Even if you do succeed in the end, it’ll probably take countless years.”

Yang Ye glanced at the middle aged man, “Who are you?”

Suddenly, the middle aged man struck Yang Ye on the head.

.

It hurt!

Yang Ye instantly felt pain that stabbed at his heart, and he almost let out a shrill cry because of it.

The middle aged man said, “What? I can’t say anything about you without revealing my identity?”

Yang Ye felt speechless.

When he noticed the expression Yang Ye had on his face, the middle aged man suddenly said, “What? You’re not convinced?”

Yang Ye’s temper instantly flared. He leaped up and said, “I am! Let’s fight one on one!”

Meanwhile, An Nanjing suddenly said, “He’s my master!”

Your master? Yang Ye was stunned.

Meanwhile, the middle aged man suddenly pulled up his sleeves, “Come! Let’s fight one on one!”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.
