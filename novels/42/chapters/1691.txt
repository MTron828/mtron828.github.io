Chapter 1692 - Burn Phecda City To The Ground!

Yang Ye gazed at An Nanjing for a long time, and then he grinned, “You’re right. Our heart is one. It doesn’t matter even if all eight of the supreme clans join forces against us!”

Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!

Meanwhile, twelve black figures appeared behind Yang Shen.

The two black figures who led the group and held daggers in their hands were True Realm experts. As for the others by their sides, they were Zenith Realm experts.

Even though the Yang Clan was one of the eight clans, it still had very few True Realm experts. It wasn’t just the Yang Clan, it was the same for the other seven clans. So, Zenith Realm experts and Half-Step True Realm experts were the main forces of the various clans, and it was especially so for Zenith Realm experts.

True Realm experts were very difficult to foster while Zenith Realm and Half-Step True Realm experts were much easier to foster. Moreover, when Zenith Realm experts arrived at a certain number, they were capable of killing True Realm experts. Moreover, some Zenith Realm experts could kill True Realm experts on their own.

Of course, such people were quite rare.

These two True Realm experts combined with Yang Shen’s group of three made there a total of five True Realm experts present here right now. Besides the five True Realm experts, there were the survivors from the 72 warriors. Only nine of them remained now. So, if they were included with the ten Zenith Realm experts in black who had just arrived, there were a total of 19 Zenith Realm experts here!

Five True Realm experts and 19 Zenith Realm experts!

Needless to say, it was quite a force!

Meanwhile, Qiong Qi spoke abruptly, “Kid, do you have more trump cards?!”

Yang Ye gazed at Qiong Qi and shook his head, “I don’t think I do.”

Qiong Qi fell silent for a short while and said, “Kid, no matter what, we can be considered as friends. So, while I want to flee, I can’t. I can’t help with much. I’ll take two True Realm experts. You deal with the rest!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he charged at Yang Shen and the old man by Yang Shen’s side.

Yang Ye withdrew his gaze, and then he looked at An Nanjing. She was about to speak when Yang Ye said, “I’ll fight two True Realm experts. You take the last True Realm expert and those Zenith Realm experts, alright?”

An Nanjing nodded slightly, and then she pointed her spear at Yang Ling, “Come!”

As soon as she finished speaking, her figure shot over 10km to the left.

Yang Ling’s face turned icy cold from being provoked like that, and he spoke indifferently, “I alone am enough!”

As he spoke, he tapped his right foot down and vanished on the spot. In an instant, a loud explosion resounded from over 10km to the left.

Meanwhile, there were two True Realm experts and 19 Zenith Realm experts in front of Yang Ye.

Yang Ye fell silent for a moment, and then he suddenly took a step forward. He pointed his sword at the two True Realm experts in black clothes and said, “I’ll fight both of you on my own. Of course, if you’re afraid, you can tell the others behind you to help you!”

The black clothes figure who led the ground nodded slightly and said, “Alright!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he and the other black clothed figure by his side had simultaneously vanished on the spot. After that, numerous afterimages appeared here. The afterimages surrounded Yang Ye, and the 10 black clothed Zenith Realm experts vanished on the spot as well.

Yang Ye’s face fell. He’d hoped to provoke them into fighting him two on one, and it would have been best if it was one on one. However, he hadn’t expected them to actually not fall for it and gang up on him!

Two True Realm experts and 19 Zenith Realm experts!

Yang Ye fell silent for a moment, and then he swiftly swung his sword horizontally.

Om!

A flaming ray of sword energy flashed out from the tip of the wooden sword!

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!

Everywhere it passed, numerous afterimages were obliterated, and the two True Realm experts were pushed back repeatedly as well. However, they were able to stop themselves without being pushed back very far, and then they shot forward again.

Meanwhile, the remaining Zenith Realm experts had arrived around Yang Ye, and then numerous rays of cold light flashed and shot like blades towards Yang Ye.

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings. He stomped his right foot against the ground and transformed into a ray of light that shot towards one of the Zenith Realm experts.

At this moment, he couldn’t go on the defensive at all. Once he did that, he would lose the initiative, and then he would suffer a storm of attacks.

It was just like any other fight. If one was facing a group of enemies, then one could absolutely not go on the defensive. Because that would only cause one to lose the initiative and have no choice but to passively suffer attacks. So, the only way to avoid that was to target someone and aim to kill.

Killing one made them even, killing a second was profit!

The black clothed figures and the 72 warriors were Zenith Realm experts who’d attained the Zenith Realm without relying on any external forces. However, the Zenith Realm was utterly insufficient to face Yang Ye’s current strength, and only Zenith Realm experts, who could surmount their realms of cultivation to fight True Realm experts, stood a chance against Yang Ye.

So, once Yang Ye targeted someone, that person was dead. That was exactly what happened in reality. A ray of light flashed, and then the head of a black clothed figure flew up into the air while accompanied by a fountain of blood. However, numerous injuries from blades appeared on Yang Ye’s body as well. In just an instant, he’d suffered at least 10 blade injuries.

Fortunately, he’d prevented them from hitting any vital spots!

After he killed a Zenith Realm expert, Yang Ye stomped his right foot against the ground and transformed into a shadow that vanished on the spot. He was behind another Zenith Realm expert when his figure appeared again, and then a ray of light flashed.

Hiss!

The head of that Zenith Realm expert flew up into the air. However, a few more rays of cold light had appeared around him. At the same time, a few golden arrows were following closely behind the rays of cold light. The arrows were especially dangerous because they were shot at extremely tricky and ruthless angles. Moreover, their targets were his eyes and various other vital spots.

Yang Ye didn’t dare to let them strike his vital points. After all, they could pierce his physical defenses.

Yang Ye immediately issued a command in his heart, and a black shield appeared in front of him. After that, it transformed into a black ray of light that shot forward.

Rumble!

Along with a string of explosions, the arrows were blasted away by the black shield. However, a black clothed figure suddenly appeared behind Yang Ye, and then a ray of cold light shot towards Yang Ye’s nape.

A True Realm expert!

Yang Ye didn’t dare to act carelessly. He turned around and swung his sword. But at the exact same moment that he turned around, numerous rays of light instantly struck his back, causing blood to spray.

The wooden sword descended.

Bang!

A loud explosion resounded, and Yang Ye was blasted 3km away. As soon as he stopped himself, another black clothed figure appeared behind him, and then a ray of cold light instantly arrived behind his head.

Yang Ye’s pupils constricted slightly when he sensed the attack coming from behind him. He couldn’t be bothered to take a look at his injuries, and he just immediately turned around and swung his sword.

Bang! Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

The black clothed figure’s dagger was instantly obliterated, and then the force of the collision pushed him back repeatedly. Meanwhile, Yang Ye’s figure was pushed backwards repeatedly as well!

However, just after being pushed around 30m back, another black clothed figure appeared behind him, and then another ray of cold light arrived behind his head. Moreover, a few golden arrows suddenly tore through the air and arrived before him! Every single one of them was aimed at a vital point!

A vicious glow flashed through Yang Ye’s eyes. He issued a command in his heart, and the pitch black shield flew over to stop the arrows while he instantly executed a horizontal sweep with his sword. In an instant, a crescent shaped wave of sword energy swept forward.

Bang! Bang!

The sword energy obliterated everything before it. However, the aftershock from the collision between his sword energy and the incoming attacks pushed him backwards repeatedly. At the same time, blood ceaselessly seeped out from the corner of his mouth. Besides that, his entire body had cracked open, and there were many injuries caused by blades and arrows throughout his body.

It could be said that if the Primordial Violet Energy within him wasn’t ceaselessly repairing his body, then he would be dead by now.

Besides his own will, the reason he was still standing and could still fight was the Primordial Violet Energy within him. It was ceaselessly keeping him alive and preventing his wounds from being life threatening. Otherwise, even ten wooden swords wouldn’t be able to save him.

Because he would be dead!

As soon as Yang Ye stopped himself, the Zenith Realm and True Realm experts around him had vanished on the spot once more. In an instant, numerous afterimages appeared in the surroundings, and they descended upon Yang Ye in waves.

Yang Ye wiped off the blood on the corner of his mouth, and then he withdrew two Energy Pearls and swallowed them. The profound energy within him was instantly replenished while he glanced at the surroundings. At this moment, those experts were in front of him.

He fell silent for a moment, and then a wisp of viciousness flashed through his eyes. A moment later, a strand of flames suddenly swept out from within him!

The Divine Yin Flames!

This time, he stopped using the Divine Yin Flame’s strength, and he allowed it to use his strength and attack on its own instead!

Using the Divine Yin Flame and allowing it to attack on its own were two completely different concepts, and the injuries he suffered were completely different as well. However, he had no other choice now, and he could only let it use his body to attack.

As for whether his body could endure its strength, he couldn’t be bothered about that any longer.

If he was going to die, it was better to drag some people down with him than die alone!

Once the Divine Yin Flame swept out, the temperature in Phecda City instantly skyrocketed. At the same time, the space around Yang Ye started to become more and more ethereal.

Bang!

A moment later, the space around him collapsed. The Zenith Realm experts around him were instantly swallowed within the Divine Yin Flames, and only those two True Realm experts retreated incessantly.

Yang Ye’s face was extremely warped at this moment. Instead of calling it warped, it should be called ferocious. He gazed at the sky while ferocity covered his face, “Burn! Burn Phecda City to the ground!”

As soon as he finished speaking, the Divine Yin Flame suddenly exploded apart, and it transformed into countless tongues of flames that shot towards Phecda City. Everything in its wake was incinerated, and even space ceased to exist!
