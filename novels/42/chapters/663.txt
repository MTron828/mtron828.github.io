Chapter 664 – She’s Dead!

Based on what that expert from the Hallowed Grounds said just now, Yang Ye knew that the man hidden in the arc of light was a defiant profounder of legend. He was rather surprised by this because he hadn’t expected that they’d actually emerged from the seal and arrived at Profounder Continent. At the same time, he witnessed how terrifying they were!

The defiant profounder before him was only at the Monarch Realm, but he’d been able to heavily injure Xuan Kong with ease! As for those ordinary Monarch Realm experts, they were actually only able to resist a few moves from him at most.

He’s strong! Very strong!But so what?In any case, it’s in my possession, so I absolutely refuse to hand it over!

The violet sword qi and Qin Bufan’s arc of light smashed against each other, and then a moment of silence ensued before both of them exploded in midair. The formidable waves of energy emanated from the point of collision caused both of them to be blasted over 1km away before they were able to avoid being struck by the aftershock.

“Eh?” An exclaim resounded from within the arc of light, “A mere Exalt Realm profounder actually possesses such strength. That’s quite surprising. Out of consideration for the fact that we joined forces against that old dog just now, hand over the Stone of Suppression and I’ll let bygones be bygones. Otherwise, you’ll die!”

Yang Ye stretched out his hand and made a grasping motion. An intent sword instantly condensed in his grasp. At the same time, over a dozen extreme-grade energy stones appeared in his pockets before ceaselessly emanating energy which surged into him. “I’ll take the fact that we joined forces just now into consideration as well. So you can leave, and I won’t stop you. Otherwise, you’ll die!”

“I can’t be killed!” A voice resounded from within the arc of light.

“But your strength will definitely plummet with every death you experience, right?” said Yang Ye. He wasn’t confident in his ability to kill Qin Bufan because while Qin Bufan was at the Monarch Realm, he was probably a Half-Saint in the past. However, Yang Ye was only at the Exalt Realm.

No further words resounded from within the arc of light, and it was just fluctuating without end.

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly while the last remaining profound energy within him surged madly as he gazed vigilantly at the arc of light.

Bang!

Right at this moment, rumbling suddenly resounded from afar. Yang Ye was delighted when he looked over because another Half-Saint from the Hallowed Grounds had fallen.

“Leave! Everyone leave!” Xuan Ming’s anxious voice resounded. The remaining Half-Saints didn’t dare stay any longer when they heard him, and they transformed into rays of light that shot towards the distance.

The Demon Saint was about to pursue when Elder Mu waved his hand and said, “Don’t pursue them.”

The Demon Saint and the others were slightly stunned, and then they nodded. Even though the southern territory had killed a few Half-Saints, it had suffered heavy losses as well. Those that survived were heavily injured, and that even included Elder Mu. So even if they could kill those Half-Saints by pursuing them now, they would definitely suffer heavy losses!

“Are you sure that you don’t want to leave?” Yang Ye gazed at the arc of light as he spoke in a low voice.

“Just you wait! Not just anyone can steal from me, Qin Bufan!” A voice resounded from within the arc of light, and then an absorbing force suddenly surged out from within it. All the corpses of the Half-Saints and Monarch Realm experts in the sky instantly transformed into rays of light that entered the arc of light before it flickered a few times and vanished in the horizon.

Yang Ye’s profound energy slowed down to a stop when he saw Qin Bufan leave, and his expression was very solemn as he gazed in the direction that it had vanished towards.

Because the defiant profounders were much more terrifying than the Hallowed Grounds!

There were over 10,000 defiant profounders being sealed within the Hallowed Grounds, and if all of them were to escape the seal, then not to mention the Hallowed Grounds, even the joint forces of the entire continent and the Hallowed Grounds would probably be unable to resist them!

The defiant profounders might be his enemies yet might not. However, he had no choice but to consider the worst case scenario!

“That was a defiant profounder?” The Demon Saint gazed at the direction that the arc of light had vanished towards as he asked this question in a heavy voice. Moreover, there was a serious expression in his eyes.

“He should be one!” said Elder Mu.

“He’s very strong!” said the Demon Saint.

Elder Mu suddenly stated, “He isn’t the strongest!”

The Demon Saint, Yang Ye, and the others revealed solemn expressions in response to this.

The Demon Saint said, “There are even stronger defiant profounders?”

Elder Mu nodded and said, “I’ve never been to the Hallowed Grounds, but I possess some knowledge about the defiant profounders. According to rumor, some of them possess all sorts of inconceivable techniques. Just like that defiant profounder from before. Every single one of the techniques he executed were above the Dao Rank at least. In short, this world is growing more and more chaotic!”

“Elder Mu, are you alright?” Yang Ye’s voice was filled with worry as he gazed at the state of Elder Mu’s chest. At the same time, he felt quite guilty. After all, Elder Mu wasn’t related to all of this at all, but Elder Mu had been swept into it because of him. The old man who stood before him had done too much for him, but he wasn’t able to do anything for Elder Mu!

The Primordial Violet Energy within him could help Elder Mu attain the Saint Realm, but the problem was that the Primordial Violet Energy he possessed was utterly insufficient. Moreover, once he exposed the fact that he possessed it, it wouldn’t be just the experts of the continent who would go mad with desire, even the Hallowed Grounds and defiant profounders would go mad. At that time, he would truly have no chance at survival.

So, he was utterly unable and dared not expose the Primordial Violet Energy within the Primordial Pagoda until he possessed absolute strength.

Elder Mu glanced at his chest before he shook his head, “It isn’t life threatening.” He gazed at Yang Ye and continued, “The Monarch Realm experts of our southern territory have either died or suffered injuries. Besides a few people, everyone else isn’t able to fight again in the near future. On the other hand, the Demon Saint, Demon Emperor, and I have to enter into closed door cultivation to recuperate. So, you’ll have to rely on yourself to deal with most things!”

Yang Ye nodded and said, “Seniors, recuperate well. Just leave everything else to me. I’ll unify the entire continent as soon as possible!”

Elder Mu nodded and said, “You have the Stone of Suppression, so you should be able to protect your life even if you encounter a Half-Saint. However, you can’t be careless, especially when you’re up against the defiant profounders. As for the Hallowed Grounds, they would absolutely not dare to dispatch any more Half-Saints to the Profounder Continent now that they’ve lost possession of that stone. Of course, it would be a completely different story if they’re willing to sacrifice Half-Saints to destroy the seal between the Hallowed Grounds and Profounder Continent!” T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Elder Mu’s figure flashed and vanished on the spot once he finished speaking.

“Take good care of Zi’er!” said the Demon Emperor before he vanished with the Demon Saint.

At the same time, the Founding Emperor, Beast Emperor, Xiao Tianji, and the others vanished as well.

Yang Ye took a deep breath, and then he looked towards the direction of the Exalted Han Empire and the devil race because he felt that it was time for them to vanish from the continent. Even though the Devil Saint had changed sides and attacked the Hallowed Grounds just now, it still wasn’t sufficient to make him spare the devil race or oceanic clans!

An Nanjing had almost died, and even slaughtering both the devil race and oceanic clans wouldn’t be sufficient to vent the hatred in his heart!

“She’s dead!” Suddenly, a woman appeared behind Yang Ye. Yang Ye turned around and was slightly stunned because it was An Biru.
