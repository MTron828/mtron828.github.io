Chapter 1777 – A Head!

The black robed old man had an extremely unsightly expression on his face.

After all, he couldn’t even fight back against a junior…

Needless to say, he was truly shocked by Yang Ye’s strength. At this moment, he understood why the Ying Clan’s coalition had sent so many experts to pursue Yang Ye.

This fellow was no ordinary expert!

A moment of silence ensued, and then the old man gazed at Yang Ye, “I underestimated you!”

Yang Ye chuckled, “It’s fine, I don’t mind. Old man, I’ve never intended to become enemies with your Secret Sect. Since I’m not welcome here, I’m not shameless enough to stay. I’ll leave now!”

He turned around and walked away once he finished speaking.

Meanwhile, the black robed old man suddenly said, “Young Brother, I’m sorry if what I said offended you. I hope you don’t take it to heart. Right, my Secret Sect warmly welcomes you.”

Yang Ye stopped and turned to look at the old man. He smiled, “Senior, what are you saying? Do I look like someone who’s petty? No, everyone who knows me is aware that I’m extremely magnanimous!”

The corners of the old man’s mouth twitched slightly. Magnanimous? I really didn’t notice!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye added, “I was going to leave, but since the Secret Sect is so welcoming, wouldn’t I be disrespectful to the Secret Sect if I left now? So, I can’t leave! I have to stay!”

The black robed old man and Yun Qian really wanted to hit him right now!

Just like that, Yang Ye stayed behind.

He traveled with the old man and Yun Qian to the mountain from before.

The old man suddenly said, “Actually, this can’t be considered to be the Secret Sect.”

Yang Ye asked, “It’s just the outer area?”

The old man nodded, “Come, let’s head up there!”

As soon as he finished speaking, his figure soared up into the sky and towards the mountain peak. Yang Ye and Yun Qian followed closely behind the old man. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

It didn’t take long for them to arrive at the top of the mountain. Yang Ye was quite shocked when he arrived here.

There were numerous luxurious palaces here. There were quite a few of them, but the main point was that they were extremely huge.

Yang Ye gazed at the old man, “This is just the outer area of the Secret Sect?”

The old man nodded, “This is where the outer court disciples reside. Come, let me take you to the Sect Master.”

He vanished into the distance.

Yang Ye and Yun Qian immediately followed after him.

In next to no time, the black robed old man led them to a teleportation platform, and then they appeared in a gorge.

The gorge wasn’t very large, and it was surrounded by mountains. There was a palace far in the depths of the gorge. It wasn’t very large, but it felt ancient.

At the same time, Yang Ye sensed numerous concealed auras, and they were extremely powerful!

The Secret Sect isn’t ordinary at all! Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings and became slightly more vigilant.

In next to no time, they entered the palace, but it was empty.

The old man said, “Wait a moment! The Sect Master will be here shortly!”

Yang Ye nodded and glanced at the surroundings. It wasn’t very large, but the hall was covered in strange symbols.

A formation!

There was a formation in the hall!

Suddenly, a middle aged man appeared in the hall.

Yang Ye’s expression became extremely solemn when he saw the middle aged man. The 6th stage of the True Realm!

Moreover, while the middle aged man was at the 6th stage of the True Realm, just like Yang Xiang, the middle aged man’s aura was much stronger!

It was the Secret Sect’s Master, Su Mu!

Su Mu gazed at Yang Ye. A long time passed before he nodded slightly, “Not bad!”

Not bad!

The black robed old man’s expression changed slightly when he heard Su Mu. That’s a really high evaluation!

After all, the Sect Master of the Secret Sect had been an extraordinary genius in the past, and he was extremely picky. Not to mention in the outside world, even some of the extraordinary geniuses in the Secret Sect were below his standards!

Yet now, he said Yang Ye was not bad!

But it was normal. Because if even Yang Ye was below his standards, then his standards would be absolutely unusual.

Meanwhile, Su Mu suddenly waved his right hand, and then the wooden sword in Yang Ye’s grasp flew over to him. There was a wisp of complicated emotions in his eyes as he gazed at the wooden sword, “Do you know its origins?”

Yang Ye shook his head in response.

Su Mu replied, “Actually, even I don’t know the answer. All I know is that it fell down from the sky!”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “It fell down from the sky?”

Su Mu nodded slightly, “It fell down with something else.”

“Something else?” Yang Ye asked, “What else?”

Su Mu fell silent for a moment and replied, “A head!”

“A head!” Yang Ye frowned, “Can you give me a bit more details?”

Su Mu nodded, “Many years ago, something fell from the sky, and it was that head and this sword. This sword was stabbed into the head. In the beginning, the seniors of my Secret Sect thought the head was dead, but it was actually still alive!”

It was alive!

Yang Ye asked, “What do you mean?”

Su Mu shook his head slightly, “This sword was suppressing the head. In the beginning, it was still able to manage that, but as time passed, the head grew stronger while it weakened. Because during its fight with the head, the head sealed it instead….”

“It was sealed?” Yang Ye was astounded, “So, even its true form can’t defeat that head?”

Su Mu replied, “You have to realize that it’s just a sword. No matter how strong it is, its strength is limited without someone using it. But that head definitely doesn’t belong to an ordinary person. Because even 6th stage True Realm experts were practically incapable of fighting back against it, and that was even during the time that it was being suppressed!”

He paused for a moment and continued, “My Secret Sect intended to ignore the sword and head, but in the end, we had no choice but to deal with it. Because someone from the large universe sent word that my Secret Sect must help the sword suppress the head!”

Yang Ye asked, “Why didn’t they come down here themselves?”

“They can’t!” Su Mu continued, “There’s a difference in strength even between ancient cultivators. For some unknown reason, the strongest amongst them set up powerful barriers around the three universes in the Milky Way System. We can’t head down to the small universe, and they can’t come down to the medium universe. Of course, not everyone is unable to come down here. For example, those ancient cultivators who set up the barrier should be able to come down here!”

Yang Ye nodded . The old man in Daoist’s robes was probably one of the strongest because he’d come down, and it had even been a clone of his…. As for Xiao Qi and the others, it may be because of the Primordial Pagoda.

Meanwhile, Su Mu said, “Since they wanted us to help this sword suppress the head, it naturally came with benefits. The benefit was that they would use a special method to send down some powerful cultivation techniques and combat techniques every five years.”

He gazed at Yang Ye and continued, “This can be considered the main reason why my Secret Sect is so strong! However, later on, we noticed that the head’s strength surpassed our imagination. Coupled with the fact that the sword was sealed by it, if our Sect Master wasn’t close friends with the Wu Clan’s Wu Mu and gained his help, my Secret Sect may have vanished from the word!”

Wu Mu! Yang Ye hadn’t imagined that Wu Mu had actually come here and helped the Secret Sect. But it did make sense because the sword had been in the Wu Clan, so it was definitely linked to the Wu Clan.

Meanwhile, Su Mu continued, “However, even an extraordinary genius like Wu Mu wasn’t able to destroy that head. In the end, Wu Mu was only able to join forces with the experts of my Secret Sect and seal the head. He took the sword with him in the hopes that he could find a powerful sword cultivator to help unseal it.”

Yang Ye spoke in a low voice, “My current strength isn’t sufficient to unseal the wooden sword!”

The wooden sword had to absorb powerful sword energy to undo the seal, but his current sword intent wasn’t sufficient!

Su Mu nodded, “I noticed!”

Yang Ye’s face darkened. This fellow really doesn’t have a way with words!

Meanwhile, Su Mu added, “but since it has chosen to follow you, there’s definitely something extraordinary about you.”

Something extraordinary? Yang Ye shook his head. It would definitely not follow me if it wasn’t for the Primordial Pagoda and Snowy!

“Right!” Yang Ye suddenly said, “Why didn’t you try to move the head somewhere else? Why keep it in the Secret Sect?”

Su Mu laughed bitterly, “It’s pointless. My Secret Sect helped this sword seal him, so his hatred towards my Secret Sect is beyond your imagination. Once he escapes, the first he’ll annihilate is my Secret Sect!”

“True!” Yang Ye nodded. It hadn’t been the Secret Sect’s business, but the Secret Sect had helped the wooden sword seal the head in order to gain benefits. So, anyone in such a situation would feel resentful.

Meanwhile, Su Mu said, “After so many years, the seal which Wu Mu left behind has started to weaken. It won’t be long before the seal vanishes completely. So, I asked Yun Qian to find the wooden sword and bring it back. We have no choice this time, and the wooden sword doesn’t have a choice either. We can only fight it to the death!”

Yang Ye glanced at Su Mu. If he was being honest, he wanted to flee right now. He didn’t want to get involved in the enmity between the Secret Sect and that head. After all, since it had fallen from the sky, it was obviously not something normal!

“Actually, there was a person who could kill the head!” Su Mu spoke softly, “Unfortunately, that person refused to do so!”

Yang Ye asked, “Who?”

Su Mu replied, “A sword cultivator, a powerful sword cultivator.”

A sword cultivator? Yang Ye was stunned, and it didn’t take long for him to think of a certain person!
