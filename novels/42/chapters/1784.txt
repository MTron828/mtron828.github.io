Chapter 1785 – My Style Is Laying Low?

Seizing control of his body!

The head wanted to seize control of Yang Ye’s body. But what did Yang Ye fear the least? Others trying to seize control of his body!

Because the Primordial Pagoda resided within him, so it could be said that his mind and soul were protected by it, and the only way to seize control of his body was to first destroy the Primordial Pagoda.

In the past, he didn’t have a clear understanding of the Primordial Pagoda, but he had one now. The Primordial Pagoda was a treasure from the large universe, and it was an absolutely formidable one. In short, he was very confident in it.

The head before him was absolutely incapable of destroying the Primordial Pagoda. At the very least, he couldn’t right now.

As for why he’d resisted earlier, it was because he didn’t want the head to be suspicious. After all, any normal person would resist under such circumstances. If he didn’t and just allowed the head to seize control of him, then it was very likely for the head to become suspicious.

At that time, the head would kill him first before taking his body, and he would be in trouble then!

In order to prevent the head from getting suspicious, Yang Ye had fought back. But he hadn’t used all his trump cards.

Now, the head had entered his sea of consciousness.

Right when the head was about to seize control, a wave of powerful energy transported it into the Primordial Pagoda.

The head was stunned when he arrived in the Primordial Pagoda. He sized up the surroundings, “Where am I?”

Suddenly, Qiong Qi appeared in front of him and shot an indifferent glance at him, “Why don’t you try guessing?”

The head gazed at Qiong Qi and frowned. Suddenly, his eyes opened wide, “Qiong Qi! You’re one of the four demon kings, Qiong Qi! What… what are you doing here?”

Qiong Qi repeated, “Why don’t you try guessing?”

The head’s expression changed. Suddenly, he frowned again, “No! This isn’t your main body, it’s a clone!”

Qiong Qi glanced indifferently at him and just laid down on the ground.

The head’s face turned cold from being ignored, and a wave of powerful aura swept down at Qiong Qi.

Qiong Qi raised his claw and slapped it forward.

Bang!

As soon as the two forces collided with each other, a loud explosion resounded. The head was about to attack again, but Qiong Qi spoke abruptly, “If I were you, I’d lay low.”

“Lay low? Is laying low my style?” The head grunted coldly, and then a wave of evil energy appeared here. This time, Qiong Qi didn’t do anything and just laid there. Right when the energy was about to slam against Qiong Qi, a wave of powerful energy descended from the sky and slammed against the evil energy.

Boom!

A loud explosion resounded, and the evil energy was obliterated in an instant.

The head’s expression changed. He looked up at the sky, and then a solemn expression appeared on his face. A short while later, he gazed at Qiong Qi, “Why can’t I sense outer space or the Laws of all things? What is this place?!”

Qiong Qi glanced at the head, closed his eyes, and didn’t say a word.

Suddenly, a ray of white light flashed, and then Snowy appeared before them with the wooden sword in her arms.

Snowy gazed at the head and blinked repeatedly while curiosity filled her eyes.

The head’s expression turned ferocious when he saw the wooden sword, and then a wave of powerful energy slammed down towards Snowy and the wooden sword.

Snowy’s eyes opened wide at the sight of this. Obviously, she hadn’t expected that the head would attack her.

As for Qiong Qi, he opened his eyes and glanced at the head, and there was a trace of pity in his gaze.

It was a horrible idea to offend Snowy and Zi’er in the Primordial Pagoda because both of them were very close to the pagoda. Perhaps it may not help Yang Ye, but the Primordial Pagoda would definitely help the two little fellows!

Sure enough, as soon as the head attacked, a wave of powerful energy descended from the sky. In the end, it slammed against the head.

Bang!

Boom!

The head was blasted over 10km away and crashed against the ground. As soon as it hit the ground, the ground in a huge area cracked apart like an earthquake was running through it.

The head was quite stunned. Suddenly, another wave of energy descended and slammed against the head.

Boom!

The head was blasted over 10km away again!

However, it wasn’t the end of it. Another wave of energy descended from the sky. This time, the head shot up into the sky, and then a wave of powerful force swept out from within it. In an instant, the space throughout the sky shook violently and seemed like it would collapse at any moment!

Qiong Qi shook his head, “Go on! Continue!”

A moment of silence ensued in the sky, and then numerous waves of powerful energy descended from the sky. They instantly arrived above the head.

Boom!

As soon as they came in contact with the energy emanated from the head, the head’s energy was instantly obliterated before those waves of energy slammed against the head.

Bang!

The head crashed down from the sky, and it only took a moment for it to be smashed into the ground.

Snowy gazed at Qiong Qi and pointed at the head. It seemed like she was asking what the head was doing.

Qiong Qi glanced at Snowy and said, “He’s defying the heavens!”

Snowy blinked and started waving her claws about.

Qiong Qi gazed at her for a long time and said, “I don’t know what you’re talking about!”

Snowy was stunned speechless.

Rumble!

Suddenly, numerous explosions resounded from afar. The head was being blasted all over by waves of mysterious energy.

It was because the head had actually tried to forcefully break through the space here, and that had clearly infuriated the Primordial pagoda. The consequences of infuriating the Primordial pagoda was very severe.

In a secret room in the world outside.

Lin Weiyang and the others stared at Yang Ye’s figure on the screen without blinking at all. Ling Xiu slowly started to frown, “What’s going on? Why hasn’t there been any movement from him?”

Su Mu was about to say something when Yang Ye’s face started to warp. That wasn’t all, even his body started to tremble violently as if he was enduring some sort of terrible pain!

Ling Xiu’s frown gradually vanished when she saw this. Because that was a normal reaction! 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

In the Primordial Pagoda.

The torture was still going on!

The Primordial Pagoda hadn’t stopped, and wave after wave of powerful energy descended incessantly from the sky and slammed against the head. During this period, the head tried to fight back, but it was in vain. Moreover, the head actually started to turn ethereal under the Primordial Pagoda’s incessant attacks.

Meanwhile, Qiong Qi said, “If I were you, I’d admit my mistakes.”

The head spoke ferociously, “Admit my mistakes? Besides the Lord Shaman King, who can make me admit my mistakes?!”

Another wave of powerful energy slammed down against the top of his head.

Bang!

He was slammed over 10km away.

Qiong Qi nodded, “You have backbone!”

Another 15 minutes later, the head suddenly flew up into the air. Right when Qiong Qi thought the head was going to risk everything to fight back, he suddenly said, “Stop! That’s enough! I… I admit my mistakes! I admit I was wrong!”

Qiong Qi was stunned speechless.

The sky gradually calmed down once the head finished speaking.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye appeared here. It was naturally not his main body but a clone.

Yang Ye gazed at the head, “Hey! We meet again!”

The head’s face instantly became extremely gloomy when he saw Yang Ye, “You wanted me to come inside from the beginning, and you only resisted so that I would come in here, right?”

Yang Ye nodded, “Exactly!”

The head gazed at Yang Ye for a long time before he said, “Very good. I didn’t expect that I would be tricked by a child. Very good!” He glanced at the surroundings and asked, “What is this place? Who attacked me just now?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “I refuse to answer that!”

The head’s eyes narrowed slightly. He gazed at Yang Ye for quite some time, and then he said, “Kid, no matter what this place is, let me go and I’ll let bygones be bygones. Otherwise….”

Suddenly, Yang Ye shrugged and interrupted the head, “I think that you should adjust your mentality. Otherwise, we won’t be able to communicate well.”

The head stared at Yang Ye, “What are you trying to say?”

Yang Ye smiled, “It’s very simple!”

The smile on Yang Ye’s face suddenly vanished, “You should be thinking about how to stop me from killing you. Or how to make me not want to kill you. That’s what you should be thinking about right now!”

“You want to kill me!” A wisp of ridicule curled up on the corners of the head’s mouth, “Nothing in this universe can kill me. Even that sword in your grasp can’t kill me!”

Yang Ye nodded, “I want to give it a try!”

Yang Ye waved his hand once he finished speaking.

Bang!

A powerful wave of energy slammed down against the head.

Boom!

The head was blasted over 10km away. However, that wasn’t the end of it. Wave after wave of energy appeared in succession!

Around 15 minutes later, the head’s voice suddenly resounded, “Kid, stop. Make it stop. Let’s discuss things. Let’s discuss things….”

Qiong Qi nodded, “You really do have backbone!”

Around half an hour later.

Yang Ye suddenly opened his eyes in the core of the mountain.

As soon as he did, Lin Weiyang and the others had solemn expressions on their faces.

Suddenly, Yang Ye took a deep breath and spoke fiercely, “I’m finally free! HAHAHA!”
