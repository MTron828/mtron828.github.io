Chapter 1833 – An Enlightened Realm Expert!

The Nether Abyss.

After he entered the Nether Abyss, Yang Ye felt like he’d lost his center of balance and was descending rapidly.

He glanced at the surroundings, and he could sense that the mountain walls behind him were shaking. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Suddenly, Blood Maiden said, “Be careful!”

Yang Ye was about to say something when Nether Dream spoke abruptly, “Don’t worry. His skin is thick. A fall can’t kill him!”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

Suddenly, Blood Maiden’s expression changed, “Watch out!”

As soon as she finished speaking, numerous black circles of light appeared around Nether Dream. Meanwhile, a few dozen tree roots that were over 300m long appeared around them. A moment later, those roots had enveloped them completely.

Rumble!

Explosions resounded incessantly in the abyss.

A short while passed before the area suddenly fell silent.

The roots around them had vanished, but they still had extremely solemn expressions on their faces.

Because they hadn’t made the roots vanish, and the roots had just vanished into thin air.

Yang Ye asked, “What was that?”

Blood Maiden shook her head slightly, “I don’t know!” She frowned, “Boundary Maiden went through space and came here once, but she didn’t encounter these things.!

Yang Ye was quite surprised, “Boundary Maiden has been here?”

Blood Maiden nodded, “She can set a point and teleport there. However, because her cultivation is too low, she can only teleport herself. There’s a barrier down below, and it surpasses the limits of her ability. So, we had no choice but to seek your help!”

“So someone has really been here….” Meanwhile, Nether Dream suddenly said, “I felt something was quite off that day, but I didn’t find anything when I searched.”

Blood Maiden said, “Fortunately, you didn’t!” Because if Nether Dream had found Boundary Maiden, then she would definitely die.

Blind Maiden said, “Let’s head down there!”

The others nodded and descended in succession.

Around an hour later, they finally reached the bottom.

The surroundings were covered in mist, and it was impossible to see the surroundings clearly.

Meanwhile, Nether Dream waved his right hand. In an instant, the surrounding mist started swirling, and then they slowly floated upwards. It didn’t take long for the mist to vanish from their field of vision.

At this moment, the surroundings were clear.

However, it was still impossible to see anything before them.

Yang Ye gazed at Blood Maiden. Meanwhile, the latter said, “A barrier. This area is covered by a barrier.”

A barrier! Yang Ye nodded and gazed at Nether Dream, “Can you break it open?”

Blood Maiden and Blind Maiden gazed at Nether Dream as well.

She was the strongest amongst them.

Nether Dream gazed forward for a long time, and then she shook her head, “She set it up, so I can’t break it open.”

She suddenly gazed at Yang Ye, “That sword and flame of yours might be able to do it!”

Yang Ye nodded. He glanced at the wooden sword, and then he stabbed it forward.

Bang!

An explosion resounded, and then space shook violently as if an earthquake was surging through the surroundings.

But it only took a moment for the surroundings to return to calm once more. The area around them was still impossible to see through.

However, there was a fine hole where the tip of Yang Ye’s wooden sword was. Moreover, the space there wasn’t like the space around them. The space there was slightly translucent.

“It does work!” A smile curled up on the corners of Blood Maiden’s face.

Yang Ye gazed at Blood Maiden, and the latter said, “Again!”

Yang Ye nodded, and then he circulated the profound energy within him before raising his sword and stabbing again.

Just like that, the space there grew more and more ethereal as Yang Ye swung his sword, over and over again.

Around two hours later…

Boom!

An explosion resounded, and then Yang Ye was blasted away by a powerful wave of energy. However, the space in the surroundings suddenly became ethereal.

In just a short while, the space here started to return to normal, and then an ancient tree which was around 300m tall appeared before them.

A tree? All of them were stunned.

Meanwhile, Blood Maiden suddenly said, “Be careful!”

Yang Ye nodded. Something felt very off about this damnable place. It could be said that if he hadn’t improved his cultivation in the body to the Blood Rebirth level, he would have turned around and left. This place wasn’t a place he could be!

Even now, he felt quite apprehensive!

Suddenly, the ancient tree started to tremble.

Yang Ye tightened his grip on his sword and became vigilant.

Meanwhile, Hou Qing’s voice resounded in Yang Ye’s head, “Kid, that tree isn’t ordinary!”

Yang Ye spoke solemnly, “Senior, that’s obvious. Can you tell me what’s extraordinary about it?!”

Hou Qing spoke in a low voice, “Kid, I think you’ve gotten yourself in big trouble.”

Yang Ye’s face darkened, “Stop trying to scare me!”

“He isn’t!” Qiong Qi’s voice resounded abruptly, “Kid, you’ve really gotten yourself in trouble by breaking that barrier.”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

Suddenly, numerous branches shot out like bolts of lightning. They were so swift that Yang Ye couldn’t even see them clearly!

At the exact same moment, Nether Dream flicked with her finger, and a black circle of light flashed out.

Boom!

An explosion resounded. Yang Ye and Blood Maiden watched with astonishment as Nether Dream was blasted over 1km away!

Cold sweat emerged from Yang Ye’s forehead when he witnessed that.

Who was Nether Dream? He didn’t know her exact strength, but she was much stronger than him. However, she’d actually been pushed back!

Now, he understood what Qiong Qi and Hou Qing meant.

Yang Ye wasn’t the only one. Blood Maiden and Blind Maiden were stunned too. Obviously, they hadn’t expected Nether Dream to be pushed back!

Nether Dream looked up at the tree, and then she waved her hand. A huge circle of black light flashed out, and then it appeared above the tree. A moment later, an extremely terrifying wave of black energy surged out from it.

Suddenly, a branch shot up into the sky and slammed against the circle of black light.

Boom!

The circle of black light exploded into bits!

Yang Ye’s eyelids twitched. He walked over to Blood Maiden and said, “Second Sister, how about we retreat for now?”

Blood Maiden glanced at Yang Ye and shook her head, “We can’t leave until we figure out what happened.” She paused for a moment and continued, “However, you can go. I feel bad for dragging you into this. Now, the barrier is gone, so you don’t have to stay.”

Yang Ye laughed bitterly. He couldn’t just leave now.

Suddenly, a pitch black root shot out from the ancient tree. The root was over 3m thick, and there were over a dozen more following behind it. All of them were shooting at Nether Dream!

Nether Dream’s face turned icy cold. She waved her right hand, and then over a dozen circles of black light instantly appeared on her arm.

“The Nether Loop!” Suddenly, Blood Maiden said, “It’s ranked the third amongst the techniques of my Nether Pavilion. Because our pavilion master and her vanished, it was lost to us. I didn’t expect to see it again.”

The Nether Loop? Yang Ye gazed at Nether Dream. He’d suffered tremendously because of those circles of black light just now. Moreover, it was even able to suppress his sword intent and slaughter intent.

Nether Dream suddenly clenched her right fist and slammed it forward!

In an instant, the black circles of light spun around the branches in succession. Everywhere they passed, space was sliced apart into circles. It was extremely strange.

Rumble!

Rumbling resounded incessantly, and the explosions caused ripples to surge through space.

It didn’t take long for space to return to normal.

The roots were gone. But the circles of black light had vanished without a trace as well.

Yang Ye heaved a sigh of relief. Fortunately, the tree wasn’t invincible. Otherwise, they may have been in danger.

Meanwhile, Qiong Qi’s voice resounded in Yang Ye’s mind, “Kid, it’s best if you run right now! Otherwise, you won’t be able to leave even if you wanted to!”

Leave? Yang Ye shook his head. If he was being honest, he wanted to leave. However, could he leave right now?

Of course he couldn’t!

If he left now, even he would look down on himself!

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts and gazed at Nether Dream. His profound energy circulated within him. He never liked to entrust his hopes to someone else.

Meanwhile, Nether Dream’s expression had become solemn as well. Obviously, she sensed danger from the tree.

Suddenly, the tree shook violently. As it shook, the entire ground started to shake, and it felt like an earthquake.

It didn’t take long for the ancient tree to suddenly start shrinking before their eyes. It grew smaller and smaller. Around 15 minutes later, it had shrunk a few dozen times, and then a treant that was around 6m tall appeared before them.

Bang!

An extremely terrifying aura swept out from it. Yang Ye and the others were blasted backwards repeatedly.

Meanwhile, Hou Qing’s slightly anxious voice resounded in Yang Ye’s mind, “Kid, that fellow is at the Enlightened Realm at least! Run!”
