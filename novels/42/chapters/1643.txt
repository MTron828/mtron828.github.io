Chapter 1644 - What Do You Want?

Translator: InVader

Silent!

Deathly silent!

If Yang Ye had just been challenging and offending the Discipline Hall earlier, then now he’d slapped it on the face, and he’d slapped it hard!

“Interesting!” A smile curled up on the corners of Yang Jian’s mouth, “This cousin brother of mine isn’t ordinary! He isn’t ordinary at all!”

The black robed old man behind Yang Jian spoke indifferently, “Foolish!”

Yang Jian shook his head, “He isn’t foolish. If he can win in this battle, then those fellows in the Council of Elders will definitely pay attention to him and even foster him. Because while he isn’t suited to be the patriarch, he’s absolutely suitable to be a pioneer. If our Yang Clan wants to gain even more worlds, then it needs someone who dares to fight and charge forward in battle.”

He paused for a moment and continued, “Our clan never entrusts all its hopes onto a single person, and a single person can’t support the entire clan either. So, the clan normally has one person who’s in-charge of the clan’s internal affairs, the patriarch; and the other is in-charge of the external affairs!”

The black robed old man gazed at Yang Ye, “I understand. He’s suitable for leading the clan on the outside.”

Yang Jian nodded, and then he gazed at Yang Ye, “He may be a candidate to assist the next successor.”

The old man asked, “What about the eldest young miss?”

Yang Lianshuang!

Yang Jian’s eyes narrowed slightly. He fell silent for a long time before he said, “That eldest young miss of ours… will probably not be willing to just assist…”

The old man fell silent for a short while, and then he gazed at Yang Ye, “Should we help him?”

Yang Jian shook his head, “Let’s continue watching. Let’s see if he has the right to be the pioneer for our Yang Clan.”

Meanwhile, at the moment Qian Hu and Gu Xiu saw Yang Ye stomp apart the elder’s head, their expressions simultaneously became solemn.

At this moment, they felt a trace of fear.

As for Yang Xuan, her eyes drooped while she remained silent. No one knew what she was thinking.

“He’s got balls!” Yang Gu smiled, “Yang Ceng, that kid is really brave!”

The old man by his side, Yang Ceng, nodded, “He is. I just wonder if his strength can keep up with it!”

Yang Gu chuckled and gazed at Yang Ye, “Won’t we know soon?”

Meanwhile, at the moment Yang Ye stomped open the old man’s head, Yang Wuyan’s face had instantly turned gloomy, and a violent aura seeped out from him. Everywhere it passed, space rippled in its wake.

Yang Ye suddenly raised his leg and kicked the old man’s corpse, causing the latter to transform into a shadow that flew over to Yang Wuyan. After that, Yang Ye pointed his sword at Yang Wuyan and asked, “What do you want? I’ll keep you company to the end of it!”

Countless people gazed at Yang Wuyan!

What did he want?

He naturally wanted to kill Yang Ye!

If Yang Wuyan didn’t act against Yang Ye, it was obvious that from today onward, the Discipline Hall’s influence would be completely destroyed. It was obvious that more and more would try to resist the Discipline Hall, and it would be especially so for the unruly young masters of the clan!

So, such a precedent couldn’t be made!

Yang Ye had to be killed and made an example of!

Yang Wuyan took a step forward and looked at Yang Ye in the end, “You think that you’re very strong?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “I’ve never thought of myself like that, and I’ve never thought of overturning the Discipline Hall! But!” Yang Ye’s expression became ferocious, “Why didn’t you act when Yang Xu and Yang Yan tried to kill me, but you came to stop me when I was about to kill them? Why? Do I look like I’m easy to bully? Huh?”

As he spoke, he pointed his sword at Yang Xu, but he was looking at Yang Wuyan, “Since the Discipline Hall didn’t interfere from the very beginning, then don’t interfere now. Allow me and Yang Xu’s family to deal with the enmity between us.”

Yang Wuyan spoke coldly, “The honor of the Discipline Hall tolerates no offense!”

If he agreed to not interfere now, then it was obvious that he would be admitting defeat, and the power and influence that the Discipline Hall had accumulated over countless years would vanish in an instant!

Yang Ye nodded and said, “Then let’s fight! To the death!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he transformed into a blood red ray of light that vanished on the spot, and space rippled in its wake.

Yang Wuyan’s eyes narrowed slightly. A moment later, he pushed his right hand forward.

Bang!

The space before him surged up like a tsunami, and then it instantly enveloped the ray of light that Yang Ye had transformed into.

Boom!

An explosion resounded. The space in front of Yang Wuyan shook violently, and then a ray of blood red light was blasted backwards from there.

It was Yang Ye!

Yang Ye flew around 10k back before he finally dispersed the force from Yang Wuyan’s attack. As soon as he stopped, a wisp of blood seeped out from the corner of his mouth.

Suddenly, Yang Wuyan took a step forward, and then he gently waved his right palm down.

Hiss!

An energy palm suddenly tore its way out of the space before him, and then it shot off in Yang Ye’s direction. As it traveled, it tore space into bits, and the powerful energy it contained caused the space in a huge area to tremble incessantly.

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly. Even though it was impossible to determine the expression he had in his blood red eyes, everyone could still sense that he had a solemn expression on his face.

Lu Lige spoke solemnly, “Watch out! That old man may be a Half-Step True Realm expert!”

Yang Ye nodded slightly. He fell silent for a moment, and then he closed his eyes slowly. At the instant his eyes were shut completely, a strand of slaughter intent surged out from him, and then it was instantly poured into his sword.

When the energy palm arrived less than 10m away from him, Yang Ye suddenly opened his eyes, and then he vanished on the spot. A ray of blood red sword energy flashed forward from where he’d been standing.

The Sword of Rebirth!

The Sword of Rebirth could be said to be the strongest sword technique he had right now.

The sword energy and energy palm slammed against each other in midair.

Boom!

A moment of silence ensued before both shook violently. The energy palm cracked open, but the sword energy was obliterated. At the same time, a figure was blasted away while the energy palm slammed against his chest!

Bang!

The figure was instantly blasted far away!

It was Yang Ye’s figure.

As soon as he stopped himself, a strand of blood seeped out from the corner of his mouth. The blood flowed incessantly and instantly arrived before his chest. However, it only took an instant for the blood to be absorbed by the Heart of Slaughter within him.

“Hey! Why don’t we flee?” Lu Lige said, “That old man is definitely a Half-Step True Realm expert.”

Flee? Yang Ye shook his head. I can’t flee. Who will avenge Little Sky if I flee?

Moreover, he couldn’t escape. After all, this was the Yang Clan’s headquarters, so the Discipline Hall definitely had many experts here.

The Discipline Hall couldn’t use numbers against him right now because it wanted to save face. But once he fled, it would be able to openly gang up on him. Besides that, the Yang Clan was a clan that loved battle, so if he shrunk back right now, everyone in the Yang Clan would definitely look down on him!

In short, he couldn’t flee!

Moreover, he didn’t want to!

Meanwhile, Yang Wuyan suddenly took a step forward, “You’re not bad if compared with the other young masters, and you may have had a slight chance to become the successor if you didn’t offend my Discipline Hall. But now…” He slowly raised his right hand, “I’ll cripple you today so that the disciples of the Yang Clan understand a principle. Rules can’t be broken, and then Discipline Hall’s dignity tolerates no offense!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he twisted his right hand and slammed it forward in Yang Ye’s direction.

Boom!

The space before him rippled like waves, and it didn’t take long for those waves to overlap and slam down in Yang Ye’s direction.

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly. He fell silent for a moment before a wisp of resolve flashed through his eyes. A moment later, he took a step forward. In an instant, a mysterious wave of energy appeared here.

The Sword Domain!

As soon as the Sword Domain appeared, the waves in space seemed like they’d been slowed down and became very slow. Meanwhile, Yang Ye transformed into a ray of light that vanished on the spot. In an instant, countless rays of sword energy crisscrossed throughout the Sword Domain.

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!

Yang Ye’s sword energy instantly slices open the space that was suppressed by his Sword Domain. In just an instant, a huge black hole had been torn open within the scope of his Sword Domain. Once the black hole was formed, another mysterious wave of energy appeared within the Sword Domain!

The Laws of Darkness!

After he activated the Laws of Darkness, the black hole beneath his Sword Domain instantly started to shrink.

Yang Xu’s expression changed drastically at the sight of this, “Watch out!”

Meanwhile, the black hole suddenly exploded apart, and thunderous rumbling resounded incessantly.

At this moment, everyone was staring at that expanse of pitch black space without blinking. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Who won or lost?

Or perhaps, who’s alive and who’s dead?

Time trickled by. It didn’t take long for the black hole to gradually return to normal.

Yang Ye and Yang Wuyan appeared before their eyes again.

At this moment, Yang Ye’s right arm was gone. Moreover, his chest had caved in completely, and it looked extremely horrifying.

Yang Ye lost?

Such a thought appeared in the minds of countless. Because Yang Wuyan seemed to be completely fine. However, it only took a while for their expressions to change.

Because Yang Wuyan’s body was ethereal!

Only his soul remained!

In other words, his body had been destroyed!

Moreover, there was a red glow around Yang Wuyan’s body.

Slaughter intent!

Yang Ye had restrained Yang Wuyan’s soul!

Suddenly, Yang Ye looked towards the city, “Discipline Hall, what do you want?”

A moment of silence ensued, and then a voice came from within the city, “What do you want?”

“Me?” A ferocious smile curled up on the corners of Yang Ye’s mouth, and then he clenched his right fist in Yang Wuyan’s direction.

Boom!

The slaughter intent which surrounded Yang Wuyan exploded apart, and Yang Wuyan’s soul was obliterated with it!

Yang Ye looked straight into the city, “That’s what I want!”
