Chapter 268 – Return The Azure Sword?

After she received the two command tokens, Qin Xiyue gazed at Yang Ye and said, “You must come back alive. Otherwise, I’ll take the treasures you gave me and marry another man!”

Yang Ye was speechless. Such a threat is truly extraordinarily great.

Yang Ye shook his head, and then he flipped his palm. The two Earth Rank treasures he obtained from killing Qin Youran and Li Xianjun appeared in his palm. He said, “Take these two things as well. Don’t refuse because the finances needed to establish a power that can go against the Flower Palace is absolutely not something you can bear. I’ll craft some talismans for you during this month of time. I’m unable to help you in any other aspect. The only thing I can do is provide financial assistance to you!”

Qin Xiyue smiled sweetly as she received the Earth Rank treasures, and then she said, “Why would I refuse? I’m working for you right now, so you naturally have to resolve the issue of funding!”

Yang Ye smiled as well, and then he seemed to have thought of something and asked. “Is your mother alright?”

Qin Xiyue restrained her smile and nodded before she said, “Because of you, her position in the palace is merely inferior to the highest-ranking imperial concubines. Moreover, my status has improved greatly as well. Presently, the treatment I receive isn’t inferior to any prince or princess. In short, Little Brother, all of this is because of you. So, how do you think Big Sister should repay you? Should I devote my body to you?”

“Pledge your body to me? That’s something that can be considered....”

Qin Xiyue was stunned, and then she roared with laughter. As she roared with laughter, the ample peaks on her chest started shaking, and the sight of this caused Yang Ye to shudder slightly.

Yang Ye suppressed the feelings in his heart before he flipped his palm, and the two high-rank Technique Talismans that were part of the rewards from the Ascension Rankings had appeared in his palm. He passed them to her and said, “Don’t auction off this these high-rank Technique Talismans. Keep them to protect yourself.”

Qin Xiyue stopped laughing. She gazed at Yang Ye for a short while before she shook her head and sighed in the end. She said, “Little Brother, you have a resolute and decisive character, but you have a lethal flaw. You don’t hold back at all once you trust someone. After all, the thing that’s easiest to change in the world is the hearts of people. So, no matter who it is, even if it’s towards your loved ones, you should hold back a little, understand?”

Yang Ye smiled, and then he said, “Don’t worry, I know who to trust and who not to trust.” Indeed, the number of people Yang Ye trusted in this world could be counted with a single hand!

Qin Xiyue glanced at him and didn’t continue on this topic. She said, “I’ll gather information related to the Ancient Battlefield and Devil Race in the next few days, and I’ll contact you when I’m done. Besides that, don’t try to contact me yourself and don’t head to the Immortal Indulgence Pavilion. After all, countless powers have targeted you, and I don’t want the things I established with great pains to be exposed because of you!”

Yang Ye nodded to display his understanding.

Qin Xiyue left, and she left with some of the treasures he gathered in the Grand Myriad Mountains. In Yang Ye’s opinion, besides combat techniques and sword type treasures, all other treasures were of no use!

Yang Ye shook his head, withdrew the spatial ring Li Si gave him, and then glanced through the treasures within it. Yang Ye was instantly delighted when he saw the Earth Rank treasure within it because it was a sword! After the battle with Yuan Tong, Yang Ye noticed that a flaw of the sword chest, and it was that the swords within it were of too inferior quality.

If all the 36 swords within it were Earth Rank swords, then not to mention Yuan Tong, even 10 Yuan Tongs would be unable to resist its might once it was enhanced by Sword Intent.

However, it wasn’t that easy to transform those 36 swords into Earth Rank swords! Even though it was extremely difficult, it wasn’t a hopeless cause. Because with the mysterious tiny vortex and Yang Ye’s own wealth, gathering 36 Earth Rank swords was only a matter of time! Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

On the other hand, the Earth Rank technique was a palm technique called Stardrop Palm. Supposedly, its might could make the stars in the sky fall to the earth.... Yang Ye naturally didn’t believe it because not to mention an Earth Rank technique, even a Heaven Rank technique was unable to make a star fall from the sky!

However, Yang Ye was considerably satisfied with this technique because while its might was inferior to the Dragonbreaker, it had a benefit which was the difficulty to cultivate it wasn’t as terrifying as the Dragonbreaker! The Dragonbreaker had 3 levels. With the strength of Yang Ye’s physical body and coupled with Elder Mu’s guidance, he’d merely cultivated it to the 1st level.... Even Yang Ye couldn’t help but say that the difficulty of cultivating it was truly abnormal!

Besides the Dark Treasure and combat technique, there were 100 top-grade energy stones. If it were ordinary energy stones, then Yang Ye would naturally not attach any importance to them. However, they were top-grade energy stones, so even Yang Ye had no choice but to value them. After all, according to the market value of things, a single top-grade energy stone was equivalent to 1,000 energy stones. Moreover, it was a treasure that could rarely be purchased readily!

100 top-grade energy stones were equivalent to 100,000 energy stones. So, when these 100 top-grade energy stones were included in his existing wealth, then it could be said that even some Exalt Realm experts weren’t as wealthy as Yang Ye!

In short, Yang Ye was very satisfied with the rewards of the Ascension Rankings. Because these rewards could greatly improve his strength, and what he needed now was exactly to ceaselessly improve his strength!

Right at this moment, Yang Ye suddenly turned around and looked behind him. Su Qingshi had suddenly appeared there. When he thought about how this woman before him hadn’t hesitated to make a move against the Palace Master of the Flower Palace earlier, Yang Ye’s heart felt warm, and he said, “I thought you’d returned to the Sword Sect!”

Su Qingshi shook her head slightly. She pondered deeply for a short while before she said, “I’m very sorry for what the Sword Sect did to you!”

“That has nothing to do with you!” Yang Ye smiled as he said, “You are you, and the Sword Sect is the Sword Sect. Even though the Sword Sect betrayed me, you’ve never done so. My feelings towards you have never changed. I don’t have the strength to change a lot of things now, but I guarantee that such a day will come. At that time, I’ll head to the Sword Sect to look for you. I guarantee that it won’t be too long from now!”

Su Qingshi stared at Yang Ye for a short while before she said, “I’ll be waiting for you in the Sword Sect!” As soon as she finished speaking, Su Qingshi’s figure flashed and transformed into a ray of green light that vanished on the horizon.

Su Qingshi had just left when Daoist Zui suddenly appeared where Su Qingshi stood just moments ago. A wisp of regret flashed in Daoist Zui’s eyes as he gazed at Yang Ye, and then he said, “Kid, I’ll be frank because it’s pointless to say anything now. I came looking for you because I hope you’ll return the Azure Sword to the Sword Sect!”

Yang Ye laughed with self-ridicule and said, “Senior, do I even have the qualifications to refuse in front of you?” As soon as he finished speaking, the Azure Sword appeared in his hand.

Right at this moment, it suddenly shook before it transformed into its Sword Spirit. The little girl glanced at Daoist Zui before she said, “Geezer, I want to go with him.” Her tone was indisputable!

Daoist Zui shook his head and said, “Going with him will only harm him. A First Heaven Realm profounder possessing a Dao Artifact. At that time, it would just be the Flower palace and Origin School that go after him. He’s utterly unable to take control of you with his current strength. Moreover, every single time he forcefully utilizes you will harm his meridians, and he’ll be crippled after a few more times!”

“Geezer, those are all excuses!” The little girl stared at Daoist Zui with a hostile gaze and said, “Don’t think that you can deceive me just because I’m a Sword Spirit. At the bottom of it all, you just don’t want a Dao Artifact of the Sword Sect to fall into the hands of an outsider, right?”

Daoist Zui shook his head and didn’t speak further. With a wave of his right hand, the Azure Sword instantly transformed into its form as a sword before he forcefully put it away in his spatial ring. After that, he glanced at Yang Ye, and he seemed to want to say something yet didn’t speak in the end. He just flashed and vanished on the spot.

Yang Ye took a deep breath when he saw Daoist Zui leave, and a cold glow flashed in his eyes. Even though Yang Ye had come to participate in the Ascension Rankings for Su Qingshi and his mother’s sakes, it was the Sword Sect that obtained all the benefits. However, once the Sword Sect obtained the benefits, it didn’t just refuse to protect him from the Flower Palace, it even took the Azure Sword back....

It was naturally impossible for Yang Ye to not feel infuriated. However, he knew that anger was pointless! What could he do if he was furious and displeased? His strength was too weak in the end!

The Sword Sect, the Flower Palace, the Ghost Sect, the Origin School.... Yang Ye laughed coldly. He intended to repay all of them for everything they’d done to him. As it was said, what goes around comes around!

After he left the square outside the Imperial Palace, Yang Ye headed to the Talisman Master’s Association. He’d never had any resentment towards the Talisman Master’s Association and his master, Lin Shan. Because since the very beginning, if it wasn’t for his master, Lin Shan, then he, Yang Ye, would have probably died at the hands of the Flower Palace a very long time ago. Especially Little Yao. If he didn’t have Lin Shan, then Little Yao would probably be unable to grow up in a good environment like she was right now!

Even though the Talisman Master’s Association had abandoned him because of the pressure it suffered from the Darkbeast Empire, it had never betrayed him. Conversely, he’d obtained plenty of benefits from it but had never done anything for the association or his master. Yang Ye wasn’t a selfish person, so he still took Lin Shan as his master!

In the room, Lin Shan gazed at Yang Ye as he said, “Do you resent me?”

Yang Ye shook his head. He stretched out his hand to rub Little Yao’s head as he said, “I did, a little, at the very beginning. However, I don’t anymore. Since the beginning, Master and the Talisman Master’s Association have done a great deal for me.”

Lin Shan gazed at Yang Ye for a short while, and when he noticed that Yang Ye didn’t seem to be faking it, he sighed lightly and said, “The Talisman Master’s Association is a collective. Everyone is extremely united at most times. However, this is only limited to instances when outsiders intend to bring harm to the interests of the entire association. All of us really look favorably upon your natural talent. However, you, your Martial Uncle Bai Shan, and I aren’t able to represent the entire association. If the interests of those old fellows are harmed, then the entire association would probably fall into internal strife. This is exactly the reason why your Martial Uncle and I didn’t stop you from leaving the association!”

Yang Ye smiled and said, “I understand. I came to the association this time because there’s something I want to ask of Master!”

Lin Shan glanced at Little Yao and said, “Is it Yao’er?”

Yang Ye nodded.

“Don’t worry, no one can harm her with me by her side!” Lin Shan guaranteed.

Yang Ye bowed to Lin Shan when he heard this because this was exactly what he wanted to hear.
