Chapter 2681 – Change

Yang Ye stood there while seeming to be in a daze.

One of his arms was gone!

At that instant, he hadn’t been able to dodge even one of the three swords!

It wasn’t that they were too fast, it was like they’d discerned what his next moves would be. So, when he raised his sword to defend himself, their attacks had perfectly avoided his defenses.Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Every one of those attacks were just so perfect!

They were without any flaws!

That was what he felt about them!

Most importantly, those attacks had no profound energy in them, nor even sword energy or sword intent.

They were just three ordinary attacks with the sword!

Of course, Yang Ye was very well aware that since they could swing such ordinary attacks, their sword technique was absolutely not ordinary.

The sword!

Yang Ye gazed at Past Life with a blank expression in his eyes!

Was all my training in the sword in vain?

At this moment, Yang Ye felt quite lost!

These three wooden figures had struck a tremendous blow to his confidence.

But it didn’t take long for the bewilderment in his eyes to become ferocity!

A test?

No!

He must realize that while the woman in white was testing him, it was a test that could end in death! If he didn’t choose to give up, it was obvious that he may die!

The wooden figure’s words were the best hint to that!

The woman in white had let him off easy for the first time, but it was definitely the last.

If he challenged the three wooden figures now, his failure would end in death!

It was an undoubtable fact!

Yang Ye just sat there and gazed at the wooden figures.

They didn’t attack him. Obviously, he had to go over before they would attack.

And he had to defeat them in order to obtain the box behind them.

The box that the woman in white had left him!

Yang Ye remained silent for a long time. In the end, he laid there on the ground while the injury on his chest still remained. The only difference was that the bleeding had stopped.

He wasn’t able to use Primordial Violet Energy anymore!

Now, every injury had to be healed naturally… And it wouldn’t be exaggerated to say that he was covered in injuries by now.

It seemed like an impossible test!

In the Primordial Pagoda.

Snowy and Erya were at the Ascension Platform with worry all over their faces.

It was because Yang Ye had even lost an arm!

Both of them were very sad and worried!

However, because Yang Ye had given them strict instructions to not help him, they could only watch.

They were very afraid of him when he was serious!

Outside the Primordial Pagoda.

A day passed before Yang Ye stood up, and he walked toward the wooden figures with Past Life in his hand.

Nervous!

It was his most nervous moment in history because he had no confidence at all.

But he had no choice either.

He didn’t want to give up!

The woman in white had given him an opportunity, and he didn’t want to just give it up.

A short while later, Yang Ye arrived before the wooden figures. He glanced at them and asked, “Can we fight one by one?”

The wooden figure in the lead shook its head slightly.

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

Meanwhile, the leader of the wooden figures suddenly strode forward and stabbed at Yang Ye’s chest!

At the same time, the other two wooden figures behind it attacked as well.

A three-way attack!

Yang Ye closed his eyes slowly.

He didn’t look with his eyes, he could only sense them with his heart instead!

He sensed them stabbing at him from three different directions. One toward his chest, one toward his right arm, and the last toward the left of his waist.

The three swords were very fast, accurate, and ruthless!

Besides that, there was nothing else special about them!

Yang Ye took a step back, but it wasn’t able to create any distance between him and the swords. Conversely, they grew even closer!

Yang Ye drew his sword!

Past Life slashed forward!

A brute-force attack!

Because he didn’t have a better choice besides that.

Yang Ye’s sword slashed down!

Hiss! Hiss!

Yang Ye retreated a little over a meter, and blood sprayed from his waist. Moreover, there was an injury running down his forehead until his chin. It was quite deep, and it had destroyed his face!

But Yang Ye’s right arm was intact!

At the critical moment, he’d ignored the attack to his waist and retreated while barely avoiding the sword to his forehead. At the same time, he blocked the sword to his arm with all his strength!

He’d succeeded!

However, the price of success was still quite huge!

Yang Ye moved aside, and they didn’t follow up with another attack. They returned to their spots.

It wasn’t that they didn’t want to attack, Yang Ye had fled quickly and left the hall.

Obviously, they couldn’t leave the hall!

Yang Ye just laid there on the stone stairs outside the hall. His face was bleeding, and so was his waist.

It was more than terrible!

Meanwhile, a Divine Crystal appeared before Yang Ye.

Yang Ye was stunned by it, and then he shook his head and smiled. Obviously, it was Snowy’s doing.

He felt really warm inside!

Yang Ye was about to shake his head when Snowy and Erya appeared before him. Snowy gazed at Yang Ye and waved her paws swiftly.

She was waving them very, very quickly, and in a very agitated manner.

Even Erya didn’t know what Snowy was saying this time.

But Yang Ye did.

He shook his head.

Snowy immediately started crying.

Erya blinked and asked, “Big Brother Yang, do you know what Snowy said?”

Yang Ye rolled his eyes at Erya. He naturally understood. After all, he was a master at talking to animals!

Erya gave Yang Ye a big thumbs up and said, “Big Brother Yang, as your sister, forgive me for saying too much. Even though that woman left you here as a test and even sealed your cultivation, did she say you can’t use your profound energy to heal?”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

Erya continued, “Besides that, haven’t you noticed? Your sword and thoughts are changing. In other words, you’re learning to be flexible. Your sword and thoughts aren’t as fixed as they used to be. So, be flexible!

Her voice grew slightly louder at this point, “Since she didn’t forbid you from using profound energy to heal, why don’t you?”

As she spoke, she kicked Past Life, “The sword isn’t living, but you are alive. Understand?”

Yang Ye frowned and no one knew what he was thinking.

Meanwhile, Past Life was clearly quite displeased. Why kick it? It wasn’t its fault!

So, it let out a sword howl to display its objection!

Erya, who clearly had quite a bad temper, suddenly howled at Past Life, “Just shut up! Make another noise and I’ll break you!”

Past Life was stunned.
