Chapter 1327 – SuChapter Envy!

Needless to say, Nie Hun’s face was extremely unsightly right now.

He was about to flee earlier. But when he saw Mo Xiaoleng attack Yang Ye, he’d chosen to stay behind because he wanted to seize the opportunity to kill Yang Ye. He felt that if he attacked when Yang Ye and the young woman were both heavily injured from their battle, then he would have a very good chance to kill Yang Ye. But he hadn’t expected her to be actually helpless against him!

Moreover, he hadn’t expected Yang Ye to actually divert her attention to him!

When the young woman gazed at him, Nie Hun didn’t hesitate to turn around and flee. After all, just the young woman was so terrifying, now that Yang Ye had joined forces with her, how could he possibly be a match for them?

At the exact same moment that Nie Hun fled, the wings on Yang Ye’s back flapped swiftly, and then Yang Ye transformed into a ray of light that appeared in front of Nie Hun. Yang Ye didn’t waste his breath at all, and he just drew his sword and swung it.

Nie Hun’s expression changed at the sight of this. He didn’t choose to go head-on against Yang Ye’s attack because he was very well aware that once he got locked in combat with Yang Ye, he would never be able to leave. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Nie Hun’s figure flashed with the intention of avoiding Yang Ye’s attack. Suddenly, a ray of violet light appeared behind Nie Hun. It had appeared so suddenly and without even making a ripple through space, so Nie Hun had only noticed it when it arrived behind him.

Nie Hun paid no attention to the violet light and just allowed it to strike him. His figure trembled, but a slight smile curled up on the corners of his mouth. Because he’d moved around 300m to the right. But right when he was about to flee, the space around him suddenly froze before being compressed in layers!

“Fuck off!” Nie Hun howled with fury as he slapped his palm forward. A ray of white light flashed and the space around him instantly collapsed. Meanwhile, Yang Ye appeared before him again, and a sword that was swift like a bolt of lightning instantly arrived before his forehead.

Nie Hun was horrified and immediately slapped his right palm at Yang Ye’s sword.

Bang!

Yang Ye was pushed around 300m back again, and Nie Hun’s figure moved backwards repeatedly as well.

Suddenly, Nie Hun’s eyes opened wide because a golden flame had arrived before him, and the heat it emanated caused his body to start melting. Nie Hun was horrified, and his figure flashed with the intention of dodging it. However, a violet barrier of light suddenly appeared around him and trapped him there.

“Fuck off!” Nie Hun howled furiously as he slapped his palm forward and instantly shattered the violet barrier of light. However, his pupils suddenly constricted to the size of needles because the golden flame had struck him.

Bang!

Nie Hun’s figure instantly started burning. He howled hysterically with rage while enveloped by the flames, and numerous circles of white light surged out from within him. However, it was utterly useless. The white circles of light were instantly incinerated upon leaving his body, and it didn’t take long for Nie Hun’s entire body to be incinerated. Only the burning golden flames still remained where he stood.

Yang Ye had an extremely solemn expression on his face as he gazed at the golden flames, and there even was a trace of fear in his eyes. Even though his body was at the Epoch Realm, he firmly believed that he would be completely incinerated if he allowed the golden flames to envelop him. The golden flames were definitely the 2nd most terrifying type of flame he’d seen in his lifetime.

The 1st was naturally the Divine Yin Flame that resided within the pill furnace in the Primordial Pagoda.

Mo Xiaoleng waved her right hand, and then golden flame instantly vanished on the spot. After that, she gazed at Yang Ye. Yang Ye’s eyelids twitched, and he hurriedly brought Snowy out from within the pocket of space.

Mo Xiaoleng’s eyelids twitched when she saw Yang Ye bring Snowy out, and she said, “Human, do you know how to use them?”

She was extremely annoyed with Yang Ye. Her Laws of Time were useless against Yang Ye, and the golden flame was the worst. She didn’t even dare to take it out. As for her spatial techniques, Yang Ye had a Spatial Mink by his side, so those spatial techniques of hers were completely crippled. In short, she couldn’t use anything against Yang Ye.

“Use them?” Yang Ye shook his head, “You used the wrong term. It’s absolutely wrong. We’re just sharing both success and difficulty.” He looked down and rubbed Snowy’s head gently when he spoke up to this point, “Right, Snowy?”

Snowy quickly nodded. Even if she didn’t really understand what Yang Ye was saying.

“How shameless!” Mo Xiaoleng spoke coldly, “She hasn’t reached adulthood yet, so her mind is like that of a child. She doesn’t know how to differentiate between good or bad. You should really suffer the wrath of the heavens for using her like this!”

“Say what you want!” Yang Ye continued, “In any case, she’s with me.” Yang Ye was naturally attached to Snowy. It could be said that he had no intention to use Snowy. Even if Snowy wasn’t a Sprite Lord or possessed any special abilities, he would still treat Snowy as a loved one. Similarly, he believed that even if he was ordinary, Snowy would still be so close to him. Their relationship hadn’t been built to seek benefits for themselves in any way.

As for making Snowy help him, he felt that it was absolutely normal. Because wasn’t it normal for them to help each other? Moreover, he was able to sense that Snowy was very happy to be able to help him. Of course, he was even happier.

Mo Xiaoleng glanced at Yang Ye, and then she glanced at Snowy. Needless to say, she was really filled with envy. Because a human had never been able to form such a good relationship with a Sprite Lord. The status of a Sprite Lord in a large word was supreme. Even her clan couldn’t compare to it. If one was able to form a good relationship with a Sprite Lord, then the benefits of that was simply unimaginable! That was why she’d ceaselessly given precious fruits to Snowy. Because she wanted to form a good relationship with Snowy.

Yet now, the Sprite Lord before her didn’t just have a good relationship with Yang Ye, the Sprite Lord practically obeyed everything Yang Ye said.

She was envious!

Mo Xiaoleng was filled with envy.

Bang!

Suddenly, a loud explosion resounded from behind him. Yang Ye turned and looked, and then his eyes instantly narrowed slightly. He saw Heaven Pillar Peak collapsing. The demon race’s army had retreated backwards, and Yang Ye moved 30km back as well. After that, all of them watched as the mountain collapsed incessantly. Countless huge rocks flew out in all directions while dust and dirt shot up into the air. It was an absolutely shocking sight.

“Your human race is finished!” Meanwhile, Mo Xiaoleng suddenly spoke, “The demon race’s army will annihilate all humans.”

Yang Ye fell silent. He was very well aware that unless the humans in the Veiled Region went to Dark Hell Continent, they would definitely die now that Heaven Pillar Peak had been destroyed. Moreover, based on how the demon race was acting, it might not even spare Dark Hell Continent. If that really happened, then it meant that the Sword Alliance would have to face the demon race. Even if the experts of the 3 sects and 3 cities were included, the Sword Alliance’s current strength was still insufficient to fight the demon race!

Yang Ye remained silent for a short while before he looked towards the demon race’s territory, “Those fellows from the Nie Clan went to seize that treasure from the demon race?”

He’d watched as 12 Voiders from the Nie Clan shot towards the demon race’s territory. Actually, he’d been shocked by that scene as well. After all, if those 12 Voiders were combined with the Voiders he’d already killed, the Nie Clan had around 25 Voiders!

25!

Actually, besides shock, he felt a trace of fear. Because if the Nie Clan hadn’t been planning to seize that treasure from the demon race, it would have definitely sent those Voiders at him. Just thinking about being besieged by 25 Voiders caused Yang Ye to be unable to avoid shuddering. Moreover, there was a Voider amongst that group of 12 that possessed an extremely terrifying aura, and that aura was a few times stronger than Nie Hun!

Obviously, it was that ancestor of the Nie Clan!

Meanwhile, Mo Xiaoleng started chuckling, and Yang Ye instantly felt like he was having a headache when he heard it. Regardless of whether it was her smile or the way she spoke, they were all filled with ridicule. It was like everyone else was trash in her eyes, and it was a truly terrible feeling.

He really wanted to beat her up! But he really wasn’t confident in being able to defeat her!

Mo Xiaoleng laughed coldly for a while before she said, “That old bastard actually thought about stealing a treasure from the demon race. He’s truly tired of living.”

Yang Ye asked, “The demon race is prepared for him?”

Mo Xiaoleng glanced at Yang Ye and remained silent. She waved her right hand and the Cloud Eagle in the distance immediately flew over and stopped beneath her. Mo Xiaoleng stood on the eagle as she gazed at Yang Ye and said, “I’m going to kill those old bastards of the Nie Clan. Want to come with me?”

Yang Ye remained silent.

Hmph!

Mo Xiaoleng grunted coldly, and then she tapped her foot lightly against the eagle’s back. The eagle immediately transformed into a ray of light that shot towards the demon race’s territory.

Meanwhile, the army of demon beasts had passed over the collapsed ruins of Heaven Pillar Peak and were marching towards the central area of the human race’s territory. However, Yang Ye couldn’t do anything about that. He wasn’t a savior, nor did he have the ability to be one. His strength was utterly insufficient to stop the army of demon beasts. Moreover, if he tried, then it was obvious that the young woman from before would come looking for him. Besides that the other Voiders of the demon race and that Demon Empress whose strength he couldn’t fathom would definitely come for him as well.

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment, and then his figure shot after Mo Xiaoleng. However, he didn’t travel there openly, and he merged into space and concealed himself instead. Regardless of whether it was the demon race or those old geezers of the Nie Clan, they weren’t easy to deal with. So, it was best to be cautious.

It didn’t take long for Yang Ye to arrive deep within the demon race’s territory while following behind Mo Xiaoleng. Suddenly, roaring laughter resounded from deep within the mountainous area, “HAHAHA! I’ve finally got it! Hahaha! It’s finally mine!”

Mo Xiaoleng’s face instantly became unsightly when she heard the voice.
