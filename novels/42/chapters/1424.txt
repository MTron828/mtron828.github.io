Chapter 1425 – You Surrender? I Refuse To Accept It!

The Celestial Demon Wolf didn’t resist in the end. It was because of Qiong Qi, of course. It wasn’t that Qiong Qi had scared it into submission, but it felt that since a ferocious beast like Qiong Qi had been willing to let Yang Ye ride him, then it didn’t matter even if Yang Ye rode it!

Now that it had such an excuse, the Demon Wolf instantly felt much better.

Actually, Yang Ye hadn’t summoned the Demon Wolf to be his mount because he wanted to put on airs. He wasn’t that bored. It was because travelling through space exhausted a huge amount of profound energy. Especially when he was just a Voider. The volume of profound energy he possessed was far lower than Elder Yuan and the others. So, he summoned the Demon Wolf to take him to his destination instead. In this way, he wouldn’t have to exhaust his own strength.

Moreover, the Celestial Demon Wolf’s speed wasn’t inferior to him at all!

Yang Ye’s group shot swiftly through space. Their destination was Nether Blue Stellar Region.

Zhuang Weiran suddenly asked, “Don’t you have another demon wolf?”

Yang Ye asked, “Why?”

She replied, “You can let me ride that one!” Elder Yuan and the others were frequently glancing at her and Yang Ye with grins on their faces. Even though she didn’t feel aversion towards it, it made her feel quite uncomfortable.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye wrapped his arms around Zhuang Weiran’s waist as he moved his head close to her ear, and he whispered, “I just like hugging you like this!”

Zhuang Weiran’s delicate figure stiffened slightly, but it didn’t take long for her to return to normal.

She remained silent for a while before she nodded slightly, “Alright!” VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

A smile instantly curled up on the corners of Yang Ye’s mouth. He didn’t try to go too far, and he just hugged her. After all, Elder Yuan and the others were here, and Zhuang Weiran wasn’t someone who was willing to show weakness before others. So, he would naturally not do anything that would embarrass her. He just hugged her because it would definitely not cause any problems.

All of them sped up under Yang Ye’s orders.

Their destination was Nether Blue Stellar Region. As for the reason for this choice, it was because Nether Blue Stellar Region was the closest.

Two hours later, Yang Ye’s group finally entered the main world of Nether Blue Stellar Region, Nether Blue Continent.

Zhuang Weiran asked, “Are we going to launch a surprise attack?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “Surprise attacks are used when our strength is inferior or when their strength is equal to ours. But our strength far surpasses them, so we’re attacking directly!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye’s figure suddenly soared up into the air, and then he transformed into a ray of light that shot towards Nether Blue Continent.

Zhuang Weiran and the others followed closely behind him.

Bang!

A few breaths of time later, a loud explosion resounded in the sky above Nether Blue Continent, and then the restrictions that surrounded it shattered.

“Who did that?!” A furious howl resounded from Nether Blue City, and then five pillars of light shot up from the city. However, a colossus greeted their arrival.

It was the Celestial Demon Wolf, of course!

The demon wolf dived down from the sky, and it slammed against the pillars of light. The pillars of light instantly shattered beneath the demon wolf’s formidable aura, and then five old men appeared below the demon wolf. All of their expressions changed drastically when they saw the demon wolf, and they attacked simultaneously!

Rumble!

The demon wolf was blasted backwards by their joint forces, but it wasn’t injured at all. After that, it dived down again. This time, a ray of light shot down along with it.

“It’s Yang Ye!” The Deities had extremely unsightly expressions on their faces when they saw the ray of light. Actually, they’d guessed that Yang Ye was here when they saw the Celestial Demon Wolf. However, they still held a trace of hope in their hearts. But that hope had vanished when they saw the ray of light which clearly came from a sword.

The ray of light and the demon wolf shot down menacingly, so all five of them didn’t dare act carelessly and attacked once more.

Rumble!

Deafening rumbling resounded in the sky, and the space throughout the sky rippled violently. It seemed like the space there was about to shatter. However, the space there was clearly extremely strong, so it merely cracked apart and didn’t collapse.

Yang Ye and the demon wolf were blasted back by the joint forces of those five Deities. However, they were blasted away as well. Moreover, one of the old men was even struck by a strand of sword energy. While he hadn’t died from it, he was injured.

Meanwhile, Zhuang Weiran and Elder Yuan’s group had arrived.

A black robed old man from Nether Blue Stellar Region stepped forward and looked straight at Yang Ye, “Yang Ye, there’s no enmity between my Nether Blue Stellar Region and your Clouds of Heaven Stellar Region. So, why have you attacked us today?”

“There’s no enmity between us?” A wisp of ridicule curled up on the corners of Yang Ye’s mouth, “If I’m not wrong, you’ve already called for help, right? You’re just wasting your breath like this to buy time. My response to that is... dream on!”

As soon as Yang Ye finished speaking, Yang Ye waved his right hand and said, “Don’t spare a single Deity or Semi-Deity! Kill them all!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye and the demon wolf shot at the black robed old man’s group, and they were so swift that they instantly arrived before the black robed old man’s group. Yang Ye didn’t waste his breath and just drew his sword and swung it at an old man before him.

Heavenrend!

The old man’s expression changed drastically at the sight of Yang Ye’s attack. He’d naturally heard of that sword technique. After all, Yang Ye had used it to obliterate Celestial Demon City.

The other old men knew how terrifying Yang Ye’s sword technique was as well. So, they didn’t dare to let the old man resist it on his own. They immediately shot over to the old man’s side, and then they slapped their palms forward in unison. As Deities, they possessed the Laws of Time, but the Laws of Time couldn’t be utilized in front of Yang Ye.

Firstly, Yang Ye’s sword technique’s strength had surpassed the limits of the Laws of Time. Secondly, Yang Ye possessed the Sword Domain that could suppress all Laws. So, that lethal move that belonged solely to Deities, the Laws of Time, were useless before Yang Ye, and it was the main reason why Yang Ye could surmount his realm of cultivation and challenge Deities.

Because the strongest ability Deities had was useless against him!

Bang!

Even though Yang Ye’s attack was formidable, the five of them had been able to resist it and even push Yang Ye back. However, the demon wolf had slammed against one of the old men. Even though that old man had fought back at the critical moment, how could he resist the Celestial Demon Wolf?

Boom!

The old man was blasted away, and he flew extremely far away. Once his figure stopped flying, he almost crashed straight to the ground.

The collision hadn’t just cracked apart his body, even his internal organs had cracked open.

He was heavily injured!

That Deity had been heavily injured by the collision with the demon wolf. While he hadn’t lost his ability to fight, his combat strength was probably less than half of what it had been!

Meanwhile, Zhuang Weiran and the others had charged over to the other four old men.

Moreover, Yang Ye had summoned the other demon wolf.

They were suppressed. Not only in strength, but even in numbers! Because Yang Ye’s side possessed an absolute advantage in numbers!

Around 15 minutes later, one of the old men was caught by a demon wolf, and then he was devoured alive. Once they lost a Deity, the situation that the forces of Nether Blue Stellar Region were in couldn’t even be described as terrible.

“Yang Ye!” Suddenly, one of the old men said, “Yang Ye, my Nether Blue Stellar Region accepts defeat. We’re willing to return the world that belonged to Clouds of Heaven Stellar Region!”

Elder Yuan and the others immediately stopped and gazed at Yang Ye.

A cold smile curled up on the corners of Yang Ye’s mouth, “You accept defeat? What a good plan. You accept it now so that you can avoid calamity, and then wait for your reinforcements from Wildlands Stellar Region and the other stellar regions. Would you still accept defeat once they arrive? No, you won’t! At that time, we would be the ones who were in trouble!”

He was very well aware that they weren’t really accepting their defeat. Because they hadn’t really been hit to the point it hurt. Just as Yang Ye said, they were actually just buying time and waiting for reinforcements to arrive. It was their strategy to buy time until reinforcements arrived.

If Yang Ye really believed them, then he would definitely be the fool in the end.

Once they heard Yang Ye, Elder Yuan, Zhuang Weiran, and the others immediately charged at the Deities from Nether Blue Stellar Region.

The black robed old man’s face instantly became extremely unsightly. Actually, it was just as Yang Ye had said, they were buying time. Because they’d sought help from Wildlands Stellar Region and the other stellar regions. Those stellar regions had agreed to help, so they just had to buy time and the danger they faced would be resolved!

But Yang Ye didn’t give them the chance!

The black robed old man remained silent for a moment, and then he howled with fury, “Flee!”

As soon as he finished speaking, his figure shot towards the sky.

Fight?

They didn’t stand a chance against Yang Ye’s group! Wait? Their reinforcements would definitely not be in time. Because Yang Ye’s side possessed an absolute advantage over them!

The only way to live was to flee!

However, he’d just started to flee when shrill cries resounded from behind him.

The black robed old man’s face became extremely unsightly, but he didn’t turn back and sped up instead.

Flee!

Flee as quickly as possible!

That was the only thought in the black robed old man’s mind.

But it didn’t take long for him to stop because Yang Ye had appeared before him while riding a Celestial Demon Wolf.

The old man’s speed was very swift, but it couldn’t compete with the demon wolf!

The old man gazed at Yang Ye for a long time and said, “I surrender!”

“I refuse!” As soon as Yang Ye finished speaking, the demon wolf beneath him transformed into a ray of dark light that shot at the old man.

The old man’s furious howl resounded through the sky, “Yang Ye! I’ll take you down with me!”

After that, numerous explosions resounded through the sky.

Around a dozen breaths of time later, that area in the sky finally calmed down, and only Yang Ye and the demon wolf remained there.

The black robed old man’s strength wasn’t bad, but both Yang Ye and the demon wolf were stronger than him. Not to mention that the two of them had joined forces against the old man!

Yang Ye didn’t waste any time, and he just rode the demon wolf to Zhuang Weiran and the others’ side. After that, he looked down at Nether Blue City. He gazed at it for a long time before a thought suddenly appeared in Yang Ye’s mind.

Would my slaughter intent rise to the Returnal Rank if I slaughter the entire city?
