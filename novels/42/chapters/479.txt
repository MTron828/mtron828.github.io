Chapter 480 – Revealing His Trump Card!

A large axe tore through the air, and it formed a ray of light as it slashed down forcefully at Yang Ye. Everywhere it passed, space was torn apart when numerous long and pitch black rifts appeared in the air.

Yang Ye’s pupils constricted. That old geezer’s strength is actually so formidable! An expert of such level wasn’t someone he could go against right now unless he utilized that secret technique to rise into the Exalt Realm! However, he would naturally not utilize it because it exhausted his vitality and potential.

The large axe was too swift and had locked onto Yang Ye’s aura, so he couldn’t evade it at all. A wisp of a fierce expression flashed through his eyes as Dragonbone appeared in his grasp, and then the profound energy within his body instantly surged into Dragonbone before he shouted and performed a downward slash!

Clang!

An enormous explosion resounded through the surroundings. As soon as Dragonbone had just come into contact with the large axe, an enormous force came from Dragonbone and caused his entire left arm to tremble violently. After that, both Yang Ye and Ding Shaoyao who he still held in his arm was blasted flying by the enormous force, and they flew for over 1km before they were finally able to stop!

Cough!

Yang Ye wiped off the bloodstain on the corner of his mouth, and then he raised his head to gaze at the old man with a solemn expression. Even though he’d killed fifth rank Exalt Realm experts and even ninth rank Exalt Realm experts, that was under the circumstances that he’d relied on that secret technique to rise into the Exalt Realm. After all, the might of his Sword Intent, Void Flash, and Sword Domain were multiplied numerous times when he attained the Exalt Realm. Moreover, he even grasped a little spatial energy. That was exactly why he was able to kill Exalt Realm experts at the fifth rank of the Exalt Realm and above!

In the past, he thought that even if he still wasn’t at the Exalt Realm, he should still be able to go against fifth rank Exalt Realm experts. But he noticed now that he was wrong. He was utterly unable to go against experts at the fifth rank of the Exalt Realm and above with his current strength.

I have to work hard on improving my cultivation! Yang Ye spoke softly in his heart. Just as Elder Mu had said, his cultivation was his foundation. If his cultivation didn’t improve, then he would be unable to fully bring forth the might of his Sword Intent, Sword Domain, and the Dao Artifacts he possessed. So, improving his cultivation was a pressing task at hand!

A wisp of astonishment flashed through Ding Xiang’s eyes when he saw Yang Ye resist his attack. Even though he hadn’t utilized his full strength just now, he’d used 70% of it. But an ant at the second rank of the Spirit Realm had stopped an attack of his that carried 70% of his strength?

But in next to no time, Ding Xiang’s eyes were covered in a ferocious expression. No matter what his background is, he’s going to die today!

After all, that was his one and only son! However, just a moment of carelessness had cost him his son, and it had even occurred right before his eyes. Ding Xiang simply desired to destroy the world when he thought of this!

“Bastard! And you, Bitch! I’m going to make living worse than death for the both of you!” Ding Xiang shouted furiously as his figure flashed and instantly arrived before Yang Ye. The large axe in his hand left a long trail of light behind it and carried terrifying force and pressure as it chopped down forcefully towards Yang Ye and Ding Shaoyao. As it descended, countless axe images instantly flashed into appearance and enveloped an area of 600m around Yang Ye and Ding Shaoyao.

The terrifying pressure emanated by the large axe caused the ground beneath their feet to collapse and reveal an enormous pit that was over 300m in diameter.

This time, Ding Xiang hadn’t held back, and he’d used his full strength!

The corners of Yang Ye’s mouth twitched when he sensed the terrifying strength contained within the large axe. This damnable geezer is going all out! Yang Ye didn’t choose to block it with Dragonbone because he was very well aware that even if his physical body was comparable to an Exalt Realm expert, his arm would definitely be blasted apart if he blocked it with Dragonbone.

Yang Ye couldn’t help but feel slightly speechless when he thought about how he’d just been discussion how to kill Ding Xiang with Ding Shaoyao.... At this moment, they should be thinking about how to escape him instead of killing him!

Yang Ye took a deep breath and spoke in his heart. Sword Domain!

As soon as those words resounded in his heart, time seemed as if it had been stopped. The axe images in an area of 30m around Yang Ye had been instantly frozen on the spot, whereas, Ding Xiang’s axe wasn’t able to descend anymore upon arriving around 50cm above Yang Ye’s head. Yang Ye’s countenance suddenly turned pale, and he stopped for an instant before he shouted. “Shattered!”

As soon as he spoke, the countless axe images instantly dispersed into the air.

Ding Xiang’s expression changed violently, and he held his axe in his grasp as he flashed backward by over 300m. He gazed at Yang Ye as he spoke with astonishment. “Sword Domain! It was the Sword Domain! Who... who exactly are you...?”

Bang!

The Ninth Hell Swordwings appeared behind Yang Ye, and then they flapped before Yang Ye vanished beneath the night sky. Only an idiot would answer that old geezer right now. In Yang Ye’s opinion, fleeing was the most important matter at hand. He didn’t waste his strength to attack Ding Xiang with Void Flash because he couldn’t kill Ding Xiang even if he used Void Flash. Unless he took Ding Xiang by surprise, otherwise, it would only be a waste of profound energy!

“The Sword Domain.... The Sword Domain. How could that be possible? He’s only around the age of 20, so how could he have comprehended Sword Domain?” Ding Xiang stood on the spot while his eyes were filled with shock and disbelief. He said, “I heard that a Sword Emperor appeared in the southern territory. It seems like that Sword Emperor possesses the Enlightened Sword Heart and has comprehended both Sword Intent and Sword Domain. Could that have been him?”

In next to no time, a ferocious expression covered Ding Xiang’s face again, and he said, “No matter if you’re the Sword Emperor or the Martial God, I’m going to burn your bones and scatter your ashes today!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Ding Xiang’s figure flashed and chased after Yang Ye.

...

“I never imagined that someone in this world would actually be able to go against Exalt Realm experts while at the Spirit Realm!” As Yang Ye fled swiftly, Ding Shaoyao gazed at Yang Ye while she rested in his arms and spoke softly.

“He’s very strong, and he didn’t utilize the energy of space. Otherwise, I might have really left you!” Yang Ye said, “You’ve seen the situation we’re in. Killing him is impossible. So, think of a way to get out of this. Otherwise, we might be pursued by that geezer forever.”

Ding Shaoyao remained silent for a moment before she said, “Head to the Ding Clan. Even though he’s acting as the patriarch of the Ding Clan right now, he wouldn’t dare act against me in the open. He’ll have to hold back from acting against us if we return to the Ding Clan. We can think about how to deal with him then. However, you have to speed up. Otherwise, he might catch up to us before we leave Still Ridge!”

“We can’t head to the Ocean of Anarchy like this!” Yang Ye shook his head.

“Why?” Ding Shaoyao was puzzled.

“There are three fellows waiting for me at the Ocean of Anarchy. Every single one of them isn’t inferior to that old geezer, understand?” said Yang Ye.

“Luo Jun sent them for you?” asked Ding Shaoyao. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“Good guess!” Yang Ye said, “If we head to the Ocean of Anarchy on my sword like this, then those three geezers will definitely be able to notice me. At that time, we would truly be finished. So, think of another way out.”

“There’s no other way!” Ding Shaoyao said, “There are only two paths now. The first is to kill Ding Xiang, and the second is to let him kill us! Don’t even think of working together or making compromise with him. You killed his only son, so he wouldn’t spare you even if you’re Luo Jun. So, Sword Emperor, reveal your full strength and kill him!”

“Why are you so sure that I’m definitely able to kill him?” Yang Ye lowered his head to gaze at her, and he was truly quite curious. Because she seemed to be very confident in him, and she seemed even more confident than he was!

“If just a single fifth rank Exalt Realm profounder could kill you, then it would be impossible for you to have survived until now, and Luo Jun wouldn’t dispatch 3 experts at the fifth rank of the Exalt Realm or above to deal with you. The reason you aren’t killing Ding Xiang is none other than because of two things. Firstly, you don’t want to pay some sort of price and don’t want to expose some trump cards of yours. Simply speaking, you don’t trust me, right?” said Ding Shaoyao.

Yang Ye took a deep glance at her and said, “I hope you remember your promise. Otherwise, I can guarantee that no matter how monstrously intelligent you are, I’ll still be able to kill you!”

Ding Shaohao revealed a slight grin on her pale face, and then she said, “Do it a little lighter!”

Yang Ye’s eyelids twitched, and then he laughed bitterly. She really is too intelligent! I wonder if working together with such a person is fortune or misfortune for me. Yang Ye stopped thinking about that. He stretched out his hand to the back of Ding Shaoyao’s head, and then she struck it lightly, causing the latter’s eyes to instantly close slowly.

Yang Ye’s figure flashed to the ground, and then he placed Ding Shaoyao at the side.

He’d just put her down when Ding Xiang appeared behind him. A wisp of bewilderment flashed through Ding Xiang’s eyes when he saw that Yang Ye was actually not running anymore. He said, “What? Aren’t you going to continue running? Are you prepared to give your life away?”

Since Yang Ye had stopped running, then there was definitely a reason. So, Ding Xiang didn’t dare act carelessly and thus didn’t attack at the first possible moment.

Yang Ye turned around to gaze at Ding Xiang, and then he shook his head and said, “You just had to knock at death’s door. Wasn’t it just your son? You seem to be full of energy. Wouldn’t it be easier to just have another one? Is it even necessary to pursue me constantly and insist on killing me? I look down on you for being so narrow minded!”

“Bastard! That was my only son! You kill my only son! I swear that I’ll kill you today!” Ding Xiang held the large axe in his hand as he flashed forward, and he left an afterimage behind as he shot explosively towards Yang Ye.

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed a little when Ding Xiang arrived before him, and then he swiftly stomped his right foot on the ground and roared furiously. “Sword Domain!”

As soon as he spoke, Ding Xiang’s figure stiffened for a moment, and his speed descended by a few times. Ding Xiang’s expression changed. He naturally didn’t dare underestimate the Sword Domain, so the profound energy within him surged violently as he flicked his wrist, and countless rays of light shot out violently from his axe. However, these rays of light had been instantly dispersed into nothingness by the mysterious force in the surroundings.

A wisp of a ferocious expression flashed through Ding Xiang’s eyes, and he was just about to attack. However, right at this moment, 3 black clothed figures suddenly appeared here. Ding Xiang was horrified when he saw them because he noticed that all 3 of them were actually Exalt Realm experts!

The 3 of them flashed like bolts of lightning towards Ding Xiang, and it caused his expression to change drastically before his figure flashed away. However, it was a bit too late, and Hong’s dagger had left a long bloody gash on Ding Xiang’s chest.

Ding Xiang stood in midair as he gazed at Yang Ye as if he were looking at a monster. He said, “3 Exalt Realm experts! No, impossible! How... how did they appear here? Wait! That’s not right! They aren’t alive! You are actually able to control Exalt Realm experts as puppets! How did you accomplish that...?”

“Go to hell and ask your son!” Yang Ye issued a command in his heart, and then a strand of dazzling light erupted from the blue sword chest on his back, and then four swords immediately appeared around Ding Xiang.

In the next moment, the four swords spun swiftly, and then countless rays of light instantly enveloped the space around Ding Xiang. After that, Ding Xiang’s shrill and miserable cry suddenly resounded within the area enveloped by the rays of light created by those swords.

Yang Ye instantly heaved a sigh of relief when he heard that shrill cry. However, right at this moment, an unexpected event occurred because a figure had suddenly flashed out from within the light, and it was exactly Ding Xiang. At this moment, Ding Xiang’s entire body was densely covered in injuries and blood, and he seemed extremely miserable.

After he fled the sword formation, Ding Xiang didn’t even spare Yang Ye a glance before he tore space open and flashed towards the distance.

Yang Ye’s face that was ghastly pale from overusing his strength had changed when he witnessed this scene.
