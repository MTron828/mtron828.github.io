Chapter 2305 – Mad Again!

Right when the chopper was about to descend upon Butcher’s head, Yang Ye’s figure was blasted away. But it only took a moment for Yang Ye to stop. It was because Wang Erya had appeared behind him. She placed her palms behind his back and forcefully used her own physical strength to stop him.

However, it was clearly not easy for her, and her face had turned slightly pale.

Once Yang Ye’s figure had stopped, Wang Erya lowered her hands, and then she patted Yang Ye’s thighs, “Madman Yang, fight him! I support you!”

Bai Zhixian felt speechless.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye was about to attack again, but Bai Zhixian hurriedly appeared in front of him and stopped him. Bai Zhixian shook her head and gazed at Butcher, “Senior, I’ll buy it.”

She was about to give him her Eternal Crystals while she spoke.

Suddenly, Butcher clawed at Bai Zhixian from afar, and a wave of powerful energy instantly enveloped her. An instant later, Butcher waved his right hand lightly, and Bai Zhixian was instantly blasted over 30m away. At the same time, a wave of powerful energy locked onto her, causing her to be unable to move at all.

Butcher lowered his hand and pulled up his sleeves, “Little girl, this isn’t a matter of crystals anymore. Fuck! He actually dared to steal from me! It’s the first time I’ve encountered something like this in my entire life! I’m going to chop off his third leg today!”

Butcher’s face was suddenly covered in shock when he spoke up to this point.

Everyone gazed at Yang Ye.

Ferocity had instantly covered Yang Ye’s face when Bai Zhixian had been pushed away, and then his figure started to tremble violently. A wave of terrifying intent suddenly swept out from him!

Madness intent!

An instant later, Yang Ye appeared in front of Butcher, and then the chopped descended straight down.

Butcher didn’t try to dodge and just pointed a finger upward.

It pressed straight against Yang Ye’s chopper. However, a strand of blood sprayed, and then Butcher was pushed a few steps back!

The slovenly old man’s eyes were filled with disbelief from the sight of this.

All the other villagers were stunned as well.

Butcher’s eyes were filled with disbelief as well, “Impossible… Wait! Madness… madness intent… it’s so damn powerful when used with a blade?”

Yang Ye suddenly appeared above Butcher, and then his blade descended toward Butcher once.

It was the same chopper from before!

With the help of his madness intent’s, Yang Ye’s attack wasn’t any weaker than when he used his Sword Domain!

Everywhere his blade descended, a long mark appeared in space.

Butcher still didn’t dodge, and he just raised his hand and swung a punch. It slammed straight against the chopper in Yang Ye’s grasp.

Bang!

A muffled explosion resounded, and then Yang Ye was blasted away. It only took a moment for Wang Erya to appear behind him, but she wasn’t able to stop him immediately this time. As soon as her palms pressed against his back, they were pushed over 100m away.

As soon as he stopped himself, a wisp of blood seeped out from the corner of Yang Ye’s mouth.

But just a moment later, Yang Ye vanished on the spot again, and he was in front of Butcher when he appeared once more.

Butcher didn’t dodge and swung a punch once more.

An instant later, a figure was blasted away again.

Wang Erya was stunned, and then she moved aside and just allowed Yang Ye to slam against the ground.

Everyone gazed at Wang Erya, and the latter smiled with embarrassment and walked over to Yang Ye’s side, “Madman Yang, just forget it. You’re no match for him, so let’s…”

Suddenly, Yang Ye vanished on the spot.

Everyone who witnessed this was stunned speechless.

Just like that, Yang Ye was blasted away, over and over again.

He was being completely suppressed!

Butcher’s strength completely overwhelmed Yang Ye, but Yang Ye’s fearlessness in battle still filled the spectators with shock.

He really seemed like he was unafraid of death!

“You’re a bully!” Right when Yang Ye was blasted away again, Bai Zhixian suddenly gazed at Butcher, “Do you dare to suppress your cultivation and fight him fairly?”

Wang Erya hurriedly chimed in, “Yeah! Butcher, do you dare to fight him in a fair fight?”

“Exactly! Fight him fairly! Butcher, do you dare to fight that kid in a fair fight?” Some others chimed in from the surroundings.

“Fair? Ptooey!” Butcher replied angrily, “I’m not the one who wants to bully him, it’s he who wants to steal from me and even kill me. All of you…”

“Hmph!” Wang Erya grunted coldly, “If you’re afraid, then just say so. Butcher, stop making excuses! I think you’re afraid that Madman Yang will beat you up if you suppress your cultivation, right?”

Butcher glared fiercely at Wang Erya, “I didn’t know you learned how to egg people on. Sooner or later, you’re going to become as terrible as that grandfather of yours.”

Wang Erya made faces at him and said, “If you’re afraid, just admit it!”

Butcher grunted coldly, “I’m afraid? Just watch! I’m not just going to suppress my cultivation, I’m going to seal my profound energy! I’ll bash him to death with just my fists!”

As he spoke, his aura suddenly weakened, and even his profound energy fell completely silent.

The Progenitor Realm!

At this moment, Butcher had forcefully suppressed himself at the Progenitor Realm. Even then, the pressure he emanated was even stronger than a True Dao Realm expert!

Butcher gestured at Yang Ye, “Bring it!”Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Yang Ye crawled up slowly from the ground, and then a ray of cold light flashed.

A blade that carried a strand of cold light instantly appeared before Butcher’s forehead.

However, two fingers clamped down on the blade, and it was just those fingers that completely immobilized the chopped that emanated madness intent!

Butcher laughed coldly, “Kid, you’re still too young! I…”

Suddenly, a black sword appeared in Yang Ye’s left grasp, and then it shot horizontally at Butcher.

Swish!

A sharp and ear=piercing swish shot through space.

Butcher’s expression remained unchanged. He released Yang Ye’s chopped, and then tapped the tip of his foot lightly against the ground and moved over 3m back. But just a moment later, his figure shot forward once more.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye’s figure suddenly turned ethereal, and then he released the chopped and swung his sword with both hands.

The Sword Domain!

Bang!

Butcher was instantly blasted over 30m away! Moreover, a deep mark had appeared on his palm!

The shock and excitement in the spectators’ eyes grew from the sight of this.

They were excited because it was the first time they saw Butcher suffer something like this, and they were shocked because Yang Ye was so strong!

Butcher glanced at the mark on his palm, and then he looked up at Yang Ye, “Damn! Interesting! You…”

His voice stopped abruptly because Yang Ye had vanished on the spot, and a ray of light flashed.

Butcher’s eyes narrowed slightly, and he raised his palms and clapped them together. At the instant they clapped together, a sword was forcefully clamped down upon. However, a figure suddenly appeared behind Butcher, and then a chopper blade cleaved down at the back of his head. Butcher’s expression remained unchanged, and he grabbed Yang Ye’s black sword and flicked it backward.

Clang!

As soon as sword and blade collided, the limestone floor beneath their feet instantly exploded apart, and a wave of powerful force rippled toward the surroundings. However, it hadn’t even been able to ripple more than 3m away before a wave of mysterious energy erased it from existence.

Suddenly, the black sword in Butcher’s grasp shook violently, and then it transformed into countless vengeful spirits that enveloped him.

Bang!

A wave of powerful energy suddenly rippled out from within them, and they were instantly blasted away. However, Yang Ye suddenly appeared in front of Butcher, and then Yang Ye chopped at Butcher with both hands!

He just chopped rapidly like a madman!

There was no technique to it, or any moves!

He was just chopping at random!

But it was exactly this random hacking at Butcher which forced Butch back repeatedly. Moreover, a sword was ceaselessly flashing and causing great trouble for Butcher. The reason it was troublesome for Butcher was because Yang Ye’s sword and blade could slice through his defenses! Moreover, he’d overdone it by saying he wouldn’t use profound energy and only use his fists… So, Butcher was in a very embarrassing situation!

Just like that, Butcher was gradually suppressed in battle, and many marks had started to appear throughout his body.

At this moment, the most outstanding wasn’t Yang Ye but his blade! Randomly hacking and chopping with a blade wasn’t considered saber technique at all, but its strength and effects were extremely terrifying!

Swing after swing which was sometimes accompanied by the flash of a sword, and it truly made Butcher suffer!

The most terrifying part was that Yang Ye’s madness intent was actually growing stronger and stronger!

As it grew in strength, Yang Ye’s Madness Saber Technique grew stronger as well.

The village had fallen silent.

Everyone was looking at Yang Ye.

Yang Ye’s madness intent was growing stronger and stronger…

Finally…

Bang!

An explosion resounded, and Butcher was blasted over 100m away. His body was covered in injuries. He glanced at his hands, and he noticed blade injuries all over them, causing his expression to grow quite unsightly, “Dammit! I overdid it this time!”

Right when everyone thought that Yang Ye would continue attacking Butcher, Yang Ye suddenly turned around and charged at the spectators.

Bai Zhixian’s face turned pale, “He’s gone mad again…”
