Chapter 414 – Back To The Treasure Gathering Room!

Yang Ye gazed at the white dragon as he said, “Do you still remember the agreement we made?”

The white dragon nodded and said, “I’ll stay with you once we leave, and I’ll obey you temporarily and won’t rashly show myself.”

Yang Ye nodded, and then he stretched out his right hand. A strand of violet light surged out and instantly enveloped the white dragon. After that, it vanished on the spot and appeared within the tiny vortex.

The reason he dared to promise the white dragon that he would take it with him was naturally because of the tiny vortex. Because the so-called restrictions that the white dragon spoke of would definitely be useless once he placed the white dragon into the tiny vortex. In any case, up until now, he hadn’t seen a single thing that could resist the tiny vortex.

Of course, the problem of the white dragon forcefully seizing the tiny vortex from him hadn’t eluded him. If it were in the past, he wouldn’t let the white dragon know of the tiny vortex’s existence even if he had to abandon these treasures and the chance to obtain an extraordinary expert that would fight on his behalf. But now, after he found out that an extraordinarily terrifying little girl resided in the tiny vortex, he naturally wasn’t afraid of that anymore!

He’d personally witnessed how terrifying the little girl was and how mysterious and terrifying the tiny vortex was. So, unless the tiny vortex willingly abandoned and left him, then others would absolutely be courting death if they tried to seize it by force, especially if they tried to do so while residing within it. This applied even if the white dragon was a Monarch Realm expert!

After the white dragon entered the tiny vortex, it was first stunned, and then it became overjoyed and started to move about incessantly within the tiny vortex. In next to no time, the tiny vortex seemed to be unable to bear the sight of it anymore, and a strand of terrifying aura enveloped the white dragon. After that, Yang Ye watched with astonishment as the white dragon acted just like the Darkbeasts in the past. It revealed a terrified expression as well!

At this moment, tremendous waves were surging through Yang Ye’s heart because he noticed that the tiny vortex seemed to be even more terrifying than he’d imagined. My god! That white dragon is a Monarch Realm expert, but it still revealed such a terrified expression when facing the tiny vortex. What exactly is the tiny vortex? Why would even Monarch Realm experts feel extremely terrified of it?

No matter what, it was a good thing in the end. Earlier, he was still quite worried that the tiny vortex wouldn’t be able to keep the white dragon in check, but now it would seem that his worried were unnecessary!

Xiao Yuxi suddenly asked. “You placed him into that place?”

Yang Ye nodded. He naturally wouldn’t keep it from Xiao Yuxi.

Xiao Yuxi nodded lightly and then fell silent.

Yang Ye walked over to her side, stretched out his hand and grabbed hers, and then he said in a light voice, “Why don’t you ask me what is that place?”

He was very curious. Because logically speaking, she should be very curious. However, Xiao Yuxi had never asked about it, and it made him feel very puzzled.

“That’s a secret of yours!” Xiao Yuxi tightened her grip on Yang Ye’s hand and said in a light voice, “If you are willing to tell me about it, then you would take the initiative to tell me; if you are unwilling, then you wouldn’t tell me even if I asked!”

Yang Ye was slightly moved by this, and he tightened his grip on Xiao Yuxi’s hand as well while he said, “I’ve never thought of keeping it from you after I placed you there at that time. The reason I didn’t tell you about it is even I don’t know what exactly it is. I merely know that it’s within me, and it has no ill intent towards me. I don’t know anything else about it!”

“You don’t have to explain!” Xiao Yuxi glanced at Yang Ye and said in a light voice, “If I trust you, then I would believe you even if you lied; if I don’t trust you, then I wouldn’t believe you even if you told me the truth!”

Yang Ye was stunned, and he had a sweet feeling in his heart as if it was filled with honey. So being trusted and especially being trusted by someone I like is so nice!

“What a waste of the dense Spirit Energy that’s here!” Xiao Yuxi revealed an expression of pity that couldn’t be disguised as she gazed at the milky white mist in the surroundings. The Spirit Energy here was too dense, and it was dense to the point of taking material form. If she could cultivate here, then she was confident in her ability to charge into the Exalt Realm as soon as possible!

Yang Ye gazed at the white mist in the surroundings and pondered deeply for a moment before he gradually circulated the tiny vortex within him. As it started to spin, Yang Ye was quickly pleasantly surprised because he noticed that the milky white mist in the surroundings had started to surge into his body. Moreover, the white mist wasn’t refined and absorbed upon entering his body, and it floated within the tiny vortex instead....

The tiny vortex slowly started spinning faster and faster, and the milky white mist in the surroundings started to surge madly into Yang Ye. In less than 15 minutes, the entire space within the tiny vortex had been filled with the white mist. Just like how it was in the white dragon’s abode, the white mist hadn’t dispersed!

Yang Ye was really extremely excited when he saw the white mist in the space within the tiny vortex. Because from now onward, the space within his tiny vortex was equivalent to a paradise of cultivation. Regardless of whether it was Darkbeasts or humans, they would be able to improve their cultivations at an alarming speed. Moreover, it was the same for him. He wouldn’t have to worry about Spirit Energy anymore no matter where he went!

Xiao Yuxi watched all of this with astonishment. Yes, she was extremely shocked right now because Yang Ye had actually sucked all the Spirit Energy away, and it was an extremely abnormal feat.

She was very curious and bewildered, but she didn’t ask in the end. She refused to ask about that mysterious place that she’d stayed at in the past. Because every single time another person found out about it, the more danger Yang Ye would be in!

“Yuxi, cultivate in there with the little fellow from now on!” said Yang Ye with a smile on his face.

If Xiao Yuxi cultivated there with the little fellow, then she would definitely be able to improve her strength greatly. Especially the little fellow, he’d already sensed that the little fellow seemed to be on the verge of waking up. Actually, the injuries the little fellow suffered at that time had been healed a long time ago, and the reason the little fellow still hadn’t woken up was probably because her strength was about to improve again.

Xiao Yuxi glanced at Yang Ye before she nodded.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly frowned. When he thought about the little fellow, he’d recalled something else at the same time, and it was the Immortal Binding Rope which Mu Jun had utilized that day. He’d personally witnessed the strength of the Immortal Binding Rope. It was even capable of restraining the little fellow, so how could it not be terrifying? However, he hadn’t noticed the Immortal Binding Rope when he searched Mu Jun’s spatial ring that day!

Could it be on him?

When he thought up to this point, Yang Ye waved his hand, and the ancient sheath’s Sword Spirit appeared here. Yang Ye didn’t exchange pleasantries with her and said, “Bring that fellow, Mu Jun, out here!”

He hadn’t placed Mu Jun and Mo Qingyu within the tiny vortex because he still didn’t trust the Sword Spirit of the ancient sheath.

After he asked the Sword Spirit to bring Mu Jun to him, he directly asked. “Where did you put the Immortal Binding Rope?”

Because of the Soul Puppetry technique, Mu Jun naturally answered him obediently. “Master, it’s on this Sword Servant’s waist!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he muttered a few words, and then a golden rope instantly appeared on his waist.

So it was on him! Yang Ye made a gesture, and then the rope instantly flew into his palm. Yang Ye couldn’t help but smile while he gazed at this rope that was made of unknown material. After all, it was an extraordinary treasure. If he utilized it against an enemy and that enemy was unable to resist it, then that enemy would definitely perish!

In short, how could he not be happy when he obtained another treasure?

Xiao Yuxi glanced at Mu Jun before she said, “He seems to be controlled by some sort of mysterious technique. You should change his appearance, otherwise, if the Exalted Han Empire were to find out about it, then they would absolutely not allow their Crown Prince to become another’s puppet.”

Yang Ye restrained the smile on his face upon hearing this, and he revealed a solemn expression. He was shocked at the same time because he seemed to have constantly forgotten about the powers that stood behind Mo Qingyu and Mu Jun. The powers that stood behind them were existences that were even more formidable than a sect like the Origin School. Fortunately, Xiao Yuxi had reminded him of it, otherwise, he might have to face a huge amount of trouble in the future!

Yang Ye glanced at Mu Jun before he thought to himself. Looks like I have to get a set of equipment for this fellow and Mo Qingyu once I leave this place!Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings. When he confirmed that the surroundings were completely empty, Yang Ye didn’t stay here any longer, and he held Xiao Yuxi’s hand as he left the white dragon’s abode.

After he arrived above ground, Yang Ye swept the surroundings with his gaze, and once he confirmed that there was nothing unusual in the surroundings, he immediately released the Ninth Hell Cold Gale and held Xiao Yuxi in his arms as he flashed towards Ancient Domain City.

Yang Ye and Xiao Yuxi had just left when Xiao Tianji suddenly appeared where Yang Ye was standing just moments ago. He gazed at the direction Yang Ye left towards while he shook his head slowly. “The young are truly careless!”

As soon as he finished speaking, his figure suddenly vanished on the spot before a shrill and miserable cry resounded from within the valley.

Xiao Tianji hovered in midair above a mountain wall while he gazed at the corpse of an old man that laid on the mountain wall. He shook his head slowly and said, “Greed.... You wouldn’t have died if you chose to notify those fellows in Ancient Domain City immediately. Unfortunately, you didn’t for the sake of gain. So, you’re dead!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Xiao Tianji waved his hand, and then the old man’s corpse instantly transformed into a pile of powder.

......

Outside Ancient Domain City.

Yang Ye gazed at Xiao Yuxi as he said, “Yuxi, go in that space. The curse that inflicted you has just been eliminated, so you need to improve your cultivation and increase your lifespan!”

Xiao Yuxi glanced at Yang Ye and said in a light voice, “You must allow me to leave at any moment!”

She was afraid that Yang Ye wouldn’t let her leave when he encountered danger and would insist on facing it himself!

Yang Ye nodded and said, “Don’t worry, we’ll face everything together!”

Xiao Yuxi finally nodded when she heard this.

Yang Ye didn’t hesitate to wave his hand, and then a violet glow flashed before he placed Xiao Yuxi within the tiny vortex.

After that, Yang Ye turned around and walked towards Ancient Domain City. He was about to return to the southern territory, so he naturally had to prepare. After all, his journey back to the southern territory would be extremely dangerous. So, he was prepared to get some top-rate equipment in Ancient Domain City for those 105 assassins!

In any case, he was rich now!

However, he was still slightly perturbed in his heart. Because besides getting some equipment, he had another objective when he returned to Ancient Domain City this time, and it was to see An Biru.

Even though they didn’t know each other very well, they’d still done it, and he was unable to forget her and act as if nothing had happened. So, besides obtaining some equipment, he’d come to see her for one last time as well.

Before long, Yang Ye had arrived at the Treasure Gathering Room again!
