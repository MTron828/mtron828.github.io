Chapter 1877 – An Instant!

Together!

Yang Ye wasn’t showing off on purpose. He wanted to see exactly what level his strength was at.

Presently, he hadn’t just attained the 6th stage of the True Realm, he’d merged everything he’d learned in the past. So, he could be said to be completely different now. However, the only way to find out his exact strength was to test it on someone!

The armored man spoke coldly, “Yang Ye, do you think you’re invincible because you attained the 6th stage of the True Realm?”

The Elegant Exalt spoke indifferently, “As soon as they accomplish a little, some people…”

Suddenly, a sword howl resounded.

Hiss! Hiss!

Two rays of sword energy flashed.

Boom! Boom!

An instant later, the Elegant Exalt and the armored man were blasted 3km away. But Yang Ye was still on the spot! However, there was an ethereal sword floating on his right and left.

Threads of sword energy!

It was a technique he’d learned in the Sword Sect, but as his strength grew, it was gradually unable to keep up. So, he had no choice but to abandon it. Yet now, he’d researched and modified it, allowing it to undergo a qualitative transformation.

The armored man and the Elegant Exalt exchanged glances, and they saw shock in their eyes.

Yang Ye had actually casually pushed them back!

They felt disbelief!

Suddenly, an ethereal sword appeared below Yang Ye’s feet, and then a ray of light flashed.

It didn’t make a sound.

The Elegant Exalt and armored man’s expressions changed drastically, and two powerful auras swept out from them.

Boom! Boom!

In an instant, two explosions resounded, and they were blasted backwards.

Meanwhile, a sword howl resounded.

It hadn’t been created now, and it was from the previous attack.

He’d attacked, yet it didn’t make a sound until now!

He’d only been able to do this with Split Second, yet now, he didn’t need to use Split Second. Any attack of his could have the same effect, and they were even faster than Split Second!

The Elegant Exalt and the armored man’s expressions were extremely solemn. They knew Yang Ye’s strength had improved tremendously, but they hadn’t imagined it to have improved this much!

The Elegant Exalt was about to attack when Yang Ye suddenly said, “Elegant Exalt, the Asura Exalt returned my second sister’s Quintessence Blood Pearl, and I’m grateful to him for that. So, let me say a few extra words. His death had nothing to do with me.”

The Elegant Exalt gazed coldly at Yang Ye, “All I know is that he’s dead, but you’re alive!”

Yang Ye shook his head, “Even if he’s dead, it wasn’t my doing. So, if you really want revenge, you should look for the person who killed him.”

The Elegant Exalt laughed coldly, “Of course I will. However, I’ll kill you first. You…”

Suddenly, the swords by Yang Ye’s side vanished, and then they appeared a few inches away from the Elegant Exalt’s forehead. The powerful energy contained within them caused the space around them to be sliced apart.

It wasn’t that his energy had leaked out, and it had been caused by the swords’ speed. Space couldn’t endure their speed!

The Elegant Exalt’s expression changed drastically when she saw Yang Ye’s attack was so fast. However, her reaction wasn’t slow at all. A palm-sized pearl suddenly appeared on her forehead, and then a ray of white light swept out.

Boom!

The swords were obliterated, but the Elegant Exalt was blasted backwards. Suddenly, a few dozen swords appeared around her, and they were spinning rapidly. The powerful sword energy contained within them enveloped her.

The Elegant Exalt’s expression changed drastically, and she looked up at the armored man, “Are you still not going to join forces with me?”

The armored man pondered deeply for a moment, and then he grabbed his spear and swung it forward.

Hiss!

A powerful strand of energy swept towards Yang Ye’s swords. Even though it didn’t destroy Yang Ye’s energy swords, it stopped the swords, providing the Elegant Exalt some room to catch her breath.

Once the Elegant Exalt was saved, she didn’t attack again. She turned around and transformed into a dark ray of light that vanished into the sky.

This sudden turn of events shocked both Yang Ye and the armored man.

She’d fled?

The Elegant Exalt actually fled?

She naturally had to flee. As soon as she fought Yang Ye, she knew that they couldn’t kill him. Not only were they unable to kill him; they might be killed instead. So, she’d decisively chosen to run!

The armored man’s face was extremely unsightly when he saw the Elegant Exalt flee.

Yang Ye looked in the direction she’d fled towards. He hesitated for a moment and didn’t choose to give chase. If he chased after her and was willing to pay a small price, he could catch up to her. But it wasn’t necessary. He gazed at the armored man instead.

Why had he been pursued by countless experts? The main reason was this armored man. So, he felt that he should put an end to it.

The armored man glanced coldly at Yang Ye and said, “Yang Ye, you stole the Sovereign of Man’s sword, and he won’t let you go!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he turned around with the intent to leave.

However, an energy sword appeared around 10m away from him.

The armored man’s face fell. He gazed at Yang Ye, “What? You intend to kill me? Do you realize that I’m the Sovereign of Man’s…”

Suddenly, Yang Ye waved his hand and interrupted the armored man, “The Sovereign of Man? Who does he think he is?”

As soon as he finished speaking, he issued a command in his heart.

Hiss!

The sword before the armored man shot forward like a bolt of lightning!

The armored man’s pupils constricted slightly. He hadn’t expected Yang Ye to actually not give face to the Sovereign of Man and dare to kill him. At this moment, he was very well aware that the only way to survive was to rely on his own strength.

He flipped his palm, and his spear stabbed forward.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye had his hands behind his back and didn’t move. However, numerous swords were ceaselessly flickering around the armored man.

The Sword Control Technique. He was able to control them with his heart. So, he didn’t have to control the swords with his hand. He was slowly getting used to controlling them with his heart!

The armored man was smart. He didn’t allow himself to get locked in battle with the swords, and he looked for an opportunity to shoot towards Yang Ye. Because he was very well aware that if he didn’t deal with Yang Ye, then those swords would be endless. If this situation continued for long, he would be exhausted to death!

Yang Ye’s expression didn’t change at all when the armored man arrived before him. He didn’t raise his sword, and he just pressed his index and middle fingers together before tapping them forward.

Sword energy flickered on the tip of his finger!

Point at the Heavens!

It was a technique he’d obtained from Jian Wuji’s inheritance. Point at the heavens, and the heavens shall cease to exist! It was a move made specially for Eyes of the Heaven Dao. However, just like other sword techniques, he’d gradually forgotten it. But while he cultivated in the Primordial Pagoda, he’d picked it up again, and then he noticed that it had many advantages. So, he modified it slowly and merged it with his other techniques!

So, a new technique was born!

Sword Point!

Bang!

The armored man was blasted 3km away. At the same time, Yang Ye suddenly flicked his fingers at the armored man.

Hiss!

The space before him was sliced open before a ray of sword energy instantly shot out from there.

Void Flash!

He used to use it solely for escaping. Yet now, he’d modified it into a lethal move!

The sudden ray of light made the armored man’s expression change drastically. However, his reaction wasn’t slow. He immediately raised his spear and swung it. But because he was caught off guard, he hadn’t been able to put his full strength in the attack.

Bang!

The sword energy was blasted apart while the armored man was blasted away like a shooting star.

“It’s over!” Suddenly, Yang Ye’s voice resounded. In an instant, the space in an area of 500km around Yang Ye suddenly trembled. After that, Yang Ye didn’t make a single sound as he appeared a few meters behind the armored man.

An instant later, a sword howl resounded.

The sword flashed by, killed its target, and only then did the sound of it resound!

The Sword Domain!

Yang Ye had used the Sword Domain, but he hadn’t used the Invincible Sword Domain, and he’d used Split Second instead!

However, it wasn’t the same technique anymore, and it was one that used the Sword Domain as its foundation. He was like a god while he stood within the Sword Domain. Of course, it didn’t mean that he was truly invincible. After all, when his opponent’s strength far surpassed his own, they could destroy his Domain.

There was no absolute form of invincibility, and there was no truly invincible person!

In the Sword Domain, he could sense everything clearly and use everything within it. Like space and the Laws. Simply speaking, when he executed Split Second while within the Sword Domain, it was equivalent to raising the technique to a higher level.

Moreover, he hadn’t just used Split Second. That attack carried the Sword Point, Void Flash, Heavenrend’s method to use explosive force, and various other Laws…

The armored man’s body stiffened behind Yang Ye as he stared blankly ahead, “I didn’t expect your sword to have arrived at such a level…”

As soon as he finished speaking, his head tilted to the side and fell off his neck.

Suddenly, the space above Yang Ye trembled, and then an ethereal man in a yellow robe appeared in there.

A projection!

Suddenly, the golden sword within the Primordial Pagoda shook violently and wanted to charge out of it.

The Sovereign of Man!

At this moment, Yang Ye knew who the man was!Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com
