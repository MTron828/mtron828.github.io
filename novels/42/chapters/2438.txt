Chapter 2439 – Why Don’t You Draw Your Sword?

Five swings of the sword!

The sword cultivator was stunned, and then he shook his head before going around them and walking off into the distance.

He didn’t want to draw his sword at all!

Everyone in Eternal Border had to suppress their cultivations, and he was no exception. He’d suppressed his cultivation because he didn’t want to destroy Eternal Border.

The Emotionless Sword Dao didn’t represent that he had to destroy the world!

Existences like him and Tian Xiu couldn’t be judged based on their realms of cultivation. Or it should be said that their strength had surpassed the limits of the realms of cultivation. Just like some geniuses in the world of mortals, they were able to completely ignore the limits of their age.

While they were all people of the same age, it was undeniable that while that was true, they could have a completely different life.

The sword cultivator and Tian Xiu were such people, and while there weren’t many existences like them in the world, there weren’t few of them either.

Once they arrived in Eternal Kingdom, they didn’t grow weak, and they grew stronger instead.

Because there were rules they didn’t have to abide by anymore once they arrived here.

The white haired old man’s face fell when he saw the sword cultivator walk off.

He’d been ignored!

He’d been ignored again.

The white haired old man figure flashed, and the sword cultivator stopped once more. It was because the old man had appeared in front of him again.

The sword cultivator frowned slightly and was slightly displeased.

The old man gazed at him, “Why don’t you draw your sword?”

The sword cultivator spoke frankly, “You’re weak!”

As far as the sword cultivator was concerned, his enemies should be those like him. For example, the spear-wielding middle aged man in Abyss World, or Void Spirit Maiden of the void spirit race!

The old man’s face turned unsightly when he heard this!

Weak!

A dignified peak Five World Realm expert had actually been called weak! Was he weak?

The old man started laughing from extreme anger, “I’m weak? Come on, I’ll let you attack me five times. No! Ten times! Do it!”

Do it!

The sword cultivator nodded. He didn’t say a word and just drew his sword.

A ray of light rippled out along with his sword.

As soon as it appeared, the old man’s pupils constricted into the size of needles. This attack was so swift!

It was so swift he couldn’t dodge it at all and could only go head-on against it. At this moment, the old man used his full strength because his intuition told him that he would die if he couldn’t stop this attack!

At the moment the old man executed his counterattack, the sword cultivator’s sword was already back in its sheath. After that, he just walked off and vanished into the distance.

Meanwhile, the old man was stunned on the spot for a long time, and then his body suddenly split open!

Blood sprayed!

However, the old man’s soul was still there!

But it was very translucent and seemed like it would vanish at any moment.

The old man stared blankly ahead, “I-Impossible…”

The middle aged men behind him were dumbstruck!

…

At a teleportation passageway.

Yang Ye’s group was still within it. They were standing side by side, and Snowy was on Yang Ye’s shoulder. She had her paws wrapped around Yang Ye’s neck and was snoring with her head resting against his cheek.

Both A’Leng and Huang Ying were quite surprised and envious to see the Sprite Progenitor so close to Yang Ye.

She was the Sprite Progenitor, yet she was so reliant on a human!

Suddenly, a black robed figure appeared before them. The figure bowed slightly to Huang Ying and spoke softly, “Ninth Prince…”

Huang Ying spoke indifferently, “Be frank!”

The black robed figure spoke solemnly, “One of our brothers died while scouting the path ahead!”

Huang Ying frowned, “What happened?”

The black robed figure shook his head, “I don’t know. We just suddenly lost contact with him, and then his soul plaque shattered. Should the rest of us go look ahead?”

Huang Ying fell silent for a short moment and shook his head, “No.”

The black figure nodded and left.

Huang Ying gazed at Yang Ye and A’Leng, “Our troubles are probably about to begin again.”

A’Leng spoke softly, “Which power is it?”

Huang Ying smiled, “There are only two possibilities. My own desolate race, or Eternal Kingdom. At this point in our journey, only my own desolate race and the Eternal Kingdom would dare to interfere in this. The desolate race is trying to stop me because someone clearly doesn’t want me to be the Crown Prince, and the Eternal Kingdom doesn’t want to let me return because they don’t want the Sprite Progenitor to go to the desolate race with me.”

He gazed at Yang Ye and continued, “Brother Yang, I guarantee that I will use my life to protect you and the Sprite Progenitor.”

Needless to say, following him back to the desolate race was a very, very risky thing on Yang Ye’s part.

Because it was very likely for him to enter a trap that he could never escape.

But Yang Ye had no other choice. If he left now, the desolate race would still come for him. Moreover, without A’Leng and Huang Ying, the Eternal Border and Eternal Kingdom… Actually, all the powers throughout the universe would come for him. Yet now, he only had to face the desolate race and Eternal Kingdom. As for whether he could leave the desolate race once he got there, Yang Ye didn’t think too much about it.

After staying with Huang Ying for the last few days, Yang Ye felt this Ninth prince of the desolate race wasn’t bad at all. Since he wasn’t bad, Yang Ye planned to give it a try. Regardless of whether it was him, Huang Ying, or A’Leng, all of them were in the same situation. Moreover, he wanted to see the desolate race that the Eternal Kingdom had crushed all those years ago.

They continued forward, and around an hour passed before a dazzling door of light appeared before them.

They passed through the door and arrived on a plain.

Huang Ying grinned, “This is Life and Death Border, and it can be considered as part of my desolate race’s territory. Every year, countless youths of my desolate race are brought here to temper themselves. There are countless Primal Desolate Beasts and many other beings here. All of them are loyal to my desolate race. The disciples of our race come here to temper themselves and to temper all the existences here.”

A'Leng suddenly asked, “You fight and kill each other?”

Huang Ying shook his head, “Not at all. While such tempering has to be done in the form of deciding life and death, it’s a very good way to temper themselves. Miss A’Leng and Brother Yang, I’m sure you’re aware how cruel this world is. If they do not temper themselves well here, they won’t be able to keep themselves alive in the outside world. Especially when it comes to my desolate race. When the people of my race and our subordinates are weak, we will definitely vanish from history. Since the ancient times, how many powerful organizations, clans, and races have vanished from the annals of history?”

Yang Ye spoke solemnly, “Brother Huang Ying, it Desolate World inferior to the Eternal Kingdom?”

Huang Ying was slightly stunned, and then he chuckled, “If the universe was divided into levels, then my Desolate World would be a medium level world, and the Eternal Universe would be a high level world. As for Eternal Border and some other special worlds, they are low level worlds. As for the rest, they can’t even be ranked.”

Yang Ye was stunned speechless.

Huang Ying continued, “The Eternal Kingdom is a high level world because of Eternal Energy. Besides that, it’s their world itself. It possesses countless smaller worlds and a spirit vein even my desolate race doesn’t possess.”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “A spirit vein?”

Huang Ying nodded, “A huge spirit vein that covers the entire Eternal Kingdom. Eternal Kingdom has three precious treasures. The spirit vein called Divine Spirit, the Sprite Progenitor, and Eternal Energy. It can be said that they are the reason Eternal Kingdom is superior to other worlds. People seek to go higher in life, so Eternal Kingdom is naturally where everyone wishes to go. Because it’s currently the only known place that allows one to advance above the Five World Realm!”

“Wait!” Yang Ye suddenly asked, “Your desolate race doesn’t have any experts above the Five World Realm?”

“We do!” Huang Ying spoke softly, “My ancestor!”

Yang Ye was stunned, “Just one?”

Huang Ying nodded, “Or to be more precise, my ancestor is the type of person who isn’t limited by cultivation.”

Yang Ye spoke solemnly, “But if I’m not wrong, Eternal Kingdom should have experts above the Five World Realm, right?”

Huang Ying nodded slightly, “They do, but not many. Of course, they are much more numerous than my desolate race or any other world.”

Yang Ye asked, “So, the Eternal Kingdom’s strength is greater than the desolate race?”

Huang Ying grinned, “It has always been like that. I know what you’re confused about. Eternal Kingdom’s overall strength is stronger than my desolate race, but we have our own trump cards!”

Yang Ye glanced at him and sensibly chose to avoid pursuing an answer.Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Huang Ying smiled and looked into the distance, “Flying is prohibited here. We’ll be attacked by the formation here if we do, and it’s no ordinary formation.”

As he spoke, he gazed at Yang Ye and A’Leng, “Once we get through this place, we’ll have arrived in my desolate race. My father and the elders who support me are waiting at the end of this area. So long as I get through this area, I’ll be the Crown Prince. At that time, besides my ancestor, the Desolate Emperor, I’ll have the greatest authority in the desolate race, and I’ll have the authority to give orders to all the experts of my desolate race besides my ancestor!”

A’Leng glanced at him and fell silent.

Yang Ye spoke softly, “Allow me to be honest, the heart of man is complicated.”

Huang Ying smiled, “I agree.”

He walked over to them and continued, “Brother Yang, Miss A’Leng, today may be our final day. So, why don’t we become sworn siblings?”

“Sworn siblings?” Both of them exchanged glances and gazed at Huang Ying.

Huang Ying raised his hand, “I, Huang Ying, swear on my soul that I will never betray both of you…”

Suddenly, Yang Ye shook his head, “It isn’t necessary.”

They gazed at him.

Yang Ye continued softly, “Regardless of whether it’s between brothers or friends, it all depends on the heart and the person itself, not an oath. If we get along, we’ll be friends and like brothers, and we really are like that, why would we need an oath?”

He gazed at Huang Ying, “Brother Huang Ying, we’ll naturally find out if we’re brothers or enemies once we get into the desolate race, right?”

A'Leng suddenly said, “That’s true.”

Huang Ying roared with laughter, “That’s absolutely true! Friends and brothers don’t need any oaths!”

After all, true friends and brothers never needed any oaths between them.
