Chapter 127 – The Number One Exper

Yang Ye was shocked by this furious shout to the point of hastily letting the white fox go, and his heart jerked when he saw that it was glaring furiously at him. Earlier, he’d merely felt that this white colored fellow before him was cute, yet he’d forgotten that it was an existence comparable to a Spirit Realm expert. Moreover, it was even a woman!

Yang Ye smiled embarrassedly and said, “Sorry, it won’t happen again!”

“Do you know that you can’t touch the tail of a fox?” The white fox stared Yang Ye in the eye while its voice carried a trace of ghastly coldness.

“Why?” Yang Ye was puzzled. “I always embrace the little fellow, and I’ve touched its tail!”

The fox gazed at Yang Ye for a short while, and when it noticed that Yang Ye didn’t seem like he was lying, it immediately glanced coldly at Yang Ye before transforming into a ray of white light that entered Yang Ye’s body. At the same time, a voice suddenly appeared by Yang Ye’s ear. “Right, I forgot to tell you that I have quite a few enemies. Like the Grand Qin Empire, the Flower Palace, the Snow Palace. In short, all the renowned powers in the southern territory seem to be my enemies. If they know that I’ve made an appearance, then they’ll definitely not let me live. So, for the sake of our safety, it’s best that you don’t offend a Spirit Realm expert in the future, and even if you do offend one, it’s best that you don’t ask me to lend you a hand. Because once I do, then you’ll become the public enemy of the entire southern territory!”

As soon as she finished speaking, the scene before Yang Ye’s eyes gradually blurred.

At this moment, Yang Ye thought in his heart. I’ve been tricked!

After a few breaths of mine, when Yang Ye opened his eyes once more, he’d returned to the chamber from before, whereas, Qin Xiyue was staring fixedly at him.

“She utilized an illusion against you?” asked Qin Xiyue when she saw Yang Ye open his eyes.

Yang Ye nodded, and then he laughed bitterly. He’d originally thought that he’d recruited a formidable bodyguard, yet never had he expected that it would actually be a root of trouble, and it was a root of trouble that would cause him to become the public enemy of the southern territory from even the slightest bit of carelessness. He didn’t doubt the woman because the Shang Dynasty had slaughtered the disciples of numerous powers. So, it was reasonable for the woman to say that those powers wouldn’t let her go.

“Where’s she?” Qin Xiyue didn’t ask what the woman had discussed with Yang Ye because she knew her limits.

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment before he said, “She’s with the little fellow!”

There were some things that didn’t have to be concealed from this woman that stood before him. Moreover, even if he did conceal it from her, it would probably be unable to deceive this shrewd woman. He believed that Qin Xiyue had already roughly guessed that he possessed some sort of treasure, and she merely didn’t know the specifics.

Sure enough, a wisp of a smile arose on the corners of Qin Xiyue’s mouth when Yang Ye told her the truth, and then she said, “Then what should we do now?”

“She promised to take us to Emperor Zhou’s true tomb!” Yang Ye smiled, and then he walked over to the coffin and looked at Qin Xiyue as he said, “Come over here!”

Qin Xiyue had just arrived by Yang Ye’s side when the chamber suddenly started trembling. After that, the spot where Yang Ye and Qin Xiyue stood started to descend gradually, and in next to no time, they’d gone underground.

After an unknown period of time, Yang Ye felt that they’d arrived on the ground, and he opened his eyes.

The scene before him caused his eyelids to twitch.

Standing before him was a chamber that was over 10 times larger than the previous chamber. Of course, most importantly, this chamber was made from gold! Yes, the walls in the surroundings and the floor he stood on were all made of gold!

In next to no time, Yang Ye’s gaze shot towards the center at the chamber. Just like the chamber from before, there was a coffin at the center of this chamber. However, unlike the previous chamber, this chamber had 12 statues of guards in golden armor standing around the coffin.

“Is this Emperor Zhou’s coffin?” Yang Ye asked in a low voice as he looked at the coffin.

“It should be!” Qin Xiyue said from the side, “All those years ago, Emperor Zhou had 12 Gold Guards, and these 12 gold statues ought to be his guards from all those years ago. So, the coffin guarded by these 12 Gold Guards should belong to Emperor Zhou.”

“12 Gold Guard?” Yang Ye was puzzled.

Qin Xiyue nodded, and she had a solemn expression as she said, “All of these 12 Gold Guards are experts that had attained the peak of the Exalt Realm, and they could be said to have instilled fear in the Grand Qin and all the various sects. If Emperor Zhou hadn’t desired to eliminate all the sects that stood supreme above the Shang Dynasty’s imperial authority and caused all the powers to join forces against the Shang Dynasty, then with the presence of these 12 Gold Guards, the Shang Dynasty wouldn’t have been annihilated all those years ago!”

“Eliminate the six great powers?” Yang Ye was shocked and said, “Is that even possible?”

“Of course it is!” Qin Xiyue said in a low voice, “All those years ago, Emperor Zhou himself was the number two expert of the southern territory, and he even had the 12 Gold Guards under his command, the assistance of the Grand Preceptor Shengong Mao who was skilled in Theurgy and talismans, and countless troops in his army of Profounders. At that time, even the Darkbeast Empire feared the Shang Dynasty!”

“Who’s the first expert of the southern territory?” asked Yang Ye abruptly. He was rather interested in the peerless experts of the southern territory.

“The Devil Exalt!” A strand of white light flashed as the woman that was originally within Yang Ye’s tiny vortex had appeared, and she said, “At that time, only a single person in the entire southern territory could firmly triumph my imperial father all those years ago, and it was the one who’s said to be the number one expert beneath the skies of the southern territory, the Devil Exalt!”

“The Devil Exalt? The number one expert beneath the skies of the southern territory?” Yang Ye was surprised and revealed an expression of yearning. The number one expert in the entire southern territory!

The woman nodded lightly and said, “He was the publicly acknowledged number one expert of the southern territory!”

When she spoke up to here, the woman suddenly looked at Yang Ye before a wisp of a charming smile appeared on her face. She said, “Don’t be envious. I believe that your accomplishments in the future will definitely not be inferior to my imperial father or the Devil Exalt. I’ll marry you once you become the number one expert of the southern territory, alright?”

Yang Ye returned to his senses when he heard this, and he said with ridicule, “Why aren’t you marrying me now and insist on waiting until I become the number one expert of the southern territory?” Yang Ye felt extreme disdain towards someone that could only enjoy wealth and status yet was unwilling to share hardships and tribulations.

“Would you dare to marry me if I did so now?” The woman smiled spuriously as she gazed at Yang Ye.

Yang Ye was speechless, but he was unwilling to show weakness and said, “If you dare to marry me, then I would dare to marry you!”

He naturally didn’t think that this woman would marry him, and she was probably just joking.

The woman’s eyeballs spun before she said with a smile, “You spoke these words! You better not regret it later! Otherwise, Xuan’er will really look down upon you!”

When he saw her expression, Yang Ye immediately felt that something was slightly off. His instinct told him that this woman was definitely playing some sort of trick. However, he was truly unable to figure out why she said that he would regret it. He immediately said, “I think that it’s you who’ll be regretful!”

Qin Xiyue shook her head to herself. Everything about this little brother is good, and it’s just that he isn’t too smart. She has laid a trap already, yet he still jumps into it.

The woman smiled and didn’t speak any further. She walked slowly towards the coffin. When she arrived before it, the smile on the woman’s face had utterly vanished while traces of fluctuations flashed in her eyes, and she seemed to be recalling the past.

After a long time, she took a deep breath before flicking her finger lightly, and a drop of blood shot towards the center of the forehead of that Gold Guard that stood in the lead.

As soon as the pearl of blood entered the center of its forehead, the tightly shut eyes of the statue suddenly opened, and then it knelt before the woman under the astounded gazes of Yang Ye and Qin Xiyue. At the same time, the 11 gold statues behind it slowly knelt down as well.

“This is....” Yang Ye gulped while his eyes were filled with disbelief. Earlier, Qin Xiyue had said that these 12 Gold Guards were peak Exalt Realm expert, and he felt that it would be extremely terrifying if these 12 Gold Guards were alive!

“This is the Puppeteering Technique!” Qin Xiyue who was similarly shocked had returned to her senses, and she spoke in a low voice. “They aren’t alive, and they’re probably a product of the Mechanical Puppeteering Technique that was renowned through the southern territory at that time!

The woman turned around to glance at Qin Xiyue with slight surprise, and then she said, “Nice knowledge. I never expected that you would even know about the Mechanical Puppeteering Technique that has been lost for hundreds of years. Your identity isn’t simple!”

Qin Xiyue remained silent.

Yang Ye asked. “Mechanical Puppeteering? In other words, these puppets aren’t the real Gold Guards, and they are just puppets?”

The woman glanced at Qin Xiyue before she shook her head and said, “These aren’t ordinary puppets. Every single one of them was created with treasures of the heavens and the earth, and all of these puppets possess a strand of the soul of the 12 Gold Guards. Besides that, the Grand Preceptor even utilized a supreme secret technique to preserve their perception in combat from when they were still alive and sealed it within these puppets. Even though they aren’t at the Exalt Real right now, their strengths can’t be underestimated. Simply speaking, every single one of them is equivalent to a Spirit Realm Profounder!”
