Chapter 1174 – Do All Of You Want To Die?

The expressions of the others behind Yang Ye had turned unsightly when they heard her!

She’s going too far!

All of them were livid. Even Nan Shuang’s face was cold, and her hands were clenched tightly. She seemed like she was on the verge of being unable to restrain herself from attacking.

It wasn’t just Nan Shuang who was in such a state. Many other cultivators here were almost unable to stop themselves from attack. All of them were experts who lived dangerous lives, so they didn’t lack courage at all.

How could they remain indifferent when someone insulted them like that? However, reason told them that they couldn’t attack. Because the woman had 5 more Quasi Emperors on her side, and all of them were from the Dark Sky Sect!

If they attacked, they would die!

Yang Ye gazed at her for a short while, and then he said, “We’re just people who live from day to day, and we can’t compare to the Dark Sky Sect. So, please show some mercy!”

The woman shrugged and said, “I gave all of you a chance. Just crawl through from beneath me, and....”

Her voice stopped abruptly because Yang Ye had suddenly swung his fist. However, she wasn’t nervous at all when he did that, and there was even a wisp of ridicule on the corners of her mouth.

Right when Yang Ye’s fist had arrived before her, a blue barrier suddenly appeared in front of her and obstructed Yang Ye’s fist.

Bang!

The barrier shook violently while Yang Ye took 2 steps back, but she remained motionless on the spot.

She laughed with ridicule and pointed at the blue pendant on her chest, “This is a Quasi Emperor Rank treasure, Sea of Protection. Even a Quasi Emperor....”

“Sword!” Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly stretched out his hand and gestured. Lin Xing’s sword suddenly let out a sword howl, struggled free of Lin Xing’s grasp, and transformed into a ray of light that shot into Yang Ye’s grasp. A moment later, Yang Ye appeared right before the woman, and the sword in his grasp stabbed swiftly against the barrier before her.

Crack!

A clear and resounding crack resounded, and then the blue barrier started cracking. Her expression changed drastically at the sight of it, and she was just about to retreat when Yang Ye exerted slight force with his right hand.

Bang!

The barrier shattered immediately, and shock arose in the woman’s eyes. She was just about to flee when Yang Ye pressed forward and slammed his fist against her stomach.

“Pu!” Blood sprayed from her mouth as her figure in a ‘C’ as it flew backwards. Suddenly, Yang Ye appeared in front of her again, and then he grabbed her hair in midair before dragging her down to the ground. Once he arrived at the ground, Yang Ye slammed her against the ground!

Bang!

The ground collapsed while blood sprayed towards the surroundings!

“How dare you!” The experts of the Dark Sky Sect were infuriated when they recovered from their shock, and they charged at Yang Ye.

Suddenly, Yang Ye stomped his foot down against the woman’s head, and then he looked up at the experts of the Dark Sky Sect, “Take another step forward and I’ll crush her head!”

“Don’t you dare!” One of the old men shouted furiously, “Do you realize that she’s....”

Suddenly, the old man’s voice stopped abruptly because Yang Ye had started to exert force with his leg, and the woman’s head immediately sunk into the ground. Yang Ye looked up at the old man while a slight smile curled up on the corners of his mouth, “Do you want to try me?”

“You....” The old man’s face was absolutely ferocious, but he didn’t dare speak another word. He was very afraid of infuriating Yang Ye and causing the woman’s head to explode.

Yang Ye withdrew his gaze and looked down at the woman beneath his feet, “What did you have to do this? I was speaking nicely to you, yet you refused to listen. Now, it’s awkward for everyone!”

As he spoke, Yang Ye waved his right hand, and the blue pendant on her chest and her spatial ring immediately flew into his grasp.

Yang Ye swept through its contents and couldn’t help but pucker his lips at its contents. Her identity wasn’t ordinary, but he felt that she was quite poor. She only had a little over 300 violet crystals. As for miscellaneous items, she had quite a bit of them including treasures and techniques. However, most of them were just at the Divine Rank.

Yang Ye shook his head and flicked the spatial ring over to Nan Shuang, “That’s for you!”

Nan Shuang glanced at its contents, and then her breathing immediately quickened. A few hundred violet crystals! It would take me so many years to accumulate!

Her hands were trembling slightly!

After he tossed the spatial ring to her, his gaze descended onto the blue pendant in his grasp and nodded slightly. It really was at the Quasi Emperor Rank, but it was useless to him. Because it wasn’t even as strong as his body. Yang Ye flicked it over to Nan Shuang as well, “It’s yours!”

The others here couldn’t help but be visibly moved. That pendant is a Quasi Emperor Rank treasure! Yet he gave it away just like that!

Nan Shuang was quite stunned as well. She hadn’t expected Yang Ye to even give her a Quasi Emperor Rank treasure. After all, it could be sold for 10,000 violet crystals at the very least!

But he’d given 10,000 violet crystals to her just like that!

Nan Shuang was dumbstruck as she gazed at the pendant on her palm.

Meanwhile, there was envy in Gu Lan and the others’ eyes as they glanced at Yang Ye and Nan Shuang. After all, based on the woman in a blue dress’ identity, the spatial ring definitely had quite a few treasures in it. Moreover, that wasn’t even the end of it. That blue pendant was a Quasi Emperor Rank treasure! But Yang Ye had casually given it to Nan Shuang. But while they felt envious, they felt even more joy. They were happy for Nan Shuang.

Yang Ye looked up one of the white robe old men and said, “Do you want to keep her alive?”

The white robed old man stared fixedly at Yang Ye, “You’ll die!”

“AH!!!” Meanwhile, the woman beneath Yang Ye’s foot let out a shrill and miserable cry, and her head had sunken fully beneath the surface.

“How dare you!” The white robed old man was furious, and he was about to attack. But Yang Ye suddenly said, “Come on! Let’s see if you arrive first or her head explodes first!”

The white robed old man took a deep breath and worked hard to make himself calm down. After that, he gazed at Yang Ye and said, “What do you want?”

“5,000 violet crystals. Give me 5,000 violet crystals and I’ll release her!” Yang Ye looked the old man in the eyes and said, “Don’t try to bargain with me, and don’t start talking nonsense. I don’t have any patience. If you think I wouldn’t dare to kill her, then you can give me a try!”

The white robed old man stared at Yang Ye in silence.

Yang Ye was looking at the old man as well, but he started to exerted force with his foot.

Meanwhile, the woman’s weak voice arose from beneath Yang Ye’s foot, “Give... give it to him....”

Yang Ye looked down at her and smiled, “How sensible!” As he spoke, he gazed at the old man and stretched out his hand.

Meanwhile, Ye Liuyun suddenly walked over to Yang Ye’s side and spoke softly, “We can threaten her and leave safely!”

Yang Ye glanced at Ye Liuyun, and then he gazed at the white robed old man.

Ye Liuyun’s pupils constricted slightly, and she gained a slight understanding of Yang Ye’s true motives. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

The old man glanced at Yang Ye, and then he turned around to look at the other 4 old men. They hesitated before withdrawing a spatial ring each. But it seemed to still be insufficient, so they asked the other disciples of the Dark Sky Sect to gather their violet crystals as well. In the end, the white robed old man walked over to Yang Ye while holding a spatial ring in his hand.

The old man said, “Let her go first!”

Yang Ye replied, “Do you have the right to bargain with me?”

The old man gazed at Yang Ye for a long time before he flicked the spatial ring over to Yang Ye. Yang Ye glanced at its contents before taking it in his grasp. After that, he removed his foot and moved aside, “See, I really keep my promises!”

Just as Ye Liuyun had said, they could leave by threatening her. However, he wouldn’t do that. Why? Because everyone was selfish. If he threatened the woman and led them away, they would merely thank him at most, and some might not even thank him. After they leave, they would flee immediately.

After that, he, Yang Ye, and the Sword Alliance would have to face the Dark Sky Sect’s revenge!

At that time, they wouldn’t come and help, they would just flee as far as they could.

Simply speaking, they were merely following him with the intention of using him. Yang Ye was no fool. He felt that they could all live, but they had to bear the trouble that came with it as well!

The white robed old man’s figure flashed and hurriedly grabbed the woman from the ground. At this moment, everyone was able to see her appearance clearly. Her features had warped and were stained with blood. When compared to before, her appearance was simply worlds apart, and it was quite terrifying as well.

The woman’s gaze descended onto Yang Ye, and it was filled with resentment. Meanwhile, Yang Ye ignored her and turned around to look at Nan Shuang, “Don’t fight later. Just follow me, understand?”

Nan Shuang blinked, and she didn’t really understand why Yang Ye said that. Suddenly, the woman in a blue dress gazed at Nan Shuang and spoke ferociously, “Bitch! I’ll make living worse than death for you! Besides that woman, kill everyone else here! Kill them all! Don’t let even a single one of them live!”

The white robed old man’s face fell when he heard her. She was brainless, but he wasn’t, of course. Under such circumstances, it was best for the Dark Sky Sect to take a step back for now and let them go, and then get even with them later. Because while all the people here were lousy mercenaries and independent cultivators, the combined strength of the experts here surpassed the combined strength of their forces!

But he knew that he couldn’t dissuade her because she wasn’t in her right mind right now.

The 5 old men at the Quasi Emperor Realm were slightly hesitant, but the experts behind them didn’t dare to disobey her orders. So, they immediately charged at Yang Ye and the others.

Yang Ye turned around to gaze at the group behind him, “Do all of you want to die?”

They immediately replied, “No!”

Yang Ye nodded and said, “If you don’t want to die, then follow me and kill our way out!”

As he spoke, Yang Ye turned around and shot forward explosively. He’d charged at the experts from the Dark Sky Sect.
