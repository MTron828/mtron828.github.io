Chapter 1628 -The Rebirth Fruit!

Translator: InVader

He refuses to tell me? Yang Ye was quite stunned by this.

Yang Ye was about to speak when the Grand Elder spoke abruptly, “The owner of that sword had quite a special identity. Since you’ve inherited his sword, you’ll have to inherit his responsibility. As for what that responsibility is, you don’t need to know right now. You’ll naturally find out once you’ve truly gained that sword’s acknowledgment.”

Nothing in this world was free.

Yang Ye naturally understood that. So, he pondered deeply for a moment and said, “Is taking this sword a good thing or a bad thing for me?”

“It’s good and bad!” The Grand Elder explained, “Once you obtain its acknowledgement, you’ll obtain the acknowledgment of a mysterious power. However, it’s a bad thing too. Because you’ll inherit some responsibilities.” He paused for a moment and continued, “The last owner of this sword is dead. He died for that responsibility!”

Yang Ye asked, “Was the last owner strong?”

The Grand Elder nodded, “Very strong. An existence that surpasses the Zenith Realm.”

Yang Ye felt speechless.

The Grand Elder asked, “Do you still want it?”

Yang Ye replied, “Your Wu Clan knew that this sword was within it, but you didn’t take it. Is it because you’re afraid?”

The Grand Elder shook his head, “Countless disciples of my Wu Clan want it. However, you should be very well aware that it’s not always the person that chooses the sword, and it’s the sword that chooses a person. That sword has chosen you.”

Yang Ye nodded, “I understand.”

The Grand Elder asked, “So, do you want it?”

“Of course!” Yang Ye smiled, “Of course I do. I do believe in fate and destiny on many occasions. Since I met it, and it chose me, then I believe it’s fate. Of course, most importantly, it’s able to improve my combat strength.”

What did Yang Ye need the most right now?

Strength!

Along with the improvement in his Laws of Darkness and the merge between his sword intent and slaughter intent, while he could kill Zenith Realm experts now, it was far from sufficient to face the Yang Clan. He had to grow even stronger!

The Grand Elder gazed at Yang Ye for a long time and said, “You’re not a subordinate of Yang Yan. If I’m not wrong, you’re one of the young masters of the Yang Clan, right?”

Yang Ye nodded and smiled, “You wouldn’t expose me, right?”

The Grand Elder shook his head, “I won’t interfere in your Yang Clan’s business.” He paused for a moment and continued, “What is she to you?”

Yang Ye replied, “My wife!” He would naturally not say that An Nanjing was a friend. The Wu Clan attached great importance to her, and it was obvious that the entire Wu Clan would do all it could to foster her. As far as these clans were concerned, it was best to foster one of their own.

Wasn’t it simple to make someone become one of their own? The simplest method was to make An Nanjing marry into the Wu Clan.

Yang Ye could sense that the old man standing before him had such thoughts. So, he had to put an end to them. He didn’t want something absurd like being forced to stop a marriage from happening again.

The Grand Elder glanced at Yang Ye and nodded, “Understood. How about I do this? Once the patriarch emerges from the patriarch’s closed door cultivation, I’ll tell the patriarch to adopt her. Is that alright?”

Yang Ye quickly asked, “Is your patriarch strong?”

The Grand Elder spoke indifferently, “One of the strongest in the medium universe of Milky Way System.”

One of the strongest! Yang Ye hurriedly replied, “Of course it’s not a problem.”

If An Nanjing had such powerful backing, then she would be able to move unhindered through the medium universe of Milky Way System!

The Grand Elder added, “The fight for succession in your Yang Clan is about to begin. However, both of you are still too weak. So, I hope she can stay in my Wu Clan for now. If she wants to help you when the time comes, my Wu Clan will absolutely not stop her.”

Yang Ye glanced at the Grand Elder, “Old Man, it suddenly feels like your Wu Clan is really understanding and reasonable.”

The Grand Elder smiled, “It’s a good thing for you, right?”

He flicked a black fruit over to Yang Ye as he spoke, “The Rebirth Fruit. It should be helpful to you.”

Yang Ye didn’t take it and asked instead, “Why?”

The Wu Clan’s attitude towards him had suddenly become so favorable. It wasn’t just being understanding and reasonable, they even gave him a Rebirth Fruit. It was slightly unusual.

The Grand Elder smiled, “It’s a display of goodwill from my Wu Clan. As for the reason, why make a fuss about that. Right?”

Yang Ye fell silent for an instant, and then he said, “Can I get two more?”

The Grand Elder glanced at Yang Ye and smiled, “Of course!” He flicked two more fruits to Yang Ye.

Yang Ye took all three fruits, and then he cupped his fist to the Grand Elder, “Thank you.”

The Grand Elder nodded and said, “Charge into the Rebirth Realm in my Wu Clan. It’s safer.”

Yang Ye cupped his fist again, “Thank you.”

The Rebirth Realm wasn’t like the Dualism Realm. It required one to send one’s mind and soul into the world of reincarnation. The main body would be in extreme danger under such circumstances. Now that the Wu Clan was willing to provide him with a place to advance, it was naturally an extremely good thing for him.

The Grand Elder turned to look at the man in a luxurious robe from before, “Wu Ming, take him to the Training Hall. Don’t let anyone disturb him!”

The man called Wu Ming nodded and gazed at Yang Ye, “Please come with me!”

Yang Ye nodded slightly, and then he turned around and vanished into the distance with Wu Ming.

Once Yang Ye left, an old man behind the Grand Elder asked, “Grand Elder, why were you so nice to him?”

The Grand Elder gazed towards the direction Yang Ye had left towards, and he just gazed at it for a long time before he said, “Do you know what our ancestor told me before he left? Our ancestor told me to draw him over to our side.” Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

The Grand Elder took a deep breath and continued, “I’m sure you’re aware how difficult it is to make our ancestor think highly of someone. All the geniuses of our Wu Clan and even Wu Ming’s who’s half a step away from the Zenith Realm weren’t satisfactory to him. However, he thinks highly of that young master of the Yang Clan who’s only at the Dualism Realm!”

The old man behind the Grand Elder spoke solemnly, “Why? I didn’t notice anything extraordinary about him.”

“He isn’t just extraordinary!” The Grand Elder continued, “Actually, even if our ancestor didn’t say anything, I would have tried to draw him over to our side. How could someone capable of obtaining that divine sword’s acknowledgement be ordinary? Go investigate which young master of the Yang Clan is a sword cultivator. Besides that, give my order that the disciples of our Wu Clan are prohibited from participating in the Yang Clan’s fight for succession. As for those who’ve chosen sides, tell them to get back here immediately.”

The old man nodded, and then he turned around and left.

The Grand Elder looked off into the distance and spoke softly, “The Yang Clan’s fight for succession is getting quite interesting this time…”

…

Yang Ye didn’t go straight to the Training Hall. He asked Wu Ming to lead him to Lu Lige instead.

Lu Lige asked when he saw Yang Ye, “Are you alright?”

Yang Ye shook his head, and then he flicked a Rebirth Fruit to Lu Lige, “This is yours.”

Lu Lige was slightly stunned, and then he flicked it back to Yang Ye, “The Wu Clan gave it to you…”

Yang Ye shook his head, “The Wu Clan gave me three.”

Lu Lige was astounded, “They’re being that nice to you?”

Yang Ye shrugged, “Anyway, are you going to leave or go with me to the Wu Clan and attempt to advance into the Rebirth Realm?”

Lu Lige thought for a moment and replied, “I have to head home and make some preparations before I do that.”

Yang Ye nodded, “Alright. Farewell then.”

“Right.” Lu Lige suddenly said, “I don’t know your name yet.”

“Yang Ye!” Yang Ye turned around and walked away once he finished speaking.

“Yang Ye?” Lu Lige was slightly stunned and said, “Why have I never heard that name?”

“Just wait! It won’t be long before my name spreads throughout Milky Way System!” Yang Ye’s voice came from afar.

…

Wu Ming led Yang Ye into the Martial Dimension. Actually, the Martial Dimension wasn’t very huge, and it was around the same size as Martial Origin City. Even though it wasn’t huge, it was the place filled with the most experts throughout Martial Origin System, and it was the safest place in Martial Origin System.

It was where the Wu Clan’s disciples resided, and it was the center of the Wu Clan. So, if Yang Ye advanced into the Rebirth Realm here, he could be considered to be absolutely safe unless three or more of the eight clans joined forces and attacked. However, it was clearly impossible.

The Training Hall.

Wu Ming brought Yang Ye to a pavilion, and then he said, “No one will disturb you during this period. Right, the Grand Elder asked me to remind you that the Yang Clan’s fight for succession is starting in a month. Charging into the Rebirth Realm…”

Yang Ye nodded, “It’s fine. I’ll make it.”

Wu Ming’s eyelids twitched, “Do you know how long it took me to advance into the Rebirth Realm?”

Yang Ye shook his head.

“Three years!” Wu Ming continued, “An entire three years! Moreover, I failed in the end. If it wasn’t for our Grand Elder, I would be dead. What I’m trying to say is that the Rebirth Realm isn’t that simple. So, it’s best if you think it through.”

Yang Ye nodded, “Thank you for the reminder.”

Wu Ming nodded slightly, “Don’t worry. Even if you fail, you won’t be trapped within it. The Grand Elder will help. Alright, good luck!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he turned around and left.

Once Wu Ming left, Yang Ye entered the pavilion. As soon as he passed through the doorway, the scene before his eyes changed. It didn’t take long for him to arrive in an empty space.

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings, sat down cross-legged, and then he vanished on the spot.

Even though he had quite a good impression of the Wu Clan, he still took preventative measures. It was those Blood Puppets. During this period that he would be cultivating within the Primordial Pagoda, the Blood Puppets would immediately defend him if someone tried to attack him.

One always had to take precautions against others!

In the 3rd level of the Primordial Pagoda.

Yang Ye sat cross-legged on the ground, and he held the Rebirth Fruit. He gazed at it for a long time, and then he took a deep breath, “Rebirth… Little Sky, wait for me! Yang Yan, Yang Danqing… Both of you wait too…”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye swallowed the Rebirth Fruit.
