Chapter 1850 – It’s With Yang Ye!

The sword!

Yang Ye knew that the middle aged man was definitely speaking about the wooden sword. The middle aged man knew who he was!

Snowy blinked. She glanced at the middle aged man, and then glanced at Yang Ye. At this moment, even she felt something was off. She flew over to Yang Ye’s shoulder, but she couldn’t help but glance at the fruit from time to time.

Meanwhile, the middle aged man gazed at Yang Ye and smiled, “What do you think?”

Yang Ye asked, “Who are you?”

The middle aged man replied, “Is that important?”

Yang Ye answered, “Indeed, it isn’t. However, I’m sorry. I don’t want to make that exchange.”

The middle aged man smiled, “Then forget it!” He put the True Spirit Fruit away and walked away.

It didn’t take long for everyone here to watch the middle aged man leave the hall. Right after he left the hall, some others left as well.

“A fight is going to break out!” Dark spoke abruptly from Yang Ye’s side, “Want to go watch?”

Yang Ye nodded.

They immediately vanished from the hall.

Boom!

They’d just left the hall when an explosion resounded in the distance. After that, the entire ground started to tremble violently.

Yang Ye and Dark exchanged glances, “As expected, some couldn’t endure such temptation and have started acting against him. Unfortunately, they’re mostly going to give their lives away.”

Yang Ye asked, “Why?”

Dark explained, “Since he dared to show it in public and without concealing his identity, he’s definitely confident in his strength. Such a person is definitely not easy to deal with.”

Yang Ye looked towards the distance, and he saw all sorts of powerful energy flickering incessantly. Yang Ye watched for a while before he withdrew his gaze, and then he looked at Dark, “Why was he able to recognize me?”

Dark replied, “There’s no need to be so surprised. There are countless capable people here. So, finding you isn’t that difficult for some people. For example, besides the three Ancient Cultivators and the four Heavenly Exalts, my Heaven’s Net can find anyone you want within a day!”

Yang Ye was about to speak when the battle calmed down.

Dark said, “It’s over!”

Meanwhile, the middle aged man suddenly appeared before Yang Ye and Dark. He sized up Dark and smiled, “I didn’t expect the leader of Heaven’s Net to actually form an alliance with someone who’d merely at the 2nd stage of the True Realm.”

Dark replied, “If I’m not wrong, you should be one of the five Emperors, the Ancient Emperor, right?”

The middle aged man smiled, “As expected of the leader of Heaven’s Net. Besides the four Heavenly Exalts and three Ancient Cultivators, no one else can escape your detection!”

Yang Ye gazed at Dark, “The five Emperors?”

Dark explained, “The five Emperors are below the three Ancient Cultivators and four Heavenly Exalts. The Night Emperor is one of them. As for the man before us, he’s Gu Xuancang, the Ancient Emperor.”

The middle aged man chuckled, “Emperors? It’s just an undeserved title.” He gazed at Yang Ye, “Are you really not going to do it? Even though this fruit isn’t as precious as that sword of yours, it should be extremely helpful to you.”

Yang Ye shook his head. The wooden sword was much more useful to him. Moreover, Snowy would definitely not agree to exchange it for the fruit.

A wisp of regret flashed through Gu Xuancang’s eyes, “As expected, I failed.”

Yang Ye glanced at him and said, “You can take it by force or expose my location!”

“How would that benefit me?” Gu Xuancang continued, “If I take it by force, maybe I’ll be able to defeat you, but I won’t be able to kill you. At that time, I might be able to get it, but the world will know that it’s in my possession. I too don’t want to be targeted by countless people. Moreover, if I fail, I’ll have another enemy. That isn’t worth it! I refuse to do business that ends in my loss!”

Yang Ye couldn’t help but smile when he heard this. He felt the Ancient Emperor was quite interesting.

Meanwhile, the Ancient Emperor gazed at Yang Ye, “I heard that there’s enmity between you and the Night Emperor!”

Yang Ye nodded, “Irreconcilable enmity!”

The Ancient Emperor shook his head slightly, “It’s best if you don’t think about revenge for the next 50 years.”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Why?”

The Ancient Emperor replied, “He has backing. As for who’s backing him, I can’t say. Moreover, he has quite a good relationship with two other Emperors. In any case, it’s best if you get more help if you try to kill him!”

Yang Ye glanced at the Ancient Emperor, and the latter said, “Don’t even think about it. Even though I’m not afraid of him, I’m not stupid enough to become enemies with him. After all, there’s no connection between us, right?”

Yang Ye shrugged and didn’t say another word.

Suddenly, they looked up at the sky. There was a blue passageway at the end of their vision, and it was trembling.

The Ancient Emperor said, “Another one is coming down to give his or her life away!”

Yang Ye was speechless.

It didn’t take long for a figure to emerge from the blue passageway. This person wore silver armor, and he held a silver spear in his right grasp.

The Ancient Emperor frowned slightly at the sight of the man, “He’s not ordinary.”

Yang Ye nodded. The armored man had descended from the large universe, so he’d clearly exhausted a huge amount of strength. Because his countenance was extremely pale. Moreover, his armor was covered in cracks.

Suddenly, numerous auras appeared around him. However, a voice resounded abruptly, “This person must not be touched!”

The voice was very calm, but it contained a deterring force that made others’ hearts tremble!

The Ancient Emperor’s frown grew deeper when he heard this.

Yang Ye asked, “What is it?”

The Ancient Emperor spoke solemnly, “That was a Heavenly Exalt’s voice! Who is he? He actually made a Heavenly Exalt speak on his behalf!”

Yang Ye looked up at the armored man. Meanwhile, the man glanced at the surroundings and said, “I’m under the Sovereign of Man’s orders to search for a sword here in the lower universe. Many years ago, it descended with a head. Contact me if you know where it is.” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Meanwhile, a voice suddenly resounded, “Will we get anything for doing that?”

The armored man glanced at the source of the voice and replied, “You can get a high-grade Imperial Rank treasure!”

Suddenly, the surroundings fell silent, but it only took a moment for countless voices to resound, “It’s with Yang Ye!”

Yang Ye felt speechless.

The armored man frowned, “Who’s Yang Ye?”

Meanwhile, a black clothed figure appeared before the armored man and said, “He’s a sword cultivator of our universe. The sword you spoke of is in his possession.”

The armored man asked, “How’s his character?”

The black clothed man replied, “Terrible. He’s ruthless, extremely decisive, and cruel. Right, he has comprehended slaughter intent, and it’s at the Enlightened Rank!”

Yang Ye felt absolutely speechless.

The armored man’s expression became icy cold, “Enlightened Rank slaughter intent! Dammit! It has actually fallen into the hands of such a person! Dammit!” He gazed at the black clothed man, “Where is he right now?”

The black clothed man shook his head, “I don’t know! However, he should be in Heaven Pillar Mountain because he wants to go up to the large universe too.”

The man moved his right hand, and a ray of light flickered over to the black clothed man. Everyone here hadn’t even been able to see it clearly before the black clothed man had put it away and vanished on the spot.

Meanwhile, the armored man glanced at the surroundings and said, “I’ll be here. Contact me if you know where Yang Ye is. Anyone who provides information about Yang Ye’s whereabouts will get a high-grade Imperial Rank treasure?”

Suddenly, a voice resounded, “Are you serious?”

The armored man replied, “Of course!”

It didn’t take long for the surroundings to calm down. All the people hiding in the shadows had clearly left. As for the reason, they had naturally gone to find Yang Ye.

The Ancient Emperor and Dark simultaneously gazed at Yang Ye, “Yang Ye didn’t say anything, but his profound energy started surging.

Dark said, “It’s quite tempting!”

The Ancient Emperor nodded and spoke with agreement, “Extremely tempting. Moreover, it’s right within reach!”

Yang Ye remained silent.

Suddenly, the Ancient Emperor chuckled and left.

Yang Ye was slightly stunned and asked, “Why?”

The Ancient Emperor stopped, “Even though it’s a good treasure, treasures are just objects while people are alive. If it’s between a treasure and a friend, I choose the latter. There’s one other reason. I’ve investigated you, Kid. Actually, you’re not a wicked person. The reason you’re in so much trouble is mostly because of others’ greed. Moreover, the thing I admire about you the most is that you always stand by your principles, and you’re a loyal person with a temper.”

He paused for a moment and continued, “Instead of another enemy, I prefer to have another friend in this damnable place!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he vanished on the spot.

Yang Ye fell silent for a short while, and then he gazed at Dark. The latter said, “He’s right. It’s best to have more friends in this damnable place. Do you know why I didn’t choose the Night Emperor and chose you instead?”

Yang Ye shook his head.

Dark explained, “Because I can’t become friends with the Night Emperor. He’s adept at scheming, and he can stop at nothing to accomplish some things; but you won’t do that! You’re a principled person, and your heart is pure. Of course, there’s another reason, and it’s your potential. I firmly believe that so long as you don’t die, then it won’t be long before no one in this world will be able to stop you!”

He suddenly frowned when he spoke up to this point.

Yang Ye asked, “What is it?”

Dark gazed at Yang Ye, “Many people have gone to my Heaven’s Net and requested that we find you! There’s even an influential figure amongst them!”

Yang Ye was stunned speechless.
