Chapter 1273 – Come At Me!

Yang Ye laid on the ground. As he gazed at the sky and sensed the injuries throughout his body, he couldn’t help but sigh with emotion, “I almost died!”

While he’d won this time, it was a miserable victory. His profound energy had dried up, and his body was heavily injured internally. Especially the 2 arrows on his chest. They’d pierced through his lungs. Just breathing a little made him feel like his entire body was being cut apart. Besides that, because he’d fought for too long and too madly, his body was exhausted beyond its limits. At this moment....

In short, he’d truly been reduced to a miserable state! Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

He hadn’t used his profound energy to repair his injuries earlier. Why? He didn’t dare to! Under such circumstances, he wouldn’t even be able to escape if he used all his profound energy to heal himself. Moreover, that little bit of profound energy he had was utterly insufficient to repair his injuries. If he used it to repair his injuries, the outcome would be that he wouldn’t be able to escape while his injuries weren’t healed as well!

Heal!

I have to heal!

Yang Ye withdrew a pile of violet crystals. He swallowed some while igniting the others, and he just started absorbing the energy coming from them.

Spirit energy surged incessantly into Yang Ye’s body before being completely absorbed by the tiny vortex. It didn’t take long for threads of Primordial Violet Energy to flow out from within the tiny vortex. In the end, it moved along his meridians and spread throughout his body to repair his injuries. Once the violet energy appeared within him, the injuries he’d suffered started to heal swiftly.

Yang Ye closed his eyes and just allowed the violet energy to repair his body.

Would the Veiled Region let the matter rest? Yang Ye had asked himself that question, and the answer was definitely no. They’d sent 3 Voiders to kill him from the very beginning, and it proved that they really intended to annihilate him. Now that they’d witnessed his true strength and natural talent, they would definitely stop at nothing to kill him. No one would allow someone with extraordinary potential to continue living, even he wouldn’t!

After experiencing the previous battle, they would definitely not look down upon him at all. So, he was in trouble now. Because it was absolutely obvious that they would send even more experts or even stronger experts to kill him.

That wasn’t even the biggest problem he had; the biggest problem was that they could find him!

He didn’t know how they found him so accurately, but he was very well aware that he would never be able to gain the initiative over them if this continued!

Even utilizing the Sword Domain to conceal his aura was useless.

How are they locating me? Yang Ye’s brows were pressed tightly together. Now, he only had 2 choices. The 1st was to kill that mysterious woman who was pursuing him, and the 2nd was to find a way to conceal his aura.

Kill her? It’s obviously impossible. At the very least, I can’t accomplish it right now. Because she has 2 Voiders by her side. If I go back now, it would be like walking straight into a trap. Conceal my aura? Even the Sword Domain didn’t make a difference! Wait! She’s definitely unable to see through my Sword Domain! In other words, she has definitely been utilizing some sort of special method to lock onto me, and she isn’t using my aura to do so!

But what is that method?

Yang Ye’s brows were knit tightly together as he recalled the scenes during the battle with the mysterious woman. He pondered deeply for a long time before he suddenly opened his eyes, “Space!”

Space!

He hadn’t even been able to catch sight of her throughout the battle. It was like she’d fused into one with space, truly fused into one with space. In other words, her attainments in space were definitely extremely great. That wasn’t the main point, the main point was that regardless of whether he moved or did something, he would leave traces behind in space.

The Sword Domain could conceal his aura, but he would definitely leave fluctuations behind at the space he’d passed through, and with her attainments in space, it was very likely for her to rely on those fluctuations to find him!

Yang Ye slowly closed his eyes. He gazed at the sky in silence for a moment, and then he stood up. If she could really rely on space to locate him, then it meant that his position was exposed from the very beginning. His current strength was inferior, and she was hidden while he was out in the open. So, he was in a very bad situation!

Yang Ye remained silent on the spot.

In the Sword Domain, everything is within my control.... Space.... Suddenly, a thought appeared in his mind, and then a trace of excitement gradually appeared in his eyes. He took a step forward, and then the space in an area of 3km was instantly enveloped by his Sword Domain. As soon as the Sword Domain covered the area, he could clearly sense everything within the area. Even a tiny ant or a microorganism that was smaller than an ant had appeared clearly before him!

This time, he didn’t try to sense all of them, and he sensed the space around him instead!

Space was something abstract, but if one sensed it seriously, that abstract concept would become three-dimensional. Space was something without energy, and it was something that was very difficult to describe precisely with words. It did exist just like sword intent, but it needed to affect something in order to prove its existence. Of course, once one attained a certain level of strength, there was no need to use anything to prove that it existed.

He could execute the Void Flash technique to travel through space, but he was merely a passing traveler through space, and he hadn’t fused into one with it!

What he intended to do right now was to try and fuse into one with space!

Because only by accomplishing that could he avoid leaving any traces behind in space. Otherwise, even the Sword Domain couldn’t keep him hidden!

Yang Ye was a Quasi Emperor, so he had a certain level of attainments in space. Coupled with the fact that he’d learned the Void Flash technique and could travel freely through space, and he possessed the Sword Domain to control space, it wasn’t that difficult for him to fuse into one with space. However, it still wasn’t that easy.

He’d made another discovery as well, and he couldn’t help but curse himself after making it. Actually, he could have located that mysterious woman during the battle. Because so long as he activated the Sword Domain, she wouldn’t be able to escape his detection while she remained within its scope. But he hadn’t done so. However, it wasn’t his fault. Because at this point, he’d practically forgotten that it existed.

Because he truly had very few chances to utilize it!

Now, the important matter at hand was to recover his profound energy and heal before comprehending the secrets of space, and then finally refine the corpses of Voiders into Sword Servants!

He wanted to refine those Voiders into Sword Servants, but it would take at least 10 to 15 days. But what did he lack the most right now?

Time!

He needed time!

Yang Ye studied the secrets of space as he recovered his profound energy. Just like that, around an hour passed before his expression suddenly changed, and then he waved his sword lightly before transforming into a ray of light that entered the space before him.

Not long after Yang Ye left, the old man and middle aged man appeared where he’d been standing.

“He has recovered by at least 30 to 40%!” It wasn’t the old man or the middle aged man, and it was the mysterious woman who’d spoken these words. Even though her voice was resounding through here, she wasn’t here at all. Regardless of whether it was the old man or middle aged man, they couldn’t sense her location, and that was why they feared her.

The old man in a luxurious robe frowned, and there was a questioning tone in his voice, “He suffered such heavy injuries. Can he even recover by 30 to 40% in such a short period?”

“It might not be 30 to 40%, and it might be 50 to 60% instead!” The mysterious woman spoke solemnly, “The most terrifying part about him isn’t his attainments in the sword, it’s his recovery. I suspect that he might possess the Undying Physique of legend. If that’s true, then we must kill him with a single strike. Otherwise, he’ll exhaust us to death!”

“The 3 of us are probably unable to kill him within an instant!” The middle aged man with the bow on his back spoke indifferently, “His body is at the Epoch Realm, so it’s comparable to a Voider Realm demon beast. Moreover, he possesses that precious treasure of the Yuan Clan’s, the Phantom Shield. Under the circumstances that he possesses profound energy, our joint forces are incapable of killing him in a short period of time. Moreover, you’re heavily injured right now and don’t possess sufficient combat strength. So, it’ll be even more difficult for us to kill him. Thus, our objective right now shouldn’t be to kill him; it should be to delay him and try our best to devoid him of time to recover his profound energy and heal!”

The old man nodded and spoke with agreement, “That’s true!”

Meanwhile, the woman suddenly asked, “How many has the Veiled Region sent? When will they be here?”

The old man spoke in a low voice, “I didn’t ask how many, but it’s Old Man Yuan of the Yuan Clan that’s leading the group.”

The middle aged man’s eyelids twitched, “Old Man Yuan?”

The old man nodded, “Actually, just he alone is enough. But he still brought others with him. Obviously, even he was shocked by how terrifying Yang Ye is and doesn’t dare to underestimate Yang Ye!”

The middle aged man said, “With him, the people he brought, the expert from the Slayer Pavilion, and us here, if we’re still unable to kill Yang Ye, then he isn’t just comparable to Jian Wuji, even Jian Wuji is inferior to him.”

The old man nodded slightly, and then he glanced at the surroundings, “Let’s go. We can’t give him too much time to breathe. His injuries haven’t healed, so you just have to lead the way. In any case, he won’t be able to do anything to you while you stay hidden!”

“Let’s go!” As soon as she spoke, she instantly vanished on the spot. But she revealed a trace of her aura so that the middle aged man and old man could immediately catch up to her.

Over 100,000km away, Yang Ye emerged from an area in space. However, he immediately transformed into a ray of light that shot once more into space. Just like that, he executed Void Flash thrice in succession before finally stopping.

Once he stopped, he quickly withdrew violet crystals and swallowed them. He was just about to continue fleeing when he suddenly stopped moving. After all, fleeing like this was exactly what they wanted, and once their backup arrived, it would be time for him to be buried.

Yang Ye pondered deeply for a moment before he gave up on fleeing.

A few more breaths of time passed before the space behind Yang Ye rippled abruptly. It didn’t take long for the middle aged man and old man to appear behind Yang Ye.

Both of them were stunned when they saw Yang Ye standing there with no intention to continue fleeing, and then it didn’t take long for them to become completely vigilant. After all, they didn’t dare act carelessly against Yang Ye at all.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly turned around and glanced at them, “I’ve been waiting for all of you. Come at me!”

Both of them were at a loss for words when they heard him.
