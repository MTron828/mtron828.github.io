Actually, the real reason was that it was very difficult for him to kill her at the time.

As the Northern Sky King’s daughter, how could she not have some treasures to keep her safe? As soon as his sword pressed against her forehead, he’d sensed a strand of energy lock onto his sword.

It wasn’t coming from the old man; it came from Bei Cangyue.

Of course, if he risked his life, he was still confident in his ability to kill her. However, it would waste too much time. Moreover, the old man would definitely lend her a hand. It was even to the extent that the Northern Sky King may show himself.

After all, she was his daughter.

An expert like the Northern Sky King would definitely not just stand by idly as his daughter died. As for him, the important matter at hand was to explore the Sage Ruins, and then head to the Sky Dimension to look for Xiao Qi and Zi’er. Of course, there was one other thing, and he wanted to ask Xiao Qi if she knew how to revive Blood Maiden!

So, Yang Ye didn’t refuse when the old man chose reconciliation.

He stopped once he gained compensation!

A short while later, they stopped. There was an ancient city before them/

The city was extremely old, but it was preserved very well. It wasn’t very large, and it was very small when compared to Northern Sky City. However, the shock from the sight of it was greater than the shock he experienced when he saw Northern Sky City!

Because it was floating in the other. However, it wasn’t relying on any formation to float in the air, and it was being supported by a broken sword!

The broken sword was quite long. It was around 10m long, and that was at least 10 times longer than an ordinary sword. The hilt was against the ground, and the top of the sword was pressed against the center of the city.

A sword was holding up an entire city!

Nansi Yin spoke softly, “What sword is that?”

Yang Ye sized it up carefully. The sword was very ordinary to the point there was nothing exceptional about it. However, Yang Ye understood that some things were extraordinary because they were simply. They were ordinary yet extraordinary!

Yang Ye withdrew his gaze and looked towards the entrance. There were three words above the city gates—Sky Residence City.

Meanwhile, Nansi Yin suddenly said, “Let’s go!”

Yang Ye nodded, and then he walked into the city with her. There were very few buildings in the city, and the sky was gloomy, so it made the city seem quite desolate and ghastly.

They went straight for the main hall of the city. They noticed numerous people gathered there when they arrived, but everyone had quite unsightly expressions on their faces.

Yang Ye and Nansi Yin looked over, and the hall was empty, completely empty.

“An empty city!” Meanwhile, a voice resounded, “What the hell! It’s actually an empty city!”

An empty city!

Yang Ye frowned. He glanced at the surroundings. His intuition told him that there was something unusual about the city.

The people gradually left the hall. They didn’t leave but hid in the shadows to observe the surroundings.

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings and said, “Let’s leave!”

Nansi Yin nodded and went to a deserted corner with Yang Ye.

Yang Ye patted his chest lightly, “Little Fellow, come out here!”

Nansi Yin had a puzzled expression on her face.

Suddenly, a ray of white light flashed, and then a round and chubby little fellow appeared before Yang Ye.

It was Snowy, of course!

Nansi Yin’s eyes lit up when she saw Snowy, and she stretched out her hand to touch Snowy.

Snowy gazed at her, and then Snowy raised her claw to stop Nansi Yin’s hand.

She refused!

Snowy wasn’t someone that just anyone could touch!

Nansi Yin was stunned speechless.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye rubbed Snowy’s head and said, “Little Fellow, look around and tell me where the treasures are.” Snowy was absolutely the best when it came to finding treasures because none could escape her nose!

Snowy blinked, glanced at the surroundings, and pointed right.

It was the main hall’s direction.

Yang Ye took Snowy in his arms and walked in that direction. Meanwhile, Nansi Yin followed him and asked, “Hey, where did you buy that little fellow? I want to get one too!”

Yang Ye stopped, glanced at her, and said, “I didn’t buy her.”

Nansi Yin was stunned, “You didn’t buy her?”

Yang Ye nodded, “I found her!”

Nansi Yin blurted out, “Where? I want to find one too!”

The corners of Yang Ye’s mouth twitched slightly. He ignored her and strode swiftly towards the main hall.

It didn’t take long for them to arrive there, and it was completely empty.

Yang Ye gazed at Snowy. The latter blinked, sized up the surroundings, and then gazed at the wall at the back of the hall.

Yang Ye and Nansi Yin gazed at it too. The wall was smooth as a mirror, and there was nothing special about it.

So, they gazed at Snowy again.

Snowy flew over to the wall, and then she suddenly clenched her right claw. Her eyes opened wide, and then she slammed her little fist against the wall!

Nothing happened.

Snowy blinked. She glanced at her fist, and then punched the wall.

Still nothing happened!

Snowy gazed at Yang Ye, pointed at the wall, and then waved her fist. It seemed like she was asking why nothing happened.

Yang Ye had a slightly embarrassed expression on his face. He hesitated for a moment and said, “Your fist is too small.”

Snowy blinked, glanced at her fist, and then cracked a smile. After that, she waved her claw, and the sword in Yang Ye’s grasp flew into her grasp. She grabbed it with both claws and swung it at the wall.

Hiss!

The entire hall started shaking violently.

Snowy glanced at the surroundings, and then hurried over to Yang Ye’s shoulder while staring at the wall with a curious gaze.

The commotion was noticed by countless people, so it didn’t take long for no less than a few dozen people to gather in the hall while more were still rushing over.

Everyone watched as a crack appeared on the wall.

The crack gradually widened, and it didn’t take long for a passageway to appear before them.

Countless people’s eyes burned with flames of greed when they witnessed this.

Suddenly, a figure shot into the passageway. Once there was a first, a second shot in soon after.

In just a short while, only Yang Ye, Nansi Yin, and Snowy remained.

Nansi Yin asked, “Why didn’t you go in first?”

Yang Ye spoke indifferently, “Do you think a Sage’s inheritance is that easy to get?”

Nansi Yin asked, “You think it’s dangerous?”

Yang Ye replied, “I don’t know. However, it’s definitely not that easy to get. Come on, let’s go have a look!”

Once they entered the passageway, another world appeared before them.

A bamboo forest appeared in front of them, and the bamboo filled their fields of vision.

“We can’t fly here!” Nansi Yin shot a glance into the air and said, “There’s a form of mysterious energy up there!”

Yang Ye replied, “Then we’ll just walk!”

She nodded, and they continued forward. The bamboo forest was huge and stretched far into the distance. But it didn’t take long for them to stop.

They saw three corpses in front of them.

All of them had lost their lives to bamboos straight into the head!

Nansi Yin spoke solemnly, “It really isn’t that safe!”

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings and said, “Come on!”

Nansi Yin was just about to start moving when the bamboo forest around them suddenly started swaying, and then two bamboo beside them suddenly rose up into the air and shot towards them.

Right when she was about to counterattack, the bamboo split apart, and then two rays of silver light shot out from them. They were so swift that Nansi Yin hadn’t even been able to react before they arrived in front of her forehead.

I’m dead!

That was what Nansi Yin thought at this moment.

Suddenly, a sword appeared before her forehead.

Clang!

The silver light were slashed into bits.

However, the bamboo around them started to sway violently, and then all of them actually rose up into the air.

“Be careful! It’s a shaman technique!” Hou Qing’s voice resounded in Yang Ye’s mind, “It’s called the Spirit Control Technique. It can be used to control all things. The person utilizing it has mastered 90% of the technique. It’s someone quite extraordinary. So, be careful.”

The shaman race!

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings, and then he swung his sword horizontally.

Hiss!

Everywhere his sword energy passed, the bamboos were slashed into two. However, a few hundred rays of silver light rained down upon them like a storm.

Yang Ye’s expression didn’t change at all. He took a step forward, and then 10 ethereal swords appeared around him. After that, rays of light crisscrossed. They seemed to have formed a huge ball of light that protected him and Nansi Yin.

Bang! Bang! Bang!

Explosions resounded incessantly. Around 15 minutes later, a ray of light shot up into the air, and then it entered deep within the bamboo forest.

Bang!

That area exploded apart.

A voice resounded, “A sword cultivator!”

The sword energy dispersed, and then Yang Ye and Nansi Yin’s figures appeared once more. Yang Ye looked up, and he saw a woman in a strange dress standing not too far away from them. The reason it seemed strange was because there was a ferocious beast embroidered on her dress, and it seemed ready to pounce on her enemies.

She was barefoot and floating around 10 centimeters in the air. Besides that, there was a small multicolored snake on her foot.

An expert of the shaman race!

Yang Ye glanced at her, and then he swung his sword.

Hiss!

A ray of sword energy appeared before her. However, she didn’t do anything. The small snake on her foot suddenly looked up, and then it opened its mouth and sucked Yang Ye’s sword energy into its stomach.

After that, nothing happened, and it even seemed slightly satisfied.

Yang Ye frowned at the sight of this.

“An Energy Devouring Python!” Hou Qing suddenly said, “Kid, that thing isn’t ordinary at all. Be careful!”

Yang Ye nodded slightly and was about to attack. However, Snowy suddenly patted him on the shoulder and pointed at herself.

Astonishment covered Yang Ye’s face.

Snowy wanted him to let her do it!

While Yang Ye was in a moment of surprise, Snowy had started flying forward slowly on her sword.

Or to be more precise, she was flying towards the snake.

Snowy’s gaze was on the python, and it was filled with excitement. It was like Snowy had found a new toy!

It didn’t take long for Snowy to stop, and then she withdrew an immortal crystal and tossed it to the snake. After that, she waved her claws. She was asking it to follow her!

The woman from the shaman race was stunned speechless.
