Chapter 2080 – Cosmic Star City!

Suddenly, Yang Ye appeared here once more.

Xue’er immediately pounced into his arms, and Yang Ye’s heart almost shattered as she cried.

A long time passed before Xue’er looked up at Yang Ye, “Daddy, stay with Xue’er for one more day, alright? Just one day!”

Yang Ye wiped off her tears and smiled, “Of course!”

Just like that, Yang Ye spent one more day here.

A day later, Yang Ye left.

While he was reluctant, Yang Ye still left. Because it wasn’t time to enjoy life with his family.

In the sky, Yang Lianshuang said, “I’ll only be sending you off until here!”

Yang Ye gazed at her, “You definitely came with me because you have something to say, right?”

“Smart!” Yang Lianshuang smiled, and then she passed a fist-sized stone to him, “A Transmission Stone. If you need something, just say it to this stone. Besides that, according to the information I received, the god race may be about to do something!”

Yang Ye frowned, “The god race?”

Yang Lianshuang nodded slightly, “I’ve analyzed the relationship between all the other races, the god race, and some other mysterious organizations. A very, very long time ago, the god race reigned supreme, so the other races and the mysterious organizations joined forces against them. The god race lost that battle, but the alliance they formed wasn’t able to annihilate the god race. Now, the god race is slowly revealing themselves again. So, I presume many organizations have started to pay attention to them!”

Yang Ye spoke in a low voice, “What do they plan to do?”

She shook her head, “I’m not sure for now. However, it definitely won’t be anything good. Once they show themselves, it’ll definitely be accompanied by a storm of blood. In short, be careful.”

Yang Ye nodded. He seemed to have thought of something and said, “I killed the Sovereign of Man’s son. Help me keep an eye on the Sovereign of Man.”

Yang Lianshuang replied, “We’re monitoring them at all times. Don’t worry, he doesn’t have time for you now!”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Why?”

Yang Lianshuang smiled, “He has to reorganize the organizations within the Human Dimension. Because everyone knows that something serious is about to happen. So, all the races are converging their forces now, but the human race’s situation is the most complicated. It has the 10 paradises, 3 hallowed grounds, and four clans. All of these powers aren’t very obedient!”

Yang Ye said, “But he can’t just remain indifferent after losing a son, right?”

She spoke indifferently, “The Sovereign of Man has 36 sons. While that one he lost wasn’t bad, he can only be ranked in the top 10 of all 35. Right, the Sovereign of Man has over a dozen daughters too. Every single one of them is gorgeous. Don’t fall for them, alright!”

Yang Ye shook his head, “Be careful. Let me know if anything happens.”

Once he finished speaking, Yang Ye didn’t stay a moment longer. He turned around, and a ray of light flashed through the sky.

Yang Lianshuang gazed at where Yang Ye had been standing and spoke softly, “He’s still as ruthless as ever!”

She vanished into the distance.

…

As far as Yang Ye was concerned, the important matter at hand was to get the Soulmend Casket. His strength had improved tremendously, but he still wasn’t confident in being able to fight a Sage.

While he was at the Zen Realm, the gap between him and a Sage still existed. However, it wasn’t that huge anymore.

While there was a gap, it wasn’t to the point of rendering him incapable of fighting back.

Cosmic Star City.

Yang Ye was heading to Cosmic Star City because according to Yang Lianshuang’s information, the Soulmend Casket would be auctioned off there.

Yang Ye flew swiftly on his sword, and it took him almost three days to get there.

Cosmic Star City floated in outer space, and it was extremely huge like a colossus lying in space. There were numerous dark red rays of light around it, and they formed circles that flew around the city.

It was an Anti-Flying Formation!

The red light felt extremely dangerous to Yang Ye, and he knew that if he didn’t stop flying, then he would either die or get heavily injured from them.

Yang Ye glanced at the red circles of light, and then he went to the city entrance.

There was an old man there, and he couldn’t see through the old man.

The old man suddenly opened his eyes when he saw Yang Ye walk over, “The Zen Realm, 100 immortal crystals!”

Yang Ye asked, “An entrance fee?”

The old man nodded, “Anyone who enters the city must pay an entrance fee, and the amount varies by cultivation.”

Yang Ye asked, “What if it’s a Sage?”

The old man replied indifferently, “It’s naturally free for Sages. But you’re not a Sage, right?”

Yang Ye smiled and flicked a spatial ring to the old man.

The old man glanced at it and said, “Go on in!”

Yang Ye was about to enter when the old man suddenly asked, “Is it your first time here?”

Yang Ye nodded.

The old man said, “There’s one thing you should know. Fighting is prohibited in rooms, and you can fight outside. However, you’ll have to pay 10 times the price in compensation if you damage anything.”

Yang Ye gazed at the old man, “Do I look like someone who’ll fight others?”

The old man glanced at Yang Ye and said, “Very!”

Yang Ye’s face froze, and then he said, “I practically never fight!”

Yang Ye walked into the city once he finished speaking.

He wasn’t lying. Because he usually didn’t fight, he killed!

The old man glanced at Yang Ye, and then he rested his body against the wall again.

Huge!

Yang Ye noticed that the city was much larger than he’d expected upon walking in. Just its streets were over 300m wide. It was shocking! Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

There were many people in the city too. Many were rushing in from the outside, and there were many leaving as well. There were people from the human race, spirit race, demon race… In short, all the races could be seen here!

It was like a large family that accommodated all the races!

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings and vanished on the spot.

While he had the Bodhi Leaf, he didn’t dare to act carelessly. After all, he was still quite famous among all the races. So, if anyone recognized him, it would definitely cause endless trouble for him. Thus, Yang Ye wore a black robe and used both the Bodhi Leaf and Sword Domain to conceal himself. Now, even Su Qingshi wouldn’t be able to recognize him, even if she was standing right beside him!

Yang Ye went over to the auction house called the Immortal Treasure Pavilion. The Soulmend Casket would be auctioned here in three days. However, he had to get an invitation to enter the auction.

An invitation!

Yang Ye thought for a moment, and then he walked towards the entrance. However, right when he was about to enter, a woman suddenly appeared in front of him. She seemed to be around the age of 20. She was pretty and had a warm smile that gladdened the hearts of anyone who looked at her!

The man smiled, “Esteemed Guest, may I know what you need? Can I help you with anything?”

Yang Ye sized her up and said, “I want to auction off something!”

She smiled, “May I know what it is?”

Yang Ye said, “Can we talk inside?”

She hurriedly said, “Of course, forgive Xiao Yue. Please come inside!” She gestured for him to enter once she finished speaking.

She led him to a room. The room was quite spacious, and she hurriedly served him a cup of tea once he was seated. Of course, it was no ordinary tea, but it wasn’t very special either.

Meanwhile, she suddenly asked, “May I know what you plan to auction?”

Yang Ye passed a pair of gloves to her.

It was something he’d obtained from one of his enemies, and it was at the Sage Rank! He hadn’t used it since he obtained it because the Sky Dragon made the gloves quite useless in his hands. Once he used the Sky Dragon, his claws were much more terrifying than the gloves.

Xiao Yue was stunned when she saw the gloves, and then she quickly bowed to Yang Ye, “I’m sorry if my previous service wasn’t satisfactory. Please wait a moment while I get Manager Li!”

She quickly ran out of the room once she finished speaking.

A short while later, a middle aged man walked in, and Xiao Yue was behind him. The middle aged man glanced at the gloves that floated before Yang Ye, and then he gazed at Yang Ye and cupped his fist, “I’m a manager here, Li He. You want to auction this treasure?”

Yang Ye nodded.

A smile curled up on the corners of the middle aged man’s face, “May I know if you want crystals or other treasures in return?”

Yang Ye asked, “How many crystals can I get from it?”

The middle aged man thought for a moment and replied, “Around 500,000 immortal crystals, maybe more.”

500,000! Yang Ye was quite surprised. That was a really huge amount. Even though he had Snowy, it would take her at least three to five years to produce so many immortal crystals for him. Moreover, it was even under the condition that Snowy wasn’t lazy. If Snowy slacked off, it would probably take even longer!

The middle aged man thought Yang Ye was displeased and hurriedly said, “This pair of gloves is a great treasure. Unfortunately, it’s clearly made for body cultivators. I’m sure you’re aware how few body cultivators there are. If it was a defensive treasure or a weapon like a spear or sword, it would sell for at least 800,000 or even a million!”

Yang Ye said, “Yes, I understand. I heard you’ll be holding an auction soon. Can you auction it then?”

“Of course!” The middle aged man smiled. Actually, he’d guessed that since Yang Ye had asked for it to be auctioned now, it was clearly so that it would be auctioned in the upcoming auction. After all, countless wealthy experts would be attending it!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye added, “I heard there are conditions to attend the auction…”

“I understand!” Li He smiled and glanced at Xiao Yue. The latter understood what he meant and quickly left. A short while later, she walked in and went over to Yang Ye before respectfully passing a silver card to him!

Li He smiled, “This is our member card. You can join any of our auctions with that.”

Yang Ye nodded, took it, and said, “I’ll be back in three days!”

He turned around and walked away once he finished speaking. However, he suddenly stopped at the door and said, “That little girl isn’t bad. She has quite the discerning gaze, and she’s humble and knows her place. It’s a waste of her talent to keep her as a normal attendant!”

Yang Ye left once he finished speaking.

Xiao Yue’s body stiffened on the spot.

Meanwhile, Li He glanced at her and said, “From today onward, you’ll be our assistant manager!”

Xiao Yue was stunned, and then she hurriedly bowed to him, “Thank you, Manager Li!” At the same time, she said inwardly, “Thank you for praising me, Senior!”

The senior she mentioned was naturally Yang Ye!
