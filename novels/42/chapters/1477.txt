Chapter 1478 – Is It Free?

“Honey!” After Suxin took control of the woman’s body again, she immediately pounced into Yang Ye’s embrace.

How soft and supple!

That was what Yang Ye thought right now.

However, Yang Ye wasn’t in the mood to take advantage of her. The only reason she hugged him was that she considered him her husband. He didn’t want to disrespect those emotions! Moreover, she was worthy of respect because she had been willing to die for love.

Yang Ye released her when she thought up to this point.

She gazed at him with a puzzled expression in her eyes, “Honey?”

Yang Ye remained silent for an instant, and then he said, “Your husband is dead.”

He’d decided to be a little direct. Otherwise, if he continued to act like her husband, it would only make her fall deeper into the illusion that her husband was alive. That would make her obsession with her husband grow deeper.

A short and swift stab was better than one which lasted over a long period. So, he’d chosen to be direct.

“Honey, you....” She gazed at him with astonishment, “Aren’t... aren’t you alive and well?”

Yang Ye fell silent for an instant, and then he walked over to her and just looked at her, “Take a proper look. Am I really your husband?”

She took Yang Ye’s hand while anxiousness covered her face, “Honey, don’t scare me. You... you’re my husband!”

Yang Ye frowned. He was sure that if he looked through her eyes, he definitely looked just like her dead husband. Once a person experiences pain that’s beyond their limits, such situations might occur. They might create a world out of their imagination, and there was no pain in that world.

Just like this very moment, in the woman’s world, her husband wasn’t dead!

So, how would he pull her out of her imaginary world?

Yang Ye remained silent for a long time, and then the slaughter intent and sword intent within him surged out. He gazed at her and said, “Did your husband comprehend slaughter intent and sword intent?”

Suxin seemed to be stunned as she asked, “Honey, when... when did you comprehend slaughter intent and sword intent?”

Her condition is extremely serious! Yang Ye shook his head. He knew that ordinary methods wouldn’t work, so he remained silent for a moment before he took Suxin’s hand, “Let’s go to bed!”

As he spoke, he grabbed her hand and walked towards the bed.

Suxin’s face instantly turned red when she heard that, and there was an embarrassed expression in her eyes. It didn’t take long for Yang Ye to bring her to the bed. He didn’t hold back and just wrapped his arm around her waist and said, “Let’s go to bed!”

“Honey....” Suxin’s voice was soft like the buzz of a mosquito, and her face was completely red. She was indescribably shy.

Yang Ye looked her in the eyes and started to help her undo her clothes. In the beginning, Suxin had been slightly hesitant, but it didn’t take long for her to stop resisting, and she just allowed Yang Ye to do it. Yang Ye wasn’t joking, and he really removed it all. It didn’t take long for her to be standing in her undergarments.

Her face blushed even redder like a fiery cloud, but it was also much more charming.

The body Suxin occupied right now was like a newly ripened peach, and it emanated an enticing aura that made others wish for nothing more than to take her and swallow her!

Fortunately, Yang Ye didn’t lose his composure. Even though he was no gentleman, he wasn’t one who allowed his lower body to control him. Moreover, he was a sword cultivator, and one who possessed the Enlightened Sword Heart. If he was unwilling, then all beautiful women wouldn’t be able to tempt him. Of course, he was a man, so it was normal for him to take a few glances at a beautiful woman.

After he took a few glances.... Actually he took more than a few glances.

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts and placed his right hand on her shoulder. After that, he slowly moved to kiss her lips. Meanwhile, she closed her eyes slowly and seemed like she was his for the taking.

Right when his lips were about to touch her lips, she suddenly opened her eyes, and Yang Ye had stopped. Suxin stared at him, and a short while passed before she suddenly struggled free of his embrace and turned around.

A smile curled up on the corners of his mouth when he witnessed this scene. He knew that his plan was working.

The strength of Suxin’s love for her husband was obvious from the fact that she’d died for love. So, it was definitely only her husband who resided in her heart. In other words, it was absolutely impossible for her to betray her husband. His previous actions had been done just to determine if she was beyond saving.

Obviously, she wasn’t.

Regardless of whether it had been done instinctively or consciously, it was obvious from her refusal that she was rejecting him!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye said, “I’m not your husband!” Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“You are!” She suddenly turned around to look at him.

Yang Ye gazed at her for a long time, and then he nodded, “Since you say so, then let’s go to bed.”

As he spoke, he stretched out his hand and pinched the corner of her undergarment. He merely had to pull lightly, and she would be completely exposed before his eyes.

Yang Ye gazed at her and said, “Do you really want to do this?”

She just gazed at him in silence.

Yang Ye nodded, and then he pulled slightly. However, she suddenly grabbed his hand, and then her figure appeared at the center of the room. Moreover, she’d worn her clothes as well.

A moment of silence ensued, and then she spoke slowly, “Honey, I can’t today. I’ll entertain you another day, alright?”

Yang Ye chuckled, and then he walked over to her, “Miss Suxin, why lie to yourself? You’re rejecting me. Just ask yourself. Aren’t you rejecting me?”

She remained silent for a long time, and then she said, “I’m not rejecting you, Honey!”

“You aren’t?” Yang Ye chuckled, and then he wrapped his arm around her waist. The latter’s figure stiffened while Yang Ye said, “Since you aren’t, then let’s do some things that a couple should do!” As soon as he finished speaking, he moved his lips to kiss her.

However, Yang Ye was stunned.

Because he’d really kissed her lips. She actually hadn’t resisted this time.

Why hasn’t she resisted? Yang Ye glanced at her, and then he suddenly felt pain come from his stomach.

Boom!

After that, a muffled explosion resounded as his figure flew out the door and flew around 10km away.

A short while passed before Yang Ye crawled up from the ground. He looked up at Suxin who was still within the cottage in the distance. At this moment, she was staring blankly at her own hand, and there was a lost expression in her eyes.

“Are you wondering why you attacked me?” Meanwhile, Yang Ye appeared in front of her, “You don’t have to think so much about it. Because I’m not your husband. That’s why you’re instinctively rejecting me.”

“I....” She stared blankly at her hand and was at a loss for words.

Yang Ye looked her in the eyes, “Miss Suxin, I know that you’re in extreme pain from losing your husband. However, have you thought about the pain your husband would feel if he found out that you’re deceiving yourself and randomly acknowledging someone else as your husband? You’re just tricking yourself and torturing yourself!”

She had a lost expression in her eyes, and she remained silent.

Yang Ye continued, “Miss Suxin, take a closer look. Am I your husband?”

She looked up at him. As she looked and looked, her expression suddenly started to warp.

As soon as he noticed that, Yang Ye hurriedly added, “I’m not your husband because he died a long time ago.”

“NO!” A savage expression suddenly appeared on her face, “My husband isn’t dead. He’s an extraordinary and peerless genius. How could he possibly die? It’s impossible!”

As she spoke, she slapped her palm against Yang Ye’s chest.

Bang!

Yang Ye was blasted flying again.

Even though he’d been hit by her, he heaved a sigh of relief in his heart. She has finally come out from that imaginary world of hers.

This time, Yang Ye didn’t stand up and acted like he was dead.

She’d returned to reality, so it wouldn’t take long for her to recall the past, and then she would remember whether her husband was really alive. However, she might not be in a normal state of mind during that period, and she couldn’t be provoked at all. Otherwise, she might go berserk!

Just like a moment ago, she’d struck him right away!

She was at her maddest state during this period!

So, it was best to act like he was dead. Once she figured out everything, she would probably vanish on her own. At that time, his mission would be completed.

Sure enough, it was exactly as Yang Ye had expected. Her expression was changing incessantly. It was savage for a while, then it was muddled, then it was covered in pain, then.... In short, she didn’t look normal at all. Moreover, the aura she emanated was extremely violent, and it caused the space around her to tremble incessantly. It was an extremely shocking sight!

Yang Ye’s eyelids twitched at the sight of this. Even though Suxin was using someone else’s body, she was still very strong! However, it did make sense. Based on what the owner of that body had told Yang Ye, Suxin had once been a supreme expert as well. So, her strength was definitely not inferior to the owner of that body.

Otherwise, Suxin’s soul wouldn’t have been able to take control of that body.

Simply speaking, it didn’t matter who had control of that body. He couldn’t afford to offend any one of them!

Since he couldn’t afford to offend them, he could only hide!

A long time passed before the surroundings fell silent. Yang Ye felt that something was off, so he raised his head and looked over, and he just happened to see a face. It was naturally Suxin’s face. She’d appeared in front of him without him even realizing it.

I can’t continue acting! Yang Ye stood up and glanced at her. At this moment, there was no tender affection in her eyes. However, it wasn’t icy cold as well. Obviously, Suxin was still in control, but she’d returned to normal.

“The Epoch Realm?” She shook her head, “Too weak.”

As soon as she finished speaking, she looked him in the eyes, “I can help you advance to the Undying Realm or even surpass it. Do you want that?”

Yang Ye gulped and asked, “Is it free?”
