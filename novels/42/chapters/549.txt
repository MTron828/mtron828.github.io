Chapter 550 – A Half-Saint!

The old man glanced indifferently at Yang Ye and said, “You reckless little bastard! How dare you challenge my Exalted Han Empire? An ant like you intends to fight my Exalted Han Empire to the death?”

Luo Jun stood up. At this moment, his handsome face was swollen to the point he was simply impossible to recognize, and his face was covered in resentment!

Luo Jun bowed respectfully to the old man and said, “Ancestor, I’ve brought shame to you!”

The old man waved his hand and said, “That fellow obtained fortuitous encounters and possesses great Karmic Luck. The energy of two territories isn’t sufficient to deal with him. Once this matter is dealt with, I’ll allow you to take control of the empire. Once you possess the Faith Energy of three territories, then not to mention ants like the Sword Emperor and Martial God, you’ll even be able to kill Monarch Realm experts with ease!”

Luo Jun was overjoyed when he heard this. Because since this ancestor of his had spoken, then the emperor of the Exalted Han Empire would be changing!

“Luo Shenji! The Demon Emperor had a gloomy expression on his face as he said, “Good! Good! I never expected that your Exalted Han Empire would dispatch 2 ninth rank Monarch Realm experts just to deal with Yang Ye! What extravagance!” He’d noticed as soon as Luo Shenji arrived here, and he wanted to stop Luo Shenji. However, it was too late because Luo Tian was obstructing his path.

“It’s 3 not 2!” Right at this moment, another old man appeared before everyone.

“Luo Badao!” The Demon Emperor’s eyelids twitched. The Exalted Han Empire had 4 ninth rank Monarch Realm experts, and 3 had appeared here right now!

The old man called Luo Badao gazed at the Demon Emperor and said, “Demon Emperor, I’m aware that unless at least 5 ninth rank Monarch Realm experts join forces against you, then it’s impossible to stop you from leaving with the spatial techniques you possess. We’ve never thought about stopping you from leaving, so you can leave. We’re determined to eliminate Yang Ye today! No one can save him, not even you!”

“You intend to break the agreement between the three races?” said the Demon Emperor in a low voice.

Luo Badao shook his head and said, “We don’t want to break the agreement. Yang Ye is a human yet you insist on considering him as a part of your demon race. If Yang Ye understood his place a little, then we would just turn a blind eye to it. Unfortunately, he overestimates his ability and actually intends to fight my Exalted Han Empire to the death. Since it’s like that, then we can only kill him!”

The Demon Emperor gazed at the Dragon Emperor, but the latter laughed coldly and said, “Demon Emperor, if Yang Ye were a member of my demon race, then I would join forces with you to protect him even if there’s irreconcilable enmity between him and my Dragon Race. Unfortunately, he isn’t. Those of another race definitely have conflicting intentions. So, my Dragon Race won’t protect that human.”

The Demon Emperor looked at the Grand Elder of the devil race, but the latter smiled and said, “Demon Emperor, don’t look at me. Even though my devil race and your demon race are allies, Yang Ye is a human. If I do help you save him, it’s very likely that he’ll become a formidable enemy for my devil race in the future!”

The Demon Emperor took a deep breath, and then he flashed over to Yang Ye’s side.

At this moment, Yang Ye was in quite a bad state. His right arm was completely crippled from executing the Heavenrend Drawing Technique just now. Coupled with the Sword Domain which he’d forcefully activated earlier, he was almost completely exhausted. Now, he’d even suffered the full force attack of an extraordinary expert. Even if he had the Mortal Emperor Armor to negate most of the attack, he’d still almost died!

Cracks had appeared on Yang Ye’s body, and it seemed like glass that had suffered impact. Even though it hadn’t shattered completely, his body was really covered in cracks. Blood was flowing incessantly from Yang Ye’s seven apertures as well.

At this moment, Yang Ye seemed as if he was made of blood. If it wasn’t for the Greenwood Spirit within his body that was ceaselessly repairing his body, he would have probably perished by now!

A trace of sorrow flashed through the Demon Emperor’s eyes as he gazed at Yang Ye who was immobile on the ground, and he said, “I can’t save you!”

“Take... take... take my friends with you!” Yang Ye spoke with great difficulty.

The Demon Emperor glanced at Lu Jianyao and Yin Xuan’er. At this moment, Lu Jianyao was sobbing uncontrollably while sorrow covered Yin Xuan’er’s face. Even a formidable existence like the Demon Emperor had no choice but to make a compromise when facing the joint forces of 3 ninth rank Monarch Realm experts from the Exalted Han Empire. So, what could two weak women like them do? They couldn’t do anything!

“They’ll be fine!” The Demon Emperor guaranteed.

“Tell... tell the little fellow I can’t go see her anymore!” Yang Ye spoke weakly. This time, he was really helpless. Because even the formidable and mysterious little girl wasn’t able to save him anymore. According to her, not a single one of those 3 geezers were existences that she could go against right now!

He was very unwilling, truly extremely unwilling. But he was completely helpless. Because they were much stronger than him, and they were larger in number as well!

The Demon Emperor sighed lightly, and his voice was filled with helplessness.

Yang Ye forcefully endured the violet pain throughout his body and stood up slowly. As he moved, his body seemed like delicate porcelain that had been knocked against something, and it started to crack apart while blood flowed incessantly. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Even if he was going to die, he wanted to die standing!

Luo Shenji glanced indifferently at Yang Ye, and then his right hand clawed at Yang Ye. His palm instantly traveled through space and appeared above Yang Ye’s head.

Yang Ye closed his eyes slowly while the images of Su Qingshi, Xiao Yuxi, Qin Xiyue, and his unborn child appeared in his mind. My child. I promised that I would return to watch my child’s birth....

However, Luo Shenji’s palm stopped just a few centimeters above Yang Ye’s head, and then it couldn’t descend no matter what.

The 3 supreme experts of the Exalted Han Empire frowned.

The Demon Emperor smiled instead!

“Cough, cough....” Light coughing resounded, and then everyone looked towards the source of the coughing, and they saw a hunched old man walking slowly towards Yang Ye while supporting himself with a walking stick.

The gazes of everyone in the surroundings descended onto the old man.

The expressions on the faces of those 3 supreme experts of the Exalted Han Empire had become solemn. On the other hand, the Grand Elder of the devil race and the Dragon Emperor exchanged glances while both of them noticed confusion in each other’s eyes. They practically knew all the ninth rank Monarch Realm experts throughout the continent, but they’d never seen this old man!

What sort of relationship does he have with Yang Ye? Could it be that it’s this old man who has been backing Yang Ye?

The hunched old man was naturally Elder Mu. He walked over to Yang Ye’s side, gazed at Yang Ye who was covered in injuries, shook his head, and then said, “You seem to have fallen into quite a sorry state since we last met!”

Yang Ye heaved a sigh of relief in his heart when he saw Elder Mu, and then he cracked a smile and said, “Elder Mu, I would really be dead if you still didn’t show yourself!”

Elder Mu shook his head and smiled. “I’ve always felt that difficulties are the best to promote one’s growth. So, I’ve never stepped forward to lend you a hand. But I really have no choice now. 3 ninth rank Monarch Realm experts.... Haha, what extravagance. They clearly intend to bully the weak. In any case, you’re at least half a disciple of mine, so how could I allow them to bully you?”

As he spoke, Elder Mu gazed at the Demon Emperor and said, “Demon Emperor, we meet again!”

The Demon Emperor nodded.

Elder Mu smiled, and then he gazed at Luo Jun before he shook his head and said, “Needless to say, you’re the worst amongst all the Mortal Emperors of the past. Because you actually need to rely on others to support you in a battle against someone in the same realm of cultivation. You’re really too useless when compared to that little girl from the An Clan or this disciple of mine. The heavens are really growing blind!”

“Who exactly are you!?” Meanwhile, Luo Shenji spoke in a low voice.

“I’m just a geezer who takes care of graves!” Elder Mu said, “If this disciple of mine was injured by Luo Jun, then it was because of his lacking skill, and he deserved to die. But a ninth rank Monarch Realm profounder like you is actually bullying the weak. I really can’t stand by idly anymore.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Elder Mu’s imposing aura instantly changed. The aura he emanated as he stood there was even a few times more terrifying than the aura Yang Ye’s Heavenrend Drawing Technique had when he utilized it against the nine colored divine dragon!

The expressions of those 3 supreme experts from the Exalted Han Empire changed drastically. Even the expressions of the Dragon Emperor and the Grand Elder of the devil race had changed drastically. There was such an expert on the continent?

“Try and resist this!” Elder Pu tapped his walking stick in Luo Shenji’s direction. A wave of fluctuation arose in space, and then the image of a stick formed from energy appeared in front of Luo Shenji. The latter didn’t dare act carelessly in the slightest, and he slapped his palm against it.

At this moment, time suddenly froze, and then everyone watched with puzzled gazes as the stick image actually curved and struck directly against Luo Shenji’s chest. After that, Luo Shenji remained motionless on the spot as if he was a puppet.

Bang!

Luo Shenji’s figure was blasted flying, and he transformed into a black dot that vanished in the horizon.

“NO!!!” Luo Shenji’s furious howl that was filled with terror resounded, and then an enormous explosion that shook the world resounded!

A ninth rank Monarch Realm expert had been instantly annihilated!

Luo Badao and Luo Tian’s expressions turn grim, and their eyes were filled with astonishment!

“Time! The energy of Time! You... you... you’re not a ninth rank Monarch Realm expert, you’re a Half-Saint! You’re actually a Half-Saint Realm expert! How could this be possible? How could there be another Half-Saint in the human race besides the Half-Saint of my Exalted Han Empire!?” Luo Badao gazed at Elder Mu with disbelief, and his eyes were filled with astonishment.

A Half-Saint!The eyelids of the devil race’s Grand Elder and the Dragon Emperor twitched when they heard this. They were very clearly aware what those words represented! Even though there was an inherent difference between a Half-Saint and a true Saint, a Half-Saint had already grasped control over a small amount of the energy of Time, and that wasn’t something that a Monarch Realm expert could resist!

Most importantly, this Half-Saint was from the human race, and it was undoubtedly a huge calamity to the devil race and demon race!

Elder Mu gazed at Luo Jun, and then Luo Tian and Luo Badao’s expressions changed drastically. Luo Badao hurriedly said, “Since you are part of our human race, then why are you acting against the Mortal Emperor. Could it be that you don’t know how the Mortal Emperor is related to the fate of our human race?”

“The fate of the human race?” Elder Mu shook his head and said, “What does that have to do with me? All I know is that all of you want to kill my disciple. Since it’s like that, then I’ll kill your junior as well and allow all of you to experience what it’s like to be bullied!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Elder Mu suddenly stamped his foot, and then a faint ripple flashed out and instantly arrived before Luo Jun. Luo Jun was horrified by this. Luo Tian and Luo Badao’s figures flashed, but their speed was extraordinarily slow as if they’d been slowed down by a few dozen times. So, they could only watch helplessly as that ripple swept towards Luo Jun.

Right at this moment, an old man in a yellow robe appeared before Luo Jun, and then both Luo Tian and Luo Badao’s speeds had suddenly returned to normal!

Another Half-Saint!
