Chapter 2270 – I’m Kindhearted!

The energy was like a storm. Everywhere it passed, shocking ripples surged through space!

After he did that, the old man turned around and walked away.

He was beyond confident!

However…

A sword howl resounded, and then the old man stopped abruptly. He turned around, and he saw a ray of sword energy the instant he did that.

A moment later, the energy he emanated had vanished without a trace. At the same time, the sword energy in his eyes rapidly grew in size and speed!

He’d never seen such a swift attack!

It was so swift that he couldn’t even dodge it!

Hiss!

The sword energy shot through his chest, and he was instantly blasted far away!

Bang!

As soon as he descended to the ground, the old man slammed his cane into the ground. In an instant, the ground below him cracked open, and the powerful force of it stopped the old man from being pushed back even more!

The old man glanced at his chest. There was a huge hole there, and a ray of sword energy was still flickering there. However, it was forcefully trapped by a ball of green light.

Obviously, the ball of green light wasn’t ordinary!

The old man looked up at the middle aged man, and his eyes were filled with fear.

Deep fear, and a trace of terror!

One attack!

If he didn’t have that defensive treasure, he would have been killed in an instant!

Someone in this world could actually kill him in an instant!

But he was a True Dao Realm expert!

The old man was beyond shocked!

Such an expert actually existed in this world!

The middle aged man glanced indifferently at the old man, and the latter’s expression changed, “I’m the Vice Sect Master of the Martial Sect, please forgive me for my offense!”

He mentioned the Martial Sect to make the middle aged man fear him.

“The Martial Sect?” The middle aged man frowned slightly, “I’ve never heard of it!”

The old man was at a loss for words.

Meanwhile, the middle aged man glanced at the ball of green light at the old man’s chest, “That’s quite interesting. Unfortunately, you’re too weak. You…” Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

He suddenly looked toward the distant sky, “Huh? Interesting!”

He transformed into a ray of light that vanished into the sky.

Meanwhile, the old man heaved a sigh of relief. But it didn’t take long for quite an unsightly expression to appear on his face.

He’d been ignored!

The middle aged man had openly ignored him. As far as he was concerned, the middle aged man hadn’t killed him because the middle aged man didn’t take him seriously at all. It was no different than the decision to stomp on an ant, it didn’t matter if a person stomped on the ant or not!

He’d been ignored!

Ignored like a weakling!

A long time passed before the old man took a deep breath. No matter what, he’d survived.

Meanwhile, the green ball of light in his chest gradually turned ethereal and vanished.

The old man’s heart truly hurt from the sight of this.

The green ball of light was a protective treasure he’d spent a huge price to obtain, but it was gone, just like that!

His heart was bleeding!

Moreover, while he’d escaped death, he’d been heavily injured, and it was an injury that would take at least a year or two to recuperate from!

“The Primordial Pagoda!” The old man suddenly thought of the Primordial Pagoda!

“They say that it’s a divine treasure for healing. If I had it, these injuries would take just a few days to heal. Moreover, Yang Ye still has the Bodhi Tree and Primordial Axe of Creation…” The old man muttered, and then he vanished on the spot.

…

At this moment, Yang Ye and An Nanjing were still in the passageway, but their expressions were quite unsightly. Especially Yang Ye, his face was covered in ghastly killing intent! Because they had encountered quite a few experts until now!

All of them were coming for him!

A long time passed. Finally, a black vortex appeared ahead.

Yang Ye closed his eyes slowly, “Be careful!”

An Nanjing nodded.

A moment later, they entered the vortex.

Around 15 minutes later, they felt their feet touch the ground, and the surroundings were calm once more.

They opened their eyes, and an extremely old man stood before them. The old man had snow white hair, eyebrows that were so long they practically reached his chest, and deep wrinkles throughout his face. They simply seemed like they were carved with a blade!

He was extremely old!

That was Yang Ye and An Nanjing’s first impression of him!

The old man glanced at Yang Ye and An Nanjing. In the end, his gaze descended onto Yang Ye, “You’re Yang Ye, right?”

Yang Ye just nodded and didn’t try to conceal it.

The old man nodded slightly, “I’m the Vice Patriarch of the initial race. I’m here because we are aware of your strength, and ordinary people would only be like whetstones to you. So, in order to avoid unnecessary sacrifices, I’ve come myself.’

Yang Ye replied indifferently, “And?”

The old man glanced at Yang Ye, “Two choices. One, you hand those three treasures over yourself; two, I kill you and take them myself!”

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings. The spirit energy here was much denser than the large universe. Of course, the large universe wasn’t much inferior. As for the current large universe, it couldn’t compare to this universe at all!

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts and said, “If I hand them over, will your initial race let us live?”

The old man replied indifferently, “We’ll keep your corpses intact!”

“Why?” Yang Ye was astounded, “Don’t you just want those treasures? Can’t we keep our lives and just give them to you?”

“How laughable!” The old man replied indifferently, “Yang Ye, according to the information we received, you’re quite an outstanding person, so how could you be so ignorant and laughable? Have you not heard of pulling out weeds by the root? My initial race never leaves potential troubles behind. Especially when it’s a genius with your talent. My initial race will never let you live, or you may bring unnecessary trouble to my race!”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and said, “In other words, giving it to you or not will still end in death?”

The old man replied, “You’ll die an easier death if you hand it over.”

Yang Ye’s lips curled up into a smile, “Are you not confident in yourself?”

The old man’s eyes narrowed slightly while a cold glow flashed through them.

Yang Ye smiled, “You’re a True Dao Realm expert, so your strength isn’t just a little stronger than us, but you didn’t just attack. You’re asking me to hand it over instead. Hmm, let me guess, what are you afraid of? Oh, it should be the Primordial Axe of Creation, right?”

The old man’s face fell.

The Primordial Axe of Creation!

The initial race had the best understanding of how terrifying it was!

All those years ago, it had almost caused the initial race to suffer tremendous losses! Moreover, he’d personally witnessed what happened then. So, he was afraid. Of course, he was afraid of the Primordial Axe of Creation and not Yang Ye!

If Yang Ye disregarded everything and unsealed it, then he would have no choice but to flee!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly grinned, “There’s no need to worry, I won’t unseal it. I’m serious, I definitely won’t!”

The old man’s eyes narrowed slightly, “You’ll be the first to die if you unseal it!”

“Indeed!” Yang Ye smiled, “So why would I unseal it? Even if I die, I won’t unseal it!”

The old man gazed at Yang Ye for a long time and said, “Trying to scare me? How laughable.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he appeared in front of Yang Ye and slammed his palm down. The powerful energy within his palm caused the space around Yang Ye to warm into an extreme arc!

In that arc of space, an independent expanse of space had been formed, or it should be described as a dead expanse of space!

At this moment, Yang Ye couldn’t rely on anything in this world, including the laws, spirit energy, and everything else!

It had isolated him from the world!

The world had become a cage!

This was the special ability of True Dao Realm experts. They could isolate others from the world, and it was no different than crippling the person’s strength!

Because people relied on the world, like the space, laws, spirit energy, and fire elements in the world. However, True Dao Realm experts were capable of creating a dead expanse of space that isolated a person from the outside world!

This was the difference between experts at the True Dao Realm and below, and it was what made them terrifying!

If Yang Ye was an ordinary Sage, he would definitely die. Not to mention him, even ordinary Progenitors would be incapable of resisting this ability of a True Dao Realm expert. However, Yang Ye was unlike ordinary Sages!

A sword howl resounded abruptly, and then an explosion resounded. After that, the old man was pushed 300m away!

The old man glanced at his hand, and there was an extremely deep injury there!

He looked up at Yang Ye while disbelief filled his eyes, “Impossible… How could you possibly… T-That’s a Domain! The Sword Domain! Your attainments in the Sword Domain are actually this great!”

The Sword Domain!

True Dao Realm experts could isolate people from this world, but Yang Ye’s Sword Domain could do the same. The only difference was that the True Dao Realm’s isolation was a form of restraint, and Yang Ye’s was a form of transcendence! It transcended the world!

The Sword Domain was a domain of its own, it was a domain that belonged to Yang Ye! So, he didn’t have to be suppressed by the special ability of True Dao Realm experts!

That was why he could kill Xiao Lou with just three attacks that day!

Of course, the main reason was that he’d ignited his Progenitor Realm sword intent and slaughter intent!

Meanwhile, the astonishment in the old man’s eyes transformed into the desire to kill, “Amazing! You actually possess such ability. Looks like I absolutely can’t let you live!”

He immediately charged at Yang Ye once he finished speaking!

Yang Ye closed his eyes slowly, “I am kindhearted, but the world forces me to go insane. Kill! I’ll kill until there’s no one left! I’ll kill until blood forms rivers!”
