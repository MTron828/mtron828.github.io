Chapter 2283 – I’ve Never Shrunk Back!

Yang Ye’s speed was extremely swift, so the old man hadn’t even been able to react before Yang Ye’s sword arrived above him.

Yang Ye’s sword descended!

The world cracked open before it!

The old man’s expression changed, and then…

Bang!

A wave of powerful aura surged out from him.

The sword energy vanished, and the old man was over 10km away. However, a wisp of blood seeped out slowly from the old man’s forehead. There was a gash there.

The old man stared at Yang Ye, “What a powerful attack!”

Suddenly, Yang Ye raised his hand and swung his sword at the old man from afar.

Bang! Bang!

Two types of intents tore through the air with the sword energy, and space was obliterated before them.

The old man calmed down. There was no fear in his eyes as he faced this attack. He clenched his right fist, and then a thick layer of ice formed around it. A moment later, he slammed it forward.

Hiss!

Yang Ye’s sword energy was instantly frozen, and a huge expanse of space before the old man was frozen in this instant, even Yang Ye. However, it only took a moment for a sword howl to resound, and then the ice in the surroundings exploded apart and descended as a rain of ice.

A vicious glow flashed through the old man’s eyes at the sight of this, and then he stomped his right foot down and transformed into a beam of ice that shot forward. Meanwhile, Yang Ye vanished on the spot.

Bang!

An explosion rumbled through the sky. In an instant, the clouds in a huge area vanished without a trace, and both of them immediately separated.

The old man stopped after moving around 30km away, but Yang Ye had been pushed more than 30km away.

Obviously, Yang Ye had been at a disadvantage in this collision, but his expression was calm. Conversely, the old man had a solemn expression on his face. Because he was at the True Dao Realm while Yang Ye was just at the Progenitor Realm!

Yang Ye looked down at his chest. There was a thin layer of ice around him. Needless to say, the ice was very strong, and even his dual intents weren’t able to stop the ice from getting close to him.

Yang Ye stomped his right foot down lightly. In an instant, the ice around him vanished, and then he looked up at the old man and grinned, “Let’s continue!”

Yang Ye swiftly raised his hand, and at the moment his hand descended, his sword was above the old man’s head.

The old man’s reaction wasn’t slow at all. He tapped his right foot down and flashed 3km back. However, as soon as he stopped, Yang Ye’s sword was still above him and had gotten closer.

The old man’s expression finally changed.

When it was about to strike his head, a pair of icy cold palms suddenly clamped down on Yang Ye’s sword, stopping Yang Ye’s sword just as it struck the old man’s head. The sword merely sunk down by half an inch before it was fully stopped.

It seemed like time had frozen at this moment!

The old man stared at Yang Ye while strands of cold energy surged out madly from within him. A short while later, Yang Ye’s sword and hands started to freeze. A smile curled up on the corners of Yang Ye’s mouth, and then he closed his eyes. An instant later, his figure turned ethereal as if he wasn’t in this world.

The Sword Domain!

As soon as Yang Ye activated the Sword Domain, the old man’s expression changed drastically. Meanwhile, Yang Ye’s sword shook and slashed down.

Hiss!

Along with a pair of palms that flew off into the air, the old man was blasted over 30km away.

Yang Ye was about to attack again when he suddenly frowned. He turned around and saw a spear shooting through the air. A cold glow flashed through Yang Ye’s eyes, and then he raised his hand and stabbed.

At the instant his sword stabbed against the spear, his entire arm felt numb. Suddenly, a foot slammed at his chest. Yang Ye’s reaction was swift and grabbed it with his left hand, and then he kicked as well.

Bang! Bang!

Two muffled bangs resounded, and then two figures were blasted away.

Yang Ye pushed his right hand forward lightly as he stood 3km away, and he stopped on the spot. Meanwhile, a woman was standing not too far away from him. She wore silver armor, held a spear, and had an icy cold expression on her face.

A Progenitor Realm expert!

She wasn’t at the True Dao Realm but the Progenitor Realm, and her age was around the same as him.

Yang Ye glanced at her and the old man, “You’re together? No, you aren’t.” He’d noticed that the old man had vigilance toward the woman!

The old man glanced at her and gazed at Yang Ye, “Yang Ye, I advise you not to go to the Shiyuan Clan. You’ll be able to live a while longer if you do.”

The old man transformed into a ray of white light that vanished into the sky.

Suddenly, Yang Ye vanished on the spot, and he was far away in the sky too. The woman suddenly looked in that direction and frowned slightly.

Meanwhile, the old man’s expression changed drastically. He turned around swiftly, and a sword had arrived behind him.

The Sword Domain.

The Sword Domain combined with two types of peak Progenitor Realm intents. Yang Ye’s sword descended soundlessly at the old man.

It was much stronger than any attack Yang Ye had executed previously!

Bang!

A strand of cold energy swept out from within the old man. In an instant, he was covered in a thick layer of ice. At the same time, a ray of cold energy surged up into the air and enveloped Yang Ye.

Yang Ye didn’t dodge it and just swung his sword down.

Bang!

The sword sliced open the ice around the old man, and when it sliced down through the old man’s head, a black shadow suddenly flashed out of the old man’s body and vanished into the sky.

Hiss!

The old man’s body was instantly sliced into two. However, the old man’s soul had left and vanished into the sky.

Yang Ye didn’t pursue the old man because a wisp of blood was slowly flowing out the corner of his mouth. He’d taken the old man’s attack head-on just now, and he’d paid that price to destroy the old man’s body.

Just the old man’s body!

That was his limit.

If he wanted to kill a True Dao Realm expert in an instant, he had to ignite his intents!

Yang Ye licked off the blood from the corner of his mouth and looked up at the sky, “Listen! No matter which power you’re from, so long as you dare to attack me, I’ll dare to kill you.”

A moment of silence ensued, and then a voice came from the sky, “We’ll see about that.”

Yang Ye replied coldly, “Come at me whenever you want!”

Yang Ye gazed at the woman once he finished speaking. The latter tightened her grip on her spear while vigilance appeared on her face. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“All of you are trying to stop me from going to the Shiyuan Clan!” Yang Ye continued, “Let me guess, it’s probably for two reasons. Firstly, you want those three divine treasures. Secondly, it’s probably because you don’t want the Shiyuan Clan to obtain them. Right?”

“Yes!” She looked him in the eye with a vigilant expression, but there was no fear on her face.

They didn’t want the Shiyuan Clan to get those treasures!

Yang Ye closed his eyes slowly, “The other five clans have started taking action too, right?”

She replied, “Not just them!”

Not just them!

Yang Ye gazed at her, and she said, “You won’t get to the Shiyuan Clan. Even if you succeed, you’ll be dead.”

Yang Ye asked, “Do you have any suggestions?”

She replied, “Hand over those three treasures, and then go anywhere you want.”

Yang Ye grinned, “I’ve experienced bitterness and pain in my life, but I’ve never shrunk back in my lifetime.”

She gazed at him for a long time and said, “Then let’s wait and see?”

She vanished on the spot once she finished speaking.

Only Yang Ye and the woman in a red dress remained here.

Yang Ye put his sword away and gazed at her, “Let’s go!”

Yang Ye vanished into the distance once he finished speaking. The woman fell silent for a moment and spoke softly, “I may die before my lifespan is up! That’s not how you do things!”

She shook her head and vanished on the spot as well.

Once they vanished, the woman from before appeared here again, and a middle aged man was standing in front of her. The middle aged man glanced in the direction Yang Ye and the woman in a red dress had left toward, and then he said, “You were right to not attack. He isn’t just slightly strong!”

The woman spoke solemnly, “Father, our Luoli clan doesn’t have to get mixed up in this. Isn’t it better to just let the other clans fight for it?”

The middle aged man shook his head slightly, “You can’t think of it like that. If my Luoli Clan doesn’t interfere in this, there will be two outcomes. Outcome number one, the other clans will not fight for it either, as they won’t let another take advantage of their hard work. As for outcome number two, the others will fight for it, but they will intentionally act against our clan while doing that. Besides that, if those three treasures are to fall into the Shiyuan Clan’s hands, then the Shiyuan Clan will probably be at the top of the six clans. Similarly, if they fall into our clan’s hands…”

She suddenly said, “We’ll suffer a threat of annihilation, right?”

“Not at all!” The middle aged man shook his head, “The Immortal Estate is so strong and overbearing, but why don’t the other powers act against them? When your strength is at a certain level, others will not act against you, they will only acknowledge your strength.”

The woman frowned slightly, “Just three divine treasures can bring our clan to the Immortal Estate’s level?”

“Yes!” The middle aged man spoke softly, “The Primordial Axe of Creation can!”

She spoke solemnly, “But Yang Ye is very terrifying.”

The middle aged man smiled, “If he knows how to act according to the situation, then I would fear him. However, didn’t you notice? He doesn’t know how to do anything like that. He plans to fight the Shiyuan Clan just for a woman. A person like him is just someone who has all brawn but no brains, he’s nothing worth worrying about. No matter what, our Luoli Clan must fight for those treasures.”

The woman fell silent. But there was a wisp of worry in her eyes.

…

Around two hours later, Yang Ye and the woman stopped.

A boundless mountain range stood before them, and there were no trees on it. It was completely barren and extremely dark.

Yang Ye asked, “The Sword Ruins?”

She nodded, “Let’s go!”

They were about to go forward when sharp sounds suddenly resounded.

Yang Ye turned toward it, and a woman in a linen dress had appeared not too far away on his right. There were iron chains around her bare feet and hands. Besides that, there was a huge sword on her back.

The huge sword was much larger than her!

She was holding a broom in her grasp, and she was sweeping a tomb.

The woman in a red dress gazed at Yang Ye, “Deal with her!”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.
