Chapter 1791 – A Mysterious Person!

At this moment, when the experts of the other clans were combined with the experts of the Ying Clan, there were around 80 True Realm experts here!

But Yang Ye’s side only consisted of 11 experts.

The Ying Clan’s side had a crushing advantage in numbers.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye wiped off the blood on the corner of his mouth and gazed at Yang Ye, “We agreed that the one who seeks help is the other’s grandson. Come on, call me grandpa!”

Ying Yu’s face remained indifferent as he waved his right hand, “Kill them!”

Ying Qing and the others were about to attack when they heard this, but they suddenly looked towards the right. A woman in a red dress had appeared there, and she was walking slowly in their direction.

“What’s she doing here?” Yang Ye frowned when he saw her. Because she was the ancient cultivator in Moment Mountain.

The Ying Clan’s coalition clearly recognized her too, so their expressions immediately became solemn while vigilance filled their eyes.

She ignored them and walked over to Yang Ye, “Give me the wooden sword!”

In an instant, Yang Ye’s gaze turned icy cold!

She was here for the wooden sword!

Yang Ye remained silent for a moment and asked, “You’re going to Heaven Pillar Mountain too?”

She replied, “Of course!”

Yang Ye chuckled, “What? Not confident in yourself? You still need to use the wooden sword?”

The woman in a red dress stared at Yang Ye, “That’s my business. Are you going to hand it over, or shall I take it myself?”

The atmosphere here became tense when everyone heard her.

Ying Yu and the others took pleasure in Yang Ye’s misfortune. They hadn’t expected her to actually be here for Yang Ye, and that was absolutely good news for them.

Yang Ye gazed at her and smiled, “Come try and take it!”

She nodded, “Alright!”

As soon as she finished speaking, she raised her right hand and clawed at Yang Ye. Suddenly, a pitch black chain flashed at her like a bolt of lightning, and it was so swift that it only took an instant to arrive in front of her.

It was Nether Maiden!

The woman tapped a finger forward, and it tapped against the end of the chain.

Bang!

The chain shook violently and shot backwards.

Meanwhile, Nether Maiden appeared in front of her, and then Nether Maiden raised her hand slowly and spoke softly, “Reverse!”

A wave of mysterious energy instantly enveloped the woman in a red dress.

However, Nether Maiden’s expression changed while disbelief filled her eyes.

Meanwhile, the woman glanced at Nether Maiden, “Your ability isn’t bad. Unfortunately, there’s no vitality within me.”

She pressed her right palm down once she finished speaking.

Bang!

Nether Maiden was blasted over 1km away.

Meanwhile, the pig-riding young woman suddenly appeared in front of the woman in a red dress. A moment later, she grabbed her saber with both hands and swung it at the woman. However, a hand clamped down on the saber when it arrived just a few inches above the woman.

Bang!

A moment later, a wave of powerful energy surged through the saber and struck the pig-riding young woman, causing her to be blasted over 1km away. As soon as she stopped herself, a wisp of blood seeped out from the corner of her mouth, and her saber cracked open.

Meanwhile, the woman arrived in front of Yang Ye, and then her right hand shot at him. However, an invisible barrier suddenly appeared in front of Yang Ye.

The woman frowned slightly and shook her right hand.

Bang!

The space in a huge area trembled violently before a mouthful of blood sprayed from Boundary Maiden who was over 100m away, and then her figure moved backwards repeatedly.

Suddenly, the temperature around the woman dropped, and then the space around her froze her along with it. But it only took a moment for a ray of red light to suddenly sweep out of her.

Bang!

The ice in the surroundings were instantly blasted into bits, and then she turned around to gaze at Ice maiden, “Interesting. But you’re still too young!”

Ice Maiden glanced at the woman in a red dress, and then she waved her right hand. In an instant, snow covered the surroundings, and they were like fine blades that descended upon the woman in a red dress. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

The woman glanced at the snow, and then she flicked her finger. A thread of dark red blood flashed forward, and it instantly obliterated the snow around her. At the same time, the thread of blood arrived just a few inches before Ice Maiden’s forehead.

Suddenly, it stopped, and then it started to disintegrate. In just a short moment, it disintegrated into nothingness!

The woman in a red dress turned towards her right. Oblivion Maiden was standing there.

At this moment, Oblivion Maiden was holding tightly onto the fox in her arms while staring at the woman in a red dress. The space around the woman suddenly started to disintegrate under her gaze.

The experts of the Ying Clan’s coalition had shock all over their faces when they witnessed this.

Because it was such a mysterious ability!

The woman in a red dress gazed at Oblivion Maiden as well. She didn’t move away and just allowed the space around her to disintegrate. Just like that, three breaths of time passed, and the space around her had been disintegrated into spatial rifts.

However, she was completely unharmed!

Oblivion Maiden gazed at the woman for a long time, and then she gazed at Yang Ye and shrugged, “I’m no match for her.” She moved over 1km away after she finished speaking.

The woman glanced at Oblivion Maiden and didn’t attack again. Because her gaze had descended onto Yang Ye. But it didn’t take long for her to look at Zhuang Weiran, Yang Lianshuang, Light Maiden, and Shadow Maiden.

She asked, “Do all of you intend to give it a try too?”

“Of course!” Yang Lianshuang nodded slightly, and then her right hand transformed into a pitch black claw. A moment later, she appeared before the woman, and then her claw descended towards the top of the woman’s head.

Meanwhile, the woman in a red dress suddenly clenched her right fist and slammed it against Yang Lianshuang’s claw.

Bang!

Yang Lianshuang was blasted 300m away.

“The Undying Black Phoenix!” Meanwhile, the woman spoke abruptly, “Interesting. Unfortunately, not to mention you, even the Undying Black Phoenix was no match for me at my peak!”

As soon as she finished speaking, she tapped her right foot down and transformed into a blood red thread of light that shot at Yang Ye.

Meanwhile, Zhuang Weiran appeared in front of Yang Ye and was about to attack. However, Yang Ye pulled her behind him and flipped his palm. The wooden sword appeared in his grasp, and then he swung it!

It was an attack enhanced by two types of Enlightened Rank intents!

It was undoubtedly extremely strong because it wasn’t just enhanced by his dual intents, it was being executed with the wooden sword!

Bang!

A dazzling ray of blood red light suddenly erupted in front of Yang Ye, and then Yang Ye and Zhuang Weiran were blasted backwards repeatedly. They only stopped after moving around 300m back!

As for the woman in a red dress, she’d been pushed around 60m back!

She glanced at Yang Ye, “I didn’t expect your strength to be at this level. I’m truly surprised.”

Yang Ye wiped off the blood on the corner of his mouth and looked up at her, “I too didn’t expect your strength to have become much stronger.”

The woman started walking slowly in Yang Ye’s direction, “There are many more things that exceed your expectations. If I were you, I’d hand the sword over. Your current strength isn’t sufficient to keep it. If a person possesses something that doesn’t conform to that person’s strength, that person will die!”

“Hand it over to live?” Yang Ye chuckled, “My temper really doesn’t allow me to do that!”

She nodded, “I understand. Since that’s the case, I’ll come take it myself.”

As soon as she finished speaking, she appeared in front of Yang Ye. Suddenly, Yang Ye vanished on the spot, and he was behind her when he appeared again. However, a wave of powerful energy immediately blasted him 300m away.

Yang Ye hadn’t even stopped himself when she appeared abruptly before him, and Yang Ye didn’t hesitate to swing his sword in response.

Space was instantly sliced apart before his sword, but it hit nothing.

An instant later, a palm slapped against Yang Ye’s back.

Boom!

It blasted Yang Ye over 1km away. But as soon as he stopped himself, she appeared in front of him again. However, Yang Lianshuang, Zhuang Weiran, and the others appeared in front of Yang Ye as well.

The woman in a red dress didn’t attack. She glanced at them and said, “Why don’t all of you fight me together?”

Ying Yu and the others were overjoyed by this. Because they didn’t have to do anything and Yang Ye may die. Even if Yang Ye didn’t die, it was fine because they could take advantage of the situation!

Now, they didn’t have to do anything, and they just had to watch!

Meanwhile, the woman in a red dress said, “Come on! Attack me!”

“You’re really confident!” Suddenly, a mysterious voice resounded, “But isn’t it meaningless to bully juniors? Allow me to experience your extraordinary ability!”
