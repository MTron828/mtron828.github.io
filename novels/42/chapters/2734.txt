Chapter 2735 – Slaughtering Sprites!

Time flashed by. A month passed in the blink of an eye.𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Of course, according to the time in the cultivation room, it hadn’t been a month but almost a year!

The world thought that Yang Ye was an extraordinary genius, a peerless one even, but that was actually not the case. He’d actually been cultivating for a long time. If the time he spent in the Primordial Pagoda was included, it would be at least around 200 years.

But An Nanjing was a true genius because she hadn’t cultivated in the Primordial Pagoda for long.

Yang Ye had always admitted that his talent was inferior to An Nanjing.

However, he didn’t lose to her when it came to hard work.

He’d been just a labor disciple, and he’d relied on endless hard work to climb all the way here.

When he thought about the past, Yang Ye was very well aware that hard work was more important than talent.

Of course, luck was even more important.

Sometimes, working hard your entire life may be incomparable to what some are born with. A good birth was the best!

Yang Ye shook his head and smiled when he thought of this.

Actually, he’d had quite a good birth as well. His father had been a true extraordinary figure in that world. As for luck, his luck had been good because while he’d had a rough path, he’d had numerous fortuitous encounters!

Birth, fortune, hard work, and luck. Actually, all of them were important.

Yang Ye closed his eyes slowly.

When the mind was clear, the Sword Dao could be too.

The sword would be pure when the Sword Heart was flawless; and the sword would only be invincible when the Sword Heart was free!

The sharp sword intent Yang Ye emanated gradually underwent some sort of transformation.

Sword cultivators cultivated in the sword, then the heart.

Yang Ye’s sword was almost at its peak, but his heart had some ways to go.

On the Ascension Platform.

Snowy was busy hammering something. She’d done that for every one of the swords that Yang Ye was still using!

Including the swords that belonged to Destiny!

Among the treasures Yang Ye possessed, the swords of Destiny were definitely the most rebellious. However, they were very obedient and did not dare to resist Snowy!

Because they’d witnessed what had happened to Heaven Executor.

Hadn’t Heaven Executor been insufferably arrogant and powerful in the past? It even tried to kill Yang Ye and Snowy, but what happened in the end? Snowy eliminated its sprite!

The sprite had been cultivating for countless years, and it had absorbed so much spirit energy from the Martial Sky World in order to foster such a unique sprite, and it even received Heaven Executor’s acknowledgment to become its sprite. It could be said that it had been very, very lucky.

However, it chose someone it shouldn’t have, and it tried to kill Yang Ye and Snowy!

Even though Snowy was mischievous, she had a very good temper. If Heaven Executor had admitted its mistakes upon being captured, Snowy was very likely to spare it. Unfortunately, it hadn’t.

So, the outcome was obvious. The sword remained but the sprite was gone!

Now that they had Heaven Executor as an example, Past Life and Great Unknown had no intent to resist Snowy. As for the five element swords, they were even more obedient. Because if they were to try and resist, Snowy would tell Destiny’s swords to suppress them… And it just so happens that they were slightly inferior to those three swords. That was the thing they were most helpless about.

In short, Snowy was the leader of these divine treasures!

Perhaps they would dare to resist Yang Ye, but they would absolutely not dare to resist Snowy.

Actually, there was another reason why they didn’t resist. It was that they had improved tremendously after Snowy’s random work on them!

Suddenly, Erya arrived on the Ascension Platform.

Snowy glanced at her and cracked a smile.

Erya glanced at the swords in front of Snowy, and then she casually grabbed Heaven Executor. The latter trembled slightly and resisted her slightly.

Erya frowned.

The swords didn’t know Erya very well because she’d been absorbing the inner core fragment while they joined Yang Ye.

Erya glanced at Heaven Executor and spoke indifferently, “Quiet down!”

Not only did it refuse to quiet down, it shook even more violently.

Obviously, it had a temper of its own!

Not just anyone could control it.

Erya frowned again and grabbed Heaven Executor with both hands, and then she pulled down. In an instant, Heaven Executor was bent!

A sword howl suddenly resounded from it!

Meanwhile, Erya released the sword, and it stabbed at her head. However, it was blasted away instead!

Snowy blinked and gazed at her head.

It’s so hard?

Erya patted her own forehead. It wasn’t very painful, but it was slightly itchy!

A sword was still a sword, and its strength was very limited without someone to control it!

Erya glanced at Heaven Executor, gazed at Snowy, and said, “Come help me! I need lots of spirit energy.”

Snowy tossed the sword aside and flew over to her shoulder, and then she curiously touched Erya’s horns!

Dark gold horns!

Erya slightly stiffened when Snowy touched them, but it only took a moment for her to return to normal.

Erya led Snowy to where she’d been cultivating. She sat down there and gazed at Snowy. The latter understood what she meant and immediately released countless strands of spirit energy.

She clearly needed a lot of spirit energy. Otherwise, she wouldn’t have brought Snowy here as she could have just absorbed the spirit energy within the Primordial Pagoda. If she needed too much and just absorbed it from this world, it was very likely to make the world collapse! So, she’d sought Snowy’s help!

…

Eternal Kingdom.

Central Prefecture. A large hall.

Huang Ying sat at the seat of the host, and Huang Buer, Huang Xuan, and the undying race’s patriarch were by his side.

There were around 30 people below, and they were the experts from all over the universe.

From the moment the desolate race broke its way into the Eternal Kingdom, countless stopped watching and rushed over. Even ancient clans that had been staying in seclusion had started to reveal themselves as they wanted a share of the spoils!

Because showing themselves now carried no risk.

In the past, they wouldn’t have dared to pick sides, especially when the desolate race had lost the Desolate Emperor! Yet now, the outcome had been decided.

Huang Ying remained indifferent as he sat there in the hall.

No one spoke.

A long time passed before Huang Ying gazed at the black robed figure down below, “You want the divine vein of Eternal Kingdom?”

The black robed figure replied, “Yes, it’s my Lord’s request.”

Huang Ying spoke solemnly, “Eternal Kingdom will cease to be Eternal Kingdom once that divine vein is gone.”

The black robed figure replied indifferently, “That is not our problem. You just have to say if you’ll do it or not!”

Huang Ying’s eyes narrowed slightly. They were trying to threaten him!

The temperature here turned icy cold.

The black robed figure had its hands crossed in front of it, and the figure remained silent and very calm.

A long time passed before Huang Ying moved his gaze away, “Can’t we discuss this? Conquering Eternal Kingdom would become meaningless once that divine vein is lost. You…”

The black robed figure suddenly interrupted Huang Ying, “So you refuse, right?”

Huang Ying spoke solemnly, “Looks like negotiations are impossible, right?”

The black robed figure chuckled, “Do you think you could have conquered Eternal Kingdom without our help? Stop being naïve, and don’t overestimate yourself. Allow me to be honest, my Lord is determined to obtain that divine vein. Of course, we hope you’ll be obedient and give it up to us, then it’ll end well for everyone.”

Huang Yin fell silent.

Huang Buer suddenly said, “Your help was indispensable in our effort to take Eternal Kingdom, but we all yearn for Eternal Kingdom because of the divine vein. Yet now, you want to take it, and so entering Eternal Kingdom is meaningless to us. Or to be more frank, we don’t want to just give it up for free.”

The black robed figure shook its head slightly, “Then there’s no need to discuss it further.”

Three ethereal figures suddenly appeared behind the black robed figure. Besides that, over a dozen figures within the hall walked over to stand behind him.

Huang Ying and the others’ expressions instantly turned gloomy from the sight of this!

The black robed man said, “Huang Ying, you’re being very insensible. Allow me to be honest, if the Desolate Emperor was still alive, we may be slightly fearful, yet now, your desolate race has no right to negotiate with us.”

He vanished on the spot.

Huang Ying’s expression changed drastically. Meanwhile, Huang Buer suddenly appeared before him and swung a punch forward. At the exact same instant, a fist slammed against his chest!

Boom!

In an instant, the entire hall exploded apart and was obliterated.

The dust and dirt dispersed, and Huang Buer was over 10km away. His chest had sunken down, and blood was seeping out incessantly from the corner of his mouth!

Huang Buer had a solemn expression on his face!

This fellow before him had been concealing his strength!

Along with Huang Buer being pushed back, the surroundings fell silent.

In this world, the strong were respected, and the strong had the right to decide things!

After he punched Huang Buer away, the black robed man gazed at Huang Ying. The latter had a calm expression on his face and wasn’t panicking at all, and he revealed no fear or anxiousness!

The black robed man smiled, “Not bad, you can stay calm before danger.”

Huang Ying spoke indifferently, “If you want to take the divine vein, my desolate race cannot stop you, but you seem to have forgotten something!”

The black robed man asked, “What?”

Huang Ying smiled, “It is a type of sprite, and Yang Ye once said that sprites should not be harmed. If you take it, aren’t you afraid that he’ll come for you?”

The black robed man chuckled, “Yang Ye? How laughable. You may be afraid of him, but that doesn’t mean we do too. We’re taking Eternal Kingdom’s divine vein today, and we’re not stopping with the divine vein, we’re going to take all the sprites in Eternal Kingdom. Let me see what Yang Ye can do about it.”

As he spoke, he turned around and walked to the side, “Tell them to activate the formation we set up around the place. If they dare to refuse, the desolate race will be no more from today onward!”

He vanished into the distance once he finished speaking.

The surroundings fell extremely silent!

A short while passed before Huang Ying suddenly said, “Immediately contact Yang Ye! Tell him someone plans to slaughter sprites!”
