Chapter 2525 – Three Years!

At the Ascension Platform. The demon beasts were gathered here!

At this moment, all of them were at the Five World Realm!

The Five World Realm was at a completely different level when compared to the Four World Realm. It could be said that Yang Ye possessed a powerful army right now!

Yang Ye glanced at them and said, “While you’re at the Five World Realm, you can’t slack off on your training. Erya isn’t here, so you’re the strongest here, Dragon. You must lead them to train and temper themselves at the lightning pool. If anyone slacks off or is unwilling, I’m sure you know what to do, right?”

The dragon hurriedly nodded because he naturally knew what to do!

After telling them a bunch of things, Yang Ye left the Primordial Pagoda.

The Ancient Sword Sect!

He planned to go around it!

He’d planned to leave once he obtained Sword Scroll’s main body, but he had to stay now!

Yang Ye went to the rear mountains of the Ancient Sword Sect, and there was a huge waterfall there. Water surged down from it and entered the pool below, causing huge and magnificent waves to arise.

Yang Ye walked to the bottom of the waterfall. Suddenly, the Sword Gourd trembled slightly, and then a ray of light flashed.

Hiss!

The waterfall was instantly sliced into two!

He’d broken the waterfall’s flow with a single attack!

His attacks were very, very fast right now!

“That’s very fast!” A voice suddenly came from behind Yang Ye.

Yang Ye turned around and saw the Grand Elder.

Yang Ye bowed slightly, “Grand Elder!”

The Grand Elder nodded slightly, “You’ve been to the Sword Cave.”

Yang Ye nodded.

The Grand Elder walked over to Yang Ye and said, “I heard you want the fragments in that pillar of light?”

Yang Ye nodded again.

The Grand Elder looked Yang Ye in the eyes, “Do you know what they are?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “I don’t. But I can sense that it isn’t ordinary.”

The Grand Elder gazed at Yang Ye in silence.

Yang Ye smiled, “Is there a problem?”

The Grand Elder replied, “It’s a precious treasure of the sect.”

Yang Ye smiled, “You said I could go inside and search for my own fortune!”

The Grand Elder replied indifferently, “Only the Sect Master or Junior Sect Master can obtain those fragments.”

Yang Ye gazed at the Grand Elder, “You’ve been wary of me since the beginning. Or I should say that the Ancient Sword Sect has kept its guard up against me since the beginning. So, no matter what I do, the Ancient Sword Sect is always watching, right?”

The Grand Elder nodded. He was very frank about it!

Yang Ye grinned, “Grand Elder, then why did you make me stay?”

The Grand Elder walked to the side and gazed at the waterfall as he spoke softly, “Ye Yang, I’m sure you’re aware that we can’t refuse you. Because you’re truly monstrous, and we need someone like you in our younger generation. But we’ve been wary of you, and I won’t hide that from you.”

He turned around to look at Yang Ye, “Why are you here in the Ancient Sword Sect?”

Obviously, the Grand Elder wanted to be direct with Yang Ye.

Yang Ye walked over to the Grand Elder and patted the Sword Gourd, three swords floated before him. Besides that, he withdrew two seals and the Myriad World Diagram.

All of them were Divine Treasures!

Yang Ye gazed at the Grand Elder, “Grand Elder, I’m sure you’ve realized that I have no need for Divine Treasures, nor do I need sword techniques.”

The Grand Elder nodded slightly, “I know. So, that’s why we’re wondering what you want!”

Yang Ye smiled, “If I said I wanted to overthrow the Ancient Sword Sect, would you believe me?”

The Grand Elder shook his head slightly, “That’s probably not your goal. I can sense that you hold no hostility to the sect.”

Yang Ye walked over to the waterfall, “Grand Elder, you should have sensed my Sword Dao and my heart toward the sword. I will never do anything that goes against my heart. I do have some small reasons for coming here, but I guarantee that I have no ill intent toward the Ancient Sword Sect.”

No ill intent to the Ancient Sword Sect!

The Grand Elder took a deep and long glance at Yang Ye, and then he said, “Then what do you want?”

Yang Ye smiled and didn’t say anything.

He would try his best to help Sword Scroll, but he couldn’t do anything if it was impossible.

As for taking it by force, that would definitely not work because he was no match for the Ancient Sword Sect!

The Grand Elder didn’t ask his question again.

Suddenly, Yang Ye said, “I want the fragments in that pillar of light!”

The Grand Elder’s eyes narrowed slightly.

Yang Ye gazed at the Grand Elder, “Can I have it?”

The Grand Elder asked, “Is that your true objective?”

Yang Ye nodded, “It is!”

The Grand Elder gazed at Yang Ye for a long time and asked, “You know what those fragments are, right?”

Yang Ye nodded, “I do.”

The Grand Elder asked, “Who are you?!”

Yang Ye smiled, “Ye Yang. As for why I know about those fragments, it’s because of a fortuitous encounter!”

He’d chosen to just be frank with them in the end. Otherwise, if the Ancient Sword Sect stayed wary of him, he would never have a chance to obtain those fragments!

So, instead of doing that, it was better to be frank!

The Grand Elder fell silent for a long time and said, “I’ll give you an answer in a day, alright?”

Yang Ye nodded.

The Grand Elder turned around and left!

Yang Ye gazed at the waterfall and fell into deep thought.

After he arrived at the Eternal Kingdom, he noticed that Eternal Kingdom wasn’t that bad. Or it should be said that every place had good people and bad people. However, if Eternal Kingdom went to war with the desolate race, both the good and bad would die!

As for the Ancient Sword Sect, it would probably lose countless sword cultivators, and even Mo Ya and the others may die!

Yang Ye laughed with self-ridicule because he was actually worrying about things like that.

Yang Ye shook his head and left. He returned to his room and entered the Primordial Pagoda.

Cultivate!

As far as he was concerned, he should use all the time he had to cultivate.

Especially Eternal Light, he still wasn’t able to fully utilize it, or it should be said that he couldn’t bring out its full potential.

In the clouds, Yang Ye had his eyes closed as he activated the Sword Domain. With the Sword Domain’s help, he could clearly sense everything in a huge area around him. Even the slightest movement of an ant couldn’t escape him.𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Suddenly, Eternal Light shot out of the Sword Gourd.

So long as Yang Ye wanted it, this sword would appear anywhere in 500 km around him!

How fast was that?

If he used the Sword Domain, he was 90% confident in being able to use just Eternal Light to soundlessly annihilate a Five World Realm expert in an instant. Of course, the precondition was that his target wasn’t prepared! If a Five World Realm expert did everything possible to protect themselves, it was extremely difficult to instantly kill them!

One day later, a young sword cultivator arrived at Yang Ye’s abode.

The young man bowed slightly to Yang Ye and said, “Senior Brother Ye, the Grand Elder has summoned you!”

Yang Ye nodded slightly, “Please lead the way!”

The young man bowed once more and led the way.

The Meeting Hall.

The young man led Yang Ye to the meeting hall and left. Yang Ye walked in, and he saw the Grand Elder and a beautiful woman within the hall.

Grand Elder introduced the woman, “This is Elder Xue! The number one expert of our sect besides the sect master.”

Yang Ye glanced at her and bowed slightly, “Elder Xue!”

Elder Xue nodded slightly and walked over to Yang Ye, “You’re here in our sect for those fragments?”

Yang Ye nodded.

Elder Xue said, “I’m sure you know what those fragments are, it’s a Super Divine Treasure.”

Yang Ye smiled, “No matter how precious it is, it’s still just a Divine Treasure.”

Elder Xue grinned, “That is true. I’ll be frank with you. I’m sure you want that destroyed Super Divine Treasure for a reason, and I won’t ask why. However, it belongs to the Ancient Sword Sect, right?”

Yang Ye nodded, “I’m a disciple of the Ancient Sword Sect right now!”

Elder Xue looked him in the eyes, “If you really were, then not to mention a destroyed Super Divine Treasure, we would even be willing to give you a Super Divine Treasure that’s whole! Unfortunately, you aren’t, right?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “Senior, just be frank.”

Elder Xue smiled, “Alright, then I’ll be frank. We have some worries, worries that you’ll leave upon obtaining those fragments. At that time, we would lose both that treasure and you! Moreover, we may even become the laughingstock of the world. Do you think our worries are warranted?”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and nodded, “Yes!”

Elder Xue continued, “If you want those fragments, you must become our Junior Sect Master and you must do so sincerely. Can you?”

Yang Ye fell silent for a short moment and said, “Three years, I can only stay here for three years at most!”

Elder Xue asked, “Why?”

Yang Ye looked Elder Xue in the eyes, “There’ll be no place for me here in three years!”

Both the Grand Elder and Elder Xue were stunned.

A moment later, Elder Xue roared with laughter, and a while passed before she shook her head, “You’re really confident! Or I should say, conceited!”

Yang Ye replied indifferently, “If I’m being honest, it may not even take three years!”

Elder Xue restrained her smile and looked him in the eye, “Why do you say that?”

Yang Ye shook his head slightly and looked to the right. An old man was standing in the corner, and he was a peak Five World Realm expert.

As soon as Yang Ye gazed at the old man, the Grand Elder instantly had an extremely vigilant expression on his face. A moment later, two flying swords shot out of Yang Ye’s Sword Gourd, and they were so fast that the Grand Elder and Elder Xue were visibly moved.

The old man reacted very quickly. At the instant the flying swords shot at him, two rays of light shot out and blocked Yang Ye’s flying swords.

However, the old man’s figure stiffened at the exact same moment.

It was because an invisible sword had pressed against his chest!

The Grand Elder and Elder Xue’s expressions instantly became solemn at the sight of this.

Yang Ye issued a command in his heart, and Eternal Light and the other swords flew back into the Sword Gourd.

Yang Ye gazed at Elder Xue, “In these three years that I’m here, the younger generation of the Ancient Sword Sect can keep their heads held up to the sky!”
