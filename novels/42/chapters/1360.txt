Chapter 1361 – I Asked, So Tell Me. Understand?

There was a middle aged man by the woman’s side. The middle aged man’s countenance was ghastly pale while his eyes were deathly still. There was a golden rope coiled around him, and it ceaselessly emanated faint golden threads of light that bound him.

Yang Ye was shocked because he recognized the middle aged man!

It was none other than Fen Cangyan who’d come to the Radiant Dimension that day to get Lady!

What’s he doing here? How did he become a slave? Yang Ye’s brows were knit tightly together while bewilderment filled his eyes.

Has something happened to her? Yang Ye’s pupils constricted slightly at the thought of this, and he slowly clenched his fists. At the same time, a strand of panic crept out from the bottom of his heart.

Ye Liuyun noticed Yang Ye’s unusual reaction and asked, “You recognize him?”

Yang Ye took a deep breath and said, “Get him!”

Ye Liuyun glanced at Yang Ye, and then she turned to look at the stone platform.

The woman in a green dress glanced at the surroundings and smiled, “Everyone, his background isn’t normal at all. He’s from Clouds of Heaven Stellar Region. I presume all of you’ve heard of it. It’s at war with the Celestial Demon Stellar Region. However, it’s in quite a bad situation right now.”

She smiled sweetly and continued, “I’ve gone off-topic. Let’s get back to the main point. I’m sure you’ve all heard of the Wargod Clan in Clouds of Heaven Stellar Region. He’s from that clan. Moreover, his status is quite high. He’s one of the 4 Hall Masters of the Wargod Clan, the Heavenly Flame Hall’s master, Fen Cangyan. His strength is at the True Voider Realm, and 2 strands of his soul are in our possession. So, if you’re interested in bidding for him, you can rest at ease. There’s no need to fear that he will flee or betray you! The starting price is 100 divine crystals!”

Suddenly, a voice resounded, “Miss Tingyu, will the Wargod Clan look for trouble with us if we buy him?”

The woman in a green dress who was called Tingyu glanced in the direction of the voice and said, “That’s your own business. We’re only in charge of the sales. Right, allow me to say that Clouds of Heaven Stellar Region may not exist soon. Because according to the information I obtained, Clouds of Heaven Stellar Region is being pushed back repeatedly in their battle with the Celestial Demon Stellar Region. If it received no help from outsiders, then I’m certain it won’t take more than 2 years for the Wargod Clan to be wiped out from this world.”

A voice suddenly resounded, “Why?”

It was Yang Ye who’d asked.

Tingyu glanced at Yang Ye and Ye Liuyun’s direction, and then she withdrew her gaze and said, “The starting bid is 100 divine crystals. Let’s begin!”

She ignored me! Yang Ye rubbed his nose and felt rather embarrassed. However, his skin was quite thick, so it only took a moment for him to recover from it and gaze at Ye Liuyun.

Ye Liuyun said, “I noticed something when we entered, and it’s that the position of these rooms is different. For example, look over there!” As she spoke, she pointed at a room that was 300m away from them. That room was covered by a formation as well, but there was a small word on the barrier of light created by the formation — VIP.

Ye Liuyun said, “Understand?”

Yang Ye nodded. Simply speaking, They were amongst the general public, so they had no status and had been ignored. He naturally wouldn’t make a fuss about it. Even though he felt quite a bit of aversion towards people who looked down on others, the world was just that realistic. If one didn’t possess strength, then not to mention others, even the people closest to them might look down on them.

Meanwhile, the bidding for Fen Cangyan had gone up to 1,000 divine crystals or 100,000 violet crystals. Such an amount was definitely an astronomical figure to ordinary cultivators, but it was probably just change to the people here. No, it might not even be change to them.

The gap between the rich and poor was unimaginable.

Meanwhile, Ye Liuyun suddenly asked, “Are you determined to get him?”

Yang Ye nodded. Even though he didn’t know why Fen Cangyan had fallen to such a state, he was Lady’s subordinate. So, since he’d seen Fen Cangyan in such a state, he naturally had to lend a hand.

Ye Liuyun nodded, and then she gazed at the stone platform and said, “3,000 divine crystals!”

Tingyu was shocked when she heard this, and she turned to look in Yang Ye and Ye Liuyun’s direction.

Yang Ye gazed at her with quite a bit of surprise as well. Because she’d instantly increased the bid from 1,000 to 3,000 divine crystals. That was equivalent to 300,000 violet crystals! However, it didn’t take long for Yang Ye to understand the reason. Even though it was quite a large number, a true Voider was worth that price.

“3,500!” Suddenly, a voice resounded.

A smile instantly curled up on the corners of Tingyu’s mouth. If people competed for the item, then the price would grow higher and higher. The higher it got, the more her commission would be.

Suddenly, a voice resounded, “5,000!”

It was Ye Liuyun.

The corners of Yang Ye’s eyes couldn’t help but twitch when he heard her bid 5,000 divine crystals. After all, that was almost half of everything he had.

That isn’t how you spend money.... Yang Ye’s heart felt like it was bleeding, but he didn’t stop her.

Ye Liuyun’s wealth had clearly shocked the other bidder. So, after Tingyu asked 3 times in succession yet no one made another bid, Fen Cangyan was sold to Yang Ye.

Ye Liuyun gazed at Yang Ye and smiled, “Does it hurt?”

Yang Ye told the truth, “Slightly.”

Ye Liuyun said, “You were determined to get him, so I had no other choice. Otherwise, if anything unexpected occurs, then the price might go even higher. Even though we spend a little more, it’s safer.”

Yang Ye nodded, “I understand.”

Meanwhile, Ye Liuyun suddenly said, “How many violet crystals do you have?”

Yang Ye replied, “Around a little over a million. Why?”

Ye Liuyun shot him a strange gaze, “I really can’t figure out how you earned so many violet crystals. It’s almost comparable to half a month of the Sword Alliance’s income.”

Yang Ye smiled. Suddenly, his eyes opened wide, “Half a month of the Sword Alliance’s income? The Sword Alliance earns that much in half a month?”

Ye Liuyun blinked, “What? You didn’t know? Right, I seem to have forgotten to tell you.”

Yang Ye felt speechless.

Ye Liuyun smiled, “Do you know how many violet crystals the Sword Alliance earns every day from the city’s entrance fees and residency fees? You’re definitely unable to imagine the amount. Just the entrance fees bring in almost 300,000 violet crystals every month. Besides that, the other fees collected in the city like the land rented out to others and the residency fees to remain in the city brings in around 3,000,000 violet crystals every month. Of course, a huge amount of that has to be used to maintain the normal operations of the city. However, the remaining violet crystals are still a huge amount!”

Yang Ye asked, “You brought Violet Crystals with you when you came, right?”

Ye Liuyun nodded. Yang Ye hurriedly asked, “How many?”

She replied, “3 million.”

3 million! Yang Ye’s face was covered in shock. Because 3 million violet crystals were equivalent to 30,000 divine crystals!

Ye Liuyun rolled her eyes at Yang Ye and said, “You look like they don’t belong to you.”

Yang Ye laughed bitterly, “Liuyun, I suddenly feel quite worried. I’m worried that you might betray me one day, and the Sword Alliance’s treasury will definitely be completely emptied out by you.”

The authority he’d give her was truly too great. It was so great that she practically held the greatest amount of authority beneath him. Even the Blade group he’d created would give her face. Because as far as the others were concerned, she was the subordinary that he trusted the most. It was even to the extent that many felt that Ye Liuyun’s decisions were actually Yang Ye’s decisions.

If Ye Liuyun betrayed him, then the Sword Alliance would definitely collapse. After all, many had been fostered by her to their current positions or attainments in their cultivation. Besides that, she practically knew everything about the Sword Alliance, and she even knew it better than him, the actual master of the Sword Alliance.

Ye Liuyun glanced at Yang Ye and spoke softly, “Are you afraid?”

Yang Ye shook his head and smiled, “So long as I’m alive, you’ll never betray me, nor would you dare to do so. Right?”

Ye Liuyun gazed at him for a long time and chuckled, “Confident men are always the most charming.”

“The slave you purchased is here.”

Yang Ye was about to speak when a voice suddenly resounded from outside.

Ye Liuyun said, “Come in!”

As soon as she finished speaking, a man in black armor led Fen Cangyan into the room. Fen Cangyan’s eyes instantly opened wide upon laying eyes on Yang Ye, “You... You.... How could it possibly be you?”

He naturally recognized Yang Ye. After all, he’d objected when Lady gave her ring to Yang Ye. Moreover, he’d even aroused killing intent towards Yang Ye, but Lady had stopped him. He hadn’t expected to meet Yang Ye here and under such circumstances.

Meanwhile, the man in black armor asked, “Both of you know each other?”

Ye Liuyun flicked a spatial ring over to the man. The man took it, and then sent a ball of energy over to Ye Liuyun. There were 2 thumb-sized strands of brown gas within it. It was the strands of Fen Cangyan’s soul. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Once Ye Liuyun received the ball of energy, the man cupped his fist towards Yang Ye and Ye Liuyun before waving his hand. He reclaimed the rope that bound Fen Cangyan, and then he left.

Fen Cangyan glanced at Yang Ye and said, “Thank you!”

Yang Ye shook his head and said, “It was nothing. Tell me how she is.”

Fen Cangyan hesitated for a moment and said, “Allow me to be honest. It’s best if you don’t interfere in my Young Miss’s business....”

Suddenly, Yang Ye vanished on the spot. Fen Cangyan’s expression changed drastically when he saw Yang Ye’s figure vanish, and he was about to counterattack. However, a strand of terrifying pressure suddenly pressed down upon him, and then a sword was pressed against the center of his forehead.

Yang Ye gazed coldly at Fen Cangyan who was completely stunned on the spot, and he said, “I asked, so tell me. Understand?”
