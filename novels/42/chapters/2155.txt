Chapter 2156 – Heaven Spirit Formation!

Am I weak? He asked himself that question, and he felt that he wasn’t weak. This person before him would not belittle him intentionally, so there was only one reason for that.

He wasn’t weak, it was the person before him who was too strong!

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts and looked at the figure, “Am I very weak?”

“Not that weak!” The voice continued, “I can sense that your aura is quite interesting!”

Yang Ye felt speechless.

The voice assed, “Is it the End Times now?”

Yang Ye didn’t want to continue discussing whether he was weak either, so he nodded, “It hasn’t really begun, but it probably won’t be long.”

The voice fell silent for a long time and said, “It still came in the end!”

Yang Ye asked, “Senior, you knew that the End Times would come now?”

“Yes!” The voice continued, “My race predicted its arrival all those years ago.”

The voice paused for a moment and continued, “Human, are you weak or strong among the humans?”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and replied, “I’m not the strongest!”

“I understand!” The voice said, “It seems like all of you won’t be able to overcome this calamity then.”

Yang Ye gazed at the figure, “All of you were able to escape the End Times all those years ago?”

“Yes!” The voice continued, “We predicted its arrival before it even arrived. So, we started to look for a way out. In the end, we relied on the Eye of Heaven to travel through the universe and find a new place to live in the boundless universe. Perhaps it was a blessing from the heavens, but we succeeded. However, only the strongest experts of my race were able to head over there!”

Yang Ye asked, “So you created that formation?”

The voice replied, “Yes, we used the strength of our entire race and the large universe as its core to create a super teleportation formation. It allowed us to be teleported away.”

Yang Ye asked, “Can we use that teleportation formation?”

The voice fell silent for a moment and replied, “In theory, yes. However, your overall strength is too weak, so I think that you probably won’t be able to activate the formation. Moreover, you may even suffer backlash from it.”

Yang Ye asked without thinking, “Then what do we do?”

Yang Ye’s question took the figure by surprise. What do they do? What did that have to do with the figure…

Yang Ye had realized that too, and he smiled embarrassedly and said, “Senior, do you know about the Star Gate?”

The voice had a trace of bewilderment in it, “The Star Gate?”

Yang Ye nodded, “A gate that can teleport people to other universes!”

“I know what you’re talking about.” The voice continued, “That is no Star Gate, that’s the Door of Death.”

“The Door of Death?” Yang Ye frowned, “What do you mean?”

The voice replied, “It’s a teleportation gate made by the “undying race”. It will teleport people to the Undying System. Do you know why they are called the undying race? Because they can’t die, to a certain extent.”

“They can’t die?” Yang Ye said, “That’s impossible!”

The figure said, “They don’t fully deserve the name of undying. They need an endless supply of lives from other living beings, and use that to keep themselves alive. So, they created that Star Gate and projected it throughout the universe. Someone from my race entered it without knowing what it was, and he wouldn’t have been able to return if he hadn’t been strong enough!”

The Door of Death!

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly. He’d thought of how the prehistoric race had been teleported over through the Star Gate. If this figure wasn’t lying, then the prehistoric expert had been lying to him.

The large universe was clearly not the undying race’s territory!

But why would that prehistoric expert lie to him? What reason did that prehistoric expert have? Or perhaps he’d made a mistake somewhere?

Or perhaps this figure before him was deceiving him?

But why?

Yang Ye was puzzled!

“My race fought the undying race all those years ago!” Suddenly, the figure added, “They are extremely strong, but we didn’t go to full-scale war in the end.”

The figure fell silent at this point and added, “Human, my race left my consciousness here to let me take a look at the large universe’s future. Now, as soon as you entered this hall and activate this formation, awakening me has allowed me to see the large universe. So, it’s time for me to leave. If you have anything you still don’t understand, you can ask me now!”

Yang Ye nodded and said, “Senior, is there really no other way for us to leave this universe?” Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

“Activate the Heaven Spirit Formation!” The figure continued, “Converge the strength of the entire universe and activate it, and then teleport yourselves to the universe we once went to. While the spirit energy there is slightly scarcer now, the End Times is still some time away. So, you can live there temporarily. As for the Star Gate, don’t go looking for it. Once you enter it with your strength, you’ll probably never return.”

The Heaven Spirit Formation!

Yang Ye laughed bitterly, “Senior, you may not be aware of this but all the organizations in this large universe have enmity with each other, so it’s probably impossible to make them all work together. Moreover, they won’t believe me!”

The figure said, “If you still don’t unite at a time like this, then you deserve death.”

“Fine!” Yang Ye laughed bitterly, and then he hesitated slightly before he said, “Senior, do you have any treasures? I mean treasures you don’t need or any treasures you left behind in this universe. Please let me know if you do. Right, I’ll keep it safe for you, and I’ll return it to you in the future, if possible. Alright?”

The figure felt speechless.

This was an opportunity, an opportunity to get treasures. As for his face, he put it aside for now!

A short while passed before the figure said, “Now that you mentioned it, there is a place. You can try your luck there!”

Yang Ye’s eyes lit up, “Where?”

The figure said, “There’s a planet called Initial Spirit Star in the large universe. Or you can call it Initial Spirit Continent. It’s the continent we used to live on. However, the spirit energy there should have dried up completely by now. For the sake of completing the Heaven Spirit Formation, we extracted all the spirit energy from Initial Spirit Continent, causing its foundation to be damaged and impossible to restore. However, we left in a hurry, so we weren’t able to take some things with us. Moreover, some experts of my race may have left things there too. You can go there and try your luck!”

Initial Spirit Star!

Yang Ye was delighted. Actually, he’d gained enough on this trip. Because he’d gained a lot of information, and it was extremely important to him!

It didn’t take long for the figure to vanish. Yang Ye was about to leave when Snowy suddenly emerged from the pagoda. She pointed at the palace and blinked!

The palace!

Yang Ye’s eyes lit up, and he glanced at the surroundings. At this moment, he realized that the palace wasn’t ordinary at all. He hesitated for a moment and swung his sword. A ray of sword energy slammed against its walls, but his sword energy hadn’t been able to blast it into bits. It had merely made a mark on the wall!

It’s so strong! Yang Ye was quite shocked. While he hadn’t used his full strength, it was sufficient to prove how strong the palace was!

After attacking it two more times, Yang Ye still couldn’t damage it. Moreover, the marks he made had been fully repaired!

A treasure!

A great treasure!

Yang Ye and Snowy’s eyes lit up. Especially Yang Ye. According to his estimations, even ten Sages couldn’t destroy this palace.

Yang Ye and Snowy exchanged glances. In the end, Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings and said, “Uh, Senior, if you don’t mind, I’ll be taking this palace. Right, I’ll keep it safe for you, and I’ll return it when we meet. Don’t worry, I always keep my world.”

He received no reply!

Yang Ye said, “Uh, silence is acceptance. Right, I’ll be taking it now!”

Yang Ye waved his right hand and transported it into the Primordial Pagoda, and then he took Snowy in his arms and left without casting another glance backward.

He’d left very quickly!

Not long after Yang Ye left, a voice muttered, “Are all humans so shameless?”

…

Yang Ye left the endless black holes with Snowy. He was just about to speak to the Dao Progenitor, but he noticed that he couldn’t contact the Dao Progenitor.

Yang Ye frowned, “What’s going on?”

Something was off!

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment, and then he vanished on the spot.

Yang Ye entered the starry sky of the large universe, but it didn’t take long for him to stop. He patted Snowy and said, “Go inside!”

Snowy rubbed her head against Yang Ye’s chin, and then she obediently entered the Primordial Pagoda.

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings, “Show yourself!”

As soon as he finished speaking, 20 people appeared around Yang Ye. All of them were Sages!

20 Sages!

It was none other than the Sovereign of Sky who was leading the group.

There were 21 Sages here if the Sovereign of Sky was included. Moreover, Yang Ye could sense a formation here. It had locked down a huge area of outer space. Besides that, a strand of mysterious energy had locked onto him!

The Dao Progenitor wasn’t here!

Obviously, the Dao Progenitor was being kept occupied!

Another progenitor had taken action!

In an instant, Yang Ye figured out a lot of things!

They wanted to annihilate him!

Meanwhile, the Sovereign of Sky gazed at Yang Ye. He was about to speak when Yang Ye suddenly vanished on the spot, and the Sovereign of Sky’s expression changed drastically.

He was just about to act, but at this moment…

Hiss!

Yang Ye suddenly appeared behind a Sage who wasn’t too far away on the Sovereign of Sky’s right. At this moment, a sword was in that Sage’s back!

Burial combined with Backstab!

A Sage had been killed in an instant!

Yang Ye drew out his sword, and blood sprayed. He stomped his right foot down, and the Sage before him exploded apart and blood sprayed throughout the surroundings!

Yang Ye turned around to glance at the Sovereign of Sky and the other Sages, “You want to kill me? Looks like not killing for so long has made all of you start to become overconfident!”
