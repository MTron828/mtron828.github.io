Chapter 1280 – Then I’ll Just Die!

The masked man’s neck suddenly split open, and then blood sprayed out from it.

He was astounded, and he knew that something had gone wrong within him. So, he immediately gave up on stabbing Yang Ye with his dagger and hurriedly immersed his mind into his body to suppress his blood. The blood that Yang Ye gained control of had instantly calmed down once he started to suppress it. However, around 10,000 swords suddenly surged out from within Yang Ye, and they instantly surrounded the masked man.

Rays of light crisscrossed throughout the surroundings.

The masked man was shocked. His figure shook, merged into space, and vanished from the encirclement of Yang Ye’s swords.

However, a mysterious force suddenly appeared here at the same time that his figure vanished.

“You! This... this is a Domain....” The masked man’s astonished voice resounded.

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!

The reply he got was countless blood red rays of sword energy and a dense expanse of rays of light.

“If I’m dying, then we’ll die together!” The masked man couldn’t escape while enveloped within the Sword Domain. He couldn’t conceal himself or flee. Because he was enveloped by Yang Ye’s sword formation, so he could only fight to the death!

Swish! Swish! Swish!

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!

The sound of sword energy and space being torn apart resounded incessantly while blood sprayed without end.

Just like that, the battle continued for almost 15 minutes before the rays of light dispersed. The swords fell to the ground, and then both Yang Ye and the masked man’s figures appeared once more.

At this moment, there were 5 swords stuck in the masked man’s body. There was a sword on each of his limbs and his chest. Besides that, there were countless injuries throughout his body. Especially his chest, it was covered in numerous holes. It seemed like he’d been shot by a million arrows.

As for Yang Ye, he wasn’t in a much better condition. Not to mention those 2 injuries on his stomach and back, there even were injuries on his throat, the center of his forehead, and the position of his heart on his chest. Fortunately, all of them weren’t very deep and weren’t lethal.

But his hands.... Presently, there was a dagger in his right wrist. It had stabbed through his wrist. Besides that, his shoulder had cracked open completely, and even the bones within had been cut open. There was only a little bit of flesh and bone holding his shoulder together, and his entire arm was dangling there as if it would fall off at any moment.

The masked man was looking at Yang Ye while Yang Ye was looking at the masked man as well. Both of them didn’t attack. It wasn’t that they didn’t want to, it was because they weren’t able to!

Suddenly, the space behind the masked man rippled, and then a dagger stabbed into the masked man’s throat.

It was Qian Lankong, of course.

The masked man asked, “Why?!”

“Why?” Qian Lankong had a ferocious expression on her face, “Do you remember Zephyr City’s Li Clan from a few hundred years ago? I think you’ve definitely forgotten. Because you’ve killed so many, so how could you possibly remember a trivial minor world? But I remember! The Li Clan had over 1,300 members. Over 1,300 members were all killed by you. Unfortunately, you missed one!”

“Impossible!” The masked man continued, “I never miss anyone when I strike!”

“Do you know why you missed one?” Besides ferocity, there was a trace of madness on Qian Lankong’s face, “Because I wasn’t within the Li Clan Estate at the time of your attack. I was outside, and I watched as you slaughtered my entire clan. After you killed them, you even came to me and rubbed my head. Haha! At that time, you definitely weren’t aware that I was a member of the Li Clan as well!”

“I remember you now!” The masked man said, “You chased after me for 3 days and nights, and you wanted me to accept you as my disciples. I refused, but I brought you to my Slayer Pavilion because you were so persistent, and I asked others to teach you instead. Haha! I was wondering why you would betray me. So, you’ve always wanted to do so. You....” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

His voice stopped abruptly at this point because Qian Lankong’s dagger had been cutting his throat slowly, and blood sprayed out from there and dyed both Qian Lankong’s dagger and hand bright red.

It didn’t take long for the man to take his last breath. Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly moved his finger slightly, and he put away both the masked man’s corpse and the swords.

Qian Lankong gazed at Yang Ye while Yang Ye gazed at her as well.

She didn’t speak, and her eyes were calm yet weren’t normal. Suddenly, a smile curled up on the corners of Yang Ye’s mouth, “Are you thinking of killing me and taking back the strands of your soul?”

Qian Lankong didn’t speak, and she just started walking towards Yang Ye. It didn’t take long for her to arrive in front of Yang Ye. After that, she pressed her dagger against Yang Ye’s throat, “I can cut off your head at the instant you destroy my soul. I don’t want to take you down with me, and I don’t want to become enemies with you. Give me back my soul, and I’ll leave!”

Yang Ye shook his head, “No!”

Qian Lankong’s eyes narrowed slightly while killing intent appeared within them, “Yang Ye, I don’t want to make both of us suffer, but it doesn’t represent that I don’t dare to take you down with me. Just think about it. What would your Sword Alliance and those loved ones of yours do if I take you down with me? Besides that, there’s no enmity between us, so is it worth it to die with me?”

“It isn’t!” Yang Ye continued, “But if I return it to you and you leave while leaving me here, then I’ll still die once those fellows from the Veiled Region arrive.”

Qian Lankong spoke coldly, “That’s your problem!”

Yang Ye said, “Returning it to you will lead to my death, not returning it to you will lead to my death as well. So, instead of doing that, why don’t I take you down with me? At least I’ll have someone to accompany me. Don’t you think so too?”

Qian Lankong gazed at him for a long time before she said, “What do you want?”

Yang Ye replied, “It’s very simple. Take me from here, and I’ll return your soul once I’ve recovered completely.”

Qian Lankong asked, “What assurance can you give me?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “I don’t know how to make you trust me. In any case, help me, and I’ll return your soul once I’ve recovered. I keep my word.”

Qian Lankong pressed her dagger against Yang Ye’s throat. It pierced his skin, and Yang Ye instantly felt a wave of icy coldness come from there. Meanwhile, Qian Lankong said, “I don’t want to get mixed up with you. Return my soul, and I’ll leave. We’ll be even, and I won’t look for trouble with you in the future. You....”

Yang Ye suddenly said, “Just kill me!”

Qian Lankong’s face fell, “You think I wouldn’t dare to?”

“I know you would!” Yang Ye continued, “But aren’t you leaving me here because you want me to be killed by those fellows from the Veiled Region, or perhaps you’ll kill me right away once you get your soul. So, unless I have the ability to protect myself, I won’t return your soul to you.”

Qian Lankong replied, “But how do I know that you won’t go back on your word once you’ve recovered.”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and answered, “Your worries aren’t wrong. But I don’t have a way to resolve that problem. After all, we don’t trust each other.”

Qian Lankong’s face became slightly hostile, “In the end, everything you said was a bunch of nonsense?”

Yang Ye looked her in the eyes and said, “I’m a sword cultivator, so I won’t go back on my word. Otherwise, it would go against my heart. I....”

“All I know is that you’re shameless!” Qian Lankong looked him in the eyes and said, “I might choose to believe another sword cultivator, but you? I’m sorry, I don’t trust you.” She still remembered how Yang Ye had shifted the blame to her and even played tricks on them.

“Then kill me!” Yang Ye continued, “You have a choice, but I don’t. Because I’ll die no matter what. But you won’t. We’ll both live if you choose to save me.”

She said, “Are you trying to act shamelessly until the end?”

Yang Ye was about to speak when Qian Lankong suddenly frowned, “Someone is approaching.”

Yang Ye replied, “If I return your soul, I’ll still die even if you don’t kill me and just leave!”

She made a compromise, “Give me back my soul and I’ll save you!”

Yang Ye shook his head, “Save me first and I’ll return it to you.”

Her voice became ferocious, “Do you really want to die?”

Yang Ye stared straight at her.

As she gazed at Yang Ye who seemed to be telling her to just kill him, Qian Lankong’s face was horrifyingly gloomy. A few breaths of time passed before she suddenly grabbed Yang Ye and vanished on the spot.

Just a moment after both of them vanished, Senior Yuan and the others arrived here.

Ye Ming spoke solemnly, “The space here has collapsed many times, and the smell of blood lingers in the air. Obviously, they fought intensely here.”

One of the old men asked, “Who won?”

Ye Ming and the others gazed at Senior Yuan. Senior Yuan frowned as he glanced at the surroundings, and then he said, “If Yang Ye is dead, then I think the master of Slayer Pavilion would notify us of his death. But he hasn’t. In other words, there are only 2 possibilities. Either the master of the Slayer Pavilion is dead, or Yang Ye has fled and he’s chasing after Yang Ye!”

“If the master of Slayer Pavilion was killed....” Ye Ming’s voice stopped abruptly at this point.

The expressions of the others became slightly unsightly when they heard him. Because if Yang Ye was even able to kill a living fossil like the Slayer Pavilion’s master, then Yang Ye’s strength was much stronger than they’d imagined! But Yang Ye was just a Quasi Emperor!

A Quasi Emperor!

A pair of shocking words!

If he was already able to kill a living fossil like the Slayer Pavilion’s master, then if he were to attain the Emperor Realm or Voider Realm, no one would be a match for him.

At this moment, all of them would rather believe Yang Ye had died than the Slayer Pavilion’s master had died.

Because if Yang Ye had killed the Slayer Pavilion’s master while at the Quasi Emperor Realm.... Just thinking about it was horrifying!

Meanwhile, Senior Yuan spoke, “The master of Slayer Pavilion is a living fossil. Even I’m not confident in my ability to kill him in a head-on battle. If he conceals himself, then even I have to fear him. No matter how monstrous that fellow, Yang Ye, is, it’s impossible for him to kill the Slayer Pavilion’s master. Yang Ye should be fleeing now.... In short, from this moment onward, we have to split up and search, and try our best to find him.

The others exchanged glances upon hearing this. They knew that even Senior Yuan was slightly anxious right now. Actually, it was normal because if Yang Ye had killed a living fossil like the Slayer Pavilion’s master, then once Yang Ye attained the Emperor Realm, even Senior Yuan would be unable to escape death in a battle with Yang Ye!

All of them vanished on the spot with heavy hearts. Meanwhile, as Senior Yuan looked towards the distance, killing intent had appeared in his eyes for the very first time.

...

Around 500,000km away.

Yang Ye’s voice was quite weak, “Carry me on your back!”

Qian Lankong replied, “Dream on!”

“You’re too fast! My body can’t endure it....”

Qian Lankong spoke angrily, “What does that have to do with me?!”

“If you don’t carry me, then I’ll just die!”
