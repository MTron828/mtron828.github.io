Chapter 1326 – I Run, You Run, Everyone’s Running!

Actually many human Emperors had wanted to flee because the Emperors of the demon race didn’t just outnumber them, the Emperors of the demon race were stronger than them as well. But they were very clearly aware that Heaven Pillar Peak would be finished if they fled. Once Heaven Pillar Peak was breached, the human race would be finished. Because it was the last natural barrier that the human race had!

So, even if they knew they were no match for the demon race, they were still fighting. Moreover, they had hope, and it was placed in the Voiders fighting in midair. The number of human Voiders surpassed the demon race. So long as those Voiders could free themselves from their respective battles, then the situation would instantly turn around. However, they were disappointed.

Not a single Voider, not even Nie Hun, dared to fight the young woman.

No one dared to fight the young woman and were fleeing instead, and they were allowing her to kill Emperors like them. So, would anyone be willing to stay and fight?

At this moment, the human race wasn’t in their minds anymore. In their opinion, since the Voiders were fleeing, then they would flee as well!

Everyone should flee!

The human army instantly collapsed!

The faces of the human Voiders throughout the surroundings became extremely unsightly when they witnessed this scene. Could those Emperors be blamed? Of course not. Because most of those Emperors were part of their clans or sects. Moreover, Voiders like them should be dealing with the young woman. However, they didn’t dare to go against her, and it caused those Emperors to have to face her.

Emperors would just be giving their lives away when facing her. They didn’t even have the strength to fight back! Under such circumstances, to mention those Emperors, even they would flee!

Would anyone be willing to just give their lives away?

The Voiders of the 3 sects and 3 cities gazed at Nie Hun, and their faces were extremely hostile.

Nie Hun was the only one here who could fight the young woman. Perhaps he couldn’t defeat her, but he was absolutely capable of keeping her busy. Moreover, he was the only Voider on the same level as the young woman. However, he’d chosen to flee without putting up a fight, and it caused the deaths of 2 Voiders on their side.

It was exactly why the demon race had instantly turned the situation around!

The human Voiders gazed at Nie Hun when they thought up to this point, and their faces grew even more hostile.

But Nie Hun paid no attention to them, and he just gazed in the direction of the demon race’s territory while a trace of anxiousness could be seen in his eyes.

Meanwhile, the young woman suddenly raised her hand and said, “Those big fellows at the front, knock down that mountain. Those fellows flying in the air, pursue those fleeing humans. Don’t leave a single one alive! Kill them all!”

The expressions of everyone here changed, and they gazed at Nie Hun. However, Nie Hun paid no attention to them and was still looking in the direction of the demon race’s territory.

Lin Qian and the others’ hearts blazed with rage, and Lin Qian glared angrily at Nie Hun, “Nie Hun, what exactly is your Nie Clan planning?!”

Nie Hun glanced at Lin Qian, and there was a trace of fervor and excitement in his eyes, “We plan to do something great!” Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Great my ass!” Lin Tian roared with fury, “Just take a look. Heaven Pillar Peak is about to be destroyed! It’s about to be destroyed!”

Nie Hun replied indifferently, “If it’s destroyed, then it’s destroyed. They demon race and everything else would be meaningless once my ancestor gets that treasure.”

“You!” Lin Qian and the others almost spat out a mouthful of blood. How could they not understand everything right now? The Nie Clan had no intention to protect Heaven Pillar Peak, and it had other motives instead. In other words, they’d been used!

Used!

Lin Qian and the others wanted to attack, but they hadn’t lost their minds. The Voiders of the demon race weren’t too far away from them, and that young woman was there as well.

Nie Hun paid no attention to them and just gazed off into the distance.

Meanwhile, a flame appeared on the young woman’s palm. Nie Hun, Lin Qian, and the others’ expressions changed at the sight of it. Nie Hun’s profound energy surged while gales started to blow beneath his feet. Obviously, he was ready to flee at any moment. Lin Qian and the others were ready to flee right away as well. No one dared to remain fearless before that young woman.

But where could they flee? Heaven Pillar Peak was about to be destroyed, and the demon race’s army would march forward into the human race’s territory. At that time, where could they run to?

Just thinking about what was about to happen in the future made sorrow well up in their hearts.

Mo Xiaoleng had a cold smile on the corners of her mouth, and the flame on her palm burned brilliantly. She glanced at them and was about to toss the flame forward, but a figure suddenly appeared not too far ahead from her. Mo Xiaoleng’s eyes immediately narrowed at the sight of that person, and then she tossed the flame at him.

It was Yang Ye, of course!

Yang Ye’s eyelids twitched when he saw Mo Xiaoleng toss the flame at him without the slightest hesitation. That horrible woman really wants to kill me!

Even Yang Ye didn’t dare act carelessly when facing that golden flame. He drew his sword and swung it right away. A ray of sword energy shot forward and instantly struck the golden flame.

However, Yang Ye’s eyelids twitched because his sword energy was obliterated by the flame, and the golden flame didn’t slow down at all as it shot towards him like a bolt of lightning.

Mo Xiaoleng’s laughter that was filled with ridicule resounded, and then another golden flame appeared on her palm.

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly. He didn’t attack again, and he just patted his chest lightly. It didn’t take long for a small head to emerge from there. It was naturally Snowy. She blinked, and then her gaze instantly descended onto the golden flame that was just around 3m away from Yang Ye.

Snowy’s eyes instantly lit up at the sight of it, and then she opened her mouth and inhaled. The flame instantly shot into her mouth.

Everyone who witnessed this scene was stunned.

After she swallowed the flame, Snowy’s figure trembled slightly, and then she gazed at the flame on Mo Xiaoleng’s palm, and then a string of liquid form spirit energy flowed down the corner of her mouth.

The corners of Mo Xiaoleng’s eyes twitched, and she flipped her palm and put the flame away.

Snowy was instantly stunned by this, and then she was filled with fury. She clenched her claws and gnashed her teeth while staring at Mo Xiaoleng, and she seemed like she would fight Mo Xiaoleng to the death if Mo Xiaoleng refused to hand the flame over.

The corners of Mo Xiaoleng’s mouth twitched slightly. She hesitated for a moment before flipping her right palm, and then a violet fruit appeared in her grasp. She flicked the violet fruit over to Snowy and said, “Have this instead!”

Snowy blinked at the sight of the violet fruit. She stopped gnashing her teeth and relaxed her claws before taking the fruit and biting it. She took 2 bites before she seemed to have thought of something, and then she flew over to Yang Ye and passed it to him with a brilliant smile on her face.

Yang Ye’s heart felt warm. He rubbed her head gently and said, “Head in and hide for now.” As he spoke, he pointed at his chest.

Snowy nodded, and then she went into the pocket of space while holding the fruit in her claws.

Yang Ye paid no attention to Mo Xiaoleng, and he just gazed at Lin Qian and the others, “Lead your forces to Dark Hell Continent.”

Actually, this was the reason why he’d showed himself. The Veiled Region would be finished once the demon race breached Heaven Pillar Peak, and once the Veiled Region was conquered, he couldn’t guarantee that the demon race wouldn’t attack Dark Hell Continent as well.

So, he’d decided to save them and let them head to Dark Hell Continent. If he didn’t show himself, many of them would die at Mo Xiaoleng hands. As for the Emperors, they would have no chance to live once the Voiders weren’t there to protect them. After all, the blue rocs in the sky were far swifter than human Emperors!

Even though the 3 sects and 3 cities had lost many experts, they still had quite a few Voiders and Emperors. If the demon race attacked Dark Hell Continent in the future, then all of them would be a huge help to him.

Lin Qian and the others exchanged glances when they heard Yang Ye, and then they cupped their fists to Yang Ye and left. It was impossible to defend Heaven Pillar Peak now, so heading to Dark Hell Continent like Yang Ye had said was naturally the best choice for them. It was their only choice. Because if they stayed in the Veiled Region, the demon race would pursue them until they were dead!

The human Emperors didn’t die that quickly when protected by Lin Qian and the other Voiders. However, many still suffered miserable deaths. Because the demon race’s army hadn’t given up on pursuing and killing the humans, and even 2 human Voiders perished during the pursuit.

However, Yang Ye had no time to pay attention to all of that. All he could do right now was keep Mo Xiaoleng busy. Otherwise, not to mention the Emperors, even the Voiders wouldn’t be able to escape. Those Voiders weren’t able to fight back at all when facing her.

Mo Xiaoleng stared fixedly at Yang Ye. Yang Ye refused to show any weakness and met her gaze. However, he was vigilant in his heart. He didn’t dare act carelessly at all when facing her. After all, even he really feared that golden flame of hers. Besides that he still remembered that she still had another blue flame.

Moreover, she was very mysterious, so he couldn’t be certain that she had no other trump cards!

Mo Xiaoleng gazed at Yang Ye for a short while. Suddenly, she stretched out her hand and clawed lightly at him. This movement caused the space around Yang Ye to instantly warp and violently. The powerful shredding force it had caused Yang Ye to immediately frown. Because he felt like his body was actually about to be torn apart by something!

Bang!

Rebirth Rank sword intent surged out from within Yang Ye. However, it had just appeared when it started to warp along with the space in his surroundings.

Yang Ye’s face changed slightly. He hadn’t expected even Rebirth Rank sword intent to be useless. He was about to attack when a ray of violet light flashed. As soon as that happened, the warping space around him instantly stopped for a moment, and then it started to return to normal. Even though it was a little slow, it didn’t feel like it could shred him anymore.

Around 10 breaths of time later, the space around Yang Ye returned to normal.

“Spatial Mink!” Mo Xiaoleng clenched her fists, “As a noble member of the demon race, you’re actually helping a human! You truly disappoint me!”

As she spoke, she flipped her right palm, and a flame appeared on it. She was about to toss it at Yang Ye when Yang Ye’s eyelids twitched, and he hurriedly patted his chest. Snowy emerged right away. Mo Xiaoleng’s eyelids twitched at the sight of Snowy, and she hurriedly withdrew the flame.

Mo Xiaoleng was clearly quite infuriated. She had a murderous gaze when she looked at Yang Ye, and her hands were trembling from rage.

Suddenly, Yang Ye pointed at Nie Hun who still hadn’t fled and said, “Why don’t we kill him first? You can vent first before we fight one on one, alright?

Mo Xiaoleng turned to look at Nie Hun, and then a flame appeared in her palm.
