Chapter 1537 - I Need To Use My True Form To Fight All Of You?

Translator: InVader

Hu Meng glanced at Yang Ye and said, “Is he really that strong?”

Yang Ye nodded in an extremely serious manner, “Extremely strong!”

Hu Meng nodded slightly, “If even you think he’s so strong, then it seems like that fellow really is very strong!”

Yang Ye smiled, and then he spoke seriously, “How did you hear about him?”

“The princess of the Divine Phoenix Clan!” Hu Meng spoke in a low voice, “She said that anyone who kills Yang Ye can cultivate in the Hallowed Grounds of the Divine Phoenix Clan. Moreover, that person can even choose one of the divine flames that she has gathered.”

Mo Xiaoleng! Yang Ye’s face gradually became cold. How much does she hate me?

Meanwhile, Hu Meng added, “Even though those conditions are extremely tempting, very few demon beasts accepted that mission.”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Why?”

Hu Meng replied, “I guess you don’t know how strong she is. Since even she couldn’t do anything to him, it’s obvious how strong that fellow, Yang Ye, is.”

Yang Ye asked, “Is the princess of the Divine Phoenix Clan very well known in the demon race?” DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Hu Meng laughed bitterly, “She isn’t just well known. You don’t know how formidable she is. She’s like an overlord in the demon race. Her logic is simply unparalleled. In any case, anyone in our demon race who meets her will definitely suffer. I wonder if she’ll be attending the Meeting of the Clans. However, based on how proud she is, I don’t think she will.”

Yang Ye spoke indifferently, “It’s best if she doesn’t!”

Hu Meng nodded, “If she attends, then there’ll be no peace in this year’s event. Right, it’s starting in two days from now. Just rest well. I’m going to rest during these two days too.” As soon as he finished speaking, Hu Meng turned around and left Yang Ye’s room.

Once Hu Meng left, Yang Ye sat down cross-legged and started absorbing spirit energy.

In the next two days, Yang Ye was cultivating at all times. However, he didn’t do it in the room but in the Primordial Pagoda instead.

This time, Yang Ye cultivated the Undying Elemental Body and Elemental Breaker techniques. Even though he’d grasped them, they still had huge room for improvement.

The Meeting of the Clans!

He naturally didn’t dare to be careless or underestimate the degree of competition he would face during the event. After all, he couldn’t use his sword. Even though the demon race could start cultivating profound energy upon attaining the Deity Realm, he wasn’t from the demon race. So, once he drew his sword, it would definitely expose his identity as a human.

Under the circumstances that he couldn’t use the sword, he didn’t have any advantage over the true geniuses of the demon race!

Fortunately, his objective was just the top three and not the first. If it was just the top three, then it shouldn’t be a huge problem. However, he still couldn’t be careless. After all, the demon race had so many demon beasts in it, so who knew how many monstrous geniuses were amongst them?

After 20 days passed in the Primordial Pagoda, Yang Ye who sat cross-legged on the 3rd level had opened his eyes, and he slowly clenched his right fist. In an instant, a wave of energy converged in his fist, and as more and more energy converged there, the space around his fist started to tremble violently. It didn’t take long for Yang Ye to relax his fist, and the energy instantly dispersed.

A smile curled up on the corners of Yang Ye’s mouth. Both the Undying Elemental Body and Elemental Breaker had gained obvious improvements in the last 20 days. Especially the Elemental Breaker technique. He’d gained new comprehensions related to it. In short, he’d gained quite a bit in the last 20 days.

After he accompanied Xiao Yuxi for a while, Yang Ye went to the 2nd level of the Primordial Pagoda.

Yang Ye went to the pill furnace. At this moment, the little girl was lying lazily within the furnace. Even though she was lying in front of the Divine Yin Flame, she was completely unharmed. Moreover, the Divine Yin Flame was frequently covering her in its flames. The little girl seemed happy and relaxed when she was enveloped by it.

Yang Ye smiled as he gazed at her. He hadn’t expected her to actually gain the favor of the Divine Yin Flame. It was definitely an extraordinarily fortunate thing for her because he noticed that she was gradually changing. Obviously, it was all thanks to the Divine Yin Flame.

Yang Ye didn’t interrupt her, and he just left the Primordial Pagoda.

…

In the outside world.

Even though around 20 days had passed in the Primordial Pagoda, only two days had passed in the outside world.

Yang Ye left his cultivation room. At this moment, Hu Meng was waiting outside.

Yang Ye said, “Shall we go?”

Hu Meng nodded, and then he left the underground cultivation room with Yang Ye.

“The Meeting of the Clans is divided into three stages. The first stage is called Weeding Out The Weak.” While they traveled, Hu Meng explained, “Because too many are participating, the weak will be weeded out during the first stage. In other words, everyone will be gathered together to fight each other, and the last 1,000 who remain standing will enter the second round.”

“Everyone will be gathered together to fight each other?” Yang Ye frowned, “Wouldn’t that be very chaotic? After all, there are definitely countless who are participating, right?”

Hu Meng smiled, “Of course it won’t be everyone at once. We’ll be divided up into 10 groups, and the last 100 standing in every group will advance to the next round.”

Yang Ye nodded slightly, “That’s not bad. However, it’s a little too barbaric and violent.” If so many demon beasts were to be gathered together and only the 100 who remained standing in the end could advance to the next round, then it would definitely be extremely brutal. However, it did make sense to him. After all, this was the demon race, and the demon race liked such barbaric and violent methods!

Meanwhile, Hu Meng suddenly asked, “Are you the only representative from the Goat Clan?”

Yang Ye nodded, “Just me!”

Hu Meng nodded slightly, “The Goat Clan keeps quite a low profile. In any case, since I could remember things, I’ve never seen anyone from the Goat Clan participating in the Meeting of the Clans. If you’re able to get good results this time, then it’ll definitely bring glory to your entire Goat Clan.”

Yang Ye smiled, “I hope so!”

It didn’t take long for them to arrive at a square under Hu Meng’s lead. At this moment, the square was filled with people, and there were 10 teleportation formations at the center of the square.

“Spatial Battlefields!” Meanwhile, Hu Meng explained, “The Spatial Battlefields that our Demon Alliance created are on the other side of those teleportation formations.”

Even though Yang Ye didn’t know much about many things, he didn’t doubt Yang Ye. Because as far as he was concerned, Yang Ye was from the Goat Clan, and the Goat Clan was at the bottom of the demon race. Coupled with the fact that it was Yang Ye’s first time here, he felt that it was only natural that Yang Ye didn’t know all of this.

“The Demon Alliance?” Yang Ye gazed at Hu Meng, “What’s that?”

Hu Meng explained, “Our demon race has many clans, but each clan governs itself. For the sake of preventing other races from bullying us, we created the Demon Alliance. If we encounter invaders from outside our territory, the alliance will give the orders, and all clans must obey those orders. Even powerful clans like the Divine Phoenix Clan and Heavenly Dragon Clan have to obey those orders. We have to stay united in order to survive on this continent.”

Yang Ye nodded. Sky Sky Continent was filled with numerous races of living beings, so if any race didn’t stay united, then the consequence would be annihilation!

Hu Meng said, “Let’s go register ourselves!”

Yang Ye was stunned, “We have to register?”

“Of course!” Hu Meng continued, “Or how will anyone know who you are?”

Yang Ye nodded, “Right!”

It didn’t take long for them to arrive before an old man who was in front of the teleportation formations. The old man held a scroll that was almost 3m wide, and he was recording something.

The old man didn’t even raise his head as he said, “Name and clan!”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and said, “The Goat Clan! Xiao Yang!” The reason he didn’t use Ye Yang was because he’d used that name on Dark Hell Continent. Moreover, he’d used the same name at many other places as well. The Divine Phoenix Clan had enmity with him, so it would have definitely investigated him. If they knew about the fake names he’d used in the past and he still used them, then he might fall into quite an embarrassing situation.

The old man looked up at Yang Ye when he heard this. He was clearly stunned when he saw Yang Ye’s figure, and then he said, “The Goat Clan?”

Yang Ye spoke indifferently, “I don’t look like one?”

The old man glanced at Yang Ye and said, “You look really like one. However, are you really sure? Even though killing is prohibited during the competition, it’s very common for some to die during the competitions of the past.”

Yang Ye replied, “I’m not afraid of death!”

The old man nodded, “Let me warn you that once you register yourself and something happens to you during the competition, the responsibility is yours.”

Yang Ye said, “In other words, if someone is killed, the clan of that demon beast can’t take revenge. Right?”

“Of course!” The old man said, “Your fate is your own responsibility during the Meeting of the Clans. If you kill someone, you don’t have to worry because their clans can’t take revenge on you. If they insist on taking revenge, then our Demon Alliance will lend you a hand. Of course, if you’re killed, the Goat Clan can’t take revenge for you as well. So, are you still going to participate?”

Yang Ye nodded. Needless to say, the demon race did very well in this aspect. Their fate in the competition was their own responsibility. In this way, the chances of internal strife within the demon race would be at its lowest. The human race was different. If one killed during a competition held by humans, then the consequence might be that one would suffer the revenge of that person’s clan. In that way, two clans might enter into war.

The human race loved to exhaust its own strength!

Once he saw Yang Ye nod, the old man didn’t say another word. He registered Yang Ye and said, “You can go in now.”

Yang Ye nodded, and then he waited for Hu Meng to complete his registration before entering the sixth teleportation formation together.

It didn’t take long for Yang Ye and Hu Meng to appear on a spacious plain. The plain was boundless and extremely wide.

The Spatial Battlefield!

This area had been constructed in space!

At this moment, a huge number of demon beasts were in the surroundings. Yang Ye was surprised to see that all of them had returned to their original form, and even Hu Meng had returned to his original form.

In an instant, Yang Ye understood what was going on. Demon beasts were only able to display their true strength when they were in their original form.

Yet now, he was in quite an embarrassing position. Because he was the only one here who hadn’t returned to his original form.

So, many demon beasts gazed at Yang Ye, and their gazes were extremely hostile.

Obviously, they suspected he was human again.

They couldn’t be blamed for it. Because it really was too unusual. Moreover, those demon beasts here weren’t the only ones looking at Yang Ye, even Hu Meng was looking at Yang Ye, and there was a trace of bewilderment in his eyes.

Yang Ye remained silent for a moment, and then he suddenly glanced at the surroundings and shouted, “What are all of you looking at? Do I even need to use my true form to fight all of you?”
