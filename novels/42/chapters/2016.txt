Chapter 2017 – I Specialize in Dealing with Dissatisfaction!

Once he left the Sky Dimension, Yang Ye shot straight for the Devil Dimension.

He didn’t really care about someone from the Weapon Path coming to challenge him. He would resolve the matters between him and the Weapon Path in the future, but it wouldn’t be now. However, this incident allowed him to realize that the Weapon Path had started paying attention to him!

It was best to be careful!

A day later, Yang Ye arrived on a plain, and only withered grass and a scene of desolation filled his vision.

Yang Ye sped up, but it didn’t take long for him to stop. There was a dried well in front of him. It was quite huge, and it was over 300m wide.

The Devil Well!

It was a passageway into the Devil Dimension.

Yang Ye glanced at the well. It was bottomless. He didn’t hesitate to leap down into it.

Yang Ye’s figure dropped down!

Faint light gradually appeared around Yang Ye. The well was a spatial passageway.

Sometime later, Yang Ye felt dizzy, but it didn’t take long for the dizziness to vanish.

Yang Ye opened his eyes, and towering mountains filled his field of vision. Besides that, there was a teleportation formation below his feet.

The Devil Dimension!

Suddenly, a voice came from the side, “Identify yourself!”

Yang Ye looked over and saw a middle aged man in black armor.

Yang Ye asked, “Why?”

The middle aged man replied, “Outsiders who enter the Devil Dimension must pay 100 immortal crystals!”

“100 immortal crystals?” Yang Ye glanced at the middle aged man, and then he flicked a spatial ring over to the man.

The middle aged man glanced at the spatial ring and said, “You can go!”

Yang Ye asked, “Tell me something, have there been many who came here recently?”

The middle aged man glanced at Yang Ye, “You’re probably here for the Sage Ruins, right?”

The middle aged man was very courteous, and his attitude was very amiable too. Because he was very well aware that those who dared to come here on their own were not weaklings. Moreover, the man before him even felt unfathomable. It could be said that he wouldn’t have done anything even if Yang Ye refused to pay the immortal crystals.

Yang Ye nodded.

The middle aged man said, “Many have been coming here lately, and they’re from all the races. However, I never saw anyone from the sky race. Of course, they’re definitely here, but they are probably in hiding!”

Yang Ye gazed at the middle aged man, “The sky race?”

The middle aged man nodded, “The sky race is a sworn enemy of my devil race, so they naturally wouldn’t dare to come here openly. However, the Sage Ruins belongs to a Sage of the sky race, so I presume they definitely won’t give up on obtaining it. However, the geniuses of my devil race are prepared. So, the geniuses of the sky race will probably have to suffer when the time comes!”

Yang Ye gazed at the middle aged man and smiled, “I’m not from the sky race, I’m from the human race.”

Yang Ye turned around and vanished on the spot.

The middle aged man visibly relaxed and relaxed his grip. There was a talisman in his grasp. His main mission was to wait for the geniuses from the sky race and report their arrival.

Yang Ye stood at the top of a mountain and looked off into the distance. Tall mountains stretched endlessly to the ends of his vision. Yang Ye closed his eyes slightly, and a short while passed before he opened them again and said, “Horizon Mountain?”

Horizon Mountain was where the Sage Ruins had appeared.

Yang Ye fell silent for a short while, and then he twisted his right foot on the ground. A glowing sword appeared below his feet, and then he transformed into a ray of light that shot into the sky.

Yang Ye closed his eyes within the clouds and shot forward on his sword. His consciousness had entered the Primordial Pagoda.

Yang Ye went over to the Divine Yin Flame and asked, “Senior, do you know anything about the Prediction Line in the Weapon Path?”

The Divine Yin Flame remained silent for a short while and said, “Kid, instead of worrying about the Weapon Path’s Prediction Line, you should worry about the Dao Path. The Dao Path doesn’t have that many lines, and it only has three. All three lines fight against each other, and it’s not any less dangerous than the Weapon Path, and it may even be more dangerous.”

Yang Ye laughed bitterly, “I have the Dao Path and Weapon Path to worry about. Great!”

“While you’ve been swept into two vortexes like this, the benefits are quite many too, right?” The Divine Yin Flame continued, “Let’s ignore the Weapon Path for now. Just the Dao Path has given you the Primordial Pagoda and Master’s acknowledgement. These are huge, fortuitous encounters for you. Of course, at the same time, they represent that you’ll have to shoulder many things. But as they always say, nothing comes free in this world. If you gain something, you pain something!”

Yang Ye nodded, “I understand! I just feel like my future path is filled with trouble!”

The Divine Yin Flame asked, “Are you afraid of trouble?”

Yang Ye smiled, “I am, of course I am!”

The Divine Yin Flame said, “Then work hard on becoming stronger. So long as you’re strong enough, you’ll naturally have no problems!”

Yang Ye shook his head slightly, “That’s what I thought in the past. But now I realized that the stronger I become, the more trouble I face!”

Since he started his journey on Profounder Continent, Yang Ye was countless times stronger now. However, not only had his problems not reduced, they were even growing.

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts and spoke solemnly, “Right, according to my knowledge, there’s an evil treasure following me. Can you sense it?”

The Divine Yin Flame replied, “I can’t!”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Why?”

The Divine Yin Flame replied, “It’s at a much higher level than me.”

Yang Ye was stunned speechless.

The Divine Yin Flame said, “She’s linked to the quintessence of the large universe, and she was born with the spirit of this universe. That’s also the reason why that Sage merely suppressed her but didn’t kill her. That Sage couldn’t kill her, and even if he could, he wouldn’t dare to. Because destroying a part of the universe’s quintessence would incur public wrath!” T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Yang Ye spoke solemnly, “Why did she choose me?”

The Divine Yin Flame, “Perhaps she just doesn’t like you!”

Yang Ye’s face darkened, and the Divine Yin Flame added, “Actually, you should be happy. Beings like her are extremely proud! She wouldn’t even glance at ordinary people. Since she has taken a liking to you, it represents that you’re very outstanding and you have great potential. She wouldn’t even spare a glance at most people!”

Yang Ye laughed bitterly, “Would you be happy when someone who wants to kill you is constantly following you in secret, but you can’t see that person? So, tell me something. Why isn’t she attacking me right now?”

“It’s the Primordial Pagoda of course!” The Divine Yin Flame continued, “She doesn’t dare to enter you while you have the Primordial Pagoda. Of course, there’s an exception to that. For example, if you’re heavily injured and unconscious. At that time, she may risk everything and try while you’re unconscious. Once she succeeds at acknowledging you as her master, even the Primordial Pagoda would be helpless against her!”

Yang Ye was quite annoyed, “What I don’t understand is what she can do after acknowledging me as her master?”

“Devour!” The Divine Yin Flame explained, “She can devour everything you have. Your fortune, your luck… In short, she can devour everything. Of course, there’s probably another reason, but I don’t know why. You can ask her if you have the chance!”

Yang Ye glanced at the Divine Yin Flame and said, “Why do I feel like you’re taking pleasure in this?”

“I am?” The Divine Yin Flame said, “Not at all. In short, good luck!”

Yang Ye shook his head and went over to Zi’er. Little Sky was by her side.

Yang Ye asked, “How long will it take for her to regain consciousness?”

Little Sky remained silent.

Yang Ye gazed at her, “What’s wrong?”

Little Sky shook her head slightly, “I thought she merely suffered some damage to her soul, but now it seems like it’s worse than I thought. But I haven’t determined the exact cause.”

Yang Ye’s gaze instantly turned icy cold, “Did the Sovereign of Sky do something to her?”

Little Sky replied, “I don’t know. Give me two weeks. If she still doesn’t wake up by then, it proves that the Sovereign of Sky definitely did something to her!”

Yang Ye closed his eyes slowly, “If he really did, I’ll make him pay with blood!”

Zi’er was his reverse scale, and he would never let anyone touch her!

After staying with Little Sky and Zi’er for some time, Yang Ye left the Primordial Pagoda because he was about to reach his destination.

Around two hours later, Yang Ye stopped. There was a huge stone city not too far away from him, and it was made from all sorts of stones. So, the city seemed exceptionally huge, and it felt extremely solid!

Yang Ye looked up at the city wall, and he saw two words on it—Boulder City!

The words were made from rock as well!

Boulder City? Yang Ye sized up the city entrance and walked over. He entered the city without being obstructed at all. But as soon as he entered the city, his path was obstructed by a robust man.

It was a man from the devil race!

Yang Ye sized up the man and asked, “Do you need something?”

The young man glanced at Yang Ye, “The sky race?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “No!”

The young man suddenly grabbed Yang Ye’s shirt and pulled Yang Ye over to himself, “But why do I feel like you’re a bastard from the sky race?”

Yang Ye looked the young man in the eyes, “I told you, I’m not.”

A fierce smile curled up on the corners of the young man’s mouth, “Now, I have a stronger feeling that I’m right!”

Suddenly, Yang Ye attacked. He grabbed the young man’s throat.

However, the young man smiled coldly, “Do you think my body is something that trash like you can…”

Crack!

The sound of bones breaking resounded. The young man’s voice stopped abruptly, but he wasn’t dead.

Yang Ye slammed the young man against the ground.

Bang!

The ground exploded apart.

Yang Ye stomped his foot down on the young man’s chest, “Come, tell me! Am I from the sky race?”

The young man stared at Yang Ye. Suddenly, Yang Ye stomped his right foot down again.

Pu!

A mouthful of blood sprayed from the young man.

Yang Ye bent down and looked at the young man, “You’re dissatisfied?”

The young man roared with fury, “I am!”

“Is that so?” A cold smile curled up on the corners of Yang Ye’s mouth, “I specialize in dealing with that!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he slammed the young man against the ground again.

Bang! Bang!

The ground collapsed…
