Chapter 2190 – Returning to the Human Dimension!

At this moment, Yang Ye wished for nothing more than to slap himself.

Qin Chuan and the others were dead, but they had clans and families! But he’d overlooked that!

Dammit!

Yang Ye raised his speed to his limits, and an ocean of blood was left behind wherever he passed.

The Human Dimension.

It didn’t take long for Yang Ye to arrive in the Human Dimension.

He frowned as soon as he arrived.

The Human Dimension was covered in blood and slaughter intent. Presently, he was extremely sensitive to blood and slaughter intent, and the blood and slaughter intent here was too thick.

Yang Ye fell silent for a moment and descended to the ground.

A huge city stood before him, and the sounds of fighting resounded incessantly from within it.

Yang Ye walked slowly to the city. Suddenly, the slaughter intent in the city shot up into the air and converged to him like rivers converging into the ocean!

Yang Ye naturally accepted it all. While this slaughter intent was weak, sand could be piled up into a castle. The endless flow of slaughter intent would strengthen his own slaughter intent.

In these times, Yang Ye’s slaughter intent was like a fish in water because the times were chaotic now.

It was too chaotic, and the more slaughters occurred, the more slaughter intent would be produced, and his slaughter intent would grow stronger!

The Slaughter Dao!

While Yang Ye was on the path of the Sword Dao, he was gradually treading on the path of the Slaughter Dao as well.

In the city.

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings, and it was covered in destruction. Corpses were everywhere, and it was simply like hell on earth.

Boom!

Suddenly, a terrifying aura descended near Yang Ye. It was a middle aged man at the Major Zen Realm!

The middle aged man sized up Yang Ye, “A blind guy?”

Yang Ye frowned slightly, “You’re not a human?”

“Human?” The middle aged man chuckled, “Humans? From now onward, humans will cease to exist in the large universe. Cut the crap and hand over your spatial ring. I’ll let you die a little more comfortably if you do. Of course, the precondition is that your immortal crystals don’t disappoint me.”

Immortal crystals!

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings and walked away.

The middle aged man’s eyes narrowed slightly, “Looks like you…”

Hiss!

Suddenly, the middle aged man’s voice stopped abruptly, and then his head flew off his neck.

Blood sprayed like a pillar!

On the ground, the middle aged man’s eyes were opened wide, and he didn’t know how he’d died even until the moment he was dead.

Right when Yang Ye was about to leave the city, a woman appeared before Yang Ye. She seemed to be around the age of 17, and she was holding a sword while over a dozen injuries could be seen on her.

There were seven others by her side. There were old people, youths, and women.

All of their cultivations were only barely passable!

Yang Ye sensed dense slaughter intent coming from them.

They were all human.

Yang Ye flicked a spatial ring to her. She glanced at it, and there were over 10,000 immortal crystals in it!

Over 10,000!

It was sufficient to cause quite a commotion! After all, immortal crystals were the most precious thing in the large universe now.

They were comparable to a second life!

Yang Ye turned around once he did that and planned to leave. But she suddenly obstructed his path.

She looked him in the eyes, “You’re Yang Ye, right?”

Yang Ye!

The others were stunned when they heard that name.

Yang Ye!

Did anyone in the human race not know that name? He was once the king of the human race!

How powerful was the human race before Yang Ye left? Did anyone dare to attack it? It could be said that the humans could keep their heads held high then. Because they had Yang Ye, a powerful king.

He dared to declare war against the Alliance of All! And he dared to fight the Buddhist Path and Weapon Path!

The human race had no internal conflicts under Yang Ye’s leadership, and the human race was confident to fight any race at that time!

However, Yang Ye left in the end.

“Why?!” She walked slowly to Yang Ye while two streams of tears slowly seeped out of her eyes, “Why did you leave? Why did you abandon the human race? Why?”

Yang Ye replied, “I protected the human race once, but it doesn’t represent that I’ll do it forever. I don’t have such an obligation, right?”

“Then have you noticed?” Her voice grew loud, “The human race is about to die, it’s about to die!”

Yang Ye asked, “What does that have to do with me?”

She was stunned and said, “Y-You’re the king of the human race, you…”

“That was in the past!” Yang Ye continued, “The human race chose to abandon their king when attacked by the Alliance of All, they made that king of theirs face everything on his own. Of course, I understand. So, I left. Yet now, when the human race is in trouble, it wants that same king they abandoned to come back and save them? I’m not a savior, nor do I have the ability to do that. Besides that, I made the human race become united, but what happened in the end? The human race starts to fight amongst itself even before the Alliance of All attacked or the End Times truly arrives. If the human race dies, it brought it upon itself! No one else can be blamed for that!”

The woman took a deep breath, “You can save the human race, you can!”

“But why should I?” Yang Ye replied with a question, “So that you’ll leave again when I fight the Alliance of All?”

He patted her on the shoulder and said, “I’m not against you or anything like that, but the human race isn’t worthy of me doing anything for it. Moreover, I don’t have the ability to save the human race.”

Yang Ye vanished once he finished speaking, and only blood red remained in the sky.

The woman was stunned for a long time, and then she laughed bitterly, “Is the human race really finished?” ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Meanwhile, a middle aged man walked over to her and spoke softly, “Little An, don’t think too much about it. Actually, he’s correct. We chose to draw the line between him and us when the Alliance of All attacked, and we made him face their Sages on his own. Not to mention him, anyone would probably not return to the human race after that.”

The woman shook her head and spoke softly, “But now, perhaps only he can save the human race.”

The middle aged man sighed softly, “Why should he come back? We didn’t take his side when the Alliance of All attacked… Moreover, even if the Alliance of All doesn’t attack now, we’re still engaging in internal strife. We’ve all gone crazy killing each other for spirit energy, so no one can stop it.”

He glanced at the surroundings and said, “No one can save the human race.”

It didn’t take long for them to leave.

Presently, the only thing they could do was flee, flee as far as they could and avoid encountering any expert from the Alliance of All. Of course, they had to be careful of the human race’s experts. At most times, enemies from the outside weren’t the most terrifying, it was the enemies from within who were most terrifying. They were much more terrifying when they acted ruthlessly!

…

Dawn City.

Yang Ye arrived at an ancient city called Dawn City. It was Qin Chuan’s home, and the Qin Clan was here.

Just like the city he came from, it was in chaos too.

It was filled with corpses, blood, and slaughter intent!

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings and went straight to the Qin Estate.

The door was closed tight, and there was faint light all around it. Obviously, it was a formation.

Yang Ye walked to the entrance. Suddenly, a middle aged man appeared in front of him, and a spear shot swiftly toward Yang Ye’s forehead.

However, it was grabbed by two fingers!

The middle aged man was visibly astounded, “You…”

Yang Ye released it and said, “Who’s the patriarch of the Qin Clan?”

The middle aged man gazed vigilantly at Yang Ye, “Who are you?”

Yang Ye replied, “Take me to the Qin Clan’s patriarch! Don’t make me repeat myself!”

The middle aged man spoke solemnly, “Y-You…”

Suddenly, Yang Ye stomped his foot down lightly.

Bang!

The entire estate shook violently, and the formation around it instantly shattered.

The entire Qin Estate was alarmed!

It didn’t take long for a middle aged man in an embroidered robe to appear in front of Yang Ye with a group of old men.

When he saw Yang Ye, the middle aged man’s expression changed drastically, “Y-You…”

The middle aged man was the Qin Clan’s patriarch, one of the human race’s Sages. So, he naturally recognized Yang Ye. Now that he saw Yang Ye, he was naturally filled with shock.

The others clearly recognized Yang Ye too, and they were extremely shocked as well.

But it didn’t take long for quite an unsightly expression to appear on their faces.

Is he here to look for trouble?”

Yang Ye suddenly asked, “Who’s Qin Chuan’s father?”

The others from the Qin Clan exchanged glances, and it didn’t take long for a man to walk over to Yang Ye, “I am!”

Yang Ye nodded slightly, “Uncle, do you want to stay or leave? You can come with me if you want to leave.”

Qin Chuan!

At this moment, everyone recalled Qin Chuan. Only now did they recall that Qin Chuan was someone Yang Ye called a brother. Obviously, Yang Ye wasn’t here to look for trouble but to help!

Qin Chuan’s father heaved a sigh of relief in his heart. He hesitated for a moment and said, “M-My daughter, Qin Chuan’s younger sister, was kidnapped by an expert of the devil race. He said he’s going to make her his furnace. Please…”

Yang Ye nodded, “I’ll go to the Devil Dimension.”

Qin Chuan’s father bowed respectfully to Yang Ye, “Thank you!”

Yang Ye asked, “So do you want to stay or leave?”

The others gazed at Qin Chuan’s father, and there was a trace of a pleading expression in their eyes. Qin Chuan’s father hesitated for a moment and sighed softly, “This is my home.”

Yang Ye nodded, “I understand!”

Yang Ye flicked a spatial ring to Qin Chuan’s father, and then he vanished on the spot. But a strand of blood red sword energy appeared in the sky above the Qin Estate.

It just floated there in the air.

It didn’t take long for news of Yang Ye’s arrival in Dawn City to spread. At the same time, when some experts from the Alliance of All came to the Qin Estate, they glanced at the blood red sword energy and left Dawn City.

Dawn City suddenly became peaceful. No one dared to cause trouble in Dawn City, and no one dared to cause trouble for the Qin Estate.

That blood red sword energy represented that the Qin Estate was under Yang Ye’s protection!

In a room within the Qin Estate, Qin Chuan’s father gazed at the spatial ring before him. There were two streams of tears on his face, “Chuan’er, you have a good brother. But you’ll never come back again.”
