Chapter 2275 – Killing is the Only Way to Survive!

Bai Zhixian’s face was extremely gloomy. If her gaze could kill, Yang Ye would have died a million times by now.

While she was completely exposed, Yang Ye had no interest in her at all. He glanced at the surroundings and said, “I’m sure you know what I’d like to know!”

She remained silent.

Yang Ye looked down at her with an icy cold gaze, and his killing intent was undisguised. The latter fell silent for an instant and said, “The Eternal Border…”

Yang Ye interrupted her with a puzzled tone, “The Eternal Border? What the heck is that?”

Bai Zhixian glanced at Yang Ye and was about to speak, but she suddenly thought of something and flicked a thick book over to him. There were two large words on it—The Worlds!

Yang Ye tapped it lightly, and it transformed into a ray of black light that entered his forehead. In an instant, information appeared incessantly within his mind.

The Eternal Border!

The world they were in was the Eternal Border. It was called the Eternal Border because it was at the edge of the Eternal Universe. The Eternal Universe was a place that everyone in the Eternal Border yearned for.

It was because Eternal Energy existed in that universe!

In the book’s introductions, there were 10 supreme types of spirit energy in the myriad of universes. Primordial Violet Energy and Void Spirit Energy were among them, and they were ranked at the 6th and 5th respectively. Void Spirit Energy was ranked above Primordial Violet Energy!

Void Spirit Energy was a large part of the reason why Void Spirit Maiden was that strong. As for why the people of Eternal Border were targeting him, it was for the Primordial Pagoda and Primordial Violet Energy!

They wanted Primordial Violet Energy!

Of course, besides Primordial Violet Energy, they wanted the Bodhi Tree and Primordial Axe of Creation too. According to the book, there were 10 supreme treasures, and both the Bodhi Tree and Primordial Axe of Creation were among them. Especially, the Primordial Axe of Creation, it was ranked the 4th!

The Bodhi Tree was lower, and it was at the 10th!

But all of them were in Yang Ye’s possession.

Yang Ye was in quite a gloomy mood. Primordial Violet Energy may be ranked lower than Eternal Energy, but it was still something that countless experts dreamed of. Coupled with the Bodhi Tree and Primordial Axe of Creation he possessed, he could be said to be the focus of attention in Eternal Border.

The gazes of all the experts here were on him!

Besides that, Yang Ye found out from the book that the Eternal Border had 12 powers, an estate, two cities, three sects, and six clans. They were the Immortal Estate, White Emperor City, Sword Sky City, Martial Sect, Divine Martial Sect, and Sky Martial Sect….

Actually, the three sects were a single sect, but due to internal strife, they had split into three. Something worth mentioning was that all three of them idolized the same person.

As for the six clans, it was the Shiyuan Clan, the Nanli Clan, the Beichuan Clan, the Hanyuan Clan, the Luoli Clan, and Yue Clan.

The initial race was known as the Shiyuan Clan here.

All these clans had come from different universes, and they were once the supreme overlord of their respective universes, and they’d ceaselessly explored universes until finally settling down in Eternal Border.

It was because Eternal Border was at the border of the Eternal Universe, and the Eternal Universe was their goal.

While there had been some friction between the powers here, they had always been at peace. No one tried to cause trouble with another. Yet now, along with Yang Ye’s arrival, the Eternal Border was peaceful no more.

All of them were looking for Yang Ye!

They were fighting for the Primordial Pagoda, Bodhi Tree, and Primordial Axe of Creation!

All of them wanted those treasures for themselves!

Yang Ye closed his eyes slowly.

The situation was more serious than he’d imagined. Unless he handed over those three treasures, death was probably the only fate that awaited him. However, even if he was willing to hand them over, they wouldn’t let him live!

As far as those people were concerned, they refused to leave a potential problem alive. So long as Yang Ye was alive, he was a potential problem to them!

A long time passed before Yang Ye gazed at Bai Zhixian, “Who’s the person who signed this book at the end, Nanli Meng?”

Bai Zhixian replied indifferently, “A genius of the Nanli Clan, and someone who was once ranked at the 3rd position of the Eternal Border’s Divine Rankings. She was a rare genius of the Nanli Clan, and the pride of the Nanli Clan. If it wasn’t for her, the Nanli Clan would have ceased to exist in Eternal Border a long time ago!”

The Divine Rankings!

Yang Ye thought for a moment and asked, “What would my ranking be?”

“You?” A wisp of ridicule arose on the corners of her mouth, “You wouldn’t be in it even in another 10,000 years!”

Yang Ye felt speechless.

Bai Zhixian glanced at Yang Ye and remained silent, and the atmosphere here suddenly became quite silent.

Suddenly, Yang Ye grabbed his sword and stabbed it at the top of her head.

Kill!

He naturally planned to kill her!

Yang Ye was no fool. If he spared her today, she would kill him once she recovered. As for subduing her, only an idiot would have such thoughts. Of course, if she would become loyal to her once she slept with him, he wouldn’t mind making the sacrifice!

Unfortunately, such things only happened in novels!

Kill!

Kill without the slightest hesitation!

Yang Ye’s attack was extremely swift, but when it was just less than half an inch away from her head, Bai Zhixian’s body suddenly exploded apart. In an instant, a wave of powerful energy rippled out, and it instantly blasted Yang Ye far away!

Yang Ye looked up, and he saw her soul had transformed into a ray of dark light that vanished into the sky. At the same time, a voice came from far away, “Yang Ye! I’ll repay you a millionfold for this humiliation!”

As soon as the voice finished resounding, Yang Ye wasn’t able to sense her aura anymore.

Yang Ye’s face fell.

Self-detonation!

He hadn’t expected her to actually detonate her body. Detonating the physical body took a huge toll on a person, and it was why she had only detonated it when he attacked and not before!

Because even she would never want to sacrifice her own body unless she had no other choice. While it was absolutely easy for an expert at her level to rebuild the body, detonating the body harmed the mind and soul too!

It represented a huge loss of strength!

It could be said that even if Bai Zhixian restored her body, her strength would remain far inferior to what it had been for some time.

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings, and then he vanished on the spot.

At a pool in the mountains, a ray of sword energy shot into the pool. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Hiss!

The entire pool was sliced apart.

A long time passed before a head floated up onto the surface of it. It was Yang Ye!

Healing!

He’d suffered serious injuries during the battle with Bai Zhixian, but it had fully healed in less than an hour with the help of his Primordial Violet Energy.

Once he finished recuperating, Yang Ye left the pool and looked toward the south, and then his gaze gradually became icy cold.

The Shiyuan Clan! An Nanjing!

An Nanjing was in their possession!

However, he didn’t go there immediately. His main mission right now was to fortify his cultivation and straighten out his Slaughter Dao so it grew stronger. As for An Nanjing, he was very well aware, the Shiyuan Clan wouldn’t kill An Nanjing. So long as he was alive, and those three treasures were still in his possession, they wouldn’t touch her!

If he died, or if he lost those treasures, then An Nanjing may die. So, she was safe while he was safe.

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts, sat down cross-legged, and entered the Primordial Pagoda.

Fortifying his cultivation!

The important matter at hand was to fortify his cultivation and get used to the Progenitor Realm! During this period, Yang Ye’s aura kept fluctuating between strong and weak. It was extremely unstable, and it continued for three days before Yang Ye’s aura gradually calmed down.

Once he fortified his cultivation, Yang Ye went to the Bodhi Tree.

Yang Ye sat cross-legged before it and spoke softly, “I want to kill!”

The Bodhi Tree trembled abruptly.

Yang Ye chuckled, “No reason. I just want to kill.”

Meanwhile, a sword howl resounded, and then the Sword Supreme appeared before Yang Ye.

She gazed at Yang Ye for a long time and said, “The Slaughter Dao is against the Heaven Dao. Since the ancient times, it never ends well for those who are fond of killing.”

“The Heaven Dao?” Yang Ye chuckled, “Tell me, what is the Heaven Dao?”

“The will of the heavens!” The Sword Supreme spoke solemnly, “An unseen force that determines everything, you…”

Yang Ye shook his head, “Let me just ask you something. Now, they want to kill me, slaughter my loved ones, annihilate my friends, and take my treasures. Can you ask that so-called will of the heavens to put them in their place and uphold justice?”

The Sword Supreme fell silent.

Yang Ye walked over to her, and then he touched her face gently, “In life, not to mention the ethereal concept of the will of weapons, even the ones closest to us may not help us. We can only rely on ourselves.”

Yang Ye closed his eyes slowly at this point, “Slaughter is the way to survive. I choose to slaughter because it can make me even stronger, and it will allow me to live better. Besides that, I have no other choice. If I want to live, I must kill!”

A ray of red light suddenly appeared around Yang Ye, and then boundless slaughter intent surged out incessantly from him and coiled around his body.

The slaughter intent grew stronger and stronger, and it rose to the absolute peak of the Progenitor Realm, but it didn’t take long for this slaughter intent to vanish without a trace. It was like it had never been there.

A wisp of complicated emotions flashed through the Sword Supreme’s eyes, “Fortification of the Slaughter Dao and invisible intent. You’ve created your own Dao. Congratulations!”

Swoosh!

Suddenly, the Bodhi Tree enveloped Yang Ye. In an instant, everything Yang Ye had said and done were recorded by it.

A short while later, a few more words were added to the Bodhi Tree—The Dao of Carnage! Creator: Yang Ye.
