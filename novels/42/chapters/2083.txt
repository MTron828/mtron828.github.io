Chapter 2084 – It’s None of My Business!

Outside the city.

Yang Ye led Xiao Yue out of the city before he stopped, and then he gazed at her, “I’m sorry for dragging you down with me!”

She shook her head slightly, “I chose this!”

Even though she felt a slight sense of loss from losing her future career, she didn’t blame Yang Ye. Because what Yang Ye said that day was the only reason she’d been able to climb up the ranks. So, she couldn’t stand by idly when they were acting against him.

Yang Ye said, “Miss Xiao Yue, your talent in cultivation isn’t that good, but your management talent is quite good. I have a place that I can recommend you to. I wonder if you’re willing? Of course, I can guarantee that if you go there, you’ll definitely be given an important position that will let you reveal your talent.”

Xiao Yue gazed at Yang Ye.

Yang Ye smiled, “Perhaps it isn’t as huge as the Immortal Treasure Pavilion, but its potential is absolutely huge. Most importantly, you’ll get an important position there. Of course, I won’t stop you if you have a better place to go.”

She shook her head, “I don’t have anywhere else to go.”

Yang Ye said, “Then go now to the Human Dimension and look for Yang Lianshuang.”

He waved his right hand, and a black robed figure appeared by her side. It was the Major Zen Realm Sword Servant he’d refined. He’d refined two of them, and this was one of those two.

Xiao Yue thought for a moment and replied, “Alright. Right, you must be careful of that person who was investigating you. He may not let the matter rest.”

Yang Ye nodded, “I will. Travel safely!”

She didn’t say anything else. She just bowed to him and left.

Yang Ye glanced at the direction she left towards, and then he looked back at the city. He was about to leave when a voice resounded, “You’re leaving just like that?”

As soon as the voice finished resounding, a young man appeared not too far to Yang Ye’s right. The young man was around the age of 20. He looked handsome, and he held two crystal blue balls in his right grasp. There was an old man behind him, and the old man’s palms were hidden beneath his sleeves while his eyes remained closed.

Yang Ye gazed at the young man and said, “You’re the one who bought the Soulmend Casket, right?”

“Smart!” The young man walked slowly in Yang Ye’s direction, “Do you know that I wasted a precious opportunity because of you? It could have helped my clan do much more, but it’s gone because of you.”

Yang Ye chuckled, “So it’s my fault?”

The young man smiled, “Who else am I supposed to blame?”

Meanwhile, Yang Ye shrugged, “Allow me to be honest, we’re both men, so let’s just be straightforward. If you want to fight, then attack me. As for all that nonsense, just save it. I don’t have the time to waste on you. I can earn hundreds of thousands of immortal crystals in every breath of time!”

“Is that so?” The young man roared with laughter, “So, since I’ve wasted so much of your time, I should be compensating you for your losses?”

“Smart!” Yang Ye snapped his finger, “Too smart. This won’t end without at least a million immortal crystals!”

“How laughable!” Meanwhile, the old man suddenly spoke.

Yang Ye glanced at the old man, “You can notify your clan now.”

The old man opened his eyes and gazed at Yang Ye, and Yang Ye smiled, “I’m afraid there won’t be anyone to pay me!”

Yang Ye suddenly vanished on the spot.

At this moment, the old man’s eyes narrowed, and a solemn expression filled his eyes. At the same time, he vanished on the spot as well. He was in front of the young man when he appeared again, and a fist was already descending towards him. The powerful energy within the fist made him feel a wave of powerful pressure.

Meanwhile, the old man’s hands moved beneath his sleeves.

Swoosh! Swoosh!

Two rays of cold light shot towards Yang Ye’s fists. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Bang!

The old man’s figure was blasted away while Yang Ye stopped. He glanced at his hand, and there were two deep injuries on his fist. That wasn’t even the main point, the main point was that it was decaying rapidly.

Poison!

Yang Ye looked up at the old man, and the latter laughed coldly, “It’s a unique poison that kills anyone below the Sage Realm. You…”

His voice stopped abruptly while disbelief filled his eyes. It was because Yang Ye’s hand had recovered completely!

The old man stared at him, “Impossible…”

Meanwhile, Yang Ye had vanished on the spot.

Bang!

The old man was instantly blasted over 1km away. However, that wasn’t the end of it. Yang Ye appeared in front of him again, and then Yang Ye slammed another punch forward.

Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!

The young man watched as the old man was pushed back repeatedly and was practically incapable of fighting back.

The old man was completely suppressed.

The young man clenched his fists. He knew that he’d encountered someone formidable.

Bang!

Suddenly, the old man was slammed into the ground, and the entire ground trembled. The old man couldn’t stand up again because Yang Ye’s foot had stomped down on his back!

The old man wasn’t a Sage, and he was just a Major Zen Realm expert, but Major Zen Realm experts were no threat to Yang Ye. After all, he was at the peak of the Minor Zen Realm now. So, he could crush ordinary Major Zen Realm experts even without his sword.

Yang Ye didn’t kill the old man. He turned to look at the young man instead, “Is someone from your clan coming?”

The young man gazed at Yang Ye for a long time and said, “I was ignorant and didn’t know of your strength. Please…”

“One million!” Yang Ye raised a finger, “A million for your lives. If I don’t see a million in 10 minutes, then I’ll keep both your heads!”

The young man’s face turned icy cold, “I’m from the Li Clan, the Li Clan in the Sky Dimension…”

“Even the Sovereign of Sky won’t change anything!” Meanwhile, Yang Ye interrupted the young man, “You don’t have much time left. I’ll kill you if I don’t get my immortal crystals!”

“Such high-sounding sentiments!” Suddenly, a voice resounded, and then an old man appeared here with a cane in his hand.

A Sage!

It was a Sage!

The young man was visibly relieved when he saw the old man, and he hurriedly went over to the old man, “Grandfather!”

The old man glanced at him, “What an embarrassment!”

The young man didn’t dare to talk back, and he just lowered his head slightly. But his gaze glanced over at Yang Ye, and it was filled with resentment. He’d really suffered a huge loss today.

Meanwhile, the old man gazed at Yang Ye, “You don’t even take my Li Clan seriously, so I’m really curious why you’re so confident! Come, let me see what it is!”

Yang Ye removed his leg from the old man on the ground, “I didn’t expect Sages to be so ordinary like cabbages lately. They just keep appearing for every small thing. May I ask you something, how many Sages does the Li Clan have?”

“Why?” The old man spoke indifferently, “I’m not enough?”

Yang Ye chuckled, and then a sword appeared in his grasp. An instant later, a ray of light flashed, and the powerful sword energy cracked open the space in the surroundings. The sword energy instantly arrived in front of the old man, and the old man tapped it with his finger.

Bang!

The sword energy exploded apart. However, a sword stabbed against the tip of the old man’s finger.

Bang!

An explosion resounded, and the old man’s finger trembled violently while his figure moved over 30m back. Meanwhile, another sword tore through the air and slashed down at his head.

The old man slapped his palm upwards.

Boom!

Yang Ye was blasted away, but it only took an instant for three more swords to shoot at the old man.

Burial!

Judgment, the Sword Supreme, and Sword Fusion. This attack was so powerful that the ground in the surroundings was sliced up into countless pieces.

The old man’s eyes narrowed slightly while a rare trace of seriousness appeared in them.

The old man took a step forward, and then he tapped his cane forward. A ray of red light shot out from the tip of his cane.

Boom!

A loud explosion resounded, and the old man was pushed over 300m back. But that was it!

As for Yang Ye, he’d been pushed over 1km back, and an obvious wisp of scarlet red could be seen on the corner of his mouth.

However, Yang Ye was smiling.

A Sage!

Sages weren’t that far beyond reach to him anymore.

“The Sword Supreme!” Suddenly, the old man said, “It’s you!”

Yang Ye gazed at the old man, I’ve been recognized again?

But it made sense to him because the sword in his grasp was quite famous among Sages. It was the Sword Supreme, the Sword Supreme that once instilled fear in the god race!

Yang Ye was about to speak when the old man said, “There’s no enmity between you and my Li Clan, so why look for trouble with us?”

“No enmity?” Yang Ye pointed at the young man, “He didn’t hesitate to pay a huge price to make the Immortal Treasure Pavilion investigate me and even came to kill me. Is that what you call no enmity? I’m a person who repays kindness with kindness; and enmity with enmity. I’ll remember the Li Clan, and I’ll pay a visit to it in the future!”

He turned around and walked away.

Meanwhile, the old man said, “My Li Clan is linked to the Dao Path, we…”

“That’s none of my business!” Yang Ye turned around and gazed at the old man, “In any case, I’m enemies with the whole world, so another Li Clan doesn’t make a difference. If worse comes to worse, I’ll just take you down with me. I…”

Suddenly, the old man said, “I’ll give you a million immortal crystals!”

Yang Ye was stunned, and then he smiled, “Oh, so you’re with the Dao Path. Oh my, guess we’re on the same side. It was all a misunderstanding, a misunderstanding…”
