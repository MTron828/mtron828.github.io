Chapter 2627

The Origin World.

At this moment, countless were trembling throughout the Origin World, including the extraordinary Destiny Realm experts.

The pressure was so strong that even the Destiny Realm experts had to bow before it.

Tian Xiu had stopped in midair as well. The four peak Destiny Realm experts before her had done the same. The old man who led the group had an extremely solemn expression on his face, or it could be described as fearful instead!

The middle aged man with the saber had a similarly solemn and fearful expression as well.

Tian Xiu glanced at the sky, and a wave of invisible energy rippled out of her. However, it was instantly suppressed upon coming into contact with the pressure!

Tian Xiu’s body gradually started to bend, both her waist and even her knees!

Tian Xiu looked up at the boundless sky while a ferocious expression appeared on her face.

A moment later, Tian Xiu forced her figure straight.

Meanwhile, the others before her weren’t able to accomplish that. Even the Divine Abode’s master, the Eternal Lord, the Soul Sect’s master, Mr. Jing, and Shui Wubian…

All of these extraordinary experts at the peak of the Destiny Realm were forced to lower their figures before the pressure.

They were naturally unwilling to do so, but they were being forced down!

As for Yang Ye and An Nanjing, their knees were halfway bent, and they were on the verge of kneeling.

However, they forcefully stopped themselves. Even if their bones had started to tremble and crack open, they still didn’t yield! Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

But the pressure was really too strong!

It was the most terrifying pressure Yang Ye had ever seen!

Along with its arrival, a rare period of silence appeared throughout the Origin World.

Because everyone was being suppressed!

No!

There were exceptions, like Qi Bitian and Snowy.

Snowy and the countless sprites behind her weren’t affected. The pressure didn’t try to suppress them at all. As for Qi Bitian, while the pressure didn’t try to suppress her, something invisible had locked onto her!

Of course, Qi Bitian didn’t mind.

Snowy glanced at the surroundings, and then she gazed at Qi Bitian.

Qi Bitian sized up Snowy and cracked a smile, “I’m Qi Bitian.”

Snowy blinked and stretched out a paw.

She knew that Qi Bitian was on their side!

Qi Bitian grinned and took Snowy’s paw.

Qi Bitian sized up Snowy and said, “It wasn’t easy for you to grow to this current extent. So work harder to grow beyond the Sprite Progenitor and recover your original form. At that time, a word from you can take fortune from the world. In short, you’ll be very, very formidable.”

Snowy blinked and kept nodding.

She wanted to become formidable too!

Only then could she protect Yang Ye, An Nanjing, Erya, and the others!

Qi Bitiain grinned and rubbed Snowy’s head. After that, she gazed at Yang Ye’s stomach, or to be more precise, she was looking at Erya within the Primordial Pagoda. She waved her right hand lightly, and then a strand of invisible energy sealed off the Primordial Pagoda.

After all, Qi Bitian looked up at the sky with a trace of worry in her eyes, “I hope it’s enough to get through this!”

Meanwhile, the space above the Origin World cracked open, and then the pressure throughout the Origin World grew stronger!

Stronger and stronger!

Countless experts couldn’t hold on much longer and fell to the ground.

However, something worth mentioning was that those below the Destiny Realm weren’t affected at all!

The pressure was only aimed at experts in the Destiny Realm or above it!

The Desolate Emperor glanced at the surroundings and was about to leave, but Qi Bitian spoke abruptly, “What? You’re not staying to watch?”

The Desolate Emperor glanced at her, “It’s not like I’ve never met her.”

Qi Bitian nodded slightly, “True. Unfortunately, she has locked onto you, so you’ll never escape.”

Qi Bitian looked up at a point in sky and smiled, “You too.”

She was naturally speaking about the mysterious expert who hadn’t attacked earlier!

The Desolate Emperor’s face was extremely unsightly because the situation had developed beyond his expectations. Previously, no matter what happened, he could escape without suffering any harm, but now, it was impossible to just retreat.

Because something had locked onto him, so no matter where he went, it didn’t make a difference!

If he returned to the Desolate World, he would just be dragging the desolate race down with him!

He wasn’t the only one, all the other Destiny Realm experts here had something locked onto them!

The Desolate Emperor seemed to have thought of something and suddenly gazed at Yang Ye, “Wait! He isn’t at the Destiny Realm…”

Qi Bitian replied indifferently, “His slaughter intent is.”

The Desolate Emperor was stunned, and then he glanced at Yang Ye with slight pity in his eyes, “You’re probably going to suffer.”

As he spoke, he glanced at Snowy. At this moment, Snowy was ceaselessly sending spirit energy and World Energy into Yang Ye, but it didn’t change anything.

Snowy gazed anxiously at Qi Bitian and Tian Xiu, and Qi Bitian said softly, “It’s alright. It may even be beneficial to him. After all, if he can resist this pressure, it’ll be extremely beneficial to him.”

Tian Xiu glanced at Yang Ye and looked up at the sky. Rays of dark light were ceaselessly rippling out of her to resist the powerful pressure that was appearing out of thin air.

Tian Xiu asked softly, “Is she here?”

Qi Bitian nodded slightly, “I just don’t know which one of her it is!”

Tian Xiu frowned slightly and gazed at Qi Bitian with bewilderment.

Suddenly, the Desolate Emperor’s figure shook. He tore open the space before him while the powerful pressure around him was instantly obliterated by a wave of powerful energy!

Once he wasn’t bound by it anymore, the Desolate Emperor’s figure gradually turned ethereal!

Everyone else gazed at the Desolate Emperor.

Cang Hua had a wisp of ridicule on the corners of his mouth, “So what if you’re extraordinarily strong?”

Everyone understood that the Desolate Emperor was trying to forcefully remove the thing which had locked onto him.

However, it only took a moment for him to return to normal, and his face was rather unsightly.

He’d failed!

The Desolate Emperor gazed at Qi Bitian, and the latter spoke indifferently, “If you haven’t been discovered by her, then you may be able to escape like that. Yet now, you’ve been discovered, so even if you escape Three Dimensional Space, it wouldn’t change anything. Because she transcended Three Dimensional Space a long time ago. No, she can even enter Four Dimensional Space. Can you? If you can, then you can escape her.”

The Desolate Emperor replied indifferently, “Are we supposed to just wait here for her to pass judgment on us?”

Qi Bitian shrugged, “Do you have another choice?”

The Desolate Emperor had an indifferent expression on his face, and no one knew what he was thinking.

He'd really overdone it this time, and he couldn’t escape now.

Suddenly, the mysterious person hiding in some point in space spoke abruptly, “Abyss Lord, if I’m not wrong, you’re her main target!”

Everyone gazed at Qi Bitian!

The main target!

Qi Bitian smiled, “What? You want me to fight her so you can escape?”

The others remained silent.

Qi Bitian shook her head, “That is true. I am her main target, but you may not be aware of something. She would rather kill the wrong target than let anyone escape. She kills anyone at the Destiny Realm. As for the reason? Don’t ask me. I’ve only fought her but never had a chat with her.”

Mr. Jing spoke abruptly, “Why don’t you fight her again?”

Qi Bitian shook her head, “I fight her and you flee? Old man, are you an idiot? No wait, even idiots wouldn’t say something that stupid!”

Mr. Jing glanced coldly at her but remained silent.

What could he do? He was no match for her!

Tian Xiu spoke abruptly, “What do you plan to do?”

Qi Bitian withdrew her gaze and glanced at Tian Xiu, “If… If a mishap occurs, take them and leave. Don’t let her notice Snowy and Erya’s presence. They are still weak and haven’t fully awakened, so they won’t be able to fight back against her.”

Tian Xiu frowned slightly, “Snowy is the Sprite Progenitor…”

Qi Bitian shook her head, “Good and bad make no difference to her. It’s absolutely meaningless to her.”

Tian Xiu wanted to say more. Suddenly, the sound of bones breaking resounded from Yang Ye and An Nanjing.

Tian Xiu frowned slightly and was about to help, but Qi Bitian stopped her, “Let them endure it. It’s very beneficial to them.”

Tian Xiu nodded slightly and didn’t do anything.

Suddenly, the pressure in the surroundings vanished.

However, the entire Origin World started to tremble madly.

At this moment, all the experts in the Origin World looked up at the sky.

Hiss!

Suddenly, space was torn open, and a blood red figure walked out slowly from within space.

Bang!

The Origin World shook, and then it instantly turned ethereal!

It could endure it!

It couldn’t endure the figure at all!

The figure started walking down, and it grew increasingly clearer as it moved. It didn’t take long for everyone to see the figure’s appearance clearly.

A woman!

It was a woman!

A woman who was indescribably gorgeous!

Yang Ye was stunned when he saw her.

He’d seen her before. It was the woman he’d met near the Eternal River in Eternal Border, the woman who’d told him that Executor was called Heaven Executor!

One!

The woman who called herself One!
