Chapter 2534 – The Lord Realm!

At this moment, Yang Ye was even more certain that there was a mole in the Ancient Sword Sect!

Was it Elder Xue?

The first person he suspected was Elder Xue. But it didn’t take long for him to reject that thought.

His instinct told him that Elder Xue would never do this!

If it wasn’t Elder Xue, then was it the Grand Elder? Or perhaps one of the elite disciples?

It was quite impossible. These elite disciples had no prior knowledge of his intent to come here. Moreover, it was very difficult for them to send a message right under his nose!

A short while later, Yang Ye shook his head and stopped thinking about it. He looked up into the clouds, and he saw a thin old man there.

The old man was simply emaciated, but his eyes were extremely sharp!

The old man stood in the clouds and looked down at Yang Ye, “I heard you didn’t want any experts of the Ancient Sword Sect to follow you here!”

Yang Ye smiled, “You’re even aware of that! Amazing!”

The old man replied indifferently, “I know even more. For example, you’re from Eternal Border. Right?”

Yang Ye smiled, “I’m a little curious about something. Did you merely put some people in the Ancient Sword Sect, or do you have people in the other large powers and even Eternal Border?”

The old man replied, “What do you think?”

Yang Ye replied, “Needless to say, I underestimated your Soul Sect.”

The old man replied, “In the beginning, we underestimated you a little too. Now, I’ve come myself. So, even if you die, you should feel honored!”

Suddenly, two flying swords soundlessly appeared on both sides of the old man!

However, they hadn’t even gotten near him when two pitch black hands grabbed them!

The old man laughed coldly, “I knew your flying swords are formidable, so I took precautions. You…”

Suddenly, the old man’s voice stopped abruptly, and then he vanished on the spot.

Hiss!

A rift was cut open in space where the old man had been a moment ago. It had been cut open by a sword!

Eternal Light!

The old man stared at Yang Ye for over 1km away, “I didn’t expect you to have one more sword. If I hadn’t been vigilant, I would have been tricked by you!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he tapped his finger forward. In an instant, a pitch black umbrella floated above Yang Ye, and then a strand of powerful energy rippled out from the umbrella. The energy caused the space around Yang Ye to surge!

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly, and then he issued a command in his heart. Two flying swords shot at the umbrella, but they were bounced away before they could even get close!

They couldn’t get close to it at all!

Meanwhile, strands of powerful energy rippled down.

Qing Yue and the others were about to take action, but Yang Ye was faster. A ray of brilliant sword energy surged up into the air, and it blocked off the powerful energy coming from the umbrella.

But it didn’t take long for the sword energy to gradually start being dispersed.

Meanwhile, the old man slapped his palm down!

Bang!

The entire city shook, and then the space around Yang Ye rippled while waves of powerful energy rippled out from the space around him!

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings. The energy around him was absolutely beyond the limits of his body’s defenses!

Once it got close to him, he would be obliterated!

Yang Ye didn’t dare to continue concealing his strength. So, he took a step forward, and a wave of mysterious energy enveloped the surroundings!

The Sword Domain!

Once the Sword Domain appeared, the energy in the surroundings suddenly stopped. Meanwhile, a sword soundlessly slashed the black umbrella.

Bang!

The umbrella was blasted away!

At the same time, two flying swords shot at the emaciated old man. This time, their speed and strength was beyond anything he’d displayed before this point in the battle.

The old man was shocked by this, and he flashed away from where he stood. But those two swords were truly too fast!

Hiss! Hiss!

They pierced through his chest!

However, Yang Ye frowned because the old man’s body suddenly exploded apart, and then the entire Sword Domain was filled with countless strands of black energy!

The black energy had enveloped the entire area within the Sword Domain!

A short while later, the entire Sword Domain shook as if it was about to explode!

Yang Ye frowned, and then a sword appeared in his grasp!

Executor!

Yang Ye swung Executor forward!

11 overlapped swings with the Sword Domain!

As soon as the final swing descended, the black energy throughout the Sword Domain was instantly dispersed. At the same time, a black figure was blasted away!

It was the old man!

After it was enhanced by the Sword Domain, that attack had blasted the old man out of the black energy!

Once the old man was blasted away, he immediately flashed out of Yang Ye’s Sword Domain. However, Yang Ye was extremely fast and immediately appeared before the old man!

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!

Three flying swords shot forward first. Because the Sword Domain was active, their speed was so fast that even the old man at the Lord Realm couldn’t dodge them and was forced to go head-on against them!

A wisp of ghastly killing intent flashed through the old man’s eyes. Suddenly, he waved his right hand, and the black umbrella appeared once more and instantly enveloped him.

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!

Meanwhile, the flying swords arrived!

However, the flying swords failed to pierce through the umbrella. The umbrella was a Divine Treasure too, and it was very difficult for a Divine Treasure to destroy another Divine Treasure!

However, another sword suddenly struck the black umbrella!

As soon as this attack descended, the umbrella shook violently, and a shrill cry came from within it. After that, the umbrella exploded apart and transformed into fragments of energy that scattered through the air!

As for the old man, he was blasted flying!

Multiple mouthfuls of blood sprayed from the old man in midair, and there was disbelief in his eyes!

He was at the Lord Realm, and his strength and every other aspect had an absolute advantage over Yang Ye. However, after a few collisions, he realized that even if he used everything he had, he was still unable to do anything to Yang Ye!

Moreover, Yang Ye’s three flying swords and the sword Yang Ye held were truly too terrifying!

The old man naturally recognized the sword Yang Ye held!

It was the number one sword of Eternal Kingdom!

The desire to retreat had arisen within the old man, and as soon as that happened, he didn’t hesitate to decisively flee toward the sky!

However, how could Yang Ye allow him to escape?

Two flying swords shot up into the air, and then they instantly appeared before the old man and stopped him from escaping!

The old man was about to attack when a sword shot down from above him!

Executor!

The old man was horrified by the sight of this sword. At the critical moment, he disregarded everything and crushed a black talisman. In an instant, an ethereal figure appeared before him, and then it gently tapped its finger at Yang Ye!

Bang!

As soon as the finger descended, the space above the city shook, and then Yang Ye was blasted away like a cannonball. Moreover, his flying swords were instantly blasted over 500 km away. However, they had spirits of their own and immediately returned to the Sword Gourd!

Yang Ye wiped the blood off the corner of his mouth and looked over into the distance. The old man was still standing there, and there was an ethereal figure standing before the old man. Yang Ye couldn’t discern the appearance of the figure!

The figure faced Yang Ye while the old man behind it stared at Yang Ye and said, “Ye Yang, we’ll meet again very soon.”

He vanished into the sky once he finished speaking.

At this moment, the old man’s heart hurt terribly. That ethereal figure was a trump card of his that the higher-ups had given him. He only had a single chance to use it. Yet now, he’d used it! Not only had he used it, he hadn’t been able to complete his mission. So, it could be said that he’d lost everything and gained nothing!

In the sky above the city, Yang Ye glanced coldly at the ethereal figure, and it remained silent and gradually vanished once the old man had vanished.

Meanwhile, Qing Yue and the others hurriedly went over to Yang Ye, and they were inwardly relieved when they saw that he was alright.

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings, and his Sword Domain enveloped the city. He could sense everything in the city with absolute clarity!RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Suddenly, Yang Ye said, “Come with me!”

As soon as he gave the order, Yang Ye appeared within the city and walked off into the distance. It didn’t take long for them to arrive at a corner of the city, and their expressions changed upon arriving there!

There were countless corpses piled up in the corner. They were in layers that rose up in the dozens! All of them had no injuries on them!

Their souls were gone!

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings, “Go take a look!”

The sword cultivators behind him immediately vanished on the spot, and they returned to him a short while later.

One of them spoke solemnly, “All the corners of the walls have piles like this. They should be the residents of the city, and all of them have had their souls extracted!”

Yang Ye looked up at the sky, “What are they trying to do?!”

Meanwhile, Qing Yue spoke abruptly, “They may do the same to other cities!”

Yang Ye was about to say something when the space before him shook, and then Elder Xue’s voice came from there. A short while later, Yang Ye’s face turned gloomy!
