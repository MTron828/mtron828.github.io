Chapter 2160 – I’m His Father!

As soon as he finished speaking, a few Sages appeared before the armless man. The Sage who led the group was about to speak when the armless man vanished on the spot, and then that Sage lost his head!

An instant later, the armless man stomped his right foot down.

Boom! Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

In an instant, the entire Buddhist Dimension shook violently, and countless temples were instantly obliterated!

The entire Buddhist Dimension was filled with shock!

All the experts of the Buddhist Path gazed in the armless man’s direction!

The armless man glanced at the surroundings. Suddenly, a golden lotus appeared in front of him, and the Buddhist Progenitor was on it.

The Buddhist Progenitor spoke solemnly, “You!”

He naturally recognized the armless man before him. The Buddhist Path had started investigating as soon as the armless man had first shown himself.

The current dean of Martial Emperor Academy!

The armless man walked over to the Buddhist Progenitor, “The great ancestor of the Buddhist Path actually went personally to deal with a junior at the Major Zen Realm. Don’t you feel ashamed?”

The Buddhist Progenitor asked, “Who are you?”

“Who am I?” The armless man shook his head, “That’s none of your business. I’m here because I want an answer from you. Can you not target Yang Ye anymore?”

The Buddhist Progenitor replied indifferently, “What if I refuse?”

The armless man smiled, “That’s fine. From this moment onward, the Buddhist Path will be an enemy of my Martial Emperor Academy. Moreover, from this moment onward, I’ll annihilate everyone in the Buddhist Dimension besides you. Want to try me?”

The Buddhist Progenitor’s eyes narrowed slightly, “Are you threatening me?”

The armless man nodded, “I am!”

The atmosphere here instantly seemed like it had frozen.

Anyone would be furious when facing the overbearing actions of the armless man. Suddenly, a golden palm appeared in front of the armless man. As soon as that happened, the surroundings changed. At this moment, they were in an unknown expanse of space, but the golden palm was still there. Moreover, countless planets in the surroundings suddenly exploded apart, and they transformed into countless rays of starlight that shot over from deep within the universe!

The armless man’s expression remained indifferent as he took a step forward. In an instant, a strand of bright red blood seeped out from within him, and then the armless man’s hair instantly turned crimson red. At the same time, his eyes had turned crimson red.

It wasn’t slaughter intent, and there was a huge difference between his current appearance and the changes in appearance that Yang Ye had just experienced!

Meanwhile, the Buddhist Progenitor’s eyes narrowed slightly, “Bloodline Power…”

Boom!

As soon as he finished speaking, a wave of powerful energy swept out from the armless man. In an instant, the space here shattered.

The armless man and the Buddhist Progenitor appeared in the Buddhist Dimension again. At this moment, the armless man had opened his eyes, and two balls of blood were burning in them. At the same time, the entire Buddhist Dimension had turned ethereal.

In an instant, everyone here sensed an extraordinary wave of pressure!

Meanwhile, the Buddhist Progenitor said, “You’ve won!”

As soon as he said that, the armless man returned to normal. He glanced at the Buddhist Progenitor and said, “Besides you, everyone else in the Buddhist Path can act against him. If he dies, he can only blame his weakness and lack of ability. However, if an old fellow like you who has lived for countless years acts against him, then it isn’t his weakness or lack of ability that caused his death, it was… was my lack of ability. I’ll repeat myself. If you act against him, then while I can’t do anything to you, annihilating all your disciples is absolutely easy.”

He turned around and left once he finished speaking.

The Buddhist Progenitor’s face was extremely gloomy. He naturally didn’t fear the armless man, he just had too many things to worry about. He didn’t want to fight the armless man to the death in such a situation, so he’d chosen to make a compromise.

It was a little insulting, but he had no other choice. If he didn’t, they would fight to the death, and all his efforts would be wasted.

A long time passed before the Buddhist Progenitor glanced up into the sky, “Brother Dao, you still made the better move!”

…

.

Meanwhile, the armless man arrived before the Dao Progenitor.

The Dao Progenitor sized up the armless man, “He made a compromise?”

The armless man nodded.

The Dao Progenitor smiled, “Both of you are very outstanding. Did you drag me into this because you wanted to use me to fight against that person?”

The armless man shook his head, “I never intended that. I forcefully sent that pagoda into him merely because I wanted that pagoda to help conceal him from the workings of the heavens, so that person won’t notice him so soon. Unfortunately, he was noticed in the end. He successfully stepped on the path of the Sword Dao and joined the sect founded by that person. Sigh, what a headache. I’ve never been convinced of anyone’s superiority in my life, but I have to admire his natural talent. His natural talent and comprehension are something that no one besides the Void Spirit Maiden can compete with in this large universe!”

“Your natural talent and comprehension aren’t inferior!” The Dao Progenitor continued, “The only thing you lack is that you’re too loyal. If you can give up that kid and his mother, then based on the natural talent and potential you possess, you wouldn’t be any weaker than him. At most times, those without emotion have a greater advantage over those with emotion!”

The armless man shook his head and said, “The problem is, that person isn’t the only one, and there are so many other organizations. But that fellow just happens to have been swept into all of them. He’s such a pain. Especially the Nether Pavilion. It really puzzles me how even an organization like the Nether Pavilion is linked to him. It’s quite a headache to deal with. Besides that, the god race isn’t ordinary either, and there’s the prehistoric race too!”

He shook his head at this point, “It’s such a mess of mysterious organizations, yet all of them are linked to him. He isn’t that strong, but he’s truly amazing when it comes to causing trouble!”

The Dao Progenitor smiled and spoke seriously, “Where’s that person?”

The armless man fell silent for a moment and replied, “After he defeated the Martial Emperor, he noticed that there were some flaws in his Sword Dao, so he entered a temporal tunnel. Presently, he’s using the temporal tunnel to perfect his emotionless Sword Dao.”

The Dao Progenitor spoke softly, “Even the Martial Emperor was defeated?”

The armless man nodded, “They competed in three rounds. The first round, they used no profound energy and merely competed in the basics. The Martial Emperor lost. In the second round, they fought with their true strength, and the Martial Emperor still lost. While his Sword Dao has a lethal flaw, the problem is who in this world can even break through that flaw? I know what his flaw is, and the Martial Emperor knows it too, but no one can do anything to it. That’s what makes him so formidable. His flaw is right there, but you can’t do anything to him!”

The Dao Progenitor nodded slightly, “While his Sword Dao lacks emotion, he has brought his emotionlessness to the extreme. No matter what it is, it would be extremely terrifying to bring anything to its extreme, even the smallest thing. He succeeded.”

The armless man nodded, “Indeed. After he defeated the Martial Emperor, he will only treat himself as his opponent!”

The Dao Progenitor asked, “What was the third round?”

The armless man replied, “They discussed the Dao. This time, the Martial Emperor barely won. As for the reason, it was because his Sword Dao had a flaw. However, that doesn’t change anything. Because his Sword Dao may have a flaw, but his strength has none.”

The Dao Progenitor suddenly asked, “Will he do that?”

The armless man fell silent for a long time, and then he replied, “It’s very likely. After all, he’s just a step away now. If he succeeds, then even the Void Spirit Maiden who was invincible throughout the entire universe would be no match for him.”

“The Void Spirit Maiden!” The Dao Progenitor spoke softly, “She’s extraordinary indeed!”

The armless man asked, “Do you know how she died all those years ago? According to the records in my academy, she was so strong that she transcended the universe. Even if the entire universe was obliterated in an instant, it wouldn’t harm her at all. If someone killed her, then isn’t that person a little too strong?”

The Dao Progenitor shook his head slightly, “That part of history is a blank slate for us. The void spirit race was once the overlord of the large universe, and it should have left a lot of history behind. However, it’s a blank slate. Even if I entered the river of history, I wasn’t able to find anything.”

He gazed at the armless man and continued, “So, is everything you’ve been doing in secret been worth it? If you didn’t have all these ties, you would have achieved more, and you wouldn’t have lost your arms.”

The armless man smiled, “Is it worth it? If you aren’t shackled by the Dao Path, then based on your comprehension ability and strength, you would have gone a level higher like that guy from the Confucianist Path, right? Was it worth it to suppress your own cultivation for the Dao Path?”

The Dao Progenitor smiled when he heard this.

Both he and the armless man had a flaw, and it was the ties they had.

They couldn’t really do as they pleased while these ties shackled them, and so they couldn’t reach the limits of their potential.

However, the person they spoke about had no such ties. That person could do as he pleased and had abandoned everything. So, that person’s Sword Dao had arrived at its limits.

Meanwhile, the Dao Progenitor suddenly asked, “What do you plan to do after this?”

The armless man fell silent for a short while, and then he said, “What else can I do? I have to continue keeping them busy, and give that kid more time to grow. As for the god race, Nether Pavilion, and prehistoric race, the End Times hasn’t really arrived yet, so they probably won’t take action yet.”

The Dao Progenitor said, “It won’t be long!”

The armless man looked down, and he looked right at Yang Ye.

He remained silent for a long time, and then he spoke softly, “I’ll let go once he attains the Progenitor Realm. His mother is probably getting old waiting for me. I owe him, but I owe his mother more. I owe her too much.”

The Dao Progenitor frowned slightly, “Is it worth it?”

The armless man replied, “It can’t be helped. I’m his father and not the other way around!”
