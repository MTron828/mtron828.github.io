Chapter 2512 – Departure!

A Five World Realm expert had been killed in an instant!

Everyone gazed at Yang Ye with shock. This young man who was only at the Three World Realm had actually killed a Five World Realm expert in an instant!

A Five World Realm expert!

While the Five World Realm expert had lost his head, his soul had been able to escape at the critical moment.

He gazed at Yang Ye while shock filled his eyes!

That attack had been extremely swift!

So swift that he hadn’t been able to react!

How could a Three World Realm sword cultivator possibly attack so quickly?!

The old man wasn’t the only one, the elder from the Leng Clan couldn’t maintain his calm either. They’d lost a Five World Realm expert before this, but they didn’t think it was Yang Ye’s work.

After all, Yang Ye had just been at the Two World Realm then!

A Two World Realm expert killing a Five World Realm expert!

That was nonsense!

However, the facts before him proved that this young man really could kill Five World Realm experts, and he could do it in an instant!

Yang Ye walked over to Ye Ruxuan and said, “I’m not done.”

Yang Ye gazed at the black robed figure and continued, “As a member of the Ye Clan, I should be allowed to say a few words here, right?”

The black robed figure fell silent for a moment and replied, “Yes!”

The expression of the Leng Clan’s elder instantly turned extremely unsightly.

That was no different than an acknowledgment of Yang Ye’s identity!

Of course, it was normal. Not to mention the Ye Clan, even the Leng Clan would admit it without the slightest hesitation!

How monstrous did someone have to be in order to kill a Five World Realm expert at the Three World Realm? Moreover, it was a sword cultivator too!

If a clan had the protection of an extraordinary sword cultivator, then how terrifying would that be?

After all, sword cultivators were usually much, much stronger than ordinary cultivators, and this young man was a sword and body cultivator!

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings, and everyone was looking at him. Their gazes at him were completely different now!

Yang Ye seemed to have thought of something and shook his head, “I don’t feel like saying anything anymore. I, Ye Yang, am a member of the Ye Clan, but not really.”

He gazed at Ye Zhibei and continued, “Miss Zhibei, no matter what, I still have to thank you. I have something to say that you can consider. Try your best to make life better for all your clansmen and reduce the amount of injustice.”

He turned around and walked away once he finished speaking.

However, he turned around and glanced at the elder from the Leng Clan once he arrived at the door, “I, Ye Yang, am a disciple of the Ancient Sword Sect, so if your clan wants revenge, then come find me at the Ancient Sword Sect whenever you want!”

“Haha!” Suddenly, roaring laughter came from far away in the sky, and then a ray of sword energy shot through the sky and an old man appeared high above.

A Lord Realm sword cultivator!

The old man glanced at Yang Ye, “You’re the inner court disciple, Yang Ye?”

Yang Ye nodded.

The old man said, “I’m the Grand Elder of the Ancient Sword Sect, the one with the greatest authority beneath the Sect Master. Now, I proclaim that you, Ye Yang, are officially an elite disciple of my Ancient Sword Sect. If any Lord Realm expert dares to act against you, it’s an act of aggression against the Ancient Sword Sect. Even if you’re assassinated, my Ancient Sword Sect will have its revenge.”

He was clearly saying it for the elder from the Leng Clan.

Suddenly, the black robed figure behind Ye Zhibei said, “Elder Leng, go home. Tell your patriarch that Ye Yang is a member of my Ye Clan, and my Ye Clan will be responsible for his actions. From this moment onward, Ye Yang is a core disciple of my Ye Clan, and his status is merely inferior to Zhibei while his treatment will be the same.”

Elder Leng fell silent for a short while and left.

The Grand Elder of the Ancient Sword Sect smiled, “Kid, let’s go!”

“Where are you going?” Meanwhile, the black robed figure appeared before the Grand Elder, “He’s a disciple of my Ye Clan, so he should naturally stay here.”

The Grand Elder glanced at the black robed figure, “Your Ye Clan is being a little shameless. Earlier, you didn’t want an illegitimate child from a branch family like him, and you planned to give him to the Leng Clan for a favor. Now that you’ve seen his talent, you’re acknowledging him instead? How can you be so shameless?”

The black robed figure replied indifferently, “He has the blood of the Ye Clan within him, so he’s a member of my Ye Clan.”

The Grand Elder replied, “He’s an elite disciple of my Ancient Sword Sect right now!”

The black robed figure refused to back down, “He’s a core disciple of my Ye Clan!”

They seemed to be on the verge of fighting.

Meanwhile, Ye Zhibei stepped forward, “He’s a disciple of the Ancient Sword Sect and a member of my Ye Clan. There is no conflict there!”

No conflict!

The Grand Elder frowned slightly. There were members of all the clans in the Ancient Sword Sect. So, there really wasn’t any conflict. After all, they were in peaceful times right now, so the Ancient Sword Sect would never go to war with any of the clans.

After all, the desolate race was out there!

After pondering deeply for a moment, the Grand Elder gazed at Yang Ye, “What do you think, kid?”

Yang Ye smiled, “I’m an elite disciple of the Ancient Sword Sect.”

The Grand Elder nodded slightly upon hearing this, “Good. Of course, you’re a member of the Ye Clan too. My Ancient Sword Sect doesn’t have such strict requirements, and even if it does, we can make an exception for you.”

An exception!

Once they were certain that Yang Ye had gone to the Ye Clan with Ye Zhibei, the Ancient Sword Sect had immediately sent him. Because the Ancient Sword Sect knew about some of the incidents in the War Dimension.

This inner court disciple of theirs was much more monstrous than they’d imagined!

They couldn’t let him go!

The Grand Elder said, “Do you want to return to the sect with me right now?”

Yang Ye was about to agree when Ye Zhibei spoke abruptly, “He has to return to the War Dimension!”

The War Dimension!

The Grand Elder pondered deeply for a moment and nodded, “True!”

Yang Ye gazed at Ye Zhibei, “Why?”

She replied, “We only have three days. If we don’t return in three days, the consequences will be severe.”

Yang Ye frowned as he wasn’t aware of such rules!

He didn’t want to return to the War Dimension. He just wanted to return to the Ancient Sword Sect and help Sword Scroll get back her main body.

Yang Ye wanted to say more, but Ye Zhibei suddenly sent him a voice transmission, “The rules of the War Dimension cannot be broken. Otherwise, it’s very likely that you’ll be removed from the War Dimension, and they may even request the Ancient Sword Sect to expel you. It’s not a place that anyone can enter and leave as they please. Even the Xing Clan’s Xing Biqing has to obey those rules. If you want to leave, you can use other methods to accomplish that. But you must return with me for now.”

Yang Ye glanced at her, and she seemed absolutely serious!

Yang Ye felt quite speechless. In the end, he nodded.

He was an elite disciple of the Ancient Sword Sect now, so he wasn’t in that much of a rush.

The Grand Elder gave Yang Ye a golden talisman before leaving on his sword. As for the Ye Clan, it immediately got him an abode in the city. Moreover, they sent him a spatial ring too. Within it was a Lord Realm inner core and 150 World Crystals!

According to Ye Zhibei, it was what core disciples received, and they received it twice a year!

It was very abundant!

Yang Ye didn’t refuse it and took it all. The Ye Clan wouldn’t be willing to let him refuse anyway!

The day before they left, Ye Zhibei brought Yang Ye to a mountain wall at the rear mountains of the Ye Clan. An old man was seated cross-legged there, and he had his back to them.

Ye Zhibei bowed slightly to the old man and gazed at Yang Ye, “The Ye Clan’s ancestor. He wanted to meet you!”

Meet me?

Yang Ye gazed at the old man. Meanwhile, the old man spoke abruptly, “Your foundation is very strong and solid. You’re suppressing your cultivation!”

Suppressing his cultivation!

Yang Ye nodded, “I am!”

The old man said, “Earlier, you said that clans regard its interests as the most important. You think that is wrong?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “As far as I’m concerned, it is wrong, but others think it is right.”

The old man asked, “Why do you think it’s wrong?”

Yang Ye replied, “If a clan only considers everything based on its own interests, it would lack familial bonds and emotions. A clan like that is icy cold, and its clansmen will have no sense of belonging or pride for the clan. Most importantly, how we do things and what we do will always be done based on benefits and interests. Of course, there is a benefit to this, and it will allow the clan to remain prosperous. However, such a clan is too icy cold. Just like me, I have no sense of belonging to the Ye Clan, and as far as I’m concerned, it doesn’t matter whether I’m part of the Ye Clan!”

Ye Zhibei glanced at him and remained silent.𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

The old man remained silent for a long time before he said, “You’re very frank. Zhibei is very young, and she can’t deter some people. So, help her. Both of you can decide what happens to the Ye Clan in the future.”

Yang Ye spoke solemnly, “I’m not interested in the Ye Clan! Or the Ancient Sword Sect!”

The old man said, “But you need us. You will have an invisible barrier of protection while you’re part of the Ye Clan and Ancient Sword Sect. Otherwise, the Leng Clan will immediately send a Lord Realm expert or even an expert above the Lord Realm to annihilate you.”

Yang Ye fell silent. Just as the old man had said, if the Leng Clan was determined to kill him, was his current strength enough to keep him alive?

Meanwhile, the old man continued, “As far as my Ye Clan is concerned, your disinterest toward the position of patriarch is a good thing. You don’t have to do much, just take Zhibei’s side when it’s required. In return for that, you’ll get the same resources that Zhibei receives. I’m sure the Ancient Sword Sect wants the same too. A clan needs a guardian. The Ancient Sword Sect needs one, and my Ye Clan needs one too. And you are perfect to play that role!”

Yang Ye fell silent. He didn’t refuse or agree.

After all, he was Yang Ye, not Ye Yang!

As for the old man, he left without saying another word.

Meanwhile, Ye Zhibei suddenly said, “Something has happened in the War Dimension! We must return immediately!”
