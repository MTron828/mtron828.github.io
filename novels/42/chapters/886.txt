Win others over with virtue? Jian Wuchen and the others shook their heads. After all, if Yang Ye won people over with virtue, then would anyone who did that even exist in this world?

They had no knowledge of Yang Ye’s past, but could anything Yang Ye did in Pine Prefecture be considered as trying to win others over with virtue? If those fellows whom he killed knew that he considered that to be winning them over with virtue, then one could only wonder if they would rise up from the dead!

Yang Ye suddenly asked, “Why do they want me to be an instructor there?” While there wasn’t any deep enmity between him and the Ocean of Clouds Academy, they could absolutely not be said to have a friendly relationship. After all, he’d killed numerous disciples of the academy. To a certain extent, he’d slapped the academy in the face!

Jian Wuchen remained silent for a while before he said, “Perhaps it’s related to White Deer Academy. No matter what, it’s absolutely beneficial to you and isn’t disadvantageous at all. If that old geezer has any requests of you, then don’t hold back at all and extort him for everything you can.”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“The Pagoda of Sword Intent is gone!” Suddenly, an old man appeared in front of Yang Ye. Yang Ye knew the old man because it was that fellow, Elder Xiao, who said that Yang Ye was one who loved to cause trouble.

The corners of Yang Ye’s eyes twitched. Is he trying to denounce me now? While he didn’t know Elder Xiao’s exact status in the sword school, he had no doubt that it was absolutely not low. Because even Jian Wuchen was rather respectful towards Elder Xiao.

“From now onward, it’ll be countless times more difficult for the disciples of our sword school to improve their sword intent!” Elder Xiao continued with a slightly gloomy tone, and it even carried a trace of faint rage.

Jian Wuchen was about to speak but Elder Xiao gazed at Yang Ye and said, “You did it, right?”

It was impossible to lie about, so Yang Ye nodded like a man and said, “Indeed!”

When he spoke up to this point, he gazed at Daoist Gu and said, “Master said that I could devour them as I pleased if I had the ability to do so....” After all, this matter was quite serious, so he couldn’t bear the responsibility for it on his own. So, he’d hastily dragged Daoist Gu down into it.

The corners of Daoist Gu’s mouth twitched, and then he gazed at Jian Wuchen and said, “The Sword Master is aware of this as well....” What a joke! Even he wasn’t able to bear the responsibility for this! After all, the Pagoda of Sword Intent was a paradise of cultivation for the disciples of the swords school. Now that it had been destroyed, there were definitely countless who were filled with resentment, and that even included those old fellows of the sword school. In any case, he didn’t want to become the common enemy of the entire sword school!

Jian Wuchen glanced at Yang Ye and Daoist Gu before he spoke, “I’m indeed aware of this. Right, the Founding Ancestor is aware as well. So, we’ll wait for the Founding Ancestor’s reply before we decide what is to be done!”

Everyone here rolled their eyes when they heard this. All of these 3 fellows are masters at pushing away the responsibility to others....

Elder Xiao glanced at Jian Wuchen and said, “Sword Master, there’s no need for that. Actually, I was quite surprised that he could devour all the sword intent there. Now that it has already come to this, I don’t intend to blame anyone. After all, he’s a disciple of our sword school at any rate. But it’s hardly justifiable to just give it to him like that, right?”

Jian Wuchen asked, “Elder Xiao, then what do you think we should do?”

“There are less than 3 years to the next Martial Rankings!’ Elder Xiao glanced at Yang Ye and continued, “We can forget this matter if he’s able to fight his way into the top 30. If he can’t, then it proves that giving the sword intent to him was a waste. So, I hope that Sword Master will punish him according to the rules of the sword school!”

Jian Wuchen pondered deeply for a moment before he gazed at Yang Ye and said, “What do you think?”

Only the top 30? Yang Ye waved his hand and said, “It’s only the top 30. It’s not a problem!” To be honest, after he absorbed all the sword intent and found out about its significance to the sword school, he felt quite guilty in his heart. After all, countless disciples needed it to improve their sword intent. Now that he’d absorbed it all, it represented that it would be countless times more difficult for them to improve their sword intent from now on!

So, he’d immediately agreed when Elder Xiao raised such a requirement. While he didn’t know what the Martial Rankings was, he felt that the top 30 shouldn’t be a problem for him!

“Only the top 30?” The corners of Elder Xiao’s mouth twitched. He took a deep breath and said, “Good! Very good! Remember what you’ve said! Don’t blame me for being merciless if you fail!”

“Elder Xiao, you seem to not hold any confidence in me!” Yang Ye continued, “Since it’s like that, why don’t we make a bet?”

“Do you think that I would fear you! Let’s bet if you want!” Elder Xiao spoke indifferently.

Yang Ye grinned, “How about this? If I’m able to ascend that rankings you speak of, then Elder Xiao must support me no matter what I do, alright?” The old man before him was definitely an extraordinary expert that might even be on par with Jian Wuchen. If he could get the old man to back him up, then it would be absolutely good news for him!

Elder Xiao glanced at Yang Ye and said, “If you’re able to fight your way into the top 30, then I’ll support you until the end even if you offend a Diamond Rank power! However, if you fail, then I’ll extract your sword intent and return it to the Pagoda of Sword Intent!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Elder Xiao’s figure flashed and vanished on the spot.

After that, the other elders gazed at Yang Ye and shook their heads.

Yang Ye was stunned. He gazed at Jian Wuchen and said, “Is it very difficult?”

Jian Wuchen spoke flatly, “It isn’t very difficult. It’s just open to Saints as well.”

Yang Ye’s face stiffened. What a joke! Even Saints could participate! Was I a little too full of myself when I said that I could when I only have 3 years...?

“Don’t worry. Old fellows like us are naturally unable to join!” Daoist Gu consoled him, “Saints can participate indeed. However, it’s only limited to those Innate Saints. In other words, only Saints below the age of 30 are allowed to participate. Not to mention our prefecture, there are very few of such existences even in the Central Divine Prefecture. So, you have a very good chance!”

Yang Ye laughed bitterly and said, “I hope so!”

Meanwhile, a golden piece of paper appeared before him while Jian Wuchen’s voice resounded, “This is your letter of appointment. Head to the academy with this and you can take up your new position there.”

Yang Ye’s gaze focused onto the paper, and he saw a row of words there, Outer Court Instructor.

“The Ocean of Clouds Academy is divided into the outer court, inner court, and secret court. Every single court has four classes differentiated by the alphabet from A to D. Practically all the disciples of the outer court are at the Exalt Realm or below while the inner court is filled with disciples at the Monarch Realm to the Half-Saint Realm. As for the secret court, I don’t know the strength of its students because it’s the most mysterious and strongest part of the academy!” said Jian Wuchen.

Yang Ye nodded and said, “Should I head there right now?”

Jian Wuchen grinned. Of course. After all, the academy’s outer court is in its recruitment period right now. In other words, your students will be new students. If you head over right now, then you can get to know them in advance. Remember what I said. Keep a low profile there and only display your ability when needed. After all, you represent the sword school now, and you can’t allow others to look down on our sword school!”

“Don’t worry, while I can’t guarantee anything else, I can guarantee that this kid will definitely not allow himself to suffer a loss!” Daoist Gu chuckled, “Kid, the Ocean of Clouds Academy is filled with experts, so don’t get in over your head. Most importantly, don’t lose to any disciple of the academy, otherwise both you and our sword school will be utterly humiliated!”

When he spoke up to this point, Daoist Gu flicked a scroll over to Yang Ye and said, “This is a map of the prefecture, and the location of the various powers throughout the prefecture are marked on it. Besides that, do you see those red dots? Those red dots mark places that are still very dangerous to you. So don’t go court death, alright?”

Yang Ye took the scroll and sighed with emotion in his heart. This is the benefit of belonging to a sect. Besides having their support and resources, I gain so much more that others aren’t able to obtain.

Yang Ye held the scroll as he bowed a little to Jian Wuchen and Daoist Gu, and then he left the hall.

Jian Wuchen watched Yang Ye walk out before he spoke abruptly, “I wonder what he experienced in the past. Did you feel it? While he has joined our swords school, he clearly carries a trace of resistance towards accepting the members of our sword school. Besides that, he does respect us, but there’s no fear in him when he faces us. Is he fearless for he is ignorant, or is it because he has some sort of terrifying trump card?”

Daoist Gu shook his head and said, “No matter what, that kid’s character is quite good. Just as he said, so long as we don’t betray him, then he won’t betray our sword school. That’s more than enough!”

Jian Wuchen spoke softly, “Right!”

...

Yang Ye didn’t head straight for the academy. He went to the Heavenly Sword Peak instead.

In a room there, Fan Meng gazed at Yang Ye as she spoke softly, “I heard you’re going to the Ocean of Clouds Academy!” Moreover, Fan Li was by her side.

At this moment, both of them weren’t considered members of the sword school, and they’d assumed the identity of Yang Ye’s family and were staying at his residence within the sword school.

Yang Ye nodded and said, “Cultivate well here once I’ve gone there. If you don’t know anything or are bullied, you can go seek help from Senior Brothers Chen Dong and Wu Yanzhong!”

“All of them think that both my sister and I are yours, so how could they dare to bully us?” Fan Meng’s voice almost sounded like the buzz of a mosquito, and her face had even turned rosy. It made her seem beautiful and capable of moving the hearts of all men.

Fan Li had quite an uncomfortable expression on her face as well!

Yang Ye smiled embarrassedly, and then he gazed at Fan Li, “Take good care of her, and take good care of yourself. I hope that you’d have attained the Monarch Realm and Fan Meng has successfully joined the Ancient Sword School when we meet again!”

Fan Li gazed at him and spoke softly, “Take care!”

Yang Ye nodded, and then he walked out of the room.

“Big Sister, let’s both marry him, alright?”

Fan Li was at a loss for words.

After he left the Heavenly Sword Peak, Yang Ye transformed into a ray of light and shot towards the academy on his sword.

“Ocean of Clouds Academy! I’m coming!” Yang Ye’s voice resounded through the sky!
