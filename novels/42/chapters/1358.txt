Chapter 1359 – Authority!

After he entered through the door, he arrived at a room. The room wasn’t huge. It was less than 300m in both length and width, and there was nothing in it.

It was completely empty!

Yang Ye’s eyes were filled with bewilderment.

Suddenly, the Sword Spirit appeared by his side. She glanced at the surroundings and frowned slightly, “Something is off.”

Yang Ye sensed the surroundings carefully and nodded, “Indeed.”

Even though they felt that something was slightly off, they couldn’t put a finger on it.

Just like that, a long time passed before the Sword Spirit’s pupils suddenly constricted, “I’ve got it.”

Yang Ye gazed at her, “What is it?”

She turned to look at him, “Go out and come back in.’

Even though he didn’t know why she asked him to do that, Yang Ye had done as she’d said. He’d left the room and walked back in, and then his brows were pressed tightly together. Because he hadn’t noticed anything. But it didn’t take long for his pupils to constrict slightly, “How could this be possible?”

He noticed that the time within the room was different from the time outside it!

The Sword Spirit nodded while shock filled her eyes, “It’s truly inconceivable that such a divine treasure actually exists in this world. Turning time backwards. What amazing ability!”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Turning time back?”

She explained, “You should be aware that true Voiders possess the Laws of Time. They are able to slow down their opponents for a certain period while their own speed remains the same. But in this place, the space here is capable of making time flow backwards. To explain it in simpler terms, if you cultivate here for 10 years, only a year would have passed in the outside world!”

Yang Ye’s expression instantly changed.

10 years there was equivalent to a year outside!

It was simply insane!

Meanwhile, the Sword Spirit added, “This isn’t the Laws of Time anymore, and it’s something that surpasses the Laws of Time. It’s a supreme technique.... That old man in Daoist robes might have attained a level that we can’t imagine.”

Yang Ye nodded. He knew the old man was very strong, extremely strong. After all, just a clone of the old man had killed Jian Wuji! How terrifying was that? However, he didn’t know exactly how strong the old man was.

Meanwhile, the Sword Spirit shook her head and said, “There’s no need to think too much about it. It’s not impossible for you to attain such a cultivation in the future. Now that you have this room, your cultivation will be much swifter and you’ll attain the Voider Realm soon. Attain it as soon as possible because the Emperor Realm is far insufficient for you.”

“Of course!” Yang Ye nodded. Even though Voiders were no threat to him now, Voiders weren’t the only experts in this world. There were Semi-Deities and even Deities. Moreover, there were even stronger existences above the Deity Realm. If he didn’t possess formidable strength, then what would he do if he had to face an expert like Jian Xu or Blind Maiden one day?

He had to grow stronger! He had to grow ceaselessly stronger!

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings and said, “Let’s go!” There was no rush to cultivate immediately. In any case, the room was within him, so he could enter it at any time.

The Sword Spirit nodded and transformed into a ray of light that entered Yang Ye’s body.

Once he left the room, Yang Ye didn’t return to reality. He went to the Pavilion of Alchemy on the 2nd level. There was a young girl lying there.

It was Xiao Qi who was still unconscious.

He felt a huge amount of guilt towards her. Because she’d fallen unconscious while trying to save him. Besides allowing her to just wake up on her own, the only other way to wake her up was to refine a suitable medicinal pill. However, he hadn’t had any time to study the Dao of Alchemy, so Xiao Qi had been unconscious until now.

Yang Ye rubbed her head gently and said, “Once I’m done with the matters in the Radiant Dimension, I’ll focus on alchemy and wake you up. I guarantee it won’t take more than a year.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he started walking towards the furnace.

At the moment Yang Ye turned around, Xiao Qi’s finger had moved slightly. At the same time, a thread of blue light suddenly appeared on her forehead. But it only took a moment for it to vanish.

Yang Ye hadn’t noticed all of that. He’d arrived before the furnace, and there was a flame blazing within it. Yang Ye’s face gradually grew solemn as he gazed at it.

Mo Xiaoleng’s flames were very strong and terrifying, but the Divine Yin Flame before him was absolutely stronger!

Mo Xiaoleng’s flames felt very dangerous to him, but the Divine Yin Flame didn’t just feel dangerous, he actually felt terrified while standing before it. After all, even Blind Maiden, Jian Xu, and the demonic dragon hadn’t made him feel like that!

He possessed a body at the Epoch Realm, but he would definitely be instantly transformed into ashes if he were to jump into the furnace. That was something he believed with absolute certainty!

Could he control it?

This wasn’t a thought that he’d only had now. He’d had such a thought from the moment he laid eyes on it. However, at that time, he’d immediately rejected the thought once it appeared in his mind. After all, his strength was too weak, so it was best to not hold such thoughts. Yet now, he was an Emperor, and his strength was much greater than before.

If he could control it, then his strength would definitely rise tremendously! Because even Blind Maiden would probably dare not go head on against the Divine Yin Flame!

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment before stretching his hand forward towards it. Suddenly, the Sword Spirit appeared by his side and shook her head.

Yang Ye remained silent for a long time before he nodded. It was obviously impossible for him to subdue the Divine Yin Flame with his current strength. If he tried to force it, then it might backfire!

Even though it was quite a pity, his life was more important!

Right when Yang Ye and the Sword Spirit had turned around and started walking away, a voice suddenly resounded, “Come again when you’ve accessed the 4th level.”

Yang Ye and the Sword Spirit’s bodies trembled, and then they exchanged glances. Both their eyes were filled with shock. A moment of silence ensued as they gazed at the Divine Yin Flame. Because the voice had come from within the furnace.

Yang Ye gulped and asked, “You... you can speak?”

However, the Divine Yin Flame didn’t answer him.

Yang Ye refused to give up and repeated the question a few more times, but it didn’t answer him.

Yang Ye gazed at the Sword Spirit, and the latter shook her head, “Come back when you’ve accessed the 4th level!”

Yang Ye nodded. He glanced at the Divine Yin Flame, and then he left the Pavilion of Alchemy.

Outside the pavilion, Yang Ye was puzzled, “That fellow can clearly speak, yet why won’t he answer me?”

The Sword Spirit glanced at Yang Ye and said, “Do you really want to know?”

Yang Ye replied, “Of course.”

She explained, “There’s only one explanation. You’re too weak right now, so he feels that you’re not qualified to speak with him!” As soon as she finished speaking, she vanished on the spot.

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

Even she has started to be playful! Yang Ye shook his head and returned to the Void Cloud Shuttle.

...

Yang Ye was standing at the bow while Ye Liuyun was by his side.

At this moment, the Void Cloud Shuttle had left Dark Hell Continent and was in space. Endless stars filled their fields of vision. There were shooting stars flashing through the distance from time to time and vanished from their fields of vision.

“So space is so beautiful!” Ye Liuyun gazed at the stars that covered the sky and couldn’t help but exclaim with admiration.

“Indeed!” Yang Ye nodded. It was the first time that he was in space. Needless to say, a person would notice how tiny he or she is when standing amidst the endless starry sky.

Humans were like specks of dust when compared to the boundless universe.

Of course, a universe was very tiny to some.

Yang Ye remained silent for a long time before he said, “How many people came with us?”

Ye Liuyun pondered deeply for a moment and said, “A total of 11 Voiders. There were 12, but Senior Jian Xu vanished, so only 11 remain. There are 4 from our Sword Alliance, and they are Senior Jian Ji, Qian Lankong, Shui Linlang, and Senior Hei Yuan. As for Emperors, a total of 3,000 came. Our Sword Alliance and the Slayer Pavilion have a total of around 1,000. The rest are from the 3 sects and 3 cities.”

Ye Liuyun hesitated briefly at this point and asked, “Are we going to fight someone?”

“I’m going to get some people!” Yang Ye gazed at the dense expanse of stars and said, “I hope there’s no need to fight!” He didn’t want to waste time in the Radiant Dimension because Lady was still waiting for him.

Ye Liuyun nodded and said, “The 3 cities and 3 sects are following us because of your power and influence. They dare not refuse you. But it won’t last for long. What exactly do you plan to do with them?”

“I don’t want to force them to join the Sword Alliance!” replied Yang Ye. Even though he could do that and had the ability to do so, it would bury a seed of disaster for the Sword Alliance.

“I understand what you mean!” She said, “I have a way.”

Yang Ye replied, “Go on!”

She explained, “Benefits. Use benefits to tie them to us and make them take the initiative to stay with the Sword Alliance.”

Yang Ye said, “Continue!” Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

She smiled, “Just Dark Hell Continent is too small for our Sword Alliance, right?”

Yang Ye gazed at her for a long time and said, “Liuyun, you have great aspirations, and you’ve thought very far ahead.”

She said, “Many powers control more than one world. Our Sword Alliance is growing stronger and stronger, so it naturally can’t just stand still. We have to obtain even more worlds. Once we obtain those worlds, we can share a little of the benefits to the 3 cities and 3 sects. We can allow them to send their forces to that world to establish a power of their own in that world. In that way, they’ll naturally follow close behind our Sword Alliance. At that time, they wouldn’t leave even if you asked them to.”

Yang Ye glanced at her and said, “Liuyun, have you already started making arrangements for the Sword Alliance’s future development and expansion?”

Ye Liuyun nodded, “There are many things that have to be planned in advance!”

Yang Ye smiled, “I’m lucky to gain your help!”

Ye Liuyun smiled and spoke seriously, “Actually, I like doing this. You know... when I was a mercenary in the past, all of us were like ants in the eyes of Emperors and Voiders. Whenever we encountered the disciples of those sects or cities, or even if we encountered Emperors, we would hide as far away as we could. Because we were absolutely afraid of offending them. Yet now, while I’m just an Emperor, even Voiders dare not be disrespectful to me.”

As she spoke, she stretched her hand forward in Yang Ye’s direction, and then she slowly clenched it tightly, “I’ve become addicted to the feeling of possessing power and authority.”

Yang Ye gazed at her for a few breaths of time before he said, “Since you’ve become addicted to it, then make it grow larger and larger!”

Ye Liuyun smiled, “Of course!”

Yang Ye smiled, and then he turned to look towards the distance, “We’ve arrived.”

There was a huge teleportation formation in the distance. Needless to say, it was the stellar teleportation formation that Blind Maiden had told him about!
