Chapter 2521 – Is It Him?

In the Primordial Pagoda.

Yang Ye summoned all the demons to the Ascension Platform!

He flicked the Origin World Pills over to them.

They gazed at him, and he said, “These are Origin World Pills that are said to be able to help you advance to the Five World Realm. Of course, whether you succeed depends on yourselves.”

They exchanged glances, and then they left with their pills.

But it only took a moment for Oxxy to return, and he walked over to Yang Ye and said, “S-Snowy…”

Yang Ye smiled, “She’ll be back soon!”

Oxxy nodded slightly and left!

As he watched them leave, Yang Ye had a smile on his face. After all, he would have many Five World Realm demon beasts soon!

A short while later, Yang Ye left the Primordial Pagoda, and Ye Zhibei and Xing Biqing were still in the hall.

Yang Ye glanced at them and said, “Let’s leave this place!”

Just a moment ago, he sensed many divine senses sweeping the area. Obviously, the demon race was searching for human experts in the city.

They nodded, left the city, and returned to the mountain range.

However, only a few remained here when they returned!Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Xing Biqing and Ye Zhibei frowned when they witnessed this.

Xing Biqing gazed at Leng Ao and Lu Jue, “What happened?”

Lu Jue replied indifferently, “They were afraid of death, so they left!”

“Afraid of death?” Xing Biqing shook her head, “Impossible. Few here are actually afraid of death!”

She gazed at Leng Ao and continued, “What’s the real reason?”

Leng Ao glanced at Yang Ye and said, “Just a while ago, we were discussing the division of benefits upon entering the city. The division didn’t go well, so many left!”

“Division of benefits?” Xing Biqing’s frown deepened, “What benefits?”

Leng Ao replied indifferently, “Many felt that most of the resources in the city were in our hands, so they should get something for helping us reclaim the city. Otherwise, it would be fruitless labor!”

Xing Biqing gained a rough understanding of the situation at this point.

She shook her head and sighed!

Xing Biqing just walked off to the side, and Ye Zhibei fell silent as well.

Yang Ye glanced at the others. There were no more than 30 left here, and practically all of them had businesses in the city. As far as they were concerned, it was in their best interests to return to the city!

But what about the rest? They had no businesses in the city, they were just independent cultivators!

Everyone had their own selfish desires. As far as those people were concerned, they were risking their lives for the benefit of others, and they refused to do something like that!

Yang Ye fell silent for a moment, and then he walked over to Xing Biqing and Ye Zhibei, “Allow me to be honest, the demon race is a single group, while the human race is a single group too, there are countless smaller groups in the entire group. Only benefits can bind these smaller groups together… Or to be more honest, you have no right to fight the demon race.”

He had a rough understanding of the demon race’s strength. If these humans stayed united, then they would have a chance, but the only way to make them be united was through benefits!

Only wealth could make them do things!

If there were enough benefits, then they would be willing to risk their lives!

Actually, it was very normal!

Xing Biqing looked up in the direction of the city, and a long time passed before she shook her head and smiled, “We can’t get back into the city anymore!”

They couldn’t!

War City was under the control of the demon race, and there was only one voice in the demon race. Under such circumstances, the human race needed to have the same in order to succeed at taking back the city!

However, the human race’s core was their own interests and benefits! Moreover, no one could truly make the others submit and willingly follow them!

A long time passed before Xing Biqing shook her head and gazed at Yang Ye, “Didn’t you want to leave?”

She flicked two golden talismans over to Yang Ye.

Teleportation talismans!

Xing Biqing smiled, “I didn’t give them to you earlier because I wanted you to stay and help us with retaking the city. Yet now, it isn’t necessary. Go attend to your own business!”

Yang Ye spoke in a low voice, “What about the both of you?”

Xing Biqing glanced at the surroundings and said, “Actually, they don’t realize that while we have many businesses in the city, we still have endless resources at our disposal even without entering the city. But it isn’t the same for them. They will be forced to flee all around War Dimension without the city’s protection, and without the spirit vein in the city, their speed of cultivation will drop drastically!”

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and didn’t say anything in the end. He really didn’t want to interfere with the matters in here.

Because it was Eternal Kingdom’s own internal issues!

Yang Ye took the talismans and said, “If you need anything, feel free to contact me. I’ll definitely rush over while I’m still in Eternal Kingdom.”

He didn’t waste more time and crushed one of the golden talismans, and then he vanished on the spot.

Once Yang Ye left, Ye Zhibei and Xing Biqing exchanged glances. In the end, Xing Biqing asked, “Is it him?”

Ye Zhibei remained silent.

…

Once he left the War Dimension, Yang Ye didn’t return to the Ancient Sword Sect immediately. He found a hidden spot and entered the Primordial Pagoda instead.

In the Primordial Pagoda, Yang Ye went to the dragon’s territory in the Sword Sect’s rear mountains. At this moment, it was lying on the ground while faint golden light surrounded it. Moreover, its aura was fluctuating. They were signs of advancement.

Yang Ye grinned at the sight of this and left. After that, he went to the Chaotic Fruit Tree. There were 10 fruits on it, but they weren’t fully mature.

Their speed of maturing had slowed down tremendously without Snowy here!

Yang Ye was about to get close when both of them released strands of powerful pressure to push Yang Ye away!

Yang Ye was slightly stunned by this, and then he spoke angrily, “Trust me, I’ll tell Snowy to toss both of you out!”

The trees were furious, and strands of powerful energy rippled out incessantly from them. Suddenly, Yang Ye raised Executor and pressed it against one of the trees, “Dammit! You’re living in my place and living off my resources, so what are you being so arrogant for? You better be humbler or I’ll chop you up into firewood!”

As he spoke, a wave of powerful sword intent enveloped them!

These trees were very proud, and they didn’t give face to anyone but Snowy!

He felt that this was an issue that had to be rectified!

Yang Ye was quite surprised to find that they refused to submit. Conversely, two powerful waves of pressure suddenly enveloped Yang Ye, and then the trees started to sway!

Bang! Bang!

Yang Ye was instantly blasted over 300m back by two strands of mysterious energy!

Yang Ye was stunned as he stood there. They had actually dared to attack him!

Yang Ye was about to draw his sword when the Primordial Pagoda suddenly appeared before him, and it spun swiftly as if it was conveying something!

Yang Ye clearly understood it. He pointed at the trees, “I’m sure you saw how they attacked me first!”

The Primordial Pagoda trembled slightly as it tried to tell him that someone like him should ignore minor things like that!

Yang Ye took a deep breath and said, “I’ll give you face!”

He gazed at the trees and continued, “I’m telling you now. I’m only giving the pagoda face today. I won’t make a fuss about it with you now. Otherwise, both of you are dead!”

He turned around and walked away.

At the instant he left, Yang Ye couldn’t help but glance at the trees again. He was quite shocked by their strength! That attack hadn’t been any weaker than a Five World Realm expert!

Were they that strong?

They were just two trees! Moreover, they hadn’t even matured completely!

Extraordinary! Extraordinary indeed!

Yang Ye shook his head and left their territory!

Once Yang Ye left, the Primordial Pagoda floated over to the trees. The trees clearly didn’t reject the Primordial Pagoda, and the pagoda started trembling as it tried to educate them.

It was telling them that the fellow from before couldn’t be offended, and they had to be humble. Otherwise, Snowy would chop them into pieces…

Unfortunately, they couldn’t understand any of it. As far as they were concerned, everything was done by instinct!

And in their instinct, they only acknowledged Snowy!

…

Once he left the Chaotic Fruit Trees, Yang Ye went to the Worldborn Fruit Tree’s territory. Yang Ye naturally had to take care of these trees because Snowy had asked him to do so before she left!

He didn’t want them to be half dead when she returned. Otherwise, Snowy would definitely be sad.

Yang Ye went over to the Worldborn Fruit Tree. The tree was only a little over a meter tall, and it was fully covered in inky green! Besides that, it had two ink green fruits!

They were unripe Worldborn Fruits!

Suddenly, the tree shook, and then a strand of inky green energy floated over to Yang Ye. It enveloped Yang Ye, causing him to instantly feel warm and pleasant!

It was extremely comfortable!

Yang Ye gazed at the tree and wondered if it was trying to express its goodwill.

Meanwhile, the Worldborn Tree shook, and then an ink green branch extended over to Yang Ye. The branch touched his chest, and then a strand of ink green liquid surging into Yang Ye!

Yang Ye couldn’t help but take a deep breath because it was really pleasant!

A short while later, the branch touched Yang Ye gently, and its intent to curry favor with him was very, very obvious!

Yang Ye walked over to the tree and touched it gently, and then he spoke seriously, “Very good, you’re smart, and you have a great future. I’ll definitely speak highly of you to Snowy when she returns!”

The Worldborn Fruit Tree was even happier upon hearing this!

Yang Ye hadn’t noticed that a pocket of completely pure space that was without any impurities surrounded the tree.

Purification!

It could purify the impurities from people and the world!

The Worldborn Fruit Tree!

One of the purest things in the world!
