Chapter 1158 – Actually, I Usually Don’t Kill!

Yang Ye was puzzled, “What’s wrong?”

The woman in beast skin said, “Even though violet crystals are extremely precious, it’s impossible for them to be worth a million extreme-grade energy stones! A single violet crystal is equivalent to around 100,000 extreme-grade energy stones.”

Yang Ye frowned slightly, but it didn’t take long for him to come to an understanding. He realized that the situation here was probably different from the Radiant Dimension. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

She continued, “You can be sold for 10,000 extreme-grade energy stones at the very most while a violet crystal is equivalent to 10 of you. Even 10 of you might not be worth a violet crystal, yet you want to make me lend you a violet crystal.... You really are quite sick. Moreover, I have to save for a few years to gain a single violet crystal, so how could I possibly lend one to you? I still intend to advance into the Quasi Emperor Realm!”

Yang Ye was speechless.

“Quickly eat that herb. If you don’t recuperate as soon as possible, then Big Sister Canglan will kill you. She doesn’t keep worthless people alive!” She turned around and left once she finished speaking.

Yang Ye gazed at the herb in his grasp and was quite speechless. What exactly is this world? Violet crystals and extreme-grade energy stones are actually that precious!

Suddenly, the woman in beast skin walked over and said, “Let’s go!”

Yang Ye asked, “You’re letting me go?”

She knocked Yang Ye’s head and said, “You must be dreaming. You really don’t seem normal at all! You’ve been captured and are about to be sold. But you don’t seem to be sad at all, and you aren’t afraid too.”

Yang Ye was slightly stunned, and then he spoke in an extremely serious manner, “You’re so beautiful and kind, so how could you possibly do something so cruel? Right?”

“Stop trying to flatter me! I couldn’t be bothered to pay any attention to you if it isn’t for the fact that you look a little like someone. Cut the crap and come with me. We’ve noticed a mountain range nearby, and there might be a spirit vein there.” As soon as she finished speaking, she grabbed Yang Ye by the shoulder and started walking out of the dungeon.

...

Once he left the dungeon, Yang Ye looked up at the sky. It was grey and hazy while lightning flashed successively from time to time within the grey and hazy clouds. There was some spirit energy in the surroundings, but it was extremely scarce. Just as Lady had said, it was a world where the spirit energy here had almost dried up. At this moment, he understood why energy stones were so precious here!

Energy stones were formed from spirit energy. Since spirit energy was so scarce here, energy stones were naturally extremely precious.

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts and looked towards the distance. There were over a dozen women in the distance, and the weakest amongst them was a Saint!

The woman who led the group had a scar on her face, and she was the strongest amongst them. She was a high-rank Saint. While she was a high-rank Saint, she gave Yang Ye the same feeling that a Quasi Emperor would give him.

Yang Ye thought in his heart, the geniuses of this world aren’t simple at all!

One of the women by the scarred woman’s side frowned when she saw Yang Ye and the woman in beast skin, “Nan Shuang, didn’t we ask you to kill him? Why have you brought him out here?”

Yang Ye was speechless.

The woman in beast skin who was called Nan Shuang gazed at the scarred woman instead, “Big Sister Canglan, let this fellow stay with me. In any case, killing him won’t produce any spirit energy.”

That woman by the scarred woman’s side said, “Nan Shuang, are you still thinking about that fellow, Lin Xing? He’s a disciple of the Dark Sky Sect, and he has long since forgotten you. Wake up!”

“Gu Lan, are you looking for a beating?” Nan Shuang clenched her fists as she glared at that woman, and she seemed like a raging tiger.

Yang Ye glanced at Nan Shuang. Could it be that I’m really quite similar in appearance to that fellow, Lin Xing? No matter what, it’s a good thing.

After all, if it wasn’t for her protection, then he would probably be....

“Enough!” Meanwhile, the scarred woman gazed at Nan Shuang, “You can take him with you if you want, but I’ll kill him myself if he proves to be a burden.”

Yang Ye glanced at the scarred woman. She seemed to have noticed Yang Ye’s gaze and looked at him as well. However, Yang Ye had already moved his gaze away and stood behind Nan Shuang.

The scarred woman’s brows were knit slightly together, but she didn’t say anything.

Meanwhile, another woman suddenly ran over from afar, and there was a wisp of excitement and delight on her face, “Big Sister Canglan, we noticed a lone Saint ahead, and he seems to even be injured.”

The eyes of the other women by the scarred woman’s side had instantly lit up when they heard this, and there was a trace of excitement and joy in their eyes as well. After that, they gazed at the scarred woman.

“Let’s go!” As soon as she spoke, the scarred woman and the others shot towards the distance.

Nan Shuang grabbed Yang Ye and flew off as well, “Come! Let’s go kill him!”

Yang Ye asked, “Is that person an enemy of yours?”

Nan Shuang replied, “No!”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Then why are all of you going to kill him?”

Nan Shuang answered, “What a fool! Spirit energy will explode forth when Saints are killed!”

Yang Ye’s face froze, and a short while passed before he gulped, “All of you are going to kill him because spirit energy will burst forth once he dies?”

Nan Shuang replied, “Why else?”

Yang Ye felt like his brainpower wasn’t enough to fathom all of this. When a Saint fell, the spirit energy within that Saint would be returned to the world. Yang Ye was naturally aware of that. But he hadn’t expected that these women actually intended to kill someone who had no enmity with them because of that spirit energy. Yang Ye couldn’t help but feel a wave of fear sweep through him when he thought up to this point. Because he would have probably been killed by them if he was a Saint.

Even though his body was at the Divine Shift Realm, they would definitely be able to kill him if they really wanted to. At the very most, they would have to exhaust a bit more effort. After all, the Divine Shift Realm wasn’t invincible.

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and asked, “Isn’t doing that not very nice?”

Nan Shuang turned to glance at Yang Ye and said, “I never noticed that you’re quite kind. But how would we obtain energy stones if we don’t kill Saints for their spirit energy? How would we improve our strength without energy stones? How would we survive without strength? Actually, are you still just a Half-Saint because you’ve never killed anyone?”

Yang Ye had quite an uncomfortable expression on his face. He thought for a moment and said, “Actually, I usually don’t kill.”
