Chapter 2746 – Absolutely Decisive!

Yang Ye asked someone to lead Huang Ying’s group into the city. Along with the arrival of these experts, the entire Paradise City was quiet no more.

Once they arrived here, they realized that the spirit energy here was extremely abundant!

If countless had been hesitant before this, then now, practically no one hesitated anymore.

At times like these, spirit energy was undoubtedly the most important.

If there was spirit energy, there was a future!

Along with the desolate race’s group siding with Yang Ye, more and more experts rushed over here.

In just a day of time, Paradise City was full of countless experts, and there were over 20 Destiny Realm experts among them. Moreover, this number didn’t include the Yang Clan and the others.

Yang Ye hadn’t relied on prestige or charm to gather all these experts here, he’d relied on benefits!

Since the ancient times, only benefits could truly move a person! If he wanted the world to obey him, he had to give them sufficient benefits. Of course, powerful strength was necessary as well.

But it didn’t take long for the War Dimension’s experts to come too.

They were led by Liu Yuan! And Ye Zhibei was behind her.

At the city gates.

Yang Ye smiled, “Welcome!”

Liu Yuan spoke solemnly, “Yang Ye, are you really planning on fighting the End World?”

Yang Ye smiled, “Do you think I’m joking?”

She replied, “If you win, you’ll be the new master of the Three Dimensional Universe. At that time, how will you treat all of us?”

Yang Ye replied, “Did the Eternal Lord make you ask this question?”

She looked him in the eyes, “I represent the entire War Dimension!”

Yang Ye replied, “Why don’t we head inside and talk about it?”

She nodded.

They entered the city, and 37 people were gathered in the hall!

All of them were Destiny Realm experts!

It could be said that practically all the Destiny Realm experts outside of the End World were here.

Everyone was looking at Yang Ye. Since they were here, they naturally considered Yang Ye their leader. Of course, it depended on how he acted. If Yang Ye merely wanted to use them against the End World, then they would not willingly allow him to use them!

Yang Ye glanced at them. The experts of the desolate race and War Dimension were here, but they surprisingly didn’t cause trouble.

Yang Ye said, “All of you are Destiny Realm experts. What is your greatest problem? Destiny! If Destiny shows herself, all of you will die. Or I should say that Destiny has stopped all of you from going further. Destiny is an issue, and it’s the greatest issue that all of you, and even I have to face!

Suddenly, a voice resounded, “Destiny chose you!”

Yang Ye shook his head, “There are four forms of Destiny. I’m sure you’re aware that I’ve only obtained the acknowledgement of two of them.”

He stood up and continued, “Our true enemy isn’t just the End World, it is Destiny.”

The hall fell silent.

Meanwhile, Huang Ying suddenly said, “Allow me to be frank. Do all of you wish to stay in the Destiny Realm forever?”

All of them shook their heads. They were at the Destiny Realm, the highest realm in this world. If they said they had no desire to go higher, then they were definitely lying. Man’s desire for power had no end.

The person from before spoke again, “Allow me to be frank. We can’t go against Destiny. We’re no match for Destiny’s strength.”

The others nodded. While they wanted to advance further, they knew their own limitations. Even the experts in the End World didn’t dare to go head-on against Destiny!

Yang Ye fell silent for a moment and said, “I’ll deal with Destiny!”

The others gazed at Yang Ye, even Jian Wudi.

Yang Ye said, “I’ll deal with Destiny.”

Huang Ying asked, “Brother Yang, what are you trying to say?”

Yang Ye replied, “What that guy said is absolutely correct. Destiny’s strength is beyond most people. So, I’ll deal with Destiny. If Destiny shows herself in the future, I’ll deal with her.”

The Destiny Realm experts here exchanged glances! Yang Ye had promised to deal with Destiny on his own!

Was he being conceited?

They didn’t think so. Because among all the people here, only Yang Ye had the best chance of fighting Destiny.

Someone suddenly asked, “We just have to help you against the End World, right?”

Yang Ye smiled, “You’re not helping me, you’re helping yourselves!”

He flicked his finger and a screen of light appeared before them. Within it was the scene of a world collapsing.

Yang Ye smiled, “Do you know who did this?”

“The End World!” Suddenly, a middle aged man stepped forward, “It’s known as the Millionth World, and it’s the world I belong to. But it’s gone now.”

Yang Ye nodded, “There are no weaklings in the End World. All of them are peak Destiny Realm experts, and they won’t care about your fate. Or I should say, they won’t care about the fate of the sects and clans behind you. As far as they are concerned, only Destiny Realm experts can enter their notice, and those below the Destiny Realm are just ants. Of course, if you’re alone, going to the End World will be a better choice for you.”

Meanwhile, Huang Ying said, “Brother Yang, since we’re here, it’s obvious that we’ve given up on joining the End World. There are only two things of concern to us now, Destiny and spirit energy. The spirit energy throughout Eternal Kingdom has…”

He chuckled and continued, “Now that we’re here, the spirit energy here is abundant, so you’ve resolved that issue for us. As for the other concern, you’ve agreed to deal with it for us. So, we have no other issues. Brother Yang, forgive me for asking but the End World seems to plan on fighting Destiny too, so can we join forces?”

Yang Ye shook his head.

Huang Ying asked softly, “Why?”

Yang Ye smiled, “They want the Sprite Progenitor, and the divine vein. They want everything for themselves.”

The great issue between him and the End World was Snowy and Erya.

The End World definitely didn’t want Snowy and Erya for good reasons. It was something he would absolutely never agree to, and the End World was obviously unwilling to give up on obtaining them!

So, they had to fight before their fight with Destiny!

Huang Ying nodded slightly, “I understand. Brother Yang, what’s your plan now?”

His plan!

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings and grinned, “Kill them of course!”

Take the initiative to attack!

All of them were shocked when they realized Yang Ye’s plans!

Yang Ye said, “Waiting for them to attack will lock us in a passive position, and refusing to take the initiative would make us no different than weaklings. Prepare yourselves, we’re setting out for the End World in two hours. Even if we can’t annihilate them, we’re going to cripple them this time!”

Yang Ye turned around and walked out of the hall.

The others exchanged glances, and then a middle aged man asked, “Is he serious?”

Huang Ying nodded, “He should be!”

The middle aged man hesitated for a moment and said, “It’s quite rash!”

Huang Ying smiled, “I don’t think so. The point is to take them by surprise.”

The middle aged man nodded slightly and didn’t speak further.

A short while later, the group dispersed.

Meanwhile, Jian Wudi went to Yang Ye and spoke solemnly, “Are you serious?”

Yang Ye smiled, “Martial Ancestor, do I look like I’m joking?”

Jian Wudi shook his head, “It’s quite risky. Especially when we still haven’t figured out the identity and true strength of that mysterious expert in the End World!”

Yang Ye smiled, “Once we go there and fight them, we’ll learn about that person’s strength and identity.”

Jian Wudi fell silent.

Yang Ye continued, “Martial Ancestor, the world is in chaos, absolute chaos. Once the End World is eliminated, I will make all worlds and all races live in harmony, and I will restore the spirit energy in the Eternal Kingdom. Of course, I’ll create some new rules, rules that all powers must abide by. Obviously, I’m a selfish person, and I want to annihilate them for one other reason, and it’s for Snowy and Erya. They are my closest loved ones, and I will protect them. If anyone dares to touch them, I’ll make that person suffer horribly. The End World dared to target them, so I’ll make all of them suffer horribly.”

Yang Ye bowed slightly to him and left.

Jian Wudi remained speechless for a long time before finally shaking his head and smiling. This grand disciple of his was a truly emotional person, and a frank person.

Yang Ye was eliminating the End World to build a new order, and for his own selfish intentions.

He didn’t try to conceal his selfish intentions at all!

Two hours later, countless people soundlessly vanished from Paradise City.

All the Destiny Realm experts had left the city.

Yang Ye hadn’t just decided this on a whim. It was because he knew that if he needed time, the End World definitely needed time too. Otherwise, the End World would have attacked by now.

Since both sides needed time, he decided to stop waiting. He planned to attack directly and was betting on who needed more time!

Most importantly, he was at the peak of the Destiny Realm, and he was the strongest right now. It was the most beneficial time for him to attack.

All of them were peak experts, so it didn’t take them long to arrive at the End World.

The world that Yang Ye had destroyed twice!

Yang Ye led the group, and Jian Wudi and An Nanjing were on either side of him.

As for Erya, he hadn’t allowed her to show herself yet.

Suddenly, a middle aged man appeared before them.

It was Emperor Li.

He was about to speak upon catching sight of them, but Yang Ye suddenly said, “Don’t waste your breath on him! Kill them!”

As soon as he gave the order, Yang Ye drew his sword and swung it at Emperor Li.

Emperor Li was stunned for a moment because he hadn’t expected Yang Ye to just attack without saying a word!

Yang Ye had just immediately attacked!

Not to mention Emperor Li, even the others behind Yang Ye were stunned!

At the very least, Yang Ye should have said a few words!

Emperor Li recovered from his shock and was about to counterattack. However, Yang Ye instantly turned blood red, and a wave of powerful sword intent enveloped Emperor Li as well!

The Demonic Sword Dao!

At this moment, Emperor Li’s expression changed drastically. A powerful aura surged out from him, but along with the descent of Yang Ye’s sword, the aura was instantly obliterated.Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Meanwhile, Emperor Li’s body suddenly exploded.

Boom!

Yang Ye was pushed around 30m back.

Meanwhile, Emperor Li’s soul was 3km away.

He’d sacrificed his body to save his own life!

Emperor Li had been very decisive in this matter!

Yang Ye grinned slightly, but it was quite a fierce grin. He raised his right hand, and a blood red sword soundlessly appeared there.

Yang Ye pointed the sword at Emperor Li, “You’re too weak for me! Tell the black hand to attack! I’ll fight him one on one!”
