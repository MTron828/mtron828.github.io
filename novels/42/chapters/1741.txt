Chapter 1742 - You Don’t Have To Search! I’m Here!

An ancestor of the Yang Clan had emerged from his closed door cultivation.

A 6th stage True Realm expert!

Yang Ye remained silent on the spot.

He didn’t know how strong a 6th stage True Realm expert was, but he’d experienced the strength of a 4th stage True Realm expert, and he found them extremely difficult to kill. As for someone at the 6th stage…

Fortunately, that expert hadn’t emerged from his closed door cultivation just for Yang Ye.

Yang Lianshuang had provided him with further information.

During the last few days, something huge had occurred on Moment Mountain, and it was that besides a few that fled out of Moment Mountain, all the other disciples of the eight clans perished within Moment Mountain.

Because of this, the eight clans sent True Realm experts into Moment Mountain. But it only took less than 15 minutes for their corpses to be tossed out of Moment Mountain.

At that moment, the eight clans had quite unsightly expressions on their faces.

Or to be more precise, it was the seven clans. Because the Ku Clan hadn’t participated. As for why it didn’t participate, the Ku Clan didn’t say anything, and it just refused to participate.

As for the other seven clans, they didn’t give up. There were many reasons, like for the sake of the treasures or inheritances in there. Of course, there was an even more important reason. They refused to allow any force to threaten their position in the medium universe.

The eight clans reigned supreme over the medium universe, and they would absolutely not allow another power to threaten their status. If such a power appeared, they would destroy it. But because the Ku Clan hadn’t participated because it knew of the situation within Moment Mountain, and it knew that a powerful ancient cultivator and countless mysterious corpses resided there.

Otherwise, the Ku Clan would have participated as well.

Besides the Ku Clan, all the other clans had sent their experts to Moment Mountain. This time, they gathered a force of around 30 True Realm experts. Every single one of them was at the 3rd stage at least.

As for the leader of the group, it was a 5th stage True Realm expert from the Ying Clan!

However, the experts of the seven clans didn’t attack. They just surrounded Moment Mountain and seemed to be waiting for something.

As for the situation within Moment Mountain, it was extremely calm and there was no movement from it.

Yang Ye remained silent on the spot for a long time, and then he decided that he had to go to Moment Mountain.

Regardless of whether it was his realm of cultivation or comprehension in his techniques, they’d arrived at his own limits. Even if he trained, it was difficult for him to make much progress. He needed training in live combat. Moreover, he firmly believed that only battles and especially battles of life and death could allow him to realize what he lacked and improve himself.

He was heading to Moment Mountain to look for trouble with the Yang Clan.

Waiting wasn’t his style! He liked to attack! Of course, he didn’t intend to go head-on against him. He wasn’t most terrifying when he fought others head-on, he was most terrifying when he acted like an assassin!

Based on his speed and ability, if he focused on assassination, then he would be a nightmare for the Yang Clan!

Presently, the Yang Clan had moved a portion of its forces to Moment Mountain, so it was a good opportunity for him. Besides that, he wanted to take a look at the strength of the other clans and the woman in a red dress.

It didn’t take long for Yang Ye to arrive at Moment Mountain.

At this moment, Moment Mountain still remained extremely peaceful. However, Yang Ye sensed numerous powerful auras all around the mountain.

Just as Yang Lianshuang had said, they were all experts at the 3rd stage of the True Realm or above!

Suddenly, a white haired old man appeared in the sky above the mountain. His aura was deep like an ocean. Even though he was quite far away from Yang Ye, Yang Ye could still sense a wave of invisible pressure acting upon him.

Yang Ye knew that it was probably the 5th stage True Realm expert from the Ying Clan, Ying Long!

After the white haired old man appeared there, over 30 other old men appeared behind him. They were the True Realm experts of the seven clans.

The white haired old man glanced at Moment Mountain and spoke indifferently, “Show yourself!”

A moment of silence ensued, and then a ray of red light shot out of Moment Mountain. The woman in a red dress appeared in the sky.

The white haired old man glanced at her and said, “You’re a cultivator from the ancient times?”

She glanced at them and said, “It isn’t too late to fuck off right now!”

The old man replied indifferently, “You’re very confident!”

The woman didn’t say another word. She just waved her right hand, and then a red silk ribbon shot out from within her sleeve.

A cold glow flashed through the white haired old man’s eyes when he saw her attack, and then he took a step forward and slammed a punch at the ribbon.

Boom!

An explosion resounded, and then the white haired old man was blasted over 1km away!

The expressions of everyone here changed at the sight of this scene!

The white haired old man glanced at his hand. An instant later, his pupils constricted because his entire arm had actually vanished without a trace.

The old man looked up at the woman, “What is that energy?!” His voice was filled with fear.

The woman didn’t reply, and she just vanished on the spot.

The old man’s expression changed drastically, “Watch out!”

Meanwhile, the entire sky had suddenly turned blood red. It wasn’t the color of blood; it was a huge red cloth. The red cloth covered the entire sky, and then numerous blood red figures flashed out from the cloth. In just an instant, the sky was covered in blood red figures.

At the same time, shrill cries resounded through the sky.

“Retreat!” The white haired old man’s voice resounded through the sky, and then the experts of the eight clans immediately fled. These True Realm experts were extremely swift, so it only took an instant for them to vanish.

But Yang Ye noticed that in just those five breaths of time that they’d fought, over a dozen True Realm experts had lost their lives!

In other words, the seven clans had lost around half their forces in such a short time!

Yang Ye wiped off the cold sweat on his forehead. She isn’t just strong!Meanwhile, the sky returned to normal, and only the woman in a red dress remained in the sky.

Yang Ye was about to leave, but she suddenly looked in his direction.

Yang Ye’s figure stiffened. A moment later, he showed himself and waved at her, “Long time no see, huh?”

A moment later, the woman appeared in front of Yang Ye. She gazed at him for a long time, and then she suddenly said, “You know… for an instant just now, I almost wanted to kill you.”

Yang Ye’s face froze, “Why?”

She looked him in the eyes, “Because you have numerous treasures. For example, that treasure within you, that wooden sword of yours, or this arm of yours… So long as I obtain just one of them, it’ll bring my strength to a new height.” Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Yang Ye asked, “Then why haven’t you taken any action?”

She shook her head and tapped his chest lightly, “Even though they are great treasures, too much karma will become bound to me if I take them by force. Some things can be taken, but some can’t.”

Yang Ye spoke in a low voice, “What karma?”

She replied, “If you want to eat, you have to earn money, and you have to work to earn money. That’s cause and effect, the principle behind karma. If I take it by force from you, then I’ll be forcefully swept into things that I don’t want to get involved in. Understand?”

Yang Ye asked, “So, based on what you’ve just said, I’ve already been swept into some things?”

“What do you think?” She spoke indifferently, “It’s impossible for you to ever live a peaceful life. Unless you possess absolute strength or abandon those things. However, it’s clearly impossible. Because you’ll die even faster if you abandon them!”

Yang Ye fell silent.

Because he noticed that what she said did make absolute sense. Once he obtained the Primordial Pagoda, he really had been swept into too many things. As for the wooden sword, he hadn’t forgotten that it wanted to go to the Secret Sect. Obviously, that was the karma of the wooden sword.

As for the Wargod’s Arm… Even though there were no consequences yet, there probably would be in the future!

Meanwhile, the woman asked, “What? You’re afraid?”

“Afraid?” Yang Ye shook his head and said, “I don’t like trouble, but I don’t fear it. I don’t know about all this karma. All I do know is that if there’s trouble, I’ll use my sword to resolve it; if my sword can’t resolve it, then I’ll flee!”

Flee! The corners of her eyes twitched slightly. She shook her head, “Don’t come around here anymore. I’m afraid I may be unable to stop myself from killing you.”

As soon as she finished speaking, she vanished on the spot.

Yang Ye shrugged and was about to leave. However, he suddenly frowned and flipped his left palm. The scroll Yang Lianshuang gave him appeared before him. His face turned gloomy when he saw its contents.

The Yang Clan was using all the resources available to it to find him!

The Yang Clan had started to search for him!

This time, it was going to go all out!

There was one other thing, and it was that Yang Lianshuang had been imprisoned!

The information she sent him was the last piece of information she sent!

The Yang Clan had started to act against him and Yang Lianshuang!

Yang Ye stood silently on the spot for a short while, and then he suddenly chuckled, “You don’t have to search for me! I’ll come to you!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he vanished on the spot.

The direction he left towards was the direction of the Yang Clan!
