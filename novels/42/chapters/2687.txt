Chapter 2688 – 100 Years Later!

Yang Ye fell silent.

He was a little shocked and a little surprised.

Because he hadn’t expected this, nor had he expected her to have chosen him because she wanted him to go against the other two forms of herself.

The woman in white was gone.

Only Yang Ye and the young boy remained here.

Yang Ye stood there in silence.

Wrong!

Some of Destiny’s actions were wrong. Even the kind woman in white had made some mistakes.

She had probably made him go down there to release these people.

Yang Ye looked up at the sky. The stronger one was, the less likely one was to feel that any decisions were wrong.

The woman in black killed Destiny Realm experts like crazy, and she felt that she was doing it to protect the world. But do all Destiny Realm experts deserve death?

Of course not.

However, Destiny was really too strong. So strong that no one dared to call them wrong. Even if someone did, they wouldn’t care.

The stronger a person became, the more a person only cared about themselves.

So, there was only one way to make them realize their mistakes and realize that what they’ve done is wrong!

Fight!

Defeat them!

The strong would only reason with the strong!

Yang Ye couldn’t help but laugh bitterly when he thought up to this point.

Fuck!

Defeat the other two forms of Destiny! What the heck! He wasn’t even a match for the woman in black, so how would he defeat the other two? Even though he’d never met them, he felt that he had no chance against them!

It wasn’t a matter of confidence.

Yang Ye shook his head and brought the young boy back to the ruins. Meanwhile, the patriarch of the Past Life Clan and the others came to Yang Ye.

The patriarch bowed respectfully to Yang Ye, “Thank you!”

Yang Ye shook his head, “Actually, she wanted me to release all of you!”

The patriarch of the Past Life Clan fell silent for a long time and shook his head slightly, “No matter what, our clan owes you.”

He withdrew a pure white pearl, “This is the Past Life Pearl, one of my clan’s precious treasures. If you wear it, you’ll possess an endless supply of Past Life Energy, and you’ll be able to use Past Life Energy.”

Suddenly, a white figure appeared.

Snowy!

The woman in white had unsealed the Primordial Pagoda, so Snowy could come outside!

Snowy grabbed the Past Life Pearl and hugged it in her arms.

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

“That’s…” Meanwhile, the patriarch of the Past Life Clan spoke with astonishment, “That’s the Good Sprite…”

Snowy gazed at the old man and shook her head, and then she pointed at herself. She was saying that her name is Snowy! S! N! O! W! Y!

Yang Ye shook his head while feeling absolutely speechless.

The Past Life Clan’s patriarch gazed at Snowy with extreme fear in his eyes. The historical records of the Past Life Clan state that the Good Sprite isn’t a kind existence. Its goodness and kindness was exclusive to the sprites of the world.

It showed none to the other races!

It had been the Good Sprite who’d started that shocking battle that had almost destroyed the world!

If it wasn’t for Destiny, the Three Dimensional Universe may have no other races left!

Snowy glanced at him and was very depressed. She wondered if she was that scary!

Snowy ignored the old man and just went into the Primordial Pagoda with the pearl.

Snowy vanished, and the old man recovered from his shock. He glanced at Yang Ye while the curiosity in his eyes had grown!

Suddenly, Erya appeared by Yang Ye’s side. She glanced at the old man and stretched out her hand, “Do you have another one? Let me play with it!”

The old man was stunned upon seeing Erya, and then he shuddered and took quite a few steps back. He stared at the horns on her head and said, “Y-You… You’re the Evil Beast… You…”

Erya frowned slightly, “What the heck! I asked if you have one of those pearls! Let me play with one!”

The old man gulped, hesitated for a moment, and then passed one to her, “T-This is my clan’s last pearl.”

Yang Ye couldn’t bear to see this because Erya was being too shameless.

He was about to speak when Erya put the pearl away and said, “Well, I’ll return it to you. I…”

“N-N-No…” The old man hurriedly shook his head, “You don’t have to. Consider it a token of respect.”

Erya blinked. She was clearly quite surprised, “Um, you don’t need it?”

The old man nodded firmly.

Yang Ye was stunned speechless.

Meanwhile, Erya suddenly spoke angrily, “Am I someone unreasonable like that? I said I’d return it, so I will.”

The old man glanced at her with slight fear. He didn’t dare to go against her decision and nodded slightly, “A-Alright, then you can!”

Erya nodded with satisfaction and said, “Well, I’ll return it in 100 years!”

She took the pearl and returned into the Primordial Pagoda!

The old man was stunned speechless.

Yang Ye’s face darkened too. 100 years? Why don’t you just say 1,000? Dammit! I didn’t teach her to be so shameless! Who the heck taught her that?!

Snowy too! She’s really shameless now too!

The old man glanced at Yang Ye with a weird glow in his eyes.

This fellow actually has both the Evil Beast and Good Sprite with him… Who the heck is he?

Meanwhile, Yang Ye gazed at the old man, “Are you going to stay here? Or?”

The old man restrained his thoughts and laughed bitterly, “We would like to stay here. While we have the Past Life Well, the spirit energy here is all gone, so it isn’t suitable to live in. Without spirit energy, this place is… Sigh!”

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and summoned Snowy.

Snowy gazed at Yang Ye, cracked a smile, and then waved the Past Life Pearl in front of Yang Ye with a complacent expression on her face.

The old man gazed at Snowy and couldn’t help but feel quite doubtful.

Is this fellow really the Good Sprite of legend?

She doesn’t look like it!

Yang Ye rubbed Snowy’s head and smiled, “You took from them, so you have to help them.”

He glanced at the surroundings and said, “Can you restore the spirit energy in this city?”

He didn’t ask Snowy to restore the spirit energy throughout the World of Past Life because that wasn’t very realistic. Moreover, even if Snowy could, it would definitely be taxing to her.

Snowy’s spirit energy wasn’t endless!

However, restoring the spirit energy in a city was possible! It wasn’t difficult for Snowy at all.

Snowy glanced at the ruins in the surroundings, nodded, and then waved her paw. The Sprite Staff appeared in her grasp.

Snowy flew over to Yang Ye’s head and waved the staff. The space in the surroundings shook, and then spirit energy started to appear in the ruins of the city…

Snowy was extremely amazing, especially when it came to restoring things. It only took a while for the city to be filled with spirit energy.

The old man was overjoyed by the sight of this. Because now they didn’t have to leave this place anymore.

The patriarch of the Past Life Clan bowed to Yang Ye, “My clan will never forget this kindness!”

Yang Ye smiled, “Since the spirit energy here has been restored, I should leave!”

“Wait!” The old man spoke abruptly.

Yang Ye gazed at him, and the latter passed a pitch black command token to Yang Ye, “This is the Past Life Token. Throughout the history of my clan, if anyone with this token came to us, we would practically never refuse that person’s request. Even though the Past Life Clan isn’t what it used to be anymore, if you do need something, we will do our best!”

Yang Ye didn’t refuse. He took it, thanked the old man, and then left.

At the city gates, the old man looked in the direction Yang Ye had left toward, and a long time passed before he turned around and left.

Yang Ye left the Past Life Clan with Snowy, but as soon as he left the area, he met a familiar figure.

The old man with the bamboo chest.

He sized up Yang Ye and smiled, “Congratulations!”

Yang Ye nodded slightly, “Senior?”

The old man spoke softly, “Are you interested in going to a certain place?”Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Yang Ye asked, “Where?”

The old man chuckled, “Martial Sky World.”

Yang Ye asked, “What is that place?”

The old man replied, “The strongest among the 10 clans of the past. This isn’t a test. There’s just a technique there that’s very suitable to you, so you can try your luck there!”

Yang Ye asked curiously, “What technique?”

The old man smiled, “The Martial Sky Invulnerable Body, a supreme body refinement technique of the Martial Sky Clan. It can be said that no other body refinement technique in the Three Dimensional Universe can surpass it. You’re a body cultivator, but your body is clearly unable to keep up with your cultivation and Sword Dao. So, if you’re interested, you can give it a try. Moreover, you have Snowy with you, so you can try to obtain some other things.”

Snowy’s eyes instantly lit up.

She loved searching for treasure!

Yang Ye rubbed Snowy’s head and nodded, “Sounds good! Is it dangerous?”

The old man grinned, “What do you think?”

Yang Ye shook his head and smiled. He knew that if there was something to gain, it definitely meant that there would be danger!

The old man spoke softly, “Take care. I’m going to a place too. Only fate can tell if we’ll ever meet again.”

Yang Ye glanced at the old man. He was about to speak, but the old man vanished.

However, at the same time that he vanished, a teleportation scroll appeared before Yang Ye.

Yang Ye fell silent for a moment, and then he took the scroll and left.
