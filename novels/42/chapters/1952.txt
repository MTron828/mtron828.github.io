Chapter 1953 – Who Dares to Touch My People?!

The 2 Emperors!

Yang Ye glanced at his chest, there was a deep palm imprint there.

When he attacked just now, Qin Chuan’s palm had struck him before his attack struck.

That was why he’d been blasted away instead of Qin Chuan!

Qin Chuan was extremely fast!

Fortunately, it hadn’t been able to cause any real damage to him!

Yang Ye looked up at Qin Chuan. Qin Chuan was just around 20m away from him.

Qin Chuan grinned while a confident and composed smile appeared on his face, “Do you still want to continue?”

“What else?” A smile curled up on the corners of Yang Ye’s mouth, and then he vanished on the spot.

Bang!

An explosion resounded abruptly, and then two figures were pushed backwards repeatedly. But it only took a moment for them to shoot at each other.

Yang Ye wasn’t using his sword!

His sword was a weapon to kill. But he had no intention to kill now, and he only wanted to fight. He wanted to fight to his heart’s content. Especially after he attained the Enlightened Realm, he needed battle to stimulate the potential within him!

Qin Chuan just happened to be a suitable candidate to help him train!

Because Qin Chuan was strong enough!

Qin Chuan’s speed and instinct in battle weren’t inferior to Yang Ye at all, and it was even to the extent that Qin Chuan was faster than Yang Ye. However, Qin Chuan had his flaws, and it was that his body wasn’t as strong as Yang Ye.

But Qin Chuan’s speed had made up for that weakness!

Their collisions were extremely swift. Besides the Dao Realm experts in the surroundings, others couldn’t catch sight of them at all.

Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!

Explosions resounded incessantly. Their intense battle caused space to start trembling violently, and the ground below their feet started to collapse.

Around two hours later, Yang Ye and Qin Chuan stopped!

At this moment, Qin Chuan had a trace of seriousness on his face.

As for Yang Ye, his face was covered in excitement. He’d gained a great deal in this battle.

Suddenly, Qin Chuan said, “You’re using me to train!”

Yang Ye chuckled, “Ten moves have passed, and you haven’t defeated me. So, I’m leaving now!”

Yang Ye turned around and walked away.

Suddenly, Qin Chuan’s voice came from behind him, “Wait!”

Yang Ye stopped and gazed at Qin Chuan, “What? You intend to go back on your word?”

Qin Chuan shook his head slightly, “Of course not. You just came from the outside world?”

Yang Ye nodded.

Qin Chuan fell silent for a moment before he said, “Are you interested in doing something big?”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Something big?”

Qin Chuan grinned, “Do you know where the top geniuses of the human race, sky race, shaman race, devil race, and the other races are?”

Yang Ye asked, “Here?”

Qin Chuan nodded, “Exactly. True geniuses will ceaselessly seek to surpass themselves, and they train themselves in the most dangerous of places. This place is the most dangerous place. So, practically all the top geniuses of the various races are here.”

He stretched out his hands towards his sides and continued, “The reason all the races haven’t joined forces to destroy this abnormal place is because there were other uses for this place, and it’s this place’s ability to temper the geniuses of the various races!”

Yang Ye asked, “What’s the thing you wanted to do?”

Qin Chuan grinned, “Kill!”

Yang Ye frowned, “Kill?”

Qin Chuan replied, “You must kill to survive in this place. If we don’t kill others, others will still come to kill us. We’re fighting with each other! Do you know why the devil men eat people? They aren’t actually eating the people, they are eating the spirit energy, blood energy, soul energy, and spiritual energy within a person. The more they devour, the stronger they get!”

Yang Ye fell silent.

Meanwhile, Qin Chuan continued, “In this place, the first thing you should consider isn’t cultivating, but surviving. So long as you want to survive, you’ll grow stronger. There are only two types of people here, the living and the dead!”

He chuckled and continued, “Besides that, forget about fighting alone. I too wanted to fight alone when I first arrived here, but when others joined forces and ganged up on me, I realized that my thoughts were extremely foolish. You may be able to fight three or even five on your own, but can you fight 30 or 50?”

Yang Ye fell silent for a long time, and then he said, “I don’t like scheming against people!”

“There is no scheming!” Qin Chuan continued, “No one dared to do that in Sky Residence City, and no one will. Because if we don’t stay united, we’ll be annihilated by the other organizations and those mysterious beings!”

“Mysterious beings?” Yang Ye asked, “What’s that?”

Qin Chuan explained, “This area is covered by an endless mountain range. It’s called Hell Mountain Range. There are many mysterious and powerful beings throughout the boundless mountain range.” He looked Yang Ye in the eyes and placed emphasis on what he said next, “Extremely powerful!”

Yang Ye thought for a long time, and then he shook his head and vanished on the spot.

A wisp of disappointment flashed through Qin Chuan’s eyes. Suddenly, Yang Ye appeared in front of him and said seriously, “I’ll join Sky Residence City!”

Qin Chuan was slightly stunned, but it didn’t take long for him to look behind Yang Ye, and then his expression changed drastically. It was because a group of devil men had appeared around 3km behind, and there were over 30 of them.

Qin Chuan immediately ordered, “Retreat!”

He and all the others behind him didn’t hesitate to immediately turn around and leave.

Yang Ye naturally did the same. Even though he’d attained the Enlightened Realm, the weakest amongst those devil men was at the Enlightened Realm, and there were many Dao Realm experts amongst them too! If he was surrounded by them, he would definitely die!

Flee!

Yang Ye followed Qin Chuan and the others into the city, and then they swarmed out the back door.

A flat plain was before them, and it was simply endless!

As for behind them, there were over 30 devil men there, and those devil men refused to give up.

Qin Chuan suddenly gazed at Yang Ye and the old men by his side, “We’ll stay behind!”

Yang Ye was stunned, “Are you serious?”

Qin Chuan spoke solemnly, “If we don’t stay back and keep them busy, then while we’ll be able to escape, the others will die!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Qin Chuan and the three Dao Realm experts by his side stopped.

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and stopped as well. A chill couldn’t help but run down his spine as he watched those devil men dash towards them.

There were four Hear Dao Realm experts amongst them!

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and asked, “Are we going to fight them without holding back at all?”

Qin Chuan said, “We have to for now. We have to keep them busy. Our reinforcements will be here within 10 minutes!”

Yang Ye heaved a sigh of relief in his heart when he heard that there would be reinforcements. Even though he was a ruthless and fearless person, fighting 30 with just 5 was impossible!

Qin Chuan clenched his fists slowly, “Everyone! Get ready to risk your lives!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he stomped his right foot down and transformed into a beam of light that shot towards the devil men.

Yang Ye glanced at Qin Chuan and nodded slightly. This is how a true genius should act, unlike those pieces of trash from the 6 Greats that I met previously…

Yang Ye didn’t allow his thoughts to wander off, and he was about to attack. However, the devil man who led the group suddenly gazed at Yang Ye, “You’re the one who killed my people?”

Yang Ye gazed at the devil man, “It wasn’t me!”

“It was him!” Suddenly, another devil man spoke abruptly.

Yang Ye was speechless.

“Die!” The devil man who led the group transformed into a long black ray of light that shot forward in Yang Ye’s direction. Everywhere he passed, space was cracked open, and the powerful aura he emanated pushed Yang Ye backwards repeatedly!

He’s strong!

That was what Yang Ye thought at this moment.

Yang Ye didn’t dare to act carelessly, and a sword appeared in his grasp before rays of sword energy surged forward in an instant.

However, his sword energy was suppressed by the devil man’s aura!

Bang! Bang! Bang!

Yang Ye was pushed back repeatedly. But as his figure was pushed back, 10 ethereal swords appeared before the devil man. In an instant, countless rays of light enveloped him!

Boom!

However, an explosion resounded, and then the rays of light instantly vanished without a trace.

Yang Ye’s expression became extremely solemn when he witnessed this. That devil man was much stronger than he’d ever expected!

Even though the devil man was merely at the 2nd stage of the Enlightened Realm, his strength was absolutely comparable to a 4th stage Enlightened Realm expert!

Yang Ye didn’t dare act carelessly at all. He pressed his sword against his forehead, and then the Sword Domain appeared around him. An instant later, a ray of light flashed.

Split Second combined with the Sword Domain!

It wasn’t just swift to the limit, it was terrifyingly strong as well. Everywhere it passed, space was instantly sliced open.

Bang!

The devil man was blasted over 1km away!

Once he stopped himself, he glanced at his chest, and he saw an extremely deep injury there. Blood was seeping out incessantly from there too.

“How dare you!” The devil man’s face instantly turned ferocious, and his figure shot towards Yang Ye again.

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly before gradually turning ice cold. He was about to attack again when the sound of air being torn apart resounded from far away in the sky.

Boom!

An instant later, Yang Ye watched with astonishment as that devil man was slammed over 10km away.

“Who dares to touch my people?!” Suddenly, a furious shout resounded from behind Yang Ye!Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com
