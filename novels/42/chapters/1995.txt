Chapter 1996 – Who Said That?!

All of them were shocked, and they saw a hunched old man walking slowly in their direction.

Vigilance covered their faces.

Meanwhile, the old man stopped, scanned them, and shook his head.

Yang Ye and A’Man exchanged glances, and then Yang Ye said, “Senior, may I know what this place is?”

The old man gazed at Yang Ye, and then a wisp of surprise flashed through his eyes, “Interesting!”

Yang Ye was about to speak when the old man asked, “Do you know what this place is?”

Yang Ye shook his head.

The old man grinned, “You’ll find out soon!”

His grin was quite terrifying.

Yang Ye’s profound energy started to circulate within him. Suddenly, numerous souls appeared all around them.

There were hundreds of them!

A sword howl resounded abruptly, and then the souls in the surroundings stopped on the spot.

Yang Ye took a step forward and looked the old man in the eye, “We’re merely passing through and have no ill intent. We’ll take another way if this way isn’t open to us!”

The old man chuckled, “It’s too late!”

As soon as he said those words, the souls in the surroundings pounced at Yang Ye’s group.

Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!

Meanwhile, 10 rays of light flashed, and they sliced down at the souls. However, Yang Ye noticed to his astonishment that they remained completely unharmed before his sword energy!

What’s going on? Yang Ye frowned. Meanwhile, those souls had arrived before his group. Yang Ye didn’t have the time to think and immediately summoned the Sword Supreme. After that, he swung it forward!

Hiss!

Two souls in front of Yang Ye were instantly obliterated!

It works! Yang Ye was relieved. He swiftly waved his sword, and the souls around him instantly vanished!

“Watch out!” A’Man’s voice resounded abruptly.

As soon as she finished speaking, the old man appeared in front of Yang Ye. But Yang Ye was clearly on guard against this, and his sword was already stabbing forward.

However, his sword was caught by two fingers!

Two old fingers!

The surroundings fell silent. Yang Ye’s sword was extraordinarily sharp, so no one had expected it to be caught between someone’s fingers!

The old man said, “Your sword isn’t bad, your Sword Dao is even better. Interesting!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he shook his fingers slightly and Yang Ye was pushed over 1km away.

Yang Ye didn’t launch another attack. The old man’s strength far surpassed his own, so it was pointless to attack the old man again.

The old man sized up Yang Ye’s group, and then he gazed at Yang Ye, “You stay, the others leave!”

Qin Chuan and the others immediately walked over to Yang Ye. Their intentions were obvious!

The old man spoke indifferently, “If you don’t leave now, you won’t be able to later!”

A’Man was about to speak when Yang Ye shook his head, “Take them and leave!”

A’Man shook her head.

Yang Ye gazed at her and sent her a voice transmission, “I have a better chance at escaping if I’m alone.” He glanced at Qin Chuan and the others and continued, “This old man’s strength is far above my own. If he wanted to kill me, he wouldn’t have to go through so much trouble. Perhaps he thinks highly of my natural talent and wants me to become his disciple!”

Qin Chuan and the others exchanged glances. In the end, A’Man said, “We’ll be waiting outside!”

She immediately led the others out of this crimson expanse of land. But they didn’t go too far.

Once they left, Yang Ye gazed at the old man, “Senior, go ahead and tell me what you want!”

The old man replied, “Someone wants to meet you!”

Someone!

Once the old man finished speaking, he turned around and walked off ahead. Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and followed the old man. As they continued forward, Yang Ye noticed bones on the ground, a huge number of bones.

Dead people!

Yang Ye’s face fell.

It didn’t take long for Yang Ye to be led to a cave. The cave was extremely dark, and they walked around 15 minutes more before the old man stopped. He bowed, and then vanished from the cave!

Suddenly, Yang Ye’s sword escaped his grasp and flew off into the distance.

Yang Ye looked up. He saw a crystal casket floating there, and the sword was floating before the casket. The sword seemed to be trembling and responding to something.

A long time passed before a voice came from there, “The Sword Supreme is actually in your possession!”

Yang Ye spoke solemnly, “Senior, you recognize it?!”

The voice replied, “There were nine people who forged this sword. I’m one of them. So, why wouldn’t I?”

Yang Ye was stunned on the spot.

He didn’t know much about the Sword Supreme’s origins, and he merely knew that a few supreme experts had joined forces to forge it. Moreover, all those supreme experts could be addressed as progenitors!

But he hadn’t expected to actually meet one of them in the Dead Dimension!

Meanwhile, the sword flew back to Yang Ye, and the voice from the casket resounded once more, “You’re surprised, and I’m even more surprised. When she was forged, she had a benevolent and kind character. Even if her sword spirit was heavily injured by Shi Tian, her instinct is still present. So, she shouldn’t have chosen you!”

Yang Ye fell silent. Actually, it hadn’t chosen him when he first met it, and it had merely come to him because it wanted to stay within the Primordial Pagoda. As for what happened later on… In any case, it slowly fell for his tricks and stayed with him!

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts and said, “Senior, are you going to take it back?” Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“Take it back?” The voice replied, “Why would I do that? Since it chose you, it’s yours. Everything in this world has a spirit and destiny. Others should not interfere with it.”

Yang Ye glanced at the casket and said, “Senior, that is true. So, can I leave now?”

The voice asked, “Do you know why there are so many bones outside?”

Yang Ye shook his head.

The voice explained, “Greed. Both man and even demon beasts know greed. I left that red vapor outside to tell others that this place doesn’t want to be disturbed, and it isn’t safe. However, those people and demon beasts still come in here. Besides greed, it’s because they think they’ll be lucky.”

Yang Ye spoke solemnly, “Senior, what are you trying to say?”

The voice asked, “Do you know why we forged this sword?”

Yang Ye nodded slightly, “I heard it was for the fight against the god race!”

The voice replied, “Exactly. Then do you know what possessing this sword represents?”

Yang Ye chuckled, “Senior, I don’t, and I don’t want to know. I don’t like to be forced into something. If it stays with me, I control it, and not the other way around. If its sword spirit awakens, and its mission conflicts with my own intentions, then I’ll abandon it and we can go our separate ways.”

He had to kill the god race and protect the other races just because he had this sword?

No way!

Yang Ye would never do that!

The voice fell silent for a long time before it said, “Staying true to your heart! Not bad!”

Yang Ye asked, “According to my knowledge, this world is about to collapse. Aren’t you going to leave?”

The voice replied, “It is about to collapse, but it can’t harm me!”

Yang Ye was stunned speechless.

Meanwhile, the voice suddenly said, “I need your help with something!”

Yang Ye was about to speak when the voice continued, “There’s a race called the wing race in the large universe. If I’m not wrong, it has suffered decline by now. I want you to take something to them!”

Yang Ye asked, “Senior, why don’t you head back yourself?”

The voice chuckled, “This world is a cruel one. Have you heard about the fight between Paths? I think you should have. Because you’ve been swept into it as well. This battle is one that only ends with the death of the other party. After the war with the god race, my wing race lost, so it should retreat and enter into seclusion.”

She paused for a moment and continued, “Unfortunately, others may not allow us to just leave. Others can only truly rest easy when you’re dead, right? If I didn’t leave completely, then both me and my race would have been annihilated!”

The battle of Paths!

Yang Ye heard about it again, but he had no idea what it actually was!

Meanwhile, a black spatial ring appeared in front of Yang Ye, “Take this to the wing race and they’ll understand everything.”

Yang Ye didn’t hesitate to take it, “I’ll definitely pay them a visit if I’m able to leave this place!”

“I won’t make you do it for free!” Meanwhile, the voice said, “I can’t show myself now, and I can’t help you either. However, I have a little thing that I can give you.”

A pair of pitch black wings appeared before Yang Ye.

The voice explained, “The Divine Wings! It was made from the bones of a supreme expert from my wing race. As for its speed, you’ll find out once you try it!”

Yang Ye gazed at the wings. They were pitch black, and there were black bones on the back of it. Besides that, its edges were thin like the wings of a cicada and extremely sharp.

Yang Ye asked, “What rank is it at?”

“The Sage Rank!” The voice continued, “Try it!”

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and asked, “Can I try it outside?”

“Of course!” The voice continued, “You can leave whenever you want!”

Yang Ye cupped his fist to the casket and left.

Meanwhile, the hunched old man from before appeared below the casket, “Master, I don’t understand! He’s a pretty good host! If you live within him, it’ll take 10 years at most before he will become the best body for you to take control of!”

Suddenly, a voice resounded, “If you do that, both you and your master will vanish from this world!”

The old man’s expression changed drastically!

Who was that?!
