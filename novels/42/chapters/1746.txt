Chapter 1747 - Obliteration Sword Formation!

The Ku Clan and Ying Clan!

They were the strongest and most mysterious clans in the medium universe!

Of course, that wasn’t the main point! The main point was why they were helping Yang Xiao?

That was the question in everyone’s minds, and it was the question in both Yang Ye and Yang Lianshuang’s minds.

In the sky.

The group of ten on the left were led by an old man in luxurious robes. There was a small ‘赢’ character embroidered on the old man’s left chest.

He was an elder of the Ying Clan, Ying Wu. A peak 3rd stage True Realm expert. As for the nine old men by his side, all of them were 3rd stage True Realm experts as well. However, their auras weren’t as thick as his.

As for the group of ten on the right, it was led by an old man in linen robes. There was a small ‘枯’ character embroidered on the old man’s left chest,

He was an elder of the Ku Clan, Ku Po! 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

He was a peak 3rd stage True Realm expert as well. Similarly, the others behind him were 3rd stage True Realm experts!

Twenty 3rd stage True Realm experts!

With the addition of these True Realm experts, Yang Xiao’s side could be said to possess an absolute advantage over Yang Lianshuang’s side!

Meanwhile, Yang Lianshuang suddenly said, “Yang Xiao, you were actually able to make the Ku Clan and Ying Clan help you? If I’m not wrong, you definitely sacrificed something of the Yang Clan’s, right?”

Yang Xiao spoke coldly, “That’s my business!”

“Your business?” Yang Lianshuang suddenly laughed coldly, “Yang Xiao, I’m sure you realize that you’re inviting disaster, right?”

Yang Xiao looked her in the eyes, “If I’m not the Yang Clan’s patriarch, then it would be meaningless even if the Yang Clan is the number one clan in the medium universe!”

Yang Ye and Yang Lianshuang were entirely capable of threatening his position as patriarch. If he didn’t gain external support, it was very likely for his side to be crushed by Yang Lianshuang and Yang Ye’s joint forces. At that time, based on the enmity between him and Yang Ye, Yang Ye would never allow him to live!

So, he had no other choice but to agree to their conditions.

Even though it made the Yang Clan lose a lot, it was better than death!

Yang Lianshuang gazed at Yang Ye and asked, “You intend to leave, right?”

Yang Ye nodded.

She shook her head slightly, “It’s too late. You won’t make it in time even if you travel at full speed.”

Yang Ye fell silent for a moment and said, “You’re right. However, I still intend to head back there. But before I head back…”

His eyes suddenly turned blood red, “Before I head back, I’m going to kill Yang Xiao’s entire family!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he transformed into a ray of light that entered the group behind him.

“Stop him!” Yang Xiao was furious, and he charged at Yang Ye. As for the Ying Clan and Ku Clan’s experts in the sky, they charged at Yang Ye as well!

Roar!

Suddenly, a colossus appeared in the sky.

It was Qiong Qi!

At this moment, Qiong Qi was clearly much stronger than before. After he appeared there, a vicious aura swept out from him, and the True Realm experts charging at Yang Ye were instantly pushed over 1km back!

After that, the wings on his back spread open, and they were simply capable of blotting out the sky.

Qiong Qi hadn’t just grown much stronger, even his size was much larger!

“What is that monster?!” Ku Po frowned.

Qiong Qi didn’t waste his breath. He just charged at Ku Po’s group.

Ku Po and the others’ expressions changed when they saw such a huge colossus charge at them. They didn’t dare to attack Yang Ye anymore, and they joined forces against Qiong Qi instead.

Meanwhile, Yang Lianshuang obstructed Yang Xiao’s path.

Yang Lianshuang slowly clenched her fist. In an instant, arcs of lightning appeared all over her body. She looked Yang Xiao in the eyes and said, “Yang Xiao, you’re worse than I expected. You actually sought outside help for the Yang Clan’s own internal affairs. Forget it, I’ll cripple you myself!”

As soon as she finished speaking, she transformed into a bolt of lightning that flashed at Yang Xiao.

A wisp of viciousness flashed through Yang Xiao’s eyes, “Fine. Let’s put an end to this today!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he stomped his right foot down and charged at her.

Meanwhile, Ying Wu’s group appeared before Yang Ye when he was just about to charge into the group of Yang Xiao’s family members, and then they surrounded him.

Ying Wu sized up Yang Ye and said, “You killed two True Realm experts of my Ying Clan, right?”

Yang Ye glanced at Ying Wu, “I intend to kill a few more now!”

As soon as he finished speaking, his left wrist moved slightly, and then the expression of one of the True Realm experts instantly changed. He instantly appeared over 100m away, and a spatial rift had suddenly appeared where he was standing a moment ago!

At the same time, one of his ears was gone!

That True Realm expert glanced at Yang Ye, and his eyes were filled with fear. If he’d been just a little slower, he wouldn’t have lost an ear but half his body.

It had been absolutely swift to the point that even he couldn’t see it clearly. He could only rely on his instinct towards danger to flash to the side, and that had saved his life!

He wasn’t the only one, Ying Wu and the others had solemn expressions on their faces as well.

Yang Ye’s attack made them arouse a sense of danger!

Yang Ye glanced at that True Realm expert, and he wasn’t surprised. It was very difficult for his Split Second technique to kill a formidable True Realm expert. However, if one strike didn’t work, two strikes did the trick.

But this time, he hadn’t launched a second attack because he didn’t want to waste the profound energy that he’d just recovered!

Yang Ye waved his right hand, and the black Sword Chest appeared before him.

Meanwhile, Yang Xiao who was fighting Yang Lianshuang suddenly said, “Be careful of that Sword Chest! Don’t get careless!”

After all, Yang Ye had instantly killed four 3rd stage True Realm experts with it just now!

Even he was extremely fearful of that Sword Chest!

Ying Wu and the others immediately glanced at Yang Ye’s Sword Chest, and their eyes were filled with vigilance.

They hadn’t just heard of Yang Ye’s strength, they’d even witnessed it. So, they naturally didn’t dare to act carelessly!

Yang Ye glanced at them, and then he tapped the Sword Chest.

Om!

A sword howl resounded.

Ying Wu and the others’ expressions instantly changed when they heard the sword howl, and they moved over 30m back. At the same time, an invisible defensive barrier appeared before them.

However, there was no movement from the Sword Chest!

Yang Ye glanced at Ying Wu’s group, “Why are all of you so tense? I was just testing it!”

Ying Wu and the others’ expressions instantly became unsightly.

Suddenly, the Sword Chest in front of Yang Ye shook violently, and then six rays of black light flashed out from them.

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!

In an instant, the space in an area of 1km around Yang Ye was sliced up!

The Obliteration Sword Formation!

At this moment, the Obliteration Sword Formation was much stronger than when he utilized it earlier. Because Yang Ye’s heart was filled with the intent to kill, a boundless intent to kill. When the intent to kill appeared, his desire to destroy everything would be stronger, and that made the sword formation grow even stronger!

Space was like a rag that was being cut open at random by a pair of scissors!

After he activated the sword formation, Yang Ye immediately swallowed two Energy Pearls and looked towards the distance.

Meanwhile, the space there had returned to normal.

However, only five of the group of ten remained.

Ying Wu was still alive, but he wasn’t in a very good state. Because his arm had been sliced into numerous pieces. However, those pieces weren’t sliced off cleanly, so they just dangled from his shoulder. As for the others by his side, their bodies were covered in injuries. One of them who’d suffered comparatively severe injuries had been cut open at the stomach. If that attack had gone just a little deeper, his body would have been cut into two halves!

A single sword formation had instantly killed five True Realm experts!

Actually, the sword formation wasn’t in its original form anymore. Because Yang Ye had improved it. Or to be more precise, he was utilizing it in his own way. In other words, he had included the Laws he possessed when activating the sword formation!

That made the sword formation much faster, and its strength rose to a higher level!

It could be said that the sword formation was even stronger because of him!

Ying Wu and the others stared at Yang Ye. At this moment, their gazes were murderous. Of course, there was even more fear in their eyes!

Deep fear!

They had been very vigilant just now!

However, five of them had still been killed in an instant!

Five 3rd stage True Realm experts!

It had been done by a Zenith Realm expert!

If they hadn’t experienced it themselves, they would never believe that it was possible.

Ying Wu and the others didn’t attack, so Yang Ye naturally didn’t attack as well. He wanted to attack, of course. But at this moment, he couldn’t execute any sword techniques or the sword formation. Because he’d recovered less than 20% of his total profound energy reserves.

That was even because he was using the Energy Pearls which Snowy made. If he used other Energy Pearls, he would have no choice but to flee!

“Attack him!” Suddenly, Yang Xiao said, “That sword formation definitely exhausted a huge amount of his profound energy, so his profound energy has dried up by now. Your joint forces are entirely sufficient to kill him with ease!”

Ying Wu’s eyes narrowed slightly when he heard Yang Xiao, and then he gazed at Yang Ye. Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly took a step forward, and then he tapped the Sword Chest.

Om!

A sword howl resounded from it.

Ying Wu and the others’ expressions changed drastically, and they moved an entire 3km back!

Yang Ye looked up at them and spoke with astonishment, “What are all of you doing? My hand was just itchy! I was just scratching an itch!”

All of them were stunned speechless.
