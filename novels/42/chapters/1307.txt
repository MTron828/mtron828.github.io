Chapter 1308 – Let’s Go!

It was a pair of wings that was floating before Yang Ye. The wings were forged from numerous fine scales. The scales were completely translucent and smooth like a mirror.

The Void Rank!

Everyone here was shocked when they saw the wings. Obviously, they hadn’t expected Nie Tian to actually give Yang Ye a Void Rank treasure.

Isn’t he a little too generous?

Even Nie Qing hadn’t expected this. Besides shock, there was bewilderment in her eyes.

“Those wings are called Blink. They were made with the scales of the ancient auspicious beast, the Phoenix, and fragments of space. If you wear these wings, even I wouldn’t be able to catch up to you once it enhances the speed you already possess.” Nie Tian smiled, “You don’t have any worries now, right?”

“Of course!” Yang Ye smiled. He hesitated for a moment and said, “Senior Nie, when I head to the demon race’s territory, these subordinates of mine.... I’m sure you’re aware that some have irreconcilable enmity with me. Once I leave... if they....”

Nie Tian smiled and said, “Don’t worry, anyone who dares to touch the Slayer Pavilion is an enemy of my Nie Clan.”

Yang Ye gazed at Nie Tian for a short while before he smiled, “I’ll head out tomorrow!”

Nie Tian smiled, “I’ll be waiting for your good news!”

“I’m heading off to make preparations!” As soon as he finished speaking, he cupped his fists to Nie Tian and left with the experts of the Slayer Pavilion.

As he gazed at Yang Ye’s vanishing figure, Nie Tian still had a smile on his face, but there was a slightly unusual expression in his eyes.

After he left the Hall of the Righteous, it didn’t take long for a middle aged man to arrive before Yang Ye’s group, and the middle aged man said, “I’m the manager of the Nie Clan, and I received the patriarch’s orders to bring all of you to your rooms.” As he spoke, he shot towards the distance.

Yang Ye and the others immediately followed after him. It didn’t take long for the middle aged man to lead them to a small mountain. There was only a single palace on the mountain. Once he brought them to the palace’s entrance, the middle aged man cupped his fist to Yang Ye’s group before vanishing into the sky.

Once they entered the hall within the palace, Yang Ye gazed at Zi’er. She nodded slightly and waved her hands gently. In an instant, the space around them shook, and then a moment passed before she looked at Yang Ye, “Space has been fortified. No one can sweep this area with their divine sense. Even if someone can, I’ll be able to detect it as soon as it happens!”

Yang Ye nodded, and then he glanced at Qian Lankong and the others, “Do you have anything to say?”

Qian Lankong spoke in a low voice, “Something is off!”

Shui Linlang added as well, “Something is not off indeed!”

Yang Ye nodded. He felt the same as well. Nie Tian had actually not hesitated to give him a Void Rank treasure just to make him investigate the demon race. Did Nie Tian really do it for the human race? In any case, Yang Ye didn’t really believe it. However, if Nie Tian had other objectives, then what were they?

To kill him?

But Nie Tian had no reason to do so. Because there was no enmity between him and the Nie Clan.

Yang Ye pondered deeply for a long time before he waved his right hand, and he withdrew the wings, Blink. He gazed at the violet mink, and she nodded before placing her palm on it. A long time passed before her expression suddenly changed, and she gazed at Yang Ye, “There’s a problem!”

As expected! Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly as he asked, “What is it?”

She replied in a low voice, “There’s a restriction within the spatial fragments. It’s hidden very well, and even I almost missed it. That old fellow actually intends to stab you in the back!”

Yang Ye asked, “What restriction?”

Zi’er shook her head slightly, “I don’t know. But it’s definitely either one to control you or destroy you.”

Yang Ye’s face became gloomy. There was no enmity between him and the Nie Clan, but Nie Tian actually wanted to harm him! But he couldn’t figure out why Nie Tian wanted to do that!

Meanwhile, Qian Lankong suddenly said, “He probably wants to control you!”

Yang Ye gazed at Qian Lankong to indicate that she should continue.

Qian Lankong spoke solemnly, “Everyone knows that based on your natural talent and potential, you’ll definitely grow into a peerless expert in the future. If the Nie Clan can control you, it would represent that the Nie Clan would have a peerless expert in the future. My guess is that it isn’t just a restriction to control you, it’s a destructive restriction as well. Once you go against the Nie Clan, they’ll be able to strike first....”

When she spoke up to this point, Qian Lankong gazed at Yang Ye, “Your natural talent and potential are terrifying. So, it’s like a preventative measure of the Nie Clan’s. As for the Void Rank treasure. What a joke! If they can take control of you, then not to mention one, they would even be willing to use 10.”

Meanwhile, Shui Linlang added, “If I’m not wrong, Nie Tian knew that you wouldn’t just agree to head to the demon race’s territory, so he’d placed that restriction within Blink in advance, and then waited for you to raise your conditions. Actually, even if you didn’t raise any conditions, he would definitely make up an excuse to give the wings to you.”

“The Nie Clan!” A cold smile curled up on the corners of Yang Ye’s mouth. His principle in life was to only attack when offended. The Nie Clan was scheming against him, so he would naturally not let the matter rest.

Qian Lankong and the others fell silent. Not to mention Yang Ye who was absolutely vengeful, even they were quite displeased. Yang Ye represented the Slayer Pavilion right now, so the Nie Clan’s actions were like expressing contempt upon the Slayer Pavilion! However, they were very well aware that they could do nothing even if they knew that the Nie Clan was scheming against them.

It was none other than because the Slayer Pavilion’s strength couldn’t compare to the Nie Clan!

Yang Ye would naturally not attack the Nie Clan right now, he wasn’t that foolish. Presently, he had the Slayer Pavilion and Sword Alliance standing behind him, so acting in that way would definitely bring calamity upon the Sword Alliance and the Slayer Pavilion.

Meanwhile, Qian Lankong asked, “Are you still going to utilize those wings?”

“Of course!” A slight smile curled up on the corners of Yang Ye’s mouth, “It’s a Void Rank treasure. Why wouldn’t I use it?”

Qian Lankong spoke softly, ‘But the restriction....”

Yang Ye shook his head and said, “That’s an insignificant issue.” As far as he was concerned, the restriction was insignificant indeed. He just had to toss the wings into the tiny vortex, and then all restrictions would be obliterated. However, he didn’t make the tiny vortex do so right away because he would alarm the Nie Clan if he did that right now.

In any case, so long as he formed a spiritual link with Blink, then he could instantly teleport it into the tiny vortex. So, he didn’t have to worry about the restrictions being activated.

Yang Ye didn’t hesitate to flick a strand of blood into the wings. As soon as that happened, the wings transformed into a ray of light that entered Yang Ye’s body. Yang Ye issued a command in his heart, and then a pair of wings instantly appeared on his shoulders before his figure floated up into the air.

Yang Ye pondered deeply for an instant, and then he suddenly vanished on the spot. In an instant, the entire hall was filled with Yang Ye’s figures. Of course, they were afterimages, but because he was too swift, the afterimages looked exactly like him. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Qian Lankong and the others were stunned by this scene.

Yang Ye’s existing speed was extremely terrifying, and now that it was enhanced by these wings.... It could be said that if Yang Ye was said to be flying, then Voiders were just walking!

Simply speaking, his current speed was absolutely superior to Voiders.

A short while later, Yang Ye stopped, and there was a wisp of excitement in his eyes as he gazed at the seemingly real afterimages in the surroundings. His current space completely crushed the speed of Voiders! It could be said that if he wanted to assassinate a Voider now, then it would really be beyond easy. He was even 70 to 80% confident that he could kill a Voider at Senior Yuan’s level with just a single attack!

Even if he didn’t try to assassinate an expert at Senior Yuan’s level, he was confident in being able to defeat such an expert by just relying on Blink and the Phantom Shield, and he felt that he even had a chance to kill such an expert!

If one’s strength wasn’t sufficient, it could be supplemented with equipment!

Qian Lankong glanced at Yang Ye. Needless to say, Yang Ye was going to be absolutely godly with the Phantom Shield and Blink. Especially when Yang Ye was skilled in assassinations as well. It could be said that even if the master of Slayer Pavilion was brought back to life, his ability in assassination would be absolutely inferior to Yang Ye. It couldn’t be helped because once speed arrived at a certain level, then all techniques were useless.

Yang Ye withdrew the wings, and then gazed at Qian Lankong, “All of you be careful while I’m gone. Don’t put down your guard at all. Understand?”

Qian Lankong asked, “You’re still going?”

“Of course!” Yang Ye nodded. Actually, he wanted to go have a look as well. He wanted to see the demon race’s strength. If it really far surpassed the strength of the entire human race, then he had to think of a way out for the Sword Alliance and Slayer Pavilion.

One should always prepare for the worst.

Qian Lankong said, “We’ll be very safe while you’re safe.”

Yang Ye smiled, “Don’t worry. Now that I have these wings, I’m confident that I’ll be able to escape and get back here even if I’m discovered in the central area of the demon race’s territory.

Qian Lankong said, “Be careful!”

Yang Ye nodded, gave them orders about some other things, and then asked them to leave.

Only Yang Ye and Zi’er remained here. Of course, Snowy who was still sleeping was here as well.

Zi’er suddenly said, “You wouldn’t be thinking about leaving me behind, right?”

Yang Ye chuckled, took her hand, and said, “I told you that I’ll never leave you behind, no matter what. Even if it’s death, we’ll die together!”

Zi’er walked over to Yang Ye and hugged him before she spoke softly, “I won’t let you leave me behind either!”

Yang Ye treated her as one of the closest people to him, and she did the same!

Yang Ye lowered his head and pecked her on the forehead, “I’ll never do that!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Zi’er suddenly looked up at him, and then she stood on the tips of her toes and wrapped her arms around his neck. After that, she kissed his lips.

Yang Ye’s figure stiffened. Meanwhile, Zi’er quickly released him and lowered her head. Her little rosy cheeks were red like the sunset.

Yang Ye chuckled as he gazed at the embarrassed look she had, and then he embraced her, “Let’s go to the demon race.”

...

Dawn had just arrived when Yang Ye left Heaven Pillar Peak with Zi’er and Snowy.

The Hall of the Righteous.

Nie Qing stood by Nie Tian’s side as she spoke, “Yang Ye has left.”

Nie Tian nodded.

“Blink is a precious treasure of our Nie Clan, and it belongs to you....” Nie Qing hesitated to finish speaking.

Nie Tian waved his hand and said, “A treasure for a future expert.... We profited from this exchange.”
