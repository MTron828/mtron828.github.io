Erya touched her horns and was quite stunned.

“Am I going to be like Oxxy? Wouldn’t I look really ugly?” Erya muttered, and then she shook her head and ran outside.

Yang Ye was still practicing with the Sword Gourd high above in the clouds.

Yang Ye had gotten addicted to practicing with the Sword Gourd. Because he noticed that it was really powerful, and if it was used to launch surprise attacks, it would be absolutely matchless!

“Dead before seeing anyone!” That was what the Sword Scroll called it.

However, Yang Ye’s current speed wasn’t really sufficient to soundlessly kill a Limitbreaker Realm expert!

Train!

Train to the death!

Needless to say, Yang Ye’s improvement was very swift with Sword Scroll’s guidance, and it could be described as being capable of rivaling the speed of gods.

Yang Ye felt quite a bit of admiration toward Sword Scroll. Sword Scroll’s knowledge in the Sword Dao was much, much greater than his own. Especially some minor techniques, it was exactly these minor techniques that were extremely helpful to him.

At this moment, he understood why Tian Xiu said Sword Scroll would be able to help him in the future!

In the sky, Yang Ye sat on a cloud while Snowy stood on his shoulder, and Sword Scroll and Erya were by his side. Besides that, there was Oxxy who had an axe on his back.

Presently, Oxxy was using the Primordial Axe of Creation, and Sword Scroll had even taught Oxxy three moves. According to her, they were demon techniques. In Eternal Universe, many great demons possessed various demon divine techniques and demon techniques. These demons who possessed such techniques were extremely terrifying.

Simply speaking, Oxxy was growing stronger and stronger!

Sword Scroll glanced at the Sword Gourd by Yang Ye’s waist, and then she waved her hand. It immediately descended into her grasp. She spun it around and said, “This Sword Gourd has another extremely formidable ability, and it’s the essence of this Sword Gourd. It is its limitlessness.”

“Limitlessness?” Yang Ye said, “Be a little more specific!”

Sword Scroll nodded and said, “Place your Sword Supreme and Sword Precursor within it, then so long as you possess enough profound energy, mental strength, and soul energy, you can instantly launch two flying swords! Two flying swords that can kill any enemy! Moreover, two isn’t the limit of this Sword Gourd. If you have ten swords, you can launch ten of them at once, even a hundred. Just think about it. If a hundred swords are instantly launched during battle, how terrifying would that be?”

She paused for a moment and continued, “However, the Sword Gourd’s requirements toward swords is extremely high. If Snowy hadn’t increased the strength of their spirits, those three ancient swords within it would have shattered after being launched just four or five times by the Sword Gourd. So, if you have the opportunity, collect more good swords. Of course, the important matter at hand for you is to cultivate and strive to improve the speed of your sword to your current limits!”

“My limits?” Yang Ye asked, “What are my limits?”

She grinned, “Instantly killing a Two World Realm expert, that’s your current limit!”

Instantly killing Two World Realm experts!

Yang Ye fell silent.

How fast would his swords have to be in order to accomplish that? And how strong would they have to be too?

Meanwhile, Sword Scroll turned around, “You must be strong, extremely strong. You understand what I mean!”

She vanished on the spot once she finished speaking.

Yang Ye fell silent for a long time, and then he shook his head and smiled. He looked at Snowy who was on his shoulder, and she was staring at the Sword Gourd. Obviously, she wanted to play with it.

Yang Ye waved his right hand, and the Sword Gourd appeared before Snowy. He smiled, “Play if you want to. But you can only play for an hour!”

Snowy immediately hugged Yang Ye’s head and kissed him on the forehead. After that, she grabbed the Sword Gourd and slapped it.

A sword howl resounded!

A ray of light tore through the clouds, and if one looked up from down below, one would notice that the entire sky had been cut open!

From then on, besides cultivating, Yang Ye played with Snowy and Erya. Of course, he did one more thing, mutual cultivation!

This period of time was absolutely fun for Yang Ye. Every single session of mutual cultivation didn’t just give him physical pleasure, there was mental pleasure as well. Of course, the most important aspect was the increase in strength. After cultivating in the Yin Yang Scroll, every session of mutual cultivation gave him a huge increase in strength. He was certain that if he stopped suppressing his cultivation right now, he would rise to the peak of the World Lord Realm! However, he suppressed that impulse!

Suppression!

Suppress until he couldn’t anymore!

Now, he was very well aware that he could still suppress it, and he could do it for a very long time!

Outside the Primordial Pagoda.

After they received his Eternal Immortal Crystals, the North Charge Sect and Skywalker Sect did everything they could to locate An Nanjing. They’d practically sent out all their eyes and ears, and they even used many other avenues to search for An Nanjing.

However, they weren’t able to find any information on her.

In the hall of North Charge Sect, there were only three people here. Yang Ye, Ye Tianxing, and Li Yuan.

Ye Tianxing laughed bitterly, “Young Brother Yang, I’m sorry. We haven’t been able to find any leads in the last 10 days!”

Yang Ye shook his head slightly, “It’s not your fault. Someone has concealed her from the workings of the heavens, so it’s normal that you’re unable to locate her!”

Ye Tianxing and Li Yuan exchanged glances, and they saw bitterness in each other’s eyes. If they could find An Nanjing for Yang Ye, he would definitely owe them a huge favor!

Unfortunately, even with all the resources they possessed, they still weren’t able to locate any information on her. Moreover, they even wondered if she really was in Divine Martial World!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye stood up, “I think it’s time I took my leave.”

Ye Tianxing asked, “You’re leaving?”

Yang Ye nodded, “Thanks for your hospitality, but I’d like to search around at other places.”

Ye Tianxing hesitated for a moment and said, “You can try Divine Martial Capital. There’s a place called the Divine Martial Sect there, and it’s the number one sect of this world. Its ancestor, Xiao Shenwu, went to Eternal Border in the past. I heard he even made a great name for himself over there. If you’re able to gain their help, then you’ll have a very good chance of locating your friend if she’s in Divine Martial World.”

Yang Ye asked, “The Divine Martial Sect?”

Ye Tianxing nodded, “It enjoys a great amount of prestige in Divine Martial World, and it’s the largest sect here. If they give the order to search for someone, countless smaller sects will work with them. However, it’s probably not easy to obtain their help! But I don’t think you’re an ordinary person, so you can give it a try.”

If the strength Yang Ye revealed wasn’t that unfathomable, he wouldn’t have made such a suggestion. Because the Divine Martial Sect was the largest sect in Divine Martial World, so they wouldn’t even bother to entertain the requests of any ordinary person!

The Divine Martial Sect!

Yang Ye nodded, committed it to memory, and then cupped his fist, “Farewell!”

Once he finished speaking, he turned around and left. He saw someone outside the hall, it was Ye Xiaotian. Yang Ye hesitated for a moment, and then he flicked a sword over to her!

It was one of those three ancient swords!

Yang Ye smiled, “During this time that you were practicing, I noticed you didn’t have a suitable sword. I obtained this one by chance, don’t bring shame to it!”

Yang Ye transformed into a ray of light and vanished on the spot.

The others here were stunned on the spot.

A sword!

The sword in front of her was a Pseudo Divine Treasure!

A real Pseudo Divine Treasure!

The entire North Charge Sect only had one of them! Yet now, Yang Ye had casually given her another!

Ye Tianxing and Li Yuan exchanged glances, and there was a wisp of shock in their eyes. Of course, there was greater pleasant surprise in Ye Tianxing’s eyes!

Ye Xiaotian was stunned for quite a long time, and then she stretched out her hand and grabbed it. The sword shook slightly, and then she hurriedly said, “I-I’ll take good care of you. We’ll travel the worlds and carry out righteous deeds. Alright?”

The ancient sword remained silent.

Meanwhile, Ye Tianxing suddenly asked, “Xiaotian, did he say anything about his origins?”

She put the sword away, hesitated for a moment, and said, “He said that it’s best if we don’t have too much ties with him. He said it’s for our own good.”

Ye Tianxing and Li Yuan exchanged glances. In the end, Li Yuan shook his head and sighed, “He possesses such strength at his young age, and his aura of slaughter is too thick. While he doesn’t seem like a bad person, he isn’t anyone ordinary. Just as he said, it’s best if we stay out of the kind of circle he’s in. Otherwise, we’ll die before we know it!”

Ye Tianxing nodded, “Indeed. Sigh, I wonder who he is!”

Ye Xiaotian suddenly grinned. Because Yang Ye had told her that she could go look for him in Eternal Border when she was free.

Eternal Border! Yang Ye was from Eternal Border!

Suddenly, a black robed man appeared in the hall, and they were shocked by the sight of him.

Ye Tianxing sized up the man and asked ,”May I know who you are?”

The man spoke indifferently, “Do you know where Yang Ye is going?” He was ordered to follow Yang Ye, but Yang Ye had been too fast when he left North Charge Sect just now, so he hadn’t been able to keep up at all. Coupled with the fact that he didn’t dare to get too close to Yang Ye, he’d lost Yang Ye. Thus, he had no choice but to come here and ask about Yang Ye.

Yang Ye!

Ye Tianxing and Li Yuan exchanged glances, and then Ye Tianxing shook his head, “I don’t know!”

“You don’t know?” The black robed man’s voice became quite cold, and then he looked at Ye Xiaotian, “You just had to gain guidance in the Sword Dao from him. What can you do after learning it anyway?”

As soon as he finished speaking, he waved his right hand at her from afar.

Hiss! Hiss!

She hadn’t even been able to react before her arms fell to the ground, and blood sprayed out like fountains!
