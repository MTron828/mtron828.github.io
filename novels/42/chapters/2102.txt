Chapter 2103 – Mysterious Figure!

The Sword Ruins!

To the Sword Ruins!

Yang Ye didn’t stay in Hidden Dragon city, and he left immediately. As far as he was concerned, it was just as Yang Lianshuang had said. He had to head to the Sword Ruins as soon as possible and help the Sword Supreme’s spirit recover. So long as it recovered, he was practically safe unless a progenitor acted against him.

The Sword Ruins wasn’t in the Void Dimension or the large universe, it was in an independent pocket of space.

It was jointly created by the progenitors of the four paths.

The god race had been so strong that even the four paths didn’t dare to go head-on against it all those years ago. So, they had forged the Sword Supreme in secret.

In order to get to the Sword Ruins, he had to get to the Sky Dimension first. There was a teleportation formation that led to the Sword Ruins there.

The Sky Dimension!

Yang Ye traveled to the Sky Dimension in secret.

It couldn’t be helped because he had to keep a low profile now.

All along the way, he noticed that the entrances of some cities had a portrait of him. So long as anyone had information about his whereabouts, they could receive 100,000 immortal crystals as compensation. It could be said that all the races were serious about killing him.

…

On a boundless mountain range of unknown name, one of the mountains here was very striking. It towered into the sky, and it could be seen even from extremely far away.

Heaven Secret Mountain.

It was the renowned Heaven Secret Mountain.

Ordinary people may have never heard of it, but its name reverberated in the ears of the stronger organizations of the large universe. Because there was an organization on Heaven Secret Mountain, Heaven Secret Hall.

Heaven Secret Hall!

It was an organization on par in reputation with Martial Emperor Academy. But unlike Martial Emperor Academy, it was much more mysterious. Because the way it recruited was different, they took the initiative to search the world for people to recruit. Besides natural talent, their recruits had to possess a special ability.

Some people were born with special abilities, and it wasn’t rare in the large universe.

There was a bamboo forest at the back of Heaven Secret Hall, and there was a bamboo house deep within it. An old man in linen robes was seated on a chair in front of the bamboo house. His eyes were closed, and he was smoking from a big pipe.

Suddenly, a middle aged man in a golden robe appeared before the bamboo house. There was a lifelike golden dragon on the golden robe.

The middle aged man said, “Yang Ye’s location!”

The old man opened his eyes, glanced at the middle aged man, and shook his head, “There’s something in his possession that’s concealing him from the heavens. Ask someone else!”

The middle aged man replied, “A million immortal crystals!”

The old man shook his head again, “It isn’t worth it.”

The middle aged man’s eyes narrowed slightly, “Two million!”

The old man gazed at the middle aged man, “Looks like all of you are really determined to kill that kid!”

The middle aged man closed his eyes and didn’t provide any answer.

“Three million!” Meanwhile, the old man stood up abruptly, “Three million, and my Heaven Secret Hall will be willing to help again! The price is fixed!”

The middle aged man glanced at the old man and flicked a spatial ring over.

The old man smiled, “Joining forces makes all of you so generous! You’ll have the information in two hours.”

The middle aged man turned around and left.

Once he left, the old man waved his right hand slightly. In an instant, a huge Go board appeared around him. There were three black turtle shells on it. The old man tapped his finger forward, and those shells trembled slightly before starting to move. A long time passed before the old man frowned slightly, “The Sky Dimension? He’s heading to the Sky Dimension?”

Suddenly, the old man’s expression changed…

Bang!

The Go board suddenly exploded apart, and the three turtle shells cracked open as well.

“Who did that?!” The old man glanced at the surroundings while the desire to kill filled his eyes.

Meanwhile, a voice resounded, “The Heaven Secret Hall should stop interfering in Yang Ye’s business from now on!”

The old man looked over, “Just because you said so?”

Suddenly, a man appeared not too far away, and he walked slowly in the old man’s direction.

Bang!

A moment later, the old man’s body exploded apart. However, he wasn’t dead because his soul was still intact. But at this moment, the old man was absolutely shocked.

He was at the peak of the Sage Realm!

It could be said that he was one of the top experts in this world besides the progenitors. But at this moment, he’d lost his body in just a single collision! The most terrifying part was that his opponent was no progenitor.

It was a Sage too!

Meanwhile, the man stopped and said, “You asked for that, trash. If I wasn’t keeping someone busy, I would have annihilated your Heaven Secret Hall. If you be a busybody again, I’ll make all 372 members of our Heaven Secret Hall eat shit! I’ll make them eat shit until they die!”

He turned around and added, “What a waste of my fucking time!”

He vanished on the spot once he finished speaking.

The old man fell silent for a long time. In the end, he looked up into the sky while bewilderment filled his eyes, “An armless man? When has such an expert existed in the large universe? Why didn’t my Heaven Secret Hall receive any information about him? Who is he?”

It could be said that the Heaven Secret Hall possessed information about most experts in the large universe, and it wouldn’t let any known experts slip by. However, the Heaven Secret Hall had no information about the armless man.

The old man frowned deeply.

Suddenly, a woman appeared.

The old man turned to look at her, and she spoke indifferently, “I told you not to interfere in Yang Ye’s business! Only the progenitors have the right to interfere in his business, and you don’t!”

The old man spoke solemnly, “What is his true background?!”

She closed her eyes slowly, “I don’t know!”

The old man’s eyes narrowed slightly, “Even the god race doesn’t know?”

The woman before him was the strategist of the god race, the woman in a white dress.

The woman spoke indifferently, “His background can be considered to be ordinary, and if there is anything extraordinary about him, it’s that there are three types of karma coiled around him. No, there should be more than three now. That existence from the Dao Path probably never expected the person he chose would be linked in such a complicated web of relationships. Of course, with his strength, he’s naturally able to forcefully sever all of those strands of karma. However, the Dao Path stresses upon letting the Dao take its natural course, and it’s his Dao too. So, he won’t forcefully interfere with the Heaven Dao’s path, and he won’t break its rules either. Moreover, he won’t take action now as well. After all, this current era is one of destruct…”

She stopped abruptly at this point.

The old man glanced at her and said, “What is that existence from the Dao Path planning? Everyone knows Yang Ye was chosen by him, even the other races. Yet now, they are pursuing him with the intent to kill, but he isn’t doing anything?”

“He isn’t?” She chuckled, “If he isn’t, Yang Ye would have been dead a long time ago. Don’t you understand? He’s the reason the progenitors of the Buddhist Path, Weapon Path, and Confucianist Path haven’t taken action and seized those treasures from Yang Ye. They have to abide by the rules while he’s alive, and if they don’t… Hah! Just think about it, if a progenitor decides to stop abiding by the rules, can any of the paths endure the consequences of that?”

She combed her hair gently and continued, “All he can do is restrain the other paths and stop them from acting against Yang Ye. As for the rest, it depends on Yang Ye himself. After all, metal must be tempered thousands of times through flames to become a sword.”

The old man fell silent for a long time before he asked, “Who was that?”

She suddenly asked, “Do you think that’s his main body?”

The old man’s pupils constricted, “What do you mean?”

She grinned, “That was just a strand of his divine sense!”

“Impossible!” The old man’s voice suddenly grew loud, “It’s impossible for the divine sense of a Sage to be so strong! It’s absolutely impossible!”

“I thought it was impossible too!” She closed her eyes slowly, “However, the facts prove it. Your Heaven Secret Hall has records on the supreme geniuses of the large universe throughout history. So, let me ask you something. Who is known to possess the best natural talent in our large universe?”

The old man fell silent for a short moment and said, “The Void Spirit Maiden. According to legend, she was born before the universe. She’s like an ordinary person before reaching adulthood, but once she does reach adulthood and the Void Spirit Energy within her awakens, then she…”

“The only way to kill her is to obliterate the entire universe!” Meanwhile, the woman in a white dress continued, “Actually, I really admire Master Heaven Secret. Even my god race had very few records of the previous history from before this universe. However, he was able to find out so much. He really is worthy of respect. Anyway, is he not here?”

The old man laughed bitterly, “Our ancestor hasn’t shown himself for almost 100 years.”

She nodded, “I understand. So back to what we were speaking about. There are many people in this world who can’t be judged by convention, and that person you just met is one of them.”

The old man spoke solemnly, “The Void Spirit Maiden is just a legend!”

The woman in a white dress chuckled and didn’t speak further. After all, no one would be happy after being defeated by just a strand of divine sense. Or it should be said that it would be difficult to accept.

Meanwhile, the old man asked, “What does your god race want from me?”

She spoke softly, “Aren’t all of them looking for us?”

The old man asked, “And?”

She smiled, “You can help us reveal our location to them!”

The old man’s eyes narrowed, “What do I get out of it?”

She smiled, “You don’t have to die!” Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

As soon as she finished speaking, five white robed old men appeared here.

All of them were Sages.

The old man spoke solemnly, “My ancestor isn’t dead!”

She walked slowly towards the bamboo house, “If he dares to show himself, then we’ll kill him too!”

A wisp of ridicule arose on the corners of the old man’s mouth, “Does your god race even have the ability to do that?”

She gazed at the old man, “All those years ago, all the races and the four paths had a total of 1,693 Sages and 9 Progenitors. But how many Sages are left after that battle? How many Progenitors are left?”

The old man’s face grew extremely unsightly.

He didn’t know how many progenitors were left after that battle, but he knew that all the races and the four paths included only had less than 100 Sages left in total! Moreover, some of those races even fell into decline and gradually vanished from the large universe.

The woman placed her hands behind her back and walked into the bamboo house, and then she spoke softly, “Once this battle is over, how many Sages will the other races have left?”
