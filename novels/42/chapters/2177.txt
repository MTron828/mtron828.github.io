Chapter 2178 – The Large Universe! Perish!

It was a woman who stood before Yang Ye, a woman in a red dress!

Her hand immediately shot backward when she saw him.

She was none other than the ancient cultivator from Moment Mountain who Yang Ye had met in the lower universe. Yang Ye had met her again in the Dead Dimension, and he’d never seen her in the large universe again. He hadn’t expected to meet her here.

She spoke solemnly, “It’s you!”

Yang Ye glanced at her, “Your Evil Alliance is behind the Flame Sect?”

She glanced at him and nodded. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Yang Ye spoke indifferently, “Looks like your Evil Alliance wants to cause trouble in the Human Dimension!”

She spoke solemnly, “We have no intention to become enemies with you.”

Yang Ye laughed coldly, “The Flame Sect has been plundering spirit energy and immortal stones, yet you say that?”

Suddenly, she waved her right hand, and the middle aged man’s body exploded apart.

She gazed at Yang Ye, “Is that enough?”

Yang Ye wasn’t someone she could offend right now!

While the Evil Alliance had some strength, but not to mention them, even the three paths were probably unwilling to rashly offend Yang Ye!

Yang Ye looked her in the eyes, “Tell the Evil Progenitor of your Evil Alliance to stop causing trouble in my Human Dimension. Otherwise, I’ll annihilate the Evil Alliance.”

Yang Ye turned around and left.

Suddenly, she said, “I have some advice for you.”

Yang Ye stopped, and turned around to look at her. She said, “Hand over the Sprite Lord, and you can go anywhere you want. Otherwise, you may not last these three months. It’s just advice, and I have no intent to threaten you.”

Yang Ye asked, “What? Your Evil Alliance covets the Sprite Lord too?”

She remained silent.

Yang Ye smiled, “Since I started out in Profounder Continent, I’ve had so many enemies, but have I ever feared anyone? Three months. Let me see if I die, or this large universe perishes after these three months!”

Yang Ye vanished into the sky once he finished speaking.

The woman shook her head, “What a madman!”

…

Yang Ye returned to Nature Sacred Grounds. The atmosphere here was quite heavy.

While no wars had occurred, they were very well aware that everyone had their gazes on the human race, and war would come, sooner or later.

Once he returned to Nature Sacred Ground, Yang Ye entered the Primordial Pagoda.

Cultivate!

This time, he didn’t cultivate his sword techniques, and he used the Bloodsoul Pearl instead! He wanted to absorb it and improve his slaughter intent.

Time trickled by. Two months passed!

During this time, Yang Ye had just been cultivating while Yang Lianshuang dealt with everything in the Human Dimension. As for the spirit energy in Nature Sacred Ground, it had started to dry up as well. But Snowy restored it!

The news of Snowy restoring the spirit energy here quickly spread through the entire large universe!

The Sprite Lord!

At this moment, everyone committed that name to their memories.

Madness!

At this instant, countless people and organizations went mad because of it.

Get the Sprite Lord and live!

No one knew who started saying that, but it spread throughout the large universe.

Who was the greatest barrier to obtaining the Sprite Lord?

It wasn’t the human race, it was Yang Ye!

Yang Ye was the biggest barrier, so another saying arose.

Kill Yang Ye, get the Sprite Lord, and live!

Yang Ye was still cultivating, and he ignored the outside world.

Just like that, time trickled by, and two more weeks passed swiftly. Now, the entire large universe had started to fall into chaos. The enmity between all races grew deeper, and even the most stable human race started to fall into chaos. While experts were stopping it incessantly, if people wanted to survive, cultivate, and extend their lifespans, then they needed immortal crystals. They couldn’t survive without them.

For the sake of their survival, many experts of the human race started to cause trouble.

The conflict between everyone grew more and more intense.

As for the time limit the Alliance of All gave Yang Ye, it was almost up.

…

Martial Emperor Academy.

The vice dean walked into An Nanjing’s room and bowed slightly to her.

She opened her eyes, “Go on!”

The vice dean said, “Besides those three you killed, seven other Sages are willing to take your side and obey your command. As for the rest, they’ve left the academy!”

An Nanjing nodded, “Let’s go!”

The vice dean asked, “Where?”

An Nanjing said, “The Human Dimension!”

The vice dean asked, “Are you really going to bet the entire academy?”

She gazed at him, “The academy doesn’t have to come!”

She vanished on the spot once she finished speaking.

The vice dean laughed bitterly. Suddenly, a voice resounded in his mind, “Listen to her!”

The vice dean was shocked, and then he stopped hesitating and left.

…

The Weapon Path.

Above the river deep within the bamboo forest, the Weapon Progenitor sat cross-legged in midair while the Buddhist Progenitor was seated not too far away from him. The Sovereign of Sky, Demon God, Spirit God, Devil Monarch, Shaman Emperor, and Barbaric King were around them!

Besides the Sovereign of Sky, all of them were halfway into the Progenitor Realm!

The Weapon Progenitor glanced at them, “Since you’re all here, I presume you’ve made your decision. So, I won’t say more.”

“Can I join too?” Suddenly, a voice resounded.

They looked over and saw a woman in a violet dress floating over.

It was none other than the Pavilion Master of Nether Pavilion, Shao Siyou!

The Weapon Progenitor frowned slightly, “A clone?”

She smiled, “My main body can come at any moment!”

The Weapon Progenitor’s frown eased up, and he nodded slightly, “Welcome!”

“Then count me in too!” Another voice resounded from afar.

It was a middle aged man with crimson red hair, and he emanated a dense evil aura. It was the Evil Progenitor of the Evil Alliance.

He was a progenitor level expert as well!

Besides the four paths there naturally were other progenitors. However, they kept a rather low profile in comparison, and they practically never showed themselves in public. The Evil Progenitor had once fought in the battle to annihilate the god race all those years ago.

“How can you count me out?” Suddenly, another voice resounded, and then a black shadow appeared here.

The Devil Monarch’s expression changed at the sight of him, and he hurriedly stood up, “Ancestor?”

It was the Devil Progenitor.

Yang Ye had met the Devil Progenitor in the past, but it had been in the lower universe.

Another progenitor!

Four progenitors and Shao Siyou’s main body was equivalent to five progenitors!

Such a force could be considered as the strongest in the large universe!

The Weapon Progenitor closed his eyes slowly, “Then let’s begin!”

At the main peak of the Slaughter Line in the Weapon Dimension.

An old man was sweeping.

It was Elder Yuan whom Yang Ye had interacted quite a bit with. Zhong Ye was standing nearby.

Zhong Ye looked up at the sky and said, “It’s starting!”

Elder Yuan replied indifferently, “Yes.”

Zhong Ye asked, “What do you think about it?”

Elder Yuan put down the broom in his grasp and looked up at the sky, “The large universe will perish!”

Zhong Ye’s pupils constricted, “Senior Heaven Secret, you…”

The old man was the founder of Heaven Secret Hall who had vanished for a long time.

Senior Heaven Secret!

…

The God Battlefield.

In the hall within the underground city.

Zhi’er sat at the seat of the host, and Ding Shaoyao was by her side.

Even though she was the patriarch of the god race now, Ding Shaoyao was dealing with most things in the god race. It was Zhi’er who wanted her to do it. Because the strategist’s position was merely inferior to the patriarch in the god race!

There were 25 figures below them. The ten on the left wore luxurious white robes, and the ten on the right wore black robes. As for those at the center, those five were middle aged men in violet armor!

The Evil Yin Sprite was by Zhi’er and Ding Shaoyao’s side!

The Royal Crocodile was lying on the ground outside the hall!

All the experts of the god race were gathered here!

The hall was extremely silent, and a long time passed before Ding Shaoyao opened her eyes, “The Sprite Lord!”

Zhi’er lowered her head slightly. She knew that Ding Shaoyao had made her choice.

Ding Shaoyao looked forward emotionlessly in silence.

…

The prehistoric ruins.

The casket had shattered, and a figure was floating above it.

Just like that, the hall remained extremely quiet for a long time. Suddenly, a voice resounded, “Chaos has arrived! My Lord, please prepare yourself!”

The hall fell silent once the figure finished speaking.

…

Initial Spirit Star.

On the platform deep within the city, the sacrificial altar suddenly started trembling.

Some time passed before a voice filled with madness resounded, “Haha! Spirit energy has collapsed! It has collapsed! After countless years, it has finally collapsed! Haha!”

Along with that insane voice, the entire ruins of the city was covered in a barrier of light, and then the barrier gradually dimmed down.

It dimmed down because spirit energy was gradually vanishing.

Time flashed by quickly, and the three month period was over.

In the depths of a bamboo forest in the lower universe, an armless man was staring blankly at a painting on the wall in a bamboo house.

It was a painting of Yang Ye’s mother.

A long time passed before he suddenly walked closer to it, “Yu’er, in my entire lifetime, I, Yang Wudi, never let down the heavens or the earth, but I let both of you down. Ye’er has grown up, and he can take care of himself. As for you… Don’t worry, I’ll come accompany you soon!”

He walked out of the bamboo house once he finished speaking.

Outside the bamboo house.

There were five progenitors!

The Weapon Progenitor, Buddhist Progenitor, Devil Progenitor, Shao Siyou’s main body, and the Evil Progenitor!
