Chapter 1853 – I’ve Been Waiting For You!

As soon as the umbrella shattered, the black clothed man had moved 30m away and created distance between himself and Yang Ye.

The black clothed man spoke solemnly, “You’re Yang Ye!”

Yang Ye wasn’t surprised by this. As soon as he used his sword, he knew he wouldn’t be able to conceal his identity. Besides that, the battle he just experienced had allowed him to realize that just his physical strength was utterly insufficient to kill a Quasi Enlightened Realm expert!

His current physical strength was only capable of fighting a Quasi Enlightened Realm expert!

Yang Ye was about to attack again when the space before him trembled, and then a voice resounded in his mind, “Run!”

It was Dark’s voice!

Run? Yang Ye frowned. Suddenly, Dark’s voice resounded again, “Now!”

Yang Ye didn’t hesitate a moment longer. He glanced at the black clothed man and vanished towards the distance.

“You think it’s that easy to flee now?” The black clothed man grunted coldly, and then he immediately chased after Yang Ye.

Yang Ye was a treasure right now! If he could kill Yang Ye, he would obtain the wooden sword, and the wooden sword was a divine treasure! Even if he couldn’t kill Yang Ye, he just had to keep Yang Ye busy, and he would get an Imperial Rank treasure!

At this moment, the black clothed man was extremely excited!

It didn’t take long for Yang Ye to arrive in the starry sky. In the beginning, he didn’t really understand why Dark had asked him to run. But once he left the planet, he understood everything. Countless powerful auras were enveloping down towards the dead planet.

Yang Ye’s face fell at the sight of this.

So many people wanted to kill him!

Suddenly, he turned to look behind him, and he saw a ray of black light shooting in his direction.

It was the black clothed man!

Yang Ye didn’t stop, nor did he dare to stop. He immediately shot up into the sky.

This time, he didn’t use his sword because it would make him an obvious target!

However, he’d underestimated the black clothed man’s speed. Even though he’d raised his speed to the limits of his body, the black clothed man was following closely behind him!

No more than three breaths of time after Yang Ye and the black clothed man left the planet, countless powerful auras suddenly appeared there.

Two breaths of time later, these auras left like a receding tide, and then they shot towards the depths of space. If Yang Ye was here, he would notice that they were going in the direction he’d left towards.

In the boundless reaches of space, Yang Ye shot forward like a shooting star, and a black ray of light was following closely behind him.

Yang Ye turned to glance at the black ray of light, and his gaze was icy cold. If it was just the black clothed man, he would have stopped and fought. However, if he stopped to fight the black clothed man now, he would definitely be surrounded by countless experts!

He couldn’t stop and fight!

At least not now!

He had to shake off the black clothed man and hide himself. He had to hide in the shadows. So, he sped up as soon as he thought up to this point.

Yang Ye’s expression gradually became unsightly.

Because another aura had surpassed the black clothed man, and that aura was rapidly closing the distance between them! Based on that person’s speed, it would take less than ten minutes for that person to catch up!

Suddenly, a black spear that was 3km long flashed out from the space before Yang Ye, and the powerful energy it carried made Yang Ye slow down by at least three times.

A vicious expression flashed through Yang Ye’s eyes as the wooden sword appeared in his right grasp. A moment later, a ray of light flashed out, and then it stabbed against the tip of the spear.

Bang!

As soon as they collided, they shook violently, and then the huge black spear was blasted away. However, it didn’t take long for it to vanish into space. Meanwhile, the aura behind Yang Ye had gotten much closer!

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings, and then he looked into the distance before vanishing on the spot.

Bang!

Yang Ye descended to the ground.

At this moment, he was on a dead planet. He looked up as soon as he descended to the ground. The aura above was getting closer and closer, and it would take no more than 20 breaths of time to arrive before him.

Yang Ye tightened his grip on the wooden sword while his profound energy started to surge madly. At the same moment, the ground and space around him trembled, but it only took a moment for the space and ground to return to normal.

Yang Ye stared in the direction of the aura, and his grasp on his sword grew tighter and tighter.

Three breaths of time later, a small black dot appeared within his field of vision, and it didn’t take long to rapidly grow larger in size. A breath of time later, it was at least 100 times larger than before.

The spear from before appeared within Yang Ye’s field of vision again. But this time, there was a middle aged man behind it. The middle aged man wore a violet gold robe, and there was a scarlet red dot on the center of his forehead. It made him seem slightly attractive.

When the spear arrived around 300m away from him, Yang Ye’s right leg finally moved.

Boom!

The ground in an area of over 300km around Yang Ye collapsed and was obliterated in an instant. At the same time, a speck of cold light appeared at the tip of the spear.

Two powerful attacks colliding against each other!

As soon as they collided…

Boom!

A terrifying wave of energy erupted from the point of collision. Everywhere it passed, space was obliterated, and a huge area in the surroundings was turned pitch black!

Yang Ye and the middle aged man vanished on the spot at the exact same instant that the wave of energy erupted out. The middle aged man was blasted back into outer space while Yang Ye was blasted into the ground.

Once his figure was slammed into the ground, Yang Ye didn’t shoot back up towards the middle aged man, and he relied on the force from the collision to go deeper into the ground.

The middle aged man stood up there in outer space, and a normal sized black spear was by his side. He glanced at the tip of the spear. There were cracks on it.

He fell silent for a short while, and then he suddenly looked down at the dead planet. A moment later, he grabbed the black spear, and then a powerful aura swept out from him. Meanwhile, the spear started to tremble as if it had come alive.

A breath of time later, he flung the spear towards the planet below him, “Soul Seeker!”

The spear shot down like a meteor, and it instantly entered the dead planet.

Boom!

The spear struck the ground, causing a loud explosion to resound while a mushroom cloud instantly appeared above the planet. Meanwhile, as soon as the spear struck the ground, an area of over 300km around the spear collapsed into bits. Moreover, the radius was still expanding.

Meanwhile, the spear had shot into the ground and was chasing after Yang Ye. Everywhere it passed, everything around it collapsed. Moreover, its speed and strength didn’t weaken, and it was even growing stronger and faster!

In the depths of the ground, Yang Ye, who’d relaxed slightly, suddenly had a grim expression on his face. Because an extremely powerful aura had enveloped him, and it was locked onto him and approaching rapidly!

He didn’t give up! Yang Ye’s heart sank.

Meanwhile, Hou Qing’s voice resounded in Yang Ye’s mind, “Kid, his strength isn’t ordinary. You’re in trouble!”

Yang Ye nodded. The middle aged man’s strength really did surpass his imagination! Moreover, he couldn’t turn back and fight the man. Because those people who were chasing him were definitely almost here.

Flee!

The only thing he could do now was flee with everything he had. He had to create distance between himself and them, and then go into hiding! Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Meanwhile, the middle aged man closed his eyes and didn’t do anything.

Suddenly, numerous powerful auras appeared around him, and then a black clothed man appeared not too far behind him.

The black clothed man was the same black clothed man who’d fought Yang Ye just now.

The black clothed man glanced at the middle aged man and was about to speak. However, the middle aged man suddenly opened his eyes, and then he transformed into a ray of light that vanished on the spot.

At the same time, deep below the ground. A speck of black light suddenly appeared behind the spear that was chasing after Yang Ye, and then a man appeared behind it. The man was the same middle aged man who’d been high above in outer space just now!

He’d traveled the distance in an instant!

In the starry sky.

After the middle aged man left, the surroundings fell silent. Some time passed before a voice suddenly resounded, “Was that the Soul Seeker, Xiao Hanyi?”

“So it was him… Xiao Hanyi, the man who’s about to become an Emperor!”

A moment of silence ensued, and then those auras shot down in pursuit.

They still refused to give up!

Deep below the ground. The spear was in hot pursuit of Yang Ye. Yang Ye didn’t stop and just shot down like a madman. It didn’t take long for him to pass through a world of lava, and it allowed Yang Ye to be aware that he was about to pierce through to the other side of the planet.

He continued speeding up!

Around six hours later, Yang Ye finally emerged from beneath the ground and arrived in space again.

As soon as he appeared there, he intended to speed up again. However, a voice suddenly resounded in his ears, “I’ve been waiting for you.”

Yang Ye’s heart sank when he heard it.
