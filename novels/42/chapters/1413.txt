Chapter 1414 – What The Hell Is That?

The reason the Demon Lord had launched this sudden attack against Zhuang Weiran was because of the situation Celestial Demon Stellar Region was in. Its forces were completely suppressed, and it would take an hour at most for them to be completely defeated. At that time, it would be pointless even if he could kill Yang Ye and the others.

A stellar region couldn’t have just one Deity.

So, he’d decisively chosen to launch a surprise attack on Zhuang Weiran. So long as he could kill her, the violet robed old man could help Celestial Demon Stellar Region’s army or help him instead.

At that time, the situation would be turned around.

As for why he didn’t target Yang Ye, it was because he wasn’t confident that he could kill Yang Ye with a single blow.

Yang Ye was too mysterious and definitely had some sort of trump card. So, for safety’s sake, he’d chosen to kill her first. Moreover, Zhuang Weiran was locked in battle with the violet robed old man, so she would definitely be unable to defend herself against him, and he would have a very good chance to kill her.

Yang Ye’s face instantly became savage when he saw the Demon Lord launch a surprise attack against Zhuang Weiran. However, his gaze seemed quite calm. He didn’t hesitate to charge at the Demon Lord.

The Demon Lord was extremely swift and instantly arrived near Zhuang Weiran. But right when he was about to attack, Zhuang Weiran suddenly abandoned the violet robed old man, and then she clenched tightly onto Peacekeeper as she turned around and stabbed it at the Demon Lord.

Bang!

A ray of white light sprayed out of Peacekeeper and instantly arrived before the Demon Lord, so the Demon Lord was taken by surprise and was struck by it before he could even attack.

Bang!

An explosion resounded as the Demon Lord was blasted over 1km away, and he hadn’t even stopped his figure before Yang Ye had arrived behind him. Yang Ye swiftly swung Heaven’s Gravestone at the Demon Lord and blasted him back.

Meanwhile, the violet robed old man would naturally not let the opportunity slip by. He was about to attack when Qiong Qi suddenly appeared in front of him. The old man was shocked by the sight of Qiong Qi. After all, he’d witnessed how terrifying Qiong Qi was, and he immediately decided to avoid Qiong Qi. However, Qiong Qi didn’t give him the chance and immediately transformed into a ray of black light that collided with the old man.

Bang!

The old man was blasted over 10km away. Qiong Qi naturally didn’t give up the opportunity to continue striking the old man without any mercy, and he immediately pounced forward and slammed his figure against the old man again.

Bang!

The violet robed old man was blasted away once more, and he spat out numerous mouthfuls of blood in midair. When he saw Qiong Qi charging at him again, the old man hadn’t hesitated to turn around and tear space open, and then he leaped into the spatial rift he’d created. In an instant, his aura had vanished completely.

He’d fled!

Actually, he’d wanted to flee a while ago. He hadn’t fled in the beginning because he knew the Celestial Demon Lord still had a trump card. So, once the Demon Lord utilized that trump card and he helped the Demon Lord annihilate Yang Ye and the others, then he and his stellar region would definitely obtain tremendous benefits. Moreover, he and his stellar region would gain the shares of those fellows who’d fled earlier.

But after fighting for a while, he noticed that the Demon Lord wasn’t able to do anything to Yang Ye’s group even after the Demon Lord utilized his trump card.

At this moment, the violet robed old man had wanted to flee. However, he was a little reluctant to give up until the Demon Lord’s surprise attack on Zhuang Weiran failed. The last shred of hope within him had vanished then, so he had no intention to fight Qiong Qi and fled immediately.

Qiong Qi didn’t chase the old man, he just turned around and charged at the Demon Lord.

Bang!

Meanwhile, a circle of lightning suddenly erupted from the Demon Lord, and it blasted Yang Ye, Zhuang Weiran, and Qiong Qi back.

“You knew that I would launch a surprise attack!” The Demon Lord stared fixedly at Zhuang Weiran. It was obvious from how she’d attacked him that she knew he was going to launch a surprise attack against her. He really couldn’t figure out how she knew.

A cold smile curled up on the corners of Yang Ye’s mouth, “Of course she knew!”

Actually, while Qiong Qi and him fought the Demon Lord earlier, he’d expected that the Demon Lord would launch a surprise attack on Zhuang Weiran. Why? Because the Demon Lord couldn’t pierce through Qiong Qi and his defenses, but Zhuang Weiran didn’t possess such defenses. So, it was very likely for the Demon Lord to target her first.

After all, he’d frequently utilized similar tactics!

For safety’s sake, he’d warned Zhuang Weiran. So, even though she was in battle with the violet robed old man, her attention was always on the Demon Lord. Thus, she didn’t seem to panic when the Demon Lord suddenly attacked her, and she even took him by surprise.

Zhuang Weiran didn’t answer the Demon Lord. She just glanced at Yang Ye and said, “Be careful!”

As soon as she finished speaking, her figure flashed and shot towards the experts of Celestial Demon Stellar Region. The Demon Lord’s defenses were absolutely impenetrable, so she wouldn’t be able to harm him even if she stayed. Moreover, she might be a burden to Yang Ye and Qiong Qi. Because her defenses weren’t as strong as theirs, so the Demon Lord would definitely target her.

So, she’d decisively chosen to help the forces of Clouds of Heaven Stellar Region.

Now that Zhuang Weiran had joined the battle, it was like adding fuel to the flame that was burning the forces of Celestial Demon Stellar Region. It didn’t even take long for them to lose another Deity.

Meanwhile, the Demon Lord stared fixedly at Yang Ye, and the violet threads that had vanished from his hands earlier had appeared there once more. Once they appeared on his hands, the Demon Lord’s face warped. A moment later, his figure vanished on the spot, and he was already before Yang Ye and Qiong Qi when his figure appeared once more. After that, he swiftly slapped down his palms at Yang Ye and Qiong Qi!

Bang!

A black energy palm that carried violet threads flashed out from his palms, and it instantly arrived in the air above Yang Ye and Qiong Qi before descending upon them.

Yang Ye didn’t dare act carelessly. He immediately sat on Qiong Qi’s back, and the Heaven’s Gravestone within the ancient sheath was exchanged for the Sword Precursor.

Qiong Qi immediately leaped up under Yang Ye’s orders, and he shot towards the energy palm. Once they arrived before it, Yang Ye swiftly drew his sword and swung it.

Bang!

Yang Ye’s sword struck the energy palm, and it shook violently while countless cracks instantly appeared on it. However, the black energy palm didn’t shatter. Conversely, Yang Ye and Qiong Qi were pushed around 3km back. Moreover, the black energy palm didn’t slow down at all and continued down towards Yang Ye and Qiong Qi.

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly, and then a wisp of ruthlessness flashed through his eyes. A moment later, both he and Qiong Qi vanished on the spot.

Bang!

Another explosion resounded, and then the black palm shattered while Yang Ye and Qiong Qi were blasted away again. Both Yang Ye and Qiong Qi’s expressions changed drastically while their figures were blasted away. Because once the black palm shattered, the violet threads had actually not vanished and were shooting towards them.

Cosmic rays!

Seriousness filled Yang Ye’s eyes. He hadn’t expected that Qiong Qi, a true Heavenrend, and him wouldn’t be able to destroy those cosmic rays.

Their strength had exceeded his expectations a little!

Yang Ye didn’t dare act carelessly, not did he dare to hold back!

The Sword God’s Seal suddenly glowed brilliantly on Yang Ye’s forehead, and it didn’t take long for his sword intent to rise madly.

Bang!

A wave of sword intent suddenly appeared around Yang Ye, and then the space in his vicinity instantly started to ripple.

Quasi Returnal Rank sword intent!

Meanwhile, the cosmic rays had arrived in front of Yang Ye.

Yang Ye sheathed his sword, and then swiftly drew it and swung it again!

Once it was enhanced by Quasi Returnal Rank sword intent and slaughter intent, how terrifying was Yang Ye’s Heavenrend now?

Bang!

The cosmic rays in front of Yang Ye were slashed into bits. However, Yang Ye didn’t stop once they were slashed into bits. He sheathed his sword once more, and then Qiong Qi leaped forward under his command and shot towards the Demon Lord.

A wisp of disbelief flashed through the Demon Lord’s eyes when he saw the cosmic rays being slashed into bits. He hadn’t expected that Yang Ye’s sword intent would actually attain the Quasi Returnal Rank at this moment!

Two Quasi Returnal Rank intents!Is he trying to defy the heavens?

The Demon Lord didn’t have the time to linger on this. Because Yang Ye had arrived in front of him. A wisp of viciousness flashed through his eyes as his body suddenly started to tremble violently. After that, countless pillars of black lightning surged out from within him. It only took an instant for the entire sky to be covered in pillars of lightning, and they’d even enveloped Yang Ye and Qiong Qi within them!

“Slash!” Suddenly, Yang Ye’s furious shout resounded from within the lightning, and then an ear piercing sword howl resounded through the continent.

The ocean of lightning shook violently, and then a brilliant beam of sword energy flashed through it.

Two overlapped Heavenrends!

Yang Ye hadn’t held back at all. He’d used all the profound energy and remaining stellar energy within him to execute two overlapped Heavenrends!

Bang!

Everywhere it passed, it destroyed everything in its path and sliced open the ocean of lightning.

Bang!

The Demon Lord was blasted away, and his figure flew for over 30km.

The experts from Celestial Demon Stellar Region turned ghastly pale at the sight of this. Because they hadn’t just seen the Demon Lord being blasted away, they’d even seen his Celestial Demon Hegemon Body vanishing.

Has he lost?Has the Demon Lord lost?

Suddenly, Qiong Qi emerged from the ocean of lightning while carrying Yang Ye on his back. Why was he said to be carrying Yang Ye? Because Yang Ye was lying flat on Qiong Qi’s back.

That attack had really reached his limit!

Fortunately, he had the Stellar Ward technique to support him, so he didn’t fall unconscious.

Yang Ye looked up towards the Demon Lord, and then he didn’t hesitate to pat Qiong Qi. Qiong Qi understood what he meant and charged at the Demon Lord.

Actually, that attack the Demon Lord executed had been his last attack as well. He’d released all the black demonic lightning within him, so his hegemon body technique had vanished as well. However, his stronger attack had lost against Yang Ye’s strongest attack. So, not only had his technique vanished, he had even suffered heavy injuries.

Yang Ye would naturally not let this opportunity slip by.

Right when Yang Ye and Qiong Qi arrived around 300m away from the Demon Lord.

“How presumptuous!” Suddenly, the Demon Lord looked up at Yang Ye and Qiong Qi. But at this moment, his expression was quite strange. After that, an ethereal figure appeared above him.

The figure was completely pitch black and ethereal, and there was a pitch black character at the center of its brows — ‘魔’

Once the ethereal figure appeared, a terrifying aura suddenly appeared here, and it was even stronger than the Demon Lord’s aura. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“What the hell is that?” asked Qiong Qi.

Yang Ye replied, “Who cares what the hell it is! Let’s kill it first!”
