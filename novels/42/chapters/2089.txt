Chapter 2090 – The Void Dimension!

How does he know it’s the Sky Dragon? Yang Ye’s heart was filled with questions.

Meanwhile, the black robed man suddenly appeared not too far before Yang Ye. He stared at Yang Ye and asked, “Why? Why is it with you?”

Yang Ye glanced at the black robed man. He could see that the man’s eyes were still staring at him, and it sent a slight chill down his spine.

Yang Ye didn’t attack since the black robed man didn’t attack, and he said, “I obtained it while I was in the Sky Dimension!”

The black robed man asked, “Was it the Sky Emperor?”

Yang Ye nodded. At this moment, he had a rough guess about which race the black robed man was from.

The black robed man frowned, “Why did he give it to a human?”

Yang Ye shrugged, “I don’t know. However, he didn’t give it to me for free. He wanted me to help the sky race when it’s in need!”

The black robed man gazed at Yang Ye for a long time before he asked, “Then why has the Sovereign of Sky constantly tried to kill you?”

Yang Ye shrugged, “I was once friends with his daughter. He doesn’t want there to be any link between me and his daughter, so he aroused the desire to kill me. Unfortunately, he hasn’t succeeded.”

The black robed man closed his eyes.

He was hesitating!

Hesitating on whether he should attack Yang Ye!

The Sky Dragon was the symbol of the sky race’s guardian. As for the Sky Emperor, he was a person that the black robed man had extremely great respect for. All those years ago, it had been the Sky Emperor who’d led the sky race to becoming independent, and it was the Sky Emperor who got the sky race a place in the large universe.

It could be said that the Sky Emperor was someone the entire sky race respected!

The Sky Emperor was an extraordinary expert too, and he’d given Yang Ye the Sky Dragon…

As soon as he thought up to this point, he gazed at Yang Ye. At this moment, he suddenly realized that Yang Ye was a rare genius. Both Yang Ye’s potential and strength were absolutely outstanding. In the future, once Yang Ye attained the Sage Realm, then besides the progenitors who practically never showed themselves in the outside world, no one else would be able to do anything to Yang Ye. Moreover, Yang Ye had the Dao Path’s support too…

Once he thought up to here, the black robed man had made his decision. He spoke in a low voice, “I’m a Sage of the sky race. Since you’re the guardian chosen by the Sky Emperor, I naturally can’t act against you. However, I can’t help you for the sake of the sky race’s safety. Good luck!”

He turned around and left once he finished speaking.

“Why?” Suddenly, Yang Ye asked, “Just because I’m the sky race’s guardian?”

The black robed man stopped and replied, “Since the Sky Emperor chose you, he definitely has his reasons. I’m doing this because of him, and not because I want you to do anything for the sky race in the future. Of course, if you can remember the kindness he has shown you, that’s naturally for the best; but it’s fine if you don’t.”

He vanished into the sky once he finished speaking.

Meanwhile, the black robed man’s voice resounded, “The Sage Alliance won’t stop!”

That was all he said.

Yang Ye fell silent on the spot. He hadn’t expected this to happen. The black robed man had actually chosen to stop fighting. Of course, it was a good thing for him. Because while he could fight the black robed man, he didn’t have a very good chance to win. He could only be considered to have a chance. Since the black robed man was willing to stop, it was naturally for the best.

Yang Ye put Elysium away and entered the Primordial Pagoda,

Recuperate!

His entire body was injured from the battle.

Under the effects of the Primordial Violet Energy, it took less than two hours for his injuries to be completely healed, and then Yang Ye went to Snowy. Snowy was still evolving.

Not being able to play with the mischievous little fellow for so long felt quite strange to Yang Y.

Meanwhile, Tian Xiu came to Yang Ye, “Big Brother, when will Snowy wake up?”

Yang Ye took Tian Xiu in his arms and smiled, “Soon. Do you miss her?”

Tian Xiu nodded, “Very much!”

Yang Ye smiled, “Me too. However, we can’t disturb her. Let her play with you after she completes her evolution, alright?”

Tian Xiu nodded, and then she tilted her head to the side and gazed at Yang Ye, “Big Brother, no matter what happens to me in the future, I won’t forget you and Snowy.”

Yang Ye gazed at her and spoke seriously, “Tian Xiu, why do you say that?”

She lowered her head and remained silent.

Yang Ye asked softly, “What’s wrong?”

She replied, “I-I don’t know. I-I just have a very bad feeling. I-I don’t want to lose both of you, I won’t lose both of you!”

Yang Ye rubbed her head gently, “You won’t. So long as you don’t leave us, then we will never leave you.”

While he did say that, Yang Ye’s heart sank. Tian Xiu was no ordinary little girl, so he took the change in her emotions very seriously. He didn’t know what would happen to her in the future. If she became a good person, that would be good; but if she became a bad person… It would be quite troublesome to deal with. That was what Yang Ye was worried about!

After playing with Tian Xiu for a while, Yang Ye left the pagoda.

As soon as he emerged from the pagoda, he received a message from Yang Lianshuang.

Yang Ye withdrew the transmission stone, and Yang Lianshuang’s voice came from it, “Something huge has occurred!”

“Something huge?” Yang Ye frowned because her voice was very solemn.

Meanwhile, her voice resounded again, “The Bodhi Tree of legend has appeared.”

“The Bodhi Tree?” Yang Ye asked, “What do you mean?”

She explained, “It’s a divine treasure. According to rumor, the progenitor of the Buddhist Path relied on it to attain the Dao and become a progenitor. Simply speaking, it’s very likely to be able to help a Sage take that final step out of the Sage Realm and become a progenitor. Since the Buddhist Progenitor used it all those years ago, it vanished, and everyone thought it was in the Buddhist Path’s possession. However, it had a spirit of its own, and it hadn’t chosen to go with the Buddhist Progenitor. It left on its own.”

Yang Ye asked, “How do you know?”

Yang Lianshuang said, “I learned about it from my research. However, I don’t know if it’s true. But the Bodhi Tree has shown itself. It’s in the Void Dimension. The Void Dimension is an independent world in the large universe, and it’s the first world to be found outside the large universe. Only endless black holes are beyond it. Perhaps only progenitors are able to find out what’s at the end of those black holes.”

Yang Ye spoke in a low voice, “Is the information reliable?”

“90%!” Yang Lianshuang continued, “I’ve looked through other pieces of information, and the Bodhi Tree does appear from time to time. Of course, I dare not guarantee that it is the Bodhi Tree. However, I suggest you go take a look. But don’t fight for it because if it’s the real Bodhi Tree, then the Sages of all the races and many other Sages will fight with their lives to obtain it. At that time, even if you can get it, it won’t be yours.”

Yang Ye asked, “Then why are you asking me to go there?”

“Fool!” Yang Lianshuang spoke slightly loudly, “You don’t have to obtain it, but perhaps you’ll be able to advance in your cultivation if you see it. In short, it’s an opportunity, so you have to try. Moreover, based on your strength, you should be safe so long as you don’t fight for it.”

Yang Ye fell silent. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Meanwhile, Yang Lianshuang added, “It’s a good opportunity. It’s good even if you’re able to just take a glance at it. If your luck is good, and you obtain a Bodhi Fruit or even a Bodhi Leaf, it’s still a huge gain. However, you must be careful because if I’m not wrong, all the races, the four paths, and some other mysterious organizations have probably heard of this too. So, there should be a huge number of experts rushing to the Void Dimension right now.”

Yang Lianshuang paused for a moment and continued, “Actually, if I’m to be honest, I really hope that you can get it, and you have a very, very good chance. After all, you have that treasure and Snowy. Isn’t Snowy very skilled at deceiving others?”

Snowy suddenly sneezed in the Primordial Pagoda.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye spoke in a low voice, “Can it really help someone become a progenitor?”

Yang Lianshuang replied, “Perhaps it’s a little exaggerated, but its effects are definitely prominent too. Even if it can’t help you become a progenitor, you will definitely benefit tremendously from it. Otherwise, all those powers wouldn’t be tempted by it. So, what do you think?”

Yang Ye spoke solemnly, “What will happen to me if I get it?”

She replied, “You’ll definitely be pursued by all the races and countless other experts. In any case, you have to be brave to get anything, and the cowardly get nothing! Moreover, I refuse to believe that existence in the Dao Path really doesn’t care about you at all. Perhaps he’s not doing anything now in order to temper you, but if he still doesn’t help you at that time, then there’s no point for you to stay in the Dao Path. It’s better to go to the other paths instead!”

Yang Ye thought for a long time, and then he withdrew the Bodhi Leaf he had.

Yang Ye felt that this Bodhi Leaf was probably from that Bodhi Tree. Just a single leaf could conceal his aura and make Sages unable to find him, so what about the whole tree?

Yang Ye thought for a long time, and then he said, “Alright, I’ll go have a look. I’ll take it if I can, and if I can’t, I’ll still get a few leaves. That’s still worth it!”

Yang Lianshuang said, “Be careful. I’ll continue gathering information about all the races at all times, and then I’ll select the useful pieces of information and send them to you. Besides that, the god race may take action, so be careful. They’re mysterious and powerful. While they’re still in hiding now, I believe it won’t be long before they make all the races tremble before them!”

The god race!

Yang Ye laughed bitterly. The god race had merely shown the tip of the iceberg that was the god race, but just that tip had instilled extreme fear into the sky race!

Yang Ye spoke with Yang Lianshuang for a while longer, and then he put the transmission stone away and vanished into the sky.

To the Void Dimension!
