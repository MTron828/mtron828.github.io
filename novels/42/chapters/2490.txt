Chapter 2491 – Completely Bare!

An Inner Court Disciple!

Just like that, Yang Ye was an Inner Court Disciple of the Ancient Sword Sect. The treatment received by inner court disciples was much, much better than outer court disciples. They didn’t just receive classes from Lord Realm experts every month, they were given 100 Eternal Immortal Crystals! Besides that, there were many other benefits.

However, they had many missions too.

There weren’t many inner court disciples, less than 50 in fact. As for elite disciples, there were even fewer. Perhaps there were only around 10 of them!

Elite disciples were the true core of the Ancient Sword Sect because they were the central pillars of the sect. Thus, the sect gave these elite disciples abundant resources.

Simply speaking, elite disciples could enter the Ancient Sword Cave, and it was there that Sword Scroll’s main body’s fragments resided!

Now, it was clearly impossible for him to directly seek to become an elite disciple. It would be too insane, and it would draw the attention of the sect’s higher-ups.

He had to keep a low profile!

He had to take it slow!

In his room, Yang Ye sat cross-legged and Sword Scroll spoke abruptly, “You can take a look at the Sword Cliff!”

“The Sword Cliff?” Yang Ye asked, “What’s that?”

Sword Scroll replied, “It’s where the founder of the Ancient Sword Sect perished. He was a figure of the ancient times, someone from the same generation as Wu Ni and the others.”

Yang Ye asked, “What’s over there?”

She fell silent for a short while and replied, “I’m not sure. But you can try your luck there. Moreover, his sword intent and will in the Sword Dao still remain there, and they may be of help to you.”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and nodded.

If it was someone from the same generation as Wu Ni, he would definitely not be ordinary. Moreover, he was a sword cultivator, so there was definitely something to learn from him!

Yang Ye thought for a moment, and then he left for the Sword Cliff.

Because of how unique the Sword Cliff was, the Ancient Sword Sect didn’t prohibit any disciples from going there. All the disciples could observe and comprehend the will in the Sword Dao and sword intent their founding ancestor had left behind. Of course, it was only open to inner court disciples and elite disciples.

It was one of the benefits they received!

Once he arrived at the Sword Cliff, Yang Ye saw some people there. Some were in deep thought before the cliff, some were seated cross-legged as if they were in comprehension, and some had started to practice with their swords.

It was quite bustling!

Sword Scroll suddenly said, “Go over, a strand of the founding ancestor’s sword intent is there!”

Yang Ye nodded and walked over. There was a man and a woman already there. Both of them were very young and around his age. The man wore a violet robe with a sword chest on his back. He was seated cross-legged there with his eyes closed, seeming to be in deep thought

The woman, on the other hand, wore an ink green dress with landscape embroidered on it. She was pretty, not gorgeous, but had quite an elegant aura!

As if she’d sensed his arrival, the woman suddenly glanced at Yang Ye. Yang Ye nodded slightly as a form of greeting, but she immediately moved her gaze away.

Yang Ye didn’t mind because the people of this world weren’t very friendly at most times. In any case, it didn’t bother him!

Yang Ye’s gaze descended onto the cliff wall, and it was smooth as a mirror. Yang Ye didn’t notice anything on it, so he pondered deeply for a moment and closed his eyes.

It didn’t take long for Yang Ye to sense a strand of sword intent!

Sword intent!

it wasn’t strong. After all, even the strongest sword intent would be corroded by time. Yang Ye was visibly moved because of something that it contained instead!

Will!

Yang Ye sensed the will of the Ancient Sword Sect’s founding ancestor through his sword intent!

Unyielding!

An unyielding will. He’d seen something like it in the past, but they were completely different. The unyielding will in this sword intent was toward the world, the heavens, all things, and destiny itself.

A very, very long time ago. When humans had just appeared on the earth, humans were innately weaker when compared to other races like the demon race. The humans were enslaved during that time.

The human race’s current status had been obtained with the sacrifice of countless.

Just like the human race’s method of cultivation. If the ancestors of the past hadn’t invented them, the human race would have probably vanished from history by now. As for those who had been able to survive those times, they were absolutely not ordinary.

Unyielding!

The people of that era had an unyielding spirit. Actually, if he thought about it, Wu Ni, Martial Ancestor, and Chen Xuanan had the same will!

Unyielding, no matter what!

It was a form of belief in the Sword Dao!

Actually, the Ancient Sword Sect’s founding ancestor had a rather similar Sword Dao with Yang Ye. They were generally alike, but there were some differences.

Belief in the Sword Dao!

Yang Ye suddenly thought of something. Since An Nanjing could merge her beliefs in the Martial Dao into her spear, why couldn’t he do the same with the sword?

Belief!

At most times, belief was extremely important, and it may become a person’s source of strength, like Belief Energy.

The founding ancestor of the Ancient Sword Sect didn’t possess an unyielding sword intent, it was that he’d added his own beliefs into his sword intent!

That was Yang Ye’s understanding of it all, and his analysis received Sword Scroll’s acknowledgment!

Suddenly, a voice interrupted Yang Ye’s thought, “You’re Ye Yang?”

Yang Ye turned around and noticed that it was the woman who’d spoken those words.

Yang Ye nodded.

She spoke indifferently, “I heard you just joined the outer court, and then you quickly became an inner court disciple.”

Yang Ye smiled, “That isn’t illegal, right?”

She glanced at him, “You’re very arrogant!”

Yang Ye shook his head, “You’re wrong. I just don’t conform to the expectations of many and some rules. So, you think I’m arrogant.”

She gazed at him for a long time and said, “There’s this mission, want to do it together?”

“A mission?” Yang Ye shook his head, “I’m not interested!”

She replied, “Don’t you want to become an elite disciple?”

Yang Ye smiled, “Don’t lie to me. I have to be at the Four World Realm at least to become an elite disciple, and I need to be capable of fighting Five World Realm experts. There’s a strict requirement toward age too.”

She shook her head, “That’s in the past. Now, we have an opportunity!”Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Yang Ye replied, “Huh?”

She spoke indifferently, “Have you heard of the War Dimension?”

The War Dimension!

Yang Ye nodded, “I know a little!”

She said, “The desolate race will go to war with Eternal Kingdom, sooner or later. At that time, we’ll be summoned to fight. Now, the War Dimension seems to need more people, and it’s open to the outside now. Want to give it a try?”

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and asked, “The requirements to enter the War Dimension aren't any lower than the requirements to become an elite disciple, right?”

She shook her head, “Its requirements are quite low now. Or to be more precise, they are looking to recruit a secondary team, or you can call us the replacement team. So long as we get into the War Dimension, the sect may allow us to become elite disciples in advance. Because the various powers have an agreement that states all elite disciples are protected. In other words, old geezers cannot act against the core disciples of the various powers. If we enter the War Dimension, it’s very likely that the sect makes us elite disciples. Because those who survive the War Dimension are much stronger than the elite disciples of the various powers!”

The War Dimension!

Yang Ye naturally knew about it. It was where the Eternal Kingdom specially fostered experts to fight the desolate race!

And Yang Ye really wanted to go have a look!

Yang Ye gazed at her, “Why are you asking me to join you?”

She replied indifferently, “You’re not the only one. Many other inner court disciples will be giving it a try. Or I should say that anyone with some strength will be trying. If we’re able to get in, at least we can take care of each other. There’s always conflict where there are people, and it’s a hundred times crueler than the world outside!”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and replied, “Are you sure we can become elite disciples by joining the War Dimension?”

She shook her head, “I dare not say for sure.”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and replied, “Alright, let’s give it a try.”

“One month!” She continued, “We’ll teleport over in a month from now. Prepare well during this month. Right, I’m Mo Ya.”

Mo Ya!

Yang Ye nodded, “See you in a month!”

Yang Ye turned around and left.

He wanted to head back and give belief a lot of thought.

Once Yang Ye left, the man suddenly opened his eyes, “Demoness Mo, why have you taken a liking to him?”

She replied indifferently, “Can’t I?”

He replied, “Let me give you a warning. He’s not ordinary, so it’s best if you don’t target him. Otherwise, you’ll die before you know it!”

“Oh?” She was suddenly quite interested, “Xue Yiren, why don’t you tell me why he isn’t ordinary?”

The man, Xue Yiren, stood up slowly, “That’s all I have to say. It’s your problem whether you believe it or not.”

He turned around and left.

Mo Ya grinned, “I wouldn’t ask him if he was ordinary! A powerful body refiner. I haven’t seen one in a very, very long time!”

Yang Ye returned to his room, sat down cross-legged, and entered the Primordial Pagoda.

Sword Scroll went over to him and said, “She seems to possess the Inner Charm Physique, it’s similar to Zhixian’s physique!”

Yang Ye was slightly stunned, and then he smiled, “What does that have to do with me?”

Sword Scroll replied indifferently, “Body refiners and those with special physiques are her favorite. Because they are full of vitality and carry special effects. If I’m not wrong, she is targeting you. Of course, it may be because she wants to absorb everything you have.”

The Inner Charm Physique!

Yang Ye seemed to have thought of something, “It’s just like Zhixian’s physique?”

Sword Scroll nodded.

“Oooh!” At this moment, Yang Ye thought of something.

A completely smooth body!
