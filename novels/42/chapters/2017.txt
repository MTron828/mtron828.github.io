Chapter 2018 – Traitor of the Human Race!

Bang! Bang! Bang!

Yang Ye held one of the young man’s legs and slammed him incessantly against the ground, causing the ground to crack open incessantly. Countless rocks and blood sprayed into the surroundings, and it was an absolutely horrible sight.

At this moment, many people from the devil race had gathered here.

“Stop!” Suddenly, a furious shout resounded from afar.

However, Yang Ye showed no signs of stopping, and he still continued slamming the young man against the ground. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“How dare you!” Another furious shout resounded, and then a figure shot at Yang Ye.

Suddenly, Yang Ye stopped, and then he turned around and swung a punch.

Bang!

An explosion resounded, and the figure was blasted back.

It was an armored man who’d attacked Yang Ye. The man was around the age of 30 and had a robust figure. Yang Ye looked like a child before him.

The man glanced at his fist. It had cracked open, and his bones were visible.

The armored man looked up at Yang Ye while a wisp of solemness appeared in his eyes, “Who are you?”

Yang Ye kicked the young man to the side and asked, “What?”

“He’s from the sky race!” Suddenly, the young man, who was on the verge of death, spoke abruptly.

The sky race!

Everyone from the devil race gazed at Yang Ye when they heard him, and they had hostile gazes in their eyes. As for the armored man, his gaze turned icy cold, and he was about to attack.

Suddenly, Yang Ye appeared in front of the young man, and he lifted up the young man before the others could even react, “Do you know why I’ve beaten you up? It’s because you’re aware that I’m not from the sky race, yet you still insisted on looking for trouble with me.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye slapped the young man.

Slap!

A loud slap resounded, and the young man was slapped flying. He flew for over 1km before he slammed against the ground.

After he slapped the young man flying, Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings and said, “I’m a human!”

A human!

Everyone here was quite stunned. Meanwhile, Yang Ye stopped concealing his aura. As soon as they sensed his aura, the expressions of many people from the devil race eased up quite a bit. As far as they were concerned, they weren’t here to help the young man from the devil race, they were here because they refused to let someone from the sky race make a show of strength here!

But Yang Ye wasn’t from the sky race!

So, many started to leave. Yang Ye didn’t attack again, and he walked off as well.

Yang Ye wasn’t here to cause trouble, but if anyone came looking for trouble with him, then he wouldn’t hold back. If he had to kill, he would kill; if he had to bash them up, he would bash them up!

Yang Ye hadn’t gone far when a young man suddenly appeared in front of him, “You’re a human? I’m human too. I’m Liao Fan, nice to meet you!”

Yang Ye sized up the man before him, and there was slight surprise in his eyes. It was because the man was a See Dao Realm expert!

A See Dao Realm expert!

The man was below 30 years of age, but he was already a See Dao Realm expert. So, the young man’s natural talent was quite monstrous!

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts and replied, “Ye Yang!”

He naturally planned to avoid using his real name. He wasn’t afraid of using it, but he knew that it would draw a lot of trouble to him.

Liao Fan smiled, “Brother Ye, if I’m not wrong, you should be here for the Sage Ruins, right?”

Yang Ye nodded, “You too, right?”

Lian Fan smiled, “Looks like we have a common goal. Right, I have two other friends as well. I wonder if you’re willing to join us?”

Yang Ye was about to refuse when Liao Fan added, “Brother Ye, you probably don’t know much about the Sage Ruins, right?”

Yang Ye nodded, “I really don’t know much. Why?”

Lian Fan replied, “It’s situated at Horizon Mountain, and it’s at the border between the Devil Dimension and the Oceanic Dimension. It’s called Horizon Mountain because the oceanic race is on the other side.”

Yang Ye asked, “What are you trying to say?”

Liao Fan smiled, “Brother Ye, it isn’t that easy to enter the Sage Ruins. There are three dangers we must face. Firstly, the experts of the devil race and oceanic race over there. Because of the Sage Ruins, those fellows have started killing to accumulate wealth. It can be said that many die before they even reach Horizon Mountain!”

He paused for a moment and continued, “The second danger is at the foot of the mountain. There are a few types of mysterious forces there, and they once killed Zen Realm experts. As for the third danger, it’s naturally all these other fellows from all the races. Even if we obtain the inheritance, leaving safely is a huge problem! So, it’s necessary to find some companions, right?”

Yang Ye hesitated on the spot, and then he nodded, “Alright!” He didn’t know much about Horizon Mountain, so traveling with Liao Fan’s group was perfect to make up for that. Horizon Mountain was where the Sage Ruins was, and it was definitely not a normal place!

Liao Fan grinned when he saw Yang Ye agree, “Please come with me!”

Yang Ye followed Liao Fan out of Boulder City, and they met a man and woman on a small hill outside the city. The man wore a violet robe and held a spear; the woman wore a cloud white dress and had a sword hanging by her waist.

The man was handsome, and she was beautiful!

The violet robed man gazed at Yang Ye and said, “What’s this?”

Liao Fan smiled, “This is Brother Ye Yang. I met him in Boulder City.” He gazed at Yang Ye and pointed at the man and woman, “This is Brother Su Xiu from the human race as well, and she’s Miss A’Xiu from the human race too.”

Su Xiu and A’Xiu sized up Yang Ye, and then they nodded as their way to greet Yang Ye.

Yang Ye nodded to them too, and then he gazed at Liao Fan, “Are we going now?”

Liao Fan nodded, “Of course. I don’t want to waste time!”

They left the hill and walked to Horizon Mountain. Horizon Mountain was less than four hours away from them, and if they flew, it would take less than 10 minutes. However, they didn’t choose to fly because they would be huge targets for everyone!

Suddenly, Liao Fan asked, “Do you think Yang Ye will come?”

Yang Ye was stunned when he heard this.

Su Xiu said, “He should. Sage Ruins are a huge, fortuitous encounter for cultivators like us. So, I think he won’t let it slip by!”

Suddenly, A’Xiu said, “I hope he does!”

Yang Ye gazed at her, “Why?”

A’Xiu glanced at Yang Ye and didn’t say a word.

Meanwhile, Liao Fan chuckled, “Brother Ye, perhaps you’re not aware that Yang Ye is said to be the number one genius in the large universe. Of course, no one acknowledges that. At the very least, no one in our circles acknowledges it. After all, he hasn’t fought in the Martial Emperor Rankings. Of course, perhaps he really may be the number one sword cultivator.”

He gazed at A’Xiu and continued, “A’Xiu is a formidable sword cultivator, so she naturally wants to meet Yang Ye and see if he’s really as strong as the rumors say!”

Yang Ye nodded slightly and asked, “Right, what’s the Martial Emperor Rankings?”

Liao Fan glanced at Yang Ye and spoke with astonishment, “You haven’t heard of it?”

Yang Ye nodded, “I haven’t!”

Liao Fan glanced at Yang Ye with a weird expression in his eyes, and he said, “The Martial Emperor Rankings is a joint ranking in all the races of the large universe. The experts on the rankings are the top geniuses in all the races. Especially the top 10, they are extremely terrifying. That fellow who was once ranked at the 9th ranking killed a genius from one of the four top clans, and not only did that genius’ clan not seek vengeance from him, they even extended an olive branch to him.”

Yang Ye asked, “Are the geniuses of the top clans stronger than the geniuses of all the races?”

“You can’t say that!” Liao Fan continued, “In overall, their quality is slightly better. However, it doesn’t represent that the geniuses of all the races are inferior to them. Just like those monstrous geniuses in the top 10 of the Martial Emperor Rankings. They aren’t inferior to the geniuses of the four top clans!”

Yang Ye nodded slightly and didn’t say anything. Meanwhile, Liao Fan said, “Since Yang Ye could trample on all the geniuses of the sky race, he’s clearly not a weakling. Based on his strength, he should be able to enter the top 10. Of course, it’ll be an entirely different story if it was just exaggerated.”

Su Xiu suddenly asked, “So what? He’s still a traitor of our human race. I really don’t understand. Based on his natural talent, he can become a pillar of our human race, so why did he have to collude with the shaman race?”

“He colluded with the shaman race?” Yang Ye gazed at Su Xiu, “Did the Sovereign of Man say that?”

Su Xiu nodded slightly, “The Sovereign of Man issued a warrant. Yang Ye is a traitor of the human race now, and no one is allowed to protect him.”

Yang Ye didn’t say anything else. He realized that he couldn’t return to the Human Dimension. Otherwise, endless trouble would be surging towards him once he returned. Moreover, the Sovereign of Man refused to give up until he was dead!

Meanwhile, Liao Fan suddenly gazed at Yang Ye, “Which clan are you from?”

Su Xiu and A’Xiu gazed at Yang Ye too.

Yang Ye smiled, “A small clan you’ve probably never heard of.”

Liao Fan and the others glanced at Yang Ye and didn’t say anything. Because asking again would be insensible!

Two hours later!

Suddenly, Liao Fan said, “We’re here!”

They stopped and looked ahead.

Suddenly, Yang Ye’s expression changed, and he immersed his consciousness into his body. A moment later, Yang Ye’s astounded voice came from within the Primordial Pagoda, “What?”
