Chapter 2753 – Old Friend!

A discussion started in the hall.

Their topic was how to manage the Three Dimensional Universe!

Yang Ye had given them a rough direction, but they had to discuss the details before deciding on implementing them.

Actually, none of the experts or powers here were against Yang Ye’s suggestion.

Because his suggestion was extremely beneficial to them.

In the past, they had been managing their own worlds alone, but along with this suggestion of Yang Ye’s, they may become the managers of the entire Three Dimensional Universe.

The managers of the Three Dimensional Universe!

No one could avoid being tempted by that!

However, the discussion was extremely intense because there were many branches of thoughts and conflicting ideas.

Fortunately, they were only discussing it and showed no signs of fighting.

Obviously, they had started to gradually acknowledge each other.

Yang Ye left the hall, and Jian Wudi was by his side.

They walked off into the distance.

A short while later, Jian Wudi spoke softly, “Your suggestion is possible, but you must not overlook something. Those within the hall may become the worst tumor of the Three Dimensional Universe!”

Yang Ye nodded, “I know!”

Power!

He was very well aware that if they annihilated the End World and had no other enemies, then those fellows in the hall were very likely to become the greatest issue of the Three Dimensional Universe.

Selfish motivations and desire.

Everyone had them, and it was easy to get lost in absolute power!

Jiang Wudi nodded slightly, “Since you’re aware, then I’m sure you have a plan, right?”

Yang Ye nodded, “I do. However, I cannot realize it right now. There are things which can’t be rushed. Otherwise, the losses will outweigh the benefits.”

Jian Wudi glanced at Yang Ye with a complicated expression in his eyes, “The world thinks you’re an impulsive fool, but you’re absolutely smart in reality!”

Yang Ye shook his head and chuckled, and then he looked up at the sky. Actually, he wasn’t good at managing the world at all. However, he didn’t have to do it. He just had to create order, and then the people of the world could manage themselves.

Order was a form of restraint!

He was trying to restrain everyone in the Three Dimensional Universe.

If many things in the world could be done more fairly, the world would be a much better place!

Once Yang Ye and Jian Wudi finished speaking, he was about to enter the Primordial Pagoda when the transmission stone suddenly trembled.

Yang Ye withdrew it, and a voice came from it, “It’s like that mysterious expert and the others just vanished into thin air. There’s no information on them at all.”

Yang Ye’s face turned gloomy.

The mysterious expert was a latent problem for him!

Meanwhile, the voice resounded once more, “Shall we meet?”

Meet!

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts and nodded, “Alright, where are you?” He was very curious about this mysterious person he’d been communicating with.

The voice replied, “Behind you!”𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Yang Ye turned around, and the space there cracked open. A moment later, a black robed figure walked out of there.

The black robed figure walked over to him and slowly removed the black robe. A short while later, a familiar face appeared before Yang Ye.

Yang Ye was stunned!

It was none other than Ding Shaoyao who’d been missing for a long time!

This woman he’d been entangled with on many occasions in the past!

He had naturally not forgotten her.

Ding Shaoyao smiled, “Are you surprised?”

Yang Ye recovered from his shock and nodded.

She spoke softly, “I thought it would be a pleasant surprise!”

Yang Ye chuckled, “Of course I’m pleasantly surprised.”

She glanced at him and grinned, “It makes me very happy to hear that.”

Yang Ye asked, “The power that backs you…?”

She replied, “It was once a part of the End World, but they left due to some conflict, and then they established their own organization. They took a liking to my ability and recruited me.”

Yang Ye spoke softly, “They were willing to work with me because of you, right?”

Ding Shaoyao nodded, “Yes. They were against it in the beginning, but as you grew stronger, they stopped. Moreover, my status grew as well.”

Yang Ye smiled, “Congratulations!”

Ding Shaoyao and him walked side by side.

She said, “Are you serious about the new order you spoke about earlier?”

Yang Ye nodded.

Ding Shaoyao spoke softly, “How about letting me help?”

Yang Ye smiled, “Did you think you could escape?”

Ding Shaoyao’s ability in this respect was absolutely unmatched!

Her management skills were the best Yang Ye had ever seen!

She spoke softly, “You know… If our world had all of this, it wouldn’t have been destroyed. A world’s lifespan is actually very long, but it’s based upon the fact that no one harms it. Once people start harming it, and especially when the strong start doing as they please, a world cannot endure them.”

She gazed at Yang Ye and continued, “However, it’ll be very difficult to implement the order you envision. You must be mentally prepared.”

Yang Ye smiled, “It’ll definitely be difficult in the beginning. But it’s fine, we can take it slow.”

He was quite confident about it. Because he had practically all the Destiny Realm experts of the Three Dimensional Universe!

Absolute strength would crush all who resisted!

Ding Shaoyao nodded, “I’m going to make detailed plans and consider how to implement them!”

Yang Ye smiled, “That’s great!”

He’d had quite a headache about this, and now that he had Ding Shaoyao’s help, it was undoubtedly perfect for him.

After chatting with Ding Shaoyao for a while, Yang Ye returned to the Primordial Pagoda.

In the Primordial Pagoda.

Yang Ye went to the Ascension Platform, and Snowy appeared before him. She hid her paws behind her back and seemed to be hiding something. Of course, her tiny figure couldn’t hide anything.

Yang Ye could see what she was hiding behind her back!

A sword! Burial!

Meanwhile, Snowy cracked a smile and passed Burial to Yang Ye like she was displaying a treasure to him!

At this moment, Snowy had cleared away Burial’s original sprite, and it was a brand new sword. It had a sprite that Snowy made herself.

It was a brand new Burial!

Yang Ye didn’t look at it and just rubbed her head gently, “Good work, little fellow.”

Snowy smiled. She couldn’t fight, and she could only help Yang Ye and the others in this way. Moreover, she seemed to understand that those people out there seemed to be targeting her.

This little fellow had actually started to understand things!

Yang Ye rubbed her head again and gazed at Burial!

A sword without a hilt!

Heaven Executor hadn’t had a complete blade in the past, yet now, this sword felt like it had a blade without limits!

It was a sword made specially to counter the swords of Destiny!

Yang Ye grabbed Burial. It didn’t reject him. After all, it wasn’t the same sword anymore!

Yang Ye shook his head and smiled as he gazed at it. It was a very, very formidable sword. Unfortunately, even the most formidable sword couldn’t replace the Sword Precursor’s place in his heart!

It wasn’t an Ordinary Sword yet, but Yang Ye knew that the Sword Precursor would reach that height one day!

As if it sensed what he was thinking, the Sword Precursor by his waist trembled slightly and let out a sword howl.

Yang Ye glanced at it, chuckled, and then passed Burial back to Snowy. The sword was still lacking, and Snowy had to forge it a little more.

As for Burial, he naturally planned to use it. However, he refused to rely on it. The sword didn’t belong to him and wasn’t suited to his Sword Dao! Of course, he would still use it nevertheless.

Snowy took Burial and started enhancing its sword sprite.

Yang Ye grinned as he watched Snowy get busy, and then he went over to an empty area. He tapped his right foot against the ground and said, “Brother Divine Vein, please come out here for a moment!”

The ground before him cracked open, and a dragon head appeared.

Yang Ye smiled, “I have something to discuss with you.”

The divine vein asked, “You want me to head outside and restore the spirit energy there?”

Yang Ye nodded.

The divine vein looked down at Yang Ye, “Can you keep me safe?”

Yang Ye nodded, “I cannot guarantee your absolute safety, but anyone who wants to harm you will have to get through me.”

The divine vein gazed at Yang Ye for a long time. In the end, it nodded, “That promise is enough for me!”

The divine vein suddenly shot up into the air!

A moment later, countless people saw a huge, pure white dragon appear in the sky above Paradise City.

The divine vein!

Presently, besides Paradise City, everywhere else in Eternal Kingdom had practically no spirit energy. Moreover, now that the spirit energy was gone, the herbs and other living beings throughout the world had started to slowly wither, and they could be said to be filled with a deathly air!

Along with the appearance of the divine vein, the spirit energy throughout Eternal Kingdom started to gradually recover.

Everything was alive again!

The entire Eternal Kingdom was filled with cheers!

Previously, they hadn’t considered spirit energy to be that precious. However, during this time they lost the divine vein, they suddenly realized how important spirit energy was!

It was a common thing for most people. People never treasure what they possess, and they only realize how important it was after they lost it.

Yang Ye stood high above as he gazed at the world below in silence.

After everything that happened, he was certain that the people of Eternal Kingdom would learn to cherish what they had!

Meanwhile, Ding Shaoyao and the others appeared near Yang Ye.

Yang Ye gazed at them and asked, “You’ve finished the discussions?”

Ding Shaoyao nodded, “We have a rough plan and policy. But there’s some difference in opinion between us.”

Yang Ye gazed at her, “What is it?”

Ding Shaoyao said, “It’s about Eternal Kingdom and whether people from outside should be restricted from coming here. If we do that, it would be no different than what the previous Eternal Kingdom did. But if we don’t and allow more and more to come here, this place won’t be able to endure such a burden.

Once she finished speaking, everyone here gazed at Yang Ye.

To restrict them or not to restrict them?

Yang Ye pondered deeply for a moment and said, “Restrict them. However, we must add another rule, and that is a restriction on the people of Eternal Kingdom!”
