Chapter 1740 - No Shrinking Back!

There was a woman lying in the coffin. However, it was none other than the woman in a red dress who was standing beside Yang Ye!

Yang Ye turned to look at her, and she spoke indifferently, “Are you very surprised?”

Yang Ye replied, “Didn’t you say that the old man in Daoist’s robes sealed your father?”

She spoke indifferently, “It was a lie!”

The corners of Yang Ye’s mouth twitched slightly, A lie…

Meanwhile, Ku Zhuyi suddenly pointed at the woman in the coffin and asked, “Then who is she?”

The woman in a red dress gazed at the woman in the coffin and replied, “Me!”

As she spoke, she suddenly leaped up and transformed into a ray of red light that entered the body of the woman in the coffin.

A moment later, the woman in the coffin opened her eyes, and then her figure floated up slowly. She glanced at the surroundings and took a deep breath, “I’m finally free.”

Yang Ye forced a smile and said, “Congratulations!”

The woman suddenly gazed at him when she heard him, and then her gaze descended onto his abdomen.

Yang Ye slowly clenched his left hand when he noticed her gaze on his abdomen.

A long moment of silence ensued before the woman suddenly said, “You’re a genius, so stay by my side!”

Yang Ye shook his head, “Sorry, I like my freedom!”

She looked him in the eyes, “You’re refusing me?”

Yang Ye nodded, “I don’t like to be tied down. So, I can’t stay with you.”

Suddenly, the woman appeared in front of Yang Ye and said, “I don’t like others refusing me! No one has ever refused me either! Because everyone who tried is dead.”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and replied, “Something forced never lasts. Don’t you think so too?”

She shook her head, “So long as I like it, nothing else matters.”

Yang Ye looked her in the eyes, “Both I don’t!”

Suddenly, she placed her right hand on Yang Ye’s right hand, “I can sense that your hand is filled with boundless energy. If I’m not wrong, it’s your final trump card, right?”

Yang Ye nodded, “Sort of!”

The Wargod’s Arm!

Based on his current strength, if he unsealed his right arm and used the wooden sword, then even he couldn’t imagine how strong he would be.

Meanwhile, she suddenly lifted his right sleeve and placed her hand on the golden seal. After that, she looked Yang Ye in the eyes, “Want to give it a try?”

Yang Ye gazed at her for a long time before he said, “So be it!”

How could he shrink back at a time like this?

He couldn’t!

He didn’t know how strong she was, but he was sure of one thing, and it was that she was extremely strong. However, he couldn’t shrink back no matter how strong she was. Being no match for her and not even fighting her were two completely different things! Even if he was no match for her, he dared to fight her!

She nodded slightly and was about to pull off the talisman. However, Snowy suddenly appeared before Yang Ye while holding the wooden sword, and then a dense expanse of sword energy enveloped the woman.

However, it only took a moment for the sword energy to vanish into thin air.

Meanwhile, the woman’s gaze descended onto Snowy and the wooden sword.

Snowy blinked, glanced at the woman in a red dress, and then gazed at Yang Ye. She blinked, and then cracked a smile before taking the wooden sword with her as she entered Yang Ye’s body.

She’d fled!

Yang Ye laughed bitterly. Even Snowy is fighting if she can and fleeing if she can’t!

Yang Ye shook his head, gazed at the woman, and said, “Since you want to fight, then let’s fight.” Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

As he spoke, he was about to pull off the talisman on his arm. However, she suddenly said, “What’s that wooden sword doing in your possession?!”

Yang Ye gazed at her, “You recognize it?”

She replied with a question, “You don’t?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “I don’t!”

The woman took a deep and long glance at Yang Ye, fell silent for a long time, and then suddenly turned around, “Leave!”

Yang Ye was stunned, “You’re not going to attack me anymore?”

She flipped her hand gently, “A day from now, the formation around Moment Mountain will be destroyed. At that time, anyone left in Moment Mountain will die. Of course, everyone in Moment Mountain right now will die too.”

Yang Ye asked, “You’re going to leave?”

“Leave?” She turned to look at Yang Ye, “For what?”

Yang Ye said, “I thought you wanted to reign supreme over the medium universe!”

“Reign supreme over the medium universe?” A wisp of disdain appeared on the corners of her mouth, “What’s the point of that? This is just a cage that those ancient cultivators left behind. My objective is the large universe that is high above in the nine heavens.”

The large universe! Ku Zhuyi heaved a sigh of relief when she heard the woman. If the woman wanted to reign supreme over the medium universe, then she would be a calamity for the entire medium universe. The woman’s strength was simply unfathomable, and she had the corpses throughout Moment Mountain!

It could be said that no clan could stop her!

“Above the nine heavens?” Yang Ye said, “You want to go to the large universe?”

She glanced at Yang Ye, “You’ll be going there too.”

As soon as she finished speaking, she turned around and said, “Go on. I want some time to myself!”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and said, “Even though we haven’t known each other for long, I have to warn you. Those cultivators outside think that the inheritance and treasures of a powerful expert is hidden in Moment Mountain. They will definitely not stop trying to explore this place. So…”

“Then let them come!” She continued, “These corpses haven’t tasted fresh blood for a long time!”

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and said, “Er, since we’ve gotten to know each other, do you have anything that you don’t want? Like the Blood Armor and Sword Chest. If you do, then give them to me. I will never complain about getting too many!”

The corners of Ku Zhuyi’s mouth twitched.

Meanwhile, the woman suddenly turned to look at Yang Ye, and then she slowly clenched her fist. At the same time, Yang Ye suddenly wrapped his left arm around Ku Zhuyi’s waist, and then he vanished on the spot.

The woman was slightly stunned, and then she shook her head.

Meanwhile, a voice resounded, “Master, why didn’t you kill him and take that divine treasure within him?!”

She looked in the direction Yang Ye had left towards, and a long time passed before she said, “There are too many uncertainties tied to him. Even though I’ll be able to obtain that treasure by killing him, the potential troubles are endless. But I don’t want too much karma to be bound to me for now.”

“Understood!” The voice continued, “Master, now that you’re free, what should we do next?”

The woman closed her eyes slowly, “Wait! Wait until my strength recovers completely!”

…

Yang Ye and Ku Zhuyi didn’t stay in the well, nor did they dare to. The woman was an ancient cultivator. She’d been living for countless years, and her strength was absolutely not something he could rival.

Yang Ye and Ku Zhuyi didn’t leave Moment Mountain. They found an old and run down hall to rest in temporarily. Because there was still a day until the formation around Moment Mountain was destroyed. As for how it would be destroyed, it was obvious that the woman would do it.

In any case, he just wanted to wait quietly until the formation was destroyed, and then leave this damnable place.

He was satisfied with his gains throughout this trip!

As for what the woman’s objective was or what she was thinking, it had nothing to do with him!

He just wanted to improve his strength and have a good fight with the Yang Clan!

Yang Ye sat cross-legged on the ground and issued a command in his heart. The Sword Chest appeared in front of him, and then he stretched out his hand and flicked it. The Sword Chest shook violently, and then six black swords appeared before him.

As soon as they appeared before him, Yang Ye noticed that they were actually linked to his mind. In other words, he could control them with his thoughts. Simply speaking, they were equivalent to six additional hands!

With his current strength, it was entirely possible for him to split his attention onto multiple things!

However, he still had to train in order to use the swords like they were his arms!

Now was definitely not the time to do that.

Suddenly, Yang Ye frowned, and then he winked at Ku Zhuyi. The latter was puzzled when Yang Ye suddenly cursed, “Dammit! That treasure above the True Rank is guarded by three Rotting Corpses within the well!”

When he spoke up to this point, he withdrew two Energy Pearls and passed them to Ku Zhuyi, “Quickly consume them. Once we’ve recovered, we’ll head down there again. I refuse to believe that we can’t wear them down until they die!”

Ku Zhuyi glanced at Yang Ye. She was about to speak when cold laughter suddenly resounded, “A treasure above the True Rank? Tsk, tsk. I never expected to hear of such a pleasant surprise!”

As soon as the voice finished resounding, over a dozen people suddenly appeared not too far away from Yang Ye and Ku Zhuyi. The person who led the group was none other than Ying Mu!

“You…” Yang Ye suddenly pulled Ku Zhuyi along with him as he moved backwards repeatedly, and his voice was filled with shock, “What are you doing here?!”

“What are we doing here?” There was a wisp of ferocity on Ying Mu’s face, “We fled here of course! You didn’t let us enter the city, so we were almost eaten alive by those corpses.”

Yang Ye continued pulling Ku Zhuyi backwards, “What… what do you want?” His voice was shaking, and he seemed like he was extremely afraid.

“What do I want?” Ying Mu’s face grew more and more ferocious.

Meanwhile, one of the men beside Ying Mu spoke abruptly, “We can’t fight here. There are many Rotting Corpses and Soul Corpses here. If we fight here, it’ll draw the attention of those monsters. There are those human experts hiding in the city as well. Let’s go get the treasure at the bottom of the well first.”

“The treasure?” Suddenly, Yang Ye cried out loudly, “There’s no treasure! There really isn’t any treasure!”

The man by Ying Mu’s side spoke flatly, “We heard everything you said just now.”

Yang Ye became visibly anxious and hurriedly said, “There really is no treasure down there. It’s very dangerous. You must not go down there!”

Ying Mu stared at Yang Ye and Ku Zhuyi, and then he said, “I’ll deal with both of you once we get that treasure!”

Yang Ye spoke angrily, “You idiots! There really is no treasure down there! I’m not lying to you! I can swear on it!”

Ying Mu glanced coldly at Yang Ye, “We would really be idiots if we believed you!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Ying Mu and the others vanished on the spot.
