Chapter 2253 – You Should be Honored that I Came for You!

The Sword Sect, the Unfettered One!

The Unfettered One’s voice was very calm and flat.

Xiao Lou nodded slightly and asked, “Why are you here?”

The Unfettered One gazed at Xiao Lou, “Few in this world are worthy of fighting me. You’re one of them, so I came.”

Xiao Lou suddenly started laughing.

The Unfettered One asked, “Is it very funny?”

Xiao Lou chuckled, “How many years has it been? It’s the first time someone has said that to me. A long time ago, I used to say the same to others. But I never expected to be treated the same way today.

He waved his right hand slightly, “All of you step back.”

All of them moved aside.

Once they’d gone far enough, Xiao Lou gazed at the Unfettered One, “My instinct tells me that you’re very strong. Come! Let me see how strong you are.”

The Unfettered One shook his head slightly, “You attack first.”

Xiao Lou’s eyes narrowed slightly, “Why?”

The Unfettered One replied, “If I attack, there won’t be another round.”

“Haha!” Xiao Lou suddenly started roaring with laughter, and it reverberated like a thunderclap through the area.

He laughed for a while before he gazed at the Unfettered One, “I was born in the undying race and conquered countless universes. The experts I’ve met are simply uncountable, and I’ve even almost been killed in the past. All of them had a commonality, they were arrogant, extremely arrogant. Of course, I’m arrogant too. You have the right to it when you’re strong. However, you’re the most arrogant I’ve ever met.”

Suddenly, the Unfettered One raised his right hand and waved it lightly.

A ray of sword energy flashed.

The ray of sword energy was just around an inch in length, and it wasn’t fast at all. At the very least, it didn’t look fast to the people here.

However, Xiao Lou’s expression had instantly changed. He clenched his right fist tightly and slammed it forward.

Bang!

The space in a huge area shook violently.

The might of his punch could shake the world!

Because he didn’t want to damage the undying race’s territory, he’d condensed all his energy and sent it against the sword energy via space. However, his space was too strong, and it was so strong that just a little bit of its remaining strength was sufficient to shake the surroundings!

Meanwhile, the ray of sword energy arrived.

Hiss!

The sword energy sliced through Xiao Lou’s attack and shot through his body.

A wisp of blood sprayed from his chest.

The surroundings fell silent.

Deathly silent!

All the experts of the undying race had disbelief in their eyes!

Xiao Lou had been injured!

The experts of the undying race were filled with shock and disbelief!

The Unfettered One walked slowly in Xiao Lou’s direction, “I was just speaking of a fact, yet you said I’m arrogant. Since you said that, I’ll be arrogant this one time.” He stopped and gazed at Xiao Lou, “You should be honored that I came for you. Understand?”

Xiao Lou should be honored!

Absolutely arrogant!

The expressions of all the experts from the undying race turned extremely unsightly.

That wasn’t just arrogance, it was disdain. Disdain toward Xiao Lou and the undying race.

Xiao Lou’s face turned gloomy too. After all, when had he ever been treated like this?

Suddenly, the Unfettered One tapped his finger at Xiao Lou from afar.

A sword howl resounded.

Xiao Lou’s eyes narrowed slightly while a cold glow flashed within them. After that, he took a step forward, and the world shook before him.

Xiao Lou closed his eyes after taking that step.

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!

An instant later, horrifying sounds resounded through the surroundings. If one looked carefully, one would notice that the Unfettered One’s sword energy was being corroded by a mysterious force.

At the same time, the space around the Unfettered One was being corroded too. Actually, it wasn’t just the space there, even the Unfettered One himself had actually started to be corroded!

The Unfettered One glanced at his body and nodded slightly, “Death energy… No, it has surpassed the scope of death energy. Interesting.”

He chuckled once he finished speaking, and then he drew his sword from his waist and swung it.

He sheathed his sword, and then walked away!

A ray of sword energy sliced through space behind him.

Hiss!

The entire space throughout the world turned ethereal, and it instantly obliterated the mysterious energy Xiao Lou emanated.

Hiss!

It arrived before him and instantly shot through Xiao Lou’s chest.

Xiao Lou’s figure stiffened on the spot.

The experts of the undying race were astounded, and they charged toward Xiao Lou. However, Xiao Lou shook his head slightly and slowly sat down cross-legged before placing his right palm against his chest.

Bang!

A strand of death energy erupted from within him!

A remnant of the Unfettered One’s sword energy was raging through his body!

The only way for him to avoid death was to eliminate the sword energy. Otherwise, it would fully destroy his undying body.

Pure death energy surged endlessly into him. Just like that, with the help of that endless supply of death energy, the remnant of the Unfettered One’s sword energy slowly vanished in the end. At this moment, Xiao Lou heaved a sigh of relief like a burden had been lifted from his shoulders.

A short while passed before he looked up at the direction the Unfettered One had left toward, “How strong!”

How strong!

It was spoken with sincerity.

A single attack.

The Unfettered One had almost killed him with just one attack!

Even though he knew that was no casual attack, it still couldn’t hide how terrifying the Unfettered One was. However, Xiao Lou did feel relieved too. He was relieved that the Unfettered One wasn’t targeting the undying race. Because that would be a huge calamity to the undying race. It would be just like the Void Spirit Maiden whom they’d encountered all those years ago. Moreover, the Unfettered One may be an even greater calamity!

A long time passed before Xiao Lou restrained his thoughts and gazed at Master Yuan and the others, “Put the matter of Void Spirit Continent aside for now. We’ll wait for the patriarch!”

He’d planned to deal with Void Spirit Continent as soon as he emerged from the Undead Tower, so that the undying race could rest at ease as it traveled to the initial race’s territory. Yet now, he’d changed his mind. It wasn’t that he was afraid, but he felt that they should be a little cautious.

The undying race couldn’t allow too much of their forces to be exhausted!

…

Void Spirit Continent.

Void Spirit Hall, in the Primordial Pagoda.

Yang Ye had been cultivating, but Yang Lianshuang suddenly appeared before him.

Yang Ye gazed at her, and the latter pondered deeply for a moment before she said, “Once this is all over, I want to return to my hometown!”

Yang Ye asked, “Your hometown?”

Yang Lianshuang nodded, “I haven’t been home for a long time. I wonder how it is now.”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and nodded, “Alright!”

Yang Lianshuang smiled, “I may need your help when the time comes. It’s not a problem, right?”

Yang Ye replied, “Of course!”

She nodded, “Then I’ll trouble you then. I have many things to deal with, so I won’t disturb you!”

She left the Primordial Pagoda once she finished speaking.

In the pagoda.

Yang Ye fell silent for a long time, and then he left the pagoda and went to see Nether Maiden and the others. However, he didn’t show himself and just watched them from the shadows. Since they came to pay their respects to Shao Siyou that day, they started cultivating. During this period of time with Tian Xiu’s guidance, their strength had advanced by leaps and bounds. While it was impossible for them to attain the Progenitor Realm, their combat strength had improved tremendously!

Yang Ye watched for a long time, and then he went to a different room. A robust woman was seated cross-legged there, and it was A’Man!

She was cultivating!

While the barbaric race had been practically annihilated, he’d brought all of A’Man’s loved ones to Void Spirit City. Besides that, Qin Chuan and the others’ loved ones had been brought to Void Spirit City too.

In Void Spirit City, there were Yang Ye’s loved ones like Su Qingshi, Xiao Yuxi, Zhuang Weiran, Xue’er… There were A’Man’s loved ones, Qin Chuan’s loved ones, Yu Jing’s loved ones, Mad Saber’s loved ones, Ling’s loved ones…

There were Yang Ye’s friends like Nether Maiden and the others, and Elder Yuan.

Yang Ye shook his head and smiled.

Without him realizing it, the burden he carried was growing heavier! However, it was something he should do!

But the pressure he had to endure against the undying race was quite heavy!

Yang Ye left and went to the sky above the city. He gazed in the direction of the endless black holes. The home of the undying race was in that direction.

Meanwhile, An Nanjing appeared beside him.

Yang Ye gazed at her and said, “The pressure is tremendous!”

The undying race’s strength far surpassed his imagination. So, if he was being honest, he was prepared to die.

Death! Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

There was no other way.

An Nanjing gazed at Yang Ye for a long time. Suddenly, she took his hand, “We’ll face it together!”

Together!

Yang Ye gazed at her and suddenly started smiling, “Someone once said that with my character, I would be all alone. However, I’m not all alone. Getting to know all of you makes my life worth it.”

An Nanjing looked up into the distance, and she spoke softly, “If I only had the Martial Dao, my life would be so boring!”

Yang Ye tightened his grip on An Nanjing’s hand and spoke softly, “I’ve asked Elder Yuan to investigate. The undying race plans to activate the formation in this large universe. Once it’s done, it will instantly exhaust all the spirit energy in the large universe, including the undying race’s spirit energy. So, the universe will truly become filled with death then, and even if the people of the large universe survive, they will grow old and die rapidly from the lack of spirit energy.”

An Nanjing asked, “You plan to stop them?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “They can’t be stopped. Moreover, even if the undying race doesn’t activate that formation, the large universe doesn’t have much time left. The undying race has almost completely destroyed this large universe!”

He took a deep breath at this point and said, “I can die, Qingshi and the others can die too, but I can’t allow Nether Maiden and her sisters or A’Man and the others’ families to die. Even if I and my wives die, they must not. I can’t allow my friends to die for me, and then allow their families to die too.”

An Nanjing spoke solemnly, “What do you plan to do?”

Yang Ye closed his eyes slowly, “I haven’t gone berserk in a long time. It’s time to do so again.”

Suddenly, a middle aged man appeared near Yang Ye.

He stood there with a sword in hand.

It was the Unfettered One.

The Unfettered One gazed at Yang Ye, “There are some things I should put an end to before I leave. Give me a reason not to kill you!”
