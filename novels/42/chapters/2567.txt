Chapter 2568

The useful remains!

Xing Biqing fell silent for a long time and said, “He is very talented, is he not?”

The middle aged man shook his head, “I would be willing to wait at any other time, but we don’t have much time left anymore.”

Xing Biqing glanced at him and said, “Uncle, I don’t want to be the clan’s patriarch anymore.”

The middle aged man turned around to look at her, “Because of him?”

She nodded, “He is my friend, and I’m a member of the Xing Clan. I don’t want to choose between him and the clan in the future.”

The middle aged man shook his head, “You’re not very mature!” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Xing Biqing smiled, “Perhaps. I just want to focus on my cultivation now.”

The middle aged man nodded, “I respect your decision.”

Xing Biqing bowed slightly to him and left.

The middle aged man continued planting his vegetables.

…

The Ye Clan.

Ye Zhibei was the patriarch of the Ye Clan now, but her authority wasn’t that great.

Strength always decided things, and authority was given proportionately to strength.

Ye Zhibei went to the rear mountains of the Ye Estate, and she met the Ye Clan’s ancestor there.

The Ye Clan’s ancestor was the true master of the Ye Clan.

Ye Zhibei walked over to him, and the latter said, “Sit.”

She didn’t sit and remained standing instead.

The Ye Clan’s ancestor smiled, “You’re here for Ye Yang?”

She nodded.

He said, “Go on!”

Ye Zhibei fell silent for a short while and said, “I know that the Ye Clan would never get itself swept into such conflict, and it would never ever help the Ancient Sword Sect. But I want the Ye Clan to give up the benefits of this.”

The Ye Clan’s ancestor suddenly asked, “Do you know what the benefits of it are?”

Ye Zhibei nodded, “I do. If the Ancient Sword Sect is destroyed, we will get a quarter of its wealth. There will be at least a few hundred thousand World Crystals, and at least 5 to 7 divine treasures. Besides that, there is that spirit vein, and the Soul Sect will have to compensate us with at least 30,000 World Crystals for that. All of those aren’t even the main point, the main point is we can establish our forces in the West Region and expand there. Moreover, once we occupy some territory over there, our Ye Clan’s profits will increase by at least 30%.”

The Ye Clan’s ancestor nodded slightly, “You’re correct, but you do not know about something. Once the Ancient Sword Sect is destroyed, the Soul Sect will join us, and we’ll have a better chance against the desolate race with their help.”

He gazed at Ye Zhibei and continued, “Of course, you can tell me your reasons, your reasons for supporting that kid. If it’s because you’re friends, then I’ll be very disappointed!”

Ye Zhibei fell silent for a long time, and then she looked him in the eyes, “Everything I said was based on success, and we will get all of that if it’s successful. But Ancestor, what if they fail?”

The Ye Clan’s ancestor fell silent this time.

Ye Zhibei sat by his side, “Ancestor, everything comes with its risks. Of course, there is no gain without risk, but it depends on the situation, right?”

He played with two jade green balls in his hands while he said, “Go on!”

She continued, “Ye Yang is Yang Ye. I’m sure you’re aware of that. But you seem to have forgotten something, and it’s that he has a Sprite Progenitor.”

The Sprite Progenitor!

The Ye Clan’s ancestor stopped playing with those balls when he heard her.

She grinned and said, “Ancestor, do you know what the heart is?”

He glanced at her and chuckled, “What? Are you trying to discuss the Dao with me?”

She shook her head, “I’ve been in contact with him, and do you know what I think of him?”

He smiled, “Tell me!”

Ye Zhibei said, “He’s someone who has a high regard for feelings and relationships. If he thinks it’s right, he will do it. Just like when he rushed into War City to save his friends. He doesn’t act based on his own interests. Take the Ancient Sword Sect for example. He can leave, but he still stayed. Is it because he covets the position of sect master? Or the sect’s treasures? I don’t think so. Authority is worthless to him. As for the sect’s treasures, he has Super Divine Treasures and divine treasures, so the Ancient Sword Sect’s treasures aren’t important to him either.”

She stood up slowly and looked ahead as she spoke, “His heart. He always follows his heart. That is why Xing Biqing and I are willing to be friends with him. Because we are certain he won’t stab us in the back. Moreover, so long as we need help, he will definitely come to our aid.”

She shook her head and chuckled at this point, “But we can’t do the same for him. Because we have too much to worry about. The first thing we consider can never be our own relationships, it is our interests instead. We must always think if it will be beneficial for our clans…”

The Ye Clan’s ancestor remained silent.

Ye Zhibei continued, “He’s a sword cultivator who fully follows his heart. Perhaps he isn’t a good person, but he’s absolutely not a bad person.”

She gazed at the Ye Clan’s ancestor and said, “Ancestor, I want to continue being his friend, and I want to lead the Ye Clan to continue being his friend. Of course, the Ye Clan doesn’t belong to me, it belongs to everyone. But if it’s possible, even if we don’t help him, we shouldn’t beat him when he’s down. Alright?”

The Ye Clan’s ancestor glanced at her and smiled, “You’ve spoken much more than you ever do!”

Ye Zhibei didn’t say another word and just waited for his decision.

Ye Zhibei’s ancestor gazed at the clouds for a long time, “You can make the decisions for the Ye Clan. Just do what you think is best for the clan.”

Ye Zhibei was visibly relieved. She bowed to him and walked away.

Meanwhile, the Ye Clan’s ancestor closed his eyes slowly, “That kid’s backing isn’t ordinary either…”

If Yang Ye didn’t have any backing, everything would be pointless.

Because killing him and the Ancient Sword Sect would be absolutely easy!

Unfortunately, Yang Ye had backing, and it was extremely powerful backing too. Thus, they had to abide by the rules when dealing with him. Once they did that, everything that was set in stone before this was full of variables again!

…

The Ancient Sword Sect. In the Primordial Pagoda.

After days of bitter cultivation, Yang Ye’s Sword Domain Sphere was pretty good now. Presently, he could unleash it with ease, but it wasn’t quite stable, and the slightest mistake would end in him injuring himself!

While there was a certain amount of danger, it was very, very powerful.

It was extremely terrifying, and it could be said that ordinary Lord Realm experts wouldn’t be able to endure it upon getting close to him!

Not to mention others, even he couldn’t really endure it!

Yang Ye didn’t continue training and left the Primordial Pagoda.

Outside the pagoda, the Soul Sect didn’t show signs of attacking yet.

As he stood outside the main hall, Yang Ye fell silent as he gazed at the darkness around the sect.

Wait for death to arrive?

Yang Ye shook his head. He felt that this wouldn’t do. Because the pressure was growing for the entire sect, and it would strike a huge blow to their overall morale!

Yang Ye gazed at the darkness for a long time, and then he said, “Summon the elite disciples!”

A short while later, the elite disciples arrived before Yang Ye, and all of them had a divine treasure!

These divine treasures were a part of the sect’s reserves!

Besides the elite disciples, Nether Maiden and the others appeared behind Yang Ye.

Yang Ye glanced at them, “Come with me!”

Yang Ye transformed into a ray of light that shot up into the sky.

Rays of light followed closely behind him.

Nether Maiden and the others hurried after him as well.

A short while later, they arrived before the darkness, and a wisp of viciousness flashed through Yang Ye’s eyes as he gazed at the dark encirclement around the sect. A moment later, the sheath on his waist shook, and then Executor shot forward!

Meanwhile, the Soul Sect’s Super Divine Treasure, the Soul Awl, emerged from the darkness!

The Soul Awl slammed itself against Executor!

A battle between Super Divine Treasures!

As soon as they collided, the sky shook, and waves of violent energy raged like a storm.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye appeared behind Executor, and then he grabbed it and shot into the darkness.

Nether Maiden’s expression changed slightly, and she was about to charge in when an explosion resounded from within the darkness. After that, countless rays of sword energy rippled out before the pitch black encirclement shattered before their eyes…

It didn’t take long for the darkness to gradually vanish.

The formation had been destroyed!

It had been destroyed by force!

Yang Ye’s strength wasn’t the same anymore. After all, even Executor had 90% of its strength now!

While its strength wasn’t fully unsealed, it couldn’t be compared to the past.

A group of mysterious black robed figures stood before Yang Ye, and they were led by the Soul Sect’s Exalt. Besides that, the two black robed figures who’d hunted him the other day were behind the Soul Exalt!

The woman in a black dress was by their side too!

Furthermore, there were three black clothed figures with pitch black spears standing behind the group, and they were souls without bodies.

The Soul Exalt stared at Yang Ye. He hadn’t expected this fellow to dare make the first move!

Yang Ye had actually made the first move!

Fortunately, the Soul Sect was prepared!

Yang Ye swung his sword. He didn’t want to waste his breath and was about to attack…

“AAAAAAH!” Suddenly, numerous shrill cries resounded from down below.

Yang Ye’s expression changed as he swiftly turned to look. The Ancient Sword Sect was under attack.

The Soul Exalt suddenly smiled, “As expected of the number one organization of assassins in Eternal Kingdom. They really are efficient!”
