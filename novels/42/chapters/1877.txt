Chapter 1878 – A Sword is Extraordinary because of its Master!

Of course, it wasn’t the Sovereign of Man’s real body!

It was a projection!

It was only a projection!

Yang Ye looked the Sovereign of Man in the eyes, and the latter was looking at him as well. Both of them didn’t say a word.

In the Primordial Pagoda, the sword was still trembling violently and intended to charge out of the pagoda. However, it was suppressed by the pagoda.

Suddenly, Yang Ye said, “Let it out!”

As soon as he gave the order, a ray of golden light shot out from Yang Ye’s chest. A moment later, the golden light dispersed to reveal the golden sword.

Yang Ye gazed at it, “Do as you please!”

The sword hadn’t acknowledged him as its master, so he refused to force it to stay.

The sword shook violently in midair and seemed to be conveying something. However, the Sovereign of Man’s projection was gradually turning ethereal. Three breaths of time later, it vanished from the sky.

Yang Ye frowned. Why didn’t he take the sword?

As if he knew what Yang Ye was wondering about, Hou Qing’s voice resounded in his mind, “Even though his projection was here, who knows how far away his main body is? Moreover, that projection can only be maintained for a short while. So, it isn’t that he didn’t want to take it with him, he couldn’t!”

Hou Qing paused for a moment and continued, “Kid, the Sovereign of Man will definitely not let this matter rest!”

Yang Ye replied, “Don’t they say that the Sovereign of Man is kind and benevolent?”

“Kind and benevolent?” Hou Qing laughed with ridicule, “Kid, that so-called kindness and benevolence in this world only exists under special circumstances. Take yourself as an example. Would you show kindness and benevolence to your enemies? Even if that person is a good person?”

Yang Ye shook his head. As far as he was concerned, it didn’t matter if a person was good or bad, all his enemies deserved death. Because he was very well aware that if they had the chance to kill him, then they would absolutely not show any mercy!

Hou Qing said, “Actually, the issue between you and the Sovereign of Man wasn’t serious. If you returned his sword, then perhaps nothing would happen. But now, you haven’t just learned the techniques of my shaman race, you’ve cultivated a devil cultivation technique. With the strength he possessed, he was definitely able to discern it. So, even if you return his sword now, he may not spare you.”

Yang Ye shrugged, “I’m not afraid of him!”

Hou Qing was stunned speechless.

Yang Ye gazed at the sword. He could sense that it had deep and strong feelings for the Sovereign of Man. He would naturally not feel jealous of that. Because the sword didn’t belong to him, and he’d never thought of taking possession of it!

If it was his, then it would be his, and no one could take it from him; but if it wasn’t his, then he would absolutely not try to keep it by force.

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts and glanced at the surroundings. He was about to leave when Hou Qing’s voice resounded in his mind, “Kid, get in here now! Something’s wrong with that little lord of yours!”

Little lord…

It was naturally Snowy!

Yang Ye immersed his consciousness into his body. He saw Snowy in front of Hou Qing while holding the two pieces of that broken sword, and she was blinking incessantly.

Hou Qing visibly relaxed when he saw Yang Ye.

Yang Ye asked, “What is it?”

Hou Qing replied, “That little fellow brought that sword to me and wants me to help her fix it… It has a consciousness of its own, and its materials are special, so how can I possibly repair it?”

She wanted to repair the sword!

Yang Ye felt speechless.

Snowy glanced at Hou Qing, glanced at Yang Ye, and then pointed at Hou Qing before pointing at the broken pieces of the sword in her arms.

Her intent was obvious.

Hou Qing’s head started to ache when he saw her act like that.

Yang Ye walked over to Snowy and said, “Why do you want to repair it?”

Snowy pointed at it and started waving her claws.

Pity!

Snowy felt that it was very pitiable.

Yang Ye gazed at the broken sword and fell silent. Since it entered the Primordial Pagoda, the sword had been laying silently in a corner.

It was sad!

Yang Ye was a sword cultivator, so he could sense its emotions. However, it was normal because it had been with the Unfettered One for so many years, so it definitely had grown attached to the Unfettered one. Just like the Sword Spirit, she’d been with him for so many years, and there was a very strong relationship between them.

But the Unfettered One had broken it and abandoned it for his own Sword Dao…

Meanwhile, Hou Qing suddenly said, “The owner of this sword… is really an outstanding figure. He can do what others can’t!”

Yang Ye nodded. The Unfettered One was extraordinary indeed. Moreover, he was an extremely formidable expert. However, if he was in the Unfettered One’s shoes, he would definitely be unable to do the same. As far as he was concerned, his loved ones were far more important than the Sword Dao!

He’d learned how to use the sword for his loved ones! Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Meanwhile, Hou Qing suddenly said, “If you really want to repair it, then perhaps that old flame may know how!”

That old flame!

He was naturally talking about the Divine Yin Flame!

Yang Ye glanced at the broken sword in his grasp. Should I repair it or not?

Meanwhile, Snowy suddenly grabbed Yang Ye’s hand and shook it lightly with a pleading gaze in her eyes.

Yang Ye rubbed her head gently and smiled, “Alright, let’s go to the old flame!”

Snowy cracked a smile when she heard him.

A moment later, they appeared before the Divine Yin Flame.

The Divine Yin Flame said, “Are you sure you want to reforge it?”

Yang Ye replied, “Repair it if it’s possible!”

The Divine Yin Flame replied, “Toss it in here!”

Yang Ye gazed at Snowy. The latter blinked, and then she tossed the sword into the furnace.

Snowy blinked and tried to look into the furnace. However, it only took a moment for her head to shrink back. She seemed to be quite afraid of fire.

A short while later, the Divine Yin Flame suddenly said, “This sword is extraordinary!”

“Extraordinary?” Yang Ye asked, “What’s extraordinary about it?”

The Divine Yin Flame replied, “You’ll know soon enough!”

Yang Ye felt speechless.

Around two hours later, a sword suddenly flew out from the pill furnace.

The sword was around 1m long, one and a half fingers wide, and smooth like a mirror. But besides that, there was nothing special about it.

Suddenly, Snowy flipped her paw, and the sword flew into her left paw. At the same time, she stretched out her right pawn, and another sword flew into it. It was the Sovereign of Man’s sword!

Yang Ye glanced at the swords before him. Suddenly, the Sovereign of Man’s sword suddenly emanated a wave of terrifying sword energy that slammed down towards the Unfettered One’s sword.

Obviously, the arrival of a new sword made it feel threatened.

Suddenly, a sword howl resounded, and then the sword in Snowy’s left paw shot towards the Sovereign of Man’s sword.

Snowy hurriedly released them. Just like that, Yang Ye and Snowy watched with astonishment as the Unfettered One’s sword and the Sovereign of Man’s sword started fighting in midair.

The swords were fighting!

Yang Ye was quite stunned. But it didn’t take long for him to be quite bewildered. The Sovereign of Man’s sword was a divine treasure, but while the Unfettered One’s sword was extraordinary, it was definitely not a divine treasure. So, how could it fight the Sovereign of Man’s sword?”

“That’s what is extraordinary about it!” The Divine Yin Flame said, “Kid, you must remember that a sword is extraordinary because of its master. Even though it wasn’t forged by countless experts and precious materials like the Sovereign of Man’s sword, its owner is extraordinary!”

Yang Ye spoke solemnly, “What do you mean?”

The Divine Yin Flame said, “I mean that you need a sword that suits you the best and foster it. When your attainment in the Sword Dao reaches the Dao, you’ll notice that even a blade of grass in your hand would be better than the Sovereign of Man’s sword. The strength of a sword isn’t decided by it, it’s decided by the person using it. If the person using it is invincible, then the sword would naturally be invincible as well!”

A sword is extraordinary because of its master!

Yang Ye flipped his palm, and the Sword Precursor appeared there. His sword was naturally the Sword Precursor. It was the sword that had been with him from the beginning.

A long time passed before Yang Ye suddenly chuckled, “The Divine Yin Flame is right, I don’t need the strongest sword, I need the sword that’s most suitable to me.”

“Let her into your sea of consciousness and use it to nourish her!” Meanwhile, the Divine Yin Flame instructed, “Your sword intent is extraordinary. If you use it to ceaselessly nourish her in your sea of consciousness, then she won’t just gradually grow stronger, it’ll truly connect your hearts and mind as one!”

Yang Ye nodded, and then he placed the Sword Precursor within his sea of consciousness.

After that, he played with Snowy for a while, and then he left the Primordial Pagoda. Meanwhile, there was quite a bit of commotion in the Primordial Pagoda.

It was mainly those two swords. Both refused to acknowledge the other as superior, so they kept fighting at all times. Of course, they were very smart, and they always tried to curry favor with Snowy.

Snowy!

The little overlord of the Primordial Pagoda. Not to mention those two swords, even old fellows like Qiong Qi and Hou Qing didn’t dare to offend her.

However, Snowy had quite a headache. Because those two swords kept fighting for no reason…

Yang Ye paid no attention to Snowy and the two swords. He had an even more important matter to do, and it was to look for the Sky Devils!

Cultivate!

Not to mention in the upper universe, the 6th stage of the True Realm wasn’t enough even in the medium universe. So, he had to improve his strength as soon as possible!

Silence!

As he walked through the boundless world in the 11th level, the only thing Yang Ye sensed was silence, extreme silence.

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings, and then he slowly clenched his right fist.

“Hehehe…” Suddenly, slightly chilling laughter resounded in Yang Ye’s mind.

Yang Ye stopped moving!
