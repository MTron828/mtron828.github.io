Chapter 2769 – The Sword is Blood!

Yang Ye watched as the Sword Precursor and Justice collided.

Bang!

In an instant, the starry sky shook violently, and then countless rays of sword energy shot toward the surroundings.

Yang Ye watched as some fragments crashed down from above.

The Sword Precursor’s fragments!

It had been destroyed!

Yang Ye gazed at the fragments in silence.

A moment later, they descended before Yang Ye.

Yang Ye touched them gently, and then he collected all of them.

At this moment, he couldn’t contact the Sword Spirit anymore.

He looked up at Justice, and it was glowing with sword energy as it gradually descended toward him.

Yang Ye cracked a smile and stretched out his hand. An instant later, a blood red sword appeared in his grasp!

The Sword Precursor!

At a distant point in the clouds, a woman who was playing a game of Go suddenly looked down. A short while later, she grinned, “A pretty good sword. A sword needs a good master, but the sword itself is important. Seeking the ordinary through death, and a sword made of blood. Interesting indeed…”

In the starry sky, Yang Ye launched a fierce upward slash.

The blood red sword energy was so powerful that it seemed like it could slash the universe apart!

Boom!

An explosion resounded, and countless strands of blood red sword energy shot toward the surroundings. At the same time, a figure gradually fell from above.

It was Yang Ye. One of his arms was gone!

As for Justice, it was still there.

No matter how terrifying the blood red sword energy around it was, they couldn’t get close to Justice!

Justice didn’t attack again and just vanished into outer space.

A sword descended by a Go board high above in the clouds.

Meanwhile, a voice resounded before her, “You’re not killing him?”

She shook her head, “Why would I? I just taught him a lesson. After all, it’s not good if he keeps mouthing off all the time.”

The voice replied, “While he’s quite weak, his future is limitless. Aren’t you afraid that you’ll suffer the consequences of not killing him now.”

The woman shot a glance forward, “Do you know the difference between us?”

The voice remained silent.

She smiled, “The strong are never afraid of strong opponents, and the strong may even foster strong opponents.”

She put a piece down once she finished speaking, “That mad fellow down below is a smart one. He intentionally infuriated me to seek an advancement in death. You’re inferior to him in that aspect. If you dared to disregard your fate and fight me all those years ago, your strength wouldn’t be this weak.”

The voice replied, “At most times, forbearance guarantees a future!”

The woman grinned, “A future as a great turtle?”

She received no reply.

The woman chuckled, “You know… If that fellow down there were seated before me, he would definitely swing his sword at me when I said that. Just like how he didn’t hesitate to swing his sword when we met for the first time down there. Sword cultivators should be like that, and so should me!”

She still received no reply.

She didn’t say anything and just continued playing.

…

In the starry sky.

Yang Ye descended slowly. Finally, a long time later, he stopped, and his body started to recover.

Around two hours later, Yang Ye stood up.

A woman in a blood red dress was standing before him.

The Sword Spirit!

She gazed at Yang Ye in silence.

Yang Ye walked over to her, touched her face gently, and said, “Don’t be so rash next time, alright?”

She nodded.

Yang Ye smiled. Meanwhile, she transformed into a ray of blood red sword energy that entered his forehead.

Yang Ye closed his eyes slowly.

The Sword Precursor’s body was actually his own blood!

In the past, when he used his blood to feed the Sword Precursor, he’d been using his blood to forge her body with his blood. It could be said that so long as he remained alive, the Sword Precursor would never fall. Of course, it had still been dangerous because the strongest form of Destiny was too, too strong.

If she attacked seriously, she may have obliterated the Sword Precursor for real!

Yang Ye had planned to fight Destiny to seek an advancement of his own strength, but he hadn’t expected the Sword Precursor to charge forward when Justice appeared.

She had the same thoughts as him, she wanted to see a breakthrough too!

Unfortunately, both of them had failed to truly undergo a breakthrough. However, they’d gained a lot from the collision as well!

A huge amount of gains!

Both of them had been ready to die earlier! They had risked their lives to seek the ordinary!

While it had been quite rash, they had no other choice!

Yang Ye had a lot of ties and many people behind him. However, he would never shrink back when he should risk his life!

If he worried about this and that, the final outcome would be failure to accomplish anything!

He was already in a hopeless situation. All his enemies were stronger than him, so if he still acted fearfully and hesitantly, then he would really have no future.

In this battle, both he and the Sword Spirit had undergone a huge improvement in their mental state. Especially the Sword Spirit. If she could be said to have been half a step away from attaining the Ordinary Sword Realm, then now, she was just a thin barrier away from attaining it.

She didn’t have to take a step forward. She just had to tap a finger forward and the barrier would be torn apart!

As for Yang Ye, he’d gained quite a bit too. While he’d lost, he’d experienced Destiny’s strength!

Losing allowed one to discern their flaws and how to improve!

It could be said that losing was his greatest gain!

Yang Ye looked up and left.

Universe City. A ray of sword energy descended here.

Countless in the city heaved sighs of relief upon sensing the sword energy.

Yang Ye entered the hall, and only Ding Shaoyao, who was dealing with the city’s management, was here.

She stopped what she was doing and looked up at Yang Ye. The latter spoke solemnly, “I must leave the city!”

She frowned slightly, “You plan to take the battlefield outside?”

Yang Ye nodded, “Indeed! This city and universe cannot endure war. So, I want to stop them out there!”

Ding Shaoyao fell silent.

Yang Ye continued, “Besides that, we can’t just sit here and wait for death to arrive. I’ve never liked taking a passive stance, as that will only lead to a slow death.”

She spoke solemnly, “You’ve made your decision?”

Yang Ye nodded, “I’ll be the first line of defense. Besides that, I want to improve my strength through battle!”

Improve himself!

At a time like this, he didn’t have time to comprehend and cultivate slowly.

No one would give him the time for that!

He had to fight incessantly and improve in battle. Of course, he may die in battle too!

Ding Shaoyao said, “I’ve asked Senior Emperor Corpse to look for the Unfettered One. If he’s willing to help…”

Yang Ye shook his head, “We can’t place our hopes on someone else! If we do that, we will rely on them, and then we will have hope that we’ll get lucky. That’s a bad thing!”

In the past, he’d relied on too many things, and now, he didn’t want to rely on anyone!

Ding Shaoyao gazed at Yang Ye for a long time, and then she suddenly smiled.

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Why are you smiling?”

Ding Shaoyao spoke softly, “The youth has finally grown up. You’re much more mature than before.”

Yang Ye smiled, “People change! Help me gather everyone here so that I can explain things to them.”

She nodded.

In the hall, all the Destiny Realm experts throughout the city were gathered here!

Besides Destiny Realm experts, there were around 20 other experts. They were the representatives of some of the large worlds. While their status wasn’t great here, they were absolutely influential in their own worlds!

Of course, they remained very humble here.

Yang Ye glanced at them, “I’ve decided to take the battlefield outside. In other words, I'll stop the experts of the Four Dimensional Universe outside the city.”

The others exchanged glances. In the end, Huang Ying said, “Brother Yang, that’s a little dangerous. We have the Universe Formation here, and it’s more suitable to wait for the battle to arrive!”

“I agree!” Suddenly, Jian Wudi spoke abruptly, “We’ll have to passively suffer attacks if we stay here. So, why don’t we take the initiative instead?”

Someone suddenly said, “It’s still quite risky!”

“No it isn’t. I agree with City Governor Yang, let’s head out there and fight them…”

An argument broke out in the hall.

But it didn’t take long for them to stop and gaze at Yang Ye.

Yang Ye said, “You’re all correct. However, I still side with heading out there. Fighting here will harm this world, and staying in a passive position is very, very disadvantageous to us. The best defense is a good offense!”

He stood up and said, “All of you stay here, I’ll go myself.”

The others were shocked by this. Meanwhile, Huang Ying hurriedly said, “Brother Yang, if you really plan to head out there, we can go together. This isn’t your responsibility alone, it’s ours. So, we’ll face it together!”T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

The others quickly nodded to display their agreement.

However, Yang Ye shook his head, “I’ll be a greater threat to them on my own. Because I can run when I’m no match for them. But if all of you go, it’ll be a final battle instead. That would be disadvantageous to us.”

They wanted to say more, but Yang Ye raised his right hand to make them stop.

They stopped speaking, and Yang Ye continued, “Once I leave, I will be the first line of defense, and all of you will be the second line of defense. During this time, continue recruiting experts and cultivating. Our world is huge, and I’m sure there are more Destiny Realm experts.”

He paused for a moment and continued, “Besides that, Advisor Ding will represent me in my absence. The Council of Elders can impeach her and remove her from her position. Of course, I don’t hope to see all of you engaging in internal strife.”

Huang Ying suddenly said, “You can rest at ease, Brother Yang. We may have differences and disputes, and it is very normal, but if anyone dares to cause trouble, my desolate race will be the first to deal with them!”

The desolate race could be considered as one of the strongest powers in the universe, and it was only inferior to the Eternal Kingdom’s War Dimension.

Yang Ye gazed at Liu Yuan, the representative of the War Dimension, and she spoke solemnly, “Don’t worry, if anyone dares to carry out any schemes, I’ll be the first to kill them!”

Yang Ye nodded, “If I don’t return, please hold your heads up high and keep your backs straight against Destiny and the Four Dimensional Universe. We can die, but we will die on our feet!”

He walked off once he finished speaking.

They watched as Yang Ye walked out of the hall and vanished into the sky.

Everyone bowed toward the exit and maintained that bowing posture for some time.
