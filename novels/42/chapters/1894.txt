Chapter 1895 – I’ll Teach You How To Act!

A short while later, her soul vanished completely.

She’d been tortured to death!

Yang Ye didn’t let her apologize and just tortured her to death. Normally, he wouldn’t do that because he wasn’t fond of torturing people. However, he felt that even letting her die was letting her off easily!

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts, and then he brought Zhi’er to her grandfather.

Yang Ye rubbed her head and gazed at the old man, “I want to take her with me and help her.”

The old man immediately knelt down when he heard Yang Ye, “Thank you… Thank you, Immortal! Thank you…”

He would naturally not stop the old man. Because he knew very well what his actions meant, it meant that Zhi’er’s fate would be changed.

Fortune and luck. It was Zhi’er’s fortune and luck!

Meanwhile, a gust of wind pushed the old man up, and Yang Ye said, “You said that her parents went to cultivate. Do you know where?”

The old man replied, “I think it’s a place called Floating Mountain.”

Yang Ye asked, “They abandoned their daughter to cultivate?”

Zhi’er lowered her head slightly when she heard Yang Ye. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

The old man laughed bitterly, “An immortal passed by one day and saw them. That immortal said their physique isn’t bad and wanted to guide them onto the path of cultivation. They knew it was a once-in-a-lifetime chance. So, they agreed. However, Zhi’er was still young, and they couldn’t take her with them. Even that immortal refused. So…”

Yang Ye gazed at the young girl, rubbed her head, and said, “Fate brought us together. I’ll take you to see them.”

As far as he was concerned, it merely took a few days. Besides because of his fondness for her, he was helping her for another reason, and it was because he was the reason she’d suffered earlier.

Besides fondness, there was a trace of guilt!

Yang Ye flicked ten energy pearls to the old man, “It can lengthen your lifespan. Take care!”

The old man glanced at the energy pearls and gazed at the young girl. The young girl spoke softly, “Grandpa, I’ll come back. Wait for me.”

The old man grinned, “Alright, I’ll wait for you.”

Yang Ye nodded, and then he took her hand and vanished into the sky.

The old man looked up at the ray of light in the sky with a slightly blank gaze, “Grandpa probably won’t be able to wait until you return…”

…

Once they left the village, Yang Ye flew almost two hours before he finally arrived at a real city.

After entering the city and asking around, Yang Ye finally found out where Floating Mountain was. He didn’t stay a while longer in the city and left for Floating Mountain.

Yang Ye had thought it would take just a few hours to get there, but he was wrong. The Human Dimension’s size truly surpassed his expectations. He’d flown for almost an entire day and night before he finally arrived there.

Floating Mountain, it was one of the ten paradises of the Human Dimension.

It wasn’t just a single mountain but 36 mountains, and all of them floated in the sky. Clouds and mist coiled around the top of the mountains, and mysterious white cranes flew by from time to time. It was truly like a mountain residence of immortals!

The Floating Sect!

The Floating Sect resided on Floating Mountain.

Yang Ye didn’t just fly straight into the sect. He wasn’t an idiot. If he did that, it would definitely cause endless trouble for him. Most importantly, he didn’t have the strength to fight the entire sect on his own.

The Floating Sect couldn’t be compared to those powers of the lower universe. It was a true titan, and even the Sovereign of Man had to be careful when dealing with one of the ten paradises.

There was a city below the mountains, and it was called Floating City.

Even though the Floating Sect stood high above the masses, it couldn’t fully separate itself from the world of mortals. Because their disciples were selected from the mortal world, and Floating City was a station between the Floating Sect and the mortal world.

Besides that, everyone who came to visit Floating Sect would first find a place to stay in Floating City. There was a path in Floating City and below Floating Mountain, it was called the Floating Path.

It was a test.

Anyone who could pass through it would be allowed to join the Floating Sect and become an outer court disciple.

There was nothing special about the Floating Path. At the very least, it looked very ordinary.

Yang Ye couldn’t help but feel slightly conflicted as he gazed at the Floating Path. Do I really have to go through this path? How will I go to Floating Mountain if I don’t?

Yang Ye had planned to sneak in, but Hou Qing had stopped him.

Because besides an array of powerful and mysterious grand formations, it had extraordinary experts too!

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and decided to use the test as his way into Floating Mountain. He was only here to find Zhi’er’s parents; he wasn’t here to cause trouble. So, sneaking in wasn’t necessary.

“You’re going to try the Floating Path?” Suddenly, a clear and melodious voice came from Yang Ye’s right. Yang Ye turned to look, and he saw a man in green clothes. The man was simply too beautiful. He had red lips, white teeth, willow leaf shaped brows, large eyes, and an extremely slender figure. It could be said that even women would feel inferior before him.

Yang Ye glanced at the man and immediately realized that it wasn’t a man at all; it was a woman dressed as a man. Moreover, the woman was clearly not trying to conceal it.

Yang Ye withdrew his gaze and nodded.

The woman grinned, “Brother, do you know what the Floating Path is for?”

Yang Ye shook his head.

She said, “The Floating Path was created by the Floating Sect’s Master many years ago, and it’s naturally here to help the Floating Sect select extraordinary geniuses. Actually, the Floating Sect isn’t the only one, all the other paradises have similar tests.”

Yang Ye turned to look at her, “What are you trying to say?”

She suddenly withdrew a folding fan and fanned herself lightly while smiling silently.

Yang Ye felt speechless.

Suddenly, Yang Ye turned to the side, and an old man in a blue robe had suddenly appeared before them.

The old man was very strong!

Yang Ye’s expression became quite solemn. The feeling the old man gave him was like the feeling Hao Tian gave him. Unfathomable!

Hou Qing hadn’t lied to him! The Floating Sect wasn’t ordinary at all!

The old man ignored Yang Ye and gazed at the woman instead, “If I’m not wrong, you’re the one who has gone through nine paradises, Nansi Yin, right?”

She grinned, “I am!”

The old man pondered deeply for a moment and said, “You’re here to get through my sect’s Floating Path?”

She pointed at the Floating Path before her and said, “It’s the last one.”

The old man said, “While it’s a little rude, I have to ask. Why are you doing this? Is it because you’re trying to prove your natural talent to the world?”

“Not at all!” Nansi Yin grinned, “I don’t have to prove anything to anyone. I’m only doing this because I made a bet with a friend. My friend said that if I’m able to get through the trials of all ten paradises and break the records there, then she’ll be my maidservant for three years. Conversely, I’ll be her maidservant for three years. Now, I’m just one trial away from that.”

The old man glanced at her and asked, “Who are you?”

“I can’t say!” Nansi Yin grinned, “You won’t stop me, right?”

The old man asked, “What if I do?”

Nansi Yin grinned and withdrew a piece of jade. The old man’s expression changed drastically when he saw it. He took a deep and long glance at her and said, “So you’re from there…”

Nansi Yin shrugged, “Can I start now?”

The old man nodded, “Yes!”

Nansi Yin was about to step foot on the Floating Path when she suddenly seemed to have thought of something, and she asked, “What’s the best record?”

The old man replied, “27 breaths!”

27!

Nansi Yin glanced at the path. It wasn’t very long and just stretched forward for 3km. It looked like a normal path. So, if one moved at an ordinary speed, it would take around 100 breaths of time at most. However, it was difficult to maintain one’s speed on that path!

Suddenly, she smiled, “20, 20 breaths of time are enough!”

The old man’s eyelids twitched. He glanced at her and remained silent.

Meanwhile, she gazed at Yang Ye, “Young man, are you sure that you want to watch?”

Yang Ye gazed at her with a puzzled expression in his eyes.

She smiled, “It’s nothing. I’m just afraid that it’ll be a blow to your confidence!”

A strange expression appeared on Yang Ye’s face.

Meanwhile, the old man suddenly said, “That young brother isn’t ordinary!”

“I know!” Nansi Yin smiled, “I wouldn’t have wasted my breath on him if he wasn’t.” She paused for a moment and continued, “Brother, how about we play a game? It’ll be really fun.”

Yang Ye hadn’t even spoken when she added, “I’ll let you start first for 20 breaths of time, and then I’ll start after you. If I win, I want something from you.”

“You want something?” Yang Ye frowned slightly, “What?”

Nansi Yin pointed at the sword in Yang Ye’s grasp, “It!”

His sword!

After he arrived at the large universe, Yang Ye would naturally not let his guard down, so his sword was always in his grasp. However, he wasn’t using the Sword Precursor because it was being nurtured in his sea of consciousness, so it couldn’t fight with him for now.

It wasn’t the Sword Precursor, and it wasn’t the Sovereign of Man’s holy sword. After all, using that sword would cause a lot of trouble for him.

He was using the Unfettered One’s sword!

Even though he wasn’t its owner, he could still use it. The sword acted quite sensibly and cooperated as well.

Yang Ye moved his gaze away and gazed at her, “What if you lose?”

“What if I lose?” She was slightly stunned, and then she smiled, “Is that even possible?”

Yang Ye replied, “What if?”

Nansi Yin smiled, “What do you want?”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and replied, “I need a maidservant too. Be my maidservant if I lose, alright?”

The old man’s expression changed when he heard Yang Ye, and then he glanced at Yang Ye and shook his head while speaking to himself, He’s courting death!

Nansi Yin’s eyes opened wide, and she looked at Yang Ye for quite some time before she roared with laughter, “Good! Very good! Your maidservant! Very good indeed! It’s decided then. I’ll be your maidservant. It’s a promise! Come, go on! I’ll give you 20 breaths of time before I start!”

Meanwhile, Yang Ye walked over to her and spoke seriously, “I’m very strong, but I never proclaim it. Watch, I’ll teach you how to act properly!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he stepped onto the Floating Path.
