Chapter 1926 – Who’s Trash?

Right when they were about to enter through the Sky Gate, a middle aged man in silver armor appeared before them.

He glanced at them and stated, “Name yourselves!”

Yin Hou took a step forward, “The shaman race’s Yin Hou is here on order from the Shaman Emperor to meet the Sovereign of Sky!”

The shaman race? The middle aged man frowned, “Do you have the command token?”

Yin Hou flicked a pitch black command token to the middle aged man.

The middle aged man glanced at it and nodded slightly, “It’s real. Please come with me.”

He entered the Sky Gate once he finished speaking.

Yin Hou waved her hand and all of them vanished on the spot.

Once they went through the gate, the scene before them warped, and then they felt dizzy.

Sometime later, Yang Ye opened his eyes slowly.

A blue sky, white clouds, and clear air!

Yang Ye sized up the surroundings. He was in a huge square right now. It was simply inconceivably huge, and his current vision was actually unable to see the ends of it.

It was boundless.

“South Sky Battlefield.” Meanwhile, Yin Hou’s voice came from Yang Ye’s side, “It was once a battlefield, and a shocking battle was carried out here. Millions died here.”

A battlefield!

Yang Ye asked, “The sky race fought a different race?”

Yin Hou nodded in response.

Yang Ye said, “Then I guess the sky race won.”

Yin Hou shook her head slightly, “They didn’t win or lose.”

Yang Ye wanted to ask more, but she said, “Let’s go.”

She tapped her right foot down, and then she floated off into the distance.

Li Wu, Li Jiang, and the others quickly followed after her.

Yang Ye fell silent for a moment, and then he tapped his right foot down and transformed into a ray of light that followed after her.

All along the way, Yang Ye ceaselessly sized up the surroundings.

Actually, there was nothing special about it. If one insisted on finding something different about it, then it was the spirit energy here. The spirit energy here was extremely pure, and even the air was extremely clean and refreshing.

Besides that, some cities were extremely luxurious, unique, and seemed like immortal paradises.

Every time they passed by a city, a few experts would obstruct their path. However, those experts would leave once they saw the command token Yin Hou had. But they weren’t very friendly!

Yang Ye asked, “How much longer?”

Yin Hou looked up at the sky, and some time passed before she replied, “A day!”

A day! Yang Ye was stunned, “That long?”

Yin Hou nodded, “The Sovereign of Sky resides in Sky City. Sky City is at the center of the Sky Dimension, so we have to pass through the Endless Ocean before we can get there. Oh, we’ve reached the Endless Ocean!”

Everyone looked down. Sure enough, a boundless ocean was below them.

Meanwhile, Yin Hou suddenly said, “Be careful!”

Yang Ye asked, “It’s dangerous?”

Yin Hou nodded, “The Endless Ocean is guarded by one of the four Divine Generals of the Sky Dimension, Gu Nie. He’s fond of battle and frequently causes trouble…”

Bang!

Suddenly, a pillar of water shot up from below, and it was like a water dragon that surged at them.

Yin Hou’s face instantly fell. She raised her hand slightly and slapped it down.

Boom!

The space below them shook violently, and the pillar of water was obliterated. A bottomless pit appeared in the area of the ocean below them. The water in the surroundings converged over incessantly, but it was still unable to fill the hole!

“So it’s the shaman race’s Yin Hou who has come this time!” Suddenly, a voice resounded, and then a middle aged man appeared not too far away from them. The middle aged man seemed to be around the age of 30, and he wore armor that had faint light floating through it.

There were two young men behind him.

Yin Hou glanced indifferently at the middle aged man and said, “What is it, Gu Nie? You want to spar with me?”

Gu Nie smiled, “Exactly. I wonder if you’ll give me the honor?”

Yin Hou smiled, “Then bring it!”

As soon as she finished speaking, she glanced at Li Jiang and the others, “Stay here and wait!”

She vanished into the sky once she finished speaking.

The middle aged man glanced at Li Jiang and the others, and then he vanished into the sky as well.

Once they left, the man in an embroidered robe smiled, “You’re the geniuses of the shaman race, right? I’m Gu Bang, and this is my younger brother, Gu He.”

Li Jiang took a step forward and cupped his fist, “I’m Li Jiang. This is my younger sister, Li Tong, and that’s my cousin sister, Li Wu. As for him…”

He glanced at Yang Ye and said, “I don’t know who he is! In any case, he isn’t from my shaman race!”

Gu Bang grinned, “That’s fine.” He paused for a moment and continued, “All of you have quite strong auras, so I presume you’re quite strong. Why don’t we spar too?”

Spar!

Yang Ye glanced at Gu Bang. While Gu Bang had a grin on his face, Yang Ye felt that Gu Bang didn’t have good intentions at all.

Li Jiang was slightly hesitant. He wasn’t afraid of sparring with Gu Bang, it was because Yin Hou had told them to stay and wait.

Suddenly, Gu He laughed coldly, “Big Brother, people from the lower dimensions are cowardly like turtles. What’s the point of fighting them?”

Li Jiang and the others' faces fell.

Meanwhile, Gu Bang spoke apologetically, “Sorry, my brother is a little straightforward, and he likes to speak his mind. I apologize for his offense.”

Meanwhile, Gu He suddenly added, “All three of you can join forces against me!”

Gu He gazed at the others with a cold smile on his face.

Provocation!

Li Jiang was naturally unable to endure it, and he intended to accept the challenge. However, his younger sister, Li Tong, suddenly grabbed him and shook her head, “They’re doing it on purpose!”

Li Jiang glanced at Gu Bang and Gu He. Meanwhile, Gu He suddenly chuckled, “So, the so-called geniuses of the shaman race are trash like you? How truly disappointing! Absolutely disappointing!”

“Let’s fight!” Suddenly, Li Jiang stepped forward.

Li Tong wanted to say something when she witnessed this, but Li Jiang waved his hand and stopped her. He shot over to Gu He and said, “Didn’t you want to fight? Come! I’ll fight you!”

A smile curled up on the corners of Gu He’s mouth, “Since you’re that confident, then how about we make a bet?”

Li Jiang spoke coldly, “What bet?”

Gu He smiled, “If you lose, say the shaman race is useless; if I lose, I’ll say the sky race is useless. Alright?”

Li Jiang’s face became unsightly.

The shaman race is useless!

He’d realized the horrifying consequences of saying that. Once he lost and news of what happened here spread to the Shaman Dimension, he would become the enemy of the entire shaman race. Moreover, his father would be the first to go after him!

Li Jiang was slightly hesitant!

“What? You’re afraid?” Gu He chuckled, “If you’re afraid, just say so. I won’t ask you for a spar because members of my sky race don’t try to spar with cowards!”

Li Tong pulled lightly on Li Jiang’s sleeve and shook her head.

Meanwhile, Li Jiang took a deep breath and said, “Do you remember what Lady Yin Hou said? She said we should keep a low profile, but we should make a show of strength when necessary. We can’t cower from it. If we don’t accept the challenge now, our shaman race will become the laughingstock of the other races, and how will we return to face the shaman race?”

Li Jiang took a step forward and said, “Come, allow me to experience the strength of a genius from the sky race!”

Gu He took a step forward and smiled, “As you wish!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Gu He took a deep breath, and then he transformed into a shadow that shot towards Li Jiang.

Bang!

As soon as Gu He vanished, everyone clearly sensed the space here tremble.

It was caused by the extreme speed he was traveling at!

He was absolutely fast! Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Li Jiang’s face was instantly covered by a solemn expression. However, his reaction wasn’t slow at all, and he clenched his fists before an earthen yellow barrier of light instantly appeared before him.

Bang!

A fist slammed against the barrier of light, causing it to instantly explode into bits. An instant later, that fist went straight through and slammed against Li Jiang’s chest.

Boom!

However, Li Jiang didn’t move an inch!

An earthen yellow glow flickered around him.

Li Jiang cracked a smile, “The physical defenses of my shaman race isn’t something you can penetrate! You…”

Suddenly, Gu He unfurled his fist and grabbed Li Jiang’s throat. After that, he raised his right knee and kneed Li Jiang in the stomach!

Bam!

Li Jiang’s eyes instantly opened wide, and his eyes were filled with pain.

However, Gu He suddenly slammed his fist towards Li Jiang’s temple.

Li Jiang was blasted away. However, it only took a moment for his sister, Li Tong, to catch him. Once she caught him, blood sprayed out incessantly from his mouth, and it only took a moment for his chest to be dyed red while pain covered his face.

Li Tong glanced coldly at Gu He, “How despicable!”

“Despicable?” Gu He chuckled, “How can you say that about me? He wasn’t able to react in time, and his body wasn’t strong enough. You can only blame him for being too weak!”

As he spoke, he glanced at Li Tong, Li Wu, and Yang Ye, and then he said, “Allow me to be honest. I didn’t want to waste my time on trash from the lower dimensions like you, but…”

Suddenly, a voice resounded, “Who’s trash?”

Gu He replied, “I meant all of you!”

The corners of Li Wu’s mouth curled up. She glanced at Yang Ye while seeming to have thought of something.

Because it was Yang Ye who’d asked that question.

Yang Ye smiled, “Yes. Trash was talking about all of us. That’s true!”

Gu He gazed at Yang Ye, and then he raised three fingers, “Three breaths of time from now, your mouth will be separated from your head!”

Yang Ye raised his hand above his head and said, “In the past, many people have threatened me just like you have. Now, the grass on their graves is about this high.”

Everyone was stunned speechless by this.
