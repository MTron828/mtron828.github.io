Chapter 1462 – The Present Enjoys And The Future Suffers!

Many figures were hanging from a mountain wall not too far ahead from Yang Ye. There were both men and women of all ages, and there were around 100 of them. All of them wore snow white robes.

The mountain wall behind them was densely covered in symbols that formed a circle, and all the figures were within that circle.

The symbols were spinning according to a certain pattern, and threads of dark brown energy were surging incessantly towards the people within the circle.

Yang Ye noticed that their eyes were closed. They weren’t dead and seemed to be in deep sleep.

Who are they?

Why are they trapped here?

Yang Ye frowned. Suddenly, the palm on his shoulder moved to his back, and then it started to move.

Save!

She’d merely written a single word, and it was ‘save’.

Yang Ye gazed at the symbols and fell silent. Save them? It’s absolutely not that simple. If it was just that, then based on the strength she possesses, she probably wouldn’t need my help. But she wants my help. That’s very unusual.

Suddenly, the woman’s hand started to move on his back again.

Please!

This time, she wrote a single word as well, and it was ‘please’.

Yang Ye remained silent for a long time, and then he flicked a strand of sword energy towards the circle of symbols. However, as soon as it arrived around 10m from the symbols, the circle started to revolve swiftly, and then a beam of light suddenly surged out from it. The beam of light was extremely swift and instantly slammed against Yang Ye’s sword energy.

Bang!

The sword energy shattered, but the beam of light hadn’t vanished and instantly arrived in front of Yang Ye.

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly, and then he slammed his fist forward. However, as soon as he did, the circle of symbols suddenly started spinning rapidly, and then numerous beams of light rained down upon Yang Ye.

Yang Ye’s expression changed, and his Quasi Returnal Rank sword intent and slaughter intent surged out from his body before slamming against the beams of light.

Bang!

An explosion resounded, and then Yang Ye was pushed backwards repeatedly. In an instant, Yang Ye had been pushed back into the village.

As soon as he stopped himself, his expression changed once more because he noticed to his astonishment that a dense expanse of symbols which looked like the symbols on the mountain wall had suddenly appeared beneath his feet. Yang Ye swept them with his divine sense, and he noticed that the ground of the entire village was covered in such symbols.

Yang Ye thought to himself, Crap!

Sure enough, the symbols beneath his feet and the symbols on the distant mountain wall started to spin madly. A moment later, countless beams of light shot out from the mountain wall. At the same time, countless beams of light shot out from the ground throughout the village.

The beams of light shot up into the air and lit up the entire sky.

The beams of light had surged out continuously for around an hour before they gradually vanished, and another hour passed before the symbols were back to spinning at their initial speed.

At this moment, an ice casket had appeared at the center of Spirit Village. A short while passed before the lid was slowly opened, and then Yang Ye sat up within it.

Yang Ye couldn’t help but heave a sigh of relief when he saw that the beams of light had vanished. After all, he’d almost died just now. Those beams of light were extremely powerful. Every single one was on par with an attack that carried the full strength of a Deity. If he hadn’t told Little Sky to bring out the casket at the critical moment, then he would have definitely been blasted into bits!

What formation is that? It’s that terrifying?

Even though he was very curious, Yang Ye didn’t have the time to think about that. Yang Ye made Little Sky put the ice casket back into the Primordial Pagoda, and then he turned around and walked away.

However, right when he was about to leave Spirit Village, the hand appeared on his shoulder again and refused to let him leave.

Yang Ye took a deep breath and said, “I’m sure you saw that. I can’t resist that formation at all. So, I’m sorry. Even though I want to help you save them, I’m really helpless.”

The hand moved to his back and started to write.

You can!

Those were the words that she’d written.

“Are you kidding?!” Yang Ye was quite annoyed, “You saw that! I was almost blasted into bits. Please, Big Sis, please go find someone else, alright? I’m really unable to help with this.”

Being generous and helping others depended on the situation! This matter had clearly exceeded his ability. If it wasn’t for the ice casket, he would have definitely died. However, it allowed him to determine that the ice casket was much stronger than he’d imagined! Because it was actually fine after being struck by that many beams of light!

It really was an extraordinary treasure!

A short moment of silence ensued before the woman’s palm started moving on Yang Ye’s back again.

This time, it was more words — You’ll be compensated. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

I’ll be compensated? Yang Ye was slightly stunned. He hadn’t expected her to actually start trying to tempt him. He thought for a moment and shook his head, “Compensation had nothing to do with it. I’m serious, if it was within my ability, then I would even help you for free. However, it has exceeded the scope of my ability. Right, what is the compensation you spoke of? I’m just asking....”

Meanwhile, her hand started to move again.

Yang Ye’s face gradually became solemn. Because she said that the compensation was even better than his ice casket!

It’s even better?

Needless to say, Yang Ye was quite tempted. He’d personally witnessed how formidable the ice casket was, but she’d actually said that the compensation she was willing to give him was even better. So, didn’t that mean that the treasure was comparable to the Sword Precursor? After all, the ice casket was only slightly inferior to the Sword Precursor!

A treasure that surpasses the known ranks of quality! Yang Ye was really tempted.

However, the formation was too terrifying!

Yang Ye thought for a long time, and then he shook his head in the end. While the treasure was great, he needed to be alive to enjoy it. The formation was clearly left behind by an extraordinary expert, and based on his current strength, even two overlapped Heavenrends may not be able to destroy it. Most importantly, the formation extended throughout the surroundings. So, once he attacked, the entire formation would be activated.

Suddenly, the hand released Yang Ye’s shoulder.

Yang Ye heaved a sigh of relief because she seemed to have given up. Suddenly, a pearl appeared in front of him, and then Yang Ye hadn’t even been able to see it clearly before the tiny vortex within him spun and instantly sucked it into the Primordial Pagoda.

Yang Ye was stunned.

Yang Ye immersed his consciousness into his body. He’d just entered the Primordial Pagoda when he saw Little Sky, and the pearl was floating in front of her.

Yang Ye glanced at Little Sky who was carefully observing the pearl, and then his gaze descended onto it. The pearl was only fist-sized, and pure white energy was flowing on it. It seemed like a Luminescent Pearl of the mortal world, and based on its outer appearance, there was nothing special about it.

However, even the Primordial Pagoda hadn’t hesitated to seize it, so could it be ordinary?

Yang Ye asked, “What is that?”

“A Spirit Pearl!” She gazed at Yang Ye, “Where did you get it? It’s an absolute treasure.”

Yang Ye hurriedly asked, “It is? What can it do?”

Little Sky asked, “You’ve heard of spirit veins, right?”

Yang Ye nodded, “Of course.”

She asked another question, “Then do you know what’s the best spirit vein?”

“Divine Grade spirit veins?” asked Yang Ye. That was the best spirit vein he knew of.

She shook her head, “No, it’s the Spirit Pearl.”

Yang Ye was astounded, “That’s a spirit vein?”

She nodded, “It isn’t an ordinary spirit vein, it’s a Spirit Pearl. Moreover, it isn’t an ordinary Spirit Pearl. I’ve taken a look at it, and it possesses spirit energy equivalent to the spirit energy within an entire large world....”

“An entire large world?” Yang Ye suddenly interrupted her, “Are... are you joking? Such a small pearl possesses the spirit energy of an entire large world?”

She thought for a moment and added, “It might be even more!”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

Meanwhile, Little Sky continued, “Do you know how precious spirit energy is? Especially once you attain the Deity Realm. You’ll need a tremendous amount of spirit energy to complete an advancement, and it’s worse for the realms above the Deity Realm. Every single advancement requires the spirit energy of a few dozen worlds. That’s why everyone is fighting to seize worlds. Because the more worlds they have, the greater their chances are to succeed at an advancement in their cultivation.”

She gazed at Yang Ye and continued, “Now that you have this pearl, you don’t have to worry about spirit energy for a very, very long time.”

Spirit energy.... Yang Ye was rather disappointed. He didn’t really care about spirit energy, and he cared more about things like the Sword Precursor and ice casket that could improve his strength.

Little Sky seemed to know what Yang Ye was thinking and added, “You know... even the combined value of that sword of yours and the casket can’t compare to this pearl.”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Why?”

Little Sky grinned, “You have no idea how much spirit energy you’ll need. In the future, spirit energy will be your foundation, it’ll be your life.”

Yang Ye replied, “Isn’t there a lot of spirit energy?”

“There is!” Little Sky’s face suddenly dimmed down, “But no matter how much there is, it can’t endure being madly seized by the humans and other races. Your human race and all the other races only know how to take.... Once this world is empty, you go to the next world. Moreover, spirit energy isn’t endless, and the day will come when it vanishes.”

She gazed at Yang Ye and said, “Have you seen what happens to worlds without spirit energy?”

Yang Ye glanced at her and asked, “Didn’t you lose your memories?”

She nodded, “But there are many things that just suddenly appear in my mind.”

Yang Ye felt speechless.

“A world without spirit energy is like a desert. It’s very desolate and sad....” She spoke softly, “The present enjoys, and the future suffers!”

Yang Ye glanced at her. This little girl seems to pity the state of the universe.

Meanwhile, she pushed the pearl to Yang Ye and said, “Take good care of it. It’s your fortune. This pearl doesn’t just possess spirit energy, and it has many other uses. You’ll slowly discover them in the future.”

As soon as she finished speaking, she turned around, placed her hands behind her back, and floated off into the distance.

Suddenly, Yang Ye vanished on the spot.

Yang Ye opened his eyes in the outside world because the woman’s hand had descended onto his shoulder again. Moreover, she’d pushed him lightly. Obviously, she was telling him to hurry up and save them.

Yang Ye’s face became quite unsightly because he noticed that he was actually unable to withdraw the pearl from within the Primordial Pagoda. The Primordial Pagoda was afraid that he would return it to her!

So, he had a problem now.

The Primordial Pagoda had taken the pearl, yet he had to do the saving....
