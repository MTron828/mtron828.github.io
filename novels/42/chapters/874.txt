Chapter 875 – Be The Sect Master?

Yang Ye had an unprecedentedly solemn expression on his face!

Because it had only taken the old man a single glance to see through all his secrets except the Primordial Pagoda!

He’s above the Saint Realm!That old man is definitely above the Saint Realm!

Yang Ye suppressed the shock in his heart and spoke solemnly, “Senior, you’re the founding ancestor of the Dao Order?”

The old man replied, “Your disposition isn’t bad. You are still able to stay so calm and composed when I’ve exposed all your secrets. It’s rare, truly rare. Unfortunately, it really is such a pity!”

When he spoke up to this point, the old man suddenly stood up and said, “While you’re an enemy of my Dao Order, it’s destiny that brought us together here. So, how about we do this? If you pass this test, then I’ll bestow fortune upon you; but if you fail, then you’ll stay here forever. Otherwise, my Dao Order will definitely be destroyed at your hands!”

“Senior, aren’t you afraid that my Ancient Sword School would take revenge?” Yang Ye was quite regretful now. If he knew that the Dao Order’s founding ancestor resided in the 5th test, then he would absolutely not enter this place. Even though the old man wasn’t the true body of the Dao Order’s founding ancestor and was only just a strand of will, it was absolutely not something which he could resist!

“Perhaps the Ancient Sword School might fight my Dao Order to the death if you were still alive! However....” The old man continued, “If you are dead, then trust me, they will absolutely not fight my Dao Order to the death. Because no matter how monstrous you were, you are still dead! A dead genius is completely worthless. Since you’re worthless, then how could they possibly fight my Dao Order to the death for your sake?”

Yang Ye fell silent because the old man was very right. If the old man killed him right now, then while the Ancient Sword School might attack, it would absolutely not fight the Dao Order to the death. Of course, it would be a completely different situation if he was alive. The Ancient Sword School couldn’t be blamed for that, and he could only blame himself for courting death.

Yang Ye pondered deeply for a short while and said, “Looks like I have no other choice?”

“You really have no choice!” The old man continued, “So, are you ready?”

Yang Ye nodded and said, “Come, let me see exactly what has been stopping the disciples of your Dao Order for tens of thousands of years.”

“It isn’t anything great, and it’s just a simple question. You have a single chance to answer it. Get it right, and you live; get it wrong, and you’ll die!” said the old man.

Yang Ye said, “Let’s begin then!”

The old man’s expression suddenly became serious as he said, “What’s the Dao?”

What’s the Dao? Yang Ye’s brows knit together, but it didn’t take long for them to relax. After that, he clenched his fist and waved it, “This is the Dao!”

“You’re quite confident!” The old man said, “Unfortunately, a fist isn’t the Dao! So, you’ve lost!”

Yang Ye said, “There are a myriad of Daos throughout the world, and every person has his own Dao. How can you say that my fist isn’t the Dao?”

The old man said, “Then tell me why your fist is the Dao?”

Yang Ye looked the old man in the eye and said, “One my fist is strong enough, then it’s the Dao if I say it is. It’s just that simple!”

The old man gazed at Yang Ye for a short while before he spoke, “But your fist doesn’t seem to be strong enough!”

Yang Ye replied, “It’ll grow stronger!”

The old man said, “What if others don’t let it get stronger?”

Yang Ye answered, “If the heavens stand in my way, then I’ll slaughter the heavens. If the earth stands in my way, then I’ll split the earth. If men stand in my way, then I’ll kill them all. If all things in the world stand in my way, then I’ll kill as I go until everything is destroyed! That is my Dao!”

The old man gazed at Yang Ye in silence for a very long time.

Meanwhile, the profound energy within Yang Ye started circulating, and he was ready to immediately react if the old man made the slightest movement. His goal wasn’t to kill the old man but to survive. Because the Saint Realm experts of the Ancient Sword School were definitely outside, and so long as he could survive for a few breaths of time, then it was very likely for him to survive. After all, the old man was only a strand of will, and it wasn’t the Dao Order’s Founding Ancestor’s real body!

A long time passed before the old man spoke again, “Your disposition really is suitable to cultivate in the sword.”

Yang Ye said, “Senior, you acknowledge my Dao?”

The old man shook his head and said. “In the end, the Dao of slaughter isn’t the right way. As the greater your intent to kill is, the more consumed you will be, and that would make it more and more difficult for you to break through into the Saint Realm in the future. Moreover, it won’t just stop at the Saint Realm, every single advancement you make will be many times more difficult than others.”

Yang Ye said, “Then you’re prepared to kill me?”

The old man shook his head again and said, “Even though the Dao of slaughter isn’t the right way, it’s still a Dao. But it’s only your Dao. Since it’s a Dao, then you’ve naturally passed this test. Don’t worry, I won’t go back on my word.”

When he spoke up to this point, the old man suddenly looked up towards the sky and said, “I have 2 inheritances to pass down. The 1st is called the Nine Rebirth Technique. Just as its name implies, it’s equivalent to experiencing death 9 times. Of course it isn’t true death, and it’s actually the process of destroying one’s cultivation and regaining it.”

“Destroying and regaining one’s cultivation?” Yang Ye had immediately decided not to cultivate the technique when he heard this. Because he really didn’t want to relive the days where he was weak.

The old man nodded and asked abruptly, “Do you know why I left those 5 tests behind?”

Yang Ye said, “To choose outstanding geniuses for the Dao Order!” CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

The old man shook his head while a glimmer of recollection could be seen in his eyes, “When I was young, I wanted to change my fate, but I was rejected by all the sects of that time because of my natural talent. I was naturally unwilling to accept that, so from that moment onward, I exhausted all my time on cultivating, and I was much more hardworking than any other. If there were no resources to cultivate, then I would hunt demon beasts to earn it on my own. If I had no cultivation techniques, I created my own. If I had no combat techniques, I created my own as well.”

When he spoke up to this point, the old man grinned, “20 years later, not a single one of the extraordinary geniuses of those sects who rejected me were a match for me. I left those tests behind to give those without natural talent a chance. Because as far as I’m concerned, one can lack natural talent, but one can absolutely not lack willpower and tenacity.”

Yang Ye said, “What do you want to tell me from all of that?”

The old man gazed at Yang Ye and said, “You have willpower, tenacity, and natural talent. Moreover, you’re ruthless and decisive. If you live, then my Dao Order will definitely be destroyed at your hands!”

Yang Ye’s eyelids twitched, and he said, “Senior, you’ve spoken so much just to find an excuse to kill me?”

“I wouldn’t go so low!” The old man continued, “Allow me to return the topic to where it was. The Nine Rebirth Technique is a technique I created all those years ago. While it’s extremely dangerous to discard your cultivation and cultivate it once more, the gains you obtain would be enormous. Because every single time you cultivate again will transform your body and soul.”

Yang Ye asked, “Exactly what benefits does it provide?”

The old man grinned, “If you discard your cultivation and cultivate once more for the 1st time, your body and soul will be at least 5 times stronger than before. The 2nd time will improve your body and soul by 10 times. Moreover, you’ll obtain an undying body!”

“An undying body?” Yang Ye’s eyes twitched slightly, Isn’t that what Qin Bufan and the others had?

The old man continued, “Of course, it’s not a truly undying body, and no one can truly be immortal as well. The undying body I’m talking about is one where you can reconstruct your body if your soul still remains while your body has been destroyed. Conversely, if your body remains but your soul is destroyed, you can use your body to reconstruct your soul as well!”

Yang Ye was visibly moved. After all, it was extremely terrifying.

Yang Ye asked, “What about the 3rd time?”

The old man said, “Both the body and soul will be 20 times stronger, and your soul would be able to leave your body and travel the world!”

Yang Ye asked another question, “The 4th?”

The old man said, “Both the body and soul would be improved by 40 times. Moreover, you’ll break through the shackles of your body and merge into one with the world. You’ll be part of the heavens and the earth, so you’ll remain eternal while the heavens and the earth exist.”

Yang Ye spoke solemnly, “Isn’t that eternal life?”

“Eternal life?” The old man shook his head, “You must realize that there’s an end to everything in this world, even the world itself!”

Yang Ye asked, “What about the 5th?”

“The body and soul will break free of the shackles of the world and be capable of moving through the void. While the world might be destroyed, you will still remain eternal!” The old man continued, “However, I’m not sure if it’ll be like that!”

Yang Ye frowned, “What do you mean?”

The old man replied, “Because I’ve only done it 4 times!”

Yang Ye’s face instantly froze, and a long time passed before he spoke, “Didn’t you say that you created this technique?”

The old man nodded in response, “Indeed. However, the 4th rebirth and above are only based on my deductions, and I haven’t had the chance to test it.”

Yang Ye asked, “Why didn’t you?”

The old man replied, “I face 2 problems. Firstly, my strength has already arrived at a certain extent, and I’m quite afraid of discarding it and starting once more. Because if my deductions were mistaken, then wouldn’t I be finished? Secondly, I have quite a few enemies while many others are targeting me as well. If I were to try and cultivate again, then I’m certain that I’ll die as soon as I discard my previous cultivation, and they will definitely not allow me to have the slightest chance at reincarnation!”

Yang Ye was speechless.

The old man continued, “You’d attained the Half-Saint Realm in the past. While you relied on external forces to attain it, it could actually be considered as the Half-Saint Realm because your foundation is truly too solid. However, you’re only at the Monarch Realm right now. In other words, if you start cultivating my Nine Rebirth Technique now, then your body and soul would improve by 5 times when you attain the Half-Saint Realm!”

The corners of Yang Ye’s eyes twitched slightly. It would be a lie if he said that he wasn’t tempted. After all, if he cultivated it now and recovered his strength at the Half-Saint Realm, then his body and soul would instantly become stronger by at least 5 times!

Yang Ye asked after a long time passed, “What’s the price that I have to pay?”

The old man said, “Why don’t you look at my other technique first? Don’t worry, it will absolutely not disappoint you. Moreover, it just happens to be suitable to you!”

“If I can’t accomplish your request, then looking at it would be completely useless. So, tell me what you want!” said Yang Ye.

The old man smiled, “Actually, it’s a good thing for you.”

Yang Ye said, “Please go on!”

The old man gazed at him and spoke seriously, “Be the next Sect Master of my Dao Order!”
