Chapter 2370 – Ordinary Sword!

The old man asked again, “You can see me?”

Yang Ye grinned, “Senior, are you joking?”

He gazed at Nanli Meng and said, “You can’t see him?”

Nanli Meng looked before Yang Ye, but it was empty there. She gazed at him and frowned. She felt a little unhappy. After all, she felt that Yang Ye was playing some sort of tricks. However, when she saw Snowy’s gaze, her expression finally changed.

Snowy’s gaze told her that there was someone there!

But she couldn’t see the person!

A Two World Realm expert like her couldn’t see the person!

Suddenly, the old man’s gaze descended onto Snowy, and then his eyes lit up, “Eh? Isn’t this a Sprite Progenitor? Hmm, not yet, but soon. Strange, truly strange. I actually encountered a Sprite Progenitor here. Tsk, tsk…”

Snowy blinked. While she was looking at the old man, her gaze frequently shot toward the small bamboo chest behind him.

Meanwhile, the old man gazed at Yang Ye, sized him up, and said, “Besides that sword sheath and the Eternal Energy Seed within you, there’s nothing to my liking that you possess. Right, this little fellow is very good. Are you willing to sell her?”

Yang Ye hurriedly shook his head.

What a joke! How could he possibly sell Snowy?

At the same time, he became slightly vigilant.

The old man was too mysterious.

The old man grinned and glanced at Yang Ye. He hesitated for a moment and said, “I have a few treasures that are perfect for you. Do you want to buy them?”

Yang Ye hadn’t even said anything when Snowy hurriedly nodded, and then she gazed at the old man so that he would hurry up and reveal them.

The old man glanced at Snowy and put down the bamboo chest. He withdrew a small sword from within it. It was just palm-sized, and completely pitch black. Based on its outward appearance, there was nothing special about it.

But Snowy’s eyes had lit up!

The old man said, “This sword is called the Myriad Law Sword. Don’t underestimate it for its size, it contains a myriad of Laws, including the Laws of the Heaven Dao from Eternal Dimension. As for its might, I’m not exaggerating when I say only two swords in these myriads of universes can compete with it.”

Yang Ye unconsciously asked, “Which two?”

The old man replied, “One is called Executor. Its strength reigns supreme over the ages, and even destiny fears it. Unfortunately, it had to… Sigh, its soul was shattered, and even its spirit was forcefully wiped out. Now, even I don’t know where it is, and I can only wonder how much its soul and spirit have recovered.”

Executor!

Yang Ye’s eyelids couldn’t help but twitch. Isn’t that the number one sword of the Eternal Dimension?

Yang Ye thought for a moment and asked, “What about the other sword?”

The old man glanced at Yang Ye and smiled, “Do you know what sword has been the strongest since the ancient times?”

Yang Ye shook his head.

The old man smiled, “The Ordinary Sword!”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Huh?”

The old man smiled, “No matter what sword it is, if its owner isn’t strong, it is just a sword; but if its owner is strong, then even an ordinary sword can kill emperors and annihilate gods!”

He couldn’t help but look back at this point, and he said, “That sword is already showing signs of becoming an Ordinary Sword.”

Yang Ye glanced behind the old man and asked, “What sword?”

The old man shook his head, “It’s nothing. Fellow Daoist, will you buy this sword?”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and asked, “What’s the price?”

The old man grinned, “You have three ways to obtain it. Firstly, that sheathe and Eternal Energy within you. Secondly, that little fellow of yours.” His gaze descended onto Snowy at this point.

Meanwhile, Snowy’s gaze was on the bamboo chest.

Yang Ye glanced at the old man and said, “What about the third?”

The old man withdrew his gaze and looked at Yang Ye, “The third is a strand of your soul.”

A strand of his soul!

Yang Ye shook his head and smiled, “Forget it.”

The old man sighed softly, “Fellow Daoist, allow me to be honest. Your soul really isn’t worth much. I’m being absolutely honest when I saw that this is quite a losing deal for me. However, out of consideration that you’re able to make a Sprite Progenitor willingly stay by your side, that’s the only reason I’m willing to make this bet. I’m being serious, I’m prepared to lose my investment.”

Yang Ye smiled and said, “As you said, the best sword in the world is an ordinary sword, and I think that makes a lot of sense. If a sword cultivator is strong, then even a branch can kill gods.”

The old man glanced at him and said, “The ordinary sword isn’t so easily accomplished. Even I can’t explain everything about it. However, since you refuse to buy it, I won’t force you.”

He put the sword back into the small bamboo chest.

Meanwhile, Snowy blinked while slowly clenching her paws.

The old man glanced at Nanli Meng who had a solemn expression on her face. He was about to move his gaze away when he suddenly glanced at the thick scroll in her grasp, “Interesting.”

He sized up Nanli Meng again, “She has quite great aspirations, and her path is very special too. It’s very interesting. Pass her a message from me. Don’t try to force anything, for forcing something is obsession, and obsession comes in shades of both good and bad. A single hindered thought may destroy everything.”

He was about to leave once he finished speaking. Suddenly, Snowy placed her paw on the small bamboo chest.

The old man gazed at Snowy, “What are you doing?”

Snowy blinked and cracked a smile. She patted the small bamboo chest, and then it instantly trembled as if something wanted to escape from it.

Snowy blinked swiftly a few times, and then spat out a mouthful of pure spirit energy. A short while later, it started trembling even more violently.

The old man’s expression changed, and he shot far backward. He gazed vigilantly at Snowy, “Little Fellow, what are you trying to do?”

Snowy blinked, pointed at it, and then pointed at herself.

She wanted the bamboo chest!

She wanted it!

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

The old man had a weird expression on his face, “It’s mine.”

Snowy glanced at it, pointed at the bamboo chest, and then pointed at herself and the old man. Obviously, she was telling the old man to let it choose!

“Choose my ass!” The old man jumped with rage, “Why don’t you take out your treasures and let them choose?”

The old man’s expression immediately changed drastically when he said that, and he was about to flee.

However, Snowy had hurriedly withdrawn the sword sheath and Primordial Axe of Creation. She placed them before the old man, and then pointed at the old man before pointing at herself. Obviously, she was telling them to choose.

Yang Ye really wanted to laugh. Isn’t that cheating?

Sure enough, both of them didn’t hesitate to choose Snowy. Snowy grinned, put them away, and then gazed at the old man to display that it was his turn.

The old man suddenly slapped himself on the forehead and spoke with dejection, “What a mistake! What a foolish mistake!”

Very few in the world knew what the old man’s Dao was, but those who’d come into contact with him knew that he attached great importance to fairness, very great importance indeed. When he made trades with people, it was a one for one exchange. Even if he had the strength to take it by force, he wouldn’t if the other party was unwilling.

Fairness!

Because of what he’d said, Snowy had very “fairly” withdrawn her treasures, and they’d chosen her. Now, it was his turn. Actually, nothing would have happened if he’d immediately left once Snowy touched the bamboo chest. But he hadn’t, and that was what he regretted the most.

Leave now?

It was too late!

Snowy stared at the old man, causing a chill to run down his spine. Actually, he’d been very vigilant against Snowy, and so he’d isolated everything within the bamboo chest from being able to sense her. However, once she touched it, all of that was useless.

The old man was very conflicted, extremely conflicted. Reveal his treasures? He knew what the outcome would be. A Sprite Progenitor was too attractive!

But if he didn’t reveal them, it would go against his heart. After all, Snowy had done so “fairly”.

A short while later, the old man sighed, “Fairness. I think everything in this world should follow that. The world would be at peace if both the strong and the weak followed it.”

He withdrew a white jade bottle and an earthen yellow scroll from the bamboo chest.

As soon as they appeared, they flew over to Snowy, and Snowy grabbed them in her arms while cracking a smile. But just a short while later, she restrained her smile and placed them within the Primordial Pagoda. After that, she gazed at the bamboo chest behind the old man.

When he saw this, Yang Ye knew that the bamboo chest was the true treasure!

The old man’s lips twitched when he noticed Snowy’s gaze. He shook his head and gazed at Yang Ye, “Within that bottle is Divine Dew. Actually, it’s the blood and soul of an expert. Let me put it like this, if you allow that sword and saber of slaughter within you to absorb it, their quality will instantly rise a level higher. However, the blood of a god is too strong, so if it enters that sword of slaughter, its spirit will be eliminated. So, decide for yourself. Besides that, it has many other uses. For example, it can improve your body. His blood is much, much better than the blood of a True Dragon. No matter how strong you grow, that blood will still be an absolute treasure to you for the next ten years.”

He paused for a moment and continued, “As for that scroll, it’s called the Myriad World Diagram. An almighty expert once condensed a myriad of worlds within it. Actually, it’s just a map. But it’s no ordinary map. In any case, no matter where you wish to go, you go get there with a swish by using it. Of course, it’s best if you don’t go to some places. Besides that, it has another function, and it’s World Locking. When you engage someone in battle and don’t want that person to escape, you can use this diagram to lock the person within your diagram. It’s more than enough to trap a Four World Realm expert. Of course, the precondition is that you can defeat such an expert.”Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

He sighed softly at this point, “I’ve really made a huge loss today!”

He turned around and walked away. Suddenly, Snowy obstructed his path, pointed at herself, and pointed at the small bamboo chest.

The bamboo chest was trembling incessantly behind the old man.

The old man stomped his right foot down, “Seriously! Why did I have to encounter a bandit like you! Ugh!”

He patted the bamboo chest, and then two green fruits appeared before Snowy, “Here! Take it! It’s free! My Lord, you’re my great lord. Stop tempting those little fellows. See you again! No, I hope we never see each other again!”

The old man vanished into thin air.
