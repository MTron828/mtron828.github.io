Chapter 2497 – Come!

Yang Ye and the others were stunned by this.

What the heck?

We were nice enough to help, but this is how they are treating us?

Xue Yiren was about to speak when Yang Ye suddenly walked away. He gazed at the demon beasts and pointed at the three black robed men, “Attack them! If you don’t kill them, I’ll kill you!”

At this moment, Yang Ye’s temper had flared.

The demon beasts glanced at Yang Ye, and then the demon beast in the lead of their group suddenly asked, “You won’t interfere?”

They were very afraid of the Primal True Dragon!

Yang Ye replied, “I absolutely won’t.”

“Who do you think you are?” Suddenly, the black robed man spoke, “You…”

Yang Ye suddenly vanished on the spot.

Bang!

The black robed man was blasted over 1km away!

The others were stunned by this.

Yang Ye patted his palms together, “No matter why you acted in that way. We came to help. Perhaps it spoiled your own plans, but as far as I’m concerned, you shouldn’t have acted in that way… Forget it, I don’t want to waste my breath on you. Now, I can’t stand the sight of you, so don’t come looking for trouble. Otherwise, I’ll kill all of you!”

As he spoke, he gazed at Mo Ya and the others, “Let’s go.”

Yang Ye turned around and walked away.

Mo Ya and the others hesitated for a moment before following Yang Ye.

Only the two men remained on the spot with quite unsightly expressions on their faces. Attack? They naturally didn’t dare to do that. Yang Ye’s attack had struck fear in them. Moreover, there was a large group of demon beasts nearby!

Once they were sure that Yang Ye’s group had left, the demon beasts gazed at the two men. They were about to attack when a ray of white light flashed over from afar.

It was extremely fast and instantly arrived before the demon beasts. A moment later, a huge mirror appeared above them.

Rumble!

Countless beams of light rained down like a storm! In an instant, the demons were blasted backward repeatedly. But that wasn’t the end of it, a white shadow suddenly charged into the group of demon beasts.

Bang!

A white whip flashed through the demon beasts, and then one of them cracked open at the center!

Meanwhile, the remaining demon beasts were pushed backward repeatedly. However, a few more demon beasts were struck by the whip before they could even stop themselves.

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!

In an instant, a few of them exploded apart!

The leader of the demon beasts immediately led the others away and fled.

Once the demon beasts left, the white light dispersed to reveal a woman in a black and white robe. She glanced at the corpses in the surroundings, and then waved her right hand and put them away.

Meanwhile, a man went over to welcome her, “Ye Xuan, you’re here!”

The woman called Ye Xuan nodded slightly. She gazed at the black robed man who was lying on the ground and frowned, “What happened?”

The man replied, “You asked us to keep those demon beasts busy, so we did just that. However, four people suddenly arrived here. T-They wanted to take advantage of the situation and attack us, so we…”

A short while later, she looked up into the distance. But she couldn’t see anyone.

Ye Xuan’s face gradually turned cold, “Chase after them!”

Once she gave the order, her group went off in chase of Yang Ye’s group.

…

Yang Ye’s group was walking swiftly behind a mountain range.

Xue Yiren suddenly said, “I’m afraid trouble will be coming for us soon!”

Mo Ya nodded, “They aren’t ordinary. Sigh, we should just watch when we encounter something similar in the future. We were trying to be nice, but we met people like them…”

Lu Yunxian suddenly said, “They should be from one of the clans.”

Xue Yiren suddenly asked, “Why do you say so?”

Lu Yunxian replied indifferently, “They are arrogant and conceited. They don’t seem like disciples from any sects or independent cultivators. Normally, even people from normal clans wouldn’t lack intelligence to that extent. So, there’s only one explanation. They are from a large clan, and they innately feel a sense of superiority.”

Mo Ya suddenly smiled, “Brother Lu, if I’m not wrong, you’re from a clan too, right?”

Lu Yunxian nodded, “A small clan.”

Mo Ya smiled and didn’t ask more questions.

Meanwhile, Lu Yunxian suddenly gazed at Yang Ye, “Brother Ye, are you from the South Region’s Ye Clan?”

Yang Ye was quite surprised. He hadn’t expected Lu Yunxian to suddenly ask about that. As far as he was concerned, shouldn’t Lu Yunxian be trying to look for trouble with him? But it didn’t take long for Yang Ye to shake his head and smile because he was clearly underestimating Lu Yunxian.

Yang Ye was a person who would be nice if someone else was nice to him too. He smiled and replied, “Sort of! However, I’m just an illegitimate child of a branch family. So, to be precise, I can’t be considered to be a member of the Ye Clan.”

An illegitimate child!

Mo Ya and the others were quite surprised. They hadn’t expected Yang Ye to be an illegitimate child.

It wasn’t something to be proud of!

Meanwhile, Xue Yiren suddenly smiled, “Brother Ye, you possess such strength and natural talent, and coupled with the fact that you’ve entered the War Dimension now, I think the Ye Clan will definitely open its doors to you and allow you to join the main family.”

Yang Ye smiled, “That doesn’t make a difference. My own strength is what’s important!”

Xue Yiren smiled, “True.”

They sped up. They didn’t encounter any demon beasts on the way, but they didn’t dare to let down their guard. Especially Yang Ye, he kept having the feeling like they were being watched. He wanted to use the Sword Domain to investigate, but he discarded that idea after giving it a little more thought. Once he used the Sword Domain, and it was noticed, he would have some trouble to deal with. Needless to say, he had quite a few shackles on himself when he came to Eternal Kingdom!

However, it couldn’t be helped. Once his identity was exposed, he would definitely die no matter what!

The important matter at hand was to get Sword Scroll’s main body as soon as possible!

Suddenly, Yang Ye’s expression changed. He swiftly turned around, and a shadow had appeared behind him. A moment later, a ray of cold light swept toward his throat.

Yang Ye’s reaction was very quick. He dodged to the side by around 300m. However, the shadow followed closely behind him.

Yang Ye slammed a punch at it!

Bang!

A wave of powerful force rippled out of Yang Ye’s fist, and the shadow was blasted away. Yang Ye was about to follow up with another attack, but the shadow vanished as if it had never been there!

Yang Ye turned around, and he noticed that the others had encountered the same thing. All of them had unsightly expressions on their faces. Because they had suffered varying degrees of injuries. Especially Lu Yunxian who’d lost an arm!

If he’d been just a little slower, he wouldn’t have just lost an arm, he would have lost his head!

Yang Ye asked, “What were those?”

“I think they were Phantasmas!” Mo Ya spoke solemnly, “I didn’t expect them to exist here!”

“Phantasmas?” Yang Ye frowned slightly. It was the first time he was hearing about them.

Mo Ya nodded, “They are a type of spirit. Once some people lose their bodies, they choose to cultivate their souls. They focus on cultivating the soul, and they are very mysterious. I’ve only heard of them before this. I never expected to see one for real!”

Mysterious!

Yang Ye nodded. They were quite mysterious indeed. If he hadn’t reacted quickly and possessed keen combat instincts, he would have suffered an injury too!

Lu Yunxian suddenly asked, “Was that a test?”

Xue Yiren nodded, “It should be. They won’t let us get through this battlefield that easily, so be careful!”

Yang Ye gazed in the direction of the city, and he was losing his patience as he felt that he was wasting time here.

It was too slow!

As if he’d noticed what Yang Ye was thinking, Xue Yiren suddenly smiled, “Brother Ye, if you’re confident, you can go on ahead. We can get there ourselves.”

As far as they were concerned, Yang Ye was quite mysterious, or it should be said that he’d concealed his true strength. After all, Yang Ye still hadn’t used a sword!

Yang Ye glanced at them, thought for a moment, and then shook his head and smiled, “Let’s go together!”

If he were to be frank, they would probably barely make it to the city without him. It wasn’t that he was looking down on them, but this place really wasn’t a place that just anyone could survive in.

Those Phantasma from before were absolutely elusive, and at the Four World Realm! Earlier, the other Phantasma had only retreated because he’d repulsed the Phantasma which attacked him. According to his inference, that Phantasma may have sensed his strength!

At their level of cultivation, they could sense when someone or something was dangerous!

Xue Yiren and the others didn’t say a word when they heard Yang Ye. It was perfect for them if Yang Ye stayed because they felt safer with him around!

They continued forward!

But they didn’t travel for long before the sound of space being torn open resounded from behind them.

They stopped and looked back, and they saw four figures charging at them!Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

The group was led by a woman in a black and white dress! It was Ye Xuan!

Yang Ye frowned when he saw them because they felt hostile to him!

It didn’t take long for them to arrive before Yang Ye’s group, and then Ye Xuan glanced at them and asked, “Who?!”

The black robed man behind her stepped forward and pointed at Yang Ye, “Him!”

Ye Xuan’s gaze descended onto Yang Ye, and then she transformed into a ray of white light that shot forward. It was so fast and powerful that the space in the surroundings shook violently!

Bang!

An explosion resounded, and then Yang Ye was blasted over 300m away!

As soon as Yang Ye stopped himself, a huge mirror appeared above him, and then a ray of white light shot down and enveloped him!

Mo Ya and the others’ expressions changed drastically. They were about to attack when an explosion resounded, and then the mirror flew back to Ye Xuan’s grasp.

Ye Xuan frowned slightly!

Yang Ye leaped up from the hole in the ground and glanced at Ye Xuan, “Do you know why blood is red?”

She stretched out a finger and gestured at him, “Come here and tell me!”

Yang Ye waved his right hand at the sword on Xue Yiren’s waist, “Come!”

A sword howl resounded, and then Xue Yiren’s sword left its sheath and transformed into a ray of light that entered Yang Ye’s grasp!
