Chapter 2386 – Neverending Slaughter!

The dragon opened its eyes!

Bang!

A wave of terrifying Dragon Pressure swept out from within it and forced Mo Dao’zi’s group to a stop. Moreover, it felt extremely oppressive to them.

It was suffocating!

That was what they felt!

Along with the arrival of the Dragon Pressure, the Primal True Dragon’s figure instantly rose explosively in size. In an instant, a 3km long dragon soared through the sky.

It blotted out the sky!

The Primal Dragon could be said to have blotted out the sky!

All of them were stunned when they saw it!

A dragon!

A Primal True Dragon!

How many years had it been since such a demon had appeared in Eternal Border? It should be said that pure-blooded Primal True Dragons like this had only existed during the Primal Era.

But one had appeared before them now.

Yang Ye and Snowy were quite stunned too. They hadn’t expected it to actually be able to become so huge.

The Limitbreaker Realm!

The Primal True Dragon was only at the Limitbreaker Realm, but while its cultivation was low, it was also just considered a child among dragons!

The Primal True Dragon looked down at Mo Dao’zi and the others, and then it slapped its claw down at them.

Its claw seemed capable of obliterating everything before it!

It was truly terrifying!

Even space collapsed in its wake!

Mo Dao’zi and the others were horrified. They exchanged glances, and then resolve flashed within all of their eyes. At this moment, fleeing would only give Yang Ye a chance to hunt them down and kill them one by one!Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

At this moment, they had to join forces and fight to the death!

Rumble!

Five powerful auras surged up into the air and slammed against the dragon claw.

While they were One World Realm experts, their joint forces were still extremely powerful!

Bang!

Along with a rumbling explosion, the claw was pushed back. Meanwhile, two of the Primal True Dragon’s claws slammed down!

Besides that, Yang Ye had transformed into a ray of sword energy and vanished on the spot.

Their expressions changed drastically when they noticed that Yang Ye was attacking as well. They exchanged glances, and then they stretched out their palms and pressed them down. Along with that movement, a powerful wave of energy rippled out with them at its center. At the same time, Yang Ye arrived in front of them, and then he drew his sword and swung it.

Hiss!

A brilliant ray of sword energy slashed down!

The energy they emanated was instantly sliced into bits, and the two dragon claws descended.

Bang! Bang! Bang!

Explosions resounded, and they were blasted away.

At this moment, they had no further desire to fight back.

Flee!

The same thought simultaneously appeared in their minds, and they did exactly what they thought. They immediately deactivated the formation and planned to flee.

However, something appeared in Yang Ye’s grasp!

The Myriad World Diagram!

Yang Ye raised it before Snowy, and the latter cracked a smile and blew. A strand of pure spirit energy immediately surged into it, and then Yang Ye tossed it forward.

Bang!

The diagram expanded, and then an invisible barrier instantly covered the surroundings!

The surroundings had been locked down!

The space here had been sealed off by the Myriad World Diagram, and the seal was stronger than the formation from before. After all, it could be considered to be a Divine Treasure.

Mo Dao’zi and the others’ expressions became unsightly from the sight of this.

Yang Ye ignored them, and he just charged at the gray robed old man who was in fierce battle with Oxxy.

The old man’s expression changed drastically, and he swiftly turned around and slapped his palm forward.

The strength of two worlds!

The sword arrived!

Bang!

As soon as they collided, time seemed like it had been frozen!

They remained locked there for a moment, and then Yang Ye twisted his sword with both hands.

Hiss!

Yang Ye’s sword pierced straight through the old man’s palm while the latter flashed over 1km back to converge with Mo Dao’zi’s group.

The old man glanced at his palm, and then he glanced at Yang Ye while the fear in his eyes grew stronger!

Suddenly, Oxxy hurled the Primordial Axe of Creation at the old man.

Hiss!

It chopped through the air and everything before it!

The fear in the old man’s eyes grew even stronger, and a pitch black saber suddenly appeared in his grasp. He swung it forward.

Sword and axe collided.

Bam!

The saber in his grasp exploded apart, and his figure was pushed backward repeatedly. Suddenly, a ray of sword energy flashed. The old man’s expression changed drastically as he slammed his left hand forward.

Hiss!

A sword pierced through his palm and stabbed into his forehead.

The surroundings instantly fell silent!

Everyone gazed at Yang Ye who was standing before the old man.

The gray robed old man looked Yang Ye in the eyes, “Yang Ye, you really surprised me.”

Yang Ye pushed his sword forward slightly, “I want to know how many Guardians there are!”

The old man chuckled, “What? You plan to annihilate them all?”

Yang Ye grinned, “Of course. I refuse to believe that you Guardians will choose reconciliation and make peace with me, right?”

The old man replied, “I can tell you that there aren’t many of us. There are less than 20 Guardians, and most of us are at the Eternal River. However, after this incident, I’m certain they should be returning.”

He gazed at Snowy who was on Yang Ye’s shoulder and continued, “The Eternal Dimension doesn’t welcome our presence, but it welcomes her. Just that will cause you to have endless trouble. Even if you can escape this calamity, the Eternal Universe will come for her once they find out about her existence. You won’t be able to keep her safe!”

Snowy blinked and gazed at Yang Ye. Yang Ye smiled, “I’ll protect you. We’re invincible when we’re together!”

Invincible!

Snowy’s eyes lit up, and then she waved her paws while determination filled her eyes.

The old man in front of Yang Ye was about to speak when Yang Ye suddenly stabbed forward.

Hiss!

The old man’s head had a new hole in it!

The powerful sword energy within Yang Ye’s sword instantly obliterated the vitality within the old man, including the old man’s soul!

In just an instant, the gray robed old man ceased to exist!

Yang Ye pulled his sword out and gazed at the others. The five of them stared at Yang Ye as he walked toward them. He chuckled as he walked, “The Longevity Sect? Freedom Sect? Creation Sect? Immortality Sect? Don’t worry, you aren’t the first to die, and you absolutely won’t be the last.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye tapped his right foot down and soared up into the air like a bird, and then a ray of sword energy flew in a beautiful arc.

Oxxy suddenly charged at them with the Primordial Axe of Creation as well. As for the Primal True Dragon, it didn’t stand by idly either. Two dragon claws descended from above! It has given Snowy a bad impression earlier, so now it naturally had to strive harder!

Mo Dao’zi had a ferocious expression on his face, “Everyone, either he or we will die today. Even if we die, we must drag him down with us!”

He led the charge at Yang Ye once he finished speaking.

The others behind him charged at Yang Ye as well.

Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!

In an instant, powerful waves of energy rippled through the area, causing the space here to collapse inch by inch.

Meanwhile, outside the Myriad World Diagram, a woman gazed at that expanse of space in silence,

It was Nanli Meng. At this moment, that expanse of space was empty before her. She couldn’t see anything! It was because of the Myriad World Diagram!

While she couldn’t see anything, she knew that a battle was going on there!

Who would win?

Nanli Meng closed her eyes slowly. She knew that she would find out soon.

Bang!

Suddenly, ripples swept through the area, and it was like an earthquake.

The ripples grew stronger and stronger…

Boom!

Suddenly, a loud explosion resounded, and then the area was revealed before her. A short while later, she saw a familiar figure!

Yang Ye!

Only Yang Ye remained at the center of the area, and countless strands of black energy were converging in his palm!

Souls!

The Soul Devouring Technique!

Yang Ye had naturally not forgotten that move. He’d kill so many experts this time, so he naturally wouldn’t waste their souls!

While he was suppressing his cultivation now, they would come in handy one day!

A long time passed before Yang Ye opened his eyes slowly, and he gazed at Nanli Meng. The latter said, “You killed them?”

Yang Ye nodded, “I did!”

Nanli Meng asked, “What next?”

Yang Ye grinned, “What are you trying to say?”

She sighed softly, “It’s endless. Especially after you killed the Guardians. You’ve truly broken the unspoken rules of Eternal Border now!”

“Rules?” Yang Ye walked over to her and smiled, “The rule is that only they can kill me, but I cannot kill? If that’s the rules, what’s the point of them?”

Yang Ye turned around and walked away while he said, “I know this isn’t the end. But that’s fine. I’ll kill until it ends one day! There’s nothing that can’t be solved with a swing of the sword. If something like that does exist, then I’ll use two swings instead. If two fail, then three.”

Nanli Meng closed her eyes slowly and spoke softly, “Stopping killing with killing is neverending slaughter!”
