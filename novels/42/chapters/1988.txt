Chapter 1989 – I’ll Be There For You!

Qin Chuan was crippled!

Yang Ye frowned, “What happened?”

Yu Jing smiled bitterly, “That fellow went to look around the place after he recovered, and then he got into conflict with a woman. In the end, he was crippled! And then they asked for 100 immortal crystals to release him!”

100 immortal crystals!

Yang Ye’s frown grew deeper, “Take me there!” Yang Ye seemed to have thought of something at this point and added, “Does A’Man know?”

Yu Jing shook his head, “She’s in closed door cultivation! So we didn’t notify her. Should we?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “No! Come, let’s go have a look!”

Yu Jing led Yang Ye to a square. It wasn’t very large and just occupied an area of about 10km. There were around 10 arenas scattered in the square.

At this moment, many people were gathered here. Or it should be said that two groups were in confrontation. One of them was Mad Saber and the others, and Yang Ye didn’t recognize the other group. However, he saw a familiar figure amongst them!

It was Qin Chuan’s figure. At this moment, he was on his knees, and there was a black chain around his neck. Besides that, Yang Ye noticed that Qin Chuan’s arms were hanging on his shoulders. Obviously, their bones were shattered. Besides that, Qin Chuan wasn’t kneeling because he wanted to, his kneecaps had been shattered, so he couldn’t stand!

Yang Ye slowly closed his eyes.

Meanwhile, someone chuckled happily from afar, “Oh my! The leader is here?”

Yang Ye Looked up, and he saw a young man. The young man’s clothes were quite old and worn, and there were many deep scars on his head. Besides that, there was a fine short sword hanging by his waist.

“Leng Cang!” Yu Jing spoke solemnly by Yang Ye’s side, “He was an extremely famous fellow in Southern Qilin Mountain, and he joined the northern faction.”

Yang Ye ignored Leng Cang and just went over to Mad Saber’s group. All of them seemed visibly relieved when they saw Yang Ye, and they nodded slightly.

Mad Saber was about to speak when Yang Ye suddenly said, “I’m very disappointed!”

Mad Saber and the others were stunned.

Yang Ye slowly closed his eyes, “I’m really, really disappointed!” He pointed at Qin Chuan and continued, “See that? See how he is right now? All of you saw it, but as brothers, why haven’t you done anything? Why?” Yang Ye started shouting furiously as he finished speaking.

Mad Saber and the others remained silent.

Meanwhile, Yu Jing spoke softly, “It’s not that we didn’t want to, but Qin Chuan is still in their hands, so we dare not act rashly!”

Yang Ye nodded slightly, “Sorry!”

Mad Saber shook his head, “That isn’t necessary. We understand!”

Yang Ye turned to look at Leng Cang. There were around 70 people behind Leng Can, and all of them were top-rate experts! As for Yang Ye’s group, there were only around 20 plus here. As for the rest, they were still recuperating!

“You’re their leader?” Leng Cang sized up Yang Ye and shook his head, “So weak?”

Yang Ye ignored Leng Cang and gazed at Qin Chuan, “Can you speak?”

Qin Chuan looked up slowly, cracked a smile, and shook his head.

Yang Ye’s gaze instantly became icy cold. When Qin Chuan smiled, he noticed that Qin Chuan’s tongue was gone.

Leng Cang smiled, “He said something he shouldn’t have, so he lost his tongue! What about you? Will you say something you shouldn’t?”

“Why waste your breath on him?!” Suddenly, a woman by Leng Cang’s side stepped forward and said, “Tell him to hand over 100 immortal crystals to spare this piece of trash’s life!”

“100 immortal crystals?” Leng Cang shook his head, “No, it’s 300 now!” He looked Yang Ye in the eyes, “It was 100 earlier, but because you ignored me twice, it’s 300 now.”

Mad Saber and the others’ faces became gloomy when they heard this.

Yang Ye was about to speak when Yu Jing spoke softly, “The conflict arose because Qin Chuan glanced at her, and then she…”

Yang Ye shook his head, “I don’t need to know why it happened. Since I acknowledged him as a friend and brother, then even if he did something wrong, I’ll fucking do something wrong with him!”

Yang Ye turned around and said, “I gave all of you a chance. Since you refuse to do anything, then I’ll do it myself.”

A sword howl resounded abruptly, and then a ray of light flashed.

At the instant Yang Ye vanished, Leng Cang’s expression changed slightly, and he vanished on the spot as well.

Bang! Bang!

The space here shook violently, and the others here were pushed over 3km back by a way of aftershock!

The surroundings fell silent after the aftershock dispersed.

At this moment, Yang Ye and Leng Cang were less than 10m away from each other, and Yang Ye was holding Qin Chuan!

The expressions of everyone behind Leng Cang turned quite unsightly when they witnessed this.

Leng Cang was a See Dao Realm expert! However, in just one collision, he’d lost to someone who was just at the 3rd stage of the Enlightened Realm!

Leng Cang sized up Yang Ye, “I didn’t expect myself to have misjudged you. So you’re stronger than you look!”

Yang Ye gazed at Qin Chuan, remained silent for a moment, and then he passed Qin Chuan to Yu Jing before looking up at Leng Cang.

Meanwhile, Qin Chuan suddenly pointed at the woman.

Yang Ye gazed at her, and Yu Jing said, “She cut off Qin Chuan’s tongue!”

Yang Ye nodded slightly, “Don’t worry, she’ll suffer the same!” Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye gazed at Leng Cang. He didn’t say another word and just flashed over to Leng Cang. In an instant, afterimages of Yang Ye filled the surroundings.

Shadow Sword!

Leng Cang’s face had a solemn expression on it when Yang Ye’s figure vanished, and then he drew the short sword on his waist. He stomped his right foot against the ground and transformed into an absolutely fine ray of cold light that shot forward!

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!

The sound of space being sliced open resounded incessantly, and it was ear piercing!

Rays of light and afterimages were the only things that could be seen. Many couldn’t see Yang Ye and Leng Cang at all. After engaging Yang Ye in close quarter combat, Leng Cang grew increasingly shocked as the battle progressed. Yang Ye’s cultivation was much lower than his, but Yang Ye’s instinct in combat was too terrifying. Moreover, Yang Ye was extremely ruthless and was always willing to receive injuries in order to inflict them!

Bang!

Suddenly, Leng Cang created distance between him and Yang Ye. He held tightly to the short sword while his profound energy surged out madly, and the short sword slowly started to tremble.

Yang Ye remained indifferent. He raised his right hand, and a sword appeared above his palm and started spinning rapidly.

Three breaths of time later, both of them vanished simultaneously.

Crack!

The space in the surroundings cracked open. Meanwhile, a sword could be seen stuck in the left side of Leng Cang’s chest. As for the tip of the sword, it was stabbed into the ground. Just like that, Leng Cang was stuck to the ground.

The surroundings fell silent!

Leng Cang had lost!

The woman who’d cut off Qin Chuan’s tongue had turned pale, and her eyes were filled with disbelief.

Yang Ye walked over to Leng Cang. Suddenly, the woman and the others around her moved forward to surround Yang Ye, and Mad Saber’s group did the same.

Even though Yang Ye’s side had lesser people, they weren’t any less imposing.

Yang Ye ignored them and gazed at Leng Cang, “Do you know why I haven’t killed you?”

Leng Cang looked up at Yang Ye, “We men should resolve our grievances on our own! It has nothing to do with her!”

“I agree with the first half!” Yang Ye grinned, and then he vanished on the spot. It didn’t take long for him to return, and he was holding the woman!

Meanwhile, Leng Cang howled with fury and intended to attack, but Yang Ye’s foot descended on his chest and stomped him to the ground.

Yang Ye looked down at Leng Cang, “I haven’t killed you and her because I want him to do it himself. I think he really wants to do that!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye tossed the woman over to Qin Chuan. At the same time, he kicked Leng Cang over to Qin Chuan too, “Avenge yourself. It only feels the best when you do it yourself!”

Suddenly, Leng Cang howled with fury, “What are all of you still standing there for?”

As soon as he shouted, his subordinates intended to attack, but a ray of light flashed.

Hiss! Hiss!

The heads of two experts at the front of the group instantly flew up into the air and blood sprayed out like fountains.

Yang Ye glanced at them, “Why don’t you try?”

The surroundings became absolutely silent!

Everyone gazed at Yang Ye, and there was seriousness in their eyes, but it was mostly fear!

“Let it go!” Suddenly, a voice resounded, and then a middle aged man walked over slowly.

Yang Ye gazed at him, “The northern faction?”

The middle aged man nodded slightly, “Just let this matter go, alright?”

Yang Ye pointed at Qin Chuan, “Ask my brother if he agrees!”

The middle aged man glanced at Qin Chuan and said, “He’s still alive, but he may die if this continues. He won’t be the only one either. Everyone behind you might die too. It’s not a threat and just facts!”

“Facts?” Yang Ye chuckled. He gazed at Qin Chuan, “Do what you want. Don’t worry about anything. Even if the sky falls, I’ll be there for you!”
