Chapter 1446 – Talk!

What had he seen?

A huge mountain! A huge mountain that blotted out the sky was slamming down in his direction!

It felt like the sky was collapsing down upon him.

A wisp of ferocity flashed through his eyes, and then he transformed into a ray of light that shot up into the air.

Once he arrived in the sky, Yang Ye drew his sword and swung it!

Om!

A sword howl resounded as a ray of sword energy tore through the air, and it slammed against the mountain.

Hiss!

Bang!

The mountain collapsed apart once his sword energy shot into it, and countless pieces of rubble and dust erupted from it and shot through the sky.

A long time passed before the sky gradually returned to normal.

Meanwhile, a rock titan was standing in front of Yang Ye and Big Blackie.

The rock titan was huge, completely made of unknown faint silver rock, and it held a pair of rock axes.

Yang Ye had a solemn expression on his face because that mountain from before had been brought over by that fellow in front of him.

Yang Ye was very confident in his own strength, and destroying that mountain wasn’t difficult at all. However, if it was lifting and moving that mountain, then he might be able to give it a try once his physical strength was multiplied by three times at least.

I can’t use brute strength against it!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly noticed that the rock titan wasn’t looking at him, and it was looking at the Celestial Demon Wolf.

A moment of silence ensued before the rock titan suddenly spoke, “Death to intruders of Rock Mountain!”

As soon as it finished speaking, it raised its rock axe and swung it down at the demon wolf!

The rock axe was many times larger than Yang Ye, and it was extremely swift. Yang Ye merely saw a ray of white light flash before it arrived in front of Big Blackie.

Big Blackie was naturally unwilling to display any weakness, and it immediately slammed its claws against the ground and shot towards the rock axe.

Boom!

An explosion resounded, and then Big Blackie was actually pushed back to where it had been standing just moments ago. As for the rock axe, it had transformed into a ray of white light that flew back into the rock titan’s grasp!

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly. He was about to attack when the Celestial Demon Wolf beneath him shook its head to indicate that he shouldn’t attack for now. Big Blackie turned to look at the rock titan, and then numerous ripples swept towards the rock titan. A short while passed before the rock titan shook its head and gazed at Yang Ye, “Human, leave immediately or I’ll smash you into bits!”

Meanwhile, Big Blackie turned to look at Yang Ye, and then it started waving its claws.

A short while passed before Yang Ye understood what was going on. This was Rock Mountain. As for what Rock Mountain represented, he had no idea. In any case, this was Rock Mountain, and it was the territory of the rock titan. The rock titan had attacked them because they’d entered its territory.

But they had to pass through Rock Mountain to get to the Forest of Darkness. Of course, they could go around. However, it would consume a huge amount of time. Because Rock Mountain was huge. Even with the demon wolf’s speed, it would take at least around a day to go around Rock Mountain. Moreover, if they went around it, they may encounter even more danger.

So, Rock Mountain was their best choice. However, the rock titan was in their path.

Talk!

I have to talk with it!

Yang Ye thought for a moment and said, “We have no intention to offend you, and we just want to pass through. Please allow us passage. I promise we’re just passing through!”

Big Black hurriedly nodded as well to display that they were just passing through.

“No!” The rock titan’s voice was like a thunderclap as it pointed its axe at Yang Ye, “Human! Leave or die!”

Clearly, it refused to talk!

Yang Ye glanced at it, fell silent for a while, and then suddenly said, “Since you don’t welcome us, then farewell.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye patted Big Blackie, and the latter immediately turned around and left.

The rock titan withdrew its axe when it saw this. However, Big Blackie suddenly transformed into a ray of dark light that shot towards Rock Mountain. Big Blackie was extremely swift and had instantly passed by the rock titan and vanished into the distance.

Go around?

Yang Ye didn’t want to go around. He couldn’t see anything in this damnable place. If he tried to go around, then they might encounter some sort of monster. Moreover, he didn’t want to waste time. Since this was the fastest route, then why go around it? Even though the rock titan refused them passage, what could the rock titan do if they were fast?

The rock titan was extremely strong, and it could even push Big Blackie back, so it was obvious how terrifying its strength was. Thus, Yang Ye hadn’t chosen to go head-on against it. After all, he just wanted to pass through.

Big Blackie was swift indeed, and it had left the rock titan far behind in just an instant.

However, Yang Ye’s expression changed just a few moments later. Because a rock axe was rapidly approaching from behind them. The axe carried extremely terrifying force, and it had even locked onto them. So, it was impossible to avoid.

He could only go head-on against it!

Yang Ye turned around, drew his sword, and swung it.

Bang!

The rock axe was blasted away. However, Yang Ye was blasted flying by the impact as well, and he flew around 10km away!

Once he stopped himself, Yang Ye looked down at his hand, and he noticed that his palm had cracked open. Moreover, cracks had appeared throughout his arm.

What terrifying strength! Yang Ye took a deep breath and looked up. The ground not too far away from him was trembling, and then the head of a rock titan emerged from there. It didn’t take long for the rock titan to appear before Yang Ye and Big Blackie.

Yang Ye circulated his violet energy to repair his arm while he gazed at the rock titan, “Brother, we just want to pass through!”

“Human! Die!” As soon as it finished speaking, it swung its rock axe again, and the rock axe descended rapidly in Yang Ye and Big Blackie’s direction.

Yang Ye didn’t try to use his ability to locate flaws. Because the rock titan was too physically strong, he couldn’t overcome that strength at all!

Yang Ye stopped holding back and took a step forward before two types of terrifying intents appeared out of thin air. After that, the intents coiled together and swept towards the rock axe.

Bang!

The rock axe was instantly blasted away on collision. However, the intents hadn’t vanished, and they didn’t slow down at all as they slammed against the rock titan!

“Ha!” The rock titan shouted with fury, and it raised its other axe and swung it forward.

Bang!

Yang Ye’s intents shattered into bits, and the aftershock swept towards the rock titan. However, it merely took two steps back before it stopped moving.

Moreover, it was completely unharmed!

The corners of Yang Ye’s mouth twitched at the slight of this. That fellow’s defenses are even stronger than the Celestial Demon Hegemon Body.

Yang Ye had no way to fight the rock titan because he couldn’t pierce the fellow’s defenses. Unless he activated the Sword God’s Seal and raised his sword intent to the Returnal Rank, of course. Only then would it be possible for him to pierce through the rock titan’s defenses!

But what about after the battle? This was the Ominous Territory; it wasn’t Clouds of Heaven City. Anything here may pose a threat to his life!

Yang Ye fell silent for an instant, and then he gazed at the rock titan which was about to attack, “I think we can talk about it....”

Swish!

The reply Yang Ye got was a rock axe. It was spinning rapidly as it slammed down towards Yang Ye, and the space in its wake warped.

Even though the space in its wake was merely being warped, it was extremely terrifying. After all, that overlapped Heavenrend Yang Ye executed earlier hadn’t even been able to tear open the space here. So, it was obvious how strong the space here was!

Yang Ye naturally didn’t dare to act carelessly. He sheathed his sword while his profound energy circulated madly. At the same time, both his intents surged madly into the ancient sheath. Once the huge axe arrived around 3m away from him, Yang Ye swiftly drew his sword and swung it.

Om!

An ear piercing sword howl shot up into the air. Everywhere it passed, the miasma around it was pushed backwards like a receding tide.

Bang!

A loud explosion resounded at the point of collision, and then a terrifying wave of energy swept towards the surroundings. Yang Ye was pushed backwards repeatedly while the axe was blasted away towards the rock titan.

The rock titan stretched out its hand and grabbed the axe.

Bang!

A huge wave of force swept through its body, and it couldn’t help but move a few meters back!

But Yang Ye had been pushed around 300m back!

Yang Ye glanced at his arm. At this moment, his entire arm was numb, and it was like he’d lost all feeling in that arm.

That fellow was too terrifying!

It could be said that if the Celestial Demon Lord activated the Celestial Demon Hegemon Body and fought that rock titan, the Demon Lord would definitely lose to the rock titan!

Its defenses were formidable to a horrifying level.

It wasn’t just its defenses that were horrifying, even its strength was horrifying.

“Human! You deserve death!” Meanwhile, the rock titan raised its axe and swung it at Yang Ye.

Yang Ye’s eyelids twitched at the sight of this. The most terrifying part of the rock titan’s attacks weren’t the strength they carried but the fact that they could lock onto their target. Just like this very moment, it had locked onto Yang Ye’s aura, so he couldn’t avoid it at all. Because not only had it locked onto him, it was extremely swift as well.

Right when Yang Ye was about to attack when Big Blackie charged forward and slammed itself against the rock axe.

Boom!

The rock axe was blasted away, and Big Blackie was pushed backwards repeatedly.

Yang Ye didn’t just stand by idly. He flashed onto Big Blackie’s back and said, “Let’s go!”

Big Blackie immediately transformed into a ray of dark light that vanished into the distance.

Since they couldn’t win, they had to flee!

Yang Ye hadn’t forgotten what he’d told Zhuang Weiran. At this moment, he couldn’t defeat his opponent, so he had to flee.

Only an idiot would continue fighting the rock titan when it was impossible to win! After all, he was here for the Forest of Darkness! Of course, the main reason was that he had no way to defeat the rock titan.

Big Blackie rose its speed to its limits. However, Yang Ye could still sense the rock titan behind them. Even though the rock titan was huge, it was extremely quick.

However, when Big Blackie rose its speed to its limits, the gap between them and the rock titan was growing larger and larger.

This allowed Yang Ye to heave a sigh of relief. He really didn’t want to fight the rock titan, and he presumed that even Big Blackie didn’t want to. After all, even if they weren’t beaten to death, they would be exhausted to death in a battle with it!

A short while passed before Big Blackie suddenly stopped.

Yang Ye was stunned. It didn’t take long for him to look up into the distance, and then the corners of his mouth instantly twitched. After that, a droplet of cold sweat flowed down his forehead.

In an instant, Yang Ye gulped and said, “Big Blackie, let’s go back to that rock titan....”
