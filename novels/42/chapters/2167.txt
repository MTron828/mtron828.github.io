Chapter 2168 – Just Shut Up!

The atmosphere here instantly became tense!

Yang Ye had indifference all over his face.

Hand over Snowy?

They were dreaming!

Suddenly, the Sovereign of Sky wanted to say something, but Yang Ye spoke first. He gazed at the Weapon Progenitor, “Actually, I came here sincerely, but now it seems like some people aren’t sincere. Since that’s the case, we don’t have to talk further.”

He gazed at the Sovereign of Sky’s group, “If you want to fight, I’ll accompany you at any time!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he turned around and walked away!

The Sovereign of Sky and the others had quite unsightly expressions on their faces. Yang Ye was too arrogant!

Suddenly, the Weapon Progenitor spoke, “Young Brother, please wait a moment!”

Yang Ye stopped, gazed at the Weapon Progenitor and waited to hear what he had to say.

The Weapon Progenitor said, “If the Alliance of All attacks the human race, then do you think the human race can defend itself?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “Of course not!”

Surprise flashed through the Weapon Progenitor’s eyes, “Then…”

Yang Ye smiled, “If we can’t defend it, then we won’t! I’ll kill an equal amount to those they kill from my side. If the human race is annihilated, then I’ll annihilate them.”

Mutual destruction!

The Weapon Progenitor’s eyes narrowed slightly. He had quite the headache at this moment. This fellow before him was an utter madman. This fellow clearly dared to bring mutual destruction to both sides if the Alliance of All dared to attack him!

Not to mention the Alliance of All, even the Weapon Path was quite afraid!

If he was kept busy, then who would stop Yang Ye? No one could. Moreover, Yang Ye had another monstrous genius by his side! If there was someone in the younger generation who could stop Yang Ye, then it would be An Nanjing. However, An Nanjing was on Yang Ye’s side!

“You seem to be very confident in yourself!” Suddenly, the Sovereign of Sky said, “But have you thought about what would happen if we kill you first?”

“Kill me?” A smile curled up on Yang Ye’s face, “Allow me to be honest, I’m not just saying it because you’re standing here before me but all of you are really not enough! Especially you, Sovereign of Sky. Let me say this right here and now, let’s fight one on one, and I’ll let you do as you please to me if I can’t kill you in ten moves. Do you dare?”

The surroundings fell silent when he said that.

It was deathly silent!

Kill the Sovereign of Sky in ten moves!

Not a surprise attack but an actual one on one battle!

Had Yang Ye gone mad?

Suddenly, Yang Ye said, “I’ve changed my mind.”

Everyone here heaved slight sighs of relief in their hearts. Because it seemed like Yang Ye had realized his mistake.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly said, “Why would I need ten moves to kill you? Three is more than enough.”

Everyone here was speechless.

At this moment, the Sovereign of Sky’s face was extremely unsightly!

Could he step back from such provocation?

Of course not!

The Sovereign of Sky stepped forward and was about to speak, but the Weapon Progenitor shook his head. The Sovereign of Sky’s pupils constricted from the sight of this. The Weapon Progenitor was stopping him! What did that represent?

It represented that the Weapon Progenitor gelt Yang Ye could kill him in three moves!

Impossible!

The Sovereign of Sky’s eyes were filled with disbelief!

Yang Ye glanced at the Weapon Progenitor and said, “Senior, let me just say this one last time. Since they aren’t sincere, I’m leaving. Right, I have to ask, has the Weapon Path joined forces with the Alliance of All?”

The Weapon Progenitor shook his head slightly, “My Weapon Path will not interfere in these things, and I’m just doing this to try and help both of you make peace.”

While he didn’t fear Yang Ye, he didn’t want to offend Yang Ye. The Buddhist Path had suffered because of it, and he didn’t want the Weapon Path to follow in its footsteps.

Peace!

Yang Ye nodded, “But it seems like you’re bound to fail at that task.”

He glanced at the Sovereign of Sky’s group and continued, “If the Sovereign of Sky remains in command of the Alliance of All, then I can tell all of you that we don’t have to discuss anything. The Alliance of All isn’t afraid of my human race, and we are not afraid of you either. If you want to fight, we’ll be ready at any time.”

“Do you really plan to bring mutual destruction to us?” Suddenly, the Demon God spoke abruptly.

Yang Ye glanced at the Demon God, “My patience is limited. If you still want to speak about such meaningless things to me, then forgive me for being unwilling to stay and listen.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye turned around and walked away.

Suddenly, the Spirit God said, “We can forget the Sprite Lord!”

Yang Ye stopped and gazed at him, the latter said, “We can forget the matter of the Sprite Lord for now, and we can talk about it in the future. Now, let’s talk about something else, alright?”

Yang Ye said, “Go on!”

The Spirit God walked over to Yang Ye, “The End Times is here, and we need a way out. But it’s very difficult to find. However, according to my knowledge, the Sprite Lord may be able to help. After all, she receives the favor of all Sprites. We hope that she can help us find a way out. Once we have a way out, the enmity between our alliance and you would cease to exist!”

He paused for a moment and continued, “If you refuse, it’s equivalent to refusing us a way out of this. I’m not threatening you, but at that time, we have no other choice but to go to war with you and seize the Sprite Lord. This is the truth, and it’s our final option. However, we know you’re not ordinary, and you have the support of experts too. So, war will only lead to our mutual destruction. But we can only wait for death if we don’t go to war, and we’ll have a chance if we do!”

Yang Ye remained silent.

Because he knew that the Spirit God wasn’t wrong. Once they couldn’t find a way out, the Alliance of All would definitely target him and Snowy.

Once they were at a dead end, they couldn’t be stopped, even if Yang Ye had the support of three progenitors.

All of them just wanted to live!

The Spirit God added, “That’s what we wanted to discuss. You use the Sprite Lord to help us find a way out, and we’ll be absolutely grateful if you succeed!”

Actually, they wanted to get the Sprite Lord for themselves!

However, Yang Ye wasn’t a weakling! They’d tried before this, but not only had they failed, they’d lost so many experts as well. Even the Buddhist Path had chosen to temporarily retreat. At that moment, they knew that they had to use a different method, so they got the help of the Weapon Progenitor!

Yang Ye fell silent for a long time, and then he said, “So, all of you are trying to stick to me?”

The Spirit God replied, “You can think of it from another angle. You need to find a way out for the human race, right? Since you’re searching, then why not search for everyone? Isn’t it great if we can all escape the large universe?”

Find a way out!

Yang Ye glanced at the Spirit God and replied, “I can help, but I have conditions.”

“You want to raise conditions?” Meanwhile, the Sovereign of Sky suddenly spoke coldly, “You…”

What you?” Yang Ye suddenly gazed at the Sovereign of Sky, “Can you shut up? If you don’t, then let’s fight one on one!”

One on one!

An unsightly expression instantly appeared on the Sovereign of Sky’s face. He was about to speak when the Spirit God spoke first, “Tell us about your conditions!”

Yang Ye gazed at the Spirit God, “It’s very simple. Firstly, I need immortal crystals. Not much, just three million!”

“Three million! The Sovereign of Sky spoke angrily, “Yang Ye, you…”

Suddenly, a ray of light flashed.

Bang!

The Sovereign of Sky was blasted over 10km away, and a third of his body on the right flew away. Blood sprayed while internal organs almost splattered all over the ground!

However, he was still alive because he’d prevented it from hitting any vital parts of his body!

But the surroundings fell silent. The Weapon Progenitor glanced at Yang Ye and closed his eyes. As for the Spirit God and the others, their faces were extremely solemn.

One attack!

The Sovereign of Sky had almost been instantly killed!

Was Yang Ye a progenitor?

The atmosphere here became extremely heavy, or it should be described as oppressive. It was the oppressed of that attack!

As for the Sovereign of Sky, he was beyond shocked!

A single attack!

He hadn’t been able to resist Yang Ye’s attack! Or to be more precise, he’d almost been killed in an instant!

Terrifying!

That was what the Sovereign of Sky thought about it!

Yang Ye didn’t attack again. He glanced at the Sovereign of Sky and said, “I think you should just shut your mouth.”

He gazed at the Spirit God and continued, “Can we discuss my conditions now? Of course, if you think they aren’t acceptable, then there’s no need to discuss further. If you want to fight, or anything else, you can do as you please!”

Domineering!

He was just that domineering!

Needless to say, it made them extremely uncomfortable. Yang Ye and the human race were clearly the weaker side, but Yang Ye acted like he was on the stronger side!

The Spirit God suppressed the discomfort in his heart and said, “What do you want three million immortal crystals for?”

Yang Ye replied, “It’s very simple. You want the Sprite Lord’s help. Don’t you have to pay for it? Do you think she’s my pet, and she will do anything I say? She’s a lord, and you must pay immortal crystals for her to do anything. What? You look like you think I want those immortal crystals? Am I that kind of person?”

The Spirit God had a trace of doubt in his eyes. Obviously, he doubted Yang Ye.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye said, “The Sprite Lord is the Sprite Lord. How could she possibly help all of you for free? I…”

He suddenly stopped at this point. A short while later, he gazed at the Spirit God and the others, “I can’t do anything about this. She has changed her mind. She wants five million immortal crystals now, and she won’t help without them!” F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Everyone here and even Snowy was speechless.
