Chapter 969 – The Nether Pavilion!

Seng Yuan was slightly stunned as he hadn’t expected Yang Ye to have already advanced. However, it didn’t take long for rage to appear on his face, “So what if you are!? I’m a high rank Half-Saint!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Seng Yuan smashed his fist forward.

His fist was still traveling towards Yang Ye when a wave of force had arrived before Yang Ye, and it caused the space around Yang Ye to be instantly blasted into pieces. Numerous pitch black rifts appeared around Yang Ye and seemed to be on the verge of swallowing him up. However, Yang Ye’s sword intent obstructed all of them, so the area where Yang Ye sat wasn’t affected at all!

Meanwhile, Seng Yuan’s punch arrived!

Yang Ye didn’t draw his sword. He just smashed his fist forward as well!

A wisp of disdain immediately curled up onto the corners of Seng Yuan’s mouth when he saw Yang Ye launch a punch at him. A human is trying to compete with me in physical strength? He’s truly courting death!

Bang!

Their fists collided, and an explosion resounded as the space around them trembled violently and countless rifts swept towards the surroundings.

Seng Yuan took around 10 steps back but Yang Ye remained motionless on the spot!

Everyone here was stunned!

Seng Yuan himself was stunned. He’d never imagined that he would actually lose in a head-on collision with a human!

After all, it was a human!

Yang Ye took a deep breath, and then glanced at his own fist, “The Nine Rebirth Technique.... That geezer didn’t lie to me!”

After he attained the Half-Saint Realm, Yang Ye noticed that his body had actually undergone a very fine transformation, and it was a qualitative transformation. Simply speaking, he’d really become stronger, and it was exactly as the founding ancestor of the Dao Order had said. He was over 5 times stronger!

Now, his physical strength and defenses weren’t inferior to Seng Yuan at all!

Practicing the Nine Rebirth Technique doesn’t seem to be a bad idea.... Such a thought had appeared in Yang Ye’s mind when he sensed the strength he possessed. However, he quickly abandoned that thought. After all, he didn’t want to court death by discarding his cultivation and cultivating once more!

“AH!!!” Suddenly, a shrill cry resounded. Yang Ye looked towards its source and saw that the huge python’s tail had been chopped off by the 13 black clothed figures it was fighting, and it was fleeing in panic.

Yang Ye shook his head. Even if he’d attained the Half-Saint Realm right now, the 13 black clothed figures were so strong that he wasn’t confident in his ability to defeat them unless he utilized his Void Rank sword intent, the Divine Fist of Destruction, and the Sword Domain. Their joint forces were truly formidable, yet that python had tried to launch a surprise attack against them. As far as Yang Ye was concerned, that was like asking to be killed!

“How could your body have become so strong!?” Seng Yuan spoke abruptly. He’d experienced Yang Ye’s physical strength and defenses in the past. Even though they were formidable, there was quite a gap between Yang Ye and him. Yet now, Yang Ye’s physical strength had actually surpassed his. So, it made him feel extremely puzzled!

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts, gazed at Seng Yuan, and said, “Why don’t you guess?”

Seng Yuan’s eyes twitched a little, and he didn’t speak another word. He just stomped his right foot against the air, and his figure shot forward at extreme speeds like an arrow that had left the bowstring. His figure simply tore through space as it smashed towards Yang Ye!

Yang Ye flipped his right palm slightly, and the Herculean Sword appeared in his grasp. He took it in both hands before swinging a downward slash at Seng Yuan!

Bang!

A huge explosion resounded as Yang Ye took around 10 steps back. However, Seng Yuan was blasted down from the sky instead and crashed against the ground, causing a bottomless pit to be created there!

Yang Ye was about to follow up with another attack when Shang Yunxi suddenly spoke, “Kid, stop showing off. Quickly think of a way to make the Eye of the Heaven Dao leave. Otherwise, all of us are going to die!”

Yang Ye stopped and looked up towards the sky. He noticed that Shang Yunxi and the others were ghastly pale, and they were clearly exhausted.

He hesitated for a moment and said, “Senior, why don’t all of you just take Welkin Wolf Demon King and the others down with you? I’ll take good care of everything else in the academy, alright?”

Shang Yunxi was furious, “Kid, are you asking for a beating!?”

Yang Ye replied, “Will you really not consider it? It’s a rare opportunity!”

Shang Yunxi answered “Kid, I’ll make you deal with this tribulation yourself if you say another word!”

The corners of Yang Ye’s mouth twitched. He didn’t speak another bit of nonsense and just put the 13 black clothed figures away with a wave of his right hand. After that, he transformed into a ray of light that vanished into the horizon.

It didn’t take long for all the Saints here to be unable to sense Yang Ye.

Once his aura vanished, the Eye of the Heaven Dao started to stop as well, and it didn’t take long for it to start sweeping the entire area from high above.

Shang Yunxi, Welkin Wolf Demon King, and the others revealed extremely solemn expressions on their faces when they witnessed this scene. After all, if the Eye of the Heaven Dao still didn’t vanish, then they would truly be in trouble. Because even if they had the strength to do so, they still wouldn’t dare to destroy the Eye of the Heaven Dao. Because once they did, it would cause an even more terrifying existence to come for them.

At that time, they would truly have no chance to survive!

Fortunately, the Eye of the Heaven Dao scanned the surroundings for some time before slowly turning ethereal. At the same time, the dark clouds around it started to disperse as well.

Everyone here immediately heaved huge sighs of relief!

It didn’t take long for it to vanish completely, and the sun shined its rays upon the world again.

At this moment, both humans and demon beasts heaved sighs of relief.

This incident today was like truly experiencing death to them. The Eye of the Heaven Dao had been so terrifying that it truly aroused despair in them. It could be said that the arrival of the Eye of the Heaven Dao here had caused countless to feel reverence towards the heavens.

It was naturally not a good thing. Because regardless of whether it was the humans or the demons, starting to cultivate represented that they would have to fight for survival with the heavens. So while it wasn’t wrong to respect the heavens, how would they fight the heavens for survival if they feared it?

Shang Yunxi, Welkin Wolf Demon King, and all the other Saints frowned at the same time as well. Because they’d thought of that exact problem.

A long time passed before Shang Yunxi gazed at Welkin Wolf Demon King, “Welkin Wolf Demon King, I don’t care who’s pulling the strings from the shadows. I just want you to know that even if my academy won’t be able to stop all of you in the end, I’ll drag your mountain range down with us.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Shang Yunxi and the others from the academy vanished on the spot.

“You want to drag us down with you?” A wisp of a cold smile arose on the corners of Welkin Wolf Demon King’s lips, “Perhaps you could in the past. But now? Hmph!”

“That human, Yang Ye, must die!” Meanwhile, one of the Saints by Welkin Wolf Demon King’s side spoke abruptly, “His natural talent is extraordinary, and his strength is horrifying. Allowing him to live might create a potential calamity for our mountain range!”

Welkin Wolf Demon King’s face instantly turned gloomy when he heard the name ‘Yang Ye’. After all, Yang Ye had killed his wife and children, and Yang Ye had even robbed his entire treasury. Moreover, Yang Ye had even threatened him just now. It could be said that he truly hated Yang Ye to the bone!

Welkin Wolf Demon King took a deep breath, suppressed the surging killing intent in his heart, and said, “Have you determined his background yet?”

The Saint shook his head in response, “It seemed like he just appeared out of thin air in the human world. However, according to our inference, he should be from the Central Divine Territory. Moreover, based on his natural talent and strength, he’s from a clan or sect at the Platinum Rank at least. Per... perhaps he might even be from a Diamond Rank power!”

A Diamon Rank power! Welkin Wolf Demon King’s eyelids twitched. After all, this matter would be truly difficult to deal with if Yang Ye was from a Diamond Rank power. Because a Diamon Rank power wasn’t something that Welkin Wolf Mountain Range could go up against.

Welkin Wolf Demon King’s expression changed repeatedly, and a long time passed before he spoke fiercely, “I want him dead even if he’s from a Diamond Rank power!”

“Of course!” That Saint nodded, “So many children of our mountain range can’t have died for nothing. But unless we old fellows act against him, no other wolf throughout our mountain range is a match for his strength. Even Seng Yuan, one of the 5 Young Demon Kings, has lost to him. I’m afraid no one beneath the Saint Realm throughout the south is capable of killing him!”

Welkin Wolf Demon King suddenly asked, “Can Lou Qianxiao come?”

That Saint shook his head and answered, “I discussed the matter with Sky Divine Hall, but they refused. The reason for their refusal was that Lou Qianxiao is inheriting a mysterious Law!”

A Law! Welkin Wolf Demon King’s eyelids twitched slightly. He was a Saint who had transcended the limits of the world, and he’d transcended many Laws as well. However, it didn’t represent that all Laws were unable to pose a threat to him. Not to mention him, even experts above the Saint Realm were still vulnerable to some mysterious Laws!

“Even though Lou Qianxiao can’t come, Yang Ye will still die without a doubt!” That Saint suddenly added, “I’ve obtained news that the Nether Pavilion of the Central Divine Territory has sent one of their royalty. I just don’t know which one. In short, no matter which one comes, Yang Ye will definitely die. At that time, I’d like to see if Ocean of Clouds Academy would dare to step forward and protect Yang Ye!’

The Nether Pavilion! A wisp of dense fear flashed through Welkin Wolf Demon King’s eyes when he heard that name, and it seemed like he’d recalled an incident of the past.

A long time passed before Welkin Wolf Demon King said, “Tell Sky Divine Hall, the Python Clan, and the Steel Ape Clan that we don’t want to fight a drawn out battle. We’ll launch the decisive battle when that expert of the Nether Pavilion arrives, and I hope that they’ll give us their full help. Especially Sky Divine Hall. Tell them to stop trying to gain benefit while refusing to provide much help!”

As soon as he finished speaking, his figure vanished into the sky.

Ocean of Clouds City.

As soon as he returned to the city, Yang Ye shut himself within an A Rank cultivation room that the academy had built within the city.

Yang Ye sat cross-legged within the room while strands of violent aura surged out incessantly from him. These strands of aura pressed down upon the space around him and caused it to ripple incessantly.

Even though he’d advanced into the Half-Saint Realm, he’d done so in quite a rush. Moreover, he hadn’t had the time to consolidate his cultivation. So, his cultivation wasn’t very stable right now. Thus, he’d immediately hid within this room upon returning to the city and intended to consolidate his cultivation first!

Time trickled by, and the aura he emanated gradually calmed down.

After around 4 hours passed, the area around Yang Ye had finally become completely calm once more.

Yang Ye opened his eyes slowly and spoke softly, “It’s finally done!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he waved his right hand, and the scrolls which contained Death by a Thought and Stellar Ward appeared before him.

“Death by a Thought.... I wonder if it’s strength surpasses the Divine Fist of Destruction!”
