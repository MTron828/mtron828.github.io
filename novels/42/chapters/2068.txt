Chapter 2069 – The Reason!

Three swords!

The three swords shot through the web of lightning. In the beginning, they were extremely swift, but they slowed down upon coming into contact with the web of lightning. Even then, they were still moving forward.

Finally, they passed through the lightning and arrived in front of the woman. Meanwhile, the parasol in front of her suddenly shot forward and stopped Yang Ye’s swords.

Bang!

The swords and parasol shook violently, and time seemed like it had frozen at this moment.

Hiss!

A moment later, the swords pierced through the parasol and flashed forward!

Bang!

The parasol exploded apart, but at the same moment, countless bolts of violet lightning rained down upon Yang Ye like a storm.

Crackle!

Countless bolts of lightning surged through space like little snakes, and they were accompanied by fine rays of sword energy. Just like that, around 15 minutes passed before everything returned to normal.

At this moment, both Yang Ye and the woman were still here.

Yang Ye was in quite a sorry state. His clothes were scorched black, and there were many arcs of electricity flickering throughout his body. Every single flicker of it made Yang Ye’s body twitch slightly. As for the woman, she had two swords in her chest.

Judgment and the Sword Supreme!

She glanced at the swords in her chest, and then looked up at Yang Ye, “I underestimated you.”

Yang Ye closed his eyes slowly. At this moment, he felt extremely uncomfortable. While the electricity hadn’t pierced through his defenses, it caused his entire body to be numbed. If he didn’t have Primordial Violet Energy to ceaselessly repair his body, he would have been transformed into a corpse by now.

Meanwhile, she suddenly said, “You won’t be able to escape!”

Yang Ye opened his eyes, glanced at her, and then waved his right hand. The swords in her chest immediately flew back into his grasp. He put them away and left.

Meanwhile, the woman’s figure was gradually turning ethereal.

Right when she was about to vanish completely, a ray of golden light suddenly appeared in front of her, and then it enveloped her, causing the rate at which she was turning ethereal to immediately slow down.

She spoke softly, “Master, I failed!”

A voice resounded, “I underestimated him.”

She said, “I underestimated him too. His physical defense and recovery far surpassed my expectations.”

The voice said, “I’ve suppressed the vitality within you, so you’ll survive. Don’t interfere in this anymore. Just return to the academy and recover.”

“Master, why didn’t you act against him?” The woman spoke abruptly, “If you did, he would have definitely died, right?”

The voice replied, “If I did, it would change things. At our level of cultivation, there are many rules that we can ignore, but there are many that we have to uphold too. Otherwise, the world would fall into chaos. Simply speaking, if I killed him, then you and many of your junior brothers would probably not live to see the sun rise again tomorrow!”

She nodded slightly, “I understand!”

Meanwhile, the voice resounded, “Just recuperate. Someone else will deal with everything else!”

As soon as the voice finished speaking, the ball of golden light took the woman with it and returned to Martial Emperor City.

…

Yang Ye shot through space on his sword.

Back to the Weapon Path!

He was very well aware of the situation that he was in. Presently, he was definitely at the center of a huge vortex, and those people definitely weren’t targeting him just because he’d emerged safely from that mysterious ruin.

It was obvious from how Martial Emperor Academy had immediately driven him out of their territory. The academy was definitely not afraid of the Sage Alliance, and driving Yang Ye out was like a show of weakness to the Sage Alliance. But since they didn’t fear the Sage Alliance, they would definitely not show weakness to them. Thus, there definitely was another reason!

I’ll head back to the Weapon Path and ask Zhong Ye for answers! Yang Ye sped up. Based on his current speed, it would take him less than a day to return to the Weapon Path.

However, he was stopped right when he was about to enter the Weapon Dimension.

It was a middle aged man who obstructed his path, and the middle aged man was holding a huge sword. Yang Ye had never seen the man before!

Yang Ye asked, “May I know who you are?”

The middle aged man replied, “The Weapon Path’s guardian!”

The Weapon Path’s guardian!

Yang Ye frowned, “Do you need something?”

The middle aged man replied, “You can’t enter the Weapon Dimension.”

“Huh?” Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly, “Why?”

The middle aged man replied, “No reason. You just can’t.”

Yang Ye asked, “Where’s Zhong Ye?”

The middle aged man replied, “I don’t know!”

Yang Ye fell silent for a moment, What’s going on? Why is even the Weapon Path acting like this?

Meanwhile, the middle aged man spoke again, “Leave immediately!”

“Just go!” Suddenly, a voice resounded, and Yang Ye saw an old man walk slowly in his direction.

It was Elder Yuan.

Elder Yuan glanced at the middle aged man, and the latter cupped his fist and left.

Yang Ye said, “I don’t really understand what’s going on!”

Elder Yuan replied, “Of course you don’t. It’s a fight between those extraordinary experts, and you’re just a pawn to them.”

Yang Ye frowned slightly, “A pawn?”

Elder Yuan said, “Do you really think no one knows you’re from the Dao Path. Wouldn’t they be completely useless if they couldn’t figure that out?”

Yang Ye asked, “It’s just because I’m a successor of the Dao Path?”

Elder Yuan shook his head, “Of course not. There are many successors of the Dao Path. So, why don’t they target them instead of you? It’s because they think you have the Dao Path’s precious treasure. No, they don’t just think that, they are quite certain it’s with you!”

The Dao Path’s precious treasure!

The Primordial Pagoda!

At this moment, Yang Ye finally came to an understanding. So it was all because of the Primordial Pagoda.

Meanwhile, Elder Yuan added, “Those truly extraordinary experts hadn’t acted against you because the Dao Progenitor was still there, and you are the person he chose. So, they naturally wouldn’t dare to act against you while he was present. At the very least, those progenitors wouldn’t act against you. After all, existences at their level had to follow some rules. If they didn’t, it would only lead to both sides suffering heavy losses.”

Yang Ye asked, “Then why are they acting against me now?”

“Have they?” Elder Yuan replied with a question, “If they have, would you still be alive?”

Yang Ye fell silent.

Meanwhile, Elder Yuan added, “Even now, they haven’t acted against you themselves. But while they haven’t done so personally, it doesn’t represent that the people below them won’t. Moreover, those people usually kill others without the person even realizing anything.”

He gazed at Yang Ye and continued, “You’re surely wondering if you can go to the Dao Path, right?”

Yang Ye gazed at Elder Yuan, and the latter replied, “It’s best if you don’t.”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Why?”

Elder Yuan explained, “When you just arrived in the large universe, the four paths and some other mysterious powers hadn’t acted against you, and that’s because the Dao Progenitor was still present here. Yet now, he isn’t.”

“He isn’t?” Yang Ye frowned slightly, “He’s dead?”

“What are you talking about?” Elder Yuan derided, “How can someone at their level of cultivation die that easily. According to my knowledge, the Dao Progenitor is in closed door cultivation. I presume he’s aware that chaos is about to descend upon the world, so he has started to make some preparations!”

“Closed door cultivation!” Yang Ye’s frown deepened.

Elder Yuan continued, “You may not be welcome in the Dao Path if you go there after he entered into closed door cultivation. After all, he didn’t openly acknowledge you as his disciple. Moreover, you possess a precious treasure. So, if you go there, it may be the Dao Path’s own members who act against you first. Those fellows aren’t weak at all!”

Yang Ye cupped his fist to Elder Yuan and said, “Thank you for the answers.”

Elder Yuan smiled, “Don’t stay in the Weapon Path either. Zhong Ye is a good kid, and he isn’t to blame for this. Moreover, you have to thank him. You were only able to get here because he was helping you keep those Sages away.”

Yang Ye glanced at the entrance of the Weapon Dimension and chuckled.

Elder Yuan said, “The Weapon Path has no place for you because they don’t want to get swept into this. Otherwise, the Weapon Progenitor won’t have a moment of peace from now on. Of course, most importantly, you’re a member of the Dao Path. Just think about it, why would the Weapon Path do something that wouldn’t benefit them at all?”

Yang Ye smiled, “No matter what, thank you for the explanation. I must leave. Before I do that, can I ask you a question. Why do you know so much?”

Elder Yuan smiled, “With long life comes great knowledge. I know about things even if I don’t want to.”

Yang Ye sensibly avoided pursuing an answer when Elder Yuan didn’t give him one. As far as he was concerned, all that mattered was that Elder Yuan had no ill intent towards him.

It was his intuition which told him that the old man held no ill intent towards him. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Yang Ye looked up at the Weapon Dimension. In the past, he felt that he was partially a member of the Weapon Path, and he was even thinking about sharing the Inheritance Stone with the Weapon Path. He was someone who treated others as how they treated him.

As for now…

Yang Ye flipped his palm, and the crystalline and translucent Inheritance Stone appeared in his grasp. He passed it to Elder Yuan and said, “Please pass that to Zhong Ye. Tell him I don’t blame the Weapon Path or him for driving me away, nor do I have the right to blame him. All I can blame is my own lack of strength.”

Yang Ye turned around and left.

Elder Yuan suddenly asked, “Where do you plan to go?”

Yang Ye stopped and roared with laughter, “The world is huge! Home is everywhere! If the world wants my life, then I’ll put an end to the world!”
