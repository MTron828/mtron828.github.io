Chapter 1683 - Please!

Translator: InVader

Tired?

Rest?

Yang Jian and the others had extremely unsightly expressions on their faces. Is this a game? This is a battle of life and death!

Rest?

Yang Jian gazed at Yang Ye for a long time and nodded, “I underestimated how shameless you are. So sword cultivators play tricks too.”

Yang Ye withdrew two Energy Pearls and swallowed them before he gazed at Yang Jian, “Shameless? You’re using a whole group of people against me, yet you have the gall to say I’m shameless?” As he spoke, he raised his sword and started walking towards the 21 experts before him.

Yang Jian’s eyes narrowed slightly, “What? You’re done resting?”

Yang Ye didn’t speak. At this moment, those 21 experts had surrounded him. At the same time, a strand of mysterious energy had enveloped the area around him.

Yang Ye glanced at them, and then he closed his eyes slowly.

Yang Jian gazed at Yang Ye for a short while and said, “Kill!”

Swish!

An ear piercing sound of air being torn apart resounded, and then a spear arrived in front of Yang Ye. Right when it was just around 10cm away from Yang Ye’s forehead, Yang Ye twisted his wrist, and his sword stabbed forward like a venomous snake.

The sword just happened to strike the edge of the spear’s tip.

Clang!

An ear piercing sound of metal colliding resounded. The spear shook violently before cracking apart. As for the Zenith Realm expert who held the spear, he was pushed backwards repeatedly. Meanwhile, Yang Ye tapped his right foot down and pressed forward, instantly arriving before that Zenith Realm expert.

At the same time, another Zenith Realm expert had appeared behind Yang Ye!

But this time, Yang Ye didn’t pay any attention to the Zenith Realm expert behind him. Not only had he refused to stop and defend himself, he stomped his right foot down and transformed into a ray of light that shot forward.

The Sword of Rebirth!

The expression of the Zenith Realm expert in front of Yang Ye had changed drastically when he saw Yang Ye execute the Sword of Rebirth. After all, he wasn’t being supported by the strength of the others right now. Because that Zenith Realm expert behind Yang Ye was the one who had their combined strength!

Even though he wasn’t receiving the energy of the others, he remained calm in this dangerous situation. His profound energy surged madly, and then he used his palm as a blade and swung it at Yang Ye.

As for the Zenith Realm expert behind Yang Ye, he was clearly aware of Yang Ye’s intentions. So, he immediately sped up and instantly arrived behind Yang Ye with the intention of saving the other Zenith Realm expert.

Yang Ye still didn’t stop. In next to no time, his sword stabbed against the palm of the Zenith Realm expert before him.

Hiss!

As soon as they came into contact, the Zenith Realm expert’s expression changed drastically because Yang Ye’s sword had actually pierced through the center of his palm. But at this moment, the Zenith Realm expert behind Yang Ye was about to stab Yang Ye in the back. However, right when the spear was about to stab into Yang Ye’s back, a pitch black shield suddenly appeared behind him.

At the same time, Yang Ye stomped his right foot down and shot forward.

Hiss!

A ray of light flashed, and a head flew up into the air. Meanwhile, the Zenith Realm expert behind him had stabbed the shield on Yang Ye’s back.

Bang!

The powerful force carried within the spear blasted Yang Ye away. However, he’d merely flown less than 10m when Yang Ye forcefully stopped himself, and then he vanished on the spot. When his figure appeared once more, he was behind the Zenith Realm expert that had just stabbed him from behind.

Bang!

That expert had clearly taken precautions. As soon as Yang Ye appeared behind him, a powerful aura pushed Yang Ye back, and then that Zenith Realm expert turned around and stabbed his spear at Yang Ye.

Yang Ye obviously knew that this would happen. So, as his figure was pushed back, he turned around and swung his sword at the nearest Zenith Realm expert.

That Zenith Realm expert’s expression instantly changed. He hadn’t expected that Yang Ye would disregard the expert attacking from behind and attack him instead. Fortunately, the energy of the others suddenly surged into him. At the instant the energy surged into him, Yang Ye suddenly withdrew his sword and vanished on the spot.

When his figure appeared once more, he was behind the Zenith Realm expert who had been attacking from behind him.

Hiss!

A ray of light flashed, and a head flew up into the air.

Yang Jian’s face fell when he witnessed this.

After he killed a Zenith Realm expert in an instant, Yang Ye vanished once more.

Just like that, a few breaths of time passed, and another Zenith Realm expert lost his head. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

At this moment, Yang Ye was gradually gaining the upper hand. He’d found a way to deal with the formation.

He couldn’t defeat the joint forces of 21 experts. Their converged strength was the advantage of this formation, but it was the formation’s flaw as well. Because when one of them was filled with the energy of the others, the others would just be in a normal state!

At that moment, he wouldn’t have to go against the joint forces of all the experts here, and he could just kill the others. Of course, the precondition was that he was fast enough and strong enough that he could kill them in an instant!

It just so happened that he was fast enough and strong enough to kill them in an instant!

Just like that, in just 10 minutes of time, Yang Ye had killed almost half of them. Now, even if the rest joined forces, Yang Ye didn’t fear them at all and could fully suppress them.

Yang Jian fell silent for a long time, and then he suddenly vanished on the spot. At the same time, Lu Lige vanished on the spot as well.

A ray of snowy white saber energy flashed.

Bang!

An explosion resounded, and then Lu Lige was back to where he’d been standing just now. As for Yang Jian, he’d stopped on the spot.

Lu Lige chuckled, “Eldest Young Master, let’s spar a little!”

Yang Jian glanced at Lu Lige, “Alright, I’ll kill you first!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he vanished on the spot, and Lu Lige vanished on the spot as well.

They immediately became locked in battle. Lu Lige’s strength wasn’t bad, but there was a gap between him and Yang Jian. So, he’d immediately fallen into a disadvantage when the battle began. However, he was able to barely resist Yang Jian!

Delay!

As far as he was concerned, he didn’t have to kill or defeat Yang Jian. He just had to delay for a while and buy time for Yang Ye.

Bang!

Around 10 minutes later, an explosion resounded, and then Lu Lige was slapped over 3km away. As soon as he stopped himself, a wisp of blood seeped out from the corner of his mouth. Meanwhile, Yang Jian appeared before him again and slapped his palm at Lu Lige.

The space around Lu Lige instantly started trembling, and then a wave of powerful force blasted Lu Lige flying once more.

Yang Jian was about to attack again when his expression suddenly changed, and then he stopped. After that, he turned around and noticed that the battle in the distance had come to an end. Only a single person remained there, and it was Yang Ye.

There were 21 bloody heads beneath his feet.

However, Yang Ye wasn’t completely unharmed. There was a trace of scarlet red on the corner of his mouth.

He’d paid a price to kill all 21 of them, and that price was both internal and external injuries. However, as far as he was concerned, they were just minor. He had Primordial Violet Energy. Thus, so long as he wasn’t killed with a single attack or crippled in an instant, all injuries were minor to him.

Yang Jian gazed at Yang Ye for a long time and said, “I really underestimated you. I really did. Those above us severely underestimated you as well. I never expected you to be this strong.”

Yang Ye grinned, “Come, let me see how strong the eldest young master of the Yang Clan is.”

Om!

As soon as he finished speaking, he vanished on the spot, and a sword howl resounded.

Om!

At the same moment, Yang Jian’s figure vanished on the spot as well.

Bang!

An explosion resounded like a thunderclap. Space trembled violently while two figures split apart. But it only took a moment for them to charge at each other again.

In an instant, numerous energy palms and sword energy crisscrossed. The space here rippled and trembled before them, and it seemed like it would collapse at any moment.

Boom!

Space cracked apart amidst an explosion. At the same time, both of them moved backwards repeatedly. They moved almost 3km back before they finally stopped. A wisp of blood seeped out from the corner of Yang Jian’s mouth when he finally stopped himself, and it kept on flowing until it dyed the front of his chest red.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye had vanished on the spot, and a ray of sword energy instantly arrived before Yang Jian.

Yang Jian’s eyes narrowed slightly. He raised his arm and slapped his palm forward.

An energy palm suddenly flashed out from the space in front of him.

Bang!

The energy palm was instantly blasted apart. At the same time, Yang Jian was pushed another 1km back!

Pu!

As soon as he stopped himself, a mouthful of blood sprayed from Yang Jian.

Yang Jian wiped off the blood on the corners of his mouth, and then he looked up at Yang Ye, “I really underestimated you. I absolutely underestimated you.”

Yang Ye smiled and asked, “And?”

Yang Jian gazed at Yang Ye for a long time and replied, “I can’t kill you, but others will be coming.”

As soon as he finished speaking, a talisman appeared in his grasp, and then a beam of golden light enveloped him,

However, Yang Ye’s soul suddenly flashed out from his body, and then his soul vanished on the spot.

The soul version of the Sword of Rebirth!

The soul version of the Sword of Rebirth that was enhanced by two types of Zenith Rank intents!

Bang!

A ray of light flashed, and then the golden light around Yang Jian shattered. After that, Yang Jian’s eyes opened wide.

A gust of wind blew by, and Yang Jian’s head rolled off his neck.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye’s soul had returned to his body.

Yang Ye walked over to Yang Jian’s head.

Suddenly, a voice came from the sky, “All of us underestimated you.”

Yang Ye looked up at the sky and smiled, “I like it when you underestimate me. Because only then will I be able to kill to my heart’s content!”

As he spoke, he stretched out his tongue and licked the blood on the corner of his mouth. An evil smile curled up on his face as he said, “You know… I think I might get addicted to killing. Because I’m getting fond of the feeling of killing.”

As he spoke, he stomped open Yang Jian’s head and laughed ferociously, “Send more! I want to kill to my heart’s content! Please!”

As soon as he finished speaking, the blood vessels beneath Yang Ye’s skin started to wriggle slightly.
