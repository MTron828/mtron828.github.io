Chapter 1893 – Braised Snowy!

This sudden turn of events caused the surroundings to fall deathly silent.

Snowy’s eyes were opened wide and filled with disbelief. Obviously, she hadn’t expected that to happen.

Meanwhile, the old man hurriedly knelt down on the ground and kowtowed incessantly, “Immortal, she’s just a child. Please spare her. I’ll do anything you want to repay you…”

Yang Ye stared at the woman with a calm expression on his face. But those who knew Yang Ye knew that it was the moment he was the most terrifying.

As for Zhi’er, she fainted before she could even let out a shrill cry.

Suddenly, the women grabbed Zhi’er’s other arm and gazed at Yang Ye. She smiled, “Tsk tsk, it’s truly difficult to believe. They say you’re an extremely cruel fellow who kills decisively, but now it seems like you aren’t as I imagined. I’m disappointed, truly disappointed.”

As soon as she finished speaking, she pulled again.

Hiss!

Zhi’er’s other arm was pulled off.

Blood flowed from both her shoulders.

The old man suddenly stood up and howled furiously at the woman, “You… you have enmity with him, so seek vengeance from him. Why are you treating a little girl like that? Does bullying the weak bring you joy?”

“Of course!” She gazed at the old man and smiled, “Why do we cultivate? It’s to become strong! But why become strong? It’s naturally so that we can do as we please. Old man, see? I can do as I please now, yet you can only watch. That’s the difference between us. An ant will always be an ant and can only be trampled upon!”

She gazed at Yang Ye and continued, “Aren’t I right?”

Meanwhile, Snowy suddenly leaped up into the air from Yang Ye’s shoulder. A golden sword had appeared in her grasp. No, to be more precise, there were two swords. One in each of her claws.

At this moment, Snowy’s face was covered in anger, extreme rage. It was the first time that Snowy had ever been so furious.

“What a cute little fellow!” Meanwhile, the woman suddenly chuckled, “It would definitely taste really good if it’s stewed. No, it’ll be better if it’s braised!”

Braised Snowy!

Snowy was furious. She grabbed the swords and was about to charge at the woman, but Yang Ye stopped her.

Snowy gazed at Yang Ye, and then she passed the Sovereign of Man’s sword to Yang Ye while she kept the other. Obviously, she wanted Yang Ye to attack with her. Even though she’d only known Zhi’er for a short while, she had a very good impression of the little girl.

Yang Ye rubbed Snowy’s head lightly, and then he gazed at the woman, “You know… I always thought that the strong should have their own pride. To be honest, if you did as you pleased and tortured people who were stronger than you, then I would be convinced of it. However, just look at yourself. Besides torturing the weak, what else can you do? As far as I’m concerned, those who bully the weak but fear the strong are worse than dogs!”

She was about to speak when Yang Ye suddenly spread open his arms, “Come! Torture me! I beg you to torture me!”

She chuckled and tossed Zhi’er to the side, and then she started walking towards Yang Ye, “Looks like you’re very confident. You…”

Suddenly, Yang Ye vanished on the spot. He didn’t attack her, and he appeared beside Zhi’er instead. He took Zhi’er in his arms and pressed his palm on her chest. A short while passed before he heaved a sigh of relief.

Her vitality hadn’t dispersed completely. She could still be saved!

Yang Ye placed her within the Primordial Pagoda, and Snowy gave up on killing the woman as well. She hurriedly went into the Primordial Pagoda and brought Zhi’er to Hou Qing. She kept waving her little claws while a pleading expression filled her eyes.

Hou Qing glanced at Snowy and muttered to himself, Does this little fellow think I can do anything? She keeps seeking my help for everything…

Even though he’d muttered that to himself, he didn’t dare delay.

His gaze descended onto Zhi’er, and then he shook his head upon seeing her, “What a piece of trash! She caused such serious injuries to an ordinary person.”

Hou Qing was a powerful figure in the upper dimension too. Even though he was enemies with the human race, unless an ordinary person offended him, he wouldn’t torture and kill the ordinary humans for no reason. Because it was just as Yang Ye had mentioned earlier.

Pride!

The strong had their pride!

Meanwhile, Snowy waved her claws incessantly. Hou Qing hurriedly said, “Alright, alright my little lord. I’ll save her, I’ll do it right now…”

…

In the outside world.

The woman sized up Yang Ye and said, “So you said all of that just to save her. Tsk, tsk, what a surprise!”

Yang Ye ignored her and gazed at the old man, “Don’t worry, she’s very safe!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he gazed at the woman again, “Come!”

A ray of light shot up into the sky.

He didn’t choose to fight in the village because their battle would destroy it.

A smile curled up on the corners of the woman’s mouth, and then she vanished on the spot.

The old man looked up at the sky. However, he couldn’t see anything. He just looked at the sky and muttered, “The weak can only be trampled upon…”

High above in the sky.

As soon as Yang Ye stopped, the woman appeared before him. She was about to speak when Yang Ye suddenly turned around and swung his sword.

Heavenrend!

His Heavenrend wasn’t the same as it had been anymore. It carried obliterating force now.

Bang!

As soon as it descended, a huge explosion resounded, and then countless sparks and rays of light sprayed towards the surroundings.

A breath of time later.

The woman’s voice suddenly resounded, “Is that all you’ve got?”

Yang Ye looked ahead. A woman walked out from amidst the sparks and light, and it was the woman from before. Moreover, she was completely unharmed.

Yang Ye’s gaze paused momentarily on the red shoulderguards she wore. Those shoulderguards had defended her from his attack.

“Is that all you’ve got?” She suddenly chuckled, “To be honest, I’m very disappointed, extremely disappointed. Because when I accepted this mission, I thought it would be fun. But I didn’t expect you to be much weaker than I expected. It’s so boring…”

Suddenly, Yang Ye took a step forward.

The Sword Domain!

Once he released the Sword Domain, his aura was completely different.

An instant later, a ray of light flashed below his feet, and then he appeared in front of her while his sword and sword sheath had been switched for the Sovereign of Man’s sword.

The smile on the woman’s face immediately froze when he swung his sword. It was the same attack, but its strength was completely different.

She stopped underestimating Yang Ye, and her profound energy surged madly. At the same time, her shoulderguards suddenly emanated a fiery glow. However, because she’d been underestimating him, she was too close to him, so Yang Ye had been able to converge the full strength of his attack on her.

Bang!

An explosion resounded, and the woman was blasted away. Even the red shoulderguards were slashed into bits by Yang Ye’s attack!

Yang Ye didn’t stop, of course. Once he blasted her flying, a ray of light flashed beneath his feet, and he transformed into a ray of light that shot forward.

Her expression changed drastically when she saw him charge at her. She couldn’t be bothered about the injuries she’d suffered, and she just circulated her profound energy while forming a strange seal with both hands. In an instant, the space around her started to tremble violently, and then numerous rays of fiery light sprayed out from the space around her!

Flames!

Yang Ye was about to use his sword to destroy them with force, but he suddenly thought of something.

A moment later, a strand of flames swept out from Yang Ye. In an instant, Yang Ye was covered in flames, and then the woman watched with astonishment as her flames actually started to surge backwards and to the sides.

It was instinctively afraid!

Even though her flames were extraordinary, the gap between them and Yang Ye’s Divine Yin Flame was too huge. So, as soon as they saw the Divine Yin Flame, all of them immediately retreated instinctively!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye appeared in front of her, and then he swung his sword again.

It was just a simple swing of the sword. It had no flashy moves or special technique. It was just a simple swing!

An explosion resounded, and the woman was blasted away again. This time, blood constantly sprayed out of her mouth as she flew.

Yang Ye was about to attack again when she suddenly turned around and stomped her foot against the ground, and then her figure shot up towards the sky.

Flee!

Her trump card was those flames. However, she’d noticed to her shock that Yang Ye’s flames were much stronger than hers. So, she could be said to be completely countered by Yang Ye, and thus she’d decisively chosen to flee!

But would Yang Ye let her escape?

A ray of light flashed beneath Yang Ye’s feet, and then he appeared in front of her before swinging his sword again.

Bang!

She was blasted away once more.

At the same time, a mysterious wave of energy appeared here.

The Sword Domain!

Yang Ye had activated the Sword Domain again, and then a ray of light flashed.

A moment later, a sword was pressed against the woman’s forehead.

She’d lost!

She stared at him and was about to speak, but Yang Ye suddenly used his sword to slap her right cheek!

Slap!

A loud slap resounded, and a clear mark was left behind on her cheek.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye said, “That isn’t symmetrical…”

As he spoke, he slapped her left cheek with his sword.

Slap!
