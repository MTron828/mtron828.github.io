Chapter 1776 – I Can Fight A Few Experts Like You!

It was a woman. Yang Ye recognized her because it was the woman in a white dress who’d left just now.

However, she wasn’t wearing a white dress but a black dress. Moreover, her bearing wasn’t quite similar.

She gazed coldly at Yang Ye, “Who are you?”

Yang Ye glanced at her and said, “You’re not her!”

At this moment, Yang Ye noticed that this woman in a black dress and the woman in a white dress weren’t quite the same. Moreover, if they were the same person, then how could she not recognize him?

The woman frowned, “You know her!”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and said, “She brought me here and asked me to wait here for us!”

“She brought you here?” The woman in a black dress’s frown deepened, “Who are you? Why did she bring you in here?”

Yang Ye shrugged, “Why don’t you wait for her and ask her yourself?”

The woman sized up Yang Ye and said, “You’re that fellow, Yang Ye, who trespassed into my Secret Sect!”

Yang Ye slowly clenched his left fist.

Meanwhile she said, “I never expected her to collude with outsiders. How truly….”

Suddenly, her voice stopped abruptly while her expression changed. It was because a sword had arrived before her forehead, and it was absolutely fast.

Yang Ye had no intention to kill, and he merely wanted to restrain her. However, he’d underestimated her strength. She’d vanished on the spot when his sword was still a few inches away from her forehead. At the same time, a black lotus appeared in front of Yang Ye. A moment later, the black lotus exploded, and countless black petals enveloped Yang Ye!

However, it only took an instant for the black petals to vanish.

Yang Ye didn’t launch another attack because she’d created distance between them. So, restraining her with a single move was clearly impossible. But if he couldn’t accomplish that and entered into a battle with her, then the commotion created would be too alarming!

But the woman clearly refused to let the matter rest, and she was about to attack. However, Yang Ye suddenly withdrew the wooden sword, and she was instantly stunned upon laying eyes on it.

She stared at Yang Ye, “What’s it doing in your possession?”

Yang Ye spoke indifferently, “Just ask her when she gets back.”

The woman was quite displeased when Yang Ye refused to answer her, but she didn’t attack again. Obviously, it was because of the wooden sword.

So, they entered into a stalemate.

Meanwhile, Ying Qing and the others had extremely gloomy expressions on their faces as they stood there near a mountain range. It was because the members of the Secret Sect said that Yang Ye had left the Secret Sect.

They naturally didn’t believe it, and they wanted to go in and search, but the Secret Sect insisted on refusing their request!

So, the atmosphere here became tense again.

If they searched by force, it represented that they may enter into war with the Secret Sect!

Even though they didn’t know how strong the Secret Sect really was, the joint forces of their five clans didn’t have to fear it at all. However, the Secret Sect didn’t fear them either. After all, this was the Secret Sect’s territory!

A long moment of silence later, Ying Qing suddenly gazed at the black robed old man, “Since he has left, then we won’t bother you anymore. Farewell!”

Ying Qing led the others with him as he vanished on the spot.

One of the old men by the black robed old man’s side spoke solemnly, “They won’t give up!”

The black robed old man fell silent for a few breaths of time, and then he gazed at the woman in a white dress who stood by his side, “Yun Qian, is that sword really in Yang Ye’s possession?”

She nodded, “It is! Moreover, while it hasn’t acknowledged him as its master, it isn’t willing to leave his side.”

The black robed old man spoke in a low voice, “Come, let’s go meet him!”

He vanished with the others once he finished speaking.

Outside the Secret Sect.

Lu Yuntian spoke solemnly, “Brother Ying, Yang Ye possessed the Secret Sect’s teleportation formation, so there’s definitely a link between him and the Secret Sect. Moreover, he’s definitely still in there!”

Ying Qing nodded, “I know. But do you want us to fight the Secret Sect? Even though we don’t have to fear them, we gain nothing from fighting them. Moreover, our clans need time to rest and recuperate!”

Lu Yuntian asked, “Then what about Yang Ye?”

Ying Qing fell silent for a long time, and then he said, “Send some forces to watch the area outside the Secret Sect. He can’t stay there forever. Besides that, gather the resources of our clans and search for Yang Lianshuang and the survivors of the Yang Clan.”

Lu Yuntian spoke solemnly, “Are we really going to ignore Yang Ye?”

Ying Qing replied, “I’ll ask my Ying Clan’s ancestor to talk with the Secret Sect’s higher-ups and see if we’re able to make the Secret Sect hand Yang Ye over. If they refuse, then we’ll have no choice but to think of something else! Alright, it’s decided!”

Ying Qing seemed like he’d grown many years older in an instant.

Ying Qing wasn’t the only one like that, the others had quite unsightly expressions on their faces too.

They were helpless against Yang Ye for now, but once Yang Ye grew further, they could imagine what sort of revenge their clans would have to face!

In a short time from now, Yang Ye may become their nightmares!

…

The Secret Sect.

At this moment, Yang Ye was still in confrontation with the woman in a black dress, but they weren’t fighting.

Not too long passed before the black robed old man and the woman in a white dress appeared not too far away from Yang Ye.

Yang Ye glanced at the woman in a white dress, and then glanced at the woman in a black dress. Needless to say, they were definitely twins. Because they looked too much like each other. If it wasn’t for their clothes, it would be impossible to differentiate between them!

Yun Qian glanced at the woman in a black dress and frowned slightly, “It’s you!”

The woman in a black dress glanced coldly at Yun Qian, and then she vanished on the spot.

Meanwhile, the black robed old man gazed at Yang Ye, or to be more precise, he was looking at the wooden sword in Yang Ye’s grasp.

He gazed at the wooden sword for a long time. In the end, he gazed at Yang Ye, “I don’t care what kind of enmity you have with the Ying Clan and those other clans, my Secret Sect can give you protection, but you have to work with my Secret Sect and obey my Secret Sect’s commands!”

Yang Ye was stunned upon hearing this, and then he shook his head and chuckled, “Old man, I think you’ve made a mistake. I don’t need your Secret Sect’s protection, and I don’t need charity from others. I came here to fulfil my promise, not to seek protection from your Secret Sect.”

The old man looked Yang Ye in the eyes, “You’re very stubborn. Leave then! Right, the Ying Clan and those other clans are still outside!” Obviously, he was certain that Yang Ye wouldn’t dare to leave.

However, would Yang Ye be afraid of leaving?

Yang Ye didn’t hesitate to turn around and leave. A breath of time later, he’d arrived at the exit of the Secret Sect.

But right when he was about to leave, the black robed old man and woman in a white dress appeared in front of him. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

The black robed old man looked Yang Ye in the eyes, “You have quite the temper. But do you think my Secret Sect is a place you can come and go at will?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “Old man, you have to realize that it’s your Secret Sect that made me come, and I didn’t come here because I wanted to. As for leaving, it’s you who asked me to leave.”

He paused for a moment and continued, “Actually, it’s pointless to say all of that. Because you clearly intend to look for trouble. Since that’s the case, then allow me to be honest. The Ying Clan and those other clans sent 40 True Realm experts to hunt me down. I’d like to know how many your Secret Sect has prepared.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he looked the old man in the eyes. His gaze was extremely calm, but it was filled with aggression!

The old man gazed at Yang Ye for a long time before he said, “You’re very confident!”

Yang Ye walked over to the old man, “Allow me to be honest. Old man, I can fight a few experts like you!”

Yun Qian’s eyelids twitched when she heard him. He…

Yang Ye wasn’t someone who likes to show off. All he knew was that one couldn’t be too nice. One had to be arrogant when necessary. Because if one didn’t act arrogantly, others would think you were a weakling and try to bully you!

It was like how even if a person was no match for an enemy in battle, so long as that person dared to fight the battle and risked his or her life in the fight, then that enemy wouldn’t dare to rashly bully that person anymore!

The weak were afraid of the strong, the strong were afraid of the ruthless, the ruthless were afraid of those who disregarded their lives, and those who disregarded their lives were afraid of the madmen!

So, if it was necessary, one had to be more ruthless and madder in life!

The old man chuckled, “Why don’t you give it a try?”

Yang Ye nodded, and then he swung his sword.

Bang!

An explosion resounded, and the black robed old man was blasted over 1km away. He hadn’t even stopped himself when Yang Ye appeared behind him.

Bang!

Another explosion resounded, and the old man was blasted over 1km away again.

Just like that, in less than a dozen breaths of time, the old man was pushed back incessantly. He was completely suppressed in battle, and he couldn’t even fight back!

Yun Qian was stunned by this scene.

The old man was at the 5th stage of the True Realm!

However, he couldn’t even fight back against Yang Ye!

Is this Yang Ye’s strength? It’s that terrifying?

Yang Ye’s current strength wasn’t sufficient to fight 6th stage True Realm experts, but it was enough to fight 5th stage True Realm experts. Coupled with the fact that he’d launched a sudden attack and had taken the old man by surprise, that was why such a scene had been created.

Around 15 minutes later, Yang Ye stopped after blasting the old man back again. He just looked at the old man and said, “Old man, see that? I’ve only been using one hand until now! Just one hand!”

Yang Ye even waved his left hand on purpose while he spoke!
