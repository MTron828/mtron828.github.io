Chapter 1729 - Bite Me!

Someone on the city walls asked, “Who is that?”

“The second on the Milky Way Rankings, Ying Mu!”

Someone explained, “He’s the Ying Clan’s successor, Ying Mu! He’s an extraordinary genius on the second position on the Milky Way Rankings too.”

The Ying Clan!

It was the Ying Clan’s successor, Ying Mu!

Everyone on the city walls had shock in their eyes. They hadn’t expected even the Ying Clan’s successor to come.

They expected a fierce battle!

A truly fierce battle!

Even though they didn’t know how strong Yang Ye really was, based on the strength he’d revealed just now, Yang Ye was extremely strong. But Ying Mu was no ordinary expert as well. He wasn’t just the Ying Clan’s successor; he was ranked at the 2nd position on the Milky Way Rankings. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

It was obvious that if they fought, it would definitely be a fierce battle!

Yang Ye stood up. He’d heard the spectators. Even he hadn’t expected that the Ying Clan’s successor would come.

Ying Mu suddenly said, “Not long ago, a member of my Ying Clan died at your hands, right?”

Yang Ye nodded, “Indeed!”

Ying Mu took a step forward and looked Yang Ye in the eyes, “Is a member of my Ying Clan someone that you can kill?”

Yang Ye chuckled, and then he looked Ying Mu in the eyes, “Bite me!”

A wisp of ghastly coldness flashed through Ying Mu’s eyes, and then he vanished on the spot. At the same time that he vanished, Yang Ye vanished as well.

Bang!

As soon as they vanished, a deafening explosion resounded, and then Yang Ye and Ying Mu were blasted backwards. It didn’t take long for Yang Ye to arrive right before the city walls, and Ying Mu was pushed over 3km away!

A pitch black iron rod had suddenly appeared in Ying Mu’s grasp.

Ying Mu glanced at the iron rod, and he noticed a mark on it. He fell silent for an instant, and then he looked up at Yang Ye, “You have some ability. No wonder you dare to act so arrogantly.”

He stomped his right foot down once he finished speaking.

Boom!

The entire ground shook violently. It wasn’t just the ground, even the people in Sword Immortal City could feel tremors.

Ying Mu relied on the counterforce to appear in front of Yang Ye, and then his iron rod slammed down towards Yang Ye’s head.

He hadn’t utilized any techniques, and it was just a simple strike.

However, it seemed to contain boundless strength, and the space around Yang Ye was cracked apart.

Yang Ye glanced at Ying Mu. His expression remained calm as he stabbed his sword forward.

He’d never feared to fight anyone in direct combat!

Boom!

As soon as sword and rod collided, an explosion resounded, and then Ying Mu was blasted away. As for Yang Ye, the ground beneath him collapsed over 30m deep.

He’d transferred all the force to the ground. So, the ground beneath him had collapsed!

True!

Yang Ye glanced at Ying Mu. Ying Mu had comprehended the essence of ‘True’. That attack Ying Mu just executed wasn’t flashy at all. It just contained strength, pure strength. If it was in the past, he would have definitely been incapable of resisting it!

Ying Mu took a deep and long glance at Yang Ye. Obviously, he hadn’t expected Yang Ye to have resisted his attack with such ease.

He’d underestimated Yang Ye!

He fell silent for a moment, and then he vanished on the spot. He was in front of Yang Ye when he appeared again, and then his iron rod shot towards Yang Ye.

Yang Ye’s sword arrived before it as soon as it stabbed forward.

Yang Ye’s sword struck the tip of the rod. In an instant, an ear piercing explosion resounded.

Both of them were blasted backwards repeatedly. But Yang Ye stopped after being pushed just over 10m back, and then he transformed into a ray of light that shot towards Ying Mu.

Actually, many hadn’t been able to notice this scene at all. Regardless of whether it was Yang Ye’s speed or Ying Mu’s speed, it had arrived at their limits. So, many couldn’t see their movements at all.

Ying Mu’s expression changed slightly when he saw Yang Ye charge at him. He hadn’t expected that Yang Ye would be able to disperse the force of the collision with such ease. He didn’t have the time to think, and he just twisted his wrist. In an instant, countless rod images appeared in front of him.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye’s sword arrived.

Bang!

The rod images were blasted into bits, and then Ying Mu was blasted over 3km away. As soon as he stopped himself, Yang Ye appeared before him, and a sword immediately stabbed towards his forehead!

Ferocity flashed through Ying Mu’s eyes. He grabbed the rod with both hands and slammed it down.

Boom!

Crack!

A loud explosion resounded, and the space around them cracked open. At the same time, Yang Ye and Ying Mu were blasted backwards again.

An instant later, Yang Ye had stopped himself.

A savage smile curled up on his lips as he gazed at Ying Mu who was still being pushed backwards, and then he appeared in front of Ying Mu before swinging his sword.

Ying Mu’s pupils constricted because Yang Ye didn’t give even the slightest chance to catch his breath!

Ying Mu didn’t have time to think, and he just raised his rod with both hands to block Yang Ye’s attack.

He hadn’t swung it at Yang Ye because the force created from such a collision would be too great, and Yang Ye’s ability to disperse the force acting on himself was much better than him. So, if Ying Mu continued to attack like that, he would be the one who would be at a disadvantage. So, he’d blocked Yang Ye’s attack instead!

Bang!

Blocking Yang Ye’s attack blasted him almost 6km away. However, his foot hadn’t even touched the ground when Yang Ye appeared in front of him. An instant later, the tip of a sword arrived in front of his forehead just like before.

It was swift to the limit!

Just like that, Ying Mu was completely suppressed in battle. In just a few breaths of time, he’d been forced over 30km back!

Ying Mu didn’t even have the ability to fight back!

At this moment, everyone started doubting Ying Mu. They doubted if he was the real Ying Mu, and they doubted if he really was that Ying Mu who was ranked at the 2nd position on the Milky Way Rankings.

In their hearts, the top five on the Milky Way Rankings were like gods!

Yet now, Ying Mu actually couldn’t even fight back against Yang Ye?

Yang Ye and Ying Mu were still fighting fiercely.

However, Ying Mu could only defend himself now. Yang Ye’s rhythm of attacks were too swift, and it was to the point that Ying Mu didn’t even have the chance to catch his breath.

Just like that, an entire quarter of an hour passed.

Suddenly, a loud explosion resounded, and then a figure was blasted flying.

It wasn’t Ying Mu but Yang Ye!

What’s going on?

Everyone gazed at Ying Mu. At this moment, a beast that looked quite savage had appeared before Ying Mu.

The beast was shaped like a tiger, and it had two sharp horns that seemed like the horns of a bull. Besides that, there were three extremely long tails behind it. The tails were around 15m long, but the beast itself was only around 30m long!

Yang Ye glanced at his left hand. At this moment, he was almost unable to feel it. He fell silent for a moment, and then he looked up at the beast while a wisp of surprise flashed through his eyes. What is that thing?

Roar!

Suddenly, the beasts roared with fury at Yang Ye, and then it leaped up and pounced at Yang Ye.

It was extremely swift, and it was even faster than Ying Mu!

A cold glow flashed through Yang Ye’s eyes. He immediately stomped his right foot down and transformed into a bolt of lightning that shot at the beast.

He hadn’t chosen to dodge, nor was he able to. Because the beast was absolutely swift. Not only was it fast, it was quite large, so he couldn’t evade it at all.

Boom!

A rumbling explosion resounded, and then the city walls shook violently and almost collapsed.

The spectators looked down. At this moment, Yang Ye was below the city walls, and a huge human-shaped impression could be seen above him.

Yang Ye’s figure had slammed against the wall.

Fortunately, the city walls were extremely strong. Otherwise, it may have collapsed from the collision!

Yang Ye wiped off the blood on the corner of his mouth, and then he looked up at the beast. That beast is really strong!Meanwhile, Ying Mu suddenly laughed coldly, “How laughable! Yang Ye, that’s my Ying Clan’s guardian beast, the Vile Tiger! It’s born with divine strength, yet you’re actually going head-on against it? How laughable!”

Yang Ye gazed at Ying Mu, “So the second on the Milky Way Rankings is such trash like you. Calling for help because you’re no match for me? Tsk, tsk… What an embarrassment!”

The eyes of many carried traces of disdain as they gazed at Ying Mu. After all, it was an embarrassment to call for help after losing in a one on one battle!

Ying Mu’s face was quite unsightly, but it didn’t take long for his face to return to normal. He said, “Yang Ye, I’m not here to fight you in single combat. You killed a member of my Ying Clan, so it’s no different than going against my Ying Clan. I’m here to take your life!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he waved his right hand, and the Vile Tiger immediately pounced at Yang Ye. As for Ying Mu himself, he charged at Yang Ye as well.

Acting shamelessly? So long as he killed Yang Ye, would anyone call him shameless?

History was always written by the victor!

“Help?” A cold smile curled up on the corners of Yang Ye’s mouth, and then he waved his right hand. Qiong Qi instantly appeared in front of him, and then Qiong Qi charged at the tiger.

Bang!

Qiong Qi and the tiger slammed against each other, and then the tiger was blasted away.

As for Ying Mu, he was blasted 3km away by a swing of Yang Ye’s sword.

Qiong Qi and the Vile Tiger entered into combat. But it only took a while for the tiger to be completely suppressed in battle.

Yang Ye glanced at Qiong Qi. His strength has improved quite a bit!

But it made sense because while he was growing, Qiong Qi was growing too.

Suddenly, Qiong Qi grabbed two of the tiger’s tails, and then he dragged it along as he charged at Yang Ye.

Yang Ye’s eyes lit up. He didn’t try to move away, and it only took an instant for Qiong Qi and the tiger to enter the Primordial Pagoda.

Perfect! A smile curled up on the corners of Yang Ye’s mouth.

Ying Mu stared at Yang Ye, “What did you do to it?!”

Yang Ye glanced at Ying Mu. He was just about to speak when an old man suddenly appeared in front of Ying Mu.

Ying Mu gazed at the old man and exclaimed with surprise, “Third Uncle? What are you doing here?”

The old man paid no attention to Ying Mu. He just gazed at Yang Ye, “I’ll give you three breaths of time to hand it over. Otherwise, I’ll make dying a dream for you!”

Yang Ye started walking in the old man’s direction, “Let me help you count. One, two…”
