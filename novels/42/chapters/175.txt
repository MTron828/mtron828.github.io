Chapter 176 – Senior Sister

Yang Ye’s pupils constricted, and he didn’t dare continue his attack against the woman that stood before him. Because he sensed an attack formed from energy descending towards him from the back. He loosened his grip and Violet Spirit left his grasp.

The woman opened her eyes wide. However, Violet Spirit that shot over swiftly like a bolt of lightning hadn’t chopped off her head, and it just remained closely before her neck.

On the other hand, Yang Ye turned around, and then he swiftly clenched his right palm into a fist and smashed it ahead!

Bang!

Yang Ye was blasted flying. In midair, Yang Ye finally saw the appearance of his opponent clearly. His opponent was a white haired old man that wore a black Talisman Master’s robe yet didn’t have a badge on his robe. So, the old man’s grade was unknown.

At this moment, the old man was looking at him with a vicious expression.

After blasting Yang Ye back with a single strike, the old man took a step forward, clenched his fist, and intended to launch another attack against Yang Ye.

However, right at this moment, Yang Ye who’d descended to the ground said coldly, “Geezer, I’ll kill that woman if you launch another attack!”

The old man’s strength was absolutely not something he could go against right now. Because the energy within his body was roiling like an ocean right now while vital energy couldn’t flow smoothly. It was very likely that the old man standing before him was an Exalt Realm expert!

The old man stopped when he heard Yang Ye, and then he looked at the woman. He frowned when he noticed Violet Spirit that was stuck closely to the woman’s neck, and then he turned to look at Yang Ye and said, “What a marvelous technique of sword control. Are you a disciple of the Sword Sect?”

“No!” Yang Ye frowned as he said in his heart, why hasn’t Master arrived?

Yang Ye wasn’t a rash fellow. The reason he dared to act so arrogantly in front of the Talisman Master’s Association was because of Lin Shan. If Master still doesn’t come out now that the matter has escalated to such an extent, could it be that I really have to fight with this geezer that’s very likely to be at the Exalt Realm?

The old man was about to say something when he suddenly glanced towards the surroundings, and then he suddenly shouted. “Leave immediately. Otherwise, don’t blame the Talisman Master’s Association for being merciless!”

As soon as the old man finished speaking, Yang Ye clearly sensed that the auras of those experts that were hiding in the surroundings had swiftly withdrawn and vanished....

After a short while, the old man withdrew his gaze, looked at Yang Ye, and then said, “You’re threatening me?”

“Yes!” Yang Ye looked the old man in the eye as he spoke. Even though it was very likely that the old man was an Exalt Realm expert, but he wasn’t afraid. If worse comes to worst, he would just flee....

The old man’s eyes narrowed, and then it flickered with a cold glow. Suddenly, he glanced at the young man that was lying unconscious on the ground, and then he looked at the woman who had Violet Spirit floating there right against her neck. In the end, he looked at Yang Ye and said, “Kid, you’re a Talisman Master, so you ought to have a master. But I want to tell you that both you and your master are doomed today. You can’t afford to offend both of them!”

“Is that so?” Yang Ye said, “My master is Lin Shan. Am I still be doomed?”

If there was someone to rely on, then he definitely had to rely on that person. Yang Ye wasn’t a pedantic person.

“Your master is Lin Shan?” The old man frowned and said, “What kind of joke is that? Doesn’t that geezer, Lin Shan, only have that little she-devil Bao’er? When did he get another disciple? Kid, let me tell you. If that old geezer, Lin Shan, knows that you pretended to be his disciple, then he will skin you alive!”

“Wouldn’t you know whether I’m pretending or not if you call him out here?” At this moment, Yang Ye was very depressed. Why does no one believe me when I tell the truth?

If he said he was Lin Shan’s disciples in the past, then it was slightly fake, but it was the truth right now.

“You’re really that old geezer’s disciple?” When he noticed Yang Ye’s expression, the old man frowned as he asked this question. Because he felt that this young man before him didn’t seem to be lying.

“I guarantee. Wouldn’t you know the answer by asking my Master to come here?” said Yang Ye.

The old man shook his head and said, “He’s unable to come out here for now. He’s in a meeting with the other old fellows. Let that girl go. I’ll take you to see him once he’s done with his meeting!”

“Let her go?” Yang Ye shook his head and said, “Senior, don’t joke with me. If I let her go, then what would I do if you make a move against me again? I’m not a match for you. How about we do this? You bring Bao’er over here because she’s not in a meeting, right? Wouldn’t she be able to prove my identity?”

“Kid, if you’re really Lin Shan’s disciple, then it’s best that you let her go. Do you know who she is?” The old man said, “If you’re really that old geezer, Lin Shan’s, disciple, then you have to call her senior sister. If Lin Shan finds out that you intended to kill her, you’ll definitely be confined. Most importantly, your Martial Uncle will definitely not let you go. Right, he’d the President of the Talisman Master’s Association!”

Yang Ye was stunned when he heard this, and then he turned to glance at the woman before he said, “Senior, stop joking. She’d almost killed me with that other fellow earlier, yet she’s my senior sister? Even if she really is my senior sister, I wouldn’t acknowledge such a senior sister!”

Right at this moment, the woman said, “I merely asked if you were Martial Uncle Lin’s disciple!”

Yang Ye laughed coldly and said, “You asked? Did I not answer you? Did you believe me after I did? What could I do if you didn’t believe me? Besides that, why didn’t you stop that fellow when he attacked me? Not only did you refrain from stopping him, but you also helped him deal with me. Senior sister? What a joke! Be a bit more obedient. If you dare make any sudden movements, then see if I dare to chop off your head or not!”

The woman was about to speak when her beautiful brows suddenly knit together. Violet Spirit had moved slightly closer to her neck, and a strand of fresh blood flowed slowly from her neck. She looked at Yang Ye, and she heard Yang Ye speak in a cold tone. “Don’t spout any nonsense. I have no interest to hear any nonsense from you!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye looked at the old man and said, “Senior, please go get Bao’er.”

The old man’s brows trembled as he said, “Now, I believe that you’re that old geezer, Lin Shan’s, disciple. Only that old geezer would take such a ruthless and bolt fellow like you as his disciple. Kid, let your senior sister go. I guarantee that I won’t make a move against you!”

Yang Ye sighed in his heart. He knew that it was impossible for him to kill the man and woman this time. He said, “Senior, this woman is my senior sister, then what about him? Who’s he that senior said both my master and I would be doomed no matter who my master is. He wouldn’t be the son-in-law of the President, right?”

The old man glanced at the woman and said, “Even though he isn’t, he will be soon. However, now that you’ve severed an arm of his, he will probably be unable to now. Oh, right. His grandfather is an elder of the association. While his grandfather’s status can’t compare to your master, he’s a top-rate figure in the association. In short, you’re in trouble!”

With a flick of his right hand, Violet Spirit flew back into his grasp, and then he walked slowly over to the young man that laid on the ground. He said, “Then so be it. I can’t refrain from killing him and only allow him to kill me just because I’m afraid of trouble, right?

Right at this moment, the woman stood before the young man, and she gazed at Yang Ye while she said in a low voice. “What are you going to do!?”

“I’m going to kill him, of course! What? You want to stop me?” Yang Ye said, “Let me tell you in advance. If you make a move against me, then I guarantee... I guarantee that I’ll kill you!”

Knowing when to stop? What a joke! He liked to put an end to all future troubles!

The old man’s eyelids twitched when he heard this, and he cursed in his heart. Little madman! Lin Shan is an old madman, his granddaughter is a little she-devil, and this disciple of his is another madman. Birds of a feather really do flock together.

The woman was stunned. How could he possibly act in this way? He’s already aware of my identity, yet he doesn’t give me any face at all. Is he really someone ignorant that knows no fear?Right when the woman was stunned, Yang Ye’s figure moved around her, and the Violet Spirit sword in his hand slashed at the man’s neck. There was a saying that one shouldn’t act too ruthlessly and leave a way out for one’s self. Yang Ye felt that these words were bullshit. He was sure that if he didn’t kill the young man today, then the young man would definitely take revenge against him in the future. Even if the young man didn’t dare do it openly, the young man would plot against him. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

It was easy to dodge a thrust of a spear that was in the open, yet it was difficult to take precautions against an arrow coming from the shadows. He didn’t like leaving a venomous snake behind to target him at all times!

As for that grandfather of this young man, he didn’t care at all. He’d decided to kill the young man first because his master would be there to deal with the rest....

The old man would naturally not watch as the young man was killed by Yang Ye right before his eyes. Because if that happened, then the young man’s grandfather would definitely hate him as well. Even though he wasn’t afraid, there was no need to make such an enemy.

So, Yang Ye’s sword didn’t descend completely in the end because the old man had appeared in front of the young man. When he saw the old man appear before the young man, Yang Ye withdrew his sword, shrugged, and said, “Since senior wants to protect him, then junior will give Senior face and refrain from killing him. But if he schemes against me in the future or I’m unlucky enough to die at his hands, then my master will definitely seek justice from Senior!”

The old man was furious when he heard this, and he said, “Kid, what the fuck does this have to do with me? I refused to let you kill him because fighting is prohibited before the Talisman Master’s Association building. If you want to kill him, sure! So long as it’s not at the association, then you can kill him as you please. You can even do the same to your senior sister!”
