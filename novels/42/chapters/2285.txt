Chapter 2286 – Sword Guardian!

Snowy held the Sword Gourd in her arms and kept fiddling with it. She shook it and knocked it while curiosity filled her eyes.

Snowy knew that it was a treasure as she could sense all treasures, and that was why she’d gone to it. Otherwise, she wouldn’t even spare a glance at most things. At this moment, she was trying to study it and see what was fun about it.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye wasn’t surprised that Snowy could pluck the Sword Gourd.

He’d encountered many divine treasures in the world, and practically none of them rejected Snowy, including the Primordial Axe of Creation. Didn’t it become an axe in Snowy’s paws too?

As for Sword Scroll, she was still shocked. No one in Eternal Border knew better than her about how special the Sword Gourd was. It could be said that even the Limitless Sword Master hadn’t been able to make the Sword Gourd take him seriously.

She’d only brought Yang Ye here because Yang Ye possessed the Sword Domain, so he had a slight chance.

However, she hadn’t expected Yang Ye to fail. But that little fellow had actually plucked the Sword Gourd and even dared to play around with it. What surprised her more was that the Sword Gourd actually didn’t resist at all and just allowed the little fellow to do as she pleased.

A long time passed before Snowy gazed at the Sword Gourd, blinked, and flew over to Yang Ye. She raised it in Yang Ye’s direction and kept blinking.

Yang Ye asked, “For me?”

She nodded. She knocked the Sword Gourd with one paw and puckered her lips. She was saying that it wasn’t fun at all.

Even the best treasures were nothing to Snowy if they weren’t fun to play with!

At this moment, the Sword Gourd had been blacklisted by her.

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and wanted to take it, but it trembled, and then a ray of sword intent stopped Yang Ye’s hand.

Yang Ye frowned at the sight of this.

Snowy blinked, glanced at the Sword Gourd, and then started knocking it. But she felt that wasn’t enough, so she knocked it for a while and even started shaking it.

Sword Scroll was at a loss for words.

A short while later, Snowy looked up at Yang Ye and waved her paw.

Yang Ye took only a moment to understand her.

He finally understood why it rejected him!

Slaughter intent!

It was hostile toward him mainly because of his slaughter intent. His slaughter intent was too strong, and the Sword Gourd didn’t like that!

Yang Ye glanced at it, hesitated for a moment, and retracted his slaughter intent. At this moment, not a trace of slaughter intent could be sensed from him. Meanwhile, Snowy raised the Sword Gourd in his direction, and he took it.

This time, it didn’t reject him.

However, Yang Ye didn’t even get to study it before it returned to Snowy.

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

Snowy blinked, and then she raised it to Yang Ye and shook her head to display that she didn’t want it at all!

Sword Scroll had a weird expression on her face.

Yang Ye’s face was dark instead. He wanted it, but it refused to go with him!

Meanwhile, Sword Scroll suddenly asked, “Why doesn’t she want it?”

Yang Ye glanced at Sword Scroll, “Because she thinks it isn’t fun!”

Sword Scroll felt speechless.

Yang Ye was quite embarrassed as well, and the Sword Gourd was the most embarrassed. When had it ever been treated like this? If it was someone else, that person would be minced meat by now. However, the Sword Gourd didn’t seem to reveal even the slightest anger toward Snowy.

Ill intent!

Snowy was one of the few beings in this world who had no ill intent. Such beings were loved by these divine treasures. That was also why the Primordial Axe of Creation was willing to get close to Snowy. It was because she had no ill intent, and she was a Sprite Lord.

“It’s fun!” Suddenly, Sword Scroll said, “Here, let me teach you!”

Snowy gazed at her, blinked, and then nodded repeatedly.

Sword Scroll walked over to Snowy and spoke softly, and then Snowy blinked at her. A short while later, Snowy suddenly released the Sword Gourd, put her paws together, and started muttering something.

Three breaths of time later, Snowy suddenly patted the Sword Gourd, and then a ray of sword energy surged up into the air from within it.

Boom!

As soon as this sword energy appeared, Yang Ye and Sword Scroll were pushed backward repeatedly. Yang Ye was pushed very far back while Sword Scroll was able to stop herself quickly.

Yang Ye glanced at her, and then looked into the distance. A ray of sword energy was ceaselessly circling the air above Snowy, and sword howls resounded from it.

Snowy looked up at it, blinked, and then pointed in a direction. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

A sword howl resounded, and the sword energy shot down from the sky.

Hiss!

The sky was like a cloth that had a massive hole sliced open in it.

Yang Ye’s face turned extremely solemn from the sight of this attack. The strength of that ordinary sword energy was something he could only compare to when he used the Sword Domain.

It was formidable!

Yang Ye gazed at the Sword Gourd in Snowy’s arms and had an unprecedentedly solemn expression on his face.

Meanwhile, Snowy’s eyes lit up. She waved her paws incessantly, and as she did that, the sword energy in the sky flickered through the air incessantly. In just a short while, numerous pitch black rifts had appeared throughout the sky, and they were like a net that covered the sky of the Sword Ruins.

Sword Scroll spoke softly, “Shocked?”

Yang Ye nodded.

She spoke indifferently, “It’s countless times stronger than what you’re seeing.”

Yang Ye gazed at her, and she spoke softly, “Tell her to stop.”

Yang Ye gazed at Snowy and waved. Snowy cracked a smile and struck the gourd with her paw. The sword energy in the sky immediately returned to the Sword Gourd, and then she went over to Yang Ye with the Sword Gourd in her arms. Her chubby little face was covered in excitement.

Yang Ye rubbed her head and said, “Let’s go.”

Snowy nodded and flew over to Yang Ye’s shoulder. Meanwhile, the Sword Gourd remained by her waist. It had hung itself on her waist on its own.

Yang Ye shook his head and smiled before looking at Sword Scroll, “Shall we go?”

Sword Scroll glanced at Snowy and nodded, “It’s time to go.”

Yang Ye nodded, and then a ray of sword energy appeared beneath his feet. Suddenly, he looked to the right and frowned.

There was something there!

Yang Ye fell silent for a moment, and then he tapped his right foot down and vanished into the sky.

Meanwhile, Sword Scroll shot a glance to the right, and a woman in a linen dress had appeared there.

The woman in a linen dress asked, “Did he notice?”

Sword Scroll replied indifferently, “It’s not surprising. He does possess the Sword Domain, so it’s normal for him to be able to sense it.”

The woman in a linen dress fell silent.

Sword Scroll asked, “How long are you going to continue protecting that lousy sword?”

The woman frowned, “My Sword Clan owes it.”

Sword Scroll sighed softly and vanished into the sky.

The woman in a linen dress removed her huge sword from her back and stabbed it into the ground by her side. She sat down cross-legged and closed her eyes slowly. Countless strands of sword intent surged toward her from all over the Sword Ruins, and they entered her body. But just a short while later, they seeped out of her and dispersed throughout every corner of the Sword Ruins. Just like that, this process repeated in cycles.

If Yang Ye was here, he would notice to his astonishment that when the sword intent seeped back out of her, they had changed.

They had grown stronger!

…

In the distant sky, Yang Ye gazed at Sword Scroll, “Who is she?”

He was naturally talking about the woman in a linen dress.

Sword Scroll replied, “The Sword Guardian of this generation.”

Yang Ye asked, “Sword Guardian?”

She didn’t answer him.

Yang Ye changed the topic, “She’s really strong.”

Sword Scroll replied softly, “The Chaotic Sword Body. She was born to be a sword cultivator, so how could she not be strong?”

“The Chaotic Sword Body?” Yang Ye was stunned, “A unique physique?”

Sword Scroll nodded.

“Then what physique do I possess?” Yang Ye spoke seriously, “I’ve always felt that I have some sort of unique physique!”

She sized up Yang Ye and replied, “The Shameless Body!”

Yang Ye’s face darkened.

Meanwhile, Snowy pointed at herself. Obviously, she was asking Sword Scroll about her physique.

Sword Scroll glanced at Snowy and said, “The Invincible Cute Body!”

Yang Ye was speechless.

Snowy blinked and gazed at Yang Ye before waving her paws. She was asking him if it was formidable.

Yang Ye nodded and replied seriously, “It’s formidable, extremely formidable. There’s no greater physique!”

Snowy’s eyes lit up while pride filled her face!

It didn’t take long for Yang Ye to leave the Sword Ruins.

He traveled straight for the Shiyuan Clan!

Around two hours later, Yang Ye suddenly stopped. There was a white cloud before him, and a white robed middle aged man stood atop it. He was holding a feather fan and had a square scarf over his head. He seemed like a scholar.

The middle aged man sized up Yang Ye, and then he gazed at Sword Scroll, “There’s no need for you to get mixed up in all of this.”

She replied indifferently, “I already am.”

The middle aged man pondered deeply for a moment and gazed at Yang Ye, “I’m Hanyuan Shu from the Hanyuan Clan. You’re an extraordinary genius. If you know how to be sensible, then there would be less than a handful throughout Eternal Border who would be able to kill you in 20 years from now.”

Yang Ye smiled, “The problem is whether I can live until then, right?”

Hanyuan Shu looked Yang Ye in the eyes, “If you hand those three treasures over, then while I can’t make promises for anyone else, I can promise that my Hanyuan Clan will leave immediately and not look for trouble with you. If you refuse, then allow me to be honest, you won’t be able to leave this place today.”

Yang Ye chuckled, “Allow me to be honest, I’ve taken a liking to your wife. Can you give her to me? So long as you agree, I’ll leave immediately and never look for trouble with the Hanyuan Clan!”

Hanyuan Shu’s expression instantly fell, “Looks like you insist on being stubborn. If that’s the case, then…”

Suddenly, Yang Ye appeared before him and swung his sword.

Bang!

Hanyuan Shu was instantly blasted over 10km away.

Yang Ye glanced coldly at him, “I could sense a very, very powerful treasure in the Sword Ruins, so why don’t all of you go take it? Besides that, there’s Eternal Energy at the Eternal River, so why don’t all of you go take that? I presume as the number one power of Eternal Border, the Immortal Estate definitely possesses numerous treasures, so why don’t all of you go take from them? In the end, you just think I’m weak and alone, so I’m easy to bully. But let me tell you, I may be alone, and I am weak, but I’m not afraid of death. If you want to fight, I’ll fight you to the end!”
