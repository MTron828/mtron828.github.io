Chapter 1656 - Learning The Technique!

Translator: InVader

Just like before, her attack stopped around 1m away from Yang Ye, and then it gradually vanished.

The Sword Domain suppressed sword intent!

Unless she abandoned her sword intent, she couldn’t fight him at all. However, she would be no match for him if she abandoned her sword intent. Her sword intent was half the reason why her sword soul technique had been that strong!

Yang Ye had absolutely no need to fear a sword soul technique without sword intent.

Meanwhile, she stared at Yang Ye. This time, she knew that she wasn’t mistaken. A long time passed before she spoke in a low voice, “How did you comprehend the Sword Domain?”

A smile curled up on the corners of Yang Ye’s mouth, “You want to know?”

She nodded.

Yang Ye smiled, “We can study it together in the future. Alright?”

She gazed at him while a trace of surprise flashed through her eyes, “Really?”

Yang Ye spoke seriously, “Of course!”

She was about to speak when she suddenly seemed to have thought of something, so she thought for quite some time before she replied, “I don’t have Soul Nurturing Wood!”

Yang Ye waved his hand and spoke seriously, “What are you talking about? Meeting you felt like meeting an old friend. Talking like that hurts. So, how about we find a place to study the Sword Dao together? I’m very curious about your sword soul technique as well.”

She thought for a moment and said, “I can take you to the Ku Clan. But you better not act rashly, or you’ll die.”

Yang Ye was delighted in his heart, and he quickly replied, “I’m no fool, so how could I possibly do that? Moreover, do you think I’m capable of doing that?”

She nodded, “Let’s go.”

She turned around and vanished off into the distance.

Yang Ye heaved a sigh of relief inwardly, and then he quickly got on his sword and followed after her.

During his conversation with her, Yang Ye found out that her name was Ku Zhuyi, and she was a disciple of the Ku Clan. She was in charge of protecting Kuyan System right now. Besides that, he wasn’t able to gain any further information. She seemed quite naïve, but she was actually very smart, and she was vigilant towards him.

Yang Ye stopped trying to play tricks because she would look down on him if he still tried that.

It didn’t take long for Yang Ye and Ku Zhuyi to arrive on Kuyan Continent, or to be more precise, they arrived in Kuyan City. The entire continent had just one city, Kuyan City, and it was quite similar to the Yang Clan.

Kuyan City was comparatively quiet, and there weren’t many people throughout the streets of it. He saw people occasionally, but they just passed by in a hurry.

It didn’t take long for them to arrive at an abode. Right when they were about to enter it, a man walked out from within it. The man nodded slightly when he saw Ku Zhuyi, but he was slightly stunned when he saw Yang Ye. He asked, “Zhuyi, who’s this?”

Ku Zhuyi replied, “A friend!”

“A friend?” The man was stunned. He sized up Yang Ye, and his gaze stopped on Yang Ye’s sword in the end, “Brother, you’re a sword cultivator?”

Yang Ye nodded, “I am.” Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

The man nodded slightly, “I’m Ku Zhulin, Zhuyi’s older brother. Welcome to the Ku Clan!”

Yang Ye smiled, “Thank you.”

Ku Zhulin grinned and said, “I have other matters to attend to. Farewell.” As soon as he finished speaking, he went around Yang Ye and vanished into the distance.

“Let’s go!” Ku Zhuyi turned around and walked into the abode.

Yang Ye hurriedly followed up to her and said, “Your older brother is a nice guy.”

Ku Zhuyi remained silent.

Yang Ye continued, “Before I came, many told me not to. They said the Ku Clan is very mysterious, and the Ying Clan, Yang Clan, and Wu Clan dare not offend your Ku Clan. Er, Sister Zhuyi, tell me something. Is your Ku Clan…?”

Suddenly, she stopped and turned around to look at him, “I’m not your Sister Zhuyi.” She turned around and walked off once she finished speaking.

Yang Ye quickly followed after her and said, “Where are you taking me?”

She didn’t answer him and just continued walking.

Yang Ye shrugged and stopped asking. Presently, all he could do was take things one step at a time.

It didn’t take long for them to arrive at an underground cultivation room, and Yang Ye finally had a rough idea of her plans.

In the cultivation room, she gazed at him and said, “Come, let’s spar.”

Yang Ye fell silent for a short while and said, “I want a piece of Soul Nurturing Wood.”

Ku Zhuyi replied, “Train with me. If I’m satisfied, I’ll tell you how to get a piece of Soul Nurturing Wood.”

Yang Ye gazed at her and asked, “Really?”

She nodded slightly, “But whether you actually get it depends on your own ability.”

Yang Ye thought for a while and nodded, “Alright!”

Presently, he had no other choice. Using force? That would be no different than asking for death. No matter how monstrous he was, it was impossible for him to fight against the entire Ku Clan. As for stealing it, that was even more impossible. He’d been detected before he could even enter the Ku Clan, and now that he was in their territory, he was probably being watched by its experts.

Besides that, the Soul Nurturing Wood was so precious to the Ku Clan, so there would definitely be extraordinary experts protecting it. Once he went to steal it, even the Yang Clan would probably be unable to save him!

He had to use proper methods!

It was the only way!

Yang Ye took a deep breath and said, “Come! I too would like to experience your sword soul technique again.”

Ku Zhuyi nodded slightly, and then she vanished on the spot. She was in front of Yang Ye when her figure appeared again, and she immediately stabbed her bamboo splint forward.

Needless to say, she was extremely fast. It wasn’t just her movement speed, even her sword was extremely swift. Unfortunately, Yang Ye possessed the Enlightened Sword Heart, and his speed was swifter than hers while his physical strength surpassed hers as well.

Yang Ye flipped his palm, and his sword stabbed against the top of the bamboo splint.

Clang!

A clear and resounding sound of collision surged through the room. Yang Ye’s sword and Ku Zhuyi’s bamboo splint shook violently. In an instant, they both moved backwards repeatedly, but it didn’t take long for Yang Ye to stop himself. After that, he tapped his right foot down and transformed into a ray of light that shot forward.

Meanwhile, Ku Zhuyi’s eyes narrowed slightly. She raised the bamboo splint and slammed it down.

Bang!

An explosion resounded. The space in the surroundings started trembling violently, and then Ku Zhuyi was pushed almost 1km back.

Yang Ye didn’t follow up with another attack. He said, “Use your sword soul technique or you’re no match for me!”

He wasn’t lying. Regardless of whether it was speed or strength, she was inferior to him in both. As for sword intent, both of them possessed Returnal Rank sword intent, so she was no match for him in close-quarters combat.

However, close-quarters combat was clearly not her forte. The thing she truly excelled in was the sword soul technique, and it was what Yang Ye feared the most.

Ku Zhuyi shook her head, “Fighting you has allowed me to understand what I lack. So, I want to learn from your strong points.”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and asked, “Can you teach me that sword soul technique?”

After witnessing how strong it was, he really wanted to learn it.

Ku Zhuyi fell silent and was slightly hesitant.

Yang Ye asked, “You can’t?”

She thought for a long time before she replied, “I can.”

Yang Ye was delighted, “Really?”

Ku Zhuyi nodded, “Really. However, you have to teach me how to fight in close quarters and the Sword Domain.”

Yang Ye shook his head, “Close-quarters combat isn’t an issue. However, I’m not able to teach you the Sword Domain. All I can say is that I can activate it, and then you can observe it yourself. It’s up to you to comprehend it.”

She thought for a while and said, “That’s true. Alright, let’s continue.”

As soon as she finished speaking, she charged at Yang Ye.

It didn’t take long for them to be locked in combat.

The reason Yang Ye was skilled in close-quarters combat was that he’d been practically relying on battle to improve his strength all along the way. As for Ku Zhuyi, her combat experience was clearly not as abundant as his. So, she was completely suppressed by him in close quarters combat. In the beginning, she was barely able to fight him, but as time went by, she was gradually only able to defend herself.

Just like that, they fought for an entire day and night.

Finally, at noon on the second day, both of them stopped fighting.

Ku Zhuyi sat cross-legged on the ground with her eyes closed, and she was comprehending the experience she’d gained in battle.

Yang Ye was seated cross-legged not too far away from her. He was replaying the scenes of the battle in his mind and reexamining himself.

During the battle, he could have done better on many occasions. Of course, he hadn’t thought of those methods at that time, and he’d only noticed them when he replayed the scenes of the battle in his mind.

Just like that, around two hours passed before Ku Zhuyi suddenly opened her eyes, and she gazed at Yang Ye, “I learned a lot.”

Meanwhile, Yang Ye opened his eyes and said, “Me too!”

He wasn’t lying. The battles he had with An Nanjing were different. She wasn’t a sword cultivator, so she couldn’t help much when it came to the Sword Dao.

But Ku Zhuyi was different. She was a sword cultivator. While her ability in close quarters combat was inferior to his, she had many strong points that he could learn from, and if he learned them, they would make his technique in the sword even better!

In short, both of them had gained a lot through their sparring session!

Meanwhile, Ku Zhuyi stood up slowly and said, “You want to learn my sword soul technique?”

Yang Ye nodded, “I do.”

She said, “Let me have a look at your soul.”

Yang Ye thought for a moment, and then he issued a command in his heart. In an instant, his soul emerged from his body.

Ku Zhuyi’s expression changed when she saw his soul, “Im… impossible!”
