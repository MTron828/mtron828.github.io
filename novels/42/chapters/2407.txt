Chapter 2408 – Only Death Awaits!

A flying sword!

Along with two rays of light, two swords floated calmly before Yang Ye.

It was the Sword Supreme and Sword Precursor.

Yang Ye issued a command in his heart and they returned to the Sword Gourd on his waist.

Yang Ye waved his right hand, and the middle aged man’s soul was immediately absorbed into his palm.

Yang Ye greedily absorbed all of it, and then he gazed at An Nanjing who was standing by his side now, “You’re not angry, right?”

She shook her head, “Who kills him doesn’t make a difference!”

Yang Ye smiled, “True!”

She glanced at Yang Ye’s palm, “Absorbing souls?”

Yang Ye nodded, “It’s a secret technique!”

An Nanjing nodded slightly and glanced at the sky, “There are many more. Shall we kill them?”

Yang Ye smiled, “Let’s wait for them to attack.”

An Nanjing nodded, and then she flashed onto the city wall. She stabbed her spear into the wall and sat cross-legged there while leaning against the spear with her eyes closed.

Yang Ye glanced at the sky while a smile curled up on his lips, and then he entered White Emperor City.

Yang Ye arrived in a room within the city, and then he sat down cross-legged and entered the Primordial Pagoda.

Yang Ye glanced at his palm, and there was a pitch black vortex there.

Souls!

Since Tian Xiu had taught him the Soul Devouring Technique that day, he’d absorbed numerous souls, and they were quite useful to him.

Yang Ye clenched his right fist slowly. In an instant, the black vortex in his palm started to spin rapidly. Countless strands of energy gradually dispersed from his palm and converged into his body.

He was planning on fully absorbing these souls!

As he absorbed them, his aura grew stronger and stronger, but it didn’t take long for the aura to be gradually suppressed!

Suppression!

He was suppressing it madly!

Meanwhile, An Nanjing suddenly looked up on the walls of White Emperor City. A ray of light was descending from afar like a meteor.

Behind the ray of light was a wave of flames!

A wave of powerful aura instantly descended upon White Emperor City. If the ray of light was allowed to enter the city, the city would be transformed into ruins in an instant!

An Nanjing suddenly stood up, and then she kicked the spear before her.

Bang!

The spear tore through the air and slammed against the ray of light.

Bang!

The sky exploded apart and sparks sprayed!

Suddenly, an ethereal and towering palm descended from above, and it enveloped the entire city within it.

An Nanjing stretched out her right hand, and a spear appeared in her grasp. An instant later, she hurled up into the sky.

Hiss!

The spear tore through the air and stabbed the palm.

Hiss!

The spear pierced through the center of the palm, and then a wave of powerful energy rippled out of it. In an instant, the palm was turned to ash!

An old man stood high above in the clouds.

He looked down at White Emperor City, or to be more precise, he gazed at An Nanjing for a while. Suddenly, he clenched his right hand in her direction, and the space around her instantly started burning. At the same time, a wave of powerful pressure locked down the space around her!

An Nanjing’s face remained indifferent as she raised her fist and slammed it forward!

Boom!

It blasted through the air!

The pressure that enveloped her was instantly blasted into bits, and the flames around her vanished without a trace as well!

Meanwhile, An Nanjing tapped her right foot down.𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Bang!

An instant later, an explosion rumbled in the clouds!

The old man appeared 3km away, and An Nanjing was standing where he’d been a moment ago!

An Nanjing waved her hands, and then two spears appeared within her grasps. A moment later, she hurled both of them at the old man.

Hiss! Hiss!

They tore through the sky and forcefully tore open two pitch black rifts in space.

The old man’s pupils constricted abruptly, and then he stretched out his right hand and shook it lightly. In an instant, a huge barrier of light appeared before him, and it was like a door that split the world into two!

Countless strands of profound energy surged within his palm before converging into the barrier of light.

Meanwhile, the two spears arrived!

Bang! Bang!

The barrier of light shook violently, and then countless cracks appeared on it. Meanwhile, An Nanjing suddenly appeared behind the spears, grabbed them, and twisted them with force.

Boom!

The barrier of light instantly collapsed, and the spears shot through.

Bang! Bang!

Along with two explosions in the sky, the old man was blasted over 10km away. An Nanjing was about to attack when the old man turned around and vanished into the sky.

He’d fled!

An Nanjing frowned slightly. Meanwhile, two rays of light flashed through the distant sky!

Flying swords!

Two flying swords vanished, and then a head crashed down from the sky.

An Nanjing turned around on the city wall, and Bai Zhixian and Yang Ye were by her side.

She glanced at Bai Zhixian, and then she gazed at Yang Ye, “Let’s go?”

Yang Ye nodded, “Let’s go to the Sword Ruins!”

As he spoke, Yang Ye flipped his palm and a sword sheath appeared there, “I sense something over there that’s summoning this sheath!”

An Nanjing gazed at the sheath, and it was trembling.

She fell silent for a moment and asked, “What about this place?”

Yang Ye smiled, “I’m their target. So long as I’m back in Eternal Border, they won’t target White Emperor City.”

An Nanjing nodded, “Alright!”

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings and said, “Let’s go!”

They vanished from the city walls once he finished speaking.

Once they left, the countless auras around the city vanished.

At a certain point in space above the city, there were five people standing there. They were the ancestors of the five clans.

The Initial Emperor glanced in the direction Yang Ye and An Nanjing had left toward, and then he spoke indifferently, “That woman is truly amazing!”

Beichuan Xiu smiled, “It’s the Martial Emperor Physique, what did you expect?”

The Martial God Physique!

All of the others had quite solemn expressions on their faces. Obviously, they’d heard of it!

Beichuan Xiu smiled, “I didn’t expect Yang Ye to find such help. It’s even more interesting now!”

“Interesting?” Ye Gou suddenly spoke coldly, “Our target is that Sprite Progenitor. Now, countless other people have arrived in Eternal Border, and some of them are even capable of making us unable to rest at ease upon obtaining the Sprite Progenitor!”

Beichuan Xiu smiled, “Why should we go fight for it? Someone will be unable to restrain themselves, sooner or later, right?”

The Initial Emperor asked, “So we strike last and take advantage of them?”

Beichuan Xiu nodded.

The Initial Emperor shook his head, “That’s what everyone else is thinking!”

Baichuan Xiu looked down and said, “I know. So, it now depends on who will be unable to restrain themselves first! Someone definitely will fail!”

“Fuck off!” Ye Gou suddenly said, “Haven’t you noticed? Yang Ye is much stronger than he was, and if this continued, we won’t be the one who takes from him, he will take from us.”

Yang Ye!

Yang Ye’s strength was growing increasingly stronger, and it was something everyone realized. None of them didn’t fear Yang Ye’s speed of growth. They weren’t the only ones, even the others hiding in the shadows were extremely afraid!

Especially now that Yang Ye had the owner of the Martial God Physique, An Nanjing, by his side!

If Yang Ye was allowed to continue, no one dared to imagine the consequence of that!

However, no one wanted to go first and allow others to take advantage of them!

So, they were delaying!

Beichuan Xiu closed his eyes slowly, “Someone will definitely be unable to restrain themselves! So, wait! Wait until someone goes first!”

All of them fell silent. While they knew others were of the same mind, they had no other choice and could only wait!

Wait!

They were all waiting until they reached a breaking point!

On the other side of the sky, there was a woman looking down at the city below in silence.

It was Nanli Meng.

She looked up at the sky, and a long time passed before she shook her head, smiled, and vanished into the sky.

…

The Sword Ruins.

Yang Ye and An Nanjing arrived at the Sword Ruins. He glanced at the surroundings, and then they vanished on the spot.

At a mountain top in the Sword Ruins, Yang Ye saw Jian You. She was seated cross-legged on the ground with a huge sword in the ground by her side.

Yang Ye and An Nanjing walked over to Jian You, and she spoke softly, “It’s about to emerge.”

It’s about to emerge!

Yang Ye spoke solemnly, “That sword?”

She nodded, “Are you here for it?”

Yang Ye was quite surprised, “How did you know?”

She replied softly, “The sheath in your grasp!”

Yang Ye glanced at the sheath and asked, “You’ve seen it before?”

She nodded, “I have.”

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and said, “Does the sword belong to your clan?”

She shook her head, “My clan owes it. If it wasn’t for it, my clan would have been annihilated during that calamity.”

She stood up slowly and continued, “If it leaves, I’ll be free.”

Yang Ye said, “I may take it with me!”

She smiled, “If it’s mine, then it will be mine; but if it isn’t mine, then it will never be mine.”

Yang Ye smiled, “Thank you!”

She nodded slightly and waved her right hand. In an instant, a huge crack appeared before her, and it went deep into the ground with no end in sight.

She said, “Go on down!”

Yang Ye nodded and gazed at An Nanjing, “Be careful.” He transformed into a ray of light and went underground.

At the mountain peak, Jian You turned around and looked up at the sky, “It may not go very smoothly!”

An Nanjing looked up at the sky with a spear in her grasp, “I’ll kill all who come!”

She just stood there on the mountaintop like a god of war!
