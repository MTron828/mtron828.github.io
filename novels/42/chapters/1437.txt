Chapter 1438 – It’s More Terrifying Than The Primordial Pagoda?

The woman and the others had extremely solemn expressions on their faces.

They hadn’t expected Yang Ye’s strength to be that formidable. They’d thought that it was the two Celestial Demon Wolves that had caused the Wilds Lord’s death, so they looked down on Yang Ye a little. Yet now, they realized that he was much more terrifying than those two demon wolves.

After all, he’d destroyed a low-grade Origin Rank treasure and incapacitated a Deity with a single swing of his sword.

Such strength couldn’t just be described as terrifying.

It was abnormal!

Extremely abnormal!

At this moment, cold sweat was flowing down the young man’s face, and there was a strong feeling of fear in his heart. Because he’d actually taken the initiative to attack Yang Ye just now. If Yang Ye had used the same attack on him, then he would have probably been obliterated.

Damn you! Wilds Lord! The young man suddenly cursed in his heart. The reason he cursed the Wilds Lord was because the Wilds Lord hadn’t told him about Yang Ye’s true strength. Moreover, he’d been careless, and he hadn’t investigated Yang Ye’s background and strength after arriving at Wildlands Stellar Region. If he’d investigated Yang Ye, he would have definitely not acted so rashly just now.

Even though Falling Sky Stellar Region was a four star stellar region and wouldn’t fear Yang Ye, it didn’t represent that he could look down on Yang Ye. At the very least, he didn’t have the ability or the right!

But he’d done that, and he’d almost lost his life as a consequence!

Meanwhile, the woman suddenly said, “I really have underestimated you. I never expected that a genius like you would be in such a place.” Even though she was a genius as well, Yang Ye’s strength had far surpassed her imagination. Even she wasn’t confident in her ability to withstand that attack from before.

That was the strongest sword technique she’d ever seen!

Yang Ye gazed at her and said, “Your Falling Sky Stellar Region wants to maintain its dignity. Alright, I can give you face. You can take the worlds which belonged to Wildlands Stellar Region. However, those worlds which Wildlands Stellar Region took from my Clouds of Heaven Stellar Region have to be returned. Otherwise, I won’t give face to anyone. That’s my limit. So, shall we fight or end this in peace? You can make the decision.”

She gazed at Yang Ye for a long time before she said, “Do you think it’s worth offending a four star stellar region for just over 30 small worlds?”

“Would you be grateful if I gave those worlds to you?” Yang Ye laughed coldly, “No, you wouldn’t. Your stellar region would just think that I should have done that. It’s even to the extent that you’ll try to take a yard and ask for even more. All of you are used to being in a superior position, and you have that terrible habit. Moreover, I have no need to curry favor with all of you. Because it’s utterly useless. My own strength is the only thing I can trust!”

The woman took a deep and long glance at Yang Ye, “I agree to your conditions. My Falling Sky Stellar Region won’t take those worlds which belonged to Clouds of Heaven Stellar Region. However, I hope that you won’t come looking for trouble from Wildlands Stellar Region in the future. Because from this moment onward, it isn’t Wildlands Stellar Region but Falling Sky Stellar Region. Understand?”

“I’m not interested, nor do I have the time to do that!” Yang Ye continued, “One last reminder. Tell your people not to offend me. I don’t have a very good temper. So, it would be bad if I kill them by accident and cause a war between us.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye didn’t stay a moment longer. His figure flashed and vanished on the spot. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Once Yang Ye left, one of the old men by the woman’s side said, “How arrogant!”

“He has the strength to back it up!” Another old man spoke solemnly, “His attainments in the Sword Dao is at an extremely terrifying level. I’m afraid that if it’s amongst the younger generation, then only those three in the top three of the Dragon Rankings are capable of fighting him.”

“They aren’t the only ones!” Meanwhile, the woman added, “There are countless extraordinary people in the world, and while many peerless geniuses aren’t on the Dragon Rankings, their strength isn’t inferior to those people on the Dragon Rankings. Just like that fellow, Yang Ye. Even though he isn’t on the Dragon Rankings, but besides the 1st on the Dragon Rankings, even the 2nd and the 3rd would probably be unable to defeat him.”

As soon as she finished speaking, she gazed at the young man, “Go get every single bit of information on him. I want it within 15 minutes.”

“Yes!” The young man bowed slightly to her, and then he vanished into the distance.

Around 15 minutes later, the young man returned here. At this moment, he had an extremely solemn expression on his face. He didn’t speak and just respectfully handed a scroll to the woman.

She glanced at him and opened the scroll. As she looked through it, her face gradually grew solemn. In the end, it became extremely solemn.

One of the old men by her side asked, “What’s wrong?”

She rolled up the scroll, remained silent for a long time, and then said, “He has the Stellar Sword Diagram and can activate it. He used it to instantly annihilate 26 Deities from Wildlands Stellar Region and a few more stellar regions.”

The old men’s pupils constricted, and there was a trace of shock in them.

26 Deities!

Not Voiders, not Semi-Deities, but Deities!

26 Deities had been killed in an instant!

Meanwhile, the woman took a deep breath, “No wonder he dared to be so unyielding, so he had the Stellar Sword Diagram. With such a divine treasure in his possession, even a four star stellar region wouldn’t rashly offend him.”

Four star stellar regions definitely had more than just 20 plus Deities, but they couldn’t afford to lose that many Deities as well! Just think about it, if Yang Ye went to Falling Sky Stellar Region, activated the Stellar Sword Diagram, and then attacked everything around him...

Just thinking about it was terrifying!

The woman remained silent for a long time before she said, “Don’t offend him. Don’t offend Clouds of Heaven Stellar Region as well. If it’s possible, try your best to express goodwill to them. Since we can’t become enemies, then we should try our best to become friends. There is no irreconcilable enmity between us.”

Meanwhile, the young man suddenly asked, “Isn’t it humiliating to show goodwill to Clouds of Heaven Stellar Region?”

The woman turned to look at the young man, “Is he not qualified to form friendly relations with us?”

The young man hurriedly replied, “Of course he is!”

She gazed at him and said, “The desire to render meritorious service isn’t wrong, but you can’t be impatient. You must take everything into consideration before doing anything. Otherwise, you might lose your life before you succeed at rendering that meritorious service.”

The young man hurriedly bowed, “Guardian Ye, I understand!”

She said, “Don’t worry, I’ll report your contribution. It’s quite a big contribution, so you’ll probably gain generous rewards.”

The young man hurriedly took a knee and spoke with slight excitement, “Thank you, Guardian Ye!”

“You deserve it!” She continued, “Stay here and work with our forces to take control over these worlds. Remember what I said, don’t offend Clouds of Heaven Stellar Region.”

As soon as she finished speaking, she vanished on the spot.

The old men hurriedly followed after her.

Once they left, the young man finally stood up straight and heaved a long sigh of relief. This time, while he’d rendered meritorious service, he’d almost lost his life, and the reason was that he hadn’t investigated Yang Ye!

...

Yang Ye didn’t stay on Wildlands Stellar Region. He went to Stellar City and used the teleportation formations there to return to Clouds of Heaven Stellar Region.

There were only 3 people in Wargod Hall. Yang Ye, Ye Liuyun, and Zhuang Weiran.

Zhuang Weiran asked, “Is it done?”

Yang Ye nodded, “It’s all done. You can send people to take control of those worlds later.”

Ye Liuyun asked, “You didn’t encounter any problems, right?”

“I did encounter some problems!” Yang Ye told them what happened at Wildlands Stellar Region. The reason he told them was because he wanted them to know that Wildlands Stellar Region was under Falling Sky Stellar Region’s control now. So, Clouds of Heaven Stellar Region had to be wary of that. After all, it needed time to develop and grow, and it didn’t need another war.

A short while passed before Ye Liuyun spoke solemnly, “No wonder Wildlands Stellar Region dared to act dumb, so it found powerful backing.”

As she spoke, she gazed at Yang Ye, “You got into a fight with them, right?”

Yang Ye nodded, “I crippled one of their Deities.”

“I knew it!” She glanced at him, “No wonder they were willing to return those worlds to us. However, I’m quite curious about why you actually chose to make a compromise this time. I’d thought that you would want all the worlds which belonged to Wildlands Stellar Region.”

Yang Ye shook his head, “It isn’t worth it.”

Even if he could get those worlds for Clouds of Heaven Stellar Region, he would have to go to war with Falling Sky Stellar Region. At that time, Clouds of Heaven Stellar Region would fall into a state of war again, and it would suffer even greater losses. Moreover, he didn’t have time to waste on it.

He only had a little over two months left to live!

“It really isn’t!” Ye Liuyun smiled, “We have countless things to do right now, and we need time. So, it’s best to avoid war, if possible.”

Yang Ye smiled, “Besides to tell both of you about Wildlands Stellar Region, I returned for another reason, and it’s because I’m going to head to the Ominous Territory.”

“You have to!” Meanwhile, Zhuang Weiran spoke solemnly, “You can’t delay it anymore.”

Ye Liuyun nodded solemnly as well. Yang Ye was the pillar of support for both the Sword Alliance and Clouds of Heaven Stellar Region. If anything happened to him, then she would really not dare to think about the consequences.

Yang Ye nodded, and then he gazed at Zhuang Weiran, “Weiran, do you know where it is?”

She shook her head slightly in response, “I don’t. My father never told me.”

Yang Ye said, “Then I’ll go ask him!”

“Actually, you can just ask the Celestial Demon Wolves!” Meanwhile, Zhuang Weiran said, “They are from there, so they definitely know it better than my father.”

“Right!” Yang Ye smiled and waved his right hand. Both demon wolves appeared in front of him. They looked exactly alike because they were twins.

Yang Ye had given them names, and it was Big Blackie and Little Blackie.

Yang Ye asked, “Where’s the Ominous Territory?”

Their pupils constricted when they heard Yang Ye, and then they swiftly shook their heads.

Yang Ye and the others were stunned. He glanced at them and said, “Take me there, understand?”

Both of them shook their heads to display that they were unwilling.

Yang Ye’s face fell, “If you refuse, then I’ll put you back inside there.”

Both demon wolves hesitated for a moment, and then they transformed into rays of dark light that entered Yang Ye’s chest.

Yang Ye was stunned.

It’s more terrifying than the Primordial Pagoda?
