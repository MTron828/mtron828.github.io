Chapter 1295 – No Chaos Will Arise While I’m Here!

Declare war!

The Sword Alliance declared war on the Veiled Region!

Yang Ye hadn’t done so impulsively. The Veiled Region had already attacked the Sword Alliance. In other words, they were already at war. However, the Sword Alliance knew nothing about the powers in the Veiled Region, and many were even unaware that the Sword Alliance had a powerful enemy.

That naturally couldn’t be allowed to continue. So, he had to make them become mentally prepared. Otherwise, if the Veiled Region’s army came, the Sword Alliance wouldn’t even know what was happening.

A declaration of war! Qian Lankong glanced at Yang Ye. She hadn’t expected him to openly declare war on the 2 sects and 5 cities. After all, their strength far surpassed the Sword Alliance by countless times.

Has he gone mad?

“Crush them!” Countless people howled in unison from the city below.

Even though they didn’t know what those 2 sects and 5 cities of the Veiled Region were, they were confident because they had Yang Ye!

Were Voiders strong?

They were very strong, of course!

But Yang Ye had killed 2 in an instant just now.

It could be said that Yang Ye was the reason why the Sword Alliance had been able to develop to such an extent. Now, Yang Ye wasn’t just its master, he was the number one sword cultivator on the continent, and the number one genius on the continent. In their hearts, Yang Ye was the 2nd Jian Wuji, and he might even surpass Jian Wuji!

So long as Yang Ye was here, the Sword Alliance would have its soul, and their hearts would be united.

As she gazed at the blazing fervor in the eyes of the residents of Doomsday City, Qian Lankong fell silent. She hadn’t expected Yang Ye’s prestige and influence to be that great. Actually, she knew that if Yang Ye was allowed to grow, then no one on this continent could stop him. However, would the Yuan Clan and the other powers of the Veiled Region allow him to grow?

Of course no!

Either the Sword Alliance or they would perish!

...

Doomsday City. Within the Sword Hall.

Only Yang Ye, Zi’er, Qian Lankong, Ye Liuyun, and Snowy were here. Yang Ye sat at the seat of the host while Zi’er sat by his side, and Snowy was on her shoulder. Qian Lankong was standing on Yang Ye’s right, and Ye Liuyun was further ahead from him.

Ye Liuyun spoke slowly, “We have 370 Emperors, 3,760 Quasi Emperors, and countless other Saints. Besides that, we have a total of 430,000 violet crystals.”

370 Emperors! Qian Lankong’s eyes narrowed slightly while a trace of shock appeared in them. After all, it was a terrifying number. Because even the Yuan Clan didn’t possess that many Emperors.

Yang Ye was quite surprised as well. He hadn’t expected the Sword Alliance to possess so many Emperors now. If he took 370 Emperors back with him to the Radiant Dimension, they would be sufficient to crush everything before them!

Meanwhile, Ye Liuyun continued, “Presently, our Sword Alliance is the strongest power on Dark Hell Continent. Because we have spirit veins and resources, so countless mercenaries and independent cultivators have come to join us. Especially those Quasi Emperors who want to advance into the Emperor Realm yet lack resources. Many Emperors actually just broke through not too long ago. Presently, there are numerous Quasi Emperors risking their lives to complete missions and obtain points. Because points can be exchanged for resources, and they can attain the Emperor Realm with sufficient resources!”

Meanwhile, Qian Lankong suddenly asked, “Why didn’t you just provide them the resources to attain the Emperor Realm?” Even though an Emperor was no threat to a Voider, but what about a hundred or a few hundred?”

Ye Liuyun glanced at Qian Lankong. Even though she didn’t know Qian Lankong’s identity, she felt that Qian Lankong should be on their side since Qian Lankong was by Yang Ye’s side. So, she immediately replied, “Anything obtained with ease will never be cherished. Moreover, they’ll slowly start to feel that it’s something they deserve.”

“I understand.” Qian Lankong nodded. Indeed, if the Sword Alliance did that, then while it could create a huge number of experts in a short period, it would plant a seed that would grow into trouble in the future. Moreover, they were able to gain without doing anything, so they would definitely become liabilities for the Sword Alliance in the future.

Yang Ye nodded. The reason he’d created the point system was to prevent such a situation from occurring. Now, it seemed like Ye Liuyun had done quite well. Because the Sword Alliance didn’t need him to provide resources for it anymore.

“Right, Senior Jian Xu and Jian Ji want to charge into the Voider Realm. But....” Ye Liuyun hesitated to finish speaking.

Charge into the Voider Realm? Yang Ye was delighted, and he hurriedly asked, “Is there a problem?”

Ye Liuyun nodded, “It requires a huge number of violet crystals, and the violet crystals that the Sword Alliance has....”

Yang Ye asked, “How many are needed?”

“At least 300,000 each!” It wasn’t Ye Liuyun but Qian Lankong who answered Yang Ye.

Yang Ye gazed at Qian Lankong, and she continued, “Do you know why there are no Voiders on Dark Hell Continent? It isn’t because they lack natural talent, it’s because they lack violet crystals. A huge amount of spirit energy is needed to charge into the Voider Realm. That spirit energy had to be ready to be absorbed in an instant, so Divine Grade spirit veins aren’t able to serve as the source for such spirit energy. Because it can’t produce so much energy at once. Only violet energy can. However, no power throughout the continent has that many violet crystals.”

300,000! Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly. He looked through his possessions and noticed that he had around 700,000 violet crystals. All of them were violet crystals that Snowy had produced after he killed Voiders.

700,000 violet crystals! Yang Ye fell silent for a moment before he said, “Tell Senior Jian Xu and Jian Ji to come here!”

Ye Liuyun nodded and crushed a talisman. It didn’t take long for 2 rays of light to flash into the hall, and then Jian Xu and Jian Ji appeared in the hall.

Yang Ye didn’t waste his breath. He just flicked 2 spatial rings before them. They took the spatial rings and glanced at their contents. Both of them exchanged glances when they saw the 300,000 violet crystals within each of the spatial rings, and then they gazed at Yang Ye.

Yang Ye said, “Ask Liuyun for more if it isn’t enough.”

Jian Xu said, “We might not succeed!”

Yang Ye said, “It’s fine. You can just try again!”

Jian Xu and Jian Ji glanced at Yang Ye, and then didn’t say anything before turning around and leaving. They would naturally not try to be courteous with Yang Ye, and there was no need for that as well.

Once they left, Yang Ye gazed at Ye Liuyun and sized her up, “You’ve attained the Emperor Realm?”

She nodded, “It’s all thanks to that fruit of yours.”

Yang Ye nodded slightly, and then he gazed at Qian Lankong, “The Veiled Region has many people in our Sword Alliance. Do you have any way to expose them?”

Qian Lankong nodded, “Not a problem.”

Yang Ye said, “Liuyun will work with you. So long as you’re sure, just kill all of them.”

Qian Lankong glanced at Yang Ye, nodded, and then left with Ye Liuyun. Meanwhile, Yun Banqing suddenly walked in. Her eyes were completely red, and there were tear marks on her face. Obviously, she’d been crying.

Yun Banqing walked over to Yang Ye and knelt down, “Help me destroy the Yun Clan. I’m willing to do anything for you!”

Yang Ye gazed at her and remained silent.

“I’m begging you!” She shot a pleading gaze at him.

Yang Ye asked, “Why don’t you take revenge yourself?”

She shook her head, “You know why.”

Yang Ye helped her up and said, “I had the chance to kill that woman who tortured your mother, but I didn’t do that. Do you know why? Because I hope you’ll take revenge yourself. Helping you take revenge and letting you do it yourself makes a huge difference, doesn’t it?”

Yun Banqing spoke in a low voice, “That man is a Voider!”

Yang Ye replied, “I’ll kill him!”

Yun Banqing looked up at Yang Ye, and then 2 rows of tears suddenly flowed down from her eyes, “Thank you.”

Yang Ye replied, “They are my enemies as well!”

From the moment that the Yun Clan joined forces with the Yuan Clan to kill him, they were his enemies. So, even if Yun Banqing didn’t kill them, he would.

“Those 2 Voiders from the Qin Clan that attacked earlier were that woman’s father and older brother.” Yun Banqing continued, “If I’m not wrong, they might even have more Voiders. So, don’t be careless when dealing with the Qin Clan in the future.” Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Yang Ye replied, “Amongst the top clans, it seems like your Yun Clan is the weakest.”

“I’m not a member of the Yun Clan anymore!” Yun Banqing continued, “The Yun Clan wasn’t that weak in the past. But its descendants failed to live up to their ancestors’ expectations. Moreover, the geniuses of the Yun Clan were assassinated by its enemies. So, at this point, it only has a single Voider, and it’s even one who attained the Voider Realm by relying on the Qin Clan’s help.”

Yang Ye nodded and said, “Liuyun doesn’t know as much about the Veiled Region as you do. So, tell her everything about the Veiled Region later. Let her gain an understanding of it and let the others of the Sword Alliance know how strong our enemies are as well.”

Yun Banqing spoke softly, “Aren’t you afraid that it would cause chaos?”

Yang Ye shook his head and said, “No chaos will arise while I’m here. If they can’t truly understand the strength of the Veiled Region and if we really go to war with the Veiled Region, then they won’t be mentally prepared, and it’ll cause them to suffer a huge loss.”

“I understand!” Yun Banqing nodded and left.

Once Yun Banqing left, the black ape walked in.

Yang Ye smiled, “Senior Hei Yuan, long time no see!”

The black ape said, “I think we need to have a talk!”

Yang Ye was curious, “About what?”

The black ape said, “Kid, I’ve heard of the Veiled Region, and I know a little about it. What I want to talk about is whether you’re really going to war with them?”

Yang Ye nodded.

The black ape shrugged, “I knew it! Nothing good will come of following you! Kid, how many Voiders do we have? How many do they have? How can we possibly fight them?”

Yang Ye spoke with a helpless tone, “It can’t be helped. They want to kill me! I’m not the one who wants to kill them!”

The black ape shook his head, “My predictions weren’t wrong after all. I would definitely be unable to enjoy any peace while staying by your side.”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

The black ape shrugged again and said, “Bad life choices!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he shook his head and walked away.

Yang Ye felt speechless.

“Yang Ye! Get out here right now! Get out here!” Suddenly, a furious shout resounded from outside the hall.

Yang Ye frowned. Who’s that bold? After all, someone had actually dared to act disrespectfully to him here!
