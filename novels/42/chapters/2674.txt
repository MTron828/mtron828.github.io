Chapter 2675 – Betrayal!

Mo Yu had an extremely ferocious expression on his face.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye smiled, “What is it? Why do you have that unsightly look on your face?”

Mo Yu suddenly shook his head and smiled, “You’re trying to infuriate me. Very good. Allow me to tell you that you’ve succeeded!”

Yang Ye suddenly said, “I don’t think there’s any enmity between us, is there?”

Mo Yu smiled, “I can’t stand the sight of you. Is that a good enough reason?”

Yang Ye shook his head and chuckled, “It’s because they chose me, and they gave up on you. That’s why you can’t stand the sight of me…”

Yang Ye shook his head and said, “Seriously, if you’re a man, you shouldn’t come looking for me and should go after them.”

Mo Yu had a ferocious expression on his face as he said, “Don’t worry, I’ll make them repay me a hundredfold one day!”

Yang Ye glanced at Mo Yu, and there was a trace of pity in his eyes. This man before him was a prime example of an ungrateful bastard or felt that everyone else owed him something.

At this moment, Yang Ye thought of a saying.

Help a little and be repaid, help too much and be hated instead!

If Destiny wanted these swords back, he wouldn’t hesitate at all to return them. Because they were never his!

Even though Yang Ye seemed quite intolerant at most times, he would never covet something that didn’t belong to him. But if it was his, he would never allow it to be taken!

At this moment, Mo Yu was clearly here to take his sword!

Meanwhile, Mo Yu suddenly walked over to Yang Ye, “You use the sword. Very good. Come, let me see how great your technique is! I hope you don’t disappoint me too much!”

As soon as he finished speaking, a strand of extremely powerful sword intent surged out from him!

His sharp sword intent was bone-piercingly cold, and it caused the temperature throughout the area to become icy cold.

Yang Ye remained indifferent, and he suddenly unleashed the Sword Domain when the sword intent arrived before him.

Boom!

Space shook violently and Mo Yu’s icy cold sword intent was instantly suppressed.

“The Sword Domain?” Mo Yu grinned fiercely, “You have some skill, but…”

Suddenly, Yang Ye appeared in front of Mo Yu, and then a sword slashed down from above.

Slash!

Yang Ye loved using this move because it was very domineering.

Mo Yu remained visibly calm as he raised his hands, and a sword appeared in his grasp. Yang Ye’s sword just happened to strike against his sword.

BOOM!

An explosion resounded. Yang Ye’s sword shook, and then he was blasted away.

Yang Ye glanced at his hand as he stood 300m away, and it felt quite numb!

Yang Ye looked ahead. Mo Yu was holding a sword, a crimson red sword.

Mo Yu cracked a smile, but it was quite evil and fierce, “Do you know the name of this sword?”

Yang Ye shook his head.

Mo Yu grinned, “It’s Crimson Sky. She forged it for me! It doesn’t fear your Heaven Executor because it contains her will in the Sword Dao. Your sword won’t harm this sword. So, are you jealous? Does it make you sad?”

Yang Ye glanced at Mo Yu and shook his head, “Have you been eating too much shit?”

Mo Yu’s eyes were filled with a kind of sickly madness, “What? Is the person they chose only good with words?”

As soon as he finished speaking, he tapped the tip of his foot down and floated forward. At the same time, a crimson red ray of light flashed.

A crimson red sword shot straight down from above Yang Ye!

Yang Ye gazed at it indifferently, and he suddenly raised his sword and stabbed when it arrived just a few inches above him!

He was planning to exchange his life for the enemy’s life!

Actually, fighting like this with a person’s life on the line was more about mentality and aura!

Mo Yu’s expression changed slightly when he saw Yang Ye fight with complete disregard for his life, and he immediately went on the defensive.

At this moment, Mo Yu’s sword lost its sharpness.

Bam!

Yang Ye’s attack blasted Mo Yu back. However, this was just the beginning. Yang Ye appeared before Mo Yu again. At this moment, he was holding a sword in each hand!

They weren’t Heaven Executor and Past Life, they were the Sword Precursor and Sword Supreme!

These two swords were truly one with his heart!

The Madness Sword Technique!

Yang Ye swung his dual swords like a madman. Every slash pushed Mo Yu back. Just like that, Mo Yu was pushed over 3km back in just a short while!

As for Yang Ye, he grew increasingly insane!

Madness Sword Technique!

It was a technique he’d created himself, and it had just two characteristics—speed and ruthlessness.

The entire sky was filled with clear and resounding clangs, and Mo Yu was being pushed back repeatedly. He didn’t even have a chance to catch his breath!

Just like that, quite some time later, Mo Yu had been pushed around 100km back. At this moment, he had a ferocious expression on his face while madness filled his eyes.

Once Yang Ye suppressed him, he realized that he couldn’t fight back no matter what.

As soon as his sword intent was released, it would be suppressed by Yang Ye’s sword intent and Sword Domain. He wanted to create distance between himself and Yang Ye, but he realized that Yang Ye’s speed wasn’t any slower than his own!

He’d lost the initiative!

It didn’t take long for injuries to appear all over Mo Yu.

As for Yang Ye, there were injuries on him too, but there were very few.

Something worth mentioning was that Yang Ye hadn’t used the armor!

He liked to fight like this to his heart’s content. As for Heaven Executor, Past Life, and that armor, he didn’t want to use them if he could.

The facts proved that he wasn’t weak.

“AH!” Suddenly, a furious shout resounded, and then a flaming ray of sword energy surged into the air like a volcanic eruption.

Boom!

A figure was blasted away!

It was Yang Ye’s figure!

Yang Ye grinned as he stood there, far away, and he placed his swords behind his back. There were some fiery red injuries on him too, but such few injuries were like an itch to him!

Mo Yu’s clothes were in rags, and his entire body was covered in bloody injuries!

Besides that, he was emanating a strand of powerful sword intent!

It was full of vicious energy!

Unfortunately, such viciousness was nothing to Yang Ye. After all, his level of viciousness was much more terrifying!

Actually, if it was a competition of viciousness, then Erya was the best!

That violent little girl was someone even Yang Ye had to fear when she went mad!

Meanwhile, Mo Yu suddenly started walking in Yang Ye’s direction with sword in hand. His eyes were filled with viciousness and madness, “Lowly bastard! You’ve infuriated me now!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he leaped up with his sword in both hands, and then a crimson red sword descended from the sky.

It was like a blood red meteor!

Yang Ye closed his eyes slowly. When the sword descended to him, Yang Ye dodged to the side while completing a horizontal swing with a single sword in both hands!

The Domain Sword!

He had started to fight seriously!

Meanwhile, Mo Yu’s sword suddenly twisted and descended upon Yang Ye’s sword!

Boom!

An explosion resounded, and then Mo Yu was blasted away. Yang Ye was pushed back repeatedly by over 300m as well!

Meanwhile, a fiery red ray of sword energy flashed at him.

Yang Ye raised his sword and swung it. A ray of sword energy shot forward.

Bang!

The two sword energies exploded in midair. Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly vanished on the spot, and he was before Mo Yu when he appeared once more.

A sword descended!

The Domain Sword!

Moreover, it was with dual Domains!

Mo Yu didn’t shrink back and slashed at Yang Ye as well!

At this moment, he was in a mad state as well!

His sword descended!

Bang!

A figure was blasted away, and it was Mo Yu!

This time, Yang Ye didn’t retreat.

Mo Yu was a peak Destiny Realm expert too, but he was far inferior to Zuo Mu!

Meanwhile, Mo Yu gazed at his cracked body with madness covering his face, “Impossible, I would never lose to you… Never ever!”

Suddenly, Yang Ye leaped up and swung his sword down with both hands.

Mo Yu swiftly looked up and charged at Yang Ye.

Boom!

An explosion resounded and Mo Yu was blasted away once more!

He flew over 3km away and spat out multiple mouthfuls of blood!

An instant later, Mo Yu looked up at Yang Ye, and then he howled madly as he transformed into countless rays of fiery red sword energy that shot at Yang Ye!Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

It was like a meteor shower!

Yang Ye frowned slightly and took a step forward, and then a sword hall appeared above him.

An instant later, countless rays of sword energy covered the surroundings.

A competition of sword energy!

Yang Ye’s sword energy was enhanced by sword intent and slaughter intent, and he had dual Domains too. So, while Mo Yu’s sword intent and sword energy were quite unusual, they were still no match for Yang Ye!

It didn’t take long for all the fiery red sword energy to vanish without a trace!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye vanished on the spot.

Hiss!

A ray of light flashed, and then Mo Yu was blasted away once more!

As soon as he stopped himself, a mouthful of blood sprayed from Mo Yu. He looked up at Yang Ye and laughed ferociously, “If I hadn’t just emerged from there and only have less than 50% of my peak strength, how could you possibly be a match for me?”

Yang Ye stopped and said, “Less than 50% only? Hmm… Why don’t I let you heal up first before we continue?”

Mo Yu was about to speak when Yang Ye suddenly added, “Don’t even think about it! I was just joking!”

Yang Ye leaped up and charged at Mo Yu.

Heal up?

What a joke! This wasn’t a game!

Strike when the iron is hot! That was Yang Ye’s style!

However, something unexpected occurred!

Yang Ye stopped abruptly. Heaven Progenitor suddenly shook within the Primordial Pagoda, and then it charged out of the pagoda. In the end, it pointed itself at Yang Ye’s forehead.

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly.
