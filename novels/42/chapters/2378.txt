Chapter 2379 – Painful, Very Painful!

Yang Ye gazed at Erya for a long time before he gazed at Sword Scroll, “Do you know what her true form is?”

Sword Scroll glanced at the young girl and shook her head.

Yang Ye recalled the armless and legless man below the ruins of the Northern Sword Sect. Because based on how the man spoke, he seemed to be aware of Erya’s origins. Unfortunately, the man didn’t tell him!

Meanwhile, Erya cracked a smile, “Don’t worry, I won’t eat that little dragon.”

Yang Ye gazed at her and nodded slightly, “I know.”

While her true form may be that of a great demon, she was still kind. After all, she’d been raised by humans, so her mentality and character were no different than ordinary humans. Yet now, her nature was gradually coming out!

Yang Ye didn’t know if this was good or bad!

He rubbed her head and said, “If you need anything, just ask your Big Sis Qingshi or me. Understand?”

She nodded, hesitated for a moment, and said, “I want to go back and see my grandfather!”

Yang Ye replied, “Alright, we’ll return to the village when we can!”

She smiled brilliantly.

Yang Ye and Sword Scroll left the palace. But Snowy stayed within. According to her, she wanted to play with Erya.

Void Mountain. At the Ascension Platform.

Yang Ye sat on the Ascension Platform with Sword Scroll by his side.

The Ascension Platform was on a very tall mountain, and the scene throughout Void Mountain’s mountain range could be seen from it!

Sword Scroll took a step forward and pointed down at the ground below Void Mountain. The 100,000 swords beneath the mountain seemed to have received some sort of command, and they trembled violently while the Sky Sword Platform on Void Mountain trembled as well.

“The sword formation is ready?” Yang Ye gazed at her while speaking with a trace of excitement in his voice.

Sword Scroll nodded slightly, “I’ve repaired both sword formations. So long as we have sufficient spirit energy, we can activate them at any time. The formation with 100,000 swords is extremely powerful, and ordinary Limitbreaker Realm experts won’t be able to resist it at all. According to my estimations, even Two World Realm experts won’t be able to resist it.”

She gazed at the Sky Sword Platform and continued, “If this sword formation is included, I think instantly killing a Two World Realm expert won’t be difficult at all.”

Yang Ye glanced at Void Mountain and smiled.

Presently, he wasn’t alone. Not only did he have two sword formations, he had Erya and Oxxy. Besides that, he had numerous precious treasures. It could be said that ordinary Limitbreaker Realm experts would be no match for him. Even without those treasures, he was still confident in being able to kill an ordinary Limitbreaker Realm expert!

He could even fight Two World Realm experts!

As for Three World Realm experts, his strength wasn’t sufficient to fight them for now.

Yang Ye seemed to have thought of something and suddenly asked, “Sword Scroll, are there many geniuses in Eternal Kingdom?”

She nodded slightly, “Yes, if compared to Eternal Border. After all, they are blessed by nature. It’s like comparing a village and a city. Even if geniuses appear in the village, they can’t compare to the geniuses of the city!”

Yang Ye suddenly asked, “Do you want to return there?”

She replied without the slightest hesitation, “I do!”

Yang Ye glanced at her, and he noticed a trace of icy coldness in her eyes.

They chatted for a while, and then Yang Ye went to the cultivation room.

He sat down cross-legged, and a white jade bottle was before him. It was the divine blood he’d obtained from the old man with a bamboo chest. There wasn’t much blood there, only around five drops, but the energy they contained was extremely formidable.

Yang Ye hesitated for a while and decided against it in the end.

He wasn’t completely confident in being able to refine and absorb a drop of the blood!

Yang Ye put it away and closed his eyes slowly.

Fortify his cultivation and cultivate Primal Profound Energy!

That was his goal right now. Especially Primal Profound Energy. Actually, the Primal Profound Energy was a huge reason why he could swing his sword four times with the Sword Domain. It had very harsh requirements on physical strength and the strength of his arms.

If he could attain the 3rd level of Primal Profound Energy, the Heavenshaker Realm, then he would definitely be able to break through and advance to being capable of swinging his sword five times with the Sword Domain!

Outside the Primordial Pagoda.

Nanli Meng glanced at Yang Ye, and then she withdrew the thick scroll and started writing, “The Primal Era…”

Time trickled by, and the sun rose in the horizon.

Nanli Meng rolled up the scroll, and Yang Ye appeared here again. He stood up, and his bones started to crack. Especially his arms, a casual swing of them caused the space around them to ripple.

Yang Ye took a deep breath, walked over to Nanli Meng, and said, “Let’s go!”

She nodded, stood up, and then started walking to the right of the forest.

She suddenly asked, “What do you think?”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “About what?”

She replied softly, “That battle. While the desolate race had been forced to retreat, they hadn’t been annihilated. I think they’ll be back.”

Yang Ye replied with a question, “What does that have to do with me?”

She gazed at him and he chuckled, “You aren’t thinking of telling me to protect Eternal Kingdom, right?”

Nanli Meng shook her head, “I’m talking about Eternal Border. If the desolate race appears again, they will definitely not spare Eternal Border. At that time, will you take Eternal Border’s side?”

Yang Ye was stunned, and then he said, “I’d have to be an idiot to do that. Look, so many people here want to kill me? Not only that, they want to take Snowy from me. So, if that day really does come, I’ll tell Snowy to take all the spirit energy in Eternal Border, every last bit of it.”

She took a deep and long glance at him and remained silent.

Actually, Yang Ye’s strength wasn’t very important to Eternal Border, and it was Snowy who was truly important!

This Sprite Progenitor wasn’t the same Sprite Progenitor from all those years ago. This one absolutely didn’t care about the world. As far as this Sprite Progenitor was concerned, only Yang Ye was most important. If Yang Ye told her to take Eternal Border’s side, she would; and if Yang Ye told her not to, then Nanli Meng knew that the little fellow would absolutely not take Eternal Border’s side.

The support of a Sprite Progenitor was too important!

Nanli Meng didn’t say anything else. She’d just asked casually, and the fate of Eternal Border actually didn’t make much of a difference to her. Moreover, the desolate race may not even return!

They sped up, and they saw more and more corpses.

Corpses covered the area!

Obviously, this battlefield had been sealed up before anyone had cleaned up.

Suddenly, a sword howl resounded from far away in the sky.

Yang Ye and Nanli Meng exchanged glances, and then they went even faster.

At a gorge, a sword cultivator was walking slowly with a sword in hand, and a corpse wasn’t too far behind him.

There was a hole in its forehead!

A single attack!

The sword cultivator continued deeper into the gorge. The gorge was huge. There were mountains on both sides of it, causing people to feel extremely small while standing within it. The sword cultivator glanced at the mountains on both sides, and countless auras on them moved away!

It didn’t take long for the sword cultivator to leave the gorge. Outside of it was a boundless grassland, and the grass there was very tall!

The sword cultivator continued forward. Everywhere he passed, the grass parted to form a path.

Suddenly, the ground before him shook, and then it cracked open to reveal a colossus that was crawling out from down below.

It was huge like a hill. It was shaped like a tiger, with legs that were thick as pillars and very long. The colossus had a ferocious appearance. Especially its eyes that were very vicious. Besides that, it had a pair of wings.

The colossus gazed at the sword cultivator and growled, revealing two long fangs.

The sword cultivator glanced at it without even a ripple in his gaze, and then he continued forward. It didn’t take long for him to arrive just around 10m away from it.

As far as the demon was concerned, the sword cultivator’s actions were a form of provocation.

The ferocious demon beast roared furiously at the sword cultivator, and then it pounced at the sword cultivator.

It was like a tiger pouncing at its prey, and the powerful impact it had caused space to crack open before it.

The sword cultivator didn’t stop, and then a ray of light flashed.

The sword cultivator was behind the demon beast.

The sword cultivator continued forward while the ferocious demon beast had stiffened on the spot behind him. A moment later, it crashed to the ground.

A ray of light had pierced its stomach!

The demon beast’s eyes were opened wide, and its body was twitching incessantly.

While it was still alive, it was just a matter of time before it died.

The sword cultivator didn’t turn around to strike the killing blow. It had been many years since he’d swung his sword a second time against the same target.

The reason that demon was still alive was because the sword cultivator hadn’t aroused any desire to kill it. That attack hadn’t struck any lethal points on it, but even then, the demon couldn’t endure the might of it!

The sword cultivator walked further and further away, and it didn’t take long for him to vanish from the demon beast’s field of vision.

The demon beast closed its eyes in despair and awaited its end.

It had sensed that the sword cultivator was dangerous, but it hadn’t expected him to be this dangerous!

The sword cultivator continued forward, and it didn’t take long for him to stop. He was by the side of a cliff, and a bottomless abyss was before him. At the center of the abyss was a black chair.

The chair just stood there!

The sword cultivator closed his eyes slowly as he stood there, and then he took a step forward. The chair was in front of him once he took that step.

Suddenly, a man appeared on the chair. He had his back to the sword cultivator, and his hair flowed down on the chair.

“The extremes of the Sword Dao!” The man spoke abruptly, “You’re much stronger than that fellow who called himself the Sword God all those years ago. Unfortunately, he couldn’t even swing his sword before me!”

The sword cultivator looked down at his sword and spoke softly, “I really want to swing my sword seriously. Unfortunately, I’ve never had a chance. It’s a painful, very painful feeling!”
