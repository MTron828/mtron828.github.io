Chapter 1873 – Reform!

Hunting Xenosprites!

Rays of light frequently appeared within the mist.

Three days later, Yang Ye had obtained 32 Sprite Cores. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

At an empty area, Yang Ye glanced at the Sprite Cores in his possession, and then he turned around with the intent to leave. However, his expression suddenly changed, and then a powerful aura slapped down upon him from the sky.

Yang Ye raised his sword and swung it.

Om!

A ray of golden light flashed, and then the aura was sliced into bits.

Meanwhile, a Xenosprite appeared not too far away from Yang Ye. This Xenosprite was unlike the Xenosprites Yang Ye encountered in the past. Firstly, its body was almost three times larger than them. Besides that, it had a pair of huge black wings!

What is that? Yang Ye’s mind was filled with questions.

The Xenosprite spoke fiercely, “Damnable human! You dare to break the agreement between my race and the human race?!”

“Agreement?” Yang Ye was stunned, “What agreement?”

“Playing dumb?” The Xenosprite spoke angrily, “Since you’ve broken the agreement, then we naturally don’t have to abide by it as well.”

He was about to attack once he finished speaking, but a voice suddenly resounded, “He really didn’t know.”

As soon as the voice finished resounding, a middle aged man appeared near Yang Ye.

A trace of solemness arose in the Xenosprite’s eyes when he saw the middle aged man, “Heavenly Saber, what’s the meaning of this?”

It was one of the four Heavenly Exalts, the Heavenly Saber Exalt!

Heavenly Saber replied, “Xenosprite General, he’s new to Heaven Pillar Mountain, so he really is unaware of the agreement between our races.”

Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly asked, “What agreement?”

The Heavenly Saber Exalt turned to glance at Yang Ye, and then he explained, “Our races agreed that humans can come here to hunt Xenosprites, and Xenosprites were naturally allowed to devour humans as well. But…”

He gazed at Yang Ye and continued, “You’ve killed too many!”

Yang Ye was stunned speechless.

Meanwhile, the Heavenly Saber Exalt’s voice resounded in his mind, “Kid, you went too far. The Xenosprites wouldn’t be able to endure it if you continued killing at that pace.”

Yang Ye smiled with embarrassment. He really wasn’t aware of this. Now, he had a rough understanding. The Xenosprites and humans were using each other to train their people. So, they were allowed to kill each other to strengthen themselves!

Suddenly, the Xenosprite said, “He must die!”

The Heavenly Saber Exalt glanced at the Xenosprite and asked, “Are you sure?”

The Xenosprite General replied, “What? You intend to protect him?”

The latter shook his head, “He doesn’t need my protection. But allow me to give you a piece of advice. It’s best if you don’t do this, or your race will have a huge headache!”

“Hmph!” The Xenosprite General glanced coldly at Yang Ye, “Just him?”

The Heavenly Saber Exalt shrugged, “Do as you wish!”

He moved 3km back once he finished speaking.

The Xenosprite heaved a sigh of relief when he saw the Heavenly Sabert Exalt move away, and then he gazed at Yang Ye, “You damnable human!”

His figure immediately transformed into a ray of black light that shot at Yang Ye.

Needless to say, the Xenosprite General was extremely strong. Just the aura he emanated made Yang Ye feel a huge amount of pressure.

Yang Ye’s expression was calm as he raised his sword and swung it.

Om!

A sword howl resounded, and a ray of golden light flashed.

Bang!

A muffled explosion resounded, and then a black shadow was blasted away. It flew for over 10km before finally stopping.

It was the Xenosprite General!

As soon as he stopped himself, his right arm fell off his shoulder, and blood sprayed from it.

He glanced at his severed arm, and then he looked up at Yang Ye. Astonishment filled his eyes, “You… you…”

Yang Ye said, “What?”

The Xenosprite General said, “You… are so strong…”

Yang Ye felt speechless.

Suddenly, a ball of black light descended from the sky, and then it descended before the Xenosprite General. The black light dispersed to reveal a dark violet Xenosprite.

The Heavenly Saber Exalt frowned slightly when he saw this Xenosprite.

Yang Ye’s expression was slightly solemn as well because the dark violet Xenosprite felt different!

The dark violet Xenosprite glanced at the Heavenly Saber Exalt and said, “What? The humans don’t plan to abide by the agreement anymore?”

The Heavenly Saber Exalt shook his head, “We can’t represent the human race!”

The dark violet Xenosprite nodded slightly and gazed at Yang Ye, “No matter who you are, you have to pay for what you’ve done.”

The Xenosprite was about to attack once he finished speaking, but his gaze suddenly descended onto Yang Ye’s sword. His pupils constricted when he saw the sword, “You’re Yang Ye!”

Yang Ye was stunned, “You know me?”

The dark violet Xenosprite’s face fell when he heard Yang Ye admit it. Quite some time passed before he gazed at Yang Ye, “You can leave! Don’t come back here again or bear the consequences!”

Yang Ye was stunned. What?

Suddenly, the Heavenly Saber Exalt said, “Let’s go!”

Yang Ye glanced at the dark violet Xenosprite and vanished into the sky.

“Farewell!” The Heavenly Saber Exalt vanished once he finished speaking.

Once both of them left, the Xenosprite General spoke in a low voice, “Why did you let him go?”

The dark violet Xenosprite replied, “His name is Yang Ye!”

The Xenosprite General frowned, “Yang Ye? Who?”

The dark violet Xenosprite answered, “A madman… If we don’t let him go, we will be the ones who suffer. Give my command. Don’t attack him and immediately run on sight of him…”

The dark violet Xenosprite looked up towards the direction Yang Ye had left towards, “We can’t afford to offend him, but we can hide from him!”

…

Meanwhile, Yang Ye cupped his fist to the Heavenly Saber Exalt, “Thank you for what you did back there!”

The Heavenly Saber Exalt shook his head slightly, “It was nothing. But it’s best if you don’t go there anymore. The Xenosprites have almighty figures too. While you’re extremely strong now, your strength still isn’t sufficient to deal with those almighty figures of their race.

Yang Ye nodded. There wasn’t a gap between him in the Heavenly Saber Exalt, but he had no doubt that there was a huge gap between his strength and the strength of the ancient cultivators.

The Heavenly Saber Exalt added, “I heard the Elegant Exalt contacted you?”

Yang Ye nodded, “Why?”

The Heavenly Saber Exalt hesitated for a moment and said, “She isn’t ordinary. It’s best if you be careful!”

He vanished into the sky once he finished speaking.

Yang Ye fell silent for a while, and then he vanished on the spot.

In a temporary hall deep within the mountains, Yang Ye withdrew all the Sprite Cores he had.

Yang Lianshuang glanced at Yang Ye and said, “We should be able to attain the 6th stage of the True Realm with these!”

The 6th stage of the True Realm!

Yang Ye took a deep breath. Once they attained the 6th stage of the True Realm, Heavenly Exalts would really be ants before them. As for when they joined forces, perhaps they could even fight an ancient cultivator.

The reason he wasn’t sure was that the ancient cultivators he’d met were absolutely formidable and terrifying!

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts and asked, “Where are Nether Maiden and the others?”

“Cultivating!” Yang Lianshuang continued, “All of them are cultivating.”

Yang Ye nodded, “I’m going to enter closed door cultivation too. Contact me if you need something!”

He vanished on the spot.

She glanced at the Sprite Cores before her and spoke softly, “Thanks…”

…

Yang Ye found a quiet place and entered the Primordial Pagoda.

Yang Ye went over to Hou Qing, “Senior, I should be able to use the Spirit Shaping Tree and Soul Nurturing Flower now, right?”

Hou Qing nodded, “Yes!”

Yang Ye waved his right hand, and they appeared before him. He gazed at Hou Qing, and the latter tapped the Spirit Shaping Tree, causing it to transform into a ray of dark light that entered Yang Ye’s forehead.

In an instant, Yang Ye’s eyes opened wide, and then his face and body were covered in bulged up veins. They were like numerous tiny snakes, and it was extremely terrifying.

Meanwhile, Hou Qing tapped again, and the Soul Nurturing Flower transformed into a ray of dark light that entered Yang Ye’s forehead.

Time trickled by. The changes in Yang Ye were growing more and more obvious. In the end, his entire body was emanating a slight dark light.

Just like that, around 10 days passed before Yang Ye slowly opened his eyes.

Hou Qing asked, “How do you feel?”

Yang Ye took a deep breath, “Refreshed!”

That was what he felt!

Hou Qing smiled, “Your spirit and soul aren’t any weaker to Enlightened Realm experts now, and it’s even to the extent that it surpasses ordinary Enlightened Realm experts. You can learn shaman techniques now.”

Surprisingly, Yang Ye shook his head.

Hou Qing asked, “What is it?”

Yang Ye took a deep breath, “I want to merge my sword techniques. Especially my Sword Soul Technique. No, I want to merge everything I’ve learned in the past. I want to find my own path of the Sword Dao!”

Hou Qing said, “You have an idea?”

Yang Ye nodded, “It’s quite an insane idea. If I succeed… Hehehe…”
