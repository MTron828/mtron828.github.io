Chapter 2212 – The Sprite of Slaughter!

A middle aged man was standing not too far away from him, and it was none other than Yang Wudi.

However, Yang Wudi had his hands.

The Sprite of Slaughter was forcefully suppressed on the ground, and it couldn’t move at all.

Yang Wudi gazed at Yang Ye, “Are you surprised?”

Yang Ye nodded. He hesitated for a moment and said, “This isn’t your main body?”

Yang Wudi smiled, “Of course not!”

Yang Ye lowered his head slightly.

Meanwhile, Yang Wudi grabbed the Sprite of Slaughter over to Yang Ye, “It’s a clone I left here, and it has 50% of my strength!”

As he spoke, he gazed at the Sprite of Slaughter, “I’m here for this guy.”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Why?”

Yang Wudi explained, “You came into contact with that prehistoric expert, and that allowed this Sprite of Slaughter to gain knowledge of your existence. He asked the prehistoric expert to capture you and bring you here. I stopped them before, but I felt that this fellow wasn’t ordinary, so I followed them. After that, I realized that he really wasn’t ordinary. So, I left a contingency plan in place. Sure enough, you came here in the end!”

Yang Ye spoke in a low voice, “You wouldn’t have died if this clone of yours was present that day, right?”

Yang Wudi gazed at Yang Ye for a long time, and then he spoke softly, “I didn’t want to make your mother wait for too long!”

Yang Ye lowered his head and fell silent.

Yang Wudi continued, “A peerless expert? Eternal life? Actually, I don’t want any of that. I just want to be by your mother’s side and watch the sunrise, watch the sunset, and plant some crops. However, destiny plays tricks on us all. At many times, the simplest things are actually the most difficult.”

Yang Ye asked, “It’s because of me, right?”

Yang Wudi smiled, “After you were born, you and your mother were everything to me. We could give up everything for you. Actually, I’m really proud. I’m truly proud because my son is no coward! Actually, my hopes for you were never great, but there’s one thing you must have, and it’s that people of our Yang Clan must never be cowards. Life is neither long nor short, so how can you live it in fear?”

He gazed at the Sprite of Slaughter and continued, “This thing isn’t ordinary at all. If it hadn’t been careless and thought I’d died to it, it would probably take quite a bit of effort to deal with it!”

Yang Ye asked, “Is it useful?”

“Of course!” Yang Wudi smiled, “It may be useless to others, but it’s very useful to you. Especially now!” Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Yang Ye asked, “What do you mean?”

Yang Wudi smiled, “Your slaughter intent is at the Progenitor Realm, so taking another step forward is extremely difficult. But if you have it, it can help you take half a step forward. Moreover, you’ll gain a powerful companion in battle!”

He flicked the Sprite of Slaughter, and it transformed into a ray of blood red light that entered Yang Ye’s forehead. Or to be more precise, it entered the black dot on Yang Ye’s forehead.

Once it entered the black dot, Yang Ye’s face warped. At the same time, the Primordial Pagoda appeared above him and waves of golden light suppressed the Sprite of Slaughter, hatred, and resentment in Yang Ye!

However, the Primordial Pagoda’s effort didn’t make a difference this time!

It was completely useless!

Yang Ye felt like his head was about to explode.

Meanwhile, Yang Wudi suddenly said, “Hold on! It’ll just take a while!”

Yang Ye gritted his teeth. A long time passed before Yang Wudi waved his right hand, and then a young girl in a red Dudou appeared before Yang Ye. She seemed to be around three years old and had pigtails. But her pigtails were black and red respectively.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye felt slightly better and spoke softly, “What’s that?”

Yang Wudi gazed at the girl, “I’ve eliminated the intelligence of the Sprite of Slaughter, and I made its body merge with the hatred and resentment within you. After they merged together, it transformed once more into a Sprite with your slaughter intent as its foundation. So, she can be considered as a materialization of your slaughter intent. However, she's not just your slaughter intent. It’s a merger of three different things.”

Meanwhile, the young girl opened her eyes. At the instant she did that, Yang Ye noticed that her eyes were blood red, just like his.

She gazed at Yang Ye, hesitated for a moment, and then flew over to Yang Ye and touched his chest lightly.

Yang Ye stretched out his hand. Meanwhile, she blinked and put her hand on his palm.

Yang Ye spoke softly, “You’ll be Scarlet from now on. Alright?”

Scarlet? She blinked, and then nodded to display her agreement. After that, she transformed into a ray of red light that entered Yang Ye’s forehead. Or to be more precise, she’d entered his sea of consciousness.

Yang Ye asked, “Is she dangerous?”

Yang Wudi grinned, “Innumerable hatred and resentment coupled with your slaughter intent and the Sprite of Slaughter… Do you think she’s dangerous? Of course, she isn’t dangerous to you because she was born because of you. So, to a certain extent, you created her. She has just been born, so there’s a lot for her to get accustomed to. You’ll realize how terrifying she is, soon enough.”

Yang Ye nodded, “Alright!”

Yang Wudi smiled, “Now, you should be thinking about how to leave this place!”

Yang Ye asked, “Are you going with me?”

Yang Wudi smiled, “Of course!”

Just like that, the pair of father and son left the hall, and a woman was standing a short distance away. It was Dugu Juetian.

Three old men with canes in their grasps were standing behind her.

All three of them looked exactly the same!

Dugu Juetian walked slowly toward them, “I didn’t expect this, I truly didn’t. So your loss was faked.”

Yang Wudi smiled, “Only one person has ever been able to defeat me in single combat. Besides him, I, Yang Wudi, have never really lost a battle. Want to try me?”

“Of course!” As soon as she finished speaking, a spear appeared before him. Yang Wudi shook his head and pressed his palm down.

Bang!

The spear was instantly pressed against the grow. However, Dugu Juetian had suddenly appeared in front of him, and then a short sword swept toward his throat.

Meanwhile, Yang Wudi tapped his right foot down.

Bang!

An explosion resounded, and then Dugu Juetian was blasted over 10km away.

As soon as she stopped herself, Yang Wudi had slammed his fist at her from afar.

Boom!

A powerful wave of energy swept out from his fist, and it surged at her like a torrent.

Bang!

Dugu Juetian was blasted far away. As soon as she stopped herself, Yang Wudi appeared in front of her. Her reaction was extremely quick, and she immediately stabbed a spear at him.

Crack!

The space around her instantly cracked apart, and the powerful force the spear carried forced Yang Wudi to a stop.

Meanwhile, Yang Wudi suddenly flicked lightly.

Bang!

It struck against the tip of the spear, causing it to tremble violently. Meanwhile, Yang Wudi grabbed the spear’s tip and swung it.,

Bang!

Dugu Juetian was blasted away again.

Meanwhile, Yang Wudi’s figure flashed into the sky. He looked down at Dugu Juetian’s figure that was still moving backward, and then he pulled his palms away from himself. In an instant, the space around him warped strangely.

Crack!

A clear and melodious crack resounded, and then blood seeped out from the corner of Dugu Juetian’s mouth. Meanwhile, the other two spears on her back shot up into the air. In an instant, they transformed into two rays of dark light that shot toward Yang Wudi.

Yang Wudi casually waved his hand in midair.

Bang!

The spears were blasted away. Meanwhile, Dugu Juetian flashed, and a speck of cold light instantly appeared before Yang Wudi’s forehead. Dugu Juetian was behind the cold light!

Yang Wudi took a small step back, and then he clawed forward with his right hand. Space instantly turned ethereal, and then he slammed his palm forward.

Bang!

Dugu Juetian was slammed extremely far away.

Dugu Juetian hadn’t even been able to stop herself when Yang Wudi slapped his palm forward!

Bang!

The space around Dugu Juetian was instantly obliterated, but Yang Wudi frowned slightly in response.

In the obliterated expanse of space, Dugu Juetian’s figure still remained, and a huge Nefarious stood below her. It was almost double the size of any Nefarious Yang Ye had seen in the past!

An undying cavalry!

The undying cavalry were strongest when they had their Nefarious!

At this moment, Dugu Juetian’s aura had changed completely.

If her aura was like that of a river before this, it was like an ocean now!

She held her spear in hand as she gazed coldly at Yang Wudi, “Again!”

As soon as she said that, her spear suddenly shot forward!

Bang!

Yang Wudi was blasted over 3km back. However, he shook his head and grinned, “It is getting a little interesting, but I’m not interested in wasting my time on you!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Wudi closed his eyes. At the same time, he clenched his fists slowly, and the space around him instantly froze.

An instant later, he opened his eyes, “World Shatter!”

Crack!

A loud and clear crack resounded, and then Dugu Juetian’s eyes opened wide. Meanwhile, the Nefarious below her exploded apart into a pile of mush. Moreover, her figure started to crack apart as well, bit by bit.

At this moment, shock filled her eyes!

Astonishment!

Step!

Suddenly, a footstep resounded from deep within the city.

Only the sound of those footsteps remained in the world.

Yang Wudi frowned slightly and turned around. At the same time, a spear tore through the air toward him.

A wooden spear!

An extremely ordinary wooden spear!

However, Yang Wudi’s frown deepened instead.

Boom!

A wave of terrifying force suddenly swept out from within him.

Hiss!

However, the wooden spear ignored his aura and instantly stabbed into his chest, blasting him extremely far away as well. In the end, the wooden spear nailed him against the city wall.
