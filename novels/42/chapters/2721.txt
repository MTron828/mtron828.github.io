Chapter 2722 – I Seek Death! I’m Serious!

The entire starry sky suddenly fell silent.

A short while later, a voice resounded, “Arrogant sword cultivator! You’ll pay for this!”

The sword cultivator nodded slightly, “I seek death, I’m serious.”

Bang!

A wave of monstrous pressure descended from the sky, and it caused the space here to warp.

It was extremely shocking!

However, the space around the sword cultivator was completely unharmed!

A moment later, he flicked with his thumb, and a sword shot up into the air.

Hiss!

The sound of something being sliced apart resounded.

After that, a furious howl resounded above the sword cultivator, and then the eyes turned ethereal.

It had fled!

The sword descended from the sky and entered the sword cultivator’s sword sheath on its own.

The sword cultivator walked forward, but he suddenly stopped after taking a few steps. He looked into the distance. His gaze seemed capable of passing through countless worlds, and then he suddenly smiled, “The Sword Dao of Hatred… Interesting, love that gave birth to hatred… As expected of the Sword Dao of emotion, it contains countless things.”

He looked up at the sky, “I have three regrets in my entire life. Firstly, being unable to truly fight your father. He destroyed his own Martial Dao and willingly accepted death. Secondly, I wasn’t born in the era of the Heaven Dao to fight against the Heaven Dao, Destiny’s peak form, and all the experts of that time. Thirdly, I wasn’t born in the same era as you. Fortunately, I can wait for you. I started first on the path of the Sword Dao, and I’ll wait for you at its peak.”

He walked off once he finished speaking.

A short while later, he’d vanished into the distant sky.

…

Meanwhile, two women were traveling side by side. They were in a chaotic world filled with gray mist, and nothing could be seen clearly here!

They were Tian Xiu and Qi Bitian!

At this moment, both of them were covered in injuries.

They were around the same size, and both of them looked like young girls!

Meanwhile, Qi Bitian suddenly asked, “Why did you help that kid so much?”

Obviously, she was asking about Yang Ye.

Tian Xiu had risked her life to help Yang Ye.

Tian Xiu replied indifferently, “I was weak for a period. At that time, he took care of me. His kindness to me wasn’t for any personal interests, and it was just pure kindness.”

She glanced at Qi Bitian, “What about you?”

Qi Bitian shook her head, “In the beginning, I just wanted to help Erya because I owe her. But later on, I realized that while he’s a rash fellow, he’s quite true and not evil at all. Moreover, he considers the people around him to be more important than his own life. Especially his attitude toward the Good Sprite, he has no intention to use her, and it’s just very pure love. It’s no wonder that little fellow likes staying with him!”

Tian Xiu grinned and didn’t say anything.

Qi Bitian glanced at Tian Xiu and asked, “Are you interested in causing some trouble?”

Tian Xiu replied indifferently, “Yes!”

Qi Bitian patted Tian Xiu on the shoulder, chuckled, and then they tore through space and shot toward the distance.

…

The Void World.

Sky Maiden suddenly stopped, and an ethereal figure had appeared before her.

She gazed at it and asked, “He left?”

The ethereal figure replied, “He did!”

She nodded, “That’s good!”

The ethereal figure asked, “Are you interested in going to another place?”

She asked, “Where?”

The ethereal figure replied, “You’ve devoured countless worlds here, and your strength is at the peak of the Destiny Realm. If you want to improve further, you must devour something stronger.”

Sky Maiden’s eyes narrowed slightly, “Above the 9th layer of space?”

The ethereal figure nodded, “Indeed!”

She gazed at the figure for a long time, “We’ve known each other for quite some time, but I still don’t know your name.”

The ethereal figure fell silent for a moment and said, “The Mortal Emperor!”

She frowned slightly and was about to ask when the figure added, “The first Mortal Emperor was my father, and he died at the hands of the Heaven Dao. I’m the second generation.”

He looked up at space, “And you will be the third.”

She was quite puzzled, “What do you mean?”

The Mortal Emperor replied, “You’ll understand in the future. Let’s go.”

The Mortal Emperor vanished.

Sky Maiden fell silent and followed the Mortal Emperor.

…

In a spatial passageway in the 9th layer of space, Yang Ye was swinging his sword madly through space.

He was fighting his way to the Four Dimensional Universe’s border!

In the beginning, it had been easy, but as he went further, Yang Ye noticed that it was growing difficult.

Space wasn’t just getting stronger, it was growing more powerful too. Moreover, it was an endless increase.

It gradually started to become strenuous for Yang Ye.

However, he was still persisting!

Actually, if he used Heaven Executor, Past Life, and Great Unknown, he would be able to get to his destination with ease.

But he didn’t want to!

He wanted to accomplish it with his own true strength!

Even if he didn’t have any divine treasures, he was still strong!

Divine treasures could be used, but they couldn’t be relied on! Once he relied on them, he would lose himself and even fall into a state of absolute reliance.

His own strength was true strength!

In the Primordial Pagoda, Snowy was still tinkering with Heaven Executor!

Heaven Executor didn’t have a sprite, so its strength had decreased tremendously. Thus, Snowy spent a lot of time tinkering with it every day as she hoped to create a new sprite for it as soon as possible so that Yang Ye could use it!

Something worth mentioning was that the Primal True Dragon had attained the Destiny Realm while the others were almost there as well.

Of course, even if they attained the Destiny Realm, Yang Ye wouldn’t let them join his battles. His current opponents weren’t existences that just any person or demon beast could fight.

If he allowed them to join the battle, it would be no different than sending them to their deaths!

The only one who could join the fight was Erya!

Yang Ye was certain that once she regained consciousness, she would definitely be the most terrifying. Perhaps even he may not be a match for Erya!

Erya was very dangerous!

Outside the Primordial Pagoda.

Boom!

An explosion resounded, and Yang Ye was blasted backward by over 100km!

Several mouthfuls of blood sprayed from him as he flew!

Bang! Bang!

Yang Ye stomped both his feet down and forcibly stopped himself. Meanwhile, the spatial passageway closed rapidly. At the same time, a practically suffocating wave of pressure swept toward him!

Yang Ye’s expression changed slightly as he retreated repeatedly again. However, the pressure had no intention to stop and grew increasingly stronger!

He couldn’t retreat any longer!

Yang Ye stopped and looked forward while his gaze gradually turned icy cold. He was very well aware that if he kept retreating, he would be back in the 9th layer of space!

Forward!

Yang Ye raised his sword above his head, and then he stomped his right foot down and charged forward while swinging his sword!

Hiss!

A sharp and ear piercing swish resounded. Space was sliced open in Yang Ye’s wake, and he quickly arrived before the energy.

Boom!

A moment of silence ensued, and then a rumbling explosion resounded. After that, a figure was blasted away!

It was Yang Ye’s figure!

Even he didn’t know how far he’d flown!

All he did know was that he was getting further and further from the border of the Four Dimensional Universe!

As soon as Yang Ye stopped himself, he wasn’t even able to suppress the discomfort in his heart before the space in front of him swept over once more!

Crack!

Yang Ye’s entire body cracked open.

Yang Ye forcibly gulped down the blood that had arrived in his throat, and then he leaped up and slammed his sword down.Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Boom!

Yang Ye’s hands and sword shook violently, and then his figure was blasted backward like a cannonball…

Just like that, Yang Ye was pushed back repeatedly.

Around six hours later.

A rift suddenly cracked open in the 9th layer of space, and then a figure crashed down into it. After that, a loud explosion resounded here.

Yang Ye laid there motionlessly.

Suddenly, a figure arrived by his side.

It was Yin Yang Goddess!

She shot a glance upward. The rift had already healed, and the world had calmed down once more.

She looked down at Yang Ye’s figure on the ground and shook her head, “What a pitiful fellow!”

Meanwhile, Yang Ye’s figure trembled, and he slowly crawled up from the ground.

He glanced at Yin Yang Goddess and said, “Oh, you’re here too, Senior!”

She chuckled, “What? You got bashed back down here?”

Yang Ye nodded. It wasn’t embarrassing. If he lost, he lost. He wasn’t someone who cared that much about saving face!

Face?

No, he was completely and utterly shameless!

Yang Ye sat at the side and started recuperating. He had to recuperate as soon as possible at a time like this. After all, he would be in trouble if the experts of the End World came right now!

After he calmed down, Yang Ye recalled what happened earlier.

He'd underestimated his opponent!

In the beginning, it had gone smoothly, and he felt that it wasn’t difficult at all. However, when he was really about to step into the border of the Four Dimensional Space, he realized that he’d been careless.

The difficulty truly started there!

If he used Past Life or Great Unknown, he would have definitely been able to get up there with ese. They were very special swords. Especially Great Unknown as it innately countered space!

However, he didn’t want to do that.

At most times, taking the shortcut wasn’t a good thing. Because taking too many shortcuts may result in the person losing themselves!

Meanwhile, Yin Yang Goddess suddenly said, “You should have almost arrived at the border.”

Yang Ye gazed at her, and she explained indifferently, “It wasn’t the 9th layer of space that attacked you, it was the Four Dimensional Space beyond it. It was its own self-defense mechanism. As for the 9th layer of space, its sprite is gone.”

The Four Dimensional Universe!

Yang Ye nodded and finally came to an understanding.

No wonder it was so terrifying!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye seemed to have thought of something and suddenly gazed at her, “This layer of space doesn’t have a sprite?”

Yin Yang Goddess nodded, “Why? Weren’t you already aware?”

Yang Ye was stunned, and then he grinned.

It had no sprite!

Then he could ask Snowy to create one!
