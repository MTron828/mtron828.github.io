Chapter 1056 – Why Were They Born In The Same Era?

A Saint!

Lou Qianxiao’s a Saint!

Everyone in the city was stunned!

After all, had any Saint within Pine Prefecture not cultivated for over a thousand years? Even the most monstrous genius had cultivated for a few hundred years at least. But Lou Qianxiao was only a little over 20!

So, there was only one explanation!

He was an Innate Saint!

Lou Qianxiao was an Innate Saint!

At this moment, the entire city was seething with excitement. Especially the local residents of Sky City and the cultivators of Sky Divine Hall. At this moment, they were seething with excitement and cheering.

“A Saint! Hahaha! The Junior Hall Master is a Saint! The 1st Saint below the age of 30 in the history of our prefecture!”

“I never expected the Junior Hall Master to have hidden his attainments so well! An Innate Saint! Haha! Now, Yang Ye’s past accomplishments are nothing before our Junior Hall Master!”

“Yang Ye? He’s not even trash before our Junior Hall Master. He’s just a bumpkin that popped out of nowhere, killed a few people, possessed some strength, and thought he’s unrivaled in the world. People like him are truly laughable and pitiable!

“He killed a Saint in the past!”

“According to the information I received, the Junior Hall Master has killed a Saint in the past as well. Now, our Junior Hall Master is a Saint. Can he, Yang Ye, surmount his realm of cultivation to challenge our Junior Hall Master? Are you kidding me? I’m certain that our Junior Hall Master wouldn’t even need 10 moves to kill him now!”

In the sky above, the Fox Queen shook her head slightly, “The outcome is decided!”

“Why were they born in the same era? Yang Ye is unlucky to be from Pine Prefecture as well!” The Devil Lion King shook his head.

At another area in the sky, Jian Wuchen and the others’ faces were gloomy to the extreme when they saw Lou Qianxiao stop concealing his strength.

Yang Ye could surmount his realm of cultivation to kill Saints, but that depended on the Saint. Yang Ye hadn’t been able to defeat Lou Qianxiao while Lou Qianxiao didn’t utilize his cultivation at the Saint Realm. Now, Lou Qianxiao was a Saint, so how could Yang Ye be a match for him?”

Jian Wuchen spoke solemnly, “Protect Yang Ye at any cost!”

Daoist Gu and the others standing behind Jian Wuchen nodded.

In the arena on the ground below.

Yang Ye’s face fell slightly when he realized that Lou Qianxiao was a Saint. After all, he’d never expected it. Saints transcend the world, and they could utilize the spirit energy in the world at will to ceaselessly replenish their own strength. Besides that, Saints could utilize the energy of the world against their enemy. In other words, the Sword Domain and his Void Rank sword intent’s effects on Lou Qianxiao would weaken immensely!

Besides that, Saints could comprehend all sorts of techniques that belonged solely to Saints. In short, Lou Qianxiao’s current strength was probably at least 10 times stronger than before!

Lou Qianxiao took a deep breath and waved his right hand lightly. In an instant, the space throughout the area started to warp along with the movements of his hand.

Lou Qianxiao shot a greedy glance at his right hand and said, “What intoxicating strength!” As he spoke, he gazed at Yang Ye and continued, “Yang Ye, allow me to show you how weak you are!”

As soon as he spoke, he suddenly waved his right hand at Yang Ye.

A black palm instantly flashed out as his palm descended, and it slapped down forcefully at Yang Ye.

Grand Destruction!

This time, it was countless times stronger than before, and it was infinitely faster than before. This time, it struck Yang Ye before he could even react.

Bang!

Yang Ye was blasted flying, but it didn’t take long for him to be stopped by the spatial walls that had been refortified by the green robed old man.

Bang!

The entire spatial wall shook violently from the collision, and a mouthful of blood sprayed from Yang Ye’s mouth as he crashed down at the border of the arena.

At this moment, his clothes had transformed into ashes, and there was a black colored palm print on his chest. The palm print was around 10 centimeters deep. In other words, it had struck through his chest. Moreover, it was eroding his body. Fortunately, the injury didn’t expand under the restorative effects of his violet profound energy!

The cultivators of Sky Divine Hall cheered once more when they saw Yang Ye being blasted away and heavily injured.

“See that? That’s the number one genius of the south, Yang Ye! See that? He isn’t even able to fight back before our Junior Hall Master! Hahaha!”

“It feels like the Junior Hall Master is bullying him! But he can’t be blamed! It’s the number one genius of the south’s fault for being so weak!”

“Alright, there’s no point in watching this battle anymore.”

“Actually, do all of you think that Yang Ye will admit defeat? I think that it’s very likely for him to do that. Because the Junior Hall Master will definitely not kill him if he admits defeat. After all, the Junior Hall Master has to maintain his graceful bearing.”

“Yang Ye is a sword cultivator, so how could he possibly admit defeat? Even though he’ll be able to stay alive by admitting defeat, his future is over!”

Meanwhile, Lou Qianxiao didn’t press forward and follow up with another attack. He gazed at Yang Ye and smiled, “Yang Ye, you’re a genius, and I really think highly of you. If you’re willing to submit to me and stay by my side, then I can spare you in return. Yang Ye, you have to realize that submitting to me, Lou Qianxiao, isn’t humiliating for you!”

Yang Ye gazed at the injury on his chest that was mostly restored by his violet profound energy, and then he raised his head to look at Lou Qianxiao, “You think you’re very strong?”

A slight smile curled up on the corners of Lou Qianxiao’s lips, “Amongst all the experts of Pine Prefecture and even the Saints here, no more than 3 are capable of defeating me. Yang Ye, no matter if you admit it or not, we aren’t on the same level anymore.”

Yang Ye chuckled, “You’re right, we really aren’t on the same level.” The smile on Yang Ye’s face vanished, “I’ve never thought of you, Lou Qianxiao, as an opponent of mine. Cut the crap and let’s fight! We’ll decide it with one blow!”

Yang Ye’s figure instantly vanished on the spot when he finished speaking, and he was above Lou Qianxiao when his figure appeared once more.

Yang Ye slammed his fist down at Lou Qianxiao.

“Your strength isn’t bad, but your physical strength is extremely laughable to me now. Since you’re so desperate to die, then I’ll fulfil your wish!”

Lou Qianxiao was about to attack once he finished speaking. Suddenly, an anxious voice resounded from within Sky Divine Hall, “Retreat quickly!”

Lou Qianxiao was slightly stunned when he heard this voice. Because it was his father.

Is there something I haven’t noticed in that attack of his?

Lou Qianxiao didn’t have the time to think because Yang Ye’s fist was already above his head. But Lou Qianxiao didn’t dare act carelessly because of his father’s warning, and he executed the Grand Destruction technique again.

Yang Ye’s fist slammed against the black palm. However, the following scene flabbergasted everyone in the surroundings.

Because the black palm melted like snow in hot oil, and it instantly vanished without a trace!

Lou Qianxiao was horrified. His Laws of Instinct told him that he was in danger, extreme danger. However, he couldn’t make a choice that was beneficial to him. Such circumstances represented that he was in a hopeless situation!

A hopeless situation!

Lou Qianxiao was shocked. He couldn’t be bothered about relying on the Laws of Instinct at such a critical moment, and his terrifying aura at the Saint Realm surged out explosively as he overlapped his palms and pressed them forward towards Yang Ye’s fist!

Bang!

A luge explosion resounded while space started to collapse, inch by inch, from the point of collision. It didn’t take long for over 3km of space to collapse, and it didn’t stop there and was still spreading swiftly towards the surroundings.

Everyone in the city was horrified by the sight of this! The green robed old man’s eyes were filled with shock as well. Obviously, he hadn’t expected that Yang Ye’s attack would be at such a level!

Even he wasn’t confident in his ability to resist that attack!

Suddenly, a white haired old man appeared here, and then he waved his right hand lightly. In an instant, everything in the surroundings returned to normal.

Meanwhile, all the spectators finally saw Yang Ye and Lou Qianxiao’s figures on the ruins of the collapsed arena.

At this moment, Lou Qianxiao’s arms had vanished, and he was sitting weakly on the ground. Besides that, there was a sword against his throat, and Yang Ye was holding its hilt!

Lou Qianxiao lost!

Everyone here was stunned, and it was especially so for the cultivators of Sky Divine Hall!

Lou Qianxiao’s face was ghastly pale, and his eyes were filled with disbelief.

Meanwhile, the Fox Queen and Devil Lion King were in a similar state. Their eyes were filled with disbelief as well.

“At that instant, his strength increased by 30 times at the very least. Moreover, he was actually able to control such powerful strength to such a degree. He... is truly... truly terrifying....”

The Fox Queen nodded in agreement.

Jian Wuchen and the others finally heaved a sigh of relief. But it didn’t take long for them to reveal solemn expressions. Because the situation would definitely become even more difficult to deal with if Yang Ye killed Lou Qianxiao!

...

In the arena, Yang Ye looked up at the white haired old man in midair and said, “I want to see An Nanjing!”

The white haired old man replied, “What if I refuse?”

Hiss!

Lou Qianxiao’s right leg was instantly separated from his body. Lou Qianxiao almost let out a shrill cry, but he forcefully restrained himself. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

The white haired old man’s eyes narrowed slightly while killing intent arose in his eyes.

Yang Ye looked the white haired old man in the eye and said, “Do I have to repeat myself?”

The white haired old man gazed at Yang Ye for a long time before he said, “Bring An Nanjing here!”

It didn’t take long for An Nanjing to arrive.

But at this moment, she didn’t walk out on her own. She was pushed out on a wheelchair. Most importantly, her arms were gone.

Yang Ye was stunned. A moment later, he took Lou Qianxiao with him as he arrived in front of An Nanjing, and then he waved his right hand. A shadowy figure appeared and took control of Lou Qianxiao.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye walked over to her, and she was looking at him as well.

An Nanjing said, “You’re here!”

Yang Ye didn’t say anything. He just squatted down before her, stretched out his hand, and placed it on An Nanjing’s leg. A long time passed before he closed his eyes and spoke with a trembling voice, “Her arms are gone, and her meridians are shattered. All her meridians have been shattered....” A long time passed before Yang Ye opened his eyes, and he gazed at Mu Hanshan who was standing by An Nanjing’s side, “You said that she was fine! You said she was fine!”

Mu Hanshan lowered her head slightly, and she remained silent for a moment before she spoke, “Her physique is unique, and it’s suitable to cultivate the Baleful Yin Energy that Lou Qianxiao needs. However, she refused and even almost killed him. So, Lou Qianxiao’s father, Lou Qianyun, severed her arms, crippled her meridians, and forcefully implanted the cultivation technique that produces Baleful Yin Energy that Lou Qianxiao requires for his cultivation. Today is the day that the Baleful Yin Energy within both of us matures. If you didn’t come, then both of us would be used as furnaces by Lou Qianxiao!”

Mu Hanshan paused for a moment when she spoke up to this point, and then she continued, “Baleful Yin Energy possesses extreme Yin properties. Her life force has been damaged, so she won’t be able to live past today!”

An Nanjing gazed at Yang Ye and spoke softly, “It’s enough that I was able to see you!”

Yang Ye closed his eyes. Quite some time passed before he opened them again, and then he stretched out his hand to touch her cheek lightly while he smiled, “Let’s go home!”
