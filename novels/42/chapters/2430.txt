Chapter 2431 – Madness Intent!

The demon beast’s expression changed drastically when it saw Erya, and it was horrified.

It was naturally afraid of Erya. If it hadn’t been for Huang Tianxing, it would have been beaten up to death that day. Now that it saw Erya again, it was naturally terrified. However, it had no way out right now.

Moreover, it was innately vicious. So, not that it was driven into a corner, it chose to risk everything and fight her to the death.

The vicious aura around it grew even stronger!

Suddenly, Erya leaped over to the demon beast and slammed her fist at it.

Her fist was very small, but the strength within it was huge.

Boom!

Erya’s fist slammed against its head. The demon beast’s head cracked open and blood sprayed from it. Moreover, its entire body cracked open and started bleeding as well!

Bang!

The demon beast was blasted over 10km away!

As soon as it stopped itself, Erya appeared in front of it again. Huang Tianxing frowned slightly and vanished on the spot. However, a ray of sword energy flashed.

Hiss!

The ray of sword energy tore open everything before it, and then an explosion resounded and Huang Tianxing was back to where he’d been a while ago.

He glanced to the right, and Yang Ye was sheathing his sword there.

Meanwhile, shrill cries resounded from the other side. Huang Tianxing looked over, and he saw the black demon beast lying on the ground. Erya was on top of it while her fists rained down upon it.

Every single punch caused a shrill and miserable cry to resound from it. Because every punch caused blood to spray from it!

Every single one caused damage!

Huang Tianxing stared at Erya. This time, he was quite curious about her identity.

He could sense that Erya and the demon beast were both at the Four World Realm, but while they were in the same realm of cultivation, the demon beast was practically incapable of fighting back against her.

Bloodline suppression!

True suppression of the bloodline!

The black demon beast was utterly incapable of fighting back before it.

Huang Tianxing was shocked. The demon beast’s bloodline wasn’t weak at all, and it should be described as quite superior. But that little girl had been able to suppress it with such ease. So, what was she?

Bang!

Suddenly, a miserable howl came from there.

At this moment, it had been beaten up so badly it had returned to its original form. Erya held its head in one hand and dragged it over to Yang Ye. She glanced at Yang Ye and cracked a smile, “Big Brother Yang, it’s mine now.”

Yang Ye nodded.

Once she received his approval, Erya chuckled and then gazed at the black demon beast. Terror filled its eyes when it saw Erya’s gaze, and it started to shudder. It shot a pleading gaze at Huang Tianxing.

Suddenly, Erya stomped down on its stomach, causing it to howl miserably, and then she opened her mouth.

The black demon beast’s expression changed drastically from the sight of this, and its body started trembling even more violently. It was howling madly.

It was begging for mercy!

At this moment, it was visibly begging. It was truly afraid.

However, Erya didn’t show any mercy and bit down.

The demon beast howled with misery.

It was being eaten alive!

Everyone watched as she ate it alive.

She’d really eaten it alive!

Yang Ye remained silent as he watched this.

Was it cruel?

If considered from the perspective of a human, it was. However, if it was considered from the perspective of a demon beast, it wasn’t cruel at all.

Actually, it wasn’t really cruel, even for humans. That’s how society worked. Especially for demon beasts. The strong lived and the weak perished, it was nothing rare or new.

It didn’t take long for Erya to consume the entire demon beast, and a short while passed before she licked her lips while seeming to still be unsatisfied.

Yang Ye spoke softly, “Are you full now?”

She shook her head, “No. But I’m not that hungry anymore. Besides that, its meat wasn’t that tasty, not as tasty as that dragon.”

Yang Ye’s face stiffened, “You’ve tasted that dragon?”

Erya blinked, “No, but it smells pretty good. Right, Big Brother Yang, you should taste the best. Your flesh is really fragrant, extremely even. I want to eat you the most.”

Yang Ye’s face darkened. He hadn’t expected her to actually be thinking about eating him.

Meanwhile, Erya said, “Unfortunately, I can’t eat you. Otherwise, it would be so…”

She licked her lips as she spoke!

Yang Ye knocked Erya’s head lightly, “All you know is to let your thoughts run wild. I’ll smack your butt if you think about eating me again!”

Butt!

Erya showed Yang Ye her tongue and quickly moved behind him.

She was quite respectful when it came to Yang Ye.

Yang Ye rubbed her head and looked into the distance. Huang Ying and the others were still in battle.

Needless to say, Huang Ying and Huang Ye’s strengths were quite shocking to Yang Ye. They were very strong, not any weaker than Xiao Shenwu and that woman from the Eternal Kingdom.

Or it should be said, they weren’t weaker than Yang Ye. If he were to fight any of them, he didn’t have any confidence in being able to win. It would be a 50/50 chance at most!

True geniuses!

The desolate race wasn’t ordinary at all!

Yang Ye moved his gaze away and looked at Huang Tianxing. The latter glanced at Huang Ying and Huang Ye, and then he said, “My Ninth Brother is very ambitious, and very brave!”

He gazed at Yang Ye and continued, “You’re worth becoming friends with. Unfortunately, you have the Sprite Progenitor with you, and it makes others dare not get close to you.”

The Sprite Progenitor!

Yang Ye had the Sprite Progenitor, so it meant that the gazes of countless were focused on him. Anyone who was with Yang Ye would have to face those people too.

Huang Ye didn’t dare to do that, and neither did Huang Tianxing. But Huang Ying did it.

Now, everyone who wanted the Sprite Progenitor was an enemy of Huang Ying and Yang Ye’s.

Yang Ye walked towards Huang Tianxing while holding his sword in hand, “Just cut the crap and attack.”

Huang Tianxing nodded, and then he stretched out his hand. A spear immediately appeared in his grasp, and then he appeared in front of Yang Ye before a speck of cold light stabbed at Yang Ye’s forehead.

It was fast, accurate, and ruthless!

It stabbed straight for Yang Ye’s forehead.

Yang Ye’s sword suddenly left its sheath.

Hiss!

Bang!

Huang Tianxing was blasted over 300m away with his spear! However, Yang Ye was pushed 300m back as well!

As soon as they stopped themselves, Huang Tianxing’s spear cracked into countless pieces.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye took a swift stride forward, and he covered the distance with a single step. After that, a ray of sword energy slashed down from above Huang Tianxing.

Five swings with the Sword Domain!

Five!

Yang Ye had used his full strength as soon as the battle began! He was very well aware that Huang Tianxing wasn’t ordinary at all, and he would be wasting time if he didn’t use his full strength.

As soon as Yang Ye swung those five attacks, Huang Tianxing’s pupils constricted. He sensed danger from this attack!

He didn’t dare to conceal his strength. He bent his knees slightly, pressed his palms together, and then pushed them upward.

Bang!

In an instant, a wave of powerful energy rippled out like an erupting volcano.

The entire world trembled before it!

The strength it contained wasn’t any weaker to Yang Ye’s attack!

They split apart upon coming into contact!

Bang!

The ground below Huang Tianxing’s feet instantly collapsed while he was blasted against a wall over 3km away. The mountain was instantly obliterated, and countless other mountains behind it collapsed instantaneously as well!

Yang Ye wasn’t any better. He was pushed backward repeatedly and only stopped after being pushed over 3km back.

As soon as his figure stopped, a wisp of blood seeped out from the corner of his mouth.

That attack had carried both their full strengths, and it could be considered a head-on collision. So, it was extremely harmful to both of them.

Erya gazed at Huang Tianxing and was about to attack, but Yang Ye stopped her.

She couldn’t join the battle because Huang Tianxing hadn’t used his trump cards yet, and there were many others in the surroundings. If she joined the battle, it was very likely that he would be besieged by them all!

After all, Huang Tianxing and Huang Ye weren’t the only ones who wanted him dead. This was the Hell World, and besides the Hell World, there was Eternal Border and Eternal Kingdom too.

All of them were targeting him at all times.

Huang Tianxing walked out from the rubble. At this moment, he was in a much more terrible state than before. His entire body was covered in blood, and his palms had vanished. Yang Ye’s attack had sliced them both off just now.

Yang Ye’s sword could even destroy Divine Treasures!

Huang Tianxing coughed lightly and walked slowly in Yang Ye’s direction. Every step he took made space tremble before him!

Yang Ye watched as Huang Tianxing’s figure grew larger and larger, and his aura grew increasingly stronger as well!

“Brother Yang! Be careful!” Meanwhile, Huang Ying’s voice resounded in Yang Ye’s mind, “It’s my Desolate Clan’s bloodline. It allows the members of my Desolate Clan to receive a huge increase in strength. My Eldest Brother has awakened 80% of his bloodline, so he’s practically invincible within the Limitbreaker Realm! Be careful!”Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Practically invincible within the Limitbreaker Realm!

Yang Ye looked up at Huang Tianxing, and a fish suddenly descended at him!

Yang Ye swung his sword immediately!

Boom!

An explosion resounded and Yang Ye was blasted over 30km away!

As soon as he stopped himself, another fist slammed down at his head!

Yang Ye’s pupils constricted. He didn’t dare act carelessly and swung his sword with both hands.

Boom!

Yang Ye was blasted away again!

At this moment, Huang Tianxing’s figure was more than two times larger. He took a deep breath in midair and slowly clenched his fists. In an instant, the sky trembled and cracked open.

Huang Tianxing opened his eyes and gazed at Yang Ye, “How weak!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he charged at Yang Ye.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye wiped off the blood on the corner of his mouth, and a ferocious smile curled up on his lips.

Bang!

Suddenly, a wave of powerful energy surged out from within Yang Ye!

In an instant, Yang Ye’s body started to tremble.

Madness intent!

Madness!
