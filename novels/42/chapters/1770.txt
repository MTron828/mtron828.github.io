Chapter 1771 – Spare Us If We Surrender, Alright?

A debt of blood must be repaid with blood!

Why were the Ying Clan and the other clans attacking the Yang Clan? Had the Yang Clan offended them? No! The true reason was their own interests! The Yang Clan was at its weakest state after the internal strife it went through. At this moment, it was the easiest to bully.

Of course, there was another reason.

The Yang Clan had two extraordinary geniuses. If those two extraordinary geniuses were fighting against each other, then they wouldn’t have attacked the Yang Clan. The problem was that those two extraordinary geniuses weren’t fighting and had joined forces instead!

They were afraid!

They were afraid that Yang Ye and Yang Lianshuang would grow. Especially the Ying Clan. Because it wouldn’t be able to maintain its position of overlord in the medium universe if Yang Ye and Yang Lianshuang grew stronger.

Phecda Hall.

At this moment, only Yang Ye and Yang Lianshuang were in the hall.

Yang Lianshuang remained silent for a long time, and then she said, “I received news that 70 True Realm experts will be attacking us tomorrow. We won’t be able to defend Heaven Void Continent.”𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Yang Ye gazed at her, “Shall we die trying?”

She shook her head, “We can’t. It won’t make a difference. Because our strength isn’t able to compete with theirs.”

Yang Ye nodded. Not to mention the Yang Clan in its current state. Even if it was the Yang Clan in the past, it was still incapable of fighting the five clans.

Yang Ye gazed at her, “Tell me what you think we should do.”

Since Yang Lianshuang knew that they wouldn’t be able to defend the continent, she definitely had other ideas.

She replied solemnly, “Retreat.”

Yang Ye shook his head slightly, “We may be able to escape, but the others won’t!”

She shook her head, “We can.”

Yang Ye asked, “How?”

She tapped the ground with her foot, “There’s a teleportation down there. It’s linked to a secret place, and it’s a place our clan found in secret as a precaution to prevent the clan from being annihilated one day.”

She paused for a moment and continued, “Our Yang Clan isn’t the only one that has done this. The other clans have similar escape plans. Prepare for danger in times of peace. No clan can thrive forever. When disaster comes, such escape plans are the final hope of a clan!”

Yang Ye replied, “Are you willing to just leave like that?”

She smiled, “It doesn’t matter. After all, we’ll come back, right? Moreover, it isn’t a bad thing for us.”

Yang Ye asked, “Why?”

She replied, “Have you noticed that the Yang Clan is even more united than any other moment in history. Moreover, it’s an opportunity for us. An opportunity to grow and develop well. Because if we stay in the medium universe of the Milky Way System, the other clans will definitely act against us. But once we go into hiding, we’ll be able to grow and develop properly.”

She gazed at Yang Ye at this point, “Let me ask you something. Do you think the eight clans really are the strongest in the medium universe?”

Yang Ye frowned slightly, “What are you trying to say?”

Yang Lianshuang chuckled, “Many people think that the eight clans are the strongest powers in the medium universe, but that’s not true. There are some mysterious powers, and they aren’t weaker to the eight clans. They may even be stronger. For example, Moment Mountain, or the Secret Sect….”

“The Secret Sect!” Yang Ye’s expression changed slightly, “You know about the Secret Sect?”

A wisp of surprise flashed through Yang Lianshuang’s eyes, “You know about the Secret Sect too?”

Yang Ye nodded, “They came looking for me.”

She asked, “They wanted you to join them?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “They wanted you to join them?”

She nodded slightly, “According to my knowledge, I’m not the only one. So long as you have potential and natural talent, they’ll come for you. However, they only choose monstrous geniuses with extraordinary natural talent and potential.”

Yang Ye said, “In other words, many geniuses on the Milky Way Rankings may have joined the Secret Sect?”

“The Milky Way Rankings?” A wisp of ridicule curled up on the corners of Yang Lianshuang’s mouth, “The Milky Way Rankings is for children. True experts don’t need a ranking to prove themselves. For example, you’re not on the rankings, but would anyone dare to say that you’re weak?”

Yang Ye chuckled, “For children…. If those geniuses heard what you just said, they would probably be angered to the point of spitting out blood!”

“It’s a fact!” She spoke indifferently, “But that fellow ranked at the top of the Milky Way Rankings has some ability.”

Yang Ye asked, “The first? You know who it is?”

Yang Lianshuang nodded, “I’ve met that fellow. He should have joined the Secret Sect by now.” She shook her head at this point and continued, “Let’s stop here. We have to make the best use of our time to send away everyone in Phecda City!”

Yang Ye spoke solemnly, “There’ll be too much movement! They’ll notice what we’re doing!”

Yang Lianshuang replied, “I know. So, I need your help!”

Yang Ye asked, “What do you mean?”

She looked up at the sky, “Cause trouble. The greater the better. Make them place all their focus on you. You don’t have to do it for long. Just four hours will be enough. You can leave once four hours are up.”

Yang Ye fell silent for a long time, and then he said, “Leaving represents abandoning everything the Yang Clan has…. Are you really willing to do that?”

“It’s better than letting everyone die!” She continued, “We still have hope while we’re alive; but everything will be meaningless if we’re dead.”

Yang Ye nodded, “I understand. Leave the rest to me!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he turned around with the intent to leave. Meanwhile, Yang Lianshuang said, “Thank you.”

Yang Ye turned around to look at her, and he smiled, “When did you become so polite?”

She shook her head slightly, “I wouldn’t have been able to manage the entire clan without you.”

Yang Ye smiled, “So, how are you going to thank me?”

Yang Lianshuang chuckled, “I’ve really never given that any thought. Because there doesn’t seem to be anything in the Yang Clan that you would want.”

Yang Ye chuckled, “Actually, there’s no need to thank me. Because I’m a part of the Yang Clan now. Moreover, even if I’m not part of the Yang Clan, we’re still friends. There’s no need for words of thanks between friends. Right?”

She gazed at him for a long time before she smiled, “I suddenly realized that you’re actually really easy to get along with.”

Yang Ye smiled. He didn’t say another word and just vanished from the hall.

Once Yang Ye vanished, the defensive formation around Phecda City was immediately activated.

Countless strands of spirit energy shot up into the air. In the end, all of it entered the barrier of light in the sky. At the same time, countless voices resounded from Phecda City.

“Fight to the death!”

Fight to the death!”

At this moment, 70 True Realm experts were looking down at the continent from space.

Lu Yuntian spoke solemnly as he stood behind Ying Qing, “Should we attack?”

Ying Qing nodded slightly. He was just about to speak when he suddenly looked towards the distance. Space there trembled slightly, and then Yang Ye appeared before them!

Yang Ye!

Their expressions changed slightly when they saw him, and their eyes were filled with vigilance.

Even though they had 70 True Realm experts on their side, they didn’t dare to act carelessly against Yang Ye or underestimate him. Because no one knew what he was planning.

There was vigilance in Ying Qing’s eyes too. Since Yang Ye dared to come here on his own, Yang Ye definitely had something to rely on. Or it should be said that Yang Ye planned to wreak havoc again.

Yang Ye glanced at them. Needless to say, he wasn’t very confident right now.

70 True Realm experts!

Not to mention fighting them, just their auras would probably be sufficient to crush him. However, he couldn’t shrink back no matter what!

Because he had to buy time for Yang Lianshuang, the members of the Yang Clan, and his loved ones!

They were counting on him to evacuate safely!

Yang Ye took a deep breath, and then he gazed at Ying Qing and smiled, “Hello, patriarch of the Ying Clan. Hello, patriarchs of the various clans. Hello everyone!”

All of them felt speechless.

Needless to say, they were quite stunned right now.

Ying Qing stared at Yang Ye, “Yang Ye, what are you up to now?”

Yang Ye chuckled with embarrassment and said, “I’m here to discuss something with all of you. I think enmity will never end if enmity is answered with enmity. So, why don’t we sit down, have some tea, and forget everything unhappy that has happened between us, alright?”

They had strange expressions on their faces when they heard him. What is he trying to do?

Meanwhile, Ying Qing spoke in a low voice, “Yang Ye, do you think that’s possible?”

“Why not?” Yang Ye hurriedly said, “There are no impassable ravines. We can just sit together and laugh off the enmity between us!”

Ying Qing stared at Yang Ye, “What the heck do you want?!”

Yang Ye was about to speak when Lu Yuntian suddenly said, “Brother Ying, I think he might be buying time!”

Everyone’s expressions changed slightly when they heard this, and then they looked down at Heaven Void Continent. Right when they were about to think of a certain possibility, Yang Ye suddenly drew his sword, and the sword howl instantly drew their attention back to Yang Ye.

Yang Ye pointed his sword at Ying Qing, “Since all of you refuse to give us a chance to live, then my Yang Clan will take you down with us!”

“Take us down with you?” Ying Qing laughed coldly, “Yang Ye, do you think the Yang Clan’s current strength is even capable of doing that?”

Yang Ye fell silent for a moment and replied, “Spare us if we surrender, alright?”

All of them were stunned again. This fellow wants to surrender?

Are we hearing things?

The insufferably arrogant Yang Ye actually wants to surrender?

Suddenly, Lu Yuntian said, “He’s definitely buying time! Something is happening down there!”

Ying Qing’s eyes narrowed slightly when he heard Lu Yuntian. He didn’t waste his breath on Yang Ye and waved his right hand, “Patriarchs, fight Yang Ye with me. Everyone else, head down there!”

Suddenly, Yang Ye tore off the talisman on his right arm, and then the wooden sword appeared in his right hand. He looked up at Ying Qing and the others, “It’s best if you don’t go down there!”

Ying Qing stared at Yang Ye, “What if we insist?”

Suddenly, Ying Qing and the others’ expressions changed, and then the head of a nearby True Realm expert flew up into the air.

All of them were shocked by this!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye’s indifferent voice resounded, “Why don’t you give it a try?”
