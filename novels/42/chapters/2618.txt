Chapter 2619 – Destroy This World!

She’d fought someone!

Everyone gazed at Qi Bitian!

The young girl who’d almost destroyed the Origin World that day was here again!

She was back!

All of them acted like they were facing a formidable enemy!

Of course, they were prepared for the worst!

Qi Bitian gazed at Erya and Snowy. She grinned when she saw Erya, walked over to Erya, and said, “I’m Qi Bitian, you helped me in the past!”

Erya gazed at Qi Bitian for a long time and shook her head, “I don’t know you. But can you help me?”

Qi Bitian nodded, “Of course! After all, you’re the only one who dared to help me at that time!”

Erya gazed at Snowy, “Save her!”

Save Snowy!

It was Erya’s only request!

Qi Bitian gazed at Snowy. She was stunned when she saw Snowy, and then she smiled!

She was smiling!

No one knew what this smile meant!

Meanwhile, she glanced at the sky, and her smile grew wider, “You know… you’re severed your only way out of this! If she remains unharmed, then perhaps you would have a chance to live. Because that existence won’t just watch as I do as I please. Yet now, I can promise you that even if I let you go, that existence may not do the same.”

The Divine Abode’s Master shook his head slightly, “The Desolate Emperor killed a Sprite Progenitor in the past, but isn’t he all fine and well now?”

Qi Bitian looked to the right. The Desolate Emperor was standing there!

Qi Bitian scanned the Desolate Emperor, and the latter nodded slightly as a form of greeting!

Qi Bitian moved her gaze away and looked at the Divine Abode’s Master, “To think you’re from the same era as me. Yet you can’t even discern something like this.”

She raised her left hand slightly.

Hiss!

The mysterious energy that trapped Erya and the others instantly vanished without a trace!

Snowy immediately flew into Yang Ye’s arms. She didn’t cry and just held him tightly.

She had been really, really afraid!

Yang Ye gently rubbed Snowy’s head. While he looked extremely calm, the desire to kill in his mind was surging!

Qi Bitian gazed at Erya and Yang Ye, “Leave this place!”

Yang Ye shook his head.

Leave?

No!

He refused to leave!

He had many, many things to do!

Erya shook her head too. She glanced at the surroundings and said, “I think all of them deserve death!”

Qi Bitian shook her head, “You’re not who you used to be. You don’t have the strength to do that.”

She gazed at Yang Ye and continued, “Take them and leave. Don’t be rash!”

Yang Ye shook his head again!

Rash?

He planned to be truly rash this time!

Yang Ye gazed at Erya, and the latter shook her head, “Big Brother Yang, I refuse.”

Erya immediately appeared on the bridge once she finished speaking.

A ferocious grin curled up on her mouth. No, it should be called vicious instead. A moment later, she slammed her fists at the bridge below her!

Destroy the bridge!

The Desolate Emperor gazed at Erya. At this moment, she was emanating a vicious aura! No, it wasn’t just vicious, it was evil!

Many others noticed it as well!

Qi Bitian glanced at Erya, “Releasing your nature…? That’s fine too!”

She gazed at Yang Ye, “Are you sure you refuse to leave?”

Yang Ye nodded.

Qi Bitian nodded slightly, “Then take care!”

As soon as she finished speaking, she gazed at the Divine Abode’s Master, “Looks like that little Sprite Progenitor and him aren’t your only targets today, I’m one too. Right, I’m here now, so bring it!”

Four powerful auras suddenly appeared behind the Divine Abode’s Master!

Every one one of them wasn’t inferior to him!

Qi Bitian glanced at them and shook her head, “Just that? That isn’t enough at all!”

“What if you include me too?” Suddenly, a voice resounded from Qi Bitian’s right.

A short moment later, an old man in plain robes appeared above the Boundless Water!

He just stood there above the water!

“Shui Wubian!” The Desolate Emperor suddenly chuckled, “What are you doing out of your Boundless Water?”Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

The old man glanced at the Desolate Emperor, “That’s none of your business.”

The Desolate Emperor smiled and did not get angry. He gazed at Qi Bitian and said, “Shui Wubian is the spirit of the Boundless Water, a true old geezer. Right, let me introduce the rest. Besides him, there’s the Divine Abode’s Master, the Eternal Lord, the Soul Sect’s Master, and Mr. Jing. Mr. Jing is quite mysterious, and he should be from the same era as you.”

He glanced at the space on the right, “As for this one hiding in space, I don’t know who that is. Tsk, tsk. This aura is really quite strong! Haha…”

The smile on the Desolate Emperor’s face was growing wider.

Because the entire incident was growing increasingly interesting.

Shui Wubian gazed at Qi Bitian, “You’re not from this era, so why go against us?”

Actually, the alliance formed between the experts of this world and the emergence of some mysterious experts was very understandable. It was because Qi Bitian’s arrival may spell the end of this entire world!

All those who didn’t wish to see the Origin World destroyed and had the strength to stop it would show themselves!

The Origin World’s strength was far greater than this!

Especially now that Qi Bitian was clearly injured!

Qi Bitian soared up slowly into the air. Countless auras instantly locked onto the area around her. At the same time, a mysterious barrier appeared above her. It was clearly the work of the Origin World!

However, along with a lift push of her left palm, the barrier vanished without a trace!

Meanwhile, Shui Wubian suddenly said, “Let me try her first!”

He suddenly closed his eyes!

Boom!

A moment later, the Boundless Water below surged, and then a huge water dragon charged out of the water!

A powerful wave of pressure surged through the area!

Qi Bitian tapped her right foot down.

Bang!

The entire sky shook violently while the huge water dragon was stopped on the spot!

The dragon roared hysterically while waves of powerful dragon pressure surged madly at Qi Bitian.

Qi Bitian smiled with ridicule, “Weak!”

She tapped her right foot down again.

Boom!

The huge dragon instantly exploded apart and countless pearls of water rain down from above!

Meanwhile, Shui Wubian raised his right hand.

The sky suddenly fell silent!

The water droplets floated soundlessly in the air, and then they started spinning rapidly, causing waves of powerful energy to appear around Qi Bitian.

Qi Bitian glanced at the surroundings, “A Water Domain cultivated with the help of Boundless Water. It’s not bad indeed. No wonder you dared to face me. However, you’re still too young!”

She clenched her left fist.

Hiss!

The space around her cracked open, and then the space in around 3km around her just vanished without a trace. The countless droplets of water vanished along with the space!

Shui Wubian frowned at the sight of this!

They had been wiped out of existence!

His Water Domain and the Boundless Water had been instantly eliminated! They’d been eliminated along with the space here too!

Shui Wubian stared at Qi Bitian yet refused to stop. A moment later, the Water Domain condensed into form again, but as soon as it did, it was obliterated by a strand of mysterious energy!

Obliterating Domains!

At this moment, Shui Wubian was truly shocked!

In all his years, he’d never met anyone capable of forcefully obliterating his Domain!

Shui Wubian stared at Qi Bitian, “What is that ability of yours?!”

Qi Bitian suddenly raised her left hand in Shui Wubian’s direction, causing the latter to be shocked. A moment later, countless waves appeared around him. These waves were made of Boundless Water, and it could be said that with the Water Domain there to enhance them, these waves weren’t any inferior to Super Divine Treasures!

However, along with the descent of Qi Bitian’s attack, the Boundless Water around Shui Wubian started to explode apart inch by inch!

Boom!

An instant later, the Boundless Water around Shui Wubian was obliterated, and Shui Wubian himself was blasted away out of everyone’s fields of vision.

Qi Bitian lowered her hand and glanced at the surroundings, “Next? Or how about all of you join forces?”

“As expected of someone who even Destiny must hunt!” Meanwhile, a middle aged man with a crown on his head appeared before Qi Bitian.

He was the man the Desolate Emperor had introduced earlier, Mr. Jing!

As for his background, it was a mystery. Even the others in the Origin World weren’t aware of it, and all they did know was that he was part of the Origin World.

Qi Bitian gazed at Mr. Jing, sized him up, and then looked at Yang Ye, “I can’t use my full strength, and I can’t stay here for too long either. If you don’t leave now… What are you waiting for? Hurry up and kill!”

Yang Ye glanced at her and gazed at An Nanjing. The latter clenched her fists, “I’ll annihilate this world with you.”

Yang Ye roared with laughter, “Good! Alright!”

As soon as he finished speaking, his figure shot toward the distance.

At this moment, a wave of monstrous slaughter intent appeared.

Kill!

The Origin World wanted Snowy to repair this world, but as far as Yang Ye was concerned, anyone who dared to harm Snowy had to pay a hundredfold!

Monstrous slaughter intent swept toward the surroundings!

Meanwhile, Erya was still hammering the bridge madly!

Erya’s face was icy cold, and the evil and vicious aura she emanated was growing denser… At the same time, the box within Qi Bitian’s bamboo house started to tremble.

Snowy returned to the Primordial Pagoda and went to the Ascension Platform.

She sat on it and closed her eyes slowly while clenching her paws. A long time passed before her lips parted a little. While she didn’t make a sound, but based on the way her mouth had moved, she should have said—Xiu!

Xiu!
