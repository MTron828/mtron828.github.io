Chapter 2501 – Just Save it!

Yang Ye was never afraid of trouble!

Just like that, Yang Ye went to the ground floor, and he saw a middle aged man. The man was seated before a table, and he gestured for Yang Ye to have a seat upon seeing Yang Ye.

Yang Ye sat before him and asked, “Are you here to reason with me?”

“Reason with you?” The middle aged man smiled, “What is that? Is it edible?”

Yang Ye said, “Then I’ll just be frank! If you want to talk, I’ll talk; if you want to fight, I can fight you at any time. Moreover, I’ll accompany you until the end. So, you choose if we talk or fight!”

The middle aged man smiled, “You’re very confident!”

Yang Ye said, “Cut the crap, it’s pointless! Just give me an answer!”

The middle aged man gazed at Yang Ye for a long time and said, “You openly killed members of my Leng Clan at the city’s entrance, and many powers witnessed it. My Leng Clan would lose face if we just let it be!”

Yang Ye frowned slightly, “The Leng Clan?”

The middle aged man nodded and smiled, “You’ve heard of my clan, right?”

Yang Ye nodded, “I have.”

The middle aged man glanced at him, “Then which power do you belong to?”

Yang Ye smiled, “I’m just an independent cultivator without any background. So, feel free to act against me.”

The middle aged man’s gaze gradually turned icy cold.

Yang Ye was being too domineering!

At this moment, the middle aged man had the desire to kill. Even the nicest person had a temper, and the way Yang Ye was acting felt more than just plain arrogance.

It was disdain!

Disdain to the Leng Clan!

As soon as he thought of this, the middle aged man stood up, “If that’s the case, allow me to have a spar with you!”

As he spoke, he glanced at the old man behind the counter, “Elder Xing, lend me the Void Space here!”

The old man replied indifferently, “One World Crystal!”

The middle aged man smiled and flicked one to the old man.

Once the old man took the World crystal, he waved his right hand. In an instant, the space before Yang Ye and the middle aged man trembled slightly. A short while later, they vanished on the spot, and they were inside an expanse of ethereal space when they appeared once more.

The middle aged man gazed at Yang Ye and raised his hands slightly, causing a powerful aura to ripple out from him.𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

The Four World Realm!

A peak Four World Realm expert!

The middle aged man gazed at Yang Ye, “No matter who you are or which power you’re from, since you dared…”

Yang Ye suddenly said, “Just save it!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye vanished on the spot, and a ray of sword energy flashed.

The middle aged man’s pupils constricted at the sight of it.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye was behind the middle aged man.

The middle aged man stared blankly ahead. That attack had been too, too swift. It was so swift that he’d only reacted when it sliced his throat open.

What a strong sword cultivator!

That was his final thought!

Yang Ye waved his right hand, and the middle aged man’s spatial ring descended into his palm. There were 10 World Crystals within it!

He'd obtained some good gains!

Yang Ye put it away and looked up, “Can you end it now?”

A moment of silence ensued, and then space changed. A short while later, Yang Ye returned to where he’d been.

The middle aged man’s head had vanished, but the man’s body was still seated there.

Yang Ye raised his cup and took a small sip of tea, “It’s a little bitter!”

He stood up and walked off to his room.

Elder Xing glanced at Yang Ye and said, “Emerald, clean it up!”

A woman walked over. It was the same woman who’d welcomed Yang Ye into the hotel earlier. She walked over to the middle aged man’s corpse.

“Send it to the Leng Clan!” Elder Xing said, “Remember to ask for 1 World Crystal as the transportation fees!”

Emerald nodded slightly, and then she left with the corpse.

Elder Xing closed his eyes slowly while Yang Ye’s attack flashed within his mind!

A long time passed before Elder Xing spoke abruptly, “Very fast!”

…

Yang Ye returned to his room and entered the Primordial Pagoda.

As he recalled the previous battle, Yang Ye felt that he was lacking in many aspects. While he’d killed the middle aged man in an instant, he felt like it lacked something.

“Belief!” Meanwhile, Sword Scroll appeared before him, “Your belief wasn’t strong or firm enough. Deep within your heart, you think you may not be able to kill a peak Four World Realm expert with a single attack. That little bit of doubt deep in your heart made your sword incapable of reaching your limits.”

Belief!

Yang Ye came to a sudden understanding.

Just as she’d said, his belief hadn’t been firm enough when he attacked earlier! Even if he couldn’t kill a Four World Realm expert with a single attack, since he was bound to attack, he should have the belief that he was unmatched!

His sword had to kill!

Actually, even an ordinary person had such belief. Just like how many people would erupt with boundless strength in a hopeless situation. It was because they were unafraid of death and only sought to survive!

It was their belief!

Meanwhile, Sword Scroll suddenly said, “If you have nothing else to do, it’s best if you leave soon!”

Yang Ye was quite puzzled, “Why?”

She replied indifferently, “You’re too aggressive. So, staying for long isn’t a good thing for you!”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and nodded, “I won’t stay for too long. I’ll leave once I’ve figured out the overall strength of the experts here.”

Sword Scroll asked, “For the desolate race?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “Based on their strength, they can forget about the war if they can’t even figure out the Eternal Kingdom’s strength in the War Dimension. I’m doing this for myself. I’m sure you’ve noticed how determined Eternal Kingdom is to obtain Snowy. I must be prepared for the worst, so getting to know Eternal Kingdom a little better will be very beneficial to me!”

She thought for a moment and nodded, “Try not to stay for too long!”

She was really quite worried!

Yang Ye’s temper was a little too hot, and the consequences of conflict here were very serious.

After that, Yang Ye kept polishing his Sword Domain and flying swords. Especially the flying swords, they could be described as being absolutely elusive within his Sword Domain!

Even Sword Scroll was full of praise toward his attainments in the flying swords!

Now, his body was about to hit the Two World Realm. So long as that happened, his cultivation could rise with it. At that time, his strength would improve tremendously as well.

Suddenly, Yang Ye left the Primordial Pagoda. His door was being knocked.

Yang Ye said, “Come in!”

It was Emerald who opened the door.

She glanced at him and said, “Young Master Ye, an underground trade meeting is happening here. Are you interested in having a look?”

“An underground trade meeting?” Yang Ye asked, “Will there be Super Divine Treasures?”

Her face stiffened.

Super Divine Treasures?

She glanced at him suspiciously and wondered if there was something wrong with him in the head!

After all, even Eternal Kingdom probably had no more than 10 Super Divine Treasures. All of them were in the hands of extraordinary powers, so how could they possibly sell them?

Yang Ye asked, “If there are no Super Divine Treasures, then what about Divine Treasures?”

She thought for a moment and replied, “Divine Treasures are sold from time to time. It depends on your luck.”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and replied, “Then let’s go have a look!”

Meanwhile, Emerald said, “Young Master Ye, you must prove you possess sufficient wealth before you’ll be allowed entrance. The requirement is 50 World Crystals!”

Yang Ye glanced at her, “So, you’re not a shady hotel, right? You’re not trying to trick me and rob me once I go where you want, right?”

Her face darkened, “Young Master Ye, you can go ask about our reputation. We’ve been in business for a long time.”

Yang Ye smiled embarrassedly, “Sorry, I’ve just encountered too many of them, so I’m quite afraid now.”

Emerald nodded slightly, “Your worries are normal. However, the House of Indulgence never does that. Right, if you’re planning to go, please prove that you possess 50 World Crystals or you can use other things like Divine Treasures to prove your wealth as well.”

Yang Ye waved his right hand and 50 World Crystals appeared before him.

Yang Ye smiled, “Are these enough?”

She glanced at him, “They are! Please come with me!”

Yang Ye followed her underground. Or to be more precise, they entered an underground passageway that was quite wide but not very long.

Everyone here wore a black robe, and their auras were restrained. No one knew each other’s identity!

Yang Ye wore a black robe as Emerald suggested. According to her, many people did business here because their treasures couldn’t be sold out in the open!

For example, treasures obtained by robbing and killing!

Once she led Yang Ye here, Emerald turned around and left. This wasn’t a place that she could stay at. She took a World Crystal from Yang Ye as the entrance fee before leaving!

At this moment, Yang Ye realized that he could only be considered to be a poor man. These people who were doing business here were the real wealthy people!

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts and glanced at the surroundings. There weren’t many people here, just around 30. Moreover, people were leaving from time to time. But more were coming from above as well.

Besides that, the street was very quiet, almost perfectly silent.

A short while passed before Yang Ye walked over to a nearby black robed figure. There was a white jade plate in front of the black robed figure, and there was a faint white light coiled around the jade plate.

A Pseudo Divine Treasure!

Yang Ye shook his head and wasn’t interested in it. So, he walked over to the next black robed figure. There was a dagger in front of this black robed man. It was very short, but it was very sharp too!

However, it was a Pseudo Divine Treasure too!

A dagger like that would be instantly obliterated from just touching Executor!

Yang Ye shook his head and continued. However, he didn’t notice anything good after taking a look at a few stalls.

He was quite disappointed!

Yang Ye shook his head and was about to leave when Sword Scroll’s voice resounded in his mind, “Second one to the left.”

Yang Ye stopped when he heard her and looked over to that stall. There was a fist-sized pearl before the black robed figure there.

An inner core!

Sword Scroll spoke abruptly, “It’s an inner core from a Lord Realm demon beast!”

Yang Ye’s eyes lit up!
