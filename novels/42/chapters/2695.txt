Chapter 2696 – A Formidable Sword Cultivator!

Yang Ye’s expression was extremely unsightly right now!

The owner of Heaven Executor, Tu, had said that he was her successor!

Fuck!

Just the thought of it was terrifying!

Because Tu had many countless enemies in the past! The most terrifying part was those she hadn’t killed or wasn’t able to kill… It was very likely for them to come for him!

Moreover, besides her, the enemies of the other forms of Destiny may come for him as well!

Destiny was the number one enemy in the hearts of countless cultivators throughout the universe!

After all, didn’t the End World establish a Defiance Alliance?

What was the Defiance Alliance trying to defy? It was definitely Destiny!

Now, Tu called him her successor. Fuck! That was like pushing him into a deathtrap!

Because while these people may not dare to go looking for her, they would definitely not fear him!

Revenge!

She was getting revenge!

What a vile woman!

What a shameless woman!

Yang Ye was full of hatred!

Meanwhile, the middle aged man suddenly said, “Destiny chose you, right?”

Yang Ye gazed at the middle aged man and said, “Would you believe me if I said that I wasn’t related to her at all?”

The middle aged man shook his head, “I wouldn’t.”

He waved his hands once he finished speaking, “Obliterate!”

In an instant, the space around Yang Ye exploded apart, inch by inch.

It was like a huge explosion!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye vanished on the spot.

Hiss!

A ray of sword energy sliced through space!

A head-on collision!

A short while later, the sword energy sliced through everything and arrived before the middle aged man. Meanwhile, the man pressed his palms together.

He caught Yang Ye’s sword between his palms!

Yang Ye’s sword couldn’t move an inch forward!

Suddenly, Yang Ye released Past Life, and then he pushed forward while another sword appeared in his left grasp!

Great Unknown!

Once he got close to the middle aged man, Yang Ye launched a horizontal slash!

The middle aged man’s expression changed slightly. He didn’t dare to go head-on against Yang Ye’s attack. He released his grip and retreated.

But as soon as he did that, not only was he unable to create distance with Yang Ye, the latter even got closer to him.

Two swords descended!

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!

The sound of slicing resounded incessantly. Every swing of Yang Ye’s swords could slice through space with ease. The middle aged man had no choice but to go head-on against every one of them, and in just a few breaths of time, he’d been pushed over 30km back!

Meanwhile, the middle aged man started to counterattack.

Bam!

Yang Ye was suddenly pushed 1km back!

Yang Ye stopped himself stably and looked up. There was a huge saber in the middle aged man’s grasp.

A saber cultivator!

Yang Ye tightened his grip on his swords and didn’t dare be careless.

Since the man before him could survive Tu, he was absolutely not an ordinary expert.

Of course, Yang Ye didn’t fear the man either!

The middle aged man glanced at the injuries on him, and then he looked up at Yang Ye, “As expected of someone chosen by Destiny. You have some skill.”

He suddenly leaped up into the air and slashed down at Yang Ye with both hands.

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly. This saber attack was unlike Zuo Mu’s. The man was a strength-type saber cultivator, and he used pure overwhelming strength to crush everything before him!

Yang Ye closed his eyes slowly, and then he swung his sword.

It stabbed against the tip of the saber.

The sword and saber trembled!

After a moment, Yang Ye’s sword moved slightly to the side, allowing the man’s saber to descend straight down at him!

However, it didn’t have the aura and strength it carried a moment ago. Yang Ye’s attack had interrupted and canceled it out!

At the moment Yang Ye’s sword moved to the side, the middle aged man’s expression changed drastically, and he immediately retreated. However, it was still a little too late, and his left hand flew into the air!

Yang Ye sheathed his sword!

He looked up at the middle aged man with indifference!~ Actually, he was quite shocked. If the middle aged man’s saber had descended, the middle aged man would definitely die. After all, the strength in the saber had been completely canceled out, so it could be said that Yang Ye was entirely capable of resisting it with just his physical defenses. However, his sword’s strength was still there. Thus, if the middle aged man chose to let the saber continue its descent…

The middle aged man would definitely suffer.

Striking last to subdue the enemy!

It was a technique he’d comprehended in the World of Past Life. Even though it wasn’t that useful against the woman in black or Tu, existences like them… were very rare in the world!

The middle aged man glanced at Yang Ye and laughed coldly, “What a formidable sword cultivator.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he shot up into the air with his saber in hand, and then a huge 300 meter-long wave of sword energy slashed down from the sky.

Yang Ye didn’t even look up as he stabbed his sword upward.

Bang!

The saber energy instantly collapsed, but just a moment later, a saber appeared above Yang Ye.

It was the middle aged man!

Yang Ye pulled his sword back and didn’t attack. The saber was getting closer and closer, and it was so close that the space around him had already been obliterated.

However, Yang Ye still didn’t react.

Finally, the saber arrived above his head.

At this moment, Yang Ye suddenly turned around, drew his sword, and stabbed.

The saber descended by Yang Ye’s nose, and his sword…

Hiss!

It stabbed through the middle aged man.

An instant later, right when Yang Ye was about to attack again, a ray of silver light suddenly appeared before him!

Another strand of saber energy!

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly. He didn’t dare to act carelessly, and ignored the middle aged man behind him as he stabbed his sword forward.

Bang!

The silver light shattered and Yang Ye retreated around 10m back!

Meanwhile, the middle aged man behind him seized the opportunity to move over 1km away!

Yang Ye ignored the middle aged man and looked into the distance. A man was walking over slowly from there!

Zuo Mu!

The End World was here again!

Yang Ye frowned slightly because the End World just refused to give up on killing him!

Zuo Mu glanced at the middle aged man, “You can go recuperate in the End World.”

The middle aged man glanced at Zuo Mu, “You’re Zuo Mu.”

Zuo Mu nodded slightly, “You must be the Sky Saber, right?”

The middle aged man nodded.

Zuo Mu spoke softly, “I’ve always wanted to meet you!”

Sky Saber shook his head, “I’m inferior to you.”

He glanced at Yang Ye at this point, “I didn’t expect to even be incapable of fighting her successor. Haha, how sad!”

Yang Ye glanced at Sky Saber. He really wanted to say that it had nothing to do with him, but Yang Ye didn’t say anything in the end. While there was no link between him and Tu, he did have a link with the women in white and black!

Meanwhile, Zuo Mu glanced at Sky Saber and said, “He’s no ordinary person. You don’t have to take it to heart.”

Sky Saber didn’t say anything and just left!

Yang Ye gazed at Zuo Mu, “Shall we spar?”

Zuo Mu nodded slightly, “We shall!”

He suddenly drew his saber and swung it.

Hiss!

A pitch black line appeared in the space between them.Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Meanwhile, Yang Ye drew his sword.

A very ordinary and swift stab!

A strand of cold light suddenly flickered on the tip of Yang Ye’s sword.

The cold light was Zuo Mu’s saber energy!

Yang Ye’s sword gradually started to tremble violently!

Boom!

A moment of silence ensued, and then the cold light vanished, but Yang Ye was pushed around 100m back!

Meanwhile, Zuo Mu transformed into a string of afterimages that vanished on the spot.

Yang Ye’s pupils constricted, and then he drew his sword and swung it repeatedly!

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!

Each swing was stronger than the last! And faster than the last!

However, every swing he completed was accompanied by him moving around 30m back. Just like that, Yang Ye retreated around 300m back before he finally stopped himself.

Meanwhile, Zuo Mu was where he’d been a moment ago!

Yang Ye glanced at Past Life, and it was still trembling.

He fell silent for a moment, and then he cracked a smile, “Take one of my attacks too!”

Yang Ye was in front of Zuo Mu when he finished speaking.

His sword descended!

Striking first!

It locked down all of the possible moves Zuo Mu could make!

Zuo Mu frowned slightly, and a solemn expression appeared in his eyes for the first time.

An instant later, he drew his saber and swung it.

He chose to fight speed with speed and strength with strength!

It was his advantage!

The saber and sword collided directly against each other.

Bang!

The space around them instantly collapsed. At the same time, Yang Ye was pushed 300m back while Zuo Mu was pushed around 100m back too.

Zuo Mu glanced at Yang Ye, and there was a wisp of fear in his eyes!

Yang Ye’s speed of growth was too insane!

Now, even if he fought Yang Ye one-on-one, he had no confidence in being able to kill Yang Ye!

But he’d been able to completely crush Yang Ye in the past!

How long had it been?

Zuo Mu sheathed his saber and said, “The spar is done!”

He turned around and left!

Yang Ye didn’t attack again either. Because he couldn’t kill Zuo Mu either.

Zuo Mu was stronger than he’d expected!

Zuo Mu’s speed and strength was superior to his own!

Even if he risked his life, he still wasn’t very confident in being able to beat Zuo Mu!

Meanwhile, Zuo Mu had vanished.

Yang Ye was about to leave when the transmission stone in his possession trembled. Yang Ye withdrew it, and a voice came from within, “You’re in trouble now!”

Yang Ye asked, “What is it?”

The voice replied solemnly, “One of the forms of Destiny said that you’re her successor, and you’ll be in charge of killing Destiny Realm experts from now on!”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

The voice continued, “Besides that, the End World has been spreading it. So, everyone throughout the Three Dimensional Universe is aware that you’re a successor of Destiny. Some old geezers, those geezers who once managed to escape Destiny… They may be no match for Destiny, but they may come for you instead… So, are you ready?”

Yang Ye’s face was utterly dark! Ready my ass!
