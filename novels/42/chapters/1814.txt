Chapter 1815 – I’m Yang Ye!

Pu!

Meanwhile, a mouthful of blood sprayed from Yang Ye. But he’d grabbed onto Ye Mo’s right arm. Or to be more precise, he’d grabbed the Ancient Spirit Python’s soul.

Ye Mo was stunned, and then he intended to blast Yang Ye away. However, a wave of suction force suddenly surged out from Yang Ye’s chest, and then the python’s soul instantly vanished from Ye Mo’s arm.

A moment later, Yang Ye clenched his left fist and slammed it forward.

Boom!

An explosion resounded and Ye Mo was blasted over 300m away!

Everyone here was shocked!

Who is that black robed fellow?

Meanwhile, Ye Mo had a ferocious expression on his face, but there was even more panic on it. Because he noticed that he’d actually been cut off from the Ancient Spirit Python.

It was his strongest trump card!

Yet now, it was gone!

Ye Mo stared at Yang Ye, “Hand it over!”

Yang Ye glanced at Ye Mo and said, “Wait a minute!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he closed his eyes and immersed his consciousness into the Primordial Pagoda!

Within the Primordial Pagoda.

After the Ancient Spirit Python entered the Primordial Pagoda, it glanced at the surroundings with a lost expression in its eyes. A moment later, viciousness filled its eyes, and it roared furiously into the sky. In an instant, the surrounding space rippled violently from the force within its roar.

Meanwhile, Qiong Qi, Hou Qing, and Snowy, who was holding the wooden sword, were standing nearby.

Snowy blinked as she gazed at the new python, and then she knocked Qiong Qi’s wing lightly with the wooden sword. After that, she pointed at the Ancient Spirit Python and seemed to be asking who that was.

Qiong Qi glanced at Snowy and replied, “An unlucky bastard!”

Snowy blinked, and then she pointed at Hou Qing. She seemed to be asking if it was just like Hou Qing!

The corners of Hou Qing’s mouth twitched at the sight of this. That little fellow….

Qiong Qi, on the other hand, couldn’t help but start roaring with laughter.

Meanwhile, the python was still swinging its tail through the air, and the powerful force it carried caused space to tremble.

Qiong Qi and Hou Qing gazed at it with pity!

Meanwhile, Snowy suddenly went close to it. She pointed the wooden sword at the python, pointed at the sky, and then pointed at the python again.

Her message was simple. She was telling it to lay low or it would suffer a beating.

However, the python suddenly gazed at Snowy with eyes filled with viciousness, and then it opened its huge mouth and tried to bite Snowy.

Snowy’s eyes opened wide, and then she flashed over to Qiong Qi’s back.

The python charged at Qiong Qi.

Qiong Qi just gazed coldly at it and didn’t do anything. Right when the python was around 30m away from him, a mysterious wave of energy descended from the sky and slammed down against the python.

Boom!

The python was slammed to the ground, and then a powerful wave of pressure pressed down upon it, causing it to shiver.

At this moment, terror filled its eyes, and the terror in its eyes gradually turned into one that was begging for mercy…

…

Meanwhile in the outside world. Yang Ye opened his eyes slowly and gazed at Ye Mo. The latter stared at Yang Ye, “I don’t care who you are. I’ll repeat myself one last time. Hand it over or I’ll kill everyone you know!”

Yang Ye was about to attack when Blood Maiden suddenly appeared in front of him. She gazed at him for a few breaths of time and said, “I’ll do it!”

She was about to attack once she finished speaking, but Yang Ye grabbed her arm and shook his head, “Heal first.”

He started walking slowly in Ye Mo’s direction.

Ye Mo’s face fell. Suddenly, Yang Ye’s right arm shook slightly, and then the golden talisman beneath his sleeve had been removed.

If he didn’t use his sword, it was utterly impossible for him to defeat Ye Mo, even if his body’s strength had improved tremendously. So, he had to use the Wargod’s arm.

As soon as the talisman was removed, Yang Ye felt like his entire right arm was filled with boundless strength. However, his face seemed extremely calm. Presently, his strength had improved in all aspects, so he could get used to the strength contained within the Wargod’s arm.

The reason he chose to keep it sealed was because he hadn’t fully merged with the arm, so he didn’t want to be constantly affected by the strength within it.

Meanwhile, Ye Mo spoke ferociously, “Since you want to die, then I’ll fulfill your wish!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he stomped his right foot down and transformed into a ray of black light. It was extremely swift and instantly arrived before Yang Ye.

At the same time, Yang Ye suddenly pulled his right leg back slightly, and then clenched his fist before pulling it back. A moment later, he slammed his right fist forward!

Boom!

A wave of powerful energy surged out from Yang Ye’s fist, and it instantly obliterated the black light. As for Ye Mo, he was blasted over 1km away!

Countless people were shocked by this scene!

At this moment, everyone grew even more curious about Yang Ye’s identity.

After he punched Ye Mo away, Yang Ye didn’t stop. His figure shot over to Ye Mo before swinging another punch.

It was simple and direct!

The energy contained within Yang Ye’s punch was extremely terrifying, and space warped severely in its wake. Moreover, the space around him even cracked open! It was extremely shocking! Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Ye Mo was shocked when he sensed the energy contained within Yang Ye’s punch. He didn’t dare act carelessly, and the profound energy within him surged madly before he stretched his right hand forward. In an instant, a black vortex appeared on his fist, and then an extremely terrifying wave of energy erupted from it!

Just like that, their attacks collided in the most direct manner.

Boom!

As soon as they came into contact, both Yang Ye and Ye Mo were blasted backwards repeatedly. Ye Mo was pushed almost 1km back while Yang Ye was pushed around 300m back. An instant later, Yang Ye stomped his right foot down and shot forward like a cannonball.

A moment later, Yang Ye was in front of Ye Mo again, and he slammed his fist forward.

Yang Ye didn’t use any techniques, and he just swung a simple punch!

Simple and violent!

After fighting intensely for around an hour, Ye Mo was unable to persist for much longer.

Yang Ye’s physical strength had just been improved and coupled with the Wargod’s arm, his strength was sufficient to suppress 6th stage True Realm experts. Of course, the most important part was his recovery. The powerful energy released by them had shaken both their bodies during their intense fight.

However, with the recuperative abilities of the Primordial Violet Energy within him, such injuries were simply nothing to Yang Ye. However, Ye Mo didn’t possess such extraordinary recuperative abilities. So, he was gradually unable to persist as the battle dragged on.

Bang!

Suddenly, Ye Mo and Yang Ye split apart. But just a moment later, Yang Ye appeared in front of Ye Mo again. After that, Yang Ye’s fists descended like raindrops towards Ye Mo.

Ye Mo was pushed back repeatedly by Yang Ye’s flurry of attacks.

Suppression!

At this point in the battle, Ye Mo was being completely suppressed by Yang Ye’s flurry of attacks, and he could only defend himself. As for Yang Ye, he grew more and more energetic as the battle progressed.

Actually, Yang Ye was quite fond of using his fists. Because the feeling of striking something was truly nice.

But he didn’t get the same feeling when using a sword.

Bang!

Suddenly, Ye Mo was blasted away again.

Yang Ye was about to attack again when Ye Mo suddenly said, “You’re Yang Ye, right?”

Countless people were stunned when they heard him. A moment later, they shot hostile gazes at Yang Ye!

As for Nether Maiden and Blood Maiden, their expressions became quite unsightly. Once Yang Ye’s presence was exposed, the consequences would be very severe.

This was Divine Ruins City, and there were countless people here who were looking for Yang Ye!

It should be said that there were countless throughout Heaven Pillar Mountain who were looking for Yang Ye!

Yang Ye remained silent, and he just appeared before Ye Mo and slammed his fist forward.

Boom!

Ye Mo was blasted over 300m away while a mouthful of blood sprayed from him.

Yang Ye was about to attack again when Ye Mo suddenly pointed at Yang Ye, “Everyone, he’s Yang Ye! The wooden sword capable of piercing the barrier is with him!”

Yang Ye ignored Ye Mo and was about to attack. However, a few dozen powerful auras suddenly pressed down towards him.

Yang Ye’s face fell when he sensed this.

Meanwhile, an old man suddenly gazed at Yang Ye, “You’re really Yang Ye?”

Yang Ye spoke indifferently, “No!”

“No?” Ye Mo suddenly laughed fiercely, “Yang Ye, I’ve investigated you. You’re not just outstanding in the Sword Dao; your physical body is extremely strong as well. Moreover, you’ve comprehended slaughter intent too.”

Everyone gazed at Yang Ye and awaited his answer!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye said, “I said I’m not! So I’m not!”

Ye Mo suddenly waved his right hand, and a sword appeared before Yang Ye, “Yang Ye, since you say you’re not Yang Ye, then do you dare to pick up that sword?”

The other experts nodded slightly. Yang Ye was a peerless sword cultivator. So long as he picked up a sword, they would definitely be able to sense if he was Yang Ye or not.

Yang Ye gazed at the sword in silence.

Meanwhile, Ye Mo laughed coldly, “What? You don’t dare to?”

Yang Ye looked up at Ye Mo, and then he grabbed the sword and vanished on the spot.

Split Second combined with the Grand Teleportation Technique!

An instant later, Yang Ye was behind Ye Mo, and Ye Mo’s body had stiffened.

A moment of silence ensued, and then a string of blood sprayed from the center of Ye Mo’s forehead!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye removed his robe and glanced coldly at the surroundings, “I’m Yang Ye! Kill me if you can!”
