Chapter 2151 – Let’s Fight!

Yang Ye shook his head, “I’ll stop joking. I’m here to look for someone!”

“Huh?” The old man glanced at Yang Ye and asked, “I think you’re here to look for death!”

Yang Ye smiled, “I’m not here for that. I am here to look for someone.”

The old man gazed at Yang Ye for a long time. Suddenly, he tapped his finger at Yang Ye’s forehead, but he missed. Because Yang Ye was over 1km away.

The old man had quite a solemn expression on his face when he witnessed this.

Yang Ye restrained his smile and said, “I’m really here to look for someone. I’m not joking.”

The old man asked, “Who are you looking for?”

Yang Ye replied, “Qian Ying, your leader!”

The old man’s eyes narrowed slightly, “I think you’re looking for death!”

He was about to attack again once he finished speaking, but a sword suddenly pressed against his forehead. The old man’s figure instantly stiffened, and Yang Ye had appeared before the old man.

Yang Ye was about to speak when a voice suddenly came from within the pavilion behind the old man, “You’re here to see Qian Ying?”

Yang Ye looked at the pavilion and nodded.

The voice asked, “Why?”

Yang Ye replied, “To help someone give her a message!”

The voice asked, “Who?”

Yang Ye frowned, “Are you going to let me see her or not?”

Suddenly, a woman in a black dress appeared in front of Yang Ye. She was wearing a mask, so he couldn’t see her appearance.

Meanwhile, the old man bowed slightly and left!

She looked Yang Ye in the eyes, and she emanated a cold aura, “Who sent you?”

Yang Ye glanced at the woman and replied, “A senior…”

At this point, Yang Ye suddenly realized that the middle aged man who taught him Backstab seemed to have not given him a name!

Yang Ye thought for a moment and said, “A senior. He taught me Backstab, and you should know Backstab…”

“It’s him!” Suddenly, the woman appeared very close to Yang Ye, very close.

Yang Ye nodded and replied, “He asked me to give you a message!”

At this moment, he knew who the woman before him was. She was probably Qian Ying.

The woman asked, “Where is he?”

Yang Ye replied, “He’s dead.”

“Dead?” She suddenly grabbed Yang Ye by the throat, “Who in this large universe can kill him?”

Yang Ye frowned, “Can we talk properly or not?”

She gazed at Yang Ye for a long time, and then she released him, “No one can kill him!”

Yang Ye said, “The strength of the person who killed him is beyond your imagination. Of course, that isn’t important. What’s important is that I’ll be leaving once I give you his message.”

She glanced at Yang Ye and asked, “Are you sure he’s dead?”

Yang Ye nodded.

She fell silent. A long time passed before she asked, “What’s the message?”

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and asked, “Is he your master?”

“My adoptive father too!” She continued, “I wouldn’t be who I am today without him!”

Yang Ye thought for a long time, and then he said, “He asked me to tell you that he found the person responsible for killing your parents, and he has killed that person. So, you don’t have to continue thinking about revenge!”

Qian Ying closed her eyes slowly. A long time passed before she gazed at Yang Ye, “Do you know where he died?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “I don’t!”

Qian Yin asked, “He taught you Backstab?”

Yang Ye nodded, “Yes!”

She said, “Then stay in Blood Death Pavilion from now on and help me manage it!”

Yang Ye was stunned speechless.

Qian Ying noticed the change in his expression and asked, “What is it?”

Yang Ye smiled, “I’m afraid I can’t stay. I have many other things to do in other worlds. My plan was to leave once I gave you the message, and it’s time to leave now!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye cupped his fist to her and left.

Meanwhile, Qian Ling stood there on the spot and gazed blankly at where Yang Ye had been standing. A long time passed before she spoke softly, “I didn’t expect you to have perished…”

…

Yang Ye didn’t stay on Void Spirit Continent, and he went straight to the endless black holes.

The endless black holes were outside of the large universe, and the large universe could be said to be surrounded by them.

A day later, Yang Ye arrived outside the large universe.

As he stood in the starry sky, an expanse of pitch black laid before him. He couldn’t see anything there, and he noticed that the starlight behind would vanish upon arriving close to him.

Even light couldn’t pass through the black holes!

Suddenly, Yang Ye turned to the side, and he saw a group of people traveling in this direction. Yang Ye frowned when he saw the person who was leading the group, and then a smile curled up on his face, “Enemies always meet!”

The group stopped there too. The leader of that group had noticed Yang Ye, and it didn’t take long for them to arrive in front of him.

The group was led by a middle aged man, and the middle aged man was none other than the Sovereign of Sky! There were over a dozen Sages behind him!

The Sovereign of Sky glanced at Yang Ye and said, “What a coincidence!”

Yang Ye smiled, “Indeed.”

The Sovereign of Sky spoke indifferently, “Looks like you’re here for the endless black holes too.”

Yang Ye cracked his neck, “So, Sovereign of Sky, how about we have a fight?”

Fight!

The others here exchanged glances, and then they gazed at Yang Ye.

Yang Ye was challenging the Sovereign of Sky!

A Major Zen Realm expert was actually challenging the Sovereign of Sky! They would find it to be absurd if anyone else did that, but it was Yang Ye.

The Sovereign of Sky gazed at Yang Ye for a long time and said, “Looks like you’re growing more and more confident.”

Yang Ye spoke indifferently, “Cut the crap and just tell me if you dare. We’ll fight one on one! Of course, you can gang up on me if you want!”

The Sovereign of Sky chuckled, “Of course. I want to see how strong you are too!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he shot up above.

Yang Ye followed after him.

The other Sages didn’t do anything.

The Sovereign of Sky gazed at Yang Ye and was about to speak when Yang Ye suddenly appeared in front of him, and then a ray of light descended from above.

Everywhere it passed, space was sliced apart and obliterated.

The Sovereign of Sky’s expression remained calm. He took a step forward and slapped his palm forward.

Bang!

An explosion resounded throughout the surroundings, and then a figure was blasted away. It was Yang Ye’s figure.

Yang Ye’s figure flew over 3km away. As soon as he stopped, the space below him cracked open and collapsed.

Suddenly, the Sovereign of Sky vanished on the spot, and he was in front of Yang Ye when he appeared again. A moment later, a powerful aura swept out from within him, and it instantly slammed against Yang Ye. Moreover, it was accompanied by a hand.

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly. He didn’t dare act carelessly at all and immediately moved his left leg to the side, and then he grabbed his sword with both hands before swinging it forward.

Hiss!

Space instantly turned ethereal before it.

Boom!

As soon as Yang Ye’s sword descended, a terrifying wave of energy erupted, and it blasted Yang Ye and the Sovereign of Sky away from each other. A distance of around 1km had been created between them.

The Sovereign of Sky gazed at Yang Ye, “Extraordinary indeed.”

Yang Ye possessed such strength at such an age. Just that made him feel quite shocked. When he heard that Yang Ye and An Nanjing had killed the Sovereign of Man in an instant, he’d thought that the Sovereign of Man had been careless. But now he realized that the Sovereign of Man hadn’t been careless, and it was that Yang Ye and An Nanjing’s strength were extremely terrifying indeed!

He restrained his thoughts and said, “Come, take this move of mine!”

As soon as he finished speaking, the Sovereign of Sky raised his right hand slightly. In an instant, the entire battlefield started to warp.

A moment later, he flipped his right palm, “Overturn!”

As soon as he said that, the entire battlefield was overturned. At the same time, an invisible wave of energy tore open the battlefield incessantly.

Suddenly, rays of light shot out from the shattered battlefield, and then the battlefield was instantly obliterated by these two types of energy.

Just like that, the battlefield was transformed into a huge black hole.

A long time passed before it gradually returned to normal.

Meanwhile, the Sovereign of Sky and Yang Ye appeared here once more. Both of them had quite pale countenances. Obviously, the battle hadn’t been easy for any of them.

Yang Ye glanced at the Sovereign of Sky, and there was a slightly solemn expression in his eyes. He hadn’t used his trump cards, and he noticed that he couldn’t do anything to the Sovereign of Sky when he didn’t use his trump cards. Of course, the Sovereign of Sky couldn’t harm him either. However, he was certain that the Sovereign of Sky had trump cards too.

Both of them hadn’t used their full strength in this battle.

The Sovereign of Sky gazed at Yang Ye for a long time and said, “In the younger generation of the large universe, besides that woman, An Nanjing, who’s with you, I’m afraid you’re invincible.”

His face was absolutely gloomy when he spoke up to this point.

He’d thought of something.

The only monstrous genius who could fight Yang Ye was on Yang Ye’s side!

So, who could possibly stop them once they both grew completely?

The Sovereign of Sky gazed at Yang Ye, and a thought soundlessly appeared in his mind.

I should make Xiao Qi contact Yang Ye!

At this moment, that was what the Sovereign of Sky was thinking!
