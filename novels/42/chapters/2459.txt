Chapter 2460 – Do I Need You to Welcome Me?

Even the blades of a sword had spirits!

It was the first time Yang Ye had heard of it, and it was also the first time he’d seen one!

Chen Xuanan grinned, “It’s special. Remember that this sword is sharp, so be careful with your control and use of it!”

Yang Ye glanced at Executor and waved it lightly.

Hiss!

Everywhere it passed, space was sliced open.

It had been sliced open with absolute ease!

It was absolutely powerful!

Yang Ye was quite shocked. The sword was at least a few times sharper than it had been! It could be said that it was perfectly capable of piercing Erya’s defenses now!

Chen Xuanan suddenly said, “I’ve sealed its true consciousness, and the Blade Spirit only holds a small portion of its consciousness. The reason I did that is because your current strength isn’t sufficient to subdue it. When your strength has risen to a certain extent, come see me again, and I’ll help you fully unseal it. Don’t make me wait too long!”

Yang Ye put the sword away and bowed slightly to Chen Xuanan, “Thank you!”

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and asked, “Senior, what do you seek?”

He never believed that anything would just drop out of the sky and into his lap. If it happened to Snowy, then he may believe it, but he would never believe it if it happened to him.

Chen Xuanan shook his head slightly, “Don’t think too much about it. I’m not scheming against you, nor is that even necessary. I’m helping you because your Sword Dao suits my taste, and that is all!”

Yang Ye bowed to Chen Xuanan again, “Take care, Senior!”

Yang Ye turned around and left.

Chen Xuanan shook his head slightly and slowly closed his eyes.

Actually, Yang Ye hadn’t noticed that Chen Xuanan’s body had turned quite a bit more ethereal! It was because of the unsealing! If he was in his prime, something like this would be nothing for him. But now, every consumption of his strength was lethal!

Yang Ye left the Northern Sword Sect, and the talisman in his spatial ring started to tremble.

Yang Ye withdrew it, and some time passed before he vanished on the spot.

Eternal Border, Eternal River.

In order to get to Eternal River, one had to traverse Eternal Mountain Range. At this moment, around 30 people were gathered deep within the mountain range! They were the experts of the Creation Sect and Immortality Sect!

They were led by a middle aged man and an old man. The middle aged man’s name was Zhao Wuji, the Creation Sect’s Master, and the strongest in the Creation Sect right now. He was a peak Four World Realm expert! The old man, on the other hand, was the Immortality Sect’s Master, Mo Liansheng. He was a peak Four World Realm expert too. There were around 30 people behind them, and all of these people were Limitbreaker Realm experts. There were 9 at the Three World Realm, and the rest were at the Two World Realm and One World Realm!

At this moment, all of them had gloomy and unsightly expressions on their faces because they’d received news of Yang Ye’s arrival at their sects.

Both their sects had been destroyed!

“How dare he!” Suddenly, Mo Liansheng spoke gloomily, “Does that guy, Yang Ye, really plan to kill us all?!”

All of them knew what Yang Ye sought, it was their annihilation!

Meanwhile, Zhao Wuji spoke solemnly, “We only have two choices now. Firstly, side with Eternal Kingdom. Yang Ye will only fear us once we join them!”

Mo Liansheng asked, “The second is to side with the desolate race?”

Zhao Wuji shook his head, “According to the information I obtained, Yang Ye and the desolate race’s crown prince, Huang Ying, are good friends. If we side with them, we’ll probably be walking into our own graves.”

Mo Liansheng thought for a while and said, “Side with the Eternal Kingdom… The problem with that is they only want the top experts around here. The two of us can join them, but what about the others who are relying on us? Moreover, they already look down on Eternal Border, so if we go to them seeking to join them, they will probably look down on us even more. Even if they let us join Eternal Kingdom, they won’t let us enter Eternal Kingdom, and they’ll just use us as cannon fodder against the desolate race!”

Zhao Wuji nodded, “You’re absolutely correct. If we side with the Eternal Kingdom, they won’t even value us, and the final outcome would either be death at Yang Ye’s hands or be used as cannon fodder. The desolate race won’t work either. So, we only have one other place to go!”

Mo Liansheng asked, “Where?”

Zhao Wuji smiled, “The Di Clan! The Di Clan that has joined forces with the desolate race!”

The Di Clan? Mo Liansheng frowned slightly, “Would they be willing to offend Yang Ye and take us in?”

As one of the top powers in Eternal Border, they naturally knew of the Di Clan, one of the top clans in Eternal Kingdom.

“Of course they would!” Zhao Wuji spoke solemnly, “The Di Clan sent its forces to kill Yang Ye in the past. Unfortunately, they failed. Yang Ye killed all the experts they sent. Most importantly, according to my knowledge, a clan in Eternal Kingdom is planning to become united to the Di Clan by marriage. But sadly, that woman wasn’t willing to accept her fate, and then she got close to Yang Ye and Huang Ying. The Di Clan would naturally not look for trouble with Huang Ying who’s the crown prince of the desolate race now, but what about Yang Ye? Yang Ye isn’t the crown prince of the desolate race!”Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Zhao Wuji smiled at this point, “Moreover, they sent their people to contact me, and they wished for us to join them. Everyone knows that war is about to break out. The side with the most experts has the greatest likelihood of having the last laugh in that war. We’re all Limitbreaker Realm experts, so we’ll be taken seriously by the Di Clan. After all, they aren’t as strong as the desolate race or Eternal Kingdom.”

Mo Liansheng asked, “They contacted you?”

Zhao Wuji nodded, “But I didn’t agree right away. Brother Mo, I’ve decided to take the forces of my Creation Sect and side with them. Are you willing to come with us?”

Mo Liansheng was quite hesitant.

Zhao Wuji spoke solemnly, “Brother Mo, if Eternal Kingdom is willing to open its doors to us and let us enter Eternal Kingdom, then I would be willing to side with them. But the problem is they won’t. Do you think we’ll be safe if we remain outside Eternal Kingdom? Now, only the desolate race and Di Clan can protect us, and we can forget about the desolate race because of Yang Ye, so only the Di Clan remains!”

Mo Liansheng thought for a long time before he nodded, “Alright, let’s go!”

It didn’t take long for them to vanish on the spot.

Around 15 minutes after they left, a ray of light descended in the mountain range.

The light dispersed and Yang Ye appeared where Mo Liansheng and the others had been. There was no one here, so Yang Ye frowned and withdrew the transmission talisman. A short while later, a voice came from within it, “You’re too late!”

Yang Ye asked, “Where have they gone?”

The voice fell silent for a short while before it replied, “The Emperor World, the Di Clan!”

“The Di Clan?” Yang Ye frowned. The clan that A’Leng’s family wanted to force her to marry into?

Nanli Meng’s voice came from the transmission talisman again, “The Di Clan was once a clan in Eternal Kingdom. They were forced out during the war, and their strength has grown since then! Moreover, according to my investigations, they seem to have joined forces with the desolate race.”

The desolate race, the Di Clan!

Yang Ye nodded and withdrew the Myriad World Diagram. It didn’t take long for him to locate the Emperor World.

Suddenly, Nanli Meng’s voice arose, “Are you really going to go?”

Yang Ye asked, “Why?”

Nanli Meng spoke solemnly, “The Di Clan isn’t ordinary. While it’s inferior to the desolate race and Eternal Kingdom, it’s absolutely not an existence you can fight right now. Let me explain it to you like this, the Di Clan definitely has Five World Realm experts, and they have more than one!”

Five World Realm experts!

Yang Ye nodded, “Thank you for the warning!”

Yang Ye pressed down his right hand.

Hiss!

A ray of white light instantly enveloped him, and then he vanished without a trace!

On the other side, Nanli Meng sighed softly.

A black robed man standing near Nanli Meng suddenly said, “Eternal Kingdom has contacted us and wants us to join them! And it wasn’t just them, the Di Clan contacted us too.”

Nanli Meng replied indifferently, “What does Senior Shang think?”

The black robed man replied solemnly, “Senior Shang wants to hear your opinion!”

Nanli Meng shook her head, “Tell him not to join the Di Clan or Eternal Kingdom.”

The black robed man replied, “I’m afraid that’s impossible. The Di Clan won’t be a huge problem, but Eternal Kingdom is being very overbearing. It’s either friend or enemy for them. That’s what they said to us.”

Nanli Meng laughed coldly, “They are very overbearing. That’s fine. If we can’t offend them, we can still hide!”

The black robed man hesitated for a moment. He was about to speak when she said, “Just tell Senior Shang what I said.”

The black robed man nodded, “I’ll be taking my leave then!”

He turned around and left.

Nanli Meng glanced at the surroundings, “Uniting as one? That’s impossible now!”

In the beginning, she’d planned to unite all the experts of Eternal Border. Only then would Eternal Border have the right to negotiate with powers like Eternal Kingdom and the Di Clan. But along with Yang Ye’s return, everything was destroyed.

She didn’t dare to unite them because if she did, then based on Yang Ye’s character, he would definitely slaughter the Nanli Clan too.

Strictly speaking, Yang Ye and her weren’t true friends, and they could only be considered to be acquaintances who were friendly with each other! But that alone wasn’t enough to make Yang Ye put down his desire for vengeance. She’d tried, and failed!

Nanli Meng shook her head, sighed, and vanished on the spot.

She’d tried her best.

The Emperor World.

Around 15 minutes later, Yang Ye arrived here.

As soon as Yang Ye did, a white haired old man appeared before him.

A peak Four World Realm expert!

Yang Ye was about to speak when the old man suddenly said, “Yang Ye, you’re not welcome here. Leave in 10 breaths of time or suffer the consequences!”

Yang Ye was stunned for a moment, and then he shook his head and smiled, “Do I need you to welcome me?”
