Chapter 171 – Intentions

Yin Xuan’er laughed coldly. She was just about to say something when Yang Ye shouted. “Enough!”

At this moment, he was extremely annoyed. He’d come here to take care of important business and not to watch the two of them confront and attack each other.

Qin Xiyue walked gracefully over to Yang Ye’s side and revealed a gentle smile as she said, “Alright, don’t be angry. I won’t argue with her.” Her features were so warm and gentle that it almost seemed capable of melting icecaps.

Yang Ye. "...."

Yin Xuan’er grunted coldly, and then she looked at Yang Ye and said, “I’m going out. I’ll return once I’ve finished attending to my business!”

“Where are you going?” Yang Ye frowned and said, “You know that you’re the public enemy of the entire southern territory. What if the six great powers notice you?”

“Are you concerned about me?” Yin Xuan’er suddenly cracked a smile.

Yang Ye said indifferently, “I’m afraid you’d stir up trouble and drag me down with you!”

Yin Xuan’er’s expression turned cold while she said, “Don’t worry, I won’t implicate you!” As soon as she finished speaking, her figure flashed and vanished in the room.

After she left, Qin Xiyue said, “Little Brother, you’re clearly concerned about her, so why did you speak like that?”

“Was I?” Yang Ye smiled and said, “Or perhaps I should say, does she need the concern of others? Don’t forget that she’s a Spirit Realm expert that’s skilled in all sorts of illusion techniques. Even an Exalt Realm expert might not be able to take her life!”

Qin Xiyue said, “Little Brother, she’s so beautiful. Are you really not tempted by her at all? Big Sister noticed that she seems to have some interest in you. But she’d just too prideful, so she refuses to show any weakness. If you’re still angry at her because of what happened that day, then there’s entirely no need for that because she might have acted in that way out of jealousy!”

“Jealousy?” Yang Ye was puzzled. “What jealousy?”

“Fool!” Qin Xiyue rolled her eyes at him and said, “She can’t stand to watch us having such an intimate relationship. She definitely didn’t target me that day solely because I’m a princess of the Grand Qin Empire, and it’s mostly because our relationship is too intimate!”

“Don’t joke around!” Yang Ye shook his head and said, “I feel that I, Yang Ye, don’t possess such great charm that I’m able to make a Spirit Realm Expert who’d just met me once to fall in love with me. Moreover, our relationship isn’t intimate, right?”

“How do you know that you don’t possess such charm?” Qin Xiyue smiled and said, “Moreover, Little Brother, can you really say that with a clear conscience? You’ve hugged and kissed Big Sister, and all that’s left is to spend a night together. If this isn’t intimate, then what is? Could it be that we really have to spend a night together?”

"...."

Yang Ye was truly speechless. He wasn’t one that was good at talking with women, so he was always in a passive position when he was in the company of Qin Xiyue. However, for some unknown reason, he actually didn’t dislike it.

Could it be that men really like things like this sometimes? Yang Ye shook his head and said with a serious expression. “Let’s not talk about all of that and get down to business. How is the formation of that organization going?”

Qin Xiyue restrained her smile and said, “I’ve taken in some orphans in secret, and I’ve started training them. However, we’re slightly tight in terms of resources. Besides funds, we face another problem, and it’s that we don’t possess any suitable techniques and teachers for them. Even though I’m at the King Realm, I’m not skilled in assassinations. So, the biggest problem we face is that we must purchase some cultivation techniques and combat techniques related to assassins and find some people skilled in assassination to teach them!”

Yang Ye frowned because establishing this organization of assassins was even more difficult and troublesome than he’d imagined! The problem with funding wasn’t a huge issue because he was a Talisman Master after all. But the matter of obtaining cultivation techniques and combat techniques related to assassinations and teachers skilled in assassinations was slightly difficult to resolve. After all, such techniques were extremely rare in the southern territory, and they couldn’t just be bought with money!

However, if those orphans were given ordinary techniques to learn, then how could they go against a colossus like the Flower Palace? Only assassins might be able to create a slight threat to the Flower Palace.

Meanwhile, Qin Xiyue said, “I can procure assassination techniques!”

Yang Ye was delighted. “You can?”

Qin Xiyue nodded and said, “There are numerous privately and secretly held auctions in the Imperial Capital. Not to mention assassination techniques, even Earth Rank techniques could be purchased during these auctions. However, privately-held sales like these were usually conducted by way of exchange. In other words, we can only use other treasures to exchange for what we need!”

“Would talismans of the five elements and Technique Talismans be sufficient?” asked Yang Ye.

“Of course!” Qin Xiyue said, “Both of them are good treasures. Especially Technique Talismans, those might not even be possible to buy even if one had the money.”

“Then it isn’t a problem!” Yang Ye smiled. Talismans were the one thing he didn’t lack at all, and even if he did, his master and Bao’er would be able to provide him with some....

“Your master is Master Lin Shan, so of course it isn’t a problem!” Qin Xiyue rolled her eyes at Yang Ye and said, “But teachers skilled in assassinations are difficult to find. Practically all such individuals are within the League of Doom, but the League of Doom’s members would absolutely not leave the league to teach others in secret. In any case, I don’t care. You have to deal with this problem!”

Yang Ye smiled bitterly and said, “Even you know that the number of people I know in the Imperial Capital can be counted on a single hand. So where would I look for such a person? Xiyue, you’ve been in the capital for so many years and even belong to the Imperial Household. You ought to have a way to accomplish it, right?”

“Of course I do....” A wisp of a charming smile arose on the corners of Qin Xiyue’s mouth, and she said, “But Little Brother, how will you repay me?”

Yang Ye shrugged and said, “Great Princess Qin, tell me your conditions!”

“Really?”

“Of course!”

“Big Sister wants to marry you. What do you think about this condition?”

“Can we be serious?” Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“I am!” Qin Xiyue suddenly restrained her smile and spoke seriously.

Yang Ye frowned and said, “What do you mean!?”

“Exactly what I said!” Qin Xiyue smiled and said, “Even though Big Sister succeeded in escaping my betrothal, I won’t be able to avoid being a tool of the Imperial Household to rope in geniuses. Instead of that, isn’t it better for Big Sister to choose herself? What do you think? What? You don’t think Big Sister is worthy of you, huh!?”

Yang Ye shook his head and said, “Miss Xiyue, I’ve told you, I already like someone. Moreover, I think she probably likes me a little as well. So, it’s impossible for anything to occur between us.”

“Isn’t it normal for men to have a few wives?” Qin Xiyue smiled and said, “What? Little Brother, you still haven’t attained ‘enlightenment’!?"

Yang Ye smiled and said, “I would like that as well, but it’s not realistic in the end. Moreover, it isn’t fair to either one of you. Both of you have the right to receive the full love of someone.”

Qin Xiyue shook her head, and then she looked Yang Ye in the eye and said, “Little Brother, you have a resolute and ruthless character, but you’re slightly weak when it comes to feelings. Tell Big Sister the truth, do you really not like Big Sister at all? If you say that you don’t, then Big Sister won’t mention this again, and once the Ascension Rankings comes to an end, I’ll look for a genius that has ascended the Ascension Rankings to marry!”

"...."In all honesty, do I really not like this woman at all? Yang Ye wasn’t sure, he wasn’t sure if he liked her or not. But he couldn’t deny that he would feel slightly uncomfortable if she were to marry another and be together with that person....

Since it would make me feel uncomfortable, then it means I do like her. Yang Ye took a deep breath and said, “Xiyue, do you like me?”

“Guess!” Qin Xiyue blinked.

"...."

Yang Ye was just about to speak when a wave of fragrance suddenly assaulted his nose, and then Qin Xiyue had arrived in front of him. She held his waist with both hands, and then her scarlet red and tender lips pressed down onto his own.

Yang Ye stopped thinking about the question from before.

He was able to sense that Qin Xiyue’s kiss wasn’t skilled, or it should be said that both of them were extremely unskilled. However, one usually learned such things without the need for a teacher. In next to no time, Yang Ye’s tongue was unwilling to stay where it was, and he exerted a little strength to charge forward and capture that soft, moist, and delicate tongue before it.

Moreover, his hands were unwilling to stay ‘lonely’. They gradually climbed up Qin Xiyue’s curvy hips and started squeezing lightly. Before long, his hands were unwilling to stay here any longer, and they slowly climbed further, and then two plump balls were in his hands....
