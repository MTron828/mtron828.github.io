Chapter 1535 - Sword Cultivators Draw Their Swords When Enraged!

Translator: InVader

Act like a human being? Hu Meng was stunned. What do you mean human being?

Meanwhile, Yang Ye had vanished on the spot.

At this moment, Yang Ye was naturally displeased. He’d queued up for an entire day, but someone had immediately jumped the queue. Anyone would be displeased by that!

Rules!

If they wanted him to abide by the rules, that wasn’t a problem, but others had to abide by it as well. If others didn’t abide by the rules yet he had to, then they were clearly dreaming.

Right at the moment that Yang Ye’s figure vanished, the violet robed young man suddenly stopped, turned around, and slammed his fist forward!

Bang!

An explosion resounded, and then the young man was pushed over 300m away while Yang Ye had been pushed 300m back as well.

A wisp of surprise flashed through Yang Ye’s eyes. He’d underestimated the young man’s strength. The young man was at the Deity Realm, so he hadn’t used his full strength and had used less than 50% of his strength.

Something worth mentioning was that the realms of cultivation in the demon race from the Semi-Deity Realm and above were the same as the human race. It was the Deity Realm, Dualism Realm, then Rebirth Realm. Because demon beasts could actually change their meridians and energy passageways upon attaining the Deity Realm, and then cultivate profound energy. However, very few demon beasts did that.

If demon beasts who’d cultivated their bodies for their entire lifetimes suddenly chose to cultivate profound energy, it wouldn’t just be a waste of time, it would be completely useless too!

A wisp of surprise flashed through the young man’s eyes, “Looks like you’re definitely someone well-known since you were able to resist a punch of mine. Tell me your name.”

Yang Ye didn’t want to waste his breath and intended to attack. However, Hu Meng suddenly grabbed Yang Ye’s arm and said, “He’s Lan Chi, a genius of the Leopard Clan. The Leopard Clan is the strongest clan in our area, and he’s the greatest genius in our area. We can’t afford to offend him!”

Yang Ye was about to speak when a man who was behind them in the line had suddenly stepped forward. The man glanced at Yang Ye and Hu Meng, and then he gazed at Lan Chi. He revealed a smile when his gaze descended upon Lan Chi, and he said, “Brother Lan Chi, don’t make a fuss about it with these ignorant fellows. You have urgent matters to attend to, so go on ahead.”

Yang Ye was stunned.

Lan Chi nodded slightly, and then he glanced at Yang Ye, “Remember that today is your lucky day because I’m in a good mood!” As he spoke, he turned around and started walking towards the teleportation formation again.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly said, “Then I’m sorry but today is your unlucky day because I’m in a very bad mood!”

Lan Chi stopped and turned to look at Yang Ye, he hadn’t even spoken when that young man who stepped forward earlier had suddenly walked over to Yang Ye, “Do you know that you’re wasting everyone’s time by doing this?”

“Fuck off! Let Brother Lan Chi go first.”

“Exactly, stop wasting everyone’s time. Young Master Lan Chi, just ignore him and go on. I’ll deal with him if he dares to make another sound!”

“He really doesn’t know what’s good for him…”

The others behind Yang Ye and Hu Meng started to curse angrily, but they weren’t cursing Lan Chi, they were cursing Yang Ye.

Yang Ye glanced at the demon beasts here and shook his head, “Obsequiousness… Humans aren’t the only ones who have it, the demon race is no exception!”

Hu Meng glanced at the surroundings and spoke coldly, “Are all of you blind? Who was the one who jumped the queue? Is that all the backbone all of you have?”

Yang Ye glanced at Hu Meng. He hadn’t expected that fellow didn’t stay away from him at a time like this and was even supporting him instead.

Not bad!

Meanwhile, the young man in front of Yang Ye said, “Do you know…”

“Cut the crap!” Yang Ye interrupted the young man, and then he grabbed the young man’s throat before the young man could even react. After that, he lifted up the young man and slammed him against the ground!

Bang!

Everyone hadn’t even recovered from their shock when the young man’s head slammed against the ground, causing the ground there to crack apart while blood sprayed!

All the demon beasts here were stunned.

Yang Ye glanced at the young man and spoke coldly, “If you want to flatter someone, you should choose the right time and place!” As soon as he finished speaking, he kicked the young man’s stomach.

Bang!

The latter was blasted a few kilometers away before slamming against the ground. His fate was unknown.

All the demon beasts here were stunned when they saw Yang Ye instantly crush that young man. After all, the young man was a Semi-Deity!

However, a Semi-Deity hadn’t even had the strength to fight back!

How strong!

That was what all the demon beasts thought right now!

Meanwhile, the violet robed young man suddenly spoke solemnly, “Who are you?!”

Yang Ye looked up at the violet robed young man. He didn’t waste his breath and just appeared before the violet robed young man, and then he slammed his fist forward.

This time, he hadn’t held back!

Space shook before his fist, and it was an extremely shocking sight.

The violet robed young man’s expression changed when he saw Yang Ye’s attack, and he knew that he’d met his match. He didn’t dare act carelessly, and he clenched his right hand while a thin layer of golden scales instantly covered his fist. After that, he slammed it at Yang Ye’s fist.

Actually, his instinct was to dodge when he saw Yang Ye’s punch. However, he couldn’t afford to lose face like that. Losing wasn’t a problem, but if he didn’t even dare to go against Yang Ye’s attack, then he wouldn’t be able to hold his head up high in public anymore.

Crack!

The sound of bones cracking resounded, and then Lan Chi’s arm flew into the air. Meanwhile, his figure was blasted flying as well. In the end, he slammed against the ground and blasted open a deep hole there.

He’d lost!

He’d been defeated by a single attack!

All the demon beasts here watched with disbelief. Lan Chi was a Deity, and he was the greatest genius in this area. So, his combat strength far surpassed ordinary Deities. However, just one attack! Just one attack had been used to defeat him!

At this moment, Hu Meng was completely stunned. He knew Yang Ye was strong because he’d personally experienced Yang Ye’s strength, but he hadn’t expected Yang Ye to be that strong!

After he punched the violet robed young man away, Yang Ye paid no further attention to him. Yang Ye turned to look at the crowd behind him, and he said, “Who said he would deal with me?”

As he spoke, Yang Ye’s gaze descended onto one of the young men in the crowd, “Stop hiding! I’m talking about you! I remember you!”

As soon as he finished speaking.

Bang!

The young man was blasted away, and he crashed to the ground after flying over 3km away.

After that, Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings.

All of their expressions changed, and they moved backwards repeatedly. Not a single demon beast dared to say anything.

Yang Ye withdrew his gaze and looked at Hu Meng who was still shocked, “Let’s go!”

Hu Meng recovered from his shock when he heard Yang Ye, and then he nodded.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly appeared in front of Lan Chi, causing Lan Chi’s expression to change drastically. Does he intend to kill me?

Hu Meng’s expression changed as well. Just beating up the fellow wasn’t a big deal. If one lost in a battle with a peer, then one could blame no one. However, if Yang Ye killed the fellow, then Yang Ye would have gone too far, and the Leopard Clan would definitely not let the matter rest!

Yang Ye didn’t kill Lan Chi. He waved his right hand and Lan Chi’s spatial ring flew into his grasp, “This is my spoils from the battle. Do you have any objections?”

Lan Chi glanced at Yang Ye and shook his head.

Yang Ye glanced at Lan Chi, and then he went into the teleportation formation with Hu Meng. It didn’t take long for them to vanish.

Lan Chi heaved a sigh of relief when he saw Yang Ye and Hu Meng leave. Because he saw the intent to kill in Yang Ye’s eyes! If he’d nodded or tried to threaten Yang Ye, then he would definitely be dead!

Just as Lan Chi thought, if he really dared to object and say anything, then Yang Ye would have definitely killed him. Yang Ye didn’t care about the Leopard Clan because he was furious, so not to mention the Leopard Clan, he would even kill a member of the Divine Phoenix Clan.

Sword cultivators draw their swords when enraged!

Yang Ye displayed such a characteristic to its limits at most times!

One day later, Yang Ye and Hu Meng arrived at Heaven’s Vault City.

It was huge, extremely huge.

That was Yang Ye’s first thoughts of Heaven’s Vault City. It was much larger than any city he’d laid eyes on and standing within the city made him feel tiny. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Heaven’s Vault City’s walls were over 1km tall. What did that look like? It was like a mountain! As for its width, it was impossible to see the end of it.

Meanwhile, Hu Meng suddenly said, “Brother Ye, let me take you to a place!”

Yang Ye gazed at him, “Where?”

“You’ll know once we get there!” Hu Meng chuckled and led Yang Ye off the teleportation platform. It didn’t take long for Yang Ye to arrive at a square. At this moment, numerous demon beasts were gathered here. Of course, they were in human form. Even though Heaven’s Vault City was huge, it definitely couldn’t accommodate all the demon beasts here if they took their original form.

After all, the bodies of some demon beasts stretched for kilometers!

Yang Ye looked towards the distance. There was a rainbow colored stone pillar around 300m ahead. It was made from seven different colored ores. The highest part of it was dark violet. At this moment, demon beasts were frequently hitting the stone pillar, and every single time they struck it, a portion of the pillar would light up.

“A measurement pillar!” Hu Meng explained, “It can measure your strength. See the dark violet part at the top? It’s only possible for Rebirth Realm experts to light it up.”

Yang Ye glanced at it. Beneath the dark violet part was gold, red, and blue. Most of the demon beasts here could only light up the red part of the stone pillar.

Hu Meng smiled, “Want to give it a try?”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and nodded. He wanted to see how strong he was. It didn’t take long for Yang Ye to arrive before the stone pillar. When the other demon beasts saw Yang Ye’s size, all of them were stunned, and then many started looking at Yang Ye with slightly hostile gazes. Obviously, they suspected that he was human.

Fortunately, Hu Meng was by Yang Ye’s side, so they merely suspected it but didn’t look for trouble with him.

However, there was an exception.

Suddenly, a robust young man appeared in front of Yang Ye, “Why does your figure look like the figure of a human?”

“A human?” Yang Ye gazed at him, “You’re the human! Your whole family is full of humans!”

The young man’s expression changed, and then he laughed coldly, “You’re not human? Fine! Do you dare to take a punch of mine?”

Yang Ye felt speechless.
