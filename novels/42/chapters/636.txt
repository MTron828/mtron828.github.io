Chapter 637 – How Do I Get To The Hallowed Grounds?

An enormous beam of saber energy had arrived behind Yang Ye.

Bang!

Yang Ye turned around and swung his sword, and then it was blasted into nothingness.

The mind of the yellow robed young man on the city wall was on the verge of exploding, and it became completely blank. Yang Ye actually won....

Yun Qingyao stared blankly at He Lianqi’s corpse in the distance, and she just gazed at it for a short while before she closed her eyes. Two clear streams of tears flowed down slowly.

You fool. Why did you follow me? Why? We said that we would fight the defiant profounders together....You fool. You’ve liked me since you were young, but you never dared to confess your feelings to me. Do you know that I like you as well? I would have definitely agreed if you confessed. Unfortunately, you never did. Even though it made me very angry, I still loved you....You asked me why I wanted to head to Profounder Continent to research formations. I’ll tell you now. It was because I didn’t want to be a burden to you during the fight with the defiant profounders....

A short while later, Yun Qingyao opened his eyes, and her eyes were crimson red and ferocious as she said, “Yang Ye, it was you who killed him! I’ll bury you and everyone related to you with him!”

Yang Ye waved his hand casually and took He Lianqi’s corpse. After that, he gazed at Yun Qingyao and said, “Then bring it on!”

“Slash!” Yun Qingyao practically roared as she gave the order.

“Slash....” The 360 skeletons swung their sabers, and then 360 strands of saber qi shot through the sky. They were like 360 shooting stars that shot through the sky and descended in Yang Ye’s direction.

A cold smile appeared on the corners of Yang Ye’s mouth, and then he stabbed the intent sword into the ground.

Bang!

The circle of light on the ground trembled before it shattered into pieces, and then the 7 stars in the sky instantly vanished. Moreover, the 360 strands of saber qi vanished along with the stars....

The formation was destroyed. Yang Ye flashed over to the skeletons, and then he waved his hand and placed them all within the Primordial Pagoda. Earlier, he’d noticed that the skeletons didn’t possess intelligence like Corpse Ancestor and the others. They had no consciousness at all and were just simple puppets!

Even though they couldn’t reveal the same strength in his hands, they were still very strong. At the very least, they wouldn’t be weaker to ordinary ninth rank Exalt Realm experts.

“Blood Sacrifice!” Meanwhile, Yun Qingyao’s voice resounded once more.

“AH!!!” Suddenly, countless shrill cries resounded from Immortal Qilin City, and it was extremely horrifying.

The young man was stunned, and he turned around to look at the city. At this moment, the city was enveloped in a mist of blood, and he could still faintly discern that some profounders were being devoured within the mist and transformed into blood that converged into the mist of blood in the sky.

“What’re you doing!?” At this moment, the young man couldn’t be bothered about feeling fearful of her, and he immediately berated. Presently, the Exalted Han Empire had lost the trust of most of its subjects, and it might become utterly infamous if another city were to be slaughtered.

“Could it be that you don’t want Yang Ye to die?” Yun Qingyao spoke calmly, “Do you think that your Exalted Han Empire will be able to exist in peace if Yang Ye is still alive?”

“Even then, you can’t....”

Yun Qingyao glanced coldly at him and said, “I’m not asking for your opinion, understand?”

The young man’s heart felt cold when he noticed her icy cold expression. At this moment, he finally recalled that she wasn’t someone whom he could offend because both her strength and background far surpassed his own!

Yun Qingyao’s gaze descended onto Yang Ye, and she said, “Yang Ye, I’ll make you pay the price!”

Yang Ye disregarded her and looked past her towards the mist of blood behind her. Countless shrill cries were still resounded from within it.

Yang Ye merely glanced at it before he turned around and walked away.

Everyone here was stunned. Even Yun Qingyao was slightly stunned. What’s he trying to do?

Yang Ye naturally intended to leave. He wasn’t an idiot. Even though he didn’t know what sort of tricks Yun Qingyao had up her sleeve, he was very clearly aware that she was definitely creating something terrifying. Moreover, it would definitely be even more terrifying than those skeletons from before. While he didn’t fear it, it wasn’t necessary for him to go head on against it!

In any case, his true objective was the capital of the Exalted Han Empire and not Immortal Qilin City.

Since this path towards the capital was difficult, then he could just use another!

“Yang Ye! Stop right there!” Yun Qingyao suddenly shouted when she saw Yang Ye’s figure going further and further away.

Yang Ye’s lips curled up. She really thinks too much of herself. Who does she think she is? Why would I listen to her?

“Yang Ye! Are you a man!” Her voice resounded once more.

Yang Ye still paid no attention to her. He waved his right hand and a sword appeared beneath his feet. He felt that it was completely pointless to argue with her.

“Yang Ye, you should just stay behind!” Suddenly, a voice resounded, and then a ray of white light instantly arrived before Yang Ye.

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly as he swiftly swung the intent sword, and an explosion resounded. The white light dispersed, and a throwing knife fell to the ground.

Yang Ye gazed towards the distance, and he saw that Mo Yixie had suddenly appeared there. However, Mo Yixie’s arm had recovered.

“I was still too late!” Mo Yixie glanced over, and then he shook his head and said, “I never expected that even Qingyao and Lianqi’s joint forces wouldn’t be able to kill you. Yang Ye, you’ve really surprised me.”

“I’m rather surprised that you came to give your life away as well!” said Yang Ye.

“I really am no match for you!” Mo Yixie said, “But Qingyao can kill you!”

“She has lost!” said Yang Ye.

Mo Yixie suddenly chuckled, and he didn’t continue on the topic. He said instead, “You know, regardless of whether it’s Zuo Dengfeng, Yao Ye, or He Lianqi, all of them shouldn’t have died here. Even if they did die, they should have died at the hands of the defiant profounders.”

“So you’re saying that I should have died instead?” Yang Ye chuckled.

Mo Yixie said, “Our Hallowed Grounds dispatched its forces to Profounder Continent mainly with the intention of converging the elites of the continent to resist the defiant profounders. But my Hallowed Grounds shouldn’t have dispatched those idiots. If they hadn’t been too arrogant and conceited, then my Hallowed Grounds wouldn’t have become mortal enemies with the southern territory!”

Yang Ye shook his head and grinned, “I’m someone who doesn’t like to look for trouble, but I’m not afraid of it. The Exalted Han Empire wanted to kill me, so I intend to destroy it. Now, the Hallowed Grounds wants to kill me, so I’ll destroy it. Of course, I know that my current strength is definitely insufficient, but you really don’t have to worry. The day will come when I possess the strength to do so, don’t you think so too?”

“You’re really arrogant!” Mo Yixie said, “Or I should say that you’re quite conceited. Trust me, you wouldn’t speak like that if you’ve witnessed the true strength of my Hallowed Grounds.”

“I was just a Labor Disciple in the past, but what about now?” Yang Ye smiled and said, “The matters of the world are constantly changing, right?”

Mo Yixie took a deep and long glance at Yang Ye before he said, “Do you know that if my Hallowed Grounds isn’t there to resist the defiant profounders once they emerge from the seal, then your Profounder Continent would be destroyed in an instant!”

Yang Ye smiled and said, “I believe that the first thing they do upon emerging from the seal would definitely be to deal with your Hallowed Grounds. After all, your Hallowed Grounds imprisoned them for 100,000 years, so how would they vent their resentment that has been accumulating for 100,000 years if they don’t slaughter the Hallowed Grounds? Don’t you think I’m right? So, your Hallowed Grounds should be the one to be worried!”

“Such malicious words!” Mo Yixie spoke solemnly, “The defiant profounders are the enemies of the entire human race....”

“What a joke!” Yang Ye interrupted Mo Yixie and said, “Up until now, your Hallowed Grounds has been my true enemy. As for the defiant profounders, they haven’t even looked for trouble with me. But your Hallowed Grounds has been ceaselessly trying to kill me. So, my first target right now isn’t the defiant profounders but the Hallowed Grounds!”

Mo Yixie fell silent because... he was really at a loss for words.

Yang Ye suddenly said, “Do you know why I’ve been wasting my breath with you even though I know that you’re buying time for that woman?”

Mo Yixie’s eyelids twitched before he said, “I’m very curious about that as well!”

“How do I get to the Hallowed Grounds?” asked Yang Ye. The Sword Spirit used to know how to get to the Hallowed Grounds. But 100,000 years had passed, and it had truly been too long.... It was so long that the Sword Spirit merely remembered a rough direction and had forgotten the exact way. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Yang Ye had to travel to the Hallowed Grounds. Of course, he wouldn’t head over openly because the Monarch Realm and Half-Saint Realm experts there wouldn’t abide by the rules that experts at the Monarch Realm and above couldn’t act against him.

The corners of Mo Yixie’s eyes twitched, and he said, “Don’t tell me that you intend to attack the Hallowed Grounds!”

Yang Ye shook his head and said, “I’m just asking. You wouldn’t mind telling me about it, right? In any case, it’s impossible for me to be a threat to the Hallowed Grounds, right?”

“There’s an island at the end of the southern ocean, and there’s a teleportation formation there. You’ll be able to arrive at the Hallowed Grounds by entering that teleportation formation. Of course, the precondition is that you’re able to survive today!” Mo Yixie didn’t conceal it and spoke truthfully. Just as Yang Ye had said, he didn’t think Yang Ye could be a threat to the Hallowed Grounds unless Yang Ye attained the Half-Saint Realm!

“The end of the southern ocean?” Yang Ye nodded and said, “I’ll remember that!”

“Unfortunately, you won’t have a chance to head there anymore!” Meanwhile, Yun Qingyao’s voice suddenly resounded from above the city wall.

Yang Ye turned around and looked over. At this moment, an almost 3km long sword of blood had appeared in the sky above the city. The sword didn’t have a hilt, and it only had a body and blade. It emanated a monstrous aura of blood and evil, and Yang Ye could sense it with absolute clarity even from so far away.

“Yang Ye, you’re really too conceited.” Mo Yixie suddenly said, “The reason Qingyao is ranked at the 7th position is because it takes a huge amount of time to set up her formations. But no one would give her such time during a battle. If she is able to meticulously set up her formations to deal with her enemies, then not to mention you, even a ninth rank Monarch Realm expert would perish before her!”

Yang Ye shook his head and smiled, “This is what both of you are relying on?”

As soon as he finished speaking, a strand of Sword Intent surged out from within him, and then Mo Yixie and Yun Qingyao’s expressions instantly changed drastically....
