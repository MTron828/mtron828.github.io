Chapter 1368 – I Don’t Want To Lose, Nor Can I Afford To!

“Young Master Yang, there’s no need to be so aggressive!” Meanwhile, the beautiful woman, the eldest young miss, walked over to Yang Ye and smiled sweetly, “My Azure Cloud Merchant Group holds no ill intent towards you. Everything that occurred earlier was just a misunderstanding.”

As she spoke, she flicked a golden card over to Yang Ye and said, “That’s my Azure Cloud Merchant Group’s Gold VIP Card. Young Master Yang will be able to enjoy special privileges when buying from my merchant group from now on.”

Yang Ye didn’t speak. Ye Liuyun took the card and said, “Thank you for the gift, Eldest Young Miss. May I know your name?”

“Nangong Qin!” The beautiful woman smiled, “Sister Liuyun, you can look for me if you need anything in the future. I’ve been in Stellar City for a long time, so I’m much more familiar with everything here.”

Ye Liuyun smiled, “Thank you!”

Nangong Qin smiled, “Then I won’t disturb both of you further.”

Ye Liuyun nodded, and then turned around and walked to Yang Ye’s side. Yang Ye didn’t speak and just led her into Divine Sky Pavilion.

Once Yang Ye and Ye Liuyun entered Divine Sky Pavilion, Nangong Qin gazed at the second young miss and smiled, “Little sister, don’t look down on anymore. Besides that, we’re people who do business, so respecting others is very important. You actually tried to take a trusted subordinate away from him while he was watching, such disrespect is inadvisable.”

The second young miss’s face was completely icy cold, but she remained silent.

Nangong Qin smiled, “Are you thinking of gathering experts to vent your anger?”

The second young miss spoke coldly, “Isn’t that what you hoped that I would do?”

“Of course I do!” Nangong Qin smiled, “If you do that, then you won’t have another chance to fight me. It’s truly too boring to be by myself. So, allow me to give you a warning. Dark Hell Continent was once a sealed world, and the restriction that sealed it was something that even Semi-Deities couldn’t eliminate. Yet now, the seal is gone, and he came from within the continent.”

As soon as she finished speaking, Nangong Qin smiled and walked away.

The second young miss clenched her fists tightly.

Both she and Yue Tingyu had overlooked something, and it was that Dark Hell Continent had been covered by a restriction. Even Semi-Deities hadn’t been able to eliminate the restriction, yet Yang Ye had left that place. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

What did that represent?

It represented that it was very likely for the restrictions to have been destroyed by Yang Ye. If that was the truth, then Yang Ye’s strength was absolutely terrifying.

The second young miss remained silent on the spot for a long time, and then she looked up at Divine Sky Pavilion before turning around and leaving.

...

In Yang Ye’s room, Ye Liuyun asked, “Why were you so furious earlier?”

Yang Ye remained silent for a short while before he said, “Liuyun, I noticed something. Many people in this world are fools. I treat them with respect and respect them, yet they think that it’s because I fear them and try to take a yard when given an inch. Conversely, if I use force against them, they are even more respectful instead.”

Ye Liuyun said, “Humans naturally fear the strong and bully the weak!”

Yang Ye nodded, “So, the fist is the most efficient in this world. If you don’t have strength, then even if you kneel down and lick a person’s boots, that person would still not respect you. However, if you have strength, that same person would kneel and lick your boots instead.”

Yang Ye chuckled when he spoke up to this point and said, “Liuyun, you know what I gained the deepest realization on throughout my life?”

Ye Liuyun asked, “What?”

“Strength!” Yang Ye smiled, “A man can’t do without it. If a man has no strength, that man will have no dignity. Not to mention anyone else, even your own loved ones may look down upon you. Of course, such thoughts are a little extreme, but it’s reality.” As he spoke, he glanced at her and continued, “If I lost my cultivation and became an ordinary person, would you still help me as you have?”

Yang Ye continued before Ye Liuyun could answer him, “If I have no strength, then many people I care about will leave me. So, I’ve been ceaselessly forcing myself to grow stronger throughout these years. No matter how bitter it was, I still gritted my teeth and persisted. Because I don’t want to lose, nor can I afford to!”

Ye Liuyun asked in a soft voice, “What did you experience in the past?”

Yang Ye smiled, “A friend of mine once said that I should absolutely not complain to a woman. Because it would seem like I’m looking for pity, and it would seem like I’m acting. So, let’s end this topic. Go find out when the teleportation formation will be repaired. I can’t wait to go back.”

Ye Liuyun nodded, turned around, and started walking away. Suddenly, she stopped and said, “I have a thought.”

Yang Ye asked, “What?”

She replied, “Stellar City is where all worlds intersect, and it’s extremely prosperous. However, we know practically nothing about it. So, I want to stay here and expand our Sword Alliance here.”

Yang Ye asked, “You want to stay?”

Ye Liuyun replied, “It depends on you.”

Yang Ye remained silent for a while before he nodded, “You can stay.”

Actually, there was no need for Ye Liuyun to head to the Radiant Dimension with him. After all, she couldn’t fight, and it was impossible for her to expand the Sword Alliance to the Radiant Dimension. Since it was like that, it was better for her to stay behind and expand the Sword Alliance to Stellar City.

So long as she had sufficient funds, Ye Liuyun definitely had the ability to gain a foothold for the Sword Alliance in Stellar City.

Ye Liuyun nodded, turned around, and left.

Once Ye Liuyun left, Yang Ye opened his grasp and there were 3 spatial rings there. They naturally belonged to the 3 old men he’d just killed. Yang Ye hadn’t wanted to kill in Stellar City because he wasn’t familiar with the place and didn’t want to cause trouble. After all, his main objective was to return to the Radiant Dimension!

However, those old men wanted to look for trouble with him. Since they acted like that, he would naturally not hold back.

Yang Ye glanced through their contents. There were 10,000 divine crystals or 1,000,000 violet crystals within them. A million violet crystals could be considered to be a huge amount, and he would definitely feel extremely excited in the past. Yet now.... He’d just won 100,000 divine crystals just now!

Besides divine crystals, there were quite a few other miscellaneous items like techniques and treasures. However, they weren’t able to arouse Yang Ye’s interest. Everything he wore was at the Void Rank at the very least. It could be said that treasures beneath the Void Rank were beneath him. But while they were beneath him, he could give them to Ye Liuyun to be sold for some divine crystals!

Yang Ye put the spatial rings away, glanced at the surroundings, and then summoned a Voider Realm Sword Servant. He’d had 5 of them, but when Su Qingshi and the others decided to stay on Dark Hell Continent, he’d left 2 to them in order to guarantee their safety. So, he only had one left with him.

Yang Ye ordered it to guard the door before he sat cross-legged on the ground, and then he entered the Primordial Pagoda.

He intended to cultivate!

As always, he didn’t want to waste even a moment.

Even though he’d attained the Emperor Realm and his strength had improved tremendously in all aspects, it was still far insufficient to him. Moreover, he’d rushed a little when advancing into the Emperor Realm that day. So, for the sake of preventing his foundation from becoming unstable, he hadn’t just been cultivating lately, he’d been ceaselessly solidifying his foundation.

Yang Ye attached great importance to his foundation. It was like building a tower. If the foundation wasn’t solid, it might be fine in the beginning, but problems would arise incessantly as time went by, and those problems would grow more and more obvious. In the end, the tower might collapse. So, he couldn’t act carelessly when dealing with his foundation!

Time trickled by. 2 days later, Yang Ye returned to the world outside. 2 days had passed in reality, but 20 days had passed in the Primordial Pagoda!

It was a difference of 10 times!

It was absolutely heaven defying!

Yang Ye was very well aware that if news of it were to spread, the experts of this universe would definitely come looking for him. Just thinking about being chased by countless experts made a chill run down Yang Ye’s spine!

Yang Ye shook his head, restrained his thoughts, and said, “Come in!”

The door was pushed open and Ye Liuyun walked in.

Yang Ye asked, “Has the teleportation formation been repaired?”

She nodded, “It has. Our forces are ready and can set out at any moment.”

Yang Ye nodded, and then he pointed at the Voider Realm Sword Servant, “It’ll stay with you. Be careful in the city.”

Ye Liuyun asked, “Is the Radiant Dimension dangerous?”

Yang Ye replied, “I don’t know. I don’t know anything about the Alliance of Guardians.”

Ye Liuyun asked, “I’ve sent our forces to investigate. Do you want to wait for the information before going?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “No, I don’t want to wait anymore. Let’s go.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye walked out of the room and Ye Liuyun quickly followed him.

After they left Divine Sky Pavilion, Ye Liuyun led them to the teleportation platforms in Stellar City.

However, a terrifying aura suddenly appeared in the distance when they were about to enter the teleportation formation, and it charged rapidly towards them.

It was a hostile aura!

The profound energy within Lin Qian and the others started to circulate.

It didn’t take long for a black robed old man to appear before them.

A Semi-Deity!

The old man’s gaze descended upon Yang Ye, “I was almost too late. You’re the one who took something from my Alliance of Guardians and killed our experts, right?”

Yang Ye asked, “You’re from the Alliance of Guardians?”

The old man spoke fiercely, “Kid, you stole from us and spoiled our plans. You caused our army to be unable to get to Clouds of Heaven Stellar Region in time! Moreover, you even made me travel through numerous stellar regions to come look for you. You....”

When the old man spoke up to this point, Yang Ye suddenly drew his sword and swung it.

Om!

A sword howl resounded while a ray of sword energy shot out from Yang Ye’s ancient sheath.

The true form of Heavenrend!

After he swung his sword, Yang Ye just walked towards the teleportation formation while he spoke, “Don’t waste time. Let’s go.”

The others glanced at the black robed old man, and then hurriedly followed Yang Ye into the teleportation formation,

Meanwhile, the black robed old man seemed like a statue and didn’t move a muscle.

Hiss!

A few breaths of time later, his body split open from the center!
