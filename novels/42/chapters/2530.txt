Aren’t you Yang Ye?

This time, Yang Ye was flabbergasted. Elder Xue knows who I am?

A long time passed before Yang Ye spoke solemnly, “All of you know?”

She gazed at him for a long time and asked, “What do you think?”

Yang Ye asked, “When?”

Elder Xue replied indifferently, “Not long ago.”

Yang Ye asked, “How many are aware?”

Elder Xue replied, “Just the Grand Elder and I know in the sect.”

As if she knew what Yang Ye was thinking, Elder Xue smiled, “Don’t think too much about it. You’re very, very well-known in Eternal Border, but not in Eternal Kingdom. Besides the higher-ups of the top powers, practically everyone else is unaware of who Yang Ye is. As for the Grand Elder and I, we didn’t hear about you because of you, it’s because of the Sprite Progenitor!”

Yang Ye smiled, “So I’m still safe?”

Elder Xue replied solemnly, “Your background is too suspicious. Because someone like you didn’t exist in Eternal Kingdom before this. So, we used the sect’s resources to investigate you, but we failed to find out anything. Thus, the Sect Master sent people to Eternal Border.”

Yang Ye glanced at Elder Xue, “I’m Yang Ye, yet you still want me to be the sect master?”

She shook her head slightly, “You must realize that while some in Eternal Kingdom wish to kill you and obtain the Sprite Progenitor, it’s only a small number of people and not the entire Eternal Kingdom. Right?”

Yang Ye fell silent.

Elder Xue added, “Up until now, the Ancient Sword Sect hasn’t sent anyone to kill you, and we’ve always maintained a neutral attitude toward you. After all, you have the Sprite Progenitor, and it’s linked to Eternal Kingdom’s future.”

She walked over to him and continued, “You must understand that Eternal Kingdom doesn’t belong to a single person or power. There are many voices here, and until you join the desolate race to attack Eternal Kingdom, the Ancient Sword Sect and some other powers won’t treat you as an enemy. After all, a Sprite Progenitor is willing to stay with you, so as far as we’re concerned, you’re definitely not someone evil!”

Yang Ye smiled, “Even then, aren’t you afraid that the other powers will target the sect because of me?”

She looked him in the eyes, “That depends on you. You’re right, perhaps they will target us. But some other powers may display goodwill. No one knows what will actually happen.”

Yang Ye looked out of the bamboo house, and he felt quite lost.

Meanwhile, Elder Xue had left the house. Obviously, she was giving him time to think!

In the room, Sword Scroll appeared by Yang Ye’s side. She glanced at where the sect master had taken his last breath, but there was no change in her expression.

A short while later, she gazed at Yang Ye, “She’s right. Only some powers in Eternal Kingdom are acting against you and not the entire Eternal Kingdom. For example, the Ancient Sword Sect didn’t target you, and they want to take your side instead.”

Yang Ye shook his head, “I don’t want to be the sect master. Moreover, I’m not made for it!”

Sword Scroll replied solemnly, “If you don’t be the sect master and let someone else do it, then that person may lead the Ancient Sword Sect to become your enemy. I know you’re not afraid, but if you take control of the Ancient Sword Sect, it represents that you’ll have help. I’m sure you’re seen the resources and reserves possessed by the sect. If the Ancient Sword Sect is on your side, then even if your identity is exposed, those powers will have to really consider the consequences of targeting you!”

Yang Ye gazed at her and smiled, “Do you want me to become the sect master that badly?”

She nodded.

Yang Ye was quite curious, “Why?”

She fell silent.

Yang Ye spoke softly, “You can’t let go of this place, right?”

She nodded slightly, “The seniors of the Ancient Sword Sect used the resources of the entire sect to create me. This place is my home, and I’ve never forgotten the kindness they showed me when creating me. They made me, but they didn’t use me. My status in the sect was very great and only inferior to the sect master, and even the sect master had to be polite to me. I-I don’t want the Ancient Sword Sect to go into decline. Especially at a time like this when he is dead. The sect will definitely fall into a dangerous situation.”

Yang Ye laughed bitterly, “You think I can save this sect? Or perhaps you think I can help it rise up once again?”

Sword Scroll replied solemnly, “At the very least, the Ancient Sword Sect won’t be cowardly! Even if it suffers a decline, it won’t be a cowardly declined sect!”

Yang Ye gazed at her and remained silent.

Meanwhile, Sword Scroll added, “In any case, Snowy and the others aren’t back yet, and the desolate race hasn’t attacked. So just be the sect master for now, alright?”

Yang Ye was quite tempted by this.

While he didn’t like to be shackled, he felt that being the sect master wasn’t disadvantageous either! While he would have to face some issues, the benefits were obvious as well!

Meanwhile, Sword Scroll continued, “If you take control of the Ancient Sword Sect, you can bring those girls from the Nether Pavilion here. Not just them, you can bring some of your friends here too, like Elder Mu and the others. The Ancient Sword Sect is an extraordinary power, and it can be a safe home for them.”

Yang Ye fell silent for a long time as he gazed at the ring before him. In the end, he wore it.

Just like that, Yang Ye became the youngest master of the Ancient Sword Sect!

The Sect Master!

Meanwhile, Elder Xue and the Grand Elder walked into the bamboo house. They seemed slightly relieved when they saw Yang Ye wearing the ring. Of course, there were also some complicated emotions in them.

Actually, as far as they were concerned, Yang Ye wasn’t suitable, or it should be said that he wasn’t suitable right now. However, the previous sect master had given a firm order. So, while they were quite hesitant about his choice, they still decided to obey his orders!

It was because his contribution to the sect had been too great!

Now, when they saw Yang Ye wear the ring, they couldn’t help but feel slightly lost toward the sect’s future.

The young man before him was no different than a child to them!

Yang Ye glanced at them and said, “Do we have to keep the previous sect master’s death a secret?”

Elder Xue shook her head, “It’s impossible to keep a secret.”

Yang Ye nodded slightly and said, “How’s the investigation on the Soul Sect going?”

Elder Xue replied, “Put that aside for now. Now, there are two important matters to deal with. Firstly, it’s to announce the previous sect master’s death, and the second is you!”

Yang Ye was quite puzzled, “Me?”

Elder Xue nodded, “You’re the sect master now, and that requires a process, a ceremony. At that time, the other powers and some powers in the West Region will come to congratulate you.”

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and asked, “Can we just skip those useless procedures?”

Elder Xue shook her head, “It must be done. Only then will you truly be acknowledged as the sect master. Moreover, if you don’t hold the ceremony, my Ancient Sword Sect and the countless other subordinate sects of ours will not acknowledge you.”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and asked, “What if no one comes, wouldn’t that be really embarrassing?”

Elder Xue glanced at him and said, “It probably won’t be that bad!”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

Just like that, an absolutely shocking piece of news swept through Eternal Kingdom three days later!

The previous sect master of the Ancient Sword Sect had passed away!

The previous sect master of the Ancient Sword Sect had participated in the war all those years ago, and he and the Super Divine Treasure of the Ancient Sword Sect were existences that instilled terrors into those who had ill intent toward the sect. Yet now, he was gone.

What was the Ancient Sword Sect’s future?

But it didn’t take long for another piece of news to spread, a new sect master had appeared!

Ye Yang!

It was undoubtedly an extremely unfamiliar name to the entire Eternal Kingdom. Of course, that wasn’t the most important thing, the most important thing was that Ye Yang was very young!

He was the youngest sect master in the history of the Ancient Sword Sect!

As for the most shocking part about it, Sect Master Ye Yang was actually just a Three World Realm expert!

The Three World Realm!

For a time, the Ancient Sword Sect had practically become the laughingstock of the entire Eternal Kingdom.

They were saying that Ye Yang was an illegitimate child of the previous sect master!

It could be said that the announcement of these two things from the Ancient Sword Sect had caused quite a tremor through Eternal Kingdom!

On this day, Yang Ye wore an elegant violet robe, and his hair hung down to his shoulder… It was Elder Xue who dressed him up like this, and it was so he looked a little more mature!

Yang Ye was extremely annoyed by this!

In the main hall of the Ancient Sword Sect, Yang Ye sat at the seat of the host. From this seat, he could see to the bottom of the stairs outside the hall. Today, he was going to entertain the various powers who came to congratulate him!

It felt very uncomfortable!

It was extremely uncomfortable for Yang Ye, but besides that, he felt it was quite fun!

After so many years of cultivating and traveling the world, he’d never experienced something like this!

A short while later, the Grand Elder led a group of sword cultivators into the hall. There were around 200 of them, and they weren’t weak. There were quite a few at the Five World Realm among them!T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

They bowed slightly to Yang Ye in unison, “Sect Master!”

Yang Ye nodded and spoke in a mature manner, “At ease!”

They glanced at him with a rather weird expression on their faces!

What a young sect master!

Of course, most of them were rather displeased. Becoming the sect master at the Three World Realm? Then wouldn’t experts at the Four World Realm and Five World Realm like them be capable of being the Eternal Lord?

While many thought like that, they didn’t dare to say anything. After all, Elder Xue and the Grand Elder were still here!

Yang Ye glanced at the disciples of the Ancient Sword Sect and smiled, “I know what you’re thinking. Since you don’t like it, why don’t you step forward and say it?”

As he spoke, he walked over to them, “If you’re unhappy, then be a man and say it out loud!”

They exchanged glances.

The Grand Elder and Elder Xue glanced at Yang Ye but didn’t say anything.

Yang Ye smiled, “What? Are the disciples of my Ancient Sword Sect this cowardly?”

Suddenly, a man stepped forward and looked Yang Ye in the eyes, “I refuse to accept this!”

Yang Ye nodded, “That’s an illness. But that’s fine. I’ve always been a specialist at things like this!”
