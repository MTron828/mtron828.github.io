Chapter 1720 - Lu Clan’s Patriarch, Come Chat With Me!

The Stellar Sword Diagram!

Even though it wasn’t a True Rank treasure, it still was extremely useful to Yang Ye.

Because while the Stellar Sword Diagram wasn’t a True Rank treasure, it was more useful than one when it was combined with his current strength. Because the Stellar Sword Diagram was made for sword cultivators!

Its strength was determined by the strength of its user!

Now, his current strength wasn’t just sufficient to utilize it with ease, he could even bring its might to its limits!

The stellar sword energy in space descended like a dense rain towards Skyfire City.

They were extremely swift and only took an instant to arrive above the city.

The faces of those experts from the Lu Clan had instantly turned gloomy when they saw the sword energy. They hadn’t expected Yang Ye to actually dare to run wild right in front of the Lu Clan!

Right when the sword energy was about to descend upon the city, a voice resounded from within the city, “Activate the formation!”

As soon as the voice finished resounding, a huge flaming barrier of light appeared in the sky, and it instantly enveloped the city.

It didn’t take long for the stellar sword energy to descend upon the barrier of light.

Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!

Explosions resounded incessantly through the sky, and the entire city started to tremble.

Yang Ye gazed at the sky for a long time, and then he waved his right hand and put the Stellar Sword Diagram away. Once the Stellar Sword Diagram vanished, the stellar sword energy in the sky vanished as well, and the area returned to normal.

The only reason Yang Ye had stopped the attack was because the stellar sword energy wasn’t able to break through the formation around Skyfire City.

But it did make sense. Even though the Lu Clan wasn’t as strong as the Yang Clan, it was still one of the eight clans. So, as the Lu Clan’s main city, the formation around Skyfire City was definitely not that easy to destroy.

The old man who led the group suddenly spoke fiercely, “Yang Ye, you killed the successor of my Lu Clan. My Lu Clan didn’t intend to search for you just to get even with you, but we never expected you to actually come to us. Since that’s the case, don’t blame us for showing no mercy!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he took a step forward, and then two small black iron balls appeared in his right grasp. After that, they each formed a black pillar of light that shot at Yang Ye.

Yang Ye’s face remained calm. At this moment, he finally understood why the Lu Clan was acting against him. It was because of their successor. The Lu Clan’s successor had been helping Yang Ru that day, and he’d died at Yang Ye’s hands.

The Lu Clan’s successor dying at Yang Ye’s hands was definitely a humiliation for the Lu Clan, so it was understandable that the Lu Clan hated him.

Yang Ye shook his head. His left hand moved slightly, and then his sword shot forward.

Hiss! Hiss!

The black pillars of light were instantly sliced into two, and then they vanished in midair.

The Laws of Decay!

Every single attack of his carried the Laws of Decay!

The old man’s face fell when he saw Yang Ye destroy his attack with such ease. Yang Ye’s strength was much stronger than he’d expected.

They knew a little about Yang Ye’s strength. Because everything Yang Ye did in the Yang Clan was no secret to the other clans. However, at this moment, they noticed that Yang Ye wasn’t really the same as the information they’d received!

But it didn’t matter to them. Because they were in the Lu Clan’s territory!

No matter how monstrous a Zenith Realm expert was, what was the worst such an expert could do?

So, once he thought up to this point, the old man’s gaze turned icy cold, “Yang Ye, since you’ve come, then you don’t have to leave. It just so happens that I’m quite tempted by the Yang Clan’s rewards as well! Kill him! I want him dead, not alive!”

Suddenly, Yang Ye turned around, and then he transformed into a ray of light that vanished into the sky.

He fled?

All of them were stunned!

Yang Ye actually fled?

Needless to say, they were caught off guard by this development.

“Get him!” The old man immediately intended to chase after Yang Ye once he gave the order. However, a black robed old man by his side said, “Elder Lu Gu, it might be a trap!”

“A trap?” The old man, Lu Gu, laughed coldly, “There’s six of us here. Why would we fear him?”

The black robed old man replied, “He has trump cards!”

Lu Gu said, “Isn’t it just a mysterious arm? Didn’t you see? He didn’t use his right hand. If I’m not wrong, he’s definitely suffering from side-effects after the battle in the Yang Clan. Presently, he’s definitely unable to utilize that mysterious arm. Alright, if you’re afraid, then don’t come with us.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Lu Gu immediately vanished into the sky.

The black robed old man hesitated for a moment, and then he followed Lu Gu with the others.

Yang Ye flew swiftly on his sword, and it didn’t take long for him to leave Skyfire System and arrive in the boundless starry sky. Actually, he could go even faster, but he hadn’t risen it to his limits!

As for the reason, it was naturally because he was waiting for them!

It didn’t take long for Yang Ye to stop, and then Lu Gu’s group of six appeared not too far behind him after just three breaths of time passed.

Yang Ye turned to look at them. The black robed old man by Lu Gu’s side spoke solemnly, “It’s definitely a trap. Be care…”

Suddenly, the black robed old man’s expression changed drastically. He stomped his right foot down and vanished on the spot.

Hiss!

The old man had vanished on the spot, but an arm floated where he had been standing.

It was the old man’s arm!

Silence instantly filled the surroundings.

Lu Gu and the others’ eyes were filled with shock. They hadn’t expected that Yang Ye would be able to immediately take one of the black robed old man’s arms! It was especially so for the black robed old man himself. Besides shock, there was deep fear in his eyes!

If he hadn’t reacted quickly just now, it wouldn’t have been just an arm that he lost, he would have lost his life!

What a swift attack!

At this moment, Lu Gu and the others had solemn expressions in their eyes as they gazed at Yang Ye!

Yang Ye shook his head. He felt that his technique, Split Second, was still not strong enough because it couldn’t kill True Realm experts in an instant. The reaction of True Realm experts was too swift, and it should be said that their instinct towards danger was too strong. So, they were always able to dodge his attack at the critical moment!

It wasn’t strong enough!

He knew that he had to train more!

His technique wasn’t at its limits yet, and it could grow stronger. So long as his skill in utilizing those five Laws of his improved, then the speed and strength of Split Second would rise a level higher as well.

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts and started walking in Lu Gu’s group’s direction!

Pressure!

He’d grown fond of exerting such pressure on others!

It could give his opponents mental pressure, and it could make him more imposing. It was an imposing aura that disregarded the world and looked down upon the world!

Lu Gu and the others’ eyelids twitched when they saw Yang Ye start walking in their direction. Surprisingly, none of them attacked.

Yang Ye was still walking slowly, and the atmosphere here was growing heavier and heavier.

It was oppressive!

Lu Ge and the others felt oppressed! It was pressure that struck straight at the heart!

“He’s creating an imposing aura for himself!” Suddenly, the black robed old man spoke abruptly, “We can’t fight him! Retreat!”

“We can’t?” Lu Gu spoke angrily, “We have six True Realm experts here, yet you’re telling me that we can’t fight a Zenith Realm cultivator? If news of this were to spread, our Lu Clan will become the laughingstock of the world. Attack with me!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he charged at Yang Ye. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

The black robed old man shook his head, “Fool!”

He vanished on the spot once he finished speaking.

As soon as Yang Ye launched that attack just now, he understood that Yang Ye wasn’t the same person that was described on the information their clan had received. At this moment, Yang Ye was a peerlessly monstrous genius, and ordinary True Realm experts weren’t capable of facing such monstrous geniuses!

So, he’d chosen to leave!

He had to notify the Lu Clan that Yang Ye wasn’t the same Yang Ye anymore!

Only five people remained here.

Lu Gu and the others were extremely fast. They instantly arrived around Yang Ye, and then five powerful auras belonging to True Realm experts slammed down in Yang Ye’s direction.

Aura!

True Realm experts would usually use their auras in battle. The expert with the stronger aura would naturally gain an advantage in battle. Now, they had five auras on their side!

Yang Ye’s expression didn’t change at all when the auras of five True Realm experts slammed down towards him, and he didn’t release his sword intent and slaughter intent.

Yang Ye just stabbed his sword forward.

Bang!

Their auras instantly collapsed!

He’d struck at the weak point of their auras!

After he did that, Yang Ye vanished on the spot, and then a ray of light flashed.

Only a ray of light could be seen, and a sword howl was heard, but Yang Ye’s figure was nowhere to be seen!

Both his speed and strength were at a terrifying level. Especially Yang Ye’s speed. It was the product of the fusion of many Laws, and it made his speed far surpass True Realm experts!

Three breaths of time later.

The surroundings suddenly fell silent, but the light from Yang Ye’s attacks hadn’t vanished.

Yang Ye didn’t continue attacking. There were two bloody heads not too far in front of him while Lu Gu and the other two who remained weren’t in good shape. All three of them had suffered varying degrees of injuries. Especially Lu Gu, one of his arms was gone.

Even though all of them were True Realm experts, based on Yang Ye’s estimations, they were 2nd stage True Realm experts at most. They were much more inferior when compared to Yang Shun’s group from that day. Otherwise, it would have been impossible for him to fight five 3rd stage True Realm experts on his own!

Yang Ye withdrew an Energy Pearl and consumed it, and then he was about to attack. However, Lu Gu suddenly said, “Retreat!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he turned around and vanished on the spot.

The other two True Realm experts followed closely behind him!

Yang Ye was stunned.

They fled just like that?

Yang Ye fell silent for a few breaths of time, and then he shook his head and vanished on the spot.

Around 10 minutes later, Yang Ye appeared outside Skyfire City again.

Yang Ye walked slowly towards the city while holding a sword in his grasp. At the same time, his voice resounded through the city, “Lu Clan’s Patriarch, come chat with me!”
