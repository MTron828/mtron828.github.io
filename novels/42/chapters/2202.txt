Chapter 2203 – Quite Outstanding!

Surrender or die!

Meanwhile, one of the undying cavalry behind the masked woman asked, “Lord Exalt, why are we taking prisoners?”

The masked woman replied indifferently, “Now that my undying race has returned here, we naturally have to reorganize this world, and we need some slaves to do that.”

“Understood!” The undying cavalry nodded and left.

The news of the undying race’s return didn’t take long to spread throughout the large universe.

However, many were bewildered.

Especially the Alliance of All. They knew nothing about the undying race. As far as the Alliance of All was concerned, it was just a mysterious organization. So, they ignored the order given out by the undying race!

As for the three paths, their reaction was completely different.

As soon as the undying race returned, the three progenitors had converged together, and no one knew what they were discussing. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

…

The prehistoric ruins.

In the hall, the masked woman sat at the seat of the host, and 600 undying cavalries were below, standing on both sides. As for by her side, there was a phantom there. This phantom was the same mysterious expert who Yang Ye had come into contact with on many occasions.

A long period of silence went on in the hall before the masked woman suddenly stood up, “Looks like we’ll have to make an example. Which are the strongest powers in the large universe right now?”

“The three paths!” The phantom continued, “The Dao Path, Buddhist Path, and Weapon Path. If you want to make a show of strength, you can destroy the Buddhist Path and Weapon Path!”

The masked woman gazed at the phantom, “What about the Dao Path?”

The phantom replied, “The Dao Path’s ancestor wasn’t injured, but the Buddhist Path and Weapon Path’s ancestors are. So, it’ll be easier to destroy them. Of course, with your strength, even their joint forces are nothing to you. However, you’ve just awakened from your slumber, and your body hasn’t fully recovered. Even your Undying Energy isn’t at its peak yet. So, we should be careful!”

“Careful?” The masked woman spoke indifferently, “What? After so many years of laying low in the large universe, the dignified Grand Protector is so cowardly now?”

The phantom denied that, “Lord Exalt, the void spirit race may be gone, but the living beings here aren’t that ordinary. I personally suggest we act carefully and avoid making the same mistake again!”

The same mistake!

No one knew what kind of memories those words awakened within her, but a gloomy aura swept out from her, and the entire prehistoric ruins instantly became cold!

“Void Spirit Maiden!” The masked woman closed her eyes slowly, “While we were enemies, she… really was outstanding. But how many people like her can exist in this entire universe?”

She started walking slowly out of the hall.

600 undying cavalries were behind her!

Meanwhile, her voice came from outside the hall, “Just 100 is enough!”

It didn’t take long for 100 to leave and 500 to stay.

In the hall, the phantom shook their head and remained silent.

Even now, the phantom still couldn’t forget two people. One was the armless man, and the other was the middle aged man in a cloud white robe. Especially the latter, the latter’s strength… was simply capable of being described as unfathomable!

…

The Buddhist Path.

On this day, the clear sky suddenly darkened, and then 100 women with spears on their backs and ferocious beasts below them appeared in the sky above the Buddhist Dimension. They were led by the masked woman.

Bang!

A terrifying aura surged up from within the Buddhist Dimension, and then a huge golden holy statue appeared before them.

It was in the image of the Buddhist Progenitor!

It wasn’t his real body!

The Buddhist Progenitor glanced at them and was about to speak when a spear shot up from behind the masked woman.

Hiss!

An instant later, the Buddhist Progenitor’s figure collapsed.

The masked woman waved her head slightly, “Leave none alive!”

Leave none alive!

The undying cavalries behind her immediately charged down, and then spear images descended like a meteor shower toward every inch of the Buddhist Dimension. After that, shrill cries resounded incessantly.

Suddenly, a huge golden palm stretched out from the clouds, and it slammed down at the masked woman down below.

She looked up, and then a spear shot up from behind her. An instant later, she was behind the spear and stabbed it forward.

Bang!

The golden palm instantly exploded apart.

An instant later, she hurled her spear to the right.

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!

Four Sages from the Buddhist Path were instantly skewered and killed over 10km away.

She’d killed four Sages with a single hurl of the spear.

Suddenly, a ray of golden holy light suddenly shot up from underground, and then countless rays of holy light slammed at the masked woman and the undying cavalries. The powerful holy light swept toward them in waves, and the powerful energy it carried caused the entire Buddhist Dimension to turn ethereal.

A cold smile curled up on the corners of the masked woman’s mouth. She placed her hands on the swords by her waist, and then she drew them and threw them forward.

Hiss! Hiss!

Two rays of light flashed like a shooting star and entered the holy light.

Boom! Boom!

A moment of silence ensued before they sliced open the holy light and took just an instant to stab into the ground.

Boom! Boom!

Two explosions resounded from deep underground, and then the entire Buddhist Dimension started to tremble.

It was collapsing!

The entire Buddhist Dimension was collapsing like a porcelain jar struck by a hammer!

Suddenly, almost 1,000 disciples of the Buddhist Path shot up into outer space.

Flee!

The masked woman glanced indifferently at them and was about to attack when an old man in a Daoist’s robes suddenly appeared in front of her.

The Dao Progenitor!

The Dao Progenitor didn’t say a word, and he just tapped his finger forward.

The space before him rippled, and then three rays of green energy appeared before the masked woman.

Bang! Bang! Bang!

They exploded apart, and the powerful force of the explosion pushed the woman over 10km away.

Suddenly, the Dao Progenitor took a step forward and waved the horsetail whisk in his grasp.

Hiss!

In an instant, the entire surroundings turned ethereal.

Bang!

The masked woman was instantly blasted over 3km away.

However, the Dao Progenitor didn’t stop there. He took another step forward, and a white lotus bloomed beneath his foot. Once the first lotus bloomed, the entire Buddhist Dimension was suddenly covered in white lotuses. Or to be more precise, the entire Buddhist Dimension was like a pool with countless lotuses in it!

Meanwhile, the Dao Progenitor formed a seal, “Lotus World!”

Boom!

As soon as he said that, all the lotuses bloomed, and then the entire Buddhist Dimension exploded apart. The masked woman and the undying cavalries behind her were blasted out into outer space.

However, a ray of dark light suddenly shot down from space. An instant later, a spear appeared in front of the Dao Progenitor. The Dao Progenitor tapped his horsetail whisk at it, and it tapped against the tip of the spear.

Bang!

As soon as they came into contact, an explosion resounded. A terrifying wave of energy swept out and obliterated the space before it.

The Dao progenitor was blasted over 10km away.

An instant later, the masked woman appeared above the Dao Progenitor, and then she grabbed a spear with both hands and stabbed it down.

Hiss!

The ground below cracked open, and then dust and smoke shot up into the air.

Suddenly, the Dao Progenitor closed his eyes, “The Dao is Natural!”

Hiss!

As soon as he finished speaking, the spear pierced through the Dao Progenitor’s head, but he was completely unharmed.

At the same time, the surroundings shook violently like an earthquake. After that, strange energy which was invisible to the eye surged madly at the masked woman.

Bang! Bang! Bang!

Explosions resounded incessantly while the woman was blasted away.

Suddenly, she stopped herself, and then she stabbed her spear forward, “Destruction!”

Bang!

A huge black circle of light suddenly swept out with her at the center, and everything was devoured before it.

Rumble!

Explosions resounded incessantly.

The Dao Progenitor suddenly formed a seal, “Return of All!”

As soon as he said that, the surroundings suddenly fell silent. The black circle of light the woman emanated stopped as well. Moreover, the destroyed space in the surroundings had returned to normal again. Even more terrifying than that was that the destroyed ground below had actually been restored as well.

Suddenly, the Dao Progenitor spoke softly, “Destruction of All!”

Boom!

As soon as he said that, everything here exploded apart and turned in an expanse of pitch black.

Around 15 minutes later, only the masked woman remained here, and the undying cavalries were behind her!

The Dao Progenitor was gone!

She glanced at her hand and looked up at the sky, “Who was that?”

“The Dao Progenitor!” Meanwhile, a phantom appeared by her side, “The ancestor of the Dao Path. The only progenitor amongst the three Paths who wasn’t injured!”

The masked woman waved her hands, and two swords flew to her waist. She glanced at the direction that the Dao Progenitor had left toward, “Interesting. I’ll kill him once my Origin Soul is fully recovered!”

She turned around and left once she finished speaking.

However, she stopped after taking a few steps, “I heard there was an armless man who was attacked by five progenitors?”

The phantom nodded.

The masked woman asked, “He heavily injured them on his own?”

The phantom said, “Yes!”

The masked woman spoke indifferently, “But he merely heavily injured them. So he isn’t anything great!”

She started walking swiftly into the distance.

Suddenly, the phantom said, “He was injured at the time, and he only had around 50% of his strength left. Moreover, he had the desire to die. Otherwise, they wouldn’t have been able to kill him.”

The masked woman stopped, fell silent for a moment, and said, “He’s quite outstanding then!”

She vanished on the spot once she finished speaking.
