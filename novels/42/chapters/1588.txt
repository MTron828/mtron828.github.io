Chapter 1589 - Little Sky’s Help!

Translator: InVader

Blood Maiden glanced at Little Sky and remained silent. Little Sky was too mysterious, and she was very protective of this world. According to Blood Maiden’s inference, Little Sky may be a type of Sprite King or might even be close to the Lord of the Heaven Dao.

Yang Ye gazed at Little Sky, “Little Sky, if the Nether Pavilion attacks this universe, then are you going to protect it?”

“Of course!” Little Sky gazed at him and said, “This world gave birth to us and nurtured us, so shouldn’t we protect it?”

Yang Ye fell silent.

What she said did make sense. However, he was quite selfish. The first thing that came to mind when he heard Blood Maiden was his loved ones.

In his heart, his loved ones were always the most important!

However, if the Nether Pavilion attacked Merak System, he would definitely be unable to just leave. Because besides his loved ones, he still had many who were following him.

He couldn’t just put all of them in the Primordial Pagoda, right?

Moreover, he’d noticed that he couldn’t just freely transport others into the Primordial Pagoda. Even though the Primordial Pagoda acknowledged him, he didn’t have the strength to fully control it. Besides that, he didn’t dare to allow so many to enter the Primordial Pagoda. If news of it was leaked, the Nether Pavilion wouldn’t be coming to look for trouble with the Lord of the Heaven Dao, they would be looking for him instead.

“This world can’t stop the Nether Pavilion!” Blood Maiden spoke abruptly, “Even though our strength has declined tremendously, most of our experts have returned. These experts are far from anything the people of this world can fight back against.”

Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly asked, “Why does the Nether Pavilion want to capture the Lord of the Heaven Dao alive?”

“To plunder, of course!” Little Sky spoke indifferently, “The Lord of the Heaven Dao is the caretaker of a universe. If the Lord of the Heaven Dao is captured, it’s equivalent to taking control of that corresponding universe, and then they can plunder the resources of that universe without any restraint.”

Blood Maiden fell silent.

Little Sky suddenly looked up at the sky, “Remember what I once told you?”

Yang Ye was slightly stunned, “What?”

Little Sky said, “Spirit energy and resources. The stronger a power is, the more resources and spirit energy it would require. Because gaining even more spirit energy and resources is the only way to sustain their growth. Once the resources and spirit energy in their home world isn’t sufficient, they will choose to invade, and then plunder other worlds.”

Blood Maiden nodded, ‘She’s right. The spirit energy where our Nether Pavilion is has started to grow more and more scarce. The spirit energy there isn’t sufficient for all the experts of our pavilion to cultivate.” She gazed at Yang Ye and continued, “Take your people and leave this world!”

“Leave?” A wisp of a lost expression flashed through Yang Ye’s eyes, “And go where?”

He could take Su Qingshi and the others with him and leave this universe. But what about the others? Besides that, he was very well aware that many wouldn’t be willing to leave. For example Zhuang Weiran. She would definitely not abandon Clouds of Heaven Stellar Region. There was the Sword Alliance in Dark Hell Continent too. Could he just abandon all of them?

He was a person who wouldn’t betray those who didn’t betray him. They’d followed him and trusted him, yet now that there was danger, he just took his loved ones and friends with him while leaving them to whatever fate awaited them? If he really did that, even he would look down on himself. He didn’t want to be a savior, but he didn’t one to be a heartless person as well.

He could act heartlessly towards his enemies, but could he do the same to those who followed him and trusted him?

In short, he couldn’t leave this universe.

There were too many people relying on him. Moreover, Zhuang Weiran would definitely not agree to leave. It was the same for Snowy. She was the master of the Sprite Palace now, so she would definitely not abandon those Sprite Kings who’d chosen to follow her.

Yang Ye remained silent for a moment, and then he shook his head, “I can’t leave.”

Blood Maiden frowned slightly, “You intend to fight the Nether Pavilion?”

Yang Ye laughed bitterly, “You think too highly of me.”

He didn’t know how great the Nether Pavilion’s overall strength was, but he knew that they didn’t even have to use their full strength. Just the ten Nether Halls or a Nether Envoy weren’t existences that he could resist.

It couldn’t be helped. They were born much earlier.

Blood Maiden spoke softly, “Your natural talent is amazing, truly amazing. However, you’re too young. You need to grow before you can make my Nether Pavilion take you seriously. Listen to your second sister and leave with your forces. Don’t participate in this battle.”

Yang Ye asked, “The Nether Pavilion won’t slaughter the people of this universe, right?”

“Fool!” Meanwhile, Little Sky suddenly said, “Even though they won’t slaughter them, they will enslave the people of this world. All the powers of this world will have to obey them. If they refuse, you know what’ll happen. At that time, the fate of every being in this world will be in the hands of the Nether Pavilion.”

Little Sky’s eyes and brows drooped down as she continued, “The Lord of the Heaven Dao doesn’t interfere in the battles between the races of this universe. So, the Lord of the Heaven Dao is the fairest and most impartial. However, if the Nether Pavilion replaces the Lord of the Heaven Dao, the laws and order of this world will be rewritten. No one is willing to be enslaved!”

Blood Maiden suddenly said, “The people of this world and the Lord of the Heaven Dao can’t stop the Nether Pavilion!” CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“We have to even if we can’t!” Little Sky gazed at Blood Maiden, “Merak System won’t submit.”

Blood Maiden glanced at Little Sky, and then she gazed at Yang Ye, “Leave as soon as possible!” Her figure shook and transformed into a ray of blood red light that vanished into the sky.

Little Sky fell silent for a moment before turning around and leaving. Yang Ye was stunned for a moment, and then he followed after her.

All along the way, Little Sky remained silent. Yang Ye glanced at her but didn’t speak, and he just followed her.

Around two hours later, Yang Ye followed Little Sky to an unknown mountain, and she stopped before the huge and towering mountain. The mountain had an extremely strange shape. If one looked down at it from above, one would notice that it looked like a sleeping beast.

Little Sky stood not too far afar from it while Yang Ye stood at her side.

Little Sky gazed at it for a long time before she shrugged, “Big fellow, people are coming to bully us. You know I don’t like to fight, so I sealed my ability to do that. But I’m such a fool. I can’t remember how to unseal myself. I’m such a big fool.”

Yang Ye felt speechless.

Meanwhile, Little Sky continued, “Even though I don’t like to fight and hate war, it can’t be helped this time. You have to help me when the time comes.”

Yang Ye gazed at the mountain. The mountain was deathly silent and didn’t react at all.

However, Little Sky beamed, “Then it’s decided. I’ll call you when it’s time to fight! Sleep for now!”

As soon as she finished speaking, she turned around and walked away.

Yang Ye glanced at the huge mountain, and then he hurriedly followed after her.

Yang Ye asked as they traveled, “What’s in the mountain?”

Little Sky replied, “A big fellow. He was born on the same day as me. He’s really strong.”

Yang Ye glanced at her, “How strong?”

Little Sky blinked and replied, “I don’t know. Because I’ve never seen him fight. In any case, he’s very strong.”

Yang Ye didn’t know what to say.

Meanwhile, she sped up, and it didn’t take long for them to arrive beneath the ground. Around six hours later, they arrived at a world of lava. Once they entered the lava, they continued for another six hours before they finally stopped.

There was a ball of blazing flames not too far away from them, and Yang Ye could faintly see something jumping around within the ball of flames.

Little Sky shrugged, “Little Flame, people are coming to bully us.”

Yang Ye felt speechless when he heard this.

Little Sky continued, “It may not be avoidable this time, and I may need your help when the time comes. So, stop sleeping for now. Otherwise, it’ll be quite embarrassing if you don’t come when I ask you to help.”

Yang Ye gazed at the ball of flames, but it didn’t give any reply.

Meanwhile, Little Sky suddenly nodded, “Relax, when has our Merak System ever feared anyone? It’s decided. Stop sleeping for now, alright? I’ll call for you when the time comes!”

As soon as she finished speaking, she turned around and left.

Yang Ye glanced at the ball of flames, and then he hurried after Little Sky.

This time, Yang Ye followed Little Sky high up into the sky. After waiting for a short while, a huge eye appeared above them.

Little Sky spoke indifferently, “Tell those fellows down below to be prepared at all times. We have a battle to fight!”

The Eye of the Heaven Dao shook slightly and vanished.

Once it vanished, Little Sky vanished as well, and Yang Ye hurried after her again.

A day later, Yang Ye and Little Sky stopped.

There was a mountain cemetery in front of them. Tombstones filled the mountain, and even Yang Ye couldn’t see the end of them.

After they arrived here, Yang Ye had an extremely solemn expression on his face. He felt like chills were constantly running down his spine. Moreover, he instinctively felt that this place was dangerous!

Very dangerous!

Little Sky continued forward. Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and followed her.

It didn’t take long for them to stop. Yang Ye saw a little girl amidst the tombstones. She seemed to be around the age of 16 or 17, just like Little Sky. She wore a white dress and held a bone in her grasp. There were numerous squares made with bones beneath her feet.

At this moment, she was jumping happily within those squares.

She only had a single leg!

Little Sky waved at her, “Hey, Qin.”

The little girl turned to look at Yang Ye and Little Sky. She smiled when she noticed Little Sky, and then she jumped over to Little Sky and grinned, “Little Sky, long time no see.”

Little Sky grinned and said, “This is my new friend, Yang Ye!”

The little girl immediately turned to look at Yang Ye when she heard Little Sky. Suddenly, Little Sky’s expression changed, “Don’t look!”

Bang!

As soon as Little Sky finished speaking, Yang Ye appeared 3km away.

Once his figure stopped there, a wisp of scarlet red instantly seeped out from the corner of his mouth.
