Chapter 2213 – The Tomb of Gods!

Step! Step!

The footsteps resounded from deep within the city again.

They were very slow, like their owner was just taking a stroll, but every single step made the sounds throughout the world vanish without a trace.

Only the footsteps remained in the world!

Meanwhile, Yang Wudi lightly slapped his right palm against the wall.

Hiss!

His figure escaped the wooden spear. At the same time, Yang Ye appeared in front of him.

Yang Wudi glanced at the hold in his chest, shook his head, and smiled, “Interesting indeed. Looks like I underestimated the undying race!”

He gazed at Yang Ye, “You leave first!”

Yang Ye shook his head.

Yang Wudi said, “Hear those footsteps? It can cover the sound of all things until only it remains. Such ability and strength is something that even I dare not guarantee that I can stop, even at my prime.”

As he spoke, he patted Yang Ye lightly on the shoulder, “Don’t be impulsive. Because it’s pointless. So leave!”

Yang Ye shook his head, “I can’t do that!”

Yang Wudi smiled, “Who will avenge me if you die here? The men of my Yang Clan repay both kindness and enmity. So, you naturally have to avenge me. Leave, alright?”

Yang Ye was about to speak when Yang Wudi formed a strange seal, and then a blue circle of light appeared below Yang Ye’s feet. After that, it shook violently before Yang Ye’s figure started to gradually turn ethereal.

Yang Ye instinctively tried to struggle free of the teleportation formation, but Yang Wudi’s voice suddenly resounded in his mind, “Are you trying to make me die with everlasting regret?”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Wudi started walking slowly toward the distance, and he stopped after walking around 10km away.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye’s figure had turned completely ethereal. However, he witnessed a scene before he vanished completely—A wooden spear stabbed into Yang Wudi’s chest.

At the same time, Yang Wudi shot a glance backward, and it was exactly where Yang Ye was. A smile appeared on his face when he saw that Yang Ye had vanished completely.

He fell!

This time, Yang Wudi had truly fallen.

Dugu Juetian walked over to Yang Wudi, she gazed at the wooden spear in his chest, and then she fell silent for a moment before looking toward the distance and falling to one knee, “Lord Xiao Lou!”

A voice came from afar, “Imprison him in the Tomb of Gods.”

Dugu Juetian hesitated for a moment and said, “Isn’t it only for the living? He…”

“Such experts don’t die that easily! Even though he sought death, if he wants to live, then besides a few in this world, who can truly annihilate him?” The voice replied softly, “If he’s willing to work for our undying race, we can return him his freedom and strength. Otherwise, he can stay trapped in the endless darkness of the Tomb of Gods forever!”

Dugu Juetian spoke softly, “But does he have the right to be imprisoned there?”

The voice replied indifferently, “You couldn’t even fight back against a clone of his. Is that not enough?”

Dugu Juetian lowered her head slightly and fell silent.

“Don’t be dissatisfied!” The voice continued, “Perhaps his main body is inferior to the Void Spirit Maiden of all those years ago, but it wouldn’t be much weaker. The Tomb of Gods is a way our undying race shows respect to the top expert throughout the universe, and he has the right to be placed in there. Do it!”

Dugu Juetian nodded, “Which tomb?”

The voice replied, “The tenth!”

Tenth!

Dugu Juetian’s expression changed, and she was quite shocked.

The Tomb of the Gods wasn’t just a tomb the undying race had built, it was a place to imprison the top experts who had once lost to the undying race. The undying race had launched expeditions into countless universes and conquered them, but up until now, only around 20 experts had the right to be imprisoned in the Tomb of Gods. However, besides the third tomb, all the top ten tombs had always been empty. Because besides that expert in the third tomb, the undying race felt that until now, no other expert had the right to be placed within the top ten tombs!

However, Dugu Juetian hadn’t expected Lord Xiao Lou to think so highly of the man before her and imprison him in the tenth tomb!

The voice asked, “You think he has no right?”

Dugu Juetian nodded, “While he’s extremely strong, the Immortal Executioner in the 12th tomb, and the Night Demon Emperor in the 11th tomb aren’t any weaker to him, right? Not to mention them, even Fan Tianyin in the 13th tomb is stronger than him, right?”

“Girl!” Meanwhile, the voice resounded, “You’re too young. I can sense how strong he is, but you can’t. That’s because you’re not strong enough. Understand?”

Dugu Juetian’s face froze. She didn’t say another word and just vanished on the spot with Yang Wudi’s body.

The area fell silent once more.

…

The large universe. At the door of light in the endless black holes.

The door of light suddenly trembled, and then a man walked out slowly from within.

It was Yang Ye!

Yang Ye immediately turned around and gazed at the door of light once he emerged from it. He was about to enter it when An Nanjing appeared before him. She grabbed his hand and shook her head.

Yang Ye clenched his fists and fell silent.

A long time passed before Yang Ye took a deep and long glance at the door, and then he left with An Nanjing.

Void Spirit Continent.

After he returned to Void Spirit Continent with her, he immediately entered the Primordial Pagoda.

In the Primordial Pagoda, Yang Ye issued a command in his heart, and Scarlet appeared before him. The black and red pigtails behind her head were extremely striking.

Yang Ye was about to speak when Snowy suddenly appeared in front of Scarlet. Scarlet’s eyes lit up when she saw Snowy, and then she opened her mouth and tried to bite Snowy.

Snowy’s eyes instantly opened wide, and then she slapped her claw at Scarlet.

Bang!

Scarlet was slapped flying.

Yang Ye was stunned speechless by this.

Meanwhile, Scarlet was furious. The naivety and immaturity on her face had vanished, and only ferocity and the desire to kill remained. She raised her hand, and a blood red sword appeared in her grasp. After that, she swung the sword at Snowy.

Snowy gazed at Yang Ye. She was asking him why this little fellow was so arrogant.

Yang Ye shrugged to display that he didn’t know.

Meanwhile, her sword had arrived before Snowy.

Yang Ye raised his palm and slapped it forward!

However, his expression changed when it touched the blood red sword.

Bang!

An explosion resounded, and Yang Ye was blasted over 3km away!

Moreover, there was an extremely deep injury on his palm!

Yang Ye was shocked, Scarlet is so strong?

Snowy was furious when she saw Yang Ye being pushed back. She was no weakling, so she immediately opened her mouth and took a breath. In an instant, the blood red sword in Scarlet’s grasp turned into a ray of red light that entered Snowy’s mouth. At the same time, the slaughter intent she emanated was completely absorbed.

Scarlet was stunned.

Yang Ye was quite stunned too. Snowy is that strong now? She can even absorb slaughter intent?

Scarlet blinked and used her eyes to shoot a plea for help to Yang Ye.

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

Meanwhile, Snowy flew over to Scarlet, and then she grabbed Scarlet’s pigtails and started swinging her about.

Scarlet was infuriated once more. She howled with fury while endless slaughter intent surged out from her. In an instant, the entire sky within the Primordial Pagoda was filled with slaughter intent and had turned blood red!

However, Snowy wasn’t affected at all, and she just continued slamming Scarlet about with her pigtails.

A Sprite!

Scarlet may be extremely strong, but she was still a Sprite, and Sprites would be countered by Snowy. However, because Scarlet was too strong, her first thought hadn’t been fear, it had been the intent to devour Snowy.

Unfortunately, Snowy had evolved. Even though she wasn’t that great at combat, she was extremely powerful when it came to dealing with Sprites!

Suddenly, Scarlet raised her hands.

Surrender!

The little fellow was finally unable to take it and had chosen to surrender!

Snowy stopped, and Scarlet immediately flew over to Yang Ye before gazing at him with a wronged expression on her face. Moreover, she kept pointing at Snowy.

Snowy blinked and felt that this entire thing was quite strange. I’ve become the bad one?

Yang Ye shook his head and chuckled. He rubbed Scarlet’s head and said, “Don’t bully Snowy. Listen to Snowy, understand?”

Scarlet bit her finger and glanced at Snowy. Snowy waved her claw, and then Scarlet hurriedly nodded!

Yang Ye smiled. He seemed to have thought of something at this point and summoned the Sword Spirit. As soon as she saw the Sword Spirit, Scarlet’s eyes lit up again. She grabbed the Sword Spirit and gazed at Snowy. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

At this moment, Yang Ye was shocked to notice that the aura she emanated had become many times stronger!

Danger!

At this moment, Snowy sensed strong danger too!

Snowy wasn’t the only one, Yang Ye sensed danger too!

It was a feeling of danger which he only got from progenitors. Yet now, he was sensing it from Scarlet.

Scarlet started walking slowly in Snowy’s direction. The Sword Spirit emanated endless slaughter intent in Scarlet’s hands. In just a short while, the entire pagoda was filled by slaughter intent!

It was even more terrifying than Yang Ye’s slaughter intent!

Swords were weapons of slaughter, and Yang Ye’s sword was a true sword of slaughter!

So, its might was boundlessly enhanced in Scarlet’s grasp. Once she had the Sword Spirit in her grasp, her slaughter intent had a container, so it grew even more terrifying!

Snowy blinked, gulped, and then glanced at Yang Ye. Meanwhile, Scarlet had arrived near Snowy. Scarlet gazed at Snowy while the Sword Spirit trembled incessantly, and she shot a threatening gaze at Snowy.

Revenge!

The little fellow wanted revenge for the beating Snowy had given her!

Suddenly, Snowy looked up at the sky and waved her claws swiftly.

Boom!

A moment of silence ensued, and then a ray of golden light flashed through the sky before a small pagoda appeared in Snowy’s paw.

The Primordial Pagoda!

Snowy started walking slowly toward Scarlet with the Primordial Pagoda in her paw. She pointed her paw at Scarlet, and then clenched it.

A threat!

A direct threat!

Scarlet blinked, glanced at Snowy, and then glanced at the Primordial Pagoda. In the end, she glanced at the sword in her grasp, and she felt like she had no chance to win now.

So, she gazed at Yang Ye.

Yang Ye shrugged because he was unable to help!

Suddenly, she transformed into a ray of blood red light that entered Yang Ye’s forehead, and then Yang Ye’s eyes instantly opened wide.

Two rays of blood red light surged out from his eyes. At the same time, a strand of terrifying slaughter intent swept out.

Boom!

The space within the Primordial pagoda started to collapse!
