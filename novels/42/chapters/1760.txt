Chapter 1761 – I Want To Run!

The Ying Clan!

The Ying Clan’s main world was called Heaven Desolation Continent, and it was situated at the central area of the medium universe. Heaven Desolation Continent could be said to be the most bustling continent in the medium universe, and it was the largest amongst the continents in the medium universe too!

Heaven Desolation City.

It was the largest city on the Heaven Desolation Continent, and it was the Ying Clan’s headquarters.

Early in the morning.

Something very unusual occurred in the peaceful streets of Heaven Desolation City. Two True Realm experts of the Ying Clan had gone missing.

Their disappearance was very strange, and when the Ying Clan started to search for them, even more True Realm experts vanished.

At noon, seven True Realm experts of the Ying Clan were missing!

At this moment, the Ying Clan knew that something was off.

Heaven Desolation Hall.

All the core figures of the Ying Clan were gathered here, and the leader of the meeting was the Ying Clan’s patriarch, Ying Qing!

Ying Qing said, “Have you found them?”

A black robed old man shook his head.

Ying Qing’s eyes narrowed slightly, “Someone is acting against our Ying Clan!”

The faces of everyone here turned gloomy.

Someone was acting against their clan!

Who dared to do so?

The Ying Clan’s strength was clearly the strongest in the medium universe. Of course, the comparatively mysterious Ku Clan had to be excluded. But even the Ku Clan wouldn’t dare to rashly attack the Ying Clan.

As for the other clans, they were even more fearful of the Ying Clan.

Suddenly, the black robed old man said, “Could it be the Yang Clan?”

The Yang Clan!

The only existing conflict they had was between them and the Yang Clan. Based on Yang Ye and Yang Lianshuang’s character, it was very likely for them to do something like this. Especially Yang Ye. That fellow was someone who feared absolutely nothing!

A long moment of silence filled the hall, and then Ying Qing said, “Tell all our True Realm experts to return to Heaven Desolation Hall! Besides that, activate the Heaven Desolation Formation and seal off the entire continent.”

Once Ying Qing gave the orders, all the True Realm experts of the Ying Clan retreated to Heaven Desolation Hall. At the same time, the entire continent was covered in a faint yellow barrier of light.

Heaven Desolation City.

At a remote corner of the city, Yang Lianshuang gazed at Yang Ye, “They’ve converged their forces, so it’s difficult to attack them now.”

Yang Ye replied, “Since we can’t kill them, let’s start a fire instead!”

Yang Lianshuang was puzzled, “A fire? How?”

A smile curled up on the corners of Yang Ye’s lips, “Come with me!”

As he spoke, he transformed into a ray of light that shot beneath the ground. Yang Lianshuang didn’t hesitate to follow him.

They were extremely swift, and it didn’t take long for them to arrive at the center of the continent, a world of lava!

Yang Lianshuang glanced at the lava around them and gazed at Yang Ye, “What are you planning?”

Yang Ye smiled, “What do you think?”

She spoke solemnly, “You intend to make all of it erupt up to the surface!”

Yang Ye nodded.

She shook her head slightly, “It won’t be much of a threat to those True Realm experts of the Ying Clan!”

Not to mention an eruption of lava, even bathing in lava wasn’t a problem for True Realm experts!

Yang Ye replied, “What would the Ying Clan do if the core of the continent was damaged, and lava erupted from beneath the ground?”

Yang Lianshuang’s eyes lit up, “They’ll send their forces to deal with it!”

Yang Ye nodded, “We can’t kill them while they’re gathered, but if they split apart, and we attack together, then no True Realm experts below the 6th stage would be able to stop us!”

Yang Lianshuang suddenly asked, “What if a 6th stage True Realm expert of the Ying Clan comes for us?”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and said, “What do we have to fear? We’ve killed one before!”

She gave him a thumbs up, “You’re a true man!”

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings and said, “Let’s get to work!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he held tightly onto the wooden sword in his hand, and then his profound energy surged madly into it.

Om!

A moment later, an ear piercing sword howl suddenly resounded, and then a ray of light shot up into the sky from underground. It was extremely fast, and it took just a few moments to shoot out of the ground and shoot into the clouds.

Along with the arrival of that sword energy, a huge gap cracked open in the ground, and then an endless stream of lava seeped out from the crack.

Just ten breaths of time later, another ray of light emerged over 10,000km away from the first one.

Just like that, numerous large cracks appeared in the ground, and countless streams of lava surged out from the ground.

At this moment, everyone in Heaven Desolation Hall was shocked!

In Heaven Desolation Hall.

All the experts of the Ying Clan had unsightly expressions on their faces. Obviously, they hadn’t expected Yang Ye to do this.

“He's forcing us to leave this hall!” The black robed old man spoke solemnly, “If we leave to clean up the lava, then we’ll be doing exactly as he wants. Because very few of us are able to defend ourselves against his attacks. But if we don’t head out there, then even if the lava doesn’t destroy our continent, it’ll damage the foundation of our continent. Moreover, if we don’t stop him, then that fellow may do something worse!”

To go out or not!

It was the dilemma that all the experts of the Ying Clan faced right now!

This time, they noticed that Yang Ye was absolutely difficult to deal with. Previously, even though Yang Ye’s strength truly shocked them, they felt that no matter how strong he was, he wouldn’t be able to fight their clan.

Because it was impossible for Yang Ye to fight over a dozen experts on his own, right?

But now, they noticed that if Yang Ye didn’t choose to fight them head-on and acted shamelessly, then they were completely helpless against him.

Yang Ye wasn’t terrifying, but the shameless version of Yang Ye was absolutely terrifying!

A short moment of silence filled the hall, and then Ying Qing said, “Ten people in a group. Head out there and seal up the cracks. Don’t get locked in battle if you encounter him. You just have to defend yourselves and notify the others.”

“That won’t solve our main problem!” The black robed old man spoke solemnly, “Because we can’t seal up the cracks in time.”

Ying Qing nodded, “I know. Just do it and leave the rest to me!”

The black robed old man glanced at Ying Qing and nodded, and then he turned around and vanished on the spot with the other experts of the Ying Clan.

A certain corner of Heaven Desolation City.

A smile curled up on the corners of Yang Ye’s lips as he gazed at those powerful auras that shot up into the air from within Heaven Desolation Hall.

“They’ve left!” Yang Lianshuang said, “But they’ve formed groups of ten. We can’t kill ten True Realm experts in a short while!”

Yang Ye smiled, “Why do we have to kill them?”

She turned to look at Yang Ye, “Then what do you intend to do?”

Yang Ye tapped the ground with his foot and said, “Tell me, would the entire medium universe be shocked if Heaven Desolation City was destroyed?”𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Yang Lianshuang gazed at Yang Ye for a long time before she replied, “I’m growing a little afraid of you!”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “What do you mean?”

She replied, “A strong person isn’t very terrifying, but someone strong who’s also shameless is terrifying. Not only shameless, but despicable too. There’s a saying from where I come from. Gangsters aren’t terrifying, but well-educated gangsters are horrifying. I think you’re a person like that!”

Yang Ye’s face was utterly dark, “I didn’t realize that you were so good at insulting people!”

She grinned, “Let’s stop wasting time. Tell me, what do you plan to do?”

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings, “Come with me!”

Both of them vanished on the spot.

Three breaths of time later.

Om!

A sword howl resounded through the air above Heaven Desolation City, and then a ray of sword energy shot down from the sky and entered the city.

Boom!

A loud explosion reverberated through the city, and then the city was chopped into two. However, that wasn’t the end of it. Another ray of sword energy entered the city, and then the city was instantly chopped into four!

The entire city was filled with clamorous noise!

Someone was attacking the Ying Clan!

That was what appeared in all their minds.

But who would dare to do such a thing?

Yang Ye didn’t stop. Two more rays of sword energy entered the city. In an instant, the city was chopped into numerous pieces!

As for the experts of the Ying Clan that had left the city, they rushed back towards the city again. However, the people within the city were running away from the city.

So, Heaven Desolation City was in chaos.

At a corner outside the city, Yang Ye was looking at the ruins of the city walls, and no one knew what he was thinking.

Suddenly, Yang Lianshuang said, “We have to retreat!”

Yang Ye nodded, and then his sword moved again. In an instant, a few words appeared on the city wall — Rebuild it if you have the balls! I’ll be back tomorrow!

Once he finished leaving that message, a smile curled up on the corners of Yang Ye’s mouth, “Let’s go!”

He shot up into the sky with Yang Lianshuang.

It didn’t take long for them to arrive before the Heaven Desolation Formation. Yang Lianshuang gazed at the formation, and then she gazed at Yang Ye, “Will you, or shall I?”

Yang Ye replied, “It’s time for you to put on a show of strength!”

She nodded, and then her right hand suddenly transformed into a pitch black claw. After that, she slapped it against the formation.

Boom!

The entire formation shook violently, and then the barrier of light was torn open where her claw struck.

She pulled her hand away and gazed at Yang Ye, “Let’s go!”

Yang Ye nodded. He was about to speak when both their expressions changed. A moment of silence ensued, and then Yang Lianshuang spoke softly, “As I expected, running after making a show of strength doesn’t work.”

As soon as she finished speaking, a white haired old man and a middle aged man appeared not too far above them.

The middle aged man was the Ying Clan’s patriarch, Ying Qing. Of course, that wasn’t the main point. The main point was the white haired old man.

Because the white haired old man was a 6th stage True Realm expert!

Meanwhile, Yang Lianshuang gazed at Yang Ye, “Do you have a plan?”

Yang Ye nodded, “I do!”

Yang Lianshuang hurriedly asked, “What is it?”

Yang Ye replied, “I want to run!”

Yang Lianshuang was rendered speechless.
