Chapter 1568 - Let’s Talk!

Translator: InVader

Devil Crest Empire.

The devil race wasn’t united under one leadership as well. There were many powers in the Devil Territory, and Devil Crest Empire was one of them. Even though Devil Crest Empire could only be considered as an eight star power now, it was once the overlord of the Devil Territory many, many years ago. At that time, the entire Devil Territory was under Devil Crest Empire’s command, and it was the period when the devil race was the strongest.

Even though the devil race had split apart now, Devil Crest Empire’s strength still couldn’t be underestimated. There were only 5 eight star powers in the devil race, and Devil Crest Empire was one of them.

Mo Xiaoleng was being kept captive by the crown prince of the Devil Crest Empire, Ke Ni.

All along the way, Yang Ye didn’t stop for a moment and went straight for Devil Crest Empire.

He didn’t care about Mo Xiaoleng’s fate at all, and he was merely afraid that something would happen to Snowy’s consciousness.

It didn’t take long for Yang Ye to arrive at the capital of Devil Crest Empire, Devil Crest City.

Devil Darkness City could be called the largest city in the Devil Territory. It was built during Devil Crest Empire’s prime, and it was so well fortified that it could resist the attacks of at least 20 Rebirth Realm experts.

That was why it was able to survive until now.

Actually, the human race and devil race didn’t look very different to each other. The only difference was that the devil race had eyes that were violet or black in color, and their bodies were much more robust. Besides that, there weren’t any large differences between the humans and devils. So, it was very easy for Yang Ye to enter Devil Crest City.

Yang Ye would naturally not do something foolish like attacking the palace. He was here to save Snowy’s consciousness and not look for trouble with the devil race. So, once he entered the city, Yang Ye concealed himself with the Sword Domain and snuck into the palace.

Once he entered the imperial palace, Yang Ye stopped because he didn’t know Mo Xiaoleng’s exact location. He was clearly unable to search with his divine sense in this place because once he did, he would definitely be detected by the experts of the Devil Crest Empire.

Yang Ye remained silent on the spot for a moment, and then he snuck towards the area behind the palace.

All along the way, Yang Ye’s expression gradually grew solemn because he sensed numerous powerful auras. Obviously, it was the Rebirth Realm experts of Devil Crest Empire.

Yang Ye suddenly stopped by the side of a palace, and then he transformed into a shadow that entered it. If he just moved around at random, who knew when he would find Mo Xiaoleng? So, he’d decided to grab someone and ask.

Yang Ye frowned after he entered the palace because that palace was completely empty.

It’s empty? Yang Ye turned around with the intention of leaving, but the voice of a woman suddenly resounded, “You’re leaving already?”

Yang Ye frowned because there was someone here, and that person had noticed his presence!

Suddenly, the woman’s voice resounded once more, “You’re a human!”

Yang Ye walked out from the shadows. Meanwhile, a woman walked out from the inner chambers of the palace. She wore a bluish green palace dress, had crescent shaped brows, a gorgeous appearance, and practically perfectly exquisite features. It was especially so for her eyes, her eyes were actually ocean blue.

Besides that, her hair was ocean blue as well. Moreover, it was extremely long to the point of extending beyond her waist.

Yang Ye was sizing up the woman, and she was sizing up Yang Ye.

After scanning him for a moment, she grinned, “A human was actually able to sneak into this place. You’re not ordinary.”

“I have no intention to offend you!” Yang Ye continued, “I’m merely here to look for someone. Do you know where the crown prince of Devil Crest Empire is? I’ll be extremely thankful if you can tell me that.”

He’d intended to capture someone and ask, but he’d discarded that thought right now. Because he couldn’t see through her at all. Moreover, she’d noticed his presence before he showed himself, so it was obvious that she was no ordinary person.

“The crown prince of Devil Crest Empire?” She glanced at him and smiled, “Why are you looking for him?”

Yang Ye fell silent for a moment and said, “He had captured the princess of the Divine Phoenix Clan, and I’m here for her!”

“Interesting.” She smiled, “So, you’re here to rescue the woman you love. Your courage is commendable, and you’re quite a good person. Unfortunately, you’ll only be giving your life away.”

Yang Ye spoke indifferently, “Do you know where he is? Or perhaps where Mo Xiaoleng is? If you do know, then please let me know, and I’ll be absolutely thankful; if you don’t know, then please be frank.”

“I know where he is!” She smiled, “I don’t just know where Ke Ni is, I know where the Divine Phoenix Clan’s princess is being kept. But why should I tell you?”

Yang Ye gazed at her for a long time, and then he said, “Farewell!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye turned around and walked away. He had no interest in wasting his breath here. Since she wasn’t willing to tell him, then he intended to look for someone else. Ke Ni was the crown prince of Devil Crest Empire, so there should be many who knew where he was.

“He’s in Rising Wind Palace!” Suddenly, the woman said, “It’s Ke Ni’s palace, and it’s at the south of the imperial palace. Mo Xiaoleng should be being held there.”

Yang Ye turned to look at her, “Thank you.”

She grinned, “Good luck.”

Yang Ye glanced at her, and then he turned around and vanished.

Once Yang Ye left, she shook her head, smiled, and entered the inner chambers.

After he left that palace, Yang Ye glanced at the plaque outside the palace, and he saw two words there — Guest Hall.

She isn’t from the devil race? Yang Ye thought deeply for a moment, and then he turned around and vanished on the spot.

It didn’t take long for Yang Ye to arrive at the south of the imperial palace, and then he found Rising Wind Palace which the woman told him about. As soon as he snuck into the palace, Yang Ye immediately clenched his fists.

Because he sensed the aura of flames!

Yang Ye traveled towards the source of the flames, and it didn’t take long for him to see Mo Xiaoleng in the inner chambers of Rising Wind Palace. At this moment, she was trapped within a translucent cage, and there were black threads of light around her. Those threads of light overlapped in layers around her cage.

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings, and he showed himself once he noticed that there were no other auras and divine senses in the surroundings.

Meanwhile, Mo Xiaoleng opened her eyes. Her expression instantly changed when she saw Yang Ye, “It’s you!”

Yang Ye spoke with an indifferent expression on his face, “Snowy’s consciousness!”

Mo Xiaoleng spoke in a low voice, “I don’t have it.”

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly, “What do you mean?”

She replied, “Ke Ni took it. He’s using Snowy’s consciousness to make me marry him. Snowy is safe for now.”

Yang Ye took a deep breath and said, “Does he know about Snowy’s identity?”

Mo Xiaoleng shook her head, “Snowy doesn’t have her body, so he definitely isn’t aware of her identity. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have used Snowy to threaten me.”

Meanwhile, Yang Ye walked slowly in Mo Xiaoleng’s direction. He gazed at her for a long time, and then he suddenly started laughing, “Mo Xiaoleng, do you know that your Divine Phoenix Clan only has a few thousand phoenixes left because of you? I really want to know how you feel right now.”

Mo Xiaoleng stared at him in silence.

Yang Ye chuckled, “Actually, I really want to kill you. However, I’ve decided against that. Because I would be letting you escape too easily. I want you to live a lifetime of guilt!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye drew his sword and swung it twice.

Hiss! Hiss!

Mo Xiaoleng’s arms instantly flew away while accompanied by torrents of blood.

Once he chopped off her arms, he turned around and walked away.

Meanwhile, Mo Xiaoleng suddenly said, “Yang Ye!”

Yang Ye stopped and said, “What?”

She stared at his back, “You should have just taken revenge on me! Why did you take revenge on my clan?!”

Actually, in the beginning, she was against the way that the Divine Phoenix Clan intended to treat Snowy. Unfortunately, she had no right to make decisions. In the end, she saved Snowy’s consciousness. Besides the fact that she likes Snowy, the other reason she saved Snowy’s consciousness was because she wanted to leave a way out for the Divine Phoenix Clan. Because she was very well aware of how terrifying Yang Ye’s potential and strength were. Yang Ye could pose a threat to the Divine Phoenix Clan, and that was why she had been ceaselessly getting people to go kill Yang Ye.

Unfortunately, Yang Ye was still alive and killed his way up to the large world, so it was the Divine Phoenix Clan that suffered miserable.

“Take revenge on your clan? Hahaha!” Yang Ye turned to look at her. At this moment, he had a ferocious expression on his face, “Mo Xiaoleng, hear me well. It’ll be fine if Snowy and Zi’er are safe and well, but if anything happens to any one of them, then trust me, I’ll definitely make your Divine Phoenix Clan go extinct. So, pray! Pray for Snowy and Zi’er!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye turned around and vanished on the spot.

Mo Xiaoleng stared fixedly at the spot Yang Ye vanished towards. A long time passed before two streams of tears flowed down from her eyes. She’d been acting willfully all her life, and the Divine Phoenix Clan was always there to support and protect her. So, she’d always been willful. Because everyone had to give her face while she had the Divine Phoenix Clan’s support.

But this time, the Divine Phoenix Clan’s name was useless.

This time, she’d caused the Divine Phoenix Clan to be almost annihilated. Countless phoenixes from her clan were dead because of her willful behavior.

She, Mo Xiaoleng, deserved to be called a sinner of the Divine Phoenix Clan.

…

After he left the palace, Yang Ye went straight for the largest palace here. This time, he didn’t conceal his aura.

It wasn’t necessary anymore.

He didn’t want to waste more time here, nor did he want to take unnecessary troubles to accomplish his objective.

When Yang Ye was 300m away from the largest palace, numerous powerful auras descended upon him. Obviously, they’d discovered his presence.

“Who dares to trespass into my Devil Crest Empire?!” A furious shout resounded from within the large palace, and then numerous auras shot towards Yang Ye.

Yang Ye took a deep breath, and then he waved his right hand. The Stellar Sword Diagram instantly appeared in front of him, and then the entire area seemed like it was in space.

At this moment, everyone in the empire was shocked.

What’s going on?

That was what all of them wondered right now.

At the same time, countless auras shot up into the sky from deep within the imperial palace, and they shot towards Yang Ye.

Yang Ye waved his right hand, and the Sword Precursor shot towards the distance. After that, countless strands of stellar sword energy started to tremble far away in the starry sky.

Yang Ye just had to give the command, and the stellar sword energy would appear.

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings and said, “Crown Prince of the Devil Crest Empire, Ke Ni, come here. Let’s have a chat.”

Everyone that heard this felt speechless.
