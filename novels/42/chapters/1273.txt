Chapter 1274 – I Think You’re Asking For A Beating!

Suddenly, the mysterious woman’s voice resounded, “He’s trying to buy time again!”

The middle aged man and old man exchanged glances upon hearing her, and then the old man stretched out his right hand with his palm facing upwards. In an instant, the sky above Yang Ye started transforming before a huge palm appeared out of nowhere. As soon as it appeared, the old man’s right hand was immediately pressed towards the ground.

The huge palm immediately slammed down at Yang Ye as well, and the powerful aura it carried caused a mountain below to collapse in an instant.

The middle aged man didn’t stand by idly. He’d knocked an arrow at the same time that the old man had attacked, and at the exact same time that the palm descended, a dark golden arrow shot forward like a bolt of lightning.

It tore through the air and space before it. It hadn’t even arrived before Yang Ye, yet the aura it carried pushed Yang Ye 2 steps back.

Yang Ye’s expression remained unchanged. He sheathed his sword into the ancient sheath and immediately drew it in one fluid motion.

A sword howl resounded as a ray of sword energy shot into the air towards the huge palm.

Meanwhile, the dark golden arrow had arrived in front of Yang Ye. But it didn’t take long for the Phantom Shield to appear in front of it. The Phantom Shield shook upon being struck by the arrow, and Yang Ye was pushed another 2 steps back by the aftershock. As for the dark golden arrow, it was bounced away by the Phantom Shield!

Bang!

The sword energy collided with the huge palm in midair, and then both shattered. In an instant, a deafening explosion resounded, and the sky rippled!

The old man and middle aged man had solemn expressions on their faces. Because an expert’s skill was obvious once battle began. Yang Ye had dealt with their attacks with such ease, and it was sufficient to prove Yang Ye’s strength.

They knew Yang Ye liked to buy time, so they didn’t waste their breaths.

The old man was the first to attack. He stretched out his right hand while clenching tightly into a fist. A terrifying aura instantly seeped out from within him, yet it didn’t sweep towards Yang Ye. It immediately condensed into a huge and practically translucent fist, and it instantly enveloped the old man.

“Assault!” As soon as the ole man finished speaking, his figure shot forward. His target was Yang Ye, of course.

His fist hadn’t even arrived before Yang Ye, yet he felt like a few dozen mountains were pressing down upon him. Even if he had Rebirth Rank sword intent to protect himself, he still felt slightly suffocated.

Yang Ye didn’t dare to underestimate his opponents. After all, would anyone capable of attaining the Voider Realm be a weakling?

As soon as the old man attacked, the middle aged man had knocked an arrow, and an arrow that left a very long golden trail behind arrived in front of Yang Ye. It was naturally aimed at the center of Yang Ye’s forehead. Based on the aura it possessed, it seemed to be shot with the intention of blasting a hole open in Yang Ye’s skull. However, Yang Ye paid no attention to the arrow because the Phantom Shield had moved there to defend him.

So, Yang Ye’s gaze descended onto the old man. A cold glow flickered in his eyes as he sheathed his sword and drew it, and then a ray of sword energy tore through the air.

Space was instantly torn apart before it!

300 overlapped Heavenrend! 300 overlapped Heavenrends was the limit that his current body could endure, and it would suffer severe injuries if he tried to overlap even more.

Clang!

Bang!

The Phantom Shield shook violently while Yang Ye was blasted backwards. However, his figure hadn’t even stopped when a terrifying wave of energy swept over from afar. Fortunately, the Phantom Shield blocked off the wave of energy, but he was still shaken by it to the point of trembling violently.

After moving around 10m back, Yang Ye tapped his right foot down and stopped himself in midair. He looked up and saw that both the middle aged man and old man had been blasted over 30m back.

Suddenly, the woman’s voice resounded, “Don’t give him time to breathe!”

Her voice sounded like it came from all directions, and it was slightly ethereal, causing others to be unable to discover her true location.

The middle aged man and old man exchanged glances upon hearing her, and then the old man pushed his hands forward before overlapping them. In an instant, the space in the sky started to warp. It didn’t take long for 2 huge palms to appear above Yang Ye. The palms immediately overlapped upon appearing there, and then they slammed down at Yang Ye.

The middle aged man had immediately attacked when the old man did. An arrow tore through space and appeared in front of Yang Ye.

Regardless of whether it was the old man or the middle aged man, they hadn’t used their full strength. Because their objective was to keep Yang Ye busy and exhaust him. Because they were very well aware that Yang Ye hadn’t used his full strength as well. However, this was exactly what they wanted. Because since Yang Ye could kill those 2 Voiders from before, he definitely had a chance to kill them as well!

But if Yang Ye didn’t fight desperately, then Yang Ye would definitely die once the reinforcements from the Veiled Region arrived!

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly. This time, he didn’t sheath his sword but pressed it against the center of his forehead instead. A moment of silence ensued before the Phantom Shield in front of him shook slightly and moved forward to defend him against the attacks. This time, the Phantom Shield didn’t go towards the arrow but the old man’s overlapped palm attack. Because Yang Ye paid no attention to the arrow, so it instantly pierced his chest. At the instant his chest was pierced by the arrow, Yang Ye transformed into a ray of light that vanished on the spot, and he was around 30m to the left when his figure appeared once more.

At the moment Yang Ye vanished, a mysterious force had suddenly enveloped the surroundings.

“You....” The mysterious woman’s astounded voice suddenly resounded.

Hiss!

A strand of blood suddenly sprayed out from the space in front of Yang Ye. Yang Ye’s eyes were filled with ferocity. He didn’t waste his breath and just used his hand to grab at the space before him, and he’d pulled out a figure from within. After that, he immediately waved his sword lightly before transforming into a ray of light and entered the space before him while holding that figure in his grasp!

“Where do you think you’re going?!” As soon as the old man spoke, a palm had slapped at the expanse of space which Yang Ye had vanished into, causing it to instantly collapse. But Yang Ye was gone!

The middle aged man and old man intended to pursue Yang Ye, but they couldn’t sense Yang Ye’s aura anymore.

Both of their faces became extremely unsightly.

At this moment, how could they have possibly not realized that the reason Yang Ye had refused to flee and even fought them, hadn’t been to kill them. It was the mysterious woman instead!

The mysterious woman had been Yang Ye’s target! Everything that occurred earlier had just been done to trick them and make the mysterious woman lower her guard. Moreover, the reason Yang Ye hadn’t defended himself against that last arrow was also to lower the woman’s guard further! Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

He’d succeeded!

The mysterious woman was already heavily injured. Coupled with the fact that Yang Ye had launched a surprise attack, she’d naturally been captured with ease.

She hadn’t been careless, and it was merely because she’d really never expected Yang Ye to pinpoint her location with such accuracy. Not to mention a Quasi Emperor, even a true Voider couldn’t detect her location once she fully concealed herself. She’d never been discovered, so she was extremely confident in her ability in concealment.

That confidence made her take no precautions against Yang Ye. Not only had she taken no precautions, she’d even been watching from the shadows and waiting to give Yang Ye a lethal strike!

However, she hadn’t struck that lethal strike, but Yang Ye had struck one against her instead.

The middle aged man and old man had extremely unsightly expressions on their faces. Who the fuck said that Yang Ye is a rash and boorish fellow? He’s a fucking genius!

Yang Ye had captured the mysterious woman, and that meant that they couldn’t chase Yang Ye anymore. If they couldn’t chase Yang Ye, then Yang Ye would definitely refine puppets and recover. Once Yang Ye recovered to his peak and refined a Voider Realm puppet, killing him would really become difficult!

“That kid possesses monstrous strength, courage, boldness, and is very meticulous. He isn’t rash and boorish like the rumors say!” The middle aged man spoke in a low voice, “They say he’s very vengeful and frequently speaks about pulling out weeds by the roots so that no potential troubles are left. Based on his character, if he’s allowed to live and grow, then he’ll be a nightmare for us. No, he’s already capable of posing a threat to us.”

The old man’s eyes narrowed slightly, “He absolutely can’t be allowed to live!”

Yang Ye was just a Quasi Emperor now, yet he possessed such terrifying strength. So what if he attained the Emperor Realm? After all, when compared to the Quasi Emperor Realm, the Emperor Realm was like a divide. Once one attained the Emperor Realm, it represented transcending the world and gaining an immense increase in strength. This increase was an increase in all aspects. So, once Yang Ye attained the Emperor Realm....

Actually, Yang Ye attaining the Emperor Realm wasn’t the most terrifying thing. The most terrifying thing was the thought of Yang Ye attaining the Voider Realm! Could anyone stop Yang Ye once he attained the Voider Realm? Could anyone on the entire continent stop him?

Not to mention the Voider Realm, even if Yang Ye just attained the Emperor Realm, there would probably be few throughout the entire continent who could stop him. After all, Jian Wuji had been unmatched throughout the continent once he attained the Emperor Realm all those years ago. Now, Yang Ye wasn’t even the slightest bit inferior to the Jian Wuji from all those years ago!

When they thought about Yang Ye attaining the Emperor Realm and Voider Realm, both the middle aged man and old man couldn’t help but shudder. It was too terrifying to the point they didn’t dare to continue on that line of thought!

After a moment of silence, the middle aged man asked, “What do we do now?”

“Wait!” The old man took a deep breath and continued, “Wait for Old Man Yuan and the expert from the Slayer Pavilion to arrive. Otherwise, he remains hidden while we are out in the open right now!”

The middle aged man nodded to display that he understood. Yang Ye was hiding while they were out in the open. If they tried to pursue him, then they would be the ones that were in a passive position. After all, Yang Ye had the right to decide whether he would attack them. That wouldn’t be a problem if they were facing an ordinary person, but the problem was that they were facing Yang Ye. They didn’t want to have Yang Ye watching them from the shadows before suddenly launching a lethal attack against them!

...

After he grabbed the mysterious woman, he’d rushed forward madly and executed Void Flash thrice in the span of a few breaths of time. After he confirmed that the old man and middle aged man hadn’t chased after him, he finally stopped.

Once he stopped, he gazed at the woman before him. At this moment, he was holding onto her throat. Yang Ye didn’t observe her appearance carefully, and he just spoke directly, “You’ll tell me everything I want to know, right?”

She stared fixedly at him, “What do you think?”

Yang Ye gazed at her and said, “I think you’re asking for a beating!”
