Chapter 2764 – Just Fight!

Kill!

Once Yang Ye gave the order, Jiang Wudi and the others charged at the giants!

Meanwhile, Erya slammed herself against the demon!

At this moment, the demon had recovered from its shock, and a ferocious expression instantly appeared on its face when it saw Erya slam herself at it. It refused to show weakness and did the same!

Normally, the strength of demons was decided by their main bodies.

Of course, there were exceptions.

Erya was a huge exception!

Bang!

A howl of pain resounded, and the demon beast was blasted away again.

Erya pressed forward and charged at it again.

At this moment, Erya’s eyes had gradually turned scarlet red.

At a time like this, Erya was the most dangerous, and the most terrifying. It could be said that ordinary people wouldn’t dare to approach her right now!

Her ferocity had been aroused!

The demon finally realized how powerful Erya was, and there was a trace of fear in its heart.

However, it didn’t flee, and it charged at her again!

In an instant, the sky above the city started shaking violently.

Suppression!

As soon as they fought, Yang Ye’s side instantly suppressed Jiang Jun’s group. It was because Jiang Jun had lost the ability to fight!

Yang Ye’s gaze was locked on Jiang Jung. Right when Jiang Jun was about to retreat, Yang Ye suddenly vanished on the spot.

Jiang Jun was horrified when he noticed this. He was just about to summon the demon, but a shrill cry came from over there!

The demon beast’s shrill cry!

At this moment, Jiang Jun sensed the aura of death.

However, a giant suddenly slapped its palm at Yang Ye.

Yang Ye stopped for a moment and swung a backhand slash at it.

Hiss!

This slash sliced through the giant’s hand, and a moment later, a ray of light shot at Jiang Jun!

Always kill the leader first!

Meanwhile, the giant from before charged at Yang Ye again. This time, Yang Ye didn’t turn back, and the Sword Gourd on his waist trembled slightly. A moment later, a black sword shot out from it!

Burial!

The sword shot straight for the giant, and the giant swung its other hand at the sword.

The powerful force within the slap caused space to crack apart!

However, it was up against one of the sharpest swords in this universe!

Hiss!

Burial instantly slashed through the giant’s arm, and it didn’t slow down at all as it pierced through the giant’s forehead!

The giant’s powerful physical defenses were weak as paper before Burial!𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Meanwhile, Yang Ye had arrived before Jiang Jung. The latter was about to say something when Yang Ye swung his sword.

Bam!

Jiang Jun’s soul was instantly obliterated!

Yang Ye sheathed his sword. Meanwhile, Burial automatically returned to the Sword Gourd.

Yang Ye gazed at Erya. She waved at Yang Ye to say that she didn’t need any help.

She wanted to fight it in single combat!

Yang Ye didn’t interfere because while she was young, she had the heart of a strong expert. Or perhaps, the pride of an expert! While she wouldn’t say anything if he did help her, he hoped that she could defeat it herself. Moreover, he believed in her!

Not to mention that demon, even he wasn’t confident in being able to defeat Erya!

Yang Ye turned to look into the distance, and then he tapped his right foot down.

A sword howl resounded.

Along with a sword howl, the arm of a giant over 1km away was separated from its body. At the same time, a black sword pierced through its chest!

Bang!

The giant exploded into pieces.

Right when Yang Ye was about to launch another attack, a divine sense slammed down from afar!

Everyone here was shocked!

They sensed it, and the aura it emanated felt simply impossible to fight against!

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly. A moment later, he shot up into the starry sky, and it didn’t take long for the divine sense to arrive above him!

Yang Ye closed his eyes slowly, and he opened them a moment later. This time, his eyes were blood red!

The Demonic Sword Dao!

Moreover, the Sword Precursor in his grasp had turned blood red!

Yang Ye raised it above him with both hands, and then a moment of silence ensued before Yang Ye shouted with fury, “Slash!”

As soon as he said that, he swung his sword with both hands.

Hiss!

The space before him was sliced open like scissors cutting through cloth. However, the divine sense and its pressure weren’t affected at all.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye raised his sword again and swung it down.

Explosive Heavenrend combined with the Madness Sword Technique!

Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!

Along with a string of explosions, Yang Ye was pushed back repeatedly. He was pushed extremely far away. However, the pressure had been slashed apart as well.

But he hadn’t been able to gain even the slightest advantage against it!

Meanwhile, the giants fighting against Jian Wudi and the others retreated into outer space.

Yang Ye wiped off the blood on the corner of his mouth and looked up at the starry sky. Obviously, an extraordinary figure of the Four Dimensional Universe was behind that!

A moment of silence ensued, and then Yang Ye suddenly patted the Sword Gourd on his waist.

A sword howl resounded, and then a ray of light shot up into the sky and chased after the retreating giants.

Suddenly, a hexagonal energy shield appeared in outer space.

It appeared in Burial’s path!

Bang!

The sword struck the shield, causing it to shake and crack open slightly. But Burial was blasted back to Yang Ye!

Yang Ye grabbed Burial in his right hand.

Bam!

The force that came from the sword caused Yang Ye’s arm to crack open. At the same time, he was pushed almost 3km back!

Meanwhile, the hexagonal shield gradually vanished from there! As for the giants, they had vanished.

An Nanjing asked, “Should we give chase?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “The strength of that person just now is unfathomable. Chasing after them is meaningless.”

An Nanjing spoke solemnly, “Looks like the Four Dimensional Universe has started to take action.”

Yang Ye sheathed his sword and spoke softly, “Indeed they have!”

He gazed at Erya. Erya had killed the demon beast! However, she didn’t devour its energy.

Yang Ye was quite surprised. Has she become a vegetarian now?

Meanwhile, Erya patted the corpse and said, “Big Brother Yang, this fellow’s skin is thick. Snowy can use it to make some armor for the others. I’m sure it’ll be useful!”

Yang Ye’s eyes lip up and hurried over to her. He sized up the demon beast and touched it. Just as she’d said, its skin was really thick. While it couldn’t compete with Erya’s scales, it was still very precious!

Yang Ye nodded, “That’s a great idea!”

Erya grinned, and then she dragged the demon beast into the Primordial Pagoda.

However, Snowy didn’t dare to skin it. So, she made Oxxy and the others do the work. All of them would naturally not refuse. It was fine so long as they weren’t the ones being skinned!

Moreover, they could have a nice meal once they were done. Because Erya didn’t seem interested in it!

Besides the skin, the powers of Universe City started searching for precious natural treasures, like rare ores and anything else which could be used to forge armors and weapons. They found them all and moved them into the Primordial Pagoda.

So, Snowy’s Ascension Platform was covered in the precious materials from all the powers throughout the universe!

Snowy was overjoyed by this because she could finally forge as she pleased!

Of course, she hadn’t thought about how or what she would forge. In any case, she would just hammer them and knead them…

Outside the Primordial Pagoda. In Universe Hall.

Yang Ye gathered the others there. Besides Ding Shaoyao, everyone else here was at the Destiny Realm.

All of them had extremely solemn expressions on their faces, and the atmosphere here was quite heavy as well.

Yang Ye said, “You’ve seen what happened. What do you think?”

They remained silent.

Yang Ye smiled, “Do you have nothing to say?”

Yan Wu suddenly said, “Brother Yang, since we’re all on the same boat, and we have no way out, just tell us what we should do, then we’ll do it. As for surrendering or fleeing, none of us are idiots, so no one will do something as stupid as that!”

They nodded to display their agreement.

Meanwhile, an old man said, “At times like this, staying united is of the utmost importance. We have a chance to survive if we work together, but if we try to flee on our own…”

He shook his head slightly, “How can anyone survive when the home is lost?”

Actually, there was an even more important point. They were people who held real authority in this universe now. At a time like this, how could they possibly give up on this universe? Moreover, they were well-aware that even if they gave it up, the enemy may not spare them.

The weak didn’t have the right to live!

Yang Ye glanced at them and said, “Don’t be too pessimistic! The Four Dimensional Universe may be very strong, but we aren’t weak. Just as this senior here said, so long as we stay united, we still have a chance to win. Just like the previous battle, didn’t we win it? Of course…”

He smiled and continued, “Even if we lose, isn’t it just death?”

They gazed at him, and he grinned, “We’re already at a time like this, so let me be honest. Our goal is to disregard our lives and fight against it all. Fight to the death! Even if we die, we must die with dignity!”
