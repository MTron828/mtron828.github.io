Chapter 2226 – So Weak!

The middle aged man frowned slightly when he saw the claw.

A moment later, the huge claw was above him. He would be obliterated if it was allowed to descend, but he suddenly tapped his right foot down, and a thumb-sized rock by his foot transformed into a ray of sword energy that shot up into the air.

Bang!

The hideous claw was suddenly obliterated by the rock.

“You…” An astonished voice came from within the altar.

The middle aged man walked slowly toward the altar. Suddenly, a strand of black energy that carried a monstrous aura rippled out from the altar.

It moved to envelop the middle aged man.

Suddenly, a ray of sword energy flashed.

Hiss!

The energy was instantly sliced into bits and vanished into thin air. It was like it had never been there!

A furious shout came from within the altar, “Who are you?!”

Along with the voice, a huge demon beast appeared before the middle aged man.

Or to be more precise, it was a Demonspawn!

There was a difference between Demonspawn and demon beasts. Demonspawn could be described as the ancestors of demon beasts. When the chaos existed, only Demonspawn lived, and there were no demon beasts. The Demonspawn was shaped like a person, but it had three claws, and just one eye at the center of its forehead. Besides that, it was covered in pitch black scales, causing it to seem extremely strange and hideous.

The middle aged man stopped, sized up the Demonspawn, and said, “According to my knowledge, the Demonspawn from during the times of chaos should be quite strong. So why are you so weak?”

“Weak?” The Demonspawn had a ferocious expression on its face, “Damnable human! You think I’m weak?”

Hiss!

Suddenly, the middle aged man flicked a ray of sword energy forward.

The Demonspawn’s expression changed drastically. It raised its claw and slapped it forward. The entire city was obliterated beneath its force, and even the entire surroundings dimmed down like the end of the world was here!

However, the ray of sword energy ignored everything and obliterated everything in its path.

Bang!

The Demonspawn was blasted away, and a claw flew up into the air.

Bam!

The Demonspawn slammed against the ground, causing a huge crater to appear there.

A short while passed before it crawled out of there, and it gazed at the middle aged man while fear filled its eyes, “W-Who are you?”

Astonishment!

At this moment, the Demonspawn was beyond shocked.

The strength of the man before him had entirely exceeded its imagination!

Not to mention the current era, even during its own era, only a handful possessed such strength!

The middle aged man glanced at it and said, “What Demonspawn was the strongest during your time?” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

The Demonspawn glanced at him and replied, “Jufu, Zhongming, Aohen, Hengtian.”

The middle aged man pondered deeply for a moment and said, “What a pity.”

He turned around and walked away, but it only took a moment for him to stop. The Demonspawn’s expression changed from the sight of this, and it became inwardly vigilant.

The middle aged man said, “If I wanted to kill you, it would take a single strike even at your prime. I have a question, why did you attack me?”

The Demonspawn glanced at him and replied, “Out of habit…”

The middle aged man glanced at it and said, “Two people were here earlier, and you wanted to kill them, right?”

The Demonspawn hesitated for a moment and nodded.

The middle aged man spoke softly, “There are some ties between me and that man. If you leave now, he wouldn’t be able to resist your strength. Since that’s the case, I…”

“I guarantee that I won’t harm him!” Meanwhile, the Demonspawn hurriedly said, “Don’t worry, I won’t harm him.” It paused for a moment and continued, “I was sealed by the initial race for countless years, and I’ve only just escaped. I hope you’ll allow me to live.”

Needless to say, it was being really humble.

It had no other choice!

It was very well aware of the strength that the middle aged man possessed, and how inconceivable it was. The middle aged man’s strength wasn’t something it could resist at all. So, refusing to swallow its pride now would be no different than asking for death.

The middle aged man nodded, “Alright!”

He turned around and walked away.

The Demon Spawn heaved a huge sigh of relief at the sight of this. It glanced at its shoulder, and it was smooth as a mirror. Only one of its three claws remained there. The most terrifying part was that it still wasn’t able to make its lost claw regrow!

At this moment, the Demonspawn felt even greater reverence toward the middle aged man.

A short while passed before it shook its head. It didn’t leave but returned to the altar instead.

It was healing!

It had decided to recuperate before leaving.

…

The middle aged man left the altar and arrived where Yang Ye and the Universe Sprite had spoken to the Initial. He glanced at the surroundings and tapped his foot down lightly.

Bang!

The entire ground shook, and then a ray of sword energy descended to the center of the formation.

The middle aged man looked at the formation and said, “Three breaths of time. If you don’t show yourself by then, then you don’t have to, ever!”

A violent declaration!

A moment of silence ensued before the formation circulated, and then the Initial appeared before him.

“Your sword…” The Initial spoke softly, “It’s unprecedented. I never expected an expert like you to exist in the large universe.”

The middle aged man flicked a blood red heart to the Initial, and it was still beating.

“You’re been there!” The Initial’s voice grave and carried a trace of solemnness.

The middle aged man nodded slightly, “I’m sure you know of its origins, right?”

The Initial remained silent.

“I’m not very fond of killing!” The middle aged man spoke abruptly, “Because not many are worth killing. Do you understand what I mean?”

The Initial spoke solemnly, “You’re looking for the owner of this heart!”

The middle aged man replied, “I’m a little interested!”

The Initial fell silent for a long time and said, “Its owner is not in this universe.”

Not in this universe!

The middle aged man nodded slightly, “I see!”

He turned around and walked away.

Meanwhile, the Initial suddenly asked, “May I ask why you’re looking for that existence?”

The middle aged man stopped and replied, “I think he’s a little strong, so…”

“Allow me to be frank!” Meanwhile, the Initial said, “That existence isn’t just a little strong but very strong. I know your strength is at the peak, but that existence…”

“The peak?” The middle aged man shook his head slightly, “Do you know what’s the most painful thing in this world? As far as I’m concerned, it’s being invincible. From some point in time, I’ve been unable to sense danger at all. When a person can’t sense danger, that person will be unable to advance further. And I know that my sword isn’t at the level that I want. It can still improve. I need opponents, strong opponents. Unfortunately, only a few in this universe can be opponents of mine. They make me feel a little danger, but…”

He shook his head, “But it’s just a little.”

As soon as he finished speaking, a sword floated silently before him.

If Yang Ye was here, he would recognize the sword.

The middle aged man gazed at the sword for a long time and said, “I haven’t raised my sword in many years because no one has the right to make me.”

“According to my knowledge, those two existences from the undying race, and the Void Spirit Maiden…” Meanwhile, the Initial spoke softly, “All three of them…”

“Them?” The middle aged man shook his head, “Void Spirit Maiden isn’t bad. Unfortunately, she hasn’t awakened completely. However, I will wait for her, until she awakens completely. As for those two from the undying race, they aren’t at their peak either. So, I’ll wait for them too. Once I’ve fought them, I’ll come for all of you. I hope the initial race is stronger!”

He turned around and walked away once he finished speaking.

Meanwhile, the Initial spoke abruptly, “What if they defeat you?”

The middle aged man stopped for a moment and said, “Are you talking about all three of them joining forces?”

The Initial pondered deeply for a moment and said, “That young man from before, what is he to you…”

The middle aged man spoke softly, “I want to see the limits of the Sword Dao of emotion!”

“I see!” The Initial spoke softly, “He seems to be without emotion, but he is actually full of it. His sword has emotions as its core, so if he can stay true to his heart, he will definitely become a peerless sword cultivator. But you and him…”

A smile curled up on the middle aged man’s mouth, and his smile had deep meaning within it.

He didn’t say anything and just vanished.

“Confidence!” The Initial spoke softly, “What a powerful sword cultivator! He’s absolutely unprecedented!”

The Initial was just about to vanish when he looked up at the sky, “Another one is here… How powerful!”

A young girl descended to the ground in the distance.

She glanced at the surroundings and started walking toward the Initial. However, she frowned slightly when she passed the altar, and then she gazed at it. At the same time, the Demonspawn gazed at her.

Her aura was restrained within her, so it was impossible to discern anything extraordinary about her.

She’d merely glanced at the Demonspawn before withdrawing her gaze, and then she started walking toward the Initial. However, the Demonspawn suddenly smiled slyly, “She’ll definitely taste good!”

As soon as it finished speaking, it pounced at her.

The young girl suddenly gazed at it, and something appeared on her forehead.

Netherworld Destiny!
