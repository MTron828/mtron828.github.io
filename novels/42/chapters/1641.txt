Chapter 1642 - No! It’s Just The Beginning!

Translator: InVader

Yang Xu laughed coldly while Yang Yan ceaselessly swung the whip.

Little Sky’s body was growing more and more ethereal as Yang Yan’s whip descended incessantly upon her, and her aura was growing weaker as well.

“Do you feel despair?” Yang Yan gazed at Yang Ye, “Weren’t you looking for me? Now that you’ve found me, you…”

His eyes suddenly narrowed when he spoke up to this point while Yang Xu frowned instead.

Yang Ye’s body suddenly started to gradually turn red. First, it was his eyes. His eyes became pearls of blood, and they seemed like they were filled with an ocean of blood. After that, his body started to turn blood red. In the end, when even his hair turned blood red…

Bang!

A wave of intent surged out from within him.

Slaughter Sword Intent!

However, once it surged out from him, the sword intent within it was suddenly suppressed back into his body by his slaughter intent. Once his sword intent vanished completely…

Boom!

A ray of blood red light suddenly shot up into the sky. In just an instant, the sky above Phecda City had turned blood red, and it seemed like a blood red veil had been placed over it.

At the same time, Yang Ye’s slaughter intent was growing stronger and stronger…

Finally, at a certain moment in time…

Boom!

A wave of slaughter intent shot up into the sky, and it instantly enveloped the entire city. Moreover, it was still growing stronger and stronger. The slaughter intent gradually made the sky change from blood red to dark red.

Bang!

Another wave of terrifying slaughter intent surged out from within Yang Ye again. Once it appeared from him, the eyes of the Zenith Realm experts behind Yang Xu actually started turning red.

The Zenith Rank!

His slaughter intent had arrived at its limits! It was at the Zenith!

The entire Yang Clan was shocked!

In an instant, numerous auras rushed towards the area outside Phecda City.

At the moment Gu Xiu and the others, who were watching from afar, saw Yang Ye’s slaughter intent attain the Zenith Realm, their faces became extremely solemn. Obviously, all three of them hadn’t expected his slaughter intent to actually rise to the Zenith Realm!

Returnal Rank intents weren’t a huge threat to them, but Zenith Rank intents were quite a huge threat to them. Especially those intents that had been truly raised to the zenith, and Yang Ye’s slaughter intent was like that.

Because he hadn’t relied on external forces to forcefully advance to the Zenith Rank, and he’d relied on his own desire to kill.

Since his slaughter intent had arrived at the Zenith Rank, it was obvious how strong his desire to kill was right now!

Regardless of whether it was Yang Xuan, Gu Xiu, or Qian Hu, they had extremely solemn expressions on their faces. However, there was a slightly strange expression in Yang Xuan’s eyes.

Meanwhile, at another corner, a grey robed old man had a strange smile on the corners of his mouth, “Zenith Rank slaughter intent. This cousin brother of mine isn’t ordinary. This is quite interesting.”

Meanwhile, the black robed old man behind him said, “Eldest Young Master, what do you think about him?”

The grey robed man was the Yang Clan’s Eldest Young Master, Yang Jian!

Yang Jian glanced at Yang Ye and replied, “His strength isn’t bad, but he’s too impulsive…” He paused for a moment and added, “However, perhaps he has some sort of trump card. Let’s watch for now!”

The black robed old man nodded, glanced at the surroundings, and said, “The other young masters are here too.”

Yang Jian shot a glance towards the distance, “Zenith Rank slaughter intent… Haha, not to mention them, even those stubborn old geezers from the Council of Elders have come.”

…

Meanwhile, at the moment Yang Ye’s slaughter intent arrived at the Zenith Rank, both Yang Yan and Yang Xu’s faces fell!

The Zenith Rank!

They hadn’t expected Yang Ye to attain the Zenith Rank in an intent, and it was even slaughter intent. It could be said that amongst all the various intents, slaughter intent was one of the few that were comparatively difficult to improve. Because one had to kill a sufficient number of people. Besides that, one had to possess a sufficiently strong desire to kill! It had to be strong to the absolute limit!

Killing wasn’t terrifying, but the desire to kill was terrifying. Only one in a million could bring their desire to kill to its very limits!

A moment of silence ensued, and then Yang Xu laughed coldly, “Zenith Rank slaughter intent. It’s quite surprising indeed. But so what? You’re still an ant!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he was about to attack. However, Yang Ye suddenly started walking slowly in his direction. Every step Yang Ye took left a blood red footprint behind, “I’ll annihilate your entire line! Every single one of them!”

Yang Ye transformed into a ray of blood red light that vanished on the spot, and he was in front of Yang Xu just a moment later. After that, a blood red beam of sword energy slammed down in Yang Xu’s direction.

Yang Xu’s eyes narrowed slightly, and he immediately raised his hand and slapped his palm forward.

Bang!

An explosion resounded, and then a ray of blood red light and a wave of energy swept out from between them. But this time, the blood red light instantly swallowed the wave of energy, and it only took an instant for the blood red light to slam against Yang Xu.

Bang!

Yang Xu was pushed almost 1km back. Yang Ye didn’t pursue Yang Xu, and his sword just spun and transformed into a ray of blood red light that shot towards Yang Yan.

Yang Yan’s eyelids twitched at the sight of this. He immediately raised the whip in his grasp and swung it in Yang Ye’s direction.

Bang!

The whip was instantly blasted apart while Yang Yan himself was pushed around 3km back.

Yang Ye didn’t pursue Yang Yan. He stomped his right foot down and charged towards Little Sky instead.

He intended to save her first!

However, he hadn’t even arrived before Little Sky when Yang Xu suddenly appeared before him. After that, Yang Xu clenched his right fist tightly and slammed it towards Yang Ye. The space in front of his fist instantly caved in before exploding apart.

Boom!

The powerful aftershock from the explosion of space instantly shattered the ray of blood red light, but the powerful force contained within Yang Ye’s sword energy still pushed Yang Xu around 1km back. However, Yang Ye was similarly pushed around 1km back!

Yang Xu’s eyes narrowed slightly while icy coldness covered his face. He hadn’t expected that Yang Ye’s strength would actually become so formidable once his slaughter intent attained the Zenith Rank. He hadn’t expected Yang Ye to be able to fight him! Yang Ye’s strength wasn’t stronger than his, but Yang Ye could rely on his slaughter intent to fight against Yang Xu.

The slaughter intent belonged to Yang Ye, so it was a type of strength!

Yang Ye stood there with his sword in hand. Actually, it should be called a blood sword. Because his sword had been corroded by his slaughter intent and turned blood red. Moreover, a bloody glow and the aura of blood was being ceaselessly emanated from him.

Yang Xu gazed at Yang Ye for a long time before he suddenly waved his right hand, “Kill him!”

As soon as he gave the order, the other ten Zenith Realm experts immediately charged towards Yang Ye while Yang Xu transformed into a string of afterimages as he shot towards Yang Ye.

Eleven Zenith Realm experts!

Meanwhile, Yang Yan laughed ferociously, “Yang Ye, watch! I’ll kill this Lord of the Heaven Dao right now.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he leaped up and charged towards Little Sky.

A savage expression instantly covered Yang Ye’s face. He was about to activate the Laws of Darkness. However, the terrifying auras of eleven Zenith Realm experts descended in layers and sealed off the space around him. The space around him was compressed like a biscuit beneath their auras.

Meanwhile, Yang Yan had arrived before Little Sky, and he slapped his palm down in her direction.

If Little Sky was struck by it, then she would definitely die!

Yang Ye’s eyes almost split apart from rage. Suddenly, a ray of energy from a saber appeared in front of Yang Yan.

Bang!

Yang Yan was caught off guard, the saber energy blasted him 300m away!

Meanwhile, a man with a saber in his hand appeared in front of Little Sky.

Lu Lige!

It was Lu Lige!

Yang Ye visibly relaxed when he witnessed this, and then he waved his right hand. Two Blood Puppets appeared in front of him.

Bang! Bang! Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

As soon as they appeared here, two extremely powerful auras and a wave of terrifying slaughter intent erupted. The impact from the auras of the two Blood Puppets and Yang Ye’s slaughter intent instantly repulsed the auras of the Zenith Realm experts. At the same time, the space around Yang Ye cracked apart! Besides that, Yang Xu and the others had been blasted over 1km away!

Yang Ye didn’t stay on the spot for another moment. His figure immediately charged towards Little Sky. However, Yang Xu suddenly appeared behind Yang Ye and slapped his palm towards Yang Ye’s back.

Meanwhile, the Blood Puppets were being kept busy by the other ten Zenith Realm experts.

Lu Lige hurriedly shouted, “Watch out!”

Yang Ye suddenly stopped, and then he turned around and drew his sword!

Bang!

Yang Xu was pushed around 300m back while Yang Ye was similarly pushed 300m back by the force in Yang Xu’s palm. But it only took a moment for him to charge at Yang Ye again. At the same time, his voice resounded, “Attack! Kill that woman first!”

As soon as he gave the order, numerous auras suddenly charged out from within Phecda City, and their target was Little Sky!

Suddenly, the profound energy within Yang Ye surged madly into the Flash Boots on his feet, and then he instantly vanished on the spot.

Yang Xu’s expression changed drastically at the instant that Yang Ye vanished, “Yan’er! Watch out!”

Yang Yan’s expression had changed drastically as well, but it was too late. Because a sword had appeared from behind him and was placed across his throat before he could even react.

Yang Xu and the others immediately stopped on the spot when they witnessed this scene.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye brought Yang Xu over to Little Sky, and the Blood Puppets and Lu Lige were by his side.

Yang Xu stared at Yang Ye, “Let him go.”

“It’s time for this farce to end!” Meanwhile, an old man in linen robes appeared here abruptly, and there was a small ‘戒’ embroidered on his chest.

He was an elder of the Discipline Hall!

“End?” Yang Ye laughed ferociously and said, “No! It’s just the beginning!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye started to pull his sword back slowly.

Hiss!

His sword instantly cut into Yang Yan’s throat, causing blood to spray. However, Yang Ye still continued cutting slowly…
