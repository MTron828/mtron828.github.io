Chapter 1239 – Who Do You Think You Are?

Yang Ye turned around to look at Yun Banqing, “Do I seem so weak that everyone thinks they can walk all over me?”

Yun Banqing glanced at him and replied, “Slightly!”

Yang Ye patted himself on the forehead, “Looks like I’ve been keeping a low profile for too long.”

Yang Ye gazed at Yu Mo as he spoke, “There’s no enmity between us, so why do this?”

“Cut the fucking crap!” Yu Mo pointed a finger at Yang Ye and continued, “Now, I’m going to start counting. If you’re still here once I count to 3, then I guarantee that you’ll....”

Yu Mo’s voice stopped abruptly because Yang Ye had suddenly appeared in front of him, and then he hadn’t even been able to react before Yang Ye’s hand clamped down on his throat.

Yang Ye gazed at Yu Mo who had terror written all over his face and smiled, “Go on and count. Come on, count for me!”

Yu Mo gazed at Yang Ye with terror, and he was horrified to the extreme in his heart. Because he hadn’t been able to fight back at all!

“You refuse to count?” Yang Ye continued, “Then I will. If you’re still here once I count to 3, then I guarantee that I’ll break your neck! Let’s begin now! One!”

Yu Mo’s eyes were opened wide and seemed to be begging with his eyes. Besides that, his body was moving incessantly as he tried to struggle free of Yang Ye’s grasp. However, it was all in vain.

Yang Ye smiled, “Two!”

Yu Mo’s eyes opened wider, and his bloodshot eyes almost popped out of their sockets.

The smile on Yang Ye’s face grew wider, “Three!”

As soon as he spoke.

Crack!

The sound of bones breaking resounded, and then Yu Mo’s neck was broken!

Yang Ye casually tossed away Yu Mo’s corpse before swinging his fist forward. A wave of force rippled out and slammed against Yu Mo’s corpse, instantly transforming it into a pile of mush.

Yang Ye withdrew his gaze and looked at Yun Banqing, “Let’s look for a place to rest tonight. We’ll head out to Sword God’s Palace in the morning!”

Yun Banqing nodded.

Meanwhile, he glanced at the surroundings before his gaze descended onto a damaged pavilion, “Let’s go!”

As soon as he finished speaking, both he and Yun Banqing leaped up to the top level of the pavilion. Its walls were still intact, but its roof was gone.

Yang Ye waved his right hand, and the dust on the ground instantly vanished, “Just make do for tonight!”

Yun Banqing nodded and sat down cross-legged on the ground. Meanwhile, 10 violet crystals suddenly appeared before her. She looked at Yang Ye and head him say, “Recover to your peak!”

She replied, “Thank you!”

Yang Ye nodded slightly, laid down on the ground, and looked up at the sky. The sky was still pitch black like a huge black hole!

Meanwhile, Snowy’s head suddenly emerged from his chest. She glanced at the surroundings, and then laid down on Yang Ye’s chest while holding tightly to his neck.

The black ape had truly terrified her earlier! Even now, she was still afraid!

Yang Ye rubbed Snowy’s head and spoke gently, “Don’t be afraid, no one can bully you while I’m here!”

Snowy looked up at Yang Ye before stretching her claws to the side and waving them incessantly. It seemed like she was telling him how huge the black ape was.

Yang Ye smiled, “I’ve scared him away! So, you don’t have to fear him at all. Understand?”

Snowy blinked, pointed at Yang Ye, pointed at herself, and then started waving her claws again.

Yang Ye replied, “Of course, I’ll always protect you. No one can bully you!”

Snowy’s eyes narrowed when she heard this, and she revealed a brilliant smile. After that, she ceaselessly rubbed her furry head against Yang Ye’s chin.

Yun Banqing was flabbergasted. Because she couldn’t figure out what Snowy was saying! A short while passed before she gazed at Yang Ye and said, “You... you can really understand her?”

Yang Ye immediately had a bitter smile on his face when he heard her. Because he recalled his experiences with the violet mink all those years ago. Especially in the beginning, he’d truly been tortured by her. It could be said that the violet mink had tempered his skills in the beast tongue to its current state!

Yang Ye hurriedly grabbed Snowy in his hands when he thought of the violet mink, and he spoke seriously, “Has your Big Sister Zi’er still not emerged from her closed door cultivation?” She’d been cultivating behind closed doors for a very long time, yet she still wasn’t done until now. So, Yang Ye couldn’t help but be slightly worried.

Snowy started waving her claws incessantly.

A short while passed before Yang Ye’s face gradually eased up, “You’re saying that she’ll be done soon? Moreover, she has become extremely strong?”

Snowy quickly nodded.

“That’s good!” Yang Ye quickly nodded as well, and then he sized up Snowy, “You’ve absorbed that much spirit energy, so why haven’t you advanced?”

Snowy blinked. Obviously, she didn’t understand what Yang Ye meant.

Yang Ye shook his head and gently rubbed Snowy’s head, “It’s fine! Let’s sleep!”

Snowy nodded, and then she laid down on his chest and held tightly to him.

Yang Ye grinned, and then he closed his eyes slowly.

Yun Banqing glanced at Yang Ye and closed her eyes as well.

The atmosphere here fell silent, and only a light breeze blew by.

Time passed slowly, and it didn’t take long for it to go late into the night.

Suddenly, a shadow leaped up to the top of the pavilion and floated down towards Yang Ye. However, it had just arrived before Yang Ye when Yang Ye’s eyes opened, causing the shadow’s expression to change. A moment later, Yang Ye’s hand was clamped around the shadow’s throat.

Crack!

His head tilted to the side as life drained out of his eyes.

It didn’t take long for a corpse to be tossed out of the pavilion. At the same time, a figure leaped off the top of the pavilion, and then cracking resounded incessantly below the pavilion.

A short while later, everything returned to calm once more.

It was naturally Yang Ye. He tossed away the corpse in his grasp, and then he glanced at the surroundings. It didn’t take long for the figures hiding in the shadows to vanish.

Yang Ye withdrew his gaze and leaped back up to the top of the pavilion. He glanced at Yun Banqing who seemed to have fallen into deep sleep, and then he laid against the corner of the wall and closed his eyes slowly.

At the moment Yang Ye’s eyes closed shut, Yun Banqing suddenly opened her eyes, and she glanced at Yang Ye before closing her eyes once more.

The next day. Dawn had just arrived when Yang Ye and Yun Banqing left the pavilion, and they headed towards the distant streets.

“Sword God’s Palace is a few tens of thousands of kilometers behind Sword City, and it’s countless times larger than the city. However, many of its buildings have collapsed, so there’s no obvious path. The only way to get deep within Sword God’s Palace is exploration. Besides that, sword intent surges through the area, and the chaotic sword intent there is very terrifying. Even Emperors might perish if they are targeted by the sword intent there.” Yun Banqing spoke softly as they walked, “Besides that, it’s said that vengeful spirits reside in the depths of Sword God’s Palace. They are the spirits of the dead experts from Sword God’s Palace, and they are extremely dangerous. If we aren’t careful and encounter them, then it’ll practically definitely lead to our death. Moreover, sword formations are all over the area. Even though the sword formations are damaged, their strength can’t be underestimated. As for the complete sword formations, they are even more terrifying. In short, we have to be careful.”

Yang Ye looked up towards the distance, “So long as we enter Sword God’s Palace, it won’t be dangerous but safe to me.”

Yun Banqing’s eyelids twitched. She glanced at him and remained silent. But she slowly clenched her fists.

Suddenly, Yang Ye and Yun Banqing stopped because over 20 people were standing in front of them, and a bald man with a huge axe in his grasp led the group.

All of them were Quasi Emperors!

The bald man’s gaze descended onto Yang Ye, “You killed my brother?”

Yang Ye frowned, “Your brother?”

“It was him!” Meanwhile, a young man beside the bald man spoke, “He tossed Second Brother’s corpse down the pavilion last night!”

“So you were talking about him!” Yang Ye nodded, “I did kill him!”

“Who the fuck gave you the courage to kill a brother of mine?” The bald man gazed at Yang Ye and Yun Banqing as he spoke ferociously, “Don’t kill the woman, but don’t kill the man as well. Keep them alive!”

As soon as he finished speaking, 2 people by his side charged at Yang Ye and Yun Banqing. However, they’d only just charged forward when they were blasted flying, and their bodies transformed into piles of mush as they flew through the air.

The bale man and the others’ expressions changed drastically at the sight of this. Meanwhile, Yang Ye appeared in front of the bald man.

The bald man’s pupils constricted, and then he swung his axe down at Yang Ye.

Bang!

The axe stopped when it was around 10cm above Yang Ye’s head because Yang Ye had grabbed its blade!

The bald man was shocked. Meanwhile, his axe left his grasp, and then Yang Ye slammed it down at the bald man.

It was a similar swing of the axe, but the outcome was completely different!

Hiss!

The bald man was chopped into 2 and both internal organs and blood sprayed all over the ground.

The others were stunned, and the sound of wind being torn apart resounded when they finally recovered from their shock. After that, the axe started flying towards them.

In just a few breaths of time, over 20 corpses were lying on the ground.

Yang Ye patted his hands together and gazed at Yun Banqing, “Let’s go!”

She glanced at him, nodded, and followed behind him.

“You’re too violent!” Yun Banqing spoke abruptly after some time passed.

“Violence is good for resolving problems!” Yang Ye glanced at her while he spoke, “Don’t tell me you think they were pitiable.”

She shook her head, “They targeted us last night. If we were weak, then we would be the ones who suffered and not them.”

Yang Ye said, “People like to feel pity for the weak, yet they don’t realize that many of the weak aren’t worthy of pity. Because if they had the chance, those weak people would be even more cruel and ruthless than others!”

Yun Banqing nodded slightly, and then she just sped up in silence.

After a long time passed, both of them arrived before the city gates. But right when they were about to leave the city, a voice suddenly resounded from behind them, “Wait!”

Both of them stopped and turned around to look towards the source of the voice. Lin Huang’s group was walking towards then, and it was Lin Huang who’d spoken those words. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Yang Ye glanced at Lin Huang before he took Yun Banqing’s hand, turned around, and continued forward.

Lin Huang and the others were stunned by this scene, and then their faces turned gloomy. Especially Lin Huang.

Lin Huang’s figure flashed forward to obstruct Yang Ye and Yun Banqing’s path. He looked Yang Ye in the eyes and said, “I asked you to wait! Didn’t you hear me?”

Yang Ye took a step forward and looked straight at Lin Huang, “Who do you think you are?”
