Chapter 1823 – Kill Me!

Surrender?

Nangong Tian and the others were quite stunned when they heard Yang Ye. They thought they’d heard wrongly.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye added, “Don’t kill me if I surrender, alright?”

Nangong Tian and the others exchanged glances. This time, they were sure they hadn’t misheard,

A moment of silence ensued, and then Nangong Tian gazed at Yang Ye, “Hand it over and you can leave!”

Lu Gu seemed to want to say something, but Nangong Tian stopped him with a wave of the hand.

Yang Ye thought for a moment and said, “Alright, I’ll give you the wooden sword!”

As he spoke, he gazed at the wooden sword while his eyes flickered with reluctance, sadness…

Nangong Tian and the others stared at Yang Ye. At this moment, their breathing had quickened slightly.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye waved his right hand, and the wooden sword flew over to Nangong Tian.

After he tossed the sword to Nangong Tian, Yang Ye had turned around and vanished on the spot.

At this moment, no one paid any attention to Yang Ye, and everyone was looking at Nangong Tian. Because the sword was in his possession.

Nangong Tian slowly stroked the wooden sword with a trace of excitement in his eyes, “Even though it’s in a sealed state, it’s a good sword, a peerless sword!”

He seemed to have thought of something at this point, and he turned around to glance at the others, “Don’t worry, I’m not someone who goes back on his word. Let’s hold the competition right now. Of course, before we begin, I’d like to ask if anyone doesn’t want to participate. If you choose not to participate, you can get a Lifespan Fruit immediately and leave safely!”

Many fell silent.

A short while passed before a middle aged man stepped forward, “City Governor Nangong, I won’t be participating!”

Nangong Tian nodded slightly, and then he waved his hand. A crystalline and translucent fruit appeared before the middle aged man.

The middle aged man cupped his fist to Nangong Tian, “Thank you!”

He took the fruit and vanished into the sky.

Once there was a first, it didn’t take long for a second, a third, and a fourth to appear.

In just a short while, 40 out of the 50 plus here had decided against participating.

It was normal because while they would have to obtain the wooden sword, they may also die. Those who left knew their own strength well, and they knew it was utterly insufficient to fight an expert like Nangong Tian.

Moreover, even if they obtained it, their strength wasn’t enough to keep it.

So, they’d decisively chosen to take the fruit and leave.

They were satisfied with obtaining a Lifespan Fruit.

Only 12 people remained here now.

Nangong Tian glanced at them. In the end, he gazed at Lu Gu. At the same time, Lu Gu said, “I’ve consumed three Lifespan Fruits!”

Nangong Tian was slightly stunned, and then he nodded, “I understand!”

One could only consume three Lifespan Fruits at most. Moreover, its effects diminished with every time. So, consuming another would only provide practically insignificant effects.

Nangong Tian said, “Since that’s the case, let’s begin right now. We’ll divide ourselves into two groups. The winning six will fight again in two groups, and then the final three will decide on the victor. Alright?”

Lu Gu nodded, “I have no objections!”

The others nodded to display that they didn’t object as well!

It didn’t take long for them to be divided into two groups.

Nangong Tian waved his right hand, and they instantly appeared in space.

A spatial battlefield!

He would naturally not allow them to fight in the city. Even though the space in the city was extremely strong, the buildings in it weren’t. The buildings couldn’t endure their strength.

So, he’d created a battlefield in space!

Now, it was time to compete!

The 12 of them started their respective battles.

Two hours later, only six remained.

Amongst the other six, two had vanished from this world forever, and the remaining four had left the spatial battlefield.

The six winners were divided into two groups again, and they started fighting once more. This time, the fights were even more intense, and the entire battlefield shook violently.

Around four hours later.

Only three were left here. They were Lu Gu, Nangong Tian, and an old man in a gray robe. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

As for the other three, they’d perished.

The atmosphere here became quite heavy.

Meanwhile, the gray robed old man suddenly said, “City Governor Nangong, I have two juniors who are about to reach the end of their lifespan. I need four Lifespan Fruits to keep them alive. So….”

Nangong Tian pondered deeply for a moment and waved his right hand. Four Lifespan Fruits appeared before the old man.

The old man glanced at Nangong Tian, cupped his fist, and said, “Thank you!”

He took the fruits and immediately vanished from the battlefield!

Now, only Nangong Tian and Lu Gu remained.

Nangong Tian gazed at Lu Gu, “Brother Lu, do you have any requests? Or perhaps you want to fight to the death?”

Lu Gu fell silent for a long time, and then he looked up at Nangong Tian, “Actually, you wouldn’t hand it over even if I won, right?”

Nangong Tian spoke indifferently, “Brother Lu, why do you say that?”

Lu Gu chuckled, “It doesn’t matter. Brother Lu, I want four Lifespan Fruits as well. I wonder if that’s alright!”

Nangong Tian smiled, “Of course!”

He waved his right hand and four Lifespan Fruits appeared before Lu Gu.

Lu Gu took them and was about to leave. However, he seemed to have thought of something and stopped abruptly, “There’s something I find strange. Yang Ye doesn’t seem like someone who’ll make a compromise. However, he handed over the wooden sword so quickly….”

He smiled, didn’t speak further, and just vanished into the sky.

Nangong Tian frowned.

He flipped his palm, and the wooden sword appeared in his grasp. He fell into deep thought as he gazed at it. A short while passed before he seemed to have thought of something, and his expression changed drastically.

Om!

Suddenly, a sword howl resounded through the battlefield.

A ray of light flashed, and the powerful sword energy emanated from it caused the battlefield to be torn apart.

At this moment, Nangong Tian’s hairs were standing on end. A moment later, a terrifying aura swept out from him while he grabbed the wooden sword with both hands, turned around, and swung it.

However, he noticed to his astonishment that the wooden sword started to tremble violently. After that, a wave of powerful sword energy surged out from it.

If this happened a while ago, his strength would have been sufficient to suppress the wooden sword. Yet now, he couldn’t. Because there was another sword here, and that one was even more terrifying than the wooden sword. Because it was in the hands of someone!

So, he had to abandon the wooden sword.

As soon as he released it, the sword transformed into a ray of light that vanished from his field of vision.

Meanwhile, a sword had arrived just a few inches away from his forehead. However, the sword stopped when it arrived just before his forehead, and it was because he’d grabbed the sword with both hands.

Yang Ye was standing in front of him!

It was a trap!

At this moment, he finally understood that all of it was a trap!

Yang Ye had handed it over to break up their group and make them fight each other, and Yang Ye had succeeded. Once all the experts benefited from it, they’d left, and only he was left behind!

Suddenly, a smile curled up on Yang Ye’s face, and then the Ancient Spirit Python appeared on his right arm. After that, Yang Ye twisted his right hand.

Hiss!

Nangong Tian’s hands were minced apart.

Hiss!

A ray of light flashed through Nangong Tian’s forehead, and blood sprayed out like a fountain.

Yang Ye was behind Nangong Tian.

Meanwhile, Nangong Tian’s body stiffened, and his eyes were filled with bewilderment, “Such… such strength….”

As soon as he finished speaking, the color in his eyes gradually faded.

A short while later, there was no life left in Nangong Tian’s eyes.

Yang Ye waved his right hand and Nangong Tian’s head fell off his neck. After that, Yang Ye stored Nangong Tian’s corpse within the Primordial Pagoda.

Meanwhile, over a dozen powerful auras charged up into the sky from within the City Governor’s Estate on the ground below.

Yang Ye shot a glance at them. He didn’t choose to leave, and he just left Nangong Tian’s head in his left hand as he walked towards the entrance of the City Governor’s Estate. A moment later, he raised the wooden sword in his right hand and swung it at the City Governor’s Estate.

Om!

A sword howl resounded, and then a strand of sword energy, that stretched forward for over 300m, descended.

Boom!

It chopped the entire city into two.

Meanwhile, 13 6th stage True Realm experts appeared not too far away from Yang Ye.

Their expressions were extremely gloomy as they gazed at the city which had been chopped into two, and the gloominess in their eyes transformed into disbelief when they saw Nangong Tian’s head!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye gazed at them and pointed at himself, “Kill me if you can!”

Their faces grew even more unsightly.

But none of them dared to attack!

None!

Yang Ye ignored them and walked towards the city gates. Just like that, he walked out of the city while holding Nangong Tian’s head.

Every single step he took left a little blood behind on the ground. It was the blood that flowed down from Nangong Tian’s head.

Many auras were hiding in the surroundings, but none of them dared to attack!

Just like that, they watched as he held a bloody head in his hand and walked step by step out of the city.

Drip! Drip!

Only the sound of blood dripping down to the ground could be heard throughout the street.
