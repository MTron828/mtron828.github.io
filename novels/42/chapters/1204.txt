Chapter 1205 – Nine Emperor Realm Sword Servants!

90,000 violet crystals!

Just as Yang Ye had expected, Snowy had created over 90,000 violet crystals after absorbing the spirit energy within 9 Emperors!

90,000 violet crystals!

Yang Ye gasped as he gazed at the pile of violet crystals before him. Even if he possessed abundant experience in life, he was still unable to maintain his composure. After all, not to mention in Dark Hell Continent, 90,000 violet crystals was an astronomical figure even in the Radiant Dimension!

The Sword Alliance had its funds now!

What was needed to establish a power? There were 2 things that were vital. One was human resources, and the second was money. The Sword Alliance had enough members, and not it had enough money!

So long as the Sword Alliance was given time, it would definitely grow by leaps and bounds!

Unfortunately, Yang Ye knew that the Sword Alliance lacked time the most!

Meanwhile, Snowy flew over to Yang Ye, pointed at the mountain of violet crystals, pointed at Yang Ye, and then pointed at herself. In the end, she wrapped her arms around Yang Ye’s head and kissed him on the nose before transforming into a ray of white light that entered the area in front of his chest.

Yang Ye rubbed his nose and chuckled, and then he waved his right hand to put the violet crystals away. After that, he said, “Come in!”

As soon as he finished speaking, the door was opened and Ye Liuyun walked in.

“How’s the situation in the city?” asked Yang Ye. The Sword Alliance had just occupied the city, so there would definitely be numerous problems. Moreover, the World Devastator Cult had attacked just now, so the morale in the city was definitely shaky. He was quite worried that problems might arise. Even though he wasn’t afraid of facing problems, he was afraid of wasting time. Time was the most precious thing to him right now!

Ye Liuyun replied, “Our morale is shaky, but fortunately, it’s still within control.” She glanced at Yang Ye at this point and continued, “Have we really become enemies with the World Devastator Cult?”

Yang Ye smiled, “You’re afraid of them as well?”

“No one isn’t!” Ye Liuyun continued, “It’s a power that’s quite mysterious, but every single time they act, it would be sufficient to deter the entire continent. Not to mention any other previous event and just talk about today. They sent 11 Emperors in one go. It’s the only power throughout the continent that possesses such forces. Moreover, it’s very likely for them to possess experts above the Emperor Realm, and the possibility of that is huge!”

Yang Ye nodded and replied, “You don’t have to worry about that. You just have to manage the affairs within the city and the Sword Alliance. As for the external affairs, you have me. If you have to worry about the matters within and outside the city and the Sword Alliance, then I’m afraid that you might collapse!”

Ye Liuyun glanced at Yang Ye and said, “Alright.”

She’d heaved a sigh of relief when she heard Yang Ye. After all, the Sword Alliance had just entered Doomsday City and there was a huge number of things to deal with. Just that placed an immense amount of pressure on her. Now, the Sword Alliance has become enemies with the World Devastator Cult. Not to mention the others, even her heart was heavy when she thought about fighting the World Devastator Cult.

Fortunately, the worry in her heart had been alleviated.

Because Yang Ye was very calm and composed.

Since the moment she entered the room, what she feared the most was seeing Yang Ye with a frown and worry on his face. Fortunately, she hadn’t. He was just as he’d always been, filled with confidence! That allowed her to truly heave a sigh of relief. Because if even Yang Ye couldn’t stay calm and composed, then the Sword Alliance would truly be finished.

Yang Ye gazed at Ye Liuyun and smiled, “Miss Ye....”

She suddenly said, “Just call me Liuyun!”

“Alright!” Yang Ye nodded, “Liuyun, we’re on the same side, so I don’t want to keep anything from you. But it isn’t the right time for me to tell you some things. In short, you just have to understand that even if the sky falls, I’ll be there to hold it up. So, place too much pressure on yourself. Just act as you normally would. Understand?”

Ye Liuyun glanced at Yang Ye and said, “I’ll deal with the affairs within the city and Sword Alliance. You don’t have to worry about that.” She withdrew a spatial ring and said, “There are over 20,000 violet crystals here. All of them were collected from the previous City Governor’s Estate within the city.”

Yang Ye didn’t take it and asked instead, “Around how many violet crystals do you need right now?”

Ye Liuyun pondered deeply for a moment and said, “At least 50,000! Many of our members will be able to attain substantial increases in their strengths with those violet crystals. Besides that, in order to complete many things in the Sword Alliance like your point system, all of them need violet crystals to be fully established. In short, if we want to become an enormous power with a complete system of its own, then we need a massive number of violet crystals!”

Yang Ye flicked a spatial ring over to her and said, “There are 50,000 violet crystals in there. You have 70,000 if the violet crystals you obtained from the city are included. Ask me if it still isn’t enough!”

Ye Liuyun didn’t refuse it and took the spatial ring before she said, “Sword Master, that Emperor Realm puppet of yours....”

Yang Ye said, “He’ll stay by your side from now on. He’ll obey your commands and protect you as well.” He hadn’t summoned that Sword Servant back to his side even when he faced 5 Emperors on his own, and it was naturally because of Ye Liuyun. After all, she was extremely important right now, and he couldn’t allow anything to happen to her.

“Thank you!” Ye Liuyun bowed slightly to Yang Ye. Her strength wasn’t very strong within the Sword Alliance. Even though she had Yang Ye’s support, she lacked the ability to deter others, and her orders didn’t always have the expected effect. But with an Emperor obeying her commands, she could accomplish many things.

Yang Ye said, “Go on with your work!”

Ye Liuyun bowed slightly to him again, and then she turned around and left the room.

Yang Ye suddenly said, “Come in!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Nan Shuang walked into his room.

Yang Ye had slight surprise in his eyes as he gazed at her, “You’ve attained the Quasi Emperor Realm?”

Nan Shuang walked over to Yang Ye and bowed respectfully, “Sword Master.”

Yang Ye’s face froze. A short while passed before he said, “Why act like that?”

Nan Shuang lowered her head slightly and spoke softly, “Don’t you like that?”

He walked over to her and rubbed her head, “Do you think I do?”

She kept her head lowered, and she was drawing circles as she spoke softly, “I don’t know!”

Yang Ye suddenly said, “Look at me!”

She hesitated for a moment before raising her head to look at him. However, it didn’t take long for her to lower her head once more. She said, “How ugly!”

The corners of Yang Ye’s mouth twitched. He shook his head, took her hand, and brought her to a chair before he said, “Nan Shuang, do you think I think of you as a friend or subordinate? Don’t tell me that you don’t know, and don’t try to feign ignorance as well. Answer me seriously.”

Nan Shuang remained silent.

As he watched her remain silent, Yang Ye suddenly felt quite uncomfortable. He took Nan Shuang’s hand again and spoke softly, “Why are you acting like this today? Did I do something that hurt you?”

She shook her head.

“Nan Shuang, I won’t be happy if you don’t tell me anything.” Yang Ye continued, “In my heart, I’ve always taken you to be a very good friend. I believe that it’s the same for you. Right? Since we’re such good friends, it’s quite bad of you to keep things from me!”

She looked up at him and said, “You’re so strong, yet I... I’m so weak....”

Yang Ye was stunned, and then he couldn’t help but chuckle, “That’s why you’re unhappy?”

“Can’t I?” Nan Shuang clenched her fists and was slightly angry.

“Of course you can!” Yang Ye continued, “But I don’t really understand why you’re angry because of that? Do you have such a strong desire to be stronger than me?”

Nan Shuang nodded, “I do!”

Yang Ye was puzzled now, “Why?”

She glanced at him and spoke softly, “Because I’ll be able to bully you!”

Yang Ye was stunned. Meanwhile, she added, “I like to bully you like I did in the past. Unfortunately, I’m no match for you now.”

Yang Ye rubbed her head gently and said, “You can still bully me. I promise that I won’t fight back!”

She shook her head and said, “Gu Lan said that I can’t do that. Because you’re the Sword Master, so I have to be respectful.”

Gu Lan.... Yang Ye shook his head while a gentle gaze arose in his eyes, “Stupid fool. I never treated you as a subordinate, so why treat me as the Sword Master?”

“Right!” Nan Shuang blinked, “I seem to have suffered because of this.”

Yang Ye chuckled, “Terribly!”

A smile curled up on Nan Shuang’s face, and she gazed at Yang Ye for a short while before she said, “Was I a little too capricious today?”

Yang Ye nodded, and then Nan Shuang shot a slightly angry gaze at him. So, he hurriedly added, “But I like this version of you.”

Nan Shuang was stunned, and then she asked, “Why?”

“Because this is your true self!” Yang Ye smiled, “But you can’t act like that anymore. Because I’d be sad if you acted like that again.”

Nan Shuang glanced at him before she gave him a quick hug, “I’ll work hard, very hard!” As soon as she finished speaking, she turned around and walked out of the room. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Yang Ye grinned as he watched her leave, and then he waved his right hand and closed thew room door. After that, he waved his right hand again before 9 corpses appeared before him.

They were naturally the corpses of those 9 Emperors that he’d collected during the previous battles!

9 Emperor Realm Sword Servants!

The Sword Alliance’s strength was actually extremely weak right now. Especially when compared to the World Devastator Cult. After all, it could casually dispatch 11 Emperors, so how terrifying was such strength?

Yang Ye didn’t know exactly how strong the World Devastator Cult was, but he knew that it was absolutely not something that the Sword Alliance could go against. However, he would be much more confident once he had 9 Emperor Realm Sword Servants on his side.

Yang Ye glanced at them and started to refine them.
