Chapter 2138 – Attain the Dao Through Slaughter!

Yang Ye’s voice was ferocious and carried madness within it!

The other races had hunted him down so many times, and it had truly infuriated him.

He was absolutely furious!

Earlier, Yang Ye hadn’t retaliated because he couldn’t. Because he was still very weak then. Yet now, while his strength was still insufficient before them, he had the strength to fight back.

In the sky above Heaven’s Son City.

The Sovereign of Man’s face was extremely gloomy as he looked at the ruins of the city down below, and no one knew what he was thinking.

Meanwhile, the experts from the other races had quite gloomy expressions on their faces too. In the past, they had held onto the initiative, and they could hunt and kill Yang Ye whenever they wanted. Regardless of whether they succeeded in the end, they still held the right to decide when to attack and when to stop. But Yang Ye had started to counterattack now.

The facts proved that Yang Ye was absolutely ruthless.

Meanwhile, the Sovereign of Man suddenly said, “I’m sure you’ve noticed how terrifying his natural talent and potential are. His cultivation can be said to have risen by leaps and bounds, and we may die at his hands the next time he appears before us. I suggest that you use the resources of your races to annihilate him with me!”

“17 Sages!” Suddenly, an old man said, “If even 17 Sages can’t kill him, then I think we’ll all become the laughingstock of the large universe.”

The Sovereign of Man gazed at the old man, “If we kill him, we won’t become laughingstocks no matter how many people we mobilize. However, if we fail to kill him, then we’ll truly become laughingstocks.”

As he spoke, he glanced at the others, “Have all of you really not realized how terrifying he is? Let me ask you this. If he advances to the Sage Realm, how confident are all of you in being able to defeat him? Not to mention the Sage Realm, even now, how confident are you to defeat him now?”

All of them remained silent.

At this moment, they realized that Sages couldn’t do anything to Yang Ye right now!

One of the old men suddenly said, “He’s from the human race!”

Everyone gazed at the old man while wondering what he was trying to say. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

The old man continued, “Why don’t we make him work for us? If he’s willing to work for us, it’ll be an extremely good thing for our alliance. Of course, I know that it’s quite difficult under the current circumstances, but perhaps we can give it a try. Even if we fail, we can use the opportunity to eliminate him. What do all of you think?”

The Sovereign of Man fell silent for a moment and said, “He has quite a good relationship with an expert from the shaman race, Hou Qing. Moreover, the shaman race helped him all those years ago. How about we ask the shaman race to contact him? Of course, my personal suggestion is to make him show himself, and then ambush and kill him. As for advising him to submit to us, I think that we should just avoid asking for insult!”

The old man nodded, “Since that’s the case, let’s ask the shaman race to give it a try. Let’s make preparations too. Let’s strive to kill him this time and take possession of that Sprite Lord!”

Suddenly, the Sovereign of Man said, “Watch out!”

As soon as the Sovereign of Man said those words, two figures suddenly appeared in front of the old man. It was a man and a woman. They had appeared out of thin air there. In just an instant, the woman had raised her knee and slammed it at the old man’s head while the man had soundlessly appeared behind the old man. At the same time, a sword swept towards the old man’s nape.

They were Yang Ye and An Nanjing, of course!

They hadn’t left!

Their appearance here caused the expressions of all the Sages here to change drastically. They hadn’t expected Yang Ye to actually dare to show himself at a time like this! Moreover, he’d even shown himself with a woman!

It was especially so for the old man who they were jointly attacking, the old man’s hairs had stood on end.

Danger!

Extreme danger!

The old man was about to reach when an ethereal beast suddenly appeared behind An Nanjing.

It was the Martial Soul Beast!

Roar!

It roared furiously at the old man, and it caused the old man’s mind to instantly go blank. At this same instant, An Nanjing’s right knee slammed against the old man’s face.

Bang!

The old man’s head exploded apart. At the same time, a sword stabbed into his nape!

In an instant, the old man’s body was destroyed, but his soul floated out of his body and shot towards the distance.

Flee!

So long as his soul was preserved, it wouldn’t be difficult for him to recover his strength!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye was about to act, but An Nanjing was faster than him. An Nanjing’s figure transformed into a string of afterimages that shot towards the old man’s soul, and it only took her an instant to catch up to him.

The old man’s soul was visibly horrified, and he was just about to say something when An Nanjing raised her leg and kicked his soul.

Bang!

An explosion resounded, and the old man’s soul exploded apart and was obliterated.

He was completely dead!

Meanwhile, many figures appeared behind An Nanjing.

“Watch out!” As soon as he said that, Yang Ye had transformed into a ray of light that shot over to her.

An Nanjing turned around swiftly, raised her hand slightly, and then pressed it downward.

Boom!

With An Nanjing at the center, a wave of terrifying force swept out from within her, and it was like a torrent that could obliterate anything before it!

The Sages in front of her were caught off guard, and then were blasted over 1km back.

Once she blasted them away, An Nanjing retreated to Yang Ye’s side, and her countenance was slightly pale.

Yang Ye asked softly, “Are you alright?”

An Nanjing shook her head slightly, “I can fight two more!”

Yang Ye felt speechless.

Suddenly, the Sovereign of Man asked, “Who are you?! Why do you have the Martial Soul Beast?”

An Nanjing gazed at him and replied, “I don’t want to tell you!”

An unsightly expression instantly appeared on the Sovereign of Man’s face, and it was like he’d been fed a mouthful of shit. He didn’t waste his breath and intended to attack. But Yang Ye suddenly took An Nanjing with him and vanished into the sky.

“Chase them down!” As soon as he gave the order, over a dozen figures shot up into the air.

Far away in the sky, Yang Ye and An Nanjing rose their speed to their limits.

There were over a dozen Sages behind them!

However, there was excitement in Yang Ye’s eyes.

Instant annihilation!

Their joint forces had been able to instantly annihilate a Sage.

In the past, he’d given it his all just to kill a Sage, yet now, while he had to join forces with An Nanjing to accomplish it, Sages were of no threat to them!

Of course, it was limited to one or two Sages, if it was over a dozen, then they still could do nothing but flee!

An Nanjing asked, “Do you have any plans?”

Yang Ye shot a glance behind them and smiled, “Let them chase us. We’ll play with them slowly!”

An Nanjing was about to speak when Yang Lianshuang’s voice suddenly resounded in Yang Ye’s mind, “Did you destroy Heaven’s Son City?”

Yang Ye replied, “You got the news really quickly!”

Yang Lianshuang fell silent for a short while, and then she said, “The situation isn’t that good. I just received news that the Alliance of All has dispatched even more experts to surround you. You must find a way to get away from those Sages or you’ll be surrounded.”

Yang Ye frowned, “Have they gone mad? How many do they plan to send just to kill two Major Zen Realm cultivators?”

Yang Lianshuang replied, “It’s your fault. You have the Sprite Lord, and you joined forces with An Nanjing to kill a Sage. So, the Alliance of All feels threatened by both of you. If they don’t eliminate you now and allow both of you to become Sages, then they would probably be unable to do anything even if both of you attacked their base.”

Yang Ye wanted to say something, Yang Lianshuang said, “Find a way to get rid of them. Otherwise, you’ll fall into a worse situation. Don’t tell me that both of you can defeat the joint forces of at least 25 Sages.”

Yang Ye and An Nanjing exchanged glances, and then Yang Ye asked, “What do you think?”

She replied, “It’s up to you!”

Yang Ye laughed bitterly, “Aren’t you afraid that I’ll drag you into a trap?”

An Nanjing gazed at him and replied with a question, “Would you?”

Yang Ye smiled, “The luckiest thing in my life is meeting you.”

His relationship with An Nanjing was impossible to describe with just words.

An Nanjing glanced at Yang Ye and didn’t say anything. In her lifetime, there were only two things that she cared about, one was the Martial Dao, and the other was Yang Ye.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly took a deep breath and said, “I have an idea!”

She gazed at him, “What?”

Yang Ye smiled, “You’ll find out soon!”

Yang Ye stopped while he spoke those words, and so An Nanjing stopped as well.

Meanwhile, the Sovereign of Man’s group appeared not too far away from them.

The Sovereign of Man and the others instantly became vigilant when they saw that Yang Ye and An Nanjing had stopped here.

The Sovereign of Man glanced at the surroundings and gazed at Yang Ye, “What? You’re accepting your fate?”

Yang Ye replied indifferently, “Sovereign of Man, how many Sages does the human race have? Or I should ask, how many Sages do you have under you?”

The Sovereign of Man frowned, “What are you trying to say?”

Yang Ye smiled, “It’s nothing. I just want to tell you that you’re probably going to be all alone from now on!”

The Sovereign of Man was just about to say something when the space before him suddenly trembled slightly. It only took a moment for his expression to change drastically, and he gazed at Yang Ye and shouted furiously, “Yang Ye, you actually colluded with the god race. You… You…”

Yang Ye interrupted him and said, “Yes, I’m colluding with the god race. Sovereign of Man, let me tell you something. Even if the god race can’t annihilate you, I will. From this moment onward, I won’t spare any Sage from the Alliance of All that has tried to hunt me down. I’ll kill every single Sage from the Alliance of All. I’ve decided that I’m not going to continue on the path of the Sword Dao, I’m going to take the path of the Slaughter Dao! I’m going to attain the Dao through slaughter!”
