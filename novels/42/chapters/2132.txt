Chapter 2133 – Why Don’t You Try?

As soon as the young man finished speaking, Nether Maiden stopped and looked up at him, “Is that so?”

Her voice was very indifferent.

The more she acted like that, the more furious he got.

The young man suddenly tried to grab her, and she didn’t do anything in response. Right when his hand was about to grab her hair, a hand grabbed his wrist.

The young man turned around, and he saw a black robed man had suddenly appeared by his side.

“Fuck off!” The young man howled with fury.

Bam!

A figure was blasted flying, and it slammed into a house, causing the house to collapse.

All of this had happened too quickly, and it was to the point that the cavalry behind the young man hadn’t even been able to react to it.

However, they’d reacted now.

“How dare you!” One of them roared with fury and intended to attack.

Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!

Muffled explosions resounded incessantly, and all of them were instantly blasted away.

Everyone in the surroundings was stunned by this scene.

As for the black robed man, it was Yang Ye, of course.

Yang Ye walked over to Nether Maiden and said, “Long time no see!”

She looked him in the eyes, “It really is you!”

Yang Ye asked, “You noticed my presence?”

She replied, “I sensed your aura, but I wasn’t very sure.”

Yang Ye smiled, “Let’s talk somewhere else?”

She nodded, “Come with me!”

Suddenly, a ferocious voice came from afar, “You’re dead, you’re both dead!”

Yang Ye turned around and noticed it was the young man he’d slapped flying.

Yang Ye shook his head and gazed at Nether Maiden, “Let’s go!”

She turned around and walked away. Suddenly, the young man howled crazily, “Bitch! You bitch! I’ll make living worse than death for you, I’ll…”

His voice stopped abruptly because his head had soundless rolled off his neck.

The surroundings fell silent.

Yang Ye said, “Let’s go!”

Nether Maiden said, “You’re still so violent!”

Yang Ye replied, “It’s an old habit I can’t change.”

Nether Maiden nodded, “Come with me!”

Yang Ye followed Nether Maiden into an ordinary house. The furniture within it was very simple, just a bed, table, and chair. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Nether Maiden asked, “Did you come to see me for a reason?”

Yang Ye nodded, “Second Sister is on the verge of revival.”

Nether Maiden looked up at Yang Ye, and a long time passed before she said, “I knew you wouldn’t let me down.”

Yang Ye replied, “She died because of me, I…”

“There’s no need to blame yourself!” Nether Maiden continued, “She treated you like her own younger brother, and as far as she’s concerned, you’re as important as all of us sisters.”

Yang Ye said, “Let’s not continue on that topic. I came to give Second Sister to you. I think the first thing she would want upon waking up is to see all of you!”

Nether Maiden thought for a while and replied, “Alright!”

Yang Ye passed the casket to Nether Maiden. As for Zi’er, she was fine now, and it was only a matter of time before she woke up.

Yang Ye suddenly said, “Right, I have something to ask you!”

Nether Maiden gazed at him.

Yang Ye asked, “What do you know about your hall master, Shao Siyou?”

“Hall Master Siyou?” Nether Maiden frowned slightly, “Why?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “Just asking!”

Nether Maiden glanced at Yang Ye and said, “I don’t know much about her. All I do know is that she has always been very mysterious. However, Eldest Sister may know a little more!”

Sky Maiden!

Yang Ye asked, “Where has Sky Maiden gone?”

Nether Maiden replied, “The spirit race. She supposedly went to look for something. Right, why are you suddenly asking about Hall Master Shao Siyou? Has she shown herself?”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and shook his head, “It isn’t anything important. Anyway, I have some other things to do, so farewell. I’ll come visit you another day!”

Yang Ye turned around and left without the slightest hesitation.

Nether Maiden didn’t make him stay and just frowned slightly instead.

Around 15 minutes after Yang Ye left, a black robed figure appeared in the room.

Nether Maiden’s eyes narrowed slightly while she clenched her fists slowly. However, the black robed figure suddenly removed the black robe’s hood.

Nether maiden’s pupils constricted, “It’s you!”

The black robed figure nodded, “Come with me!”

The black robed figure turned around and left.

Nether Maiden fell silent on the spot for a moment, and then she followed the black robed figure.

…

Meanwhile, as soon as he left the city, a middle aged man and three old men obstructed Yang Ye’s path.

The middle aged man sized up Yang Ye and asked, “Who are you?”

Yang Ye glanced at them, and he noticed that all of them were at the Zen Realm.

Yang Ye said, “I presume you’re here for that young man from before!”

The middle aged man replied, “Yes!”

Yang Ye shook his head slightly, “I think all of you should leave.”

The middle aged man said, “I’m quite reluctant to do that!”

Yang Ye nodded, and then he vanished on the spot. As soon as he vanished, the middle aged man and the others’ expressions had changed drastically! The middle aged man’s reaction was slightly faster, and he was about to act. However, it was too late. A hand had grabbed his throat.

Yang Ye slowly lifted up the middle aged man, “I’m really not interested in anyone below the Sage Realm. However, since you insisted on courting death, I’ll fulfill your wish!”

Crack!

As soon as he finished speaking, the middle aged man’s head flew off into the distance.

Yang Ye turned to look at the remaining old men. One of them hurriedly said, “We… We are willing…”

As soon as he finished speaking, he transformed into a ray of light that shot swiftly toward the sky, and the other two followed close behind him!

Yang Ye shrugged and vanished on the spot.

Not long after Yang Ye vanished, Nether Maiden and the black robed figure appeared where he’d been standing.

The black robed figure asked, “Is he close to all of you?”

Nether Maiden nodded.

The black robed figure said, “Actually, he should be dead!”

Nether Maiden gazed at the black robed figure, and the latter explained, “He’s an uncertain factor in the large universe!”

Nether Maiden asked, “What do you mean?”

The black robed figure replied, “We’re planning something, but we don’t want any uncertain factors to exist, and he is one. Unfortunately, there are two extremely terrifying existences standing behind him, and even we have to fear them.”

Nether Maiden asked, “Even more terrifying than progenitors?”

The black robed figure chuckled with a voice that was pleasing and gentle like a bell.

The black robed figure looked up at the distant sky and said, “Progenitors aren’t the truly terrifying existences in this world. Because they have their own sects and shackles, so they have to consider many things when they do anything. However, that is their Dao, and it’s the support of their sects which allowed them to possess their current accomplishments. It’s an impasse that they cannot solve.”

The black robed figure paused for a moment and continued, “The truly terrifying are those experts without any shackles. They have no sects, and they care about very, very little. If the things they care about are gone, they will be without any further ties. Those people are the most terrifying. Those two existences who stand behind Yang Ye are such existences, so we dare not touch him. Once we do, those two existences will have nothing else to worry about. At that time, even we won’t be able to endure their revenge.”

Nether Maiden said, “Then isn’t he very safe?”

“Safe?” The black robed figure chuckled again, “He’s in the most danger. That fellow has come into contact with the god race, the three paths, the Evil Yin Sprite, the prehistoric race, and he even has a precious treasure of the Dao Path and a Sprite Lord. When all of those are included, he’s not safe at all. Especially that Sprite Lord. The end times are coming, and a Sprite Lord’s benefits are beyond your imagination. At that time, it will become the most precious treasure in the large universe that every single organization wants to possess. He won’t be able to keep it safe!”

Nether Maiden fell silent.

“Actually!” Meanwhile, the black robed figure continued, “I really admire that strategist of the god race. As expected of one with the Wiseman Physique. Her wisdom is truly perfect. Among all the organizations, only the god race has the best relationship with Yang Ye, so Yang Ye will definitely help if the god race is in trouble. Unfortunately…”

Nether Maiden asked, “Unfortunately what?”

The black robed figure explained, “If Shi Tian cannot return, then the god race will only remain a 2nd rate organization. Not to mention us, even any of the three paths will be able to annihilate them with ease if they are willing to pay a certain price!”

“Shi Tian?” Nether Maiden frowned slightly, “He can come back to life?”

The black robed figure replied, “I don’t know. However, Shi Tian is quite an extraordinary expert. The god race will be able to survive the end times and compete with the other organizations if he’s present. Otherwise, the god race will be kicked out of the game. That will lead to death. The Confucianist Path has already been kicked out!”

Nether Maiden had turned into a curious child, “Why did the Confucianist Path get kicked out?”

The black robed figure pondered deeply for a moment and replied, “The Confucianist Progenitor is a good person!”

Nether Maiden was puzzled, “Huh?”

The black robed figure said, “Amongst all the progenitors, the Confucianist Progenitor is the most upstanding person, and he’s the most likely to take that final step. However, that’s also why he was kicked out so quickly. Once he succeeds, then even if he just takes half a step forward, the history of this world will be changed, and that’s something countless people don’t want to see happen. So, he was bound to never succeed. He knew that too, so he never chose to try. Unfortunately, he couldn’t suppress it in the end.”

The black robed figure shook their head, “Do you know? Seven Progenitor Realm experts joined forces against him that day!”

Seven progenitors!

Nether Maiden was shocked!

Meanwhile, the black robed figure suddenly looked towards the spot where Yang Ye had left from, “That fellow is really quite brave. He actually dared to help the Confucianist Progenitor deliver something. Does he really think no one knew?”

Nether Maiden asked, “Did they not try to stop him?”

“Of course!” The black robed figure said, “He should have died in the Confucianist Dimension!”

Nether Maiden asked, “Then how did he survive?”

The black robed figure gazed at her, “See for yourself!” The black robed figure flipped their right palm.

A screen of light appeared before Nether Maiden, and Yang Ye was in it. Yang Ye was in the Confucianist Dimension.

In the sky above, two old men were looking down at Yang Ye, and one of them was about to attack when Yang Ye was leaving the Confucianist Dimension.

Suddenly, an armless man appeared before the two old men.

The armless man cracked his neck, and then he raised his chin in their direction, “Why don’t you try!”
