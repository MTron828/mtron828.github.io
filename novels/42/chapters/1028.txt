Chapter 1029 – Damnable Heavens!

It didn’t take long for the sound of footsteps to vanish. However, a demon beast which Yang Ye had never seen in his life was standing around 30m away from him.

The demon beast had the appearance of a lion, was the size of an elephant, and was completely dark black. Besides that, it had 2 light gold dragon horns, the beak of a hawk, and a pair of black wings.

There were numerous arm-thick chains coiled all around the demon beast.

Yang Ye’s pupils constricted when he saw the chains. He didn’t know if they were at the Emperor Rank, but they were absolutely not at the Divine Rank!

At this moment, those chains were covered in cracks!

As for the demon beast, it wasn’t just emanating a terrifying pressure and aura, there was an extremely evil aura coming from it as well. That aura caused even Yang Ye’s heart to palpitate, and he couldn’t help but take 2 steps back.

What exactly is that monster? Yang Ye had an extremely solemn expression on his face, and the woman in his arms was in a similar state.

There was a faint blue circle behind the demon beast. Yang Ye knew that it was the teleportation formation, and he just had to enter it to immediately escape this damnable place!

But he didn’t dare act rashly!

“Human!” The ferocious beast suddenly spoke the human tongue, “I sense a very evil aura from you, and it’s extremely dense. I like evil people!”

Yang Ye’s face was dark. You can just say that I’m a bad person. Even though he didn’t like what the demon beast said, he still heaved a huge sigh of relief in his heart. Because that fellow hadn’t immediately charged at him like he’d expected. At a time like this, it was best to avoid fighting if he could!

After all, everyone here was civilized!

Yang Ye thought for a moment and spoke seriously, “Actually, I like evil people and demon beasts as well. I hate those hypocrites who constantly speak about morals and righteousness yet commit evil when no one’s looking. The evil are evil. Why do we have to disguise ourselves? Right?”

The beast asked, “You really like evil demon beasts?”

Yang Ye hurriedly nodded, “Of course!”

The beast said, “Then can you help me do something?”

Yang Ye’s face froze.

The beast continued, “See these damnable iron chains on me? Those hypocrites placed these chains on me all those years ago. Can you help me remove them? I’ll be grateful if you’re willing to help me with it.”

That fellow is trying to trick me!

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly. He knew that he’d underestimated the beast’s intelligence. He hesitated for a moment and replied, “Even though I really want to help you, I’m sure you’ve noticed how weak I am. I can’t break open those chains with my strength.”

If this fellow before him was good, then he wouldn’t mind helping the beast. The problem was that the beast was clearly not good, so help it? He wasn’t tired of living! Moreover, he really wasn’t able to break open those iron chains. After all, he couldn’t utilize the Decay Laws now!

The beast’s fist-sized eyes glowed ferociously, but it returned to normal in an instant, “Human, are you refusing my request?”

Yang Ye placed the woman on his back and said, “That’s not true. Just look at me yourself and see how weak I am. But the chains on you are so strong. So, how could I possibly destroy them? Moreover, even you who are so strong aren’t able to break through them, so it’s impossible for me. Right?” Yang Ye clenched his fists and accumulated strength while he spoke.

“You can’t, but she can!” The ferocious beast’s gaze suddenly descended onto the woman on Yang Ye’s back, “I sense powerful energy within her!”

Yang Ye’s eyelids twitched. He knew that she was very strong, but the problem was that she couldn’t help! He trusted her because she would have used her strength if she could, and she wouldn’t have just allowed him to do what he’d done repeatedly.

“Human! I, Qiong Qi, am not a beast who doesn’t know how to repay his debts. So long as you help me deal with these chains, I’ll definitely repay you!” The demon beast pointed at a distant tree and said, “See that? The fruits from that tree are able to greatly improve your strength, and all its fruits will be yours if you help me remove these chains!”

Yang Ye looked over and saw a golden tree around 300m away. There were numerous fist-sized golden fruits hanging on it, and there were over a 100 of them!”

The woman on Yang Ye’s back spoke abruptly, “Adamantium Fruits!”

Over 100 Adamantium Fruits! Yang Ye felt his heart speed up. Even though these fruits were very harmful to humans, they were a huge help to demon beasts. If he could take them and give them to demon beasts, it would be equivalent to gaining over 100 more Saints!

The ferocious beast who called himself Qiong Qi suddenly said, “See them? They’re all yours if you help me remove these chains!”

However, Yang Ye shook his head. He was tempted, but the woman couldn’t help. Because if she could do anything, she probably would have fought the demon beast a long time ago. Moreover, he didn’t believe Qiong Qi.

Qiong Qi said, “Human! You’re refusing me again!”

Yang Ye glanced at Qiong Qi and said, “Based on your strength, you should be able to struggle free of those chains, so why ask for my help? We aren’t here to act against you. We’re just here to leave this world!”

The ferocious beast fell silent for an instant before it suddenly revealed a fierce gaze and spoke ferociously, “Leave this world? No, no one can leave this world!” As he spoke, he suddenly roared at Yang Ye!

Om! Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

A soundwave tore through space and shot towards Yang Ye. Everywhere it passed, space rippled violently like boiling water, and it was extremely shocking!

Yang Ye revealed a fierce expression as well. Because he’d been on guard, so he’d swiftly launched his fist forward when Qiong Qi roared, and the powerful force his fist carried slammed against the soundwave!

Bang!

The space in the surroundings rippled violently from the impact, and countless strands of energy swept towards the surroundings. Yang Ye was blasted almost 100 steps back by the aftershock, and dense cracks appeared throughout his chest. As for the beast, while it had been struck by the aftershock, it was completely unharmed.

It’s too strong! Yang Ye’s face was extremely solemn. Because he’d almost been unable to resist just a roar from Qiong Qi. So, wouldn’t he be completely obliterated if Qiong Qi could escape those chains?

Now, he had 2 choices. The 1st was to turn around and flee. Of course, he couldn’t go anywhere. At the very most, he just didn’t have to face this ferocious beast for now. But once Qiong Qi struggled free of those chains on his own, it would undoubtedly be the day Yang Ye died.

Yang Ye’s 2nd choice was to seize this opportunity where Qiong Qi hadn’t struggled free of the chains to kill Qiong Qi. Not only would that put an end to the danger he faced, he would even be able to escape.

Unfortunately, based on the current situation, he would be lucky if he wasn’t killed instead!

Roar! Roar!

Qiong Qi suddenly started roaring madly, and the chains around him instantly started to crack as if they would shatter at any moment.

Yang Ye’s eyelids twitched at the sight of this scene, and he ceaselessly slammed his fists forward to resist those soundwaves.

“Hey! Do you have any ideas?” Yang Ye was moving backwards incessantly before those soundwaves. His fists had split open and blood was surging out incessantly from them! If this were to continue, then both of them would definitely die.

Yang Ye had even tried to summon a shadowy figure to attack Qiong Qi, but the shadowy figure’s ripples were blasted into pieces by the soundwaves before it could even come close to Qiong Qi!

This caused Yang Ye’s face to turn absolutely grim, and he quickly ordered the shadowy figure to come back. After all, it would truly be a waste if he were to let those shadowy figures be obliterated here. After all, they would be a huge help to him if he could escape this world!

The woman suddenly spoke in a low voice, “Do you want me to help?”

Yang Ye hurriedly asked, “What would happen if you did?”

She replied, “You’d be the first to die!”

Yang Ye shouted loudly, “Why?”

She answered, “Because you’re the weakest here!”

Yang Ye’s face was absolutely dark, “Can’t you control your strength and avoid killing me?”

She replied, “I could in the outside world, but not here!”

Yang Ye pondered deeply for a short moment and said, “In other words, everyone will die if you act?”

She answered, “Indeed!”

Yang Ye laughed bitterly, “Is there no other way?”

She replied, “There is!”

Yang Ye hastily pursued an answer, “Tell me what it is!”

“That illusory little pagoda of yours!” The woman continued, “I don’t know if it can resist that beast. But perhaps we’ll have a chance if you can control it!”

The Primordial Pagoda!

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly. At this moment, he had no choice but to give it a try!

Yang Ye didn’t dare hesitate. He immediately immersed his consciousness into his body and was about to communicate with the tiny vortex.

Bang!

However, the iron chains on Qiong Qi suddenly exploded apart, and a terrifying aura surged out from within Qiong Qi. The aura instantly swept towards the surroundings!

Bang! Bang! Bang!

In an instant, the mountain walls in the surroundings were blasted apart and transformed into powder!

Everything collapsed before it.

“Damnable barbarians of this world! Damnable heavens! I, Qiong Qi, am free!” Qiong Qi roared towards the sky, and his voice surged through the heavens and the earth. At this moment, the entire world was shaking violently!

Suddenly, his gaze descended onto Yang Ye. He didn’t speak a single word, and he just slapped his claw towards Yang Ye and the woman from afar!

Bang! Bang!

The space before him instantly collapsed, and it collapsed all the way and created numerous black holes which led towards Yang Ye.

A ferocious gaze surged into the woman’s eyes when she witnessed this scene, and she floated up slowly from Yang Ye’s back!

At the same time, a thread of black energy appeared in her eyes!
