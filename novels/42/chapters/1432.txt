Chapter 1433 – Are You An Idiot?

Slap!

Suddenly, a clear slap resounded through the surroundings, and then the young man was blasted away. He flew extremely far away before finally descending to the ground.

Boom!

The ground shook violently and cracked apart.

The two old men who were standing by the young man’s side were stunned.

Yang Ye was quite stunned as well. Because it was none other than the black robed old man who’d struck the young man.

One of the old men gazed at the black robed old man with a puzzled expression, “Elder Hua....”

The black robed old man glanced coldly at the old man who spoke to him, and then he raised his right hand. The young man was instantly brought over in front of him, “Is there something wrong with you in the head?”

The young man was quite stunned, and his eyes were filled with a lost expression.

The black robed old man released the young man and said, “Go home right now and don’t come out for the next three years.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he gazed at the old man who spoke to him just now, “Tell your lord that I was the one who said that.”

“Why?!”The young man stared at Elder Hua. Besides a puzzled expression, there was rage in his eyes. After all, he’d been slapped for no reason, so he was naturally furious. If the black robed old man’s strength wasn’t formidable, he might have even attacked by now.

“Why?” The black robed old man gazed at the young man and said, “If it wasn’t for your grandfather, I wouldn’t have even bothered to care about your fate.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he gazed at the old man again, “Take him and leave right now. Otherwise, I’ll have to help his grandfather teach him a lesson.”

“I refuse to accept this!” Meanwhile, the young man suddenly roared with fury, “Elder Hua, why?! Why would you rather help him than me? Do you still treat my grandfather as a brother of yours?”

Slap!

Another clear slap resounded as the young man’s figure was blasted away once more.

The two old men’s expressions became quite unsightly.

However, Elder Hua paid no attention to them. He gazed at the young man who’d crashed down to the ground in the distance, “You fool! I wouldn’t even have bothered to hit you if it wasn’t because I think of your grandfather as a brother.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he turned to look at Yang Ye, “Young Brother Yang, you won’t make a fuss with these children, right?” Actually, he was terrified when he saw that the young man’s group intended to attack Yang Ye. What a joke! Tear off Yang Ye’s limbs? Did they want to die?

Not to mention the young man, even the forces of the entire Azure Cloud Merchant Group would probably be unable to tear off Yang Ye’s limbs!

Children? Yang Ye glanced at the black robed old man. Needless to say, the old man was very good at defusing the situation. Because if he made a fuss about it, then he would be a child too! It would be beneath him!

Yang Ye grinned and said, “Of course, of course I wouldn’t. However, if he keeps trying to look for trouble with me, then....”

The black robed old man replied, “I guarantee that won’t happen!”

Yang Ye shrugged and remained quiet.

Meanwhile, the other old man by the young man’s side couldn’t help but ask, “Elder Hua, who...?”

“His name is Yang Ye!” As soon as the black robed old man finished speaking, he turned around and gazed at Yang Ye, “Young Brother Yang, the second young miss is done. Let’s go.”

Yang Ye nodded, and then he went with Elder Hua.

Meanwhile, the two old men seemed like they were petrified on the spot, and it didn’t take long for cold sweat to appear on their faces.

Yang Ye!

Yang the Butcher!

Did anyone in the Eastern Territory not know Yang Ye? He was a god of slaughter who’d comprehended Quasi Returnal Rank slaughter intent, and he had the Stellar Sword Diagram which was called the number one treasure in the lower dimensions. It could be said that it wasn’t just two star stellar regions which didn’t dare to offend Yang Ye, even three star stellar regions didn’t dare to offend him!

But they actually intended to tear off his limbs!

At this moment, they were beyond grateful to Elder Hua.

If Elder Hua hadn’t interfered, then all three of them would have died here.

Meanwhile, the young man was stunned on the spot.

Yang Ye!

Only now did he recall that the person who’d struck him in Stellar City was called Yang Ye. However, he hadn’t paid any attention to that name. So, that scene from before had occurred.

Actually, he felt quite fearful right now. Because he was very well aware that if Yang Ye killed him, then his grandfather would definitely not avenge him.

They couldn’t afford to take revenge!

It didn’t take long for their group of three to leave.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye followed Elder Hua into the hall.

There were only three people in the hall. Yang Ye, the black robed old man, and the second young miss who was at the seat of the host.

Yang Ye gazed at the second young miss. She seemed much more heroic than her older sister. Yang Ye didn’t beat around the bust and immediately said, “Second Young Miss, I’m here to meet the eldest young miss. I wonder if you can allow it?”

The second young miss spoke flatly, “Just meet her?”

“Of course not!” Yang Ye smiled, “She helped me yet was confined because of me. I think I have to deal with it. Otherwise, I would be too ungrateful.”

“Deal with it?” A smile curled up on the corners of her mouth, “I wonder how you intend to do that?”

Yang Ye looked her in the eyes, “She’s my friend!”

“So what?” She refused to show any weakness and met his gaze, “She’s a member of my Nangong Clan. She made a mistake, so my clan naturally has the right to punish her.”

Yang Ye shook his head and said, “Her so-called mistake is helping me, right?”

“Yes!” The second young miss continued, “She got swept into the enmity between Wildlands Stellar Region and Clouds of Heaven Stellar Region without obtaining authorization from the merchant group. Her actions have severely harmed our interests, so she should be punished.”

Yang Ye gazed at her for a long time before he replied, “Second Young Miss, I promised her that if she helped me, then she can open branches in the worlds I manage, and I promised not to take any fees for 30 years. Now, my Clouds of Heaven Stellar Region has taken control of a few hundred small worlds. So long as she is released, Azure Cloud Merchant Group can open stores in all those worlds and pay no fees for 30 years.”

A few hundred worlds! She was visibly moved. If Azure Cloud Merchant group opened branches in those worlds, it would obtain massive benefits. Moreover, they would have to pay no fees. She could imagine how much her merchant group would make in those years!

A moment of silence ensued before her expression eased up slightly, “Yang Ye, is that true?”

“Of course!” He looked her in the eyes and said, “However, the only condition is that she must discuss and complete the agreement with my stellar region. My stellar region only acknowledges her!”

The second young miss’s face turned gloomy, “Yang Ye, are you trying to interfere in my merchant group’s business? Aren’t you going a little too far?”

“Too far?” Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly, “Second Young Miss, allow me to be honest. If it wasn’t out of consideration for the fact that you’re related to Miss Nangong Qing, I wouldn’t have wasted my breath on you. Let me just say this. If Nangong Qin manages Azure Cloud Merchant Group, then I’ll treat your merchant group as a very close ally; but if someone else manages it, then I’m sorry. My Clouds of Heaven Stellar Region won’t welcome anyone from Azure Cloud Merchant Group!”

The second young miss’s face became slightly unsightly, “Yang Ye, I admit that you’re very strong, and no one dares to offend you. However, that doesn’t represent that we fear you. If you want to work together with us, then my Nangong Clan welcomes it. However, my Nangong Clan will deal with our own business, and an outsider has no right to make decisions for us!”

Yang Ye nodded, “So, you refuse to let her go?”

She looked him in the eyes and spoke resolutely, “I refuse!”

Yang Ye gazed at her and asked, “Are you sure?”

“Very sure!” As soon as she finished speaking, Yang Ye suddenly vanished on the spot. However, the black robed old man’s figure vanished at the exact same moment, and his speed was actually slightly faster than Yang Ye. He immediately arrived behind Yang Ye. Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly turned around and stabbed his sword forward. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Bang!

An explosion resounded as the old man was blasted out of the hall.

The old man was astounded. He glanced at his palm, and he noticed a thumb-sized hole at the center of it!

The expression on the old man’s face became extremely solemn. He hadn’t expected Yang Ye to be even stronger than he’d imagined. He looked up and saw Yang Ye was already in front of his second young miss, and a sword was pressed against the center of her forehead.

“Bring your Nangong Qin here!” Yang Ye looked her in the eye, “It’s best if you hurry. I’m not someone with a huge amount of patience.”

She stared at him and said, “Yang Ye! This is our clan’s business!”

Yang Ye shook his head and said, “I don’t care about your clan’s business. All I do know is that she helped me when Clouds of Heaven Stellar Region was at its most difficult moment. Now that she’s in trouble, how can I just stand by idly? It’s fine if your Azure Cloud Merchant Group has no place for her, I can take her with me and help her establish an even better merchant group.”

As far as Yang Ye was concerned, he would never forget those who oppressed him. Similarly, he would never forget those who’d helped him!

She just gazed at him in silence.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye said, “I really don’t like to waste my breath, and I don’t want to waste time here. If I don’t see her in 10 breaths of time, then I’ll cut off your head.”

Domineering!

Absolutely domineering!

Suddenly, Yang Ye seemed to have thought of something, and he said, “I heard that you and your older sister are the only successors in your generation?”

The second young miss frowned, “What are you trying to say?!”

Yang Ye replied, “If I killed you, then... only your older sister would remain.”

Her pupils constricted while a trace of terror appeared in her eyes.
