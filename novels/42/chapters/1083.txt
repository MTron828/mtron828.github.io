Chapter 1084 – What A Temper!

After his skin had finished shedding, Yang Ye immediately rushed over because he was afraid that something would happen to An Nanjing and Xuwu Shen.

However, he hadn’t expected someone to attack him as soon as he arrived!

A wisp of ferocity flashed through Yang Ye’s eyes as he gazed at the grey robed old man. Because he was that mysterious old man who’d attacked Yang Ye outside White Deer City that day.

Yang Ye hadn’t forgotten the old man’s aura!

He clenched his right fist and swung it forward!

“Divine Fist of Destruction!”

The grey robed old man’s attack shook violently before exploding into pieces, and Yang Ye took a few dozen steps back!

The pupils of everyone in the surroundings constricted, and it was especially so for the members of White Deer Academy. Because they were very well aware how strong the grey robed old man was. That was exactly why they were shocked!

Wu Yuan and Han Yu exchanged glances, and they saw a trace of shock in each other’s eyes.

As for Lin Yueyin, she was completely dumbstruck. She’d been dumbstruck since the moment she saw Yang Ye. Because she hadn’t imagined that the man who’d humiliated her that day would have actually been Yang Ye who’d come from Pine Prefecture to challenge White Deer Academy! Xiao Yuxi had a trace of shock in her eyes as well. Similarly, she hadn’t expected that this fellow who called her his wife was actually Yang Ye!

The grey robed old man was instantly stunned when he saw his attack being blasted apart, and it didn’t take long for shock to surge into his eyes. Even though he’d merely used less than 30% of his strength because he was shocked, it was still not something that a Half-Saint could resist! It didn’t take long for his shock to transform into undisguised ghastly killing intent.

The grey robed old man was about to attack again. Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly gazed at the Law Faction’s group and said, “Law Faction, do you have any shame? Do you?”

“Honor is something you fight for with the fist!” The grey robed old man grunted coldly and was about to attack.

However, Yang Ye suddenly condensed an intent sword and pointed it at the grey robed old man, “Are you the one who’ll be competing with my Ocean of Clouds Academy today? If you are, then I won’t say anything. Let’s start the battle right now! The heavens will decide which one of us lives!”

“Interesting!” Wu Yuan had a grin on the corners of his mouth, “What a temper!”

Han Yu added, “He really does have a fiery temper. I just wonder what his strength is like!”

Wu Yuan’s gaze descended onto the grey robed old man, “I’d like to know how thick Luo Sen’s skin is!”

The grey robed old man called Luo Sen had an extremely gloomy expression on his face. He would naturally not say that he was the one who would be competing with Ocean of Clouds Academy, and it was impossible for him to compete with Yang Ye. What a joke! He was the dignified head elder of the Law Faction. Regardless of whether he won or loss, the world would ridicule him for fighting a Half-Saint in single combat.

Luo Sen stared fixedly at Yang Ye for a short while, and then he said, “The reason I attack was because you cheated in my White Deer Academy. Such actions are an insult to my White Deer Academy, and it truly deserves death!”

“I cheated?” Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly, “I don’t understand what you’re saying!”

“You still intend to keep that act up?” Luo Sen roared furiously, “Let me ask you a question! Did you come up through that stone stairway?”

Yang Ye replied, “Didn’t you see that for yourself?”

Luo Sen questioned, “Then why were you able to reach the peak in such a short amount of time?”

Yang Ye frowned. He still didn’t understand what Luo Sen was talking about. Meanwhile, Xuwu Shen walked over to him and explained about the stone stairway.

As soon as he finished speaking, Xuwu Shen moved closed to Yang Ye and spoke softly, “Did you really not cheat?”

Yang Ye immediately came to an understanding once he finished listening to Xuwu Shen. He disregarded Xuwu Shen’s question, gazed at Luo Shen, and chuckled, “So the time it took me was too short, so you say that I cheated?”

Yang Ye suddenly laughed coldly when he spoke up to this point, “How laughable! Not only are the students of your Law Faction useless and take more than 100 breaths of time to ascend those stairs, you can’t even stand the sight of others being quicker! Do you have no shame?”

“How presumptuous! You....” Luo Sen roared furiously. He was just about to say something when Yang Ye suddenly interrupted him and shouted with fury, “You’re the one who’s being presumptuous. Since you think I cheated, why don’t I do it again while all of you watch? If I didn’t cheat, then you have to admit that your Law Faction is useless before everyone! Do you dare? If I cheated, then I’ll take my own life! Do you dare or not?”

Luo Sen’s face was unsightly to the extreme while terrifying killing intent arose around him.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings and said, “My Ocean of Clouds Academy is only a minor power. In the end, we’re still part of White Deer Academy, and Dean Shang’s lifelong dream was to lead Ocean of Cloud Academy’s students back to White Deer Academy. However, the Law Faction refused to allow it, and it even repeatedly sent experts to deal with us in Pine Prefecture. For the sake of protecting the academy, Dean Shang was even forced to detonate himself and take the Law Faction’s experts down with him!”

Yang Ye paused for a moment at this point, and then he continued, “Fine. It was because we are weak, and it isn’t your fault. Now, I’ve come here as agreed on behalf of Ocean of Clouds Academy. If I, Yang Ye, lost in a fair fight and was killed, I wouldn’t resent you at all. However, your Law Faction hasn’t fought me fairly, and it has been constantly using devious methods to try and kill me. Allow me to tell you that I look down on such actions! I look down on all of you!”

His voice rumbled like a thunderclap and resounded through the sky! Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

The members of the Law Faction were exasperated when they heard Yang Ye, and one of their students leaped forward and arrived in front of Yang Ye, “Yang Ye, didn’t you want a fair fight? I’ll have a fair fight with you....”

He was about to attack while he spoke, but a figure suddenly appeared in front of him before he could even attack. After that, he felt extreme pain come from his stomach while blood sprayed from his mouth, and his figure was blasted flying. In the end, he crashed to the ground, and his figure twitched for a while before going completely still.

He’s been killed in an instant!

“How dare you!” Luo Sen was livid, and he was about to attack again.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly chuckled, “See? When the young fail, the old will act. Law Faction, are you good for anything? Are you?”

“Allow me to say something!” Suddenly, the white robed old man who led the group from the Scholarly Faction suddenly stood up and broke his silence. He sized up Yang Ye and nodded slightly to Yang Ye before he gazed at Luo Sen, “Brother Luo, I’m sure you’re very well aware if that child cheated earlier, and everyone here knows it very well as well. Why continue putting on a scene like a clown?”

Luo Sen laughed coldly, and then he gazed at Yang Ye and said, “I just wanted to provide him with some guidance because he seemed not bad. Unfortunately, he didn’t appreciate my kindness.”

“That old fellow is even more thick skinned than you!” Xuwu Shen puckered his lips while disdain filled his eyes.

The white robed old man nodded, “So that’s why. I knew you, Luo Sen, were no thick skinned and shameless person, so how could you have possibly tried to bully the young?”

Luo Sen’s face twitched, and he glanced coldly at the white robed old man before he said, “Yun Xing’zi, stop being sarcastic. Didn’t he want a fair fight? Alright, I’ll give him a fair fight. Otherwise, he’ll think that my Law Faction has no one capable.”

He gazed at Yang Ye at this point and said, “Yang Ye, since you’ve come to participate in my White Deer Academy’s competition, then you have to act according to the rules of my White Deer Academy. You have no problem with that, right?”

“Of course not!” Yang Ye smiled, “In any case, I’ve already seen you act shamelessly and bully someone younger like me, so it doesn’t matter if you act even more shamelessly after this.”

Luo Sen laughed coldly, “According to the rules of my academy, the 1st round is an elimination round, and it’ll continue until one side is annihilated or admits defeat! Do you have any problem with that?”

Yang Ye replied, “None!”

Luo Sen continued, “Since you have no problem, then let’s begin!”

As soon as he spoke, he waved his right hand, and then 10 figures suddenly appeared in the arena. There were 8 men and 2 women amongst them!

All of them were Saints!

10 Saints!

“How shameless!” Xuwu Shen instantly started cursing. They only had 3 on their side, and all of them were Half-Saints. But the Law Faction had sent out 10 students, and all of them were Saints. So they were clearly intending to act shamelessly.

“Shameless?” Luo Sen laughed coldly, “Your Ocean of Clouds Academy is weak, and so are the 3 of you. Is that our fault?”

Yang Ye glanced at those Saints. Their auras were deep like an ocean. He had no doubt that they were no ordinary Saints. But it was obvious because the Law Faction was aware of his and An Nanjing’s strength, so how could they possibly send weaklings to give their lives away? The Law Faction clearly intended to annihilate them in this round of the competition!

Yang Ye glanced at the old man from the Scholarly Faction, and the latter remained silent.

Luo Sen grinned, “Yang Ye, it’s fine if you’re afraid. Our Law Faction isn’t heartless. You just have to kneel below the arena, kowtow, and admit your mistakes to our Law Faction, then we’ll allow you to live. Alright?”

“There’s no need to egg me on.” Yang Ye continued, “Since you’re so desperate to kill us, then bring it on!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye flashed up into the arena. At the same time, An Nanjing and Xuwu Shen followed closely behind him.

“Good!” Luo Sen laughed coldly, “Yang Ye, you’re brave! Don’t worry, we’ll keep your corpse intact.”

“What’s with all the crap?” Yang Ye looked Luo Sen in the eyes, “Stop wasting time, alright?”

Fury surged onto Luo Sen’s face as he said, “Since you’re in such a rush to die, I’ll fulfil your wish!” As soon as he finished speaking, Luo Sen waved his right hand, and a ray of dazzling white light erupted on the arena. The white light was like a barrier that covered the arena.

At the same time, Yang Ye and the others’ fields of vision warped, and it didn’t take long for them to appear on a desolate plain.

“It’s a pocket of space used as a battlefield!” Xuwu Shen spoke solemnly, “But we’re still in the arena, and the others outside can still watch what’s going on in here. There’s a special formation covering the arena! So....”

Xuwu Shen hadn’t even finished speaking when the 10 Saints before them had started charging towards them!

“Let’s fight!” As soon as he finished speaking, he vanished on the spot with An Nanjing.
