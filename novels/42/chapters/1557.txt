Chapter 1558 - Not In This World Anymore!

Translator: InVader

Little Sky shook her head. She knew that it was impossible to end this peacefully now.

Yang Ye placed his trembling hands on the cage, and he gazed at Snowy for a long time before he said, “Snowy, I know that you hate being caged up. I’m sorry. I’m really sorry that I wasn’t able to protect you well. I’m truly sorry. From today onward, I won’t allow us to be separated again.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he issued a command in his heart, and then Snowy was instantly taken into the Primordial Pagoda.

“How dare you!” Suddenly, a furious howl resounded, and then an old man in a red robe appeared not too far away from Yang Ye and Little Sky.

The old man stared at Yang Ye and Little Sky. He hadn’t expected that someone would actually be able to sneak in here.

Yang Ye turned to look at the old man. At this moment, his eyes were blood red. His desire to kill was at its peak, so his slaughter intent had completely suppressed his sword intent.

Little Sky glanced at Yang Ye and remained silent.

The old man frowned when he saw Yang Ye. A moment of silence ensued before ghastly killing intent flashed through the old man’s eyes, “You’re not from the Goat Clan! You’re a human!”

Yang Ye walked slowly in the old man’s direction, “Where’s Snowy’s consciousness?”

Suddenly, Little Sky spoke, “Hand over the Sprite Lord’s consciousness and we’ll leave!”

The old man’s eyes narrowed slightly, “How do you know about that?!”

Yang Ye flipped his palm and the Sword Precursor appeared in his grasp. Meanwhile, Little Sky hurriedly grabbed Yang Ye’s hand and gazed at the red robed old man, “The Divine Phoenix Clan imprisoned the Sprite Lord of this world, such actions harm the balance of the world. Quickly hand over her consciousness or your Divine Phoenix Clan will be in danger.”

“Danger?” The old man laughed coldly, “With just your strength? How laughable!” As he spoke, he gazed at Yang Ye, “I don’t care how you go in here. Since you know something that you shouldn’t, then die!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he slapped his right palm at Yang Ye.

The Sprite Lord!

It was the Divine Phoenix Clan’s biggest secret, and they absolutely couldn’t allow others to find out about it.

Little Sky stamped her feet with anger when she saw him attack, “Dammit! I’m not going to interfere anymore.” She moved behind Yang Ye as she spoke.

Om!

Suddenly, a sword howl resounded, and then a beam of sword energy flashed. It was extremely swift and instantly arrived before the old man.

Bang!

An explosion resounded, and the sword energy vanished. As for the old man, he was pushed over 50m back.

The old man was shocked. He was about to speak when a wave of terrifying sword intent suddenly surged out from Yang Ye. As soon as the sword intent appeared, the lava in the surroundings were obliterated!

The old man’s pupils constricted, “Returnal Rank sword intent! Who are you?!”

Yang Ye didn’t waste his breath. The Sword Precursor vanished from his grasp.

The old man’s expression changed drastically when he saw Yang Ye’s sword vanish, and then a wave of fire surged out from him.

Bang!

A loud explosion resounded while the old man was blasted backwards repeatedly. At the same time, an extremely terrifying wave of energy erupted from the point of collision. In an instant, the lava throughout the area started to surge violently.

Boom!

A moment of silence later, the lava rumbled abruptly, and then the underground area collapsed.

We’re under attack? The entire Divine Phoenix Clan was shocked!

Ten breaths of time later. On the surface.

At this moment, countless phoenixes were rushing over from all directions.

Yang Ye stood there with his sword in hand. At this moment, he was completely blood red, and Little Sky was standing behind him. If it was in the past, she would have gone into the Primordial Pagoda by now. However, for some reason, she hadn’t done so this time. But Yang Ye couldn’t be bothered about that right now.

The experts of the Divine Phoenix Clan were rushing over incessantly. It wasn’t just them, even Gu Mo and the others had rushed over too. All three of them were stunned when they saw Yang Ye.

Ku Yuan was astounded, “That’s… that’s Xiao Yang?”

At this moment, while Yang Ye’s face still looked the same, he wasn’t just completely blood red, there was monstrous slaughter intent surging from him. It was completely different from the Xiao Yang they knew.

Yan Lingxue gazed at Yang Ye for a long time and said, “You really are human!” Actually, she’s suspected he was human since the battle she fought with him. However, she wasn’t very sure. Yet now, the facts before her told her that her suspicions were true.

He was a human!

Ku Yuan was stunned for a moment, and then he felt shocked. At this moment, he realized that Yang Ye was holding a sword and emanating slaughter intent. Besides that, spirit energy was fluctuating throughout Yang Ye’s body! RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

A human!

Ku Yuan’s eyes were filled with disbelief. He hadn’t expected Yang Ye to be a human. After all, a human actually possessed such powerful physical strength.

Meanwhile, a red haired middle aged man arrived here. The middle aged man’s face was quite similar to Mo Xiaoleng’s, and he was the Divine Phoenix Clan’s patriarch, Mo Jiang.

The middle aged man glanced indifferently at Yang Ye and Little Sky, and then he gazed at Gu Mo, “Gu Mo, the first in the Meeting of the Clans is actually a human, but you still brought a human to the Hallowed Grounds of my Divine Phoenix Clan. Elder Gu, don’t you have to give me an explanation?”

Gu Mo remained silent for a long time, and then he said, “I didn’t expect him to be a human either!”

He was avoiding any responsibility for this!

At this moment, he naturally had to do this. If he admitted to being aware that Yang Ye was a human, then Demon God’s Palace would definitely be in huge trouble.

Mo Jiang glanced at Gu Mo, and then he turned to look at Yang Ye, “A mere Deity like you dared to enter deep into the restricted areas of my Divine Phoenix Clan. Needless to say, you’re really brave. You…”

Yang Ye interrupted Mo Jiang and asked, “Where’s Snowy’s consciousness?”

Mo Jiang frowned. It didn’t take long for him to understand what Yang Ye was talking about. He fell silent for a moment, and then he gazed at Gu Mo, “Elder Gu, my Divine Phoenix Clan knows him, and there’s some enmity between us, so we’ll deal with him ourselves. So, please leave for now. The Hallowed Grounds will be open to you again once he's dealt with.”

He naturally couldn’t allow others to find out about the Sprite Lord. Otherwise, the Divine Phoenix Clan would have endless future troubles!

Gu Mo fell silent for a long time, and then he walked over to Yang Ye and asked, “Why?”

He was asking why Yang Ye had exposed himself.

Yang Ye shook his head, “Elder Gu, he’s not wrong. There’s some enmity between us, so let us deal with it ourselves.”

Gu Mo sighed softly. The Demon God thought highly of Yang Ye, so Yang Ye’s future could be said to be limitless. Yet now… If he left, then he knew what would happen to Yang Ye. However, he couldn’t help Yang Ye because if he did, then it represented that the Demon God’s Palace was going to become enemies with the Divine Phoenix Clan.”

The demon race would never engage in internal strife, and it wouldn’t engage in internal strife for a human!

Gu Mo shook his head and asked, “What’s your name?”

“Yang Ye!” Yang Ye didn’t conceal his identity because there was no reason to.

Yang Ye!

Everyone here was stunned when they heard this name!

Yang Ye!

This name wasn’t unknown in the large world. He’d killed his way up here from the lower dimensions, and he’d even killed five Rebirth Realm experts to do so.

Of course, there was one more reason, and it was Mo Xiaoleng. The entire demon race was aware that Mo Xiaoleng had been getting people to go kill Yang Ye.

“I never expected this! I truly didn’t expect this!” Gu Mo shook his head, and then he gazed at Yan Lingxue and Ku Yuan, “Let’s go!” As soon as he finished speaking, he waved his hand and vanished on the spot with them.

“I didn’t expect it either!” Meanwhile, Mo Jiang said, “I never expected you to actually come to my Divine Phoenix Clan.”

Yang Ye slowly closed his eyes, “Snowy’s consciousness and Zi’er. I want to see them.” This was the reason why he still hadn’t attacked.

Meanwhile, Little Sky added, “You from the Divine Phoenix Clan, hand over the Sprite Lord’s consciousness. It wasn’t easy for your Divine Phoenix Clan to develop to such an extent, so why…”

Mo Jiang suddenly gazed at Little Sky and interrupted her, “And who are you?”

Little Sky replied, “Little Sky. The little from Little Sky, and the sky from Little Sky!”

Mo Jiang’s eyes narrowed, “Are you kidding me?”

Little Sky was about to speak when Yang Ye waved his hand, and then he gazed at Mo Jiang, “I don’t want to waste more time. Snowy’s consciousness and Zi’er! I want to see them!”

“You can’t!” Mo Jiang looked Yang Ye in the eyes, “They aren’t in this world anymore!”

Yang Ye slowly clenched his right hand. He remained silent for a long time, and then he suddenly looked up at Mo jiang, “Then I’ll bury your entire clan with them!”

Mo Jiang laughed coldly, “You?”

Yang Ye took a deep breath, and then he waved his right hand. The Stellar Sword Diagram appeared in front of him, and then the scene here changed. In an instant, the surroundings had transformed into a starry sky.

In the starry sky, Yang Ye waved his right hand again, and the Sword Precursor appeared far away in the distance while the Sword Domain expanded. A moment later, countless strands of stellar sword energy traveled through space from away in space, and they descended incessantly towards the Phoenix Domain.

At this moment, the entire Demon Territory was shocked!

It wasn’t just the Demon Territory, even the entire continent was shocked!
