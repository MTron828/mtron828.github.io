Chapter 1516 - Wait For Me!

Translator: InVader

After he left the Martial Sect, Yang Ye returned to Clouds of Heaven Stellar Region.

Wargod Hall.

There were only three people in the hall. Yang Ye, Zhuang Weiran, and Ye Liuyun.

Zhuang Weiran asked, “You’re going to the large world?”

Yang Ye nodded, “Soon.”

He gazed at Ye Liuyun and continued, “Have you gathered the information about the Heavenpath?”

Ye Liuyun nodded slightly and said, “If you want to travel through the Heavenpath, you must get to the end of the sky. It’s situated in the sky far in the north. The cultivators of the lower dimensions can travel through the Heavenpath to get to the large world, and it’s the only path to get to the large world from the lower dimensions.”

Yang Ye nodded, “How many are usually guarding it?”

Ye Liuyun pondered deeply for a while and said, “Normally, there’s only a single Dualism Realm expert there! I’m sure you’re aware that Deities can’t rival Dualism Realm experts at all. Coupled with the fact that very few dare to challenge the rules set by the large world, so a single Dualism Realm expert is sufficient to guard the Heavenpath. However…”

She gazed at Yang Ye, “But that’s only under normal circumstances. I’m sure you’re aware that the people up there know you’re coming. So, it’s impossible for them to send just a single Dualism Realm expert, and they may even dispatch experts who surpass the Dualism Realm. They definitely intend to eliminate you without giving you any chances!”

Yang Ye fell silent.

Just as Ye Liuyun had said, since those powers in the large world were aware of his strength, they would definitely not send their forces to feed Yang Ye with experience. They would definitely dispatch a formidable force against him or even a few Rebirth Realm experts.

The Rebirth Realm! DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

It was a realm of cultivation that he couldn’t resist right now!

Meanwhile, Ye Liuyun walked over to Yang Ye and spoke solemnly, “You’re not the same as Jian Wuji or the Unfettered One. The large world’s forces didn’t target them intentionally when they went up through the Heavenpath. But those powers in the large world are targeting you, and they won’t give you any chances. So, I suggest that you don’t go, at least for now!”

Yang Ye slowly clenched his right fist while a slightly gloomy expression appeared on his face. Just as Ye Liuyun had said, he wasn’t like Jian Wuji and the Unfettered One. The large world hadn’t targeted them specifically when they tried to ascend into the large world, and they were already up there when the powers of the large world finally decided to stop them. Yet now, while it wasn’t all the powers in the large world that were targeting him, but at the very least, the Ma Clan, the Emperor Sect, and the War Pavilion would be trying to stop him!

Besides them, there was the Divine Phoenix Clan as well!

Mo Xiaoleng would definitely not let live!

So, if he wanted to ascend into the large world, it was absolutely difficult to accomplish!

Or it should be said that if it was based on the current circumstances, then he would be courting death by trying to head up into the large world!

Yang Ye remained silent for a long time before he spoke, “I have to go!”

“Why?” Ye Liuyun was puzzled. This time, she really didn’t understand Yang Ye’s thoughts. Yang Ye was very impulsive on many occasions, but even when he acted impulsively, he still gave it sufficient thought. Yet now, he was clearly aware that they would be lying in ambush for him, but he still insisted on going. She was puzzled! Extremely puzzled!

Yang Ye took a deep breath and said, “Liuyun, I know that you’re worried, but just think about it. If I can’t go now, then when can I go?”

Ye Liuyun fell silent.

Yang Ye shook his head and said, “Some powers in the large world are targeting me, so I can’t go up there now, and I can’t go up there in the future. Unless I attain the Dualism Realm or Rebirth Realm. Only then would I be able to swagger up there. But regardless of whether it’s the Dualism Realm or Rebirth Realm, they aren’t realms of cultivation that I can attain right now. Moreover, even if I attain the Dualism Realm or Rebirth Realm, I would still be in a similar situation. Now I’m a Semi-Deity, so they may only send Dualism Realm experts. Even if they send Rebirth Realm experts, there won’t be too many of them. But if I’m at the Dualism Realm, then they may send all their experts to kill me! So, the situation I would be in would actually not be much different!”

Ye Liuyun remained silent for a long time, and then she laughed bitterly, “But you have no chance if you go now!”

“You never know until you try!” Yang Ye smiled, and then he gazed at Zhuang Weiran, “There’s no need to worry. I won’t try to court death!”

Zhuang Weiran shook her head slightly, “You will!”

Yang Ye’s face froze. She doesn’t even give me a bit of face…

Meanwhile, Zhuang Weiran walked over to him and took his hand, “I’ve heard about Zi’er, and I know about everything between both of you. I know you won’t abandon her, but you must remember that there’ll only be hope for her and all of us while you’re alive. Understand?”

Yang Ye nodded. He was about to speak when Zhuang Weiran continued, “You’ve offended too many powers, and they aren’t powers that we can resist. So, if you die, it represents that we’ll die with you. Thus, you have to stay alive no matter what. Understand?”

Zhuang Weiran knew Yang Ye’s character very well. He wasn’t afraid of death, nor was he afraid of danger. However, he was afraid that they would die, and he was afraid that they would be in danger! He wouldn’t allow them to fall into a dangerous or hopeless situation. Even though it was a form of restraint to him, it was a form of motivation as well.

“Weiran is right!” Meanwhile, Ye Liuyun chimed in, “Yang Ye, you must realize that you’ve offended too many. If you’re gone, then even if we exclude the large world, there are many people in the lower dimensions that would act against us. So, me, Weiran, or even Zi’er… All of us can die, but you can’t die. Because if you do, then it represents that all of his might die. Presently, you’re the Sword Alliance and Clouds of Heaven Stellar Region’s only hope!”

Yang Ye shook his head, “That makes me feel like a huge amount of pressure is weighing down upon me!”

Ye Liuyun chuckled, “Pressure is motivation! Alright, let’s not talk about that anymore. Since you’re going up there, then you definitely have some other trump card. I believe that you won’t just give your life away.”

She gazed at Zhuang Weiran and continued, “Weiran, you don’t have to be too worried. That fellow seems quite impulsive sometimes, but he’s actually really smart!”

Zhuang Weiran glanced at Yang Ye and nodded, “Indeed!”

She paused for a moment and continued, “Remember what I told you when you went to the Ominous Territory?”

Yang Ye was stunned, “You said something? What?”

Zhuang Weiran glanced indifferently at him, “Since you’ve forgotten, then forget it!”

Yang Ye suddenly wrapped his arm around her waist and smiled, “How could I have forgotten? You said that I should marry you once I get back!” As he spoke, he gazed at Ye Liuyun and continued, “Liuyun, I’ll leave this to you!”

Zhuang Weiran added, “Don’t make it too flashy. A simple one will do.”

“Actually, it’s almost the same!” Ye Liuyun smiled, “Presently, everyone knows about your relationship. However, the ceremony still has to be completed. Because only then will the residents of Clouds of Heaven Stellar Region be able to rest at ease.”

Even though everyone was well aware of the relationship between Yang Ye and Zhuang Weiran, they still hadn’t gotten married, so the residents of Clouds of Heaven Stellar Region wouldn’t be able to rest at ease. They naturally had to worry. Because if Yang Ye and Zhuang Weiran didn’t get together in the end, then what would their stellar region do? Who did Clouds of Heaven Stellar Region rely on to attain its current accomplishments? It was mainly Yang Ye!

If Yang Ye left Clouds of Heaven Stellar Region, then its power and prestige would drop by half, at least!

Conversely, once Yang Ye and Zhuang Weiran were married, they could rest at ease!

It could be considered as strengthening the morale of their forces!

Ye Liuyun was naturally the person who managed the entire ceremony. Just as Zhuang Weiran had asked for, the ceremony wasn’t flashy, and it should be described to be quite simple. It was merely attended by Zhuang Weiran’s parents and some of the higher-ups from both the Sword Alliance and Clouds of Heaven Stellar Region.

Once they watched Yang Ye and Zhuang Weiran being united in marriage, Zhuang Weitian and his wife could finally rest at ease. They naturally supported the union between Yang Ye and their daughter. After all, who was Yang Ye? He was the number one genius in the lower dimensions! It was even to the extent that some considered him the number one expert in the lower dimensions!

But how old was he?

Yang Ye wasn’t even 30!

Even if it was Jian Wuji and the Unfettered One, their accomplishments at his age weren’t any better!

Night.

After everything was done, Yang Ye and Zhuang Weiran left Wargod Hall.

In their room.

The room was surrounded by sword intent and slaughter intent. It could be said that even the divine sense of a Dualism Realm expert would be absolutely unable to enter the room without alarming Yang Ye.

Yang Ye and Zhuang Weiran were wearing their bright red wedding robes.

Zhuang Weiran was a gorgeous beauty. Coupled with the fact that she’d dressed up specially for the occasion, even Yang Ye was quite stunned by her beauty.

Zhuang Weiran spoke softly, “I never imagined that I would get married one day!”

Yang Ye took her hand and said, “That’s because you never met me!”

She glanced at him, “Remember the scene on that day when we met each other on Immortal Island?”

“Of course!” Yang Ye smiled. He naturally remembered that she wasn’t wearing anything when they met.

She asked, “Do you know what ran through my mind at that moment?”

Yang Ye was quite curious, “What?”

She replied, “That I have to kill you!”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

She spoke softly, “Because you saw something that you shouldn’t have!”

Yang Ye put his arm around her waist and smiled, “I shouldn’t have seen it then. Yet now, I can admire all of it.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye waved his right hand, and the room went dark.

After that, soft moans started rising and falling in the room…
