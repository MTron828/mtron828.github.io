Chapter 1670 - If Lightning Doesn’t Strike You, I Will!

Translator: InVader

Yang Ru’s face was utterly gloomy.

He’d only shown himself after he saw Yang Ye kill Yang Xing, but he hadn’t expected that Yang Ye had merely destroyed Yang Xing’s body and had preserved Yang Xing’s soul. So long as Yang Xing’s soul was still alive, he wasn’t dead!

Because it was absolutely easy for the Yang Clan to help Yang Xing rebuild his body!

Since Yang Xing wasn’t dead, his plans to make Yang Xing’s side fight Yang Ye’s side was completely crushed. Moreover, his past ally, Yang Xing, would definitely hate him to the bone now.

He’d absolutely suffered a double loss!

Yang Ru stared at Yang Ye for a long time, and then he nodded slightly and smiled, “They say you’re all brawn and no brains, and you act based on your character. Looks like we’re all mistaken. Tenth Brother Ye, you seem rash on the outside, but you’re sharp on the inside!”

Yang Ye spoke indifferently, “I just don’t want to be used!”

He did want to kill Yang Xing, but he was no fool. If he killed Yang Xing, he was certain that Yang Xing’s family and supporters would definitely become determined to kill him. While he wasn’t afraid of that, it wasn’t necessary to do something that stupid.

So long as he didn’t kill Yang Xing, he had no doubt that Yang Xing would take revenge on Yang Ru. He was naturally willing to watch them fight each other!

However, he didn’t want Yang Xing to get off that easily, so he’d destroyed Yang Xing’s body.

Yang Xing gazed coldly at Yang Ru, “Fourth Brother, how scheming of you. Your chain of traps was amazing!”

Yang Ru grinned, “Now that it has come to this, there’s no point in saying anything. Seventh Brother, feel free to throw anything you have at me. I’ll just deal with it.”

As he spoke, he gazed at Lu Lige, “Kill him!”

As soon as he heard Yang Ru, Lu Yuanzhan clenched his right fist and slammed it at Lu Lige.

Suddenly, Yang Ye transformed into a ray of light that shot towards Lu Yuanzhan. However, a folding fan that was covered in white light suddenly appeared behind Yang Ye. Everywhere it passed, space was instantly torn apart and sliced into bits!

Yang Ye’s face fell when he sensed the folding fan that was approaching him from behind. He paid no attention to it because if he tried to stop it, then Lu Lige would definitely die.

Lu Yuanzhan was instantly blasted backwards from the collision, but Yang Ru’s folding fan slammed against Yang Ye’s back.

Boom!

An explosion resounded, and Yang Ye was blasted away. But it only took an instant for Yang Ye to arrive before Lu Lige, and then he stretched out a finger and a ray of sword energy severed the ropes that bound Lu Lige. After that, two Blood Puppets grabbed Lu Lige!

As soon as Yang Ye finished doing that, a ray of white light instantly arrived before him.

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly. He turned around and swung his sword.

Bang!

A loud explosion resounded and Yang Ye was blasted 3km away. As soon as he stopped himself, Yang Ru had transformed into a ray of white light that vanished on the spot, and he was in front of Yang Ye when he appeared again. After that, his folding fan was suddenly spread open, and then a terrifying wave of force instantly surged out from it.

Bang!

Yang Ye hadn’t even been able to react before he was blasted another 3km back. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Yang Ru was about to attack again. However, a silver spear suddenly descended from the sky. He immediately stopped and looked up at it, and then he pressed together the index and middle fingers on his left hand before tapping the tip of the silver spear.

Om!

The silver spear shook violently before being instantly blasted away. But it didn’t take long for a hand to catch the silver spear. It was Ming Mo.

As soon as he caught the silver spear, his arm started trembling violently, and then his body was pushed almost 30m back!

Once he stopped himself, Ming Mo looked down at his hand which had cracked open, and then he looked down at Yang Ru. His eyes were filled with a solemn expression.

After he pushed Ming Mo back, Yang Ru turned to look at Yang Ye, and then he said something under his breath. After that, his figure transformed into a ray of white light that appeared before Yang Ye!

As soon as he arrived in front of Yang Ye, the space behind him collapsed and formed a large black river.

Yang Ye’s pupils constricted slightly. He sheathed his sword, and then drew it!

16 overlapped Heavenrends!

Heavenrends that were enhanced by Zenith Rank slaughter intent and Returnal Rank sword intent!

The space around Yang Ye instantly collapsed before his attack!

Bang!

A moment later, an explosion resounded, and Yang Ye’s sword energy was dispersed while his figure was pushed 3km back again.

Yang Ru was about to attack again, but An Nanjing appeared before him, and then Skysplit shot towards him.

Yang Ru’s eyes narrowed slightly, and then he stretched out his left palm. He pressed his left palm directly against the tip of Skysplit. As soon as they collided, Skysplit shook violently, and then it instantly bent into the shape of a bow!

An Nanjing’s pupils constricted at the sight of this. Meanwhile, Yang Ru suddenly pushed his left hand forward.

Bang!

An Nanjing was pushed over 1km away!

Everyone here was shocked by this!

Even Yang Ye, An Nanjing, and Yang Xing. No one had expected Yang Ru to actually be so strong. No, he wasn’t just strong, he was terrifying!

Yang Ru glanced at Yang Ye and An Nanjing, and then he glanced at Ming Mo and Yang Xing, “All of you are quite weak!”

Quite weak!

An Nanjing’s eyes narrowed slightly and was about to attack. However, someone was faster than her. It was Ming Mo.

As soon as Yang Ru had finished speaking, he’d transformed into a ray of light that vanished on the spot.

Yang Ru laughed coldly, and then he took a step forward and tapped forward with a single finger.

A wisp of faint white light was coiled around his finger.

Yang Ru’s finger tapped against the tip of Ming Mo’s spear again.

Crack!

As soon as they came into contact, Ming Mo’s silver spear cracked apart.

Bang!

A moment of silence ensued, and then the silver spear exploded apart while Ming Mo’s figure was blasted around a kilometer away. His figure had just stopped moving when Yang Ru appeared in front of him, and then Yang Ru’s folding fan swept towards Ming Mo!

Even though Ming Mo was shocked in his heart, his face was extremely calm. A person like him was very well aware about how important one’s mental state was in battle. If his mental state was shaky, then it was obvious that he’d lost half the battle before it even began.

So, while he was shocked by Yang Ru’s strength, he remained extremely calm.

At the moment Yang Ru’s folding fan swept towards him, he used his hand like a spear and slammed it towards.

Ming Mo’s expression changed drastically when his hand came into contact with Yang Ru’s folding fan.

Hiss!

An instant later, Ming Mo’s right palm flew off into the air. At the same time, Yang Ru suddenly pressed forward and slapped his palm against Ming Mo’s chest.

Bang!

An explosion resounded, and Ming Mo was blasted 3km away, and he spat out numerous mouthfuls of blood once he stopped himself.

Suddenly, Yang Ru tapped his right foot down and vanished on the spot.

At the same time, a wisp of ferocity flashed through Ming MO’s eyes. He flipped his left palm and a spear appeared in his grasp.

Bang!

Once the spear appeared in his grasp, a wave of terrifying intent swept out from him!

Zenith Rank spear intent!

Ming Mo immediately stomped his right foot down and transformed into a ray of spear energy that vanished on the spot.

“Spear Union!” An Nanjing spoke solemnly, “The perfect fusion of man and spear! It’s very powerful!”

Yang Ye nodded slightly, and then he looked off into the distance.

At the exact same moment that Ming Mo had vanished, Yang Ru had suddenly stopped moving, and then he formed a strange seal before his chest. In an instant, a fist-sized ‘文’ character flashed out from between his palms.

It didn’t take long for that ‘文’ character to slam against Ming Mo’s attack.

Boom!

As soon as they collided, a rumbling explosion resounded, and then the space in a huge area cracked apart. At the same time, Ming Mo was blasted away, and he flew for almost 10km before he was finally able to stop himself!

Once his figure stopped, Ming Mo had to support himself up with one of his knees while a string of scarlet red seeped out from the corner of his mouth. In a short moment, his entire chest was dyed red.

He’d lost!

The 10th on the Milky Way Rankings, Ming Mo, had lost!

Yang Ru glanced at his palm, the center of it had cracked open. He fell silent for a moment before he looked up at Ming Mo, “The 10th on the Milky Way Rankings. You almost brought shame to the rankings.”

Ming Mo wiped off the blood on the corner of his mouth, and then he gazed at Yang Ru, “You’re an Ancient Inheritor!”

An Ancient Inheritor!

Everyone here was shocked when they heard Ming Mo, and this included Yang Xing.

What was an Ancient Inheritor?

An Ancient Inheritor was someone who’d obtained the inheritance of an ancient cultivator. Such people were called Ancient Inheritors!

Yang Ru chuckled and glanced at both Yang Ye and Yang Xing, “Besides that mysterious eldest sister of ours, our eldest brother, and that sickly ninth brother of ours, I really don’t take any of the others seriously.”

He gazed at Yang Ye at this point and added, “Including you!”

Suddenly, Yang Ye closed his eyes, and then his soul flashed out from his body. After that, his soul transformed into a ray of light that vanished on the spot.

The soul version of the Sword of Rebirth!

At the moment Yang Ye’s figure vanished, Yang Ru’s expression had changed, and he swiftly unfolded the fan in his grasp.

Bang!

An explosion resounded, and Yang Ru was blasted over 6km away. As soon as he stopped himself, the folding fan in his grasp cracked apart and transformed into bits that drifted off with the wind.

At the same time, a wisp of scarlet red seeped out from the corner of his mouth!

Yang Ye pointed his sword towards the ground at an angle, and then he looked at Yang Ru, “Go on! Continue that show of yours! If lightning doesn’t strike you, I will!”
