Chapter 1621 - Because I’m Weak!

Translator: InVader

Lu Lige was stunned by what he heard Yang Ye say.

Are Zenith Realm experts very strong?

Of course!

Zenith Realm experts surpassed the Rebirth Realm. They could destroy a world in an instant. Even the heavens feared such experts!

Of course, that wasn’t the main point. The main point was Yang Ye’s tone. His tone made it sound like he looked down upon Zenith Realm experts.

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye paid no further attention to Lu Lige, and he turned to look at the Zenith Realm experts. After that, he clenched his fists. This time, a powerful aura surged out from him like a torrent. It caused the space in an area of 3km around him to start rippling like the surface of a lake.

A wisp of surprise flashed through Lu Lige’s eyes when he witnessed this scene. Obviously, Yang Ye’s strength had surpassed his expectations a little.

The Zenith Realm experts in front of Yang Ye exchanged glances, and they saw a trace of vigilance in each other’s eyes.

Suddenly, Yang Ye’s voice resounded in Lu Lige’s mind, “Leave first!”

It was a voice transmission.

Lu Life was slightly stunned, and then he shook his head and replied via voice transmission, “I, Lu Lige, can’t do something like that!”

Yang Ye shrugged, and then he took a step forward. In an instant, the Demon God’s energy surged through his body, and then he clenched his right fist and slammed it forward.

Heaven Obliteration!

Under the circumstances that he couldn’t use his sword, he could only utilize Heaven Obliteration when facing two Zenith Realm experts. Otherwise, he wouldn’t be able to fight them at all!

As soon as his fish shot forward, a terrifying force instantly sprayed out from his fist. In an instant, the space in a huge area around Yang Ye collapsed and was obliterated. At this moment, Yang Ye was surrounded by pitch black darkness.

At the moment he swung his fist, the Zenith Realm experts’ pupils had constricted. They didn’t dare act carelessly, and they pressed their palms forward. Instantly, two powerful waves of energy appeared out of thin air, and they seemed like a huge shield that resisted Yang Ye’s attack.

The collision between them caused the black hole around them to tremble violently.

A wisp of excitement flashed through Lu Lige’s eyes, “What a powerful fist technique. Go on, do it again. If you execute it again, then they…”

“Execute it again my ass!” Suddenly, Yang Ye’s voice resounded in Lu Lige’s mind, “Retreat!” As soon as he finished speaking, his figure shook and transformed into a ray of black light that vanished into the distance.

Even though Heaven Obliteration was strong, it was impossible for him to kill two Zenith Realm experts with it. Not to mention two, he couldn’t even kill one. Of course, Heaven Obliteration wasn’t weak, so even Zenith Realm experts wouldn’t dare to underestimate it!

Yang Ye’s objective was very simple. It was to push them back and cause trouble for them while he fled!

Yang Ye had turned around and fled as soon as he completed the attack!

Lu Lige was stunned when he saw Yang Ye flee. After all, Yang Ye had acted like Zenith Realm experts were trash just moments ago. Yet now, Yang Ye had immediately turned around and fled. Needless to say, he wasn’t really able to keep up because of this change.

However, his reaction was quite quick, and he immediately fled.

Even though he was very confident in his strength, he wasn’t so confident as to think he could fight two Zenith Realm experts on his own!

Suddenly, a ray of light from a spear shot through the air, and it was shooting towards the direction Yang Ye and Lu Lige were fleeing towards.

Yang Ye and Lu Lige’s faces fell when they witnessed this. Yang Ye was about to attack but Lu Lige was faster. A ray of saber energy flashed and slammed against the ray of light.

Boom!

As soon as they collided, they exploded like fireworks, and the aftershock from the collision forced Yang Ye and Lu Lige to a stop.

Meanwhile, Li Tianjiu appeared not too far away from them, and the violet robed man and another Zenith Realm expert arrived here right after him. Moreover, because they’d stopped for a moment, the other two Zenith Realm experts from before had caught up too.

At this moment, the three of them were surrounded by four Zenith Realm experts again.

Li Tianjiu glanced at Yang Ye and Lu Lige, and then he laughed coldly, “Don’t you feel bad for leaving just like that?”

Yang Ye glanced at the violet robed old man’s group of four, and then he gazed at Li Tianjiu and sent a voice transmission, “If we continue fighting like this, none of us will be able to escape. Let’s join forces first and resolve the matter between us later. Alright?”

Li Tianjiu was slightly visibly moved. If they joined forces, it wouldn’t be too difficult to deal with four Zenith Realm experts. But if they didn’t and acted against each other instead, then they would definitely be unable to escape!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye added, “Our speed isn’t superior to Zenith Realm experts at all. So, it’s meaningless to just flee. Thus, the best way is to kill them or force them to retreat.”

Hesitance appeared in Li Tianjiu’s eyes. Suddenly, the violet robed old man said, “Attack!”

As soon as he gave the order, he charged at Li Tianjiu.

Obviously, he’d realized that while Yang Ye and the others were inferior to his group in terms of cultivation, all three of them were geniuses. If they joined forces… Such circumstances weren’t something he wanted to see, so he’d decisively ordered the attack.

Li Tianjiu’s face turned cold when he saw the old man charge at him, and he immediately gazed at Yang Ye, “We’ll join forces for now!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he stomped his right foot down, and he transformed into a dazzling ray of light that shot towards the violet robed old man.

Yang Ye glanced at Li Tianjiu and Lu Lige, and then he said, “Both of you fight three, I’ll fight one.”

Li Tianjiu turned to glance at Yang Ye, “Why?!”

“Because I’m weak!” Yang Ye spoke indifferently, “Are you not ashamed to make me fight two on my own?”

The corners of Li Tianjiu’s eyes twitched slightly. He glanced coldly at Yang Ye, and then he continued his assault towards the violet robed old man.

Yang Ye patted Lu Lige on the shoulder, “Good luck!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he charged at one of the Zenith Realm experts.

Lu Lige felt speechless.

Just like that, Lu Lige and Li Tianjiu fought three Zenith Realm experts while Yang Ye fought just one.

Lu Lige and Li Tianjiu were very strong, and their joint forces were actually on par with three Zenith Realm experts.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye was in fierce combat with one Zenith Realm expert.

Needless to say, it was extremely strenuous for him. Because his physical strength couldn’t amount to a lethal threat to Zenith Realm experts, but the attacks of Zenith Realm experts were a lethal threat to him. After all, they could pierce through his physical defenses.

Fortunately, he had abundant combat experience and a terrifying recuperative ability, so he was barely able to fight that Zenith Realm expert. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Bang!

Yang Ye was blasted around 3km away. Once he stopped himself, he glanced at Li Tianjiu and Lu Lige. Yang Ye’s heart sank when he saw the situation that they were in.

He’d hoped by keeping a Zenith Realm expert busy, the two of them would be able to quickly defeat the remaining three Zenith Realm experts. However, he’d underestimated the strength of those Zenith Realm experts. Even though Li Tianjiu and Lu Lige could surmount their realms of cultivation to do battle, they weren’t able to gain the upper hand against three Zenith Realm experts. Conversely, they were gradually being pushed into a disadvantaged situation.

I can’t let this go on! Yang Ye’s face fell. Meanwhile, the space in front of him trembled, and then a flaming fist flashed out from there and slammed down at him.

Yang Ye’s expression remained calm as he clenched his right fist tightly, and then he slammed it forward!

Boom!

An explosion resounded, and then Yang Ye was blasted over 1km away again. As soon as he stopped, a flaming palm slapped down towards him while carrying boundless pressure. The space around him instantly started to warp beneath it.

A solemn expression flashed through Yang Ye’s eyes. Actually, he really wanted to use his sword. If he did, then he wouldn’t have to go through so much trouble. However, once he did that, his identity would definitely be exposed. At the very least, it was very disadvantageous to him for now.

Yang Ye fell silent for an instant, and then he stomped his right foot down and transformed into a thread of black light that charged up into space. When he arrived before the flaming palm, a wisp of ruthlessness flashed through his eyes, and then he slammed his fist upwards!

Elemental Breaker combined with energy rebound!

The reason he hadn’t used Heaven Obliteration was because it exhausted too much profound energy and physical strength. If he could use it to kill the Zenith Realm expert before him, then he wouldn’t mind the consumption. Unfortunately, it could only injure his opponent but not kill his opponent!

So, he’d decisively chosen to use Elemental Breaker combined with energy rebound!

Bang!

The flaming palm shook violently and cracked apart. Meanwhile, Yang Ye pulled his right hand back and slammed it upwards again.

Boom!

Yang Ye’s punch pierced through the center of the palm, and then Yang Ye transformed into a black ray of light that instantly vanished into the distance.

“You think you can flee?” The Zenith Realm expert grunted coldly, and then he vanished as well.

Just like that, Yang Ye and that Zenith Realm expert vanished.

Meanwhile, the battle was still going on!

Around 15 minutes later, the violet robed old man’s group, Li Tianjiu, and Lu Lige suddenly stopped fighting. They looked up towards the distance, and their pupils constricted when they witnessed the scene there. Their eyes were filled with disbelief.

A figure had appeared there, and it was Yang Ye who’d vanished earlier.

Yang Ye was holding a human head in his grasp, and it was the head of that Zenith Realm expert who’d been fighting Yang Ye!

Yang Ye casually tossed the head over towards Lu Lige and said, “Are Zenith Realm experts very strong?”

Lu Lige was at a loss for words.
