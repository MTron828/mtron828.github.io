Chapter 2700 – Deception!

Yang Ye frowned, and then he suppressed his bloodline a moment later.

Yang Ye looked into the distance. There was an ancient city standing there.

He walked toward it while often scanning the surroundings. The spirit energy here was scarce too, but it was much better than the Past Life Clan and Martial Sky Clan.

Those two words were almost devoid of spirit energy, but there was at least some here.

Something worth mentioning was that if he didn’t have Great Unknown, he couldn’t get here, not even with the path Yan Wu had provided.

This world was enveloped by a strand of mysterious energy that made it impossible to find. Even if one could find it, there was no way in!

Of course, it wasn’t a problem to those experts with absolutely extraordinary strength.

A short while later, Yang Ye arrived before the ancient city. Its gates were shut tight, and it seemed very old and deserted from the outside.

There were a lot of weeds all around the city’s walls!

Yang Ye fell silent for an instant, and then he walked over and pushed the gate open.

Creak!

A desolate scene appeared before him.

The streets were empty, and most of the buildings in the surroundings were in ruins.

Yang Ye walked forward all the way as he’d sensed signs of life.

The aura of humans!

Just as Yan Wu had told him, the Yang Clan hadn’t been completely annihilated.

There were some surviving members of the Yang Clan.

Suddenly, an old man appeared before Yang Ye, and Yang Ye stopped.

The old man glanced at the Great Unknown in Yang Ye’s grasp, “Destiny’s sword!”

Yang Ye nodded.

The old man fell silent.

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings, “How many of you are still alive?”

The old man’s eyes narrowed slightly, and then Yang Ye sensed an invisible pressure descend upon him.

Yang Ye shook his head, “I have no ill intent!”

The old man gazed at him for a long time. In the end, Yang Ye sensed the pressure gradually vanish.

The old man shook his head, “No matter who you are, I just want to say that we’re already in a state like this, so we don’t want any trouble, nor do we want to get mixed up in anything.”

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings and nodded, and then he walked away.

Suddenly, the old man said, “Wait!”

Yang Ye gazed at the old man, and the old man gazed at him for a long time before saying, “Can you give me a drop of your blood? I just want to have a look!”

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and flicked a drop of blood over to the old man.

The old man gazed at it, and his expression gradually changed.

“Impossible!” The old man gazed at it while seeming to be in a daze. A short while later, he gazed at Yang Ye, “You… No, this isn’t possible!”

Yang Ye frowned slightly, “What is it?”

The old man stared at Yang Ye, “You actually have my Yang Clan’s bloodline. While it’s quite scarce, you do have it!”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

Meanwhile, a white-haired woman appeared by the old man’s side. Besides that, another middle aged man with two pitch black steel balls in his hand appeared as well.

The middle aged man had even sealed off Yang Ye’s path of retreat.

However, it wasn’t like he planned to attack Yang Ye.

The three of them were just scanning him curiously.

Meanwhile, the woman touched the drop of Yang Ye’s blood and shook her head, “It isn’t the pure bloodline of our Yang Clan. It’s diluted. He should be a descendant of someone who left our clan… Not even a branch family.”

She shook her head slightly, “Useless!”

The middle aged man waved his hand, and the drop of blood flew over to him. He scanned it and spoke solemnly, “It’s not the same. This bloodline has reversed that person’s bloodline. However, it’s very much different from our Yang Clan’s pure bloodline.”

He gazed at the old man and continued, “What do you think?”

The old man glanced at Yang Ye, and then he glanced at the sword in Yang Ye’s grasp. He fell silent for a short while and said, “Who are you? Why do you have Destiny’s sword?”

Yang Ye glanced at them and smiled, “She gave it to me to slay evil!”

The old man frowned slightly and was quite displeased by Yang Ye’s answer.

Yang Ye shook his head and said, “I actually came here because I wanted to work together with you on something. But it seems that cannot happen. So, I’m leaving. You won’t stop me, right?”

The middle aged man suddenly said, “As a junior, you should be humbler before an elder of your clan! Even though you’re a descendant from who knows how many unions, you’re still a part of the Yang Clan.”

Yang Ye shook his head and chuckled, “You think I’m being arrogant? Or perhaps you want me to be as humble as possible before you?”

Meanwhile, the woman spoke coldly, “How unruly! Did your parents never teach you how to respect your elders? Or perhaps your parents are uncouth like you?”

The temperature here instantly turned cold.

Yang Ye walked slowly toward the woman. Her face remained indifferent. She didn’t care at all, and there was even a wisp of ridicule on the corners of her mouth.

Suddenly, Yang Ye vanished on the spot.

At the same instant, the expressions of everyone here changed!

Yang Ye was in front of the woman, and she instinctively released a powerful aura with the intent of suppressing Yang Ye. However, she’d far underestimated the one who stood before her.

At the instant Yang Ye’s sword was drawn, her powerful aura was instantly obliterated!

There were existences in this world who were capable of using their aura to suppress him, but those were rarely found, and many of them were on his side!

The woman’s expression had changed at the instant Yang Ye drew his sword.

This young man before them was an existence on their level!

She reacted very quickly, and she stretched out her right hand to clamp down on Yang Ye’s sword with her fingers!

She planned to stop it with two fingers!

Because as far as she was concerned, Yang Ye’s sword wasn’t that fast.

However, she was mistaken.

At the instant her fingers were about to clamp down on his sword…

Hiss!

Her fingers flew into the air, and then Yang Ye’s sword was against her throat.

The surroundings fell deathly silent.

The old man and middle aged man stared at Yang Ye, and besides seriousness, there was a trace of fear in their eyes!

Yang Ye looked the woman in the eyes, and then Great Unknown slowly moved horizontally to her shoulder, and then it descended.

Hiss!

In an instant, the woman’s entire right arm fell to the ground.

Blood sprayed like a fountain!

The middle aged man was about to attack, but the old man shook his head.

Yang Ye gazed at her, “Apologize?”

She gazed at Yang Ye for a few breaths of time, and then she said, “I was rude, please forgive me.”

Yang Ye lowered his sword and walked away.

Suddenly, the old man obstructed his path.

Yang Ye spoke indifferently, “What?”

The old man said, “Excuse our prior rashness.”

Yang Ye replied, “It’s fine. But allow me to be honest, you’ve been staying here for too long, and you should really go outside and take a look at the world. Besides that, this isn’t the era of the nine heavens and ten clans. If you still stay blindly conceited and refuse to wake up from the most dazzling era of the Yang Clan, you’ll die, sooner or later. The Past Life Clan and Martial Sky Clan did much better than you when it comes to following the times.”

The old man fell silent for a short while and said, “We naturally understand that. It’s why we’re unwilling to leave.”

Yang Ye nodded, “That’s your own problem!”

The old man glanced at Yang Ye and said, “You’re part of my Yang Clan too!”

Yang Ye shook his head and chuckled, “Seriously, if you go outside for some time, you probably wouldn’t dare to say that. Besides that, don’t think that me joining the Yang Clan will bring benefits to your clan. There are no benefits. Perhaps only your Yang Clan when it was at its prime would dare to go against my enemies.”

The old man frowned slightly, and then he exchanged glances with the middle aged man.

They naturally wanted to keep Yang Ye. While Yang Ye’s bloodline was a little diluted when compared to the main clan, but so what?

So long as someone was outstanding and formidable, all of that wouldn’t be a problem anymore!

Yet now, what Yang Ye said had made them hesitate slightly.

Yang Ye glanced at them and smiled, “See the sword in my hand? It’s Destiny’s sword. I’m what they call someone who’s chosen, and so countless cultivators have gathered together with the desire to kill me. There are even some old geezers from many years ago… Not some, there are many of them too.”

The middle aged man suddenly asked, “Do you have help?”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and replied, “My help is Destiny. They told me that they would help if I’m no match for my enemies. But I have to look for more help before then. Right, those who follow me also follow Destiny. You can think of it in that way!”

The old man and middle aged man exchanged glances, and both of them didn’t really believe Yang Ye. They felt Yang Ye was quite sly and not very reliable!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye withdrew another sword!

Past Life!

Yang Ye said, “See, I have two of their swords, and they said they’ll give me the other two soon.”

He glanced at the three of them, “The Past Life Clan and Martial Sky Clans have already agreed to take my side. I’m just here to ask if you’re willing to join forces with us?”Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

The old man asked solemnly, “What will the Yang Clan get out of it?”

Yang Ye smiled, “There are many benefits. For example, your Yang Clan can emerge into the world again and not hide forever. Or another example would be that you can avoid being hunted by Destiny… They told me that I can decide whether Destiny Realm experts have to be killed from now on.”

The old man glanced at Yang Ye. He felt like this fellow before him was trying to deceive them!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye summoned Snowy, “See? It’s the Good Sprite! Even she has expressed her agreement to join forces with me!”

Snowy blinked and quickly nodded.

She was fully cooperating with him!

All three of them were flabbergasted when they saw Snowy.

Fuck! It really is the Good Sprite!
