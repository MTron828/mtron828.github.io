Chapter 2092 – I Can Fight Ten More!

200,000? Needless to say, Yang Ye was stunned. But it only took a moment for him to come to an understanding.

It was a trap!

She’s brought him here to trap him!

Yang Ye gazed at her when he thought up to this point, and she still had a wide smile on her face.

Yang Ye smiled, “Actually, if that fruit and wine were really at the Sage Rank, they would be worth 200,000 immortal crystals. Unfortunately, they aren’t! What do you think?”

She smiled, “I think they are!”

Meanwhile, the young man suddenly said, “Are you planning to eat without paying?”

Suddenly, Yang Ye grabbed the young man by the throat.

It was fast!

Extremely fast!

The young man hadn’t even reacted before Yang Ye’s hand had clamped down on his throat. Yang Ye lifted him up and said, “I’ve never done that, but I think I’ll give it a try today!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye slammed the young man against the ground.

Bang!

The young man’s head exploded apart, and even the ground was blasted open.

Suddenly, two old men appeared.

Both were at the Major Zen Realm!

The black robed old man on the left walked over to Yang Ye, “Now, it isn’t just 200,000, it’s a million!”

“A million?” A smile curled up on Yang Ye’s face, “Needless to say, it’s a really good plan. Why didn’t I think of it? Right, I can try it in the future.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he stomped his right foot down, and then he leaped up like a tiger at the black robed old man.

The old man’s face instantly turned gloomy. He hadn’t expected the young man to dare attack after both of them arrived. However, he was prepared, and he immediately slammed his fist forward. Meanwhile, Yang Ye’s fist shot towards him too.

Bang!

As soon as their fists collided, a wave of powerful force slammed the old man away, and he slammed open a huge hole in the restaurant’s wall.

However, that wasn’t the end of it. Yang Ye slammed his palms against the ground.

Boom!

In an instant, the entire restaurant was obliterated!

At this moment, countless experts gazed in the restaurant’s direction.

Right when the restaurant was obliterated, the woman intended to flee, but she’d been a step slower. Yang Ye had appeared in front of her, and he grabbed her by the throat before she could say anything. After that, he slowly lifted her up, and her countenance instantly started turning purple.

The other old man hurriedly said, “You can’t harm her!”

“I can’t? Yang Ye gazed at the old man and smiled, “I can’t because you said so?”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye started squeezing.

The woman’s eyes seemed like they were bulging out.

The old man was shocked, “Young… Young Brother, we can talk about this. We can discuss it. Please don’t harm her!”

“We can?” Yang Ye gazed at the old man and relaxed his grip a little. He said, “Very good. Since we can discuss it, then we shall. One million, compensate me one million immortal crystals for the distress you’ve caused me. Alright?”

One million immortal crystals!

The old man’s face turned quite unsightly, “That’s extortion!”

“Extortion?” Yang Ye laughed coldly, “Weren’t you doing the same?”

Yang Ye would naturally not show any mercy to some people. Why? Because he was very well aware that if he didn’t possess sufficient strength, they would have probably cleaned him out, and even surviving would have been a problem.

Meanwhile, the old man wanted to say more, but Yang Ye said, “I don’t want to waste my breath on you. Three breaths of time, that’s all I’ll give you. I’ll break her neck if I don’t see my immortal crystals by them. I always keep my word!”

Suddenly, a beautiful woman appeared beside the old man. She glanced at the headless corpse on the ground, and then she gazed at the woman by Yang Ye’s side. In the end, her gaze descended upon Yang Ye, “Which sect are you from? I have some ties with most sects. I…”

“Cut the crap!” Yang Ye interrupted her, “I’m not from any sect. Just get the immortal crystals to me. If you don’t have them, just tell me, and I’ll just break her neck. Besides that, I’ll break her neck right now if you waste my time. You can try me if you think I don’t dare!”

She gazed at him for a long time before she said, “An hour, I need an hour to get a million immortal crystals!”

“15 minutes!” Yang Ye looked the beautiful woman in the eyes, “Not even a moment longer. Besides that, I’m really impatient. So, I’ll kill all of you if you test my patience again.”

She gazed at Yang Ye, and didn’t say a word. However, the old man by her side left.

Yang Ye released his grip. The woman was just about to flee when Yang Ye suddenly said, “I guarantee that even if you have three Sages protecting you, I can kill you in the instant that you take that step. Want to try me?”

She glanced at him, hesitated for a moment, and then sat down in the end. At this moment, she’d calmed down, and she gazed at Yang Ye and asked, “Are you from one of the four paths in the large universe?”

Yang Ye closed his eyes and ignored her.

She didn’t say another word either.

Time trickled by. Around 15 minutes passed quickly. Yang Ye opened his eyes and gazed at the woman, and the latter turned to the side. An old man appeared out of thin air there, and then he passed a spatial ring to her. She flicked it over to Yang Ye.

Yang Ye glanced at it, and there were exactly a million immortal crystals in it!

Yang Ye put it away and gazed at the woman, “Your life is very precious!”

He turned around and walked away.

Suddenly, three old men and two middle aged men appeared not too far away from Yang Ye. Yang Ye turned around and gazed at the beautiful woman. The latter started walking slowly in Yang Ye’s direction, “Come, let me see how strong you are!”

Yang Ye gazed at her and said, “Looks like that million isn’t that easy to take!”

He glanced at the five people behind him and continued, “Five Major Zen Realm experts? Too few! They’re not enough!”

Yang Ye turned around, and a sword appeared in his grasp. After that, he transformed into a ray of light that flashed through the area.

At the instant Yang Ye vanished, the expressions of all five experts before him changed drastically. They sensed extreme danger. They didn’t dare act carelessly at all, and five terrifying auras swept out from them and slammed down towards the ray of light. However, the ray of light sliced through them with absolute ease. After that, a speck of cold light appeared on the forehead of one of the old men. The old man was just about to retreat, but it was too late.

Hiss!

The ray of light shot through the old man’s forehead, and the old man’s figure stiffened on the spot. However, that wasn’t the end of it, the ray of light shot toward the next person.

At the instant they saw the old man being killed, an extremely solemn expression appeared on all their faces. At this moment, they didn’t dare to underestimate Yang Ye at all, and they treated the young man before them as half a Sage.

As for the beautiful woman, her face turned extremely unsightly.

She knew she’d underestimated him!

She knew that she’d far underestimated the young man before her. The reason she had chosen not to let the matter rest was Yang Ye’s age. As far as she was concerned, he couldn’t be that strong at his age!

If a single Major Zen Realm expert couldn’t defeat him, then what about five?

However, the facts told her that she was mistaken. She’d heard of such monstrous geniuses in the past. They were existences who couldn’t be judged by convention. Now, she’d met one. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“AH!” Suddenly, a shrill cry resounded from afar. She looked up and saw another Major Zen Realm expert fall.

She slowly clenched her fists.

“Madam, take the young miss and go!” Suddenly, one of them shouted at her.

She stopped holding on to any hope when she heard this, and then she gazed at the woman, “Go!”

The woman replied, “Come with me!”

Slap!

The beautiful woman slapped her and shouted, “Oh Eldest Young Miss of mine, learn from this! Take it as a lesson, and consider your own strength before acting as you please. Hu Fei, don’t you forget that these five elders and I died because of you. Now, fuck off!”

As soon as she finished speaking, she grabbed the woman’s shoulder and tossed her away. It only took an instant for the woman to vanish from the beautiful woman’s field of vision.

The beautiful woman took a deep breath and turned to look at Yang Ye. Meanwhile, only two more experts were left in battle with Yang Ye. However, they were completely suppressed and couldn’t even fight back!

“Is he a Sage?” The woman closed her eyes slowly. Two breaths of time later, she said, “Stop!”

The two Major Zen Realm experts immediately stopped when they heard her, but Yang Ye didn’t.

A ray of light flashed, and one of their heads flew up into the air. The other had despair all over his face. Sure enough, Yang Ye turned to look at him after killing the other expert. A moment later, he saw a ray of light flash, and then time froze. He just saw a ray of light, and it was the last thing he saw.

Hiss!

A string of blood sprayed from the forehead of the last Major Zen Realm expert.

Yang Ye lowered his sword and turned to look at the beautiful woman, “I think I can still fight ten more!”
