Chapter 169 – Domineering

The Second Prince was about to stop Head Guard Huang, but he was still too late because the exasperated Head Guard Huang had already launched an attack towards Bao’er.

Right when his figure arrived 6m in front of Bao’er, a person suddenly appeared before Bao’er. That person waved his hand, and Head Guard Huang who was already a Spirit Realm expert had been instantly blasted flying.

It was none other than Bao’er’s Grandfather and Yang Ye’s master, Lin Shan!

Lin Shan glanced coldly at Head Guard Huang who’d been blasted flying, and then he said, “Who do you think you are to actually dare attack my granddaughter?”

As soon as he finished speaking, he turned around to look at the Second Prince and said, “Your Highness, Second Prince, I want to kill him. You don’t have any objections, right?”

The Second Prince naturally recognized Lin Shan, so he knew that he’d bit off more than he could chew. He immediately said, “So it’s Senior Lin Shan, it was my subordinate’s mistake for making a move against your granddaughter. Now, he’s heavily injured already. So, let us leave the matter at that, alright?” He would naturally not nod and say he has no objections because if he did that, then would anyone stand on his side in the future?

Lin Shan smiled coldly, and then he turned to look at Yang Ye and said, “Kid, kill him!”

The Second Prince’s expression turned grim when he heard this, and a strand of killing intent flashed in his eyes.

Yang Ye smiled, and then his figure flashed to arrive before the heavily injured Head Guard Huang. With a flick of his sword, a head was instantly tossed into the air.

When he saw the head of his subordinate flying into the air, the Second Prince’s became extremely gloomy, and he said, “Senior Lin Shan, aren’t you being too disrespectful to my Grand Qin Empire?”

Lin Shan didn’t answer the Second Prince, and he looked at Yang Ye instead and said, “Tell me what happened earlier!”

Yang Ye nodded when he heard this, and then he described everything that occurred between Qing Hong’s group of three and the Imperial Guards.

Lin Shan laughed coldly when he finished listening to Yang Ye, and then he said, “Second Prince, it’s said that the rules of the Empire are strict. But I never expected that such people would appear beneath your rule. Moreover, not only did you not investigate the matter, you assisted the wicked instead and intended to protect your own subordinates by killing my disciple. Second Prince, don’t you think you should give me an explanation?”

“It’s merely a one-sided story!” The Second Prince spoke coldly.

“A one-sided story?” Lin Shan said, “Since it’s like that, then let us ask the people in the surroundings! Is anyone willing to step forward and describe the sequence of events of the incident? I’ll reward you with three mid-grade Strength Talismans and a single mid-grade Strider Talisman!”

The people in the surroundings were tempted when they heard this. It was four mid-grade talismans! However, even though they were tempted, none stood forward. After all, they weren’t idiots because they would have to utterly offend the Second Prince if they stood forward now!

“Five Strength Talismans and three Strider Talismans! Mid-grade!” Lin Shan raised the price.

Finally, an independent cultivator was unable to resist the temptation and stood forward, and he described everything that occurred earlier.

When he finished listening, Lin Shan waved his hand and eight talismans flew towards that independent cultivator!

“Thank you senior!” The independent cultivator bowed to Lin Shan, and then he ran away from the city without looking back. He would naturally not be stupid enough to stay in the city!

The Second Prince glanced coldly at that independent cultivator, and then he looked at Lin Shan and said, “Senior Lin, it was my oversight that caused this matter. But the two main conspirators are crippled and dead. So, let us leave the matter at that, alright?”

“That’s naturally for the best!” said Lin Shan.

The Second Prince nodded lightly, and then he glanced at Yang Ye and Bao’er before he turned around and left.

“Master, can these two friends of mine be saved!?” When he saw the Second Prince leave, Yang Ye hurriedly brought the heavily injured Man’zi and Xiao Hei over to Lin Shan.

Lin Shan took a glance at them before he shook his head and said, “They can live, but they can only be ordinary people in the future!”

A wisp of sorrow appeared in Qing Hong’s eyes upon hearing this. Because how could Man’zi and Xiao Hei accept becoming ordinary people in the future?

“Is there really no way to heal their Dantians?” Yang Ye was slightly unwilling to leave it like that. In the end, both of them had been reduced to this state because of him!

Lin Shan shook his head and said, “I’ve never seen anyone being able to recover from having his Dantian shattered into pieces. Kid, they’re extremely fortunate to be able to survive. With their constitutions, they would at most be able to attain the First Heaven Realm or King Realm even if they remained as Profounders. Moreover, becoming an ordinary person may not necessarily be a bad thing!”

Yang Ye was about to say something when Qing Hong said, “Senior is right, becoming an ordinary person may not necessarily be a bad thing. At the very least, my Big Brother and Xiao Hei don’t have to live such dangerous lives anymore.” Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Yang Ye sighed in his heart when he heard this, and he didn’t say anything.

Lin Shan nodded and said, “It’s good that you’re able to accept it, little girl!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he looked at Yang Ye and said, “Kid, you didn’t even come to look for me after you arrived at the Imperial Capital, and you even led Bao’er to cause trouble here. Do you know how much danger both of you were in just now? That Second Prince isn’t an ordinary figure. Moreover, there’s an Exalt Realm expert following him from the shadows!”

“It was the Little Laborer than asked me to blast him!” Meanwhile, Bao’er was extremely disloyal and sold Yang Ye out.

Yang Ye glared fiercely at Bao’er, and then he smiled bitterly and said, “I couldn’t just do nothing. Moreover, don’t I still have you, Master? With you standing behind us, wouldn’t Bao’er and I be able to roam freely through the Imperial Capital?”

Bao’er hurriedly nodded and said, “The Little Laborer is right. With Grandpa here, would anyone dare to bully the Little Laborer and me?”

Lin Shan patted Bao’er on the head and said, “Don’t tell me that. Didn’t I tell you not to cause trouble in the Imperial Capital? Look at the surroundings, how much would your Grandpa have to pay to deal with all of this?”

As soon as he finished speaking, he looked at Yang Ye and said, “As for you, kid. You need to change that character of yours. The Imperial Capital is different, and all sorts of experts are hidden here. Just like the incident from before, do you think you would be able to survive if that Exalt Realm Expert following the Second Prince had made a move?”

Yang Ye nodded and said, “I was rash!”

Lin Shan sighed and said, “Kid, your Master, I, does possess some reputation and influence in the Imperial Capital. No one would do anything to you while I’m there, but you must realize that they don’t have to deal with you openly! Or perhaps they kill you before I arrive? Moreover, it’s best not to get mixed up with the Imperial Household. It’s full of ‘undercurrents’, and even I might not be able to save you if something happens!”

Yang Ye smiled bitterly. What could he say? Naturally, he could only nod and agree in an obedient manner.

After a short while, Lin Shan stopped lecturing Yang Ye and said, “Right, your younger sister is about to break through into the First Heaven Realm, and she’s in closed door cultivation right now. Make a trip to the Talisman Master’s Association once you’ve dealt with the matters here. That little girl misses you every single day.”

“She’s going to break through into the First Heaven Realm?” Yang Ye was shocked. Only a few months have passed since then, yet Little Yao is about to break through? Isn’t her speed of cultivation too quick!?

Lin Shan nodded and said, “That little girl’s natural talent isn’t bad, and she’s willing to work hard. Coupled with my guidance and fostering, advancing into the First Heaven Realm isn’t difficult!”

Yang Ye bowed to Lin Shan, and then he said, “Thank you, Master, for fostering Little Yao!”

Lin Shan smiled and said, “What are you thanking me for? I’ve taken that little girl to be my own granddaughter. It’s you who surprised me. You’ve actually advanced to the First Heaven Realm, and you seem to be much stronger than before. No wonder you dared to participate in the Ascension Rankings!

“I had some fortuitous encounters!” said Yang Ye with a smile on his face.

Meanwhile, Bao’er who’d put on an obedient appearance just now suddenly asked. “Little Laborer, you’re participating in the Ascension Rankings?”

Yang Ye nodded, and then he glanced at her with a vigilant expression as he said, “What sort of wicked ideas do you have now!?”

Presently, he was slightly afraid of Bao’er because this little she-devil was even more unrestrained than him, and she was truly one that did things without considering the consequences!

“Can I participate with you?” Bao’er gazed at Yang Ye with a slightly hopeful gaze. There are so many people participating in the Ascension Rankings, so it would definitely be extremely fun. Most importantly, I wouldn’t be scolded for blasting people up....

“No!”

“No!”

Yang Ye and Lin Shan spoke at the same time. What a joke! The monstrous geniuses participating in the Ascension Rankings wouldn’t care whose granddaughter she was. Once one participated in the competition, life and death were up to fate, and no one could take revenge after the competition. This was a rule set jointly by the six great powers and the Grand Qin Empire. With Bao’er’s strength, wouldn’t she be courting death by participating in the Ascension Rankings?

“You’re running wild!” Lin Shan berated. “Do you think the Ascension Rankings is like the Sword Sect and you can bully others as you please? Don’t keep thinking of these useless things and study the Talisman Dao properly!”

“I knew I wouldn’t be allowed to do it!” Bao’er puckered her mouth and muttered.

Lin Shan glared at her, and then he looked at Yang Ye and said, “Make arrangements for your friends then come to the Talisman Master’s Association. I’ll change the grade on your badge for you. With your current strength, you’re completely qualified to wear the badge of an Earth Talisman Master!” As soon as he finished speaking, Lin Shan pulled Bao’er by the hand as he left.
