Chapter 796 – The Strength Of The 3rd Level!

Editor: Conspiracing

Xiao Ying had an extremely solemn expression in her eyes as she watched this scene from afar.

After all, 2nd level Heaven Rank sword intent wasn’t a huge deal to her. However, 3rd level Heaven Rank sword intent was a completely different story. It was something that could even pose a threat to an expert at her level.

Yang Ye slowly opened his eyes, and then 2 rays of light suddenly shot out from them.

Hiss!

The space before him was instantly shattered into pieces, and a pitch black spatial rift was formed. However, it didn’t take long for it to vanish and return to its original state.

Perfection in Heaven Rank sword intent! Yang Ye stood up and flicked with his finger. A ray of light shot forward, and then the space before him was like a piece of paper while his sword intent was like a sharp blade. It sliced through the space before him with absolute ease. Moreover, it continued forward while leaving a long and pitch black spatial rift behind.

Yang Ye withdrew his gaze, closed his eyes slightly, and then issued a command in his heart.

Bang!

Besides where he stood, the space in an area of 300m around him was instantly shattered, and a huge black hole appeared around him!

But it didn’t take long for the space around him to be restored.

Yang Ye was shocked in his heart. Because he’d merely used his sword intent to suppress the surroundings. However, he hadn’t imagined that just that would actually be beyond the endurance of the space around him, and it immediately collapsed!

“To a certain extent, 3rd level Heaven Rank sword intent is on par with the Spatial Laws of this world.” Xiao Ying walked over to Yang Ye’s side and said, “You can give it a try. Make your sword intent merge into this expanse of space and see what happens!”

“Merge it into this expanse of space?” Yang Ye was quite puzzled by this.

“She’s right. You can give it a try!” Meanwhile, the Sword Spirit suddenly appeared by Yang Ye’s side, and there was shock and pleasant surprise in her eyes. “The unique trait of 3rd level Heaven Rank sword intent is its ability to merge with sword techniques, the space, the heavens and the earth, and even the energy of the Laws. Just give it a try!”

“You’re alright now?” Yang Ye was delighted when he saw her.

She nodded and said, “I didn’t expect you to actually dare to absorb the Unfettered One’s sword intent. After all, his sword intent can be considered to be the strongest sword intent in the history of this world. What I didn’t expect even more is that you actually succeeded. Because of that, my injuries were completely recovered after I absorbed some 3rd level Heaven Rank sword intent!”

Yang Ye nodded, and then he issued a command in his heart. His sword intent surged out from within him. He gradually noticed that his sword intent actually could merge into space as they’d said, and it actually merged completely into one!

Meanwhile, the Sword Spirit suddenly flicked with her finger, and a strand of sword energy shot towards Yang Ye. However, it suddenly exploded apart when it arrived 3m away from Yang Ye!

“See that? My sword energy could have easily torn through the space before you. However, once your sword intent merged into that area of space, it greatly strengthened it to the point that my sword energy wasn’t able to pierce through space at all.” The Sword Spirit continued, “Of course, its true strength is far from just that.”

Yang Ye hurriedly asked, “What else can it do?”

She grinned and said, “Your sword intent can merge with space, so it naturally can merge with sword techniques. You can merge it into your sword techniques when you execute them, and then merge that technique with space. After that, use the characteristics of space to attack. Try it!”

Yang Ye didn’t hesitate to flick with his finger, and a strand of sword energy shot forward. After sword intent merged into that strand of sword energy, Yang Ye hurriedly did as the Sword Spirit said and merged it with space as well. After that, a shocking scene appeared. That strand of sword energy actually vanished!

To be precise, it was concealed upon merge into space. Moreover, his eyes were utterly incapable of discerning that there was a strand of sword energy hidden within space! If that strand of sword energy wasn’t linked to his mind, then he wouldn’t even be able to sense it!

The Sword Spirit explained, “After it’s merged into space, you can utilize the special characteristics of space. In short, you can make your sword energy travel straight through space and attack your enemies as swiftly as possible without using the Void Flash Sword like you did in the past!”

Yang Ye issued a command in his heart, and then a stone statue which was over 1km away instantly exploded into pieces!

It was even swifter than his attacks when he executed Lightspeed!

Tempestuous waves of shock surged incessantly in Yang Ye’s heart.

Meanwhile, the Sword Spirit continued, “Once your sword techniques are merged with space, they become concealed, and you’re even able to utilize the special characteristics of space.... When you execute Heavenrend of the Tri-Apex Sword Technique next time, add your Decay Laws into it. Then, even Supreme Exalt He might be instantly killed by a single attack from you if he’s even slightly careless. Of course, if you fight him normally, and he takes precautions, then it’s better for you to not even fight him!”

When she spoke up to this point, she raised her hands slightly and drew a circle, “If you’re using your sword intent to suppress your opponents in the future, you can merge it into space, the air, and even the spirit energy around you. In that way, it’s equivalent to relying on the might of the world to suppress your opponent. Under such circumstances, ordinary Half-Saints wouldn’t even be able to utilize 5% of their strengths, and even the ability of existences like Supreme Exalt He would be greatly restricted!”

“How powerful!” Yang Ye took a deep breath. Needless to say, even he was shocked by the ability of his 3rd level Heaven Rank sword intent. If he were to launch surprise and sneak attacks now, then it would be absolutely easy for him to kill mid-grade Half-Saints. It was even to the extent that he had a chance at killing high-grade Half-Saints.

“While you’re still not a Half-Saint now, even high-grade Half-Saints would absolutely not dare to look down on you!” Xiao Ying continued, “You... have really surprised me.”

Yang Ye shook his head and said, “While I can pose a threat to high-grade Half-Saints, I’m very well aware that I’m absolutely no match for them in a head on battle. Of course, I’m not stupid enough to do that. Surprise and sneak attacks are the way to success!”

Xiao Ying’s eyelids twitched. Because if Yang Ye were to launch a surprise attack on her, then even she would have a huge headache. Because Yang Ye’s ability to conceal himself was truly too formidable. Coupled with the fact that his sword intent and sword energy could be merged into space now and become concealed, it was even more terrifying.

Yang Ye checked on the Half-Saint Sword Servants within him, and then a slight grin appeared on the corners of his mouth. He looked up at Xiao Ying and said, “You’ve finished gathering your forces, right?” Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

She nodded in response, “Let’s set out right now. People are still being teleported incessantly to the Hallowed Grounds from Profounder Continent. You might lose all of them if you’re too late.”

“Since they chose to surrender to the Hallowed Grounds, then let them. Why should I stop them?” Yang Ye spoke indifferently.

Xiao Ying’s heart shook. She glanced at Yang Ye with a gaze that carried deep meaning, and then she said, “So long as it’s within the Hallowed Grounds, then you just have to say the word, and I’ll bring my forces there no matter where it is.”

“You can do that?” Yang Ye spoke with surprise.

She glanced at him, and then she turned around and left.

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

“You fool. The area above ground in the Hallowed Grounds can be said to belong to the Hallowed Grounds and the defiant profounders, but the underground world belonged to her. While she is beneath the ground, she definitely has her ways to be aware of your whereabouts. So, she’ll be following you with those Half-Saint Fire Spirits of hers. Understand?” said the Sword Spirit.

“That’s really not bad!” Yang Ye nodded and said, “Let’s go!”

She asked, “You intend to fight the Hallowed Grounds and the defiant profounders to the death right now?”

Yang Ye shook his head and said, “They’ll be attacking Profounder Continent very soon, and a battle to the death is unavoidable. However, I still have something to do now.”

“What?”

A cold glow flashed through Yang Ye’s eyes, “That defiant profounder who heavily injured you that day is definitely still looking for me. Hehe. Don’t you want to take revenge?”

“He’s a high-grade Half-Saint!” The Sword Spirit spoke solemnly, “While you’ve become stronger, it’s impossible for you to kill him!”

“I still want to give it a try!” As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye’s figure flashed and vanished on the spot.

“Is it because of me?” The Sword Spirit muttered softly, and then she transformed into a ray of light that vanished from there as well.

After Yang Ye emerged from the ground, he completely dispersed his Sword Domain, and it didn’t even take 2 breaths of time for the space near him to fluctuate violently. After that, a black robed man who held a spear walked out from within that expanse of space.

“Didn’t you want to play with me? Why did you hide for....” A ferocious expression arose on the corners of the man’s mouth. He was about to say something, but he didn’t even get to finish before rays of white light flashed. A breath of time later, his expression changed violently because there were over 1,000 Half-Saints around him. Moreover, all of them were mid-grade Half-Saints!

“You....” He was astounded, and he was about to say something. However, his cultivation suddenly dropped to the Monarch Realm. After that, all those mid-grade Half-Saints pounced at him!

The black robed man was a high-grade Half-Saint at any rate. So, it only took him an instant to react. He moved both of his hands forward with the intention of tearing space apart and fleeing. However, he noticed to his horror that he was actually unable to tear it open!

Terror and bewilderment appeared in the man’s eyes as he tried once more....

A gap was torn open in space under the might of his full strength. However, it was very small. It was only the size of a thumb! It was impossible for him to enter through such a hole!

After that.... There was no after that!

The black robed man was dead. He dead with everlasting regret. His eyes were opened wide, and they were filled with terror and bewilderment. Of course, there was even more resentment in his eyes!

Yang Ye walked over to the black robed man, and he shook his head as he gazed at the black robed man’s corpse, “Ganging up on others is the way to success!”

Meanwhile, the space all around him started to vibrate!
