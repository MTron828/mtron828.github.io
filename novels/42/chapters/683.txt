Chapter 684 – Yang Ye’s Origins!

Yang Ye was slightly stunned, and then he said, “How do you know that?”

The middle aged man didn’t answer Yang Ye, he just stared fixedly at Yang Ye. Excitement gradually appeared in his eyes, but it didn’t take long for the excitement to transform into bewilderment. He said, “How could that be possible? How could the Young Master have possibly...?”

Elder Mu, Yang Ye, and An Nanjing frowned while bewilderment filled their eyes as well.

It was the same for the grey robed man and Yin Xuan’er who stood afar. Their eyes were filled with a puzzled expression.

A short while passed before the middle aged man suddenly gazed at Yang Ye and said, “Give me a drop of your blood!”

Yang Ye pondered deeply for a moment, and he didn’t refuse in the end. He flicked over a droplet of his blood to the middle aged man.

The middle aged man took a deep breath after he gazed at it for a short while, and he said, “It’s the blood of the Yang Clan indeed. Even though there are a few other types of blood mixed within it, the blood of the Yang Clan still remains.”

When he spoke up to this point, the middle aged man’s gaze towards Yang Ye had become gentle, “Are you parents still alive?”

Yang Ye tightened his grip on the ancient sheath and said, “My mother is gone. As for my father, I’ve never met him. Who exactly are you?”

The middle aged man said, “My surname is Lu, and my name consists of a single word, Yan. I’m your father’s servant, and now... I’m yours as well!”

Servant!Elder Mu’s eyelids twitched when he heard this. Even he couldn’t avoid feeling utterly astonished right now.

Meanwhile, the expressions of Yin Xuan’er and the grey robed old man had changed drastically. It was especially so for the grey robed man because the shock within his heart had risen to its extremes. Servant!? An expert who was once at the Saint Realm or even above the Saint Realm is actually Yang Ye’s father’s servant?Who’s his father?

Yang Ye was extremely shocked as well. He hadn’t expected that this expert before him would actually know his father whom he’d never met, and he’d never imagined that this expert would actually be his father’s servant.

“You probably have many questions!” The middle aged man said, “However, I won’t tell you too much. Because it isn’t beneficial to you at all. You just have to know that both your father and I were banished. As for why we were banished, I can’t tell you the answer to that.”

“Tell me what you can!” said Yang Ye.

The middle aged man nodded, and then he glanced at the grey robed man and Yin Xuan’er. Both of them instantly seemed as if they were facing a formidable enemy.

Meanwhile, the middle aged man asked, “Are they your friends?”

Yang Ye glanced at them, and then he said, “The woman is, but not the man!” Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“I understand!” The middle aged man was about to act when the grey robed man suddenly said, “Yang Ye, my northern territory is willing to surrender to the southern territory! Unconditionally!”

“Kill him!” Yang Ye remained unmoved.

The middle aged man glanced at Yang Ye, and then he made a grabbing motion towards the grey robed man. A hand tore through space as it instantly arrived above the grey robed man, and the terrifying energy it contained caused the space around the grey robed man to warp. However, Yin Xuan’er who stood by the grey robed man’s side wasn’t affected at all!

“Skyshatter!” The grey robed man roared furiously as he clenched his right fist tightly, and then he smashed his fist towards the hand. An enormous fist that was over 100m wide flashed up and collided with the enormous palm above him.

Bang!

They immediately exploded apart on contact, and the grey clothed man spat out a mouthful of blood.

“Eh?” The middle aged man exclaimed with surprise, “Energy that doesn’t belong to this world. Looks like you’re from outside this world as well.” He was just about to attack again when the grey robed man suddenly took off his cloak, and then a familiar face appeared before Yang Ye!

Yang Ye, An Nanjing, and Elder Mu’s expressions changed, and there was a trace of shock in their eyes. The shock in Yin Xuan’er’s eyes was even greater because she hadn’t imagined that the formed Grand Preceptor of the Shang Dynasty would actually possess 3 identities....

Lu Yuanhao!

The grey robed man was the city governor of Ancient Domain City, Lu Yuanhao!

“It’s was you!” Yang Ye spoke in a low voice. He hadn’t imagined that the Grand Preceptor would actually be City Governor Lu, Lu Jianyao’s father!

Lu Yuanhao laughed bitterly. He didn’t want to expose his identity, but he would die if he didn’t. He would absolutely be unable to escape if the middle aged man joined forces with the Undertaker, so he had no choice but to expose his identity!

Lu Yuanhao glanced at the middle aged man and Elder Mu before his gaze descended onto Yang Ye, and he said, “Yang Ye, I told you before, we’re not enemies. The reason I stopped you just now was mainly because I was afraid the Exalted Han Empire would release him. You’ve witnessed his strength as well. No one in this world can stop him.”

Yang Ye remained silent.

Lu Yuanhao continued, “Your master is aware of my identity. My enemy is the Hallowed Grounds and not you. We can even be said to have a common enemy.” The reason he gave such an explanation was because he knew that his fate rested in Yang Ye’s hands.

“Let him live!” Meanwhile, Elder Mu suddenly said, “One more friend is better than another enemy. I know what you’re worried about. Don’t worry, he won’t collude with the Hallowed Grounds.”

Yang Ye stopped hesitating when he heard this, and he nodded, “City Governor Lu, I hope you were telling the truth, because I don’t want to be enemies with you for Jianyao’s sake.” As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye’s heart felt much more relaxed because the human world was truly united. As for the devil territory, oceanic clans.... Especially the oceanic clans, it had no Half-Saints protecting it, so it was nothing to worry about!

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts and gazed at Lu Yan. Lu Yan said, “Your father and I are from a distant universe, and there are countless clans there. Amongst them are the 8 superior clans. Their strengths are beyond your imagination, and you just have to understand that the weakest amongst them possesses at least 3,000 minor worlds under their command!”

Lu Yuanhao’s eyelids twitched when he heard this, and he revealed astonishment in his eyes.

“Minor worlds?” Yang Ye frowned as he didn’t understand such a term.

“It’s equivalent to 10 Profounder Continents!” Lu Yuanhao spoke with a solemn expression on his face.

10 Profounder Continents!Yang Ye, Elder Mu, and An Nanjing were shocked. Because it was 3,000 minor worlds, and a single minor world was comparable to 10 Profounder Continents.... It truly made them wonder what sort of power it was!

Lu Yan glanced at Lu Yuanhao and said, “You know those defiant profounders, right? They’re from one of the 8 superior clans, the Gu Clan.”

When he spoke up to this point, Lu Yan sized up Yang Ye and said, “You really surprised me because you were able to attain such accomplishments at such an age while residing in a world with such scarce spirit energy. It’s truly a rare accomplishment. However, it’s far from sufficient.”

Yang Ye said, “I have no intention to interfere in the disputes of your world!”

“You’re still too young!” Lu Yan shook his head and said, “In this world, you aren’t just free of trouble because you didn’t seek it out or offend anyone. Not to mention the world that your father and I are from, even if we speak only about this world, your strength is still too weak. The spirit energy in this world has dried up to the point it’s on the verge of destruction. Only death awaits you if you don’t charge out of this world. Moreover, those fellows above us won’t just allow us to charge out there.”

“Is it not possible even with your strength?” said Yang Ye in a low voice.

“I alone am not enough!” Lu Yan said, “Perhaps I can give it a try if I’m able to recover my full strength. Unfortunately, there’s no Primordial Violet Energy here, so I’ll never be able to recover.”

Quintessence Primordial Energy.... Yang Ye closed his eyes slightly. He had Quintessence Primordial Energy, but it wasn’t much. Moreover, besides a few whom he really trusted; he would absolutely not tell anyone else about it until he had the strength to protect himself.

The Primordial Pagoda was too important and precious. Once it was exposed, then it wouldn’t just be the Hallowed Grounds and defiant profounders who stopped at nothing to seize it from him, even these experts who were his allies might target him as well.

At that time, he wouldn’t be able to survive even if he had 100 lives!

“So, doesn’t that mean we have no choice but to wait for death to arrive?” An Nanjing spoke abruptly.

Lu Yan chuckled and said, “Of course not. People are capable of anything when they’re forced into a corner. There are extremely formidable figures amongst the defiant profounders. Even though they aren’t at the Saint Realm now, they were once experts at a realm even higher than the Saint Realm. If they were to really disregard everything, then it wouldn’t be impossible for them to kill Saint Realm experts while at the Half-Saint Realm!”

“The defiant profounders might be our enemies as well!” said An Nanjing.

“In the end, the Heaven Dao and those fellows above the Heaven Dao will be everyone’s enemy!” Lu Yan explained, “Of course, the deep-rooted bad habits of humans makes it so that we’ll never unite as one unless it’s a moment of life and death. So, it’s impossible to avoid fighting and killing each other!”

Meanwhile, Lu Yuanhao said, “You’re very right. Humans will never unite as one unless it’s a moment of life and death.”

Lu Yan said, “Any inhabited place is linked to the interests of others, and there’s always conflict where personal interests are concerned.”

When he spoke up to this point, he gazed at Yang Ye and said, “You’re a member of the Yang Clan. Even though you’re just the son of a banished descendant, you’re still a member of the Yang Clan in the end. There are some things that you can’t escape!”

Yang Ye shook his head and said, “Some things are too far away. Let’s talk about the present for now. You’ve recovered your freedom now, so what do you plan to do after this?”

“Follow you, of course!” Lu Yan replied, “You’re my only chance at returning to the Yang Clan.”

Yang Ye nodded and said, “I don’t know if I’ll return to the Yang Clan, but having you by my side will definitely be extremely beneficial to me. I’ll remember this kindness, and I’ll definitely repay you in the future.”

Lu Yan smiled. He didn’t think Yang Ye could help him with anything, but he didn’t refuse it. He flicked his finger, and a scroll made out of jade flew towards Yang Ye as he said, “According to the conventions of this world, this is a divine technique for sword cultivators. It’s called Lightspeed, and it has 3 stages. The 1st stage allows the speed of your sword to improve by 5 times, the 2nd stage improves it by 10 times, and the 3rd stage improves it by 30 times! If you’re able to cultivate it to the 3rd stage right now, then even I wouldn’t be able to avoid your attacks!”
