Chapter 1964 – The Invincible Sword Domain!

There were two corpses outside the city, and they’d been chopped into pieces.

They were members of Sky Residence City.

A’Man suddenly asked, “Who killed them?”

Yu Jing shook his head, “I don’t know. They were here early in the morning. They just appeared out of thin air! However, I think it’s the Devil Cave.”

The Devil Cave!

Everyone’s faces fell.

Swish!

Suddenly, a sword howl resounded, and then it vanished into the sky.

Yu Jing spoke solemnly, “That was Yang Ye!”

Qin Chuan asked, “Where’s he going?”

Everyone exchanged glances and remained silent. They gazed at A’Man.

A’Man stood there in silence!

…

Yang Ye left Sky Residence City. His destination was Devil Cave!

The incident between them and the Devil Cave had been caused by him, and he really didn’t want to drag them down because of him. Since he’d caused the trouble, he intended to resolve it himself! FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Devil Cave was on a mountain range over 100,000km away from Sky Residence City, and it was where the devil men converged. Yang Ye stopped when he was around 5,000km away, and then his figure vanished on the spot.

He held a sheathed sword in his grasp!

It didn’t take long for him to sneak into the mountain range, and then he arrived before Devil Cave. Yang Ye noticed numerous corpses outside Devil Cave. There were corpses of humans, wyverns, and some other beasts there.

The devil men ate all of these. The way devil men cultivated was unlike how all of them cultivated. Devil men cultivated by devouring the corpses of others. They devoured the blood, soul, and flesh to strengthen themselves!

Yang Ye would naturally not just attack because that was no different than seeking death.

Wait!

Yang Ye started to wait. He needed to wait until they came outside, and then kill them one by one!

It didn’t take long for a devil man to emerge from within. He glanced at the surroundings and shot towards the distance.

Yang Ye quickly followed after him.

Around 30km away, the devil man seemed to have noticed something and stopped. Right when he stopped, a sword pierced through his forehead.

Hiss!

A string of blood sprayed. The devil man opened his mouth slightly and seemed to want to say something, but a sword instantly chopped off his head.

Yang Ye glanced at the devil man. The devil man before him was at the 2nd stage of the Enlightened Realm. If it was a one on one battle, he would have to exert quite a bit of effort to kill him, but once he hid himself and took his targets by surprise, he became extremely terrifying!

After killing the devil man in an instant, Yang Ye waved his right hand and obliterated the corpse before vanishing on the spot.

Yang Ye arrived outside Devil Cave again, and he started waiting again!

Just like that, time trickled by. In just a few hours, Yang Ye had killed six devil men, and two of them were even at the 3rd stage of the Enlightened Realm while one was even at the 4th stage of the Enlightened Realm. He’d used the Sword Domain to kill the devil man at the 4th stage of the Enlightened Realm.

He would have failed if he hadn’t used the Sword Domain to suppress the fellow!

4th stage Enlightened Realm experts were much stronger than he’d expected!

After they lost around 10 devil men, Devil Cave finally started to react.

A few dozen devil men suddenly flashed out of Devil Cave, and Black Devil led the group.

Black Devil glanced at the surroundings and asked, “Have you found out anything?”

A devil man by Black Devil’s side shook his head, “There has been no movement from Sky Residence City! But it’s definitely them!”

Black Devil fell silent for a long time before he said, “Let’s head back in for now!”

He led the others in once he finished speaking. Around four hours later, a devil man covered beneath a black robe walked outside, and then he vanished into the sky.

It was in the direction of Sky Residence City!

Yang Ye immediately followed after the devil man.

Around 15 minutes later, the devil man suddenly stopped, and then a sword appeared before his nape.

The sword had just appeared there abruptly.

Suddenly, the devil man turned around, and the sword couldn’t move an inch forward. It was because a hand had grabbed its tip, and then the devil man pushed back.

Bang!

Yang Ye was pushed over 3km away!

Meanwhile, the black robe around that devil man vanished.

Black Devil!

It was the leader of Devil Cave, Black Devil!

Yang Ye glanced at the fingerprint on Spiritbreaker’s tip, and then he looked up at Black Devil. The latter waved his right hand, and then 60 devil men suddenly appeared around Yang Ye.

He’d fallen into an ambush!

Even though he’d fallen into an ambush, Yang Ye’s face was extremely calm.

Black Devil sized up Yang Ye, “I thought you would just hide in Sky Residence City. I didn’t expect you to come outside. I’m truly surprised. Of course, it’s pleasant surprise!”

Yang Ye chuckled, “Don’t worry, there are more surprises waiting for you!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he flipped his palm, and Spiritbreaker was swapped for the holy sword. Yang Ye glanced at the devil men around him and said, “Are all of you going to gang up on me or will you fight me one on one?”

“Gang up on you?” Black Devil suddenly started laughing, and he laughed for a while before he shook his head, “Gang up on you? Not to mention you, even the leader of Sky Residence City, A’Man, isn’t worthy of that.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Black Devil suddenly vanished on the spot, and he was in front of Yang Ye when he appeared again. An instant later, a black fist slammed down towards Yang Ye’s head.

It was a very simple punch, and there were no flashy movements!

Yang Ye swung his sword as well!

Bang!

As soon as they came into contact, Yang Ye was blasted away, and he flew over 10km away before finally stopping himself.

Black Devil was in the same realm of cultivation as A’Man. Both of them were in the Know Dao Realm. So, his cultivation was much higher than Yang Ye! It could be said that it was suppression from the gap in their realms of cultivation!”

“Didn’t you want to pleasantly surprise me? Where is it?” Black Devil walked slowly in Yang Ye’s direction, “I hope it’s pleasant and surprising enough. Otherwise, it would be too boring!”

Yang Ye wiped off the blood on the corner of his mouth and smiled, “It’ll definitely be very pleasantly surprising!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye took a step forward, and a wave of mysterious energy instantly appeared here.

The Sword Domain!

The Sword Domain instantly covered the space in a huge area, and the other devil men were enveloped beneath it as well.

“That’s a Domain…” Black Devil glanced at the surroundings, and then he gazed at Yang Ye, “Looks like I underestimated you a little.”

He was about to swing his fist and destroy Yang Ye’s Sword Domain!

However, 36 ethereal swords suddenly appeared in the surroundings.

Once the swords appeared, the expressions of Black Devil and the others changed.

Black Devil’s anxious voice resounded, “Attack!”

As soon as he gave the order, all the other devil men attacked.

Suddenly, the swords started to spin rapidly.

Rays of sword energy crisscrossed and flickered through the surroundings. In an instant, a huge expanse of space was covered in sword energy.

The Invincible Sword Formation!

After he created it that day, Yang Ye had rarely used it. Because it was one of his trump cards. So, he would never use it unless he had to. Now, he planned to put an end to the enmity between him and Devil Cave!

After he joined Sky Residence City, Sky Residence City hadn’t let him down, so he naturally couldn’t let them down. However, people from Sky Residence City had died because of him. While he didn’t know the people who’d died, they’d died because of him!

He had to avenge them!

Sword energy crisscrossed through the surroundings and hissing resounded incessantly.

It was the sound of space being sliced open!

Around 10 breaths of time later, the surroundings gradually calmed down. At this moment, around 40 devil men were left standing.

Besides that, there were around 20 corpses around Yang Ye.

These corpses were covered in holes, and it seemed like they’d been shot by a million arrows. It was absolutely horrifying.

Yang Ye held his sword with both hands while his body bent down slightly. He hadn’t been injured from utilizing his Sword Domain, he’d been heavily injured because the devil men had jointly attacked his Sword Domain.

Black Devil was standing a little bit away from Yang Ye, and his body was covered in injuries. But he was still alive!

Black Devil’s expression was extremely unsightly!

20 devil men! Moreover, there had been three at the 3rd stage of the Enlightened Realm and one at the 4th stage of the Enlightened Realm!

However, all of them had been instantly killed by Yang Ye’s sword formation!

All of them were dead!

Just this battle had caused Devil Cave to suffer heavy losses!

Black Devil stared at Yang Ye, “What an amazing Domain and formation! My Devil Cave has paid such a heavy price for underestimating you. But don’t worry, I won’t let you die that easily. I’ll slowly torture you to death!”

Suddenly, Yang Ye looked up at Black Devil and said, “I can activate that sword formation once more! Do you want to try me?”

The expressions of all the devil men changed.

He could activate it again!

Even though they’d survived, they still had a lingering fear towards that sword formation.

It was horrifying!

“You can activate it again?” Black Devil laughed coldly, “That formation far surpasses your current realm of cultivation. It can be said that you’ve used a force that surpasses your own strength. It’ll definitely make you suffer from backlash. If I’m not wrong, you don’t even have the strength to hold your sword anymore, right?”

As soon as he finished speaking, he was about to attack.

However, a huge spiked club suddenly smashed through the air.

Black Devil’s expression changed slightly. He turned around and swung a punch!

Bang!

Black Devil was pushed over 30m back.

Meanwhile, a person appeared in front of Yang Ye.

A’Man!

It was A’Man!

At the same time, around 50 others appeared around her.

Everyone from Sky Residence City was here!

A’Man ignored Black Devil and gazed at Yang Ye instead. Suddenly, she grabbed his shirt and lifted him up before her, “Do you even treat us as brothers?”
