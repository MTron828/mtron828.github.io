Chapter 2062 – The Evil Treasure!

The blood red palm had appeared out of nowhere, and it was so sudden that Yang Ye hadn’t been able to take any action against it.

Li Shui’shui and Wo You’s expressions changed at the sight of that red palm, and they shot backwards.

They weren’t the only ones, even Han Yi and the other three remaining experts here shot backwards as quickly as they could.

In an instant, they’d vanished on the spot.

Only Yang Ye remained here.

It wasn’t that Yang Ye refused to flee, he couldn’t.

He couldn’t move!

In the beginning, Yang Ye thought the blood red palm wanted to kill him, but it didn’t take long for him to realize that it wasn’t the case. Because his head had felt like it was about to explode, but once that blood red palm descended onto his head, his head had calmed down.

The feeling like it was about to explode had just vanished mysteriously! ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

What’s going on?

Yang Ye was stunned, but it didn’t take long for him to think of a certain thing.

The evil treasure!

He knew that the palm definitely belonged to the evil treasure, and it was helping him! But why was it helping him?

Questions filled Yang Ye’s mind.

Suddenly, a ball of red light appeared not too far before Yang Ye.

Yang Ye’s heart shook. As expected, it’s the evil treasure.

The ball of red light stopped after arriving around 30m away from the door, and then a voice came from within the red light, “You’re really smart to have been able to instantly notice how extraordinary he is. If you wanted to kill him, I wouldn’t be against it. However, you actually want to take his body and take his karmic luck!”

Suddenly, footsteps came from behind the door.

Yang Ye focused his gaze. A strange demon beast walked out from behind the door. It was slightly like a bird, but it had no wings. It merely had extremely long legs and wide feet that were shaped like fans. Something else worth mentioning was its mouth, it was sharp and extremely long like a needle. As for its eyes, they were pitch black like two small black holes.

What the heck is that? Yang Ye’s frown deepened.

Suddenly, the demon beast opened its mouth and tried to bite the ball of red light. Obviously, it planned to swallow the ball of red light whole.

Even though it was just a simple action, Yang Ye noticed that its speed was shockingly fast. While he’d seen it move, he was very well aware that he wouldn’t be able to dodge it and could only go head-on against such an attack!

Suddenly, a blood red hand emerged from the ball of red light, and it pressed against the tip of the demon beast’s mouth.

Bang!

The ball of red light was blasted behind him, and the demon beast was blasted back through the door.

Yang Ye’s face was extremely solemn. What is that demon beast? It was actually able to blast the evil treasure back!Meanwhile, the demon beast emerged from within the door again. Yang Ye’s eyelids twitched from the sight of this, and he shot backwards. At the same time, the demon beast suddenly charged at him.

Yang Ye was alarmed and swung his sword.

Hiss!

A ray of sword energy rapidly tore through the air and instantly struck the demon beast.

Bang!

However, the sword energy exploded apart, and the demon beast was completely unharmed.

What the hell is that physical defense? Yang Ye was shocked. Meanwhile, the demon beast had arrived in front of him, and then Yang Ye sensed a wave of terrifying energy sweep towards him. Suddenly, a blood red hand appeared in front of him, and then it slapped forward.

Bang!

The beast was blasted back to the door.

Suddenly, a furious shout resounded in Yang Ye’s ears, “What are you still doing here?”

Yang Ye was stunned for a moment, and then he turned around and fled.

Screech!

Suddenly, an ear-piercing screech resounded, and then Yang Ye’s figure stiffened. A moment later, he bled from all seven apertures, and his head even started to crack.

Roar!

A dragon roar resounded.

The Sky Dragon!

Once he had the Sky Dragon around him, Yang Ye felt much better. He didn’t dare stay here a moment longer and immediately transformed into a ray of light that shot off into the distance.

But right when Yang Ye was about to charge out of the mysterious ruins, the beast appeared before the exit at the top of the place.

Yang Ye’s face fell at the sight of this. Its speed was much faster than his own. So even if he used the Divine Wings, he couldn’t compete with it in speed.

He couldn’t escape!

Yang Ye was quite surprised because the demon beast didn’t attack him again and just gazed at him. Obviously, it was afraid of the evil treasure.

Meanwhile, the evil treasure didn’t attack, and so they fell into a stalemate.

Yang Ye thought for a moment and said, “I think we can all sit down and talk about it. Peace is important, right?”

“It wants to kill you! You go talk with it!” A cold voice resounded in Yang Ye’s mind.

It was the evil treasure!

Yang Ye spoke in a low voice, “Why?”

The evil treasure replied indifferently, “You have that thing in your possession, and that represents great karmic luck. It can sense that karmic luck. However, that animal doesn’t realize that it’ll die with you if it tries to take your body. Because it doesn’t know how powerful that thing is, and it only knows that thing represents karmic luck. So, it wants that thing.”

The Primordial Pagoda!

Yang Ye knew that the evil treasure was speaking about the Primordial Pagoda. It wasn’t just that demon beast, even the evil treasure wanted the Primordial Pagoda. The only difference was that the evil treasure knew how powerful the Primordial pagoda was, and the demon beast didn’t.

So, he was in a difficult situation.

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings and asked, “What do I do now?”

He was naturally asking the evil treasure.

It replied indifferently, “I don’t know!”

“You can’t defeat it?” Yang Ye was quite surprised. As far as he was concerned, the evil treasure was extremely formidable and didn’t even fear the progenitors. So, how could it not be formidable?

The evil treasure replied with a question, “Why should I risk my life against it?”

Yang Ye was stunned. Right, why should it risk its life against that demon beast?

I have to rely on myself! Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings, and his gaze stopped on the door. There may be a path out from there, but it also may be a dead end. Regardless of which it was, it was a path he had to take.

Because there was no other path besides that one!

Yang Ye looked up at the demon beast. The space around it had started to tremble. Obviously, it wouldn’t be able to stop itself from attacking him for long.

Yang Ye took a step back and waved both hands. In an instant, a few dozen ethereal swords appeared here, and then a mysterious wave of energy appeared.

The Sword Domain!

“Annihilate!” Yang Ye’s voice resounded, and then the ethereal swords transformed into rays of light that shot at the demon beast.

As for Yang Ye’s figure, it transformed into a ray of light that shot towards the door. The ethereal swords were there to keep the demon beast busy for a moment, so Yang Ye was able to smoothly pass through the door and arrive at the world beyond it.

There was an endless passageway in front of Yang Ye. He didn’t hesitate to shoot towards its depths. At the same time, rays of sword energy flashed out from him and shot behind him.

The demon beast was charging madly at him from behind. While Yang Ye’s sword energy couldn’t harm it, they were still able to create a little bit of obstruction, and just that bit allowed Yang Ye to vanish into the depths of the passageway.

Bang!

The demon beast suddenly stopped and looked off into the distance while viciousness filled its eyes. It started howling madly, but Yang Ye didn’t even look back.

A spacious hall was at the end of the passageway, and it flickered with multicolored light. Multicolored gems studded the walls of the hall.

It wasn’t just the walls, even the grounds had gems in them!

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings, and then looked up. There was a crystal casket there.

A casket!

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment before walking over. He arrived before it and saw that it was made from mysterious gems. But because it was covered, he couldn’t see what was inside.

Moreover, Yang Ye noticed that his divine sense couldn’t enter the casket!

Open it?

Yang Ye was hesitant. He was very curious because it may be someone from the prehistoric civilization that was resting within it, but he was very clearly aware that curiosity killed the cat.

As for the demon beast, Yang Ye noticed that it hadn’t pursued him. It seemed to be afraid of something, but it didn’t leave and just roared angrily at Yang Ye.

Yang Ye knew that it was definitely afraid of something and didn’t dare to enter the hall.

He withdrew his gaze and sized up the surroundings. In the end, his gaze descended on the walls. There was a stellar map on the wall, and it was different from all the other maps outside.

Yang Ye walked over to it and looked up at it. There were countless thumb-sized black dots on it, and all of them represented planets. In the end, his gaze arrived at the center of the map. There was a huge planet there, and it was aqua blue.

Suddenly, a voice resounded, “That was once our home!”

Yang Ye was stunned, and then he turned around and gazed at the casket.

Crack!

Its lid suddenly started moving slowly.
