Chapter 2336 – The True Dao Realm!

If you want to fight, then fight we shall!

His voice rumbled like a thunderclap through the clouds.

Godless Heaven’s eyes narrowed slightly, “They were right, you must die.”

“Brother Godless Heaven!” Suddenly, White Emperor spoke abruptly, “We haven’t met in a long time, so let’s have a long chat.”

He waved his right hand once he finished speaking.

Bang!

The entire layer of clouds in the sky was obliterated.

White Emperor and Godless Heaven vanished on the spot!

Obviously, White Emperor had decided to act in the end. However, he left some room to maneuver. If he didn’t help and Godless Heaven acted against Yang Ye, then Yang Ye would have no chance, not even the chance to flee!

But if Godless Heaven couldn’t act against Yang Ye, then the latter would have a tiny chance!

Yang Ye closed his eyes slowly, and then a faint red light arose around him. Meanwhile, a droplet of blood was ceaselessly flowing around Invincible.

Slaughter!

Actually, Yang Ye’s slaughter intent was more suited to his saber and not his sword.

After all, the saber in his grasp was a saber of slaughter.

Bang!

Meanwhile, a terrifying aura pressed down from above, and it seemed like the sky was collapsing. It was absolutely suffocating.

Using the aura to pressure him!

Yang Ye suddenly stomped his right foot down.

Bang!

The space beneath his feet collapsed, and he transformed into a ray of blood red light that shot up into the sky. After that, a ray of saber energy shot down from above.

Life Isolation!

The saber energy was over 3km long, and it slashed through everything in its path as it shot down.

Boom!

A dazzling ray of golden light suddenly flashed out from a point in space, and then it shot up into the air toward Yang Ye’s saber energy.

Boom!

As soon as they collided, they exploded apart, and the aftershock of their collision rippled through the world.

An old man and Yang Ye stood in confrontation from afar in midair!

The old man was the same Half-Step World Lord from the Immortal Estate who’d been driven away by White Emperor earlier.

Once they knew how strong Yang Ye was, the Immortal Estate would naturally not be foolish enough to send True World Realm experts. It could be said that besides Half-Step World Lords, even True World Realm would only be giving their lives away if they fought Yang Ye.

However, the old man’s face was solemn right now. Because he noticed that the young man before him was much stronger than he’d expected!

Suddenly, the old man’s pupils constricted, and a ray of blood red light flashed before his eyes.

It was Yang Ye!

The old man squatted down slightly, and then he flipped both his palms upward.

Bang!

In an instant, the space before him was lifted up, and then the blood red saber energy which had just arrived before him was flipped up as well. A moment later, he twisted his right hand!

Bang!

He slammed a punch forward, and an energy fist surged out. Everywhere it passed, space was obliterated, inch by inch. At the same time, the powerful energy it emanated instantly caused the sky to tremble violently.

Bang!

An explosion resounded, and then a figure was blasted away.

It was Yang Ye’s figure!

Once he pushed Yang Ye back, the old man didn’t stop. His figure vanished on the spot.

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!

Once he vanished, the entire sky was torn open in layers. The rifts grew larger and larger, and their target was Yang Ye’s position.

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly. He took Invincible in both hands as he took half a step forward with his right foot, and then he stomped it down.

Hiss! DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

A ray of blood red light flashed.

“Slash!” A furious howl resounded in the sky, and then a dazzling ray of blood red saber energy flashed down like a bolt of lightning.

Boom!

As soon as it descended, the space in the sky collapsed and was obliterated. Meanwhile, Yang Ye’s expression changed because numerous strands of powerful energy were surging toward him from the surroundings.

In the black hole, Yang Ye raised Invincible slowly with both hands, and then he swung it down.

Bang!

A deafening explosion resounded, and then Yang Ye was blasted away again. At the instant that happened, the old man appeared within his vision again.

The old man glanced coldly at Yang Ye’s flying figure, and then a golden flying blade suddenly appeared in his right grasp. An instant later, it shook violently and transformed into a ray of golden light that shot at Yang Ye.

Yang Ye was shocked because he sensed a strong sense of danger coming from it.

He didn’t dare to act carelessly!

Yang Ye’s profound energy circulated madly. At the same time, his Profound Primal Energy circulated madly too. It didn’t take long for his profound energy, Profound Primal Energy, and slaughter intent to surge into the saber.

Meanwhile, the golden flying blade had arrived before him!

Yang Ye raised his saber with both hands and chopped down.

Clang!

An ear piercing explosion resounded!

Crack!

A moment of silence ensued, and then Yang Ye’s arms suddenly cracked open, causing blood to spray. At the same time, his figure was blasted away with his saber.

Swoosh!

Meanwhile, the golden flying blade shot after Yang Ye again.

At this moment, the space in the surroundings had been repaired by some sort of Laws. However, once the flying blade shot through it, the newly repaired space actually collapsed, inch by inch, again…

Everything was blasted into bits!

Yang Ye stomped his right foot down and stopped in midair.

He closed his eyes slowly as he gazed at the flying blade that was shooting at him, and then he suddenly placed his right hand on his waist when it arrived just around 3m away.

Swoosh!

An expanse of light rippled forth!

Hidden Blade!

At this instant, 100 rays of saber energy slammed against the flying blade.

Madness Saber Technique!

The reason he used Hidden Blade was that he was utterly incapable of using Madness Saber Technique with Invincible. It stressed upon speed, but Invincible stressed upon power. Most importantly, he wasn’t able to fully control Invincible yet.

While he didn’t have the madness intent anymore, the attack had forcefully stopped the golden flying blade!

But it wasn’t easy for Yang Ye because his arms were trembling right now!

Suddenly, another ray of golden light flashed.

Yang Ye’s expression changed drastically. He stomped his right foot down and moved 300m back. Meanwhile, a ray of golden light had arrived before him!

Another flying blade!

Yang Ye swung Hidden Blade madly with his right hand.

Bang! Bang! Bang!

Explosions resounded incessantly, but every single explosion pushed Yang Ye at least 300m back. Just like that, it took less than a breath of time for Yang Ye to be pushed almost 10km away by the flying blades!

Once he stopped himself, a wisp of blood seeped out from the corner of Yang Ye’s mouth.

The old man raised his palms, and the two golden flying blades immediately appeared there.

They just floated quietly above his palms.

The old man gazed at Yang Ye and spoke indifferently, “Yang Ye, do you know what they are?”

Yang Ye looked up at the old man, wiped off the blood on the corner of his mouth, and remained silent.

The old man laughed coldly, “These two flying blades were made from the bones of a Primal True Dragon. They are unbreakable, and they possess the strength of the Primal True Dragon. Such power isn’t something a tiny Progenitor like you can resist! Right, aren’t you strongest with the sword? Come, let me see if your sword can stop this move of mine.”

As soon as he finished speaking, two strands of golden light surged out from within him and entered the flying blades. A moment later, they shook violently and transformed into rays of golden light that shot at Yang Ye.

Hiss! Hiss!

Two long rays of golden light appeared in the sky. Everywhere they passed, space couldn’t endure them at all and was instantly obliterated.

However, Yang Ye still showed no intent to draw his sword.

Suddenly, a white and fluffy little head emerged from Yang Ye’s chest!

Snowy!

Snowy gazed at the golden flying blades, blinked, and then stretched out her paws.

The old man frowned as he wondered what the heck Yang Ye was doing!

The flying blades grew closer and closer, but Yang Ye still showed no intent to attack. However, he clearly had his guard up, and powerful fluctuations of energy were rippling around him.

Just like that, the blades arrived before Yang Ye and Snowy.

After that, everyone watched with astonishment as they stopped just an inch away from Yang Ye’s forehead. Meanwhile, a pair of paws grabbed them!

Everyone was stunned by this scene, including the old man!

Snowy glanced at the blades in her grasp, and then she struck them together.

Clang! Clang!

They emanated two strands of golden energy, but they didn’t harm Snowy at all.

Snowy played with them for a moment, and then she put them by her waist and fled into the Primordial Pagoda.

The old man was stunned on the spot.

The old man wasn’t the only one, all the experts in the surroundings were stunned.

Those two flying blades were gone just like that?

“Impossible!” Meanwhile, a ferocious expression appeared on the old man’s face, “Impossible! That’s impossible! I spent almost 100 years nourishing them. They became one with me a long time ago. They would never betray me, never! You…”

Suddenly, Yang Ye appeared in front of the old man. At this moment, the Hidden Blade had been exchanged for the Sword Supreme! At the same time, the Sword Gourd on Yang Ye’s waist suddenly emanated a wave of powerful sword intent that surged into Yang Ye’s body!

Boom!

A wave of powerful sword intent suddenly swept out from Yang Ye and surged into the Sword Supreme.

True Dao Realm sword intent!

Moreover, a powerful aura surged out of Yang Ye with the sword intent.

The Sword Domain!

Yang Ye’s attack hadn’t even descended fully when another attack descended!

Two attacks!

Two overlapped attacks!

Bang!

As soon as his sword descended, the space in a huge area collapsed.

An expanse of pitch black filled the surroundings!

The old man was astounded, and disbelief filled his eyes. He didn’t have the time to think, so two golden scales immediately appeared above him. At the same time, countless rays of golden light surged out from him.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye’s attack descended.

Bang!

The scales above him shattered while the golden light around him collapsed as well. After that, the old man was blasted flying.

In the air, his body collapsed, inch by inch, and it took just an instant for just his soul to remain!

The surroundings fell silent.

A moment of silence ensued before a low voice resounded, “That isn’t the Progenitor Realm, it’s the True Dao Realm…”
