Chapter 2583

Intent Ignition!

It was a move Yang Ye had learned a very, very long time ago, and he practically never used it. Because it harmed him more than it harmed his enemies.

There was one other reason why he hadn’t used it in a very, very long time, and it was because it had been that long since he’d ever truly risked his life in battle.

In the past, he had nothing to fear!

Now, he had nothing to rely on!

If he didn’t fight with his life on the line, he would definitely lose it!

Of course, even then, he didn’t have any chance to survive. But he still chose to do it!

Fight!

At this moment, Yang Ye used Intent Ignition to fully release his potential, and it brought him to his limits in all aspects!

However, Yang Ye was quite puzzled by the fact that his Intent Ignition felt different than when he’d used it in the past!

As for what was different, he didn’t have the time to think about it.

After he ignited it, the Sword Domain formed around Yang Ye!

Boundless sword energy and sword intent converged around him!

The Sword Domain Sphere!

It was one of his ultimate moves. He hadn’t used it earlier because the time wasn’t tight. Now, she was right before him, and she knew victory was within her grasp. So, it could be said that this was the moment she was the most relaxed, and it was the moment her guard was the laxest!

Sure enough, the woman’s expression changed when the Sword Domain Sphere formed!

It was the first time her expression had changed because it was the first time she’d sensed danger from the man before her!

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!

The Sword Domain Sphere sliced everything apart!

In an instant, the cold winds she emanated were sliced into bits. At the same time, her body was sliced by countless rays of sword energy and sword intent!

She was almost sliced into bits!

However, at the instant before that happened, she’d moved 300m away. Moreover, a gust of cold wind enveloped her tightly and stopped her body from collapsing.

At this moment, her face was extremely unsightly!

Absolutely unsightly!

She’d almost died when victory had been almost guaranteed!

If she had been vigilant and slightly careful just now, all of this wouldn’t have happened. Unfortunately, she’d acted just as Yang Ye expected. At that moment, victory had been within her grasp, or it should be said that she’d never taken Yang Ye seriously.

However, she hadn’t expected Yang Ye to be hiding such a powerful move!

She didn’t attack again because she had to keep her body intact and guarantee its recovery.

There were too many people and things she had to worry about in this place!

As for Yang Ye, Yang Ye was lying on the ground after using the Sword Domain Sphere. He couldn’t move at all. That had been his final attack.

His attack that carried everything he had!

Yang Ye was truly exhausted right now!

Suddenly, an old man appeared here. Yang Ye knew the old man, it was the old man who’d stopped him at the critical moment during his battle with the saber-wielding young man and took the young man away!

The old man glanced at the woman, “Madam Yin, you’re the wife of the Yin World’s Master, so you can be considered to be an overlord of an area. Aren’t you going a little too far by treating a young man at the Lord Realm like this?”

Madam Yin laughed coldly, “What? When did the Demon Blade Sect like to interfere in the business of others?”

The old man glanced at Yang Ye and said, “He fought my disciple before. It was a fair fight, but I interfered, and that was wrong of me. So, I want to save his life and eliminate the guilt I feel.”

Madam Yin pointed at Yang Ye, “His life is mine.”

The old man said, “Do as you want. I’m just rescuing him this one time.”

He picked up Yang Ye from the ground and walked away.

Madam Yin didn’t do anything because her body hadn’t fully healed yet. If she attacked now, it would be very unwise. Of course, the old man may have not helped Yang Ye if she remained completely unharmed.

Just like that, the old man vanished from her vision with Yang Ye.

Madam Yin gazed coldly into the distance, “Damn ant!”

She suddenly looked to the side at this point. A young girl was standing to her right by the edge of the bridge. The young girl was standing there while constantly bouncing a rattan ball.

Madam Yin’s face instantly turned solemn from the sight of the young girl.

Because she hadn’t noticed when the young girl had appeared there. Moreover, even now, she couldn’t sense the young girl’s presence!

It was too strange!

She was Qi Bitian, of course!

Madam Yin stared at Qi Bitian, “Who are you?”

Qi Bitian glanced at Madam Yin, “Hurry up and restore your body. It’s boring for me if I kill you just like this.”

She continued kicking her ball.

Madam Yin laughed coldly upon hearing her, “Kill me? Such high-sounding sentiments!”

Qi Bitian continued kicking her ball, “I have a question. So, does bullying the weak make you that happy?”

Madam Yin glanced at Qi Bitian and smiled, “I see, so you’re that ant’s senior?”

“His senior?” Qi bitian blinked, “Yes, I am.”

Madam Yin chuckled, “What? You want to stand up for him?”

Qi Bitian shook her head, “I never planned to interfere. Even if you killed him, I wouldn’t interfere. He’s an adult, and he has to take responsibility for his own actions. If you really killed him just now, I would just leave, and I wouldn’t avenge him. Someone else will do the avenging.”

Madam Yin ridiculed, “Then what are you doing here now?”

Qi Bitian cracked a smile, “Because I had an agreement with him. Even if he’s in danger, I wouldn’t save him. Now, he’s safe for now. So, doing this doesn’t violate our agreement. After all, I’m not rescuing him. Of course, I’m here mainly because I can’t stand the sight of you. Is that a good enough reason?”

“You can’t stand the sight of me?” Madam Yin roared with laughter. She laughed for a while before looking at Qi Bitian, “To be honest, many throughout the myriad of worlds and Eternal Kingdom can’t stand the sight of me, so who do you think you are?”

Qi Bitian glanced at her, and then she swung her palm forward.

Slap!

A clear and resounding slap arose, and Madam Yin was blasted 3km away.

At this moment, Madam Yin was stunned.

Madam Yin’s face was covered in disbelief as she lay there on the ground 3km away. She swiftly turned to look over at Qi Bitian, and she noticed that the young girl was still on her right!

At this moment, Madam Yin’s eyes were filled with fear.

Meanwhile, Qi Bitian waved her palm again. At this moment, Madam Yin was ready, so countless gusts of cold wind converged around her. However, as Qi Bitian’s palm moved, the cold wind instantly vanished without a trace. An instant later, there was another palm print on Madam Yin’s face.

Slap!

Another clear and resounding slap!

Madam Yin was swung to the ground, and even the bridge shook because of it!

At this moment, Madam Yin was utterly stunned!

She couldn’t fight back at all!

She actually noticed that she couldn’t fight back at all!

It was utterly impossible!

A fierce glow flashed on her face, and then countless waves of cold wind shot at the young girl like blades. If she’d used such a move against Yang Ye, Yang Ye would have died a long time ago!

Yet now, she was facing Qi Bitian!

This young girl who was even greater than the heavens!

Qi Bitian waved her right hand lightly.

It was like an autumn breeze blowing leaves away, and the cold winds vanished without a trace!

Madam Yin’s eyes were filled with terror from the sight of this!

Extreme terror!

The young girl before her was far beyond anything she knew!

Qi Bitian glanced at the surroundings, “This place isn’t bad. It can endure my body. But it can’t take it for too long, so I have to head back immediately.”

She gazed at Madam Yin, “You haven’t answered my question. Does bullying the weak please you?”

Madam Yin stared at Qi Bitian, “W-Who are you?”

Qi Bitian smiled, “Go figure!”

How could Madam Yin possibly guess the answer? She stood up and gazed coldly at Qi Bitian, “Do your worst!”

Meanwhile, Qi Bitian waved her hand casually again.

Slap!

A clear and loud slap resounded, and Madam Yin was slapped to the ground.

Madam Yin looked up and glared at Qi Bitian, and she howled with fury, “Why do you humiliate me like this?!”

Qi Bitian smiled, “If you just killed him earlier, I wouldn’t have shown myself. But you didn’t. You humiliated him. Now, how does it feel to be humiliated in return?”

Madam Yin’s face was extremely unsightly at this moment.

Qi Bitian walked over to her, looked down at Madam Yin, and smiled, “I couldn’t stand to watch what you were doing, so I wanted to humiliate you too. Do you have a problem with that?”

Madam Yin gazed at Qi Bitian while the killing intent in her eyes was simply material!

She’s lived for many years, but she’d never been treated like this!

Qi Bitian glanced at the end of the bridge, “I can watch him die, and I can stop everyone from saving him, and I can even kill him myself. Because I don’t want Erya and Snowy to be with someone useless.”

She looked down at Madam Yin and continued, “But he didn’t disappoint me, so I won’t let anyone humiliate him. Especially someone who’s bullying him with a far superior cultivation! It just so happens that he didn’t disappoint me. Death isn’t terrifying, it’s living in humiliation that is terrifying. I would rather die than live like that.”

As soon as she finished speaking, Qi Bitian kicked forward as if she was kicking a ball.

Bang!

Madam Yin’s head was kicked away, and it flew far, far away…

“Sigh!” Meanwhile, a sigh came from far away in the sky, “You’re broken the rules.” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Qi Bitian looked up at the sky, “Shut up and fuck off!”
