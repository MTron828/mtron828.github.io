Chapter 1600 - The Strongest Amongst The Ten Nether Halls!

Translator: InVader

Yang Ye wasn’t the only one who was caught slightly off guard by the arrival, Little Sky was stunned as well. Obviously, she hadn’t expected someone would be able to arrive by her side without making a sound.

Yang Ye was the first to recover from his shock, and he immediately drew his sword and swung it at one of them.

Om!

A sword howl resounded, and then a wave of sword energy flashed by.

The shadowy figure didn’t try to dodge Yang Ye’s sword energy, and the figure just allowed Yang Ye’s sword energy to pass through.

Once it passed through the figure, the shadowy figure shook slightly but remained completely unharmed!

Yang Ye’s pupils constricted slightly at the sight of this, and a trace of disbelief appeared in his eyes. He hadn’t held back just now, but the shadowy figure was completely unharmed!

Suddenly, an earthen yellow wave of energy surged out from Little Sky, and then the golden chains were instantly blasted into bits. After that, Little Sky’s figure shook and vanished on the spot. She was by Yang Ye’s side when she appeared again.

Yang Ye hurriedly asked, “Are you alright?”

Little Sky shook her head slightly, “I have Little Mud protecting me. Ordinary people won’t be able to harm me while I’m protected by the energy of the earth.”

Yang Ye glanced at Little Sky. Sure enough, there was a layer of earthen yellow energy around her. Meanwhile, Yang Ye seemed to have thought of something. He turned to look towards the distance, but there was no one there.

Yang Ye frowned, “What’s going on?”

Little Sky spoke softly, “Their movement technique is quite special.”

Yang Ye asked, “They haven’t left, right?”

Little Sky nodded, and then she gazed at Yang Ye, “You can locate them.”

Yang Ye was slightly stunned, and then he understood what she meant.

The Sword Domain!

All movement techniques were useless within the Sword Domain!

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings, and then he activated the Sword Domain. As soon as he did that, numerous rays of cold light suddenly appeared in the surroundings, and they enveloped Yang Ye before he could even react.

Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!

Rumbling resounded.

A few breaths of time later, the surroundings returned to calm once more. At this moment, Yang Ye was still on the spot, but there was cold sweat on his forehead.

He’d almost died just now. If Little Sky hadn’t enveloped him with the energy of the earth at the critical moment, then he would have really died. The strength of those shadowy figures wasn’t something he could resist with his body!

Little Sky stuck out her tongue at him, “Sorry, I almost forgot about their strength.”

Yang Ye replied with a solemn expression on his face, “They’re really strong!”

Little Sky nodded, “The Nether Pavilion has numerous experts.” She patted her own chest and continued, “Little Mud, you deal with those five fellows.”

As soon as Little Sky finished speaking, a small earthen yellow ball instantly appeared in front of her, and then the space in an area of 30km was instantly enveloped by a layer of earthen yellow energy.

At the same time, the five shadowy figures appeared not too far away from them. They’d been forced out into the open by the energy of earth!

Yang Ye sized up the figures. If he wasn’t wrong, they were the five Nether Phantoms that Blood Maiden had told him about.

Suddenly, they vanished on the spot, and they were around Yang Ye and Little Sky when they appeared again. After that, five rays of cold light instantly enveloped them. Meanwhile, an earthen yellow pillar of light suddenly surged out from Little Sky like a storm.

Bang!

The five shadowy figures were blasted over 1km away.

Suddenly, the space high above trembled, and then the violet armored woman and the young boy walked out from there.

At this moment, the gazes of everyone here had descended upon them.

The armored woman glanced at the boy, “Not bad indeed. But it’s far from enough.”

The boy nodded slightly, and then he gazed at Little Sky, “I’ve lost!”

Yang Ye’s heart shook when he heard this. He hadn’t expected that the young boy would actually lose!

Little Sky shook her head slightly, “You’ve tried your best.”

The boy grinned, and then he flipped his palm. A rock appeared at the center of his palm. A gentle expression appeared in his eyes as he gazed at the rock.

Little Sky spoke softly, “That’s her, right?”

He nodded, “When you came to see us, her time was actually up.” He passed it over to Little Sky while he spoke.

Little Sky took it and said, “What…”

The boy grinned, “She’s gone. So what’s the point of living?” As he spoke, he turned to look at the armored woman, “Little Sky, I’m sorry. I’m unable to help you resolve this problem that you’re facing. But I can still help you one last time.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he suddenly looked up at the rock in Little Sky’s grasp, “I’ve cultivated for nine lifetimes, and I should have gained enlightenment and surpassed the shackles on me. However, if I don’t have you by my side, then even eternal life is pointless!”

As soon as he finished speaking, faint flames appeared on him!

Soul ignition!

Yang Ye’s expression changed at the sight of this, and the armored woman’s expression changed as well. Obviously, she hadn’t expected him to choose to ignite his soul!

What did it represent?

It represented that the boy would truly vanish from this world, and he would even have the chance to reincarnate!

Little Sky’s expression changed at the sight of this, and she said, “Don’t…”

The boy suddenly interrupted Little Sky, “Little Sky, this is my choice. As far as I’m concerned, it’s the best outcome for me. Once I’m dead, place both of us somewhere in an ocean. She loved the ocean.”

Bang!

As soon as he finished speaking, a terrifying aura suddenly erupted from within him, and then he gazed at the armored woman. He didn’t speak a single word, and he just stretched out his hands and pulled outwards. The space where he and the armored woman were standing was instantly torn open, and then they vanished on the spot.

Yang Ye gazed at Little Sky, “Where did they go?” DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Little Sky remained silent for a long time before she said, “A black hole!”

“A black hole?” Yang Ye frowned. He was about to speak when the space far away from them suddenly trembled, and then a woman walked out from there. It was the armored woman from before.

Yang Ye noticed that there was a wisp of blood on the corner of her mouth. Moreover, her arms had actually vanished. Blood was surging out incessantly from where her arms were. Besides that, there were dozens of injuries throughout her body, and they were bleeding as well. She seemed to be completely covered in blood.

Meanwhile, a thumb-sized rock suddenly flashed out from the space in front of Little Sky. It floated down slowly and descended before Little Sky.

Little Sky was stunned on the spot when she saw the rock.

Yang Ye fell silent. Obviously, it was the young boy, and he’d truly vanished from this world.

Meanwhile, the armored woman suddenly gazed at Little Sky, “You really surprised me. I never expected such an expert to be willing to ignite his soul just to help you. Needless to say, I’m truly surprised.”

Little Sky didn’t speak. She just gazed at the rocks for a long time, and then she spoke softly, “Don’t worry, I’ll find a quiet place for both of you so that you can be together forever and never be separated!”

Bang!

Suddenly, the starry sky above them shook violently, and then Qin and Fan Yinyu appeared.

At this moment, both of them were quite pale.

Little Sky walked over to Qin’s side and spoke softly, “Are you alright?”

Qin shook her head, “It doesn’t hurt that much.”

Little Sky rubbed Qin’s head gently, and then she turned to look at the armored woman’s group, “So your Nether Pavilion likes to do this, huh? My Merak System will play with you today.”

As soon as she finished speaking, she waved her right hand. In an instant, an Eye of the Heaven Dao appeared in the starry sky above them. Once the first appeared, a second appeared right after. In just a few breaths of time, around 50 huge Eyes of the Heaven Dao had appeared in outer space.

The armored woman glanced at them. She was naturally very well aware of the strength they possessed, and she knew that their strength far surpassed Rebirth Realm experts.

The armored woman gazed at them for a long time, and then she gazed at Little Sky, “My Nether Pavilion is willing to give you one last chance. So long as you don’t resist, leave with us, and make these Eyes of the Heaven Dao assist our Nether Pavilion in managing Merak System, then my Nether Pavilion can spare everyone. Otherwise, everyone who’s fighting against my Nether Pavilion with you today shall die!”

Little Sky laughed coldly, “Everyone will die? Such confidence. Let me tell you something. I, Little Sky, dislike fighting, but it doesn’t mean that I’m afraid of fighting. From this moment onward, I, Little Sky, officially declare war against your Nether Pavilion. I’m going to make your lousy pavilion vanish from this world!”

As soon as she finished speaking, she looked up at the Eyes of the Heaven Dao and waved her hand, “Strike her! Strike her to death!”

Bang! Bang! Bang!

In an instant, countless bolts of divine lightning descended towards the armored woman.

The armored woman gazed coldly at Little Sky, “Since you want to die, then we’ll fulfil your wish!”

She waved her right hand once she finished speaking.

A moment of silence ensued, and then a huge mouth suddenly appeared above them. After that, the huge mouth instantly swallowed all the divine lightning. At the same time, one of the Eyes of the Heaven Dao was instantly swallowed by the huge mouth!

The strongest amongst the ten Nether Halls! Sky Maiden was here!
