Chapter 2593

Yang Ye was very well aware that the Eternal Kingdom was definitely behind all of this.

They knew he was here, and so they wanted to keep him here!

They refused to let him live!

The Ascetic led Yang Ye to a place called the Sky Palace.

The Sky Palace was like the manager of this place, and they were in charge of the disputes here.

After all, many people didn’t want this place to become a battlefield as it wasn’t in line with their interests. So, the Sky Palace was born.

The Sky Palace was built by the bridge, and it floated above the Boundless Water.

They arrived before the Sky Palace, and an old man appeared before them.

The old man glanced at Yang Ye, “Yang Ye?”

Yang Ye was quite surprised, “You recognize me?”

The old man replied indifferently, “I’ve heard of you. You’re here for the teleportation formation?”

Yang Ye nodded.

The old man shook his head, “My Sky Palace refuses to interfere in it. So leave!”

He turned around and walked away.

Yang Ye suddenly asked, “Why?”

The old man stopped, “You should know why!”

Yang Ye smiled, “What? The powers of Eternal Kingdom are already able to make this place do as they wish?”

The old man turned around and glanced at Yang Ye, “The powers of Eternal Kingdom cannot do that, but at most times, it isn’t bad for us to give them some face. To be a little more direct, we have no need to give you face, but we do need to give them face. Understand?”

The old man turned around and vanished on the spot.

The Ascetic shook his head, “Looks like Eternal Kingdom really paid a huge price! Even the Sky Palace has chosen not to interfere!”

Yang Ye smiled, “Looks like I have no other choice!”

The Ascetic spoke solemnly, “Don’t be rash, Brother Yang. It’s obvious they want you to cause trouble because it’ll give them an excuse to kill you!”

Yang Ye smiled, “Senior, haven’t you realized? No matter what I do, they will still act against me. They haven’t attacked yet because Eternal Kingdom and the Soul Sect want to do it themselves, or perhaps they haven’t discussed how to split the gains. Or maybe it’s something else. But no matter what it is, it’ll end with them attacking me.”

The Ascetic hesitated for a moment and sighed softly. He’d realized how unusual this thing was. After all, the entire Eternal Kingdom was targeting Yang Ye!

Yang Ye smiled, “Farewell, Senior! We’ll meet again if fate wills it!”

Yang Ye vanished into the distance.

The Ascetic shook his head slightly and left.

Yang Ye left the Sky Palace and arrived on the bridge again. He gazed at the Boundless Water below in silence.

What should he do now?

Kill his way out?

If he were being honest, he didn’t have the strength to accomplish that. While his strength had risen tremendously, his enemies were far stronger!

But what else could he do? Stay and cultivate here?

Suddenly, a black clothed man appeared before Yang Ye.

The man cupped his fist to Yang Ye and said, “According to the latest information we received, the Eternal Kingdom and the Soul Sect have started to act against the Ancient Sword Sect.”

Yang Ye glanced at him, “Who are you?”

The black clothed man shook his head, “You have no need for that information. If you don’t leave this place in two days at most, the Ancient Sword Sect will cease to exist!”

The black clothed man turned around and vanished on the spot.

Yang Ye remained silent on the spot.

After the black clothed man left, he went to the Divine Abode. At the third floor, he took a knee before a middle aged man, “Patriarch, I’ve given him the news!”

It was the Desolate Emperor!

The Desolate Emperor nodded slightly, “You may leave!”

The black clothed man vanished on the spot.

The Desolate Emperor walked over to the window and gazed at the bridge in the distance. He smiled, “Cause trouble, the greater the better.”

Suddenly, a voice resounded, “Desolate Emperor, when did you start playing such tricks?”

Only a voice could be heard but not its owner.

The Desolate Emperor shook his head, “I’m not scheming against him. I merely told him the Eternal Kingdom and Soul Sect’s plans. As for what he does with that information? That’s all up to him.”

The voice asked, “What do you think he will do?”

The Desolate Emperor smiled, “Based on my understanding of him, he will definitely cause trouble.”

“He isn’t strong enough!” said the voice.

The Desolate Emperor shook his head, “That’s none of my business.”

The voice fell silent.

Meanwhile, on the bridge.

Yang Ye walked over to the teleportation formation.

Leave!

Yang Ye walked with his sword in hand, and there was a smile on his face.

A pawn!

He knew that he may have become someone’s pawn. Not only that, he was a pawn that some were determined to eliminate.

He had two choices, but he actually only had one.

Because regardless of whether he did something, they would do something. Since that was the case, it was better to seize the initiative!

It didn’t take long for Yang Ye to arrive before the teleportation platform again.

A moment later, an old man appeared before him.

As far as Yang Ye was concerned, the old man’s strength wasn’t inferior to the Soul Exalt and may be even stronger!

A peak Lord Realm expert!

The old man gazed at Yang Ye in silence.

Yang Ye smiled, “Can you let me leave?”

The old man shook his head, “No.”

Yang Ye cracked a smile, “Then I’ll go over your dead body!”

Yang Ye vanished on the spot.

The old man raised his right hand slightly. In an instant, the space before him cracked open, and at the exact same moment that happened, Yang Ye’s sword stabbed into it.

Boom!

An instant later, Yang Ye’s intent sword was obliterated. At the same time, the space around Yang Ye cracked open and moved to devour him.

Suddenly, Yang Ye took a step back, and then countless rays of sword energy and sword intent appeared around him.

The Sword Domain Sphere!

In an instant, the space around him was sliced into bits, but it only took a short while for the space there to return to normal.

Meanwhile, the old man pressed his palm down in Yang Ye’s direction and made a grasping motion.

Bang!

The space before Yang Ye sank down, and a wave of powerful energy slammed Yang Ye over 300m away.

But that wasn’t the end of it. The old man abruptly dashed forward, and then a wave of powerful energy swept through the bridge!

The Boundless Water on both sides of the bridge rippled before it.

Yang Ye stopped, and then he closed his eyes slowly. He raised both his hands above his head, and then an intent sword condensed in his grasp.

A moment later, Yang Ye opened his eyes and slammed his sword down!

The Domain Sword!

Boom! Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

The Boundless Water on both sides of the bridge arose into waves. While they weren’t very tall waves, it was still an extremely terrifying sight.

Along with an explosion, the old man’s attack was instantly blasted apart while the old man himself was pushed 300m away.

Yang Ye didn’t stop there. He stomped his right foot down and flashed forward.

At the same time, numerous intent swords shot out from around him!

This time, the old man didn’t dare to act carelessly. He commanded a pitch black shield to appear before himself, and then the shield transformed into a thick armor that enveloped him.

Countless swords descended!

Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!

A wave of explosions resounded incessantly while the old man was pushed backward repeatedly. However, Yang Ye’s attacks weren’t able to break through the shield!

A few breaths of time later, Yang Ye stopped, and a pitch black shield shot at him.

Yang Ye stabbed his sword forward.

Bang!

The shield was forced to a stop.

Suddenly, the old man appeared before him, and then punched the shield.

Boom!

A wave of powerful force rippled out, causing Yang Ye’s intent sword to tremble. A moment later, he was pushed around 100m back.

The old man was about to follow up with another attack, but Yang Ye suddenly took a large stride forward and arrived before the old man. At the same time, a ray of sword energy followed Yang Ye’s movements!

The Sword Domain!

The old man didn’t dare to act carelessly at all when he noticed the powerful force carried within Yang Ye’s attack, and he hurriedly used the shield to collide against the attack!

Yang Ye’s attack descended!

Bang!

The shield shook, and then it cracked open while the old man was blasted away with the shield!

Yang Ye didn’t stop. He strode forward and stabbed once more. At the same time, countless intent swords shot out from around him, and they rained down upon the old man like a storm!

Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!

Explosions resounded incessantly, and the old man was pushed backward repeatedly behind his shield. In just a few breaths of time, he’d been pushed almost 10km back!

Moreover, the shield before him was on the verge of collapse!

Finally, an explosion resounded, and the shield finally exploded apart into fragments that filled the air!

The old man was shocked by the loss of his shield, and he intended to create distance between himself and Yang Ye!

But it was a little too late!

Yang Ye’s sword was very fast, accurate, and powerful!

This time, the old man had no choice but to go head-on against Yang Ye’s attack!

A wave of powerful aura swept out from within him, and it surged down upon Yang Ye’s attack like a hurricane!

Yang Ye’s attack arrived!

Hiss!

The sound of something being sliced open resounded, and then Yang Ye appeared around 30m behind the old man.

Yang Ye took a deep breath while his sword flickered between being material and ethereal.

Hiss!

A breath of time later, the old man’s body split apart behind Yang Ye, and blood sprayed all over the ground.

Yang Ye wiped off the blood on the corner of his mouth and stabbed his sword into the ground, “Take him away! Next!”
