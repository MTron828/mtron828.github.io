Chapter 2075 – A Treasure!

The surroundings trembled once Zhong Ye vanished. Moreover, even the planets extremely far away from them had started to shake.

Meanwhile, the old man vanished on the spot as well.

Crack!

Suddenly, space started to crack open, and then the space in a huge area slowly started to collapse.

It seemed like the world was being obliterated!

A battle between Sages was absolutely horrifying.

A long time passed before a sigh resounded here, and then the obliterated expanse of space suddenly returned to normal.

Meanwhile, Zhong Ye and the old man had returned to where they’d been standing a while ago. The old man had quite an unsightly expression on his face. As for Zhong Ye, based on his outer appearance, he seemed to be in much better condition than the old man.

Meanwhile, a voice resounded, “Return!”

Zhong Ye thought for a moment and said, “Does my Weapon Path not dare to protect just one person?”

The voice replied, “It’s not that we dare not, is that we can’t. In the end, he belongs to the Dao Path, so if anyone is going to protect him, it should be the Dao Path, not us. Moreover, my Weapon Path has done enough for him.”

Zhong Ye fell silent.

Meanwhile, the voice spoke once more, “Return.”

Zhong Ye’s figure gradually became ethereal, and it didn’t take long for him to vanish.

Only the other old man remained here.

The old man looked up into the sky, “Progenitor of the Weapon Path!”

The voice resounded once more, “Tell the people who’re supporting you that my Weapon Path won’t interfere again.”

The old man withdrew his gaze and vanished on the spot.

He was extremely displeased, but he wasn’t foolish enough to threaten or insult the Weapon Progenitor. Because if the Weapon Progenitor killed him, he would have died for nothing, and no one would avenge him. As for the Sage Alliance, it wouldn’t avenge him either.

So, he’d decisively chosen to leave!

…

Yang Ye stopped in space. He glanced at the injuries throughout his body, and his face was extremely gloomy.

Weak!

His battle with a Sage allowed him to realize how weak he was before a Sage. Even though he wasn’t entirely incapable of fighting back, he was almost there.

Sages were much, much stronger than he’d ever expected!

Strength!

He had to improve his strength as soon as possible!

Yang Ye took a deep breath and looked for a concealed place to recuperate. While he hadn’t died in the battle, his entire body was injured. So, his main objective right now was to recuperate, and only then could he continue his search for the Sprites.

Two hours later, Yang Ye’s injuries were completely healed with the help of his Primordial Violet Energy, and then Yang Ye stood up and vanished on the spot.

This time, he used the Sword Domain to conceal himself. Moreover, he stopped traveling on his sword, and he just flew through the sky instead. He had to keep a low profile now.

Yang Ye traveled past countless planets. Finally, at noon on the third day, Yang Ye arrived at his destination.

A fiery red planet stood before Yang Ye, and it was like a small sun. It was completely red and burning. It simply seemed like a miniature of the sun!

Now, Yang Ye had a problem. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Because it was so hot, so even he didn’t dare to get close.

Suddenly, Yang Ye’s eyes lit up! He had a divine flame within him!

Bang!

Flames suddenly surged out from within Yang Ye and instantly enveloped him. At this moment, Yang Ye seemed like a flaming figure.

His figure immediately transformed into a ray of fiery light that entered the planet.

It was hot!

Even with the Divine Yin Flame around him, he still felt hot. If he didn’t have the Divine Flame, then even his physical body may have been incapable of enduring such heat.

Yang Ye made Snowy come outside, and she immediately went back in upon seeing the world around him. Obviously, she didn’t like the heat.

Yang Ye laughed bitterly, and then he hurriedly persuaded her to come back outside. He rubbed her little head and said, “Where’s the Sprite in this place?”

Even though it wasn’t a very huge planet, it wasn’t small either. If Snowy didn’t help him, then it would probably take him years to find the Sprite here. Especially when there was a mysterious formation to conceal its aura.

Snowy blinked and glanced at the surroundings. A moment later, she sniffed the air, and then her eyes lit up. She pointed downward.

Yang Ye hurriedly took her in his arms and descended. A short while later, Yang Ye saw lava. Or it should be said that this entire planet was covered in lava and flames, and there was no water or plants here. Only lava and flames!

The temperature here was something even a Major Zen Realm expert couldn’t endure!

Meanwhile, Snowy stretched out her claws and waved them slightly. In an instant, the lava below split open, and then Yang Ye watched as a fiery red lotus appeared before him.

Yang Ye hurriedly asked, “Is that the Sprite?”

Snowy shook her head, and her eyes were filled with excitement.

Yang Ye was stunned, “Then what is that?”

Snowy started waving her claws.

It was a treasure!

A treasure? Yang Ye gazed at the lotus and scanned it carefully. After that, he took Snowy in his arms and flew over to it. The only difference between it and an ordinary lotus was that it was condensed from extraordinarily pure fire element energy, and it has been growing here for a very long time!

Yang Ye was about to take it when something unexpected occurred. The lava in front of Yang Ye and Snowy cracked open, and then a huge lava giant charged out from below the lava!

Snowy was shocked and hurriedly hid on Yang Ye’s shoulder.

Yang Ye became visibly vigilant as well.

Meanwhile, the lava giant suddenly slammed its palm at Yang Ye and Snowy. Yang Ye dodged backwards and swung his sword forward.

Hiss!

A ray of sword energy tore through the air and instantly struck the lava giant, causing a huge and extremely deep gash to appear on it. However, it only took a moment for the lava in the surroundings to surge to the lava giant, and then the gash on it instantly vanished without a trace!

Yang Ye frowned from the sight of this.

Meanwhile, the lava giant suddenly opened its mouth and roared at them. A pillar of flames shot out from its mouth.

Yang Ye tightened his grip on his sword, and then he leaped up and swung it down.

Hiss!

The pillar of flames was instantly slashed into two. However, a flaming fist arrived before him.

Yang Ye flicked his sword upward.

Bang!

The powerful force contained within the lava giant’s fist blasted Yang Ye away. However, half of its arm was sliced off in the process. But it took just a moment for the lava in the surroundings to surge over to it and instantly restore its arm.

Yang Ye’s face fell from the sight of this. The lava giant was simply invincible while it was within lava! Unless he could kill it in an instant, it would be able to recover incessantly!

Its recovery was even greater than Yang Ye!

Suddenly, the lava giant leaped up and charged at them.

Yang Ye’s eyelids twitched at the sight of this, and he was about to counterattack when Snowy suddenly opened her mouth and inhaled. Just that caused the lava and flames on the lava giant to instantly dim down, and the lava giant hurriedly moved 300m back!

Yang Ye gazed at Snowy, and she cracked a smile before looking at the lava giant. As soon as she opened her mouth, the lava giant moved another 300m back. Yang Ye could sense that the lava giant was terrified of Snowy!

But it did make sense because Snowy was a Sprite Lord, and she was the bane of beings like Sprites. However, Yang Ye wasn’t sure if the lava giant was a Sprite.

Yang Ye patted Snowy on the head and said, “Ask it if it’s the Sprite of this world!”

However, Snowy just shook her head without asking.

Yang Ye asked, “It isn’t?”

Snowy nodded and glanced at the surroundings. In the end, she sniffed slightly, and a long time passed before she opened her mouth. In an instant, the lava in the surroundings started shaking violently.

Suddenly, Yang Ye noticed that the temperature here was growing higher and higher. Even though Snowy didn’t like the temperature here, she didn’t fear it. Dislike didn’t equal fear.

So, the temperature here wasn’t able to affect her at all.

It didn’t take long for the temperature to rise rapidly. Even if he was covered within the Divine Yin Flame, it still wasn’t comfortable for Yang Ye. Because the temperature here could instantly incinerate a Major Zen Realm expert.

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings, “Is it not going to show itself?”

Snowy blinked, and then she opened her mouth again. An instant later, the flames in the surroundings suddenly turned ethereal.

The flames and lava here were formed from fire element energy, so they were nourishment to Snowy. However, after staying in the Primordial Pagoda for so long, besides Primordial Violet Energy, other types of energy were very rarely able to arouse her desire.

Suddenly, Snowy stopped.

Yang Ye asked, “What is it?”

Snowy gazed at Yang Ye, blinked, and then she fled into the Primordial Pagoda.

Yang Ye was stunned speechless.
