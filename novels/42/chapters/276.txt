Chapter 277 – The Southern Territory Is At The Bottom!

Of course, there was another important question. When did this woman notice him and why was she able to notice him?

“Are you a profounder of the southern territory?” Right when Yang Ye was puzzled, the woman who held his arm had suddenly asked this question.

Yang Ye returned to his senses, and then he nodded. Right when he was about to say something, the slightly chubby woman suddenly said with annoyance, “A First Heaven Realm profounder actually dares to come to the interior of the Grand Myriad Mountains? If my Darling wasn’t kindhearted, then you would have become food for those large fellows beneath us!”

Yang Ye grinned and said, “Both of you are probably not from the southern territory, right?”

“How did you know that?” The slightly chubby woman spoke with astonishment.

When she heard the slightly chubby woman, the woman by her side who was called Weiwei glanced at the slightly chubby woman before she shook her head helplessly. This fool.

Yang Ye frowned slightly. He was merely probing them, but he’d never expected that they really weren’t from the southern territory. If he wasn’t wrong, then they had probably come to fight for Karmic Luck at the Hidden Dragon Pagoda. But why would they have made an appearance in the Grand Myriad Mountains?

“Hey! You still haven’t answered me! How did you know that we aren’t from the southern territory?” The slightly chubby woman was slightly annoyed when she saw Yang Ye remaining silent.

Yang Ye returned to his senses, and then he grinned and said, “I guessed!”

“You!” The slightly chubby woman clearly didn’t believe him, and she instantly glared at him.

“Alright. Let’s first think about how we should escape!” Right at this moment, Weiwei who was holding on to Yang Ye and the slightly chubby woman glanced at the Flameroar Lions that densely covered the ground below as she spoke in a low voice. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

When she saw the dense expanse of Flameroar Lions that were pursuing the three of them from the below, the slightly chubby woman’s round face had instantly turned slightly ghastly pale. She wasn’t afraid of death, but she was afraid of being eaten alive by those Darkbeasts. It was fine if her head was the first to be eaten because she would die instantly and wouldn’t feel any pain. However, if they ate any other part of her like her hands or legs... then just thinking about it caused her face to grow even paler!

As he gazed at the dense expanse of Darkbeasts below them, Yang Ye frowned as well. If the little fellow was here, then he naturally didn’t have to fear these Darkbeasts. But the problem was that the little fellow wasn’t able to help him right now! It was undoubtedly impossible for him to deter these Flameroar Lions by relying on Grey! The Darkbeast Empire respected the strong. No matter if it was in terms of bloodline or strength, Grey was much more inferior to the Flameroar Lions. Moreover, the Flameroar Lions had formed an entire swarm. So, he would still be courting death even if he summoned Grey!

“Weiwei, fly quickly. I... I don’t want to be eaten alive....” The slightly chubby woman spoke with a slightly trembling voice.

Weiwei shook her head and said, “This technique that transformed profound energy into wings exhausts an extremely huge amount of profound energy, and I don’t have much left within me. My profound energy will dry up in two hours at most. At that time, we’ll probably really become their food!”

So it’s a technique! Yang Ye was enlightened when he heard her. In the beginning, he was extremely puzzled and bewildered when he saw that pair of wings appear. After all, it was something that only Spirit Realm experts could accomplish!

“Hey! Do you have any way out of this?” Right when Yang Ye was in deep through, the round faced woman suddenly gazed at him and said, “Since you dared to come here on your own, you definitely have something to rely on, right? If you really have some sort of technique that can save us, then stop hiding it.”

Weiwei turned her head to gaze at Yang Ye. Obviously, she felt that the round faced woman made sense.

Yang Ye remained silent. He really did have a way out of this predicament because he just had to summon the Lightning Eagle and he could escape the Flameroar Lions beneath them. However, he truly didn’t want to expose the Lightning Eagle before those assassins who were hiding in the shadows. If outsiders found out that he, Yang Ye, even possessed a flying Darkbeasts, then he would probably be unable to rest in peace forever. Of course, this wasn’t the main point. The main point was that if he summoned the Lightning Eagle, then he would have to do it in front of these two women...

Not only would such an action be world shocking, but it was also very likely that the mysterious tiny vortex would be exposed! So, Yang Ye shook his head before their gazes of anticipation. Right when he was about to say something, the slightly chubby woman had suddenly burst into tears, and she hugged Weiwei tightly as she cried. “Weiwei, I don’t want to die. I still want to become an inner court disciple of the Heavenly Sword Sect, I still want to marry Senior Brother Yuan Guixiu, and I want to give birth to many children for him....”

The corners of Yang Ye’s mouth twitched when he heard this. He was truly speechless....

Weiwei shook her head while a helpless expression covered her face. She said, “Yanyan, when can you start acting a bit more normally? If you continue acting like this, then not to mention Senior Brother Yuan, even the janitor of the sect wouldn’t dare marry you!”

“Weiwei, you....” Yanyan had become slightly angry from embarrassment. She seemed to have forgotten that Yang Ye was on the other side, and she shoved her face into Weiwei’s chest and started ceaselessly moving her head left and right. As she did that, she said, “Darling, it seems to have grown bigger.... This won’t do! I can’t be smaller than you. Once I return to the sect, I’ll go look for a thousand year old Ice-string Papaya. That’s not enough! If I have the chance, I’ll ask Senior Brother Yuan to give me a good massage as well....”

The corners of Yang Ye’s mouth twitched incessantly. This woman is truly terrifying!

Weiwei’s face flushed red, and she glanced at Yanyan as she said, “You damnable little girl! How could you say such things!? Don’t you know that there’s someone else here!? Hey, stop it! I’ll toss you down and feed you to the Darkbeasts if you continue moving your head like that!”

Such a threat was truly too great to her! She hurriedly stopped, and then she tilted her round face to glance at Yang Ye. Suddenly, she seemed to have thought of something, and her eyes lit up as she said, “Darling, I’ve thought of a method to escape!”

Yang Ye suddenly had a bad feeling when he heard this, whereas, Weiwei asked with delight. “What method?”

Yanyan withdrew her ‘claws’ from Weiwei’s chest, and then she pointed at Yang Ye and said, “Darling, if we toss him down to draw the attention of those Darkbeasts, then wouldn’t we have time to flee?”

Yang Ye’s face darkened when he heard this. Can she not be a little secretive? I’m still right here!

Weiwei was first stunned, and then she turned her head to glance at Yang Ye. She pondered deeply for a moment before she said, “You’re clearly aware of the situation we face right now. Since someone like you who’s at the First Heaven Realm dared to travel deep into the Grand Myriad Mountains, then I presume you definitely have the ability to take care of your own life. We sisters will be eternally grateful if you’re willing to lend us a hand!”

Yang Ye felt silent. In all honesty, he didn’t have any ill feelings towards these two women. To be precise, he had a slightly good impression of them. Because they didn’t confront him for hiding and watching them from the shadows, and they’d even tried to rescue him. Especially because they were both King Realm experts while he was merely at the First Heaven Realm. Under such circumstances, not only had they not expressed contempt and detest towards him, they even took the trouble to try and rescue him! This caused him to have a slightly good impression of them!

However, he could absolutely not summon the Lightning Eagle because the implications were too severe!

When they saw Yang Ye remain silent, both of them remained silent as well. At this moment, they could only place their hopes on Yang Ye. If Yang Ye still shook his head, then they would probably be eaten here!

Nevermind, I can’t just do nothing and refuse to help them. Yang Ye grinned.

However, right when he was about to summon the Lightning Eagle, Yanyan had suddenly shouted loudly before she pointed ahead with excitement. She said, “Darling, it’s Senior Brother Yan Han and the others. They’ve come to save us! Haha! We’re finally able to escape danger....”

When he heard this, Yang Ye looked over, and he saw seven people with wings formed from profound energy were flying swiftly towards them from 300m away. Yang Ye frowned once more when he saw these people. Shouldn’t these geniuses from the other territories have headed to the Ancient Battlefield? Why have they come to the Grand Myriad Mountains?Weiwei raised her head and looked over. When she saw their appearances, she instantly heaved a sigh of relief in her heart while she revealed a faint smile on her face.

In less than a few breaths of time, those seven profounders had arrived in front of Yang Ye’s group of three. The person in the lead of the group of seven was a young man around the age of 20. He had sharp and slanted brows, starry eyes, a flat and wide nose, and a ramrod straight figure. As he stood there, the light breeze from the surroundings blew on his ink black hair, and it caused him to seem indescribably charming and unrestrained!

The young man instantly revealed a pleasant smile when he saw Weiwei, and then he said, “Junior Sister Liu, we’ve finally found you.”

“Hey, Senior Brother Yan Han, I’m here as well. Don’t forget me when you see the woman you like, alright? Watch out or I’ll ask my Darling to pay no attention to you!” Yanyan suddenly spoke with displeasure.

Yan Han moved his gaze from Liu Weiwei and gazed at Yanyan before he said with a smile, “How could I dare forget Junior Sister Cai Yanyan!?”

When he spoke up to here, he turned to look at Yang Ye before he said, “Who’s this brother?”

“He’s a profounder from the southern territory that we picked up in the Grand Myriad Mountains!” Cai Yanyan said, “Senior Brother Yan Han, you said that I’m very bold in the past, but let me tell you that he’s even bolder than me! He hasn’t even attained the King Realm, yet he actually dared to travel deep into the Grand Myriad Mountains by himself. If he hadn’t encountered Weiwei and me, then he would have probably died a long time ago!”

“A profounder from the southern territory? The First Heaven Realm?” Yan Han was stunned when he heard Cai Yanyan, and then he gazed at Yang Ye and said, “You’re a profounder from the southern territory?”

Yang Ye nodded.

When they saw Yang Ye nod, a wisp of contempt instantly flashed in the eyes of Yan Han and the other six men behind him. One of the men behind him even said bluntly, “I never imagined that we would actually encounter a profounder from the southern territory in advance. According to rumor, the profounders of the southern territory are at the bottom of the ladder in strength when compared to all the other territories....”

“It isn’t a rumor!” Yan Han glanced indifferently at Yang Ye, and he interrupted the man as he said, “For the last thousand years, the southern territory has always been at the bottom. Especially during the last few rounds, the so-called monstrous geniuses of the southern territory were actually not even able to ascend the 1st level of the Hidden Dragon Pagoda!”

When he spoke up to here, Yan Han suddenly chuckled and said, “I heard a so-called Quasi Sword Emperor has appeared in the southern territory. Not only has he comprehended 4th level Sword Intent, but he has also attained the Enlightened Sword Heart! Haha! How could such a savage place have someone that has attained the Enlightened Sword Heart? What a huge joke! After all, my Heavenly Sword Sect is a Third Rank Sect that possesses countless geniuses in the Sword Dao. However, there hasn’t been a single disciple that has attained the Enlightened Sword Heart. So, how could one appear in the southern territory?”
