Chapter 226 – Domineering Old Daoist!

When the white haired old man appeared in front of Yang Ye, Man Shi’s pupils constricted violently while shock swiftly surged into his eyes. Because even he hadn’t noticed how the old man arrived here. Just this alone allowed him to understand that the old man’s strength was absolutely above his own. However, there was no turning back for him, and he had no choice but to continue with this attack.

Thus, a wisp of a ruthless expression arose in Man Shi’s eyes, and then he increased the strength he exerted with his enormous paw.

Right at this moment, a sword light suddenly tore through the battlefield. It was extremely fast to the point that even Man Shi who was a Spirit Rank expert wasn’t able to see it clearly. After that, his enormous paw suddenly flew into the air along with a pillar of blood. Moreover, because the sword light was truly too swift, an entire three breaths of time had passed before Man Shi sensed the sharp pain from this.

“AHH!!!” A miserable and shrill cry resounded in the forest as Man Shi’s enormous figure descended to the ground. As he gazed at the white haired old man, his enormous eyes were filled with terror.

Yang Ye who stood behind the white haired old man was shocked to the extreme as well. Man Shi was a Spirit Rank expert, yet such an expert was actually unable to resist a single strike from this old man. Could this old man be an Exalt Realm expert? Or perhaps he’s a Monarch Realm expert of legend?

The old man paid no attention to Man Shi. He turned around to look at Yang Ye instead, and he sized Yang Ye up before happiness could be seen in his eyes. He nodded and said, “I never expected that after falling into decline for so many years, a good seedling has finally appeared in the Sword Sect. The initial-stage of Sword Intent! Haha! The heavens haven’t forgotten the Sword Sect! It allowed the Sword Sect to possess another genius!”

When he heard the white haired old man, Yang Ye hesitated for a moment before he asked in a light voice. “Senior, are you the Sword Sect’s Daoist Zui?” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

A wisp of surprise flashed in the old man’s eyes, and then he nodded and said, “Yes. Kid, how did you know that I was Daoist Zui?”

Yang Ye instantly took a deep breath when he heard this. He’d never imagined that this old man before him was actually the Sword Sect’s legendary god of protection, Daoist Zui. How could anyone not know this name? It was the name of an expert that was at least at the Monarch Realm!

Man Shi was even more shocked than Yang Ye. When he heard Daoist Zui acknowledge his identity, the terror in Man Shi’s enormous eyes grew even deeper. At the same time, he’d abandoned his thoughts of fleeing because a mere Spirit Rank Darkbeast like him didn’t even have the ability to flee before this extraordinary expert of the southern territory!

Yang Ye suppressed the shock in his heart and smiled bitterly, and then he said, “Senior, thank you for saving my life just now. But Senior is probably still unaware that I’m not a disciple of the Sword Sect anymore!”

“You’re not a disciple of the Sword Sect anymore?” Daoist Zui frowned and said, “Kid, stop joking. I heard that you’d comprehended Sword Intent from those disappointing fellows in the Sword Sect, and that was the reason that I rushed all the way here from afar. It was because I was afraid you would be eliminated by those people who have ill intent towards the Sword Sect. Now that I’ve rushed over, you’re saying that you’re not a disciple of the Sword Sect anymore? Are you making a fool of me?”

The corners of Yang Ye’s mouth twitched when he heard this, and then he said, “Senior, I’m really not a disciple of the Sword Sect anymore....” When he spoke up to here, Yang Ye told Daoist Zui about the incident between him and the members of the Sword Sect.

When he finished listening to Yang Ye, Daoist Zui’s face sank. After a short moment, he shook his head and said, “Kid, you’ve comprehended Sword Intent, so there’s no need for you to say anything. I know that you will definitely not go back. With my status, I would naturally not force someone to join the Sword Sect as well!”

Yang Ye heaved a sigh of relief when he heard this. He was afraid that this old man would act like Su Qingshi and insist on him joining the Sword Sect because that would put him in a difficult position. He really didn’t want to join the Sword Sect, and even if Su Qingshi hoped he would, he still wouldn’t. Fortunately, this old man was reasonable and understanding!

Daoist Zui glanced at Yang Ye before he said, “Even though you’re not a disciple of the Sword Sect anymore, you’re representing the Sword Sect in the Ascension Rankings this time. So, don’t worry. I’ll help you seek justice for the unfair treatment you received in the Grand Myriad Mountains this time, and I’ll start with this Spirit Rank Darkbeast!”

As soon as he finished speaking, the old man turned around, and he didn’t seem to have made any movement, yet a sword light flashed once more. After that, Man Shi didn’t even have the time to react when his head flew into the air. At the same time, Daoist Zui’s figure vanished mysteriously on the spot.

“Kid, slaughter to your heart’s content in the Grand Myriad Mountains. It’s best if you can eliminate the Origin School’s Yuan Tong and the Ghost Sect’s Li Xianjun. Don’t worry, not a single Spirit Rank expert will interfere from now on!”

......

On that mountain which was over 500km away from Ascension Mountain Range. Daoist Zui’s figure suddenly appeared here, and it caused the expressions of everyone on the mountain peak to change in unison.

Qing Yun’zi was the first to recover from his shock, and he asked with shock as he gazed at Daoist Zui. “Senior Zui?”

Meanwhile, Su Qingshi and Yu Heng had returned to their senses, and they bowed to Daoist Zui and said respectfully, “Martial Uncle Zui!”

When they witnessed this scene, everyone in the surroundings instantly gasped. This white haired old man is actually the extraordinary expert of the southern territory, Daoist Zui....

Kugu’s expression instantly became slightly unsightly. The enmity between the Sword Sect and Ghost Sect was something that had continued for generations. If this old man made a move against him, then what else could he do besides wait for death to arrive? Flee? What a joke! How could an Exalt Realm expert like him flee from Daoist Zui who’d attained the Monarch Realm over a thousand years ago?

Even though they were only a realm of cultivation apart, this realm was truly like the gap between the heavens and the earth. The distance at the center couldn’t be made up for with any combat technique!

Besides Kugu, Hu Zongyuan’s expression was extremely unsightly as well. He naturally knew of this extraordinary expert of the southern territory. Just like everyone else, he’d never imagined that this trivial competition, the Ascension Rankings, would actually cause this legendary expert to make an appearance. If he looks for trouble with me because of the incident from before....

When he thought about this, Hu Zongyuan’s heart couldn’t help but tremble!

Daoist Zui paid no attention to Qing Yun’zi’s greeting. He nodded lightly to Su Qingshi, and then he gazed at Yu Heng and said, “You’re the current Sword Commanding Elder?”

Yu Heng hurriedly nodded.

“Do you even know how to be Sword Commanding Elder?” Daoist Zui suddenly spoke furiously, “Others have already brazenly and openly broken the rules of the competition, but as the Sword Commanding Elder of the Sword Sect, you turned a blind eye to it? When has the Sword Sect fallen to the extent of allowing others to openly and brazenly bully and humiliate it?”

Cold sweat instantly flowed from Yu Heng’s forehead. He naturally didn’t dare talk back, and he could only maintain silence.

Daoist Zui shook his head and said, “The Sword Sect really has fallen into decline throughout these years. But falling into decline is fine so long as the members of the Sword Sect have backbone and spirit, then the Sword Sect would still have hope. On the other hand, if the Sword Sect loses that as well and does everything cautiously, then the Sword Sect would truly be finished!”

“Senior, my Darkbeast Race didn’t bully and humiliate the Sword Sect....” Hu Zongyuan was about to say something from the side.

However, right at this moment, Daoist Zui suddenly turned to look at Hu Zongyuan and shouted. “How dare you interrupt while I’m speaking!?” As soon as he finished speaking, Daoist Zui’s figure vanished mysteriously on the spot.

Slap!

A clear and resounding sound of a slap resounded. Under the astounded gazes of everyone, Hu Zongyuan was directly blasted flying, whereas, Daoist Zui had returned to where he stood earlier....

With the strengths possessed by everyone in the surroundings, they’d witnessed the scene from before, and they saw that an extremely red palm print had appeared on Hu Zongyuan’s face....

Of course, they were even more shocked by Daoist Zui’s strength. Because an Exalt Rank expert actually didn’t have the ability to resist him at all. Besides a few people in the southern territory, could anyone rival such strength? Now, all of them understood something, and it was why the Sword Sect was still able to exist and remain as one of the six great powers even though it had declined to such an extent!

It was because the Sword Sect had Daoist Zui!

Qing Yun’zi had a solemn expression. From the attack Daoist Zui executed just now, Qing Yun’zi had determined the distance between Daoist Zui and himself. They weren’t on the same level at all! It should be said that besides the Master of the Origin School, no one could be a match for this old man!

To be even more precise, there were probably only a few people in the entire southern territory who could go against this old man who stood before them!

At this moment, all of the people in the surroundings had similar thoughts!
