Chapter 2134 – Martial Soul Beast!

In the screen of light, the armless man faces two Progenitor Realm experts on his own.

But his aura wasn’t inferior at all!

The old men exchanged glances, and then a gray robed old man said, “Who are you?”

The armless man walked slowly until he was just around 10m away from them, “I don’t care which organization you’re from and what your objective is, but you can’t touch him.”

One of the old men suddenly said, “You’re very confident!

The armless man replied, “Even if I can’t kill both of you, I can cripple you. Want to give it a try?”

One of the old men said, “We shall!”

As soon as he finished speaking, the armless man vanished on the spot.

Meanwhile, the scene on the screen stopped abruptly!

In reality.

The black robed figure said, “Did you ask me all of that because you’re worried about that kid?”

Nether Maiden fell silent.

The black robed figure said, “Don’t worry, we won’t touch him until those two existences behind him are dealt with! Come on! We have to go look for your other sisters!”

The black robed figure turned around and left.

Nether Maiden fell silent for a long time before following the black robed figure.

…

Once Yang Ye left the city, he shot up into outer space on his sword. It didn’t take long for him to leave the Human Dimension and arrive in outer space.

Around six hours later, a huge city appeared before Yang Ye.

Martial Emperor City!

An Nanjing was his objective now.

Martial Emperor City wasn’t in the territory of the Alliance of All, and it wasn’t a place the three paths could interfere in either. So, Yang Ye didn’t conceal himself. He’d been to Martial Emperor Academy in the past, but he hadn’t expected her to have been here.

Yang Ye openly arrived in the academy, and a middle aged man appeared before him as soon as he got close.

The middle aged man sized up Yang Ye and asked, “Yang Ye?”

Yang Ye glanced at him, “You recognize me?”

The middle aged man grinned, “Why wouldn’t I? Come with me!”

He turned around and left.

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and followed him.

Yang Ye followed the middle aged man to a mountain called Northern Martial Mountain, and there was a small bamboo house there. The middle aged man left after leading Yang Ye there.

Yang Ye entered the bamboo house, and there was an old man seated in it.

The old man grinned when he saw Yang Ye, “I’m the Vice Dean!” Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Yang Ye said, “Vice Dean, I’m here to look for a friend. Her name is An Nanjing. She should be in Martial Emperor Academy right now!”

“That girl?” The Vice Dean said, “You’re here to see her?”

Yang Ye nodded.

The Vice Dean fell silent for a moment and said, “To be honest, I don’t want you to meet her!”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Why?”

The Vice Dean replied, “I’m sure you know your current situation. If she’s linked to you, some organizations will definitely start targeting her. Do you want her to be targeted?”

Yang Ye fell silent for a moment and smiled, “That’s between me and her!”

If it was anyone else, he wouldn’t disturb that person. But An Nanjing was different. He firmly believed that she would definitely get angry if he intentionally avoided her so that she wouldn’t get into trouble. Moreover, no one else could understand their relationship.

The Vice Dean glanced at Yang Ye and said, “She can’t meet you right now!”

Yang Ye frowned.

The Vice Dean explained, “I’m not stopping you from meeting her, but she’s cultivating in Martial Emperor Cavern, and it’s an extremely rare opportunity for her.”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Martial Emperor Cavern?”

The Vice Dean explained, “It’s where the founder of Martial Emperor Academy, the Martial Emperor, resided. It’s a place that every student dreams of entering. However, the only way in is to obtain the permission of the Martial Soul Beast that the Martial Emperor left behind. In all these years, she’s the only one to have been permitted to enter. She’ll definitely obtain tremendous gains from that place, and it’ll be a waste to make her leave now!”

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and asked, “Can I go in there?”

The Vice Dean was quite surprised, “You want to go in there?”

Yang Ye replied, “I want to try!”

The Vice Dean thought for a moment and replied, “Alright!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he waved his right hand lightly, and both of them vanished from the house.

The Vice Dean led Yang Ye to the Martial Emperor Cavern. Actually, it was just a cave. It wasn’t very huge, and there was nothing special about it.

The Vice Dean gazed at Yang Ye, “This is the place!”

Yang Ye nodded and walked towards it. Right when he arrived around 2m away from the cave’s entrance, a wave of invisible energy obstructed him. At the same time, a small ethereal beast appeared before him.

The small demon beast was shaped like a tiger, but there was a black horn on its head. Besides that, there was a black ‘武’ character for martial on its forehead. Besides that, it had a pair of wings that were thin as the wings of a cicada.

At this moment, it was obstructing Yang Ye’s path.

It was the Martial Soul Beast!

Yang Ye glanced at it and pointed at the cave, “I want to go inside!”

The Martial Soul Beast shook its head, and then the invisible force started pushing Yang Ye back incessantly.

Yang Ye gazed at the Vice Dean, and the latter said, “Looks like it doesn’t acknowledge you!”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and patted his chest. Snowy emerged from there, and the Martial Soul Beast immediately stopped when it saw Snowy. Yang Ye’s figure stopped moving as well.

The Sprite Lord!

The Vice Dean had quite a solemn expression on his face.

Yang Ye went close to Snowy’s ear and whispered, “Trick it to let us in!”

Snowy blinked at Yang Ye, and then she gazed at the Martial Soul Beast. At this moment, it was sizing up Snowy with a curious glow in its eyes. Snowy waved her little paw at the Martial Soul Beast, and the latter hesitated for a moment before flying over to Snowy. It glanced at Snowy, and then it stretched out its paw. Meanwhile, Snowy stretched out her paw and touched its head, and then she pointed at herself before pointing at the cave.

The Martial Soul Beast clearly understood Snowy. It hesitated for a moment, but it didn’t take long for it to nod and display its agreement.

Snowy gazed at Yang Ye, and Yang Ye started walking towards the cave with Snowy. Suddenly, the little demon beast obstructed their path, and it pointed at Yang Ye before shaking its head.

Yang Ye’s face darkened. This fellow would only let Snowy in, and not him. That’s racism!

Meanwhile, Snowy glanced at Yang Ye, and then she pointed at the cave. The Martial Soul Beast clearly became quite anxious. It pointed at Snowy, then pointed at the cave, and then it pointed at Yang Ye before waving its paws.

It meant that Snowy could go in but Yang Ye couldn’t!

Snowy’s eyes opened wide. She slapped the Martial Soul Beast on the head, and then she pointed at herself. She was asking if it wouldn’t even give her that much face!

The Martial Soul Beast seemed to be on the verge of tears.

The Vice Dean was flabbergasted by this scene. The Martial Soul Beast’s status in Martial Emperor Academy was far above anyone else. Because the little fellow’s background was very, very special. Besides that, the little fellow’s abilities were extremely terrifying.

The Martial Soul Beast!

It was a beast that had once stayed by the Martial Emperor’s side!

Yet now, it was actually on the verge of tears because of Snowy!

It really was on the verge of tears.

It gazed at Snowy with an aggrieved expression and ceaselessly waved its little paws. It pointed at Yang Ye, pointed at Snowy, pointed at itself, and then showed a pleading expression to them.

Snowy couldn’t really bear to watch and gazed at Yang Ye.

Yang Ye smiled, “Tell it that we won’t go inside.” Actually, he couldn’t really bear to let this continue too. If he entered by force, the Martial Soul Beast would probably not dare to stop Snowy, and he could see that it really wanted to get close to Snowy. Or it should be said that it feared Snowy a little. It was a natural instinct to fear Snowy.

Moreover, it was obvious that it treated Snowy as one of its own kind, one that it could give its full trust too.

Snowy gazed at the Martial Soul Beast when she heard Yang Ye, and then she waved her little claws. After it found out that they would not be going inside, it heaved a sigh of relief, gazed at Snowy, and then slowly floated over to Snowy. However, it seemed to be slightly afraid, afraid that Snowy was still angry.

The Vice Dean was rendered absolutely speechless by this scene.

You’re the divine beast of my Martial Emperor Academy at any rate! Can’t you be a little more domineering?

It was like a little pet before Snowy!

Snowy glanced at it, rubbed its horn gently, and then started to talk to it.

Yang Ye naturally benefited from this.

Through their communication, Yang Ye found out what it was doing here.

It was a guardian!

It was guarding something, and only those who met the criteria could enter. An Nanjing clearly did, but Yang Ye didn’t!

Yang Ye glanced at it and said, “Snowy, ask it if it’s willing to go with us!”

“No! Absolutely not!” Suddenly, the Vice Dean said, “Young Brother Yang, absolutely not! It’s the divine beast of my academy, and it carries the inheritance of my academy. We…”

Suddenly, a wave of invisible force pushed the Vice Dean away.

Yang Ye and the Vice Dean gazed at the Martial Soul Beast. Obviously, the force had come from it!

They watched as it flew over to Snowy, and then nodded very seriously to display its willingness to leave with Snowy!

The Vice Dean was livid when he witnessed this.

At this moment, he almost exploded with rage!
