Chapter 1653 - We’ll Take It From The Ku Clan!

Translator: InVader

The opponent that the black robed old man feared the most wasn’t Yang Ye or An Nanjing, and it was the sword! Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Or to be more precise, he was afraid that the sword would join forces with Yang Ye!

Even though it was strong right now, its strength was limited. Because it wasn’t being wielded by anyone. However, once someone like Yang Ye wielded it, then its strength would multiply!

At that time, Yang Ye and An Nanjing would be able to pose a threat to him.

So, for safety’s sake, he’d decided to seize the sword first!

Yang Ye’s expression changed drastically when he saw the old man charge at Snowy. He stomped his right foot down, and his figure transformed into a ray of light that shot towards the old man. However, how could his speed compare to a True Realm expert?

At this moment, the old man was in front of Snowy, and he slapped his palm at Snowy.

Snowy blinked, and then she let go of the wooden sword and covered her eyes with her claws.

At this moment, her body was trembling incessantly. She was absolutely terrified.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye’s eyes had almost split apart with rage.

Suddenly, a mysterious figure in a linen robe appeared before Snowy, and the mysterious figure’s right hand stretched out and shook slightly.

Bang!

A wave of energy sprayed out from it. In an instant, the black robed old man was pushed around 300m back, and the mysterious figure was similarly pushed around 300m back.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye had arrived before Snowy, and he heaved a sigh of relief when he saw that Snowy was fine.

Snowy seemed to have noticed something, so she moved her fingers, and she saw Yang Ye through the cracks. As soon as she saw Yang Ye, she immediately jumped into his arms and started wailing.

In an instant, Yang Ye was covered in a white mist.

Yang Ye patted Snowy gently and sent her into the Primordial Pagoda, and the wooden sword quickly followed after her.

Yang Ye turned to look at the mysterious figure in linen robes. The mysterious figure was completely covered beneath the robe and Yang Ye’s divine sense would automatically vanish upon arriving 3m away from him. So, Yang Ye couldn’t find out who it was.

Suddenly, the black robed old man asked, “Who are you?!”

The mysterious figure replied with a question, “And who are you?”

The black robed old man fell silent for a long time, and then he turned around and vanished on the spot.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye gazed at the mysterious figure, “Thank you.”

The mysterious figure fell silent for a moment before he said, “He’s a member of the Yang Clan.”

Yang Ye asked, “You’re from the Yang Clan too, right?”

The mysterious figure didn’t answer him and just fell silent for a while before speaking again, “If I were you, I would get far away from the Yang Clan and never come back.”

Yang Ye asked, “Why?”

The mysterious figure replied, “Your father had many subordinates all those years ago, and most of them hold important posts in the Yang Clan. However, do you know why no one has come to you since you got back?”

Yang Ye asked, “Why?”

The mysterious figure replied, “Some are afraid of getting in trouble, and some want to protect you.”

Yang Ye asked, “What do you mean?”

The mysterious figure replied, “Your father was one of the numerous young masters from that time. He was certain to be selected as patriarch. Unfortunately, something happened to him, and his cultivation vanished. So, someone else is the patriarch now. Do you understand what I mean?”

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly, “The Yang Clan’s patriarch wants to kill me?”

The mysterious figure shook his head, “No one can stop him if he wants to kill you. But you have to realize that your father offended many as well. They similarly hold important posts in the Yang Clan. Moreover, some of them are much stronger than they had been. For example, that fellow from before.”

Yang Ye fell silent.

Meanwhile, the mysterious figure continued, “They are worried that you’re back to take revenge. Because they took everything your father gained for the clan. Besides that, they even secretly attempted to kill your father all those years ago. Now that you’re back, you’re participating in the fight for succession, and your natural talent is so extraordinary, how could they avoid feeling worried?”

He paused for a moment and continued, “Do you know why they aren’t openly attacking and killing you, or why both the Discipline Hall and Council of Elders had made a compromise earlier?”

Yang Ye shook his head.

“It’s because of your father!” The mysterious figure spoke in a low voice, “Because know one knows if your father is still alive. They dare not openly attack and kill you when they haven’t confirmed that.”

Yang Ye asked, “Was he very strong in the past?”

The mysterious figure fell silent for a short while and replied, “In the history of the Yang Clan, there have been three with the best natural talent. The first is the ancestor of the Yang Clan. He attained a certain level of cultivation, allowing his bloodline to undergo a transformation, and then he created the Yang Clan. The second is your father. He’d overcome the shackles of the clan’s bloodline, and he was about to obtain his own new bloodline. Unfortunately, that mishap occurred before he could succeed.”

Yang Ye asked, “What about the third?”

“Yang Lianshuang!” The mysterious figure spoke in a low voice, “The most monstrous genius in the Yang Clan right now.”

Yang Ye glanced at An Nanjing and asked, “What if she’d compared to both of us?”

“She’s superior to you!” The mysterious figure hadn’t even hesitated to give him this answer.

Yang Ye was speechless.

Meanwhile, the mysterious figure gazed at An Nanjing, fell silent for a long time, and said, “You’re very formidable as well. If compared with her… Even I dare not say for certain which one of you possesses a superior natural talent. However, you’re no match for her right now.”

Yang Ye hurriedly asked, “Why?”

The mysterious figure spoke in a low voice, “Because she’s at the Zenith Realm at least, right now!”

The Zenith Realm! Yang Ye fell silent. Once such geniuses attained the Zenith Realm, they would be absolutely terrifying. Not to mention Yang Lianshuang, even if he attained the Zenith Realm, his combat strength would definitely become extremely terrifying. At the very least, he wouldn’t have to fear True Realm experts.

Meanwhile, the mysterious figure said, “Leave. You’ve saved your friend. You can take your friend and get far away from Milky Way System. The further the better.”

Yang Ye fell silent for a moment and shook his head, “I can’t leave.”

The mysterious figure asked, “Why?”

Yang Ye replied, “I once thought that if I didn’t return to the Yang Clan and participate in the fight for succession, then the Yang Clan wouldn’t come looking for trouble with me. But I was wrong. They know I’m alive and know I have potential, so even if I leave, they still won’t let me live. Only a dead person is the safest, right?”

The mysterious figure fell silent for a moment and replied, “You can go far away.”

“Far away?” Yang Ye shook his head, “It won’t make a difference. Because my loved ones are in Merak System. If I flee, they’ll definitely act against my loved ones and force me to return. So, I can’t leave! I don’t want to care about the enmity between the previous generation, but since they aren’t willing to let me live, then I have to care about it even if I don’t want to. We’re all human. I’m not afraid of them!”

The mysterious figure gazed at Yang Ye for a long time and said, “The situation in the Yang Clan is very complicated.”

Yang Ye replied, “I have to do it no matter what. Because I’m a member of the Yang Clan while I reside in the Yang Clan. So, just as you’ve said, they wouldn’t dare to openly kill me. However, if I leave the Yang Clan, then I won’t be a member of the Yang Clan anymore. At that time, they won’t have to fear anything. At that time, I’ll be in a worse situation.”

Presently, he’d realized that there were things he couldn’t avoid. Just as he’d said, he would be a member of the Yang Clan while he stayed in it, and he could rely on many things and resources in the Yang Clan. Moreover, he can make them abide by the rules of the Yang Clan. At the very least, they have to abide by it on the surface. However, once he leaves the Yang Clan, they won’t care about the rules anymore.

So, he couldn’t leave the Yang Clan.

The mysterious figure fell silent for a long time, and then nodded, “That does make sense. But if you enter the Yang Clan without any support, it’ll probably be very difficult for you to survive in the fight for succession. Because many young masters will target you. Even though they can’t openly kill you, they can use the fight for succession as a platform to kill you. At that time, even if your father comes back alive, he won’t be able to blame anyone for your death!”

Yang Ye smiled, “If I really do die during the competition, then it’s because my strength was lacking, and no one else can be blamed for that!”

The mysterious figure said, “Fine. It’s your decision.”

The mysterious figure was about to turn around and leave, but Yang Ye suddenly said, “Do you know about the Ku Clan?”

The mysterious figure stopped and gazed at Yang Ye, “You’re going to the Ku Clan?”

Yang Ye Nodded, “I want to ask for a piece of Soul Nurturing Wood.”

The mysterious figure shook his head, “Don’t go.”

Yang Ye asked, “Why?”

The mysterious figure replied, “It’s a precious treasure to them. Every single piece of Soul Nurturing Wood is extremely precious to them. Even the disciples of the Ku Clan find it very difficult to obtain a single piece. So, do you think they will give one to you?”

Yang Ye frowned, “It’s that precious?”

“It isn’t just precious!” The mysterious figure continued, “Up until now, it’s the only known Soul Nurturing Tree in our universe. Moreover, it isn’t even a complete Soul Nurturing Tree. It seems to have been injured years ago, and I heard that it’s gradually drying up. So, do you think it’s just precious now?”

Yang Ye fell silent for a long time before he said, “Is the Ku Clan easy to negotiate with?”

The mysterious figure replied, “It depends on the topic. If it’s the Soul Nurturing Tree, then it’ll definitely be very difficult. If our patriarch goes to them, then perhaps they may give him face; but if you go… if I’m to be honest, they may not even be willing to meet with you.”

Yang Ye fell silent for an instant, and then he gazed at the mysterious figure, “Can you lend me a hand?”

The latter replied, “With what?”

Yang Ye answered, “Let’s go take it from the Ku Clan.”

“I have other matters to attend to. Farewell.” As soon as he finished speaking, the mysterious figure vanished on the spot.

Yang Ye felt speechless from the sight of this.
