Chapter 1802 – I’ll See You In The Large Universe!

The corners of Yang Ye’s mouth twitched slightly.

He didn’t say anything and just turned to look at the middle aged man. A moment later, the wooden sword appeared in his grasp, and then his profound energy started to surge madly.

As his profound energy surged, the wooden sword shook violently.

The middle aged man glanced at the wooden sword and said, “That’s a very good sword! Your sword is good, but I wonder if it’s master is strong!”

Yang Ye replied, “You’ll find out right now!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye vanished on the spot, and the middle aged man stretched out two fingers at the exact same time.

In an instant, the surroundings fell silent.

At this moment, Yang Ye was in front of the middle aged man, and the wooden sword was less than three inches away from the middle aged man’s forehead. But it couldn’t move an inch further because the middle aged man’s fingers had clamped down on it!

The middle aged man gazed at Yang Ye, “That’s all?”

“Of course not!” The talisman on Yang Ye’s right arm suddenly vanished, and then he grabbed the wooden sword with his right hand.

Boom!

Everyone watched with astonishment as the middle aged man and the platform of light were blasted 300m away. At the same time, the middle aged man’s figure became ethereal.

Suddenly, Yang Ye appeared in front of the middle aged man, and then countless rays of sword energy descended like a storm and enveloped the middle aged man.

At this moment, Yang Ye’s right hand combined with the wooden sword made every single attack of his feel horrifying in the eyes of everyone here!

Actually, the Ying Clan’s ancestor was slightly stronger than the Undertaker, but he had a lethal flaw. He couldn’t exhaust too much energy. So, strictly speaking, he was inferior to the Undertaker! Of course, the precondition was that he wasn’t able to instantly annihilate his opponents!

Just like that, the middle aged man grew fainter and fainter as Yang Ye swung his sword like a madman.

15 minutes later, Yang Ye stopped.

At this moment, the middle aged man’s figure was almost translucent.

He looked Yang Ye in the eyes and said, “I’ll see you in the large universe!”

Hiss!

A ray of light pierced through the center of his forehead.

Yang Ye put the sword away and spoke indifferently, “I’m not afraid of you!”

The middle aged man’s figure dispersed on the spot.

The experts of the Ying Clan instantly turned pale from the sight of this. They hadn’t expected that even their ancestor would lose!

He’d lost!

Their final hope was gone!

The experts of the Ying Clan weren’t the only ones who felt this way, the experts of the other four clans had extremely gloomy expressions on their faces as well. Even the Ying Clan’s trump card, its ancestor, hadn’t been able to do anything, so how would they fight Yang Ye now? Moreover, even the Ying Clan’s ancestor couldn’t stop Yang Ye, so if Yang Ye went to their clans in the future, would their ancestors be able to stop him?

At this moment, it wasn’t just the Ying Clan’s hopes that had been crushed, the hopes in their hearts had been crushed as well.

Suddenly, Ying Yu gazed at Lu Yuntian and the others, “Everyone, don’t hold onto any wishful thoughts. Either their clans or our clans will be annihilated today. Since they want to destroy us, then we’ll cripple them even if we have to die trying. We’ll make the Yang Clan and Wu Clan leave the medium universe!”

When he spoke up to this point, he turned to look at Yang Ye and the others, and he spoke ferociously, “So, kill them!”

Lu Yuntian and the others’ gazes turned icy cold when they heard him. At this moment, they didn’t have a way out because Yang Ye would absolutely not let them escape. Presently, killing one meant they broke even, and killing two meant they gained something!

“Kill!” Ying Yu’s voice suddenly resounded, and then the experts of all five clans charged at Yang Ye’s group.

Yang Ye waved the wooden sword in his right hand. In an instant, numerous rays of light flashed. He gazed at Ying Yu’s group, fell silent for a moment, and said, “Kill them all!”

He vanished on the spot once he finished speaking.

Hiss!

The head of a True Realm expert in the distance flew up into the air.

Even though the experts of the five clans were prepared to welcome their deaths, they couldn’t help but arouse the desire to retreat when they saw Yang Ye kill a True Realm expert in an instant. Meanwhile, a ray of light flashed, and then another head flew into the air.

When Yang Ye was about to launch another attack, Ying Yu suddenly appeared in front of him. Ying Yu was the only one here capable of stopping Yang Ye. If he didn’t help, then the experts on his side would definitely be annihilated by Yang Ye.

Yang Ye and Ying Yu’s gazes met in midair. They didn’t waste their breaths at all, and Yang Ye immediately transformed into a ray of light that vanished on the spot. An instant later, a sword arrived just a few inches away from Ying Yu’s forehead.

Bang!

A wave of powerful aura suddenly swept out from Ying Yu’s body. But as soon as it appeared, it was sliced into bits by Yang Ye’s attack. A moment later, Ying Yu was blasted over 1km away!

However, Yang Ye didn’t stop. As soon as Ying Yu stopped himself, Yang Ye had arrived before him again, and then Yang Ye’s sword descended towards him.

Boom!

Yang Ye was blasted over 1km away again. Just like that, Ying Yu was pushed back repeatedly. At this moment, he didn’t have a chance to fight back, and his defeat was only a matter of time!

Meanwhile, the experts of the five clans’ were collapsing. Because the Wu Clan had a 6th stage True Realm expert. Moreover, Yang Lianshuang, An Nanjing, Nether Maiden, and the others were there too. All of them were existences capable of fighting 5th stage True Realm experts. Not to mention 5th stage True Realm experts, they could even fight 6th stage True Realm experts!

Ying Qing’s eyes were bloodshot as he watched the scene before him. Suddenly, he looked down at Heaven Desolation City and roared with fury, “Ancestors, are you really going to just watch as the Ying Clan is annihilated?! If the Ying Clan is destroyed, how will you face our founding ancestor?”

Boom! Boom!

A moment of silence ensued before two powerful auras shot up from the city, and then a white haired old man and an old man in a luxurious robe appeared in the air above the city.

Both of them were 6th stage True Realm experts!

The experts from the five clans heaved sighs of relief when they saw the old men. The ancestors of the Ying Clan had finally shown themselves.

Meanwhile, the white haired old man gazed at Ying Qing, “Your shortsightedness caused the Ying Clan to fall into such a state. You can’t avoid responsibility for causing the Ying Clan to fall into this situation!”

Ying Qing’s face turned unsightly when he heard the old man, but he didn’t dare to refute it.

The white haired old man turned to look at Yang Ye’s group, “All of you are strong, but if we fight you to the death, even if my Ying Clan is annihilated in the end, your Yang Clan and Wu Clan will suffer heavy losses. So, let me ask you one last time. Do you really want to fight us to the death?”

Wu Ye hesitated for a moment and gazed at Yang Lianshuang, but the latter gazed at Yang Ye instead, “I make the decisions for the Yang Clan’s internal affairs, and you make decisions for the external affairs. So, you decide.”

Everyone here gazed at Yang Ye.

Actually, as soon as they heard Yang Lianshuang, Ying Yu and the others’ expressions had turned gloomy. Because Yang Ye’s decision was obvious.

Yang Ye turned to look at Wu Ye, “Senior Wu Ye, you keep one of them busy. Lianshuang, you work with An Nanjing to keep another one of them busy. Nether Maiden, all of you use your full strength to kill as many as you can.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he vanished on the spot, and he was in front of Ying Yu when he appeared again. An instant later, his sword descended.

Boom!

Ying Yu was caught off guard and blasted away.

Meanwhile, the white haired old man’s face instantly turned gloomy when he saw Yang Ye attack, and then he waved his hand, “Attack!”

Meanwhile, An Nanjing and Yang Lianshuang suddenly appeared in front of him, and then a black claw and a spear instantly slammed down towards him.

At the same time, Wu Ye appeared before the other 6th stage True Realm expert from the Ying Clan. Just like that, all of them entered into fierce battle again.

However, this battle didn’t last for long. Around 15 minutes later, everyone suddenly gazed at Yang Ye. At this moment, Yang Ye seemed like he’d transformed into a flaming man, and the sight of it caused Ying Qing and the others’ expressions to change drastically.

The mysterious flames!

Yang Ye had relied on those flames, his arm, and the wooden sword to kill the Undertaker that day!

Ying Qing hurriedly howled with fury, “Watch out!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye suddenly transformed into a flaming ray of light that vanished on the spot.

A moment later, Ying Yu’s pupils constricted. At this moment, he sensed the aura of death. It only took a moment for waves of terrifying aura to sweep out from him like waves. However…

Hiss!

A flaming wooden sword tore through the aura with ease.

Hiss!

An instant later, the flaming wooden sword pierced through Ying Yu’s forehead.

Bang!

After that, flames instantly engulfed Ying Yu and incinerated him completely. It was like he’d never been there!

The white haired old man and the old man in luxurious robes were shocked by the sight of this. They hadn’t expected Yang Ye to actually kill Ying Yu!

A 1st stage True Realm cultivator had killed a 6th stage True Realm expert!

At this moment, the experts of the five clans were horrified to the extreme!

Yang Ye waved his sword. In an instant, flaming sparks sprayed towards the surroundings.

After that, he gazed at the white haired old man and the others, “The Ying Clan can vanish from this world today!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he was about to attack.

However, Qiong Qi and Hou Qing’s voices suddenly resounded in his mind, “Watch out!”

Boom!

A moment later, everyone watched with astonishment as Yang Ye suddenly moved backwards repeatedly, and he only stopped after moving 3km back!

As soon as he stopped himself, he spat out a few mouthfuls of blood.

What’s going on?

Meanwhile, a voice resounded, “Annihilate my Ying Clan? Who do you think you are?”
