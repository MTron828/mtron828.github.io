Chapter 2198 – I Really Want To!

The Shaman Emperor stopped when he spoke up to this point.

Yang Ye clearly had the intention to destroy the entire barbaric race.

Revenge!

It was Yang Ye’s revenge on them, and the barbaric race wasn’t the only race that had attacked Yang Ye that day.

If Yang Ye was allowed to remain alive, all the races wouldn’t be able to escape a similar fate!

Something worth mentioning was that the Sages from the Alliance of All had arrived while Yang Ye was still slaughtering the Sages here.

However, they didn’t show themselves when they saw Yang Ye slaughter Sages like sheep.

It utterly deterred them!

Even Sages couldn’t stop Yang Ye now!

A long time passed before they left with heavy hearts.

Once the barbaric race lost its Barbaric King, it was instantly left without a leader and grew even more chaotic.

Besides that, it had lost its status in the Alliance of All, causing many experts from other races to plunder the Barbaric Dimension.

Simply speaking, the barbaric race had become the next human race!

…

Guman Estate.

After he returned to the Guman Estate, he saw A’Man and the others waiting for him. All of them gazed at him with quite a weird expression on their faces. Or perhaps their expressions should be described as fear. They knew what Yang Ye had just done.

He’d destroyed the barbaric race on his own!

Hate? ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

They didn’t have the right to hate him. If it wasn’t for A’Man, the young man before them would probably not spare them a single glance.

Yang Ye asked, “Are you ready?”

A’Man replied, “Everything is ready. We can go anytime!”

Yang Ye nodded slightly, “Let’s go!”

Just like that, Yang Ye took A’Man’s clansmen with him to Void Spirit Continent. After that, he went for Ling’s clansmen, and then he went for Mad Saber and the others’ clansmen. They naturally didn’t refuse Yang Ye’s invitation. Because all their races were in chaos, and they could wish for nothing more than to receive Yang Ye’s protection.

On this day, Yang Ye arrived in the Sky Dimension.

The sky race!

He’d gotten everyone but Yu Jing’s clan, and he was here in the Sky Dimension to get the Yu Clan.

The Yu Estate was in a state of desolation.

Once a top clan of the sky race was extremely desolate now.

Yang Ye entered Yu Estate, and there were only a few people left here.

Yang Ye couldn’t help but frown from the sight of this.

Suddenly, a clear and melodious voice resounded, “Who are you?”

Yang Ye turned around, and he saw a pretty girl there.

Yang Ye asked, “Where’s the people of this estate?”

She glanced at him and said, “They’ve either left or died.”

Yang Ye suddenly appeared in front of her, and her expression changed drastically. She moved backward repeatedly, “Y-You… I don’t have any immortal crystals…”

Yang Ye shook his head slightly, “I’m a friend of Yu Jing’s… Has his loved ones left or…”

She sized up Yang Ye and asked, “A-Are you really a friend of the young master?”

Yang Ye nodded.

She lowered her head slightly, “The patriarch and the others were captured by the Sovereign of Sky after the young master left.”

The Sovereign of Sky!

Yang Ye frowned, “Why?”

She spoke softly, “Because he helped the human race’s Yang Ye, and so our Yu Clan was treated as a traitor. Besides that, our enemies chose to beat us when we were down because of that, and then…”

Traitors!

Yang Ye spoke solemnly, “Didn’t Yu Jing leave the Yu Clan?”

The woman ridiculed, “The Sovereign of Sky and the others merely wanted an excuse to plunder our clan. All our spirit veins and immortal stones were taken by them. That was their true objective!”

Yang Ye fell silent for a long time before he asked, “Aren’t you planning on leaving?”

She shook her head, “Where can I do? It’s absolutely chaotic out there, so I’ll probably die really quickly.”

Yang Ye said, “Then leave with me!”

She looked up at Yang Ye with bewilderment in her eyes.

Yang Ye flicked a spatial ring to her, “There are immortal crystals in there. Tell the remaining people in here that if they’re willing to leave with me, then get ready. We’ll be leaving in a moment. If they aren’t willing to leave, just give this spatial ring to them.”

She glanced at the spatial ring, and then gazed at Yang Ye, “You…”

Yang Ye said, “Go do as I said!”

She hesitated for a moment, took the spatial ring, and left. It didn’t take long for her to bring a group to him, and there were a few hundred of them.

Yang Ye said, “All of you wait here for me! I’ll be back in a moment!”

Yang Ye had vanished.

Meanwhile, a man by her side asked, “Qing’er, who was that?”

She replied softly, “Young Master’s friend!”

She glanced at the spatial ring, and she noticed tens of thousands of immortal crystals in there.

It was a huge amount of wealth.

“Young Master’s friend?” The man frowned, “Why have I never seen him before?”

Suddenly, a sword howl resounded in the sky, and it resounded through the entire Sky Dimension. At the same time, a ray of blood red light shot up into the sky of Sky City.

Tears suddenly flowed out of her eyes when she witnessed this, “Young Master, is he your brother?”

At this moment, she recalled a scene from the past.

At that time, Yu Jing had walked out of his father’s house.

An old man suddenly cursed from within, “You unfilial son! You unfilial son! I don’t have a son like you!”

Yu Jing just stood there silently at the entrance.

A long time passed before he turned around and knelt down, “Father, over a hundred Sages are bullying my brother. He’ll die if I don’t go.”

The old man howled with fury, “You'll die too if you go!”

Yu Jing replied, “I know!”

The old man was on the verge of going mad, “Then what the hell are you going for?!”

Yu Jing smiled, “It can’t be helped, he’s a brother of mine!”

As he spoke, he slowly dropped to his knees, “Father, I’ll repay you for bringing me up in my next lifetime. No, perhaps I’ll come back alive. Hahaha!”

He turned around and left once he finished speaking.

In the house, the renowned patriarch of the Yu Clan was covered in tears!

A woman watched Yu Jing leave from far away, and she watched until his figure vanished.

Sky City.

Yang Ye’s sudden arrival shocked everyone here.

Yang Ye!

Yang Ye was naturally not an unfamiliar face to the sky race. After all, he’d been here on many occasions. Now, he was back again.

Blood red light was coiled around Yang Ye, and there was slaughter intent and viciousness on his face.

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings, and then a ray of sword energy shot through the sky.

Meanwhile, a huge golden barrier of light enveloped the city.

Bang!

The sword energy slammed against the barrier of light, causing it to tremble violently while some cracks appeared on it. As for the energy that bounced back from the barrier, it cracked open Yang Ye’s sword energy. However, another ray of sword energy descended.

Bang!

Countless people of the sky race watched as the barrier of light exploded apart.

The entire city shook violently like it was an earthquake!

In the sky above the city, Yang Ye pointed his sword down at the city, “Sovereign of Sky, I’ll give you three breaths of time. If I don’t see you, I’ll bury the entire city with you.”

A moment of silence ensued, and then a middle aged man appeared before Yang Ye.

It was the Sovereign of Sky.

Hiss!

Meanwhile, a ray of sword energy flashed, and then a sword stabbed into the Sovereign of Sky’s left chest. The blood red sword pushed him back until finally nailing him on Sky Hall.

Yang Ye hadn’t struck a lethal point, and the Sovereign of Sky hadn’t tried to dodge!

He couldn’t dodge at all!

Presently, Yang Ye was an existence that he couldn’t fight at all!

Meanwhile, over a dozen old men appeared not too far away from the Sovereign of Sky.

They were the remaining Sages of the sky race.

Yang Ye was about to attack when a clear and melodious voice resounded, “Step down!”

Those Sages hesitated for a moment and moved aside.

Yang Ye looked over and saw a woman walking over slowly.

It was none other than Xiao Qi!

The Xiao Qi Yang Ye knew!

She walked over to Yang Ye, gazed at him, and then lowered her head slightly, “I’m sorry!”

Yang Ye walked over to her, rubbed her head gently, and said, “You’ve never done anything to me that you need to be sorry for. I should be the one who says sorry!”

Xiao Qi had fallen into deep sleep for countless years just to save him. He had naturally not forgotten that. Besides that, he would have died on many occasions if it wasn’t for her.

Even though the Sovereign of Sky wanted to kill him on many occasions, Yang Ye never considered Xiao Qi and the Sovereign of Sky to be one.

She looked up at Yang Ye, fell silent for a long time, and said, “I’m the leader of the sky race now. The people of the Yu Clan are all fine. I didn’t harm them, but the other powers refused to let them live. So, I kept them in Sky City. In that way, I could keep them alive for now!”

She was the leader of the sky race!

Yang Ye turned to gaze at the Sovereign of Sky. Obviously, it was the Sovereign of Sky’s tricks.

Others may not be aware of the relationship between Yang Ye and Xiao Qi, but the Sovereign of Sky did.

Meanwhile, Xiao Qi spoke softly, “I…”

She seemed to want to say something, but she didn’t say anything in the end.

Yang Ye suddenly waved his right hand.

Hiss!

The blood red sword stabbed into the Sovereign of Sky’s body. His eyes opened wide, and then they gradually lost all color.

He was dead!

The Sovereign of Sky had fallen!

Yang Ye waved his right hand, and the blood red sword flew back into his grasp.

Yang Ye patted Xiao Qi’s trembling shoulder lightly, “You are you, and the Sovereign of Sky is the Sovereign of Sky. He tried to kill me on many occasions, so I have to avenge that. As for you, you saved me on many occasions, so the Sages of the sky race and everyone in Sky City can live.”

As he spoke, he turned around, but he suddenly added, “Xiao Qi, I actually really want to slaughter everyone in this entire city, and bury the entire sky race with my brothers. I really want to!”

He vanished on the spot once he finished speaking.
