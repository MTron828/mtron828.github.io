Chapter 1939 – Merge!

Suddenly, Hou Qing’s voice resounded, “Kid, stop her! That’s the Sage’s aura! Don’t let her use it!”

The Sage’s aura!

Yang Ye was shocked. He hurriedly went over to Snowy, but the aura instantly pushed him back repeatedly.

Snowy blinked, and then she glanced at her claw before looking at Yang Ye. She blinked and blinked, and she wondered when she’d become so strong!

“Calm down!” Yang Ye spoke carefully, “Calm down. Calm down, alright?”

Snowy blinked, and then she shook her head to display that she wasn’t tense at all!

Yang Ye said, “Calm down and don’t use that energy. Otherwise… otherwise it may harm me!”

Snowy shuddered, and then she hurriedly relaxed her grasp.

Yang Ye heaved a sigh of relief, and then he went over to Snowy and spoke seriously, “Don’t rashly utilize that energy, alright?”

“You really can’t use it rashly!” Hou Qing added.

Snowy possessed the protection of a Sage, the Sage’s aura. Simply speaking, Snowy could instantly kill a 5th stage Enlightened Realm expert with it, and it could even heavily injure a Hear Dao Realm expert.

Both Yang Ye and Hou Qing couldn’t endure that attack right now!

Even though she didn’t really understand what Yang Ye meant, Snowy still nodded habitually. She was extremely obedient to Yang Ye.

Meanwhile, she seemed to have thought of something, and she pointed at the Sky Dragon before swiftly waving her claws about!

She was saying that it bullied her!

Yang Ye gazed at the Sky Dragon. At this moment, the Sky Dragon was looking at him too. Or to be more precise, it was looking at Snowy. There was a trace of fear in its eyes.

Yang Ye took Snowy in his arms and went to the Sky Dragon. Snowy suddenly raised her claw and waved it at the Sky Dragon. The Sky Dragon’s eyelids twitched, and then it hurriedly took two steps back.

Snowy glared at it. She was clearly still angry!

Yang Ye rubbed her head and gazed at the Sky Dragon, “I know you can understand me. I don’t like forcing others. So, if you’re not willing to follow me, then you can leave.”

He refused to force it!

Merging required mutual consent. Otherwise, it would bring more harm than benefit.

The Sky Dragon shook its head slightly.

Yang Ye asked, “What do you mean?”

A moment of silence ensued, and then the Sky Dragon said, “He asked me to go with you!”

It was a soft, female voice.

Yang Ye glanced at the Sky Dragon and said, “Then why did you attack Snowy?”

The Sky Dragon glanced at Snowy, “She… is too dangerous!”

Dangerous?

Snowy blinked and gazed at Yang Ye.

Yang Ye had a rough understanding. The Sky Dragon was a True Dragon that had absorbed the energy within countless spirit veins to become the Sky Dragon. However, Snowy was a Sprite Lord, so Snowy was the bane of all things like the Sky Dragon. Thus, the Sky Dragon attacked instinctively when it saw Snowy.

Meanwhile, Snowy scratched Yang Ye’s face and pointed at the Sky Dragon. Obviously, she was asking what it meant!

Yang Ye smiled and replied, “She said you’re very powerful, and she’s very afraid that you’ll harm her. So, she attacked you!”

I’m very powerful! Snowy understood Yang Ye, and her eyes lit up. She turned to look at the Sky Dragon, cracked a smile, and then waved her claw. She was telling the Sky Dragon that she was extremely powerful too.

The Sky Dragon felt speechless.

Yang Ye shook his head and smiled, and then he gazed at the Sky Dragon, “Since you’re willing to stay with me, then let’s work well together. How do I achieve a perfect merge with you?”

The Sky Dragon spoke solemnly, “It mainly depends on you. I’ll enter your body, and then we’ll merge. I won’t resist you. However, how much you’re able to merge will depend on your own ability.”

Yang Ye asked, “What will happen to you once we merge?”

The Sky Dragon replied, “I’ll grow!”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “You’ll grow?”

The Sky Dragon pondered deeply for a moment and said, “You’ll be able to obtain my strength from merging with me, and I’ll be able to use you to grow. We’ll use each other. It was the same for me and him.”

She was referring to the old man on the Sky Stairs!

Yang Ye nodded slightly and said, “Come, let’s merge!”

“It’ll be slightly painful!” As soon as the Sky Dragon finished speaking, it transformed into a ray of white light that entered Yang Ye’s forehead.

In an instant, Yang Ye’s eyes opened wide, and it didn’t take long for his face to start twisting.

Pain!

It wasn’t just pain! It was simply worse than death!

It felt like a sharp needle had been stabbed into the tip of the finger—NO!—it was worse!

His body, mind, and soul were being impacted severely.

“Get used to it!” Meanwhile, the Sky Dragon’s voice resounded in Yang Ye’s mind, “Get used to such pain. It’s the first step. If you can’t get used to such pain, then I will leave your body. Because merging by force will result in your death!”

Get used to it!

Yang Ye forcefully made himself endure it, sat down cross-legged, and endured it by sheer will!

Snowy and Lei Lin were absolutely worried. Meanwhile, Hou Qing explained, “He’s merging with it. Right, once he completes it, he’ll become even stronger, extremely stronger.”

Snowy waved her claws.

Hou Qing had quite the headache. How would he know what Snowy was saying?”

Meanwhile, Lei Lin understood the predicament he faced and explained, “Snowy is asking if you’re lying to her.”

Hou Qing hurriedly shook his head to display that he wasn’t.

Snowy looked around, and then she gazed at Lei Lin. Lei Lin immediately had a bad premonition, “Sno… Snowy… what are you planning…”

Snowy cracked a smile, and then she transformed into a ray of white light that shot towards Lei Lin’s forehead.

Bang!

However, she knocked Lei Lin to the ground instead, and she herself fell to the ground as well.

Snowy rubbed her forehead and looked up at Hou Qing before waving her claws swiftly. She was saying that he’d lied to her!

Hou Qing gulped, “I…”

…

Time trickled by, and Yang Ye’s expression gradually returned to calm.

Even though it was beyond painful, it wasn’t that scary for Yang Ye. After all, he’d tempered his body and suffered a huge amount of pain in the process.

Just like that, two weeks passed in the blink of an eye.

Suddenly, Yang Ye opened his eyes and stood up. He looked down at his right hand, and then an ethereal white dragon claw suddenly appeared around it!

The dragon claw enveloped his hand!

Yang Ye clenched his right fist slowly. As soon as he did that, the white dragon claw actually started moving along with him!

Dragon claws!

Meanwhile, Hou Qing appeared beside Yang Ye, “Congratulations!”

Yang Ye shook his head, “I haven’t merged completely with her.”

“You’re at your limit!” Meanwhile, the Sky Dragon’s voice resounded in Yang Ye’s mind, “My body is much stronger than yours. So, merging to this extent is the limit of your body. If we continue, your body and soul won’t be able to endure it, and it’ll only have an opposite effect!”

Yang Ye nodded and looked down at his hand, or to be more precise, he looked down at the dragon claw, “How strong is it?”

The Sky Dragon replied, “Give it a try!”

Yang Ye took a deep breath and gazed at Hou Qing, but the latter vanished on the spot.

Yang Ye was stunned speechless.

Yang Ye laughed bitterly and left the Primordial Pagoda. He didn’t dare to try it inside here because the Primordial Pagoda would kill him if he destroyed the space in here.

In the boundless starry sky, Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings and slammed his first forward.

Boom!

The space there was obliterated!

Instantly obliterated!

In the lower universe, he could obliterate a large expanse of space with a swing of his palm, but it was different here in the medium universe. The space here was much stronger, and he was only able to slice through it while utilizing the Sword Domain combined with Split Second!

Yet now, he could obliterate an expanse of space with a single swing of his palm!

It was the outcome of two types of energy being combined. The first was the Sky Dragon’s strength, and the second was his own. When they were merged together and erupted from him, it wasn’t just a simple addition of one plus one!

Presently, just that attack may be sufficient to instantly kill a 2nd level Enlightened Realm expert!

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts, glanced at the surroundings, and was about to leave. However, Hou Qing’s voice resounded in his mind, “It’s best if you don’t let the sky race know that you have the Sky Dragon.”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Why?”

Hou Qing explained, “If you’re extremely strong to the point the sky race has to fear you, then they would be happy to let you be their protector. But the problem is that you’re only at the 6th stage of the True Realm. You’re so weak and human too, so do you think they’ll let you be their protector? No, they won’t just refuse it, they’ll even try to take the Sky Dragon from you!”

Yang Ye fell silent.

Meanwhile, Hou Qing added, “This is human nature. It’s best if you don’t challenge the sky race’s human nature!”

Yang Ye nodded, “I understand!”

Suddenly, Yang Ye frowned slightly, and then he vanished on the spot.

Around 10,000km away, Yang Ye stopped, and Li Jiang was in front of him. Li Jiang only had a single arm left, and his entire body was covered in injuries while his aura was absolutely weak. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Yang Ye’s face fell, “What happened?”

Li Jiang’s countenance was ghastly pale, “We were attacked when we passed through the Endless Ocean. Yin Hou… Yin Hou was captured while trying to save us. Li Tong and I were able to escape, but we got separated.”

Yin Hou had been captured!

Yang Ye’s face turned gloomy.

Meanwhile, Li Jiang added, “Yin Hou told us to find you, and tell you to leave the Sky Dimension immediately! You must leave immediately!”

Leave the Sky Dimension!

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly. What did she figure out? Why did she say that?
