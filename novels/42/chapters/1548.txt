Chapter 1549 - Tricked!

Translator: InVader

It was a beautiful woman who was standing in front of Yang Ye. She looked to be only around the age of thirty. She had willow leaf shaped brows, a beautiful appearance, an ample bosom, and plump buttocks. She looked like a mature peach, and she was extremely attractive.

She was a Rebirth Realm expert as well! Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Yang Ye gazed at her for a long time, and then he shook his head, “I’ve really never met you!”

She cracked a smile and said, “Are you sure?”

Yang Ye nodded, “I’m sure.”

She suddenly said, “I’m the Goat Clan’s patriarch!”

Yang Ye was stunned.

The Goat Clan’s patriarch!

Yang Ye’s face turned quite unsightly. What was his identity right now? He was the Goat Clan’s representative! But he didn’t recognize the Goat Clan’s patriarch. So, wasn’t that a huge joke?

Yang Ye knew that he’d been exposed, and he had no way to lie his way out of it. Because he’d repeatedly confirmed that he didn’t know her. He’d been tricked!

A short while passed before Yang Ye laughed bitterly, “Senior, what do you want?”

“What do I want?” She smiled and said, “Little Fellow, I want to ask you what you want. Why are you pretending to be a member of my Goat Clan?”

Yang Ye replied, “Someone asked me which clan I was from, so I just said the Goat Clan.”

She said, “Is that really the only reason?”

Yang Ye nodded, “Yes!”

She gazed at him for a long time and smiled, “Alright, I believe you. So, do you know… I was truly shocked when I heard a goat from my Goat Clan entered the top four of the Meeting of the Clans. However, when I asked about it, I discovered that my Goat Clan doesn’t have anyone called Xiao Yang. So, I decided to come here and have a look myself. I never expected that you really aren’t from my Goat Clan. Needless to say, I’m quite disappointed.”

She was naturally disappointed. If Yang Ye really was from the Goat Clan, then it was definitely extraordinarily good news for the Goat Clan. Because it represented that the Goat Clan was about to rise up in the world. However, she was disappointed. This fellow before her wasn’t from the Goat Clan.

Yang Ye said, “I’m in the wrong for pretending to be from the Goat Clan. But please believe me, I have no ill intent towards the Goat Clan.”

She said, “You have two paths before you.”

Yang Ye gazed at her, and she said, “The first is to immediately stop using my Goat Clan’s name, announce that you’re not from the Goat Clan, and announce that you have nothing to do with my Goat Clan.”

Yang Ye remained silent for a long time before he asked, “What about the second path?”

If he announced that he wasn’t from the Goat Clan now, then he would be in a huge amount of trouble. Even though he had the Demon God’s inner core and could barely be considered a member of the demon race, he was still a human. Moreover, he didn’t want the demon race to become vigilant towards him!

His objective was the Hallowed Grounds of the Divine Phoenix Clan. If they became vigilant towards him, then he would definitely be unable to do anything even if he got into the Divine Phoenix Clan.

“The second!” She smiled and continued, “The second is you’re from my Goat Clan.”

Yang Ye gazed at her and asked, “What are you trying to say?”

She replied, “What I’m trying to say is that I’ll recognize you as a member of the Goat Clan. Moreover, you’re really representing my Goat Clan in the Meeting of the Clans. Understand?”

Yang Ye asked, “Why?”

She answered, “My Goat Clan is weak, and it’s considered to be the weakest amongst the clans in the demon race. You may not know it but I’m the only Rebirth Realm expert in my Goat Clan. As for my Goat Clan’s younger generation, none are exceptionally outstanding. Under such circumstances, my Goat Clan will naturally be bullied by the other clans. However, if an extraordinary genius appears in my Goat Clan, then the other clans that bullied my Goat Clan in the past would have to consider the consequences before thinking about bullying my Goat Clan again!”

Yang Ye came to a complete understanding at this point.

The strength and potential he revealed couldn’t be underestimated. If he really was from the Goat Clan, then the other clans would definitely not dare to continue bullying the Goat Clan. So, she wanted to use him to deter the other clans.

Meanwhile, the woman added, “There’s another reason. The younger generation of my Goat Clan are completely spiritless. If an extraordinary genius appears in the younger generation of my Goat Clan, then it’ll definitely be a form of motivation to them. So, if you want to continue pretending to be a member of the Goat Clan, I’ll agree to it. However, I have to make something clear, and it’s that if you do anything that harms the demon race, then I’ll immediately cut all ties with you.”

Yang Ye remained silent for a long time, and then he nodded, “Alright!”

She grinned, “I won’t declare that you’re from my Goat Clan, but I won’t say that you aren’t either. I hope we have a pleasant cooperation!”

“Me too!” replied Yang Ye. The Goat Clan needed the reputation he brought to it, and he needed a suitable identity. So, they were using each other.

She nodded and said, “I’ll be staying in Heaven’s Vault City for now. So, I can give you some help for some things, but I won’t help you openly.”

Yang Ye nodded, “I understand!”

She glanced at him and seemed to want to ask something. But she hesitated for a moment and didn’t ask in the end. She just turned around and left Yang Ye’s cultivation room!

Yang Ye heaved a slight sigh of relief. He’d actually guessed what she intended to ask. She definitely wanted to ask if he was from the demon race or not. If she asked that, it represented that she’d guessed that he was a human. Just think about it, if he was from the demon race, then would he have to pretend to be from the Goat Clan?

Fortunately, she hadn’t asked!

Obviously, she wanted him to boost the Goat Clan’s reputation.

Once she left, Yang Ye immediately entered the Primordial Pagoda.

Cultivation!

He intended to use the month of time he had to fully perfect the ability to make his strength rebound within his opponents.

His spar with Ku Yuan allowed him to understand that the geniuses of the demon race were much stronger than he’d ever imagined. Under the circumstances that he couldn’t use a sword, his physical strength and defenses had no advantage over the geniuses of the demon race! After all, he’d used his full strength and the Brink Laws yet was still unable to gain the upper hand just now!

Practice makes perfect!

Yang Ye was ceaselessly swinging punches every single day and using space to make his energy rebound.

Just like that, time trickled by, and a month passed.

Besides spending time with Xiao Yuxi, Yang Ye spent the entire month perfecting the ability to rebound energy. After a month of training, even though he still hadn’t attained perfection, he could make 90% of his energy rebound within his opponent. Now, the Elemental Breaker technique would send the energy in his fist directly to his opponent’s internal organs, and then it would immediately rebound like an echo from inside out!

So, if a Rebirth Realm expert went head-on against a punch of his now, then it was possible to instantly transform that Rebirth Realm expert into mush!

Now, he had another trump card!

Yang Ye left the cultivation room.

Man Shi and the others were waiting outside for him. Today was the last day of the competition. Even though they’d been eliminated, Yang Ye hadn’t! As Yang Ye’s friends, they naturally had to come and cheer for him.

Man Shi smiled, “How do you feel?”

Yang Ye smiled, “Not bad. Even fighting a few hundred rounds won’t be a problem!”

Man Shi smiled, “Good. We’re waiting for you to take the first!”

Yang Ye shook his head, “As far as I’m concerned, just the top three is sufficient!”

Man Shi said, “That won’t do! We’ve put all we have on you. You can’t let your brothers lose everything!”

“Exactly!” Kuang Jing who rarely spoke said, “We’ve bet everything we have on you. If you don’t take the first, then we’ll have to eat grass from now on!”

“You bet everything on me?” Yang Ye asked, “Betting is allowed?”

“Of course!” Man Shi smiled, “It’s considered as an extra game that many demon beasts participate in. Actually, the odds of you taking the first are shockingly high. It’s four to one. Yours is the highest! Haha! They don’t really think highly of you.”

Even though Yang Ye’s previous display was extremely dazzling, Yang Ye’s results on Demon God Mountain weren't very extraordinary, or it should be said to be terrible. So, many demon beasts didn’t think highly of him. If he hadn’t made quite a dazzling display earlier, the odds would have been even higher!

Yang Ye glanced at them and asked, “All of you really bet everything you have on me?’

“Of course!” Man Shi smiled, “But don’t feel pressured. If worse comes to worse, we’ll just eat grass for a few years. I’m serious, don’t feel too pressured!”

Yang Ye rolled his eyes at them, “Then wait to eat grass!”

Man Shi jumped, “Big Brother, don’t do that. If we lose, we won’t just have to eat grass. We really went all out this time. We didn’t just use everything we had, we even borrowed from our friends and clans. If you lose, we won’t have a place to live in the Demon Territory! Because we would owe too much, and we can’t repay our debts!”

Yang Ye raised a finger and said, “If I get the first, I want half of your winnings!”

“You’re terrible!” Man Shi jumped, “You…”

Yang Ye shrugged, “I’ll go easy on my opponents if you refuse!”

Man Shi and the others instantly revealed bitter expressions. Meanwhile, Yang Ye chuckled, “Don’t show me such bitter expressions. I dare not guarantee that I’ll get the first, but I guarantee that I’ll try my best!”

Even though his target was just the top three, he would definitely not admit defeat in battle. If he could take the first, he would naturally do so. However, he couldn’t use his sword, she didn’t really dare to guarantee that he could get the first.

Man Shi nodded, and then he spoke seriously, “Just do your best. Alright, let’s stop wasting time and set out!”

It didn’t take long for them to arrive at the venue in Heaven’s Vault City.

At this moment, countless demon beasts were gathered here. It was the last day of the Meeting of the Clans, and it would be the three most brilliant battles of the competition.

This time, it was a truly fierce battle, so they would naturally not allow such an opportunity to slip by!

In the ring, Gu Mo glanced at Yang Ye and the others, and then he said, “Do you have anything to say before the competition begins?”

Ku Yuan, who stood on the left, stepped forward and said, “My goal is the first!”

His voice reverberated like a thunderclap, and it could be heard from extremely far away.

“Ku Yuan!”

“Ku Yuan is number one!”

Countless demon beasts roared furiously. Obviously, they idolized him.

Gu Mo’s gaze descended onto the Blue Bird Clan’s Yan Lingxue.

Yan Lingxue spoke indifferently, “I either die or take the first!”

It was domineering!

Those who idolized Yan Lingxue instantly started shouting madly.

A short while passed before Gu Mo gazed at Ku Moye.

Ku Moye glanced at Yan Lingxue and Ku Yuan, “I’ll kill anyone who fights me for the first!”

It was extremely aggressive!

Those who idolized Ku Moye immediately started cheering.

It didn’t take long for Gu Mo to look at Yang Ye.

Yang Ye remained silent for an instant, and then he smiled, “I’ll take the second!”

All the demon beasts and even Gu Mo were stunned when they heard this.

Suddenly, Yang Ye glanced at Ku Moye and the others, and he added, “Then would any of you dare to take the first?”

The surroundings instantly became perfectly silent!
