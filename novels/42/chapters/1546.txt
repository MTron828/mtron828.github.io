Chapter 1547 - Use Your True Form!

Translator: InVader

Man Shi, Kuang Jing, and Hu Meng had weird expressions on their faces when they heard the roaring laughter.

If Yang Ye wasn’t the one who drew lot number one in group one, then the heavens really had been good to that fellow. However, Yang Ye was the lucky one in group one. While they didn’t know how strong Yang Ye was, they were very well aware that there was absolutely no more than three people here who could fight Yang Ye!

“Who got lot number one in group one? Get the fuck up here!” Suddenly, a furious shout resounded from one of the rings.

Yang Ye and the others were slightly stunned, and then they looked at Yang Ye.

Yang Ye gazed at the ring and said, “Lot number one fights first?”

Man Shi nodded, “It starts in ascending order!”

Yang Ye nodded, “Alright, the earlier it’s done, the earlier I can rest!” As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye’s figure flashed and appeared on the ring.

A robust young man in a black robe was standing on the ring. He was stunned when he saw Yang Ye, and then he asked, “Don’t tell me that you pulled lot number one!”

Yang Ye nodded, “Indeed!”

The black robed young man’s face instantly became extremely unsightly. Because he’d seen Yang Ye fight. He knew the young man in beast skin which Yang Ye had beaten up during the second round. He was on par with that young man, but that young man hadn’t even been able to fight back against Yang Ye.

In the beginning, he felt that he was extremely lucky, but he hadn’t expected the gods to stab him in the back.

A short moment of silence ensued before he suddenly sent Yang Ye a voice transmission, “Brother, I admit defeat!”

The demon beasts of the demon race were mostly very unyielding. There were two reasons why he’d admitted defeat right away. Firstly, Yang Ye was too strong, and he knew that he was no match for Yang Ye. Secondly, he’d acted arrogantly and asked his opponent to get the fuck up the ring. Simply speaking, he was afraid Yang Ye would beat him to death. After all, killing was allowed in the ring!

Yang Ye was stunned when he heard the young man. He wasn’t able to believe his ears and asked, “Are you sure?”

The young man nodded and spoke via voice transmission, “I am. However, er… Can you let me lose with my dignity intact? For example, let’s fight for a while. Just give me 15 minutes. You can defeat me after that. Alright?”

Yang Ye had quite a strange expression on his face. Obviously, he hadn’t expected himself to encounter something like this. He thought for a moment and said, “Alright!” He was willing to cooperate when it was something as trivial as this.

The young man was delighted and said, “Thank you.”

As he spoke, he stomped his right foot down, and then he shot forward like a cannonball.

Needless to say, the young man was extremely swift, and his aura was very strong. However, regardless of whether it was his speed or aura, they were too weak before Yang Ye! But since Yang Ye had agreed to it, he naturally intended to do it well. Yang Ye clenched his fist and slammed it at the young man!

Yang Ye hadn’t used his full strength and merely used around 20% of his strength. He was naturally afraid that he would use too much strength and cripple his opponent.

Bang!

A muffled explosion resounded, and then Yang Ye and the young man moved apart. Yang Ye moved around 300m back while the young man merely moved around 150m back.

Clamorous noise resounded throughout the surroundings.

Many demon beasts had witnessed Yang Ye’s battle in the Spatial Battlefield. It could be said that as far as they were concerned, Yang Ye was a candidate for the top three. So, many demon beasts were watching Yang Ye’s battle. However, they hadn’t expected Yang Ye to be at a disadvantage in this collision!

Man Shi and the others had puzzled expressions on their faces. Obviously, they didn’t understand why Yang Ye had lost the collision.

The black robed young man was delighted, and he shot towards Yang Ye.

In the following collisions, the black robed young man always had the upper hand over Yang Ye. No, he didn’t just have the upper hand, he was completely suppressing Yang Ye. At this moment, Yang Ye seemed like he couldn’t fight back at all.

It didn’t take long for many demon beasts to start cheering for the black robed young man. As they cheered, the black robed young man grew more and more excited, and he felt more and more energetic!

A short while later, Yang Ye suddenly sent the young man a voice transmission, “Your 15 minutes are up!”

The black robed young man was stunned. At this moment, his mind cleared up slightly, and he glanced at Yang Ye. Right now, he was quite doubtful. He doubted Yang Ye’s strength. Because he felt that Yang Ye was using his full strength when fighting him just now. Simply speaking, he felt that he could defeat Yang Ye!

He’d clearly lost his ability to think clearly in the heat of the battle. Because he’d forgotten how Yang Ye fought in the Spatial Battlefield that day. Or perhaps, he’d unconsciously chosen to forget it! Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

A short moment of silence ensued before the young man suddenly said, “I’m not admitting defeat anymore!”

Yang Ye was stunned, “You’re going back on your word?”

The young man replied, “What are you talking about? Cut the crap and fight me!”

Bang!

As soon as he finished speaking, he hadn’t even been able to react before a wave of energy slammed against his stomach. He spat out multiple mouthfuls of blood while his figure was blasted away. He flew for around 3km before he finally slammed against the edge of the ring’s defensive barrier.

Boom!

The barrier of light shook violently. The young man’s figure crashed to the ground, and then his body twitched for a while before he fell unconscious.

All the demon beasts here were stunned. Yang Ye had been completely suppressed just a moment ago, yet now, the young man had been defeated in an instant.

The turn of events had been too sudden!

Yang Ye glanced at the young man, and then he shook his head. He’d displayed weakness to help the young man maintain his dignity, but the young man felt that he was really weak!

So, wasn’t the young man just asking to be beaten up?

Meanwhile, Gu Mo appeared on the ring. He glanced at Yang Ye and said, “The Goat Clan’s Xiao Yang is victorious!”

He paused for a moment and said, “Go take a rest. The next fight you face won’t be this easy!”

Yang Ye cupped his fist towards Gu Mo, “Thank you for the reminder, Elder!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye leaped off the ring.

Man Shi, Kuang Jing, and Hu Meng immediately went over to Yang Ye. Man Shi smiled, “Congratulations!”

Yang Ye smiled, “Good luck to all of you!”

They nodded. As far as they were concerned, they didn’t hope for much, so the pressure they experienced wasn’t that heavy. Especially Hu Meng, he was satisfied that he had been able to enter the third round.

After this, the competition grew more and more intense. Unfortunately, Hu Meng was eliminated in his first battle. Even though Hu Meng was rather disappointed by this, he wasn’t dejected. Because he was able to learn what he lacked, so he just had to work hard on it and he could improve himself!

Even though Hu Meng had been eliminated, Man Shi and Kuang Jing had won their first battles.

However, their luck didn’t last for long. A day later, Man Shi and Kuang Jing were eliminated. Man Shi got into the top ten like he wanted while Kuang Jing was ranked at the 12th position. But both of them were very satisfied.

Another day later, the top two in both groups were decided.

They were the Dark Scorpion Clan’s Ku Moye, the Blue Bird Clan’s Yan Lingxue, the Devil Ape Clan’s Ku Yuan, and the Blood Wolf Clan’s Xue You. Yang Ye’s opponent would be one of them!

On the ring, Gu Mo glanced at the four of them and said, “Draw your lots. The one who draws lot number one will fight the Goat Clan’s Xiao Yang!”

“There’s no need for that!” Meanwhile, Xue You suddenly stepped forward, “I’ll do it!”

Yang Ye glanced at Xue You. I don’t think I have enmity with him!

Gu Mo asked, “Are you sure?”

Xue You nodded, “I am!”

Gu Mo glanced at Ku Moye and the others, “Do all of you have any objections?”

Gu Moye replied indifferently, “None!”

The Blue Bird Clan’s Yan Lingxue shook her head while Ku Yuan glanced at Xue You, “None!”

Gu Mo nodded, and then he gazed at Yang Ye, “What about you? If you object, we can still draw lots to decide your opponent.”

This could be considered as displaying kindness to Yang Ye. Because it was obvious that the Blood Wolf Clan’s Xue You was targeting Yang Ye.

Yang Ye glanced at Xue You, “I have no objections!”

Gu Mo hesitated for a moment and nodded, “Since everyone has no objections, then you can begin. The winner stays and the loser will be eliminated!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Gu Mo vanished on the spot.

Xue You said, “Do you remember that huge black bull you bashed up in the Spatial Battlefield?”

Huge black bull? Yang Ye was stunned and thought for a moment. It didn’t take long for him to recall the black bull. Xue You was talking about the black bull who called him a coward in the Spatial Battlefield.

Yang Ye gazed at Xue You, “You know him?”

Xue You nodded, “He’s a friend of mine. He should have been able to advance, but he was forced to withdraw in advance because of you.”

Yang Ye said, “So, you’re here to avenge him?”

Xue You nodded, “You’re strong, so I didn’t want to waste my energy on you before this. Yet now, I think we can fight.”

Yang Ye shrugged, “Then attack!”

Xue You said, “Return to your true form!”

Yang Ye shook his head, “That isn’t necessary!”

Xue You gazed at Yang Ye for a long time and said, “You’re very confident, but trust me, you…”

“I said you can attack, so just do it! You just have to waste time!” Yang Ye shook his head, “Since it’s like that, I’ll attack instead!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye instantly appeared in front of Xue You, and then he slammed his fist forward.

Xue You didn’t return to his true form as well, and he similarly slammed a punch in Yang Ye’s direction.

Bang!

As soon as their fists came into contact, both of them immediately split apart. But it only took a moment for Yang Ye to press forward again and swing his fist at Xue You.

It didn’t take long for Xue You to be pushed back repeatedly. In just a short while, Xue You had been pushed to the edge of the ring, and Yang Ye was slamming him against the barrier of light.

At this moment, all the demon beasts had solemn expressions on their faces, and it included the other three geniuses in the top four. They had extremely solemn expressions on their faces.

Roar!

Suddenly, Xue You’s figure shook, and then a huge and completely blood red wolf appeared in front of Yang Ye.

Xue You roared with fury and said, “Return to your true form!”

Yang Ye shook his head, “It isn’t necessary, it really isn’t.”

Xue You’s face was instantly covered in fury, “Are you looking down on me?”

Yang Ye didn’t know what to say in response.

Meanwhile, Xue You added, “Hurry! Return to your true form and have a fair fight with me!”

Yang Ye suddenly seemed to be infuriated by this, “I told you that it isn’t necessary! So it isn’t necessary! I don't need to return to my true form to fight you! This is more than enough!”

All the spectators were rendered speechless by this.
