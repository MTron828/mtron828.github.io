Chapter 2471 – The Old Man with the Bamboo Chest!

It was an old man who was approaching.

The old man with the bamboo chest!

The old man held a bamboo cane with a white cloth hanging from the top of it. On the cloth were pitch black characters—‘公平’!

Fairness!

The old man with a bamboo chest!

Yang Ye hurriedly made Snowy come outside once he saw the old man.

When Snowy appeared outside, she was still holding a small piece of meat in her claws. She’d been eating just now! But she shuddered as soon as she saw the old man, and the old man was stunned when he saw Yang Ye and Snowy.

A moment later, the old man turned around and left. However, Yang Ye was quick to react and arrived before the old man on his sword. He hurriedly bowed and said, “Senior!”

Meanwhile, Snowy had gone over to the bamboo chest, and she was holding tightly to it. Meanwhile, something seemed to be conversing with Snowy from within the bamboo chest and wanted to come outside.

The old man’s face darkened, “Do we know each other?”

Yang Ye smiled embarrassedly, “Senior, you must be joking!”

The old man’s face remained dark, “Kid, I’m not joking. We don’t know each other!”

As he spoke, he turned around and walked away. However, Snowy suddenly patted the bamboo chest, and it immediately shook while something seemed to be on the verge of escaping it!

The old man glanced at Snowy, and the latter blinked and pointed at the bamboo chest. She was telling him to leave it here!

The old man’s face darkened, “Mine!”

Snowy pointed at the bamboo chest and pointed at herself.

The old man immediately stomped his feet, “What? Yours? Tell me how the heck that is yours?”

Snowy blinked, pointed at the bamboo chest, then pointed at the old man. She was asking him to tell her how it was his!

The old man was stunned, and then a short while passed before he gazed at Yang Ye, “Is she asking me to prove that it’s mine?”

Yang Ye nodded.

The old man was furious, “This is mine! How the heck am I supposed to prove that?!”

Snowy suddenly leaped up and pointed at the bamboo chest, and then she pointed at herself to say that it was hers!

The old man’s beard shook with rage, “Little fellow, are you trying to be shameless here?!”

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and said, “Senior, I think this isn’t very fair!”

It wasn’t fair!

The old man gazed at Yang Ye, “What are you trying to say, kid?”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and pointed at Snowy, “Senior, I’m sure you know who she is, right?”

The old man puckered his lips, “Some may think she’s the Sprite Progenitor, but others think she’s just a shameless rogue!”

Snowy was stunned speechless.Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Yang Ye smiled embarrassedly and spoke seriously, “In the heart of the Sprite Progenitor, all things have life, and they are without owner. Or I should say that everything belongs to whomever the thing chooses to go with. The bamboo chest is yours, but she thinks that it’s hers. So, how about you allow the bamboo chest to choose itself and see who it wants to go with, alright?”

The old man started laughing from rage, “I was wondering why she was so shameless, so it’s because she’s following a worse one! Why should I let my things choose? Why don’t you make your things choose? You…”

As soon as he spoke up to this point, Yang Ye had already withdrawn all his Divine Treasures, including the Super Divine Treasure, Executor.

The old man was stunned.

Yang Ye spoke seriously, “Senior, you’re right. For fairness’ sake, I should let mine choose first!”

He gazed at all the treasures, “All of you can choose. I guarantee with my character that if you choose to go with this senior, I will not stop you! I will allow you to do as you want!”

The treasures trembled slightly, and then the old man watched with shock as they flew to Snowy.

All of them chose Snowy!

Snowy cracked a very brilliant smile. Of course they would choose her. After all, she performed Sprite Ascension on them every day!

Snowy and Yang Ye gazed at the old man to display that it was the old man’s turn.

The old man pointed at them, “Shameless! Both of you are terribly shameless!”

Meanwhile, Snowy withdrew a fruit and raised it before the old man, and then she pointed at it.

The Chaotic Fruit!

The old man was stunned, and then he asked, “You still have it? Wait! This is much larger than the fruits I gave you, and they are riper. They aren’t the fruits I gave you. Where did you get them?”

Snowy pointed at herself!

The old man was speechless and gazed at Yang Ye. Yang Ye said, “She used the seeds of those two fruits!”

“Impossible!” The old man shook his head, “That’s absolutely impossible, absolutely…”

He suddenly gazed at Snowy.

Wait a minute! It’s absolutely impossible for other people, but it’s very possible for that little fellow! She’s a Sprite Progenitor!

The old man hesitated for a moment and asked, “Can I have a look?”

Snowy gazed at Yang Ye, and Yang Ye hesitated for a moment before nodding.

The old man knew everything about him and possessed strength that far surpassed his own. If the old man had ill intent, he couldn’t stop the old man at all! It was a feeling he had!

Just like that, Yang Ye and Snowy brought the old man into the Primordial Pagoda. At the mountain behind the Sword Sect, the old man clicked his tongue with admiration when he saw the trees, “It’s absolutely inconceivable that they actually are Chaotic Fruit Trees! No miracle is impossible in this world!” He gazed at Snowy and gave her a thumbs up, “Amazing, truly amazing!”

Snowy cracked a smile and sneaked a glance at the old man’s bamboo chest.

The old man glanced at the surroundings and said, “This is a small world, right?”

Yang Ye nodded.

The old man glanced at the trees before him, hesitated for a moment, and said, “They are of too high level. If they stay here, this world won’t be able to accommodate them. Soon, their energy will start damaging this world.”

Meanwhile, Snowy appeared before the trees. She pointed at them to say that they were hers!

The old man grinned, “Don’t worry, I won’t take them. If they leave you, it will only take a while for them to wither and die. Even Eternal Kingdom cannot keep them alive without you!”

He glanced at the surroundings and said, “This world can be fortified a little!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he raised his hands slightly. In an instant, the world within the pagoda started to tremble, and then Yang Ye and Snowy watched with astonishment as the space here started to undergo a tremendous change.

The structure of space and all matter was changing!

This scene shocked everyone within the pagoda!

Even Yang Ye, An Nanjing, and Sword Scroll were shocked, and Sword Scroll’s eyes were filled with disbelief as she gazed at the old man! Because she noticed that the world was changing! It was gradually changing from a small world into something else!

Now, the world was a low-level world, and it was still changing!

Around an hour later, the old man stopped.

He glanced at the surroundings and nodded slightly, “A mid-level world. It’s barely sufficient to sustain their growth.”

A mid-level world!

He’d transformed a small world into a mid-level world just like the Desolate World all on his own. So, who was the old man? How strong was he?

All of them were absolutely shocked by this!

The old man glanced at them and said, “It’s just a little trick. There’s nothing to be shocked about.”

Yang Ye laughed bitterly, “Senior, that was no trick!”

A mid-level world!

Yang Ye laughed bitterly because the old man’s strength simply exceeded his imagination. How strong did someone have to be in order to forcefully transform a world?

The old man didn’t say anything. He gazed at Snowy and sighed softly, “Perhaps this is fate. As for the bamboo chest, I cannot give it to you. But since there’s fate between us, and you’re a sprite of absolute kindness and purity, I have to give you something. You won’t let me leave otherwise too.”

He flicked a ray of white light into Snowy’s forehead.

Yang Ye hurriedly asked, “What was that?”

The old man replied, “A strand of energy. It will be released when she encounters danger that she cannot deal with. It may be of help to her!”

However, Snowy’s gaze still remained on the bamboo chest!

The old man laughed bitterly, “Little fellow, you just won’t stop eying these few treasures of mine.” He stretched out his right hand and patted the small bamboo chest.

A crimson red fruit appeared before Snowy. Snowy blinked, touched it, and looked up at the old man.

The old man smiled, “That’s a Worldborn Fruit, it’s a fruit born from the world. It’s more potent than the Chaotic Fruit. I don’t have many. You can have that, and if you can, you can grow more.”

Snowy sniffed the fruit, and then she put it away. However, her gaze shot toward the bamboo chest again.

The old man laughed bitterly, “Please, I don’t have much. Just take that and spare me, alright?”

Snowy remained silent.

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and rubbed Snowy’s head, “Hurry up and thank him!”

One should know when to stop!

Snowy glanced at the old man, and then waved lightly at the old man. The old man smiled, “Fine, fine. Fate brought us together twice, it is quite unusual, but it still is fate.”

As he spoke, he put the bamboo chest down and withdrew a fist-sized seal from it.

Yang Ye hurriedly asked, “What’s that?”

The old man smiled, “The Universe Seal. It can destroy all formations, barriers, and Universe Walls I know of. Of course, most importantly…”
