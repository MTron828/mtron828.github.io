Chapter 2740 – Fight to the End!

On the mountain top, Yang Ye and Su Qingshi embraced each other and they looked off into the distance. They didn’t speak and just held each other. However, because of what he’d said, the entire Eternal Kingdom was in a clamor.

What did Eternal Kingdom lack the most right now?

Spirit energy, of course!

The experts from all over the universe had rushed over here for spirit energy!

Yang Ye had taken the divine vein, and that had obviously made him the most hated person in the universe.

But Yang Ye hadn’t done as he’d done in the past. He would usually choose to ignore such a situation, and he wouldn’t mind even becoming enemies with the entire universe!

But this time, he didn’t choose to ignore it all!

Because if he did that, it would be exactly what the End World wanted. The End World had intentionally laid a trap for him, and so he planned to use it against them.

He wanted to see who would place the final trap!

Of course, it would be a difficult battle.

Because he wouldn’t be running anymore!

He chose to fight the End World to the end!

…

The Central Prefecture. A grand hall.

Huang Ying and the others were gathered together once more.

The representatives of many powers throughout the universe were here. The reason they hadn’t gone with the End World was mainly because the End World didn’t want them!

The End World only accepted experts at the Destiny Realm!

Huang Ying glanced at them and said, “What do you think of Yang Ye’s declaration?”

The hall remained silent.

Huang Ying spoke indifferently, “What? No one has an opinion?”

Suddenly, an old man stepped forward and spoke solemnly, “Yang Ye doesn’t just have the divine vein, he has the Sprite Progenitor. Even though what he said about an endless supply of spirit energy may be slightly exaggerated, so long as nothing happens to the divine vein and Sprite Progenitor, I believe that the spirit energy there will probably never vanish even after we die of old age.”

Die of old age!

Many chuckled.

The old man was a Destiny Realm expert. So, it would take tens of thousands of years for him to die of old age!

Of course, when it came to some of the old geezers who entered into closed door cultivation for hundreds or thousands of years, a few tens of thousands of years wasn’t a very long time.

The old man continued, “However, Yang Ye clearly wants to bind us with him, and if we are bound with him, we have to face the End World, or bind ourselves to the End World and deal with Yang Ye. We may have to choose between Yang Ye and the End World. Of course, if we wish to do nothing and stay out of it, we can leave Eternal Kingdom now and return to where we came from.”

The others fell silent.

A choice!

They had to make a choice. It was impossible to wait for them to fight and reap the rewards!

Both Yang Ye and the End World wouldn’t allow them to do that!

Suddenly, a beautiful woman spoke, “I think we should choose the End World!”

Huang Ying gazed at her, and she said, “Yang Ye Is all alone. If we take his side and fight the End World, I think it’s very unwise. But the End World is different because they have countless experts. If we are included, Yang Ye wouldn’t have a chance to fight back. Conversely, if we take Yang Ye’s side, we’ll only have a 50% chance of success. Moreover, the End World has always been very mysterious. Who knows if they have a backup plan?”

Huang Ying remained silent.

Meanwhile, the old man from before spoke abruptly, “I see things differently.”

The others gazed at the old man, and he spoke solemnly, “Firstly, we’ve been in contact with the End World. When the two are compared, the End World is capable of anything. Yang Ye won’t target us if we don’t offend him, but the same can’t be said about the End World. I’m sure you’ve seen how they treated us previously. They wanted the divine vein, and if we stopped them, they would kill us without the slightest hesitation.”

He shook his head and continued, “Besides that, the End World looks down upon all of us. Or to be more frank, even if we join the End World, we’ll just be cannon fodder for them.”

Huang Ying nodded slightly, and it could be considered as a display of his agreement.

It wasn’t just Huang Ying, many others were in agreement with the old man.

Actually, if it was possible, they would rather side with the End World. Even the old man was the same. Because just as the beautiful woman had said, the End World had numerous experts, but Yang Ye was all alone. He really didn’t have an advantage.

However, the End World looked down on them.

They could feel it!

Conversely, Yang Ye was quite humane. At the very least, it was obvious from how he treated the Ancient Sword Sect.

Meanwhile, the beautiful woman suddenly said, “But you know Yang Ye’s character. He’s bloodthirsty. Can you guarantee that he won’t use us as cannon fodder, just like the End World would?”

The old man glanced at the woman and said, “Have you still not realized the situation? It isn’t the End World or Yang Ye who needs us, it’s we who need them. To be frank, if any one of them admits defeat. For example, if Yang Ye flees to the 9th layer of space, could the End World do anything to him? What could we do about that? It isn’t that they need us, it’s we who need them.”

The woman spoke indifferently, “If they don’t need us, they wouldn’t do all of this. Both the End World and Yang Ye are gathering help, aren’t they?”

The old man replied, “They are. But let me be frank, they are still strong even without us, and they aren’t forces we can afford to offend.”

The beautiful woman fell silent.

It was the truth!

Both Yang Ye and the End World weren’t existences they could afford to offend.

Suddenly, someone said, “Everyone, it actually isn’t such a difficult choice. Don’t forget that Yang Ye has the Sprite Progenitor!”

As soon as these words were spoken, the hall instantly fell silent.

The Sprite Progenitor!

Yang Ye had the Sprite Progenitor!

They had overlooked that during their conversation.

Spirit energy!

They had taken Eternal Kingdom for spirit energy, and Yang Ye had the Sprite Progenitor while the End World didn’t!

Meanwhile, the voice added, “Yang Ye destroyed the End World a few times now, so they probably don’t even have much spirit energy left for themselves. But every one of us has a family, sect, or clan to take care of. Just think about it, would the End World allow those who depend on us to join the End World too? Will they protect the people you wish to protect?”Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

The voice paused for a moment at this point and continued, “Most importantly, if we choose the End World, Yang Ye will definitely choose to run. The entire End World has been trying to capture Yang Ye for so long yet failed, so will they succeed just because they have our help? At that time, once he flees with the Sprite Progenitor and divine vein, we will just be working for the End World and getting nothing in return. Moreover, the End World isn’t ordinary. Our lives may even be at risk there. After all, they are capable of anything!”

The others in the hall fell silent for some time. Suddenly, the old man gazed at Huang Ying, “Patriarch Huang, you decide!”

Huang Ying fell silent for a short while and said, “We have three choices before us. Firstly, join the End World. Secondly, join Yang Ye and create that paradise city with him. Of course, we may have to pay a price because if we choose to protect the city with him, we’re bound to go head on against the End World. Thirdly, we leave Eternal Kingdom and return to where we came from!”

He glanced at the people here and said, “Those who choose the third option can leave now. My desolate race will not stop you.”

After a period of silence, some people left.

However, it wasn’t many of them. Only a few had left.

Huang Ying really didn’t stop them.

Once no one else left, Huang Ying continued, “Now, those who choose the End World can leave too.”

Everyone here gazed at Huang Ying. Obviously, they knew his choice.

No one in the hall moved.

Huang Ying spoke softly, “Everyone, I’ve had some contact with Yang Ye, and I was good friends with him once. Of course, we’re not good friends anymore. As for the reason, it’s because my desolate race used some tactics that weren’t very friendly to make him help us with Eternal Kingdom during our attack. What I’m trying to say is that putting our trust in him is definitely better than putting our trust in the End World.”

As he spoke, he gazed at the old man from before, “Senior Yue mentioned many things earlier, so I’ll just add on a little more. Yang Ye is a sword cultivator. If we choose him, then so long as we don’t act against him, he will never scheme against us. It’s something I can guarantee. Besides that, all of you have overlooked something even more important than the Sprite Progenitor, Yang Ye has been chosen by Destiny!”

Destiny!

Countless people here were stunned, and then they revealed extremely solemn expressions!

Destiny!

That existence who’d once just been an ethereal existence to them!

Even the End World feared Destiny!

The End World dared to hunt Yang Ye, but they would never dare to hunt Destiny! At the very least, they didn’t dare to right now!

Huang Ying added, “To a certain extent, choosing him represents taking Destiny’s side.”

The hall fell silent.

A short while passed before they seemed to have made a decision, and then numerous orders were sent out!

Even though there were only a few people in the hall, all of them represented different powers, and these powers of theirs had countless other smaller powers subordinate to them…

A single order reached far and wide!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye arrived at Ancient Sword City.

This city which once belonged to the Ancient Sword Sect. But at this moment, it was in ruins!
