Chapter 1993 – Yang Ye’s Bloodline!

Suppressed!

After the tiny vortex started spinning, the god blood was instantly suppressed and couldn’t melt away Yang Ye’s own bloodline.

Uncle Guan frowned, “What’s going on?”

Meanwhile, Zhi’er appeared beside Uncle Guan. Uncle Guan gazed at her with a puzzled expression in his eyes.

God blood was the bloodline of the god race, and while it couldn’t be considered to be the best in the large universe, it was absolutely capable of being ranked in the top three bloodlines. However, he hadn’t expected it to actually be suppressed!

It was inconceivable!

Uncle Guan was absolutely stunned!

Zhi’er gazed at Yang Ye for a long time and said, “There are only two reasons why it could be suppressed. One, his own bloodline is stronger than our god race’s bloodline! Two, his potential is too weak, so the god blood is rejecting him and is forcefully refusing to merge with him.”

Uncle Guan gazed at Yang Ye, “How could his bloodline be better than our god race’s bloodline?”

Zhi’er closed her eyes slowly. She knew that Yang Ye had a treasure in him, and it would only allow things that were beneficial to Yang Ye. Since it refused to let the god blood change Yang Ye’s bloodline, it represented that as far as that treasure was concerned, Yang Ye’s bloodline was better!

Even though Yang Ye was an extraordinary genius and was extremely strong amongst his peers, based on how it was right now, there really wasn’t anything special about Yang Ye’s bloodline.

Meanwhile, Uncle Guan flicked his finger, and a droplet of blood shot out from Yang Ye’s forehead.

Uncle Guan sized up the blood, and then his expression gradually became solemn.

They exchanged glances, and then Uncle Guan spoke solemnly, “I see! His bloodline was suppressed by someone!”

Yang Ye asked, “What’s his bloodline?”

Uncle Guan fell silent for a long time before he shook his head, “I’ve never seen it!”

Zhi’er frowned. She gazed at Yang Ye, “Looks like his background isn’t ordinary at all!”

Meanwhile, Uncle Guan suddenly chuckled, “It isn’t just his background, he himself isn’t ordinary at all. I’m sure you’re aware that when someone attains a certain level of strength, that person’s bloodline can undergo a transformation, just like Lord Shi Tian. As for him, his own clan’s bloodline isn’t ordinary, and his own bloodline is even more extraordinary!”

“His own bloodline?” Zhi’er gazed at Yang Ye. A short while passed before she nodded slightly, “I see.”

Uncle Guan added, “The most interesting part is that his own bloodline is slowly transforming too. His own bloodline, his clan’s bloodline, his past bloodline… His bloodline is advancing over and over again and changing over and over again. He’s a truly interesting little fellow!”

A smile curled up on the corners of Zhi’er’s mouth, “It’s truly interesting indeed!”

Both of them gazed at Yang Ye with a trace of curiosity in their eyes.

Around an hour later, Yang Ye opened his eyes slowly. He immediately stood up and inspected his cultivation.

He was still at the 3rd stage of the Enlightened Realm!

Yang Ye gazed at them with confusion in his eyes.

Uncle Guan grinned, “Sense it carefully once more! See if you notice anything different!”

Yang Ye scanned himself again. It didn’t take long for him to notice that his body was actually filled with strength, and he felt like a river was surging through him.

Yang Ye gazed at Uncle Guan with a puzzled gaze, “What is this?”

Uncle Guan smiled, “While you’re just at the 3rd stage of the Enlightened Realm right now, you can attain the 5th stage of the Enlightened Realm at any time. However, I have a small suggestion. Just leave your cultivation like this. If you encounter a powerful enemy in the future, then raise your cultivation to the 5th stage at the critical moment and you’ll definitely be able to give that person a terribly pleasant surprise!”

How cunning! The corners of Yang Ye’s mouth curled up slightly. This old man’s really cunning! But I like it!

Meanwhile, Uncle Guan added, “Besides that, take a look at your body.”

Yang Ye scanned his body. At this moment, his physical body was much different than it had been.

Uncle Guan explained, “Ordinary See Dao Realm experts can’t harm you at all now. Even Attain Dao Realm experts will probably have a huge headache when facing your physical defenses. Of course, it’s best if you don’t underestimate your opponents. There’s never a lack of geniuses in this world!”

“Of course!” Yang Ye smiled. Because he’d killed many people who were stronger than him.

Underestimating one’s enemy was equivalent to asking for death!

Uncle Guan nodded slightly, “Then let’s start the next part of your tempering!”

Yang Ye gazed at Uncle Guan with astonishment, “We’re still training more?”

Uncle Guan glanced at the surroundings, “You must get through the Asura Grounds on your own. Kid, this is just the beginning. Enjoy your training in hell!”

Uncle Guan vanished on the spot.

Zhi’er sized up Yang Ye and said, “Come back alive or your sword is mine.” She vanished once she finished speaking.

The Asura Grounds!

Yang Ye took a deep breath and glanced at the surroundings. It was completely pitch black. He couldn’t see anything, even if he’d comprehended the Laws of Darkness.

Suddenly, pairs of blood red eyes appeared in the darkness.

Om!

A sword howl resounded, and then 10 energy swords appeared around Yang Ye. They circled him while rays of light intertwined around him! It was terrifying!

At the same time, an ethereal sword overlapped with Yang Ye’s body.

He was a sword!

Yang Ye started walking forward, and it didn’t take long for a pair of blood red eyes to suddenly appear in front of him.

Swish! Swish! Swish! Swish!

Pairs of blood red eyes shot at him from all directions.

Yang Ye’s gaze gradually turned icy cold. He issued a command in his heart, and then energy swords around him suddenly transformed into rays of light that shot forward. At the same time, he transformed into a ray of light that shot towards the distance.

Burial!

It was the first time Yang Ye executed this sword technique after treating himself as a sword. He was executing it with him as the sword!

Yang Ye didn’t know how strong it would be, and he just wanted to try it. However, trying it opened another new door to Yang Ye.

Everywhere the ray of light passed, pair after pair of blood red eyes were sliced into pieces. At the same time, the space in the entire Asura Grounds cracked open.

Outside the Asura Grounds.

Uncle Guan chuckled, “That attack is quite interesting indeed!”

Zhi’er nodded slightly, “His Sword Dao has grown stronger!”

In the Asura Grounds.

A ray of light flashed incessantly through the darkness, and 10 energy swords closely defended the ray of light. The energy swords were linked together by sword energy, causing the blood red eyes in the surroundings to be unable to get close to Yang Ye at all.

Nothing could stop his advance!

Everywhere the ray of light passed, everything was obliterated. However, the pitch black darkness in the Asura Grounds seemed boundless, and no matter how Yang Ye charged forward, the area ahead was still covered in darkness.

Outside the Asura Grounds.

Uncle Guan suddenly said, “It’s about time to send some stronger opponents for him!”

He waved his right hand once he finished speaking.

The scene in the Asura Grounds suddenly changed, and then Yang Ye appeared on a round platform.

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings, and it was completely hazy.

Suddenly, a black shadow appeared in front of him. The black shadow was completely pitch black. Yang Ye couldn’t see the shadow’s face at all, and he could only see an outline.

Swish!

The shadow suddenly vanished on the spot, and it was in front of Yang Ye when it appeared once more. At the same time, a sword stabbed into Yang Ye’s forehead before he could even react.

Blood seeped out!

Fortunately, Yang Ye had reacted when it stabbed into his skin. He grabbed it with his left hand and immobilized it!

It’s fast! Yang Ye exclaimed in his heart.

Suddenly, the shadow before him vanished. An instant later, Yang Ye’s sword vanished from his grasp, and then his pupils constricted. He instinctively moved his head backwards, and a sword flashed past his throat.

Hiss!

Blood seeped out slightly from his throat.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye moved around 30m back. However, as soon as he stopped there, the black shadow suddenly appeared before him, and then a sword stabbed at his forehead.

It was extremely swift!

So swift that Yang Ye couldn’t even react!

Hiss!

Yang Ye was only able to react after the sword stabbed into his skin, and Yang Ye flashed backwards. However, the shadow followed him like it was his own shadow, and rays of light flickered incessantly.

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!

Strings of blood sprayed from Yang Ye. Yang Ye couldn’t dodge any of the attacks, and all he could do was dodge and defend himself at the critical moment, and that was the only reason why he hadn’t been killed until now!

However, he was being utterly suppressed!

The Sword Domain! 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Yang Ye activated the Sword Domain. As soon as he did that, he was able to catch the movements of the black shadow. At the same time, the shadow’s speed was suppressed. Right when Yang Ye was about to attack, a wave of mysterious energy appeared!

The Sword Domain!

Another Sword Domain had appeared here! Two Sword Domains overlapped on each other!

Yang Ye was stunned on the spot!

“That black shadow is formed based on you!” Suddenly, Uncle Guan’s voice resounded in Yang Ye’s mind, “He’s you, so if you suppress him with the Sword Domain, he’ll use the Sword Domain to suppress you too.”

“He’s me?” Yang Ye gazed at the black shadow, “Why is he faster than me?”

Uncle Guan replied with a question, “Do you really think he’s faster than you?”

Yang Ye fell silent.

The black shadow was him, yet it was faster than him?

Obviously, that was impossible!

So, there was only one explanation, and it was that he hadn’t fully utilized his speed or perhaps he wasn’t using his full strength.

My full strength! Yang Ye was instantly enlightened when he thought up to this point.

Yang Ye deactivated the Sword Domain, and so did the black shadow.

A moment later, two rays of light flashed.

Hiss! Hiss!

Something was sliced open.

A breath of time later, Yang Ye lowered his sword, and the black shadow slowly dispersed before him.

Yang Ye grinned, “A fake is nothing more than a fake!”

Suddenly, two black shadows appeared not too far away from him.

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly, “As expected, it really isn’t that easy!”

Around 15 minutes later, both black shadows were killed. However, it didn’t take long for three black shadows to appear before Yang Ye…

Then four!

Then five!

Six...
