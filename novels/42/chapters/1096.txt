Chapter 1097 – The Complete Stellar Ward Technique!

Lin Yueyin felt a little disdain in her heart when she heard Yang Ye. The Mo Clan was one of the 4 great clans of the Central Divine Prefecture, and it was one of the oldest clans. Not to mention White Deer Academy, even the Martial Sect and Devil Path couldn’t compare to its resources and reserves. Yet Yang Ye was just a person with slightly good natural talent. So, Yang Ye was nothing before an ancient clan like the Mo Clan!

Of course, she wasn’t foolish enough to speak those sentiments out loud. She wished for nothing more than to see Yang Ye look for trouble with the Mo Clan. In that way, she could watch Yang Ye suffer a miserable fate.

Meanwhile, Xiao Bieli walked over to Yang Ye’s side and asked softly, “What’s wrong?”

Yang Ye glanced at Xiao Yuxi, and then he turned around to gaze at Xiao Bieli, “Dean Xiao, Yuxi and I are from the same place. Because of certain reasons, she came to the Radiant Dimension before me. However, she has forgotten the past for some unknown reason. Please help me take a look at her!”

Xiao Bieli gazed at Yang Ye and asked, “You’re from the lower dimensions?”

Yang Ye nodded.

“Now I understand!” Xiao Bieli nodded slightly. He pondered deeply for a moment, and then he gazed at Xiao Yuxi. Lin Yueyin was about to speak when Yang Ye glared at her. Her face instantly turned pale, and she didn’t dare speak a word.

Xiao Bieli stretched out a finger and tapped the center of Xiao Yuxi’s forehead. Xiao Yuxi frowned and was about to resist. Meanwhile, Yang Ye said, “Yuxi, do you not want to know everything about your past?”

Xiao Yuxi fell silent for a short while, and then she stopped resisting. Obviously, she wanted to regain that blank part of her memories.

A frown grew slowly on Xiao Bieli’s face, and around 15 minutes passed before he withdrew his hand while a solemn expression had appeared on his face.

Yang Ye hurriedly asked, “How is she?”

Xiao Bieli remained silent for a long time before he replied, “She hasn’t forgotten the past. It’s because her memories have been sealed.”

“It has been sealed!?” Yang Ye’s expression changed, “What’s the consequences of that?”

Xiao Bieli replied, “It’ll harm her foundation!”

Yang Ye’s face turned completely gloomy, “Senior, can you undo the seal?”

Xiao Bieli shook his head, “It was sealed by a special technique. Unless a true Emperor does it, forcefully undoing the seal is very likely to erase all her memories and make her go mad....”

Yang Ye slowly clenched his fists, and a short while passed before he took a deep breath and gazed at Lin Yueyin, “Why did your Thousand Crane Sect seal her memories?”

Lin Yueyin’s expression changed when she saw the expression on Yang Ye’s face. She was truly quite afraid of the madman who stood before her. She was about to speak when Xiao Bieli spoke, “Her memories were probably sealed so that she would completely forget everything before she came here from the lower dimensions. Her natural talent and potential aren’t bad. If she’s fostered well, then she’ll definitely be extraordinary in the future. But if she possesses her memories of the lower dimensions, then it’s very likely that the Thousand Crane Sect would be fostering her for someone else. So, for the same of controlling the geniuses from the lower dimensions, it’s very common for the powers in the Central Divine Prefecture to do things like sealing their memories.”

A wisp of gloominess flashed through Yang Ye’s eyes, “Thousand Crane Sect!”

Xiao Bieli suddenly asked, “What’s her relationship to you?”

Yang Ye said, “She’s my wife!”

Xiao Yuxi glanced at Yang Ye and remained silent.

Xiao Bieli’s expression changed when he heard Yang Ye, and then he said, “This is quite difficult to deal with.”

Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly said, “Let me and Yuxi talk privately!”

Xiao Bieli glanced at Yang Ye, and then he nodded and vanished on the spot.

Yang Ye gazed at Lin Yueyin and said, “Do you want me to make you fuck off?”

Lin Yueyin glanced at Yang Ye. She didn’t dare provoke him further, and she immediately led the other members of the Thousand Crane Sect away.

Yang Ye walked over to Xiao Yuxi and said, “Yuxi, I know all your secrets, I know everything you like, and I know everything about you. What does that prove? It proves that you really were my wife.” FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Yang Ye started to tell her everything that had occurred between them in Profounder Continent.

A long time passed before Yang Ye finished speaking, and Xiao Yuxi remained silent.

She gazed at him for a short while before she said, “I’m really lost. I don’t know who I was, and I don’t know what I want in the future. You say that I’m your wife, and I know that you might not be lying. Because you know many things that even I don’t, and all of those things are very real. Perhaps I really loved you in the past. Yet now, I don’t feel like that. Don’t use my past which I don’t remember to pressure me right now, alright?”

Yang Ye stretched out his hand and stroked her hair lightly, and he spoke softly, “Alright, I won’t. Don’t worry, no one will be able to force you to do anything you don’t like. Regardless of whether it’s the Thousand Crane Sect or the Mo Clan.”

Xiao Yuxi said, “I’m going back!”

Yang Ye asked, “Can you not?”

Xiao Yuxi replied, “If I don’t, then you’ll become the joint enemy of the Thousand Crane Sect and Mo Clan.”

Yang Ye was slightly stunned when he heard her, and then he was overjoyed, “You’re worried about me. Yuxi, you’re worried about me.... Hahaha! I knew that while you’ve lost your memories, how could you possibly feel nothing for me? Hahaha!”

Xiao Yuxi didn’t know what to say.

Yang Ye laughed for a while before he spoke, “Not to mention the Thousand Crane Sect and the Mo Clan, I’m not afraid of making enemies with the entire world for you.”

Xiao Yuxi gazed at Yang Ye for a long time. In the end, she flipped her palm, and a saber that was thin like the wings of a cicada appeared in her hand.

Sheerwing! Yang Ye immediately recognized the saber because it was the exact same saber that he’d given her all those years ago.

Xiao Yuxi gazed at the saber for a long time before she said, “Since I remember, this saber has always been with me. I’ve thought of throwing it away on many occasions, but I never did. You said that you gave me a saber once. If I’m not wrong, it’s this saber, right?”

Yang Ye nodded.

Xiao Yuxi gazed at him and said, “I really want to know what happened in the past. Give me some time.”

A wisp of tenderness flashed through Yang Ye’s eyes, and he said, “Don’t force yourself too hard. Take it slow. As for the Thousand Crane Sect and Mo Clan, leave them to me.”

Xiao Yuxi gazed at Yang Ye. A wisp of complicated emotions flashed through her eyes, and then she nodded.

It didn’t take long for Xiao Yuxi and the others to leave under Lin Yueyin’s lead.

Yang Ye stood silently on the spot as he looked at the direction they’d left towards.

“This matter is quite difficult to deal with!” Meanwhile, Xiao Bieli appeared by Yang Ye’s side, “Mo Yuntian is a member of the Law Faction. It wouldn’t be a problem if that was all there is to it. But the problem is that he’s also a member of the Mo Clan. The Mo Clan is one of the 4 great clans of the Central Divine Prefecture, and it’s one of the oldest clans here as well. If our White Deer Academy hadn’t split apart, then we wouldn’t have to fear them. Yet now....”

He paused for a moment and continued, “The most important factor is the Thousand Crane Sect’s attitude towards all of this. They’ve wanted to unite her and Mo Yuntian for a very long time. In other words, it’s the joint intention of the Mo Clan and the Thousand Crane Sect to unite them. If we interfere, we’ll become the joint enemies of the Mo Clan and the Thousand Crane Sect!”

Yang Ye asked, “Does the Thousand Crane Sect intend to gain a spirit vein or form a relationship with the Mo Clan by pairing her with that fellow, Mo Yuntian?”

Xiao Bieli replied, “Both!”

Yang Ye nodded and said, “Dean Xiao, what do you think about the future of White Deer Academy?”

Xiao Bieli gazed at Yang Ye, “What are you trying to say?”

Yang Ye said, “Presently, White Deer Academy can be said to have fallen to rock bottom. If it really intends to develop, it would probably be impossible without a few hundred years of time. It’s even to the extent that the slightest mishap might cause it to be unable to get back up and fall into a complete and utter decline before being taken over by others. I’m sure you won’t deny that, right?”

Xiao Bieli nodded.

Yang Ye looked Xiao Bieli in the eyes and said, “Special times require special methods.”

“What are you trying to say!” Xiao Bieli spoke in a low voice. He had a bad feeling about it.

Yang Ye replied, “I hope that Dean Xiao will head to the Thousand Crane Sect with me to propose to her!”

Xiao Bieli was slightly stunned, and then he laughed bitterly, “You intend to make White Deer Academy openly confront the Mo Clan!”

Yang Ye said, “There is a benefit. It will allow the world and the students of the academy to know that while our academy has split apart, we haven’t lost our guts, and we aren’t afraid of any Diamond Rank power. All that’s lacking right now is our reputation. Because I can imagine that many people and powers are laughing at us right now. Why are they laughing? They are laughing because our academy has suffered a decline. But we can use facts to tell them that we haven’t! Our White Deer Academy doesn’t fear anyone or any power!”

Xiao Bieli fell silent.

Yang Ye continued, “Of course, my own selfish motives are included within everything I just said. Because I want the academy to be my shield. If the academy refuses, I won’t blame you. After all, it’s my own personal business. However, I will leave the academy and take her with me to the Martial Sect, Devil Path, or another Diamond Rank power. I’m not threatening you. It’s just that if the academy refuses to support me, then it’s my last and only way out!”

Xiao Bieli remained silent for a long time, and then he patted Yang Ye lightly on the shoulder before he turned around and left. A moment later, his voice resounded from afar, “I’ll head to the Thousand Crane Sect with you in 3 days.”

“Thank you!” Yang Ye felt slightly at ease. If he didn’t have White Deer Academy’s support, then he would really have no choice but to take her and flee. He was naturally clearly aware how terrifying a Diamond Rank power was. Not to mention anything else, just the Law Faction was a sufficient example. If there was no conflict between the Law Faction and the Scholarly Faction, and if the Law Faction didn’t fight him in single combat, then he would have no chance to win.

So, he had no choice but to seek White Deer Academy’s help to save Xiao Yuxi. Moreover, it was the wisest choice as well. Of course, he didn’t mind doing it by force!

Meanwhile, Fang Yun walked over to Yang Ye’s side, and then he passed a scroll to Yang Ye, “This is the full version of the Stellar Ward Technique. It was the Dean who asked me to give it to you. He said that it’s best if you cultivate it as soon as possible, or you might not be able to return alive.”

Yang Ye was speechless.

After he bid farewell to Fang Yun, Yang Ye returned to his room and unrolled the scroll. He was instantly stunned upon taking a glance at it.

“It doesn’t have a grade? Is this a joke....”
