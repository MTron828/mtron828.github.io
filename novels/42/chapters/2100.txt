Chapter 2101 – Venting!

A middle aged man with black hair and violet pupils stood not too far away from Yang Ye, and he was holding Yang Ye’s sword.

Yang Ye coughed lightly, and some blood seeped out from the corner of his mouth. A moment of silence ensued, and then Yang Ye looked up at the middle aged man and took a step forward.

The Sword Domain!

The powerful Sword Domain instantly enveloped the entire area. At the same time, Yang Ye raised his hands lightly, and then around 200 ethereal swords gradually appeared here.

“Die!” Yang Ye’s voice resounded through the area.

In an instant, the entire area was covered in rays of light.

At this moment, the middle aged man looked up at Yang Ye, and he frowned when he saw the rays of light. He took a step forward and tapped his finger at the rays of light.

Just that made the rays of light turn ethereal.

Suddenly, a dragon roar resounded, and then Elysium appeared in Yang Ye’s grasp. After that, he stomped his right foot down and charged at the middle aged man.

When he was around 30m away from the middle aged man, flames suddenly swept out from him, and they only took an instant to envelop Yang Ye and Elysium.

At this instant, the ocean water in the surroundings was boiling.

The Sword Domain, Elysium, the Divine Yin Flame, and the Sky Dragon!

This time, Yang Ye was really fighting with everything he had.

The middle aged man’s frown deepened from the sight of this. He clearly didn’t dare to act carelessly when facing this attack. He twisted his right hand forward, and an ethereal shield appeared before him.

Boom!

As soon as Elysium struck the shield, a loud explosion resounded, and then a wave of powerful force swept through the surroundings, sending ripples through the ocean.

The middle aged man was blasted over 1km away. At the same time, threads of blood seeped out from him. His body had been cracked open!

Yang Ye’s attack was something that even a Sage wouldn’t dare to rashly resist!

The middle aged man’s face fell, and then he stretched out his right hand and clawed at Yang Ye from afar. A wave of force instantly enveloped Yang Ye, but as soon as it enveloped Yang Ye, Yang Ye waved Elysium and destroyed it.

It was clearly impossible for Sages to suppress him with their auras now.

The middle aged man clearly intended to attack again, but the woman in a white dress suddenly said, “Enough!”

The middle aged man gazed at her, “Do you have any right to give me orders?”

Suddenly, she vanished on the spot.

The middle aged man’s expression changed drastically, and he was about to attack. However, countless rays of starlight suddenly converged above him, and then a terrifying pressure pressed down upon him.

Crack!

Yang Ye heard the sound of bones breaking.

However, the middle aged man would clearly not just stand there and wait for death to arrive. He was about to attack when a furious shout resounded, “I dare you to try!”

Yang Ye turned around, and he saw a petite woman and an old man walking over slowly.

Zhi’er!

It was Zhi’er, and Yang Ye had met the old man too. It was Uncle Guan who’d sent him into the Asura Grounds.

The middle aged man’s face fell upon catching sight of Zhi’er, “You… you’re the Junior Patriarch!”

Uncle Guan suddenly said, “She’s the Patriarch now!”

The middle aged man’s face was quite unsightly, “What about Young Master Shi Yu?”

“He’s dead!” Zhi’er suddenly spoke, “I killed him myself!”

The middle aged man spoke angrily, “He’s your older brother!”

“How dare you!” Suddenly, Uncle Guan vanished on the spot.

Bang!

The middle aged man was blasted over 3km away. At the same time, four white robed old men appeared around the middle aged man.

All of them were Sages!

Zhi’er walked slowly towards the middle aged man, “Wanting to be the patriarch wasn’t wrong. His mistake was joining forces with outsiders. If he hadn’t colluded with outsiders, would our god race have fallen to this state?”

Meanwhile, she stopped, “You’re one of the three Ancients of my god race. We didn’t save you to get even with you. My father entrusted that thing to the three of you. Now, I’m here to take it back.”

The middle aged man seemed hesitant.

“You want to play some kind of trick?” She spoke indifferently, “While my god race needs experts now, you don’t make a big difference. So, don’t test my patience.”

The auras of the Sages around him locked onto him.

The middle aged man remained silent for a short while. In the end, he flipped his palm, and a golden key appeared in his grasp.

Zhi’er waved her hand lightly, and it flew into her grasp. She put it away, and then waved her right hand again. The sword in the middle aged man’s grasp flew over to her, and then she tapped it. It immediately went over to Yang Ye.

Zhi’er walked over to Yang Ye, sized him up, and said, “If a day comes when you have nowhere to go in the large universe, come to my god race.”

She turned around and walked away once she finished speaking. But it only took a short while for her to stop again, “I don’t want to use you, and I’ve never had such thoughts. Moreover, while you’re a monstrous genius, you can’t affect the overall situation in the large universe.”

She didn’t speak further and just vanished into the distance.

Meanwhile, the women in a white dress appeared by Yang Ye’s side, “It won’t take long for all the races to converge together and discuss about dealing with my god race. However, it’s not something you should be worried about. You should be worried about the fact that their attention may move to you after they converge together. After all, you possess two precious treasures of the large universe, and there’s enmity between you and them. So long as they’re given the chance, they won’t let it go!”

Yang Ye spoke in a low voice, “I know.”

She continued, “My god race will remain silent for now. So, their gazes will converge on you. Anyway, be careful.”

She vanished into the distance once she finished speaking.

Only Yang Ye and the middle aged man remained here.

A long time passed before Yang Ye decided to leave. But the middle aged man suddenly asked, “What are Elysium and that sword doing in your possession?”

Yang Ye glanced at him, “It’s none of your business!” Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Yang Ye turned around and left.

He’d helped the middle aged man, yet the latter had attacked him. That made him feel extremely annoyed. So, he naturally wouldn’t treat the middle aged man nicely.

The middle aged man’s expression was extremely unsightly. He was about to attack, but he seemed to fear something and didn’t do it in the end.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye had left.

Yang Ye didn’t attack as well because he couldn’t kill the middle aged man. Of course, it was quite difficult for the middle aged man to kill him too. Since none of them could kill the other, he didn’t want to waste his time.

Once he left the ocean, Yang Ye went to Hidden Dragon City, and he received a transmission from Yang Lianshuang.

It was a report about the situation!

After the Confucianist Progenitor stepped forward, the god race’s scheme was exposed.

Rage!

All the other races were furious. Because they had lost too many Sages. It was a terrible loss, a loss that truly affected them severely. So, how could they not be furious? Unfortunately, none of them dared to go after the god race.

No race was without fear towards the former supreme overlord of the large universe.

So, they started to contact each other.

An alliance!

Even though they hadn’t formed an alliance yet, based on Yang Lianshuang’s estimations, they would definitely form one soon. Once they joined forces, the large universe would be split into three. The four paths, the races, and the god race.

However, the god race vanished.

The other races couldn’t find the god race at all, and it was like they’d evaporated into thin air.

Something worth pondering was the attitude of the four paths. They actually remained silent towards the reappearance of the god race. So, as far as the other races were concerned, it was a sign that they didn’t wish to interfere.

Since the four paths refused to interfere, the races had to join forces. Because none of them could fight the god race alone.

The large universe once had over 100 races, yet now, they had gradually vanished or were annihilated. So, at this point in time, there were only a few dozen races left. Even then, they weren’t a force that just the god race could resist on its own. So, they’d vanished.

That wasn’t the main point, the main point was Yang Ye!

Because once they joined forces, their first order was to put a bounty on Yang Ye!

Yang Ye!

Yang Ye was furious when he heard this, “Why?”

He naturally asked Yang Lianshuang that question.

Yang Lianshuang explained, “Because you’ve been in contact with the god race. As far as they are concerned, you’re with the god race. Coupled with the amount of treasures you possess, and now that the god race has gone into hiding, who else would they target but you? It’s best if you don’t return right now.”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Why?”

She replied, “Because too many people are looking for you. They lost that many Sages, so they have to vent. Since they can’t find the god race to vent on them, they can only choose you!”

Yang Ye was stunned speechless.
