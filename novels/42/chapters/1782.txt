Chapter 1783 – The Shaman Race!

Yang Ye followed Yun Qian to a practice ground.

There was a huge arena at the center of the area. At this moment, many youths were sparring and having discussions there.

The gazes of everyone here moved over to Yang Ye and Yun Qian when they arrived.

Or to be more precise, their gazes had moved over to Yun Qian.

Yang Ye noticed that many of them had undisguised affection in their eyes.

Yang Ye glanced at Yun Qian. Needless to say, she was really beautiful, and she seemed proud and cold. So, it made many men feel like conquering her!

Suddenly, Yun Qian grabbed Yang Ye’s arm.

At this moment, everyone gazed at Yang Ye.

Yang Ye gazed at Yun Qian, and she grinned, “Lend me a hand!”

A shield!

At this moment, how could Yang Ye not realize that she’d brought him here because she wanted him to be her shield!

Yang Ye was quite displeased by this. Because he didn’t like trouble. If she was his, then it would definitely not be troublesome for him. But the problem was that she didn’t belong to him!

Yang Ye was about to speak when a figure suddenly shot over from afar. That figure shot over towards Yang Ye while emanating powerful waves of energy, and then a huge fist slammed down at Yang Ye’s head.

It was extremely powerful to the point the space around Yang Ye cracked open.

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly, and then he swung his fist too.

Bang!

An explosion resounded, and the figure was blasted over 30m back.

Yang Ye glanced over. There was a black robed man standing not too far away from Yang Ye. The man was around the age of 25, and he emanated a violent aura.

At this moment, everyone else had come over, and the gazes of many were on Yang Ye. There was a trace of surprise in their eyes.

“Who’s that fellow? He was actually able to use his physical strength to push Man Yu back!”

“I don’t know, but he seems to be close to Senior Sister Yun Qian….”

Yang Ye glanced at the man, and then he glanced at Yun Qian. In the end, he wanted to explain. Even though he didn’t fear the man before him, it really wasn’t necessary to be swept into this nonsense.

However, the man, Man Yu, suddenly pointed a finger at him before he could even speak, “Yun Qian, while I’m not worthy of you, he’s even less worthy.”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

Yun Qian shook her head slightly, “Man Yu, this is my business.”

Man Yu ignored Yun Qian and gazed at Yang Ye, “I don’t care who you are, but leave her. Otherwise, you may not be able to see the sunrise one day.”

Yang Ye’s face fell. He didn’t waste his breath and just wrapped an arm around Yun Qian’s waist, and then he looked Man Yu in the eyes, “Bite me!”

Clamorous noise resounded through the surroundings while all of them gazed at Yang Ye.

Yun Qian gazed at Yang Ye as well. At this moment, she recalled the scene outside Sword Immortal City. Yang Ye had slaughtered thousands in those few days!

Ferocity instantly covered Man Yu’s face when he heard Yang Ye, “Then I’ll stop you from seeing the moonlight tonight!”

As soon as he finished speaking, a long saber appeared in his grasp, and then he slammed his right foot down and transformed into a ray of light that shot at Yang Ye.

Right when the saber energy was just 10cm away from Yang Ye’s head, it suddenly stopped because two fingers had clamped down on it!

At this moment, the expressions of all the spectators had changed!

Even Man Yu’s expression had changed!

Yang Ye looked Man Yu in the eyes, “You’ll stop me from seeing tonight’s moonlight?” Yang Ye suddenly released the saber, and then he grabbed Man Yu’s throat before the latter could even react.

After that, Yang Ye slammed Man Yu against the ground.

Boom!

The ground cracked open. Man Yu’s head was buried in the ground and blood sprayed towards the surroundings!

Yang Ye looked down at Man Yu in silence, and then he kicked the latter’s stomach.

Bang!

Man Yu was kicked over 3km away.

Suddenly, a man in embroidered robes appeared not too far away from Yang Ye. The man glanced at Yang Ye and said, “Is that a little too much?”

“Too much?” A smile curled up on the corners of Yang Ye’s mouth, “He didn’t hold back at all just now. He really wanted to kill me. To be honest, I’ve been really merciful by sparing his life!”

The man gazed at Yang Ye for a long time and said, “I can’t stand the sight of you!”

Yang Ye looked the man in the eyes and replied, “Too many people feel like that. So, who the hell do you think you are?”

The man in embroidered robes nodded slightly, and then a black spear appeared in his grasp. As soon as he held the spear, his aura instantly became sharp and fierce. It seemed like he intended to pierce through the world!

The man didn’t attack and gazed at Yun Qian instead, “You won’t be angry if I kill him, right?”

Yun Qian glanced at the man and spoke softly, “Su Yu, it’s best if you don’t attack him.”

The man called Su Yu chuckled, “Why? You think I can’t kill him?”

Yun Qian nodded.

“Just watch me!” As soon as he finished speaking, Su Yu vanished on the spot, and he was in front of Yang Ye when he appeared again. At the same time, his spear stabbed forward in Yang Ye’s direction and space cracked apart in its wake!

Yang Ye’s gaze turned icy cold. While he was a cold-blooded person, he didn’t kill at random. At the very least, he wouldn’t look for trouble with people who didn’t offend him. Yet now, these two fellows wanted to kill him because they thought he was with Yun Qian!

The strong act willfully, and the weak are resigned to their fate!

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts, and then a sword appeared in his grasp. A moment later, everything froze here.

Su Yu’s spear stopped just a few inches away from Yang Ye’s forehead. It just stopped there. It only had to move forward a little and it would pierce Yang Ye’s head.

As for the reason it stopped, it was because a sword was pressed against the body of the spear.

Hiss!

A moment of silence ensued, and then the sword suddenly sliced through the spear.

Su Yu’s expression changed drastically, and he hurriedly released the spear before flashed 300m back. However, his right arm didn’t go with him!

A bloody arm fell down slowly from midair and dropped to the ground. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

At this moment, the expressions of everyone here had changed.

Everyone here gazed at Yang Ye!

Who is he?!

That was the question in all their minds.

Meanwhile, Su Yu looked up at Yang Ye, “Who….”

He hadn’t even finished speaking when a sword pressed against his forehead, and then Su Yu’s body stiffened on the spot.

“Brother Yang!” Meanwhile, Yun Qian suddenly spoke softly, “Killing isn’t necessary!”

Yang Ye glanced at her and smiled, “Of course I won’t kill!” He withdrew his sword once he finished speaking, and then he looked Su Yu in the eyes, “If you don’t have strength, then keep a low profile!”

Su Yu gazed at Yang Ye in silence.

Suddenly, a black robed old man appeared in front of Yang Ye. The old man said, “Young Master Yang, the Sect Master would like to see you. This isn’t a place to talk, so come with me?”

Yang Ye nodded, “Alright!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye gazed at Yun Qian, “Excuse me!”

He vanished on the spot with the black robed old man.

Su Yu gazed at Yun Qian and asked, “Who is he?”

Yun Qian spoke softly, “A very crazy person….”

…

A hall.

Only Yang Ye, Su Mu, and the black robed old man were in it.

Su Mu said, “Brother Yang, let’s head to where the head is sealed!”

Yang Ye asked, “Weren’t we supposed to go there in three days?”

Su Mu shook his head slightly, “Due to certain reasons, we have no choice but to bring it forward. It’s not a problem, right?”

Yang Ye glanced at him and said, “Of course!”

Su Mu nodded slightly, “Then let’s go!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he waved his right hand and vanished on the spot with Yang Ye.

It didn’t take long for them to arrive before a huge mountain. The mountain seemed very strange because it was covered in blood red symbols and chains. The chains were thick like pillars and were extremely numerous.

Yang Ye asked, “The head is in there?”

Su Mu nodded, “It’s at the heart of the mountain! Come!”

Su Mu walked towards the entrance.

Yang Ye glanced at Su Mu and followed him.

It didn’t take long for them to enter the mountain. Yang Ye noticed that the heart of the mountain was similarly filled with strange blood red symbols.

It was a formation!

Moreover, it was an extremely powerful formation!

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings, and he became vigilant. Meanwhile, Qiong Qi’s voice suddenly resounded in Yang Ye’s mind, “This place isn’t ordinary. Be careful.”

Yang Ye asked, “What is it?”

Qiong Qi spoke in a low voice, “I sense the evil aura of the Shaman Race!”

“The Shaman Race?” Yang Ye asked, “What’s that?”

Qiong Qi replied, “An extremely formidable race.” He paused for a moment and continued, “The owner of that Wargod’s arm you possess was from the Shaman Race!”

Yang Ye was speechless.

Suddenly, Su Mu stopped, and then he vanished on the spot. At the instant he vanished, the blood red symbols in the surroundings suddenly lit up, and then numerous waves of invisible energy appeared around Yang Ye.

“Kid, you can’t escape now!” Meanwhile, Qiong Qi spoke solemnly.

“Haha! I’m satisfied! This body isn’t bad, it really isn’t bad! Hahaha!” Suddenly, mad laughter resounded from deep within the mountain, and then the entire mountain started to tremble violently.
