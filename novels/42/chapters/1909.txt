Chapter 1910 – Don’t Waste Your Breath If You Can Use Your Fist!

Gu Suyan’s face instantly became gloomy.

A humiliation!

For the first time, he’d been humiliated before countless people.

Gu Suyan took a step forward, and he was very close to Yang Ye now. He looked Yang Ye in the eyes and said, “Go on! I didn’t hear you clearly just now! Say it one more time!”

Nansi Yin was about to say something when Yang Ye suddenly gazed at her, and he said, “Remember this. Don’t waste your breath if you can use your fist!”

It was Yang Ye’s style!

As soon as he finished speaking, he suddenly drew his sword!

Gu Suyan’s expression immediately changed at the same time.

Danger!

At this moment, he felt a chill run down his spine.

He’d underestimated his enemy! He’d absolutely underestimated Yang Ye!

Fortunately, he was no ordinary expert, and his reaction wasn’t slow at all. As soon as Yang Ye’s sword was swung towards him, he’d crossed his arms above him.

Golden armor appeared on his shoulder.

Bang!

Gu Suyan’s figure was blasted over 10km away. As soon as he stopped himself, blood seeped out from the corner of his mouth. At the same time, his shoulderguards cracked apart and fell.

Everyone gazed at Yang Ye with shock in their eyes. Of course, there was even more fear in their eyes!Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

At this moment, Bei Cangyue and the others were looking at Yang Ye too. Except Bei Cangyue who had a calm expression on her face, all the others’ eyes were filled with fear.

After blasting Gu Suyan back, Yang Ye started walking slowly in Gu Suyan’s direction.

Gu Suyan took the spear hanging on his back and spoke solemnly, “Who are you?!” He was no fool. It was obvious that someone capable of pushing him back with a single attack was absolutely not ordinary!

Yang Ye stopped. He ignored Gu Suyan and gazed at Bei Cangyue instead. A moment of silence ensued, and then he suddenly cracked a smile and started walking towards Bei Cangyue.

Bei Cangyue slowly clenched her fists at the sight of this. As for the others by her side, they seemed like they were facing a formidable enemy, and they were fully vigilant.

Being ignored by Yang Ye made Gu Suyan’s face become even more unsightly. Especially when it happened while Bei Cangyue was watching!

He remained silent for a moment, and then he stomped his right foot down and transformed into a ray of white light that shot towards Yang Ye. When he arrived around 10km away from Yang Ye, he stabbed his spear at Yang Ye.

Yang Ye stopped, and then a ray of light flashed beneath his feet before he vanished on the spot. He was in front of Gu Suyan when he appeared again, and his sword stabbed forward!

Yang Ye and Gu Suyan’s attacks collided head-on in the most direct manner.

Bang!

The space in a huge area trembled violently, and then Gu Suyan’s figure was blasted away.

Once he was blasted away, Yang Ye didn’t attack again, and Yang Ye just walked slowly in Bei Cangyue’s direction.

However, a vicious glow flashed through Gu Suyan’s eyes, and then he grabbed his spear with both hands and hurled it at Yang Ye.

The spear tore through the sky, and the space before it cracked apart.

Yang Ye stopped again. He turned around and swung his sword.

Bang!

It blasted the spear away. A moment later, Yang Ye vanished on the spot, and he was in front of Gu Suyan when he appeared once more. After that, ten ethereal swords appeared around Gu Suyan.

An instant later, Gu Suyan was drowned beneath them.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye vanished and entered the area covered by sword energy.

“AH!” Suddenly, a shrill and miserable cry resounded, and then the sword energy vanished. After that, a man holding a bloody head walked out from there.

It was Yang Ye, of course. As for the head, it was Gu Suyan’s!

Dead!

Gu Suyan was dead!

Yang Ye glanced at the head, shook his head, and then tossed it aside. After that, he started walking in Bei Cangyue’s direction.

Nansi Yin’s eyelids twitched, and she hesitated to say something. She wanted to stop Yang Ye because Bei Cangyue wasn’t someone who could just be killed like that. Killing her would definitely cause a huge amount of trouble, but she knew that Yang Ye definitely didn’t care!

Yang Ye dared to kill the members of the Shaman Hunter Clan and even her, but no matter how outstanding Bei Cangyue’s identity was, it couldn’t compare to her or the Shaman Hunter Clan!

Yang Ye stopped. At this moment, he was less than 30m away from Bei Cangyue.

All the others around Bei Cangyue were extremely vigilant!

Yang Ye gazed at her and then smiled, “I heard about your father. How should I put it… Your father is extraordinary indeed, but I didn’t expect his daughter to be such trash like you!”

Bei Cangyue’s expression changed, but Yang Ye continued, “Your father relied on his own strength to gain his current accomplishments, but what about you? Playing tricks like this? Don’t you think you’re dragging your father’s name into the dirt?”

Bei Cangyue gazed at Yang Ye for a long time and cracked a smile. She was about to say something when Yang Ye suddenly appeared before her, and then a sword pressed against her forehead.

It had happened out of nowhere!

Bei Cangyue hadn’t been able to react because she’d been too close to Yang Ye, and Yang Ye had utilized the Sword Domain and Split Second.

She couldn’t defend herself against it at all!

Yang Ye held his sword against her forehead and said, “See? I can kill you at any time!”

Bei Cangyue spoke in a low voice, “I really underestimated you!”

Yang Ye said, “I hate people who play tricks like these. But you’ve been doing it over and over again. To be honest, I’m really losing my patience.

As soon as he finished speaking, his sword stabbed in a little.

Blood instantly seeped out and covered Bei Cangyue’s face!

“Young Brother, please show mercy!” Meanwhile, an aged voice resounded, and then an old man appeared not too far behind Bei Cangyue.

Yang Ye gazed at the old man, “I thought you weren’t going to show yourself!”

The old man sized up Yang Ye and smiled, “So you noticed my presence. Extraordinary, extraordinary indeed! Young Brother, Cangyue is young and insensible. I hope you don’t take her offense to heart. I apologize on her behalf!”

He flicked a spatial ring to Yang Ye, “I hope you’ll accept my goodwill!”

Yang Ye scanned the spatial ring. There were 50 immortal crystals in it!

Yang Ye smiled and gazed at the old man, “Actually, I thought you would threaten me to let her go!”

If the old man had done that, it was obvious that Bei Cangyue would have lost her head!

The old man shook his head, “She made a mistake, so how can I disregard right and wrong?”

Yang Ye glanced at the old man, and then he gazed at Bei Cangyue, “Don’t let conceit cloud your judgment. Understand?”

Bei Cangyue looked Yang Ye in the eyes, “I do!”

Yang Ye grinned, and then he put the spatial ring away and walked over to Nansi Yin, “Let’s go!”

He walked off into the distance once he finished speaking.

Nansi Ying lanced at Bei Cangyue and smiled, “Miss Cangyue, see you next time…”

She quickly followed after Yang Ye.

Bei Cangyue stared at their vanishing figures and asked, “Uncle Li, why didn’t you fight him? Even you aren’t confident in being able to defeat him?”

The old man shook his head, “Little girl, you’re still too young.”

Bei Cangyue gazed at the old man, “What?”

The old man replied, “Do you think he’s ordinary?”

Bei Cangyue fell silent.

The old man continued, “How proud is the Nansi Clan? However, they actually allowed their eldest young miss to follow him. Moreover, haven’t you noticed? Nansi Yin doesn’t make the decision, and she obeys everything he says!”

Bei Cangyue remained silent.

The old man continued, “He dared to kill members of the Shaman Hunter Clan and attack you. Do you think someone ordinary would dare to do that?”

Bei Cangyue asked, “We aren’t able to determine his background?”

The old man shook his head, “We found nothing. The only thing we found is that he went to the Floating Sect, and then he passed through the Floating Path within 10 breaths of time!”

“10 breaths of time!” Bei Cangyue gazed at the old man, “Are you certain?”

The old man nodded, “The Floating Sect’s master admitted it himself, so it’s definitely true. That man is not ordinary at all.”

He gazed at Bei Cangyue at this point, “It’s normal for the young to seek to excel over others, but you must know your limits, and you must not make the same mistake twice. There’s no enmity between us, but do you know that if you keep going against him, then if you kill him or he kills you, the forces behind him will show themselves, and then Northern Sky City will have another formidable enemy!”

Bei Cangyue took a deep breath and nodded, “I was wrong. Don’t worry, Uncle Li. I won’t offend him again!”

A gratified expression flashed through his eyes, “It’s good that you can think that way. Of course, our Northern Sky City isn’t an existence that just anyone can bully. If he bullies you, then there’s no need to make any compromises. Northern Sky City will always stand by you!”

Bei Cangyue nodded, “I understand!”

The old man said, “Go on in. You won’t get anything if you’re too late. Right, be careful of those fellows hiding in the shadows. Especially the shaman race’s Li Wu. She’s here, and you must be wary of her.”

A wisp of surprise flashed through Bei Cangyue’s eyes, “She’s here too?”

The old man nodded, “She isn’t the only one. Bai Lixian from the human race and Wan Kongyan from the devil race are here too. So, be careful! Besides them, there are a few others hiding in the shadows. In short, just be careful. Remember that your life is the most important thing!”

Bei Cangyue looked into the distance, “It’s going to be a very intense battle!”

…

As they traveled, Nansi Yin suddenly asked Yang Ye, “Why didn’t you kill her?”

Yang Ye stopped and gazed at her, “If I kill her, that old man will try to kill me, the Northern Sky Cavalry will try to kill me, and her father will try to kill me. Just thinking about it gives me a headache!”

Nansi Yin was stunned speechless.
