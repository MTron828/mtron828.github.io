Chapter 1513 - Actually, I’m An Extraordinary Genius Too!

Translator: InVader

Yang Ye was stunned indeed

He hadn’t expected the young man to just attack him. Moreover, the young man seemed like there was deep-rooted enmity between them! He swore that he’d never been to True Martial Stellar Region!

Moreover, the young man knew his name yet still dared to attack him… That was very unusual. He wasn’t being narcissistic, but while there were existences in the lower dimensions who dared to fight him, there were very few. Moreover, those existences absolutely didn’t include this young man.

Yang Ye was puzzled!

Meanwhile, the young man’s fist had arrived in front of him.

Yang Ye clenched his right fist and slammed it forward!

Boom!

Space trembled as the young man was instantly blasted around 3k away!

The young gazed at his numb arm and was stunned. He looked up at Yang Ye and said, “As expected of the person that Senior Sister An has in her mind. But I was just careless earlier and didn’t take you seriously, and that’s why I suffered that small loss. Now, you won’t have such an opportunity anymore.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he unfurled his left palm, pulled it back slightly, and then pushed it forward slightly. An energy palm emerged from it, and then the space around him started trembling violently. The space here seemed incapable of enduring the energy within it. The young man shouted with fury, and the energy palm slammed down at Yang Ye!

When the energy palm arrived 3m away from Yang Ye, it suddenly shook, and then it transformed into countless energy palms that enveloped Yang Ye!

A smile curled up on the corners of the young man’s mouth when he witnessed this scene. He was about to speak when the energy palms suddenly shattered! After that, Yang Ye appeared in front of him.

The young man was shocked and instinctively slammed his fist forward.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye slammed his first forward as well!

Boom!

The young man was blasted 3km away again. This time, Yang Ye had clearly not held back much, so the young man’s entire arm was twisted. Moreover, he spat out over a dozen mouthfuls of blood as his figure flew backwards.

The young man gazed at Yang Ye while a trace of shock filled his eyes, “You… you’re actually so strong…”

Yang Ye replied with a question, “You didn’t know I was strong?”

The young man glanced at Yang Ye and said, “I didn’t know in the past, but I know now.”

“You didn’t know before this?” Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed, “Have you not heard of me?”

“I have!” The young man continued, “According to Senior Sister An, you’re her fiancé…”

Her fiancé!

Yang Ye was stunned, “She said that?”

The young man nodded.

As he spoke with the young man, it didn’t take long for Yang Ye to finally understand why An Nanjing had said that. An Nanjing was extremely popular in the Martial Sect, and a huge number of people were pursuing her. An Nanjing was naturally not interested in them, but they were from the same sect. So, she couldn’t stop them from pursuing them by beating them up, right?

After all, very few people tried to play dirty tricks. Moreover, because of her unique physique, the higher-ups of the Martial Sect treated her like their treasure. So, others could pursue her openly, but if anyone dared to play tricks, then they would definitely die!

Thus, An Nanjing had used Yang Ye as a form of defense in the end. In that way, the men of the Martial Sect had a single person in their mind, and it was Yang Ye.

That was also why the young man had attacked upon finding out that he was Yang Ye. As for why the young man had dared to attack him, it was because Yang Ye’s deeds in the Eastern Territory and Southern Territory hadn’t spread here yet. The Western Territory was comparatively proud, so it very rarely maintained contact with the other territories. Coupled with the fact that it was very far from the Eastern Territory, many people here weren’t aware of Yang Ye’s true strength!

Meanwhile, the young man said, “Come! I’ll take you to the Sect Master!”

Yang Ye asked, “You’re not going to kill me anymore?”

The young man laughed bitterly, “I was just thinking what right you have to get Senior Sister An. The facts prove that you have every right.” He didn’t know what Yang Ye’s true strength was like, but based on the collision they just had, he knew that even 10 experts like him couldn’t be a match for Yang Ye. If he were to insist on fighting Yang Ye now, then he would be courting death!

Yang Ye nodded, “Come, take me to your sect master!”

The young man nodded. Just like that, Yang Ye arrived at Divine Valiance City under the young man’s lead.

Divine Valiance City.

The young man spoke abruptly when they were about to enter the city, “You… you should be careful.”

Yang Ye gazed at him, “Why? Is there danger in the city?”

The young man smiled with embarrassment, “There might be!”

Yang Ye seemed to have thought of something and nodded, “Indeed.”

It didn’t take long for the young man to lead Yang Ye to Divine Valiance Hall, and then the young man went in to report Yang Ye’s arrival. Because the people here didn’t know about Yang Ye’s identity and strength, they merely treated him as An Nanjing’s friend and not the leader of a stellar region. Otherwise, they wouldn’t treat him like this. After all, Yang Ye was the leader of a stellar region, and he was here to pay the Martial Sect a visit, so they should send someone of sufficient status to entertain him.

However, Yang Ye didn’t mind. He’d never cared about things like this.

The Martial Sect was An Nanjing’s sect, and this sect had helped An Nanjing. So, he naturally wouldn’t do things that would put An Nanjing in a difficult situation.

Around 15 minutes later, a group of young men suddenly walked out of the hall. There were over 100 of them. At the same time, many others rushed over to Yang Ye from the surroundings. In just a short while, there were over 1,000 people below the stairs towards the hall, and there were even more coming from all directions!

“That fellow is Yang Ye? He doesn’t look that great. He isn’t as handsome as me. So why does Senior Sister An like that fellow?”

“Exactly. It’s like a flower being stuck on a pile of sh*t!”

“I think that he has hid his strength well. After all, Senior Sister An is a proud person. If she likes him, then how could he possibly be just a pile of sh*t?”

“We’ll know whether he’s a pile of sh*t in a moment!”

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings. He naturally heard what they were saying. Because they didn’t seem to be worried about him hearing, or perhaps it could be said that they were letting him hear them on purpose. He was quite surprised. He was surprised by how popular An Nanjing was here. Actually, An Nanjing wasn’t a gorgeous woman, but she possessed a unique aura, and that aura was extremely attractive.

She constantly strived to grow stronger!

Since Profounder Continent, she was the one and only person who could keep up with him and maybe even surpass him.

People like Nether Maiden couldn’t be taken into consideration. Because she started cultivating again after reincarnating herself, but An Nanjing wasn’t. An Nanjing had relied on herself to cultivate all the way. Besides her own natural talent, her current accomplishments couldn’t do without her hard work. Actually, as far as Yang Ye was concerned, hard work was always more important than natural talent!

If someone with inferior natural talent worked hard, that person would attain success one day. However, if those with good natural talent didn’t work hard, then even the best natural talent would be wasted. But if someone had good natural talent and worked hard, then that person would be terrifying. An Nanjing was such a person!

Meanwhile, a man in an embroidered robe who stood at the front of the group which came from within the hall asked, “You’re Yang Ye?”

Yang Ye gazed at the man and nodded, “I am!”

The man in an embroidered robe walked over to Yang Ye and looked him in the eyes, “I’ll be frank. Junior Sister An is an extraordinary genius, and you’re not worthy of her at all. So, stay away from her. Understand?”

Yang Ye touched his nose and said, “Actually, I’m an extraordinary genius too!”

“You?” The man sized up Yang Ye and said, “I don’t see it!”

Yang Ye glanced at the man and said, “Why don’t you give it a try?”

Clamorous noise instantly resounded through the surroundings!

Obviously, they hadn’t expected Yang Ye to dare to publicly challenge a disciple of the Martial Sect in the Martial Sect. After all, it was the Martial Sect’s territory!

The man gazed at Yang Ye for a long time and nodded, “Then let’s try!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he slammed his fist forward!

Crack!

The space around Yang Ye cracked apart. At the same time, the space in a huge area started to ripple like boiling water, and it was an extremely shocking sight.

Yang Ye slammed his fist forward as well.

Their fists collided in the most direct manner.

Boom!

An explosion resounded, and then everyone watched with shock as the man was blasted into the hall. Moreover, all the others standing behind the man were blasted away as well.

At this moment, everyone here was stunned!

Because they hadn’t expected the man to be defeated from just a single collision. All of them gazed at Yang Ye, and besides shock, there was a trace of curiosity in their eyes.

In the hall, the man was supporting himself on one knee, and his right arm was trembling violently. Even though it was trembling, he couldn’t feel it. Because he couldn’t feel that arm anymore. Actually, it wasn’t just his arm, he was almost unable to feel his entire body.

The man looked up at Yang Ye, “How strong!”

As soon as he finished speaking, a strand of blood seeped out from the corner of his mouth. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Yang Ye shrugged helplessly when he saw the man bleed, “I held back.”

Pu!

The young man spat out another mouthful of blood when he heard Yang Ye.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings, “I heard the Martial Sect is fond of battle. I, Yang Ye, feel that I’m lacking, so I would like to seek guidance from the geniuses of the Martial Sect.”

Yang Ye paused for a moment at this point, and then he said, “Out of consideration for my strength, I suggest that all of you join forces.”
