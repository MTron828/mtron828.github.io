Chapter 2465 – Fuck!

Kill!

Huang Ying shook his head and smiled. He hadn’t known Yang Ye for long, but he knew Yang Ye’s temper very well.

Absolutely vengeful!

Yang Ye was an absolutely petty person, and one could only dream that he would be magnanimous upon offending him!

Huang Ying turned around with the intent to leave, but a voice came from within the city, “Crown Prince, please come in!”

It was Di Lian’s voice!

Huang Ying didn’t hesitate to enter the city.

At this moment, the city was in a mess.

Huang Ying and Di Lian walked side by side through the streets.

Huang Ying spoke first, “Senior, did you want to ask about his background?”

Di Lian nodded, “My Di Clan suffered such a huge loss today, so I should at least know why, right?”

Huang Ying smiled, ‘Actually, even I don’t really know what it is. The reason my desolate race gave up on the Sprite Progenitor was naturally not me. However, even I don’t know the real reason. This is the truth!”

He paused for a moment and continued, “Actually, you should feel relieved. He possesses such strength at such a young age, so becoming enemies with him is a very unwise choice. Don’t you think so too?”

Di Lian fell silent for a moment and replied, “My Di Clan failed to give this proper consideration!”

The Di Clan had thought that while Yang Ye’s strength wasn’t bad, it wasn’t great either. But they were wrong, it wasn’t just not bad, he was very strong!

Huang Ying nodded slightly, “It’s not too late!”

Di Lian suddenly said, “I heard the Eternal Kingdom captured his father-in-law and even issued the highest warrant for him!”

Huang Ying glanced at Di Lian, “You're quite well-informed!”

Di Lian replied indifferently, “The Eternal Kingdom isn’t as easy to convince as my Di Clan!”

Huang Ying smiled, “That’s true.”

He stopped and continued, “I have many other things to deal with back home, so I’ll be taking my leave!”

Di Lian said, “Eternal Kingdom isn’t the same now! They’ve been waiting for this day since a very long time ago!”

Huang Ying smiled, “My desolate race isn’t the same either!”

He chuckled and left.

Di Lian closed his eyes slowly. Regardless of whether it was the desolate race or Eternal Kingdom, they were stronger than the Di Clan!

Which side should the Di Clan take?

Anyone who took the wrong side throughout history had been destroyed!

…

Once he left the Emperor World, he quickly contacted Nanli Meng, and she immediately gave him an answer without wasting her breath trying to persuade him!

Yang Ye put the transmission talisman away and vanished on the spot.

Eternal River.

At this moment, a group was dashing madly above the river!

They were the experts of the Creation Sect and Immortality Sect!

They were rushing toward Eternal Kingdom!

After they were driven out by the Di Clan, Zhao Wuji and the others knew very well that the Eternal Kingdom was their only hope! If they couldn’t make Eternal Kingdom take them in, they would be finished!

Yang Ye’s strength was so great that even the Di Clan had to make a compromise!

Flee!

As far as they were concerned, they could only flee like madmen to Eternal Kingdom!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye shot through space on his sword.

Suddenly, he stopped and entered the Primordial Pagoda!

On the Ascension Platform.

Yang Ye went to the platform, and he saw the demons seated in a circle. At the center of them was a huge pot, and it was so huge that it was the largest he’d ever seen!

There were chunks of meat in the pot!

Erya was still commanding the others, “Oxxy, cut the remaining meat into smaller pieces. Tiger, put more oil in, and those seasonings. Dragon, you go ask Big Sister An and the others if they want some dragon!”

The dragon was speechless.

Meanwhile, Erya saw Yang Ye. Her eyes lit up and waved at him, “Oh, Big Brother Yang, your mind is clear again!”

Yang Ye was stunned speechless.

Erya walked over to Yang Ye and pulled him over to the pot, “Big Brother Yang, it’s dragon meat in there. It’s very delicious. Want to try some?”

Yang Ye glanced at it and asked, “The black dragon?”

Erya nodded, “Actually, that little dragon would definitely be more delicious than this black dragon, but it can’t be helped, I can’t kill it, right? Fortunately, this black dragon barely passes, so I’ll just make do!”

Yang Ye couldn’t help but glance at her. Only Erya was capable of making dragon stew! Now, Yang Ye finally understood why Butcher considered her a little demon!

Meanwhile, Snowy went over to Yang Ye, and there was a pearl in her paw!

The Dragon Pearl!

Erya said, “Big Brother Yang, that’s a great treasure. Your strength will improve quite a bit once you eat it!”

A Dragon Pearl!

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment, took it, and glanced at Erya and Snowy, “Have fun. I have things to attend to!”

Yang Ye left the pagoda!

Erya muttered softly, “He’s definitely going to kill again!”

Snowy was at a loss for words.

Erya pulled Snowy over to the pot. At this moment, the soul in it was boiling.

Oxxy and the others were staring at the pot.

They were even on the verge of drooling!

Actually, cooked or raw meat made no difference to them. However, Erya had been raised by humans, so she preferred cooked meat! It couldn’t be helped, they had to let her have what she wanted! Moreover, Snowy didn’t like raw meat either. She would just refuse if it was raw, but she would try it if it was cooked!

Outside the Primordial Pagoda.

Yang Ye sped up, and it didn’t take long for him to arrive at the Eternal River. Yang Ye gazed at the boundless river before him, and he didn’t hesitate to fly over it on his sword.

The Eternal River was divided into three parts, downstream, midstream, and upstream. Upstream was the end of the river, and it was called its bank. The Universe Wall was right after it, and Eternal Kingdom was right beyond the wall!

Yang Ye quickly passed through the downstream area. There was no danger there, but he encountered trouble upon arriving at the midstream area!

He encountered a colossal demon beast!

An aquatic demon beast!

It was quite familiar because he’d seen one just like this, a Royal Crocodile! It looked almost identical to the Royal Crocodile from before. However, it was pure black, and it was many times larger than the one he’d seen in the past! Besides that, it had a row of spikes on its back. These spikes were extremely long and there were hundreds of them!

“A Primal Royal Crocodile!” Sword Scroll’s voice resounded in Yang Ye’s mind, “This is a pure-blooded Primal Royal Crocodile, an aquatic overlord. Even the Primal True Dragon wouldn’t dare to rashly fight it underwater. Their combat strength is greatly increased while underwater!”

A Primal Royal Crocodile!

Yang Ye glanced at the Primal Royal Crocodile that was looking at him. He thought for a moment and said, “Let me pass!”

The crocodile suddenly opened its mouth and roared.

Bang!

A pillar of water surged at Yang Ye!

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly, and he swung his sword.

Hiss!

It instantly sliced apart the pillar of water. But a colossus suddenly slammed itself at him!

It was the Primal Royal Crocodile!

Yang Ye frowned slightly and swung his sword!

Bang!

Yang Ye was blasted away by it! And he flew over 3km back!

However, there was a huge bloody injury on the crocodile’s head!

The crocodile was furious from being injured by Yang Ye!

It raised its head and roared, and then it charged at Yang Ye again! The water in the area rippled, and then waves surged at Yang Ye! These waves simply blotted out the sky!

They were like a tsunami!

Yang Ye’s gaze gradually turned icy cold. He was about to attack when Erya appeared before him. She glanced at Yang Ye and said, “Big Brother Yang, take a rest. Leave this fellow to me!”

She immediately charged at the crocodile once she finished speaking!

Yang Ye was stunned speechless.

Bang!Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

An explosion resounded, and then countless waves exploded apart and rained down like a storm!

Yang Ye looked over and saw Erya’s fist slam against the crocodile’s head, causing it to be blasted away! However, Erya didn’t stop. She leaped up and slammed her figure against it!

The crocodile’s eyes were filled with viciousness. It had been utterly infuriated!

Roar!

The crocodile roared, and then it slammed its body at Erya!

It had chosen a head-on collision!

Yang Ye couldn’t help but close his eyes! He felt the crocodile was insane!

Just like that, they slammed against each other.

Boom!

The river water in the surroundings surged up into the clouds! As for the crocodile, it howled with pain as it flew away!

This time, its head had cracked open, and the flesh within was clearly visible. Moreover, its entire body was covered in cracks!

Blood was spraying in all directions!

Everywhere it passed, it dyed the river water blood red!

Erya patted her own head. She felt a little dizzy because she’d hit it a little too hard just now!

It didn’t take long for her to shake her head and look at the crocodile. She was about to attack again when Snowy appeared in front of her. Snowy pointed at the crocodile and pointed at herself!

Erya blinked, “Snowy, I think we shouldn’t try to make it submit. We should kill it and eat it, that’s our real style!”

Snowy blinked and hurriedly shook her head. She pointed at the crocodile to display that they could recruit it to fight for them!

Erya felt quite helpless, “But I want to eat it!”

Snowy passed a tanghulu to her. Snowy was telling her to eat tanghulu instead!

Erya patted Snowy’s head, “Snowy, tanghulu isn’t as tasty as meat! Moreover, as a demon, it’s definitely very unyielding. Trust me, it won’t surrender, and it won’t submit to you!”

Suddenly, the Primal Royal Crocodile spoke, “I’m willing to surrender! I-I’m willing to submit!”

Erya was stunned, and then she gazed at it, “Fuck…”
