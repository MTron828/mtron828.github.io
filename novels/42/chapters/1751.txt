Chapter 1752 – An Ancient Aura!

Speed!

It was caused by absolute speed!

Suddenly, a sword howl resounded, and then the space in an area of over 1km around Yang Ye and Yang Lianshuang was sliced apart. Besides space, Yang Xiang’s afterimages were sliced apart too!

The Obliteration Sword Formation!

At the moment Yang Xiang attacked, Yang Ye knew that he couldn’t hold back anymore! If he did, he might really die!

So, he’d used the Obliteration Sword Formation!

At the instant that space and Yang Xiang’s afterimages were sliced into countless pieces…Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Boom!

A loud explosion resounded, and then space in an area of over 1km collapsed. At this moment, a huge black hole appeared in space!

Boom!

After that, another explosion resounded within the pitch black hole, and then two figures were tossed out of it.

They were Yang Ye and Yang Lianshuang of course!

The expressions of the experts from the Yang Clan turned gloomy at the sight of this. They naturally hoped that Yang Ye and Yang Lianshuang won. Because it represented that the Yang Clan would have a future. So long as Yang Ye and Yang Lianshuang were there, even if the Yang Clan didn’t have any 6th stage True Realm experts, they were certain that it wouldn’t take long for the Yang Clan to regain its glory!

Yang Ye and Yang Lianshuang’s natural talent and potential could accomplish that!

But if Yang Xiang won, even if the Yang Clan would be fine for now, it wouldn’t have any more experts left in the future. Moreover, they’d sided with Yang Ye and Yang Lianshuang. So, if Yang Xiang won, would he spare them?

Thus, they hoped Yang Ye and Yang Lianshuang won.

However, they weren’t able to see any hope of victory!

Yang Ye and Yang Lianshuang were being completely suppressed!

After they stopped themselves, Yang Ye looked down at his body. It was covered in cracks, and blood was ceaselessly seeping out of those cracks!

Yang Ye glanced at Yang Lianshuang. At this moment, blood was seeping out incessantly from the corner of her mouth. Obviously, she was heavily injured too.

Yang Ye flicked two Energy Pearls over to her. She didn’t say a word and just swallowed them.

Meanwhile, Yang Xiang suddenly appeared around 30m away from them. At this moment, he was in quite an embarrassing state when compared to how he was just moments ago. Besides numerous injuries caused by swords, there were two bloody claw prints on him as well!

Obviously, while he’d won the collision, he’d suffered some injuries!

Yang Ye and Yang Lianshuang heaved sighs of relief when they noticed that Yang Xiang had suffered some injuries.

Because it represented that Yang Xiang wasn’t invincible. He could still be injured, and so long as he could be injured, they had a chance!

Yang Xiang glanced at the injuries on his body, and then he looked up at Yang Ye and Yang Lianshuang, “Do you have any other moves?”

Yang Ye gazed at Yang Lianshuang, “Do you?”

She nodded slightly, “I do. However, I’ll pay quite a huge price if I use it. What about you?”

Yang Ye smiled, “I do as well. But just like you, I’ll have to pay quite a huge price if I use it!”

She said, “Shall we do it together?”

Yang Ye nodded, “Alright!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he suddenly placed his left hand on his right arm, and then he pulled. In an instant, his right sleeve was obliterated.

At this moment, there was nothing special about Yang Ye’s right arm. Suddenly, Yang Ye placed his left hand on the golden talisman stuck on his right arm, and he didn’t hesitate to pull it off.

As soon as the talisman was pulled off, Yang Ye’s right arm shook, and then a golden bracer appeared there. No, the golden bracer had been formed from his skin!

The Wargod’s arm!

At this point in the battle, Yang Ye had no other choice. Yang Xiang’s cultivation was too high, and Yang Xiang had cultivated countless years more than he had. If he didn’t use external sources of strength, he wouldn’t be a match for Yang Xiang at all.

Once the golden bracer appeared on Yang Ye’s right arm, it started to tremble violently, and then the space around him actually started to tremble as well. At the same time, Yang Ye’s expression started to change.

Yang Ye’s features started to warp, and it seemed like he was enduring enormous pain!

Strength!

At this moment, Yang Ye felt like his right arm was filled with boundless strength. However, that strength didn’t belong to him, and it was so strong that it surpassed the limits that his body could endure.

The most terrifying part was that he could sense that the strength in his right arm was still growing, and it felt like it had no limit!

Yang Ye knew that if this continued, then it would take an hour at most before his body would explode because of this strength!

Yang Xiang frowned at the sight of this. At this moment, he sensed danger, and this feeling of danger was actually coming from a Zenith Realm cultivator.

The disdain in his eyes grew lighter.

He looked down on Yang Ye and Yang Lianshuang, and he had the right to do so. But he was no fool. Yang Ye made him feel a sense of danger right now, so he would be courting death if he continued looking down on Yang Ye.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly grabbed the wooden sword with his right hand. But the wooden sword started to shake violently.

Rejection!

The wooden sword was rejecting his arm!

Yang Ye looked down at the wooden sword, “Work with me or we’re all going to die.”

As soon as he finished speaking, the wooden sword gradually calmed down.

Yang Ye took a deep breath and forcefully suppressed the discomfort he was feeling throughout his body, and then he looked up at Yang Xiang, “Come! Let’s try again!”

Yang Ye vanished on the spot.

Split Second!

Its speed was still the same, but the strength it carried was different!

An instant later, Yang Ye appeared in front of Yang Xiang. At the same time, the tip of his sword arrived three inches away from Yang Xiang’s forehead. However, it didn’t take long for his sword to stop because Yang Xiang had pinched Yang Ye’s sword.

However, at the instant he pinched Yang Ye’s sword, his expression changed drastically, and he immediately intended to release the sword. Unfortunately, it was too late.

Hiss!

Two fingers flew up into the air while Yang Xiang was blasted 3km away!

Everyone here was stunned by this scene.

Yang Ye has become that strong?

At this moment, they were absolutely astounded. After all, Yang Xiang was a 6th stage True Realm expert. Unlike Yang Xiao, he was amongst those people who were at the absolute top of this universe. Because no expert above the 6th stage of the True Realm existed in the medium universe of the Milky Way System.

There were such experts in the past, but not anymore!

But what about Yang Ye?

Yang Ye was just at the Zenith Realm. He was miles away from Yang Xiang’s cultivation, but he’d actually sliced off two of Yang Xiang’s fingers and pushed Yang Xiang 3km back with a single attack.

If they hadn’t witnessed it with their own eyes, they would absolutely not believe that a Zenith Realm expert had pushed back a 6th stage True Realm expert with just one attack.

At this moment, there was a wisp of shock in Yang Lianshuang’s eyes as well. Obviously, even she’d been shocked by the strength of Yang Ye’s attack. After revealing shock, ridicule appeared on her face. It wasn’t ridicule towards Yang Ye, it was ridicule towards Yang Xiao and the Yang Clan!

Yang Xiao was undoubtedly a fool. Because so long as the Yang Clan received the help of either Yang Ye or Yang Lianshuang, then the other one would be absolutely unable to succeed at rebelling. Unfortunately, the Yang Clan wasn’t able to accept both of them.

The leader of a clan couldn’t be selfish and should be able to accept others. Otherwise, it would be impossible for that clan to thrive.

Yang Xiang glanced at his fingers, and then he gazed at Yang Ye. At this moment, there was no disdain left in his eyes. Because if he hadn’t moved backwards swiftly just now and allowed Yang Ye’s attack to strike him, then even he didn’t dare to consider the consequences!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly started walking in Yang Xiang’s direction, “Don’t you know how to modify the world? Why don’t you do it now?”

Yang Xiang’s eyes narrowed slightly, and a cold glow flashed through them. After that, he stretched out his right hand and waved it lightly. In an instant, the space around Yang Ye started to move strangely.

Suddenly, Yang Ye raised his sword and swung it.

A ray of light flashed, and then the moving expanse of space around him was instantly obliterated.

Yang Xiang’s face fell at the sight of this.

Suddenly, Yang Ye vanished on the spot, and he was in front of Yang Xiang when he appeared again. After that, his sword slashed down in Yang Xiang’s direction.

There were no flashy moves, and it was just a simple slash!

However, there were at least 20 attacks overlapped in it!

Yang Xiang didn’t dare act carelessly. His profound energy surged, and then he stretched his hand forward and clenched it.

The space around him instantly warped into a vortex, but Yang Ye’s sword slashed straight into it.

Bang!

A loud explosion resounded, and then the space around them collapsed once more. This time, the collapsed space wasn’t repaired because Yang Ye and Yang Xiang were fighting within the black hole.

Both of them were too strong, and they were so strong that the Laws of the world couldn’t keep up with the rate they damaged the surrounding!

In the black hole, Yang Ye and Yang Xiang were locked in a fierce battle.

Meanwhile, outside the black hole. Yang Lianshuang suddenly closed her eyes.

A moment later, an extremely powerful aura swept out from within her.

Once this aura appeared, Qiong Qi’s expression changed, “An ancient aura… Impossible….”
