Chapter 838 – Trash! All Of You Are Trash!

Editor: Conspiracing

“I, Liu Sha, refuse to live a life of being restrained by the threats of another!” Liu Sha’s ferocious voice resounded as the dagger swept at Yang Ye. Yang Ye’s strength was formidable indeed, and it was especially so for his physical body. Because it was much stronger than many Monarch Realm demon beasts that Liu Sha had met in his lifetime. However, he suspected that Yang Ye was heavily injured, and he’d discerned this from 2 aspects.

Firstly, if Yang Ye wasn’t injured, then as an Exalt Realm expert, there would be no need for Yang Ye to travel by carriage. After all, he could just fly to his destination. But Yang Ye hadn’t!

Secondly, the disciples of the Dao Order were ruthless people, and they absolutely wouldn’t leave potential troubles behind when they did anything. Yang Ye could instantly annihilate ordinary Monarch Realm experts, but he hadn’t crushed the entire Ye Clan in Skywind City, and he’d chosen to flee instead!

So, Liu Sha was certain that Yang Ye was definitely heavily injured right now! As for the reason he attacked Yang Ye, it was very simple as well. He refused to believe that Yang Ye would spare him. Every single disciple of the Dao Order was a ruthless person, so he might die right away once Yang Ye recovered.

He, Liu Sha, was a decisive person. So, he attacked decisively once he thought all of this through.

Yang Ye didn’t dodge Liu Sha’s sudden attack. Of course, he had no intention of doing so, nor did he try to block the dagger. He smashed his fist towards Liu Sha’s stomach instead.

Clang!

Bang!

Liu Sha’s dagger struck Yang Ye’s throat while Yang Ye’s fist smashed against Liu Sha’s stomach. Yang Ye remained motionless on the spot while Liu Sha spat out a mouthful of blood instead, and then his figure curled up as it flew backwards. However, he didn’t fly far before he forcefully stopped himself.

Yang Ye touched his throat, and there was a shallow mark there. However, his skin hadn’t been penetrated. He raised his head and gazed at Liu Sha, “Looks like you intend to betray the sect!”

“Betray it?” Liu Sha spoke fiercely, “I dare not do that. Enmity has formed between us, and I’m afraid I wouldn’t be able to sleep and eat in peace if I don’t kill you now! Ye Zhan, Duan Lang, if he isn’t killed today, then I, the Ye Clan, and the Broken Saber Villa will be annihilated. So, stop holding back and fucking use your trump cards!”

Ferocious expressions instantly appeared in the eyes of Ye Zhan and the others when they heard him. Just as Liu Sha had said, they would be the ones to die if Yang Ye didn’t. Not only would they die, the clans and sects which stood behind them would be annihilated as well!

“Grandpa Ye, you join forces with Brother Liu and deal with him. I’ll go capture those 2 women from the Fan Clan!” As soon as he finished speaking, Duan Lang’s figure shot swiftly towards the carriage. At the same time, both Ye Zhan and Liu Sha immediately charged at Yang Ye.

Om!

Suddenly, a sword howl shot into the sky, and then Duan Lang’s head flew off into the air. Meanwhile, his body was still charging towards the carriage, and it shot forward for around 3m before finally crashing to the ground!

“Duan Lang!” Ye Yue was stunned for a moment, and then she ran madly towards Duan Lang’s corpse.

Ye Zhan and Liu Sha stopped moving, and they gazed at Yang Ye with astonishment. A sword had suddenly appeared in Yang Ye’s grasp.

“Trash!” Yang Ye waved his sword about and said, “All of you are trash!” When he spoke up to this point, he gazed at Liu Sha and said, “Liu Sha, don’t blame me for not giving you a chance. Kill Ye Zhan and compensate me with 10,000 extreme-grade energy stones, and I’ll let bygones be bygones. After all, it’s a disgrace for us to be killing each other, and I don’t want those above me to have a bad impression of me! Of course, you can also join forces with him to kill me. Hehe....”

As he finished speaking, there was a strange smile on Yang Ye’s face, and that smile caused Liu Sha’s heart to feel cold.

“Yang Ye! I’ll kill you!” Meanwhile, Ye Yue suddenly charged at Yang Ye.

“Yue’er! Come back here quickly! You aren’t a match for him!” Ye Zhan was horrified and was about to act. However, a ray of light flashed, and then Ye Yue’s body was split into half at the waist. Fresh blood surged out from within her while her internal organs splattered all over the ground. It was beyond bloody!

Ye Zhan’s eyes almost split apart from the rage he felt, and the profound energy within him started surging madly. Meanwhile, Liu Sha was astounded, and he subconsciously took a step back. At this moment, he wouldn’t believe it even if Yang Ye said that he wasn’t from the Dao Order.

“Yang Ye! I’ll chop you into pieces!” Ye Zhan roared and was about to attack. But a ray of cold light suddenly attacked him from behind, and it caused his expression to change drastically. He forcefully twisted his body, tore through space, and flashed over 30m away. When he looked back, he saw that a person was standing where he stood just an instant ago, and it was Liu Sha!

“Liu Sha! What are you doing!?” Ye Zhan was furious, “Are you really believing his nonsense? Is there something wrong with you? We’ll definitely be able to eliminate him if we join forces!”

“Right, he’s absolutely right!” Yang Ye grinned, “Liu Shan, he’s absolutely right. You can consider his offer!”

Liu Sha had an indeterminate expression on his face. A short while passed before he took a deep breath, and then he smiled to Yang Ye, “Senior Brother Yang, you must be joking. We’re both from the Dao Order, so how could I possibly kill someone from my own sect? Since this old dog from the Ye Clan wants to make us kill each other, his intentions are clearly malicious. Senior Brother Yang, how about we join forces to kill him instead?”

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly while his face turned gloomy, “Liu Sha, stop playing tricks with me. I’ll give you one last chance. If you don’t kill him and hand over 10,000 extreme-grade energy stones, then I’ll cripple you right now. Of course, you can try to join forces with him and kill me!”

Liu Sha had an extremely unsightly expression on his face. The desire deep within his heart was one that desired Yang Ye’s death. However, he wasn’t confident in his ability to kill Yang Ye. Even if he joined forces with Ye Zhan! After all, every single member of the Earthly Path was an extraordinary expert and surmounting their realm of cultivation to battle those of a higher realm was as simple as eating to them!

“Liu Sha!” Ye Zhan spoke hastily when he noticed Liu Sha’s hesitance, “He’s only at the Exalt Realm while I’m a high rank Monarch Realm expert. I’m even only half a step away from the Half-Saint Realm. As for you, you can surmount your own realm of cultivation to do battle. So he’ll definitely die if we join forces!”

“Bullshit!” Liu Sha suddenly shouted at Ye Zhan, “You old dog! You truly do harbor malicious intent. You’re actually trying to drive a wedge between us! I swear that I’ll kill you today!”

Liu Sha’s figure flashed while he spoke, and he shot towards Ye Zhan.

In the end, he’d decided to kill Ye Zhan. Because Yang Ye had truly been too calm and composed from the very beginning. Moreover, Yang Ye was looking at him like a cat that was looking at a mouse, and it was filled with ridicule....

He didn’t have the slightest confidence to face Yang Ye. Especially when the baleful energy Yang Ye possessed was much stronger than his own. If he were to fight Yang Ye, then his slaughter intent would be completely useless. Conversely, while Ye Zhan was a high rank Monarch Realm expert, he was still quite confident in his ability to kill Ye Zhan. After all, Monarch Realm experts who hadn’t come from powerful sects were too weak to existences like him.

“Liu Sha! You fool! He’s definitely injured! Even if we can’t kill him, our joint forces would be sufficient to heavily injure him and force him to flee! You... you idiot!” Ye Zhan cursed as he fought Liu Sha.

At this moment, Liu Sha had made his decision. So, he completely ignored Ye Zhan’s curses and just attacked like a madman.

While Ye Zhan was at the high rank of the Monarch Realm, he didn’t have much of an advantage against Liu Sha. However, the gap in their cultivations made it so that Liu Sha wasn’t able to gain an advantage over him as well. So, they were in a deadlock. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Yang Ye wasn’t standing by idly either.

“Watch out on your right. Dodge. Move forward. Stab towards the upper right....” As the 2 of them fought, Yang Ye constantly told Liu Sha about Ye Zhan’s flaws. In the beginning, Liu Sha was quite doubtful, but it didn’t take long for him to realize that everything Yang Ye said was actually true.

At this moment, he felt extremely fortunate to have made such a choice.

As for Ye Zhan, he grew more and more horrified as the battle carried on. Because Liu Sha was able to anticipate his every move with Yang Ye’s guidance, and it caused him to be completely suppressed. Moreover, there had been many moments where he’d almost suffered injuries.

Ye Zhan glanced at Yang Ye who stood calmly in the distance, and he instantly aroused the intent to retreat. While Liu Sha’s cultivation was inferior to his, he couldn’t do anything to Liu Sha in a short period of time as well. Of course, he wasn’t afraid of Liu Sha, he was afraid of Yang Ye who stood there while seeming to have no intention to join the battle.

Yang Ye grew more and more mysterious and terrifying in his eyes.

“He’s going to flee!” Suddenly, Yang Ye said, “If he succeeds, then you, Liu Sha, can go to hell!”

Ye Zhan’s pupils constricted slightly when he heard Yang Ye. He hadn’t imagined that even his intent to flee had actually been noticed by Yang Ye, and it horrified him. He didn’t dare hesitate in the slightest. He immediately slapped Liu Sha back, and then pulled space apart, causing a huge hole to appear before him.

Ye Zhan was about to enter the spatial rift and teleport away. However, Liu Sha suddenly shouted, “Shadow Strike!”

As soon as he finished speaking, the smell of blood suddenly appeared here, and then Liu Sha’s figure transformed into a ray of blood red light that vanished on the spot.

Hiss!

At the instant that Ye Zhan was about to enter the spatial rift, a stream of blood suddenly shot out from his chest. However, the spatial rift closed at the same time and Ye Zhan was a few thousand kilometers away.

Liu Shan supported himself on the ground with one of his knees, and his countenance was pale. The technique he executed earlier, Shadow Strike, was his strongest attack, and it had exhausted almost 90% of the profound energy within him!

Swoosh!

Suddenly, a ray of light flashed, and then Liu Sha’s eyes opened wide.

He asked, “Why?”

“He got away!” Yang Ye walked over to Liu Sha and continued, “Of course, you would suffer the same fate even if you killed him!”

Liu Sha asked the same question again, “Why?”

“I honor my promises to some!” Yang Ye said, “However, I prefer being shameless to some as well!”

As soon as Yang Ye finished speaking, Liu Sha’s head dropped to the ground, and a fountain of blood sprayed from his neck.

However, Yang Ye’s expression suddenly changed drastically, and the ancient sheath instantly appeared in his grasp. At the same time, he sheathed his sword in it.

“Who dares to kill a disciple of my Dao Order!?” A voice that sounded like a thunderclap resounded from the sky, and then a huge palm tore through space and clawed down forcefully at Yang Ye!

It’s a Half-Saint at least! A cold glow flashed through Yang Ye’s eyes as he said, “My Ancient Sword School!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye suddenly drew his sword.

Om!

A sword howl shot up into the air, and it shook the entire sky!
