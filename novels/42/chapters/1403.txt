Chapter 1404 – It’s Best If We Can Kill Them All!

It didn’t take long for the 3 Deities that Nangong Qin had promised Yang Ye to arrive in the hall.

After they found out that Nangong Qing wanted them to help Clouds of Heaven Stellar Region, all 3 of them fell silent. A long time passed before the white haired old man who led the group spoke solemnly, “Little Girl, you know that we think highly of you, and that’s why we’re standing on your side when it comes to succeeding your father as patriarch. I don’t want to question your decision because I know that there’s definitely a reason why you’ve done this. I just want to ask if you’re really sure. After all, if we fail, then you won’t be the only one to suffer because it’s very likely to implicate the entire merchant group!”

Nangong Qin replied, “Elder Yuan, there’s no reward without risk. I want to take this gamble.”

The 3 old men exchanged glances, and then they nodded. Elder Yuan said, “Fine, since you’ve chosen to gamble, then we’ll gamble with you.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he gazed at Yang Ye and sized up Yang Ye, “From this moment onward, the 3 of us will be following you.”

Yang Ye cupped his fist to them, and then he said, “Thank you for helping me. Let’s not waste time and leave immediately.”

They nodded, and then vanished on the spot.

Ye Liuyun spoke abruptly when Yang Ye was about to leave, “Be careful!”

Yang Ye smiled and replied, “Don’t worry, I’ll flee if we’re no match for them. You have to be careful in Stellar City as well.”

He gazed at Nangong Qin and continued, “Miss Nangong, Liuyun hadn’t established a firm foundation in the city, so please take care of her.”

“You don’t have to tell me that!” Nangong Qin rolled her eyes at him, and then she walked over to Ye Liuyun and took Ye Liuyun’s hand. She smiled, “Liuyun and I have become sworn sisters. If anyone dares to bully her in Stellar City, it’s equivalent to bullying me.”

Yang Ye glanced at her and said, “No matter what, thank you!” As soon as he finished speaking, he immediately vanished on the spot.

Ye Liuyun spoke abruptly once Yang Ye left, “Big Sister, you’re making a huge bet this time!”

Nangong Qin nodded, “It’s really huge!”

Ye Liuyun said, “He won’t disappoint you!”

“I hope so!” Nangong Qin replied softly. If Yang Ye died, then her future would be over. Moreover, she might even drag down the entire merchant group.

She couldn’t afford to lose this gamble!

...

Yang Ye led the 3 Deities through the teleportation formation on Stellar City and arrived at Celestial Demon Stellar Region.

Needless to say, those teleportation formations were really convenient as they really shortened the distance between stellar regions. However, it was extremely expensive as well. But it couldn’t be helped because they were the only providers of teleportation formations in this universe!

Elder Yuan spoke solemnly, “Brother Yang, are you really going to launch a surprise attack on Celestial Demon Continent?” He was naturally aware of Yang Ye’s ability because Nangong Qing had given him all the information she had on Yang Ye. That was also the main reason why he’d decided to make this bet with Nangong Qin.

Yang Ye nodded, “But I’ll be going myself.”

The 3 old men exchanged glances, and then Elder Yuan said, “You don’t want us to go with you? Or do you think that we’re burdens to you?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “I have no intention to look down on all of you. What I mean is that I’ll head to Celestial Demon City while you three head to other worlds in the stellar region. Once you get there, plunder all their Divine Grade spirit veins and Saint Grade spirit veins. It’s best if you don’t leave even one behind!”

Elder Yuan was astounded, “You intend to rob Celestial Demon Stellar Region?”

Yang Ye nodded, “I’ll head to Celestial Demon Continent, and I’ll keep them busy there. So, feel free to plunder their spirit veins. But be fast and prioritize plundering the spirit veins. Of course, if it’s possible, you can kill a few on your way. However, don’t waste time. Right, all of you can keep the spirit veins you gain!”

They couldn’t help but be quite tempted when they heard this. Celestial Demon Stellar Region was a three star stellar region. Besides Celestial Demon Continent which was a medium world, it had many other small worlds, and those small worlds definitely had Divine Grade spirit veins. Yang Ye was attacking Celestial Demon Continent, and it was equivalent to keeping most of the experts of Celestial Demon Stellar Region busy. Moreover, those small worlds would have a limited number of experts. In short, Yang Ye was letting them make a fortune!

Their impression of Yang Ye instantly became much better!

Elder Yuan hesitated for a moment and said, “Celestial Demon Continent might have at least 2 Deities present there. So, should I go with you?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “We’re not going there to destroy them. Our objective is to steal, steal everything they have. So, please be fast. Because we have to retreat before their experts rush back. So, we don’t have much time.”

Elder Yuan nodded and said, “Alright, be careful!”

As soon as he finished speaking, the 3 of them vanished into the depths of the starry sky around him.

Once they left, the ancient sheath appeared in Yang Ye’s grasp. At the same time, the Sword Precursor appeared within it.

Yang Ye remained silent on the spot for a short while, and then he vanished. It didn’t take long for him to arrive in the sky above Celestial Demon Continent. He didn’t enter it directly. Just as Nangong Qin had said, there were powerful restrictions and formations around it, and he would definitely activate them if he tried to enter by force.

Yang Ye held the ancient sheath in his grasp as he stood silently in midair for quite some time. Suddenly, his profound energy surged madly.

He was waiting!

He was waiting for the Deities on the continent to come out themselves. Elder Yuan and the others should be about to start plundering the small worlds of Celestial Demon Stellar Region. At that time, the Deities on Celestial Demon Continent would definitely head out to help, and that would be his opportunity.

If two came out, then he would let them leave, and then attack the continent once they left. But if only one came out....

Bang!

Suddenly, a terrifying aura shot up into the air from below.

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly. He knew that Elder Yuan and the others had started.

Yang Ye stared fixedly at the continent below him while he held tightly onto the hilt of his sword. It didn’t take long for a ray of light to shoot up from below.

A single Deity!

Yang Ye didn’t hesitate at all. Blink immediately appeared on his back, and then he vanished on the spot. He was above the ray of light when his figure appeared once more.

“You... you are....” A surprised and bewildered voice resounded.

Obviously, that Deity was quite stunned. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Yang Ye would naturally not answer. He didn’t waste his breath at all and immediately drew his sword and swung it. Once he drew his sword, he didn’t stop and quickly sheathed it once more, and then he drew it again!

Two true Heavenrends overlapped over each other!

“Ah!!” A shrill cry resounded in the sky above Celestial Demon Continent, and it was so loud that it practically resounded throughout the continent.

“How dare you!” It didn’t take long for a furious howl to resound abruptly through the continent, and then a beam of light shot up into the air. A black robed old man arrived where the previous Deity had been. But at this moment, he only saw a Deity who’d been slashed into two!

The black robed old man was horrified when he witnessed this scene.

A Deity had been killed in an instant!

Someone had actually killed a Deity in an instant!

The black robed old man waved his right hand, and then the space around him instantly started to condense in layers and form a solid spatial barrier. Once he was done with that, his divine sense swept out towards the surroundings and instantly covered a massive area. A short while passed before the old man’s face gradually became unsightly because he hadn’t noticed anything.

Not even 2 breaths of time had passed since that Deity had been killed, but the enemy had actually vanished without a trace in just that amount of time.

The old man’s face grew even gloomier.

Suddenly, a middle aged man appeared before the black robed old man. The middle aged man bowed and said, “Elder Zun, I just received word that there are experts plundering the spirit veins in the other worlds within our stellar region. Based on our initial estimations, there are at least 3 experts, and all of them are Deities!”

3 Deities! The old man slowly clenched his fists, and he remained silent for a short while before he said, “Notify the Demon Lord. Tell him that there are forces assisting Clouds of Heaven Stellar Region and we await his orders!”

The middle aged man nodded, withdrew a transmission talisman, and crushed it. Around 10 breaths of time passed before the space in front of the middle aged man started rippling.

A moment of silence ensued before the middle aged man spoke in a low voice, “The Demon Lord wants you to ignore the other worlds and just protect Celestial Demon Continent.”

The black robed old man asked, “The Demon Lord isn’t sending back any experts?”

The middle aged man shook his head and replied, “The Demon Lord said that once Clouds of Heaven Stellar Region is crushed, these powers that are assisting it in secret will be just like clowns, and we can crush them with ease.”

The old man asked, “When are they launching the final assault on Clouds of Heaven Stellar Region?”

The middle aged man replied, “They’ve already started.”

The black robed old man nodded and said, “I understand!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he glanced coldly at the surroundings, and then vanished with the middle aged man.

Around 4 hours after they left, Yang Ye appeared there. At this moment, he’d finished recovering completely within the Primordial Pagoda.

He hadn’t left just now. So, he’d heard everything the black robed old man and the middle aged man had said.

Celestial Demon Stellar Region had started the final assault on Clouds of Heaven Stellar Region!

Yang Ye gazed at Celestial Demon Continent for a long time, and then he withdrew a transmission talisman and crushed it. Around 15 minutes later, the space around him trembled, and then Elder Yuan’s group of 3 appeared by his side.

Elder Yuan was puzzled, “Brother Yang?”

Yang Ye said, “I’ve received news that the Demon Lord has launched the final assault on Clouds of Heaven Stellar Region. In other words, they won’t be coming back. Two hours, we only have two hours. We’re going to kill as many as we can in these two hours. It’s best if we can kill them all!”

Elder Yuan spoke solemnly, “Brother Yang, what if Clouds of Heaven Stellar Region is captured?”

“Don’t worry, I know what I’m doing.” As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye’s eyes instantly turned blood red. He stomped his right foot down and transformed into a ray of light that shot down towards Celestial Demon Continent.

Elder Yuan and the others exchanged glances, and then they charged down towards the continent as well!
