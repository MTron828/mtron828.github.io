Chapter 2815 – Dao Annihilation!

High above in the clouds.

Yang Ye looked the woman in the eyes, and she smiled, “Of course, you can attack me too. You can choose what to do!”

Yang Ye walked over to her and sat down. He gazed at the board, and it was a game in progress. Moreover, his side was in a hopeless situation. It would take two moves at most for him to lose.

Or it should be said that he would definitely lose!

It was a game bound for defeat!

Yang Ye looked up at her, “Can we start again?”

She shook her head, “The board is like the universe, the Three Dimensional Universe, and the situation here is what it is like for the Three Dimensional Universe. If you wish to play again, you must possess the strength to defeat me. But tell me, can you do that right now?”

Yang Ye spoke solemnly, “That’s unfair!”

The woman in a plain dress smiled, “There is no such thing as fairness in this world.”

Yang Ye gazed at the board and fell silent.

She was in no rush, “I like playing GO because I feel it’s like the Sword Dao and the Dao of man, even the Dao of the vast universe. It contains everything, and so playing GO is like comprehending the Dao.”

She pointed behind Yang Ye, “In the past, I felt Monarch Yan wasn’t bad, and so I played with him. Unfortunately, he didn’t understand what I meant, nor was he able to comprehend anything from the game. It was quite a pity!”

Yang Ye looked up at her, “You use the Three Dimensional Universe and Four Dimensional Universe as your board, the myriad of living beings in those universes are like the pieces in your game, and you are the player who controls everything.”

The woman in a plain dress chuckled, “Laws! There is a type of law in the boundless universe, like the rising and setting of the sun, high and low tides, or even life and death… There are too many of them in this universe, and I consider the Dao as Laws.”

Yang Ye spoke solemnly, “You’ve broken these laws, and so you’ve broken the Dao. You’ve ascended the Dao!”

Her smile grew even brighter, “You’re the first to realize my realm of cultivation. After attaining the Destiny Transcendence Realm, I used countless years of time to research a new realm of cultivation, the Dao Transcendence Realm. Dao Transcendence represents breaking free of the laws and transcending the Grand Dao.”

She pointed at the board, “Life is like a game of GO, and I stand beyond the board!”

Yang Ye looked her in the eyes, “You’ve transcended the Dao, so why are you trying to destroy the board?”

She smiled and remained silent.

Yang Ye gazed at her. A few breaths of time passed before his pupils constricted, “Y-You plan to attempt Dao Annihilation!”

“Haha!” She suddenly started laughing. It seemed very casual and natural, and it felt very comfortable to others. It wasn’t arrogant or haughty at all.

She laughed for a while before looking at Yang Ye again, “You’re correct. Unfortunately, there’s no reward for that!”

Yang Ye stared at her, and he naturally felt shocked.

She had broken free of the board and the universe. She had successfully broken free of the Laws of the universe, and successfully transcended the Dao. However, it wasn’t the end, she wanted to go further!

Dao Annihilation!

It was the annihilation of all living beings in the universe!

She wasn’t being willful when she decided to destroy both the universes, nor was she doing it for fun. It was to attain the Dao!

To attain the Dao!

Yang Ye clenched his hands slowly. She was far ahead of this entire universe.

She suddenly asked, “Will you still play?”

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts and gazed at the board, “I still don’t understand one thing.”

She smiled, “What?”

Yang Ye replied, “You want to destroy the Dao, so why do you leave all of us, all of us who oppose you, to do as we please?”

She grinned, “I won’t answer that now because you’ll find out very soon.”

She pointed at the board, “Let’s play.”

Yang Ye fell silent.

She smiled, “Looks like you need some motivation.”

She pressed his right palm down.

Eternal Border.

Justice suddenly descended by 300m!

Bang!

In an instant, Eternal Border turned ethereal. It wasn’t just Eternal Border, the entire universe could be said to have turned ethereal. Moreover, it seemed to have destroyed something during its descent, causing the Laws of the universe to actually gradually start falling into disorder. For example, water started to flow in the opposite direction, or flower buds starting to wither before they even bloomed… Everything in the world had suddenly become unusual!

Countless in Eternal Border looked up at Justice!

It wasn’t a sword, it was a Dao, a Dao that had transcended the entire universe!

All the living beings throughout the Three Dimensional Universe sensed death at this moment!

Yang Ye looked down from up in the clouds. He could see everything, and the Three Dimensional Universe was in chaos again. It wasn’t chaos caused by people, but the Laws of the world!

However, Yang Ye was very well aware that it wouldn’t take long for the people to fall into chaos as well!

Yang Ye gazed at the woman in a plain dress. Everything would be over if she was dead. But the problem was, could he kill her? Even if he couldn’t kill her, destroying her Dao would work too, but how would he accomplish that?

She suddenly smiled, “I sense the desire to kill, but your desire to kill doesn’t seem very firm and there’s some hesitance in it.”

Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly picked up a piece and put it down. He’d actually just put it down at random and without any strategy.

She smiled and placed a piece of the board as well. At this moment, Yang Ye had practically no pieces left. He may have had a chance before this, yet now, he had no chance.

She gazed at the board, “Continue! Everything can end once this game is over!”

Yang Ye placed another piece on the board.

Without any hesitation at all!

This piece was meaningless as well.

She placed a piece on the board as well, and Yang Ye was instantly pushed into a corner.

She smiled, “You’ve lost.”

There was undisguised disappointment in her eyes. She had hoped for a pleasant surprise, but Yang Ye hadn’t given that to her!

She raised her right hand and was about to lower it. If she did that, Justice would descend, the entire Three Dimensional Universe would be history.

Suddenly, Yang Ye said, “If you don’t mind, let me say a few words.”

She gazed at Yang Ye and smiled, “Of course!”

Yang Ye stood up, “Once that sword of yours descends, everything will be destroyed!”

She shook her head, “Destruction may not lead to the end, it may be the beginning!”

Yang Ye gazed at her, “Since everything still exists, there is meaning behind them all. Yet you plan to destroy it all for your own selfish intentions to attain the Dao. As far as I’m concerned, that is wrong.”

She looked Yang Ye in the eyes, “Right and wrong isn’t determined by words.”

Yang Ye nodded, “Then let’s fight!”

She nodded, “Alright.”

As soon as she said that, Yang Ye suddenly drew his sword, and it was extremely swift. It was impeccable in both strength and speed, and if he executed this in the Three Dimensional Universe, it could be used as material in a book!

However, it was stopped by two jade white fingers.

The woman in a plain dress’ fingers!

She gazed at Yang Ye, grinned, and said, “It’s a very good attack. Your training with them wasn’t done in vain. Unfortunately, the sword’s true strength doesn’t come from strength or speed, it's from its state and the Grand Dao.”

She waved her fingers gently.

Bam!

The Sword Precursor cracked apart while Yang Ye was pushed backward repeatedly.Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

She stood up and walked slowly in Yang Ye’s direction while a smile still remained on her face, “Yang Ye, I told you that I need the Sprite Progenitor. Now, it’s time to take her!”

Yang Ye wiped off the blood on the corner of his mouth, “You’re already so strong, so what do you need her for?”

The woman in a plain dress grinned, “She represents goodness, and that is a Grand Dao of the world. I want to annihilate the Dao, all the Daos, not just the Dao of man.”

Meanwhile, Snowy appeared on Yang Ye’s shoulder. She glared at the woman in a plain dress while holding a fiery bolt of lightning and a black lotus in each of her paws. They were Monarch Yan’s treasures!

Snowy glared at her, and then waved her paws. Obviously, she was warning the woman!

The woman in a plain dress shook her head and smiled, “You’re much weaker than you were all those years ago.”

She tapped her finger forward, and a ray of sword energy shot forward. It instantly appeared before Snowy.

Suddenly, Yang Ye grabbed Snowy and tossed her into the Primordial Pagoda, and then he swung his sword with both hands!

How could he dare to act carelessly before her?

At this moment, he’d even activated the Fate Sword Domain!

However, it shattered as soon as it appeared!

Even though the Fate Sword Domain had shattered, Yang Ye’s Fate Sword Dao was at its peak! Because he sensed the aura of death!

Yang Ye’s sword slashed against the sword energy.

Boom!

Yang Ye’s body cracked open while blood sprayed repeatedly from his mouth!

“Argh!” Yang Ye howled with fury as he pushed both his hands forward.

Hiss!

The sword energy was slashed apart by this second attack of his, and just a moment later, he appeared in front of the woman in a plain dress.

She shook her head and smiled, and then she treated her fingers as a sword as she tapped it forward. A hair-thin strand of sword energy shot forward.

Bang!

Yang Ye was instantly blasted away!

She walked slowly in Yang Ye’s direction, “Yang Ye, I’ve told you, it’s not strength and speed that make a sword strong, it’s the state of the wielder and the Sword Dao. My Sword Dao is superior to yours, both in strength and number, so your sword is of no threat to me.”

Yang Ye wiped off the blood on the corner of his mouth and cracked a smile, “I can’t do anything about that! I can only risk my life, right?”

The woman in a plain dress nodded and smiled, “That’s true! Aren’t you skilled in closer quartered combat? Let’s compete in that!”

As soon as she finished speaking, she appeared before Yang Ye.

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly as he stabbed his sword forward.

Meanwhile, she grabbed the tip of Yang Ye’s sword with her thumb and index finger, and before Yang Ye could even react, her fingers moved along the blade and swiped at him.

A ray of sword energy flashed before Yang Ye’s eyes.

Hiss! Hiss!

A strand of blood sprayed.

Yang Ye moved 300m back, but he was too slow. His eyes were shut tight as two streams of blood slowly flowed down the corners of his eyes.

The woman shook her head and smiled, and then she made a clawing motion in Yang Ye’s direction, causing a white little thing to appear in her grasp!

Snowy!
