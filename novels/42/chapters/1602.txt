Chapter 1603 - Invincible!

Translator: InVader

The Nether Pavilion’s Master!

Yang Ye was shocked. He looked up and saw a woman was walking over slowly from far away in outer space.

Their pavilion master is a woman? Yang Ye frowned. He gazed at her face, but he was shocked to realize that he was actually unable to see it.

The woman wasn’t wearing anything over her face, but he couldn’t see it clearly!

Yang Ye looked towards Little Sky, “Can you see her face?”

Little Sky glanced at Yang Ye and nodded.

Yang Ye asked, “Then why can’t I?”

Little Sky fell silent for a moment, and then she replied, “You’re too weak.”

Yang Ye felt speechless.

Meanwhile, the Pavilion Master of Nether Pavilion suddenly said, “I thought subduing this universe would be absolutely easy for my Nether Pavilion. I never expected that we wouldn’t just be unable to subdue it, we would even suffer tremendous losses. I was careless.” 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

As she spoke, she gazed at Little Sky, “This is your final chance. If you surrender, my Nether Pavilion won’t carry out a slaughter; if you refuse, my Nether Pavilion will annihilate all the Sprite Kings and Eyes of the Heaven Dao in this universe!”

As soon as she finished speaking, the space behind her trembled, and then a white haired old man and ten middle aged men appeared there.

Yang Ye’s face fell because the white haired old man’s aura wasn’t any weaker to the Left Guardian. As for the ten middle aged men, their auras were extremely terrifying as well. They were clearly not ordinary Rebirth Realm experts!

The Nether Pavilion was here in full force.

Yang Ye gazed at Little Sky. Whether they fought or surrendered fully depended on Little Sky’s decision.

Little Sky closed her eyes slightly. She remained silent for a long time before opening her eyes again, and then she glanced at the experts of the Nether Pavilion, “You think I’m easy to bully?”

As soon as she finished speaking, she took a step forward and raised her hands, “In my name, I summon the strength of all things!”

As soon as she finished speaking, the entire world started to become ethereal.

At the same time, the entire Sky Sky Continent… No, everything in all the worlds throughout Merak System suddenly started trembling. A moment of silence ensued, and then countless strands of energy suddenly converged towards Little Sky from all directions.

Moreover, the Sprite Kings and even Snowy released the energy within them and transmitted it to Little Sky.

“The Lord of the Heaven Dao!” Fan Yinyu spoke solemnly.

The Lord of the Heaven Dao!

At this moment, Little Sky’s identity was obvious. Besides the Lord of the Heaven Dao, could anyone else command Eyes of the Heaven Dao, the Sprite Kings, and even summon the energy of all things?

Actually, they’d guessed she was the Lord of the Heaven Dao, but they were even more certain now.

Yang Ye gazed at Little Sky, “You’ve recovered your memories?”

Little Sky shook her head, “It isn’t important anymore.”

As she spoke, she looked up at the Nether Pavilion’s Master. A moment later, her figure vanished on the spot, and she was in front of the Nether Pavilion’s Master when her figure appeared once more.

Boom!

A muffled explosion resounded. Yang Ye and the others watched with astonishment as the Nether Pavilion’s Master was blasted around 10km back. At the same time, Little Sky had grabbed the armored woman’s throat before anyone here could react.

Little Sky gazed coldly at her, “Even though Little Wheel had no intention to continue living, he died because of you. So, pay for his life!”

As soon as she finished speaking, she suddenly squeezed down.

Crack!

The sound of bones breaking resounded, and then the armored woman’s head was twisted off her neck.

Yang Ye couldn’t help but glance at Little Sky when he witnessed this scene. It seems like she’s really angry.

Indeed. The Nether Pavilion had really gone too far this time.

Little Sky casually tossed away the armored woman’s head, and then she gazed at the Left Guardian. A moment later, she appeared in front of the Left Guardian. After that, the Left Guardian was blasted around 10km away!

She’s strong! Yang Ye was shocked. He hadn’t expected her to be so strong. She was simply crushing her opponents!

But it did make sense. After all, Little Sky possessed the strength of all things. So, fighting her was no different than fighting the entire Merak System.

Meanwhile, Little Sky suddenly gazed at Sky Maiden, “Are Eyes of the Heaven Dao tasty?”

Sky Maiden’s eyes narrowed slightly, and then a huge mouth appeared above Little Sky before descending down to bite her.

Little Sky’s face remained indifferent as she twisted her right palm and slapped it upwards.

Bang!

The huge mouth shattered into pieces, and then Little Sky appeared in front of Sky Maiden before slapping her palm forward.

Bang!

Sky Maiden was instantly blasted over 30km away while blood seeped out incessantly from the corner of her mouth. Meanwhile, Little Sky appeared in front of her again, and then she grabbed Sky Maiden’s throat before Sky Maiden could even react.

However, an extremely terrifying wave of energy suddenly surged out from Sky Maiden.

Boom!

Little Sky was blasted around 300m back. Meanwhile, the space in front of Sky Maiden was being devoured by a form of mysterious energy. It devoured the space there rapidly, and it only took an instant for the energy to arrive in front of Little Sky and was about to devour her too.

Meanwhile, Little Sky suddenly pushed her palm forward. Just that movement caused the mysterious energy to immediately stop on the spot. At the same time, the space which had been devoured by the mysterious energy was instantly returned to normal.

“The ability to devour?” Little Sky shook her head, “It’s not enough!”

As soon as she finished speaking, she clenched her fist and slammed it forward.

Pu!

Bang!

A mouthful of blood sprayed from Sky Maiden while her figure was blasted over 15km away!

Little Sky was about to attack again when the Nether Pavilion’s Master appeared in front of Little Sky, and then she tapped her right hand at Little Sky. In an instant, the space before her acted like a lake that had been struck by a rock, and it started rippling. After that, the space in an area of 3km around Little Sky cracked apart and collapsed!

Qin and the others’ expressions changed at the sight of this. Qin was about to lend a hand, but the collapsing space suddenly started healing swiftly. In less than a breath of time, the space in the area where Little Sky had been standing on had been completely repaired. As for Little Sky herself, she was standing on the spot while seeming to be completely unharmed.

Little Sky walked towards the Nether Pavilion’s Master as she said, “Since Merak System was formed, it has never surrendered to anyone or any power. My Merak System doesn’t invade others, but it won’t allow others to invade it or surrender to others. Your Nether Pavilion has invaded my Merak System, so I, Little Sky, represent Merak System to officially declare war against your Nether Pavilion. Any member of the Nether Pavilion who has stepped foot into my Merak System can dream about leaving!”

As soon as she finished speaking, she clenched her right fist slowly. A moment later, she suddenly slammed it at the over 500 Rebirth Realm experts from the Nether Pavilion who were standing in the distance.

Bang!

An explosion erupted in the crowd, and then over 20 Rebirth Realm experts were actually blasted into bits!

Yang Ye’s eyelids twitched at the sight of this. She’s absolutely formidable!

The experts of the Nether Pavilion were shocked by Little Sky’s strength as well. After all, she’d killed over 20 Rebirth Realm experts with a single punch, and she’d done so with such ease. So, such strength…

Fan Yinyu suddenly went over to the Nether Pavilion’s Master’s side and said, “She’s being supported by the strength of all things right now, so she’s invincible in Merak System. Pavilion Master, our Nether Pavilion can’t go head on against her right now!”

A moment of silence ensued before the Pavilion Master nodded slightly and said, “All of you retreat first.”

Fan Yinyu hesitated for a moment and nodded. She waved her right hand, and the other experts immediately shot upwards towards outer space.

“You think you can escape?” A wisp of ridicule curled up on the corners of Little Sky’s mouth, and then she waved her hand, “World Seal!”

As soon as she finished speaking, a wave of mysterious energy instantly appeared above Sky Sky Continent. The energy was like a huge net that instantly enveloped the entire continent. At the same time, the Sky Devil Beast pounced forward towards the Left Guardian and the others.

Snowy and the Sprite Kings behind her didn’t stand by idly as well. They immediately attacked, and numerous pillars of light shot towards the experts from the Nether Pavilion.

Meanwhile, the Pavilion Master was just about to attack when Little Sky suddenly appeared in front of her, and she slapped her palm at her.

She didn’t dodge and similarly slapped her palm at Little Sky.

Bang!

The Pavilion Master was blasted 3km away while Little Sky was merely pushed around 300m back!

At this moment, Little Sky was being supported by the energy of all things. Just as Fan Yinyu had said, she was invincible in Merak System!

However, the Nether Pavilion’s Master was extremely strong as well. Even though she was being supported by the energy of all things, she could only push her back and couldn’t kill her. But if this continued over a long period of time, then the Nether Pavilion’s Master’s defeat in Merak System was only a matter of time!

After all, his opponent was Little Sky. At this moment, she wasn’t a single person but represented the entire Merak System.

The Nether Pavilion’s forces were gradually being suppressed, and their experts were falling in succession.

Suddenly, the area of space that had been sealed off by Little Sky had started to tremble, and it didn’t take long for a point in space there to be torn open. After that, a white haired old man walked out slowly from within. There were over 20 white robed old men behind the white haired old man!

All of them were at the Rebirth Realm!

Moreover, the white haired old man was that same old man from Ringworld System that had come to speak with Little Sky.

The white haired old man glanced at the situation below before looking at the Nether Pavilion’s Master, “Let’s join forces. This world will go to your Nether Pavilion. My Ringworld System only wants the Lord of the Heaven Dao or her soul…” The old man turned to look at Snowy, and then he continued, “And that Sprite Lord or her soul!”

The Nether Pavilion’s Master fell silent for a moment and said, “Alright!”

Snowy glanced at the Nether Pavilion’s Master, and then she glanced at the old man from Ringworld System. A moment later, her figure shook and instantly appeared before Yang Ye, and then she hid on Yang Ye’s shoulder.

Yang Ye patted her head lightly before he looked up at the old man, “Why do you want the Sprite Lord’s soul?”

The old man spoke indifferently, “My Young Master is refining a treasure, and he needs an equipment spirit. That Sprite Lord is just right for it.”

Yang Ye looked the old man in the eyes, “I need a chamber pot, and I think your young master’s head is just right. Give it to me, alright?”
