Chapter 1626 - It Spoiled My Mental State!

Translator: InVader

Enslaved by the sword!

Have I been enslaved by the sword?

Yang Ye asked himself that question.

Of course, the sword here represented the Sword Dao!

As far as he was concerned, he wasn’t enslaved by the sword. Because he felt that he controlled it, and it wasn’t the one which controlled him. The user was the reason a sword was strong. The reason his sword was strong wasn’t his sword but him.

The sword was extraordinary because of its user!

That was what he’d thought in the past!

But… But… can I give up the sword? Or more precisely, can I give up the Sword Dao?

Giving up the Sword Dao represented that he would lose many things, and it may even include his life.

So, the answer was naturally a no!

If he gave up the sword, he would lose many things. But if the sword didn’t have him, it would still be a sword, and it would still exist.

Simply speaking, he couldn’t do without the sword, but the sword could do without him. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

That was the difference!

Thus, it was obvious who was enslaved!

Yang Ye stared at the wooden sword. Suddenly, he started walking in its direction.

Lu Lige was stunned by this scene, and then he quickly moved forward to obstruct Yang Ye’s path, “What are you doing?”

Yang Ye pointed at the wooden sword, “It spoiled my mental state! It must be eliminated!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye vanished on the spot, and he was before the wooden sword when he appeared once more. After that, Yang Ye slammed his fist at it while everyone else watched with astonishment.

Lu Lige’s face instantly turned ghastly pale, “Brother, you can’t do that. We’ll be killed…”

Meanwhile, a ray of cold light appeared before Yang Ye when his fist was just about to slam against the wooden sword.

Bang!

An explosion resounded, and then Yang Ye was blasted around 300m back.

A man in luxurious robes appeared before the wooden sword. He gazed at Yang Ye and said, “You can only look, not touch.”

Yang Ye had just stopped himself and intended to charge forward again. Meanwhile, Lu Lige obstructed his path again, “Brother, what are you doing? This is the Wu Clan. You can’t act rashly! Calm down!”

Yang Ye shook his head, “Those words spoiled my mental state. If I don’t eliminate them, then I’ll probably be incapable of moving a step forward on my path of cultivation. As far as I’m concerned, all obstacles should be eliminated!”

As soon as he finished speaking, his figure shot towards the wooden sword again.

Lu Lige was stunned, “All obstacles should be eliminated… Brother, you’re too overbearing…”

Everyone here was stunned when they saw Yang Ye attack again. Obviously, they hadn’t expected someone to dare to cause trouble in the Wu Clan.

Meanwhile, the eyes of the man in a luxurious robe narrowed, and a cold glow flickered in them. After that, he slammed his fist forward.

At the same time, Yang Ye, who’d arrived before the man, had slammed his fist forward as well.

Bang!

An explosion resounded, and then both of them were pushed around 1km back.

The man glanced at his own fist, and then looked up at Yang Ye, “Striking straight at the internal organs and making energy rebound. It’s quite an interesting technique.” As soon as he finished speaking, he tapped his right foot against the ground and transformed into a wisp of smoke that appeared in front of Yang Ye.

Bang!

Yang Ye wasn’t even able to react before his figure was blasted around 1km away. However, as soon as he stopped himself, his figure vanished once more.

Bang! Bang! Bang!

At the same time Yang Ye’s figure vanished, numerous explosions resounded. Because Yang Ye and the man were too swift, so many here weren’t able to see them clearly and could only hear explosions!

At this moment, everyone here was curious. They were curious about Yang Ye. After all, someone who dared to cause trouble in the Wu Clan was definitely not an ordinary person!

Meanwhile, Lu Lige gulped as he watched the intense battle between Yang Ye and the man, “There isn’t a single normal person in the Yang Clan. If I stay with him, then not to mention getting the Rebirth Fruit, I might even lose my life…”

Bang!

Meanwhile, the space in the surroundings shook violently, and then Yang Ye and the man were both pushed around 3km back respectively.

“The Undying Realm!” The man glanced at Yang Ye, “Who are you?”

Yang Ye spoke indifferently, “The Yang Clan! Yang Yan is my young master!”

The Yang Clan!

Everyone here immediately came to an understanding when they heard Yang Ye. It made absolute sense if Yang Ye was from the Yang Clan. After all, the people from that clan were quite insane. Moreover, the Yang Clan and Wu Clan’s strength was almost equal, so they didn’t fear the Wu Clan. However, everyone didn’t understand why someone working for Yang Yan would come and cause trouble in the Wu Clan!

“The Yang Clan? Yang Yan?” The man’s eyes narrowed slightly, “It was your young master who ordered you to cause trouble here?”

Yang Ye nodded, and then he pointed at the wooden sword, “My young master said that he wants that wooden sword. So, I was sent to get it. I advise you to hand it over obediently. Otherwise…”

“How laughable!” The young man laughed coldly, “Who does he think he is?! Not to mention a young master of the Yang Clan, my Wu Clan wouldn’t even fear the actual successor of the Yang Clan. My Wu Clan doesn’t offend others unless offended by others. Since your Yang Clan is looking for trouble with my Wu Clan, then don’t blame me for showing no mercy.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he pointed his right index finger forward, “Void Piercer!”

In an instant, countless rays of finger-thick beams of light pierced through the space around Yang Ye. In the end, they shot down at Yang Ye like a storm. It only took an instant for them to envelop him.

Yang Ye’s expression remained calm and indifferent as he watched them shoot towards him, and then he clenched his right fist tightly. After that, he slammed it forward!

Heaven Obliteration!

Boom!

In an instant, the beams of light were obliterated. Moreover, the space around him started to ripple violently as if it would collapse at any moment.

The man in a luxurious robed glanced at Yang Ye’s fist and said, “Your fist technique isn’t bad, and it’s stronger than the technique from before. Come, try another move of mine.”

As he spoke, he was about to attack again. Suddenly, Lu Lige appeared in front of Yang Ye, and he said, “I heard the geniuses of the Wu Clan were strong. I’d like to see for myself today.”

“You…” Yang Ye was quite shocked as he gazed at Lu Lige. Obviously, he hadn’t expected Lu Lige to suddenly interfere in the battle.

Lu Lige glanced at him and spoke via voice transmission, “Hurry up while I keep him busy. Remember to be fast. Because there are other experts of the Wu Clan hiding in the shadows. You won’t be able to destroy it if you aren’t fast enough.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he drew his saber and charged at the man.

“A saber cultivator!” The man glanced at Lu Lige, and then he slapped his palm forward from afar. The space before him warped, and it only took an instant for a warped energy palm to flash out from space and slap down towards Lu Lige.

“Slash!” Lu Lige grabbed his saber with both hands and swung it down.

Hiss!

A ray of saber energy that was 300m long flashed out from the saber in Lu Lige’s grasp.

Bang!

As soon as the saber energy and energy palm slammed against each other, they immediately exploded. In an instant, countless waves of energy surged madly in all directions. Even then, the space around them didn’t shatter, and it just rippled.

The man in luxurious robes was about to attack again, but his expression changed abruptly. He turned to look towards the wooden sword. Yang Ye was already in front of it.

“Don’t you dare!” He roared with fury, and he intended to charge over. He wasn’t the only one, countless other powerful auras had appeared in the surroundings, and they were surging towards Yang Ye.

Zenith Realm experts!

Yang Ye spoke indifferently before the wooden sword, “The sword enslaves the user? The user enslaves the sword? Why make it so complicated?”

As soon as he finished speaking, he slammed his fist forward.

Boom!

Everyone watched with shock as the wooden sword shattered into bits.

Lu Lige immediately broke out in cold sweat, “We’re probably finished this time.”

“Look! What’s that?!” Suddenly, someone exclaimed. The others looked over and saw that a ray of light had suddenly flashed out from within the shattered bits of the wooden sword, and then a sword howl shot up into the sky.

The man in a luxurious robe stopped when he witnessed this scene. Meanwhile, four old men appeared around Yang Ye. However, they didn’t attack him. Obviously, they hadn’t expected something like this to occur.

Yang Ye looked up at the ray of light in the sky. Suddenly, the ray of light shot down from above and arrived in front of Yang Ye. In an instant, the light dispersed to reveal a small wooden sword.

The wooden sword was two fingers wide, around 1m long, and it wasn’t any different in shape to the previous wooden sword. It was just much smaller.

Yang Ye blinked as he gazed at it, and then he waved his right hand and placed the wooden sword within the Primordial Pagoda. After that, he gazed at the man in a luxurious robe, “I acted rashly earlier. I apologize. I apologize sincerely. Right, er… I have other matters to attend to, so I’ll be bidding my farewell.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he turned around and started walking away.
