Chapter 1092 – 21st On The Martial Rankings! Feng Qingyi!

They intend to split up!

Clamorous noise resounded throughout the surroundings when they heard Li Laoguai!

The reason White Deer Academy was still a Diamond Rank power was because while the Law Faction and Scholarly Faction were engaging in internal strife, they would still join forces against the enemies of their academy. That was exactly why White Deer Academy was still White Deer Academy, and it was still a Diamond Rank power.

Regardless of whether it was the Law Faction or Scholarly Faction, both of them understood this principle. So, while they frequently had their disagreements, they wouldn’t go too far.

After all, the overall situation of the academy was the most important!

In the past 1,000 over years, no matter how great the conflict between them was, White Deer Academy didn’t get to the point of splitting up because of that principle.

Yet now, the Law Faction had actually proposed to split up!

Splitting up represented that the number one academy in the Central Divine Prefecture would become history.

“White Deer Academy.... White Deer Academy shall cease to exist from now onwards....” Han Yu shook his head slightly. Once they had split up, then White Deer Academy wouldn’t be the same any longer, and it was even to the extent that the slightest mistake might cause it to drop to the ranks of Platinum Rank powers.

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings, and then he walked towards the side. He sat down cross-legged on the ground and started recuperating.

It was White Deer Academy’s business, and he had no right to interfere, nor did he want to.

Su Shihe gazed at Li Laoguai for a long time. In the end, he shook his head slightly, “Actually, my Scholarly Faction knew that this day would come, but we never expected you to raise this issue today. Since you dared to mention splitting up, I presume those ancestors of your Law Faction have agreed or tacitly agreed to it. So, it’s already decided!”

A wisp of complicated emotions flashed through Su Shihe’s eyes at this point, and he said, “My Scholarly Faction was incompetent. We were actually unable to stop the academy from splitting apart. We’ve failed Dean Xiao!”

“What’s coming will come!” Suddenly, a white robed old man appeared here. The old man’s face was covered in wrinkles, and he was horribly old. Moreover, his countenance was a sickly pale color as if he’d been inflicted with some sort of strange illness.

“Master Xiao!” Su Shihe hurriedly moved over to greet the old man, “What’re you doing here?”

“How could I still stay back when we’re going to split apart?” The white robed old man waved his hand, and then his gaze descended onto Yang Ye who was seated cross-legged on the ground, “You’re Yang Ye?”

Yang Ye nodded, “Senior, may I know who you are?”

“Xiao Bieli, the dean of White Deer Academy in name!” The white robed old man grinned, “You’re really not bad.”

Xiao Bieli turned around to gaze at Li Laoguai, “Since you want us to split up, then tell me how you intend to split everything.”

Li Laoguai spoke indifferently, “Your Scholarly Faction has to leave White Deer Dimension!”

“What a joke! Why should we!” Xiao Bieli hadn’t even spoken when Su Shihe spoke furiously, “Why shouldn’t it be your Law Faction that leaves White Deer Dimension? My Scholarly Faction has been constantly exercising forbearance throughout the years, but that was for the overall interests of the academy. Don’t even think that my Scholarly Faction is afraid of your Law Faction.”

“Exactly! Why should our Scholarly Faction leave? On what basis do you make such a decision? I’ve been unable to stand the sight of your Law Faction for a long time, if worse comes to worse, we can just fight each other!”

“The Law Faction is truly insidious. They actually intend to drive our Scholarly Faction out of White Deer Dimension. Without White Deer Dimension as our foundation, wouldn’t our Scholarly Faction be even inferior to a Platinum Rank power?”

“I seek permission to fight the Law Faction to the death!”

“I seek permission....”

The voices of countless students from the Scholarly Faction resounded. White Deer Dimension was their home, so how could they agree to being driven out by the Law Faction?”

Xiao Bieli glanced indifferently at Li Laoguai and said, “I’m sure you’ve heard them.”

Li Laoguai chuckled, “Your Scholarly Faction doesn’t want to leave, and neither does my Law Faction. If we fight here, then even if one of our sides wins, it’ll be a pyrrhic victory while White Deer Dimension will be destroyed as well. So, I have a suggestion. Why don’t we compete with each other? The winner stays, and the loser leaves! Alright?”

Xiao Bieli gazed at Li Laoguai for a long time before he said, “Do you have to do this?” Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Li Laoguai replied, “Dean Xiao, tell me, if we don’t do this, then what can we do? It’s disadvantageous for both your Scholarly Faction and my Law Faction if this continues. Because irreconcilable enmity will arise between us sooner or later. At that time, it might lead to the destruction of both our factions. A peaceful split is beneficial to both our factions!”

Xiao Bieli fell silent for a long time, and then he sighed softly, “Fine. The enmity between us will erupt like a volcano one day if we force ourselves to stay together. Is the competition you speak of one between us old fellows, or those kids?”

Li Laoguai spoke indifferently, “The academy’s future belongs to these little fellows. So, it’s naturally up to them to determine the academy’s future!”

Xiao Bieli chuckled and said, “I naturally have no problem with that. But based on the way your Law Faction does things, my Scholarly Faction really doesn’t dare to trust you. I don’t want to get into another argument later on. What do you think?”

Li Laoguai laughed coldly, “You’re afraid that my Law Faction would act shamelessly, and my Law Faction is similarly afraid that your Scholarly Faction would act shamelessly. Since both sides don’t trust each other, then why don’t we do this? Everyone from both our factions will swear on their souls, and anyone who goes back on their word will face death. Alright?”

An oath of the soul!

The expressions of everyone here changed when they heard Li Laoguai. Especially the members of the Scholarly Faction. An oath of the soul was a very restrictive oath. While a person who broke such an oath may not die, it would definitely cause inner demons to grow within that person. That wouldn’t be a problem at any other time, but when one had inner demons while charging into the Saint Realm, and especially when it was inner demons that had been created from breaking an oath of the soul, it would definitely lead to that person’s death!

As for those experts who were at the Saint Realm, they actually feared such oaths even more than those who weren’t at the Saint Realm. Because they were very well aware of how terrifying such inner demons were. They were like a nightmare that haunted one at all times.

So, practically no one would rashly make an oath with their soul!

Su Shihe walked over to Xiao Bieli’s side and spoke via voice transmission, “Master Xiao, there’s something strange about this. We have to be careful!”

Xiao Bieli nodded slightly, and then he gazed at Li Laoguai, “Looks like your Law Faction is very confident!”

“We’ll determine the victor with one battle! The winner stays, and the loser leaves. Moreover, the loser is prohibited from using the name, White Deer Academy!” Li Laoguai spoke indifferently, “Dean Xiao, will you compete or not. Tell me your decision.”

“Do it! We’ll compete with them! We have Senior Brother Feng, why would we fear them!”

“Exactly. Just Senior Brother Feng is sufficient to fight every single expert from the Law Faction. Dean Xiao, agree to the battle. It’s time to teach those arrogant fellows a lesson!”

“Who’s Senior Brother Feng?” Yang Ye asked Fang Yun who’d suddenly appeared by his side.

A wisp of fervor and admiration flashed through Fang Yun’s eyes, “The strongest expert in the younger generation of my White Deer Academy. At the same time, he’s ranked at the 21st position on the Martial Rankings. Moreover, that was his ranking a year ago. Perhaps he can be ranked in the top 20 now. The younger generation of the Law Faction are trash before him!”

21st.... Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly. He didn’t know how monstrous the geniuses on the Martial Rankings were. However, Jun Hualuo’s strength was really not bad. If An Nanjing hadn’t utilized such an ultimate move, she would have probably been unable to do anything to Jun Hualuo. However, Jun Hualuo was only ranked at the 39th position, so he could imagine how terrifying someone ranked at the 21st position would be!

But Yang Ye was puzzled because the Law Faction knew that the Scholarly Faction had such a formidable existence, so why would it propose such a competition?

Even though Li Laoguai was shameless, he was no fool!

He’s scheming something! Yang Ye glanced at Li Laoguai and the others from the Law Faction. He was sure that they were definitely scheming something.

Xiao Bieli and Su Shihe frowned as well. They were no fools. The Law Faction had suddenly proposed that they split up, and it proposed such a competition when it was clearly aware that the Scholarly Faction possessed such an extraordinary genius, so it was obvious that the Law Faction was scheming something!

“Do you agree or not?” Li Laoguai continued, “If you refuse, then our factions will have no choice but to enter a full-scale war!”

A full-scale war!

Xiao Bieli’s face fell, and a long time passed before he said, “Since your Law Faction wants to compete, then we shall. We’ll decide the victor with a single battle!”

A slight smile curled up on the corners of Li Laoguai’s mouth, “Since that’s the case, then we can start swearing now. I’ll do it first. I swear on my soul that if I don’t adhere to the results of the competition once it ends, then I, Li Laoguai, will definitely die and never enter the cycle of reincarnation.” As soon as he finished, Li Laoguai gazed at Xiao Bieli and the others, “It’s your turn now!”

Xiao Bieli and Su Shihe pondered deeply for a short while, and then they started to make their oaths.

Just like that, all the members of the Law Faction and Scholarly Faction started to swear on their souls.

Xuwu Shen spoke solemnly, “The internal strife in White Deer Academy has begun. What should we do now?”

Yang Ye pondered deeply for a short while before he replied, “Let’s just watch for now. We can’t leave no matter what. If we do, then we’ll be giving that old dog an excuse to act against us.”

Xuwu Shen nodded, “I want to see what the Law Faction is up to as well!”

Around 15 minutes later, everyone had finished their oaths.

Li Laoguai said, “Should we begin now?”

Xiao Bieli said, “You should be aware who my Scholarly Faction will be sending to represent us. But you’re still so confident. I presume that you’re really confident in the person you’re about to send to battle. Come, let me see what sort of genius has appeared in your Law Faction now!”

Li Laoguai’s roaring laughter resounded, “Hahaha! Did you hear that? Since Dean Xiao wants to meet you, then why haven’t you shown yourself?”

As soon as Li Laoguai finished speaking, a green ray of light shot down from the sky, and it didn’t take long for a green clothed man who held a green jade flute to arrive here.

“Feng Qingyi!” Everyone from the Scholarly Faction was stunned upon catching sight of that man.

A moment later, their expressions became extremely unsightly!

The green clothed man closed his eyes and said, “Besides Dean Xiao, anyone from the Scholarly Faction can join the battle. Send as many as you want!”
