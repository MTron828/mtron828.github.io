Chapter 83 – Help!

Su Qingshi nodded and said, “The Heavenrend Drawing Technique is a high-grade Profound Rank technique that a senior of my Sword Sect created. Because it only possessed two moves yet revealed enormous might, it was extremely loved by countless disciples of the Sword Sect. It could be said to be extremely popular at that time.”

Yang Ye was shocked in his heart. Never had he imagined that the Heavenrend Drawing Technique was actually a high-grade Profound Rank sword technique, and he immediately asked. “Then why has this sword technique been reduced to the Yellow Rank, and it was even buried in the Technique Pavilion?”

Su Qingshi seemed to have thought of something, and then a cold glow flashed in her eyes. She said after staying silent for some time, “The Heavenrend Sword Technique you’re cultivating now isn’t the true Heavenrend Sword Technique at all. The true technique is divided into two moves, Draw and Heavenrend. Its true ultimate move is formed when these two moves are combined. Especially when the imposing aura and force that explodes out at the instant of drawing the sword is combined with the second move, this sword technique can even compare to an Earth Rank technique!”

Yang Ye nodded, and he said to himself, No wonder.

Since he obtained this sword techniques, he’d constantly had the feeling that it was missing something, and it turned out that the technique lacked an offensive move. However, it wasn’t especially important to Yang Ye because his Reactive Strike stressed upon utilizing calmness to restrain action, and it restrained the opponent with a single move. On the other hand, the Heavenrend Sword Technique’s second move took the initiative to attack, and it stressed up seizing the initiative and imposing aura.

Perhaps the move Heavenrend was much more formidable than his Reactive Strike, yet Yang Ye still preferred the technique that he’d created himself! However, if he was able to look through that move, Heavenrend, then it would probably be quite helpful to his Reactive Strike technique.

When he thought up to here, Yang Ye asked. “Does the original still exist?”

Su Qingshi shook her head and said, “It’s gone. The senior from that time hadn’t finished recording down this sword technique before he was encircled and killed by members of the Ghost Sect. So, this sword technique can be said to be lost. Actually, the Heavenrend Drawing Technique you’re cultivating now can be considered to be the original because that senior had only finished recording the first move, and it’s this drawing technique that you’re cultivating right now!”

Yang Ye felt rather disappointed when he heard this. However, he wasn’t especially disappointed. It was lucky if he could and fate if he couldn’t. Yang Ye didn’t really mind. Moreover, he’d already obtained the first move, and it was extremely good when combined with his Reactive Strike.

Meanwhile, Su Qingshi said in a low voice, “If you encounter anyone from the Ghost Sect in the future, then kill them if you can. Because if you don’t kill them, then they’ll kill you as well. Moreover, if you kill them, you’ll be able to obtain Contribution Points!”

Yang Ye was shocked in his heart as he gazed at Su Qingshi’s icy cold expression. This woman really hates the Ghost Sect to the bone.

He still remembered that while they were at the bottom of Death Abyss, this woman wanted to kill him just because he wanted to utilize Bloodhand’s weapon. Exactly how deep is their enmity?

Moreover, Contribution Points would be provided for killing members of the Ghost Sect. What did this mean? It meant that it wasn’t just Su Qingshi who hated the Ghost Sect, and even the Sword Sect hated it. Otherwise, it would be impossible for there to be such rewards to encourage disciples of the Sword Sect to kill members of the Ghost Sect!

“Big Sister, is the Ghost Sect very bad?” Meanwhile, Little Yao who’d been listening to their conversation suddenly spoke in a slightly timid voice.

Yang Ye asked as well. “Qingshi, exactly what sort of enmity is there between our Sword Sect and the Ghost Sect?”

When she heard Yang Ye call her Qingshi, Su Qingshi’s expression became slightly uncomfortable. However, she didn’t object to it, and she just glanced at Yang Ye and said in a low voice, “A feud that has lasted through generations. The enmity between the Ghost Sect and Sword Sect has already existed for almost 100 years. Not to mention events from a long time ago, just in the recent years, quite a few elders and genius disciples of my Sword Sect were killed by the Ghost Sect. Moreover, my mother perished at the hands of the Ghost Sect as well!”

As she finished speaking, a strand of coldness suddenly erupted from Su Qingshi, and it caused Little Yao to be unable to help but press herself closer to Yang Ye’s chest.

Yang Ye’s expression changed as well. He’d never imagined that Su Qingshi’s mother would have actually perished at the hands of the Ghost Sect. No wonder she holds such hatred towards the Ghost Sect.

Yang Ye’s experiences were slightly similar to Su Qingshi, so he really understood how she felt. He immediately said, “If I encounter anyone from the Ghost Sect in the future, then I’ll definitely eliminate them!”

Yang Ye was the type of person that wouldn’t offend others so long as others didn’t offend him. However, the Ghost Sect was an exception. Because even if he didn’t kill them, they would kill him. Their sects had been in a feud for generations, and it could be said that everyone that joined the Sword Sect would become an enemy of the Ghost Sect at that very moment.

Moreover, he didn’t have a good impression of anyone in the Ghost Sect because he still remembered how Bloodhand had made a move against him and how those members of the Ghost Sect had pursued him!

When she heard Yang Ye, Su Qingshi’s gaze fluctuated slightly before she said, “Even though the Ghost Sect’s reputation is bad, their strengths are really formidable. Especially some of the strange and mysterious technique and forbidden techniques they possess. If you encounter a member of the Ghost Sect in the future, you must be careful, and you absolutely must not resist stubbornly if you’re not a match for that person!”

Yang Ye nodded and said, “I’m not an idiot that would still charge forward when I’m not a match for my opponent!”

Su Qingshi hesitated for a moment, and then she said, “Besides bringing Little Yao here so that the two of you could see each other, I came here for another reason. I have something I need your help with.”

“You need my help?” Yang Ye was slightly surprised, and he asked. “What do you need?”

Su Qingshi asked. “Do you remember when we encountered the members of the Ghost Sect in the Nether Wolf Gorge last month?”

Yang Ye nodded. “Of course I do. At that time, you said that besides Bloodhand, there were two more experts on par with Bloodhand in the vicinity. Is what you need my help with related to this matter?”

Su Qingshi nodded and said, “We suspect that the members of the Ghost Sect are hatching some plan against our Sword Sect. However, the forces we sent to the Nether Wolf Gorge were unable to notice any clues. We’re sure that they haven’t left, and they’re still hiding within Nether Wolf Gorge. But we’re unable to find where they’re hiding!”

“What do you want me to do?” asked Yang Ye.

Su Qingshi pondered deeply for a moment and asked. “Are you able to communicate with Darkbeasts?”

Yang Ye was stunned, and then he said with an astounded expression, “You want me to head to Nether Wolf Gorge to ask Darkbeasts about it?”

Su Qingshi nodded and said, “If you can communicate with Darkbeasts, then that’s exactly my intentions. Don’t worry, I never told anyone that you possess the Nether Wolf and that mysterious violet mink, and I came to look for your help in private this time. No one will find out about it.”

Yang Ye asked the little fellow, and when he saw the little fellow nod, Yang Ye said, “I can’t communicate with Darkbeasts, but the little fellow can. However, are you sure this will work?”

Su Qingshi said, “I can’t confirm that it will, but it’s the only way I can think of now. If the Darkbeasts don’t know where they’re hiding, then the Sword Sect can only increase the area of its search. Even though it’s a very disadvantageous move, the Sword Sect would have no other choice.

Yang Ye said, “Alright, let’s head to the Nether Wolf Gorge now?”

“There’s no rush!” Su Qingshi said, “In order to take precautions against any unexpected events, I have to make preparations first. I’ll come to look for you three days from now, alright?”

Yang Ye nodded and said, “Alright!”

Su Qingshi nodded lightly, and then she looked at Little Yao and said, “Let’s go. You still haven’t finished your work for today, so you can’t waste any more time!”

Little Yao gazed at Yang Ye with slight reluctance. Even though Su Qingshi was very nice to her, she still wanted to be with her older brother because it felt extremely safe while she was with her older brother.

When he noticed Little Yao’s reluctant gaze, Yang Ye felt a feeling of tenderness in his heart. He rubbed Little Yao on the head and said in a gentle voice, “Silly little girl, Big Brother is in the Sword Sect, and you’re in the Sword Sect as well. So long as you finish the work that Big Sister Su arranges for you, then you can come here to look for Big Brother. Now, go back with Big Sister Su. You have to listen to Big Sister Su, alright?”

Little Yao nodded and said in a light voice, “Big Brother, you take care of yourself as well. Little Yao will word had to become stronger. Once Little Yao becomes strong, I’ll go rescue mother with you. Little Yao will definitely work hard!”

Yang Ye rubbed her head tenderly, and he swore in his heart that he wouldn’t allow Little Yao to be harmed no matter what!

Su Qingshi held Little Yao’s hand. She glanced at Yang Ye before she waved her right hand, and then they vanished from Cool Breeze Gorge atop the Su Qingshi’s sword.

Yang Ye gazed at the flowing light on the horizon for a long time, and then he took a deep breath before he turned around and walked once more towards the Ironshell Tree. After that, he started to continue practicing his drawing technique again.

If he wanted to protect Little Yao from harm, then he needed a formidable strength to accomplish it. Yet now, his strength was still slightly weak. Even though his strength was already not bad below the First Heaven Realm, he was no more than an ant when compared to experts of Su Qingshi and Feng Yi’s level.

Even though this was slightly painful, it was the truth. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

So, he had to work even harder!
