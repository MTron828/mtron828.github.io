Chapter 1355 – Always Be Cautious!

The vast starry sky was studded with an array of countless stars . It was profound and enchanting. Specks of starlight descended from the sky above and covered the ground in a thin veil of crystal blue.

So the starry sky is that beautiful!

Countless people had such thoughts.

As for some Voiders, it wasn’t just pure curiosity and excitement that they felt, they felt overjoyed and relieved as well. Because Dark Hell Continent was like a cage to them, a cage made specially for Voiders like them. They could never advance in their cultivation while residing on the continent, and all they could do was wait for death to arrive.

Fortunately, the restrictions were gone, so they were free.

...

Yang Ye, Blind Maiden, and Qiong Qi remained silent for a long time. In the end, Qiong Qi suddenly said, “I have to absorb the energy within that mixed blood dragon, so don’t disturb me while I’m doing that. If something happens, deal with it yourself.” As soon as he finished speaking, Qiong Qi transformed into a ray of light that entered Yang Ye’s chest.

Yang Ye felt speechless.

Meanwhile, Blind Maiden suddenly said, “Come with me!” As soon as she finished speaking, she turned around and walked off to the ground below.

Yang Ye hurriedly followed her, and he felt slightly excited. Why? Because he’d heard that she had the Stellar Sword Diagram.

It was a treasure!

As for what Jian Wuji said about relying on one’s own self and not relying on treasures to take shortcuts.... That was spoken to Jian Xu, but he’d already comprehended the Sword Domain, so what shortcut would he take?

Actually, as far as Yang Ye was concerned, treasures were a form of strength as well. Of course, he wouldn’t overly rely on them. He felt that treasures could be utilized to improve his strength, but he couldn’t rely on them. He had to manage that well, and so long as he did, the more treasures he had, the better it would be for him. However, if he failed, he would lose himself and become reliant on them instead!

So, it was all a problem of attitude!

Yang Ye followed Blind Maiden to that huge rock by the ocean that Blind Maiden frequently sat on. She waved her hand lightly, and it didn’t take long for the ocean water to suddenly recede. It receded extremely swiftly, and it only took a moment for the ocean water before them to recede over 1km away. After that, a grave covered in stones appeared before them.

Yang Ye followed her over to it. The grave was a normal size, and it had no tombstone or anything special about it. It was just made from the most ordinary rock.

Blind Maiden remained silent for a long time, and then she said, “We were childhood friends, and he was a sword cultivator just like you. At that time, all he wanted was to join Sword God’s Palace because it was the sacred grounds of all sword cultivators throughout the continent. However, his natural talent wasn’t good, so he was rejected repeatedly by Sword God’s Palace. He had no choice but to cultivate bitterly in order to join Sword God’s Palace. At that time, I was always there by his side as he cultivated. He cultivated very diligently. In the end, he succeeded at joining Sword God’s Palace, but he was merely a nominal disciple.”

Yang Ye glanced at the stone grave in silence.

Blind Maiden combed her hair that had become messy from the ocean winds, and she continued, “He said that once he became an outer court disciple, he would come for me and take me to Sword God’s Palace.”

She paused for a moment at this point, and then she continued, “Only then did I realize that he hadn’t wanted to join Sword God’s Palace for himself, and it was for my sake!”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “For you?”

She nodded slightly, “I hadn’t awakened then. Not only were my meridians blocked, my body was extremely weak to the point it was weaker than an ordinary person. The Sword God’s Palace was the stronger power on the continent, and it had countless herbs and treasures. The reason he’d worked so hard to join Sword God’s Palace was that he hoped to get medicine for me. Unfortunately, he didn’t know that no medicine could heal my body.”

Yang Ye remained silent.

Blind Maiden continued, “He worked hard and succeeded in becoming an outer court disciple. Because of the willpower and diligence he showed, an elder of Sword God’s Palace took a liking to him, and that elder accepted him as his disciple. Moreover, that elder agreed to help heal me. However, at the same time, Jian Xu colluded with that demonic dragon to launch a surprise attack on Sword God’s Palace.

Blind Maiden paused for a moment at this point, and then she continued, “Because Jian Xu knew everything about Sword God’s Palace’s formation and strength, all the experts of Sword God’s Palace were slaughtered by their joint forces. That included him....”

When she spoke up to this point, Yang Ye noticed that 2 beads of tears seeped out from the corners of Blind Maiden’s eyes, and they were blood red!

A long moment of silence passed before the beads of blood red tears vanished into thin air, “The breeze here is quite strong.” As soon as she finished speaking, she waved her hand lightly, and the ocean breeze in the surroundings couldn’t get close to her or Yang Ye anymore.

Yang Ye remained silent.

Blind Maiden continued, “From the moment I knew he was gone, my tears never stopped. In the end, I became blind, and then I awakened. There are 2 things in my life that I regret the most. The first is being unable to help my big sister and second sister all those years ago, and the 2nd thing is not going blind earlier. He wouldn’t have died if I went blind earlier.”

Yang Ye shook his head. Needless to say, the demonic dragon and Jian Xu definitely felt extremely aggrieved. Because they’d merely killed someone they regarded as an ant, and then Blind Maiden trapped them here for thousands of years before they finally died.... But all of this had only been because they’d killed an insignificant outer court disciple.

There were risks when one killed another, so one had to be cautious at all times!

“I trapped the dragon, but Jian Xu escaped. However, I knew that he would be back because I took the Stellar Sword Diagram.” Meanwhile, Blind Maiden added, “As I expected, he returned once that demonic dragon had fully recuperated. Actually, I could have killed that dragon a very long time ago. However, Jian Xu would definitely go completely into hiding if I had killed that dragon. For the sake of killing them, I had no choice but to wait until that demonic dragon recovered completely!”

“Actually, you would have been able to kill them even if I and Qiong Qi weren’t here, right?” asked Yang Ye. Based on how she fought earlier, he knew that she had definitely not used her full strength.

Blind Maiden fell silent for a short while and said, “Your arrival surprised me slightly.”

Yang Ye replied, ‘You’ve helped me so many times, and you’re Nether Maiden’s third sister. So, how could I possibly stand by idly and do nothing?”

Blind Maiden turned to look at Yang Ye. Even though her eyes were closed, Yang Ye could sense that she was looking at him. A long time passed before she nodded slightly and said, “There’s a Ling in my name. You can call me Big Sister Ling.” If she’d helped him before out of consideration for Nether Maiden and the others, then now she’d truly acknowledged Yang Ye and treated him like a younger brother.

Yang Ye was slightly stunned, and then he smiled, “Big Sister Ling!” He didn’t lose anything from calling her big sister, and he should be said to have gained instead.... After all, she was an extraordinary expert! Moreover, she was Nether Maiden’s third sister. He’d gone through life and death with Nether Maiden, so he should address Blind Maiden as big sister.

Blind Maiden nodded slightly, and then she turned around and walked over to the grave. A long time of silence ensued before she spoke softly, “I’m leaving. Once I’m done with what I need to do, I’ll come here and accompany you until the end of time.”

As soon as she finished speaking, she walked over to Yang Ye, grabbed his shoulder, and shot up into the sky.

Once they left, the ocean water instantly filled up the area, and the grave was instantly submerged below the water.

High above in the sky.

Blind Maiden said, “I’m leaving.”

Yang Ye asked, “Where are you going?”

She replied, “To a place I should have gone to a long time ago.”

Yang Ye remained silent for a while, and then he said, “Do you know where Clouds of Heaven Stellar Region is?” It was the stellar region that Lady was from, but he knew nothing about it. However, he knew that Blind Maiden possessed extensive knowledge and should know where it was.

“Clouds of Heaven!” Blind Maiden asked, “You’re going there?” Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Yang Ye nodded.

Blind Maiden explained, “If you want to head there or the Radiant Dimension, you must first go to a place.”

Yang Ye hurriedly asked, “What place?”

She replied, “Stellar City!”

“Stellar City?” Yang Ye was puzzled, “Is it a world/”

Blind Maiden explained, “It’s a city, but can also be called a world. Because only that city exists in that world. There are many stellar teleportation formations within the city, and you can teleport to any other stellar region besides the large world. Stellar City was created by a clan in the large world, and it’s focused on providing services to the medium and small worlds. Of course, there’s a fee to utilize them!”

Yang Ye asked, “How do I get there?”

Blind Maiden looked up at the sky and said, “There’s a stellar teleportation formation in every stellar region, and there’s one here as well. So, once you leave Dark Hell Continent, continue north through space and you’ll find one. Enter it and you’ll arrive at Stellar City.”

Yang Ye nodded, “Understood.”

Meanwhile, Blind Maiden added, “You’re too headstrong, firm, and rash. This character of yours is bound to bring endless troubles to you. However, it’s that character of yours which allowed you to possess your current accomplishments. You should realize that there’s no way back for you, and you can only advance courageously and ceaselessly strengthen yourself. Only then can you act according to your will and stay true to your heart. Understand?”

Yang Ye nodded. He naturally understood Nether Maiden. He’d offended countless people because of his character, and it had brought him all sorts of trouble. But he couldn’t change his character.

He, Yang Ye, was really unable to accept injustice to himself so that others would be happy!

As far as he was concerned, if anyone bullied him, then he would repay that person tenfold.

He repaid his debts and took revenge on the enmity he had!

It was the principle he lived by, and it was his character!

Blind Maiden looked down at where the grave was below the ocean, and she gazed at that spot for a long time before she said, “Wait for me!”

As soon as she finished speaking, she transformed into a beam of light that shot up into the sky and charged towards the starry sky beyond it.

Yang Ye was stunned, and then he hurriedly said, “The Stellar....”

He hadn’t even finished speaking when a ray of white light suddenly shot down from the starry sky above him. It was extremely swift and instantly arrived before him.

Yang Ye was instantly stunned when the white light dispersed.
