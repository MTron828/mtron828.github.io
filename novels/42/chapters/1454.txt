Chapter 1455 – Undying Elemental Body!

Boom!

At the moment its mouth shot towards Yang Ye, a wave of mysterious energy had descended from the sky and slammed against it.

The python was caught off guard, and its head was instantly slammed against the ground. However, the energy didn’t vanish, and it descended constantly from the sky and slammed against the python.

It didn’t take long for shrill and miserable cries to resound.

It was absolutely miserable.

The Celestial Demon Wolves shook their heads. Eaglet had courted death before this, and now the python was doing the same. Fortunately, they hadn’t acted like this that day. So, the pain they suffered was much milder than the python or Eaglet.

The python was enormous. Because the mysterious energy was suppressing, its body had curled up completely and was trembling violently.

Yang Ye sat cross-legged in midair in silence, and just gazed at it.

The mysterious expert was right. The python was extremely vicious. Ordinary methods were useless against such ancient demon beasts, and the only way was to beat them up until they yielded.

The Ancient Emperor Python’s howl grew weaker and weaker. In the end, it couldn’t even make a sound.

But Yang Ye still didn’t say a word, and the energy was still descending.

After quite some time passed, the python wasn’t moving at all. It wasn’t dead, and it just didn’t even have the strength to twitch.

The Celestial Demon Wolves couldn’t really bear to watch this any longer. But they didn’t say anything.

Because it was that fellow’s fault for trying to eat Yang Ye!

Around 15 minutes later, Yang Ye waved his hand. The Primordial Pagoda was very nice to him, and the mysterious energy had vanished in an instant. Yang Ye flew over to the python’s head. He gazed at the python which was extremely weak and on the verge of death, “One last chance. Will you submit or die?”

It didn’t take long for the python to open its eyes, and it just gazed at Yang Ye.

Yang Ye gazed at it for a long time, and then he nodded, “I admire your unyielding spirit. Since you’ve chosen death, then I’ll fulfil your wish!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he turned around and gazed at the demon wolves, “Let’s go!”

They glanced at Yang Ye, and then nodded and left the Primordial Pagoda. Once they left, Yang Ye’s clone vanished as well.

Only the python remained here.

The Primordial Pagoda didn’t act against the python. However, when it recovered slightly, the mysterious energy would appear once more.

Just like that, the python would recover slightly, the energy would appear, and then it would be struck back to its previous state.

...

Meanwhile, in the outside world. Yang Ye opened his eyes, glanced at the surroundings, and said, “Let’s go!”

Yang Ye would naturally not waste his time on the python. Since it was so unyielding, he just left the Primordial Pagoda to play with it. In any case, it couldn’t escape now, so he had all the time in the world to subdue it. It only had two choices, and it was to either surrender to him or kill itself. Yang Ye didn’t think that it would kill itself. After all, it had lived for so many years and been imprisoned for so many years. Now that it finally has a chance at freedom, how could it possibly take its own life?

If it wanted to take its own life, it would have done so when it was imprisoned!

Since it still hadn’t done that until now, it clearly didn’t want to die.

Since it didn’t want to die, then it was much easier to deal with. The Primordial Pagoda was there to deal with it. In any case, he wasn’t in a rush.

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts, glanced at the surroundings, and then looked towards the mountain wall in the distance. Even though there was no path ahead, he could make one.

Yang Ye had no further worries here, so he immediately made the demon wolves and Eaglet return to the Primordial Pagoda, and then he transformed into a ray of light that shot into the mountain wall.

Monkey Mountain’s size had truly exceeded Yang Ye’s expectations. He flew almost an hour through the mountain yet was still unable to get through to the other side!

Fortunately, he didn’t encounter any further danger. Obviously, the mountain was the Ancient Emperor Python’s territory and ordinary demon beasts would dare not enter the mountain. So, he didn’t encounter any trouble all along the way.

After traveling for around four hours, Yang Ye finally emerged from within Monkey Mountain.

At this moment, he felt really lucky that he hadn’t chosen to go around it. If he had, then he wouldn’t have been able to go around it even after traveling for two days and two nights.

Yang Ye looked up, and the area before him was still filled with miasma. But at this moment, because it was noon, the miasma wasn’t that thick.

Yang Ye turned to glance at the mountain behind him. Actually, he was quite curious about the mountain. If his strength was sufficient, he really wanted to climb it and have a look. However, his strength was clearly insufficient. So, he could only think about doing it.

He withdrew his gaze, turned around, and looked off into the distance before vanishing into the miasma.

Big Blackie and the others didn’t know the Forest of Darkness’ exact location, and they only knew a rough direction towards it. Presently, Yang Ye was going in that direction. Even though he might not get to the Forest of Darkness like this, he had no choice. He knew nothing about this place, so he could only go forward. He wanted to look for a person or beast to get directions from. Unfortunately, there was nothing here.

Moreover, if he really did meet a person or beast, then he had to be careful.

Even though it was noon, sunlight couldn’t pass through the miasma, and he could only see a weak bit of light coming through the miasma.

Crack!

Suddenly, a clear and resounding crack resounded from beneath Yang Ye’s foot. Yang Ye stopped and looked down, and he saw a skeleton beneath his feet.

A human skeleton!

Someone had been here!

Yang Ye remained silent for an instant, and then he twisted his palms and shook them lightly. In an instant, a wave of aura appeared out of thin air around him, and then the miasma in his vicinity was instantly pushed far away. Once the miasma was pushed away and he saw the scene around him, Yang Ye immediately frowned.

There were over a dozen human skeletons in the surroundings. Besides that, there were some other skeletons that were strangely shaped. Based on their outer appearance, they belonged to demon beasts.

Obviously, a battle had occurred here, and then both sides had perished.

Yang Ye’s gaze descended onto the human skeletons. Who are they? They were actually able to get here.

It could be said that if he didn’t have Qiong Qi’s help, then it would have been practically impossible for him to get here. But they had been able to get here. So, he could imagine how strong they had been!

But they’d actually died here.

Yang Ye’s gaze descended onto the skeletons of demon beasts. Based on those skeletons, it was impossible to discern what demon beasts they had been. However, they weren’t very large or should be called very small. They were the size of a normal human!

Suddenly, Yang Ye’s expression changed, and he moved around 1km back. At the same time, he became extremely vigilant. It didn’t take long for one of the human skeletons to start moving, and then a middle aged man appeared above it. The middle aged man’s figure was ethereal. Obviously, it was just a strand of the soul.

“I thought I wouldn’t be able to see another human.” The middle aged man gazed at Yang Ye, “I never expected someone to get here after so many years. Moreover, it’s even a Voider. A Voider.... How unbelievable.”

Yang Ye asked, “Senior, may I know who you are?”

The middle aged man shook his head, “It’s meaningless. Help me do something, alright?”

Yang Ye glanced at the middle aged man and said, “Please do tell me about it.”

The middle aged man looked down at the skeletons in the surroundings and said, “If you can get out of here, then take our skeletons with you and bury them.” He paused for a moment and continued, “Take the skeletons of those demon beasts with you as well. They are all pitiable demon beasts.” Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Pitiable?”

The middle aged man replied, “They are imprisoned for eternity. Even if they die, they can’t enter the cycle of rebirth. Don’t you think they are pitiable?”

Yang Ye asked, “Senior, you know about the Ominous Territory’s origins?”

“I know a little!” The middle aged man continued, “I know that you want to know as well. However, it’s of no benefit to you. You are still too weak, and you’ll die if you find out about some things.”

Yang Ye fell silent. Actually, calling him weak wasn’t wrong. Obviously, the middle aged man’s past strength was definitely not something he could compare to.

Meanwhile, the middle aged man suddenly flicked a scroll over to Yang Ye, “My strongest technique. It should be very helpful to you. Take it as a form of my gratitude!”

Yang Ye would naturally not refuse it, and he immediately took it and said, “Senior, you said that it’s impossible to enter the cycle of rebirth here. What did you mean by that?”

The middle aged man fell silent for a long time, and then he said, “There’s a mysterious force here. Anyone who dies here, including demon beasts, aren’t able to ever enter the cycle of rebirth. Rebirth is something you’re still unable to come into contact with because you’re quite weak now. Once you understand what rebirth is, you’ll understand what it represents to cultivators like us.”

Rebirth? Yang Ye intended to say something, but the middle aged man shook his head, “I don’t have more time. I’ve been dead for too long. It’s a miracle that this strand of my soul has been able to remain until now. I can’t answer more questions for you.”

As he spoke, he flicked a palm-sized golden dragon seal to Yang Ye. Yang Ye was about to ask when the seal instantly entered the center of his forehead.

Yang Ye gazed at the middle aged man, “What’s that?”

“A token of identity!” The middle aged man continued, “If you get to a kingdom called Dark Moon Kingdom in the future, then give it to the emperor of that kingdom if you think he isn’t bad. If you think he’s useless, then use it to remove him from the throne and choose someone you think isn’t bad from amongst the imperial family. Let that person take control of the kingdom instead. As compensation, you can cultivate the Undying Elemental Body technique contained within the seal.”

Dark Moon Kingdom? Undying Elemental Body? Who is he? How did he get here? Yang Ye was quite stunned, and he had too many questions.

He was about to ask about them when the middle aged man suddenly said, “That person behind you. She....”

“Behind me?” Yang Ye was stunned, and then a chill ran down his spine, “You can see her? You’re actually able to see her?”

The middle aged man was stunned as well when he heard Yang Ye, and then he said, “You.... She....”

The middle aged man hadn’t even been able to finish speaking when a gust of wind swept by, and then the middle aged man vanished.
