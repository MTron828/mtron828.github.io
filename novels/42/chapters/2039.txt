Chapter 2040 – Are You Afraid?

Thud!

The head slammed against the ground and exploded into pieces.

In an instant, the surroundings fell extremely silent.

The others in front of Yang Ye had turned quite pale. They hadn’t expected Yang Ye to be so terrifying. Not only had he killed Li Zhen in a short while, even an elder of their Prediction Line had been killed in an instant!

That elder was a Zen Realm expert!

He'd instantly killed a Zen Realm expert!

However, that wasn’t the end of it. Yang Ye suddenly vanished on the spot.

Their expressions changed drastically at the sight of this. They didn’t counterattack, and they just turned around and instantly fled out of Gracious Mountain.

Yang Ye was stunned for a moment, and then he shook his head and left.

He didn’t chase them because it was a waste of time.

After Yang Ye left, the old man appeared here again. He glanced at the corpses on the ground, and then he shook his head and followed Yang Ye.

Gracious Hall.

As soon as the old man entered Gracious Hall, Yang Ye’s voice resounded, “Senior, what’s your name?”

The old man glanced at Yang Ye and said, “I dare not allow you to call me senior. Just call me Elder Yuan!”

Yang Ye nodded, “Elder Yuan, I want to meet that Young Martial Uncle.”

Elder Yuan said, “It isn’t that he refuses to meet you, he’s just not in the Weapon Dimension right now. But don’t worry, he left a warning before leaving. If anyone here dares to bully you, then he’ll do the same once he returns, and he’ll annihilate all the geniuses of that line. So, you don’t have to worry about those old fellows acting against you!”

Yang Ye shook his head, “I’m not worried about that. I just want to know what his goal is. I don’t think he just wants to rebuild the Slaughter Line, right?”

The old man fell silent.

Yang Ye stood up, “If you meet him, tell him that since I owe him, I’ll naturally repay him. But I don’t like being used.”

Elder Yuan nodded, “I understand!” He paused for a moment and continued, “I don’t really understand something. Why did you act so ruthlessly?”

Ruthlessly!

Yang Ye’s actions were undoubtedly extremely ruthless!

Yang Ye replied indifferently, “Since I came into contact with the Weapon Path, I knew that many don’t want the Slaughter Line to rise one more. They include those people from before. If I gave them a chance after they came here, do you think they would let me live? Even if they did, it would probably be worse than death!”

Yang Ye shook his head and smiled, “Since they want to kill me, why can’t I kill them? As for being ruthless… Elder Yuan, allow me to be honest. If the Slaughter Line was ruthless enough all those years ago, it probably wouldn’t have suffered annihilation!”

Elder Yuan’s face instantly turned quite gloomy. Obviously, Yang Ye had hit a soft spot for him. However, it didn’t take long for his expression to return to normal. A long time passed before he gazed at Yang Ye, “You’re absolutely correct. If the last Seal Master was even half as ruthless as you are, then the Slaughter Line wouldn’t have fallen to such a state!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he turned around and left. His figure seemed quite dejected.

Yang Ye glanced at Elder Yuan, withdrew his gaze, and entered the Primordial Pagoda.

As soon as he arrived in the pagoda, Snowy and Tian Xiu appeared in front of him, and each of them was holding a steamed bun. Snowy hurriedly offered her steamed bun to Yang Ye.

Yang Ye glanced at it. There was a small hole in the corner of it. Obviously, Snowy had taken that bite.

Yang Ye smiled, rubbed her head, and said, “You have it!”

Snowy didn’t hold back and started nibbling.

Yang Ye gazed at Tian Xiu, and she stretched out her hand. There was a bun on her palm.

Yang Ye smiled, “Both of you enjoy. I’m going to do some things!”

Yang Ye vanished on the spot once he finished speaking.

Snowy blinked, and then she gazed at Tian Xiu. The latter spoke softly, “Snowy, let’s go play!”

Snowy’s eyes lit up, and she hurriedly nodded.

…

At the 2nd floor of the Primordial Pagoda, Yang Ye went to the Divine Yin Flame.

The Divine Yin Flame asked, “You want to ask me about that little girl?”

Yang Ye nodded. Tian Xiu was definitely not ordinary. As far as he was concerned, the Divine Yin Flame should know something.

The Divine Yin Flame fell silent for a long time before he said, “That little girl was able to make the spirit of the pagoda display goodwill, so her background is something even I am very curious about.”

Yang Ye frowned, “Senior, even you don’t know?”

The Divine Yin Flame replied, “Let me ask you something, how was the universe formed?”

Yang Ye was speechless. How would he know the answer to that?

The Divine Yin Flame said, “Before the human race and all the other races, it was the god race. They are a race that existed for a very long time, and they existed before the human race and the other races. However, do you know what came before the god race? Another civilization definitely existed before the god race, and I’m sure of that.” UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Yang Ye spoke in a low voice, “Senior, what are you trying to say?”

The Divine Yin Flame said, “She isn’t ordinary. I’ve taken a look at her physique, and it doesn’t seem like the physique of any known race. Especially her soul, her soul is so pure that it’s simply at a terrifying level. Moreover, her cells are very different from humans!”

When he spoke up to this point, the Divine Yin Flame paused for a moment and continued, “In the beginning, the pagoda’s spirit was hostile towards her, and it was because it sensed danger from her. There really aren’t many people in this world that can make the pagoda sense danger. Even that evil treasure can’t make the pagoda feel threatened, let alone make the pagoda’s spirit show goodwill!”

Yang Ye fell silent. He knew the pagoda’s temper well. It was an absolutely proud fellow, but Tian Xiu had made the pagoda show goodwill to her. So, what did that represent?”

Just thinking about it was terrifying!

“Actually, you don’t have to worry!” The Divine Yin Flame explained, “She doesn’t seem to be a bad person. So, getting to know her and forming goodwill with her isn’t a bad thing for you. Moreover, it’s a good thing.”

Yang Ye smiled, “I didn’t think so much about it. I only saved her because I wanted to help. I never expected her background to be so mysterious and great!”

The Divine Yin Flame said, “You have a sincere heart, and you never care about benefits. You just care about following your heart! It can be said that your heart played a huge role in your ability to attain such a level in your Sword Dao.”

Yang Ye grinned and was about to speak when the Divine Yin Flame said, “However, there’s a disadvantage too. It’s easy for you to offend others and create enmity. However, it’s normal. Nothing has ever been perfect in the world!”

Yang Ye took a deep breath and said, “All of that isn’t something I should be thinking about. I should be thinking about how to survive! The true danger has only just begun!”

Meanwhile, the Divine Yin Flame suddenly said, “Don’t forget that there’s the Dao Path too!”

The Dao Path!

Yang Ye laughed bitterly and left the 2nd floor.

Cultivate!

After he went to the 3rd floor, Yang Ye sat down cross-legged and started meditating.

A long time passed before his aura calmed down, and then he opened his eyes. He flipped his right palm, and two pure white pearls appeared before him.

Inner cores!

The inner cores of two demon kings!

Yang Ye swallowed one of them. As soon as it entered him, a torrent of surging spirit energy swept through his body. Yang Ye’s body instantly started absorbing it madly, and as more and more was absorbed, Yang Ye’s aura gradually started to change. It wasn’t just his aura that was changing, even his body was silently being changed.

The inner core of a demon king was the essence of a demon king that was condensed throughout the demon king’s lifetime, and the energy within it was simply immeasurable. So, Yang Ye was caught off guard by it and had almost failed to endure the impact from it. Fortunately, he hadn’t been overconfident and had merely consumed one of them.

Time trickled by. The space around Yang Ye started to tremble slightly, and Yang Ye’s body started to tremble as well. However, it was very mild, and it was almost unnoticeable if one didn’t look carefully.

Time flowed by quickly. In the blink of an eye, half a month had passed.

Suddenly, Yang Ye opened his eyes and stood up.

Bang!

The space around him shook.

Yang Ye took a deep breath and stepped forward.

Boom!

The space around him trembled!

Yang Ye was stunned.

An instant later, Yang Ye casually waved his hand, and the space there warped before him.

Yang Ye was utterly stunned by the sight of this, but it didn’t take long for delight to appear on his face.

Strength!

His strength had increased tremendously!

It was so strong that he couldn’t control it properly. Of course, that was only temporary.

Yang Ye glanced at his fist, and he couldn’t help but smile. Based on his current physical strength, he was entirely capable of posing a huge threat to a Zen Realm expert. Even if he didn’t use his sword and used his fist, he could kill a Zen Realm expert!

Besides that, he’d scanned his body, and based on its current state, if he used the Sky Dragon as well, then an ordinary Zen Realm expert would probably be unable to kill him even if he just stood still.

Yang Ye glanced at the other inner core in his grasp, but he didn’t consume it. Because if he did, its effects wouldn’t be that great anymore. His body was at a bottleneck!

So, consuming it would be quite a waste!

After that, Yang Ye started getting used to his new strength.

Three days later, Yang Ye suddenly left the Primordial Pagoda.

Yang Ye walked out of the hall, and Elder Yuan was there. Elder Yuan flicked a golden card to Yang Ye, “The Guardian Line sent this invitation to participate in a gathering of theirs.”

He paused for a moment and added, “I suggest that you attend!”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Why?”

The old man looked Yang Ye in the eyes, “Since you’re chosen to make a show of strength, then don’t stop doing it!”

Yang Ye spoke solemnly, “I’m sure you’re aware that something bad will definitely occur if I go.”

The old man looked Yang Ye in the eyes, “Are you afraid?”

Yang Ye refused to show any weakness and met the old man’s gaze, “I’m afraid I’ll annihilate all the geniuses of the Weapon Path. Once I go berserk, I even try to kill myself!”
