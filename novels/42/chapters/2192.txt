Chapter 2193 – Kill Them All!

The feeling of being invincible!

Ding Shaoyao’s eyes narrowed slightly while an extremely solemn expression appeared on her face.

She’d seen the middle aged man in the past, and he was the most mysterious and unfathomable existence she’d met.

At this moment, the middle aged man walked over to the golden pillar of energy and tapped his finger forward.

Hiss!

The golden pillar of energy instantly exploded apart and transformed into fragments that rained down from the sky.

A middle aged man in a violet robe was within the pillar of light. His hair hung down loosely to his shoulders, his figure was robust, and there was a dignified expression on his face.

He was the god race’s Shi Tian.

At this moment, Shi Tian was looking at the middle aged man too.

Shi Tian walked slowly to the middle aged man, and then he tapped his finger at the middle aged man.

The heavens and the earth seemed to fall to deathly silence before this movement.

The world dimmed down!

Meanwhile, a sword howl resounded.

Hiss!

At this moment, a ray of sword energy sliced through the world, and then Shi Tian was pushed over 30km back.

Meanwhile, the middle aged man in cloud white robes had turned around and started walking away.

Stopping before someone got hurt?

Not at all!

The middle aged man didn’t have the desire to continue fighting. Because Shi Tian wasn’t at his peak.

“Who are you?” Suddenly, Shi Tian spoke in a low voice. His right hand was behind his back, and if someone was behind him, that person would notice that an extremely deep injury was on that arm.

The middle aged man didn’t say a single word.

“Senior!” Suddenly, Ding Shaoyao appeared before the middle aged man.

The middle aged man glanced at her, and she spoke solemnly, “The large universe is in danger right now, and you’re so strong. So please…”

“What does that have to do with me?” The middle aged man looked her in the eyes, “Your natural talent isn’t bad. Unfortunately, you just love to play with that thing called strategy. Little girl, all strategy is useless before absolute strength.”

Ding Shaoyao felt quite uncomfortable, “That’s not necessarily the case?”

“It isn’t?” The man grinned, “If I wanted to annihilate your god race right now, it would only take a moment. So, tell me, how would you stop me?”

Ding Shaoyao’s expression changed.

The middle aged man shook his head. He was about to leave when Ding Shaoyao suddenly asked, “Senior, what do you think about Yang Ye? He’s called the number one sword cultivator in the large universe right now, but you seem to use the sword too!”

Yang Ye!

The middle aged man stopped, fell silent for a long time, and then he spoke softly, “His Sword Dao is a little complicated. Both his Slaughter Dao and Sword Dao aren’t pure enough. His Slaughter Dao isn’t pure enough because emotions still remain in his heart, and he cannot be ruthless. His Sword Dao isn’t pure enough because he has slaughter intent in his heart. Both his Slaughter Dao and Sword Dao’s source of power comes from emotions. If he can stay true to his heart and never lose sight of that, then he will have his own Dao.”

Ding Shaoyao glanced at the middle aged man and said, “Senior, your Sword Dao seems to be the exact opposite of that!”

The middle aged man glanced at Ding Shaoyao with deep meaning in his eyes, “You are very smart.”

The middle aged man didn’t say another word and just vanished into the distance.

Ding Shaoyao closed her eyes slowly, “It should be as I think!”

A long time passed before Ding Shaoyao turned around and went over to Shi Tian. Meanwhile, Shi Tian asked, “You’re Seer’s daughter?”

She nodded.

A gentle expression flashed through his eyes, “Your Ding Clan has sacrificed too much for my god race. If it wasn’t for your father’s sacrifice, my god race would have been annihilated in that battle!”

Ding Shaoyao remained silent.

Shi Tian closed his eyes slowly, “It’s fine, I’ll make all of them pay a thousandfold for what they’ve done!”

Meanwhile, Ding Shaoyao suddenly said, “I want to take a rest!”

“Huh?” Shi Tian gazed at her, and she spoke softly, “Lord Shi Tian, since you’ve been revived, I’ll leave the god race to you. I-I want to live some time in peace. Please allow me to do so!”

Shi Tian gazed at her for a long time and said, “Alright, but remember that the god race’s door and the position of strategist is always open to you!”

Ding Shaoyao nodded, and then she released Snowy and said, “There’s one more thing. This Sprite Lord can do many things for our god race, and she helped me on many occasions in the past, so I hope you’ll take good care of her.”

Shi Tian glanced at Snowy and nodded, “Alright!”

Ding Shaoyao bowed slightly and gazed at Snowy. She spoke softly, “Be obedient. You can’t be so willful as you’ve been in the past.”

Snowy glared angrily at her and started waving her claws.

Yang Ye!

Yang Ye will come!

That was what Snowy was telling her.

Ding Shaoyao grinned and left without saying a word.

She arrived at a deathly silent place. It was the former capital of the god race, yet now, it was filled with deathly silence. It was without spirit energy or any signs of life.

Deathly silent!

Everyone here was dead.

Ding Shaoyao knelt down slowly while two streams of tears seeped out from her eyes without end, “Father, I don’t want to kill him, and I don’t want to harm him. But the other races slaughtered 370 of our cities, killed billions of our people, and practically annihilated us. I have to avenge it. They can’t be allowed to die for nothing. My Ding Clan’s 1,600 people’s vengeful souls still remain, so I-I have no choice!”

The god race had lost in the battle against the other races.

However, very few knew how the other races had treated the ordinary people of the god race.

All 370 cities of the god race had been slaughtered!

Blood covered the large universe at that time.

The winner makes the rules. The god race lost, so that was the consequence of its loss.

A debt of blood!

A long time passed before she stood up slowly, “I’ve done everything I can for the god race… He saved my life all those years ago, so I’ll give my life back to him.”

She turned around and left.

…

In the depths of the endless black holes, there was a door of light.

Suddenly, it shook, and then a phantom walked out slowly from within it. A short while later, the phantom gradually became material. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

The phantom was shaped like a human, but was much more robust, and its pupils were gray.

It was a woman.

She wore dark gold armor, a helmet, and a dark golden spear hung on her back. There was a huge beast beneath her.

The beast was like a horse, but it was much larger than an ordinary horse. It was completely pitch black, with crimson red eyes, and a pair of wings on its back. Its wings were pitch black too and sharp like blades.

She glanced at the surroundings, and then she vanished on the spot.

…

Meanwhile, millions of kilometers away on Void Spirit Continent. Tian Xiu suddenly looked up within the Primordial Pagoda, and her eyes narrowed slightly, “The aura of death… The Undying Cavalry… They’re here!”

“The Undying Cavalry?” Yang Ye appeared by her side and rubbed her head gently, “What’s that?”

Tian Xiu lowered her head slightly, “An army, a powerful army!”

A powerful army!

Yang Ye gazed at her for a long time before he spoke softly, “A’Xiu, I’m really curious about who you are.”

She looked up at Yang Ye, “Do you really want to know?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “I don’t. All I know is that you’re A’Xiu.”

She cracked a smile that was extremely brilliant when she heard him.

A short while later, she took his hand, “Big Brother, you want to take revenge, right?”

Yang Ye nodded, “Of course.”

Tian Xiu spoke softly, “Can you wait?”

Yang Ye gazed at her with bewilderment, “Huh?”

She explained softly, “They will suffer for their own decisions. You must work hard on improving your strength. Because people even more terrifying than them have arrived. I sensed their auras, and they’ll arrive very soon.”

Yang Ye frowned.

He had a very bad feeling!

Yang Ye fell silent for a long time. He was about to speak when Yang Lianshuang suddenly entered the Primordial Pagoda. She went over to Yang Ye and said, “Shi Tian from the god race has been revived!”

The god race’s patriarch!

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly, “What about Snowy?”

Yang Lianshuang spoke softly, “Snowy is with Shi Tian. As for Ding Shaoyao, she seems to have vanished!”

Yang Ye fell silent for a long time and said, “I understand!”

Yang Lianshuang suddenly asked, “If anything happens to Snowy, then…”

Yang Ye gazed at her, “If anything happens to Snowy, I’ll kill every member of the god race, and I’ll take every drop of their blood. All the races couldn’t annihilate them, so I’ll do it instead!”

Snowy was his reverse scale.

Anyone who touched Snowy deserved to die!

Yang Lianshuang sighed softly and didn’t say another word.

“I’m heading out. I’ll leave the rest to you!” Yang Ye transformed into a ray of blood red light and vanished.

…

The Weapon Path.

A middle aged man suddenly arrived at the entrance of the Weapon Dimension.

It was Shi Tian.

The guardian of the Weapon Dimension appeared before Shi Tian. He was about to speak when Shi Tian stretched out his hand and made a pinching motion.

Bam!

The guardian’s body exploded into bits.

Shi Tian raised his palm and slapped it down.

Bang!

The entire barrier around the Weapon Dimension was obliterated, and then Shi Tian and 26 Sages of the god race appeared within the Weapon Dimension.

Everyone here was shocked, and countless experts charged up into the sky.

Shi Tian glanced at the surroundings and ordered indifferently, “Kill them all!”
