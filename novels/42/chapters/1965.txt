Chapter 1966 – What’s There to Fear?

Yang Ye stood there while Qin Chuan and the others were behind him.

At this moment, Yang Ye’s injuries were almost fully healed by the Primordial Violet Energy.

Yang Ye glanced at them and said, “Come with me!”

Yang Ye turned around once he finished speaking, and he was facing A’Man’s direction.

Suddenly, one of them said, “Big Sis told us to return to the city!”

Yang Ye took a deep breath and replied, “If you want to return, you can go; if you want to come with me, you can come!”

Meanwhile, one of them reminded, “Dire Wolf is at the See Dao Realm!”

Yang Ye suddenly looked at that person and said, “What’s there to fear?!”

As soon as he finished speaking, a sword appeared below his feet, and then a ray of light shot into the sky.

Qin Chuan suddenly laughed viciously, “Yang Ye is right! What’s there to fear?!”

His figure shot after Yang Ye.

Mad Saber and Ling didn’t say a word because they’d vanished on the spot.

“What’s there to fear!”

“What’s there to fear…”

Furious shouts resounded through the sky, and then they shot off into the sky.

…

Dire Wolf gazed at A’Man whose aura was rising incessantly, “A’Man, you’re really an admirable woman. However, you’re insensible. Since that’s the case, you can die!”

He was about to attack once he finished speaking.

Suddenly, everyone looked up at the sky, and there were a few dozen rays of light there.

They were led by a ray of light that contained sword energy!

Dire Wolf’s eyes narrowed slightly from the sight of this.

A’Man’s face fell instead.

It didn’t take long for everyone to appear here with Yang Ye in the lead.

A’Man looked Yang Ye in the eyes, “Why?”

Why?

Yang Ye chuckled, “In my entire life, I never betray those who don’t betray me.”

He gazed at Qin Chuan and the others, “Dire Wolf is at the See Dao Realm. Are you afraid?”

Qin Chuan suddenly asked, “Are you afraid?”

Yang Ye roared with laughter and gazed at Dire Wolf, “I’ve never known fear in my lifetime. Brothers! Kill one and you break even, kill two and you’ve made a profit! Let’s fight them!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye transformed into a ray of light that shot towards Dire Wolf.

A 2nd stage Enlightened Realm expert against a See Dao Realm expert!

It didn’t matter if he could defeat Dire Wolf or not, what mattered was that he dared to attack Dire Wolf!

Just this moment made his status, in the hearts of everyone from Sky Residence City, undergo a change.

Dire Wolf’s face turned gloomy, “You’re courting death!”

He casually slapped his palm forward as he spoke.

Just that caused Yang Ye to feel a wave of pressure slam down towards him! Yang Ye didn’t dare act carelessly, and he immediately activated his Sword Domain.

With the Sword Domain to help him suppress it, Dire Wolf’s aura was instantly suppressed.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye arrived before Dire Wolf.

Yang Ye drew his sword swiftly and swung it!

Heavenrend!

At this moment, his Heavenrend could be overlapped 100 times!

Coupled with the Sword Domain, it was simply capable of obliterating the world!

A solemn and surprised expression appeared in Dire Wolf’s eyes when he sensed the energy within Yang Ye’s sword. It wasn’t strength that a 2nd stage True Realm expert should possess!

He stopped underestimating Yang Ye, and he stabbed his spear forward.

It instantly stabbed against the tip of Yang Ye’s sword!

Bang!

They split apart upon colliding, and they both moved backwards repeatedly. However, it didn’t take long for Dire Wolf to stop himself while Yang Ye was pushed over 10km away.

It was absolutely suppression from the gap in their realms of cultivation!

If it wasn’t for his Sword Domain, he may not have been able to resist Dire Wolf’s attack!

After all, he was a See Dao Realm expert! He was even more terrifying than Yin Hou!

But Yang Ye wasn’t fighting alone.

Once he was blasted backwards, A’Man, Ling, and Mad Saber appeared before him while Qin Chuan and the others appeared around him while facing the members of the Dire Wolves.

The atmosphere here became tense.

Meanwhile, A’Man suddenly gazed at Black Devil who’d remained silent until now, “Black Devil, even if you bow to him, you’ll only be remaining alive for the sake of living. You’re someone who achieved great things, so are you really willing to submit to another and kneel before him?”

Black Devil fell silent for a moment, and then he gazed at Dire Wolf, “My Devil Cave will deal with whatever the Dire Wolves throw at us!”

The Devil Cave had joined forces with Sky Residence City!

Dire Wolf’s face was quite unsightly. The Devil Cave could be considered to have truly allied itself with Sky Residence City. Even if the Dire Wolves could win against their joint forces, it would be a pyrrhic victory. Moreover, something unexpected might occur at any moment in this damnable place.

To fight or not to fight?

They entered into a long stalemate, and then Dire Wolf gazed at Yang Ye, “I’ll remember you!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he waved his right hand and vanished with the other members of the Dire Wolves.

He had a reason to hate Yang Ye. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

The Devil Cave hadn’t joined forces with Sky Residence City earlier, and he was happy to see A’Man’s forces leave. Because A’Man would definitely die as a consequence. Then once only the members of Devil Cave remained, it would be even easier for him to deal with them.

But he hadn’t expected Yang Ye to lead the others back here.

That changed everything!

Black Devil glanced at A’Man’s group and said, “Everything’s going to change now!”

A’Man spoke solemnly, “Black Devil, both your Devil Cave and my Sky Residence City are protected by grand formations, but do you really want to spend your life hiding and afraid of offending them?”

Black Devil spoke solemnly, “We shall until we’ve attained the See Dao Realm!”

A’Man replied, “We still have to keep our pride and dignity, don’t we?”

Black Devil glanced at her and said, “Devil Cave won’t come looking for trouble with Sky Residence City until we’ve attained the See Dao Realm. Notify me if you need me!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he vanished on the spot with the other devil men.

A’Man glanced in the direction Black Devil’s group had vanished towards, and then she gazed at Yang Ye, “How are you feeling?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “I’m fine!”

Actually, he’d been injured in his battle with Dire Wolf. Dire Wolf was too strong, so if he hadn’t relied on the Sword Domain, he wouldn’t have been able to resist even a single attack!

A'Man sized up Yang Ye and said, “I underestimated you.”

Many of the others nodded slightly to display their agreement.

They didn’t have a clear understanding of Yang Ye’s strength before this, but they did now. He was an existence who used a formation to kill around 20 devil men! Moreover, he was even an extraordinarily formidable figure who could fight a See Dao Realm expert while at the 2nd stage of the Enlightened Realm!

Of course, most importantly, Yang Ye was loyal!

Actually, most of them agreed with Yang Ye’s decision to lead them back here.

Sky Residence City was a group, and none of them wanted to be abandoned!

Yang Ye chuckled, and then he spoke seriously, “The Dire Wolves will probably not let this matter rest. Do you have any plans?”

A’Man glanced at the others and replied, “I don’t. All we can do is grow stronger, incessantly. Besides that, I want all of you to remember that our enemy, our true enemy, isn’t the Dire Wolves!”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “What do you mean?”

The others gazed at her with puzzled expressions on their faces too,

A’Man pointed at the sky, “Hell Mountain Range is over there, and there are countless powerful demon beasts in there. For some reason, they aren’t showing themselves now. But I’m certain they will soon!”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Why?”

She shook her head, “You’ll find out soon! Let’s go!”

All of them returned to Sky Residence City.

Once they got back, Yang Ye went back to his spot, sat down cross-legged, and immersed his mind into his body.

He went back to studying sword techniques!

He hadn’t fully researched all the sword techniques he got from the old man in Daoist’s robes. He had to fully comprehend them because only then could he use their essence to create his own techniques.

Actually, Yang Ye had been almost unable to endure the temptation to learn these techniques, but he forced himself to stop in the end.

It was best to cultivate what belonged to him! Just learning from others would force him on the path created by others, but while others could take that path, it may not necessarily be a path that he could take!

In the next few days, Sky Residence City gradually became calm.

As for the Dire Wolves, it was like they’d vanished into thin air and were never seen again.

Even then, A’Man still prohibited everyone from leaving the city without permission.

The Wyverns came every night, but they gradually grew in number.

As for Yang Ye, he just sat there on the ground, and no one disturbed him.

He was studying!

Since he returned to Sky Residence City, Yang Ye just studied the sword techniques every single day. Once he finished studying them, he started comparing them and locating their weaknesses. As soon as it did that, he was horrified!

Because he gradually noticed the weakness of these techniques. In the beginning, he just noticed the problems in them, but an idea suddenly struck him later on.

Mend them!

He wanted to use the strong points of other techniques to mend the weaknesses of other sword techniques!

Adopt the strong points of others to mend the weaknesses present!

Just like that, time trickled by, and a month passed.

As for in the Primordial Pagoda, almost a year had passed.

In this year, Yang Ye had completely comprehended those sword techniques. Besides that, he’d improved many of them. But this process was quite difficult. However, once he succeeded, their might was improved tremendously!

The sword!

There was something Yang Ye hadn’t noticed, and it was that while he hadn’t created his own technique yet, every swing of his sword contained the influence of countless sword techniques.
