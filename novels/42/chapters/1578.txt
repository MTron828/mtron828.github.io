Chapter 1579 - The Dualism Realm!

Translator: InVader

A solemn expression appeared in Blood Maiden’s eyes when she saw Little Sky.

The little girl before her was very mysterious!

Yang Ye pulled on Little Sky’s arm and said, “What are you laughing coldly about? She didn’t say that she intends to capture you alive. Or are you the Lord of the Heaven Dao?”

Little Sky spoke indifferently, “It’s nothing. I just wanted to laugh.”

As soon as she finished speaking, she just entered the Primordial Pagoda.

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

Meanwhile, Blood Maiden suddenly said, “Let’s go!”

Yang Ye nodded. He didn’t want to continue wasting time here.

The three of them went deep into the palace, and it didn’t take long for them to arrive at a dead end.

Yang Ye and An Nanjing gazed at Blood Maiden.

Blood Maiden waved her hand lightly. In an instant, the wall before her started moving, and it moved slowly towards opposite directions. It didn’t take long for a door to appear before them.

Blood Maiden said, “Let’s go!”

Once they entered through the door, Yang Ye felt the surroundings suddenly become blurry. At the same time, his head started feeling heavy. A long time passed before Yang Ye felt that he was back to normal.

Yang Ye opened his eyes. At this moment, they weren’t in the hall anymore. An empty area stretched out around them, and there was nothing here.

Yang Ye gazed at Blood Maiden, “What’s this?”

Blood Maiden spoke softly, “There are many types of energy in this world of ours. For example, profound energy, energy of the five elements, stellar energy, the energy of time, the energy of Yin and Yang… Eldest Sister created this place all those years ago. This place is isolated from all energy. Or it should be said that only the energy of Yin and Yang exists here. She extracted every other type of energy.”

As soon as she finished speaking, she gazed at Yang Ye, “Comprehend. You’re a Deity now, the only way to advance further is to comprehend the energy of Yin and Yang. Only by understanding the energy of Yin and Yang will you be able to step into the Dualism Realm. If it’s in the outside world, it would be very difficult to accomplish that. However, it’s much simpler here. As for how long it’ll take, it depends on your own fortune.”

Yang Ye nodded, “Understood!”

Attaining the Dualism Realm required comprehension. Just like his sword intent. If one succeeded at comprehending it, then one’s sword intent would immediately rise to a new height. It sounded quite profound, and it wasn’t easy to succeed at. Normally, it required months of constant effort to finally succeed.

Everything was very difficult in the beginning, but as one constantly completed the task a thousand or ten thousand times, one would notice that the task wasn’t that difficult. The reason it didn’t feel very difficult anymore was because one would have grasped some techniques to complete the task. Once one grasped a part of the key to something, one would notice that it was actually very easy!

Meanwhile, Blood Maiden gazed at An Nanjing, “You’re at the peak of the Deity Realm too, and you can comprehend the energy of Yin and Yang here too. Your natural talent is superior to his, so I believe that it won’t take long for you to succeed.”

An Nanjing nodded slightly, “Thank you.”

Obviously, if the powers in the outside world found out about this place, countless experts would definitely go mad trying to obtain access to this place. After all, it was no different than a shortcut to advance into the Dualism Realm!

Blood Maiden glanced at them and said, “I won’t disturb you any longer. I’ll come in ten days.” She turned around and left.

Once she left, An Nanjing immediately sat down cross-legged. Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly said, “Don’t cultivate here. Let’s head inside!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he took her hand and brought her into the 3rd level of the Primordial Pagoda.

He naturally intended to cultivate in the Primordial Pagoda. He only had ten days. Comprehend the energy of Yin and Yang, and then advance within ten days? It wasn’t realistic! It was only possible in the Primordial Pagoda. If they cultivated in the Primordial Pagoda, it represented that they had over three months of time. The more time they had, the higher their chances of advancing was!

Even though they were within the Primordial Pagoda, it didn’t affect their comprehension of the energy of Yin and Yang in the surroundings. Because Yang Ye was within that space, so they could sense the energy of Yin and Yang in the world outside.

Comprehension!

After that, both of them started comprehending the energy of Yin and Yang.

Needless to say, Yang Ye didn’t really like this method of cultivation. Simply speaking, based on his character, it was really quite painful to sit here all day and sense the energy of Yin and Yang in the world outside. So, Yang Ye started to spar with An Nanjing after a few days passed.

An Nanjing naturally had no objections to that because she’d wanted to spar with Yang Ye for a long time.

In the Primordial Pagoda.

An Nanjing held Skysplit in her grasp while a calm expression covered her face. Yang Ye was standing not too far away from her. He was holding the Sword Precursor, and it was glowing.

Both of them exchanged glances in midair, and then they vanished on the spot.

Clang!

The sound of metal colliding resounded. The space in the surroundings shook violently, and then Yang Ye and An Nanjing split apart. However, it only took a moment for them to collide once more.

They were just exchanging blows, and they didn’t utilize the intents they possessed.

An Nanjing’s instinct in combat was formidable, and Yang Ye possessed the Enlightened Sword Heart. He could extremely quickly locate An Nanjing’s flaws. However, at the instant he launched his attacks, she seemed like she knew what he would do, and she was always able to be a step ahead of him. Needless to say, Yang Ye felt quite aggrieved throughout the battle.

Xiao Yuxi was staring at them without blinking. Yang Ye and An Nanjing’s fight was definitely extremely interesting. Even though they weren’t using their true strength, it was also the reason why it was so interesting.

It was a competition of instinct!

It could be said that anyone who fought them in close quarters would suffer!

After fighting for a long time, Yang Ye started to fight shamelessly, and it was by fighting without defending himself. He’d abandoned his defenses, and as soon as he did that, the situation immediately started to turn in favor of him. Because An Nanjing had to be careful. After all, she didn’t possess a body as strong as Yang Ye’s, and it was impossible for her to fight like Yang Ye.

Around two hours later, both of them stopped.

A victor hadn’t been decided!

Actually, it was impossible to decide on a victor. Because both of them had held back during the battle, and they didn’t launch lethal strikes. Moreover, at their level of strength, deciding on a victor represented they had to decide on who lived and who died.

In the next few days, they started to comprehend the energy of Yin and Yang every single day!

In the beginning, Yang Ye was actually unable to sense anything besides air, but An Nanjing said that she sensed it.

That was the gap between them in terms of natural talent!

However, it didn’t take long for Yang Ye to sense it as well. Because he’d used the Sword Domain. As soon as the Sword Domain swept out, everything could escape his notice. However, sensing it didn’t represent that they could advance into the Dualism Realm. They had to comprehend it and fully grasp it. Only then could they advance.

Advancing from the Deity Realm to the Dualism Realm relied on comprehension. If one couldn’t comprehend the energy of Yin and Yang, then it would be impossible to advance even if one cultivated every single day!

Two months passed by, but there was no movement from Yang Ye or An Nanjing.

One day, Little Sky suddenly came to the 3rd level.

Little Sky asked, “They are still comprehending?”

Xiao Yuxi nodded.

Little Sky puckered her lips, “How boring. Unless it’s sleeping, I would never do something like sitting there every day.” Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Xiao Yuxi glanced at her and spoke softly, “Cultivating is the only way to avoid being bullied.”

“That’s true!” Little Sky spoke softly, “I should make Little Little Sky and the others cultivate too, or they’ll always be bullied by humans.”

Xiao Yuxi’s eyelids raised slightly. She naturally knew what Little Little Sky was. She fell silent for a moment, and then she said, “Eyes of the Heaven Dao can become even stronger too?”

“Of course!” Little Sky continued, “However, they don’t really like to cultivate. Sigh. It’s mainly because their intelligence hasn’t fully formed. Once they possess intelligence comparable to humans, they’ll understand how they can make themselves stronger. It requires time. Sigh. Forget it, I’m going to enjoy myself.”

She was about to leave, but she suddenly gazed at An Nanjing. At this moment, a terrifying aura had suddenly surged out from An Nanjing. But it didn’t take long for the aura to be retracted.

Xiao Yuxi asked, “The Dualism Realm?”

An Nanjing opened her eyes slowly, and then she let out a mouthful of foul air. After that, she gazed at Xiao Yuxi and nodded slightly.

The Dualism Realm! Xiao Yuxi was visibly moved. She hadn’t expected An Nanjing to advance so quickly. Her natural talent is truly heaven defying.

Little Sky suddenly walked over to An Nanjing. She sized up An Nanjing and said, “Tsk, tsk. The Martial God Physique. Your physique is amazing.”

An Nanjing glanced at Little Sky, “Who’re you?”

“Little Sky!” Little Sky chuckled, “Little like big and little, sky like the sky above.” She sized up An Nanjing while she spoke, and then she continued, “Your physique isn’t bad. However, a good physique can only be considered as a good starting point. It mainly depends on whether you work hard. I can see that you’ve worked very hard. Besides that, you’re much smarter than that stupid fellow, Yang Ye. That stupid fellow still hasn’t attained the Dualism Realm! What a failure!”

As soon as she finished speaking, she placed her hands behind her back and strolled out of the cultivation room.

An Nanjing gazed at Xiao Yuxi, “Who is she?”

Xiao Yuxi fell silent for an instant, and then she said, “A strange little girl who can summon the Eyes of the Heaven Dao to fight for her!”

An Nanjing was stunned speechless.

Time trickled by. In the blink of an eye, a month had passed, but Yang Ye still showed no signs of completing his cultivation.

Meanwhile, Blood Maiden had arrived.

An Nanjing and Xiao Yuxi left the Primordial Pagoda, and Blood Maiden was standing in front of them.

Blood Maiden asked, “Where is he?”

An Nanjing shook her head, “He isn’t done!”

Blood Maiden frowned slightly, “There’s no more time. Ten days are up.”

Xiao Yuxi suddenly asked, “Should I wake him up?”

“No!” Blood Maiden shook her head, “It’s the critical moment right now, so waking him up might cause all his efforts to be wasted.”

Xiao Yuxi spoke softly, “Then…?”

Blood Maiden glanced at Xiao Yuxi and An Nanjing, and then she said, “Yuxi, stay here with him. An Nanjing, come with me.”

Xiao Yuxi asked, “Where are you going?”

Blood Maiden’s eyes narrowed slightly, “Coiling Dragon Mountain!”

An Nanjing asked, “What about your sisters?”

“They’re on the way! We’re going first!” As soon as she finished speaking, Blood Maiden grabbed An Nanjing’s shoulder and vanished on the spot.
