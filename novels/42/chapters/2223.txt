Chapter 2224 - Samadhi Flame!

“The Primordial Axe of Creation?” Yang Ye frowned, “I don’t have that!”

The Initial said, “It’s in your pagoda!”

In the Primordial Pagoda!

Yang Ye was shocked.

He still remembered that someone had told him there was a divine treasure within the pagoda. However, he’d forgotten about it until now. Now it seemed like that divine treasure was probably the Primordial Axe of Creation!

An extraordinary weapon that surpassed the Primordial Pagoda!

“You really surprised me!” Meanwhile, the Initial spoke softly, “You actually possess so many divine treasures. But now it seems like you’ve clearly not fully utilized them, or you wouldn’t be so weak!”

So weak!

Yang Ye’s face was quite unsightly.

I’m weak?

If he were being honest, he didn’t think he was weak. Of course, he knew that he really was quite weak to the Initial because the Initial was extremely strong!

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts and said, “Then how do I unseal it?”

“Unseal it?” The Initial continued, “It’s best if you don’t. Its strength is sufficient to tear the world open. If you unseal it, then based on your current strength, just the aura it emanates unconsciously is sufficient to kill you. Not to mention you, even your Primordial Pagoda can’t resist it. Only one thing in this large universe can endure its energy. Besides that, it can destroy all things, including your Primordial Pagoda!”

Yang Ye frowned slightly, “It’s that strong?”

The Initial replied, “It is the strongest among the Demonic Artifacts!”

Yang Ye asked, “What’s the strongest amongst the Sacred Artifacts?”

The Initial replied, “You ask too much!”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

The Universe Sprite glanced at Yang Ye, and then she gazed at the Initial, “Is the Demonic Artifact beneath this city dangerous?”

“Of course!” The Initial continued, “While it can’t compare to the Primordial Axe of Creation, it’s still a natural divine treasure. However, I think that you should give it a try. Don’t you think so too? If you can obtain it, your strength will be improved tremendously, and you’ll have a better chance against the undying race.”

Yang Ye asked, “What do you think about the undying race?”

The Initial fell silent for a short while and said, “What are you trying to say?”

Yang Ye replied, “If we lose, the undying race will definitely come for all of you. I’m quite curious about your thoughts on them. They are very difficult to kill after all.”

The Initial replied, “As you’ve said, they are difficult to kill, so it means they aren’t impossible to kill, right?”

Yang Ye grinned and didn’t say another word.

“Young man!” Meanwhile, the Initial suddenly said, “The universe is huge, very huge. It’s beyond your imagination. The undying race isn’t the only race in this endless universe, and neither is my initial race. The supreme experts of our large universe may not be a supreme expert but just a slightly strong person in another universe. There’s always someone stronger. These words are the truth.”

Yang Ye nodded slightly, “Thank you for the reminder.”

Meanwhile, the Initial gazed at the Universe Sprite, “Universe Sprite, you’re the spirit of the large universe. This calamity is an absolute calamity for you, but since you’ve formed your own intelligence, you can survive anywhere. If you go to a universe that is without a sprite of its own, you can rule over it. It truly isn’t necessary to perish with this large universe. Allow me to be honest, even if you can stop the undying race, now that so many years have passed and the spirit energy here has been extracted, it’s on the verge of death. So, look for somewhere else. That’s all I can say. Good luck, and may fate bring us together again!”

The Initial’s figure gradually turned ethereal upon finishing, and it didn’t take long for the figure to vanish completely.

The Universe Sprite spoke softly, “Let’s head down there to have a look!”

Yang Ye nodded.

It didn’t take long for them to get underground, and they continued down for a long time before Yang Ye suddenly frowned.

Meanwhile, the Universe Sprite said, “Something’s off!”

Yang Ye nodded, glanced at the surroundings, and said, “Be careful!”

They continued down.

Around two hours later, Yang Ye stopped.

There was a completely different world down here.

At this moment, a boundless wasteland was before them. It was red, completely barren, and cracked apart.

Both of them had vigilance on their faces.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye walked as he said, “The initial race doesn’t seem to fear the undying race!”

The Universe Sprite asked, “Why should they?”

Yang Ye replied, “I met another Initial in the past, and that Initial said they’d fought the undying race in the past.”

The Universe Sprite said, “If you want to make them fight and reap the rewards, then you’re dreaming. The initial race has left the large universe, so there’s no conflict between them and the undying race. Conversely, they are the ones who will reap the benefits now. I think that’s why that Initial was willing to tell us about the Demonic Artifact below the city. It’s because they want you to fight the undying race to the death. Don’t you think so too?”

Yang Ye smiled, “You seem to have figured everything out!”

“Let’s go!” The Universe Sprite sped up.

Yang Ye sped up too.

Around an hour later, Yang Ye and the Universe Sprite stopped.

There were four pitch black chains in the air around 1km away from them. Its top end was fixed in position in midair, and there seemed to be something chained by it while the other end was stuck to the ground. Its ends were impossible to find.

Meanwhile, the Universe Sprite suddenly grabbed Yang Ye’s shoulder and shot backward, “Watch out!

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!

As soon as they moved away, rays of light suddenly appeared there, and they surged incessantly like arcs of lightning.

“A formation!” The Universe Sprite spoke solemnly, “It’s an extremely powerful formation.”

As she spoke, she gazed at the top of the chains, “The seal is over there.”

However, there was nothing there.

Yang Ye spoke solemnly, “What’s sealed there?”

The Universe Sprite shook her head slightly, “I can’t sense it!”

Meanwhile, Yang Ye flicked a ray of sword energy over there.

But it just passed through the area.

Nothing appeared there!

Yang Ye frowned, “There’s nothing there? That’s impossible. The formation is still here, so it should be there!”

Yang Ye took a step forward once he finished speaking.

The Sword Domain!

The Sword Domain enveloped the surroundings, but Yang Ye still didn’t sense anything!

It was empty! Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Yang Ye muttered, “Impossible…”

The Universe Sprite said, ‘There’s something strange about this!”

Yang Ye nodded because he felt that it was very unusual too!

Suddenly, the formation before them trembled, and then…

Poof!

A thumb-sized flame appeared at the top of the chains.

It was tiny and quite translucent, and it just floated there quietly.

The surroundings were silent!

Suddenly, the Primordial Pagoda started to send Yang Ye a warning.

Danger!

A warning from the Primordial Pagoda!

Yang Ye was shocked because it had been very, very long since it had last given him a warning. Simply speaking, the flame before them made the Primordial Pagoda sense danger!

Yang Ye asked, “What is that?”

The Universe Sprite gazed at it for a long time and said, “Ask the Bodhi Tree!”

The Bodhi Tree!

Yang Ye immersed his consciousness into his body, and he noticed that the Bodhi Tree seemed quite restless as if it sensed danger.

“What is that flame?” Yang Ye’s face grew quite solemn.

A short while passed before he got an answer from the Bodhi Tree.

The Samadhi Flame!

The flame before them was one of the five Demonic Artifacts, the Samadhi Flame. Besides that, Yang Ye obtained another piece of information, and it was that besides the top ranked Sacred Artifact, the other four weren’t used for battle. The Primordial Pagoda, Bodhi Tree, and the other two Sacred Artifacts weren’t focused on attack, and they were auxiliary treasures. However, the Demonic Artifacts were different. All of them focused on attack, and they were extremely strong. So, in a one-on-one battle, besides the top ranked Sacred Artifact, the other four were no match for the Demonic Artifacts.

As for the Samadhi Flame…

Before the world was split open, there was a flame in the chaos. It grew for a billion years, condensed for a billion more, and formed a spirit a billion years after. It knows the world, is in harmony with all things, and has the same origin as all things, but it is superior to all things. Besides a few things in the world, there is nothing it cannot burn.

The Samadhi Flame!

After he received that description from the Bodhi Tree, a solemn expression appeared on Yang Ye’s face.

According to the Bodhi Tree, it was extremely formidable! So, there was a problem. How would he subdue it? Most importantly, a single mistake would end with his death!

Moreover, even the Primordial Pagoda couldn’t suppress it once it was unsealed!

Simply speaking, it didn’t fear the Primordial Pagoda!

If it fought the Primordial Pagoda, the Primordial Pagoda may be unable to defeat it. After all, the Primordial Pagoda wasn’t a treasure that focused on attacking!

It was a dilemma!

A huge dilemma!

Suddenly, the flame trembled, and then the temperature here rose rapidly. In an instant, Yang Ye noticed to his astonishment that his skin was actually starting to burn!

Yang Ye was shocked and hurriedly used the Primordial Armor!

However, as soon as it appeared around him, Yang Ye noticed that it was actually starting to melt!

The Primordial Armor was melting!
