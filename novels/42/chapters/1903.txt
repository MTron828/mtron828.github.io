Chapter 1904 – It’s Easy to Die in the Outside World!

Nansi Yin’s expression changed at the sight of this. She quickly went over to Yang Ye, grabbed his arm, and spoke softly, “Don’t be rash!”

They were in Northern Sky City. If Yang Ye acted rashly, they would definitely die.

A cup of tea had appeared in Bei Cangyue’s grasp, and she took a sip and acted as if she hadn’t seen Yang Ye’s actions.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye smiled and gazed at Nansi Yin, “Let’s go!”

Nansi Yin hesitated for a moment and nodded.

Meanwhile, Bei Cangyue smiled, “Feel free to visit when you’re free!”

Nansi Yin suddenly stopped and gazed at Bei Cangyue, “Actually, I’m quite curious. I’m sure that my identity is enough to make you not refuse us. However, you have. I’m very puzzled!”

Bei Cangyue grinned. “If you’re going alone, you can go at any time!”

Nansi Yin gazed at Yang Ye when she heard this.

She wasn’t against Nansi Yin going, she was against Yang Ye going!

Yang Ye thought for a moment and said, “I don’t think I’ve offended Northern Sky City.”

Bei Cangyue smiled, “Of course. But you seem to have offended someone else.”

As soon as he heard her, Yang Ye had a rough idea who it was.

That woman from the Shaman Hunter Clan!

Because only that woman knew he was heading to Broken Cliff Mountain, and the Shaman Hunter Clan seemed to be quite strong. So, only they had the ability to make Bei Cangyue stop him from passing through the city.

She just refused to stop hunting him!

Yang Ye shook his head and gazed at Nansi Yin, “Let’s go!”

He turned around and left.

Nansi Yin glanced at Bei Cangyue, “I heard you’re perceptive and are said to be a good judge of talent. But now that I’ve seen it for myself… Heh…”

As soon as she finished speaking, she left the hall.

After Nansi Yin left, a man in a luxurious robe suddenly appeared in the hall.

Bei Cangyue gazed at the man, and he shook his head slightly, “I wasn’t able to find out anything about him. However, I did find out that someone from the Shaman Hunter Clan died here!”

Bei Cangyue’s eyes narrowed slightly, “He did it?”

The man nodded slightly, “I’m not sure, but it’s very likely.”

“He dared to kill a member of the Shaman Hunter Clan!” A smile appeared on Bei Cangyue’s face, “Interesting.”

The man said, “Young Miss Yue, I’m sure you know he’s no ordinary person. So why don’t you let him go and make him owe you a favor?”

Bei Cangyue shook her head, “My clan has been defending Northern Sky Prefecture for generations, and the Shaman Hunter Clan has been helpful in our fight against the shaman race. So, we naturally can’t offend them for someone of unknown background.”

The man said, “But you’ve clearly offended that man and that young miss from the Nansi Clan!”

Bei Cangyue grinned, “She’s just a young miss of the Nansi Clan, not its successor. As for that man…”

She paused for a moment and spoke indifferently, “Not to mention a single person like him, so what if I offend a hundred?”

Confidence!

It wasn’t pride or conceit, it was confidence. The Northern Sky Prefecture and the Northern Sky King’s estate had such ability and confidence!

…

Once they left the pavilion, Nansi Yin’s face was extremely gloomy.

Yang Ye glanced at her and asked, “What is it?”DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Nansi Yin spoke in a low voice, “She wouldn’t have dared to do that if I was the Nansi Clan’s successor.”

Yang Ye couldn’t help but strike a blow to her confidence, “Unfortunately, you aren’t the successor!”

She grunted coldly in response, “At least she was willing to give me face. As for you, she didn’t want to give you any face!”

Yang Ye smiled, and then he glanced at the pavilion behind them, “She won’t treat me like that soon.”

Nansi Yin suddenly walked over to Yang Ye, “Who are you?”

Yang Ye replied, “Why are you suddenly asking that question?”

Nansi Yin replied, “It’s nothing. I’m just curious!”

Yang Ye said, “You’ll find out in the future. I…” He suddenly looked towards the side, “Show yourself!”

The space there trembled slightly, and then Yang Ye and Nansi Yin exchanged glances before vanishing on the spot.

A short while later, they arrived before an estate.

An old man appeared in front of them and gestured, “Please come in.”

Yang Ye asked, “Why?”

The old man said, “You’re going to Broken Cliff Mountain, right?”

A wisp of surprise flashed through Yang Ye’s eyes, “How did you know?”

The old man replied, “My young master can help you. He’s inside.”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and nodded, and then he intended to walk into the estate.

However, Nansi Yin suddenly grabbed his arm, “Aren’t you afraid that it’s a trap?”

Yang Ye smiled, “If anyone dares to set a trap for me, I’ll get a grave for him!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he entered the estate.

Nansi Yin was stunned for a moment and said, “What the…”

…

As soon as they entered the estate, a young man greeted them. He was around the age of 25, handsome, and had a smile on his face, “Welcome, Young Miss Nansi Yin, and this brother. Allow me to introduce myself. I’m Bei Cangqi, the young master of Northern Sky City. Bei Cangyue whom you just met is my elder sister. Right, my real elder sister!”

Bei Cangqi!

Nansi Ying lanced at him and said, “I didn’t know the Northern Sky King had a son!”

Bei Cangqi grinned, “Of course. Everyone knows my father and sister. As for me? Sigh, I’m embarrassed to say that I’m not that outstanding, and I’m a burden to them.”

Meanwhile, Yang Ye asked, “You can get me to Broken Cliff Mountain?”

Bei Cangqi nodded and smiled, “Of course.”

Yang Ye said, “Conditions!”

Bei Cangqi smiled, “You look quite strong, and I may have some trouble in the future. I hope you’ll help me when the time comes. Alright?”

Yang Ye glanced at him and said, “OK!”

Bei Cangqi smiled, “Thank you!”

As he spoke, he withdrew a jade slip and passed it to Yang Ye, “Go to Northern Sky Gate, and then show this to the person there. If nothing unexpected happens, you’ll be able to pass through.”

Yang Ye flicked a strand of his divine sense to Bei Cangqi, “Contact me if you need me!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he left with Nansi Yin.

Right after they left, the old man behind Bei Cangqi said, “Young Master, that jade slip can make that person at Northern Sky Gate help you do something. Are you really going to waste it like that?”

Bei Cangqi smiled, “How can you call it a waste?”

The old man said, “Even though the young miss of the Nansi Clan possesses quite an extraordinary identity, she doesn’t have any real authority, so she’s of no help to you. As for him, his strength might not be bad, but allow me to be honest, he may not be of much help to you either. At the very least, he can’t compare to that person at Northern Sky Gate!”

Bei Cangqi smiled and said, “Big Sister is amazing, extremely amazing, and she’s even better at father at some things. However, she cares too much about gains and losses. If you are too calculative, life would be meaningless.”

The old man wanted to say something, but he didn’t say anything in the end.

…

After they left the estate, Yang Ye and Nansi Yin shot towards the Northern Sky Gate, and it took them four hours to get there.

Northern Sky Gate!

It was tall!

Extremely tall!

That was Yang Ye’s first impression. It was at least 3km tall, and it could be said to rival a mountain. Moreover, it was extremely strong, and it was so strong that he felt that even a swing of his sword couldn’t pierce through it!

It was there to stop the shaman race!

Yang Ye had a rough understanding of the shaman race’s strength after seeing all of this.

Meanwhile, Nansi Yin suddenly asked, “Are you really planning on going to the Shaman Dimension?”

Yang Ye gazed at her, “Why?”

She hesitated for a moment and replied, “It’s very dangerous.”

Yang Ye asked, “Then why don’t you just stay here?”

She shook her head, “In the past, I only traveled through the Human Dimension, and because of my clan, practically all the other powers would give me some face and never make things difficult for me. I think that I can’t grow in such an environment. So, I’ve decided to go to the Shaman Dimension with you!”

Yang Ye said, “It’s easy to die in the outside world.”

Nansi Yin replied, “How can one grow without experiencing hardships?” She gazed at Yang Ye and continued, “Your cultivation is lower than both Gong Jin and I, but if it’s in terms of combat strength, even both of us together may not be able to defeat you. Why is that? It’s because you crawled out of life and death battles, and we have experienced too few battles like that!”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and said, “Then let’s go!”

He started walking towards the gate, and a wave of mysterious energy instantly locked onto him when he arrived before it.

Yang Ye felt like a hundred mountains were pressing down on him, and it was almost suffocating.

It really is guarded by extraordinary experts!Yang Ye calmed himself and flicked Bei Cangqi’s jade slip into the air.

As soon as the jade slip appeared, the aura around him gradually weakened, and then the jade slip suddenly vanished. The aura vanished along with the jade slip, and the gate before Yang Ye started opening slowly.

Yang Ye gazed at Nansi Yin, “Let’s go!”

She nodded and left the city with Yang Ye.

Not long after Yang Ye and Nansi Yin left, an old man and woman suddenly arrived here.

The old man glanced at the surroundings and spoke in a low voice, “You killed someone from my Shaman Hunter Clan! Hmph! Even if you’re the Chosen One of the Hallowed Grounds, I’ll still kill you!”
