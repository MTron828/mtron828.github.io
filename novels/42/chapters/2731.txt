Chapter 2732 – Ancestor! The Yang Clan’s Ancestor!

Yang Ye and An Nanjing dashed off quickly, but the black vortex refused to spare them and gave chase.

This time, it may not desire to kill them and just wanted spirit energy!

Yang Ye would naturally not give it any spirit energy. He didn’t know what was in there, so giving it spirit energy may very likely lead to his death.

Suddenly, the vortex stopped, and then Yang Ye and An Nanjing’s expressions changed drastically. Because the space before them cracked open, and then a spatial rift appeared there!

At the same time, numerous other strange spatial rifts appeared around them. The spatial rifts were all around them.

They’d been surrounded!

Yang Ye gazed at the black vortex, “Do you want to fight?”

A sword appeared in his grasp!

It was Past Life!

“A sword of Destiny!” Suddenly, an icy cold voice resounded from within the vortex, “Who are you? Why do you feel slightly familiar to me?!”

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly! The vortex actually knew about his sword!

Is it an existence suppressed by Destiny? And why did it say that it sensed a familiar feeling from me?

Yang Ye was about to speak when a few powerful auras appeared in the distant sky!

Yang Ye’s expression changed slightly and looked over. His face fell when he saw who it was!

It was Emperor Li, Zuo Mu, and the others!

Besides Heng Wangu, Emperor Li, Zuo Mu, First God, and Sky Saber were all here. Moreover, there was a mysterious black robed figure with them too!

They were back again!Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Yang Ye tightened his grip on his sword and no one knew what he was thinking.

Meanwhile, Emperor Li’s group had noticed Yang Ye and An Nanjing, and they were stunned for a moment when they saw them surrounded by those spatial rifts. But what came next was wild joy!

“Haha!” First God was the first to laugh, “Yang Ye! Oh, Yang Ye! Enemies really are meant to meet!”

He was about to attack but Zuo Mu shook his head, “Let’s focus on our priority first!”

First God hesitated for a moment and grunted coldly, “Fine, they can’t go anywhere anyway!”

Zuo Mu glanced at Yang Ye and An Nanjing, and then he gazed at the black vortex, “Senior, we’ve found a way to save you, and we’ve brought it. You just have to promise that you’ll help us kill a person, and we’ll save you right now!”

The black vortex fell silent for a short while, and then a voice resounded, “This fellow before us?”

Zuo Mu nodded, “Indeed.”

The voice asked, “All of you together can’t kill him? Are you kidding me?”

Zuo Mu spoke solemnly, “He’s rather special, and his strength is monstrous. You’ll understand once you fight him later!”

“Is that so?” A chuckle resounded, “Not bad. Looks like he’s an extraordinary genius, and I love killing extraordinary geniuses!”

Zuo Mu asked, “So you agree?”

The voice replied, “Of course.”

Zuo Mu nodded, and then he withdrew a pitch black gourd. A moment later, he tossed it into the vortex.

In an instant, countless strands of spirit energy filled the voice.

A short while later, the vortex started to tremble violently while more and more spirit energy surged out from the gourd. A short while later, waves of a powerful aura rippled out from the vortex, forcing Yang Ye and the others backward repeatedly.

Yang Ye’s face turned extremely solemn.

Which extraordinary expert is this?

Yang Ye didn’t try to stop it because Emperor Li, First God, Sky Saber, and even the mysterious black robed figure were eyeing him with hostility. If he dared to do anything, they would definitely attack him!

It was pointless to do anything now!

Suddenly, the black vortex exploded apart, and then a figure covered in blood red mist appeared. At the instant the figure appeared, an invisible aura rippled out into the surroundings!

Everyone including Yang Ye couldn’t help but move around 30m back!

Yang Ye’s face was extremely solemn because he’d witnessed such pressure from Tu, but this expert’s aura was even more overbearing. It had an aura of supremacy in it!

A short while later, the bloody mist dispersed to reveal a woman!

A woman in dark red armor and a saber in her grasp!

Her face was calm, but her eyes had absolute indifference in them. Besides that, there was a cut from a sword on her left cheek, and it was around the length of a thumb and very deep.

She glanced at Zuo Mu’s group, and Zuo Mu nodded slightly. She moved her gaze away and looked at Yang Ye instead, “I, Yang Busi, never owe people anything in my life. I’ve promised them that I would kill you, so I will. Now, you can give your head up to me!”

First God and the others smiled coldly. If Yang Busi couldn’t kill Yang Ye, they were still here to help out! However, would Yang Busi fail to kill Yang Ye? Was that even possible? She was a peerless figure who’d reigned supreme over the times!

Even Zuo Mu had an unprecedentedly relaxed expression on his face.

It was time for it to end.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye was stunned!

Yang Busi?

The previous patriarch of the Yang Clan?

Yang Ye was stunned for quite some time, and then he suddenly started crying.

Everyone here was stunned.

Yang Busi frowned, “Can’t you act like a man?”

She was about to attack when Yang Ye suddenly said, “Ancestor! I’ve finally found you!”

Ancestor!

First God and the others were stunned.

What the heck?! Ancestor?!

Yang Busi’s frown deepened, but she didn’t act. She just waved her saber, and a strand of saber energy shot through the air. A moment later, a pearl of blood emerged from Yang Ye’s forehead and instantly floated over to her.

She gazed at it for a short while, and then she gazed at Yang Ye, “You’re a member of my Yang Clan!”

Yang Ye nodded. He seemed very excited as he said, “I’m the Yang Clan’s current patriarch! Ancestor, when I heard Destiny was keeping you imprisoned, I went to great lengths in order to get through the 9th layer of space. It took me years to finally get here, and now, I’ve finally found you.”

He sighed softly while his face dimmed down, “Ancestor, our clan has been on a decline since you vanished. Now, there’s only a few hundred of us left…”

At this point, he suddenly pointed angrily at Zuo Mu and the others, “And these bastards actually refuse to spare our clan and refuse to spare me. They’ve been constantly hunting me, and I almost died at their hands on many occasions. I-I’ve really suffered so much!”

First God’s eyes narrowed slightly, “Yang Ye, do you want to die?”

He was about to attack as he spoke…

Suddenly, Yang Busi gazed at First God and spoke ferociously, “How dare you! You piece of trash! How dare you threaten someone from my clan?”

As soon as she finished speaking, she waved her saber forward.

Bang!

An explosion resounded, and then First God had been blasted 30km away. As soon as he stopped there, his body instantly exploded into bits…

Everyone who witnessed this was stunned.
