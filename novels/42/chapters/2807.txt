Chapter 2808 – Bully Me!

Yang Ye’s Order Sword Dao had just taken form, and he was still a little bit away from attaining the true Sword Dao of All.

However, based on the current situation, it was only a matter of time.

Yang Ye’s agreement had undoubtedly given them a way to survive. While they weren’t afraid of death, it didn’t mean they wanted to die. If they could live, that would naturally be for the best!

The experts of the Four Dimensional Universe were very grateful to Yang Ye.

Because he could kill them, yet he didn’t do so!

Yang Ye looked at the experts of the Four Dimensional Universe and sighed with emotion.

If it were in the past, he would slaughter all of them. Because he wouldn’t want to leave any potential threats behind.

But now, he was very well aware that if he did so, then his Dao of Order would change. Moreover, more and more people from the Three Dimensional Universe would die. After all, he couldn’t kill millions on his own. Especially if these experts of the Four Dimensional Universe chose to detonate themselves. It would be a calamity for the Three Dimensional Universe and Eternal Border.

Slaughter may be able to put an end to problems, but it couldn’t resolve the root problem. Moreover, Monarch Yan had sacrificed himself so that Yang Ye could understand the woman’s Dao, and that woman’s strength… It was something he couldn’t overlook.

A few million living beings weren’t a huge amount, and the Three Dimensional Universe could accommodate them! At the same time, he hoped that these experts of the Four Dimensional Universe could be used as a warning for the existing residents of the Three Dimensional Universe.

The Four Dimensional Universe had perished because they brought it on themselves.

If the Three Dimensional Universe didn’t cherish this world and destroyed it without restraint, a day would come when they suffered the same consequence, there would be a day when they too had no home to return to. Besides that, the presence of these experts would make the existing experts of the Three Dimensional Universe remain even more united. Especially if he was gone one day. He was certain that the Three Dimensional Universe would definitely not split up. Conversely, they would grow even more united!

Humans were fond of internal strife, but they were able to stay united in the face of formidable enemies!

Yang Ye gazed at Yan Ku, “Stay in Eternal Kingdom. I’ll separate an area for you. All of you will temporarily remain separated from the people of the Three Dimensional Universe!”

They had just fought to the death, so asking them to live together in harmony would definitely be difficult. The best way was to separate them.

Yan Ku nodded, “Alright!”

They didn’t want to be with the experts of the Three Dimensional Universe either. After all, they had just fought to the death!

Yang Ye flicked the Yanmo Ring over to Yan Ku and said, “Yan Ku, that ring is for you!”

Yan Ku gazed at Yang Ye with bewilderment, “What…?”

Yang Ye said, “Take care of yourselves on your own. However, while you live in the Three Dimensional Universe, you must abide by the rules of the Three Dimensional Universe. I’ll get someone to brief you on those rules later. It doesn’t matter if it’s all of you or the others from the Three Dimensional Universe, anyone who dares to violate those rules or act recklessly here will receive no mercy from me.”

Yan Ku nodded, “Understood. But…”

He passed the ring back to Yang Ye, “Please take care of this ring.”

“Huh?” This time, it was Yang Ye’s turn to be puzzled.

Yan Ku replied, “It controls two formations, and both of them are absolutely destructive. Especially in that world of ours. Once it’s activated, it would be extremely terrifying. If this ring remains in my possession, I’m afraid the others of my clan may have some ill thoughts.”

Yang Ye took a deep and long glance at Yan Ku. Actually, he’d done all of that to probe Yan Ku. He wanted to see if Yan Ku had other thoughts. If Yan Ku did, he wouldn’t hesitate to give these people of the Four Dimensional Universe a new leader.

Now it seemed like Yan Ku had probably guessed his thoughts.

Meanwhile, Yan Ku added, “Don’t worry, most of my clansmen are dead, and even our patriarch is dead. Coupled with the fact that we are still in danger from Destiny, just surviving is more than enough for us. We won’t have any other thoughts. Of course, I dare not guarantee what may happen in a thousand years from now. However, we will never incite a war while I’m still alive, and we will use our lives to protect the Three Dimensional Universe.”

He gazed at the Yanmo Ring and continued, “The formations in the Four Dimensional Universe were built in secret by my clan, and they were built for the sake of fighting against Destiny. They are our final trump cards because once they are activated, the Four Dimensional Universe would perish. Now, you’re the only one capable of activating those formations, and its full strength can only be unleashed with the help of the Good Sprite. I think those formations will be of use to you!”

Yang Ye put the ring away, “Are there more people in the Four Dimensional Universe?”

Yan Ku nodded, “Yes!”

Yang Ye frowned slightly, “How many?”

Yan Ku replied softly, “I do not know. It’s very difficult to move everyone. Especially the very weak. Even we are unable to accomplish that.”

Yang Ye asked, “All of them will die, right?”

Yan Ku nodded, “Destiny’s sword has descended upon our universe twice, and it caused a calamity on both occasions. Our universe won’t last for long. As for the sprites of the Four Dimensional Universe, it’s not that we refuse to help them… we can’t. We came here for war, and they were weak, so bringing them with us would only speed up their deaths.”

Yang Ye spoke softly, “Go save them.”

Yan Ku gazed at Yang Ye, and the latter spoke softly, “The Three Dimensional Universe is huge, so a few more won’t be a problem.”

Yan Ku bowed deeply to Yang Ye again, “Thank you!”

It was sincere gratitude!Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Yang Ye nodded, “I’ll go with you and have a look at the Four Dimensional Universe on the way.”

Yan Ku nodded. Just like that, Yan Ku led Yang Ye and a group of Destiny Realm experts to the Four Dimensional Universe.

A short while later, they arrived in the Four Dimensional Universe, and Yang Ye saw the floating city again.

Yan Ku led Yang Ye into the city. There were many signs of life in the city, and it was in extreme chaos. It was full of murder, robbery, and all sorts of heinous crimes…

When the end of the world arrived for a world, people would fall to despair, and people in despair would madly unleash the darkness within them.

A person could be very kindhearted, but that same person could be absolutely evil too.

As he watched the scenes before him, he thought of the Three Dimensional Universe. It had been the same earlier. When the entire world was collapsing, the strong may be able to protect themselves, but what about the weak?

It was the same for all worlds. Once war erupted, it was always the weak who died. Those with power, authority, or strength always had a way to survive.

Human life was worthless in chaotic times!

A short while later, many of the living beings from the Four Dimensional Universe arrived before Yan Ku, Yang Ye, and the others.

All of them had fear and despair in their eyes!

They knew that their fates were sealed. They wanted to leave this place, but they didn’t dare to act against Yan Ku’s group. So, only despair remained in their eyes.

There was no difference between the laws of survival in the Three Dimensional Universe and Four Dimensional Universe!

The weak left their fate to destiny!

For example, Destiny could annihilate all the living beings here with a single thought, and she could do the same for the Three Dimensional Universe too.

No one could stop her, and the fate of all living things could be decided with a single thought of hers!

Yan Ku gazed at Yang Ye, “All of them have fallen to the chaos.”

If it was possible, he naturally wanted to save these people from the Four Dimensional Universe. However, their minds had fallen to chaos due to the terror they felt, and now, they were capable of anything!

He didn’t want to save them anymore.

Bringing them to the Three Dimensional Universe wouldn’t be a good thing, and they may cause a lot of trouble instead. They may spoil the peace they’d attained with great difficulty.

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings, and his gaze could see everything in the city. A short while later, a voice rumbled through the city like a thunderclap, “I do not bully the good. If anyone has not killed or committed any other crimes, you can leave with me!”

When they heard this voice, countless people in the city looked toward Yang Ye, and then all of them surrounded Yang Ye’s group. Some of them who’d lost themselves to the chaos even attacked Yang Ye’s group.

However, they were annihilated by Yan Ku before they could even get close to Yang Ye!

After a few were killed, the others gradually calmed down, and then the viciousness in their eyes turned into pleading glows.

Yang Ye ignored them and gazed at Yan Ku. The latter nodded, “I’ll choose. I won’t make a mistake.”

Yang Ye nodded.

Yang Ye wasn’t a very good person, and so he wouldn’t just save everyone. Some weren’t worth saving, and they deserved death instead. However, there were innocents, there were those who’d stayed the same amid the chaos and hadn’t committed any crimes.

The good and bad didn’t deserve the same ending.

His order differentiated between good and bad!

The good were good, and the bad were bad. He intended to help the good and suppress the bad! If they refused to accept it, they could fight him!

At the instant he thought about differentiating between good and bad in his Order, Yang Ye hadn’t noticed that his sword was trembling slightly. It was very slight trembling, so slight that even he didn’t notice it.

Order included many things, emotions, a lack of emotions, right and wrong, justice and injustice, good and bad…

Yang Ye turned around and walked away while Yan Ku started choosing. With his strength as a Destiny Realm expert, just a single glance would allow him to discern who had killed and even discern their character.

Two hours later, countless arrived outside the city. There was still quite a large number of them, a few hundred thousand in fact!

Meanwhile, countless stared at the people outside the city from within it. Their eyes contained undisguised desires to kill and displeasure, even rage!

“It’s unfair!” Suddenly, a voice resounded from the city wall, and then a man leaped down from above. He glared angrily at Yang Ye, “Chaos is arriving, so the strong survive. What’s wrong with that? Why are these weaklings allowed to go with you, but we cannot?”

Yan Ku frowned and was about to take action when Yang Ye shook his head and stopped Yan Ku. Yang Ye gazed at the man, and Yan Ku said, “He killed 107 people, stole a huge number of crystals, and he has a group under his command.”

The man suddenly howled with fury, “We only did it to survive!”

Yang Ye looked the man in the eyes, “You killed to survive? Because you’re strong, so you can look down on the weak?”

The man spoke fiercely, “What’s wrong with that?”

Yang Ye suddenly tapped his finger forward, and two rays of sword energy flashed.

Hiss! Hiss!

The man hadn’t even been able to react before his arms flew into the air!

Yang Ye spoke indifferently, “I’m stronger than you, and I can’t stand the sight of you. So, what do you think about that?”

The man’s face was terrifyingly fierce.

Yang Ye walked over to him, “Bullying the good isn’t that great, if you’re really strong, then bully someone more evil than yourself.”

Yang Ye pointed at himself, “Come on! Bully me!”
