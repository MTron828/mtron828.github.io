Chapter 2081 – Soulmend Casket!

Yang Ye left. He’d only said that on a whim, and even he may not be aware that what he said so randomly would change a person’s fate.

Yang Ye found an empty area in the city and entered the Primordial Pagoda.

Cultivate!

Even though he’d attained the Zen Realm, he did cheat a little to get this far. So, he had to spend some time consolidating his cultivation.

The Zen Realm!

It was definitely like a dividing mountain. He’d passed over it, and his strength had improved tremendously as a result. Now, he naturally didn’t fear anyone below the Sage Realm. But the problem was that all his opponents were Sages now!

So, he was in a difficult position!

All along the way, Yang Ye noticed that cultivating was like climbing mountains. When you reach the top of the mountain, you’ll realize that there was a taller mountain up ahead, and when you get up to the top of that mountain, you’ll make the same discovery again…

Cultivation was an endless process!

Even those progenitors didn’t dare to say that they’d arrived at the end of the path of cultivation.

Besides that, Yang Ye had one more thing to do, and it was to play with Snowy and Tian Xiu. Snowy’s thoughts were very simple, and it was to play. Her life was naturally a carefree one, but that was exactly what Yang Ye wanted.

He would never let that little fellow bear any kind of pressure. Moreover, based on her ability, she could live a carefree life no matter who she chose to stay with. He never doubted this because even the progenitors would be willing to accept her!

Who wouldn’t want a Sprite Lord?

Time passed very quickly, and three days passed in the blink of an eye.

Yang Ye left the Primordial Pagoda and went to the auction house. This time, he met a different attendant.

She glanced at him and said, “We’re holding the auction today, so you must display your proof of entrance to enter.”

Yang Ye was about to withdraw the silver card when a voice suddenly resounded, “Senior, is that you?”

Yang Ye turned to look towards the source of it, and he saw Xiao Yue.

Xiao Yue strode swiftly to Yang Ye, bowed slightly, and said, “Senior, please come with me. I’ve prepared a room for you.”

Yang Ye nodded and entered with her. She led Yang Ye to a luxurious room, and it was many times more luxurious than the room he’d been led to when he came here for the first time.

Moreover, the tea was different too. The tea he had now contained dense spirit energy, and it was clearly extraordinary!

Meanwhile, Xiao Yue pointed at the screen on the wall, “Senior, when the auction starts, you can watch it here, and if you like anything, you can press the red button beside you.’

She paused for a moment and added, “But Senior, you must remember to only make real bids. If you don’t have sufficient money when it’s time to pay, the auction house will be ruthless.”

Yang Ye nodded, “I understand.”

Xiao Yue nodded slightly, “Senior, your treasure will be auctioned today too. Right, if it’s sold, the auction house will take a fee of 5%. It’s part of the rules.”

Yang Ye asked, “Will many be participating?”

Xiao Yue smiled, “Yes. Because the auction house has a divine treasure this time. However, my authority is limited, so I don’t know what it is. However, you’ll be able to see it later.”

Yang Ye nodded and didn’t speak further.

Xiao Yue said, “Senior, just tell me if you need anything else.”

She was very sensible and left once she finished speaking.

Yang Ye gazed at the wall. It didn’t take long for a beautiful woman to appear there. She was standing on a round platform, and it was floating in midair. She glanced at the surroundings and smiled, “Thank you for attending our auction. Now, allow us to show you many rare treasures! I hope you’ll all leave satisfied tonight!”

She waved her hand lightly. In an instant, a white jade box appeared in her grasp, and everyone watched as she opened it with a smile on her face. There was a fist-sized white pearl in it!

Yang Ye frowned, “What’s that?”

Meanwhile, the woman smiled, “An inner core that belonged to a Sage Realm demon beast!”

Clamorous noise resounded!

The inner core of a Sage Realm demon beast!

Yang Ye was quite shocked as well because it was an absolutely precious treasure! Especially to him. His current physical strength was comparable to a Major Zen Realm demon beast, so if he swallowed that inner core, he may be able to rise a level higher with the energy it contained!

However, Yang Ye knew that it would definitely be absolutely expensive.

Sure enough, the woman continued, “The lowest price is 300,000 immortal crystals, and the minimum increment is 50,000 immortal crystals. The bidding starts now.”

In the room, Yang Ye was really quite tempted, and he wished for nothing more than to summon Snowy and make her produce millions of immortal crystals. Unfortunately, it wasn’t realistic, and Snowy would kill him.

Meanwhile, the bids for the inner core had gone up to 800,000, and it seemed like it may go higher.

“900,000!” The beautiful woman suddenly said, “900,000! Any higher bids?”

“950,000!” A low voice resounded.

The woman looked over to its source while a brilliant smile bloomed on her face, “950,000! Anyone want to bid a million?”

The surroundings fell silent.

A Sage Realm demon beast’s inner core was precious, but 950,000 immortal crystals was a huge amount! Only large clans and some other organizations were capable of producing such an amount of immortal crystals. Moreover, even if they possessed it, it would still hurt!

In any case, Yang Ye couldn’t afford it!

The beautiful woman glanced at the surroundings and smiled, “950,000 once! 950,000 twice! 950,000 thrice!”

She put the box away and smiled, “Sold!”

Just like that, the inner core had a new owner.

At this moment, Yang Ye had the slight urge to rob it. However, it was only a thought. If it wasn’t his, he usually wouldn’t try to get it by force! Moreover, since that person had been able to pay so much, it was definitely not an ordinary person! ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Suddenly, the beautiful woman smiled, “Firstly, thank you for attending this auction. There’s something I have to clarify. Everyone must abide by the rules here, and it’s that fighting is prohibited. As for outside the auction house, that isn’t the auction house’s business anymore.”

Yang Ye glanced at the woman. Obviously, she was afraid that someone would cause trouble. It made sense because if even the auction house wasn’t safe, would anyone dare to buy or sell here?

Thus, once someone attacked another here, it would cause extremely adverse effects to the auction house!

Meanwhile, the beautiful woman smiled, “I believe that since you’re here, you’re definitely well aware of my auction house’s rules. So, I won’t speak more about it. Now, let’s take a look at the second treasure for today!”

As soon as she finished speaking, she waved her hand and another white jade box appeared in her grasp.

She smiled and opened it. There was a pitch black rock within it, and it was the size of an adult’s head!

She glanced at the surroundings and said, “It’s called Meteorite Iron, and it’s at the Sage Rank. Based on my auction house’s estimations, if it’s used to craft a sword, saber, or any other weapon, it should be able to be made into at least three. In other words, it can produce at least three Sage Rank weapons.”

She paused for a moment and smiled, “Of course, it’s just our estimation. The equipment refiner’s skill plays a huge role in it. The starting price is 200,000 immortal crystals, and the minimum increment is 50,000 immortal crystals. Begin!”

Meteorite Iron!

Yang Ye withdrew his gaze. While it was a good treasure, it wasn’t that attractive to him. He was a sword cultivator, and he had the best swords already. Both the Sword Supreme and Judgment were one of the best swords in this world!

Of course, he couldn’t get it even if he wanted to. The Soulmend Casket was the most important to him.

As for everything else, he could only look even if he wanted it!

Around 15 minutes later, the rock was sold for 500,000 immortal crystals.

Meanwhile, another box appeared in the beautiful woman’s grasp, and there was a pair of gloves in it!

Yang Ye’s attention was instantly aroused when he noticed this. After all, it was his!

The woman smiled, “This is a page of Sage Rank gloves in perfect condition. Regardless of whether you’re a body cultivator or any other cultivator, possessing it will definitely improve your strength by a level. I’m sure all of you can discern that for yourselves. The starting bid is 400,000 immortal crystals, and the minimum increment is 50,000 immortal crystals!

“500,000!” A voice resounded from below.

“550,000!” Another voice resounded.

“600,000…” Yang Ye’s heart skipped a beat with every bid! He didn’t really care about immortal crystals in the past, and that was because he had enough for himself. Yet now, he realized that they were extremely useful. Moreover, he’d also realized that he was very poor!

“700,000!”

“750,000!”

Just like that, the price stopped at 750,000 after around 15 minutes passed.

750,000! Yang Ye took a deep breath and calmed himself. While he was a little dissatisfied by the amount, it was still alright!

“Everyone!” Suddenly, the woman smiled and said, “The next item is something that all soul cultivators and anyone with an injured soul should not miss!”

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly.

Obviously, the next item would be the Soulmend Casket!
