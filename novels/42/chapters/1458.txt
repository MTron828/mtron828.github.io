Chapter 1459 – Little Sky Continent!

At this moment, Yang Ye was beyond shocked.

Because he hadn’t expected Little Sky to actually be aware that there was another world within him!

Or to be more precise, it wasn’t within him but within the Primordial Pagoda. Since she knew about it, then it represented that she knew about the Primordial Pagoda?

Yang Ye gazed at her for a very long time before he asked, “How did you know?”

Little Sky replied, “I saw it!”

Yang Ye asked, “How did you see it?

She spoke as a matter of course, “I just saw it!”

Yang Ye’s face was dark, “Why can you see it while others can’t?”

She blinked and replied with a question, “Why can’t others see it?”

Yang Ye’s face twitched. Can we even talk properly?

Meanwhile, she suddenly said, “Actually, I’m really curious as well. You actually have a world within your body, and it has no laws, no Heaven Dao, or cycle of reincarnation. It’s really amazing. Let me go inside and have a look, alright? I’m really, really curious about it!”

Yang Ye remained silent for a long time, and then he said, “You can go in, but you have to answer a question of mine.”

She was quite excited, “Hurry up and ask me!”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and asked, “Is there someone behind me?”

She blinked and looked behind Yang Ye. A short while passed before she looked back at him, “Can’t you see it?”

Yang Ye clenched his hands slowly. She’s still there.

Meanwhile, Little Sky spoke softly, “Right, you shouldn’t be able to see her!”

Yang Ye was very puzzled, “Why?”

Little Sky spoke softly, “Only two types of people in this world are able to see her. The first are the dead, those that are completely dead. As for the other type....”

Yang Ye said, “People like you?”

Little Sky suddenly said, “Did I tell you that I’m a person?”

Yang Ye was astounded, “You’re not human?”

She replied, “Yes!”

“Then what are you?”

She blinked, “I don’t know!”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

It’s impossible to talk with her!

Yang Ye shook his head and said, “What’s the other type of person?”

She replied, “Those who are extremely strong!”

Isn’t that obvious?! Yang Ye rolled his eyes. He hesitated for a moment, and then he asked, “Since you can see her, didn’t she act against you?”

The mysterious woman had killed anyone who noticed her presence, but she hadn’t acted against Little Sky, and it made Yang Ye very curious.

Little Sky was puzzled, “Why should she?”

Yang Ye didn’t know what to say.

Little Sky asked, “Can I go in now?”

Yang Ye glanced at her and asked, “Since you can see her, can you help me ask her why she’s following me and what she wants?”

Little Sky looked behind Yang Ye. It didn’t take long for her to look once more at Yang Ye, and then she shook her head, “She refuses to say.”

Yang Ye fell silent for a while, and then he asked, “Do you know anything about her origins?”

Little Sky nodded.

Yang Ye hurriedly asked, “What is it?”

Little Sky hurriedly shook her head, “I can’t say.”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Why?”

Little Sky replied, “Because she threatened me!”

“She threatened you?” Yang Ye was astounded, “How did she threaten you?”

Little Sky glanced at him and spoke softly, “She said that she’ll kill you if I tell you.”

Yang Ye felt speechless.

Little Sky asked softly, “Do you still want to know?”

The corners of Yang Ye’s mouth twitched, Do I? Of course I don’t!

At this moment, Yang Ye felt quite lucky. Because it proved that she didn’t want him to see her, and she didn’t want him to know about her origins. If he’d utilized the Sword Domain to detect her presence, then he would have definitely been in trouble!

Yang Ye remained silent for a long time, and then he said, “One last question. Why do you know about her origins? Didn’t you lose your memories?”

“I have!” She continued, “Why do I know about her even after I lost my memories? I even know about your origins. You’re Yang Ye, and you’re from a place called Profounder Continent....”

“You....” Yang Ye’s eyes opened wide, “Why? Why do you know all of that?”

She spoke as a matter of course, “I know because I want to know!”

His face stiffened, You know because you want to?!

At this moment, the shock Yang Ye felt was at an extreme. After all, it was extremely strange and mysterious that Little Sky knew where he was from.

Yang Ye remained silent for a long time before he said, “Do you have some sort of ability that allows you to gain information about someone’s past if you desire it?”

She blinked and said, “It seems to be like that. I was very curious about you just now, so I really wanted to know who you are, and then information about you appeared in my mind. However, they were all in bits. For example, where you’re from, your name, and what you’ve done. But it isn’t complete. All of them are just bits and pieces. I want to find out more, but it makes my mind quite uncomfortable.”

Yang Ye took a deep breath, That’s an absolutely heaven defying ability! No, even that word can’t fully describe how terrifying it is!

Little Sky said, “Actually, based on your fate, you shouldn’t have been able to survive until now. However, you have. If your fate had changed, then it would make sense. But the problem is that it hasn’t. You’re still cursed by the heavens. People with such fate are usually unable to live past their 18th birthday.”

“Cursed by the heavens? What’s that?” Yang Ye frowned. He wasn’t able to understand a lot of things that she spoke about.

Little Sky replied, “Fate and rebirth are things that you’ll come into contact with in the future.”

Yang Ye asked, “Then do you know why I’ve been able to live until now?”

She thought for a long time before she said, “It might be related to your character.”

“My character?” He asked, “What do you mean?”

Little Sky replied, “Nothing is absolute in the world. Hopeless situations and difficulties may be able to crush a person, but it might build up a person as well. You know... a very, very long time ago, the human race was the weakest in the universe. Regardless of whether it was the demon race or other races, all of them were much stronger than the human race. However, the human race constantly strived to grow stronger. Not only did it avoid vanishing from the universe, it created its own system of cultivation and civilization, and it became one of the strongest species in the universe.”

She gazed at Yang Ye when she spoke up to this point and continued, “Your fate made you suffer all sorts of hardships, but you faced them all and created your own path. So, not only did your fate not become a burden to you, it helped you grow instead.”

Yang Ye smiled, “So I should thank it?”

Little Sky grinned, “I can see that you don’t believe in vague and ethereal things like fate. But it does make sense. It’s something that affects those who believe it, and while it still affects those who don’t believe in it, so long as you don’t believe in it, then it’s actually equivalent to being nonexistent. In short, the strong take control of their own destiny!”

Yang Ye smiled, “I agree with that. Regardless of how great a person’s fate is, if that person doesn’t possess strength, then that person may still lose his or her life. So, I only believe in my own hands. Miss Little Sky, since you want to go in and have a look, then go in!”

Actually, she was too mysterious and strange, so he didn’t want to have anything to do with her. However, if he thought about it from another angle, it wasn’t disadvantageous to be friends with her. There were two reasons why he’d allowed her to enter the Primordial Pagoda. Firstly, it was because she knew about it. Secondly, he wasn’t afraid of her entering it.

If she didn’t know about the Primordial Pagoda, then he would definitely not expose it. But the problem was that she knew. Since she knew about the world within him, it wasn’t a problem to let her have a look at it. In any case, unless he led her to the other levels, she wouldn’t even be able to find the entrance to them.

Actually, there was one last reason. It was because he was confident in the Primordial Pagoda.

She was very mysterious and strong. However, could she be more mysterious and stronger than the Primordial Pagoda? Could she do anything once she got in there?

Absolutely not!

However, this incident allowed Yang Ye to realize that he had to be even more careful in the future. The world was huge, and there were countless capable people in it. The slightest mistake might cause something similar to happen and expose the Primordial Pagoda’s existence within him.

As soon as she heard him, a brilliant smile appeared on her face, and then she transformed into a ray of white light that surged towards Yang Ye’s chest.

However....

Bang!

She’d only just come into contact with Yang Ye’s chest when she was instantly blasted backwards.

Yang Ye was stunned. He hadn’t expected the Primordial Pagoda to refuse her entry. Why? Did the Primordial Pagoda fear her? That was impossible. After all, the Primordial Pagoda would have given him a warning if it did fear her.

Little Sky blinked, and there was a similar trace of bewilderment in her eyes, “Why can’t I go in?”

Yang Ye replied, “It might be rejecting you!”

Little Sky asked, “Why?” Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Yang Ye shook his head, “I’d like to know too.”

“Can you make it not reject me?” Little Sky walked over to Yang Ye and spoke softly, “Please, I want to have a look.”

“Er....” Yang Ye was put in quite a difficult position. He knew that the Primordial Pagoda definitely had a reason for denying her entry. In any case, the Primordial Pagoda wouldn’t harm him. But he’d promised her that he would let her in to have a look. So, it wasn’t good to go back on his word right now.

Yang Ye thought for a while and said, “Let me talk with it. I can’t do anything if it insists on refusing.”

She hurriedly nodded, “Alright!”

Yang Ye closed his eyes and immersed his consciousness into his body. A long time passed before he opened his eyes, “Try again.”

She nodded, and then she transformed into a ray of white light that surged towards Yang Ye’s chest. This time, the Primordial Pagoda didn’t stop her, and she entered the world in the 1st level of the Primordial Pagoda.

Yang Ye immersed his consciousness into his body.

In the world within the 1st level, Little Sky was ceaselessly scanning the surroundings, and her eyes were filled with curiosity, excitement, and a trace of nervousness.

After looking around for a long time, she suddenly spoke happily, “No slaughter, no war, no fighting, and no Heaven Dao. It’s quiet, and everything is beautiful. Perfect! I’ll stay here from now on, and this place will be called Little Sky Continent from now on!”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words when he heard this.
