Chapter 1047 – So, Please Shut Up!

Soul Ignition! Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly. He hadn’t expected that the man would actually ignite his soul!

Soul Ignition could provide a tremendous increase in strength to the user, but the price was death! What enmity does he have with me to actually not hesitate to ignite his soul?

Yang Ye didn’t dare act carelessly. He stretched out his right hand, and an intent sword condensed in his grasp before sheathing it!

Suddenly, Yang Ye’s expression changed, and he looked up into the sky. A ray of white light appeared far away in the distance, but it didn’t take long for it to arrive before the black robed man.

The light dispersed and a white clothed man appeared before them.

The white clothed man walked over to the black robed man, and then he lightly patted the black robed man on the shoulder. A strand of white energy surged out from within the white clothed man’s hand and entered the black robed man. It didn’t take long for the flames on the black robed man’s body to gradually vanish. However, the black robed man slumped down to the ground. His face was ghastly pale as he gasped for breath, and he seemed like he was terribly sick!

The black robed man stared fixedly at the white clothed man, “Why did you stop me!”

The white clothed man spoke indifferently, “You’ll have a chance to take revenge. Why do something as stupid as igniting your soul?”

“He killed Xing Chen!” The black robed man spoke ferociously, and he simply seemed like a roaring wild beast, “He killed Xing Chen!”

“I know!” The white clothed man nodded slightly, “However, what if you’re still unable to kill him after you ignite your soul?”

The black robed man stared fixedly at the white clothed man in silence.

The white clothed man said, “You have to be alive if you want to avenge your younger sister.”

As soon as he finished speaking, the white clothed man turned around to look at Yang Ye, “As expected of the one who dares to challenge my White Deer Academy. Your strength isn’t bad at all. But didn’t you go a little too far by being so ruthless against a woman.”

“A woman?” Yang Ye shook his head, “In my opinion, so long as one is my enemy, then it doesn’t matter if that person is a woman or not. I’ll kill them all without hesitation. After all, if I were weak, then it might be the women of my academy and city that died. At that time, would you step forward and seek justice for the women of my academy and city? No, you wouldn’t. So, please shut your mouth. If you want to fight, then attack. Otherwise, just fuck off!”

The white clothed man gazed at Yang Ye for a long time and said, “Looks like staying here for so long has caused you to be confident to the point of believing that you’re unrivaled.”

Om!

Suddenly, Yang Ye drew his sword, and a strand of sword energy arrived before the white clothed man!

The white clothed man’s pupils constricted slightly as he hadn’t expected Yang Ye to actually attack just like that. But his reaction wasn’t slow at all, and a beam of white light had surged out from him at the instant that Yang Ye had drawn his sword.

Bang!

A huge explosion resounded. The white light dispersed, and the white clothed man took 10 steps back!

The white clothed man’s eyes narrowed slightly while killing intent appeared within them.

However, Yang Ye paid no further attention to them, and he just turned around and left. He walked off for a while before he suddenly stopped and said, “There are 2 reasons why I’m not killing both of you. Firstly, I don’t have the time to play the game of facing your seniors after I’m done with both of you. Secondly, help me take a message back to Law Faction. I’ll be on time for the competition at White Deer Academy. Doesn’t the Law Faction want to kill me and destroy Ocean of Clouds Academy? If you have the ability, then feel free to come at me then!”

There was a wisp of ridicule visible on the corners of the white clothed man’s mouth, “How laughable! You’re actually thinking of going against my White Deer Academy! Alright, we’ll be waiting for you. We’ll be waiting for you to come with the students of your academy. Yang Ye, we know that you’re trying to buy time so that we don’t act against Ocean of Clouds Academy right now. Don’t worry, we’ll allow it. Once you arrive at the Central Divine Prefecture, you’ll realize how laughable what you said just now is!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he grabbed the black robed man and vanished into the sky.

After the 2 of them left, 2 rays of light flashed by, and then Daoist Gu and Jian Wuchen appeared in front of Yang Ye.

Jian Wuchen spoke in a low voice, “You’re really going to go to White Deer Academy in the future?”

Yang Ye nodded, “I don’t have a choice.” He really didn’t. If he didn’t go, then the academy and city would definitely be annihilated while he would be pursued by the experts of White Deer Academy! He had to head there, defeat the monstrous geniuses of the Law Faction, and obtain the acknowledgement of White Deer Academy’s higher-ups. Only then would he, the academy, and the city be safe!

Others would only help those that had value in their eyes. He was going to White Deer Academy to prove his value!

Jian Wuchen spoke in a low voice, “That place is much more terrifying than you think!”

“I know!” Yang Ye nodded, and then he gazed at Jian Wuchen and said, “I intend to withdraw from the Ancient Sword School!”

Jian Wuchen and Daoist Gu’s expressions changed slightly. A short while passed before Jian Wuchen shook his head, “I know that you don’t want to drag us down with you, but do you realize how it’s also an opportunity for our Ancient Sword School? Even though you’re the dean of Ocean of Clouds Academy, you’re a disciple of our Ancient Sword School in the end. If you really make a dazzling display during that competition, then our Ancient Sword School would benefit from it as well.”

Yang Ye spoke in a low voice, “But I might bring calamity to the sword school as well!”

Jian Wuchen said, “If we don’t go through tough times together, then how can we share our glory?”

Meanwhile, Daoist Gu nodded, “Kid, you have to realize that our Ancient Sword School has only produced 2 geniuses, Lu Wan’er and you, in the recent years. Even though Wan’er is an extraordinary genius in the Sword Dao, she would probably only be ordinary in the Central Divine Prefecture. Only you are capable of fighting those monstrous geniuses of the Central Divine Prefecture. So, if our Ancient Sword School intends to go further than Pine Prefecture, then it has to rely on you.”

Yang Ye laughed bitterly, “Suddenly, I feel a huge amount of pressure pressing down on me. Senior, give me more Divine Rank treasures to relive this pressure!”

Jian Wuchen spoke flatly, “Now that you’ve mentioned that. Kid, isn’t it time for you to return those Divine Rank treasures?”

Yang Ye’s face stiffened, but it didn’t take long for it to return to normal. He suddenly spoke in an extremely serious tone, “Senior, I’m sure you’ve realized that all my enemies are Saints now. I might be killed at any moment without those treasures! They are treasures that keep me alive, so taking them back is equivalent to asking for my life.”

Daoist Gu and Jian Wuchen’s faces twitched when they heard him, and then Jian Wuchen shook his head with a helpless expression on his face, “That day when we lent those treasures to you, I had a feeling that we wouldn’t be able to get them back. Don’t act like you’ve been wronged. We’ve unanimously decided to give those treasures to you.”

“That....” Yang Ye was overjoyed in his heart, but he put on a troubled expression instead, “How... how could I possibly accept that? We’d agreed that they were only being lent to me, yet you’re speaking about giving them to me. I... I can’t really accept that!”

Jian Wuchen said, “If you can’t, then feel free to give it back to us!”

Yang Ye immediately shook his head, “How could I possibly refuse your good intentions? Don’t worry, Seniors. I’ll definitely take good care of them!”

The corners of Jian Wuchen’s mouth twitched, and he shook his head, “You... you really are shameless!”

Yang Ye’s face darkened, but it didn’t make a fuss about it because they’d given him those Divine Rank treasures.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye seemed to have thought of something and flicked a spatial ring to Daoist Gu, “I got these from Welkin Wolf Demon King’s treasury. They’re all ores at the Saint Rank. I hope you can forge them into swords!” Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Daoist Gu’s divine sense swept through the spatial ring, and his hand trembled when he saw the amount of Saint Rank ores within the spatial ring. A short while passed before he gulped and said, “If... if I knew Welkin Wolf Demon King was this wealthy, I would have robbed him a long time.”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

Daoist Gu took a deep breath, “Kid, you came to the right person. Only I am capable of forging them throughout Pine Prefecture. Kid, just you wait. I’ll make a peerless sword formation for you! Hahaha!” As soon as he finished speaking, Daoist Gu actually transformed into a ray of light that vanished into the sky.

“I would definitely be the number one expert of our sword school if he wasn’t obsessed with forging!” Jian Wuchen shook his head, “Alright, since you’re fine, it’s time for me to return as well. If you need something, then don’t hold back because the Ancient Sword School will always be standing behind you!”

Jian Wuchen transformed into a ray of light that vanished into the horizon after he finished speaking.

Yang Ye’s heart felt warm as he gazed at the direction they left towards. No matter what, the Ancient Sword School had always treated him as one of their own.

Yang Ye remained silent for a long time before he gazed towards the north.

Sky Divine Hall! Lou Qianxiao!

I have half a month left!

A long time passed before Yang Ye withdrew a talisman and crushed it. It didn’t take long for Qing and Hong to appear before him.

Hong spoke coldly, “Why did you summon us?”

Yang Ye asked, “Has the Python Clan taken any action lately?”

Qing shook her head lightly, “Since you drove the Welkin Wolf Clan out of Welkin Wolf Mountain Range, there has been a difference in opinion within the Python Clan. Many elders proposed that the clan should take the initiative to repair its relationship with Ocean of Clouds Academy, but their proposals were denied by the current patriarch.

Yang Ye said, “Because he wants to gain the protection and support of Sky Divine Hall, right?”

Qing nodded, “Sky Divine Hall seems to have promised him something!”

Yang Ye nodded, “Let’s go!”

Qing was puzzled, “Where?”

Yang Ye replied, “To the Python Clan!”

Qing was pleasantly surprised, “You... you intend to help us reclaim control over the Python Clan?”

Yang Ye nodded.

“But... but the Python Clan has formed an alliance with the Steel Ape Clan. They’d agreed to face everything together. Won’t we....”

“That’s perfect! I’ll deal with them at once!”
