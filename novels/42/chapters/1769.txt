Chapter 1770 – The Final Battle!

It really wasn’t like how he’d imagined it going!

Because as far as he was concerned, the Ying Clan’s patriarch should accept his challenge. After all, Ying Qing was the patriarch of an extraordinary clan. If he didn’t accept the challenge, it would be a terrible humiliation once news of it spread.

That was why Yang Ye had dared to come up here by himself. It was because he felt Ying Qing would definitely fight him in single combat.

So long as it was single combat, he would hesitate to tear off the talisman on his right arm and use the wooden sword to instantly kill Ying Qing.

Once the Ying Clan’s patriarch was dead, the morale of this army before him would definitely fall into chaos!

That was his plan!

However, while the plan was a good one, reality was cruel. Ying Qing refused to give him such an opportunity and ordered the others to attack him.

Ying Qing would naturally not choose to fight Yang Ye in single combat. If he hadn’t witnessed how Yang Ye injured his ancestor, then perhaps he would. However, after he witnessed that, he knew that he couldn’t do anything to this young man who stood before him.

Simply speaking, if we won in a one on one battle against Yang Ye, others would say it was normal. Because he was the Ying Clan’s patriarch and a 5th stage True Realm expert. So, wasn’t it normal to defeat a Zenith Realm expert? But what if he lost?

Not to mention losing, just being equally matched in battle would be an embarrassment for him!

So, why would he fight Yang Ye in single combat!

As for being embarrassed, so long as Yang Ye was dead, such an issue would cease to exist.

Yang Ye naturally didn’t attack. He turned around and vanished on the spot.

It was fast!

Absolutely fast! So fast that the others couldn’t even react!

Because Yang Ye had used Split Second to escape!

He had to!

No matter how strong he was, it was impossible for him to fight so many True Realm experts. It was impossible even if he used all his trump cards!

So, he’d decisively chosen to flee!

Everyone exchanged glances, and one of the old men spoke in a low voice, “He fled so quickly!”

Suddenly, Ying Qing took a deep breath and said, “Everyone, see that?”

Everyone gazed at Ying Qing.

Ying Qing said, “Yang Ye’s a sword cultivator, but there’s something terrifying about him. It’s that he’s not pedantic like other ordinary sword cultivators. We thought he was an idiot, a madman who doesn’t use his brains and is just courageous. However, is that really true?”

All of them fell silent.

Ying Qing continued, “He seems like an idiot who’s more brave than wise, but that’s not the case at all. He’s much smarter than we think.”

They nodded to display their agreement.

Since they started treating Yang Ye as their enemy, they’d gain a certain level of understanding of Yang Ye. Yang Ye was fond of acting unexpectedly. Most importantly, he didn’t care about honor.

Just like what he’d done moments ago. He’d decisively fled without the slightest hesitation!

Ying Qing was about to say something when all of them looked off into the distance because Yang Ye had suddenly appeared there.

He glanced at them, cracked a smile, and said, “I forgot something.”

A Sword Chest suddenly appeared in front of him.

They were still puzzled when a faint smile curled up on the corners of Yang Ye’s mouth. In an instant, six rays of light flashed out from the Sword Chest.

As soon as they appeared, the expressions of everyone here changed.

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!

Space in an area of 3km was instantly sliced into numerous pieces.

Two breaths of time later, everything returned to normal, and Yang Ye was gone.

Ying Qing and the others had extremely unsightly expressions on their faces. Because five of their companions were gone! They’d been sliced into pieces. Moreover, over 20 others were injured, and some were even heavily injured!

Lu Yuntian spoke solemnly, “That sword formation is really formidable!”𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Meanwhile, the Li Clan’s patriarch, Li Nianxian suddenly said, “Everyone, I think our previous way of thinking won’t work. Surrounding without attacking until the Yang Clan collapses…. Needless to say, it’s a very childish thought. Because we may collapse before the Yang Clan collapses.”

They nodded to display their agreement.

They would really collapse if Yang Ye came to attack them every single day!

Ying Qing fell silent for a moment, and then he glanced at the others, “Brother Li is right. I think we can’t delay any longer. We have to end it as soon as possible. But there’s a problem we must face, and that’s trust!”

They fell silent.

They were just an alliance formed at the last moment, so it wasn’t solid at all. All of them were very well aware that once the Yang Clan was crushed, the alliance would vanish. Because if it didn’t, then the Wu Clan and Ku Clan would ally with each other.

At that time, the clans would go to war, and no one could bear the consequences of that!

Meanwhile, Ying Qing said, “Everyone, I have a suggestion. Let’s dispatch five more True Realm experts each, and then crush the Yang Clan. Let’s stop holding back, alright?”

Five more True Realm experts each!

Coupled with the 45 here, it would be 70 True Realm experts!

Almost 7 times more True Realm experts than the Yang Clan!

Even though it couldn’t be considered as sending out all their forces, it could be described as not holding back at all.

All of them fell silent.

They hadn’t expected the situation to develop to such an extent. Just a single clan that had even been weakened through internal strife required so many experts to crush. Dispatching so many experts was a risk.

Besides the danger they faced from the Yang Clan, the Ku Clan and Wu Clan were part of that risk. Besides that, the mysterious existence in Moment Mountain was another part of it!

Meanwhile, Ying Qing suddenly said, “Do you want to let Yang Ye and Yang Lianshuang grow?”

Their expressions changed when they heard Ying Qing.

Based on their relationship with Yang Ye and Yang Lianshuang, if the two of them were allowed to grow, then all of them would definitely suffer. No, it should be said that if Yang Ye and Yang Lianshuang were allowed to catch their breath and regroup, then their joint forces would be sufficient to crush any clan!

Lu Yuntian suddenly said, “I agree!”

Everyone gazed at Lu Yuntian, and the latter spoke in a low voice, “Brother Ying Qing is right. We can’t be hesitant and worry too much. Since our relationship with the Yang Clan is at such a point, we have to annihilate them. Especially Yang Ye and Yang Lianshuang, we can’t allow them to grow. Otherwise, they’ll become nightmares for us!”

The Wang Clan’s patriarch, Wang Gu, expressed his opinion, “My Wang Clan agrees!”

“My Qin Clan agrees….”

It didn’t take long for the patriarchs to nod and display their agreement.

Ying Qing grinned. He looked down at Heaven Void Continent and said, “We’ll attack tomorrow!”

Meanwhile, Lu Yuntian suddenly said, “Right, I received news that many withdrew from the Yang Clan. What should we do about them?”

“Kill them, of course!” Ying Qing spoke indifferently, “Weeds should be pulled out by the roots. So, members of the Yang Clan should vanish from this world!”

A fierce smile curled up on the corners of his mouth, “Isn’t Yang Ye really ruthless? Chop off all their heads and send them to Heaven Void Continent.”

He naturally hated Yang Ye to the bone. Because what Yang Ye had done on Heaven Desolation Continent was an absolute humiliation for the Ying Clan, and it could only be washed away with the heads of countless and Yang Ye’s own head.

The others had no objection towards Ying Qing’s suggestion.

In just six hours, over 200 heads rained down on Phecda City.

All of them belonged to the experts who’d withdrawn from the Yang Clan. Even though only around a dozen True Realm experts had withdrawn from the Yang Clan that day, they hadn’t left alone. They’d taken their loved ones with them.

Yet now, all of their heads were raining down in front of Phecda Hall.

These heads shocked the entire city!

At this moment, countless members of the Yang Clan were outside Phecda Hall. All of them were looking at the heads. Some of those heads still had their eyes open, and their eyes were filled with terror. Obviously, they’d experienced something horrifying before they died.

Yang Lianshuang stood at the entrance of the hall with her hands behind her back. Her eyes were closed, and she remained silent.

Yang Ye, who stood beside her, remained silent too.

Everyone here was silent.

Take pleasure in their misfortune?

No one here did that. Even though all of them had left the Yang Clan when the clan needed them and all the people here had hated them, now…. All the people here only felt pity, sadness, and despair!

The heads before them told them that the five clans would never spare them.

Even if they withdrew from the Yang Clan, those five clans would still not let them go!

The five clans wanted to annihilate the Yang Clan!

It was a battle with annihilation at stake!

Yang Ye looked down slightly. He didn’t feel any hate towards them, but he didn’t have a good impression of them as well.

He looked down on those who could only share in the joys but not the sufferings of a clan or group.

But at this moment, these heads allowed him to understand that once they lost, it was obvious what would happen to the Yang Clan. It was obvious what would happen to Su Qingshi, Xue’er, and the others.

The Ying Clan and the other five clans would absolutely not let any of them live!

He couldn’t lose, and he couldn’t afford to lose either!

Suddenly, Yang Lianshuang looked up at the sky, “A debt of blood must be repaid with blood!”

A debt of blood must be repaid with blood!
