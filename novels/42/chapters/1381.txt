Chapter 1382 – Heavenrend Always Kills Its Target!

Now that’s embarrassing! Yang Ye’s face twitched slightly, and then he turned and looked towards the teleportation formation. He saw a woman walking out slowly from there. She wore a tight black dress, so it vividly revealed her curves. Especially the huge lumps on her chest. Her dress held tightly to them and made them seem like iron balls. Even though her skin wasn’t exposed at all, it made others have the urge to rush over and grab them.

Her appearance couldn’t be described as drop dead gorgeous, but it was very charming. Especially her huge eyes, they seem capable of sucking others in, and they made others unable to resist from taking a few more glances at them.

Yang Ye was naturally not interested in admiring her. He was thinking about what he should do. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

He didn’t recognize her, but he had no doubt that she was definitely here for the permit. Since she was able to immediately see through the state he was in, it was sufficient to prove how strong she was.

Fight them?

One against six?

If he could draw his sword 6 more times, he would definitely do that. However, not to mention drawing it again, even walking would be a problem if this went on for a while longer. Moreover, more and more would definitely be rushing over, and all of them would definitely possess some level of ability.

Obviously, they wouldn’t let him live.

He was worth 5 permits!

His head was much more valuable than Nether Maiden and the others!

Moreover, he was weak right now. So, could anyone resist such temptation?

“You aren’t drawing your sword?” Meanwhile, the woman suddenly smiled, and then she gazed at Hua Tianyuan, “He doesn’t have any profound energy left. Moreover, if I’m not wrong, he’s just standing on sheer willpower. He’ll definitely die if you attack. 5 permits are right in front of you. If you don’t want it, then I’ll take it.”

Hua Tianyuan and the others gazed at her with vigilance.

They didn’t recognize her, but they didn’t dare to look down on her. There were countless experts in the world, and the consequence of underestimating anyone might be death. It was something they’d understood a very long time ago.

The woman in a black dress suddenly grinned, “What, you dare not take it?”

Hua Tianyuan laughed coldly, “What a plan! You want us to test him and see if he has other trump cards, and then you can reap the rewards. Needless to say, it’s a really good plan.”

Perhaps Yang Ye really was just holding on with sheer willpower. However, could anyone guarantee that he had no other trump cards? Moreover, what if he wasn’t? What if he could still draw his sword? It wasn’t completely impossible. Because he’d been observing Yang Ye, and Yang Ye was too calm. It felt like Yang Ye was completely without any fear!

It was very understandable that both Hua Tianyuan’s group and the woman didn’t dare to rashly attack Yang Ye.

If Yang Ye was an ordinary person, then would someone in the large world pay such a high price for his head?

No matter how precious a permit was, they had to be alive to use it!

Her expression didn’t change at all when Hua Tianyuan exposed her intentions, and she just chuckled, “Since you refuse to act, then his head belongs to me, Lian Suyao.”

“Lian Suyao!” Hua Tianyuan and the others’ expressions changed. Hua Tianyuan stared fixedly at her and said, “You’re that Lian Suyao who killed 3 Semi-Deities within 100 breaths of time?!”

A smile curled up on the corners of her mouth, “You’ve heard of me?”

Hua Tianyuan and the others became vigilant when they heard her admit it.

There were thousands of worlds. While a genius could reign supreme in his or her own world, that same genius might be nothing when placed in the outside world. Only those whose names were known by other geniuses were the true experts. Obviously, Lian Suyao was such a person. The reason she was famous was because she’d fought 3 Semi-Deities on her own, and all 3 of them died in battle.

Moreover, it had taken less than 100 breaths of time!

She’d made a name for herself through that battle.

Even though there were 5 of them in Hua Tianyuan’s group, they didn’t dare act carelessly at all when facing such a monstrous genius. However, they didn’t fear her as well. They weren’t newbies. Perhaps they couldn’t defeat her in single combat, but if they joined forces, then she would definitely have to fear them. Otherwise, she wouldn’t have tried to use such schemes and would have just asked them to fuck off.

Yang Ye had a gloomy expression on his face, or it should be described as being quite unsightly instead. He felt that he had really bad luck. He’d just come here to send them off, yet he’d trapped himself here instead. One after the other were arriving here, and each was stronger than the last. Perhaps, someone else would arrive just a while later, and then that person would look for trouble with him as well. Actually, there was no need to wait for later, that woman called Lian Suyao intended to look for trouble with him as well.

Lian Suyao walked slowly in Yang Ye’s direction and smiled, “They’re paying such a huge price for your head. I’m really quite curious. Why is your head so valuable? Is it made from divine crystals?”

Yang Ye spoke indifferently, “You want it?”

Lian Suyao chuckled, “Don’t act so calm. I’m no scaredy cat. I would really have to be fearful if you were at your prime. But I can fight 10 of you if you’re in your current state!”

As soon as she finished speaking, her figure suddenly became translucent, and then countless fine needle shaped rays of light flashed out from the space around Yang Ye. After that, they shot towards Yang Ye.

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly while ferocity appeared in them. The tiny vortex revolved within him. However, Yang Ye suddenly seemed stunned, and then he relaxed.

Bang!

Numerous explosions resounded. Around 10 breaths of time passed before all the rays of light vanished, and then Yang Ye appeared before them.

Yang Ye was completely unharmed!

Lian Suyao, Hua Tianyuan, and the others’ faces had become gloomy because someone had assisted Yang Ye.

Who was it?

Lian Suyao and the others didn’t know, but Yang Ye did. It was Boundary Maiden whom he’d met once in the past. A barrier had appeared around him when he was about to attack!

She was here, but she hadn’t shown herself.

“Get the fuck out here!” Suddenly, Lian Suyao’s face became cold, and she stretched out her hand. In an instant, the space in an area of over 5km rippled violently, but it only took an instant for the rippling space here to calm down.

A fierce gaze flashed through Lian Suyao’s eyes as she raised her palm before pressing it down, “Shatter!”

Bang!

A loud explosion resounded as the space in an area of 30km collapsed, causing pitch black darkness to instantly cover the surroundings. After that, numerous explosions resounded from within the black hole.

Around a few breaths of time later, the space here was repaired.

Yang Ye appeared before them, and there was a woman in a green dress by his side.

She was naturally Boundary Maiden.

“The Nether Pavilion!” A cold smile curled up on the corners of Lian Suyao’s lips, “I knew this assignment wouldn’t be easy. As expected, just one of the hall masters is already so strong. If all the other hall masters are here.... Tsk, tsk....”

As she spoke, she was frequently sizing up the surroundings and seemed rather vigilant. Obviously, she was afraid that more hall masters of the Nether Pavilion had come.

Boundary Maiden paid no attention to Lian Suyao and just gazed at Yang Ye instead, “Why didn’t you leave?”

She’d helped him earlier so that he could leave, but Yang Ye hadn’t.

Yang Ye shook his head, “I can’t leave you here by yourself!”

Boundary Maiden was slightly stunned, and then she sized him up and said, “Your profound energy has dried up and your physical strength has been exhausted beyond its limits. So you can’t leave!”

Even with how thick-skinned Yang Ye was, his face couldn’t help but turn red when she exposed him like that. He had wanted to leave, but just as she’s said, he couldn’t anymore. If he didn’t possess shocking willpower, he wouldn’t even have the ability to stand, right now.

Heavenrend always killed its target!

However, the consumption that accompanied it wasn’t something he couldn’t really endure!

The situation here was in a stalemate. Lian Suyao seemed to be worried about something and didn’t attack, and it was the same for Hua Tianyuan’s group. At this moment, they’d witnessed how terrifying a hall master of the Nether Pavilion was, and they’d truly stopped underestimating their opponents now. Moreover, they were also worried that Lian Suyao would act against them.

As for Lian Suyao, she was actually vigilant against Hua Tianyuan’s group as well. She wouldn’t fear any one of them in single combat, but they were in a group.

Their strengths weren’t the slightest bit weaker to 5 Semi-Deities!

It was exactly because they were apprehensive about each other that none of them attacked.

Yang Ye asked, “Only you came?” Yang Ye had naturally asked this question via voice transmission.

Boundary Maiden replied, “What do you think?” She’d replied via voice transmission as well.

Yang Ye was astounded, “They have so many on their side, yet they made you come alone?”

“You’re mistaken!” She continued, “I didn’t come here from the Radiant Dimension. I was rushing back from somewhere else and just happened to bump into you, so I lent you a hand. They are in the Radiant Dimension, so they are utterly unaware that we’ve encountered enemies here.”

Yang Ye was stunned, and he was stunned for a long time before he gulped, “Nether Maiden and the others don’t know that we’re in trouble. In other words, it’s the 2 of us against the 6 of them?”

She spoke indifferently, “It’s 1 against the 6 of them!”

Yang Ye asked, “You’re going to fight them on your own?”

She glanced at him and replied, “You’re going to fight them. I’m going to run.”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

Suddenly, Lian Suyao gazed at Hua Tianyuan and said, “If we continue being apprehensive of each other, then it’ll definitely result in 2 types of outcomes. The first is that they flee, and the second is that they keep us busy until more arrive. Regardless of which outcome it is, it isn’t beneficial to any of us. So, I think we can join forces and deal with them first. As for how we’ll split the rewards, we can discuss it later. What do you think?”

Yang Ye’s eyelids twitched when he heard her. She really is quite arrogant. She actually didn’t even use a voice transmission when saying such things.

After all, that was a form of contempt towards Yang Ye and Boundary Maiden!

Boundary Maiden’s face was calm and completely composed.

Meanwhile, Hua Tianyuan remained silent for a few breaths of time, and then he nodded, “Alright.” Actually, Lian Suyao had said exactly what he wanted to say.

When she heard him agree, Lian Suyao immediately said, “Attack!”

As soon as she gave the word, her figure vanished on the spot.

“Yang Ye is weak! Take his head first!” Hua Tianyuan’s voice resounded in the minds of the other 4 in his group, and then they charged towards Boundary Maiden and Yang Ye.
