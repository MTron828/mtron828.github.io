Chapter 2493 – I’m Very Strong!

Was it good? Or bad?

As far as Yang Ye was concerned, it was definitely bad for Eternal Kingdom. They were unaware of the desolate race’s true strength. While it made them very confident, they would have an absolute nightmare when they really faced the desolate race!

As for Yang Ye himself, it was a good thing!

He didn’t have a good impression of Eternal Kingdom at all. After all, it was ceaselessly targeting him and Snowy.

So, he would definitely choose the desolate race when faced with a choice between the desolate race and Eternal Kingdom!

Meanwhile, Mo Ya sized up Yang Ye and asked, “Do you think the desolate race is very terrifying?”

Yang Ye shook his head and smiled, “Forget that. I was just asking. You don’t mind, right?”

Mo Ya didn’t say anything.

Meanwhile, a ray of light appeared in the sky. It didn’t take long for it to descend before them, and then it dispersed to reveal a young man in a black robe.

The young man glanced at them and asked, “The Ancient Sword Sect?”

Tie Yuan stepped forward and cupped his fist, “We are inner court disciples of the Ancient Sword Sect!”

The young man frowned slightly, “Why are you so weak?”

The expressions of the disciples from the Ancient Sword Sect became quite unsightly.

It was quite a slap to their faces!

The young man ignored the change in their expressions and added, “I thought the sword cultivators of the Ancient Sword Sect would be pretty good, but I didn’t expect the strongest to be merely at the Three World Realm, and there’s even one who just attained the Limitbreaker Realm. Do you think you’re here to tour around and have fun?”

Tie Yuan spoke solemnly, “While we aren’t extraordinarily monstrous geniuses, we're naturally not much weaker!”

“Is that so?” The young man laughed coldly, “Allow me to be honest, all of you are terrible!”

The faces of the others turned gloomy when they heard this. It was a direct slap to the face!

Tie Yuan looked up at the young man and spoke coldly, “I may not be very strong, but I’d like to seek guidance from you!”

If they could endure this, then the Ancient Sword Sect would become the laughingstock of the entire Eternal Kingdom.

“Guidance from me?” The young man laughed coldly, “To be honest, I don’t really want to play with all of you. However, since you want to play, then let’s play. It’ll at least give you a chance to realize how much you’re lacking.”

Tie Yuan drew the huge iron sword on his back, grabbed it with both hands, and stared at the young man. A moment later, his sword left his grasp and shot up into the air.

It was a direct and aggressive attack!

That was the impression it gave everyone.

But it didn’t take long for their expressions to change because the young man had grabbed the tip of the huge iron sword with just one hand!

The sword was still trembling, yet it couldn’t move an inch, even when held by a single hand!

Viciousness flashed through Tie Yuan’s eyes, and then he leaped over to the sword. At the same time, countless strands of sword energy shot down at the young man like a storm.

At this moment, the entire sky was covered in sword energy!

It was flashy, but it wasn’t strong!

Yang Ye shook his head. They may seem like a huge storm, but they were very, very weak. They just made for a nice show.

Sure enough, the young man slammed a punch forward, and a wave of powerful energy rippled out and obliterated the sword energy while Tie Yuan was blasted away. Once he landed on the ground, Tie Yuan was pushed another 300m back before he finally stopped himself, and there was blood on the corner of his mouth.

The young man held the huge sword in his grasp and laughed coldly, “A sword cultivator? I have to admit that there are many powerful sword cultivators in this world, but to be honest, all of you are very weak. You’re not suited for the War Dimension!”

He flicked his finger once he finished speaking.

The iron sword shook violently and transformed into a ray of light that shot explosively at Tie Yuan.

Everywhere it passed, it left a long mark in space, clearly displaying how powerful it was!

Tie Yuan’s pupils constricted, and he seemed like he was facing a formidable enemy. The young man was too strong, and if he couldn’t stop the sword, then he would be severely injured even if he could avoid death!

Tie Yuan was about to act when a man appeared in front of him. After that, the man stopped the iron sword with one hand!

It was Yang Ye!

The iron sword was motionless in Yang Ye’s grasp!

Everyone gazed at Yang Ye. Mo Ya’s gaze flickered as she gazed at Yang Ye, and no one knew what she was thinking.

Yang Ye glanced at the sword, and then passed it to Tie Yuan. The latter glanced at him and said, “Thank you!”

Yang Ye smiled, “It’s nothing!”

Tie Yuan may not be very strong, but he’d dared to step forward just now, so he was no coward, and Yang Ye was willing to help people like this!

The young man sized up Yang Ye and said, “A body cultivator!”

Yang Ye gazed at the young man and nodded, “Sort of.”

The young man asked, “Shall we spar?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “I just want to say a few words. I think it’s quite prejudiced to think that all of us have no right to enter the War Dimension. How about you let us give it a try? If we’re really too weak, we will naturally give up. No one will try to do something beyond their ability, right?”

The young man shook his head slightly, “To be honest, your strength really isn’t sufficient. Ask the elite disciples of your sect to come give it a try instead. Besides that, even though we are only recruiting a reserve force, there is still a minimum requirement. Unfortunately, all of you aren’t there yet!”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and asked, “What’s the minimum requirement?”

The young man pointed at himself, “I’m one of the weakest. Defeat me or fight me equally, and you can enter.”

The others had quite unsightly expressions on their faces when they heard this.

The young man was at least at the Four World Realm, and he was clearly one who had relied on himself to attain such strength!

But the strongest among them, Tie Yuan, had lost! He’d lost without the slightest chance at victory!

Defeating the young man was the requirement!

Yang Ye fell silent for a few moments and gazed at the others, “Does anyone want to try?”

The young man had spoken very arrogantly, but it didn’t represent that he was wrong. Since such a requirement had been set, achieving the requirement was their own problem.

All of them remained silent for a long time. In the end, a man stepped forward. It was Lu Yunxian.

Everyone gazed at him, and he looked up at the young man, “Let me try!”

As soon as he finished speaking, a sword appeared in his grasp, and then a ray of sword energy shot up into the air!

It was extremely fast and powerful! It was a very pure ray of sword energy!

It was stronger than Tie Yuan’s sword energy!

Much stronger!

Yang Ye nodded slightly. Needless to say, Lu Yunxian’s strength wasn’t bad at all. His sword energy was very sharp and pure, and it was much better than Tie Yuan.Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

The young man spoke indifferently, “This is a little better.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he tapped his finger forward like he was putting down a Go piece. The space there shook, and then ripples undulated through space toward the sword energy!

It was extremely powerful!

The sword energy was forced to a stop in midair. Moreover, every single wave that slammed against the sword energy made it dim down slightly, and the 5th wave obliterated the sword energy!

Meanwhile, a sword suddenly appeared before the young man and shot straight for his forehead.

It was swift like a bolt of lightning and at an extremely tricky angle!

He’d chosen close-quartered combat!

A cold smile curled up on the corners of the young man’s mouth, “Close-quartered combat! I’ve never feared anyone in the same realm of cultivation!”

He slammed his fist forward once he finished speaking, and a wave of powerful fist intent rippled out like a torrent, causing space to shake violently!

Suddenly, Lu Yunxian’s eyes narrowed slightly, and then he shook his right hand.

A resounding sword howl surged through the area, and then fine hair thin threads of sword energy shot out from the tip of his sword. These threads of sword energy pierced through the young man’s attack and enveloped him.

A moment of silence ensued.

Boom!

The sky shook violently as a wave of powerful energy rippled through the sky. The energy pushed Lu Yunxian around 300m back. But it didn’t take long for a ray of powerful sword energy to flash through the sky and push the young man around 100m back!

A short while later, the sky gradually calmed down!

The young man had a slight advantage in the battle!

The young man didn’t attack again. He glanced at Lu Yunxian and said, “Very pure sword energy with pretty good strength. You barely pass.”

Lu Yunxian cupped his fist at the young man, glanced at Yang Ye, and moved aside!

The young man glanced at the others on the ground below and said, “The War Dimension is more brutal than you’ve ever imagined. This isn’t a place of ease and comfort, it’s the most dangerous place in Eternal Kingdom. Don’t treat this place as a platform to improve your strength. While it is one, it’s only limited to those who are strong and unafraid of death. Alright, I won’t say more. Does anyone else wish to stay? If there is, then step forward!”

He seemed to have thought of something at this point and gazed at Yang Ye, “I think you’re quite strong, so come try me.”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and replied, “Allow me to correct you. I’m not pretty strong, I’m very strong!”

Everyone here was stunned speechless.
