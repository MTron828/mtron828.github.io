Chapter 782 – The Invincible Sword Domain!

Translator: InVader

Editor: Conspiracing

“Sword Domain!” Yang Ye’s voice resounded!

As soon as Yang Ye’s voice resounded, the palms and fists stopped as if they were frozen in midair, and then the spatial walls around Yang Ye instantly vanished.

“Flight....” They immediately vanished once the Sword Spirit spoke that last word.

Supreme Exalt He and the others stared blankly ahead as they stood on the spot. After all, a Monarch Realm profounder had actually escaped from over a dozen experts who were high-grade Half-Saints!

“His aura is gone. He utilized the Sword Domain to conceal his aura. I can’t locate him!” A grey robed old man spoke solemnly.

“As expected of the Invincible Sword Domain!” Shen Mo said, “According to rumor, the Sword Sect’s Founding Ancestor relied on it to kill his way to the Outer Heavens, and he even crushed all obstacles before him throughout the Heavenpath. Now that I’ve witnessed its might today, it really is extraordinary. If he attains the Half-Saint Realm and fully grasps its profundities, then our joint forces would be helpless against him!”

“He won’t be able to grow to that extent!” Supreme Exalt He and a few experts of the Hallowed Halls vanished on the spot once he finished speaking.

Shen Mo shook his head, and then he turned around and left.

...

A few tens of thousands of kilometers away. Within a cave in a mountain.

“You....” The Sword Spirit, Ding Shaoyao, and Little Yao stared blankly at Yang Ye, and tears were streaming out of Little Yao’s eyes. At this moment, Yang Ye’s appearance had changed completely. His black hair was completely white, snow white. His face had even instantly aged countless years, and it was covered in wrinkles. Besides his eyes that were still filled with spirit, Yang Ye who stood before them seemed to have completely transformed into an old man.

“Big Brother....” Little Yao instantly wrapped her arms around him and just held him tightly while crying, “You... you.... Why do you look like this?” 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Yang Ye stretched out his hand to grab a strand of his hair, and a trace of bewilderment appeared in his eyes as he gazed at the snow white hair in his hand. He said, “Is this the price for forcefully utilizing the Laws of the Sword Domain?”

“Do you think that’s all?” Meanwhile, the Sword Spirit suddenly spoke angrily, “Do you know how long your lifespan is now? Two days. No, not even 2 days. The vitality within your body is gradually transforming into Death Energy now. In short, you’re finished!”

Two days!

Ding Shaoyao and Little Yao’s figures trembled when they heard this. Little Yao started crying even more while disbelief filled Ding Shaoyao’s eyes.

Yang Ye rubbed Little Yao’s head and said, “It’s fine. Don’t cry. Your big brother’s clothes are going to get drenched if you continue!”

However, Little Yao started crying even more loudly.

Yang Ye shook his head helplessly when he witnessed this.

Ding Shaoyao suddenly gazed at the Sword Spirit and said, “You definitely have a way to save him, right?”

“I don’t. This is the consequence of his own actions!” The Sword Spirit was still angry. She disapproved of Yang Ye’s intention to charge into the Hallowed Grounds. Sure enough, what she was worried about had happened. They’d almost died there. While they’d escaped now, the price Yang Ye paid was too great!

Ding Shaoyao walked over to the Sword Spirit and said, ‘It isn’t the time to throw a fit. There’s Death Energy within him, and he’ll definitely die if we don’t think of a way to deal with it. Moreover, you have to realize that we only have around a day of time left. Only a day!” Ding Shaoyao’s voice was trembling as she finished speaking.

The Sword Spirit took a deep breath and said, “He actually has no lifespan left. The reason he’s still alive is because of the profound energy within him. His profound energy has the ability to resist Death Energy, and that’s why he’s still able to live while he has no more lifespan. There’s only a single way to save him, and it’s to increase his lifespan. There are many ways to increase a person’s lifespan, like advancing in one’s cultivation, or treasures that can increase a person’s lifespan. I don’t think he can advance to the seventh rank of the Monarch Realm in a single day. As for treasures that increase the lifespan. There definitely are some in this world, but we don’t have enough time at all!”

“Treasures that increase lifespan?” Ding Shaoyao was stunned, and then she flipped her palm and the Greenwood Spirit appeared in her grasp. She said, “Will this work?”

“What pure vitality!” There was a trace of surprise in the Sword Spirit’s voice. She pondered deeply for a moment before she took it, and then she walked over to Yang Ye and slapped it onto his body,

Bang!

The Greenwood Spirit shattered, and then countless strands of dark green energy entered Yang Ye’s body.

The wrinkles on Yang Ye’s face gradually vanished, and his appearance returned to normal after 2 hours passed. However, his snow white hair hadn’t changed back to black.

“Why....” Ding Shaoyao gazed at the Sword Spirit with a questioning gaze.

The Sword Spirit explained, “The Greenwood Spirit contained vitality, and it really was capable of increasing a person’s lifespan. However, it was far from sufficient. Now, he can live for half a month. Moreover, there’s Death Energy within him. That Death Energy isn’t manmade Death Energy, it’s Death Energy formed from the supreme Laws of the Heaven Dao. So, if he isn’t able to increase his lifespan in this half a month of time, then he will still die!”

Ding Shaoyao turned to look at Yang Ye and said, “You’re confident in your ability to attain the seventh rank of the Monarch Realm in half a month, right?”

Yang Ye replied, “I can try!”

“Try?” The Sword Spirit spoke coldly, “You have a few dozen 1,000 year old Firecrystals, so you really can give it a try. But what if you fail? Or someone interrupts you? Or perhaps some other mishap occurs? At that time, even a god wouldn’t be able to save you. Understand?”

Yang Ye laughed bitterly and said, “Don’t get so agitated. Let's just talk nicely with each other!”

“Agitated!? She roared furiously, “I told you not to be rash and plan before your act. If you don’t change your character, then you’ll get yourself killed one day!”

Yang Ye said, “Do you know what would have happened to Shaoyao and Little Yao if I was a step too late? Even though I only have half a month of life now, it was all worth it to me. Because I’ve saved both of them!”

“Big Brother!” Little Yao buried her head in his chest and hugged him tightly.

Ding Shaoyao glanced at Yang Ye and remained silent.

The Sword Spirit fell silent as well.

Yang Ye continued, “No matter what, the outcome is a good one. Because I’m still alive, and both Little Yao and Shaoyao are still alive as well. Half a month is entirely sufficient for me. Because my foundation isn’t weak, and I have that many 1,000 year old Firecrystals. Even if I have to pile them up within me to gain enough energy, I’ll do it until I attain the seventh rank of the Monarch Realm!”

The Sword Spirit gazed at him for a long time, and then she suddenly said angrily, “What are you still looking at me for? Am I that nice to look at? Quickly go and cultivate!”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

For the sake of his survival, Yang Ye cultivated more desperately than he ever had. He immediately placed 10 1,000 year old Fire Crystals before himself and swallowed 2 more 1,000 year old Firecrystals.

As soon as they entered his body, countless strands of pure energy instantly swept through his body, and Yang Ye hurriedly focused his mind.

“Come with me for a while!” The Sword Spirit suddenly spoke to Ding Shaoyao.

Ding Shaoyao was slightly stunned, and then she walked out of the cave with the Sword Spirit.

After they moved a little bit away from the cave, the Sword Spirit suddenly attacked, and a few dozen rays of sword energy enveloped Ding Shaoyao. Ding Shaoyao was stunned again, and her eyes were filled with bewilderment.

“Who exactly are you!?” The Sword Spirit spoke in a low voice.

“What do you mean?” A bewildered expression still remained in Ding Shaoyao’s eyes.

The Sword Spirit replied, “You can deceive Yang Ye and even everyone else, but you can’t deceive me. There’s an extremely terrifying force within you, and it doesn’t belong to this world. Moreover, you should have noticed Yang Ye in the hall earlier, right? So, who exactly are you? Why exactly are you staying by Yang Ye’s side!?”

The bewilderment in Ding Shaoyao’s eyes vanished. She gazed at the Sword Spirit for a long time before she said, “Is that important?”

The Sword Spirit laughed coldly and said, “Of course it is. Yang Ye is a fool and a pervert. He’s easily charmed by women. You clearly possess formidable strength yet you’re acting like a weaking and staying by his side. That’s truly unbelievable to me. Don’t tell me it’s because you love him. No one would believe that!”

Ding Shaoyao suddenly turned around and gazed at the cave that Yang Ye was cultivating in. A short while passed before she said, “I’ve never harmed him. Of course, I might not even be able to with the strength he possesses!”

“Then why are you concealing your strength? Why are you staying by his side?” asked the Sword Spirit.

Ding Shaoyao said, “Concealing my strength? I didn’t. I can use that strength, but if I do, then I might not be myself in the future. Indeed, I would become very strong, but so what? I wouldn’t be myself anymore. So, what’s the point of becoming strong?”

When she spoke up to this point, she gazed at the Sword Spirit and continued, “You should have experienced such a feeling. The Sword Spirit of the past was close to Yang Ye, but the true you isn’t However, if I’m not wrong, since you’ve fused into one with the Sword Spirit of the past, you should have some of her emotions and feelings, right?”

The Sword Spirit answered, “You’re right. The reason I’m staying with him is mostly because of the past ‘me’. But so what?”

“You should have really hated Yang Ye in the beginning, right?” said Ding Shaoyao.

The Sword Spirit replied, “He said you are very smart. Now, I believe him!”

Ding Shaoyao chuckled, “No matter what, I know that you have no ill intent towards Yang Ye, and it doesn’t matter if it’s because of the old Sword Spirit or because of something else. As for me, all I can say is that we met by chance. Regardless of what happens in the future, I won’t harm him, just like you won’t!”

The Sword Spirit gazed at Ding Shaoyao for a long time, and she was about to speak when she suddenly looked up towards the sky and said, “Shit! Experts of the Hallowed Halls are coming!”
