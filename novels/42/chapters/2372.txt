Chapter 2373 – Erya’s Nature!

At this moment, Oxxy’s body had grown almost 300m tall, and he stood there like a mountain with a huge axe in his grasp.

The Primordial Axe of Creation!

After Oxxy attained the World Lord Realm, and its aura was terrifyingly strong too. But after it held the axe in its grasp, its aura was absolutely terrifying.

The Primal Dragon Croc’s gaze was unprecedentedly solemn.

At this moment, it felt threatened!

Suddenly, Oxxy raised the Primordial Axe of Creation and chopped down at it.

A huge pitch black spatial rift appeared in the sky.

It had been chopped open by the Primordial Axe of Creation!

The rift seemed like a shocking hole in the sky.

The seriousness in the Primal Dragon Croc’s eyes grew even denser.

It didn’t dare act carelessly. It spun rapidly in midair, and its long dragon tail swept at Oxxy and the axe.

The entire sky rippled before it!

It was a true Limitbreaker Realm demon!

Yang Ye and Nanli Meng watched as the axe slammed against the tail.

Bang!

The Primal Dragon Croc was slammed down to the swamp. In the end, it smashed into the swap and made the swap water surge up from the impact.

Snowy’s eyes lit up from the sight of this.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye and Nanli Meng exchanged glances, and there was a trace of solemness in their eyes.

Oxxy’s strength was a little terrifying!

Oxxy excelled in physical strength, and coupled with the Primordial Axe of Creation, it could be said to be a union of strength!

As for the Primal Dragon Croc, even if Oxxy had risen to a higher realm of cultivation, Oxxy was still no match for the Primal Dragon Croc in a pure collision of strength. It should be said that Oxxy’s bloodline couldn’t compare to it. While bloodline couldn’t decide everything, it was extremely important. Yet now, Oxxy had a Divine Treasure while the Primal Dragon Croc didn’t!

Demons competed with equipment too!

Oxxy returned to its original form. It walked over to Snowy and passed the axe to Snowy.

Snowy took it, grinned, and then patted Oxxy on the shoulder. It could be considered as praising Oxxy.

Meanwhile, Erya was still licking her tanghulu, and then she passed it to Snowy.

Yang Ye moved his gaze away from Oxxy and looked at the swamp below. At this moment, it had returned to normal, and the Primal Dragon Croc didn’t show any further signs of movement.

Yang Ye gazed at the swamp and seemed to be lost in thought.

Meanwhile, Snowy inhaled lightly. In an instant, the spirit energy within the swamp surged, and then it surged toward Snowy like a torrent!

Nanli Meng glanced at Snowy with slight fear in her eyes.

Snowy was extracting the spirit energy here, and she was doing it like she was taking water from it!

Bang!

A colossus shot up from within the swamp!

It was the Primal Dragon Croc!

It stared at Yang Ye’s group with a vicious glow in its eyes.

After all, taking the spirit energy here was like taking its life!

Meanwhile, Snowy passed the axe to Oxxy. The Primal Dragon Croc’s vicious gaze turned to a fearful one from the sight of this, and then it gazed at Snowy. At this moment, Yang Ye had stopped concealing Snowy’s aura with the Sword Domain.

The Primal Dragon Croc was stunned by the sight of Snowy, and then disbelief appeared in its eyes, “A Sprite… Impossible…”

Yang Ye glanced at it. Obviously, it had recognized Snowy.

Snowy was about to wave her claw when Yang Ye shook his head and walked away with her.

The Primal Dragon Croc was stunned and wanted to chase after them. However, Oxxy obstructed its path, and Oxxy was holding the Primordial Axe of Creation!

Oxxy’s face was calm, but its aura was extremely powerful.

Erya walked over to Oxxy and stretched out her hand. Oxxy obediently passed her the axe, and the latter nodded as she gazed at it, “A good axe indeed!”

Oxxy was at a loss for words.

Erya licked her tanghulu and gazed at the crocodile, “Madman Yang… Oh, I mean Big Brother Yang asked me to tell you that if you’re willing to go with him, then he’ll take you out of this battlefield. He’ll even give you a mountain at the rear mountains of the Sword Sect, it’ll be a huge mountain too.”

The Primal Dragon Croc glanced at Yang Ye’s vanishing figure and spoke with disdain, “Follow him? An ant at the True Void Realm? He isn’t worthy!”

Wang Erya suddenly stopped licking her tanghulu and gazed at the crocodile. She pointed the axe at it and said, “Big Guy, if you let Snowy hear that, you’re dead. You’re absolutely dead!”

She gazed at Oxxy and asked, “Oxxy, I’m not lying, right?”

Oxxy hurriedly nodded.

Oxxy wasn’t trying to curry favor with Erya, it was because they really couldn’t afford to offend Yang Ye.

Both Erya and Snowy, such lawless little fellows, would immediately become obedient when Yang Ye was serious.

The Primal Dragon Croc spoke with disdain, “I can crush him like an ant!”

Wang Erya shook her head and passed the axe to Oxxy, “Let’s go. This big guy’s an idiot!”

Oxxy glanced at the crocodile and nodded to display its agreement.

The spirit energy in the Primordial Pagoda was much, much better than this place.

“Wait!” Suddenly, the Primal Dragon Croc spoke, “Was that a Sprite Progenitor?”

Oxxy glanced at Erya, and the latter didn’t turn around. So, it naturally didn’t turn around, and they just walked off.

It had been ignored!

This infuriated the Primal Dragon Croc, and viciousness surged into its eyes while a wave of powerful pressure swept out from it.

Suddenly, Wang Erya stopped. She put the tanghulu in her mouth and took the axe from Oxxy, and then she hurled it at the crocodile.

Hiss!

It tore through the air!

The crocodile’s expression changed drastically, and it swept its long tail at the axe.

Bang!

As soon as they collided, the crocodile was blasted over 3km away, and countless scales cracked open on its tail. Besides that, the axe was still on its tail. The axe had cut into its flesh!

The Primal Dragon Croc gazed at her with astonishment, “You…”

Wang Erya licked her tanghulu and said, “Give the axe back to me.”

The crocodile was furious when it heard this, and its desire to kill seemed simply material. Suddenly, Wang Erya licked her tanghulu and said, “Why must a lowly demon like you be so arrogant?”

“How dare you!” It howled furiously, and then it charged at her.

It was like a towering mountain pressing down upon her!

Oxxy’s expression changed as it clenched its fist tightly. It was about to attack when Wang Erya suddenly pulled Oxxy behind her, and then she gazed at the charging crocodile. Suddenly, a strange smile arose on her face, and then she licked her lips before opening her mouth.

Time froze.

Oxxy watched as the crocodile started to shrink, and it grew smaller as it grew closer to Wang Erya.

There was despair in its eyes!

Besides despair, there was terror!

Bloodline suppression!

Actually, at its level of strength, besides the bloodline of its ancestors, even the bloodline of a Primal True Dragon couldn’t suppress it. At the very most, a Primal True Dragon could deter and pressure it, but at this moment, its bloodline was being completely and utterly suppressed!

The strength and ability of demon beasts actually came from their bloodline, but at this moment, its bloodline was being suppressed, so it was rendered helpless!

The Primal Dragon Croc was still growing smaller, and it was the size of a tanghulu when it arrived before Erya.

Erya inhaled lightly and sucked it into her mouth.

She burped, and her stomach seemed to bulge a little, but it only took a moment for her to return to normal. She patted her stomach, and then a moment passed before she spat out an axe.

The Primordial Axe of Creation!

Oxxy was stunned by this.Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

It had been eaten!

The Primal Dragon Croc had been eaten by Erya!

Oxxy was quite nervous.

Meanwhile, she passed the axe to Oxxy, and the latter took it with slightly trembling hands.

Erya patted Oxxy on the shoulder, “Let’s go!”

She pranced off into the distance.

Oxxy wiped off the sweat on its face and hurriedly followed after her.

Two hours later, Yang Ye’s group left the swamp, and there was a pure white pearl in his grasp.

It was the inner core of the Primal Dragon Croc. Erya had given it to him because she said it was useful for him.

The Primal Dragon Croc was dead!

Yang Ye didn’t ask how it died. Because Erya would just brush his question off, and Oxxy would lower its head as if it was begging him not to ask it.

Yang Ye didn’t pursue an answer. He wanted help, but it was too vicious. He didn’t like demon beasts like that, and he didn’t like such demon beasts staying by Snowy’s side.

Actually, it could have lived, and Yang Ye had never thought of killing it. Unfortunately, it didn’t know how to act and challenged Erya.

Suddenly, Nanli Meng stopped. Yang Ye was dragged back from his thoughts as well. He looked into the distance, and then his expression changed drastically while both he and Nanli Meng couldn’t help but move backwards swiftly.
