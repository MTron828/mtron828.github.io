Chapter 2086 – Woman in a White Dress!

The surroundings instantly fell silent.

Someone was here to cause trouble.

Meanwhile, the old man’s eyes narrowed slightly and were filled with icy coldness.

A middle aged man started walking slowly towards the round platform.

At this moment, everyone’s gazes converged on him.

Finally, the middle aged man arrived on the platform. He ignored the old man and gazed at Elysium instead. There were complicated emotions in his eyes, “Time changes everything.”

The old man suddenly said, “Don’t you know this is the Immortal Treasure Pavilion?”

The middle aged man didn’t even turn around as he said, “Did someone make you auction this, or did you get this yourself?”

The old man slowly clenched his fists, “It seems you really are…”

Suddenly, the middle aged man turned around, and then a huge axe appeared in his grasp. He took it in both hands and swung it.

Bang!

The entire auction house was instantly obliterated.

Countless people fled towards the surroundings.

The might of a Sage!

This attack hadn’t just destroyed the auction house, it had alarmed the entire city. The city naturally had its own management. After all, there were rules in the city, and since there were rules, someone naturally had to uphold the rules.

So, as soon as the middle aged man attacked, a voluptuous woman had arrived in the sky above the auction house. She glanced at the old man from the auction house and asked, “Elder Li, what’s going on?”

Elder Li gazed at the middle aged man and said, “You should ask him!”

The beautiful woman gazed at the middla aged man, but the latter ignored her, and he just walked towards Elder Li, “One last chance. Did someone else put this up for auction, or did your Immortal Treasure Pavilion get it yourself?”

“I…” The woman wanted to say something, but the middle aged man turned around and swung his axe.

Hiss!

The sound of space being torn apart resounded.

Bang!

The woman was blasted over 1km away.

The middle aged man glanced at her and said, “Private business. Interfere again and die!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he turned around and gazed at the old man, “Where’s your headquarters?”

Their headquarters!

At this moment, a solemn expression finally appeared on the old man’s face. He knew that the middle aged man wasn’t just here to cause trouble, and the middle aged man’s background was definitely extremely great. Otherwise, the middle aged man wouldn’t dare to cause trouble in Cosmic Star City or go to Immortal Treasure Pavilion’s headquarters.

The old man calmed himself when he thought up to this point and said, “My Immortal Treasure Pavilion may not be a big organization, but it isn’t…”

The middle aged man didn’t say anything and just vanished on the spot.

Bang!

A wave of terrifying energy erupted in the city, and the entire city trembled.

The beautiful woman’s face fell. She was about to act when a divine sense locked onto her. Her expression changed upon sensing it and turned around. But right at this moment, the scene around her changed. She was in an expanse of the starry sky, and countless stars and space resided above her.

She slowly clenched her fists and was about to attack. However, the stars above her suddenly trembled, and then they moved swiftly. As soon as that happened, a wave of mysterious energy appeared above the woman.

She gazed up for quite some time. Suddenly, her pupils constricted, and she spoke with disbelief, “Moving the stars! The god race… You’re from the god race…”

Meanwhile, endless starlight descended, and her voice stopped abruptly.

Three breaths of time later, her figure fell slowly from the sky while starlight flickered around her.

Elder Li’s expression became extremely unsightly from the sight of this. At this moment, he truly understood that he’d far underestimated the power which stood behind the middle aged man.

When he saw the middle aged man was about to attack again, Elder Li hurriedly said, “It doesn’t belong to my Immortal Treasure Pavilion, and it was given to us by someone else.”

The middle aged man stopped and asked, “Who?”

The old man was slightly hesitant.

“Kill him.” Suddenly, a voice resounded from the sky.

At this moment, the middle aged man didn’t hesitate to vanish on the spot, and the world instantly changed around them.

It darkened!

The entire world had darkened, and then a huge axe shot down like a meteor within the darkness.

Yang Ye had an extremely solemn expression on his face.

The dark world around them wasn’t the real world. Because he possessed the Sword Domain, so he could clearly sense that it was an ethereal world created by the middle aged man. The most terrifying part was that the might within the ethereal world couldn’t affect the real world. Besides that, Yang Ye noticed that the middle aged man seemed a little far beyond reach while within the ethereal world!

Elder Li’s eyes were opened wide at the same time, “Changing the world… You’re actually at such a level….”

After that, a battle that shook the world rumbled through the ethereal world.

Yang Ye didn’t leave the ethereal world, and the middle aged man didn’t make him leave either. As far as he was concerned, he didn’t want to miss the chance to watch a battle between Sages from such a close distance. Sages could be considered as the top experts of this world, so a battle between them could definitely teach him a lot.

However, Yang Ye didn’t get to watch for long because it ended in an hour.

The surroundings returned to normal. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

The middle aged man was still there, and so was the old man. However, Yang Ye couldn’t sense any signs of life from the old man.

The middle aged glanced at Elder Li, “Are the Sages so weak now?”

As soon as he finished speaking, Elder Li’s figure gradually turned ethereal, and it didn’t take long for him to vanish completely.

Another Sage had fallen!

In just an hour, two Sages had lost their lives!

Not long after Elder Li perished, the sky trembled, and then a white haired old man suddenly walked out from that expanse of space. He gazed at the middle aged man and said, “Do you have enmity with my Immortal Treasure Pavilion?”

The middle aged man replied with a question, “Who put up Elysium for auction?”

The old man fell silent for a short while, and then he said, “I can’t tell you!”

“Kill him too!” Suddenly, a voice resounded in the sky.

The middle aged man nodded slightly. He didn’t say another word and just vanished on the spot.

At the instant the middle aged man vanished, the white haired old man vanished too.

Yang Ye entered the ethereal world again. But this time, the middle aged man expelled him from it. In the beginning, Yang Ye didn’t understand why, but it didn’t take long for him to understand. It was because the middle aged man had finally met his match.

However, Yang Ye didn’t give up and was about to enter again. Suddenly, a ray of starlight formed a screen that enveloped him, and then the scene before him changed.

A dark world.

Two Sages were in battle, and its intensity far surpassed Yang Ye’s imagination. The ethereal world was collapsing and being obliterated, inch by inch.

It was a true battle between Sages!

Yang Ye’s face was extremely solemn, and he knew that he had no chance of winning against them.

The scene before him proved that there was a difference in strength even between Sages, and the gap between them was huge. Just like Elder Li from before, his strength was far inferior when compared to the middle aged man or the white haired old man.

Just like that, Yang Ye watched for almost an hour, and then the starlight around him suddenly dimmed down. At the same time, countless rays of starlight suddenly appeared in the gray world. As soon as they appeared, the white haired old man’s expression instantly changed, “You’re… from the god race…”

The scene before Yang Ye froze abruptly.

Around ten breaths of time later, the middle aged man and old man appeared before Yang Ye.

Both of them seemed fine on the outside.

Suddenly, the old man said, “It was the Sovereign of Sky who entrusted it to us.” He looked up at the sky and said, “Please spare my Immortal Treasure Pavilion!”

As soon as he finished speaking, his figure gradually turned ethereal, and it didn’t take long for him to vanish completely.

Another Sage had perished!

Yang Ye noticed that many experts and hidden divine senses were sweeping here incessantly, but no one dared to show themselves.

In less than two hours, three Sages had fallen!

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings. He was about to leave when he found that he couldn’t move at all, and then he vanished on the spot an instant later. He’d been forcefully moved somewhere else.

Three breaths of time later, Yang Ye’s figure stopped moving, and there was a middle aged man in front of him. A woman in a white dress stood not too far away from the middle aged man. She had her back towards him, so he couldn’t see her face.

Meanwhile, she suddenly said, “How rare!”

Yang Ye gazed at her with a puzzled look in his eyes, “Huh?”

She shook her head slightly and waved her hand. The middle aged man walked over to Yang Ye, and then he raised a long box in front of Yang Ye.

There was a silver spear in the box.

It was Elysium.

Yang Ye gazed at the middle aged man with a puzzled expression on his face, “What?”

The middle aged man said, “It’s for you!”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Why?”

The middle aged man shook his head, “I want to know the answer to that too. Why is this being given to an extremely ugly and weak fellow?”

Yang Ye felt speechless.
