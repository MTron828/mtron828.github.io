Chapter 2774 – Shall We Fight?

Dreadful!

That battle had been truly quite dreadful. If it hadn’t been for the armor and Heavenshield, Yang Ye would have never been able to endure the force of the explosion.

Cang Mo’s cultivation was already much greater than his, so the power from such a self-detonation was truly too terrifying!

Even with the armor and Heavenshield, he’d been severely injured!

Fortunately, he’d survived!

And survival meant the ability to recover!

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts, and then a short while passed before he walked off to the side. An Nanjing was being completely suppressed by the 12 Demon Guard, and she was practically in a hopeless situation!

All 12 of them were clearly not ordinary Destiny Realm experts. Fighting 12 of them at once was the best An Nanjing could do!

Even Yang Ye may not be able to do the same!

Suddenly, a flying sword shot out of the Sword Gourd on Yang Ye’s waist.

Burial!

One of the 12’s expression changed drastically, and he swiftly waved his pike.

Hiss!

The pike was instantly sliced apart, and the sword continued forward.

He reacted swiftly to this, and he forcefully dodged to the side, but an arm of his still flew up into the air.

Meanwhile, as soon as his figure stopped, a ray of sword energy flashed past his throat.

That Demon Guard’s eyes opened wide, and his figure stiffened.

He’d dodged the first flying sword, and he’d sensed the aura of death coming from this attack. However, the one who wielded the sword was much faster than him.

Once one of them was killed, the others shot backward and gazed fearfully at Yang Ye.

A black sword flew back into the Sword Gourd by Yang Ye’s waist!

Those guards’ expressions instantly became extremely solemn from the sight of this!

What a powerful sword!

Yang Ye walked slowly to An Nanjing’s side, and they just gazed at the guards while the guards had no intent to retreat.

Yang Ye suddenly walked in their direction. An Nanjing glanced at Yang Ye and followed him.

The 11 Demon Guards frowned when they saw Yang Ye walking over!

Is that fellow injured or not?

As far as they were concerned, it was impossible for Yang Ye to have been unscathed by the explosion from before. But if he was injured, why was he being so ferocious right now…?

Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly stopped, glanced at them, and said, “Come at us!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he grabbed the Sword Precursor in his right grasp while a sword howl resounded from the Sword Gourd on his waist.

One of the Demon Guard suddenly stepped forward and said, “He’s trying to scare us away! Kill him!”

All 11 of them immediately charged at Yang Ye and An Nanjing!

At this moment, Yang Ye and An Nanjing sensed 11 formidable auras.

Yang Ye closed his eyes slowly. He’d planned to scare them away. Obviously, they had seen through his intentions. Since he failed to scare them away, he planned to kill until they retreated!

Yang Ye opened his eyes, and then he vanished on the spot.

Meanwhile, An Nanjing suddenly vanished as well.

Bang! Bang!

The two of them instantly entered into battle with the 11 Demon Guards!

Even if he had Burial, Yang Ye found them difficult to kill in an instant. Because all of them were vigilant for it. Moreover, they focused most of their attention on him. So, as long as his flying sword left the Sword Gourd, around five or six of them would join forces against it and forcibly suppress Burial!

If he were in his prime, then fighting them with An Nanjing’s help wouldn’t be a problem at all. The problem was that he wasn’t in his prime! He only had less than 60% of his full strength right now!

Fortunately, An Nanjing was formidable, and that was why they could fight these 11 experts!

Suddenly, an explosion resounded and a figure was blasted backward repeatedly!

It was Yang Ye!

Yang Ye was pushed over 10km back, and a wisp of blood seeped out the corner of his mouth once he stopped himself.

Meanwhile, An Nanjing was instantly besieged!

Bang! Bang! Bang!

An Nanjing was pushed back repeatedly!

Obviously, they’d focused their attacks on Yang Ye to deal with her first!

Yang Ye closed his eyes slowly.

Boom!

A moment later, a terrifying aura appeared!

The 11 Demon Guard looked toward Yang Ye, and they saw him completely blood red.

At this moment, the sword intent he was emanating was a few levels greater than before!

The Demonic Sword Dao!

At the instant he chose to use the Demonic Sword Dao, his sword intent and slaughter intent rose by a few levels. This Sword Dao was an extreme type of the Sword Dao. At the very least, based on its current strength, it was much stronger than his usual Sword Dao!

When they noticed the change in Yang Ye, the 11 Demon Guards seemed like they were facing a formidable opponent!

Suddenly, a ray of blood red sword energy flashed.

One of the 11’s expression changed drastically, and he stabbed his pike forward. He’d put practically all his strength into this attack!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye’s sword arrived.

Hiss!

As soon as the sword and pike came into contact, the pike was sliced open by Yang Ye’s sword. The Demon Guard behind the pike was horrified and hurriedly shot backward. At the same time, a black sword suddenly shot out from the Sword Gourd on Yang Ye’s waist.

Hiss!

The Demon Guard was instantly sliced into two!

Blood sprayed!

The others, who were about to attack, immediately retreated upon witnessing this!

They weren’t cowards, but they still felt quite fearful as they gazed at him right now. He really didn’t seem normal at all.

Yang Ye walked over to An Nanjing and glanced at her. His face was still icy cold, but there was concern in his eyes, “Are you alright?”

An Nanjing shook her head.

Yang Ye gazed at the 10 remaining Demon Guards, “Only 10 of you are left!”

10!

They stared at Yang Ye. They’d lost two of their members until now, and both had been instantly killed by a single attack from Yang Ye!

Instant kills!

Suddenly, Yang Ye vanished on the spot, and a ray of blood red sword energy flashed.

Their expressions changed drastically, and one of them shot backward. The rest shot backward as well. None of them dared to go head-on against this attack!

Yang Ye stopped because they had gone over 10km away!

He looked up at them, “Are you going to fight or not?”

They stared at Yang Ye, and one of them stepped forward with the intent to attack. However, they seemed to have received some sort of order at this moment and retreated. A moment later, all of them vanished from Yang Ye and An Nanjing’s fields of vision.

They’d left!

Yang Ye returned to normal, but his entire body suddenly cracked open and blood seeped out from him.

An Nanjing walked over to Yang Ye. She gazed at him and asked, “Is it very serious?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “Not really!”

The repeated battles and especially entering the Demonic Sword Dao to forcefully annihilate one of them had caused an excessive burden on his body. In the end, it was because Cang Mo’s self-detonation had injured him too severely.

An Nanjing suddenly said, “You head inside and rest. I’ll stand on guard!”

Yang Ye gazed at her and spoke softly, “No matter what I’ve done throughout these years, you’ve always stayed by my side and helped me… I’m sorry for putting you through all of this.”

An Nanjing shook her head, “You don’t have to say anything like that!”

Yang Ye smiled, “Right!”

Yang Ye returned to the Primordial Pagoda while An Nanjing just stood outside with Dagger-Axe in her grasp.

In the Primordial Pagoda.

Yang Ye went to the cultivation room. His goal was to recover quickly.

Of course, with the help of Snowy and Primordial Violet Energy, so long as he wasn’t dead, recovery was just a matter of time.

Meanwhile, the battle at a distant part of the starry sky was still going on!

Qi Bitian was fighting the shadow. While it was just a shadow, it was extremely formidable!

Even Qi Bitian could only fight it equally!

But Tu and the others were completely suppressing the demon beasts!

Suppression!

Utter Suppression!

Bang!

Suddenly, Qi Bitian shot backward repeatedly, and she was pushed extremely far away!

Tu and the others looked up.

The demon beasts immediately retreated and created space between them and Tu’s group.

The shadow retreated to the demon beasts as well.

The shadow gazed at Qi Bitian and the others for a long time, and then it led the demon beasts away.

Tian Xiu was about to attack, but Qi Bitian stopped her, “We can’t kill them!”

Just like that, the shadow and the demon beasts retreated. A short while later, they had vanished from Qi Bitian and the others’ vision.

The surroundings fell silent.

Meanwhile, Tu took a large gulp of wine and said, “Time to go!”

She turned around and walked off.

Yang Busi suddenly obstructed her path, and the latter cracked a smile, “If you haven’t had enough, that’s fine. We can continue!”

Tu charged at her.

Yang Busi naturally refused to display weakness and charged at Tu too.

Qi Bitian and Tian Xiu glanced at them, and then they shook their heads and left.

Their objective was the distant Four Dimensional Universe.

The two shot through space.

Qi Bitian suddenly said, “That fellow was very strong!”

Tian Xiu nodded, “Those demons were very strong too! The Three Dimensional Universe is no match for them!”

Qi Bitian spoke softly, “I’m afraid we may never return after this. So, why don’t we meet that fellow before we go?”

Tian Xiu shook her head, “It isn’t necessary?”

Qi Bitian smiled, “Why?”

Tian Xiu replied softly, “I don’t like being sentimental!”

Qi Bitian roared with laughter.

A short while later, they gradually vanished into the distance.

Their objective was the Four Dimensional Universe.
