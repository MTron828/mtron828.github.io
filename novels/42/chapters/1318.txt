Chapter 1319 – I’ll Be Your Zi’er In My Next Life Too!

“Once I’m done with all of you, I’ll go deal with that fellow, Yang Ye!” As soon as the old man finished speaking, he twisted his right hand slightly and space instantly warped. Qian Lankong and the others were horrified because they noticed that they couldn’t move at all. It wasn’t that they actually couldn’t move, it was that their speed seemed to have grown 100 times slower. Even taking a single breath took a few breaths of time!

They could only wait for death to arrive!

That was what all of them thought.

Suddenly, the old man frowned and looked down. At this moment, someone was walking towards where Zi’er’s figure had fallen.

It was Yang Ye.

Qian Lankong and the others instantly heaved sighs of relief when they saw him.

Yang Ye arrived at the deep hole in the ground, and his face was completely emotionless as he gazed at Zi’er who laid within it. However, his hands were trembling incessantly. At this moment, Zi’er’s right cheek was completely swollen, and there was a bloody palm print there. Besides that, the bones and meridians throughout Zi’er’s body were shattered!

That wasn’t the most severe problem. The most severe problem was that her aura was extremely weak right now, and it seemed like she would die at any moment.

The old man had comprehended the Laws of Time. According to Mo Xiaoleng, he was a true Voider. Zi’er’s strength laid in her spatial techniques, but her physical body was her weakness. So, how could she possibly endure the attack of a true Voider?

Yang Ye squatted down by ZI’er’s side and stretched out his hand to carry her up. However, his hand had just touched her when her figure shuddered, and then pain appeared on her face. Her bones were completely shattered. Coupled with the fact that her meridians were broken, not to mention moving her, even allowing a breeze to hit her would cause excruciating pain.

After all, she wasn’t Yang Ye. Yang Ye was practically immune to pain, but she wasn’t. Her entire body was extremely weak!

Yang Ye stared blankly at her while she was in pain, and then tears couldn’t help but flow from his eyes. He placed his hands above Zi’er without touching her body, and then his violet energy surged madly into her. As soon as it entered her body, her aura immediately stabilized slightly.

Meanwhile, Nie Tian and the others arrived here.

Nie Tian bowed slightly to the old man and spoke respectfully, “Second Uncle!”

The old man nodded slightly, and then he looked at Yang Ye, “Yang Ye, my Nie Clan is benevolent and will give you a chance to live. So long as you give us a strand of your soul, my Nie Clan is willing to spare you, your woman, and your subordinates. Otherwise, today is the day that all of you die.”

Actually, it really was quite a pity to kill a genius like Yang Ye. If he could make Yang Ye work for the Nie Clan, then not to mention Dark Hell Continent, the Nie Clan would even be able to gain a place for itself in the world outside.

After all, Yang Ye was a monstrous genius comparable to Jian Wuji!

Nie Tian spoke in a low voice, “Second Uncle, he won’t surrender.”

The old man replied, “I know, but I still want to try.” As he spoke, he gazed at Yang Ye and continued, “Yang Ye, if you refuse, then it isn’t just the people here who’ll die, even your Sword Alliance will be annihilated. But if you surrender, my Nie Clan won’t illtreat you. Moreover, besides 2 people, you won’t have to listen to the orders of anyone else in the Nie Clan.”

Everyone looked at Yang Ye and awaited his answer.

Meanwhile, the violet mink had recovered under the recuperative effects of Yang Ye’s violet energy. Moreover, her internal organs and some meridians had recovered quite a bit. Besides that, she’d regained consciousness.

Yang Ye touched her swollen face gently and said, “I’m sorry! I was too late!”

She held his hand and spoke gently, “I’m not afraid of death, but I’m afraid of being unable to see you again. So, you must live, you must survive.”

Yang Ye shook his head and said, “I can’t guarantee that this time. But I can guarantee that I’ll definitely kill the person who hit you, I definitely will! No matter the cost!”

As he spoke, he pointed at his chest and said, “Get in there. If I die, we’ll die together!”

She gazed at him for a long time before tears started to well up in her eyes, “I’d thought that I’d become stronger and could help you. However, I still have no choice but to watch as you fight. Aren’t I really useless?”

Yang Ye touched her face gently and revealed a slight smile, “Let’s talk about that later. Be good and go in there. I’m going to suffer from backlash soon.”

Zi’er stretched out her hand to help him wipe off the tears on his face, “If there’s a cycle of reincarnation, then I’ll still be your Zi’er in my next life.” As soon as she finished speaking, she transformed into a ray of violet light that entered Yang Ye’s chest.

Yang Ye took a deep breath, and then he looked up at Nie Tian’s group. Meanwhile, the old man who led the group said, “Yang Ye, my offer is still open. You just have to surrender to my Nie Clan, and I, Nie Hun, guarantee that your status in the Nie Clan will only be inferior to 2 people. Moreover, the Nie Clan will help you advance into the Emperor Realm and Voider Realm! But if you refuse to act sensibly, then the Nie Clan will annihilate the Slayer Pavilion and Sword Alliance!”

Yang Ye closed his eyes and remained silent for a few breaths of time, and then he suddenly opened his eyes and looked at Qian Lankong’s group, “Leave!”

Qian Lankong and the others bowed slightly to Yang Ye, and then they shot towards the distance.

Nie Hun spoke indifferently, “They won’t be able to escape!”

“Is that so?” Yang Ye gazed at Nie Hun. A moment later, his eyes turned red. Moreover, his entire body started to turn red. In the blink of an eye, a pungent smell of blood and baleful energy appeared here. Moreover, Yang Ye’s eyes were like oceans of blood.

Nie Hun’s eyes narrowed slightly at the sight of this, and he said, “Kill everyone!” At this moment, even an idiot would understand Yang Ye’s intentions. Just as Nie Tian had said, Yang Ye wouldn’t surrender. Since Yang Ye refused to surrender, then he had to die.

Nie Tian and the others nodded, and then they shot after Qian Lankong’s group. Suddenly, a blood red ray of light shot up into the sky. Everywhere it passed, the entire sky was instantly dyed blood red.

Nie Tian and the others were shocked, and they were about to stop and resist Yang Ye. However, Nie Hun suddenly said, “I’ll do it. All of you deal with those assassins.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he took a step forward while twisting his right hand slightly. In an instant, the blood red ray of light that frozen on the spot.

The Laws of Time!

Nie Tian and the others heaved sighs of relief at the sight of this. They ignored Yang Ye and continued their pursuit. However, a mysterious force suddenly appeared, and then a dazzling glow suddenly erupted from the blood red ray of light that Nie Hun had frozen on the spot. A moment later, it flashed through the sky. The head of a Voider that was around 3km away had instantly flown into the air!

Nie Tian and the others were horrified. They decisively gave up on pursuing Qian Lankong’s group, and they immediately converged together before looking vigilantly at Yang Ye who was emanating a blood red glow.

“How could that be possible...?” Meanwhile, Nie Hun gazed at Yang Ye with disbelief, “How... how could you have possibly suppressed my Laws....” He seemed to have thought of something at this point, and his eyes instantly opened wide, “That’s... that’s the energy of a Domain! The Sword Domain! You’ve comprehended the Sword Domain!”

As he finished speaking, his voice was actually trembling!

The Sword Domain!

It was a Domain that surpassed all Laws of the world!

Nie Hun was beyond shocked. Obviously, he hadn’t expected Yang Ye to have actually comprehended the Sword Domain at such a young age. After all, Jian Wuji hadn’t comprehended the Sword Domain when he was at Yang Ye’s age!

Yang Ye pressed his blood red sword against his forehead, and the blood red wings behind him flapped lightly. Every single flap caused waves of blood red light to sweep towards the surroundings. Yang Ye didn’t waste his breath, nor was it necessary. A moment later, the blood red wings on Yang Ye’s back flapped forcefully, and then his figure transformed into a ray of blood red light that vanished on the spot.

Nie Hun was horrified, “Watch out!”

As soon as he finished speaking.

Hiss!

A ray of blood red light pierced through the forehead of a Voider that hadn’t even been able to react. The eyes of that Voider from the Nie Clan opened wide as he died, and then his corpse vanished on the spot.

Nie Hun hurriedly said, “Suppress him!”

As soon as they heard Nie Hun’s order, the auras of the remaining Voiders immediately erupted from within them and pressed down towards Yang Ye.

As soon as their auras appeared, a strand of sword intent suddenly appeared in the surroundings, and then their auras were stopped. After being stuck in a stalemate for a short while, Nie Tian and the others’ expressions changed drastically because their auras were actually being pushed back!

All of them were shocked. They hadn’t expected that the auras of so many Voiders would actually be unable to suppress Yang Ye. Not only were they unable to suppress Yang Ye, it seemed like they would be suppressed instead!

“Hold on! It’ll take a short while at most for him to suffer backlash!” Nie Hun spoke solemnly from afar. He was much stronger than other Voiders because he possessed the Laws of Time. Yet now, the Laws of Time had no effect on Yang Ye. So, even he had no chance of victory against Yang Ye. After all, Yang Ye’s current sword intent had completely surpassed the strength of a Voider.

However, he was very well aware that Yang Ye would definitely suffer from backlash. Regardless of whether one utilized external sources to improve one’s sword intent, cultivation, or something else, there would be a time limit. Just like the situation Yang Ye was in right now. Once its time was up, his sword intent would return to normal. At that time, he would definitely suffer backlash from his sword intent.

So, Yang Ye was equivalent to overusing his strength right now!

It would only last for a short while!

Even though Yang Ye seemed all-powerful right now, it would only last for a short while!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye’s eyes were closed while his brows were knit tightly together. Moreover, traces of pain could be seen on his face. He was very well aware that he couldn’t last for long, and he would suffer backlash very soon!

Flee? Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Flee where?

He had nowhere to flee. Because they wouldn’t let him go. Fleeing would only slightly delay his death. Since he would die anyway, it was better to drag a few down with him!

So, when he thought up to this point, a ruthless expression instantly arose on his face. He suddenly opened his eyes, stretched his hand forward, and made a grasping motion, “Brink!”

As soon as he spoke, Yang Ye’s Quasi Returnal Rank sword intent instantly started to be compressed!
