Chapter 1826 – The Spirit Shaping Tree and Soul Nurturing Flower!

Yang Ye frowned, “The Nether Abyss? A forbidden area here?”

Blood Maiden nodded, “There are numerous dangerous places throughout Heaven Pillar Mountain. But only three are considered the most dangerous. One of them is the Nether Abyss. According to rumor, a senior cultivator entered it once, and he never came back!”

Yang Ye asked, “That place was created by your Nether Pavilion’s previous master?”

Blood Maiden nodded slightly, “Pavilion Master Siyou lived there all those years ago.”

Yang Ye spoke softly, “She’s that strong….”

Shao Siyou!

Yang Ye had heard that name on more than one occasion, and he knew that she was extremely strong. However, he hadn’t expected her to be that strong. Because where she once resided had become a forbidden area in Heaven Pillar Mountain.

After all, every single expert here was a very old and established expert.

Since even they thought of it as a forbidden area, it was obvious how terrifying Shao Siyou was!

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts and said, “Let’s go there now!”

Meanwhile, Yang Lianshuang suddenly said, “I’ll stay here!”

All of them gazed at her.

Yang Lianshuang grinned, “I just feel that we must establish a base of operations here. Moreover, we have to gain a full understanding of Heaven Pillar Mountain. After all, the distribution of forces here is complicated. We must know our enemies. Don’t you think so too?”

Blood Maiden thought for a moment and nodded, “You’re right. Even though we know a little about this place, our knowledge is limited.” She gazed at Yang Lianshuang and continued, “But it’s very dangerous. Will you….”

Yang Lianshuang smiled, “It’s fine, they want to kill Yang Ye, and not me. Moreover, I won’t establish it out in the open.”

Blood Maiden seemed to want to say something when Yang Ye suddenly spoke, “Second Sister, trust her!”

He fully trusted Yang Lianshuang. Because she wasn’t just strong, she was absolutely intelligent as well.

Intelligence!

Yang Ye suddenly thought of someone when he thought up to this point, and he gazed at Blood Maiden, “Second Sister, did Ding Shaoyao come with all of you?”

Ding Shaoyao!

That woman who’d almost died for him in the past! He naturally hadn’t forgotten her!

Blood Maiden replied, “She came with us. However, she left on her own upon arriving here.”

Yang Ye frowned, “She left on her own?”

Blood Maiden nodded, “I don’t know what she’s planning, but she’s a very independent woman, and an extremely intelligent one. So, she should be fine. After all, no one knows about her link to you!”

Yang Ye nodded and didn’t speak further.

Meanwhile, Blood Maiden suddenly gazed at Resentment Maiden, Boundary Maiden, Light Maiden, Shadow Maiden, Ice Maiden, and Oblivion Maiden, “All six of you stay and help her!”

They nodded slightly.

Blood Maiden gazed at Yang Ye, “Let’s go!”

Yang Ye nodded, and then he vanished on the spot with Blood Maiden, Nether Maiden, and the pig-riding young woman.

Oblivion Maiden suddenly gazed at Yang Lianshuang, “What should we do?”

Yang Lianshuang grinned, “We have a lot to do.” She gazed at Oblivion Maiden and the others, “I want to create a temporary organization, and we’ll call it the Queen Army. Alright?”

All of them felt speechless.

Yang Ye shot through the boundless mountain range like a shadow while Snowy stood on his shoulder. As for Blood Maiden and the others, they’d entered the Primordial Pagoda. They’d gone to the cultivation room there.

Since they found out about that heaven defying cultivation room which Yang Ye possessed, they’d stayed there without any intention of leaving!

All along the way, Yang Ye sensed numerous hidden and formidable auras. Fortunately, nothing happened because he’d used the Sword Domain to conceal both himself and Snowy. So, unless someone passed by right in front of him, no one would be able to notice his presence.

Besides that, he didn’t want any trouble because his objective was the Nether Abyss!

Around six hours later, Snowy suddenly wrapped her claws around Yang Ye’s neck and pulled it backwards with all her might.

Stop!

She was asking Yang Ye to stop!

Yang Ye stopped and gazed at her. Meanwhile, Snowy raised her claw and pointed towards the right while excitement filled her eyes.

A treasure!

There was a treasure over there!

Yang Ye knew her well, so he knew that Snowy had found some sort of treasure.

Yang Ye thought for a moment and said, “We have to go somewhere else!”

Snowy blinked, and then she pointed in that direction while excitement and happiness filled her eyes.

It was a very precious treasure!

Snowy was telling him that the treasure over there was extremely precious!

Yang Ye was about to speak when Snowy suddenly went into the Primordial Pagoda. It didn’t take her long to emerge once more, and she had a Lifespan Fruit in her grasp. She pointed towards the right, pointed at the Lifespan Fruit, and then looked at it like it was worthless.

Yang Ye felt speechless.

The treasure over there was many times better than the Lifespan Fruits!

That was what Snowy meant!

“Er…” Yang Ye was hesitant. He hesitated because he was very well aware that a place with a precious treasure was usually dangerous. Especially in Heaven Pillar Mountain. The danger there would definitely be extraordinary!

Meanwhile, Snowy raised her claw, and a Violet Crystal appeared there. She passed it over to Yang Ye while pointing towards the right with her other claw. Obviously, she was telling him that she would give it to him if he went that way! Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Yang Ye didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. He rubbed her head gently and said, “Alright, we’ll go have a look. But we’ll leave if there’s danger. Alright?”

Actually, he was very curious as well. Because it actually made Snowy so excited and happy!

After all, Snowy was very picky. At the very least, Lifespan Fruits were nothing to her!

Snowy immediately hugged Yang Ye’s face when she heard him, and then she rubbed her head against his forehead. After that, she took Yang Ye’s hand and pulled him towards the right.

Yang Ye placed Snowy on his shoulder while a sword appeared in his grasp. This place was extremely dangerous, so he had to be careful. As for the treasure, he was just curious about it and wasn’t determined to get it. Of course, it would be great if he could.

It didn’t take long for Snowy to lead him to a gorge.

The gorge was surrounded by three mountains, and their locations were like the tips of a triangle that surrounded the gorge. The center of the area was like a basin that sunk down, and the surroundings were perfectly silent.

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings. He sensed no auras here, and it was extremely quiet!

He knew something was off!

Meanwhile, Snowy pointed towards the depths of the area.

Yang Ye looked over. The depths of the gorge was completely pitch black. Even sunlight couldn’t penetrate it. As for him, he couldn’t see anything in it either.

Something was really off!

At this moment, Yang Ye had the intent to leave. He was very well aware that the greater a treasure was, the danger around it would usually be greater too.

Suddenly, Yang Ye turned to look at the entrance to the gorge. A gray robed man had suddenly appeared there.

A 6th stage True Realm expert!

The gray robed man glanced at the surroundings. In the end, he looked towards the depths of the gorge. He hesitated for a moment, and then he went towards its depths.

The gray robed man was clearly very vigilant. Profound energy fluctuated around him, and he was ready to attack at any moment.

Just like that, Yang Ye watched the gray robed man enter the darkness.

A few breaths of time later, roaring laughter resounded from there, “A Spirit Shaping Tree, a Soul Nurturing Flower, a Fruit of Rebirth… Hahaha! I didn’t expect such divine treasures to be here! Hahaha….”

His voice was filled with joy, excitement, and a trace of madness.

Yang Ye frowned. Spirit Shaping Tree? Soul Nurturing Flower? Fruit of Rebirth? What the heck is that?

Meanwhile, Qiong Qi’s voice resounded in Yang Ye’s mind, “Kid, those are treasures, very good treasures. Get them if you can!”

After that, Hou Qing’s voice resounded in his mind as well, “They’re great treasures indeed!”

Yang Ye was about to speak when a shrill cry suddenly resounded from within the gorge, but it stopped abruptly just a moment later.

The man’s voice appeared abruptly and vanished swiftly!

The gorge was silent once more!

Snowy blinked, and then she couldn’t help but grab Yang Ye’s shoulder with both her claws.

Suddenly, a huge amount of red liquid flowed out from the darkness!

Blood!

It was blood!

Yang Ye looked in that direction for a long time, and then he immersed his mind into his body. He asked, “Both of you said they are great treasures. What are those things?”

Qiong Qi explained, “The Spirit Shaping Tree can be planted within your mind. Once it fully merges with your spirit, your spiritual energy will surpass Enlightened Realm experts. Attaining that is absolutely beneficial. The Soul Nurturing Flower nurtures the soul. It’s countless times superior to the Ku Clan’s Soul Nurturing Tree. If you obtain that flower and fuse it into your soul, then your soul will become absolutely terrifying. At that time, even a soul attack from an Enlightened Realm expert or Hou Qing’s Soul Extraction wouldn’t be able to harm you at all!”

He paused for a moment and continued, “The most important is the Fruit of Rebirth. It can really achieve rebirth. Not only can it transform your body, it can save your life at the critical moment. Let me explain like this. Even if someone shatters your meridians and internal organs, it can still allow you to achieve rebirth. If you consume it right now, your Undying Hegemon technique will instantly rise to the 2nd level, Blood Rebirth!”

Blood Rebirth!

Yang Ye took a deep breath. Simply speaking, so long as he obtained the treasures in there, his overall strength would undergo a qualitative transformation!

Suddenly, Yang Ye started moving towards the darkness.

Yang Ye’s face instantly turned grim!

Because he wasn’t moving! But he was moving!

Bang!

Two types of intents swept out from him, but it only took a moment for his intents to be pressed back into his body!

Yang Ye was shocked. He quickly contacted Qiong Qi and Hou Qing, but they didn’t answer him at all!

Yang Ye was horrified. He hurriedly circulated his profound energy, but it only took a moment for his profound energy to fall deathly silent.

Thus, he moved his attention to the Primordial Pagoda and tried to use it, but it didn’t react at all!

Yang Ye’s expression changed again.

Everything was done in vain!

Just like that, Yang Ye could only watch as his body walked slowly towards the darkness…
