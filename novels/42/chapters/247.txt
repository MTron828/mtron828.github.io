Chapter 248 – Advancement!

After he left the square outside the Imperial Palace, Yang Ye arrived at the Immortal Indulgence Pavilion. However, to Yang Ye’s surprise, it was actually closed! After he asked someone the shops around it, Yang Ye found out that it had suddenly closed at the same time he’d entered the Ascension Mountain Range, and then all its workers seemed to have vanished into thin air!

As he gazed at the tightly closed door of the pavilion, Yang Ye fell silent. The only method of communication between Qin Xiyue and him was through the Immortal Indulgence Pavilion. Now that it was closed, how would he get in contact with her? Of course, there was even some worry in the depths of his heart, and he was worried about why the Immortal Indulgence Pavilion had suddenly closed!

Did she intend to cut off all contact with me, or did she encounter other difficulties that forced her to close it and cut off all contact with me?Even though there was something ambiguous between the two of them, he knew that it was mostly a relationship of mutual benefit. Qin Xiyue might have a good impression of him, but Yang Ye really didn’t believe that she’d fallen for him. A woman like Qin Xiyue who’d grown up in the Imperial Palace would absolutely not fall for a person so easily!

After a short while, Yang Ye shook his head, and then he turned around and left. In his opinion, his main objective right now was the Ascension Rankings. As for Qin Xiyue, he could only put it aside for now. Because if he died during the competition, then all of this would be meaningless. So, the thing he had to achieve above all was obtaining the first in the Ascension Rankings and surviving it!

After he left the Immortal Indulgence Pavilion, Yang Ye walked slowly and aimlessly on the streets. Because he noticed to his sorrow that he didn’t even have a place to stay!

A wisp of self-ridicule suffused the corners of Yang Ye’s mouth, and then he continued walking slowly and aimlessly ahead.

Right at this moment, Yang Ye suddenly stopped moving, and then he looked ahead because Su Qingshi who wore white clothes had suddenly appeared there. A wisp of a smile appeared on his face when he saw her because no matter what, she hadn’t forgotten him in the end, and this was enough for him!

Su Qingshi gazed at Yang Ye while a wisp of a complicated expression flashed in her eyes. She’d asked herself if she liked this man who stood before her. Yes or no? She’d asked the same question to herself on countless occasions, but she didn’t have an answer to this question since the beginning. Or perhaps, she’d never been willing to face the truest thoughts that were in the depths of her heart!

She shook her head slightly, and then she said, “Why didn’t you return to the Sword Sect?”

Yang Ye smiled and said, “You’re aware of the relationship between the Sword Sect and me. My return would only put those members of the Sword Sect and me in an awkward position. So, it’s best not to return there.”

Su Qingshi fell silent, and then she said after a short while, “You’re in a very dangerous situation right now. If it’s possible, then give up on the 1st on the Ascension Rankings tomorrow, alright?”

Yang Ye shook his head and said, “I’m aware that no matter if it’s the Origin School, Flower Palace, the Imperial Academy’s Qin Youran, or even the Sword Sect’s Lin Xiuran, all of them want to kill me. But it can’t be helped, I’m determined to obtain the 1st on the Ascension Rankings, even if I have to give up my life for it!”

Su Qingshi shook her head lightly and said, “If you obtain the 1st, then the Origin School and Flower Palace would definitely not allow you to live!”

Yang Ye nodded and said, “I know, but I still intend to strive to obtain the 1st. Because if I’m unable to accomplish that, then I would really have no chance of survival. On the other hand, if I obtained the 1st, then I, Yang Ye, would be of value again. At that time, the Grand Qin Empire, the Talisman Master’s Association, and even the Sword Sect would see me in a new light, wouldn’t they?”

Actually, Yang Ye had always understood that he was currently cornered. The Origin School and Flower Palace wanted to kill him, and it was no secret. If it wasn’t because the Ascension Rankings were being carried out right now, then he who wasn’t a member of the Talisman Master’s Association anymore would have probably died a long time ago. If he wanted to overcome the situation, then just as he said, he had to make those powers see him in a new light and gain a new understanding of the value he represented!

So long as he obtained the 1st on the Ascension Rankings, then he believed that the Sword Sect, the Grand Qin Empire, and even the Talisman Master’s Association would stand out to protect him. Reality was just that cruel. Those without value could only resign themselves to a fate of being abandoned, but those with value would receive the concern and protection of countless others.

Su Qingshi fell silent again. She admitted that Yang Ye’s words really made sense. Presently, Yang Ye really was cornered, and if he couldn’t prove his value, then Daoist Zui wouldn’t stand out to protect him, the Talisman Master’s Association wouldn’t stand out to protect him, and even the Grand Qin Empire would naturally not become enemies with the Origin School and Flower Palace for the sake of a person with no value!

Just as Yang Ye had said, Yang Ye could only obtain a chance at survival by fighting desperately with his life on the line!

Su Qingshi sighed lightly, and then she said, “I don’t know what trump cards you possess that allows you to have the confidence to seize the 1st. I only want to say that not to mention Yuan Tong, just Qin Youran, Wenren Yue, Leng Xinran, and Lin Xiuran who Martial Uncle Daoist Zui found for the Sword Sect possess extraordinary strength. It’s truly very difficult for you to seize the 1st!”

When he sensed the worry in Su Qingshi’s tone, Yang Ye’s heart felt warm, and then he said with a smile on his face, “Don’t worry, since I dare to aim my sword at the 1st, then I have some confidence. You know me well, I’m not someone that acts beyond his ability. I wouldn’t go give my life away if I couldn’t accomplish it.”

Su Qingshi glanced at Yang Ye, and then she hesitated for a moment before she said, “Lin Xiuran is a genius that Martial Uncle Zui found for the Sword Sect. Since his teaching comes from Martial Uncle Zui, his attainments in the Sword Dao are extremely deep. You have to be careful if you encounter him in battle. Besides that, I hope you can spare his life if he loses to you, alright?”

Yang Ye chuckled and said, “Qingshi, you witnessed it as well just now. It’s he who’s hostile towards me. I’m sure that if we encounter each other in the competition, then he’ll definitely strike to kill. Since it’s like that, then it’s naturally impossible for me to hold back. So, I can’t agree to this request of yours. Because since he wants to kill me, then I’ll kill him!”

He could make a compromise on many things, but he wouldn’t change his principles. Lin Xiuran’s killing intent towards him was extremely obvious, so he would naturally not be such an idiot to actually show mercy during the competition.

Su Qingshi sighed lightly when she heard Yang Ye. No matter if it was Yang Ye or Lin Xiuran, she didn’t hope that any one of them died in the arena. Lin Xiuran was someone that Daoist Zui had chosen. So, if Yang Ye killed him, then it was very likely for Yang Ye to leave a bad impression in Daoist Zui’s heart. This was definitely not good for Yang Ye.

Moreover, the Sword Sect really needed capable geniuses like Lin Xiuran now!

Su Qingshi didn’t speak further. She glanced at Yang Ye, hesitated for a moment, and then her figure flashed. She instantly appeared in front of Yang Ye, and then Yang Ye felt a wave of faint fragrance assault his face before a warm and delicate figure pressed onto his own body. He heard Su Qingshi speak in a low voice. “Survive until the competition ends!”

As soon as she finished speaking, her figure flashed and vanished in front of Yang Ye.

After a short while, Yang Ye returned to his senses, and then he smiled happily. Even though he knew that Su Qingshi had said those words because she didn’t want the Sword Sect to lose a genius, as a man, Yang Ye had still felt slightly uncomfortable when Su Qingshi asked him to spare Lin Xiuran’s life. Because the Sword Sect’s status was always higher than his within her heart.

Of course, he also felt that Su Qingshi treated him nicely because he was of value to the Sword Sect and could bring benefit to it. However, the last things Su Qingshi had said earlier before she left allowed him to realize that he had a place in her heart after all. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Perhaps it still wasn’t higher than the Sword Sect, but it was already sufficient for him.

Yang Ye was a completely blank slate when it came to emotional experience. He didn’t know how to love someone. He only knew that if he liked someone, then he should work hard for it and give the best to that person, even if that person didn’t love him! Even though one-sided love was arduous, being able to fall for someone was already an extremely joyous thing to him! Of course, if the person he loved was able to fall for him as well, then it would be even more joyous!

As he thought about it, the smile on Yang Ye’s face gradually widened. However, right at this moment, Yang Ye’s eyes suddenly opened wide. Moreover, the Violet Spirit sword in his hand suddenly let out a howl before it started trembling violently. It seemed as if Violet Spirit intended to struggle free from his grasp and shoot into the sky.

The ground where he stood was covered in hard limestone, but countless cracks mysteriously appeared on them like spiderwebs. In the beginning, these cracks had only appeared beneath Yang Ye’s legs, but in less than two breaths of time, the fine cracks that seemed like spiderwebs had extended out in all directions.

At this moment, with Yang Ye at the center, the limestone that paved the ground in an area of 30m around him had cracked inch by inch.

Fortunately, it was at night, and this street was in a remote area of the city, so no one noticed this mysterious scene!

After standing on the spot for a short while, Yang Ye shook his head and laughed bitterly as he said, “I never expected that just allowing my thoughts to clear up allowed my Sword Intent to attain the 4th level.... How dramatic!”

Yes, Yang Ye had attained the 4th level of Sword Intent at this moment. As for why he’d directly attained the 4th level of Sword Intent now, even Yang Ye himself wasn’t very sure. However, he faintly felt that it might be because he’d overcome the conflicted feelings in his heart just now and allowed his thoughts to become clear. However, no matter what, being able to improve his Sword Intent to the 4th level was undoubtedly good news for Yang Ye now. Because it allowed him to have even more confidence and strength when he faced those young geniuses in battle tomorrow!

Yang Ye took a few glances at the scene in the surroundings caused by the Sword Intent that leaked from him, and then he roared with laughter before his figure flashed and vanished on the spot!
