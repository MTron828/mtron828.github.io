Chapter 2012 – Brothers!

That’s such a familiar voice!Yang Ye looked up, and a man appeared there. It only took a moment for the man to descend in front of Yang Ye.

Both of them were stunned when they saw each other.

“It’s you!” The man exclaimed, and then he ran over to Yang Ye and punched Yang Ye lightly on the chest. He smiled, “You didn’t even tell me you were coming!”

Yang Ye chuckled, “I didn’t expect it to be you!”

It was none other than Yu Jing.

Countless members of the sky race were stunned by their actions. They know each other?

As for the white robed old man, his face was quite unsightly!

Yang Ye was clearly in a very good mood. He sized up Yu Jing and said, “You’ve grown stronger!”

Yu Jing smiled, “I’m much inferior when compared to you.” He paused for a moment and added, “Why are you causing trouble in the Sky Dimension? Tell me why. My clan has a bit of power in the Sky Dimension, and we can help.”

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and explained, “The Sovereign of Sky has a friend of mine, and he refuses to release my friend!”

Yu Jing frowned. He fell silent for a moment, and then he gazed at the white robed old man, “Elder Zhu, do you know who he is?”

The white robed old man spoke in a low voice, “What, you intend to admit defeat before you even fight? Aren’t you afraid that your Yu Clan will become the laughingstock of the sky race?”

“The laughingstock of the sky race?” Yu Jing chuckled, “Elder Zhu, not to mention my Yu Clan, even you would probably be unable to do anything to him!” Besides me, no one else in the sky race has a better understanding of how terrifying Yang Ye is.

The white robed old man frowned. Meanwhile, Yu Jing looked at the crowd down below, “I used to be just like all of you. I was confident, and I felt that I was superior because I belonged to the sky race. However, after going to the Dead Dimension, I realized that the world is huge, and there are many geniuses in it. If our sky race continues to be so arrogant, our future is worrying!”

“Shut up!” Suddenly, the old man roared with fury, “Yu Jing, I thought you would be able to lead our sky race’s younger generation, but now it seems like I thought too much of you. I’m very disappointed in you. If you’re unwilling to fight, my sky race naturally has others to fight him!”

“Coward!” Countless people cursed from below the arena.

“How disappointing! He actually praised the enemy and spoke ill about us? Yu Jing? The number one genius? How truly laughable!”

“Is Yang Ye that terrifying? Yu Jing is such a piece of trash! He doesn’t even dare to fight!”

“Shut your mouths!” Suddenly, Yang Ye roared, and his voice rumbled like a deafening thunderclap.

Everyone gazed at Yang Ye.

Yang Ye glanced at the crowd, and then he pointed at Yu Jing, “He’s trash? If he’s trash, then let me be honest about something, all of you can’t even be called trash. If you refuse to accept that, then come up here and fight me. If you dare not, then shut your mouths. Stop barking over there!”

Countless people were furious when they heard Yang Ye, and they continued their curses.

However, no one dared to challenge Yang Ye.

Yu Jing fell silent for a long time, and then he gazed at Yang Ye. He was just about to speak when Yang Ye suddenly said, “I won’t continue if it’ll affect you negatively.”

Yu Jing shook his head, “Go on!” Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Huh?”

Yu Jing didn’t explain and asked, “What’s your friend’s name? Where is he or her? Maybe I can help you gather some information.”

Yang Ye replied, “Her name is Zi’er. She was with a woman from the sky race called Xiao Qi. Xiao Qi is the Sovereign of Sky’s daughter!”

“Xiao Qi!” Yu Jing nodded slightly, “I understand. You continue here. I’ll go investigate for you!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he vanished from the arena.

Once Yu Jing left, a figure took him to a remote corner. It was a middle aged man who was quite similar in appearance to Yu Jing.

“What the heck are you doing?” The middle aged man spoke in a low voice, “Do you know what kind of effect those words you spoke will have on our clan?”

Yu Jing nodded, “I do!”

The middle aged man spoke angrily, “Then why did you do that?”

Yu Jing turned to glance at the crowd, “Dad, what do you think about them?”

The middle aged man fell silent for a short while, and then he said, “They can talk the talk, but they can’t walk the walk!”

Yu Jing nodded, “There are too many people like them in our sky race. We have an innate sense of superiority, and I had it too. But Dad, do you know what happened? After I went to the Dead Dimension, that sense of superiority almost got me killed.”

The middle aged man spoke in a low voice, “What are you trying to say?”

Yu Jing smiled, “Only the strong are respected in the world outside, and it isn’t a world that respects the sky race. If they go out to the outside world and still hold onto that sense of superiority, they’ll be smashed into bits.”

The middle aged man asked, “That’s why you gave up?”

Yu Jing gazed at Yang Ye, “Of course not. The main reason is that I’m no match for him!”

The middle aged man frowned, “Even with your current strength?”

Yu Jing replied, “He was our leader in the Dead Dimension. He was the one who led us out when we were besieged by a million demon beasts. Besides that, he led us back to Southern Qilin Mountain too, and he was the one who got us a chance to leave the Dead Dimension. You would have had to bury me if it wasn’t for him!”

The middle aged man fell silent.

Meanwhile, Yu Jing added, “Dad, if I’m to be honest, it isn’t just our sky race. There probably aren’t many in the younger generation of all the races that can fight him. Perhaps only the geniuses of those four top clans can fight him. Moreover, according to my knowledge, his background is very mysterious too. He’s absolutely not ordinary!”

The middle aged man glanced at Yu Jing, “What are you trying to say?”

Yu Jing replied seriously, “He isn’t just an extraordinary genius, he’s definitely being backed by a mysterious power. Chaos is upon us. Dad, don’t you think we should become friends with more geniuses? We…”

The middle aged man waved his hand, “Stop! Stop beating around the bust. What are you trying to tell me?”

Yu Jing chuckled slyly and spoke seriously, “He’s causing trouble here because a friend of his is in the Sovereign of Sky’s hands. Her name is Zi’er, and she’s with that she-devil, Xiao Qi. Dad, I…”

The middle aged man asked, “You want me to save his friend?”

Yu Jing nodded, “Dad, you’re really smart. You figured it out so quickly. As expected of my father!”

“Shut up!” The middle aged man spoke in a low voice, “Do you know that doing this is equivalent to offending the Sovereign of Sky? Are you going to disregard the clan’s safety for your so-called loyalty?”

Yu Jing said, “Alright, alright. Even if our Yu Clan can’t be ranked in the top 3, it can enter the top 5 in the sky race, right? I refuse to believe that the Sovereign of Sky will offend our Yu Clan just because we want to save someone.”

The middle aged man shook his head, “And I won’t offend the Sovereign of Sky for someone who isn’t related to me. It’s not worth it!”

Yu Jing’s smile vanished, “If you refuse, then I’ll have to do it myself!”

“Don’t you dare!” The middle aged spoke angrily, “Do you want to be the next patriarch or not?”

“Who cares!” Yu Jing spoke loudly, “I’m your only damn son! If you don’t let me, then who? Let me tell you right now, I don’t care! If you refuse to do it, don’t even think about stopping me. I’m not the same anymore, so don’t force my hand. Otherwise, you’ll really lose face!”

“You!” The middle aged man’s face flushed red with rage.

Meanwhile, Yu Jing spoke softly, “Dad, just treat it as helping me, alright? Moreover, let me tell you something. I know my friend’s temper very well. If the Sovereign of Sky refuses to hand over his friend, then he’ll throw the entire Sky Dimension into chaos. I’m sure you’ve noticed that he isn’t looking for trouble with old fellows like you, and he’s targeting the younger generation. If I’m to be honest, I’m afraid there isn’t anyone in the sky race’s younger generation who can be a match for him.”

“That may not necessarily be the case!” The middle aged man spoke coldly, “According to my knowledge, the young captains of the Sky Guard aren’t weak at all. Moreover, those kids from the clans above our Yu Clan are extremely monstrous. There are even some monstrous geniuses who are in seclusion…”

“All of them are trash!” Yu Jing shrugged, “I’m not looking down on them, but he’s really strong. Right, do you know, he could fight the Blood Demon King, a Zen Realm expert, while he was at the 5th stage of the Enlightened Realm!”

The middle aged man frowned when he heard this, “Really?”

Yu Jing nodded, “The Blood Demon King treated him as an opponent in the same realm of cultivation! Moreover, he’s linked to that heaven defying monkey from the demon race. Besides that, you must not forget that he has a group of friends scattered throughout the races. All of them are extraordinary geniuses from the Dead Dimension, and the future will definitely belong to them. Dad, if you don’t become friends with them now and help them, it’ll be too late for our Yu Clan to make friends with them then!”

The middle aged man fell silent for a long time and said, “You’ve made your decision?”

Yu Jing nodded, “I have to help a friend in need.”

The middle aged man looked Yu Jing in the eyes, “If I refuse, you’ll use that thing your ancestor gave you, right?”

Yu Jing replied, “I will!”

The middle aged man sighed softly, “I never expected that you would become friends with a human. Moreover, that fellow can even make you do this.”

Yu Jing replied, “We were brothers who went through thick and thin in the Dead Dimension, and we’ll do the same in the outside world. Dad, just tell me if you’re going to help or not. If you refuse, I’ll save his friend and announce that I have no further link to the Yu Clan. I won’t drag the clan down with me! I’m not trying to threaten you!”

The middle aged man spoke in a low voice, “Is it really worth it? That thing is your final trump card, and it’s the guarantee that you’ll take over the Yu Clan. You must realize that while I only have a single son, your father’s father doesn’t have just a single son!”

Yu Jing didn’t say anything, and he just gazed at Yang Ye who was still in the arena, “Dad, do you understand what being brothers means?”
