Chapter 2314 – Beating Heart!

Just like that, Bai Zhixian watched with shock as Yang Ye took all the eternal treasures and put them away.

Bai Zhixian had quite a weird expression on her face.

Now, not to mention the slovenly old man, even she doubted that Yang Ye was really mad!

Would a madman pick up treasures like this?

Bai Zhixian walked over to Yang Ye and stared at him. He gazed at her with bewilderment. A short while passed before he put his arm around her waist, causing her to blush. She glared fiercely at him, and then she glanced at the surroundings, “Let’s leave first!”

She had a bad feeling as she stayed here.

Yang Ye took her hand and continued forward. As they walked, her face gradually became solemn.

Now, the corpses were fewer. However, there were some strange things around them instead. For example, a huge footprint that was almost 3km wide. It looked like a footprint, but it was more like an abyss. The space here too, it was like a void, a true void. Not the kind of dead space because that still had traces of space in it. However, the space here was truly just a void!

The world existed, and so did space, but that expanse of space didn’t exist anymore!

Bai Zhixian was unable to explain what it was!

Besides that, there was a stone statue of an unknown demon beast. It was lying on the ground and lacked one of its legs. Bai Zhixian was quite curious and wanted to have a look, but they were unable to go closer upon getting within 300m of it!

They couldn’t get closer!

It seemed like an invisible barrier stood before them, and it obstructed their path. However, they hadn’t been able to discover what exactly it was!

Tiny!

At this moment, Bai Zhixian suddenly felt tiny.

How huge was the universe?

It was boundless. The more humanity explored it, the tinier they felt.

They continued forward for another 15 minutes, and then a middle aged man on one knee appeared before them. There was a demon arm in front of him.

The middle aged man’s eyes were closed, and there were no signs of life coming from him.

Obviously, he’d died a long time ago.

Yang Ye and Bai Zhixian walked over to the middle aged man. There was a huge hole in his stomach, and it was empty within. As for the demon’s arm, it was holding a bunch of things.

Internal organs!

It was the middle aged man’s internal organs!

Bai Zhixian noticed that the heart was still beating in the arm’s grasp!

The sight of this made her expression change, and she hurriedly pulled Yang Ye back.

Bai Zhixian frowned, “What the heck is this place?”

Suddenly, Yang Ye pulled her toward the left, and he stopped after walking for quite some time. There was a corpse of a demon not too far ahead of them. It had the body of a tiger, wings on its back, and seven legs. At this moment, it was lying quietly on the ground without any signs of life coming from it. There were sabers at the top of its head and in its heart!

Both sabers were different!

The saber on its head seemed like it was covered in a dazzling pool of scarlet red blood. The blunt side of it was extremely thick, countless times thicker than an ordinary saber, but its blade was extremely thin, just like the wings of a cicada. There were two characters on its back ‘屠’ and ‘戮’, slaughter and kill.

Besides that, there was a thumb-sized pearl of blood at its hilt, and it frequently slid down the hilt to the blade. When it reached the tip of the blade, it continued back to the hilt, and continued in a cycle like that.

Tempering!

That was the term that Bai Zhixian thought of. The pearl of blood felt like it was tempering the saber! Because every single time it slid past the blade, the blade would undergo a minute change!

The saber at the demon’s heart was completely different from the saber on its head.

The saber there was much smaller than the other saber, but it was a little long. It was almost 1.5m long, and it was extremely thin. The entire saber was as thin as a razor, and it was extremely strange too. Because it seemed to turn invisible from time to time. When it was invisible, it was totally invisible, and its presence couldn’t be sensed at all; when it was visible, it emanated a ghastly aura that seemed like it would take someone’s head at any moment!

Two sabers!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly walked over to them.

Bai Zhixian frowned slightly and was about to stop him, but she seemed to have thought of something and stopped, “Be careful!”

They were clearly not ordinary sabers, so if they fell into Yang Ye’s hands, it would definitely be a very good thing.

However, Bai Zhixian was still quite worried, so she immediately followed him.

Just like that, they walked slowly toward the demon’s corpse. Yang Ye took Bai Zhixian with him as he leaped up above its head, and then he grabbed the saber’s hilt with both hands.

But it didn’t take long for him to frown.

He couldn’t draw it!

Yang Ye pulled with all his might, but no matter how hard he pulled, he couldn’t pull it out. A short while later, he suddenly drew his chopper and chopped at it!

Bai Zhixian was shocked and wanted to stop him, but it was too late. Yang Ye’s chopper slammed against the blood red saber.

Clang!

A clear clang resounded.

Bai Zhixian watched with shock as the chopper shattered into pieces!

She was stunned for quite a while before she said, “Impossible…”

The chopper in Yang Ye’s grasp was no ordinary chopper. After all, he had used it against the Skywalker Wolf without it getting damaged at all. Yet now, it had shattered!

Shattered into bits!

Yang Ye was quite stunned. His hand remained in that chopping motion for a long time, and then he gazed at Bai Zhixian. The latter rolled her eyes and said, “Why are you looking at me? Think of a solution yourself!”

Yang Ye turned around, and then a black sword appeared in his grasp!

The sword condensed from vengeful spirits!

Bai Zhixian’s expression changed. She hurriedly stopped him and glared at him, “Can you stop being so overbearing? You…”

Suddenly, the black sword surged into the blood red saber.

Bai Zhixian was stunned!

The vengeful spirits surged into the saber, and then it gradually started to tremble. A few breaths of time later, it transformed into a ray of blood red light that surged up into the sky, and then it descended back down and firmly embedded itself in the space before Yang Ye. There was a black vortex at its hilt, the vengeful spirits!

Bai Zhixian frowned at the sight of this, “How can this be? This saber had no spirit of its own? Or perhaps its spirit is gone, and then the vengeful spirits entered it and became its spirit?”

Yang Ye didn’t think too much about it. He grabbed it with his right hand, but just a moment later, his arm fell, and the saber descended upon the demon’s head.

It was too heavy!

Yang Ye grabbed the hilt with his left hand too and held on tight. At the same time, the vengeful spirits surrounded his hands, and then the saber was gradually lifted up!

Yang Ye’s knees were bent slightly while his veins had popped up throughout his arms, and his entire face was slightly red.

It was very strenuous!

While he’d succeeded at lifting it, it was extremely strenuous!

Bai Zhixian was extremely shocked by this scene. Yang Ye’s body was at the True Dao Realm, and his arms were at the peak of the True Dao Realm. It could be said that the strength in his arms was comparable to some True Void Realm experts, and he was even being assisted by the vengeful spirits. However, he was still barely able to lift it!

He was barely able to lift it, and that represented that he couldn’t use it at all!

A long time passed before Yang Ye put it down, and then it transformed into a ray of blood red light that entered his palm.

A tiny black and red mark appeared in his palm.

It was in the shape of the saber!

Yang Ye walked over to the demon’s stomach, and Bai Zhixian followed by his side. Just like that, they arrived before the second saber. Compared to the first, Bai Zhixian was fonder of the second. The previous saber was too bloody and filled with a baleful aura. Even though this saber emanated ghastly coldness too, there was no baleful aura coming from it. Moreover, it was thin as the wing of a cicada and extremely light. Unfortunately, she didn’t use the saber!

Yang Ye stretched out his hand and grabbed its hilt before pulling lightly.

Hiss!

The saber was instantly pulled out, but just a moment later, it shook violently and was about to struggle free from Yang Ye’s grasp. Suddenly, Yang Ye frowned and circulated the Profound Primal Energy within him. As soon as his Profound Primal Energy surged into the saber, it actually started to calm down!

“What?” Bai Zhixian was quite puzzled. The saber had been about to struggle free of Yang Ye”s grasp, but it had actually calmed down now.

Bai Zhixian spoke softly, “Is it connected to the Primal Saber Sect?”

Meanwhile, Yang Ye waved the saber gently.

Hiss!

An expanse of saber energy rippled out. Everywhere it passed, space rippled like water, and the saber energy shot soundlessly into the ground over 1km away. An extremely thin cut that was as thin as the wing of a cicada could be seen on the ground, but it was so thin that it was impossible to notice if one didn’t look carefully. Or perhaps it should be said that it was so thin that the ground didn’t look any different!

“What a saber!” Bai Zhixian had a wisp of happiness in her eyes. She didn’t know how strong the blood red saber was, but this one in Yang Ye’s grasp wasn’t weak at all. It could be said that if Yang Ye fought the Skywalker Wolf now, he would absolutely be able to fight it. Because this saber was very likely to be able to pierce through the Skywalker Wolf’s defenses. So long as he could accomplish that, Yang Ye had a chance at victory, even without playing any tricks!

Bai Zhixian seemed to have thought of something. She took the saber in Yang Ye’s grasp and wrapped it around his waist.

It fit perfectly!

It was like a jade belt that coiled around Yang Ye’s waist, and it didn’t look out of place at all!

Bai Zhixian grinned and gazed at Yang Ye, “Let’s go!”

Yang Ye took Bai Zhixian’s hand and leaped down the corpse, and then they continued further forward.

Once they vanished into the distance, a pair of footprints appeared abruptly on the corpse.

“Hehehe…” Laughter suddenly resounded here.DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎
