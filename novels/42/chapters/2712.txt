Chapter 2713 – I Convince People with Virtue!

A familiar voice!

Yang Ye stopped and looked over. There was a woman standing to his right.

An Nanjing!

It was An Nanjing who had been gone for quite some time!

Yang Ye was stunned for a moment, and then he cracked a smile, “You’re here!”

An Nanjing nodded and walked over to Yang Ye’s side.

Both of them gazed at the middle aged man.

The middle aged man sized up An Nanjing, and his eyes narrowed slightly.

Meanwhile, they didn’t waste their breath and just vanished on the spot.

The middle aged man’s expression changed slightly.

He overlapped his hands and slammed them forward.

The space before him cracked open and was obliterated!

Meanwhile, a spear tore through space and arrived before him.

Dagger-Axe!

An Nanjing’s Dagger-Axe stabbed directly against the man’s palm, but it couldn’t pierce through his palm. The middle aged man had forcefully stopped it! Moreover, Dagger-Axe instantly curved!

However, the middle aged man’s pupils suddenly constricted. He hurriedly pulled his hands back because a sword had soundlessly arrived behind him.

The middle aged man reacted very quickly. He pressed his arms together and clamped down on the sword, but a spear stabbed at him from behind!

A ferocious expression appeared on his face as he released the sword and flashed 300m away.

However, a strand of blood sprayed from his left shoulder.

As soon as the middle aged man stopped there, Yang Ye and An Nanjing were in front of him!

The sword stabbed forward!

The spear swept horizontally!

An Nanjing and Yang Ye’s figures crisscrossed incessantly. In an instant, the middle aged man was surrounded by countless spear and sword images.

Suppression!

Utter suppression!

At this moment, the middle aged man couldn’t even fight back!

In the younger generation, An Nanjing was probably the only one capable of fighting Yang Ye in closed quartered combat. She was the only one who was on par with him and even surpassed him!

Now, An Nanjing had returned even stronger than before!

Her joint forces with Yang Ye…

The middle aged man was pushed back repeatedly. In just around ten breaths of time, countless sword and spear injuries had appeared all around him.

However, the middle aged man’s strength was clearly extremely terrifying. While more and more injuries were appearing on him, they weren’t lethal!

Just like that, around ten minutes passed.

Suddenly, the middle aged man gave up defending himself against the spear striking his chest!

The spear pierced through him!

At practically the exact same moment, a sword sliced at his throat!

The middle aged man ignored the sword because as soon as the spear struck him, he’d relied on the force within it to retreat rapidly!

His retreat allowed him to dodge Yang Ye’s attack while creating distance between him and them!

Once he’d retreated, the middle aged man turned around and vanished on the spot!

He'd fled decisively!

An Nanjing was about to pursue him, but Yang Ye shook his head.

She gazed at him, and he said softly, “We can’t catch up to him.”

An Nanjing nodded and looked into the distance. A black shadow had appeared there.

She spoke softly, “Thank you!”

It was the black shadow that had gotten her here!

The black shadow spoke softly, “You have to go down the rest of your path on your own.”

She gazed at it, and it grinned, “Actually, I’m very satisfied already.”

The black shadow gazed at Yang Ye and continued, “Actually, I should thank you!”

Yang Ye was quite puzzled.

The black shadow explained, “I wouldn’t have been able to get out without you.”

Yang Ye finally understood.

Snowy and Erya had gotten the black shadow out that day, and the woman in black hadn’t stopped them. In the beginning, he thought the black shadow and the woman in black were on the same side, but now it would seem like…

The black shadow seemed to be aware of what Yang Ye was thinking and said, “We aren’t enemies. After all, we have a greatest enemy then. However, we aren’t friends either. Be careful of the strongest form of Destiny. She has the most extreme thoughts, and her strength is the most terrifying. Yang Busi was unmatched in the world, yet lost to her in the end… Haha, actually, practically everyone from our era lost at her hands!”

Yang Ye spoke solemnly, “How terrifying would she be if they merged into one?”

The black shadow fell silent for a moment and said, “She had completely surpassed the Heaven Dao then. Now that so many years have passed, and all her clones have been cultivating on their own… It’s a cultivation technique of hers that she created herself…”

He shook his head slightly and said, “Actually, she is very mysterious even to us. All I do know is that countless challenged her all those years ago, but all of us failed.”

Yang Ye fell silent.

The shadow continued, “All four forms of Destiny have their own personality. Now it seems like the women in white and black think highly of you, but Tu and the last one are existences you must be careful of. Especially their strongest form.”

Yang Ye nodded, “Thank you for the reminder.”

The shadow gazed at An Nanjing, “My path was at its end all those years ago, and I hope you can go further than me!”

His figure gradually turned ethereal.

An Nanjing bowed respectfully like a disciple as she stood by Yang Ye’s side.

A breath of time later, the black shadow had vanished completely.

Truly vanished!

Yang Ye gazed at An Nanjing, and she fell silent for a long time before she gazed at him, “Where are you going?”

Yang Ye looked toward the distance, “The border of the Four Dimensional Universe.”

She nodded and entered the Primordial Pagoda.

In the Primordial Pagoda, Snowy appeared before her. Snowy cracked a smile at An Nanjing, but An Nanjing remained indifferent.

Snowy was a little afraid.

Suddenly, she rubbed Snowy’s head and went to the cultivation room.

Snowy blinked, and then she quickly followed An Nanjing.

An Nanjing was still the same!

Outside the Primordial Pagoda, Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings. In the end, he fell silent for a long time and said, “Maybe we shouldn’t go there for now?”

An Nanjing appeared before him.

Yang Ye spoke softly, “Tu bullies me, the strongest form of destiny bullied me, and all of these bastards are bullying me too. I feel like a ball that all of them can just kick around.”

He gazed at her and said, “I feel increasingly furious the more I think about it.”

An Nanjing nodded, “Kill them!”

Yang Ye took a deep breath, “All of them think I will run, but I’m not going to do that. Come! Let’s go kill them all!”

Yang Ye took her hand and traveled downward.

In the Primordial Pagoda.

Snowy gazed at the shattered armor, blinked, and then touched it gently. A moment later, countless strands of spirit energy converged into it, and then it actually started to heal…

If the middle aged man from before witnessed this scene, he would probably have an interesting reaction to it!

Snowy was like a mender, no she was one, and she was the best in the world!

In just a short while, the shattered armor had been fully repaired!

Now, it was truly like new.

Once she finished mending it, Snowy hurried out of the pagoda with it and passed it to Yang Ye while her chubby face was covered in a brilliant smile.

An Nanjing and Yang Ye exchanged glances, and they saw smiles in each other’s eyes. Yang Ye took the armor and passed it to her, but she shook her head. Yang Ye insisted, but she insisted as well!

Yang Ye felt quite helpless.

An Nanjing spoke softly, “They are targeting you, so it may be useful at the critical moment for you!”

She glanced at Yang Ye and continued, “Wear it!”

Yang Ye didn’t linger on the topic. He took the armor and gazed at Snowy with a smile, “Little fellow, you’re amazing!”

He was speaking from the heart.

Snowy’s abilities were truly extraordinary!

Fortunately, Snowy was on his side!

Snowy gazed at Yang Ye, and her smile grew even wider.

Yang Ye chuckled, and then he took Snowy in his arms before vanishing from the spatial passageway with An Nanjing!

It was difficult to head upward, but it was very easy to travel down. In just a short while, they’d returned to the 9th layer of space!

An Nanjing asked softly, “What do we do?”

He glanced at the surroundings and grinned, “It’s time to make them learn.”

He withdrew a transmission rock, sent his profound energy into it, and then a voice came from within it, “Brother Yang.”

Yang Ye nodded slightly, “Where are they living after I destroyed the End World?”

The voice fell silent for a short while and asked, “You plan to counterattack?”

Yang Ye nodded, “Sort of.”

The voice fell silent for a moment. In the end, a ray of white light flashed out of the transmission rock, “They are still there. They repaired the shattered space there. However, they have many, many more formations there now. All of them were set up by old geezers who are skilled in the art of formations. You must be careful!”

Formations!

Yang Ye was stunned for a moment, and then he gazed at Snowy and shook his head while smiling, “It seems I have to be careless!”Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

As he spoke, he vanished on the spot with Snowy and An Nanjing.

The End Dimension.

A short while later, Yang Ye and Snowy arrived at the End World!

He’d just entered directly!

As for An Nanjing, she didn’t show herself. She was a trump card that was best used at the critical moment!

As soon as Yang Ye arrived, his arrival alarmed the experts of the End World, and then countless auras swept over from all directions. At the same time, a huge formation soundlessly appeared below him. Meanwhile, the stars in space actually automatically started to move.

Formations!

Moreover, there were at least around ten of them that had activated swiftly!

They activated simultaneously, and they could even annihilate a peak Destiny Realm expert with ease!

Yang Ye walked toward the distance with Snowy in his arms. He glanced at the surroundings and smiled, “I heard you repaired this place. Right, don’t get anxious, I always win people over with virtue!”

Yang Ye suddenly vanished on the spot once he finished speaking.

Around 1km to the left, a black shadow shot toward the sky, but the ray of sword energy was faster than him!

Hiss!

The sword energy flashed through the black shadow’s throat!

The sword energy dispersed to reveal Yang Ye’s figure behind the black shadow. Yang Ye sheathed his sword and lightly lifted up the black shadow’s head. Just like that, it was lifted up.

Blood sprayed out like a fountain!

Yang Ye glanced at the head in his grasp and sighed softly, “Sorry, I wasn’t able to control myself! Sigh, I wonder when I’ll be able to fix my tendency to kill!”
