Chapter 1009 – A Saint Realm Sword Servant!

10 Saints!

That was no joke! The academy only had 4 Saints now, and all of them were heavily injured. Under such circumstances, the academy didn’t have the slightest chance to win!

In other words, he, the dean of the academy, might be killed at any moment!

Instructor Zhuo fell silent for a long time upon hearing Yang Ye, and then he said, “You can quit if you want. Just tell it to Brother Shang. We won’t object if he agrees!”

The corners of Yang Ye’s mouth twitched, and quite some time passed before he laughed bitterly, “Fine, you win. But the situation we’re facing now is really quite bad. Sky Divine Hall will definitely not spare us, and they’ll definitely attack us if they have the chance. As for the Dao Order, it’ll definitely not let the matter rest because of me. Coupled with the Law Faction of White Deer Academy, we can be said to be at risk of annihilation at any time!”

Instructor Zhuo pondered deeply for a moment before he said, “You’re the dean, so you make the decisions!”

Yang Ye’s face darkened. That damnable old man is being so shameless!

Meanwhile, Yu Wushuang spoke, “Actually, we aren’t in a hopeless situation yet!”

Yang Ye asked, “What do you mean?”

She pondered deeply for a moment and said, “The Law Faction of White Deer Academy wants to crush us, and as those who oppose them, the Scholarly Faction would definitely not allow them to succeed. If the Scholarly Faction allowed it, then they wouldn’t have snuck to Pine Prefecture and played such tricks. They would have openly dispatched experts to obliterate us!”

“If you intend to rely on the Scholarly Faction, then you can discard that thought!” Instructor Zhuo spoke solemnly, “They are willing to give us a chance, but we haven’t been able to grasp that opportunity throughout these years. So, many of them are actually disappointed in us, and they are so disappointed that they’ve stopped to pay attention to us. Moreover, they would definitely not act against the Law Faction even if they knew that the Law Faction had acted against us. Because we have no value to them, nor is fighting the Law Faction for us worth it to them!”

“Senior, I’ve actually guessed all of that!” Yu Wushuang continued, “I’m not talking about relying on the Scholarly Faction. At the very least, we can’t rely on the Scholarly Faction for now, nor are we able to.”

Instructor Zhuo said, “Be frank!”

Yu Wushuang nodded, “The Endless Devil Sect and Sky Divine Hall are sworn enemies. However, its sworn enemy, the Endless Devil Sect, didn’t show any signs of movement when a huge number of experts left Sky Divine Hall to attack us. Don’t you think that it’s strange?”

Yang Ye frowned, “You’re saying that the Endless Devil Sect might have been warned not to do anything by the Law Faction?” Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“It’s not a possibility, it’s certain!” Yu Wushuang continued, “Sky Divine Hall had dared to openly dispatch its elites here. That proved they were sure that the Endless Devil Sect wouldn’t dare to attack them. But they don’t have the strength to make the Endless Devil Sect dare not attack them. So, the only explanation is that the Law Faction of White Deer Academy interfered!”

A grin curled up on the corners of Yu Wushuang’s mouth when she spoke up to this point, “Just think about it. If you were the Endless Devil Sect, then would you be willing to accept that?”

“I wouldn’t!” Instructor Zhuo spoke solemnly, “However, would they dare to fight back against the Law Faction of White Deer Academy? Even though it doesn’t represent the entirety of White Deer Academy, their strength still isn’t something that a tiny sect like the Endless Devil Sect can resist.”

“Senior, you’re absolutely right!” Yu Wushuang smiled, “However, if you were the Sect Master of the Endless Devil Sect, would you just watch as Sky Divine Hall continued to grow stronger? Would you be willing to be controlled by the Law Faction or even threatened by them? So long as there’s unwillingness and resentment in their hearts, then we would have a chance!”

Instructor Zhuo asked, “To form an alliance with the Endless Devil Sect?”

Yu Wushuang nodded and said, “Regardless of whether it’s our academy or the Endless Devil Sect, we’re unable to resist the Law Faction on our own. Not to mention that it has the Python Clan, Steel Ape Clan, and Sky Divine Hall obeying its commands. The only way to go against them is to join forces. In that way, we would still have a chance at survival!”

Instructor Zhuo spoke in a low voice, “I’ll head to the Endless Devil Sect!”

Yu Wushuang shook her head and said, “We can’t go to them!”

Instructor Zhuo was puzzled, “Why?”

She answered, “Because if we are to take the initiative, then we’ll fall into a passive position while facing them. We have to wait for them to come looking for us.”

Instructor Zhuo said, “What if they don’t come?”

She spoke with absolute certainty, “Unless the Endless Devil Sect’s Master is good for nothing, they’ll definitely send someone to meet us!”

Instructor Zhuo gazed at her for a long time before he grinned, “Little Girl, you really aren’t bad at all.”

She nodded slightly in a neither humble or proud manner.

“What about the Dao Order?” Instructor Zhuo continued, “We killed one of their Saints and Qing Daofu. Based on the way they do things, the Dao Order will definitely not let the matter rest.”

“They have 3 choices!” She answered solemnly, “The first is to disregard everything and fight us to the death. The second choice is to let bygones be bygones, make peace with us, and work together once more. The third choice is to do nothing, wait for an opportunity, and strike a killing blow at a critical period!”

Instructor Zhuo said, “They might choose the 3rd option!”

Yu Wushuang nodded in response, “So, we absolutely can’t give them a chance to do that. So long as we form an alliance with the Endless Devil Sect and the Ancient Sword School, then they wouldn’t dare act against us at all. Unless they choose to side with Sky Divine Hall. But we have no need to fear them even if they do side with Sky Divine Hall. Because Sky Divine Hall is too far away from here. Coupled with the fact that we have the Endless Devil Sect to help us, the Sky Divine Hall wouldn’t be able to help them at all.”

Instructor Zhuo turned to look at Yang Ye and asked, “What do you think?”

Yang Ye shook his head slightly and said, “We’ll do as Wushuang said!”

Instructor Zhuo nodded and said, “Then we’ll wait for the Endless Devil Sect’s arrival!”

Before long, Instructor Zhuo, Yu Wushuang, and the others left the hall, and only Yang Ye and Shang Qingying remained here.

Yang Ye gazed at her for a long time and said, “I’m not really good at consoling others. All I want to say is that if you want to take revenge, then you have to work hard on becoming stronger!”

Yang Ye turned around and walked away once he finished speaking.

Shang Qingying suddenly said, “You’ll be heading to the Central Divine Prefecture to participate in the competition, right?”

Yang Ye stopped and said, “Even though I don’t feel any connection to the old man, I feel that White Deer Academy has to give us an explanation for his death!”

Yang Ye walked out of the hall once he finished speaking.

Shang Qingying clenched her fists as she stood there in the hall, and a long time passed before she said, “They have to give us an explanation! They must give me an explanation!”

...

After he returned to Cloud Ocean Pavilion, Yang Ye locked himself within his room. Qing and Hong were standing before him, and Hong was here because he’d asked Qing to bring her here!

Yang Ye glanced at Hong, and the latter glared at him before moving her gaze away. Obviously, she was still angry at him for not giving her a violet crystal that day.

Yang Ye disregarded her and just looked directly at Qing, “I can help her attain the Saint Realm, but I have the same conditions as before. She must help me 3 times. I don’t like to negotiate. Agree and I’ll give her a violet crystal right now; refuse and she can leave right now.”

“She agrees!” Qing hurriedly said, “Don’t worry. Both she and I won’t go back on our word. I can guarantee that.”

Yang Ye nodded and flicked a violet crystal over to Qing. Hong’s gaze instantly descended upon it, and there was a trace of green in her eyes.

Yang Ye suddenly asked, “You’re from the Python Clan?”

Qing nodded and said, “But don’t worry, we have no connection to the Python Clan anymore. Because we’ve been expelled from the clan by its current patriarch! If it wasn’t for that, we sisters wouldn’t have gone to such a remote place to hide.”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Expelled? Why?”

Qing pondered deeply for a moment before she explained, “My father was the past patriarch of the Python Clan, but both of us hadn’t attained the Saint Realm before he fell. It’s utterly impossible for the Python Clan to let a weakling assume the position of patriarch, so it was seized by my uncle. He’d intended to kill us sisters, but many Saints in the clan used to be my father’s subordinates, and they didn’t allow him to do so. So, he didn’t dare to kill us in the end and could only expel us!”

“So that’s what happened!” Yang Ye nodded. He remained silent for a long time before he suddenly said, “Do you want to take it back from your uncle?”

Both of them were slightly stunned, and then excitement surged within their eyes as Qing spoke in a trembling voice, “You’re willing to help us?”

If it was in the past, she would naturally not dare to hold any hopes. But now, Yang Ye was the dean of Ocean of Clouds Academy and a disciple of the Ancient Sword School. He had the backing of the Saints from both powers. If the Saints of both powers were included, then she did have the chance to reclaim control over the Python Clan!

“I can try!” said Yang Ye. If he were to help them reclaim power over the Python Clan, then it would definitely be a good thing for the academy. Because it would be equivalent to having one less formidable enemy and one more ally.

Qing guaranteed, “We’ll definitely repay you if you help us!”

Yang Ye said, “We’ll talk about that in the future. The important matter at hand is for your sister to attain the Saint Realm. We’ll have a higher chance at success once she has attained the Saint Realm as well.”

Qing nodded and said, “You’re right. I’ll take her to cultivate and charge into the Saint Realm right now!”

Qing took Hong’s hand and vanished on the spot.

“How impatient!” Yang Ye shook his head slightly, and then he waved his right hand. Zhu Yuan’s corpse appeared in front of him.

“A true Saint Realm Sword Servant....” Yang Ye started to refine Zhu Yuan’s corpse once he finished speaking.
