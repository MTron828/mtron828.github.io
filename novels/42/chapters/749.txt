Chapter 750 – All Of You Can’t Afford To Do So!

This time, Yang Ye felt a chill run down his spine.

He could accept that Half-Saints weren’t able to see her because he’d killed many Half-Saints himself. So, they weren’t that mighty in his opinion. But it was quite terrifying that even Nether Maiden couldn’t.

“Let’s go!” Nether Maiden shot towards the distance once she finished speaking. Meanwhile, Wang Yan and Qing Ming glanced at Yang Ye before they left.

Once Nether Maiden and the others left, Yin’yin suddenly said, “Big Brother, that big sister was lying!”

“She was lying?” Yang Ye was puzzled, “What do you mean?”

Yin’yin grinned and said, “She could see Yin’yin.”

Yang Ye’s expression changed slightly. So she could see Yin’yin, then why did she act like she couldn’t?

Meanwhile, Yin’yin continued, “Big Brother, you have to be careful while you’re by her side.”

“Why?” asked Yang Ye.

“She isn’t alive!” Yin’yin said, “There’s no vitality in her, nor does she possess the aura of a human. Moreover, her lifespan should have been exhausted a very long time ago.”

“Then why is she still alive?” asked Yang Ye.

Yin’yin grinned and said, “Reversal of Yin and Yang!”

“Reversal of Yin and Yang?” Yang Ye frowned.

Yin’yin walked over to Yang Ye and said, “Big Brother, do you know that besides people Yin’yin allows to see Yin’yin, there are only 2 other types of people who can see Yin’yin. The first are those very formidable people, and the second are those who aren’t alive. That big sister from before was part of the latter. Big Brother, do you know which type you are?”

“Didn’t you allow me to see you?” Yang Ye was puzzled.

She shook her head in response, “It was me in the beginning because I was hungry. But I didn’t allow you to see me just now. But you were still able to see me!”

A drop of cold sweat emerged from Yang Ye’s forehead when he heard this, and he gulped down a mouthful of saliva before he said, “Don’t tell me that I’m not alive as well!”

Yin’yin said, “You’re definitely alive. Because you have the aura of a human and vitality. But you’re clearly very weak, so why can you see me? It’s so strange!

Very weak.... Yang Ye’s mouth twitched. He hesitated for a moment and asked, “How strong are you?” It was something he really wanted to find out.

“Very!”

“How much is very?”

She blinked and said, “I can eat up everyone in this city!”

Yang Ye was speechless.

Yin’yin grinned, and then she walked over to the Tower of Buddha. She turned around to look at Yang Ye when she arrived at its entrance, and she said, “Big Brother, you can come play with me in the future, and it’ll be even better if you bring more food for me!” She turned around and walked into the tower.

Yang Ye stared blankly for a long time on the spot.

At this moment, his mind was in slight chaos. So Nether Maiden isn’t alive? Then what is she? A soul? What’s that reversal of Yin and Yang that she spoke about? Why was I able to see Yin’yin? Yang Ye couldn’t wrap his head around it no matter how he racked his brains, and Yin’yin clearly had no intention to tell him the answer.

Yang Ye remained silent for a while before he vanished on the spot.

After he left Nameless City, Yang Ye saw Nether Maiden, but Wang Yan and Qing Ming weren’t with her.

“They’ve gone ahead!” said Nether Maiden.

Yang Ye nodded and said, “Let’s go!”

She suddenly said, “Aren’t you going to ask me why?”

Yang Ye shook his head and said, “You would tell me if you were willing to. Otherwise, it’s pointless for me to ask.”

She suddenly said, “Don’t come into contact with her in the future!”

“Why?” asked Yang Ye.

She fell silent for a short while before she said, “She’s very dangerous. If she wanted to kill you, then you wouldn’t be able to resist at all with the strength you possess right now.”

Yang Ye gazed at Nether Maiden as he asked, “Is that the true reason?”

Nether Maiden remained silent for a long time before she spoke, “I presume you’ve figured out her origins. Yes, she’s from the Outer Heavens. I can only say that most of the people from the Outer Heavens are pitiable people, and it’s exactly because they are pitiable that they are terrifying. Because most of their minds have warped. Their moods change erratically, and they are extremely strong. So, you might die at any moment while in contact with such people!”

Yang Ye fell silent for a while before he said, “Thank you for the warning. I’ll keep it in mind. Let’s go!”

She glanced at him, and then didn’t speak another word. She just flew into the air and Yang Ye followed behind her.

Two hours later, their group of 4 finally arrived at the Netherworld Ocean.

As he stood at the shoreside and gazed at the ocean, Yang Ye couldn’t help but frown. The ocean was simply boundless. There was no wind or waves to be seen, and it was like a pool of deathly still water. Most importantly, the ocean water was dark blue.

Meanwhile, Nether Maiden flicked with her finger, and a ray of white light flashed. After that, 2 golden talismans appeared before each of them. She said, “One of them is a Five Element Divine Talisman, and it’s capable of improving your strength, speed, and defenses by 5 times for 2 hours. It won’t be a problem for each of you to keep 3 Half-Saints busy during those 2 hours, right?”

“No problem!” Wang Yan was the first to speak.

“No!” Qing Ming spoke right after.

Yang Ye gazed at the golden talisman in his hand, and then he shook his head. If he only had to keep 3 Half-Saints busy and not kill them while his strength, speed, and defense were increased by 5 times, then it wasn’t a huge problem at all.

Nether Maiden nodded and said, “The other talisman is a Substitute Talisman, and it allows you to summon a substitute puppet to take your place at a dangerous moment. It’s able to absorb 50% of the damage you suffer. So, I presume that unless you encounter one of the supreme experts of this world, any other expert wouldn’t be able to kill any of you with a single strike while you have it in your possession. Of course, it can only be used once!”

All of them were visibly moved. What did its ability to absorb 50% of the damage they received mean? It meant exactly what Nether Maiden had said. Unless they encountered a supreme expert of this world, there was absolutely no one who could kill them with a single attack. On the other hand, in Yang Ye’s opinion, even a supreme expert might not be able to kill him with a single attack. Because his physical defenses were already heaven defying!

Nether Maiden continued, “Our mission this time can be said to be very simple, yet it can also be said to be extremely difficult. Because we’ll be considered to have completed our mission if we’re able to figure out the origins of those stone coffins or take them back with us. However, I presume all of you should be clearly aware that it definitely won’t go smoothly.”

“You wouldn’t have asked us to come with you if it was simple.” Wang Yan said, “Your highness, enormous benefits are naturally accompanied by enormous danger. We understand that.”

Swish! Swish! Swish!

Suddenly, four figures whistled through the air, and then 3 men and a woman appeared before Yang Ye’s group. The man who led the group was slightly stunned when he saw Yang Ye and the others, and his gaze swept past them before finally descending onto Nether Maiden. He said, “You’re Nether Maiden from the Hallowed Halls, right?”

Nether Maiden nodded lightly.

“So you are that Nether Maiden who’s ranked at the 1st position on the Hallowed Rankings!” The robust man who stood at the side of the man who led the group suddenly laughed coldly, “They say that you’re the number one genius in the Hallowed Grounds. I, Man Li, am very doubtful of that. Why don’t we have a spar?”

Nether Maiden frowned slightly. Meanwhile, Wang Yan said, “The man in the lead is from the Dragon Race, and his name is Long Xuan. He’s the number one genius of the Dragon Race and has once eaten a human Half-Saint. That fellow on his left is Man Li from the Man Clan, and he has killed a human Half-Saint on his own as well. The man on Long Xuan’s right is Lei Huan from the Lei Clan, and he has killed a Half-Saint on his own as well. As for that woman, I’ve never seen her before!”

Yang Ye’s heart shook when he heard Wang Yan. At this moment, he realized that the monstrous geniuses of the Hallowed Grounds were much more numerous than he’d imagined, and they were much stronger as well!

It wasn’t just their geniuses, even the true strength of the entire Hallowed Grounds was much more formidable than he’d imagined. He’d originally thought that he had a very good chance at rescuing the Sword Spirit’s main body, but now he realized that even if he could head to the Pagoda of Confinement, his current strength was probably utterly insufficient. Perhaps he might even lose his life there! Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

I’m still not strong enough!Of course, the matter of rescuing the Sword Precursor could allow no delay as well.

At this moment, Yang Ye had decided that once he was done here and obtained the points from the mission, he would make his Sword Servant, Guardian Lin, become a mid-grade Half-Saint no matter the cost, and then immediately head to the Pagoda of Confinement.

Yang Ye became quite impatient when he thought about earning points, and he gazed at Nether Maiden and said, “Should we head down?” So long as they completed the mission, they would be able to obtain 100,000 points at least, and that would be sufficient for him to head to the Pagoda of Confinement.

Nether Maiden clearly had no interest in Long Xuan’s group, so she immediately nodded and said, “Let’s go!”

“Stop right there!” Right when they intended to head down into the ocean, Man Li suddenly laughed coldly and said, “Are you going to be that rude?”

Yang Ye was quite speechless when he heard this and said, “Hey, are you looking for trouble?”

Man Li laughed coldly and said, “You can think of it like that if you want.”

Yang Ye was quite stunned. He’d clearly not expected these fellows to look for trouble with them. Meanwhile, Wang Yan suddenly said, “The other races are quite hostile to us humans. So, if we humans encounter the members of the other races, then it would mostly cause some conflict to arise.”

“That’s racism!” Yang Ye finally came to an understanding. He didn’t speak further and just gazed at Nether Maiden. In any case, she was leading the group.

Nether Maiden clearly didn’t want to waste time, so she disregarded Man Li’s group, turned around, and walked towards the ocean. Yang Ye and the others naturally followed behind her.

“As expected, humans are cowards!” Meanwhile, Man Li suddenly laughed with ridicule.

Long Xuan who stood by Man Li’s side remained silent, and there was only a mocking smile on his face.

Nether Maiden still didn’t stop.

The smile of ridicule on the corners of Man Li’s mouth grew wider when he witnessed this, and he said, “So the human race is filled with such cowards. I’ve already said so much yet all of you are actually not angry. Were all of you brought up by weak and lowly dogs?”

This time, Nether Maiden and the others stopped simultaneously.

Excitement appeared on Man Li’s face when he saw this scene, and he said, “You’re angry? Good! Come on! Let’s have some fun!”

“All of you can’t afford to do so!” Nether Maiden finally spoke.

1. Well apparently the Man Clan is not human since they have a special physique as noted in an earlier chapter
