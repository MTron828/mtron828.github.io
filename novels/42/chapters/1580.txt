Chapter 1581 - Just Do Your Best!

Translator: InVader

Admiration!

At this moment, Yang Ye simply admired Little Sky to the absolute limit!

Who was the woman with a feather fan? She was one of the two Nether Envoys!

He didn’t know what it meant to be a Nether Envoy, but he knew that Blood Maiden and the others had almost been annihilated by her. Besides that, the one-armed man, the one-armed woman, and the middle aged man with a spear on his back were willingly addressing her as their master. So, how strong would she be?

Yet now, Little Sky was openly provoking her, and she was doing it without holding back at all. Little Sky didn’t give her any face!

Yang Ye wasn’t the only one who felt this way, the others were stunned too.

Obviously, they hadn’t expected that Little Sky would do that.

Suddenly, Yang Ye tried to stir up trouble, “Little Sky, don’t make things difficult for her. She definitely wouldn’t dare to fight here. How could she dare to do that? Isn’t that no different than courting death?”

Even though he said that, he was actually shouting madly in his heart. Attack! Attack!

He really wanted Fan Yinyu to attack Little Sky. If she did, Little Sky would definitely call for help or even unseal her ability to fight. But if Fan Yinyu didn’t fight Blood Maiden and the others here, then Little Sky may not help!

Even though he had quite a good relationship with Little Sky, she was someone who had principles. So, if he wanted her to help, the only way was for Fan Yinyu to attack Little Sky!

Fan Yinyu didn’t speak. The middle aged man with a spear on his back was about to attack Little Sky, but Fan Yinyu suddenly shook her head slightly.

The middle aged man immediately stepped back when he saw Fan Yinyu shake her head.

Fan Yinyu looked Little Sky in the eyes. She looked at her for a long time before she suddenly frowned, “I once obtained a treasure, and it gave me some powers. Powers to see fragments of the future. Up until now, there are only two people in this world who I can’t see through at all. One of them is you.” She glanced at Yang Ye and continued, “The other one is you!”

Yang Ye shrugged. Obviously, it was the Primordial Pagoda that caused that.

Fan Yinyu gazed at Little Sky, “Have we met? Why do you feel quite familiar?”

“I don’t know!” Little Sky moved back to Yang Ye’s side, and then she glanced at the surroundings, “If you humans want to fight, it’s your own business. However, this world belongs to all the living beings that live here. You can’t destroy it at will. If you want to fight, head to outer space, and create a spatial battlefield. You can fight as you please there. But not here!”

Meanwhile, Fan Yinyu chuckled, “What does this world have to do with me?”

Yang Ye was slightly stunned, and then he felt delighted. She’s infuriating Little Sky on purpose! But that’s good. It’s exactly what I want.

Everyone here gazed at Little Sky.

Little Sky looked the woman in the eyes, and then she tapped her right foot down lightly. After that, she looked up and shouted, “Show yourself!”

The sky suddenly split apart, and then a huge eye emerged from the crack. Once it arrived, it immediately locked onto Fan Yinyu.

The Eye of the Heaven Dao!

Everyone here exchanged glances. Besides Yang Ye and Blood Maiden, all the others hadn’t imagined that Little Sky could actually summon the Eye of the Heaven Dao.

Fan Yinyu’s eyes narrowed slightly. She gazed at Little Sky for a long time, and then she shook her head, “If it’s your trump card, then I can only say that you’re going to be disappointed.”

Little Sky gazed at the Eye of the Heaven Dao in the sky, “Get help.”

The Eye of the Heaven Dao shook violently, and then the space throughout the sky started to tremble violently. After that, Eyes of the Heaven Dao appeared in succession from within space. In just a short while, the entire sky was filled with them.

At this moment, the expressions of everyone here had changed.

In the sky, there were over a hundred Eyes of the Heaven Dao, and more and more were still arriving.

Little Sky gazed at Fan Yinyu, “Is it enough now?”

Fan Yinyu gazed at the sky for a long time. In the end, she seemed to have thought of something, and she nodded slightly before looking at Little Sky, “I think I know who you are.”

“Who?!” It was Yang Ye who asked this question. He’d wanted to know her identity for a long time.

Fan Yinyu paid no attention to Yang Ye. She gazed at Little Sky for a long time before she chuckled, “I’ll give you face.” As soon as she finished speaking, she gazed at Blood Maiden and the others, “Come, let’s fight in outer space.”

“Wait!” Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly stepped forward and looked Fan Yinyu in the eyes, “Where’s Zi’er?”

“I almost forgot!” Fan Yinyu nodded slightly, and then she waved her hand. A ray of violet light instantly flashed out from the bamboo house, and then it dispersed to reveal Zi’er’s figure.

Zi’er immediately pounced into Yang Ye’s arms when she saw him, “Snowy… Snowy is…”

Yang Ye took a deep breath and spoke softly, “Don’t worry. She’s fine now.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he gazed at Fan Yinyu, “I expected you to threaten me with her!”

“Threaten you?” Fan Yinyu grinned, “Do I need to threaten someone at the Dualism Realm? Yang Ye, your natural talent isn’t bad, and your strength isn’t bad either. In ten years from now, no one here would be a match for you. However, it isn’t your time to be matchless throughout the world now. You can only be a bystander in the battle that’ll be carried out today.”

Yang Ye said, “No matter what, I’m going to avenge Shaoyao myself today.”

Fan Yinyu nodded slightly, “Feel free to try.” As soon as she finished speaking, she gazed at Blood Maiden and the others, “Come, let’s put an end to everything today.”

As soon as she finished speaking, her figure shot up into the sky. The man with a spear on his back and both the one-armed man and woman followed closely behind her.

Blood Maiden gazed at Yang Ye, “She’s right. Your strength isn’t sufficient. Moreover, it’s our Nether Pavilion’s own business, so let us deal with it ourselves!”

As soon as she finished speaking, she shot up into the sky.

The pig riding young woman went over to Yang Ye’s side and patted him on the shoulder, “Do you understand? They mean that you’re too weak. Sigh, it can’t be helped. You really are so weak.”

As soon as she finished speaking, she shot up into the sky.

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

Nether Maiden walked over to Yang Ye and said, “Take care!”

As soon as she finished speaking, she vanished on the spot.

It didn’t take long for all of them to vanish on the spot.

Yang Ye gazed at An Nanjing. He was about to speak but she spoke before him, “If you go, then I will; if you don’t, then I won’t!”

Yang Ye fell silent for a short while, and then he nodded, “Then let’s go together.”

“It’s best if you don’t!” Suddenly, Little Sky said, “That woman is very strong. She really isn’t someone both of you can deal with. Even that second sister of yours is no match for her. As for you, you have no chance.”

Yang Ye said, “If I really didn’t have the strength to do so, then I would definitely not. Because I would just be a burden to them. However, Little Sky, if I go all out, I think I’m not that weak. At the very least, I’ll be able to help them.” When he spoke up to this point, he looked up at the sky, “Their eldest sister hasn’t shown herself, but they are here in the large world. Why? Because of me. She used me to force them to come here. They didn’t have to come, but they still did. Since they didn’t abandon me, how can I abandon them?”

Little Sky fell silent for a long time, “I’m sorry. I can’t help you fight.”

“I understand!” Yang Ye walked over to her, “You have your own principles that you hold on to. I understand that. Even though you can’t help me fight, it doesn’t represent that we’re not good friends. Moreover, even though you’ve never helped me in battle, you’ve helped me in many other aspects.”

He wasn’t lying. Since he knew Little Sky, she’d really helped him a lot.

But besides allowing her to stay in the Primordial Pagoda, he hadn’t helped her with anything. Strictly speaking, Little Sky didn’t owe him anything, and he owed her a lot instead.

Meanwhile, An Nanjing spoke abruptly, “Let’s go!”

Yang Ye nodded, and then he was about to say something to Zi’er, but the latter shook her head, “I’m going with you.”

Yang Ye replied, “Get into the Primordial Pagoda with Little Sky!”

Zi’er nodded, and then she transformed into a ray of violet light that entered Yang Ye’s body.

Yang Ye gazed at Little Sky. The latter hesitated for a moment before she flipped her palm, and then she passed a rock to Yang Ye, “Heaven’s Eye Rock. It’s formed after an Eye of the Heaven Dao comes to the end of its life. It only has a single use, and it’s able to protect its owner from a single lethal attack. It’s much greater than the casket lid. However, it can only be used once. Use it wisely.”

As soon as she finished speaking, she entered the Primordial Pagoda as well.

Yang Ye gazed at An Nanjing, “Let’s go!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he shot up into the sky with her. Once they arrived in the sky, the ground below started to tremble violently. Yang Ye and An Nanjing looked down, and their expressions instantly changed when they witnessed the scene below them.

When looked at from high above, Coiling Dragon Mountain was like a huge dragon coiled up there. At this moment, the huge dragon was trembling violently. It didn’t take long for the mountain range to collapse, and then a huge golden dragon shot up into the air.

Roar!

A dragon roar resounded through the sky. All the living beings throughout the continent were shocked at this moment.

The huge golden dragon paid no attention to Yang Ye and An Nanjing, and it just shot up into the air and vanished into outer space.

Yang Ye had an extremely solemn expression on his face. Obviously, that dragon was definitely on Fan Yinyu’s side.

Yang Ye fell silent for an instant and said, “Let’s just try our best!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye transformed into a ray of light that shot up into the sky.
