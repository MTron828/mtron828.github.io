Chapter 2319 – Two Sabers and One Sword!

Needless to say, it was an extremely painful process.

In the beginning, Yang Ye would fall to the ground after going just a short distance, but he always crawled back up and continued until he couldn’t. Bai Zhixian’s heart was always in pain as she watched this.

Now, she finally knew how Yang Ye had obtained his current strength!

It had been obtained by giving his cultivation everything he had!

Butcher and the others were really pleased by Yang Ye’s display, and it was especially so for Butcher. As Yang Ye’s master, he was happier than anyone to have a disciple who could endure suffering. Moreover, this wasn’t just any ordinary suffering. In the beginning, Yang Ye’s body cracked apart as he walked, but he didn’t make a sound and just continued!

Such will power was truly too rare!

Of course, this method of training was extremely harmful to Yang Ye’s body. So, Butcher and Wang Erya’s grandfather would go deep into the rear mountains in search of herbs every single day, and then they would give them to Yang Ye to immerse his body in!

It could be said that Yang Ye’s body wouldn’t have been able to endure his training without the herbs they found for him. Of course, he would have been able to endure even double this training if he had the Primordial Pagoda with him.

Unfortunately, the little bit of Primordial Violet Energy he had in his body was far insufficient to repair his body. When he had the Primordial Pagoda, it could absorb spirit energy on its own and convert the spirit energy into Primordial Violet Energy for him. So, he didn’t have to worry about Primordial Violet Energy at all. Yet now, he had to worry about it. Once his body was injured too much, and he didn’t have sufficient Primordial Violet Energy, he would be in big trouble!

So, the herbs they provided him were extremely important. The herbs Wang Erya’s grandfather found improved his body’s strength, and Butcher’s improved his arms. Just like that, day after day passed by, and Yang Ye’s body and arms improved incessantly. As for his body, it grew more and more accustomed to the huge saber. At the very least, he could walk normally now.

One day, Yang Ye arrived at the rear mountains again. However, he stopped and went to an empty place.

He twisted his right hand slightly, and a black sword appeared there. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

The sword!

Yang Ye’s body suddenly turned ethereal, and then he swung his sword forward.

The Sword Domain!

Hiss!

Space before him was sliced open, but that wasn’t the end of it. At the instant his sword descended, another swing had been executed at practically the same instant. However, Yang Ye was blasted away when this swing had only descended halfway.

Yang Ye was blasted over 3km away.

Bam!

A deep hole was slammed open in the ground.

But it didn’t take long for Yang Ye to crawl back up, and then he started walking toward the distance with Invincible on his back.

Just like that, a month passed. Every day, Yang Ye would come here and train with the sword, but only once! Because just that once would exhaust him.

In a bamboo house.

Yang Ye laid on the bed with his body completely bare.

Bai Zhixian was in front of him, and she was applying the liquid within a white jade bottle on him. In the beginning, it was quite embarrassing for her, but after days went by, she’d gotten used to Yang Ye’s body. In any case, she’d seen everything and touched everything, so there was no need for embarrassment.

However, there would be something unspeakable and embarrassing that occurred every single time!

This time was no exception!

This was naturally not something to divulge to others.

Two hours later, Yang Ye got up from the bed, and Bai Zhixian immediately helped him put on some clothes and walked to the village’s entrance with him and watched him go into the boundless rear mountains. In the beginning, she had been quite worried and went with him to the rear mountains. However, Yang Ye seemed to be growing more and more normal. Of course, the main reason was that Auntie Vege had suppressed some of his madness intent. Otherwise, he would still not be normal at all!

Presently, he wouldn’t attack everyone he saw, but he still wasn’t someone that could be offended!

He would go mad if he was!

Cultivate and temper the body!

Yang Ye did only these two things every day from then on.

One day, he went to the rear mountains and suddenly went deep into that forest there. Yang Ye found the Skywalker Wolf there.

The wolf was naturally furious to see its sword enemy from before.

It howled madly at Yang Ye because this human before him had brought utter humiliation to it!

The wolf pounced and charged at Yang Ye.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly put down the saber on his back, and then a black sword appeared in his grasp.

An instant later, the wolf was in front of him, and the powerful force it carried caused the space around Yang Ye to crack open.

At the same time, Yang Ye’s body suddenly turned ethereal, and then he swung his sword down. At practically the same instant that it descended, Yang Ye had executed another swing of his sword!

The Sword Domain!

Two swings of the sword!

Boom!

As soon as they descended, the wolf was blasted far away. In the end, it slammed open a deep hole in the ground, and it took quite some time for it to crawl out of it.

The wolf’s entire body had cracked open!

The Skywalker Wolf’s entire body had cracked open. Especially the injury on its head, if that injury had gone just a little deeper, its head would have cracked open.

The wolf gazed at Yang Ye, and the ferocity in its eyes had waned and was replaced with vigilance and fear instead!

Yang Ye didn’t launch another attack, he just put the huge sword back on his back and left.

The wolf seemed to visibly relax upon seeing Yang Ye leave, and then it vanished into the boundless rear mountains.

Not long after Yang Ye left, a middle aged man appeared here.

It was Butcher.

He was naturally worried about Yang Ye being alone in the rear mountains. While Nine Hells Emperor was heavily injured, he wasn’t dead. Moreover, there were many other powerful demons in the rear mountains, and they weren’t existences that Yang Ye could fight against. So, he always followed Yang Ye into the rear mountains.

As he recalled Yang Ye’s attack just now, Butcher fell silent for a long time and laughed bitterly, “His sword is still a little stronger!”

He turned around and left once he finished speaking.

The Sword!

Yang Ye’s bodily strength and the strength in his arms had multiplied by countless times since he arrived at Eternal Village, and his attainments in the saber could be said to have advanced by leaps and bounds. It wasn’t an exaggeration to say that ordinary True Dao Realm experts were nothing before him! However, they had gradually overlooked Yang Ye’s attainments in the sword.

Yang Ye had already been able to kill True Dao Realm experts with the sword!

As his physical strength and arm strength grew, his sword was improving too. Just like the scene from before. In the past, Yang Ye hadn’t been able to instantly swing with the Sword Domain twice! Yet now, he could accomplish that!

Moreover, while he trained with the saber, his speed, reaction, and speed had been improved tremendously. At the same time, the speed and strength of his sword were improving tremendously.

In the end, as far as Butcher was concerned, the saber and the sword were probably the same to Yang Ye. In any case, they were all used to kill!

Kill!

Both the saber and the sword were used to kill, and both of them were just tools in his hands. That was why Yang Ye could use both of them with such ease.

As far as he was concerned, the saber was the sword, and the sword could be the saber.

…

At the entrance of Eternal Village, Butcher brought Yang Ye and Bai Zhixian here, and then he stretched out his hand. A machete appeared in his grasp, and he pointed it at Yang Ye, “Bring it!”

Yang Ye didn’t react!

Meanwhile, Butcher suddenly appeared in front of Yang Ye and swung his saber!

Bai Zhixian immediately moved aside.

Yang Ye suddenly looked up. He didn’t dodge and just stretched both hands behind himself to grab Invincible, and then he swung it!

A head-on collision!

Boom!

Yang Ye was blasted into the village, and a long trench had been dug open in front of him!

Butcher took a step forward, “Come on! Continue!”

Yang Ye stomped his right foot down.

Boom!

The ground shook violently while Yang Ye instantly arrived above Butcher, and then he swung his saber!

Pure strength!

It was a swing without any technique or flashy moves!

Butcher’s eyes narrowed slightly and took half a step back with his right foot. A moment later, he grabbed his machete with both hands and swung it up!

Boom!

As soon as their sabers collided, Butcher was pushed around 30m back while Yang Ye was blasted away.

Yang Ye slammed into the ground again.

A short while later, Yang Ye crawled up slowly from there. At this moment, some cracks had appeared on his arms!

While his strength had improved tremendously, he wasn’t capable of fully using Invincible, and his strength wasn’t sufficient!

Suddenly, Butcher dashed toward Yang Ye.

Sparks flew as his machete was being dragged against the ground!

It only took a moment for Butcher to appear in front of Yang Ye, and then he slammed his machete at Yang Ye. It seemed like he could chop open the ground, and it was a simply suffocating aura!

Yang Ye still didn’t choose to dodge!

He raised his saber and swung it!

Their sabers collided once more.

Boom!

A wave of powerful force rippled out from the point of collision. Butcher was pushed back while Yang Ye was blasted away. Moreover, bloody cracks had appeared all over Yang Ye’s arms.

Both of his arms had cracked open!

Meanwhile, Butcher charged at Yang Ye again.

Suddenly, Yang Ye grabbed Invincible and hurled it at Butcher.

The saber tore through the air and tore open everything before it!

Butcher’s eyes narrowed slightly, and he swiftly flicked his saber and blasted Invincible over 1km to the right. However, right at this moment, his expression changed slightly, and he retreated 3m back,

There was a bloody injury on his stomach!

Hidden Blade!

He looked up and a ray of sword energy descended straight at him.

If one looked carefully, one would notice that there were two rays of sword energy there!

The Sword Domain!

The sword energy descended!

Butcher’s eyes narrowed slightly, and he raised his machete before him.

Clang!

A clear clang resounded, and then Butcher’s machete broke into two while Butcher himself was blasted over 30m away. Meanwhile, a huge saber tore through the air toward him.

It was Invincible!

Butcher’s expression remained unchanged, and he pressed his palms together. He instantly clamped down on Invincible!

However, his expression changed drastically at the exact same instant.

A ray of cold light flashed by his stomach again.

Hiss!

A string of blood sprayed, and Butcher moved 10m back again!

Butcher glanced at his stomach, and then he looked up. At this moment, a pitch black sword was in Yang Ye’s right grasp, and Hidden Blade was in his left!

As for Yang Ye’s back, Invincible was there!

Two sabers and one sword!
