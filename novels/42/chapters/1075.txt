Chapter 1076 – One Or A Hundred Makes No Difference!

Who does he think he is!

The corners of the old man and beautiful woman’s eyes twitched when they heard Yang Ye. After all, Mo Yuntian was an expert on the Martial Rankings!

What was being on the Martial Rankings like?

There were billions in the Central Divine Prefecture, but only 50 could ascend the Martial Rankings. It could be said that only extraordinary geniuses amongst geniuses could be ranked on the Martial Rankings.

Such geniuses would definitely become an extraordinary expert in the future!

The facts proved that it really was the case. Because many of the top-rate experts in the Central Divine Prefecture were once ranked on the Martial Rankings.

Moreover, while there were many Diamond Rank powers in the Central Divine Prefecture, very few amongst them possessed disciples who were able to be ranked on the rankings. Just like White Deer Academy. It was called the number one academy of the Central Divine Prefecture, but merely 3 of its geniuses were able to ascend the Martial Rankings. That clearly showed how terrifying it was!

At this moment, Yang Ye had actually insulted Mo Yuntian who’d ascended the rankings, so the beautiful woman and the others really wanted to know what Yang Ye thought of Mo Yuntian!

Tan Feng and the others instantly revealed gloomy expressions when they heard Yang Ye, and a short while passed before Tan Feng said, “You....”

He was about to speak but Yang Ye had already vanished on the spot. At this moment, Tan Feng’s expression changed violently, and he swiftly waved his dagger forward. A ray of cold light flashed, but it vanished just a moment later, and then a fist arrived before him.

Crack!

The powerful force within the fist instantly caused the space around Tan Feng to crack apart!

A wisp of astonishment flashed through his eyes. He’d never imagined that Yang Ye’s strength was actually at such a level. He didn’t dare act carelessly at all, and the profound energy within him surged into the dagger before he swung it swiftly!

Clang!

Bang!

The dagger broke, and then blood sprayed from Tan Feng’s mouth while his figure was blasted flying.

He’d been defeated with a single punch!

The grey robed old man and the beautiful woman were stunned.

Even though Tan Feng was a high rank Half-Saint, his strength was absolutely sufficient to crush Saints. After all, the geniuses fostered by a Diamond Rank power like White Crane Academy couldn’t be judged based on convention. All of them possessed the best resources and the best techniques, and they had countless formidable teachers!

They received the best!

However, it was such a genius that had been defeated with just a single punch!

The others who’d come here with Tan Feng were stunned. They’d never imagined that Tan Feng would have actually been defeated just like that! After all, Tan Feng was ranked in the top 20 of the Law Faction!

Who is he?

Tan Feng was slightly stunned. Indeed, he was stunned by Yang Ye’s blow. He was very confident in his own ability, and unless he encountered one of those Saints who had never relied on external forces to attain the Saint Realm, he didn’t take ordinary Saints seriously at all. However, he’d actually been defeated by a single punch from a Half-Saint!

Yang Ye was about to launch another attack when the beautiful woman suddenly spoke, “Young Master Ye, can you give me some face?”

Yang Ye stopped and looked at her. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

She said, “They are students from White Deer Academy, and they are inner court students at the very least. My merchant group will probably face some trouble if they die here.”

Yang Ye shrugged. He was about to say something when the old man by the beautiful woman’s side suddenly cried out involuntarily, “Young Master Ye! Watch out!”

Tan Feng appeared behind Yang Ye at the same instant that the old man had finished speaking, and a dagger pressed against Yang Ye’s neck. At the same time, Tan Feng’s ferocious voice resounded from behind Yang Ye, “You fucking....”

However, he hadn’t even finished speaking when his figure was blasted flying.

Everyone here was stunned!

It was especially so for the old man. His eyes were filled with astonishment because only he had seen what happened clearly. It was exactly because he’d seen it that he was extremely shocked. Yang Ye and Tan Feng had attacked at the exact same time that Tan Feng spoke. However, Yang Ye was completely unharmed when Tan Feng’s dagger swiped at his throat!

Is he even human?

Yang Ye turned around to gaze at Tan Feng, and the latter was spitting out blood incessantly. His stomach had sunken down completely, and the force of Yang Ye’s fist had caused all his internal organs to crack apart!

Yang Ye’s figure flashed towards Tan Feng. Meanwhile, the other 2 from White Deer Academy suddenly obstructed Yang Ye’s path. Brother Lin said, “We were rash and reckless in this matter, I hope that....”

“Perhaps nothing would have happened if you said that earlier. But now? Hahaha....” The 2 of them were instantly blasted flying once Yang Ye finished speaking, and their figures exploded into countless bits in midair!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye had arrived in front of Tan Feng, and then he stomped his foot down towards Tan Feng’s head.

The Law Faction!

In Yang Ye’s opinion, the Law Faction was his enemy. Because he was very clearly aware that the Law Faction would definitely annihilate Ocean of Clouds Academy and City if he died! Moreover, he was sure that the Law Faction would definitely not show him any mercy during the competition in White Deer Academy. Since it was like that, why should he show any mercy?

One or a hundred deaths didn’t make a difference to him. In any case, he would be killing them, so why not kill all of them?

Bang!

Yang Ye’s foot didn’t hit its target because Tan Feng had vanished on the spot, and the space beneath his foot instantly collapsed. Yang Ye looked up into the sky, and he saw a huge palm tear through space and claw at him.

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly. He suddenly stomped his right foot against the ground, and he shot into the sky like a cannonball and collided with the huge palm.

Bang!

A huge explosion resounded as the palm exploded into pieces.

Yang Ye descended to the ground. At this moment, an old man in luxurious robes had appeared around 30m away from him. The old man glanced at Yang Ye, and then tossed Tan Feng on the ground before he said, “As a student of the Law Faction, you actually sought help from the academy, and your enemy is merely a Half-Saint. What an accomplishment!”

Tan Feng was livid, but he didn’t dare to talk back!

The old man paid no further attention to Tan Feng, and he gazed at Yang Ye instead, “You actually dared to kill members of my White Deer Academy, you’re quite brave indeed. I hope your strength is on par with your courage!”

He was about to attack at this point, but the beautiful woman suddenly said, “Senior, this matter....”

“You can just shut your mouth!” The old man interrupted her and spoke coldly, “I don’t want to listen to your nonsense. All I know is that he killed students of my White Deer Academy, and they even were students of my Law Faction. As for the 2 of you, I’ll spare your lives out of consideration for Cloud Merchant Group. But don’t let me see any of you in Sky Capital City again, otherwise I won’t give face to anyone!”

The woman and old man’s faces fell. Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly chuckled, “While I was still in Pine Prefecture, I heard how arrogant your Law Faction is. Now that I’ve witnessed it for myself, it really is true.”

“Pine Prefecture?” The old man sized up Yang Ye for a long time, and then he spoke in a low voice, “Your body is comparable to a Saint, and you’re from Pine Prefecture.... You’re Yang Ye!”

Tan Feng was stunned when he heard this, and he gazed at Yang Ye with disbelief!

Yang Ye was slightly stunned as well, and then he said, “How did you know?”

“It really is you!” The old man continued, “I never expected that you would already be in the Central Divine Prefecture. You’re quite brave, and you have a little strength as well. No wonder you dared to boast like that. However, you’ll realize how laughable and ignorant you are. I won’t kill you today. I’ll see you in my academy in 2 days!” As soon as he finished speaking, the old man’s figure flashed as he intended to leave.

Suddenly, a ray of light flashed, and then Tan Feng’s head suddenly flew up into the air while he followed the old man.

The old man stopped moving, and his face was gloomy.

Yang Ye smiled, “Go back and tell those so-called geniuses of your Law Faction to wait for me!”

“If it wasn’t for certain reasons, I would have killed you already!” The old man gazed gloomily at Yang Ye, “But it’s fine, I can let you live 2 more days!”

The old man vanished on the spot once he finished speaking.

The beautiful woman spoke softly, “Are you confident?”

Yang Ye naturally knew what she was talking about, and he immediately shook his head.

Both the woman and the grey robed old man were stunned, and she said, “You... you aren’t confident?”

Yang Ye replied, “I’ve met one of the members of the Law Faction, and his strength was really not bad. Moreover, he was only ranked at the 15th position within the Law Faction. So, I can imagine how strong the other students ranked higher than him are.”

She spoke solemnly, “To be honest, if this is the extent of your strength, then it’s far from sufficient!”

Yang Ye grinned and didn’t say anything. He really wasn’t confident in winning the competition. After all, White Deer Academy couldn’t be compared to Ocean of Clouds Academy. There definitely were many geniuses amongst them who surpassed Lou Qianxiao or were much more terrifying than him. However, Yang Ye had no other choice. Not to mention geniuses on par with Lou Qianxiao, he would still head to White Deer Academy to participate in the competition even if he had to face an Emperor!

Because if he didn’t, then the battlefield would be moved to Ocean of Clouds City, but if he came here, then the battlefield would be in White Deer Academy.

Ocean of Clouds Academy and City really couldn’t endure anymore battles!

The beautiful woman suddenly said, “Right, I gained some information about that other woman you asked me search for, Ding Shaoyao!”

“Hmm?” Yang Ye gazed at her, “Do you have her whereabouts?”

She shook her head, “I only know that she once appeared in Arrival City!”

“Arrival City?” Yang Ye frowned, “That city which every single person from the lower dimensions would arrive at?”

She nodded in response, “Your friend is from the lower dimensions?”

Yang Ye nodded.

She glanced at Yang Ye, remained silent for a long time, and then said, “Xiao Yuxi might be from the lower dimensions as well!”

Yang Ye replied, “She always was!”

The beautiful woman blurted out, “You’re from there as well?”

Yang Ye glanced at her and nodded.

“So that’s why!” She nodded, “I understand now!”

“Hahaha!” Suddenly, numerous sounds of laughter resounded in the sky, “Where’s Yang Ye? Where’s that fellow Yang Ye who said that he would crush our Law Faction? Come on! Quickly come out here and let us meet you....”

As soon as that voice finished resounded, over a dozen rays of light shot down from the sky!

Rumble!

The entire branch of Cloud Merchant Group was instantly obliterated!

At the same time, countless shrill cries resounded throughout the area.
