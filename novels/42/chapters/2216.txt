Chapter 2217 – Come at Me!

The surroundings were silent!

The humans and experts from the sky race and Dao Path had entered the city, and only the cultivators of the other races remained outside the city.

Sorrow filled their eyes as they gazed at the Shaman Emperor’s corpse, and there was despair on their faces too.

Void Spirit City.

Yang Ye entered Void Spirit Hall, and Yang Lianshuang was hesitant to speak behind him.

Yang Ye stopped, gazed at her, and asked, “You think they’re pitiable?”

She remained silent.

Yang Ye said, “Lianshuang, we’re not here to do charity work. You must understand that we can’t even protect ourselves right now! How will we fight the undying race when they attack? Moreover, everyone pities the weak, and they are weak now, so you pity them. But have you thought about how they treated the human race when the human race was in trouble? They didn’t think that the human race was pitiable, they plundered the human race instead. They may be pitiable now because they are weak, but think about how they’ll act when they are stronger than us!”

Yang Ye shook his head, “Moreover, they merely hope to treat this place as a shelter. It isn’t just them, even many from the sky race and Dao Path think the same way. As far as they are concerned, even if the sky falls down, they’ll have me and all of you to save them. To put it simply, most of them are just using us. When the undying race comes, how many will be willing to face them with us?”

Yang Lianshuang spoke softly, “Then why did you allow the sky race and Dao Path to stay?”

Yang Ye gazed at Yang Lianshuang, “You know Xiao Qi, right? If she didn’t sacrifice herself in the lower universe, I would be dead. It was she who paid the price of falling into deep sleep in order to save me. How can I not repay that kindness? While the Dao Progenitor never saved me, he helped me on many occasions. I never forget those who harm me, and I never forget those who help me.”

He frowned slightly at this point and looked up, “They’re here!”

They are here!

Yang Lianshuang looked up.

In the sky above Void Spirit Continent.

100 undying cavalries descended soundlessly!

Every single one of them had a Nefarious below them!

At this moment, countless people throughout the continent looked up at the sky. There was an old man before the army of undying cavalry, and this old man was the Weapon Progenitor!

A progenitor!

Beside the Weapon Progenitor was an undying cavalry in a cape. It was the Third Commander of the army of undying cavalry who was just inferior in status to Dugu Juetian, the Exalted Lord of the army!

The Weapon Progenitor glanced at the Third Commander and said, “Just 100 are probably not enough!”

The Third Commander glanced at him, “Are you lacking in confidence toward yourself or us?”

The Weapon Progenitor shook his head slightly, “Yang Ye is not ordinary.”

“Not ordinary?” The Third Commander suddenly chuckled, “Do you know how many universes my undying race has conquered? During this period, do you know how many extraordinary geniuses we’ve encountered? Or how many extraordinary experts we’ve encountered?”

He looked down at the continent below and continued, “My undying race has seen too many monstrous geniuses. Not to mention geniuses like him, we’ve even seen greater ones. But do you know what happened to them in the end? They died, all of them died. They didn’t even have the right to enter the Tomb of Gods!”

The Weapon Progenitor glanced at the Third Commander and remained silent.

Confidence!

He’d noticed something while being with the undying race, they were extremely confident. Of course, they had the strength to back it up, but he was still quite worried. Yang Ye was not someone who was that easy to deal with!

Meanwhile, a ray of blood red light shot up from below, and then Yang Ye appeared nearby.

Elder Yuan was by his side.

Elder Yuan glanced at the undying cavalry, and then he gazed at the Weapon Progenitor, grinned, and didn’t say a word. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

The Third Commander sized up Yang Ye and said, “Yang Ye, do you think your side has a chance?”

Yang Ye replied indifferently, “What do you think?”

Third Commander grinned, “I’ll be frank with you. If you’re willing to lead the others at the Major Zen Realm or above to surrender to us, then we will spare your lives. As for you, the Exalted Lord has promised to personally recommend you to Lord Xiao Lou if you’re willing to serve our undying race, so that Lord Xiao Lou will foster you himself.”

“Yang Ye!” Meanwhile, the Weapon Progenitor suddenly said, “This is an opportunity.”

Yang Ye gazed at the Weapon Progenitor, and the latter added, “You can’t stop the undying race. Even if all the races and the four Paths were at their prime, we still wouldn’t be able to stop them, let alone now. So, surrender!”

“Surrender?” Yang Ye smiled, “Just like all of you progenitors? And become their dogs?”

The Weapon Progenitor’s expression instantly turned unsightly. Meanwhile, Yang Ye continued, “Actually, I never expected a dignified progenitor to actually be willing to be someone’s dog. Weapon Progenitor, I’m quite curious, is it nice to be a dog?”

The Weapon Progenitor replied indifferently, “Yang Ye, I hope you’ll still be able to speak those words in a while.”

Yang Ye smiled and gazed at the Third Commander, “Come, let me see how strong the undying race is!”

“You?” A wisp of ridicule curled up on the Third Commander’s mouth, “Are you even qualified?”

Bang!

Suddenly, over a dozen auras surged up from below, and the Sky Maiden and the others appeared by Yang Ye’s side.

Sky Maiden and the others hadn’t left Void Spirit Continent. After the battle that day, they had started training like they’d gone mad, and with the special cultivation grounds on Void Spirit Continent, their cultivations had risen by leaps and bounds!

While they hadn’t attained the Progenitor Realm, they weren’t the same as they had been during the previous battle!

Third Commander glanced at them and smiled, “Not bad, you’re much stronger than ordinary Sages. But it won’t change a thing.”

Hiss!

Suddenly, a ray of white light flashed.

Bang!

Third Commander was blasted 3km away!

A halberd floated where she’d been a moment ago!

Elysium!

Everyone gazed at Yang Ye’s right, a woman in a white dress had appeared there.

An Nanjing!

An Nanjing looked straight at Third Commander, “Is the undying race very strong?”

Third Commander had a ferocious smile on her face, “You’ll find out soon!”

Suddenly, An Nanjing vanished on the spot, and she was in front of him when she appeared again. She took Elysium in one hand and slammed it down.

Third Commander’s reaction was extremely fast too, and she immediately stabbed her spear forward.

Bang!

An explosion resounded, and then Third Commander was pushed back repeatedly!

An Nanjing didn’t follow up with another attack, and she just put Elysium down gently.

Bang!

The space in a huge area trembled violently.

Meanwhile, An Nanjing gazed at him, “I think you’re very weak.”

“Is that so?” Third Commander wiped off the blood on the corner of her mouth and smiled fiercely, “Needless to say, I underestimated you a little.”

She stomped her foot down once she finished speaking, and she transformed into a ray of dark light that charged at An Nanjing.

At this moment, she was like a shooting star, and her powerful aura caused space to tremble around him.

Suddenly, An Nanjing hurled Elysium forward.

Hiss!

It tore through space!

Bang!

Third Commander was blasted away once more, and she flew extremely far away!

At this moment, everyone here was shocked, including Yang Ye!

An Nanjing’s strength was much stronger than it had been.

As if she knew how shocked Yang Ye was, she glanced at him and said, “I gained a lot from that battle!”

Yang Ye immediately came to an understanding when he heard this.

While An Nanjing had almost died during that battle, she hadn’t. Since she hadn’t, she’d gained a lot from the battle. Hopeless situations are the best to help someone go beyond their limits!

Obviously, An Nanjing had succeeded and grown even stronger!

Actually, An Nanjing wasn’t the only one. Yang Ye, Sky Maiden, and all the others had gained tremendously from the battle!

Third Commander was extremely furious right now. As far as she was concerned, it was a huge humiliation to suffer such a loss against someone in the same realm of cultivation!

Meanwhile, Third Commander whistled, and then a demon beast appeared below her.

A Nefarious!

Third Commander sat on the Nefarious, and then she transformed into a ray of dark light that appeared in front of An Nanjing. At the same time, a spear stabbed at An Nanjing’s forehead!

Right when it was just half an inch away from her forehead, it stopped abruptly.

It was because An Nanjing had grabbed the tip of the spear!

Third Commander’s pupils constricted slightly from the sight of this. Meanwhile, An Nanjing pulled while slamming her knee against the Third Commander’s stomach.

Bang!

Third Commander was blasted away while her figure curled into an inverted ‘c’. But that wasn’t the end of it. At the same time, An Nanjing hurled the Third Commander’s spear which she was holding in her grasp!

Hiss!

The spear tore through space and instantly stabbed Third Commander. The powerful force it carried blasted Third Commander far away again!

Everyone here gazed at An Nanjing!

An Nanjing ignored them as she raised her right hand behind her head, and then she coiled her ponytail around her neck. After that, she gazed at the army of undying cavalry and pointed Elysium at them, “All of you come at me!”
