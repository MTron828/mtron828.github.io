Chapter 1792 – The Martial Envoy!

Everyone here looked towards the source of the voice.

The space there trembled slightly, and then it cracked open. An old man in a violet robe walked out from the spatial rift while pushing a woman who wore a veil.

She was seated in a wheelchair!

Yang Ye was stunned when he saw the old man.

He recognized the old man. It was the same violet robed old man in Sword Immortal City, and the woman was the mysterious woman there. Moreover, she was from the Nether Pavilion!

Everyone gazed at the mysterious woman.

It didn’t take long for the old man to push her until she arrived quite close to the woman in a red dress.

The mysterious woman gazed at Yang Ye and smiled, “Young Master Yang, long time no see!”

Yang Ye glanced at her and said, “I didn’t expect that you would come here and help.”

She grinned, and then she gazed at Nether Maiden’s group, “I’m surprised all of you were able to grow to this extent.”

Nether Maiden gazed at her, “Who are you?!”

The mysterious woman spoke softly, “Who I am isn’t important.”

Once she finished speaking, she gazed at the woman in a red dress, “Come, let’s spar a little. I haven’t fought in a long time.”

The woman in a red dress nodded slightly, “As you wish.”

A moment later, a blood red palm suddenly appeared above the mysterious woman. Meanwhile, a long black ruler suddenly appeared in the mysterious woman’s grasp. An instant later, it transformed into a black ray of light that shot up into the sky, and it instantly obliterated the blood red palm!

Yang Ye noticed that Nether Maiden and the others’ expressions changed when they saw the black ruler.

Their eyes were filled with disbelief!

Yang Ye gazed at Nether Maiden, “What is it?”

She slowly clenched her fists, “The Martial Ruler… I know who she is!”

Yang Ye asked, “Who?”

Nether Maiden spoke solemnly, “My Nether Pavilion has a Civil Envoy and Martial Envoy. You’ve met the Civil Envoy, it was Fan Yinyu who you met in Merak System. As for her, she should be the Martial Envoy who has vanished for a long time.”

The Nether Pavilion’s Martial Envoy!

Yang Ye asked, “Is the Martial Envoy that strong?”

Nether Maiden nodded slightly, “Even the Civil Envoy was that strong, as the Martial Envoy, how can she be weak? Moreover, she seems to have been in the Milky Way System’s medium universe for a long time. She’s a 6th stage True Realm expert now, and her strength is probably countless times stronger than how it was in the past!”

She paused for a moment and continued, “However, there seems to be conflict between her and our current pavilion master. Or to be more precise, as far as she’s concerned, besides Pavilion Master Shao Siyou, no one else can be the pavilion master!”

Yang Ye shook his head. The Nether Pavilion is in quite a complicated situation!

Of course, he was even more curious about their pavilion master, Shao Siyou. Because she’d actually been able to make so many experts follow her wholeheartedly, and that was extraordinary!

At this moment, Ying Yu and the others’ expressions were quite unsightly. Obviously, they hadn’t expected Yang Ye’s side to gain help from someone, and it was even someone so strong!

Meanwhile, the woman in a red dress sized up the Martial Envoy, and she said, “Interesting indeed.”

As soon as she finished speaking, she stretched out her right hand and twisted it lightly. In an instant, a wave of blood suddenly appeared before her, and then it transformed into a huge blood red dragon that was over 300m long.

She tapped it, and it suddenly emanated a sonorous dragon roar before slamming its body down at the Martial Envoy.

The Martial Envoy’s expression was calm as she sat on her wheelchair. When the dragon arrived above her, she suddenly moved her hand. The Martial Ruler in her grasp suddenly transformed into a ray of black light that shot up into the sky. When it arrived before the huge blood dragon, it suddenly shook violently, and then the expressions of all the spectators changed!

It was because the world in a huge area around the attack had suddenly started to turn ethereal!

Boom!

An instant later, a rumbling explosion resounded, and then everyone’s vision turned black as they fell into darkness.

The space in a huge area had collapsed!

Fortunately, they weren’t ordinary people, so it didn’t affect them much!

Around 15 minutes passed before space gradually returned to normal.

At this moment, the woman in a red dress and the Martial Envoy were still there.

They seemed to be completely fine!

A few moments of silence ensued, and then the Martial Envoy spoke abruptly, “I know that you haven’t used your full strength, and it shouldn’t be a problem for you to kill me if you do. However, you won’t. Because Heaven Pillar Mountain’s barrier will be in its weakened state in just a few months. At that time, you have even stronger things to face, right?”

The woman in a red dress gazed at the Martial Envoy for a long time, “I’ll let you live a while longer!”

She turned to glance at Yang Ye, “You’ll regret not handing it over. Because those who come after me won’t be so merciful to you!”

She vanished on the spot once she finished speaking.

Once the woman in a red dress vanished, the Martial Envoy gazed at Ying Yu’s group and said, “Do you still want to fight now?”

Nether Maiden and the others gazed at Ying Yu’s group as well, and their eyes were filled with vigilance.

Ying Yu fell silent for a few moments, and then he suddenly gazed at the Martial Envoy, “We won’t. Please go ahead and leave!”

The Martial Envoy glanced at Ying Yu, and then she chuckled, “As expected of the Ying Clan’s ancestor. You’re very smart.”

As soon as she finished speaking, she gazed at Yang Ye, “Young Master Yang, let’s go!”

Yang Ye said, “Thank you.” If she hadn’t come to help them, then they would be in a very terrible situation. After all, that woman in a red dress was too strong, and the Ying Clan’s coalition was at the side.

The Martial Envoy grinned, “Young Master Yang, there’s no need to thank me. I need your help in Heaven Pillar Mountain as well.”

Yang Ye nodded, “I won’t refuse.”

“Then allow me to thank you in advance!” She grinned, “Farwell.”

As soon as she finished speaking, the violet robed old man appeared behind her, and then they were about to leave. However, Nether Maiden suddenly went over to her and asked, “You want to search for Pavilion Master Siyou as well?”

The Martial Envoy glanced at Nether Maiden and replied, “Is she still the pavilion master right now?”

Nether Maiden nodded.

The Martial Envoy chuckled, “What right does she have to be the pavilion master?”

As soon as she finished speaking, she vanished into space with the old man.

After they left, Yang Ye, Yang Lianshuang, and the others left as well.

Only the Ying Clan’s coalition remained here.

Lu Yuntian suddenly gazed at Ying Yu, ‘Senior Ying, why did you let them leave?”

The others gazed at him as well, and they had questioning gazes in their eyes. Even though Yang Ye’s side had another 6th stage True Realm expert, they still had a crushing advantage. Because Yang Ye was injured and didn’t have much profound energy left, so he didn’t have much combat strength left.

Ying Yu glanced at them and said, “If we attack, we’ll have a good chance to kill Yang Ye. But have you all thought about how many we’ll lose even if we can kill him?”

All of them fell silent.

Even though Yang Ye only had 11 experts on his side, they'd experienced the strengths of those 11 experts earlier. Not one of those 11 people were ordinary experts. Every single one of them was extremely mysterious and formidable!

Meanwhile, Ying Yu added, “All of you have to understand that our clans aren’t the only existences in this medium universe. There’s the Ku Clan, Wu Clan, Secret Sect, and various other mysterious powers. If we fight Yang Ye to the death, he’ll definitely cripple us. Once that happens, it’s very likely that we’ll be wiped off the face of this medium universe!”

He paused for a moment and continued, “The Ku Clan, Wu Clan, Secret Sect, and those other mysterious powers aren’t weaklings!”

Meanwhile, Lu Yuntian shook his head, “But if we let him go just like that, we’ll suffer endless future troubles!”

The others nodded to display their agreement. Yang Ye’s strength and natural talent were too terrifying. If he was allowed to continue growing, they didn’t dare to imagine how strong he would become!

Ying Yu suddenly chuckled, “Why would he? He’s in big trouble right now, and he won’t have time to look for trouble with us anymore.”

Lu Yuntian asked, “What do you mean?”

Ying Yu replied, “All of you probably don’t know much about Heaven Pillar Mountain. It’s a very terrifying place! Yet now, the people there are targeting Yang Ye. Haha! So, we just have to wait and help them investigate Yang Ye’s whereabouts. As for Yang Ye, there’ll be people to kill him!”

As soon as he finished speaking, the smile on his face grew even brighter.

Lu Yuntian and the others didn’t know how terrifying the existences in Heaven Pillar Mountain were, but he did. It could be said that it was the most terrifying place in the medium universe. Because it was a place filled with truly old geezers. Besides them, there were all sorts of other cultivators and ancient cultivators.

Yet now, the existences there were targeting Yang Ye.

It was absolutely good news for the Ying Clan! Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Suddenly, the space not too far away from them suddenly trembled, and then it was torn open. A moment later, a man walked out from the spatial rift.

The man glanced at Ying Yu’s group and asked, “Who’s Yang Ye?”

Ying Yu asked, “Why are you looking for him?”

The man’s gaze descended onto Ying Yu, and then Ying Yu’s expression changed drastically.

Boom!

A moment later, an explosion resounded, and then the others watched with astonishment as Ying Yu’s figure was blasted over 3km away.

Meanwhile, the man gazed at Ying Yu and said, “I’m asking the questions, understand?”
