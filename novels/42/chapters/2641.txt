Chapter 2642 – Lead the Way Quietly!

Two peak Destiny Realm experts!

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly, and it made him become slightly vigilant.

There was no free food in this world!

He always remembered that.

The mysterious black clothed figure before Yang Ye smiled, “What? You don’t want them?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “Be frank.”

The black clothed figure stood up, “Two conditions. One, if we win the battle, we want some things from the End World. Don’t worry, you won’t care about it. Two, if we win, I hope you will be willing to lend a hand if we need the Sprite Progenitor’s help. Of course, it won’t be anything that brings harm to the Sprite Progenitor.”

Yang Ye asked, “That’s it?”

The black clothed figure replied, “That’s it.”

Yang Ye asked, “What if we fail?”

The black clothed figure smiled, “You’ll die, and we’ll escape.”

Yang Ye asked, “Do you know what kind of place we’re going to?”

The black clothed figure chuckled, “Isn’t it just the End World?”

Yang Ye gazed at the black clothed figure in silence.

The black clothed figure walked closer to Yang Ye and said, “I can reveal that we came from there in the past.”

Yang Ye spoke softly, “Interesting.”

The black clothed figure smiled, “Anyway, do you know about the situation there?”

Yang Ye said, “You should!”Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

The black clothed figure nodded, “Allow me to give you a detailed description of the End World. After that, you can decide if you want to go. Firstly, those experts you saw in the Origin World, like Mr. Jing, Cang Hua, Shui Wubian, and that middle spear-wielding man in a snow white robe. That spear-wielding man is one of the four fellows who were fighting Tian Xiu that day, and his name is Li Zhiyuan, and he’s from the same time as the Abyss Lord, Qi Bitian. As for the other three who were fighting her, one of them is called Xu Yao. The era he’s from is unknown, and his strength is at the peak of the Destiny Realm too. As for the other two, they are independent cultivators, Xu Yue and Qin Xiao.”

The black clothed figure took two steps forward, paused for a moment, and continued, “All four of them are peak Destiny Realm experts. Even though they fought her four on one, I must remind you that while Tian Xiu could accomplish that, it doesn’t represent that others can do the same.”

Yang Ye asked, “Are there more?”

The black clothed figure replied, “Of course, if you think that’s all the forces they have, then you’re absolutely mistaken. Those people in the Origin World don’t belong to the End World. But now that the Origin World has been destroyed, those experts in the Origin World like Shui Wubian, the Divine Abode’s master, the master of Sky Palace, and the ancestors of some other powers have mostly moved to the End World. Besides that, while some other experts aren’t in the End World, they have links and ties to the End World. For example, the Dark Lord of Darkspace, the Void Lord of the Void World, the Eternal Lord of Eternal Kingdom… It’s because that place will become their home in the future.”

The black clothed figure chuckled at this point and continued, “To be frank, if the Abyss Lord and that woman, Tian Xiu, weren’t a little too strong, it would truly be impossible for you to destroy the Origin World that day. Because they were beyond strong, many experts didn’t dare to show themselves or join the battle! But now, if I’m not wrong, they aren’t by your side, are they?”

Yang Ye nodded, “Do you have information on them?”

The black clothed figure chuckled, “You think too highly of us! How could we dare to approach a battle of that level? However, according to the information we received, they aren’t in a very good situation.”

Yang Ye clenched his fists slowly, “What do you mean?”

The black clothed man replied solemnly, “I don’t know the specifics, but I’m sure of one thing, if they were in a good situation, then the experts of the End World would absolutely not dare to act against you. They have definitely obtained news that made them dare to openly act against you. Because they have nothing to worry about.”

Yang Ye was quite puzzled, “Why don’t they come straight for me?”

The black clothed figure smiled, “It’s naturally because they fear Destiny. You’re not someone they can just crush. If they get into a fight with you, and you make that Sprite Progenitor of yours summon the sprites of the universe again. Causing such a commotion is very likely to be noticed by Destiny. At that time, all of them would be finished. However, if you go to the End World, then no matter what they do, Destiny wouldn’t notice anything. At the very least, Destiny wouldn’t notice anything while that place hasn’t shattered completely.”

He walked forward and stopped right before Yang Ye, and then he continued, “Back to our previous topic. The End World is far stronger than you’ve ever imagined, and it’s even to the extent that there are some experts there which even we aren’t aware of. For example, that existence that made even the Desolate Emperor and Qi Bitian apprehensive in the Origin World. Even now, I still have no information about that existence who was hiding in space. So, do you still plan to go?”

Yang Ye nodded, “Of course.”

The black clothed figure nodded, “Then go. We’ll lend you a hand at the right time.”

Yang Ye glanced at the figure and left.

Once Yang Ye left, the black clothed figure sat down slowly and remained silent for a long time.

A long time later, the space before the figure trembled, and then a moment of silence ensued before the black clothed figure spoke softly, “Then we’ll take this gamble.”

Yang Ye left the War Dimension, and he looked up at the sky outside it.

Meanwhile, Snowy appeared on his shoulder. She wrapped her paws around Yang Ye’s neck and rubbed her head against his face.

Yang Ye rubbed her little head and grinned, “We’ll all be fine. Don’t worry.”

Snowy nodded slightly and entered the Primordial Pagoda.

Once Snowy entered the Primordial Pagoda, Yang Ye’s figure transformed into a ray of light that vanished into the distance.

In the Primordial Pagoda.

Snowy pranced over to where Qi Bitian used to live. Only Erya was there now.

Erya sat cross-legged there while strands of terrifying aura ceaselessly seeped out of her.

At this moment, Erya was terrifying. Even the dragon and the other demons didn’t dare to go close to her. Erya’s evil aura was something beyond the limits of their endurance!

Snowy went over to Erya and opened her mouth. A moment later, countless strands of World Energy and pure spirit energy surged out from her while Erya madly absorbed all of it.

Such a scene was probably unimaginable to absolutely everyone.

One was pure and kind, the other evil and vicious. They should be natural enemies, but at this moment, they were helping each other. Moreover, they were so close that they could eat the same tanghulu.

Snowy’s objective was very simple, and it was to help Erya grow quickly.

She was much more sensible now. She knew that Yang Ye may have to go to battle. But she wasn’t very good at fighting. However, Erya was amazing at fighting, so she’d come here to help Erya.

Suddenly, Erya opened her eyes, and her eyes were scarlet red.

Snowy wasn’t afraid at all. She just blinked and gazed at Erya.

Erya gazed at Snowy. In the beginning, there was only coldness and indifference in her eyes, but it didn’t take long for that to mellow down and become gentle.

Erya spoke softly, “Snowy, I want more.”

Snowy hurriedly nodded and continued sending her more spirit energy…

Erya glanced at her claws, and then she gazed at Snowy, “Snowy, I think I’ve recalled some things.”

Snowy gazed at her curiously, and she continued, “I-I think I was very formidable in the past. Right, once I head outside, I’m going to crush all those who bullied you. None of them will survive! I’m going to eat them alive.”

She licked her lips while greed and viciousness filled her eyes.

Snowy clenched her little fists while anger could be seen in her eyes. Because too, too many had been bullying them!

Outside the Primordial Pagoda.

After he left Eternal Kingdom, Yang Ye used the Myriad World Diagram to arrive at the End Dimension. The End Dimension wasn’t the End World, but it was the only way to get there. Actually, the Myriad World Diagram had the End World on it too. But he couldn’t teleport in there at all.

It prohibited all teleportation!

Unless his strength was at Qi Bitian’s level and he could go there by force!

Once he arrived at the End Dimension, Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings and walked slowly toward the distance.

The entire End Dimension was very desolate, and he didn’t sense any life here.

But it didn’t take long for Yang Ye to sense a strand of divine sense descend upon him.

Yang Ye stopped and looked up. An ethereal figure was floating in the air.

The figure spoke indifferently, “I’m here to welcome you, Sect Master Ye. You don’t mind that I’m all alone, right?”

Yang Ye glanced at the figure and said, “Lead the way.”

The figure smiled, “You seem to be in a rush.”

Suddenly, two waves of mysterious energy appeared in the surroundings.

Dual Domains!

At the same time, two intents enveloped the figure!

Dual Domains and dual intents!

Yang Ye stared at the ethereal figure, “Say another useless thing and I guarantee that no matter what happens between me and the End World, you will definitely die. Do you want to fucking try me?”

As soon as he finished speaking, a blood red sword floated above the figure’s head.

At this moment, the world fell silent!

While the figure didn’t say a word, the aura he emanated was very violent.

Yang Ye went over to the ethereal figure, “Even if I die here, I’m not someone trash like you can humiliate. Now, lead the way, and do so quietly. Understand?”
