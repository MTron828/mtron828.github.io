Chapter 2663 – Too Strong!

A battle was on the verge of breaking out at any moment before the wooden house!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye appeared between them. He glanced at the woman in black and said, “Can you give me some face?”

She laughed coldly.

Yang Ye felt quite helpless, “Be reasonable. Fighting Erya now is pointless. Even if you want revenge, you should at least wait until she has recovered, right? If you fight her now, you’re clearly bullying her, aren’t you?”

The woman in black glanced coldly at Erya. Meanwhile, Erya frowned, “Big Brother Yang, who is this woman? She acts like she’s really strong.”

Yang Ye walked over to Erya and whispered by her ear, “She was abandoned by her lover. So, her temper is terrible right now. I know you’re really sensible, so don’t make a fuss about it with her. Alright?”

Abandoned!

Erya blinked, glanced at the woman in black, and said, “I see. As the people of Big Sister Lianshuang’s hometown say, she was dumped!”

Yang Ye was stunned speechless.

Erya was like a child, so her anger came quickly, but vanished quickly too. She ignored the woman in black and went off to play with Snowy.

Only Yang Ye and the woman in black remained before the wooden house.

She sat cross-legged in the house with her eyes closed. Yang Ye noticed that there was a type of mysterious energy flowing around her.

Yang Ye remembered what the woman in white had told him. All of them possessed profound energy that was more extraordinary than Primordial Violet Energy. However, the woman in black still hadn’t left the Primordial Pagoda. Obviously, she hadn’t recovered completely.

Her injuries were definitely very serious, and they were absolutely not normal! Otherwise, based on her character, she would have attacked earlier. Moreover, she would have attacked in the End World as well!

Suddenly, the woman opened her eyes and gazed at Yang Ye, “What is it?”

Yang Ye walked over to her, thought for a moment, and said, “I want to ask about something. Where did you send Tian Xiu and Qi Bitian?”

It was something he’d always wanted to ask.

She replied indifferently, “I don’t know!”

Yang Ye glanced at her. He didn’t ask again and just left.

She definitely wouldn’t tell him. Based on her current state, if he found Tian Xiu and Qi Bitian, then she would definitely suffer. Especially when Erya was in the pagoda too!

A short while later, Yang Ye returned to the woman in black.

She frowned upon seeing Yang Ye return, “Why do you keep coming back?”

Yang Ye chuckled embarrassedly and said, “I want to seek your guidance on something.”

She replied coldly, “I’m busy!”

Yang Ye spoke quite helplessly, “Sigh, if only Little Qi was here. If she was here, I would definitely be able to improve tremendously. Ugh…”

He turned around and walked away.

Meanwhile, the woman suddenly said, “Wait!”

Yang Ye grinned, but it quickly vanished. He turned around to gaze at her and feigned bewilderment, “What is it?”

She gazed coldly at him, “Qi Bitian can make you stronger?”

Yang Ye spoke as a matter of course, “Of course. Look at me now. I’m only this strong, and my sword is this pure because of her guidance! Now that I’ve lost her guidance… Sigh!”

The woman in black ridiculed, “You’re really thick-skinned to think that your sword is pure!”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

Meanwhile, she flicked her sword forward.

Yang Ye’s expression changed slightly. He immediately drew his sword and swung it.

Bang!

An explosion resounded, and Yang Ye was blasted away.

He was blasted all the way out of the Sword Sect!

A short while later, Yang Ye returned to the wooden house. At this moment, his right hand was still trembling incessantly! He couldn’t stop it from trembling!

She spoke indifferently, “What do you think?”

Yang Ye spoke sincerely, “Very strong. It’s the strongest sword attack I’ve ever seen!”

He naturally had to flatter her at a time like this!

The woman was clearly very satisfied by his praise, and the coldness on her face faded quite a bit!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye asked, “Why was that attack so strong?”

She glanced at him, “Want to learn?”

Yang Ye nodded.

She said calmly, “Take me to a place!”

She had conditions!

Yang Ye had quite a strange expression on his face.

She really isn’t stupid.

The woman waved her right hand, and Yang Ye’s Myriad World Diagram appeared before her. She glanced at it, and then she flipped it over. There was nothing on the back of it.

Yang Ye gazed at her with slight bewilderment.

She waved her hand. Suddenly, five pitch black spots appeared on the back of the Myriad World Diagram. One on each corner, and a last one at the center.

She pointed at one of them and said, “Take me here!”

Yang Ye took the Myriad World Diagram from her. Even he hadn’t noticed that these dots were present on the back of the diagram… He fell silent for a short while before he gazed at her, “Can we teleport over there?”

She shook her head, “You’re too weak.”

Yang Ye was quite speechless, “I’m weak, but you aren’t!”

She replied coldly, “What’s with all the nonsense? Are you going to take me there or not?”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

A short while later, Yang Ye said, “Um… I can go there, but I’m sure you’ve realized that I’m being hunted by so many people. I-I’m very afraid!”

She gazed at him for a long time before she said, “I’ll make it worth your while, alright?”

Yang Ye blinked, “How?”

She replied indifferently, “You’re at the Destiny Realm, but your foundation and experience are insufficient. Even your cultivation is terrible. Ordinary Destiny Realm cultivators may be no match for you, but if you encounter experts like that saber cultivator from before, you’ll be no match for them. Their cultivations have reached their own limits…”

She gazed at Yang Ye at this point, “If you want to benefit and grow stronger, then take me there.”

Yang Ye fell silent for a short while and said, “One last question. You must tell me what that place is.”

She remained silent.

Yang Ye asked, “You can’t say?”

She replied indifferently, “I can. Those places on the back of the Myriad World Diagram are called Destiny Dimensions. They are dimensions I created when I was in my strongest form.”

Yang Ye was quite puzzled, “You created them yourself?”

She explained, “I was too strong at that time. The entire Three Dimensional Universe couldn’t accommodate my presence. So, I had no choice but to split myself, weaken my strength, and create those places. Understand?”

Yang Ye had quite an unusual expression on his face.

Too strong!

The Three Dimensional Universe couldn’t accommodate her presence!

How strong was Destiny’s original form? Even the Three Dimensional Universe couldn’t accommodate her presence? Wasn’t she a little too strong?

Yang Ye didn’t pursue an answer. He already knew what he should know.

Once he left the Primordial Pagoda, Yang Ye immediately rushed toward the Destiny Dimension.

The End World.

Explosions resounded incessantly in the sky above the End World. It went on for around two hours before the sky gradually calmed down.Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Meanwhile, a figure appeared there in the air.

It was Yin Yang Goddess.

Yin Yang Goddess glanced at the sky and smiled, “Heng Wangu, your strength has risen rapidly over the years!”

A voice resounded, “Yin Yang Goddess, I’ve already said what I should. If you continue causing trouble, then don’t blame us for showing no mercy.”

As soon as he finished speaking, a man appeared before Yin Yang Goddess.

Tai Huntian!

The same Tai Huntian Yang Ye had rescued the other day. Now, he was part of the End World!

Besides that, Zuo Mu had appeared behind her.

Yin Yang Goddess laughed coldly, “Bullying me with numbers? Just you wait! Everyone has some friends!”

She turned around and vanished on the spot.

Tai Huntian spoke coldly, “We should have killed that fellow!”

Zuo Mu shook his head slightly and left.

Heng Wangu said, “If she is easy to kill, we naturally would have. The problem is that she’s not easy to kill! Moreover, Yang Ye is our target!”

Tai Huntian glanced at the surroundings and asked, “How much longer will this place last?”

Heng Wangu replied, “Six months at most!”

Tai Huntian frowned.

There were two types of situations for the Destiny Realm experts of this world. One was being strong enough to fight Destiny, and even if they couldn’t defeat Destiny, they could escape her. Qi Bitian and Yin Yang Goddess were existences like that.

As for the other situation, it was where they were no match for Destiny and couldn’t escape her either.

Most of the existences in the End World were in the second situation!

Tai Huntian glanced at the surroundings and said, “Is there no way to save this place?”

“There is!” Heng Wangu explained, “Use the Sprite Progenitor as the core of a formation, and then force her to provide an endless supply of spirit energy. It may be possible to save this place that way!”

Tai Huntian said, “I guess you already have a plan!”

A moment of silence ensued, and then a voice resounded, “We’re just waiting for someone!”

…

The Desolate Dimension.

After the battle at Eternal Border, the Desolate Dimension had vanished from the eye of the public.

At a hall in the desolate race, the current patriarch of the desolate race, Huang Ying, was seated at the seat of the host while Huang Buer sat beside him!

All the experts of the desolate race were gathered here.

The atmosphere in the hall was quite heavy.

It was their first meeting since the battle!

Suddenly, Huang Ying stood up, “Our desolate race will never shrink back! Either Eternal Kingdom falls or we die!”

Huang Buer glanced at him and remained silent.

A short moment of silence filled the hall, and then all of them bowed in unison, “Our desolate race will fight the Eternal Kingdom to the death!”

Suddenly, a man walked in and fell to one knee, “Patriarch, someone outside seeks an audience with you!”

Huang Ying asked, “Who?”

The man replied, “He introduced himself as the patriarch of the undying race!”
