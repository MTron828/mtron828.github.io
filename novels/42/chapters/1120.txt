Chapter 1121 – Blood Must Be Repaid With Blood!

Outside White Deer City.

A smile curled up on the corners of the black robed man when he saw the barrier of light vanishing from the city, and then he started walking slowly towards the city while he said, “Attack! Enter the city!”

As soon as he spoke, those black clothed figures immediately shot towards the students outside the city walls.

Suddenly, a wave of the pungent smell of blood assaulted them, and it made their expressions change as they raised their heads to look at its source.

A ray of blood red light flashed!

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!

The heads of 5 black clothed figures shot towards the sky while accompanied by pillars of blood. A moment later, another ray of blood red light flashed, and then the heads of a few more black clothed figures flew into the air.

At this moment, all the black clothed figures recovered from their shock!

“How dare you!” The black robed man roared with fury and was about to attack. Suddenly, a blood figure grew larger within his eyes at a rapid pace. The black robed man’s pupils constricted slightly as he waved his dagger.

Clang!

An ear piercing clang resounded, and then the black clothed figures watched as the black robed man was blasted over 500m back!

All of them were stunned!

Meanwhile, the black robed man glanced at his dagger. At this moment, it had been chipped a little and was covered in cracks. He was slightly stunned by the sight of this, and then he raised his head to look towards the distance. At the same time, a ray of blood red light shot towards him, and it made his expression change. He didn’t dare act carelessly, and his profound energy surged into his damaged dagger before swinging it swiftly!

Bang!

The black clothed figures watched as the black robed man’s dagger shattered, and then his feet scraped against the ground as his figure was pushed over 1km away.

It was like a trench had been cut open on the ground!

The pupils of all the black clothed figures constricted, and there was astonishment in their eyes.

“Kill!” Suddenly, a wave of furious howls resounded, and then countless figures flashed out of the city. In the blink of an eye, countless experts from the city had surrounded those black clothed figures.

They didn’t waste their breaths at all and attacked immediately!

White Deer City always had the advantage in numbers and coupled with the fact that all of them were absolutely furious, the black clothed figures fell into a disadvantaged situation as soon as the battle broke out. But all of them were high-rank Saints in the end, so how could they be killed with such ease!

The students of White Deer Academy were in a heated battle with the black clothed figures.

As for Yang Ye, he didn’t waste his breath at all. He stomped his right foot against the ground and transformed into a ray of blood red light that shot towards the black robed man. In an instant, Yang Ye arrived before the black robed man. At the same time, the tip of his blood red sword had arrived in front of the black robed man’s chest.

The black robed man’s reaction wasn’t slow. The tip of Yang Ye’s sword had just arrived when the black robed man flipped his palm, and a new dagger appeared in his grasp before he swung it upwards.

Clang!

Yang Ye’s sword shook violently, and it was pushed off target. The black robed man grabbed this opportunity to tap his right foot against the ground, and then his figure pressed forward while stabbing his dagger towards Yang Ye’s throat.

Unexpectedly, Yang Ye didn’t dodge.

Clang!

The black robed man got his wish. His dagger stabbed against Yang Ye’s throat. However, he was astounded to notice that his dagger actually felt like it had stabbed against metal. Not only had he been unable to cut open Yang Ye’s throat, his hand even felt numb.

At this moment, the black robed man was astounded. At the same time, he cried out in his heart, Shit!

He was just about to retreat. However, Yang Ye’s blood red sword had been stabbed against his chest.

Hiss!

The sword stopped after stabbing in around 20 centimeters. Because the black robed man had grabbed Yang Ye’s sword with his left hand!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye stomped his right foot against the ground. The black robed man’s figure instantly moved almost 300m backwards yet Yang Ye’s sword was still stuck in his chest. At the same time, his sword had even stabbed a few centimeters deeper.

The black robed man was horrified. He swiftly stomped his right foot against the ground, and he moved backwards swiftly with the intention of avoiding this battle. However, Yang Ye pressed forward and followed closely as he moved backwards. Moreover, the blood red sword was still stabbing into his body while the blood within his body was spraying out like a fountain before converging into Yang Ye’s blood red sword.

It was sucking out his blood!

The sword in Yang Ye’s grasp was sucking the black robed man’s blood!

The black robed man had noticed it as well, and he was absolutely shocked. The profound energy within him instantly started surging, and then a terrifying imposing aura swept out from him like a storm and was about to blast Yang Ye away.

The aura of a Quasi Emperor was comparable to the might of the world! It was absolutely terrifying!

However, it had only just surged out when 2 strands of intent instantly surged out from within Yang Ye, and then the black robed man’s aura was suppressed and blasted into nothingness. A moment later, Yang Ye stomped his right foot against the ground, and the counterforce from it immediately blasted the black robed man almost 3km back!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye’s sword had almost stabbed through the black robed man’s back, and his left hand which was holding Yang Ye’s sword was completely bloody now. Even 2 of his fingers were gone.

He had no choice but to toss away the dagger in his right hand and grab Yang Ye’s sword with both hands.

“Break!” Yang Ye shouted as he stomped his right foot against the ground again. The black robed man was blasted another 3km back. This time, Yang Ye’s sword stabbed through the black robed man’s back, and it was crazily absorbing the black robed man’s blood while it remained lodged in his body. However, the black robed man didn’t stop resisting, and the profound energy within him surged madly to stop his blood from being absorbed by Heaven’s Gravestone!

However, there was despair in his heart right now.

Yang Ye’s strength was too powerful. Even he wasn’t able to resist Yang Ye’s physical strength, let alone Yang Ye’s speed. If he was as swift as Yang Ye, then he wouldn’t have fallen into such a situation.

Just a single careless mistake had caused him to fall into such a hopeless situation!

Suddenly, the black robed man howled furiously at the black clothed figures, “Help me!”

At this moment, he had to struggle free from this blood red figure before him. Because only then would he have a chance to launch a counterattack. Actually, it should be said that only then would he have a chance to survive. Otherwise, if this situation continued, then he would be sucked dry and transformed into a corpse.

The black clothed figures who were in battle with the students of White Deer Academy didn’t hesitate at all to immediately abandon their battles and charge at Yang Ye.

“Stop them!” Fang Yun roared with fury, and he charged at the black clothed figures. As for the other students behind him, they raised their speed to its limits to stop those black clothed figures.

Even though they did all they could, 2 black clothed figures had still charged out of the encirclement and arrived behind Yang Ye.

“Watch out!” Xuwu Shen hurriedly shouted to warn Yang Ye.

However, Yang Ye paid no attention to them, and he just took his sword in both hands and twisted it.

Hiss!

Numerous strands of blood instantly sprayed out of the black robed man’s hands. At this moment, his hands had almost been crippled!

Meanwhile, the 2 black clothed figures had arrived behind Yang Ye, and then 2 daggers shot towards his nape and back.

“You probably don’t have any strength left, right?” Yang Ye gazed at the black robed man while an evil smile curled up on the corners of his mouth. As soon as he finished speaking, a pair of wings suddenly appeared behind Yang Ye and flapped.

Hiss!

Yang Ye vanished on the spot, and he was 300m behind the black robed man when he appeared once more. As for the black robed man, his eyes were opened wide while his body had stiffened on the spot, and his eyes were filled with shock and disbelief.

There was a blood hole on his chest. At this moment, countless strands of blood and spirit energy were surging out of the hole. In the end, all of it surged to Yang Ye’s blood red sword and chest.

“A Half... Half-Saint.... I actually died at the hands of a Half....” He hadn’t even been able to finish speaking when Yang Ye suddenly appeared in front of him, and then a sword stabbed through the center of his forehead. The color in the black robed man’s eyes instantly vanished.

Yang Ye waved his right hand, and the black robed man’s corpse vanished on the spot. After that, Yang Ye vanished on the spot, and then a ray of blood red light flashed. One of the black clothed figures who’d arrived behind Yang Ye just a moment ago instantly stiffened on the spot, and then countless strands of spirit energy surged out from within him.

The spirit energy was instantly absorbed by Snowy who resided at Yang Ye’s chest. As for the blood within the black robed figure, it was completely absorbed by the blood red sword in Yang Ye’s grasp.

The other black clothed man was horrified. A moment later, he howled at the other black clothed figures who were in battle with the students of White Deer Academy, “Retreat! Retreat immediately!”

“Retreat? Where will you retreat to?” Yang Ye appeared in front of the black clothed figure who’d ordered the retreat. The black clothed man was horrified, and he didn’t hesitate to swing his dagger at Yang Ye.

Clang!

A clear and melodious sound of collision resounded, and then the dagger shattered in an instant. As for the black clothed man, he was blasted back by the powerful force contained within Yang Ye’s attack.

A ray of blood red light flashed!

Hiss!

A ray of blood red sword energy pierced through the black clothed man’s chest, and then his figure stiffened on the spot while the color in his eyes faded.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye had vanished on the spot and charged into the group of black clothed figures.

The battle instantly became one-sided once Yang Ye joined it.

It took less than 15 minutes for a few dozen high-rank Saints to be annihilated by the joint forces of Yang Ye and the others.

Yang Ye glanced at the black clothed corpses here, and then he waved his right hand and placed them within the ancient sheath. After that, he looked up at the sky.

Fang Yun arrived by Yang Ye’s side and asked, “What do we do now?” The other students of the academy were standing behind Fang Yun.

Obviously, they took Yang Ye to be their leader right now.

“A debt of blood must be repaid with blood!” As soon as he finished speaking, his figure transformed into a ray of blood red light which shot towards the sky and went straight for the pocket of space in the sky above!
