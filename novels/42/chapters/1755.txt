Chapter 1756 – The Ruthless Win!

In the next few days, Yang Ye did nothing but accompany Su Qingshi and the others.

Actually, if he could choose, he would rather choose to live a peaceful and ordinary life with them.

He really had no desire towards money, authority, and eternal life.

However, a peaceful and ordinary life was like a dream to him!

Just like the women in a red dress in Moment Mountain had said, at the same time that he obtained all sorts of fortuitous encounters, he’d been bound by all sorts of karma, and that karma would take his life.

Grow stronger!

Grow stronger incessantly! Because it was the only way to survive, and it was the only way to protect those he loved.

The Ye Estate.

Now, Yang Ye was the Yang Clan’s guardian, so he had his own estate. Moreover, it wasn’t smaller than Yang Lianshuang’s estate. Even though Yang Lianshuang was the Yang Clan’s patriarch, Yang Ye’s status in the hearts of everyone wasn’t any lower.

In the courtyard.

Lei Lin and Xue’er were playing in the spacious courtyard. Yang Ye wasn’t very far away from them, and both Su Qingshi and Zhuang Weiran were by his side.

Yang Ye gazed at Zhuang Weiran, “You’ve attained the Zenith Realm too?”

She nodded slightly, “I have!”

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment, and then he flipped his palm. The halberd appeared in his grasp. He passed it to Zhuang Weiran, “I think you’re much more suitable than I am!”

He was a sword cultivator, so it was quite weird to use a halberd. Because all he knew was to slam it against his opponents!

She glanced at the halberd and didn’t refuse. As soon as she took it in her grasp, the halberd shook violently, and the sight of this made Yang Ye frown.

If it refused to acknowledge Zhuang Weiran, then even he couldn’t do anything about it. After all, it required mutual agreement!

Suddenly, the halberd calmed down, and then a ray of light entered the center of her forehead.

A long time passed before she gazed at Yang Ye, “The Unrivaled Technique?”

Yang Ye nodded, “You can cultivate it! It’s very strong!”

She nodded and didn’t say anything else.

Yang Ye glanced at Zhuang Weiran and Su Qingshi, and he chuckled bitterly. Both of them were like mysteries, and they didn’t like to speak. Fortunately, no conflict had arisen between them. That was what he was worried about the most because the most troublesome issue was when one’s wives fought each other.

Luckily, they got along quite well!

Zhuang Weiran suddenly asked, “You’re afraid we’ll argue with each other?”

Yang Ye was stunned, and then he nodded.

She shook her head slightly, “We won’t!”

Meanwhile, Su Qingshi said, “Before we came here, the members of the Yang Clan told us that someone wanted to threaten you with Merak System, so you didn’t hesitate to fight the world and pull all that pressure onto yourself.”

She walked over to Yang Ye and gently touched his cheek, “Do you know why I fell for you all those years ago?”

Yang Ye took her hand and smiled, “Is it because I’m handsome?”

She shook her head slightly, “Responsibility. I gathered information on you. I feel that the most handsome part about a man isn’t his outward appearance or his strength, it’s his willingness to bear responsibility and be responsible. No matter how strong a man is, if he doesn’t have a sense of responsibility, then he would be trash to me.”

She paused for a moment and continued, “You were very weak, extremely weak, and I could have killed you with a single finger. However you felt like a real man. Because you never gave up for the sake of your mother and sister, and you shouldered the responsibilities that belonged to you.”

Yang Ye fell silent.Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Meanwhile, Su Qingshi suddenly took his hand and continued, “We won’t get into fights with each other. If we would, we wouldn’t have chosen to stay with you.”

Yang Ye took both their hands and spoke softly, “It’s so nice to have both of you by my side!”

A day later, Yang Ye stopped accompanying them and entered the Primordial Pagoda.

Cultivate!

After Su Qingshi and the others came to the Milky Way System, the responsibilities he shouldered had grown even heavier, and the only way to shoulder them was to grow stronger!

The battle with Yang Xiang allowed Yang Ye to realize that his strength was still not a threat to experts of that level, and every single clan had such experts. Besides that, there were other monstrous geniuses.

Just like Yang Lianshuang. Such monstrous geniuses may be at a lower realm of cultivation than Yang Xiang, but their true strength was sufficient to fight Yang Xiang.

There were some people in this world who couldn’t be judged by convention.

There were no shortcuts in cultivation!

Train!

Train to the death!

However, he wasn’t training his sword technique this time, he was training with the Laws. The reason his sword techniques and moves were so strong and swift was the Laws he possessed. Those Laws could be improved. For example, his attainments in the Laws of Darkness was clearly much superior to his attainments in the other Laws!

Once his attainments in the Laws improved, his sword techniques and moves would improve with them.

Besides training, only comprehension could help him improve them.

This time, he used the Sword Domain.

He could sense the energy of the Laws while within the Sword Domain. Sensing space while within the Sword Domain was completely different from doing it outside the Sword Domain. Because he could sense everything while he was within the Sword Domain!

Half a month later.

Since Yang Lianshuang became the patriarch of the Yang Clan, the Yang Clan underwent a series of reforms.

If it was in the past, these reforms would definitely cause many to oppose it. Yet now, Yang Lianshuang’s decisions were final throughout the Yang Clan, and no one dared to oppose them. At the same time, Yang Lianshuang had summoned back all the experts of the Yang Clan which were away from the Yang Clan!

Phecda Hall.

Yang Lianshuang was at the seat of the host, and the True Realm experts of the Yang Clan were down below. At this moment, all the True Realm experts of the Yang Clan were here.

There weren’t many True Realm experts here. There were only less than 20 of them. The Yang Clan’s current forces were absolutely the weakest amongst the eight clans right now. It was because of the internal strife that the Yang Clan had gone true. The Yang Clan had lost too many of its True Realm experts!

Yang Lianshuang said, “Tell me about the Ying Clan and the other clans’ recent movements!”

Yang Xuan stepped forward, “Besides the Ku Clan and Wu Clan, the other five clans have started to act against those worlds of ours. In the beginning, they didn’t dare to do it openly, yet now, they’ve started to openly occupy those worlds of ours.”

She paused for a moment at this point and said, “As you ordered, we haven’t fought back and retreated from those worlds. But….”

Yang Lianshuang, “But that will make the world think that our Yang Clan is easy to bully, right?”

Yang Xuan nodded, “I’m sure you’re aware that it’s useless to keep backing down. The more we do that, the more they’ll think that we’re easy to bully. In the end, they’ll try to push their luck even further, and it’ll be a blow to our Yang Clan’s morale.”

Yang Lianshuang stood up slowly. She glanced at the people here and said, “We won’t just constantly back down, of course. We’re going to fight! But we can’t fight them like that!”

Yang Xuan asked, “Then how will we fight?”

Yang Lianshuang fell silent for a moment and said, “By converging our strength! Our strength isn’t sufficient to protect those worlds, and forcefully protecting them won’t just make us lose those worlds, we’ll lose our True Realm experts. So, we can only give up those worlds in order to keep our True Realm experts alive!”

She paused for a moment and continued, “The reason I made all of you return from the worlds you were protecting is that we can’t allow our strength to be dispersed. We have to converge our strength and strike a lethal blow on them.”

The others nodded as they understood what she meant.

The Yang Clan’s current strength was much inferior to what it had been. If they forcefully protected those worlds, they would definitely lose many of their forces. So, Yang Lianshuang had decisively abandoned those worlds to preserve the Yang Clan’s strength and its True Realm experts.

Lost territory could be taken back, but while new experts could be fostered again, it wasn’t that easy to foster another True Realm expert.

Yang Xuan asked, “When are we going to counterattack?”

Everyone gazed at Yang Lianshuang.

The Yang Clan naturally had to counterattack, and it was a certain fact. Otherwise, if this continued, the Yang Clan wouldn’t just lose many worlds, the entire world would think that the Yang Clan was easy to bully. At that time, those clans wouldn’t be the only ones who fought and took the Yang Clan’s territory, even the other smaller powers may try as well!

Yang Lianshuang fell silent for a moment. She was about to speak when she suddenly looked out the hall. Yang Ye had appeared at the entrance to the hall.

Everyone gazed at Yang Ye as well.

Yang Lianshuang asked, “You’ve finished cultivating?”

Yang Ye nodded. Even though only half a month had passed in the outside world, he’d been cultivating for months within the Primordial Pagoda.

Yang Lianshuang sized up Yang Ye and said, “You’ve grown stronger!”

Yang Ye smiled, “Sort of!”

Yang Lianshuang nodded slightly and said, “I’m sure you heard our discussion. What do you think?”

Yang Ye glanced at the people here and replied, “My opinion is similar to yours. We’ll fight! But we’re going to crush them!”

Yang Lianshuang asked, “Please do tell!”

Yang Ye walked into the hall and said, “I’m sure all of you have gotten into fights when you were children. Our own strength is absolutely insufficient to face a group of opponents. Under such circumstances, we can only grab one of them and crush that person! Only then will we be able to avoid suffering for nothing. When it comes to fights between people, it’s always the ruthless that wins.”

He took a deep breath at this point and continued, “So, we have to crush our opponent in this first battle. Forget about the other clans and just crush a single clan!”
