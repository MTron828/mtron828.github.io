Chapter 1775 – The Wooden Sword Vs The Primordial Pagoda!

The voice was quite familiar to Yang Ye, and it didn’t take long for him to figure out who it belonged to.

It was that woman in a white dress who had given him the teleportation scroll outside Sword Immortal City!

But how did she find me?

Yang Ye didn’t think too much about it and just walked out of the cave. There was a woman standing at the cave’s entrance, and it was the woman in a white dress.

Yang Ye asked, “How did you find me?”

Suddenly, a ray of white light flashed, and then Snowy appeared before him with the wooden sword in her grasp. Snowy pointed at the wooden sword…

The wooden sword did it! Yang Ye glanced at the wooden sword. He hadn’t expected it to reveal his location to the woman.

Meanwhile, she suddenly asked, “What’s the meaning of this?”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “What do you mean?”

She replied coldly, “The Ying Clan and those other clans outside!”

Yang Ye said, “They were pursuing me.”

She asked, “So you came to the Secret Sect?”

Yang Ye nodded.

She looked him in the eyes, “Do you want the Secret Sect to fight with them, and then benefit from it?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “No, that’s not my intention. I just didn’t have a place to go. Of course, if the Secret Sect doesn’t want me here, then I can leave right now.”

I wasn’t a fool. So, he would naturally not think that he could make the Secret Sect fight those five clans for him. After all, the higher-ups of the Secret Sect and those clans were no fools. If they hadn’t noticed his presence, then he would naturally not leave. At the very least, he wouldn’t leave right now.

Yet now, she’d found him, so staying here would be no different than intentionally creating trouble for them.

He didn’t want the Secret Sect to become an enemy of his as well!

Yang Ye didn’t hesitate to turn around and walk away.

“Wait!” Suddenly, she said, “You can leave, but leave the sword behind!”

Yang Ye gazed at the wooden sword, and then he tossed it over to her. Snowy blinked and was about to take it back, but Yang Ye suddenly stopped her, “Leave it.”

He really didn’t want the wooden sword anymore. It had actually exposed his whereabouts. Fortunately, the woman didn’t have any ill intent. Otherwise, he would probably be surrounded by a few dozen True Realm experts by now!

Snowy instantly seemed sad when she heard Yang Ye, and her eyes were even filled with pearls of tears.

Yang Ye released her and said, “Go stay with it then!”

Yang Ye turned around and walked away once he finished speaking.

Snowy was stunned for a moment, and then she seemed to have understood something. Her tears instantly surged out from her eyes. She immediately flashed over to Yang Ye, grabbed his arm tightly, and then looked at him with a pitiable gaze.

Yang Ye’s heart hurt when he saw her like that, and his expression eased up, “It’s not one of us. So, leave it. Alright?”

Snowy hurriedly nodded. This time, she didn’t dare to be mischievous.

Yang Ye rubbed her head gently and said, “I’ll find a better sword for you!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he took her in his arms and intended to leave. However, the wooden sword suddenly appeared in front of him, and then it transformed into a ray of light that entered the Primordial Pagoda.

Yang Ye had an indifferent expression on his face as he immersed his consciousness into his body, and he said, “Kick it out!”

The Primordial Pagoda shook violently, and then a wave of powerful energy instantly enveloped the wooden sword within the pagoda.

The wooden sword didn’t just stand by idly, and it resisted the Primordial Pagoda!

Rays of sword energy flashed out incessantly from within it!

Yang Ye’s eyelids twitched. It’s really brave! It even dares to resist the Primordial Pagoda!

Obviously, the Primordial Pagoda was infuriated by this.

A wave of energy that was even stronger than the last one enveloped the wooden sword, and the rays of sword energy were instantly obliterated. A moment later, a ray of light flashed out from Yang Ye’s chest, and the wooden sword appeared 3km away!

It had been kicked out!

The wooden sword shook slightly, and then it transformed into a ray of light that entered Yang Ye’s body. However, not even half a breath of time passed before it was kicked out again!

Just like that, the wooden sword kept trying to enter the Primordial Pagoda but failed to do so!

In the end, it gave up.

It went over to Yang Ye. Or to be more precise, it went over to Snowy. The latter glanced at the wooden sword before looking away.L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Meanwhile, Yang Ye said, “I don’t care what kind of sword you are. You have your own temper, and I understand that. After all, everyone with strength has a temper. But what I want to tell you is that I have a temper of my own. Since we can’t get along with each other, then let’s go our separate ways!”

Yang Ye turned around and walked away once he finished speaking. He was really displeased by the fact that the wooden sword had exposed his whereabouts. It wouldn’t be a problem if the wooden sword had asked his permission, but it hadn’t! It has exposed his whereabouts to the woman without his consent.

If the woman in a white dress notified the Secret Sect and the Ying Clan’s coalition, then it was obvious what would happen. Most importantly, this incident allowed him to realize that the wooden sword really wasn’t on the same side as him.

However, Yang Ye hadn’t even taken two steps away when the wooden sword appeared in front of him again.

Yang Ye frowned. Meanwhile, the woman in a white dress spoke abruptly, “It didn’t have any ill intent when it exposed your whereabouts. It was because it thought you were here to see me.”

Yang Ye shook his head, “It isn’t important.” He gazed at the wooden sword and continued, “No matter what, we’ve worked together on many occasions, so let’s just part ways peacefully!”

The wooden sword shook slightly and seemed to be saying something.

The woman’s expression changed when she witnessed this scene, and her eyes had a trace of disbelief in them.

She knew what the wooden sword was saying. It was actually admitting its mistakes! Moreover, it was guaranteeing that it would absolutely not expose his whereabouts again unless it gained his permission!

It’s admitting its mistakes! She stared at Yang Ye as if she wanted to see through him!

Yang Ye naturally understood what the wooden sword meant. He hadn’t expected it to actually admit its mistakes because it was extremely proud, and that was obvious from how it dared to fight the Primordial Pagoda just now. But it was admitting its mistakes now. Yang Ye knew that a huge reason for that was definitely Snowy and the Primordial Pagoda.

The wooden sword was very close to Snowy. Snowy didn’t want to leave it, and it didn’t want to leave Snowy.

Yang Ye looked down at Snowy, and she was looking up at him. She blinked and wanted to say something, but she didn’t say anything in the end. However, how could Yang Ye not know what she was thinking? She wanted to plead on behalf of the wooden sword, but she was afraid that he would get angry.

Yang Ye rubbed her head gently and said, “As long as you like it!”

Snowy blinked when she heard him, and then her eyes lit up. She’d clearly understood what he meant. So, she pulled the wooden sword over to her, but the smile on her face vanished.

She pointed her little claw at it, and then started to wave about the other claw while a serious expression covered her tiny face.

Snowy was educating the wooden sword! The gist of it was that the wooden sword shouldn’t offend Yang Ye again or tell anyone where Yang Ye and her were….

The wooden sword had no objections towards Snowy’s requests, and it agreed to every one of them. Of course, it actually didn’t really understand everything. It wasn’t the only one which didn’t understand, even Snowy didn’t really understand. In any case, she just didn’t want it to make Yang Ye angry because Yang Ye was extremely terrifying when he was angry!

In the end, Snowy happily returned to the Primordial Pagoda with the wooden sword in her arms. This time, the Primordial Pagoda didn’t stop the wooden sword from entering.

Yang Ye didn’t stay a moment longer, and he immediately turned around and walked away. But he’d only taken two steps when he seemed to have thought of something, and he turned to look at the woman, “I’m not trying to keep it, it chose to stay with me. So, I hope you understand!”

The woman in a white dress fell silent. What could she do? Did the wooden sword belong to the Secret Sect? Not really. It would be fine if the wooden sword chose her, but it wanted to go with Yang Ye. So, if she forced Yang Ye to hand it over, she would be bullying him!

But the fellow before her wasn’t that easy to bully!

Yang Ye didn’t say another word. He just turned around and walked away.

However, the woman suddenly spoke, “I’ll take you to the Secret Sect!”

Yang Ye turned to look at her, and she said, “You won’t be able to leave. The formation has been activated and countless experts are guarding the area. Even the slightest movement will be noticed by them.”

Yang Ye said, “Going to the Secret Sect with you will cause trouble for all of you!”

She replied, “We can deal with it! Come with me!”

She vanished on the spot.

Yang Ye shrugged and quickly followed after her. It didn’t take long for them to arrive before a mountain that towered into the clouds.

Yang Ye asked, “The Secret Sect is up there?”

She nodded slightly, and then gazed at Yang Ye, “Stay here for now. I’ll go tell them that you’ve left the Secret Sect.”

Yang Ye asked, “Will they believe you?”

She replied indifferently, “They have to even if they don’t want to!”

As soon as she finished speaking, she turned around with the intent to leave. But she seemed to have thought of something and turned back to look at Yang Ye, “Stay here and don’t go anywhere. Your presence here can’t be exposed yet. Because no one in my Secret Sect knows you. If you’re found, no one will be able to help you!”

Yang Ye nodded, “Alright, I won’t go anywhere!”

She nodded and vanished on the spot.

After she left, Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings and hid in a corner.

Around 15 minutes later, a ray of white light suddenly floated through the sky. Yang Ye looked up at it, and then the ray of light suddenly stopped and descended before Yang Ye.

Yang Ye was stunned when he saw the person before him, and he said, “It’s you!”
