Chapter 1700 - The Wine And Poetry Immortal!

The words were written with grand and beautiful strokes, and they felt elegant and unrestrained.

“Li Taibai!” Suddenly, a man with a sword on his back and a woman appeared by Yang Ye’s side. The man gazed at the writing, “The Sword Immortal, Li Taibai. Supposedly, he wasn’t just fond of the sword, he was fond of poetry and wine too. So, he was also called the Wine Immortal and Poetry Immortal!”

The Wine Immortal! The Poetry Immortal! Yang Ye nodded slightly, and then he gazed at them. The man was around the age of 25, had clear features, a sword on his back, and emanated a faint strand of sword intent. The woman was slightly younger and seemed just around 20 years of age. She wore a tight green dress, and her figure was very good. Her figure wasn’t the only thing that was good, she was very beautiful too!

There was a sword hanging on her waist.

The man suddenly asked, “Brother, are you here for the Sword Immortal’s inheritance too?”

Yang Ye nodded, “Sort of. However, I mostly just want to meet that Sword Immortal.”

The man smiled, “My sister and I are here to meet him too. We aren’t the only ones. I’m afraid all the sword cultivators in the world are here.”

Yang Ye was quite surprised, “All the sword cultivators in the world?”

The man nodded, “Li Taibai came from the small universe. What sort of place is that? It’s where our human race’s civilization of cultivation began. Even though Li Taibai isn’t an ancient cultivator, he’d one of the first to start cultivating. I think that many sword cultivators would like to see how strong such a sword cultivator is!”

Yang Ye turned to look into the city, “Then let’s go!”

It didn’t take long for them to enter the city.

During their conversation, Yang Ye found out that the man’s name was Xiao Jian, and the woman was Xiao Youshui. They were siblings, and both were at the Zenith Realm. It wasn’t just their cultivation, even their sword intent was at the Zenith Rank, just like him. This made Yang Ye feel quite surprised!

Sword Immortal City wasn’t huge, but it was exquisite. There were very few buildings in the city, so it seemed very spacious.

All along the way, Yang Ye met many sword cultivators. Most of them were extremely strong. Especially some that even gave him a sense of danger.

There was always someone stronger!

Yang Ye had never thought that he was the number one sword cultivator in the world. There were too many experts in the world, so it was best to be humble and keep a low profile. Of course, he would make a show of strength when necessary!

Xiao Jian suddenly asked, “Brother Ye Yang, you’re going to Phoenix Cry Mountain right now?”

Yang Ye gazed at Xiao Jian, “Why? You’re not going now?” Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Xiao Jian shook his head slightly, “Not now. Because a Sword Conference is being held tomorrow. We intend to head to Phoenix Cry Mountain after the conference.”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “A Sword Conference?”

Xiao Jian replied, “You don’t know about it?”

Yang Ye shook his head.

Xiao Jian glanced at Yang Ye and explained, “It’s hosted by Li Fengyu.” He gazed at Yang Ye and continued, “You should know Li Fengyu, right?”

Yang Ye shook his head again.

At this moment, both brother and sister had surprised expressions on their faces.

Yang Ye asked, “Is he very famous?”

Xiao Jian laughed bitterly, “He isn’t just famous, he’s ranked at the 4th position on the Milky Way Rankings. There’s a saying in our medium universe of Milky Way System — Fengyu of the South and Lincang of the North. They are the only known sword cultivators to have attained the True Rank in sword intent.”

The True Rank in sword intent! Yang Ye was visibly moved. Because possessing True Rank sword intent was quite amazing. Needless to say, all sorts of formidable experts were hidden in the medium universe of Milky Way System!

Meanwhile, Xiao Jian added, “Everyone has their own Sword Dao, and everyone’s Sword Dao is different. If all the sword cultivators of the medium universe can sit down and discuss it, then I’m sure it’ll be beneficial for everyone.”

Yang Ye nodded. Everyone’s Sword Dao was different, and the way they cultivated varied as well. If they sat down and discussed with each other for a while, it would definitely be beneficial to all of them. After all, a sword cultivator’s achievements would be limited if that person remains shut off from the outside world.

Xiao Jian asked, “Brother Ye, are you going to participate too?”

Yang Ye replied, “Of course!” He had encountered formidable sword cultivators in the past. For example, the Unfettered One. However, that fellow had always been a legend, so he hadn’t been able to discuss the Sword Dao with the Unfettered One.

Now that he’d encountered so many formidable sword cultivators, he was certain that if he could discuss the Sword Dao with them, then it would definitely be tremendously helpful to his Sword Dao.

Xiao Jian nodded and smiled, “Then let’s head to the Grand Immortal Pavilion in the city.”

Yang Ye asked, “The Grand Immortal Pavilion? What’s that?”

Xiao Jian replied, “The place where Li Taibai used to spend time at, and it’s the most renowned place in the city. Supposedly, Li Taibai left a sword technique in the Grand Immortal Pavilion. Unfortunately, no one has been able to comprehend it. Let’s go try our luck!”

Yang Ye nodded. Just like that, the three of them headed towards the Grand Immortal Pavilion.

…

The Grand Immortal Pavilion.

As they traveled, Xiao Jian explained, “The Grand Immortal Pavilion isn’t huge, and it only has three floors. They are the Heaven, Earth, and Mortal Floors. Even though it isn’t huge, it isn’t easy to enter. Especially the Heaven Floor. I’m afraid only Li Fengyu and Qin Lincang can enter that floor!”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Why?”

Xiao Jian smiled, “You’ll find out soon!”

Yang Ye nodded and didn’t ask again.

It didn’t take long for them to arrive at Grand Immortal Pavilion.

Xiao Jian smiled, “Come, let’s go in.”

As soon as they arrived at its entrance, a barrier of light appeared there. Yang Ye was puzzled and gazed at Xiao Jian. Xiao Jian smiled, and then he placed his right palm on the barrier. A strand of sword intent instantly emerged from his palm, and then the barrier of light trembled and dispersed slowly.

Xiao Jian gazed at Yang Ye and smiled, “The 1st floor’s requirement is comparatively low. It only requires Returnal Rank sword intent to enter.” As he spoke, he walked into the building.

Once Xiao Jian entered, the barrier of light appeared once more.

Xiao Youshui didn’t say a word. She just walked over to the barrier and placed her right palm against it. In next to no time, it dispersed, and she entered the pavilion.

Yang Ye shrugged and walked over to the entrance as well. Nothing unexpected happened, and he smoothly entered the Mortal Floor.

The pavilion wasn’t very large. There were tables and chairs in the pavilion, and all of them were made from strange wooden swords. Even the floorboard was made from numerous wooden swords. Besides that, there was a strand of faint sword intent in the surroundings.

The sword intent wasn’t sharp, and it was even gentle. It felt extremely comfortable.

There were quite many sword cultivators in the hall here. There were over 100 of them.

Over 100 was quite a huge amount!

Because the weakest amongst them possessed Returnal Rank sword intent!

Meanwhile, Xiao Jian said, “Brother Ye, we’re heading up to the Earth Floor.”

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings and said, “I’ll go with you.”

Xiao Jian was stunned, “Your sword intent is at the Zenith Rank too?”

Xiao Youshui, who’d been silent until now, gazed at Yang Ye as well.

Yang Ye nodded in response.

Xiao Jian and Xiao Youshui exchanged glances. Needless to say, they were quite surprised. Because Yang Ye hadn’t concealed his cultivation. In other words, they knew he was at the Rebirth Realm. A Rebirth Realm cultivator possessing Zenith Rank sword intent. It wasn’t unheard of, but it was rare. At the very least, they’d attained the Zenith Realm before attaining the Zenith Rank in sword intent!

A moment of silence passed before Xiao Jian smiled, “Then let’s head upstairs!”

It didn’t take long for them to arrive at the entrance to the second floor. Xiao Jian walked over to the barrier of light, and then a strand of sword intent surged out from within him. Once his sword intent came into contact with the barrier of light, the barrier of light dispersed in an instant.

Xiao Jian nodded to Yang Ye and walked in.

It didn’t take long for Xiao Youshui to enter the second floor as well.

As expected, Yang Ye smoothly entered the second floor.

As soon as they arrived at the second floor, many gazes descended upon them. Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings. There were comparatively fewer people here. There were only around 40 here. However, their sword intent was at the Zenith Rank at least!

Yang Ye was visibly moved!

At this moment, he finally understood what it was like to have countless experts hidden all around the world!

Xiao Jian nodded slightly to them, and then he led Yang Ye and Xiao Youshui over to a window.

Xiao Jian pointed up to the clouds outside the window, “Look!”

Yang Ye looked where he was pointing, and Yang Ye saw a line of words far above them — ‘Never stop drinking, even when the cup is almost empty. Please hear my song, please sing with me… In your beautiful dress and mighty steed. Tell them to bring more wine, and drink we shall until the night ends.”

“Until the night ends!” Xiao Jian said, “As expected of the Sword Immortal. Such an unrestrained bearing. We are far from being on par with him!”

Yang Ye nodded. Even though he’d never met the Sword Immortal, he was able to discern that Li Taibai was no ordinary person. Especially how unrestrained he seemed to be. It was something that very few in this world could accomplish.

A moment of silence ensued, and then Yang Ye said, “Is his sword technique within those words?”

Xiao Jian replied, “That’s what they say.”

Yang Ye nodded and looked up. He looked for a long time before he shook his head, “I don’t see anything.”

Suddenly, Xiao Youshui said, “I do!”

Yang Ye and Xiao Jian immediately gazed at her. Yang Ye’s eyes were filled with bewilderment while Xiao Jian’s eyes were filled with happiness.

Xiao Youshui didn’t speak, and she just gazed at the words in the air.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye couldn’t help but ask, “Is it really there?”

Xiao Youshui glanced at him and didn’t say a word.

Yang Ye felt speechless from her reaction.

Suddenly, a ray of white light flashed, and then Snowy appeared before Yang Ye while holding the wooden sword.

Yang Ye, Xiao Jian, and Xiao Youshui were stunned.

Yang Ye was about to speak when Snowy went over to the third floor’s entrance.

Yang Ye was stunned speechless.
