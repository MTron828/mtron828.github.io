Chapter 2109 – Armless Man!

The middle aged man smiled, “You’re too vigilant toward others!”

Yang Ye spoke indifferently, “Does the Dao Path want something?”

The middle aged man nodded, “We want you to go to the Dao Path.”

Yang Ye asked, “What for?”

The middle aged man replied, “I’m sure you’ve heard about the fight between Paths, right?”

Yang Ye frowned, “What are you trying to say?”

The middle aged man said, “The fight between Paths is a fight for belief. There are four paths people believe in within this large universe. Since there are beliefs, there are conflicts.”

Yang Ye spoke in a low voice, “Isn’t it alright to believe in your own thing? Why get into conflict with each other?”

The middle aged man smiled, “No matter what, you’re a part of the Dao Path, so you have to go to the Dao Path and have a look, right?”

Yang Ye fell silent for a long time before he said, “Alright, I’ll go!”

The middle aged man nodded slightly, and then he formed a strange seal. In an instant, a formation in the shape of the eight trigrams appeared beneath Yang Ye’s feet, and then both of them vanished on the spot.

Teleportation!

At this moment, Yang Ye and the middle aged man were traveling through space, and they were so fast that he couldn’t even react to it.

A long time passed before Yang Ye felt the space around them stop.

Yang Ye opened his eyes and glanced at the surroundings. There was a mountain beneath them, and towering mountains stood all around them.

The middle aged man tapped his foot lightly against the ground and said, “Do you know what this mountain is?”

Yang Ye shook his head.

The middle aged man smiled, “The Ninth Sword Mountain!”

Ninth Sword Mountain!

Yang Ye gazed at the middle aged man. Ninth Sword was the name the old man in Daoists’ robes had given him, it was his Daoist Name.

The middle aged man said, “Young Junior Brother, Master has actually not forgotten you. While he didn’t do anything when the Sage Alliance targeted you, it doesn’t represent that he doesn’t care about you. You aren’t the only one, Master left all of us to our own devices too. He gave us freedom to do as we pleased, and he won’t stay by our side at all times. Geniuses that are grown under protection can’t be considered as true geniuses. Just like tigers reared by someone, they may be weaker than a wolf that grew up in a forest!”

Yang Ye asked, “What’s his objective?”

The middle aged man grinned, “Come with me!”

Yang Ye followed the middle aged man to an abode, and the middle aged man said, “Our Dao Path stresses upon quiet cultivation devoid of any desires. This will be your abode from now on. You can name it yourself.”

Yang Ye said, “I don’t like to beat around the bush, so just be frank.”

The middle aged man fell silent for a moment and said, “All the races, the god race, the four paths, and some other mysterious organizations have been swept into a vortex. The four paths seem like they haven’t been swept into it, but they’ve actually been swept into it from a long time ago. The large universe is about to welcome a reshuffle.”

Yang Ye spoke solemnly, “That really puzzles me. The god race isn’t the same god race it used to be. So, if all four paths join forces, it shouldn’t be difficult to annihilate them, right?”

“It’s difficult!” The middle aged man shook his head, “Do you know why the four paths dare not act against them?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “I don’t.”

The middle aged man said, “The main reason is that the spirits of the universe are siding with the god race!”

Yang Ye frowned slightly, “The spirits of the universe?”

The middle aged man nodded, “There are countless sprites in the world, like the Sprite Lord and Sprite Kings. So, there are Universe Sprites too, the spirits of this universe. They were born with this universe, and they are Sprites that were nourished by this universe for countless years. The god race has gained their support. So, none of the four paths have dared to act rashly.”

Yang Ye asked, “Is it very strong?”

The middle aged man smiled, “It’s called the Universe Sprite, can it be weak? If it hadn’t been on our side, it would have been difficult for the joint forces of all the races and the four paths to crush the god race.”

Yang Ye asked, “Then why is it siding with the god race now?”

The middle aged man shook his head slightly, “Greed. The god race was extremely strong all those years ago, but it made them extremely proud too. They were so proud that they considered themselves above the Universe Sprite of this universe. However, the Universe Sprite was not ordinary as well. It knew the god race was formidable, so it didn’t go against them, and it allowed them to become overlord of the universe. At that time, it secretly helped the other races. Just like that, time trickled by, and the races and four paths grew stronger and stronger. Finally, the god race felt threatened and wanted to enslave the races, but it was too late!”

The middle aged man paused for a moment and continued, “Now, it’s siding with the god race. As for the reason, it’s very simple. The races and the four paths are too strong. It doesn’t want the universe to be ruled over by any single race. It's what they call a balancing act. Just like what Emperors do in the mortal world. If an Emperor’s subordinate gets too powerful, they must be suppressed. The four paths and the other races are the side that must be suppressed! Of course, that’s our own guess, and only the Universe Sprite is aware of the true reason.”

Yang Ye spoke solemnly, “The four paths and the other races won’t just sit there and wait for death to arrive, right?”

The middle aged man smiled, “Of course. However, it has become complicated now. The Universe Sprite vanished after it led us to victory against the god race, and no one knows how strong it has become during this period. That’s what the four paths truly fear.”

Yang Ye asked, “There’s definitely a reason why I’ve been brought back to the Dao Path now, right?”

The middle aged man smiled, “We want you to represent the Dao Path and pay a visit to the Buddhist Path, Confucianist Path, and Weapon Path!”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Why?”

“Tradition!” The middle aged man continued, “The younger generation of every path will pay a visit to the other three paths. There are two reasons for that. Firstly, it’s to notify the other parts that you’re a successor of the Dao Path, and you’re the representative of the Dao Path’s younger generation. Secondly, it’s naturally to make the other three paths abide by some rules when dealing with you. If you pay a visit to them while representing the Dao Path, it represents that the Dao Path has truly acknowledged your identity, and the other three paths won’t act against you anymore.”

He paused for a moment at this point and continued, “Besides that, it’s to make a display of the Dao Path’s strength. Your visit will definitely not be peaceful, just like what happens when the disciples of the other paths pay a visit to the Dao Path. We never allow them to leave safely. Your goal isn’t to crush them all, it’s to come back alive!”

“Come back alive?” Yang Ye frowned, “My life will be in danger?”

The middle aged man suddenly waved his hand. In an instant, a screen of water appeared before Yang Ye, and there was a young corpse in it.

The middle aged man asked, “Do you know who this is?”

Yang Ye shook his head.

The middle aged man explained, “A genius from the Weapon Path. He was too confident in himself upon coming here, and he challenged Sixth Senior Brother. This is the outcome of that!”

Yang Ye was stunned speechless.

The middle aged man continued, “It’s a form of competition between the four paths too. However, when compared to the other races, our method is comparatively harmonious. However, it still may end in death. Once you go there, experts at the Progenitor Realm will not act against you. However, all Sages below the Progenitor Realm can attack you.”

“Then what’s the point of going?!” Yang Ye hurriedly said, “Isn’t it no different than courting death?”

The middle aged man smiled, “They can act against you, but they won’t rashly do so. After all, they still have to maintain their honor. At the very most, they’ll let the younger generation spar with you. The main reason that genius from the Weapon Path died here was that he courted death. Of course, your trip doesn’t just come with danger, it comes with benefits too.”

Yang Ye asked, “What benefits?”

The middle aged man smiled, “If you can return, you can go to our Dao Path’s sacred grounds. The experiences accumulated by countless experts of our Dao Path are there, and there are some analyses of the techniques belonging to the other races and the four paths. In short, you’ll like that place.”

Yang Ye spoke solemnly, “What if I refuse to go?”

The middle aged man fell silent for a long time before he said, “It’s best if you do go. You need to prove yourself. Only then will many people in our Dao Path truly acknowledge you.”

Yang Ye said, “What about the Sage Alliance?”

The middle aged man said, “As soon as you set out from the Dao Path, the Sage Alliance won’t come for you anymore, and the other races won’t dare to openly attack and kill you too.”

Yang Ye smiled, “Looks like I must go.”

The middle aged man said, “Go now.” Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Yang Ye spoke in a low voice, “So can I go to the dimensions of any one of the races now, and they…”

The middle aged man interrupted Yang Ye and said, “I know what you’re trying to say. You must realize that while the Dao Path doesn’t support slaughter, it doesn’t represent that the Dao Path won’t slaughter. You can return to the Human Dimension or Sky Dimension at any time. Both the Sovereign of Man and the Sovereign of Sky won’t act against you. At the very least, they won’t do so openly.”

Yang Ye didn’t say anything else and just left.

Once Yang Ye left, an old man suddenly appeared by the middle aged man’s side.

The middle aged man asked, “Second Senior Brother, what do you think?”

The old man shook his head slightly, “His natural talent is naturally extraordinary, and I have nothing to say about his strength. However, his Dao doesn’t conform to the Dao of our Dao Path.”

The middle aged man replied, “I know. But why did Master choose him then?”

The old man’s eyes narrowed slightly, “Who knows what Master is thinking?”

A short moment of silence ensued, and then the middle aged man said, “Do you think he’ll come back alive?”

The old man remained silent.

…

Yang Ye arrived high above in the clouds. He sat on a cloud and looked silently into the distance.

Suddenly, a voice resounded in Yang Ye’s ears, “Are you feeling like you’re always within the schemes of those so-called great figures? Are you feeling like no matter how strong you become, you still have to rely on others to survive?”

Yang Ye looked over, and he saw a man standing there, a man without arms.
