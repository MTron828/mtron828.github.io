Chapter 650 – Reverse!

A woman appeared in front of Unseeing. She was around the age of 20, with silver hair, a linen dress, bare feet, and pitch black eyes. Moreover, even her pupils were pitch black and deep like the night sky. A silver chain was coiled around the woman’s wrist. However, it didn’t really seem like it was coiled around her wrist but was restraining her instead.

Because the chain started from her arms and covered her entire body!

Nether Maiden gazed at Yang Ye. Her eyes seemed as if they carried an unusual charm that caused Yang Ye to be dazed, and this made him feel even more astounded. He hurriedly circulated his Sword Intent to expel the discomfort he felt, and then his figure flashed over 30m back to widen to distance between him and her!

An Nanjing walked over to Yang Ye’s side, and an unprecedentedly solemn expression could be seen on her face!

“Another genius in the Sword Dao has appeared after the Sword Sect’s Founding Ancestor. She isn’t bad as well. She has combined numerous Intents and possesses over 20 different inheritances in the Martial Dao. She’s a rare and peerless genius. Xiahou Xuan and the others shouldn’t die at your hands, and the two of you shouldn’t die at my hands as well. The true enemy of Profounder Continent is the defiant profounders. So, I won’t kill you today!” She spoke slowly, and her voice seemed to carry a strange power that made both Yang Ye and An Nanjing feel slightly dizzy.

“You’re really confident!” Yang Ye took a step forward as he activated his Sword Domain, and an invisible force enveloped the surroundings.

“There’s no one beneath the Half-Saint Realm that I can’t kill!” She stretched out her hand and grasped it lightly, and then an invisible force appeared around her and kept Yang Ye’s Sword Domain away.

Yang Ye’s pupils constricted. What is that? It’s actually able to keep the energy of my Domain away?

“Reverse!” She suddenly released her clenched fist, and then a ray of white light and black light flashed. After that, a muffled groan resounded from Yang Ye as he took over 10 steps back. His Sword Domain has been destroyed!

An Nanjing was about to attack yet Yang Ye appeared before her and took her hand before he shook his head.

This woman before them was too mysterious!

Nether Maiden said, “The Sword Domain shouldn’t be that weak. The Sword Sect’s Founding Ancestor relied on his Sword Domain to fight over a dozen Half-Saints on his own. It seems like you haven’t truly grasped the essence of the Sword Domain. Perhaps you’ll be able to fight me once you have!”

Yang Ye took a deep breath and said, “Go on and leave!” It wasn’t that he didn’t desire to kill them right here and now, but it was utterly impossible. Her strength felt unfathomable to him, and it was something he’d only felt from Elder Mu. However, she was only at the ninth rank of the Exalt Realm....

Unless he truly grasped the method of utilizing the Sword Domain or obtained the Sword Spirit’s main body, otherwise, he would definitely have a very slim chance of defeating that woman!

Nether Maiden nodded. She turned around, gazed at Unseeing, and then waved her hand slightly. A strand of white light shot into Unseeing’s stomach, and then the enormous gash there started healing at a visible speed, and only less than 10 breaths of time passed before his injury had healed completely as if it was never there!

Yang Ye’s expression changed slightly, and his gaze towards her grew even more solemn!

“What’re you doing here?” asked Unseeing.

She replied, “I came to save both of you. Unfortunately, I was a step too late. Xiahou Xuan is dead!”

Unseeing inquired, “How did he die?”

She pondered deeply for a moment and said, “A force that exceeds the scope of this world killed him. That force possessed energy that was superior to the energy of the Heaven Dao in this world, and it acknowledged Yang Ye. So, Xiahou Xuan suffered from backlash.”

“Energy that surpasses the energy of the Heaven Dao of this world exists?” Unseeing continued with a voice that carried shock.

“Yes, and there isn’t just a few of them....” She suddenly stretched out her hand and grabbed his shoulder, and then her figure shook slightly before she appeared 500km away....

“You should have been able to kill him just now. Why didn’t you?” asked Unseeing.

She replied, “I couldn’t.”

“Why?” He was puzzled by her answer.

She answered, “That Half-Saint of this continent had his eyes on me once I made an appearance there. I might be the one to have died if I attacked him!”

Unseeing asked, “Then why didn’t he kill you?”

“He wouldn’t dare because he’s afraid I’ll destroy his Dao....”

Unseeing was at a loss for words.

Elder Mu appeared in front of Yang Ye once Nether Maiden and Unseeing were gone. At this moment, there was a trace of seriousness on Elder Mu’s face. He gazed at the direction that Nether Maiden left towards and said, “She’s extremely mysterious. The energy and Dao she cultivates are those that even I’ve never seen. Even though she’s only at the Exalt Realm, I feel that she can pose a threat to me!”

Yang Ye’s pupils constricted, and he said, “She can pose a threat to you? Is she that strong?”

Elder Mu smiled and said, “It’s just a feeling. If we really fought, then even 10 of her wouldn’t be a match for me. There are 2 reasons why I didn’t kill her just now. Firstly, I don’t want to bully the weak. Secondly, I hope that you’ll do it yourself and not need me to do it for you. You need to grow, and you have to deal with your own enemies. All I can guarantee is that no one will bully you!”

Yang Ye nodded and said, “I understand. Don’t worry, Elder Mu. I’ll work hard.”

Elder Mu continued, “Your current strength is inferior to her. But you don’t have to feel dispirited. She’s quite mysterious and can’t be judged by convention. You have to work hard on stabilizing your current cultivation and tempering your Sword Intent. Even though you’re at the ninth rank of the Exalt Realm now, you obtained it through external assistance. So, there are some latent problems with it that you must eliminate. Otherwise, you’ll suffer from incessant problems in the future. It’s the same for you Sword Intent. You have to temper it incessantly and improve it!”

Yang Ye nodded and said, “Elder Mu, do you know about the Sword Domain?” Even though he’d comprehended it, he hadn’t truly grasped it, and that made him feel extremely depressed. Otherwise, it wouldn’t be impossible for him to kill Nether Maiden just now if he joined forces with An Nanjing.

Elder Mu shook his head and said, “The Sword Domain was something that only the Unfettered One comprehended all the years ago, so even I’m not aware of its secrets. Perhaps members of the Hallowed Grounds possess the answers you seek, but they’re bound to not tell you anything based on the relationship you have with them. So, you have to figure it out yourself. In any case, you’ve comprehended it, so it won’t be going anywhere!”

“Figure it out myself....” Yang Ye laughed bitterly.

Elder Mu spoke abruptly, “Chaotic times are upon us. The enemies before you are the Hallowed Grounds, the Heaven Dao, and it might even include the defiant profounders. You should be aware of the consequences you’ll face if you don’t possess sufficient strength. I’m not invincible in this world like how the Unfettered One was all those years ago. There are still forces that can kill me. So, if you want to live and live a good life, then you have to constantly strengthen yourself and use your sword to break through all obstructions!”

Yang Ye nodded. He was very well aware that his current enemies were much stronger than the Flower Palace and Origin School who were his enemies of the past. He had to possess formidable strength in order to survive. As for Elder Mu, he’d never thought about relying on Elder Mu forever. After all, one can only rely on one’s self. He understood that principle a very, very long time ago.

Elder Mu smiled, and then he gazed at An Nanjing and said, “Your natural talent is unprecedentedly rare. Your accomplishments may not necessarily be inferior to that woman if you were born in the Hallowed Grounds.”

“I won’t lose to her!” An Nanjing spoke flatly in a firm tone.

Elder Mu smiled as he gazed at her, and then he gazed at Yang Ye and said, “Cherish those in front of you!” He vanished once he finished speaking.

Yang Ye was slightly embarrassed by this.

The atmosphere between them was slightly embarrassing, and a short while passed before An Nanjing suddenly said, “You can let go now!”

Yang Ye was slightly stunned. He lowered his head to have a look, and only then did he realize that he still hadn’t let go of her hand....

Yang Ye didn’t let go and spoke instead, “Let me take you somewhere!” He brought her into the Primordial Pagoda.

As soon as she entered it, her reaction was the same as Su Qingshi and the others. She was shocked by the scene before her.

There was a luxurious palace standing before them. It was something Qin Xiyue had brought in from the Gran Qin Empire. Su Qingshi and the others usually cultivated within that palace.

“Where are we?” An Nanjing’s eyes were filled with bewilderment.

Yang Ye explained, “It’s a long story. In any case, all you have to know is that cultivating here is very much faster than cultivating in the outside world. So, you can cultivate here from now on. We can even have discussions to temper our cultivation and techniques when I’m free. What do you think?”

An Nanjing glanced at the surroundings before she said, “The energy here really is very abundant. It’s much more abundant than the outside world.”

“You’re willing to stay?” Yang Ye’s voice carried undisguised happiness.

She asked, “Do you want me to?”

“Of course!” he nodded. An Nanjing’s growth in strength was very beneficial to him and herself. Of course, he didn’t have any intentions of using her, and he just purely hoped that she could benefit from it.

She said, “I know you’re grateful, but this really isn’t necessary!”

Yang Ye’s brows knit together slightly, and then he tightened his grip on her hand and said, “An Nanjing, do you think I brought you here and revealed this secret of mine because I want to repay you?”

An Nanjing just gazed at him in silence, and it could be considered as silent approval.

Yang Ye took a deep breath, and then he released her hand and said, “You lost an arm to help me. It would be a lie if I said that I wasn’t grateful and guilty. However, I’ve never said sorry or thank you to you. Do you know why? It’s because I think that such words aren’t necessary between us. I firmly believe that you would still step forward and lend me a hand if I was in trouble, and I would do the same for you.”

An Nanjing lowered her head slightly and remained silent.

Yang Ye’s heart hurt a little as he gazed at her severed arm, and he hugged her lightly and said, “Let’s not talk about all of that. I respect your decision. You’re welcome to stay if you want, and I won’t stop you if you want to leave. All that matters is that you’re happy!” DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

An Nanjing didn’t know what to say.
