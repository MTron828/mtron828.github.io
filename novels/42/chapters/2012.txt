Chapter 2013 – Escalated!

“Brothers?” The middle aged man chuckled. He patted Yu Jing lightly on the shoulder, “As far as I’m concerned, brothers are there to be betrayed. I almost lost my life when a brother of mine betrayed me all those years ago. Kid, loyalty may exist, but it’s under the condition that there aren’t any sufficient benefits for betrayal. If the benefits are sufficient, then not to mention brothers, some would even be willing to kill their own father!”

Yu Jing smiled silently.

At this moment, he recalled that moment in the Dead Dimension. That young man who could have escaped on his own, but he’d traveled all the way back to Sky Residence City and led them through the ocean of demon beasts!

Why did the young man do that?

For benefits?

His own interests?

No! He’d done it because they were brothers!

Sometimes, being brothers was a joke in the face of benefits. However, there were many times when benefits were a joke in front of true brothers.

The middle aged man in front of Yu Jing nodded slightly, “I’ll help you, but the Sovereign of Sky will definitely notice what we’ve done. So, are you sure that you plan to shoulder the consequences?”

Yu Jing was about to speak when the middle aged man added, “While the Yu Clan’s patriarch isn’t a very high position, it’ll still give you a little bit of status and authority in the sky race.”

Yu Jing shrugged, “Isn’t it just a position? I don’t need it!”

Yu Jing turned around and swaggered off.

The middle aged man gazed at Yu Jing’s figure for a long time, and then a wisp of bitterness curled up on the corners of his mouth.

The competition within clans was extremely brutal. Once someone failed to seize the position of patriarch, the best outcome was being driven out of the clan. That was why he didn’t agree to Yu Jing’s request!

However, he knew his son’s temper very well. If he refused, his son would do it himself. At that time, the matter would escalate even further!

A long time passed before the middle aged man shook his head. He spoke softly, “Summon Elder Yin and Elder Gu!”

“Understood!” A voice resounded.

The middle aged man gazed at the arena. At this moment, Yang Ye was standing there with his sword in hand, and he seemed like a sharp sword waiting to leave its sheath.

The middle aged man’s eyes narrowed slightly, “He’s not ordinary indeed!”

Meanwhile, in the arena.

Yang Ye’s eyes were closed, and he ignored all the noise in the surroundings. Gu Cangyan was standing not too far away from Yang Ye. He hadn’t left because he wanted to watch how the sky race was trampled on.

At this moment, the entire Sky Dimension was filled with clamorous noise.

The news of a human challenging the younger generation of the entire sky race had spread like a plague, and it had spread throughout the Sky Dimension. So, more and more were rushing to Sky City. Moreover, some geniuses who lived in seclusion were rushing to Sky City too.

If no one in the sky race could defeat Yang Ye, then it would definitely be a humiliation for them.

So, more and more rushed to the city. Now, the area around the arena was completely packed with people, and many started to float in the air while some stayed outside the city.

Xiao Qi’s elder sister walked over to Yang Ye and said, “The entire sky race knows your name now!”

Yang Ye replied, “So what?”

She said, “Things have escalated, terribly. Regardless of whether someone can defeat you, it’s obvious you’ll never make it out of the Sky Dimension. Even that monkey won’t be able to save you now. The humiliation that the sky race suffered must be washed away with blood!”

Yang Ye spoke in a carefree manner, “Is that so?”

She wanted to say more, but Yang Ye waved his hand, “Don’t disturb me.”

Her face fell. She wanted to say more, but a woman in black clothes had suddenly appeared in front of Yang Ye.

Someone had come to challenge Yang Ye!

Countless spectators from the sky race cheered at the sight of this. They’d really been too aggrieved throughout this time, and someone had finally come now.

Yang Ye glanced at her. She was completely covered in black clothes, so only her figure could be seen.

Yang Ye withdrew his gaze, “Make you move!”

She suddenly asked, “A human?”

Yang Ye nodded.

The black clothed woman said, “I didn’t expect that after the King and two Emperors, the human race has another extraordinary genius!”

The two Emperors? Yang Ye frowned slightly, “You know Qin Chuan?”

Qin Chuan was one of the two Emperors!

The woman nodded slightly, “I met him once. He has grown much stronger after returning from the Dead Dimension. Presently, he can rank in the top three of the human race’s geniuses!”

Qin Chuan!

Yang Ye chuckled. He hadn’t forgotten that fellow, and he knew that Qin Chuan’s strength was enough for Qin Chuan to do very well in the Human Dimension.

I should go pay him a visit!

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts and gazed at the woman, “Make your move!”

She nodded slightly, “Alright!”

As soon as she finished speaking, a dagger appeared in her grasp, and then she transformed into numerous afterimages that vanished on the spot. An instant later, a ray of cold light flashed by Yang Ye’s throat.

Hiss!

The sound of space being sliced open resounded.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye had moved over 30m back. He touched his throat and glanced at his fingers. There was an obvious smear of blood on it.

He was bleeding!

Countless people from the sky race cheered from the sight of this, and they were almost going mad with excitement.

Shouts, curses, cheers, and so on and so forth resounded from the surroundings.

Yang Ye grinned as he gazed at the drop of blood on his finger, and then he looked up at her, “You’re really fast!”

“I can be faster!” As soon as she finished speaking, a blade had arrived before Yang Ye. This happened too quickly to the point that the spectators couldn’t react to it at all. But this time, her dagger stopped when it was around 10 cm away from Yang Ye’s throat.

Because a sword was pressed against her throat.

The surroundings fell silent at the sight of this.

A moment of silence ensued, and then she lowered her dagger and said, “I’ve lost!”

Lost!

The surroundings fell deathly silent!

Yang Ye lowered his sword and said, “You have to be even faster!”

Her speed was extremely fast, but Yang Ye was never weak when it came to speed. Actually, she could still fight him because his attack would have never been able to take her life just now. However, once her speed was suppressed, she lost her confidence and admitted defeat!

Yang Ye glanced at the crowd and said, “Next!”

Next!

Countless people gazed at Yang Ye. If their gazes could kill, then Yang Ye would have been obliterated by now.

A human was humiliating the sky race, but the sky race’s younger generation couldn’t stop him at all! If news of this spread… No, actually, the news of Yang Ye challenging the entire sky race’s younger generation on his own had spread to all the races.

At this moment, it wasn’t just the sky race that remembered Yang Ye’s name, all the other races did so too.

In the arena, the woman cupped her fist to Yang Ye and left. Meanwhile, Xiao Qi’s elder sister appeared in front of Yang Ye. She looked him in the eyes for a long time and asked, “How long are you going to continue this challenge?”

“When?” Yang Ye smiled, “Don’t worry, it’ll end very soon. A day from now, I’ll leave if no one comes to challenge me. Alright?”

Her face grew even gloomier when she heard Yang Ye.

Yang Ye had given a time limit. So, if no one from the sky race challenged him or no one could defeat him within that time limit, then the sky race would be utterly humiliated.

Yang Ye’s plan was extremely ruthless!

She gazed at Yang Ye for a long time before leaving.

The crowd was agitated too, and countless shouts and curses resounded incessantly.

Suddenly, Yang Ye stomped his right foot down.

Boom!

The entire arena shook violently, and the surroundings instantly fell silent while all of them looked up at Yang Ye.

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings, “Stop cursing. Come fight me if you don’t like it. Don’t just stay down there and make noise.”

“You think I’m afraid?!” Suddenly, a young man shot up into the air and charged at Yang Ye.

Bang!

However, the spectators hadn’t even been able to react before he was blasted away, and he flew over 10km away.

Yang Ye lowered his fist, “Continue!”

Countless people glared angrily at Yang Ye.

It was aggrieving!

That was what all of them felt right now. They felt extremely aggrieved.

Just like that, time trickled by. Six hours later, Yu Jing suddenly appeared in the arena. Yang Ye was about to say something when Yu Jing grabbed Yang Ye’s right shoulder, “Come with me! Don’t ask anything!”

As soon as he finished speaking, they vanished from the arena. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

In a boundless mountain range outside Sky City, two rays of light descended in a forest.

It was Yang Ye and Yu Jing.

Yang Ye gazed at Yu Jing, “What?”

Yu Jing looked ahead. A shadowy figure walked out from there, and Yang Ye’s expression became solemn at the sight of the figure.

It was a Zen Realm expert!

Meanwhile, the figure waved his right hand, and a petite figure appeared in front of Yang Ye.

Yang Ye was stunned.

It was Zi’er’s figure!

However, her eyes were closed, and she seemed to be in deep sleep.

Yang Ye suppressed the excitement he felt and asked, “She…”

“There’s something wrong with her soul, so she can’t wake up for now.” The black clothed figure continued, “I can only help you this much.”

Yang Ye took a deep breath and gazed at Yu Jing. The latter smiled, “It was nothing. There’s no need to thank me.”

“Leave!” Meanwhile, the black clothed figure said, “The Sovereign of Sky should have noticed this by now!”

Yang Ye nodded, “Take care!”

Yang Ye waved his right hand, teleported Zi’er into the Primordial Pagoda, and then a pair of wings appeared on his back before he vanished on the spot.

Meanwhile, Yu Jing took a deep breath. He fell silent for a long time before he looked behind him, “Second Uncle, let’s go!”

The black clothed figure replied, “It’s too late!”

Suddenly, a middle aged man appeared in front of them.

The middle aged man glanced at them, “Dammit!”

Bang!

As soon as he finished speaking, the space here exploded apart!
