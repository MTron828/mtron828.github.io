Chapter 2066 – Is a Sage That Great?

He liked killing!

Countless people revealed weird expressions when they heard Yang Ye.

The middle aged man, the man they called Instructor Li, gazed at Yang Ye for a long time and said, “This is Martial Emperor Academy.”

He felt that he should remind the young man that this was Martial Emperor Academy, and no one could cause trouble here. The reason he was reminding Yang Ye wasn’t that he was afraid of how powerful the power standing behind Yang Ye was, he just hated to see a genius lost like that!

Yang Ye’s natural talent was obviously extremely good, and his combat strength wasn’t bad at all. If he died here, it would be quite a pity.

Yang Ye smiled, ‘Senior, I know this is Martial Emperor Academy, but according to my knowledge, the academy doesn’t prohibit its students from fighting, right?”

Instructor Li reminded, “You’re not a student of my academy yet!”

Yang Ye looked Instructor Li in the eyes and said, “If the students of Martial Emperor Academy can’t even defeat a mere librarian, then is being a student of the academy anything worth being proud of? Or perhaps I should ask, what’s the point?”

Instructor Li sighed softly. It was exactly why he hadn’t tried to save the man who was kneeling there. If students of the great Martial Emperor Academy couldn’t even defeat a mere librarian, what was even the point of keeping such students?

He wasn’t being ruthless, nor was the academy ruthless. It was this world which was ruthless.

As for who was right or wrong, he didn’t care at all. At most times, very few people actually cared about that, and they only cared about who was strong. Obviously, Yang Ye was stronger right now!

Instructor Li glanced at Yang Ye and shook his head slightly, “Good luck!”

He vanished into the sky once he finished speaking.

Instructor Li was representing the academy, and his departure represented that the academy wouldn’t interfere in this anymore.

Everyone here gazed at Yang Ye who was seated behind the stone table. Obviously, it was impossible to end this matter amicably anymore.

Sure enough, it didn’t take long for a middle aged man to appear outside the library. As soon as he arrived, the man kneeling on the ground started shouting, “Uncle Feng, save me! Save me!”

The middle aged man glanced at the kneeling young man, and then he gazed at Yang Ye. However, Yang Ye ignored the middle aged man and patted Tian Xiu gently on the head, “Go inside and play with Snowy, alright?”

Tian Xiu glanced at the middle aged man and spoke softly, “Big Brother, be careful!”

Yang Ye smiled, “I will!” He transported her into the Primordial Pagoda once he finished speaking.

Yang Ye stood up, walked over to the middle aged man, and the latter looked him in the eyes, “Let him go!”

Yang Ye smiled, “You must be dreaming!”

The middle aged man suddenly stretched out a hand and twisted it lightly. In an instant, the space around Yang Ye turned into a pitch black vortex, and Yang Ye seemed like he was about to be minced into bits. At this moment, Yang Ye too felt like his body was being pulled apart by a million horses!

Suddenly, a few dozen swords surged out from Yang Ye, and then the vortex around him was sliced into bits. A moment later, a ray of light arrived before the middle aged man’s forehead.

However, the middle aged man was 300m away.

The middle aged man sized up Yang Ye, “You have some skill!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he tapped his finger in Yang Ye’s direction.

Bang!

Everyone here watched with bewilderment as Yang Ye’s figure was blasted away and slammed against the library’s wall.

A cold smile curled up on the middle aged man’s face, but it didn’t take long for it to stiffen. It was because Yang Ye had stood up and started walking slowly in his direction. It was obvious that Yang Ye was fine!

At this moment, a trace of seriousness had appeared in the middle aged man’s eyes.

Yang Ye raised his palm, and a sword appeared on it. The tip of his sword started to spin against his palm. In an instant, rays of light flashed out from the sword. At this moment, Yang Ye was surrounded by rays of light.

The middle aged man’s eyes narrowed slightly, and then he pressed his palms together and shook them slightly.

“Go!” Suddenly, Yang Ye’s voice resounded, and then his sword transformed into a ray of light that shot towards the middle aged man. The powerful sword energy contained within the sword caused the spectators to move backwards repeatedly.

It was too strong to the point of being capable of hurting them!

The middle aged man suddenly slammed his palms forward.

Bang!

A wave of terrifying energy swept out from his palms and stopped Yang Ye’s sword energy, causing it to be unable to move an inch further! ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Suddenly, a huge ethereal sword emerged from within Yang Ye, and it merged into one with Yang Ye’s entire body. At the same time, another pitch black sword appeared in Yang Ye’s grasp.

“Sword Fusion!” Suddenly, someone exclaimed with shock.

The middle aged man’s expression had changed from the sight of this as well. At the same time, Yang Ye’s figure vanished on the spot.

The middle aged man was shocked, and then another sword appeared before him. A pitch black sword.

The pitch black sword was clamped between the middle aged man’s palms. In an instant, the terrifying aura he emanated vanished without a trace, and then Yang Ye’s pitch black sword stabbed into his chest.

Bang!

The middle aged man was blasted away, and he was blasted out of the mountain. The middle aged man’s figure crashed down from the mountain peak. While his figure was still in midair, the sword in his chest transformed into a ray of black light that returned to Yang Ye’s grasp.

As for the middle aged man, there were no signs of life left in him when he crashed to the ground!

The surroundings were absolutely silent.

Everyone was looking at Yang Ye while feeling curious about his identity. Who is he?

Yang Ye lowered his sword and walked slowly towards the man kneeling on the ground. He glanced at him and said, “Come on, let me see how powerful your backing is. Let me see why you were so fearless earlier!”

The man stared at Yang Ye yet didn’t dare to say a word. At this moment, he was very well aware that he’d bitten off more than he could chew.

Yang Ye didn’t waste his breath on the man and just went back to the stone table and sat down. There were two swords on the table, a pitch black sword and a crimson gold one.

Yang Ye glanced at the crowd and said, “If you want to read or borrow something, you can.”

All of them remained silent.

When he saw no one respond, he asked, “Is there no one here who wants to read or book anything?”

“Of course there is!” Suddenly, a voice resounded. Everyone looked towards its source, and they saw a woman in white clothes walking slowly in their direction. She had a white umbrella in her grasp.

The woman walked slowly in Yang Ye’s direction, and then she paced a violet card on the table.

Yang Ye asked, “Which level?”

“Three!” She looked him in the eyes, “An hour!”

Yang Ye nodded. He took her card and swiped it gently against the black scroll, and then a translucent key appeared before the woman.

It was the key to the 3rd level!

She took it and started walking forward. Right when she was about to vanish from Yang Ye’s view, she suddenly stopped and gazed at him, “Are you interested in entering the Sky Class?”

“The Sky Class!” Some exclaimed in the crowd, and then everyone gazed at her.

The Sky Class!

Martial Emperor Academy had the Sky Class, Earth Class, Spirit Class, and Mortal Class. The Sky Class was the most mysterious among them, and it was the most terrifying too. It could be said that anyone in that class was a true extraordinary genius, and such a genius was comparable to the top geniuses of the four paths.

The Sky Class was a place that every student in the academy yearned to join, and it was the place they worked hard to join.

They hadn’t expected to actually see a student from the Sky Class here.

They were excited!

Of course, they felt even more envy. Because a student of the Sky Class had actually invited that librarian to join the Sky Class.

They had to admit that the librarian was quite capable, but joining the Sky Class? Was he even strong enough?

That was what many people thought. But they didn’t dare to say it out loud.

Yang Ye was quite surprised as well. He hadn’t expected her to be from the Sky Class. He’d merely heard of it from Li Shui’shui.

Join the Sky Class? Yang Ye thought for a moment and said, “Isn’t it a class that only students of Martial Emperor Academy can join?”

She flicked a black card over to Yang Ye, “That’s a recommendation letter. You can take it to the 7th peak of the academy, Avaricious Wolf Mountain, and see Elder Mo. Pass the test and you’ll be able to join the Sky Class. Good luck!”

She vanished once she finished speaking.

Avaricious Wolf Mountain? Yang Ye thought for a moment and put the card away. Since he had a chance to join the academy, he would naturally not abandon it.

Suddenly, Yang Ye looked towards the side. An old man was walking slowly in his direction, and the old man stopped before the entrance.

Meanwhile, the young man kneeling on the ground howled, “Ancestor! Ancestor! Save me!”

The old man glanced at him, “What an embarrassment!”

He waved his hand once he finished speaking.

Bang!

The man exploded apart and was obliterated on the spot.

The old man gazed at Yang Ye, “I have to consider his death as your fault. You don’t have any objections, right?”

Yang Ye stood up and looked the old man in the eyes, “Is being a Sage that great?”

A Sage!

Everyone here was shocked, and they gazed at the old man. None of them had expected the old man to actually be a Sage!
