Chapter 190 – Diverting Trouble

Yang Ye gazed at Yang Feng and said, “Needless to say, you’re very smart and sensible....” When he spoke up to here, a cold glow flashed in Yang Ye’s eyes as he said, “But it’s exactly because of this that I should kill you. Because a person like you might suddenly jump out and take a bite at me in the future!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye didn’t waste his breath anymore, and his figure flashed towards Yang Feng....

Yang Feng seemed to have been on guard since the beginning, and his figure shot explosively backward when Yang Ye had just arrived in front of him. At the same time, he instantly tossed a high-grade mid-rank Fire Technique Talisman towards Yang Ye.

Yang Ye drew his sword and slashed, and the dense flames that erupted from the talisman were instantly dispersed. On the other hand, Yang Feng was already over 30m away.

Yang Ye glanced at the violet mink, and it understood him. With a wave of its little claw, a strand of violet light instantly appeared in front of Yang Feng who was fleeing madly. Yang Feng was astounded and caught off guard, so he was utterly unable to stop himself, and it was like he’d moved forward to knock into the violet light on his own....

Bang!

Yang Feng collided with the violet light, and his figure was blasted backward at a speed that was even swifter than when he was fleeing....

On the other hand, Yang Ye arrived before Yang Feng at this moment, and then he drew his sword and slashed....

Yang Feng’s head was already flying in the air before he could even react....

Yang Ye shook his head as he gazed at Yang Feng’s eyes which were still opened wide. Needless to say, this fellow was very smart, but his intelligence was his downfall. Because his intelligence was an even greater reason for why Yang Ye had to kill him. After all, it was best to have lesser trouble, or perhaps it should be said that it’s best if one encountered no trouble at all!

Yang Ye stretched out his hand and gestured, and the spatial ring on Yang Feng’s hand flew into his palm. When he took a glance at the contents of the ring, Yang Ye laughed coldly as he said to himself, It’s a good thing I made a move against him. There are actually three more King Rank Inner Cores within this ring!

Coupled with the three he obtained earlier, he had seven in his possession now....

As expected, robbing humans is much easier than robbing Darkbeasts. No wonder Qing Xiyue said that my greatest enemy when participating in the Ascension Rankings wouldn’t be Darkbeasts but humans....

After he put the spatial ring away, Yang Ye was about to flash towards the south. However, right at this moment, three figures were flashing over from afar. This group of three was made up of two men and a woman. At this moment, the three of them were dashing madly towards the gorge on Yang Ye’s right. In next to no time, Yang Ye disregarded them and looked behind them because there were four King Rank Darkbeasts that were the size of tiny hills running behind them!

Yang Ye’s eyelids twitched when he saw these four King Rank Darkbeasts. Because they were actually Shadowhunter Leopards. The strength of such Darkbeasts was inferior to strength type Darkbeasts like the Flameroar Lions, Earth Bear King, and Sawtooth Tiger. However, its speed and explosive power were much stronger than the three examples from before.

At this moment, Yang Ye was very curious about why these three people were able to flee before Shadowhunter Leopards that were renowned for their speed in the Grand Myriad Mountains. In next to no time, Yang Ye came to an understanding because he saw the glow of talismans on them. In other words, the three of them had utilized Strider Talismans, and the quality of these talismans wasn’t low as well!

At this moment, the three of them had seen Yang Ye as well. The eyes of the blue robed man who led the group flickered, and then he sped up and rushed towards Yang Ye. The other two behind him hesitated for a moment before they ran swiftly towards Yang Ye as well.

The woman by the blue robed young man asked abruptly. “Cousin Brother, he might be a disciple of the Sword Sect. Is this really a good choice?”

Even though the Sword Sect had fallen into decline, it was one of the six great powers in the end, and it wasn’t an existence that clans like theirs could offend.

The other young man said, “Cousin Brother, why don’t we join forces with him to resist these four King Rank Darkbeasts?”

The blue robed young man grunted coldly and said, “Worthless softheartedness. It’s exactly because he’s a disciple of the Sword Sect that we should draw them towards him. Because he would definitely be able to withstand those four animals for some time. Only with him drawing their attention would we have a chance at survival. Otherwise, would we be able to resist these four animals? As for joining forces, do you think the four of us can go against these four animals?”

The woman hesitated for a moment, and then she sighed lightly in the end and didn’t say anything. The other young man didn’t say anything as well. They were all disciples form one of the four great clans in the Imperial Capital, the Li Clan. After they entered Ascension Mountain Range, they’d utilized a secret technique of their clans to find each other. Their group of three had killed a few King Rank Darkbeasts all along the way. However, they’d never expected that the Darkbeasts had formed groups as well....

If the three of them joined forces against a single King Rank Darkbeast, then the Darkbeast would definitely not be a match for them. But if it was three against three....

A wisp of cold smile arose on the corners of Yang Ye’s mouth when he noticed their actions. Why are there so many people in this world that court death?

If he didn’t have the violet mink by his side, then he would really be unable to go against these four King Rank Darkbeasts. But with the little fellow by his side, it wouldn’t be a problem even if a whole group arrived before him.... He’d originally intended to be benevolent and rescue these three fellows, yet now....

In next to no time, the three of them arrived in front of Yang Ye. The blue robed young man who led the group glanced at Yang Ye, and a wisp of bewilderment flashed in his eyes when he saw Yang Ye’s expression was calm and without even a tinge of fear. However, he didn’t think too much about it, and he sped up and ran forward instead, whereas, the woman and young man behind him hesitated for a moment before they swiftly followed behind the blue robed young man....

Even though doing this was slightly cruel, it was better than dying.... Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

However, the situation didn’t develop according to how they’d planned. When they passed around Yang Ye, the four Shadowhunter Leopards behind them didn’t look for trouble with Yang Ye, and these Darkbeasts pursued them madly instead....

The three of them were astounded. They were originally able to maintain a certain distance with the four King Rank Darkbeasts because of the Strider Talismans they’d utilized. Yet now, these Darkbeasts had suddenly sped up....

The three of them had no other choice but to stop and battle these four King Rank Darkbeasts!

The reason these Darkbeasts had suddenly sped up was naturally because of the little fellow. The violet mink was already able to terrify King Rank Darkbeasts before it entered into the King Rank, and now that it had, ordinary King Rank Darkbeasts were simply obedient like sheep before it.

Under the influence of the little fellow, how could those four Darkbeasts dare to not dash forward desperately?

As he gazed at the three of them who were in an intense battle with the four Darkbeasts, Yang Ye was slightly surprised by their strengths. Obviously, they weren’t ordinary independent cultivators. Otherwise, they would be utterly unable to enter into an intense battle with these four Darkbeasts. Their strengths were even on par with some disciples of the Sword Sect.

At this moment, their minds were filled with questions as they couldn’t figure out why this had happened. In next to no time, the blue robed young man seemed to have thought of something, and he turned around and looked towards Yang Ye. When he saw Yang Ye looking indifferently at him, he suddenly understood something and immediately spoke loudly. “Are you a disciple of the Sword Sect? I’m the Young Master of the Li Clan, Li Qingfeng. My Li Clan has some ties with the Sword Sect. Please lend us a hand....”

He didn’t know why these four Darkbeasts didn’t attack the young man who held a sword, nor did he know why these Darkbeasts had suddenly sped up and seemed as if they wouldn’t stop before killing his group. All he knew was that all of this was definitely related to that young man who held a sword, so he didn’t hesitate to ask for help.

Yang Ye chuckled when he heard the blue robed young man. There’s actually such a shameless person in the world! He didn’t think about whether his clan had ties with the Sword Sect when he drew those Darkbeasts towards me!

Of course, he wasn’t interested even if this fellow’s clan really had ties with the Sword Sect because he was just delivering retribution....

When they saw Yang Ye remain indifferent, the three of them became anxious. The blue robed young man hurriedly said, “We shouldn’t have done that just now. I hope Brother can be magnanimous. So long as Brother is willing to lend us a hand, then we’ll definitely reward you generously, and my Li Clan will definitely reward you generously as well!”

Yang Ye shook his head. Does this fellow really take me to be an idiot? Once the three of them are dead, wouldn’t their possession be mine in the end? Why would I need a generous reward?

As for the generous reward of their clan. Truthfully speaking, he didn’t care. With his current standards, Dark Treasures and combat techniques had to be at the Earth Rank at least in order for him to value them!

Would the damnable Li Clan even give him an Earth Rank treasure or technique as an expression of their gratitude?

Before long, they were steadily losing ground. However, right when they were about to be killed by these four Darkbeasts, a group of over 10 people suddenly flashed over from afar.

The three of them heaved sighs of relief when they saw this group rush over abruptly.

On the other hand, Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed while he tightened his grip on his sword....
