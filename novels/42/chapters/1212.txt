Chapter 1213 – Here For Yang Ye’s Head!

Jian Xu brought Yang Ye to a bamboo forest. An expanse of tens of thousands of kilometers in the distance were filled with bamboo that were over 100m tall.

The bamboo forest instantly started to move like a wave when wind blew against it, and it seemed like a wavy ocean of bamboo.

“This place is absolutely remote and secluded!” Yang Ye spoke softly as he gazed at the ocean of bamboo. At this moment, they were in the depths of a few intersecting mountain ranges, and this bamboo forest was surrounded by mountains that towered into the clouds. If one didn’t scan the area intentionally while flying in the sky, it would be utterly impossible to notice the bamboo ocean.

“How else would one live in seclusion from the world?” Jian Xu grinned and said, “Let’s head in!”

Yang Ye asked, “We aren’t flying in?”

Jian Xu smiled, “You’ve failed to see properly this time. Look properly!”

Yang Ye was stunned. He turned around and gazed at the bamboo ocean. A short while passed before he frowned, “Sword intent is hidden within the bamboo. It’s a sword formation?”

Jian Xu nodded, “This ocean of bamboo that covers this area of tens of thousands of kilometers is actually a sword formation. An Emperor once tried to get through by force and was instantly minced into bits. Of course, you have no need to fear it. But we aren’t here to cause trouble.”

Yang Ye smiled, “Of course!”

Just like that, both of them started walking along a gravel path towards the depths of the bamboo forest.

Yang Ye was sizing up the surroundings incessantly. In the beginning, he hadn’t paid much attention to it, but now that he’d started to observe it carefully, he noticed that every single bamboo here was like a sword. Moreover, the leaves on the bamboo had actually started to spin once they stepped into the bamboo forest. Countless leaves were spinning and caused rustling to resound throughout the surroundings.

Yang Ye said, “It doesn’t seem quite friendly to us!”

Jian Xu replied, “It’s fine, that’s pretty normal. The formation will be automatically activated once someone enters it. It won’t attack us if we don’t attack or act rashly.”

Yang Ye asked, “Are you sure?”

Jian Xu nodded, “Of course, I’m come twice.”

Suddenly, one of the bamboo stalks not too far away from them had started to spin. A moment later, its leaves suddenly transformed into rays of light that shot towards Yang Ye and Jian Xu.

Jian Xu’s face froze.

Yang Ye pressed his index and middle fingers together before tapping them forward. The rays of light instantly dispersed while a few dozen leaves appeared in front of Yang Ye. Yang Ye grabbed them, but Jian Xu suddenly stopped him when he was about to launch an attack. Jian Xu said, “That should have been an accident!”

Yang Ye glanced at Jian Xu and replied, “I hope so!”

Jian Xu nodded, “Let’s walk faster!”

They had just started walking again when all the bamboo around them had started to spin on the spot. Moreover, numerous stalks of bamboo had suddenly appeared ahead of them on the gravel path. Jian Xu’s face became slightly unsightly at the sight of this. After all, it was like a slap to his face!

Yang Ye asked Jian Xu, “Am I not welcome here, or are you?”

Jian Xu hesitated for a moment and said, “I’m not very sure as well.”

Yang Ye asked, “How’s your relationship with that person?”

Jian Xu replied, “Not very good!”

Yang Ye’s face darkened. He’d thought that Jian Xu was friends with that number one sword formation master, but this fellow actually told him that they didn’t have a very good relationship....

Yang Ye shook his head and said, “Let me break through this formation first!”

“What high-sounding sentiments!” Suddenly, the dense bamboo forest split apart, and then a woman with a green sword appeared within their fields of vision. The woman had a graceful figure and a pretty appearance, but her eyes were icy cold, and it gave others the feeling that they should keep away.

Yang Ye was stunned when he saw her, and then he spoke with astonishment, “Zhuyao? What... what are you doing here?”

The woman’s beautiful brows were pressed together slightly, “You know my older sister?”

“Your older sister?” Yang Ye was stunned, “You’re not Zhuyao?”

She frowned, “Answer me!”

Yang Ye was stunned, and then he said, “I do know her. She’s with me right now!”

“With you?” The woman’s eyes narrowed slightly, “A mere Saint? How could my older sister possibly take a liking to you!?”

Yang Ye’s face stiffened. Meanwhile, Jian Xu said, “He means that she’s a subordinate of his. Alright. Little girl, we’re here to see your master. Go report our arrival.”

The woman spoke coldly, “Is my master someone you can meet just because you want to?”

Jian Xu intended to say something, but Yang Ye suddenly said, “Senior Jian Xu, let’s just use my way.” As he spoke, Yang Ye took a step forward. In an instant, a strand of terrifying sword intent suddenly appeared in the surroundings.

As soon as it did it appear, the woman’s expression changed drastically. She moved backwards repeatedly and only stopped after moving around 1km back. As for the bamboo ocean in the surroundings, they started trembling at this moment, and numerous sword howls resounded incessantly from them.

They were shivering!

The woman gazed at Yang Ye with astonishment and wasn’t able to speak coherently, “You.... You....”

Yang Ye paid no attention to her. He just looked towards the depth of the ocean of bamboos, “Senior, if you wanted to probe me, then I presume you’ve achieved your goal. So I wonder if you’re willing to meet?”

Meanwhile, Jian Xu said, “Jian Ji, we’ve already acknowledged Yang Ye as the current palace master of our Sword God’s Palace. Are you refusing to meet even the palace master of the Sword God’s Palace?”

A moment of silence ensued before a voice suddenly resounded from afar, “The palace master? How laughable! He dares to call himself the palace master without the Sword God’s Seal? Jian Xu, I’ve told you before. I acknowledge the seal and nothing else. You want me to help? Sure? Bring the Sword God’s Seal!”

Jian Xu’s face fell. He was about to speak when Yang Ye waved his hand and said, “Senior Jian Xu, don’t say anything else. Let’s just leave!”

“You....” Jian Xu gazed at Yang Ye with astonishment because he hadn’t expected Yang Ye to give up so quickly.

Yang Ye glanced towards the depths of the bamboo forest and said, “I have no need for such stubborn old fellows.”

“How dare you insult my master!” Meanwhile, the woman suddenly shouted with fury. However, she’d only just finished speaking when Yang Ye suddenly appeared before her. After that, a sword was pressed against the center of her forehead.

Yang Ye gazed at the woman who had astonishment covering her face, “A temper is something you can have, But it should be established on the foundation of sufficient strength. If you don’t have sufficient strength, then it’s best to keep your temper in check.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye’s figure flashed and returned to where he stood earlier. After that, he gazed at Jian Xu and said, “Let’s go!”

“You think you can come and go as you please? It isn’t that easy!” Meanwhile, a furious shout resounded from the depths of the bamboo ocean, and then all the bamboo around Yang Ye and Jian Xu started to spin. After that, the leaves on them transformed into rays of light that shot towards Yang Ye and Jian Xu. Jian Xu revealed a slightly solemn expression at the sight of this.

Because he noticed that the leaves had actually overlapped on each other once they arrived before him and Yang Ye. Once they overlapped, the rays of light overlapped as well. At this moment, every single ray of light in front of him and Yang Ye were a product of at least 1,000 of the previous rays of light that were overlapped together!

Jian Xu placed his hand on the sword that hung on his waist, and he was about to attack. However, Yang Ye took a step forward. As soon as he did that, a strand of sword intent appeared out of thin air, and then a shocking scene occurred around them. The rays of light around them actually stopped, and then they dispersed before the leaves fell to the ground.

Rebirth Realm sword intent!

Absolute suppression!

Swish!

Suddenly, a sharp sword howl resounded from the depths of the bamboo ocean. In next to no time, a ray of light shot out from there, and it arrived before Yang Ye in an instant. However, Yang Ye didn’t dodge and just allowed it to strike him.

The woman watched with astonishment as it shot into Yang Ye’s body, and then.... Nothing happened! It was like the ray of light had never been there.

Jian Xu said, “Jian Ji, don’t waste your strength. His sword intent is above the Void Rank. Unless your sword intent surpasses the void rank as well or you don’t use a sword against him, otherwise he’s practically invincible before you.”

Meanwhile, an old man in blue robes walked out from the depths of the bamboo forest. The woman hurriedly went over to greet the old man, “Master.”

The old man nodded slightly, and then he gazed at Yang Ye, “I never expected that after the founding ancestor, another sword cultivator with sword intent above the Void Rank has appeared on the continent.”

Yang Ye said, “So what if I possess sword intent above the Void Rank? Sword cultivation is waning, and no sword cultivator dares to step foot into the ruins of the Sword God’s Palace. That’s a disgrace of both the Sword God’s Palace and all sword cultivators. I, Yang Ye, am ashamed to face Senior Jian Wuji!”

The old man pondered deeply for a short moment and said, “It’s not your fault.”

“It is my fault!” Yang Ye suddenly became agitated, “It’s because I’m too weak, and my reputation is insufficient. I’m unable to summon all the living survivors of the Sword God’s Palace. Otherwise, we sword cultivators would definitely be able to rebuild the glory from all those years ago!”

Jian Xu couldn’t help but persuade Yang Ye, “It really isn’t your fault!”

“No, it’s my fault!” Yang Ye clenched his fists and said, “If I....”

“Alright! Alright!” Meanwhile, the old man suddenly interrupted Yang Ye and said, “Stop trying to play such tricks with me. I just want to know why you’re gathering all of us. Even though I suspect that you want to use us, I have to say that your goals are in line with ours. Moreover, you really only are the only one capable of reviving the path of sword cultivation on the continent.”

“No, not at all!” Yang Ye hurriedly spoke humbly, “I need the full support of all of you seniors in order to revive the path of sword cultivation on the continent. My strength isn’t sufficient to accomplish that!”

The old man looked Yang Ye in the eyes and said, “I can follow you, but I have a condition!”

Yang Ye spoke seriously, “Go on!”

The old man spoke seriously, “Get back the Sword God’s Seal! It’s the symbol of our Sword God’s Palace, and it must be reclaimed. I know that it’s very difficult, but I believe that the day you’re able to head to the ruins of the Sword God’s Palace will definitely come!”

“No problem!” Yang Ye answered without the slightest hesitation. He was definitely going to the ruins of the Sword God’s Palace. Because the Stellar Sword Diagram might be there.

The old man nodded and said, “Then let’s go set up a sword formation at Doomsday City first!”

A smile curled up on the corners of Yang Ye’s mouth, “Perfect!” ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

The 4 of them transformed into rays of light that vanished into the sky.

...

Doomsday City.

The sun was setting in the west, and the sky was growing darker.

Outside Doomsday City. A man with hair that hung down to his waist was holding a bloody head as he walked slowly towards Doomsday City.

A cultivator from the Sword Alliance shouted from atop the city walls, “Stop right there!”

The long haired man stopped, and then he tilted his head upwards to look up the city wall. A moment later, he tossed the head in his hand away, but just a moment passed before another head had appeared in his hand.

The head of that cultivator on the city wall was gone, and a pillar of blood was spraying like a fountain from his neck.

Everyone else in the surroundings was shocked!

The long haired man cracked a smile, “I... I’m called... the Head Snatcher. I’m here for Yang Ye’s... head....”
