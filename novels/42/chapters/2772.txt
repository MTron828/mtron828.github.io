Chapter 2773 – Self-Detonation!

Cang Mo’s expression turned extremely unsightly.

Destiny!

The Four Dimensional Universe was much more developed than the Three Dimensional Universe, and its overall strength was much, much stronger as well.

It could be said that besides the Three Dimensional Universe during Destiny’s time, the current Three Dimensional Universe couldn’t compete with the Four Dimensional Universe at all. Even during Destiny’s era, Destiny had been the only one in the Three Dimensional Universe who was capable of fighting the Four Dimensional Universe!

However, the Three Dimensional Universe had Destiny!

Just Destiny alone suppressed the entire Four Dimensional Universe!

A humiliation!

It was a humiliation for the entire Four Dimensional Universe!

However, they couldn’t do anything about it!

That woman was like a god, an unbeatable god!

Yang Ye’s words had undoubtedly struck him where it hurt!

Cang Mo didn’t waste his breath and just hurled his pike at Yang Ye.

Yang Ye suddenly vanished on the spot, and a ray of sword energy slashed against the pike.

Boom!

The pike shook violently, but it quickly calmed down. Because a hand had grabbed onto it.

Cang Mo was behind the pike!

Cang Mo shook the pike, shattering the sword energy on it. At the same time, he stabbed it forward.

Yang Ye suddenly released the Sword Precursor, and then Heavenshield appeared on his arms before he clamped down at the pike in front of him.

Bam!

Yang Ye’s figure shook violently, but he’d forcibly clamped down on the pike.

Cang Mo frowned slightly. He was about to attack when Yang Ye suddenly pressed forward and slammed himself at Cang Mo!

A mocking grin appeared on his face when he saw this. When had he ever feared someone in a clash of physical strength? So, he didn’t retreat and slammed himself at Yang Ye as well!

However, at the last moment, the Sword Gourd on Yang Ye’s waist shook slightly, and then a ray of light flashed!

Cang Mo’s expression changed drastically. He’d experienced the strength of that sword, but he couldn’t retreat anymore.

Cang Mo raised his right arm to defend himself!

He was defending himself with his hand!

Hiss!

Burial sliced off his arm with ease, and Yang Ye seized the opportunity to slam himself against Cang Mo!

Bang!

Cang Mo was instantly blasted away. Yang Ye was about to follow up with another attack, but a pike suddenly stabbed over from his right!

Yang Ye was forced to stop and swing his sword to the side!

Bang!

The pike was slashed away, but Cang Mo had retreated 3km away as well. He’d created a huge amount of distance between them.

Yang Ye shook his head and felt that it was quite a pity. He’d almost killed Cang Mo at that instant.

Unfortunately, that fellow had interfered!

Yang Ye looked over at Cang Mo, “So you didn’t plan to fight me in single combat! Oh, I understand. This is how the Four Dimensional Universe is. If you can’t win a one-on-one battle, you gang up on your opponent! Tsk, tsk. What an embarrassment, what an absolute embarrassment!”

Cang Mo’s face turned extremely gloomy. He glanced coldly at the expert who’d interfered earlier, and the latter lowered their head slightly, “Command Cang Mo, don’t forget our Master’s instructions!”

Cang Mo spoke fiercely, “Do I need you to teach me what to do?”

That expert hurriedly fell to one knee, “I dare not!”

Cang Mo glanced coldly at that expert. He hesitated for a moment, and then gave up his intention to continue the one-on-one battle. He was here with a mission.

Suddenly, Yang Ye pointed his sword at them, “Stop discussing it among yourselves! Come on! Just fight me together! While our Three Dimensional Universe doesn’t have many experts, we have backbone! Since I said I would fight you on my own, I’ll do just that. Even if you decide to gang up on me. It’s fine, I’ll fight all of you on my own. Even if I die, I will never bring shame to the Three Dimensional Universe!”

Cang Mo’s expression instantly turned extremely unsightly, and he glanced at the others by his side, “Don’t interfere again!”

One of them suddenly said, “Commander Cang Mo, he’s just goading you!”Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Cang Mo replied coldly, “Do you think I’m not aware?”

He walked toward Yang Ye while he spoke.

He wasn’t a fool, so he naturally knew what Yang Ye was up to. But he chose to fight Yang Ye in single combat!

The strong had their own backbone and honor!

Yang Ye was challenging him with a weaker cultivation. If he refused to accept the challenge, then even he would look down on himself.

He was fighting for honor!

Yang Ye glanced at the others behind Cang Mo and said, “I think you should just gang up on me.”

Cang Mo laughed coldly, “Is that even necessary against someone like you?”

He suddenly shot up into the air, and then a peerlessly powerful storm of energy gathered rapidly in the starry sky.

Yang Ye looked up and tightened his grip on his sword sheath.

Meanwhile, a pike carried strands of pitch black lightning as it shot down from above!

When it arrived around 30m away from his head, Yang Ye suddenly shot up into the air.

A sword howl cracked open the entire starry sky.

Boom!

A rumbling explosion resounded, and then countless arcs of lightning and sword energy shot toward the surroundings. Meanwhile, a ray of black sword energy flashed through space.

Along with that flash, the entire starry sky suddenly fell silent.

The 12 Demon Guard frowned and were ready to attack at any moment!

Yang Ye and Cang Mo stood 300m away from each other, and Cang Mo had lost his other arm.

He’d lost both his arms now!

A strand of blood could be seen on the corner of Yang Ye’s mouth, but based on his speed of recovery, such an injury was insignificant to him.

Cang Mo’s gaze descended on the Sword Gourd by Yang Ye’s waist. The sword there was truly too sharp!

Of course, the sword in Yang Ye’s grasp was very formidable as well!

Yang Ye was holding the Sword Precursor. It could bring forth his full strength, but Burial may not be able to do the same. The Sword Precursor was the most suitable sword for him, and it was the sword he could use the best!

But if it was in terms of sharpness alone, the Sword Precursor was inferior to Burial!

Cang Mo’s physical body was extremely strong, but he was facing one of the sharpest swords in the Three Dimensional Universe!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye grabbed the hilt of his sword. The others behind Cang Mo became vigilant and were prepared to act at any moment.

Yang Ye gazed at Cang Mo, cracked a smile, and said, “Advanced person of the Four Dimensional Universe, do you dare to take another swing of my sword?”

Do you dare?

It was spoken very calmly, but every word shook their hearts.

Cang Mo looked Yang Ye in the eyes, and a short while passed before he smiled, “I apologize for looking down on you. You’re an opponent worthy of respect.”

As he spoke, he walked slowly in Yang Ye’s direction.

The guards behind him were about to act, but he suddenly said, “Don’t bring shame to our Four Dimensional Universe. If any of you dare to interfere, you’ll be my greatest enemy in this life!”

The guards were very conflicted and put in a difficult position.

Shame!

How could they not realize that if they interfered now, it would be an embarrassment? However, if they didn’t interfere, could Cang Mo resist another attack from the young man?

Cang Mo had lost both his arms, and his pike had been slashed into bits by Burial. He only had his body now.

But Yang Ye was completely whole, and he had two swords too!

However, Cang Mo had still chosen to face Yang Ye on his own!

Yang Ye closed his eyes slowly and held tightly onto the Sword Precursor.

At this moment, their hearts were one!

The Enlightened Sword Heart!

Actually, Yang Ye noticed that he’d been mistaken in the past. The Enlightened Sword Heart wasn’t just capable of seeing through flaws, the true Enlightened Sword Heart was actually the linkage of man and sword, and the mutual enlightenment they had!

When he treated the sword as something he should protect, he discovered that the Sword Dao was that complicated. Of course, it was also simple. It all depended on how he thought of it.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly opened his eyes.

A sword howl blasted open the sky.

A ray of sword energy slashed down at Cang Mo!

Cang Mo calmly watched the sword energy grow closer and closer to him, and then… It stabbed into his throat. As soon as it stabbed halfway into his throat, Cang Mo clamped his palms down on Yang Ye’s sword. A moment later, his body started to expand and exploded.

Self-detonation!

Boom!

In an instant, all the Demon Guards in the surroundings were blasted far away, and the space before him was obliterated inch by inch!

All of them were shocked and hurriedly shot backward.

Because the space in front of them was still being obliterated!

Just like that, they retreated for almost 15 minutes before they finally stopped, and the area before them was pitch black. They couldn’t see anything!

Even dark matter had been completely obliterated!

The self-detonation of a peak Destiny Realm expert was absolutely terrifying!

The pitch black space took almost 15 minutes to gradually start recovering, and it fell silent once more after it was fully repaired.

The guards hurriedly looked over, and they saw a figure there!

Yang Ye!

They didn’t say a single word and immediately charged at him.

They knew Yang Ye had won! However, it had definitely been a pyrrhic victory. After all, Yang Ye couldn’t be completely unharmed from the self-detonation of a Destiny Realm expert!

So, it was their best opportunity to kill him!

Suddenly, a woman appeared before them. It was An Nanjing.

She stretched out her hand, and a spear appeared in her grasp.

Dagger-Axe!

Snowy had repaired it!

An Nanjing gazed coldly at the 12 experts before her, and they didn’t stop.

Suddenly, An Nanjing vanished on the spot.

The battle erupted!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye looked ahead. There was a pile of fragments before him, and they were from the armor he’d been wearing. Besides that, Heavenshield was completely cracked open on his arms!

He'd relied on the armor and Heavenshield to survive the explosion just now!

Of course, while he’d survived, it wasn’t easy. The impact of the explosion had cracked open his body and internal organs.

Yang Ye walked slowly to the side and withdrew another chair before slumping down on it. A moment later, drops of blood kept dripping down the chair.

He placed his right hand on the armrest. Actually, it couldn’t even be called a hand because it had been completely cracked open and had even warped.

Yang Ye looked toward the distance, and a long time passed before he laughed with self-ridicule, “It isn’t that easy to play the hero!”
