Chapter 2628

No!

Yang Ye suddenly noticed that she wasn’t the same woman he’d met that day!

Their appearances were the same, but their dressing was completely different!

That woman had been wearing a pure and flawless white dress, and she seemed like a pure and untainted goddess from the heavens.

But this woman before him may have the same appearance as her, but her bearing was completely different.

Moreover, the woman wore a pitch black dress, and she had pitch black pupils and hair… It was like she’d emerged from ink itself.

She was completely black!

At this moment, the woman had undoubtedly drawn the attention of everyone here.

Of course, besides curiosity, their eyes were mostly filled with fear!

The woman’s gaze descended onto Qi Bitian first.

Qi Bitian shrugged, “I didn’t expect it to be you!”

The woman didn’t say anything. She glanced at the surroundings, and then she raised her right hand.

Hiss!

The entire Origin World shook violently, and then a strand of mysterious energy locked down the entire Origin World!

It had been sealed off!

At this moment, the entire Origin World had been sealed off!

The expressions of everyone here instantly became unsightly when they noticed this!

Obviously, she planned to get them all!

Everyone here became vigilant.

In the sky.

The woman’s gaze descended onto Qi Bitian again. A moment later, a strand of invisible energy descended from the sky.

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!

At this moment, the space throughout the Origin World started to ripple.

This energy was so strong that it could easily erase the Origin World from existence. No, it could even erase Three Dimension Space from existence!

It truly transcended Three Dimensional Space!

Everything, including the Laws and Heaven Dao! All of them were useless before her!

Overwhelming strength!

Obviously, her main objective was to deal with Qi Bitian as she felt that Qi Bitian was the biggest threat.

Qi Bitian grinned, and then she formed a claw with her right hand and clawed upward.

Sky Claw!

An ethereal claw tore through space and surged upward.

Everywhere it passed, space exploded apart, inch by inch!

The powerful energy it contained caused everyone here to be visibly moved!

However, the ethereal claw stopped in midair, and then it exploded apart and was obliterated before anyone could discern what had happened!

The woman in a black dress tapped her right foot down.

Bam!

Qi Bitian was instantly blasted over 30km away!

The others here turned ghastly pale when they witnessed this.

At this moment, they were beyond shocked.

They had experienced Qi Bitian’s strength for themselves, yet now…

Qi Bitian patted her chest and looked up at the woman in black. She smiled, “Just that isn’t enough to kill me.”

The woman gazed coldly at Qi Bitian, “Are you still not going to unseal yourself?”

Unseal herself! ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Everyone gazed at Qi Bitian with shock. She was still suppressing her own strength?

Qi Bitian shook her head and smiled, “Why would I do that? Let’s just fight like this. After all, you’re not complete either. Moreover, you’re in your weakest state.”

Qi Bitian vanished on the spot once she finished speaking.

A moment later, a wave of powerful energy surged up from the bridge, and it caused the entire Origin World to tremble violently!

An expanse of space just vanished into thin air!

Countless were horrified by this and shot backward. However, a strand of mysterious energy would stop them upon moving a certain distance backward!

Many became quite hesitant when they noticed this.

Cang Hua suddenly said, “Everyone, why don’t we join forces against her? If we can’t deal with her, none of us will be able to survive!”

Join forces?

All of them exchanged glances.

Join forces with Qi Bitian?

“What’s the rush?” Suddenly, a voice resounded. They looked toward its source and saw Mr. Jing.

Mr. Jing spoke indifferently, “Don’t forget her true goal. If we help her now, she’ll still kill us later. So, why don’t we wait until they’re both seriously injured?”

Many of the experts here nodded.

It was best if Qi Bitian and the other woman in black could fight to the death. Even if they didn’t die in battle, it was great if both of them got severely injured. At that time, they could reap the rewards!

“What a bunch of idiots!” Suddenly, the Desolate Emperor chuckled, “Just continue waiting for your chance to take advantage of them. In the end, you’ll notice that regardless of which one of them wins the battle, all of you will die. I’m not going to continue playing with all of you!”

His figure shook and shot out of the Origin World!

It didn’t take long for an invisible barrier to obstruct him!

A ferocious grin appeared on his face, and he clenched his fist before slamming it forward.

Boom!

The Origin World shook, and then a translucent vortex suddenly appeared before him.

Destroying Three Dimensional Space!

That part of Three Dimensional Space had been destroyed. The Desolate Emperor was about to enter the translucent vortex when an ethereal sword appeared behind him.

The Desolate Emperor’s pupils constricted. He didn’t dare to underestimate the strength or it, and he immediately turned around and slapped his palm at it.

The space in front of him instantly warped before this attack…

“How dare you! You dare to steal the power of Four Dimensional Space!” Suddenly, a cold shout came from a distant point in space.

Obviously, it was the woman in black.

Hiss!

As soon as she said that, the sound of something being sliced open resounded, and then an arm flew up into the air!

It was the Desolate Emperor’s arm!

However, the Desolate Emperor had vanished!

He'd fled!

Actually, he’d been able to flee from the very beginning. However, if he tried it then, he would have to suffer the woman’s rage. It wasn’t wise to flee then.

But now, she was in battle with Qi Bitian, so it was the best opportunity for him to flee. Even though it would force him to expose a little of his strength and make the woman remember him, all that mattered was being able to escape.

It was a battle that could never be won!

Perhaps many didn’t know much about the woman in black, but he knew a little. Or it should be said, he knew a little about Qi Bitian’s era.

At that time, Qi Bitian and many other extraordinary geniuses were present then, including Chen Xuanan, Wu Ni, and many others… But they were either dead or had fled… Why?

It was because that existence was truly terrifying!

Many realized how serious the situation was when they saw the Desolate Emperor flee. Actually, besides Cang Hua and a few others who were from Qi Bitian’s era, most didn’t know how terrifying the woman in black was.

Even if she wasn’t whole, she was absolutely not someone they could go against!

Suddenly, the sky shook, and a figure fell slowly.

Yang Ye’s expression changed drastically, and he hurried over. It was because the figure belonged to Qi Bitian!

Yang Ye carried her down to the bridge. At this moment, her entire left arm was gone!

Both her arms were gone!

Moreover, there was an ethereal sword in her chest!

Tian Xiu frowned at the sight of this, and then she looked up at the sky. A moment later, she shot up into the sky.

Yang Ye held Qi Bitian’s armless body in his arms and spoke in a trembling voice, “Little Qi, I’m sorry…”

Qi Bitian shook her head slightly, “Don’t feel guilty. I owe Erya, and I should repay her.”

Yang Ye wanted to say more, but the sky shook violently at this moment.

Yang Ye hurriedly looked up. Meanwhile, Qi Bitian spoke softly, “She exhausted too much of her strength just now, so she’s no match for that woman now. Tell her to come back here.”

Suddenly, space started to explode inch by inch in the sky, and then a loud explosion resounded before a figure fell from the sky!

It was Tian Xiu!

Tian Xiu fell to the bridge, and her entire left arm was gone.

Blood was spraying like a fountain!

Tian Xiu wiped off the blood on the corner of her mouth and looked up at the sky with an unprecedentedly solemn expression on her face.

She seemed to have thought of something at this point and gazed at Qi Bitian, “Aren’t you going to unseal yourself?”

Qi Bitian shook her head, “If I do that, we’ll die even faster. Now, she’s in her weakest state. If I unseal myself, it’ll definitely be noticed by another state of hers. At that time, we’ll all be dead!”

Tian Xiu spoke solemnly, “She’s too strong!”

Qi Bitian grinned, “She’s someone who has lived for countless years and once erased a universe from existence… Of course she’s strong!”

The woman in a black dress appeared in the sky once more.

She was holding a pitch black sword!

A pure black sword!

It was this sword which had taken Qi Bitian and Tian Xiu’s left arms!

The woman gazed at Tian Xiu and was about to attack when she suddenly seemed to have noticed something. She gazed at Yang Ye, or to be more precise, she gazed at Yang Ye’s stomach, “The Evil Beast!”

In an instant, a ferocious expression appeared on the woman’s face.

Qi Bitian said, “She was once injured by Erya, and it was when she was in her complete form!”

Meanwhile, Snowy started to send countless strands of World Energy toward Qi Bitian, but the latter gazed at Snowy and shook her head, “Little fellow, it’s pointless. Unless you can return to your original form, otherwise, no energy can heal this injury.”

Snowy blinked, and then looked down while feeling slightly ashamed.

Meanwhile, the woman gazed at Snowy, and her eyes narrowed, “Good… All of you deserve death!”

A moment later, two ethereal black swords shot down from the sky!

One of them was aimed at Yang Ye while the other was aimed at Snowy!

Snowy was shocked and about to wave her paw. However, a sword howl suddenly resounded from the distant sky.

Along with the sword howl, the two ethereal black swords shook violently and stopped just a few meters away from Yang Ye and Snowy.

The woman turned to the side, and on the distant bridge, a sword cultivator in cloud white robes was walking over slowly.
