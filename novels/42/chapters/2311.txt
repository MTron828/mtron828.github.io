Chapter 2312 – You’re Brave!

Butcher was truly quite furious this time.

Yang Ye had used the same move again!

Even though it was effective, and that was the Skywalker Wolf’s only weak point, it was embarrassing! If word of it were to get out, the Primal Saber Sect would probably become a laughingstock!

Moreover, he was really curious about why Yang Ye kept using this move. After all, his sect didn’t teach this move!

Was it another one of his creations?

Meanwhile, Bai Zhixian hurriedly walked over to Yang Ye. Her heart rose to her throat when she saw the terrible state he was in. She hesitated for a moment and gazed at Butcher, “Martial Uncle, I think that it doesn’t matter what move is used, so long as it can kill, it’s a good move. What do you think?”

Actually, she felt it was a terrible move too, but if she placed herself in his shoes, there was nothing wrong with it. The Skywalker Wolf’s strength far surpassed Yang Ye, so if he didn’t use such a move, he would definitely suffer terribly.

Butcher shook his head, “This fellow… Forget it, take him to recuperate. I need some time alone!”

He vanished into the distance once he finished speaking.

Bai Zhixian glanced at Yang Ye, and then she took him in her arms and brought him back to the village.

In the bamboo house, Yang Ye laid on the bed as his Primordial Violet Energy ceaselessly repaired his body. However, without the Primordial Pagoda, both its amount and recovery speed were much inferior.

Medicine!

Bai Zhixian withdrew the jade bottle and started applying the green liquid on Yang Ye again.

He was subconsciously against this because Yang Ye seemed to enjoy letting her rub the medicine on him. Some unspeakable things always happened. However, no one else but her could do this.

Fortunately, she got used to it after some time of doing it.

Just like that, that embarrassing thing occurred once more in the room.

…

At the village entrance, Butcher, the slovenly old man, and Auntie Vege were gathered here.

Butcher sat on the ground. He cupped his fist to them and said, “Big Sis, Second Brother, it was supposed to be my own problem, but that place is truly too dangerous, and I’m not confident in being able to succeed alone. So, I have to ask for your help.”

Auntie Vege frowned slightly, “You plan to get that saber?”

Butcher nodded, “That chopper is extraordinary, but it doesn’t suit that kid. His physical strength is tremendous, and the strength in his arms even surpasses some descendants of Primal Demons. He should use a heavy saber, and that saber of my Primal Saber Sect just happens to be perfect!”

The old man spoke solemnly, “In the beginning, I thought you accepted him as your disciple for fun, and I never expected you to be serious!”

“How can I not be serious?” Butcher shook his head, “We don’t even know how much longer we’ll be able to survive in this place. If I don’t pass down my Primal Saber Sect’s inheritance to that kid now, my sect will vanish from this world. After all, we’re not from the same sect, my sect is only passed down to a single heir!”

“You can’t go!” Meanwhile, Auntie Vege spoke abruptly.

Butcher was puzzled, “Why?”

She looked toward the rear mountains, “It’s getting more and more unstable over there. The outer area is fine, but the depths of it…”

She frowned, “They are probably up to something.”

Butcher and the old man had solemn expressions on their faces.

Butcher asked, “What are they up to now?”

She replied indifferently, “Escape this place, of course. Unfortunately, it’ll all be in vain!”

“Why?” Butcher spoke solemnly, “According to my knowledge, their bloodlines are extremely pure, and one of them can even be considered as a true Primal Demon. That fellow has been constantly cultivating all these years, so his strength is probably at the peak of this world. If they join forces, I think they have a chance!”

Auntie Vege gazed at Butcher, “Do you think that existence has been eating and sleeping all these years? We’re constantly growing stronger, but isn’t he?”

Butcher asked, “Would we have no chance, even if we join them?”

She shook her head, “If we had a chance, that sly old man wouldn’t be making preparations for his death right now.”

She stood up slowly, “We don’t have much time left. Third Brother, if you still have things to teach, then do it. Those two little fellows must leave this place before those fellows start causing trouble. As for those three sabers of your Primal Saber Sect, forget them for now.”

She turned around and left.

Butcher spoke solemnly, “This little village has been peaceful for far too long.”

He vanished into the distance once he finished speaking.

…

Butcher led Yang Ye to the rear mountains as soon as he finished recuperating. Bai Zhixian naturally went with them. After all, she was the only one who could calm him down, and Yang Ye dared to attack anyone but her.

They arrived at the same forest.

It wasn’t that Butcher was obsessed with it, but the Skywalker Wolf was the only demon he knew that was slightly weaker. The rest of them were too strong, and he was worried that they would be too much for Yang Ye.

Butcher glanced at the forest, “I refuse to believe you haven’t learned your lesson after suffering that twice.”

He stomped his right foot down.

Bang!

The forest shook violently, and then he waved his right hand and moved 300m back with Bai Zhixian.

Boom!

A black shadow charged out of the forest, and it charged straight at Yang Ye. However, it didn’t take long for it to stop.

It was the Skywalker Wolf!

A ferocious expression instantly covered its face when it saw Yang Ye, and a fierce glow arose in its eyes. It roared incessantly at Yang Ye as if Yang Ye had murdered its mother.

Yang Ye slightly twisted his body sideways and tightened his grip on his chopper.

However, the wolf just roared and didn’t attack.

Butcher frowned, “What the heck is it doing?”

Suddenly, Yang Ye charged at it. But Bai Zhixian and Butcher watched with astonishment as it chose not to fight, and it leaped up and vanished into the forest instead.

Both of them were stunned.

“It fled?” Butcher gulped, “It fled? What the heck?”

Bai Zhixian felt speechless.

A short while passed before Butcher was certain that it had really fled!

It had fled!

A demon with the bloodline of a Primal Demon had fled just like that! It had fled without even fighting!

Butcher stared at Yang Ye. Obviously, it was afraid that Yang Ye would cut off its thing again!

Butcher gave Yang Ye a thumbs up, “You’re amazing! You have balls!”

Yang Ye didn’t give him any reply.

Butcher didn’t return to the village and walked deeper into the forest instead, “Bring him. I’m going to find him a new opponent.”

Bai Zhixian glanced at Yang Ye and spoke softly, “Take care of yourself!”

She took his hand and followed after Butcher.

Just like that, Butcher led them deeper into the rear mountains.

The rear mountains was a huge and very dangerous place!

That was what Bai Zhixian felt. After they passed through the forest, a boundless mountain range appeared before them. During this time, she sensed numerous formidable auras, and they were all at the True World Realm at least!

Bai Zhixian was extremely shocked!

She hadn’t expected that there were so many extraordinarily strong existences throughout Eternal Secret Realm, but the people outside knew nothing of it!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly grabbed her hand. She turned around and looked at him. He didn’t say anything, but a powerful wave of intent had appeared around her.

Yang Ye sensed danger, so he was protecting her! Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Bai Zhixian gazed at him for a very long time. Suddenly, she touched his face gently and spoke softly, “Emotions will be your death!”

“You’re wrong!” Suddenly, Butcher said, “Those who cherish these emotions and stay loyal may have some shackles in their lives, but it is not necessarily a bad thing. Just like this kid. If he was a ruthless person who stopped at nothing, I’m certain that sly old man would have definitely killed him. Even I would have killed him. You may not be aware of it, but if Wang Erya hadn’t been there to lead him into the village, he may have died before he could even get into the village!”

Bai Zhixian was puzzled, “Why?”

Butcher smiled, “While the people of our village aren’t saints, we aren’t bloodthirsty killers either. But this kid came in with slaughter intent and madness intent. As far as we were concerned, he isn’t a good person. People with slaughter intent are normally bloodthirsty people, people who kill intentionally just to improve their slaughter intent. People like that can improve their slaughter intent tremendously, but it harms the balance of the world.”

He smiled and continued, “Moreover, this kid has madness intent, and that isn’t just as simple as killing. So, in the beginning, I thought he went mad from killing!”

Bai Zhixian felt speechless.

Butcher continued, “There is too much injustice in this world. You must kill if you wish to resist it, and this kid is clearly not someone who will make compromises or admit defeat. His character makes his life one that will never be peaceful.”

Butcher shook his head at this point, “In short, he’s not a good person, but he isn’t a bad person either.”

Bai Zhixian fell silent.

A good person? A bad person?

When she wanted to take Yang Ye’s treasures, Yang Ye was a bad person to her; yet now that she was with Yang Ye, she felt that Yang Ye was a good person.

The determination of good and bad was usually decided by the interests of the person who was making the judgment. If the person was of help to you, then that person would be a good person; if that person planned to harm you, then even if that person has done many good deeds, that person will still be a bad person to you!

Rumble!

Suddenly, the mountain range shook violently.

Butcher’s expression changed as he looked off into the distance, and his pupils constricted.

Bai Zhixian’s countenance had turned ghastly pale.

A towering giant was walking slowly from the distant mountain range. It was taller than the mountain range itself, and every step it took would instantly flatten a mountain. The giant was walking in their direction, and it was walking in the direction of the village.
