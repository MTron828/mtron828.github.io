Chapter 1959 – Genius Concentration Camp!

Guilty?

Everyone had a weird expression on their faces.

Because Yang Ye didn’t look like he was guilty at all.

Black Devil stared at Yang Ye from high above in the sky. A long while passed before he suddenly grinned, “I didn’t expect you to be a sword cultivator too. Good, very good.” He glanced at A’Man and the others, “We’ll remember this.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he turned around and left with the others from Devil Cave.

Meanwhile, A’Man appeared before Yang Ye, sized him up, and asked, “A sword cultivator?”

Yang Ye nodded.

A’Man asked, “You’re a body cultivator at the same time?”

Yang Ye nodded again.

She asked, “Which one is auxiliary?”

Yang Ye glanced at her and asked, “Why?”

She sized up Yang Ye and explained, “If your body cultivation is your main method of cultivation and the sword is auxiliary, then I have to tell you that you have a problem with your body; but if your sword is the main method of cultivation while your body is just auxiliary, then it's fine.”

Yang Ye replied, “My body is auxiliary. However, I want to know what’s wrong with it!”

A'Man suddenly tapped Yang Ye’s chest.

Crack!

Yang Ye’s chest cracked open, and blood instantly seeped out.

Yang Ye was stunned.

A’Man said, “If I’m not wrong, you mostly used external forces to forcefully improve your body!”

Yang Ye nodded, “Yes!”

A’Man explained, “That can provide you with formidable physical strength and defenses in the short term, but do you realize what kind of disadvantages it brings?”

Yang Ye shook his head. He’d always been discovering his way of cultivating the body on his own.

A’Man didn’t answer him. She gazed at Qin Chuan and the others instead, “All of you come over here!”

Qin Chuan and the others went over to A’Man and surrounded her.

A’Man glanced at them and spoke seriously, “There are no shortcuts when it comes to cultivating. Even if there are shortcuts, you shouldn’t rashly take those shortcuts. Because they aren’t worth it! As far as I’m concerned, the most terrifying thing isn’t the ability to smash a rock with one punch, it’s that dripping water will one day pierce through a rock.”

Qin Chuan suddenly asked, “Why?”

A'Man replied, “The process!”

A’Man glanced at them and continued, “Most of you pay too much attention to the outcome and overlook the process. You don’t realize that the most important part in cultivation is the process.”

“The process?” Yu Jing suddenly asked, “Can you make it simpler for us to understand?”

A'Man explained, “You should be aware that I’m at the Hear Dao Realm, but do you know that if I want, I can actually attain the Know Dao Realm or go even higher!”

All of them were stunned speechless.

She continued, “There are many reasons why I don’t charge up intentionally. One of them is this process. I don’t want the outcome, I want the process. The process of cultivation allows me to comprehend a lot!”

Meanwhile, Mad Saber suddenly said, “Gradual improvement!”

A’Man glanced at Mad Saber and nodded slightly, “In short, it’s gradual improvement. Or it should be called an advancement that comes naturally! For example, a cup is only half full, but in order to fill that cup and make it overflow, water isn’t even the first thought that comes to many. They think of other methods instead. For example, putting a rock in or something else. While the water will still overflow like that, it’s not real.”

She gazed at Yang Ye and continued, “Your body seems strong, but it’s actually very weak. Because you used external forces to improve it.”

Yang Ye pondered deeply for a long time and nodded, “I understand!”

“As for your Sword Dao…” She suddenly stopped when she spoke up to this point.

Yang Ye gazed at her.

She shook her head slightly, “I don’t know anything about the Sword Dao, so I can’t help you.”

Yang Ye smiled, “No matter what, thank you! But is there a way to mend my body?”

A’Man nodded slightly, “Your body’s foundation is terrible. If you want to improve it and fortify your foundation, then there’s only one way to accomplish that!”

Yang Ye asked, “What is it?” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

A’Man looked Yang Ye in the eyes, “Suffer a beating!”

“Suffer a beating?” Yang Ye was slightly stunned, “What do you mean?”

She explained, “Do you know how metal is tempered?”

Yang Ye nodded.

A'Man said, “Your current body is a rough outline of a sword, and it hasn’t been fully formed into the shape of a sword. Moreover, it’s filled with impurities. So, it needs to be tempered. It’s the simplest method, and the simplest is usually the most effective. However, it’s very painful!”

Qin Chuan and the others chuckled when they heard this.

Suffer a beating!

Very few took the path of body cultivation because it was too painful, and it grew more and more painful as one progressed further. Moreover, a body cultivator’s strength was quite weak. Especially those who weren’t very accomplished, they were usually just useless sandbags!

Of course, true body cultivators were extremely terrifying!

A’Man said, “Just think about it.”

She turned around and left. The others dispersed as well.

Yang Ye sat down cross-legged and sent his mind into the Primordial Pagoda.

Yang Ye asked, “Senior, is she right?”

“Very much so!” Hou Qing spoke solemnly, “Kid, that woman isn’t ordinary. I heard a similar theory from the Shaman Progenitor. However, I didn’t pay too much attention to it. Moreover, the shaman race’s methods of body cultivation aren't inferior to the demon race or devil race. So, just do as she said and get beaten up!”

Get beaten!

Yang Ye laughed bitterly. While his body was strong, he didn’t want to get beaten up for nothing!

Moreover, even if he wanted to, he had to find someone who possessed an extremely strong body… like A’Man!

But her strength was a little too strong!

After playing with Snowy, Bao’er, and the others in the Primordial Pagoda, Yang Ye returned to the outside world.

Night had arrived, and the surroundings had fallen silent.

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings. Besides those who were on night watch, the others were seated cross-legged and resting.

Resting!

As far as they were concerned, resting was extremely important. However, they didn’t sleep like ordinary people, and they were regulating their breathing and keeping themselves at a peak state.

Yang Ye looked up. Suddenly, a black dot appeared in the sky, and then a few wyverns appeared above the city walls.

Wyverns!

Yang Ye fell silent for a moment. Suddenly, he leaped up and went up the city walls.

The five men there gazed at him, and he said, “Let me do it! I want to train! Thanks!”

They exchanged glances, and then one of them smiled, “Of course!”

As soon as they finished speaking, he leaped off the wall with the others.

Only Yang Ye remained there.

Yang Ye took a deep breath as he gazed at the wyvern which had arrived above him, and then he stomped his right foot down and shot up at it.

He’d benefited tremendously from the last battle he had with a wyvern.

Now, he’d just attained the Enlightened Realm, so he naturally couldn’t charge into a higher realm of cultivation. While he couldn’t improve his cultivation for now, he could still improve himself in other aspects. For example, his body and speed. The fastest method to improve his body and speed was battle!

These wyverns just happened to be great sparring partners!

A'Man suddenly opened her eyes on the ground below, and she looked up at Yang Ye. A short while passed before she nodded slightly and withdrew her gaze.

Battle!

In the next few days, Yang Ye took the night watch. In the beginning, the others helped him, so only a single wyvern went to him. But now, there was one more wyvern in front of him because A’Man told them to let one more get to him.

Two wyverns!

Yang Ye was completely suppressed in battle while facing two wyverns!

He almost died on many occasions!

He knew that it was impossible to fight two wyverns while using just his body, but right when he was about to use his sword, A’Man’s cold voice resounded, “You’re not allowed to use your sword!”

He wasn’t allowed to use his sword!

A bitter expression covered Yang Ye’s face, “I can’t hold on!”

If he could use the Gold Form, then he could fight them. However, A’Man didn’t let him use that either!

So, at this point in the battle, his entire body was covered in injuries. It wasn’t just his body, even his face had quite a few deep marks.

“You can’t?” Suddenly, A’Man appeared in front of him, and then she waved her right hand. A wave of powerful energy blasted both the wyverns away, but it only took a moment for them to dive down towards her and Yang Ye.

A’Man looked him in the eyes and said, “Watch carefully! Gu Li, show him how it’s done!”

A comparatively robust man suddenly leaped up the city wall.

Meanwhile, A’Man brought Yang Ye off the city wall.

A’Man looked up and said, “Watch carefully!”

Yang Ye looked up. The two wyverns had arrived before Gu Li. Suddenly, Gu Li roared with fury, and then he slammed his body against them!

A head-on collision!

Gu Li fought two on his own, but he wasn’t disadvantaged at all, and he even showed signs of suppressing them in battle!

“His name is Gu Li, and he’s a human body cultivator too.” A’Man suddenly said, “Just like you, he’s at the 1st stage of the Enlightened Realm. Since he can do it, why can’t you?”

Yang Ye fell silent.

A’Man gazed at Yang Ye, ‘You’re a sword cultivator. You can fight two of them with your sword, but you’ve chosen the path of body cultivation too. Since you’ve chosen that path, you should cultivate it well too. Otherwise, just cultivate your sword well and don’t think about anything else. Because if you do, you won’t be accomplished in anything.”

Yang Ye looked up at Gu Li who’d suppressed both the wyverns, “How did he accomplish that?”

A'Man replied, “Since he arrived here, he lingered between the border of life and death at least three times every single day.”

She glanced at Yang Ye and continued, “The most terrifying thing a person can face is death. However, at most times, a person will erupt with boundless potential when facing death. You were at the border between life and death earlier, but the first thing which came to mind for you was your sword. Let me ask you something, what would you do if even your sword can’t stop them?”

Yang Ye didn’t know how to answer her!
