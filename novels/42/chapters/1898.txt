Chapter 1899 – Shaman Hunters!

What’s going on?

Yang Ye suddenly looked up at the small bird on her shoulder. It was a completely pitch black fist-sized bird. At this moment, Yang Ye noticed that it only had a single leg, and it was looking at him.

It was just looking at him!

The bird’s eyes were pitch black. No matter how he looked at it, it didn’t seem special. However, Yang Ye felt a chill run down his spine when it looked at him!

It wasn’t ordinary!

Yang Ye was about to speak when the woman suddenly patted the bird, and it immediately lowered its head and stopped looking at Yang Ye.

After that, she grinned at Yang Ye and entered her own room.

Meanwhile, Nansi Yin suddenly said, “She’s not ordinary!”

Yang Ye glanced at Nansi Yin and didn’t say a word. He just walked into his room.

Nansi Yin shrugged, “Do you have to be so arrogant?”

…

Meanwhile, in a room. The woman gazed at the bird, and her lips moved slightly. She seemed to be talking to it.

The woman suddenly asked, “The shaman race’s aura?”

The bird nodded slightly.

She frowned a little, “Are you sure?”

The bird hesitated for a moment, shook its head, and then its beak started moving.

A short while later, the woman’s frown deepened.

…

In Yang Ye’s room, Yang Ye had just sat down cross-legged, and then Hou Qing’s voice resounded in his mind, “Kid, you must remember that while you’re amongst the human race, you must never expose the aura of the shaman race that you carry. Otherwise, you’ll be in a huge amount of trouble. This isn’t the lower universe, and you can’t just deter everyone by killing a few people. The more you kill, and the stronger those people are, the more the human race will refuse to let you live!”

The aura of the shaman race!

Yang Ye spoke solemnly, “I know. I’ve used the Sword Domain to suppress it!”

Hou Qing sighed softly, “Kid, the Sword Domain isn’t almighty. Besides various powerful experts, there are other beings with strange and extraordinary talents, or even some treasures. Sigh, just be careful!”

Yang Ye nodded. He was being careful. After all, it wasn’t fun to be pursued by those so-called righteous people.

After talking with Hou Qing for a while, Yang Ye went to the cultivation room. Yang Lianshuang and the others were here.

But at this moment, all of them were cultivating.

Yang Ye’s gaze descended onto Sky Maiden. At this moment, her entire body was emanating faint black light, and she seemed like a tiny vortex.

Hou Qing’s voice suddenly resounded, “Her cultivation technique isn’t ordinary!”

Yang Ye asked, “What do you mean?”

Hou Qing replied, “I don’t know. It’s just a feeling. She’s undergoing a qualitative transformation. Once she succeeds, she’ll become extremely terrifying.”

Yang Ye shook his head, “But it’s taking too long!”

“Too long?” Hou Qing replied, “This isn’t a long time at all. Some even cultivate behind closed doors for 100 years to cultivate a cultivation technique or combat technique. To a certain extent, the longer it takes to cultivate, the better the technique is. So, if she succeeds, it’ll definitely be extraordinary.”

Yang Ye glanced at her and nodded. He hoped for that too.

Yang Ye didn’t disturb all of them. He just sat down cross-legged and placed his sword by his side. The sword instantly vanished on the spot.

It had gone to Snowy!

Even though Snowy was quite mischievous, she was still kind and pure. So, she was loved by beings naturally formed from the world and conscious beings alike.

Yang Ye smiled and closed his eyes. It didn’t take long for faint golden light to appear around him.

The Gold Form!

He wasn’t just at the Divine Realm of strength; he possessed the Gold Form. It could be said that ordinary Enlightened Realm experts couldn’t harm him at all.

Besides that, he’d merged everything he’d learned in the past, simplified them, and improved them. So, his attacks were even simpler and sharper. Besides that, he had the Sword Domain!

He was slowly developing the Sword Domain, and not just defensively. Activating the Sword Domain in battle wasn’t just able to suppress his opponents, it could improve the strength of his attacks!

It could be said that while he was just at the 6th stage of the True Realm, ordinary Enlightened Realm experts were nothing before him.

However, Yang Ye knew that such strength was far from sufficient in the upper universe. He had many things that he wanted to do, and the precondition for them is possessing powerful strength.

Cultivate!

Besides ceaselessly improving his sword techniques, Yang Ye had to work hard on improving his cultivation. His cultivation was his foundation, so he naturally wouldn’t overlook it. He believed that once he attained the Enlightened Realm, his strength would undergo a qualitative change!

The Fruit of Rebirth and energy pearls!

Yang Ye withdrew them all. Improving his cultivation required a huge amount of spirit energy. Fortunately, he had no shortage of that.

Time trickled by. Three months had passed in the Primordial Pagoda.

At this moment, the aura Yang Ye emanated was growing stronger and stronger, but he immediately restrained it every single time.

Just like that, Yang Ye sat there in a meditative state for two months. At this moment, the aura he occasionally released even made the surrounding space tremble.

Suddenly, Yang Ye opened his eyes.

Huff!

Yang Ye released a mouthful of foul air, and there was a trace of disappointment in his eyes.

He hadn’t attained the Enlightened Realm, but he’d touched the barrier between him and the Enlightened Realm. He wanted to charge through it, but he’d clearly failed.

“You can’t rush it!” Suddenly, Hou Qing said, “It’s very good that you were able to touch the barrier between the realms. You just need a fortuitous encounter, and you’ll be able to blast it open with ease. But some people aren’t able to come into contact with the barrier throughout their lifetimes!”

Yang Ye smiled, “I understand.”

He wasn’t very disappointed. Because while he hadn’t attained the Enlightened Realm, his gains throughout these few months had been really good. He’d fortified his cultivation, and it was very solid now. Besides that, he’d comprehended many things related to the Sword Dao.

Yang Ye left the Primordial Pagoda, and there was a knock on his door.

Yang Ye said, “Come in!”

The door opened, and Nansi Yin was there.

She sized up Yang Ye and said, “We’re almost at Northern Sky City!”

Yang Ye walked over to her, looked her in the eyes, and said, “I don’t know what you want, but I advise you not to follow me. I don’t have any other ability but the ability to cause trouble. I’m not joking.”

She said, “Are you trying to cast me aside after I’ve helped you?”

Yang Ye shook his head. He was about to speak when she suddenly smiled, “You wouldn’t be able to get to Broken Cliff Mountain without my help.”

Yang Ye asked, “What do you want?”

She blinked, “Nothing. I just think it’s fun because I’ve never been to the Shaman Dimension. As for you, you’re going there, right?”

Yang Ye said, “Do as you please!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he walked around her and left the room.

A playful smile curled up on the corners of Nansi Yin’s lips, “How interesting. Even with that damn woman’s ability, she was actually unable to discover your background. Interesting, truly interesting…”

Yang Ye walked to the corner of the Sound Shuttle’s front. There was a thin barrier of light around there, and it protected the Sound Shuttle’s passengers from its high speeds. The boundless starry sky was outside the barrier.

The boundless starry sky wasn’t any difference to the starry sky in the lower universe. It was similarly vast and deep.

Suddenly, a woman appeared by Yang Ye’s side.

She looked up towards the distance and spoke softly, “You’ve come to Northern Sky City to head to the Shaman Dimension?”DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Yang Ye turned to glance at her, and then he said, “So what if I am, so what if I’m not?”

She grinned, “What do you think of the shaman race?”

Yang Ye looked her in the eyes, “What are you trying to say?”

She smiled, “Nothing. I’m just asking. Is it very difficult for you to answer?”

Yang Ye withdrew his gaze and said, “What do I think about the shaman race? I don’t think anything about it. That’s my answer!”

Her eyes narrowed slightly, “What would you do if you encountered someone from the shaman race?”

Yang Ye spoke indifferently, “Nothing!”

She slowly clenched her left fist, “You’re a human. As a human, you actually won’t do anything to the shaman race?”

Yang Ye turned to look at her, “All the humans are good, and all the shamans are bad?”

She looked him in the eyes and didn’t say a word.

Yang Ye continued, “perhaps there’s some sort of enmity between you and the shaman race, but why do you have to place that enmity onto others? Since you hate the shaman race, you want others to hate the shaman race too? That isn’t very good, isn’t it?”

She suddenly grinned, “You have quite a good impression of the shaman race!”

Yang Ye replied, “My opinion of the human race and shaman race is the same.”

As far as he was concerned, the shaman race was made out of humans, and the human race was made out of humans too. Even though he had enmity with the Sovereign of Man, he didn’t eye the entire human race with hostility. He wasn’t a madman. Moreover, the Sovereign of Man couldn’t represent the entire human race. As for the shaman race, he hadn’t even come into contact with them, so he would naturally not be hostile towards them.

The enemies of the human race?

As far as he was concerned, it was just some tricks those in power were playing.

Simply speaking, Yang Ye had his own views and opinions, and he wouldn’t just follow what others said.

The woman fell silent when she heard him.

A short while passed before she suddenly looked up at Yang Ye, “I sense the aura of the shaman race coming from you!”

Yang Ye looked her in the eyes, “So what?”

She gazed at Yang Ye, and then the corners of her lips suddenly curled up slightly. An instant later, a blood red mark appeared at the center of her forehead. It was shaped like a sword, and it flickered with faint red light.

Meanwhile, Hou Qing’s anxious voice resounded in Yang Ye’s mind, “Kid, she’s a Shaman Hunter! Run!”

As soon as Hou Qing finished speaking, a dark red pike suddenly stabbed Yang Ye’s chest.

Hiss!

The pike pierced through his skin with absolute ease, and it continued straight forward towards his heart!
