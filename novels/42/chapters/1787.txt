Chapter 1788 – Schemes!

It didn’t take long for a woman with a huge saber to walk out slowly from the spatial rift.

Her figure flashed over to Yang Ye’s group, and then she gazed at Yang Ye and smiled, “Kid, long time no see!”

Yang Ye shook his head and smiled, “I didn’t expect it to be you!”

It was none other than the pig-riding young woman! He hadn’t expected her to show herself here!

The young woman smiled, “Are you surprised?”

Yang Ye nodded, “Very surprised! How did you find me?”

Yang Lianshuang gazed at her as well. Because Yang Ye’s question was the same question she wanted to ask.

The pig-riding young woman revealed a mysterious smile, “Give it a guess!”

Yang Ye shook his head, “I don’t have an answer.”

She smiled, “Remember the Worldmend Stone that my older sister gave you?”

The Worldmend Stone! Yang Ye nodded. He naturally remembered it because it was his second Dantian. However, as his cultivation grew higher, it wasn’t really useful anymore.

Meanwhile, she said, “Even though she gave it to you, she didn’t sever the spiritual link between her and the Worldmend Stone. So, she can sense it, and thus know where you are.”

I see! Yang Ye grinned. He hadn’t expected that it was the Worldmend Stone that had exposed him.

The pig-riding young woman suddenly asked, “You don’t blame us, right?”

Yang Ye was stunned for a moment, “What do you mean?”

She replied, “Our Pavilion Master agreed to help you and go to the Yang Clan with you, but we didn’t go in the end.”

“Oh, that!” Yang Ye chuckled, “It’s not a big deal. Moreover, there’s probably a reason why you didn’t come, right?” Even though he didn’t know the Nether Pavilion’s master well, the Nether Pavilion’s master didn’t seem like one to go back on his word!

The pig-riding young woman nodded, “We didn’t come because we received news about Pavilion Master Shao Siyou’s whereabouts.”

Shao Siyou! Yang Ye thought for a moment and said, “Why do all of you want to search for her?”

The pig-riding young woman fell silent for a moment and replied, “She’s very important to all of us. Actually, she never wanted to establish the Nether Pavilion, and she merely took in orphans she met. However, as time passed, she took in more and more orphans. In the end, she just made the Nether Pavilion, and she made all of us treat her as our Pavilion Master so that no one will bully us in the future!”

She paused for a moment and continued, “But one day, she met someone, and that person allowed her to discover another side of the Martial Dao. So, she made some arrangements and left. The reason we’re looking for her is that we want to know if she’s still alive or in the large universe! If she’s up there, we’ll go find her there; if she’s dead…. No, she is definitely not dead!”

Yang Ye said, “She’s very important to all of you!”

The pig-riding young woman nodded, “Extremely important. I came to see you for two reasons. Firstly, it’s because we know that you’re not in a very good situation right now. So, our eldest sister asked us to help you while she heads to Heaven Pillar Mountain.”

“Us?” Yang Ye asked, “You’re not the only one who has come? Nether Maiden and the others are here too?”

The pig-riding young woman replied, “Yes. Besides our eldest sister, second sister, and third sister, everyone else is here. However, they didn’t come in here. They’re on the outside.”

Nether Maiden and the others are here!Yang Ye felt extremely happy. Because he’d always treated them as good friends. Now that he heard they were here to help him, he was naturally happy.

Yang Ye seemed to have thought of something at this point, and then he sized up the pig-riding young woman, “Er… The experts of this medium universe are much stronger than the experts in Merak System. Your current strength….”

Boom!

Meanwhile, a powerful aura suddenly swept out from her, and it blasted Yang Ye around 100m back!

Yang Ye looked up at the pig-riding young woman, and a wisp of surprise flashed through his eyes, “You… you’re at the True Realm! What the heck! You’re actually at the True Realm!”

“What?!” She spoke with displeasure, “Only you can be in the True Realm?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “No. I mean that it isn’t possible to advance above the Rebirth Realm in Merak System, right?”

She nodded in response, “It’s impossible in Merak System, but not here. We didn’t cultivate in Merak System, we did it in the Milky Way System. Actually, it’s all thanks to you.”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “What do you mean?”

Meanwhile, Yang Lianshuang suddenly spoke, “In the past, the eight clans would be aware if any power entered the medium universe. If I’m not wrong, the reason they were able to sneak in was that you threw the medium universe into chaos after you got here. The eight clans haven’t been able to pay attention to any other trivial matters lately!”

The pig-riding young woman glanced at Yang Lianshuang and nodded, “Exactly.” She gazed at Yang Ye and continued, “All of us sisters have extraordinary natural talent. Once we’re not restricted anymore, wouldn’t charging into higher realms of cultivation be as easy as pie?”

The corners of Yang Ye’s mouth twitched slightly. As easy as pie… But it did make sense because all of them were extraordinary geniuses. If there were no limits placed upon them, then charging into higher realms of cultivation was extremely easy for them. There were countless monstrous geniuses in the boundless universe!

Nether Maiden and the others were such geniuses!

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts and gazed at the pig-riding young woman, “You said that you’re here for two reasons. What’s the other reason?”

“Heaven Pillar Mountain!” She spoke solemnly, “We want you to come to Heaven Pillar Mountain with us!”

“Why?” Yang Ye was puzzled. That woman in Sword Immortal City wanted him to go with her too, and they wanted the same. So, he was really puzzled by this.

The pig-riding young woman spoke solemnly, “Heaven Pillar Mountain links the medium universe with the large universe. It’s a path to the large universe, and it’s the only way to get there. However….”

“However, only two types of people can ascend to the large universe!” Yang Lianshuang suddenly spoke, “One of them is people with heaven defying strength. They can ascend there by force. According to my knowledge, in the tens of thousands of years that the medium universe has existed, only eight people have accomplished that. They are the founders of the eight clans.”

Yang Ye asked, “What about the other type?”

Yang Lianshuang grinned, “People like you!”

Yang Ye was even more puzzled, “What do you mean?”

She explained, “Actually, I just realized everything. If I’m not wrong, they’re here because of the wooden sword in your possession. That wooden sword isn’t from this medium universe.”

Yang Ye said, “Be a little more specific!”

Yang Lianshuang fell silent for a long time and said, “Heaven Pillar Mountain is a very terrifying place, and it’s the most terrifying place in our medium universe.”

The pig-riding young woman nodded, “It’s very terrifying indeed!”

Yang Ye shook his head, “Stop beating around the bush, alright?”

Yang Lianshuang gazed at Yang Ye, “If your father isn’t dead and isn’t in the large universe, then it’s very likely for him to be in Heaven Pillar Mountain!” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Why?”

“Because it’s the hope of the 6th stage True Realm experts!” Yang Lianshuang explained, “The only way to ascend to the large universe is through Heaven Pillar Mountain. The barrier there weakens every ten years. That’s the best opportunity for them to ascend to the large universe. So, countless old geezers and little monsters are gathered there. For example, people like you who aren’t at the 6th stage of the True Realm but possess equivalent strength.”

She paused for a moment and continued, “There aren’t just local cultivators from the medium universe that reside there, there are other older cultivators and even ancient cultivators. They didn’t ascend to the large universe when the barrier didn’t exist. Now, there’s a powerful barrier there, and those who created the barrier are clearly stronger than them. So, they have no choice but to wait until it weakens!”

Yang Ye was about to speak when Yang Lianshuang gazed at her, “Those aren’t even the most terrifying existences there. The most terrifying thing is that experts and demons from the large universe descend from time to time. Of course, most of them don’t descend with their main bodies, but even if it’s their clone, it’s still extremely terrifying. For example, Qiong Qi who’s within you!”

Yang Ye gazed at Yang Lianshuang, “Why do you know so much? Don’t tell me it’s because you’re the Yang Clan’s patriarch!”

She rolled her eyes, “I know so much because of the Undying Black Phoenix. Do you know why she died?”

Yang Ye asked, “Why?”

Yang Lianshuang replied solemnly, “Because she failed to get through Heaven Pillar Mountain!”

“Even she failed?” Yang Ye was astounded. After all, it was an ancient divine beast, and it was one of the extremely formidable ones!

Yang Lianshuang shook her head, “Actually, she was too conceited. Because she was injured when she attempted to get through there. Moreover, she didn’t do it when the barrier was at its weakest.”

So that’s why! Yang Ye nodded and asked, “Then why do you say that people like me can ascend to the large universe?”

“The wooden sword!” Meanwhile, the pig-riding young woman said, “Eldest Sister has been to Heaven Pillar Mountain and gathered some information. A sword fell down from the large universe, and it pierced through the barrier. However, it vanished with a head.”

She gazed at Yang Ye and continued, “But now, there’s news saying that the sword is in your possession, so you’re in trouble now. Because many people in Heaven Pillar Mountain are looking for that sword. Or to be more precise, they’re looking for you. So, Eldest Sister asked us to stay with you. Understand? The trouble I spoke about earlier isn’t those clans but this!”

The Secret Sect! Yang Ye’s expression became quite unsightly. Even an idiot would know that it was the Secret Sect that spread the news!

The Secret Sect was scheming against him!
