Chapter 2542

In the Ancient Sword Sect, Yang Ye suddenly looked down the mountain and vanished on the spot.

Yang Ye arrived before the woman.

He grinned as he gazed at her, “Long time no see!”

It was Nether Maiden.

It had been a very, very long time!

She sized up Yang Ye, and then she suddenly stretched out her hand. In an instant, a wave of mysterious energy enveloped him!

No!

It should be said that the energy had suddenly arisen from within him!

His vitality was leaving him!

At this moment, Yang Ye was aging at a visible rate, and it was extremely swift. In just a moment, he’d transformed from a young man into a wrinkled old man!

But a moment later, Nether Maiden waved her hand lightly, and the lifespan around him started to return. It didn’t take long for him to return to normal again.

Nether Maiden lowered her hand!

Yang Ye was extremely shocked!

A short while passed before Yang Ye asked, “Reversion of vitality?”

Nether Maiden shook her head, “Reversion of life and death!”

Life and death!

Yang Ye gulped, “Is that the power of the Laws?”

She glanced at him, “I created it myself based on the Laws. Anyone in a realm of cultivation below me can be killed in an instant!”

Yang Ye felt speechless.

“Some people are exceptions!” She added, “If you use the Sword Domain, you can isolate my ability from you.”

Yang Ye asked, “What realm of cultivation are you in?”

She replied, “The Five World Realm!”

Yang Ye gulped again.

What did that represent? It represented that experts at the Five World Realm couldn’t even fight back before her!

Yang Ye asked, “Can you fight Lord Realm experts?”

She glanced at him, “I can fight two!”

Yang Ye suddenly became extremely serious, “From this moment onward, you’re an Honorary Elder of the Ancient Sword Sect, and you can come and go as you please. You don’t have to obey anyone in the sect and…”

She interrupted him, “I’m not interested!”

Yang Ye was left speechless.

She added, “Someone told me that you were in trouble, so I came. I’m not interested in anything else!”

Yang Ye’s heart felt warm. He smiled, “I won’t say things like thank you. Come on, let’s head inside.”

Just like that, Yang Ye brought her into the sect.

Trouble!

True friends didn’t fear troubling the other. Friends? What were friends? There were many definitions! However, in Yang Ye’s world, friends were there for him to trouble them.

So, once he realized he had many enemies that were extremely strong, he’d immediately thought of Nether Maiden and the others.

Of course, this was limited to true friends!

Yang Ye led Nether Maiden around the Ancient Sword Sect!

Yang Ye asked, “Where are the others?”

She shook her head, “I don’t know!”

Yang Ye asked, “All of you didn’t stay together?”

She shook her head, “We separated after bidding farewell to you that day. According to our eldest sister, we must have our own lives. The world is huge, and we need to travel it. I encountered an old man with a bamboo chest in Eternal Kingdom, and he seemed to know you!”

“An old man with a bamboo chest?” Yang Ye gazed at her, “You’ve met him too?”

Nether Maiden nodded slightly, “He sent me to an unknown place filled with endless Death Energy and Life Energy. I comprehended the Laws of Reversion, and I can reverse many things now.”

She gazed at Yang Ye, “Swing your sword!”

Yang Ye pondered deeply for a moment and swung his sword at her.

Nether Maiden took a step back, and it was very, very slow. It was just a normal step back, but it was such a step back that allowed her to dodge Yang Ye’s attack which shot by like a bolt of lightning!

Yang Ye gazed at her with disbelief, “You…”

She suddenly slapped her palm at him. Yang Ye was about to take a step back, but he felt like the entire world had fallen silent!

A short moment later, Nether Maiden’s palm had struck his chest!

She hadn’t used any force!

She lifted her palm and said, “Reversion of time!”

Reversion of time!

Time!

Yang Ye was stunned and asked, “You can reverse time too?”

She raised a finger, “One breath of time, I can reverse a breath of time.”

Cold sweat immediately flowed from Yang Ye’s forehead!

Reversion of time!

What did that represent?

It represented that she would always be ahead of her enemies!

It was an absolutely heaven defying ability!

She sized up Yang Ye and said, “You’re much stronger too!”

Yang Ye smiled with embarrassment, “I’m weaker than you!”

She shook her head.

Yang Ye didn’t linger on this topic, “Do you have any information on the others?”

Nether Maiden shook her head.

Yang Ye nodded slightly, “It’s fine, I’ve sent people to locate them. They will rush over if they are found.”

Nether Maiden glanced at the surroundings, “How did you become the sect master here?”

Yang Ye laughed bitterly, “It’s a long story. Come on, let’s talk while we travel!”

They were friends since Profounder Continent who hadn’t seen each other in a long time. So, they had a lot to talk about. While Nether Maiden rarely spoke at most times, it was obvious that she was very happy!

Their calm life doesn’t last for long!

There was an ancient city outside the Ancient Sword Sect, and it was named, Ancient Sword City, after the sect!

It was the number one city under the sect, and the number one city in the West Region!

Because of the Soul Sect, the city was sealed, and entry was prohibited!

Many within the city had heard news of what was happening, so they left the city and went somewhere else.

Presently, there were very few in the city, just a few clans that were subordinate to the sect.

It was like an empty city!

A group of black robed figures appeared outside the city.

The figure in the lead held a spear, and there were ten others behind him. All of them had black hook-like weapons.

The black robed man with the spear suddenly leaped and appeared on the city walls. He could see the Ancient Sword Sect in the distance.

The black robed man greedily sucked in a deep breath, “Such a powerful soul!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he looked down at the city. While there were very few people in the city, there were quite a few still here.

The black robed man spoke indifferently, “Besides the members of our Soul Sect, you can absorb the souls of anyone in the West Region!”

As soon as he gave the order, the others behind him charged into the city. But ten rays of sword energy suddenly shot up into the air and obstructed their path!

It was those ten disciples of the Ancient Sword Sect!

The black robed man with the spear looked up into the distance, and there was a young sword cultivator there.

It was Yang Ye!

The black robed man raised his right hand and swung it down. The ten black robed figures immediately charged at those disciples of the Ancient Sword Sect.

A moment later, sword howls resounded incessantly.

The black robed man suddenly stretched out his right hand and gestured at Yang Ye to come at him.

Yang Ye pointed at the black robed man, “You’re so weak that I don’t have any interest in you.”

The black robed man laughed fiercely, “Is that so? You…”

Suddenly, two flying swords shot at him!

The black robed man’s reaction was very quick, and he immediately swung his spear out in a sweeping motion! It rumbled like a thunderclap!

Boom! Boom!

Along with two blasts of dazzling sparks, the black robed man was blasted away!

At the instant he was blasted away, his expression changed drastically beneath his robe, and then his eyes opened wide while his figure stiffened on the spot. It was because an invisible sword had pierced through his throat!

Blood sprayed toward the surroundings!

An instant kill!

However, he wasn’t really dead because his soul had escaped his body at the critical moment!

Moreover, not that he was without a body, the aura his soul emanated was even stronger than he’d been earlier!

His soul was stronger than his body! Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Yang Ye glanced at the black robed man’s soul and said, “Amazing! Your Soul Sect is really quite skilled to be able to cultivate the soul to such an extent!”

“Skilled?” The black robed man laughed coldly, “How ignorant! You actually think we’re just skilled? You…”

Suddenly, two flying swords shot at him like bolts of lightning!

The black robed man’s expression changed slightly. He was about to retreat, but Yang Ye suddenly vanished on the spot.

The Sword Domain!

The black robed man was shocked, and he stabbed his spear forward. He’d put his full strength into this attack!

Because he sensed danger!

Lethal danger!

Meanwhile, a sword stabbed against the spear.

Executor!

As soon as it touched the spear, the spear exploded apart, and then three swords pierced through the black robed man’s soul!

Bang!

The black robed man’s soul instantly exploded apart into countless pierces!

Yang Ye sheathed his sword!

He looked down below and was about to act when he suddenly looked off into the distance. The fragments of the black robed man’s soul were actually converging together once more!

The black robed man’s soul appeared before Yang Ye again! But it was slightly translucent!

Yang Ye frowned from the sight of this. What the heck is this?

The black robed man stared at Yang Ye with a trace of fear in his eyes!

Yang Ye suddenly looked down. The disciples of the Ancient Sword Sect had won the initial fight, but the experts of the Soul Sect couldn’t be killed. Just like the black robed man before him, they could converge and condense into form once more after having their souls blasted apart!

The black robed man laughed coldly, “You can’t kill us!”

Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly attacked once more. It was very fast and instantly pierced through the black robed man’s soul. The soul instantly exploded apart, but it only took a while for the soul to return to normal once more!

Of course, the black robed man’s soul was much more translucent!

This time, the fear in his eyes had transformed into terror!

They were naturally not invincible!

A short while later, the black robed man moved over 1km away and cracked a smile, “Sect Master Ye, we prepared a great gift for you! I hope you accept it with a smile!”

As soon as he finished speaking, an expanse of black clouds condensed in the sky above the city, and then gloomy gusts of wind appeared in the surroundings.

A formation!

The black robed man smiled, “Sect Master Ye, this is a formation that can even instantly kill a Lord Realm expert. We…”

Meanwhile, Yang Ye had withdrawn a seal!

The Universe Seal!

Yang Ye tossed it up, and then the surroundings returned to normal!

The black robed man was flabbergasted.

Yang Ye gazed at him, “A formation? I have Divine Treasures, do you?”
