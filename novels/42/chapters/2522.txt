Chapter 2523 – I Think We Can Talk About This!

Yang Ye arrived at the Sword Pavilion, and he was given access upon revealing his command token as an elite disciple.

The Sword Pavilion was huge, extremely huge. It was like a small city, and it exceeded his imagination. It didn’t take long for him to realize that it was an independent space.

A pocket space!

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings, and there were some obscure auras hidden in the surroundings. Obviously, they were all Divine Treasures!

Moreover, there were actually many of them, around 30, and that was just the ones he could sense!

Yang Ye was quite shocked that there were actually so many of them here!

“Don’t be shocked!” Suddenly, Sword Scroll’s voice resounded in his mind, “The Ancient Sword Sect has been in existence for countless years, and this is its resources and reserves.”

Yang Ye nodded slightly and realized what she meant.

After walking for a while, Yang Ye noticed that no Divine Treasure chose him, and it made him feel rather embarrassed!

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings and sighed with emotion. If Snowy was here, she could take all the Divine Treasures in here because she definitely had the ability to accomplish that!

Unfortunately, the little fellow was off having fun somewhere!

Sword Scroll suddenly said, “Go further in!”

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts and continued forward, and it didn’t take long for her voice to resound once more, “Right!”

Yang Ye looked over, but he saw nothing there!

She said, “Use the Sword Domain!”

Yang Ye nodded slightly and secretly sent it out. A moment later, he saw a sword!RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

An ethereal sword!

It was truly ethereal as if it was made from air!

Yang Ye’s eyes lit up when he saw it. It was very interesting to him!

Suddenly, the sword tried to flee, and Yang Ye hurriedly used the Sword Domain to suppress it. After that, he flicked a ray of sword energy to envelop it. Unexpectedly, the sword actually started resisting violently!

It refuses to give me face at all?

Yang Ye was stunned, and then he used the Seal of Suppression to suppress it. Moreover, he used the Universe Seal too.

Suddenly, a voice resounded, “Don’t break the rules!”

The rules!

Yang Ye was stunned, and then he suddenly recalled that he couldn’t use force in here!

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment, and then he put the seals away and dispersed the Sword Domain.

The sword instantly vanished without a trace!

Yang Ye shrugged and stopped trying to use force. He glanced at the surroundings and was about to leave when Sword Scroll suddenly said, “Wait a minute!”

Yang Ye stopped and was about to speak when he noticed that Sword Scroll was communicating with the sword.

Not long after, the sword suddenly flew over to Yang Ye and transformed into a ray of light that entered his forehead!

The sword had entered Yang Ye’s sea of consciousness!

Yang Ye was stunned, “What?”

Sword Scroll said, “I made a deal with it!”

Yang Ye asked, “What was it?”

Sword Scroll replied, “Help it become a Super Divine Treasure in 10 years!”

Yang Ye was stunned speechless.

Sword Scroll added, “Don’t worry, you can’t do it, but Snowy can. It will help you throughout these 10 years.”

Yang Ye chuckled and said, “Sword Scroll, can you make all the Divine Treasures here… You know…”

“Don’t even dream about it!” Sword Scroll spoke indifferently, “Do you really think they will let you take all of the Divine Treasures in here? Impossible! These are their resources, and every one they lose hurts for them. Don’t be greedy!”

Yang Ye smiled embarrassedly and left the hall. Meanwhile, a sigh resounded in the hall!

After he left the Sword Pavilion, Yang Ye didn’t immediately travel to the Sword Cave, he returned to his own abode instead. In the room, Yang Ye sat down cross-legged and entered the Primordial Pagoda.

Yang Ye summoned the sword in the pagoda!

Sword Scroll explained, “It’s Eternal Light, a sword left behind by an ancient expert of the Ancient Sword Sect. I’ve met it a few times in the past. Its special characteristic is its translucency. Simply speaking, it doesn’t cause spatial fluctuations as it moves through space. It’s truly traceless. If used with your Sword Gourd and Sword Domain, it would be absolutely elusive as a flying sword.”

Yang Ye nodded, and then he waved his right hand. Eternal Light instantly flew into the Sword Gourd.

He issued a command in his heart.

A cloud was sliced into two over 500 km away!

It had been accomplished soundlessly!

Yang Ye grinned because it was a really interesting sword. There hadn’t been a flash of light or any marks, not even a shred of aura. That was extremely terrifying!

If it was enhanced further with the Sword Domain, it would be even more terrifying!

Sword Scroll suddenly appeared beside Yang Ye and looked into the distance, “If this sword is combined with your Sword Domain… No, even if you don’t use the Sword Domain, it’s very likely to instantly kill Five World Realm experts with ease! Your strength and speed combined with the might of this sword is at a certain level. When strength and speed are at a certain level, the Laws and everything else comprehended by Five World Realm experts are useless.”

She gazed at Yang Ye and continued, “Remember that if someone’s strength far surpasses your own, your Sword Domain is useless too. Because it’s very likely for that person to kill you before you can even activate the Sword Domain!”

Yang Ye nodded. He naturally understood that. Moreover, even if he had the Sword Domain, he couldn’t underestimate anyone!

Once his Sword Domain was destroyed by force, the consequences were very, very severe!

After getting familiar with the sword, Yang Ye left the pagoda and headed to the Sword Cave.

The Sword Cave was situated deep within the mountains at the rear of the Ancient Sword Sect. It was called the Sword Cave, but it was actually a graveyard. Countless experts of the Ancient Sword Sect had gone to die there, and all of them had been extraordinary geniuses when they were alive!

Because normal people didn’t have the right to enter eternal sleep there!

Yang Ye hadn’t even gotten close to it when he sensed numerous divine senses sweep him, but they left upon noticing the command token hanging by his waist!

Obviously, they recognized his identity!

If he wasn’t an elite disciple, he would have probably been driven away!

It didn’t take long for Yang Ye to arrive at the entrance to a cave. The entrance was huge like the gates of a huge city!

An old man in a linen robe was at the entrance.

Yang Ye glanced at the old man, bowed slightly, and then walked toward the cave. Meanwhile, a sword suddenly floated before him, and then it descended and pointed itself at Yang Ye!

Yang Ye glanced at the old man, and then he withdrew his command token.

However, the sword remained there!

Yang Ye frowned slightly and gazed at the old man, “Senior, I’m an elite disciple!”

The old man turned his back to Yang Ye and remained silent!

Yang Ye withdrew his gaze and swung his sword.

Hiss!

As soon as it descended, the sword before him was blasted away. Meanwhile, the old man suddenly stood up.

Yang Ye glanced at the old man, and then he ignored the old man and walked toward the cave!

Since the old man didn’t give him any face, he planned to do the same!

Right when he was about to enter the cave, the old man tapped his finger forward.

Hiss!

A ray of light flashed, and a sword shot at Yang Ye’s forehead.

It was extremely fast to the point Yang Ye was almost unable to react to it!

Yang Ye’s expression remained calm as he issued a command in his heart, and a sword shot out from the Sword Gourd.

Bang!

A ray of dazzling light surged before Yang Ye, and then a sword was blasted away!

A wisp of surprise flashed through the old man’s eyes, “Interesting!”

Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly appeared before the old man and swung his sword!

The old man shook his head slightly, “You overestimate yourself!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he formed a seal with his fingers. In an instant, rays of sword energy locked onto the area around Yang Ye.

“The Sword Lock!” Meanwhile, Sword Scroll’s voice resounded in Yang Ye’s mind, “Do this. Stab forward with your right hand, then your left hand…”

Yang Ye didn’t doubt her. He just did as she told him…

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!

As he did that, the sword energy that locked the area around him instantly vanished without a trace. Moreover, the old man was even pushed back around 100m!

“Impossible!” The old man gazed at him with astonishment, “How could you possibly break through my Sword Lock technique?! That’s…”

The old man’s voice stopped abruptly because Yang Ye was in front of him, and then a sword slashed down at the old man. At the same time, two swords shot out from Yang Ye’s waist!

Yang Ye didn’t use Eternal Light because he was afraid the old man would fail to defend himself and die from it!

He was allowed to fight here and cause trouble, but if he killed someone here, then it would be difficult to deal with! Moreover, the old man didn’t have any desire to kill him!

A wisp of surprise flashed through the old man’s eyes when he saw the flying swords, but his reaction wasn’t slow at all. He tapped his finger forward repeatedly.

Hiss! Hiss!

Yang Ye and his swords were blasted over 300m away by a strand of powerful sword energy!

Yang Ye was about to attack again when the old man clawed at him.

A sword howl resounded around Yang Ye, and then countless energy swords appeared in the space around him. They overlapped together with their tips pointing at him!

Moreover, there was a strand of powerful sword energy that was suppressing Yang Ye’s location!

Yang Ye hurriedly asked, “How do I deal with this?”

A short while passed before Sword Scroll replied indifferently, “You can’t. It exceeds the scope of your strength, unless you use the Sword Domain.”

Yang Ye blinked, put his sword away, and gazed at the old man, “Senior, I think we can talk about this!”

The old man was stunned speechless.
