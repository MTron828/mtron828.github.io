Chapter 1841 – Pure Violence!

At this moment, Yang Ye was quite stunned!

His attack had blasted Qiong Qi 3km back and even heavily injured Qiong Qi. But he still didn’t understand why that had happened.

So, he gazed at Hou Qing.

Hou Qing explained, “Qiong Qi’s strength is physical strength. Let me explain it like this. Doesn’t an ordinary person have to rely on pushing against the ground to jump?”

Yang Ye nodded.

Hou Qing continued, “As for us, cultivators, we don’t have to rely on pushing against the ground. However, we have to rely on space. When Qiong Qi slammed himself at you, he relied on pushing against space, and the energy created when he moved through space. But your attack destroyed the space which provided him the push and energy. Simply speaking, you removed all the energy acting upon him. So, he was at his weakest. Understand?”

Yang Ye naturally understood it when Hou Qing explained it like that!

Yang Ye became quite excited.

It was a true way to destroy all techniques with a single attack because it destroyed the source of a person’s energy and force! As for the technique he used in the past, it wasn’t right at all!

Meanwhile, Hou Qing gazed at Yang Ye, “Actually, you’ve learned much faster than I expected. Even a genius would take over a dozen years to control strength to such an extent, and it would still take two or three years with the guidance of someone. But you only took a few months!”

He glanced at Yang Ye and continued, “However, it’s normal. Because you possess the Spatial Laws, and your attainments in the Sword Dao are extremely advanced. Of course, the most important factor is that you have an extraordinary expert like me to guide you!”

Yang Ye felt speechless.

Hou Qing said, “Now that you’ve learned how to do that, it’s time to learn how to crush all things with absolute strength!”

He gazed at Qiong Qi.

Qiong Qi gazed at Yang Ye. At this moment, there was a malicious smile on Yang Ye’s face. Yang Ye hurriedly withdrew the smile when he saw Qiong Qi look at him.

Qiong Qi said, “Kid, let’s continue our training once you get to the large universe!”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

Meanwhile, Qiong Qi vanished on the spot, and then a wave of powerful force slammed down at Yang Ye.

At the same time, Hou Qing’s voice suddenly resounded in Yang Ye’s ear, “Treat the space before you as a rock! Use your sword to stab it.”

Yang Ye hurriedly nodded, and then he gazed at the space before him. A moment later, he stabbed his sword forward.

The limits of his strength!

As soon as his sword stabbed forward, the space before him shook violently, and then the energy Qiong Qi emanated dispersed without a trace. At the same time, Qiong Qi’s enormous figure was blasted away.

After flying for over 6km, Qiong Qi’s figure flew in a beautiful arc as it slammed to the ground.

Boom!

The entire ground shook violently like an earthquake was surging through it.

Yang Ye was stunned once more. When did I become so strong?

Meanwhile, Hou Qing explained, “Strength. Your attack stabbed space, but it wasn’t space that endured the force of it, it was Qiong Qi who was within that expanse of space. The unique aspect of it is that not a shred of the strength within it is leaked or wasted. All of it struck Qiong Qi. In the past, you just swung your sword at random, so most of the energy within it was endured by space. So, you always tear space open when you attacked in the past. But this time, space didn’t tear open, and it was Qiong Qi who was torn open!”

I see! At this moment, Yang Ye had come to an understanding.

Meanwhile, Hou Qing continued, “Actually, these moves I taught you are usually gradually comprehended after others attain the Enlightened Realm. Yet now, you’ve comprehended it in advance with my guidance. However, it doesn’t represent that you can fight Enlightened Realm experts. Not to mention fighting them, you still can’t even fight that fellow, the Night Emperor!”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Why?”

“Stop asking stupid questions!” Hou Qing continued, “Do you think he lived the last tens of thousands of years doing nothing? His cultivation is higher than yours, and his attainments in all aspects are greater than yours as well. If you didn’t possess the Sword Domain, he would have killed you in a moment.”

The Sword Domain! Yang Ye suddenly thought of a very serious problem when he heard those words. His lifespan! He’d almost fully exhausted his lifespan while using the Sword Domain to fight the Night Emperor… Now, he only had less than a year to live!

He’d forgotten about it because he’d been training! Fortunately, he had Lifespan Fruits, and the lifespan they provided would be sufficient for him to attain the 3rd stage of the True Realm.

Meanwhile, Hou Qing added, “You should avoid using that thing or just don’t use it at all. Otherwise, you might just die one day!”

Yang Ye replied, “I only know how to use it defensively, and I don’t know how to use it offensively. Do you know how?”

Hou Qing shook his head, “I don’t. But even if I did, it’s best if you don’t. The price you pay is too heavy.”

Yang Ye laughed bitterly, “Then isn’t it useless?”

“Useless?” Hou Qing shook his head slightly, “You call that useless? You have to realize that if it wasn’t for the Sword Domain, you would be dead by now. Unfortunately, while it allowed you to become invincible and survive the battle with the Night Emperor, the price you paid was too heavy.”

Yang Ye nodded. Presently, he shouldn’t be thinking about the Sword Domain, and he should be thinking about how he should improve his strength and cultivation. Especially his cultivation because a year would pass in the blink of an eye for him!

Once his lifespan was exhausted, even the Primordial Pagoda wouldn’t be able to save him!

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts and gazed at Hou Qing, “Senior, are we going to learn shaman techniques now?”

Hou Qing replied, “Shaman techniques? You haven’t even finished learning how to control your strength. You think you’re ready for shaman techniques?”

Yang Ye was astounded, “It isn’t over?”

Hou Qing replied, “Of course not. It’s just the beginning! Now, let’s leave the Primordial Pagoda and look for a dead planet.”

Yang Ye asked without thinking, “Why?”

Hou Qing floated over to Yang Ye, “From now on, just do as I say. If I don’t tell you to ask questions, then don’t ask. Understand?”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

Yang Ye would naturally not try to fight back. He was no fool. So, he immediately left the Primordial Pagoda.

Blind Maiden was still standing on guard outside the cave.

She spoke softly, “You’re leaving?”

Yang Ye nodded, “I’m going somewhere else, Third Sister.”

Blind Maiden turned around to face him, “Not to take revenge?”

Yang Ye replied, “No.”

She ‘gazed’ at him for a long time before she said, “Do you need me to come with you?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “I’ll be fine by myself.”

Blind Maiden replied, “Alright, be careful.”

As soon as she finished speaking, she turned around and left. Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly said, “Third Sister, let me avenge Second Sister, alright?”

Blind Maiden stopped, fell silent for a long time, and nodded, “Alright!”

Her figure vanished on the spot once she finished speaking!

After Blind Maiden left, Yang Ye left the cave.

He glanced at the surroundings. He was still within the scope of Heaven Pillar Mountain. He took a deep breath, and then a ray of light flashed and vanished into the distance.

He was off to search for a dead planet!

It didn’t take long for Yang Ye to leave Heaven Pillar Mountain and enter the boundless starry sky. The medium universe was huge, so there were numerous planets which were still alive. But there were similarly many that were dead.

Around four hours later, Yang Ye finally found a dead planet in the boundless reaches of space.

It was an abandoned planet, and it was completely devoid of spirit energy.

Yang Ye stood on the spot, glanced at the surroundings, and then closed his eyes, “Senior Hou Qing, what are we going to do here?”

Hou Qing replied, “Destroy!”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Destroy?”

Hou Qing explained, “Your control over your physical strength has arrived at an acceptable standard. Now, I’m going to teach you another method of controlling your strength. It’s called Overwhelming Strength! It represents paying no attention to technique and just using pure strength, pure violence!”

Pure strength! Pure violence!

Yang Ye’s blood started to boil slightly.

Meanwhile, Hou Qing said, “Now, you’re prohibited from using your sword. Use your fists. Start punching from here until you blast this entire planet into bits.”

Yang Ye was stunned. Quite some time passed before he gulped and asked, “Senior, are you serious? Blast it into bits with my fists?”

Hou Qing asked, “Is it very difficult?”

Yang Ye nodded honestly. If he used sword energy, he was slightly confident in his ability to accomplish that, but if he were to use his fists…

Meanwhile, Hou Qing suddenly said, “If Qiong Qi or my main body wanted to destroy a planet, we could accomplish it in an instant. Your current physical strength is similar to what I possessed all those years ago, so why can’t you?”

Yang Ye fell silent.

Right! If Hou Qing can accomplish it, then why can’t I? DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Why do I keep underestimating myself?

How do I know I can’t do it if I don’t try?

Yang Ye said, “Can I use the Wargod’s arm?”

“Yes!” Hou Qing replied, “Now, you must fully master its strength. Or I should say that you must fully unearth its potential. So, smash away!”

Yang Ye took a deep breath and started slamming his fists against the ground.

Boom!

The entire ground shook violently, and then a huge fissure appeared. After the first appeared, there was a second, and then a third…

In the Primordial Pagoda.

Qiong Qi stood in front of Hou Qing as he asked, “Why don’t you teach him how?”

Hou Qing replied, “Comprehension. He has to comprehend it himself. Only then will it truly belong to him. He will never forget it if he comprehends it himself.”

Qiong Qi glanced at Hou Qing, “You’re very good at teaching others!”

Hou Qing shook his head, “The Shaman King taught this to us a long time ago.”

The Shaman King!

Qiong Qi’s gaze instantly became solemn when he heard that name.

Outside the Primordial Pagoda.

Yang Ye was still slamming his fists against the ground. Over and over again.

Once he felt exhausted, Hou Qing would immediately make Snowy create a violet colored crystal for Yang Ye to consume, and then Yang Ye would continue once he recovered…

Punching the planet like a madman!
