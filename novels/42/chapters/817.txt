Besides Li Qingyi, Fan Li and the others weren’t able to catch sight of it because it was truly too swift!

At this moment, the calm and composed expression on Li Qingyi’s face had vanished. She gazed at Yang Ye with disbelief while her heart roiled like boiling water.

Lin Ning was still scolding Yang Ye. But as he scolded and scolded, he suddenly realized that everyone was looking at him. So, he stopped and glanced at the others. He was just about to say something when he suddenly looked at his left arm with shock. At this moment, his newly grown left arm had actually fallen to the ground.

“AH!!” A shrill and miserable cry resounded through the quiet basin, and it caused ripples to surge through it.

Fan Meng’s mouth opened wide when she witnessed this scene. She knew that Yang Ye was definitely very strong, but she hadn’t imagined that he was actually strong to such an extent!

Lin Ning is an Exalt Realm expert!But he couldn’t even dodge a single attack from him?

Fan Meng couldn’t help but be flabbergasted. Even Li Qingyi, Fan Li, and Yu Lang were stunned.

Yang Ye paid no attention to the others. He walked towards Fan Li and said, “Give the sheath back to me!”

Fan Li recovered from her shock, and then she flipped her palm, causing a whip to appear in her grasp. The profound energy within her surged as she shouted, “Who are you!?”

It wasn’t just Fan Li, even Li Qingyi and Yu Lang’s profound energy had started to surge. They were on guard and prepared to attack at any moment.

Yang Ye continued walking towards Fan Li and said, “That isn’t important. I just want my sword sheath back. Give it back and I’ll leave right now.”

A cold glow flashed through Fan Li’s eyes. Suddenly, the whip in her hand crackled through the air as it shot towards Yang Ye. However, it hadn’t even arrived in front of Yang Ye when it was slashed into half by a ray of light. Fan Li was horrified.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye was in front of her, and then she felt sharp pain come from her stomach before her figure was blasted flying.

Bang!

Fan Li smashed against a tree and crashed to the ground, causing the entire ground there to tremble.

Li Qingyi and Yu Lang’s expressions changed. They were about to act when Yang Ye suddenly looked at them, and he said, “Move and you die!”

“How dare you....” Yu Lang roared furiously and was about to attack. Suddenly, a ray of light flashed, and then Yu Lang’s figure stiffened on the spot. An instant later, his head was pushed into the air by a fountain of blood.

Li Qingyi’s pupils constricted, and she was stunned on the spot.

“Who exactly are you!?” Meanwhile, Fan Li had stood up and was staring fixedly at Yang Ye. Yang Ye didn’t answer her. He took a step forward, and merely this step allowed him to instantly arrive in front of Fan Li. After that, Fan Li felt something press down on her throat, and she was almost suffocated.

“Yang Ye....” Fan Meng was horrified when she witnessed this scene, and she quickly called out to him.

Yang Ye’s figure stopped moving. He pondered deeply for an instant, and then he slowly let go of her. He gazed at Fan Li and shook his head, “The reason you’re still alive now isn’t because you’re beautiful, and it isn’t because you’re smart either. It’s because you have a naïve little sister. I don’t want to waste my breath on you. Hand the sheath over. Otherwise, I don’t mind searching your corpse!”

Fan Meng quickly ran over to Fan Li, supported her up, and said, “Big Sister, that sword sheath is his. Just... just give it back to him. Otherwise... he’ll really kill you!” As she spoke, there was a trace of fear in her eyes as she gazed at Yang Ye! She hadn’t expected that this man who seemed so gentle and amiable would actually be so ruthless when he fought!

Fan Li raised her head to look at Yang Ye, but Yang Ye didn’t look at her. He looked towards the depths of the forest instead. This time, Fan Li didn’t hesitate to flip her palm, and the ancient sheath appeared there.

Yang Ye withdrew his gaze from the forest, made a gesture, and the sword sheath returned into his grasp. There was a trace of pain and complicated emotions in his eyes as he gazed at the sword sheath. He knew that the Sword Spirit had definitely fallen into deep sleep because he executed Heavenrend, and the only way to awaken her was to feed his sword intent to her. Unfortunately, his current sword intent was only at the 1st level!

Looks like I have to think about how to recover my sword intent! Yang Ye held the ancient sheath in his hand as he turned around and walked away. However, he merely took a few steps before he suddenly stopped walking.

The expressions on the faces of Fan Li, Li Qingyi, and Lin Ning who was howling on the ground changed drastically when they saw him stop.

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings, and then he turned to look at Fan Meng, “It’s very dangerous here. Staying with them is equivalent to walking on a path towards death. If you are willing, you can leave with me. I’ll take you out of this mountain range.”

Fan Meng was first delighted, but it didn’t take long for the happiness on her face to vanish. She glanced at her older sister and said, “Can... can you take my big sister as well?”

Yang Ye shook his head. While his strength had recovered to the King Realm, and he could even defeat some Exalt Realm experts. However, he wasn’t invincible. If he were to be surrounded by an army of demon beasts, then even if they couldn’t kill him, they could exhaust him to death. Moreover, he didn’t have a good impression of Fan Li at all. So, why would he waste his time and energy to save her? He wasn’t stupid!

“I don’t need him!” Fan Li stared fixedly at Yang Ye, and her eyes had killing intent within them.

Bang!

Fan Li had just finished speaking when her figure was blasted flying, and she only stopped flying after breaking numerous trees.

“You’re courting death!” Fan Li had a ferocious expression on her face when she stood up, and the profound energy within her surged madly, causing a powerful aura to sweep out from her. After that, she swiftly swung her whip at Yang Ye!

“Heaven Ravager!” The whip was like an enormous dragon, and it was nimble like a snake as it tore through the sky and shook the space around it!

Fan Meng’s face turned pale with fright. Because it was a Dao Rank technique. It was the Fan Clan’s strongest technique!

However, a ray of light suddenly flashed. It was extremely tiny when compared to the whip, but when the sword energy came into contact with the whip, it unexpectedly crushed the aura on the whip and immediately sliced it into half!

But the sword energy didn’t disperse. It instantly arrived before Fan Li who was beyond shocked!

“NO!!!” Fan Meng’s face turned ghastly pale while terror filled her eyes. As soon as her voice resounded, the sword energy which was about to shoot through Fan Li’s forehead suddenly stopped!

Li Qingyi’s pupils constricted into the size of needles when she witnessed this scene, and her hands couldn’t help but tremble. While Yang Ye’s sword energy wasn’t enhanced by sword intent, such a scene shocked her to the extreme! Because Yang Ye was actually able to control sword energy which had left him. One had to attain the 9th level of sword intent and gain material sword intent at the very least in order to be able to accomplish that. But Yang Ye’s sword energy didn’t carry a trace of sword intent!

So what did that prove?

It proved that this fellow before her, Yang Ye, had concealed his strength!

The 9th level of Sword Intent! There might not be a single person with such sword intent anywhere near here! After she recovered from her shock, all sorts of thoughts appeared in Li Qingyi’s mind, and a blazing expression of desire appeared in her eyes.

At this moment, Fan Li’s shock wasn’t much lesser than Li Qingyi. She hadn’t imagined that her strongest attack would be so weak before this fellow who she called a servant of her clan!

Fan Meng stood in front of that strand of sword energy, and she gazed at Yang Ye as she said, “I know that my big sister’s attitude towards you wasn’t good, but she did that for my sake. Yang Ye, if... if you really want to vent. Then... then kill me....”

“Vent?” Yang Ye shook his head and said, “To be honest, she isn’t even qualified to make me angry.” When he spoke up to this point, he gazed at Fan Li who was glaring angrily at him, “Don’t look at me with such a murderous gaze. Because people have done that to me in the past, and their corpses have been transformed into dirt by now!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he turned around and walked away with the ancient sheath in his grasp.

“Please wait a moment!” Suddenly, Li Qingyi cried out to him.

Yang Ye stopped moving, turned around to look at her, and then he said, “What?”

“You’re from the Ancient Sword School, right?” Li Qingyi’s eyes had slight excitement in them.

Yang Ye frowned and said, “Speak about what you want!”

She was overjoyed when she saw him tacitly admit it, “Brother Yang, I mainly came here to this mountain range for a single thing. So long as Brother Yang lends me a hand, then I’m willing to provide a generous reward!”

“What? I’ve become ‘Brother Yang’ now? I’m not that servant anymore?” Yang Ye spoke indifferently.

Li Qingyi wasn’t infuriated by his ridicule. She smiled and said, “Status naturally changes according to one’s strength. I was ignorant earlier and wasn’t able to recognize Brother Yang’s ability. I apologize!”

Yang Ye waved his hand and said, “There’s no need for apologies. Out of consideration for Little Meng, I’ll give you a piece of advice. Leave right now and perhaps you’ll still be in time. Otherwise, you won’t be able to leave even if you want to!”

Li Qingyi’s expression changed slightly, and she said, “Brother Yang, have you noticed something?”

Yang Ye didn’t speak. He just walked forward with the ancient sheath in hand.

Meanwhile, Li Qingyi spoke once more, “Brother Yang, even if you don’t care about Young Miss Fan, Young Master Li, and I, but Brother Yang wouldn’t just disregard Young Miss Fan Meng as well, right?”

Yang Ye stopped when he heard this. Li Qingyi instantly heaved a sigh of relief when she saw him stop, and she glanced at Fan Meng, It’s all thanks to that little girl!

Yang Ye turned around to gaze at Fan Meng. Meanwhile, Fan Meng glanced at him before she slowly lowered her head. Yang Ye sighed softly, and then he flashed over to Fan Meng.

Fan Li’s expression changed, and she took a step forward and stood in front of Fan Meng. She hadn’t even spoken a word when a strand of sword energy was pressing against the center of her forehead, and a droplet of blood slowly seeped out from there!

“Fuck off!” Yang Ye glanced coldly at her.

Fan Li’s face twitched. She was about to speak when Fan Meng pulled Fan Li behind her, and then she gazed at Yang Ye, “You... you leave on your own. I can’t abandon my big sister!” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Yang Ye withdrew his sword energy, and then he rubbed Fan Meng’s head, “She’s so fierce to you. What are you being so good to her?”

Fan Meng shook her head, “Big Sister has had a tough life. She has done too much for the Fan Clan and me. You... you can leave on your own. I can’t burden you!”

Yang Ye shook his head, “It’s too late to leave now!” As he spoke, his gaze gradually became solemn.

Roar!

Suddenly, the furious roar of a beast resounded through the night sky, and then countless roars of fury resounded incessantly!

Rumble!

The forest around them suddenly started to shake!
