Chapter 1251 – Head Snatch!

“Repeat myself? No! I’ll prove it to you!” As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye waved his right hand, and the beams of light shattered into pieces. After that, he instantly put away all the treasures within them before looking at the white robed young man, “See, they all belong to me.” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

The white robed young man gazed at Yang Ye and said, “Are you sure?”

Yang Ye gazed at him for a few breaths of time, and then a sword suddenly appeared in his grasp before he vanished on the spot.

Om!

Along with a sudden sword howl, a ray of light flashed through the air.

When battle couldn’t be avoided, Yang Ye chose to launch the 1st attack!

At this moment, it was naturally impossible to avoid battle. As for reasoning with them and saying that first come first serve?

He was no fool and would naturally not seek insult.

Yang Ye didn’t hold back and immediately executed the ultimate version of Death by a Thought. There wasn’t much distance between them and coupled with the fact that Yang Ye launched a surprise attack, the white robed young man hadn’t even been able to recover from his shock before Yang Ye’s sword stabbed against the center of his forehead.

However, Yang Ye’s expression changed when his sword stabbed against the center of the young man’s forehead, because a palm-sized shield had suddenly appeared there. The Quasi Emperor Rank sword in his gras instantly trembled and cracked apart upon stabbing against the shield. At the same time, a powerful wave of force swept out from the shield and moved along his sword before slamming against his body.

Bang!

A muffled explosion resounded as Yang Ye moved backwards repeatedly. When he arrived around 30m back, he stomped his right foot towards the ground behind him and instantly stopped his figure from moving further back. Meanwhile, he glanced at his slightly numb arm before looking at the center of the white robed man’s forehead. At this moment, the tiny shield had vanished.

A Void Rank defensive treasure!

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly. Only a Void Rank defensive treasure could resist Death by a Thought with such ease and even cause cracks to appear on a Quasi Emperor Rank sword.

“A sword cultivator?” The white robed man’s gaze descended onto Yang Ye, and he frowned, “You’re a sword cultivator from the outside world! Impossible! No sword cultivator would dare to come here! You....” His frown grew even deeper at this point, “That formation outside could even kill Voiders, yet it has been destroyed. It’s impossible for you to destroy it with the strength you possess. So, who exactly are you? How did you get in here?”

It can even kill Voiders? Yang Ye frowned. Even though the formation had been strong, it was impossible for it to kill Voiders. But it didn’t take long for Yang Ye to figure it out. The Sword God’s Seal could enhance sword intent. While the sword intent within the sword formation had been at the Rebirth Rank when he faced it earlier, it hadn’t been Quasi Returnal Rank sword intent!

If the Sword God’s Seal had enhanced the sword intent there to the Quasi Returnal Rank, then he would have been absolutely incapable of resisting it. After all, if it was Quasi Returnal Rank sword intent, over 10,000 Quasi Emperor Rank swords, and that formation, then it really wouldn’t be difficult for it to kill a Voider! Yang Ye felt that it was probably the reason why Sword God’s Palace still hadn’t been completely plundered until now!

After he figured it out, Yang Ye restrained his thoughts and looked up at the pair before him. The old man was standing at the side with his eyes slightly closed, and it seemed like he’d entered into a meditative state. If one didn’t look at him, one wouldn’t notice that a person was there. Because divine sense couldn’t detect his presence at all.

Yang Ye’s gaze paused on the old man for a while, and then he turned to look at the white robed young man. Meanwhile, Yun Banqing walked over to Yang Ye side and spoke softly, “The Yuan Clan is the number one power in the human race of the Veiled Region. He’s its young master, Yuan Qiubai, and his strength can be ranked in the top 3 of the Veiled Region’s younger generation. He’s extremely strong. Be careful.”

The Yuan Clan! Yang Ye nodded lightly. He didn’t waste his breath on the man and immediately vanished on the spot again. His figure was before Yuan Qiubai when it appeared once more, and he swung his sword forward.

A cold glow flashed through Yuan Qiubai’s eyes when he saw Yang Ye attack without saying a word, and then a silver spear appeared in his grasp. He twisted his wrist, and the silver spear stabbed forward swiftly.

It was like a dragon surging forward!

The spear and sword collided!

Bang!

A rumbling explosion resounded abruptly as the space around Yang Ye and the white robed man shook violently before both were pushed backwards. It didn’t take long for Yang Ye to stop moving, but the white robed young man was still moving backwards and only stopped after moving another 100m back.

\

Meanwhile, the old man glanced at Yang Ye but didn’t attack.

Yuan Qiubai’s face was completely gloomy. He glanced at his slightly numb hand before looking up at Yang Ye, “You really surprised me quite a bit. But it would only be interesting like this.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yuan Qiubai’s spear transformed into a ray of silver light that shot forward at extreme speed, and it instantly arrived before Yang Ye. But Yang Ye’s expression remained unchanged. He’d intended to swing his sword forward, but he suddenly recalled what the green robed man had said. So, he pondered deeply for a moment before starting to stare fixedly at the spear. Yang Ye’s hand moved when the spear was about to stab the center of his forehead.

His sword struck a point on the spear’s body. In an instant, the silver light it emanated was dispersed, and the spear itself even seemed like its weak point had been struck and just fell to the ground. Meanwhile Yuan Qiubai was stunned when he witnessed this scene from afar. He hadn’t expected that his attack would have actually been stopped with such ease!

A smile curled up on the corners of Yang Ye’s mouth. The Enlightened Sword Heart! He’d gained the Enlightened Sword Heart a very long time ago, but from some moment in time, he’d actually overlooked that advantage of his. Just as the green robed man had said, every technique and move had flaws. So long as he could locate those flaws, then he could overcome them with the smallest amount of strength!

But from some moment in time, he’d become fond of brute force. No matter who his enemy was, he would just swing his sword at them.... Of course, it was effective. Because very few could compete with him when it came to physical strength and speed. However, once he encountered a true expert, like the green robed man.... Under the circumstances that it wasn’t suitable to utilize profound energy and sword intent, he was practically incapable of fighting back!

At this moment, Yang Ye felt quite regretful. He regretted not constantly practicing with this advantage he possessed. After all, such abilities naturally required practice. The green robed man and him could both locate the flaws in the attacks of others, but he was far inferior when compared to the green robed man!

Of course, being able to destroy all techniques with a single attack didn’t equal invincibility. If he encountered a formidable opponent like An Nanjing who was a genius with extraordinary combat instinct, then it might not be effective against her. Besides that, if his opponent’s attacks were too swift, he would be helpless against it as well. Because even if he could detect the flaws in the attack, he couldn’t take hold of that flaw if his opponent’s speed exceeded his ability!

Another situation was when his opponent’s strength was too great. Such opponents would be able to crush everything with pure strength, so techniques and skill would be useless regardless of how great they were!

So, even if he possessed the Enlightened Sword Heart, it still had to be supported by his speed and strength in order to accomplish the feat of crushing all techniques with a single attack.

“The ability to crush all techniques with a single attack!” Meanwhile, Yuan Qiubai spoke abruptly, “How interesting! It’s getting more and more interesting! Come try and deal with this!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yuan Qiubai vanished on the spot.

Yang Ye frowned because Yuan Qiubai’s speed had suddenly risen explosively! This time, Yang Ye didn’t look with his eyes because his eyes couldn’t keep up with Yuan Qiubai’s speed. Yang Ye closed his eyes, and a moment of silence ensued before his hand moved once more. A ray of light flashed....

Clang!

The sound of metal colliding resounded abruptly, and then Yun Banqing watched with shock as Yuan Qiubai was pushed back repeatedly.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly opened his eyes and gazed at Yuan Qiubai. Yuan Qiubai’s speed was very swift indeed, but his own speed was much swifter. Unless Yuan Qiubai’s speed and strength surpassed him, he would be able to crush all of Yuan Qiubai’s attacks!

It was the 2nd time today that Yang Ye noticed how extraordinary the Enlightened Sword Heart was!

The 1st time was naturally during the battle between him and the green robed man.

A slight smile curled up on the corners of Yang Ye’s face as he glanced at the sword in his grasp, and then he looked at Yuan Qiubai, “Again!”

Yang Ye vanished on the spot.

Yuan Qiubai’s eyes narrowed slightly while a cold glow flickered within them. He roared with fury as the spear in his grasp created countless spear images that enveloped down upon Yang Ye.

“Crush!” A ray of light flashed along with his voice, and then the spear imagines vanished while Yuan Qiubai was blasted backwards repeatedly.

Meanwhile, the old man’s eyes narrowed.

Yang Ye didn’t stop and continued his charge towards the white robed young man. He didn’t execute any techniques and just utilized ordinary swings, stabs, and flicks of the sword. However, it was exactly such moves which repeatedly repulsed a Quasi Emperor like Yuan Qiubai to the point he couldn’t fight back at all.

The current battle was simply similar to the scene during the battle between Yang Ye and the green robed man.

After fighting for a while, Yang Ye suddenly stopped and looked at Yuan Qiubai, “Why don’t you ask your senior to help you? You will die if this continues!”

“There’s no need to egg me on!” Yuan Qiubai spoke with a gloomy expression, “Don’t worry, he won’t interfere. Kill me if you can!”

Yang Ye didn’t really believe him and said, “He really won’t?”

Yuan Qiubai turned to look at the old man, “Elder Lin, don’t interfere!”

The old man said, “That fellow is very strong!”

Yuan Qiubai laughed coldly, “He is. But only then would it be interesting. Elder Lin, just watch and don’t interfere!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yuan Qiubai vanished on the spot.

“Then I won’t hold back!” Yang Ye’s figure vanished on the spot as well.

A moment of silence ensued before a loud explosion resounded. It didn’t take long for the glow of the spear and sword to be dispersed. This time, Yang Ye had been pushed back, and he’d only been able to stop after moving almost 300m back.

“Hahaha!” Yuan Qiubai pointed at the small shield at the center of his forehead and said, “I’m invincible with this treasure in my possession. How can you fight me?”

Yang Ye glanced at the small shield before a slightly strange smile curled up on the corners of his mouth, “Is that so?”

“Is it not so?” A cold smile appeared on the corners of Yuan Qiubai’s mouth, “It can even stop Void Rank techniques, let alone your lousy moves?”

Yang Ye suddenly said, “Can it defend you from the inside?”

Yuan Qiubai frowned, “What are you trying to say?”

Yang Ye suddenly stretched out his hand in Yuan Qiubai’s direction, “Head Snatch!”

As soon as Yang Ye finished speaking, Yuan Qiubai was stunned, and then a moment passed before his eyes suddenly opened wide. He howled, “Elder Lin! Save me!”
