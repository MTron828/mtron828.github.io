Chapter 2201 – I’m Willing to Accept You as My Master!

Everyone here fell extremely silent as they gazed at Yang Ye’s figure.

Yang Lianshuang glanced at the young man’s corpse. At this moment, she really got to witness what it was like to court death.

Yang Lianshuang shook her head and gazed at the others here, “Remember that he doesn’t have any responsibility to save all of you, nor does he have any responsibility for your futures. If any of you still think that he should save the human race, then allow me to be honest, that person who just died won’t be the last one.”

They still hadn’t realized what Yang Ye’s attitude toward the human race was!

Did Yang Ye care about the human race?

Obviously, he didn’t!

Perhaps Yang Ye had thought about saving the human race in the past, but he didn’t have such a thought anymore.

Could anyone save the human race as it was now?

The human race’s enemies didn’t just come from the outside, it came from the inside too.

But that young man had blamed Yang Ye for the current state that the human race was in. It wasn’t just the young man, many others here had similar thoughts. They felt that Yang Ye’s lack of action was one of the main reasons that the human race had fallen into its current state!

Everyone was selfish!

It was like how when a poor person suddenly became a millionaire, and then that person’s relatives would come asking for money. As for their reason, it would be extremely weird, like ‘You’re rich, so why can’t you lend me some?’, or ‘You’re so rich, so why can’t you give me some?’. Moreover, if they were asked to repay the money they borrowed, they would talk bad about the person and complain about that person’s request for the money to be repaid because that person was so rich already…

Now, these people felt that since Yang Ye was strong, he should save the human race, help the human race, and fight for the human race!

Yang Lianshuang turned around and was about to leave. But a young girl suddenly walked over to her, causing Yang Lianshuang to stop.

The young girl looked up at Yang Lianshuang, “Yesterday, I had a very, very good friend, Xiao Mei. But she was dead when I woke up today. Her entire family was dead.”

Yang Lianshuang fell silent.

The young girl continued, “Xiao Mei wouldn’t have died if Big Brother was there, right?”

Yang Lianshuang rubbed the young girl’s head, “Do you know that he lost many friends?”

The young girl suddenly grabbed Yang Lianshuang’s dress, “Big Sis, but if this continues, even more will die. So, please persuade him to help the human race, alright? Maybe just one word from him can save so many people.”

Yang Lianshuang fell silent.

Meanwhile, the young girl withdrew two immortal crystals from her pocket and raised them before Yang Lianshuang, “T-This is what mother gave me when she died. I-I can give it all to Big Brother.”

Yang Lianshuang’s eyes were slightly moist as she gazed at the young girl.

Yang Lianshuang turned around, and Yang Ye had suddenly appeared there. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

The young girl gazed at Yang Ye. Obviously, she was quite afraid, so she moved closer to Yang Lianshuang. But it didn’t take long for her to muster up the courage to go to Yang Ye, and then she raised those two immortal crystals before him, “Big Brother, t-this is everything I have.”

The other humans here suddenly went closer to Yang Ye, and it didn’t take long for all of them to place their immortal crystals before Yang Ye.

Meanwhile, an old man walked over to Yang Ye and knelt down slowly. Once the old man did that, countless others did the same.

Begging!

Perhaps it was because of the young girl’s actions that moved them, but all of them had a single thought right now, and it was a desire for the human race to be safe!

People died with their countries!

If the human race was annihilated, even if they did survive, they would be refugees!

Refugees!

They hadn’t experienced it for themselves, but they’d seen how it was.

No one wanted to become a refugee. Yet now, only Yang Ye could save the human race.

Yang Ye fell silent.

Yang Lianshuang stood by his side, and she gazed at him in silence.

Yang Ye didn’t take the young girl’s immortal crystals. He gazed at Yang Lianshuang and said, “Come with me, I have something to discuss with you!”

He turned around and left once he finished speaking.

Everyone here had bitter expressions on their faces when they witnessed this.

Yang Lianshuang sighed softly and followed Yang Ye.

At an empty place, Yang Ye stopped and said, “A new force called the undying race has shown themselves. Their location is the prehistoric ruins. You can investigate their background, but don’t send anyone to the prehistoric ruins. It’s dangerous.”

“The undying race?” She frowned, “You’ve come into contact with them?”

Yang Ye nodded, “Yes. Be careful. But don’t offend them for now. They are mysterious and very strong.”

Yang Lianshuang nodded, “I will.”

She paused for a moment at this point and continued, “Are you really not going to help the human race?”

Yang Ye gazed at her, “What are you trying to say?”

Yang Lianshuang laughed bitterly, “Do you know how many people have died? At least 40% of the human race! 40%! Even though many of them died due to fighting amongst themselves, most of them were killed by outsiders! The human race is in a very miserable state right now!”

Yang Ye shook his head slightly and was about to leave. Meanwhile, Yang Lianshuang was about to say something, but Yang Ye suddenly stopped and said, “Do you still not understand? I’m not suitable to lead the human race. I’m plagued by too many personal enmities, and if I lead the human race, that enmity will fall on them too. For example, I want to destroy the Alliance of All and the two Paths, but do you think I can accomplish that if I’m burdened with the human race? It’s impossible!”

Yang Ye shook his head, “The one who leads the human race cannot have any personal enmities or act impetuously, but I, Yang Ye, can never let go of that enmity.”

Yang Ye walked off once he finished speaking.

Yang Lianshuang fell silent for a long time, and then she sighed softly.

Just as Yang Ye had said, he had too much enmity around him, and his own character really wasn’t suited for being a leader!

“Big Brother!” Suddenly, Tian Xiu appeared in front of Yang Ye.

Yang Ye gazed at her, “Yes?”

Tian Xiu looked up at Yang Ye, “Perhaps you should go there and have a look at the Human Dimension!”

Yang Ye shook his head, “I don’t want to!”

Tian Xiu took Yang Ye’s hand, “Just treat it as going there with me, alright?”

Yang Ye fell silent for a long time and asked, “Why?”

Tian Xiu spoke softly, “Just go with me, alright?”

Yang Ye rubbed her head gently, “Alright!”

While she was acting a little strangely, he’d decided to do as she wished.

Tian Xiu cracked a smile.

Just like that, Yang Ye and Tian Xiu left Void Spirit Continent for the Human Dimension.

As soon as he entered the Human Dimension, Yang Ye frowned.

Slaughter intent!

After he arrived here, Yang Ye sensed a dense strand of slaughter intent, and it filled the entire dimension.

It was undoubtedly a good thing for someone like him!

However, it may not be a good thing for the human race.

“Come with me!” She took Yang Ye’s hand and floated off into the distance, and Yang Lianshuang followed them.

It didn’t take long for her to bring him to an ancient city. It wasn’t that huge, and it could only accommodate around 100,000. But at this moment, it was empty.

There were only corpses and blood here!

Especially blood, they seemed to flow into rivers that seeped out incessantly from the city. Besides that a huge amount of slaughter intent still remained in the city. However, as soon as Yang Ye arrived here, the remaining slaughter intent converged toward him.

Suddenly, Yang Lianshuang looked to the right, “Show yourself!”

A moment of silence ensued, and then a young boy suddenly crawled out of a corner there. The young boy was in rags, and his hands tightly clenched together. Behind him was a young girl who was shorter than him, and her countenance was pale while she held tightly onto the young boy’s hand. A group of dead rats were near the pair, and some rat bones!

They were eating rats!

They were eating rats until now!

Yang Lianshuang turned away from the sight of this, and her eyes instantly became moist.

Yang Lianshuang was no emotional person, but anyone who witnessed this couldn’t stay indifferent.

There was no spirit energy left here. Besides some lowly creatures, anyone else with the ability would have left in search of spirit energy by now. As for those without that ability, they had no choice but to stay.

Without spirit energy and food, they could only use anything and everything to fill their bellies.

Meanwhile, Tian Xiu suddenly walked over to them. The young boy immediately stood before the young girl. However, his eyes were filled with fear, or it should be described as a pleading expression.

When she arrived before them, the young boy suddenly knelt down, “W-We don’t have stones, no stones.” He kowtowed as he spoke.

Stones!

He was naturally talking about immortal stones!

Tian Xiu gazed at the young girl behind the boy, and she timidly gazed at Tian Xiu. However, perhaps it was because of their similar ages, the young girl wasn’t that vigilant toward Tian Xiu.

Tian Xiu raised her hands slightly, and the young boy was immediately supported up by an invisible vase of force. After that, a roasted lamb leg appeared before them.

Their gazes were instantly glued to it, and it was like their gazes were frozen on it and couldn’t be moved away.

Tian Xiu suddenly said, “Eat!”

The young boy gulped and gazed at Tian Xiu, “C-Can we?”

Tian Xiu nodded.

Once he got her approval, the young boy picked up the lamb leg and was about to eat. However, he seemed to have thought of something, and he hurriedly turned around and passed it to the young girl, “Nan’nan, you eat.”

The young girl gulped and took a small bite. A moment later, her eyes lit up, and then she took a big bite. However, she didn’t forget the young boy. As soon as she took a bite, she passed it to the young boy. The leg was huge, so the young boy didn’t refuse it. However, he just took a small bite.

A short while later, the young girl suddenly started coughing.

She was choking!

The young boy started crying from anxiousness when he witnessed this, and then he knelt before Yang Ye before kowtowing. Obviously, he thought it was poisoned!

Yang Ye fell silent for a moment, and then he flicked a strand of violet energy into the young girl. A moment later, she returned to normal.

Yang Ye turned around and walked away.

He took a few steps before suddenly stopping, and he said, “Lianshuang, tell them that if anyone besides humans are in the Human Dimension in two hours from now, I’ll kill every single one of them!”

Suddenly, a sword howl resounded through the large universe!

At this moment, countless experts looked up, and they gazed toward the source of it.

Countless people watched as a ray of golden sword energy tore through the starry sky before descending into the Human Dimension.

Yang Ye turned around, and a ray of light flashed down from the sky before a woman in a violet dress appeared before him. She walked slowly in Yang Ye’s direction and dropped down to one knee, “I, the Sword Supreme, am willing to take you as my master.”
