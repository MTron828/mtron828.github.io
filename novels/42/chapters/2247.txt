Chapter 2248 – I’ve Been There!

At the door of light in the endless black holes, Tian Xiu’s ray of dark light had just arrived before the door when a hand stretched out and tapped against it.

Bang!

The dark light exploded apart, and the person within the door of light was blasted back inside.

The door of light returned to normal.

A long time passed before a voice came from within, “I wasn’t sure before this, but now I am. So you really are targeting my undying race.”

In the hall on Void Spirit Continent, Tian Xiu had indifference on her face as she waved her hand.

Hiss!

A ray of dark light pierced through layers of space and arrived before the door of light and slammed against it.

Boom!

The door of light shook violently and gradually turned ethereal.

Suddenly, a strand of black energy seeped out from the door, and enveloped it. An instant later, the door of light vanished completely.

“Just you wait!” The voice resounded and quickly vanished.

In the hall on Void Spirit Continent.

Tian Xiu withdrew her gaze and spoke indifferently, “They are coming soon!”

Yang Ye asked, “The undying race?”

She nodded, “The undying cavalry may be strong, but they aren’t a huge threat. The undying race’s true experts will be coming next. At that time, the large universe will truly be finished.” Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Yang Ye asked, “They were trying to come here just now?”

Tian Xiu nodded slightly.

Yang Ye glanced at her and spoke softly, “You can stop them from coming here!”

She gazed at him and smiled, “It’s just temporary. You still need time, so I’ll help you get that.”

Yang Ye fell silent.

Tian Xiu was much, much stronger than he’d imagined!

She truly possessed unfathomable strength!

Meanwhile, Tian Xiu continued, “Let’s talk about your Sword Domain. I’ve found you a new path, so just follow it in the future. The Domain is a new world, but your strength isn’t sufficient to create a new world in this universe. Of course, it doesn’t mean that you can't do so in the future. However, it’s absolutely impossible for you now. Under such circumstances, you can start from yourself!”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Myself?”

Tian Xiu nodded, “You can use yourself as the foundation to become a Domain yourself. Simply speaking, allow yourself to gain independence from this universe. Once your Domain has shrunk around you, you are independent from this universe. At the same time, the condensation of your energy gives you extremely formidable strength.”

Yang Ye asked, “Independence from this universe? What does that do?”

Tian Xiu smiled, “Think of it like this. The world is a circle, and when you shrink your Sword Domain around you, you’ve stepped out of that circle and are not restricted by its laws. For example, if this world collapses, you won’t die. Besides that, if you attack someone within that circle, it will have extraordinary effects. Because your Domain transcends the laws of this world. If you don’t believe me, you can give it a try!”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and said, “Tian Xiu, I have a question before I try it. Why must I shrink it to myself to obtain such an effect?”

She replied softly, “It’s linked to your strength. The goal is to separate yourself from this universe, and you can barely accomplish that. However, separating a portion of this universe’s space as well is beyond your current ability. If you can casually separate the space of this universe into your Sword Domain one day, then there’ll be practically no one within this universe who’s a match for you. After all, how can anyone win in a battle against someone who’s in their own territory?”

Yang Ye spoke softly, “Then I’ll be invincible?”

“Invincible?” She chuckled and shook her head, “You wish.”

Yang Ye gazed at her, “Huh?”

She spoke softly, “It doesn’t exist. No one can be truly invincible. As far as I’m concerned, it’s a mental state, an aura. Try using your Domain now. Let me teach you while we still have time.”

Yang Ye nodded and started shrinking it again.

This time, it was easier than the last. However, it still wasn’t easy. It didn’t take long for his face to turn ghastly pale.

A short while later, it had shrunk down to his body. At this moment, the space Yang Ye was in and the space both Tian Xiu and An Nanjing were in, was different. However, Yang Ye felt terrible.

How did it feel?

He felt like something was pressing down on him and wanted to smash him apart!

Strength!

It was the strength of the Sword Domain after it was condensed to this state. All of it had been shrunk to the small area around him, so it was obvious how terrifying it was!

Meanwhile, Tian Xiu gazed at An Nanjing, “Attack him! Use everything you’ve got!”

An Nanjing pondered deeply for a moment, and then she stabbed Burning Fury at Yang Ye.

Hiss!

Sparks flashed on the tip of the spear, and then they erupted like a volcano. An extremely terrifying wave of energy enveloped Yang Ye.

Meanwhile, Tian Xiu’s voice resounded in Yang Ye’s mind, “Use your sword!”

Yang Ye opened his eyes and a sword appeared in his grasp, and then he swung it forward.

A strange scene appeared.

Hiss!

As soon as Yang Ye’s sword descended, a ray of sword energy passed through the energy from An Nanjing’s spear and instantly arrived before her. Her expression changed drastically, and she didn’t have time to counterattack because she hadn’t expected this. She immediately issued a command in her heart, and the shield the god race gave her appeared in front of her.

However, the sword energy passed through the shield and slammed against her.

Bang!

An Nanjing was blasted out of the hall, and her figure was still being pushed back while blood surged out incessantly from her mouth. Suddenly, Tian Xiu appeared behind An Nanjing, and then she tapped An Nanjing’s back lightly. In an instant, An Nanjing’s figure stopped while the energy from Yang Ye’s sword energy vanished.

Once she stood still, An Nanjing wiped off the blood from the corner of her mouth, and then looked up at Yang Ye. However, Yang Ye was on the ground.

An Nanjing gazed at Tian Xiu, “He…”

Tian Xiu replied softly, “He still can’t endure and control the strength of it. He’s suffering from backlash.”

An Nanjing fell silent for a short moment and said, “Why did that attack…?”

Tian Xiu smiled, “Are you very shocked?”

An Nanjing nodded.

Tian Xiu spoke softly, “That’s why Domains are so terrifying. It ignores the rules of this world, completely ignores it. So, its energy struck completely on you.”

An Nanjing asked, “Is it impossible to defend again?”

“Of course not!” Tian Xiu gazed at her right hand and clenched it slowly, “His strength ignores all laws of this world, but at my level, my strength can do that too. However, we don’t ignore it, we forcefully destroy all laws. It’s an essential difference. But your current strength is incapable of doing that, so I helped you deal with it!”

An Nanjing fell silent.

Meanwhile, Tian Xiu continued, “When he can separate a world of another’s into his own Domain, he will be a peerless expert. Now, he’s just a little strong.”

As soon as she finished speaking, she tapped forward, and a black scroll appeared before An Nanjing.

An Nanjing was puzzled, “What’s this?”

Tian Xiu replied, “My void spirit race’s inheritance, all of it. There is knowledge in the Martial Dao and various other Daos in there, and there even is knowledge about the control and mastery of various energies. Everything you can dream of is in there. Besides that, I’ve included my own annotations, and I’ve done so for the good and the bad. If you can absorb it all, then based on your natural talent, you’ll become one of the strongest experts in this world within ten years.”

She closed her eyes slowly at this point, “I only have one request, when you do pass it on to someone else, just tell that person it’s the inheritance of the void spirit race.”

An Nanjing gazed at Tian Xiu, “You…”

Tian Xiu shook her head slightly, “I want some time alone. Take care of him and train with him once he wakes up. You don’t have much time either, so don’t waste it. Especially him, ask him to get used to shrinking his Sword Domain. Only then will he have the ability to fight back when he encounters an expert like me. As for you, you must learn everything without that scroll as soon as possible. Remember that while you can learn everything in that scroll, you must only use them and not chance your own core Martial Dao. Otherwise, you’ll take a mistaken path of treading on another’s path.”

She walked slowly out of the hall once she finished speaking.

An Nanjing held the scroll in silence.

Her heart felt quite heavy!

Tian Xiu left the hall and walked toward the city. When she passed a corner, an old man stood not too far away from her and bowed slightly to her.

The old man was Elder Yuan, and there was a woman by his side, Yang Lianshuang.

Elder Yuan bowed respectfully to Tian Xiu, “Senior, please provide me with your guidance!”

He knew that it was his only chance, and he naturally didn’t want to let it slip by. So, he’d come.

Tian Xiu glanced at him and pondered deeply for a moment, “There are nine levels in the heavens, nine branches in the ground too, and 108 constellations that form the Heaven Dao. One of them escaped to become a variable, and that’s why the Heaven Dao always has a variable. Your Grand Dao is the Prediction Dao, so you must be cautious. Do not try to predict everything because the Heaven Dao always has a variable.”

“I see!” Elder Yuan mumbled softly, and then he took a deep breath and bowed respectfully to her, “I will never forget this kindness.”

Tian Xiu spoke indifferently, “He’s fierce and acts willfully, so it’s easy for others to scheme against him. Do you understand what I mean?”

Elder Yuan replied, “I do!”

Tian Xiu nodded slightly and started walking off. However, she suddenly stopped after taking two steps, and she gazed at Yang Lianshuang, “I’ve been to your hometown!”

Yang Lianshuang’s figure stiffened on the spot, and she gazed at Tian Xiu with astonishment while being at a loss for words.
