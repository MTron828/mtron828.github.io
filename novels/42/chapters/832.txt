Chapter 833 – He’s Too Arrogant!

Translator: InVader

Editor: Conspiracing

Yang Ye would be an idiot to not realize it was these 2 pythons who were overcoming that tribulation from before, and it made him feel like killing himself. My god! I actually save them!

What was it like to court death? This was exactly it!

Yang Ye truly wanted to cry....

His current strength was naturally insufficient to resist 2 Half-Saints. Not to mention two, he couldn’t even resist one. However, he hadn’t resigned himself to submitting to them and waiting for death. So, the profound energy within him started to surge madly, and he would immediately utilize Heavenrend and his Decay Sword Intent if they dared to attack him.

While it would very likely reduce him to the same crippled state that he was in just a while ago, how could he be bothered by that when death was the other option?

“Talk about it? How truly laughable!” The python on the left spoke ferociously, “If you didn’t destroy our Energy Concealment Formation, then how could the Heaven Dao have noticed us? It was all your fault! It was you who caused our years of planning to be undone. You deserve death!”

It was about to attack once it finished speaking. Yang Ye’s eyelids twitched, and he tightened his grip of his sword in response. He was prepared to draw it at any moment.

However, the python on the right suddenly said, “Big Sister, forget it. Our actions were never right. Now that we’ve failed, we can only blame it on fate. Moreover, I don’t think he did it on purpose. Besides that, we would have died by now if he didn’t give us that strand of Quintessence Violet Energy!”

Yang Ye had a really good impression of the python on the right when he heard that, and he said, “Senior, you’re absolutely right. It has already come to this, so fighting will definitely be unable to solve the problem. Why don’t we just sit down and talk about it...?”

The python on the left spoke furiously, “Talk? What is there to talk about? I’m truly unable to vent my hatred if I don’t kill you!”

As soon as it finished speaking, it opened its mouth and intended to swallow Yang Ye alive.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly shouted, “Do you know who I am?”

Yang Ye hurriedly continued before the python could speak, “I’m a disciple of Daoist Gu from the Ancient Sword School. If you dare to oppress me, then my master will definitely destroy Broken Sky Mountain Range!” At this moment, Yang Ye could only hope that Daoist Gu’s name could deter the python. Otherwise, he might really die here.

“Daoist Gu?” The python closed its mouth and didn’t attack.

Yang Ye immediately heaved a sigh of relief when he witnessed this scene, and he said, “Not only am I his disciple, I’m the next Sword Master that the Ancient Sword School is fostering in secret. If you attack me, then the entire Ancient Sword School would definitely swarm out and crush the entire demon race here!”

Meanwhile, the python had suddenly transformed into a red clothed woman. She was extremely beautiful with exquisite features and a curvaceous figure, and she had dark red pupils that made her reveal a strange sort of beauty.

“Are you threatening us?” She walked slowly towards Yang Ye while ghastly killing intent filled her eyes.

Yang Ye pointed his sword up into the air and spoke coldly, “I just have to release a sword howl, and then the Sword Master of my Ancient Sword School and my Master will be here in an instant!”

“Trust me, I can kill you before they even arrive!” said the red clothed woman.

Yang Ye took a deep breath, put his sword away, and said, “I caused both of you to fail on the verge of success, and that was my mistake. But even your sister knows that besides forming enmity with my Ancient Sword School, you’ll get nothing from killing me. So, I think that we can talk about it. After all, peace and harmony are always the best....”

“What if I refuse?”

“Why don’t you give it a try?”

Yang Ye’s gaze turned icy cold. At the same time, he sheathed his sword again!

He didn’t seek trouble, but he wasn’t afraid of it!

She gazed at Yang Ye for a short while, and then she suddenly stretched her hand forward and made a grasping motion. The space around him instantly started to shrink, and the powerful pressure it exerted upon him almost crushed his bones into pieces. Fury flashed through Yang Ye’s eyes as he grabbed the hilt of his sword, and he was just about to draw it.

However, a woman in a green dress suddenly appeared between Yang Ye and the woman in red clothes, and the pressure instantly vanished.

“Qing Ling, what’re you doing!?” The red clothed woman was slightly displeased.

The woman in a green dress who was called Qing Ling shook her head, “Big Sister, he’s right. Besides being able to vent the anger in our hearts, there’s no benefit to killing him. Conversely, we would form enmity with the Ancient Sword School.”

The red clothed woman spoke coldly, “He’s too arrogant, and I can’t stand the sight of him!”

Yang Ye was speechless.

Qing Ling shook her head slightly before she turned around to look at Yang Ye. At this moment, Yang Ye finally saw her appearance, and he was surprised to notice that she looked exactly alike to the red clothed woman. They simply seemed like they were made from the same mold, and he wouldn’t have been able to differentiate them if they weren’t wearing different clothes!

The woman in a green dress was about to speak when the red clothed woman’s expression suddenly changed, and she looked up into the sky. After that, both of them transformed into tiny snakes that shot into Yang Ye’s sleeves and coiled around his arms.

Yang Ye was stunned.

“We’ll kill you if you say a word!” An icy cold voice resounded in Yang Ye’s mind. It was the older sister of the pair.

“An enemy of ours is here. You absolutely can’t tell him that we’re with you!” It was the younger sister this time.

Suddenly, a robust middle aged man arrived here.

Yang Ye’s pupils constricted slightly because the man’s strength wasn’t inferior at all to Xu Qianye and the Hallowed Lord while they were still Half-Saints!

He was a high rank Half-Saint!

The middle aged man paid no attention to Yang Ye. He just glanced incessantly at the surroundings instead. A short while passed before he suddenly laughed coldly, “Bitches! You actually thought you could attain the Saint Realm? How laughable!”

After that, he swiftly turned around to gaze at Yang Ye and said, “Human?”

Yang Ye nodded, and then he cupped his fist at the middle aged man, “Greetings Senior, I’m Daoist Gu’s Personal Disciple from the Ancient Sword School’s Heavenly Sword Peak!” Since he’d used this lie so many times, he felt that it made no difference to do it again!

“Daoist Gu?” The middle aged man frowned slightly, and he sized up Yang Ye for a moment before he said, “Did you see 2 multicolored pythons?”

Yang Ye was about to speak when he felt his left arm being squeezed, and it caused his expression to darken slightly. A short while passed before he shook his head, “I haven’t.” He knew that if he said that he had, then while those 2 women would die, he would definitely be the first to die!

“Since you haven’t, then you can just die!” The man waved his right hand as he spoke, and a gust of wind tore through space before instantly smashing against Yang Ye. A mouthful of blood sprayed out of Yang Ye’s mouth while his figure was thrown over 3km away. In the end, his figure smashed against a mountain, causing it to collapse and bury him beneath the rubble.

The middle aged man vanished once he waved his hand. In his opinion, killing an ant at the Exalt Realm only needed a mere wave of his palm!

However, he’d never imagined that it didn’t take long after he left for a person to crawl out of the rubble. It was naturally Yang Ye. Yang Ye hadn’t suffered any serious injuries because it was just a casual attack that didn’t carry the middle aged man’s full strength.

“What a fool!” Suddenly, the red clothed woman and the woman in a green dress appeared in front of Yang Ye. The red clothed woman spoke coldly, “The Ancient Sword School is strong, but not every member of the demon race fears it. At the very least, that Demon Commander from before has no need to fear the Ancient Sword School. Because the Demon King he serves is enemies with the Ancient Sword School. So, weren’t you just courting death by speaking about the Ancient Sword School?”

Yang Ye paid no attention to her, and he just looked up into the sky instead. At this moment, he felt his weakness even more strongly. Because even if he recovered his strength, the ninth rank of the Monarch Realm, it would still be too weak in the Radiant Dimension.

Looks like I must scour the world for extreme-grade energy stones! Yang Ye took a deep breath before he stood up, turned around, and left.

“What a strong body!” Qing Ling’s eyes had a wisp of surprise flash through them when she saw Yang Ye seem as if he was completely fine, and it was the same for the red clothed woman. After all, while it had only been a casual attack, it was still from a high rank Half-Saint, and not to mention an Exalt Realm cultivator, even a Monarch Realm cultivator wouldn’t have been able to resist such an attack!

Yang Ye hadn’t even taken a few steps before he stopped once more because the red clothed woman was standing in his way.

The red clothed woman spoke coldly, “We were high rank Half-Saints, and we even had a chance to step into the Saint Realm earlier. However, you destroyed our formation and allowed the Heavenly Tribulation to appear in advance. Now, not only have our strengths fallen to the ranks of ordinary Half-Saints, even our bodies are severely damaged. Our current combat strength is even inferior to ordinary Half-Saints. Tell me, how should we deal with this?”

“What do you want!?” Yang Ye continued, “In any case, I won’t pay with my life!”

She grunted coldly in reply, and then she gazed at Qing Ling. The latter walked over to Yang Ye and said, “We definitely can’t stay here because our Demon King is still in closed door cultivation. If the Demon Kings of other mountain ranges or humans find out that we’re heavily injured, then we’ll definitely be killed in order to obtain our inner cores. So, we intend to go with you!”

“With me?” Yang Ye frowned and said, “Both of you aren’t joking, right?”

Qing Ling said, “We were injured by a Heavenly Tribulation, so we aren’t able to recover with ordinary spirit energy. Moreover, our next tribulation is coming. So, we’ll definitely die if we don’t recover as soon as possible.

“My profound energy can help you recover, so you intend to stay with me and use it to recover, right?” asked Yang Ye.

She nodded in response.

Yang Ye started smiling, and then he said, “Would I benefit from that?” Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

The red clothed woman spoke coldly, “The benefit is that you won’t have to die!”

“Woman! Don’t act so arrogantly!”

“You’re courting death!” She was furious and about to attack, but Qing Ling stopped her before speaking to Yang Ye, “We had a huge amount of treasures, but all of them were destroyed while we attempted to resist the Heavenly Tribulation earlier. As for the other precious treasures we possessed, all of them were destroyed by the Heavenly Tribulation as well. So....”

Yang Ye pondered deeply for a short while and said, “Both of you can stay with me, but you have to help me when I face danger!” He was currently all alone in this world, and it would be a great thing if he had the help of 2 experts!

She replied, “That’s not a problem. However, we won’t be able to help you for some time!”

Yang Ye asked, “Why?”

She answered, “Our injuries are very severe, and we have to rest for some time. We can’t help you during that period. Moreover, you even have to transfer that violet profound energy of yours to us, from time to time!”

Yang Ye thought deeply for a moment before he replied, “Alright!”

Just like that, a small snake resided beneath each of Yang Ye’s sleeves.

A slight smile arose on the corners of Yang Ye’s mouth. While they couldn’t help him for some time, and they even came with a certain amount of danger tied to them, they would be of great assistance to him if he used them well. After all, they needed his help. However, Yang Ye was very well aware that he had to improve his strength as soon as possible. Otherwise, he wouldn’t be qualified to bargain with them again once they’d recovered their true strengths!

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts and swiftly left the gorge. However, at the exact same instant that he had, a red glow that was like a thread of blood suddenly appeared by his neck and was about to chop off his head!

At the same time, a voice resounded by his ear, “No one has dared to take things from my Dao Order. Even if there has been someone who did that, that person is dead now! Now, you’ll become such a person as well!”
