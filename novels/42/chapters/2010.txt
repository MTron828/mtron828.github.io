Chapter 2011 – A Familiar Voice!

Everyone in the surroundings was quite stunned. They hadn’t expected the young man to attack first.

Meanwhile, Gu Cangyan ridiculed, “This is the noble sky race!”

He didn’t keep his voice down at all, so many people heard him.

The young man was extremely swift, and he instantly arrived before Yang Ye. In next to no time, a blood red scythe hooked down at Yang Ye’s head. He clearly wanted to slice off Yang Ye’s head!

Suddenly, Yang Ye’s sword vanished.

A sword howl resounded through the entire city.

Hiss!

An ear piercing sword howl resounded, and then the young man and his scythe were blasted away. They flew for over 1km before the young man stopped himself.

The young man glanced at his scythe. At this moment, there was an extremely deep gap in its blade!

The young man’s face became solemn at the sight of this, and he looked up at Yang Ye, “Interesting!”

“Interesting?” Yang Ye chuckled, “I think so too!”

Yang Ye vanished on the spot, and he was in front of the young man when he appeared again. Yang Ye had left a string of afterimages behind him!

The young man’s pupils constricted, and then he swiftly slammed his scythe down at Yang Ye.

Clang!

In an instant, the scythe slammed against the sword, and then an ear piercing explosion resounded. The young man was blasted away again. However, his scythe vanished at the instant he flew away.

Yang Ye stopped and stabbed his sword forward, and it stabbed against the tip of the blood red scythe.

Bang!

The scythe was blasted away.

Meanwhile, the young man soared up into the air. He held the blood red scythe tightly while his profound energy surged madly into it, causing the scythe to emanate a faint blood red glow!

The young man looked down at Yang Ye, and he swung the scythe down with both hands, “Soul Devourer!”

As soon as he roared with fury, a ray of blood red light flashed out from the scythe and surged down towards Yang Ye. The fortified space in the sky was instantly obliterated before it.

A long spatial rift appeared behind the blood red light.

Yang Ye took a step forward. He didn’t use a technique, and he just raised his sword and stabbed upwards. Even an ordinary swing of his sword contained countless sword techniques, so while it seemed very ordinary, it wasn’t ordinary at all!

It stabbed the blood red light, and Yang Ye was pushed around 30m back. As for the red light, it didn’t vanish, and it pressed down upon Yang Ye’s sword.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye twisted his sword, “Break!”

The blood red light instantly exploded apart and was obliterated. Meanwhile, the young man had appeared in front of Yang Ye, and then a scythe arrived right above Yang Ye’s head.

Yang Ye didn’t try to defend himself against it, and he just swung his sword at the young man’s chest.

Striking after the enemy attacked!

While he’d attacked after the young man, it was much faster than the blood red scythe!

The young man’s expression changed drastically at the sight of this. He was very well aware that if he didn’t stop his attack and defend himself, Yang Ye’s sword would pierce a hole through his chest. Moreover, once a sword in the hands of such a sword cultivator pierced his body, it would be able to instantly shatter his internal organs!

The young man didn’t dare to sacrifice his own life to take Yang Ye’s. The scythe suddenly turned back and obstructed Yang Ye’s attack.

Clang!

A clear and resounding clang resounded, and the young man was blasted away with his scythe.

At the exact same moment, Yang Ye unfurled his grip, and a sword started spinning on his palm. An instant later, the sword vanished.

The young man’s expression changed drastically. He wanted to dodge it, but it was too late, and a sword had pressed against his forehead.

He’d lost!

The young man in blue robes had lost!

The surroundings fell silent.

The white robed old man’s face was extremely gloomy. No one knew what he was thinking. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

As for the woman, she’d fallen silent as well, and her face was slightly gloomy.

A genius of the sky race had lost to a human in the Sky Dimension!

It was absolutely difficult for people of the sky race to accept this.

Yang Ye waved his right hand, and his sword immediately flew back into his grasp. Yang Ye glanced at the old man and said, “This is the strength of the noble sky race’s geniuses? They can’t even defeat a human like me?”

The old man stared at Yang Ye in silence.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye chuckled, “Don’t look at me! Get the next one!”

The woman suddenly appeared in front of Yang Ye, “What exactly do you want?”

Yang Ye spoke indifferently, “It’s nothing. I just want to fight the geniuses of the sky race.”

She spoke in a low voice, “This method will never make my father give your friend to you!”

Yang Ye looked her in the eyes, “Would he give her to me if I spoke nicely to him? He wouldn’t. Because as far as all of you are concerned, people like us are just ants, right?”

She fell silent.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye glanced at the others from the sky race. At this moment, clamorous noise filled the surroundings. More than half of the people in Sky City were here, and even more were constantly rushing over.

It was an ocean of people!

Yang Ye glanced at the crowd in the surroundings and asked, “Does no one dare to fight me?”

He was absolutely overbearing!

At this moment, Yang Ye was absolutely overbearing, and it made extremely unsightly expressions cover the faces of everyone from the sky race. Many had started shouting, and it was obviously shouts that wished for Yang Ye’s death. However, there was still no one who dared to challenge Yang Ye.

The sky race had no lock of hotblooded people, but they were very well aware that challenging Yang Ye was pointless, and it would only bring shame to them. They weren’t on the same level as Yang Ye!

Moreover, Yang Ye clearly had no intention of stopping.

What should we do?

All the members of the sky race were thinking the same thing. The sky race will be utterly humiliated if he’s allowed to continue!

Suddenly, the white robed old man raised his palms and pressed them down lightly, and the clamorous noise in the surroundings instantly vanished. The old man gazed at Yang Ye, “Needless to say, you’ve really made us look at you in a new light. However, if you think that you can bully the younger generation of my sky race, then you’re absolutely mistaken. My sky race’s genius will be here to fight you in two hours!”

He vanished on the spot once he finished speaking.

Yang Ye chuckled, “I’ll be waiting!”

Meanwhile, Gu Cangyan walked over to Yang Ye’s side, “Brother Yang, you have enmity with the sky race?”

Yang Ye nodded, “A little!” He glanced at Gu Cangyan and continued, “I presume there’s a reason why you came here to challenge the geniuses on the Talent Rankings, right?”

Gu Cangyan nodded slightly, “The sky race is terribly arrogant and overbearing. Not too long ago, that fellow ranked at the 2nd position on their Talent Rankings went to my Devil Dimension, and he challenged the rankings in our city. I wasn’t there, so after he won, he insulted my devil race. He said the younger generation of my devil race is useless. I only found out about that after I left the Dead Dimension, so I came here!”

I see! Yang Ye nodded slightly.

Meanwhile, Gu Cangyan added, “What about you?”

Yang Ye smiled, “It’s nothing. I just can’t stand the sight of them!”

Gu Cangyan was stunned speechless.

Somewhere in Sky City.

A white robed old man appeared within an estate. As soon as he appeared there, a middle aged man suddenly appeared in front of him.

The middle aged man asked, “Elder Zhu, you’re here because of that?”

The white robed old man said, “You already know?”

The middle aged nodded slightly, “How could I not be aware of something major like that? He’s not ordinary.”

The old man spoke solemnly, “Indeed. He escalated it to such an extent that we can’t act against him, and we can’t drive him away either. Otherwise, the world will think that our sky race fears him. So, I came to you because I hope that kid will help deal with him!”

The middle aged man fell silent.

The old man asked, “Is there a problem?”

The middle aged man shook his head slightly, “He naturally has to help since our sky race’s honor is at stake. Elder Zhu, please go on ahead. I’ll tell him to head over to Talent Arena.”

The old man nodded and vanished on the spot.

Sky City. Talent Arena.

The arena had been shattered during the previous battles, but a completely new arena was in its place now, and it was much larger and stronger than the last arena.

The white robed old man suddenly appeared in the arena. Yang Ye opened his eyes and gazed at the old man, and the latter spoke indifferently, “Don’t blame my sky race for being merciless. We’ll give you a chance now. Kowtow 100 times, and my sky race will spare you. Alright?”

“Kowtow 100 times?” Yang Ye was stunned and asked, “Is there something wrong with you?”

The old man’s eyes narrowed slightly, and he laughed coldly, “Do you know who’s coming to fight you?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “I don’t!”

The old man laughed coldly, “He’s from the Dead Dimension. Do you know what kind of place that is?”

“The Dead Dimension?” Yang Ye was stunned.

Meanwhile, Gu Cangyan suddenly said, “Don’t you know that he has been…”

Gu Cangyan stopped abruptly at this point. He looked up at the sky, and a voice came from there, “Who wants to challenge the geniuses of my sky race! Come! I’ll play with you! Don’t worry! I promise not to kill you!”

Yang Ye was stunned when he heard this.

That’s such a familiar voice!
