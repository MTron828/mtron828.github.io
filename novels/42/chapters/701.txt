Chapter 702 – Even I’m Afraid Of Myself When I’m Angry!

The sword qi wasn’t enhanced by Sword Intent, and it was just a pure strand of sword qi.

However, it was exactly such a pure strand of sword qi which made Yang Ye act like he was ‘facing a formidable opponent’. His entire body was tense like a fully drawn bow.

Many people in the surroundings couldn’t help but start laughing when they saw him act like that. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Qian Mei laughed with ridicule before looking at Xiao Man with a gaze that was filled with disdain and ridicule. The latter held tightly onto her iron hammers and seemed to be ready to lend a hand at any moment.

Finally, the sword qi arrived before Yang Ye.

Yang Ye suddenly moved. He clenched his right hand into a fist and pulled it back slightly. In the next moment, he attacked swiftly, and he smashed a punch towards the sword qi, causing a wave of energy to flash forward.

Bang!

The wave of energy and sword qi exploded apart upon impact, and this stunned all the spectators. He actually blasted Bai Chen’s sword qi into pieces?

In the next moment, they were stunned again because Yang Ye’s figure suddenly moved backwards repeatedly, and he only stopped after moving almost 100 steps back.

After he stopped moving, Yang Ye started to gasp for breath as if that punch had used all the strength within him!

“Haha! Such trash actually bragged about resisting 3 attacks from Bai Chen? I finally understand what overestimating one’s strength is! This is the epitome of it!”

“I’d thought that he was putting on a show of weakness to give us a surprise. But now it would seem like he really is just a weakling. He was even almost unable to resist just 10% of Bai Chen’s strength. He can be considered to be one of the weakest even amongst the Exalt Realm!”

“I’ve lived for over 20 years, but I’ve never seen someone so determined to seek death....”

Fu Jinxian shook her head as she gazed at Yang Ye, and then she withdrew her gaze. Just like everyone else, she’d thought that Yang Ye would surprise her, but the facts of the situation were that he’d almost been unable to resist just 10% of Bai Chen’s strength. If there were expectations, then there would be disappointment. She was disappointed right now. There was no reason why, and it was just pure disappointment.

It was like being prepared to watch an entertaining show, but the actor suddenly failed to portray the part. It was definitely something that would arouse disappointment in others!

As she gazed at Yang Ye who was still gasping, Xiaoman wanted to go over but was stopped by Tong Fen who said, “Let him suffer a little. It’ll be beneficial to him!”

Xiaoman was just about to speak when Yang Ye suddenly started walking towards Bai Chen, and he walked extremely slowly like a child who had just learned how to walk.

In the eyes of the spectators, it was undoubtedly a sign of suffering severe internal injuries!

“Con... cont... continue.” Yang Ye stuttered slightly.

Bai Chen pointed his sword towards the ground and shot a sideways glance at Yang Ye, “You were actually able to resist 10% of my strength. Looks like you’re not completely trash. It seems like another strand of sword qi from me would cause your internal organs to be instantly shattered. The heavens are benevolent, and so am I. Don’t say that I didn’t give you a chance. Kneel right now, kowtow, and admit your mistakes to Mei’er. I’ll let you live if she’s willing to forgive you!”

Qian Mei grunted coldly and crossed her arms before her as she gazed at Yang Ye, “I’ll forgive you if you kowtow 100 times to me. Alright?” She gazed at Xiaoman as she spoke.

Xiaoman didn’t speak. She just walked over to Yang Ye’s side and took his hand, “Let’s leave!”

“The battle isn’t over!” Meanwhile, Qian Yan spoke coldly, “Of course, you can leave. But you must admit defeat!”

Xiaoman was just about to speak when Yang Ye suddenly flipped his palm and grabbed her hand instead, and then shock appeared in Xiaoman’s eyes.

Yang Ye smiled and said, “Don’t worry, it’ll be fine!” As he spoke, he let go of her and continued walking towards Bai Chen.

Xiaoman remained on the spot as if she was petrified.

“Cont... continue!” Yang Ye seemed as if he’d decided to risk his life when he spoke these words, and resolve covered his face.

The Grand Elder who was supporting Yang Ye sat on the chair with his eyes slightly closed. It seemed as if he was in deep sleep. No one knew what he was thinking. On the other hand, Qian Yan who sat by his side was smiling from ear to ear. After all, the scene which played out before his eyes just now had caused that last trace of worry in his heart to vanish.

Actually, while Yang Ye’s display was slightly exaggerated, it wasn’t too far off from the truth. Because of the special characteristics possessed by 10th level Sword Intent and above, he could absorb the Sword Intent of anyone who possessed Sword Intent at a level beneath his own. He could have just stood there without moving just now and allowed it to strike him. Because it still wouldn’t be able to harm him in the slightest!

Not to mention 10% of Bai Chen’s strength, even if Bai Chen utilized 100% of his strength, it was still impossible for him to harm Yang Ye with his sword qi. However, Yang Ye didn’t do that. As for the reason? There were 2. Firstly, he didn’t want to expose his strength yet. Secondly, he had a plan of his own....

That was exactly why he’d utilized his physical strength to deal with that sword qi. At this moment, the internal injuries he suffered were extremely severe, so forcefully utilizing his strength naturally caused him to feel unwell. Coupled with his intent to conceal his strength, it was naturally ease for him to deceive the Half-Saints who were present here.

The others in the surroundings were dumbstruck when they heard Yang Ye.

“Did that collision knock out a screw in his head? They’ve already agreed to let him live if he admits defeat, yet he actually wants to insist on giving his life away. Is there really something wrong with him in the head?”

“It seems to me like he has gone mad with greed for those Firecrystals!”

“I still feel slight admiration for him. At the very least, I would absolutely not dare to do that!”

“As they say, a newborn calf isn’t aware of the terrors of a tiger or the ignorant are fearless. I bet the next attack will transform him into a corpse!”

Bai Chen tightened his grasp on his sword. For some unknown reason, a faint cold glow had suddenly appeared on his sword, and some of the profounders who were closer to him sensed a ghastly coldness coming from it.

Bai Chen gazed at Yang Ye and spoke coldly, “Did you think that you would be able to resist my 2nd attack since you succeed at resisting the 1st? If that’s what you’re thinking, then allow me to tell you that you’re mistaken, extremely mistaken.”

Yang Ye suddenly said, “Someone close to me told me that I have to keep a low profile and be cautious once I’ve left home, and I shouldn’t rashly cause trouble. Because she knows that my temper isn’t very good. Once I stop keeping a low profile, then it’s very likely the blood would flow into rivers. I’ve reflected on it and felt that I really was a madman when I got angry, and I should keep a low profile.”

When he spoke up to this point, Yang Ye paused for a moment before he said, “But when I encountered a conceited idiot like you, I was truly unable to restrain myself any longer. Motherfucker! If you want to fight then fight, why nag on continuously!? Don’t you just want to show off in front of everyone? Is that even necessary? Would you die if you don’t try to show off? Do you know how many times I’ve almost been unable to stop myself from killing you?”

The surroundings fell into deathly silence!

All of them opened their eyes wide and gazed at him with disbelief. He’s keeping a low profile? He has a bad temper? Blood will flow into rivers if he gets angry? He thinks he can kill Bai Chen? Has he gone mad?

Meanwhile, the Grand Elder opened his eyes and glanced at Yang Ye, but he immediately closed his eyes right after that.

As for Qian Yan, a cold smile and disdain still covered his face.

The 4th Elder and Tong Fen frowned slightly, and no one knew what they were thinking.

“You think you’re a defiant profounder?” Meanwhile, Qian Mei suddenly pointed at Yang Ye and spoke with disdain, “You’re keeping a low profile and have a bad temper? You’ll cause blood to flow into rivers? You want to kill Bao Chen? Why don’t you do it right now? Why don’t you let me see how you do that? An ant at the Exalt Realm like you is actually bragging like this. It’s the best joke I’ve ever heard!”

“You’ll have the chance!” Yang Ye glanced indifferently at her, and then he gazed at Bai Chen and said, “Come on? I’ve been standing here for a long time. Right, don’t waste your breath and try to threaten me, and don’t start bragging about yourself. I’m really not interested in listening to all of that. If you’re a man, then be a little more decisive so that we can conclude the matter and I can go have my food!”

The spectators were speechless when they heard this.

Bai Chen’s face wasn’t as carefree as it was before, and it was slightly ferocious instead, “Since you’re so desperate to die, then I’ll send you on your way!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Bai Chen stabbed his sword forward, and then a ray of sword qi shot out from its tip. It was extremely swift and arrived before Yang Ye in less than a breath of time. This strand of sword qi was still not enhanced by Sword Intent, but it was much stronger than the previous sword qi, and it was much faster as well!

Yang Ye remained still, and he only moved when it was just a few dozen centimeters away from him. He didn’t launch a counterattack but moved slightly to the side, and then the sword qi just flashed by right before him while leaving him completely unharmed....

The spectators were flabbergasted. He avoided it? He actually avoided it? Is this a joke?

Qian Mei, Fu Jinxian, and Bai Chen were all stunned. In next to no time, Bai Chen recovered from his shock and spoke furiously, “You’ve broken the rules. You said you would resist 3 attacks of mine, but you actually avoided it!”

Yang Ye laughed coldly and said, “I broke the rules? I said that I would resist them, but I never said that I wouldn’t dodge them. If you want to blame something, then blame your own sword qi for being too slow. Why am I the one to be blamed?”

“You....” Bai Chen’s face was livid.

“It wasn’t stated that he couldn’t dodge!” Meanwhile, the Grand Elder suddenly opened his eyes and said, “Being able to dodge can be considered as a form of ability as well. What do you think, 2nd Elder?”

Qian Yan’s expression was gloomy. He glanced at Yang Ye, and then he gazed at Bai Chen and said, “Can he not dodge? Stop holding back. Let me see if he’ll still be able to dodge then! Remember, don’t hold back!”

“He can only use 30% of his strength!” The Grand Elder spoke abruptly.

“30% is enough to kill him!” Meanwhile, Bai Chen roared furiously, and then his sword started trembling violently. After that, 10th level Sword Intent surged out from within him, and it caused countless spectators to be unable to help but take numerous steps back.
