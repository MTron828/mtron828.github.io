Chapter 2437 – Fuck Off!

It had been subdued just like that?

Yang Ye and the others were quite stunned.

Just a moment ago, it had seemed absolutely unconquerable, yet now, it was just floating there obediently while Snowy did as she pleased!

Obviously, Snowy had succeeded at subduing it.

Meanwhile, Snowy brought the wings over to Yang Ye, and as soon as it arrived before them, an extremely powerful aura of Yin Energy and Death Energy assaulted Yang Ye and the others.

It was extremely uncomfortable!

Snowy cracked a smile at Yang Ye from atop the Demon Wings of Death, and then she pointed at it.

She was telling him that it was with her now!

Yang Ye glanced at Snowy and said, “You’re amazing!”

Snowy’s smile grew even wider when Yang Ye praised her.

Suddenly, the Demon Wings of Death shook violently, and then the Death Energy and Yin Energy throughout the boundless cemetery converged toward them.

Yang Ye and the others became vigilant!

A Super Divine Treasure!

If it converted into their own realms of cultivation, a Super Divine Treasure was definitely above the five realms of the Limitbreaker Realm. Executor was a true Super Divine Treasure, but only 20% of its strength had been unsealed. Its true strength hadn’t been fully released. As for the Demon Wings of Death before him, it was a Super Divine Treasure, but in the past. Now, it could only be described as being boundlessly close to being a Super Divine Treasure. Or to be more precise, it was below Super Divine Treasures but superior to other ordinary Divine Treasures!

Even then, Yang Ye and the others didn’t dare to act carelessly before it!

Because the wings were infinitely close to a Five World Realm expert, so it wasn’t an existence that Four World Realm experts could resist.

The Death Energy and Yin Energy didn’t attack Yang Ye’s group and just converged into the wings.

Huang Ying shook his head, “The Hell Sect has suffered a terrible loss today!”

A’Leng nodded!

The Death Energy and Yin Energy was extremely helpful to the Hell Sect. It had been gathered over countless years, yet now, the Demon Wings of Death was leaving, and it was taking all of the energy with it. So, it was definitely a deep stab into the Hell Sect!

A'Leng glanced at the surroundings and smiled, “You dare not do anything?”

Huang Ying grinned, “They didn’t dare to before this, and now, they’re even more fearful.”

Now, the Demon Wings of Death was clearly on Yang Ye’s side, and with its help, the Four World Realm experts of the Hell Sect wouldn’t be able to fight back against Yang Ye at all!

Yang Ye had a bunch of extraordinary treasures!

Just like that, a long time passed before all the Death Energy and Yin Energy here had been completely absorbed by the Demon Wings of Death. Once it finished doing that, the Death Energy and Yin Energy contained within it even made Yang Ye and the others feel very fearful. Yang Ye was in a better state because he had the Eternal Energy and Primordial Violet Energy, so he was able to counter it quite a bit!

But A’Leng and Huang Ying didn’t!

They glanced at Yang Ye with a trace of fear in their eyes. Of course, it didn’t take long for the fear in their eyes to be converted into relief. Especially Huang Ying, he knew that he’d made the right bet!

The world wanted to annihilate Yang Ye and be Yang Ye’s enemy, but he, Huang Ying, decided to do the opposite! Of course, the final outcome would only be known once they returned to the desolate race’s territory!

Suddenly, the wings vanished on the spot, and then Yang Ye and the others watched with astonishment as a tiny pair of wings appeared behind Snowy!

It was the Demon Wings of Death!

All of them were stunned speechless.

Snowy blinked and returned to the Primordial Pagoda.

Erya hurried after her.

In the sky within the pagoda, a black shadow was ceaselessly zooming through the clouds, causing after images to fill the air!

Everyone else down below was looking up at it.

Erya licked her tanghulu and said, “So fast!” She gazed at the Primal True Dragon which was at the Four World Realm now and asked, “Dragon, can you catch up to her?”

After the battle at the Sword Ruins, their relationship had grown much better. The Primal True Dragon’s actions of bravely protecting Snowy without any fear of death had gained it a very good impression from Erya.

The dragon glanced at her and shook its head.

Even it couldn’t catch up to Snowy right now! It couldn’t keep up at all!

Erya licked the tanghulu and looked up at the sky, “Snowy, can you let me play with those wings too?”

As soon as she finished speaking, a shadow appeared before her. It was Snowy.

Snowy cracked a smile, and then the wings on her back appeared on Erya’s back. Erya glanced at them, and then she vanished on the spot.

A black shadow shot up into the clouds.

She was really fast!

Just like that, a long time passed before the Primal True Dragon suddenly asked, “Can I play too?”

It was a young dragon, so it was still very playful!

Erya appeared before Snowy and the Primal True Dragon. The dragon gazed at the wings with anticipation, but the wings suddenly transformed into a ray of light that slammed against the dragon.

Bang!

An explosion resounded, and the Primal True Dragon was blasted over 10km away.

This caused Oxxy, who wanted to give it a try too, to abandon any thoughts of that!

Snowy blinked and gazed at Erya, and the latter spoke indifferently, “Perhaps it’s too ugly!”

The Primal True Dragon was filled with sorrow when it heard this!

Outside the Primordial Pagoda, Yang Ye withdrew his divine sense from within it and gazed at A’Leng and Huang Ying, “Let’s go!”

The two of them exchanged glances and nodded, and then they vanished on the spot.

Yang Ye was about to leave when he suddenly looked to the right, “I’m taking the Demon Wings of Death. The Hell Sect doesn’t have anything to say about that, right?”

He received no reply!

Yang Ye continued, “I’m taking it even if you have objections.”

Yang Ye vanished on the spot once he finished speaking.

Once the three of them left, You Tian appeared here.

You Tian’s face was devoid of any expressions as he looked into the sky.

Someone had taken the Hell Sect’s most precious treasure right before his eyes, and even the Death Energy and Yin Energy in the cemetery had been completely extracted. Since the Hell Sect was established, it had never suffered such a terrible humiliation! It could be said that what Yang Ye said right before he left was a painful slap to the Hell Sect’s face.

Yang Ye!

You Tian closed his eyes slowly!

This time, he’d truly gotten to know the young man who had the Sprite Progenitor.

Revenge?

You Tian had such a thought, but how would the Hell Sect do that? By becoming a subordinate of other powers? That would work, but was it worth it? That young man wasn’t that easy to deal with! Once they failed to kill him, the Hell Sect would have to wait for his mad revenge.

A long time passed before You Tian sighed softly, “Ancestor, we are useless descendants!”

He turned around and left once he finished speaking, and his figure seemed quite desolate.

…

This time, no one obstructed Yang Ye’s group. While joining forces forced them to face many more enemies, it deterred many enemies as well. Under normal circumstances, if Huang Tianxing and Huang Ye joined forces, Huang Ying would definitely not be a match for them. However, with Yang Ye and A’Leng by his side, the situation was different. As for the powers that wished to kill Yang Ye, they had to worry about A’Leng and Huang Ying!

Similarly, if A’Leng’s clan wanted to force her into marriage, they would have to face Yang Ye and Huang Ying.

Under such circumstances, and especially after their joint forces had defeated Huang Tianxing and Huang Ye, no power dared to rashly act against them.

The powers in the Hell World didn’t dare to either!

After all, even the Hell Sect had yielded before them.

Just like that, their journey out of the Hell World was very smooth.

At a teleportation passageway, Yang Ye suddenly asked, “Are no Five World Realm experts acting against us?”

The Five World Realm!

He’d been puzzled for some time now. Five World Realm experts definitely existed in this world, but up until now, there had been no Five World Realm experts that acted against them!

A’Leng smiled, “Brother Yang, you may not be aware of this, but Five World Realm experts can’t just do as they please!”

Huang Ying nodded and explained, “The Five World Realm is a breaking point. They are the breaking point of this world. Let’s just use Eternal Border and the Hell World as an example. Once a Five World Realm expert comes here and attacks, it’s very likely to collapse and obliterate this world. Their strength is really capable of destroying this world.”

Yang Ye frowned slightly, “That isn’t the real reason they can’t do as they please, right?”

Huang Ying smiled, “Of course, the reason they can’t fight in most worlds is because of certain restrictions.”

Yang Ye asked, “From who?”

Huang Ying replied softly, “An elusive existence.”

Yang Ye asked, “Destiny?”

Huang Ying nodded, “In the past, an Five World Realm expert went to an ordinary world, but as soon as that expert fought, a bolt of Heavenly Lightning obliterated him. A dignified Five World Realm expert didn’t even have the chance to flee!”

He gazed at Yang Ye and continued, “Many do not know this but even someone as strong as my ancestor, the Desolate Emperor, didn’t fight in Eternal Border during the war with the Eternal Kingdom. Otherwise, Eternal Border would have been destroyed with a wave of his hand.”

Yang Ye spoke solemnly, “Was he afraid of Destiny?”

Huang Ying smiled, “I do not know. However, my ancestor once said that while the strong can do as they please, there are some rules that must be abided by, no matter how strong you are. Of course, the exception is if you’re really so strong to the point of being unmatched!”

Yang Ye’s pupils constricted.

Abide by the rules!

He’d heard someone say something similar.

Tian Xiu!

Tian Xiu had said something similar in the past.

So, it made Yang Ye wonder.

Is Tian Xiu in the Five World Realm?L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

…

Eternal Border. At the end of the Eternal River.

A petite young woman had her hands behind her back as she walked through the river. Her figure seemed composed as she strode on the river, and ripples undulated on the surface of it.

It didn’t take long for her to arrive before a wall of light.

The Universe Wall between Eternal Border and Eternal Kingdom!

She shot a glance to the side, and there were two corpses there.

She glanced at them for just a moment before moving her gaze away, and then she gazed at the wall of light.

Suddenly, the wall trembled, and then an old man in a luxurious robe walked out slowly from behind it.

Along with the arrival of the old man, the entire Eternal River’s waters started to roil!

Moreover, the space here started to turn ethereal.

A Five World Realm expert!

A true Five World Realm expert!

The old man shook his head slightly, “A low level world!”

As soon as he finished speaking, his aura grew weaker and weaker, and it didn’t take long for him to suppress his cultivation to the peak of the Four World Realm!

Meanwhile, the old man looked up at the sky, “Yang Ye? Interesting! I actually had to come here myself!”

Suddenly, the old man frowned slightly, and then he gazed at the young girl before him.

It was the first time he’d truly looked at her seriously!

The young girl looked him in the eyes, “Fuck off!”
