Chapter 1799 – The Prodigy Alliance!

Yang Ye turned to look towards the source of the voice. A young man in a luxurious robe had suddenly appeared there. The man was around the age of 25 or 26 and had silver hair. Actually, it wasn’t just his hair that was silver, his pupils were silver too.

Yang Ye asked, “You’re from Heaven Pillar Mountain?”

The young man nodded, “The Prodigy Alliance in Heaven Pillar Mountain, Fan Cang.”

“The Prodigy Alliance?” Yang Ye frowned, “I’ve never heard of it, and I’m not interested. If you’re here to kill me, then attack; if you aren’t, then turn around and walk away.”

Fan Cang pondered deeply for a moment and replied, “I was here for that, but not anymore.”

“Oh?” Yang Ye’s eyes had a trace of interest in them, “Why?”

Fan Cang replied, “Do you know what the Prodigy Alliance is?”

Yang Ye replied, “Please do tell.”

Fan Cang said, “There’s a group of monstrous geniuses in this world. They are unique. Just dozens of years of cultivation is enough for them to surpass tens of thousands of years that others spent cultivating. They can surmount their realms of cultivation to do battle. They are extraordinary geniuses. All of them went to Heaven Pillar Mountain because getting through that place is the only way for them to seek an even greater world, and only then can they experience an even more advanced system of cultivation.”

He gazed at Yang Ye and continued, “You’re a person like that!”

Yang Ye replied, “So what are you trying to say?”

Fan Cang said, “Join the Prodigy Alliance.”

Join the Prodigy Alliance!

Yang Ye sized up Fan Cang and replied, “I don’t really understand what you’re trying to say.”

Fan Cang explained, “There are all sorts of experts in Heaven Pillar Mountain, and they are mostly old geezers from many years ago. Besides them, there are also some other cultivators and ancient cultivators. Where there are people, there is competition. If you don’t stick together there, then it’s extremely easy for you to be unable to see the sunrise again. Especially when it’s someone new like you!”

Yang Ye asked, “Why?”

“Because they’re afraid!” Fan Cang continued, “If you’re given ten more years, then based on your natural talent and potential, they would probably be unable to subdue you. So, you should understand the rest, right?”

Yang Ye fell silent for a short while and replied, “What’s the benefit of joining the Prodigy Alliance?”

Fan Cang shook his head slightly, “That’s the wrong way to think about all of this. Firstly, you should be thinking about what you can bring to the Prodigy Alliance. Everything goes both ways. Before you take, you have to ask yourself what you can give, right?”

Yang Ye chuckled, “You’re right. But I have to warn you that I’m very good at causing trouble.”

Fan Cang looked Yang Ye in the eyes, “I wouldn’t have come to look for you if you weren’t. The kind and hesitant have been wiped out over there. Moreover, everyone in the Prodigy Alliance isn’t easy to deal with.”

Yang Ye replied, “I’m sure you’ve noticed that many people in Heaven Pillar Mountain want to kill me. If you make me join, aren’t you afraid that they’ll look for trouble with the Prodigy Alliance?”

Fan Cang shook his head slightly, “I think you’ve misunderstood. We’re an alliance, but we’re all free. There’s no superior or subordinate in the alliance. Joining will only provide you with a chance to become acquainted with the true monstrous geniuses of our medium universe. As for your problems, whether you’re able to make others help will depend on your own ability. If you don’t have the ability, you’ll have no choice but to deal with your own trouble on your own!”

“I see!” Yang Ye nodded slightly, “I roughly understand what you mean.” He gazed at Fan Cang and continued, “Why did you give up on killing me?”

Fan Cang fell silent for an instant and replied, “Because I’m not confident in my ability to kill you.”

“I see!” Yang Ye smiled, “You’re very confident!” While Fan Cang had said that he wasn't confident, it actually meant that he still had a chance to kill Yang Ye.

Fan Cang looked Yang Ye in the eye, “I could have killed that fellow, the Undertaker, as well!”

Yang Ye nodded. “Then you’re very strong!”

Fan Cang flipped his right hand, and a small command token appeared before Yang Ye, “This is an invitation token. If you’re willing, you can use it to contact me once you’ve arrived at Heaven Pillar Mountain!”

Yang Ye didn’t refuse. He took it and replied, “I’ll give it some thought!”

Fan Cang nodded, “Let me give you a friendly reminder. There are many people in Heaven Pillar Mountain who are targeting you. Moreover, many have set out. Supposedly, even ancient cultivators have left for you. So, be careful!”

He vanished on the spot once he finished speaking.

Ancient cultivators!

What were they? How terrifying were they?

The answer was obvious from how terrifying the woman in a red dress from Moment Mountain was. Because she was an ancient cultivator!

Endless troubles!

Suddenly, An Nanjing walked over to him, “Are you alright?”

Yang Ye gazed at her, and his heart hurt when he saw her empty right shoulder. Meanwhile, An Nanjing said, “It’s nothing!”

He shook his head slightly and pulled her into his arms. He didn’t speak and just hugged her.

Guilt!

An Nanjing had suffered too much because of him. He’d never told her that he was sorry or thanked her. Because it wasn’t necessary between them.

Just like that, they hugged in silence.

The members of the Wu Clan would naturally not disturb them, and they absolutely supported An Nanjing and Yang Ye’s relationship.

Even though An Nanjing didn’t belong to the Wu Clan, there was a deep link between them after what happened just now. At the very least, she would definitely not refuse if the Wu Clan needed help one day.

What did An Nanjing’s relationship with Yang Ye represent? Just think about it, would Yang Ye stand by idly while An Nanjing helped the Wu Clan?

However, Wu Wen was quite worried as well. Because the experts in Heaven Pillar Mountain seemed to intend to look for trouble with Yang Ye. So, if An Nanjing stayed with Yang Ye… In short, it was both a blessing and a disaster!

Cough!

Suddenly, a light cough resounded.

Yang Ye and An Nanjing split apart, and then Yang Ye looked towards the distance. Yang Lianshuang and the others had appeared over there.

Yang Lianshuang grinned, “We’re not disturbing both of you, right?”

Yang Ye didn’t answer her. He glanced at Nether Maiden and the others, and he asked, “How many did you kill?”

Yang Lianshuang spoke solemnly, “Around 20. However, Ying Yu and the five patriarchs escaped.”

“It’s fine!” Yang Ye continued, “After this incident, all five clans have suffered heavy losses. So, they can’t do anything now.”

Yang Lianshuang nodded, “I want to launch a counterattack. It’s the best opportunity for us to do so.” She paused for a moment and continued, “We must deal with the five clans before those fellows from Heaven Pillar Mountain arrive. Otherwise, we’ll be struck in between two groups of enemies!”

Yang Ye gazed at her, “Heaven Pillar Mountain is my own business. I’ll deal with it myself!”

Yang Lianshuang frowned slightly, “What are you talking about? What do you mean it’s your business? Your business is the Yang Clan’s business. The members of the Yang Clan go through thick and thin together!”

Yang Ye felt warm. He knew that Yang Lianshuang wasn’t trying to trick him or draw him over to her side. Because she wasn’t a person like that. She disdained to use such petty tricks.

Yang Ye was about to say something when Yang Lianshuang added, “Moreover, hasn’t this allowed you to realize something? Heaven Pillar Mountain won’t spare you, and they won’t spare anyone related to you. So, we must join forces against them!”

Yang Ye nodded, “Alright.”

Yang Lianshuang said, “I’ve decided to set out tomorrow. Our destination will be the Ying Clan. Once we annihilate the Ying Clan that is leading them, it’ll cause them to be without a leader, and then the other clans will be easier to deal with.”

She gazed at the Wu Clan’s Wu Ye and continued, “Senior Wu, what do you think?”

Wu Ye naturally understood what she meant. He fell silent for an instant, and then he nodded, “My Wu Clan is willing to fight with the Yang Clan!”

Yang Lianshuang instantly smiled. Now that they had the Wu Clan on their side, their chances of destroying the Ying Clan was naturally much higher.

Meanwhile, Wu Wen suddenly asked, “Why aren’t we attacking right now?”

Yang Lianshuang replied, “We’ve all exhausted too much strength during the last battle, so we need to recover. Moreover, both our clans need to prepare. Even if it’s a surprise attack, sufficient preparations should be made. A day is enough.”

They nodded to display their agreement.

Yang Lianshuang gazed at Wu Ye, “Senior Wu, shall we discuss the details?”

Wu Ye nodded slightly, “Please come with me!”

They vanished on the spot once he finished speaking.

Yang Ye gazed at Nether Maiden’s group, and then he flicked over 20 Energy Pearls to them, “Rest well. I’ll still be needing your help tomorrow!” He would naturally hesitate to seek their help, nor was it necessary! 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

They took the Energy Pearls and vanished on the spot.

This time, they were here to gain Yang Ye’s help, but they were also here to help Yang Ye.

In a room, Yang Ye took An Nanjing’s hand and entered the Primordial Pagoda.

Yang Ye wanted to help her restore her arm. Even though it had been severed by a unique form of energy, it wasn’t a problem for the Primordial Pagoda’s violet energy.

Two hours later, her arm had been regrown.

However, Skysplit couldn’t be repaired.

Yang Ye rubbed her head gently and said, “It’s fine. We can find a better one in the future.”

She shook her head slightly. She picked up the two halves of Skysplit and said, “I’ll use dual spears from now on.”

Yang Ye nodded, “Alright! We’ll find a way to reforge Skysplit one day!” Skysplit had been with her for so many years, so how could she just give it up?

An Nanjing nodded slightly and gazed at Skysplit while a trace of sorrow could be seen in her eyes.

Yang Ye was about to speak when he suddenly frowned, and then he left the Primordial Pagoda. There was a person in his room — Yang Lianshuang.

Yang Ye asked, “What is it?”

She replied, “The Ying Clan sent someone.”

Yang Ye asked, “Why?”

She glanced at him and said, “To seek peace!”

Peace!
