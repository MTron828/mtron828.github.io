Chapter 2434 – All it Takes is One Swing of the Sword!

In the Primordial Pagoda, Yang Ye was stunned for a moment when he heard Erya, and then he hurriedly took Snowy and left the pagoda.

He was quite afraid of her.

When she was hungry, she wanted to eat people!

But where would he find people for her to eat?

Run!

Erya searched for Yang Ye throughout the Primordial Pagoda. She searched for a while before realizing that Yang Ye wasn’t inside the pagoda, so she quickly left it.

Yang Ye’s face stiffened when he saw her outside the pagoda, and he smiled embarrassedly, “Erya, what is it?”

She walked over to him, “Big Brother Yang, I’m hungry. What do you think we should do?”

Yang Ye laughed bitterly.

Her hunger was unlike other demon beasts. Meat like beef and lamb were available in the world of mortals, and so long as he had enough silver, he could buy as much as she wanted. But Erya refused to eat that! She wanted to eat very high level demons like the Primal True Dragon and Primal Vicious Tiger.

Even when she ate humans, she had to pick those extraordinarily powerful experts!

She ate energy! She wanted to absorb energy!

Erya grabbed Yang Ye’s arm and said, “Big Brother Yang, you promised my grandfather to take good care of me. Now, I’m really hungry every day, so you must find me food!”

Yang Ye’s face darkened.

You’re not eating food, you’re eating people!

Yang Ye couldn’t take her constant complaining and was forced to agree to get her food as soon as possible. Once Yang Ye struck his chest and guaranteed it, Erya finally left Yang Ye alone.

Yang Ye heaved a sigh of relief when he saw her return to the Primordial Pagoda. He was really quite afraid of that little girl.

Yang Ye gazed at Huang Ying, and he saw five black clothed figures around Huang Ying. They surrounded him at the center and protected him well.

Meanwhile, strands of energy were ceaselessly rippling out of him. He seemed to be doing something.

Yang Ye moved his gaze away and scanned the surroundings. There were numerous extremely hidden auras in the surroundings.

Yang Ye fell silent for a moment, and then he vanished on the spot.

Hiss!

A ray of sword energy flashed through the sky.

High above in the sky, a middle aged man’s expression changed drastically the instant Yang Ye’s figure vanished. It was because the sword energy was shooting in his direction.

He’d been discovered.

The middle aged man turned around to flee, but a sword had arrived.

He couldn’t escape!

The middle aged man clenched his fists and slammed them forward, causing the space there to explode apart.

However, as soon as the sword arrived, the middle aged man was sliced into two!

After he instantly killed the middle aged man, Erya appeared before Yang Ye. She didn’t eat the man. She just opened her mouth and sucked in the man’s soul and energy.

She stopped eating flesh now because it was tasteless. The flesh of demon beasts was tasty, but she only absorbed the energy and souls of humans.

It was slightly similar to Yang Ye’s Soul Devouring Technique.

Just like that, a short while passed before she patted her stomach and returned to the Primordial Pagoda with satisfaction.

While the soul and energy of a Four World Realm expert wasn’t sufficient to fill her stomach, it could stop her from feeling that hungry.

Yang Ye glanced at the corpse and was about to leave when he looked to the right. A woman was walking over slowly from there.

She was none other than A’Leng whom he’d last seen in Divine Martial World.

Yang Ye spoke indifferently, “Do you need something?”

She walked over to him and said, “Brother Yang, it’s been some time!”

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and asked, “Are you from the Di Clan?”

She shook her head, “No, and neither was Senior Heaven whom you killed earlier. I didn’t send him to attack you either. It was my clan that sent him. My clan is from Eternal Kingdom.”

Eternal Kingdom!

Yang Ye frowned slightly, “You’re from Eternal Kingdom?”

A'Leng nodded, “I presume Huang Ying told you a little. My clan wishes to join forces with the Di Clan to do something, and for the sake of strengthening our relationship, they decided to sacrifice me.”

She grinned at this point, “I don’t like being manipulated by others.”

Meanwhile, Huang Ying walked over and smiled, “Brother Yang, allow me to introduce her. This is Miss A’Leng. She’s from the Eternal Kingdoms’ Yuan Clan.”

Yang Ye glanced at him, “She is the help you were talking about?”

Huang Ying smiled, “Yes.”

Yang Ye nodded, “Shall we go now?”

Huang Ying shot a glance down below, and the five black clothed figures suddenly vanished on the spot. A short while later, a black clothed figure appeared before Huang Ying but vanished soon after.

Huang Ying shot a glance into the distance and smiled, “Brother Yang, since we’re here in Hell World, we have to take some things before we leave. Don’t you think so too?”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and smiled, “That’s exactly what I was thinking!”

Huang Ying chuckled and vanished on the spot with Yang Ye and A’Leng.

Hell Sect.

The Hell Sect could be described as the largest and strongest power in Hell World. No other could compare to it. Even the Guardian of Hell World was from the Hell Sect.

Hell Sect was situated in a gorge, and within the gorge was a blood red pavilion. There were mountains all around the gorge, and experts were standing guard on all the mountains. It wasn’t just experts, there were formations too.

Beyond a mountain range behind Hell Sect was an endless cemetery. Tomb after tomb stood there in the cemetery, and they formed quite a horrifying and dense mass of tombs.

Countless strands of Death Energy converged in the boundless cemetery, and the Death Energy and Yin Energy here covered the sky to the point even sun could not pass through them.

This cemetery could truly be described as a place forbidden to living people!

Not to mention outsiders, even some disciples of the Hell Sect didn’t dare to rashly step foot in the cemetery.

Suddenly, three figures soundlessly appeared in the cemetery.

It was Yang Ye’s group of three.

There was a strand of mysterious energy around them which kept them hidden. So, their auras didn’t leak out at all.

The Sword Domain!

The mysterious energy was Yang Ye’s Sword Domain.

Huang Ying glanced at Yang Ye and smiled, “Yang Ye, your Sword Domain is extraordinary.’

A’Leng smiled too, “Indeed. Your skill in concealment is very rarely seen.”

The Sword Domain formed a world of its own, so unless someone’s strength far surpassed Yang Ye by too much, it would be impossible for them to sense his aura.

Yang Ye nodded, glanced at the surroundings, and said, “Brother Ying, why have you brought us here?”

Huang Ying smiled, “There’s a treasure here that belongs to the Hell Sect. Since we’re leaving, we naturally should take something with us. Of course, let me be clear. The divine treasures of the world fall to those who are fated to have them. So, we’ll allow that treasure to determine who it wishes to go with and avoid harming our own relationships. What do both of you think?”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and nodded, “Alright!”

A'Leng glanced at Yang Ye and said, “Alright!”

Huang Ying grinned and walked forward. He spoke as he walked, “You may not know much about this place. This is the core area of the Hell Sect. All those years ago, the ancestor of the Hell Sect was an extraordinary expert, and he cultivated the Death Dao. The Death Dao is the Dao of the dead.”

He pointed forward with his right hand, “This cemetery was intentionally constructed by the Hell Sect. Every moment of the day, they gather many dead bodies and bring them here. Of course, they killed for dead bodies in the beginning, but their actions infuriated many powers. After numerous wars, the Hell Sect restrained themselves slightly.”

Yang Ye asked, “Why do they gather so many dead bodies here?”

Huang Ying smiled, “They gather Death Energy and Yin Energy. The cultivation technique of the Hell Sect is a little special. They don’t just cultivate profound energy, they cultivate in Death Energy and Yin Energy too. Simply speaking, the disciples of the Hell Sect are quite evil indeed.”

He seemed to have thought of something at this point and added, “The ancestor of the Hell Sect cultivated an extremely supreme form of profound energy all those years ago, the Death Yin Energy. Eternal Energy is the only energy among the ten great energies that can suppress it. As for the rest, even the Primordial Violet Energy cannot suppress it.”

Death Yin Energy!

Yang Ye nodded and didn’t ask any further questions. However, he’d committed that name to his memory.

Just like that, they continued forward. But it didn’t take long for numerous obscure auras to appear in the surroundings.

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings and remained silent.

It didn’t take long for an old man to appear in front of them. Yang Ye had met this old man in the past, it was the old man from the Hell Sect who’d come to give them a warning before this.

The old man glanced at them, and he gazed at Huang Ying in the end, “Ninth Prince, what is the meaning of this?”

“What?” Huang Ying grinned, “I don’t know what you mean.”

The old man spoke solemnly, “You can leave yourself. We will absolutely not try to stop you. It’s an order from our sect master.”

Huang Ying shook his head, “I don’t want to leave for now. I’d like to take a stroll around. What? I can’t?”

The old man’s face was quite gloomy, “Ninth Prince, this is a forbidden area of my Hell Sect, and outsiders are prohibited from entering. Please be understanding, Ninth Prince.”

“A forbidden area?” Huang Ying was stunned and said, “Why don’t I know about that? I…”

Suddenly, Yang Ye vanished on the spot. The old man’s expression changed drastically the instant Yang Ye vanished. He took a step back, overlapped his palms, and pressed them forward.

The space before him instantly warped, and a wave of powerful energy rippled out from it.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye’s sword left its sheath.

Five swings with the Sword Domain!

Hiss!

As soon as they descended, the space in front of Yang Ye was sliced open like a piece of paper.Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

An instant later, Yang Ye was behind the old man, and the latter’s body had been split into two.

A single attack!

Yang Ye sheathed his sword and gazed at Huang Ying, “All it takes is one swing of the sword, so why waste your breath?”

Huang Ying was stunned speechless.
