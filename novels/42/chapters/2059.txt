Chapter 2060 – Prehistoric Ruins!

A sword howl resounded and Yang Ye’s figure shot forward.

He was already extremely swift, and coupled with the Divine Wings, his speed was so swift that everyone couldn’t see him clearly. Powerful sword energy and extremely swift speeds tore open the space in Yang Ye’s path.

The woman and the middle aged man’s expressions became completely solemn at this moment.

They’d realized that they’d far underestimated the young man before them.

But they didn’t have the time to think because the sword energy had arrived before them.

The middle aged man, Huang Nian, took a small step forward and raised both his hands slightly, a moment later, he slapped them forward.

Bang!

A wave of powerful force swept forward. As soon as it came into contact with Yang Ye’s sword energy, space shook violently while the powerful force of the collision pushed Huang Nian back repeatedly.

Suddenly, the woman in red clothes stretched out her right hand, and a ray of red light flashed. If one looked carefully, one would notice that there was an extremely thin red string within the red light.

Yang Ye raised his sword and swung it in response.

The red light was instantly sliced into two, but the red string was still there. Moreover, it had arrived before Yang Ye and seemed to be about to shoot straight through Yang Ye’s chest.

This caught Yang Ye off guard.

The red string had stopped just half an inch before Yang Ye’s chest because Yang Ye was holding tightly to it. However, the powerful energy it carried caused Yang Ye’s entire arm to tremble.

“Explode!” The woman’s voice resounded. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Boom!

The red thread in Yang Ye’s grasp exploded apart, and Yang Ye was instantly blasted over 3km away.

However, the woman’s face fell because Yang Ye was fine. A huge ethereal white dragon had appeared behind Yang Ye, and his body was covered in white light. The force of the explosion from the red thread had been completely blocked off by the white light!

The woman wasn’t the only one with an unsightly expression on her face, it was the same for Huang Nian. He hadn’t expected the young man’s physical strength to be that formidable.

As for the middle aged man with a spear on his back, a wisp of surprise had flashed through his eyes, and there was curiosity in his eyes as he gazed at the ethereal dragon behind Yang Ye.

Yang Ye cracked his neck, and then he took a step forward. Dozens of swords instantly appeared here, and as soon as Yang Ye took another step forward, a wave of mysterious energy appeared here.

The Sword Domain.

The middle aged man and the woman were at the Major Zen Realm, so he couldn’t deal with both of them without revealing a trump card of his.

As soon as the Sword Domain and those energy swords appeared, the middle aged man and woman’s faces finally changed!

Even Han Yi had undisguised shock in his eyes.

The Sword Domain!

At their level of cultivation, they naturally knew about the Sword Domain and had even seen some other ‘Domains’. But the Sword Domain was quite rare!

Yet now, they hadn’t expected to see it being possessed by such a young man.

At this instant, the woman felt slight regret. She regretted not making concessions. If she had, they wouldn’t have to fight to the death now. Moreover, since the young man possessed such strength at his age and had even comprehended the Sword Domain, it was obvious that an extraordinary organization stood behind him!

In short, it was a huge problem for them!

But at this moment, they didn’t have the time to think about that because they had to deal with Yang Ye’s swords!

Yang Ye slowly closed his eyes. As soon as his eyes were fully shut, the over 30 ethereal swords in the surroundings suddenly started to spin. In an instant, rays of light crisscrossed and enveloped both the middle aged man and beautiful woman in an instant.

Explosions resounded from within the rays of light, and it continued for almost 15 minutes before they gradually vanished.

Yang Ye appeared before Li Shui’shui and Wo You again, and they heaved slight sighs of relief when they saw that he was still alive.

It wasn’t that they cared a lot about him. But they were with him right now, and they would definitely be unable to escape a terrible fate if Yang Ye died.

Huang Nian and the woman were still in front of Yang Ye, and they were alive. But they were heavily injured.

Huang Nian’s arms were gone, and the woman was worse. Her entire body was covered in dozens of injuries and half her face was gone. She wasn’t beautiful anymore now, and she looked quite terrifying instead.

However, Yang Ye had no intention of stopping. He held his sword in hand as he walked slowly in their direction. Meanwhile, the young man who fought Yang Ye earlier, the son of Huang Nian and the woman, suddenly appeared not too far away from Yang Ye, “What will it take to make you stop?”

Yang Ye gazed at the woman, “Didn’t she want my arms? Now, I’ll take her life!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye was about to attack again. But Han Yi suddenly appeared in front of Yang Ye. Han Yi sized up Yang Ye and said, “Please show mercy.”

Yang Ye looked Han Yi in the eyes, “Give me a reason!”

Han Yi grinned, “Didn’t you want to head inside? We’ll let you go in. Is that enough?”

Yang Ye spoke indifferently, “Can you stop me?”

“Of course!” Han Yi smiled, “There are 23 Major Zen Realm experts here, and a Half-Step Sage Realm expert. Do you think that you can fight all of us?”

Meanwhile, Li Shui’shui suddenly asked, “There are so many experts here?”

Han Yi nodded slightly and glanced at Yang Ye, “Young Brother, we’re all here for Originite or some other things, so it isn’t necessary to fight to the death. Brother Huang Nian’s family are in the wrong for what happened earlier, so I apologize on their behalf. Now, I officially invite all three of you to join us and search for those mysterious Originite. I wonder if you’re willing to do that?”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and smiled, “Of course.”

Yang Ye put his sword away.

Actually, he’d sensed numerous powerful auras in the surroundings from the very beginning. He was naturally not afraid of them, but while he wasn’t afraid, it didn’t represent that he had to fight them to the death. He hadn’t fought Huang Nian and the woman because he felty unhappy.

Yang Ye wasn’t that petty!

He’d mainly done so to display his strength and obtain their acknowledgment. Only then would they allow him, Li Shui’shui, and Wo You to join them. Now, he’d accomplished his objective.

As for Huang Nian’s family, he didn’t care about them at all. It was extremely difficult for Major Zen Realm experts to kill him. Because the physical defense he gained from utilizing the Sky Dragon was sufficient to throw many Major Zen Realm experts into despair.

Huang Nian and his family clearly heaved sighs of relief when they heard that Yang Ye was willing to stop. If Yang Ye refused, then while they wouldn’t die because Han Yi and the others wouldn’t just stand by idly, they would be unable to avoid being kicked out from the group.

Han Yi walked over to Yang Ye, “Young Brother, what’s your name?”

Yang Ye replied, “Yang Ye!”

Han Yi nodded, “Come. Let me tell you about this place.”

It didn’t take long for them to vanish on the spot, and Han Yi led them to the entrance of the place. There were over a dozen people here, and the weakest amongst them was at the Major Zen Realm!

All of them gazed at Yang Ye’s group when they arrived, or to be more precise, they were looking at Yang Ye. All of them nodded slightly as a form of greeting when Yang Ye gazed at them.

They’d naturally witnessed the battle just now.

It was naturally easy for those with strength to be acknowledged by others.

Yang Ye nodded slightly in response as well. That was how he did things. If others respected him, he would respect them too.

Human relationships were a mutual thing!

Han Yi pointed towards the distance, “See that?”

Yang Ye looked over. He saw a huge circular iron door, and it was the entrance to the building before him that seemed like a huge top.

Yang Ye asked, “It can’t be opened?”

Han Yi shook his head, “It can. But we dare not go in!”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Why?”

Han Yi explained, “Because anyone who goes in will just die mysteriously. A few of us have already gone in, and all of them vanished without a trace. Moreover, we heard their horrified cries before they died.”

Yang Ye asked, “There’s something in there?”

Han Yi laughed bitterly, “We know nothing about what’s in there. However, we must go inside soon. Otherwise, it may vanish soon.”

“Vanish?” Yang Ye gazed at Han Yi, “Why?”

Han Yi explained, “It vanishes from time to time, and then it reappears somewhere else. We don’t know why it does that. This planet isn’t huge, but it isn’t tiny either. So, if it vanishes, it will take quite a bit of effort for us to find it again. Moreover, the four paths and some other mysterious organizations may have sent their forces by now. Once they arrive and uncover the secrets of this Secret Realm, then there won’t be anything left for us.”

He took a deep breath and continued, “Now, we’re planning to make one last attempt.”

Yang Ye asked, “How?”

Han Yi looked up into the distance, “Break through by force and not go through the front door.”

Yang Ye looked off into the distance. As he gazed at the huge building before him, Yang Ye felt quite uncomfortable. He sensed danger.

The Prehistoric Civilization?

All of this was left behind by the people of the Prehistoric Civilization. What was their civilization in the Martial Dao like?

Perhaps many answers are hidden in there.
