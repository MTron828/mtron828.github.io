Chapter 1001 – Only One Of Us Will Survive This Battle!

The disciples of the Dao Order revealed slightly grim expressions. Could he be planning on killing Elder Zhu Yuan?

Zhu Yuan’s eyes narrowed slightly as he turned around to look at Yang Ye, “What? Are you sure that you want me and the disciples of my Dao Order to stay?”

Yang Ye chuckled, “I Yang Ye, repay both kindness and enmity. I owe a debt to the founding ancestor of the Dao Order, so I will absolutely not act against members of the Dao Order if they don’t try to act against me. Thus, besides you, all the other disciples of the Dao Order can leave.”

Zhu Yuan stared at Yang Ye as he said, “Are you sure that you can make me stay?”

Bang!

The cape on Yang Ye’s back suddenly unfolded into a pair of wings, and he pointed Yellow Springs at Zhu Yuan, “Want to give it a try?”

As soon as he finished speaking, Qing and the Sword Servant, Li Yun, flashed forward and surrounded Zhu Yuan from both sides.

Zhu Yuan slowly clenched his fist tightly, and his eyes flickered with ghastly killing intent and coldness.

“Yang Ye!” Suddenly, Fu Jinxian said, “I know that you don’t fear the Dao Order, but do you really want the Dao Order to become enemies of Ocean of Clouds Academy as well? Can the academy really afford to endure the Dao Order’s revenge right now?”

Yang Ye gazed at Fu Jinxian and said, “They won’t stop even if I do, right?”

“You killed Qing Daofu, so they will absolutely not stop!” Fu Jinxian looked Yang Ye in the eyes and said, “However, even if we intend to take revenge, it would only be against you and not the entire academy or the Ancient Sword School. But if you kill Elder Zhu Yuan, then trust me, the Dao Order will immediately change sides, and it will side with Welkin Wolf Mountain Range. At that time, the academy and the Ancient Sword School will fall into a hopeless situation!”

Yang Ye fell silent. Meanwhile, Yu Wushuang walked over to his side, “Even though I want him dead as well, but the Dao Order will definitely not let the matter go if you are to kill him now. Regardless of whether it’s the academy or the sword school, both of them can’t afford to endure the Dao Order’s revenge right now.”

“If you spare him, then there would be room for both the academy and the Dao Order to discuss things; if you kill him, then the Dao Order would be forced to attack Ocean of Clouds Academy even if it didn’t want to become enemies with the academy.” Lu Wan’er continued, “Let him go. I know you don’t like it, but do it for the academy and everyone here in the city, alright?”

Yang Ye remained silent for a long while, and then he glanced at the crowd of cultivators from the city. He shrugged and gazed at Zhu Yuan, “Alright, you can go now!”

Fu Jinxian and the other members of the Dao Order instantly heaved sighs of relief when they heard him. Yang Ye had 2 Saints on his side, so it was very likely for him to be able to kill Zhu Yuan. Most importantly, it would definitely cause the Dao Order to become enemies with both the Ancient Sword School and Ocean of Clouds Academy. Something like that wasn’t good for the Dao Order, the Ancient Sword School, or Ocean of Clouds Academy.

Fortunately, Yang Ye didn’t act willfully this time!

Zhu Yuan glanced coldly at Yang Ye, Yu Wushuang, and Lu Wan’er, “Remember that I’ll definitely repay you a hundredfold for everything that happened today!”

Fu Jinxian’s face turned pale when she heard him, “It’s over now!”

“I think you don’t have to go now!” Yang Ye’s voice resounded abruptly, and then a ray of light tore through the sky and shot towards Zhu Yuan.

It was quick! Quick to the absolute limit! Besides Qing and Zhu Yuan, no other human or demon beast could capture it clearly.

Zhu Yuan’s expression had changed drastically when Yang Ye attacked. Because he hadn’t expected Yang Ye to actually change his mind and attack immediately!

Zhu Yuan didn’t dare act carelessly at all, and he stretched out his right hand. The space before him condensed and overlapped in layers, and it instantly formed a thick spatial wall.

Bang!

Yang Ye stabbed Yellow Springs right against the spatial wall, and it shook violently from the impact. A moment later, Yang Ye suddenly spun Yellow Springs.

Bang!

A loud explosion resounded as the spatial wall exploded apart, and the ray of light shot towards Zhu Yuan.

Zhu Yuan’s eyelids twitched, and a silver spear which was thick like an arm appeared in his grasp. He shouted with fury as he stabbed it against the tip of Yang Ye’s sword.

Bang!

An explosion resounded as a wave of energy swept out from the point of collision. At this moment, the sky instantly cracked apart, and numerous spatial rifts filled the sky. It was an extremely shocking sight to behold!

Yang Ye’s Void Rank sword intent surged out incessantly from within him and pressed down upon Zhu Yuan. At the same time, Zhu Yuan relied on the energy of the heavens and the earth to resist Yang Ye’s sword intent. They fell into a momentary stalemate.

Yang Ye’s sword howled incessantly while Zhu Yuan’s spear trembled without end.

The space around them couldn’t endure the power force from the collision, and it collapsed. But it didn’t take long for the Laws of the heavens and the earth to repair the space. However, it was blasted apart as soon as it was repaired!

Yu Wushuang gazed at Qing, and the latter shook her head lightly, “If I attack now, then I’ll have to enter a pocket of space with Zhu Yuan, but Yang Ye can’t do that. Don’t worry. I’ll lend him a hand if he can’t hold on.” Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Yu Wushuang nodded, and then she looked up into the sky.

After Yang Ye and Zhu Yuan were locked in a stalemate for some time, the spectators noticed to their astonishment that Zhu Yuan’s spear was actually gradually curving!

At this moment, Zhu Yuan who was a Saint had fallen into a disadvantaged state!

Suddenly, Yang Ye moved Yellow Springs a little bit to the side, and it transformed into a ray of light that smashed against Zhu Yuan’s chest. At the same time, Zhu Yuan’s spear stabbed Yang Ye’s chest!

Bang! Bang!

2 explosions resounded. Yang Ye was blasted 300m back while Zhu Yuan was pushed just 30m back. However, there was a bloody hole on Zhu Yuan’s chest while Zhu Yuan’s spear hadn’t even left a mark behind on Yang Ye’s chest. It was naturally because of the Sword Armor!

The reason Yang Ye had dared to exchange blows like that was because he was wearing the Sword Armor. The facts proved that he really didn’t have to defend himself against Zhu Yuan’s attacks while wearing the Sword Armor!

If he didn’t have the Sword Armor, then Yang Ye would naturally not dare to use his body to forcefully endure the full strength of a Saint. Even though his physical defenses were formidable, they weren’t strong enough to disregard a Saint! However, it was a completely different story when he had the Sword Armor. Because the Sword Armor which was boosted by his Void Rank sword intent was something that even Saints would find difficult to penetrate!

The corners of Yang Ye’s mouth curled into a smile. Because he was entirely capable of fighting a Saint in single combat while he possessed the equipment provided to him by the Ancient Sword School! Actually, it was normal because he was using the best equipment in the Ancient Sword School. Not to mention him, even an ordinary person would probably be able to exchange a few blows with a Monarch Realm expert while utilizing such equipment!

At this moment, Zhu Yuan had an extremely unsightly and ferocious expression on his face. After all, he’d actually been publicly injured by an ant at the Half-Saint Realm!

It was a humiliation! An absolute humiliation!

“Die!” Zhu Yuan roared with fury as his figure flashed up into the air. He stretched out his right hand, and the spirit energy throughout the surrounding instantly surged towards him. In the end, all the spirit energy entered his body.

Zhu Yuan slowly raised his hands in midair, and the clouds above him immediately started moving. It only took a moment for the clouds to slowly split apart, and then a huge palm which emanated an ancient aura descended down as if it had traveled down from outer space itself.

The palm emanated a powerful wave of energy that was even slightly stronger than the energy of the heavens and the earth!

Everyone here was astounded by the sight of the palm.

In the past, Saints had always entered pockets of space to do battle, so besides Saints themselves, others were very rarely able to witness the true strength of Saints. All they knew was that Saints were very strong, but they didn’t know how strong Saints were. Now, they knew.

They had no doubt that Ocean of Clouds City and Welkin Wolf Mountain Range would be obliterated if that palm was allowed to descend!

“Isn’t he afraid of breaking the rules of the Radiant Dimension and being pursued by all the Saints in this world?” asked Yu Wushuang. Because Zhu Yuan’s attack was sufficient to obliterate the entire area here.

Qing shook her head slightly, “His opponent isn’t a Saint. Since it isn’t a Saint, he naturally has no need to obey those so-called rules. Moreover, unless 2 Saints go mad and start destroying the world around them, very few Saints would emerge from their own closed door cultivation and interfere in it.”

“I see!” Yu Wushuang nodded slightly, and then she gazed at Yang Ye while a trace of worry flashed through her eyes.

Can Yang Ye resist that attack?

Will Yang Ye be the 1st person in the history of Pine Prefecture to kill a Saint while at the Half-Saint Realm?

Yu Wushuang wasn’t the only one wondering about such things, everyone else here had similar thoughts.

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly as he gazed at the enormous palm, and there was a solemn expression in his eyes. He’d killed a Saint in the past, but he’d done so by utilizing surprise attacks. At that time, Li Yuan hadn’t been able to truly utilize his strength. Yet now, Yang Ye was facing a Saint directly, a Saint who was able to utilize his full strength in battle!

Yang Ye slowly looked down at Yellow Springs, and then a moment of silence ensued before Yellow Springs suddenly howled. Its sword howl caused countless strands of earthen yellow energy to surge out from the ground and into Yang Ye, and then his aura and the aura of his sword shot into the sky and collided with the aura emanated from the enormous palm.

The auras collided in midair, and the entire sky warped as if it was about to collapse!

“Yang Ye, let me see how much of a monstrous genius you are!” Zhu Yuan’s voice resounded like a thunderclap, and then the huge palm smashed down from up above.

“Only one of us will survive this battle!” Yang Ye roared as a sword howl resounded, and then he transformed into a ray of light that tore through space as it shot towards the enormous palm.
