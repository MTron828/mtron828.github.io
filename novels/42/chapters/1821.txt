Chapter 1822 – Can I Surrender?

Leave the sword behind or die!

Blood Maiden and the others’ expressions turned gloomy when they heard the person’s voice.

Obviously, it was impossible to resolve this peacefully!

Yang Ye gazed at the City Governor’s Estate in silence for a long time, and then he said, “I don’t want any trouble!”

The voice resounded again, “Then leave the sword behind!” Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

A smile curled up on the corners of Yang Ye’s mouth, “I don’t want trouble, but I’m not afraid of it. I’m right here, and so is the sword. If you have the ability, then come get it?”

Creak!

Suddenly, the door to the estate opened slowly, and then a middle aged man in a luxurious robe walked out from within.

The middle aged man stopped around 300m away from Yang Ye’s group. He sized them up, and then his gaze descended onto the wooden sword in Yang Ye’s grasp. He looked at it in silence for a short while, and then he looked up at Yang Ye, “If you were smart, you would have given it up. With the natural talent you possess, you may not even need it to ascend to the large universe in the future!”

Yang Ye chuckled, “You’re right, but I’m really unable to abandon it just to live. Moreover, it’s mine, so why should I give it to someone else?”

The middle aged man gazed at Yang Ye for a long time and nodded, “Right, it’s normal for a person like you to have a temper. Since that’s the case, there’s no need to say anything else.”

He glanced at the surroundings and continued, “Everyone, my Nangong Clan’s strength isn’t sufficient to kill them. However, if everyone in the city joins forces, then it shouldn’t be a problem to kill all of them. So, if you intend to fight for the sword, then please come forward, and then we’ll join forces against them; if you refuse, then my Nangong Clan will have no choice but to deactivate the formation and allow them to leave!”

Deactivate the formation!

Many experts hiding in the shadows couldn’t stay calm anymore.

Once Yang Ye’s group was allowed to leave the city, then so long as they went into hiding, no one would be able to find Yang Ye’s group!

So, many started to become quite anxious.

However, no one stepped forward either.

They wanted to sit and watch the battle before reaping the rewards!

Meanwhile, the middle aged man added, “Since you’re not stepping forward, then my Nangong Clan will be forced to deactivate the formation.”

Suddenly, an old man appeared here. The old man gazed at the middle aged man, “City Governor Nangong, you can’t deactivate it. If you do, it’ll be difficult to find Yang Ye again!”

The middle aged man glanced at the old man and replied, “Oh, Senior Lu Gu. What? Are you representing the others who’re still hiding?”

“Sort of!” Lu Gu continued, “City Governor Nangong, we can join forces, but I’d like to know who’ll get the wooden sword once Yang Ye is killed. It isn’t something that only I would like to know, even the others would like to know the answer as well!”

The middle aged man, Nangong Tian, smiled, “I’ve naturally thought about that. There’s only one sword but so many here. So, some will gain nothing after risking their lives in battle.”

He paused for a moment and continued, “I have a way to overcome that. So, how about I hold a competition after we get the sword. The strongest wins and takes the sword. Of course, it’s fine if you don’t get the sword because my Nangong Clan is willing to give every one of you a Lifespan Fruit that increases your lifespan by 100 years!”

A Lifespan Fruit!

Lu Gu’s expression became quite solemn once he heard Nangong Tian.

After attaining the 6th stage of the True Realm, ordinary techniques weren’t very enticing to them anymore. The only thing that was extremely enticing to them was treasures that could increase their lifespan.

A hundred extra years were sometimes able to change a person’s fate.

Lu Gu nodded slightly, “The Nangong Clan is wealthy indeed. I think that it works for us!”

As soon as he finished speaking, the space behind him trembled, and then over 40 people appeared here.

All of them were 6th stage True Realm experts!

Nangong Tian glanced at them, and then he waved his right hand. Ten men in silver armor instantly appeared behind him.

52 6th stage True Realm experts!

Needless to say, it was an extremely terrifying force. However, it was normal because practically all the 6th stage True Realm experts in the medium universe were gathered here in Heaven Pillar Mountain. Moreover, even if there weren’t tens of thousands of 6th stage True Realm experts in the medium universe, a few thousand definitely existed!

The group of 52 6th stage True Realm experts gazed at Yang Ye’s group.

Meanwhile, Nangong Tian suddenly said, “Leave the sword behind and you can leave. Alright?”

Blood Maiden and the others gazed at Yang Ye.

Yang Ye looked down at the wooden sword in his grasp. He could leave safely if he handed it over. Moreover, no one would come looking for trouble with him anymore. But could he?

He couldn’t!

Because if he did, even he would look down on himself. Moreover, it would go against his Sword Dao.

His Sword Dao was one where he would rather die than submit!

Giving the sword away to survive would be no different than that!

So, he couldn’t hand it over!

Yang Ye looked up at Nangong Tian, “It’s right over here. Come get it if you can!”

The atmosphere here instantly became tense when they heard him.

Blood Maiden and the others had calm expressions on their faces, and they weren’t surprised at all. Because they knew him well. He was someone who never gave in to threats. So, making him yield was just a dream!

Nangong Tian and the others’ faces fell when they heard Yang Ye. If they were being honest, they didn’t want to fight Yang Ye’s group to the death. Even though they had a crushing advantage in numbers, the experts on Yang Ye’s side weren’t ordinary at all. So, if they fought to the death, it would absolutely cause both sides to suffer tremendous losses!

Thus, they hoped that Yang Ye would hand the sword over, but they hadn’t expected him to still refuse under such circumstances!

Nangong Tian gazed at Yang Ye for a long time and nodded, “Since that’s the case, then just die!”

He waved his right hand once he finished speaking. In an instant, the barrier of light in the sky trembled, and then beams of light descended from above. These beams were aimed at Yang Ye, Blood Maiden, and the others!

A vicious glow flashed through Yang Ye’s eyes, and he was about to attack. However, Blood Maiden suddenly grabbed his arm and shook her head. After that, she gazed at Blind Maiden.

The latter nodded slightly and floated up into the air.

Yang Ye asked, “Will she be alright?”

Blood Maiden gazed at Blind Maiden. “When she opens her eyes, even our eldest sister has to avoid her!”

Yang Ye was stunned speechless.

Blind Maiden stopped in midair, and then she looked up. After that, she removed the cloth which covered her eyes.

In an instant, two beams of golden light surged out from her eyes, and then the entire sky was covered by those two beams of golden light. At the same time, hissing resounded throughout the sky.

At this moment, no one here could open their eyes!

Even if he covered his eyes with sword intent, Yang Ye still couldn’t open his eyes. The light simply surpassed the light of the sun, and it was impossible to look at.

Everyone here was shocked!

If someone could open their eyes at this moment, they would notice that the entire sky above the city was covered in beams of golden light, and they were like threads which crisscrossed and sliced through the sky!

Everywhere they passed, space was sliced open, causing the space above the city to seem like an enormous net. As for the formation around the city, it had vanished without a trace!

Around ten breaths of time later, the sky gradually returned to normal.

Everyone opened their eyes simultaneously and gazed at Blind Maiden. Her eyes were closed tight, and there were two streams of bloody tears running down her eyes.

Meanwhile, Blood Maiden appeared before her and grabbed her arm. After that, Blood Maiden brought her to Yang Ye and said, “Let her rest in there!”

Yang Ye nodded and transported Blind Maiden into the Primordial Pagoda.

Meanwhile, Nangong Tian suddenly said, “I’m truly surprised. I didn’t expect someone so outstanding to be amongst you. The formation of my city was actually destroyed by a single person. I’m truly surprised!”

Yang Ye glanced at Nangong Tian, and then he gazed at Blood Maiden, “Second Sister, take them and leave!”

Blood Maiden turned to look at Yang Lianshuang and Nether Maiden, “Both of you take them and leave. Hide and don’t show yourselves!”

Nether Maiden was about to say something when Yang Lianshuang nodded, “I understand!”

As she spoke, she gazed at An Nanjing and the others, “Come with me!”

As soon as she finished speaking, she transformed into a ray of black light that shot into the sky.

Nether Maiden and the others were quite hesitant.

Meanwhile, Blood Maiden suddenly said, “Hurry up if you don’t want to die!”

Nether Maiden and the others finally started moving when they heard her, and all of them shot up into the sky.

Lu Gu was about to attack when he witnessed this, but Nangong Tian stopped him.

Lu Gu gazed at Nangong Tian with bewilderment, and the latter spoke indifferently, “It’s fine as long as Yang Ye doesn’t leave. Their departure is a good thing for us!”

Lu Gu was stunned, and then he nodded.

It didn’t take long for only three people to remain here. Yang Ye, Blood Maiden, and An Nanjing.

Yang Ye gazed at An Nanjing, and the latter gazed at him as well.

Yang Ye fell silent for a moment, and then he said, “Head inside!”

She didn’t refuse and entered the Primordial Pagoda.

Once An Nanjing entered the Primordial Pagoda, Yang Ye gazed at Blood Maiden, “Second Sister, you leave too!”

Blood Maiden replied, “You’ll die!”

Yang Ye shook his head, “Trust me!”

She gazed at him for a long time before she said, “I’ll trust you.”

She paused for a moment and continued, “I promise to avenge you if you die.”

As soon as she finished speaking, she vanished into the sky.

Only Yang Ye remained here.

Meanwhile, Nangong Tian suddenly said, “Yang Ye, come! Let me see how you’ll fight 50 on your own!

Yang Ye gazed at Nangong Tian, “Forget it, can I surrender?”

All of the experts here felt speechless.
