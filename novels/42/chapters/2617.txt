Chapter 2618 – Lost!

Bam!

Yang Ye fell to the bridge with the pike still in his chest!

Even though he possessed the Slaughter Domain now, and his slaughter intent was at the peak of the Destiny Realm, it was still far from enough before the peak existences of this world!

After all, some of them were people from the same era as Qi Bitian!

Yang Ye stood up slowly from the ground. He grabbed the pike with both hands and tried to pull it out, but he couldn’t no matter how hard he tried!

It was like the pike was growing out of his body!

Along with the descent of the pike, Yang Ye’s Slaughter Domain had been instantly destroyed as well, so the people in the surroundings returned to normal!

However, some were already dead!Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Once they recovered, they immediately fled the area!

Meanwhile, a middle aged man in a black robe appeared above the bridge!

The middle aged man walked slowly in Yang Ye’s direction!

He was the master of the Divine Abode!

And one of the peak experts of this universe!

The Divine Abode’s Master glanced at Yang Ye’s blood red figure and said, “Looks like she isn’t going to show herself again! Of course, it doesn’t matter even if she does!”

They hadn’t been prepared the first time, but they were prepared for the worst now!

Moreover, it wasn’t just the Origin World alone that would face her, the Eternal Kingdom had joined forces with them!

The Divine Abode’s Master glanced at the surroundings and looked down at Yang Ye, “Even though it can be considered as bullying you, it can’t be helped. No matter what, all of this can end now.”

He was about to kill Yang Ye once he finished speaking.

However, a middle aged man suddenly appeared by Yang Ye’s side.

The Divine Abode’s Master frowned at the sight of him!

It was none other than the Desolate Emperor!

The Divine Abode’s Master spoke solemnly, “Desolate Emperor, you should think this through!”

“Haha!” The Desolate Emperor smiled and glanced at the surroundings, “The Soul Sect’s Master, the Eternal Lord, and those old geezers of this place. Oh, I didn’t expect that even Mr. Jing would be here. Tsk, tsk. Amazing. The most renowned and strongest experts of this world are almost all here.”

He gazed at Yang Ye and continued, “Young Brother Yang, you’re truly quite amazing!”

Yang Ye didn’t offer any response and just madly pulled at the pike. However, he couldn’t pull it out no matter what!

The Divine Abode’s Master spoke indifferently, “It’s not him!”

The Desolate Emperor smiled, “Of course. But I have to say that while he isn’t that great now, it doesn’t mean he won’t be in the future!”

The Divine Abode’s Master replied indifferently, “He may not have a future! Of course, if you interfere, then perhaps he may have a future. However, you should think about the consequences!”

The Desolate Emperor nodded, “I understand. If I help him, Eternal Kingdom would be the happiest! Because the Origin World would take their side, right?”

The Divine Abode’s Master remained silent!

The Desolate Emperor smiled and gazed at Yang Ye, and then he pressed his right hand lightly down upon Yang Ye. A moment later, the slaughter intent Yang Ye emanated was completely suppressed!

Yang Ye returned to normal!

However, his eyes were blood red!

His slaughter intent had been suppressed, but his desire to kill remained!

Moreover, the slaughter intent with him was surging!

The Desolate Emperor sized up Yang Ye and said, “Long time no see!”

Yang Ye remained silent!

The Desolate Emperor smiled, “Let’s be frank! I cherish geniuses. So, promise me one thing, and I’ll take you with me! Don’t worry, if I say it, then I’ll definitely do it!”

Numerous auras suddenly locked onto the Desolate Emperor!

The Desolate Emperor glanced at the surroundings and chuckled, “Calm down. Our deal hasn’t even begun. It’s not too late to act once he agrees!”

The Divine Abode’s Master spoke solemnly, “Desolate Emperor, I know you possess extraordinary natural talent, and you’ve been to that place and even fought that existence. However, are you really that confident in yourself? Do you really think you can fight all of us?”

The Desolate Emperor chuckled, “Let’s ignore that for now.”

He gazed at Yang Ye and spoke via voice transmission, “You just have to agree to give up the Sprite Progenitor and return to the desolate race with me, and I can help you with the pressure you face from the Eternal Kingdom. Don’t worry, the Sprite Progenitor will remain with the Origin World, and they probably won’t harm her.”

“They won’t harm her?” Yang Ye laughed ferociously, “Desolate Emperor, are you joking? They won’t harm her? No, they’ve already harmed her!”

The Desolate Emperor said, “Yang Ye, I can fight the Eternal Kingdom for you because I think highly of your natural talent, and so I’m willing to take this risk. But if you don’t give up the Sprite Progenitor, my desolate race will have to face the Origin World and Eternal Kingdom. While I don’t fear them, the situation in this world is quite complicated, and I don’t want to get myself dragged into it. If you agree to give up the Sprite Progenitor, the powers of this world won’t make an enemy of me just because I’ve taken you away. I don’t want to get dragged into this vortex, and they don’t want to get dragged into the vortex between me and the Eternal Kingdom as well. Understand?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “Sorry, I cannot abandon her!”

The Desolate Emperor frowned slightly, “If you give her up, you’ll survive; if you refuse, you’ll die. As for her, the future she faces won’t be any better!”

Yang Ye shook his head, “Then we’ll die together.”

Die together!

Yang Ye refused to abandon Snowy, Erya, or An Nanjing! If he couldn’t save them, he would die with them!

Was he being stubborn?

No!

Yang Ye knew his heart very well, and he knew the current situation well too. Yes, he could give himself a great excuse to abandon them, like staying alive is the only way that there would be a chance or hope!

However, it was all just an excuse!

If he left now, what about them? What kind of despair would they fall into? Snowy trusted him completely, and so did Erya and An Nanjing. He was their everything!

Erya had no family left, Snowy had always treated him as her closest family, and An Nanjing had no family left as well. She could even abandon the Martial Dao for him!

So, how could he abandon them at a time like this?

Since they couldn’t live together, they could die together!

That was all he could do!

He’d done his best!

If they really couldn’t leave together, they could die together! He planned to do his best, even if it ended in his death! But he would absolutely not give up!

Because if he chose to give up, there would be no need to come here!

The Desolate Emperor gazed at Yang Ye for a long time, and then he suddenly started laughing.

He shook his head slightly and patted Yang Ye lightly on the shoulder, “I’ve seen countless geniuses throughout my lifetime, and my race has many of them. To be honest, natural talent and all of that is really not that important at most times. Many people have good talent, but they aren’t good people. You’re one who follows his heart, and you’re still able to follow it when faced with death. You do not lie to yourself or make excuses for yourself. Very good, very good indeed.”

He glanced at the surroundings and said, “Allow me to be honest, aren’t you ashamed for bullying a junior with such great numbers. Even I feel embarrassed for you.”

The Desolate Emperor vanished on the spot.

Once he vanished, Yang Ye gazed at the Divine Abode’s Master, “Can you let me see them?”

The Divine Abode’s Master fell silent for a moment, and then he waved his right hand. Erya, An Nanjing, and Snowy appeared here.

However, they were being restrained by a mysterious force!

Snowy immediately started crying upon seeing Yang Ye!

The cut on her forehead was still there, and it was still bleeding.

Yang Ye felt unprecedented pain as he gazed at Snowy, and it was pain he’d only experienced when his mother passed away!

Yang Ye forced out a smile and said, “Erya, Jing’er, and Snowy, I’ve disappointed you all this time.”

An Nanjing shook her head slightly. She knew that Yang Ye had tried his best!

Erya glanced coldly at the surroundings, “Big Brother Yang, it’s alright. It’s just death! I’m not afraid of that! All of you listen up! How dare you treat Snowy like this?! If I survive this, I’ll tear all of you apart! I swear it!”

Erya was practically howling!

She was experiencing unprecedented rage!

Erya even felt like destroying this world when she saw Snowy had been treated like that!

Snowy had stopped crying. She felt no fear when she gazed at Yang Ye!

She was really unafraid!

Because Yang Ye was here!

Yang Ye cracked a smile, “Don’t be afraid. No matter what happens, I’ll be right there with you!”

Meanwhile, the Divine Abode’s Master glanced at the sky and sent out his divine sense. It didn’t take long for it to cover the entire Origin World!

However, he still couldn’t find the person he was looking for!

A short while later, he withdrew his divine sense and gazed at Yang Ye, “Looks like she won’t be coming. Since she isn’t, you can really die now.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he twisted his right hand slightly. In an instant, the spear in Yang Ye’s chest started to spin!

Yang Ye’s face instantly warped!

Suddenly, a voice resounded, “I heard you’re looking for me!”

The Divine Abode’s Master’s eyes narrowed slightly as he looked over, and a young girl was seated by the bridge to his right!

It was that same young girl!

However, her right arm was gone!

Qi Bitian!

The young girl was Qi Bitian!

She gazed at Yang Ye and cracked a smile, “I fought someone and lost, and I lost an arm in the process…”
