Chapter 620 – 10 Are All I Need!

“Everyone within Ancient Domain City shall die today!” Luo Tian’s voice resounded like a thunderclap.

The countenances of everyone within Ancient Domain City had turned ghastly pale. After all, even self detonation was useless before a ninth rank Monarch Realm expert.

Ding Shaoyao and the other girls had ghastly pale countenances as well. Once the Hallowed Grounds and Exalted Han Empire decided to stop abiding by the rules and risk everything, then the southern territory would face such a situation. It would have no chance of winning. Because the amount of Monarch Realm experts which the Hallowed Grounds, four divine beast clans, and the Exalted Hand Empire possessed far surpassed the southern territory!

Xiao Tianji and the others revealed extremely heavy expressions as well. They had no advantage in terms of the amount of Monarch Realm experts on their side, and they didn’t even have an advantage when it came to quality. Because just Luo Tian alone was sufficient to be extremely troublesome for them to deal with, let alone the other fifth rank Monarch Realm experts!

However, none of them fled or surrendered. They weren’t being stupid, but it was because it was meaningless. Because anyone who fled or surrendered at a time like this would just be inviting insult and ridicule!

Luo Tian’s expression was unsightly to the extreme, and his killing intent was seemingly material. Because this plan to eradicate the Undertaker had caused the Exalted Han Empire to lose 4 ninth rank Monarch Realm experts and 25 other Monarch Realm experts. Such losses were simply a heavy blow to the Exalted Han Empire!

Fortunately, the Exalted Han Empire was cooperating with the Hallowed Grounds, so the demon race and devil race wouldn’t dare launch a full scale invasion against the human race. Otherwise, the Exalted Han Empire might really face annihilation!

So, Luo Tian’s expression instantly became savage when he thought up to this point, and then he flashed over to the sky above Ancient Domain City.

“Die!” Luo Tian’s voice resounded in the sky as an enormous palm tore through space, and it carried a terrifying might as it flashed down towards the city from the sky above.

The enormous palm had just appeared when the space above the city had warped, and the enormous walls and countless buildings throughout the city had transformed into powder beneath the might the palm carried. Moreover, profounders below the Spirit Realm instantly slumped weakly to the ground while their bodies couldn’t stop shivering.

It was like the end of the world had arrived!

That was how terrifying a ninth rank Monarch Realm expert was!

Everyone within Ancient Domain City was terrified and trembled as they witnessed such a terrifying scene. Because not to mention resisting, they didn’t even have a chance to flee before Luo Tian’s attack!

“Attack!” Xiao Tianji’s voice resounded, and then the Monarch Realm experts in the sky above the city executed their strongest attacks.

The profound energy within Xiao Tianji surged, and it surged like a torrent into a black tortoise shell that he held in his palm. After that, the tortoise shell shot up like a bolt of lightning and expanded in midair. In just an instant, it was over 3km long, and it smashed heavily against the enormous palm....

Roar!

The white dragon roared furiously as he utilized the most direct method of attack. He slammed his body against the enormous palm....

The World Portrait transformed into an enormous scroll, and it flashed explosively like a bolt of lightning towards the enormous palm. Moreover, countless rays of light erupted from it as it flashed upward, and those rays of light struck the enormous palm.

“Ultimate Death!” The black clothed woman suddenly roared with fury, and then numerous images surged out explosively from within her. The images shot out successively, and they formed a complete link from the ground until the sky....

Those images were practically material figures because her speed was swift to the limit....

Bang!

Bang!

Xian Tianji and the others’ attacks caused countless explosions to rumble, and it was like thunderclaps resounding through the sky. It shook the space there to the point of rippling violently, and it seemed like the space there would shatter at any moment.

Luo Tian’s attack trembled violently after it suffered the joint attacks of Xiao Tianji and the others, and then everyone watched as countless cracks appeared on it. The cracks gradually spread throughout the palm, and it wasn’t long before an explosion resounded. The enormous palm exploded apart in midair, and it transformed into specks of energy that rained down throughout the surroundings.

Everyone within Ancient Domain City heaved sighs of relief when they witnessed this. After all, if that enormous palm had struck the city, then the entire city and its surroundings would be instantly transformed into powder!

Even though Xiao Tianji and the others had destroyed Luo Tian’s attack, Yang Ye’s face still had a heavy expression on it.

Because Elder Mu was being confined by Luo Dao, and Xiao Tianji and the others were probably unable to resist Luo Tian’s strength which was at the ninth rank of the Monarch Realm. So, once Xiao Tianji and the others lost or were locked in combat, then the other Monarch Realm experts of the Exalted Han Empire would be able to slaughter everyone within the city.

At that time, it would be meaningless to Yang Ye even if Elder Mu slaughtered Luo Tian and all these fellows.

Yang Ye had no other choice. At this moment, he had no choice but to reveal all his trump cards. Regardless of whether he could truly pose a threat to these Monarch Realm experts, he had no choice but to act. Because he might even lose the chance to do so if he didn’t act right now.

Yang Ye flipped his left palm, and the Sword Seed appeared in his grasp before his profound energy surged into it to activate it. After that, countless strands of various different Sword Intent erupted from within the Sword Seed and surged into Yang Ye’s body. As these strands of Sword Intent surged violently into him, his own Sword Intent was rising violently as well, and it wasn’t long before his Sword Intent rose to the 1st level of the Heaven Realm.

11th level Sword Intent swept out and caused the space around Yang Ye to tremble violently!

Everyone in the surroundings shot their gazes over to Yang Ye.

All of them were quite stunned when they saw Yang Ye’s 11th level Sword Intent. But even though they were shocked by the explosive rise in Yang Ye’s Sword Intent, they still shook their heads. Because not to mention 11th level Sword Intent, even 12th level Sword Intent would be useless before a ninth rank Monarch Realm expert.

The gap between them was truly too huge!

Luo Tian was about to launch another attack from midair when his gaze suddenly descended onto Yang Ye, and then he was slightly stunned because it had been countless years since Heaven Realm Sword Intent had appeared on Profounder Continent! So, he was slightly surprised by the 11th level Sword Intent that Yang Ye revealed, but he quickly shook his head and said, “Heaven Realm Sword Intent? You’re still just an ant!”

However, he’d just finished speaking when Yang Ye’s voice suddenly resounded, “Intent Ignition!”

As soon as he finished speaking, everyone watched as the Sword Intent around Yang Ye suddenly surged back into him, and then faint fiery red light suffused his entire body. After that, Yang Ye’s realm of cultivation started rising explosively....

The seventh rank of the Exalt Realm!

The eighth rank of the Exalt Realm!

The ninth rank of the Exalt Realm!

It was still rising because Yang Ye was still burning his Sword Intent.... 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Suddenly....

Bang!

The first rank of the Monarch Realm!

However, Yang Ye’s Sword Intent had fallen to the 8th level....

All those who witnessed this scene were stunned. The Monarch Realm? Yang Ye has attained the Monarch Realm? Can he still remain invincible amongst those in the same realm of cultivation?Luo Tian’s eyelids twitched because even he hadn’t imagined that Yang Ye would actually attain the Monarch Realm. What secret technique did that fellow utilize? He was actually able to rely on it to attain the Monarch Realm?

“Draconification!” Yang Ye’s voice resounded once more, and then everyone watched with astonishment as his clothes instantly transformed into ash before dragon horns, dragon scales, dragon claws....

Yang Ye is from the dragon race?

All the spectators were shocked once more.

“Such intoxicating power!” Yang Ye took a deep breath, and then he gazed at Luo Tian and roared with laughter, “Luo Tian, 10 strikes are all I need to kill you!”

As soon as he finished speaking, the ancient sheath appeared in Yang Ye’s left hand while a Dao Artifact appeared in his right hand. Yang Ye sheathed it within the ancient sheath before swiftly drawing it....

As soon as he finished drawing the sword, another sword appeared in his right hand, and then he sheathed it and drew it swiftly again....

Sheath!

Draw!

Sheath!

Draw!
