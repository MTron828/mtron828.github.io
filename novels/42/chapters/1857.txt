Chapter 1858 – Holy Sword, Please Return!

The old man hadn’t even finished speaking when a speck of cold light shot through his forehead.

Hiss!

Blood prayed out like a fountain while the cold light vanished from the hall.

Everyone here was stunned.

They hadn’t expected Yang Ye to return, so they hadn’t been on guard at all.

In next to no time, all of them recovered from their shock, and one of them quickly said, “Notify the Grand Leader!”

Suddenly, the expressions of everyone in the hall changed, and they flashed outside. A strand of destructive energy shot down from the sky above the city. It was extremely oppressive to them, and it made them feel like the sky was about to collapse!

If that attack were to be allowed to descend, then Night Assassin City would be obliterated!

“Stop it!” Suddenly, a voice resounded, and then countless experts shot up into the sky while numerous powerful auras swept towards the attack. Their joint forces obliterated that attack around 1km away from the city.

Too bad. Yang Ye thought to himself as he watched from above, and then he turned around and left.

He’d finished taking them by surprise and killing, so now it was time to leave!

However, a voice suddenly resounded in the sky above the city, “You’re going to leave after killing? You should stay!”

Yang Ye’s expression changed when he heard the voice, but it didn’t take long for ferocity to cover his face.

The Night Emperor!

It was the Night Emperor’s voice!

As soon as the Night Emperor’s voice resounded, a wave of powerful energy instantly enveloped the area around Yang Ye. Suddenly, a ray of light flashed, and then the Night Emperor’s energy was sliced into bits.

An instant later, Yang Ye appeared very far away, but a middle aged man had appeared there.

It was the Night Emperor.

The Night Emperor sized up Yang Ye and said, “I’m truly surprised. I didn’t expect you to grow to such an extent. You…”

Suddenly, Yang Ye vanished on the spot. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

He didn’t flee, and he’d appeared before the Night Emperor instead. After that, a speck of cold light stabbed towards the Night Emperor’s forehead. But it stopped abruptly around three inches away from the Night Emperor’s forehead because two fingers had clamped down on it!

Those two fingers belonged to the Night Emperor!

The Night Emperor gazed at Yang Ye and was about to speak, but Yang Ye suddenly twisted his sword with both hands.

Bang!

The Night Emperor was blasted 300m away. As soon as he stopped himself, Yang Ye’s sword had arrived before his forehead. However, a whirlwind suddenly appeared beneath his feet, and then the sword pierced through his forehead.

But it was just an afterimage!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye’s expression changed, and then he turned around and swung his sword!

Boom!

Yang Ye was pushed over 1km back.

The Night Emperor’s expression was gloomy. Yang Ye was completely different from when he’d first met Yang Ye that day. Both those attacks had been able to pose a threat to him.

What a terrifying speed of growth!

Suddenly, Yang Ye vanished on the spot.

The Grand Teleportation Technique!

His speed had always been extremely fast. Now, when he added the Grand Teleportation Technique to it, his attacks instantly arrived at his limits. When speed was at a certain level, strength would multiply!

The Night Emperor’s eyes narrowed slightly when Yang Ye vanished, and then he raised his right hand and clenched it, “Stop!”

As soon as he said that, a black vortex appeared on his fist. Yang Ye’s sword arrived just an instant later.

Bang!

The sword had just stabbed into the black vortex when space in a huge area shook violently. However, it didn’t crack apart and collapse. Because Yang Ye’s strength hadn’t leaked out, and all the energy within the wooden sword descended upon the black vortex.

However, the black vortex just trembled lightly, and the Night Emperor wasn’t shaken at all!

“Break!” Suddenly, the Night Emperor’s voice resounded, and then Yang Ye’s expression changed. Because a wave of powerful force surged out from the black vortex.

Bang!

Yang Ye was blasted 3km away.

Yang Ye glanced at the black vortex on the Night Emperor’s fist, and there was a solemn expression and a trace of curiosity in his eyes. It was a treasure, an extremely terrifying defensive treasure.

After all, the Grand Teleportation Technique combined with his current speed was something capable of instantly killing a Quasi Enlightened Realm expert if he could catch one off guard. However, his attack had been stopped by that treasure, and the Night Emperor wasn’t even shaken!

So, the Night Emperor was invincible while he had that treasure!

Suddenly, the Night Emperor said, “I’m truly surprised that you’ve grown to such an extent in this short amount of time. If you’re allowed to continue, I’m certain it won’t take long before I would be unable to do anything to you! Unfortunately, you won’t have a chance anymore!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he suddenly took a step forward, and then he pushed his hands forward. A pitch black spike instantly appeared before him, and the sky immediately darkened as if night had descended!

Yang Ye’s face became solemn when he saw the spike. It felt dangerous to him, extremely dangerous!

Suddenly, the spike started spinning rapidly before shooting forward like a bolt of lightning.

At this instant, Yang Ye noticed that the space in over 10km around him was actually becoming slightly ethereal.

Yang Ye was astounded. His profound energy surged madly. At the same time, a flame suddenly flashed out of his forehead and enveloped him in an instant. The wooden sword in his grasp was transformed into a flaming sword as well!

The Divine Yin Flame!

At this moment, Yang Ye didn’t dare hold back and had used the Divine Yin Flame!

An instant later, a strand of flaming sword energy flashed and collided directly against the black spike.

As soon as they collided, space instantly became ethereal. It hadn’t been obliterated, and it has turned ethereal instead. It was because their strength wasn’t just something space couldn’t endure, even a black hole couldn’t endure it.

However, it only took a moment for the space there to be slowly repaired by the Laws of the world.

At this moment, Yang Ye was 30km away. He’d been pushed there. However, the Night Emperor had been pushed over 10km away as well. As for his black spike, it was pitch black now. The Divine Yin Flame had caused that!

The Night Emperor’s face was horrifyingly gloomy as he gazed at the pitch black spike. That spike was a mid-grade Imperial Rank treasure, and it was one of his trump cards. He’d hoped to kill Yang Ye with a single attack.

However, he hadn’t expected Yang Ye to have that mysterious flame, and it instantly caused severe damage to the spike. Even though it wasn’t destroyed, it couldn’t be used for a few dozen years!

The Night Emperor put the spike away, and then a strange weapon appeared in his grasp. It was around 1m long and seemed like a sword. However, its tip was curved like a hook, and there was a thumb-sized black venomous snake floating around its tip.

A moment later, the Night Emperor stabbed it at Yang Ye from afar.

“Screech!” A sharp and ear piercing cry resounded, and then a ray of black light shot towards Yang Ye. Everywhere it passed, space was turned pitch black.

Yang Ye noticed countless thumb-sized black snakes within the black light. There were many of them, at least over 10,000!

Yang Ye didn’t dare act carelessly. He waved the wooden sword swiftly. In an instant, countless rays of flaming sword energy surged out, causing a rain of flaming sword energy to descend.

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!

Explosions resounded incessantly in the sky.

Suddenly, the Night Emperor vanished on the spot, and he was above Yang Ye when he appeared again. After that, he slammed the strange weapon at Yang Ye.

Yang Ye’s reaction was extremely quick. As soon as the Night Emperor swung the weapon at him, his wooden sword moved to intercept it. However, Yang Ye’s expression changed drastically when the wooden sword collided with it. Because his mind actually felt dazed and dizzy at that instant, and it was like someone had struck a heavy blow on his head.

After that, Yang Ye felt sharp pain come from his chest before his figure was blasted over 30km away!

His figure hadn’t even stopped when a black ray of light arrived before him.

Yang Ye quickly steadied his mind by force, and then he raised the wooden sword with both hands and swung it.

Bang!

The ray of light was blasted apart. However, at the exact same instant that he struck the ray of light, countless hair-thin black snakes suddenly shot towards him with their mouths wide open.

Bang!

Suddenly, a wave of flames surged out from Yang Ye, and the small snakes were incinerated before they could even get close to Yang Ye.

The Night Emperor frowned at the sight of this.

Yang Ye tightened his grip on the wooden sword. He was about to attack again when a speck of silver light shot over from the sky. An instant later, it appeared before Yang Ye. Yang Ye was shocked and quickly raised his sword to block it.

Bang!

The wooden sword shook violently, and then Yang Ye was blasted 30km away.

As soon as he stopped himself, a wisp of blood seeped out from the corner of his mouth.

Meanwhile, a man in silver armor appeared not too far away from Yang Ye.

It was that expert who had been sent down here by the Sovereign of Man!

The armored man gazed at Yang Ye, “Ant! You dare hold the holy sword?! Are you even worthy?”

As soon as he finished speaking, he gazed at the wooden sword, and then he withdrew a golden sheath and said, “I’m here on the Sovereign of Man’s orders. I’m here to summon the holy sword and take it home. Holy Sword, please return!”

The wooden sword in Yang Ye’s grasp immediately started trembling and seemed to be on the verge of struggling free from his grasp.
