Chapter 929 – One Must Have A Limit!

Sacrifice himself to protect those who weren’t related to him?

Yang Ye wasn’t so noble to do something like that.

Yang Ye was a selfish person, and he’d never hidden that fact. So, in his opinion, it wasn’t his problem even if the entire city was slaughtered.

Besides the promise he’d made the dean of the Ocean of Clouds Academy, there was another reason why he was defending the city, and it was Hao Shuaibo and the others.

If the city was breached, then unless a Saint acted against him, otherwise it would be impossible to stop him from leaving even if the wolf army had 2 million more reinforcements. But what about Hao Shuaibo and the others? Even if they could kill their way out of the army while under his lead, many would definitely die during that process! It was even possible for them to be completely annihilated!

After all, Hao Shuaibo and the others were still too weak. So, if Welkin Wolf Mountain Range dispatched another expert on Lan Xiao’s level, then Hao Shuaibo and the others would be instantly annihilated while he was locked in battle!

So, the best method was to defend the city!

They had the ability to fight against the wolf army by relying on the grand formation that surrounded the city. Once they lost the city walls, then not to mention him, Yang Ye, even 10 of him wouldn’t be able to turn the situation around.

The only way to defend the city was to converge the strength of all the cultivators throughout the city. However, Yang Ye was very well aware that the cultivators of the city wouldn’t come and help them. The current state of things proved his thoughts. So, he had to force them to help!

Just like before, those demon beasts had immediately turned around and intended to attack Yang Ye and the others upon entering the city. However, they started to feel fearful when Yang Ye immediately killed a few hundred demon wolves.

They naturally recognized Yang Ye. After all, he’d killed their commander.

Countless wolves had furious gazes in their eyes as they looked at Yang Ye, but not one dared to step forward. Of course, there were some that didn’t fear death in the beginning, and they charged at Yang Ye. But all of their heads flew into the air without exception.

“Aowu!” A howl suddenly resounded from amidst the wolves, and then the wolves immediately turned around and charged towards the city. It didn’t take long for them to vanish from everyone’s fields of vision.

In next to no time, shrill cries started to resound from afar!

Yang Ye withdrew his gaze, sat down cross-legged, and then started to recall his battle with Lan Xiao. The reason he’d been able to defeat Lan Xiao was the Laws of Speed and his Quasi Void Rank sword intent. Of course, if he utilized his Sword Domain and the Laws of Decay to launch a surprise attack, then he would have definitely been able to kill Lan Xiao without exerting such effort. But doing that might cause his possession of the Decay Laws to be exposed!

The Sword Domain and Laws of Speed were exposed, so he absolutely couldn’t allow his possession of Quasi Void Rank sword intent and the Laws of Decay to be exposed. Especially the Laws of Decay. After all, it could be considered as his greatest trump card.

If all a person’s trump cards were exposed before the eyes of all, then that person wouldn’t be far away from death!

Yang Ye was no fool. He knew that he’d risen too quickly in the Radiant Dimension, so there were definitely many who were investigating him. If it were powers that were on his side, like the Ancient Sword School or Ocean of Clouds Academy, then it wouldn’t be a problem. But what if it was his enemies? What if it was Sky Divine Hall or the Welkin Wolf Clan?

Concealing his strength to take his opponents by surprise was the best way to survive!

There was another reason why he’d fought Lan Xiao to the death. It was because he wanted to improve his strength through battle. Lan Xiao’s physical defenses and strength were stronger than his own, and Lan Xiao’s cultivation was superior to his as well. Besides that, Lan Xiao’s combat experience was superior to his own. So, the slightest mistake or carelessness during a life and death battle with Lan Xiao might end in his death.

Under such circumstances, it wasn’t just his cultivation that gained a huge increase, it was the same for every other aspect of his strength.

Besides the increase in his strength, he’d gained one more thing. He’d experienced the true strength of a truly strong high rank Half-Saint like Lan Xiao. Besides that, he realized that attaining a certain level in the cultivation of the body would allow one to fully disregard the strength of some Laws. For example, his Laws of Speed wasn’t really useful against Lan Xiao just now!

Lan Xiao’s strength was superior to You Wuying. Because even the Laws of Darkness wouldn’t be able to fully break through Lan Xiao’s defenses. However, You Wuying would definitely be heavily injured or killed upon suffering just a single strike from Lan Xiao!

I have to think of a way to improve my cultivation of the body! Yang Ye decided in his heart. He’d felt that his body was extremely strong in the past, and he felt that he didn’t have to improve it for now. After all, even a high rank Half-Saint couldn’t harm his body with easy. However, only after he met Lan Xiao did Yang Ye realize that while his body really was very strong when compared to ordinary humans and demon beasts, it was still quite inferior when compared to those truly formidable demon beasts!

Moreover, he couldn’t rely too much on his body. Because if he did, then he might be courting death if his opponent possessed some sort of destructive energy of the Laws like his Decay Laws!

Yang Ye opened his eyes, took a deep breath, and said, “I’m still quite weak!”

Yu Wushuang sat by Yang Ye’s side. She had her arms wrapped around her thighs while she slanted her head and gazed at Yang Ye, and she chuckled, “If those fellows in realms of cultivations above you yet were killed by you heard that, then their rage would probably bring them back to life!”

Yang Ye said, “Be prepared for danger in times of peace. Only by constantly maintaining a sense of danger can one live longer!”

Yu Wushuang suddenly said, “You’re not angry at me anymore?”

Yang Ye naturally knew what she meant, and he said, “There was nothing to get angry about. Because if I were to look at it from your perspective, then my actions are too cruel and cold. I know that it isn’t just you, many others amongst the outer court students had similar thoughts. I understand that because your experiences are unlike mine. When you have different life experiences, then the way you perceive things is naturally different. Once I realized that, I naturally realized that there was nothing to be angry about!” Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Yu Wushuang continued staring at Yang Ye with her head tilted to the side for a long time, and then she finally spoke, “You know.... The impression you give others is one that’s cold blooded, cruel, impulsive, vengeful, and extremely egoistic. Actually, it isn’t just an impression because you are such a person. You won’t hit me for saying that, right?”

Yang Ye stood up and gazed at the army in the distance, and a short while passed before he grinned, “Actually, every single person has a dark side in the depths of their hearts. However, many choose to suppress that dark side within them, and they disguise themselves as the so-called nice people of this world. Perhaps some would stay nice for their entire lives, but so long as there was sufficient temptation, then some would completely reveal their dark side. An honest person might normally be extremely honest, but if you suddenly gave that same person supreme authority, then perhaps that person would become a completely different person!”

Yu Wushuang remained silent. Because she realized that she was actually unable to refute him. After all, if a person constantly suppressed the dark side within the person’s heart, then perhaps that person could remain nice throughout his life if there wasn’t any temptation in that person’s life. However, it was just as Yang Ye said. If such a person were to suffer some sort of temptation, that person might instantly transform into a completely different person!

Desire and ambition!

Everyone had it. But once it was released, then any person might become a cold blooded and cruel person that might even be more terrifying than Yang Ye.

Yang Ye said, “Actually, it isn’t just a sense of morality that keeps a person from becoming evil, it’s their strength as well. After all, how could a person who didn’t possess sufficient strength dare to do something which exceeded the scope of his ability? Even if it was something that person was fond of and really wanted to accomplish, that person still wouldn’t dare do it. Because that person lacked the strength to!”

When he spoke up to this point, Yang Ye took a deep breath and continued, “The reason I’ve said all of that isn’t to tell you that everyone in the world is evil. I was only talking about most people. I, Yang Ye, don’t intend to be a nice person, nor do I want to be an evil person. I want to just be myself! You say that I’m cold blooded, cruel, impulsive, vengeful, and extremely egoistic. I admit all of that. I refuse to hide and deceive myself when facing my flaws and the darkness in my heart, and I would absolutely not disguise myself. I am myself, and I act as my heart desires.”

Yu Wushuang remained silent for a long time before she said, “You’re truly petty!”

Yang Ye chuckled and said, “I don’t think I’m a petty person. What’s a petty person like? They dare to fear anger yet dare not act, and all they know is how to scheme against others and stab them in the back. However, I dare to act if I’m furious. Right, if I really can’t defeat that person, like a Saint for example, then I naturally wouldn’t act against that person. Moreover, I would even run!”

Yu Wushuang was speechless.

She remained silent for a while, and then suddenly looked Yang Ye in the eyes, “Actually, you’re really charming. Because just as you’ve said, you dare to act if you’re angry, and you take responsibility for your actions. Many men aren’t capable of accomplishing that. Moreover, while you have quite a few flaws, the things you do are actually not unforgivable crimes. Conversely, if you look at it from another perspective, you’re actually a very loyal and faithful person. That’s obvious from how you fought the demon beasts, fought the inner court, and fought the secret court for all of us.”

“I never betray unless I’m betrayed. That’s the principle I live by.” Yang Ye continued, “I hope that it’ll become yours as well. A person can be capable of anything, but that person must have a limit to how low that person is willing to go. Understand?”

Yu Wushuang said, “I’ll remember what you said!”

Yang Ye nodded. He was just about to speak when the ground suddenly started trembling from afar. Yang Ye and the others looked over, and they saw a few tens of thousands of people rushing over in their direction.

Feng Wuchao and the others’ expressions changed when they witnessed this scene. Because every single member of that crowd had a ferocious and furious expression on their faces. Moreover, some of them had even emanated their auras, and they were pressing down towards them!

They were clearly hostile!

It didn’t take long for the group to arrive below the city walls.

Feng Wuchao and the others had vigilant expressions on their faces, and the profound energy within their bodies started to surge.

Meanwhile, the middle aged man who led the ground suddenly flashed up into the sky, and then he pointed a finger at Yang Ye and spoke fiercely, “You’re Ye Yang?”

Yang Ye nodded.

The middle aged man asked another question, “You let the demon beasts into the city?”

Yang Ye nodded again!

The middle aged man instantly revealed a savage expression, “Fuck you! Bastard! Kill him!”

“Kill!” Countless people charged towards Yang Ye and the others.
