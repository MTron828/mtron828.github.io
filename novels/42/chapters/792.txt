As soon as he finished speaking, a ray of light flashed.

At practically the exact same moment, the man swiftly swung his spear forward!

Bang!

Sparks sprayed from the tip of the man’s spear, and it shook slightly while the ray of light dispersed.

A wisp of disdain appeared on the corners of the black robed man’s mouth. Suddenly, his pupils constricted, and he immediately let go of his spear. After that, he watched as his spear transformed into dust.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye’s group had vanished on the spot.

A solemn expression appeared in the man’s eyes as he looked towards the distance, but there was even more excitement and happiness in his eyes, “The energy of the Laws! What a kid! As expected of the person who those dogs of the Hallowed Grounds fear and have a headache over! This game is finally getting interesting!”

As he spoke, he was about to chase after Yang Ye. However, Supreme Exalt He’s group and the blind old man arrived here.

“Your Hallowed Grounds actually mobilized so many forces just to kill a single Monarch Realm profounder. How laughable and sad!” The black robed man glanced at Supreme Exalt He’s group while his eyes were filled with ridicule and disdain.

“You aren’t laughable and sad? Why did you fail just now?” Supreme Exalt He spoke coldly. Even if it was a one on one battle, he still wouldn’t fear this fellow who stood before him. Not to mention that he had the numbers right now!

“I just want to have some fun!” replied the black robed man.

Supreme Exalt He laughed coldly and said, “Then I’ll wish you good luck. Please don’t play yourself to death!”

“If it wasn’t for the Saber Emperor, I would want to kill you right now!” The black robed man stared fixedly at Supreme Exalt He. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“You think too highly of yourself!” Supreme Exalt He said, “If it wasn’t for the Hallowed Lord, I would make you die a graveless death right now. I’ll allow you to understand that all of you aren’t anything great once you’ve lost your undying bodies!”

“Want to fight?” said the black robed man.

“Bring it on!” Supreme Exalt He pressed his hands together and was about to attack. Meanwhile, the blind old man’s figure flashed and vanished on the spot. Both Supreme Exalt He and the black robed man’s eyelids twitched when they witnessed this scene, and then they glanced coldly at each other yet didn’t attack in the end. Their figures flashed and vanished on the spot instead.

Yang Ye had the Stone of Suppression, and whichever side that obtained it would possess greater authority over the others when they cooperated. So, they naturally wouldn’t allow others to obtain it!

...

Yang Ye hid beneath the ground, and then hid within the Primordial Pagoda. At this moment, there were 4 supreme experts and 100 mid-grade Half-Saints outside. Once he was locked in battle with them, then only death would be awaiting him even if he was at the ninth rank of the Monarch Realm!

He hadn’t imagined that the Hallowed Grounds and defiant profounders would actually join forces to kill him!

Even though they hadn’t joined forces openly, he had no doubt that they’d come to some form of agreement. So, Profounder Continent was in danger!

“Are you alright?”

Within the Primordial Pagoda, Yang Ye frowned as he gazed at the Sword Spirit. At this moment, her figure was practically translucent, and it even made Yang Ye’s voice tremble slightly.

She shook her head slightly and said, “I’ll be fine after I absorb some of your sword intent. However, I won’t be able to help you anymore for some time!”

Yang Ye heaved a sigh of relief and said, “I’m sorry!” He actually felt quite guilty to her because she’d almost lost her life on more than one occasion because of him.

The Sword Spirit said, “I’m helping you for my own gain. You don’t have to apologize. What do you plan to do now? You should have realized that the Hallowed Grounds and defiant profounders seemed to have come to an agreement. If I’m not wrong, then they might attack Profounder Continent soon.”

Yang Ye took a deep breath and said, “It’s still far from a hopeless situation!”

“What? You have a backup plan?” asked the Sword Spirit.

Yang Ye nodded and said, “I’ve thought of a way. While it’s dangerous, I want to give it a try!”

The Sword Spirit said, “You have no choice but to try. I’m going to fall into a deep sleep. I’ll transform back into my original form. You just have to constantly nourish me with your sword intent. You can execute Heavenrend during this period. Your current strength should be sufficient to overlap at least 25 Heavenrends. Even a mid-grade Half-Saint might be instantly killed by that!”

As soon as she finished speaking, she transformed into the form of the ancient sheath, and it floated in front of Yang Ye.

Yang Ye took it in his hand, and then his sword intent gradually converged into it.

“Be careful!” said Ding Shaoyao.

Yang Ye nodded, and then he left the Primordial Pagoda.

Yang Ye didn’t return above ground, and he went deep into the ground instead. Around 4 hours later, a world of lava appeared in his field of vision, and he didn’t hesitate to transform into a ray of light that entered it.

In next to no time, a few dozen balls of flames that were at the Half-Saint Realm appeared in front of him.

“Take me to Xiao Ying!” said Yang Ye.

The flames they emanated blazed even more brightly, and they seemed to be issuing a warning to him.

“Take me to her!” Yang Ye’s voice was slightly heavy. At the same time, 12th level Sword Intent surged out like a torrent, and it pressured them to the point the flames they emanated dimmed down.

Suddenly, Xiao Ying appeared in front of Yang Ye. At the same time, a few hundred balls of fire appeared in the surroundings. All of them were Half-Saints, and there were even a few dozen mid-grade Half-Saints amongst them!

“Have you come here to give your life away?” Xiao Ying floated over to Yang Ye, and he instantly felt the temperature go up by a few hundred degrees!

Yang Ye withdrew his sword intent and formed a barrier around himself. As soon as he completed the barrier, the temperature around him instantly returned to normal.

A wisp of surprise flashed through Xiao Ying’s eyes when she witnessed this scene, and she said, “You’ve actually attained the 12th level of Sword Intent in this short period since we last saw each other, and your strength has even become so strong. What a surprise!”

“Where’s Lei Lin?” Yang Ye frowned. Because he hadn’t seen any sign of Lei Lin until now. Logically speaking, she would have definitely come here if she knew that he’d come.

“I devoured here!” Xiao Ying looked Yang Ye in the eyes as she spoke in an emotionless tone.

Yang Ye’s pupils suddenly constricted while the sword intent within him even became violent. At this moment, there was only rage and killing intent left in his mind! Boundless rage and killing intent! Especially when her image appeared in his mind....

“It was I that did it to her! It was I....” Yang Ye muttered softly as if he’d lost his soul, and then he suddenly looked at Xiao Yin, “I’ll bury all of you with her!” As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye took a step forward while he activated the Sword Domain.

Xiao Ying’s expression changed drastically when the Sword Domain appeared. Meanwhile, countless threads of sword intent shot out from within Yang Ye. At this instant, terror appeared in Xiao Yin’s eyes, “The energy of the Laws! You’ve actually comprehended the energy of the Laws! Quickly! Quickly stop! Lei Lin isn’t dead! I lied to you....”

The crimson red hue in Yang Ye’s eyes reduced greatly when he heard this. At the same time, his sword intent stopped spreading. However, it was still a little too late, and a few dozen balls of fire in the surroundings had been transformed into ashes!

A wisp of fear and shock flashed through Xiao Ying’s eyes as she gazed at the ashes. It wasn’t just her. The other balls of fire moved far away from Yang Ye and didn’t dare get close to him.

A short while passed before Yang Ye calmed down, and he stared fixedly at Xiao Ying as he said, “Bring her to me!”

Xiao Ying took a deep breath and said, “She’s in closed door cultivation. She’s charging into the Half-Saint Realm!” As she spoke, she pressed her hands together before pushing them apart, and then the lava was immediately split apart. There was a palace at the end of the path opened up between the lava, and countless tiny balls of lightning were circling in the sky above it.

Yang Ye instantly heaved a sigh of relief when he saw that, and then he gazed at Xiao Ying and said, “I’m sorry!”

Xiao Ying would naturally not be nice to him after he killed over a dozen Half-Saints of hers. She immediately said, “Since you know that she’s fine, then you can leave!”

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment, and then he said, “I came to ask for your help!”

“I refuse!” She replied coldly.

Yang Ye laughed bitterly and said, “I really didn’t do it on purpose. I was just truly unable to control myself when I heard that you devoured her!”

Xiao Ying suddenly said, “Are you that worried about her?”

Yang Ye replied, “I treat her as my own younger sister!”

Xiao Ying gazed at Yang Ye for a short while before he said, “What do you need!?”

Yang Ye answered, “You should be aware that I’m from Profounder Continent. Now, the Hallowed Grounds and the defiant profounders are about to attack Profounder Continent. Based on the current strength of Profounder Continent, it’ll definitely be destroyed by the end of the battle. So, I hope....”

“So you hope that I’ll help you fight them?” She interrupted him.

Yang Ye hurriedly nodded. He was about to speak when she suddenly stretched out her hand and pointed towards the side, “Leave right now before I change my mind!”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

She continued, “I really can’t figure out why you want to fight them, and you even want to drag me down with you. Are you sure there’s nothing wrong with you in the head?”

“....”

Xiao Ying continued, “Your current strength isn’t bad, but do you think that you can fight the Hallowed Grounds and defiant profounders? Profounder Continent wouldn’t even be a match for one of them. So, leave right now!”

Yang Ye said, “I’ve naturally prepared repayment for your help.”

“I won’t accept it no matter what it is!” She refused decisively.

Yang Ye sighed lightly and said, “Even something that can allow you to head into the Outer Heavens?” He was tricking her because while he did possess Primordial Violet Energy, even he wasn’t confident that he would be able to enter the Outer Heavens in the future.

“Enter the outer heavens?” Xiao Ying’s eyes narrowed, “Do you think I’m a 3 year old child?”

Suddenly, a ball of flames flew over to Xiao Ying, and then slight fluctuations swept out from it and entered Xiao Ying’s mind.

A short while passed before she raised her head and looked at him, “Do you know what has happened?”

Yang Ye frowned and asked, “What?”

She said, “The Hallowed Grounds and the defiant profounders have respectively dispatched 3,000 Half-Saints to the teleportation formation that leads to Profounder Continent. They intend to attack Profounder Continent!”
