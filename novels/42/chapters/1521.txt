Chapter 1522 - Fear!

Translator: InVader

Yang Ye had fled again!

Elder Hua had an extremely unsightly expression on his face. Just as the last time, he hadn’t expected Yang Ye to flee again. Because Yang Ye seemed determined to fight him to the death when they fought just now. However, Yang Ye had suddenly changed his mind and stopped fighting just a little while later!

Elder Hua’s face was extremely gloomy. At this moment, he understood Yang Ye’s plan.

It was to exhaust him!

Yang Ye was fighting a battle of attrition!

Yang Ye could recover swiftly, but they couldn’t. For example, he’d suffered some injuries during the intense battle with Yang Ye just now. Those injuries couldn’t be healed in an instant. It would take him at least three days to return to his peak. After all, Yang Ye’s Rebirth Sword had been enhanced by Returnal Rank sword intent!

Most importantly, he’d consumed a huge amount of his profound energy during the battle. At his level of cultivation, absorbing the spirit energy in the world and converting it into usable profound energy was a very slow process!

Moreover, Yang Ye didn’t just exhaust his profound energy during the battle, Yang Ye had even frequently taken the lives of Dualism Realm experts!

If this continued, then he would definitely be the only one who remained!

If Yang Ye continued to act so shamelessly, then even he might be exhausted to death!

At this moment, he understood that he had to get help!

Elder Hua gazed at the Dualism Realm experts from the War Pavilion and Emperor Sect, “Notify your sects.”

The Ma Clan had lost too many experts, so he didn’t dare to make more come here. Experts at the Dualism Realm were the main force of powers in the large world. If the Ma Clan were to lose a few more, then it would even shake the Ma Clan’s foundation. As for Rebirth Realm experts, he didn’t dare make another one come here at all. Regardless of whether it was the ma Clan, the Emperor Sect, or the War Pavilion, their Rebirth Realm experts were their foundation.

The loss of even a single Rebirth Realm expert wasn’t something that any power could bear.

Moreover, the Ma Clan wasn’t without its enemies. The Ma Clan only had three Rebirth Realm experts. If one more came here, it would represent that only one was left in the Ma Clan. If its enemies were to launch a sudden attack at that time, then it was very likely that the Ma Clan would be annihilated!

So, he’d placed his hopes on the War Pavilion and Emperor Sect. Because if they didn’t send anyone, then it might be impossible to kill Yang Ye!

The Dualism Realm experts from the War Pavilion and Emperor Sect nodded when they heard Elder Hua. At this moment, they’d realized how serious the situation was.

Meanwhile, Elder Hua added, “If you really want to kill him, then don’t bring more Dualism Realm experts because they’ll only be here to give their lives away.”

The Dualism Realm experts here revealed quite unsightly expressions on their faces when they heard Elder Hua. However, they couldn’t refute it because they really didn’t even have the strength to fight back against Yang Ye!

…

The lower dimensions.

After he fled back to the lower dimensions, Yang Ye tunneled his way underground again, and then he entered the 3rd level of the Primordial Pagoda. Just like before, he absorbed spirit energy and repaired his body!

Was fleeing embarrassing?

It definitely wasn’t!

What a joke! So many of them had ganged up on him, so he naturally had to flee when he should. Just as Elder Hua had realized, he was fighting a battle of attrition.

If he couldn’t succeed in a day, then he would try a second day. If he failed for two days in a row, then he would go on for two years until he succeeded!

He intended to try every day until he succeeded! 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Three days later, Yang Ye left the Primordial Pagoda and returned to the outside world. Three days in the Primordial Pagoda was merely a few hours in the outside world.

At this moment, he was at his prime again.

Yang Ye didn’t hesitate to shoot through Heaven’s Door once more.

The large world.

Elder Hua and the others had quite colorful expressions on their faces when they saw Yang Ye. They knew Yang Ye would be back, but they hadn’t expected him to be back so soon. How long had it been? Yet now, did Yang Ye look like he’d suffered any injuries?

Such swift recovery was heaven defying!

Yang Ye didn’t waste his breath at all. The Sword God’s Seal immediately lit up on his forehead, and then his sword intent rose to the Returnal Rank. A moment later, he transformed into a ray of light that shot towards them.

Besides Elder Hua, the other four moved backwards right away. They really didn’t dare to get close to Yang Ye.

This time, Yang Ye’s target wasn’t them, it was Elder Hua.

Yang Ye executed Heavenrend as soon as he charged at Elder Hua.

Even Elder Hua didn’t dare act carelessly against Yang Ye’s Heavenrend, and especially when it was enhanced by Returnal Rank sword intent. Because Returnal Rank sword intent could pose a threat to him. Of course, it was merely a threat, and it couldn’t kill him.

Elder Hua’s profound energy surged madly into his palm, and then a huge energy palm that was almost 300m wide appeared on his right. As soon as it took form, Elder Hua immediately slapped his right palm forward, and the energy palm swept forward at Yang Ye.

Everywhere it passed, space trembled violently. It was a shocking sight to behold!

Boom!

A loud explosion resounded. Yang Ye’s sword energy was blasted into bits while the energy palms trembled violently before collapsing. Meanwhile, another ray of light flashed!

The Rebirth Sword!

The expressions of the Dualism Realm experts here changed drastically when they saw the Rebirth Sword, and they moved backwards in unison. That attack was an absolute threat to them. Especially at close range. If it was executed in close range of them, then it could kill them in an instant! So, they had no choice but to retreat!

A trace of solemness had appeared in Elder Hua’s eyes as well. Because this attack was quite strong. However, it was just quite strong, and it couldn’t annihilate him in an instant even if it was a few more times strong. But it couldn’t be underestimated as well, nor did he dare to underestimate it.

Elder Hua’s hands shook, and then he slapped both his palms forward.

Bang!

The space in front of him shook violently while a wave of terrifying force swept forward towards Yang Ye’s attack.

Yang Ye’s Rebirth Sword and Elder Hua’s attack slammed against each other.

Boom!

They immediately exploded apart on contact. After that, a powerful wave of energy swept towards the surroundings. The wave of energy was extremely strong, and it pushed both Yang Ye and Elder Hua backwards repeatedly. However, Elder Hua had stopped after moving around 600m back. As for Yang Ye, he’d been pushed around 3km back, and it was even under the circumstances that he’d used the casket lid to defend himself!

At the moment Yang Ye stopped himself, his sword had vanished once more.

Elder Hua’s expression instantly changed at the instant Yang Ye’s sword vanished, and then he slapped his palms forward repeatedly!

Rumble!

Explosions rumbled like thunderclaps. It didn’t take long for everything to return to calm, and Elder Hua had been pushed around 1km back!

At this moment, Elder Hua had quite a few injuries on his body, and his countenance was slightly pale.

Obviously, even he had suffered some injuries after being struck by Yang Ye’s Heavenrend and Rebirth Sword. Of course, Yang Ye was in an even worse state. Even though he had the casket lid to protect himself, blood was still oozing out from the corner of his mouth, and it was because his internal organs had been cracked open!

Even though he seemed really powerful because he could fight a Rebirth Realm expert, he actually suffered quite a bit of injuries when he endured Elder Hua’s attacks. Elder Hua was too strong, and he was so strong that even the casket lid couldn’t fully block off the strength of his attacks. That portion which the casket lid failed to block would strike against Yang Ye’s body, and his body wasn’t really able to endure the impact.

If he didn’t have the casket lid, he wouldn’t have been able to resist a single attack from Elder Hua!

Elder Hua glanced at the injuries on his body, and then he gazed at Yang Ye. At this moment, he was quite regretful. He regretted allowing Ma Wudi to descend to the lower dimensions and offend Yang Ye that day. Yang Ye’s natural talent and strength were too terrifying, and even he felt quite fearful of it. When it came to a person like Yang Ye, one should either avoid offending such a person, or kill the person upon offending the person!

Otherwise, once Yang Ye was allowed to grow, he would become a disaster for the Ma Clan!

But Ma Wudi had offended such a madman like Yang Ye just for his own personal benefit. That was simply like pushing the Ma Clan into a dilemma. Take revenge? The outcome was that the Ma Clan lost many Dualism Realm experts, but Yang Ye was still alive, and he may even cause the deaths of more. Give up on taking revenge? The Ma Clan had its face slapped by Yang Ye. If it didn’t take revenge, how would it maintain its foothold in the large world?

Before this, he’d felt that they definitely had to take revenge. He wasn’t the only one, everyone in the Ma Clan was of the same mind. Ma Wudi could be allowed to die, but the Ma Clan couldn’t lose face. Yet now…

He remained silent for a long time, and then he looked at Yang Ye, “Yang Ye, I’ll leave right now, and we’ll let bygones be bygones between you and my Ma Clan. Alright?”

After hesitating for a while, he’d decided to give up on taking revenge. He didn’t have a good grasp of Yang Ye’s strength before this, so he felt that one Rebirth Realm expert and ten Dualism Realm experts would definitely be able to annihilate Yang Ye. Yet now… The facts proved that he was wrong. If he continued to go against Yang Ye, even if he could kill Yang Ye in the end, what would he get from it?

He would get nothing. Conversely, he may lose even more experts from the Ma Clan, and it might even end with Yang Ye crippling his Ma Clan!

He knew nothing about Yang Ye’s strength, natural talent, and potential before this, so at that time, the Ma Clan’s face was important. Yet now, once he found out about all of that, face wasn’t important anymore.

The expressions of those Dualism Realm experts changed when they heard Elder Hua. They hadn’t expected Elder Hua to suddenly seek reconciliation!

One of the Dualism Realm experts was about to speak, but Elder Hua waved his hand, “There’s no need to say anything. An outsider has no right to interfere in the business of my Ma Clan.”

He gazed at Yang Ye and continued, “So long as you agree, I’ll leave right now, and I guarantee that the Ma Clan won’t look for trouble with you again!”

Yang Ye hadn’t expected Elder Hua to suddenly do this. After all, they’d just been fighting with the intent to kill each other, yet now, Elder Hua actually refused to continue. Moreover, Elder Hua even wanted to make peace. This change in the situation was a little too quick. However, it was a good thing for Yang Ye. So, he immediately nodded, “Alright!”

He was very well aware that if he refused, then the old man would stop at nothing to kill him. Even though he didn’t fear that, it wasn’t necessary. He was of the same mind as Elder Hua! He felt that even if he destroyed the Ma Clan, it didn’t benefit him at all!

Elder Hua’s clenched fists instantly relaxed when he heard Yang Ye, and he even sighed with relief in his heart. Because it represented that the enmity between Yang Ye and the Ma Clan had come to an end.

Elder Hua took a deep and long glance at Yang Ye, and then his figure shook and vanished on the spot.

Once Elder Hua left, Yang Ye fell silent for a moment. Suddenly, he seemed to have thought of something, and he gazed at the Dualism Realm experts in the distance, “My god! All of you are actually still here!”

All of them were stunned speechless.
