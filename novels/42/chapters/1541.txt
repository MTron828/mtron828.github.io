Chapter 1542 - Right! Let’s Play!

Translator: InVader

Was Yang Ye strong?

Of course!

The demon beasts had watched him fight just now, but there were a thousand demon beasts here! The weakest amongst them was a Semi-Deity, and they were the type that hadn’t relied on any external forces to gain their current realms of cultivation. Not to mention Yang Ye in his current state, he couldn’t fight this group even if he could use his sword!

Yang Ye wanted to scare them, but it was obvious that he’d failed!

But it didn’t take long for them to give up on chasing Yang Ye.

Because Yang Ye was too swift!

There were a few who could catch up to Yang Ye, but the outcome was that they were beaten up!

Just like that, those who were fast and could catch up to him weren’t a match for him; as for those who were strong, they couldn’t catch up to him. So, it didn’t take long for them to give up chasing Yang Ye.

Obviously, they didn’t want to waste time.

Just like that, Yang Ye got an invulnerability talisman!

Yang Ye heaved a sigh of relief. If they refused to stop chasing after him, then he would truly be in trouble. After all, he couldn’t use his sword, so his strength was much weaker than what it should be. So, he could only flee before those demon beasts. Fortunately, the demon beasts didn’t want to waste time and gave up on him.

Meanwhile, Man Shi, Kuang Jing, and Hu Meng were quite stunned. You can do that? Just take it and run?

Actually, they knew that the reason those demon beasts had given up on chasing Yang Ye was Yang Ye’s strength. Those few demon beasts who caught up to Yang Ye hadn’t even been able to fight back against Yang Ye. Once they witnessed that, many of them realized that Yang Ye was difficult to deal with, so they chose to give up!

Yang Ye walked over to Man Shi and the others, “All of you leave first! I’ll be the last!”

Man Shi and Kuang Jing exchanged glances. They hadn’t expected that Yang Ye would make such a request. After all, it was risky. Because if some demon beasts attacked while Yang Ye was being teleported, it would be very dangerous. After all, the invulnerability talismans weren’t able to fully guarantee that Yang Ye would be able to leave. It had a limit, and the teleportation would be cancelled if the attack it suffered surpassed that limit.

Even if no extraordinary genius attacked, the joint forces of over a dozen demon beasts could still destroy the effects of the invulnerability talisman and stop the teleportation.

A short moment of silence ensued before Man Shi said, “I’ll do it!”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Why?”

Man Shi replied, “I invited all of you to join forces, so I’ll do it!”

Yang Ye smiled and said, “I’m sure you’ve noticed that those fellows know how strong I am. So, if I want to leave, they probably won’t come looking for trouble with me. After all, there are so many teleportation formations, so there’s absolutely no reason for them to look for trouble with me. Right?”

Man Shi and Kuang Jing fell silent for a while. In the end, Man Shi said, “Alright!” As he spoke, he glanced at Yang Ye and continued, “You’re a friend of mine now. If you need anything in the future, then just let me know. So long as it’s within my ability, I will absolutely not hesitate to help!”

Kuang Jing spoke as well, “Me too!”

Yang Ye smiled, “Then I won’t hold back! Haha!”

They exchanged glances and smiled. Even though Man Shi and the others were demon beasts, they hadn’t returned to their true forms yet, so Yang Ye treated them like humans. Actually, Yang Ye treated both humans and demon beasts equally. He chose his friends based on whether he liked them, and it didn’t matter which race they were from.

Many demon beasts were still fighting for the talismans.

It didn’t take long for all ten talismans to fall into the hands of someone.

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings. In the end, his gaze descended onto a blue robed man. There were two more young men behind the blue robed man.

All of them hadn’t returned to their true form!

The reason he looked at them was because he’d noticed that none of the other demon beasts here dared to look for trouble with that team of three.

Hu Meng spoke in a low voice, “They should be from the Dark Scorpion Clan!”

“The Dark Scorpion Clan?” Yang Ye asked, “Are they very strong?” RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Hu Meng nodded, “Extremely strong. Especially their poison. Their poison is extremely strong. Anyone poisoned by them will practically have no chance to survive. Besides a few specific clans, there aren’t any clans that dare to offend them.”

Yang Ye nodded slightly. He was about to withdraw his gaze when the blue robed man suddenly gazed at him. Yang Ye’s gaze met the blue robed man’s gaze, but it didn’t take long for them to withdraw their gazes. Even though they were opponents in the competition, they weren’t opponents yet in this round. They weren’t fools, so they wouldn’t waste their energy right now!

Yang Ye moved his gaze to the other side. There were two women not too far away from the blue robed man. If he judged them based on a human’s standards of beauty, they were really quite pretty. Of course, the most important aspect was their strength.

Yang Ye noticed that if the demon beasts in the surroundings attacked, they were practically instantly defeated by the two women!

“The Blue Bird Clan!” Hu Meng explained, “The Blue Bird Clan is extremely strong. Especially their speed. Their speed can be ranked in the top five of our demon race!”

The top five! Yang Ye nodded. It was extremely terrifying. After all, the demon race was just a general term of address, and there were many different clans of demon beasts within it. Since the Blue Bird Clan could be ranked in the top five, it was extremely terrifying.

Indeed, both of those women were very strong!

The reason Yang Ye was observing them was because he had to gain an understanding of them. After all, they may become his opponents in the next rounds!

A short while passed before Yang Ye gazed at Man Shi, “When are all of you going to go?”

Man Shi replied, “Once the ownership of the talismans are fully determined!”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Why?”

Man Shi replied, “Once the ownership of those talismans are confirmed, it’ll also be the moment that the others here are comparatively tired. At that time, it’ll be comparatively safer as well. Otherwise, if we try to leave right now, it’s very likely that we’ll be besieged if anyone here incites the others to attack us. Moreover, once the ownership of those talismans are determined, it’s also the moment when all the small teams will be trying to leave. At that time, the pressure we face will be much weaker because everyone will be trying to leave through the teleportation formations!”

“Alright!” Yang Ye nodded. If they left now, it was very likely that they would be besieged. But if they waited, then every team with a talisman would choose to leave. That would be the most chaotic period, and it was the best time for them to leave.

Time passed by slowly. It didn’t take long for the final talisman to be obtained by a huge demon beast. After that, all the teams with the invulnerability talismans started to charge towards the teleportation formations.

“Let’s go!” Man Shi immediately charged towards a teleportation formation.

Yang Ye, Hu Meng, and Kuang Jing immediately followed after him.

Because they were prepared, it didn’t take long for them to arrive before a talisman formation. Man Shi gazed at Hu Meng, “You leave first!”

Hu Meng hesitated for a moment, and then he nodded and entered the teleportation formation. He was the weakest, so he couldn’t stop the other demon beasts if he stayed behind. Thus, he had to leave first!

Once Hu Meng entered the teleportation formation, a group of demon beasts immediately charged in their direction. There were quite a few demon beasts in the group, and there were over 20 of them.

At this moment, all of them couldn’t be bothered to care about Yang Ye’s group’s strength.

It was their last chance!

Roar!

Man Shi suddenly roared with fury, and then he returned to his true form. After that, his figure shot towards the demon beasts.

Man Shi wasn’t the only one, Kuang Jing had returned to his true form and charged at those demon beasts.

Yang Ye’s group wasn’t the only group in battle. Battles were being carried out before other teleportation formations.

It was the final battle!

No one wanted to give up this opportunity!

Needless to say, Man Shi and Kuang Jing were really quite strong. Both of them held off over 20 demon beasts, and Yang Ye hadn’t even lent them a hand. He couldn’t. He had to stand on guard here and prevent other demon beasts from launching sudden attacks on Hu Meng.

It didn’t take long for ten breaths of time to pass, and Hu Meng vanished from the teleportation formation. Once Hu Meng vanished, the teleportation formation instantly dimmed down.

Only a single person could be teleported from each formation!

At this moment, Man Shi and Kuang Jing had stopped fighting while the demon beasts who’d besieged them had withdrawn as well. They’d rushed to a different teleportation formation.

Man Shi glanced at the surroundings. It didn’t take long for his gaze to descend onto a teleportation formation which was closest to them. At this moment, the fight there was very intense.

Man Shi slammed his front paws against the ground, and his huge figure shot off in that direction.

The demon beasts there hurriedly moved aside when they saw Man Shi’s figure slamming down towards them. Meanwhile, Man Shi gazed at Kuang Jing, “You go first!”

Kuang Jing hesitated for a moment, and then he nodded and entered the teleportation formation. Meanwhile, the demon beasts in the surroundings immediately charged over when they saw Kuang Jing enter the teleportation formation.

Man Shi charged forward at them.

Yang Ye still didn’t fight. Because just Man Shi was enough. They weren’t trying to defeat the demon beasts in the surroundings. Man Shi just had to keep them away for ten breaths of time, and Man Shi’s strength was completely sufficient to accomplish that. Just as before, Yang Ye remained on the spot to prevent any demon beasts from launching a surprise attack on Kuang Jing!

It didn’t take long for Kuang Jing to vanish within the teleportation formation.

Yang Ye and Man Shi immediately went over to the next teleportation formation. Man Shi gazed at Yang Ye, “I’ll be waiting for you outside!”

He entered the teleportation formation.

Meanwhile, over fifty demon beasts charged at them.

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly, and then he took a step forward and slammed his fist forward!

Bang!

One of the demon beasts that led the charge was instantly blasted away. After that, Yang Ye swung his fists swiftly, and every single punch blasted a demon beast away!

This time, Yang Ye hadn’t held back at all!

Every swing carried his full strength!

Because Yang Ye was too ferocious, it didn’t take long for some demon beasts to stop in their tracks. Because Yang Ye was too terrifying, and there was practically no demon beast that could withstand a single punch from him!

Ten breaths of time later, Man Shi vanished within the teleportation formation.

Yang Ye glanced at the demon beasts in the surroundings, and then his gaze descended onto a teleportation formation which wasn’t too far away from him. It was empty because the demon beasts around it were still fighting for it!

Yang Ye didn’t hesitate to walk towards it.

The expressions of the demon beasts there instantly changed when they noticed Yang Ye approaching.

They’d witnessed the strength Yang Ye revealed earlier, so it didn’t take long for Yang Ye to arrive before the teleportation formation. No demon beast had tried to stop him.

Yang Ye didn’t hesitate to enter it, and then he crushed the talisman!

Once the invulnerability talisman was crushed, a wave of golden light covered him. At the same time, the teleportation formation was activated.

No demon beast attacked.

It didn’t take long for five breaths of time to pass, then six breaths of time passed. When eight breaths of time had passed, five terrifying auras suddenly approached from afar, and then they slammed against the teleportation formation which Yang Ye was in.

Bang!

The teleportation formation shook violently. The teleportation was canceled and the golden light around Yang Ye vanished as well.

Meanwhile, a young man walked over from afar, “That fellow from the Goat Clan! I’ve been waiting for this moment for a long time!”

It was the young man in beast skin which Yang Ye had beaten earlier!

Yang Ye walked slowly out of the teleportation formation, and then he gazed at the young man, “You refuse to let me leave? Then let’s play. Right, let’s play!”
