Chapter 459 – Taken A Liking To Xiao Yuxi?

After the ‘battle’, the two of them sat facing each other within the room while a strange aura suffused it.

“Why?” asked Yang Ye. Qin Xiyue had acted very unusually today, and he didn’t believe that Qin Xiyue loved him to such an extent.

Qin Xiyue fell silent.

“Our relationship has already progressed to such a state. So, is there still anything that you can’t tell me?” said Yang Ye in a light voice.

Qin Xiyue glanced at him, remained silent for a moment, and then said, “You’re really an idiot!”

Yang Ye was speechless.

“My grandfather was only helping you in the beginning because you had the Darkbeast Empire’s backing, and it wasn’t just because of you. If it was only you, then he would definitely not go against the Flower Palace for you. But now, he feels that you have value, and you are worthy of him taking seriously and drawing you over to his side. So, you understand, right?” Qin Xiyue spoke flatly.

Yang Ye said, “You’re what he’s using to pull me over to his side?”

“You aren’t that dumb!” Qin Xiyue glanced at Yang Ye and said, “Even though you are cooperating with the Grand Qin Empire, it’s established on the basis that the Darkbeast Empire was backing you. After all, just you alone aren’t really useful to the Grand Qin Empire. However, because you’re too outstanding to the point even my grandfather was moved, he wants to make you a member of the empire. At the very least, he wants your relationship with the empire to be better than the Darkbeast Empire. In short, it’s very difficult to explain all the details within all of this to you.”

“You didn’t do it willingly, right?” asked Yang Ye in a light voice.

“Is that important?” A wisp of self-ridicule arose on the corners of Qin Xiyue’s mouth. She said, “I understood grandfather’s intentions as soon as he conferred a title to my mother and I. Our only value to the Imperial Household lies in my ability to draw you into the empire. Those born within the royal family are never able to take control of their own fate. Fortunately, you aren’t that detestable, so I won’t feel too wronged.”

Yang Ye walked over to her, grabbed her hands and said, “I didn’t resist earlier, so I know that I’ve already accepted you in my heart. On the other hand, since you were able to be frank with me, I know that I definitely have a place in your heart as well. Since it’s like that, then everything else isn’t important anymore. The important thing is that you’re my wife now, and I’m your husband. I guarantee that no one will be able to force you to do anything in the future!”

Qin Xiyue gazed at Yang Ye for over 10 breaths of time before she looked away and said, “Little Brother, you’ve even learned how to speak sweetly during our time apart. Even Big Sister was almost moved by you!”

Yang Ye shook his head and said, “Xiyue, I don’t like forcing others, nor do I like to force a woman to have feelings for me. If you really have no place for me in your heart, then I won’t force you.” When he spoke up to this point, Yang Ye flicked with his finger, and a spatial ring appeared in front of Qin Xiyue. He said, “There are some energy stones here, and they’re sufficient for you to cultivate to the Exalt Realm. Since you don’t like others taking control of your fate, then work hard to become stronger. Once you’re strong, then no one can take control of your fate anymore!”

Qin Xiyue fell silent.

Yang Ye sighed, and then he turned around and walked towards the door. Right when he was about to step through the door, Qin Xiyue suddenly appeared in front of him and revealed a spurious smile as she said, “Little Brother, you are really getting more and more capable. You are actually playing cat and mouse with Big Sister. Big Sister has no other choice but top use my beauty to trap you!” As soon as she finished speaking, Yang Ye was instantly pushed to the ground....

......

The sky was dark when Yang Ye left the Immortal Indulgence Pavilion, and a smile couldn’t help but arise on the corners of his mouth when he recalled the ‘service’ Qin Xiyue had given him earlier. Needless to say, she was really a little devil, a really cute little devil. If he hadn’t utilized the mutual cultivation technique he possessed, then he would have probably been too weak to get up after all of it.

Yang Ye couldn’t help but laugh bitterly when he recalled what Qin Xiyue had said before he left — I’ll make you wear a green hat if you don’t return alive.

She really made him fear suffering any mishaps. After all, he didn’t want to have a green hat placed on his head after his death!

In next to no time, Yang Ye arrived at the entrance to the Talisman Master’s Association. An explosion resounded as soon as he arrived here, and then a mushroom cloud suddenly arose from within the association while the entire ground trembled violently.

“Little She-devil! Who offended you this time!?” A furious howl resounded from within.

Bao’er? Yang Ye quickly thought of Bao’er. Right at this moment, two petite and delicate figures ran out from within the association building, and it was exactly Bao’er. Moreover, Little Yao was by her side. The two little girls seemed as if they’d done something wrong, and they were looking back as they run as if to see if someone was chasing them....

An old man appeared within Yang Ye’s field of vision. Yang Ye knew the old man, he was called Feng Xiu. At this moment, Feng Xiu’s clothes were tattered as if they’d been blasted by something.

Feng Xiu pointed a finger at Bao’er and roared furiously. “Little She-devil, what exactly do you want!? Didn’t I just complain about you by accident once? Is it really necessary to blast me with talismans every single day? Is it really necessary? I’m definitely going to teach you a lesson on your grandfather’s behalf today. Otherwise, I’ll definitely die at your hands one day!”

“Geezer, who asked you to poke your nose in our business when Little Yao and I blasted those bastards? Hmph! Grandpa Bai has agreed to craft super extraordinary talismans for me. I’m going to blast you to the Grand Myriad Mountains once I get them.” Bao’er held Little Yao’s hand as she run and shouted.

Feng Xiu was infuriated upon hearing this. At this moment, he was filled with regret. He regretted that he’d accidentally said that Bao’er was a troublemaker, and the little she-devil had heard him. His nightmare started on that day as he would be blasted by a talisman every few days, and it just so happened that those talismans weren’t capable of killing him yet could post a threat to him.

So, Feng Xiu was extremely angry!

I must give that little she-devil a small lesson this time! Feng Xiu flicked with his finger, and then a strand of gentle yet strong wind blew forward and instantly arrived behind Bao’er and Little Yao. Right when it was about to strike Bao’er and Little Yao, a strand of sword qi suddenly appeared and struck it, causing it to instantly disperse.

Yang Ye appeared before Bao’er and Little Yao, and then he bowed slightly to Feng Xiu and said, “Senior, why lower yourself to the same level as two little girls? Give junior some face and spare them this time, alright? I guarantee that this little she-devil won’t look for trouble with senior again!”

“Yang Ye!” Feng Xiu’s eyelids twitched as he sized Yang Ye up, and then he sighed and said, “Sure enough, every new generation excels beyond the previous. Even I wouldn’t dare say that I’m confident in defeating you with the strength you possess right now. Alas, such speed of cultivation really makes me feel like I’ve wasted my time cultivating. It really can’t be compared!”

Yang Ye smiled and remained silent.

Feng Xiu shook his head, and then his figure flashed and vanished on the spot. After Feng Xiu left, Little Yao instantly pounced into Yang Ye’s arms as she said, “Big Brother, why haven’t you come to see me for so long? Do you not like Little Yao anymore?”

Yang Ye was on the verge of tears as he rubbed Little Yao’s head and said, “Hasn’t Big Brother come to see you now? Eh, Little Yao, you’re at the seventh rank of the First Heaven Realm? Good work! You’re much more formidable than Big Brother was. Looks like it won’t be long before Little Yao has to protect Big Brother!”

She raised her head to gaze at Yang Ye and said, “Big Brother, I’ll definitely work hard on my cultivation in the future. Once I’m as formidable as Grandpa Lin Shan, then I’ll protect Big Brother. Right, I want to rescue mother as well. I want to protect both Big Brother and mother, and I’ll make all of them unable to bully our family again!”

Yang Ye was stunned when he heard this. She still doesn’t know that mother.... Yang Ye came to an understanding upon thinking about it a little. It was probably that his Master, Lin Shan, and the Talisman Master’s Association had concealed it from Little Yao, whereas, Xiao Yuxi had probably chosen to keep it from Little Yao as well. Yang Ye hesitated for a moment, forced out a smile, and then said, “Alright, Big Brother will wait for Little Yao to become strong, and then we’ll go rescue mother together and protect her, alright?”

“Alright!” Little Yao smiled sweetly.

Yang Ye rubbed her head, and then he gazed at Bao’er and said, “What? You don’t recognize me anymore?”

Bao’er blinked and said, “Little Laborer, I heard that you’ve very strong. Is that true?”

Yang Ye smiled “I’m just alright!”

“Then can you help me?”

“With what?” Yang Ye was curious.

“Help me pull off that old geezer’s beard. He actually dared to talk bad about me in front of grandfather and caused me to be grounded for 3 days. How infuriating! Unfortunately, I’ve finished all my talismans while those other old geezers won’t give me talismans easily. Otherwise, I’d definitely blast him all the way to the Grand Myriad Mountains!” Bao’er spoke angrily.

Yang Ye shook his head. She really is a little she-devil!

Yang Ye walked over to her, withdrew a few rare Heaven Rank spirit herbs, and then passed them to her before he said, “I can’t help you do that. However, I can give you these. You should be able to recognize them. Take them to those old geezers and they’ll definitely be willing to give you some extraordinary talismans in return. Get some and blast him with them, alright?”

Bao’er blinked, and then grabbed all those spirit herbs from Yang Ye before she exclaimed. “A Heaven Rank Bluesilver Grass, a Heaven Rank Jadecloud Herb, a Heaven Rank Bluesilver Fruit. Ah! I’ve only seen all of these in ancient books. I never expected them to really exist. Little Laborer, are you really giving them to me?”

“Of course!” Yang Ye hurriedly nodded and said, “I’m Bao’er’s first friend. Even though these things are precious, are they more precious that our friendship?”

Bao’er gave Yang Ye a thumbs up and said, “Alright! Little Laborer, I didn’t misjudge you. You really are a good friend. Right, let me get some talismans and blast that old geezer. We’ll play a little later!” As soon as she finished speaking, Bao’er didn’t even look back as she ran into the association building.

“Big Brother, those grandfathers will definitely hate you if they find out!” Little Yao spoke softly.

Yang Ye smiled and said, “Little Yao will definitely not expose my secret, right?”

Little Yao spoke firmly. “Of course!” Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Yang Ye smiled, and then he looked towards the side and said, “Yuxi, show yourself!”

Xiao Yuxi appeared before Yang Ye and Little Yao once he finished speaking, and then she nodded lightly to Little Yao before she gazed at Yang Ye. “I didn’t tell her!”

“I know!” Yang Ye nodded. He took hold of Little Yao’s hand and said, “Come and meet your sister-in-law!”

“Sister-in-law?” Little Yao was stunned. She glanced at Xiao Yuxi, and then glanced at Yang Ye.

Yang Ye nodded.

Xiao Yuxi took the initiative to walk over to Little Yao, and then she took Little Yao’s other hand before she flipped her own. A fine and curved silver saber appeared before Little Yao as Xiao Yuxi said, “This is for you!”

“A Heaven Rank treasure!” Little Yao exclaimed upon laying eyes on it, and then she gazed at Xiao Yuxi and spoke with uncertainty. “Is it really for me?”

Xiao Yuxi nodded.

Little Yao smiled sweetly, and then she took the silver curved saber that was thin like the wind of a cicada. After that, she seemed to have thought of something, and she raised her head to gaze at Xiao Yuxi. She hesitated for a moment before she said, “Thank you, sister-in-law!”

The corners of Xiao Yuxi’s mouth curled up a little upon hearing this, and it formed an enchanting smile.

“Eh, what a beautiful woman!” Right at this moment, a young man who was just about to walk towards the association building had stopped, and he exclaimed with admiration as he gazed at Xiao Yuxi.

There was an old man holding a black iron stick by the young man’s side as well.

Xiao Yuxi frowned a little yet paid no attention to the young man as she walked over to Yang Ye’s side with Little Yao. Yang Ye glanced at the young man, and then he took their hands and walked off towards the distance because he truly wasn’t interested in paying any attention to such a fellow.

The young man was slightly stunned, and then he revealed a playful smile as he said, “I never expected that I would actually encounter such an extraordinary woman upon coming her to participate in the exams to become a talisman master. Elder Hei, I want her!”

The old man who held the stick chuckled while a wisp of lust flashed through his eyes. “As you wish, Young Master. However, I hope that Young Master will allow me to have a taste as well once you’re finished.”

The young man smiled and said, “Of course!”

Meanwhile, Yang Ye’s footsteps had stopped.
