Chapter 1824 – Lifespan Fruit!

At this moment, the Nangong Clan was embarrassed!

Because Yang Ye hadn’t just destroyed the City Governor’s Estate, he was holding their patriarch’s head, and he was about to leave right before everyone’s eyes!

However, they couldn’t do anything about it!

Try to kill him?

They didn’t dare to do that.

Because they would have to pay a painful price to accomplish that. After all, there weren’t a few dozen True Realm experts here any longer. Now, there were only a little over a dozen of them. Moreover, Yang Ye wasn’t all by himself. There were those terrifying women supporting him as well!

Once they attacked him and those women showed themselves, then the Nangong Clan would vanish from the face of the world.

Since the Nangong Clan didn’t dare to attack him, the others hiding in the shadows didn’t dare to as well.

Most 6th stage True Realm experts were no match for Yang Ye at his current strength. As for the truly senior 6th stage True Realm experts, they wouldn’t rashly fight Yang Ye to the death. Because even if they won, they may be left seriously injured after the battle.

At that time, others would reap the rewards!

Moreover, everyone knew that Yang Ye wasn’t alone, and there was a group of monstrous geniuses standing behind him.

So, no one dared to act.

They just watched as Yang Ye walked out of the city.

Yang Ye stopped outside Divine Ruins City, and then he waved his hand. Nangong Tian’s head flew up and was hung above the city gates.

A moment later, Yang Ye turned to look towards the city and said, “If you want my sword and my life, feel free to come for it. I’m ready whenever you are!”

His figure vanished into the sky once he finished speaking.

The entire city fell deathly silent!

It didn’t take long for everything Yang Ye did in the Divine Ruins City to spread rapidly.

At this moment, everyone throughout Heaven Pillar Mountain knew Yang Ye’s name.

Previously, the experts throughout Heaven Pillar Mountain knew Yang Ye because he had the wooden sword which could pierce the barrier. But at that time, they knew very little about him, and they merely knew that he was a slightly strong genius.

Yet now, they realized that this genius wasn’t just slightly strong, he was absolutely strong.

Yang Ye didn’t know that the incident in Divine Ruins City made many experts give up on targeting him. They knew their strengths very well. Since even the governor of Divine Ruins City had been killed by Yang Ye, how could they survive?

The wooden sword was good, but their lives were better! Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

If they lost their lives, the sword would be meaningless to them!

However, there were some who weren’t willing to give up, and they were those who were confident in their strength.

After all, if they still dared to target Yang Ye after finding out about his true strength, then they were definitely extremely strong existences or huge fools.

Once he left Divine Ruins City, Yang Ye didn’t contact Yang Lianshuang and the others. He found a spot, sat down cross-legged, and entered the Primordial Pagoda.

The Primordial Pagoda!

Recover!

Since the battle began, he’d exhausted his strength too much. Especially his profound energy, it was practically completely depleted. His body was in an extremely exhausted state as well. At this moment, he had to rest well.

Around two hours later, Yang Ye’s body had recovered completely, and his profound energy was at its peak again.

He’d recovered completely again!

It was time to refine Sword Servants!

He naturally hadn’t wasted the corpses of all the 6th stage True Realm experts he’d killed earlier. Even though the Sword Servants he refined weren’t as strong as true 6th stage True Realm experts, they couldn’t be underestimated.

Refining Sword Servants wasn’t easy, and it took him an entire day to complete each one.

Three days later, Yang Ye had refined three new Sword Servants, so now he had a total of five.

He had a few more corpses, but he couldn’t refine any more. Because controlling five was his limit.

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment, and then he decided to send those five Sword Servants to Su Qingshi and the others. They weren’t very helpful to him because if he wanted to flee, then his current strength allowed him to escape from most 6th stage True Realm experts with ease.

Conversely, if someone could catch up to him, that person’s strength definitely surpassed him tremendously, so even ten Sword Servants wouldn’t make a difference.

Besides that, he would feel much more at ease if they were with Su Qingshi and the others. They weren’t just able to protect Su Qingshi and the others, they allowed him to be aware of the situation over there at all times. If Su Qingshi and the others were in danger, he could find out at any time! Moreover, those five Sword Servants could buy him some time to get there and save them!

Yang Ye didn’t hesitate a moment longer and sent them to Su Qingshi and the others. With the strength those Sword Servants possessed, it would take a day at most for them to get there.

After that, Yang Ye waved his left hand, and then Nangong Tian’s corpse appeared before him. He gestured with his left hand, and the ring on Nangong Tian’s finger flew into his grasp.

Yang Ye was stunned when he scanned through it with his divine sense.

It was because the space within the ring was enormous. It was over 10km wide, and Yang Ye found something in it.

A tree!

A huge tree that was over 300m tall, and there were numerous crystalline and translucent fruits on it.

Lifespan Fruits!

Yang Ye took a glance at them. There were almost 60 of them on the tree!

60 Lifespan Fruits!

Needless to say, Yang Ye was quite excited. These fruits weren’t very useful to him, but they were a form of lethal temptation to the old 6th stage True Realm experts who were about to reach the end of their lifespan!

So, while he had no use for them, he could use them to draw people over to his side or sell them for things that he needed.

Besides the tree, there were many other things in the ring. However, they couldn’t catch Yang Ye’s eye. His current equipment was extraordinarily godly, so ordinary treasures really couldn’t catch his attention!

Yang Ye moved the tree into the Primordial Pagoda, and then something shocking occurred. The tree started to tremble, and then it started to grow. Yang Ye watched with astonishment as the tree grew from its initial height of 300m to a height of over 1km!

It was an entire three times taller!

Besides that, the Lifespan Fruits on it had almost doubled in size. At the same time, the entire fruit was covered in small fruits. The fruits were very small, and they were only the size of a thumb.

Obviously, they were Lifespan Fruits!

At this moment, Yang Ye was quite stunned.

Meanwhile, Little Sky and Snowy suddenly appeared by his side.

“It’s because of the violet energy!” Little Sky spoke softly, “The violet energy here far surpasses the spirit energy out there. It isn’t just effective on humans and demon beasts, it’s effective on natural treasures as well. Or it should be said that it’s effective on all living beings!”

She gazed at the tree and continued, “The violet energy here can stimulate its potential and help it grow to its best potential, and the violet energy here is also very beneficial to the people, demon beasts, Snowy, you, me, and everyone else in here.”

Snowy hurriedly nodded while she stood on Little Sky’s shoulder, and then she waved her claw. Threads of violet energy were instantly caught within her claw, and then she opened her mouth and swallowed it.

A short while later, she patted her stomach lightly, and then she spat out a thumb-sized violet colored crystal.

Yang Ye and Little Sky were stunned when they saw the violet crystal.

Meanwhile, Snowy passed it to Yang Ye.

Yang Ye took it, and it didn’t take long for an extremely solemn expression to appear on his face. Because the energy within violet crystal was extremely pure, and it was at least three times purer than the Energy Pearls he’d used in the past!

In the past, he had to consume three or move Energy Pearls in order to fully recover his profound energy, and it would take at least an hour. Yet now, he just had to consume a single Violet Crystal, and he would be able to fully replenish his profound energy!

As for the time. Based on his estimations, it would take no more than 15 minutes!

What did that represent?

This represented that he didn’t have to worry about profound energy when he fought in the future. So long as he was in battle, he just had to consume a single Violet Crystal, and his profound energy would be replenished incessantly. So long as he had profound energy, he could use the violet energy within him to ceaselessly repair his body and execute all sorts of powerful sword techniques.

Yang Ye became excited when he thought up to this point!

He suppressed the excitement in his heart, and then he gazed at Snowy, “Snowy, how many of this can you make?”

Snowy blinked, and then she started waving her claws about.

The smile on Yang Ye’s face gradually vanished. Because it was much more difficult to create than those ordinary Energy Pearls. Simply speaking, it was quite difficult for her to create Violet Crystals. The reason she’d been able to create one so quickly just now was because she’d already swallowed a huge amount of violet energy before this, and she’d condensed it within her body.

Simply speaking, every single Violet Crystal she created took at least three days to make. Moreover, that was only during times that she wasn’t just playing all day and concentrated on creating a Violet Crystal. If she was enjoying herself, then it would probably take around two weeks to create one!

Two weeks!

It was naturally too slow!

Yang Ye took Snowy in his heart when he thought about that, and he smiled, “Snowy, can you make a little more of this for me? Just a little more?”

Snowy blinked, and then she nodded. Right when Yang Ye was feeling happy, Snowy suddenly raised her little claw and started waving it.

Conditions!

She had conditions!

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.
