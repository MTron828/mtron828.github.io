Chapter 2509 – Get Me Another Ball!

Shameless!

Xing Biqing and Ye Zhibei couldn’t help but want to laugh.

Needless to say, Yang Ye’s image in their hearts had completely collapsed because of this.

Before this, Yang Ye had been a serious, ruthless, and decisive person to them. But now they realized that he could even adapt! Yet, most importantly, they realized his skin was very thick!

Extremely thick!

Yang Ye’s face didn’t change at all because of what the ethereal figure had said. Shame? What was that? Could it feed him?

The ethereal figure suddenly asked, “What era is it now?”

Ye Zhibei and Xing Biqing exchanged glances. In the end, Xing Biqing answered, “Senior, are you from the ancient times?”

The ethereal figure replied, “Yes!”

Xing Biqing spoke solemnly, “That’s many eras ago!”

The ethereal figure spoke softly, “As expected!”

They didn’t say another word and just remained vigilant.

One should always be on guard against others!

Meanwhile, the ethereal figure gazed at Yang Ye, “You know Chen Xuanan!”

Chen Xuanan!

Yang Ye was surprised because this ethereal figure was actually from the same era as Chen Xuanan.

Luckily, he hadn’t chosen to continue fighting. Otherwise, he would have been beaten to death!

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts and nodded, “I do know him.”

The ethereal figure fell silent for a long time and asked, “How is he right now?”

Yang Ye replied, “He’s dead. Only a strand of his soul remains.”

The ethereal figure spoke softly, “I didn’t expect someone as strong as him to lose at the hands of that one. Looks like the heavens are impossible to defy!”

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and asked, “Senior, were you friends?”

The ethereal figure said, “Not really, but I really admired him. That’s why I’m willing to speak with you. Otherwise, all three of you would die here today.”

Yang Ye fell silent. Actually, he was quite curious about why the ethereal figure had been so nice and willing to speak. Now, he understood. The ethereal figure recognized Executor, or it should be said, the ethereal figure had noticed that there was a link between him and Chen Xuanan!

Yang Ye realized that Chen Xuanan had quite the reputation during his time!

Meanwhile, Xing Biqing suddenly asked, “Senior, what is this place?”

The ethereal figure replied, “A prison.”

All of them were shocked.

A prison!

Yang Ye asked, “Senior, what do you mean?”

The ethereal figure replied, “Tell me. If two kingdoms go to war, and one side loses. What would happen?”

Ye Zhibei replied solemnly, “Dead or imprisoned!”

The ethereal figure nodded slightly, “Many died all those years ago, and we are the group that was imprisoned!”

Xing Biqing hesitated for a moment and said, “Can you leave?”

The ethereal figure shook its head, “We’re imprisoned to death!”

Imprisoned to death!

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and said, “Maybe I can take you outside.”

Since the ethereal figure had displayed goodwill, he could as well. It was never a bad thing to make friends with someone strong!

The ethereal figure suddenly started laughing, “Hahaha!”

Yang Ye glanced at the ethereal figure and wondered if the latter had gone mad!

A short while passed before the ethereal figure said, “Kid, I know you have a pretty good treasure, and you want me to go inside of it and take me with you, right?”

Yang Ye didn’t lie and nodded.

The ethereal figure said, “If you do that, you will be obliterated. You won’t even leave a hair behind!”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Why?”

The ethereal figure replied, “Perhaps Chen Xuanan told you about some existences. Well, it’s fine if he didn’t. You just have to understand that you can’t touch some things as the consequence of it is death. At the very least, it’s like that for you right now!”

Yang Ye fell silent.

He knew that the ethereal figure was probably speaking about destiny.

Four Dimensional Space?

Yang Ye shook his head. He really didn’t understand the world of these extraordinary figures. Why did they have to fight destiny to the death? Why couldn’t they just talk about it? In any case, he’d decided that if he encountered that thing they called destiny, he would definitely speak peacefully with it. Fighting was too barbaric!

Meanwhile, the ethereal figure suddenly said, “Are you interested in heading down further?”

Further down!

Yang Ye glanced at the ethereal figure with a strange gaze, “Senior, are you trying to use something else to kill us?”

The ethereal figure said, “That armor is just half a Super Divine Treasure, but a real Super Divine Treasure is down there. Of course, it’s definitely damaged. Completely unharmed Super Divine Treasures should be very rare now! However, even if it’s damaged, it should be very helpful to all of you. So, are you interested in going down there?”

Xing Biqing asked, “Why?”

The ethereal figure replied, “I’ll be frank. There’s an animal below me, and I’ve been fighting it for countless years. It should be at the Lord Realm. So, if you join forces, it shouldn’t be too difficult to kill it.”

They exchanged glances. In the end, Yang Ye shook his head, “I have other business to attend to, so I won’t be doing that.”

He gazed at the others and asked, “What about you?”

Ye Zhibei was direct, “I refuse!”

Xing Biqing nodded slightly, “Me too.”

None of them were stupid!

The ethereal figure fell silent.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye and the others fell silent too. A short while later, the ethereal figure said, “I won’t force you. Go on.”

Go!

They didn’t hesitate to turn around and leave.

Not long after they left, the ethereal figure looked down. The area below was simply bottomless, and a long time passed before the ethereal figure spoke, “Master, why did you let him go?”

A long time passed before a ripple came from deep within the abyss.

The ethereal figure hurriedly fell to one knee, “Forgive me.”

The bottom of the abyss regained its calm.

A long time passed before the ethereal figure looked up in the direction Yang Ye and the others had left, and there was bewilderment in its eyes.

At the bottom of the abyss, there was a young girl around the age of 15 who was jumping around while playing with a ball.

If one looked carefully, one would notice that it was no ball, it was a head. A bloody head. And this head’s eyes were still open! Its owner had died with everlasting regret!

The petite girl juggled the head repeatedly with her bare feet and kicked it away from time to time. The head would strike the distant wall and bounce back to her.

She just kept playing happily like that.

Suddenly, she raised a finger, “I’ve repaid my debt to you.”

Far away in a gray and hazy expanse of space, an old man with a bamboo chest on his back stopped abruptly. He shot a glance to the side and nodded slightly, “We don’t owe each other anything now!”

The old man vanished into the distance once he finished speaking.

At the bottom of the abyss, the young girl suddenly kicked the head again. This time, she used a huge amount of strength.

Bang!

The head exploded apart!

The young girl looked up at the distant mountain wall. There was a ferocious beast carved on it. The rear of the demon beast was covered beneath the shadows and impossible to discern. Only its head could be seen!

If Yang Ye was here, he would definitely be extremely shocked!

Because the demon beast had two horns on its head, and those horns were exactly like Erya’s horns!

The young girl gazed at the demon beast, and a long time passed before she turned around, “Get me another ball.”

At this moment, all the beings in the abyss trembled.

…

Yang Ye’s group left the abyss and returned to the edge of it outside.

All of them had cold sweat on their faces!

They’d escaped death!

This trip of theirs could be described as escaping death. Because they’d clearly sensed something very terrifying was looking at them. Especially Yang Ye, he felt like a pair of eyes were looking at him, and that gaze hadn’t been concealed at all.

Danger!

Even though he’d looked calm earlier, tempestuous waves had been surging in his heart.

An extremely dangerous existence was down there!

Meanwhile, Xing Biqing suddenly said, “We made it out safely!”

Yang Ye nodded, and then he flicked the armor over to them.

They exchanged glances. In the end, Xing Biqing said, “Brother Ye, you got the armor and could have left yourself. So, why did you come back to save us?”

Actually, she’d wanted to ask that question for some time now!

Yang Ye had clearly been too selfless! He could have left! He could have taken the armor with him! But he hadn’t! He’d stayed. Moreover, he’d even taken the initiative to give the armor to them!

Yang Ye shook his head and didn’t explain anything. A person could be greedy and ambitious, but a person must have principles and limits.

For example, a person could be amorous, but not a pervert!

They didn’t ask anything else when Yang Ye didn’t answer. Xing Biqing put the armor away and said, “Brother Yang, you’re a true friend. I’m sure you’ll be satisfied with what I have for you once we return to the House of Indulgence.”

Yang Ye smiled, “Thank you!”

Meanwhile, Ye Zhibei suddenly asked, “Can we talk?”

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and nodded.

Xing Biqing said, “You two chat. I’ll wait over there!”Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

She appeared around 1 km away once she finished speaking.

Ye Zhibei took out a cucumber and had a bite before she said, “Return to the Ye Clan with me!”

The Ye Clan!

Yang Ye had quite the headache. He laughed bitterly and was about to say something when Ye Zhibei said, “The Ancient Sword Sect is investigating your background. Not just the Ancient Sword Sect, the Xing Clan too.”

Yang Ye fell silent.

She gazed at him, “I don’t want to find out if you’re really an illegitimate child of my Ye Clan. But you must be one now. It’s beneficial to both the Ye Clan and you, isn’t it?”

Yang Ye fell silent for a short while and said, “Is the Ancient Sword Sect still investigating?”

Ye Zhibei nodded, “They aren’t the only ones. Other powers are doing the same. However, I’ve stopped it all. All of it will vanish if you return to the Ye Clan with me.”

Yang Ye gazed at her, “Do you think I’m a member of the Ye Clan?”

Ye Zhibei replied, “The question is whether you want to be one. If you want it, then you are; if you don’t, then you aren’t!”

Yang Ye gazed at her for a long time before he said, “Alright, I’ll go with you!”

He needed an identity, an identity to use in the Eternal Kingdom!
