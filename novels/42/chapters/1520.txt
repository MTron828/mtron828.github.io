Chapter 1521 - Fight!

Translator: InVader

At the same time that he charged at them, the Sword God’s Seal lit up on his forehead again. After that, his sword intent rose to the Returnal Rank again!

The Sword God’s Seal had no limits on its usage. So long as he could endure the backlash from it, he could constantly raise his sword intent to the Returnal Rank! If it was at any other time, he wouldn’t improve his sword intent to the Returnal Rank. After all, he really didn’t want to experience the backlash from it again. However, if he didn’t improve his sword intent to the Returnal Rank now, then he wouldn’t be able to kill them at all.

Elder Hua and the others’ expressions changed when they saw Yang Ye’s sword intent rise to the Returnal Rank again. Obviously, they hadn’t expected him to still be able to and still dare to utilize that secret technique!

They’d miscalculated!

However, they reacted very quickly. The five remaining Dualism Realm experts swiftly grouped up and stood behind Elder Hua. This time, they didn’t take the initiative to attack like they had previously. Because if they did that, it represented that they would have to get close to Yang Ye. But once they got close to him, it was very likely that they would be killed by a single swing of Yang Ye’s sword!

Elder Hua took a step forward, and then he slapped his right palm at Yang Ye!

Boom!

A terrifying wave of force surged out from the center of his palm, and then the space before him shook violently while Yang Ye was blasted away!

A moment later, Elder Hua took another step forward, and just that allowed him to instantly arrive before Yang Ye.

Yang Ye’s reaction wasn’t slow at all. He immediately fled from where he was, and then he transformed into a ray of light that shot towards the other Dualism Realm experts. The reason he hadn’t executed the Rebirth Sword right away was that those Dualism Realm experts were too far away from him. Since they were so far away, it was very difficult for the Rebirth Sword to kill them in an instant!

Thus, he had to close the distance between him and those Dualism Realm experts!

However, he failed!

As soon as he charged at those Dualism Realm experts, they’d moved backwards again and increased the distance between them and him.

At the same time, Elder Hua appeared in front of Yang Ye again and swung his palm at Yang Ye. This attack was even more terrifying than the last palm attack.

Thunderous rumbling resounded as a wave of invisible force shot out from space, and then it surged at Yang Ye!

At this moment, Yang Ye couldn’t dodge in time, so he had no choice but to go head-on against it. So, he immediately raised the casket lid in front of himself.

Bang!

The force slammed against the casket lid and blasted away both Yang Ye and the casket lid. As for Elder Hua, he didn’t stop, and he immediately pressed forward. His speed was so swift that he immediately appeared in front of Yang Ye again, and then he swung his palm forward once more.

Bang!

Space shook violently, and it seemed like it couldn’t endure the force behind this palm strike. As for Yang Ye who was struck by the force of the strike, he was blasted away. This time, Yang Ye spat out numerous mouthfuls of blood while his arms even cracked apart. However, it didn’t take long for Primordial Violet Energy to repair his arms!

As for Elder Hua, he stuck to Yang Ye like glue and appeared before Yang Ye once more. This time, Yang Ye didn’t just defend himself with the casket lid, and he drew his sword and swung it!

He was very well aware that the old man didn’t want to give him a single chance to survive. If he just defended himself and didn’t counterattack, then only a frenzied wave of attack would be awaiting him.

Three overlapped Heavenrends!

Three overlapped Heavenrends that were enhanced by Quasi Returnal Rank slaughter intent and Returnal Rank sword intent!

Because it was enhanced by Returnal Rank sword intent, it was much stronger than it had ever been. Space seemed to quake violently like an earthquake was running through it, and Elder Hua was blasted 3km away!

Elder Hua looked down at his chest, and he saw that his chest had been slashed open. Moreover, it was so deep that he could see the bones beneath his flesh!

Elder Hua’s eyes narrowed slightly while a solemn expression appeared in his eyes.

The facts proved that Yang Ye’s attacks could pose a threat to him! If he was just at the Dualism Realm, it was very likely that he would have been annihilated in an instant!

Elder Hua gazed at Yang Ye, “Needless to say, you’re truly an extraordinary genius. Unfortunately, a genius like you is bound to perish!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Elder Hua took a step forward and was about to attack. However, Yang Ye’s sword had suddenly vanished.

At the moment Yang Ye’s sword vanished, Elder Hua’s expression changed, and he swiftly slapped his palm forward!

Boom!

An explosion resounded, and Elder Hua was pushed more than 6km back. At the same time that Elder Hua was pushed back, Yang Ye’s figure vanished on the spot, and he was in front of Elder Hua when he appeared once more.

Elder Hua’s eyes narrowed slightly. He didn’t dare underestimate Yang Ye’s attack, and he twisted both his palms and pressed them together before pushing them forward!

However, right when he pushed his palms forward, his eyes suddenly opened wide, “Watch out!”

As soon as he finished speaking, a ray of light flashed. However, Elder Hua wasn’t its target, and it was a Dualism Realm expert who stood not too far away from Elder Hua!

Those Dualism Realm experts instantly understood what was going on, and they were horrified. At this moment, they finally understood that while Yang Ye seemed to be fighting desperately against Elder Hua, it was only an illusion. They were Yang Ye’s true objectives. They’d been constantly watching the battle and waiting for an opportune moment to attack. So, they’d gotten closer and closer to the battlefield without even realizing it.

However, their attention had been focused on the battle, so they hadn’t moved backwards and created distance between them and Yang Ye.

One of the Dualism Realm experts turned pale when he noticed that he was the target of that ray of sword energy. He wasn’t even able to react before it flashed through his throat.

Hiss!

A head flew up into the air while accompanied by a fountain of blood!

Meanwhile, Elder Hua’s attack slapped Yang Ye flying. Even though he had the casket lid to defend himself against the attack, Yang Ye had clearly been injured by it, and his face was extremely pale. At the same time, blood was flowing out incessantly from the corner of his mouth. In just a short while, his entire chest was dyed red with blood!

Even though he had the casket lid to defend himself, the strength of a Rebirth Realm expert was too powerful, and he wasn’t really able to resist it completely. Fortunately, he had the Undying Elemental Body and Primordial Violet Energy. Otherwise, even the casket lid wouldn’t have been able to save him!

Yang Ye withdrew an Energy Pearl and swallowed it, and then countless strands of spirit energy surged throughout his body. It didn’t take long for a huge amount of Primordial Violet Energy to emerge from the Primordial Pagoda, and then it spread throughout his body and repaired his injuries.

Meanwhile, Elder Hua’s gaze descended onto the casket lid in front of Yang Ye. The casket lid was the main reason that Yang Ye could fight him. The casket warded off most of the force from his attacks. If Yang Ye didn’t have that casket lid, then even if Yang Ye’s body was a realm higher and no matter how fast Yang Ye’s recovery was, Yang Ye would still be unable to fight him!

This was a prime example of using equipment to supplement the insufficiencies of one’s cultivation!

After he swallowed an Energy Pearl, Yang Ye’s profound energy was fully recovered, and even his injuries were almost completely healed. Yang Ye looked up at Elder Hua, and he immediately transformed into a ray of light that shot towards the old man.

This time, the four remaining Dualism Realm experts moved backward immediately. They’d realized that while Yang Ye was fighting Elder Hua, they were Yang Ye’s true objectives. But they couldn’t resist a single swing of Yang Ye’s sword. So, they were in quite an embarrassing position!

Four Dualism Realm experts weren’t just unable to kill a Semi-Deity, they didn’t even dare to get close to him!

Even though it was extremely humiliating, they had no other choice.

At this moment, Yang Ye could instantly annihilate any cultivator below the Rebirth Realm!

Yang Ye entered into a fierce battle with Elder Hua again. This time, Elder Hua learned from his mistakes, so even if he retreated, he didn’t retreat in the direction of those Dualism Realm experts.

As they watched Yang Ye fight Elder Hua, they grew more shocked as the battle progressed. Even though Yang Ye was completely suppressed in battle, Yang Ye was just a Semi-Deity!

Was it humiliating for a Semi-Deity to be suppressed by a Rebirth Realm expert? No! It was glorious! If news of it spread, then Yang Ye would definitely be renowned throughout the large world! Actually, his reputation in the large world was quite great already. Besides because of the Emperor Sect, War Pavilion, and Ma Clan, it was mainly because of the Divine Phoenix Sect!

Mo Xiaoleng of the Divine Phoenix Sect had been constantly looking for people to head down to the lower dimensions and kill Yang Ye, and it had given rise to much discussion in the large world!

Now, if news of Yang Ye fighting a Rebirth Realm expert on his own were to spread, then Yang Ye’s name would definitely spread throughout the large world!

Besides feeling shocked, they were fearful as well!

Especially the experts from the Emperor Sect and War Pavilion. Because their Emperor Sect and War Pavilion had no intention to send a Rebirth Realm expert here. So, if the Ma Clan hadn’t sent a Rebirth Realm expert, just ten Dualism Realm experts wouldn’t have been able to do anything to Yang Ye. Moreover, Yang Ye might have even annihilated all of them!

Dualism Realm experts were no threat to Yang Ye anymore!

Moreover, even Rebirth Realm experts would find it difficult to kill Yang Ye unless he was besieged by the joint forces of two Rebirth Realm experts! DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

At this moment, all of them felt quite regretful. They regretted that they hadn’t sought help from their respective sects!

Bang!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye was suddenly blasted flying. However, Elder Hua was similarly pushed around 1km back by a beam of sword energy. Both of them had just been pushed away, but it only took a moment for them to shoot forward at each other again.

If Yang Ye didn’t utilize the Rebirth Sword or overlapped Heavenrends, then he was practically unable to fight back and could only suffer a beating, and he was only able to push Elder Hua back with the Rebirth Sword or overlapped Heavenrends.

It was the gap in their cultivations!

Yang Ye seemed to be able to fight Elder Hua, but there was actually a huge gap between them. However, that gap had been temporarily offset by the Sword God’s Seal and Yang Ye’s equipment!

A quarter of an hour later, Yang Ye executed the last Rebirth Sword that he could execute and created distance between him and Elder Hua again.

Elder Hua immediately shot towards Yang Ye once he stopped himself.

However, Yang Ye didn’t charge forward as well, and he said, “That’s it for today! We’ll continue tomorrow!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye flashed into Heaven’s Door.

Elder Hua was instantly stunned on the spot.
