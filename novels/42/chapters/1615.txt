Chapter 1616 - Surpass The Zenith Realm?

Translator: InVader

There were numerous rivers in Yang Ye’s field of vision, but they weren’t rivers of water, they were rivers of blood!

Numerous rivers of blood were flowing on the ground, and Yang Ye’s field of vision was filled with such rivers!

What was it like for blood to flow into rivers? This was it!

Moreover, the entire sky above the continent surged with a dense aura of blood. It was so dense that even a Dualism Realm expert would find it difficult to endure. Not to mention a Dualism Realm expert, even someone who’d comprehended Returnal Rank slaughter intent like Yang Ye wasn’t really able to endure it!

It was too thick!

Yang Ye remained silent on the spot for a long time, and then he shot towards the east. Because the rivers of blood were flowing towards the east!

Yang Ye gradually started to frown, and a solemn expression appeared on his face as well. Because the rivers of blood didn’t stop at all, and they were actually growing in number instead. If he went up higher and looked down at the ground below, he would notice that the entire continent was like an ocean of blood!

“What happened on this continent?” Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings, and then his profound energy started circulating slowly while he became fully vigilant.

He didn’t stop and continued forward instead. Around two hours later, he saw a city.

Yang Ye still didn’t stop and just entered it. At this moment, the city was completely empty. Yang Ye gazed silently at it. It was like a huge pool of blood because the city was filled with blood, and the blood was flowing towards the east.

Yang Ye looked towards the east. The sky at the end of his vision seemed like it was covered in a red cloth, and it was bloody yet beautiful at the same time!

He fell silent for an instant before he continued forward. However, he’d completely concealed himself now.

Even though he was confident in his own strength, it was best to be cautious! DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Around four hours later, Yang Ye saw another city of blood. This city was at least five times larger than the last one, and the rivers of blood around it were flowing incessantly into the city.

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings, and then he transformed into a shadow that vanished on the spot.

It didn’t take long for Yang Ye to sneak into the city. Just as he’d expected, the city was still filled with blood. Yang Ye didn’t stop, and he just continued forward because the blood was converging into the city.

A short while later, Yang Ye arrived at the center of the city, and then his gaze shot through the ocean of blood to its bottom. There were two figures lying there, two figures of blood.

The reason he considered them figures of blood was because they were fully condensed into form with blood! As for the center of their foreheads, there were two fist-sized black vortexes there. Besides that, Yang Ye noticed that the blood in the city was surging into them!

What the heck is that? A wisp of bewilderment flashed through Yang Ye’s eyes. He was about to head down there to have a look, but his expression suddenly changed, and he quickly stood still on the spot. It didn’t take long for two rays of black light to appear in the sky, and then two black robed men appeared not too far away from Yang Ye.

Zenith Realm experts!

Yang Ye’s face became solemn again when he saw them.

Meanwhile, the black robed man on the left suddenly said, “Fortunately, the Blood Puppets are still here. Otherwise, we wouldn’t be able to avoid being held responsible for their loss.”

The black robed man on the right nodded, “Seventh Young Master exhausted a huge amount of effort to create these Blood Puppets. If they’re lost, then based on Seventh Young Master’s temper, both of us…” They seemed to have thought of something when they spoke up to this point, and their expressions changed.

A moment of silence ensued before the black robed man on the right spoke, “Zuo Feng, how do you think Yang Yan found out about this place?”

The black robed man called Zuo Feng fell silent for a short while, and then he said, “I’m sure you’re aware that the young masters of your Yang Clan are ceaselessly paying attention to each other’s every move. Otherwise, the young master wouldn’t have sent just a few Rebirth Realm cultivators to deal with this. So, we’ve definitely been exposed. However, I’m curious about why the two Blood Puppets weren’t taken.”

The black robed man on the right thought for a moment and said, “Perhaps that fellow suffered heavy injuries in the battle with Li Ming’s group, so he went to get reinforcements?”

Zuo Feng pondered deeply for a short moment and said, “No matter what, these Blood Puppets must be moved.” When he spoke up to this point, he glanced at the blood red figures and said, “What a pity. They just need a little longer to become existences that surpass the Zenith Realm. Now, they’re only equivalent to Zenith Realm experts!”

The black robed man on the right shook his head, “It’s a pity indeed. However, it’s still not bad. Even though they are only equivalent to Zenith Realm experts, their combat strength definitely far surpasses ordinary Zenith Realm experts. It can be said that fighting five Zenith Realm experts each wouldn’t be a problem for them!”

Zuo Feng nodded, “Forget it. We’ll have time to refine them again later. But slaughtering a continent is truly a crime against the balance of the world. Seventh Young Master…”

“Fool!” The other black robed man suddenly said, “Remember that this has nothing to do with Seventh Young Master. It’s we who did it. Understand?”

Zuo Feng fell silent for a long time, and then he said, “Leng Ku, we’re shouldering all this karma!”

The black robed man called Leng Ku said, “Zuo Feng, do you still not understand? So long as Seventh Young Master rises up in the clan, we’ll be able to benefit from his karmic luck and rise up to a higher level as well. Based on our natural talent, the Zenith Realm is our limit. If we don’t rely on karmic luck, we’ll never be able to advance further. We…”

Zuo Feng said, “But what if Seventh Young Master fails?”

Leng Ku fell silent for a long time, “Do we have another choice?”

Silence suddenly filled the surroundings.

Ten breaths of time later, Zuo Feng suddenly said, “Let’s go.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he pressed his right palm downwards. In an instant, the ocean of blood before him split open.

Yang Ye’s expression changed at the sight of this. Because the ocean of blood was moving in his direction. He wasn’t merged into space, so when it passed by him, it slowed down slightly!

Just that slight reduction in its movement caused Zuo Feng and Leng Ku’s expressions to change drastically. After that, Zuo Feng slapped his palm in Yang Ye’s direction.

At the moment he was discovered, Yang Ye immediately withdrew a black robe and wore it. After that, he stomped his right foot down and vanished on the spot. He didn’t flee but went to the blood red figures instead. After that, he waved his right hand and placed them into the Primordial Pagoda.

“How dare you!” As soon as Yang Ye did that, Zuo Feng’s furious shout resounded from behind him. After that, an energy fist appeared above him. It was extremely swift and didn’t give him any time to dodge!

Yang Ye didn’t try to dodge it. He just clenched his right fist tightly and slammed it upwards.

Elemental Breaker combined with energy rebound!

Boom!

The energy fist shook violently and exploded into bits. Meanwhile, Yang Ye was blasted into the ground by the force of the collision.

Zuo Feng and Leng Ku were stunned, and then they vanished on the spot.

Once his figure was underground, Yang Ye stomped his right foot down and transformed into a ray of black light that vanished into the depths of the ground!

Flee!

Flee after taking from them!

Actually, he had to flee. Because he was pretending to be a subordinate of Yang Yan’s. If he executed a sword technique, then his disguise would be meaningless. Moreover, he would gain a powerful enemy.

But if he didn’t execute a sword technique, he couldn’t resist two Zenith Realm experts. Moreover, they were even Zenith Realm experts who hadn’t relied on any external forces to attain the Zenith Realm.

Even though he had the Laws of Darkness, he couldn’t use the Laws of Darkness to kill them without using his sword. Even though his fists were powerful, they were much inferior to his sword.

Even if he could kill a Zenith Realm expert with his fist, he would definitely only be able to kill one but not two. After all, Zenith Realm experts were definitely not fools. Once they noticed that he was able to enter their shadows without making a sound, then they would definitely become vigilant towards it.

Flee!

Flee as quickly as he could!

At this moment, Yang Ye had activated the energy of the Demon God, allowing his body to instantly grow much stronger. At the same time, his speed grew much stronger too.

However, no matter how he sped up, those Zenith Realm experts were following closely behind him!

I can’t let this go on! Yang Ye was thinking in his heart. Even though he wasn’t afraid of a battle of attrition because he had Energy Pearls, constantly fleeing like this would definitely make them call for reinforcements. At that time, he would be finished.

What should I do? Yang Ye’s mind was spinning. However, he still couldn’t think of a way out of this situation. Suddenly, two terrifying auras appeared in the sky, and then two silver armored men appeared not too far away from Yang Ye.

Yang Ye’s face fell at the sight of this. Right when he was about to draw his sword, the two figures behind him had stopped. Moreover, there was vigilance in their eyes. As for the two experts in front of Yang Ye, they had vigilance in their eyes as well.

Yang Ye was slightly stunned when he noticed this, and he said to himself. They’re not on the same side?

Meanwhile, Zuo Feng who stood behind Yang Ye spoke abruptly, “Wu Xin, there’s no enmity between my young master and Young Master Yang Yan. Aren’t you going a little too far by attacking us like this?”

Yang Yan’s people? Yang Ye was stunned again.

Meanwhile, one of the silver armored men in front of Yang Ye was about to speak, but Yang Ye hurriedly said, “I’ve got it! Help me stop them while I deliver it to the young master.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye’s figure vanished into the sky.

The silver armored men were stunned on the spot.
