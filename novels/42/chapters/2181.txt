Chapter 2182 – Brothers!

The god race had 26 Sages right now, but it was clearly not enough when facing the Alliance of All and the two other paths.

If the god race wanted to take advantage of the situation and reap the reward, then it had to wait!

It had to wait until Yang Ye, An Nanjing, and the monkey crippled the Alliance of All!

Only then could the god race be the biggest and final winner!

Zhi’er glanced at Ding Shaoyao and remained silent.

The god race!

She knew that Ding Shaoyao had ultimately chosen to prioritize the god race over her own feelings. She would take Yang Ye’s side when there was no conflict between them, but when there was conflict, she chose the god race!

Of course, she had to. If Ding Shaoyao didn’t take the god race’s side, then Zhi’er would remove Ding Shaoyao from her position without the slightest hesitation.

Even if Yang Ye had shown her kindness, the god race was most important to Zhi’er!

Regardless of whether it was her or Ding Shaoyao, the god race’s interests were everything to them!

The battle in the distance was still going on.

However, at this moment, An Nanjing, the monkey, and Yang Ye were heavily injured. Especially the monkey, one of his arms had been blasted into bits. Besides that, the scales all around his body had been smashed open too, and blood was seeping out incessantly like a fountain from him.

It was extremely shocking!

As for Yang Ye and An Nanjing, their condition wasn’t much better.

Fight!

As far as they were concerned, they could only fight, fight to the death!

Suddenly, ripples surged through the battlefield, and then an invisible barrier appeared here. A moment later, 11 women appeared on the battlefield.

They were led by Sky Maiden!

Sky Maiden looked off into the distance, and then ferocity flashed through her eyes. An instant later, she opened her eyes and roared. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Boom!

A huge mouth suddenly appeared like a beast that could swallow the universe, and bit down at the Sages in the distance.

Heaven Devourer!

At this moment, the mouth seemed like it could devour the heavens.

The Sages there were shocked. They didn’t dare act carelessly, and the Spirit God shot upward and waved his hands. An invisible wave of force surged out like a torrent from his palms.

BOOM!

Beams of energy slammed incessantly against the mouth. Besides that, the Devil Monarch waved his right hand, and a huge black tombstone shot upward and smashed itself against the mouth.

Bang!

The mouth cracked open and transformed into countless fragments of energy that rained down through the battlefield.

Meanwhile, Sky Maiden spat out multiple mouthfuls of blood, and her countenance instantly turned extremely pale!

However, her interference had bought Yang Ye, the monkey, and An Nanjing some time to rest, and they immediately converged together.

Nether Maiden and the others couldn’t bear to look at them when they saw the horrifying state Yang Ye and the others were in.

At this moment, Yang Ye was covered in blood. It was impossible to discern if the blood belonged to him or his enemies. Besides that, his sword was covered in chipped areas, those chips in his sword had been forcefully smashed open during battle. Moreover, if one looked carefully, one would notice that his entire body was covered in injuries. While he had the Primordial Armor, it couldn’t be used without restraint, and he could only use it at critical moments!

So, at most times, he could only use his body to forcefully resist the attacks thrown at him!

An Nanjing was slightly better, just slightly.

Her instinct in combat was extraordinary. So, while they could injure her, it was very difficult for them to cause lethal damage to her when she wanted to dodge their attacks. However, she wasn’t in a much better state. While she hadn’t lost any limbs, her internal organs had cracked open.

It had been cracked open by the force of the impact she suffered!

The Devil Monarch gazed at Sky Maiden’s group, “Who are all of you?!”

Sky Maiden glanced at the Devil Monarch’s group, and then she gazed at Yang Ye, “Are you alright?”

Yang Ye wiped off the blood on the corner of his mouth and gazed at them, “W-Why did you come?”

Meanwhile, she walked over to Yang Ye, rubbed his head, and said, “Since you call us your sisters, we naturally have to take your side. We’ve left the Nether Pavilion.”

Yang Ye shook his head. He was just about to speak when blood seeped out of his mouth before he could say anything. Yang Ye wiped off the blood on the corners of his mouth again and said, “A-All of you will die. Listen to me and leave… leave now. You still can make it.”

Blood Maiden smiled, “Would you stand by idly if we’re attacked by a group of experts?”

Yang Ye wanted to say something else, but Blood Maiden shook her head, “Forget that, just leave with us!”

“Leave?” A vicious glow flashed through the Devil Monarch’s eyes, “How laughable! Can you even leave?”

As soon as he said that, a few dozen Sages surrounded all of them.

The Sages of the entire Alliance of All were over 100 in number. Besides those who had died in battle earlier, there were still over 100 here! Besides the god race, it could be considered as the entire force of the large universe.

Sky Maiden closed her eyes slowly.

She’d expected this, but she’d still chosen to come.

Die with Yang Ye?

They hadn’t thought that much about it, and Sky Maiden hadn’t given it any thought. After she awakened completely, there was something she could never forget, and it was that only a single person stood by her side when Profounder Continent was on the verge of collapse and the Eye of the Heaven Dao wanted to kill her. That person told her that she didn’t have to be afraid because he was there! That person was Yang Ye.

Besides that, Yang Ye stepped forward when the others from the Nether Pavilion were in trouble.

She’d planned to come alone today, but her plan had failed. Nether Maiden and the others had chosen to come, and none of them had tried to stop her!

Sky Maiden closed her eyes slowly, “Since you refuse to let us go, then let’s fight!”

“Count me in!” Suddenly, a voice came from afar, and Yang Ye looked over to its source.

The owner of the voice had a robust figure and a spiked club on her resting against her shoulder. It was none other than A’Man.

Yang Ye shook his head, “Big Sister Man, what are you doing here? You…”

Meanwhile, A’Man said, “I gave it some thought and decided to do this in the end. If I don’t come, I will never be able to rest at ease. Who can live forever in this world? I think no one can accomplish that. Now, it’s the End Times, so I may die at any moment. Since only death awaits, isn’t it better to die with a brother?”

“Haha!” Suddenly, roaring laughter came from afar. They looked over and saw a group of young men flashing over.

It was none other than Yu Jing who was leading them, and Mad Saber, Qin Chuan, and Ling among them too. All of the others by Yu Jing’s side were the other brothers who had gone through life and death with Yang Ye in the Dead Dimension!

Qin Chuan and the others went over to Yang Ye’s side, and then Qin Chuan chuckled, “Are you very surprised? Is it a huge pleasant surprise? Haha!”

Yang Ye shook his head, “This really isn’t necessary. Even if you didn’t come, I would still consider all of you as my brothers. I…”

Qin Chuan shook his head and interrupted Yang Ye, “You’re wrong. What are brothers? We go through thick and thin together, that’s what brothers do. Only useless trash brothers would only share in the happiness but refuse to help when difficulties arise.”

Mad Saber nodded, “Indeed.”

Meanwhile, Ling who didn’t really like to talk said, “We know what you’re worried about. Indeed, you and An Nanjing are the most dazzling geniuses in the younger generation of the large universe right now, but who’s below both of you? It’s all of us who crawled out of the Dead Dimension. We may be unable to kill a Sage, but if I’m willing to risk my life, then I have at least a 50% chance to kill a Sage!”

Qin Chuan chuckled, “I’m a little better, I have around a 55% chance. Haha!”

Yang Ye glanced at them and said, “All that matters is the heart. I would still consider all of you as brothers even if you didn’t come. This is my own personal business, and it really isn’t necessary to interfere in this. Moreover, it really isn’t necessary to drag down your clans and sects for me. All of you aren’t alone, you have to think about the organizations you represent.”

“We’re all alone now!” Qin Chuan said abruptly, “We left our clans and sects before coming. Presently, we have no link to our former clans and sects. We are alone, and we only represent ourselves.”

Yang Ye gazed at them for a long time and said, “Is it worth it? You’ll die!”

“When did you become so long-winded?” Yu Jing suddenly said, “This isn’t the Yang Ye we knew.”

“Exactly!” Qin Chuan added, “You’re actually speaking about whether it’s worth it. You could have left safely by yourself in the Dead Dimension, yet you turned around and came back for us. Did you consider if it was worth it at the time? Moreover, if it wasn’t for you, we would have died in the Dead Dimension. As far as we are concerned, dying in the End Times is really not worth it, but dying with you in battle is really worth it.”

Yang Ye laughed bitterly, “All of you…”

The group from the Nether Pavilion and A’Man’s group.

Besides Sky Maiden, all of them weren’t Sages. However, they were the greatest geniuses in the large universe besides An Nanjing and Yang Ye!

If Yang Ye and An Nanjing didn’t exist, they would be the most dazzling geniuses in the large universe.

The reason they weren’t that renowned was mainly because of Yang Ye and An Nanjing’s presence.

They were too brilliant and casted a shadow upon the other geniuses.

Simply speaking, if they died here today, then even if the other races could survive through the End Times, they would have a lack of experts in a generation. In other words, they would have no one to continue leading their respective races!

The Devil Monarch and the others understood this, but they had no other choice.

The Devil Monarch closed his eyes slowly, “Kill!”

Suddenly, a sword howl resounded from afar, and then a ray of sword energy tore through space and descended here.

Everyone looked toward it.

Yang Ye was slightly stunned, “It feels familiar…”
