Chapter 1790 – Full Force!

One on one!

One on one against a 6th stage True Realm expert!

Yang Ye wasn’t nervous at all, and he was quite excited instead. Because he wanted to see if his current strength was sufficient to kill a 6th stage True Realm expert. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Yang Ye gazed at Ying Qing’s group. They glanced coldly at him, and then gazed at Ying Yu.

Ying Yu waved his hand, and the others moved over 10km back.

“Be careful!” Yang Lianshuang led the others away once she finished speaking.

Only Yang Ye and Ying Yu remained here!

They exchanged glances in midair, and then Yang Ye vanished on the spot. He was in front of Ying Yu when he appeared again. At the same time, a sword stabbed towards Ying Yu’s forehead.

It was extremely fast. Ying Qing and the others were merely able to sense it yet couldn’t see its movements.

Even though they couldn’t see it, Ying Yu could.

Two fingers clamped down on the sword when it arrived around a finger away from Ying Yu’s forehead.

Ying Yu gazed at Yang Ye, “It’s slightly faster than before. But it’s still….”

Suddenly, Yang Ye twisted the sword.

At this moment, Ying Yu’s expression changed slightly, and he hurriedly released the sword. Meanwhile, the sword stabbed forward towards his face.

Ying Yu didn’t dare act carelessly and immediately slapped his right palm against Yang Ye’s sword.

Bang!

An explosion resounded, and then both of them were blasted back repeatedly.

Yang Ye was pushed over 300m back while Ying Yu was pushed less than 150m back.

Yang Ye was at a disadvantage in this collision.

However, Ying Yu’s expression gradually became solemn. Yang Ye was only at the 1st stage of the True Realm while he was at the 6th stage of the True Realm. It wasn’t exaggerated to call the gap between them a chasm.

However, he felt powerless against Yang Ye.

If Yang Ye attained the 6th stage of the True Realm, how strong would Yang Ye be?

Ying Yu had a complicated expression on his face when he thought of that. He glanced at Yang Ye. If it was possible, he would never allow the Ying Clan to become enemies with the Yang Clan. Because this enemy before him had aroused fear in him.

Unfortunately, it was too late now!

He restrained his thoughts and slowly clenched his right fist. A moment later, Ying Yu stretched it forward and made a grasping motion in Yang Ye’s direction.

Yang Ye’s expression changed, and then the space around him suddenly exploded apart. The powerful force of the explosion caused Yang Ye’s figure to tremble. At the same time, a huge energy fist arrived before him.

Yang Ye’s pupils constricted slightly, and he raised his sword and swung it.

Bang!

The huge fist instantly cracked apart, but Yang Ye was blasted 300m away. As soon as he stopped himself, the space around him collapsed again. Right when he was about to use the Laws of Darkness within the black hole, a black shadow arrived in front of him, and then a wave of powerful energy slammed at him!

Bang!

Yang Ye was blasted over 1km away again!

Yang Lianshuang and the others’ faces fell at the sight of this.

As soon as Yang Ye stopped himself, Ying Yu’s voice resounded again, “Modify!”

The space around Yang Ye suddenly trembled, and then it started warping and spinning. At the same time, a wave of invisible force coiled around Yang Ye like a chain.

At the instant the force bound him, Yang Ye felt uncomfortable throughout his body. It was like his internal organs were about to be crushed into bits!

Yang Ye didn’t dare hold back.

Bang!

A wave of powerful intent suddenly swept out from Yang Ye, and then the space around him instantly collapsed. At the same time, the chains around him were obliterated!

Enlightened Rank sword intent!

The expressions of everyone here changed.

Especially Ying Yu. At this moment, his eyes were filled with disbelief, “The Enlightened Rank, your sword intent has actually attained the Enlightened Rank. How can this be possible..?”

Yang Ye glanced at Ying Yu and remained silent. A moment later, he vanished on the spot, and a speck of light suddenly appeared in front of Ying Yu.

Split Second!

Split Second that was enhanced by sword intent!

Ying Yu’s expression changed drastically. He didn’t dare act carelessly, so he overlapped his palms and slammed them forward.

Bang!

A loud explosion resounded, and then Ying Yu was blasted over 1km back!

Ying Qing and the others’ expressions became extremely unsightly. They hadn’t expected Yang Ye to be that strong and to the point that he could even blast away a 6th stage True Realm expert!

At this moment, even Ying Qing felt regretful!

He regretted choosing to become enemies with the Yang Clan and Yang Ye for a little gain. That decision had already made the Ying Clan pay a terrible price, and now it seemed like that price wasn’t enough.

Meanwhile, Nether Maiden and the others exchanged glances. In the end, she shook her head slightly and spoke softly, “That fellow has actually become so strong!”

Actually, Ying Yu and the mothers weren’t the only ones who were shocked, even Nether Maiden, Yang Lianshuang, and the others were shocked too. Because they too had never expected Yang Ye to be that strong.

Yang Ye took a deep breath, and then he stomped his right foot down and transformed into a ray of light that shot towards Ying Yu. At the moment he vanished, a long spatial rift appeared in front of Ying Yu.

Bang!

Meanwhile, rumbling resounded, and then Ying Yu was blasted over 1km away again. However, he hadn’t even stopped himself before Yang Ye transformed into a ray of light that arrived in front of him.

The powerful sword energy Yang Ye emanated minced open the space in Yang Ye’s path!

Yang Ye’s sword hadn’t even arrived before him, but the powerful energy contained within Yang Ye’s heart made Ying Yu’s heart palpitate with fear!

Ying Yu didn’t dare act carelessly at all. His profound energy surged madly, and then he waved his hands. In an instant, countless powerful beams of light surged out explosively from within him, and they instantly enveloped Yang Ye’s sword energy!

However, it only took an instant for those beams of light to be sliced into pieces, and then Yang Ye’s sword arrived before Ying Yu.

It was extremely swift and impossible to dodge!

At the critical moment, Ying Yu forcefully moved his body to the side and vanished on the spot. However, his right arm wasn’t able to leave with him.

A bloody arm slowly descended from midair.

At this moment, Ying Qing and the others’ expressions grew even more unsightly!

After he stopped, Ying Yu glanced at his right arm. There was nothing there. He fell silent for a moment, and then he looked up at Yang Ye, “Good! Very good! Geniuses truly do appear in every generation!”

As soon as he finished speaking, his body suddenly started floating up slowly, and his expression started growing fiercer.

“Using an ultimate move?” Yang Ye looked up at Ying Yu while the last remaining profound energy within him started to circulate.

He didn’t underestimate Ying Yu!

Even though he’d severed one of Ying YU’s arms, he didn’t underestimate Ying Yu at all, nor did he dare to underestimate Ying Yu!

Ying Yu’s aura suddenly rose explosively, and as it grew greater and greater, the space in a huge area started to tremble. It was like an earthquake surging through space.

A moment of silence ensued, and then Yang Ye suddenly gazed at Yang Ye and spoke fiercely, “Heaven Reflection Palm!”

He vanished on the spot once he finished speaking.

After that, the space around Yang Ye suddenly started to tremble, and then countless energy palms flashed out from the space around Yang Ye before slamming down at Yang Ye in succession.

In just an instant, Yang Ye was enveloped by them.

But it only took a moment for rays of sword energy to shoot up into the sky, and they ceaselessly sliced through everything in the surroundings.

Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!

Loud explosions resounded incessantly.

At this moment, Ying Qing, Yang Lianshuang, and the others had moved extremely far back.

They were staring towards the distance without blinking. There were countless energy palms flashing out incessantly from the space there, and they simply seemed endless. Under such circumstances, the sword energy was growing fewer and fewer in number.

They weren’t just growing fewer in number; they were growing darker!

Yang Lianshuang and the others slowly clenched their fists when they witnessed this!

Suddenly, a furious shout resounded. It was Yang Ye’s voice.

After that, six black rays of light shot up into the air, and then the rays of light started to circle the air above Yang Ye. An instant later, they crisscrossed and sliced through the area around him.

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!

The space in a huge area around Yang Ye was sliced into pieces by the six rays of light, and those energy palms were sliced up as well.

Around ten breaths of time later, the surroundings gradually fell quiet.

Yang Ye and Ying Yu’s figures appeared within everyone’s fields of vision. At this moment, Yang Ye’s countenance was pale, and there was a wisp of extremely striking scarlet red on the corner of his mouth. Besides that, the chest area of his clothes had turned blood red.

Moreover, there was a palm print at the center of his chest, and it was extremely deep, causing his chest to seem like it had caved in.

Ying Yu’s state wasn’t much better. His left arm was gone. Moreover, his entire body was covered in injuries!

Yang Ye and Ying Yu’s eyes met for a few moments, and then Ying Yu suddenly said, “His profound energy has been exhausted. You can attack now.”

As soon as he finished speaking, the space in the surroundings trembled, and then 70 people appeared. The leader of the group was the Lu Clan’s patriarch, Lu Yuntian, and the Li Clan, Wang Clan, and Qin Clan’s patriarchs were by his side.

The five clans were here in full force!

Meanwhile, Nether Maiden and the others flashed over to Yang Ye’s side and surrounded him.

The battle was about to erupt at any moment!
