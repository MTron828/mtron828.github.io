Chapter 1269 – I’ll Take You Down With Me!

He wanted to leave!

But the problem was that he couldn’t leave. Even if he could flee, he would merely be able to flee for a while. Moreover, fleeing would only cause the situation to grow progressively worse. Because all 3 of them were Voiders, so their profound energy far surpassed his. If he tried to continue fleeing, then how would he fight 3 Voiders once his profound energy dried up?

He had a chance if he fought right now!

Because that black robed old man and mysterious assassin were heavily injured, and they hadn’t had a chance to heal because they were pursuing him. Especially that mysterious assassin who was hiding somewhere in the surroundings. That assassin had suffered a swing of his sword. So, it could be said that 2 out of the 3 Voiders were injured!

As for himself, while he’d suffered heavy injuries earlier, his speed of recovery was swift! His injuries had recovered by almost 60% now. It was his advantage. Of course, it was his only advantage. Because while 2 of them were injured, they still had the strength to fight, and they had a completely uninjured companion as well!

In short, he had no other choice but to fight now!

Yang Ye held tightly onto Heaven’s Gravestone in his right hand while his gaze descended onto the black robed old man. It was the old man with the spear. At this moment, he had just an arm left. It was naturally possible for the old man to restore his arm with the cultivation he possessed. However, that was only under ordinary circumstances. Since his arm had been cut off by a sword that carried Rebirth Rank sword intent, it wasn’t that easy to restore his arm!

There was naturally a reason why his gaze had descended onto the black robed old man. He was very well aware of the situation that he was in, and it was impossible for him to fight 3 Voiders for too long. So, he had to end the battle quickly. If he wanted to accomplish that, he had to deal with one of them first, and the injured black robed old man was naturally the best choice.

Yang Ye didn’t attack as he intended to buy as much time as he could. Because he still didn’t have enough profound energy!

“Yang Ye!” The grey robed old man gazed at Yang Ye and said, “You killed those 2 members of my Yuan Clan, right?”

Yang Ye replied, “Indeed!”

The grey robed old man’s eyes narrowed slightly, “Yang Ye, there’s no enmity between my Yuan Clan and you, so why did you kill them?”

Yang Ye revealed a slight smile, “Why don’t you guess?”

The grey robed old man’s face fell. Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly said, “I presume all 3 of you are from the Veiled Region!”

The grey robed old man frowned, “How do you know about our Veiled Region!?”

Yang Ye replied, “Someone told me, of course. I’d like to ask all of you a question. Both my Sword Alliance and I don’t have any enmity with your Veiled Region, right? Of course, let’s not talk about the Yuan Clan. There’s enmity between us, so they can’t be blamed for wanting to kill me.” When he spoke up to this point, Yang Ye gazed at the black robed old man and said, “But you’re probably not from the Yuan Clan, right? And that other one hiding somewhere, you’re probably not from the Yuan Clan as well, right? I, Yang Ye, have no enmity with both of you, so why do you try to kill me?”

The black robed old man spoke coldly, “What do you think?”

Yang Ye smiled, “All of you refuse to tolerate the rise of my Sword Alliance. Is that it?”

The black robed old man replied, “Since you know, then why ask?”

Yang Ye answered, “I just wanted to confirm the answer!”

The black robed old man spoke coldly, “And then?”

Yang Ye shrugged, “I’m one who doesn’t like trouble, but if others look for trouble with me, I don’t fear it. Since the Veiled Region has taken my Sword Alliance to be an enemy of it, then it can’t be helped. My Sword Alliance has no choice but to treat you as enemies.”

The grey robed old man said, “Yang Ye, I admit that you’re an outstanding genius, and you really can pose a threat to our Veiled Region if you’re allowed to grow. Even now, you’re a threat to us. However, using your current strength and the current strength of the Sword Alliance to fight our Veiled Region is just a joke. We aren’t going to destroy the Sword Alliance; we intend to share it amongst ourselves. Otherwise, it would only take an instant for us to crush it.”

Yang Ye fell silent for a long time before he said, “How about I lead the Sword Alliance to surrender to the Veiled Region?”

The grey robed old man and black robed old man were stunned when they heard him.

Surrender?Yang Ye wants to surrender? With the Sword Alliance as well?

The grey robed old man clearly felt that his ears were deceiving him and asked again, “You’re saying that you intend to surrender?”

Yang Ye nodded with a serious expression on his face, “I’m sure you’ve realized that my Sword Alliance stands no chance against the Veiled Region. No matter how strong I am, can I triumph over all the Voiders of the Veiled Region? If my Sword Alliance and I want to survive, we have no choice but to surrender.”

The old men exchanged glances. They hadn’t expected that Yang Ye would surrender. Why? Yang Ye was the strongest in the younger generation, and he was the strongest sword cultivator on the continent. How could such a person possibly have no pride? Surrender? How could that be possible!? They hadn’t imagined that Yang Ye would actually choose to surrender now!

Surrender!

At the same time that they felt surprised, a trace of contempt had arisen in their hearts. They’d thought that while Yang Ye was their enemy, they held some respect towards him. Because even though Yang Ye was just a Quasi Emperor, his strength had even surpassed the Voider Realm. Possessing such strength at such an age naturally made him someone worthy of respect!

However, they hadn’t expected that Yang Ye had no pride at all, and he’d actually chosen to surrender just to survive!

Contempt!

Both of them had some contempt and disdain towards Yang Ye!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye added, “Seniors, the wise submit to fate. I, Yang Ye, know when I have to submit. I can surrender, but I have a request!”

The grey robed old man glanced at Yang Ye and said, “Go on!”

Yang Ye continued, “Actually, my request is very simple....” Yang Ye gazed at them and added, “May I know if the two of you can represent the Veiled Region?”

The grey robed old man replied, “We can!”

Yang Ye nodded, “Actually, my request is extremely simple. It’s that... you....”

Yang Ye hesitated to speak at this point.

The grey robed old man frowned, “Yang Ye, you have to understand the situation you’re in right now. Don’t even think about raising any harsh....”

“Wait out!” A shout suddenly resounded.

As soon as that voice resounded, Yang Ye had suddenly vanished on the spot. At that very same instant, the grey robed old man’s expression instantly changed drastically, and he practically instinctively slammed his hammer forward!

Clang!

A sword collided against his hammer, and it caused dazzling sparks to spray towards the surroundings. The grey robed old man’s arms shook violently while his hammer almost flew out of his grasp. However, while he still held on tightly to it, his figure was pushed around 300m back instead. As for Yang Ye, he’d instantly appeared in front of the grey old man and swung his sword once more!

The grey robed old man’s pupils constricted. He wanted to dodge, but the problem was that he’d lost the initiative. So, he couldn’t dodge at all. After all, Yang Ye’s speed was too swift, and he’d put his guard down just now. He had no choice but to go head-on against Yang Ye! After personally experiencing Yang Ye’s terrifying strength, he didn’t dare act carelessly at all. He took his hammer in both hands and raised it to stop Yang Ye’s sword! Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Bang!

The iron hammer exploded apart before the grey robed old man’s astonished gaze, and the powerful aftershock of the collision struck him to the point of coughing up mouthfuls of blood while his figure was blasted away.

Yang Ye didn’t follow up with another attack because a spear had shot over from his left. At the same time, a dagger had suddenly appeared behind his head as well.

Yang Ye’s expression didn’t change at all. The Phantom Shield moved behind his head to defend him against the dagger while he launched a backhand swing at the spear.

Clang! Clang!

Two explosions resounded. Heaven’s Gravestone shook violently while the spear was blasted away. Yang Ye paid no attention to the Voider behind him, nor did he pay any attention to the black robed old man. He just transformed into a ray of light that shot towards the grey robed man.

The grey robed man’s expression changed when he saw Yang Ye target him. However, his reaction wasn’t slow at all. A saber appeared in his grasp, and he took it in both hands before swinging it at Yang Ye.

Bang!

The sword and saber collided, and a terrifying wave of energy swept out from the center of the collision. The wave of energy blasted both Yang Ye and the old man backwards.

However, Yang Ye’s figure had just started moving backwards when a spear tore through the air towards him. This time, the energy it contained was much more terrifying than before!

Yang Ye didn’t use the Phantom Shield to stop it. Compared to the black robed old man, he was more fearful of the mysterious Voider that appeared out of thin air.

Yang Ye twisted his right hand slightly, and he stabbed his sword at the spear.

A ray of blood red light flashed.

Bang!

The black robe old man was blasted backwards with his spear in hand while the powerful force of the collision pushed Yang Ye towards the left. At the same time, he spat out a mouthful of blood. After all, he hadn’t even been able to stabilize himself upon colliding twice in succession with the grey robed old man, and he’d forcefully resisted another attack from the black robed old man right after that. Even though he’d pushed the black robed old man back, he’d still suffered injuries!

However, such injuries were nothing to him!

Right when he finally stopped his figure, the space behind him rippled before a dagger stabbed at the back of his head!

The mysterious Voider had no intention to give him room to breathe!

Yang Ye ignored the Voider behind him, and he gazed at the grey robed old man instead, “The Yuan Clan! I, Yang Ye, swear to crush you. Even if I die, I’ll take you down with me to repay the enmity from that day!”

As soon as he finished speaking, a dagger struck against the Phantom Shield on the back of his head. Even though it couldn’t pierce through the Phantom Shield, the powerful force of the collision still made Yang Ye’s body tremble. However, Yang Ye stomped his right foot down and shot towards the grey robed old man again.

The grey robed old man was stunned when he heard Yang Ye.

He swears to crush my Yuan Clan? He wants to take me down with him? The enmity from that day? The grey robed old man was utterly stunned. There is enmity between my Yuan Clan and him, but it was the members of my Yuan Clan that died! He wants to take me down with him?

The grey robed old man felt that the Yuan Clan hadn’t done anything horrible to Yang Ye!

But he didn’t have the time to think because Yang Ye had arrived in front of him, so he took the saber in both hands and flicked it upwards.

Bang!

The grey robed old man was blasted backwards. Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly pressed his sword against the center of his forehead, “Old dog from the Yuan Clan! I’ll kill you with this!”

As soon as he finished speaking, a wave of terrifying aura surged out explosively from within Yang Ye.

“Watch out!” The black robed old man’s expression changed, and he hurriedly warned the grey robed old man before charging at Yang Ye. After all, it was obvious that Yang Ye intended to execute some sort of formidable technique.

The grey robed old man’s face became extremely solemn as well. He waved his right hand and formed countless profound energy barriers around him. At the same time, the space before him started to overlap and shrink....

Suddenly, Yang Ye vanished on the spot.

The grey robed old man’s pupils instantly constricted. Suddenly, a shocked voice resounded, “Old Man Ye, watch out! You’re his target!”

The black robed old man was slightly stunned. A moment later, his eyes instantly opened wide while his hairs stood on end.
