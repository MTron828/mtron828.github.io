Chapter 2495 – Ye Yang, Yang Yang Ye!

Mo Ya suddenly asked, “Yang Ye’s a sword cultivator too?”

The young man nodded, “He is!”

Mo Ya grinned slightly, “That’s quite interesting. I didn’t expect such a genius to exist in a world like that. I only wonder if he’ll still be a genius if compared with our Ancient Sword Sect’s geniuses!”

Suddenly, someone said, “He’s definitely a piece of trash!”

Everyone looked over to Yang Ye because he’d spoken those words!

Yang Ye said, “Just think about it. Is it even possible to kill someone at the Five World Realm while at the True Void Realm? It’s absolutely impossible! So, as far as I’m concerned, it’s definitely an exaggeration.”

He clenched his fists at this point, “If I encounter him, I’ll crush him with just two punches!”

The young man glanced at Yang Ye, “It’s good to be confident!”

Yang Ye smiled, “Anyway, may I know your name?”

The young man replied indifferently, “Li Mu. Remember that some others will be joining the War Dimension too. Fighting isn’t prohibited in the War Dimension. However, you cannot kill or cripple anyone. Otherwise, the consequences are very serious.”

Yang Ye hurriedly asked, “How serious?”

The others couldn’t help but glance at him.

This fellow has violent inclinations!

Li Mu said, “You’ll either be exiled from the War Dimension or sent to a place. Trust me, you won’t want to be there. It’s countless times more terrifying than death!”

Yang Ye wanted to ask more questions, but they had emerged from the teleportation formation.

They appeared in a gray and hazy world. The entire world was gloomy, and the smell of decaying corpses and blood filled the surroundings. Besides that, they could see severed limbs from time to time, and they belonged to both humans and demons.

“A battlefield!” Meanwhile, Li Mu spoke abruptly, “You’re at the War Dimension now, and this is a battlefield, and it’s your final test. Pass through this battlefield and travel 500,000km to get to War City. You can only walk all the way. Of course, you can’t fly on your swords. Remember that you have no way back now, and the only way out is death. But if you die here, your sect won’t avenge you. You would have died for nothing. If you give up now, you will bring shame to both your sect and clans. Of course, we don’t allow anyone to give up. So, good luck!”

Li Mu withdrew a golden talisman and crushed it, and then he vanished on the spot.

Only Yang Ye and the others remained here.

Walk all the way!

After staying silent for a short while, Xue Yiren spoke abruptly, “I think we should join forces. What do all of you think?”

Yang Ye nodded. He had no objections because he didn’t really want to use the sword. He wanted to keep a low profile as long as possible. But if he didn’t use his sword, then it would probably be extremely difficult to get to War City!

Because he saw a corpse to the right. It belonged to a demon beast, and it was at the Five World Realm!

Mo Ya and Lu Yunxian nodded to display their agreement.

It wasn’t the time to fight on their own!

Xue Yiren nodded, “Come on! Good luck to us!”

They walked off into the distance. They had extremely vigilant expressions on their faces. Yang Ye was extremely vigilant toward the surroundings as well because he kept having the feeling that many eyes were locked on them.

Around 15 minutes later, the ground before them quaked, and they readied themselves to enter battle. However, their expressions changed when they saw the scene ahead. It didn’t take long for them to simultaneously run the other way!

Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam!

A group of demons were coming from behind them. They looked like lions, yet were colossi that were many times larger than an ordinary lion. Moreover, there were over a dozen of them, and all of them were at the Four World Realm!

That was a lethal issue!

All four of them were fleeing madly!

Yang Ye naturally had to flee as well. If he used his sword, he could annihilate them with ease. However, it would be too shocking. His identity couldn’t withstand being investigated carefully!

They fled extremely swiftly, but the demon beasts were even faster!

A short while later, Yang Ye suddenly said, “We can’t continue like this. There are definitely more of them here. If we just flee, we’ll be finished if we run into their lair.”

Mo Ya suddenly asked, “So you want to fight them?”

Yang Ye nodded, “What else can we do?”

Mo Ya fell silent.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye said, “I’ve counted, and there are a total of 12 demon beasts behind us. So, we’ll each take three. Any objections?”

Mo Ya and the others fell silent for a few breaths of time, and then Xue Yiren broke the silence, “Alright!”

Meanwhile, Lu Yunxian said, “Alright!”

Mo Ya took a deep breath, “Then let’s fight!”

As soon as she said that, they stopped and turned around to gaze at those demon beasts. All of them had extremely solemn expressions on their faces. Those demon beasts were like a horde as they charged over, and the imposing aura they emanated was simply one which could crush the world!

Yang Ye shook his head as he gazed at them. Erya could fight a few dozens of them on her own! And if Snowy and Erya were both here, the demon beasts would either be beaten down or take the initiative to surrender instead!

Yang Ye suddenly missed them when he thought of them! He wondered if they missed him too! And An Nanjing too!

Yang Ye shook his head and stopped thinking about it. He just charged at the demon beasts!

Once they saw Yang Ye charge first, Xue Yiren and the others didn’t hesitate to charge at the demon beasts as well.

Yang Ye’s gaze descended onto the demon which was leading the charge. At this moment, it was looking at him too, and there was undisguised ferocity in its eyes.

It didn’t take long for them to get closer and closer to each other!

Suddenly, Yang Ye leaped up and arrived above the demon, and there was a tombstone in his grasp!

It was the tombstone that Erya had obtained that day, and she’d forgotten to take it with her. So, it was his to use now.

Yang Ye swung the tombstone down with both hands.

Meanwhile, the demon beast didn’t dodge and slammed itself against the tombstone.

Bang!

An explosion resounded like a thunderclap, and then the demon howled in agony and crashed down to the ground. Meanwhile, Yang Ye was blasted into the air as well. However, he slammed the tombstone down in midair because another demon beast had charged at him!

Bang!

The demon beast was slammed down to the ground!

Bloodline Energy!

While Yang Ye wasn’t using his sword, he was using his bloodline. With the strength from his Bloodline Energy, he wasn’t any weaker to a Four World Realm demon beast. However, right after he slammed away the 2nd demon beast, a third slammed against him.

Boom!

Yang Ye was blasted away. His head droned as if there were countless bees buzzing through it!

Suddenly, the demon appeared before Yang Ye again and slapped its claw at his head.

In the Primordial Pagoda, Oxxy was about to charge out with the Primordial Axe of Creation upon witnessing this. But Sword Scroll stopped him.

Oxxy was clearly quite anxious, and so were the others. Even if they ignored reasons that were linked to Erya and Snowy, while they weren’t very close to Yang Ye, they had been with him for a long time. So, they treated him as one of their own. Or it should be said that they’d subconsciously acknowledged him as one of their own.

If Oxxy was in danger, the others would definitely not stand by idly. While they weren’t the same species of demon beast, they were a part of this family in the Primordial Pagoda!

Sword Scroll spoke softly, “It’s fine, he’ll be alright!”

Yang Ye shook his head when he sensed the powerful approaching force, and then he slammed a punch at the demon beast.

Bang!

Yang Ye was blasted away again!

As for the demon beast, it was slammed to the ground!

However, this little bit of impact was well within the limits of its endurance!

It didn’t take long for all three demon beasts to stand up on their feet and gaze at Yang Ye. This time, their eyes were filled with the desire to kill!

Obviously, Yang Ye had utterly infuriated them!

Yang Ye spat out the blood in his mouth. Only now did he realize that he was a fucking sword cultivator, and he was actually so weak when without his sword!

Meanwhile, the three demon beasts charged at Yang Ye. This time, faint red light arose around them. In an instant, their figures grew larger, and the auras they emanated were much stronger too!

Their target was Yang Ye!

Yang Ye’s eyelids twitched because he knew that they were serious now!

Yang Ye took a deep breath and waved his right hand. The tombstone flew toward him, and he embraced it in both arms before charging at them!

The demons were stunned by the sight of this. Is that fellow that fierce?

They naturally wouldn’t shrink back from this and charged forward!

Meanwhile, Sword Scroll’s voice resounded in Yang Ye’s mind, “What are you trying to do?”

What was he trying to do?

Yang Ye had a ferocious smile on his lips, “My body is extremely powerful too. I’m going to kill these fellows with my physical strength!”

Sword Scroll shook her head, “You’re asking for a beating!”

Yang Ye’s body was extremely good when compared to others in his realm of cultivation, but they were Four World Realm demon beasts. They were many realms of cultivation higher than him. Wasn’t he asking for a beating when he was going against bodies at the Four World Realm while his was only at the One World Realm, and they were even demon beasts too?

However, it didn’t take Sword Scroll long to think of something, and she immediately came to an understanding, “I see!”

Yang Ye planned to use intense battle to improve his body!

Outside the Primordial Pagoda.

Boom!

An explosion resounded and Yang Ye was blasted away. He spat out multiple mouthfuls of blood in midair, and it was like an absolutely gorgeous fountain of blood!

As for one of the demon beasts, Yang Ye’s tombstone had cracked its head open, but that injury didn’t really affect it!

So, the three demon beasts charged at Yang Ye once more. Meanwhile, Yang Ye crawled up from the ground and charged at them!

At the same time, three figures, two male and one female, were watching the battle from the shadows.

The man who led the group spoke abruptly, “That fellow is quite interesting. He’s a sword cultivator, but he’s using brute strength. What’s his name?”

The other man replied, “Ye Yang!”

“Ye Yang?” The woman frowned, “Ye Yang…. Yang… Yang Ye…”
