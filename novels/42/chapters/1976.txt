Chapter 1977 – Royal Crocodile!

A trap!

Yang Ye knew that the Weapon Cemetery was definitely a trap. But he wasn’t afraid.

Actually, he didn’t feel any aversion towards the middle aged man because the middle aged man had been very frank. He’d received benefits and grown stronger, but there was a price to pay.

The middle aged man had been very frank about it!

He’d been frank about it since the very beginning.

Yang Ye had chosen to take the benefits, so he had to shoulder the problems that came with it!

While Yang Ye would love to just get the benefits without the trouble, he wasn’t a person to shrink away from responsibility!

After showing the huge sword another middle finger, Yang Ye didn’t stay a moment longer, and he vanished into the boundless mountain range.

Once Yang Ye left, the middle aged man appeared once more.

He gazed in the direction Yang Ye left towards for a long time, and then he suddenly looked off into another direction. There was a ball of red light there.

“An evil treasure!” The middle aged man spoke solemnly, and his voice carried a trace of seriousness.

A voice came from within the ball of red light, “You’re quite capable since you are able to see me!”

The middle aged man asked, “You want to acknowledge him as your master?”

The voice replied with a question, “Why not?”

The middle aged man fell silent for a moment, and then he said, “Fine, I dragged him into a trap, so I’ll help him this one time!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he flicked his finger. Countless rays of cold light rained down like a storm upon the red ball of light.

Suddenly, countless red threads appeared here.

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!

In an instant, the cold light were sliced into countless pieces. At the same time, a red thread entered the middle aged man’s chest.

The middle aged man’s figure stiffened slightly. A short while passed before he looked up at the red light, “I didn’t expect you to be at such a level!”

The red light said, “I may fear you if your main body was here. As for you right now? Hmph!” The voice was filled with ridicule.

The middle aged man ignored the red light and gazed in the direction Yang Ye had left towards, “The trouble that fellow got himself into isn't ordinary at all!”

“I have a question!” Meanwhile, the red light suddenly asked, “Why do I sense an evil aura here?”

The middle aged man seemed to have thought of something, and his expression became rather unsightly.

The red light suddenly said, “Is it those 12 swords of slaughter that you spoke about?”

The middle aged man looked up at the red light, and the red light said, “Even the heavens are helping me!”

As soon as it finished speaking, it vanished into the sky.

The middle aged man stood there in silence while gloominess covered his face.

…

Yang Ye traveled swiftly through the boundless mountain range.

He didn’t choose to fly on his sword because he would become a huge target. He didn’t know what kind of powerful beasts lived in this mountain range, so it was best to keep a low profile.

Hell Mountain Range was much larger than Yang Ye had imagined because he still hadn’t gotten through it after traveling for two days.

The boundless mountain range still filled his field of vision.

Yang Ye sped up. Suddenly, a black shadow flashed over from afar.

It was huge. It stretched for over 100m in height and around 30m in width.

It was like a small hill!

Yang Ye frowned, and then he swung his sword.

A ray of light flashed, and then the black shadow was blasted away.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye saw its appearance clearly.

It was a huge demon beast. It was shaped like a tiger, but there were long spikes on its back, and it only had two legs. It was standing like a human.

The beast roared with fury at Yang Ye, but it didn’t dare to move forward.

This area was its territory!

Yang Ye understood what it meant, so he nodded slightly, “I’ll go around!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye turned and walked towards his right.

Suddenly, that demon beast leaped up and slammed its body at Yang Ye.

Yang Ye’s retreat made it think that Yang Ye was afraid.

Yang Ye understood why it attacked, so he turned around and gazed at the demon beast. After that, numerous afterimages appeared here.

The Shadow Sword!

The demon beast’s figure stiffened in midair. A moment later, countless strings of blood sprayed from it, and it was like a fountain.

It wasn’t dead!

Yang Ye was quite surprised. He hadn’t held back and struck all of its vital points, but it was still alive!

However, it was on the verge of death!

Yang Ye walked towards it with his sword in hand. This time, the demon beast was afraid, and it turned around and vanished into the forest.

Yang Ye stopped and didn’t pursue it.

He just glanced at the surroundings and planned to leave.

Suddenly!

Rumble!

The entire ground was trembling like an earthquake!

What the hell is going on?Yang Ye frowned. It didn’t take long for his expression to change. The dense forest before him was crumbling before him, and then around 50 colossi appeared in his field of vision!

Demon beasts!

They were led by the demon beast which he’d just heavily injured!

Yang Ye’s eyelids twitched from the sight of this, “So you want to gang up on me…”

Yang Ye didn’t hesitate to turn around and vanish into the distance.

Run!

He naturally had to run at a time like this. Not to mention whether he could defeat them, even if he could, it didn’t benefit him at all and would only waste his strength.

However, they had no intention to let him go, and they kept chasing after him.

So, the quiet mountain range suddenly became clamorous.

Yang Ye ran while they chased after him, and they flattened countless trees in their wake.

In the end, they stopped, and so did Yang Ye.

There was a river in front of Yang Ye. It was around 300m wide, and he could see the ends of it.

As for the demon beasts behind Yang Ye, they were glaring viciously at him!

Yang Ye glanced at them, and then he glanced at the river before him.

Something wasn’t right! Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Something was definitely off about the river!

Yang Ye didn’t go to the other side. He just sat down cross-legged, and then demon beasts just stood there and watched him from afar.

Suddenly, Zhi’er appeared by Yang Ye’s side.

Yang Ye was slightly stunned. He rubbed her head and asked, “What is it?”

She glanced at Yang Ye with a slightly strange expression in her eyes, but it only took a moment to vanish. She pointed at the river, “A familiar aura!”

A familiar aura?

Yang Ye spoke solemnly, “You’re telling me that there’s a familiar aura in the river?”

She nodded, “I’m going down!”

Yang Ye replied, “It’s dangerous!”

His intuition told him that it was very dangerous.

She gazed at him and said, “It’s fine.”

Yang Ye glanced at her, “Why do you feel a little strange?”

She blinked, “Do I?”

Yang Ye nodded slightly. He was about to speak when she suddenly said, “I really want to head down there!”

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and said, “Alright, I’ll go with you.”

She glanced at him, “Alright!”

Yang Ye took her head, but she suddenly pulled it out of his grasp. Yang Ye gazed at her, and then she grabbed his arm and said, “Let’s go!”

Yang Ye frowned slightly. He felt that there was something strange about her!

Just like that, they vanished into the river.

The demon beasts that were chasing after Yang Ye turned around and left once they witnessed this.

In the water.

Yang Ye and Zhi’er descended slowly, and nothing unusual occurred in the surroundings.

However, Yang Ye didn’t dare to relax and was vigilant at all times.

Suddenly, Zhi’er asked, “You’re nervous?”

Yang Ye gazed at her, and she grinned, “We won’t encounter any danger!”

Yang Ye fell silent for a moment, and then he said, “You feel different.”

“Am I?” She grinned, “What’s different about me?”

Yang Ye replied, “You’re not gentle and timid like before. You’re confident now!”

She smiled, “People change, right?”

Yang Ye glanced at her, “I don’t want to hurt you!”

She looked down slightly, “I don’t want to hurt you either!”

Yang Ye’s face fell. These words allowed him to realize that she really wasn’t the same Zhi’er he knew.

His right grip slowly tightened. Suddenly, Zhi’er grabbed his fist and smiled, “Don’t worry. Nothing will happen.”

They sped up.

Once they arrived at the bottom, Yang Ye noticed that it was much wider than how the river seemed from above. It seemed boundless like an ocean!

What is down here? Yang Ye was filled with questions.

Meanwhile, Zhi’er suddenly asked, “Big Brother, you’re being pursued by all the races, right?”

Yang Ye glanced at her and asked, “Why?”

She grinned, “I'll keep it a secret and tell you later.”

Yang Ye fell silent.

Around two hours later, Yang Ye noticed that the water around them had suddenly hardened.

Yang Ye flicked a ray of sword energy, but the frozen water didn’t move at all!

At this moment, a solemn expression appeared on Yang Ye’s face. Right when he was about to use the holy sword, she stopped him, “Don’t use that!”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Why?”

She grinned, “You’ll be in danger if you use it. Some people hate it to the bone, and it’s the same for me. However, I don’t mind anymore since it’s in your possession!”

Yang Ye was about to speak when she waved her right hand lightly. In an instant, the frozen water around them moved backwards.

She pointed ahead, “We’re here!”

Yang Ye looked along the direction she pointed towards. There was an extremely grand palace there, and a colossus was lying right in front of it!

Yang Ye had seen that colossus before!

It was the beast on the jade slip.

The god race’s Royal Crocodile!
