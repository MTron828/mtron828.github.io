Chapter 2228 – Why the God Race is Here!

An alliance? Yang Ye frowned, “What alliance?”

Yang Lianshuang replied, “Only the god race and us are left in the large universe. Obviously, they want to join forces against the undying race.”

She paused for a moment and continued, “It’s Zhi’er who came. She said she knows you!”

Zhi’er!

Yang Ye fell silent for a short while and said, “Let’s go meet her!”

Both of them left the pagoda once he finished speaking. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Once they left, Snowy looked around and gazed at the Primordial Pagoda, and then she started waving her claws swiftly!

Snowy seemed to have said something that made the pagoda shake violently, and it seemed very agitated.

Snowy hurriedly hugged it and started waving one of her claws.

However, it was still very agitated.

What Snowy said was very simple. She wanted to see the treasure, she wanted to see the Primordial Axe of Creation.

The Primordial Pagoda refused decisively.

But Snowy clearly seemed like she refused to give up.

At this moment, the Primordial Pagoda wanted to go to Yang Ye and tell Yang Ye to stop Snowy. Otherwise, Snowy would bring calamity upon them. However, its communication with Yang Ye was done through Snowy…

Causing trouble?

As far as Snowy was concerned, those words didn’t exist to her.

…

Outside the Primordial Pagoda. Void Spirit Hall.

Yang Ye met Zhi’er. There was an old man by her side, and he’d met the old man too. It was the old man who managed things for her, and he’d taken him to the Asura Grounds for training that day.

Yang Ye asked, “Do you need something?”

She glanced at him and said, “I’m sure you’re aware of the situation in the large universe right now. My god race and all of you can’t resist the undying race. So, I think we should join forces. In that way, we’ll still have a chance. Don’t you think so too?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “You’re mistaken. We are no match for them even if we join forces!”

She frowned slightly, “At the very least, we’ll have a chance and not be locked in such a passive position as we are right now.”

Yang Ye walked slowly to her, “Zhi’er, your god race betrayed me once. No, I should say that I once trusted your god race, but how did your god race treat me?”

Zhi’er fell silent.

In the past, their relationship was very good indeed, but the god race had no choice.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye said, “Go back to them.”

She spoke solemnly, “It’s not the time to be impulsive. Yang Ye, the undying race is far more powerful than you’ve seen. Even if my god race was at its prime, we may not be a match for it, let alone now. If we join forces and work together, then perhaps we’ll have a chance. Even if you refuse to think for your own benefit, do it for everyone else in this city!”

Yang Ye was about to say something when a voice came from outside, “Do you plan to make even more of your loved ones die?”

Yang Ye turned toward its source, and a woman in a white dress walked over slowly.

It was Ding Shaoyao.

The god race’s strategist, Ding Shaoyao!

Ding Shaoyao walked over to Yang Ye and looked him in the eyes, “Have you forgotten all who died for you?”

Suddenly, a sword pressed against her forehead.

It had stabbed in slightly, and blood seeped out!

The old man by Zhi’er’s side frowned slightly and was about to do something about it. However, a powerful aura enveloped him, causing him to be shocked and turn to its source. Elder Yuan was looking at him!

Elder Yuan was a progenitor!

So, based on their cultivations alone, Elder Yuan was at the highest realm of cultivation here!

Ding Shaoyao looked Yang Ye In the eyes, “When the undying race’s army comes next, how many by your side will die for you? I know you hate me, because I didn’t make the god race help you that day. But ask yourself this, is it really my god race’s fault that they died?”

Yang Ye fell silent for a long time before he summoned his sword back, “It was mine!”

Qin Chuan and the others’ death was his responsibility!

Ding Shaoyao said, “Yang Ye, you’re a sword cultivator who does as his heart tells him, but you must do that according to the situation. You’re not alone now, and you have friends, wives, and children to protect. If you act as you please, they will suffer the most. Since you can’t be an emotionless sword cultivator, then you cannot do as you please because you have things to worry about. Since you have things to worry about, you must be cautious when you do things and cannot do as you please. Because just a decision of yours is very likely to cause the deaths of even more. So, if you abandon them, then with the strength you possess, you can roam the world freely. Moreover, I believe that if you abandon everything, you’ll definitely become a second Unfettered One!”

Yang Ye’s natural talent was absolutely not the best.

However, his mentality was.

Natural talent wasn’t terrifying, the most terrifying was those who had a strong mind. They were more terrifying than people with extraordinary natural talent. If the mind was strong, the person would be too; if the mind wasn’t strong, even the greatest talent would be useless and vanish with time.

Those who achieved greatness since the ancient times had an impenetrable heart and mind!

As soon as she finished speaking those words, the hall fell silent.

Yang Ye fell silent too.

Just as Ding Shaoyao had said, since he planned to remain among others, then he couldn’t avoid some things of the world. Someone like the Unfettered One thought about nothing but growing stronger, so he didn’t belong to the world anymore. He had no flaws. Besides himself, he had no weak points. So, the only way to defeat him was to defeat him in head-on combat. But Yang Ye was different, Yang Ye cared about too many people and things!

It was something that Yang Lianshuang and Elder Yuan actually understood.

However, they didn’t say anything. Not that they didn’t dare to, but if they did say it, its effects wouldn’t be this good. Moreover, they didn’t want to tug at the pain in his heart.

Ding Shaoyao took another step forward and looked Yang Ye in the eyes, “Have you considered that if the undying race’s army attacks again, then only these people in this hall and those women from the Nether Pavilion can help you in battle? As for the others in the city, they can’t do anything. However, do you think that your forces can stop the undying race’s army when it comes? Or perhaps, how many of you will survive the attack? I know you’re not afraid, you’re not afraid of anyone, but do you really want all of them to die with you?”

Yang Ye didn’t answer her because he didn’t know how.

Ding Shaoyao had no intent to stop and she continued, “Yang Ye, you must realize that even if my god race has suffered decline and is inferior to the undying race, our overall strength is stronger than your side. We’re not here begging you to form an alliance with us.”

Ding Shaoyao laughed with ridicule at this point, “I know that you’re definitely thinking that you don’t need us. But Yang Ye, have you thought about how you won’t just have your friends by your side when the undying race attacks, you’ll have the experts of my god race there too. Of course, my god race won’t be alone as well, and we will have your help. So, it’s a win-win for both of us.”

Ding Shaoyao fell silent at this point, and so did the hall.

Join forces with the god race!

Just as Ding Shaoyao had said, it was a win-win situation. However, it was up to Yang Ye to decide.

Suddenly, Elder Yuan said, “Allow me to correct you. Miss Ding, I don’t think it’s right to say that Young Brother Yang dragged down his friends with him. Unless you surrender, no one can survive the undying race. So, to be frank, the reason we were able to come together and fight the undying race is Yang Ye. If it wasn’t for him, our alliance wouldn’t exist at all. Besides that, a mysterious expert stopped the undying race earlier, and if I’m not wrong, it was due to Yang Ye too!”

Elder Yuan paused for a moment and continued, “Of course, an alliance with the god race is beneficial to us all. As for what you said about the god race’s strength being superior, I don’t agree with that. Let me ask you something, does your patriarch, Shi Tian, have absolute confidence in being able to kill Yang Ye? Of course, Yang Ye can’t defeat him either. But what if Miss An is included?”

An Nanjing!

Ding Shaoyao’s eyes narrowed slightly. Besides Yang Ye, there was another extraordinary genius on Yang Ye’s side, and it was An Nanjing!

It really wasn’t difficult for them to kill progenitors with their current strength!

Meanwhile, Elder Yuan added, “Miss Ding, working together is a win-win for us, but you must realize that just like your god race doesn’t need to beg us, we don’t need to beg you either. Our status is equal, and it’s not one side helping the other. Right?”

Ding Shaoyao glanced at Elder Yuan and said, “I think making a fuss about these things is meaningless at a time like this, right?”

Elder Yuan smiled, “If the god race doesn’t, then we won’t.”

He gazed at Yang Ye and continued, “Young Brother Yang, the decision is yours!”

Yang Ye fell silent for a long time and said, “While we can’t be friends with the god race, it doesn’t stop us from forming an alliance!”

Just as Ding Shaoyao had said, he really had to think for the people by his side. If he was all alone, he wouldn’t fear death at all. If he was no match for his enemies, he could just run! So long as he wanted, he was certain that the undying race couldn’t catch up to him. After all, if the undying cavalry tried to chase him, then his strength was sufficient to slowly kill them one by one!

But besides An Nanjing and himself, everyone else he knew couldn’t accomplish that!

Moreover, he’d promised Tian Xiu to take care of Void Spirit Continent for her!

He had to wait for her to return!

Ding Shaoyao gazed at Yang Ye for a long time before she said, “Bring An Nanjing and come to the God Realm with me. It’s beneficial for both of you!”

She turned around and left the hall.

Once she walked outside, Ding Shaoyao closed her eyes slowly. At this moment, only what Yang Ye said earlier remained in her mind… He couldn’t become friends with the god race…
