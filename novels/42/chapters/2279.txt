Chapter 2280 – They’re Inferior, So Why Learn?

The man looked familiar!

Meanwhile, the man was staring at Yang Ye with an undisguised desire to kill.

Exalt Yun suddenly shouted with fury, “Jian Yuan, stand down!”

The man called Jian Yuan spoke solemnly, “Exalt Yun, how can I not avenge my brother?”

Brother?

Yang Ye was stunned. He sized up Jian Yuan, “No wonder you looked familiar. So you’re Jian Kan’s younger brother. I’m truly surprised. Both of you aren’t from the same sect!”

“Yang Ye!” Jian Yuan howled with fury, “You killed my brother, I…”

“He wanted to kill me!” Yang Ye spoke indifferently, “Understand?”

Jian Yuan stared at Yang Ye, “All I do know is that he’s dead and you’re alive.”

As soon as he finished speaking, powerful sword intent surged out incessantly from within him.

Yang Ye thought for a moment and said, “I couldn’t just let him kill me, right? Strictly speaking, it was self-defense. Don’t you think so too?”

He gazed at Exalt Yun and continued, “What do you think?”

Exalt Yun glanced at Yang Ye and remained silent.

“Yang Ye!” Meanwhile, Jian Yuan suddenly spoke ferociously, “I don’t care about that. All I know is that he died at your hands, so pay with your life! You…”

Meanwhile, a sword howl resounded.

Hiss!

Yang Ye’s figure transformed into a thread that vanished on the spot. At the instant he vanished, Exalt Yun’s expression changed drastically, and he tapped his finger forward, causing a ray of sword energy to shoot out from it.

At the same time, Jian Yuan drew his sword and swung it!

Hiss!

A sound of something tearing resounded, and then the surroundings fell silent.

At this moment, Yang Ye was behind Jian Yuan.

Exalt Yun’s eyes opened wide and were filled with disbelief. Meanwhile, Jian Yuan’s body had stiffened on the spot, and there was a thumb-sized hole on his forehead.

Jian Yuan seemed like he’d lost his soul and muttered softly, “I-Impossible…”

Suddenly, Yang Ye swung a backhanded slash.

Swoosh!

Jian Yuan’s head shot up into the air while accompanied by a pillar of blood.

Yang Ye turned around and gazed at Exalt Yun, “I’m usually willing to try reasoning with people. Unfortunately, it’s useless. Now, I think my fists and sword are reason itself. Not only are they reason, they are the truth. As my fists and sword grew stronger, so does the reason I possess. What do you think?”

Exalt Yun gazed at Yang Ye for a long time and said, “If you’re strong, it’s definitely you who is right!”

Yang Ye smiled and walked over to Exalt Yun, “Actually, you could have stopped him, but you didn’t. If I’m not wrong, you probably wanted to see my true strength. Are you satisfied now?”

Exalt Yun gazed at Yang Ye in silence.

Yang Ye shrugged, “Lead the way!”

Exalt Yun fell silent for a while and left.

Yang Ye immediately followed him. A short while later, they arrived at the peak of Sky Sword Peak. As soon as he arrived there, Yang Ye sensed a strand of extremely powerful sword intent!

It gave him a huge amount of pressure!

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings and took in the scene here. There was a single ancient hall here, and a bamboo forest covered the surroundings.

It was extremely quiet because there were very few here. Besides Exalt Yun, he didn’t see anyone else.

Meanwhile, Exalt Yun said, “This is the main peak of my Sword Sky City, and most people aren’t able to come here. Please come with me!”

Exalt Yun led Yang Ye into the hall. As soon as they did, a wave of sharp sword intent assaulted Yang Ye, causing him to frown slightly. He waved his right hand, and it instantly vanished.

Exalt Yun glanced at Yang Ye, “Your sword intent…”

Yang Ye made it simple, “I used Intent Ignition!”

Intent Ignition!

Exalt Yun was stunned and said, “In other words, you can’t use sword intent at all right now?”

Yang Ye nodded, “Sort of.”

Exalt Yun frowned, “You can’t use sword intent, yet your sword is so powerful… How can that be…?”

“Can we get down to business?” Yang Ye said, “I’m in a hurry.”

Exalt Yun glanced at Yang Ye and said, “Please come with me!”

He left Yang Ye deep into the hall, and it didn’t take long for them to arrive at their destination. In a secret chamber that wasn’t very large yet not very small either, countless different swords floated here.

They were all ordinary swords, but every one of them contained a strand of special energy.

“2,329 swords that represent 2,329 Sword Daos!” Meanwhile, Exalt Yun continued, “They are from different sword cultivators. While there’s a difference in their strength, their styles vary. Every Sword Dao has its weak points and strong points. Only those at the Progenitor Realm who possess their own Sword Dao can study here.”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Why?”

Exalt Yun said, “If your cultivation is insufficient, and you don’t have your own Sword Dao, you will fall into a dilemma here. You will be restrained and trapped by the Sword Dao’s of others. In that way, it would be even more difficult to create your own Sword Dao. Thus, only those who fulfill those requirements can enter here, leave their Sword Daos behind, and study the Sword Daos of others to make up for their weak points.”

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings and nodded, “Needless to say, Sword Sky City is extraordinary.”

“Of course!” Exalt Yun continued, “If it’s in terms of the Sword Dao alone, then besides the Sword Ruins, my Sword Sky City is the strongest in Eternal Border!”

Yang Ye gazed at Exalt Yun, “Sword Ruins?”

Exalt Yun replied softly, “An ancient place that you may be able to visit in the future.”

He gestured with a finger, and a sword floated over to Yang Ye, “Leave your Sword Dao within it and you can study the other Sword Daos here.”

Yang Ye gazed at the sword before him, fell silent for a moment, and then grabbed it. In an instant, it started trembling, and then it gradually started turning red. In just a short while, it had turned blood red like it was made from blood!

A long time passed before Yang Ye withdrew his grasp, and the sword immediately shook while a wave of powerful slaughter intent rippled out from it. In an instant, all the other swords moved aside, and none dared to get close to Yang Ye’s sword!

“The Slaughter Sword Dao!” Exalt Yun spoke solemnly, “Such dense slaughter intent, such a powerful desire to kill. A tool of slaughter… I’ve never seen such a Sword Dao.”

Yang Ye remained silent.

The Slaughter Sword Dao?

Actually, only two people knew that Yang Ye’s Sword Dao wasn’t the Slaughter Sword Dao. Yang Ye’s true Sword Dao was the Sword Dao of Emotion. His core was emotion. His slaughter intent came from his emotions. The more he felt, the greater it was, and that was why Yang Ye wasn’t enslaved by his desire to kill, and he’d enslaved it instead. Strictly speaking, he was enslaved by emotion! And he willingly allowed it to do so!

Of course, if Yang Ye was willing to sever his emotions and remove the shackles on his sword, then he would become even stronger too. Just like this very moment, if he could abandon An Nanjing, Su Qingshi and the others, Qin Chuan and the others’ families, and Sky Maiden’s group, then the Shiyuan Clan and any other power would be helpless against him. His heart would be completely free!

What kind of sword cultivator was the most terrifying? Those without any shackles like the Unfettered one.

However, if he did that, he would become a second Unfettered One.

He didn’t kill for eternal life or personal interests, he killed to survive and to keep his loved ones safe.

Exalt Yun took a deep and long glance at the sword Yang Ye left behind. At this moment, no other sword dared to approach it. The other swords here merely emanated sword intent, but this one was very strange because it emanated both sword intent and slaughter intent!

A short while later, Exalt Yun gazed at Yang Ye, “Please do as you wish now!”

Yang Ye shook his head, “Take me to the scroll!”

“Why?” Exalt Yun was puzzled, “Aren’t you going to study these Sword Daos?”

Yang Ye glanced at them and said, “No.”

Exalt Yun asked, “Why?”

Yang Ye smiled, “Must you insist?”

Exalt Yun nodded.

Yang Ye glanced at them and said, “They’re inferior, so why learn?”

The surroundings instantly fell perfectly silent.

But just a moment later, the 2,000 plus swords here started trembling, and then they pointed themselves at Yang Ye while numerous powerful wills in the Sword Dao slammed down at Yang Ye.

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly, and then he flipped his palm. A sword appeared in his grasp. A moment later, he pointed it at an angle to the ground while powerful slaughter intent rippled out. In an instant, the entire room was filled with monstrous slaughter intent. At the same time, a wave of mysterious energy appeared here.

The Sword Domain!

At the instant his Sword Domain appeared, the wills of those Sword Daos immediately collapsed and countless swords fell to the ground.

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings and spoke indifferently, “I’m not looking down on all of you. Your Sword Daos are extremely powerful, but mine is stronger!”

The swords remained silent.

Exalt Yun took a deep and long glance at Yang Ye. His lips moved with the intent to say something, but when he thought of the scene he just witnessed, he immediately swallowed those words. He laughed bitterly, “I admire your confidence.” Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Yang Ye put his sword away, “Take me to the scroll.”

Exalt Yun nodded and led Yang Ye out of the hall. A short while later, they arrived before a hall. At the center of it was the statue of a middle aged man. The middle aged man seemed imposing, and there was ghastly slaughter intent between his brows.

There was a sword in his left grasp, and a scroll in his right. There were three words inscribed on it—Limitless Sword Scroll. The scroll wasn’t a part of the statue.

Exalt Yun bowed respectfully to the statue, and then gazed at Yang Ye. Yang Ye walked over to it and looked at the scroll.

As he gazed at it, his eyes suddenly turned blood red, and a woman in a red dress danced within his eyes.

“The Slaughter Sword Dao?” A voice resounded in Yang Ye’s mind, “It’s wrong. Your Sword Dao is absolutely wrong. Only by killing people, the heart, the father, the mother, the loved ones, and all things can it be truly considered as the Slaughter Sword Dao!”
