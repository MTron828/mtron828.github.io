Chapter 1871 – The Dao Progenitor!

His sword entered the Dao!

Yang Ye spoke solemnly, “Senior, you mean that sword outside… He broke it himself?”

The Devil Progenitor nodded, ‘Yes.”

Yang Ye fell silent. In the past, the Unfettered One had no ties, and only the sword resided in his heart. Yet now, he’d even abandoned his sword. What did that represent? It represented that there were no ties left in his heart.

Meanwhile, the Devil Progenitor said, “Giving it up doesn’t represent giving up the Sword Dao, and it’s giving up the obsession in his heart. He put down the obsession he had, the sword. So, his Sword Dao attained the limits of the Emotionless Sword Dao, perfection!”

The Emotionless Sword Dao! Yang Ye asked, “Senior, I heard his Sword Dao had a flaw. What was it?”

“A flaw?” The Devil Progenitor said, “It does. If he can mend that flaw…” The Devil Progenitor’s voice became quite solemn, “Then he’d be quite terrifying. Actually, he’s already extremely terrifying now..”

The Devil Progenitor suddenly gazed at Yang Ye at this point, “Kid, your attainments in the Sword Dao are extraordinary too. Do you know why?”

Yang Ye shook his head.

The Devil Progenitor explained, “Your character. Most times, it’s a person’s character that decides the person’s fate. Your character is suited to the Sword Dao. The sword is something that would rather break than bend, and it’s a weapon to kill. The sword never surrenders… Your character just happens to suit it perfectly.” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Yang Ye asked, “Senior, what are you trying to say?”

The Devil Progenitor explained, “You’re learned a lot of different things. Of course, it’s beneficial too. However, you must never forget your roots and leave in pursuit of something else! The Sword Dao is your foundation. Regardless of whether you cultivate techniques of the shaman race or devil cultivation, they can only be auxiliary techniques that support your Sword Dao. Understand?”

Yang Ye nodded. He naturally knew that very well. The Sword Dao was his foundation. Even though he was very strong right now, he would only be comparable to an ordinary Quasi Enlightened Realm expert if he didn’t use his sword!

But if he used his sword, he could even kill a Heavenly Exalt!

Suddenly, the Devil Progenitor added, “Learning a vast variety of things is beneficial too. Because even grandmasters converge and consolidate the benefits or advantages of others before creating a new sect or way of cultivation. If you want to improve yourself, learning more things is beneficial too. However, you have to know your own limits. After all, you can’t chew with your mouth full.”

Yang Ye cupped his fist, “Thank you for the guidance!”

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and continued, “There’s something else I don’t understand. Senior, what are you doing here?”

The Devil Progenitor smiled, “I was trying to take refuge here. But it seems like I’ve failed.”

Yang Ye was quite puzzled. He wanted to ask more, but the Devil Progenitor waves his hand, “Go on.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he closed his eyes.

Yang Ye glanced at the Devil Progenitor and left.

Once Yang Ye left, the Devil Progenitor opened his eyes. He looked towards the exit for a long time and said, “The battle between paths of cultivation… It’s coming that quickly?”

…

After he left the hall, Yang Ye stood before the door, and the broken sword was by the door. He walked over to the sword, and then his gaze suddenly fell to the hilt of the sword. There were two small words there—A’Qing!

A’Qing? Yang Ye frowned.

A short while later, Yang Ye turned around and walked away. Suddenly, the pieces of the sword trembled, and then they flew over to Yang Ye.

Yang Ye was stunned.

After that, he spoke in a low voice, “What do you want?”

The pieces of the sword trembled lightly and seemed to be explaining something.

Yang Ye shook his head, “You’re not my sword. I don’t want to take you.”

The sword trembled even more violently when it heard Yang Ye.

However, Yang Ye turned around and walked away. He had no doubt that it was a very good sword, but it wasn’t his sword. Suddenly, the Devil Progenitor’s voice resounded in Yang Ye’s ears, “It doesn’t want to stay with you, it just wants to go with you.”

Yang Ye stopped, “What do you mean?”

The Devil Progenitor replied, “It wants to go look for its past owner. But it’s very well aware that it’s unable to do so on its own. So, it wants your help.”

Yang Ye fell silent.

Meanwhile, the Devil Progenitor spoke again, “His Sword Dao is emotionless, but his sword has emotion. Take it with you. Perhaps it may be of help to you one day!”

Yang Ye thought for a moment, and then he waved his hand and placed it within the Primordial Pagoda.

Yang Ye didn’t stay a moment longer and left the underground palace.

Above the river, Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings and heaved a sigh of relief.

He’d escaped unscathed this time. If the Devil Progenitor had really intended to harm him, then his current strength wouldn’t have been sufficient to protect himself at all. But Yang Ye was quite puzzled about why the Devil Progenitor hadn’t killed him.

Yang Ye fell silent for a long time, and then he transformed into a ray of light that vanished into the distance.

He didn’t leave immediately because he hadn’t forgotten about the Xenosprites here. Those Xenosprites had Sprite Cores within them, and those cores were extremely helpful to him. Not only were they helpful to him; they were absolutely helpful to An Nanjing, Nether Maiden, and the others!

Hunt the Xenosprites!

The strongest aspect about them was the black light they released. However, that black light was useless against Yang Ye. So, it only took him two days to gather almost 30 Sprite Cores!

However, that was far from enough!

Ten days later, Yang Ye stopped.

He had around 70 Sprite Cores now! He actually didn’t want to stop so soon, but he had to. Because the Xenosprites ran as soon as they saw him now, and they refused to fight him.

Even though he could chase them down, it wasted too much time. So, he’d decided to stop and charge into the 6th stage of the True Realm!

Yang Ye found a safe place and entered the Primordial Pagoda.

In the cultivation room, Yang Ye sat down cross-legged and withdrew ten Sprite Cores. He didn’t consume them at once, and he just swallowed one. It didn’t take long for a strand of pure energy to spread through him!

The 6th stage of the True Realm!

Yang Ye started cultivating like a madman. He was at the 5th stage of the True Realm now. So long as he advanced into the 6th stage, his strength would undergo a huge transformation, and he would improve in every other aspect as well.

Two weeks later, an aura gradually started to seep out from Yang Ye, and it was growing stronger and stronger as time passed. At this moment, he’d finished absorbing the 9th Sprite Core. Suddenly, he opened his mouth, and the last Sprite Core before him floated into his mouth.

The tiny vortex within him was spinning madly, and the aura he emanated was growing stronger and stronger…

Three days later.

Boom!

The cultivation room suddenly shook violently, but it didn’t take long for it to return to calm.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye slowly opened his eyes.

The 6th stage of the True Realm!

With the help of those 10 Sprite Cores, he’d finally advanced to the 6th stage of the True Realm. At this moment, he felt like his body… No, every aspect including his spirit and soul had undergone a tremendous transformation!

Suddenly, Hou Qing appeared by Yang Ye’s side, “Congratulations!”

Yang Ye took a deep breath and said, “There’s nothing to congratulate. My strength has merely improved slightly, and it hasn’t undergone a qualitative transformation. So, I’m quite inferior when compared to those old freaks from the ancient times!”

Hou Qing said, “But you’re truly a genius to have attained such strength at your age.”

Yang Ye smiled. He seemed to have thought of something, and he restrained his smile. He spoke seriously, “Senior, do you know the Devil Progenitor I met that day?”

Hou Qing shook his head.

Yang Ye frowned slightly, “You don’t?”

Hou Qing replied, “He may be from the same era as my Shaman King.”

Yang Ye asked, “Your Shaman King?”

Hou Qing nodded, “We call him the Shaman King, but you humans call him the Shaman Progenitor.”

Yang Ye asked, “What about my master?”

Hou Qing glanced at Yang Ye, “The Dao Progenitor.”

Yang Ye hurriedly asked, “How strong is he?”

Hou Qing shook his head, “You’ll find out in the future!”

He vanished on the spot once he finished speaking.

Yang Ye shrugged, and then he vanished too.

After chatting with Little Sky in the Primordial Pagoda for some time, Yang Ye left the Primordial Pagoda before swiftly leaving the 10th level of Heaven Pillar Mountain.

After that, he went to see Yang Lianshuang and the others.

In the hall. Yang Lianshuang and all the others were here.

Yang Lianshuang asked, “Why did you gather us here?”

Yang Ye waved his right hand, and the Sprite Cores within the Primordial Pagoda appeared before him.

All of them were stunned by the sight of the Sprite Cores.

An Nanjing asked, “What are these?”

“Sprite Cores!” It was Yang Lianshuang who answered her.

All of them gazed at her, and even Yang Ye gazed at her, “You recognize them?”

Yang Lianshuang nodded, “They are extremely precious, and they are treasures used by Quasi Enlightened Realm experts to improve their strength. How did you get so many?”

Yang Ye smiled, “It’s a long store. I’ll tell all of you when we have more time!”

Yang Lianshuang spoke solemnly, “Can you get more for us? Around 50 of them!”

Yang Ye asked, “Why?”

Yang Lianshuang said, “If we have around 50 more, all of us should be able to attain the 6th stage of the True Realm. At that time, even Heavenly Exalts would be ants before our joint forces!”

Even Heavenly Exalts would be ants!
