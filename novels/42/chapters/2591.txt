Chapter 2592

Qi Bitian put the box away and said, “The other two pieces!”

The voice replied, “We obtained it deep beneath the Boundless Water. Even I do not know where the other two pieces are.”

Qi Bitian didn’t say anything and just left with the box.

Once she left, the man heaved a sigh of relief and hurriedly asked, “Abode Master, who was that?”

A moment of silence ensued, and then the voice resounded, “Someone who doesn’t belong to this era.”

The man wanted to ask more, but the owner of the voice had vanished.

Yang Ye returned to the bridge and continued forward!

He didn’t plan to waste more time here because he’d met the Desolate Emperor, and the latter had told him that the war was about to begin.

He had to rush back to the Ancient Sword Sect as soon as possible, and then make arrangements for the future!

Of course, he’d already planned everything!

If it was possible, he planned to stab a huge hold in the Soul Sect and Eternal Kingdom’s back!

Yang Ye sped up.

Around an hour later, Yang Ye stopped. There was a floating platform to the right of him, and there was a teleportation formation on it.

Yang Ye was delighted because he knew it should be the way out.

Yang Ye hurried over there, but an old man suddenly appeared before him.

The old man glanced at Yang Ye, and Yang Ye flicked a spatial ring over to the old man. The old man glanced at it, and then he vanished with the spatial ring.

Yang Ye appeared on the platform.

A moment later, the formation started up.

Yang Ye’s figure gradually turned ethereal. However, a ray of light suddenly shot over from the end of the bridge, and then Yang Ye’s expression changed drastically. He left the platform and returned to the bridge.

Yang Ye looked over, and he saw a black clothed figure shooting over in his direction!

Yang Ye’s face turned icy cold!

It was an expert of the Soul Sect!

The black robed man wasn’t an unfamiliar face because it was one of the two Soul Sect’s experts who’d hunted him in the past. Both of them had been at the peak of the grade 2 Lord Realm. But one of them had been killed by the Ancient Sword Sect’s founding ancestor that day, so only one of them remained.

Yang Ye hadn’t expected the Soul Sect to hunt him all the way here!

The black robed man was covered in souls when he arrived before Yang Ye.

Yang Ye made a forward grasping motion, and an intent sword appeared in his grasp. A moment later, he stabbed it forward.

A very simple stab!

However, it was such a simple stab that caused the black robed man’s expression to change drastically!

It wasn’t very powerful, but it was just right. Actually, it was like how it was when a grandmaster sparred with a new student. It may be the same punch, but it would be absolutely different when executed by the grandmaster.

The black robed man’s impression of Yang Ye was still stuck at when they last met in Eternal Kingdom. So, at this moment, he was shocked when Yang Ye used an attack that was completely different than before!

Yang Ye’s sword stabbed forward!

Hiss!

The souls that arrived first were instantly obliterated, and then Yang Ye waved his sword lightly.

Hiss!

A ray of sword energy rippled out in the form of a crescent, slicing apart all the souls in its path!

The black robed man retreated over 300m back and created space between him and Yang Ye! FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Meanwhile, Yang Ye stood there with his sword in hand.

Returning to simplicity?

No!

Yang Ye’s attacks weren’t a return to simplicity, it had just shed off the unnecessary to seek its true form. In the past, his sword carried many, many external aspects and things he relied upon. After all, he used to possess countless divine treasures!

Yet now, he was just swinging a sword!

The black robed man sized up Yang Ye and said, “You’ve really changed in this short amount of time!”

Yang Ye didn’t waste his breath and just took a step forward. He instantly appeared before the black robed man, and then his sword shot forward like a flash of lightning.

The black robed man didn’t dare to act carelessly. He pressed his palms together, and countless souls rippled out from him.

Bang!

The powerful souls weren’t able to push Yang Ye back, and with a light wave of his sword, rays of sword energy rippled out from it and instantly sliced the souls into bits. Shrill cries resounded in the air above the bridge.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye took a quick stride forward, and then his sword turned ethereal.

The Sword Domain!

Domain Sword!

His sword shot forward.

Bang!

The souls around the black robed man let out shrill and miserable cries, and then the man’s black robe exploded apart. Countless souls exploded apart with it.

Bang!

A sword stabbed into the black robed man’s chest, and the powerful force within it blasted him over 3km away.

The man supported himself against the bridge’s railing. At this moment, he’d lost his black robe, and it revealed his figure, a middle aged man. The sword in his chest was still there, and blood was ceaselessly seeping out of the injury.

The sword had a Domain of its own. He’d tried his best, but he still hadn’t been able to stop the sword.

“Cough!” The middle aged man wiped off the blood on the corner of his mouth and looked up at Yang Ye, “You’re different.”

He suddenly pulled out Yang Ye’s sword, and then his body exploded apart. At the same time, a wave of terrifying Soul Energy swept at Yang Ye like an erupting volcano!

Self-detonation!

Moreover, he’d detonated his own soul!

Live?

The middle aged man knew very well that surviving was impossible. Yang Ye wasn’t the same anymore, so fleeing wasn’t realistic at all. So, he’d chosen to die with Yang Ye.

The self-detonation of a grade 2 Lord Realm expert was absolutely powerful!

Yang Ye didn’t dare act carelessly. He took a step back and raised both hands, and then an intent sword condensed into form. The sword turned ethereal, and then he swung it!

Hiss!

The terrifying Soul Energy was instantly sliced apart, and it rippled off into the surroundings. However, it vanished without a trace upon coming into contact with the Boundless Water.

The Soul Energy may have been powerful, but it was nothing before the Boundless Water!

A short while later, the Soul Energy’s aftershock gradually vanished.

Yang Ye relaxed his grip, and the intent sword vanished.

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings, and then he walked toward the teleportation formation. However, an old man obstructed his path, the old man from before.

Yang Ye glanced at the old man, “What is it?”

The old man replied indifferently, “You can’t leave!”

Yang Ye frowned slightly, “Why?”

The old man shook his head, “Someone outside doesn’t want you out of here, and they’ve paid a price we cannot refuse. So, you can’t leave. Of course, we won’t act against you as well.”

Someone outside!

Yang Ye chuckled, “The Soul Sect? Eternal Kingdom? No, they’ve always been one and the same.”

The old man replied indifferently, “I don’t know. My mission is to stop you from leaving.”

Yang Ye looked the old man in the eyes, “What if I insist on leaving?”

The old man replied, “You can try.”

Yang Ye was about to attack when a voice came from nearby, “Young Brother Yang!”

Yang Ye looked over and saw the Ascetic.

The Ascetic appeared before him and smiled, “I didn’t expect to see you here. I just happen to have something to discuss with you. How about we speak somewhere else?”

Yang Ye Hesitated for a moment and nodded. They turned around and left.

The old man glanced at Yang Ye and remained silent.

Once they were far away from the teleportation platform, the Ascetic sighed softly, “Don’t be rash!”

Yang Ye asked, “Why?”

The Ascetic shook his head slightly, “You know nothing about them! Just think about it, if they were able to establish a teleportation formation here, would they be ordinary? It’s a formation linked to the outside world, and the difficulty to do that is beyond your imagination. If you attacked, it would be equivalent to giving them an excuse to attack you.”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “They can’t attack at will?”

The Ascetic nodded, “They can’t attack rashly on the bridge because they are a local power here, so there are some rules here that bind them!”

Yang Ye spoke solemnly, “Madam Yin attacked me previously!”

The Ascetic laughed bitterly, “Firstly, she isn’t a local, so she doesn’t have to follow some rules. Secondly, let me be a little direct. She’s the wife of the Yin Lord, an extraordinary expert, but you are nothing in the eyes of some people. So, when Madam Yin attacked you, they merely closed an eye to it. Moreover, she didn’t kill you.”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and nodded, “I see.”

Rule?

The rules treated people differently.

Yang Ye didn’t know that the reason that mysterious expert had spoken angrily upon witnessing Madam Yin’s death at Qi Bitian’s hands, was for this exact reason.

Yang Ye spoke solemnly, “I must leave as soon as possible. I’m afraid they’ll attack my sect!”

He gazed at the Ascetic, “Do you have any ideas?”

The Ascetic fell silent for a short while and said, “You have three paths. Firstly, kill your way out. It’s the simplest and most direct. Of course, I don’t think you have the strength for that. The second is to make them let you out by offering them something they cannot refuse. For example, a Super Divine Treasure. Of course, I don’t think you’ll do that!”

Yang Ye asked, “What about the third?”

The Ascetic laughed bitterly, “It’s the most difficult. Complain about them or cause trouble. Whether this succeeds depends on the strength of your backing. Because trying to complain and cause trouble may end with them killing you.”

Yang Ye fell silent for a moment and said, “I’ll complain first, if that fails, I’ll cause trouble. If all of that fails, I’ll kill my way out.”

He took a deep breath and said, “So all of you want to act against me? Fine! It’s time my slaughter intent improved!”
