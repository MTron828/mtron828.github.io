Chapter 1948 – Wait Until I Return!

They’re here!

Yang Ye was about to say something when the space around them suddenly trembled, and then three old men and a middle aged man appeared there.

The experts of the shaman race!

Yang Ye’s face fell.

Yin Hou’s gaze descended upon the old man who stood not too far away from her, “Yu Gao, what’s the meaning of this?”

The old man, Yu Gao, gazed at Yang Ye, “Yin Hou, you should be aware of how disadvantageous it would be to us if that sword falls into the hands of the Sovereign of Man.”

Yin Hou chuckled, “Yu Gao, then let me be frank. I owe him a debt, and it’s he who brought me back to the Shaman Dimension. So, I won’t let anything happen to him in the Shaman Dimension. Understand?”

Yu Gao spoke in a low voice, “Yin Hou, you intend to disregard the shaman race’s safety for a human?”

“The shaman race’s safety?” Yin Hou laughed with ridicule, “Are you joking? A sword is related to the safety of our shaman race? If that’s true, our shaman race is absolutely weak.” She glanced coldly at them and continued, “I’ll be frank. If you intend to take it by force, then I’ll fight with all of you to the death!”

Yu Gao and the others’ expressions became extremely unsightly.

Meanwhile, an old man suddenly spoke solemnly, “Yin Hou, you actually intend to go against us for a human?”

Yin Hou gazed at the old man, “I brought him to the Shaman Dimension, so I’m responsible for his safety. I’m definitely unable to stop your joint forces today, but trust me… In the days that come, the only thing that I, Yin Hou, will do is take revenge on all of you! No matter the cost!”

“You’ve really gone mad!” Yu Gao spoke in a low voice, “Yin Hou, if that sword falls into our shaman race’s possession, it won’t just greatly weaken the Sovereign of Man, it’ll allow our shaman race to hold the initiative. That’s extremely beneficial to our race. Yet you are actually planning to act willfully. You…”

Suddenly, a middle aged man said, “Let’s capture him first!”

He was about to attack once he finished speaking.

“Stop!” However, a voice suddenly came from afar.

Everyone looked over, and they saw a young man there.

Yang Ye recognized him, it was Li Jiang.

Yu Gao and the others frowned when they saw Li Jiang. A prince was nothing to them.

Li Jiang glanced at them, clenched his fists, and said, “Seniors, my father has ordered to let him leave!”

As he spoke, he flipped his palm, and a golden command token appeared there.

The Shaman Emperor Token!

Yu Gao and the others’ frowns deepened!

One of the old men suddenly asked, “Why has the Shaman Emperor changed his orders?”

Li Jiang shook his head slightly, “I don’t know. But my father said he knows what he’s doing! Moreover, he wants all of you to go see him immediately. There’s something important that he wants to discuss with all of you. Right, Lady Yin Hou, you have to go too!”

Something important to discuss!

Yu Gao and the others exchanged glances, and they were quite puzzled.

Yin Hou flicked a ray of white light into Yang Ye’s forehead, “That’s the path to the Dead Dimension. Go there yourself. Be careful. Go right now!”

Yang Ye cupped his fist to her, “Farewell!”

He was about to leave when Li Jiang suddenly said, “Brother Yang, take care!”

Yang Ye glanced at Li Jiang, and then he nodded slightly, “Thanks!”

Yang Ye twisted his right foot against the ground, and then a ray of light flashed before he vanished into the sky.

…

Shaman Emperor Palace.

A middle aged man in a golden robe sat on the throne, he was the shaman race’s Shaman Emperor. Yu Gao, Yin Hou, and the others were down below.

At this moment, Li Jiang was there too, but he was kneeling.

Yu Gao and the others had quite gloomy expressions on their faces.

The Shaman Emperor stood up, walked slowly towards Li Jiang, and said, “I gave you my command token to tell Yin Hou that she should prioritize our entire race’s interests, and that she must get that sword. But what did you do?”

Li Jiang remained on his knees and stayed silent.

The Shaman Emperor asked, “Am I wrong?”

Li jiang shook his head.

The Shaman Emperor shouted, “Reason!”

Li Jiang looked into the Shaman Emperor’s eyes, “Father, if it wasn’t for Yang Ye, I would have brought shame to our shaman race in the Sky Dimension. At that time, taking my own life would be the only way to atone for my sins. It can be said that Yang Ye saved my life. You always say that we should repay the debts we owe, right?”

“Nonsense!” Suddenly, Yu Gao roared with fury, “That depends on the circumstances! Your own debt is nothing compared to the safety of the entire shaman race!”

Li Jiang gazed at Yu Gao, “Lord Yu Gao, has Yang Ye become a threat to our shaman race?”

Yu Gao was speechless.

Meanwhile, the other old man suddenly said, “While he has no ill intent to our shaman race, he’s still a human.”

Li Jiang said, “He has the bloodline of the shaman race, and has cultivated our techniques too!”

The old man frowned.

Meanwhile, the Shaman Emperor berated, “Watch how you speak!”

Li Jiang nodded slightly and fell silent.

Meanwhile, Yin Hou stepped forward, “All of you only see the short-term benefits of everything, but you haven’t taken a look at the danger that’s lurking here. Allow me to ask you something, what do you think about Yang Ye?”

Yang Ye!

Everyone gazed at Yin Hou.

Yin Hou continued, “He can kill 3rd stage Enlightened Realm experts and even 4th stage Enlightened Realm experts while still at the 6th stage of the True Realm. How terrifying is his natural talent?”

Yu Gao spoke indifferently, “Are you trying to say that he can pose a threat to our shaman race?”

“Of course not right now!” Yin Hou continued, “However, what about in the future? If he doesn’t die young, he’ll definitely become an extraordinary expert.”

“I think that sword poses a greater threat!” Yu Gao gazed at the Shaman Emperor, “If we use our shaman race’s divine beast, we’ll definitely be able to stop him. We still have a chance!”

The Shaman Emperor remained silent.

Meanwhile, Yin Hou’s face turned gloomy.

Suddenly, a voice resounded through the hall, “He shoulders great karma. My shaman race will not become friends with him, but don’t become enemies with him either!”

Everyone in the hall shuddered when they heard the voice, and then all of them bowed and nodded, “Understood!”

…

In a small village far away in the Southern Unicorn Prefecture. The village was old, run-down, and extremely inconspicuous.

On this day, a middle aged man with a spear on his back suddenly arrived in the village.

The middle aged man went to a run-down house, and an old man walked out from within.

The middle aged man asked, “Where’s Master?”

The old man shook his head slightly, “I don’t know!”

The middle aged man frowned.

The old man said, “All I do know is that she left with a human youth. As for the reason, I didn’t dare to ask.”

“A human?” The middle aged man’s frown deepened.

The middle aged man asked, “How much of her memories have returned?” Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

The old man shook his head slightly, “Less than 20%. Perhaps a little more by now.”

The middle aged man asked, “Who’s the human?”

The old man fell silent for a long time before he replied, “He has Emperor Xuanyuan’s sword!”

Fear flashed through the middle aged man’s eyes, “Didn’t the Sovereign of Man have that sword?”

The old man shook his head slightly, “I don’t know. However, its sword spirit shows signs of awakening.”

The old man took a deep breath at this point and looked up into the sky, “All those years ago, Lord Shi Tian sacrificed himself to heavily injure that sword and force the other races to retreat. Yet now, its sword spirit is showing signs of awakening…”

Undisguised worry appeared in both their eyes at this point.

Suddenly, a woman in a white dress walked over slowly from afar.

She seemed quite weak and delicate.

The middle aged man and old man gazed at her, and then the middle aged man’s brows gradually formed a frown, “Who’re you?”

The woman waved her hand slightly. In an instant, an expanse of stars appeared below their feet!

Stars!

At this moment, it was like they were in the starry sky.

The area beneath their feet seemed like a huge chessboard of stars, and the stars were the pieces.

The middle aged man’s voice trembled as he said, “The heavens become the board, and the stars are the pieces. The world is changed into a world of stars. You’re the Strategist!”

The woman closed her eyes, “The cycle of reincarnation is endless. This is the final time. The human race, shaman race, devil race, demon race, sky race… It’s time to repay this debt of blood!”

…

Yang Ye shot through the clouds on his sword.

The Dead Dimension!

His destination was the Dead Dimension.

Suddenly, Hou Qing’s voice resounded in Yang Ye’s mind, “Kid, don’t hate the shaman race!”

“Hate the shaman race?” Yang Ye shook his head, “Senior, you must be joking. Even if I do hate them, I can’t do anything to them!”

Hou Qing said, “Actually, if I was in their place, I would do the same. That sword can fall into the hands of any race, but absolutely not the human race.”

Yang Ye laughed bitterly, “This sword is a huge pain!”

“But it’s a huge opportunity too!” Hou Qing continued, “Kid, it’s not an ordinary sword. I’ll be extremely helpful to you in the future!”

Yang Ye laughed bitterly, “I hope so!”

Even though it had helped him a lot, the trouble it brought him was numerous too. He’d just arrived in the large universe, but he was already being pursued by numerous races. Even he really admired its ability to attract trouble to him.

After traveling on his sword for around a day, Yang Ye suddenly stopped.

There was a pitch black hole in space not too far ahead.

The Dead Dimension was on the other side!

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings and said, “The human race, sky race, devil race, and spirit race… Just you wait! I’ll be back to get even with you once I’m back!”

Yang Ye’s figure transformed into a ray of light that entered the black hole.
