Chapter 2467 – The Five World Realm!

Snowy started eating too!

Because Yang Ye was the strongest in Snowy’s heart. Unless she saw Yang Ye being beaten down with her own eyes, Yang Ye was the strongest and most invincible in her world!

As for Yang Ye’s strength, she had no idea how strong it was!

Outside the Primordial Pagoda.

Yang Ye and the middle aged man’s gazes met. They were just a few meters away from each other!

The middle aged man said, “That woman you killed was my subordinate! To be honest, I was mostly shocked when I heard that you killed her. You’re just at the True Dao Realm now. Of course, you’re intentionally suppressing your cultivation, but it still really shocked me. We knew that besides the Five World Realm, Four World Realm experts would just be giving their lives away in battle against you. So, I’m here.”

He shook his head and chuckled, “Once I saw you, I knew that even I am not fully confident in being able to kill you. My chances are only 70% at most! But that’s enough for me.”

Yang Ye suddenly opened his eyes, “I’ve been to the desolate race, and they really surprised me. I think something about them is very good, and it’s that they only believe in themselves and only rely on themselves! They never entrust their hopes to others, and they would never entrust their hopes to a future Sprite Progenitor. What about your Eternal Kingdom?”

The middle aged man laughed, “Actually, you’re mistaken. We haven’t entrusted our hopes to the Sprite Progenitor. There are many reasons why we want the Sprite Progenitor, like our unwillingness to let it fall into the desolate race’s hands! Moreover, the Sprite Progenitor should take the side of the righteous, right?”

“The righteous?” Yang Ye laughed with ridicule, “Eternal Kingdom is righteous? Don’t tell me you don’t know why the desolate race wishes to invade you!”

The middle aged man walked to the side, looked into the distance, and gazed at Zhao Wuji’s group, “Eternal Kingdom refuses to let the people of other universes enter it, and so they fight back. Actually, our ancestors expected this situation. But what do you think we should do? Open the doors to Eternal Kingdom and let everyone enter?”

Yang Ye replied with a question, “Can’t you?”

The middle aged man shook his head and chuckled, “You’re too young. Yang Ye, you’ve come all the way here from a small world, and you’ve experienced a lot. Let me ask you something. What is the usual cause of a world’s destruction?”

A world’s destruction!

Yang Ye frowned slightly and waited for the man to continue.

The middle aged man gazed at Yang Ye, “At most times, the world is destroyed not because of external forces, and not because of destiny. At most times, it’s actually us humans that court death on our own. Seizing! The humans in every world are madly seizing from their world without any restraint. A world’s resources are not limitless. Even a high-level world like Eternal Kingdom has finite resources.”

He chuckled at this point, “Perhaps you’re unaware but those people who were the first to reach Eternal Kingdom were actually from all around this universe. Once they arrived in Eternal Kingdom, they came together and made a decision. It was to close up Eternal Kingdom and ceaselessly strengthen the Universe Wall around Eternal Kingdom. So, the people of the other worlds are unable to enter Eternal Kingdom. Perhaps you think it’s a very selfish act, but allow me to be honest, if they didn’t do that, then Eternal Kingdom may have vanished by now. Even if it still exists, it would definitely be in its End Times!”

Yang Ye said, “So, doing all of this makes you righteous?”

The middle aged man shook his head, “There’s no need to consider righteousness. History is always written by the winner, and the winner is righteous while the loser is the evil side. I’m just trying to tell you that while it was selfish motivations which made Eternal Kingdom do that, these selfish motivations allowed Eternal Kingdom to remain until now. Moreover, Eternal Kingdom has a Covenant of the Strong!”

Yang Ye asked, “The Covenant of the Strong?”

The middle aged man nodded, “Once an expert at a certain level of strength dies in battle or at the end of their lifespans, they will disintegrate themselves and return all their energy back to the world. All the ancestors of Eternal Kingdom did that when they perished. Moreover, countless Talisman Masters and Formation Masters in Eternal Kingdom are tirelessly studying how to infinitely produce more spirit energy. I’m sure you’re heard that Eternal Kingdom has an extraordinary spirit vein, a divine vein. It’s precisely why Eternal Kingdom has been able to infinitely delay the arrival of its End Times! And for the sake of protecting it, Eternal Kingdom has exhausted huge amounts of effort and time!”

Yang Ye shook his head, “Sorry, that has nothing to do with me!”

The middle aged man said, “I naturally said so much to you because it has something to do with you. My Eternal Kingdom needs the Sprite Progenitor because only the joint forces of the Sprite Progenitor and divine vein can truly allow Eternal Kingdom’s spirit energy and resources to be reproduced infinitely. Everyone in Eternal Kingdom needs the Sprite Progenitor. So, we must obtain her!”

Yang Ye laughed coldly, “You need the Sprite Progenitor, so you try to take her by force and kill to obtain her? I won’t say anything about the fact that you hunted me. After all, we’re mortal enemies, so hunting me down isn’t wrong. However, what did the people of Eternal Village do wrong? Just because they know me, so they must be annihilated? Is that so?”

The middle aged man said, “Besides my Lord, there are many other voices in Eternal Kingdom, and some of them are very extreme. That incident…”

“Extreme?” A ferocious smile curled up on Yang Ye’s lips, “I’m more extreme than all of you!”

As soon as he said that, Yang Ye stopped wasting his breath and transformed into a ray of light that shot at the middle aged man.

The middle aged man shook his head slightly and stopped talking as well. He raised his right hand before him and used his palm to stop Yang Ye’s sword! However, Yang Ye suddenly twisted his sword with both hands.

At the same time, a wave of powerful energy rippled out from the middle aged man’s palm.

Bang!

Yang Ye was blasted over 300m away, and his figure slammed against the barrier.

Bang!

The barrier shook but only took a short moment to stop shaking.

The middle aged man glanced at his palm, and there was a tiny hole there!

It had been stabbed open by Yang Ye’s sword!

He’d used his energy to envelop his palm, but it had still been pierced.

The middle aged man gazed at Yang Ye, “As expected of my Eternal Kingdom’s number one sword, it’s very sharp. Unfortunately, your strength isn’t enough yet. You can’t fully utilize its strength.”

As soon as he finished speaking, the middle aged man suddenly appeared in front of Yang Ye, and then a wave of powerful energy slammed down on the latter.

It seemed like the sky was collapsing upon Yang Ye, and the heaviness of it made Yang Ye feel suffocated while his internal organs almost exploded apart!

Suddenly, Yang Ye’s figure turned ethereal, and then a ray of sword energy slashed down!

The Sword Domain!

At the critical moment, Yang Ye had used the Sword Domain again!

After five swings, he added one more!

Six swings with the Sword Domain!Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Bang!

As soon as the sixth swing descended, the world created by the barrier shook violently. At the same time, the middle aged man was pushed back repeatedly until his figure slammed against the barrier!

This time, his palm had cracked open!

The middle aged man looked up at Yang Ye, and then a flying sword suddenly shot at him.

The middle aged man raised his hand and swept it forward.

Bang!

It swept the flying sword away. Meanwhile, he clenched his left fist and slammed it at Yang Ye.

The air within the barrier was completely blasted apart by this punch, and explosions resounded incessantly. At the same time, a wave of powerful energy filled this world within the barrier!

It was ceaselessly trying to blast Yang Ye into bits!

If Yang Ye hadn’t used his sword intent and slaughter intent to stop it in time, he may have been blasted into mush by it!

However, the energy was too, too strong. Yang Ye’s sword intent and slaughter intent were being ceaselessly destroyed!

The middle aged man walked slowly in Yang Ye’s direction, “Your strength is not bad indeed. If I suppressed my cultivation, I would be no match for you. Unfortunately, I don’t have to suppress my cultivation in here.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he raised his right hand, and the energy in the surroundings suddenly converged above Yang Ye. Right when he was about to press his palm down, Yang Ye, who’d been bitterly holding on until now, suddenly leaped up and slashed his sword at the middle aged man!

The middle aged man’s eyes narrowed slightly, and he swung his right palm down like a blade.

The energy he’d converged earlier instantly appeared before him and blasted down!

The sword arrived!

Boom!

As soon as Yang Ye’s sword descended, he was blasted away. But this time, the middle aged man was blasted away as well. Once he stopped himself, a wisp of blood seeped out from the corner of his mouth!

Six swings with the Sword Domain!

That previous attack had been six overlapped swings with the Sword Domain. Even the middle aged man hadn’t been able to resist it completely!

But Yang Ye was in a worse state!

There was a price to pay for swings six times with the Sword Domain, and he’d done so twice in a short period. So, the price he paid was quite severe! Yang Ye’s countenance was pale while cracks covered his body, and blood had completely enveloped him!

The middle aged man gazed at Yang Ye, “According to my estimations, you’ll have to execute an attack like that at least 20 times to have a chance at killing me. Unfortunately, you can’t even execute it once more, right?”

The middle aged man walked slowly in Yang Ye’s direction while he spoke.

Meanwhile, strands of faint baleful energy appeared around Yang Ye, and it grew stronger and stronger…

Madness intent!

Once Yang Ye released his madness intent, the blood vessels beneath his skin suddenly started to tremble. At the same time, the madness intent and aura he emanated grew increasingly stronger!

The entire world within the barrier of water was shaking violently!
