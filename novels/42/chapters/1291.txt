Chapter 1292 – A Young Woman!

The young woman seemed to be only around the age of 17 or 18. Her figure was petite, her skin white as jade, and her features were exquisite. Especially her eyes, they simply sparkled like the most dazzling stars in the sky. She wore a violet dress with flower patterns, and she had beautiful dark violet shoulder-length hair and bangs. It wasn’t just her clothes and hair, even her brows were violet, and her enchanting eyes were violet as well.

A violet dress with flower patterns, dark violet hair, violet brows, violet eyes....

She seemed like a fairy that came from the deepest depths of a forest, and the cuteness she possessed carried a trace of mysteriousness.

Yang Ye naturally recognized her because it was Zi’er who’d been in closed door cultivation for an extremely long time.

Yang Ye was stunned at the sight of her. He hadn’t expected her to appear at a time like this. If it was at any other ordinary time, he would definitely feel overjoyed. Yet now....

Yang Ye pointed at his chest and said, “Get in now!” He spoke in an indisputable tone.

However, she shook her head. But Yang Ye didn’t get angry because of it. Yang Ye would never get angry at her, nor did he have the time to feel angry right now.

He immediately pulled her behind him and was about to activate the Sword God’s Seal. But Zi’er suddenly pulled him behind her, and right when he felt puzzled, she stretched out her hands and pushed outwards. Just that gentle movement made a spatial rift appear before her.

Zi’er took Yang Ye’s hand and entered the spatial rift, and it immediately closed once they entered it. Meanwhile, the black robed old man’s group hurriedly tore space open and entered the spatial rifts they created. However, they’d just entered the spatial rifts when their expressions suddenly changed drastically.

Bang!

The space around them suddenly rumbled and collapsed!

2 breaths of time later, the 4 of them emerged from within space around 10km away. At this moment, their faces had extremely solemn expressions on them, and there was a wisp of extremely striking scarlet red on the corner of their mouths. Moreover, the area behind them was completely pitch black like a huge black hole.

That was the expanse of space that collapsed earlier. For some reason, it actually hadn’t been repaired until now.

Their expressions grew more and more solemn as they gazed at the expanse of pitch black.

Suddenly, the space around them shook slightly before Senior Yuan and 3 other old men arrived here.

Senior Yuan spoke in a low voice, “Where’s Yang Ye?”

The black robed old man shook his head, “He escaped.”

Senior Yuan’s face fell, “Even if the 4 of you can’t kill him, your strength should have been sufficient to keep him busy. Did someone help him? Was it the Slayer Pavilion’s master?”

The old man shook his head slightly, “It was a young woman.” As he spoke, he pointed at the black hole and continued, “She caused that. If we didn’t flee in time, we would have probably been heavily injured as well.”

Senior Yuan’s group gazed at the black hole, and Senior Yuan’s eyes narrowed slightly while a trace of solemnness appeared within them, “It wasn’t shattered by force. This is.... It seems like space detonated itself.... How could that be possible? How could space possibly detonate itself?” As he finished speaking, Senior Yuan frowned while bewilderment filled his eyes.

Meanwhile, one of the old men spoke abruptly, “Could it have been the Laws of Space?”

The black robed old man shook his head slightly, “The Laws of Space isn’t that strong. That isn’t even the main point, the main point is that both of them seemed to have vanished into thin air once they entered a spatial rift. We couldn’t sense their presence even if we sealed the space around us. My guess is that the young woman possesses extremely formidable attainments in space or perhaps she possesses an extremely powerful spatial technique.”

Meanwhile, Senior Yuan waved his hand and said, “It’s pointless to talk about that now.”

As he spoke, he gazed at Yun Ling, “That fellow, Yang Ye, came to your Yun Clan just to rescue people?”

Yun Ling nodded, “It should be.”

Senior Yuan fell silent for a long time before he said, “Yang Ye possesses the Laws of Space. Obviously, it was the Slayer Pavilion’s master who taught it to him. In other words, the Slayer Pavilion and Sword Alliance have joined forces. That is a fact that’s beyond any doubt. As I’ve said before, the threat Yang Ye poses is a future threat, but the threat that the Slayer Pavilion poses is a current one. So, I’ve decided to eliminate the Slayer Pavilion first. Once the Slayer Pavilion is gone and no one is there to assist Yang Ye in secret, then it wouldn’t be much of a problem for us to annihilate Yang Ye. However, if we attempt to annihilate Yang Ye first, the Slayer Pavilion will definitely attack the clans and sects behind us. If all of us leave the Veiled Region, there won’t be anyone left to stop that group of assassins.”

“Would splitting up work?” The black robed old man spoke solemnly, “We’ll send half our forces to Dark Hell Continent to annihilate Yang Ye, and the remaining will stay in the Veiled Region to crush the Slayer Pavilion.”

“That’s not advisable!” Senior Yuan shook his head and continued, “I’m sure all of you’ve witnessed Yang Ye’s strength. A few Voiders will probably be unable to annihilate him, and they might even be killed by him. As for the Slayer Pavilion’s strength, all of you should be aware of it as well. For some unknown reason, they haven’t launched a counterattack, but once they do, a few Voiders wouldn’t be able to stop them at all. So, it’s very unwise to spread our forces.”

“Senior Yuan is right!” One of the Voiders nodded and spoke with agreement, “Regardless of whether it’s Yang Ye or the Slayer Pavilion, both aren’t ordinary. We should converge our strength to deal with the Slayer Pavilion first, and then deal with Yang Ye. If we spread our forces, then it’ll be just as Senior Yuan said. We might not be able to kill him and would be killed by him instead.”

The others nodded to display their agreement.

When he saw that the others had no objections, Senior Yuan said, “We’ll bring our full force upon the Slayer Pavilion and strive to crush it in the shortest time possible!”

...

A few hundred kilometers away, an expanse of space shook slightly before space seemed to be sliced open by a sharp blade, and a spatial rift appeared there. Zi’er and Yang Ye walked out from the rift.

“Zi’er....” Yang Ye grabbed her hand and pulled her into his arms before speaking softly, “You’re finally out here again....”

Zi’er blushed slightly from being embraced by him, but her body shook slightly when she heard him, and then she put her hands around Yang Ye’s waist.

Both of them didn’t speak, and they just hugged each other tightly.

No words were greater than a hug.

Meanwhile, a ray of white light suddenly flashed, and then Snowy appeared on Yang Ye’s shoulder. She blinked as she gazed at Yang Ye and Zi’er, and then she flew over to Zi’er’s shoulder before rubbing her head against Zi’er’s face. After doing that for a while, she flew over to Yang Ye’s shoulder and rubbed her head against his face....

Yang Ye let go of Zi’er, and then both of them glanced at Snowy before smiling at each other.

Snow was clearly extremely fond of Zi’er. She immediately went over to Zi’er’s shoulder before planting a light kiss on Zi’er’s cheek. Zi’er rubbed Snowy’s head gently while a trace of tender affection arose in her eyes. Snowy had been constantly accompanying her while she was in closed door cultivation, so she was quite emotionally attached to Snowy as well.

Yang Ye grinned as he gazed at them, and then he stretched out his hand with the intention of rubbing Zi’er’s head. However, Zi’er avoided his hand, and then she glanced at him and said, “I’ve grown up.”

Yang Ye was stunned. His hand stopped in midair while his face stiffened slightly. Moreover, a strand of complicated emotions surged out from within him. He chuckled slightly unnaturally and withdrew his hand, “Yes, you’ve grown up. You’ve grown up.”

“Fool!” Zi’er rolled her eyes at him, took his hand, and spoke softly, “Even if I’ve grown up, I’m still your Zi’er. But you can’t treat me like a child anymore. Snowy is the child, understand?”

She’s still the same! Yang Ye heaved a sigh of relief in his heart. He’d thought that they’d grown apart, but now it would seem like he’d been overthinking.

Yang Ye took Zi’er’s hand and spoke softly, “Zi’er, you’re an Emperor now?”

She nodded in response.

Yang Ye took a deep breath when he saw her nod, and then he said, “You’ve actually attained the Emperor Realm. That... that’s such a blow to me.” As he finished speaking, he laughed bitterly. After all, Zi’er was only a Saint when she went into closed door cultivation, yet she’d instantly attained the Emperor Realm. Yet now, he was just a Quasi Emperor, so it really was a blow to his confidence.

She pointed at his stomach and said, “It’s because of that violet energy of yours. It’s very pure and even purer than Quintessence Violet Energy. I was only able to attain the Emperor in such a short period because I’ve been absorbing it every day.”

Yang Ye nodded. Actually, he’d guessed that. Because she’d only followed him in the beginning because of the Primordial Violet Energy. Moreover, Zi’er’s speed of advancement had become extremely swift since she started staying by his side. Actually, his speed of advancement was extremely swift as well. Ordinary people would take a few hundred years to attain the Emperor Realm, and even those with good natural talent would take a few dozen years. However, he’d merely used just a little over 10 years of time to attain the Quasi Emperor Realm!

It could be said that it was all thanks to the Primordial Violet Energy that he was able to attain the Quasi Emperor Realm in such a short time!

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts, took Zi’er’s hand, and smiled, “Let’s go.”

His Sword Puppet had sent Yun Banming and Yun Banqing’s mother out of the Veiled Region. So, it was pointless to stay in the Veiled Region. Now, the important matter at hand for him was to head back and develop the Sword Alliance with all his ability. Besides that, he had to improve his own strength.

Suddenly, Zi’er frowned slightly, and then she waved her left hand slightly. The space around them instantly shook intensely, and then a woman appeared not too far away from them.

Yang Ye frowned when he saw her. Because it was Qian Lankong.

Qian Lankong’s gaze descended onto Zi’er, and her eyes were filled with shock, “You.... You.... How did you do that?!” She’d merged herself into the space there just now. However, that young woman before her had just waved her hand lightly, and then she’d been pushed out from space. Yes, she’d been forcefully pushed straight out of space!

Zi’er didn’t answer Qian Lankong and just gazed at Yang Ye.

Yang Ye said, “Qian Lankong, do you need something?” Qian Lankong’s gaze moved from Zi’er to Yang Ye when she heard him speak, and then she said, “Yang Ye, the Yuan Clan and those other powers are attacking madly, and my Slayer Pavilion has already lost....”

Yang Ye waved his hand and interrupted her, “Miss Qian, everything you just said has nothing to do with me.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye started walking away while holding onto Zi’er’s hand.
