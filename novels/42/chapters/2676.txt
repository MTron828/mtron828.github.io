Chapter 2677 – Snowy’s Past!

Book 22 — What Lies Beyond

The Energy of Past Life!

It was an indescribable form of energy, and it was an energy Yang Ye had never experienced.Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Past Life was like transcendence, and it could also be considered as destruction.

It was a very profound form of energy. It was like a different form of energy beyond profound energy. Yang Ye had seen many different forms of energy like Faith Energy… Past Life Energy was a different type of energy like that!

Just like that, a long time passed before Yang Ye lost consciousness.

The woman in white put Yang Ye down and raised her right hand slightly. A huge rock suddenly appeared beneath Yang Ye.

Meanwhile, an old man appeared nearby.

The old man with the bamboo chest!

At this moment, the old man’s face was pale, and there was a strand of mysterious energy around him.

The energy was ceaselessly devouring him!

The woman in white glanced at him, and then she waved her right hand. Past Life shot over from afar.

Meanwhile, the old man shook his head.

Past Life stopped right before him.

The old man spoke softly, “If you destroy it, that existence may sense it.”

The woman in white shook her head, “It doesn’t matter!”

As soon as she finished speaking, Past Life slashed down.

Hiss!

The mysterious energy around the old man was slashed into bits.

Meanwhile, the sky shook, and the old man sighed softly.

The woman in white glanced at the sky and smiled, “I still have some time. Let me finish up a few more things!”

She gazed at Yang Ye who was lying on the rock. Meanwhile, Erya and Snowy appeared by his side. Erya had vigilance all over her face. The woman in white looked exactly like the woman in black, so she wasn’t very friendly!

The woman in white glanced at Erya and Snowy, and she smiled, “You two are actually together now, and you’re even so close…”

She gazed at Yang Ye, “This fellow is really quite interesting!”

Erya sized up the woman in white and said, “Are you with that woman in black?”

The woman in white smiled, “What do you think?”

Erya shook her head, “You don’t seem like it. You aren’t that unbearable, unlike that woman in black who’s always asking for a beating!”

The woman in white shook her head and smiled, “Your temper is as violent as it was all those years ago.”

She gazed at the old man, and the latter nodded slightly and patted his bamboo chest. A crystalline and translucent fragment floated over to Erya.

An inner core fragment!

Erya immediately grabbed it!

It was an instinctive reaction!

Her intuition told her that she really needed that fragment.

Erya gazed at it for a long time and looked up at the woman in white, “This is for me?”

The woman in white nodded slightly, “I shattered your inner core in battle many years ago, and I kept one of the fragments as a form of respect. Now, since you’re with him, and your character has changed to the point you’re not as unreasonable as before, I’m giving it back to you!”

Erya spoke in a slightly bitter tone, “I was no match for you in the past?”

The old man shook his head and smiled.

The woman in white chuckled as well, “Actually, you were very, very formidable all those years ago. However, you met my strongest form. I was extremely formidable then, and your ability to pose a threat to me was absolutely amazing.”

Erya shook her head, “I’m still very weak.”

“Not at all!” The old man suddenly said, “Your strength was incomparably terrifying.”

He glanced at the woman in white and continued, “You were actually equally matched to her in a one-on-one battle!”

The woman in white nodded slightly and didn’t deny that.

Erya was very strong all those years ago.

At that time, even Qi Bitian at her prime was inferior to Erya!

Of course, there were many, many true experts in that era. Besides Destiny in her whole form, there were many equally matched existences!

Erya hesitated for a moment and said, “If I work hard on cultivating, would I be able to defeat that woman in black?”

The woman in white smiled, “It’s very likely!”

Erya nodded and didn’t say anything else.

Meanwhile, Snowy pointed at herself. Of course, she didn’t forget to shoot a glance at the bamboo chest behind the old man.

The woman in white walked over to Snowy and rubbed the latter’s head, “I’m very sorry about what happened to you. In order to protect the sprites of this world, you even wanted to annihilate the humans, demons, and all the other races…”

She shook her head and smiled, “You were more overbearing and cruel than Erya ever was!”

The Sprite Progenitor!

Kindness!

Actually, besides her, very few in the world knew how terrifying the Sprite Progenitor had been. At that time, Snowy wasn’t called the Sprite Progenitor, she was the Good Sprite, the symbol of goodness in the world. However, this goodness wasn’t extended to humans, demons, and the other races, it was only for other sprites.

The humans and the other races plundered the world for their own agenda, and destroyed the universe. So, Snowy’s response to this had been to summon all the sprites and slaughter the humans and the other races!

She was serious about it!

The woman in white shook her head and chuckled when she recalled the past. At that time, if she hadn’t stepped forward, then the human race and all the other races would have been annihilated.

Snowy’s plan at the time was for only sprites to remain in the world!

As for everything else? They should just vanish!

Now, this little fellow before her…

The woman in white chuckled, “The world is always changing!”

She rubbed Snowy’s head, and then a strand of mysterious energy entered Snowy.

Snowy shuddered and gazed at the woman with bewilderment.

The woman spoke softly, “It can help you become extremely amazing. Sense it slowly and multiply that strand of profound energy. Understand?”

Snowy nodded, and then she pointed at the old man’s bamboo chest. She was saying that she wanted it.

The old man’s face darkened. Why won’t that little fellow ever forget my bamboo chest?

The woman in white pinched Snowy’s cheek and looked up at the sky, “Send him to the World of Past Life once he wakes up.”

The old man frowned slightly, “That place…”

She smiled, “Since he has obtained my sword, he has the right to go there.”

She tapped Yang Ye’s forehead at this moment. In an instant, Yang Ye’s body shook, and then his cultivation was completely sealed!

The old man laughed bitterly, “His strength was never very strong, and now that you’ve even sealed his cultivation, aren’t you sending him to his death?”

She shook her head and smiled, “What is the strongest sword?”

The old man fell silent for a moment and replied, “The Ordinary Sword!”

She nodded slightly, “The sword is just ordinary metal, and it’s extraordinary because of its wielder. I’ve sealed his cultivation because I hope it’ll help him comprehend what a sword really is!”

She gazed at Yang Ye and said, “Haven’t you noticed? His Sword Dao and Sword Heart are already at his limits. What I’m doing is helping him remove everything so that he can put in something new! The Energy of Past Life is merely an initial gift, and as for the rest, the amount he can obtain is up to him.”

A huge vortex appeared in the sky once she finished speaking.

The woman in white grinned, “Tell him that Qi Bitian and Tian Xiu are in the outer area of the Four Dimensional Universe, and it’s very dangerous there. They need help, and if he can’t improve quickly, then they will most likely die.”

She glanced at Yang Ye and smiled, “Encouragement is necessary, but so is pressure. I chose you, and I’ve done what I can for you. The rest is up to you!”

She suddenly transformed into a ray of white light that shot up into the sky.

A short while later, the white light entered the vortex, and then the entire sky gradually calmed down.

Once the woman in white left, Snowy suddenly appeared before the old man. She cracked a smile and pointed at the bamboo chest.

It was obvious what she wanted!

The old man laughed bitterly, “I can’t give that to you.”

Snowy blinked, and a sword appeared in her grasp.

It was Past Life!

She waved it lightly while her eyes narrowed slightly, and she just stared at the bamboo chest.

The old man laughed bitterly, “Little fellow, there are some things in there, but some of them don’t belong to me. I’m just keeping some of them safe for others. So, I really can’t give it to you!”

Snowy blinked. She pointed at herself to say that she could help them keep it safe!

The old man glanced at her with a weird gaze in his eyes. You will keep them safe? No one would ever believe you! All of them will be gone once they fall into your hands!

He knew the little fellow’s style very well.

Suddenly, Erya walked over. She glanced at Snowy and frowned, “Snowy, how can you be like that? It belongs to someone else, so we can’t ask for it. Understand?”

The old man almost cried when he heard Erya.

She’s truly sensible!

Meanwhile, Erya gazed at the old man and said, “Old man, forgive Snowy. She isn’t very sensible.”

The old man hurriedly shook his head, “Of course, of course!”

Erya nodded, and then she gazed at the bamboo chest, “That bamboo chest looks really good. Can you let me have a look at it? I just want to have a look!”

The old man hesitated for a moment and nodded. It was because Erya seemed quite sensible and had helped him out of the previous predicament, so he felt that letting her have a look was alright!

The old man passed it to her and smiled, “Just don’t open it!”

Erya nodded and took it from him. After that, she passed it to Snowy, and Snowy just sent it into the Primordial Pagoda.

The old man was stunned, and then he gazed at Erya, “Um… Didn’t you say that you were only going to take a look?”

Erya nodded, “I’ll be taking a slow look later!”

The old man gulped and said, “Uh, just give it back to me!”

Erya gazed at the old man with bewilderment, “Why should I?”

The old man was stunned, “You borrowed it from me, so of course you must return it!”

Erya blinked, “But I didn’t say when…”

She raised a finger at this point, “100 years, I’ll return it in 100 years. I always keep my word!”

The old man was stunned speechless.
