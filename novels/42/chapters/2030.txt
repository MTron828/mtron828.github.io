Chapter 2031 – The Gui Clan!

At this moment, Yang Ye’s expression was extremely solemn.

This weak woman before him was actually able to see the evil treasure that was following him! If what she said before seemed like she was being deliberately mystifying, then what she said now allowed Yang Ye to realize that she was no ordinary person!

The evil treasure!

It was something that practically only Sages could detect!

Was she a Sage?

She didn’t really seem like one. Because she wouldn’t be in this condition if she was!

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts and spoke solemnly, “Who are you?”

The woman shook her head slightly, “Young man, I don’t know if it’s the heavens’ plan or just a coincidence that we met here and you chose to interfere. However, it isn’t important.” She gazed at the little girl, Tian Xiu, and said, “Xiu’er, our clan was born to defy the heavens and so the heavens reject us. It isn’t our fault. Remember that every being in this world has its own life, and when you want to help someone, you can ask your heart for the answer. If you really want to help, then do it. Just follow your heart. Understand?”

Tian Xiu raised the squished bun to the woman’s mouth, “Mom, eat this. You’ll get better after eating it. It’s really tasty!”

The woman grinned and took a small bite, “Besides that, you must listen to your big brother over there. He didn’t turn a blind eye just because you were ordinary, and he showed sympathy instead. This proves that he’s a good person who stays true to his heart. So, you can trust him. Understand?”

Meanwhile, Tian Xiu suddenly started crying, “Mom, are you going to abandon me?”

The woman stroked her face lightly and said, “Xiu’er, when you grow older, you must remember that everything I did today was done so willingly. I don’t regret anything. My greatest wish is to see you alive and well!”

She gazed at Yang Ye and continued, “Young man, there’s too much karma coiled around you, and two types of them are existences that even I can’t see clearly.”

As soon as she finished speaking, she waved her hand, and a thumb-sized pearl appeared before Yang Ye, “It’s called the Rebirth Pearl. Perhaps a day and time will come when it’ll be able to help you.”

She suddenly looked up at the ceiling and spoke softly, “If the heavens want someone’s death, that person has to die. Words that defy the heavens… They are so ignorant and laughable.”

It didn’t take long for Yang Ye to sense her lifespan vanish rapidly.

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment before using Primordial Violet Energy on her. However, Yang Ye was shocked to notice that as soon as it touched her, the Primordial Violet Energy actually turned back and returned to the Primordial Pagoda!

It wasn’t the woman who’d refused it, it had been the Primordial Pagoda!

It refused to save her!

It was the first time this had ever happened!

Meanwhile, she suddenly gazed at Yang Ye, “Don’t be surprised, it’s saving you. It doesn’t want some things to target you. Young man, I’ll leave Tian Xiu to you. You only have to protect her until she’s 18. Once she’s 18… she’ll protect you!”

The woman took her last breath once she finished speaking.

She was dead!

Yang Ye looked at Tian Xiu. She didn’t cry and just gazed at the woman on the bed.

Yang Ye sighed softly and patted her head. He was about to speak when she looked up at Yang Ye, “Big Brother, can you help me bury mom?”

Yang Ye nodded, “Of course!” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

At a mountain outside the town, Yang Ye stood before a grave. There was a little girl by his side, and she was kneeling by the grave.

Just like that, she knelt there for over two hours, and then she suddenly kowtowed three times, “Mom, Xiu’er is going now. Xiu’er will be back to see you!”

She stood up and walked over to Yang Ye. Yang Ye rubbed her head and took her hand before walking off!

Suddenly, something unexpected occurred. A bolt of lightning shot down from the sky. It was extremely swift and instantly slammed against the grave.

Boom!

The grave was obliterated!

Yang Ye looked up at the sky while gloominess covered his face, “You won’t even let the dead rest?”

He received no reply!

Tian Xiu was staring blankly into the distance. A short while passed before she looked up at the sky and spoke softly, “Big Brother, why?”

Yang Ye fell silent.

“Why?” She gazed at Yang Ye and asked again.

Yang Ye spoke softly, “Big Brother can’t answer you. However, you can go ask it yourself in the future. Stand before it and ask it. But you can’t do that now. Understand?”

Tian Xiu nodded and didn’t say another word.

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and said, “Stay in the town for now. I’m going to deal with some things, and then I’ll come back for you…”

Tian Xiu looked up at Yang Ye, “Big Brother, you don't want me to follow you?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “No, it’s just that where I’m going may be dangerous!”

Tian Xiu said, “Xiu’er isn’t afraid!”

Yang Ye shook his head and said, “Alright, Big Brother will take you somewhere else. There’s a little fellow in there. You can play with her!”

As he spoke, he waved his right hand and sent her into the Primordial Pagoda.

In the Primordial Pagoda, Snowy stared at the little girl who’d just appeared before her, and the latter was doing the same.

Suddenly, Tian Xiu said, “You’re Snowy!”

Snowy blinked while surprise filled her eyes. She seemed to be asking how Tian Xiu knew!

Tian Xiu looked up at the sky, “There’s something looking at me from up there. It doesn’t seem to welcome me here!”

Snowy glanced up into the sky. She blinked, and then waved her claws slightly.

Tian Xiu spoke softly, “Really?”

Snowy hurriedly nodded.

Tian Xiu said, “Then we’re friends. You protect me now, and I’ll protect you in the future.”

Snowy cracked a smile.

The na?ve Snowy didn’t know that her kindness today would give her the support of an extraordinary expert in the future.

In the future, Snowy merely had to wave her claw and the worlds would tremble before her!

Just like that, Snowy had a new friend, and it didn’t take long for the two little fellows to start playing together.

…

In the town, Ji Yue was still waiting on the spot.

Yang Ye said, “I’m sorry for making you wait!”

She nodded slightly, “It’s fine. It’s not a problem at all. Have you dealt with everything?”

Yang Ye nodded.

She smiled, “Brother Yang, you’re a man who really follows his heart in everything! However, that little girl is probably not ordinary, right?”

Yang Ye replied, “Miss Ji Yue, you’ve made this complicated for no reason. Actually, most things are very simple, and it only becomes complicated because of impure intentions.”

Ji Yue fell silent for a moment and said, “I see!”

Yang Ye said, “Let’s go!”

She nodded slightly, and the three of them continued forward. They remained silent all along the way, and it didn’t take long for them to leave the town and arrive before a mountain behind the town.

The ground there was flat like a mirror.

Ji Yue spoke softly, “Brother Yang, wait a moment, a few more people will be here soon!”

Yang Ye gazed at her, “You invited others?”

She shook her head, “Within this paradise is another world. Actually, the reason those Sages chose to create this paradise here is because of the smaller natural paradise here. It’s owned by all four clans, so all four clans have to join forces to access it!”

Yang Ye nodded, “Then let’s wait for them!”

Time trickled by. Around two hours later, a young man suddenly walked over from afar. He had a sword on his back, and small golden words were embroidered on his chest—Xuanyuan.

Yang Ye glanced at the man and moved his gaze away. He didn’t have a good impression of the Xuanyuan Clan. After all, it had come to look for trouble with him that day.

The man stopped when he arrived near them, and he said, “Xuanyuan Yan!”

Ji Yue nodded slightly, “Ji Yue!”

They fell silent upon greeting each other, and none said another word.

Just like that, four hours passed before another man arrived. He wore a luxurious robe and had hair that hung down to his shoulder, and he seemed very unrestrained and carefree. He glanced at Ji Yue and Xuanyuan Yan before he said, “Jiang Po!”

Ji Yue and Xuanyuan Yan nodded and introduced themselves again.

Only one clan from the four clans remained!

The Gui Clan!

Around another two hours passed, but the expert from the Gui Clan still hadn’t arrived.

Jiang Po suddenly said, “The Gui Clan is always so slow!”

Ji Yue grinned, “I’m sure they got delayed by something. It’s fine, let’s just wait a while longer!”

Jiang Po nodded and gazed at Yang Ye, “Who’s that?”

Yang Ye was about to speak when Ji Yue said, “Ji Ye, my cousin. He’s here to have a look.”

“Oh?” Jiang Po sized up Yang Ye, “Since the Ji Clan allowed you to come, you’re definitely not anyone ordinary!”

He suddenly chuckled, “I’m quite curious, which one of you will take control of the Ji Clan in the future?”

Ji Yue smiled and didn’t answer him.

Yang Ye would naturally not say anything. He was merely here to help Ji Yue, so he was just doing what she wanted for now!

Time trickled by, and another hour passed before a voice suddenly resounded, “I’m sorry for keeping you waiting!”

Along with the voice, a black figure appeared at the center. The figure was completely pitch black like a shadow, and its appearance couldn’t be seen at all.

Suddenly, the black figure gazed at Yang Ye, “Have we met?”
