Chapter 1488 - Charging Into The Semi-Deity Realm!

Translator: InVader

It was hot!

As soon as he walked into the volcano, his body had almost melted from the extreme heat here!

There was another reason why Yang Ye felt astounded, and it was because he hadn’t expected the heat here to actually be so terrifying that his body couldn’t endure it. After all, his body was at the Undying Realm.

Fortunately, he’d formed a protective barrier with his sword intent and slaughter intent at the critical moment.

He instantly felt much better while protected within the barrier.

Yang Ye immediately glanced at the surroundings and shot towards the center of the Volcano. As he went deeper into the volcano, the temperature grew higher and higher, and it made Yang Ye have no choice but to constantly utilize sword intent and slaughter intent to resist it.

A long time passed before Yang Ye stopped.

There was a tree of fire in the distance, and it looked like it was made completely out of fire. A wisp of burning desire appeared in Yang Ye’s eyes because there were five bright red fruits on the tree. The fruits seemed like they were made of lava, and they were completely crimson red. Moreover, faint fiery red light flowed through them.

Fire Spirit Fruits!

Obviously, they were the Fire Spirit Fruits!

Yang Ye didn’t go take them immediately, and he carefully observed the surroundings instead. After all, who knew if there was anything else here besides the Lava Titan which could pose a threat to him!

What if another Lava Titan appeared? He would be in trouble!

In the end, once he confirmed that there was no danger, Yang Ye went over to the huge tree, and then he waved his hand and put the Fire Spirit Fruits within his spatial ring.

It was smooth!

Extremely smooth!

Right when Yang Ye was about to leave, he suddenly looked down. There was a fire lotus beneath him, and it was closed. So, he couldn’t see what was within it.

Yang Ye remained silent for a moment, and then he turned around and walked away. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

He was very well aware that something was in there. Or it may even be a treasure. However, he didn’t take a look. It wasn’t wise to be too greedy. Because while those who were too greedy may end up being rich, even more brought death upon themselves. As far as he was concerned, the Fire Spirit Fruits were sufficient.

However, the fire lotus suddenly started unfurling slowly.

Yang Ye stopped and looked down, and there was a trace of vigilance in his eyes. But he was stunned when it was fully unfurled because there was a small ball of flames at the center of the fire lotus.

A Sprite? That was the first thing which came to mind. Yang Ye paid no attention to it and intended to leave. However, the ball of flame suddenly appeared in front of him, and then two small hands emerged from it. The hands were very small like the hands of a child. After that, it didn’t take long for a small head to emerge from the ball of flame as well.

In an instant, a little girl who was completely fiery red and emanated flames appeared before Yang Ye. She seemed to be around the age of two or three, and she looked very cute. However, Yang Ye had a very vigilant expression on his face.

The little girl floated around Yang Ye, and her eyes were filled with curiosity.

Suddenly, the tiny vortex spun within him, and then a wave of suction force surged out and instantly sucked the little girl into the Primordial Pagoda!

Yang Ye was stunned!

An instant later, Yang Ye’s expression changed drastically, and he was about to immerse his consciousness into his body.

Suddenly, a hysterical howl of fury resounded from outside the volcano, and then a wave of deadly pressure assaulted Yang Ye!

“Fuck!” Yang Ye cursed, and then he fled. Right when he left the volcano, a huge flaming fist carried a wave of fire as it slammed down in his direction!

Yang Ye’s expression changed, and he hurriedly withdrew the casket lid to shield himself.

Boom!

Yang Ye and the casket lid were blasted away.

Right when his figure was blasted away, a multicolored ribbon appeared behind him and supported his figure. After that, Lian Banzhuang appeared in front of him. She grabbed his shoulder and vanished towards the distance.

Lian Banzhuang asked, “Did you get it?”

Yang Ye nodded.

She was visibly delighted and was about to speak. Suddenly, she turned to look towards the distance, and she saw a wave of fire approaching from not too far behind them.

She frowned at the sight of this. She remained silent for a moment, and then she gazed at Yang Ye, “What did you do in there?”

Yang Ye smiled bitterly. He hadn’t done anything, and it had nothing to do with him! It was the Primordial Pagoda!

Lian Banzhuang stared at Yang Ye, “It usually never leaves its territory, but it’s constantly chasing us now. Moreover, I can sense that it’s very angry. You definitely didn’t just take Fire Spirit Fruits from there!”

Yang Ye nodded, “Indeed!”

Lian Banzhuang’s face became cold, “No matter what you took, return it right now. Otherwise, we’ll die!”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Why would we die?”

She was quite angry, “This place is filled with danger. If it doesn’t stop chasing us, then how would we flee? What if we fled to some dangerous area? We would face enemies from both ahead and behind us! But we’re unable to kill it at all. Not to mention just the two of us, we wouldn’t be able to kill it even if we had one more Dualism Realm expert on our side. Understand?”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and said, “I understand. But this thing is quite complicated. I’m serious. I didn’t intend to take it. So, carry me with you and flee for now. I’ll try to resolve the matter.”

“15 minutes!” Lian Banzhuang gazed at Yang Ye, “If you don’t hand it over in 15 minutes, then face it on your own!”

As soon as she finished speaking, she didn’t speak another word and just held onto Yang Ye’s shoulder as she sped up.

Yang Ye laughed bitterly. The Primordial Pagoda always did things like this. Even if you want some things, you have to think for me. I’m so weak, yet you just take without any thoughts. I can’t afford to bear the consequences of it!

Yang Ye shook his head and immersed his consciousness into his body. He scanned the 1st level, but he didn’t notice the little girl.

She isn’t here? Yang Ye went to the 2nd level. Sure enough, he saw the little girl there. At this moment, she was floating in front of the pill furnace, and she was staring at the Divine Yin Flame within the pill furnace. She stared at it for a while, and then she stretched out her hand with the intent to touch the Divine Yin Flame. However, she seemed to be afraid of something and pulled her hand back. But she still wanted to touch it, so she stretched it forward slowly again.

Yang Ye’s clone appeared before the little girl. She seemed to not fear Yang Ye at all. She cracked a smile when she saw him, and then she turned around and looked at the Divine Yin Flame again.

Yang Ye’s clone glanced at the Divine Yin Flame. He’d thought that the Primordial Pagoda had dragged the little girl in here, but now it would seem like it was clearly the Divine Yin Flame which had done it.

Yang Ye thought for a moment and said, “Senior, you’re not thinking of devouring her, right?” Such beings could devour each other to improve themselves, and that was why he thought in that way.

Meanwhile, a ray of fire shot out from the Divine Yin Flame. It was extremely swift and instantly entered the center of the little girl’s forehead. Her figure instantly shuddered, and then the flames around her instantly started trembling violently before starting to transform.

Yang Ye heaved a sigh of relief. It has no intention to devour the little girl. It might have taken a liking to her and wanted to give her some guidance.

The little girl was clearly a Sprite, and she may even be a small Sprite King. However, she was definitely inferior when compared to the Divine Yin Flame. He didn’t know what level the Divine Yin Flame was at, but he knew that it was extremely strong. Perhaps it could even melt the casket.

Meanwhile, the little girl’s body had calmed down.

At this moment, Yang Ye felt that the flames she emanated had become even more terrifying. Obviously, the Divine Yin Flame had helped transform her.

It was definitely an absolutely great fortune for her.

Suddenly, a voice resounded, “Take her and go!”

Yang Ye glanced at the Divine Yin Flame, and then he gazed at the little girl. The little girl walked over to the pill furnace, and then she stretched out her hand and touched the Divine Yin Flame gently. She seemed extremely happy when it didn’t harm her.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye walked over to her side and smiled, “You can come here again if we meet again in the future!”

She’d obtained the Divine Yin Flame’s acknowledgement, so letting her come here would definitely not bring any danger to him. It wasn’t a big deal at all.

She turned to glance at Yang Ye, and her smile grew even more brilliant.

Just like that, Yang Ye took her in his arms and left the Primordial Pagoda while she gazed reluctantly at the Divine Yin Flame.

In the outside world.

Lian Banzhuang’s eyelids twitched when she saw a little flaming girl had suddenly appeared in Yang Ye’s arms, “A Sprite. You…”

Yang Ye shrugged, and then he started walking towards the Lava Titan while holding the little girl. The Lava Titan had been about to attack, but it instantly stopped when it saw the little girl in Yang Ye’s arms.

The little girl was visibly happy when she saw the Lava Titan, and then she transformed into a ray of fiery light that appeared before it. No one knew what she said to it, but the hostility in the Lava Titan’s eyes vanished, but a trace of vigilance still remained.

The Lava Titan didn’t speak. It just glanced at Yang Ye and Lian Banzhuang, and then it turned around and walked away. Suddenly, the little girl flew over to Yang Ye and hugged him gently. After that, she turned around and returned to the Lava Titan.

The Lava Titan didn’t stay, nor did it turn back. But the little girl kept waving to Yang Ye.

A long time passed before the Lava Titan and little girl vanished from their fields of vision.

Yang Ye withdrew his gaze, flipped his palm, and three Fire Spirit Fruits appeared before Lian Banzhuang, “There were five. You did the most, so you get three.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he turned around and started walking away.

Lian Banzhuang glanced at the fruits before her, and then she gazed at him, “Where are you going?”

“That’s none of your business!” As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye vanished on the spot. Even though they’d worked together just now, Yang Ye really didn’t want to have anything to do with her.

It was best to stay far away from such a person!

Lian Banzhuang looked in the direction Yang Ye had vanished towards, and she remained silent. No one knew what she was thinking.

…

After he left Lian Banzhuang, Yang Ye found a place he felt was comparatively safe, and then he entered the ground. Once he traveled over 3km underground, Yang Ye took out the ice casket. After that, he laid down in the ice casket before entering the Primordial Pagoda.

In the 1st level of the Primordial Pagoda, Yang Ye withdrew a Fire Spirit Fruit and swallowed it.

He intended to charge into the Semi-Deity Realm!
