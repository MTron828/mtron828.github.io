Chapter 2783 – Fight to the Heart’s Content!

The Ordinary Sword!

The shadow hadn’t chosen to stop Yang Ye mainly because he felt Yang Ye’s strength wasn’t sufficient to break through the vortex.

But he hadn’t expected Yang Ye to have attained the Ordinary Sword!

The shadow was about to stop Yang Ye, but a wave of sword energy sealed off his path of retreat. At the same time, a woman stood before him.

The woman in white!

She grinned, and then rays of light appeared around the shadow. They were like a cage that completely surrounded him.

Meanwhile, a pike appeared in the shadow’s grasp.

The shadow took the pike in both hands and stabbed it down before him.

Bang!

In an instant, a wave of powerful energy rippled through the area, but the sword energy didn’t shatter and kept the shadow there.

Suddenly, the shadow turned a little more solid.

After that, he swept the pike forward.

Bang!

The sword energy there was pushed back, and it flickered back into the sword in the woman’s hand.

The shadow looked to the side. At this moment, Yang Ye and An Nanjing had vanished from his field of vision, and there were numerous huge corpses in the surroundings.

The shadow hurled the pike forward.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly stopped, and when he turned around, a pike was just around 1m away from him.

Yang Ye took a step forward and stabbed.

It was a fluid string of movements!

Clang!

An ear piercing sound of metal colliding resounded. The pike shook violently and was blasted away!

Yang Ye didn’t even look back in that direction before vanishing into the distance. Of course, An Nanjing was following close behind him.

In the starry sky.

The shadow gazed at the woman in white, “According to my knowledge, she has spared you trice. Trust me, there won’t be a third!”

The woman in white smiled, “I know.”

The shadow said, “You’re courting death.”

She nodded, “I’m sure you’re aware that she won’t spare you either. So, why do you obey her commands? Can’t our universes coexist?”

The shadow chuckled, “Have you taken a look at my Four Dimensional Universe? It’s in ruins, and we…”

She shook her head, “You brought this upon yourselves. After your Yanmo Clan became the strongest clan in the Four Dimensional Universe, how did you treat the others? You slaughtered until the world lost balance, and spirit energy was even exhausted by your clan without any restraints. So, who can you blame for the situation your universe is in?”

The shadow shook his head, “Our universes can coexist. Just kill that woman, and we can live in peace!”

She glanced at the shadow, “So send us to risk our lives against her, and then your universe will reap the rewards. That’s a great idea.”

The shadow didn’t say anything. He just suddenly appeared before her. Meanwhile, she swung her sword, and an expanse of sword energy enveloped the shadow.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye and An Nanjing had killed their way into the Four Dimensional Universe!

All along the way, experts had ceaselessly arrived before them, but even peak Destiny Realm experts found it difficult to resist even a swing of Yang Ye’s sword!

One attack!

At this moment, Yang Ye wasn’t the same Yang Ye he used to be!

The Ordinary Sword!

A short while later, they arrived before a floating city. It was a huge city, and there was a robust man with an axe standing on its walls!

At the same time, a few dozen peak Destiny Realm experts appeared around them!

Moreover, even more auras were rushing over here!

They were surrounded!

Yang Ye slowly sheathed his sword and looked up at the robust man on the city walls. Meanwhile, the man suddenly leaped down, and he slammed his axe at Yang Ye with both hands!

The man used the force of the jump to give his strength a huge boost, and the force of this attack had surpassed the strength of a peak Destiny Realm expert!

Yang Ye gazed at the descending axe with indifference while An Nanjing had moved back a little.

A short while later, the axe grew closer and closer to Yang Ye.

Yang Ye suddenly looked down when it was around 30m away from his head, and then a ray of sword energy shot up into the air.

A resounding and furious shout surged through space, “Break!”

A ray of sword energy slammed against the huge axe. A moment later, the axe shook violently and exploded into bits. At the same time, the robust man was blasted away, but just a moment later, a figure soundlessly appeared behind the man.

It was Yang Ye!

Yang Ye turned around and slashed.

The robust man’s expression changed drastically, and he pressed his arms down toward Yang Ye’s sword!

Boom!

His arms clamped down on Yang Ye’s sword, but it only lasted for an instant!

Yang Ye twisted his right hand, and so did his sword.

Hiss!

The robust man’s arms were instantly chopped off, and then a ray of sword energy flashed through his throat.

Yang Ye sheathed his sword slowly behind the man, and then he gazed at the floating city. A moment later, he flicked his thumb, and his sword shot out of its sheath.

Hiss!

The sword slashed the floating city!

Meanwhile, the experts of the Four Dimensional Universe didn’t try to stop him.

Right when the sword was around 30m away from the city, a man appeared before the sword.

The man slammed a punch at the sword!

Bang!

Yang Ye’s sword was forced to a stop.

Meanwhile, the man slammed his right hand forward.

Bang!

Yang Ye’s sword shook violently, and then it shot swiftly in Yang Ye’s direction.

Yang Ye remained indifferent. The Sword Precursor stopped a few inches away from his forehead. It had stopped on its own!

A moment later, it automatically entered the sheath.

Yang Ye gazed at the man, and the latter spoke softly, “I know why that sword cultivator stopped. It’s because you’re at the Ordinary Sword Realm. The Ordinary Sword, the peak of sword cultivators… How surprising!”

Yang Ye walked slowly in the man’s direction. Suddenly, a shadow appeared behind the man.

Yang Ye frowned slightly. At the same time, the woman in white appeared by Yang Ye’s side.

She spoke softly, “Leave for now!”

Yang Ye’s frown deepened, but he chose to trust her.

Yang Ye gazed at An Nanjing, and the latter nodded slightly. The three of them were about to leave when the man suddenly stretched out his right hand, “This isn’t a place you can just come and go as you place!”

As soon as he said that, he waved his right hand. In an instant, the space around them cracked open, and then a huge pitch black vortex enveloped them.

In the vortex, a strand of mysterious energy was ceaselessly corroding them, and Yang Ye’s sword intent instantly dispersed upon leaving his body!

Yang Ye asked, “What is this?”

The woman in white didn’t speak and just raised her palm. Past Life appeared in her grasp. A moment later, Past Life started spinning rapidly, and then a myriad of rays of sword energy rippled out incessantly.

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!

The entire vortex was filled with sword energy!

Suddenly, a pike tore through the sword energy and arrived before her. She tapped her finger forward, and an ethereal sword slammed against the pike.

The sword instantly cracked apart!

Meanwhile, the woman in white glanced at Yang Ye, “What are you still standing there for?”

Yang Ye returned to his senses. He didn’t use his sword but activated the Sword Domain instead. In an instant, the Sword Domain enveloped the entire vortex.

Yang Ye spoke softly, “Break!”

As soon as he said that, countless rays of sword energy appeared within the Sword Domain, and then the vortex exploded apart.

Suddenly, Monarch Yan appeared before Yang Ye.

Monarch Yan slapped his palm down.

Bang!

In an instant, Yang Ye was pushed back repeatedly while a wisp of blood seeped out from the corner of his mouth.

The Sword Domain had been destroyed!

Monarch Yan appeared before Yang Ye again. At the same time, Yang Ye’s sword suddenly left its sheath.

Monarch Yan slammed a punch forward.

Sword and fist slammed against each other.

Boom!

Yang Ye was pushed back repeatedly again. However, when Monarch Yan attacked again, Yang Ye suddenly pressed forward and slashed.

Explosive Heavenrend!

At the instant he drew his sword, the space in a huge area collapsed!Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Monarch Yan retreated while slowly clenching his left hand. In an instant, an ethereal shield appeared above him.

Yang Ye’s sword struck right against it.

Bang!

This rumbling explosion was like a thunderclap!

Yang Ye’s sword had struck the shield, but it couldn’t break the shield!

The shield had forcibly stopped his attack!

Suddenly, a white shadow flashed, and then Monarch Yan suddenly vanished on the spot. He was 3km away when he appeared again.

The woman in white was in front of Yang Ye.

Yang Ye gazed at Monarch Yan, and his hand was trembling.

He hadn’t expected that even after attaining the Ordinary Sword Realm, he would still be incapable of doing anything to Monarch Yan.

However, it did make sense. After all, he was the master of the Four Dimensional Universe, so he would be dead by now if he wasn’t strong!

The woman in white said, “You leave first.”

Yang Ye shook his head, “We’ll leave together!”

She glanced at Yang Ye, and the latter said, “If we can’t leave, we’ll just have a nice fight with them. What do you think?”

She grinned, “Alright!”

Monarch Yan suddenly raised his right hand, and then he waved it at them from afar.

Under the ground below.

Boom!

A colossus shot up into the sky.

Bang!

Yang Ye and the others were pushed back through the air!

They stopped themselves after being pushed quite a distance, and they saw a colossus appear in the air above the floating city. It was like a dragon, but it wasn't a dragon!

The colossus had the head of a dragon, the body of a wolf, and thousands of spikes on its back. Every spike was extremely long too!

“A Devil Caracal!” The woman in white spoke softly, “It’s the strongest demon beast in the Four Dimensional Universe. It’s on par with Erya!”

“This place is really lively!” Suddenly, a voice came from the side.

Yang Ye looked toward its source and saw a group of people.

He knew them!

It was the mysterious expert and the others from the End World!
