Chapter 1664 - Wait! There’s Something There!

Translator: InVader

Yang Gewu’s eyelids twitched when he heard Yang Ye. He gazed at Yang Ye for a long time before he said, “I didn’t notice that you’re quite shameless.”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

Yang Gewu turned to look at Ku Ming and said, “Ku Ming, can you represent the Ku Clan?”

Ku Ming spoke indifferently, “If they refuse, I’ll fight alone, alright?”

Yang Gewu spoke indifferently, “If you want to fight, I’ll accompany you at any time; if your Ku Clan wants to fight, my Yang Clan will accompany it at any time too.”

“Then bring it on!” As soon as he finished speaking, Ku Ming vanished on the spot.

He was swift! Absolutely swift!

A solemn expression instantly appeared on Yang Ye’s face when he saw Ku Ming attack. Because he hadn’t been able to see Ku Ming’s movements at all!

Ku Ming was strong!

At this moment, both Yang Ye and An Nanjing were far from a match for him.

However, it was normal. Ku Ming had been an extraordinary genius who was ranked on the third position of the Milky Way Rankings. At that time, he’d been able to kill a True Realm expert while at the Half-Step True Realm. Yet now, Ku Ming was at the True Realm. So, it was obvious how strong he would be!

Fighting such a person while at a lower realm of cultivation?

It was difficult! Extremely difficult!

Moreover, Yang Ye was only at the Rebirth Realm, so there was an entire two realms of cultivation between them. It was extremely unrealistic to try and surmount two realms of cultivation to fight Ku Ming! Yang Ye knew his own strength very well. So, he refused to court death!

At the moment Ku Ming vanished, Yang Gewu had vanished as well.

A moment of silence ensued.

Bang!

An explosion resounded like a thunderclap, and then the space in a huge area trembled violently before cracking apart.

Yang Ye was first stunned, and then he was delighted. If the space in such a huge area collapsed, he could take control of the huge black hole it created. At that time, even if he couldn’t kill Ku Ming, he could definitely injure Ku Ming, and he may even be able to heavily injure Ku Ming!

As for Ku Rong and the old man in a luxurious robe, they would definitely lose their lives!

Such a huge black hole wasn’t something a Half-Step True Realm expert could resist!

Right when Yang Ye was looking forward to the collapse of that huge expanse of space, Ku Ming and Yang Gewu suddenly stopped fighting. It didn’t take long for two old men to respectively appear by Ku Ming and Yang Gewu’s side.

The old man by Ku Ming’s side was the Supreme Elder of the Ku Clan, and the second in command in the Ku Clan, Ku Yuxing!

As for the old man by Yang Gewu’s side, it was the Council Master of the Yang Clan’s Council of Elders, Yang Lin!

Ku Yuxing smiled, “Brother Yang Lin, long time no see!” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Yang Lin grinned, “It has been many years. But I didn’t expect us to meet under such circumstances.”

Ku Yuxing nodded slightly, “Indeed.” He paused for a moment and gazed at Yang Ye, “Brother Yang Lin, this junior of yours is very formidable!”

Yang Lin glanced at Yang Ye and said, “The young are hot-blooded and impetuous. Weren’t we the same all those years ago?”

Ku Yuxing replied, “I can understand that. However, everyone must bear the consequences for their actions, right?”

Yang Lin nodded, “Brother Ku, that is true.” He gazed at Yang Ye and continued, “Tell me what you did to make the Ku Clan send three Half-Step True Realm experts to kill you and even send out its guardian.”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and replied, “The Ku Clan has falsely accused me and wants to cause trouble.” Yang Ye described everything that had happened. This time, he hadn’t exaggerated. After all, there were no fools here, so they would only look down upon him if he exaggerated the facts!

A short while passed before Yang Ye said, “That’s what happened. They think I stole their Soul Nurturing Tree, so they wanted to search me, and I agreed to let them do that. But after they finished searching me, they wanted to enter my sea of consciousness and search it as well.”

Yang Lin asked, “Then why did you kill a member of the Ku Clan?!”

Yang Ye spoke in a helpless tone, “I had no other choice. Because I refused to let them search my sea of consciousness, they intended to do it by force. So, that linen robed old man attacked me, and I had no choice but to defend myself. I planned to just stop without killing anyone, but I didn’t expect him to be so weak and die just like that. Of course, he can’t be blamed for that. It’s my fault for being a little too strong!”

The expressions of everyone from the Ku Clan became quite unsightly when they heard Yang Ye. After all, what Yang Ye had said in the end was a heavy slap on the Ku Clan’s face!

“Do you know how to speak?” Meanwhile, Yang Lin berated Yang Ye, “You think you’re very strong? Don’t even think you can do as you please because you have some strength. There are countless experts in this world, and there are innumerable who are stronger than you.”

“Yes! Yes!” Yang Ye hurriedly nodded, and then he moved aside as if he’d learned his lesson.

Yang Lin glanced at Yang Ye, and then he gazed at Ku Yuxing, “Brother Ku, I have a rough understanding of the matter. This junior of mine healed your Soul Nurturing Tree, and then the tree vanished. After that, you thought he had it, so you caused trouble for him. But this junior of mine has said that it isn’t with him.”

Ku Yuxing turned to look at the old man in a luxurious robe, and the old man spoke solemnly, “The Soul Nurturing Tree was exceptionally fond of his profound energy. It wanted to follow him from the very beginning, but we stopped it. However, we hadn’t expected it to actually dig its way through the ground, break open a rift in space, and flee our clan.”

He paused for a moment and continued, “When we chased after it, all we saw was him. So, the Soul Nurturing Tree is definitely in his sea of consciousness. Because we’ve searched his spatial ring, and it isn’t in there. Thus, he has definitely hidden it in his sea of consciousness.”

Ku Yuxing gazed at Yang Ye, and Yang Ye spoke indifferently, “It isn’t in my sea of consciousness.”

Ku Yuxing gazed at Yang Lin, and the latter gazed at Yang Ye, “Is it really not in your sea of consciousness?”

Yang Ye glanced at Ku Yuxing and the others, and he said, “I know that you won’t believe me no matter what I say. So, how about we do this? I’ll allow you to search my sea of consciousness. If you find the Soul Nurturing Tree…”

Yang Lin suddenly said, “If they find it, I’ll kill you myself!”

Yang Ye glanced at Yang Lin. Meanwhile, Yang Lin gazed at Ku Yuxing and said, “But Brother Ku, what if you don’t find it in his sea of consciousness?”

“If we don’t find it…” Ku Yuxing nodded and said, “What do you think, Brother Yang Lin?”

Yang Lin gazed at Yang Ye and asked, “What do you want? The Ku Clan’s treasury is filled with treasures.”

Yang Ye pondered deeply for a moment and asked, “Senior, what do you think I need?”

Yan Lin sized up Yang Ye and said, “Your body is at the Undying Realm, and the next realm is the Zenith Realm. However, it’s probably difficult to attain the Zenith Realm without any extraordinarily fortuitous encounters.”

He paused for a moment at this point, and then he gazed at Ku Yuxing, “According to my knowledge, the Ku Clan seems to have a treasure, the Hell Fruit. Brother Ku, if you don’t find the Soul Nurturing Tree in his sea of consciousness, then can you give him a Hell Fruit?”

Ku Yuxing and the others’ expressions became slightly unsightly when they heard Yang Lin.

The Hell Fruit!

It was no ordinary treasure. Even though it wasn’t at the True Rank, it wasn’t something that any ordinary Zenith Rank treasure could compare to. It was extremely precious even in the Ku Clan.

Meanwhile, Yang Lin suddenly added, “Brother Ku, I’m sure you’ve noticed the potential and natural talent that this junior of mine possesses. As far as my Yang Clan is concerned, even ten Hell Fruits can’t compare to him. However, I know what the Soul Nurturing Tree means for the Ku Clan, so I’m willing to temporarily place his life in your hands.”

He paused for a moment before he continued, “If you find the Soul Nurturing Fruit in his sea of consciousness, there’ll be no need for you to do anything. I’ll kill him myself. However, if you don’t find it, then it isn’t too much to compensate him with a Hell Fruit and give my Yang Clan a proper way out of this situation, right?”

Suddenly, Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and was about to speak, but he stopped when he was just about to say something. Even though the changes in his expression were subtle, the experts from the Ku Clan had noticed it.

Ku Yuxing glanced at Yang Ye, and then he gazed at the old man in a luxurious robe. The latter nodded slightly and was about to speak when Yang Ye suddenly laughed coldly, “The Soul Nurturing Tree really isn’t in my possession. Why don’t you believe me? Seniors from the Ku Clan, I practically never lie, so just believe me this time!”

Ku Yuxing glanced indifferently at Yang Ye, “You practically never lie because you lie all the time, right?”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

Meanwhile, Ku Yuxing gazed at Yang Lin, “Fine, I agree. However, I want to search him myself.”

Yang Lin gazed at Yang Ye and asked, “Do you have any problems with that?”

Yang Ye remained silent.

A cold smile immediately curled up on the corners of the luxurious robed old man’s mouth when he saw Yang Ye fall silent, and Ku Yuxing’s face became calm as well.

At this moment, Yang Ye wasn’t just staying silent, even his profound energy was secretly circulating. At the moment his profound energy started circulating, Yang Lin and Yang Gewu’s expressions had turned gloomy, and the cold smile on the luxurious robed old man’s face grew wider and wider.

Suddenly, Ku Yuxing said, “How about you hand it over yourself, and I’ll give the Yang Clan face and spare your life. However, you have to come back to the Ku Clan with me. Members of my Ku Clan can’t die for nothing, so you have to stay by his grave for 20 years. You…”

“Search me!” Yang Ye spoke abruptly.

Ku Yuxing’s eyes narrowed slightly. He gazed at Yang Ye for a long time, and then he nodded. After that, a strand of his divine sense entered the center of Yang Ye’s forehead.

At this moment, the gazes of everyone here descended upon Yang Ye.

Even though Yang Ye’s expression was calm, he was a little nervous in his heart. Because Ku Yuxing was a True Realm expert. While he was confident in the Primordial Pagoda, he was still a little worried. After all, what if Ku Yuxing noticed something? The situation would get out of control if that happened.

A short while later, Ku Yuxing’s expression gradually became unsightly.

Yang Lin and Yang Gewu’s faces gradually eased up at the sight of this.

Another short while passed, and Ku Yuxing withdrew his divine sense.

Yang Ye was about to speak when Ku Yuxing’s gaze suddenly descended to his abdomen, “Wait! There’s something there!”
