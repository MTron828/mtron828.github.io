Chapter 403 – Formidable Little Girl!

An Biru had left. Under the circumstances that Yang Ye spared no cost to protect her, the little girl had no choice but to let An Biru leave.

An Biru had just left when the figure of the little girl who floated in midair had crashed down towards the ground. Moreover, the glow on scepter in her hand had instantly dimmed down.

Yang Ye was shocked. His figure flashed as he hurried over and caught her in his arms. At this moment, her countenance was ghastly pale, and it made her seem quite shocking.

Yang Ye was just about to speak when a strand of blue light had suddenly erupted from the enormous gem hanging on the little girl’s neck, and then enormous force suddenly erupted from her and instantly blasted onto him. Yang Ye’s mind instantly fell into chaos. What’s wrong with her now?

The little girl’s figure floated up slowly again, and she was around a meter above the ground. The scepter in her hand was glowing faintly, and it was an extremely weak glow that could be overlooked if one didn’t look closely!

Besides that, the little girl’s countenance had become even paler for some unknown reason.

The little girl’s figure floated over to Yang Ye, and then her figure rose slightly before she looked down at Yang Ye who laid on the ground. There was undisguised anger in her eyes as she raised her right hand slowly, and then she knocked Yang Ye’s head lightly with the scepter. She said, “How can you be so weak? Why would that fellow choose such a weak idiot like you? How infuriating!”

As she spoke, she used the scepter to knock Yang Ye on the head a few more times, and then a strand of yellow energy flowed slowly from the scepter into Yang Ye’s body.... Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

After a moment passed, Yang Ye opened his eyes slowly, and the irritable little girl was floating in front of him.

Yang Ye’s face instantly darkened when he saw her. If he wasn’t afraid of the little girl’s terrifying strength, then he would really want to give her a good beating right now. She really deserves a good beating!

Yang Ye forcefully suppressed the rage in his heart and worked hard on calming himself. After a short moment passed, Yang Ye organized his words before he said, “I think that you should know me very well, but I don’t know you at all. So, can you introduce yourself? After all, we’ve been together for so long. What do you think?”

She glanced indifferently at Yang Ye and said, “I know that you really want to beat me right now. Right?”

Yang Ye was speechless.

The little girl’s figure suddenly drifted over to Yang Ye, and then she said, “Do you know? If you dared to hit me upon waking up just now, then you would definitely be dead!”

Yang Ye shrugged and said, “Can we speak normally?”

The little girl stared at Yang Ye for a short while before she said, “Go ahead and ask what you want. But I don’t guarantee that I will answer you!”

The corners of Yang Ye’s mouth twitched. He was really on the verge of being unable to restrain himself from hitting her.

Yang Ye took a deep breath, suppressed those terrifying thoughts that he had, and then he said, “Are you the tiny vortex?”

“No!”

Yang Ye was stunned, and he said with astonishment, “How could that be possible?”

“Why not?” The little girl’s brows knit together slightly, and she spoke with slight displeasure. “Besides that, it isn’t called the tiny vortex!”

“Then what is it called?”

“I won’t tell you!”

The corners of Yang Ye’s mouth twitched again when he heard this. He felt like something was suddenly stuck in his chest, and it was truly an uncomfortable feeling.

After a short while passed, Yang Ye shook his head and smiled before he said, “Then tell me what you can tell me!”

He could be said to have figured out that this little girl wouldn’t tell him anything about her origins and the origins of the tiny vortex.

“Even though you’re very stupid at most times, you have smart moments as well!” The little girl gazed at Yang Ye and nodded lightly while a trace of praise flashed through her eyes. Obviously, she was very pleased by Yang Ye’s frankness.

Yang Ye felt speechless again.

“You’re too weak!” The little girl seemed as if she was exasperated at Yang Ye’s failure to meet her expectations and said, “You’re really too weak. You’re as weak as an ant. It’s fine to be weak, but you just happen to possess so many enemies. Do you know that it’s very easy for you to die if this goes on? It doesn’t really matter if you die because people are dying every day in the end. But your death will harm me, understand?”

Yang Ye shrugged and said, “You’re so formidable, so who can possibly kill you? Moreover, I didn’t force you to stay within me. You can leave at any time if you want!”

Keeping the little girl with him was truly too dangerous because she was so irritable. Actually, it was fine if she was just irritable, but her strength just happened to be shockingly terrifying as well, so he would have to live every day in weak if she stayed with him!

“Do you know that all who dared to speak to me in such a way are dead?” The little girl floated over to look Yang Ye right in the eye, and her voice was indescribably icy cold.

Yang Ye pondered deeply for a moment, and then he said seriously, “Firstly, I’m very grateful for all the help you’ve given me until now. I don’t know about your origins or the origins of the tiny vortex, and I think that you won’t tell me about it as well. I’d like to have a proper conversation with you. After all, there’s definitely a reason why the tiny vortex appeared within me! However, it seems like only I think in that way.”

“That’s because of you, and it has nothing to do with me!” said the little girl in an indifferent tone.

The muscles on Yang Ye’s face twitched. He finally realized that she was even more unreasonable than Bao’er!

Yang Ye shrugged and said, “Alright. Then what do you want now?”

The little girl fell silent, and then a trace of an uncomfortable expression appeared on her face for the first time. After a short time passed, she finally said, “Because of certain reasons, I’m very weak right now and have to heal myself in the tiny vortex you speak of. Moreover, that tiny vortex chose you and only you can fully unlock it. In other words, you understand what I mean, right?”

Yang Ye felt utterly speechless.

“Congratulations! Because of your speed of cultivation that’s like a tortoise, you’ll have the honor of staying by my side for a very long time in the future. Right, you can be my head guard during this period, and you’ll be in charge of my daily life. Eh, what sort of expression is that? Could it be that you don’t feel extremely honored?” The little girl spoke flatly while she seemed as if Yang Ye should be very honored that she’d condescended to let him become her head guard. Moreover, her expression was natural and wasn’t faked at all.

At this moment, Yang Ye finally realized how proud she was!

Yang Ye shook his head and said, “Your strength is that terrifying, so why would you even need me to be your head guard? I would only be a burden to you if you stay with me, right?”

“I told you, I’m injured right now!” The little girl frowned and said, “I can’t stay out here for too long. Moreover, every single time I attack will make me fall into deep slumber for a very long time. Teaching that stupid woman a lesson just now has already exhausted too much of my Divine Energy, so I probably have to sleep for a very long time. I need a constant supply of Primordial... right, the violet profound energy in order to awaken. So, you have to increase your speed of cultivation, understand?”

“How strong are you right now?” asked Yang Ye in a low voice.

“I can kill innumerable people like you!” said the little girl in a flat voice.

Yang Ye’s face was completely dark.

“I hadn’t intended to show myself, but it could be helped because I had to remind you that you must become stronger as soon as possible. Because I can sense that the energy in this world is drying up swiftly. I presume it won’t be long before this world becomes a dead star! You must open the door behind the door within the tiny vortex before that happens. Don’t ask me why because I don’t know how to explain all of that to an idiot like you,” said the little girl.

“I’m sure you’re aware that I have a huge number of enemies, yet my strength is very weak. Could it be that you’re not going to help?” Yang Ye still had a huge amount of questions in his heart, but he knew without a doubt that the little girl didn’t intend to tell him anything for now. Since it was like that, then he could only ask for some benefits. As for those questions, the truth would definitely be revealed in the future.

The little girl shook her head and said, “I’m unable to help you because our methods of cultivation are different. I cultivate Divine Energy while you cultivate Mortal Energy. Moreover, how can you rely on another if you want to become strong? I have to enter into deep sleep. I hope you’re still alive when I awaken again!”

As soon as she finished speaking, the little girl transformed into a strand of light that directly entered Yang Ye’s body!

Yang Ye was stunned on the spot for a short while. That’s all?

Even though he had numerous questions in his mind, he felt fortunate that the mysterious tiny vortex had finally revealed a little bit of itself, and it wasn’t that mysterious anymore.

However, he didn’t know if it was a good or bad thing!

Yang Ye shook his head a short while later. Regardless of whether it was the little girl or the tiny vortex, while they were closely related to him, they weren’t pressing issues right now. The important matters at hand for him were only two things. Reviving Xiao Yuxi and returning to the southern territory to rescue his mother.

As for everything else, he could only put them aside for now....
