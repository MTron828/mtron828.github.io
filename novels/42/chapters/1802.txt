Chapter 1803 – I’m Going To Destroy It!

This sudden turn of events shocked everyone here.

They looked towards the source of the voice, and they saw a woman in a cloud white dress standing there. She seemed to be around the age of 20. Her appearance was picturesque, and her features exquisite. But her peerlessly beautiful face was absolutely cold and unwelcoming. Besides that, she emanated a faint thread of viciousness.

As soon as she appeared here, everyone felt a wave of pressure descend upon them!

Who is she?

Everyone here was puzzled.

Suddenly, the white haired old man from the Ying Clan spoke with a trembling voice, “You… you’re Ancestor Ying Jing?”

The woman glanced at him, “You’re Ying Ke, right?”

The white haired old man’s figure trembled, and then he bowed to her and spoke with excitement, “Ancestor!”

The experts from the Ying Clan were stunned by this, but it didn’t take long for them to bow to her, “Ancestor….”

Ying Jing!

Wu Ye’s expression became extremely unsightly. That wasn’t all, there was even a trace of fear in his eyes.

Ying Jing!

Many in the younger generation had no knowledge of her, but he did. Every clan had extraordinarily monstrous geniuses, the Wu Clan’s extraordinary genius wasn’t its founding ancestor but Wu Mu.

Similarly, the Ying Clan’s extraordinary genius wasn’t its founding ancestor, it was Ying Jing!

Ying Jing was once an extraordinary genius of the Ying Clan, and she was the one who allowed the Ying Clan to become an overlord in the medium universe of the Milky Way System. She was also the one who attacked the mysterious Ku Clan on her own and forced them to summon their ancestor. But she retreated safely in the end.

Ying Jing was a name that once ruled over an era!

Wu Ye hadn’t expected her to appear here!

Yang Lianshuang frowned. Because she’d heard of this name, and it was an existence on par with Wu Mu!

At this moment, the experts of the Ying Clan were overjoyed. Ying Jing had vanished mysteriously all those years ago, and she’d never shown herself since. This made many from the Ying Clan forget her. But they hadn’t expected her to return when the Ying Clan was in a moment of life and death.

The Ying Clan was saved!

Yang Ye gazed at her.

Suddenly, Hou Qing’s voice resounded in Yang Ye’s mind, “Kid, that isn’t her main body. It’s a clone!”

“A clone?” Yang Ye was stunned, “She’s just a clone?”

“It’s not an ordinary clone!” Hou Qing continued, “Her main body is absolutely strong, and this clone isn’t an ordinary clone. It’s at the point where the real and artificial combine. It possesses at least 40% of her main body’s strength. In short, you’re definitely unable to defeat her. Release me right now and I’ll help you deal with her!”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

Meanwhile, Hou Qing said, “Kid, I’m not joking. She really isn’t someone you can resist. Even if she’s just a clone.”

Yang Ye ignored Hou Qing and gazed at Ying Jing. Meanwhile, Ying Jing was looking at him as well, “You want to annihilate my Ying Clan?”

Yang Ye nodded, “Can’t I?”

Ying Jing suddenly waved her hand.

Hiss!

A ray of cold light flashed.

At the same time, Yang Ye raised his sword and swung it.

Boom!

An explosion resounded and Yang Ye was blasted 3km away.

Yang Lianshuang and the others’ expressions became solemn at the sight of this.

Yang Ye wiped off the blood from the corner of his mouth and gazed at Ying Jing, “Just a clone is already so strong. If your main body was here, I would probably have no choice but to run.”

A clone? Everyone here was stunned. She’s actually just a clone? Even her clone is so strong? Then if her main body comes….

Just thinking up to this point caused Yang Lianshuang and the others’ expressions to become unsightly.

Meanwhile, Ying Jing sized up Yang Ye and said, “You’re outstanding indeed. However, not to mention you, it’s impossible even if your Yang Clan’s founding ancestor is reborn.”

She suddenly tapped her finger in Yang Ye’s direction.

Boom!

The space around Yang Ye collapsed. At the same time, numerous rays of cold light crisscrossed through the black hole.

“Attack!” Meanwhile, Yang Lianshuang’s voice resounded, and then all of them charged at Ying Jing.

The experts from the Ying Clan were about to attack, but Ying Jing waved her hand dismissively and stopped them. She gazed at Yang Lianshuang’s group, and then she stretched out her right palm and swept it forward.

A terrifying scene appeared.

A wave of powerful energy swept out. In an instant, the space around Yang Lianshuang and the others was blasted apart into a huge black hole, and the powerful force contained within the attack blasted them over 3km away!

Ying Jing intended to attack again, but a sword howl resounded, and then a ray of sword energy appeared in front of her.

Ying Jing’s remained indifferent as her lips parted, “Fuck off!”

Bang!

A terrifying soundwave rippled from her mouth, and the sword energy was instantly dispersed. As for Yang Ye who was behind it, he was pushed almost 5km away.

As soon as he stopped himself, Ying Jing suddenly clenched her fist in Yang Ye’s direction. In an instant, the space around Yang Ye suddenly pressed down towards him.

Yang Ye’s expression changed, and he issued a command in his heart, causing numerous rays of light to flash. However, they weren’t able to destroy the space around him.

The space around him was getting closer and closer, and the powerful pressure caused Yang Ye to feel like his entire body was being smashed.

Boom!

Suddenly, a strand of flames swept out from Yang Ye, and the space around him was instantly incinerated.

Surprise flashed through Ying Jing’s eyes, “That flame… I’m truly surprised that such a divine flame would actually appear in the medium universe of the Milky Way System!”

Yang Ye stomped his right foot down, and he transformed into a ray of flaming light that vanished on the spot. A moment later, he appeared before Ying Jing, and the flaming light exploded.

Boom!

Countless strands of flaming sword energy enveloped Ying Jing.

The experts from the Ying Clan became visibly anxious when they witnessed this. They’d witnessed the strength of Yang Ye’s flames, and it was simply indescribable. So, could Ying Jing resist it?

Suddenly, the ocean of flames in the distance shook violently, and then a ray of cold light suddenly erupted from it.

Boom!

In an instant, the ocean of flames exploded apart, and countless rays of flaming sword energy shot towards the surroundings. Space was torn apart and obliterated wherever they passed. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Meanwhile, a woman walked out slowly from the remains of the ocean of flame. There were three arm-length rays of cold light coming from her, and they ceaselessly coiled around her. At the same time, cold energy seeped out incessantly from them and pushed back to the flames in the surroundings.

Yang Ye’s pupils constricted slightly. He hadn’t expected that even the Divine Yin Flame wouldn’t be able to injure her.

Moreover, she was just a clone. Even though it was no ordinary clone, it was still a clone!

A monstrous genius!

She deserved to be considered as a monstrous genius that once reigned supreme over an era!

Ying Jing walked slowly in Yang Ye’s direction, “Do you have other trump cards?”

Yang Ye was about to speak when Hou Qing’s voice suddenly resounded in his mind, “Kid, let me out. Let me deal with her or she’ll kill you.”

Yang Ye would naturally not release Hou Qing. Once Hou Qing was released, Hou Qing may not attack Ying Jing and may kill him first instead.

A moment of silence ensued, and then Yang Ye suddenly looked up at her, “This is just a clone of yours. It isn’t your main body. Even if it’s not an ordinary clone, if I’m not wrong, it’s definitely unable to exist here for too long. Right?”

Ying Jing stopped, “The time I have is enough to eliminate you from the face of this universe.”

A ferocious smile curled up on the corners of Yang Ye’s mouth, “I’m going to destroy the Ying Clan today!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye gazed at Yang Lianshuang and the others, “Leave her to me. I’ll leave the rest to all of you!”

Yang Lianshuang asked, “Will you be alright?”

Yang Ye took a deep breath, “I have to!”

He flipped his right palm, and then the flaming wooden sword in his grasp shook violently.

A moment later, Yang Ye stomped his right foot down, and he transformed into a ray of flaming light that shot towards Ying Jing.

At the instant Yang Ye attacked, Yang Lianshuang gazed at the experts from the Ying Clan, “Kill them all!”

As soon as she finished speaking, she led the charge.

Ying Jing’s face turned icy cold when she saw this, “You’re courting death!”

She waved her right hand, and a wave of powerful energy swept towards Yang Ye.

Boom!

The powerful force blasted Yang Ye 3km away. After that, Ying Jing wanted to attack Yang Lianshuang’s group, but Yang Ye transformed into a ray of flaming light that appeared before her. A moment later, countless rays of flaming sword energy shot towards her.

A vicious glow flashed through Ying Jing’s eyes, and she tapped her finger forward.

Bang!

A wave of powerful energy blasted the flaming sword energy away. However, her expression suddenly changed at this moment, and her eyes were filled with disbelief…
