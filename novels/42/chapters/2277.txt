Chapter 2278 – The Initial Emperor!

Yang Ye put his sword away and left.

Actually, Yang Ye had wanted to exchange a few blows with him. He wanted to take a look at Jian Kan’s attainments in the Sword Dao. However, just as he’d said, he didn’t want to waste time right now.

One attack!

An ultimate attack!

His true ultimate move right now wasn’t any external source of strength, it was his Sword Domain. The Sword Domain combined with peak Progenitor Realm slaughter intent. Not to mention Progenitor Realm experts, he could even kill True Dao Realm experts! After all, he was at the Progenitor Realm now.

His current strength had undergone a qualitative leap when compared to before!

Not long after Yang Ye left, a middle aged man appeared where Yang Ye had been.

The middle aged man glanced at Jian Kan’s body, fell silent for an instant, and then closed his eyes slowly. He spoke via voice transmission, “We underestimated him. Jian Kan was killed in an instant. He may be at the Progenitor Realm, but his strength is at the True Dao Realm.”

A long time passed before a voice resounded in the middle aged man’s voice, “Give up!”

The middle aged man thought for a moment and said, “Sect Master, if you and the Grand Elder join forces, he wouldn’t be able to resist them at all. If our Divine Martial Sect obtains those three treasures, we…”

“You’re mistaken!” The voice resounded abruptly and interrupted him, “Those treasures may be precious, but if we must pay a price that’s too huge, it’s best to not get them. He possesses such strength at his age, he’s an outstanding genius. Moreover, he has those three treasures, so he possesses great karmic luck too. If we fail to kill him, he’ll become a great enemy of our Divine Martial Sect. We still have time to stop now.”

The middle aged man fell silent for a long time and said, “What about revenge for Jian Kan…”

The voice replied, “It’s my fault for underestimating his strength. I will take responsibility for Jian Kan’s death!”

The middle aged man’s expression changed slightly, and he hurriedly bowed, “That was not my intention!”

The voice said, “Bei Yu, I know you two were close, but I hope you put the sect’s interests first. I’ve taken a look at that kid. His foundation is solid, possesses the Sword Domain, and his mastery of the Sword Domain is horrifying even to me. Even if I join forces with the Grand Elder, we may not be able to kill him. Especially when his Dao is a Dao of slaughter. It’s a path that only few have ever taken! If we fail to kill him, our Divine Martial Sect will be annihilated by him in the future. So, don’t go looking for revenge from him, don’t get yourself killed.”

Bei Yu bowed, “I understand! It’s just a pity because if our Divine Martial Sect can obtain those treasures, we’ll definitely be able to transcend above the other two sects!”

The voice replied, “It’s luck if we obtain it, fate if we lose it. It’s not a pity at all. Return to the sect!”

“Understood!” Bei YU bowed slightly and vanished on the spot.

Right after Bei Yu vanished, a ray of light appeared here, and it dispersed to reveal Yang Ye’s figure.

Actually, he hadn’t left.

Suddenly, a voice resounded in Yang Ye’s ear, “Please do as you wish.”

Yang Ye closed his eyes slowly, and the slaughter intent around him dispersed by quite a bit. A short while later, he vanished on the spot.

Some distance away, a string of cold sweat appeared on Bei Yu’s face for some reason.

…

Yang Ye shot through the clouds on his sword. Around two hours later, Yang Ye suddenly looked down. He hesitated for a moment, and then he suddenly changed his direction and shot down.

A ray of light descended and Yang Ye appeared before an ancient city.

The city was huge, and its walls were extremely tall. It felt like an ant to stand before the city. The city was not constructed with rocks, it was constructed with swords!

A city of swords, a city made of swords.

There were three pitch black words above the city’s entrance—Sword Sky City!

Sword Sky City?

A wisp of surprise flashed through Yang Ye’s eyes. It was the first time he’d seen a city made of swords. Besides that, he sensed extremely strong sword intent coming from within the city.

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and walked over to the city’s entrance, and it only took a moment for him to arrive before it. At the instant he passed through the entrance, a huge rock on the right of the entrance trembled, and then a sword howl resounded.

Yang Ye was puzzled, and surprise filled his eyes.

Meanwhile, a young man appeared before him. The young man sized up Yang Ye and said, “You’re a sword cultivator?”

Yang Ye nodded.

The young man glanced at the huge rock. At this moment, a strand of red light had appeared on it, and it was growing brighter and brighter before gradually turning purple.

The young man’s expression instantly changed at the sight of this, and he gazed at Yang Ye and bowed, “Sword Sky City welcomes your arrival, Senior!” Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Yang Ye was stunned and gazed at the huge rock, “What is that?”

“An intent measurement stone!” The young man spoke respectfully, “It’s my Sword Sky City’s intent measurement stone. It can sense sword intent. The stronger the sword intent, the greater it reacts. It turned purple, and that represents your sword intent is in the Progenitor Realm!”

Yang Ye shook his head, “You’re wrong. I don’t have sword intent anymore!”

His slaughter intent had recovered, and it had even grown stronger. But his sword intent… It was quite amusing that a sword cultivator like him had slaughter intent which was stronger than his sword intent.

The young man was stunned and said, “Impossible. The intent measurement stone is never wrong. Senior, you…”

Yang Ye smiled and didn’t say anything. He entered the city, and then he seemed to have thought of something and stopped abruptly. He gazed at the young man, “I have a question.”

The young man hurriedly walked over to Yang Ye, “Please go ahead, Senior.”

Yang Ye asked, “Do you know about the Shiyuan Clan?”

“The Shiyuan Clan!” The young man nodded slightly, “It’s one of the six clans. I do know a little about it. What would you like to know?”

Yang Ye said, “How many True Dao Realm experts do they possess?” He had to go there, but he had to gain an understanding of their strength before he did.

The young man thought for a moment and said, “I don’t know the exact number of True Dao Realm experts they possess. But they have three who are comparatively famous. One of them is Ling Xu who just attained the True Dao Realm. He’s an extraordinary genius of the Shiyuan Clan. He was quite famous in Eternal Border even before he attained the True Dao Realm.”

He paused for a moment and continued, “The second is the patriarch of the Shiyuan Clan, Shiyuan Xing. He’s the current patriarch of the Shiyuan Clan, and he attained the True Dao Realm many years ago. Now, he’s probably even stronger.”

Yang Ye asked, “What about the third?”

The man spoke solemnly, “He’s the previous patriarch of the Shiyuan Clan, the Initial Emperor. It was he who led the Shiyuan Clan out of the large universe to Eternal Border. The Shiyuan Clan was extremely weak when they just arrived, and if it wasn’t for him, they wouldn’t have been able to gain a foothold in Eternal Border at all. His strength is unfathomable!”

Unfathomable!

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly. Based on what the young man had said, the Initial Emperor was probably the strongest in the Shiyuan Clan. But besides the Initial Emperor, the Shiyuan Clan had two True Dao Realm experts just on the surface!

What about in secret?

Yang Ye remained calm on the outside, but no one knew what he was thinking.

Meanwhile, the young man hesitated for a moment and said, “Senior, do you have enmity with the Shiyuan Clan?”

Yang Ye gazed at the young man with slight surprise in his eyes, “How did you know?”

The young man replied, “I sensed the slaughter intent in your sword intent.” He hesitated for a moment and continued, “Your sword intent seems to contain slaughter intent. Senior, your Sword Dao is really, really unusual!”

Yang Ye sized up the young man and smiled, “You’re not bad yourself.”

He wasn’t just being courteous. The young man may be just at the Sage Realm, but his sword intent was extremely sharp. It was like a precious sword that had just been unsealed. While the young man had tried his best to conceal it, he could still sense the sharpness of it!

It could be said that while the young man was merely at the Sage Realm, his combat strength was probably comparable with some Progenitor Realm experts!

Sword cultivators were usually stronger than ordinary cultivators!

The young man grinned when he heard Yang Ye, “Senior, I have a request!”

Yang Ye said, “Go on!”

The young man bowed to Yang Ye, “Please provide me with your guidance!”

Guidance!

Yang Ye sized up the young man and a wisp of admiration flashed through his eyes. While the young man was extremely humble and very respectful to Yang Ye, the young man had no fear!

It was alright to be respectful to the strong, but one couldn’t be fearful of the strong!

The young man’s attainments in the Sword Dao and heart toward the Sword Dao was much better than he’d expected!

Yang Ye didn’t refuse this request and nodded, “Alright!”

The young man bowed again, “Thank you!”

He glanced at the surroundings and said, “We can’t fight here, so please come with me!”

The young man walked toward the city.

Yang Ye followed the young man, and it didn’t take long for them to arrive in a mountain range.

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings. There were three main peaks in this mountain range in the shape of a triangle. Each was taller than the other, and a huge towering sword floated on all three of the peaks.

When Yang Ye looked carefully at them, his expression gradually became solemn.

All three of them weren’t ordinary treasures!

It could be said that they may not be any inferior to his Sword Supreme and Sword Precursor!

Sword Sky City!

Just these three huge swords allowed Yang Ye to realize how strong and extraordinary Sword Sky City was! Besides that, there were two sword intents on the highest peak that even made his heart palpitate slightly!

His heart was palpitating!

It had been very, very long since he’d encountered sword intent that could make him sense danger.

The young man led Yang Ye to the lowest peak. Or to be more precise, a bamboo forest on the lowest peak!

It was no ordinary bamboo forest. There was a formation around it!

The young man stopped, turned around, and bowed to Yang Ye, “Senior, this is the Sword Bamboo Forest. The bamboo here were personally grown by our founding ancestor, and they contain his sword intent and will in the Sword Dao. If we spar here, all the sword intent we emanate will be suppressed by these bamboos, so our sword energy and sword intent won’t leak out or damage the space in the surroundings. We can fight here to our hearts’ content!”

He bowed to Yang Ye again and continued, “I request that you use your full strength and don’t hold back. Thank you!”

Yang Ye glanced at the young man, “Are you sure?”

The young man nodded and spoke firmly, “Of course!”

Yang Ye fell silent for an instant and nodded, “Make your move!”

“Senior, please make your move!” The young man continued, “My Sword Dao is one that reacts to my opponent and strikes at the weak point. So, I’ll be stronger if I attack after you!”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and nodded, “Alright!”

A sword suddenly appeared in Yang Ye’s grasp, and then Yang Ye instantly appeared before the young man.

A sword howl suddenly surged up into the sky.

The Sword Domain!

Yang Ye didn’t hold back and used the Sword Domain immediately!

As soon as he used the Sword Domain…

Bang!

The bamboo forest in the surroundings trembled, and then they exploded apart and were obliterated!

In a bamboo house at the main peak of Sword Sky City, an old man who was seated cross-legged on a bamboo bed suddenly opened his eyes, and his eyes were filled with disbelief, “My Sword Sky City has such a genius?”

At the same time, sword howls resounded throughout the city. In an instant, all of them shot toward the bamboo forest.

It was quite a magnificent scene to behold!
