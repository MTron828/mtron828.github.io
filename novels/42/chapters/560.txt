Chapter 561 – Visitors From The Mo Clan

The three of them didn’t do anything in the world within the pagoda. Su Qingshi was pregnant, so Yang Ye wouldn’t touch her regardless of how ‘thirsty’ he was. On the other hand, it was impossible for anything to occur between Yang Ye and Xiao Yuxi because of Su Qingshi’s presence. The three of them just played around within the pagoda for a while before leaving it. Because the reinforcements Yang Ye spoke of had arrived at the Sword Sect!

Sky Hall.

Yang Ye had just entered Sky Hall when he saw a few familiar figures. It was Shu Xin from the Treant Clan, Lu Jianyao who’d returned to Ancient Domain City earlier, and Ding Shaoyao who’d entered into conflict with him the last time they’d met. This was quite surprising to Yang Ye because he’d only expected Ancient Domain City and the Treant Clan!

“Young Master Yang, we meet again!” Ding Shaoyao smiled.

“I never expected that Miss Ding would have come as well!” Yang Ye nodded lightly while he smiled.

Ding Shaoyao said, “I wasn’t the only one who came today. I heard the Sword Sect was in danger, so how could my Ding Clan stand by idly when we’re allies with Young Master Yang? So, I brought all the Exalt Realm experts of my Ding Clan with me. There is a total of 107 Exalt Realm experts, and 40 of them are at the fifth rank or above. I hope they’ll be of help to Young Master Yang!”

Yang Ye was visibly moved. He hadn’t expected that Ding Shaoyao would actually bring all the Exalt Realm experts of the Ding Clan. This displayed that she intended to bind her Ding Clan with him! Yang Ye instantly came to an understanding upon giving it a little thought. He realized that she was probably aware about him possessing a master at the Half-Saint Realm. Otherwise, it was absolutely impossible for Ding Shaoyao to act in this way!

“Thank you for the assistance, Miss Ding!” said Yang Ye.

“It’s only something that I should do!” Ding Shaoyao smiled before she moved to the side, and then her gaze descended onto Su Qingshi and Xiao Yuxi. She glanced at the two of them, glanced at Yang Ye, and seemed to be lost in thought.

“My City Governor’s Estate of Ancient Domain City brought a huge gift for you this time!” Lu Jianyao smiled. “My Ancient God City annihilated all the forces of the Souleater Corps while you were at the Sword Sect. Besides the two An Clans, all other powers related to Luo Jun within Ancient Domain City have been wiped out!”

The expressions of everyone here changed, and it even included Yang Ye. They’d experienced the strength of the Souleater Corps, so it surprised them that the City Governor’s Estate was actually capable of annihilating 90,000 members of the Souleater Corps in such a short period! Moreover, except the two An Clans, it had even eliminated all the other powers in Ancient Domain City which were related to Luo Jun....

Yang Ye said in his heart, Looks like I underestimated the City Governor’s Estate a little!

Lu Jianyao continued. “I came here today with 100 Exalt Realm experts which my father ordered me to bring over, and 60 of them are at the fifth rank or above. My father said that the agreement between the two of you came into effect when you obtained the World Portrait, and it will be in effect for eternity as long as you don’t go back on your word!” DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“I never betray those who don’t betray me,” said Yang Ye.

Lu Jianyao smiled. “That’s exactly what I told my father!”

Yang Ye nodded. Meanwhile, Shu Xin said, “Young Master Yang, all the members of my Treant Clan have settled down in the mountains around the Sword Sect. Perhaps they might be quite weak in terms of offensive strength, but their defensive capabilities will definitely not disappoint you. Unless a Monarch Realm expert acts against them, otherwise, even a thousand Exalt Realm experts wouldn’t be a problem for us!”

“Thank you!” said Yang Ye.

Shu Xin smiled. “My Treant Clan is bound to you now, so there’s no need to be courteous!”

Yang Ye nodded, and then he gazed at Ding Shaoyao and said, “Miss Ding, you’re the best at tricks and schemes amongst us all. So, do you think we should be on the offensive or defensive right now?”

Ding Shaoyao rolled her eyes at Yang Ye and said, “I’ve done some investigating. The Origin School has around 100 plus Exalt Realm experts, the Flower Palace is slightly weaker but only has around 70 plus left after it suffered heavy losses, and the Ghost Sect has around 80 as well. As for the Brightmoon Sect, it only has around 50 plus. In overall, the amount of Exalt Realm experts they possess surpasses our forces, but we have that divine gold dragon, and it’s sufficient to make up for the difference!”

“So you’re saying that we should go on the offensive?” said Yang Ye.

Ding Shaoyao shook her head and said, “That would have been the case, but the plan has to be changed now.”

“Why?” Yang Ye was puzzled.

Ding Shaoyao’s expression became slightly serious as she said, “You should have heard about the Exalted Han Empire possessing a group made completely out of Exalt Realm experts, right?”

Yang Ye frowned and said, “Luo Jun has dispatched that group?”

Ding Shaoyao said, “Not all. He only dispatched 3,000 Exalt Realm experts, and there are a thousand amongst them who are at the fifth rank or above! Moreover, it’s a well known general of the Exalted Han Empire who’ll be leading the troops, Zhao Zhangfei. It’s that fellow who just conquered the entire eastern territory. He is only at the fifth rank of the Exalt Realm, but he’s extremely skilled in commanding his troops, and he’s even able to raise the spirits of his troops. In other words, he can raise their morale to improve their strength, so facing him is like facing an army!”

Yang Ye took a deep and long glance at Ding Shaoyao before he said, “Since you knew that the Exalted Han Empire had dispatched such a formidable army, then why did you still come to the southern territory to help me?”

“Isn’t it better to offer timely assistance in a time of need instead of trying to improve the strength of a mighty titan?” Ding Shaoyao smiled.

“I’ll remember this kindness!” said Yang Ye.

Ding Shaoyao smiled and continued. “The Grand Qin Empire and Darkbeast Empire will definitely assist us. However, we’ll be attacking sects and not cities, so their armies would be quite insignificant. Only their experts at the Spirit Realm and Exalt Realm would be of use to us. However, even if we include the Exalt Realm experts of both empires, the amount of Exalt Realm experts we possess is still too few when compared to the Exalted Han Empire and all of those sects!”

“That is a problem!” Yang Ye frowned. He was quite confident in his ability to annihilate a few dozen Exalt Realm experts by joining forces with the divine gold dragon, but it was only limited to ordinary Exalt Realm experts. However, the Exalt Realm experts from the Exalted Han Empire were definitely far from ordinary, and their numbers were so huge as well. Not to mention anything, just a few spatial cages would be sufficient to trap both him and the divine gold dragon completely!

“There’s another problem!” Ding Shaoyao said, “We’ve been only speaking about Exalt Realm experts. After all, there’s the Monarch Realm above the Exalt Realm. Perhaps the Monarch Realm experts of the Exalted Han Empire and those sects wouldn’t attack Yang Ye, but what if they attack us?”

“They wouldn’t dare!” Yang Ye said, “Luo Jun wouldn’t dare take that risk. Because once he uses Monarch Realm experts, then the Demon Emperor and my master would definitely act as well. Once experts of that level join the fight, then it wouldn’t just be a fight to seize territory, and it could even destroy the continent. That isn’t something he wishes to see!”

Ding Shaoyao thought for a moment before she said, “I overlooked that!”

“The Mo Clan’s Patriarch, Mo Xinyu, has come to pay a visit to the Sect Master of the Sword Sect!” Right at this moment, a sonorous voice resounded from the horizon.

“The Mo Clan?” Yang Ye’s brows knit together once more.
