Chapter 1270 – One Down!

The black robed old man’s pupils constricted because he saw Yang Ye shooting towards him.

At this moment, he realized that Yang Ye’s target had never been the grey robed man, it was him! Everything Yang Ye had done before this had been in preparation for this moment.

He wanted to dodge away, but it was utterly impossible. Because he’d raised his speed to its limits to help the grey robed old man. Under such circumstances, how could he possibly stop him? Of course, he could naturally stop himself if he was given some time, but Yang Ye would definitely not give him that time. Moreover, Yang Ye’s speed was at his limits as well.

In just an instant, the black robed old man understood that the only way to survive was to go head-on against Yang Ye!

In an encounter on a narrow path, only the brave would survive!

A wisp of ferocity flashed through the black robed old man’s eyes, and the profound energy within him surged out madly. In the end, all the profound energy surged into the spear in his left grasp, and then he stabbed it at Yang Ye. If he had enough time, he would definitely not execute such an ordinary attack. Yet now, how could he have the time?

Their speed was at their limits, and they both attacked with their full strength!

At the moment the black robed old man attacked, the Sword God’s Seal on Yang Ye’s forehead lit up. In an instant, the blood red sword in his grasp started trembling violently.

It didn’t take long for the spear and sword to collide!

Hiss!

There was no loud explosion and rumbling. The grey robed old man watched with astonishment from afar as Yang Ye’s sword stabbed through the tip of the black robed old man’s spear.

A moment later, the spear was stabbed into 2, and Yang Ye had appeared behind the black robed old man.

The black robed old man’s figure stiffened while a dazed expression could be seen in his eyes, “How... how swift!”

Hiss!

As soon as he finished speaking, blood sprayed out like a fountain from the center of his forehead, and then his body was like a leaking ball. Countless strands of profound energy surged out from within him. But it didn’t take long for Yang Ye to wave his hand and put the black robed old man’s corpse away.

Meanwhile, the grey robed old man gazed at Yang Ye with astonishment. Besides astonishment, there was a trace of fear in his eyes.

A Voider had been killed! Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

A Quasi Emperor had killed a Voider!

Even though he knew Yang Ye had the strength to kill Voiders, he was still shocked when he witnessed it himself. Moreover, Yang Ye had accomplished the kill while fighting 3 Voiders on his own. While Yang Ye had used a scheme to succeed, he was still facing 3 Voiders!

3 Voiders in a battle against a single Quasi Emperor had actually lost one of their companions!

What kind of monstrous genius is he? The grey robed old man had no intention to retreat in his heart; his heart was filled with killing intent instead. Yang Ye must die! He must die! If he doesn’t die and is allowed to grow, then he’ll be a calamity for my Yuan Clan!

Meanwhile, once Yang Ye put the black robed old man’s corpse away, he withdrew a few violet crystals and tossed them into his mouth. After that, he gazed at the grey robed old man who was still shocked and smiled, “Are you thinking that I must die after you witnessed me kill a Voider. Because I’ll definitely be a threat to your Yuan Clan if I’m allowed to live?”

The grey robed old man tightened his grasp on the saber in his right hand, and his nerves tensed. He didn’t dare to be careless in the slightest now. Because only 2 of them remained now. His objective now wasn’t to fight Yang Ye but to buy time until the experts of the Veiled Region arrived.

Yang Ye didn’t attack. After all, he’d just used the Sword God’s Seal and the ultimate version of Death by a Thought, so there was less than 10% of profound energy left within him. Besides being a waste of profound energy, attacking now was completely pointless. After all, the grey robed old man was fully on guard, so it wasn’t realistic to try and use Death by a Thought to kill the old man!

Moreover, the successive battles he’d experienced had caused his body to suffer some damage. While it wasn’t severe, it wasn’t minor either!

Actually, it was all thanks to his cultivation in body refinement. Because his formidable cultivation of the body made it so that it was difficult for the attacks of Voiders to cause lethal harm to him. Coupled with his extraordinary recovery, it could be said that unless he was annihilated in an instant or crippled, even suffering 100 attacks could only be considered as minor injuries while they didn’t strike any lethal points on him!

Because his recovery was so swift, and his ability to take hits was great as well!

Yang Ye held the blood red sword as he gazed at the grey robed old man in silence. The grey robed old man was looking at him as well, and his eyes were filled with vigilance. The old man didn’t speak as well. All 3 of the experts here remained silent, and the atmosphere here instantly became heavy.

It felt like the calm before a storm!

Time trickled by. Around 15 minutes later, Yang Ye suddenly said, “Since you refuse to attack, then I’m leaving.”

Yang Ye turned around and started walking away.

“Stop right there!” Meanwhile, the grey robed old man roared with fury. How could he possibly let Yang Ye leave? If Yang Ye were to leave, it would be like releasing a tiger into the mountains!

Yang Ye stopped. A moment later, he turned around and swung his sword at the grey robed old man.

The corners of the grey robed old man’s eyes twitched at the sight of this. But he’d been on guard since the beginning. He immediately grasped his saber with both hands and swung it.

A ray of snow white saber energy tore through space as it chopped down at Yang Ye. This attack was extremely powerful. Obviously, the grey robed old man had been gathering his strength for a long time.

Yang Ye’s expression remained the same as he swung his sword against the saber energy.

Hiss!

The saber energy was instantly slashed into 2. Meanwhile, the grey robed old man suddenly appeared in front of Yang Ye, and then the saber carried a strand of unparalleled force as it slashed down towards Yang Ye’s head. At the same time, a dagger suddenly appeared behind Yang Ye.

This time, Yang Ye didn’t use the Phantom Shield to stop the dagger. The Phantom Shield appeared above his head to stop the saber, whereas he turned around and swung Heaven’s Gravestone with both hands.

Hiss!

Yang Ye’s attack struck nothing but air. Because the dagger and the mysterious Voider had vanished.

Yang Ye’s face fell. Because the mysterious assassin had learned from her past mistakes, and she immediately vanished upon failing to strike him. She absolutely refused to go head-on against him. It made sense because not to mention a human, even Voider Realm demon beasts wouldn’t dare to go head-on against him. After all, he possessed a body at the Epoch Realm and a Void Rank sword of slaughter!

As soon as his attack missed, Yang Ye paid no further attention to the assassin. He turned around and flicked his sword at the grey robed old man instead.

However, right when he swung his sword at the old man, the dagger which had just vanished had suddenly appeared behind him again. This time, it didn’t sweep towards his head, and it was descending towards his back instead. Obviously, the assassin felt that it was the best position to strike!

Yang Ye’s face turned utterly gloomy when he noticed the dagger behind him. That fellow just won’t leave me alone!
