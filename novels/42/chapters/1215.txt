Chapter 1216 – Fighting 10 Emperors On His Own!

The Void Rank!

All the Emperors gazed at Yang Ye with astonishment. Besides astonishment, there was disbelief in their eyes!

The Void Rank was the rank above the Emperor Rank. Such treasures that existed throughout the continent could be counted with a single hand! They’d never imagined that Yang Ye actually possessed such a divine treasure.

The experts from the World Devastator Cult and the other powers became extremely unsightly.

Yang Ye clenched his right hand and a blood red sword appeared in his grasp. As soon as he grabbed it, a blood red ray of light arose from his feet and enveloped his figure. At the same time, a terrifying wave of baleful energy and slaughter intent instantly surged out from him and swept towards the Emperors of the World Devastator Cult and the other powers!

“Kill!” Yang Ye’s furious voice resounded from within the blood red light, and a blood red ray of light flashed forward at practically the exact same instant.

Hiss!

Xiao Tian’s figure stiffened on the spot as a strand of blood sprayed from the center of his forehead. His eyes were opened wide, and they were filled with disbelief and terror even until the moment of his death. He hadn’t expected a dignified Sect Master like himself to be instantly killed by a Saint. Moreover, he didn’t even have the ability to fight back!

He’d died with everlasting regret!

In an instant, Xiao Tian’s body vanished on the spot, and then another blood red ray of light flashed just a moment later.

Hiss!

An Emperor from the Darkwater Sect suffered the same fate as Xiao Tian. A strand of blood sprayed from the center of his forehead while Yang Ye who was enveloped by blood red light had appeared behind him. An instant later, that Emperor’s corpse vanished on the spot as well.

Meanwhile, the others finally recovered from their shock!

One of the blue robed old men from the World Devastator Cult roared with fury, “Join forces and kill him! Kill him!”

The Emperors here shot towards Yang Ye. The Emperors on the Sword Alliance’s side didn’t stand by idly, and they attacked at the same time.

The World Devastator Cult’s group had just arrived in front of Yang Ye when a wave of blood red sword energy swept out horizontally from where Yang Ye stood.

They were shocked when they saw the sword energy, and they flashed backwards successively and didn’t dare to go head-on against it. Some of them hadn’t been able to dodge in time, so they had no choice but to face it head-on.

Rumble!

Many Emperors were blasted backwards by the wave of blood red sword energy while 2 were almost slashed into 2. Besides that, 2 other Emperors had their arms chopped into 2. If they hadn’t moved away in time, their entire bodies would have probably been split into 2.

The experts from the World Devastator Cult were extremely shocked when they witnessed this scene!

That’s a Saint? A Saint?It wasn’t just the experts of the World Devastator Cult who were stunned, even Jian Xu and the others were shocked. Because even if Yang Ye was holding a Void Rank sword, it didn’t make sense for him to be that strong!

After Heaven’s Gravestone had absorbed the killing intent and baleful energy left behind by Jian Wuji on Godfall Mountain, it had advanced into the Void Rank. Since its quality had improved, its strength had naturally grown immensely as well. Even though it hadn’t allowed Yang Ye’s slaughter intent to rise to the Rebirth Realm, Heaven’s Gravestone still carried Jian Wuji’s killing intent and baleful energy from all those years ago!

After all, even Emperors didn’t dare to get close to the killing intent and baleful energy on Godfall Mountain! Moreover, even Heaven’s Gravestone which was at the Emperor Rank at the time hadn’t been able to subdue the killing intent and baleful energy there. It was obvious how terrifying it was. Yet now, Yang Ye had taken control of it!

The slaughter intent and baleful energy within Heaven’s Gravestone was already capable of posing a threat to Emperors. Now, it had Jian Wuji’s killing intent and baleful energy, so its might had naturally multiplied. Moreover, it was even enhanced by Yang Ye’s Rebirth Realm sword intent. So how terrifying would it be? It could be said that Yang Ye could kill Emperors with a casual swing of his sword even without the ultimate version of Death by a Thought!

Ray after ray of blood red light surged out from below Yang Ye’s feet, and it obstructed the vision of the others, causing them to be unable to see how Yang Ye was at this moment. However, they could sense his intent to kill. Especially the experts of the World Devastator Cult, Yang Ye’s slaughter intent and baleful energy had never left them!

“Kill!” Suddenly, Yang Ye’s voice resounded from within the red light, and his figure transformed into a thread of blood that vanished on the spot. At the same time that Yang Ye vanished, the hairs of all the experts from the World Devastator Cult instantly stood on end. Many Emperors here hadn’t even been able to react before a strand of blood sprayed from the center of the forehead of a blue robed old man.

It was an instant kill!

An absolutely instant kill!

“Kill! Kill him! Don’t hold back!” One of the Emperors from the World Devastator Cult roared hysterically.

However, he’d just finished speaking when a ray of blood red light shot towards him, and it horrified him. Fortunately, he was prepared, and his head moved slightly to the side when it appeared before him.

Hiss!

Half of his face was sliced off and blood flowed out like a fountain!

Meanwhile, the other Emperors attacked in succession. Countless energy palms and fists were accompanied by all sorts of techniques as they covered the sky and descended upon Yang Ye.

How terrifying was the joint attacks of over 20 Emperors?

The space throughout the area outside Doomsday City had cracked apart while Jian Xu and the others’ expressions changed. Yang Ye’s slaughter had incurred the fury of those Emperors!

“Attack!” As soon as Jian Xu finished speaking, he, Yang Ye’s Sword Servants, and the other Emperors from Violet Thistle City charged at the experts from the World Devastator Cult.

Ray after ray of blood red sword energy swept out from the blood red light that enveloped Yang Ye. Every single one of those rays of sword energy was extremely terrifying, and even Emperors didn’t dare go head-on against them and had no choice but to dodge.

The battle was extremely intense.

Even though Yang Ye was extremely terrifying, the experts from the World Devastator Cult and the other powers were mentally prepared now. So, Yang Ye wasn’t able to kill them in an instant like he had before this. Because around 10 Emperors were besieging Yang Ye. So long as he attacked, he would have to face the joint attacks of 10 Emperors! However, because Yang Ye was keeping them busy, the Sword Alliance which had been at a disadvantage was slowly gaining the advantage.

As for those 10 Emperors who’d surrounded Yang Ye, they had extremely solemn expressions on their faces. All of them seemed like they were facing a formidable enemy, and they didn’t dare slack off at all. After all, the blood red sword energy was too terrifying! Unless they utilized Emperor Rank defensive treasures, they didn’t dare go head-on against it! Because they couldn’t resist it at all! Anyone who faced Yang Ye’s sword energy would die!

“Kill!” Suddenly, over 20 rays of light suddenly shot into the sky from within Doomsday City, and they charged towards the experts from the World Devastator Cult.

It was Qin Zhuyao and the others!

Qin Zhuyao and the others hadn’t joined the battle before this because the gap in strength between the 2 sides was too huge. They would just be giving their lives away if they joined the battle. Yet now, the Sword Alliance had the upper hand, so they could keep at least 2 or 3 Emperors busy! In that way, the Sword Alliance would gain a greater advantage over their enemies. Most importantly, they wanted to strive to create an opportunity for Yang Ye!

What opportunity? An opportunity to escape the encirclement of those 10 Emperors!

Qin Zhuyao and the others’ targets were those 10 Emperors who’d encircled Yang Ye. Sure enough, the faces of those 10 Emperors had changed when Qin Zhuyao’s group shot up into the air. It didn’t take long for one of them to leave the group and meet Qin Zhuyao’s group in battle. As far as they were concerned, it was just a bunch of ants at the Quasi Emperor Realm, so just a single Emperor would be sufficient!

But it didn’t take long for them to regret that decision!

Because that Emperor hadn’t even lasted for 10 minutes before he was killed beneath the joint forces of over 20 Sword cultivators!

“Kill!” Qin Zhuyao shouted, and then their group charged forward once more at the other 9 Emperors around Yang Ye.

“I’m here as well!” Meanwhile, a familiar voice resounded from afar, and then a ray of light arrived here.

Dugu Jian!

It was Dugu Jian!

Huan Kong glanced at Dugu Jian and said, “Thick Skinned Dugu! Nice! I wasn’t wrong about you! Kill them!”

As soon as he finished speaking, all of them continued their charge towards those 9 Emperors.

This time, those 9 Emperors didn’t dare act carelessly at all. They sent 3 Emperors to fight Dugu Jian and the others.

However, as soon as those 3 Emperors left, the expressions of the remaining 6 instantly changed drastically, and one of them hurriedly shouted, “Come back here!”

Hiss!

He’d just finished speaking when a blood red ray of sword energy suddenly shot through the center of his forehead. The sword energy didn’t vanish, and it came out the other side of the Emperor’s head while accompanied by a string of blood and vanished into the horizon.

“Flee!” Meanwhile, Li Canghai, who was one of the Emperors that were surrounding Yang Ye, hadn’t hesitated to lead the other Emperors of the Darkwater Sect away and flee. When Xue Mei saw Li Canghai leave, he hesitated for a moment before giving the order to the experts from Frostwind City, “Let’s go!”

At this moment, Yang Ye was absolutely monstrous. Staying behind here would be no different than burying all the experts of their respective powers. They were no fools, so they naturally fled.

“Get back here!” One of the experts from the World Devastator Cult roared with fury, but no one paid attention to him!

It didn’t take long for the experts of the Darkwater Sect and Frostwind City to withdraw from the battle, and only 7 Emperors from the World Devastator Cult remained here!

Strike the enemy when he is down. Jian Xu and the others understood that principle well, and they were about to attack. However, a figure suddenly crashed down from above.

Jian Xu and the others’ expressions changed drastically because it was Jian Ji’s figure!

Jian Xu shot over and caught Jian Ji.

Pu! Pu! Pu!

Mouthful after mouthful of blood sprayed from Jian Ji’s mouth. However, Jian Xu heaved a sigh of relief from the sight of this because Jian Ji was still alive! F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

The 7 Emperors from the World Devastator Cult heaved sighs of relief as well. Because the middle aged man with the folding fan, the leader of the World Devastator Cult, had appeared in front of them.

The middle aged man glanced at the scene here, and his face became extremely gloomy. He hadn’t expected that the absolute advantage they possessed had actually been transformed into a miserable defeat!

The middle aged man clenched his right fist slowly, but it didn’t take long for it to relax again. He gazed at Yang Ye who was enveloped by blood red light, “A sword of slaughter at the Void Rank, I severely underestimated you.”

He paused for a moment and continued, “Let’s drop this matter right here and now. My World Devastator Cult acknowledged your Sword Alliance’s standing in the continent, and we’ll stay out of each other’s business from now on. I....”

“Does my Sword Alliance need your acknowledgement? Who do you think you are?” Yang Ye’s voice resounded from within the blood red light, “Kill them! Leave no one alive!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye transformed into a blood red ray of light that shot at the middle aged man.
