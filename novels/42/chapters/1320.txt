Chapter 1321 – The Human Race Is Unnecessary!

Bang!

As soon as Yang Ye spoke, a terrifying aura surged out explosively from within him, and then Nie Tian and the others who were charging at him were instantly blasted around 300m back.

Nie Tian and the others were astounded!

At this moment, Yang Ye’s face had warped to the extreme. Obviously, he was enduring excruciating pain. His body was emanating faint flames, and his aura was rising explosively!

His aura was growing stronger and stronger!

“He’s using a secret technique to improve his cultivation! Stop him!” Nie Hun was shocked. Yang Ye was just a Quasi Emperor, yet Yang Ye’s strength was already so terrifying. If Yang Ye attained the Emperor Realm.... He didn’t dare imagine what would happen.

Nie Hun didn’t hesitate to stretch his right hand forward and claw at Yang Ye. In an instant, a huge palm instantly emerged from the space before Yang Ye and clawed forcefully at Yang Ye and Zi’er. It was about to tear them to bits.

Meanwhile, Nie Tian and the others didn’t just stand by idly, and they attacked in unison as well. Just thinking about Yang Ye attaining the Emperor Realm caused a chill to run down their spines!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly opened his eyes.

Bang!

A terrifying aura erupted from Yang Ye once more. This aura was countless times stronger than before, and it caused Nie Hun’s attack to be instantly obliterated.

The Emperor Realm!

Nie Hun’s pupils constricted at the sight of this, “Retreat! Retreat right now!” At this moment, he couldn’t be bothered about the Nie Clan’s honor. All he knew was that if they didn’t retreat right now, then they wouldn’t be able to do so forever.

As soon as he spoke, Nie Hun turned around and vanished into the horizon.

Nie Tian and the others reacted comparatively slowly, and they only reacted once they saw Nie Hun retreat. At this moment, they’d realized how serious the situation was.

The Emperor Realm!

Yang Ye had attained the Emperor Realm, and a chill ran down their spines when they thought up to this point. All of them fled in succession.

Suddenly, Yang Ye moved. He sheathed his sword into the ancient sheath before swiftly drawing it once more.

Om!

A sword howl resounded. This sword howl was unlike the previous sword howls. As soon as it resounded, the space in front of Yang Ye instantly cracked apart. At the same time, a beam of sword energy shot out from Yang Ye’s ancient sheath.

700 overlapped Heavenrends!

A Voider of the Nie Clan wasn’t even able to react before the sword energy pierced through him. His figure stiffened on the spot, and then his figure exploded in midair and was obliterated! As for the sword energy, it hadn’t vanished, and it continued forward. Space continued to collapse, inch by inch, as it shot forward.

Nie Tian and the others were horrified by the sight of this, and they hurriedly dodged to the side. In the end, they watched as it vanished into the sky. Behind the sword energy was an extremely long spatial rift that was around 300m wide, and it stretched all the way into the sky!

Nie Tian and the others turned pale when they noticed it.

Meanwhile, another sword howl resounded from afar.

Their figures instantly trembled upon hearing it. Because they knew that someone else was about to die. It wasn’t something they could dodge, let alone resist. Actually, if they hadn’t fled and joined forces, then it wouldn’t be too difficult for them to stop Yang Ye’s attacks.

However, their minds had fallen into chaos when they saw Yang Ye attain the Emperor Realm. At such a time, they had no intention to resist Yang Ye, and they only wanted to flee for their lives!

As the sword howl resounded, Nie Tian’s entire body shook, but he heaved a sigh of relief. Because he was still alive. He turned to look, and he saw the Senior Yuan’s figure had stiffened not too far away from him. Nie Tian paid no attention to Senior Yuan, and he immediately shouted at the last survivor, Nie Qing, “Let’s go!”

As soon as he finished speaking, both of them raised their speeds to its limits and instantly appeared 5,000km away. Even though they’d fled so swiftly, their hearts were still filled with terror. They were absolutely afraid that another sword howl would resound from behind them. It didn’t take long for them to heave sighs of relief because no sword howl had resounded.

There would be none, of course. Because Yang Ye was on the verge of collapse.

Yang Ye’s entire body was trembling as if he was freezing. The Sword God’s Seal on his forehead was shaking incessantly, and his sword intent was fluctuating between a strong and weak state. Moreover, it was very violent. It wasn’t just his sword intent, even his aura was very chaotic.

He’d been suffering backlash from improving his sword intent, and then he forcefully ignited his soul to attain the Emperor Realm. So, the backlash he suffered didn’t affect just his mind and soul, it affected his body as well.

Double backlash!

The reason he hadn’t lost consciousness was entirely because of his willpower. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Zi’er was right before him, so how could he lose consciousness?

It was exactly his willpower that had allowed him to kill 2 Voiders in succession while suffering the backlash from his sword intent and even prevent himself from losing consciousness until now.

As she gazed at Yang Ye, Zi’er’s heart felt like it was bleeding. She hugged him tightly and spoke with a trembling voice, “Let’s... let’s... let’s go.”

As soon as she finished speaking, she took Yang Ye along as she transformed into a ray of violet light that vanished on the spot.

...

The demon race.

In the Demon Empress’ palace, the Empress who sat cross-legged at its entrance suddenly opened her eyes, and then a smile curled up on the corners of her mouth, “11 out of 14 Voiders perished. Haha.... Looks like allowing Yang Ye to return was the right choice.”

As she spoke, she looked up at the sky and said, “Such forbearance. He didn’t act even after so many Voiders died. Interesting indeed!”

Mo Xiaoleng who was beside the Demon Empress spoke coldly, “That fellow, Yang Ye, is really a fool. He actually let 3 escape!”

The Empress chuckled softly and said, “He’s extremely formidable.” Her face gradually became solemn at this point, “He’s a true genius. If he’s given another 5 years, then there’ll probably be no one on this continent who’d be a match for him. Of course, my Xiaoleng is excluded from that.”

Mo Xiaoleng gently rubbed the multicolored snake on her arm and said, “While I don’t like him, his natural talent is extremely formidable. He can be considered a genius even in the large world. Of course, there’s quite a gap between us. Because his bloodline is of a low grade, so his accomplishments are limited. Unless he can overcome the shackles of his bloodline. Otherwise, he can only be considered a genius and not a monstrous genius. But the shackles of one’s bloodline.... It’s difficult, extremely difficult. Even that fellow from this world of yours who was once called the Sword God had been unable to accomplish that.”

The Demon Empress frowned slightly, “His bloodline?”

Mo Xiaoleng spoke indifferently, “Besides their own harm work and luck, the reason many geniuses are able to advance to the Emperor Realm or Voider Realm in a short time is their bloodline. Just like me. The reason I’m able to attain such accomplishments at my age is mainly my bloodline.”

The demon empress fell silent for a short while before she said, “Then since Yang Ye had been able to attain his current accomplishments in such a short time and possess such terrifying strength, is it because his bloodline is of a very high grade?”

Mo Xiaoleng frowned slightly, and she remained silent for a short while before she replied, “I didn’t sense anything special about his bloodline. There are 3 reasons for that. The first is that he hasn’t awakened it. The second is he doesn’t possess a formidable bloodline. The third is....”

The Demon Empress asked, “What is it?”

Mo Xiaoleng answered, “His bloodline is greater than mine, so I can’t sense it. But that’s utterly impossible. Because no person or demon’s bloodline is more noble than mine in this universe. Even the Heavenly Dragon Clan is only on par with my Divine... on par with the bloodline of my clan!” As she finished speaking, Mo Xiaoleng’s voice was filled with incomparable confidence and pride.

Mo Xiaoleng was very confident and proud, but she didn’t make others feel like she was acting, nor did it make others feel uncomfortable. It felt like she should be that confident and proud!

The Demon Empress glanced at Mo Xiaoleng. Obviously, Mo Xiaoleng refused to reveal her identity to the Demon Empress. However, the Demon Empress was a smart person, so she didn’t ask. There was always a limit to things, and if one went past those limits, then even friends were very likely to become enemies.

The Demon Empress stood up slowly and walked over to Mo Xiaoleng’s side. She took Mo Xiaoleng’s hand before starting to walk towards the distance. At the same time, the Demon Empress’ voice resounded through the sky, “Tell the leaders of the 12 clans to see me. I want to see them within 10 breaths of time. Besides that, order all the demon beasts at the Emperor Realm and above to prepare themselves and await my command.”

As soon as she finished, she looked down and glanced at Mo Xiaoleng before she said, “The human race is unnecessary in this world.”

...

Heaven Pillar Peak.

“Yang Ye has betrayed the human race!” These were the 1st words that Nie Hun spoke upon returning to Heaven Pillar Peak. It didn’t take long for Nie Clan’s forces to spread the news of Yang Ye’s betrayal throughout the continent.

As for whether Yang Ye had really betrayed the human race and sided with the demon race, no one thought about that. Because everyone said that he had.

At this moment, countless people throughout the Veiled Region were cursing Yang Ye, and there were even some profounders who’d formed groups to search for Yang Ye with the intention of eliminating him for the human race. However, once they heard that Yang Ye had killed over 10 Voiders at the Nie Clan, all of those people who wanted to eliminate him on behalf of the human race had instantly vanished.

Since they couldn’t act against him, they could only use their mouths.

So, everyone throughout the Veiled Region was cursing Yang Ye, and even the Sword Alliance and Slayer Pavilion weren’t able to avoid being implicated.

As for the main character of the incident, Yang Ye, life was worse than death for him right now.

Zi’er had brought Yang Ye to a dense forest. Yang Ye was lying on a huge rock while his body twitched incessantly. His face wasn’t just pale as a sheet, it was even severely warped. He looked rather fierce and terrifying!

It would be comparatively better if he’d fallen unconscious, but he just so happened to be awake. As far as Yang Ye was concerned, there was nothing more painful in the world than this.

Zi’er was at quite a loss for what to do. Because she didn’t know how to help Yang Ye at all. If it was possible, she was willing to help Yang Ye endure such pain, but it wasn’t!

She felt helpless!

She could only watch as Yang Ye suffered.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye opened his eyes and gazed at Zi’er. As he looked at her face that was covered in tears, a smile appeared on his ghastly pale face, “It’s just a while of pain. It’ll pass very quickly.”

Zi’er didn’t speak, and she just cried and cried.

A bitter smile curled up on the corners of Yang Ye’s mouth. He’d forcefully improved his sword intent, and then he’d ignited his soul to improve his cultivation. This time, it wasn’t just his sword intent that would drop, even his cultivation might drop as well!

I really did it this time!

What should I do?

I don’t want to lose my sword intent or cultivation!
