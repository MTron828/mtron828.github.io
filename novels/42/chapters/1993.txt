Chapter 1994 – Besieged!

Just like that, more and more shadows appeared.

Two hours later, Yang Ye was fighting 12 of them!

However, Yang Ye found it getting more and more difficult to persist in such battles.

Outside the Asura Grounds.

Zhi’er spoke softly, “What’s his limit?”

Uncle Guan pondered deeply for a moment and said, “20!”

Zhi’er had a trace of complicated emotions in her eyes, “If he really can fight 20, then his natural talent is sufficient to be entered amongst the famous geniuses of our race!”

Uncle Guan nodded, “He’s worthy of it!”

Zhi’er gazed at the Asura Grounds, “Unfortunately, he isn’t a part of our race.”

Uncle Guan fell silent.

…

In the Asura Grounds.

There were 20 shadows around Yang Ye, and all of them were images of himself.

Defend!

Yang Ye had adopted a defensive stance, and he only responded to their attacks. Because if he tried to attack, they would rain down a storm of attacks upon him. He wasn’t able to defend himself against something like that!

But he was in an absolutely passive position!

When facing the joint forces of 20 people, Yang Ye had no chance to counterattack at all. However, they weren’t able to get through his defenses as well.

So, they entered into a stalemate.

Suddenly, Uncle Guan appeared on the platform. He waved his right hand, and the shadows vanished.

Yang Ye sighed with relief and sat on the ground.

Exhaustion!

He was exhausted. It felt like he’d been bashed up for days, and his entire body was covered in injuries!

Uncle Guan walked over to Yang Ye, “What have you learned?”

Yang Ye gazed at Uncle Guan and was panting, “Let me rest for a while!”

Uncle Guan grinned, “Alright!”

Around an hour later, Yang Ye had finished recuperating.

Yang Ye gazed at Uncle Guan, “Can you fight 20 of your own shadows?”

Uncle Guan shook his head, “Those shadows are just copies in the end. So, how can they possess the true combat strength of the actual person? Of course, they aren’t much weaker either. They possess around 80% of your strength. In the beginning, the reason it suppressed you was because you underestimated yourself and didn’t use everything you had!”

Uncle Guan smiled and continued, “Actually, this test’s objective is to make you understand two things. Firstly, always use your full strength and never underestimate yourself. Secondly, it’s so you understand the importance of going on the defensive!”

Yang Ye frowned, “Defense?”

Uncle Guan nodded, “Your Sword Dao is too unyielding, and the way you fight is too aggressive. Of course, it makes your sword extremely sharp and fierce, but have you not noticed? When you’re unable to kill your opponent swiftly, or when your opponent is even more aggressive, what should you do then?”

Yang Ye fell silent. His sword always moved forward and never backwards!

Uncle Guan explained, “There are two sides to everything. Your sword is too aggressive, and while that isn’t wrong, why can’t you learn to take a step back or go on the defensive? You’ll only grow stronger if you can do both. What do you think?”

Yang Ye fell silent.

Meanwhile, Uncle Guan added, “Just like the fight from before. When you were attacked by 20 people, you couldn’t attack, so what else could you do but defend yourself? Regardless of whether it’s the Sword Dao or any other Dao, there’s both attack and defense. Just like all things in the world, there’s destruction, but there’s also new life. Understand?”

Yang Ye fell silent for a long time and nodded, “I understand.”

Uncle Guan grinned, waved his right hand, and they left the Asura Grounds. Meanwhile, Zhi’er walked over to Yang Ye and flicked a sword to Yang Ye. It was the Sword Supreme!

Zhi’er said, “Promise me something!”

Yang Ye gazed at her, and she said, “Don’t let it get the blood of my god race on it anymore.”

Yang Ye took the sword, “I won’t point it at the god race while it’s in my hands.”

Zhi’er smiled, “Then don’t let it fall into the hands of another.”

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings, and then he cupped his fist to them, “Thank you.”

Uncle Guan smiled and didn’t say anything.

Zhi’er said, “My god race will be leaving this place soon. Once we do, the seal here will vanish. At that time, you can leave this world, you must leave this world.”

“Why?” Yang Ye was quite curious because she said that he must leave.

Zhi’er explained, “Because this world will collapse. It’s not my god race’s doing, it’s because this world was already at the verge of collapse. One of the reasons my god race sealed this place was to delay the speed it collapsed at. If we didn’t seal this world, it wouldn’t even exist now!”

I see! Yang Ye nodded and asked, “Then where will you be going?”

Zhi’er smiled, “Back to our home.”

Yang Ye asked, “What about the other races?”

Zhi’er shook her head slightly, “They aren’t the same united races anymore, and we won’t go to war with them. Of course, chaos will descend very soon. This chaos won’t just extend to all the races, it’ll extend to the Weapon Path, Dao Path, Confucianist Path, Buddhist Path, and many other hidden powers…”

She chuckled, “The conflict between them has reached a breaking point. In short, good luck!”

Yang Ye nodded, “No matter what, thank you for today. Zhi’er, Senior, farewell!”

Yang Ye didn’t stay a moment longer and vanished on the spot.

“That kid isn’t bad!” Uncle Guan suddenly said, “I finally know why you didn’t kill him!”

Zhi’er closed her eyes slowly, “Unfortunately, he isn’t a member of our race. Otherwise, the speed our race rises up at would improve tremendously!”

Uncle Guan nodded slightly, “It’s quite a pity indeed! However, we’ll still rise up since we have you, and we’ll make the other races tremble before us!”

Zhi’er gaze gradually became icy cold, “The other races!”

…

Yang Ye met the Royal Crocodile again on his way out. This time, it merely glanced at him and displayed no hostility towards him.

Yang Ye nodded slightly, and then he vanished into the distance. Once Yang Ye vanished, a woman in a white dress suddenly appeared on the Royal Crocodile’s back.

She looked in the direction Yang Ye had vanished towards and seemed to be lost in thought.

…

In the clouds, Yang Ye shot forward swiftly on his sword. Suddenly, he stopped and looked down. There were many demon beasts dashing through the boundless mountain range, and they were heading in the direction of Southern Qilin Mountain!

Besides the demon beasts, Yang Ye saw many other human experts, and many had concealed yet powerful auras.

All of them were traveling towards Southern Qilin Mountain!

It was the hope of all the people in the Dead Dimension, their hope to escape.

Yang Ye moved his gaze away and spoke softly, “The world here is about to change!”

Yang Ye didn’t stay, and he sped up instead. It didn’t take long for him to return to the foot of Southern Qilin Mountain, and it was surrounded by a dense ocean of demon beasts.

The army of demon beasts had fully surrounded the mountain. Besides that, Yang Ye noticed the figures of humans amongst them. Obviously, the locals of the Dead Dimension had joined forces with the demon beasts!

Southern Qilin Mountain was in danger!

Yang Ye fell silent for a long time, and then he snuck up the mountain. At this moment, A’Man and the others were gathered together.

They nodded when they saw Yang Ye.

Yang Ye gazed at Qin Chuan, “Are you alright?”

Qin Chuan shrugged and smiled, “I’ve fully recovered!”

Yang Ye smiled, “Congratulations!”

Qin Chuan grinned. He glanced at Yang Ye, “You seem to have changed a little!”

Everyone gazed at Yang Ye, and Ling suddenly said, “You’ve grown stronger again!”

He has grown stronger again! All of them had quite strange expressions on their faces. Because the rate Yang Ye grew at was too terrifying.

Yang Ye smiled and said, “What were all of you discussing?”

A’Man pointed at a chair. Yang Ye went over and sat down. Meanwhile, A’Man said, “Southern Qilin Mountain probably won’t last!”

All of their faces fell when they heard this.

Southern Qilin Mountain could be considered the last sanctuary for outsiders like them. If they failed to defend it, the consequence would be being hunted endlessly. As for the worst outcome, it would naturally be being buried along with Southern Qilin Mountain!

A’Man gazed at Yang Ye, “What is your opinion?”

Yang Ye spoke solemnly, “We must leave the Dead Dimension!” He hadn’t forgotten what Zhi’er told him. The Dead Dimension was on the verge of collapse.

A’Man asked, “How?”

Yang Ye stood up, “According to my knowledge, the seal here will vanish in around a month from now. That’ll be the time we leave.”

A’Man asked, “Is your information reliable?”

Yang Ye nodded, “Yes!” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Meanwhile, Qin Chuan laughed bitterly, “Around a month? Even holding on for three days is an issue for us.”

Yang Ye fell silent. Based on the current situation, once the demon beasts attacked, then it would end exactly as Qin Chuan feared. Not to mention a month, even three days would be difficult!

All of them fell silent.

Suddenly, A’Man said, “If everyone here can work together, then we actually have a chance. Unfortunately, they refuse to unite, and many have started to plan their own escape.”

She glanced at the others, and then she gazed at Yang Ye, “Everyone here is someone I can trust, so tell me what all of you think. Shall we stay or flee together?”

Everyone gazed at Yang Ye.

Yang Ye fell silent for a long time. Right when he was about to speak, furious howls resounded from the demon beasts that surrounded the mountain.

A’Man spoke solemnly, “They’re attacking!”

Southern Qilin Mountain.

Countless demon beasts surged towards the mountain.

The entire mountain shook before them!
