Chapter 1397 – Slaughter!

Om!

A sharp and ear piercing sword howl suddenly resounded through Skyriver Continent, and then a snow white beam of sword energy shot out from Yang Ye’s ancient sheath. It shot forward like a bolt of lightning towards Skyriver City. Everywhere it passed, space was instantly sliced open. At the same time, the space in an area of around 1km in its vicinity collapsed inch by inch, creating a huge spatial rift that extended from Yang Ye towards Skyriver City.

At the moment the sword howl resounded, everyone within Skyriver City was horrified. As for the experts on the city walls, their souls almost left their bodies when they saw Yang Ye’s sword energy.

Yang Ye watched as the sword energy entered Skyriver City, and then it was instantly split into two.

Bang!

A loud explosion resounded from afar, and it was accompanied by countless shrill cries.

They didn’t have the chance to flee, and many hadn’t even been able to react.

It appeared too abruptly and too swiftly. Even the defensive formation around Skyriver City hadn’t been able to react in time before the sword energy sliced the city into two.

Yang Ye’s face was cold and indifferent as he gazed at the distant city which had been split into two. There was naturally a reason why he’d made such a flashy show of strength. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Lady was definitely under immense pressure. So, he wanted to use actions to tell the world and Lady that she wasn’t fighting alone!

So, he had to try his best to draw attention. The more attention he drew, the lesser the pressure Lady endured would be. Because both the experts of Skyriver Stellar Region and Celestial Demon Stellar Region would definitely send some of their forces to deal with him.

“Who did this?!” Suddenly, a furious howl resounded from Skyriver City, and then over a dozen formidable auras shot up into the air and charged in Yang Ye’s direction.

All of them were Semi-Deities!

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly, and then he sheathed his sword while his profound energy circulated madly.

It didn’t take long for 13 old men to appear in front of Yang Ye. The white haired old man who led the group was stunned when he saw Yang Ye’s appearance. He hadn’t expected that the person who launched this sudden attack on Skyriver City would be so young. But it didn’t take long for ferocity to cover his face, “Who are you?! Why have you attacked my Alliance of Guardians? I....”

Om!

A sword howl suddenly interrupted the old man, and then a strand of sword energy flashed out from the ancient sheath and carried an aura of absolute destruction as it shot towards the old man.

The old man’s pupils constricted at the sight of it. He wanted to fight back or flee, but it was too late. Because he was too close to Yang Ye, and Yang Ye had immediately drawn his sword without saying a word. So, the old man hadn’t put up his guard at all, and he could only watch as the sword energy struck his body.

Hiss!

The sword energy flashed by, and then the old man’s figure was instantly obliterated. At the same time, the powerful wave of force created by the sword energy blasted all the others around 3km away!

All of them were shocked!

However, Yang Ye didn’t waste his breath. He just drew his sword and swung it again.

A beam of sword energy flashed, and then another old man was instantly obliterated.

However, Yang Ye didn’t stop there. He sheathed his sword again and drew it swiftly, and then another old man vanished on the spot.

In an instant, 3 Semi-Deities had been killed, and the remaining 10 were stunned.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye sheathed his sword once more. All 10 old men were horrified by the sight of this. At this moment, they didn’t hesitate to turn around and vanish on the spot.

They didn’t fight!

Why?

Because they were completely horrified right now. Semi-Deities, those that had died were Semi-Deities! However, they hadn’t even been able to react before Yang Ye killed 3 of them.

At this moment, all of them felt that they couldn’t resist Yang Ye! Actually, they were utterly horrified. They couldn’t be blamed for that. As Semi-Deities, their mental strength and courage were definitely outstanding. But the problem was that Yang Ye was too terrifying. He hadn’t said a word before instantly killing 3 Semi-Deities!

He’d killed them in an instant! He hadn’t fought them, one by one, in battle! He’d just swung his sword 3 times and killed 2 Semi-Deities, and those Semi-Deities probably didn’t even know how they’d died!

Actually, they felt that Yang Ye was definitely a Deity!

Only a true Deity was capable of killing Semi-Deities like they were just helpless chicks.

A cold smile curled up on the corners of Yang Ye’s mouth when he saw them flee. He didn’t chase after them and just vanished on the spot.

4 attacks!

He’d drawn his sword 4 times just now, and the profound energy within his body and the Worldmend Stone had been completely exhausted. If the 10 remaining Semi-Deities had disregarded their safety and attacked him, then he would have no choice but to utilize the Stellar Ward technique. Moreover, even if he did that, he would be in a very bad situation. Because absorbing stellar energy would only allow him to draw his sword 3 more times. But they had 10 experts on their side!

Unfortunately, they hadn’t dared to stay and fight him!

Actually, this was the reason why Yang Ye hadn’t said anything and just killed 3 of them. He’d done so to give others the misconception that he was matchless and impossible to defeat. He’d succeeded. He’s actions of killing 3 Semi-Deities in succession had made their mental defenses collapse, and they didn’t even have the courage to fight him!

So, he had the opportunity to catch his breath.

Yang Ye didn’t flee after he left. He just used his Sword Domain to conceal himself and entered Skyriver City. Of course, he’d changed his clothes. His green clothes had been changed into a white robe, and his sword had been exchanged for a folding fan. He seemed like a rich young master.

At this moment, Skyriver City was filled with howls of sorrow. Countless people were crying with fear and fleeing madly.

Because everyone felt that a Deity had launched a surprise attack on Skyriver City!

Yang Ye paid no attention to them, and he just entered a wrecked pavilion.

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings before entering the Primordial Pagoda, and then he immediately went to the 3rd level. After that, he withdrew divine crystals and started absorbing them.

The effects of the 3rd level were truly heaven defying to the extreme. For example, if he were to repair his body and fill both his body and the Worldmend Stone’s reserves of profound energy, then it would take at least 2 or 3 days in the outside world. It took the same time in the 3rd level of the Primordial Pagoda, but 2 or 3 days here was only equivalent to around 2 to 4 hours in the outside world.

Regardless of whether it was used to cultivate or for other purposes, the 3rd level of the Primordial Pagoda was extremely terrifying.

Actually, Yang Ye really looked forward to the 4th level. Every single level of the Primordial Pagoda had given him a huge pleasant surprise. So, what surprise would the 4th level bring him? Moreover, he hadn’t forgotten what the Divine Yin Flame had said. He should go see it once he could access the 4th level. The Divine Yin Flame had definitely not told him that because it wanted to chat with him. Perhaps it would submit to him and protect him once he could access the 4th level!

If the Divine Yin Flame is willing to submit to me.... Just thinking about that made Yang Ye excited!

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts and started to absorb the energy within the divine crystals.

Time passed slowly. 2 days later, Yang Ye opened his eyes, and he’d recovered to his peak state.

Yang Ye glanced at Xiao Yuxi. At this moment, she was looking at him too. He grinned, walked over to her, wrapped his arms around her waist, and kissed her softly on the lips before he said, “Don’t worry. If I want to flee, then even Deities wouldn’t be able to catch me.”

Xiao Yuxi spoke softly, “Be careful!”

Yang Ye nodded, and then he vanished on the spot.

Once Yang Ye left, Xiao Yuxi remained silent for a long time before she spoke softly, “I’ll work hard on my cultivation....”

...

Skyriver City.

At this moment, the city was still in a mess. Actually, the chaos wasn’t entirely Yang Ye’s fault, and it was because many within the city had taken advantage of the situation to seek personal gain.

Once Yang Ye slashed the city into two, order had started to vanish within the city because everyone was busy taking care of themselves. So, at this moment, some had started to arouse malicious thoughts and took advantage of the situation. So, fighting and killing for treasures was going on throughout the city.

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings, and then suddenly stretched out his hand. A man instantly appeared within his grasp.

The man was horrified and was about to speak when Yang Ye spoke first, “Where are the experts of the alliance?” He couldn’t sweep the city with his divine sense. Because they would notice it. He wanted to take them by surprise.

The man was clearly terrified, and he even stuttered, “At... at the... City Governor’s Estate.”

Yang Ye asked, “Which way?”

The man raised his trembling hand and pointed to the side.

Yang Ye nodded, released the man, and then vanished on the spot.

Meanwhile, cold sweat was flowing from the man. Suddenly, he seemed to have thought of something, and then his pupils constricted, “Was... was he the one who slashed the city into two?”

...

Yang Ye didn’t waste any time and shot rapidly towards the City Governor’s Estate. Of course, he didn’t travel there openly. He made a show of strength when needed, but he knew when to keep a low profile. After all, keeping a low profile now made it easier for him to accomplish his goal.

Yang Ye stood before a wall as he looked up at a huge palace in the distance. It was extremely large and luxurious, and there were numerous obscure and powerful auras within it.

Yang Ye remained silent for an instant before the ancient sheath appeared in his grasp. There was a sword in it, the Sword Precursor.

A wisp of ferocity curled up on the corners of Yang Ye’s mouth as he gazed at the distant palace, and then he didn’t hesitate to grab the sword’s hilt with his right hand and draw it.

Om!

A sword howl suddenly resounded through Skyriver City, and the countenance of everyone within the city instantly turned ghastly pale.

It’s here again!

Bang!

The palace shattered before Yang Ye, and then countless shrill cries instantly resounded.

Yang Ye sheathed his sword, and then vanished on the spot.

Around 5 breaths of time later, another sword howl resounded through the city.

After that, a beam of sword energy descended from the sky, and it shot down like a bolt of lightning that was striking down upon Skyriver City.
