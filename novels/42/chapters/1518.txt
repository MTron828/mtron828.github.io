Chapter 1519 - That’s It For Today!

Translator: InVader

He intended to risk his life!

Yang Ye knew that it was time to fight with his life on the line!

When facing such forces, he had no choice but to put his life on the line. So, as soon as he attacked, he’d increased his sword intent to the Returnal Rank!

“How laughable!” Meanwhile, the old man in a luxurious robe laughed coldly, “Yang Ye, do you think that you can fight me just because you used a secret technique to improve your sword intent to the Rebirth Realm? How laughable!”

Yang Ye stopped moving and said, “I think that I can!”

“You can?” A wisp of ridicule curled up on the corners of the old man’s mouth, “Then why don’t you…”

The old man’s expression changed abruptly, “Watch out!” As he spoke, he slapped his palm at Yang Ye.

Because Yang Ye’s sword had vanished!

Hiss!

Bang!

As soon as the old man finished speaking, a strand of blood sprayed from the forehead of one of the Dualism Realm experts by his side. That Dualism Realm expert’s eyes were opened wide and filled with bewilderment. Even until the moment of his death, he didn’t know how he’d died!

At the moment that Dualism Realm expert perished, Yang Ye was blasted far away by the old man in a luxurious robe. But he didn’t suffer much harm because he’d used the casket lid to block off most of the force from the old man’s attack!

At this moment, the old man and all the others had extremely unsightly expressions on their faces.

Yang Ye had actually killed one of their companions right before their eyes! Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

It was especially so for the old man. His face was extremely gloomy right now. After all, it was a terrible humiliation to allow Yang Ye to kill one of the experts on his side while in his presence!

Suddenly, the old man’s expression changed drastically, “Watch out!” As he spoke, a terrifying aura surged out from his body, and then it descended like a landslide!

The old man’s aura of a Rebirth Realm expert was extremely swift, and it instantly slammed against Yang Ye. Or to be more precise, it slammed against Yang Ye’s casket lid. As expected, Yang Ye was blasted away.

However, the body of a Dualism Realm expert standing not too far away from the old man gradually vanished on the spot.

The reason the old man had attacked again was because Yang Ye had attacked!

However, he was still too late!

When they saw another Dualism Realm expert killed in an instant, the remaining Dualism Realm experts had extremely solemn expressions on their faces. At the same time, they immediately converged together and released their auras around themselves.

They’d been careless, and they’d underestimated their opponent!

They’d tried their best to think highly of Yang Ye when they came here, and it even made them send a Rebirth Realm expert and ten Dualism Realm experts! They’d dispatched such a force to annihilate Yang Ye without giving him a chance.

However, they hadn’t expected that they’d still underestimated him, and they’d underestimated him tremendously!

Yang Ye wiped off the blood on the corner of his mouth, and then he looked up at the old man and the others while a fierce smile curled up on the corners of his mouth. The reason he hadn’t attacked the old man right away was that he couldn’t kill the old man. Rebirth Realm experts were too strong, so the Rebirth Sword couldn’t kill the old man. It was impossible even if his sword intent was at the Returnal Rank!

However, it wasn’t a problem for him to kill Dualism Realm experts!

Quasi Returnal Rank sword intent and the Rebirth Sword were a huge threat to Dualism Realm experts. Now that his sword intent had improved to the Returnal Rank, the Rebirth Sword’s might had risen countless times!

Returnal Rank sword intent and the Rebirth Sword were sufficient to instantly kill Dualism Realm experts!

The old man didn’t waste his breath this time.

Earlier, Yang Ye had been able to kill two Dualism Realm experts because he spoke too much nonsense. Now, the old man had realized that Yang Ye liked to take his opponents by surprise. So, the old man waved his hand, “Don’t give him any chances! Attack together!”

As soon as he gave the order, he clawed at Yang Ye with his right hand, and a huge claw flashed forward and slammed down at Yang Ye.

As for the other Dualism Realm experts, they attacked simultaneously as well. This time, they refused to give Yang Ye another chance!

Not only did Yang Ye show no signs of retreating before the joint attack of nine supreme experts, he even charged at his enemies.

The distance between them had never been huge, so it didn’t take long for Yang Ye to get close to them. Similarly, the old man and the others’ attacks had arrived in front of Yang Ye.

Suddenly, Yang Ye’s sword vanished once more!

Hiss!

Bang!

At the same moment his sword vanished, one of the Dualism Realm experts’ head flew up into the air. Meanwhile, Yang Ye was blasted away while holding onto his casket lid. Yang Ye spat out around five mouthfuls of blood as he flew. Besides that, his entire body had started to crack open, and strands of blood seeped out incessantly from him. However, it only took an instant for his Heart of Slaughter to absorb all the blood!

Yang Ye’s figure stopped after flying more than 10km away. Once he stopped himself, Yang Ye flipped his palm, and an Energy Pearl flew into his mouth without making a sound.

Meanwhile, the old man and the others had arrived not too far away from him. Unexpectedly, they didn’t attack.

“Don’t have any profound energy left?” The old man laughed coldly, “A Semi-Deity will always be a Semi-Deity. Even if you possess the strength to kill Dualism Realm experts, you’re still a Semi-Deity. Regardless of how extraordinary your combat strength is, it’ll only last for a moment if you don’t have sufficient profound energy! But don’t worry, we won’t kill you. We’ll hang you on the Heavenpath so everyone from the lower dimensions can witness the consequence of challenging our large world!”

Suddenly, Yang Ye looked up at the old man, and then his sword vanished once more!

Hiss!

At the moment the sword vanished, the head of a Dualism Realm near the old man had instantly shot up into the air.

The old man and the others were stunned. He still has profound energy?

Suddenly, Yang Ye’s sword vanished again.

Hiss!

The head of another Dualism Realm expert flew up into the air!

In an instant, two Dualism Realm experts had been killed. At this moment, everyone here was astounded, and the old man was shocked as well. However, his reaction was extremely swift. He immediately shot towards Yang Ye. As for the other Dualism Realm experts, they’d recovered from their shock when the old man attacked, and they charged at Yang Ye as well!

At this moment, they weren’t thinking about taking Yang Ye alive. Now, they just wanted to kill him! Even though they were very puzzled by the fact that Yang Ye still had profound energy, they didn’t have the time to think about all of that. Because they were afraid that Yang Ye would draw his sword again!

Yang Ye naturally had profound energy!

After he consumed an Energy Pearl, his profound energy had been completely replenished. Once that happened, his injuries were almost completely healed by the Primordial Violet Energy within him.

He was a Semi-Deity now, so his profound energy was much larger in volume than before. Coupled with the Worldmend Stone, he could execute the Rebirth Sword around three times. Under normal circumstances, that still wouldn’t be enough for him to fight the old man and the other Dualism Realm experts. However, he had Energy Pearls!

Energy Pearls could make up for the insufficient profound energy he had!

It didn’t take long for Yang Ye to be locked in battle with the old man’s group. Actually, Yang Ye was completely suppressed. He could only defend himself against their frenzied attacks. Fortunately, he had the casket lid. Coupled with his own physical defenses and the swift recovery he gained from the Primordial Violet Energy, he was able to avoid being killed in an instant!

However, even then, Yang Ye had still killed another Dualism Realm expert!

Yang Ye seemed to have no strength to fight back, but as soon as he did retaliate, he instantly took a life! Yang Ye was very smart, so he didn’t fight the old man head-on. Whenever the old man attacked, he would either dodge or use the casket lid. In any case, he refused to fight the old man. So long as he had the chance, he would attack the other Dualism Realm experts instead!

This made the old man feel extremely aggrieved. His strength was able to firmly suppress Yang Ye, and Yang Ye would definitely lose if Yang Ye fought him directly. However, Yang Ye refused to fight him. Besides that, even though his strength far surpassed Yang Ye, Yang Ye’s physical defenses and the presence of the casket lid caused him to be unable to kill Yang Ye in an instant!

The most terrifying thing was Yang Ye’s recovery speed. Logically speaking, the joint forces of himself and so many Dualism Realm experts would have injured Yang Ye even from just the aftershock. However, Yang Ye refused to die. His recovery was simply impossible to describe with words.

They were still fighting intensely!

From the beginning of the battle until now, the old man in a luxurious robe had lost five Dualism Realm experts from his side!

Now, it was six against one!

Even though the old man’s forces had grown smaller, Yang Ye was suffering more and more injuries. In the beginning, he’d been able to barely resist them. But as the battle carried on and coupled with the fact that the old man and the others were attacking him even more violently, his recovery couldn’t keep up with his injuries.

At this moment, Yang Ye’s appearance was quite shocking. Because his body seemed like a glass bottle that had been struck, and he was covered in cracks, even on his face. Blood was oozing out incessantly from them, but it didn’t take long for the blood to be absorbed. Even though the Primordial Violet Energy within him was repairing his injuries, a new crack would appear before one could even be fully healed. Or perhaps one had just been repaired when it would be cracked open again, and it may even be more severe than how it was when it cracked open the first time!

At this moment, the Primordial Violet Energy within him couldn’t keep up with the rate he was suffering injuries at.

However, if it wasn’t for the Primordial Violet Energy, he would have been blasted into pieces by now.

Right when Yang Ye was about to shatter into pieces, he suddenly flashed over to Heaven’s Door, and he said, “That’s it for today! I’ll be back tomorrow!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he turned around and entered the door.

The old man and the others were stunned on the spot.
