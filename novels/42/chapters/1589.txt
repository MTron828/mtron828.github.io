Little Sky went over to Yang Ye and asked softly, “Are you alright?”

Yang Ye wiped off the blood on the corner of his mouth, and a solemn expression filled his eyes as he looked up at the little girl who seemed to be at a loss for what to do!

He hadn’t been blasted back by a glance from her, and it was because an extremely terrifying wave of energy had slammed against him when she looked at him.

Yang Ye hadn’t even been able to react when it slammed against it!

She was absolutely strong!

The little girl gazed at Yang Ye and spoke softly, “I... I didn’t mean to do that.”

Little Sky hurriedly said, “She really didn’t do it on purpose.”

Yang Ye smiled and replied, “Don’t worry, I naturally know she didn’t do it on purpose, so I’m not angry.” Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

The little girl’s expression instantly eased up.

Little Sky chuckled, and then she gazed at the little girl, “Qin, you’ve grown stronger.”

“Really?” The little girl spoke softly, “I don’t really know.”

Yang Ye suddenly asked, “What sort of energy was that?”

Little Sky hesitated for a moment and replied, “Yin Energy.”

“Yin Energy?” Yang Ye was puzzled.

Little Sky explained, “Once a person dies, Death Energy will be formed. However, do you know what Death Energy transforms into after existing for a long time?”

Yang Ye asked, “Yin Energy?”

Little Sky nodded, “When Death Energy exists in the world for too long, it’ll slowly undergo a qualitative change. Once the change is complete, it transforms into Yin Energy. Qin’s physique is unique, so she must absorb Death Energy and Yin Energy to survive. Thus, she chose such a place to live in. Moreover, she has to get a huge number of corpses and bring them here every year. She can only continue living while she has an endless supply of Yin Energy and Death Energy.”

Yang Ye gazed at the little girl called Qin and said, “What physique is that?”

“The Yin Soul Body!” Little Sky spoke softly, “It’s a very strange physique, and it has never appeared throughout the history of Sky Sky Continent.”

Little Sky walked over to Qin and spoke softly, “Because of this physique, she is unable to live in peace. Because if she stays at a place for long, that place will start becoming filled with Death Energy and Yin Energy.”

Yang Ye asked, “So, she can only stay here?”

Little Sky nodded.

Meanwhile, Qin suddenly took Little Sky’s hand and smiled, “Little Sky, it has been so long since you’ve come here. You have to play with me for a long time.”

Little Sky shook her head slightly, “I can’t play with you for now.”

Qin was puzzled, “Why?”

Little Sky replied, “Because many people are coming to bully us.”

Qin frowned, “Who?”

Little Sky answered, “They aren’t from our world. In any case... in any case, I’m here to get help from you. Prepare yourself, I’ll tell you when the fight happens.”

“No problem!” Qin spoke seriously, “Your business is my business. I’ll hit anyone who dares to bully you!”

Little Sky chuckled, “Alright, then get prepared. I have to go see one last fellow. This time, we’re going to have a good fight. We’ll allow those fellows to realize that our Merak System isn’t that easy to bully!”

Qin clenched her fists and nodded seriously, “Alright. We’ll have a good fight. I haven’t fought for so long. I’m quite excited.”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

Little Sky clenched her fists, “We’ll fight to our heart’s content!”

This time, Little Sky didn’t just leave, and she played with Qin for some time. Their game was very simple, and it was jumping in those squares. Moreover, they were playing at night. Needless to say, it was quite a strange scene.

Around six hours later, Little Sky and Yang Ye left the cemetery. As for Qin, she just stood there and watched them until they vanished.

Little Sky suddenly spoke while they traveled, “She’s very pitiable!”

Yang Ye asked, “Why?”

Little Sky spoke softly, “Lonely. She’s very lonely. Moreover, she may be lonely forever.”

Yang Ye frowned, “She can find friends. Look, aren’t you very good friends with her?”

“I’m her only friend!” Little Sky continued, “And she’ll only have me as her friend.”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Why?”

Little Sky said, “Anyone, even Sprite Kings or the Sprite Lord can’t stay with her for long. They’ll die if they do.”

Yang Ye frowned, “I was with her for some time just now, but nothing happened to me!”

Little Sky shook her head, “You’re special. Because your profound energy can resist the Death Energy and Yin Energy within her. Your profound energy is the only profound energy I’ve come across that can resist Death Energy and Yin Energy.”

Yang Ye spoke solemnly, “I may be able to eliminate the Death Energy and Yin Energy within her!”

Little Sky shook her head, “That won’t work.”

Yang Ye asked, “Why?”

She turned to look at him, “Because she’s not a living person.”

Yang Ye was stunned speechless.

Meanwhile, Little Sky continued, “However, she can’t be considered to be completely dead as well. She’s in between the living and the dead. Simply speaking, she’s half alive and half dead. Sigh. In any case, I don’t really know much about her physique. I didn’t expect this to happen when I saved her all those years ago.”

Yang Ye asked, “Saved her? You saved her?”

Little Sky nodded, “She almost died all those years ago. I forgot how I saved her. Anyway, while I kept her alive, she became like that. In the past, I would spend time with her when I was free. However, I fell asleep for some reason. She has definitely been really lonely during this time.”

Yang Ye asked, “Aren’t you afraid of the Death Energy and Yin Energy she possesses?”

Little Sky shook her head, “No!”

Yang Ye asked, “Why?”

She shrugged, “I don’t know. I just know I don’t fear it.”

Yang Ye gazed at her for a long time and said, “Little Sky, tell me the truth. Have you recovered your memories?”

Little Sky fell silent for a while, and then she replied, “I’ve recovered some of them. But not all of them. However, based on the speed I’m recovering them at, it probably won’t take long.”

Yang Ye asked, “Then do you know who you are?” He was very curious about Little Sky’s identity.

Little Sky shrugged, “I seem to know a little, but I’m not too sure.”

Yang Ye felt speechless.

Meanwhile, Little Sky suddenly chuckled, “No matter who I am, we’re still friends, right?”

Yang Ye smiled when he heard this, “Indeed. No matter who you are, you’re still my friend.” Even though Little Sky had never helped him in battle, she’d really helped him on so many occasions. However, he’d never really helped her. Of course, if friends made a fuss about such things between them, then their friendship would be meaningless.

Little Sky spoke softly, “Actually, you’re quite a good person. However, you’re only nice to your loved ones and friends. As for everyone else, you like to take an eye for an eye, and not repay enmity with kindness.”

Yang Ye smiled, “Are you trying to teach me to be a good person again?”

Little Sky shook her head, “Actually, I’ve figured it out. At most times, we can’t exercise forbearance. If we take a step back, it may not result in freedom from troubles, and it may cause the other party to try and take a yard instead. Just look at the Nether Pavilion. I told them not to come and bully us, but they refuse to listen.”

The Nether Pavilion! Yang Ye fell silent. Before this, he felt that Merak System may really be finished. After all, not to mention the Nether Judge, their new Pavilion Master, and their other members, just that Nether Envoy and the ten Nether Halls were extremely terrifying. If the ten Nether Halls worked together with that Nether Envoy, they would be able to sweep through the continent without being hindered at all!

Before this, he really wasn’t able to see any hope for the continent.

Yet now, he felt that it wouldn’t be easy for the Nether Pavilion to conquer this universe.

Meanwhile, Little Sky placed her hands behind her back and started hoping off into the distance, “Greed is a form of original sin. Anyone, regardless of whether they are human, demon, or from another race, they have to pay for their greed.”

She suddenly stopped when she spoke up to this point, and then she turned to look at Yang Ye, “Do you know what I like about you the most?”

Yang Ye felt quite embarrassed, “Little Sky, are you confessing to me? Isn’t it a little too sudden?”

“Such thick skin!” Little Sky patted her face and said, “There are Sprite Kings and a Sprite Lord by your side, yet you have no intention to use them at all. Conversely, you’re very good to them, and you’re willing to give extremely precious things to them. For example, that Spirit Pearl, or how you were willing to risk your life against the Divine Phoenix Clan for Snowy. I firmly believe that even if they weren’t Sprite Kings or the Sprite Lord, you would definitely treat them the same way.”

Yang Ye remained silent.

Meanwhile, Little Sky continued, “Everyone is selfish, and so are you. Moreover, you’re extremely selfish. However, you’re very selfless when it comes to your loved ones and those you care about. It’s a blessing to be your friend, and being your enemy is misfortunate. Because you disregard everything, and you’re quite insane.”

Yang Ye remained silent for a few breaths of time, and then he smiled, “Are you praising me?”

Little Sky chuckled, “Sort of!”

Yang Ye glanced at her and asked, “Who are we going to see now?”

The people Little Sky was going to see were definitely not ordinary, so he was extremely curious about who she was going to now, or perhaps it was a demon or a Sprite King.

Little Sky turned to look towards the distance and answered, “Someone who reincarnates frequently.”
