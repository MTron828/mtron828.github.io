Chapter 1947 – Farewells! Dead Dimension!

Leave the Shaman Dimension!

Yang Ye frowned, “Why?”

Yin Hou shook her head slightly, “You know why!”

Yang Ye spoke in a low voice, “The shaman race wants the sword too?”

She nodded, “The shaman race has 12 Shaman Kings. Besides that, there are the various elders, commanders, and so on and so forth. They’ve unanimously agreed that your sword can’t fall into the hands of the human race! In short, they want to take it from you!”

Take it!

Even the shaman race wanted to take it!

Yang Ye fell silent.

Meanwhile, Yin Hou said, “Actually, I understand why they are thinking and acting in that way.”

Yang Ye gazed at her, and she said, “If you’re a member of the shaman race, then perhaps they wouldn’t act like this. But you’re human. In the past, that sword was in the Sovereign of Sky’s possession, and the Sovereign of Sky guarded the Central Plains. Coupled with his extraordinary strength, no one dared to target that sword. But you’re different. You’re very weak, and it’s a huge opportunity for my shaman race. However…”

She shook her head slightly, “Hurry up and leave! Get as far away as you can!”

Yang Ye smiled, “I didn’t expect so many to desire this sword!”

“It isn’t just many, it’s a tremendous amount!” Yin Hou spoke solemnly, “It possesses the ability to break through barriers, so it’s a potential threat to all the races. Moreover, possessing it is like possessing the initiative. Yet now, it’s in your hands, and you don’t have strength that can instill fear in the various races. You possess something that doesn’t conform to your current strength, and that’s a good thing but also a bad thing!”

She glanced at Yang Ye and spoke softly, “While your current situation is terrible, it’s a form of tempering as well. Come! I’ll send you off!”

Yin Hou seemed to have thought of something at this point, and she was stunned on the spot.

Send Yang Ye off!

But send him where?

The shaman race wasn’t the only race that wanted the sword, the other races wanted to take it from Yang Ye too. So, where could she send him?

Yang Ye shrugged, “Why do I feel like there’s no place for me in the large universe?”

A long time passed before Yin Hou spoke in a low voice, “Do you dare to go to the Dead Dimension?”

“The Dead Dimension?” Yang Ye was puzzled, “What kind of place is that?”

Yin Hou spoke solemnly, “An absolutely dangerous place!”

“Absolutely dangerous?” Yang Ye frowned slightly, “What kind of danger?”

Yin Hou spoke solemnly, “The Dead Dimension is on a dead planet, and it has no spirit energy. Not only is that planet devoid of spirit energy, it’s filled with poison mist and all sorts of other natural threats. As for the people who live there, they aren’t ordinary at all!”

Yang Ye asked, “Why?”

Yin Hou asked, “Would ordinary people go to such a place?”

Yang Ye shook his head. There was no spirit energy there. As far as cultivators were concerned, a place without spirit energy was like a place without air to commoners, it was very difficult to survive in a place like that.

Yin Hou said, “The people there are mostly those who aren’t able to survive in the normal world. You may look down on them at this point, but you absolutely shouldn’t. For example, if you go to the Dead Dimension and someone underestimates you, that person will have to pay a terrible price!”

Yang Ye said, “Senior, what did you mean when you said they weren’t able to live in the normal world?”

Yin Hou explained, “They offended a powerful organization. Just like you, you’ve offended the various races. So, you’re unable to live in the normal world and are forced to go to the Dead Dimension.”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

Yang Ye continued, “Being forced to the Dead Dimension proves that they weren’t existences that were easy to deal with in the normal world. There aren’t just humans there, the members of the shaman race, sky race… In short, all the races live there!”

Yang Ye spoke solemnly, “How do they live without spirit energy?”

Yin Hou replied, “That’s the most terrifying part about that place!”

Yang Ye asked, “What do you mean?”

Yin Hou explained, “The laws of survival are more than 10 times more brutal there. There’s no spirit energy there, but that doesn’t represent that it’s impossible to grow stronger. Some temper their bodies through various methods, allowing their bodies to arrive at inconceivable levels; some cultivate with all sorts of different stones with energy… The cultivation environment there is extremely adverse, but those who are able to overcome it possess absolutely terrifying strength!”

She shook her head slightly and continued, “The quality of the experts there is much, much higher than the outside world. Your current strength is sufficient to surmount your realm of cultivation and challenge 4th stage Enlightened Realm experts in the outside world, but I’m afraid that won’t be possible in the Dead Dimension. Experts are hidden throughout that place!”

Yang Ye asked, “Do the people from the outside world dare not go in there?”

Yin Hou nodded, “Unless they have no other choice, no one is willing to go to that place. Because the living environment there is truly too adverse. Coupled with the fact that only vicious people reside there, even experts at my level may not be able to survive there!”

She gazed at Yang Ye and continued, “Kid, the reason I’m suggesting that you go there isn’t merely because you can temporarily hide from the various races, there’s one other reason, and it’s that I hope you’ll temper yourself there. Trust me, if you’re able to stay there for a few years, your strength will definitely undergo a transformation!”

Yang Ye laughed bitterly, “Aren’t you worried that I would be killed?”

Yin Hou patted Yang Ye lightly on the shoulder, “You must lay low for some time. Otherwise, even if you don’t get chased down and killed, you’ll die of exhaustion. You need time to grow, and the Dead Dimension is an opportunity for you!”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and replied, “Alright, I’ll go!”

She nodded slightly, “I’ll wait for your return!”

Yang Ye smiled and didn’t say anything.

Meanwhile, Yin Hou said, “Come, I’ll send you there!”

Yang Ye was about to nod when he suddenly frowned. A short while passed before he gazed at Yin Hou, “Can you give me a little time?” Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Yin Hou nodded slightly, “Don’t take too long. It won’t take long for those old fellows to find out that you’re here!”

Her figure trembled and vanished from the room.

Once she left, Yang Ye went into the Primordial Pagoda.

Yang Lianshuang and the others had completed their closed door cultivation!

Yang Lianshuang said, “We’re leaving!”

“Leaving?” Yang Ye was puzzled, “Why?”

She grinned, “While this cultivation room of yours is great, we can’t just keep cultivating in here, right? All of us plan to travel the large universe.”

Travel the large universe!

Yang Ye thought for a moment and nodded slightly, “True. You’ll go crazy if you stay here forever!”

He gazed at Nether Maiden, “Have all of you thought about where you’ll go?”

Nether Maiden spoke solemnly, “We plan to look for Hall Master Shao Siyou!”

Yang Ye was astounded, “You’re still going to look for her?”

Nether Maiden smiled, “She asked us to go to her after we get to the large universe!”

Yang Ye asked, “Where is she?”

Nether Maiden replied, “The Human Dimension!”

Yang Ye spoke in a low voice, “Be careful.”

Nether Maiden nodded slightly, “We plan to bring our eldest sister with us.”

Sky Maiden!

Yang Ye asked, “What’s going on with her?”

Nether Maiden shook her head, “We’re not very sure either. So, we plan to bring her the Hall Master. She’ll definitely know what’s wrong.”

Yang Ye said, “Just be careful.”

“You should be more worried about yourself!” Nether Maiden continued, “You’re in a much worse situation than we are.”

Yang Ye smiled, “It’s fine. You know how tenacious I am!”

Nether Maiden nodded slightly, “Take care!”

She and the others left once she finished speaking.

“Take care!” Yang Lianshuang left once she finished speaking.

Only Su Qingshi and the others remained.

Suddenly, An Nanjing, who’d been silent until now, said, “I plan to head to the Immortal Martial Sect!”

Yang Ye gazed at her, “The Immortal Martial Sect?”

An Nanjing nodded slightly, “It’s one of the ten paradises in the Human Dimension, and it’s where the Wu Clan’s ancestor is.”

Yang Ye thought for a long time. While he didn’t want her to leave, he still nodded in the end. An Nanjing possessed extraordinary natural talent, so staying with him would be a waste of her talent. She should pursue her own cultivation and not stay by his side.

An Nanjing spoke softly, “Be careful in the Dead Dimension!”

Yang Ye smiled, “Don’t worry, I rarely allow myself to suffer.”

An Nanjing nodded slightly, and then she vanished from the room.

Yang Ye took a deep breath, “All good things must come to an end!”

Su Qingshi walked over to him and spoke softly, “You’ll meet again!”

Yang Ye smiled, “What about all of you? All of you aren’t going anywhere, right?”

Su Qingshi didn’t say anything. She just held his hand gently, and there was no need to say anything.

After accompanying them for a while, Yang Ye left his room. Yin Hou was waiting outside.

Yin Hou asked, “Who were those people?”

“My friends!” Yang Ye continued, “They should be able to leave the Shaman Dimension safely, right?”

Yin Hou nodded slightly, “I’ve made the necessary arrangements. They’ll be able to leave safely if they don’t cause any trouble!”

Yang Ye nodded, “Let’s go!”

Yin Hao didn’t say anything, and she just waved her right hand and vanished on the spot with Yang Ye.

Around 15 minutes later, Yin Hou suddenly stopped high above in the clouds.

Yang Ye gazed at her, “What is it?”

Her face was gloomy, “They’re here!”
