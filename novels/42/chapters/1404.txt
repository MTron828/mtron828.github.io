Chapter 1405 – Fight To The Death!

Clouds of Heaven Stellar Region.

It had once been a three star stellar region. It didn’t just have a medium world, it had over 100 small worlds. Yet now, it only had a medium world and 2 small worlds in its vicinity.

Clouds of Heaven Continent, Clouds of Heaven City.

Clouds of Heaven City was the main city on the continent, and it was the stellar region’s last line of defense. If they lost the city, it meant that Clouds of Heaven Stellar Region would vanish from this universe.

A woman stood on the city walls with her hands behind her back. She was looking up at the sky with a calm and indifferent gaze. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

She wore pure white leather armor that wrapped tightly around her delicate figure, causing her figure to seem even more attractive. Her ink black hair was tied behind her back with a white ribbon. Her hair wasn’t very long, and it stopped just at her waist. There was a pure white halberd floating to her right!

She was Zhuang Weiran!

The sky was densely covered in black clouds, and it was clear that a storm was approaching.

Suddenly, a middle aged man and a beautiful woman appeared on the city wall.

The middle aged man wore golden armor, and his entire body emanated a strand of powerful battle intent. However, his countenance seemed quite pale, and there was a trace of exhaustion in his eyes. The beautiful woman by his side seemed to be only a little over 30, and her countenance was quite pale just like the middle aged man.

They were Lady’s parents, Zhuang Weitian and Qian Yaochan.

Lady suddenly spoke, “The other two worlds are gone?”

Zhuang Weitian nodded, “We only have Clouds of Heaven Continent now.”

Lady closed her eyes slowly when she heard this.

“Weiran, what exactly do you intend to do?” Zhuang Weitian spoke in a low voice, “Celestial Demon Stellar Region has 6 Deities, yet we only have three left. As for Semi-Deities, they have numerous times more than we have. Moreover, not all the experts they’ve been hiding have joined the battle. If we didn’t have the Wargod Formation on Clouds of Heaven Continent, we would have been conquered a long time ago. Yet now, even the Wargod Formation can’t stop them.”

Lady opened her eyes and gazed at Zhuang Weitian, “Then if it’s up to you, what should we do in this situation?”

“Marry Man Tian from Wildlands Stellar Region.” Meanwhile, Qian Yaochan spoke abruptly, “Weiran, I wouldn’t force you to marry Man Tian if he was a useless fellow. However, he’s a peerless genius whose natural talent is merely slightly inferior to yours. Marrying him isn’t a disgrace for you.”

Qian Yaochan took a deep breath, shook her head, and continued, “Weiran, countless people from our stellar region have perished because you insisted on refusing. Now, if you continue, then our stellar region will be eliminated from this world. Even if you refuse to think for your own future, you should think for us, your younger brother, and all the other living beings throughout the continent. Don’t tell me that you really want all of us to die in battle with you?”

Lady didn’t speak, but her hands behind her back were slowly being clenched tightly.

Qian Yaochan said, “Weiran, Wildlands Stellar Region has agreed to step forward and mediate between us and Celestial Demon Stellar Region once you agree. They’ve guaranteed that if Celestial Demon Stellar Region refuses to spare us, then they’ll send experts to help us!”

Lady said, “In other words, everyone’s lives are in my hands, right?”

Zhuang Weitian sighed, “Weiran, I know that you strive to excel, and you’re definitely unable to accept something like marrying someone in order to gain peace. However, we have no other choice. The Celestial Demon Lord’s strength is at the peak of the Deity Realm, and he has obtained the help of two ferocious Celestial Demon Wolves that are comparable to peak Deities as well. If we don’t have the Wargod Formation to keep them busy, then we aren’t a match for them. Yet now, even the Wargod Formation won’t be able to stop them if they attack at full force.”

“Big Sister, Can you really bear to watch as all of us die?” Meanwhile, a voice came from the side, and then a man who looked slightly similar to Zhuang Weiran walked over here. The man pointed at the guards on the city walls and said, “Father, Mother, me, them, and all the other billions of living beings throughout our continent might die in the battle that’s about to occur. Can you really bear to watch all of us die?”

Lady didn’t speak, but the hands behind her back were clenched tightly. It was so tight that her nails had pierced her palm and threads of blood were seeping out from the cracks between her fingers.

Lady remained silent for a long time before she said, “The forces of Skyriver Stellar Region have retreated. Do all of you know why?”

She didn’t wait for them to speak and continued, “Because he’s helping us. Our stellar region isn’t fighting alone. We have reinforcements as well. We....”

“You’re speaking about that fellow, Yang Ye, right?” Qian Yaochan interrupted her and said, “Weiran, I’ve heard of him from Fen Cangyan. You didn’t just give our family heirloom, the Wargod Ring, to him, you even have an agreement with him. Weiran, you’re truly foolish! I’ve investigated him. He really is a genius, but so what? Can he stop Celestial Demon Stellar Region? He can’t!”

She laughed coldly at this point and continued, “Besides that, he hasn’t dared to come here until now. I think he doesn’t dare to come here at all. Weiran, entrusting your hopes to him will only bring calamity to everyone else!”

Lady shook her head and said, “Since he said that he would come, then he definitely will.”

Qian Yaochan replied, “Weiran, can’t you think about everyone else? And think about your own future too!”

Zhuang Weitian nodded, “Weiran, your natural talent is countless times better than mine, and you’ve even obtained the guidance of a mysterious expert. Your future is very bright. It wouldn’t be worth it to let yourself die here. Marrying into Wildlands Stellar Region is beneficial to us and you. So, why be so stubborn?”

Lady suddenly looked up at Zhuang Weitian and said, “Father, you obtained the Wargod’s inheritance before me. Tell me, what is a Wargod?”

“What are you trying to say?!” Zhuang Weitian gazed at her with bewilderment in his eyes.

Lady grabbed the halberd by her side and said, “I met an old man in Daoist robes by chance. That old man told me something. Do you know what he said? He said the Wargod never makes compromises or speaks about defeat. If a Wargod goes to battle, the Wargod fights to the death. That’s what a Wargod is!”

Zhuang Weitian fell silent.

Lady continued, “Father, from the moment I took this halberd from you, I took the path of the Wargod. If I make a compromise, if I speak of defeat, or if I use my body to gain peace, then would I be worthy of being the Wargod? Would I be worthy of his halberd?”

As soon as she finished speaking, a ray of dazzling light suddenly erupted from the halberd in her grasp, and then it started trembling violently.

Meanwhile, the young man said, “Big Sister, are you going to let all of us die for that so-called Wargod you speak of?”

Lady turned to look at the young man. She gazed at him for a long time, and then she shook her head, “You’re truly inferior when compared to him.”

The young man’s face instantly became unsightly. He naturally knew who Lady was referring to.

The young man spoke coldly, “Big Sister, you say he’s more outstanding than me, but so what? Did he come to help you?”

Lady paid no attention to the young man. She just gazed at her parents and said, “Father, Mother. I think that as the Wargod Clan, death isn’t the most terrifying thing for us. The most terrifying thing is losing our fearless spirit. All of you want me to marry into Wildlands Stellar Region. Perhaps it can save our stellar region, but it’s a disgrace to all of us!”

As soon as she finished speaking, she gazed at the halberd in her grasp and said, “I would rather die in battle than live in disgrace!”

“Well said!” Suddenly, a voice resounded in the sky above the continent.

The expressions of everyone here changed drastically upon hearing it.

It was the Celestial Demon Lord!

It was the Demon Lord’s voice!

It didn’t take long for a middle aged man to appear in the sky above the city. The middle aged man wore a golden robe. His figure was tall and comparable to the height of two adults, and he emanated a strand of unparalleled imposing pressure.

The Demon Lord’s gaze descended onto Zhuang Weiran, “Zhuang Weiran, I really admire you. How about we do this? So long as you agree to marry me, I’ll immediately order my forces to retreat. Moreover, I’ll even return the worlds of your Clouds of Heaven Stellar Region that I’ve conquered. Besides that, I can even help you take control of your clan. So long as we join forces, it won’t take long for us to charge into the large world!”

He would naturally not continue the attack if she was willing to marry him. Because it would be equivalent to peacefully obtaining Clouds of Heaven Stellar Region, and he would even obtain an extraordinary general.

He would gain the stellar region and her!

That was the same goal that Wildlands Stellar Region had!

Zhuang Weitian and the others were slightly tempted. They naturally knew what the Celestial Demon Lord wanted, but it was better than allowing their stellar region to vanish.

Moreover, if that happened, Clouds of Heaven Stellar Region wouldn’t be considered to have surrendered. At the very least, it would sound better as it would be called an alliance through marriage!

However, it depended on Zhuang Weiran. They wanted to force her to agree, but she was strong, so they didn’t dare to overstep their bounds.

Zhuang Weitian and the others gazed at Zhuang Weiran.

Zhuang Weiran looked up at the Demon Lord and said, “I would rather die than live in disgrace!”

Zhuang Weitian and the others’ faces instantly became unsightly when they heard her.

The Demon Lord gazed at her for a short while, and then he said, “What a pity.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he waved his right hand. In an instant, huge expanses in the starry sky above him started to tremble, and it didn’t take long for thousands to appear in the sky above the continent.

There were 6 old men behind the Demon Lord, and all of them were Deities. Besides that, there were around 70 Semi-Deities behind the 6 old men. As for the rest, the weakest amongst them were Voiders!

So many Voiders and Semi-Deities had naturally not come from Celestial Demon Stellar Region alone. There were experts from other stellar regions as well.

The expressions of everyone from Clouds of Heaven Stellar Region became unsightly when they saw the forces of Celestial Demon Stellar Region.

It was overwhelming!

Celestial Demon Stellar Region was fully capable of crushing Clouds of Heaven Stellar Region!

The Demon Lord’s gaze descended onto Zhuang Weiran, “Zhuang Weiran, I’ll give you one last chance. If you refuse, then I’ll slaughter everyone in Clouds of Heaven City once the formation is destroyed. I always keep my word!”

“Weiran!” Zhuang Weitian and the others looked at her when they heard him. Actually, everyone here was looking at her.

So long as she nodded, then war could be avoided.

Zhuang Weiran remained silent for a short while, and then she suddenly chuckled, “How sad. I never expected that there would be no one in my stellar region who has the courage to fight when the final battle is finally upon us.”

As soon as she finished speaking, she looked up into the sky, “I’m sorry. I’m going to break my promise.”

As soon as she finished speaking, a strand of faint red light suddenly surged out from within her!

Soul Ignition!

Everyone here was shocked!
