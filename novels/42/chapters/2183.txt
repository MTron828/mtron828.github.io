Chapter 2184 – I Really Can’t Go On Anymore!

The battle was still going on!

At this moment, the battle between the two sides had entered its peak.

Death!

People were dying, one after the other. This included Sages from the Alliance of All’s side and Yang Ye’s side.

Bang!

An explosion resounded, and a figure was blasted far away.

Yang Ye glanced at it, and he felt like needless were stabbing into his heart.

It was none other than Qin Chuan.

Qin Chuan suddenly gazed at Yang Ye while his figure flew, and then he cracked a smile, “Brother Yang, let’s be brothers again in our next lives. I’m leaving first.”

As soon as he finished speaking, his profound energy surged out madly, and then his body instantly expanded.

Boom!

Qin Chuan’s body exploded apart, and a terrifying wave of energy swept out. It instantly slammed against the Sage before him and obliterated that Sage.

Self-detonation!

He’d taken his opponent down with him!

Yang Ye closed his eyes slowly. Meanwhile, Mad Saber’s loud laughter resounded, “Haha! Ling, I killed a Sage first. Haha, you’ve lost. Let’s compete again in our next life!”

As soon as he finished speaking, his figure suddenly stiffened, and then his figure started falling slowly.

Ling glanced at Mad Saber’s falling body, and then he wiped off the blood on the corner of his mouth, “Slow down! I’m coming!”

As soon as he finished speaking, his figure suddenly shook violently. In an instant, countless strands of spirit energy converged toward him, and his own spirit energy started to rise madly. Countless strands of spirit energy converged within him…

Bang!

Ling’s body exploded abruptly, and a terrifying storm of spirit energy erupted like a volcano. Two Sages in front of him were blasted away. One of them was even blasted into bits while the other was heavily injured and lost the ability to continue fighting.

However, Ling was gone from this world, forever.

Meanwhile, Yu Jing’s voice resounded, “Bastards! You actually left so quickly!”

He gazed at Yang Ye and A’Man, and he continued, “Brother Yang, Sister Man, if my corpse remains intact, then don’t forget to get me a clean set of clothes. I don’t want to die covered in dirt like those bastards! Haha!”

As he roared with laughter, Yu Jing charged off into the distance.

Yang Ye closed his eyes slowly while tears ceaselessly seeped out from the corners of his eyes. Meanwhile, An Nanjing was fighting many Sages in the distance.

Bang!

Suddenly, a loud explosion resounded, and then a colossus flew off into the distance.

It was the monkey!

At this moment, the monkey had lost his right arm, and his body was covered in injuries that were bleeding incessantly. He seemed like he was wearing blood red clothes!

After he stopped himself, he gazed at Yang Ye and said, “I’ll leave my Spirit Ape Clan to you, Brother.”

As soon as he said that, the monkey roared with fury, and then he grabbed the golden rod with his left hand and shot forward.

Self-ignition!

Flames were burning all around the monkey!

He’d ignited himself!

At this moment, the monkey’s aura was unprecedentedly powerful, and it was on the verge of being on par with progenitors. As for the golden rod in his grasp, it had transformed into flames because it had been fully burned.

Self-destruction!

Finally, the monkey arrived before the Sages.

Boom!

A rumbling explosion resounded through the battlefield, and almost 17 Sages in that area were instantly obliterated!

Annihilated without a trace!

17 Sages had been obliterated without being able to fight back!

The monkey was dead as well. It was an attack he’d ignited and burned up himself to fuel.

Yang Ye slowly clenched his fists, and his nails sunk into his palm, causing blood to cover Yang Ye’s hand.

“World Eye!” Suddenly, a furious shout resounded.

Blind Maiden suddenly opened her eyes far away. In an instant, two rays of blood red light shot forward. Everywhere they passed, everything was obliterated, and two Sages were instantly burned into ashes. However, two strings of blood red seeped out from Blind Maiden’s eyes. Two breaths of time later, she turned to the side and looked downward.

The grave by the ocean.

Blood Maiden slowly stretched out her right hand, “I told you I’d come keep you company…”

As soon as she finished speaking, she closed her eyes slowly, and no signs of life were left in her.

“Third Sister!” Meanwhile, Nether Maiden howled with fury. In an instant, a chain shot forward, and it shot through the head of a Sage in front of her. Meanwhile, she was blasted away by another Sage.

An old man was watching the battle in silence from afar. Zhong Ye from the Weapon Path was by his side. This time, Zhong Ye didn’t participate, or it should be said that he’d left the Weapon Path. He’d wanted to leave when the Slaughter Line had been slaughtered all those years ago, but he wanted to rebuild the Slaughter Line. So, he hadn’t left yet. But now, when the Weapon Path acted against Yang Ye, he was truly and completely disappointed.

The old man said, “It’s horrible!”

Zhong Ye gazed at the old man, “Senior, are you not going to interfere?”

The old man shook his head, “I won’t be able to save him even if I do.”

“Why?” Zhong Ye was puzzled, “The Alliance of All and the other two paths have suffered tremendous losses. If you act now, you’ll definitely…”

“It won’t work!” The old man looked off into the distance, “Don’t forget about the god race!”

The god race!

Zhong Ye was shocked, “They…”

The old man nodded.

Zhong Ye’s face was covered in shock!

…

Meanwhile, An Nanjing suddenly stopped in front of Yang Ye, and then she turned around to look at him, “I don’t think I can hold on any longer!”

Blood seeped out from the corner of her mouth once she finished speaking.

At the same time, Yang Ye opened his eyes and gazed at her. At this moment, her right hand was in pieces, and it was because she’d overused her strength. She’d fought over a dozen Sages on her own, and some of them were even halfway into the Progenitor Realm. So, while being able to accomplish this couldn’t be described as unprecedented and impossible to replicate, she wasn’t inferior to any genius in the history of this large universe!

An Nanjing stopped, so the Sages in front of her stopped as well. She was too terrifying, and she made them feel a huge amount of pressure! So, now that she’d stopped, they had no intention to follow up with more attacks.

They didn’t have any intention to do that at all! Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

That was how strong An Nanjing was!

Yang Ye walked over to her, touched her face lightly with his right hand while he felt like needles were piercing his heart.

A farewell!

When she said that to him, she was actually saying her farewells.

Yang Ye suddenly started laughing, but his smile was quite miserable, and his laughter grew louder and louder until it filled the surroundings.

A moment later, Yang Ye’s face gradually became ferocious.

Suddenly, Yang Ye lifted his fingers and stabbed his eyes with them.

Two strings of blood sprayed from them.

Bang!

A wave of terrifying slaughter intent swept out from within him, and it surged madly like a rising tide.

“HAHAHA!” Yang Ye roared madly with laughter, “Hate! I’m so full of hate! I, Yang Ye, am so full of hate! Haha!”

His slaughter intent rose madly. In an instant, the surroundings turned blood red, and everyone felt like they were in an ocean of blood.

At this moment, everyone looked toward Yang Ye!

Amidst his roaring and insane laughter, Yang Ye’s slaughter intent increased madly. At the same time, countless strands of blood converged incessantly toward Yang Ye from the surroundings. It wasn’t just the surroundings, anywhere that blood existed in the large universe, the blood there seemed like it was summoned by something and shot up into the air before traveling through space to converge at Yang Ye’s position.

It wasn’t just blood. The slaughter intent emanated by anyone in every corner of the large universe suddenly vanished. It hadn’t really vanished, but all of it had traveled through space and converged at Yang Ye’s position.

Blood and slaughter intent were ceaselessly converging to Yang Ye.

“Slaughter intent!” The Spirit God spoke with astonishment, “This slaughter intent…”

He seemed to have thought of something, and his eyes opened wide, “This is bad! His slaughter intent is about to attain the Progenitor Realm! Stop him!”

The Progenitor Realm in slaughter intent!

All the Sages here were horrified. Once Yang Ye accomplished that, it would definitely be a disaster for them, a true disaster. After all, it was very, very difficult for them to deal with Yang Ye even now.

So, if he attained the Progenitor Realm of slaughter intent, then…

Just thinking about it was terrifying!

They didn’t hesitate to abandon their opponents and charge at Yang Ye.

All of them charged at Yang Ye!

They had to stop him from succeeding!

It was what the Spirit God and all the others were thinking right now!

“Stop them!” Suddenly, someone shouted these words.

An instant later, An Nanjing was the first to charge over while Blood Maiden and the others were behind her.

However, at this moment, the Spirit God and the others were desperate too. They were very well aware that if Yang Ye succeeded, then they wouldn’t be able to avoid a disaster. Even if they died, they had to stop Yang Ye!

When the Spirit God and the others truly started risking their lives, the battle grew absolutely intense.

Around 15 minutes later, Elysium suddenly shot out from An Nanjing’s grasp.

Hiss!

It stabbed into a Sage’s chest, causing that Sage’s body to explode apart.

Elysium flew back into her grasp. She used Elysium to support her body that was almost falling to pieces, and then glanced at Yang Ye, “I really can’t go on anymore. I can’t stay by your side anymore.”

As soon as she finished speaking, An Nanjing's eyes gradually closed.
