Chapter 1673 - The Wargod’s Arm!

Translator: InVader

Yang Lu gazed at Yang Ye for a long time before he said, “You’ll know when the time comes.”

As he spoke, he waved his right hand and both of them vanished on the spot.

Yang Xuan’s room.

At this moment, Yang Xuan had taken a knee, and a black figure wasn’t too far ahead of her.

“Those two idiots!” The black shadow spoke abruptly, “I told them to be careful of Yang Ye, but they acted so carelessly. They’re truly stupid to the extreme.”

Yang Xuan lowered her head slightly and remained silent.

A short moment of silence ensued, and then the black shadow gazed at Yang Xuan, “I know what you’re planning.”

The corners of Yang Xuan’s eyes twitched slightly, and she lowered her head even lower.

The black shadow walked over to her, “You’re waiting. You’re waiting for your older brother to show himself, right?”

Yang Xuan remained silent, but she’d slowly clenched her fists.

The black shadow added, “You want to attack me?”

Yang Xuan hurriedly said, “I dare not!”

Meanwhile, the black shadow turned around and left his or her back to Yang Xuan, “Yang Xuan, your older brother was an outstanding figure. All those years ago, the Yang Clan was practically the weakest amongst the eight clans, but it was he who allowed our Yang Clan to leap up and become an existence that’s only inferior to the Ku Clan and Ying Clan. If nothing had happened to him all those years ago, I believe that the Yang Clan would have surpassed the Ying Clan by now.”

Yang Xuan kept her head low and remained silent.

The black shadow added, “If he’s in the Yang Clan, then I would be willing to support him. Because he’s someone I respect, and because he is qualified to make me support him. However, is anyone in the current Yang Clan qualified to make me support him or her?”

Yang Xuan remained silent.

The black shadow continued, “Yang Xuan, I know that you’ve attained the Half-Step True Realm, and it’s even to the extent that you can fight True Realm experts.”

Yang Xuan’s eyes narrowed slightly, and she clenched her fists even more tightly.

The black shadow suddenly stretched out its right hand, and then the scene here changed. It didn’t take long for both of them to appear in a grey and boundless world.

The black shadow gazed at Yang Xuan, “The strong are never willing to support others, and I understand that. Come, attack me. You can choose your own future if I can’t defeat you within five moves.”

Yang Xuan remained silent for a short while, and then she stood up slowly.

Bang!

A terrifying aura surged out from within her.

The Half-Step True Realm!

Yang Xuan flipped her palm, and a spear appeared in her grasp. After that, she transformed into a ray of flaming red light that shot forward.

Meanwhile, the black shadow raised its hand and swung it down.

Hiss!

A bolt of lightning flashed, and then dazzling light surged through the entire area.

Bang!

Yang Xuan was blasted over 3km away, and her spear had been transformed into powder!

Yang Xuan looked up at the black shadow, “You’re an Ancient Inheritor!”

The black shadow placed its hands behind its back and replied, “What do you think?”

Yang Xuan remained silent.

Meanwhile, the black shadow said, “Yang Xuan, your strength isn’t the best in the Yang Clan, but your intelligence is very good. Moreover, you can lead armies. So, I need your help.”

Yang Xuan spoke in a low voice, “You might make the Yang Clan split apart. Even if it doesn’t split apart, it may suffer severe losses!”

The black shadow shook its head slightly, “You’re mistaken. If the Yang Clan is led by me, then it’ll definitely advance from its current state and rise to a higher level. However…”

The black shadow gazed at Yang Xuan and continued, “You’ve probably guessed my identity by now, right?”

Yang Xuan nodded slightly, “I have.”

The black shadow said, “If I’m in the Yang Clan, the Yang Clan will prosper; if I leave the Yang Clan, it’ll be destroyed!”

Yang Xuan’s expression changed, “What are you planning?!”

The black shadow replied, “You’ll find out in the future. Yang Xuan, I don’t like to waste my breath. I know what your objective is. You want to wait for your brother to return. So, I’ll promise you that if your brother does return, and he’s still the same Yang Wudi that he was, then I’m willing to support him. However, you have to support me until that happens. Otherwise, you must die!”

Yang Xuan fell silent for a long time, and then she answered, “I have a request!”

The black shadow said, “Speak!”

Yang Xuan looked up at the black shadow, “Let Yang Ye live.”

The black shadow replied, “I can spare him if he doesn’t try to stop me.”

As soon as the black shadow finished speaking, it transformed into a bolt of lighting that vanished on the spot.

Yang Xuan remained silent on the spot for a long time, and then she looked up at the sky, “Brother, where are you…?”

…

The Discipline Hall.

After hearing that they would give him some sort of benefits, Yang Ye had hurriedly followed Yang Lu to the Discipline Hall.

Besides Yang Lu, there were two other people here. Yang Ye knew both of them. It was the Council of Elders’ Master, Yang Lin, and the Yang Clan’s guardian, Yang Gewu!

Yang Lin spoke solemnly, “Who was that?”

He was naturally asking about the black shadow.

Yang Lu shook his head lightly, “I don’t know.”

Yang Lin’s face turned slightly gloomy, “Since that person dared to kill in the city and even did it in front of you, that person is very confident in his or her strength. But there doesn’t seem to be any True Realm expert in our clan that’s skilled in lightning! Has someone been concealing his or her strength?”

Meanwhile, Yang Gewu shook his head, “It’s probably not a True Realm expert. We guardians of the Yang Clan are fully aware of the whereabouts of our clan’s True Realm experts.”

Yang Lin suddenly said, “So it wasn’t a True Realm expert?”

Both Yang Lu and Yang Gewu’s expressions became unsightly when they heard Yang Lin. It was especially so for Yang Lu. Because he’d been at a disadvantage in both the collisions he had with that black shadow from before. In the beginning, he’d thought it was a True Realm expert. If it was a True Realm expert, then being at a disadvantage wasn’t a big deal.

But if it wasn’t a True Realm expert…

The atmosphere felt heavy.

A short while passed before they exchanged glances, and then they seemed to have thought of something, causing their expressions to grow even more unsightly.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye asked, “Old Man, where are the benefits you promised?”

Yang Lu and the others restrained their thoughts when they heard Yang Ye, and then they gazed at him. They remained silent for a long time before Yang Lu gazed at Yang Gewu. The latter pondered deeply for a moment and gazed at Yang Ye, “Are you willing to be the next guardian of the Yang Clan?”

“The next guardian of the Yang Clan?” Yang Ye frowned, “Like you?”

Yang Gewu nodded, “Like me! You’ll protect the Yang Clan until you die!”

Yang Ye hurriedly shook his head, “I’m not interested! I really am not interested!” He had better things to do than protect the Yang Clan for a lifetime.

Yang Gewu frowned slightly, “Do you know what becoming the Yang Clan’s guardian represents? It represents extraordinary status. Even the Discipline Hall can’t do anything to you.”

Yang Ye’s eyes lit up, “Really?”

The corners of Yang Lu’s mouth twitched when he saw this, and then he quickly said, “I think we should forget it. If this kid becomes the guardian of the Yang Clan, then while I can’t say if he’ll be able to protect it or not, I’m certain that he’ll throw the Yang Clan into chaos!”

Yang Ye felt speechless.

Yang Lin nodded slightly, “He isn’t suitable to be a guardian.”

Yang Gewu intended to say something, but Yang Ye suddenly cupped his fist and said, “Seniors, I don’t want to be the Yang Clan’s guardian as well. There are no benefits from it, and it’ll just give me a bunch of trouble. It’s a pain. Farewell.”

He immediately vanished on the spot once he finished speaking.

Once Yang Ye left, a moment of silence ensued here. In the end, Yang Lin spoke abruptly, “He doesn’t want to be the clan’s guardian…”

Yang Lu nodded slightly, “His aspirations are quite high!”

Yang Gewu shook his head slightly, “I think it isn’t that his aspirations are high, it’s that he doesn’t want to stay in the Yang Clan.”

Yang Lu gazed at Yang Gewu, “What do you mean?”

Yang Gewu replied, “Have you not noticed? He feels nothing for the clan. Even though everyone in this clan is connected by blood, there’s no familial bond between us. It isn’t just between us, there isn’t a connection between him and his aunt, Yang Xuan, as well. In short, he doesn’t feel a sense of belonging here!”

Yang Lu asked, “Then why doesn’t he leave the clan?”

Yang Gewu glanced at Yang Lu and said, “If he leaves, he’ll die an even worse death. I’m sure you’re aware about how many people in the clan want to kill him.” Yang Gewu paused for a moment and gazed at Yang Lin, “There are many even in the Council of Elders that want to kill him!”

Yang Lin nodded slightly, “They still have things to worry about. But once they don’t, they will definitely act against him.”

Yang Lin paused for a moment and continued, “It’s too complicated, and it’s connected to too many. Even we can’t stop it.”

Yang Lu nodded slightly and said, “I keep having the feeling that our clan won’t be at peace for long. Unfortunately, Lianshuang is a girl, otherwise…” He glanced at Yang Lin and didn’t speak further.

Yang Lin shook his head slightly, “We’re not trying to stubbornly adhere to old rules, but I’m sure you’re aware that women will get married. If she becomes the patriarch, once she grows up completely, our clan may not be the same Yang Clan anymore.”

Yang Lu shook his head slightly, “I’m just afraid that she won’t accept it willingly.”

Yang Lin stood up slowly, “She has to even if she doesn’t want to. The patriarch of the Yang Clan must be a man. Right, Brother Yang Lu, investigate that mysterious person from before. No matter who it is, since that person dared to cause trouble in our clan, then that person can’t be allowed to live.” As soon as he finished speaking, he vanished on the spot.

Yang Gewu and Yang Lu exchanged glances, and they both shook their heads.

After he returned to his abode, Yang Ye gave the fruit he got from Yang Xuan to Lu Lige. Lu Lige consumed it, and then he started meditating and recuperating. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

As for Yang Ye and An Nanjing, they returned to the Primordial Pagoda.

Yang Ye immediately went to the 4th level once he entered the Primordial Pagoda.

This time, his goal was the Wargod’s arm on the 4th level!
