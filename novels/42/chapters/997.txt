Chapter 998 – Why Would I Care?

Slaughter the entire city!

The cultivators of Ocean of Clouds City instantly turned ghastly pale when they heard him, and they looked up at the man in embroidered clothes and the black dragon with horror in their eyes.

No one felt that he was lying, and no one doubted his ability to accomplish that!

Terror! Deep terror filled their hearts!

Helplessness! Absolute helplessness washed over them!

They could fight when facing the demon beasts, and they would fight to the bloody end. However, there was only terror and helplessness in their hearts when they faced the black dragon at the Saint Realm.

“Wait!” Suddenly, the voice of the only Saint on Ocean of Clouds City’s side resounded.

Everyone looked at Zhu Yuan, and there was a trace of hope in their eyes. It was none other than because Zhu Yuan was a Saint, and he was the only Saint left on their side!

Welkin Wolf Demon King gazed at Zhu Yuan and ridiculed, “What? You finally aren’t able to restrain yourself?”

The man and black dragon gazed at Zhu Yuan as well. The man’s gaze was calm while the dragon’s eyes were filled with a vicious glow.

Zhu Yuan glanced at them and said, “From this moment onward, my Dao Order will cease to interfere in the affairs of Ocean of Clouds Academy. Disciples of my Dao Order, heed my order. Leave with me!”

Everyone in the city gazed at Zhu Yuan with disbelief when they heard this. They hadn’t expected that Zhu Yuan would actually intend to lead the experts of the Dao Order away during such a crisis! If the Dao Order’s forces left, then what would the southern gates which were defended by the Dao Order do? How would Ocean of Clouds City resist Welkin Wolf Mountain Range once Zhu Yuan left?

It couldn’t! It could only be slaughtered!

None of them had the strength to resist a Saint!

Shang Qingying spoke in a low voice from atop the city walls, “Senior Zhu Yuan, what’s the meaning of this!?”

Zhu Yuan waved his hand, “My Dao Order has already fulfilled its duty to Ocean of Clouds Academy. It isn’t necessary for us to die for the academy’s sake. No, for Yang Ye’s sake. Yang Ye has offended that man, yet he hides and refuses to show himself with the intention of making us die on his behalf. Hmph! I don’t care what your academy thinks or does. In any case, my Dao Order refuses to die for him!”

Shang Qingying said, “Yang Ye has gone to the Bear Clan to get help. He’ll be back!”

“He’ll be back?” Zhu Yuan laughed coldly, “It doesn’t take long at all to travel to and from the Bear Clan. If the Bear Clan agreed to lend a hand, then the Bear King would have brought Yang Ye back a long time ago. Since he’s not here, it proves that the Bear Clan has refused to help. As for Yang Ye.... Hmph! In my opinion, he’s hiding like a coward.”

Shang Qingying intended to continue, but Yu Wushuang waved her hand, “There’s no need to say anything else. He doesn’t want to leave because of Yang Ye. Yang Ye is just an excuse, an excuse to leave the city.”

Zhu Yuan glanced at Yu Wushuang and spoke coldly, “Little Girl, since you’ve exposed it, then I’ll just be frank. My Dao Order agreed to help Ocean of Clouds Academy, but Ocean of Clouds Academy doesn’t have any hope of victory now. My Dao Order will absolutely not give away the lives of our elites for the sake of your academy!”

Yu Wushuang gazed at Zhu Yuan and said, “There’s no need to say anything else. Just do as you wish!”

Zhu Yuan grunted coldly, and then he turned to look at the disciples of the Dao Order, “Everyone leave with me!”

“Wait!” Meanwhile, Welkin Wolf Demon King’s voice resounded abruptly.

Zhu Yuan gazed at Welkin Wolf Demon King and said, “What?”

Welkin Wolf Demon King grunted coldly and said, “Wouldn’t your Dao Order be getting off too easily if you’re allowed to leave just like that?”

Zhu Yuan, “Then what do you expect?”

A ferocious smile appeared on Welkin Wolf Demon King’s face, “You want to leave? You can. But you have to make Yang Ye show himself first. Otherwise, no one from you Dao Order can hope to leave today!”

Zhu Yuan spoke in a low voice, “I don’t know where he is!”

Welkin Wolf Demon King said, “But you definitely know how to make him show himself, right?”

The man in embroidered clothes gazed at Zhu Yuan as well upon hearing this, “Make him show himself or all of you can stay behind and be buried with him.”

As soon as the man spoke, the black dragon’s gaze locked onto Zhu Yuan while a terrifying wave of Dragon Pressure rained down and enveloped both Zhu Yuan and the other members of the Dao Order.

Zhu Yuan’s eyelids twitched. He pondered deeply for a long time before he said, “I really don’t know where he is. However, I have a way to force him to show himself!”

The man asked, “How!?”

Zhu Yuan was about to speak when Fu Jinxian suddenly said, “Elder Zhu, please reconsider. Yang Ye is a vengeful person. If he finds out that our Dao Order stabbed him in the back, then he’ll definitely take revenge. Perhaps he doesn’t have the strength to shake our Dao Order now, but he’ll definitely be able to in the future. The founding ancestor did what he did so that we would be reconciled with him. Elder Zhu, you absolutely can’t allow the founding ancestor’s efforts to be wasted!”

Fu Jinxian knew Yang Ye well, and she knew that he was definitely one who would kill anyone that dared to bring harm to him. The Dao Order would naturally have no need to fear it if it was any other person, but was Yang Ye ordinary? Would someone capable of surviving Divine Lightning of Obliteration be ordinary?

She could imagine that with Yang Ye’s potential and strength, if Yang Ye wanted to take revenge on the Dao Order, then it would definitely be a calamity for the Dao Order!

Zhu Yuan’s expression changed slightly when he heard Fu Jinxian. Even though he disliked Yang Ye, he didn’t dare underestimate Yang Ye. What a joke! Even the founding ancestor of the Dao Order didn’t dare underestimate Yang Ye, so how could he!? Moreover, he’d personally witnessed the strength and potential that Yang Ye possessed, and if Yang Ye were to be allowed to grow. No, not to mention then, Yang Ye was a threat to the Dao Order even now!

“Zhu Yuan, you’re really getting worse as you age!” Meanwhile, Welkin Wolf Demon King ridiculed, “Yang Ye is only a Half-Saint. No matter how great of a monstrous genius he is, how terrifying can he be? If it wasn’t for the protection that he receives from the Saints of the Ancient Sword School and the Ocean of Clouds Academy, killing him would be as easy as crushing an ant, right?”

Zhu Yuan glanced coldly at Welkin Wolf Demon King, and he was hesitating. Meanwhile, the man in embroidered clothes suddenly spoke, “I don’t have much patience. 10 breaths of time. If you don’t find a way to make Yang Ye show himself in 10 breaths of time, then you and those disciples of that sect of yours will die.”

Zhu Yuan gazed at the man and spoke in a low voice, “Aren’t you thinking a little too highly of yourself!?”

The man spoke calmly, “You can give it a try!”

“Roar!” Suddenly, the black dragon roared furiously, and its Dragon Pressure swept out in waves that caused even space to ripple. Meanwhile, the dragon opened its mouth and spoke, “Young Master, why waste your breath on these ants? Let me crush these ants. That fellow, Yang Ye, will definitely show himself then, right?”

Zhu Yuan’s expression changed slightly when he heard the dragon. He gazed at the dragon for a short while, and then his pupils suddenly constricted slightly as he seemed to have thought of something, “You... you’re from the Central Divine Prefecture!”

“Foolish human! Where else do you think we are from?” The black dragon looked down at Zhu Yuan from above.

The expressions of every human and demon beast here changed drastically when they heard the black dragon admit it, and this included Welkin Wolf Demon king. Even though he’d guessed it earlier, he didn’t dare say for sure. Because very few from the Central Divine Prefecture would come to Pine Prefecture. Moreover, he hadn’t imagined that someone from the Central Divine Prefecture would come here looking for Yang Ye!

Could Yang Ye be from the Central Divine Prefecture as well? Welkin Wolf Demon king thought in his heart.

At this moment, Zhu Yuan had quite the unsightly expression on his face. Because he hadn’t expected the man and dragon to be from the Central Divine Prefecture. Actually, he should have realized a long time ago. Because while there were dragons within Pine Prefecture in the past, there had never been any Saint Realm dragons in anywhere but the Central Divine Prefecture!

The Central Divine Prefecture! Zhu Yuan took a deep breath and looked at the main in embroidered clothes, and there was fear and seriousness in his eyes. No matter what rank the power which the man belonged to was, Zhu Yuan had no doubt that the Dao Order couldn’t afford to offend it. It wasn’t that the Dao Order feared the power which the man belonged to; it was just not worth it!

There was no enmity between the Dao Order and the power which the man represented. Their target was Yang Ye, so the Dao Order had absolutely no reason to go against the man!

When he thought up to this point, there was no hesitance left in Zhu Yuan’s eyes, “There is a way to force Yang Ye to show himself. He’s a very loyal person. If you capture someone he cares about and spread news about it, then he’ll definitely rush back here no matter where he is!” ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Fu Jinxian sighed softly when she heard him. She knew that the Dao Order was enemies with Yang Ye once again!

On the other hand, Yu Wushuang and Lu Wan’er’s expressions changed slightly. They had no doubt that Zhu Yuan was speaking about them!

The man frowned slightly, “People he cares about?”

Meanwhile, Welkin Wolf Demon King pointed at Lu Wan’er and Yu Wushuang, “Those 2 women!”

The man looked along the direction Welkin Wolf Demon King was pointing towards, and he immediately noticed Yu Wushuang and Lu Wan’er. However, it didn’t take long for his gaze to descend onto Oblivion Maiden who stood by Yu Wushuang’s side. His relaxed brows were pressed together again when he saw her, and a long time passed before he said, “You feel familiar to me!”

The gazes of everyone here descended onto Oblivion Maiden when they heard him, and then they watched as Oblivion Maiden glanced at him before lowering her head to look at the fox in her arms.

She’d completely disregarded him!

Everyone almost felt their jaws hit the ground when they witnessed this scene. They had never imagined that a seemingly weak and fragile woman would actually dare to disregard the man in embroidered clothes who was from the Central Divine Prefecture.

My god! He’s standing on a Saint Realm dragon!

Unexpectedly, the man didn’t flare up. Conversely, he had a trace of seriousness and bewilderment on his face.

The man took a deep and long glance at Oblivion Maiden, and then he looked at Zhu Yuan, “I disdain to act against women, so you do it. You can leave once Yang Ye arrives, understand?”

Zhu Yuan’s face was quite unsightly. After all, when had he even been threatened like this? However, he didn’t dare to resist. Because it wasn’t just the disciples of the Dao Order who would die before the joint forces of the black dragon and Welkin Wolf Demon King, even he would perish here!

Zhu Yuan pondered deeply for a moment and spoke solemnly, “Daofu, capture them!” It was naturally not good for a Saint like him to act against 2 weak women.

Meanwhile, Qing Daofu hesitated for a moment before his figure shot towards Yu Wushuang and Lu Wan’er. Even though he didn’t want to do this, he knew that the disciples of the Dao Order would die if they refused!

Suddenly, something unexpected occurred. A ray of light shot down from the sky and arrived in an instant.

After the light dispersed, everyone here was slightly stunned.

Suddenly, Welkin Wolf Demon King, the man, the black dragon, and Zhu Yuan seemed to have noticed something, and then swiftly looked down to the ground.

At this moment, Qing Daofu had stopped on the spot, and a man was standing in front of him. The man held a sword in his grasp, and that sword was placed against Qing Daofu’s neck while threads of blood were slowly seeping out from Qing Daofu’s neck.

Yang Ye!

As soon as they recovered from their shock, the cultivators on Ocean of Clouds Academy’s side felt overjoyed! Yu Wushuang and Lu Wan’er heaved sighs of relief as well, but there was a complicated expression in their eyes. Because they didn’t want Yang Ye to come back. Yet now, he had, and he’d come back alone. So, they felt that he’d just come back to give his life away!

Meanwhile, Oblivion Maiden’s gaze descended onto Yang Ye. She sized him up before lowering her head and patting the fox which was sound asleep in her arms. She spoke softly, “A’Li, we’ll be able to go home soon!”

“Yang Ye, don’t be rash!” Zhu Yuan was shocked when he saw Yang Ye’s sword against Qing Daofu’s throat, and he hurriedly said, “We can talk about this. Qing Daofu is a genius of my Dao Order, and he’s the future hope....”

Hiss!

Suddenly, a ray of cold light flashed, and then Qing Daofu’s head flew into the air.

Yang Ye withdrew his sword and gazed at Zhu Yuan who was burning with rage, “Why would I care about that?”
