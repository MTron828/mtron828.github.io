Chapter 1779 – Unprecedented Attainments In The Sword!

When he comprehended ‘True’ his sword intent had attained the True Rank, and even his slaughter intent could attain the True Rank at any moment!

However, he’d never used either of them.

Moreover, he was even trying to forget them at all times!

Because he didn’t want the True Rank of sword intent or slaughter intent, he pursued the essence of the sword.

So, when he thought up to this point, Yang Ye replied, “Senior, I want to pursue the essence of the sword.”

“How pedantic!” Ling Xiu spoke coldly, “How foolish! Why do you possess sword intent? Because of the sword. You only have sword intent because of the sword. So, sword intent and the sword are one. Is there even a difference between them?”

Yang Ye was stunned on the spot.

Right!

Sword intent is formed from the sword, so they are one. It can’t be considered to be an external force!

Once he thought up to this point, Yang Ye cursed himself for being foolish. After all, his attainments in the Sword Dao were formidable. If his sword intent rose a level higher, then his attacks wouldn’t just be able to pose a threat to 5th stage True Realm experts, it would even be a threat to 6th stage True Realm experts!

Yang Ye wasn’t able to stay calm once he thought of this!

Meanwhile, Ling Xiu said, “Are you tempted?”

He gazed at her and replied, “Senior, we’re all straightforward people here. So, tell me what you want!”

She nodded slightly, “It’s nothing special. I just hope that you’ll protect my Secret Sect in the future!”

Yang Ye glanced at her, “Are your feelings for the Secret Sect that deep?” Amongst the 6th stage True Realm experts he knew, most of them cared about nothing but their own life and death.

Ling Xiu nodded slightly, “This isn’t just a sect, it’s my home.” She glanced at the other pillars, “Do you know how they died?”

Yang Ye shook his head.

She explained, “Actually, it’s very difficult for experts at their level to die. Even some cultivators would find it difficult to kill them. However, they’ve still perished. It wasn’t because someone killed them, it’s because they took their own lives!”

Yang Ye frowned while a puzzled expression filled his eyes, “They took their own lives?”

Ling Xiu nodded slightly, “Every single time the seal loosens, the experts of my Secret Sect will use the strength they accumulated throughout their life to fortify the seal.”

A wisp of surprise flashed through Yang Ye’s eyes. Isn’t that a little too selfless?

Ling Xiu asked, “Are you very surprised?”

Yang Ye nodded, “Extremely!”

She spoke softly, “Once the seal is broken, my Secret Sect will definitely be annihilated!”

Yang Ye spoke in a low voice, “I dare not guarantee that I’ll be able to deal with him!”

She nodded, “But you have a chance!”𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Why?”

Ling Xiu looked him in the eyes, “Because that sword chose you.”

Yang Ye’s face stiffened. It didn’t take long for him to shake his head. Actually, he wanted to say that it wasn’t following him, and it was with Snowy, so Snowy should go seal the head.

Meanwhile, Ling Xiu spoke abruptly, “Do you know what lies above the True Rank of intent or the True Realm of cultivation?”

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts and gazed at her, “Please do tell!”

She replied softly, “After the Zenith is truth, and after truth, it’s enlightenment.”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Enlightenment?”

Ling Xiu nodded, “The heart is clear like a mirror that can see through all things. The True Realm is one where the essence of all things is understood, and the Enlightened Realm doesn’t just cover the understanding of the essence of all things, it represents seeing through all things. They are very similar concepts, but there are differences. Just like water and ice. They are similar, but different!”

Yang Ye spoke solemnly, “How do I attain it?”

She shook her head slightly, “There are no shortcuts. You can only observe and comprehend!”

“Observe and comprehend?” Yang Ye gazed at her, “I know how to comprehend, but how should I observe?”

Ling Xiu replied, “I attained the Enlightened Rank in the past, and I left behind images. You can observe those!”

Yang Ye was astounded, “You were at the Enlightened Rank?”

She shook her head, “Only in intent and not cultivation. So, perhaps I can help your sword intent and slaughter intent attain the Enlightened Rank. Of course, I dare not guarantee it. All of this depends on a person’s fortune!”

Yang Ye nodded, “Thank you!”

Meanwhile, Ling Xiu gazed at Yun Qian, “Join him!”

Yun Qian had astonishment written all over her face.

Ling Xiu explained, “He’s right. I shouldn’t judge a person based on natural talent and potential. Since you’re here and have made your choice, then there’s fate between us. So, what you obtain depends on your own fortune!”

Yun Qian quickly bowed respectfully, “Thank you, Sect Master Ling.” She gazed at Yang Ye and continued, “Thank you!”

She knew that if Yang Ye hadn’t said all of that, Ling Xiu wouldn’t have accepted her.

Yang Ye smiled and didn’t say anything. As far as he was concerned, he’d only lifted a finger.

Meanwhile, Ling Xiu suddenly waved her hand. In an instant, the scene around them changed, and then they appeared in a pitch black room. There was a woman seated cross-legged in the room.

It was Ling Xiu!

Comprehend!

Ling Xiu was comprehending right now!

Yang Ye and Yun Qian exchanged glances. Suddenly, their expressions changed because they noticed that some sort of link had formed between them and Ling Xiu. It only took a moment for them to realize that they were actually able to sense everything that Ling Xiu was sensing!

“It’s a type of inheritance technique!” Suddenly, Ling Xiu’s voice resounded in their minds, “It allows people to form a type of spiritual bridge between them, so they’re able to sense everything about each other for a short while. It only lasts for two hours. What you obtain depends on your own fortune!”

The voice vanished after speaking those words.

Yang Ye immediately closed his eyes and immersed his mind into it. In next to no time, he sensed himself merging into one with Ling Xiu. It could be said that so long as he willed it, he could find out everything about Ling Xiu, including all her secrets. However, he didn’t do that.

One had to know one’s limits.

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts and focused on sensing what Ling Xiu was sensing.

At the 1st level of the pavilion.

There was a screen of light before Ling Xiu and the old man in a luxurious robe. Yang Ye, Yun Qian, and the past Ling Xiu were displayed on the screen.

The old man suddenly asked, “Sect Master Ling, can he save our Secret Sect?”

She shook her head, “He can’t!”

The old man was astounded, “Then….”

She gazed at Yang Ye through the screen and spoke softly, “That head dropped down from the large universe. It was heavily injured when it arrived, but the various experts of our Secret Sect and even Wu Mu weren’t able to kill him. So, it’s obvious that the head definitely belonged to one of the earliest ancient cultivators!”

She paused for a moment and continued, “But Yang Ye is just at the True Realm, so how can he deal with that head?”

The old man asked, “Then why are you and Sect Master Su Mu helping him?”

She gazed at Yang Ye for a long time before she replied softly, “Who said we’re helping him?”

The old man fell silent.

A long time passed before the old man laughed bitterly, “Actually, there was a person who could kill that head. Unfortunately….”

Ling Xiu spoke softly, “The Unfettered One?”

The old man nodded, “What do you think about him?”

She fell silent for a long time before she replied, “Unprecedented attainments in the sword and a figure unrivaled through history!”

…

In the room, Yang Ye and Yun Qian were still seated cross-legged, and they were still comprehending.

Actually, it was more precise to say that they were sensing what Ling Xiu sensed when she comprehended her intent all those years ago. Now, Ling Xiu was using a technique to pass her experience to them.

It was naturally extremely beneficial to Yang Ye and Yun Qian. Because it allowed them to avoid straying off the right path.

The reason the disciples of clans and sects were able to grow much faster than independent cultivators was because they rarely strayed off the right path. It was because they had the guidance of others when they took the path of cultivation!

Just like that, time trickled by, and it didn’t take long for two hours to pass.

At this moment, Yang Ye and Yun Qian had returned to the pavilion.

However, they were still seated cross-legged and hadn’t opened their eyes.

Ling Xiu glanced at them and said, “Don’t disturb them!”

She entered the pillar of light once she finished speaking.

Around 15 minutes later, Yang Ye vanished on the spot.

In the Primordial Pagoda.

Yang Ye naturally intended to cultivate in the Primordial Pagoda. After all, ten days in the pagoda was just one day in the outside world. Of course, he didn’t let his guard down. Qiong Qi was ready to fight at any moment, and he would attack if he noticed even the slightest suspicious movement!

Qiong Qi’s strength was even sufficient to resist a 6th stage True Realm expert for some time!

While the old man in a luxurious robe was surprised that Yang Ye had vanished, he didn’t do anything. Everyone had their own secrets, and Yang Ye naturally had some.

Just like that, time trickled by.

It didn’t take long for a month to pass in the outside world.

At this moment, Yun Qian had opened her eyes. There was a trace of delight in them. Even though her cultivation hadn’t improved, her mental state had improved tremendously. Such improvement was superior to years of bitter cultivation!

Suddenly, Yang Ye appeared by her side.

Yang Ye had opened his eyes as well.

Yun Qian was stunned when she saw Yang Ye, “What… what happened to you...?”
