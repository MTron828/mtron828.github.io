Chapter 137 – I’ll Make You Feel Moved!

“There are over 6,000 energy stones, two mid-grade Profound Rank Dark Treasures, seven low-grade Profound Rank Dark Treasures, two scrolls of low-grade Profound Rank techniques, nine scrolls of high-grade Yellow Rank techniques, and over 100 high-grade Yellow Rank spirit herbs. Right, there are also over 10 low-grade talismans of the five elements....” Qin Xiyue smiled as she said to Yang Ye, “This spatial ring probably belongs to Xu Yan from the Origin School because the techniques here belong to the Origin School.”

Yang Ye said hastily, “Quickly take a look at the other rings!”

Qin Xiyue nodded, and then she inspected the contents of the other spatial rings.

In next to no time, all the spatial rings had been inspected. When Yang Ye found out about their gains, he couldn’t avoid feeling excited and delighted even with his current wealth.

Their gains this time consisted of one high-grade Profound Rank Dark Treasure, 11 mid-grade Profound Rank Dark Treasures, 17 low-grade Profound Rank Dark Treasures, one scroll of a high-grade Profound Rank technique, six scrolls of low-grade Profound Rank techniques, 16 scrolls of high-grade Yellow Rank techniques, a single high-grade Strider Talisman, 17 mid-grade talismans, and 27 low-grade talismans.

Besides these material treasures, there were also over 10,000 energy stones. Of course, they’d obtained far more than this. But besides all of these treasures, the two of them didn’t regard the rest as valuable at all.... Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

After a moment of excitement, Yang Ye calmed down and asked. “Just these things are probably not enough for us to establish an organization, right?”

“Of course not!” Qin Xiyue rolled her eyes at Yang Ye and said, “Do you think establishing an organization is so simple? However, even though it’s insufficient, if all of these things are sold, and if some of the businesses that I possess in the capital are included, then we can start establishing the organization. However, the expenditure after that will only grow larger and larger. You have to be mentally prepared for that. Right, you’re a Talisman Master, so this is probably not too difficult for you!”

If she was said to be completely devoid of any confidence in Yang Ye’s intent to establish an organization, then she could be said to have seen a little hope when she found out that Yang Ye was a Talisman Master. However, it was only a little....

Yang Ye remained silent for a short while, and then he withdrew 25 high-grade talismans. He thought for a moment before he withdrew the blood red blade and techniques that he’d obtained from Bloodhand. He passed them to Qin Xiyue and said, “There are 25 high-grade talismans here. Choose some and keep them for yourself, and then auction off the rest. This blade and these techniques are from the Ghost Sect. I’m unable to use them, so sell them as well!”

In the past, he was unable to utilize these things after he obtained them, and he had no way to sell them as well. Now, he just happened to be able to pass it to this woman to auction off.

Qin Xiyue glanced at the blood red blade and the scrolls, and then she gazed at Yang Ye for a short while. After that, she broke out into a smile and said, “Aren’t you afraid that I would take these treasures of yours and take them for myself?”

When she spoke up to here, she shook her head lightly and chuckled. “I forgot that two strands of my soul are with you.”

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment before he closed his eyes slightly. After a short while, two black strings gradually moved out from within his body. He opened his eyes and said, “These are those two strands of your soul, take them back!”

Even though this woman would be under his control while her soul was in his possession, Yang Ye knew that utilizing such a method to maintain the collaboration between them would definitely fail. At the very least, it would definitely not work for this intelligent woman that stood before him. Since it was like that, it was better to be generous and form true friendship and trust between them!

She gazed at the two black strings that seemed as if they were alive, and then Qin Xiyue gazed at Yang Ye as she said seriously, “Do you know that possessing these two strands of my soul is equivalent to controlling my life. In other words, it’s equivalent to possessing a puppet at the King Realm. Do you really intend to give them back to me?”

Yang Ye said seriously, “Do I look like I’m joking?”

“Why are you doing this?” asked Qin Xiyue.

Yang Ye smiled and said, “I hope I’ll be able to make you feel moved, and then work for me wholeheartedly.”

he’d never thought of speaking any touching words because those words would definitely be unable to deceive this woman. Since it was like that, it was better to be frank.

“Do you realize that I would still work wholeheartedly for you even if you didn’t give them to me? Moreover, I wouldn’t even dare to have any other thoughts. However, once you return these strands of my soul to me, numerous choices would open themselves up to me,” said Qin Xiyue.

“Perhaps!” Yang Ye shrugged and said, “At the very beginning, I didn’t want to collaborate with you because I didn’t trust you. Even though I’m still unable to trust you completely, we can be considered as friends at the very least. On the other hand, if I have your soul in my control, then we can’t be considered as friends, and there would be something that stayed in between and separated us. Don’t you think so too?”

Qin Xiyue gestured with her hand, causing the two black strings to fly back into her body. After a short while, she gazed at Yang Ye and said, “Are we only friends?”

“Are we not?” Yang Ye hadn’t finished speaking when Qin Xiyue suddenly embraced him, and then she pressed her red lips against his lips. Such a scene didn’t continue for long. Qin Xiyue had merely pecked his lips lightly before moving away.

After that, she smiled as she said, “Little Brother, you’ve accomplished your objective. Big Sister has truly been moved by you. Look, Big Sister was moved to the point of almost giving herself up to you!”

Yang Ye was stunned for a moment, and then he laughed bitterly when he recovered from his shock and said, “Don’t do that in the future.”

Even though it was he who gained, he felt that it wasn’t right. As for what wasn’t right, he was unable to put his finger on it, and it was merely a feeling....

“Looks like you’re quite loyal to that person you like!” Qin Xiyue smiled as she said, “Little Brother, looks like Big Sister has to educate you on polygamy in the future. Otherwise, you’ll definitely abandon Big Sister for that woman!”

“Let’s not speak about all of this!” Yang Ye shook his head and said, “Let’s split up right here and right now. You return to the Grand Qin Empire first because I still have some matters to attend to in the Grand Myriad Mountains. Right, if I want to contact you in the future, how would I go about doing that?”

“You intend to stay in the Grand Myriad Mountains?” Qin Xiyue restrained the smile on her face and frowned as she said, “If I’m not wrong, then at least three Spirit Realm experts are pursuing us right now. Even though you have that mysterious little fellow to conceal your aura, it doesn’t represent that you’re absolutely safe. What if they catch up to you? You would be in huge trouble!”

Yang Ye grinned and said, “It’s fine, even an Exalt Realm expert wouldn’t dare go to the place I intend to go to. That place is absolutely safe. As for you, even though the Grand Myriad Mountains doesn’t pose any danger to you, you have to watch out for that nephew of yours after you return to the Imperial Capital. I don’t want something to happen to you before you’ve even started to establish the organization.”

“So long as I return to the Imperial Capital, then I’ll have plenty of ways to deal with him!” A cold light flashed in Qin Xiyue’s eyes.

Yang Ye said in a low voice, “Don’t do anything stupid. If you make an appearance right now, then he’ll definitely use your mother to threaten you. There’s no rush to save your mother for now. I’ll be participating in the Ascension Rankings a few months from now, so how about we make plans to rescue your mother then?”

“You’re participating in the Ascension Rankings?” said Qin Xiyue with surprise.

Yang Ye nodded and said, “I’ll be representing the Sword Sect during the Ascension Rankings, and it’s extremely important!”

“But you said you aren’t a disciple of the Sword Sect....”

“I’m not representing the Sword Sect for the sect, and it’s for a single person in the Sword Sect instead!” said Yang Ye.

“A woman?” asked Qin Xiyue.

Yang Ye nodded.

Qin Xiyue continued. “That woman you like?”

“Can we not discuss this?” Yang Ye was slightly speechless.

“Of course!” Qin Xiyue smiled and said, “But Big Sister is very curious. Exactly what sort of woman is capable of making Little Brother constantly think of her! Alright, don’t put on such a face, I won’t speak about this anymore. Actually, since you said you’re going to participate in the Ascension Rankings, then Big Sister will wait for you at the Imperial Capital, and if you’re able to ascend into the Ascension Rankings, then it would be much easier for me to rescue my mother!”

“The more outstanding I am, the greater your hopes of rescuing your mother are?” asked Yang Ye.

Qin Xiyue nodded and smiled. “Of course. After all, I eloped with you. If you’re able to ascend to the top 20 of the Ascension Rankings, then even the imperial household would be unable to nitpick about you. At that time, I would rise in status because of you. So, not only would the imperial household avoid punishing me, it would even attach importance to me. This can’t be helped, this is reality. When someone possesses potential or value, then all the mistakes of that person would become meaningful things....”

Yang Ye really wanted to say that his objective wasn’t the top 20 but the first.... However, he thought about it for a moment and didn’t say anything in the end. After all, this objective seemed to be too unusual.
