“No!!!!” Yu Wushuang’s voice suddenly resounded from atop the city walls.

At this moment, the others behind her were terrified out of their wits.

The beautiful woman and the inner court students were stunned as well. That insufferably arrogant instructor of the outer court is dead, just like that? He was killed with just a swing of a dagger?Once Leng Yuran and the others recovered from their shock, they were about to charge off the city walls when the beautiful woman obstructed their path. All of them were furious, but the woman suddenly said, “He’s still alive!”

They looked over and saw that Yang Ye’s hand was holding onto the black robed woman’s dagger, but blood was still flowing from his neck....

Bang!

A strand of terrifying sword intent swept out from within Yang Ye, and it instantly blasted her over 30m away.

Yang Ye turned around to gaze at the woman, and there was an extremely solemn expression in his eyes. After all, he’d almost died just now. Actually, her dagger had pierced through the skin on his neck, but it hadn’t been able to slice through the meridians and veins within his neck. Because he’d grabbed it at the critical moment!

So long as he was a little slower, just a little bit, then his head would have left his body!

“3rd level Heaven Rank sword intent and a powerful physical body. You’re really surprised me quite a bit!” said the black robed woman.

“It’s impolite to not return the favor. Try a swing of my sword as well!” As soon as he finished speaking, the Herculean Sword carried 3rd level Heaven Rank sword intent as it transformed into a ray of light that shot forward explosively. The powerful sword intent and aura it carried caused the space before it to split apart, and the demon beasts in the surroundings were pushed back repeatedly!

The woman’s eyes narrowed slightly, and then her figure vanished on the spot. At the same time, Yang Ye’s sword energy suddenly vanished, and then over a dozen strands of blood sprayed out from him.

The expressions of everyone watching from above the city walls changed drastically when they witnessed such a shocking scene!

Bang!

Yang Ye’s 3rd level Heaven Rank sword intent surged out from within him once more, and it formed a powerful barrier of sword intent around him. After that, he stomped his right foot against the ground, and his figure shot around 30m back.

Yang Ye looked down at his body, and he saw countless blood red injuries on himself. Moreover, every single one of them was extremely deep to the bone!

Yang Ye raised his head to look at the black robed woman who’d returned to where she stood earlier, “The Laws!”

At this moment, he understood why her strength was so terrifying. It was because she possessed the energy of a Law. However, he didn’t know which Law it was. But he had no doubt that it was an extremely powerful and mysterious Law!

“Your sword intent isn’t bad, and so is your body. However, that’s all you’re good for!” The black robed woman waved her dagger around, and then her figure flashed back into the army of wolves.

In next to no time, a howl resounded from within the army, and then the white wolf led countless other wolves in a charge towards the city walls.

“Aowu!” The white wolf howled furiously. Its figure grew larger and larger as it dashed forward, and it became the largest amongst the wolves here in less than 2 breaths of time. It was an entire 300m tall and was still growing in size!

There were countless frenzied wolves behind it!

“Quickly get back in the city!” Yu Wushuang and the others spoke anxiously from above the city walls.

A ruthless expression flashed through Yang Ye’s eyes as he gazed at the army of wolves that was charging towards him. He flipped his palm, and the ancient sheath appeared in his grasp before he sheathed a sword within it.

After that, he drew it swiftly, “Slash!”

As soon as he spoke, a sword howl shot into the sky, and then a ray of sword energy carried 3rd level Heaven Rank sword intent as it swept forward from Yang Ye. Moreover, not only was it carrying 3rd level Heaven Rank sword intent, it was enhanced by the Critical Strike technique and Lightspeed technique, and it was formed from 20 overlapped Heavenrends!

Yang Ye swiftly stomped his foot against the ground and instantly entered the city once he drew his sword. Meanwhile, almost 10,000 demon beasts behind him were slashed into 2, and an endless torrent of blood sprayed into the air while miserable howls resounded incessantly.

However, it didn’t take long for those miserable howls to be drowned out by the furious howls and footsteps from the army.

The black robed woman’s eyes narrowed slightly as she gazed at Yang Ye who had already entered the city, and there was ghastly killing intent in her eyes.

Yang Ye had just got onto the city walls when Yu Wushuang and the others surrounded him, and their eyes were filled with concern.

Yang Ye shook his head to indicate that he was fine.

Bang!

Meanwhile, the city walls started to tremble violently, and some cultivators were caught off guard and almost fell off the city walls.

Everyone’s expressions changed, and they shot their gazes towards the area outside the city walls. At this moment, countless wolves were madly smashing themselves against the city walls under the white wolf’s lead. Especially the white wolf. At this moment, its body was as huge as a mountain, and it was almost as tall as the city walls. Every single time it smashed its body against the walls would cause both the walls and the ground to shake, and it didn’t take many collisions for cracks to start appearing on the walls!

All of them were astounded when they witnessed this scene. After all, if the city was breached, then everyone within the city would be killed. Because they would definitely be no match for the army of demon beasts once they lost the city walls.

The woman suddenly gazed at Yang Ye and said, “The old man said that you possess full authority for the defense of the main gates. So, what do we do now?”

Yang Ye glanced at the area outside the wall and the dense ocean of wolves there. At this moment, the formation and cannons on the city walls weren’t very effective against the army of demon beasts. Because there were truly too many of them, and a new pack would immediately arrive after the last one was annihilated. Moreover, many cannons had been damaged by the army!

So, Ocean of Clouds City was at a complete disadvantage!

Yang Ye spoke solemnly, “How many high rank Half-Saints do we have on our side?”

She replied, “Around 100. However, they can’t join the battle because they’re keeping the high rank Half-Saints of Welkin Wolf Mountain Range busy. Once there’s no one to keep them busy, then they would probably only need an hour to breach the city with their joint strength!”

Yang Ye suddenly gazed at her and asked, “Do we have anything else up our sleeves?”

She nodded, “However, we can’t use those trump cards. Because they are our last resort. If we use them now, then we’ll be helpless to stop the army when they launch a full-scale attack!”

Yang Ye said, “Actually, I don’t know anything about defending a city. If you have any suggestions or methods, then feel free to tell me. I’ll assist you on it!”

She glanced at him and nodded. Actually, she was waiting for him to say that.

Her gaze descended onto the white wolf, and she said, “If I’m not wrong, that wolf should be one of the Welkin Wolf King’s 5 sons, but I don’t know which one he is. I’m sure you’ve realized that his attacks are extremely destructive. If he’s allowed to continue, then it’ll take 4 hours at most for the formations to be destroyed. Once we lose the formations, then the city walls would be like pieces of paper before those demon beasts! So, we must stop him!”

“What about the other demon beasts?” Yang Ye asked, “Even if that white wolf is taken care of, we still can’t stop that ocean of wolves!”

The beautiful woman pondered deeply for a moment before she said, “So long as you can stop that white wolf, then you can leave the rest of the demon beasts to us. I can’t annihilate all of them, but I can push them back for now.” Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Yang Ye glanced at her and asked, “What’s your name?”

She was slightly stunned by this, and then she answered, “Shang Qingying.”

Yang Ye nodded and said, “Dealing with that white wolf isn’t a problem for me. The problem is that black robed woman. I’m sure you noticed that she’s quite mysterious. She’ll definitely launch a sneak attack against me if I head out to deal with the white wolf. Do you have any ideas on how to deal with her?”

Shang Qingying’s gaze descended onto the black robed woman. A long time passed before she spoke solemnly, “She’s probably Sky Divine Hall’s You Wuying!”

When she spoke up to this point, she gazed at Yang Ye and said, “Besides Shangguan Yunhai, no one within the academy can stop her. But Shangguan Yunhai isn’t here now.”

“Sky Divine Hall’s You Wuying?” Yang Ye frowned. He hadn’t expected her to actually be from Sky Divine Hall.

Shang Qingying nodded and said, “She can be considered to be the 2nd strongest expert beneath the Saint Realm within Sky Divine Hall. Her strength is only inferior to Lou Qianxiao. Right, she’s his wife as well. So, she’s the Divine Empress of Sky Divine Hall. I never expected Sky Divine Hall to actually send her here. Looks like it’s really planning something big!”

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly. Her strength was truly quite formidable. Not only could she break through his physical defenses with ease, she had even comprehended a mysterious Law. But even then, she couldn’t compare to Lou Qianxiao. So, he could imagine how strong Lou Qianxiao was!

But so what!? No matter how strong he is, he’s still a human, and he can be killed!

Yang Ye feared no opponent, but he didn’t underestimate any opponent as well.

Meanwhile, the violet mink suddenly appeared in front of Yang Ye, and then she pointed at the white wolf before pointing at herself.

Yang Ye frowned, “Are you sure that you can deal with him?”

Zi’er was furious when Yang Ye doubted her, and she flickered over to the top of his head. She grabbed both his ears and started pulling on them.

“Alright, alright. I believe you, I believe you....” Yang Ye quickly took her down from his head and said, “Be careful, alright? Right, I’ll send a dragon to help you. Remember that you must flee if you can’t win. Don’t force yourself. I’ll smack your butt until it’s swollen if you dare to let yourself get hurt!”

The violet mink flushed red, and then she glared at Yang Ye with embarrassment before flashing out of the city.

After she left the city, the violet mink’s body instantly enlarged almost 100 times, and she wasn’t smaller than the white wolf at all. Moreover, there was a long pair of violet wings on her back!

The white wolf immediately stopped attacking when he saw the violet mink, and besides a vicious glow, there was a trace of seriousness in his eyes!

The violet mink waved her huge claw, and a ray of violet light instantly descended onto the top of the white wolf’s head.

Bang!

The white wolf howled with pain as it shot backwards.

Yang Ye’s heart eased up slightly when he witnessed this scene, and then he shot his gaze towards the black robed woman. The black robed woman shot her gaze towards him as well, but her eyes were completely tranquil.

It was disregard!

“Your Laws are mine!” Yang Ye spoke in a voice that only he could hear, and then he stomped his right foot against the ground and transformed into a ray of light that shot out from the city.

A sword howl resounded as the ray of light tore through the sky!
