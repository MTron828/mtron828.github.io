Chapter 202 – Borrow The Little Fellow?

The expressions of everyone changed when they heard this. All the Darkbeasts have gathered? In the opinions of all the profounders here, this news was undoubtedly like a thunderclap that descended from a cloudless sky. After all, the strengths of the Darkbeasts were superior to humans. So, if humans fought them with numbers and tricks, then they would still have a chance. But now, the Darkbeasts had converged together. So, what did that mean? It meant that all the participating profounders were doomed!

Qin Youran said in a low voice, “All the Darkbeasts have gathered already?”

Yuan Tong nodded lightly and said, “This year’s Ascension Ranking can’t be compared to the past. This time, all the King Rank Darkbeasts on Ascension Mountain Range have stopped fighting alone as they have in the past, and they’ve united just like us human profounders have. Everyone, I presume I don’t have to speak any further about how terrifying Darkbeasts that have united would be, right?”

“Why have the Darkbeasts acted so unusually this time?” It was Li Xianjun who asked this question.

“There are two reasons!” Yuan Tong said, “The first is because an extremely monstrous Darkbeast has appeared in the Darkbeast Empire. I don’t know which clan it’s from. In any case, its strength made the elites of all the four great Darkbeast Clans of the Darkbeast Empire to submit to him. The second reason is that according to rumor, one of us humans possesses a mysterious King Rank Darkbeast. Besides the four great Darkbeast Clans, practically all the other Darkbeasts in the Grand Myriad Mountains are unable to resist its bloodline pressure!”

When he spoke up to here, Yuan Tong suddenly turned to look where Yang Ye stood and said, “Friend from the Sword Sect, what do you think?”

When they heard Yuan Tong, the gazes of everyone shot towards Yang Ye in unison. No, it should be said that their gazes had shot towards the violet mink on Yang Ye’s shoulder!

Yang Ye’s expression changed. He’d always thought he’d hidden the little fellow very well, yet he’d never imagined that others had found out a long time ago. But how did Yuan Tong find out? Yuan Tong glanced at the violet mink on Yang Ye’s shoulder, and then he said, “You’re that mysterious King Rank Darkbeast, right? It’s truly unimaginable that your ability to conceal your aura can actually deceive me!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he gazed at Yang Ye and said, “You’re that Yang Ye who killed a King Realm expert and fought a Spirit Realm expert?”

Since he’d been exposed, then there was no need to conceal it. Yang Ye nodded and said, “I can’t figure it out. Why would you have paid attention to me? I’ve always been keeping a very low profile!”

“A low profile?” Yuan Tong suddenly shook his head and smiled before he said, “Yang Ye, the death of the members of my Origin School, the Ghost Sect, the Flower Palace, and the Sword Sect at the Tomb of Emperor Zhou is related to you, right?”

The expressions of the members from the Ghost Sect, Flower Palace, and Sword Sect changed when they heard this, and their gazes towards Yang Ye became hostile!

Yang Ye remained completely indifferent to these gazes, and then he chuckled and said, “If I’m not wrong, the disciples of your Origin School, the Flower Palace, the Sword Sect, and the Ghost Sect were all led by King Realm expert. Could a tiny little Mortal Realm profounder like me go against four King Realm experts? I do remember that it was a Spirit Realm expert from your Origin School who was standing on guard outside the tomb, right? Could it be that your Origin School killed everyone and intends to push the blame on me?”

When they heard Yang Ye, all of them looked at Yuan Tong again. Needless to say, Yang Ye’s words really made sense. After all, Yang Ye wasn’t at the First Heaven Realm then, so how could he possibly kill four King Realm experts?

Many people didn’t notice that merely the Flower Palace’s Wenren Yue’s gaze was still on Yang Ye. If she hadn’t had that battle with Yang Ye, then she would think that the incident in the Tomb of Emperor Zhou was absolutely not his doing. But now....

Yuan Tong shook his head and said, “I have no intention to pursue that matter. Presently, a life and death battle is about to occur between us human profounders and the Darkbeasts from the Darkbeast Empire. It poses a huge threat to Darkbeasts, so I want to borrow it, alright? With it by my side, I’ll definitely be able to greatly reduce the losses that we human profounders suffer!”

“Why waste your breath on him. There are so many of us, could it be that he would dare to not lend it to us? In my opinion, we should ask him to tell us how he controls Darkbeasts. In this way, would we humans have to fear Darkbeasts?” Qin Youran spoke coldly from the side.

“Brother Qin is right!” Meanwhile, the Ghost Sect’s Li Xianjun chimed in. “Since Brother Yuan said that this little fellow is a great threat to the Darkbeasts of the Grand Myriad Mountains, then we should just seize it from him. If he resists, then we’ll just kill him!”

“HAHAHA!” Yang Ye roared with laughter. He laughed for a while before he gazed at Qin Youran and Li Xianjun before he said, “Just kill me? I’m right here! Will both of you fight me one by one, or perhaps you intend to join forces?”

“Join forces?” Qin Youran said with disdain, “Against you? Don’t’ think that you can act arrogantly before me just because you’re able to kill a King Realm expert! Believe it or not, I’ll finish you in 10 moves!”

“I don’t!” It wasn’t Yang Ye that spoke these words, and it was Wenren Yue from the Flower Palace instead. She gazed at Qin Youran and said indifferently, “Qin Youran, if you’re able to finish him in 10 moves, then I’ll give you my high-grade Earth Rank Jadecloud Ring. If you’re unable, then give me that high-grade Earth Rank Land Diagram of yours, alright?”

Qin Youran’s eyes narrowed before he said, “Your Jadecloud Ring is mine!”

As soon as he finished speaking, his figure suddenly vanished on the spot and instantly arrived in front of Yang Ye. After that, he blasted his fist towards Yang Ye’s head. Moreover, it was so swift that countless people in the surroundings weren’t able to clearly see how he vanished and arrived in front of Yang Ye.

When he saw Qin Youran attack, a wisp of a savage expression crept onto Yang Ye’s face. He didn’t waste his breath and smashed his fist forward as well. Yang Ye had never feared anyone in a clash of fists!

Bang!

An explosion resounded before Yang Ye and Qin Youran instantly moved backward. Yang Ye had taken two steps back while Qin Youran had taken five instead!

An expanse of exclaims resounded in the surroundings when they saw this. Obviously, no one had imagined that Yang Ye could actually fight Qin Youran and gain the upper hand!

At this moment, Qin Youran’s expression was extremely unsightly. He’d never imagined that he would actually be blasted back by a nobody from the Sword Sect. This was a humiliation to him!

When he thought up to here, a wisp of ghastly killing intent flashed through Qin Youran’s eyes, and he said, “I underestimated you earlier. I never expected that you would possess some ability. However, since I said I’d finish you in 10 moves, then I will!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he took a step forward while the profound energy within his body surged into his right arm. The clothes on his right arm instantly exploded into pieces. At the same time, a thick layer of ice crystals covered his arm.

In the next moment, Qin Youran shouted loudly as he made a slapping motion towards Yang Ye from afar. Instantly, an enormous ice palm formed from profound energy instantly blasted down towards Yang Ye.

At the same time, his figure flashed. He left a string of afterimages behind as he followed closely behind the ice palm and charged towards Yang Ye.

Everywhere the ice palm passed, even air was instantly frozen, and numerous enormous blocks of ice appeared in the surroundings.

“It’s the low-grade Earth Rank combat technique — A Thousand Leagues of Snow!” Murong Yao revealed a rather solemn expression when she saw that enormous ice palm. On the other hand, Situ Rong smiled coldly. He’d disliked Yang Ye since the beginning, so he felt that it would be a good thing if Yang Ye died at Qin Youran’s hands!

When that ice palm arrived in front of him, Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed as Violet Spirit instantly left its sheathe, and he swiftly slashed it towards the enormous ice palm! Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

He’d see through its weak point at the moment when Qin Youran executed this technique, but he’d still chosen to destroy it by force. Because he didn’t want to expose too many of his trump cards. After all, numerous monstrous geniuses were staring at him from the surroundings!

Bang!

Violet Spirit instantly slashed through the icy palm. However, Yang Ye’s expression changed right after that. Because Violet Spirit had actually been instantly frozen. Moreover, ice was spreading at an extremely swift speed. In an instant, it had arrived on his hand, and then a layer of ice crystals started spreading throughout his entire body at an alarming speed. In less than the time for a single breath, Yang Ye had become an ice statue!

Right at this moment, Qin Youran had arrived in front of Yang Ye, and then his fist that was covered in ice smashed forcefully towards the center of Yang Ye’s forehead!

Murong Yao was about to make a move. However, she hadn’t even done anything when a cold man from the Imperial Academy locked onto her and caused her to not dare make any rash movements!

Right when Qin Youran’s fist was about to strike the center of Yang Ye’s forehead, a sword howl suddenly resounded. A strand of dazzling violet light suddenly erupted from Violet Spirit that was originally frozen in Yang Ye’s hand, and then it flashed towards Qin Youran’s chest like a bolt of lightning!
