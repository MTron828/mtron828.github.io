Chapter 2438 – I’ll Let You Swing at Me 5 Times!

Fuck off!

Her words resounded throughout the area, and it was extremely calm!

The old man gazed at her with a wisp of ridicule on the corner of his mouth, “Do you know who you’re speaking to?”

He’d assumed an air of superiority!

The old man was like a wealthy man coming to the slums when he arrived here from Eternal Kingdom, so he couldn’t avoid feeling superior to everyone here. However, it was normal because Five World Realm experts were absolutely rare in Eternal Border.

The young girl didn’t say anything and just stretched out her right hand in his direction, “Ruin!”

Crack!

The space around him was torn open!

The old man’s expression changed, “Impossible…”

As soon as an expert took action, their skill would be obvious!

The old man was shocked. He stopped underestimating her and raised his hands slowly. In an instant, rays of light appeared around him. Even if the space around him was being obliterated, the old man and the light remained.

Suddenly, the young girl vanished on the spot.

The old man looked up abruptly and slammed his fist out!

A very simple punch!

However, it was exactly such a punch that made the waters of Eternal River roil, and countless auras within the river started shivering!

The old man had suppressed his strength when executing this punch. If he didn’t, it would obliterate the entire Eternal River.

A tiny palm suddenly stopped his fist!

In an instant, the space here froze!

Everything froze!

Just like that, around 10 breaths of time passed, and then the old man suddenly took numerous steps back. He only stopped when his back slammed against the Universe Wall.

However, the wall behind him shook violently and countless cracks appeared on it.

The old man looked up at the young girl, “Who are you?!”

She didn’t say a word and just took a step forward, and then she made a grasping motion in the old man’s direction. In an instant, countless rays of dark light appeared around him.

The old man’s eyes narrowed slightly. He was about to attack when she swiftly arrived before him and slammed a punch at him!

The old man’s pupils constricted and slammed a punch forward in response!

Their fists collided, and countless rays of dark light descended upon the old man!

Boom!

An explosion resounded and the old man’s body slammed against the Universe Wall, causing it to tremble violently before countless cracks stretched out through it.

Meanwhile, a wisp of blood seeped out from the corner of his mouth.

Suddenly, the young girl raised her right hand and pressed it down in the old man’s direction.

Bang!

The old man’s body started to warm, and the wall behind him cracked open. After that, it vanished slowly.

The passageway had been opened!

The old man wiped off the blood on the corner of his mouth and looked at her, “Even the weak dare to bully me when I’ve suppressed myself! You…”

Suddenly, the young girl attacked once more.

Bang!

The old man’s body cracked open and blood sprayed!

The old man was shocked and hurriedly fled back into Eternal Kingdom. At the same time, a voice came from Eternal Kingdom, “Woman, do you dare to come in here and fight me?!”

Fight him in Eternal Kingdom!

Because the old man feared certain existences, he had to suppress his cultivation in Eternal Border, but Five World Realm experts were allowed to fight in a place like Eternal Kingdom. It could be said that he was only truly able to display his strength in Eternal Kingdom!

The old man was naturally uncomfortable. How could he lose to someone from Eternal Border?

The young girl ignored the old man as she stood before the wall. She turned around and looked into the sky. Her gaze passed through boundless space, and she saw a familiar figure. There was a white little fellow on that figure’s shoulder.

As if she’d noticed something, the white little fellow shot a glance to the side, but only bewilderment filled her eyes.

A short while later, the young girl moved her gaze away and spoke softly, “I’ll see you in Eternal Kingdom!”

As soon as she finished speaking, she turned around and entered Eternal Kingdom. As soon as she did that, the wall behind her appeared once more, and it was completely whole again!

The young girl walked forward, and every step she took caused her aura to grow slightly stronger. Her aura gradually strengthened to the point it reached the peak of the Four World Realm. A few breaths of time later, it was at the Five World Realm!

The space here started rippling!

However, her aura was still rising madly!

It didn’t take long for her to notice the old man from before. He was at the Five World Realm now, the true Five World Realm.Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

The old man was stunned for quite some time when he saw her, and then he spoke with disbelief, “Impossible… That kind of world could never give birth to someone like you…”

The young girl glanced at him and vanished on the spot.

“AHHH!” Shrill cries resounded incessantly.

A long time passed before a corpse laid there before her. It was the old man’s corpse!

She glanced into the distance and said, “Is this Eternal Kingdom?”

She started walking off slowly into the distance.

Around 10 breaths of time later, a white haired old man and three middle aged men appeared here. The old man gazed at the other old man’s corpse in silence. It didn’t take long for him to look into the distance, and he saw a young girl there. As if she noticed his gaze, she suddenly stopped and looked back at him.

The young girl had her hands behind her back, and she gazed at him with coldness and indifference, “Want to give me a try?”

Try!

The old man’s eyes narrowed slightly. But he still didn’t attack after a short while passed, so a wisp of ridicule arose on the young girl’s lips as she walked away.

She walked away confidently!

One of the middle aged men behind the old men asked, “Elder Qin?”

The old man closed his eyes slowly, “The third in the 10 great physiques, the Artificial Dao Body!”

The Artificial Dao Body!

The other middle aged men’s pupils constricted while astonishment filled their eyes.

A very, very long time ago, there had been a type of physique, the Natural Dao Body. It was a rarely seen physique, and it could be described as a blessing from the gods. When it came to cultivating, what took another 100 years may only take the owner of a Natural Dao Body 1 year! Moreover, there would be no barriers on their path of cultivation! Nor would they be suppressed by the world!

A physique like that was very, very terrifying!

However, the Natural Dao Body was only ranked fifth among the 10 great physiques!

The Artificial Dao Body was ranked higher than it!

The Artificial Dao Body was a physique that was cultivated by a cultivator, and it wasn’t obtained naturally. Simply speaking, it was like the difference between someone who inherited wealth and someone who made their own wealth. The person who inherited it had everything at birth, they were born with a silver spoon. But people who made their own wealth obtained it slowly through their own hard work. So, there was a fundamental difference between them!

At most times, those who inherit their wealth find it difficult to start from nothing, but that’s not the same for those who make their own wealth. For example, the royals who inherit the throne. The emperor who started the empire would never be a useless weakling, but those who inherit the throne may be useless.

So, the Artificial Dao Body was rarer and stronger! It was something that had been cultivated step by step!

The old man didn’t dare to attack her because he’d discerned her physique! Someone capable of that was definitely not easy to deal with!

Just like that, they watched as she went further and further before vanishing completely from their fields of vision.

The old man withdrew his gaze and looked down at the old man’s corpse. He shook his head and gazed out of the all into Eternal Border, “Sprite Progenitor, don’t fall into the desolate race’s hands.”

Once he finished speaking, he was about to leave with the others, but he suddenly looked toward the wall of light. The Universe Wall suddenly cracked open!

The old man’s pupils constricted to the size of needless when he witnessed this!

Just like that, they watched as a sword cultivator in a cloud white robe walked out from behind the wall.

The sword cultivator walked slowly toward the white haired old man’s group!

The old man’s eyes narrowed slightly as he wondered when the Universe Wall had become so weak to the point that just anyone could enter Eternal Kingdom?

It didn’t take long for him to grow close to the old man’s group, but he just glanced at them and moved his gaze away.

Calm!

The sword cultivator’s gaze was calm, and it represented that he wasn’t interested in them!

However, the old man was quite interested in him and obstructed his path.

The sword cultivator’s face was calm as he gazed at them, and the old man sized up the sword cultivator. Or to be more precise, he sized up the sword cultivator’s sword.

It wasn’t a Divine Treasure, nor was it a Super Divine Treasure!

It was an ordinary sword!

A very ordinary sword!

The old man was very confident about his appraisal of it. The sword was an absolutely ordinary sword.

The sword cultivator suddenly asked, “Do you need something?”

The sword cultivator’s indifference made the old man quite uncomfortable. Shouldn’t those people from the outside world be humble here? Moreover, there weren’t many Five World Realm experts out there, but he was a Five World Realm expert!

Actually, it was just because the sword cultivator’s indifference and calmness made him feel uncomfortable.

He’d ignored them!

It was such an absurd feeling, the sword cultivator seemed to be ignoring them!

So, the old man spoke indifferently, “Draw your sword!”

As if he’d thought of something, he added, “I’ll let you swing at me 5 times! Go on!”
