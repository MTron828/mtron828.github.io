Emperor Zhou glanced at Yang Ye, and then glanced at Xuan’er that stood before him. In the end, his gaze descended onto Yang Ye as he said, “Kid, even though you’re merely at the First Heaven Realm now, your potential is enormous. You’re very suitable for the daughter of I, Yin Zhou, and I hope that you’ll take good care of her in the future!”

“Senior....” Yang Ye was just about to say something when Yin Xuan’er glared at him from the side, causing him to swallow back the explanation he was about to provide. Now, he had a slight understanding of the woman’s motives behind saying that she would marry him. When he thought up to here, Yang Ye glanced at Yin Xuan’er as he’d never expected that this woman hadn’t brought him to gain treasures and benefits at all!

Emperor Zhou sized Yang Ye up and said, “You’ve already focused on the Sword Dao, so my inheritance isn’t suitable for you. However, your physical body seems pretty good, and I have a body refinement technique and a fist technique that are very suitable for you!”

As he spoke, Emperor Zhou flicked his finger, and two scrolls flew to Yang Ye.

Yang Ye was delighted in his heart, and he bowed to Emperor Zhou before he took the scrolls. After that, his gaze descended onto the scroll in his left hand first.

Mid-grade Earth Rank combat technique, Dragonbreaker. Grasping the fist is like grasping authority and striking forcefully with the fist is like possessing authority. A man can’t do without authority for a single day....

Emperor Zhou said, “This technique, Dragonbreaker, is something I created myself when I was young. It only has a total of three moves. The first move, Armorbreaker. The second move, Earthshaker. The third move, Dragonbreaker! According to legend, the defensive capabilities of dragons is the greatest in the world. Unfortunately, the dragon race has already vanished from the southern territory. Otherwise, I would really like to see if my Dragonbreaker is capable of breaking through the defense of dragons!”

Yang Ye seemed to have been affected by this man’s heroic spirit, and he said with a smile, “If I have the opportunity to encounter a member of the dragon race in the future, I can give it a try!”

A wisp of a smile flashed on Emperor Zhou’s face, and he said, “Not bad, as expected of the person my daughter took a liking to. Remember, the Dragonbreaker stresses upon the strength of the body. The stronger your body is, the greater its strength would be. That body refinement technique has numerous methods to improve the body, and it’s just slightly painful. However, I presume it would be nothing to you. Kid, remember what I said. Take good care of my daughter!” As he spoke, his figure started to fade gradually.

“Imperial Father!” Tears flickered in Yin Xuan’er’s eyes.

Emperor Zhou grinned and said, “I’ve already fulfilled my wish, so it’s time to vanish. Xuan’er, I know that you intend to take revenge for your mother, and I won’t stop you. However, I want to tell you. Now that you’ve escaped your fate of being sealed here, I only hope that you’ll be able to live on safely.” As soon as he finished speaking, Emperor Zhou’s figure grew faint before completely dispersing in the air.

From this moment onward, a peerless expert had completely vanished from the world!

Yin Xuan’er didn’t cry nor did she speak, and she just stared blankly at the coffin....

Yang Ye opened his mouth from the side, yet he didn’t speak any words of consolation in the end. He knew that this woman before him didn’t need any consolation at all, and all she needed was to calm down by herself.

“Congratulations Little Brother, you didn’t just gain a delicate and gorgeous beauty, you even obtained a combat technique and cultivation technique!” Meanwhile, Qin Xiyue suddenly smiled as she spoke to Yang Ye. However, her voice carried a trace of sourness. It was unknown whether she was jealous of Yin Xuan’er, or because all the benefits were gained by Yang Ye alone.

Yang Ye passed the scroll that contained Dragonbreaker to Qin Xiyue and said, “If you want to cultivate it, then we can cultivate it together.”

“You’re serious?” Qin Xiyue gazed at Yang Ye as she spoke.

“Do you think I look like I’m joking?” said Yang Ye. Yang Ye had naturally not fallen in love with Qin Xiyue. The reason he was so generous was because of his own personal reasons in the end. Firstly, he didn’t want a misunderstanding to form between them. Secondly, the stronger this woman was, the more beneficial it would be to him.

Qin Xiyue gazed at Yang Ye for a short while before she cracked a smile and said, “Little Brother, Big Sister was just testing you. This combat technique stresses upon physical strength. Big Sister isn’t suitable to cultivate it. But Big Sister appreciates your good intentions!”

“This is a mid-grade Earth Rank combat technique. Do you really not intend to cultivate it?” asked Yang Ye.

Qin Xiyue shook her head and said, “Big Sister’s body isn’t strong, so cultivating this combat technique would be utterly useless.”

“How generous of you!” Right at this moment, Yin Xuan’er turned around, and she gazed at Yang Ye as she said with ridicule, “You’re even willing to share an Earth Rank combat technique because of a woman!”

“Xuan’er....” Yang Ye was just about to say something when Yin Xuan’er’s face turned cold, and she said, “Are you even worthy of calling me Xuan’er? Do you really think that I would marry you?”

As soon as she finished speaking, she looked at Qin Xiyue while killing intent flashed in her eyes, and she said, “A member of the Grand Qin Empire’s imperial household? So, in this way, you’re a princess?”

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed while his gaze turned cold. After a long time, he took a deep breath and said, “Miss Yin, I know that you just lost someone very close to you, and it’s unavoidable that you’re in a bad mood. I understand that, but the matter between you and Xiyue....”

“I want to kill her. Will you help me or her?” Yin Xuan’er interrupted Yang Ye and spoke.

“Yin Xuan’er, it’s better to make friends than enemies. There’s truly no need for you to act in this way....”

“So, it means that you will help her, right?” Yin Xuan’er ridiculed and said, “To think that someone promised my Imperial Father earlier that he would take care of me. You took my Imperial Father’s treasures yet intend to help others to oppose me.”

Yang Ye’s expression changed. He didn’t even give it any thought before he tossed the two scrolls in his hand to Yin Xuan’er, and he said, “Miss Yin, in my opinion, you truly don’t need anyone to take care of you. As for these two techniques, Yang Ye doesn’t deserve it, so I’ll return them to you!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye turned around and said to Qin Xiyue, “Let’s go!”

Qin Xiyue and Yin Xuan’er were stunned. Both of them had never expected that Yang Ye would give up these two techniques because they were Earth Rank Techniques! Earth Rank Techniques!

Qin Xiyue was the first to recover from her shock. When she gazed at Yang Ye, her eyes carried an extreme trace of an incomprehensible emotion, and she said with a smile, “Will you not reconsider? That’s two Earth Rank Techniques. Why give them up because of rage?”

“Rage?” Yang Ye was stunned, and then he shook his head and said, “Even though Earth Rank Techniques are precious, but so what about that? Should I make a move against you just for these Earth Rank Techniques? Perhaps others would be capable of doing so, but not me!”

Qin Xiyue gazed at Yang Ye for a short while before she cracked a smile and said, “Not you indeed! Little Brother, you really made Big Sister look at you in a different light!”

Truthfully speaking, Yang Ye’s actions had truly impressed her. It was two Earth Rank techniques, and it was something that countless Profounders would fight madly to obtain. Not to mention that she’d merely known Yang Ye for a few days, even father and son would probably fight to the death for it. However, Yang Ye gave it up without the slightest hesitation.

Actually, Yang Ye felt slight pain in his heart right now. But he didn’t regret his actions. Even though he was a selfish person, he felt that one should persist in some things. In other words, every single person should have a limit that they wouldn’t cross when doing things!

Yang Ye shook his head and stopped thinking about this. He said, “Let’s go. This can be considered as a warning to me that I shouldn’t just go around with the little fellow!”

“Are you feeling regret for saving me?” At this moment, Yin Xuan’er spoke coldly.

Yang Ye smiled and said, “Speaking about that is completely meaningless now. Miss Yin, see you next time.”

“Do you think you can leave without me?” said Yin Xuan’er.

Yang Ye didn’t answer her. He glanced towards the surroundings, and he said after a short while, “So, this place is an illusion as well. How realistic!”

As he spoke, he stretched out his hand to grab Qin Xiyue’s hand, and then with a command in his heart, his sword left its sheath and swiftly slashed towards a point in space.

Yang Ye didn’t know why he’d seen through this place and realized it was an illusion. He only knew that there was something very off about this place, and it was a form of intuition. His intuition told him that this place was an illusion!

Right at this moment, a white light flashed before Yin Xuan’er appeared in front of Yang Ye and Qin Xiyue. At the same time, Yang Ye’s sword had been grabbed by her. She said, “Don’t destroy this place. We’ll leave together!”

Yang Ye was stunned, and then he nodded and said, “That’s naturally for the best!”

He owed Emperor Zhou a debt of gratitude for providing him with guidance. So, unless he had no other choice, otherwise, Yang Ye didn’t want to destroy this place as well.

With a spin of her body, Yin Xuan’er had returned to her original form. After that, she shot towards Yang Ye’s chest. However, she hadn’t approached Yang Ye’s chest when she was blasted away by an invisible force.

Yin Xuan’er returned to her human form and looked at Yang Ye as she said, “What’s the meaning of that?”

“Miss Yin, what are you doing?” Yang Ye frowned as he asked.

Yin Xuan’er said, “I’m naturally going in. Didn’t we form an agreement earlier?”

She seemed to have thought of something, and she swung her fair hand, causing the two scrolls to fly towards Yang Ye before she said, “I can go in now, right?”
