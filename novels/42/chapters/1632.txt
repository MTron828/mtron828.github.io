Chapter 1633 - Guess When You’ll Die!

Translator: InVader

Six types of Returnal Rank intents!

Yang Ye was stunned as well. After all, An Nanjing’s intent had been at the Rebirth Rank previously. Yet now, they’d advanced into the Returnal Rank. Moreover, all six of them had been merged together!

My god! Yang Ye felt absolutely embarrassed right now. After all, he only possessed two types of intents, but An Nanjing possessed six!

Meanwhile, The Grand Elder appeared here, and he stared at An Nanjing without blinking. There was excitement, happiness, and a trace of regret in his eyes.

He knew An Nanjing possessed six types of intents, but at that time, her intents were only at the Rebirth Rank. The Rebirth Rank and the Returnal Rank were two completely different things.

At this moment, he finally understood why their ancestor said that the younger generation of the Wu Clan couldn’t compare to her.

They couldn’t! They really couldn’t!

It could be said that if An Nanjing came to the Wu Clan ten years earlier… No, just three years earlier, then there would definitely be a spot for her in the top three of the younger generation throughout the medium universe of Milky Way System!

The Grand Elder took a deep breath, and then an extremely amiable smile appeared on his face, “Miss An, according to my knowledge, your intents were only at the Rebirth Rank. Why are they at the Returnal Rank now?”

Yang Ye gazed at An Nanjing because he wanted to know the answer as well.

An Nanjing pondered deeply for a moment and replied, “I gained comprehension upon looking through the Wu Clan’s ancestor’s experiences, and so they improved.”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

The Grand Elder’s expression was quite weird as well. She just looked through a compilation of experience and attained the Returnal Rank…

He’d looked through it as well. Even though he’d comprehended many things, that was all he’d gained!

This was the difference between an extraordinary genius and an ordinary genius!

Meanwhile, An Nanjing gazed at Yang Ye, “Shall we continue?”

Yang Ye gazed at the Grand Elder. The latter nodded and vanished on the spot.

Once the Grand Elder left, An Nanjing gazed at Yang Ye, “Be careful!”

As soon as she finished speaking, she shook her hand slightly, and her spear shot forward like a bolt of golden lightning.

Skysplit that was enhanced by six types of Returnal Rank intents!

Everywhere it passed, space warned before it. Moreover, the space in a huge area around Skysplit was actually rippling incessantly, and the space right at the center of Skysplit’s path was actually gradually cracking apart!

A solemn expression appeared on Yang Ye’s face. He didn’t dare act carelessly and issued a command in his heart. His sword floated around 1m away from him to the side while he slowly clenched his right fist. A moment later, he slammed it forward!

Heaven Obliteration!

A wave of terrifying force that carried the intent to obliterate surged out from Yang Ye’s fist.

Bang!

In an instant, rumbling that shook the sky surged and resounded through the entire training grounds. At this moment, the entire training grounds was shaking like an earthquake had occurred!

Meanwhile, An Nanjing had vanished on the spot, and she was behind Skysplit when her figure appeared again. After that, she tapped her left foot down and leaped up into the air before kicking Skysplit’s handle with her right leg.

Hiss!

Skysplit instantly transformed into a golden bolt of lightning that flashed forward. It was so swift that Yang Ye wasn’t even able to react before it arrived in front of him, and the powerful force it carried caused the space around him to crack open!

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly. He stretched out his hand and his sword immediately flew back into his grasp. At the same time, an ancient sheath appeared in his left grasp. He sheathed his sword and immediately drew it!

Heavenrend!

Ten overlapped Heavenrends!

After he attained the Rebirth Realm, Yang Ye’s Heavenrend had improved tremendously. He could overlap ten Heavenrends now, but it was also his limit for now.

Yang Ye didn’t know how strong ten overlapped Heavenrends were, and he really looked forward to finding out.

He was about to find out right now!

Om!

A sword howl shot up into the sky, and then a ray of light flashed.

Space cracked apart in the wake of Yang Ye’s sword energy!

The spear and sword energy slammed against each other.

Clang! Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

The spear shook violently, and then An Nanjing and Yang Ye respectively appeared behind their spear and sword. However, An Nanjing was slightly faster. She grabbed Skysplit and immediately stabbed it forward. So, when Yang Ye finally grabbed his sword, he had no choice but to raise it and block her attack!

Clang!

Yang Ye was blasted far away. Meanwhile, An Nanjing tapped the tip of her foot down, and then numerous images of her appeared here. All of them were her afterimages, and the most terrifying part was that they seemed real.

Meanwhile, An Nanjing’s body had appeared in front of Yang Ye, and then Skysplit swept towards him from left to right.

This time, Yang Ye didn’t try to block it, and he just stabbed his sword towards her stomach!

He intended to exchange injury for injury!

If it was anyone else, his attack would definitely be lethal, but he was facing An Nanjing, and they would definitely not kill each other. So, if their attacks were about to strike a lethal blow, then they would definitely stop it!

The reason he chose to exchange blows with An Nanjing was because he had no other choice. Her instinct in combat was truly too formidable. Even he who possessed the Enlightened Sword Heart was only barely able to fight her in close quarters. If it was anyone else, that person would probably be dead by now.

After all, even though An Nanjing hadn’t used any techniques, her moves were even more terrifying than techniques!

Every move of hers was lethal!

An Nanjing frowned when she noticed that Yang Ye intended to suffer an injury in order to land a blow, but it didn’t take long for her brows to relax. A moment later, a wave of terrifying intent surged out from within her. The force of Yang Ye’s sword was instantly suppressed by it. At the same time, she charged forward and slammed her fist at his chest.

Bang!

A muffled bang resounded, and then Yang Ye was pushed backwards repeatedly. Meanwhile, An Nanjing suddenly appeared in front of Yang Ye while holding Skysplit in her grasp, and then it shot forward swiftly like thunder!

Fortunately, Yang Ye was able to react. He immediately sheathed his sword, drew it, and swung it. However, An Nanjing’s spear sped up abruptly and moved sideways slightly. This movement caused it to instantly strike against the hilt of Yang Ye’s sword, causing Yang Ye to be blasted over 3km away before he could even draw his sword!

A moment later, An Nanjing shot forward once more!

The Grand Elder gazed at Yang Ye, and there was a trace of praise in his eyes. Because as far as he was concerned, it was very shocking that Yang Ye had been able to fight An Nanjing for so long.

After all, she possessed six intents! Actually, as far as he was concerned, the most terrifying part about her wasn’t those six intents, it was her instinct in combat!

An Nanjing’s combat instinct was something that even struck slight terror in his heart!

That was why he felt like that about Yang Ye. It was because while Yang Ye was being suppressed by her instinct in combat, he was able to resist her until now and frequently counterattack!

However, the Grand Elder felt that it was only a matter of time before Yang Ye lost!

Boom!

Suddenly, a muffled explosion resounded from afar. The Grand Elder looked over and saw Yang Ye had been blasted over 6km away. However, An Nanjing didn’t press her advantage and attack again. She stopped instead.

An Nanjing gazed at Yang Ye, “Are you not going to use your trump cards?”

Yang Ye glanced at his right hand. At this moment, he couldn’t feel his right hand. An Nanjing’s combat instinct wasn’t the only thing which was strong, her speed and strength were horrifying as well. Especially her control of her strength, it was terrifying!

Yang Ye looked up at her and smiled, “Let’s just stop here, alright?”

He had more trump cards, of course. They were the Laws of Darkness, the Sword of Rebirth, and the Sword Domain. Especially the Sword Domain. Even though An Nanjing had six Returnal Rank intents, his Sword Domain could still suppress them!

Even though he knew she definitely had trump cards too, and he wanted to see what they were, he didn’t want both his and her trump cards to be exposed before the Wu Clan. Trump cards that were exposed weren’t trump cards anymore.

One had to always keep something up one’s sleeve!

An Nanjing glanced at Yang Ye and nodded, “Alright!” Obviously, she understood what he meant.

Yang Ye smiled, “I’m going to the Yang Clan. Are you coming?”

An Nanjing pondered deeply for a moment and replied, “Go ahead without me. I haven’t finished learning a move.”

Yang Ye was slightly stunned and asked, “What move?”

She replied, “You’ll know when the time comes.”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and nodded, “Then I’ll be going first. Take care.’

She suddenly went over to Yang Ye, looked him in the eye for a long time, and said, “I will!”

Yang Ye smiled, “Alright, I’ll be waiting for you!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he vanished into the distance.

Once Yang Ye left, the Grand Elder appeared before An Nanjing and said, “Miss An, the patriarch would like to meet you. So…” He suddenly looked towards the distant sky and spoke with surprise, “He’s actually here…”

…

Yang Ye didn’t stay in Martial Origin System. The Yang Clan’s fight for succession was about to begin in half a month, so he didn’t have much time left.

It didn’t take long for Yang Ye to leave Martial Origin System. However, as soon as he left it and arrived in the starry sky, two old men appeared before him.

A ferocious expression instantly appeared on his face when he saw them. Because they were the two experts who’d come to Sky Sky Continent to kill him and took Little Sky’s soul!

They were Yang Shan and Yang Shi.

Yang Shan’s gaze descended onto Yang Ye, “Come, let me guess. Which young master do you belong to? The Seventh Young Master? The Fourth Young Master? Or perhaps…”

Suddenly, Yang Ye said, “Come, guess when you’ll die!”
