Chapter 2719 – Instant Kill!

Eternal Kingdom.

At this moment, Eternal Kingdom had fallen, and the desolate race’s army had entered its borders.

The entire world was in a mess. Of course, there were tons of corpses and blood all over.

The War Dimension.

The War Dimension was the only place in the Eternal Kingdom that hadn’t been conquered by the joint forces of the desolate race and the entire universe. Besides fostering geniuses, this place existed as a backup plan for the Eternal Kingdom.

Countless powerful formations were gathered here, and they had been ceaselessly reinforced for a very, very long time. Now, they were extremely terrifying.

It could be said that even killing peak Destiny Realm experts wasn’t difficult for these formations.

Moreover, after they gave up their territory and shrunk their line of defense by converging all their experts here, and coupled with the formations here, it was the only way they could stop the desolate race’s advance.

However, Eternal Kingdom had fallen. Now, the War Dimension had temporarily stopped the desolate race, but if they received no assistance, it was only a matter of time before the desolate race got them. After all, the desolate race had surrounded the War Dimension!

In the War Dimension.

All of them had converged in the city, and they could see countless formations circulating in the sky above.

Outside the War Dimension.

The desolate race and the experts from all over the universe were gathered out here. They would naturally not spare the War Dimension.

Once they eliminated the War Dimension, the history of this universe would be rewritten!

Huang Ying stood in the sky outside, and the undying race’s patriarch, Huang Buer, and Huang Xuan were by his side. Besides that, countless other experts from all over the universe were behind him.

Once they found out that Eternal Kingdom had been breached, the experts of the universe stopped watching and rushed over with the intention of benefitting from the scraps of the war.

Huang Ying didn’t refuse it because Eternal Kingdom still had the War Dimension, and it had to be eliminated to put an end to all future troubles. Now that these people were here, he was naturally happy to welcome them. After all, he had countless more cannon fodder to use!

In the sky.

Huang Xuan suddenly asked, “Shall we begin?”

Huang Ying gazed at Huang Buer, and the latter spoke solemnly, “These formations are very powerful. It will probably take a long time to break through them.”Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Huang Ying smiled, “It’s fine. We have time.”

Huang Buer was about to speak when a ray of sword energy descended in the distance.

The expressions of everyone here changed. The forces behind Huang Ying were about to attack, but he stopped them.

It was because the figure in the distance belonged to Yang Ye!

Huang Ying, Huang Buer, and Huang Xuan’s expressions were quite unsightly at the sight of Yang Ye.

Was Yang Ye here to help?

If Yang Ye was here to help, they would be in big trouble!

Yang Ye was fighting the End World right now!

But even the End World couldn’t kill him!

Their expressions grew increasingly unsightly as they thought about it!

Yang Ye glanced at Huang Ying’s group, and then he walked toward the War Dimension. However, he stopped a short moment later and gazed at Huang Ying, “Can you spare the sprites of this world?”

Huang Ying gazed at Yang Ye, “Yes.”

He would naturally not refuse. Only the End World could stop Yang Ye now. While the desolate race had practically won the war against the Eternal kingdom, the situation would instantly turn around if Yang Ye took the Eternal Kingdom’s side!

So, the desolate race didn’t dare to refuse Yang Ye’s request. Fortunately, it wasn’t an excessive one either!

Yang Ye nodded and walked toward the War Dimension. Once he got close to it, the formations there instantly activated. At the same time, a barrier appeared before Yang Ye.

Yang Ye withdrew Great Unknown, and then he passed through the barrier.

All barriers were nothing before Great Unknown!

Huang Ying and the others were stunned by the sight of this.

He got through just like that?

Just like that?

They exchanged glances and saw bewilderment in each other’s eyes.

…

In the War Dimension.

A ray of sword energy suddenly descended before the gates of War City.

At this moment, countless experts appeared above the city walls, and they seemed like they were facing a formidable enemy when they saw Yang Ye’s figure.

Meanwhile, Liu Yuan appeared before Yang Ye.

Liu Yuan glanced at Yang Ye with a rather complicated expression on her face. This fellow before her had once been a part of the War Dimension! If the Eternal Kingdom hadn’t treated Yang Ye like that, Yang Ye would still be part of the War Dimension, and the situation would be different!

Yang Ye said, “Tell the Soul Sect’s master to come here!”

The Soul Sect’s master!”

Liu Yuan’s eyes narrowed slightly, “Yang Ye, are you trying to strike us when we’re down?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “Senior Liu Yuan, am I doing something like that? I don’t think so! Tell him to come out here, and we’ll resolve our enmity on our own.”

She spoke solemnly, “Yang Ye, Eternal Kingdom is already in this state. If you act against us, you’ll be pushing us to death.”

Yang Ye smiled, “A long time ago, didn’t Eternal Kingdom do the same to me?”

Liu Yuan fell silent.

Yang Ye shook his head, “Allow me to be honest. Even if you win, they still must die.”

He looked at the city, “The patriarchs of the various clans and the Eternal Lord, all your lives are mine. The Soul Sect’s master too. Will you come out yourself, or shall I kill my way in?”

Liu Yuan spoke solemnly, “Yang Ye, can’t you give some consideration for the past?”

Yang Ye gazed at Liu Yuan, “Of course! You’ve helped me in the past, and I will never forget that. But kindness and enmity are two different things. I must kill them, especially the Soul Sect’s master. As for the Eternal Lord and the others, I can give you face and kill them in a month from now. If they fall in battle, I’ll let bygones be bygones; if they survive, I’ll send them off on their way.”

Liu Yuan’s expression was extremely unsightly.

Oppressive!

Yang Ye was being oppressive right now!

A moment of silence ensued, and then Liu Yuan gazed at him, “Yang Ye, I know you’re extremely strong, and none of us are a match for you in single combat. But we have countless experts here, and the formations from years ago. You won’t have any advantage in a head-on collision with us.”

The Soul Sect was part of the Eternal Kingdom right now. If she agreed to Yang Ye’s demands, wouldn’t it disappoint countless?

Yang Ye chuckled, “Liu Yuan, you should be thankful that it isn’t someone else who said that to me. Otherwise, I’d bury this War Dimension right now. But as I’ve mentioned earlier, I owe you, and I don’t want to repay that with evil!”

He summoned Snowy as he spoke.

Liu Yuan turned pale when she saw Snowy.

Yang Ye spoke coldly, “She could even eliminate all the End World’s formations with ease, so shall I ask her to undo all the formations you have here?”

The Good Sprite!

Liu Yuan closed her eyes slowly. She knew that the little fellow could get everyone here killed.

Because once the formations were gone, the desolate race’s army would attack, and everyone here would die. As for their formations, formations were useless before the little fellow!

The War Dimension had no right to negotiate with Yang Ye!

Suddenly, a black shadow appeared before Liu Yuan.

The Soul Sect’s master!

Liu Yuan was about to speak when he shook his head, “Liu Yuan, this is between us, so we’ll deal with it ourselves. You can go back inside.”

She gazed at Yang Ye, “Yang Ye, can you really not make an exception?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “I’m repaying you by not annihilating the entire Eternal Kingdom. Liu Yuan, you know how the Eternal Kingdom treated me and the Ancient Sword Sect. So, don’t ask me to make exceptions because they never did that for me and the Ancient Sword Sect.”

Liu Yuan fell silent for a moment and left.

She knew that nothing she said would change anything.

It was time for the Eternal Kingdom to pay for what it had done. Of course, she was thankful that she’d helped Yang Ye in the past. If it wasn’t for that, Yang Ye would probably not even waste his breath on her.

But she felt it was a terrible pity too. Because Yang Ye had once been part of the War Dimension!

Once she entered the city, the Soul Sect’s master gazed at Yang Ye and smiled, “Time changed, huh?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “Sorry, I’m not interested in wasting my breath on you.”

Yang Ye vanished on the spot.

The Soul Sect’s master’s eyes narrowed slightly, and he waved his right hand. The Super Divine Treasure, the Soul Awl, appeared before him, and it spun madly. In an instant, countless strands of Soul Energy rippled out from the awl.

At the same time, his entire body started to burn.

Soul Ignition!

He was very well aware that he had no chance. He’d been in the End World, so he knew how strong Yang Ye was.

Only Heng Wangu and the other old geezers stood a chance against Yang Ye in single combat!

So, he didn’t hold back from the beginning!

he didn’t hold back at all!

He planned to take Yang Ye down with him!

If he risked everything, he may be able to escape with his life; but if he didn’t, he would just be giving his life away!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye arrived before him.

Past Life!

The soul energy was instantly obliterated before Past Life!

Past Life was the bane of souls!

In an instant, the soul energy was obliterated, and the sword stabbed against the awl.

Crack!

The Soul Awl cracked open. Meanwhile, Yang Ye twisted his sword, and it stabbed at the Sword Sect’s master who was standing behind the Soul Awl.

The Soul Sect’s master revealed a ferocious grin on his face, and then his soul suddenly expanded!

Self-detonation!

Suddenly, Yang Ye stomped his right foot down and flashed by like a ray of light.

Hiss!

The ear piercing sound of something being sliced open resounded!

A moment later, Yang Ye was behind the Soul Sect’s master.

There was a brief moment of silence before the Soul Sect’s master turned ethereal and vanished.

An instant kill!

An absolutely instant kill without any chance to fight back!

Yang Ye put his sword away and walked over to the city, “Disciples of the Ancient Sword Sect, come to me!”
