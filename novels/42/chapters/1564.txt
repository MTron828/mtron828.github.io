Chapter 1565 - He’s Absolutely Vengeful!

Translator: InVader

The experts of the Divine Phoenix Clan weren’t the only ones. At this moment, all the Rebirth Realm experts here had extremely unsightly expressions on their faces.

If it was merely the Stellar Sword Diagram, then their joint forces would have no need to fear it. The reason they were afraid was the flames that covered the sword energy.

Especially Jiang Mo, he’d come into close contact with those flames, so he knew very well how terrifying they were.

He knew that if the sword energy descended, then Phoenix Domain would really vanish from this world. Phoenix Domain wouldn’t be the only thing that vanished, all the living beings in Phoenix Domain would vanish too.

As soon as he thought up to this point, Mo Jiang ignored everything else and hurriedly looked at Yang Ye. He shouted, “Yang Ye, my Divine Phoenix Clan is willing to let you leave. Quickly stop your sword energy!”

Yang Ye paid no attention to Mo Jiang. The stellar sword energy was descending faster and faster under his control. At this moment, the stellar sword energy was just around 100m above them.

“Retreat!” Suddenly, Su Dan immediately decided to retreat, and he vanished on the spot with the other human experts.

“Retreat!” It didn’t take long for the experts of the Heavenly Dragon Clan to vanish. The Heavenly Dragon Clan wasn’t the only clan that left, all the other Rebirth Realm experts besides the experts of the Divine Phoenix Clan had left.

Stop the sword energy from descending?

What a joke! Even if they weren’t surrounded by those flames, it wouldn’t be easy to stop them. Now that they were covered by those flames, they were even more difficult to stop. If they stayed behind and resisted the sword energy until the end, then they were certain that at least 90% of them would perish here. Moreover, they may not even be able to succeed in the end!

Suddenly, one of the experts from the Divine Phoenix Clan said, “Retreat! We must retreat!”

“Retreat?” Mo Jiang turned around and roared with fury, “What about the Phoenix Domain? What about the countless living beings here?”

The old man spoke in a low voice, “If we die, then no one will be left to avenge our clan.”

Mo Jiang had a ferocious expression on his face, and he was visibly struggling. He remained silent for a short while, and then he took a deep breath and howled with fury, “Retreat! Everyone leave Phoenix Domain! Save as many as you can.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he suddenly turned to look at Yang Ye, and he spoke fiercely, “Yang Ye, I’ll definitely make you pay a thousandfold for this!”

Once he finished speaking, he vanished on the spot with the other experts from the Divine Phoenix Clan. Meanwhile, the flames had descended completely. Everything throughout the Phoenix Domain was obliterated. At the same time, the waves of flames had spread throughout the Phoenix Domain, and the joint destruction caused by the waves of flames and the sword energy caused the space in the Phoenix Domain to start shattering.

Boom!

Around an hour later, a resounding explosion surged through Sky Sky Continent.

Along with that explosion, the Phoenix Domain was completely destroyed!

At this moment, everyone knew that the Divine Phoenix Clan would fall into a decline. Even though its Rebirth Realm experts had mostly been able to escape, at least 90% of the phoenixes below the Rebirth Realm had perished. If a power didn’t have new blood to maintain and grow its strength, it wouldn’t last for long, and it would have no future.

The news that the Divine Phoenix Clan had been almost annihilated swept swiftly through Sky Sky Continent. At this moment, all the powers throughout the continent heard of a name — Yang Ye!

Actually, many powers throughout the continent knew Yang Ye’s name even before this. After all, he’d killed his way up here from the lower dimensions. However, they merely knew Yang Ye’s name before this, and they were merely curious about him. They held no fear towards him. Yet now, many powers were fearful of Yang Ye. Because he possessed strength capable of almost annihilating the Divine Phoenix Clan on his own!

…

Oblivion Boundary City. The Goat Pub.

Ding Shaoyao heaved a sigh of relief when she found out what had happened in the Divine Phoenix Clan, and she’d finally relaxed for real. Actually, she didn’t want the Nether Pavilion to show itself. Why? Because if the members of the Nether Pavilion came, then those who were acting against the Nether Pavilion from the shadows would show themselves as well.

At that time, Yang Ye would truly be in danger.

After all, a force that could force the Nether Pavilion to leave to the lower dimensions was absolutely not something Yang Ye could fight right now. Fortunately, he’d been able to deal with it on his own!

She remained silent in the room for a long time, and then she suddenly spoke, “Tell our forces to do everything they can to enter the Human Alliance.”

“Yes!” A voice came from outside her door.

Ding Shaoyao clenched her fists slowly, “Who is scheming against Yang Ye and the Nether Pavilion?”

…

On that unknown mountain range. In the bamboo house.

The woman was seated on a bamboo bed and playing Go. She was all alone. She raised a black piece and placed it down on the board, and then an almost imperceptible smile curled up on the corners of her mouth, “Interesting. An unknown flame? Haha. You have quite a few trump cards.”

As soon as she finished speaking, she suddenly looked towards a corner of the house and smiled, “Are you very happy? Actually, I’m very happy as well. Because this world will cease to be peaceful with his presence here.”

As soon as she finished speaking, she returned her attention to the Go board, and it didn’t take long for the house to only be filled with the sound of Go pieces being placed down.

…

After he destroyed the Phoenix Domain, Yang Ye didn’t leave the place, nor was he able to. Because those experts were searching all over for him.

In a hole deep beneath the ground, Yang Ye entered the Primordial Pagoda.

As soon as he entered the Primordial Pagoda, Yang Ye’s face warped severely. At this moment, his entire body was blood red. But while it seemed like it was blood, if one looked carefully, one would notice that it was actually fine strands of flames. Presently, these fine strands of flames were violently burning his body.

Yang Ye howled, “Yin! Quickly take these flames back!”

However, the Divine Yin Flame didn’t answer him.

Meanwhile, Little Sky appeared in front of Yang Ye, “It seems to have fallen into deep sleep.”

Yang Ye asked, “What? What do you mean?”

Little Sky shook her head, “Its main body can’t leave this place, and it could only send out its energy through you. However, you aren’t able to endure its strength at all. Moreover, it had forcefully sent its energy out from this place, so it struck quite a huge blow on itself.”

Yang Ye’s face was severely warped, “Then what should I do?”

At this moment, the remaining flames from the Divine Yin Flame were still on him. Even though the flames weren’t trying to incinerate him, the temperature that the flames gave off was ceaselessly burning his body. If he didn’t have the energy of the Demon God and the Primordial Violet Energy, he would have been burned to ash by now.

Little Sky shrugged, “I too don’t know what you should do.”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

Little Sky shook her head, “You seem like you’re in a huge amount of pain. I… I… But that doesn’t have anything to do with me.”

Yang Ye spoke angrily, “Little Sky! Are you looking for a beating?!”

Little Sky chuckled, “I was joking. However, I really can’t help you. Because those flames have merged into one with your body. If you want to get rid of them, the only way is to rely on yourself and slowly force them out of yourself.”

Yang Ye had no other choice but to remove the flames on his own.

Needless to say, the flames were really terrifying. Fortunately, they were trying to incinerate him on purpose. Otherwise, his body wouldn’t be able to endure them. Even then, the temperature they gave off was sufficient to fill his entire body with extreme pain, and it was even worse than the pain he suffered from the backlash of his sword intent.

Yang Ye gradually pushed out the flames with the help of his Primordial Violet Energy, and they swiftly returned to the pill furnace once they left his body.

Around two hours later, Yang Ye’s body had returned to normal.

Little Sky asked, “What do you plan to do now?”

“What do I plan to do?” A ferocious smile curled up on the corners of Yang Ye’s mouth, “Annihilate the Divine Phoenix Clan, of course!” Even though he’d destroyed Phoenix Domain, many phoenixes had fled the Phoenix Domain before its destruction.

Little Sky spoke softly, “You’ve killed a lot already.”

“No, it’s not a lot at all!” Yang Ye shook his head, “I’m going to cut off the head of every single phoenix in this world! I’m going to make them go extinct!”

As soon as he finished speaking, his figure vanished on the spot.

Little Sky remained silent for a long time, and then she sighed softly, “Why did they have to offend that fellow? Can’t everyone just live in peace? All of you just have to fight and kill each other… Greed is a sin!”

…

Demon God Mountain.

After the Phoenix Domain was destroyed, the lucky survivors of the Divine Phoenix Clan temporarily moved to Demon God Mountain. At this moment, less than 3,000 phoenixes remained from the Divine Phoenix Clan. Moreover, it was only because many phoenixes weren’t even in the Phoenix Domain, and very few had actually fled successfully from the Phoenix Domain. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Needless to say, the Divine Phoenix Clan was in a very miserable state right now!

…

Demon God’s Palace.

At this moment, there were over 40 Rebirth Realm experts here, and they were the patriarchs of the various clans in the Demon Territory.

The Heavenly Dragon Clan’s Gu Tian gazed at Mo Jiang and asked, “Why is Yang Ye attacking the Divine Phoenix Clan?”

The others gazed at Mo Jiang as well.

After all, there was definitely a reason why Yang Ye was attacking the Divine Phoenix Clan like a madman, and they were really curious about the reason.

Mo Jiang remained silent.

Gu Tian spoke indifferently, “Mo Jiang, only by knowing the cause of this will we be able to think of a way to draw Yang Ye out. If you intend to continue keeping it a secret, then we won’t be able to help you.”

Mo Jiang remained silent for a long time before he said, “We captured two of his friends.”

The others exchanged glances, and Gu Mo frowned.

Mo Jiang added, “It’s pointless to speak about all of that right now, right? The Nether Pavilion and Yang Ye aren’t just targeting my Divine Phoenix Clan now, they’re targeting our entire demon race!”

Gu Mo asked abruptly, “Where are his friends?”

Mo Jiang shook his head, “We extracted the consciousness of one of them. But Xiaoleng stole it. I don’t know where Xiaoleng is right now. As for the other one, that friend of his was in my clan’s possession, but she suddenly vanished mysteriously.”

“You brought all of this upon yourself!” Gu Mo shook his head, and then he flicked a scroll to each and every one of the people here, “This is the information about Yang Ye that we collected from the lower dimensions. He’s an absolutely vengeful person, so this matter won’t end just like that.”

Mo Jiang spoke ferociously, “Are you telling me our demon race is afraid of him?!”

Gu Mo shook his head, and then a bitter smile curled up on the corners of his mouth, “If he doesn’t show himself and focuses on cultivating. Then it’ll only take ten years… No! Just five years are enough. Five years later, he’ll be invincible like the Unfettered One was all those years ago. At that time, which one of you will be able to stop him? Can any one of you do anything?”

All of them revealed quite unsightly expressions on their faces.

Yang Ye was already so formidable right now, so how fearsome would he be in five years?
