Chapter 1891 – Did the Chicken or the Egg Come First?

Book 16 — Hunted

I, Yang Ye, am here!

Tremble before me!

Needless to say, Yang Ye wasn’t keeping a low profile at all. However, it was exactly what he wanted. Because he was very well aware that he was bound to be unable to keep a low profile upon arriving in the large universe.

Since he couldn’t do that, he intended to make a show of strength!

After Yang Ye instantly annihilated the yellow robed man, he gazed at the others, causing their expressions to change drastically.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye spoke coldly, “Fuck off and tell the Sovereign of Man to clean his throat! I’ll come get his head soon!”

The expressions of everyone here was quite off when they heard this.

The Sovereign of Man!

He was one of the leaders of the human race. Even in the large universe that was filled with experts, he was still someone who was ranked at the top. But Yang Ye wanted him to clean his throat and get ready to be killed.

Arrogant!

Absolutely arrogant!

Those experts had extremely unsightly expressions on their faces when Yang Ye gazed at them. All of them were at the Enlightened Realm. Needless to say, they wanted to attack him, but they didn’t dare to. Because the yellow robed man Yang Ye just killed was stronger than all of them.

But Yang Ye had killed the yellow robed man with a single attack!

Just one attack!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly roared with fury, “Are you still not going to fuck off?”

They glanced at him, and then the man who led the group now suddenly said, “Yang Ye, this is betrayal of the human race. You…”

Yang Ye suddenly laughed with ridicule, “So refusing to let the Sovereign of Man kill me is betrayal of the human race?”

That fellow intended to say more, but Yang Ye suddenly said, “Say another word and all four of you can stay here forever!”

That man stared at Yang Ye and said, “Let's see how long you can stay so arrogant!”

He turned around with the intent to leave, but a ray of light flashed below Yang Ye’s feet. An instant later, a wave of mysterious energy appeared here.

The Sword Domain!

Everyone’s expressions changed when the Sword Domain enveloped them. At the same time, a ray of light flashed.

Split Second!

The man’s figure stiffened on the spot, and then a hole suddenly split open on his forehead. An instant later, blood sprayed out like a fountain, and the man’s face was covered in blood.

The atmosphere here instantly became heavy.

Yang Ye had killed because of the slightest disagreement!

Gu Ya and the others’ gazes had a trace of fear when they gazed at Yang Ye again.

The remaining experts who were sent by the Sovereign of Man didn’t dare to say another word, and they immediately turned around and left. Or to be more precise, they fled.

Yang Ye’s expression remained calm when he saw them flee, but he heaved a sigh of relief in his heart. Even though he looked very powerful, he wouldn’t be able to deal with them if they ganged up on him.

After all, he wasn’t at the Enlightened Realm!

Moreover, he hadn’t forgotten the people around him. Even though Gu Ya and the others were from the medium universe, their strength was much greater than Enlightened Realm experts.

Once he was too exhausted, he couldn’t guarantee that they wouldn’t attack him. Especially Qian Xie!

Meanwhile, Gu Ya suddenly said, “Everyone, even though we’re in the large universe now, we aren’t truly safe.”

All of them gazed at Gu Ya.

Gu Ya said, “This place is called the Barrier’s Entrance, and it’s an extremely remote place in the large universe. We’ll only truly be within the large universe once we leave this place. At that time, we’ll be truly safe. However, if I’m not wrong, the experts of those large organizations are waiting for us at the exit!”

Suddenly, Qian Xie said, “I understand what you mean. You hope that we join forces, right?”

Gu Ya nodded, “Trust me, we’re not a match for them on our own!”

Qian Xie chuckled, “Of course we can. But I have a suggestion. Yang Ye can’t come with us!”

Everyone gazed at Qian Xie.

Yang Ye glanced at Qian Xie and didn’t say a word.

Meanwhile, Qian Xie said, ‘Everyone, I’m sure you’re aware who Yang Ye has offended. The Sovereign of Man. Moreover, I’m sure all of you are aware that he hasn’t just cultivated a devil cultivation technique, he has even cultivated the techniques of the human race’s enemy, the shaman race. If we stay with him, we’ll definitely suffer all sorts of trouble, and we may even become the enemies of the entire human race because of him.”

All of them fell silent when they heard Qian Xie.

Even though they didn’t know why Qian Xie kept targeting Yang Ye, they knew he was right.

Yang Ye was strong, but he was too skilled at causing trouble. If he stayed with them, his problems might become their problems. Especially the Sovereign of Man, the Sovereign of Man would definitely not spare Yang Ye. At that time, if they were with Yang Ye, they couldn’t guarantee that the Sovereign of Man’s rage wouldn’t extend to them too!

So, as soon as they thought up to this point, they had a decision.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly stepped forward and smiled, “I understand. Good luck!”

He turned around and intended to leave once he finished speaking.

Suddenly, Gu Ya flicked a scroll over to Yang Ye, “It’s the map of this place. Even though it isn’t very complete, it should be helpful to you.”

Yang Ye didn’t refuse. He took it and said, “Thank you!”

He vanished into the distance once he finished speaking.

Qian Xie watched Yang Ye leave with a cold smile on his face. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Suddenly, the woman in a red dress from Moment Mountain walked off towards the distance.

Everyone gazed at her.

Gu Ya suddenly asked, “You’re leaving?”

She stopped, glanced at them, and said, “So what if we’re devil cultivators or evil cultivators?”

Her figure turned ethereal, and then she was over 10,000km away.

Suddenly, a voice resounded, “She’s an evil cultivator!”

All of them immediately came to an understanding.

Gu Ya withdrew his thoughts, “Let’s go!” He immediately vanished on the spot once he finished speaking.

Around 15 minutes after they left, the ground suddenly trembled, and then a figure floated out from there.

“Their quality is quite good! Hehe…” The shadow vanished without making another sound.

…

Meanwhile, Yang Ye withdrew the map, glanced at it, and then put it away after he found the exit. After that, he vanished into the distance.

The exit!

Just like Gu Ya and the others, he had to leave this place as soon as possible. Otherwise, it was easy for him to be caught!

It was around half a day’s journey.

Based on his current speed, it would take him half a day to get to the exit. Of course, it would take that long only if nothing unexpected occurred.

An hour later, Yang Ye suddenly stopped. He glanced at the surroundings before tapping two fingers forward.

A ray of light flashed.

Bang!

A point in space around 3km away trembled, and then an old man walked out from there.

The old man sized up Yang Ye and smiled, “Interesting!”

Yang Ye glanced at the old man and spoke indifferently, “Do you need something?”

The old man smiled, “Your natural talent isn’t bad. I want to take you as my disciple.”

He paused for a moment and added, “I forgot to tell you that I’m Gu Qiantang, an elder of the Immortal Wing Sect!”

“The Immortal Wing Sect?” Yang Ye frowned slightly, “Never heard of it!”

The old man wasn’t angered by this and said, “The human race has ten paradises. The Immortal Wing Sect is located on Immortal Wing Mountain, and it’s one of those paradises. Young man, joining one of the ten paradises is a dream that countless youths have.”

One of the ten paradises!

Yang Ye thought for a moment and replied, “What sort of existence is the Sovereign of Man in the human race?”

“The Sovereign of Man?” The old man was slightly stunned, and then he said, “The Sovereign of Man is the holy monarch who manages the human world, and the ten paradises belong to the human world.”

Yang Ye asked, “Do the ten paradises obey the Sovereign of Man’s orders?”

The old man thought for a moment and said, “It depends on the situation. Normally, the ten paradises don’t obey the Sovereign of Man’s orders. However, if we enter into battle with the shaman race, then the Sovereign of Man has the authority to gather all the powers and go to battle.”

Yang Ye suddenly asked, “What happens if you don’t obey his orders?”

The old man said, “How can we not? If we disobey his orders, the human race would be in danger. Alright, you’ll find out about the large universe once you go back to the sect with me.”

Yang Ye glanced at the old man and said, “I heard that once all of you take the people of the lower universes back with you, you erase their memories and take control of them. Right?”

A wisp of surprise flashed through the old man’s eyes, “You know quite a bit!”

Yang Ye asked, “Is it true?”

The old man explained, “That was in the past. Now, besides a few evil sects and devil sects, very few powers do that!”

Yang Ye asked, “Why?”

“Potential problems!” The old man continued, “As those people gradually grew stronger, their memories recovered. Once they fully recovered their memories, it would be a problem. So, everyone changed our ways of doing things. We rope people over to our side now!”

Yang Ye nodded slightly. He thought for a moment and said, “Senior, I appreciate your kindness. However, out of consideration for you and your sect, I think that it’s best that I don’t join!”

The old man was puzzled, “Why?”

Yang Ye replied, “I’m afraid you might cry when the time comes!”

The old man felt speechless.

Yang Ye didn’t say another word. He just turned around and walked away.

Suddenly, the old man appeared in front of Yang Ye. He looked Yang Ye in the eyes and asked, “You refuse?”

Yang Ye nodded.

The old man spoke indifferently, “You looked not bad, so I wanted to take you as my disciple. But now it seems like you’re really not sensible. Since that’s the case, I don’t mind using a different method.”

Yang Ye asked, “Capture me? And then erase my memories?”

The old man replied, “You chose this path!”

Suddenly, a ray of light flashed beneath Yang Ye’s feet, and then a wave of mysterious energy appeared here.

The old man’s expression changed drastically, and he was about to leave.

However, a sword pressed against his forehead.

Yang Ye looked the old man in the eyes and said, “Answer a question of mine and I’ll spare your life if your answer satisfied me!”

The old man stared at Yang Ye while disbelief filled his eyes.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye pressed the sword a little harder against the old man’s forehead and said, “Tell me, did the chicken or the egg come first?”
