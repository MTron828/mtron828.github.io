Chapter 1320 – Killing Voiders Like Dogs!

Quasi Returnal Rank sword intent at the brink!

Yang Ye was very well aware that bringing his Quasi Returnal Rank sword intent to the brink would speed up the backlash, but he had no other choice right now. He could only choose such an extreme method. Otherwise, if he were to let it drag on, then his enemies would have no need to even attack him. He himself would be crippled by the backlash from his sword intent!

At the moment his sword intent started to condense, Nie Hun and the others’ expressions changed drastically. They didn’t know what Yang Ye was doing, but they had no doubt that it was very dangerous, extremely dangerous! Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“Retreat!” Nie Hun didn’t hesitate to retreat with Nie Tian and the others.

Bang!

Suddenly, a terrifying force swept towards them from Yang Ye. As soon as the force appeared, the auras emanated by Nie Hun and the others were immediately obliterated. Moreover, 2 Voiders who hadn’t been able to retreat in time were instantly obliterated into bits. At the same time, the space in an area of numerous kilometers around Yang Ye rumbled and collapsed.

But that wasn’t the end of it!

Crack! Crack!

The space in an area of around 30m suddenly started to crack apart. Countless arm-thick cracks stretched out incessantly through space. In just an instant, the space in the area had cracked apart like a spiderweb.

As for Nie Hun and the others, they’d been blasted almost 10km away. Because space had collapsed, all of them were within a black hole right now. However, the swallowing force of a black hole was of no threat to experts at their level.

Nie Hun spoke solemnly, “Repair the space around us!”

As soon he gave the order, all of them acted in unison. 9 Voiders acted simultaneously and instantly repaired the space around them. However, Nie Hun’s expression suddenly changed drastically, “Watch out!”

As soon as he finished speaking, a ray of blood red light appeared within their fields of vision. It was extremely swift. It was so swift that it was practically impossible to detect.

Nie Tian and the others’ hairs stood on end. They were just about to react when the body of one of the Voiders suddenly stiffened. A fine blood red hole had appeared between his brows. At this moment, blood was spraying out of it like a fountain. An instant later, the corpse vanished on the spot.

At the same time, a blood red ray of light appeared once more.

“Don’t you dare!” Nie Hun was furious. He waved both his hands and the space in around 10km instantly trembled, and then everything seemed to stop. At this moment, Nie Tian and the others noticed that Yang Ye was already in front of one of their companions. Yang Ye’s sword was just a few inches away from that Voider of the Nie Clan!

That Voider’s face instantly turned ghastly pale from fright when he noticed that Yang Ye’s sword was just a few inches away from him. If it wasn’t for Nie Hun, he might not have even been able to react before Yang Ye killed him. But right when he heaved a sigh of relief, a mysterious force suddenly appeared here.

After that, Yang Ye’s figure moved.

Hiss!

The blood red ray of light shot straight into that Voider’s forehead, and then his eyes opened wide while disbelief filled them. It didn’t take long for the color in his eyes to gradually fade, and then his corpse vanished on the spot.

“Yang Ye!” Nie Hun’s face was covered in ferocity. He’d thought that the Laws of Time would be able to save that Voider, but his laws of Time had been instantly suppressed by Yang Ye’s Sword Domain. This time, he understood how terrifying a Domain was. The Laws couldn’t resist a Domain at all! At the very least, the Laws of Time couldn’t!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye’s face started to warp after he instantly killed that Voider. Nie Tian and the others were delighted by the sight of this, and Nie Tian said, “Everyone join forces and wait for him to suffer from the backlash of his sword intent!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Nie Tian and the others swiftly converged with Nie Hun. At the same time, the 7 Voiders released their auras once more. This time, they didn’t use their auras to attack Yang Ye, and they just formed an invisible barrier that protected them.

It wasn’t that they didn’t want to attack Yang Ye, they just didn’t dare to. Yang Ye’s speed was horrifying by itself. Besides Nie Hun, anyone who attacked would definitely be the 1st to die. Thinking about Yang Ye’s speed filled Nie Tian with regret. Why did Yang Ye possess such speed? It was all his fault!

If he hadn’t given that precious treasure of the Nie Clan’s, Blink, to Yang Ye, even if Yang Ye had improved his sword intent, it was impossible for Yang Ye to be this terrifying. But he just happened to have done exactly that.... It could be said that the reason Yang Ye was so terrifying was partially his contribution.

Nie Tian wasn’t the only one to feel regret, Senior Yuan felt the same way. If he knew Yang Ye’s strength was so abnormal, he would have absolutely not become enemies with Yang Ye just for a single Voider and young master of the Yuan Clan. The consequences of becoming enemies with Yang Ye was that he was the last remaining Voider of the Yuan Clan. In short, the Yuan Clan was finished.

It would take a few hundred or even over a thousand years to rebuild the Yuan Clan. Because just a single Voider wasn’t something that could be fostered in a short period of time!

In short, the Yuan Clan was finished.

Senior Yuan took a deep breath, and the killing intent in his eyes as he gazed at Yang Ye was almost material. Now, all he wanted was vengeance.

Nie Hun and the others didn’t attack. All of them ready for combat. In their opinion, Yang Ye was on the verge of exhaustion. So long as Yang Ye suffered from the backlash of improving his sword intent, then killing Yang Ye would be absolutely easy!

Yang Ye’s eyes were closed while his brows were pressed together tightly, and his face had started to warp. At the same time, the Returnal Rank sword intent around him started to become violent and chaotic.

Nie Tian and the others were delighted at the sight of it. Because they knew that Yang Ye had started to suffer backlash from his sword intent.

Nie Hun spoke in a low voice, “Get ready!”

The others nodded. The profound energy within them started to surge, and they were ready to attack at any moment.

Around 3 breaths of time later, Yang Ye suddenly groaned softly with pain, and then the blood red sword in his grasp fell down from midair.

Nie Tian and the others were delighted by the sight of this, and a slight smile curled up on the corners of Nie Hun’s mouth. He waved his right hand and said, “Attack!”

The others hurriedly retracted their auras, and then charged at Yang Ye. Suddenly, Yang Ye opened his eyes, and a red glow flashed through them. At the same time, his hand moved slightly, and the falling blood red sword suddenly flew back into his grasp. A moment later, Yang Ye was gone from where he stood.

“Watch out! He hasn’t suffered from backlash yet!” Nie Hun was shocked. He clenched his right fist and slammed it in Yang Ye’s direction.

Bang!

The spot Yang Ye had been standing on collapsed in an instant, but Yang Ye wasn’t there anymore. A shrill cry resounded over 100m away. Nie Hun looked over, and then ferocity filled his eyes. Because Yang Ye was behind a Voider of the Nie Clan. As for that Voider, he was dead, of course!

Yang Ye waved his right hand and took the corpse. A moment later, he stomped his right foot down, and then a ray of blood red light flashed. Yang Ye’s figure transformed into a blood red ray of light that vanished on the spot. At the moment he vanished, the others were instantly horrified because Yang Ye was absolutely capable of killing anyone he wanted!

Just like before, nothing unexpected occurred. At the moment the ray of light appeared, another Voider from the Nie Clan stiffened on the spot, and there was a very striking blood red hole on his forehead.

Another Voider had perished!

Only 5 Voiders from the Nie Clan remained. In other words, 7 had fallen to Yang Ye.

7 Voiders, not Emperors!

Nie Hun and Nie Tian’s hearts were bleeding.

“Second Uncle, we have to retreat!” Nie Tian spoke solemnly, “If the experts of our clan continue dying like this, it’ll spoil our ancestor’s plan.”

“Retreat?” Nie Hun glanced coldly at Nie Tian and said, “So, all of them died for nothing? Besides that, if we retreat today, the Nie Clan will become the laughingstock of both the human race and demon race. Moreover, if he’s allowed to leave today, then once he recovers or attains the Emperor Realm, even our Nie Clan would be helpless before him!”

Nie Tian still wanted to say something, but he swallowed his words when he noticed that Nie Hun’s eyes were filled with madness.

Actually, he didn’t want to leave as well. If they left now, the Nie Clan would be utterly humiliated. Moreover, its prestige and influence would decline tremendously. However, if they didn’t leave, then Yang Ye.... In short, if he knew that Yang Ye was such a madman, he would have definitely not agreed to let Senior Yuan’s group kill the experts of the Slayer Pavilion!

Even if the Nie Clan could kill Yang Ye, it suffered a huge loss!

Suddenly, one of the Voiders suddenly spoke, “Look at him!”

All of them looked at Yang Ye when they heard this. They saw Yang Ye was covered in sweat and his face had warped. Moreover, his entire body was trembling violently. At the same time, they sensed that the sword intent around Yang Ye was actually weakening slowly!

“He’s suffering from backlash!” Nie Hun and the others were delighted, and there was joy and excitement in their eyes. After waiting for so long and losing so many, they’d finally waited until Yang Ye suffered from backlash. So, how could they not feel excited and happy?

Nie Tian asked, “Should we attack?”

Nie Hun shook his head, “Let’s wait a while!”

Nie Tian nodded. Actually, he was quite afraid that Yang Ye was acting. He wasn’t the only one; the other Voiders of the Nie Clan were of the same mind.

Nie Hun and the others stared fixedly at Yang Ye.

Yang Ye’s body started trembling even more violently while the sword intent around him grew weaker and weaker. Obviously, he was suffering from backlash, but Nie Hun and the others still didn’t dare to attack. They were really quite afraid of him, and even Nie Hun feared Yang Ye.

Time passed by slowly. At this moment, the sword intent around Yang Ye had returned to normal.

Nie Hun ordered decisively, “Attack!”

Suddenly, Yang Ye opened his eyes. Nie Tian and the others’ eyelids immediately twitched at the sight of this, and they stopped on the spot.

“Attack! He can’t hold on anymore!” As soon as Nie Hun finished speaking, he took the lead and charged at Yang Ye.

Nie Tian and the others stopped hesitating, and they charged at Yang Ye as well.

Yang Ye closed his eyes slowly. At this moment, all he wanted was to sleep.

Suddenly, a ray of violet light flashed, and then Zi’er appeared before him. She didn’t speak and laid down gently in his arms before hugging him tightly.

Yang Ye opened his eyes slightly. He glanced at the Voiders who were charging at him, and then he glanced at Zi’er!

Zi’er!

Zi’er!

Zi’er!

Yang Ye suddenly bit the tip of his tongue, and the sharp pain caused his heavy mind to instantly clear up tremendously. He held tightly to Zi’er with his left hand while he stretched out his right hand, “IGNITE!”
