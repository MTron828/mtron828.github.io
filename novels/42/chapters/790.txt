Suddenly, a strand of sword intent seeped out from within Yang Ye.

The old man shook his head slightly and was about to speak. Suddenly, his expression changed drastically, and he instantly dispersed his technique. Meanwhile, his hair had instantly turned from black to snow white. Moreover, there were even many times more wrinkles on his face. He seemed like he’d instantly aged 100 years!

“What sword intent is that?” The old man’s eyes had shock in them.

“Decay Sword Intent!” Yang Ye walked over to the old man and stretched out his hand, “You’ve lost!” 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Is that the might of the Laws?” asked the old man.

Yang Ye nodded in response.

The old man gazed at Yang Ye for a short while, and then he shook his head and laughed bitterly, “I never expected that you’d actually comprehended the energy of the Laws, and it’s even such a powerful Law. I’ve really lost this time. I didn’t have much lifespan left, and now I have very little left. This is my fate!”

As he spoke, he passed the Saint Spirit Fruit to Yang Ye and said, “Go on. It’s best if you don’t stay in the city. While there aren’t many here who can kill you, there aren’t a few either!”

As soon as he finished speaking, the old man went back to his sling chair and laid down on it.

“Senior, are you from Profounder Continent?” asked Yang Ye.

“Yes!” The old man continued, “I know what you’re wondering. The reason I’m letting you go is because you’re from Profounder Continent, and you’re protecting it. I can’t step forward and help Profounder Continent, and this is all I can do. Good luck on the rest!”

The old man closed his eyes once he finished speaking.

Yang Ye bowed slightly to the old man, and then he turned around and left the pavilion.

“Profounder Continent....” The old man opened his eyes once more when Yang Ye left, and there were ripples in his eyes as he seemed to be recollecting events of the past.

After he left the Technique Pavilion, Yang Ye immediately hid himself and traveled to the entrance of the city. At this moment, the area there was truly covered in corpses and flooded with blood. Moreover, countless severed limbs covered the ground while the buildings in the vicinity had been blasted into bits. It was a complete mess.

Both sides weren’t fighting anymore, and they were just standing in confrontation.

Even though the defiant profounders had lost some forces, even more defiant profounders had entered the city. So, there were over 4,000 defiant profounders here right now, whereas the Hallowed Grounds had even more forces. It had over 10,000 experts on its side while more Half-Saints were rushing over from all directions from time to time.

Yang Ye’s brows knit tightly together as he stood in the shadows. Why have they stopped fighting?

Suddenly, he raised his head and looked up into the sky. He sensed 2 extremely powerful auras in the distant sky, and their auras were even stronger than Elder Mu and Lu Yan!

They are negotiating? Yang Ye’s heart sank. Even though there was deep rooted enmity between the defiant profounders and the Hallowed Grounds, they had a similar objective as well. It was to break open the Heavenpath and charge into the Outer Heavens. Under such circumstances, it was absolutely possible for them to join forces. Moreover, once that happens, then it would undoubtedly be a calamity for Profounder Continent!

“Everyone, move out of the city!” Suddenly, a voice resounded from high above in the sky.

Yang Ye’s heart instantly sank to rock bottom when he heard this. Obviously, they’d come to an agreement!

While the defiant profounders were unwilling, they didn’t dare disobey an order from that person who spoke, so they immediately retreated from the city!

Meanwhile, another voice resounded in the sky, “Kill Yang Ye and reclaim the Stone of Suppression! Don’t let others laugh at our Hallowed Grounds!”

Supreme Exalt He and Supreme Exalt Mu’s hearts shook, and they hurriedly nodded.

After the defiant profounders left, the experts of the Hallowed Grounds left as well. Meanwhile, Supreme Exalt He and Mu led over 100 Half-Saints to search madly for Yang Ye throughout the city.

No one noticed that almost half of the intact corpses around the entrance to the city had vanished.

After he left the Ancient City of Hallows, Yang Ye traveled swiftly all the way until the reached a mountain range that was a few thousand kilometers away from the city.

Yang Ye sat cross-legged on a huge rock while his face was covered in happiness and excitement. Because he’d obtained a total of almost 1,000 Half-Saint corpses this time!

1,000 corpses were equivalent to 1,000 Half-Saint Sword Servants!

How could he not be excited and happy?

But it didn’t take long for him to calm down. Because he’d thought of one thing, and it was that the defiant profounders and the Hallowed Grounds might have come to an agreement. Otherwise, it was impossible for them to stop fighting. If that was true, then it meant that Profounder Continent was in danger, huge danger!

1,000 Half-Saint Sword Servants were nothing to the defiant profounders and the Hallowed Grounds, unless all of them were mid-grade Half-Saints!

Brilliant light surged in Yang Ye’s eyes when he thought up to this point. If it was any other person, it would naturally be impossible to make 1,000 Half-Saint puppets advance to the mid-grade Half-Saint Realm, but he could! Because he had Primordial Violet Energy!

Yang Ye summoned the Sword Spirit and said, “I’ll leave those corpses to you. I have to improve my strength first!” As he spoke, he withdrew the Saint Spirit Fruit and said, “I hope its effects aren’t too bad!”

The Sword Spirit gestured slightly with her hand, and the fruit instantly flew into her grasp. She gazed at it for a short while before she passed it back to Yang Ye, “There’s nothing wrong with it. However, it isn’t realistic for you to rely on it to advance into the Half-Saint Realm. You have to rely on your own comprehension and fortune to advance into the Half-Saint Realm. Relying on external forces to advance by force is very difficult and very bad for you!”

Yang Ye said, “I never hoped that it could advance my cultivation to the Half-Saint Realm. I’ll be satisfied if it can just help me rise a single rank!” He had very little Primordial Violet Energy within him right now, and it was utterly insufficient for those 1,000 Sword Servants to attain the mid-grade Half-Saint Realm. So, he had to place his hopes on advancing in his cultivation. Because he would obtain a huge amount of Primordial Violet Energy with every rank he gained!

The Sword Spirit said, “I’m able to sense that the aura of life within the Hallowed Grounds is growing lesser and lesser. It’ll take half a month at most for everyone besides those within the Ancient City of Hallows to be exterminated. At that time, it’ll be a moment of life and death for Profounder Continent.”

Yang Ye asked, “What are you trying to say?”

The Sword Spirit answered, “You possess Quintessence Violet Energy. Even though you aren’t a Half-Saint, but you’re stronger than Half-Saints. So long as you give up on those people on Profounder Continent, then you’ll have an opportunity to escape this world once the defiant profounders and Hallowed Grounds utilizes the blood, resentment, and baleful energy of those people to break open the Heavenpath. I know that you won’t abandon your wives. However, you can place them within the Primordial Pagoda. In that way, not only can all of you live, you wouldn’t have to face the Outer Heavens’ forces. Isn’t that a win-win situation?”

Yang Ye gazed at her for a short while, and then he said, “I’m no savior, and I’ve never thought about being one. I don’t feel anything even if so many have died at the Hallowed Grounds. The defiant profounders can kill the members of the Hallowed Grounds, and I can watch as they slaughter them. However, they can’t kill the people on Profounder Continent!”

“Why?” asked the Sword Spirit in a low voice.

Yang Ye said, “A long time ago, I told them that if they followed me, then I wouldn’t abandon them no matter what. The Demon Emperor, the Founding Emperor, the Sword Sect, the Ding Clan.... They didn’t betray me when I was in my weakest state and suffered the most difficulties. So, how can I abandon them in the face of danger? If I do, then they would die! I can treat the lives of some as worthless grass, but the lives of some are worthy of me using my own life to protect! Even if we will lose in the end or even die, I won’t regret my decision!”

When he spoke up to this point, his voice sounded slightly heavier, “A man should feel no shame before the gods, the world, and himself! Those who bully and humiliate me will suffer 10 times the retribution, and those who help me will gain 10 times the repayment!”

“Alright! Alright! You’re really manly and very great. Let me see how you fight the Hallowed Grounds and the defiant profounders!” She glared fiercely at Yang Ye, and then she started to refine the Sword Servants.

Yang Ye shook his head, and then he seemed to have thought of something and said, “Sword Spirit, I met your past master!”

Her expression instantly changed. It became gloomy and ruthless, and there was even surging killing intent in her eyes.

Yang Ye sighed lightly and said, “He asked me to tell you something. He said that he wronged you all those years ago, and....”

“Shut up!” She suddenly pointed her finger at him. A ray of light smashed against Yang Ye’s chest, and it blasted him flying.

Bang!

He flew for almost 1km before he collided with a small hill, and then he crashed to the ground!

“You....” Yang Ye had just stood up when she appeared in front of him. At the same time, there was a sword placed against his throat.

“Where is he?” She stared fixedly at him with an emotionless gaze, and her voice was icy cold like 10,000 year old ice.

“He’s dead!” Yang Ye said, “Completely gone!”

“He’s dead?” She was slightly stunned, and then she roared madly with laughter as if she’d gone mad.

Yang Ye sighed softly. The more she acted like this, the more he realized that their relationship was definitely extremely good all those years ago. Unfortunately, he’d sacrificed her for this world, and that was why the Sword Spirit had such resentment and hatred for him.

She’s a very pitiable sword....

Yang Ye said, “I know that you definitely refuse to have another master, and I don’t want to be that master as well. You can leave whenever you want. Of course, it’s best if you stay behind because I really do need your help!”

“If you can save profounder continent by sacrificing me now, then what would you do!?” She suddenly stared him in the eyes.

Yang Ye shook his head and spoke without the slightest hesitation, “I wouldn’t sacrifice you! I’ll use my own way to save the continent and not rely on the sacrifice of someone to accomplish something. Of course, if I have to sacrifice the members of the Hallowed Grounds, then I wouldn’t hesitate at all!”

She laughed coldly and her face was covered in doubt.

Yang Ye shrugged and said, “It doesn’t matter whether you believe me or not!”

“Remember that we’re only working together, and I’ll get rid of you once we’re done!” She glanced coldly at Yang Ye, and then she turned around and started refining the Sword Servants.

She’s clearly a sword, but why does she seem like a real woman? Yang Ye shook his head and stopped lingering on this question. He swallowed the Saint Spirit Fruit, and then a strand of extremely powerful spirit energy instantly appeared within him. After that, Yang Ye’s eyes instantly opened wide! Because... his cultivation had actually advanced immediately!
