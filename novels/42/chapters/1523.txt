Chapter 1524 - Shamelessness Is The Way!

Translator: InVader

Just like before, Yang Ye immediately executed the Rebirth Sword thrice, and then he turned around and entered the door behind him.

He didn’t even turn back to see what happened!

The black robed old man’s face was terrifyingly gloomy!

He remained silent for an instant, and then he roared with fury and slammed his palm forward.

Bang!

The space in a huge area started rippling like boiling water.

He felt aggrieved!

The old man felt extremely aggrieved!

Suffering some injuries wasn’t a big deal. The main problem he had was that he felt humiliated. A Semi-Deity was actually making a fool out of a dignified Rebirth Realm expert like him!

As far as he was concerned, Yang Ye was making a fool out of him!

If news of this were to spread, he would definitely be unable to hold his head up high before other Rebirth Realm experts!

The old man was constantly filled with the impulse to charge down there and look for Yang Ye. However, when he thought of the Nether Pavilion, he immediately discarded such thoughts. Once he went down there and had his cultivation suppressed, then he would definitely die if he encountered someone from the Nether Pavilion. It was even to the extent that as far as he was concerned, Yang Ye may be trying to lure him into the lower dimensions!

But if he didn’t head down there, then even if Yang Ye didn’t tire him to death, Yang Ye might anger him to death!

He was a Rebirth Realm expert in the end, so it didn’t take long for him to calm himself down.

The old man gazed at the door for a long time, and then a cold smile curled up on the corners of his lips while he sat down cross-legged on the ground.

…

The lower dimensions.

At this moment, Yang Ye hadn’t started to suffer backlash from his sword intent. Because he hadn’t fought an intense battle with the old man earlier, and he’d just attacked and left, so merely his profound energy had been exhausted. Every time he raised his sword intent to the Returnal Rank, it would last for around four hours, and he would need another two hours or more to replenish his profound energy.

In other words, he could head up to the large world twice with every time he raised his sword intent to the Returnal Rank.

The reason he didn’t utilize another Energy Pearl was because Energy Pearls were too precious, and it was best to keep them to be utilized at a critical moment.

The Primordial Pagoda had abundant spirit energy within it, and it greatly improved the speed he recovered at. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Around two hours later, Yang Ye returned to the outside world, and then he transformed into a ray of light that shot up into the sky. It didn’t take long for him to pass through Heaven’s Door.

The black robed old man was still there!

Yang Ye didn’t waste his breath and just attacked. At the moment his sword vanished, the black robed old man was instantly pushed over 1km away. Yang Ye didn’t stop and continued. It didn’t take long for the old man to be pushed over 3km away. At this moment, Yang Ye had finished executing all three attacks!

Once he finished the last attack, Yang Ye turned around with the intent to flee. However, his face became unsightly when he turned around. Because an old man in a grey linen robe was standing before the door.

A Rebirth Realm expert!

As soon as he saw the old man, Yang Ye knew that he couldn’t escape!

“Run! Why aren’t you running?” Suddenly, the black robed old man’s voice resounded. After he fell into that dilemma, he’d decided to get help. Even though it was humiliating because he was a Rebirth Realm expert while Yang Ye was just a Semi-Deity, he had no choice. Yang Ye was being too shameless. If this continued, it was very likely that Yang Ye would tire him to death!

Yang Ye turned to look at the black robed old man and said, “Do you have no shame? A Rebirth Realm expert like you actually got help against a Semi-Deity like me? Do you have any shame? Do you?”

The black robed old man’s face became absolutely unsightly when he heard Yang Ye. Meanwhile, Yang Ye added, “To be honest, you’ve brought utter shame to Rebirth Realm experts.”

The black robed old man’s face grew even more unsightly.

Meanwhile, the old man behind Yang Ye spoke abruptly, “Then why don’t you fight him in single combat. I won’t interfere. Alright?”

The black robed old man immediately added, “Yang Ye, if you fight me in single combat, then I guarantee that he won’t interfere. You…”

“Do both of you have any shame?” Suddenly, Yang Ye ridiculed, “A Rebirth Realm expert wants to fight a Semi-Deity like me in single combat? Tsk, tsk. To think both of you were even able to speak such words.”

Once he spoke up to this point, Yang Ye’s tone changed, “Why don’t we do this? You suppress your cultivation to the Semi-Deity Realm like me, and we’ll have a fair fight. Alright?” Yang Ye shot a provocative gaze at the old man.

The black robed old man gazed at Yang Ye for a long time before he said, “Yang Ye, that’s such a joke. Why should I suppress my cultivation to fight you fairly? If I win, I gain nothing from it; but if I lose, it’ll be even worse for me. Yang Ye, you’re an outstanding genius, so I have to say that it’s quite embarrassing for you to try playing such tricks at a time like this!”

Yang Ye shrugged. He’d underestimated the old man’s intelligence. If the old man really suppressed his cultivation, then Yang Ye was absolutely certain he could kill the old man. Unfortunately, the old man was no fool and didn’t fall for it!

Meanwhile, the black robed old man spoke abruptly, “Attack him together! Don’t give him a chance to escape!”

As he spoke, he shot towards Yang Ye.

Even though Yang Ye was a sword cultivator, Yang Ye had many tricks up his sleeve. So, for safety’s sake, the black robed old man had asked the grey robed old man to attack with him. While two Rebirth Realm experts attacking a single Semi-Deity was quite humiliating, they couldn’t be bothered about that.

The grey robed old man hesitated for a moment and charged at Yang Ye as well!

Yang Ye took a deep breath and patted his chest, “Qiong Qi, if you still refuse to show yourself, then we’re really going to die together.”

As soon as Yang Ye finished speaking, a ray of black light flashed, and then a vicious aura suddenly erupted from Yang Ye. The aura was extremely strong, and it pushed both the old men around 1km away!

The black light dispersed to reveal Qiong Qi’s figure!

Qiong Qi!

Yang Ye heaved a sigh of relief when he saw Qiong Qi. Because if Qiong Qi still refused to come out, then Yang Ye would have no choice but to utilize the Stellar Sword Diagram. Yang Ye really didn’t want to utilize that diagram unless he had no other choice. After all, it literally took his life!

Meanwhile, Qiong Qi glanced at the two old men, and then he looked at Yang Ye, “I knew that when you call for me, it’ll definitely not be anything good.”

Yang Ye smiled with embarrassment, and then he said, “I naturally can’t trouble you for ordinary things. I had no other choice because these fellows’ cultivations are much greater than mine, and they are even using numbers against me. So, I had no choice but to seek your help.”

Qiong Qi glanced at the black robed and grey robed old man, and then he said, “They’re very strong!”

Yang Ye nodded, “How’s your strength?”

Qiong Qi spoke solemnly, “I’ve recovered by around 80%!”

Yang Ye was delighted, “Can you deal with both of them?”

Qiong Qi shook his head slightly, “I can only keep one busy! I’m not completely confident in my ability to defeat any one of them!”

Yang Ye nodded, “Alright, one is better than none!”

Meanwhile, a trace of seriousness had flashed through the black robed and grey robed old man’s eyes when they saw Qiong Qi.

A vicious beast!

They hadn’t expected that Yang Ye was carrying a demon beast with him, and it was even so strong. Even if that beast wasn’t at the Rebirth Realm, it was definitely an existence comparable to a peak Dualism Realm cultivator!

The black robed old man’s face was absolutely gloomy. He’d thought that he would definitely be able to kill Yang Ye after one more Rebirth Realm expert had come to assist him. However, he hadn’t expected that Yang Ye would have help!

Both of them exchanged glances, and then they shot towards Yang Ye and Qiong Qi!

If they allowed Yang Ye to enter the large world today, then the War Pavilion and Emperor Sect would become the laughingstock of the entire large world. Because once that Rebirth Realm expert from the Ma Clan left, many powers in the large world had found out about what happened here in the Heavenpath. Moreover, everyone was aware that the War Pavilion and Emperor Sect had enmity with Yang Ye and had even specially sent experts to kill Yang Ye!

Under such circumstances, if they were to allow Yang Ye to enter the large world, then the War Pavilion and Emperor Sect would be utterly humiliated! Besides that, Yang Ye’s potential was so terrifying. Once he was allowed to enter the large world and grow, then he would be a disaster that even the Emperor Sect and War Pavilion would find difficult to resist. Even though Yang Ye was their enemy, as far as they were concerned, Yang Ye’s future accomplishments would definitely not be inferior to Jian Wuji and the Unfettered One!

Such a person couldn’t be allowed to grow!

So, both the old men had attacked decisively.

Yang Ye and Qiong Qi were naturally unwilling to display any weakness or fear, and they immediately charged at the old men.

Just like that, a battle broke out here again.

After he consumed an Energy Pill, Yang Ye’s profound energy was completely replenished. But it was still quite strenuous for him to go head-on against a Rebirth Realm expert. Conversely, Qiong Qi was in a much better state than him. Even though Qiong Qi was being suppressed by the grey robed old man as well, the grey robed wasn’t able to inflict any real harm to Qiong Qi!

However, Qiong Qi was similarly unable to inflict any real harm on the grey robed old man.

A short while passed before Yang Ye sent Qiong Qi a voice transmission, “We have to retreat!”

Qiong Qi said, “Kid, you’re shrinking back from a battle? That isn’t your style!”

Yang Ye spoke angrily, “Style my ass! Shamelessness is the way!”

Qiong Qi spoke coldly, “If you can’t win, then just admit it. Shamelessness? I look down on you!”

Suddenly, the door that led to the large world shook violently, and then another old man walked out from it!

A Rebirth Realm expert!

Another Rebirth Realm expert!

“Kid! Retreat!” Qiong Qi’s voice suddenly resounded in Yang Ye’s mind. After that, he transformed into a ray of black light that entered Heaven’s Door.

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.
