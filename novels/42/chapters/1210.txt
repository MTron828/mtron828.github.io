Chapter 1211 – He Asked Me To Do It!

The eyes of that Emperor from the Dark Sky Sect remained open even until the moment of his death. Never had he imagined that Yang Ye would actually dare to come back. After all, there were over 20 Emperors here! Over 20! How could Yang Ye dare to come back?

But Yang Ye had!

Everyone gazed at Yang Ye with astonishment and actually forgot to attack.

Yang Ye waved his hand and stored the corpse that was just about to emit spirit energy. Presently, there were too many people here, so it was best to let Snowy absorb the spirit energy in secret.

“All of you intend to destroy my Sword Alliance?” Yang Ye glanced at them and said, “So long as all of you dare to come, then I’ll definitely make it so that you never leave!”

“Is that so? I, Xiao Tian, would like to see you do that!” Suddenly, a voice resounded from the sky, and then a beam of golden light shot down from above. It was extremely swift and instantly arrived above Yang Ye.

Om!

At practically the exact same moment that the beam of golden light appeared, a ray of sword energy shot up into the sky and collided with it.

Bang!

An explosion resounded, and then countless rays of golden energy and sword energy shot towards the surroundings. Meanwhile, a huge golden palm suddenly tore through the sky and instantly appeared above Yang Ye.

A cold smile curled up on the corners of Yang Ye’s mouth while he drew his sword and swung it.

Om!

A sword howl resounded as a ray of sword energy shot up into the sky!

It was enhanced by Rebirth Realm sword intent!

Once it was enhanced by Rebirth Realm sword intent, Yang Ye’s sword energy was countless times stronger. Everywhere it passed, even space was instantly torn open.

Hiss!

The sword energy instantly slashed through the huge golden palm, and then it continued forward and shot towards the sky.

Bang!

A loud explosion resounded through the sky, and then Xiao Tian’s voice resounded right after that, “What are all of you still standing there for?”

The others immediately recovered from their shock when they heard him, and they were about to attack. However, Yang Ye transformed into a ray of light that vanished on the spot. Their faces sank when they saw him vanish. It wasn’t that they refused to pursue him, he was too swift. He was swift to the point they couldn’t catch up at all.

A ray of golden light flashed, and Xiao Tian appeared here.

Xiao Tian clenched his fists as he looked up at the sky, and his face was horrifyingly gloomy. Yang Ye had trespassed into the Dark Sky Sect, killed 2 of its Emperors in succession, and swaggered off. It could be said that the Dark Sky Sect’s reputation was destroyed. But that wasn’t the end of it! Most importantly, he, the sect master, was the last remaining Emperor in the Dark Sky Sect.

Even if they could crush the Sword Alliance, the Dark Sky Sect would be reduced to a 2nd rate power!

Xiao Tian closed his eyes. At this moment, Yang Ye was the one he wanted to kill the most, and it was actually the deceased Yuan Tianyi. The Dark Sky Sect didn’t have to go head on against the Sword Alliance. Because he’d asked Yuan Tianyi to resolve the enmity between them and the Sword Alliance that day. After all, there wasn’t much conflict of interest between them and the Sword Alliance.

However, Yuan Tianyi had chosen to fight the Sword Alliance to the death for his granddaughter’s sake. Not only had it caused the Dark Sky Sect to lose many Emperors, it had caused Yuan Tianyi’s own death, and even made the Dark Sky Sect into a 2nd rate power!

But all of this could have been avoided!

Suddenly, a grey robed old man appeared here.

The World Devastator Cult!

Xiao Tian opened his eyes and gazed at the old man, “You were hiding in the shadows from the very beginning. Why didn’t you do anything?”

The old man replied, “Sect Master Xiao, I understand how you feel. But I hope that you understand that even I hadn’t expected Yang Ye to actually dare to attack the Dark Sky Sect. I was caught off guard as well.”

Meanwhile, Dugu Tianwei spoke abruptly, “The World Devastator Cult wants us to crush the Sword Alliance yet stays in the shadows. Are you trying to make use of us as cannon fodder?”

The others gazed at the grey robed old man as well. If it was before this, they would definitely not act so aggressively. But now that they’d witnessed how terrifying Yang Ye was, they were extremely displeased that the World Devastator Cult hadn’t sent any of its experts. Because it was the World Devastator Cult that wanted to crush the Sword Alliance, but it made them fight the Sword Alliance to the death.

Earlier, all of them felt that crushing the Sword Alliance wasn’t a big deal at all. After all, they formed a group of over 20 Emperors! But the Sword Alliance only had a few Emperors. Yet now, they realized that even if they could crush the Sword Alliance, they would probably suffer heavy losses. Because Yang Ye was too terrifying!

No one was willing to face him!

The grey robed old man glanced at Dugu Tianwei and said, “City Governor Dugu, my World Devastator Cult has no intention to use all of you. I presume that Vice Sect Master Yuan told al of you that Yang Ye might be backed by someone. Now, allow me to tell all of you clearly that it isn’t just likely, Yang Ye is definitely backed by someone. The experts of my World Devastator Cult noticed that an extremely mysterious expert has been staying by Yang Ye’s side. However, that expert seems to have noticed us when we noticed him. So, that expert has hidden himself. But we are certain that expert is definitely hiding in the shadows and waiting for the right moment to act!”

Xiao Tian frowned, “There are other powers on the continent?”

“Of course!” The grey robed old man glanced at them and said, “Everyone, even though the continent has suffered decline, don’t forget that our continent was once a medium world. At that time, there were countless sects and clans. While many have vanished, vanishing doesn’t represent destruction. Many sects and clans have survived until now, but most have chosen to live in seclusion. My World Devastator Cult was like that in the past, but we rejoin in the affairs of the world!”

The others revealed solemn expressions when they heard this. They’d thought that they were the top powers of the continent, but now it would seem like it wasn’t the case.

The grey robed old man added, “All of you think that this is my World Devastator Cult’s business. But allow me to ask all of you something. Once the Sword Alliance is allowed to rise to power, then what would all of you do if conflict arises between you and the Sword Alliance? Just like Doomsday City. Would you have the ability to resist the Sword Alliance? If I’m to be honest, all of you would probably be unable to resist it even if you joined forces. Not to mention anything else, just that fellow, Yang Ye, alone is sufficient to put all of you in a terrible situation.”

They fell silent.

The grey robed man glanced at them and continued, “The resources on the continent are currently being split between us. Do all of you wish for a 3rd party to interfere in that? If you don’t wish for that to happen, then you only have a single choice, and it’s to join forces and crush both the Sword Alliance and the mysterious power standing behind it.”

A long moment of silence ensued before Xiao Tian spoke abruptly, “Have you finished investigating the power standing behind Yang Ye?”

The old man shook his head, “My World Devastator Cult is aware of some clans and sects that are living in seclusion, but it isn’t any one of them. The power standing behind Yang Ye is just like him, both are extremely mysterious. However, there’s no need to be fearful. My World Devastator Cult will deal with the power standing behind Yang Ye, and all of you just have to deal with the Sword Alliance.”

“The Sword Alliance isn’t a huge deal. But that fellow, Yang Ye....” Xiao Tian spoke solemnly, “His strength is too monstrous. None of us is able to fight him!” VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

The grey robed old man replied, “Don’t worry, there’ll naturally be someone to deal with him!”

Xiao Tian asked, “Who?”

A smile curled up on the corners of the old man’s mouth, “You’ll know when the time comes. All of you rest tonight and set out for the Sword Alliance in 2 days from now. Remember that as a preventative measure against Yang Ye’s surprise attacks, all of you have to be on guard at all times from now on.”

Xiao Tian frowned, “Why aren’t we setting out now?”

The old man looked up at the sky and said, “Because the person who’ll deal with Yang Ye needs 2 days to get here!”

...

At a mountain range a few thousand kilometers away from the Dark Sky Sect, Yang Ye sat cross-legged on a huge smooth rock by the side of a lake. The corpses of 2 Emperors that Snowy had finished absorbing spirit energy from were lying in front of Yang Ye.

Refining the corpses of Emperors wasn’t difficult for Yang Ye anymore. After just 2 hours, both the corpses had been refined into Sword Servants. From this moment onwards, Yang Ye had 11 Emperor Realm Sword Servants with him. If the Sword Servant by Ye Liuyun’s side was included, then he had a total of 12 Emperor Realm Sword Servants!

But Yang Ye knew that it was far from sufficient.

Not to mention the World Devastator Cult, just the joint forces of the Dark Sky Sect and the other powers greatly outnumbers the number of Emperors that the Sword Alliance possessed. If the World Devastator Cult was included, then the Sword Alliance wouldn’t have even the slightest advantage over them. That was why he wanted Jian Xu to contact the experts who once belonged to the Sword God’s Palace. It couldn’t be helped, the Sword Alliance was weak, and it couldn’t defeat the joint forces of the World Devastator Cult and the other powers with just those few Emperors it possessed!

Especially the World Devastator Cult, it had merely revealed the tip of the iceberg when it came to its strength!

Yang Ye glanced at the Sword Servants before him, waved his right hand, and put them away. After that, he patted his chest and Snowy’s head instantly emerged from there.

Yang Ye stretched out his palm. Snowy blinked before holding Yang Ye’s hand and rubbing her head gently against the center of his palm. After that, she waved her right claw and a small hill of violet crystals appeared before Yang Ye.

Over 20,000 violet crystals!

Yang Ye sighed endlessly with emotion as he gazed at the hill of violet crystals. When he’d just arrived at Dark Hell Continent, violet crystals were like the stars in the sky. Yet now, they were no different than rocks to him!

Yang Ye shook his head and put them away. Meanwhile, 6 rays of light flashed by, and then Jian Xu and 5 other old men appeared in front of Yang Ye.

An old man who carried a sword on his back walked over to Yang Ye and asked, “You’re the Founding Ancestor’s successor?”

Yang Ye nodded. Was he Jian Wuji’s successor? Actually, it depended on him. If he wanted to be it, then he was; if he didn’t want to, then he wasn’t!

Now, he wanted it!

The old man asked, “Where’s your proof?”

Yang Ye took a step forward, and then it was like a million mountains were descending towards the old man. The old man moved backwards repeatedly, and he only stopped after traveling over 50m back.

“Sword intent above the Void Rank!” All 5 of them gasped, and their eyes were filled with shock.

They exchanged glances, and then the old man with the sword on his back said, “Why have you summoned us?”

Yang Ye replied, “Sword cultivation is waning. I intend to allow sword cultivation to prosper once more!”

The old man asked, “Why isn’t your goal to rebuild the Sword God’s Palace?”

Yang Ye looked the old man in the eyes and said, “Why can’t you look a little further?”

The old man asked in a low voice, “What are you trying to say?”

Yang Ye looked up at the sky and said, “I want the entire universe to respect us sword cultivators!” As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye gazed at the 5 old men and continued, “Right, it’s Senior Jian Wuji’s desire as well. He asked me to do it.”
