Chapter 2372 – 36 Yin Yang Techniques!

Mutual cultivation!

The world was divided into Yin and Yang, and all things had their counterpart. If there was Yin, there was Yang, and the union of Yin and Yang was a type of Grand Dao too.

In the beginning, it wasn’t very smooth, but they grew more and more proficient as time passed. Many positions appeared in Bai Zhixian’s mind, and they were called Yin Yang Techniques in the Yin Yang Sect. There were a total of 36 of them, and they were fuchsia, pushing the cart, seated on a lotus, descending the mountain…”

Each had their own benefits.

In the beginning, Bai Zhixian wasn’t very proficient in these techniques, but as they grew more and more into it, it didn’t take long for those positions to be used, one after the other.

As for Yang Ye, he’d experienced a different kind of pleasure.

It was something impossible to describe with words!

Two hours later.

Yang Ye laid by the pool, and Bai Zhixian was in his arms.

The pool was in a mess.

Bai Zhixian’s face was quite rose as if she’s been drinking.

Yang Ye rubbed something in his right hand as he spoke softly, “Fate is truly miraculous!”

When he arrived at Eternal Dimension, he’d almost killed her, and she’d almost killed him. But in the blink of an eye, they had become an intimate pair.

Many people didn’t think much of the relationship between men and women on their path of cultivation, and countless engaged in one night stands to gain what they wanted. But Yang Ye refused to do that. Since he’d chosen to be with someone, it was forever.

Bai Zhixian spoke softly in his arms, “Actually, I really miss the days in Eternal Village.”

Eternal Village!

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly. Actually, he missed it a little too. In that place, he didn’t have to think about anything, and he felt no pressure. It was very peaceful. Moreover, he missed the people there like Butcher, the slovenly old man, Auntie Vege, and Wang Erya’s grandfather!

Suddenly, Bai Zhixian sat on Yang Ye, smiled seductively, and said, “There’s a move in my technique called “Beauty Plays the Flute”. Would you like to try it?”

Yang Ye was stunned. Meanwhile, Bai Zhixian suddenly slid down, and then her head went underwater.

Yang Ye slowly clenched his fists.

Two hours later, Yang Ye left the Primordial Pagoda.

Outside the Primordial Pagoda, there was a bonfire not too far away from Nanli Meng. She glanced at Yang Ye, “Cultivating?”

Yang Ye nodded, “Cultivating.”

Actually, it wasn’t wrong. While they had been mutually cultivating, he’d gained from it. The Yin Yang Sect was a top-rate sect during the Primal Era. So, their cultivation technique was definitely not something ordinary. Even though the mutual cultivation hadn’t allowed him to instantly advance in his realm of cultivation, it had improved his cultivation. Moreover, it was quite an increase too. According to what he thought, he should engage in more mutual cultivation. He was certain that it wouldn’t be long before he attained the True World Realm!

Nanli Meng ignored Yang Ye. She sat cross-legged and ceaselessly read the scroll before her.

Yang Ye asked, “You wrote this?”

“Yes!” Nanli Meng spoke softly without looking up.

Yang Ye said, “What’s in it?”

Nanli Meng glanced at him and said, “One Divine Treasure.”

Yang Ye closed his eyes as if he hadn’t asked.

She chuckled, “Let me tell you that even 100 Divine Treasures won’t be able to buy this in the future.”

Yang Ye shrugged and didn’t say anything in response.

Silence ensued.

A long time later, a ray of brilliant sword energy flashed through the sky.

It shot up into the clouds and tore through the sky!

The sword howl drew both Yang Ye and Nanli Meng’s gazes.

They exchanged glances, and then they stood up and rushed in that direction.

“It’s that sword cultivator!” As they traveled, Nanli Meng spoke solemnly, “That sword cultivator who broke open this place’s restrictions.”

She suddenly stopped and gazed at Yang Ye, “If I’m not wrong, the experts of those powers are definitely in here. While their target is that sword cultivator, they will definitely attack you if they see you. So…”

Obviously, she was telling him to find a way to conceal himself!

Yang Ye thought for a moment, and then he covered himself in a black robe. While he didn’t fear ordinary Limitbreaker Realm experts, they had many experts together. If he encountered all of them, he would definitely suffer.

When he had sufficient strength, he didn’t have to keep a low profile, but when he didn’t have sufficient strength, it was best to do so. Only a fool wouldn’t keep a low profile when he didn’t have sufficient strength!

Nanli Meng nodded, “Let’s go!”

She sped up once she finished speaking.

They didn’t choose to fly. In a place like this, flying was too obvious. They were here to find treasures and not look for trouble.

They passed through a forest and arrived at a swamp.

Nanli Meng stopped by the swamp. She gazed at it for a long time, and then she turned around to look at Yang Ye, “Ask that little fellow if there’s anything dangerous here!”

Yang Ye was stunned.

“Hurry up!” Nanli Meng said, “That little fellow is very sensitive to danger. Just ask her.”

Yang Ye summoned Snowy and pointed at the swamp, “Is there any danger here?”

Snowy rubbed her drowsy eyes, and then she rubbed Yang Ye’s chest with slight dissatisfaction. She had been sleeping.

Yang Ye felt quite helpless.

Nanli Meng said, “Little Fellow, is there danger here? Help us…”

Nanli Meng’s face suddenly became unsightly.

Because the little fellow on Yang Ye’s chest was snoring again!

Nanli Meng shook her head and sighed, “She’s definitely a fake Sprite Progenitor, a fake, absolutely a fake!”

Yang Ye patted Snowy’s butt lightly and said, “Little Fellow, help me see if it’s dangerous here.”

Snowy rubbed her butt, glanced at the swamp, then shook her head. After that, she hugged Yang Ye’s neck and fell asleep while hanging onto his neck.

Yang Ye felt quite helpless. He lifted her up to his shoulder and gazed at Nanli Meng, “There’s no danger. Let’s go!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he tapped his right foot against the ground and leaped up into the air, descending at the center of the swamp. Nanli Meng followed closely behind him.

The swamp was huge, much larger than they’d expected. They kept jumping for almost an hour before they saw the end of it.

Yang Ye descended onto a piece of wood, and he was about to jump again when his expression suddenly changed drastically. His figure shot up into the sky. Meanwhile, a huge black shadow shot up from within the swamp and tried to bite him.

Yang Ye finally saw it clearly.

It was a colossus like a crocodile, but it was slightly different. It had a pair of horns, a row of spikes on its back, and a long tail that seemed like that of a dragon!

Yang Ye’s expression was extremely unsightly. He glared at Snowy who had an innocent expression on her face, and then swung his sword with both hands.

It was like the sky was being split apart beneath his sword!

Hiss!

A ray of blood red light descended.

Bang!

The colossus’ aura was instantly slashed apart, but Yang Ye’s sword energy wasn’t even able to break through its defenses at all. Conversely, the colossus slammed through his sword energy and arrived before him. Yang Ye frowned at the sight of this and was about to get serious. However, Snowy suddenly clapped her paws together, and then Yang Ye saw a familiar figure!

Oxxy!

Oxxy appeared before them, and then it slammed its fist down!

Bang!

The sky shook violently, and Oxxy was blasted away. As for the colossus, it was slammed onto the swamp as well. But it only took a moment for it to charge up at Oxxy again.

Moreover, a powerful wave of pressure surged out from the colossus!

Yang Ye frowned when he sensed the pressure!

Dragon Pressure!

He actually sensed Dragon Pressure!

Meanwhile, Nanli Meng suddenly said, “A Primal Dragon Croc, a powerful creature, a very powerful creature.”

She gazed at Snowy and said, “Didn’t you say that there’s no danger here?”

Snowy blinked, and then she pointed at the Primal Dragon Croc that was fighting Oxxy. She was clearly asking Nanli Meng if that was even considered as dangerous.

The corners of Yang Ye’s mouth twitched.

Was it dangerous?

Demons like these were truly of no threat to Snowy. As for why it hadn’t sensed Snowy’s presence, it was because Yang Ye had hidden her and himself with the Sword Domain.

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts and gazed at the Primal Dragon Croc. Could Snowy make that big fellow join them?

That Primal Dragon Croc was at the Limitbreaker Realm at the very least. If they could recruit it, it would be a huge help to them. However, he was a little hesitant. These primal creatures were very strong and were usually unwilling to submit. Oxxy and the Primal True Dragon had only submitted because they were considered to be young, so they were innately afraid of Snowy, or it should be said that they wanted to curry favor with Snowy.

However, the Primal Dragon Croc wasn’t mentally a child!

He could see ferocity, viciousness, and the desire to kill within its eyes!

Oxxy was clearly no match for it, and Oxxy was being suppressed by it and had suffered many blows.

Snowy blinked when she noticed this, and then she withdrew an ethereal axe. She was about to fight herself. However, she seemed to have thought of something and gazed at Yang Ye.

She knew the limits of her own strength…

She was really not skilled at fighting!

Yang Ye smiled and was about to attack. However, Erya suddenly appeared beside Yang Ye. She stopped him and gazed at Oxxy, “Don’t. It’s about to evolve. No, advance.”

Advance?

Suddenly, Oxxy howled with fury. In an instant, it grew dozens of times larger. At this moment, it was much larger than the Primal Dragon Croc. At the same time, a powerful aura swept out of Oxxy, and space rippled before it!

Yang Ye was stunned.

The World Lord Realm?

Oxxy actually attained the World Lord Realm?Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Suddenly, Oxxy gazed at Snowy and stretched out its hand. Snowy blinked, and then she understood what it meant. She immediately tossed the axe in her grasp at Oxxy. As soon as it entered Oxxy’s grasp, the axe grew dozens of times larger!

Yang Ye and Nanli Meng’s faces changed at the sight of this.

Yang Ye felt that a swing of Oxxy’s axe could chop open the world!
