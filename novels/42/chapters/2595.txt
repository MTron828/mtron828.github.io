Chapter 2596

On the bridge, Yang Ye flew almost 3 km before finally stopping.

Once he did, Yang Ye stumbled and fell to the ground. Blood covered the ground where he fell.

A pity!

At this moment, Yang Ye felt that it was quite a pity. Because that attack had almost succeeded! Unfortunately, the old man had restored his cultivation at the critical moment and undergone a qualitative improvement in strength.

The gap between them was too huge!

The old man glanced at his chest, and there was a bloody injury there from Yang Ye’s sword.

A sword injury!

If he hadn’t restored his cultivation, he wouldn’t have been able to stop that attack!

He would have been sliced into two!

The old man looked up at Yang Ye, “Needless to say, you’ve really surprised me.” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Yang Ye chuckled, “You surprised me too. Of course, I’m not very surprised.”

The old man grinned, “I said that I would suppress my cultivation to force out your limits, but I never said that I would fight you to the death at the Lord Realm, right?”

Yang Ye shrugged, “Let’s just stop wasting our breaths and fight.”

The old man nodded slightly, “It’s time to end this.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he raised his right hand slightly. In an instant, a strand of invisible energy rippled out from his palm. Moreover, numerous arrows of Boundless Water shot up into the air from down below and shot at Yang Ye!

But that wasn’t even the end of it. Even the old man vanished on the spot.

This time, he clearly didn’t plan to hold back.

Along with the appearance of numerous strands of powerful energy, the bridge started to tremble.

Yang Ye closed his eyes slowly.

Retreat?

No, he couldn’t!

Fight!

He could only fight!

The intent sword in Yang Ye’s grasp shook, and then it started to turn ethereal. Meanwhile, the water arrows and a wave of powerful energy swept over to Yang Ye.

Yang Ye’s sword stabbed forward. The water arrows were forced to a stop, but along with the arrival of the bald old man, a wave of powerful energy enveloped Yang Ye.

Bang!

The sword shattered, and Yang Ye was blasted away!

At the same time, the water arrows that had been stopped by Yang Ye’s Sword Domain shot forward again. A moment later, Yang Ye’s figure stiffened on the spot while numerous bloody holes appeared on his chest!

The old man didn’t stop and swung a punch.

Boom!

A wave of powerful energy slammed against Yang Ye’s stomach, causing him to be blasted away. He flew over 10 km away.

Bang!

Yang Ye crashed to the ground, causing the entire bridge to tremble.

The Divine Abode.

The Desolate Emperor gazed at Yang Ye from the third floor and had a playful smile on his face, “He’s going to die if you don’t act now.”

Actually, it wasn’t just him. At this moment, many other powers were watching from the shadows.

The battle on the bridge was too intense, and it had alarmed countless powers.

On the bridge.

The old man walked in Yang Ye’s direction with the pitch black square block on his back. Yang Ye just laid there while blood surged out like a fountain from him.

The ground in a huge area around him had been dyed red with blood!

Suddenly, the old man stopped because Yang Ye was slowly crawling up from the ground. Once he got to his feet, he supported himself against the bridge’s railing while using an intent sword to keep himself standing.

The old man glanced at Yang Ye, “Do you have anything else to show me?”

Yang Ye wiped off the blood on the corner of his mouth, “I don’t think so!”

The old man smiled, “So, are you ready to die?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “I suddenly recalled that I do have another move.”

Yang Ye cracked a smile, and then flames arose around him.

He'd ignited his soul!

The old man’s eyes narrowed slightly. He hadn’t expected Yang Ye to actually choose to ignite his soul!

Soul Ignition meant that Yang Ye wasn’t giving himself any chance to survive!

The Desolate Emperor’s eyes narrowed slightly. Even he hadn’t expected Yang Ye to do that, and he wondered if those who supported Yang Ye weren’t going to show themselves!

The Desolate Emperor was quite bewildered.

The flames around Yang Ye grew brighter and brighter. He wasn’t joking, and he was absolutely serious!

He was really igniting his soul!

Even if he died, he was going to die with dignity.

Yang Ye closed his eyes. At this moment, he thought of many, many things and people.

The scenes of the past kept flashing through his mind.

The truth was that he wanted to live because he had too many things he wasn’t willing to give up. However, when death was inevitable, he faced it directly. While he had some regrets and worries, it wasn’t the worst possible situation.

Because even if he was gone, the Primordial Pagoda wouldn’t fall into the old man’s possession, nor would it fall into the possession of the Soul Sect or Eternal Kingdom.

That was all that mattered!

Yang Ye tightened his grip on his sword. At this moment, he felt his mind become quite blurry. He knew he didn’t have much time left, and if he didn’t attack now, he would have really killed himself for nothing.

Yang Ye suddenly felt slight anticipation. He looked forward to this attack because it was definitely the strongest attack he ever executed!

The old man clenched his fists slowly and became slightly vigilant.

Even though he was very confident, he wouldn’t allow himself to be conceited. This young man before him had truly surprised him, and he didn’t want to lose a battle that he was guaranteed to win!

The bald old man was about to attack when the flames around Yang Ye suddenly vanished. At the same time, Yang Ye slowly fell to the ground. But it was very slow to the point his figure was laid down gently on the ground.

The old man’s eyes narrowed slightly. He looked to the right, and a young girl was seated on the railing there.

The old man’s face was unprecedentedly solemn upon noticing her presence.

She was Qi Bitian of course.

Meanwhile, a young girl with pigtails appeared on the bridge. A moment later, she ran over to Yang Ye, and she started crying when she saw the state he was in.

The young girl with the pigtails was Lei Lin!

Qi Bitian glanced at Yang Ye and said, “He’s still alive, so why are you crying?”

Lei Lin wiped off her tears and waved her hands. A wave of powerful lightning enveloped Yang Ye, and then she took him into the Primordial Pagoda.

Once Yang Ye entered the pagoda, the entire pagoda was filled with clamorous noise.

At this moment, all the residents of the pagoda realized that Yang Ye had become important to them without them even realizing.

Outside the Primordial Pagoda. On the bridge.

Qi Bitian walked over to where Yang Ye had been. Yang Ye was gone now, but his blood remained.

A lot of blood!

She shook her head, “I seem to have broken my promise.”

The old man gazed at her vigilantly, “Who are you?”

Qi Bitian ignored the bald old man and squatted down. She gazed at the blood for a long time before she grinned, “Actually, it’s enough. I shouldn’t use my own standards on him. It isn’t really fair. After all, the times have changed.”

She stood up as she spoke and gazed at the old man, “Actually, I’m being serious when I say that I didn’t plan to do anything. However, at the moment he ignited his soul, I knew that he didn’t entrust his hopes to anyone. He did his best, and he was prepared to die. I think that he has done his best. I don’t wish for him to be absolutely outstanding, all I want is for him to try his best in everything. He did that!”

“And?” The old man suddenly chuckled, “Needless to say, he did do his best, and it’s truly rare that someone at the Lord Realm could fight me for so long. But I’d like to ask you what difference it makes? It’s absolutely meaningless because he’ll still die, right?”

Qi Bitian thought for a moment and said, “At most times, I dislike interfering because as far as I’m concerned, I’m really bullying all of you. Moreover, I’m not interested in all of you at all. It’s like how an elephant would have no interest in an ant.”

The bald old man’s face instantly turned icy cold, “Such high-sounding sentiments!”

Qi Bitian smiled, “But I realized that all of you are really going too far. You refused to let him leave, so he killed one of yours, then you sent an even stronger expert at him. But even that expert was killed, so you sent someone stronger. Yes, I’m talking about you. I thought he was without fear, but I noticed that all of you are actually worse.”

Qi Bitian walked slowly in the old man’s direction, “I remember you saying that once he’s dead, your organization is willing to bear any consequences. Now, listen well. I’m the person who stands behind him, and now, it’s time for you to bear the consequences!”

Qi Bitian raised her right hand slightly.

The old man’s eyes narrowed slightly. He didn’t dare to act carelessly and raised both his hands slightly. In an instant, the Boundless Water in the surroundings shook, and then numerous water arrows surged up into the air.

However, once Qi Bitian, pressed her right palm down, the water arrows returned to where they’d come from. At this moment, the Boundless Water had become extremely calm.

The old man glanced at the Boundless Water and was astounded, “You…”

Suddenly, Qi Bitian clawed at the old man from afar.

Boom!

The old man’s linen robe, a divine treasure on the verge of becoming a Super Divine Treasure, exploded apart and was obliterated!

The old man was shocked. At this moment, he didn’t dare to hold back at all, and the pitch black square block behind him transformed into a ray of dark light that shot at Qi Bitian.

Qi Bitian unfurled her right palm. The pitch black block stopped just around an inch away from Qi Bitian’s palm. Meanwhile, strands of strange energy rippled out incessantly from the boulder, and the Boundless Water on both sides of the bridge started to roil!

A Super Divine Treasure!

The square block was an actual Super Divine Treasure!

Meanwhile, Qi Bitian swung a punch.

Bang!

The old man watched with shock as the square block shook violently and exploded apart!

A Super Divine Treasure had been destroyed with a single punch!

The old man’s face turned pale while he gazed at her with terror in his eyes. At this moment, he was utterly stunned.

Qi Bitian waved her right hand gently, and a pillar of water surged up into the air on her right. No, it wasn’t a pillar, it was a dragon. At moment later, the dragon shot through the sky and slammed itself at the bald old man.

Meanwhile, a voice came from the sky, “Please show mercy!”

However, the water dragon didn’t stop and slammed against the old man.

Boom!

An explosion resounded, and the bald old man vanished without a trace. Moreover, a part of the bridge had been blasted apart!

It had been destroyed!

Meanwhile, an old man appeared not too far away from Qi Bitian. The old man was the same old man who’d refused Yang Ye outside of the Sky Palace.

The old man stared at Qi Bitian, “You’ve broken the rules here. You…”

“The rules?” Qi Bitian grinned, and then her figure instantly appeared before the old man. After that, she kicked his head before he could even react.

Bang!

The old man’s head shot off into the air and crashed to the ground.

Qi Bitian glanced at the surroundings, “Weren’t you willing to bear any consequence? Now, listen up! I’m about to make my move!”

As soon as she finished speaking, Qi Bitian stomped her right foot down.

Boom!

The part of the bridge beneath her collapsed, and the destruction was still spreading rapidly in all directions!
