Chapter 2724 – Explosive Madness!

Calm!

At this moment, the entire 9th layer of space had completely calmed down.

Snowy put down the Sprite Staff and Great Unknown, and then she flew over to Yang Ye and pushed herself into his arms. After that, her head tilted to the side, and she fell asleep.

Snowy’s chubby little face was covered in exhaustion!

Yang Ye held her in his arms and rubbed her head gently with a loving expression in his eyes. Obviously, the little fellow was absolutely exhausted!

Yin Yang Goddess suddenly asked, “Did she do something?”

Yang Ye glanced at Yin Yang Goddess and smiled, “Why don’t you give it a guess?”

She shook her head, “Forget it. But I guarantee that it’s definitely not anything good!”

She shot a weird glance at Yang Ye and continued, “Anyway, you’re truly amazing. You’re actually able to make the Good Sprite willingly stay with you. How did you do that?”

It wasn’t just her, countless were curious about that!

Even the few forms of Destiny!

What kind of existence had the Good Sprite been in the past?

She’d been an existence who almost crushed Destiny!

Yet now, she was staying with Yang Ye like a pet!

It was truly impossible to understand for most people!

Yang Ye glanced at her and smiled, “She wasn’t the Good Sprite when I met her!”

Yin Yang Goddess glanced at Yang Ye, and it was like she’d realized something.

Yang Ye placed Snowy within the Primordial Pagoda and left her in Su Qingshi’s care, and then he came back outside.

Yang Ye sized up the surroundings. This world had a sprite again!

However, only Snowy could make the sprite show itself because she’d created it.Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

A trump card!

Yang Ye grinned. If he were to fight others here and the sprite suddenly lent him a hand, it would definitely give his opponent a really “nice” surprise. However, he couldn’t expose the presence of the sprite here until then. Otherwise, the End World would definitely eliminate it in advance!

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts and looked up. He was about to leave when Yin Yang Goddess suddenly said, “Are you really planning on going beyond the 9th layer of space?”

Yang Ye nodded.

She spoke solemnly, “If I’m being honest, you probably won't make it back at this level of strength.”

Yang Ye smiled, “I know!”

Yin Yang Goddess frowned slightly, and it was even more charming than a woman’s frown.

However, Yang Ye was naturally immune to it. He was a sword cultivator at any rate, so he had that level of resistance.

Yang Ye smiled, “Senior, I came all this way from a very low level world, and there was another sword cultivator who came from there as well. That sword cultivator left much sooner than me. Of course, he's stronger than me too. He kept challenging others all along the way and ceaselessly gave himself difficulties to overcome. Do you know what happened after some time?”

Yin Yang Goddess replied indifferently, “If you have something to say, then say it!”

Yang Ye roared with laughter and said, “You must ceaselessly challenge yourself to improve yourself without end. Either live a peaceful life, or die in a fierce battle. Hahaha!”

As soon as he finished speaking, a ray of sword energy sliced through the sky!

Yin Yang Goddess fell silent.

In the beginning, she felt that Yang Ye had relied on fortuitous encounters, countless fortuitous encounters. Like the Good Sprite, Destiny’s protection… But now it seemed like Yang Ye did have fortuitous encounters, but he wasn’t ordinary either!

Not to mention anything else, just his courage and the hard work he put in was sufficient to embarrass countless.

Yang Ye shook his head and sighed within the spatial passageway.

Actually, he’d been forced to push himself that hard!

The strongest form of Destiny disliked him and wanted to eliminate him, then the group from the End World was targeting him at all times. Under such circumstances, he had no choice but to push himself! He would die otherwise!

In life, a person sometimes didn’t really want to be that hard working, and it may be life that forced the person to do so!

Yang Ye sped up in the spatial passageway. The space here couldn’t obstruct him anymore. Of course, it was pointless to stop him because the space in the 9th layer of space wasn’t difficult for him at all.

Only the space at the border of the Four Dimensional Universe could pose a threat to him. Only the space there was terrifying!

A short while later, Yang Ye stopped. The space before him started to tremble violently, and then strands of spatial energy swept toward him like the tide!

It was shocking!

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly, and he slowly tightened his grip on the Sword Precursor.

Actually, among all his swords, the Sword Precursor was definitely incapable of competing with the Great Unknown or Past Life, and it couldn’t even compete with Crimson Sky and the five element sword. However, it was the sword that knew him the best, and it felt the best in his grasp!

This sword had been with him for far too long.

Holding this sword felt the most real, and when he held Past Life and Great Unknown, he was mostly just using their strength!

The Sword Precursor trembled slightly in Yang Ye’s grasp, and Yang Ye closed his eyes slowly!

Focus and observe!

He hadn’t carefully studied the spatial energy here in the past, and he’d tried to break through it with brute force. However, he’d failed. So, he had to switch to a different tactic!

A short while later, the energy arrived before Yang Ye!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye opened his eyes and raised his palm, a moment later, his sword stabbed forward before he pulled it down.

Hiss!

The energy instantly had a gap sliced open in it, but it slammed against him.

Bang!

Yang Ye was blasted backward repeatedly, and he only stopped after being pushed over 5km away!

In the beginning, he’d been pushed almost 30km back, and he’d been blasted back in a sorry state. But this time, he’d only been pushed over 5km away. Moreover, he hadn’t suffered very serious injuries.

However, the energy still didn’t vanish, and it even grew increasingly terrifying.

Because there was incessant spatial energy sweeping over from there!

It was boundless!

Yang Ye didn’t choose to go head-on against it this time, he retreated incessantly while staring forward. His body and legs were moving, but he wasn’t breathing.

He was focused on looking for a place to strike!

If he wasn’t relying on overwhelming strength, he had to find the spot to strike. It was like how an ordinary person chopped wood. If the person struck from the corner, it may be the person’s arm that broke instead. However, if the person struck from the center, it was still possible for the person’s arm to break, but of course, it may be the wood that was split.

When absolute strength wasn’t an option, the position of the strike was especially important!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye was still retreating.

Because he had nowhere to strike!

As the spatial energy before him grew increasingly stronger, he noticed that the space there was too strong!

Overwhelming strength!

But it was the spatial energy that was doing it to him!

Just like that, Yang Ye kept retreating, and it wasn’t long before he noticed that he couldn’t retreat anymore!

Yang Ye stopped, tapped his right foot down, and then soared into the air. At the same time, two waves of energy appeared.

The dual Domains!

With the help of the dual Domains, the strength contained within Yang Ye’s sword instantly rose explosively!

The Domains weren’t external sources of strength, but he didn’t want to use his trump cards right in the beginning. He wanted to learn the extent of his strength and his own limits!

Now, he had to use the Domains!

Yang Ye leaped up with his sword in both hands and slashed down!

Since he couldn’t retreat, then his choice was to give it his all!

An ear piercing sound of something being sliced open resounded, but Yang Ye’s attack was forcibly stopped halfway!

Meanwhile, countless strands of sword intent and sword energy surged out from him!

The Sword Domain Sphere!

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!

The energy was ceaselessly destroyed and obliterated before Yang Ye, but it only took a moment for an endless stream of it to surge over from behind.

Just like that, they remained in a stalemate for dozens of breaths of time.

Boom!

An explosion resounded, and Yang Ye was blasted away!

A moment later, he returned to the 9th layer of space!

He was back!

He crashed to the ground and slammed open a huge hole there!

A long time passed before he crawled up slowly, and as soon as he did that, he fell flat on the ground again. It felt like he’d been using the 36 Yin Yang Techniques for multiple days without stop!

He was utterly exhausted and weak!

Yang Ye sat cross-legged on the ground and started recuperating. Just like that, two hours passed before a ray of sword energy shot up into that boundless expanse of space.

But it didn’t take long for Yang Ye to return to the 9th layer of space again. He was still in a very embarrassing state.

A month later.

Bang!

Yang Ye crashed to the ground again, but he stood back up swiftly, and then a ray of light vanished into the boundless expanse of space once more.

In the spatial passageway, Yang Ye walked slowly with his sword in hand. In the beginning, he was walking, but he gradually started to run while holding tightly to the hilt of his sheathed sword!

Yang Ye grew faster and faster. In the end, his speed was able to crack the space in his wake. Moreover, as his speed increased incessantly, his body started to tremble.

However, he was still speeding up!

He was growing faster and faster, and he even used sword energy and sword intent to speed himself up.

It didn’t take long for him to arrive at his limits. However, he was still speeding up with everything he had!

Crack!

At this moment, the space around him cracked open like a spiderweb, and the cracks were spreading rapidly.

A short while later, Yang Ye arrived at the border of the Four Dimensional Space, and countless strands of powerful spatial energy appeared once more and surged madly at him.

Yang Ye stared at the simply suffocating strands of spatial energy, and the distance between them grew closer and closer… However, his speed was still rising madly!

300m!

150m!

30m!

1m!

Finally, Yang Ye drew his sword and slashed.

Hiss!

The energy was forcibly sliced open, and Yang Ye’s figure didn’t slow down at all. He was still swinging his sword madly as he charged forward…

Heavenrend combined with the Madness Sword Technique!

Moreover, it was the explosive style of Heavenrend combined with the Madness Sword Technique!

Finally, after a long time, Yang Ye’s sword hit nothing.

He was in an expanse of outer space.

However, a pair of eyes soundlessly appeared above him.
