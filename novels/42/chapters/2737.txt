Chapter 2738 – Dream On!

In an instant, Yang Ye understood!

The End World had set a trap for him to make him the common enemy of Eternal Kingdom.

At this moment, Eternal Kingdom was occupied by the experts and powers from all over the universe. In other words, he had become their enemy!

Yang Ye frowned slightly. Besides a few peak existences, the ordinary experts were no threat to him. So, why would the End World do this?

Or perhaps they were just intentionally creating hatred toward him?

Yang Ye shook his head and walked away with Snowy.

Meanwhile, Huang Ying and the others appeared before Yang Ye.

Yang Ye glanced at them and remained silent.

Huang Ying hesitated for a moment and said, “Brother Yang, if you take the divine vein, it will take 10 years at most for Eternal Kingdom to become an abandoned kingdom. Not to mention 10 years later, even now, the spirit energy in many places has started to dry up.”

Yang Ye smiled, “And?”

Huang Ying fell silent.

Yang Ye glanced at them and said, “Alright, how about I give it to you?”

Their expressions turned quite unsightly.

Take it?

They couldn’t!

The End World couldn’t do anything to Yang Ye, but it could do everything to them. If they took it, it was obvious that the End World would definitely attack right away!

At that time, how would they resist the End World?

Yang Ye shrugged, “You refused, not me!”

Huang Ying laughed bitterly, “Brother Yang…”

Yang Ye shook his head, “It is not that I wish to take it from this place, nor am I trying to destroy Eternal Kingdom. There isn’t such great enmity between us anyway. I’m taking it because you don’t have the ability to protect it. Moreover, it’s willingly coming with me. I’m sure you saw that!”

All of them fell silent.

Yang Ye didn’t want to say more and was about to leave, but a man by Huang Ying’s side suddenly said, “Taking the divine vein away is like sending us to our doom. It isn’t just us, all the other cultivators of the entire universe and Eternal Kingdom will face the same fate! Please reconsider!”

Yang Ye stopped and gazed at the man, “Then tell me what I should do?”

The man replied solemnly, “Leave the divine vein here, of course.”

Yang Ye said, “I told you. I can leave it here. Even the divine vein said that so long as you’re willing to protect it, then it will stay. So, are you willing to protect it?”

The man’s expression turned unsightly, but it didn’t take long for him to say, “You’re a part of Eternal Kingdom, so why don’t you protect it with us?”

Yang Ye blinked and smiled, “Alright!”

Everyone here was stunned because Yang Ye had agreed just like that!

Yang Ye smiled, “Of course I realize that more friends is better than more enemies, and I’m willing to protect this divine vein with all of you. But…”

He cracked a smile at this point, “I’m sure you realize that my enemy is the End World, and some other mysterious existences. Since I’m helping you protect this divine vein, will you be willing to help me deal with them? We’re stronger when we’re together, and I’m sure we can crush them if we work together!”

The expressions of everyone here became quite interesting!

Join forces with Yang Ye?

That would represent having to face the End World, and even all of Yang Ye’s other enemies.

Yang Ye was very terrifying, but was the End World not terrifying too?

The surroundings fell silent!

Yang Ye gazed at the man who’d spoken earlier, “What? You don’t want to?”

The man replied solemnly, “You’re asking for something beyond our ability, you…”

Suddenly, an afterimage flashed.

Bam!

The man was blasted away.

The expressions of everyone here changed slightly, but no one dared to attack!

Yang Ye glanced coldly at the man who was ceaselessly rolling on the ground, “You wish to share the good yet not the bad? Just go home and sleep! You’ll get a lot of that in your dreams!”

Yang Ye walked away with Snowy.

They clearly wanted Yang Ye to protect Eternal Kingdom yet refused to do it with him. In short, they wanted Yang Ye to risk his life, and not only did they refuse to do the same, they wanted to reap the rewards.

That was what infuriated Yang Ye!

Huang Ying and the others remained silent as they watched him leave, and no one dared to stop him.

Stop him?

Yang Ye was even more terrifying than the End World when he went berserk!

Suddenly, Huang Ying spoke solemnly, “Start preparing.”

He turned around and left.

A short while later, the area was calm once more.

Along with the departure of the divine vein, the spirit energy throughout the Eternal Kingdom dispersed rapidly.

Now, every bit absorbed was a bit lost!

It wasn’t that bad for the large powers because they definitely had their own spirit veins. While they couldn’t compete with a divine vein, it wasn’t that bad. However, now that their greatest resource, the divine vein, was gone, their spirit veins were just a drop in the ocean they used to have.

It didn’t take long for everyone in Eternal Kingdom to find out that Yang Ye had taken the divine veins. So, countless started cursing him, and some even wanted to denounce him!

Denounce Yang Ye!

Of course, they merely shouted about it, but no one dared to go looking for Yang Ye.

However, Yang Ye had become a publicly hated person in Eternal Kingdom, and practically everyone wanted to take a swing at him!

…

The War Dimension.

On the city walls, Ye Zhibei and Liu Yuan stood side by side. Perhaps it was because of Yang Ye, but Ye Zhibei was one of the leading figures in the War Dimension now.

Everyone understood why!

It was because they hoped that Yang Ye would give her face when the War Dimension was in trouble and help them, or so that Ye Zhibei would help speak on their behalf!

Ye Zhibei didn’t refuse. She knew Yang Ye well. If you were close to him, he wouldn’t make a fuss about anything, and he would help no matter how difficult it was; but if you weren’t close to him, he wouldn’t be willing to give the person anything!

Regardless of whether it was in terms of repaying kindness or enmity, Yang Ye was a very extreme person!

Liu Yuan asked, “You’ve heard?”

Ye Zhibei nodded.

Liu Yuan smiled, “It isn’t a bad thing for us. At the very least, they will stop targeting us.”

Ye Zhibei spoke softly, “I heard many are denouncing him!”

Liu Yuan chuckled, “It’s very normal. Compared to the mighty and transcendent experts of the End World, Yang Ye isn’t that scary. I bet that if the End World took the divine vein, they wouldn’t dare to say a word. Do you know why?”

Ye Zhibei gazed at her, and she smiled, “Because Yang Ye is a person who stands by his principles. If you don’t infuriate him, he won’t go wild; but the End World is different, they reign supreme and look down at all life with indifference. No matter what they do, people will dare not say a thing about them without strength that surpasses them.”

She looked into the distant sky, “When it’s between a good and bad person, many always like to bully the good person. Because they think that the good are easy to bully. Conversely, not only would they dare not bully the bad, they would even endure being bullied by those bad people. It’s human nature to bully the weak and fear the strong.”

Ye Zhibei replied softly, “He isn’t a good person, but he isn’t a bad person either. However, if you infuriate him, he will be the most terrifying. I hope the people in Eternal Kingdom don’t court death!”Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Liu Yuan nodded. She’d experienced how terrifying he was.

The most recent incident was when Yang Ye came to the city to kill the Soul Sect’s master.

If it wasn’t for Ye Zhibei and the fact that she’d helped him in the past, Yang Ye would have probably destroyed the city too!

Ye Zhibei suddenly asked, “Are we going outside?”

Liu Yuan shook her head “No. We can think about it once the war outside is over. We’ll probably die for sure if we head outside now!”

Ye Zhibei nodded, “True!”

As she spoke, she looked up into the distance while a wisp of worry appeared in her eyes.

She hoped that day would actually come!

…

Once he left with Snowy, Yang Ye went to the 9th layer of space. This place was relatively safer throughout the Three Dimensional Universe because the sprite here was on his side!

If anyone was coming up here, he would know immediately.

Yang Ye returned to the Primordial Pagoda. As soon as he did, he sensed a strand of pure spirit energy!

It was the spirit energy of the divine vein!

The divine vein could be said to have caused the Primordial Pagoda to undergo a tremendous change. Especially the spirit energy here, it was absolutely abundant!

Of course, Snowy could do the same. However, she was very lazy. Asking her to provide spirit energy to this world every day? That was impossible!

She cultivated for a day and played for two more. As for the rest of her time, it was spent on playing too…

The divine vein had immediately entered the ground upon arriving here, and Yang Ye could clearly sense that everything in the Primordial Pagoda had started to undergo a gradual transformation!

The spirit energy here could be said to be the most abundant in the Three Dimensional Universe!

The only divine vein was here, and so was Snowy. It could be said that no place could compete with this world.

Yang Ye returned to his cultivation room. An Nanjing was still cultivating. He hadn’t disturbed her earlier!

Yang Ye sat down cross-legged and closed his eyes slowly.

Cultivate!

He’d already sensed that he was nearing a breakthrough, but because of the divine vein, he had no choice but to leave with Snowy. He naturally had to put Snowy’s desires first!

Charge into the limits of the Destiny Realm!

An Nanjing’s aura had vanished completely, and even Yang Ye couldn’t sense her while seated by her side!

Yang Ye laughed bitterly. Obviously, she was on the verge of a breakthrough!

She was the true monstrous genius!

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts and was about to begin. However, Su Qingshi suddenly appeared before him.

He gazed at her and she spoke slightly anxiously, “Hurry over quickly! Erya is trying to eat the divine vein! Snowy can’t hold her back for much longer!”

Yang Ye was stunned, and then he asked, “Her gluttony is acting up again?”
