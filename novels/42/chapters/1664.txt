Chapter 1665 - The Legend Of An Ancient Cultivator!

Translator: InVader

Everyone gazed at Yang Ye’s abdomen when they heard Ku Yuxing, and Yang Ye’s own expression had changed as well.

The atmosphere here became tense.

Suddenly, there was movement near Yang Ye’s abdomen, and then a pair of white claws stretched out from within Yang Ye’s clothes. It didn’t take long for a small head to emerge as well.

It was Snowy!

Snowy glanced at everyone, and then her head shrunk back behind his clothes. Only her eyes that were constantly blinking could be seen from the outside.

“A Sprite Lord!” A wisp of surprise flashed through Ku Yuxing’s eyes when he saw the little fellow, but it didn’t take long for his face to turn gloomy. Because the Soul Nurturing Tree wasn’t in Yang Ye’s possession!

The faces of Ku Rong and the old man in a luxurious robe had turned gloomy as well. Since it wasn’t in Yang Ye’s sea of consciousness, it meant that the Ku Clan had lost the bet. The bet wasn’t a big deal, but the Soul Nurturing Tree was gone!

Yang Ye rubbed Snowy’s head and gazed at Ku Yuxing, “Senior Ku, where’s the Hell Fruit you promised?”

Ku Yuxing gazed at Yang Ye for a very long time, and then he nodded before flicking a black fruit over to Yang Ye. However, Yang Ye hadn’t even seen it clearly when Yang Lin waved his right hand and took it.

Yang Ye glanced at Yang Lin and remained silent.

Yang Lin gazed at Ku Yuxing, “Brother Ku, let’s put an end to it here. Alright?”

Ku Yuxing chuckled, “Farewell!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he turned around and vanished on the spot with the others. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Meanwhile, Yang Lin and Yang Gewu’s faces fell.

A long moment of silence ensued before Yang Lin suddenly gazed at Yang Ye, “Why did you offend the Ku Clan?”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “What do you mean?”

“What do I mean?” Yang Gewu spoke abruptly, “Kid, do you realize that you almost died just now?”

Yang Ye nodded slightly, “I know.”

Yang Gewu was about to speak when Yang Lin suddenly said, “Enough. This kid knows nothing about the Ku Clan. What you say won’t make a difference.”

Yang Gewu glanced at Yang Ye and shook his head, “The ignorant are fearless!”

Yang Ye remained silent.

Meanwhile, Yang Lin gazed at Yang Ye, “The Ku Clan usually keeps a low profile, but their resources and reserves run deep. A very long time ago, there were no eight clans in this universe. At that time, there was only a single super clan. Do you know which clan it was?”

Yang Ye replied, “The Ku Clan?”

Yang Lin nodded slightly, “The Ku Clan. It broke apart due to a mishap, and that provided the other clans with a chance to rise up. After that, the Ku Clan kept even more to itself. However, the other clans including the currently powerful Ying Clan dare not rashly offend them. Do you know why?”

Yang Ye asked curiously, “Why?”

Yang Lin spoke solemnly, “Because an ancient cultivator once came from the Ku Clan!”

“An ancient cultivator?” Yang Ye was puzzled. He’d heard Qiong Qi speak about them, but he didn’t have a very good understanding of the concept.

Yang Lin explained, “A very, very long time ago, when humans had just appeared in this universe, the human race was the weakest race of living beings in Milky Way System. The human race was a race that was enslaved and slaughtered. This continued until numerous humans with extraordinary natural talent appeared in this world. They created all sorts of methods of cultivation, and the human race grew strong through cultivation. After that, the human race gradually escaped its fate of being enslaved and bullied by the other races.”

He looked up at the sky, fell silent for quite some time, and then continued, “That group of people didn’t just create all sorts of methods of cultivation, they also created our human civilization. Justice and loyalty were both created by them. That period was the most glorious period our human race experienced, and they are the earliest cultivators of our human race!”

The human civilization! Yang Ye felt deep reverence towards them. If the human race hadn’t been able to form such a civilization, how terrifying would it be? It could be said that their contribution to the human race was absolutely huge.

Meanwhile, Yang Lin added, “Unfortunately, for some unknown reason, they vanished. Moreover, they even fought and killed each other before vanishing!”

“They fought and killed each other?” Yang Ye frowned slightly, “What do you mean?”

Yang Lin shook his head, “I don’t know the details either. Because there are very few records about those ancient cultivators. There are no records of them in our history, and the only reason we know about them is because of the short records left behind in the ruins of their past abodes.”

He paused for a moment before he continued, “The reason they fought and killed each other seems to be because of differing views. In short, it isn’t important. What’s important is that an ancient cultivator once came from the Ku Clan. So, do you understand now?”

Yang Ye fell silent for a moment and replied, “That’s definitely not the extent of it!”

Yang Lin nodded slightly, “The Ku Clan has a divine treasure. It was left behind by that ancient cultivator. The reason the Ku Clan has been able to survive from the ancient times is because of that divine treasure. Besides that, it has some unique cultivation methods. For example, soul cultivation. Even though some members of the other clans cultivate their souls too, it’s far inferior to the Ku Clan! In short, the Ku Clan is very complicated and powerful.”

He gazed at Yang Ye and continued, “Is the Soul Nurturing Tree really not in your possession?”

Yang Ye immediately shook his head, “It isn’t!” What a joke! He would absolutely not admit it. After all, the potential troubles from admitting it would be utterly endless!

Yang Lin gazed at Yang Ye for a long time and nodded, “Be careful. Because the Ku Clan will clearly not let the matter rest. Understand?”

Yang Ye nodded slightly, “I will.”

Yang Lin flicked a black fruit over to Yang Ye. The fruit was around the size of a fist, completely pitch black, and quite scary looking.

Meanwhile, Yang Lin said, “This fruit carries an aura of evil, and it impacts the soul and mind of the user. However, I’ve eliminated that aura, so it won’t affect you.”

Yang Ye took the fruit and asked, “It can improve my body?”

Yang Lin nodded, “Actually, it’s equivalent to a Half-Step True Rank treasure. It isn’t just able to improve your body, it’ll stimulate your soul and mind as well. However, it’ll be very painful. So, you have to be mentally prepared.”

Pain? Yang Ye smiled. He didn’t fear pain at all. He took the fruit and said, “Thank you, Senior.”

Yang Lin glanced at Yang Ye and wanted to say something, but he didn’t say anything in the end. He just fell silent for a moment before he said, “Come, let’s return to the clan.” He waved his right hand, and the three of them vanished on the spot.

Around 15 minutes after they vanished, Ku Yuxing and the others appeared here.

Ku Yuxing gazed at Ku Ming, “Did you hear that?”

Ku Ming fell silent for a moment and replied, “He said that he doesn’t have it.”

Ku Yuxing’s eyes narrowed slightly. Meanwhile, the old man in a luxurious robe said, “I think he has it.”

Ku Yuxing replied, “I think he has it too.”

Ku Ming gazed at Ku Yuxing, “Why?”

Ku Yuxing replied, “If it was an ordinary person or even a True Realm expert, it would be impossible to conceal the aura of the Soul Energy emanated by the Soul Nurturing Tree. However, after the aura of Soul Energy vanished once they chased it to him.”

He paused for a moment and continued, “Did all of you notice? Our divine sense isn’t able to detect his aura at all! If I’m not wrong, he has a special technique that can conceal the aura of things.”

A cold glow flashed through Ku Ming’s eyes, “Why didn’t you let us kill him?”

Ku Yuxing shook his head, “While my Ku Clan isn’t afraid of the Yang Clan, it isn’t necessary to go head-on against them. Don’t go looking for trouble from him in secret as well. Your most important task is to protect that secret realm and stop outsiders from finding out about it. As for Yang Ye…”

A cold glow flashed through his eyes as he continued, “No one can take what belongs to my Ku Clan.”

…

Phecda City.

Once he returned to Phecda City, Yang Ye returned to his room and entered the Primordial Pagoda.

Yang Ye found Snowy on the 1st level of the Primordial Pagoda. She was holding a wooden sword in her claws, and the Soul Nurturing Tree was in front of her. Snowy was conversing with the Soul Nurturing Tree.

Yang Ye glanced at her. Obviously, it was Snowy who’d told the Soul Nurturing Tree what to do, and Yang Ye wondered why Snowy had done so.

Suddenly, the tree shook, and then it went over to Little Sky. After that, strand after strand of Soul Energy emerged from it and entered Little Sky’s body.

As for Snowy, she was staring at Little Sky while anticipation filled her eyes.

Yang Ye instantly understood why Snowy had made the Soul Nurturing Tree run off with them.

It was for Little Sky!

As the Soul Nurturing Tree ceaselessly sent Soul Energy into Little Sky, her soul gradually solidified. Yang Ye heaved a sigh of relief when he witnessed this. Sure enough, the Soul Nurturing Tree could save Little Sky.

Around an hour later, Little Sky’s eyes opened slowly.

Yang Ye quickly went over to her side, “Are you alright?”

Little Sky cracked a smile and said, “I probably won’t die.”

Yang Ye grinned, “You won’t. You won’t die while I’m here.”

Suddenly, Snowy flew over to Yang Ye, and then she hung on his chest and started crying. As she cried, she rubbed her head against Yang Ye’s chest, and it didn’t take long for all of them to be enveloped within white mist.
