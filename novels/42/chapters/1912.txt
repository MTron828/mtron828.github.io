Chapter 1913 – Wait a Moment! Let Me Kill Someone!

Two men and a woman appeared behind them.

All three of those people seemed quite strange. Their figures flickered between being material and ethereal, and they didn’t give off the slightest fluctuations of energy. So, even Yang Ye wasn’t able to notice their presence.

They were led by the man in a pure white robe. He looked very young and just a little over 20. His hair was extremely long and reached his waist, but it was tied into a bunch, so it wasn’t messy at all.

Besides that, the man emanated a holy and pure aura.

The man gazed at Yang Ye and grinned, “Brother, thank you for leading the way. Now, you can leave.”

Yang Ye chuckled. He was about to speak when Nansi Yin suddenly asked, “You’re Baili Xian?

A wisp of surprise flashed through his eyes, and he gazed at Nansi Yin, “You know my name!”

Nansi Yin’s face was solemn when she saw him admit it. She gazed at Yang Ye, “Baili Xian, one of the 6 Greats of the human race. In the younger generation of the human race, there’s 1 King, 2 Emperors, 3 Saints, 6 Greats. They represent the younger generation of the human race.”

She paused for a moment and placed emphasis on what she said next, “He’s very strong. He’s absolutely not someone an ordinary Enlightened Realm expert can be compared to!”

Baili Xian chuckled, “I didn’t expect you to know that much. It seems like your identity isn’t ordinary at all, so I’m sure you know how to act given the current situation. So will you leave yourselves, or should I send you off?”

He emphasized on the word ‘off’.

Nansi Yin turned to gaze at Yang Ye, but Yang Ye suddenly started laughing.

Nansi Yin was stunned.

Yang Ye smiled, “Do you know what I represent where I come from?”

Nansi Yin asked without giving it any thought, “What?”

Yang Ye replied, “I represent two words, never offend!”

Nansi Yin was stunned speechless.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye continued, “As far as I’m concerned, so-called geniuses are meant to be trampled on!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he started walking in Baili Xian’s group’s direction.

Nansi Yin stared at his figure, and there was a strange color in her eyes.

Confidence!

Since she met Yang Ye, he noticed that Yang Ye was very confident. Regardless of who he faced, Yang Ye was still very confident, and this confidence moved her!

She’d only seen one other person who was that confident, and it was her father whom she looked up to. Her father who’d raised up the Nansi Clan on his own and raised it to its current status.

Yang Ye was walking towards Baili Xian’s group. Suddenly, the other man by Baili Xian’s side stepped forward.

The man didn’t say a word. A red gourd appeared in his grasp, and then red mist surged out from it and shot towards Yang Ye like a vicious dragon.

Nansi Yin exclaimed, “It’s poisonous!”

However, Yang Ye didn’t stop, and it only took a moment for the red mist to envelop Yang Ye.

Nansi Yin’s expression changed drastically!

Om!

Suddenly, a sword howl resounded, and then a ray of light tore open the red mist. A figure appeared before the man, and then a sword shot down at him.

Heavenrend!

70 overlapped Heavenrends!

Even though it wasn’t enhanced by the Sword Domain, it was still capable of obliterating the world around it.

An expert’s skill was obvious once an expert took action.

Yang Ye’s attack made Baili Xian and the others’ expressions change. Especially the man in front of Yang Ye. At this moment, his pupils had constricted, and it was obvious how shocked he was by Yang Ye’s attack!

It was swift and impossible to dodge!

bang!

The man was blasted over 10km away.

As soon as he stopped himself, he spat out a few mouthfuls of blood, and his entire body started trembling.

That attack had injured his internal organs!

Yang Ye glanced at the man’s chest. There was a mirror-like object there, and most of the force from his attack had been endured by the mirror.

Yang Ye didn’t stop and intended to attack again. Suddenly, a black shadow swept towards him. It was extremely swift, and it arrived in front of him before he could react.

Yang Ye raised his sword and swung it.

Bang!

An explosion resounded, and the black shadow was blasted away.

Yang Ye looked over, and he noticed that the black shadow had been a whip. The whip was wielded by the woman by Baili Xian’s side. Yang Ye sized up the woman and smiled, “I thought all of you would fight me one on one!”

She waved her whip lightly, and then it shot towards Yang Ye like a venomous snake.

Meanwhile, a ray of light sliced through the air.

Hiss!

The whip was instantly sliced into two, and then it arrived before the woman. Meanwhile, a dagger appeared in her grasp, and then cold light flashed. Yang Ye’s sword energy was sliced into bits.

However, Yang Ye was in front of her now, and then his sword descended.

Bang!

The woman was instantly blasted 10km away, and her right arm instantly fell off her shoulder once she stopped herself.

Blood sprayed from there!

Yang Ye lowered his sword and gazed at Baili Xian who’d been silent until now, “It’s your turn!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye waved his sword.

Baili Xian stretched out his right hand and shook it slightly. In an instant, Yang Ye’s sword energy vanished without a trace.

Baili Xian gazed at Yang Ye, “I underestimated you a little. I’ll give you one last chance. Fuck off right now and I’ll let you live!”

He didn’t want to let YYY live, but he didn’t want to waste his strength here either. His opponents hadn’t shown themselves yet!

“We can’t let him leave!” Suddenly, the woman said, “He has that white pet which can find treasures. That little animal is useful to us. We must…”

Suddenly, Yang Ye gazed at her, “Little animal?”

Nansi Yin’s eyelids twitched when she saw Yang Ye’s reaction. That fellow is angry.

The woman’s heart trembled when Yang Ye gazed at her. She was about to speak when Yang Ye suddenly vanished on the spot.

The woman’s expression changed drastically!

At the moment Yang Ye vanished, Baili Xian had vanished as well.

Bang!

An explosion resounded, and then Baili Xian was blasted back to where he’d come from. Moreover, there was a bloody mark on his palm. As for Yang Ye, he’d appeared before the woman.

The woman would naturally not just wait for death to arrive, and she waved her dagger at him.

It was swift, precise, and powerful!

However, Yang Ye was even swifter, precise, and powerful!

A ray of light flashed!

Hiss!

A beautiful head flew up into the air.

Baili Xian’s face instantly became gloomy, “You’re courting death!”

He slammed his palm at Yang Ye.

Bang!

The space around Yang Ye shook violently, and then Yang Ye was blasted 300m back by a wave of mysterious energy. However, as soon as he stopped himself, Yang Ye stomped his right foot down and transformed into a ray of light that shot towards Baili Xian.

Ferocity flashed through Baili Xian’s eyes. He raised his right hand slowly before slamming it down.

At this moment, the space before him seemed like it was being compressed, and a huge spatial palm appeared there.

As for Yang Ye, he’d returned to where he’d been a moment ago! The energy had blasted him back!

Yang Ye glanced at his chest. There was a palm print there. It had traveled through space and struck him.

It was very strange!

If his body wasn’t extremely strong, it would have heavily injured him! DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“Die!” Baili Xian suddenly took a step forward, and then he slammed his palm at Yang Ye from afar. Yang Ye moved sideways and barely dodged it. Meanwhile, a spatial palm appeared where he’d been just a moment ago.

Yang Ye pondered deeply for a moment, and then he appeared before Baili Xian and stabbed his sword forward.

Baili Xian didn’t dodge and slapped his palm forward.

Obviously, he was confident in his own strength.

As soon as their attacks came into contact with each other, the space around them trembled violently. Suddenly, 10 ethereal swords appeared around Baili Xian, and then rays of light crisscrossed and enveloped both of them!

Bang!

Suddenly, a ray of powerful light surged out from within the sword energy. In an instant, all the sword energy was obliterated, and a figure was blasted away. It was Yang Ye.

As soon as he stopped himself, Yang Ye looked up towards the distance. Baili Xian had a few dozen injuries on him, but there was a golden circle of light above him.

It was that golden light which had blasted him back!

An endless supply of trump cards!

Baili Xian stared at Yang Ye, “Who the hell are you?!”

Yang Ye cracked a smile, “Go figure!”

Viciousness flashed through Baili Xian’s eyes, and then he transformed into a ray of golden light that shot towards Yang Ye.

The golden light were thin like the hairs on an ox!

It was created by extreme speed!

Even Yang Ye hadn’t been able to react before they struck him.

Bang!

Yang Ye was blasted far away by the force within it!

Nansi Yin was stunned, and then she slowly clenched her right fist while a fire lotus brand appeared on her forehead. However, the fire lotus brand vanished just a moment later. She looked towards Yang Ye while disbelief filled her eyes!

Because Yang Ye was completely fine! He wasn’t completely unharmed because at the very least, his face was pale. But besides that, there were no other injuries on him!

Baili Xian’s expression was extremely unsightly. He hadn’t expected Yang Ye’s physical body to be that strong!

It wasn’t just strong, it was simply terrifying!

Yang Ye patted his chest lightly and started walking slowly in Baili Xian’s direction. He was about to attack again when a voice suddenly resounded from within the mountain, “All of you come in!”

All of them were stunned, and then Baili Xian and the other man were visibly happy!

Fortune!

Absolute fortune!

However, Yang Ye suddenly said, “Wait a moment! Let me kill someone!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye transformed into a ray of light and shot forward.
