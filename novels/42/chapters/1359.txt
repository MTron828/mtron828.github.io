Chapter 1360 – Fight Both Man And The Heavens!

The Void Cloud Shuttle sped up under Yang Ye’s orders and entered the teleportation formation.

As soon as it did, a mysterious force enveloped them, and then a spatial passageway that seemed as if it was made of stars appeared before them. It didn’t take long for a ray of dazzling starlight to erupt from the passageway, and then it enveloped them before the scene before their eyes started to blur.

It was because they were moving too swiftly!

After an unknown amount of time passed, Yang Ye opened his eyes slowly. At this moment, he was on a huge stone platform that stretched out for around 3km in all directions. A huge stellar teleportation formation was in the air above the stone platform, and they’d emerged from that exact formation.

There were countless similar stone platforms all around them. Yang Ye took a quick glance and noticed that there were at least a few tens of thousands of them!

Meanwhile, Ye Liuyun suddenly said, “Look up!”

Yang Ye looked up and saw a dense expanse of stars covering the sky above them. It wasn’t just there, even their surroundings were filled with stars. But those stars were quite far away from them.

“No wonder it’s called Stellar City!” Ye Liuyun continued, “This isn’t a star at all. It’s a city that was built in space.”

Yang Ye nodded while a trace of seriousness could be seen in his eyes. Blind Maiden had said that Stellar City was created by a clan in the large world. He didn’t have an idea of what such a clan was like, but now that he’d seen this city, he knew that it was definitely extremely terrifying.

After all, was it not terrifying to be able to build a city in outer space?

In any case, he couldn’t accomplish that!

Suddenly, the space before them rippled, and it didn’t take long for a man in black armor to appear before Yang Ye’s group. The man glanced indifferently at them and said, “The teleportation fees are 500 divine crystals!”

“Divine crystals?” Yang Ye was slightly stunned. He only knew energy stones and violet crystals. He’d never heard of divine crystals.

The man glanced at Yang Ye and asked, “Is it your first time here?”

Yang Ye nodded.

The man said, “One divine crystal is equivalent to 100 violet crystals, so you can pay with 50,000 violet crystals as well!”

50,000 violet crystals!

Ye Liuyun and the others felt shocked. After all, it wasn’t a small number. Even though it wasn’t a huge amount to the Sword Alliance, they felt that it was quite expensive just for a single teleportation.

Ye Liuyun and the others weren’t the only ones to feel shocked, even Yang Ye was quite surprised. Isn’t that a little too much?

Meanwhile, the man said, “Only my Situ Clan is capable of providing stellar teleportation in this universe.”

A monopoly! Yang Ye had immediately thought of this when he heard the man. No wonder it’s so expensive. So only they can accomplish this.

Yang Ye didn’t hesitate to flick a spatial ring over. He could afford to pay 50,000 violet crystals. After all, he had almost 1.3 million violet crystals right now!

All of them had been created by Snowy!

Yang Ye couldn’t help but slowly clench his fists when he thought of Snowy.

Damn you! Mo Xiaoleng! A wisp of ghastly killing intent flashed through Yang Ye’s eyes. He’d been careless that day. He hadn’t expected Mo Xiaoleng to summon an expert from her clan to capture Zi’er and Snowy! If he knew that would happen, he would have stopped at nothing to kill Mop Xiaoleng before that happened!

The man glanced at the spatial ring and nodded, and he was about to leave when Ye Liuyun suddenly spoke, “Please wait a moment.”

The man stopped and gazed at her.

She flicked a spatial ring over to the man. The man glanced at it, and he noticed 10,000 violet crystals within it. 10,000 violet crystals were equivalent to 100 divine crystals, and that was equivalent to a month of his wages. So, he didn’t hesitate to take it, and then he gazed at Ye Liuyun, “I’m Li Shi, and I’m in charge of this teleportation formation.”

Ye Liuyun smiled when she saw him take the spatial ring, and she said, “Brother Li, we’ve new here, and we don’t know much. Please enlighten us.”

Li Shi asked, “What do you want to know?”

Ye Liuyun pondered deeply for a moment before she said, “Why don’t you tell us what we should know?”

Li Shi glanced at Ye Liuyun and said, “This is the Shi Clan’s territory. Even though it’s at the large world, don’t offend the Shi Clan here. Besides that, while it’s the Shi Clan’s territory, the forces of many other powers from the large world are here as well. Because this is the interchange between all the medium and small worlds. In short, the situation here is very complicated, so it’s best to act cautiously!” Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Ye Liuyun nodded slightly and said, “We want to head to the Radiant Dimension. Do we teleport there from here?”

Li Shi shook his head and answered her, “The teleportation formations here are one-way. If you want to travel to other worlds, you have to head to the teleportation platform at the north of the city. There are teleportation formations to countless worlds there. So long as you pay the fees and provide the name or coordinates of your destination, you’ll be teleported there! However, you can’t teleport to other worlds right now.”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Why?”

Li Shi replied, “Not long ago, someone seemed to have drawn upon the energy of countless stars, and it affected our teleportation formations. They are being repaired right now, but it probably won’t take long.”

Drew upon the energy of countless stars? The corners of Yang Ye’s mouth twitched. Am I the cause?

Meanwhile, Li Shi said, “You can rest in Divine Sky Pavilion within the city. Right, the Azure Cloud Merchant Group is holding an auction tonight. It’s the biggest and best merchant group in the city, and all the items in their previous auctions have been pretty good. Supposedly, there are even treasures above the Void Rank, the Origin Rank, being auctioned off this time. If you have enough funds, you can try to bid for the Origin Rank treasures!”

Ye Liuyun suddenly asked, “Does Azure Cloud Merchant Group belong to the Shi Clan?”

Li Shi shook his head, “No. Anyone can open stores in the city by paying rental to the Shi Clan. Right, even though I don’t know which world Azure Cloud Merchant Group is from, they are quite strong. So, you absolutely shouldn’t think about targeting them. Actually, I should say that anyone capable of opening a store in this city is strong.”

“Understood!” Ye Liuyun nodded slightly, and then she fell into deep thought. No one knew what she was thinking.

Li Shi glanced at them and said, “If there’s nothing else that you need, then I’ll be leaving now.”

Yang Ye smiled, “Thank you!”

“It was my duty!” As soon as he finished speaking, he cupped his fist to Yang Ye and the others, and then he vanished on the spot.

Yang Ye turned to look at Ye Liuyun, and he asked, “What are you thinking about now?”

Ye Liuyun replied, “This is the place where all words meet. In other words, this place is linked to countless worlds. So, we must establish ourselves here. Of course, it’s not for the sake of earning violet crystals, and it’s for the sake of possessing information related to countless worlds at all times.”

Yang Ye nodded, “That’s a very good idea. Do it and feel free to tell me if you need anything or encounter any problems.”

Ye Liuyun nodded, “There’s no rush now. I’ll make arrangements once I gain an understanding of this place. Come, let’s go to that Divine Sky Pavilion which he told us about.”

It didn’t take long for them to arrive before Divine Sky Pavilion. Yang Ye was quite wealthy and booked an entire floor.

...

In his room. Yang Ye entered the 3rd level of the Primordial Pagoda and started cultivating. Only a day would pass in the outside world while he cultivated for 10 days in there. With such a heaven defying room to cultivate in, Yang Ye naturally had to cultivate diligently and not waste even a breath of time!

Actually, he anticipated the 4th level even more. The Primordial Pagoda had 9 levels, and every single one of them had given him extremely pleasant surprises. Especially the 3rd level. It was an absolutely heaven defying tool for cultivating. If just the 3rd level was so heaven defying, then what about the 4th? Moreover, the Divine Yin Flame had told him to access the 4th level before going to see it.

If he could gain control over the Divine Yin Flame....

Just thinking about it made Yang Ye quite excited!

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts, focused, and started to concentrate on cultivating.

6 hours later, Yang Ye suddenly opened his eyes and returned to the outside world.

Yang Ye said, “Come in!”

The door was pushed open and Ye Liuyun walked in.

She asked, “Are you interested in taking a look at that auction?”

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and nodded, “Let’s go have a look!”

Stellar City was exceptionally gorgeous at night. Stars would fill one’s field of vision upon looking up. Especially these stars in space. They seemed like they were just hanging above them and were within reach.

Yang Ye gazed at the stars that covered the sky above them and said, “Actually, it’s really not bad to live such a peaceful life with someone you love!”

Ye Liuyun glanced at him and said, “From the moment we became cultivators, it meant that we have to fight both man and the heavens. The path of cultivation is endless. That represents that we might have to fight others and the heavens forever. It can’t be helped because you’ll die if you refuse to fight!”

Yang Ye smiled, “I was just expressing my feelings!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye sped up.

Ye Liuyun glanced at him and hurried off after him.

It didn’t take long for them to arrive at Azure Cloud Merchant Group. They paid 10 divine crystals to enter the auction house. But the auction had already begun.

Yang Ye and Ye Liuyun found an empty room. Every single room was very far away from each other, and the distance between them was around 30m. Moreover, they were protected by formations. Once they entered the room, they were completely isolated from the outside world, and the divine sense of others couldn’t enter at all.

There was a huge stone platform at the center of the auction house, and there was a woman in a green dress standing on it. The woman was beautiful, and she had a warm smile on her face.

She glanced at the surroundings and said, “The next item to be auctioned is a slave! Let’s skip the introductions and take a look at the goods first.” She clapped lightly while she spoke.

It didn’t take long for the teleportation on her right to light up abruptly, and then a figure appeared on the stone platform.

Yang Ye suddenly stood up when he saw that person, and his eyes were filled with disbelief.
