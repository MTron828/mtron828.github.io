Chapter 1557 - Imprisoned!

Translator: InVader

Yang Ye started cultivating like a madman.

This place was a paradise of cultivation indeed, and he didn’t want to waste this opportunity.

Little Sky Flame was madly absorbing the pure fire element energy here as well. This place was a true paradise for her.

However, Yang Ye didn’t let her continue forever. Because he would be in big trouble if he allowed her to continue.

After cultivating for ten days, Yang Ye snuck out of his cultivation room.

He hadn’t forgotten his true objective!

There were only two ways to find out where Zi’er and Snowy were. The first was to find Mo Xiaoleng, and the second was to capture a higher-up of the Divine Phoenix Clan. However, both of them weren’t easy tasks.

Yang Ye had just left the room when Little Sky Flame emerged once more, and then she pointed downwards. Obviously, she was telling him to go down.

Yang Ye shook his head, “You can’t absorb more right now. I have other things to do. Absorb more energy later, alright?”

She shook her head and started waving her hands.

It didn’t take long for Yang Ye to frown. Because she wasn’t the one asking him to head down there, it was the Divine Yin Flame.

The Divine Ying Flame wanted him to go down there!

Yang Ye remained silent for a moment, and then he asked, “Why?”

Little Sky Flame entered the Primordial Pagoda, and it didn’t take long for her to emerge once more. After that she pointed down again. Besides that, she didn’t provide any further explanation.

The corners of Yang Ye’s mouth twitched slightly because the Divine Yin Flame hadn’t given him an answer and just wanted him to go down there.

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment, and then he nodded. Even though he didn’t know why it wanted him to go down there, he knew that it wouldn’t harm him. Moreover, he was very curious as well. After all, there was something down below that could even draw the attention of the Divine Yin Flame.

Yang Ye didn’t know what level the Divine Ying Flame was at, but he was very well aware that something that caught its attention would definitely not be ordinary.

Not long after he went further underground, Yang Ye entered a world of lava.

It was extremely hot here. Fortunately, his body could handle the heat here.

Around two hours later, Yang Ye stopped moving. Because the temperature around him was at the limits of his body. Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings, but he only saw lava all around him.

He remained silent on the spot for a moment, and then he released his sword intent around himself and continued his descent.

Around two more hours passed before Yang Ye stopped once more. Because even his sword intent couldn’t endure the temperature here.

Suddenly, Little Sky Flame emerged from within him, and then a ball of fire enveloped Yang Ye. As soon as the ball of fire wrapped around him, Yang Ye noticed that the lava around him actually started moving away. The lava seemed to fear the barrier of fire around him.

Yang Ye gazed at Little Sky Flame. She smiled brilliantly at him when she saw him look over at her.

Yang Ye grinned and rubbed her head. He noticed that she was much stronger than he’d expected! However, it made sense because she’d been molded by the Divine Yin Flame.

Yang Ye continued to descend further. Around four hours later, Yang Ye stopped once more.

Yang Ye saw many ghastly white balls of fire not too far away from him. They were only the size of a thumb, but there were many of them. Over 100 of them.

Little Sky Flame’s eyes instantly lit up when she saw those balls of fire. She immediately flew over to them, grabbed one, and brought it to her mouth.

Yang Ye was quite puzzled to see the ball of fire show no signs of fighting back. When he sized them up carefully, he noticed that the fire element energy they contained was extraordinarily pure, and every time she consumed one of them, Little Sky Flame’s aura would grow slightly stronger.

At this moment, Yang Ye understood why the Divine Yin Flame had sent him down here.

The Divine Yin Flame had actually sent him down here for Little Sky Flame’s sake.

Suddenly, Little Sky appeared in front of Yang Ye.

Yang Ye was stunned by this and asked, “What are you doing out here?”

Meanwhile, Little Sky waved her hand at Little Sky Flame. The latter glanced reluctantly at the balls of fire, and then she flew over to Little Sky.

Little Sky stretched out her hand and rubbed Little Sky Flame’s head, “Don’t consume them, alright?”

Little Sky Flame bit her finger while a conflicted expression could be seen in her eyes.

Yang Ye asked, “Why?”

A wisp of anger flashed through Little Sky’s eyes, “They are young flames!”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “What do you mean?”

She explained, “Young flames are tiny balls of flames in the world that have a chance to evolve into fire element Sprite Kings. All of them might evolve into fire element Sprite Kings in the future.”

Yang Ye was absolutely shocked. After all, there were over 100 balls of flames here!

What was it like to have over 100 fire element Sprite Kings?

Meanwhile, Little Sky suddenly spoke coldly, “Do you know why they aren’t fighting back? Because they’d been imprisoned. If I’m not wrong, the Divine Phoenix Clan imprisoned them here and are using the pure fire element energy here to foster them. Once they grow to a certain extent, they’ll be ready for the Divine Phoenix Clan’s consumption. How dare they!”

Yang Ye’s eyelids twitched because Little Sky was angry again. She was completely harmless when she wasn’t angry, but once she did get angry, she was extremely terrifying. After all, she summoned over 100 Eyes of the Heaven Dao when she got angry that day.

Actually, Yang Ye was quite shocked by the fact that the Divine Phoenix Clan had imprisoned over 100 young flames. After all, there was another formidable power in this world.

The Sprite Palace!

If the sprites in the Sprite Palace found out that the Divine Phoenix Clan had imprisoned so many young flames, the Sprite Palace would definitely not let the matter rest.

Yang Ye had thought about going to the Sprite Palace because the Divine Phoenix Clan had captured Snowy. However, he’d rejected that thought in the end. Because the Sprite Palace would definitely not believe him. So, he had to rely on himself!

Meanwhile, Little Sky rubbed Little Sky Flame’s head and spoke softly, “Sprites are born from the world, and both you and all of them are the same. So, don’t kill each other, alright?”

Even though Little Sky Flame was quite reluctant, she still nodded. Actually, she didn’t really understand Little Sky. She only knew that Little Sky didn’t want her to consume them. Since Little Sky didn’t want her to do that, then she wouldn’t.

Little Sky looked up at those balls of flames and said, “I want to take them into Little Sky Continent.”

Yang Ye was slightly stunned, “You want to save them?”

Little Sky nodded, “Little Sky Continent is very special. Even though it doesn’t contain pure fire element energy, it has a better form of energy than that. So, they’ll definitely be able to rapidly evolve into Sprite Kings once they go in there.”

Yang Ye’s eyes lit up when he heard this. After all, that would be over 100 Sprite Kings!

Yang Ye didn’t hesitate to nod, “Alright, take them in there.” But as soon as he spoke up to this point, he seemed to have thought of something and said, “Let’s wait for now. We’re in the Divine Phoenix Clan’s territory, so if we take all of them, it may alarm the experts of the Divine Phoenix Clan!”

He’d only been able to get here because of the Sword Domain. The Sword Domain had helped him fully conceal his aura. So, unless a Rebirth Realm expert scanned the area intentionally to find him, it would be impossible to find him. But if Little Sky took those young flames, it would definitely alarm the experts of the Divine Phoenix Clan.

“Don’t worry!” Little Sky shook her head, “They won’t notice anything.” As she spoke, she took a step forward, and then Yang Ye noticed that something in the surroundings seemed to have changed. However, he couldn’t put his finger on it.

Meanwhile, Little Sky waved her hand. In an instant, the young flames entered Yang Ye’s body in succession. Around 10 breaths of time later, all of them had entered Yang Ye’s body.

Little Sky was about to enter the Primordial Pagoda as well, but Yang Ye stopped her.

Yang Ye spoke solemnly, “Little Sky, help me find two people. No, one of them is a demon, and the other is a Sprite Lord!” It was definitely absolutely difficult for him to find Zi’er and Snowy on his own. So, he had no choice but to seek her help.

“A Sprite Lord?” Little Sky’s eyes opened wide, “You know the Sprite Lord?”

Yang Ye nodded and said, “They were taken by the Divine Phoenix Clan. I don’t know where they are, so help me find them!”

“The Sprite Lord!” Little Sky nodded slightly and said, “I’ll definitely be able to find her if she’s in the Phoenix Domain.”

Yang Ye was puzzled by this, “Why?”

She chuckled, “Firstly, her identity is special. Secondly… I’m not telling you the second reason. Hehehe…”

She slowly closed her eyes.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

A long time passed before Little Sky frowned, and then she opened her eyes slowly. She said, “I found the Sprite Lord you spoke about.”

Yang Ye hurriedly asked, “Where?”

Little Sky pointed downwards, “Further down!”

“Let’s go!” Yang Ye was about to descend further once he finished speaking, but Little Sky suddenly grabbed him and said, “Don’t be rash no matter what you see, alright?”

Yang Ye turned to look at Little Sky, “What are you trying to say?!”

Little Sky was about to speak when Yang Ye turned around and vanished.

Little Sky sighed softly, “Damn you! Divine Phoenix Clan!”

As soon as she finished speaking, she hurriedly went after him.

Around 15 minutes later, Yang Ye stopped.

After so long, he finally saw Snowy again. There was a small golden cage not too far ahead from him, and Snowy was within that cage.

At this moment, Snowy was lying there silently. Her eyes were closed, and she seemed like she was sleeping.

The spirit energy in the surroundings was extremely abundant, and it was at least ten times denser than the cultivation room that Yang Ye had cultivated in earlier. Because countless strands of spirit energy were ceaselessly seeping out of Snowy.

Little Sky frowned when she saw Snowy, “They imprisoned the Sprite Lord and made it ceaselessly give out its quintessence spirit energy. This… this is no different than killing the goose that lays the golden eggs!”

Yang Ye paid no attention to Little Sky. He just walked over to Snowy. As he gazed at Snowy’s imprisoned figure, his hands started to tremble, “Sno… Snowy…”

There was no response.

Yang Ye turned to look at Little Sky. The latter remained silent for a while, and then she said, “She may not be able to wake up again!”

Yang Ye’s pupils constricted, “Why?”

Little Sky spoke solemnly, “Because her consciousness has been extracted. It’s like extracting the soul of a human. Presently, she doesn’t have her soul, and only her quintessence spirit energy remains. Moreover, the Divine Phoenix Clan is releasing the quintessence spirit energy within her. Once all that spirit energy is completely released, the Phoenix Domain will become a true paradise of cultivation.”

Little Sky paused for a moment and continued, “Cultivating here will be a few dozen times faster than cultivating in the outside world. Moreover, the Dualism Realm phoenixes of the Divine Phoenix Clan can rely on her quintessence spirit energy to charge into the Rebirth Realm. Perhaps they won’t gain many more Rebirth Realm experts from this, but they’ll definitely gain numerous Deities and Dualism Realm experts. In short, the Divine Phoenix Clan’s overall strength will rise by many levels.”

Yang Ye slowly closed his eyes. A long time passed before he turned around to look at Snowy. He placed his trembling hands on the cage, and pain filled his eyes, “I… I…” RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Meanwhile, Little Sky frowned, “We’ve been made.”

“DIVINE PHOENIX CLAN!” Suddenly, a hysterical and furious howl rumbled from deep beneath the ground. It shot up extremely swiftly, and it only took an instant for it to arrive above ground and rumble like a thunderclap throughout the surroundings.

At this moment, the entire Divine Phoenix Clan was startled!
