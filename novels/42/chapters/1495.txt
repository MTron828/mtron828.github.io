Chapter 1496 - A Battle To The Death!

Translator: InVader

The Rebirth Sword!

At this moment, Yang Ye had executed the Rebirth Sword!

Yang Ye was very well aware that the old man’s strength far surpassed his own. So, he would only be making a fool of himself if he used an ordinary attack. Thus, he’d immediately executed the Rebirth Sword which he’d just mastered.

The reason his attack could crack space apart was that he’d enhanced it with Quasi Returnal Rank sword intent and slaughter intent. The two intents had caused its might to multiply numerous times.

When the old man recovered from his shock and gazed at Yang Ye, the sword in Yang Ye’s grasp had vanished.

Bang!

A loud explosion resounded in front of the old man, and then Lian Banzhuang watched with shock as the old man was blasted around 10km away.

Once the old man stopped himself, he stretched open his palm, and there was a sword at the center of it. The sword had stabbed through the old man’s palm, and it wasn’t sitting still there. It was still spinning at high speeds. Moreover, it was moving forward, inch by inch, into the old man’s palm. It didn’t take long for the sword to shoot through the old man’s palm.

A string of blood sprayed from the old man’s right shoulder!

The Sword Precursor had the Sword Spirit within it, so it instantly transformed into a ray of light that flew back into Yang Ye’s grasp.

A moment of silence ensued, and then a wisp of blood flowed out from the corner of the old man’s mouth. Even though the attack had merely pierced through the old man’s palm and shoulder, the force within the sword had instantly shot through the old man’s entire body when it came into contact with his palm. So, it hadn’t just injured the old man’s palm and shoulder, it had even injured him internally!

The old man gazed at Yang Ye, “Truly unbelievable. I was actually injured by a Semi-Deity.”

Yang Ye glanced at his sword and said, “Unfortunately, I wasn’t able to kill you. Since you’re alive, I’ll have to suffer now.”

“Kill me?” The old man was stunned, and then he shook his head and chuckled, “How laughable! A Semi-Deity actually wants to kill me? How absurd. I…”

The old man was about to speak when Yang Ye suddenly closed his eyes. A moment later, Yang Ye’s sword vanished once more!

The old man’s expression changed, and he swiftly slapped his left palm forward. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Bang!

An explosion resounded before the old man was blasted away once more!

This time, a hole appeared in the old man’s left palm, and it went all the way through his left shoulder. At this moment, both of the old man’s palms and shoulders were bleeding.

Yang Ye shook his head. What a pity.

Two attacks!

Once he attained the Semi-Deity Realm, the volume of profound energy he possessed was sufficient to execute the Rebirth Sword twice. He’d intentionally launched a surprise attack while talking just now. Unfortunately, the old man’s reaction speed was too swift. So, the sword which was aimed at the old man’s heart had been stopped by the old man’s left palm.

Now, he didn’t have the strength to execute the Rebirth Sword again!

The old man glanced at his left palm, and then he looked up at Yang Ye, “You’ve really surprised me. Needless to say, I was blind this time. If it was an ordinary Dualism Realm expert in my place, then even if those two attacks of yours couldn’t kill that expert, it would heavily injure that expert. Unfortunately, I’m not at the Dualism Realm! Now, your profound energy has been exhausted. Do you have any other moves?”

Yang Ye flipped his palm and put both the ancient sheath and Sword Precursor away. After that, he stomped his right foot down, and the space below him instantly started trembling violently while his figure vanished on the spot. He was in front of the old man when his figure appeared once more, and he didn’t waste his breath and just slammed his fist at the old man!

A wisp of ridicule curled up on the corners of the old man’s mouth. He clenched his injured right fist and similarly slammed a punch at Yang Ye.

Boom!

As soon as their fists came into contact, an explosion resounded. At the same time, Yang Ye was blasted very far away. At the same time, Lian Banzhuang immediately appeared in front of the old man, and the multicolored ribbon in her right grasp swept down at the old man!

At the moment she swung the ribbon, it transformed into a pillar of multicolored light that instantly appeared above the old man.

A wisp of ferocity flashed through the old man’s eyes, and then a terrifying aura surged out explosively from within him!

Bang!

Lian Banzhuang’s ribbon was blasted into pieces while she herself was slammed over 3km away.

At the moment that Lian Banzhuang had been blasted away, Yang Ye suddenly appeared before the old man, and he slammed his fist forward again.

The old man refused to display any weakness, and he slammed his fist against Yang Ye’s fist.

Bang!

Yang Ye was instantly blasted over 3km away!

“Your strength isn’t bad!” Meanwhile, the old man suddenly spoke, “Unfortunately, it’s still too weak for me. It’s time to put an end to all of this. You…”

The old man stopped abruptly because Yang Ye had suddenly appeared in front of him again, and then another punch slammed down at him. At the same time, Lian Banzhuang charged at the old man.

“You’re courting death!” The old man clenched his right fist and slammed it forward.

Bang!

A loud explosion resounded. As expected, Yang Ye was blasted away again, and the impact even blasted away Lian Banzhuang’s approaching figure.

However, every single time he was blasted away, Yang Ye charged over to the old man again.

As the old man fought, he suddenly noticed that Yang Ye’s physical strength and defenses had actually far surpassed his expectations. It wasn’t just that, even Yang Ye’s recovery had far surpassed his expectations. As far as he was concerned, Yang Ye was definitely injured every single time he punched Yang Ye away. However, as the battle dragged on, he noticed that Yang Ye seemed to be completely unharmed!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye arrived in front of him again. Just like before, Yang Ye slammed his fist at the old man!

The old man subconsciously slammed his fist at Yang Ye.

There was a strange expression in Yang Ye’s eyes when he saw the old man’s fist approach him again.

Boom!

Crack!

As soon as their fists collided, something unexpected occurred. While Yang Ye was blasted away again, the old man’s entire arm was actually blasted away. At the same time, the powerful force within Yang Ye’s punch pushed the old man around 300m back!

Elemental Breaker!

It was the Elemental Breaker, of course. The reason Yang Ye hadn’t executed it right away was because he wanted to numb the old man to his attacks. He wanted the old man to put down his guard. Because the old man had been extremely vigilant in the beginning. If he’d executed the Elemental Breaker technique while the old man was vigilant, then it would have definitely been incapable of causing any material effect.

He could only take the old man by surprise with the Elemental Breaker technique if the old man had put down his guard. Sure enough, Yang Ye had succeeded.

He’d blasted off the old man’s arm with just one punch!

The old man had an extremely ferocious expression on his face right now, and he looked up at Yang Ye. Needless to say, he’d been tricked by the ant who stood before him.

It was an embarrassment!

A huge embarrassment!

Because he’d actually been repeatedly injured by a Semi-Deity!

“I’ll tear you into pieces!” As soon as he finished speaking, the old man transformed into a ray of light that shot towards Yang Ye. Everywhere he passed, even space started to warp.

Lian Banzhuang’s expression changed slightly from the sight of this, and she hurriedly said, “Watch out!”

Bang!

As soon as she finished speaking, Yang Ye was blasted away. However, it didn’t take long for him to stop. At this moment, there was a casket lid in his grasp!

Lian Banzhuang heaved a sigh of relief when she saw the casket lid. After all, the consequences would have been unimaginable if Yang Ye didn’t have that casket lid!

Lian Banzhuang wasn’t the only one who heaved a sigh of relief, Yang Ye had done the same. Fortunately, he had the casket lid. Otherwise, he would have been crippled even if he could escape death. Because even with the casket lid, he felt like his entire body had cracked open.

His body was at the Undying Realm, and he’d even cultivated the Undying Elemental Body. So, his body was even much stronger than the rock titans at Rock Mountain.

However, his body was still cracked open after he used the casket lid to protect himself!

Obviously, if he didn’t have the casket lid, then the old man’s full strength was very likely to have blasted Yang Ye into pieces!

Even though the old man had been suppressed to the Dualism Realm, his strength wasn’t something that a Dualism Realm expert could come close to! Lian Banzhuang was at the Dualism Realm too, but she was completely suppressed by the old man!

Perhaps the old man was inferior to Blood Maiden, but he was much stronger than Yang Ye and Lian Banzhuang!

Fortunately, Yang Ye had no intention to kill the old man. He only sought to keep the old man busy. So long as he succeeded in keeping the old man busy until Blood Maiden regained her consciousness, then his side would be victorious!

Yang Ye took a deep breath when he thought up to this point, and then he started to use the bit of profound energy he’d recovered to repair his body.

He had Energy Pearls, so he could restore all his profound energy in an instant, but it wasn’t the time to use it!

The old man’s gaze descended onto the shield Yang Ye was using. He hadn’t expected his lethal blow to be actually stopped by that casket lid!

Based on his current realm of cultivation, it wouldn’t be that easy to kill Yang Ye while Yang Ye had the casket lid!

Their plan was guaranteed success, yet now, a problem had appeared in their plan!

The old man glanced at Blood Maiden. He was very well aware that if she woke up, then not to mention killing her, even he would die here!

Suddenly, something unexpected occurred. The space above the old man suddenly shook slightly, and then a middle aged man with a spear in his grasp appeared above the old man.

The old man gazed at the middle aged man, and a wisp of surprise flashed through his eyes, “Yu Ming, what are you doing here?”

The middle aged man glanced at Blood Maiden and said, “The Oracle said that you will encounter problems here, so she told me to stop fighting for that treasure and come here immediately. As expected, you really are having some trouble. She still isn’t dead.”

Two Rebirth Realm experts!

Both Yang Ye and Lian Banzhuang’s face turned extremely unsightly.

Suddenly, Lian Banzhuang turned around and transformed into a ray of multicolored light that vanished into the sky!

She’d fled!

Yang Ye’s face grew even more unsightly!
