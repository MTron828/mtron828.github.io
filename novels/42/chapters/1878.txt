Chapter 1879 – Destroy This World!

A Sky Devil!

Yang Ye knew that a Sky Devil was here.

Suddenly, the scene before him changed.

Heaven Pillar Mountain!

The scene around him had transformed into the area around Heaven Pillar Mountain, and he was in the sea of clouds above it while an ocean of blood surged below him.

Yang Ye looked down. There was a fierce battle going on down there!

He was the person leading the battle! Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Nether Maiden, An Nanjing, and all the others were behind him, and he recognized the person he was fighting. It was the Sovereign of Man.

The Sovereign of Man!

The Sovereign of Man who was holding the holy sword!

How strong was he? Every single attack carried the might of the world. It didn’t seem like the might of a man. He and the others were no match for the Sovereign of Man… In the end, all of them died before his eyes.

However, the Yang Ye who stood high above in the sky wasn’t shaken by this at all!

An illusion!

He knew that it was an illusion created by the Sky Devil. However, a voice suddenly resounded in his mind, “Haha! You think this is an illusion?”

Yang Ye turned to look, and he saw a black robed man standing not too far away.

Meanwhile, the black robed man said, “We Sky Devils are from another world, and we possess a special ability. It allows us to get a glimpse of a person’s future. Unfortunately, we can’t see our own future!”

Yang Ye glanced at the black robed man, “You’re a little different from what I imagined!”

The black robed man replied, “As far as you humans are concerned, we Sky Devils are monsters that deceive the mind, right?”

Yang Ye nodded.

“Haha!” The black robed man chuckled, “No, we don’t deceive the minds of humans, and we just recreate what we’ve seen for you to see.”

Yang Ye asked, “And?”

The black robed man said, “And then they go mad, go wild, and die. In the end, we absorb their cultivation.”

Yang Ye said, “You’re quite frank.”

The black robed man replied, “I know you’re a sword cultivator, and you possess the Enlightened Sword Heart. But… Do you really think that everything you’ve seen is just an illusion? No, they aren’t illusions. Everything you saw will definitely happen one day!”

Yang Ye looked the black robed man in the eyes, “Perhaps what you said is true, but I think that the outcome isn’t the most important. The most important is the process. I don’t care what happens in the future, I only care about what happens now. If a person is always thinking about what’ll happen in the future, wouldn’t it be a truly tiring life?”

The black robed man fell silent.

Yang Ye looked down. The battle had come to an end. He, An Nanjing, and all the others were dead, of course.

Yang Ye shook his head and chuckled, “I think that I don’t need to temper my heart. I only have to stay true to it!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he waved his right hand and the surroundings turned ethereal.

It only took a moment for him to return to reality.

As for the black robed man, he was still beside Yang Ye.

Meanwhile, the black robed man said, “Your heart is clear as a mirror!”

Yang Ye said, “But someone said my heart is flawed!”

The black robed man shook his head, “The flaw you mentioned isn’t what you’re thinking about. There is no perfect being in this world. All beings have their strong points, and they definitely have their own flaws too. Your flaw isn’t your heart towards the sword, it’s that your heart towards the sword is an extreme and selfish one.”

Yang Ye replied, “But… that is me!”

The black robed man nodded, “You’re right, it is you. If you change it, then you may not be yourself anymore. Of course, if you change it, your attainments in the Sword Dao will definitely rise a level higher. However, refusing to change it doesn’t mean that your Sword Dao wouldn’t rise a level higher.”

Yang Ye shook his head, “That sounds quite complicated.”

The black robed man replied, “Just stay true to your heart!”

Yang Ye glanced at him and asked, “Why are you telling me all of this?”

The black robed man fell silent.

Yang Ye smiled, “Don’t tell me that the Sky Devils like to help people!”

The black robed man replied, “I can’t kill you. Since I can’t kill you, why not make a friend out of you? The strong are worth becoming friends with, right?”

Yang Ye glanced at the black robed man and nodded, “Indeed!”

Yang Ye would naturally not refuse the Sky Devil. Things are easier to accomplish when one has more help. Most importantly, it wasn’t necessary to make enemies everywhere. Regardless of whether it was Dark, the Ancient Emperor, or the Heavenly Saber Exalt, he naturally intended to become friends with them if it was possible.

“Nie Yan!” The black robed man said, “My human name.”

Yang Ye was about to speak when Nie Yan suddenly said, “I know you’re Yang Ye!”

A wisp of surprise flashed through Yang Ye’s eyes, “How did you know?”

Nie Yan replied, “Does anyone in Heaven Pillar Mountain not know your name? We have been observing you since you entered this place.”

Yang Ye rubbed his nose. He hadn’t expected himself to be that famous. Even the Sky Devils knew about him.

Meanwhile, Nie Yan said, “Brother Yang, our patriarch would like to meet you!”

The patriarch of the Sky Devils!

Yang Ye frowned slightly, “Why?”

Nie Yan replied, “I hear it’s about making a deal with you!”

A deal!

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and nodded, “Alright, let’s go!”

“Please come with me!” As soon as he finished speaking, Nie Yan transformed into a ray of dark light that shot into the sky.

Yang Ye issued a command in his heart. An ethereal sword appeared below him, and then he shot into the sky.

It didn’t take long for Yang Ye to arrive in the clouds, and they flew for almost two hours before a palace appeared within Yang Ye’s field of vision.

A palace in the clouds!

They descended before the palace. There were three pitch black words on the top of the palace—Sky Devil Palace!

Nie Yan brought Yang Ye to the palace and gestured for him to go in.

Yang Ye glanced into the palace and walked in. As soon as he did, the space around him trembled slightly.

Yang Ye closed his eyes slowly. The space was still trembling, and it took around 15 minutes for the space there to finally return to calm. Yang Ye opened his eyes. He was still within the hall, but it wasn’t the same hall!

Meanwhile, a voice resounded, “I apologize. We have to be very careful when living amongst humans!”

Yang Ye looked up. A woman in a black dress had appeared not too far away from him. She looked to be around the age of 30. Her figure was exquisite and curvaceous, and her entire body emanated an air of maturity. She was like a ripe peach.

Yang Ye’s face became solemn when he saw her.

Unfathomable!

It was how the woman felt to him, and only Hao Tian and the Devil Progenitor had given him such a feeling.

She smiled, “Yun Bi, the patriarch of the Sky Devils.”

Yang Ye nodded slightly, “I heard you wanted to make a deal with me?”

Yun Bi sized up Yang Ye and smiled, “As expected of the most dazzling genius in the human race. Your disposition and courage are not bad indeed.” She paused for a moment and continued, “I do want to make a deal with you!”

Yang Ye replied, “Please do tell!”

She asked, “Do you know why we’re here?”

Yang Ye shook his head.

Yun Bi explained, “This is the world of man, and it isn’t the world of our Sky Devil Progenitor. We have our own world too. Just like the Xenosprites in the world below. They too aren’t beings from here.”

Yang Ye gazed at her and remained silent.

Yun Bi continued, “During the ancient times, the humans were the weakest, but in the end, as countless human geniuses were born, the humans started to rise up. The rise of the humans naturally threatened the other living beings that ruled the world. So, a war was impossible to avoid. In the end, the humans won the war.”

Yang Ye asked, “What happened to the other races?”

Yun Bi replied, “Fled or died. My ancestors were one of the lucky ones. However, we were imprisoned here forever.”

Yang Ye asked, “Who imprisoned you?”

Yun Bi chuckled, “That isn’t important. The important thing is that we want to leave. Of course, our goal isn’t to take revenge on the humans. We don’t have the strength to do that. We just want to leave this place. Of course, we’ll compensate you well to show our gratitude!”

Yang Ye asked, “How do I release you from this place?”

She suddenly appeared before Yang Ye and said, “With the sword in your hand. Destroy this world. Once it’s destroyed, we’ll be able to leave.”

Yang Ye looked her in the eyes, “It’s not that simple, right?”

She nodded, “Indeed. However, that’s for other people. It isn’t difficult if it’s you. Because that sword in your hand can destroy this place.”

Yang Ye fell silent.

Meanwhile, Yun Bi continued, “Your current physical strength is considered Ordinary Strength. As compensation, I can help you attain Divine Strength. Once your physical body is at the Divine Strength Realm, you’ll be able to fight a true Enlightened Realm expert by relying solely on your physical body!”

Divine Strength!

Yang Ye was visibly moved. Or to be more precise, he was tempted.

His strength had improved tremendously in all aspects, but his body hadn't improved much. If his body attained the Divine Strength Realm, then his strength would rise a level higher!

He would possess the strength to fight and take hits!

However, destroying the barrier which kept them here definitely had its risks.

She seemed to know what Yang Ye was thinking and said, “You don’t have to worry. No one will come looking for trouble with you if you destroy this place. Because that person who imprisoned us here has left for the large universe a long time ago. Perhaps that person has forgotten us by now or even perished.”

Yang Ye remained silent for a long time before he looked her in the eyes, “Alright, I agree!”

She grinned, “Perfect!”

Meanwhile, Yang Ye said, “However, I need you to help me improve my physical strength first.”

She smiled, “No problem. Come with me!”

As soon as she finished speaking, she vanished on the spot.

Yang Ye glanced at her and followed her!
