Chapter 2423 – It’s Not Stealing, It’s Taking!

Yang Ye had quite the headache. Snowy didn’t have a proper idea of how strong he was!

As far as Snowy was concerned, there was nothing he couldn’t defeat, and now, it had brought great trouble to him. Now, he didn’t dare to believe that little bastard anymore!

Snowy gazed at Erya, and the latter glanced at Snowy and spoke indifferently, “Big Brother Yang is right, you need to learn these things!”

Snowy was at a loss for words.

Yang Ye ignored them and looked at the cracks in the mountain wall. A black shadow was slowly floating out of there.

It didn’t take long for Yang Ye to see it clearly. It was human, and based on his outer appearance, he was around 30 years old. A pitch black spear floated behind him.

The middle aged man’s gaze immediately descended onto Yang Ye, but it didn’t take long for his gaze to move down onto Yang Ye’s sword.

He frowned slightly when he saw the sword, “Executor?”

As soon as he finished speaking, he suddenly gazed at Snowy and Erya, and his frown deepened, “Impossible…”

Snowy blinked. She was sneaking glances at the cracks behind the man.

Erya licked her tanghulu while remaining vigilant at all times. She wasn’t Snowy, so she wasn’t that carefree.

The middle aged man gazed at them for a long time and said, “The Sprite Progenitor and Evil…” He glanced at Erya, hesitated for a moment, and continued, “How truly inconceivable. A Sprite Progenitor and you actually exist in such a world.”

Erya suddenly asked, “Who are you?”

The middle aged man glanced at Erya, “A failure!”

Failure!

Erya frowned, “You failed?”

The middle aged man nodded, “I did!”

Erya asked, “What did you fail in?”

The middle aged man smiled, “You’ll find out soon!”

Erya hesitated for a moment and asked, “Will you kill us?”

Obviously, she’d sensed how strong he was, and if he acted against them, they would definitely die here today.

The middle aged man replied with a question, “Why would I kill you?”

Erya nodded, stopped being vigilant against him, and moved over to Yang Ye’s side.

Meanwhile, the middle aged man gazed at Yang Ye, “You’re suppressing your cultivation?”

Yang Ye nodded.

The middle aged man said, “There are benefits and disadvantages to that. The slightest mistake may cause you to die from it.”

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and said, “Senior, please guide me!”

The middle aged man said, “Everything has its limits. Suppressing the cultivation is a unique form of cultivation, and it’s a very extreme one too. It’s like eating, and eating too much may cause you to die from overeating. So, you must improve your mental state while doing this!”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “My mental state?”

The middle aged man explained, “What would happen when a poor person suddenly possesses millions?”

Yang Ye replied solemnly, “That person will lose themselves!”

The middle aged man nodded, “Yes, that person will lose themselves or even become arrogant. However, if the same person slowly accumulated the same amount of wealth, that person will usually not lose themselves. The difference between the two of them is actually their mental state.”

He gazed at Yang Ye and continued, “The more you suppress your cultivation, the more you must focus on the cultivation of your mental state. If it can’t keep up, you’ll kill yourself one day. Now, your cultivation has already surpassed your mental state. So, focus more on it from now on.”

Cultivate the heart!

The mental state!

Yang Ye thought for a long time and nodded, “Thank you for the guidance, Senior!”

He hesitated for a moment and asked, “Senior, are you above the five worlds?”

“Above the five worlds?” The man was stunned for a moment, and then quite a strange expression appeared on his face.

Yang Ye asked, ‘What is it?”

The middle aged man shook his head, “It’s understandable. After all, you’re still very weak!”

Yang Ye’s face froze and was absolutely unsightly. Can’t you hold back a little?

The middle aged man continued, “How should I put it…” He paused for a moment and continued, “You should look further than that, and you can go further too. When you look back in ten years from now, you’ll notice how laughable and immature it was to consider your current enemies as experts.”

Yang Ye smiled, “That does make sense. However, I should focus on what’s before me and take every step well. What do you think?”

“Indeed!” The man nodded slightly and smiled, “It’s very good that you can think in this way.”

He shook his head at this point, “Unfortunately, you’re a sword cultivator and aren’t suited to my path. What a pity!”

Yang Ye glanced at the spear behind him, hesitated for a moment, and asked, “Do you know Senior Wu Ni?”

“Wu Ni?” The middle aged man nodded, “I do!”

Yang Ye asked, “How does your strength compare to his?”

The middle aged man smiled, “I was merely slightly inferior at my prime.”

Yang Ye smiled when he heard this, and then An Nanjing appeared by his side.

Once An Nanjing appeared here, the middle aged man’s gaze immediately fell on her, “The Martial God Physique!”

Yang Ye smiled, “Senior, do you think she’s suitable?”

The middle aged man grinned, “Of course!”

He gazed at her and continued, “Are you willing to learn my Spear Dao?”

An Nanjing asked, “Is it strong?”

He nodded, “Of course!”

An Nanjing replied, “Then of course!”

The middle aged man’s grin widened, “My Spear Dao has but one attack. One attack in a battle, and just that is enough!”

As he spoke, the middle aged man started to pass it down to her. He didn’t make Yang Ye leave. Obviously, he wanted to guide Yang Ye too.

Yang Ye naturally grabbed such an opportunity. He sat down cross-legged and listened in silence with An Nanjing!

Meanwhile, Snowy glanced left and right, and then she pulled Erya with her as she sneaked off. It didn’t take long for them to arrive before the cracks in the wall.

Erya asked softly, “Snowy, are you trying to steal his treasures?”

Steal?

Snowy blinked and then she waved her paws swiftly.

Snowy was telling her it wasn’t stealing, it was taking!

Taking!

Erya glanced at Snowy, “But you’re taking them without their owner’s permission, so it’s stealing. Stealing isn’t very good!”

Her grandfather had taught her a lot in Eternal Village, and one of it was that she couldn’t steal.

Snowy blinked, and then she waved her paws. She was saying that even if the owner didn’t agree, it was alright if she received the agreement of the treasures themselves.

Erya thought for a moment and said, “That does make sense, but something about it doesn’t seem right!”

Snowy cracked a smile and pulled her into the cracks. Meanwhile, Yang Ye and the others ignored the two little fellows.

Just like that, Snowy and Erya just swaggered off into the cracks, and it didn’t take long for them to stop abruptly. Snowy’s eyes seemed like they were studded with stars, and even Erya was staring ahead.

There was a pile of fist-sized crystals ahead, all of them were dark violet crystals.

World Crystals!

Eternal Border had Eternal Immortal Crystals and Eternal Divine Crystals, but the most precious was Eternal World Crystals.

World Crystals were crystals condensed from the spirit of a world. Such crystals were very, very rare. It could be said that just one could be exchanged for at least a thousand Eternal Divine Crystals, and it was impossible to exchange successfully.

The most prominent effect of Eternal World Crystals wasn’t their ability to improve a person’s cultivation, it was to replenish spirit energy. Even Five World Realm experts could instantly replenish their profound energy with a single one of these crystals.

If two people were in a battle of life and death, and their strengths were equally matched, then a single Eternal World Crystal was very likely to be the key to deciding the victor.

Besides that, Eternal World Crystals could improve a person’s cultivation, and they contained a type of profound energy called World Energy!

The purest form of spirit energy in a world!

Such spirit energy was very, very beneficial to cultivation. For example, it could help someone advance from their realm of cultivation!

World Energy was one of the ten great spirit energies, and every one of them had their own advantages! World Energy’s advantage was its ability to help with breakthroughs!

So long as one had sufficient World Energy and was at a sufficient level of cultivation, one could advance!

But there were at least 300 Eternal World Crystals here!

Even if it was Eternal Border, it would take at least 10,000 years to form a few hundred of these crystals, let alone 300.

They were rich!Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Snowy blinked as she gazed at the pile of crystals, and then she waved her paws and took all of them!

Snowy cracked a smile and pulled Erya forward.

A long time later, she stopped again. A ball of pure white light was floating before them.

Erya blinked and asked, “What’s that?”

Snowy shook her head and waved her paw. The ball of white light immediately flew over to them.

Snowy hesitated for a moment and patted it gently. In an instant, countless strands of spirit energy surged out of the white ball of light, and it was so much that it seemed boundless like a universe.

A short while passed before Snowy lowered her paw, shuddered, and then sniffed the ball of light while holding it in her paws.

Hiss!

In an instant, countless strands of spirit energy surged into her.

In just an instant, the spirit energy throughout the Abyss World rapidly grew scarcer, and Snowy’s eyes became a little more violet as well. Besides that, the white and fluffy tail behind her had gradually started to turn light violet!

A short while passed before Erya patted Snowy on the head, and Snowy stopped. She gazed at Erya, and the latter spoke softly, “Snowy, take it slow. Don’t overdo it!”

Snowy blinked, and then she passed the ball of light to Erya. Erya hesitated for a moment and sniffed lightly. Countless strands of spirit energy surged into Erya. Erya seemed like she’d gotten addicted and continued for around 10 minutes before her ears stood up. Moreover, the veins beneath the skin on her arms started to tremble.

In the Primordial Pagoda, Oxxy, the Primal True Dragon, the Primal Vicious Tiger, and the Martial Qilin suddenly looked up, and their eyes were filled with terror!

Outside the crack, the middle aged man who was teaching Yang Ye and An Nanjing suddenly stopped, and then he looked toward the cracks, “Awakening of the bloodline?”
