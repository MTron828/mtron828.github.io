Chapter 2635 – I Killed My Way Out!

An instant kill!

Everyone here was stunned.

The black clothed experts could instantly annihilate experts from Eternal Kingdom who were in the same realm of cultivation, but Yang Ye could kill them in an instant too!

How terrifying was Yang Ye’s strength?

Huang Xuan’s face instantly turned gloomy from being provoked like that. There was still a slight smile on his face, but it was a gloomy smile too.

Yang Ye naturally didn’t fear him. He glanced at the other five sickle-wielding black clothed figures and said, “How about you tell them to join forces against me?”

Provocation!

Undisguised provocation!

There was killing intent in Huang Xuan’s eyes. He was about to speak when he suddenly frowned, and then he gazed at Yang Ye, “You killed your way out of Darkspace!”

Killed his way out!

At this moment, Huang Xuan was quite shocked because someone had told him how Yang Ye left Darkspace.

The disciples of the desolate race had merely trained there. It was mutually agreed upon between the desolate race and the Dark Lord.

But Yang Ye was different, he’d killed his way out of that place!

He’d killed until the Dark Lord had been forced to send him away!

It could be said that there was a huge difference between him and those six disciples of the desolate race.

Yang Ye glanced at Huang Xuan, and then he walked over to Ye Zhibei and Xing Biqing, “You’re no match for them, so just leave!”

He’d stepped forward for the sake of Ye Zhibei and Xing Biqing, of course!

He didn’t care about the fate of others from Eternal Kingdom, and he wouldn’t interfere in it as well. But he had to when it was these two!

They exchanged glances, and then Xing Biqing shook her head, “If we retreat now, our clans will become the laughingstock of Eternal Kingdom.”

It would be a humiliation!

Anyone from Eternal Kingdom who retreated now would be a humiliation. Especially disciples from the large clans like them. Moreover, if they retreated, it would be quite a blow to the other clans.

Confidence!

Confidence was the most important at a time like this!

Yang Ye gazed at them for a long time and was about to speak when Huang Xuan suddenly said, “Stop putting on that act in front of me! I don’t have the time to listen to your nonsense!”

As soon as Huang Xuan finished speaking, a strand of faint slaughter intent rippled out of Yang Ye, and then he gazed at Huang Xuan and started walking in the latter’s direction, “You’re really not happy, huh?”

Huang Xuan grinned, “I am!”

Yang Ye’s eyes instantly turned blood red, and then he appeared before Huang Xuan and swung his sword!

The Domain Sword!

Unlike before, it carried two Domains this time!

Huang Xuan’s expression changed slightly when he noticed the strength of Yang Ye’s attack, and he didn’t dare to act carelessly. However, he didn’t dodge, and he just swung his axe forward.

A head-on collision!

The world exploded apart beneath this attack!

Boom!

An explosion resounded, and then the space around them was obliterated!

A figure was pushed over 1km away!

It wasn’t Yang Ye but Huang Xuan!

If it was just the Sword Domain, Yang Ye would be absolutely incapable of fighting a peak Destiny Realm expert like Huang Xuan, but he had two Domains. Coupled with his dual intents and Executor, he had the strength to fight a peak Destiny Realm expert!

Yang Ye walked in Huang Xuan’s direction. The experts of Eternal Kingdom were delighted by the sight of this.

If Yang Ye entered into battle with the desolate race, they would naturally feel happy about it.

They would have a much better chance at winning with Yang Ye on their side.

However, Yang Ye suddenly stopped, glanced at the experts of Eternal Kingdom with a ridiculing smile on his face, and then he flashed over 1km away.

Countless experts from Eternal Kingdom were stunned.

He isn’t going to help?

Xing Biqing sighed softly. She naturally knew about the enmity between Yang Ye and the Eternal Kingdom. So, it was good enough if he didn’t act against Eternal Kingdom at a time like this.

As for asking him to fight the desolate race?

That was no more than a daydream!

Liu Yuan sighed softly as well. Not only was Eternal Kingdom unable to entrust any hope on Yang Ye fighting for them against the desolate race, they had to be wary of him!

Eternal Kingdom had done just that.

If Yang Ye really attacked Eternal Kingdom, there would naturally be someone to deal with him!

Huang Xuan glanced coldly at Yang Ye. While he was extremely unhappy, he didn’t provoke Yang Ye again. He wasn’t afraid of Yang Ye, it was just unwise to offend that madman at a time like this.

Huang Xuan moved his gaze away from Yang Ye, and then he raised his palm and pressed it down.

The five sickle-wielding black clothed figures charged at Xing Biqing and the others.

They advanced in a row while waving their sickles incessantly, and they formed a long line of afterimages behind them!

They were absolutely fast!

Meanwhile, the elites of Eternal Kingdom charged at them as well!

Suddenly, something unexpected occurred. A few dozen black clothed figures appeared around the five experts from the desolate race, and all of them held daggers in their grasps. Besides that, they emanated no auras, and they moved like phantoms!

Assassins!

They were the elite assassins of Heaven’s Avatar!

Yang Ye shook his head. People who trained in Darkspace would absolutely not fear assassins. No matter how terrifying these assassins were, they couldn’t compete with the Darkspawn of Darkspace. Moreover, training in that pitch black place had made their reaction absolutely terrifying.

Sure enough, as soon as the assassins appeared, the five sickle-wielding experts swiftly reacted.

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!

In an instant, a few black clothed figures lost their heads!

Those assassins were like a joke to those five experts from the desolate race.

However, Xing Biqing and the others had arrived.

Almost 30 were besieging just five people!

However, not only did those five avoid death, they were suppressing their opponents. Moreover, people on Xing Biqing’s side were dying every moment.

Liu Yuan and Huang Xuan stood in confrontation.

Huang Xuan had a smile on his face while Liu Yuan’s face was gloomy.

On the other side, Yang Ye stood there silently.

Xing Biqing and Ye Zhibei almost lost their lives a few times during this time.

At this moment, he was quite conflicted.

To save them or not to save them?

If he didn’t save them and allowed this to continue, then Ye Zhibei and Xing Biqing would definitely die unless the Eternal Kingdom had other backup plans.

Conversely, if he saved them, they would definitely not agree to leave with him because they had their own choices!

He had a huge headache!

Meanwhile, the battle was still going on!

Based on the situation, Eternal Kingdom was being suppressed!

Even though the desolate race didn’t have an advantage in numbers, it had an absolute advantage in quality.

Suddenly, Yang Ye’s expression changed slightly, and then he vanished on the spot.

A sickle shot swiftly toward Xing Biqing’s throat. She’d lost the initiative in the battle, so she couldn’t dodge it or stop it.

Even though she was from the War Dimension, these fellows were from an even crueler place!

Suddenly, Xing Biqing felt her body tremble, and when she opened her eyes next, she saw the sickle was 300m away from her!

Yang Ye was behind her.

Huang Xuan’s eyes narrowed slightly when he saw Yang Ye interfere, and the desire to kill flickered within his eyes.

Yang Ye was challenging his limits!

Xing Biqing glanced at Yang Ye, “You shouldn’t have interfered!”

Yang Ye shook his head, “How can I watch you die before me?”

Xing Biqing wanted to say more, but Yang Ye interrupted her, “You’ve died once for Eternal Kingdom. Now, your life is mine.”

Yang Ye sent her into the Primordial Pagoda.

Xing Biqing couldn’t leave without his permission!

After he sent her away, Yang Ye flashed over to Ye Zhibei, and he sent her into the Primordial Pagoda before she could even react.

Yang Ye wasn’t able to just watch as they died before him.

They were the two people who’d helped him the most in Eternal Kingdom.

It was something he would never forget!

Once he saved them, Yang Ye returned to where he’d been, and he ignored everyone here throughout this process.

Huang Xing glanced coldly at Yang Ye and didn’t say anything.VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

As for Eternal Kingdom, they wouldn’t say anything either.

The battle was still going on!

Eternal Kingdom was showing signs of being defeated!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly looked up into the sky. The battle there was much more intense than the battle down below. Of course, it was more important too.

If the outcome of that battle was decided in advance, then the outcome of the entire war would be decided.

Due to them being too far away, Yang Ye couldn’t see the battle clearly. However, based on the sound of it, it wouldn’t be decided that soon.

Yang Ye moved his gaze away and looked at Liu Yuan. If Eternal Kingdom had no more trump cards, it was clearly about to be destroyed!

Because the Desolate Deathguard had charged into Eternal Kingdom. So long as they dealt with the remaining War Guards, they would be able to bring destruction to Eternal Kingdom!

Once that began, Eternal Kingdom would be in huge trouble!

Suddenly, something unexpected happened. The spirit energy in the surroundings became scarce. Moreover, some bodies of energy appeared around the Desolate Deathguard and the five sickle-wielding experts from the desolate race!

These types of energy encompassed lightning, fire, water, earth, wind, cloud…

All sorts of sprites had appeared!

The Sprite Palace!

Along with the arrival of these sprites, the Desolate Deathguard and the sickle-wielding experts were surrounded by invisible energy formations, and they trapped them.

Huang Xuan grinned, “The Sprite Palace… Interesting!”
