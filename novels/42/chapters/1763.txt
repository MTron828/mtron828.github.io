Chapter 1764 – Why Didn’t You Say So?

Shao Siyou!

Those words weren’t new to Yang Ye. Because he’d heard of it from Blood Maiden. That person was the creator of the Nether Pavilion.

“Heaven Pillar Mountain!” The mysterious woman added, “It’s very dangerous. Because it’s linked to the large universe, beings from the large universe appear there from time to time. So, Young Master Yang, I need your help. Of course, they need your help too!”

Yang Ye asked, “Why are all of you looking for your previous pavilion master?”

Silence filled the room.

A long time passed before she spoke again, “Do you know that many from the Nether Pavilion are orphans, including me. It was Pavilion Master Shao Siyou who took us in and taught us, allowing us to have a chance to change our fate. She isn’t just a pavilion master to us.”

She paused for a moment and continued, “We’re searching for her because we want to know if she has gone to the large universe or if she has fallen.”

Yang Ye frowned slightly, “She can die at her level of strength?”

Even though he didn’t know how strong Shao Siyou was, Shao Siyou had fought her way through countless systems and remained undefeated! Such a person was definitely an extraordinary expert like the Unfettered One.

“No one is absolutely invincible!” The mysterious woman continued, “The world is huge, and the universe is larger. There’s no one who’s strongest, and there’s only a stronger person.”

Yang Ye fell silent for a long time and said, “I’m not free for now!”

If it was at any other time, he would be willing to travel to Heaven Pillar Mountain. Because Nether Maiden and the others had gone there. He wanted to see his old friends too. But if he left now, Yang Lianshuang and the others would definitely fall into a hopeless situation.

Moreover, Su Qingshi and the others were in the Yang Clan. So, he absolutely couldn’t leave at a time like this!𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

A moment of silence ensued within the room, and then the mysterious woman said, “Young Master Yang, if I’m to be honest, the Yang Clan can’t fight the five clans.”

Yang Ye smiled, “But I can’t just surrender, right?”

The mysterious woman fell silent for a long time, “Half a year. There’s half a year more before then. If you’re able to resolve the Yang Clan’s issues by then, then we’ll head to Heaven Pillar Mountain together. Alright?”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and agreed, “Alright!”

He stood up as he spoke, “If there’s nothing else, then I’ll be taking my leave.”

She replied, “I have a piece of information that may be slightly useful to you!”

Yang Ye said, “Please do tell!”

She said, “Be wary of the Ku Clan!”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “What do you mean?”

She explained, “The Ying Clan is actually not that terrifying. Because their strength is openly revealed. Everyone knows what they’re planning. But the Ku Clan… Do you know its true strength? Do you know what they are planning?”

Yang Ye frowned, “Do you know something?”

She replied, “It’s nothing. I’m just giving you a reminder. I’m tired, so please leave!”

Yang Ye gazed at the screen for a long time and said, “Farewell!”

He turned around and vanished from the room.

A short moment of silence ensued within the room, and then she suddenly spoke softly, “The True Realm? Unfortunately, it still isn’t enough!”

…

Once he left Sword Immortal City, Yang Ye rushed back to the Yang Clan.

Presently, the Yang Clan had abandoned all other worlds except Heaven Void Continent. It didn’t have the ability to guard that many worlds. Since it couldn’t keep them, it was better to abandon them and preserve their strength!

The Ying Clan and the other clans didn’t give up the opportunity, and the Yang Clan’s territory was split up amongst them.

The Yang Clan didn’t offer any reaction towards that.

However, everyone throughout the medium universe could sense the arrival of a storm.

Moment Mountain.

Yang Ye didn’t stay long in the Yang Clan. He went to Moment Mountain instead. It was still as calm as it had been

Yang Ye stood silently for a long time at the foot of the mountain, and then he entered Moment Mountain.

All along the way, Yang Ye didn’t encounter any rotting corpses, and it didn’t take long for him to arrive at Moment City.

Moment City was deathly silent, and there were no signs of life here.

Yang Ye went to the largest pavilion in Moment City, Moment Pavilion.

Right when he was about to enter the pavilion, a blood red middle aged man obstructed his path. The man said nothing and just stood in his way.

Yang Ye fell silent for a moment before he looked at the pavilion, “We’re acquaintances no matter what. You don’t have to be so cold, right?”

A moment later, Yang Ye felt the scene before him transform, and then he appeared within the hall.

Yang Ye’s face became extremely solemn.

Because she’d brought him into the hall before he could even react!

The woman in a red dress was in the seat of the host.

Yang Ye gazed at her and revealed a brilliant smile, “Hi, long time no see!”

She gazed at him and remained silent.

Yang Ye didn’t feel embarrassed. He walked over to her and stopped just a meter away, and he said, “I’m in a little trouble!”

Just as the mysterious woman in Sword Immortal City had said, the Yang Clan wasn’t able to stop the joint forces of the five clans. So, he wanted to find help. It was pointless to go to the Wu Clan and Ku Clan. Because that was impossible.

Thus, he thought of a person, this woman before him. Even though the chances were slim, he still wanted to give it a try.

She gazed at Yang Ye and spoke indifferently, “Does that have anything to do with me?”

He naturally couldn’t be shy at this moment. He smiled and said, “How about we make a deal?”

She shook her head, “I refuse!”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Why?”

She gazed at Yang Ye and replied, “Because you currently lack the qualifications to do that!”

Yang Ye’s face stiffened, but it didn’t take long for it to return to normal, “I’m not qualified right now, but I may be qualified in the future!”

She replied, “That’s for the future!”

Yang Ye walked over to her, “You can invest! Don’t you think I have huge potential?”

She gazed at Yang Ye for a long time before she replied, “I’ve met many thick-skinned people, but I’ve never met anyone as thick-skinned as you!”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

Meanwhile, the woman continued, “Investments have risk. What if you die, then wouldn’t my investment be lost? Moreover, if I’m to be honest, I don’t need your help, and you can’t help me. My enemies are beyond your imagination!”

Yang Ye fell silent. Needless to say, it was quite a blow to his confidence.

She said, “I do have an idea!”

Yang Ye gazed at her, “What?”

She looked at Yang Ye and continued, “You’re really not bad. Follow me. If you’re willing to follow me, then even if all eight clans in this medium universe act against you, they wouldn’t be able to kill you while you’re under my protection.”

Yang Ye smiled and shook his head, “You have to realize that I’m a sword cultivator!

A sword cultivator!

The heart of a sword cultivator needed freedom. If he chose to submit to her, then would his heart be free?

As far as Yang Ye was concerned, there were three things that he absolutely couldn’t lose.

Freedom, dignity, and backbone!

Not only would he lose his freedom from siding with her, he would lose his dignity and backbone. Just think about it, once he became someone’s subordinate, he would have to do everything the person said, and he would have to act according to that person’s mood and preferences. So, wouldn’t it be equivalent to losing his dignity and backbone?

Instead of living like that, it was better to die with dignity!

She gazed at Yang Ye for a long time before she said, “Then there’s nothing left for us to talk about!”

Yang Ye was silent for quite some time, and then he said, “You have so many rotting corpses. Can you lend me a few?”

That was his true objective. He’d never hoped to make her help him personally. That wasn’t realistic at all. However, if it was just lending him some rotting corpses, then he felt that he still had a slim chance.

The woman in a red dress asked, “Why should I?”

Yang Ye gazed at Yang Ye for a long time before he said, “Actually, it’s nothing for you. Of course, I understand. After all, you have no obligation to help me. However, I’ll remember this moment.”

Yang Ye turned around and walked away.

When he arrived at the exit, he suddenly stopped and added, “You think I’m weak right now and have no right to make a deal with you. That’s fine. But allow me to tell you that while you look down on me now, trust me that it won’t be long before you’ll be far too much below me!”

As soon as Yang Ye finished speaking, he vanished on the spot.

Once Yang Ye left, an arc of ridicule curled up on the corners of her mouth.

Suddenly, a flame appeared not too far away from her, and she frowned upon seeing it.

The Divine Yin Flame!

The Divine Yin Flame suddenly said, “My Master once told me to never look down on any living beings, even a droplet of water. A droplet of water’s strength is absolutely insignificant, but it can pierce through a rock.”

The Divine Yin Flame vanished after speaking those words.

The woman fell silent in the hall, and a long time passed before she suddenly said, “I don’t believe in all living beings, I only believe in myself!”

…

After he left Moment Mountain, Yang Ye returned to the Yang Clan. As soon as he got back, Yang Lianshuang summoned him to Phecda Hall. At this moment, all the experts of the Yang Clan were here.

Yang Ye asked, “What happened?”

Yang Lianshuang replied, “The Ying Clan and those other clans have taken action.”

Yang Ye asked, “What are they doing?”

Yang Lianshuang was about to speak when she suddenly exchanged glances with Yang Ye, and then they vanished on the spot and arrived in the sky above Phecda City.

An old man had appeared in the sky, and there was a tiny ‘赢’ embroidered on the old man’s left chest.

He was an expert of the Ying Clan!

The old man glanced at them and said, “If the Yang Clan surrenders by today, you can avoid being annihilated. Otherwise….”

Suddenly, the old man’s expression changed drastically, and then his figure stiffened. A moment later, a hole cracked open on his forehead and blood seeped out from there.

At the same time, Yang Ye had suddenly appeared in front of him.

The old man stared at Yang Ye, “Emissaries have immunity in war. You….”

Yang Ye looked at Yang Lianshuang and asked, “There’s such a rule?”

She nodded, “There is!”

Yang Ye patted his forehead and gazed at the old man. He spoke in a regretful tone, “Why didn’t you say so?”

Everyone here was speechless.
