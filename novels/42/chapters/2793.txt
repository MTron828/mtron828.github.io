Chapter 2794 – Pressure!

Decide on life and death in one clash!

The blood of countless throughout Universe City boiled with excitement when they heard Yang Ye!

Since the beginning, Universe City had been under too much pressure. It was like a rock was pressing down on them, and they were suffocating. Yet now, along with those words spoken by Yang Ye, it was like the rock had been shattered.

Morale!

Universe City’s morale had risen along with those words spoken by Yang Ye!

The Destiny Realm experts by Ding Shaoyao’s side seemed to visibly relax. Moreover, they saw hope once more!

Someone had to step forward at a time like this!

Obviously, Yang Ye had done just that!

In the sky, Monarch Yan took a step forward, “Why wouldn’t I?”

He had to accept the challenge at a time like this!

He had no other choice!

If he refused to accept the challenge, it would be a lethal blow to the Four Dimensional Universe. Moreover, he wanted to fight Yang Ye too. If he could kill Yang Ye, the Four Dimensional Universe’s losses would be reduced to the minimum!

Yang Ye had similar thoughts. If he could kill Monarch Yan, Universe City’s losses could be reduced to a minimum too!

Both of them couldn’t afford to lose this battle!

Yang Ye walked slowly toward the sky. At this moment, his aura wasn’t oppressive and imposing at all, and it was just calm and composed. He was truly calm and composed, not something that was intentionally put on by force.

His Sword Dao had undergone a tremendous transformation in this short amount of time.

Monarch Yan watched calmly from above as Yang Ye walked up in his direction.

Monarch Yan didn’t look down on Yang Ye at all, and he was treating Yang Ye as an equal. This time, he would fight Yang Ye with everything he had!

The silence in the surroundings was quite unusual. Both the experts of the Three Dimensional Universe and Four Dimensional Universe had their eyes on Yang Ye and Monarch Yang!

One of them was the lord of the Four Dimensional Universe, a supreme overlord who’d reigned for countless years; the other was the lord of the Three Dimensional Universe, a monstrous genius who’d just risen up to take his place in the world!

This battle was bound to be exciting!

Of course, it was bound to be intense too, and the outcome wouldn’t just bring ruin to one of them, it would bring ruin to one of their universes. Because if one of them lost the battle, it represented that the others from their universe would be annihilated!

It didn’t take long for Yang Ye to arrive before Monarch Yan.

They stood in confrontation from afar, and there was less than 300m between them.

When looking at them from below, there didn’t seem to be much distance between them!

In the sky, Yang Ye didn’t waste his breath and just stabbed.

The Fate Sword Dao!

One clash to decide their fate!

Yang Ye’s sword stabbed at Monarch Yan. No energy erupted from it, nor did it make the world dim down.

It was a very ordinary stab!

However, everyone could sense the intent carried within the sword.

The intent to decide their fate!

He wasn’t joking when he asked to decide their life and death in one clash. He was serious. Perhaps it wasn’t really able to decide their fate, but he had the determination to do it.

The intent was most important when wielding a sword!

Monarch Yan remained calm and composed when facing this attack.

Countless watched as he slowly clenched his right fist, and a strand of flames suddenly ignited within his palm. A moment later, the flames stretched out from his palm and instantly spread throughout his body!

At this moment, Monarch Yan was covered in fiery lightning, and a bolt of fiery lightning was flowing incessantly around him like a serpent.

A merger of lightning and body!

Monarch Yan closed his eyes slowly and spoke softly, “Universe Incineration!”

As soon as he said that, he pressed his right palm forward. In an instant, the flames around him followed the serpent of fiery lightning toward his arm and surged forward like a huge volcanic eruption!

At this instant, everything in the world seemed to instantly start to turn ethereal!

Universe City even started burning in an instant!

In the sky, a sword stabbed against the fiery lightning.

Hiss!

The space around them was instantly torn apart and incinerated. The speed at which it was torn apart and incinerated caused the expressions of countless to change drastically. At this moment, both the experts of Universe City and the experts from the Four Dimensional Universe shot backward without daring to stay for even a moment.

Even the mysterious expert and the others from the End World had retreated at this moment!

Yang Ye and Monarch Yan’s strength was sufficient to destroy the entire Eternal Kingdom. However, they didn’t dare to let their energy disperse and focused it all on their opponent. Otherwise, even the entire Eternal Kingdom would have been destroyed. Even then, the aftershock of their collision couldn’t be underestimated at all!

Everyone shot backward, and only Yang Ye and Monarch Yan remained in the sky!

Yang Ye’s sword was still pressed against the fiery lightning, and the flames emanated by the fiery lightning had been forced to a stop by Yang Ye’s sword! It couldn’t spread out at all!

Both of them refused to retreat!

At this moment, the one who retreated would die!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly took a step forward, and his sword sliced open the lightning. However, the lightning suddenly transformed into two arcs that shot at him.

They were extremely swift!

At practically the exact same moment, Yang Ye suddenly released his sword, and it shot forward.

Bang!

Hiss!Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Two fine arcs of lightning slammed against Yang Ye’s chest, and he was pushed over 1km away. Space was forcibly torn open and incinerated in his wake. Moreover, at the moment Yang Ye was pushed back, his sword stabbed against Monarch Yan’s chest. However, it stopped just after stabbing a few inches deep. Monarch Yan had grabbed the Sword Precursor firmly, and arcs of fiery lightning were ceaselessly enveloping it.

Yang Ye stopped, glanced at the fiery lightning around him, and then waved his right hand.

Bang!

The fiery lightning instantly vanished!

Even though his chest was scorched black, it only took a moment for it to recover completely.

His recovery was something that perhaps only Snowy could compete with in this world!

Meanwhile, a terrifying aura suddenly erupted from Monarch Yan, and it enveloped the Sword Precursor. Coupled with the impact of the fiery lightning, the Sword Precursor instantly exploded apart and was turned to ask!

However, a sword soundlessly condensed in Yang Ye’s grasp!

The Sword Precursor!

Countless people had disbelief on their faces when they witnessed this!

Yang Ye’s sword had been destroyed just now!

On the other side, Zuo Mu frowned, “What was that?”

The mysterious expert explained softly, “A sword made of blood. His sword is his blood, and his blood is his sword. So long as he is alive and has blood running through him, his sword will never be destroyed!”

Zuo Mu spoke solemnly, “I see!”

The mysterious expert spoke softly, “That young man has been progressing rapidly. While his progress isn’t that stable, it cannot be underestimated!”

Zuo Mu glanced at the mysterious expert, “Can Monarch Yan kill him?”

The mysterious expert shook his head, “Both Monarch Yan and I cannot kill him on our own anymore. Unless we are willing to expose our full strength and even go as far as to use some secret techniques. Only then can we kill him. However, he has a chance to kill us too.”

Zuo Mu shook his head, “We should have annihilated him back then!”

In the past, he’d repeatedly suggested that Yang Ye should be killed. Unfortunately, the mysterious expert had never listened to him and the mysterious expert just kept concealing his strength!

Now, Yang Ye was impossible to kill!

The mysterious expert replied softly, “Destiny is his enemy too.”

The others were stunned speechless.

Yang Ye suddenly leaped up in the distant sky. He was like a monkey leaping for a branch, and Monarch Yan suddenly took a stride forward as well, but he was like an evil tiger that was impossible to stop as it pounced on its prey!

Yang Ye suddenly drew his sword and swung it. As soon as it descended, Yang Ye’s figure turned ethereal. At this moment, he’d used the Sword Domain to transcend this part of space, so while it wasn’t an attack that carried his Fate Sword Dao, it was still extremely powerful.

Monarch Yan had a fiery bolt of lightning in each grasp as he shot up into the air and slammed against Yang Ye’s attack!

Boom!

A ray of sword energy and two arcs of lightning exploded apart in midair, and the world shook violently. A moment later, two figures were locked in combat.

They were extremely fast to the point the experts below could only see two vague figures, and they couldn’t determine the exact location of Yang Ye and Monarch Yan!

Ding Shaoyao moved her gaze away and looked at Liu Yuan and Huang Ying, “Staying here won’t change a thing. Many experts of the Four Dimensional Universe have spread all over our universe, and the other worlds of this universe are no match for them. Take 10 Destiny Realm experts each and help those worlds. Fight if you can, retreat if you can’t. Try to preserve your strength!”

Liu Yuan frowned slightly, “What about this city?”

Ding Shaoyao shook her head, “The outcome here depends on Yang Ye. If he loses, we lose; if he wins, we win.”

Liu Yuan glanced at the two shadows flashing through the sky and nodded, “Farewell, Miss Ding!”

Huang Ying cupped his fist as well, “Farewell!”

Both of them left with around 20 Destiny Realm experts.

As she watched them leave, Ding Shaoyao’s face was extremely gloomy.

Because she’d received news that the entire universe was in chaos. It was in extreme chaos. Many had seized this opportunity to start wars, and some had fully unleashed the darkness in their hearts!

Ding Shaoyao withdrew a transmission stone, and then a voice came from within it, “Do you need our help?”

A familiar voice!

Ding Shaoyao shook her head, “Miss Nether Maiden, you’re the Guardians of the Universe now. I need all of you to patrol the Three Dimensional Universe.”

A moment of silence ensued before the voice on the other side said, “Can he deal with it?”

Ding Shaoyao shot a glance at the two shadows in the sky, “He’s putting his life on the line. Your presence won’t change a thing here. All of you will be more useful patrolling the universe!”

“Understood.”

Ding Shaoyao put the transmission stone away and looked up.

Suddenly, the two shadows in the sky split apart!

Yang Ye and Monarch Yan stood in confrontation from afar. The latter stared at Yang Ye, and no one knew what he was thinking.

Yang Ye remained indifferent, and his sword was at a downward angle!

Suddenly, a sword descended from somewhere above the clouds. It didn’t descend to the Three Dimensional Universe, and it arrived in the Four Dimensional Universe instead. The sword descended straight down, and space was obliterated inch by inch as it descended.

It wasn’t just a small expanse of space but the space throughout the Four Dimensional Universe!

Monarch Yan’s eyes almost split apart from rage when he noticed this, and he looked up and howled furiously and hysterically, “Why?! Why?!”

A voice came from above the clouds, “I’m giving you some motivation. I want the Three Dimensional Universe to be devoid of life in a day. Otherwise, the Four Dimensional Universe will be devoid of life instead.”
