Chapter 2672 – Defiance Alliance?

Yang Ye left the Destiny Dimension with Erya and Snowy.

It was quite a pity that he still didn’t know anything about Qi Bitian and Tian Xiu’s whereabouts. Fortunately, based on the strength they possessed, it would be quite difficult for them to be in mortal danger.

Just as the woman in black had said, he should be worried about himself!

Outside the Destiny Dimension.

Yang Ye walked over to the Emperor Corpse with Heaven Executor in his grasp. He sized it up and said, “I have a bit too much trouble plaguing me right now, so I need someone to help me in battle. Are you willing to do that?”

The Emperor Corpse remained silent for a long time, and then it nodded slightly.

Yang Ye nodded and swung his sword.

It struck the sword energy that were on the Emperor Corpse’s feet.

Hiss!

Heaven Executor obliterated the sword energy.

It was absolutely easy!

Because the sword energy belonged to Heaven Executor!

Just like that, Yang Ye had another formidable expert’s help. It was no ordinary expert as it was at the peak of the Destiny Realm, and it had attained such strength without relying on any external sources of help.

In the Primordial Pagoda.

Yang Ye sized up the armor Erya and Snowy had given him.

It was pitch black and seemed to be made from some kind of scales. The armor emanated dense black light, and it felt very heavy and oppressive.

Erya spoke softly by Yang Ye’s side, “This thing is very strong!”

Yang Ye gazed at Erya, and she slammed a punch against it. The armor shook and sunk down.

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

Erya pointed at it and said, “See? I can’t destroy it with one punch!”

Yang Ye felt speechless.

Meanwhile, Snowy slammed her fist on the armor, but nothing happened to it.

Snowy blinked and put her fist down.

Yang Ye rubbed Snowy’s head and gazed at the armor. The impression on the armor had vanished, and it had returned to normal.

It was pretty good!

Yang Ye naturally didn’t refuse the armor and wore it. A moment later, it merged into his body, and there was a form of mysterious connection between them.

So long as he needed it, he could summon it at any moment!

As for what the armor’s name was or what its origins were, he had no interest in them.

In any case, the armor belonged to him!

Yang Ye left the Primordial Pagoda and vanished into the boundless reaches of outer space.

In the Primordial Pagoda.

Erya went to the cultivation room, and there was someone there, An Nanjing!

An Nanjing was seated cross-legged at the side, and there was a spear floating by her side, Dagger-Axe.

Erya didn’t disturb An Nanjing and just sat at the side before withdrawing the scroll.

The Six Crushers!

It was the scroll she’d obtained from Yang Busi’s tomb, and she’d taken it because it was straightforward. Moreover, her intuition told her that it may be suitable for her.

Erya unfurled the scroll, and she saw that they were fist techniques… Erya nodded with satisfaction and she felt that she could try learning them.

Just like that, Erya started cultivating a technique!

Even though Snowy was playful, she would consciously choose to cultivate now. However, she wasn’t as diligent as when the woman in black was with her.

Now, she cultivated for a day and played for another… Or played for two days and cultivated for one!

In any case, she was cultivating!

That was how she thought!

Outside the Primordial Pagoda.

Yang Ye shot forward on his sword, and he was back at Eternal Border around four hours later.

Yang Ye arrived where the Eternal River used to be, and he withdrew Heaven Executor. However, the woman in white didn’t appear before him. Yang Ye refused to give up, and he waited over two hours more, but she still didn’t appear before him.

Yang Ye was quite disappointed and left the Eternal River. Right when he was about to enter Eternal Kingdom, he suddenly looked to the side.

The desolate race!

Yang Ye saw the desolate race!

He fell silent for a moment and vanished on the spot.

The desolate race’s camp.

Yang Ye saw Huang Ying.

They seemed quite unfamiliar with each other when they met again.

The bond they once shared seemed to have faded slightly.

Huang Ying smiled, “Long time no see.”

Yang Ye nodded, “Are you still going to attack the Eternal Kingdom?”

Huang Ying nodded.

Yang Ye was quite puzzled, “Why?”

The desolate race had a huge advantage in the past because of the Desolate Emperor, but the Desolate Emperor was gone now. So they had no advantage against Eternal Kingdom.

It was quite unwise to attack Eternal Kingdom right now.

Huang Ying laughed bitterly, “Our ancestor exhausted too, too many resources of the Desolate World to attack Eternal Kingdom. It can be said that the Desolate World won’t last for long. If we don’t attack, the desolate race will fall into a decline. In other words, it’ll be a slow death for us. We have no other choice.”

He gazed at Yang Ye and continued, “What about you? If memory serves, they weren’t very friendly to you. So, what do you think? This is a very good opportunity.”

Yang Ye glanced at Huang Ying, “I’ll resolve my business with them on my own. As for you, take care!”

Huang Ying nodded slightly and didn’t try to persuade him further.

Yang Ye left and returned to Eternal Kingdom.

It was time to put an end to the enmity of the past.

Yang Ye withdrew a transmission stone, and it only took a moment for a voice to come from it, “Brother Yang, you’re still alive! Congratulations!”

Yang Ye asked, “What do you mean?”

The voice replied, “I received word that all the experts of the End World went out in search of you.”

Yang Ye grinned, “You thought I wouldn’t make it back?”

The voice replied, “Indeed.”

Yang Ye shook his head slightly, “Let’s get down to business. Tell me where the Soul Sect is. They have a debt to repay.”

A period of silence ensued, and it went on for around 15 minutes before Yang Ye finally left the spot.

A short while later, he arrived at a mountain range, and he could see it in its entirety from high above.

Yang Ye remained silent for a moment, and then he swung his sword.

Hiss!

It seemed like the entire sky was slashed open. The empty expanse of space there suddenly shook, and then space was sliced open. A pitch black hall appeared before Yang Ye.

The Soul Hall!

Yang Ye hadn’t forgotten how the Soul Sect had bullied him. They had besieged him over and over again, and he’d almost died because of it.

Yang Ye walked toward the hall with his sword in hand, and it didn’t take long for him to arrive before its door. He walked in, but it was completely empty!

Yang Ye frowned from the sight of this.

They’d fled?

Meanwhile, the mysterious person’s voice came from the transmission stone, “You’re too late!”

Yang Ye spoke solemnly, “What do you mean?”

The voice replied, “According to the latest information I received, their sect master has joined the End World, and the rest of their members have scattered into hiding.”

Yang Ye’s face turned gloomy.

Meanwhile, the voice continued, “One more thing. The End World has formed an alliance, the Defiance Alliance. They’ve used all sorts of methods to notify the experts of the entire universe to gather there in the End World. So long as they are at the Destiny Realm, joining the End World will give them the right to cultivate the formidable techniques of Qi Bitian’s era, and they will even be allowed to read the compilation of experience and comprehension from other extraordinary experts…”

The Defiance Alliance?

Yang Ye frowned, “What are they trying to do? Fight Destiny?”

The voice replied, “They mainly want to join forces against Destiny. But I think that their secondary objective may be you.”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

The voice continued, “They have started to converge together, and their influence will definitely be able to bring more experts to them. After all, not just anyone could enter the End World in the past. Yet now, they have lowered the entrance requirements, so many are able to enter that place now… Don’t underestimate them. All of them were once geniuses of their time. None of them are ordinary.”

Yang Ye would naturally not underestimate them. If it hadn’t been for the woman in black’s presence, he would have died that day.

However, trouble was probably coming for him again.

Those fellows had actually joined forces!

Yang Ye thought for a moment and asked, “Weren’t most of the Destiny Realm experts already in the End World? How many more can they gather?”

The mysterious person replied, “The Three Dimensional Universe is huge, and the amount of hidden experts in it are simply impossible to determine. Especially many old geezers from very, very long ago. Take your ancestor, Jian Wudi, for example. If he hadn’t shown himself, there would probably be few in this world who would be aware that he’s alive.”

Yang Ye nodded and left.Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

The voice asked, “Where are you going?”

Yang Ye just shot forward as he spoke, “The End World!”

The owner of the voice was stunned speechless.

Yang Ye wasn’t joking. He arrived at the End Dimension just two hours later.

Yang Ye went over to the teleportation formation which led to the End World. He had indifference on his face as he stabbed his sword into the ground and sat there.

He was just standing on guard there!

He planned to fight them to the end!

The End World.

They were naturally aware of Yang Ye’s arrival.

In an airborne hall, the Divine Abode’s master had a very unsightly expression on his face. Yang Ye really refused to just leave them alone!

Meanwhile, a voice resounded in the hall, “Let him do as he pleases.”

The Divine Abode’s master nodded. It was all they could do for now.

Outside the teleportation formation, Yang Ye just sat there without going inside. It was because he was no match for them in there!

As for the End World, they were clearly afraid of Yang Ye. They were worried that Destiny was with Yang Ye, so they didn’t dare to show themselves!

Actually, the End World was more afraid than Yang Ye! Of course, they weren’t afraid of Yang Ye but the woman in black!

Just like that, a long time passed before a figure suddenly rushed over from afar.

Yang Ye opened his eyes and raised his sword, “Name yourself!”

The figure stopped, “I’m here to join the End World and defy the heavens with all of you!”

Yang Ye frowned slightly, and then his sword shook slightly as he said, “Fuck off! The End World doesn’t accept trash!”

That person before Yang Ye was stunned.
