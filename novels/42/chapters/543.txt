Chapter 544 – Luo Jun’s Death Trap!

Yang Ye put Lag away. He really looked forward to the effect created by the combo of Void Flash and Lag being used together!

Yang Ye gazed at Sheerwing.

The old man in Daoist robes and said, “This was the weapon of a Saber Exalt from many years ago. It’s thin like the wing of a cicada and doesn’t draw blood. Even though its effects can’t compare to Lag, it’s one of the best amongst Artificial Dao Artifacts. Because it’s sharp to the point that it can slice space open with ease. Besides Natural Dao Artifacts, there’s practically nothing that it can’t slice apart. Even Lag is inferior in sharpness when compared to it.”

“This saber will be great for Yuxi!” Yang Ye chuckled and put the saber away.

After that he seemed to have thought of something and glanced apologetically at An Nanjing. He was just about to speak when she said, “Skysplit is all I need. Everything else will only be a burden to me!”

Yang Ye nodded and smiled. “Then I’ll be taking them.”

An Nanjing nodded.

Yang Ye gazed at the old man and said, “Senior Tu, clear them all out. Everything within the World Portrait is mine, so clear everyone else out. Right, don’t kick a few people out. They are my friends.”

The old man nodded, waved his right hand, and the world within the World Portrait instantly changed.

“AH... what’s going on? Eh, what am I doing outside? Fuck! I was just about to obtain a Heaven Rank treasure!”

“Why are we outside? Who did this? My treasures! Let me back in! Let me back in! You motherfucker! Saint Liu Yun!”

“Could it be that someone has obtained Saint Liu Yun’s inheritance and kicked all of us out? Was it An Nanjing or Yang Ye?”

“That person is dead regardless of who it was! Motherfucker! I’ll kill whoever it was for trying to take everything!”

“You intend to kill Yang Ye or An Nanjing? Just look at what a weakling you are. They’d kill you with just a glance.”

Luo Jun had a gloomy expression on his face as he stood in the distance. There were 10 middle aged man in golden armor standing behind him. The aura possessed by those middle aged men was strong like dragons and were so terrifying that others didn’t dare look them in the eye.

They were the renowned leaders of the 10 regiments in the Exalted Han Empire. Every single one of them was an extraordinary expert at the ninth level of the Exalt Realm, and they were experts that had experienced countless slaughters and battles of life and death in order to attain their current accomplishments. It could be said that they were true ninth rank Exalt Realm experts who hadn’t relied on any external sources of strength to attain their current cultivations!

On Luo Jun’s left were four men in dark golden armor. They were the four Grand Commanders of the Souleater Corps, and countless sects throughout the central territory felt terrified from just hearing their name. Every single one of the four Grand Commanders were ninth rank Exalt Realm experts!

There were six more black clothed figures on Luo Jun’s right. The two in the lead were the mysterious Pavilion Masters of the Exalted Han Empire’s Shadow Pavilion and Dark Pavilion. According to rumor, no one besides the Emperor of the Exalted Han Empire had seen their true appearances, and no one knew exactly how strong they were. In any case, everyone just knew that they were two blades in the hands of the Exalted Han Empire’s Emperor!

These blades didn’t just point their edges towards outsiders, they pointed their edges towards the inside as well. They dealt with all those who had ill intent towards the Exalted Han Empire, including the princes of the empire!

Now, these two Pavilion Masters and their respective Vice Pavilion Masters had shown themselves here.

They only had a single target, Yang Ye!

After all those profounders who’d been cleared out from within the World Portrait had vented their anger, they noticed Luo Jun’s forces, and the first thing many did was to increase the distance between them and Luo Jun. That even included the members of the devil race and demon race. Moreover, some profounders had even left right away. What a joke! They didn’t want to be dragged into the battle and suffer misfortune!

“Looks like Luo Jun is determined to annihilate Yang Ye!” Mo Xuan laughed coldly. “Good. Let the humans bite each other. That’s a great thing for our devil race!”

“Be careful or he might kill all of us as well!” Meanwhile, Mo Ke said, “He has summoned so many experts from the imperial household. If he were to attack us now with the forces he possesses at this moment, then we wouldn’t be able to resist at all. So, I suggest that we should retreat first.”

Mo Xuan shook his head and said, “There were many treasures in the ruins, and those treasures are probably in Yang Ye and An Nanjing’s possession right now. Wouldn’t it be a pity if we leave right now? But you’re right, we can’t rival Luo Jun’s current forces, and we must think of a way to overcome this difference. Otherwise, it’s very likely that we’ll be killed here if he arouses killing intent towards us!”

Mo Ke asked. “Should we join forces with the Divine Gold Dragon Clan?”

Mo Xuan hesitated for a moment before he nodded, and then he gazed at the robust man and said, “You should be clearly aware of the situation we’re in right now. If we don’t join forces, then we can only leave empty handed. If we join forces, then perhaps we can take advantage of the situation later. What do you think?”

The robust man hesitated for a moment before he nodded and said, “Alright!” Even though the Divine Gold Dragon Clan was an extremely proud clan, they weren’t a bunch of idiots as well. The robust man had no doubt that Luo Jun’s forces were the strongest amongst all of them, and Luo Jun was human. So, if he aroused killing intent towards them, then all of them would really be killed!

So, he didn’t hesitate at all to agree to Mo Xuan’s suggestion!

Granny Rong who stood by Luo Jun’s side spoke in a low voice when she saw the devil race and demon race join forces. “Mortal Emperor, the devil race and Divine Gold Dragon Clan have joined forces. They’ll probably act against us later. Should we deal with them now?”

Luo Jun glanced at them, and then he shook his head and said, “There’s no need to pay any attention to them. They’re just a bunch of clowns who aren’t capable of doing anything. Just order the members of the Shadow Pavilion and the Dark Pavilion to observe the surroundings well and prevent Yang Ye from escaping from right beneath our noses. Otherwise, I’ll punish all of you!”

“Yes!” Granny Rong left.

Luo Jun took a deep breath and tightened his grip on the Mortal Emperor Sword in his right hand. He was determined to obtain the World Portrait today, and Yang Ye had to die as well. No one could stop him, even the Demon Emperor.

When he thought about the Demon Emperor, Luo Jun looked up into the sky. There was an ancestor of the Exalted Han Empire up there.

High above in the clouds.

Three old men were in a triangular shape while facing each other.

“Luo Tian, based on the situation below, it looks like your grandson intends to eliminate Yang Ye today!” The Grand Elder of the devil race glanced at the white haired old man standing in front of him and said, “But the Demon Emperor would probably not allow it, right?”

Luo Tian said indifferently, “The agreement between our three races is one where the Monarch Realm experts of our races can’t act against the members of the other races. My Exalted Han Empire won’t go against that agreement. If the Demon Emperor stops Jun’er from killing Yang Ye, then it’s the Demon Emperor who broke the agreement. Your devil race wouldn’t stand by idly if the demon race were to break the agreement, right? Of course, if you just watch, then it means that the agreement between our three races isn’t in effect anymore. Since it isn’t in effect, then all of those members of your devil race who’ve come here today can just rest here forever!”

“Are you threatening me?” The Grand Elder of the devil race spoke in a low voice.

Luo Tian said, “When we made the agreement, we agreed that once one of us broke the agreement, the other two races would jointly pursue and kill that person. Grand Elder, you wouldn’t have forgotten about that, right?”

The Grand Elder of the devil race grunted coldly and said, “Of course I do. Don’t worry, if the Demon Emperor dares to violate the agreement, then I’ll definitely uphold the terms of the agreement and stop him. Of course, I’d do the same if your Exalted Han Empire were to violate the agreement!”

Luo Tian laughed coldly and said, “Practically all the elites below the Monarch Realm of my Exalted Han Empire are here. Even if Yang Ye is the Sword Sect’s Founding Ancestor, he would still have to die here today.”

“Nothing is absolute!” The Dragon Emperor chuckled.

Luo Tian glanced at the Dragon Emperor, grunted coldly, and didn’t speak another word.

Within the World Portrait.

Yang Ye gazed at Yin Xuan’er and said, “You’re saying that Luo Jun left with his subordinates after An Nanjing and I were taken away by the old man?”

Yin Xuan’er nodded and said, “If I’m not wrong, then Luo Jun was definitely aware that it was impossible for him to obtain the World Portrait, so he decided to wait outside for you. In other words, Luo Jun’s army or those extraordinary experts of the Exalted Han Empire might be waiting outside. They’re definitely waiting for you right now!” DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“He intends to use numbers against me, huh!” said Yang Ye.

Yin Xuan’er said, “I suggest that you don’t head out there. I know you’re strong and even going against 10 by yourself isn’t a problem. However, there’s a limit to your strength! You’ve made Luo Jun lose so much face before this, so he’ll absolutely not allow you to leave alive. Thus, it’s absolutely the extraordinary experts of the Exalted Han Empire that will be waiting outside for you, and there’ll definitely not be just a few of them. You’ll be walking into a trap if you head out right now, and you’ll have no chance of surviving!”

“Then am I supposed to shrink back and hide here?” Yang Ye laughed. “It would buy me some time, but can I hide forever?”

“Then what’s your plan to deal with Luo Jun?” asked Yin Xuan’er.

Yang Ye shrugged and said, “I don’t have one. I’ll just kill my way out.” He’d obtained the World Portrait, so he intended to return to the southern territory. Of course, he wouldn’t give it to anyone. In any case, his only goal was to prevent Luo Jun from obtaining it.

“You’re a rash idiot!” Yin Xuan’er was quite angry, and she said, “Do you realize that you’re just giving your life away by doing that!?”

Yang Ye smiled and said, “Don’t worry, I won’t give my life away! You and Jianyao leave first. I’ll leave a while later. An Nanjing, you go with them. Many people will definitely be suspicious of them since they’re only leaving now, so your presence will be able to deter those fellows who arouse ill intent towards them.”

An Nanjing glanced at Yang Ye< and then she gazed at Yin Xuan’er and Lu Jianyao. She said, “Let’s go. There’s no need to worry about him. He isn’t someone that courts death.”

The corners of Yang Ye’s mouth twitched a little, and he rolled his eyes.

Yin Xuan’er hesitated for a moment before she removed a golden ring from her hand and passed it to Yang Ye. “There are 12 Gold Guards in here, and five of them are at the ninth rank of the Exalt Realm. The other 7 are at the fifth rank of the Exalt Realm. They should be quite helpful to you.”

Yang Ye was just about to refuse when Yin Xuan’er said, “That’s all the help I can give you. If you refuse and I release all of these fellows while you’re in battle with Luo Jun, then Luo Jun will definitely not let us go. Do you want the Exalted Han Empire to target us?”

Yang Ye smiled bitterly, and then he took the ring and said, “Thank you!”

The old man waited for An Nanjing, Yin Xuan’er, and the others to leave before he said, “Are you really going to head out there just like that?”

Yang Ye said, “What else can I do? I don’t seem to have a choice, right?”

“That’s true!” said the old man.

Around 10 minutes later, Yang Ye appeared before everyone in the outside world.

He was the center of attention!
