Chapter 2260 – Calamity for the God Race!

The teleportation formation was a shortcut to the initial race.

However, the Unfettered One clearly refused to take that shortcut. The method he used was the most direct, and it was to forcefully tear open a path.

As for whether he could succeed, it was something that only he knew.

Meanwhile, the Martial Emperor spoke abruptly, “Leave this place to me!”

Yang Ye was astounded, “Just you?”

The Martial Emperor glanced at him and spoke indifferently, “Can’t I?”

Yang Ye smiled with embarrassment, “Of course, of course you can. Good luck!”

Yang Ye gazed at An Nanjing, and then they vanished into the distance.

At the instant they vanished, the seven Undead Warriors were about to attack, but the Martial Emperor suddenly appeared before them and slapped his palms forward.

Bang!

All seven of them were blasted over 30km away!

Master Tian’s pupils constricted slightly from the sight of this. Because this middle aged man who’d suddenly arrived here wasn’t just slightly strong!

He fell silent for an instant and gazed at the seven Undead Warriors, “Don’t hold back!”

Once he finished speaking, he flashed over to the door of light. Yang Ye and An Nanjing had already brought the others there.

Master Tian and two Undead Warriors stood before Yang Ye’s group!

“You think you can go in?” Master Tian spoke fiercely, “Do you think that’s possible?”

An Nanjing was about to attack when Yang Ye shook his head, and then he pointed his sword at the other experts of the undying race, “If you stop me, I’ll stop them!”

Yang Ye appeared before those members of the undying race, and his powerful sword intent and slaughter intent enveloped them.

“How dare you!” Master Tian howled furiously and was about to attack, but a spear shot through space toward him.

Bang!

An explosion resounded, and then Master Tian was blasted over 1km away. An Nanjing was in front of him, and she glanced indifferently at him while Burning Fury blazed with flames.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye’s sword intent and slaughter intent were stopped by two rays of cold light before they could reach the experts of the undying race!

Those two Undead Warriors appeared in front of Yang Ye.

Yang Ye glanced at them, and then he gazed at Elder Yuan’s group, “Go inside!”

At this moment, Yang Ye had turned their passive position around!

Now, he wasn’t keeping the experts of the undying race busy, they were trying to keep his side busy!

Elder Yuan clearly realized that too, so he nodded and was about to lead the others into the portal. However, he seemed to have thought of something and bowed slightly to Yang Ye, “I will never forget your kindness. I’ll wait for you on the other side.”

His figure shot into the portal once he finished speaking.

The Undead Warriors were about to attack, but Yang Ye’s sword intent enveloped the others from the undying race. So, those Undead Warriors had no choice but to give up on attacking Elder Yuan’s group and gazed at Yang Ye with vigilance.

Elder Yuan went smoothly through the portal, and the others in the group gradually went through as well. It didn’t take long for only Nether Maiden and the others, A’Man, and Situ Tingyun to remain.

Yang Ye closed his eyes slowly, “Go through it!”

Sky Maiden walked over to him and spoke softly, “We’ll be waiting for you on the other side! You must come!”

She entered the portal with the others once she finished speaking.

A’Man walked over to Yang Ye, glanced at the surroundings, and said, “I want to stay and help you, all of us do. However, we know that we’ll only be a burden. You… must come to the other side!”

She didn’t say another word and just entered the portal.

Only the Demonspawn remained.

Yang Ye spoke softly, “While they aren’t weak, they aren’t very strong either. So, please take care of them over there.”

The Demonspawn nodded, “I owe you for this. I’ll take care of your friends. You take care too!”

The Demonspawn entered the portal.

Only the others from the large universe remained now, and they were looking at Yang Ye.

Yang Ye glanced at them. In the end, he gazed at a young woman. She was the patriarch of the sky race, Xiao Qi. She was one of his friends, but she hadn’t chosen to leave with Elder Yuan’s group.

Yang Ye gazed at her, and then he raised his chin at the portal, “Go!”

She walked over to Yang Ye, “M-my people…”

Yang Ye rubbed her head and spoke softly, “Go, take as many as you can.”

She looked up at Yang Ye, and then tears suddenly started rolling down her face. But it only took a moment for her to wipe it off, and then she gazed at her people, “Let’s go! Hurry!”

The experts of the sky race naturally wouldn’t miss such an opportunity and ran toward the portal.

Xiao Qi spoke softly, “Y-You will come too, right?”

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings and smiled, “Perhaps. Enough, go through the portal. Go with Elder Yuan’s group once you go through. Your people charged off without even thinking about you, so I don’t trust them. Stay with Elder Yuan’s group, and they will protect you. If you really can’t let go of your people, then ask Elder Yuan and the others to help you manage them. Understand?”

Xiao Qi nodded, “I understand. I-I’ll be waiting for you on the other side!”

She hugged him for a moment, and then entered the portal.

More and more were leaving.

During this time, the experts from the undying race went through too. Both the people close to Yang Ye and the experts of the undying race had mostly gone through, but the experts of the other races still remained here.

Yang Ye gazed at them, and he saw pleading gazes in their eyes.

They didn’t dare to move without the order from Yang Ye. Because the experts of the undying race were here, and they may die if they moved!

No one here didn’t fear the strength of the Undead Warriors!

Yang Ye pondered deeply for a moment as he gazed at them, and then he said, “Go on!” CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“Thank you!” Countless bowed to Yang Ye, and then they surged madly into the portal.

Bang!

Suddenly, a powerful aura appeared here. Yang Ye looked over, and he saw a group of people rushing over here with Shi Tian in the lead. The people of the god race were behind him. However, Yang Ye didn’t see Ding Shaoyao and Zhi’er.

Shi Tian glanced at the people here and said, “Go in!”

The experts of the god race started rushing forward.

However, Yang Ye suddenly withdrew his slaughter intent and sword intent while An Nanjing returned to his side. Yang Ye gazed at Master Tian and said, “They have nothing to do with me!”

He moved aside with An Nanjing.

At this moment, Shi Tian’s expression became quite unsightly.

Because two Undead Warriors were before the portal, and some experts of the god race had been instantly beheaded upon charging over.

Shi Tian glanced coldly at Yang Ye, and Yang Ye replied indifferently, “What? Bite me!”

“Yang Ye!” The desire to kill flashed through Shi Tian’s eyes.

Yang Ye suddenly pointed his sword at Shi Tian, “You better shut up. Say another word and the undying race won’t have to do anything because I’ll annihilate your god race.”

Shi Tian’s face turned extremely gloomy. He gazed at Yang Ye for a long time, and then he gazed at Master Tian, “We had an agreement…”

Master Tian replied indifferently, “Your agreement with Master Yuan was that we wouldn’t annihilate your god race, but we said nothing about letting your god race through this portal. Of course, I can give you a chance. So long as you kill Yang Ye, we’ll let you through. Alright?”

They wanted to use him to kill Yang Ye!

Shi Tian’s expression grew even more unsightly!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye spoke indifferently, “Shi Tian, wanna give it a try?”

Shi Tian clenched his fists, and his face was terrifyingly gloomy.

A hopeless situation!

At this moment, the god race had been pushed into a hopeless situation!

Kill the undying race?

The god race clearly wasn’t capable of that!

Kill Yang Ye?

Since Yang Ye could force the undying race into such a situation, it proved the strength of Yang Ye’s side. If they targeted Yang Ye, Yang Ye’s forces could annihilate the god race too!

So, the god race was between a rock and a hard place!

“You brought this upon yourselves!” Meanwhile, An Nanjing spoke abruptly.

The relationship between Yang Ye and the god race had been quite good before this, but the god race had chosen to become Yang Ye’s enemy. If the god race hadn’t done that, Yang Ye would have allowed all of them to live right now!

Shi Tian didn’t have the strength to force the undying race to make a compromise, but Yang Ye did.

Everyone of the god race gazed at Shi Tian and waited for him to make a decision.

In the end, he gazed at Yang Ye, “Yang Ye, my god race was at fault, and I hope…”

Yang Ye shrugged, “Patriarch Shi Tian, it’s a difficult situation for us all right now, and it’s why I was willing to help the experts of the other races. But I’m sorry, what does the god race’s fate have to do with me?”

Heartless?

No!

Yang Ye didn’t think he was heartless at all. Because he was absolutely sure that if Shi Tian could kill him, Shi Tian would have done so to get his people through the portal!

Besides that, Yang Ye was a vengeful person.

He would never forget those who were kind to him, but he would also never forget those who had tried to harm him!

Shi Tian took a deep breath and said, “Yang Ye, please do it out of consideration for Shaoyao…”

Yang Ye interrupted Shi Tian again, “She chose the god race.”

He closed his eyes slowly at this point, “If she chose me, I would save the god race, even if I had to die. Of course, she did help me in the past, and I would repay her if she was here. However, it has nothing to do with the god race.”

Meanwhile, Master Tian suddenly said, “Almost all my forces have gone through. Once they have, the teleportation formation will be closed. The god race will be buried with the large universe then!”

Shi Tian’s expression was so unsightly it was simply impossible to describe with words!
