Chapter 2679 – Sausage Slicer!

A long time passed before Yang Ye opened his eyes slowly.

Hot!

That was Yang Ye’s first thought. He immediately jumped to his feet and looked down. He was in a desert.

An extremely huge sun hung high above.

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings and only a scene of desolation was there to greet his eyes.

It was a practically destroyed world!

Yang Ye started walking forward while Past Life remained in his grasp.

He was walking very slowly because he was still very weak, even now. While his body was very powerful, it had been affected by the Past Life Energy, so he was in a very, very bad state right now!

As for the Past Life Energy itself, he had no idea how to use it right now!

On the other hand, he couldn’t use his profound energy at all!

Everything had been sealed off!

Yang Ye looked into the distance and walked, step by step. It was because he saw buildings there, but they were a little far away.

A short while later, Yang Ye suddenly stopped and looked down. There was a corpse by his feet!

A corpse that looked human yet wasn’t entirely human!

Yang Ye pressed his right hand down.

Bang!

The sand around the corpse was instantly blasted away, and the entire corpse was revealed before his eyes.

It was human yet wasn’t. It was much taller than a human!

While the corpse’s body was intact, its aura was gone.

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings and shook his right hand lightly. In an instant, the sand around him was pushed away, and many more corpses appeared around him!

There were around 100 of them!

All of them were resting peacefully!

Yang Ye remained silent for a long time before continuing forward. Finally, he walked out of the desert and arrived before a ruin.

There was a statue before the ruin, and before it was a tablet. On the tablet were a few words.

“Thou shall kneel.”

Kneel!

Yang Ye glanced at the statue, and then he walked around it. Suddenly, something unexpected happened.

The statue suddenly moved!

A huge fist slammed at Yang Ye!

Yang Ye’s expression changed drastically. He tapped the tip of his foot against the ground with the intent of creating distance, but this time, the ground cracked open yet his figure didn’t fly away!

Meanwhile, the fist was before him!

Yang Ye raised his sword and stabbed.

Bang!

His figure was blasted right back into the desert. He was back where he’d been when he just arrived in this world.

Moreover, he was covered in sand!

A long time later, Yang Ye crawled out of the sand.

Once he emerged, his countenance was pale, and his entire right hand was trembling incessantly. He couldn’t even hold his sword!

Now that he’d lost his past cultivation, he realized that his old way of fighting wouldn’t work!

Or it should be said that it didn’t really suit him!

Moreover, now that he couldn’t use his profound energy, Past Life’s strength had declined tremendously. Besides being indestructible, it didn’t have any other ability!

Because he had no profound energy, so it had no Past Life Energy, not even a bit.

It could only be considered as an indestructible sword!

Yang Ye planned to rest for a while, but the status suddenly started walking in his direction.

Every step it took caused the ground to tremble.

Yang Ye closed his eyes slowly. He knew that he had to change the way he fought!

A sword cultivator!

He was a sword cultivator!

Meanwhile, the status slammed its fist at Yang Ye. The world shook before its fist, and countless explosions resounded through the air!

It was a peak Destiny Realm expert!

Suddenly, Yang Ye opened his eyes, and then he turned around and started running!

He was running!

However, the energy in the fist covered the entire area. Even if he wasn’t going head-on against it, he was still affected by its energy.

So, Yang Ye was blasted away once more!

This time, he didn’t even know where he’d gone. All he did know was that he’d been buried beneath the sand.

Moreover, he could sense the space in the surroundings trembling!

The statue was growing closer and closer!

Yang Ye crawled up from the ground again. Meanwhile, the statue was already in front of him. A moment later, its fist slammed down at him.

Yang Ye wiped off the blood on the corner of his mouth, and then he shot backward. He dodged the punch, but he failed to dodge the energy it emanated.

Bang!

Yang Ye was blasted away again!

Despair! Helplessness!

At this moment, Yang Ye experienced despair and helplessness!

If his cultivation was restored, then he could fight this fellow with his flying sword and Sword Domain. But besides a slightly stronger body and his combat instinct, every other aspect of him was no different than an ordinary person!

How could he fight the statue?

It was impossible!

Yang Ye could only dodge incessantly, but he was very well aware that this couldn’t go on for long. Because he had no profound energy, and he didn’t possess an endless healing ability like he used to!

Bang!

Yang Ye was blasted away again, and mouthfuls of blood sprayed from him…Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Once he crashed to the ground, Yang Ye hurried to his feet and ran again.

At a time like this, he couldn’t be bothered about maintaining appearances, nor could he care about the ordinary sword or the Past Life Energy. All of them were useless because the most important thing right now was to stay alive!

This time, Yang Ye ran very fast, and he’d vanished before the statue could even attack him.

The statue was stunned for a while, and then it returned to where it had been. It looked ahead as if it was protecting something.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye laid motionlessly on the desert, far away. His entire body was covered in cracks!

He was in a truly terrible state!

It was the worst in history!

He'd been completely crushed this time!

Yang Ye looked down at Past Life. It didn’t have its terrifying might anymore, and it was like an ordinary piece of metal that was completely useless!

The sword seemed to sense Yang Ye’s thoughts, and it shook while seeming to be saying something!

Yang Ye laughed bitterly, “Alright, it’s not your fault. It’s mine, it’s my fault!”

The sword!

Of course Yang Ye knew that the strength of a sword was normally decided by its wielder. Obviously, he was very weak right now, very, very weak! So, even Past Life was weak with him!

They rose and fell together!

Yang Ye raised Past Life, and he fell silent as he gazed at it.

Silence!

Why am I so weak without profound energy?

It shouldn’t be like that!

Yang Ye fell silent for a long time. In the end, he started walking toward the statue.

However, he stopped a short while later and started walking back!

There was no fear in his heart!

But it didn’t mean he should go seek out death. He was very well aware that if he challenged that statue in his current state, he would probably die!

But if he didn’t do it, how would he leave the World of Past Life?

Besides that, the woman in white had said that Qi Bitian and Tian Xiu were in the outer area of the Four Dimensional Universe, and they weren’t in a very good situation!

There were the experts of the End World too. They wouldn’t spare him and Snowy. Of course, he refused to spare them either!

He had to go forward!

However, he may die if he continued forward!

Yang Ye looked down at his sword and fell silent.

Past Life remained silent as well. It was just a sword!

A dilemma!

Yang Ye just stood there silently for an entire day and night!

He thought of many, many things.

In the end, he realized that the more he thought about it, the more worries he had, and the more he wasn’t able to go forward!

Yang Ye suddenly realized that every time his Sword Dao and Sword Heart improved, he would assume they had no further problems.

He felt they were very pure!

However, every time he was faced with a choice, and especially some difficult choices, he would realize that his Sword Heart wasn’t that pure, and it was still full of cracks!

At this moment, the Unfettered One came to mind.

The Unfettered One had no ties, and so he would never be in a situation like Yang Ye. Because the Unfettered One was unfettered.

However, he had too, too many things to worry about. Like Snowy, Qi Bitian, Su Qingshi and the others… He had too, too many ties. At most times, he couldn’t just think about himself and had to think about the people by his side!

So, his sword was much more inferior when compared to the Unfettered One. Even though it was linked to the amount of time he’d cultivated, it wasn’t an absolute issue.

On the second day, Yang Ye took a step around dusk.

He walked slowly toward the statue.

He’d figured out some things.

Snowy, Erya, and Su Qingshi and the others weren’t his shackles or burdens.

They were his motivation!

Yang Ye wanted to grow stronger, and he wanted to get out of here alive.

He couldn’t cower, and he couldn’t allow himself to die here!

But reality was a cruel thing!

A breath of time later!

Boom!

An explosion resounded, and a figure was blasted away. It was blaster, very, very far away!

Boom!

The figure crashed into the sand and caused a huge wave of sand to surge.

The statue started charging at the figure.

So, under the setting sun, a figure ran toward the distance like a madman. He ran and ran until the statue finally stopped, and only then did he stop and start gasping on the ground!

In the Primordial Pagoda, Erya and Snowy sat on the Ascension Platform. They were looking at Yang Ye, and in Erya’s grasp was a tanghulu.

She licked it and said, “Big Brother Yang is really suffering!”

Snowy nodded in agreement and tilted her head to the side. Erya understood what she meant and moved the tanghulu over for Snowy to lick it.

Snowy licked it for a while before observing Yang Ye again. However, she would touch Erya’s horns from time to time, and Erya would touch Snowy’s cheeks.

They were nice and chubby!

A short while later, Erya seemed to have thought of something and casually picked up the Desolate Axe. She said, “Snowy, can you make this thing stronger? And make all of these marks on it disappear too!”

Snowy glanced at it and nodded to display that it wasn’t a problem!

Erya didn’t consume the 2nd inner core fragment because she couldn’t cultivate right now. She had to be conscious at all times.

She was worried about Yang Ye in his current state!

In the outside world.

Yang Ye walked toward the statue once more, but it didn’t take long for him to be blasted away again!

However, after he fled, it didn’t take long for him to walk toward it once more!

Over and over again!

He didn’t fight back, not even once. He just kept staring at the statue. He was watching its attacks. In the end, he noticed that the statue was actually like a living being and wasn’t just a statue!

Time trickled by!

Two weeks passed by!

This time, Yang Ye arrived before the statue once more. As always, it suddenly raised its hand and slammed a punch at Yang Ye!

At the instant it swung a punch at him, Yang Ye didn’t dodge. He suddenly leaped over to the statue and laughed fiercely, “Try this new move I just created! Sausage Slicer!”

Yang Ye stabbed his sword at the statue’s nether regions.

At this moment, the statue’s fist stopped an inch away from Yang Ye’s head. Even then, Yang Ye was blasted away again.

As for the statue, it suddenly let out a strange shrill cry, and then it held its nether regions with both hands and jumped…
