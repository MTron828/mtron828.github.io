Chapter 812 – I Really Have No Choice!

Translator: InVader

Editor: Conspiracing

Yang Ye was shocked. He hadn’t expected this little girl to actually take him along. Could he even endure the speed of the horse in his current state? No! So, his face instantly warped from the strong winds that struck him upon their ascent into the air!

He wanted to say something, but he couldn’t speak at all! So, he had no choice but to hold tightly onto her and press his face against her back.

He really felt so aggrieved! And curses were surging through his heart!

Fan Meng had never been so close to a man before, so she instantly flared up when she recovered from her shock, “Hey! What are you doing! Quickly let me go or... or I’ll throw you off!”

How could Yang Ye dare to do that? Not only did he ignore her, he even held tighter onto her.

However, he seemed to have wrapped his hands around the wrong position in this moment of desperation, and he felt something soft in his hands. It just so happened then he even squeezed on them.

As soon as he realized what it was, he knew that it was over!

Sure enough....

“AH!!! I’ll kill you!” Fan Meng’s voice resounded through the sky. Right when she drew her sword and was about to strike Yang Ye, a ray of golden light suddenly shot up from below. It was extremely swift to the point even Fan Meng couldn’t detect it. However, Yang Ye had both seen it and sensed it. He didn’t hesitate to hold her and twist their bodies off the horse.

Fan Meng was furious. But she was immediately stunned when she saw the horse exploding into pieces.

“Stop daydreaming! Quickly think of a way to deal with this situation or we’re both dead!” Yang Ye held tightly onto her and couldn’t help but roar furiously when he noticed that she was still stunned. He’d just finished speaking when a powerful gust of wind shot into his mouth, causing him to hurriedly shut it.

Meanwhile, Fan Meng finally recovered from her shock, and she quickly utilized her profound energy to form a pair of wings. But their figures had only just stopped falling when another ray of golden light shot towards them!

It was extremely swift, and the energy it contained was extraordinarily terrifying. Fan Meng merely took a single glance at it before she knew that she was absolutely incapable of resisting it!

At this moment, her face turned ghastly pale!

“Pour your profound energy into your sword and enhance it with sword intent!” Yang Ye suddenly grabbed Fan Meng’s hand which held her sword and shouted.

While she was puzzled, she still did as he said. Because she had no other choice right now. As soon as she poured her profound energy and sword intent into her sword, the golden ray of light was just 3 inches away from her.

Suddenly, she felt her hand move, and then the gold light stopped!

A moment of silence ensued, and then an explosion resounded as the golden light exploded apart. Moreover, the aftershock from the explosion blasted both of them down from midair.

...

There was a huge tree on the ground below, and a man who held a longbow in his hand was frowning, “How could that be possible? That little girl is only at the low rank of the Spirit Realm. Even if she possesses 4th level sword intent, it’s still impossible for her to stop my arrow. This is quite strange.”

He remained silent on the spot for a short while, and then he flashed over to the position Yang Ye and Fan Meng descended to.

At this moment, Yang Ye and Fan Meng were in quite bad shape. They didn’t die from the fall because they fell into a forest, and the trees had slowed down their fall. Of course, it wasn’t pleasant. Especially for Yang Ye because he was at the bottom when both of them crashed to the ground.

His current physical body wasn’t the same as it used to be, and he almost lost his life from the fall. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

This won’t do! I must recover as soon as possible, or I’ll die sooner or later! The corners of Yang Ye’s mouth twitched. At this moment, he didn’t even have the strength to move a muscle.

Suddenly, he felt coldness come from his throat. He opened his eyes and saw that Fan Meng had placed her sword against his throat.

“Who exactly are you!?” Fan Meng’s eyes were filled with excitement and happiness, “That... that strike earlier seemed to have struck the weakest point on that golden ray of light, and then... and then.... I don’t know how to describe it. You... you describe it....” She seemed to be too excited and wasn’t able to speak smoothly.

Yang Ye said, “Can you put your sword down first?” She really keeps raising her sword at all times....

Fan Meng replied, “Tell... tell me the truth. Why exactly did you come to our Fan Clan? Oh I know!” When she spoke up to this point, she withdrew her sword and came close to Yang Ye before she grinned, “You definitely like my older sister, so you concealed your strength and came to our clan to approach her, right? You don’t have to say anything. I’m sure that it’s definitely the reason.”

Yang Ye was quite stunned.

Meanwhile, Fan Meng suddenly patted him on the shoulder, “You know, I’m the closest to my big sister. So long as I speak on your behalf, then it’ll simply be beyond easy for you to pursue her. However, you... you have to teach me that move you used just now....”

Yang Ye was quite amused when he heard this. He knew that while what he did just now seemed very simple, a sword cultivator would definitely realize that it wasn’t simple at all. Obviously, the little girl before him had taken him to be an expert. While she seemed to be careless, she wasn’t stupid at all, and she was actually quite cunning!

Yang Ye said, “Let’s put that aside for now. That fellow who’s pursuing you will definitely not give up. It’s best for us to leave this place as soon as possible!”

Fan Meng waved her hand and spoke heroically, “You’re so strong, so what would we have to fear? You can just kill him when he gets here! I guarantee that I’ll praise you in front of my big sister!”

“Can you please take a look at what sort of state I’m in right now? I can’t even move! How am I supposed to kill him? I think I’d be the one who’s killed!” Yang Ye really wanted to slap her flying because she was really too silly!

“Right....” She sized him up and said, “Then... then what should we do? I... I’ll definitely be unable to escape if I bring you along!”

“Then leave yourself!” Yang Ye spoke calmly.

“Isn’t that... not right?” Fan Meng was quite embarrassed. After all, Yang Ye had saved her life just now.

Yang Ye said, “It doesn’t matter. You’ll definitely have a chance to escape if you leave by yourself; you might not have a chance if you take me along!”

“You... you are the one who said that....” She spoke softly.

Yang Ye nodded and said, “Leave quickly. It’ll be too late if you still don’t act!”

Fan Meng nodded, and then she turned around and ran away. Yang Ye shook his head when he saw that, and then he withdrew some top-grade energy stones and swallowed them before starting to absorb the energy within them.

He didn’t blame her because there was no relationship between them, so how could she possibly allow herself to fall into a hopeless situation for his sake?

Suddenly, Fan Meng returned to Yang Ye. She didn’t speak a single word and just carried him on her back before fleeing towards the distance.

Yang Ye was stunned for quite some time, and then he asked, “Why did you come back?”

She replied, “You saved me earlier, and I would really feel regretful if I just allowed you to be killed. I heard that not having a clear mind is bad for the Sword Dao!”

Yang Ye fell silent for a long time and said, “Did you learn the Sword Dao on your own or has someone been teaching you?”

She spoke in quite an aggrieved tone, “While our clan is quite wealthy, it isn’t capable of hiring a formidable sword cultivator. Moreover, the Ancient Sword School refuses to accept me. So, I learned everything on my own or asked my big sister for guidance. But she doesn’t know much about the Sword Dao as well.”

He asked, “Why were you refused by the Ancient Sword School?”

She explained, “Their minimum requirement is the 6th level of sword intent, and that person can’t be older than 16 years old. I’m already 16 now. So if I can’t join in this year, I’ll never have another chance. If I can’t join the Ancient Sword School, then I won’t be able to help my big sister. At that time, she’d definitely be forced to marry that scoundrel from the Ye Clan!”

Yang Ye shook his head, and then he rubbed her head and said, “I’ll teach you then!”

“Really?” Fan Meng seemed to be pleasantly surprised.

Yang Ye nodded, “Of course. But you can’t tell your older sister!”

“Why?” She was quite puzzled.

Yang Ye pondered deeply for a moment and said, “Even you’ve realized that I’m heavily injured right now, and my strength hasn’t recovered. If my enemies find out about the state that I’m in, then they’ll definitely come to kill me. So, I can only teach you in secret!” Actually, he wasn’t lying. He hadn’t forgotten that Lu Yuanhao was in the Outer Heavens. If Lu Yuanhao found out that he was still alive, then he would be utterly incapable of fighting Lu Yuanhao with his current strength!

“You were definitely an extremely formidable figure in the past, right?” Fan Meng’s voice carried a trace of excitement as if she’d found a treasure trove.

He replied, “I was just ordinary!”

“We’re you as formidable as Lu Wan’er? You know, she’s at the Monarch Realm, and she even possesses Heaven Rank sword intent. I even heard that she possesses the Void Sword Physique. Even though I don’t know what that is, it seems to be very formidable. Besides that, she even defeated numerous geniuses of the Ancient Sword School.” When she spoke about Lu Wan’er, Fan Meng’s voice actually carried adoration.

“Lu Wan’er?”

Yang Ye smiled yet stayed silent. Actually, he wanted to see Lu Wan’er as well. However, the state he was in right now didn’t allow it.

“Right! Our clan wouldn’t have to suffer being threatened by the Ye Clan if I was that strong, and my big sister wouldn’t have to marry someone she doesn’t like.” Fan Meng seemed to be slightly sad.

Yang Ye said, “There’s no rush. You can take it slow!”

He suddenly frowned when he spoke up to this point, and then he said, “Stop!”

Even though she was puzzled, Fan Meng still stopped.

At this moment, Yang Ye had recovered a little of his ability to move after nurturing himself with spirit energy. So he turned around and looked towards the distance, “He has caught up!”

As soon as Yang Ye finished speaking, a man who wore a black embroidered rope and carried an ink black longbow appeared within their fields of vision.

“The Divine Archer, Liu Wufeng!” Fan Meng’s face turned pale when she saw him.

Yang Ye frowned as well because the man was at the low rank of the Exalt Realm, and that was an entire realm of cultivation higher than Fan Meng!

Yang Ye shook his head, took Fan Meng’s hand, and then walked towards Liu Wufeng as he said, “I’ve been waiting for you!”

At the same time, he said in his heart, I have no choice but to put on a show this time!

He was waiting for me? The man who was about to attack was stunned when he heard Yang Ye.
