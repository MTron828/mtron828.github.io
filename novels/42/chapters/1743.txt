Chapter 1744 - Weeds Should Be Pulled Out By The Roots!

This scene had occurred too abruptly, and it was to the point that some here were still stunned by it.

It was the same even for Yang Ye who was fighting against those beams of light.

Yang Lianshuang attacked Yang Xiao’s group?

What’s she doing?

Meanwhile, a few dozen bolts of lightning appeared here, and they shot into the walls beside Yang Ye.

Boom!

In an instant, the entire Sky Prison shattered.

As soon as it shattered, the experts imprisoned on the 1st and 2nd hadn’t fled. They went over to Yang Lianshuang and bowed, “Master!”

Yang Lianshuang nodded slightly, and they instantly went to stand behind her.

Meanwhile, Yang Xiao suddenly said, “Yang Lianshuang, what’s the meaning of this?!”

She replied indifferently, “What’s the meaning of this? Yang Xiao, do you think I’m a three year old child? Kill Yang Ye and I’ll be the successor of the Yang Clan? If I’m not wrong, the next person you eliminate after Yang Ye will be me!”

Yang Xiao gazed at her and didn’t say a word.

Meanwhile, Yang Lianshuang gazed at Yang Ye and said, “I’m really surprised that you came to save me. I thought that you would flee after finding out that a 6th stage True Realm expert of the Yang Clan has shown himself. However, you didn’t, and you even returned to the Yang Clan to save me. I’m really surprised! But that is good too. Since you’re here, then let’s put an end to our enmity with the Yang Clan!”

Yang Xiao suddenly said, “Yang Lianshuang, are you trying to rebel against the clan?”

Yang Lianshuang gazed at Yang Xuan, “You’re right. That’s exactly what I intend.”

As soon as she finished speaking, she waved her right hand, and then seven of the old men behind Yang Xiao went over to her. At the same time, Phecda City shook violently before countless figures flashed out from all over the city. In the end, all of them converged behind Yang Lianshuang.

There were a few thousand of them. There were actually seven True Realm experts amongst them, and one of them was even a 4th stage True Realm expert while two more were at the 3rd stage, and the rest were at the 1st and 2nd stage!

Besides that, the rest were mostly Zenith Realm experts!

All of them supported Yang Lianshuang, and they were her trusted subordinates in the Yang Clan!

Something worth mentioning was that Yang Xuan was standing behind Yang Lianshuang as well.

At this moment, the Yang Clan was divided into two sides!

Yang Xiao glanced at the people behind Yang Lianshuang and spoke coldly, “What? All of you intend to rebel with her?”

Meanwhile, an old man behind Yang Lianshuang stepped forward. He glanced at Yang Xiao and said, “Patriarch, Lianshuang is a peerless genius of our Yang Clan. The Yang Clan will definitely thrive and prosper under her leadership. So, please give up your position?”

“Patriarch, please abdicate!” Countless behind Yang Lianshuang spoke in unison.

They were forcing him to abdicate his position!

Yang Xiao’s face was calm. He gazed at Yang Lianshuang and said, “Needless to say, you’re not just strong, you’re very skilled in scheming. To be honest, if you didn’t do this, I wouldn’t even know that so many people in the Yang Clan support you!”

Yang Lianshuang looked Yang Xiao in the eyes, “I think I’m more suited to be the patriarch than you. So, abdicate and I’ll allow your family and supporters to live. If you resist until the end, then trust me, you and everyone who supports you will die.”

Yang Xiao spoke indifferently, “If all of us die, then even if you obtain the Yang Clan, it’ll just be a crippled Yang Clan!”

Yang Lianshuang took a step forward and said, “So long as I’m there, the Yang Clan will prosper!”

Yang Xiao gazed at Yang Lianshuang for a long time and said, “A woman has never been the patriarch of the Yang Clan in the past, and it won’t happen in the future.”

Yang Lianshuang closed her eyes slowly, “Since you refuse to abdicate, then die!”

She vanished on the spot once she finished speaking.

At the moment she vanished, a bolt of lightning instantly flashed.

Bang!

An instant later, Yang Xiao was blasted over 1km away. Meanwhile, Yang Lianshuang suddenly stretched out her right hand and clenched it slowly.

Crackle!

The sky dimmed down, and then a huge pool of lightning appeared in the city above the city. At the same time, a huge bolt of lightning suddenly shot down from within the pool of lightning. It pierced through space and arrived above Yang Xiao.

Yang Xiao’s expression changed slightly. He stomped his right foot down and shot up into the sky. When he arrived around 1m away from the lightning, he overlapped his palms and slapped them forward.

Boom!

The entire city shook before the might of this attack, and the bolt of lightning instantly exploded apart and transformed into sparks that rained down from the sky.

After that, Yang Xiao immediately gazed at Yang Lianshuang, and then he stretched out his right hand and grasped it in her direction.

Bang!

The space around her suddenly collapsed, and then explosions resounded incessantly within the black hole. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Around three breaths of time later, that expanse of space returned to normal.

Yang Lianshuang was still standing there, and she wasn’t injured at all.

Yang Xiao’s eyes instantly narrowed at the sight of this, and Yang Ye frowned as well. Because even he didn’t know how Yang Lianshuang had defended herself against that attack.

Meanwhile, Yang Lianshuang took a step forward, and then bolts of lightning surged out from her. They flickered incessantly around him, and every single one of them contained extremely terrifying strength.

An extremely solemn expression covered Yang Xiao’s face.

Meanwhile, Yang Lianshuang vanished on the spot, and she was in front of Yang Xiao when she appeared again. After that, she slapped her palm in his direction, and her palm flickered with lightning.

Yang Xiao would naturally not dodge. At this moment, everyone was watching, so he couldn’t lose, nor could he take a step back. As soon as he took a step back, his prestige as the patriarch would definitely decline tremendously.

Take it head-on!

Yang Xiao slammed his fist forward.

Boom!

As soon as their attacks collided, space in a huge area shook violently, and then cracks appeared all around them. As for Yang Lianshuang and Yang Xiao, they were pushed backwards repeatedly.

However, Yang Lianshuang suddenly made a chopping motion with both her hands while her figure was being pushed back.

Hiss!

A bolt of black lightning flashed out from before her and instantly arrived in front of Yang Xiao.

Yang Xiao was shocked, and he hurriedly slammed his fist forward.

Boom!

An explosion resounded, and then Yang Xiao was blasted 3km away. Meanwhile, Yang Lianshuang had stopped herself, and she just suddenly appeared before Yang Xiao and tapped her finger forward.

A bolt of lightning immediately appeared on the tip of her finger, and then it grew and enveloped Yang Xiao in just a moment.

Boom!

A thunderclap resounded, and Yang Xiao was blasted another 3km back.

Meanwhile, Yang Lianshuang stretched out her right hand and pressed her palm downwards, “Descend!”

Crackle! Crackle!

As soon as she finished speaking, the sound of lightning and thunderclaps resounded from the pool of lightning, and then countless bolts of lightning rained down from it like a storm. All of them were aimed at Yang Xiao.

They were extremely swift, and it only took less than a breath of time for them to arrive right above Yang Xiao!

However, Yang Xiao’s reaction was swift. When the rain of lightning arrived above him, a terrifying aura suddenly swept out from him, and then a spear appeared in his grasp. After that, the spear was accompanied by countless spear images as it enveloped the lightning.

Rumble!

Explosions resounded incessantly in the sky above the city, and the entire city shook along with them!

Yang Ye gazed at Yang Lianshuang and Yang Xiao, and he had an extremely solemn expression on his face.

He was naturally able to discern that both Yang Lianshuang and Yang Xiao hadn’t gotten serious until now, and under such circumstances, their strength was still so terrifying.

Yang Xiao’s strength wasn’t that shocking. He was a 4th stage True Realm expert, and he was one who’d made a name for himself a very long time ago.

But Yang Lianshuang was quite terrifying!

After all, she wasn’t even 30!

Why are all the women I know so terrifying? Yang Ye couldn’t help but feel depressed. Amongst the women he knew like An Nanjing and that woman in a red dress… All of them possessed extremely heaven defying strength!

Boom!

Suddenly, a loud explosion dragged Yang Ye’s mind back to reality. He looked towards the distance, and he saw that Yang Xiao and Yang Lianshuang had split apart. They were 3km away from each other.

Yang Lianshuang’s face was calm, but Yang Xiao’s face was quite unsightly.

Meanwhile, Yang Lianshuang said, “Yang Xiao, if this is the extent of your strength, then I have to say that I’m quite disappointed.”

Yang Xiao glanced at Yang Lianshuang’s group, and then he suddenly chuckled, “Yang Lianshuang, do you think I never expected you to rebel against me? All of this was within my expectations, and I needed this to find out who within the Yang Clan isn’t loyal before dealing with all of them in one go!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he waved his right hand.

In an instant, the space in the surroundings shook violently, and then 20 middle aged men in violet armor appeared.

All of them were 3rd stage True Realm experts!

Yang Lianshuang spoke solemnly, “The Sentinel Guard!”

Yang Ye gazed at her with a puzzled expression, “The Sentinel Guard?”

She glanced at him and said, “The mysterious army of the Yang Clan which I told you about. Only three people can mobilize them.”

She gazed at Yang Xiao and continued, “20 3rd stage True Realm expert. Haha! Yang Xiao, you’ve even summoned the final trump card of the Yang Clan. Looks like you’re determined to eliminate us!”

Yang Xiao glanced coldly at Yang Lianshuang and Yang Ye, “All of you are going to die today.”

Yang Lianshuang gazed at Yang Ye, “How many can you fight?”

Yang Ye glanced at them, and then he thought for a moment before he replied, “I’m weak, so I’ll just fight one of them. Hey, what’s with that gaze? Alright, two. Three! Three! I really can’t fight more. I’ll run if you make me fight more.”

Yang Xiao suddenly chuckled, “Yang Ye, the Sentinel Guard has 23 members, but there are only 20 here. Do you know where the last three are?”

Yang Ye gazed at Yang Xiao, and then he slowly clenched his left hand.

“Yes!” Yang Xiao smiled, “You’ve guessed correctly. They’ve gone to the Merak System. Weeds should be pulled out by the roots, right?”
