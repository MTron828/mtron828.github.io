Chapter 2759 – Giving Orders to the Universe!

Ding Shaoyao immediately took action.

Sending orders to the universe!

If it were in the past, it would be a joke. Yet now, a single order from Universe City could be sent to the entire universe in a short amount of time.

In the air, the woman grinned as she gazed at Yang Ye, and then she looked down. She was like a god looking down on the living.

Yang Ye didn’t say anything and just left.

It was pointless to say anything now!

She didn’t attack Yang Ye either. She shot a glance to the lower right, revealed a grin that seemed to carry deep meaning, and then left.

Just like that, she vanished in the sky while countless watched.

At the direction she’d looked at earlier, an ethereal shadow soundlessly condensed into form.

It was the mysterious expert from the End World.

The mysterious expert looked in the direction she’d left toward and fell silent.

Shu Wubian and the others were by his side.

Shu Wubian looked into the sky with indifference on her face, “It’s her!”

The mysterious expert nodded.

Shu Wubian said, “She’s even more unfathomable now.”

The mysterious expert remained silent.

Zuo Mu and the others were looking in the same direction as well.

Destiny!

That woman was the strongest form of Destiny!

Even though it had just been a clone of hers, their hearts had trembled before that glance of hers.

She was unfathomable like the boundless universe.

That was how she felt to them!

A short while later, the mysterious expert said, “Her target is the Good Sprite and Evil Beast too. We can’t allow them to fall into her hands. Otherwise, we won’t have a chance.”

Shu Wubian spoke indifferently, “Shall we act now?”

The mysterious expert shook his head, “Let them exhaust their strength for now, and we’ll attack when they are at their weakest.”

Meanwhile, Zuo Mu suddenly asked, “Will the Three Dimensional Universe be destroyed?”

The mysterious expert glanced at him and replied, “If Destiny stops guarding that space, then they won’t be able to protect this universe!”

Zuo Mu fell silent.

A short while later, all of them vanished.

Universe City.

In the hall, all the experts led by Yang Ye had extremely solemn expressions on their faces.

Yang Ye spoke solemnly, “I’m sure you witnessed everything. So, I won’t say anything else. Will you protect this place or not?”

“Yes!” An old man suddenly stepped forward.

They gazed at him, and he spoke solemnly, “We have no way out. If we leave, the entire Three Dimensional Universe will be finished. Or to explain it in a more selfish manner, the Three Dimensional Universe is our territory now, and it’s our final territory. Because we can’t escape this Three Dimensional Universe, nor do we have the strength to do so!”

They nodded to display their agreement.

They definitely had to protect the place, and they had to protect it to the death.

Because if they chose to flee, Yang Ye would definitely leave. At that time, they would die a worse death. Conversely, if they chose to stay, they would have a better chance at winning with Yang Ye’s help!

All of them had lived for countless years, so they understood everything clearly!

If they left and Yang Ye chose to stand by idly, then all of them would die!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye said, “Since we are of the same mine, let’s do this! Send word to the universe for all Destiny Realm experts to assist us. They can choose to refuse, my Universe City must keep a record of them. Those who refuse will be prohibited from entering Eternal Kingdom for life. I won’t force anyone to help, but they can dream of ever coming here.”

Yang Ye wasn’t someone who liked to force others, and his attitude was very clear. He welcomes those who wished to help, and those who didn’t could choose not to. However, they could dream about reaping the rewards once the battle was over.

The Destiny Realm experts cared about Universe City because the spirit energy here was effective toward them, of course. The spirit energy in other places couldn’t satisfy the needs of a Destiny Realm expert, and it could be said that they had to come here if they wanted to grow stronger.

The others agreed with Yang Ye’s decision.

If people couldn’t fight and go through the difficult times with them, why should those people share in the rewards of their efforts?

A short while later, orders were sent from Universe City.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye, Jian Wudi, and all the other peak Destiny Realm experts left Universe City and went up into outer space. They saw some eyes in the distant reaches of space!

Living beings that didn’t belong to the Three Dimensional Universe!

Destiny had destroyed the nine layers of space with a swing of her sword. Now, there was no barrier between the Three and Four Dimensional Universes. It could be said that the Three Dimensional Universe was fully revealed before the Four Dimensional Universe!

However, those eyes were clearly afraid of something and didn’t dare to come down here.

Yang Ye knew that those existences feared Destiny, and once they understood what Destiny was planning, it would be the moment they entered the Three Dimensional Universe!”

“They are very strong!” Meanwhile, Jian Wudi spoke solemnly, “They are at the peak of the Destiny Realm at least. Our forces may be unable to stop them!”

Yang Ye nodded. He’d fought those eyes in the past, and the joint forces of An Nanjing and himself hadn’t even been able to kill one. Of course, An Nanjing and him didn’t have to fear them now!

However, the other Destiny Realm experts of Universe City didn’t have a good chance against them!

Jian Wudi gazed at Yang Ye, “What is your plan?”

Yang Ye replied softly, “I don’t have one! If they attack the Three Dimensional Universe, all the living beings of this universe will die. No one will survive. So, if you want to protect everything you have, the only way is to fight!”

Jian Wudi nodded, “Then we shall!”

Yang Wu smiled, “Our luck is pretty bad! My Martial Sky Clan just entered the world again, and we’ve encountered something like this!”

The Past Life Clan’s patriarch chuckled, “Actually, it isn’t entirely bad. If we’re able to overcome this danger, it’ll be like a form of rebirth for all our clans.”

Yang Ye nodded and smiled, “Don’t be too pessimistic. In any case, we just have to fight! Don’t think about anything else!”

The others smiled.

Suddenly, a figure shot over from the distant sky.

Jian Wudi and the others were about to attack when Yang Ye hurriedly stopped them. He gazed at the figure, and it didn’t take long for that figure to arrive before him!Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Yin Yang Goddess!

Her countenance was quite pale, and there was some anxiety on it.

Yang Ye was quite surprised. What the heck happened to her?

She gazed at Yang Ye, “That woman appeared!”

Yang Ye glanced at her with a strange look in his eyes, “Did you encounter her?”

She replied solemnly, “She glanced at me!”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

Yin Yang Goddess shook her head, “She didn’t attack me, but she looked at me with disregard. She disregarded me!”

Her face was rather ferocious when she spoke up to this point!

Yang Ye, “You can attack her if you don’t like it!”

Yin Yang Goddess gazed at Yang Ye, “I’m no match for her!”

Yang Ye felt speechless. If you’re no match for her, then isn’t it good that she disregarded you? Do you want her to insist on killing you?”

Meanwhile, Yin Yang Goddess suddenly said, “Did she come for you?”

Yang Ye nodded.

Yin Yang Goddess asked, “She didn’t kill you?”

Yang Ye’s face darkened, and then he pointed upward, “Do you see that?”

She shot a glance upward and nodded, “I see.”

Yang Ye spoke seriously, “We need more help now, so stay and help us, alright?”

Yin Yang Goddess didn’t refuse, but she didn’t say anything in response either.

Yang Ye knew he had a chance.

Yang Ye hurriedly added, “Senior, you don’t have anywhere to go now anyway, so why don’t you stay in Universe City. Of course, you can leave whenever you want.”

She glanced at him and said, “Alright.”

Yang Ye grinned when he heard this.

Yin Yang Goddess wasn’t an ordinary Destiny Realm expert, so it was a great thing to have her join Universe City!

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts and glanced at the others, “All of you head back!”

Jian Wudi frowned slightly, “Where are you doing?”

Yang Ye looked up, “I’m going to go have a look!”

Jian Wudi shook his head, “That’s too risky!”

Yan Wu and the others hurriedly nodded. Yang Ye was like their pillar of support, and if something were to happen to him, everything would be over!

Yang Ye smiled, “Don’t worry, I won’t be rash, and they can’t make me stay if I decide to leave.”

Jian Wudi was about to say something but Yang Ye spoke first, “It’s fine, I know what I’m doing!”

Jian Wudi said, “The others can head back. I’ll go with you.”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and didn’t refuse.

Yin Yang Goddess suddenly said, “I’m coming too!”

Yang Ye gazed at her, and she said, “I’m really curious about those eyes too, and I want to have a look. I can, right?”

Yang Ye smiled, “Of course!”

Just like that, the three of them shot up into outer space.

Yan Wu and the others returned to the city.

At the center of Universe City, Ding Shaoyao led Erya, Snowy, and An Nanjing behind Chen Dao’zi to an empty space.

Snowy and Erya hadn’t gone with Yang Ye because Snowy had to help Chen Dao’zi with the formation. Of course, in order to keep Snowy safe, practically all the Destiny Realm experts in the city were on guard in the surroundings.

Besides that, Erya and An Nanjing were personally protecting her too!

Snowy was the most important right now, and no one would allow anything to happen to her!

Chen Dao’zi withdrew a pitch black plate, and he spun it. A moment later, a huge circle of blue light appeared in the empty area, and there were countless threads moving within the circle.

Chen Dao’zi gazed at Ding Shaoyao, “I’m going to perfect the formation now. Ask her to give me spirit energy, the more the better!”

Ding Shaoyao nodded slightly, and then she gazed at Snowy and smiled, “Little fellow, it’s up to you now!”

Snowy blinked, withdrew a black gourd, and then passed the gourd to Chen Dao’zi.

It was the gourd she’d taken from the mysterious expert from the End World, and there was a huge amount of spirit energy within it!

Chen Dao’zi took the gourd and glanced at it. A moment later, his hand trembled because there was so much spirit energy in it.

Suddenly, Snowy looked to the side. At practically the exact same moment, Erya stood in front of Snowy. At the same time, over 20 Destiny Realm experts appeared in front of them.

All of them acted like they were facing a formidable opponent!

A woman had appeared there.
