Chapter 1463 – Kindness Is A Mistake!

He had to save them!

That was a huge problem. If it was before the pearl, then he could have chosen to refuse. Yet now, he had to save them no matter what. After all, the Primordial Pagoda had taken her pearl!

But the problem was, how would he save them?

Once the formation was activated, he would be blasted into bits before he even got close to the wall!

Yang Ye remained silent for an instant, and then he said, “Let me think of a way, alright?”

As soon as he finished speaking, she immediately released her grip on his shoulder. Obviously, she was willing to give him time.

Yang Ye immersed his consciousness into his body, and then he started talking with the Primordial Pagoda.

“Brother, you’ve taken her pearl, so you can’t just stand by idly! Think of a way to help her....” The Primordial Pagoda didn’t answer.

Yang Ye’s face darkened, and then he said, “You can do nothing if you want. Just return the pearl to her. Then we don’t have to do anything.”

He still received no reply.

Yang Ye tried to take the pearl. However, it just wouldn’t come out of the Primordial Pagoda. Obviously, the Primordial Pagoda did it.

Yang Ye’s face was quite unsightly. This fellow took the compensation but refuses to do anything. How shameless!No matter what he tried, the Primordial Pagoda refused to answer him. In the end, Yang Ye had no choice but to give up on gaining help from the Primordial Pagoda, and he went to look for Little Sky.

She gazed at the symbols for a long time, and then she spoke seriously, “You should be able to destroy it once you attain the Deity Realm.”

As soon as she finished speaking, she ran back into the Primordial Pagoda.

Yang Ye’s figure stiffened on the spot. The Deity Realm? I know I can do that at the Deity Realm, but the problem is that I’m only a Voider right now!I’m still two realms of cultivation away from the Deity Realm!

Yet now, he had to save those people. After all, he’d taken the pearl from her. So, it was unacceptable if he refused to save them now. Moreover, she would definitely not let him go.

But how would he save them?

Fortunately, the heavens help those who try. Yang Ye finally thought of a way that wasn’t really a way to deal with the formation.

Yang Ye went over to the mountain wall. He gazed at the symbols for a long time, and then he pressed the index and middle finger on his right hand together. He waved it slightly, and a strand of sword energy shot forward from the tip of his fingers. It was extremely swift and instantly struck the circle of symbols.

Bang!

A beam of light shot out from the mountain wall and instantly destroyed Yang Ye’s sword energy. At the same time, countless beams of light surged out incessantly like a storm. Moreover, a dense expanse of such beams shot up from the village as well, and they shot towards Yang Ye.

Yang Ye’s eyelids twitched, and then he told Little Sky to bring the ice casket out. After that, he hid within it.

Bang! Bang! Bang!

Numerous explosions resounded.

Around an hour later, Yang Ye sat up in the casket. At this moment, the circle of symbols had returned to normal. Yang Ye fell silent for an instant, and then he flicked another strand of sword energy towards the circle of symbols.

After that, he hurriedly laid back down in the casket.

Meanwhile, the formation was activated again, and then countless beams of light appeared.

Once everything returned to normal again, Yang Ye sat up again, and then he flicked another strand of sword energy over to activate the formation. After that, he laid back down into the casket again.

He was exhausting its energy!

The method Yang Ye had come up with was to exhaust the energy within the formation!

The formation was an inanimate object, and there would be a time when all the spirit energy within it was exhausted. Especially this formation, it definitely exhausted a tremendous amount of spirit energy. So, Yang Ye intended to exhaust all the spirit energy within it, and once it was fully exhausted, the formation would be useless.

Needless to say, this method was quite shameless. Moreover, it exhausted a huge amount of time. However, it couldn’t be helped. It was the only method he could think of. Because his strength couldn’t resist the might of the formation at all.

Actually, he was probably the only one capable of utilizing such a method. Because he had the ice casket, and it could resist the attacks from the formation. Otherwise, if it was anyone else, then unless that person’s strength was on par with the person that created the formation, trying to go head-on against it was.... In any case, Yang Ye felt that even the rock titans of Rock Mountain wouldn’t be able to resist the insane barrage of attacks from the formation!

But the ice casket could!

Moreover, the most terrifying part was that he wasn’t able to feel the attacks at all while he laid within the casket! He didn’t even feel the slightest shaking!

Its defenses were too terrifying!

At this moment, he grew even more curious about Little Tian’s identity and background. She knew a huge number of things, a very huge number. Moreover, she could gain information about anyone she wanted to gain information about. That was even more terrifying than the defensive capabilities of the ice casket!

Fortunately, there was something wrong with her ability, and she could only obtain some information. Otherwise, it would be even more terrifying. Because anyone who stood before her would seem completely translucent in her eyes.

The most terrifying part was that the demon beasts gave her face. Even the proud Ancient Emperor Python gave her face. After all, that fellow hadn’t chosen to submit even before the Primordial Pagoda! However, she’d merely spoken a few words and made it submit!

No matter what, he felt that forming a good relationship with Little Sky was definitely not a bad decision.

There were no further explosions in the outside word, so Yang Ye sat up once more and gazed at the circle of symbols. At this moment, the symbols had dimmed down slightly. Yang Ye was delighted by the sight of it because he knew that his plan was working.

Actually, he was still quite worried before this. He was worried that the formation had something which could ceaselessly provide it with spirit energy. If that was the case, then he would be in trouble. Fortunately, the formation wasn’t like that. In other words, he just had to continue exhausting the energy it had, and then it would be destroyed.

When he thought up to this point, Yang Ye flicked another strand of sword energy towards the mountain wall. Just like before it was obliterated before it could even strike the circle of symbols.

Yang Ye hurriedly hid within the casket when he saw that.

Rumble!

Explosions resounded incessantly in the world outside. Actually, all the explosions were caused by the beams of light that were striking the ice casket. However, Yang Ye wasn’t able to feel the collision at all, and he could only feel slight vibrations when he tried to observe carefully.

At this moment, Yang Ye felt that the Celestial Demon Hegemon Body was nothing before the ice casket. The only sad thing was that his physical strength wasn’t sufficient, so he still couldn’t lift the casket. Otherwise, if he could use it in battle, then a single swing would definitely smash his opponent!

It was definitely a powerful weapon to crush his opponents!

Around an hour later, Yang Ye sat up again. At this moment, the circle of symbols was even dimmer.

Yang Ye was delighted. He knew that the spirit energy within it was definitely on the verge of being exhausted!

Time to continue!

Yang Ye shot out another strand of sword energy.

Just like that, around an hour passed before Yang Ye released another strand of sword energy, and it struck against the circle of symbols. Yang Ye watched as the mountain shook violently. Even though the circle of symbols was still here, it hadn’t reacted to his attack at all.

Yang Ye knew that the spirit energy within the formation had been exhausted.

Meanwhile, the people hanging on the mountain wall started to drop down slowly. Obviously, the mysterious woman did it.

Yang Ye sized up those people. They were a little different than ordinary humans. Besides their dressing, it was their appearance. He couldn’t pinpoint exactly what was different. In any case, they didn’t feel like ordinary humans to him.

Yang Ye didn’t watch further, and he just turned around and walked away.

He’d saved them, and he didn’t want to be dragged into anything else. So, the important matter at hand was to immediately leave them behind.

As far as he was concerned, it was better to avoid extra problems!

But right when he was about to leave the village, the hand suddenly appeared on his shoulder again.

Yang Ye stopped and laughed bitterly, “I’ve saved them. What else do you want me to do?”

She moved her hand to his back and started writing.

It was only a single word — Save!

Yang Ye said, “Haven’t I done that?”

She started writing again, but it was still the same word — Save! Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

As soon as she finished speaking, she grabbed his shoulder and started moving backwards.

It didn’t take long for Yang Ye to return to where he had been. At this moment, he understood what she meant. They were lying on the ground. Even though they were breathing, they hadn’t woken up.

She wanted him to wake them up!

Yang Ye thought for a moment and said, “I can give it a try. However, I dare not guarantee that I can awaken them. If I fail, you have to promise that you won’t force me to stay....”

She patted him gently on the shoulder to display her encouragement.

Yang Ye nodded, and then he went over to a young girl. He placed his right hand on her head, and then the Primordial Violet Energy within him gradually entered her mind.

He didn’t know what was wrong with them, but he knew that if Primordial Violet Energy couldn’t help them, then they couldn’t be saved!

Fortunately, after around 10 breaths of time passed, the little girl’s brows twitched slightly. Yang Ye hurriedly increased the amount of Primordial Violet Energy he was sending to her, and it didn’t take long for her to open her eyes.

She gazed at him, blinked, and then suddenly grabbed his hand before speaking softly, “Big Brother....”

Big brother!

Hearing these words warmed Yang Ye’s heart. At this moment, he thought of his younger sister. He grinned and said, “It’s alright now.”

She held tightly to his hand as if she was afraid that he would leave.

Yang Ye consoled her for a while, and then he started treating the others.

Just like that, around an hour passed before everyone here had woken up.

An old man with a long beard stood in front of Yang Ye, and he gazed at Yang Ye for a long time before he said, “You’re human!”

Yang Ye glanced at the old man and said, “Aren’t all of you human too?”

The old man shook his head, “Of course not.”

Yang Ye was curious and asked, “Then what are you?”

The old man didn’t answer him. He just gazed at Yang Ye for a long time. Suddenly, he stretched out his hand and pressed it against Yang Ye’s shoulder. It was so swift that Yang Ye hadn’t been able to react.

Once the old man’s hand descended onto his shoulder, Yang Ye instantly felt a mysterious force charge into his mind, and then his mind felt heavy before he fell unconscious.

Kindness is a mistake!

That was the final thought Yang Ye had before he lost consciousness.
