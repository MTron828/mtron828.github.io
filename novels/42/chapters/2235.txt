Chapter 2236 – Pity!

Corpses covered the area ahead.

They floated in the air, and formed a dense mass that was impossible to count.

They just floated there, and some were even still bleeding.

“What’s this?” Yang Ye frowned slightly, “What are they doing?”

“Extracting death energy!” Meanwhile, Ding Shaoyao spoke abruptly, “They are extracting death energy.”

Yang Ye said, “So many people and so much death energy… Who are they extracting it for?”

Ding Shaoyao gazed at him, “You have the Sword Domain and the Bodhi Tree, so you can head over without alerting anyone, but we’ll be noticed with ease if we approach the area.”

Yang Ye pondered deeply for a moment, nodded, and vanished on the spot.

After he concealed himself with the Sword Domain, even Shitian and Ding Shaoyao could barely notice him. So, unless they were intentionally looking for him, or to be more precise, unless they knew he was here, even they wouldn’t be able to notice his presence.

Shi Tian glanced at Yang Ye, “He’s quite impulsive!”

Ding Shaoyao spoke softly, “That’s how he is!”

Shi Tian spoke indifferently, “That’s good too. He can be used!”

Ding Shaoyao glanced at him and didn’t say anything.

However, Shi Tian and Ding Shaoyao hadn’t noticed a tiny ray of sword energy vanish soundlessly near them.

…

At an expanse of space, Yang Ye stood on the spot, and glanced in the direction of Shi Tian and Ding Shaoyao, “Playing tricks with me? I will get your god race destroyed.”

Yang Ye vanished on the spot.

An alliance with the god race?

Yang Ye was no fool. Not to mention that individual interests were the most important among individuals, let alone races. So, since the very beginning, he’d been vigilant toward the god race, and he hoped for them to think of him as a fool.

Yang Ye was never afraid of playing tricks. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

It didn’t take long for Yang Ye to arrive before the pile of corpses. There were corpses of the human race, sky race, and every other race! As for the amount, in any case, it was Yang Ye’s first time seeing so many dead bodies.

Yang Ye following allowed them and slowly snuck forward. Just like that, he advanced for almost two hours, but he was still surrounded by endless corpses.

Yang Ye was someone who could kill without batting an eyelid, but even he felt quite terrified now.

There were really too, too many corpses here!

There was a difference between him and the undying race. He didn’t just kill everyone he saw, and he wouldn’t kill unless they tried to kill him. But the undying race did it just for the sake of killing!

To be frank, the undying race slaughtered all living beings like humans slaughtered animals for food, they both felt it was perfectly justified.

Cruel?

In the eyes of the undying race, it wasn’t cruel at all. Just like how humans wouldn’t think killing animals for food was cruel. Because they wanted to live and fill their stomachs.

The strong preyed on the weak!

Yang Ye shook his head and continued forward. Everywhere he passed, corpses covered the world in a dense and endless expanse.

Because he was worried about alarming the undying race, Yang Ye didn’t speed up and moved forward slowly. There were extraordinary experts in the undying race too, so he had to be careful.

Around two hours later, Yang Ye stopped. There were much lesser corpses around him now, and there was a huge altar in front of him. There were many people on the altar, a dense group of living people, and their eyes were filled with terror. As for the center of the altar, Yang Ye saw a familiar figure!

The Buddhist Progenitor!

The Buddhist Progenitor of the Buddhist Path!

Yang Ye snuck forward a little more. At this moment, an undying cavalry appeared near the Buddhist Progenitor, and she glanced at him and said, “The death energy is too little, we need even more.”

The Buddhist Progenitor pressed his palms together, “There are no more people to kill.”

“No more to kill?” The undying cavalry laughed coldly, “There are billions of living beings throughout the large universe? But there aren’t more to kill after just these few? I don’t want to waste time with you. We need more death energy, right now!”

The Buddhist Progenitor pondered deeply for a moment and said, “Many have fled to Void Spirit Continent. We’ll definitely get even more death energy if we annihilate them.”

Void Spirit Continent!

Yang Ye laughed coldly in the shadows. Even now, that old baldy still hasn’t forgotten me, huh?

Void Spirit Continent!

The undying cavalry glanced coldly at him, “You don’t have to worry about that. Once you’ve killed all the people here, go to the next place. It’s not just you, it’s the same for all the other places. If the death energy is insufficient, we’ll use the experts of your Buddhist Path!”

She turned around and left once she finished speaking.

The Buddhist Progenitor pressed his palms together, closed his eyes, and fell silent.

A short while passed before he looked at the others here, “Good and bad, life is filled with pain. Your death today is not pain, it is release, great release!”

He flipped his right hand lightly.

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!

Countless figures stiffened on the spot, and then strands of black energy flashed out from them and converged at the door of light at the center of the altar.

For a time, howls of sorrow and pain filled the surroundings!

They begged for mercy and cursed.

However, the Buddhist Progenitor remained indifferent.

As more and more death energy converged at the door of light, more and more were dying here.

Suddenly, a ray of blood red light appeared behind the Buddhist Progenitor. The latter’s eyes instantly opened wide when it appeared, and then a terrifying wave of golden light rippled out from the golden lotus beneath him.

Bang!

A rumbling explosion resounded through the altar, and the Buddhist Progenitor was blasted away!

As soon as he stopped himself, the golden lotus exploded apart and transformed into fragments that rained down from there.

Everyone gazed at the area above the altar, and a man in green clothes was standing there.

“Yang Ye!” Someone exclaimed.

Practically no one throughout the large universe didn’t know Yang Ye. So, as soon as he appeared, all of them were filled with joy.

Hope!

They saw hope!

Yang Ye ignored them and gazed at the Buddhist Progenitor, and the latter glanced at him, “Your strength has improved quite a bit. Congratulations.”

Yang Ye grinned, “Buddhist Progenitor, they say the Buddhist Path is one of kindness and benevolence. Aren’t you afraid that karma will come for you when you’re killing like this?”

“Kindness and benevolence?” The Buddhist Progenitor replied indifferently, “Do you believe that?”

Yang Ye roared with laughter, “Indeed, everything in the world revolves around interests and benefits! Benevolence is just the pity of the strong to the weak.”

The Buddhist Progenitor spoke softly, “You seem to know it well.”

He glanced at the people here and continued, “If I don’t kill them, many of my Buddhist Path will die, and so will I.”

Yang Ye shook his head, “I don’t care about that. Let’s resolve the enmity between us today.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye vanished on the spot with the Sword Supreme in his grasp. A moment later, a ray of sword energy flashed like a bolt of lightning.

The Buddhist Progenitor’s eyes narrowed slightly, and he flipped his right palm slightly before slapping it forward.

Bang!

It forcefully stopped Yang Ye’s attack, but then terrifying sword intent and slaughter intent surged out from the sword.

Bang!

The Buddhist Progenitor was blasted away once more.

Yang Ye didn’t stop. He stomped his right foot down and swung the Sword Supreme with both hands.

Hiss!

It left a mark in space as it shot forward!

The powerful energy the Sword Supreme carries cracked open the surrounding space. If Yang Ye wasn’t suppressing it by force and stopping the energy within from leaking out, it would have instantly obliterated the space here!

An unprecedentedly solemn expression appeared in the Buddhist Progenitor’s eyes!

Yang Ye’s current strength had far surpassed his imagination!

Even he felt horrified by this attack!

He didn’t dare to act carelessly and pressed his palms together.

Boom!

As soon as he did that, a terrifying golden palm appeared around 1km ahead of him, and it immediately stopped Yang Ye’s attack. As soon as they came into contact, the space here shook violently, and so did the black hole around them.

Hiss!

An instant later, Yang Ye’s sword pierced through the golden palm!

The Buddhist Progenitor’s pupils constricted from the sight of this. He clenched his right fist and slammed it forward.

Bang!

A terrifying wave of golden energy rippled forth.

However, it wasn’t able to stop Yang Ye’s sword. The Sword Supreme didn’t encounter any difficulty when it shattered the golden wave of energy. Meanwhile, the Buddhist Progenitor had turned around and transformed into a ray of golden light that shot off into the sky.

Flee!

After two collisions, he’d realized something, Yang Ye could kill him while wielding the Sword Supreme!

So, he’d decisively chosen to flee and not fight Yang Ye to the death!

However, Yang Ye was prepared this time. As soon as the Buddhist Progenitor fled, a mysterious wave of energy appeared here.

The Sword Domain!

“Suppress him!” Yang Ye’s voice resounded, and then a powerful wave of energy pressed down upon the Buddhist Progenitor, causing his speed to instantly decline.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye had arrived with his sword in hand.

Right when Yang Ye’s sword was just half an inch away from the Buddhist Progenitor’s forehead, the Buddhist Progenitor’s voice resounded in Yang Ye’s mind, “Your father isn’t really dead!”

Yang Ye’s sword stopped.
