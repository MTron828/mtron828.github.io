Chapter 2049 – Fight Me All at Once!

The Weapon Dimension!

Yang Ye swiftly returned to the Weapon Dimension, and then he headed straight for the Prediction Line.

Suddenly, Elder Yuan appeared in front of him.

Elder Yuan spoke softly, “Since you’ve left, why return?”

Yang Ye spoke in a low voice, “I can’t just leave after what happened.”

Elder Yuan said, “It’s not a big deal. Great men should be able to act according to the situation. Leave now and I guarantee that no one will come looking for trouble with you again. You’ll be able to arrive safely at Martial Emperor Academy!” nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Yang Ye smiled, “Elder Yuan, I appreciate your good intentions. While it’s never too late for a gentleman to have his revenge, I’m no gentleman. The Prediction Line’s people wanted to kill me, failed, then one of their seniors came. That’s bullshit!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he cupped his fists to Elder Yuan and vanished into the distance.

Elder Yuan shook his head and spoke softly, “It’s nice to be young!”

He wasn’t displeased or against Yang Ye’s actions. As for the reason, it was because he’d been young once too.

The young were impulsive, headstrong, and refused to suffer even the slightest loss… That was youth.

Even though it may come with a price, it wasn’t wrong.

Who hadn’t been impulsive when they were young? Who hadn’t fought in their youth? Who hadn’t been headstrong in their early days?

A short while passed before Elder Yuan spoke softly, “Those fellows from the Prediction Line are such fools. They just had to do this when that little fellow was about to leave. How unnecessary!

Elder Yuan vanished on the spot once he finished speaking.

Prediction Mountain.

Yang Ye’s figure descended on his sword to the foot of Prediction Mountain. A wisp of icy cold flashed through his eyes as he gazed at it, and then his figure shot up into the sky. As he looked at Prediction Mountain, the icy coldness in his eyes gradually transformed into ferocity.

A moment of silence ensued, and then Yang Ye suddenly said, “I heard the Prediction Line has countless geniuses. I, Yang Ye, am no great expert, but I’d like to experience it for myself.”

Yang Ye had intentionally made his voice reverberate through Prediction Mountain. So, the entire Prediction Line was alarmed by it.

It wasn’t just Prediction Mountain, even the entire Weapon Dimension was alarmed.

Yang Ye had taken the initiative to attack himself!

So, the divine sense of countless experts swept over.

On Prediction Mountain, a middle aged man suddenly appeared beside Yang Ye. It was the middle aged man who’d saved Su Lang and the others earlier.

The middle aged man stared at Yang Ye, “Is leaving safely not good enough for you?”

“No!” Yang Ye grinned, “Didn’t you Prediction Line want to kill me? Come, I’m here right now.” Yang Ye pointed at himself, “Today, I challenge the younger generation of the entire Prediction Line, until death!”

Until death! It wasn’t a spar!

The middle aged man’s eyes narrowed slightly, and he slowly clenched his right fist.

Suddenly, a voice came from afar, “Haha… What a show! What a show indeed!”

As soon as the voice finished resounding, a white robed middle aged man appeared behind Yang Ye.

It was the Young Martial Uncle of the Slaughter Line!

However, his figure was ethereal. Obviously, it wasn’t his main body.

The middle aged man frowned at the sight of Young Martial Uncle. He was about to speak when Young Martial Uncle pointed at him, “Lei Ye, if you dare to attack him, then I’ll definitely obliterate you. I won’t spare you even if our ancestor asks me to. You can try me if you don’t believe me!”

Lei Ye’s expression instantly became extremely unsightly. He was about to speak when Young Martial Uncle turned to look at Yang Ye, “Are you sure that you want to fight all the geniuses of the Prediction Line? Let me warn you in advance that I won’t save you if you fail. But don’t worry, no one can bully you, and no one can break the rules.”

Yang Ye glanced at him and said, “Senior, your main body isn’t even here…”

Young Martial Uncle replied indifferently, “You don’t have to worry about that.”

Yang Ye nodded, and then he gazed in the direction of Prediction Mountain, “What? Does the Prediction Line have no one capable? Not even a single person is willing to fight me?”

“Yang Ye!” Suddenly, a furious shout resounded from the sky, and then a ray of light shot over here. It didn’t take long for it to stop, and then a man appeared before Yang Ye.

“Didn’t you want to fight?” The man glanced coldly at Yang Ye, “Come! Let’s fight! As you’ve said, we’ll fight to the death!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he was about to attack, but Yang Ye raised his palm, and a sword floated above his palm. A moment later, a ray of light flashed.

Burial!

Burial was countless times stronger than it had been in the past. Especially after he’d comprehended the Sword Soul. Moreover, his cultivation had risen as well. So, it could be described as being incomparable!

Lei Ye’s expression had changed drastically when Yang Ye attacked. He wanted to stop Yang Ye, but an aura suddenly locked onto him.

It was the Young Martial Uncle!

Meanwhile, the head of that man from the Prediction Line flew up into the air.

Blood sprayed like a fountain!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye lowered his sword and gazed at Lei Ye, “Can you not send such weaklings to fight me?”

As soon as these words were spoken, clamorous noise resounded through Prediction Mountain. Yang Ye was openly insulting the Prediction Line!

All of them were hot blooded, so countless geniuses flew out of the mountain towards the sky.

“Go back right now!” Suddenly, Lei Ye howled with fury, and a powerful aura blasted all of them over 1km away.

“Elder Lei, let me fight him!” Meanwhile, a young man spoke fiercely, “He openly insulted our Prediction Line, I…”

“Cut the fucking crap!” Suddenly, Yang Ye pointed his sword at the group behind Lei Ye, “Stop fucking wasting time too. Just fight me together! I’ll fight all of you by myself!”

“I’ll teach you some manners!” A furious howl resounded, and then a young man shot out of the group and charged at Yang Ye.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye’s sword suddenly vanished, and then Lei Ye’s expression changed. He was about to stop Yang Ye’s attack, but Young Martial Uncle suddenly spoke slowly, “Try it!”

Lei Ye’s face fell, and then he gazed at Young Martial Uncle. Meanwhile, a head flew up into the air.

Lei Ye’s face became extremely unsightly.

However, that wasn’t the end of it. Yang Ye raised his sword and spoke to the others in the group, “Didn’t the Prediction Line want to kill me? I’m standing before you right now, so come kill me!”

“Go back! All of you! Right now!” Lei Ye shouted with fury.

Yang Ye suddenly said, “What? You’re being cowards now? No one in the entire Prediction Line has some balls?”

“Fuck you!” As soon as a man spoke those words, Yang Ye’s sword had vanished.

Burial!

A ray of light flashed, and the man’s head flew up into the air at the same time that his voice resounded through the air.

Yang Ye looked at the other members of the Prediction Line, “Who’s next?”

“Yang Ye!” Suddenly, Lei Ye asked, “What do you want?!”

“What do I want?” Yang Ye gazed at Lei Ye, “You’re asking me what the fuck I want? Your Prediction Line kept sending people to kill me as soon as I arrived in the Weapon Dimension, but not only that, you sent someone to kill me even when I wanted to leave the Weapon Path. Now, you’re asking me what I want? Didn’t you want to kill me? Come on! I’m right here!”

Yang Ye gazed at the crowd in the distance, “What? Is the Prediction Line really filled with cowards? If it really is, then just tell me, and I’ll leave right away. I’m not the type to bully girls!”

Their faces turned purple with anger when they heard him.

Some of them really couldn’t take it and shot at Yang Ye. As soon as they did, the others charged at Yang Ye as well.

They couldn’t endure it any longer!

Lei Ye’s expression changed drastically when he saw them charge at Yang Ye, and he was about to stop them. However, Yang Ye suddenly charged at them, and an ethereal white dragon appeared around Yang Ye!

The Sky Dragon!

As soon as he saw Yang Ye attack, Lei Ye’s expression grew even more unsightly. He gazed at Young Martial Uncle. Sure enough, Young Martial Uncle’s gaze was on him and was waiting for him to make a move!

“AAAAAH…” Shrill cries resounded incessantly. Lei Ye looked around and saw that Yang Ye was like the reaper amidst the group, and heads flew wherever he passed.

He was unstoppable!

Yang Ye’s strength wasn’t something anyone ordinary could resist, and only experts at his realm of cultivation could suppress Yang Ye!

As for the younger generation of the Prediction Line, at the very least, the geniuses here were absolutely no match for Yang Ye!

More and more were dying!

Lei Ye fell silent. Suddenly, ferocity arose on his face, and then he gazed at Yang Ye and stretched his right hand forward. In an instant, a wave of energy suddenly enveloped Yang Ye’s figure…

Boom!

Yang Ye’s figure was blasted over 1km away!
