Chapter 1866 – Asura City!

Death by dismemberment!

At this moment, Yang Ye was doing just that, and he’d taken it a step further by cutting out piece by piece. Yang Ye’s sword technique was extremely good. Every single swing of his sword merely sliced off a thin pierce of the Night Emperor’s flesh. So, it was more like death by thousands of cuts.

It was bloody and cruel!

However, the Night Emperor was quite stubborn, and he didn’t even frown.

Just like that, around 15 minutes passed before the Night Emperor’s entire body became impossible to recognize. It was impossible to determine that the body belonged to a person.

But he was a Quasi Enlightened Realm expert in the end, so his vitality was extremely strong. Thus, he wasn’t dead.

Suddenly, Hou Qing’s voice resounded, “Be careful! His soul is about to flee!”

As soon as Hou Qing finished speaking, the Night Emperor’s body trembled, and then his body exploded apart before a black shadow shot up into the sky.

He was fleeing!

The Night Emperor’s goal was to escape with his soul. The reason he hadn’t chosen to flee earlier was because Yang Ye had been absolutely vigilant, so it was very difficult for his soul to escape. Yet now, his Dantian was destroyed, and he didn’t have the strength to fight back. So, Yang Ye’s vigilance towards him would be at its lowest.

So, this was the best opportunity for him to escape.

The Night Emperor’s howl resounded from the sky, “Yang Ye! I’ll definitely repay you a hundredfold for this humiliation!”

However, he didn’t notice that a sword howl had resounded at the instant his soul fled. An instant later, a shrill cry resounded far away in the sky. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Three breaths of time later, Yang Ye was back where he’d been standing just a short while ago, and the Night Emperor’s soul was in front of him. At this moment, the Night Emperor’s soul had a sword stabbed in it.

The Night Emperor gazed at Yang Ye with slight terror, “How… how did you know?”

Yang Ye closed his eyes slowly, “I’ll ask you one last time. Where’s my second sister’s blood pearl?”

“The Quintessence Blood Pearl?” The Night Emperor spoke fiercely, “Yang Ye, I’m not going to tell you. I’m going to make you spend eternity in regret! Hahaha!”

Snap!

Suddenly, Yang Ye snapped his fingers, and then a flame appeared from the tip of his finger.

The Divine Yin Flame!

Yang Ye flicked it forward, and it enveloped the Night Emperor.

“AH!!” A shrill and miserable cry resounded, and just hearing it made the hearts of the others tremble with fear.

The Divine Yin Flame just burned the Night Emperor’s soul. However, it didn’t kill him. But at this moment, the Night Emperor hoped that the flame would just incinerate him. Unfortunately, Yang Ye didn’t let him get his wish.

Yang Ye asked, “I’ll just roast you like this. I have all the time in the world.”

He sat down cross-legged and closed his eyes.

Just like that, the Night Emperor’s shrill cries resounded incessantly.

Around 15 minutes later, the Night Emperor suddenly said, “It’s with the Asura Exalt! It’s with the Asura Exalt…”

Yang Ye opened his eyes and waved his right hand. The Divine Yin Flame returned to his palm, and then he gazed at the Night Emperor, “The Asura Exalt?”

The Night Emperor spoke weakly, “Yes. I was injured after your second sister sacrificed her cultivation to attack me, and I went to see Gu Huan for the sake of my recovery. However, he’d consumed the healing treasure he had, so I went through the Red Robed Heavenly Exalt to contact the Asura Exalt, and I exchanged that Quintessence Blood Pearl for the healing treasures I needed.”

“The Asura Exalt!” Yang Ye took a deep breath and asked, “Where is he?”

“Asura City!” The Night Emperor continued, “It’s his city. You may be able to find him there.”

Yang Ye gazed at the Night Emperor, and the latter said, “Give me a swift death.”

Yang Ye walked over to the Night Emperor and said, “There’s something I don’t really understand. I’m sure all five Heavenly Exalts and the three Ancient Cultivators were aware of my arrival, and they’re aware that the sword is in my possession. So, why haven’t they come to look for trouble with me?”

The Night Emperor gazed at Yang Ye for a long time and replied, “You can ask them yourself!”

Yang Ye looked down at the Night Emperor, “Do you want a quick death or not?”

The Night Emperor’s expression changed while fear filled his eyes. At this moment, he recalled the flames from before.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye added, “I’m even more curious about why you and the Red Robed Heavenly Exalt targeted me. Based on your level of intelligence, both of you should be aware that even if you get my sword, you wouldn’t be able to keep it. Moreover, it will bring endless troubles to you. But both of you still targeted me, and you even did so in such an open manner!”

The Night Emperor suddenly started chuckling, “Yang Ye, it looks like you’re not that stupid.”

Yang Ye asked, “Can you enlighten me?”

The Night Emperor chuckled, “Yang Ye, what puzzles me the most is why you’re keeping that sword. Based on your level of intelligence, you should be aware that you’ll face endless trouble if you keep it, right?”

Yang Ye glanced at the golden sword in his grasp. Why am I keeping this sword?

Actually, he’d thought about it in the past. Just think about it, if he knew from the beginning that the sword belonged to the Sovereign of Man, if he knew that it would bring him so much trouble, and if he knew that it would cause Blood Maiden’s death, then he would definitely not take it.

Unfortunately, there were no ‘ifs’ in life.

Since he’d taken it, he had to keep it until the end.

As for who the sword belonged to, that wasn’t important anymore.

Suddenly, the Night Emperor said, “Yang Ye, your enemies are more numerous than you imagine, and they’re much stronger too. Like I said, you won’t live long! Hahaha…”

Suddenly, Yang Ye waved his right hand, and the Divine Yin Flame instantly enveloped the Night Emperor. An instant later, the Night Emperor’s soul had been completely incinerated.

Yang Ye turned around and walked away, but he seemed to have thought of something and stopped just a moment later. He turned to look at Night Assassin City and said, “Night Assassin City can vanish from this world now!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he shot up into the sky, and then he clenched both his fists and slammed it down at the city.

In an instant, two extremely powerful waves of force swept down from the sky.

The expressions of everyone in the city changed drastically, and they shot madly out of the city.

As for the remaining members of the Night Assassins, they didn’t dare to defend the city and fled as well.

How could they dare to defend it at a time like this? If they defended it now, then Yang Ye wouldn’t just be destroying the city, he would be killing them too!

It didn’t take long for two waves of energy to sweep down into the city.

Rumble!

In an instant, the entire city was obliterated.

Night Assassin City had vanished from the world.

A long time passed before a voice resounded, “He’s… both crazy and violent… While that sword is great, living is better.”

“He has gone to the Asura Exalt.” Meanwhile, another voice resounded, “That fellow seems like he doesn’t know who the Asura Exalt is!”

Another voice resounded, “Based on his character, he may not care even if he does know.”

“No matter what, we have a show to watch now.”

“Indeed.”

It didn’t take long for the voices to fade, and then all of them rushed towards Asura City.

A ray of light shot through the sky. It was Yang Ye, of course. Once he left Night Assassin City, Yang Ye shot straight towards Asura City. At this moment, Blood Maiden filled his thoughts.

Once he found out that Blood Maiden had a chance at new life, she was the only thought left in his mind.

Suddenly, Hou Qing’s voice resounded in Yang Ye’s mind, “Kid, someone is following you!”

Yang Ye stopped. As soon as he did, a man in silver armor appeared far away in the distance. The armored man was the expert that the Sovereign of Man had sent down here to get the sword.

The armored man stared at Yang Ye and said, “Yang Ye, it’s best if you give that sword back. Otherwise…”

A sword howl resounded, and then a ray of golden light flashed.

The armored man’s expression changed drastically at the sight of this, and then his spear transformed into a silver dragon that shot forward.

Boom!

As soon as they collided, the silver dragon was instantly blasted apart, and the armored man was blasted over 10km away. At the same time, the silver spear in his hand was obliterated.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly spoke ferociously, “You want this sword? Do you still want it now? If you do, I’ll swing it again!”

The armored man’s face was extremely gloomy, “Yang Ye, that belongs to the Sovereign of Man. You…”

Suddenly, Yang Ye spoke fiercely, “Three breaths of time. If you don’t fuck off by then, then I’ll make your eyes see your back!”

The armored man’s expression was unsightly to the extreme. However, he didn’t say anything. He just glanced coldly at the sword in Yang Ye’s hand, and then he said, “This isn’t over!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he vanished on the spot.

If the sword wasn’t unsealed, he wouldn’t really fear it. But now that it was unsealed and combined with the explosive rise in Yang Ye’s strength, he couldn’t do anything to Yang Ye, and it was even to the extent that he may be killed by Yang Ye instead. So, he’d chosen to leave!

Once the armored man left, Yang Ye withdrew a violet crystal and swallowed it. After that, he transformed into a ray of light and vanished into the sky.

Around two hours later, a gloomy ancient city appeared before Yang Ye.

Yang Ye descended outside the city and looked up at the city gates. There were two blood red words there—Asura City.

Yang Ye lowered his head slightly and stayed silent for a while before he looked up at the city again, “Please notify the Asura Exalt that Yang Ye is here to see an audience.”

Yang Ye received no reply.

Three breaths of time later, a ray of light flashed.

Bang!

A part of the city wall was slashed into two.

Meanwhile, a voice reverberated like a thunderclap, “I want to see the Asura Exalt!”
