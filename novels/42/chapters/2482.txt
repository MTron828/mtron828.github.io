Chapter 2483 – Come On! Don’t Try to Rob Me!

Eternal Kingdom.

Once he passed through the Universe Wall, Yang Ye entered a teleportation passageway, and it didn’t take him long to enter a boundless world.

Around two hours later, the world before him finally became normal.

It was an expanse of the starry sky. Yang Ye was standing among the stars, and the Universe Wall was behind him.

It was a boundless starry sky, and it was deep and mysterious.

Yang Ye used the Sword Domain to conceal his aura completely and traveled forward.

Meanwhile, he asked, “Sword Scroll, can you tell me about this world?”

A short while passed before Sword Scroll’s voice resounded in Yang Ye’s mind, “Eternal Kingdom has five main regions, the East, South, North, West, and Central Regions. Every region represents a power. The Di Clan used to be the lord of the South Region. Unfortunately, they were driven out, and I can only wonder what power has replaced them now!”

Yang Ye nodded slightly, “Continue!”

She continued, “Besides the five regions, there are other small worlds and mysterious locations. For example, the Sprite World. The Sprite World was where the Sprite Progenitor lived. While it’s a small place, its status transcends the five regions. It’s naturally because it is the Sprite Progenitor’s home. Besides that, there are some other forbidden areas that even I don’t know much about!”

The Sprite World!

Yang Ye committed the place to memory, and he planned to have a look at it when he could. Because according to the previous Sprite Progenitor, that place belonged to Snowy!

Since it was Snowy’s, it was his!

Yang Ye asked, “Can you sense the fragments of your main body?”

She replied, “Yes, it’s at the West Region’s Ancient Sword Sect.”

“The Ancient Sword Sect?” Yang Ye nodded, “Tell me about it.”

Sword Scroll said, “The Ancient Sword Sect was once one of the top powers in Eternal Kingdom, and it’s the only sect of sword cultivators here. However, it suffered terrible losses during the war all those years ago, and I don’t know if it has recovered now.”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and said, “Sword Scroll, why did you leave and come to Eternal Border?”

Sword Scroll fell silent for a long time and said, “I was a Super Divine Treasure all those years ago too. While my main body was destroyed, my spirit remained. However, the Sprite Progenitor perished at that time, so no one could repair me. As far as the Ancient Sword Sect was concerned, it was impossible for me to recover. Thus, they chose to refine me!”

“Refine you?” Yang Ye frowned, “What do you mean?”

She replied indifferently, “They wanted to devour my spirit. If my spirit was devoured, it wouldn’t just provide them with a huge amount of knowledge in the Sword Dao, it would increase their strength tremendously. After all, I’m the spirit of a Super Divine Treasure, and the spirit of a sword too.”

Yang Ye shook his head, “That’s not right!”

She said, “Right or wrong doesn’t matter at all. I’m not even a Divine Treasure now. Since it’s impossible for me to return to being a Super Divine Treasure, I’m useless to them. No, I still have one use, and it’s to be devoured.”

Yang Ye asked, “Did no one try to stop that from happening?”

She laughed with ridicule, “Stop it? Who would do that? The person who wanted to devour me was my past master, that expert who lost his body to a single slap from the Desolate Emperor. If his strength hadn’t been reduced tremendously because his body had been destroyed, and if I hadn’t been vigilant, I would have ceased to exist in this world by now.”

Yang Ye shook his head. He wasn’t capable of doing something like that, and now he understood why she was so resentful.𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Anyone would be resentful when the person they trusted the most betrayed them!

Yang Ye said, “Then let’s go to the Ancient Sword Sect first!”

Sword Scroll replied solemnly, “You must be careful. While you don’t have to fear Five World Realm experts now, your identity is unique. I’m afraid you’ll be hunted again if you cause a huge commotion.”

Yang Ye nodded slightly, “I know!”

Yang Ye vanished on the spot.

The West.

Sword Scroll guided Yang Ye to the West Region, and Yang Ye instantly felt dense sword intent and sword energy once he entered the area.

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings, and then he shot to Ancient Sword City.

Ancient Sword City!

The Ancient Sword Sect’s subordinate city!

Most powers had their own subordinate cities or countries. Because every power needed fresh blood to join them, and all of these powers would fight to recruit geniuses.

In the past, many powers had fought each other for the sake of human resources, and the outcome was both sides suffered from it! In the end, they made an agreement to foster such resources themselves. Just like that, practically every power had their own subordinate cities or countries. Because they were an endless source of geniuses for them.

At the entrance to Ancient Sword City, Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings and said, “It isn’t very different from Eternal Border!”

Sword Scroll said, “The difference is huge. Sense the surroundings carefully. The spirit energy and people here are far different from the people on the outside. Of course, there is no difference to you. Because you are an extraordinarily monstrous genius, and you have the Primordial Pagoda and Snowy. So, you can’t experience the benefits of this place because even the spirit energy in Eternal Kingdom cannot compare to what you possess. So, think of it from a different angle!”

Yang Ye glanced at the ground below, then glanced at the city, and it didn’t take long for a solemn expression to gradually appear on his face.

It was different indeed!

The spirit energy here couldn’t compete with his Primordial Violet Energy and Eternal Energy, but it wasn’t that inferior!

Moreover, the spirit energy here contained the aura of Eternal Energy. It wasn’t very pure, but it was much better than the spirit energy in Eternal Border. Moreover, the people here seemed much more intelligent than the ordinary cultivators of Eternal Border.

The civilian area and VIP area!

These two things came to mind. Eternal Kingdom was like the VIP area, and the worlds outside were like the civilian area.

The people outside want to squeeze inside, but the people here look down on the people from the outside and try their best to keep them out. Just like that, conflict arises.

Yang Ye shook his head. He didn’t have any feelings toward this. As for Eternal Kingdom, as far as he was concerned, there was nothing good about him. As Sword Scroll had said, there were no rich VIPs before him.

Could anyone ever compete in wealth with him?

However, Yang Ye was quite against the way Eternal Kingdom did things. Or to be more precise, anyone would hate that sense of superiority they had!

The people of Eternal Kingdom had a strong sense of superiority!

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts and entered the city. Practically everyone in the city had a sword on their back, and many of them had quite good cultivations. Besides that, people flew on swords in the air or just flew normally from time to time. It was quite a magnificent sight!

Yang Ye asked as he traveled, “Sword Scroll, can you sense the fragments of your main body?”

She replied, “I can. However, you can’t just enter the Ancient Sword Sect like that. It is covered in powerful restrictions, so even your Sword Domain can’t help you sneak in undetected. You must enter it through normal methods.”

“Normal methods?” Yang Ye frowned, “What kind of normal methods?”

She fell silent for a short while and said, “Join the Ancient Sword Sect and look for an opportunity to steal those fragments. That’s the only way. Otherwise, it would be too dangerous to sneak in. Once your presence is exposed, you’ll definitely be hunted by countless people. This isn’t like the world outside. Five World Realm experts can fight here, and even experts above the Five World Realm may show themselves.”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and nodded, “Alright, but… How do I join the Ancient Sword Sect? Recommend myself to them?”

She replied, “People will suspect you if you do that, and they’ll grow even more suspicious once they investigate you.”

Yang Ye shook his head, “This is quite troublesome!”

Sword Scroll spoke indifferently, “If you think it’s troublesome, you can charge it and seize it just like that!”

Yang Ye was quite tempted to do that.

Meanwhile, Sword Scroll added, “There are at least 5 Five World Realm experts in there. Besides that, there are Lord Realm experts there too, and maybe more than one!”

Yang Ye spoke seriously, “I think it isn’t troublesome at all. Come on, let’s join the Ancient Sword Sect. I was planning on taking a look and learning from them anyway!”

Yang Ye walked off into the distance.

Sword Scroll shook her head and smiled in the Primordial Pagoda.

Yang Ye found an inn to stay in. According to Sword Scroll, he had to wait until the experts of the Ancient Sword Sect came to recruit in the city, and then he could reveal some of his strength to draw their attention. After that, they would take him to the Ancient Sword Sect. Once he was inside, he could look for an opportunity to steal the fragments of Sword Scroll’s main body.

That was their plan!

Yang Ye went to the inn’s counter. The manager behind the counter was an old man, and he was actually at the True Void Realm!

The manager glanced at Yang Ye, “Do you need something?”

Yang Ye nodded, “Do you know when the Ancient Sword Sect will be coming to recruit people?”

The manager sized up Yang Ye, “You want to join them?”

Yang Ye nodded, “Yes.”

The manager fell silent.

Yang Ye asked, “What? Can’t I?”

The manager glanced at Yang Ye, and then he lowered his head and continued with his own work.

What was the old man trying to convey?

Yang Ye was quite puzzled. Meanwhile, Sword Scroll suddenly said, “Pay up!”

Pay up!

Yang Ye immediately realized what he had to do and placed an Eternal Divine Crystal before the old man.

The old man was stunned when he saw it!

An Eternal Divine Crystal!

Yang Ye’s best crystals were the Eternal World Crystals. Snowy had taken half of them, and he still had some. However, they were too precious, so he couldn’t bear to give them away. Thus, he gave the old man an Eternal Divine Crystal.

However, he wasn’t aware that it was still extremely precious to ordinary people!

After all, True Void Realm experts usually used Eternal Immortal Crystals!

The old man took a deep and long glance at Yang Ye, and then the inn turned ethereal. A short while later, the entire inn was in a boundless expanse of space.

He’d been forcefully transported into space!

Meanwhile, a beautiful woman suddenly appeared, and she smiled, “Young Brother, tell me about your origins.”

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings. There were a few black clothed experts here, and all of them were at the Limitbreaker Realm!

One should never reveal their wealth!

Yang Ye shook his head and said, “Can’t all of you pursue something better in life? It’s just a single Eternal Divine Crystal. Isn’t that a little beneath all of you?”

He flicked over another Eternal Divine Crystal over to them.

The woman was stunned by this.

Yang Ye said, “Come on, don’t rob me. I’ll give all of you one each. You seem so poor, and I really can’t bear to let it go on.”

All of them were stunned speechless.
