Chapter 2802 – The Calm Before the Storm!

Dead!

Yang Ye was stunned for a long time.

Ding Shaoyao sighed softly and didn’t say anything either. Because she knew him well, and if he had decided on something, it would be very difficult to change his decision.

Yang Ye suddenly said, “Take everyone to Eternal Border!”

Ding Shaoyao gazed at Yang Ye, “What about you?”

Yang Ye replied softly, “I’ll guard the rear.”

She heaved a sigh of relief in her heart. He wasn’t the same Yang Ye who used to disregard the consequences, he was much more mature now.

Ding Shaoyao pointed at the huge barrier of light in the sky, “That barrier of light and Monarch Yan are our biggest problems!”

Yang Ye was about to speak when Yang Busi suddenly arrived before him.

Yang Ye gazed at her, “Senior?”

She said, “I’ll keep Monarch Yan busy, you deal with the formation. Of course, if it’s possible, just destroy it.”

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment, and she frowned slightly, “Are you looking down on me?”

Yang Ye shook his head and smiled, “Be careful.”

She glanced at him, grunted, and then vanished into the sky.

Yang Ye charged up into the sky after her. However, he left Snowy behind. In order to keep Snowy and Ding Shaoyao safe, he’d left a strand of his sword intent with them. So long as they were in danger, he would be able to sense it immediately!

Moreover, even a strand of sword intent from him could stop some Destiny Realm experts now!

So long as it wasn’t an expert at Monarch Yan or the other mysterious expert’s level, they would find it impossible to immediately kill Snowy and Ding Shaoyao!

Ding Shaoyao brought Snowy into a mountain range, and she arrived before Chen Dao’zi, “How is it doing?”

Chen Dao’zi nodded, “It’s practically done and ready to be activated! However, it needs a huge, huge amount of spirit energy…”

His gaze descended onto Snowy at this point, and the latter cracked a smile.

Chen Dao’zi shook his head and smiled. Since they had this little fellow with them, spirit energy wasn’t a problem at all!

Ding Shaoyao nodded slightly, “Activate the formation!”

Once she gave the command, the huge barrier of light before them shook violently. Chen Dao’zi gazed at Snowy, and the latter blinked before waving her paw. In an instant, spirit energy instantly appeared within the huge barrier of light, and it was so much of spirit energy that it stunned both Ding Shaoyao and Chen Dao’zi.

It was terrifying!

Chen Dao’zi glanced at Snowy, and the latter cracked a smile while waving her paws. She was asking if it was enough!

Chen Dao’zi quickly nodded, “It’s enough!”

After that, he formed a seal with both hands and fully activated this newly set up formation of his.

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!

Countless huge beams of light surged up into the sky. They weren’t attacking at random, nor did they just cover an area, they were attacks that locked onto their targets.

Along with the arrival of those beams of light, the expressions of those experts from the Four Dimensional Universe, who were fighting in midair, changed drastically. They had no choice but to abandon their opponents, and when they tried to defend themselves from those beams of light, the experts of the Three Dimensional Universe started to retreat toward Eternal Border!

Ding Shaoyao said, “Let’s go!”

Snowy pointed at Yang Ye instead. She rubbed Snowy’s head gently and said, “Don’t worry, he’ll be fine.”

Based on Yang Ye’s current strength, perhaps only Destiny was guaranteed of being able to kill him.

As for the Unfettered One, she didn’t know how strong he really was. Moreover, the Unfettered One wouldn’t target Yang Ye. If he wanted to, he would have done so years ago. So, unless the strongest form of Destiny attacked, Yang Ye would definitely be able to stay alive!

The reason he was stuck in battle there was merely because he wanted to be there.

Otherwise, the Four Dimensional Universe couldn’t keep him anywhere!

A short while later, the Destiny Realm experts of the Three Dimensional Universe had retreated. In this short amount of time, practically all of them had left Eternal Kingdom.

As for the experts from the Four Dimensional Universe, once they destroyed the formations down below, they didn’t give chase. Their primary objective was to take control of Eternal Kingdom.

Meanwhile, Yang Busi was keeping Monarch Yan busy in battle. It wasn’t that difficult for her because Yang Ye had fought Monarch Yan earlier, and the latter had exhausted too much of his strength. He wasn’t at his prime at all!

On the other side, the battle was quite strenuous for Yang Ye!

He didn’t know what kind of formation it was, all he did know was that it was truly powerful!

Every beam of light it shot at him was capable of pushing him back with ease. Even his Sword Domain, Burial, and the Sword Precursor couldn’t stop the beams of light. If he didn’t possess an extremely fast rate of recovery, he wouldn’t be able to stop this formation!

When he saw that all the experts of the Three Dimensional Universe had retreated, Yang Ye stopped going head-on against the formation and waved his sword at Monarch Yan.

Hiss!

A ray of sword energy flashed through the sky.

Monarch Yan’s expression changed drastically as he fought Yang Busi, and he immediately abandoned her and slammed a punch at Yang Ye’s attack.

Bam!

The powerful energy released from this punch blasted open the space before him!

However, along with the arrival of Yang Ye’s attack, the energy was instantly obliterated.

Boom!

An instant later, Monarch Yan was blasted away.

Yang Ye was about to attack again when a beam of light suddenly shot at him, and space turned pitch black in its wake!

Its strength wasn’t something the space in the Three Dimensional Universe could endure at all!

Yang Ye frowned slightly. Burial shot out from his waist and slashed the beam of light.

Boom!

The beam of light shook violently while Burial was blasted away.

At the instant Burial left the Sword Gourd, Yang Ye took Yang Busi with him and shot backward. At the same time, he waved the Sword Precursor incessantly, causing rays of sword energy to rain down upon the beam of light.

Rumble!

Rumbling and deafening explosions resounded through the sky.

In the end, Yang Ye was pushed over 10km away before he was finally able to destroy the beam of light.

Yang Busi had an extremely solemn expression on her face. The beam of light was so powerful that if she had been up against it, she would have never been able to stop it. Even Yang Ye found it very strenuous to stop right now, unless he was able to utilize the Fate Sword Dao.

Unfortunately, it was a state that wasn’t so easy to enter!

Actually, Monarch Yan’s face was more solemn than Yang Ye or Yang Busi. His formation was built with the strength of the entire Four Dimensional Universe, and it was made for their battle with Destiny. It could be said that if he hadn’t been forced into a hopeless situation, he would never reveal it so rashly. But Yang Ye was truly too strong, and the Four Dimensional Universe and him couldn’t endure Yang Ye’s attacks without this formation!

But even after they activated the formation, Yang Ye was still able to resist it!

Such strength was truly terrifying!

Yang Ye gazed at Yang Busi, “Senior, you leave first!”

Yang Busi frowned slightly, “You’re not leaving?”

Yang Ye replied softly, “I’ll guard the rear.”

She hesitated for a moment and said, “Fine, based on your strength, they wouldn’t be able to stop you if you chose to leave! But be careful!”

Yang Ye nodded, he would never underestimate his opponent.

Yang Busi didn’t say anything else and just left.

Yang Ye stood there with his sword in hand while looking at Monarch Yan and the other experts of the Four Dimensional Universe.

Those experts who planned on chasing after the experts from the Three Dimensional Universe were quite afraid because Yang Ye was standing before them, and if they were to try that, they would have to get through Yang Ye.

Unfortunately, he wasn’t that easy to overcome!

Monarch Yan gazed at Yang Ye in silence.

In the end, Yang Ye turned around and left.

No one dared to chase after him!

Monarch Yan closed his eyes slowly, “Don’t leave Eternal Kingdom for now.”

“Understood!” Countless experts from the Four Dimensional Universe bowed in his direction.

Monarch Yan’s figure vanished on the spot, and he arrived at a point in outer space. Suddenly, Shu Wubian appeared before him.

He shot a glance behind her and said, “I have something to discuss with him.”

She was about to speak when an ethereal figure appeared before Monarch Yan.

It was the mysterious expert!

Monarch Yan glanced at the mysterious expert, “Yang Ye’s strength is…”

The mysterious expert suddenly shook his head and interrupted Monarch Yan, “From the moment you chose to submit to Destiny, we ceased to be allies and became enemies.”

Monarch Yan spoke solemnly, “You should know how strong she is!”Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

The mysterious expert grinned, “Of course I do. But so what? Allow me to be frank, I would fight her, even if it meant that I would die.”

Monarch Yan gazed at the mysterious expert for a very, very long time. In the end, he shook his head slightly, “You overestimate yourself!”

He turned around and vanished into the sky.

Shu Wubian suddenly said, “That woman is so strong she has instilled despair in him!”

The mysterious expert replied softly, “If you were to meet her in person, you would feel despair too!”

Shu Wubian frowned slightly, “She’s even stronger than her whole form from all those years ago?”

The mysterious expert replied, “Her whole form is gone, and she has been constantly cultivating over the years… She is an extraordinary genius too.”

Shu Wubian spoke solemnly, “Are you trying to say that we have no chance?”

The mysterious expert gazed at her and replied, “You can choose to leave!”

Shu Wubian looked him in the eyes, “What about you? You’re still going to fight her when you know that you’re no match for her?”

The mysterious expert shook his head and smiled, “Most would end up dying in the end, so why bother eating?”

Shu Wubian frowned slightly, and the Mysterious Expert continued, “There are some things that must be done, even if death awaits at the end of it. I understand why Monarch Yan surrendered to her, and not only that, I even respect him for it. He did it for his people and for the Four Dimensional Universe. But if I were to surrender, I would only be afraid of death.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he turned around and entered the spatial rift behind him.

Shu Wubian fell silent for a moment, and then she followed him.

In the spatial rift, waves of terrifying pressure and aura were ceaselessly surging out from those pillars there…

The mysterious expert looked up at the evil beasts above the pillars and said, “Let the prehistoric times return!”
