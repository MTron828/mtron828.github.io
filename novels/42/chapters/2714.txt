Chapter 2715 – I Don’t Need Your Damn Help!

Continue!

Yang Ye cracked a smile, and then he charged at Heng Wangu again.

His powerful sword energy could slice through anything!

Heng Wangu stopped moving, and then his feet slid slightly to opposite sides. He squatted partially there and swung a punch.

It caused the space before him to collapse!

Once space collapsed, the powerful force of the explosion and the energy within his fist instantly blasted Yang Ye and his sword away.

They flew over 3km away!

Yang Ye glanced at his right hand once he stopped there. His right hand had cracked open completely, and blood was seeping out incessantly from it.

Overwhelming strength!

Yang Ye took a deep breath and glanced at the surroundings.

The others were already in battle!

And it seemed like the End World had the upper hand!

Because they had more experts, and their peak and ordinary Destiny Realm experts were much more numerous than the experts on Yang Ye’s side.

He couldn’t delay!

Yang Ye looked up. Meanwhile, Heng Wangu suddenly took a step forward.

He instantly arrived before Yang Ye.

A punch!

Another punch!

It was going straight for Yang Ye’s head.

The power within it was sufficient to obliterate the world!

The power within it was telling Yang Ye that all techniques were useless before it.

Yang Ye closed his eyes slowly while his sword merged into one!

Past Life and Great Unknown had merged into one!

Yang Ye suddenly opened his eyes.

At the instant he opened his eyes, his entire figure turned blood red. At the same time, an extremely terrifying aura of the Sword Dao erupted from Yang Ye!

The Demonic Sword Dao!

Yang Ye had entered that state again.

Yang Ye swung his sword with both hands!

Boom!

Heng Wangu’s attack was instantly dispersed. At the same time, Heng Wangu was blasted over 1km away!

At this moment, countless experts gazed at Yang Ye!

Their expression changed when they noticed the aura he emanated!

At this moment, Yang Ye’s aura wasn’t something a peak Destiny Realm expert could compare to!

Did he take something?

All of them were filled with questions.

Heng Wangu glanced at his hand. There was an extremely deep injury on his fist, and if it went just a little deeper, the attack would have sliced his fist into two.

Heng Wangu looked up at Yang Ye, “I underestimated you. No, your strength exceeded my expectations.”

Yang Ye didn’t waste his breath and just charged forward.

Hiss!

Everywhere he passed, space was instantly sliced into bits!

Heng Wangu frowned slightly. Meanwhile, a sword arrived before him, and he pressed his elbows together to clamp down on it!

The sword descended!

Bang!

An explosion resounded, and then Heng Wangu was blasted over 1km away again! As soon as he stopped himself, Yang Ye was in front of him again, and another slash descended upon him!

Heng Wangu unfurled his right fist and slapped it upward.

Boom!

A wave of energy surged upward and slammed against Yang Ye’s sword. However, the energy failed to stop Yang Ye’s sword, and it still descended.

Bam!

Heng Wangu was blasted away once more.

Yang Ye charged over again.

Heng Wangu’s eyes narrowed slightly as he raised both hands. In an instant, a golden shield appeared around him, and a golden statue around 30m tall appeared behind him.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye arrived.

Heng Wangu pressed his palms together and slammed them forward.

Boom!

A wave of golden energy suddenly swept out of his palms, and they forcefully stopped Yang Ye’s sword. Meanwhile, Heng Wangu suddenly relaxed his palms and allowed Yang Ye’s sword to strike his head!

However, at practically the exact same moment, he slammed a punch at Yang Ye’s stomach.

Bang!

Yang Ye was instantly punched away!

But Yang Ye’s sword failed to slice off Heng Wangu’s head because the latter was enveloped in golden light, and the golden light had forcibly stopped Yang Ye’s sword! Of course, he’d dared to go head-on against Yang Ye’s attack mainly because he’d used his full strength to negate most of the energy contained within Yang Ye’s attack. Otherwise, he would have never dared to do that.

After he punched Yang Ye away, Heng Wangu didn’t stop. He immediately charged at Yang Ye.

The golden statue suddenly pressed its palms together behind him, and then it pressed its palms forward.

Yang Ye looked up at Heng Wangu, and he saw a golden fist slam down at him!

A vicious glow flashed through Yang Ye’s eyes. He stomped his right foot down and soared up into the air, and then he swung his sword with both hands!

The Domain Sword!

Meanwhile, Heng Wangu’s punch arrived.

Sword and fist collided.

Boom!

The space around them shook violently, and then they were pushed backward repeatedly!

Meanwhile, the golden statue behind Heng Wangu suddenly slammed a punch in Yang Ye’s direction!

A golden fist descended from the sky!

The space around Yang Ye instantly warped before it.

Meanwhile, at the center of it all, Yang Ye couldn’t even breathe.

A lethal feeling of oppression!

Yang Ye didn’t dare act carefully, and he shot up into the air while holding his sword with both hands!

At the same time, a sword chest suddenly appeared on his back. When he arrived just around 3m before the fist, the sword chest shook behind him, and then five swords surged up into the air and stabbed the golden fist.

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!

All give swords pierced through the fist, but the fist still descended.

Meanwhile, the sword in Yang Ye’s grasp slammed against the first. A moment later, a ray of sword energy shot through the fist.

However, as soon as Yang Ye passed through the fist, Heng Wangu appeared before him. The latter had formed a strange seal with both hands, and a strand of golden profound energy flowed throughout his body. After that, he gently pressed the seal downward.

Bang!

The space around Yang Ye instantly collapsed, and his figure was blasted over 3km away!

Heng Wangu was about to attack again when five swords suddenly shot at the golden statue behind him.

His eyes narrowed slightly as he took a step back, and the golden statue behind him moved over 100m back as well. After that, it pressed its palms together.

Boom!

A ray of golden light rippled out through space, and Yang Ye’s swords were instantly blasted away.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye appeared before Heng Wangu. At the same time, a few rays of sword energy enveloped the latter.

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!

Sword energy crisscrossed around Heng Wangu. However, the sword energy wasn't able to pierce through the golden shield around him!

However, cracks gradually appeared on the golden shield.

A few breaths of time later.

Along with the descent of Yang Ye’s sword, the golden shield shattered into bits, but at the instant that happened, Heng Wangu pushed forward and slammed a punch against Yang Ye’s chest.

Bam!

Yang Ye was instantly blasted away, but at the instant he flew away, he swung his sword and slashed off half of Heng Wangu’s right arm!

Yang Ye stopped far away in the distance, and as soon as he did that, a ray of sword energy suddenly appeared behind him!

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly as he turned around swiftly. A figure had arrived behind him. It was Mo Yu!

Hiss!

A sword stabbed Yang Ye’s chest, but it failed to stab through. Because Yang Ye’s armor appeared once more.

Meanwhile, a wisp of ridicule arose on the corners of Mo Yu’s mouth, and he pushed forward.Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Hiss!

The sword stabbed through Yang Ye’s chest!

It was Heaven Executor!

Mo Yu wasn’t holding an ordinary sword, he was holding one of the sharpest swords in the world, Heaven Executor!

As soon as it stabbed into Yang Ye’s body, a frenzied smile appeared on the corners of Mo Yu’s mouth. Because Heaven Executor was the most destructive sword in the world. Of course, the ordinary sword and Justice were excluded.

Once Heaven Executor entered the body, death was guaranteed. Because its powerful energy could destroy all vitality!

However, Mo Yu’s smile hadn’t stretched completely when it froze.

Yang Ye didn’t retreat, and he pressed forward instead, allowing Heaven Executor to pierce through his body. A moment later, he’d grabbed Mo Yu by the throat, and he just lifted him up like that.

Yang Ye had an extremely ferocious expression on his face. He suddenly pulled Mo Yu toward him, and then he raised his knee to strike Mo Yu’s chin.

Bam!

In an instant, Mo Yu’s chin and half his face was blasted into bits.

Heng Wangu was about to attack, but he suddenly stopped.

Heaven Executor suddenly shot out of Yang Ye’s body and slashed at his throat!

Yang Ye frowned slightly. He released Mo Yu, and then he turned around and swung his sword.

Bang!

Heaven Executor was instantly blasted away!

Meanwhile, Mo Yu was already over 1km away!

Mo Yu waved his hand, and Heaven Executor flew back into his grasp. He gazed fiercely at Yang Ye, “Haha! Yang Ye! Do you see that? Heaven Executor has acknowledged me as its master! It’s willing to accept me as its master! Haha!”

Heaven Executor had acknowledged him as its master!

Yang Ye glanced at his stomach. At this moment, a strand of mysterious energy was devouring his stomach!

The energy of Heaven Executor!

After a moment of silence, Yang Ye suddenly appeared before Mo Yu. The latter’s expression changed as he pressed his sword against his forehead. A moment later, countless rays of sword energy swept out from him. However, along with a swing of Yang Ye’s sword, the sword energy was completely obliterated!

At this moment, Yang Ye was in his Demonic Sword Dao state, so even an old geezer like Heng Wangu didn’t dare to underestimate him at all!

Along with the sword energy being dispersed, a sword pressed against Mo Yu’s throat.

Meanwhile, Heaven Executor had only been lifted, and it was still a distance away from Yang Ye’s throat!

Mo Yu’s expression was extremely unsightly!

Meanwhile, a voice suddenly resounded in Yang Ye’s mind, “Can you give him to me? If you agree, I can help you repulse your enemies!”

Yang Ye looked up at the sky, “I don’t need your damn help!”

As soon as he said that, he twisted his sword.

Hiss!

Mo Yu’s head flew up into the air.
