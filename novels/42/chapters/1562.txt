In order to prove that the attacks on the demon race weren’t related to the Human Alliance, the Human Alliance specially dispatched its forces to the Phoenix Domain and expressed their willingness to help in the capture of Yang Ye.

The Human Alliance was an alliance formed by many formidable powers in the Human Territory. It represented the entire human race. If the human race was attacked, then all the powers in the Human Territory would have to obey the Human Alliance.

Because the Human Alliance stepped forward and proved that it wasn’t involved in the attack, the war which was about to erupt between the human race and demon race had been calmed. After that, the demon race locked its sights on Yang Ye.

Yang Ye and the forces standing behind him were provoking the demon race!

Obviously, Yang Ye became the number one enemy of the demon race.

It wasn’t just the demon race, the Human Alliance blacklisted Yang Ye as well. In short, Yang Ye had become a common enemy of the human race and demon race.

At this moment, Yang Ye was still unaware of that. But he wouldn’t care even if he was aware.

Because he had more than enough enemies, so a few more didn’t make a difference. After all, one stopped worrying when there was too much to worry about.

…

Oblivion Boundary City. The Goat Pub.

Ding Shaoyao’s eyes were closed tight while she sat in an arm-chair within her room. A long time passed before she suddenly spoke softly, “Mysterious experts snuck into the Demon Territory. The Devil Ape Clan, Phantom Fox Clan, and Heavenly Dragon Clan lost over 10,000 demon beasts each. However, most of them were at the Deity Realm or below. That proves that they weren’t really trying to help Yang Ye. As for what they said about the demon race being doomed if Yang Ye dies, they were clearly trying to create enmity for Yang Ye!”

She remained silent for a long time before she spoke again, “Not long after the incident at the Demon Territory, the Human Alliance immediately guaranteed that it had no connection to Yang Ye. Moreover, it was even willing to capture Yang Ye. Is the Human Alliance acting against Yang Ye? No, while the War Pavilion and Emperor Sect have some influence, it’s impossible for them to be capable of influencing the entire Human Alliance. The one pulling the strings isn’t them!”

Ding Shaoyao’s eyes suddenly opened, “If it isn’t them, then who? Who possesses such power? The experts they sent were actually able to move freely through the Demon Territory. Such strength… Moreover, they can even influence the Human Alliance. Who is it? Why are they targeting Yang Ye?”

After pondering deeply for a long time, Ding Shaoyao suddenly stood up, “Yang Ye isn’t their target. If Yang Ye was their target, they wouldn’t have gone to such lengths to create enemies for him. Based on the strength they’ve revealed, they’re entirely capable of killing Yang Ye. Their target isn’t Yang Ye, but they are acting against him…”

Ding Shaoyao’s pupils suddenly constricted, “The Nether Pavilion! They want to force Yang Ye into a hopeless situation and draw out the Nether Pavilion.”

The reason she thought of the Nether Pavilion was because it was quite close with Yang Ye. Moreover, besides the Nether Pavilion, no one else could save Yang Ye from the current situation that he was in. Besides that, the Nether Pavilion was the only force that may try to save Yang Ye.

Ding Shaoyao was instantly enlightened when she thought up to this point.

She was naturally aware of the Nether Pavilion, and she’d investigated it. After she investigated the Nether Pavilion, she’d felt worried for Yang Ye. Because the situation was absolutely complicated. How strong was the Nether Pavilion? Yet it was still forced to flee to the lower dimensions. So, she could imagine how powerful that power which was acting against the Nether Pavilion from the shadows was!

But Yang Ye was so close to the Nether Pavilion, so trouble would definitely come for him. Sure enough, what she was worried about had occurred.

Yang Ye was being used like a pawn!

Ding Shaoyao remained silent for a long time, and then she looked off into the distance. There was lost expression in her eyes, “Will the Nether Pavilion come? If you don’t come, he’ll definitely die!”

…

In the bamboo house on that unknown mountain range.

A woman was playing Go by herself. A long time passed before a charming smile curled up on her face, “Sister of the Nether Pavilion, will you show yourselves? I really look forward to your arrival!”

When she spoke up to this point, she suddenly turned to look at a corner of the house, “Don’t worry, the person you love has the most tenacious destiny that I’ve ever seen. He’ll definitely be able to persist until the Nether Pavilion comes to save him. Of course, even if he can’t hold on until then, I’ll still send you there to meet him one last time.”

As soon as she finished speaking, silence filled the surroundings, and only the sound of Go pieces being placed could be heard.

…

The Phoenix Domain.

After he recovered his profound energy, Yang Ye was about to continue destroying Phoenix Domain. However, Little Sky stopped him.

She glanced at the sky and said, “I sense numerous powerful auras. A huge amount of them. They’ve covered the entire Phoenix Domain. They’ll definitely detect you as soon as you head outside and do something. Once they detect you, you’ll be finished. So, you can’t go out there!”

Yang Ye frowned, “Numerous powerful auras? Rebirth Realm experts?”

Little Sky nodded.

Yang Ye asked, “How many?”

She fell silent for a moment and replied, “Over 50 at the very least!”

Yang Ye’s eyes instantly narrowed slightly. Over 50 Rebirth Realm experts! The Divine Phoenix Clan definitely didn’t have that many. So, in other words, the Divine Phoenix Clan had sought help.

“You can’t go outside, and you can’t leave the Phoenix Domain as well!” Little Sky continued, “They’ve covered the entire area with their divine sense. Even though you can fully conceal your aura, they’ll definitely detect your presence if you head outside. Because they are searching for you. Once you head outside, your movement will definitely cause faint changes in space, and they’ll definitely be able to detect those faint changes while they are focused on locating you. So long as they locate you, you’ll be surrounded in an instant!”

Yang Ye fell silent.

Little Sky shook her head and said, “You’re in big trouble this time.”

The current situation Yang Ye was in was really a hopeless one. A truly hopeless situation!

Those Rebirth Realm experts were waiting for Yang Ye to head outside. They couldn’t locate him while he stayed within the Primordial Pagoda, but they would definitely start to search for him if he didn’t show himself after some time. However, Yang Ye was trapped within the Phoenix Domain, so it was only a matter of time before they found him!

Once they found Yang Ye, he would definitely lose his life!

Even the Stellar Sword Diagram couldn’t save him!

Unless Yang Ye attained the Rebirth Realm or Dualism Realm. Because so long as he attained the Dualism Realm, his strength and the assistance of the Stellar Sword Diagram would be sufficient to give him a good chance to escape this place.

But the problem was that Yang Ye was still a Deity right now!

Yang Ye remained silent for a long time, and then he gazed at Little Sky. The latter shook her head, “I’m sorry, but I don’t know how to fight. I really don’t.”

Yang Ye smiled, “I don’t plan to ask you to help me fight them.”

Little Sky was puzzled, “Then what?”

Yang Ye said, “Little Sky, even though I don’t know who you are, we’re friends. Such a situation is truly hopeless for me. If you continue staying with me, you’ll definitely be unable to escape death. So, leave. I know that you’ll definitely be able to escape if you want to.”

Little Sky gazed at Yang Ye for a long time and said, “Why don’t we go discuss the matter with them? Let’s all just sit down and talk about it…”

Yang Ye smiled as he rubbed her head, “Oh you! You’re so naïve. Not to mention you, even the Lord of the Heaven Dao wouldn’t be able to reconcile us. Listen to me and just leave. I’m their target. So, they won’t pursue you if you’re not with me. Even if they do, they won’t send many experts after you. Understand?”

Little Sky fell silent for a long time, and then she said, “Let me stay with you.”

“You…”

Yang Ye was about to say something when Little Sky interrupted him, “I won’t die. Even if you’re killed, I still won’t die. I don’t know why I won’t die. In any case, I won’t. At the very least, they aren’t capable of killing me. Even that flame of yours can’t kill me. No, perhaps it can try. However, I think that even it can’t kill me. Of course, the exception would be if it’s controlled by its original owner.”

The Divine Yin Flame!

Yang Ye naturally knew which flame she was referring to. It was the Divine Yin Flame, of course!

Yang Ye gazed at Little Sky for a very long time, and then he said, “Alright, you can stay.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye went to the 2nd level of the Primordial Pagoda.

Yang Ye walked over to the pill furnace. Little Sky Flame immediately flew into Yang Ye’s arms when she saw him. Yang Ye rubbed her head and gazed at the Divine Yin Flame, “I need your help!”

The Divine Phoenix Clan had gotten help, so he intended to do so as well!

The Divine Yin Flame remained silent.

Yang Ye gazed at it for a long time, and then he said, “I won’t force you.”

Yang Ye turned around and walked away.

Suddenly, a voice resounded, “You can’t endure my strength!”

I have a chance! Yang Ye turned around and gazed at the Divine Ying Flame, “My body is very strong.”

The Divine Yin Flame replied, “It’s not enough. It wouldn’t be strong enough even if it’s ten times stronger.”

Yang Ye asked, “You can’t leave on your own?”

The Divine Yin Flame replied, “I can’t!”

Yang Ye asked, “Why?”

“Because I’m confined here!” The Divine Ying Flame said, “Don’t ask me why. I can only tell you that if you want my help, then you must be able to endure my strength. Because I have to use you as a medium in order to extend my strength to the world outside. But if I transfer my energy to you right now, you’ll be transformed into ashes in an instant!”

Yang Ye remained silent for a long time, and then he activated the energy of the Demon God. As soon as that happened, his body immediately underwent a tremendous change.

At this moment, his body was at least five times stronger than before!

That wasn’t the end of it. Yang Ye immediately activated the Sword God’s Seal and raised his sword intent to the Returnal Rank. After that, he used his dual intents to form layers around himself. At the same time, the Primordial Violet Energy within him transformed into a violet barrier of light that covered him.

Meanwhile, the Divine Ying Flame said, “It’ll still be very dangerous!”

Yang Ye shook his head, “It doesn’t matter! Let’s do it! I just hope you’re strong enough!”

“Strong enough?” The Divine Ying Flame suddenly started roaring with laughter, “If my main body can leave this place, I can even incinerate this entire universe!”

As soon as he finished speaking, the Divine Ying Flame suddenly flashed out from the pill furnace and entered the center of Yang Ye’s forehead.

Bang!

In an instant, Yang Ye was covered in flames.

A moment later…

Boom!

A huge area around Yang Ye was instantly incinerated and vanished!

At the same time, all the flames throughout Phoenix Domain had started to shiver madly.
