Chapter 2349 – Such a Sword Actually Exists!

Decide on life and death!

Yang Ye gazed at Tian Xiu with astonishment, and he wondered if she was being serious!

Suddenly, the purple bamboo forest shook, and then they parted. At the same time, a bamboo leaf floated out from within.

A purple bamboo leaf!

It floated over slowly, light as a feather, and without any fluctuations of energy.

It was slow and light!

That was what Yang Ye felt!

But his intuition told him that if he got close to it, he would die in an instant!

Tian Xiu’s eyes narrowed slightly. She stretched out her right hand and clamped down upon it with two fingers.

It shook slightly but was very calm.

Just like that, this continued for a long, long time before Tian Xiu suddenly flicked it, and it transformed into a ray of violet light that shot into the bamboo forest.

In the bamboo forest, there was no further sound from it, nor was there any movement!

A long time later, an aged voice came from within, “Please come in!”

As soon as the voice resounded, the bamboo forest split apart, and then a small pathway appeared before them.

Tian Xiu led Yang Ye into the bamboo forest, and she spoke indifferently while they walked, “Did you see the force that leaf carried earlier?”

Yang Ye shook his head.

She explained, “Even if you used the Primordial Axe of Creation and your full strength, you still wouldn’t be able to stop it!”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

Tian Xiu spoke softly, “It’s called Limitbreaker, a force capable of destroying a world. This expert before us can merge that energy into a bamboo leaf without harming it at all, and this proves that he’s at the peak of the realm or even higher.”

Yang Ye glanced at her and remained silent.

The expert in the depths of the bamboo forest was able to merge the energy sufficient to destroy a world within a single leaf, and it was obvious how strong that expert was. However, Tian Xiu had been able to deal with it perfectly, and this showed that Tian Xiu’s strength was at a terrifying level as well!

Yang Ye had undergone a tremendous improvement in strength after arriving here, but both the Unfettered One and Tian Xiu were growing stronger too!

Yang Ye wasn’t the only one who was growing stronger!

It didn’t take long for Tian Xiu to stop, and there was a violet bamboo house ahead. A stream flowed before it, and an old man was seated by the stream. His feet were in it as he allowed the water to slowly brush against his feet.

The old man wore a gray robe that was very long and almost long enough to fall into the water. There was a tea table to his right, and two white cups and a teapot were on it!

The old man waved his right hand lightly, and one of them appeared before Tian Xiu. Meanwhile, Snowy emerged. She glanced at the white cup, sniffed it, and then gazed at Tian Xiu.

Tian Xiu glanced at the cup and spoke softly, “Bodhi Dew, a Pseudo Divine Treasure. A normal person’s body would undergo a tremendous change upon consuming it. It’ll truly cleanse their bodies.”

She glanced at Yang Ye and continued, “You can forget about it. Even a Divine Treasure may not work on you.”

Yang Ye was quite embarrassed. His body was frequently being nourished by Primordial Violet Energy, so normal Divine Treasures really couldn’t compare to it.

Tian Xiu didn’t drink and passed the cup to Snowy instead. Snowy immediately drank it all, and then she licked her lips and seemed to still be unsatisfied. It didn’t take long for her to look at the old man, or to be more precise, she gazed at the white teapot.

Snowy gazed at Yang Ye and pointed at the teapot.

She was clearly asking him to go get it!

Yang Ye’s face darkened. He glared at Snowy and said, “Go get it yourself!”

Snowy glanced at the old man and was slightly hesitant. Her instinct told her that this old man wasn’t a nice person.

Meanwhile, the old man waved his right hand lightly, and the teapot flew over to Snowy, “It’s for you.”

Snowy’s eyes lit up. She didn’t know what being courteous was at all, and she just grabbed it and started drinking.

Tian Xiu walked over to the stream and said, “Don’t have much time left?”

The old man nodded, “Every time I try to traverse the river, I lose thousands of years of lifespan, so I don’t have much left to lose.”

Tian Xiu asked, “Is it very difficult?”

The old man replied softly, “Very.”

Tian Xiu said, “It’s our own effort that determines our success!”

The old man grinned, “What about you? When will you be going there?”

Tian Xiu shook her head slightly, “Not for now. I have many things to do.”

The old man fell silent.

Tian Xiu suddenly asked, “What do you think about my brother?”

The old man fell silent for a long time before he said, “He can be considered to be outstanding.”

Tian Xiu closed her eyes slowly, “I’m here to ask for a favor. I wonder if you’ll agree.”

The old man fell silent.

Tian Xiu spoke softly, “You still have 100 years of lifespan. Just 10 years, don’t act against him for 10 years, and you can do as you please after that. Alright?”

The old man said, “To be honest, even I can’t avoid being tempted by a Sprite Progenitor. However…” The old man stood up slowly and gazed at Yang Ye, “I’m willing to give you the favor. But I want this young brother to return the favor in the future.”

Yang Ye unconsciously asked, “How?”

The old man smiled. He didn’t say anything and just entered the bamboo house.

“Let’s go!” Meanwhile, Tian Xiu suddenly spoke and walked away.

Yang Ye hurriedly followed her, “Tian Xiu…”

Tian Xiu said softly, “Remember that if you survive, and this little fellow advances, then if he comes to you, help him if it’s within your ability.”

She paused for a moment and continued, “10 years. While it’s 10, you must remember that if you can’t deal with the other powers, then it’s very likely that he will act against you.”

Yang Ye was about to speak when Tian Xiu added, “Perhaps you’re wondering why I’m not helping you deal with those powers hiding in the shadows. They dare not act against you while I’m here, but if I act against them, they will join forces. Coupled with those guardians of this world, the outcome will be one where both sides suffer severe losses. What I mean is they will die, but so will you. I can take Snowy and leave now, and attract their attention for you, but they will definitely use you to threaten me and make me bring Snowy back!”

She stopped and looked back at him, “I can take you with me too. If Snowy hadn’t been exposed, taking you with me would be an option. Yet now, if I take you with me, they will still join forces to stop me. Moreover, those others from the large universe, including those friends of yours will die. They will use them to force you to show yourself. If that sword cultivator isn’t included, I won’t lose to anyone here in a one on one battle, even that old man from before, I can still kill him. But I would have to pay a small price. However, if they join forces, then coupled with those guardians of this world, even I would find it difficult to keep myself alive!”

Yang Ye fell silent.

Tian Xiu continued, “We’ve formed a balance right now. They dare not attack while I’m here because they don’t want to go down with me. As for me, if I want you to survive, then I cannot choose to take them down with me. In the end, I’ve dealt with the strongest experts for you, the experts at the Limitbreaker Realm. However, you have to deal with the rest of them!”

Yang Ye spoke solemnly, “I know. I must walk my own path.”

Tian Xiu nodded, “I have some time, so let me take you to the final place.”

She vanished on the spot with Yang Ye.

The Sword Ruins.

Tian Xiu led Yang Ye to the Sword Ruins, and Jian You had a solemn expression on her face as she gazed at Tian Xiu.

Tian Xiu glanced at Jian You and said, “I want to see that sword!”

Jian You fell silent.

Tian Xiu looked toward the depths of the Sword Ruins. At this moment, her gaze had pierced through the Sword Ruins. In the end, she saw what she wanted deep within the area.

Tian Xiu’s face gradually turned solemn.

A long time later, Tian Xiu withdrew her gaze and closed her eyes slowly, “Such a sword actually exists…”

Jian You gazed at Tian Xiu in silence.

Tian Xiu gazed at Yang Ye, “Don’t think about it. Just cultivate well here, I’m going out for a while. Perhaps I’ll return, perhaps I won’t. If I don’t return, do everything you can to survive.”

Tian Xiu turned around and left without the slightest hesitation!

“Tian Xiu!” Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly appeared before Tian Xiu. She gazed at him in silence.

Yang Ye rubbed her head lightly, “I’ll live well, so you live well too, alright?”

Tian Xiu gazed at Yang Ye for a long time and said, “It isn’t difficult for a person to live in this world, but to live with dignity and freedom is very difficult. Your character is one that would rather break than bend, you would rather die than cower. So, your life is even more difficult. No matter what, live well, live well with Snowy!”

Tian Xiu’s figure gradually turned ethereal.

She’s left!

Tian Xiu had left again!Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Yang Ye looked up at the sky and was quite bewildered. He wondered if he would ever see her again. His intuition told him that this parting might last for eternity!

A long time passed before Yang Ye withdrew his gaze and looked at Jian You, “Two weeks, I’ll leave in two weeks.”

She fell silent.

Yang Ye walked over to a nearby tree and sat down cross-legged.

A short while later, he entered the Primordial Pagoda.

In the cultivation room, Yang Ye clenched his fists slowly, and then a wave of terrifying intent swept out from within him!

Madness intent!

Yang Ye had taken the initiative to release it!

Once it appeared, Yang Ye wasn’t normal anymore. But it didn’t take long for his sword intent and slaughter intent to appear.

Bang!

The two intents immediately pounced at the madness intent!

Balance!

He planned to fully control the madness intent!

It was very dangerous, and the slightest mistake might result in his death. But he wanted to give it a shot.

He had to try!

…

Far away in space. Tian Xiu walked slowly.

Suddenly, six extremely powerful auras appeared, and they immediately surrounded her.

Tian Xiu closed her eyes slowly, “Six Limitbreaker Realm experts. Looks like you still plan on trying. But that’s fine too. I would have gone to you anyway. Even if I can’t kill you, I’ll cripple you all. Otherwise, how would someone young like him fight against old geezers like you?”

Boom!

Something appeared in Tian Xiu’s grasp once she finished speaking!

Netherworld Destiny!
