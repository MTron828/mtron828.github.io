It wasn’t that he couldn’t consider the overall situation.

It wasn’t that Yang Ye didn’t understand how making compromise would result in no further problems.

But so what?

Did the secret court care about all of that? They didn’t. They dared to seize his prisoners because they possessed strength, and they felt that it was a matter of course that he should willingly hand those prisoners over to them. They had never thought about how the yellow robed man and white wolf hadn’t been captured by then, and they were Yang Ye’s prisoners instead!

Why didn’t they? Why did they dare to act in that way? Because they felt that they were strong. Did the strong have to care about the overall situation when dealing with the weak? Of course they would, but they would say that Yang Ye was the one who didn’t consider the situation and was acting selfishly by being unwilling to hand the white wolf and yellow robed man over to them!

They didn’t care who captured the white wolf and yellow robed man, nor did they care whether Yang Ye who captured those 2 would agree to hand his prisoners over to them. As far as they were concerned, since their secret court needed the yellow robed man and white wolf, then they would take them. Because the secret court was stronger than the outer court!

Unfortunately, their strengths were insufficient, and Yang Ye had pushed them back.

However, the secret court didn’t choose to make a compromise upon suffering such a defeat, it chose to take revenge!

Were they wrong? No. Their companions had been beaten up, so it wasn’t wrong to take revenge. If someone was wrong, it was Hao Shuaibo and the others. Because they didn’t possess sufficient strength, so they could only blame their lack of ability when suffering a beating from the secret court!

Similarly, could Yang Ye’s intention to take revenge be considered as doing something wrong?

Yang Ye didn’t know how others thought about it, and he didn’t care. Because he felt that he wasn’t wrong.

Since he wasn’t wrong, then he intended to do as he wanted!

As they watched Yang Ye’s group walk in the direction of where the secret court’s members were, Shang Qingying and the others had unsightly expressions on their faces. Because they knew Yang Ye well, and they knew that the matter would become irreconcilable once he arrived there. At this moment, they were facing powerful enemies, and were facing internal strife as well. So, it was definitely a calamity to Ocean of Clouds City!

“Instructor Shang, what should we do?” One of the inner court students spoke in a heavy voice.

Shang Qingying remained silent for a short while, and then she shook her head and said, “Those fellows from the secret court are arrogant and stubborn, they won’t listen to my advice at all. As for Yang Ye, he’s worse than them. I would just be wasting my energy if I tried to advise them further.”

That student asked, “Then are we just going to watch as they fight each other?”

Shang Qingying fell silent for a short while and said, “Go get Gu Qianfan!”

Suddenly, Yang Ye stopped moving, and then he turned around to look at Shang Qingying and the others, “I wonder if all of you still remember that bet of ours?”

Shang Qingying and the others were slightly stunned, and then they had quite dark expressions on their faces. They naturally remembered the bet. As for the outcome.... Yang Ye had slaughtered a few hundred thousand demon beasts, so wasn’t it obvious?

Yang Ye continued, “I forgot about it because of what happened to Zi’er. Fortunately, I recalled it now. I don’t like people who don’t keep their word, so I hope that all of you will fulfil your promises. Don’t make me watch all of you as you do it, otherwise it would be quite embarrassing for all of you. Besides that, Instructor Shang, come to my residence to get my clothes once you’re done here!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye led the others forward, and it didn’t take long for them to vanish from Shang Qingying and the others’ fields of vision.

“He seemed to....” One of the inner court students by Shang Qingying’s side spoke solemnly, “Carry hostility towards us....”

There was a slightly complicated expression in Shang Qingying’s eyes, “Of course he does. If I’d done something when that demon beast of his was jointly attacked by the white wolf and yellow robed man, then even if I wasn’t able to save that violet mink, it wouldn’t have suffered such heavy injuries.”

“How can he blame you for that?” That student felt that it wasn’t right, “You were controlling the formation with us, and you even were the core of the formation. You couldn’t have left! If he really intends to blame you for that violet mink’s injuries, then I would really look down on him!”

“He doesn’t blame me!” Shang Qingying shook her head slightly, “Actually, the relationship between his outer court and our inner court had eased up slightly. While we weren’t in absolute harmony with each other, there was no hostility between us anymore. As for me and him, even though we couldn’t be considered as friends, we couldn’t be considered as unfamiliar as well. But now that he mentioned that bet, he intends to tell us that we’re no different than the secret court to him. We’ll all maintain a peaceful relationship if we don’t offend each other, but if we act against him....”

All the others behind her came to an immediate understanding.

Actually, they could have become friends with Yang Ye and the outer court, but Yang Ye’s actions were telling them that he didn’t want to be friends with them.

Shang Qingying shot her gaze towards the boundless mountain range outside the city, “Enemies waiting outside and chaos within. The city’s future is worrying....”

Yang Ye and the others didn’t go far before an army appeared in front of them. The army was composed of over a thousand experts, and every single one of them was at the Exalt Realm while the leader of the army was the city governor of Ocean of Clouds City, Helian Feng!

Helian Feng gazed at Yang Ye with a gloomy expression on his face, “Earlier, I didn’t quite believe it when Young Brother Zuo Xiu told me that you disregard the rules of the academy, act ruthlessly, fearlessly, and kill on a whim. But now, I have to believe him. A person like you....”

Yang Ye waved his hand and interrupted Helian Feng, “Who’re you?”

Yu Wushuang suddenly walked over to Yang Ye’s side and spoke, “He’s the city governor!”

Yang Ye’s eyes instantly narrowed. Meanwhile, Helian Feng was about to say something but Yang Ye spoke before him, “I’d intended to go look for you, but I never expected you to come to me instead. Since you’re here, then there’s no need to leave. Right, cut the crap as well!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye flipped his palm, and the Herculean Sword appeared in his grasp. Once it was in his grasp, Yang Ye’s figure vanished on the spot.

Helian Feng’s pupils constricted at the exact same instant that Yang Ye vanished, and his profound energy instantly surged instinctively in reaction to the danger he sensed. It formed a thick barrier of energy around him!

Bang!

The barrier had only just formed when Helian Feng felt a huge amount of force strike him, and the barrier instantly cracked apart. Moreover, his figure was pushed backwards by the force of the collision, and his figure only stopped after being pushed over 1km away!

There was a solemn expression in Helian Feng’s eyes!

Yang Ye had a slightly solemn expression in his eyes as well. Because he’d utilized the Laws of Speed earlier, but Helian Feng had still been able to react at the critical moment! L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“You.... That’s the energy of the Laws....” Helian Feng stared fixedly at Yang Ye. Meanwhile, the other soldiers around him had recovered from their shock and immediately surrounded Yang Ye’s group.

Yang Ye didn’t waste his breath. He utilized the Laws of Speed again and immediately appeared in front of Helian Feng, and then the Herculean Sword smashed down at Helian Feng.

It was swift, too swift. It was swift to the point no one besides Helian Feng was able to detect Yang Ye’s movements.

Helian Feng’s expression had changed drastically when Yang Ye attacked. This time, he didn’t choose to be on the defensive. A terrifying aura instantly surged out from within him, and a white ray of light followed right behind the aura. Both of them swept out in succession and obstructed Yang Ye who’d arrived in front of him!

Yang Ye didn’t stop, and he swung the Herculean Sword instead!

Bang!

An explosion resounded as Helian Feng’s aura and the white ray of light were instantly blasted apart. Meanwhile, Helian Feng had appeared over 1km away. Moreover, there were numerous strands of white light floating around him.

“Kill!” Helian Feng hadn’t even given the order but the soldiers in the surroundings had already charged at Yang Ye.

Hiss!

A ray of light flashed, and then the heads of over 100 soldiers flew into the air while accompanied by fountains of blood. However, their bodies were still charging forward because Yang Ye’s attack was truly too swift!

Everyone stopped moving and none dared to charge forward again!

After all, he’d killed over 100 Exalt Realm experts with a swing of his sword!

The soldiers gazed at Yang Ye with astonishment. They weren’t just shocked by his strength; they were shocked by his boldness as well. Because he’d actually dared to kill, and he’d even killed so many in one go!

“How dare you!” Helian Feng was furious when he witnessed this scene, and he shot explosively towards Yang Ye while surrounded by countless rays of white light.

Helian Feng was extremely swift, and he’d appeared in front of Yang Ye at the same moment his voice resounded. At the same time, the white rays of light instantly enveloped Yang Ye.

Bang! Bang! Bang!

Explosions resounded incessantly as rays of white light and sword energy collided from all directions. Everyone here was astounded by this scene and hurriedly shot backwards!

One of the inner court students by Shang Qingying’s side spoke in a serious tone, “Who’ll win?”

Shang Qingying didn’t even hesitate, “Ye Yang!”

“Why?” The student was puzzled, “City Governor Helian is a high rank Half-Saint, and he attained the high rank of the Half-Saint Realm a few dozens of years ago. Ye Yang is only at the Monarch Realm....”

Shang Qingying didn’t speak. She just stared fixedly at the battle.

The battle continued for a while, and then it went silent.

The white light and sword energy dispersed.

Yang Ye and Helian Feng’s figures appeared before them. Yang Ye was standing while Helian Feng was lying on the ground. Helian Feng’s entire body was densely covered in injuries while blood flowed out incessantly from them. In an instant, a small pool of blood formed beneath his body, but he was still alive.

That student by Shang Qingying’s side quickly said, “Instructor Shang, quickly stop him!”

Shang Qingying shook her head, “I can’t!”

Yang Ye paid no attention to Helian Feng, and he gazed at Yu Wushuang instead, “Look through them and see if any of them attacked all of you earlier!”

Yu Wushuang didn’t try to dissuade Yang Ye this time. She glanced at the soldiers and started pointing at them....

Every single time she pointed, a ray of light would flash, and then a head would fly into the air.

Just like that, Yu Wushuang pointed incessantly while rays of light flashed without end!
