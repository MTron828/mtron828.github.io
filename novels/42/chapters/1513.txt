Chapter 1514 - Three Strikes Is All It’ll Take!

Translator: InVader

Arrogant!

Extremely arrogant!

Absolutely arrogant!

Their expressions became unsightly when they heard Yang Ye. Join forces? Asking them to join forces was no different than looking down on them!

As the number one power of the Western Territory, the disciples of the Martial Sect definitely had their own pride!

“I’ll fight you!” Sure enough, a man with a sword in his hand appeared in front of Yang Ye.

Someone exclaimed, “It’s Senior Brother Cang Mu!”

“Hehe! Senior Brother Cang Mu’s sword intent is at the Rebirth Rank. Tsk, tsk. How many moves do you think that fellow, Yang Ye, will be able to resist?”

“Three!”

“Are you looking down on Yang Ye?”

“Four! No more than that!”

“Haha!”

Roaring laughter resounded through the surroundings.

Yang Ye glanced at Cang Mu, “A sword cultivator?”

Cang Mu twisted his figure slightly and pointed his sword towards the ground as he said, “The Western Territory’s number one sword cultivator!”

“The number one sword cultivator?” Yang Ye was stunned, and then he shook his head and smiled. Even though he rarely met any people capable of being a match for him in the Sword Dao, he never dared to call himself the number one sword cultivator. The world was so huge, and there were so many experts. So who dares to say they are the best in a certain aspect? Those who call themselves the best are mostly ignorant people.

“Three strikes!” Meanwhile, Cang Mu spoke abruptly, “I’ll defeat you with three strikes!”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

Cang Mu didn’t speak another word. He closed his eyes slowly. At the instant he did, a sword howl resounded from his sword. Besides that, the space around him started rippling like a still lake struck by a rock. At the same time, a terrifying wave of sword intent appeared around him!

Rebirth Rank sword intent!

Yang Ye nodded slightly as he gazed at Cang Mu. Even though Cang Mu was slightly overconfident, his strength and natural talent weren’t bad at all. Yang Ye was experienced, so he knew what one had to experience in order to attain Rebirth Rank sword intent. Since Cang Mu could overcome such difficulties and attain rebirth of his sword intent, Cang Mu was definitely not an ordinary person!

“Senior Brother Cang Mu is going to execute Spirit Pierce!”

Everyone stared at Cang Mu without blinking. Their eyes were filled with excitement, anticipation, and a wisp of nervousness.

Cang Mu’s eyes were closed tightly while his aura rose incessantly. Obviously, he was accumulating strength.

Suddenly, Yang Ye appeared in front of Cang Mu, and then he grabbed Cang Mu by the throat before the latter could even react!

Everyone was stunned by this scene.

Including Cang Mu!

“Yang Ye! You broke the rules!” Suddenly, a furious shout resounded from afar.

Yang Ye turned to look at its source, and he saw a young man. At this moment, the young man was glaring angrily at him, and seemed like he wanted to charge over and fight Yang Ye!

Yang Ye was quite curious, “How did I break the rules?”

The man spoke angrily, “It hasn’t even begun, yet you attacked? You broke the rules!”

“It hasn’t begun?” A smile curled up on the corners of Yang Ye’s mouth. He glanced at the surroundings and said, “Is this what the disciples of the Martial Sect are like?”

The young man was furious. He was about to speak when Cang Mu spoke abruptly, “I’ve lost!”

The young man’s expression changed, and then he gazed at Cang Mu, “Senior Brother Cang Mu, you haven’t lost. He launched a surprise attack. If you were able to utilize your technique, then he wouldn’t have been able to resist it!”

“How laughable!” Yang Ye gazed at the young man, “Would you give your enemy time to execute a powerful technique? Would you?”

The young man’s face froze, but it didn’t take long for him to speak again, “This isn’t a battle of life and death. It’s a spar, a fair spar! You actually launched a surprise attack during a spar! How despicable of you!”

Many others in the surroundings nodded and glared angrily at Yang Ye.

Yang Ye shook his head, “What nonsense.” He gazed at the young man and continued, “I’m going to attack you!”

The young man was stunned. A moment later, Yang Ye appeared in front of the young man, and the latter wasn’t even able to react before Yang Ye’s hand clamped down on his throat.

Everyone here was stunned again!

Speed!

Absolute speed!

Their expressions became extremely solemn when they recovered from their shock.

Yang Ye raised the young man in front of him and said, “So, did I launch a surprise attack this time?”

The young man's face became ashen. What was it like to be slapped on the face? This was it!

Yang Ye released the young man, and then he gazed at Cang Mu, “Out of consideration for An Nanjing, I can give you another chance. Come, execute your attack!”

Cang Mu gazed at Yang Ye for a long time before he said. “You’re very strong!” At this moment, even an idiot could realize that Yang Ye was extremely strong.

Suddenly, the young man from before shouted, “Senior Brother Cang Mu! You can do it!”

At the same time, many others in the surroundings started to shout with him.

Cang Mu glanced at Yang Ye, and then he slowly closed his eyes. Just like before, a wave of sword intent appeared around him. At the same time, his sword started to tremble violently.

A moment of silence later, Cang Mu suddenly opened his eyes, “Spirit Pierce!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he swung his sword.

Sword energy that was fine like a thread of hair shot towards Yang Ye in an extremely strange manner. Once it arrived in front of Yang Ye, Yang Ye stretched out his hand with the intent of stopping it. However, this made the lips of many form an arc. Especially that young man from before. There even was a wisp of ridicule on the corners of his mouth!

Right when Yang Ye was about to stop the sword energy, it suddenly entered the space before Yang Ye. Yang Ye was stunned, and a moment later, the sword energy slammed against his body.

“Hahaha!” Meanwhile, the young man roared with laughter, “What an idiot! That technique contains the energy of the five elements. Yang Ye, do you know what the energy of the five elements is? It ignores all forms of defenses created by profound energy. So, trying to stop it by force is like courting death! You…”

The young man’s voice stopped abruptly.

Because he noticed that Yang Ye was looking at him like he was an idiot.

The young man stared at Yang Ye, “You’re… you’re fine!”

The young man wasn’t the only one who reacted like that, the others were looking at Yang Ye too.

They saw the sword energy strike Yang Ye, but Yang Ye seemed to be completely fine!

What’s going on?

At this moment, there was a puzzled expression in Cang Mu’s eyes. Suddenly, he seemed to have thought of something, and his countenance instantly turned ghastly pale while disbelief filled his eyes as he gazed at Yang Ye.

Yang Ye patted his chest and said, “It was sharp and carried the energy of the five elements. Not bad.”

“You… you cheated!” Suddenly, the young man shouted. He pointed at Yang Ye and spoke angrily, “You’re definitely carrying some sort of powerful treasure! You…”

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly when the young man refused to stop, and Yang Ye’s gaze gradually became icy cold.

“Shut your mouth!” Suddenly, a voice resounded, and then a middle aged man in a luxurious robe appeared here.

The expressions of everyone here instantly changed slightly at the sight of him, and then they bowed to the middle aged man, “Sect Master!”

The middle aged man nodded slightly, and then he gazed at that young man, “Go stand in front of a wall. You can leave when you realize your mistakes!”

The young man’s face turned even paler, but he didn’t dare speak a word and hurriedly left.

Once the young man left, the middle aged man gazed at Yang Ye, “How about we spar a little?”

Clamorous noise instantly resounded. Everyone gazed at Yang Ye with disbelief. Who is he to actually make our sect master challenge him? Does he even have the ability?

Yang Ye remained silent. Meanwhile, the middle aged man added, “An Nanjing is a member of my Martial Sect, and I’d really like to see how good her judgment is. Of course, I’m also very curious about how strong the number one genius of the lower dimensions is!”

“The number one genius of the lower dimensions?” Yang Ye was astounded, “Me?”

The middle aged man smiled, “You don’t know? You’re the number one genius of the lower dimensions now. Actually, it isn’t exaggerated to call you the number one expert of the lower dimensions.”

Everyone here was stunned when they heard the middle aged man!

The number one genius of the lower dimensions? The number one expert of the lower dimensions?

That fellow, Yang Ye?

If someone else spoke those words, they would definitely not believe it, and they would even spit in that person’s face. However, it was their sect master!

“I dare not accept those titles!” Yang Ye spoke humbly, “There’s always someone stronger.”

The middle aged man smiled, “No matter what, let’s spar!”

Yang Ye replied, “Can I refuse?”

The middle aged man was puzzled, “Why?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “You’re very strong, so it’s very difficult to defeat you without using my true strength. But if I do that, you’ll definitely die.”

Yang Ye felt that the middle aged man was very strong! But no matter how strong the middle aged man was, he wouldn’t be able to resist Yang Ye’s Rebirth Sword!

The disciples of the Martial Sect were furious when they heard Yang Ye, and they glared angrily at them. If it wasn’t for the middle aged man’s presence, they would have charged forward and attacked him!

The middle aged man fell silent for a moment, and then he said, “Let’s not decide on a victor and just purely exchange a single blow. Alright?”

Yang Ye smiled, “That’s fine!”

The middle aged man nodded and took a step forward. A moment later, he clenched his right fist and swung it forward!

The space around the fist cracked apart, and then an energy fist shot forward and transformed into a ray of light that slammed towards Yang Ye.

Quasi Returnal Rank fist intent! RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly. He knew the middle aged man was very strong, but he didn’t expect that the middle aged man had comprehended Quasi Returnal Rank fist intent!

Yang Ye didn’t dare act carelessly. The ancient sheath appeared in his grasp with a flip of his palm, and then he drew his sword and swung it.

Three overlapped Heavenrends!

A beam of sword energy flashed forward and collided with the energy fist.

Boom!

The energy fist shattered into bits, and then the sword energy continued forward in the middle aged man’s direction.

The middle aged man slammed his fist forward again!

Bang!

An explosion resounded, and then the middle aged man was pushed around 3km back!

He’d lost!

At this moment, the surroundings were perfectly silent!
