Chapter 2708 – Fuck You!

Yang Ye and Snowy arrived at an unknown place.

The starry sky was like a huge black hole, boundless yet captivating.

Yang Ye gazed at the starry sky before him and was quite puzzled.

Upon arriving here, a strand of mysterious force had obstructed him and stopped him from going forward.Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Yang Ye glanced at Great Unknown, and then he activated it again. However, it was no use. The space before him was like an invisible door and obstructed his path.

The Destiny Dimension refused him entrance!

Yang Ye finally figured it out!

This Destiny Dimension he’d arrived at didn’t belong to Tu, it belonged to the strongest form of Destiny!

However, he hadn’t expected Great Unknown to actually bring him here!

After a moment of silence, Yang Ye gazed at Snowy. She blinked, and then gazed at the area ahead. Snowy hesitated before waving her paws, and then spirit energy started to converge there.

A formation!

The Destiny Dimension clearly had a barrier and formation around it, and Yang Ye wanted Snowy to break open the barrier and formation!

Formations and barriers were nothing before Snowy!

Just like that, Snowy practically took away all the spirit energy in the area.

Yang Ye Gazed at Great Unknown and shook it slightly, and then he vanished on the spot with Snowy.

A short while later, they appeared in a brand new world.

It was very small, a little unusually small.

There was only a single mountain in the entire world, a mountain that towered up far beyond Yang Ye’s vision.

It stood at the center of this world!

Snowy looked up, and then she gazed at Yang Ye and pointed at the mountain.

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings and didn’t sense any signs of life!

He hesitated for a moment and flew up into the air with Snowy.

They were headed for the top of the mountain!

However, as soon as they rose up into the air, a wave of invisible energy descended from the sky and suppressed Yang Ye back to the ground!

Snowy blinked with a curious expression on her face!

The energy hadn’t affected Snowy at all!

But Yang Ye had been severely affected, and his body had almost collapsed just now!

What the heck?

Yang Ye looked up at the mountain, and he knew that it had some secrets!

Yang Ye used his profound energy to swiftly repair his body. Around an hour later, Yang Ye had recovered completely, and he brought Snowy to the foot of the mountain. There was a stone stairway that led to the top, but it was quite strange. It was made of an unknown rock, and when Yang Ye looked at it from up close, he noticed that it wasn’t really rocks but scales!

Like dragon scales!

Yang Ye looked along the stairs yet couldn’t see the end of it. It was like a dragon that curled all the way up, and it was a rather magnificent sight.

Yang Ye thought for a moment and started ascending the stairs.

Since he was here, he naturally planned to go up and have a look. Yang Ye was quite curious about the strongest form of Destiny.

Yang Ye climbed incessantly with Snowy in his arms. He was walking swiftly to the point it seemed like he was flying.

However, as he traveled up, he realized that the mountain seemed like it was without end, and he couldn’t see its peak at all!

Yang Ye continued!

Just like that, he walked for almost a day!

However, he hadn’t even gone up halfway.

Snowy had fallen asleep on Yang Ye’s shoulder.

This journey of theirs was truly boring!

She’d wanted to fly up there on many occasions, but Yang Ye refused to allow it because he didn’t know what would be waiting for her up there!

Just like that, Yang Ye continued ascending the mountain.

Three days later, Yang Ye stopped because he noticed that he was actually quite tired!

He was quite tired!

His legs felt heavy like they were pumped full of lead!

Yang Ye was quite shocked. He was a peak Destiny Realm expert, so how could he get tired?

Yang Ye looked up, yet all he could see was clouds. So, he continued forward. This time, he traveled even faster and was practically shooting forward!

Five days later, Yang Ye slowed down.

Seven days later, he was as slow as an old man, and he was on the verge of being unable to walk further!

Yang Ye looked up. At this moment, the top of the mountain seemed quite blurry to him, and it was quite far away. However, he was almost there!

But he was really out of strength!

Yang Ye rested against the mountain wall in silence, and a long time passed before he continued forward.

Unyielding!

In the beginning, he’d just been curious about what was at the top, but now, all he wanted was to get to the top.

The unyielding spirit in his bones!

Just like that, Yang Ye walked for around ten more days.

Now, he was practically crawling.

Tired!

He was truly tired, more tired than he ever was from fighting.

He could give up, he could have given up many times. It was very difficult to go up, but he knew that going down would be very easy. If he traveled down, it would take no more than two days to reach the bottom.

But he didn’t want to give up!

Sometimes, there were some things that could never be put back.

He didn’t want to let himself give up. Once he did that, he may always choose to give up in the face of difficulties!

Of course, he didn’t think too much about it. He just didn’t want to give up on anything. At the very least, he had to give it his all, and it would be an entirely different thing if he really couldn’t. He was no pedantic person!

Just like that, three more days passed, and Yang Ye finally reached the top.

“Hehe!” Suddenly, a chuckle resounded in Yang Ye’s ear.

Yang Ye looked up, and he saw an ethereal woman. She wore a dark green dress with hair that hung down to her shoulders, and she held a dark green fan. There was a Go board before her, and there was a dark green sword by the board.

Pure dark green!

At this moment, the woman was looking at him with a grin on her face.

Meanwhile, Snowy appeared on Yang Ye’s shoulder. She glanced at the woman and was quite vigilant.

The woman glanced at Snowy and smiled, “Tsk, tsk. Good Sprite, I didn’t expect you to become like that. Haha…”

Snowy blinked, glanced at the sword by the board, and then pointed at the sword. She was asking if she could play with it!

Yang Ye was absolutely speechless.

The woman glanced at the sword and smiled, “You want to play with it?”

Snowy nodded.

She chuckled and tapped a finger at Snowy, causing the sword to fly over to Snowy.

The sword was a gorgeous dark green, and it was simply elegant and devoid of any desire to kill. It didn’t seem like a sword at all.

Snowy glanced at the sword, and then she withdrew Past Life and Great Unknown. She glanced at the three swords and unconsciously attempted to merge them. However, the dark green sword suddenly shook, and then Past Life and Great Unknown shook violently. They struggled free of Snowy’s grasp and flew back into the Primordial Pagoda.

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly from the sight of this.

The dark green sword had actually been able to deter the others!

Snowy was stunned for a moment, and then she gazed at the dark green sword and knocked it lightly with her paw. She was telling it to be obedient…

Suddenly, the dark green sword struggled free of Snowy’s grasp and returned to the woman.

Snowy blinked. She glanced at the dark green sword and gazed at the woman, and the latter smiled, “You almost destroyed its sprite, so it doesn’t have a very good impression of you.”

Snowy glanced at the sword, and then grunted lightly before returning to Yang Ye’s side.

If it refused to let her touch it, then she didn’t want to touch it either!

Yang Ye rubbed Snowy’s head and gazed at the woman, the latter smiled, “Are you still going to lay there?”

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment, and then he dragged up his heavy body and sat before the woman.

She smiled, “I don’t have to introduce myself, right?”

Yang Ye shook his head.

She sized up Yang Ye and smiled, “I’m very busy, and I have too much to do. So, I won’t waste time on saying unnecessary things, and don’t ask me about them either. If you should know about it, you will; and if you shouldn’t, it’s pointless for you to know.”

Yang Ye nodded, “You first!”

She turned around and walked to the side while her beautiful hair fluttered before the mountain winds.

There was a faint fragrance coming from her.

She looked up into the distance, “They chose you, but I don’t think you’re qualified.”

Yang Ye gazed at her, “Why?”

She smiled, “Your vision is too narrow, and the emotions in your Sword Dao are too narrow as well, and the way you think is absolutely narrow. As far as I’m concerned, you’re just a rash fellow, and hot-blooded, selfish, and rash fellow.”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

She gazed into the distance. Actually, her gaze could see very, very far away, “However, since they chose you, I should give them some face.”

She turned around to look at Yang Ye, and she smiled, “Convince me. I’ll kill you if you don’t!”

Yang Ye fell silent for a short while and asked, “Why?”

She shook her head, “As I said, convince me. Don’t talk about giving up or not giving up, you can’t choose to give up now. If you do, I’ll still kill you. Moreover, I’ll kill Qi Bitian, the Good Sprite, the Evil Beast, and all the others. They may seem innocent now, but the world may be destroyed at their hands in the future. Of course, if you convince me, all of that won’t happen. Moreover, you’ll benefit too.”

Her intentions were clear. If Yang Ye won her acknowledgement, everyone by his side could live and become part of his forces; but if he failed, he would die, and so would the people by his side!

It was like an emperor choosing the crown prince. A prince who wasn’t chosen to be the crown prince couldn’t have too many forces by his side. After all, they would pose a threat to the crown prince.

Yang Ye gazed at her. She had a smile on her face, a very sincere smile. But Yang Ye knew that she wasn’t joking.

He fell silent for a moment, and then he suddenly drew his sword and swung it.

Bang!

The Go board was slashed into bits!

Yang Ye pointed his sword at her and spoke angrily, “Fuck you! If you want to kill me, then do it! Don’t spout all that nonsense at me!
