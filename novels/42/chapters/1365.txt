Chapter 1366 – 10 Moves?

Besides Ye Liuyun, the eyes of everyone were filled with shock.

A Voider had been killed with a single swing of the sword!

An Emperor had killed a Voider!

Moreover, I had been done with such ease!

At this moment, Yue Tingyu was extremely shocked. Because she knew that she’d severely underestimated Yang Ye’s strength. Besides shock, she felt a trace of terror as well. After all, the merchant group had lost a Voider because of her. What did that represent? It represented that her future was over even if Yang Ye was killed.

Because it was a taboo for merchant groups to cause losses due to private issues!

A single decision had destroyed her future!

Meanwhile, Elder Xun who stood by Yue Tingyu’s side asked in a low voice, “May I know your rank on the Dragon Rankings?”

Yue Tingyu’s face instantly changed upon hearing this.

The Dragon Rankings!

All the geniuses on that ranking were beyond terrifying. It wasn’t a ranking within a single world; it was a ranking within the entire universe. There were over a hundred stellar regions and thousands of worlds in the universe, and so long as one possessed sufficient strength, one could be ranked on that ranking regardless of which world one came from!

It could be considered the most authoritative ranking outside the large world. Because every single expert ranked on the Dragon Rankings was the top monstrous genius of their respective stellar regions!

Yue Tingyu’s delicate figure had started to tremble slightly. If Yang Ye was really ranked on the Dragon Rankings, then even if he was right at the back, she would still be finished.

Merchants pursued profits and benefits. Azure Cloud Merchant Group would absolutely not offend a genius on the Dragon Rankings for her sake. So, if Yang Ye really was ranked on the Dragon Rankings, then the merchant group would definitely sacrifice her to resolve the conflict between Yang Ye and the merchant group.

“The Dragon Rankings?” Yang Ye stopped and frowned, “What’s that?”

Yue Tingyu instantly heaved a sigh of relief when she heard him, and then she ridiculed, “Dark Hell Continent is such a poor and barren continent. How could such an expert....”

“Shut your mouth!” Suddenly, a soft shout resounded.

Everyone looked over and saw a woman and a man walking slowly in their direction. Yang Ye was slightly stunned when he saw the woman. Because she wasn’t dressed like a girl but was dressed like a man instead. She wore a violet robe that was embroidered with fiery phoenixes and a maroon belt was wrapped tightly around her waist, causing her figure to seem extremely elegant.

She had a peerlessly beautiful oval shaped face, a small and elegant nose, gorgeous eyebrows that were sharp like swords, and emanated a heroic aura. Her lips seemed very thin yet didn’t feel thin at all, and there was a faint smile hanging on the corners of her mouth. But if one looked carefully, that smile didn’t seem to exist as well.

Her beautiful hair was tied behind her with a violet ribbon. It wasn’t long nor short, and it just reached her waist.

The man by her side wore a bright white robe, had a handsome appearance and a sharp gaze, and his entire body emanated a trace of a faint dignified aura. It wasn’t emanated intentionally, and it was something that he possessed naturally.

Yue Tingyu’s expression changed slightly at the sight of the woman. She hurriedly walked over and bowed respectfully, “Second Young Miss.”

The woman paid no attention to Yue Tingyu and just walked straight towards Yang Ye.

Yue Tingyu’s face instantly became unsightly.

The woman arrived before Yang Ye and said, “Sorry.”

Yang Ye was quite stunned. He’d thought that the woman was here to look for trouble with him. After all, he was used to seeing the seniors appear upon beating up the young. But he hadn’t expected the woman to actually apologize upon arriving here.

It was quite unusual! Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Meanwhile, the woman continued, “I completed my investigation before coming. That item belonging to Skyriver Stellar Region was auctioned off by us. However, it was in their possession, so their loss has nothing to do with our merchant group. As for our manager coming to look for trouble with you and acting on behalf of Skyriver Stellar Region, that was her own actions and has nothing to do with my Azure Cloud Merchant Group!”

As soon as she finished speaking, she turned to look at Yue Tingyu and continued, “Yue Tingyu, not only have you lost face for our merchant group, you even caused our merchant group to lose an expert. Such a crime is unforgivable. But out of consideration for the meritorious service you’ve rendered, you can avoid death. However, you can’t avoid punishment. Elder Xun, cripple her cultivation!”

Yue Tingyu’s face instantly turned ghastly pale upon hearing this.

Thump!

Yue Tingyu immediately knelt before the woman and kowtowed incessantly, “Second Young Miss, I’ve never made any mistakes throughout the years. I really don’t deserve such a heavy punishment for this mistake. Please be merciful, Second Young Miss.”

She kowtowed without end even after she finished speaking.

Even though she wasn’t killing Yue Tingyu, crippling Yue Tingyu’s cultivation was no different than a death sentence. After all, it was obvious what sort of fate she would suffer in this world where only the strong were respected.

Elder Xun seemed to be unable to bear the sight of this, and he was about to speak out and beg for mercy on Yue Tingyu’s behalf. However, the woman suddenly said, “Elder Xun, I know what you’re thinking. But you must realize that our merchant group is huge, and we have many managers. If an example isn’t made out of her, then if everyone learns from her and uses the merchant group to resolve their private enmity, it will cause tremendous problems for the merchant group in the long term.”

Elder Xun sighed softly and said, “Second Young Miss, I understand. However, I’m sure you’re aware that the merchant group gave its managers the authority to make us help them. This....”

The woman waved her hand and interrupted Elder Xun, “If it was only that, then she would naturally not deserve such punishment. However....” She gazed at Yue Tingyu and continued, “Yue Tingyu, is this really your only crime?”

Yue Tingyu’s delicate figure trembled. A long time passed before she said, “Second Young Miss, you know everything.”

The woman shook her head and said, “Greed is an original sin!” She turned to look at Elder Xun and continued, “Do you want me to do it myself?”

Elder Xun sighed softly and walked to Yue Tingyu. He was just about to act when a voice suddenly came from afar, “Wait!”

Everyone looked towards the source of the voice, and they saw a beautiful woman and an old man walking over in their direction. The beautiful woman was around 70% similar in appearance to the previous woman addressed as Second Young Miss. However, her bearing was completely different. The beautiful woman had a curvaceous and enchanting figure, and there was a faint smile that was slightly seductive on her face.

Elder Xun and the others quickly bowed, “Eldest Young Miss!”

The beautiful woman walked over to the other woman and smiled, “Sister, if news were to spread that you crippled your subordinate for an outsider, then it would make all the other managers feel bitterly disappointed!”

The Second Young Miss spoke indifferently, “Then how do you think this matter should be dealt with?”

The beautiful woman smiled, “I know what that little girl did. She was quite greedy. However, she has done hard work for us throughout these years, so crippling her cultivation really is too heavy. How about you just remove her from her position? Otherwise, if you make a little girl like her lose her strength, it’s better to just kill her and allow her to avoid even more suffering!”

“Thank you, Eldest Young Miss!” Meanwhile, Yue Tingyu stood up and knelt before the beautiful woman, “Tingyu will never forget Elder Young Miss’s kindness!”

When she witnessed this scene, Ye Liuyun shook her head and called Yue Tingyu a fool in her mind. Acting like that was clearly like slapping Yue Tingyu’s second young miss’s face. If Ye Liuyun was in that position, she would absolutely not allow Yue Tingyu to live. Conversely, if Yue Tingyu refused the eldest young miss and was willing to suffer the second young miss’s punishment, then not only would she be able to keep her cultivation, she would be put in an important position!

Unfortunately, she hadn’t done that!

Sure enough, a ray of cold light flashed.

Hiss!

Yue Tingyu’s figure stiffened on the spot. It didn’t take long for a drop of blood to seep out from the center of her forehead, and then she fell lifelessly to the ground. Her eyes were opened wide at the moment of her death.

She’d died with everlasting regret.

The expressions of the others here changed. All of them gazed at the second young miss because she was the one who’d launched the attack.

The second young miss of Azure Cloud Merchant Group spoke indifferently, “Since you said that I should just kill her, then it’s best to just kill her.”

The smile on the beautiful woman’s face vanished, but it didn’t take long for her to return to normal, “Sister, you’re truly ruthless.”

The second young miss of Azure Cloud Merchant Group paid no attention to the beautiful woman and turned to look at Yang Ye instead, “You killed a member of my merchant group. I can’t just forget that. However, I won’t bully you. Withstand 10 moves from Elder Xun. I’ll let bygones be bygones if you can.”

It’s finally here! Yang Ye knew that it would definitely not be so easy to resolve the matter. Sure enough, she’d come looking for trouble with him.

Yang Ye glanced at her and smiled, “10 moves? Second Young Miss, he’s a true Voider, but what about me? I’m just an Emperor. Yet you ask me to withstand 10 moves from him. Tell me the truth, are you trying to kill me?”

She looked Yang Ye in the eyes and said, “Yes, or no?”

He smiled, “Second Young Miss, you said that you wouldn’t bully me, but aren’t you doing that right now?”

She replied, “Are you refusing?”

“No, of course we accept!” It wasn’t Yang Ye but Ye Liuyun who said that. Ye Liuyun walked over to Yang Ye’s side and smiled, “But let’s change the terms. Make him withstand 10 moves from us instead!”

Everyone here was stunned upon hearing Ye Liuyun, and it included Yang Ye himself. However, he didn’t stop her. Since he’d chosen her, he fully trusted her.

The second young miss of Azure Cloud Merchant Group gazed at Ye Liuyun and said, “Are my ears deceiving me?”

“Of course not!” Ye Liuyun smiled, “We’re confident.”

The second young miss of Azure Cloud Merchant Group turned to look at Yang Ye. Yang Ye shrugged and said, “I’ll do as she said. Since she said I should, then I will.”

The second young miss of Azure Cloud Merchant Group nodded, “Then let’s begin.”

Meanwhile, Ye Liuyun walked over to her and said, “Second Young Miss, how about we make a bet?”

The second young miss of Azure Cloud Merchant Group glanced at Ye Liuyun and asked, “What sort of bet?”

Ye Liuyun smiled, “I bet that old man won’t be able to withstand 10 moves from my Young Master.”

The second young miss of Azure Cloud Merchant Group gazed at Ye Liuyun for a long time before she said, “What’s the wager?”

Ye Liuyun replied with a smile on her face, “100,000 divine crystals!

Yang Ye was stunned when he heard this.

100,000 divine crystals?

We only have 30,000 divine crystals if the resources we possess are combined. Where are we going to get 100,000? What’s she trying to do?

There was a slight change in the second young miss’s expression when she heard Ye Liuyun, “May I know your name?”

Ye Liuyun answered, “Ye Liuyun!”

The second young miss nodded, “A bet isn’t a problem. But Miss Ye, do you have 100,000 divine crystals?”

Ye Liuyun smiled, “You should have investigated us. Even though Dark Hell Continent is just a poor continent, we can still produce 100,000 divine crystals.”

The second young miss gazed at Ye Liuyun for a long time before she nodded, “Alright, I’ll take the bet.”

Ye Liuyun smiled, and then she walked over to Yang Ye, “100,000 divine crystals are equivalent to 10 million violet crystals. If you lose, our entire Sword Alliance will have to eat grass with you. So do as you see fit!”

Do as I see fit?

100,000 divine crystals?

Yang Ye took a deep breath, and then the ancient sheath appeared in his left grasp. After that, a ray of light flashed before the Sword Spirit transformed into the Sword Precursor and appeared in his right grasp.

Yang Ye sheathed it and looked up at Elder Xun, “Come!”
