Chapter 2155 – Are All Humans So Weak?

At this moment, Yang Ye was quite shocked. He was certain that Snowy and him didn’t know the black robed figure, but Snowy was so close to the black robed figure. This represented that Snowy didn’t think the black robed figure was dangerous!

The black robed figure glanced at Yang Ye and replied to Snowy, “He can’t help.”

Snowy blinked and pointed at Yang Ye. She was saying that Yang Ye was very strong!

Yang Ye felt speechless.

The black robed figure shook their head and rubbed Snowy’s head gently, “Take care. I’ll come see you when I’m free!”

The black robed figure glanced at Yang Ye and continued, “Take good care of her!”

The black robed figure vanished upon saying those words.

Once the black robed figure left, Yang Ye took Snowy in his arms and asked, “You know that person?”

Snowy shook her head and started waving her claws.

Yang Ye fell silent.

Snowy was saying that person was just like her!

Snowy’s own kind!

Yang Ye looked up at the sky. At this moment, he’d guessed the black robed figure’s identity.

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts, shook his head, and then gazed at Snowy, “Let’s go!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he vanished into the sky with Snowy in his arms.

Yang Ye arrived before the endless black holes again. As far as he was concerned, regardless of whether it was the Star Gates or the teleportation formations left behind by the Initial Civilization, he needed to look for them. The reason was very simple. Once they really had no way out, then those organizations in the large universe and the attention of those experts would move to Snowy.

If they attacked, Yang Ye would really be unable to stop them!

After he obtained that information from the prehistoric expert, Yang Ye’s heart felt quite heavy. The current situation in the large universe was worrying indeed. If the End Times arrived, it would clearly be impossible for him to stay out of everything and just care about himself.

When the End Times arrive, he would be the center of the vortex in the large universe, and all the organizations here would be revolving around him!

He had quite the headache!

When Yang Ye arrived before the endless black holes again, the Dao Progenitor appeared before him. The Dao Progenitor sized up Yang Ye and asked, “The spirit of that black hole left with you?”

Yang Ye nodded.

The Dao Progenitor smiled, “Can I have a look at it?”

Yang Ye naturally wouldn’t refuse, so he summoned it outside. The latter was clearly quite afraid when it saw the Dao Progenitor, and it didn’t dare go forward. It hid behind Snowy instead.

The Dao Progenitor gazed at it for a long time and said, “It really is a Black Hole Spirit!”

Yang Ye asked, “What is it?”

The Dao Progenitor shook his head slightly, “I met one in the past. It was much stronger than this one, and I found out some things from it. Since you’ve gone to the prehistoric ruins, I presume you know some things too.”

Yang Ye nodded.

The Dao Progenitor said, “The Star Gate and the teleportation formations left behind by the Initial Civilization. It’s what we must find. Even if we only find one of them, it’s still alright. Only by finding one of them will the attention of everyone in the large universe move away from you and your Sprite Lord. Otherwise, once the End Times arrive, many people will go mad in such a hopeless situation. Even the people closest to you may act against you.”

Yang Ye suddenly gazed at the Dao Progenitor and asked, “Senior, what about you?”

“Me?” The Dao Progenitor grinned, “Little fellow, you think too little of me.”

As he spoke, he looked up at the ends of space, “Even if the universe is destroyed, I won’t die. Unless existences at my level want to die, it’s very difficult for others to kill us. Just like the Confucianist Progenitor. If he didn’t want to die, no one could kill him!”

Yang Ye Hesitated for a moment and asked, “Is the Dao Path linked to the Confucianist Progenitor’s death?”

The Dao Progenitor shook his head slightly, “No. Of course, it is slightly linked to us. If the other three paths didn’t stand by idly, then the Confucianist Path wouldn’t have fallen to its current state.”

He gazed at Yang Ye and continued, “As far as I’m concerned, many things aren’t that important. What’s important is that my sect lives on.”

“I see!” Yang Ye nodded, “I’ll try my best to find the Star Gate and the teleportation formations. If I really can’t find it…”

“You must!” The Dao Progenitor spoke abruptly, “You may die if you fail!”

Yang Ye frowned when he heard this.

The Dao Progenitor explained, “It isn’t just the Alliance of All that’s targeting you, there are two other mysterious organizations. They haven’t acted against you yet because the price to do so is too high right now. They aren’t willing to pay such a price right now. However, once the End Times arrive, they will stop at nothing to take your Sprite Lord. This includes the god race too. Simply speaking, if you can’t find another way to survive the End Times, the entire large universe will become your enemy. Unless you’re willing to give up that Sprite Lord!”

.

Give up Snowy? Yang Ye shook his head. He would never give her away!

As if he knew what Yang Ye was thinking, the Dao Progenitor smiled, “No matter what, just try your best. As for the outcome, it sometimes depends on destiny!” He vanished on the spot once he finished speaking.

Yang Ye stood silently on the spot for a long time, and then he turned around and left.

Yang Ye had planned to just casually choose one of the black holes, but after giving it some thought, he didn’t do that. He summoned Snowy and the Black Hole Spirit instead.

Snowy gazed at Yang Ye and kept blinking. She seemed really cute and obedient.

Yang Ye thought for a moment and said, “Help me see which of these black holes has… Hmm, has treasures! See which of them has treasures!”

Treasures!

Snowy blinked, and then she gazed at the Black Hole Spirit. The latter was quite stunned, and it took quite some time for Snowy to explain what treasures were to it!

Yang Ye and Snowy watched as the little black ball trembled, and then Snowy’s eyes lit up.

Yang Ye was delighted when he saw this. He knew that it worked!

Meanwhile, the Black Hole Spirit floated off into the distance. Snowy hurriedly gazed at Yang Ye and pointed at the little black ball. Obviously, she was telling him to follow it.

Yang Ye nodded, and then he took Snowy in his arms and followed after it. The little black ball led Yang Ye and Snowy through countless black holes. Actually, it was quite dangerous because one had no sense of direction within the black holes. So, the slightest mistake may cause one to get lost within the black hole.

If Yang Ye was alone, he would absolutely not travel through them like this.

The reason he dared to do it now was mainly because he had the Black Hole Spirit, and he wouldn’t get lost while he had it to lead the way.

Just like that, Yang Ye followed the Black Hole Spirit through countless black holes. Finally, it stopped, and then floated over to Yang Ye and Snowy. Snowy nodded, and then she gazed at Yang Ye and pointed ahead.

Yang Ye looked up, and there was a black palace around 3km away from them.

A palace!

Yang Ye gazed at Snowy and asked, “There’s treasures in there?” The latter gazed at the black ball.

Yang Ye was stunned speechless.

In the end, Yang Ye took Snowy in his arms and walked over to the palace, and the black ball followed behind Yang Ye. It didn’t take long for them to arrive before it, there were two large words on top of it. However, Yang Ye didn’t recognize those words.

Yang Ye gazed at Snowy, and the latter cracked a smile. Yang Ye rubbed her head and said, “Go inside first!”

Snowy puckered her lips and unwillingly entered the Primordial Pagoda.

Yang Ye gazed at the little black ball, “You go inside too!”

The latter wasn’t unwilling and decisively entered the Primordial pagoda. However, it was extremely careful within the pagoda now. Presently, it knew that there were two it couldn’t afford to offend in the Primordial Pagoda. One was Snowy, and the other was the pagoda’s spirit. It would definitely suffer if it offended the two of them.

Yang Ye pushed open the palace’s door and walked in. It was completely empty. Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings, and he saw some strange paintings on the walls. They were of shapes that were impossible to describe and extremely strange.

What is this place? Yang Ye frowned. Suddenly, a huge circle of light appeared not too far away from Yang Ye. Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly, and a sword appeared in his grasp.

It was best to be careful at a place like this!

Yang Ye watched as the circle of light gradually formed a vague figure. It was very vague and impossible to see clearly.

“It has been countless years!” Meanwhile, the voice resounded in the hall, “You’re the first living being to get here!”

Living being!

Yang Ye had quite a weird expression on his face. He hesitated for a moment and said, “I’m human!”

“Human?” There was slight surprise in the voice, “A new species?”

Yang Ye felt speechless.

The voice asked, “What is the current era?”

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and asked, “Senior, which era are you from?” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

The voice replied, “My era was born along with this universe.”

The Initial Civilization!

Yang Ye glanced at the figure. Actually, he’d guessed the answer to his question. He thought for a moment and said, “After your era, was the prehistoric race. After the prehistoric race was the void spirit race. After the void spirit race was the god race and the current era of many races. That’s where we are right now.”

“I see!” The voice continued, “Are all humans so weak like you?”

Yang Ye was stunned speechless.
