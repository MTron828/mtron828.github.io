Chapter 2185 – Exhausted!

Exhausted!

An Nanjing was tired.

She was truly, truly tired!

Since the battle began, she was the most tired of them all. Now, she really couldn’t go on any longer.

Right when An Nanjing’s eyes were about to close completely, a pair of hands suddenly held her face. She used all her strength to open her eyes, and she saw Yang Ye before her.

At this moment, Yang Ye was completely crimson red, and his eyes were no more.

Her heart hurt when she saw him like this.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly said, “Stay by my side.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he transported her into the Primordial Pagoda.

Once she entered the pagoda, the Primordial Pagoda immediately started sending countless strands of Primordial Violet Energy into her while Snowy ceaselessly sent torrents of spirit energy to her.

However, An Nanjing’s aura was still growing weaker and weaker.

Snowy was so anxious she couldn’t stop crying.

Suddenly, Tian Xiu squatted by An Nanjing’s side. An Nanjing gazed at her, “I’m afraid I really won’t be able to hold on. H-Help him in the future, alright?”

Tian Xiu gazed at her in silence.

An Nanjing spoke softly, “He’s… a good person!”

A good person!

Was Yang Ye a good person?

It depended on the individual person. As far as An Nanjing was concerned, Yang Ye was a good person. When a million arrows were raining down upon her, it was Yang Ye who’d used his body to stop them for her. Since that moment, the image of a person was etched in her heart.

She was willing to fight the entire world for him!

An Nanjing’s eyes started to close slowly. Suddenly, Tian Xiu grabbed her hand. In an instant, a strand of boundless mysterious energy surged into An Nanjing.

Voice Spirit Energy!

The Dao Progenitor had told Yang Ye that when the universe was born, there had been three types of energy. Primordial Violet Energy, Natural Energy, and Chaos Energy. Actually, there was one more.

Void Spirit Energy!

Void Spirit Energy was superior to all three energies, and it was eternal and indestructible!

However, An Nanjing’s eyes still closed in the end.

Snowy was stunned, and then she started crying more.

Meanwhile, Tian Xiu rubbed Snowy’s little head, “She’s just sleeping.”

Sleeping!

Snowy gazed at Tian Xiu, and then Tian Xiu nodded to guarantee it.

However, Snowy was still crying. She started waving her claws and was asking if she was really useless.

Tian Xiu rubbed Snowy’s head, “Don’t think too much about it. Big Brother will be fine. Don’t do anything stupid too, alright?”

Don’t do anything stupid!

Snowy’s thoughts were very pure and simple. She felt that if she left with the Spirit God’s group, then they would spare Yang Ye, and she was prepared to do that. Tian Xiu had realized that, and that was why she’d said that.

The conflict between Yang Ye and the Alliance of All was the Sprite Lord, but it was just the Sprite Lord anymore.

They would never let Yang Ye live.

He was a threat!

He was a true threat to them!

As for Snowy… To be a little frank, the world within the Primordial Pagoda would be dead without Snowy in it.

No matter how monstrous the Primordial Pagoda was, it couldn’t create spirit energy on its own. The reason the Primordial Pagoda loved Snowy so much was mainly because it would have an endless supply of Spirit Energy while Snowy was here.

Snowy was the most useful, and she just couldn’t fight!

Tian Xiu consoled Snowy, and then she looked up. Her gaze was extremely icy cold. But it only took a moment for bewilderment to fill her eyes, but then it turned icy cold again. Just like that, her gaze kept changing.

Outside the Primordial Pagoda.

Everyone here had stopped, and they were looking at Yang Ye.

At this moment, there was no slaughter intent or blood around Yang Ye. However, he seemed like he was made of blood itself. At this moment, he felt dangerous to them just by standing there!

Extremely dangerous!

“Retreat!” Suddenly, a voice resounded in the Spirit God’s mind.

It was the Weapon Progenitor’s voice!

Retreat?

The Spirit God looked up at the sky, “Why?”

A short while passed before an extremely unsightly expression appeared on his face.

It wasn’t that the five progenitors refused to help, they couldn’t.

They were heavily injured.

The five progenitors had attacked Yang Wudi together, but they hadn’t just suffered light injuries from the battle, they’d been severely injured. Or to be more precise, Yang Wudi had almost taken all of them with him. Even they had never expected that jointly attacking Yang Wudi would end in such a way!

Yang Wudi’s strength far surpassed their expectations!

Besides that, they’d never expected people to come help Yang Ye while he was in such a situation, and they were shocked to witness Yang Ye actually attain the Progenitor Realm in slaughter intent at this moment!

Retreat! ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

The progenitors decisively decided to retreat!

The Spirit God glanced at the surroundings. No more than 60 of the Sages on his side remained, and most of them were heavily injured!

They’d suffered severe losses!

Truly severe losses!

The Spirit God took a deep breath and said, “Let’s go!”

As soon as he gave the order, all the Sages intended to leave.

However, Yang Ye suddenly said, “You’re leaving?”

As soon as he finished speaking, a ray of blood red sword energy flashed.

Hiss!

The head of a Sage by the Spirit God’s side flew up into the air!

He hadn’t been able to fight back at all!

The Spirit God was astounded because Yang Ye was actually that strong!

“Attack!” As soon as he gave the order, the Spirit God raised both his hands. In an instant, countless strands of spirit energy converged together. In an instant, strands of spirit energy swept out toward Yang Ye like bolts of lightning.

Suddenly, Yang Ye raised his hand and swung his sword.

Hiss!

The spirit energy was instantly obliterated!

The Spirit God and the other Sages’ expressions instantly turned extremely unsightly from the sight of this. At this moment, Yang Ye’s strength had undergone a qualitative transformation when compared to the past.

Yang Ye’s current strength was much, much stronger than it had been!

The Spirit God and the others had the desire to retreat now. They wanted to avoid him for now, but how could Yang Ye possibly let them retreat?”

Suddenly, Yang Ye raised his right foot and pressed it down lightly.

Hiss!

The space beneath his feet was instantly obliterated, and then a ray of blood red light shot forward. It was extremely swift and instantly entered the group of Sages before him.

In an instant, they were enveloped by monstrous slaughter intent.

At this moment, the Spirit God had a ferocious expression on his face.

He knew that it was impossible to retreat now. Because retreating now would be no different than killing the Sages behind him!

Fight!

The Spirit God waved his hands. In an instant, countless strands of spirit energy converged madly to him, and the Barbaric King and Shaman Emperor beside him acted as well.

At this moment, only the three of them could keep Yang Ye busy, so they had to step forward. Otherwise, the other Sages wouldn’t be able to resist a single attack from Yang Ye!

After he attained the Progenitor Realm in slaughter intent, ordinary Sages were nothing before Yang Ye!

In the past, he had to use his full strength to kill a Sage in an instant, yet now, just a casual swing of his sword could accomplish that!

Yang Ye slaughtered the other Sages while he fought against the Spirit God’s group of three.

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!

A strange scene appeared here on the battlefield. Ray after ray of sword energy flashed incessantly, and every single one of them would make a head fly.

In just less than 15 minutes, Yang Ye had slaughtered nine Sages on his own!

The Spirit God and the others were truly in panic at this point!

Because they were incapable of keeping Yang Ye tied down anymore.

However, they could discern that Yang Ye was almost completely exhausted, and he was just holding on with his last breath. So long as that passed, Yang Ye would die!

“Kill!” The Spirit God suddenly howled with fury. In an instant, a terrifying wave of energy swept out from within him and slammed against Yang Ye. However, Yang Ye raised his hand and destroyed it with a swing of his sword. At the same time, Yang Ye’s sword transformed into a ray of light that shot forward.

Hiss!

The head of a Sage standing over 1km away flew up into the air!

“Exhaust him to death!” Suddenly, the Barbaric King howled with fury, and then a huge hammer slammed down at Yang Ye. The force it carried obliterated the space around Yang Ye, and it pushed Yang Ye backward repeatedly. However, Yang Ye was merely pushed backward. Because a strand of blood red slaughter intent was in front of Yang Ye, and it was blocking off the force of the attack!

That strand of slaughter intent had blocked an attack that carried the Barbaric King’s full strength!

As soon as Yang Ye stopped himself, a few dozen Sages surrounded him. Boundary Maiden and the others were about to lend him a hand, but Yang Ye had already attacked.

Countless sword howls resounded throughout the surroundings, and then countless rays of blood red sword energy surged out from Yang Ye like a storm and rained down upon the Sages around him.

The sword energy was still the same as before, but it was covered in slaughter intent, and it had become extremely terrifying because of that slaughter intent!

Progenitor Realm slaughter intent!

Slaughter intent that had attained the Progenitor Realm by converging the slaughter intent and blood throughout the large universe!

Such slaughter intent wasn’t something an ordinary person could resist.

The Spirit God and the others turned pale when they saw the slaughter intent. Suddenly, a ray of holy light appeared before them, and it completely blocked off Yang Ye’s blood red sword energy.

Meanwhile, another ray of sword energy suddenly struck the holy light.

Boom!

The light exploded apart!

However, a progenitor had appeared before the Spirit God’s group.

It was the Buddhist Progenitor!

However, it wasn’t his main body, and it was just a phantom. At this moment, he didn’t dare to reveal his main body. If he showed himself after being heavily injured by Yang Wudi, then Yang Ye’s current strength combined with some others who were hiding in the shadows would be entirely sufficient to kill him!

The Buddhist Progenitor gazed at Yang Ye, “If you continue, everyone by your side will die.”

Yang Ye closed his eyes slowly. If he continued fighting, what about the others by his side who were still alive? Were they supposed to die along with him?

Yang Ye took a deep breath and swung his sword.

Bang!

The Buddhist Progenitor’s figure was instantly obliterated.

“Fuck off!” Yang Ye glanced coldly at the Spirit God’s group.

They glanced at him and left.

Far away in the distance, the Buddhist Progenitor’s main body pressed his palms together, “God race, you’ve won!”

Meanwhile, once the Spirit God’s group left, a woman in a white dress suddenly appeared near Yang Ye.

It was Ding Shaoyao!

At the same time, around 25 Sages surrounded Nether Maiden and the others!

Ding Shaoyao looked Yang Ye in the eyes, “All of you are completely exhausted, and you have no chance if you resist. Hand over the Sprite Lord, and everyone by your side can live!”

What she meant was that Yang Ye had to die!

Yang Ye was about to speak when Snowy suddenly left the Primordial Pagoda. She gazed at Yang Ye, cracked a smile, and then waved her little paw. After that, she flew over to Ding Shaoyao and placed her claw against her throat.

Let Yang Ye go or she would take her own life!
