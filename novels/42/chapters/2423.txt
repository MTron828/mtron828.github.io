Chapter 2424 – Either My Enemy Dies, Or I Die!

Awakening of the bloodline?

Yang Ye was stunned, and then he vanished on the spot.

The middle aged man and An Nanjing followed after him.

Deep within the cracks, when Yang Ye and the others arrived before Snowy and Erya, the two little fellows were standing motionlessly by each other’s side. As for the white ball of light, it wasn’t there anymore.

Erya and Snowy just gazed at them with an innocent look on their faces.

The middle aged man glanced at the surroundings, shook his head, and smiled, “You little fellow… You took all the World Crystals that were condensed here over countless years… Forget it, those treasures are useless to me, so you can have them.”

Snowy blinked and acted as if she didn’t know what he was saying while frequently sneaking glances at Yang Ye.

Yang Ye was quite embarrassed. It was obvious that Snowy had taken something.

The middle aged man waved his right hand, and then a white ball of light appeared in his grasp. Snowy was stunned by this, and then her eyes opened wide. She’d hid it well, so she wondered why the ball had come outside!

She planned to take it back, but she discarded that thought when Yang Ye glared at her.

The middle aged man glanced at the ball of light and said, “Spirit Source, it’s the Spirit Source of Abyss World. Simply speaking, it’s the source of spirit energy in Abyss World.” He gazed at Snowy and Erya before he continued, “The amount both of you absorbed earlier took practically half of all the spirit energy in the Abyss World.”

The spirit energy of half a world!

Yang Ye frowned slightly, “Senior, will that affect the Abyss World?”

The middle aged man smiled, “It’s not a big deal. This world never had any life. Even if there are, it’s life that comes from the outside world in search of treasures.”

He flicked the ball of light over to the two little fellows, “You can have it.”

Snowy blinked. She didn’t take it but gazed at Yang Ye instead.

Yang Ye glared at her. Snowy cracked a smile at the sight of this and hurriedly put it away.

The middle aged man gazed at Erya. At this moment, she was very calm, and her veins had returned to normal too.

He seemed to have thought of something as he gazed at her, and he gradually frowned.

Erya glanced at him and just silently licked her tanghulu.

A short while later, the middle aged man spoke softly, “Awakening is good too. The earlier you awaken, the stronger you’ll be. However, don’t lose the “humanity” you have right now.”

He gazed at Yang Ye at this point and said, “If you want them to grow quickly, then help them find these sources of a world’s energy. Of course, don’t look for worlds that have countless lives on them. These things can’t be taken rashly because it’s very harmful to a world that loses it. As for places like Abyss World, it’s fine to take it!”

Yang Ye nodded, “I understand!”

Of course he wanted Snowy and Erya to grow quickly. He would never overlook their ability. If they grew, they would be extraordinary.

The middle aged man gazed at An Nanjing and said, “Come with me!”

He turned around and walked away.

An Nanjing glanced at Yang Ye and followed the man.

Meanwhile, the middle aged man stopped and gazed at An Nanjing, “You’re on the path of the Martial Dao, and it contains everything. The Spear Dao is within the Martial Dao too. My Spear Dao is used based on belief. The stronger your belief, the stronger your spear will be. So long as your belief stands, your spear remains invincible.”

He stretched out his hand at this point, and a spear appeared there. He gazed at her and said, “I only attack once with my spear. If my enemy doesn’t die, then I die. The essence of my Spear Dao is belief…”

At this point, he suddenly stabbed it forward.

An Nanjing’s pupils constricted, and she couldn’t help but clench her fists!

She reacted like she was facing a formidable enemy!

It was the strongest spear attack she’d ever seen in her lifetime. It was very ordinary and didn’t even glow, nor did it emanate any spear intent. However, it was exactly such an attack that aroused despair within her!

She couldn’t stop it!

That was what she thought in the beginning!

But a moment later, she knew she had to even if she couldn’t!

Being no match for the enemy was one thing, but not fighting back was a completely different thing!

An Nanjing counterattacked… The middle aged man smiled when he saw her attack.

Because of An Nanjing, Yang Ye temporarily stayed in the Abyss World, and he seized this opportunity to cultivate like a madman.

However, he didn’t know that many were searching for him right now.Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Eternal Border. World Mountain.

On the teleportation formation, a young man in white clothes suddenly appeared there. He seemed very weak and pale, and it was like a gust of wind could blow him away.

The young man held a white staff in his grasp, and there was a dragon head on its top. A pure white dragon head.

The young man walked off the teleportation platform, glanced at the surroundings, and closed his eyes slowly, “Not here yet?”

As soon as he said that, an old man suddenly appeared before him, and the old man bowed slightly, “Ninth Prince.”

The young man spoke indifferently, “Did my brothers not act against the Sprite Progenitor?”

The old man shook his head, “Prince Huang Ye didn’t go in search of Yang Ye, and he has gone to recruit experts throughout Eternal Border. He had 3 Four World Realm experts and around 6 more peak Three World Realm experts. As for Prince Huang Tianxing, I don’t know how many Four World Realm experts he has, but he has a Three World Realm expert—the Ye Clan’s Ye Gou—, and a Four World Realm ferocious beast.”

The young man grinned, “These two elder brothers of mine aren’t ordinary. While the Sprite Progenitor is great, it’s a hot potato. Anyone who touches it will get burnt. They refuse to touch it and are recruiting experts instead. Amazing!”

The old man lowered his head slightly, “Ninth Prince, what do you plan to do?”

“What do I plan?” The man looked up at the sky, “If they refuse to touch it, I will. Let me see if it can burn off my hand.”

The old man hesitated for a moment and said, “Ninth Prince, that’s…”

The young man smiled, “It’s fine! Let’s go!”

He vanished on the spot once he finished speaking.

The old man hesitated for a moment and followed after him.

At the end of the Eternal River.

A white wall of light stood here, and there were three corpses before it. The corpses hadn’t decayed, and they were looking ahead at the wall of light.

It was the wall between universes.

This wall blocked off the hopes of countless!

There was a line of words by the wall—After all the trouble to get here, it actually only starts here.

Suddenly, the wall trembled, and then a woman in white armor walked out from within. Her figure was tall, and she was extremely beautiful like a goddess.

Once she appeared, six more people walked out from behind the wall of light. All of them wore white armor, had a short sword by their waists, and a spear on their backs.

She glanced at the corpses and said, “See that? At most times, your birth decides your fate. All of you were absolutely lucky to be born in Eternal Kingdom. If you were born in Eternal Border, this is how it’ll end for all of you.”

The six of them lowered their heads behind her and didn’t dare to say anything.

She looked into the distance. An endless river stood before them. She gazed at it for a while before she spoke indifferently, “Heaven on one side, earth on the other; life on one side, death on the other!”

She vanished on the spot once she finished speaking.

The others vanished with her.

At the other side of the Eternal River, she soundlessly descended to the ground, and as soon as her group arrived here, an old man appeared in front of her.

It was the Guardian Qing Xing!

Qing Xing glanced at her and spoke solemnly, “Are you from Eternal Kingdom?”

She nodded, “Where’s Yang Ye?”

Qing Xing spoke solemnly, “Eternal Border!”

She was about to leave when Qing Xing suddenly said, “The desolate race has shown itself!”

She replied indifferently, “So what?”

Qing Xing looked her in the eyes, “Looks like Eternal Kingdom is very confident this time!”

She replied, “Eternal Kingdom isn’t what it used to be. The humiliation we suffered all those years ago will be returned a hundredfold.”

She and the other six of them vanished on the spot and shot toward Abyss World.

Abyss World.

In the Primordial Pagoda, Snowy went over to the two Chaos Fruit Trees. She grinned as she gazed at them, and then she withdrew two World Crystals and placed them below the trees. The trees trembled and started to absorb the crystals.

The trees gradually grew slightly larger, and so did the four fruits.

Besides that, another tiny fruit grew out of each of the trees.

While these two new fruits were very small and just the size of a thumb, they had grown!

Snowy’s eyes lit up from the sight of this, and she hurriedly tossed two more World Crystals below the trees.

Once they finished absorbing the crystals, Snowy patted her paws together and pranced off into the distance. A short while later, she suddenly stopped and gazed at the trees. She blinked, glanced at the surroundings, and vanished on the spot when she failed to notice anything.

Right after Snowy left, the trees trembled, and then two faint auras came from within them.

They were very weak and tiny, but they were there.

With Snowy’s “extravagant” methods of fostering them, they had grown spirits.

Outside the Primordial Pagoda, a group suddenly appeared outside the Abyss World.

It was the group from Eternal Kingdom.

The woman glanced at the surroundings and pressed her palm down.

Bang!

In an instant, the entire Abyss World shuddered, and it seemed like it was about to explode apart!

A single attack capable of destroying a world!

A peak Four World Realm expert!

The woman shot an icy cold gaze down below and slowly clenched her fist, “Show yourself!”

As soon as she finished speaking, she was about to fully clench her fist, but a middle aged man appeared in front of her.

There was a spear floating behind him!
