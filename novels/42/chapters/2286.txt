Chapter 2287 – Hand it Over!

If you want to fight, then let’s fight!

That was Yang Ye’s attitude toward the matter!

Yang Ye could make a compromise, and he could shrink back. Doing so would reduce a huge amount of trouble for him. However, wasn’t it an aggrieving way to live?

Anything someone wants from you, you give them. If they want your wife, should you give them your wife too?

Why should one live an aggrieving life?

Regardless of what others thought, Yang Ye would rather die a free man than live an aggrieving life.

Hanyuan Shu’s face was extremely gloomy. He stared at Yang Ye, “Needless to say, it’s a miracle that someone like you was able to survive until now. Unfortunately, you won’t be that lucky anymore. You…”

Suddenly, Yang Ye vanished on the spot.

Hanyuan Shu’s expression changed drastically, and his folding fan suddenly unfolded. In an instant, a beam of light surged upward from it.

In the beam of light was a huge, ferocious dragon!

In the air above Hanyuan Shu, Yang Ye’s face was quite ferocious as his body suddenly turned ethereal.

The Sword Domain!

Hiss!

Yang Ye’s sword descended, and the huge dragon was instantly sliced into nothingness. As for Hanyuan Shu himself, he was blasted far away. As soon as he stopped himself, he spat out a mouthful of blood.

Hanyuan Shu wiped off the blood on the corner of his mouth, and then he looked up at Yang Ye. A moment later, a ray of sword energy started growing larger and larger within his eyes.

Hanyuan Shu was shocked, and he waved his fan slightly.

Bang!

An ethereal phoenix soared out of the fan, and it grew in midair and instantly grew to almost 3km in length.

It blotted out the sky!

Bang!

Meanwhile, the sword descended, and a deafening explosion resounded!

Hanyuan Shu’s pupils constricted because Yang Ye’s sword had shattered the ethereal phoenix, but Yang Ye had been blasted far away too. But as soon as he stopped himself, Yang Ye transformed into a ray of light that vanished on the spot.

The ray of light was thin as a hair!

It was swift to the extreme!

Hanyuan Shu’s eyes narrowed slightly, and his profound energy circulated madly. In an instant, he swung his folding fan at Yang Ye.

Hiss!

In an instant, two ferocious divine beasts flashed out of the fan. They were a huge dragon and divine phoenix. Both of them instantly grew countless times larger, and the dragon opened its mouth and swallowed Yang Ye’s sword energy. However, the sword energy tore through the dragon and instantly shot forward. However, the phoenix suddenly slammed against the sword energy at this moment.

Bang!

The sword energy was dispersed, and a figure was blasted far away.

It was Yang Ye.

Yang Ye glanced at his chest as he stood far away. The skin there had been scorched black. It had been burned by the phoenix.

Yang Ye glanced at Hanyuan Shu’s folding fan, “That thing isn’t bad at all!”

He was about to attack when a pitch black palm suddenly emerged from the space behind Yang Ye. It appeared just out of thin air, and Yang Ye had only reacted when it pressed against his back!

It was a little too late!

However, a ray of sword energy slashed against it.

Hiss!

A strand of blood sprayed while the hand instantly shrunk back.

Yang Ye immediately flashed to Sword Scroll. It had been Sword Scroll who helped him.

Yang Ye wiped off the blood on the corner of his mouth, “I thought you wouldn’t be helping!”

She spoke indifferently, “Weren’t you really haughty a moment ago?”

Yang Ye replied, “Winning is one thing, but fighting is another thing!”

Sword Scroll glanced at Yang Ye, “Go on boasting. Let me see how you deal with what’s coming.”

As soon as she finished speaking, an old man in black clothes, a woman in a red dress, and a middle aged man with shoulder-length hair appeared around Yang Ye.

There were four True Dao Realm experts with Hanyuan Shu included!

Four True Dao Realm experts!

Yang Ye spoke indifferently, “Whoa! I’m really popular, huh?”

“It’s far beyond anything you’re worth!” Meanwhile, the old man in black clothes said, “If it wasn’t for those three divine treasures, I wouldn’t even spare a glance at an ant like you.”

“An ant?” Yang Ye gazed at the black clothed old man and chuckled, “Old bastard, why don’t we fight one on one?”

“One on one?” The old man spoke with ridicule, “Are you even worthy?”

Suddenly, Yang Ye raised his palm, and a golden little pagoda appeared there.

Everyone here’s expressions changed when they saw it.

The Primordial Pagoda.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly said, “Old bastard, fight me one on one. If you win, this pagoda is yours. Right, the Bodhi Tree and Primordial Axe of Creation are inside it too. Want it?”

The old man’s eyes narrowed slightly, “Looks like you’re very confident and plan to kill me first.”

Yang Ye smiled, “It’s fine, if you’re unwilling to fight me one on one, you can gang up on me. Isn’t it just four True Dao Realm experts? I’m really not afraid of you.”

“The dignified elder of the Yue Clan is afraid?” Suddenly, the beautiful woman spoke softly, “This young man’s a Progenitor. Elder Yue Ming, if others hear that you didn’t even dare to accept a challenge from a young man at the Progenitor Realm, you’ll be the laughingstock of everyone. Moreover, even your Yue Clan will probably lose face.”

The old man glanced at her, “Luoli Xian, you think I don’t know what you’re planning?”

She chuckled, “What can a weak woman like me be planning? Stop wasting time. If you’re unwilling to accept this young man’s challenge, then let’s kill him together and decide who gets those three treasures.”

The old man replied indifferently, “Then let’s fight together.”

He was naturally no fool. He wasn’t afraid of fighting Yang Ye in single combat, of course. But who would stand to gain in the end? It was the others around him. So, while he wanted to crush Yang Ye right now, he still didn’t agree to it.

Face?

Was it worth any money? So long as Yang Ye was dead, who would care about it anyway? In just a day, the world would forget Yang Ye ever existed.

The woman glanced at the old man and smiled, “Alright.”

She gazed at Yang Ye, “Young Brother, you look extraordinary to me. If you’re willing to hand over those three treasures, Big Sister will guarantee your safety, alright?”

Yang Ye gazed at her and replied indifferently, “I need someone to keep my bed warm. Big Sister, if you’re willing to do that and give me some special service, I’ll guarantee your safety, alright?” CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“Special service?” She chuckled and sized up Yang Ye’s groin, “Young Brother, Big Sister is afraid you won’t be able to endure it. Hehe…”

Yang Ye replied indifferently, “I’m afraid you won’t be able to endure it!”

The woman walked close to Yang Ye and looked him in the eye while the smile on her face gradually vanished, “I know you’re buying time, and you’re probably using Primordial Violet Energy to heal so that you’ll be back at your peak. However, I can tell you that there are four True Dao Realm experts here. If we join forces, killing you is absolutely easy. So, stop mouthing off. I’ll ask you one last time, will you hand it over or not?”

As soon as she finished speaking, the auras of all four experts here enveloped Yang Ye.
