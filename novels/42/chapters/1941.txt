Chapter 1942 – A Familiar Voice!

Lord? Yang Ye gazed at the middle aged man.

Meanwhile, the middle aged man smiled, “Are you curious about my identity?”

Yang Ye nodded, “A little!”

The middle aged man smiled, “You know Gu Nie, right?”

Yang Ye nodded slightly, “I do!”

The middle aged man revealed something that shocked Yang Ye, “He’s my younger brother!”

Yang Ye gazes at the middle aged man with astonishment, and there was bewilderment in his eyes.

The smile on the middle aged man’s face gradually became icy cold, “I’m Gu Hai, the Divine General who used to guard the Endless Ocean, and Gu Nie was my younger brother. A few dozens of years ago, he suddenly rose up in revolt, and he caught me off guard with the help of outsiders. In the end, my brothers and I were captured. As for me, he severed my arms and legs before sealing my cultivation!”

Yang Ye shook his head slightly, “I don’t understand why he didn’t just kill you.”

“Why would he?” Gu Hai smiled, “He hasn’t gotten the precious treasure of our clan, the Ocean Soul, and he won’t kill me until he gets it!”

Yang Ye nodded, “Since you’re free now, I’ll be bidding my farewells!”

Yang Ye intended to leave once he finished speaking.

Suddenly, the middle aged man said, “You can’t leave for now!”

Yang Ye stopped, looked up, and said, “As expected.”

A group had appeared above them, and it was led by Gu Nie. There was a gray robed old man by Gu Nie’s side.

At this moment, Gu Nie’s expression was extremely gloomy, and he was staring at Gu Hai.

“The heavens really do play tricks on us!” Gu Hai suddenly chuckled, “Even I never expected that I would be able to escape. My good younger brother, your older brother has escaped, so why don’t you look happy at all?”

Gu Nie gazed at Yang Ye, “I should have disregarded everything and killed you that day! But it’s fine, it isn’t too late to kill you right now!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he clawed at Yang Ye from afar.

Bang!

The space around Yang Ye suddenly started trembling, and then the water around him shot towards him.

Yang Ye was about to counterattack when a pearl of water flashed, and it slammed against the torrent of water.

Bang!

The torrent exploded apart! 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Yang Ye gazed at Gu Hai because it was Gu Hai who’d helped him deal with that attack!

“I owe this young brother here, so you can’t kill him!” Gu Hai chuckled, and then he gazed at the gray robed old man by Gu Nie’s side, “Elder Yu, I really don’t understand why you would help my younger brother to launch a surprise attack against me!”

The old man glanced at Gu Hai and replied, “It’s meaningless to talk about all of that, isn’t it?”

Gu Hai nodded, “You’re very right!”

Suddenly, Gu Nie vanished on the spot. As soon as he vanished, the water in the surroundings started to boil, and then it slammed down towards Yang Ye and the others!

A cold smile curled up on the corners of Gu Hai’s mouth, “Are you in that much of a rush to kill us and keep your secret safe?”

As soon as he finished speaking, he raised his hands and pushed them outwards.

Bang! Bang!

In an instant, the water around them seemed to have been obstructed by something and stopped on the spot.

Meanwhile, a figure appeared in front of Gu Hai.

Bang!

Gu Hai was blasted over 1km away. As soon as he stopped himself, an ethereal spear had arrived before his forehead.

Gu Hai’s face was calm. He clenched his right fist and slammed it forward.

Bang!

In an instant, a black vortex appeared in front of him. The black vortex swallowed Gu Nie’s spear. However, a strand of dark blue water had suddenly descended from the sky and arrived above Gu Hai…

Yang Ye didn’t continue watching the battle. He glanced at the surroundings and started sneaking backwards.

It was the best opportunity to leave!

Everyone’s gazes were on Gu Nie and Gu Hai, so no one noticed Yang Ye.

Just like that, Yang Ye transformed into a speck of light that vanished upwards.

Bang!

Suddenly, a figure crashed down from above.

Boom!

The figure slammed against the ground and caused a huge expanse of water in the ocean to ripple.

Everyone looked towards the figure. It was none other than Yang Ye who’d almost escaped just now.

Yang Ye stood up and glanced at his right hand. At this moment, his right hand had cracked open. He fell silent for a moment, and then he looked up. A bald man had suddenly appeared not too far above him.

The man seemed to be around the age of 30, and his figure was exceptionally robust. He was more than twice the size of an ordinary person. His arms were covered in bulging muscles, and they seemed to be filled with explosive strength.

Besides the robust man, there was an extremely enchanting woman not too far away from him.

It was the bald man who’d stopped Yang Ye from leaving.

“Extraordinary indeed!” Meanwhile, the bald man suddenly spoke, “Few in the 6th stage of the True Realm can take a punch of mine.”

Yang Ye glanced at the bald man and the beautiful woman, “Which race are both of you from?”

The bald man replied indifferently, “I’m from the demon race, and she’s from the devil race! Our goal is simple. Hand over the sword, and we’ll let you leave!”

“Let me leave?” Yang Ye chuckled. Does he think I’m an idiot?

If Yang Ye was someone without potential and couldn’t be a threat to them, then they may be benevolent enough to take the sword but not his life. However, Yang Ye was someone who could pose a threat to them!

Even though he was no threat to them now, he would definitely be one in the future!

So, as soon as he handed over the sword, it would be the moment they attacked to kill him!

“Kuang Shi! Why waste your breath on him?” Suddenly, the beautiful woman smiled, “He’s not an idiot. He won’t be fooled by you.”

The bald man nodded slightly, and then he swung a punch at Yang Ye.

Bang!

Yang Ye’s pupils constricted. At this moment, he felt like his entire body was about to be crushed!

Yang Ye didn’t dare act carelessly, and he raised his sword and swung it.

Boom!

As soon as he swung his sword, his figure was blasted away. Kuang Shi took a step forward and intended to attack again. However, Gu Hai’s figure flashed and appeared before Yang Ye.

Kuang Shi frowned when he witnessed this, “What?”

Gu Hai glanced at Kuang Shi, and then he looked at Yang Ye, “How are you feeling?”

Yang Ye wiped off the blood on the corner of his mouth, “I’ll live!”

Gu Hai gave Yang Ye a thumbs up, “Enduring a Know Dao Realm experts’ full strength at the 6th stage of the True Realm. I truly admire you. I was far inferior to you, all those years ago!”

Yang Ye shook his head, “I’m still too weak!”

Gu Hai smiled, “Take it slow!”

He gazed at Kuang Shi and said, “Which demon king do you serve?”

Kuang Shi spoke indifferently, “What? You want to stop me?”

Gu Hao smiled, “This young brother here saved my life, and I’m truly unable to ungratefully. Give me some face and spare him, alright?”

Kuang Shi’s face turned cold, and he slowly clenched his fists. Suddenly, the beautiful woman smiled, “You should think this through!”

Gu Hao gazed at her, and she grinned, “We won’t interfere in your business with your younger brother because it’s your own family’s affairs. However, we hope you won’t interfere in our business too. If you insist on interfering, then hehe! While we don’t want to interfere in your family’s business, we may have to make an exception today!”

Gu Hai’s face instantly fell when he heard this.

The beautiful woman continued, “Your strength is on par with your younger brother, and you may even be slightly stronger than him. If we don’t interfere, then you’ll have a huge chance of taking control of the Endless Ocean. However, if we interfere, I wonder if you’ll have even the slightest chance!”

Gu Hai spoke coldly, “Are you threatening me?”

The beautiful woman smiled, “You can treat it like that!”

Gu Hai’s face became gloomy. Suddenly, an old man behind him said, “Don’t act rashly. The important matter at hand is eliminating Gu Nie and taking back the Endless Ocean. This human isn’t worth risking our lives on!”

Gu Hai fell silent. However, he clenched both his fists.

The old man said, “If they join the battle, we’ll be facing three Know Dao Realm experts. Coupled with the fact that we’ve just escaped and are still weak, it’s extremely disadvantageous to us. So, please prioritize our main objective!”

Gu Hai closed his eyes slowly.

Everyone here gazed at Gu Hai.

A long time passed before Gu Hai suddenly opened his eyes and smiled, “How can a person be ungrateful?”

He gazed at Yang Ye and continued, “Young Brother, I can’t help much, and I can only send you on your way. The rest will depend on you!”

He waved his right hand once he finished speaking, “Come!”

As soon as he commanded, a dark ray of light shot up into the air from deep within the ocean, and then it traveled through space and arrived before Gu Hai.

It was a fist-sized pearl!

“The Ocean Soul!” Gu Nie’s expression changed drastically!

Meanwhile, Gu Hai suddenly appeared before Yang Ye and waved his right hand. A spatial rift instantly appeared in front of Yang Ye, and then he grabbed Yang Ye’s shoulder and pushed Yang Ye into the spatial rift.

A moment later, space returned to normal.

Kuang Shi’s expression turned extremely gloomy, “Don’t let him get away!”

Suddenly, Gu Hai tapped the Ocean Soul. In an instant, an enormous part of the ocean suddenly started rippling, and then the ocean water here transformed into waves that slammed down at Kuang Shi and the beautiful woman!

“Dammit!” Kuang Shi cursed furiously beneath the waves.

…

In the clouds very far away from the Endless Ocean, the space there trembled, and then a figure flashed out from there.

It was Yang Ye!

Yang Ye glanced in the direction of the Endless Ocean. At this moment, the ocean was rippling, and it seemed like it was boiling!

Yang Ye remained silent for a moment, and then he withdrew his gaze and intended to leave. Suddenly, a voice resounded from behind him, “You’re still as strong as always!”

Yang Ye stopped.

The voice was quite familiar!
