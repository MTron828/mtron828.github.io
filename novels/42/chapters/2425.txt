Chapter 2426 – You’re Not Qualified!FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Hiss!

The sound of something being torn apart resounded, and then the space before the sword cultivator was sliced open.

An instant later, the middle aged man’s figure turned ethereal.

The sword cultivator sheathed his sword and walked away.

Meanwhile, the middle aged man suddenly said, “Someone like you shouldn’t exist in this world!”

The sword cultivator stopped, “All of you aren’t from this world!”

The middle aged man nodded, “We aren’t!”

The sword cultivator said, “Based on your main body’s strength, there should be very few capable of killing you. So, how did you die?”

The middle aged man smiled, “This is how the world is. You think you’re very strong, but there are those who are stronger. There’s always someone stronger, right?”

The sword cultivator glanced at the surroundings, “I hope someone can defeat me. Only defeat can allow me to locate new flaws in myself. Unfortunately, I’ve gone in search of many, but none have been able to defeat me. As far as I’m concerned, the moment I’m defeated is the moment my Sword Dao begins.”

The middle aged man fell silent for a short while and said, “You will!”

The sword cultivator nodded, “I hope it happens soon. Otherwise, this life and Sword Dao are too meaningless!”

The sword cultivator vanished once he finished speaking.

The middle aged man glanced in the direction the sword cultivator had vanished, “He’s really strong…”

As soon as he finished speaking, the middle aged man’s figure gradually turned ethereal, and then it vanished completely.

…

Not long after Yang Ye left the Abyss World, a young man and an old man appeared before him.

The young man was Huang Ying.

Huang Ying grinned, “Can we talk?”

Yang Ye replied indifferently, “What do you think?”

Huang Ying smiled, “One more friend is better than another enemy. Don’t you think so too?”

Yang Ye nodded, “Then let’s talk.”

Huang Yin gestured at Yang Ye to follow him, “Please come with me!”

Yang Ye glanced at Huang Ying and was about to go when he suddenly looked into the distance. A woman was leading six other men in white armor toward them.

It didn’t take long for the woman to stop.

She glanced at Yang Ye, “She belongs to Eternal Kingdom!”

Yang Ye replied indifferently, “And I think you belong to me. So do you belong to me because of that?”

She replied, “I belong to you? If you have the strength, then so what if I do?”

Yang Ye smiled, “Alright, let me guess. You’re an unfamiliar face, so you probably aren’t from Eternal Border. If I’m not wrong, you should be from Eternal Kingdom, right?”

She nodded and walked over to Yang Ye, “The Sprite Progenitor belongs to Eternal Kingdom. Give her to me. She’ll be safer there, and her life will be better. At least it’ll be better than staying with you.”

Yang Ye smiled and gazed at Huang Ying, “What do you think about that?”

Huang Ying smiled, “Brother Yang, that’s terrible of you. You want us to fight to the death, and then you’ll flee with the Sprite Progenitor. Brother Yang, that won’t work.”

Yang Ye smiled, “Did you say it’s better to have a friend? Now, it’s time to prove if we’re friends.”

Huang Ying gazed at Yang Ye for a long time and smiled, “Alright!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he glanced at the woman, “If I were you, I’d leave right now.”

She didn’t speak and just charged at Yang Ye.

Because they were very close, it only took an instant for her to appear before Yang Ye. An instant later, countless golden threads rained down upon Yang Ye like a storm. It was extremely fast to the point they instantly enveloped Yang Ye.

Meanwhile, a sword howl resounded.

Boom!

An explosion resounded, and the golden threads dispersed. The woman moved around 30m back, but it only took a moment for the space around Yang Ye to crack open, and then countless golden threads shot out from the cracks toward Yang Ye!

Yang Ye swung his sword horizontally.

Boom!

The golden threads were blasted away again, but a powerful aura swept over immediately.

Yang Ye stabbed his sword forward.

Bang!

Yang Ye and the woman moved backward repeatedly.

They stopped after being pushed around 30m back each. Yang Ye stood there with his sword in hand while golden threads floated behind the woman. However, they were broken.

She glanced at the sword in Yang Ye’s grasp, “What a great sword…”

Her pupils suddenly constricted at this point, “Impossible! It’s that sword!”

Yang Ye grinned, and then he vanished on the spot. A moment later, a brilliant ray of sword energy slashed down from above her.

The Sword Domain!

Four swings!

The woman’s pupils constricted at the sight of the sword energy, and she pressed her palm down slightly. In an instant, countless threads of golden light swept out from her.

Bang!

The sword descended. The woman and the golden light were instantly blasted over 10km away. As soon as she stopped herself, the golden light exploded apart, and she was pushed over 30m back.

Once she finally stopped herself, blood seeped out of the corner of her mouth.

Huang Ying glanced at Yang Ye and grinned, “Brother Yang, that’s quite some strength you have.”

Yang Ye ignored him and was about to attack.

Suddenly, the woman soared up into the air, and then an ethereal spear condensed in her grasp. An instant later, she shot at him with the spear.

Yang Ye tightened his grip on his sword, and then he drew it!

Hiss!

Along with the sound of something being torn open, two figures were blasted away.

They were Yang Ye and the woman, and they only stopped after being pushed around 300m back.

They gazed at each other from afar!

Yang Ye took a step back and swung his sword.

Hiss!

A brilliant ray of sword energy shot forward.

The woman stretched out her hand and twisted it slightly.

Hiss!

The space before her exploded apart, and then a wave of powerful energy rippled out from there.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

The sky exploded apart, and then a ray of sword energy and golden light slammed against each other in the black hole.

Just like that, the sky rippled for almost 15 minutes before finally calming down.

Yang Ye and the woman stood far apart from each other within the black hole.

She gazed at Yang Ye while feeling slight shock. She hadn’t expected him to fight her equally! After all, her cultivation far surpassed Yang Ye’s, and she was from Eternal Kingdom!

The civilization of cultivation there was far superior than what it was here!

But at this moment, she had no confidence in being able to defeat this young sword cultivator who stood before her!

Yang Ye closed his eyes slowly.

The peak of the Four World Realm!

She was at least a peak Four World Realm expert. While he hadn’t used all his trump cards, he’d used his full strength, yet he still couldn’t do anything to her.

There was quite a gap between him and a peak Four World Realm expert.

This battle allowed him to gain a rough understanding of his strength.

Yang Ye looked up at her, and she raised her right hand before lightly bringing it down.

The six experts in white armor vanished on the spot behind her.

An instant later, Yang Ye sensed six powerful auras before him.

Four World Realm experts!

All the auras belonged to Four World Realm experts. While they were slightly weaker than the woman, their joint forces were extremely terrifying, and their auras almost suffocated Yang Ye!

He felt suffocated!

The woman clearly planned to gang up on him and stop fighting him in single combat. After all, it was a waste of time and energy!

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly when facing these six powerful auras, and he was about to attack. However, Huang Ying and the old man suddenly appeared by his sides. Huang Ying grinned and waved his right hand. In an instant, a ray of pitch black light rippled out of his palm.

Meanwhile, the old man suddenly raised his hands and pressed them down.

Yang Ye didn’t stand by idly. He too swung his sword.

A powerful strand of sword intent rippled out!

Their joint forces were able to forcefully fend off the pressure from those six experts.

Moreover, those six experts were even pushed back.

Once they succeeded at doing that, Huang Ying glanced at Yang Ye and left.

Yang Ye left with them. In an instant, they vanished into the distance.

Huang Ying’s intentions were clear. He helped push them back, but he wouldn’t help Yang Ye fight them to the death. If Yang Ye didn’t leave, he would abandon Yang Ye. He didn’t want to be used by Yang Ye!

Yang Ye naturally understood that, and he was very well aware that his own strength wasn’t sufficient to kill them. So, he’d decisively chosen to leave.

The six experts were about to give chase, but the woman stopped them.

She gazed at the direction they’d fled toward for a very long time, and then she said, “Ask for a Five World Realm expert to be sent here.”

One of them hesitated for a moment and asked, “Is that necessary?”

She glanced coldly at that expert, “If we don’t annihilate someone like him, he’ll become a huge threat in the future! Moreover, the situation in Eternal Border is complicated, and the desolate race has shown itself. So, we don’t have any advantage.”

She looked up into the distant sky, “The Sprite Progenitor must come under our control!”

She turned around and walked away.

Suddenly, a sword cultivator in a cloud white robe appeared nearby. She stopped and glanced at him.

He seemed very ordinary, and there was nothing outstanding about him.

He glanced at her and asked, “Is Eternal Kingdom to the right?”

She replied indifferently, “You want to go to Eternal Kingdom?”

He nodded, “I want to have a look.”

She shook her head, “Don’t.”

He was puzzled, “Why?”

She looked him in the eyes, “You’re not qualified!”
