Chapter 1712 - I’ll Kill Everyone Related To You!

For the sake of cultivating, he’d just hidden himself in a corner of Li Taibai’s palace. Now that he’d returned to the outside world, he noticed that there were a few dozen people here.

Every single one of them was holding a sword or carrying a sword on their backs.

Sword cultivators!

They were those sword cultivators who’d been in Sword Immortal City!

Yang Ye glanced at them, and then he turned around and walked away. Meeting Li Taibai and gaining Li Taibai’s inheritance had been the reason why he’d come to Phoenix Cry Mountain. However, that had been in the past. Now, he wasn’t interested in Li Taibai’s inheritance at all!

He’d gained something that was even more important than Li Taibai’s inheritance!

“Wait!” Suddenly, a voice resounded.

Yang Ye stopped and turned to look. A man was walking in his direction. The man had a green robe on him, and he was around the age of 25.

The man said, “If I’m not wrong, you’re that fellow, Yang Ye, who the Yang Clan issued a warrant for, right?”

Yang Ye!

The other sword cultivators gazed at Yang Ye. They’d seen him in Sword Immortal City, but many hadn’t been able to recall it immediately.

Yang Ye glanced at the man and nodded, “Yes!”

The man grinned, “Don’t worry, we aren’t interested in the Yang Clan’s rewards!”

“Worried?” Yang Ye was slightly stunned, and then he shook his head, “I’m not worried.”

The man smiled, “Let’s not talk about that. There’s something else I’d like to ask about.”

Yang Ye replied, “Go on!”

Yang Ye was such a person. If you spoke nicely to him, he would reply nicely. It worked both ways.

The man said, “You got here a long time ago, right?”

Yang Ye nodded, “Sort of!”

A smile curled up on the corners of the man’s mouth, “So, you met the Sword Immortal, Li Taibai?”

Yang Ye nodded, “I did!”

Everyone here was visibly excited when they heard him, and the smile on the man’s mouth gradually grew wider.

The man said, “The Sword Immortal’s inheritance is in your possession, right?”

So that’s what he wants! Yang Ye understood what the man wanted, and he understood what the other sword cultivators here were thinking. He glanced at them and said, “The Sword Immortal’s inheritance is in my possession, and I understand what all of you want. However, the Sword Immortal gave it to me!”

Even though he refused to use Li Taibai’s inheritance, he wouldn’t just casually give it away.

The expressions of the others instantly turned gloomy when they heard him, and many even revealed hostility in their eyes.

Meanwhile, the man said, “Brother Yang, that’s not very nice, isn’t it? We rushed over from all over this universe just to meet the Sword Immortal and gain his inheritance. Yet now, you’re taking it for yourself. That’s really not very nice!”

Yang Ye glanced at them and shook his head. He didn’t say a word and just walked away.

The man’s face turned even gloomier when Yang Ye ignored him, and then he vanished on the spot.

Yang Ye suddenly stopped when the man’s figure vanished, and then the surroundings fell silent.

The man had appeared before Yang Ye, but a sword was pressed against the center of his forehead!

The sword was held in Yang Ye’s grasp!

Everyone here was stunned, including the man. His eyes were filled with disbelief because he hadn’t seen how Yang Ye had attacked!

He wasn’t the only one, all the others here hadn’t seen it as well!

All of them just saw the man vanish, and then a sword was pressed against his forehead!

Yang Ye looked the man in the eyes and said, “If it’s yours, it’s yours; if it isn’t, then don’t try to get it by force. Understand?”

Yang Ye withdrew his sword once he finished speaking, and then he walked towards the exit.

Suddenly, the man roared with fury, “The Sword Immortal’s inheritance is in his possession. If you don’t want to have come here for nothing, then join forces and kill him! Make…”

Suddenly, the man’s voice stopped abruptly, and then his head tilted to the side and rolled off his neck.

Blood sprayed out like a torrent!

After staying stunned for a moment, all of them gazed at Yang Ye. Yang Ye didn’t stop and just continued forward.

Someone suddenly asked, “He did it?”

Someone else answered, “He didn’t! He was always just walking!”

Another one said, “Impossible! He definitely did it!”

“How did he do it?” Along with this question, silence suddenly filled the area.

After he left the palace, Yang Ye tapped his right foot against the ground and shot up into the air. But it didn’t take long for him to stop because a man and a woman had appeared before him.

He recognized them both. It was Li Fengyu and Qin Lincang!

Qin Lincang spoke solemnly, “What sword technique was that?!”

Yang Ye glanced at them and said, “I don’t think I’m obligated to tell you!”

Qin Lincang frowned slightly. She fell silent for a moment and said, “Your strength is much stronger than before. Is it because of the Sword Immortal’s inheritance?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “It isn’t. I have other matters to attend to. Farewell!”

“Brother! Wait a moment!” Meanwhile, Li Fengyu suddenly said, “Brother Yang, we hold no ill intent towards you. We’ve just never seen such a powerful sword technique as the one you just executed. Brother Yang, you’re a sword cultivator, so you should understand how we feel!”

Yang Ye glanced at them and said, “Make your move!”

Li Fengyu and Qin Lincang exchanged glances, and then Qin Lincang vanished on the spot. She was in front of Yang Ye when she appeared again. In an instant, three rays of light stabbed towards Yang Ye’s forehead, nape, and heart from three different directions!

Every single one of them was lethal!

Yang Ye didn’t move at all! Right when the rays of light were less than half an inch away from hitting him…

Om!

A sword howl suddenly resounded, and then the three rays of light shattered and were instantly obliterated. It was like they were never there.

As for Yang Ye, he was still standing there, and it was like he’d never attacked!

Both Qin Lincang and Li Fengyu were stunned by this scene, and they had extremely solemn expressions on their faces.

A moment of silence ensued, and then Qin Lincang suddenly took a step forward. A wave of powerful sword intent swept out from within her, and it slammed down upon Yang Ye like a tidal wave. Everywhere it passed, even space warped! It was absolutely shocking!

True Rank sword intent!

Suddenly, Yang Ye’s wrist moved slightly, and then the powerful True Rank sword intent before him vanished instantly without a trace.

Qin Lincang and Li Fengyu were stunned.

Om!

Meanwhile, a sword howl resounded, but there was no sword energy to see.

Qin Lincang and Li Fengyu’s eyes instantly opened wide when they heard it, and their eyes were filled with disbelief.

Yang Ye’s sword was so swift that it surpassed sound! No, it didn’t just surpass sound, it far surpassed the speed of sound!

Most importantly, Yang Ye hadn’t executed any techniques just now, or even utilized sword intent. But it was just such an attack that had destroyed her True Rank sword intent!

Qin Lincang remained silent for a long time before she spoke solemnly, “Why is your attack that fast and that strong?!”

Yang Ye asked, “Want to know?”

She nodded, “What are your conditions?”

A smile curled up on the corners of Yang Ye’s mouth, “I’ll be returning to the Yang Clan, but I’m quite a timid person. So, I’m looking for some people to accompany me there. Are you willing to go with me?”

The Yang Clan! Their eyelids twitched when they heard him. They naturally knew what Yang Ye’s return to the Yang Clan represented! Yang Ye intended to go back and take revenge!

Both of them fell silent.

Even though they were geniuses amongst geniuses, and were even experts on the Milky Way Rankings, they were definitely nothing before an ancient clan like the Yang Clan. So, if they went to the Yang Clan with Yang Ye, they had a 99% chance of dying there!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly smiled, “I won’t force both of you!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he turned around and walked away.

The Yang Clan was a place he was determined to return to. However, he wasn’t a fool, so he wouldn’t try to fight the Yang Clan on his own. Even though his strength had improved tremendously, the Yang Clan was a large clan. Moreover, Yang Xiao’s strength was still mysterious and unfathomable to him. Even now, he still wasn’t confident in his ability to defeat the Yang Clan’s patriarch!

Not to mention that the Yang Clan was an ancient clan, so it definitely had unknown trump cards.

If he returned rashly, he would only be throwing his life away!

So, if he could get help, he intended to do so. Of course, he would still return even if he couldn’t get any help. However, he wouldn’t refuse if people were willing to go with him.

Even though Qin Lincang and Li Fengyu were at the Zenith Realm, their strength was absolutely sufficient to fight True Realm experts. After all, both of them possessed True Realm sword intent.

However, they were hesitant, and Yang Ye would naturally not beg people to go back to the Yang Clan with him. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

It was good if he had help; but he wasn’t afraid if he didn’t!

Yang Ye left in a very decisive manner.

Suddenly, Qin Lincang said, “I’ll go with you!”

Yang Ye stopped and gazed at her, “Are you sure?”

She nodded, “I am.”

Yang Ye nodded slightly, “Alright.” He gazed at Li Fengyu while he spoke.

Li Fengyu pondered deeply for a moment and shook his head, “Brother Yang, I’m sorry. As a member of the Li Clan, I can’t get mixed up in the business of your Yang Clan.”

The Li Clan!

One of the eight large clans!

Yang Ye nodded, “I understand!”

Yang Ye gazed at Qin Lincang, and then he flicked a scroll to her, “That’s the Sword Immortal’s inheritance! It’s yours now!”

Qin Lincang glanced at the scroll before her and gazed at Yang Ye, “You learned that attack from here?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “I never looked at it. Because I have my own path. That sword technique is something I created myself, and it belongs only to me. You can’t learn it. Allow me to give you a piece of advice as well. Don’t constantly imitate others. Of course, learning is extremely important, but you must have your own things too.”

Qin Lincang fell silent for a long time, and then she said, “Thank you for your guidance.” As she spoke, she took a glance at the contents of the scroll, and then her face gradually became extremely solemn.

A long time passed before she looked up at Yang Ye, “Now, I believe what you said just now. You really haven’t taken a look at the Sword Immortal’s inheritance.”

Yang Ye asked, “Why?”

She replied, “Because you wouldn’t give it up if you had.” She paused for a moment and continued, “It’s extremely formidable. Are you sure you want to give it up?”

Yang Ye grinned but didn’t say anything.

Suddenly, the space in front of Yang Ye trembled slightly, and then a woman appeared before him. Yang Ye recognized her, it was Qin Youshui!

Yang Ye frowned slightly. Meanwhile, Qin Youshui spoke solemnly, “My clan received news that the Yang Clan has sent its forces to Merak System. They intend to capture your friends and wives that are there.”

Yang Ye’s face instantly became cold.

He remained silent for a moment, and then he suddenly took a deep breath, “Touch my loved ones and I’ll kill everyone related to you!”
