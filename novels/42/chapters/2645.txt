Chapter 2646 – Blood!

Yang Ye ignored Tai Huntian and the others, and he just flashed up into the sky.

Once Yang Ye vanished on the spot, the black clothed figure glanced at Tai Huntian and slowly vanished on the spot.

He had something more important to do!

Along with Yang Ye’s arrival there, the battle in the sky instantly came to a stop.

Sky Maiden glanced at Yang Ye with a questioning gaze.

Yang Ye nodded slightly, and she visibly relaxed.

Her goal was to keep them busy to create an opportunity for Yang Ye to rescue the mothers.

Now that they’d been rescued, her objective was to kill them.

Sky Maiden said, “Take them and leave!”

Yang Ye shook his head.

Sky Maiden frowned slightly, “Listen to me!”

Yang Ye gazed at the Nether Lord, “Eldest Sister, just let me do something. Otherwise, I think I’ll go mad.”

Strands of slaughter intent condensed out of thin air.

Sky Maiden gazed at him for a long time, and then she charged at the Death Lord.

The Death Lord frowned when he saw her attack. They were only barely able to fight her in a two on one battle, now that it was one on one, he was even less confident. However, he couldn’t flee now. Because she would never let him.

The Death Lord closed his eyes slowly, and then the space around them was suddenly filled with boundless Death Energy!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye walked toward the Nether Lord. At this moment, there was no slaughter intent around him because all of his slaughter intent and sword intent had converged into his sword.

The Nether Lord gazed at Yang Ye ferociously, “What? You plan to kill me on your own? Unfortunately, I’m afraid you’re not qualified for that.”

Yang Ye didn’t waste his breath and just appeared before the Nether Lord.

His sword descended!

The Domain Sword!

The Nether Lord didn’t try to dodge. A pitch black saber appeared in his grasp, and then it was covered in boundless Death Energy and vengeful spirits as it descended upon Yang Ye!

Boom!

A rumbling explosion resounded, and they instantly split apart. At the same time, countless rays of sword energy, Death Energy, and vengeful spirits erupted through the sky.

Suddenly, a ray of sword energy flashed.

A moment later, a sword slashed down at the Nether Lord once more.

The Nether Lord smiled fiercely as he greeted it with his saber.

Boom!

An explosion resounded and the Nether Lord was blasted away!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye charged over again.

Swing after swing of the sword!

He was being suppressed!

No one had expected Yang Ye to actually suppress the Nether Lord. After all, the Nether Lord was a peak Destiny Realm expert of this world!

On the other side, Tai Huntian walked over to the Divine Abode’s master’s group. He glanced at them and shook his head, “All of your cultivations in the Destiny Realm aren’t truly solid!”

The Divine Abode’s master spoke indifferently, “You don’t seem to know Yang Ye very well?”

Tai Huntian shook his head, “I don’t. I owe him a favor. I’ll decide whether I should kill him once I’ve returned the favor. I really can’t stand the sight of his arrogance.”

The Divine Abode’s master chuckled, “Looks like you’re not aware of the current situation.”

Tai Huntian shook his head, “I don’t want to know. Most of those fellows from my era are probably dead by now. Alright, let’s cut the crap. It’s time for you to die.”

He was about to attack as he spoke, but the Divine Above’s master and the others moved aside.

Meanwhile, the space beside them cracked open slowly, and a man emerged from there.

The man looked to be around the age of 30. His hair hung loosely down to his shoulders, and he wore an ancient-looking robe while a black cloth covered his eyes.

There was a saber hanging by his waist on the left.

The saber was over a meter long, and it was covered in hair-thin black threads. Its hilt was quite unique or it should be described as too simple. It was just a wooden hilt that was pitch black.

The man’s left hand was on its sheath.

Once he appeared here, Tai Huntian frowned. He sized up the man and said, “Interesting.”

The man looked to the side for a moment, and then he shook his head, “Your strength isn’t even at 70% of your prime. This battle is meaningless. You can leave.”

Tai Huntian grinned, “I can still kill you with that!”

Meanwhile, the man took a step forward.

The saber was drawn by an inch.

Bang!

An invisible wave of saber energy surged out like a torrent.

Bam!

Tai Huntian was blasted over 300m back!

There was a curved spatial rift in the space between them.

The saber energy was truly extraordinarily powerful!

Tai Huntian’s face turned solemn at this moment. If he were at his peak, he wouldn’t fear the man before him, but he wasn’t.

The man took another step forward, and another inch of his saber left its sheath.

Hiss!

A sharp sound resounded, and then a strand of saber energy suddenly appeared before Tai Huntian.

Tai Huntian’s eyes narrowed slightly. At this moment, his gaze was extremely solemn!

He didn’t go head-on against this attack, and he just moved 300m back to dodge it!

The man glanced at Tai Huntian, and then his saber returned back into its sheath.VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Tia Huntian gazed at the man for a long time and left.

He refused to continue fighting!

He had no chance!

“What? You’re not fulfilling your promise?” Meanwhile, the black clothed figure from before suddenly appeared here.

Tai Huntian glanced coldly at the black clothed figure, “I’m still severely injured, so I’m no match for him. As for that promise, I’ve helped him kill someone earlier…”

The black clothed figure asked, “Didn’t you say that you would repay him tenfold?”

Tai Huntian replied indifferently, “I’ll do as I please. Do you have a problem?”

The black clothed figure shook his head and smiled, “None at all. You can leave.”

Tai Huntian grunted coldly and was about to leave. Suddenly, the Divine Abode’s master said, “Please wait a moment.”

Tai Huntian turned around to gaze at him, “What? You’re planning on killing me?”

The Divine Abode’s master shook his head, “Your strength has weakened, and you are covered in Death Energy and Yin Energy, so you’re in a state of suspended animation. That is why you were able to escape Destiny. But now that you’re out here, your powerful strength is very likely to draw the attention of Destiny!”

Destiny!

Tai Huntian glanced at the surroundings, and a trace of fear flashed through his eyes.

Destiny!

Why had he fallen into this current state? Why had his own disciple schemed against him?

It was because he’d gone with the others to go head-on against Destiny, and then he almost died as soon as he tried!

The Divine Abode’s master smiled, “You may not know but Destiny has shown herself again. I guarantee that based on your level of strength, you have a 60 or 70% chance of being detected by Destiny once you leave this place. At that time…”

Tai Huntian stared at him, “What are you trying to say?”

The Divine Abode’s master smiled, “There is a place in this world known as the End World, and you can stay there with us. It hasn’t collapsed yet, so it can conceal us from Destiny. All of us reside there.”

Tai Huntian frowned slightly.

The Divine Abode’s master added, “All of us are being pursued by Destiny. We are not enemies. Not only can you hide from Destiny there, there are many others like you there. What do you think?”

Tai Huntian fell silent for a short while and said, “I’ll go have a look then! I have nothing to do anyway!”

The Divine Abode’s master grinned, and then he gazed at Shui Wubian, “Shui Wubian, I’ll leave it to you.”

Shui Wubian nodded, and then he vanished on the spot with Tai Huntian.

Meanwhile, the Divine Abode’s master gazed at the black clothed figure. At this moment, the black clothed figure had turned fully ethereal.

He’d left!

The Divine Abode’s master gazed at the man by his side, “Lord Zuo Mu, can you help?”

The man known as Zuo Mu shook his head slightly and vanished on the spot.

The Divine Abode’s master and the others felt quite helpless.

Experts like Zuo Mu and Heng Wangu were absolutely powerful, but at the same time, they were extremely afraid of the world. Because besides within the End World itself, it was very easy for them to be noticed by Destiny while they were in any other world!

The stronger someone was, the easier it was for them to be detected. Especially when they fought!

Previously, all of them weren’t that afraid of Destiny anymore because she hadn’t been seen for a very, very long time.

But Destiny had shown herself again during the battle in the Origin World. This instilled fear in countless overlords! Especially the incident with the Desolate Emperor, his death was directly linked to Destiny!

If it hadn’t been an emergency earlier, Zuo Mu wouldn’t have shown himself at all. Moreover, even then, Zuo Mu hadn’t drawn his saber. It wasn’t that he feared Tai Huntian, it was that he didn’t wish to reveal his strength.

Now that the Divine Abode’s master wanted Zuo Mu to fight Sky Maiden and Yang Ye, he’d decisively refused.

Because he’d stayed out here long enough!

He didn’t want to see the woman in black, or the woman in white!

Once he left, the Divine Abode’s master looked into the distance.

Bang!

An explosion resounded abruptly, and then a figure was blasted away!

It was the Nether Lord!

Suddenly, Yang Ye appeared before him, and then a blood red sword descended.

Countless strands of Death Energy and Yin Energy swept out of the Nether Lord, but they couldn’t stop Yang Ye’s sword!

Dual Domains and dual intents!

Hiss!

The sword tore through the Death Energy and Yin Energy!

The Nether Lord was shocked. He forcefully moved away at the critical moment, but it was still a little too late.

The sword descended, and half his body was sliced off!

But that wasn’t the end of it! A ray of sword energy flashed!

The Nether Lord’s body stiffened on the spot.

There was a blood red sword in his chest!

Yang Ye stood behind the Nether Lord as he placed his right hand on the latter’s head, and then he drew his sword with his left hand and slowly cut through the Nether Lord’s throat…

Blood sprayed!
