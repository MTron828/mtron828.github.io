Chapter 1784 – Seizing Control!

Yang Ye slowly clenched his right hand.

A trap!

At this moment, how could he not realize that the Secret Sect had schemed against him? They hadn’t brought him here to help seal the head; they’d joined forces with the head and schemed against him.

Suddenly, a head appeared not too far away from Yang Ye. The head had no hair, and there was a black ball of light on top of it. Besides that, two finger-thick chains were coiled around it on both sides, and they chained it tightly.

The head gazed at Yang Ye with a burning gaze, and it was like a virgin looking at a completely naked beauty. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Suddenly, Su Mu appeared not too far away from Yang Ye.

Yang Ye gazed at Su Mu, “Sect Master Su, at least let avoid dying an ignorant death!”

Su Mu fell silent for a moment, and then he gazed at the head, “He’s going to escape anyway. Even the wooden sword can’t stop him anymore.”

Yang Ye asked, “So?”

Su Mu continued, “Even though he’s going to escape, if my Secret Sect converges the strength of our entire sect, we’ll be able to cripple him even if we can’t kill him. However, he doesn’t want that, and neither does my Secret Sect. So, we made an agreement. Find a vessel for him, and he’ll swear on his soul to leave the Secret Sect once he has a new vessel and never look for trouble with my Secret Sect again!”

Yang Ye said, “So you got me to do it!”

Su Mu nodded, “We were afraid you wouldn’t be up to standards, so we decided to help improve your strength. Now, it seems like he’s very satisfied.”

“I am!” The head suddenly started laughing while staring at Yang Ye without blinking, “This vessel is extremely good. His will and mind are strong. Most importantly, his attainments in the Sword Dao aren’t bad. Not bad! Not bad indeed!”

Yang Ye ignored the head and gazed at Su Mu, “Do you really believe him?”

Su Mu grinned, “My Secret Sect will naturally not place all our hopes on him. If he goes back on his word, my Secret Sect naturally has a backup plan.”

“Kid!” Suddenly, the head gazed at Su Mu, “A backup plan? If I wasn’t injured, even a hundred sects like this would be nothing before me.”

Su Mu spoke indifferently, “Unfortunately, you’re heavily injured. My ancestor thinks that it’s pointless for us to fight and kill each other. So, we’re willing to help you find a new vessel and leave. That’s a show of my Secret Sect’s sincerity and attitude towards you. What about you?”

The head gazed at Su Mu for a long time before he said, “Alright. Just as I said, if I’m able to escape, I won’t look for trouble with the Secret Sect. Don’t worry, while I’m not a good person, I disdain to lie.”

Su Mu nodded slightly and glanced at Yang Ye, “Do you need our help?”

A wisp of disdain curled up on the corners of the head’s mouth, “Wouldn’t I be an absolute weakling if I can’t even deal with an ant at the True Realm?”

Su Mu nodded slightly, “Good luck!”

He vanished on the spot once he finished speaking.

Only Yang Ye and the head remained here.

The head looked Yang Ye in the eyes, “If I were you, I won’t resist. Because it’s pointless, and it’ll be extremely painful.”

Yang Ye fell silent for a short while, and then he said, “How about we make a deal?”

The head replied, “A deal? Come, tell me about it?”

Yang Ye chuckled, “I’ll help you get out of here, and you don’t try to seize control of my body. Alright?”

“Help me?” Disdain appeared on the corners of his mouth, “You overestimate your ability. These chains and the formation here aren’t from this universe. They were brought down from the large universe by that woman from the Secret Sect. your strength is utterly incapable of breaking these chains or formation.”

Yang Ye said, “Perhaps I can try!”

“It isn’t necessary!” The head spoke indifferently, “Because even if I leave this place, I have to find a vessel. Otherwise, I wouldn’t be able to use my full strength. However, ordinary people aren’t able to endure being seized by me. But you can! So, you should understand what that means.”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and said, “Will you really not reconsider?”

“Of course!” As soon as the head finished speaking, a powerful suction force enveloped Yang Ye and sucked Yang Ye towards the head.

Yang Ye naturally wouldn’t just stand there and allow himself to be captured, so he raised his sword and swung it.

Boom!

A ray of sword energy tore through the air, and the suction force was instantly sliced apart. But it only took a moment for the suction force to reappear. After that, the suction force seemed like a myriad of iron threads that pulled on Yang Ye and slowly dragged him towards the head.

Yang Ye’s expression was calm. He held the wooden sword in his left grasp and twisted it. In an instant, a vortex of sword energy flashed out, and then the suction force was instantly sliced into bits. At the same time, Yang Ye’s figure shot backward.

“Are you trying to flee? How laughable!” The head had a wisp of ridicule on the corners of his mouth when he saw Yang Ye try to flee, and then the space around Yang Ye shrunk down in layers. The space there was like numerous pieces of thick metal that gradually pressed down upon Yang Ye.

Yang Ye raised his sword and swung it at the space that was pressing down upon him, and it was sliced open in an instant. After that, a spatial rift appeared before Yang Ye. Right when he was about to enter the spatial rift, the space before him suddenly returned to normal!

At the same time, an evil wave of energy surged out from there like an erupting volcano.

Bang!

Yang Ye was blasted backwards repeatedly, and he was pushed back to where he’d been standing a while ago.

“Your attainments in the Sword Dao aren’t bad!” Suddenly, the head spoke, “Needless to say, you’re a genius.”

Yang Ye turned around to gaze at the head and didn’t waste his breath. A moment later, a sword appeared before the head. However, as soon as it arrived before the head, a wave of powerful force slammed against Yang Ye’s sword.

Bang!

An explosion resounded, and then Yang Ye was blasted over 1km away!

“Too weak!” Meanwhile, the head said, “Even though your strength isn’t bad, it’s still weak like a child to someone like me. Even if I’m sealed right now, you’re no match for him. Stop resisting. Become my vessel. It’s an honor for you!”

A cold smile curled up on the corners of Yang Ye’s mouth, “I don’t want to just die without fighting back!”

As soon as he finished speaking, a black Sword Chest appeared in front of Yang Ye. A moment later, he shot towards the head. At the same time, six black rays of light instantly surrounded the head.

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss! Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!

A moment later, the six swords sliced the space around the head into countless pieces. However, the head was completely unharmed!

It was quite strange. Because the space where it resided had been sliced apart. But it hadn’t been harmed at all!

The head didn’t disguise his ridicule at all, “You’re wasting your energy!”

Yang Ye gazed at the head for a long time before he said, “The Enlightened Realm….”

After his sword intent attained the Enlightened Rank, he’d noticed that his sword intent didn’t exist in space anymore. It had transcended space instead. So, even if space was shattered, his sword intent wouldn’t be affected. Now, the head was in a similar state.

It was the difference between the True Realm and Enlightened Realm. They weren’t on the same level!

A moment of silence ensued, and then Yang Ye suddenly pressed his middle and index fingers together before tapping them in the head’s direction. In an instant, a ray of sword energy shot forward, but the head still had a cold and ridiculing smile on the corners of his lips. However, his expression changed when the sword energy arrived before him.

Bang!

An explosion resounded, and then the head was blasted over 30m away. But it wasn’t harmed at all!

The head gazed at Yang Ye, “Sword intent and slaughter intent at the Enlightened Rank! I underestimated you a little!”

Yang Ye didn’t say a word. He stomped his right foot down. In an instant, he transformed into a ray of light that shot towards the head.

It was a ray of light enhanced by two types of intents!

However, it had just arrived around a meter away from the head when a wave of mysterious energy slammed against it.

Boom!

The light dispersed and Yang Ye was blasted 300m away. As soon as he stopped himself, a wisp of blood seeped out from the corner of his mouth.

The head laughed coldly, “Do you have any other move? Continue!”

Yang Ye wiped off the blood on the corner of his mouth, and then he vanished on the spot. He was almost 10km away when his figure appeared again.

“You think you can run?” The head laughed coldly, and then a wave of powerful force covered the surroundings as it swept towards Yang Ye. It was very swift, and it instantly enveloped Yang Ye.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye waved his sword swiftly without end, and rays of light flashed incessantly.

In an instant, sword energy crisscrossed through the area, and space was sliced up into pieces.

Just like that, Yang Ye kept resisting.

At a secret room. There were three people in here, Lin Weiyang, Ling Xiu, and Su Mu.

A screen of light floated before them, and the scene on it was the battle between Yang Ye and the head.

Ling Xiu suddenly said, “Resistance is useless!”

Su Mu said, “If I was him, I wouldn’t just accept my fate either!”

Ling Xiu said, “Unfortunately, it won’t make a difference!”

Su Mu nodded and gazed at the screen of light.

Lin Weiyang stared at Yang Ye without blinking and remained silent.

Meanwhile, around an hour had passed in the heart of the mountain, and Yang Ye had finally stopped fighting back.

At this moment, Yang Ye was enveloped by a strand of mysterious energy, and he couldn’t move at all.

He just stared at the head with a murderous gaze!

The head slowly closed his eyes, “I can finally go in!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he transformed into a ray of black light that entered Yang Ye’s forehead.

At the same time, an imperceptible arc formed on the corners of Yang Ye’s mouth.
