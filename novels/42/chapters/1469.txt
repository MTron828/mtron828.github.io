Chapter 1470 – Sword! Sword!

Who was the person before him?

It was that masked saber wielding woman that Yang Ye had met at the entrance of Ominous City. At that time, she’d almost killed him in an instant. So, she’d left a rather deep impression on him.

But he hadn’t expected to meet her here!

She’d gone deep into the Ominous Territory as well!

“It’s you!” There was a trace of surprise in her eyes. Obviously, she too hadn’t expected to meet Yang Ye here.

Yang Ye asked, “What are you doing here?”

She replied with a question, “What are you doing here?”

Yang Ye replied, “I came to look for something.”

She replied, “I came to look for inheritances!”

Yang Ye glanced at her. Needless to say, he’d underestimated her strength. After all, she was clearly not ordinary since she could get here on her own!

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts and asked, “I saw you running over from that direction. There were also numerous demon beasts coming from there. Did something happen there?”

She shook her head slightly, “I don’t really know. Because I didn’t go deep, nor am I able to do so. There are too many demon beasts there. It’s very easy to be discovered!”

When she spoke up to this point, she gazed at Yang Ye and said, “Your skill in concealment is extremely formidable. Even I almost failed to discover your presence.”

Yang Ye asked, “Then how did you?” He was quite curious about how she’d discovered his presence.

However, she shook her head, “I can’t tell you.”

Yang Ye shrugged, “One more question. Is this the Forest of Darkness?”

“I don’t know!” She continued, “Even though I’ve entered the Ominous Territory in the past, I’ve never gone deep. This is my first time coming here, and it may be my last. It’s too dangerous here. Based on your current strength, if you insist on going further, then it’s very likely that you won’t be able to come back.”

She gazed at Yang Ye and continued, “I was only able to get here due to certain reasons. But I never expected that you would be able to get here. Looks like you’re much stronger than I expected. Let’s fight if we have the chance in the future!”

Yang Ye replied, “We can spar if we have the chance!” Yang Ye was very willing to spar with experts. Because he would be able to determine what he lacked and improve himself. This woman before him was the strongest saber cultivator he’d met. Her saber was too sharp and swift!

Especially its speed. Even he feared it!

She nodded slightly, “If you intend to go further, then let me give you a piece of advice. Don’t. Even though I don’t know what those demon beasts fear so strongly to the point of leaving their territory, I have no doubt that it is absolutely not something you or I can fight right now!”

Yang Ye smiled, “I appreciate your good intentions, but I’m still going to continue forward.”

She glanced at him and nodded slightly, “Good luck!”

Yang Ye asked, “Are you leaving right now?”

She shook her head, “I’m going to look around. This place is extremely dangerous, but it’s filled with fortune as well. So, I’ve decided to look around. Unless I encounter an extraordinarily powerful demon beast, ordinary demon beasts can’t keep up with my speed.”

“Right!” Yang Ye nodded. She was absolutely swift. It could be said that he couldn’t compete with her speed at all. Now, he understood why she was able to get here. Besides her formidable strength, the other factor that supported her success was her speed!

If she decided to flee, then perhaps only Qiong Qi could catch up to her!

Meanwhile, she said, “I have other business to attend to, so I’ll be bidding farewell now.”

Yang Ye nodded, “Farewell!”

She nodded slightly, and then she vanished on the spot. She was 30km away when her figure appeared once more. She was so swift that her figure couldn’t be seen clearly. Even Yang Ye couldn’t!

Yang Ye gazed at the direction she vanished towards, and a long time passed before he shook his head, “Looks like I have to work on my speed.” Speed was definitely beneficial.

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts. He was about to continue forward before he suddenly closed his eyes, and then his clone appeared in the Primordial Pagoda.

Yang Ye’s clone arrived before the demon beast that was still being suppressed by the Primordial Pagoda. At this moment, there was another figure by its side, and it was Little Sky, of course.

A ferocious glow instantly appeared in the heavily injured demon beast’s eyes when it saw Yang Ye. However, it didn’t take long for the ferocity to vanish and be replaced by fear.

Yang Ye paid no attention to it and gazed at Little Sky instead. Because it was Little Sky who’d asked him to come here.

She walked over to him and spoke softly, “Can you stop bullying them? They are quite pitiful....”

Yang Ye glanced at her and said, “Little Sky, tell me the truth. Are you a demon beast?” Actually, he’d had such suspicions from the beginning. Because all the demon beasts gave her face. Moreover, she was really protective of them. So, he suspected that she was a demon beast!

Little Sky shook her head, “I don’t know what race I’m from.”

Yang Ye felt speechless.

Meanwhile, Little Sky walked over to the demon beast and patted it lightly on the head, “It’s fine. Just stay with him for five years. Once five years have passed, you’ll regain your freedom. Moreover, even though he’s cursed by the heavens, he possesses great karmic luck. Staying with him might bring fortune to you.”

The demon beast glanced at Yang Ye, glanced at Little Sky, and then didn’t hesitate to nod and display its agreement.

Yang Ye couldn’t help but take a deep and long glance at Little Sky. They really do give her so much face.

At this moment, Yang Ye wanted to drag Qiong Qi in here and see if Qiong Qi would give her face! Unfortunately, Qiong Qi was absorbing the energy from the demonic dragon and couldn’t show himself for now.

Just like that, the demon beast submitted to Yang Ye with Little Sky’s help. Even though it was just for five years, as far as Yang Ye was concerned, it was enough.

Because the demon beast had the head of a cow and the body of a person, Yang Ye gave it a name which he felt really suited the demon beast — Little Cow!

With Little Cow addition to the group, Yang Ye had a total of six demon beasts if Qiong Qi was included!

If he was included in the group, then their forces could even go against 30 Deities! Because both Little Cow and the Ancient Emperor Python could fight three Deities on their own. As for Qiong Qi, it was obvious that he could fight more. Based on Qiong Qi’s current strength, even fighting five Deities wouldn’t be a problem for him.

It could be said that he’d gained greatly on his trip to the Ominous Territory. Of course, it would be perfect if he could obtain the Spring of Life. If he failed, then it was very likely that everything he gained would be useless!

If he was dead, then what was the point of the treasures and demon beasts he’d gathered?

The Spring of Life!

Yang Ye opened his eyes, took a deep breath, and continued forward.

All along the way, there were more demon beasts running out from deep within the forest.

Yang Ye was extremely shocked by the sight of them. Because Deities really were everywhere. It could be said that if the people and demon beasts here could leave, then even the joint forces of the entire lower dimensions would definitely be unable to resist them. Because up until now, practically every single demon beast he’d encountered was one that had attained its strength through hard work and without relying on any external forces.

Based on his estimations, perhaps only the large world could fight against the Ominous Territory.

Even though the Ominous Territory was very terrifying and even had that unknown area beyond Yellow Springs River, the large world couldn’t be underestimated! After all, Nether Maiden and the others were from there!

Moreover, he hadn’t met the Nether Pavilion’s eldest sister and second sister. However, their strengths were definitely capable of destroying worlds. But there were powers on par with the Nether Pavilion within the large world. Besides that, how extraordinary was Jian Wuji? However, he wasn’t unmatched in the large world. He could only be considered to be the strongest sword cultivator in his generation.

It was obvious how powerful the powers of the large world were.

However, the Ominous Territory wasn’t ordinary as well. So, it was impossible to know if the Ominous Territory or the large world was stronger. After all, they hadn’t collided!

As Yang Ye traveled deeper into the forest, fewer and fewer demon beasts were running in his direction. In the end, he only saw a few demon beasts every hour. Yang Ye’s gaze burned with desire when he saw them. Because if he could send them into the Primordial Pagoda, then he could form an army of demon beasts!

However, he didn’t dare to do that!

If he created a huge commotion here, then he might be besieged!

After continuing forward for another two hours, Yang Ye didn’t see another demon beast. He couldn’t help but reveal a solemn expression at this point. He slowed down and remained vigilant at all times.

He had a bad feeling!

At this point, the bad feeling he had was growing strong and stronger!

Suddenly, Yang Ye stopped and listened attentively.

Thump! Thump!

Soft thumps were coming from far away. It sounded like footsteps. They started soft, but they gradually grew louder. Moreover, Yang Ye noticed that the ground had started to tremble slightly.

It didn’t take long for it to grow much louder. Around 10 breaths of time later, the entire ground was shaking violently. Moreover, even the trees in the surroundings were shaking intensely. Countless leaves were raining down from them. At the same time, the soft thumping reverberated like thunderclaps. Every single one was deafening!

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly while an extremely solemn expression appeared on his face. What exactly is over there?

Yang Ye remained silent for a moment, and then he had the intention to retreat. His intuition told him that regardless of what was far ahead in the distance, it was definitely not something he could deal with.

So, he should avoid it for now!

Right when Yang Ye was about to retreat, a hoarse voice came from afar, “Sword... sword... sword....”

Sword? Yang Ye was stunned. What?

Suddenly, Yang Ye looked ahead. He seemed to have seen something, and it caused his eyes to open wide, “Don’t scare me like that....”
