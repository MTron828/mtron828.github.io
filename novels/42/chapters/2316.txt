Chapter 2317 – Go On! Continue!

Not steal, take!

Take!

Wang Yun’s face was quite unsightly.

The other experts here had quite strange expressions on their faces. According to what the Immortal Estate had told others, their treasure had been stolen. But now it seemed like it hadn’t been stolen, someone had just walked in and taken it!

It was a completely different thing!

The experts of the other clans had slight vigilance in their eyes as they gazed at the middle aged man in cloud white robes.

Since he had been able to enter the Immortal Estate, take something, and leave safely, it was obvious that he was no ordinary expert!

He was extraordinary!

The middle aged man walked slowly to the door of light that led to the Eternal Secret Realm. Meanwhile, Wang Yun obstructed his path.

The middle aged man stopped and looked up at Wang Yun, “Hmm?”

Wang Yun spoke indifferently, “Please wait here for a moment!”

The middle aged man shook his head slightly, “No!”

Wang Yun’s eyes narrowed slightly, “What if I insist?”

The middle aged man vanished on the spot.

A ray of light flashed!

The middle aged man had already entered the Eternal Secret Realm.

Everyone here gazed at Wang Yun with shock, and a moment of silence ensued before a gust of wind blew by.

Crack!

Wang Yun’s head fell off his neck.

Blood sprayed like a fountain!

Everyone here was stunned by this scene.

Dead!

A True Void Realm expert had died just like that! Moreover, none of them had been able to discern how Wang Yun had died.

Shock!

All of them broke out in cold sweat. Wang Yun was a True Void Realm expert. How strong was he? Even True World Realm experts couldn’t kill him without making a sound! However, that sword cultivator had killed him in an instant with such ease!

That was absolutely horrifying strength!

Suddenly, a white haired old man appeared before Wang Yun’s corpse, and there was a small ‘仙’ character embroidered before his chest. Obviously, he was from the Immortal Estate!

The old man glanced at Wang Yun’s neck, and then a solemn expression gradually appeared on his face. It didn’t take long for another middle aged man in a luxurious robe to appear behind him.

The middle aged man spoke solemnly, “Elder Ling, do you know who he is?”

The white haired old man shook his head slightly, “Give the order to stop looking for him.”

“What?!” The middle aged man frowned, “Elder Ling, he took… He stole that thing. It’s of the utmost importance to our Immortal Estate, we can’t…”

Elder Ling suddenly interrupted him and asked, “Is your life more important or that thing?”

The middle aged man replied solemnly, “Is he so strong that even you aren’t confident in being able to defeat him?”

Elder Ling glanced at the middle aged man and replied, “Wang Yanxian, open your eyes and take a proper look. He used just one attack to instantly kill Wang Yun who’s in the same realm of cultivation as you. I may be at the True World Realm, but I know I can’t kill a True Void Realm expert in an instant. But he accomplished that with ease! His strength far surpasses any of our expectations.”

Wang Yanxian fell silent.

Elder Ling continued, “Stay here and wait for Yang Ye. He must not be allowed to live. I’m heading back to see the Estate Master and see what he decides!”

He vanished on the spot once he finished speaking.

Wang Yanxian’s face fell, and no one knew what he was thinking. A long time passed before he gazed at the patriarch of the Hanyuan Clan, Hanyuan Lin, “Patriarch Hanyuan, has there been any movement?”

Hanyuan Lin shook his head slightly, “None at all. However, I think they should be coming out soon. The Eternal Secret Realm automatically vanishes after some time, and it’s about time now!”

Wang Yanxian nodded slightly, “Good.”

He gazed at the headless corpse on the ground. Wang Yun was from his clan! Wang Yun was his own cousin brother, and they had a good relationship since they were young.

He fell silent for a short while, and then he gazed at the entrance to the secret realm, “Yang Ye, if it wasn’t for you, he wouldn’t have died. I’m going to crush you when you come outside!”

Hanyuan Lin glanced at Wang Yanxian, and slight disdain arose in his heart. Wang Yanxian didn’t dare to seek out the middle aged sword cultivator and blamed Yang Ye for it instead. Needless to say, it was quite embarrassing.

…

Eternal Village.

High above in the sky, a huge ray of saber energy descended, and it seemed like it was about to slash the world apart.

A black shadow was beneath it.

It was Nine Hells Emperor.

Hand over Yang Ye!

Nine Hells Emperor wanted Eternal Village to hand over Yang Ye. However, he’d underestimated Yang Ye’s status in their hearts. Especially Wang Erya’s grandfather. As far as the sly old man was concerned, it would end with Yang Ye’s death if Yang Ye died in the rear mountains, but Yang Ye hadn’t. Since Yang Ye hadn’t died there, it was the heavens that wished for Yang Ye to survive.

Yang Ye was worth the fight!

So, all four of them had decisively chosen to fight.

The saber energy in the sky had just descended upon the black shadow’s head when a hideous claw suddenly slapped against it.

The saber energy shook violently, and then the claw crushed down on it.

Bang!

The saber energy exploded apart, and a wave of powerful energy rippled out through the entire sky. Suddenly, a spear shot up into the air like a rising dragon.

The slovenly old man was behind the spear. At this moment, the old man didn’t seem slovenly at all, and his entire body emanated an overbearing aura!

In the sky, Nine Hells Emperor grunted coldly, and then he transformed into an afterimage that slammed down at the spear. In an instant, a foot of a beast stomped down against it.

Bang!

The sky shook violently, and then a figure crashed down.

Boom!

The entire ground collapsed abruptly. However, when the collapsing ground extended to Eternal Village, a strand of powerful and mysterious energy isolated the aftershock and kept the village safe!

On the ground, the slovenly old man suddenly appeared beside Auntie Vege, and then he looked up at Nine Hells Emperor, “Big Sis, it’s your turn!”

Auntie Vege glanced at the Wang Erya’s grandfather, “Are you going first? Or shall I?”

Suddenly, Yang Ye stepped forward to display that he would go first!

But it didn’t take long for a hand to grab him and toss him to Bai Zhixian. It had been Auntie Vege who did that. She glanced indifferently at Yang Ye and said, “Just stand there.”

Yang Ye waved his sword, and Bai Zhixian hurriedly grabbed his hand.

Even Yang Ye would be of no help in a battle at this level. Nine Hells Emperor was from the Primal Era! Moreover, he was at least above the True World Realm. But what about Yang Ye? Yang Ye was just at the Progenitor Realm!

However, Bai Zhixian still failed to stop him. A ray of light surged up into the air and slashed at Nine Hells Emperor.

Nine Hells Emperor grunted coldly, and then a wave of powerful pressure rippled down.

Bang!

Yang Ye’s sword energy was instantly blasted apart, and then a figure crashed down from the sky. It slammed into the ground not too far away from Bai Zhixian.

A deep hole had been smashed open in the ground!

It didn’t take long for Yang Ye to crawl out of it. Meanwhile, Auntie Vege said, “Go on! Continue!”

Yang Ye walked slowly over to Bai Zhixian, and then he sat down cross-legged and started recuperating.

He didn’t want to fight anymore!

Bai Zhixian felt speechless.

Auntie Vege glanced at Yang Ye, and then she gazed at Wang Erya’s grandfather, “Are you going first? Or shall I?”

The old man grinned, “Then I’ll do it!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he suddenly gestured with both hands, and then thin threads of blood appeared in the sky. These threads of blood covered the entire sky like a web of blood!

“Divine Shaman Techniques!” Nine Hells Emperor spoke coldly in the sky, “You really hid your strength well.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he suddenly waved his hands, and then two towering claws appeared in the sky and swept through it. It was like the sky would be swept apart by it.

However, the red threads weren’t broken by it, and they rapidly condensed. In just an instant, Nine Hells Emperor’s entire body was bound tightly by them.

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!

Just a moment later, fine blood red marks appeared throughout his body. However, a powerful aura swept out from him at this moment.

Boom!

Along with the aura, the blood red threads around him were instantly obliterated. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

The aura was like a torrent that slammed down from the sky.

“Titan Demon Bloodline!” Wang Erya’s grandfather spoke softly, “70% purity! How rare!”

Auntie Vege nodded slightly by his side, “I never expected him to be at this level.”

As soon as she finished speaking, she flipped her palm upward and raised it swiftly.

Bang!

A huge ethereal palm ascended to the sky.

It seemed like it could overturn the world!

Bang!

A rumbling explosion resounded, and then the aura was instantly blasted apart, but Auntie Vege’s attack had vanished without a trace too.

“Using numbers against me?” Nine Hells Emperor grunted coldly, “Can you compete with the number of demons in the rear mountains?”

As soon as he finished speaking, a loud and ferocious roar resounded and surged toward the rear mountains.

AN instant later, the entire area started quaking, and then countless Primal Demons rushed out from the rear mountains!

Auntie Vege and the others’ expressions instantly turned unsightly from the sight of this!

If they joined forces, they didn’t have to fear Nine Hells Emperor! However, if all the demons in the rear mountains attacked, then it would be absolutely not something they could resist. Even that person hiding in the shadows wouldn’t dare to underestimate their strength!

Countless demons were dashing like a surging wave toward Eternal Village.

At this moment, the ground throughout the Eternal Secret Realm was quaking.

Suddenly, a middle aged man in cloud white robes and a sword in his grasp appeared at the entrance to Eternal Village!
