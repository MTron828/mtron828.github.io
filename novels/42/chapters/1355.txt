Chapter 1356 – The Sword Domain!

It was a rag that was floating before him. He’d seen this rag because it was the exact same one that had been on Blind Maiden’s stomach when he met her for the first time. However, he’d thought that it was there to patch her clothes. But it was obviously not a patch, or Blind Maiden wouldn’t have given it to him.

Yang Ye gazed at it for a short while, and then he flicked a strand of sword intent into it.

Bang!

The rag instantly emanated a strand of dazzling light, and then a crystal blue diagram appeared before Yang Ye. The diagram was around one meter long and half a meter wide. But the diagram was empty. There was nothing on it.

The Stellar Sword Diagram!

Yang Ye pondered deeply for a long time before he placed his right hand on the diagram, and then the sword intent within him surged out madly.

After his sword intent surged into it, the entire diagram started to tremble violently. In the blind of an eye, it vanished, and the scene around Yang Ye changed at the exact same instant that it vanished.

The starry sky!

At this moment, Yang Ye was amidst the stars. Countless stars were above and all around him.

Meanwhile, the Sword Spirit appeared by his side.

She spoke solemnly, “This is a real world!”

Yang Ye nodded. As soon as his sword intent surged into the Stellar Sword Diagram, it brought him up into the starry sky. In other words, he wasn’t in an illusory realm, and he was in a real world.

The Sword Spirit suddenly said, “These aren’t real stars!”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “What do you mean?”

The Sword Spirit replied, “A star might be billions of kilometers away from us, yet see how they are so close, extremely close.” She paused for a moment and continued, “If I’m not wrong, this is definitely a projection of an area in space within our universe that Jian Wuji created.”

Yang Ye felt even more puzzled, “A projection of space?”

The Sword Spirit nodded, “He utilized his extraordinary ability to create a projection of the stars in space within the Stellar Sword Diagram. Simply speaking, the Stellar Sword Diagram is a miniature of space in this universe. As for the stars within the diagram, they are definitely linked to the real stars in our universe. So, when you activate this diagram, you’ll be able to draw upon the energy within those stars.”

Yang Ye gained a rough understanding when she explained it in that way. The Stellar Sword Diagram was something Jian Wuji had created based on the universe, and he’d modelled it after the starry sky in this universe. However, the stars within the Stellar Sword Diagram weren’t independent, and they were linked to the stars in this universe.

So, when he activated the stars within it, he could use them as a medium to utilize the energy of those real stars in the depths of the universe!

It could be said that he was actually in an illusory world. Because these stars around him weren’t real stars, and they were projections of the stars in this universe.

Yang Ye asked, “How do I draw upon the energy of these stars?”

The Sword Spirit replied, “Try using your sword intent!”

Yang Ye nodded, and then Rebirth Rank sword intent appeared out of thin air around him. In an instant, it enveloped all the stars here. Once his sword intent appeared here, the stars immediately started emanating faint light. This light wasn’t starlight, but the glow of sword energy. However, besides that, there were no further changes.

Yang Ye gazed at the Sword Spirit, “What’s going on?”

She glanced at the surroundings, and then gazed at Yang Ye, “Try activating the Sword Domain!”

Yang Ye nodded and took a step forward. In an instant, the entire expanse of space here was enveloped by his Sword Domain, and then the stars instantly started to tremble lightly. At the same time, Yang Ye’s expression instantly changed.

He was shocked!

Why?

He ruled everything within the Sword Domain, and he could control everything and become one with everything within the Sword Domain. At the moment he activated the Sword Domain, he’d sensed countless stars. It was quite inconceivable, but he really did sense them!

Countless stars!

Yang Ye wasn’t just able to sense every single star here, he could sense the actual stars they were linked to. In other words, he could sense the stars throughout Dark Hell Stellar Region via the Stellar Sword Diagram. Not only was he able to sense them, he could even sense that he’d formed a slight connection with them!

“I understand why the Stellar Sword Diagram needs the Sword Domain to be utilized!” Meanwhile, the Sword Spirit said, “Jian Wuji created it from observing the universe. If I’m not wrong, he used the Sword Domain when he was creating it. Only by utilizing the Sword Domain could he sense these stars clearly and create the Stellar Sword Diagram. Once it is utilized, the person utilizing it must sense those stars and form a link with them, and only by possessing the Sword Domain will that be possible.... Moreover, only the Sword Domain can accomplish that!”

Yang Ye asked, “How do I utilize the Stellar Sword Diagram?”

The Sword Spirit glanced at the surroundings and said, “You lack a sword!”

As soon as she finished speaking, she transformed into a sword that appeared in the distance, and then the stars in the surroundings started to tremble violently.

Meanwhile, the Sword Spirit said, “Use them as your medium to utilize the energy of the stars in this stellar region, and then release Stellar Sword Energy!”

Yang Ye asked, “Is that possible?”

“Of course!” The Sword Spirit replied, “These stars contain stellar energy. Now, you have to use the stars in the Stellar Sword Diagram as your medium to utilize the stars in this stellar region and transform their stellar energy into sword energy!”

“Let me try!” As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye closed his eyes.

Om! Om! Om!

Quite some time passed before countless sword howls resounded throughout Dark Hell Stellar Region. After that, countless stars in the starry sky above Dark Hell Stellar Region emanated strands of stellar sword energy. The stellar sword energy were like shooting stars that descended successively towards Dark Hell Continent.

At this moment, practically everyone throughout the continent was looking up, and their eyes were filled with shock, disbelief, and terror.

Is the end of the world upon us?

That was what everyone thought right now.

Because their fields of vision were filled with a dense expanse of stellar sword energy that was descending towards them!

The entire sky was densely packed with stellar sword energy!

It was absolutely terrifying!

But it didn’t take long for the sword energy to vanish abruptly. Countless people heaved sighs of relief at the sight of this.

Meanwhile, in the Stellar Sword Diagram, Yang Ye was covered in sweat. His eyes were filled with threads of blood, and his face was pale as a sheet. Moreover, if one looked carefully, one would notice that there were some strands of white hair on his head. Especially, the hair at the sides of his head, they were especially striking and practically completely snow white.

The Sword Spirit asked, “Are you alright?”

Yang Ye took a deep breath and laughed bitterly, “I almost killed myself.”

He’d succeeded at creating stellar sword energy, but he’d paid a price for that. That price was quite terrifying because he’d lost almost 3,000 years of his lifespan!

3,000 years!

After all, the lifespan of an Emperor was usually around 10,000 years. In other words, he’d lost 30% of it in just that short moment. Fortunately, he’d stopped in time. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have lost just 3,000 years, he might have been completely crippled instead.

“I was careless!” Meanwhile, the Sword Spirit spoke solemnly, “Based on your current strength, your Sword Domain can’t endure so much stellar energy at all.”

Yang Ye nodded. How much stellar energy was there throughout Dark Hell Stellar Region? Such a tremendous amount of stellar energy wasn’t something he could endure right now. Actually, he was lucky that he was an Emperor now. If he was still a Quasi Emperor, then it was obvious that he would have died in just a moment.

It wasn’t too bad now. If he went all out, then it would be entirely possible to activate the stellar sword formation once. However, the price was quite huge, and it was much greater than the ignition of his intent or soul!

After all, those merely made him lose a realm of cultivation or a rank of sword intent, but this would take his life! Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

The Sword Spirit said, “It’s best to avoid utilizing it if you can!”

Yang Ye laughed bitterly, “Of course!” Actually, the stellar sword formation was extremely terrifying. It could be said that if he utilized it against Jian Xu, then Jian Xu would definitely be obliterated into bits! Not to mention Jian Xu, it was even possible for him to destroy the entire continent!

If the sword energy from before had descended upon Dark Hell Continent, then even if it wasn’t completely destroyed, at least over 90% of the living beings on the continent would have been annihilated!

Countless strands of stellar sword energy.... Even he didn’t know how many there were!

“Right!” Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly said, “Wouldn’t it be useless after I leave this stellar region?”

“Of course it wouldn’t!” The Sword Spirit said, “Its ability is to copy the stars in the region it’s in. Thus, so long as stars are present, it can be activated.”

Yang Ye smiled, “Good!”

The Sword Spirit asked, “Do you know one of the Sword Domain’s abilities now?”

Yang Ye remained silent for a while before he nodded, “Actually, I’ve grasped some abilities of the Sword Domain for a long time now.”

What could the Sword Domain accomplish?

It could suppress sword intent that was stronger than his own, suppress all Laws, replicate some Laws, conceal his aura, allow him to cultivate sword techniques quickly.... Now, he’d learned another ability of the Sword Domain. It was the ability to sense bodies of energy, and he could use them as a medium to summon sword energy!

For example, if he had violet crystals around him now, then he just had to activate the Sword Domain, sense the violet crystals, and build a link between him and them. After that, he could just utilize the energy within them to form sword energy to attack his enemies.

Jian Wuji had utilized that exact same principle to create the Stellar Sword Diagram. However, he knew that his Sword Domain couldn’t cover all the stars in a stellar region. So, he’d created the Stellar Sword Diagram, and he utilized it as a medium to sense the actual stars in the stellar region.

He used a small copy to sense the enormous region they represented!

Needless to say, Jian Wuji was a genius.

Meanwhile, the Sword Spirit asked, “Now do you know why the Sword Domain is terrifying?”

Yang Ye nodded. He naturally knew why.

When the day came that his Sword Domain could cover an entire stellar region, then all bodies of energy within the stellar region could be utilized to form sword energy!

If his Sword Domain could cover an entire universe....
