Chapter 2411 – Executor!

He didn’t want it anymore!

Yang Ye wasn’t giving up, but he really didn’t have the strength to fight for it. The sword may be good, but staying alive was better!

He would never exchange his life for a sword.

If there was even the slightest chance, then Yang Ye would definitely not give up. But there wasn’t.

12!

12 sword cultivators, yet he’d almost lost his life just fighting the third. So, how would he fight the rest?

It was impossible!

Yang Ye laid there on the ground while his body twitched from time to time, and blood was ceaselessly flowing out from behind him.

If it wasn’t for the Primordial Violet Energy within him, he would have died from these injuries.

As soon as he spoke those words, the black robed sword cultivator turned ethereal, and then the figure vanished on the spot.

Suddenly, a voice resounded in Yang Ye’s head, “You did much better than I expected!”

Yang Ye opened his eyes, and a familiar figure was standing above him.

It was a man, a man without arms, legs, or eyes. It was the same mysterious man from beneath the Northern Sword Sect.Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

The man grinned, “I’m quite proud of you. Because you didn’t choose to use those Divine Treasures of yours. You can use them, but you must know what is more important. You did well in that aspect.”

Yang Ye laughed bitterly, “They were too strong!”

“Of course!” The man smiled, “All of them were extraordinary geniuses who represented the times they lived in. So, it’s very extraordinary for you to be able to surmount your realm of cultivation in battle against them.”

Yang Ye laughed bitterly, “Is this a test?”

The man shook his head slightly, “No, you passed my test at the Northern Sword Sect. I was merely using them to find out how much of the sword I should unseal for you. Its true strength isn’t something that you can control right now. If it falls into your hands, then just a ray of sword energy from it is enough to annihilate you.”

Yang Ye shook his head and laughed bitterly, “Am I still so weak?”

The man smiled, “Not at all. It’s that we are already at the peak of the world, and there’s quite a distance between you and us.”

Yang Ye gazed at him, “Senior, are you dead?”

The man nodded, “Yes!”

Yang Ye asked, “How?”

Yang Ye was puzzled. Because Martial Ancestor, Wu Ni, and this man were very, very terrifying existences, yet all of them were dead.

Who killed them?

The man smiled, “You’ll find out in the future.”

Yang Ye laughed bitterly.

The man continued, “If you use everything you have, killing a Three World Realm expert isn’t difficult for you, but if you encounter a Four World Realm expert, your current strength is no match for an expert at that level.”

Yang Ye was stunned and said, “Senior, I killed him just now!”

The man shook his head, “Don’t forget that wasn’t his real body.”

Yang Ye was speechless.

The man added, “If his real body was here, you wouldn’t have lasted 100 moves.”

Not even 100 moves!

It was quite a blow to Yang Ye’s confidence.

“20%!” Meanwhile, the man said, “Based on your current strength, I can only unseal 20% of its strength for you. 20% is enough for you.”

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and said, “Senior, how about unsealing a little more?”

The man chuckled, “If I do that, you’ll suffer backlash from it. Besides that, don’t underestimate that 20%. It will at least improve your strength by 50%. In other words, if you use that sword, you can fight a Four World Realm expert who relied on nothing more than his own efforts to attain such a realm of cultivation. As for whether you win or lose, it depends on how strong that person is.”

The man flicked a sword over to Yang Ye while he spoke.

The sword was over 1m long, completely translucent like it was made of glass, but its blade had a very striking wisp of blood red.

It was blood!

Besides that, its tip was chipped off at the side.

The man said, “Very few have ever seen this sword for themselves, and the portraits of it in the outside world were merely drawn based on the imagination of people. Of course, there is something true about them, and it’s that this sword really has a chipped tip!”

Yang Ye asked, “Is it because destiny feared it and removed a part of its tip?”

The man shook his head and smiled, “You believe what people say?”

Yang Ye asked, “Then why?” He was quite curious about why the sword’s tip was chipped.

The man grinned, “Its tip is chipped because it did it to itself.” He gazed at the sword with a wisp of complicated emotions in his eyes, “An edge with no end, that is its Dao!”

Its own Dao!

Yang Ye was stunned, and then he couldn’t help but ask, “A sword can have its own Dao?”

The man nodded, “Everything in this world has its own Dao. This sword’s Dao is an edge with no end. It means exactly that, its edge is without an end. That’s why it became the number one sword of the Eternal Universe all those years ago. It attained the Dao and rose to prominence!”

Yang Ye gazed at the sword, hesitated for a moment, and then took it in his grasp. The sword trembled slightly but didn’t resist him.

As he held it, Yang Ye had quite a strange feeling. It was like something had sealed the sword’s strength, causing it to be unable to be fully released!

Obviously, it was the man’s doing.

The man gazed at Yang Ye and nodded slightly, “As I expected, it doesn’t hate you. Remember that no matter how strong a sword is, it isn’t our own strength. Our own strength is true strength. If you aren’t strong, even the best treasure would be meaningless. You can use external sources of strength, but you must remember that you are most important. You must always carefully remember what is primary and what is secondary.”

Yang Ye cupped his fist to the man and said, “Thank you for your guidance!”

He hesitated for a moment and asked, “Senior, is this sword a Divine Treasure?”

The man smiled, “It’s beyond that, a Supreme Divine Treasure. There are no more than five such weapons throughout Eternal Universe, and even I have only seen three.”

Yang Ye frowned slightly, “Supreme Divine Treasure? What is the criteria to be considered that?”

“The Dao!” The man said, “If a Divine Treasure possesses its own Dao, a true Grand Dao, then it will be a Supreme Divine Treasure. At that time, it can’t be described as just a Divine Treasure. Such existences are very rare. Not to mention them, such existences are rare even among human cultivators. Transcend yourself and attain the Grand Dao.”

He gazed at Yang Ye and continued, “You are already showing signs of that!”

“Me?” Yang Ye was slightly stunned and puzzled.

The man smiled, “Your bloodline is changing, and if you’re able to transcend yourself, you’ll truly enter our circle. As far as we are concerned, people like you and the others outside are all outside our circle!”

Outside the circle!

Yang Ye laughed bitterly. Simply speaking, they were ants before these seniors!

It was like how he thought of ordinary people!

Meanwhile, the man looked up at the sky and said, “There’s not much time left. You may have things to ask, or something you’re puzzled about?”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and said, “Senior, do you have anything to tell me?”

The man glanced at Yang Ye and smiled, “Smart guy.” He glanced at the Sword Gourd on Yang Ye’s waist, and he said, “Use your flying sword to attack me.”

A sword howl resounded, and a ray of light appeared before the man’s throat.

However, it stopped just a few centimeters away from his throat and couldn’t move an inch further.

Because two fingers had clamped down on it!

Yang Ye was stunned speechless.

The man used a little strength, and the sword immediately flew back to Yang Ye.

Yang Ye put it away and bowed to the man, “Please provide me with your guidance.”

The man said, “Based on your current strength and cultivation, your flying sword combined with your Sword Domain is very fast. However, it can be faster. Since you can use the strength of the Sword Domain, why can’t you use the strength of all things? Everything like the five elements, space, time, every type of matter… They can all be used.”

“The five elements? Space? Time?” Yang Ye was stunned and asked, “They can?”

The man smiled, “You should have mastered them in the past. However, when you grew stronger and gained mastery over even more powerful forms of energy, they were gradually forgotten. Actually, all of them aren’t weak, and it just depends on how you use them. Of course, there are some other energies, Laws, and techniques that are more formidable. But they aren’t things that you can master right now!”

Yang Ye nodded, “I understand!”

The man looked up again, hesitated for a moment, and said, “With that Sprite Progenitor by your side, your troubles may be endless!”

Yang Ye smiled, “It’s fine. We sword cultivators do not cause trouble, but we aren’t afraid of trouble either.”

The man roared with laughter, “Well said! Very good, very good indeed. To be honest, I really like you. This is how sword cultivators should be, breaking is better than bending, and just fight if necessary. Haha…”

As he roared with laughter, his figure gradually turned ethereal and vanished.

Only Yang Ye remained.

Once the man vanished, the surroundings became normal once more.

Deep below the ground, Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings and sat down cross-legged.

Recuperate!

His injuries were extremely serious, and even an ordinary Limitbreaker Realm expert could kill him if he went outside right now!

The sword, Executor, floated silently before Yang Ye.

…

At the top of the mountain, more and more divine senses and auras pressed down upon An Nanjing and Jian You. The auras were pressing down on An Nanjing and Jian You, but the divine senses were locked on Snowy.

As soon as Snowy appeared there, all the experts hiding in the shadows weren’t able to stay calm anymore.

The Sprite Progenitor!

That was a future Sprite Progenitor!

At the top of the mountain, Snowy gazed at the sky, blinked, and then held the mirror tightly.

Suddenly, the clouds in the sky were torn open, and then a spear shot down from above.

Its target was An Nanjing’s group!

An Nanjing’s eyes narrowed slightly. She was just about to counterattack when Snowy appeared in front of her, and she patted the mirror in her grasp to display that she would deal with the attack!

An Nanjing glanced at Snowy, and then she grabbed Snowy’s tail and tossed her aside…

Snowy’s figure flipped repeatedly in midair.

An Nanjing glanced at Snowy and said, “Be good, understand?”

Snowy was completely stunned.
