Chapter 1738 – Used Goods Are Not Refundable!

Suddenly, Yang Ye’s expression changed.

Bang!

An explosion resounded.

Yang Ye’s figure was blasted away, and he flew almost 300m before he finally stopped himself.

Meanwhile, a translucent figure had suddenly appeared where he had been standing!

A translucent figure!

Or to be more precise, it was a soul body!

Yang Ye glanced at the Blood Armor he wore. If he hadn’t immediately activated it, that attack would have heavily injured him even if he avoided death.

“A Soul Corpse!” Meanwhile, the woman in a red dress spoke abruptly, “Its strength is on par with a Blood Corpse. Of course, it’s more terrifying than a Blood Corpse. Because it’s a soul, and souls are the most mysterious. They are able to frequently catch others off guard!”

Yang Ye nodded, and then he appeared before the Soul Corpse and swung his fist.

The Soul Corpse slammed its fist at Yang Ye as well.

Boom!

A loud explosion resounded, and then Yang Ye was blasted around 30m back while the Soul Corpse was merely pushed less than 15m back!

It’s that strong? Yang Ye frowned. Even though he hadn’t used his sword, his physical strength was extremely formidable. But he hadn’t expected that his physical strength was actually unable to compete with the Soul Corpse!

Is that what a body refiner of the ancient times is like?! Yang Ye took a deep breath. He noticed that the cultivators of the ancient times were much stronger than the current cultivators in the world. Or it should be said that the knowledge from all those years ago hadn’t been passed down completely.

Meanwhile, Ku Zhuyi gazed at the woman in a red dress, “Do you have a way to deal with it?”

The woman shook her head in response and gazed at Yang Ye, “It’s time for you to display your strength.”

Yang Ye nodded, “Watch this!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he suddenly appeared beside Ku Zhuyi and the woman. After that, he gazed at Ku Zhuyi, “Grab my right hand.”

Ku Zhuyi was puzzled but still did as he’d said.

Once Ku Zhuyi grabbed his right hand, Yang Ye wrapped his left arm around the woman’s waist, and then brought them along as he vanished on the spot.

Both of them were stunned speechless by this.

The woman glanced at Yang Ye, “This is your way of dealing with it?”

Yang Ye asked, “What else?”

He refused to go head-on against that Soul Corpse. What a joke! He didn’t stand to gain anything from winning.

The woman spoke indifferently, “It’s a little different from what I imagined!”

Yang Ye didn’t know what to say in response.

Time trickled by. Around an hour later, a huge city appeared within their fields of vision.

The city was like a huge beast that was lying there on the ground, and it seemed gloomy and horrifying.

Yang Ye asked, “That’s Moment City?”

The woman nodded, “Be careful.”

“Why?” Yang Ye gazed at her, “Is it very dangerous?”

She replied, “It is. There are existences even more terrifying than Blood Corpses, Rotting Corpses, and Soul Corpses in there.”

Meanwhile, Yang Ye thought for a moment and asked, “Er, can we not go?”

She glanced at him and said, “Many treasures my father left behind are in there. There’s even one that’s extremely suitable for you.”

Yang Ye hurriedly asked, “What?”

“A Sword Chest!” The woman spoke indifferently, “The Sword Chest of an ancient sword cultivator. There are nine peak True Rank swords within it. If you’re able to control all nine of them, then coupled with the extraordinary formation within the Sword Chest, you’ll be able to fight 4th stage True Realm experts and even 5th stage True Realm experts!”

Yang Ye gazed at her for a long time before he said, “I don’t think I ever said I know how to use the sword!”

She looked him in the eye, “Even if you didn’t say anything, it doesn’t mean that I don’t know.”

Yang Ye nodded and said, “Is that Sword Chest really in there?” His ability to fight against a single opponent was formidable, but his strength wasn’t sufficient to fight a group of enemies. The Stellar Sword Diagram was an attack that struck an area, but it was quite powerless against True Realm experts.

If that Sword Chest really existed, then he was willing to take the risk!

She nodded, “It is!”

Yang Ye glanced at her, “Then let’s head in right now!”

She shook his head, “Not now.”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Why?”

She replied, “It’s still night now. It’s when those monsters in the city move about. Once dawn arrives, they’ll go back to rest. Because they aren’t fond of sunlight. So, we’ll be safer during the day!”

Yang Ye nodded, “Alright!”

As he spoke, he gazed at Ku Zhuyi and said, “Miss Ku, I think that you shouldn’t follow us there.”

“She’ll die even faster if she doesn’t stay by your side!” The woman in a red dress suddenly said, “All the beings here are beings from the ancient times, and they aren’t existences she can fight.”

Yang Ye said, “But I feel like she’ll be in even more danger if she goes with us.”

The woman replied, “Decide yourself.” She closed her eyes once she finished speaking.

Yang Ye gazed at Ku Zhuyi, “You decide!”

Ku Zhuyi fell silent for a moment before she said, “I’ll go with you!”

Yang Ye nodded, “Then come with us.” He withdrew an Energy Pearl and passed it over to her, “Recover to your peak before we go in.”

Ku Zhuyi glanced at the Energy Pearl before her and said, “Thank you!” She swallowed it once she finished speaking.

Yang Ye withdrew two more Energy Pearls and swallowed them too. His intuition told him that this trip wouldn’t be very peaceful!

The sky gradually grew bright.

Dawn.

When the first ray of sunlight descended upon the ground, the woman in a red dress opened her eyes and said, “Let’s head in!”

Just like that, they started walking towards Moment City, and it didn’t take long for them to arrive before its gates.

The woman gazed at Yang Ye.

Yang Ye shrugged, and then he placed his left hand on the city gates and pushed lightly.

Creak!

A clear creak resounded as the door was pushed open, and then a pungent smell assaulted them.

Actually, it should be described as more than one smell. There was a moldy odor, the smell of blood, and the smell of decay!

Yang Ye waved his left hand, and the smells were blasted away before they entered the city.

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings. There were very few buildings in the surroundings, and they were just scattered all over the city. Most of them were in ruins, and it was obvious they’d suffered varying degrees of damage!

The woman glanced at the surroundings and spoke softly, “This was once a very bustling city.”Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings and nodded, “I noticed!”

She spoke indifferently, “Let’s go.”

All along the way, Yang Ye and Ku Zhuyi were extremely vigilant. Even though the city was very quiet and didn’t seem dangerous at all, if they really thought like that, then they wouldn’t be too far away from death.

Time trickled by. The woman in a red dress led them to a dried up well. The well was quite large, and it covered an area of around 300m. The bottom of the well was pitch black, and they couldn’t see anything in there!

Yang Ye noticed numerous symbols all around the well.

Yang Ye remained silent for a moment and gazed at the woman, “You aren’t thinking of telling me to head down there, right?”

She nodded, “The treasure I want is down there.”

Yang Ye asked, “Is it dangerous?”

She glanced at him and asked, “What do you think?”

Yang Ye walked to the side of the well and shot a glance at its bottom. It was completely pitch black and ghastly. Even though he had the Laws of Darkness, his intuition told him that the bottom of the well wasn’t a good place, and it was very likely that he would never be able to get back up here!

Meanwhile, the woman in a red dress said, “Some of my fathers old treasures are down there, and so is that Sword Chest. There’s nothing in this world that you can get without putting some effort into things. No matter what you want, you have to pay a certain price to get it. Right?”

Yang Ye walked over to her and looked her in the eyes, “But I feel like you aren’t here just to get your father’s treasures. If I’m not wrong, you have other motives. Right?”

He'd decided to lay all the cards on the table.

Even though he was confident in his own strength, he was no fool. Moreover, overconfidence was conceit on many occasions. It was better to have less confidence in a damnable place like this.

The woman in a red dress nodded, “I do. But that’s my business.”

Yang Ye shrugged, “To be honest, I’m quite afraid of you. Because you don’t seem ordinary. Moreover, my intuition tells me that I’ll definitely die if I go down there. So….”

Yang Ye flipped his left palm and the Blood Armor appeared there. He flicked it over to her and said, “I refuse to go on with this deal.”

The reason he gave up was because the Primordial Pagoda had given him a warning!

A warning from the Primordial Pagoda!

Normally, the Primordial Pagoda would absolutely not warn him, and it only did when it was something exceptionally dangerous.

So, Yang Ye had decisively chosen to give up.

Even though the Blood Armor and potential treasures were precious, his life was more precious. If he lost his life, everything else would be worthless. Moreover, a person should know his or her own strength well. One should never underestimate oneself, but one should never overestimate oneself either. One should act according to one’s own strength!

The woman glanced at the armor before her and flicked it back to Yang Ye, “Used goods aren’t refundable!”

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly, “So you intend to force me?!”

She nodded, and then she stomped the ground lightly.

An instant later, Yang Ye and Ku Zhuyi’s expressions became extremely unsightly.

A breath of time later, Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and said, “I think going down there isn’t entirely out of the question….”
