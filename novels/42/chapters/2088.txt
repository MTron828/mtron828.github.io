Chapter 2089 – The Woman!

Yang Ye hadn’t been able to get to Sky City because he’d been stopped in the sky.

It was a woman in a white dress who’d stopped him, and it was the same woman from the god race. She kept her back to him, so he still couldn’t see her appearance.

Yang Ye looked straight at her and asked, “Why?”

She replied softly, “Do you believe in destiny?”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “What do you mean?”

She replied, “I know you’re curious about why I’m helping you. Actually, it’s very simple. It’s because you’ve helped me in the past. Due to some reasons, something happened to me, and I would have been in big trouble if it wasn’t for you. Of course, there are some other reasons. But those aren’t important.”

She paused for a moment and continued, “At that time, I planned to put an end to some of the karma between us, but I didn’t expect that…”

She didn’t continue speaking.

Suddenly, three people appeared not too far away from them, and it was the three experts from the god race.

The white robed man glanced at Yang Ye and grinned, “Take good care of Elysium! Don’t bring shame to it!”

Yang Ye spoke in a low voice, “What does the god race want from me?”

Not only had they helped him, they’d given him a top-rate weapon. As far as he was concerned, the god race wanted something from him.

The woman shook her head slightly, “You don’t have to do anything. Don’t think too much about it.”

Yang Ye fell silent.

Meanwhile, she suddenly said, ‘Be careful.”

Yang Ye looked up at her, “What do you mean?”

She replied, “There was once a Memory Seed within you. While it’s gone now, the person who put it within you is not someone a Sage can compare to. Even now, I can still sense how powerful that person is. However, what puzzles me is that someone seems to care about you, and that person is extremely strong too.”

Yang Ye spoke in a low voice, “Someone told me something similar in the past. But do you know who it is?”

She shook her head slightly, “All of what I’ve told you is the limit of my ability. Besides that, you have to be careful of the battle between the four paths. Their paths in the Dao are extremely important to those progenitors, and they will absolutely not allow their paths to be wiped out. As a successor of the Dao Path, you’ve been swept into it. It can be said that you’ll be walking on thin ice from now on!”

Yang Ye asked, “Aren’t you afraid that the four paths will act against you?”

She replied, “They have even stronger enemies to deal with. So, they don’t have the ability to deal with us. Besides that, you must take good care of that little fellow with you. Don’t let her fall into anyone’s hands. She may be your savior in the future.”

Little fellow!

Yang Ye knew that she was talking about Snowy.

She continued, “No one knows what the future holds! Take care.”

She vanished on the spot once she finished speaking.

Besides the white robed man, the other two vanished as well.

The middle aged man sized up Yang Ye and said, “You should flee immediately!”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Why?”

The man smiled, “The Strategist said that a Sage is rushing in this direction, and he’s definitely not coming for us. Obviously, he’s coming for you. Good luck, Haha!”

He vanished into the sky once he finished speaking.

A Sage!

I’ve been exposed?

Yang Ye frowned, and then his expression changed. He vanished on the spot.

Not long after he vanished, a black robed man appeared where he had been, and the black robed man glanced at the surroundings before vanishing on the spot.

Yang Ye shot through the sky on his sword.

At this moment, he was filled with questions. How did I get discovered? This doesn’t make sense! Has the Bodhi Leaf stopped working? Or perhaps they found me with some other method? Or maybe a progenitor took action?

Yang Ye didn’t dare let his mind run wild and sped up.

He had to leave the Sky Dimension as soon as possible. He was enemies with the sky race, so if they found him here, then he may not have just a single enemy.

Yang Ye was extremely fast, and it only took him a short while to leave the Sky Dimension.

Right after he left the Sky Dimension, he sensed a powerful divine sense sweep out from behind him, and it was extremely fast to the point he couldn’t avoid it and was enveloped by it.

The divine sense of a Sage!

He’d been locked onto!

Yang Ye’s face fell. Now, he couldn’t escape no matter what.

Yang Ye didn’t waste any more profound energy and just stopped. As soon as he did, a black robed man appeared before him. At the same time, an invisible barrier enveloped the surroundings and sealed off his paths of retreat.

Meanwhile, the black robed man said, “You’re difficult to find!”

Yang Ye glanced at the black robed man, “I’m a little curious. How did you find me?”

The black robed man asked, “Have you heard of the Heaven Secret Hall?”

Yang Ye shook his head.

The black robed man explained, “It’s an organization that is said to be capable of observing the secrets of the heavens. For the sake of locating you, the alliance paid a huge price, and it’s a price that even the alliance can’t pay many times. So, you must die today.”

Yang Ye shook his head, and then a sword appeared in his grasp. He smiled, “I don’t want to die yet!”

The black robed man replied, “I’m afraid that’s not up to you.”

His figure vanished on the spot and appeared in front of Yang Ye. After that, Yang Ye saw a ray of cold light flash before his eyes.

Yang Ye tilted his head to the side while flicking his sword upwards.

Bang!

Yang Ye felt a huge wave of force act upon his hand, and it blasted him away. He hadn’t even stopped himself when a huge palm suddenly emerged from the space above him, and then he clawed down at him. If it struck him, he would definitely be clawed into bits. Yang Ye didn’t dare to act carelessly. He slapped both his palms down behind him to stop himself, and then he grabbed his sword and charged upwards.

When fighting with an expert like this, he couldn’t rashly dodge unless there was no other choice. Because once he dodged, he would be completely suppressed by his enemy.

So, he chose to go head-on!

The ray of light shot up into the sky and stabbed against the huge palm. The powerful energy contained within the palm caused Yang Ye’s figure to tremble violently, and then he felt like his entire body was about to fall apart. However, the strength of his attack couldn’t be underestimated either, so it caused the palm to crack open. Meanwhile, he grabbed his sword with his other hand and twisted it with both hands.

Bang!

The huge palm exploded apart, but Yang Ye felt something flash before him.

Bam!

An instant later, Yang Ye felt a wave of powerful force slam against his chest, and then his body was blasted away. He flew over 30km away before he finally stopped himself, and a mouthful of blood sprayed from him. At the same time, threads of blood appeared all around him.

He’d suffered a direct hit just now! And it had almost blasted his body apart!

“How surprising!” The black robed man spoke abruptly, “While our investigation told us that you’re not ordinary, I’m still quite shocked. You possess such strength at the Zen Realm. To be honest, if you attain the Sage Realm, then I’m afraid there won’t be many Sages capable of being a match for you. Unfortunately, you won’t have a chance to attain the Sage Realm.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he was about to attack again, but Yang Ye suddenly took a step forward, and a wave of mysterious energy appeared here.

The Sword Domain!

As soon as the Sword Domain enveloped the surroundings, the black robed man stopped. He sized up the surroundings, “It really is the Sword Domain. You’re definitely one of the top geniuses in the human race’s younger generation, and you may be the best! Unfortunately, not a single Sage from the human race has come to your aid. Isn’t it sad?”

“What’s so sad about it?” Yang Ye laughed coldly, “People should always rely on themselves.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he raised both his hands, and then a sword appeared in each of his palms. The tips of both swords were pressed against his palm and spinning above it. At the same time, a huge ethereal sword appeared within him.

Three swords!

A moment later, Yang Ye vanished on the spot, and then three rays of light flashed within the Sword Domain!

Burial!

Yang Ye had used one of his ultimate moves. Once the three rays of light flashed, the space within the Sword Domain started to tremble.

If it wasn’t for the Sword Domain, the space here would have probably exploded apart.

For the first time, the black robed man had a solemn expression in his eyes. He took a step forward and raised his hands. In an instant, the space within Yang Ye’s Sword Domain rippled, and then waves of terrifying energy surged. In an instant, the space within Yang Ye’s Sword Domain collapsed!

Ten breaths of time later, everything returned to calm once more.

Yang Ye and the old man were still here. However, Yang Ye’s face was extremely pale, deathly pale even. He seemed extremely weak.

As for the black robed man, there was an injury on his chest!

The black robed man glanced at Yang Ye, “I didn’t expect myself to be injured by a Zen Realm expert! Amazing!”

It was clearly a very high evaluation.

Yang Ye closed his eyes.

Boom!

A moment later, a terrifying wave of pressure swept out from him, and then an ethereal dragon appeared behind him. At the same time, a weapon appeared in his grasp.

Elysium!

“You…” Suddenly, the old man spoke with astonishment, “The Sky Dragon, how could you possibly…”

Yang Ye was stunned.
