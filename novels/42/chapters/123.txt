Chapter 124 – Finally Free!

“Is there something on my face?” Yang Ye gazed at Qin Xiyue who was staring fixedly at him and asked this question. Since they left until now, Qin Xiyue had been constantly staring at him, and it slightly baffled him.

Qin Xiyue blinked, and then she said seriously, “Little Brother, actually, Big Sister really has feelings for you now!”

Earlier, Yang Ye’s resolute and ruthless actions had exceeded her expectations. He’d killed at will without the slightest hesitation, and she liked collaborating with such a person!

“Is your love so cheap?”

How could Yang Ye believe her nonsense?

Qin Xiyue smiled, and she didn’t continue on that topic. She said, “Little Brother, based on your attitude towards them from just now, even if you’re not a disciple of the Sword Sect, you ought to have some sort of relationship with it. So, why did you attack that disciple of the Sword Sect without holding back at all? Of course, Big Sister is merely curious!”

Yang Ye remained silent for a moment before he said, “I was a disciple of the Sword Sect.”

“Was? Does that mean you aren’t one now? Why?” Qin Xiyue’s eyes were filled with bewilderment.

“Because I was kicked out of the Sword Sect. That’s not right as well, to be precise, I’m not acknowledged by the Sword Sect. Understand?” Yang Ye spoke indifferently.

“How could that be possible?” Qin Xiyue opened her eyes wide and spoke with disbelief. “You’ve comprehended Sword Intent and coupled with your formidable strength, the Sword Sect’s hands would be full with roping you in and taking good care of you. How could it have kicked you out?”

“Is there any reason for me to deceive you?” said Yang Ye.

Qin Xiyue shook her head and said, “It isn’t that Big Sister doesn’t believe you. Big Sister just doesn’t understand!”

“Because I offended the Flower Palace. The Sword Sect was compelled by the pressure the Flower Palace had put upon it and decided to hand me over to be dealt with by the Flower Palace, just like what had happened earlier. Understand?” said Yang Ye in an indifferent tone. He didn’t miss the Sword Sect at all, and he only cared about Elder Qian and Su Qingshi there.

“No wonder you treated the members of the Flower Palace in that way and no wonder you didn’t hold back when attacking that Dong Wushang from the Sword Sect!” Qin Xiyue spoke in a low voice. Now, she understood why Yang Ye struck a killing blow as soon as he attacked. It turned out that there was enmity between him and both the Flower Palace and Sword Sect. At the same time, she understood why Yang Ye refused her previous invitations without the slightest hesitation.

“Please, it was they who offended me first, alright? You make it seem like I targeted the on purpose!” Yang Ye was slightly displeased.

Qin Xiyue stopped moving and said seriously, “Little Brother, tell Big Sister the truth. Are you establishing that power to deal with the Flower Palace?”

“Yes!” Yang Ye didn’t conceal it. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Qin Xiyue took a deep breath when she heard this, and a wisp of bitterness appeared on her face. She said, “Little Brother, do you know how terrifying the Flower Palace is? That’s a superpower that possesses Monarch Realm experts! Moreover, there are even countless Exalt Realm and Spirit Realm experts within it. Yet you asked Big Sister to establish a power to go against such a superpower. You really think highly of Big Sister!”

“You’re afraid?” asked Yang Ye in a flat voice.

“Could it be that I shouldn’t be afraid?” Qin Xiyue rolled her eyes and said, “Little Brother, Big Sister doesn’t know exactly what enmity there is between you and the Flower Palace, but Big Sister wants to tell you that not to mention you who have comprehended Sword Intent, even the entire Sword Sect would be unable to deal with the Flower Palace.”

“The forces of that nephew of yours is countless times stronger than your own, but would you give up on saving your mother because of that?” Yang Ye asked in a serious tone.

“Of course I won’t. But....”

Yang Ye interrupted Qin Xiyue and said, “There are no buts. There are many things in the world where we wouldn’t have a chance at all if we didn’t give it a cry, but if we did, then we would have a slight chance. Just like your Grandfather, if he didn’t launch an expedition throughout the world, then would he be able to unify the entire southern territory and establish your Grand Qin Empire?”

“Can Big Sister ask you why you want to go against the Flower Palace?” asked Qin Xiyue in a low voice.

Yang Ye was just about to speak when the violet mink who was leading the way had suddenly stopped moving. It glanced towards the surroundings before looking at the ground in the end. After that, it flashed and descended to the ground, and then it pointed at the ground while looking at Yang Ye. It seemed as if it was saying that was it was looking for was below here.

Yang Ye stomped the ground with his right foot, but the ground was hard and unlike a secret passageway. He instantly frowned and asked. “Little Fellow, are you sure the thing that’s calling you is below here?”

The violet mink nodded.

“But there’s nothing here!” said Yang Ye.

The violet mink blinked, and then it gestured towards the ground with its little claws.

Yang Ye nodded. He drew his sword and slashed it at the ground, causing sparks to shoot towards the surroundings. Yang Ye was astounded because his sword strike was actually unable to leave a mark on the ground. Even though he’d merely utilized 30% of his strength, even Dark Iron would have a mark left behind on it from a strike of his sword. Could it be that the ground here is every harder than Dark Iron?

Right when Yang Ye was about to give it another try, the ground suddenly started to warp. Yang Ye and Qin Xiyue were shocked, and they were just about to move back but it was too late. The world around them spun while their consciousness blurred.

...

After an unknown period of time, Yang Ye opened his eyes, and then he hurriedly looked towards the side. Fortunately, both the violet mink and Qin Xiyue were still here.

“Where’s this?” Yang Ye sized up the surroundings as he asked. At this moment, they were in a secret chamber. The chamber was extremely luxurious, and its walls were decorated with all sorts of strange and glowing gems.

Suddenly, Yang Ye’s pupils constricted because he actually noticed that the walls in the surroundings were densely inscribed with talisman markings!

In next to no time, Yang Ye’s gaze moved from the wall and descended to the center of the chamber. A coffin was lying there silently at the center of the chamber, and the coffin was similarly inscribed with dense talisman markings.

“This is probably one of the six main chambers.” Qin Xiyue gazed at the coffin at the center of the chamber and said in a low voice, “So it turns out that the six main chambers are concealed by Talisman Formations. No wonder the members of the six great powers and the Grand Qin Empire were unable to locate them. Who would have imagined that these six main chambers would actually be hidden under the passageways!?”

Right at this moment, the violet mink suddenly stretched out its little claw and pointed at the coffin.

Yang Ye gulped down a mouthful of saliva and asked. “You’re saying that the thing which called out to you is inside the coffin?”

The violet mink nodded.

Yang Ye and Qin Xiyue exchanged a glance, and both of their expressions turned solemn. The thing within the coffin was calling out to the little fellow, so doesn’t that mean the thing within the coffin is alive?

Right at this moment, the violet mink pointed at the coffin again before gesturing a few times with its little claw.

“You’re saying that it asked us to help it open up the coffin?” asked Yang Ye.

The violet mink nodded.

Yang Ye shot his gaze at the coffin. Only now did he realize that numerous strange talisman markings were slowly flowing through the point where the coffin’s lid and the body of the coffin were connected. Obviously, these talisman markings were utilized to suppress the mysterious living beings within the coffin. As for why it was a mysterious living being, it was because Yang Ye was unable to determine if it was human or Darkbeast....

Presently, Yang Ye was facing a problem. To open or not to open! If he did and the fellow within the coffin had ill intent, then the three of them would have really courted death. But if he didn’t open it, then he would be slightly disgruntled. After all, he’d already come here.

“Open it!” Meanwhile, Qin Xiyue said in a low voice, “No matter what’s within it, since it was capable of bringing us here, then it ought to have a way to deal with us. But since it didn’t do anything to us and is able to communicate with this mysterious little fellow without causing the little fellow to feel aversion towards it, then it represents that the thing within the coffin doesn’t have any ill intent towards us!”

“Little Fellow, does it really have no ill intent towards us?” Yang Ye asked the violet mink.

The violet mink blinked but didn’t nod nor shake its head. Obviously, this question had troubled it.

Yang Ye couldn’t help but chuckle when he saw the little fellow’s lost expression, and then he stopped worrying and hesitating before walking over to the coffin. Even if the thing within the coffin had ill intent towards them, so long as it wasn’t a Monarch Realm expert within the coffin, then he had a way to deal with it. After all, he had a few formidable Technique Talismans that his master had given him and the Pearl of Baleful Blood that could threaten the life of an Exalt Realm expert.

Yang Ye arrived before the coffin, and he gazed at the dense talisman markings that covered it. After that, he took a deep breath, stopped hesitating, and drew his sword before flicking the lid of the coffin.

Bang!

The lid was instantly flicked away, and at the same time, Yang Ye’s figure retreated back while he revealed an utterly vigilant expression.

“Oh, I’m finally free!” After less than two breaths of time, a sweet, beautiful, and breathtaking voice sounded out from within the coffin.
