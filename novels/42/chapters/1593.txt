Chapter 1594 - Worldsplitter!

Translator: InVader

Along with the voice, the space in the sky above Merak System started trembling violently. It didn’t take long for a middle aged man to appear in the sky. It was the Nether Judge. After that, the Nether Envoy, Fan Yinyu arrived there.

The one-armed man and the spear-wielding man were behind Fan Yinyu.

The space there was still trembling incessantly. Three breaths of time later, almost 100 spear-wielding black robed men had appeared behind them.

All of them were at the Rebirth Realm!

The battle hadn’t even begun, but the aura they emanated caused the space around them to ripple.

A moment later, Little Sky appeared in front of them.

Little Sky gazed coldly at them, “The heavens are benevolent. I don’t want to kill. But it doesn’t represent that I won’t kill. I’ll give you one last chance. Leave right now. Otherwise, I’ll really start killing!”

Meanwhile, Fan Yinyu suddenly spoke, “You’re the Lord of the Heaven Dao, right?”

Little Sky glanced at her and spoke coldly, “I don’t know.”

Fan Yinyu frowned slightly. She was about to speak when the Nether Judge gazed at her, “Why do you think that she’s the Lord of the Heaven Dao?”

Fan Yinyu glanced at Little Sky and replied, “Besides the Lord of the Heaven Dao, I can’t think of anyone else who can make the Eyes of the Heaven Dao obey.”

The Nether Judge asked, “Even you haven’t met the Lord of the Heaven Dao?”

Fan Yinyu shook her head, “I haven’t. However, I think that even if she isn’t the Lord of the Heaven Dao, she’s linked to the Lord of the Heaven Dao.”

The Nether Judge nodded, and then he gazed at Little Sky, “Regardless of whether you’re the Lord of the Heaven Dao or not, it isn’t important anymore. The important thing is that you can command the Eyes of the Heaven Dao. My Nether Pavilion doesn’t want to kill as well. So, how about you tell them to submit and obey my Nether Pavilion? In that way, my Nether Pavilion would have no need to use force and Merak System would be safe. Isn’t that a win-win situation?”

Little Sky gazed at the Nether Judge for a long time and said, “Is the Nether Pavilion very strong?”

The Nether Judge’s eyes narrowed slightly, “You want to find out?”

Little Sky nodded, “I really do.”

The Nether Judge nodded. A moment later, he shot towards Little Sky. Suddenly, a young boy appeared in front of Little Sky, and his expression remained unchanged as he watched the Nether Judge charge towards them. He just raised his flute, and a music note flashed forward.

Bang!

A loud explosion resounded in the sky while space in a huge area shook violently, and it seemed like the space there was about to collapse.

Around ten breaths of time later, the sky became calm once more.

At this moment, the Nether Judge was back where he had been a few moments ago, and he was staring at the young boy with a solemn expression in his eyes. As for Fan Yinyu and the others, they were extremely shocked.

Because they were very well aware of the strength that the Nether Judge possessed. He wasn’t the strongest in the Nether Pavilion, but he was definitely in the top five. Yet now, the young boy before them had actually been able to resist the Nether Judge!

Meanwhile, Little Sky suddenly said, “Little Wheel, restrain yourself. Don’t damage this world.”

The boy glanced at Little Sky and nodded slightly. After that, he stretched out his left hand, clenched it, and twisted it, “Worldsplitter!”

As soon as he finished speaking, the space around him instantly started to condense in layers. At the same time, a mysterious wave of energy appeared throughout a huge area around him.

Yang Ye instantly revealed a solemn expression when he witnessed this scene. Because he noticed that the space in the surroundings had been fortified. No, strictly speaking, the space here had been split away from Merak System.

How strong!

Yang Ye wasn’t the only one who thought in this way, the others were the same. After all, just the word terrifying wasn’t sufficient to describe strength capable of instantly fortifying and cutting away a huge area of space.

Fan Yinyu gazed at the boy for a long time and said, “I never expected that an expert like you would exist in this world.”

The boy spoke indifferently, “There’s no need to say anything. Who will fight me?”

Meanwhile, the Nether Judge stepped forward, “Come! Allow me to experience your strength!”

The boy nodded, “Then come!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he vanished on the spot. At the same time, the Nether Judge’s figure vanished on the spot as well.

It didn’t take long for explosions to rumble like thunderclaps far away in space.

Fan Yinyu gazed at Little Sky, “This world can’t resist my Nether Pavilion.”

Little Sky fell silent for a long time. Suddenly, she looked up at Fan Yinyu and the others, “All of you can dream of leaving today.”

She waved her right hand, “Qin, I’ll leave her to you.”

As soon as Little Sky finished speaking, a woman with one leg suddenly walked out slowly from the space behind Little Sky.

It was Qin.

Qin walked over to Little Sky’s side and hugged her, and then she gazed at Fan Yinyu, “Let’s fight!”

As soon as she finished speaking, Qin waved her right hand, and a pure white flower appeared on her palm. Fan Yinyu’s expression changed when she saw the flower, “A Paramita Flower! You actually possess a Paramita Flower!”

They say the Paramita Flower takes a thousand years to blood and a thousand years to wilt. The flower and its leaves never meet. But that wasn’t the main point, the main point was that even she had merely heard of it and had never seen one. The reason she’d immediately recognized it was because it was exactly like the legends described it to be. Moreover, it emanated a strong aura of death.

A wisp of surprise flashed through Qin’s eyes when she heard Fan Yinyu, “You actually recognize it! It’s very difficult to raise this flower, and I gathered the corpses, Death Energy, and Yin Energy of countless to keep it alive.”

Fan Yinyu stared at Qin, “Who are you?!”

Qin replied with a question, “Is that important?”

Fan Yinyu fell silent. At this moment, she knew that the Nether Pavilion had underestimated Little Sky. In the beginning, she’d felt that while it wouldn’t be too easy for the Nether Pavilion to conquer Merak System, it would absolutely not be very difficult. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Because she’d lived in Merak System for a very long time, and she practically knew about every expert here. But at this moment, she realized that there were many experts that she wasn’t aware of.

Where did she find all of these experts? At this moment, Fan Yinyu had the desire to retreat. She was very well aware that the Nether Pavilion had far underestimated Merak System’s strength. If they attacked by force now, they may suffer heavy losses. So, retreating and reorganizing was the best choice right now.

However, Little Sky didn’t give her the chance to do that. She immediately waved her hand and said, “Qin, beat her up! Beat her to death!”

Qin nodded. She was about to attack when Yang Ye, who'd been watching the battle until now, suddenly appeared not too far away from Fan Yinyu, “Where’s Shaoyao?!”

Before this, he’d felt that Ding Shaoyao was dead. But after he thought about it carefully, he felt that it didn’t make sense. Fan Yinyu didn’t seem like the type of person who would destroy her victim’s corpses to eliminate all traces of the deed. Moreover, Little Sky had searched that room, but she didn’t find Ding Shaoyao’s aura in there.

After all, even if the corpse was destroyed, the aura of death would linger in the area. However, the room didn’t have the aura of Ding Shaoyao’s death. In other words, it was very likely that Ding Shaoyao was alive.

Fan Yinyu gazed at Yang Ye, “She’s in a very safe place. You don’t have to worry about her.”

Yang Ye heaved a sigh of relief when he heard her. Sure enough, Ding Shaoyao was alive!

Yang Ye was about to ask where Ding Shaoyao was, but Fan Yinyu waved at him in dismissal and gazed at Qin, “Come! Let me see how strong the Paramita Flower of legend is.”

Qin nodded, “I’d like that too!”

As soon as she finished speaking, she vanished on the spot.

Fan Yinyu gazed at the spear-wielding middle aged man and said, “Don’t do anything rash!” After that, she tapped her right foot down lightly and vanished on the spot.

Once Fan Yinyu vanished, Yang Ye walked over to Little Sky, and then he glanced at the spear-wielding man’s group, “You can summon your other friends to annihilate them!”

He hadn’t forgotten that Little Sky had two more mysterious friends. If the Eyes of the Heaven Dao joined forces with those two friends of hers, and the Sprite Kings joined the battle as well, then it would really not be difficult to annihilate all these fellows.

Little Sky rolled her eyes at Yang Ye, “Silly!”

Yang Ye’s face darkened, “Why do you say that?”

Little Sky spoke softly, “If they represent the full strength of the Nether Pavilion, then I would definitely annihilate them right now. However, they aren’t. They are just a portion of the Nether Pavilion’s strength. So, I can’t expose my trump cards. Understand?”

Yang Ye nodded. Indeed. Even though the Nether Pavilion had sent so many experts, they weren’t all the experts that the Nether Pavilion had. If Little Sky exposed all her trump cards now, she would fall into a completely defensive and passive position.

Suddenly, Little Sky said, “However, we can’t let them live either!”

As she spoke, she lightly clapped her hands together.

Bang!

A loud explosion resounded through the sky, and then a huge eye appeared there. Two breaths of time later, numerous Eyes of the Heaven Dao appeared incessantly from within space. In just a short while, the entire sky was covered in them.

At this moment, the expression of the spear-wielding man had changed.

Meanwhile, Little Sky suddenly pointed at the spear-wielding man’s group, “Strike them! Strike them to death! I, Little Sky, am going to learn from the murderous madman, Yang Ye! I’m going to carry out a slaughter!”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.
