Chapter 1146 – Violet Divine Lightning!

The experts of the Lu Clan, Mu Clan, and Zhuge Clan were trapped by the barrier.

They were naturally unwilling to be trapped, and they attacked at once. However, they were horrified to notice that even their joint forces were actually unable to break through the barrier!

The Mo Clan, Thousand Crane Sect, and Law Faction had 8 Quasi Emperors, yet the Nether Pavilion only had 3 on their side. Even if Yang Ye was included, there were only 4 of them. However, the 4 of them were actually suppressing those 8 Quasi Emperors in battle! The most terrifying here were the 3 women from the Nether Pavilion. The pig-riding young woman resorted to brute force alone, and every swing of her club would injure or kill.

As for Nether Maiden and Oblivion Maiden, they were extremely terrifying as well. Their attacks were too mysterious, and it was so mysterious that even the Quasi Emperors of the Mo Clan revealed terror in their eyes.

Conversely, Yang Ye seemed quite ordinary when compared to them. If it was in terms of physical strength, his physical strength was formidable indeed, but it was quite inferior when compared to the pig-riding young woman. If it was a competition of how mysterious their attacks were, then he couldn’t compare to Nether Maiden or Oblivion Maiden. However, Yang Ye was the most striking amongst them. He was completely blood red while endless slaughter intent and baleful energy surged out from within him, so it was impossible for others not to notice him!

15 minutes later.

“AH!!” A shrill cry suddenly resounded, and then the others watched as a Quasi Emperor of the Mo Clan was smashed into mush by the pig-riding young woman’s club.

“AH!!” Another shrill cry resounded. A Quasi Emperor of the Mo Clan was decomposing incessantly in midair, and it only took a moment for him to be completely disintegrated!

“AH!!” Shrill cries were still resounding!

Li Laoguai and Feng Qingyu’s eyes were filled with horror as they watched all of this. They were quite free because Yang Ye and the others’ main objective were the Quasi Emperors of the Mo Clan. They’d intended to join the battle, but when they saw the experts of the other 3 clans being trapped while the Quasi Emperors of the Mo Clan were being slaughtered, they had no intention to attack anymore.

Both of them exchanged glances, and they saw the intention to retreat within each other’s eyes!

“My Mo Clan is willing to retreat!” Suddenly, Mo Qingfeng’s voice resounded. At this moment, his eyes were blood red, and he seemed like he’d gone mad. Because up until this point in the battle, his Mo Clan had lost 4 Quasi Emperors in such a short period. Even though the highest cultivation amongst the 4 people before him was only at the high-rank of the Saint Realm, their strengths were even more terrifying than Quasi Emperors!

It was even to the extent that he felt they could probably fight a few Emperors together!

They were too abnormal!

The most terrifying part was that another hall master of the Nether Pavilion was hiding somewhere, and that hall master’s ability to create barriers had instantly crippled the other 3 clans.

If they were to continue fighting, then all the Quasi Emperors of the Mo Clan would perish here, including Mo Qingfeng!

If they died here, then the Mo Clan would really be wiped off the face of the Central Divine Prefecture.

So, he had no choice but to admit defeat!

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly when he heard Mo Qingfeng, and he was about to speak when the pig-riding young woman spoke before him, “You want to surrender now? It’s too late! Those who offend my Nether Pavilion will be annihilated!”

As soon as she finished speaking, her figure shot forward explosively atop the huge white pig, and they shot towards the Quasi Emperor of the Mo Clan who was standing before them. That Quasi Emperor’s pupils constricted, and he wasn’t even able to react before the pig slammed against him. At the same time, a spiked club smashed down onto his head.

Bang!

His head instantly exploded apart while his body was transformed into a pile of mush that rained down from midair.

“AH!!” Meanwhile, another shrill cry resounded, and everyone hurriedly looked towards its source. They saw a pitch black chain pierce through the forehead of a Quasi Emperor from the Mo Clan.

That Quasi Emperor’s eyes were opened wide, and it didn’t take long for them to dim down.

Now, only Mo Qingfeng and Mo Tian were left.

It was 4 against 2!

Mo Qingfeng took a deep breath and slowly closed his eyes. A moment later, he suddenly opened them again, and his eyes were filled with ferocity and madness. He didn’t waste his breath again, and his stomach started to swell up swiftly. At the same time, the spirit energy in the area around him started to become violent!

He was about to detonate himself!

A Quasi Emperor was about to detonate himself!

Everyone here was astounded by this scene. Xiao Bieli and the others’ expressions changed drastically. After all, if Mo Qingfeng detonated himself, then even if White Deer Dimension remained intact, White Deer City would be obliterated. Moreover, all the cultivators beneath the Saint Realm in the surroundings would probably die as well. It was even to the extent that Saints might not be able to survive the explosion.

How terrifying was the explosion created by the self-detonation of a Quasi Emperor?

Yang Ye naturally understood all of that, so he was about to attack. However, Nether Maiden stopped him.

Yang Ye gazed at Nether Maiden with a puzzled gaze, and the latter spoke flatly, “Let him explode!”

Yang Ye nodded out of trust for her, and he didn’t do anything. Even though he didn’t know why Nether Maiden and the others intended to let Mo Qingfeng detonate himself, Yang Ye knew that they were definitely confident or had some sort of way to deal with the explosion!

Feng Qingyu and Li Laoguai’s expressions changed drastically when they saw that Mo Qingfeng intended to detonate himself, and they didn’t hesitate to flash swiftly towards the distance.

However, they’d merely moved over 5km away when a practically translucent barrier appeared around them and trapped them.

“Bitches! Let’s all die together!” Meanwhile, Mo Qingfeng suddenly roared madly with laughter, and then his figure exploded apart. A terrifying tempest of energy immediately swept out from him, and it instantly spread 300m in all directions. At the same time, everyone’s expressions changed drastically, and countless started fleeing madly towards the surroundings.

However, the tempest of energy actually stopped abruptly, and then it slowly shrunk backwards, bit by bit!

Everyone here was stunned by this scene!

Yang Ye was stunned as well, but it didn’t take long for him to realize what was going on. A square barrier had appeared around the tempest. It wasn’t the tempest that was shrink, it was the square barrier that was shrinking, and the tempest of energy was being compressed by the barrier and shrunk incessantly!

Yang Ye’s pupils instantly constricted at the sight of this!

How terrifying was the explosion of a Quasi Emperor? Yet now, it was being trapped by the barrier. So, how terrifying was that hall master who’d created the barrier?

The experts of the other 3 clans were shocked by this scene as well. In the past, they’d already had a truly high opinion of the Nether Pavilion’s hall master’s strengths. Yet now, they knew that they’d still underestimated them, and they’d absolutely underestimated those hall masters. Every single one of the hall masters from the Nether Pavilion was much stronger than they’d ever imagined!

Just 4 hall masters of the Nether Pavilion had rendered their 4 clans helpless, so what would happen if all 10 were here?

It didn’t take long for the tempest of energy which was created by Mo Qingfeng’s self-detonation to be crushed into bits, and it was obliterated.

The last remaining Quasi Emperor of the Mo Clan, Mo Tian, was instantly filled with despair when he witnessed this scene.

It was over!

Everything was over!

One of the 4 great clans of the Central Divine Prefecture, the Mo Clan, had come to an end just like that. Even though the Mo Clan still existed, but how could the Mo Clan which had lost all its Quasi Emperors maintain its foothold in the Central Divine Prefecture?

From this moment onward, the 4 great clans of the Central Divine Prefecture were no more, and then were only 3 great clans!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly vanished on the spot. Mo Tian’s expression changed drastically, but Yang Ye was already behind him a moment later. At the same time, Mo Tian’s eyes had opened wide, and it didn’t take long for the color within them to fade away.

He refuses to let even one survive!How ruthless!

The hearts of all the experts from the other 3 clans shook when they witnessed this scene! The pig-riding young woman glanced at Yang Ye as well, but she didn’t say anything.

Meanwhile, the barrier that trapped the other 3 clans in place had vanished abruptly. However, no one dared to attack, and no one dared to leave as well.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly gazed at the Mu Clan, and it caused the expressions of the members of the Mu Clan to change slightly. However, the beautiful woman who led the ground remained calm, and there wasn’t even the slightest ripple in her composure.

“I want to ask about someone. Does a person called A’Qing exist in the Mu Clan?” Yang Ye hadn’t forgotten Elder Mu’s request. When Elder Mu ignited his soul and detonated himself that day, he’d asked Yang Ye to inquire about a person called A’Qing once Yang Ye arrived at the Radiant Dimension. If that person didn’t exist in the Mu Clan, then according to Elder Mu’s request, the Mu Clan had no further reason to exist!

The expressions of the experts from the Mu Clan changed when they heard Yang Ye. As for the beautiful woman who led the group, there was shock, bewilderment, and a trace of excitement in her eyes. She spoke in a trembling voice, “Who are you?”

Yang Ye slowly tightened his grasp on Heaven’s Gravestone and said, “Answer me!”

The beautiful woman was so excited that she wasn’t able to speak properly, “You know him, you definitely know him! You’re from the lower dimensions, you’re from the lower dimensions! Right?”

Yang Ye gazed at her for a short while, and then he slowly relaxed his grip and spoke with a trace of respect, “You’re A’Qing?”

She nodded and spoke in a trembling voice, “Is... is he alright?”

Yang Ye shook his head slightly, “He’s dead.”

He’s dead!

The beautiful woman seemed as if she’d been struck by lightning, and her countenance instantly turned ghastly pale. A long time passed before she looked towards the distance with a slightly blank gaze, “He’s dead... he’s dead....”

Yang Ye took a deep breath and said, “He asked me to tell you that you don’t have to wait for him anymore.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye gazed at the Zhuge Clan and said, “Is Zhuge Yun here?”

If it was before the battle, then they would have definitely ignored Yang Ye. Yet now, no one dared to do that!

The middle aged man who led the Zhuge Clan’s forces glanced at Yang Ye and said, “She isn’t in this dimension!”

“Then forget it!” Yang Ye glanced at the 3 clans and said, “Now, all of you can leave!”

Kill all of them? That wasn’t realistic at all! Moreover, it wasn’t necessary. The other 3 clans didn’t have any direct conflict with White Deer Academy. Only the Mo Clan did, and the Mo Clan was finished.

Now, White Deer Academy needed to rest and recuperate instead!

|The experts of the Zhuge Clan and Lu Clan glanced at Yang Ye before turning around and leaving.

Once the Zhuge Clan left, the symbols that covered the sky immediately vanished as well. Meanwhile, the Eye of the Heaven Dao appeared before them once more.

Nether Maiden glanced at Yang Ye and said, “We’re leaving.”

As she spoke, she was about to leave with the other 2. However, a terrifying wave of pressure suddenly erupted from the Eye of the Heaven Dao, and some of the Saints in the surroundings were instantly pressed down flat on the ground!

After that, a speck of violet light appeared within the Eye of the Heaven Dao, and it didn’t take long for a bolt of violet divine lightning to appear within everyone’s fields of vision.

Divine Lightning of Obliteration!

Everyone here was stunned at the sight of the violet divine lightning!

The eyes of the 3 women from the Nether Pavilion had opened wide as well, and their eyes were filled with disbelief!

“Shit!” Yang Ye’s face became unsightly.
