Chapter 2375 – You’re Too Weak to Understand!

Yang Ye turned to look, and he saw a woman there.

She wore a white mourning dress and had a memorial tablet in her hands. There were only two words on the tablet—late husband.

She just gazed calmly at him, but Yang Ye felt a chill run down his spine!

However, Yang Ye remained very calm. He’d experienced many things in life, so while this situation was very dangerous, it wasn’t enough to make him panic.

Yang Ye steadied himself, glanced at her, and then walked forward slowly.

The Sword Precursor was in his grasp.

A blood red sword!

Suddenly, she appeared in front of Yang Ye. She was very close to him, less than 2 meters away.

Yang Ye could see her even more clearly now.

She was quite beautiful, but her face was pale, and she emanated a ghastly aura. To be a little blunt, she didn’t seem normal at all!

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and asked, “Senior, do you need something?”

She took a step forward and looked Yang Ye in the eyes, “Can you get something for me outside this forest?”

Outside the forest?

Yang Ye pointed at the direction he came from, “That way?”

She shook her head and pointed in the opposite direction, “That way!”

Yang Ye’s expression changed. It was where Nan Yu had told him not to go.

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and said, “It’s dangerous, very dangerous.”

She spoke indifferently, “Is it not dangerous now?”

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly, and then he swung his sword at her.

The Sword Domain!

Three swings.

He took the initiative to gain the upper hand!

His current limit was three wings, and the might of it was weaker than Two World Realm experts but stronger than One World Realm experts. As for four swings, it was around the strength of a Two World Realm expert. But at this moment, he didn’t dare to use it unless he had no other choice.

The might of three swings was sufficient to obliterate the world!

However, it stopped half an inch away from her head.

A strand of hair had coiled around his sword!

It was her hair!

Yang Ye’s sword seemed like it had been frozen in place by the hair, and it couldn’t move at all.

She didn’t say anything and just gazed at him.

Yang Ye thought for a moment and said, “Senior, your strength is extraordinary. I was shocked by your strength when I saw you, so I wanted to see guidance from you. Sigh, I’m too weak. Thank you for your guidance.”

She looked him in the eye, “Will you go or not?”

Yang Ye spoke bitterly, “Senior, you’re so strong, yet even you dare not go. So, wouldn’t I just be giving my life away?”

She shook her head, “Since you were able to get here, it proves you’re not ordinary. Perhaps you’ll survive?”

Yang Ye replied, ‘What if I die?”

She gazed at him, “Then you can die a little later. Otherwise, you’ll die now. Choose!”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

She released his sword, but she was still staring at him.

Yang Ye closed his eyes slowly. How were his chances if he fought her head-on? The answer was that he had no chance at all!

Since she could stop that attack of his with such ease, she was at least a Two World or even Three World Realm expert.

Suddenly, she said, “It comes with benefits!”

Benefits?

Yang Ye gazed at her, and she explained indifferently, “If you can help me, I’ll reward you.”

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings and said, “Senior, I came with a woman. Her strength is much greater than mine. Why don’t you ask her?”

Loyalty?

He didn’t care about that where Nanli Meng was concerned. She’d repeatedly concealed herself when there was danger and left him to fend for himself!

The woman glanced behind Yang Ye and said, “You’re weak and easy to bully.”

Yang Ye was stunned speechless.

“Haha!” Suddenly, roaring laughter resounded from behind Yang Ye. Obviously, it was Nanli Meng.

She walked over to Yang Ye and smiled at him, “Angry?”

Yang Ye replied indifferently, “There’s nothing to be angry about. She makes absolute sense. It’s my fault for being weak.”

Nanli Meng smiled, “You have a good mentality!”

As she spoke, she gazed at the woman before Yang Ye, “What do you want him to do over there? Why don’t you tell us about it?”

The woman glanced at Nanli Meng, “You’re very confident to dare to show yourself before me!”

Nanli Meng chuckled and pointed at Yang Ye, “I should tell you that he has a very, very formidable sister. While she isn’t here, she’ll definitely avenge him if you kill him. At that time, you’ll be in great trouble!”

The woman walked over to Nanli Meng and looked her in the eyes, “Are you threatening me?”

Nanli Meng smiled, “I was just joking. But do you want to spar a little first?”

The woman’s hair suddenly floated up before Nanli Meng, and the latter clenched her fists slowly. In an instant, dark clouds covered the forest and lightning converged throughout the forest.

The woman’s eyes narrowed slightly, “Spells! I never expected someone outside to possess such spells!”

Her voice had a trace of seriousness, and she wasn’t as calm and carefree as she had been.

Nanli Meng smiled, “In my opinion, we can help, but you must repay us, and it has to be sufficient payment!”

The woman gazed at Nanli Meng for a long time, and then she turned around slowly and gazed into the depths of the forest, “There’s a desolate plain over there, and a Primal Emperor is buried there. My husband was one of the Primal Emperor’s followers, and he died there too. I want his corpse. If you can get his corpse for me…”

She flipped her palm, and a black seal floated there.

Meanwhile, Snowy wanted to come outside, but Yang Ye stopped her. It was best to be cautious and hide Snowy from the eyes of outsiders.

In the Primordial Pagoda, Snowy looked up into the sky with a pitiable glow in her eyes. Actually, she was looking at the black seal above the woman’s palm.

Wang Erya and Oxxy were by Snowy’s side. Oxxy stood silently behind Erya and Snowy. Erya licked her tanghulu and passed it to Snowy, “That thing isn’t bad! Tell Big Brother Yang to take it!”

Snowy licked the tanghulu and nodded to display her agreement!

However, Erya suddenly added, “She’s very strong. He’s probably no match for her!”

Snowy didn’t pay those words any attention.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye gazed at the black seal and asked, “What’s that?”

She glanced at him, “The Seal of Suppression. It can suppress a person’s realm of cultivation.”

“Suppress cultivation?” Yang Ye was stunned, “What do you mean?”

“She means that you can use it to suppress someone’s cultivation!” Nanli Meng suddenly explained, “If you’re in battle with someone, and that person is a Two World Realm expert, then you can use it to suppress that person into a One World Realm expert. Understand?!”

Yang Ye’s eyes immediately burned slightly with desire!

Suppression of cultivation!

If he obtained it, then he wouldn’t have to fear Two World Realm experts anymore! Even if he encountered a Three World Realm expert, he could use it to drag that expert down to the Two World Realm! Simply speaking, he could reduce his enemies’ strength!

It was a treasure!

Yang Ye’s eyes burned with desire. Meanwhile, the woman put the seal away.

Nanli Meng suddenly asked, “What kind of dangers await over there?”

The woman closed her eyes slowly, “The words of an Emperor!”

Nanli Meng frowned slightly, “What do you mean?”

She explained, “That Primal Emperor didn’t want to be disturbed when he died, and those words filled that desolate plain with a mysterious force. No living being is able to enter that place!”

Yang Ye was astounded, “Just some words are that strong?”

The woman glanced at Yang Ye, “Weakness limits your imagination!”

Yang Ye’s face was completely dark. Can she just not try to strike a blow to my confidence?

Meanwhile, Nanli Meng suddenly asked, “Even you can’t get close to it?”

The woman nodded slightly, “I can’t!”

Nanli Meng asked, “Then why do you think he can?”

The woman glanced at Yang Ye, “Perhaps he’ll be lucky?”

Nanli Meng was at a loss for words.

The corners of Yang Ye’s mouth twitched. If it wasn’t for the fact that he was really no match for her, he really wanted to press her against the ground and sand her face off!

Meanwhile, Nanli Meng gazed at Yang Ye, “Let’s go!”

Yang Ye gazed at her with astonishment, “We’re really going?”

“Do you have a choice?” She glared at him and then pulled him away.

The woman glanced at Yang Ye and Nanli Meng, and then she looked down at the memorial tablet in her grasp, “Honey… I don’t have much time left!”

Meanwhile, Yang Ye gazed at Nanli Meng, “Why did you really come to this battlefield?”

Nanli Meng glanced at Yang Ye, “An Emperor, do you know what a Primal Emperor is? It’s a true expert, a real expert. Don’t you want to see one for yourself?”

She ignored Yang Ye and sped up.

Yang Ye noticed that there was excitement in her eyes, and a wisp of madness.

Yang Ye fell silent on the spot for a short while, and then he followed her.

…

Not long after they left, a sword cultivator in a cloud white robe arrived in the forest. He’d come from the desolate plains, but he’d just happened to miss Yang Ye and Nanli Meng.

The sword cultivator encountered the woman with the memorial tablet, and she was looking at him too.

The woman suddenly said, “Another sword cultivator was just here!”

The sword cultivator nodded slightly, “I sensed his aura.”

She said, “He’s much, much weaker than you!”Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

The sword cultivator shook his head, “You’re wrong.”

The woman asked while sounding quite unconvinced, “What do you mean?”

The sword cultivator glanced in the direction Yang Ye and Nanli Meng had left toward, and then he said, “The more ties he has, the stronger he will be.”

He moved his gaze away and looked at the woman again, “Once I severed my final ties, I’ve never lost throughout my path, but I lost to him once.”

“Impossible!” The woman spoke loudly, “I can kill him with ease! But I can’t resist a single swing of your sword!”

The sword cultivator shook his head, “You’re too weak to understand!”

Once he finished speaking, he walked off into the distance, but he’d only walked a few steps when he stopped once more. He turned around and asked, “Can you tell me where’s the most dangerous place here?”
