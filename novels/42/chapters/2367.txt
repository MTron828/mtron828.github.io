Chapter 2368 – Stop!

How could Yang Ye dare to act carelessly?

However, he didn’t choose to go head-on against the axe. He tapped the tip of his foot against the ground and moved to the side. At the same time, a blood red sword stabbed at the headless man’s shoulder!

But Yang Ye seemed to have underestimated the headless man’s reaction speed. At the instant his axe missed, the headless man’s axe had swept horizontally, and it was so powerful that Yang Ye felt suffocated.

If it struck him, even his body would be transformed into mush!

He didn’t dare take it head-on!

Yang Ye tapped the tip of his foot against the ground and floated around 30m back.

Hiss!

The axe missed, and then the headless man stomped his right foot down.

Bang!

The ground collapsed!

At the same time, he relied on the counterforce to leap up and instantly arrive before Yang Ye while his axe chopped down at Yang Ye.

It was simply capable of chopping open the world!

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly as he stomped his right foot down.

Hiss!

Yang Ye transformed into a ray of light that moved 300m back while he slowly raised his blood red sword with both hands.

The headless man hurled the huge axe at Yang Ye.Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

It tore through the air and blasted open everything before it!

“Slash!” As soon as Yang Ye said that, his sword descended.

The Sword Domain!

Two swings!

As soon as the second swing descended, a rumbling explosion resounded. Yang Ye was pushed over 1km back! As for the axe, it flew back to the headless man’s grasp. However, it wasn’t that easy for him to catch either. At the instant he grabbed it, the headless man had been pushed over 300m back as he dispersed the force within the axe!

But just a moment later, the headless man charged at Yang Ye again.

Suddenly, two rays of golden light flashed.

Flying blades!

Two golden flying blades!

The headless man didn’t even attempt to dodge the flying blades. He swung his axe horizontally and blasted them away, but three swords shot over like bolts of lightning from behind the flying blades!

The headless man still didn’t dodge and swung the axe swiftly.

Bang! Bang! Bang!

Three swords were blasted away. Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly appeared before the headless man, and a ray of blood red sword energy descended. The headless man immediately raised his huge axe against it!

Bang!

They immediately split apart upon colliding, and both of them were pushed back.

Suddenly, two flying blades and three swords flashed, and they shot toward the headless man’s weak points!

The headless man had just stopped himself when he swiftly swung his axe.

Bang!

A wave of powerful light rippled out of the axe, and it blasted Yang Ye’s flying blades and swords to where they’d come from. Moreover, the headless man suddenly took a step forward and swung his axe at Yang Ye from afar.

A powerful aura immediately locked onto Yang Ye!

Hiss!

The space before the headless man suddenly cracked open, and it was like cloth which had been sliced open by a sword.

The world was split open before the axe!

Yang Ye’s expression changed from the sight of this. Meanwhile, Nanli Meng’s voice resounded in his mind, “Watch out! It’s the strength of two worlds!”

Two worlds?

Yang Ye didn’t have the time to think about it. He grabbed the Sword Precursor with both hands while his Profound Primal Energy surged madly into his arms. A moment later, he swung it down with both hands.

The Sword Domain!

Three swings!

Yang Ye didn’t dare to hold back at all when facing this attack, and he immediately swung his sword three times with the Sword Domain.

It could slice open the world!

However, as soon as it descended, his expression changed drastically, and then his figure was instantly blasted over 3km away!

As soon as he stopped himself, a wisp of blood seeped out from the corner of his mouth.

Moreover, a huge expanse of the ground behind him started to collapse!

The headless man was absolutely strong!

Yang Ye looked up at the headless man. The man’s strength was absolutely formidable! Especially that last attack! It could be said that if it was before, when he was still at the True Dao Realm, he wouldn’t have been able to resist it. Even now, he was barely able to accomplish that!

Suddenly, the headless man’s axe shot through the air at Yang Ye!

Hiss!

The space in a huge area between them instantly turned ethereal.

“The strength of two worlds in a single axe!” Meanwhile, Nanli Meng’s voice resounded in Yang Ye’s head, “Fight! Fight with all you’ve got! If you’re able to last 100 rounds against him, then ordinary Limitbreaker Realm experts will be no threat to you!”

Fight!

A ferocious smile curled up on Yang Ye’s lips. His desire to fight had been aroused!

Since he advanced from the True Dao Realm, he hadn’t truly fought to his heart’s content! Now, he wanted to fight!

Bang!

A powerful wave of sword intent swept out of Yang Ye, and then a sword howl resounded as a sword stabbed at the axe.

Boom!

As soon as they collided, the sword energy was blasted back. Meanwhile, a figure suddenly appeared behind the headless man.

Backstab!

Yang Ye hadn’t used it for a very, very long time. Now, he was using it again.

There were no weak techniques, only weak users. His current strength couldn’t be compared to the test, and Backstab’s might couldn’t be compared to the past either!

A speck of cold light stabbed at the headless man’s back, but it missed!

It missed!

Yang Ye turned around immediately and swung his sword. Meanwhile, a fist slammed against his stomach!

Bang!

Yang Ye’s body curled up as it flew back.

The headless man stretched out his hand and gestured, and the axe behind Yang Ye immediately shot at his back. It was going straight for the back of his head! Yang Ye didn’t turn around, he just issued a command in his heart and three swords swiftly shot out of the Sword Gourd. They immediately transformed into three rays of golden light that slammed against the axe.

Bang! Bang! Bang!

Explosions resounded behind Yang Ye, and Yang Ye shot at the headless man.

The headless man took a step forward, clenched his right fist, and slammed it forward.

Bang!

The space around the headless man’s fist was obliterated. The strength within it hadn’t leaked out at all, and all of it was converged within the fist.

It carried the strength of two worlds.

As soon as Yang Ye’s sword descended upon the fist, it trembled violently and curved into a strange arc. If the Sword Precursor hadn’t risen to the ranks of Divine Treasures, this punch would have shattered it!

bang!

The powerful force of it blasted Yang Ye away.

Yang Ye’s feet were dragged against the ground as the force pushed him back, and it went on for a few breaths of time before Yang Ye suddenly stabbed his sword into the ground.

Hiss!

Yang Ye finally stopped!

A wisp of blood seeped out slowly from the corner of his mouth!

Suddenly, the headless man squatted down, and Yang Ye’s eyelids twitched from the sight of this.

What is that fellow doing?

A moment later, the headless man stomped his feet down, and he slammed his axe at Yang Ye.

Axe Fusion!

A powerful aura locked onto Yang Ye. At this moment, he couldn’t dodge at all, and the aura was suffocating!

Face it!

He could only face it head-on!

Yang Ye took a deep breath as he slowly placed the Sword Precursor against his forehead while his Profound Primal Energy and profound energy surged madly into his sword. Moreover, the veins on his arms had started to bulge.

Physical strength!

Besides that, endless sword intent and slaughter intent swept out from within him. In the end, all of it surged into the sword in his grasp.

The axe arrived!

Yang Ye stabbed the Sword Precursor forward with both hands!

The Sword Domain!

One swing!

A second swing!

A third swing!

After the third swing, he swung again!

Four swings!

As soon as the fourth swing was completed, Yang Ye’s body cracked open. Especially his arms, they cracked open in layers!

His ultimate attack!

This could be considered as his strongest attack while not relying on external sources of strength like the Sword Gourd and Soul Devouring Technique!

He'd truly put his all in this attack!

All four attacks overlapped.

Bang!

A figure was blasted away!

It wasn’t Yang Ye but the headless man. The headless man was blasted to the distant mountain, and when he descended to the ground, the powerful force of the collision still pushed him backward repeatedly. In the end, his body slammed against the mountain wall and finally stopped. Once he stopped, the axe in his grasp shattered into pieces!

Yang Ye was in a worse state. As soon as he finished swinging those four attacks, his body collapsed. Countless strands of blood were seeping out incessantly from him, and they instantly bathed him in blood!

It was his full strength that was behind that attack!

Four overlapped swings of the Sword Domain could rival the strength of two worlds. However, his body couldn’t endure such strength, so the consequence of forcefully using it was the collapse of his body!

If his body hadn’t been tempered and enhanced by the Dragon Ball of the Primal True Dragon, that attack would have been enough to make his body shatter completely to the point even his soul would have been destroyed!

Yang Ye laid there on the ground while his Primordial Violet Energy ceaselessly repaired his body. As for the Eternal Energy, it remained completely silent!

Suddenly, the headless man charged at Yang Ye. Every step he took caused the ground to tremble violently as if it was an earthquake! It was absolutely shocking!

Suddenly, a ray of white light flashed out of Yang Ye, and it dispersed to reveal Snowy.

Snowy clenched her paws as she gazed at the headless man. She was slightly nervous and afraid, but she couldn’t run.

Yang Ye was behind her!

The headless man was growing closer and closer. Right when he arrived around 30m away, Snowy suddenly spat out countless Eternal Immortal Crystals.

There were many of them, and they were different than normal Eternal Immortal Crystals. They had been made by her with Primordial Violet Energy, so ordinary Eternal Immortal Crystals couldn’t compare to them at all.

Meanwhile, the headless man stopped.

Snowy pointed at the crystals, and then pointed at the headless man. She was saying that they were his, so just stop fighting!

Meanwhile, she placed her other paw behind her back. There was an ethereal axe in it.

The headless man just stood there.
