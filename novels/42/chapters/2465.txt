The Primal Royal Crocodile was no fool. It was very well aware that it had bitten off more than it could chew. It could be said that if it didn’t choose to surrender, then it would definitely be eaten alive by that young girl!

Of course, most importantly, that white little fellow over there seemed to be the Sprite Progenitor!

The Sprite Progenitor!

The crocodile wasn’t very certain!Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Snowy was delighted when she heard it, and she quickly flew over it and patted it on the head. She was very pleased!

The crocodile was certain once it saw Snowy from up close.

The Sprite Progenitor! This little fellow really was the Sprite Progenitor!

Snowy waved her paws to tell the crocodile to become smaller.

The latter clearly understood her and immediately shrunk over 10 times smaller.

Snowy grinned and was even more pleased!

Just like that, she took it into the Primordial Pagoda. Snowy even selected the ocean for it. Presently, it was the only demon in that ocean!

The crocodile was absolutely overjoyed by this!

It controlled the entire ocean in this world!

Outside the Primordial Pagoda.

Erya walked over to Yang Ye and spoke solemnly, “Big Brother Yang, Snowy can’t keep doing this! I won’t get to eat so, so much meat if she keeps doing this!”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

Erya sighed softly, “Big Brother Yang, you should work harder! Snowy is recruiting so many lackeys all because of you! If you were stronger, she wouldn’t recruit more! If she stops recruiting, I’ll get to eat lots of meat. So, in conclusion, the reason I can’t eat lots of meat is you. It’s your fault, so you must compensate me. Understand?”

Yang Ye glared at her, “Are you looking for a beating?”

Erya stuck out her tongue at him and ran off into the pagoda.

In the Primordial Pagoda, Erya went to the crocodile’s territory, and the crocodile that had been floating on the surface immediately sank down. It didn’t take long for the crocodile to reach the bottom.

It didn’t dare to show itself!

That young girl was too terrifying!

Erya grunted coldly and left to continue cooking her dragon meat!

…

Outside the Primordial Pagoda, Yang Ye continued forward. This time, he didn’t encounter any powerful demon beasts. Of course, there were many powerful demon beasts at the peak of the Four World Realm here. Now, he finally understood why this place was so difficult to cross!

There were no Five World Realm experts in Eternal Border, and the Four World Realm was the peak! But this place was filled with peak Four World Realm demon beasts! Not only were there many of them, all of them were very strong too. It could be said that ordinary Four World Realm experts weren’t able to fight them at all!

Ordinary Four World Realm experts would be courting death by coming here!

However, he didn’t see Zhao Wuji’s group all along the way!

Yang Ye seemed to have thought of something, and a cold smile curled up on his lips.

Yang Ye continued forward, and it didn’t take long for him to arrive upstream. The water here was very calm like it was deathly still!

It shouldn’t be this still!

However, Yang Ye was strong and brave, so he didn’t care. In any case, he had Erya and Snowy, so no matter what demon beast he faced, he could fight them even if he couldn’t subdue them. Or it should be said that he could beat them up first before subduing them! Erya would be the bad one, and Snowy would be the good one. They worked really well together!

Suddenly, the river water before Yang Ye rippled, and then it parted before him. It didn’t take long for a mermaid to appear in front of him.

Yang Ye looked her in the eyes, “Move aside, I won’t repeat myself!”

She looked Yang Ye in the eyes, “Is she the Sprite Progenitor?”

Yang Ye nodded.

The mermaid fell silent for a short while and said, “Don’t go further!”

Yang Ye asked, “Why?”

She replied softly, “Those people you’re pursuing did pass through here. However, they were being escorted, and they wanted us demons in the Eternal River to stop you.”

Yang Ye asked, “The experts of Eternal Kingdom?”

The mermaid nodded, “They’re very strong! And they are waiting for you.”

Waiting for Yang Ye!

Yang Ye suddenly chuckled. At this moment, he finally understood why Eternal Kingdom had captured the governor of White Emperor City. It was to lure him to them, and they accepted Zhao Wuji’s group so that he would be lured over as well!

Simply speaking, they were intentionally making him go to them!

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts and gazed at the mermaid, “Why are you telling me all of this?”

She replied, “All those years ago, if that Sprite Progenitor hadn’t been benevolent, then all of us would have died during that calamity. You have the Sprite Progenitor with you, and my instinct tells me that you’re not an evil person. So, you decide if you wish to continue forward or not!”

Once she finished speaking, she was about to leave!

Suddenly, Yang Ye said, “Come with me!”

She was stunned and forgot to answer him.

Yang Ye continued, “Chaos is about to arrive in this world. It’s very dangerous to stay here. Of course, you decide if you want to go with me!”

Meanwhile, Snowy appeared before her. Snowy cracked a smile and raised a fruit toward the mermaid!

The Chaotic Fruit!

The mermaid gulped when she saw it, “Is that for me?”

Snowy nodded and passed it to her.

She accepted it with slightly trembling hands!

She naturally knew what it was!

A short while passed before she glanced at Snowy and gazed at Yang Ye, “I’ll go with you!”

Yang Ye felt quite helpless because Snowy was still much better at it than him!

Just like that, Yang Ye’s army of demon beasts had one more member in it!

Once she arrived in the Primordial Pagoda, she quickly became friends with the Primal True Dragon and the others. She even had quite a good relationship with Erya. It was because she’d brought lots of underwater delicacies and some pearls that contained extremely pure spirit energy. Erya was very fond of those pearls, so she asked for over a dozen from the mermaid! After that, she invited the mermaid to enjoy their dragon feast!

Dragon meat!

When she gazed at the pot of dragon meat and thought of the Chaotic Fruit she’d put away, it was the first time in her life that she felt that good people were rewarded for their good deeds!

She’d merely been grateful to the previous Sprite Progenitor, so she’d warned Yang Ye and the current Sprite Progenitor. She hadn’t expected her kindness to bring such tremendous change to her life!

The Four World Realm had been the end of her path of cultivation!

But now, with that fruit in her grasp and the Sprite Progenitor’s assistance, the Five World Realm didn’t seem difficult at all!

On the Ascension Platform, the demons circled the huge pot and started feasting.

Snowy frequently tasted a few small pieces too. She felt it wasn’t bad, so she had a few more.

Outside the Primordial Pagoda, Yang Ye sped up and continued forward!

He knew that something was waiting for him ahead, and he was very well aware of the situation he was about to face.

It didn’t take long for Yang Ye to see the end of the river. There was a bridge there. The bridge wasn’t very long, and it led to the end ahead.

Yang Ye appeared on the bridge, and he saw a row of words there.

“I’ll be waiting in Eternal Kingdom, Tian Xiu!”

Tian Xiu!

Yang Ye walked over to those words, and he gazed at them for a long time before he suddenly started laughing, “You really have gone to Eternal Kingdom!”

Once he found out that she hadn’t died, Yang Ye knew that she should have gone to Eternal Kingdom.

Yang Ye looked up into the distance, grinned, and sped up.

Yang Ye was just halfway through the bridge when the river water on both sides started to roil, and then they rose up to form a barrier of water. The barrier of water enveloped the bridge and Yang Ye within it.

There were countless mysterious talismans on the barrier of water, and they flowed along with the water.

Moreover, the world within the barrier of water transformed into a void.

It was a world of its own!

A person appeared before Yang Ye, Zhao Wuji!

Zhao Wuji laughed coldly, “Yang Ye, do you know what this is? This…”

Yang Ye suddenly drew his sword and swung it.

A ray of sword energy flashed, and it flashed through Zhao Wuji’s body!

However, Zhao Wuji was completely fine!

It wasn’t his actual body!

Yang Ye frowned slightly!

Zhao Wuji laughed coldly, “Don’t waste your strength, this isn’t my real body. It’s just a projection. This is an Illusory Water Barrier created by an extraordinary expert of Eternal Kingdom. It forms an independent world. Of course, the important part is that it’s a mid-level world, a temporary mid-level world. Haha! A temporary mid-level world can support a Five World Realm expert, so suppression to the Four World Realm isn’t necessary!”

A temporary mid-level world!

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings. Yang Ye naturally understood what Zhao Wuji was trying to say. In other words, it was a Five World Realm expert of Eternal Kingdom who was here to kill him!

A real Five World Realm expert!

Zhao Wuji added, “Yang Ye, that Five World Realm expert from Eternal Kingdom is about to be here. Everyone from my Creation Sect and the Immortality Sect will be watching you die! So just wait for death to take you!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he gradually vanished amidst roaring laughter.

Only Yang Ye remained within the barrier.

Yang Ye didn’t try to break it. He just closed his eyes slowly and stood there with his sword in hand!

It didn’t take long for a middle aged man to appear out of thin air before him.

A Five World Realm expert!

The middle aged man’s aura was deep as an ocean and simply boundless. It even made an invisible wave of pressure appear on Yang Ye!

In the Primordial Pagoda, the mermaid suddenly asked, “Should we go outside and help?”

Erya took a huge bite of meat and shook her head, “No. Big Brother Yang is strong. If he’s no match for that fellow, then we aren’t either! Moreover, even if we’re going to fight, we should fight on a full stomach! Come on, let’s continue…”

The other demons exchanged glances. In the end, they gazed at Snowy.

Snowy blinked and was about to respond when Erya suddenly tore off a small piece of meat and raised it before Snowy’s mouth, “This is tasty!”

Snowy was stunned.
