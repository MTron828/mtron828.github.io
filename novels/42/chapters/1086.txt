Chapter 1087 – In The Name Of The Martial God!

Fight him as a group!

Everyone here was stunned!

Yang Ye and An Nanjing’s strengths were obvious for all to see. It could be said that while they were Half-Saints, their strengths weren’t inferior to Saints. Actually, they should be said to possess strengths which far surpassed Saints.

But Jun Hualuo had actually asked them to fight him together!

Everyone here was first shocked, but they didn’t laugh at Jun Hualuo once they recovered from it, nor did they think that Jun Hualuo was overestimating his strength.

The Martial Rankings!

Just those words gave Jun Hualuo the right to be arrogant!

There were no weaklings on the Martial Rankings!

That was absolutely no joke!

“Xu Fan, is this really necessary?” Su Shihe gazed at Xu Fan and said, “It’s just a competition between juniors. Yet you’ve even summoned someone from the Martial Rankings.”

Xu Fan laughed coldly, “Didn’t they want a fair fight? I gave them a fair fight! As for the Martial Rankings.... Haha! Hualuo was able to ascend the rankings yet they weren’t. Can that be blamed on Hualuo?”

Su Shihe’s face became gloomy. Meanwhile, Xu Fan added, “Besides that, didn’t you hear Hualuo? All 3 of them can fight him together. In the end, they have the advantage! Of course, it’s not a problem if they don’t dare to fight him. They just have to kowtow 10,000 times to my Law Faction, and then sever their own arms. Perhaps I’ll consider sparing them then!”

Su Shihe glanced at Xu Fan, and then he gazed at Yang Ye, “There are no weaklings on the Martial Rankings. Make your own choice!”

Yang Ye looked Su Shihe in the eyes and said, “We aren’t afraid of a battle. What we’re afraid of is if some shameless people interfere again later. Or if even older and even more shameless fellows interfere!”

“I guarantee that this match will be absolutely fair!” Su Shihe gazed at Yang Ye and said, “If you kill him, then I guarantee that even an Emperor won’t be able to kill you!”

If Yang Ye’s group killed Jun Hualuo, then it represented that their strength was sufficient to be ranked on the Martial Rankings. After all, Jun Hualuo was a Saint, and they were only Half-Saints!

Geniuses who could be ranked on the Martial Rankings were worthy of being protected by the Scholarly Faction at all costs!

Meanwhile, Xu Fan laughed coldly, “Don’t worry, I will absolutely not interfere in your battle. So long as you have the ability, feel free to kill him. I guarantee that I won’t interfere.”

Yang Ye gazed at Xu Fan and said, “Anyone who interferes is a swine, alright?”

Xu Fan’s eyes narrowed slightly, and a short while passed before he glanced at Su Shihe, “Alright. Anyone who interferes later is a swine! Su Shihe, remember what he said. Don’t accidentally be a swine later!”

Su Shihe shook his head slightly because Yang Ye’s words were equivalent to blocking off any chances he had to retreat with his life.

Yang Ye didn’t waste his breath at all and was about to ascend the arena. Meanwhile, An Nanjing suddenly obstructed his path and said, “I’ll do it!”

Yang Ye glanced at Jun Hualuo who stood in the arena and said, “He’s very strong!”

An Nanjing replied, “Trust me!”

Yang Ye gazed at her for a long time, and then he nodded, “Be careful!”

He knew that An Nanjing wanted him to maintain his strength. Because it was very likely that this battle wouldn’t be the end of it, and it was only just the beginning.

An Nanjing nodded lightly, and then she ascended the arena.

“She intends to fight Jun Hualuo on her own?”

Everyone here was stunned when they witnessed this scene! An Nanjing was only a Half-Saint, but Jun Hualuo was already a Saint. Moreover, he was an expert on the Martial Rankings.

She intends to surmount her realm of cultivation to challenge Jun Hualuo who’s an expert on the Martial Rankings!

Clamorous noise resounded throughout the surroundings!

“Is she alright in the head? Jun Hualuo is an expert on the Martial Rankings! She... she actually intends to surmount her realm of cultivation and fight him? Has she gone mad?”

“I have no doubt that she’s a genius, and all geniuses are confident. However, it’s very easy for confidence to become conceit. Now, she’s being conceited!”

“If she can surmount her realm of cultivation and defeat Senior Brother Jun Hualuo, then I’ll knock my head against a wall and kill myself here!”

“There have been cases of geniuses surmounting their realms of battle to challenge experts on the Martial Rankings. But those were just rumors. I never expected to actually witness it today. Interesting....’

Han Yu and Wu Yuan exchanged glances on the guest platform, and a huge amount of interest could be seen in their eyes.

Wu Yuan smiled, “I’m growing more and more interested in that little girl!”

Han Yu nodded lightly, “It’s interesting indeed!”

Su Shihe gazed at Yang Ye and said, “Are you sure that you intend to let her fight alone?”

Yang Ye nodded, “I trust her!”

Su Shihe took a deep and long glance at Yang Ye, and then he didn’t speak another word.

Meanwhile, Xu Fan laughed coldly, “What’s it like to overestimate one’s ability? I’ve finally witnessed it now.”

Yang Ye paid no attention to Xu Fan, and he gazed at An Nanjing instead. At this moment, An Nanjing and Jun Hualuo had already appeared in the battlefield within that pocket of space.

In the battlefield, Jun Hualuo was sizing up An Nanjing, and then he shook his head, “Your courage is commendable. Unfortunately, you overestimate your strength. I’ll give all of you one final chance. Ask those 2 friends of yours to join the battle as well. To be honest, I’m not interested in fighting all of you at all. So, I don’t want to waste my time with all of you!”

An Nanjing didn’t say anything. She just suddenly stomped her right foot against the ground, and then she transformed into a ray of golden light that shot forward.

Jun Hualuo’s expression remained unchanged, and then a silver folding fan appeared in his grasp. Meanwhile, Skysplit had arrived in front of him. Jun Hualuo tapped his folding fan forward, and it struck against the tip of An Nanjing’s spear.

Bang!

A loud explosion resounded, and then Skysplit and the folding fan shook violently before An Nanjing took a few dozen steps back. Meanwhile, Jun Hualuo didn’t move at all. However, some almost imperceptible cracks had appeared on his folding fan.

Xuwu Shen’s expression instantly became extremely solemn when he witnessed this scene. He glanced at Yang Ye but noticed that Yang Ye was very calm, so he couldn’t help but ask, “Are you not worried?”

“She asked me to trust her!” Yang Ye continued, “So, she’ll definitely win!”

Xuwu Shen was stunned, and then he laid down on the ground. Meanwhile, Yang Ye gazed at him and said, “Are you alright?”

Since Xuwu Shen executed that Emperor Rank technique just now, he seemed like he was terribly sick and couldn’t even get up.

Xuwu Shen shook his head slightly and said, “I’m just quite exhausted. I’ll be fine once I rest for a while.”

Yang Ye nodded slightly, and then he turned around and shot his gaze towards the arena.

In the battlefield, Jun Hualuo gazed at An Nanjing and nodded slightly, “Your spear isn’t bad, and your strength isn’t bad as well. But it’s far from sufficient!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Jun Hualuo took a step forward and instantly arrived before An Nanjing. After that, he tapped his fan forward. In an instant, a few dozen rays of silver light shot out from the fan and instantly enveloped An Nanjing.

An Nanjing moved her right leg back a little, and the tip of her left foot was pressed against the ground as she tightened her grip on Skysplit. A moment later, she suddenly shouted, “Moon Piercer!”

An Nanjing immediately transformed into a ray of golden light that shot forward. Everywhere she passed, space trembled and rippled violently. As for the rays of silver light, they were obliterated in an instant, and her spear was like a dazzling ray of golden light as it stabbed at Jun Hualuo.

It was impossible to dodge!

Jun Hualuo’s eyes narrowed slightly, and then he tapped his left foot slightly against the ground and transformed into a ray of light that shot forward explosively. At the same time, he stabbed his folding fan towards the tip of An Nanjing’s spear!

Bang!

Space instantly shook violently from the collision!

This time, both of them hadn’t been pushed back at all!

“Space Slasher!” Suddenly, An Nanjing’s voice resounded again, and then she shot into the air before she grabbed Skysplit with both hands and swung it down.

The expressions of all the spectators outside the arena changed when they saw this move.

Because even the space in her path had actually started to crack apart!

There was a trace of seriousness in Jun Hualuo’s eyes as well. His profound energy surged out as his right hand moved slightly, and the folding fan in his grasp was instantly unfolded. A beam of silver light shot into the sky, and it slammed against the tip of An Nanjing’s spear.

Bang!

In practically an instant, the beam of silver light shattered into pieces, and then An Nanjing shot down along with her spear and immediately arrived above Jun Hualuo. The latter’s expression changed slightly and hurriedly raised his folding fan to block her attack!

Bang!

A loud explosion resounded as the space throughout here shook once more! Meanwhile, Jun Hualuo’s legs instantly bent down, but it didn’t take long for him to roar furiously as a beam of silver energy shot out from within him and blasted An Nanjing away. At the same time, his figure moved over 50m back.

“Skysplit!” Suddenly, An Nanjing’s voice resounded once more, and then she swiftly tossed Skysplit at Jun Hualuo!

The spear tore through space, and the space before it was instantly torn apart!

At this moment, all the spectators outside the arena had solemn expressions on their faces.

The space there was terrifyingly strong, and even the joint attacks of a few dozen saints wouldn’t be able to shatter it! But An Nanjing had actually been able to tear it apart by herself!

At this moment, Xu Fan’s expression had turned slightly unsightly!

An Nanjing’s spear was extremely swift, and it had practically instantly arrived before Jun Hualuo. The latter’s pupils constricted as he instinctively raised his folding fan to block it.

Bang!

The folding fan had only just come into contact with Skysplit when it shattered apart and was completely obliterated! However, Jun Hualuo had been able to grab Skysplit at the same time. But the powerful force within it blasted him back, and he finally stopped himself after being pushed almost 3km back. Meanwhile, Skysplit had stabbed his chest, but it wasn’t deep and had only gone a few centimeters deep!

“Good!” Suddenly, Wu Yuan cried out with excitement from the guest platform, “What a girl! Every single one of those moves were no weaker than a high-grade Divine Rank technique, and they are comparable to an Emperor Rank technique when used as one. The most shocking part is that she was actually able to execute those 3 moves with such ease, and they were without any flaws at all! Amazing!”

Han Yu nodded slightly as well, “It’s shocking indeed!”

Meanwhile, Xu Fan suddenly glanced at them and said, “What are the two of you getting impatient for? Hasn’t the battle not ended yet?”

Wu Yuan smiled, “Brother Xu, I had no other intentions. I was just sighing with emotion. Hahaha....”

Xu Fan glanced at Wu Yuan, and then he shot his gaze back at the arena. At this moment, his face was quite gloomy.

An Nanjing waved her right hand, and Skysplit immediately flew back into her grasp. She was just about to launch another attack when Jun Hualuo suddenly chuckled, “I never expected that I would have actually been injured by a Half-Saint. Alright, you’re worthy of me being serious!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Jun Hualuo stretched his right hand forward slightly, and then suddenly twisted it. In an instant, a speck of silver light shot out from his fist. It was just the size of a grain when it first appeared, but it instantly expanded limitlessly, and it took less than a breath of time for the entire area to be covered in silver.

Jun Hualuo’s voice resounded, “I once relied on this technique to ascend the Martial Rankings. You can feel honored to be able to die by this technique today!”

An Nanjing suddenly looked up at the sky instead, and she said, “You probably really want to witness my true strength!”

Yang Ye’s gaze descended onto her, and he knew that she was speaking to him. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Meanwhile, she spoke again, “The 1st Martial God told me that the Martial God without a weapon is the true Martial God!”

As soon as she finished speaking, An Nanjing released her grasp on Skysplit, and then she took a step forward, “In the name of the Martial God....”
