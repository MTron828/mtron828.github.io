Chapter 1886 – Gold Form Statue!

A trap!

Yang Ye hadn’t expected the monkey to throw him into such a trap.

Sure enough, the bald man gazed at him with eyes filled with vigilance.

At this moment, Yang Ye wasn’t the same person he had been. No one in the medium universe didn’t fear Yang Ye right now.

Yang Ye gazed at the bald man. Yang Ye was a vengeful person, and the bald man had tried to kill him and take his sword. So, he’d naturally not forgotten that.

Meanwhile, the bald man suddenly said, “I advise you to not interfere in the business of my Buddhist Sect and that animal. Otherwise, I’m afraid nowhere will be safe for you once you go to the upper universe.”

“The Buddhist Sect?” Yang Ye frowned slightly, and then he gazed at the monkey, “It’s like a normal sect, but it’s quite huge!”

It was an organization!

Yang Ye gazed at the bald man, and then he gazed at the monkey. In the end, he’d made his decision. Yang Ye didn’t waste his breath, and he just issued a command in his heart. An ethereal sword instantly shot towards the bald man.

The bald man seemed very benevolent, but he was an absolute hypocrite. Yang Ye believed that even if he didn’t help the monkey now, the bald man would definitely not spare him once he went to the upper universe. Conversely, while the monkey was quite violent, he was someone worth making friends with!

The monkey’s expression changed when he saw Yang Ye attack, and he hurriedly said, “Be careful…”

Bang!

He hadn’t even finished speaking when Yang Ye was blasted over 10km away.

Yang Ye glanced at his chest after he stopped himself. There was a palm print there. Besides that, the skin around the palm print had cracked open.

Yang Ye was shocked. After all, his current physical defenses were extremely terrifying, yet he’d still been injured.

Yang Ye looked up at the bald man. Or to be more precise, he gazed at the small golden figure in the bald man’s grasp. What is that?

“It’s a precious treasure of the Buddhist Sect!” Suddenly, the monkey explained, “It’s the Gold Form Statue of a Buddhist Monarch!”

Yang Ye asked, “What’s that?”

The monkey spoke solemnly, “A very powerful thing. If I wasn’t injured, then not to mention his Gold Form Statue, I wouldn’t even fear his main body. However, I’m helpless against it now!”

Yang Ye gazed at the Gold Form Statue, and then he flipped his palm. The holy sword appeared in his grasp. A moment later, he vanished on the spot.

A wisp of ridicule curled up on the corners of the bald man’s mouth. An instant later, the golden figure in his grasp floated up slowly, and then a ray of golden light surged out from it. After that, a golden palm shot forward like a bolt of lightning.

Bang!

Yang Ye hadn’t even been able to react before he felt sharp pain come from his chest, and then his figure was blasted away.

The bald man was about to attack again, but a golden rod suddenly slammed down from above him.

He didn’t dare act carelessly, and he immediately gave up on chasing after Yang Ye. He formed a strange seal with his left hand, and then another ray of golden light surged out from the figure in his right hand. The golden light shot up into the air and slammed against the golden rod.

Boom!

A loud explosion resounded, and the sky trembled violently. In an instant, the entire sky was covered in golden light.

Suddenly, a mysterious wave of energy appeared here.

The Sword Domain!

However, it wasn’t the Invincible Sword Domain!

After that, a ray of light flashed.

The bald man’s expression changed drastically when Yang Ye released the Sword Domain. Danger! He sensed danger!

He immediately held the golden statue with both hands, and then it suddenly opened its eyes. A moment later, it said, “Ha!”

A golden character flashed forward.

Boom!

The space in a huge area shook violently, and then a terrifying wave of energy swept out. In an instant, Yang Ye’s sword energy was obliterated, and both Yang Ye and the monkey were blasted backwards repeatedly.

Around ten breaths of time later, everything calmed down here. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Yang Ye glanced at his hand. He couldn’t feel it anymore, and the numbness had been caused by the collision!

“Kid, that Gold Form Statue belongs to an almighty figure of the Buddhist Sect. Not to mention you, even my main body has to move aside before that person’s main body.” Meanwhile, Qiong Qi’s voice resounded in Yang Ye’s mind, “You may not know how strong that person is. Let me explain it like this. That person may not be weaker than your master. Understand now?”

The old man in Daoist’s robes!

The owner of the Gold Form Statue wasn’t weaker than the old man in Daoist’s robes!

Yang Ye’s face fell. No wonder that monkey was fleeing for his life in the beginning. That thing is really heaven defying!Yang Ye gazed at the monkey, “Brother Monkey, do you have any ideas?”

The monkey shook his head.

Yang Ye looked up at the bald man, and then he gazed at the golden figure. If the bald man didn’t have the golden figure, then both he and the monkey could kill the bald man in an instant.

However, he had that golden figure!

Yang Ye suddenly asked, “The Primordial Pagoda doesn’t fear that thing, right?”

“Of course!” Hou Qing continued, “However, the precondition is that you can bring that thing in here.”

Bring it into the Primordial Pagoda!

Yang Ye fell silent for a moment, and then he transformed into a ray of light that vanished on the spot.

A wisp of ridicule curled up the corners of the bald man’s mouth, “You overestimate your strength!”

As soon as he spoke those words, the golden status in his grasp floated up. In an instant, rays of golden light surged out. Every one of the rays of golden light was sufficient to obliterate the world around it.

Suddenly, a wave of mysterious energy appeared in the surroundings.

The Sword Domain!

After he released the Sword Domain, the golden light suddenly slowed down. Meanwhile, countless rays of sword energy crisscrossed within the Sword Domain, and they sliced the golden light into pieces.

The bald man’s expression changed drastically when he witnessed this. The golden figure in his grasp started to tremble violently once more. Suddenly, Yang Ye appeared in front of him.

At the same time, a sword stabbed towards the center of his forehead.

It was swift to the absolute limit!

However, the sword was stopped by a golden palm.

The golden palm belonged to the small golden statue!

Yang Ye’s sword couldn’t move an inch further.

The bald man’s eyes were filled with ridicule as he said, “Yang Ye, this is the Gold Form Status of holy Buddha of my Buddhist Sect. It…”

Suddenly, Yang Ye released his sword, and then the bald man watched with astonishment as Yang Ye grabbed the golden statue with both hands. However, Yang Ye hadn’t even touched it when a ray of golden light erupted from it and was about to blast Yang Ye’s hands away.

A ferocious glow flashed through Yang Ye’s eyes, and then he stomped his foot down, “Suppress!”

As soon as he finished speaking, the golden light was suppressed by his Sword Domain to the point of dimming down, and then Yang Ye exerted force with both hands and grabbed the golden statue. However, his arms instantly cracked open. Or to be more precise, they were on the verge of exploding apart!

Meanwhile, the tiny vortex within Yang Ye suddenly started spinning, and then the golden status was transported into the Primordial Pagoda.

However, Yang Ye almost fell to the ground at this point!

“What have you done?” Suddenly, the bale man spoke with shock. Because he’d actually lost the link he had with the golden statue.

Yang Ye didn’t speak. He tapped the tip of his foot against the ground and floated backwards. Meanwhile, the bald man suddenly transformed into a ray of golden light that shot towards him.

Yang Ye frowned at the sight of this. At this moment, he couldn’t fight back at all. Because forcefully taking the golden statue into the Primordial Pagoda hadn’t just heavily injured him, it had completely exhausted him.

Suddenly, the monkey appeared in front of him, and then the monkey’s rod swept forward.

Bang!

The bald man was blasted over 30km away!

As soon as he stopped himself, he spat out a few mouthfuls of blood. At this moment, he was finally panicking.

Now that he didn’t have the golden statue, both Yang Ye and the monkey weren’t existences he could rival in battle!

Flee!

That was the only thought left in the bald man’s mind. He acted as soon as he thought of it, and he turned around and transformed into a ray of light that shot into the sky.

A wisp of ridicule flashed through the monkey’s eyes, “You think you can run?”

As soon as he finished speaking, he stomped his right foot down, and a ray of golden light shot forward.

“AH!”

Two breaths of time later, a shrill and miserable cry resounded from far away in the sky.

It didn’t take long for the monkey to return to Yang Ye. He flicked a spatial ring to Yang Ye, “I owe you. Let me know if you ever need something.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he turned around and transformed into a ray of golden light that vanished into the sky. Obviously, he had urgent matters to attend to.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye took a deep breath, and then he took the spatial ring and left.

Around 15 minutes later, Yang Ye found a safe spot and entered the Primordial Pagoda.

He had to recuperate right now!

In the Primordial Pagoda, Yang Ye’s injuries were fully healed after being treated by the Primordial Violet Energy for around an hour.

Once he was fully healed, Yang Ye went over to the small golden statue. Qiong Qi and Hou Qing were there too.

At this moment, the golden statue was very calm. However, it was emanating faint golden light.

Suddenly, Hou Qing said, “Devour it and you’ll possess the Buddhist Sect’s Gold Form.”

Yang Ye was slightly stunned. He was about to speak when the tiny golden statue trembled violently, and then countless rays of golden light shot up into the sky and was about to pierce through this world.

Hou Qing and Qiong Qi shook their heads at the sight of this, and their gazes were filled with pity.
