Chapter 554 – The Tiny Vortex’s Origins

Yang Ye took a deep breath, suppressed the shock in his heart, and then walked through the door.

There was a white haired old man in a blue and white Daoist robe standing there while smiling at him, and the old man had a horsetail whisk in his hand. Yang Ye noticed that the old man’s body was ethereal.

Is the strand of some expert’s soul? Yang Ye’s heart was filled with questions.

The white haired old man sized up Yang Ye before he smiled. “The matters of the world are truly intriguing. This Primordial Pagoda of mine has actually acknowledged someone from a different world. How interesting!”

Yang Ye was shocked when he heard this, and he said, “Senior, are you the tiny vor.... Oh, I mean the owner of this Primordial Pagoda?”

“I was!” The white haired old man smiled. “But not anymore. Because it has acknowledged you. So, you are its owner now. Unfortunately, you’re too weak, and you’re barely able to open up the 1st level. But it’s fine, your body has been rebuilt by Primordial Violet Energy. I presume that it won’t be long before you’ll be able to access the 3rd level, obtain the divine techniques within it, and then traverse space to Milky Way System!”

“The 1st level? The 3rd level?” Shock covered Yang Ye’s face.

“The Primordial Pagoda has a total of 9 levels. Every single level is like a world. Now that you’ve opened up the 1st level, it means that you’re the owner of this world. The world on this 1st is probably not inferior in size to the Profounder Continent which you’re from. If you’re interested in such things, you can even bring others in here to live and propagate.” The white haired old man smiled as he explained.

Yang Ye gasped. This world within the pagoda isn’t inferior in size to Profounder Continent? I’m the owner of it? Am I dreaming?

The white haired old man smiled as he gazed at Yang Ye’s shocked expression. “This world you’re from is comparatively behind. All sorts of unbelievable divine techniques become inconceivable in your world. That’s very normal. However, you’ll quickly get used to it because you who possess the Primordial Pagoda will definitely witness even more things that they regard as inconceivable!”

A short while later, Yang Ye suppressed the shock in his heart and said, “Senior, you said every single level is like a world. In other words, there are nine worlds within this pagoda?”

The old man nodded and said, “Each level represents a world, and every single one has even more abundant spirit energy than the last. Let me put it like this. If it takes 1,000 years to cultivate into the Saint Realm in the 1st level, it might only take 900 years in the 2nd level. If one’s natural endowment was good, then it would probably take less than 100 years in the 9th level!”

Yang Ye gasped again. Isn’t this pagoda a little too terrifying? The Mortal Emperor Sword and all those Natural Dao Artifacts are utterly trash when compared to this pagoda!

Yang Ye said, “Senior, I have a question. Both you and this pagoda aren’t from this world, so why have the two of you appeared here? Moreover, why has this pagoda chosen me?”

The old man said, “It was caused by an accident. All those years ago, that little girl came over to my place to steal my medicinal pills, and she just happened to notice this pagoda, so she just took it with her as well. Of course, the main reason was that this pagoda wanted to go out into the world as well, so they quickly became friends. However, the two little fellows didn’t control their strength well when they were traveling through worlds, and they fell into a super black hole in the end. After that, they arrived here.”

So that little girl was the culprit! Yang Ye was quite amused.

The old man continued. “As for why it chose you. Haha, I can only say that it’s the will of the heavens. Because you have a special bloodline. Even I’m very curious why someone with such a bloodline would be countless universes away. Unfortunately, I’m just a strand of consciousness that was projected here, and I’m unable to enter the river of time to investigate.” Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“I have a special bloodline?” Yang Ye grew even more puzzled the more he heard.

The old man smiled and said, “Do you know why you’ve been rejected by this world? Because you might not belong to this world at all. You were too weak in the past, so the world wasn’t able to notice it. Yet now, you’ve attained a certain level of strength, and it has! So, it’s naturally impossible for it to tolerate your existence because you’re like an invader to this world, you’re an outsider!”

So that’s why!

Yang Ye slightly understood everything now. He’d thought that the world refused to tolerate his existence because of Luo Jun, and he’d never imagined that it was because he might have come from another world. But am I really not from this world and from the same world as the little girl and this old man?Then what about my mother and sister?

Yang Ye was quite lost!

Meanwhile, the old man said, “Every single level of the pagoda contains some things that I stored there. The 1st level is where I stored the most authentic Primordial Violet Energy. That Primordial Violet Energy isn’t something that the violet energy within your body can compare to. It was something that was only formed after I spent a thousand years refining and extracting it. I’d originally prepared it to refine a medicinal pill, but you’ve benefited from it now. Presently, your physical body has attained an undying state. Even if you soul is destroyed, your physical body will be able to exist forever!”

Yang Ye rubbed his nose and felt slightly embarrassed. Because the old man had spent a thousand years to create it, yet he’d consumed it just like that. So, he really felt quite bad and embarrassed. However, he was also overjoyed in his heart.

The white haired old man continued. “I stored some medicinal pills and Immortal Artifacts on the 2nd level. Those things will be very helpful to you, but you’re utterly incapable of opening the 2nd level with your current strength. Perhaps you can give it a try once you attain that so-called Monarch Realm of your world. As for the 3rd level, it contains some Daoist divine techniques. However, you’ll probably be unable to obtain it in a short period of time.”

“What about the 4th, 5th... or 9th?” asked Yang Ye.

The old man smiled. “Greedy kid, don’t reach beyond your grasp. You’ll naturally find out what they contain when your strength arrives at the corresponding level. Now, remember what I’m about to say. Firstly, you must become stronger as soon as possible to access the 2nd level and obtain the medicinal pills and Immortal Artifacts within it. Because this world of yours is on the verge of destruction, so you must possess formidable strength in order to protect yourself. Secondly, take good care of Little Seven. Once you access the 3rd level and learn the divine techniques within it, then bring her back home safely, or I should say that you should return home with her!”

“Senior, are you unable to come and get her even with your strength?” asked Yang Ye.

The white haired old man shook his head and said, “It’s only a strand of my consciousness which is standing before you right now. I’ve sent countless strands of my consciousness to the worlds within innumerable universes in order to find that little girl. If this strand of my consciousness is able to return safely to my world, then I’ll naturally be able to traverse space and take her back with me. But what if this strand of consciousness fails to return? Not only does it take a very long time to traverse the boundless corridors of space, it’s filled with endless danger. So, I can only entrust her to you. Understand?”

Yang Ye nodded and said, “I’ve obtained such benefits from Senior, so it’s naturally my duty to help Senior with that. Don’t worry, I’ll do my best to become stronger, and I’ll strive to access the 3rd level as soon as possible so that I can take her home.”

The old man smiled as he nodded. “I’m just a strand of consciousness, so I’m unable to bring anything with me, and I can’t give you any treasures as well. But I can still help you in other aspects. I noticed that you train in the sword, and your natural talent in it is extremely good as well. Since it’s like that, then I’ll help you improve a level in your Sword Dao!”

As soon as he finished speaking, a terrifying pressure swept out from the old man and enveloped Yang Ye. This pressure wasn’t much different in strength from the pressure the pagoda had exerted upon him just now, but he’d been able to resist the pressure since his physical body was far superior to its previous state. However, it still wasn’t easy.

“Activate your Sword Intent!” said the old man.

Yang Ye hurriedly utilized his Sword Intent to resist the pressure. However, his Sword Intent didn’t reduce the pressure he experienced. On the contrary, the pressure he suffered grew more and more terrifying.

Cold sweat gradually started flowing down Yang Ye’s forehead, and it wasn’t long before his entire body was drenched by cold sweat.

Yang Ye noticed that his Sword Intent seemed to be undergoing a transformation. Yes, he could clearly sense his Sword Intent transforming incessantly while the pressure acted upon him. This discovery delighted Yang Ye. He knew that the old man might be trying to improve his Sword Intent by a level and allow him to attain perfection in Sword Intent!

When he thought up to this point, Yang Ye crazily poured out his Sword Intent to resist the pressure.

After an unknown period of time passed, the pressure on Yang Ye’s body had vanished.

Bang!

Countless fine swords that were the size of fingers surged out from within Yang Ye. These swords seemed material yet seemed ethereal at the same time. It was like they were both ethereal and material, and it was impossible to distinguish clearly.

The fine swords grew larger and larger in number. In the end, the fine swords covered an area of about 1km around Yang Ye, and their numbers were still increasing!

“Perfection in Sword Intent! Everything is a sword!” Yang Ye took a deep breath while excitement flickered in his eyes. Every single one of these fine swords wasn’t weaker to a Heaven Rank treasure in might. At this moment, he was confident that he only had to utilize Sword Intent to kill fifth rank Exalt Realm experts. Just like how An Nanjing had blasted Elder Yun flying by merely utilizing her combined Intent and shouting ‘fuck off’ at Elder Yun!

Yang Ye bowed respectfully to the white haired old man and said, “Thank you, Senior!”

The white haired old man smiled and said, “I hope we’ll be able to meet soon. Farewell!” The old man vanished on the spot once he finished speaking.

After the old man left, Yang Ye fell silent on the spot for a short while. Everything that had occurred today felt like a dream to him. A special bloodline? Perfection in Sword Intent? Every level is a world....

A long time passed before Yang Ye shook his head and chuckled. He stopped thinking about all that, and he left the Primordial Pagoda.

“Yang Ye, you’re finally back!” When Yang Ye appeared once more on the back of the divine gold dragon, he saw Lu Jianyao’s face which was covered in anxiousness.

Yang Ye was just about to speak when Lu Jianyao hurriedly said, “Don’t explain anything. We don’t have any time now. Quickly! Let’s return quickly to the southern territory! My father sent me a transmission talisman just now. The Origin School, Ghost Sect, Flower Palace, and Brightmoon Sect have joined force and suddenly attacked the Sword Sect. The Sword Sect is probably on the verge of collapse now!”

A wisp of a ferocious expression instantly surged onto Yang Ye’s face when he heard this!
