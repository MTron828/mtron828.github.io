Chapter 2140 – Do You Want to Fight or Not?

As soon as An Nanjing finished speaking, Elysium suddenly slammed down at the Sovereign of Man.

At the same time, Yang Ye was behind the Sovereign of Man.

Yang Ye held Judgment in his grasp, and he was like a phantom that swept towards the Sovereign of Man’s nape.

They’d joined forces once more!

At this moment, an unprecedentedly solemn expression had appeared on the Sovereign of Man’s face.

His intuition told him that if he couldn’t resist their joint attack, then he would die!

Boom!

A terrifying aura swept out from within him, and then a huge golden dragon appeared from within him. Its claws slapped at Yang Ye and An Nanjing respectively.

Bang! Bang!

The power of its attack instantly blasted both Yang Ye and An Nanjing away.

The Sovereign of Man heaved a sigh of relief when he witnessed this. However, a cold speck of light suddenly appeared behind his head.

The Sovereign of Man’s hairs stood on end. However, his reaction was extremely swift. The golden dragon suddenly roared at Yang Ye, and a powerful dragon roar resounded through the world. At this instant, the space in a huge area cracked open before that roar.

Meanwhile, as soon as he saw the golden dragon, a huge white dragon appeared behind Yang Ye.

The Sky Dragon!

The Sky Dragon didn’t attack the golden dragon, and it just coiled around Yang Ye instead. So, Yang Ye hadn’t been affected by the dragon roar at all, and his sword didn’t stop at all. The Sovereign of Man had noticed this too, and he was horrified. At this instant, there were no other thoughts in his mind, and he just instinctively dodged to the side. However, it was still a little too late…

Hiss!

Half the Sovereign of Man’s head had been sliced off. While he’d been able to avoid this attack, a woman had appeared before him at the exact same instant. After that, she grabbed Elysium with both hands and slammed it down at him.

Bang!

The space as far as the eye could see cracked open at this instant.

At the same time, the Sovereign of Man’s golden dragon was blasted into two, and a howl of pain resounded. As for the Sovereign of Man himself, he was blasted away. At this moment, he was in an extremely terrible state. First, Yang Ye had taken half of his head; now, An Nanjing had dislocated all the bones in his body. While the Sovereign of Man was still alive, he’d lost his ability to fight!

However, at the instant he was blasted away, a ray of light flashed.

It was absolutely fast, and it was so fine that it was invisible to the eye.

It was Yang Ye’s ultimate attack!

He’d fused everything he’s learned into this attack. In other words, it was the enhanced version of Burial that he’d given his all to execute, even his physical strength. He’d used every force he possessed to support this attack!

It was his strongest attack, and it was his only attack that could kill a Sage!

At the instant that attack was executed, sorrow filled the Sovereign of Man’s eyes. He hadn’t seen the attack, but he sensed it.

Hiss!

The Sovereign of Man’s head flew up into the air. At the same instant, his soul flew out of his body. But right when he was about to flee, a halberd tore through the sky and slammed against his soul.

Bang!

His soul exploded into bits.

Meanwhile, the other three Sages at the side were dumbstruck.

It wasn’t that they refused to help the Sovereign of Man, it was that they hadn’t been able to react in time before the Sovereign of Man was dead. Since Yang Ye and An Nanjing appeared here and the battle came to an end, no more than four breaths of time had passed!

The battle had been concluded in an instant.

The Sovereign of Man was dead!

He’d died just like that!

At this moment, countless experts had arrived here.

Yang Ye ignored all of them and walked over to An Nanjing. He gazed at her hand, and he noticed that it had cracked open and blood was seeping out incessantly. An Nanjing hadn’t held back at all earlier, and it was especially so when she crushed the golden dragon. So, while she’d succeeded, the recoil from it had injured her.

Yang Ye took her hand, and his Primordial Violet Energy surged madly into her. It only took a short while for her arm to gradually return to normal.

Meanwhile, An Nanjing suddenly said, “Give it to me, alright?”

Yang Ye was slightly stunned, and then he gazed at Elysium, “You want it?”

An Nanjing nodded, “If I was able to merge with it completely earlier, the battle wouldn’t have been that difficult for me.” She paused for a moment and continued, “I sense an extremely strong desire to fight coming from it, and it needs someone to release that for it. I like that desire to fight.”

Elysium!

Yang Ye smiled, “Alright, it’s yours. However, you have to see if it’s willing!”

An Nanjing gazed at Elysium, “It’s lucky to be able to stay with me!”

Yang Ye was stunned speechless.

However, Elysium shook violently, and strands of battle intent surged into her.

It was answering her! Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Yang Ye smiled. While he cultivated in the body as well, and it was suitable to him too, An Nanjing was the one who was truly suitable for it. In his hands, he treated it like a sword, but it was different when held in An Nanjing’s hand. An Nanjing’s combat technique was something even Yang Ye couldn’t compare to. If it was just a pure close quarter battle using physical strength, then he had no chance to defeat her!

The Martial God!

What was the Martial God?

A god of the martial arts! An Nanjing may not have truly achieved that state, but Yang Ye firmly believed that she wasn’t far from it. An Nanjing was the only existence in the younger generation who could defeat him in close quarter combat.

Elysium had clearly sensed An Nanjing’s heart and will towards the Martial Dao, so it didn’t refuse An Nanjing, or it could be said that it liked her quite a bit. Of course, staying with Yang Ye wouldn’t insult it as well. However, it was more suited to An Nanjing while a sword suited Yang Ye better. Regardless of how strong his body was, his sword was his core.

The news of the Sovereign of Man’s death spread fast, and countless experts rushed over. The surroundings fell deathly silent when they saw the Sovereign of Man’s head floating in the air.

The leader of the human race!

The Sovereign of Man was the leader of the human race, but he’d been killed by humans!

No one attacked Yang Ye and An Nanjing, nor did they dare to!

The man and woman before them had jointly annihilated the Sovereign of Man, and they’d used just a few breaths of time to accomplish that. While they’d taken him by surprise, it was obvious that since they could kill him in such a short amount of time, their strength was absolutely terrifying!

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings and said, “Let’s go!”

Suddenly, a voice resounded, “You’re leaving just like that?”

Yang Ye looked over and saw an old man walk slowly in their direction. The old man’s back was slightly hunched, his hair was snowy white, and he seemed extremely old. However, his eyes were like the eyes of a wolf, they were sharp and fierce.

Yang Ye walked over to the old man, “What?”

Yang Ye confronted him directly!

The old man’s eyes narrowed slightly, “Yang Ye, you’re human too. Do you realize what will happen to the human race now that you’ve killed the Sovereign of Man? We will have no leader, and we’ll fall into a terribly passive state. You…”

Yang Ye interrupted the old man and asked, “So, only he can kill me?”

The old man fell silent.

Yang Ye continued, “As for what happens to the human race, all I want to ask you is, what does that have to do with me? What did the human race do when the Sovereign of Man gave the order to hunt me down? The human race helped him. What about all of you? All of you were hunting me too. Why didn’t you think about the fact that I’m human too? Now you’re talking about that? Don’t you feel ashamed?”

The old man’s face was gloomy and no one knew what he was thinking. Actually, there wasn’t any enmity between Yang Ye and the human race, and the only reason their relationship was this bad was because of the enmity between Yang Ye and the Sovereign of Man. Of course, that wasn’t important now. What was important was that Yang Ye would not stand on the human race’s side now, and he may even join forces with the god race to attack the human race!

Suddenly, Yang Ye said, “The Sovereign of Man isn’t the last person I kill, I’m going to kill all the Sages who hunted me down. Just you wait. I’ll kill every one of you!”

Yang Ye turned around and left with An Nanjing.

Suddenly, the old man stretched out his right hand, and a towering palm tore through the sky and clawed at Yang Ye and An Nanjing. Obviously, he didn’t want to just let them leave.

Suddenly, An Nanjing turned around, and then she twisted her right hand slightly. In an instant, Elysium transformed into a ray of red light that blasted the palm into bits!

The old man’s eyes instantly narrowed slightly from the sight of this, and then he gazed at An Nanjing with solemnness in his eyes.

A figure flashed through the sky and An Nanjing appeared before Elysium.

She took Elysium in her grasp and gazed at Yang Ye, “Do you want to fight or not?”

Yang Ye fell silent for a moment, and then he looked up at her, “Yes!”

An Nanjing immediately turned around and hurled Elysium at the old man.
