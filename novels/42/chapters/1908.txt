Chapter 1909 – A Brain is a Good Thing!

They didn’t say a word to each other all along the way.

Nansi Yin frequently glanced at Yang Ye, and there was a wisp of curiosity and complicated emotions in her eyes.

She was curious!

She was only staying with Yang Ye purely out of curiosity. She was curious about his identity and background. However, at this point, she’d realized that she hadn’t just been unable to find out anything about that, she’d grown even more curious!

He was a complete mystery!

…

At this moment, Yang Ye’s consciousness was within the Primordial Pagoda.

He checked through the spoils of the battle. The total amount of immortal crystals he’d obtained from Bei Cangyue and Xiu Shanyue were 103! 103 immortal crystals represented that he didn’t have to worry about his profound energy while in battle with others.

Yang Ye took one of the immortal crystals and went over to Snowy. He passed it over to Snowy and grinned, “Can you make this?”

Snowy took the immortal crystal and sniffed it. After that, she scanned it, and then she shook her head while Yang Ye watched with anticipation.

Yang Ye spoke softly, “You can’t?”

Snowy shook her head. In the end, she withdrew a pearl, it was the Spirit Energy Pearl he’d gotten her that day. After that, she started waving a claw.

It didn’t take long for Yang Ye to come to an understanding.

It wasn’t that Snowy couldn’t create immortal crystals, the Spirit Energy Pearl’s spirit energy wasn’t pure enough or abundant enough. So, she couldn’t create immortal crystals. In other words, she could create them if she had a good source of spirit energy.

Yang Ye committed this to memory. If he had the chance, he would definitely get her a better Spirit Energy Pearl. Not just to make more immortal crystals, but because Spirit Energy Pearls were very beneficial to Snowy’s growth.

Yang Ye played with Snowy for a while and returned to the outside world.

Suddenly, Nansi Yin said, “We’ve arrived!”

Yang Ye stopped and looked up. He could faintly see a huge gorge around 3km ahead. It was surrounded by tall mountains of all sorts of shapes and sizes. They were scattered all around the area, and they seemed very messy!

Diving Cove Gorge!

“Be careful!” Nansi Yin said, “According to my knowledge, the devil race, demon race, and even some other races will be coming. In short, it’s best to be careful. Because the discovery of a Sage Ruins has great implications, and the geniuses of all races will definitely not give up such an opportunity!”

Yang Ye nodded, “Let’s go!”

Nansi Yin obstructed Yang Ye’s path, “You don’t seem to really care!”

Yang Ye replied, “I won’t underestimate my opponents.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he walked around her and continued forward.

“What a weirdo!” She shook her head and followed him.

It didn’t take long for them to arrive within the gorge, and figures were flashing through it from time to time.

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings. They were surrounded by mountains. In the end, he looked towards a distant mountain wall. There was a faint golden light coming from there. Besides that, there was a trace of an aura seeping out from there.

“A Sage’s aura!” Suddenly Nansi Yin said, “Diving Cove Gorge was once just an ordinary place. But one day, a phenomenon appeared here, and it drew the attention of countless experts. After that, they noticed that there was a Sage Ruins here. The shaman race tried to stop any information from getting out, but it was too late.”

Yang Ye asked, “How do we get in?”

She shook her head, “I don’t know.”

Yang Ye felt speechless.

“Let’s just wait!” Nansi Yin looked towards the mountain wall in the distance, “There should have been a formation here, but it has clearly vanished. So, the Sage’s aura is leaking. It may have been done intentionally by the Sage. So, it won’t take long before the hidden door into the ruins will appear on its own.”

Yang Ye nodded, and then he sat cross-legged on the ground, “Then let’s wait!”

Nansi Yin sat by Yang Ye’s side. She was about to speak when she suddenly looked towards the distance. A group was walking over slowly.

They were led by Bei Cangyue!

Bei Cangyue grinned at Nansi Yin, and then she withdrew her gaze and led her group to another side.

Nansi Yin withdrew her gaze and said, “I think they won’t let the matter rest that easily!”

Yang Ye spoke indifferently, “Are you afraid?”

Nansi Yin shook her head, “She won’t dare to kill me, but she definitely dares to kill you.”

Yang Ye suddenly asked, “Why doesn’t she?”

Nansi Yin chuckled, “My Nansi Clan isn’t that easy to bully. Right, have you heard of the Nansi Clan?”

Yang Ye shook his head.

Nansi Yin’s face froze, and then she shook her head, “I’ll let you see for yourself if we have the chance!”

Time trickled by, and more and more people arrived. The atmosphere here grew more and more heavy and tense.

“I wonder who’ll get the Sage’s inheritance this time!” Nansi Yin suddenly said, “A Sage’s inheritance isn’t just inheriting the Sage’s mantle, there’ll be many treasures. Hehe, those are awesome. You know the Sovereign of Man, right? The Sovereign of Man’s holy sword was gained from an inheritance like this.”

Yang Ye looked up towards the distant mountain wall. Instead of the Sage’s inheritance, he was even more curious about a Sage’s strength.

Suddenly, Yang Ye looked up towards the distance. He wasn’t the only one. Many others had done the same at this moment. A man was walking slowly in their direction.

He wore a white robe, had hair that hung down to his shoulders, and carried a platinum spear on his back. The reason everyone was looking at him was that he was emanating his aura. It was extraordinarily powerful, and it made countless people here feel quite a bit of pressure!

Aura!

Imposing aura!

Yang Ye glanced at the man and withdrew his gaze.

Nansi Yin said, “He’s very strong!”

Yang Ye nodded. He couldn’t deny that the man was very strong, much stronger than Xiu Shanyue whom he fought earlier. However, Yang Ye noticed many stronger auras hiding in the shadows. Those experts who were hiding in the shadows were the true experts!

Normally, the stronger a person was, the less attention they tried to attract. Because they’d seen the world, and they knew that there were many stronger existences in the world. So, they kept a low profile.

Meanwhile, the man with a spear on his back walked over to Bei Cangyue, and then he cupped his fist towards her, “Young Miss Cangyue, I’m not too late, right?”

Bei Cangyue smiled, “Gu Suyan, tell me the truth. Why are you so late?”

Gu Suyan smiled and replied, “I encountered a few ignorant Enlightened Realm experts on the way here. That’s why I’m late!”

“Oh?” Bei Cangyue said, “Let me guess. All of them have vanished forever, right?”

Gu Suyan smiled, “I’m sorry to say that one of the four escaped.”

It meant that he’d killed three Enlightened Realm experts!

Bei Cangyue smiled, “Congratulations, your strength has grown again!”

Gu Suyan grinned, “It’s nothing worth mentioning. There are countless young geniuses. Besides the Sage Ruins, I’m also here to experience the strength of even more monstrous geniuses.”

Bei Cangyue said, “You’ll get your wish.”

Crack!

Suddenly, a crack resounded from the mountain wall in the distance.

At this moment, everyone looked up at it, and then it slowly split open towards both sides. The crack gradually grew larger and larger, and it didn’t take long for a passageway that was around 300m wide to appear before everyone.

A moment of silence ensued, and then figures started shooting into the passageway.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye stood up slowly and said, “Let’s head in too!”

Nansi Yin nodded, and she walked towards it with Yang Ye. However, it didn’t take long for them to stop because Bei Cangyue’s group appeared by their side.

Bei Cangyue sized up Yang Ye and Nansi Yin, and then she smiled, “While the Sage’s inheritance is great, your lives are more important. What do you think?”

It was a threat!

Nansi Yin frowned when she heard Bei Cangyue. She was about to speak when Yang Ye suddenly said, “Let’s go!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he continued off into the distance.

Nansi Yin glanced coldly at Bei Cangyue and followed him.

They ignored her!

Bei Cangyue’s face was quite gloomy. Because Yang Ye was openly ignoring her!

Suddenly, Gu Suyan spoke abruptly, “Cangyue, you have enmity with them?”

Bei Cangyue spoke indifferently, “Not really. We were just tricked by them. But it’s fine. We can take revenge in the future!”

“In the future?” Gu Suyan chuckled, “How can you wait until the future for something like this? Cangyue, you’re really too kindhearted and nice. Of course, it’s a very good thing. However, you should be ruthless when it’s needed. Otherwise, others will think that you’re easy to bully!”

Bei Cangyue remained silent.

Meanwhile, Gu Suyan suddenly patted her on the shoulder and smiled, “Watch! I’ll help you vent!”

As soon as he finished speaking, his figure flashed and appeared before Yang Ye and Nansi Yin.

Gu Suyan sized up Yang Ye and Nansi Yin, and then he smiled, “Cangyue is kindhearted, and she doesn’t like to make a fuss about things. However, it doesn’t represent that others can do as they please. No matter what you’ve done, I don’t want to know anything about it. Now, go over to her, kneel down, and admit your mistakes. If she forgives you, then I’ll let you live. Otherwise…”

Suddenly, Yang Ye interrupted Gu Suyan and said, “Brains!”Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Gu Suyan frowned, “What?”

Yang Ye walked over to Gu Suyan and looked him in the eyes, “A brain is a good thing! I hope you have one!”

Gu Suyan was stunned speechless.
