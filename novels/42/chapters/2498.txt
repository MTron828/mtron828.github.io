Chapter 2499 – Is it Wrong to be Ugly?

Mo Ya and the others' faces turned gloomy when they heard the bald man. Clearly, the man was trying to take advantage of this situation!

At this moment, all of them revealed undisguised rage.

But the bald man and his companion ignored their rage and just gazed at Yang Ye with undisguised greed and ridicule.

A fat sheep!

They’d paid a lot of money to get into the city, and they finally found someone rich, so how could they not take a good chunk of meat from this fat sheep?

Yang Ye shook his head and sighed.

This was a common occurrence. Taking a step back wouldn’t give you peace, it would just make the other party take one step forward and try to take a yard! When you wanted to avoid trouble, the other would think you were afraid and easy to bully instead!

That was how many people acted. They had this problem that if they were given a little face, their smiles would widen and brighten up.

Yang Ye shook his head, gazed at the bald man, and then waved his right hand. Over a dozen World Crystals appeared before him.

Yang Ye cracked a smile, “Come take it then!”

The bald man’s eyes narrowed slightly, “Alright!”

He was about to stretch out his hand, but right when it had been stretched out to Yang Ye, a ray of sword energy flashed.

Hiss!

The bald man’s right arm fell off his shoulder!

Blood sprayed like a fountain!

However, this wasn’t the end of it. A sword pressed against the bald man’s forehead. It pierced half an inch deep, causing a strand of blood to spray from the bald man and instantly cover his face!

Everyone here was stunned!

Suddenly, Yang Ye waved his right hand, and a ray of light took the bald man’s left hand too.

Yang Ye severed it with such ease!

At this moment, the bald man was armless!

Yang Ye cracked a smile, “Go on! Why aren’t you taking it?”

The bald man stared at Yang Ye, “I didn’t expect to encounter someone like you. Kill me if you want!”

Yang Ye waved his right hand, and the spatial ring on the severed arm flew over into his grasp. There were two World Crystals and more than 200 Divine Crystals within it. Obviously, the bald man had done quite a bit of robbing!

Suddenly, the man with the saber attacked, and his saber slashed down at Yang Ye. He was clearly trying to save the bald man.

However, a sword suddenly blasted the man flying and nailed him to the city walls.

The man gazed at his saber with shock. His saber was in countless pieces now.

An absolutely powerful attack!

Mo Ya and the others were extremely shocked too. They knew Yang Ye was very strong when he used the sword, but they hadn’t expected him to be this strong! All of them were Three World Realm experts! Moreover, they had clearly experienced countless battles and were definitely formidable in battle!

However, they hadn’t been able to resist a single attack!

“This is a misunderstanding!” Suddenly, a voice came from the side, and then a man walked over with a folding hand in his grasp. The man walked over to Yang Ye’s group and smiled, “These are my friends. As far as I’m concerned, it was all just a misunderstanding. So let’s just let it go, alright?”

“A misunderstanding?” Yang Ye gazed at the man and smiled, “I think it may be a misunderstanding too. Right, your friends took 20 World Crystals from me. Tell them to return those crystals, alright?”

20 World Crystals!

Mo Ya and the others had quite weird expressions on their faces. They were shocked that Yang Ye was actually trying to rob them at a time like this!

The man with the folding fan’s eyes narrowed slightly when he heard Yang Ye, but the smile on his face remained. However, it was quite ghastly and cold now.

“Nonsense!” Meanwhile, the bald man suddenly cursed, “You’re fucking saying that I took…”

Hiss!

Suddenly, his head flew up into the air!

Blood sprayed like a fountain!

He was dead!

Everyone here was stunned!

They hadn’t expected Yang Ye to kill the bald man!

The smile on the man’s face turned utterly ghastly and cold now!

While the bald man had lost his head, his soul had escaped his body at the critical moment. But Yang Ye still refused to spare him. Yang Ye was about to attack when the man with the folding fan suddenly unfurled the fan, and then a wave of powerful energy surged out from the fan.

The Four World Realm!

Yang Ye swung his sword.

Hiss!

The energy was instantly sliced into bits, and the man himself was blasted to the city walls.

Yang Ye flicked a ray of sword energy over and nailed the bald man’s soul to the wall.

At this moment, the bald man was truly afraid!

Because if he lost his soul, then he would really vanish from this world.

He was about to say something, but Yang Ye didn’t give him the chance and obliterated his soul with a ray of sword energy!

He was truly gone!

The man with the folding fan had an extremely unsightly expression on his face, “Aren’t you going a little too far?”

“Too far?” Yang Ye gazed at the man, “I’m in a very bad mood right now. Three breaths of time, that’s all you have. If you’re still here after that, I’ll kill you too. Forget it, I’ll just kill you.”

A ray of light flashed once he finished speaking.

The man’s expression changed drastically. He took a step back and tossed the fan forward. In an instant, the fan started expanding as it flew. However, it hadn’t even revealed its might when a ray of sword energy slashed it into bits!

The sword shot forward and instantly pierced the man’s forehead.Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

The man’s figure stiffened on the spot, and disbelief filled his eyes.

Weren’t we still negotiating? Why did he suddenly attack? How could he be so strong?

That was the last thought in his mind, and he died with endless questions.

The biggest question he had was that Yang Ye had been planning to rob them, and he couldn’t figure out why Yang Ye had suddenly attacked to kill instead!

He couldn’t figure it out even until he took his last breath!

After he killed the man with the folding fan, Yang Ye launched another attack that instantly took the head of the man with the saber!

All three of them were dead!

Mo Ya and the others gazed at Yang Ye with slight fear. At this moment, he was emanating an extremely oppressive and sharp desire to kill!

He was quite terrifying at this moment!

A few breaths of time later, Yang Ye gradually calmed down, and then he waved his hand and took the spatial rings of the other two. He glanced through them and noticed 5 and 3 World Crystals respectively! There were many other things in their spatial rings, but not one was up to his standards!

He had either Divine Treasures or Super Divine Treasures, so most treasures were truly beyond his notice!

Yang Ye put the rings away and gazed at the others, “Let’s head inside!”

Lu Yunxian spoke solemnly, “Trouble may come because of this!”

Yang Ye grinned, “It’s fine, I’ll deal with it!”

He glanced up at this point. There was a woman at a corner of the city walls. She was seated on it with her legs dangling down while eating cucumber.

She glanced at him and didn’t say anything.

Yang Ye didn’t say anything either. He moved his gaze away and entered the city with the others.

The woman took another bite of her cucumber and looked off into the distance. It didn’t take long for a few people to appear there. It was Ye Xuan’s group.

The woman leaped off the wall. Ye Xuan immediately ran over when she saw the woman, “Sister!”

The woman was the eldest young miss of the Ye Clan and its next patriarch, Ye Zhibei!

Ye Zhibei sized up Ye Xuan, and then she gazed at the others behind Ye Xuan. They hurriedly bowed respectfully, “Eldest Young Miss!”

Ye Zhibei took another bite of cucumber and spoke indifferently, “What are you doing here?”

Cold sweat instantly emerged on their faces!

Only those who’d come in contact with her knew how terrifying she was!

Meanwhile, Ye Xuan suddenly said, “Father asked them to come with me and temper themselves.”

Ye Zhibei said indifferently, “Go back!”

Ye Xuan was quite embarrassed by this, and the others had unsightly expressions on their faces.

Meanwhile, Ye Zhibei took another bite, “Must I repeat myself?”

The black robed men shot pleading gazed at Ye Xuan.

Ye Xuan hesitated for a moment and said, “Sister, we can only head inside now. If they leave, the others at home will definitely ridicule them. Don’t worry, they won’t cause trouble for you. They will do everything you say!”

Ye Zhibei glanced at her, “They will die here.”

Meanwhile, a black robed man hurriedly said, “Eldest Young Miss, we’re not afraid of death. It’s true. So, please give us a chance. If we do die, we will have no regrets!”

Ye Zhibei fell silent and seemed to be thinking.

Meanwhile, Ye Xuan hurriedly changed the topic, “Big Sis, I met a sword cultivator earlier, he was very strong!”

Ye Zhibei asked, “A sword cultivator in a green robe?”

Ye Xuan hurriedly nodded, “That’s him. Right, how do you know?”

She replied indifferently, “He just went inside!”

Ye Xuan raised a finger, “He almost killed me with a single attack earlier. If I didn’t have that Divine Treasure father gave me, I wouldn’t be able to see you again!”

“Kill you?” Ye Zhibei frowned, and the remaining cucumber in her hand was obliterated!

Ye Xuan nodded and said, “Don’t be angry. Because he isn’t an outsider, he’s from our clan!”

Ye Zhibei’s frown deepened, “Our clan?”

Ye Xuan nodded, “He’s an illegitimate child from a branch family, and he’s in the Ancient Sword Sect right now.”

An illegitimate child!

Ye Zhibei asked, “Are you sure?”

Ye Xuan nodded, “I am.”

Actually, she wasn’t very sure. However, she had no choice in order to divert her sister’s attention away from the black robed men.

Ye Zhibei fell silent for a long time and said, “Let’s go inside first.”

They turned around and walked into the city.

When they arrived before the city gates, a middle aged man appeared before them. He glanced at the corpses in the distance and gazed at Ye Zhibei. His expression changed slightly when he saw her, and then he said, “Young Miss Ye!”

Ye Zhibei nodded slightly and was about to head inside when the middle aged man asked, “Young Miss Ye, do you know who did that?”

Ye Zhibei replied indifferently, “You’re asking me?”

The middle aged man nodded, “Yes!”

She glanced at him, “You’re too ugly, so I don’t want to tell you!”

She led the others into the city once she finished speaking.

The middle aged man’s face was quite unsightly.

Is it wrong to be ugly?
