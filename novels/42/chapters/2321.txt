Chapter 2322 – Chopping Meat!

All along the way, Bai Zhixian shot quite a few furtive glances at the small Primal Demon. It remained very quiet and just followed behind Wang Erya. It didn’t say anything or do anything. However, it frequently moved closer toward Yang Ye.

Actually, she didn’t really want the Primal Demon to come with them because she didn’t know what it wanted.

There was definitely a reason why it was following them.

However, she still allowed it in the end. It was mainly because allowing it to follow them was better than it trying to follow them on its own.

It didn’t take long for her to stop.

There was a glowing door not too far away from them, and Eternal Border was on the other side.

Bai Zhixian glanced at Yang Ye, “No matter what awaits, we’ll face it together.”

She took Yang Ye’s hand and walked toward the door.

Meanwhile, Wang Erya exclaimed, and then she tapped her right foot down and transformed into an afterimage that entered the door.

Bai Zhixian’s expression changed drastically, “Erya…”

She hurriedly pulled Yang Ye along and charged into the door.

The Primal Demon gazed at the door and was slightly hesitant and fearful. A short while later, it glanced at the surroundings, and then walked slowly toward the door. When it almost arrived before the door, it suddenly sped up and shot straight through it.

At an ethereal area, an ethereal figure was on one knee while one of its hands was pressed on its chest.

The ethereal figure had been holding this same posture for a very, very long time.

A long time passed before it slowly removed the hand on its chest. In an instant, a strand of blood seeped out.

There was a small hole made from a sword there!

A long time passed once again before it spoke softly, “What a powerful sword…”

Crack!

It seemed like something had shattered in the world, and the entire Eternal Secret Realm shook violently.

The ethereal figure was the spirit of the seal, and the seal around Eternal Secret Realm had weakened slightly again.

At a boundless mountain range in the rear mountains of Eternal Village, furious howls resounded from time to time, “Sprite Progenitor, Sprite Progenitor…” The voice carried boundless rage and displeasure!

It was Nine Hells Emperor.

A Sprite Progenitor, one that hadn’t matured fully. What did that represent? It represented endless possibilities!

However, Nine Hells Emperor clearly wouldn’t just let this go. Especially now that the seal had weakened slightly against…

…

Eternal Border.

The experts of the six clans were still here in Eternal Immortal City, but their leader had changed from Wang Yun to Wang Yanxian.

Wait!

The Immortal Estate and the experts of the six clans were waiting for Yang Ye to come back outside!

This time, they had dispatched all their experts, and their objective was to annihilate Yang Ye, truly annihilate him without giving him the slightest chance to survive.

7 True Void Realm experts and 17 True Dao Realm experts against a single Progenitor!

It was a situation that had never occurred in the past!

Time trickled by.

Suddenly, the portal trembled, and the experts here immediately opened their eyes. Everyone gazed at the portal!

Especially Shiyuan Xing, there was undisguised killing intent in his eyes.

The Shiyuan Clan would never have peace while Yang Ye was alive!

Just like that, they watched as a petite figure flashed out from there.

All of them were stunned by the sight of this figure.

It wasn’t Yang Ye!

It was Wang Erya. Wang Erya shook her head forcefully and muttered, “What the heck! I feel so dizzy!”

Meanwhile, Wang Yanxian suddenly said, “Who are you?”

Wang Erya shook her head and ignored Wang Yanxian. At this moment, her head was droning, and it felt terrible.

Wang Yanxian’s eyes narrowed slightly. He waved his right hand, and a blast of wind slammed at her. It was extremely swift and instantly slammed against her. However, Wang Erya was completely unharmed. Conversely, the wind had been dispersed instead!

The expressions of everyone here changed from the sight of this.

Meanwhile, Wang Erya looked at Wang Yanxian, “Why did you hit me?”

Wang Yanxian’s eyes narrowed slightly, “Who are you?”

Wang Erya suddenly raised her sleeves and said, “I asked you why!”

Killing intent flashed through Wang Yanxian’s eyes, and then he tapped his finger at her. A strand of powerful energy rippled out from the tip of his finger, and it instantly arrived in front of Wang Erya.

Wang Erya was furious!

She raised her hand and swung a punch!

Bang!

The energy was instantly blasted apart, and then she appeared in front of Wang Yanxian and swung another punch!

Wang Yanxian’s expression instantly changed when he saw her blast apart his attack. He knew he’d really underestimated his opponent! So, he immediately started taking her seriously, and a silver spear appeared in his grasp. A moment later, it shot toward her fist like rumbling thunder.

As soon as they collided, Wang Yanxian’s expression changed drastically.

Everyone watched with astonishment as the silver spear cracked open, and Wang Yanxian was pushed back repeatedly.

Everyone was shocked by this and gazed at Wang Erya!

Meanwhile, Wang Erya patted her palms together and glared at Wang Yanxian, “You think I’m easy to bully?”

Wang Yanxian wiped off the blood on the corner of his mouth and gazed at her, “Who are you?!”

Wang Erya grunted coldly, “Why do you care?”

Gloominess flashed through Wang Yanxian’s eyes, “Do you know who I am? I’m an elder of the Immortal Estate. Do you want to become enemies with my Immortal Estate?”

“The Immortal Estate?” Wang Erya frowned slightly and said, “What the heck is that? Is it strong?”

Wang Yanxian felt speechless.

Wang Erya ignored him and gazed at the door of light, “Why aren’t they here yet?”

Suddenly, the door of light shook, and everyone’s gazes were drawn to it.

In the city, a woman with a huge sword on her back suddenly stood up, and she gazed at the door of light.

Time trickled by, and then two figures appeared here.

The atmosphere here instantly became tense when they saw these figures clearly.

It was because they were Yang Ye and Bai Zhixian!

Yang Ye!

A solemn expression instantly appeared on Bai Zhixian’s face when she saw them. She’d guessed that there would be experts here, but she hadn’t expected so many of them!

7 True Void Realm and 17 True Dao Realm experts!

It could be said that practically all the experts of the six clans were here!

“You’re finally here!” Meanwhile, Wang Erya ran over to them and grumbled, “That passageway made me so dizzy. Right…”

She pointed at Wang Yanxian, “That fellow attacked me earlier!”

Bai Zhixian glanced at Wang Yanxian, and she said, “I didn’t expect the Immortal Estate to be here too!”

“Of course we are!” Wang Yanxian laughed coldly, “Bai Zhixian, I’m really curious. Who gave you the gall to get together with Yang Ye? What? Is White Emperor City tired of living, or are you tired of living? You…”

Suddenly, Yang Ye vanished on the spot, and he was in front of Wang Yanxian when he appeared again. He was so swift that everyone here hadn’t been able to react to it.

Wang Yanxian was shocked. He overlapped his palms and slammed them forward swiftly.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye drew the saber on his back and swung it down.

Boom!

Wang Yanxian was blasted away, over 10km away. In the end, he slammed against the city walls, and that part of the walls collapsed with him.

Bang!

Wang Yanxian slammed into the ground and blasted open a deep hole there.

Wang Yanxian’s entire body seemed like it had fallen apart, or it should be said that while he was still alive, his meridians were shattered. Moreover, his meridians weren’t the only thing that had shattered, all his bones throughout his body had shattered as well!

He’d succeeded at stopping Yang Ye’s attack just now, but the price was that both his bones and meridians had shattered!

Besides that, his entire body was like cracked glass. While it hadn’t shattered completely, it was covered in cracks, so blood was ceaselessly seeping out of them. In an instant, he was lying in a pool of blood!

Everyone here was stunned by this scene!

A saber! Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Didn’t Yang Ye use the sword?

This same question had appeared in the minds of all the experts from the six clans! Of course, the bigger question in their minds was when Yang Ye had become so strong?

One strike!

Yang Ye had completely crippled Wang Yanxian with just one strike!

Wang Yanxian was a True Void Realm expert! When did True Void Realm experts become so weak?

Everyone gazed at Yang Ye, and they felt that the man before them felt so unreal right now!

Wang Erya gulped, and then she returned to Bai Zhixian’s side. She knew that it was better to offend Yang Ye than ever offend Bai Zhixian, because doing so would make him go berserk! In Eternal Village, even her grandfather would be absolutely polite to Bai Zhixian, and even Butcher and the slovenly old man did the same. They couldn’t speak loudly to her because if they did, Yang Ye would immediately draw his saber!

Suddenly, Yang Ye appeared in front of Wang Yanxian, and then he swung his saber down at Wang Yanxian’s head.

Wang Yanxian’s eyes almost split apart from terror, “NO!”

Hiss!

His body was chopped into two, and blood sprayed in all directions!

However, that wasn’t the end of it!

Yang Ye swung the saber again!

Hiss!

Wang Yanxian’s corpse was chopped into four pieces!

Blood sprayed once more!

But Yang Ye still didn’t stop and chopped again…

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!

The sound of chopping resounded incessantly!

Wang Erya gulped, “H-He’s imitating Butcher chopping meat…”
