Chapter 1955 – Lousy Trash!

Yang Ye looked up, and he saw something appear in the darkness outside the city.

It wasn’t big. Its head was like a hawk, its body like a dragon, and it had a pair of claws and wings.

While it wasn’t big, its wings were quite big, and they were almost five times larger than its body. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“Wyverns!” Qin Chuan said, “These fellows are formidable!”

Yang Ye was about to speak when the Wyvern suddenly appeared above the city wall. It was so swift that even Yang Ye was shocked by it.

Fast!

Extremely fast!

Even with his reaction speed, he’d been almost unable to react to it!

However, the youths on the city wall weren’t shocked by its speed, and their speed was extremely swift too. As soon as it descended upon the city wall, one of them had suddenly appeared behind the Wyvern. In an instant, a spear stabbed its back!

Yang Ye spoke softly, “He’s fast!”

“There are those who are even faster!” Qin Chuan smiled, “But I’m quite curious. We’re so fast because we fight these fellows every single day, and they forced us to get faster. But why are you so fast?”

My speed? Yang Ye chuckled, “I was forced to get faster too!”

Besides killing, his speed had one other use, and it was to flee. He’d never lacked problems in his life, and he’d spent practically every moment of his life being chased by someone. However, it had its advantages, and it was that it forced him to grow stronger!

At most times, people are forced to become better!

Three Wyverns had appeared on the city walls, and the five people there were fighting them.

At this moment, Yang Ye finally understood why the Wyverns were so feared!

They weren’t just swift, their defenses were shocking too. It could be said that their defenses weren’t any weaker to his current physical defenses. Of course, they couldn’t compare to him if he used the Gold Form.

Five against three, yet they were still at a disadvantage!

Yang Ye gazed at Qin Chuan, “Should we help?”

Qin Chuan shook his head.

Yang Ye asked, “Why?”

“Pride!” Qin Chuan smiled, “Every single person here is extremely proud. While we’re from various different races, besides A’Man, everyone else doesn’t acknowledge anyone else as stronger. So, if we go help them now, they will definitely not be able to accept it. Because no one helped us when we took the night watch!”

Pride!

Yang Ye looked up at the city walls. While the youths were being suppressed by the three Wyverns and two of them were even bleeding, they were growing stronger as the battle progressed!

Quality!

The quality of these geniuses was much greater than the geniuses in the outside world!

Wyverns had appeared over all the other sections of the city walls. However, they were stopped by the experts on the walls.

Just like that, time trickled by, and the battle continued until dawn.

When the first glimmer of dawn arrived, the Wyverns vanished into the sky.

At this moment, all the experts on the city walls fell weakly to the ground and were panting.

They were exhausted!

They were truly exhausted after fighting all night!

A’Man suddenly said, “Come here!”

The people on the city walls shuddered and went over to her.

She glanced at them. At this moment, most of them were injured, and some were even severely injured. One had lost an arm, and another had lost a leg.

But none of them had lost their lives!

A’Man gazed at the man who’d lost an arm and said, “Are you an idiot? Don’t you know how to dodge when it attacks you? Did you have to go head-on against it and risk everything? Just look at your own body! How strong is it?!”

That man cracked a smile and remained silent.

“Smile! That’s all you know how to do!” A’Man glared at him, “When you face someone stronger, you must learn to dodge. You take a step back to advance better, understand?”

The man hurriedly nodded, “Understood!”

A’Man flicked two immortal crystals to him, “Take it and recuperate!”

The man’s expression changed slightly, and then he hurriedly shook his head, “I don’t need it. I…”

A’Man glared at him, “Want to get a beating?”

The man intended to say more, but A’Man suddenly said, “Su Yin, stop acting like a little girl. Just take it if I give it to you and heal your injuries.”

As she spoke, she flicked two immortal crystals to all the other heavily injured, “The same goes for all of you!”

They exchanged glances. In the end, they cupped their fists to her and spoke in unison, “Thank you, Big Sis!”

“Big Sis!” Suddenly, a man in a white robe stepped forward from behind A’Man. Needless to say, he was quite striking when compared to the others. Because most of them were injured and in an extremely sorry state.

But he wasn’t in a sorry state at all. There wasn’t even a trace of blood on his white robe. It could be said that he’d formed a striking contrast with the others.

A’Man gazed at the white robed man, and he chuckled, “Big Sis, see, I’m injured too. So, can I have two immortal crystals as well?”

“You’re injured?” A’Man sized up the white robed man, and then she waved her fist at him, “Really? Let me check!”

As she spoke, she started walking slowly in his direction.

The white robed man’s expression changed from the sight of this, and he hurriedly spoke seriously, “Not at all. Big Sis, I don’t want any immortal crystals, I’m serious! I don’t want any!”

A’Man glanced at him and spoke indifferently, “Yu Jing, not bad, huh? You’ve grown a little stronger again.”

Yu Jing chuckled, “We’re all trash before you, Big Sis. Trash! We’re nothing worth mentioning!”

“Don’t even try that!” A’Man glared at Yu Jing, “I have something I need you to do. Something happened between us and the Devil Cave, so I think that they won’t let the matter rest. You go watch them and see if they do anything. Come back if they aren’t doing anything; but if they are, then come back as well. Don’t act rashly. Otherwise, you’ll have toilet duty every day!”

Yu Jing’s face instantly became extremely unsightly as he seemed to have thought of something.

The others instantly started roaring with laughter when they heard this.

Yang Ye gazed at Qin Chuan, and the latter smiled, “He’s Yu Jing, from the sky race, and he’s a clean freak. He can’t tolerate even the slightest dirt.”

Yang Ye asked, “So?”

Qin Chuan chuckled, “When he just arrived here, he acted just like he did in the outside world. He was insufferably arrogant. Not only did he look down on us, he looked down on A’Man too. He asked her for a one on one battle and wanted to become the leader of Sky Residence City. After that… he was utterly bashed up!”

Yang Ye was stunned speechless.

Qin Chuan continued, “Seriously, a loss is a loss. It wouldn’t have been a big deal if he admitted defeat. But he just refused to admit defeat, and he even cursed A’Man and called her a fatty… In the end, she bashed him up for an entire eight hours. She bashed him up the entire day, and she even made him wash the toilets in the end. Hahaha!”

“Qin Chuan! What are you laughing at?!” Suddenly, Yu Jing gazed at Qin Chuan, “Were you any better? Someone was hung up on the city walls for three days and three nights, and…”

“Shut up!” Qin Chuan glared at Yu Jing, “You bastard! Are you asking for a one on one fight?!”

“You think I’m afraid of you?!” Yu Jing was about to attack, but A’Man suddenly said, “What? You two want to fight? Come! My hands are getting itchy too! Come fight me!”

Both of their faces stiffened when they heard her.

Meanwhile, Yu Jing spoke seriously, “Big Sis, I’ll go watch the Devil Cave right now!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he vanished into the sky.

The others in the surroundings started roaring with laughter again.

A’Man glanced at them and said, “I’m leaving. Don’t cause trouble while I’m gone!”

She vanished on the spot once she finished speaking.

Qin Chuan laughed bitterly, “Actually, I was taught a lesson when I just arrived!”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Why?”

Qin Chuan replied, “Just think about it. Which one of us wasn’t a renowned figure in the outside world? We were so dazzling out there. But once we arrived here, we had to acknowledge a woman—who’s at our age—as our leader. Tell me, would you be willing to accept that?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “I wouldn’t!”

Qin Chuan smiled, “Yes, none of us were willing, and then we suffered. Do you know how many moves I lasted against her?”

Yang Ye shook his head.

Qin Chuan said, “Less than six, and it was even under the condition that she wasn’t using her full strength. She wouldn’t have kept bashing me up if I just admitted defeat, but I wasn’t thinking straight then, and I did the same as that idiot. I cursed her, and then… and then she hung me up on the city wall…”

Yang Ye looked up at the sky, “How strong is she?”

Qin Chuan shook his head, “I don’t know, but there’s one fellow who does!”

Yang Ye asked, “Who?”

Qin Chuan pointed towards a black clothed man who was seated cross-legged not too far away from them. The man had a broken sword without its sheath tied to his waist.

Yang Ye noticed that the black clothed man had just a single arm.

Yang Ye asked, “Who is he?”

Qin Chuan shook his head slightly, “I don’t know who he is. That fellow’s quite mysterious. Besides A’Man, he ignores everyone else here. We call him the Mad Saber because he’s a madman when it comes to cultivating and killing. Especially cultivating… Supposedly, he cut off an arm for his cultivation, and he even made himself deaf for it…”

Yang Ye was stunned speechless.
