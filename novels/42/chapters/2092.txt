Chapter 2093 – Attaining the Dao!

The beautiful woman gazed at Yang Ye for a long time and said, “Forgive me, I…”

Suddenly, Yang Ye vanished on the spot.

A speck of cold light appeared before her eyes.

It was a ray of sword energy!

It was the last thing she ever saw.

Yang Ye was behind her. He sheathed his sword slowly and left.

A strand of blood suddenly seeped out from her throat, and it gradually started flowing.

Yang Ye had decided to just let the matter rest. After all, he’d gained a million immortal crystals. But he hadn’t expected them to wish for the opposite. Since that was the case, he naturally intended to kill them all.

As he walked and walked, Yang Ye suddenly vanished on the spot. He didn’t want others to pay attention to him!

Yang Ye didn’t leave the city. He knew nothing about Void Continent, so he planned to gain a better understanding of it.

After inquiring in the city, Yang Ye gained a rough understanding of the continent.

There were a few famous organizations on the continent, and it was the organizations the beautiful woman had mentioned earlier. There were three sects and six factions, and the three sects were the strongest. They were the Sky Sect, Earth Sect, and Mortal Sect. Something worth mentioning was that they were actually part of the same organization, but for some reason, they had split into three sects. Besides that, the six factions couldn’t be underestimated either.

All of them may not possess progenitors, but they definitely had Sages.

In short, they couldn’t be underestimated!

Just like that, Yang Ye went all around Hidden Dragon City throughout the day, but he still wasn’t able to gain any information about the Bodhi Tree. Right when Yang Ye was about to leave, a few powerful auras shot up into the air from the city, and they vanished into the sky.

Yang Ye looked up at the sky and frowned, and then his figure transformed into a ray of light that followed them.

High above in the sky.

Yang Ye was very careful because all of them were Sages!

Around four hours later, they stopped, and so did Yang Ye. Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings. They were on an island. It wasn’t very huge, and it should be described as small. He could see the entire island with just a single glance.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye noticed that besides the experts in front of him, there were many other hidden and powerful auras throughout the island.

Sages!

Yang Ye was shocked. Obviously, they were all gathered here for the Bodhi Tree.

The Bodhi Tree is here? Yang Ye glanced at the island, but he didn’t notice anything but some demon beasts.

If only Snowy was here! Yang Ye shook his head. Snowy’s talent was locating treasures. If she was here, she may be able to sense the Bodhi Tree. Even if she couldn’t, she would be able to sense other treasures, and that was good too.

Unfortunately, the little fellow was still evolving.

Yang Ye didn’t act rashly and just hid in the shadows. Meanwhile, he suddenly sensed a familiar aura. He looked over and saw an old man and a robust woman flying over here!

Yang Ye was stunned when he saw her.

Because it was none other than A’Man whom he’d gotten to know in the Dead Dimension!

Yang Ye frowned, What’s she doing here?

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment, but he didn’t choose to go over. Because the old man by her side was a Sage, and he may be part of the Sage Alliance!

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts and focused on keeping himself completely hidden.

Time trickled by. More and more arrived here, and he sensed more than 20 powerful auras here!

All of them were Sages!

There were over 20 Sages on a single small island!

It could be said that just the aura they jointly emanated could obliterate this entire island!

Time passed slowly. A long time later, the entire island trembled, and then it started moving. It started moving slowly towards the right. In the beginning, it was only moving slightly, but in the end, it started speeding up progressively.

The people here moved along with the island.

Just like that, the island arrived in the boundless ocean, and it was still moving.

Yang Ye frowned. At this moment, he felt something was off.

What exactly was off?

He couldn’t put a finger on it. He just felt that something was off.

His intuition was usually extremely accurate, so he’d decided to stop following. However, the island suddenly stopped, and then pillars of water surged up around it and formed a barrier of water that completely surrounded the people hidden throughout the island.

Yang Ye’s heart sank.

Suddenly, the island shook violently, and then it started to transform. In the beginning, they couldn’t discern anything special about it, but they figured it out after a while.

It was a tree!

The island was actually a tree!

The Bodhi Tree?

Everyone hidden in the shadows couldn’t help but feel excited.

Is it the legendary Bodhi Tree?

15 minutes later, the entire island had transformed into a tree, a towering tree! There was bright green light flowing all around it, and the specks of light floated all over the tree. Besides that, its leaves were the color of moonlight. It simply seemed like they were made of moonlight. They were extremely beautiful.

Besides that, there was a faint strand of sweet fragrance drifting through the surroundings. Just a whiff of it made a person feel light, and it was simply impossible to describe with just words.

At this moment, practically everyone in the surroundings was certain that it was the Bodhi Tree of legend.

The Bodhi Tree had shown itself!

At this moment, the Sages here were the most excited. The Bodhi Tree represented that they could advance a step further.

While the Progenitor Realm was just a step away from the Sage Realm, it was a gap that was akin to life and death. Throughout the history of the large universe, there have been countless Sages, but how many progenitors have there been?

Perhaps there weren’t even more than 10!

As far as these Sages were concerned, it was absolutely difficult to take that final step on their own, so they placed their hopes on external forces.

The Bodhi Tree!

After all, the Buddhist Path’s progenitor had relied on the Bodhi Tree to attain the Progenitor Realm.

While they were excited and overjoyed, they were quite sensible and didn’t try to take it for themselves. What a joke! A divine treasure like this was something they had to curry favor with, it wasn’t something they could just take! They didn’t dare to try to take it either!

Suddenly, an old man appeared not too far from the tree. He bowed respectfully and said, “There’s no need to have your guard up. We don’t have any ill intent towards you, and we won’t allow anyone to have ill intent towards you.”

A short while passed before the pillars of water in the surroundings slowly vanished. The old man was inwardly happy when he witnessed this, and he said, “We only have one request, and it’s to sit below you and comprehend. I wonder if you’ll give us this opportunity?”

Why was the Bodhi Tree able to help others attain the Progenitor Realm? Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Others may not be aware of the reason, but these Sages were. The Bodhi Tree had such ability mainly because it had been born along with this universe. While it couldn’t be proved, one thing was certain, and it was that the Bodhi Tree had experienced the passage of countless universes, years, and civilizations…

The passage of time!

Sages like them needed such accumulation that had been completed over time. However, they had no idea how to accomplish it. The progenitors naturally had experience in it. However, why would those progenitors help them? Moreover, even if they did help, it wouldn’t make a difference. The reason was very simple, their own fortuitous encounters were different! For example, someone could take a certain path, but someone else may be unable to do so.

The Bodhi Tree!

If they could meditate and comprehend below the Bodhi Tree, they would be able to comprehend the passage of time that the Bodhi Tree had experienced.

The birth of the universe, its destruction, its rise, and its fall…

The old man slightly sounded like he was pleading, and there was a trace of humility in his voice too!

How could he not be excited when attaining the Dao was right before him?

Yang Ye was comparatively calm. As far as he was concerned, he couldn’t become a progenitor even if the tree let him comprehend everything! That was also why he remained the most sensible among everyone here.

Yang Ye sized up the tree, and then he slowly moved backward. It wasn’t that he felt there was definitely something wrong about this tree, and it was just out of habit. As far as he was concerned, it was best to have a way out of everything.

The old man gazing at the tree was seemingly visibly perturbed!

He didn’t dare guarantee that the tree would agree.

A short while later, the Bodhi Tree shook slightly, and then a wooden bench appeared before the old man.

The old man was overjoyed, and he hurriedly bowed respectfully to the tree, “Thank you. I’ll repay you a hundredfold if I succeed!”

Meanwhile, almost 20 others appeared before the tree. All of them bowed to it and spoke in unison, “Please allow us to as well!”

A moment of silence ensued, and then a wooden bench appeared before all of them. There was even one in front of Yang Ye.

Yang Ye gazed at the wooden bench, hesitated for a moment, and then planned to try sitting on it. As soon as he did that…
