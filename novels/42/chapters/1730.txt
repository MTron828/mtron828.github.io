It was none other than Yang Lianshuang! Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

But at this moment, her entire body was covered in mist, so others couldn’t discern her appearance at all.

Yang Ye asked, “What are you doing here?!”

She glanced at the heads behind Yang Ye and said, “What do you feel after killing so many?”

“Feel?” Yang Ye shrugged, “I don’t feel anything!”

She said, “Treating life like grass! That’s the type of person you are!”

Yang Ye shook his head, “I have my own principles when I kill. They died because they wanted to kill me. Those who kill should be prepared to be killed.”

“What about you?” She asked, “Are you prepared to be killed?”

Yang Ye shook his head and said, “You didn’t come here just to talk nonsense, right?”

She replied, “You don’t have to continue killing.”

“Why?” Yang Ye was puzzled, “I just got used to it!”

Her eyelids twitched, “Have you gotten addicted to killing?”

Addicted? Yang Ye was stunned. It didn’t take long for his face to turn gloomy. Because he noticed that he actually did feel a slight rush when he killed!

Have I really gotten addicted to killing?

If that’s true, then aren’t I a little abnormal?!

“Don’t worry too much about it!” Meanwhile, Yang Lianshuang said, “Your slaughter intent is at the Zenith Rank, so it’s very normal that you feel something different when you kill.”

Yang Ye felt speechless.

Yang Lianshuang continued, “I came here to tell you that you’ve achieved your objective. Presently, everyone in the medium universe knows your name. At this moment, there aren’t many who dare to come looking for you. Even the other seven clans have strictly prohibited their disciples from coming for you!”

Yang Ye nodded, “No wonder there haven’t been many in the last few days! What about the Yang Clan? Has the Yang Clan done anything?”

She fell silent.

Yang Ye asked, “What?”

She replied, “The Yang Clan is very quiet.”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “What do you mean?”

She replied, “It hasn’t made any moves. However, if I’m not wrong, one of the two ancestors of the Yang Clan has definitely emerged from his closed door cultivation.”

Yang Ye asked, “An expert at the 6th stage of the True Realm?”

Yang Lianshuang nodded, “Yang Xiao and the others dare not come for you, and they dare not touch me. It’s probably because they are waiting for that ancestor of the clan. Once he emerges from his closed door cultivation, it’ll be much easier for them to kill us.”

Yang Ye asked, “You’re no match for that ancestor of the Yang Clan?”

She glanced indifferently at him and said, “I can if I’m given another three years. But now… I’ll definitely die if I face him in battle! It’s the same for you!”

Yang Ye said, “What do you plan to do?”

Yang Lianshuang replied, “What else? Grow stronger. There’s another reason why I came to look for you, and it’s because I wanted to tell you that you can go to a place.”

Yang Ye asked, “What place?”

“An ancient ruin!” She continued, “A newly discovered ancient ruin!”

Yang Ye asked, “An ancient ruin?”

Yang Lianshuang nodded, “It was left behind by a true ancient cultivator.”

An ancient cultivator! Yang Ye fell silent. If he wasn’t wrong, the old man in Daoist’s robes was an ancient cultivator too. Yang Ye remained silent for a while before he gazed at Yang Lianshuang, “Who discovered it?”

“The eight clans!” Yang Lianshuang continued, “The eight clans have always been searching for ruins left behind by ancient cultivators, and they’ve been constantly launching expeditions, increasing their territory, and subduing worlds. Actually, their true objective is to find ruins left behind by those ancient cultivators!”

Yang Ye frowned, “They want to take the path that others have taken?”

Yang Lianshuang shook her head, “It’s not good to think like that. The path of cultivation is a never-ending path. Those ancient cultivators are ahead of us, and they know more than us. So, obtaining their inheritance will allow us to rely on their experience to perfect ourselves and improve ourselves. Otherwise, if we rely on ourselves to find our path, how long would it take? Take yourself as an example. The reason you were able to grow to such an extent in such a short while was probably because you obtained some sort of fortuitous encounter, right?”

A fortuitous encounter! Yang Ye nodded. If he hadn’t heard the conversation between the Unfettered One and Li Taibai, his Sword Dao would probably still be at the level it was once at. As for his strength, even if it had grown, it wouldn’t have grown to such an extent.

Meanwhile, Yang Lianshuang said, “Besides the inheritances of those ancient cultivators, there are the treasures they left behind. Many True Rank treasures we have were left behind by those ancient cultivators, and there even are treasures above the True Rank!”

Treasures above the True Rank!

Needless to say, Yang Ye was quite tempted. Even though he didn’t want to rely on treasures now, it was during normal times. But only a fool wouldn’t utilize treasures when facing enemies who weren’t normal!

Just like how he used the wooden sword when facing True Realm experts at the 3rd stage or above.

Yang Lianshuang said, “We can’t miss this opportunity. So, we must go.”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and shook his head, “I’m worried that the Yang Clan will act against Merak System!”

“You don’t have to worry about that!” She continued, “My people will protect it in secret. If Yang Xiao sends his forces there, my forces will act against them. So long as those two ancestors of the Yang Clan don’t interfere, my forces are able to deal with Yang Xiao’s forces!”

Yang Ye glanced at her and said, “You probably have many people supporting you in the Yang Clan, and your forces in the Yang Clan must be huge too. Why don’t you just rebel against them?”

Yang Lianshuang shook her head, “Even if I kill Yang Xiao, it wouldn’t make a difference unless I gain the approval of those two ancestors. However, they won’t agree to let me become the Yang Clan’s patriarch!”

Yang Ye asked, “So you intend to kill them?”

Yang Lianshuang replied with a question, “What else can I do?”

Yang Ye glanced at her and said, “Amazing!”

Yang Lianshuang didn’t say anything in response. She waved her right hand, and a map appeared before Yang Ye, “This is the location of the ancient ruin. The eight clans will open it in three days from now, and their disciples will be allowed to enter it. I believe that based on your ability, it shouldn’t be a problem for you to sneak in!”

She paused for a moment and continued, “Be careful there.”

Yang Ye gazed at her and asked, “It’s dangerous?”

“Of course!” Yang Lianshuang continued, “It’s extremely dangerous. You’ll know once you get there.” She turned around and vanished into the distance.

Once she left, Yang Ye stood silently on the spot for quite some time before turning around and entering the city.

The expressions of many on the city walls changed when they saw Yang Ye enter the city. Their eyes were filled with fear as they gazed at him, and they were absolutely afraid that he would draw his sword and kill them out of anger.

After he entered the city, Yang Ye vanished from their fields of vision.

Yang Ye went to the Grand Immortal Pavilion.

On the 4th floor, the mysterious woman said, “Young Master Yang, you’re not welcome in Sword Immortal City.”

Yang Ye nodded, “I’ll leave. But I’d like to ask for your help before I do.”

She replied, “I refuse!”

Yang Ye looked her in the eyes, “Then I won’t leave!”

She fell silent for a long time before she said, “So you’re going to be shameless?”

Yang Ye chuckled, “I just want a small favor from you. Seriously, it’s very simple.”

She said, “Tell me what it is!”

Yang Ye said, “I’ll leave Sword Immortal City. However, I hope that you don’t tell anyone that I’ve left.”

His goal was very simple. He wanted the Yang Clan to think that he was still in Sword Immortal City. In that way, the Yang Clan would be afraid, and it wouldn’t dare to rashly act against Merak System. Otherwise, once the Yang Clan found out that he was in the ancient ruin, it was very likely that they would send their forces to Merak System.

It wasn’t a matter of having trust in Yang Lianshuang. He didn’t really know her well, but he could sense that someone like her was extremely proud. Such a person would disdain to lie. However, he refused to place all his hopes on her.

So, he wanted the Yang Clan to think that he was still in Sword Immortal City!

The woman fell silent for a while, and then she said, “Alright!”

Yang Ye cupped his fist in the direction of the screen, “Thank you.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he turned around and walked away.

Suddenly, she said, “You’re leaving just like that?”

Yang Ye stopped and asked, “Why?”

She replied, “I helped you, so aren’t you supposed to owe me a favor?”

Yang Ye felt speechless.

In the end, Yang Ye agreed to owe her a favor, and then he snuck out of Sword Immortal City.

In the starry sky, Yang Ye found a safe place and entered the Primordial Pagoda.

Training!

His Split Second wasn’t at its limits at all, and it had a huge amount of space to grow. So, he intended to train and try his best to improve its strength!

There were no shortcuts when it came to training.

Yang Ye kept swinging his sword every single day. Over and over again. He only stopped when he couldn’t feel his arm, and then he used the Primordial Violet Energy to heal himself.

Just like that, Yang Ye trained madly every single day, and a month passed.

Throughout this month, Yang Ye only did a single thing all day, and it was swinging his sword! Swinging his sword incessantly!

Now, he could launch 12 attacks in a breath of time, and every single one of them had 21 attacks overlapped within them!

Even though it was merely just an extra one, the might of his attacks had increased by 30% at least. Moreover, launching 12 attacks in a breath of time represented that his speed had increased quite a bit.

This month of mad training hadn’t just improved both his strength and speed, he’d gained one other thing. He felt that his reaction speed had improved, and it was much faster than before!

In short, he’d improved tremendously in this month!

Yang Ye stopped training, and he left the Primordial Pagoda. Because the ancient ruin was being opened today!

Suddenly, Yang Ye frowned and entered the Primordial Pagoda. He went to the 2nd level because the Divine Yin Flame wanted to speak with him.

When he met the Divine Yin Flame, the Divine Yin Flame spoke solemnly, “I sense Master’s aura!”

The old man in Daoist’s robes!

Yang Ye was stunned speechless.
