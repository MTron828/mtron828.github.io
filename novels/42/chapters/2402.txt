Chapter 2403 – Fight!

Silence!

The entire Asura Hall instantly fell silent!

It had never suffered such a humiliation!

Actually, as far as Asura Hall was concerned, the fate of its junior hall master wasn’t that important. After all, he was a weakling, and he would have no status in Asura Hall if it wasn’t for the Hall Master.

However, no matter how they disdained him, they would never allow someone to kill him. Especially right in front of Asura Hall.

Face!

Yang Ye had killed their junior hall master right outside their door, and that was an absolute insult to Asura Hall!

An old man suddenly appeared outside Asura Hall. He glanced at Yang Ye, but his gaze quickly moved to Wu Ni.

He glanced at Wu Ni, and then he appeared in front of Wu Ni!

Unfathomable!𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

That was what Yang Ye sensed from the old man!

The old man glanced at Wu Ni, “What’s your name?”

“My name?” A wisp of disdain arose on the corners of Wu Ni’s mouth, “You’re not qualified to know my name!”

Wu Ni pressed his palm down.

The space around the old man instantly froze, it truly froze. At the same time, a wave of powerful energy raged through the area like a storm.

The old man’s eyes narrowed slightly, and then he stretched his right hand forward and waved it lightly. It caused the energy to immediately calm down, and then he pushed his palm forward.

Bang!

A wave of terrifying energy rippled out of the old man’s palm like the tide, and it locked onto Wu Ni. Moreover, there were no fluctuations in space as it passed through. It was like the energy was passing through space and instantly arriving before Wu Ni!

Yang Ye’s eyes lit up from the sight of this!

If he could grasp that technique, his flying swords would grow even more terrifying!

A wisp of disdain arose on Wu Ni’s lips, “World Shuttling. How laughable, it’s a technique I created, but you’re actually using it against me! How fucking laughable!”

Wu Ni raised his hand and slammed his fist forward.

Boom!

The old man’s energy was instantly dispersed. At the same time, he seemed like he’d been struck by a sledgehammer and was blasted over 3km away!

As soon as he stopped himself, a wisp of blood seeped out from the corner of his mouth. Moreover, that hand he used to attack Wu Ni shattered into bits!

A single punch!

Yang Ye glanced at Wu Ni, and he felt that the old man’s strength was really terrifying!

The old man glanced at his own arm, and then he looked up at Wu Ni, “Who are you?!”

This time, seriousness and fear filled the old man’s eyes!

Wu Ni glanced coldly at him, “I’m bullying you by acting against you, but that’s because your Asura Hall did it first.”

He pointed at An Nanjing and said, “I don’t want to waste time. Go on, tell me who sent people to kill this disciple of mine?”

The old man glanced at An Nanjing. At this moment, he knew why such a terrifying expert had come to Asura Hall.

The old man glanced at the junior hall master’s corpse, shook his head, and gazed at Wu Ni, “It was my Asura Hall’s mistake, and we’re willing to apologize to her. We…”

Suddenly, Wu Ni interrupted the old man, “I asked you who sent people to kill her. Didn’t you hear me?”

The old man laughed bitterly, “The culprit has already been killed by you!”

Wu Ni glanced at the area before him. There were three corpses there from experts he’d killed earlier!

Wu Ni gazed at An Nanjing, “If you’re unhappy, I’ll destroy the Asura Hall for you.”

The old man’s countenance turned quite pale when he heard this.

His collision with Wu Ni told him that the old man before him possessed the strength to destroy Asura Hall!

An Nanjing gazed at the old man. The old man hesitated for a moment and said, “My Asura Hall was at wrong, and we’re willing to give you a Divine Treasure as compensation. Please accept it!”

He tapped his finger forward while an unsightly expression covered his face, and then a pitch black armor appeared before An Nanjing.

The old man said, “This is the Asura Armor, the ultimate treasure of my Asura Hall. It can resist the full strength of Three World Realm experts, and ordinary Two World Realm experts can do nothing to it. You’re an extraordinary genius, and you’ll be invincible in your realm of cultivation once you possess this armor!”

An Nanjing glanced at it and took it.

The old man heaved a sigh of relief when he saw her accept it. If she refused, Asura Hall would have to fight to the death. While they had a very slim chance at victory, they would still try!

An Nanjing gazed at Wu Ni, and the latter nodded slightly, “Let’s go!”

Suddenly, Snowy emerged from Yang Ye’s chest. As soon as the little fellow made an appearance, everyone here gazed at her, and the old man was absolutely stunned!

A Sprite Progenitor!

How could he be unable to discern that the white little fellow before him was a Sprite Progenitor?

A Sprite Progenitor!

The old man’s hands were trembling!

If he wasn’t afraid of Wu Ni, he would have tried to take Snowy by now!

Suddenly, Snowy looked down at Asura Hall, and then her eyes lit up before she waved her paw.

Bang!

A huge white dragon shot up into the air!

The spirit vein!

Moreover, it was an immortal vein!

A real immortal vein!

The immortal vein glanced at everyone here, and then its gaze descended upon Snowy.

Snowy leaped up onto its head, and then grabbed its horn and urged it over to Yang Ye.

The white dragon hesitated for a moment but didn’t resist in the end.

Right when it was about to be dragged into the Primordial Pagoda, the old man finally recovered from his shock and quickly obstructed Snowy and the dragon’s path. He glanced at Snowy, hesitated for a moment, and asked, “W-What are you doing?”

Snowy blinked and patted the dragon’s head. She was saying that she was taking the dragon!

The old man hesitated and said, “This is Asura Hall!”

Asura Hall?

Snowy blinked, shook her head, and then patted the dragon’s head to say that the dragon belonged to her!

The old man laughed bitterly, “I-It really belongs to my Asura Hall!”

Snowy shook the dragon’s horn lightly, and then jumped off to the side. She pointed at the old man, and then pointed at herself. Obviously, she was asking who it wanted to stay with.

The white dragon glanced at the old man, glanced at Snowy, and then moved toward Snowy.

Snowy grinned and then immediately dragged it into the Primordial Pagoda!

The old man was stunned for a long time. In the end, he gazed at Wu Ni, but the latter didn’t even spare him a glance.

The old man was furious!

After all, that was utterly shameless! Moreover, they were being so shameless in such an open manner! The Asura Armor and Asura Shield were gone. Now, even their immortal vein was gone. Wasn’t that no different than destroying Asura Hall?

Wu Ni glanced at Yang Ye and An Nanjing, “Let’s go!”

He waved his right hand and vanished on the spot with them.

The old man’s face was covered in bitterness. The Asura Hall could be said to have been completely plundered!

A long time passed before the old man cupped his fist toward the sky, “World Exalt, who is he to make even you dare not act against him?”

A long time passed before a voice came from above, “Wu Ni, one who defied destiny with the Martial Dao.”

The old man’s figure stiffened when he heard this!

Wu Ni!

That was a legendary figure!

A long time passed before the old man shook his head and sighed. He felt that they were very lucky that it came to such an end!

Because while Wu Ni was dead, he wasn’t someone the Asura Hall could offend!

As for the Sprite Progenitor, the old man had given up those thoughts. The Sprite Progenitor was great, but it wasn’t something he could covet!

But he knew the other experts hiding in the shadows desired it.

After all, Wu Ni was still dead!

…

The Southern Desolate Lands.

At the top of the cliff and within the Primordial Pagoda.

On the Ascension Platform.

An Nanjing sat cross-legged there while Yang Ye, Sword Scroll, Erya, and Snowy were in front of her.

Erya licked her tanghulu while frequently sizing up An Nanjing.

Snowy blinked as she gazed at An Nanjing, and then gazed at Erya and waved her paws lightly.

Snowy was telling her that this big sister should not be offended, and that she was very strong!

Very strong!

Snowy was very respectful to An Nanjing. Because she never gave Snowy any face. No, it should be said that An Nanjing was the type of decisive and direct person!

And Snowy had her butt smacked by An Nanjing on many occasions!

Erya nodded, and then she gazed at An Nanjing with a gaze filled with curiosity.

A long time passed before An Nanjing suddenly opened her eyes, and then Snowy hurriedly flew over to her and waved her little paw. Two black spears immediately appeared before An Nanjing!

They were the spears that Yang Ye had obtained in the Primal Battlefield!

An Nanjing glanced at Snowy, touched the spears, and said, “Not bad!”

Snowy cracked a smile, and then she raised the spears in An Nanjing’s direction. She was saying that the spears were for An Nanjing!

An Nanjing rubbed Snowy’s head while a gentle expression appeared in her eyes. She really loved the little fellow, but she wasn’t good at displaying it.

Snowy cracked a smile and rubbed her head lightly against An Nanjing’s hand.

Meanwhile, An Nanjing stood up and looked Yang Ye in the eyes, “Let’s fight!”

Yang Ye was slightly stunned, and then he nodded, “Alright!”

Fight!
