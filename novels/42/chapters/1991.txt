Chapter 1992 – Suppressed!

Outside the Asura Grounds.

Zhi’er spoke softly, “He may not be able to handle it!”

The old man fell silent for a moment and replied, “He can choose to give up!”

She gazed at the old man.

The old man spoke softly, “Master, which supreme expert has not gone through hell? Comfort and ordinary life is for the weak. Why are the strong, strong? How can they become strong without experiencing difficulties and hell?”

She remained silent.

The old man added, “Do you know the greatest difference between him and a Sword Saint?”

Zhi’er gazed at the old man, and the latter explained, “A Sword Saint is still a Sword Saint even without the sword. Not to mention losing the sword, even if they lose their arms, they’re still extraordinary Sword Saints!”

He gazed at the Asura Grounds and continued, “So long as sword cultivators have the sword in their hearts, they themselves will be a sword.”

Zhi’er looked up at the Asura Grounds and fell silent.

In the Asura Grounds.

Yang Ye’s arms had vanished, and he had no choice but to keep dodging.

This time, he truly sensed death. Especially the claw mark on his throat. If he hadn’t reacted fast enough, it would have torn out his throat!

These things that were attacking him were far stronger than ordinary See Dao Realm experts!

Now that he had no hands, the situation was very worrying.

He felt powerless!

Yang Ye hadn’t felt like this for an absolutely long time. In the past, he had his sword in his hands. Even if he was no match for his enemies, he never felt so powerful, and he would fight until the bitter end. Yet now, he’d lost his hands, and it made Yang Ye feel extremely powerless!

This sort of feeling wasn’t just related to his strength, and it was something he felt inside as well.

He was showing signs of accepting his fate!

Yang Ye suddenly woke up from it when he sensed that thought!

Yang Ye was shocked to realize that he actually had thought about accepting his fate!

Accepting his fate was equivalent to giving up. Yang Ye had never imagined that he would actually have such a thought in a hopeless situation. While it was just a thought, it allowed him to realize that his mental state had a huge flaw!

The strong never gave up!

More and more injuries appeared on him. Even with the speed at which the Primordial Pagoda healed him, he wasn’t able to heal himself. If this continued, he would die within the hour!

What should I do? Yang Ye tried his best to calm down.

Energy swords!

Yang Ye issued a command in his heart. In an instant, 10 energy swords appeared around him, and then they formed a huge sword formation that surrounded him. Now that he had the sword formation to protect him, the number of injuries he suffered had declined tremendously!

Counterattack!

Yang Ye knew that if he just defended himself like this, then he would have no chance of surviving this. He had to seize the initiative!

Outside the Asura Grounds.

The old man suddenly said, “His mental strength isn’t bad!”

Zhi’er said, “He won’t be able to hold on for much longer!”

The old man spoke indifferently, “There are some things that he must experience for himself and comprehend. Only then will they be effective. If he doesn’t experience it and comprehend it himself, and I tell him instead, then it would be useless. That’s how the path of cultivation works. At most times, you either become a god or a dead spirit!”

Zhi’er asked, “Do you think he can succeed?”

The old man gazed at the Asura Grounds and replied softly, “Who knows!”

In the Asura Grounds.

The energy swords around Yang Ye were growing fewer and fewer, and Yang Ye was seated cross-legged on the ground. The energy swords around him gradually vanished, and it didn’t take long for a claw to descend upon his head.

If it struck him, then it was obvious that Yang Ye’s head would be clawed open!

Suddenly, Yang Ye opened his eyes.

Swish! Swish! Swish!

The sound of air being torn apart resounded, and something in the surroundings was being torn apart too.

If someone was here, that person would notice that a ray of light was moving nimbly like a venomous snake, and it was ceaselessly flashing through the darkness.

Outside the Asura Grounds.

Zhi’er said, “He did it!”

The old man nodded, “But it’s only the beginning!”

In the Asura Grounds. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

If someone was here, that person would notice that there was a sword on Yang Ye. An ethereal sword had overlapped with Yang Ye. Sword and man had overlapped!

In the pitch black Asura Grounds, a ray of light was flashing incessantly. Just like that, it flashed for around an hour before it stopped.

It dispersed, and Yang Ye descended to the ground. At the same time, the ethereal sword could still be seen within him!

Yang Ye sat weakly on the ground while his countenance was extremely pale.

He was exhausted!

Absolutely exhausted!

Not just exhausted physically, but mentally too. At the moment he was about to die, he suddenly had a thought in his mind.

Was a sword cultivator not a sword cultivator without a sword?

The answer was naturally a no!

So long as a sword cultivator had the sword in their hearts, having a sword in hand wasn’t important at all. Once he thought of that, he was instantly enlightened. Coupled with the thousands of sword techniques he’d studied in the past, he’d gained a flash of inspiration, and he made himself a sword!

He was the sword!

Since there was no sword in his hand, he became the sword!

Once he treated himself as a sword, Yang Ye noticed a brand new world, a brand new world in the Sword Dao!

He was a sword! That was a new discovery for him! It was a new gain! Yang Ye himself wasn’t able to explain this new discovery of his because he hadn’t comprehended it fully!

Actually, it wasn’t difficult for him to accomplish this. Because his attainments in the Sword Dao weren’t weak at all. Conversely, it was very great. Especially after he studied the Six Slaughters of the Weapon Dao and those 10,000 sword techniques, his attainments in the Sword Dao had reached a new height.

He hadn’t accomplished this in the past because he’d never thought in this direction. But after he lost his arms and couldn’t hold a sword, this thought finally appeared in his mind. Was a sword cultivator without a sword not a sword cultivator anymore?

A truly powerful sword cultivator could use anything as a sword, and if there was nothing to use, they could use themselves!

Besides that, Yang Ye had gained one other thing, and it was that he felt like something was changing within him. He felt like he was about to advance!

Sure enough, a true life and death battle was the best for stimulating a person’s potential!

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts and issued a command in his heart. Four swords instantly appeared around him, and they circled him. While there was no movement around him for now, Yang Ye didn’t dare let his guard down. Everything he experienced earlier told him that the slightest carelessness may cause his death in this place!

Around two hours later, Yang Ye’s arms regrew with the help of the Primordial Pagoda, and his injuries were almost fully healed.

Suddenly, the old man, Uncle Guan, appeared in front of him.

Yang Ye opened his eyes and gazed at the old man. The latter nodded slightly, “Looks like you’ve gained quite a bit!”

Yang Ye replied, “Thank you!”

The old man shook his head slightly, “It’s your own hard work. Do you know… countless youths of my god race have come to this place, and all of them are top-rate geniuses in the outside world. However, at least 90% of them perished here. Do you know why?”

Yang Ye shook his head.

The old man smiled, “Actually, many people and even the you from a while before this… All of you geniuses have a problem, and it’s that you’re too confident. You think that there’s no problem in your mental state, and you think that you’re very strong. Actually, if I’m to be honest, all of you think too much of yourselves!”

Yang Ye didn’t know what to say.

Uncle Guan continued, “Who dares to say their mental state is perfect? If such a person exists, it’s because that person hasn’t encountered anything that’s capable of revealing the flaws in his or her mental state. Just what happened to you just now. Death isn’t terrifying, but the torture while waiting for death to arrive is truly terrifying. Fortunately, you overcame it. Congratulations!”

Yang Ye smiled, “Thank you for your guidance!”

Uncle Guan nodded slightly, and then he withdrew a white jade bottle. He opened it, and a blood red pearl floated out from it.

Yang Ye was puzzled, “What’s that?”

Uncle Guan spoke softly, “God blood!”

“God blood?” There was bewilderment in Yang Ye’s eyes.

Uncle Guan nodded slightly, “Lord Shi Tian’s blood!”

He flicked forward, and it entered Yang Ye’s forehead. In an instant, Yang Ye’s body started trembling violently.

Meanwhile, Uncle Guan walked over to Yang Ye, “It contains extremely pure energy. If you’re able to fully absorb it, then not only your cultivation, even your body will be improved tremendously!”

He paused for a moment and continued, “The reason I made you fall into such a hopeless situation wasn’t just so that I could force out your potential, there was another reason. It was because I hoped to make you fall into an absolutely exhausted state, just like the state you’re currently in!”

Yang Ye’s body was trembling more and more violently. It didn’t take long for his clothes to explode apart. If one looked carefully, one would notice that his skin was actually gradually vanishing!

Uncle Guan added, “God blood will change your skin, meridians, bones, and blood. Of course, you’ll still be the same person!”

Just like that, Yang Ye’s skin vanished and grew once more. But this time, his skin had turned quite delicate and white. After that, Yang Ye noticed that the meridians and bones within him were starting to transform.

Time trickled by, and his bones and meridians had been transformed. Now, it was time for his blood!

However, something unexpected occurred!

As soon as that droplet of blood entered Yang Ye’s blood with the intention of changing it, the tiny vortex within Yang Ye suddenly spun. In an instant, everything stopped.

Uncle Guan’s eyes opened wide, “The god blood is being suppressed! How can this be possible…?”
