Chapter 1167 – Waiting For Yang Ye To Become A Saint!

Within the pillar of light was a pair of fiery red gloves. The gloves were completely made out of fiery red dragon scales, and they flickered with a fiery glow. Yang Ye’s gaze descended onto the words below the pillar — Fire Dragon Gauntlets, Quasi Emperor Rank. Made of the scales from an Emperor Rank fire dragon and combined with mysterious crystalline metal. If the soul of a dragon is sealed with it, then it may attain the Emperor Rank!

Seal the soul of a dragon within it? Yang Ye pondered deeply for a moment, and then he flicked his finger. The white pillar of light was instantly blasted apart, and the gauntlets instantly entered into his grasp with a wave of his hand. As soon as the gauntlets touched his palm, flames instantly erupted from them and enveloped Yang Ye. After that, Yang Ye watched with astonishment as his arms were actually instantly covered by fiery red dragon scales.

Moreover, claws had suddenly sprouted out from the tip of his fingers. The claws were thinner than a finger, but they were around 50 centimeters long. They were even much longer than an ordinary short sword!

“Awesome!” There was a trace of excitement in Yang Ye’s eyes as he waved his hands. In an instant, an ear piercing sound of air being torn apart resounded. Even though the space around him hadn’t been sliced apart, there were obvious marks on it!

Yang Ye issued a command in his heart, and the claws instantly retracted back into the gauntlets. After that, the gauntlets transformed into a pair of gauntlets that were covered in tiny spikes. Yang Ye moved his fingers and didn’t find it uncomfortable at all. Because the gauntlets had fused into one with his hands!

Yang Ye pondered deeply for an instant, and then he suddenly swung his right fist.

Hiss!

Everywhere his fist passed, cracks had instantly appeared through space. Even though the cracks were very fine, there were cracks there! But those cracks were repaired at almost the exact same moment that they appeared.

Yang Ye was quite surprised. He was surprised by its strength, and he was even more surprised by the speed that the space here repaired itself. After all, this world had no Heaven Dao, and it had no Laws of the Heaven Dao. So, what was repairing the space here?

Yang Ye didn’t linger on this question. His gaze descended onto the gauntlets he wore, and a smile couldn’t help but curl up on his face. The Fire Dragon Gauntlets falling into his possession was like wings falling into the possession of a tiger, and it was especially so for his physical strength. Moreover, his arms were protected by dragon scales. So if he were to execute the Brink Laws in the future, then the backlash he suffered on his arms and fists would definitely be reduced significantly!

It was a great gain for Yang Ye!

Yang Ye smiled and rubbed Snowy’s head. After that, he left the hall and headed to the next hall. It didn’t take long for Yang Ye to arrive within the 2nd hall. It was called the Technique Hall. But Yang Ye was disappointed because it was completely empty. The 3rd and 4th halls were the same.

It wasn’t that someone had beat him to it; it was because some sort of force had destroyed the pillars of light and contents within the halls.

In next to no time, Yang Ye arrived at the last hall. These halls were actually not small, but they were quite small when compared to the main hall that housed them.

Yang Ye was stunned as soon as he stepped foot into the hall. Because there were 3 Imperial Cloud Shuttles before him!

Imperial Cloud Shuttles!

Moreover, they weren’t ordinary Imperial Cloud Shuttles. Yang Ye noticed that they actually had a pair of huge wings that sprouted out from their sides. Besides that, there were circles of symbols around the cloud shuttles, and they seemed like cannons. He’d seen such circles of symbols in the past because the Imperial Cloud Shuttle which Bai Xiangyao lent him had the same formations. However, Bai Xiangyao’s Imperial Cloud Shuttle only had 1 such formation, and these Imperial Cloud Shuttles had 4 each!

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly. In the beginning, he felt that this destroyed power might not be a Diamond Rank power. But now it would seem like it was very likely to be a Diamond Rank power. Moreover, it was no ordinary Diamond Rank power. Of course, that was based on the standards of the Radiant Dimension.

This world had once been a medium world, so the civilization here and the inheritances here far surpassed the Radiant Dimension. In mother words, based on the past standards of Dark Hell Continent, this destroyed power might be only considered as ordinary. Of course, if it was based on the current standards of Dark Hell Continent, then it was definitely extraordinary!

However, all of that wasn’t important. What was important was that he’d gained huge gains!

Yang Ye waved his right hand and placed the cloud shuttles within the ancient sheath.

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings, left the hall, and then gazed at Snowy who was on his shoulder right now. She naturally understood what he meant, and she pointed ahead.

Yang Ye rubbed her head lightly. If it wasn’t for Snowy, it would have been almost impossible for him to find this place. Because it was quite remote, and he’d gone around numerous hills to find this place.

Suddenly, Yang Ye frowned slightly. He turned around and looked towards the distance, “Someone is actually here! Looks like I have to hurry up.”

Yang Ye vanished on the spot once he finished speaking.

Not long after Yang Ye left, a group arrived where Yang Ye had been standing, and it was none other than the Wolf Soul Mercs.

A middle aged man by Yuan Feng’s side spoke solemnly, “Boss, there were profound energy fluctuations from the Divine Weapon Hall. Obviously, someone has been here and found something! It’s all that bastard, Lin Si’s, fault! He actually didn’t notify us upon discovering this palace. He really deserved to be killed!”

Yuan Feng spoke with a gloomy expression on his face, “That fellow has probably not gone far! Chase him down!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yuan Feng and the others vanished on the spot.

...

Yang Ye travelled according to Snowy’s guidance, and it didn’t take long for him to arrive before a wide river. The river was over 3km wide. Its surface was calm, and it seemed like it was stagnant.

Snowy pointed downwards, and she seemed to be telling Yang Ye to go down.

Yang Ye pondered deeply for a moment, and then his divine sense shot down the river. Some time passed before Yang Ye frowned. Because his divine sense had been obstructed by some sort of energy after it dived just around 500m below the surface.

Snowy pointed down again.

Yang Ye didn’t hesitate to leap into the river.

At this moment, his injuries were almost healed. So even if there was an Emperor down there, he could still fight! In next to no time, Yang Ye had gone almost 10,000km down before finally stopping.

Yang Ye was stunned when he saw the scene at the bottom.

There was a huge formation at the bottom, and a small white dragon was at the center of the formation. At this moment, it was lying flat on the ground with its eyes closed. It was sleeping.

A spirit vein! Yang Ye’s eyes instantly lit up when he saw the small white dragon. Snowy had the same reaction as well. Moreover, she was about to open her mouth and absorb it, but Yang Ye stopped her.

Spirit veins were divided into the low-grade, mid-grade, high-grade, Saint Grade, and Divine Grade. The Divine Grade was the best amongst them. Even though the spirit vein before him could only be considered as a Saint Grade spirit vein, its value was comparable to a Divine Grade spirit vein at Dark Hell Continent where spirit energy had already dried up.

Even though he would gain a huge number of violet crystals by allowing Snowy to absorb it, it was equivalent to killing a chicken for its eggs. He had other plans for the spirit vein!

Yang Ye walked over to the white dragon and placed his right hand on the symbols of the formation. The symbols had just started to emanate dazzling light when they were obliterated by the Decay Laws contained within Yang Ye’s palm. Once the symbols were eliminated, a strand of terrifying spirit energy swept out from within the formation. Fortunately, it was suppressed by Yang Ye’s sword intent and slaughter intent.

Meanwhile, the white dragon woke up.

But Yang Ye’s Void Rank sword intent and slaughter intent had immediately suppressed it.

The white dragon gazed at Yang Ye while pleading with its eyes.

It had been imprisoned here for tens of thousands of years. While spirit veins could grow, the precondition was having spirit energy to absorb. Even though they could increase the spirit energy in an area, their lives would still come to an end if they had no spirit energy to absorb. The reason this white dragon was still alive was because it had been sealed within the formation. The spirit energy it emanated couldn’t escape the formation, so it could be considered to have been feeding and maintaining itself!

Snowy pointed at the white dragon, and then she touched Yang Ye’s face lightly. She seemed to be pleading on behalf of the white dragon. Because seeing the white dragon made her remember her past. At that time, she’d been imprisoned by Welkin Wolf Demon King for years as well.

Yang Ye said, “I can let you live. But you have to obey me, alright?”

The white dragon nodded swiftly!

Yang Ye asked, “Can you become smaller?”

The white dragon nodded again, and then transformed into a smaller white dragon that was around Snowy’s size. However, it seemed to be absolutely afraid of Snowy and didn’t dare get close to her at all. Even though both of them were beings of nature, Snowy specialized in growing through the consumption of spirit energy while it was a spirit vein. So, it could be said to be one of the beings with the purest spirit energy throughout the world.

Yang Ye smiled and said, “Don’t be afraid. She won’t eat you.”

Snowy glanced at Yang Ye, glanced at the small white dragon, and then opened her mouth. The small white dragon’s expression instantly changed drastically, and it quickly ran into Yang Ye’s arms while shivering. Meanwhile, Snowy closed her mouth and revealed a huge smile.

The corners of Yang Ye’s mouth twitched. He rubbed Snowy’s head and said, “It’s very obedient, so stop scaring it. You can absorb those disobedient fellows in the future, alright?”

Snowy nodded, and then she rubbed her head against Yang Ye’s face. It seemed like she was saying that he could make the decisions.

Yang Ye placed the small white dragon within the pocket of space that Zi’er had created, and then he said, “Absorb the spirit energy around here!”

Snowy pointed at Yang Ye, and then she pointed at Yang Ye’s mouth.

Yang Ye asked, “You want me to absorb it?”

Snowy nodded. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Yang Ye pondered deeply for a moment and nodded. Even though his injuries were almost healed, they weren’t healed completely. Moreover, all the Primordial Violet Energy within him had been used to repair his body, so he had practically no violet energy left within him. While his body was strong, he still had to use his sword when dealing with true experts. But swords naturally required profound energy.

Yang Ye sat cross-legged on the spot. The spirit energy around him was extremely dense and had practically taken material form. If Snowy was allowed to absorb it, she would be able to produce a few thousand violet crystals at least.

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts and started urging the tiny vortex to start absorbing the spirit energy here. As soon as it started revolving, Yang Ye’s body seemed like a vortex that sucked in all the spirit energy around him. After that, threads of Primordial Violet Energy appeared within Yang Ye, and then Yang Ye’s aura grew stronger and stronger. Even the water around him had started to bubble violently.

15 minutes later, Yang Ye’s aura had grown even stronger.

The water within the entire river had started to evaporate, and it was evaporating at a visible speed!

An hour later, the water throughout the river was gone.

Meanwhile, the members of the Wolf Soul Mercs had arrived not too far away from Yang Ye. They’d been drawn over here by the drastic changes in the river!

Yuan Feng and the others were stunned when they arrived here and saw Yang Ye.

They hadn’t expected that they would actually encounter him here!

As soon as they recovered from their shock, one of the members of the Souleater Mercs intended to charge forward and kill Yang Ye. But Yuan Feng stopped him.

A smile had curled up on the corners of Yuan Feng’s mouth, “See that? He’s charging into the Saint Realm!”

That mercenary’s eyes lit up, “Boss, you mean that we should let him advance to the Saint Realm and kill him for energy stones?”

“That kid’s natural talent is superb, so attaining the Saint Realm is practically not a problem for him. If we kill him once he attains the Saint Realm, we’ll be able to obtain 5 violet crystals at the very least!” Yuan Feng spoke indifferently, “But if we kill him now, we’ll get absolutely nothing! So, let’s wait for him to attain the Saint Realm!”

The other members of the Wolf Soul Mercs immediately nodded and displayed their agreement.
