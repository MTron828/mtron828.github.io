Chapter 850 – Trampling!

The sword entered the sheath before Yang Ye drew swiftly once more!

Hiss! CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Besides Kong Lian who was at the Monarch Realm, all the other white robed disciples of the Dao Order were slashed into two.

At this moment, the minds of everyone here had gone blank, including Kong Lian, and Kong Lian’s eyes were filled with disbelief!

At this moment, the disciples of the Ancient Sword School were beyond shocked. They as well had never imagined that Yang Ye was actually so terrifying.

My god! All of them were white robed disciples of the Dao Order! But he killed them like he was chopping through vegetables!

As for the spectators, most didn’t even dare believe their eyes.

The surroundings had gone silent, absolutely silent!

“I admit that we underestimated you. We severely underestimated you!” Meanwhile, a low voice sounded out from the sky, and the voice carried a trace of killing intent yet was mostly filled with shock.

Yang Ye laughed with ridicule before he looked down at Man Ba. At this moment, Man Ba was staring at him with eyes that were filled with ferocity. It wasn’t that Man Ba didn’t want to move, but it was that he couldn’t move at all. Yang Ye’s foot was on his stomach, and it was like a mountain pressing down upon him, causing him to be on the verge of suffocation!

“I’m a very narrow-minded person, and I can’t stand anything I dislike being in front of me.” Yang Ye looked down at Man Ba and said, “What you said earlier truly displeased me. So, I’ve decided to make even death a dream for you!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye raised his sword and stabbed it into Man Ba’s mouth before shaking it lightly. Man Ba’s tongue was instantly chopped into bits. At the same time, his foot pressed down, and a muffled explosion resounded from Man Ba’s stomach.

He’d naturally chopped off Man Ba’s tongue and destroyed his Dantian so that Man Ba couldn’t take his own life!

“How dare you!” A furious howl resounded in the sky, and then a huge palm tore through space and immediately appeared above Yang Ye.

It was about to claw Yang Ye into pieces when a ray of sword energy suddenly shot out from the sky. It was extremely swift and instantly struck the enormous palm, causing it to tremble violently before quickly shrinking back!

“Nangong Tian!” A low voice that carried violent killing intent resounded through the sky.

“Qing Wuji, aren’t you ashamed of yourself for interfering in the business of the younger generation!?” As soon as this voice finished resounding through the air, an old man who wore a robe which was a mix of green and white appeared in the sky above everyone. At the same time, an old man appeared in front of him. The old man wore a grey robe, and his entire body was enveloped beneath his robe, causing it to be impossible to discern his appearance.

The grey robed man spoke in a deep voice, “Nangong Tian, looks like your Ancient Sword School intends to act against my Dao Order?”

“Not at all!” Nangong Tian spoke indifferently, “Isn’t it normal for the juniors to fight each other? That fellow, Man Ba, from your Dao Order killed numerous disciples of my Ancient Sword School in the past, but my Ancient Sword School didn’t say a word, right? If they are killed in a battle with someone in the same realm of cultivation, then it was because they lacked skill and ability. If a disciple of my Ancient Sword School died at his hands, then it was because they didn’t train well enough. Yet now, when a disciple of your Dao Order lost to a disciple of my Ancient Sword School, a senior like you actually intends to interfere. Needless to say, it’s truly a humiliation!”

When he spoke up to this point, Nangong Tian pointed at Yang Ye and said, “All I’ll say is that so long as a disciple of your Dao Order who’s in the same realm of cultivation as him is able to kill him, then you can do as you please with him. My Ancient Sword School won’t say a word about it! However, if your Dao Order intends to act shamelessly and intends to bully the young, then while my Ancient Sword School might not be able to keep him alive, we guarantee that we’ll kill every single genius your Dao Order obtains in the future!”

The Ancient Sword School couldn’t be said to have a close relationship with Yang Ye, but Yang Ye absolutely couldn’t be allowed to be bullied and killed by someone at a higher realm of cultivation. Otherwise, it wouldn’t just disappoint the countless disciples of the Ancient Sword School, it would be equivalent to causing the Ancient Sword School to lose an extraordinary genius in the Sword Dao and become the laughingstock of the entire prefecture!

It could be said that Yang Ye’s fate was related to the Dao Order’s honor, but it was also related to the Ancient Sword School’s honor!

The grey robed old man fell silent. Meanwhile, Yang Ye had started moving instead. He dragged along Man Ba who was on the verge of death while he walked forward, step by step.

Suddenly, he stopped and gazed at Wu Yanzhong, “Senior Brother, please bring along the corpses of those other disciples of the Dao Order!”

Wu Yanzhong glanced at Yang Ye before he nodded.

Just like that, Wu Yanzhong and the others each dragged a corpse along as they followed Yang Ye.

“How dare you!” The grey robed man was furious when he witnessed this scene. However, a ray of sword energy tore through the sky and appeared in front of him.

“Brother Qing, we haven’t sparred for a long time. Since we were able to meet each other today, then why don’t we spar right now!?” As soon as Nangong Tian finished speaking, sword energy instantly covered the sky.

The two extraordinary experts were fighting in the sky, but Yang Ye didn’t stop at all. He just dragged Man Ba along as he walked step by step. Man Ba gazed resentfully at Yang Ye and wanted to move, but he couldn’t move anymore. Because Yang Ye had crippled his limbs and the meridians within them, so he couldn’t take his own life even if he wanted to.

All along the way, countless people followed behind Yang Ye as they were curious of Yang Ye’s intentions.

The crowd gradually realized where Yang Ye was headed. Because it was in the direction of the city gates!

Suddenly, Kong Lian stood before Yang Ye and the others.

Kong Lian didn’t speak a single word, but the black sickle in her hand started spinning madly while strands of terrifying aura surged out from within her. Even space started to ripple before the aura she emanated.

Kong Lian raised her sickle slowly and pointed it at Yang Ye, “You’re very strong. I noticed that you hadn’t utilized your full strength just now. I’m truly really curious about how strong an Exalt Realm profounder like you are!”

Meanwhile, Wu Yanzhong arrived in front of Yang Ye while an iron sword appeared in his grasp, “Kong Lian, bullying someone in a lower realm of cultivation is a disgrace. Didn’t you want to experience my slow sword? I’ll allow you to experience it right now!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Wu Yanzhong didn’t wait for her refusal and just stabbed his sword forward in a very simple manner.

It was a very ordinary attack, extremely ordinary. It was just like something common that had nothing special about it. However, it was exactly such an attack that caused Kong Lian’s expression to change!

“Your sword technique isn’t bad!” Yang Ye nodded, and then he continued forward while dragging Man Ba along. He took a few steps before he suddenly stopped, and then he gazed at Kong Lian who was in fierce battle with Wu Yanzhong, “I’ll allow you to witness it if you survive!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye continued walking towards the city gates.

The disciples of the Ancient Sword School who were following behind him quickly took the corpse that Wu Yanzhong had been dragging along before following Yang Ye.

“How dare you! You actually dare to humiliate my Dao Order!?” Suddenly, a white robed man flashed over from afar. However, he hadn’t even gotten close when a strand of sword energy slashed him into two!

“Yang Ye!” Fan Meng was shocked, and she hurriedly ran over to Yang Ye. Because blood was actually seeping out of the corner of Yang Ye’s mouth.

Yang Ye shook his head and said, “There’s no need to worry, it’s just a small issue. Right, remember to take the spatial rings off those corpses. All of those are treasures!”

“Are... are you really fine?” Fan Meng was on the verge of crying because he didn’t seem like he was fine no matter how she looked at it.

“Don’t worry, I know my limits!” Yang Ye smiled, and then he turned his head to gaze at a disciple of the Ancient Sword School behind him, “Brother, isn’t dragging them like this a little too troublesome? How about we get a rope and string their corpses together. Wouldn’t that be easier?”

“I’m Lin Xiao!” The man continued, “Are you sure you want to do that?”

Yang Ye nodded, “Of course!”

He took a deep and long glance at Yang Ye before he nodded.

It didn’t take long for all the other disciples of the Dao Order besides Man Ba to be tied together like a meat skewer.

Countless people in the surroundings were astounded by such a scene.

He intends to completely humiliate the Dao Order!Obviously, it was impossible for any reconciliation to be achieved between Yang Ye and the Dao Order.

Just like that, Yang Ye dragged Man Ba along as he walked towards the city gates while Lin Xiao stood behind him with a rope in his hand. The corpses of 5 white robed disciples of the Dao Order were tied together on that rope.

Yang Ye seemed to be in a comparatively better state because he was still as calm and composed as he was before this. However, tempestuous waves of emotions were surging through the hearts of Lin Xiao and the others.

The Ancient Sword School and Dao Order had fought countless times, and the disciples of both sides had killed and insulted the other. However, it was the first time that the Dao Order had been humiliated like this.

At this moment, the worry in their hearts was far greater than the happiness and excitement they felt. Because the slightest mistake might cause war to erupt between the Ancient Sword School and the Dao Order!

If two Platinum Rank sects were to start fighting, then it would affect the entire prefecture!

“Ancient Sword School! You’re courting death!” Suddenly, another voice resounded from the distant crowd, and then a figure shot towards Yang Ye’s group.

“Sword!” Yang Ye waved his hand, and then a sword suddenly flew out from the crowd and transformed into a ray of light that entered Yang Ye’s grasp. He sheathed it and drew it swiftly.

The sword shattered, a ray of light flashed, and then death descended.

Just like that, there was another corpse tied on the string.

Disciples of the Dao Order shot out incessantly from within the crowd. There were those who wore white robes, black robes, and even red robes. However, all of them were tied to the rope without exception.

Now, there were at least over 40 corpses tied to it!

All of them belonged to the Dao Order!

...

It didn’t take long for Yang Ye’s group to reach the city gates.

Yang Ye placed Man Ba on the ground before he turned around to gaze at Lin Xiao, “Brother Lin, help me get over a dozen Beasts of Desire!”

Lin Xiao’s expression changed slightly. He glanced at Man Ba, and then he pondered deeply before he said, “It only takes a single swing of the sword. There’s really no need for that!”

Yang Ye shook his head and said, “That would be letting him off too easily. He can insult me because I would just kill him at the very most. But since he insulted my friends, then I’ll make even death something difficult for him to attain. Didn’t he say that he would humiliate my friends? Now, I’m going to make him personally experience how it feels!”

Terror finally appeared in Man Ba’s eyes when he heard this.

Lin Xiao gazed at Yang Ye for a short while, and then he nodded and left.

Yang Ye walked over to the end of the rope, and then he grabbed it before leaping up onto the city wall, and then he tied the rope there. Just like that, a string of corpses was hung on the city walls of Martial Enlightenment City.

Meanwhile, Lin Xiao had returned, and he’d brought over a dozen Beasts of Desire with him.

Yang Ye pointed at Man Ba. The beasts instantly howled before charging over to Man Ba.

Yang Ye raised his head and looked up into the sky, “Didn’t your Dao Order want to play? Then let’s play!”

“Alright, we’ll play with you!” A voice resounded from the sky.

It was the voice of a Saint!
