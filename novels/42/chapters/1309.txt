Chapter 1310 – I’m Deciding If I Should Kill You!

Yang Ye’s hairs were standing on end.

Someone had actually arrived behind him without making a single sound, and he hadn’t noticed at all. It wasn’t just him, even the violet mink who was controlling the space around them hadn’t noticed.

Who is that?

Yang Ye was slightly stunned when he heard the voice. Because it was clear, melodious, and sounded slightly young. Yang Ye and the violet mink exchanged glances before turning around.

It was a young woman who was standing around 10m before them. She seemed to be around the age of 15 or 16, and she wore a dress made from unknown violet scales. Her face was oval, her eyes curved up slightly at the corner, her skin was crystalline and white as snow, and her features were fine and exquisite. While she seemed to be a little young, she carried a noble and graceful aura that had a faint dignified air.

There was a small multicolored snake on her tight arm, and it laid there quietly as if it had fallen asleep.

Yang Ye and the violent mink exchanged glances again, and then they simultaneously became vigilant.

The young woman gazed at the violet mink first, and there was curiosity in her eyes. Next, she gazed at Snowy who was sleeping on Yang Ye’s shoulder. After that she sized up Yang Ye, and there was curiosity in her eyes as well. But in the end, her gaze descended onto Snowy again. There was bewilderment and a trace of disbelief in her eyes.

Yang Ye sized her up and asked, “Are you human or demon?”

Yang Ye didn’t attack because she had been able to arrive behind them without making a single sound, and she’d seen through Snowy and Zi’er in an instant. So, she was absolutely not an ordinary person. Or perhaps, it should be said that she was no ordinary demon. If the violet mink and he couldn’t kill her with a single strike.... Just thinking about countless demon beasts swarming him made a chill run down Yang Ye’s spin.

She gazed at Yang Ye when she heard him. But she didn’t speak and just gazed at him. However, Yang Ye’s expression changed because he actually sensed a strand of invisible pressure. It wasn’t something she’d released intentionally, and it was something she carried naturally!

Who is she? Yang Ye grew even more curious.

Meanwhile, the young woman didn’t answer Yang Ye, and she turned around to look at the violet mink instead, “It’s impossible for a Spatial Mink to appear in this world. But based on your strength, it’s impossible for you to have come from outside this world.”

As she spoke, she suddenly pointed at Snowy and continued, “It too. How could it possibly appear in this world?”

Once she finished speaking, she gazed at Yang Ye and added, “A human at the Quasi Emperor Realm, yet you possess the Sword Domain and have attained the Rebirth Rank in sword intent....”

Yang Ye’s pupils constricted, and he interrupted her, “You know of the Rebirth Rank!”

The Rebirth Rank!

After all, Jian Wuji had said that only those who’d attained that rank would be aware of it.

Has she attained the Rebirth Rank with a type of intent? Yang Ye’s face grew even more solemn when he thought up to this point.

The young woman gazed coldly at Yang Ye, “Interrupting others is very rude. Understand?” Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Yang Ye was speechless.

She gazed at him and added, “Besides you, both of them shouldn’t be here, and it’s impossible for them to have been born here. But they just so happen to be here. I’m truly bewildered!”

Yang Ye remained silent. She seems to have guessed that they are from outside this world. Who exactly is she?

Meanwhile, the young woman spoke abruptly, “Home, don’t you think that you should give me an explanation?”

Yang Ye’s face twisted. That tone... it sounds like a superior talking to her subordinate. But she does it so naturally as if I should give her an explanation!

Yes! That was exactly how Yang Ye felt right now!

Yang Ye glanced at her, and she was looking at him as if she was waiting for his answer. Yang Ye hesitated for a moment before he said, “We were sent here.”

He didn’t make up a lie to deceive her. Because he had a feeling that she wouldn’t buy it. Moreover, it didn’t hurt to tell the truth right now.

“As I expected!” She seemed as if she’d guessed the answer. She glanced at Yang Ye and asked, “Why?”

Yang Ye replied, “Because I offended someone. So, I was sent here to avoid death.”

She looked up at the sky and said, “The person that sent you here is very strong.”

“Indeed!” Yang Ye nodded, and then he said, “I’ve answered your questions. Now it’s my turn to ask you questions, right?”

She withdrew her gaze and looked at Yang Ye again, “Ask. But I might not answer.”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

He gazed at her for a short while before he gulped and asked, “Who are you?”

“I refuse to answer that!” said the young woman, and it sounded like it was a matter of course.

The corners of Yang Ye’s mouth twitched, and then he asked, “Why do you know about Spatial Minks? And what’s a Sprite Lord?”

He was extremely curious about that. Because not to mention the violet mink, she even seemed to know Snowy’s origins. After all, even Lady wasn’t aware of Snowy’s origins. Lady had seen Snowy, and she would have definitely told him if she recognized Snowy.

The young woman gazed at Yang Ye in silence, and she seemed to be thinking about something.

Yang Ye said, “You refuse to answer this question as well?”

“No!” She spoke indifferently, “I’m deciding if I should kill you.”

Yang Ye’s face froze. The violet mink’s face instantly turned cold when she heard the young woman, and faint violet light instantly arose on her palms.

Yang Ye’s left hand moved slightly, and the ancient sheathe appeared in his grasp. He gazed at her and said, “Have you made your decision?”

She replied, “I’m slightly hesitant!”

Yang Ye asked, “Why?”

The young woman glanced at the violet mink and Snowy, “They are quite close to you, so they’ll definitely hate me if I kill you. Or perhaps they’ll die with you. Even though you deserve death, they don’t.”

Yang Ye started laughing from extreme rage, “I deserve death? Tell me why I deserve death?”

The young woman spoke coldly, “The greed of humans is insatiable. They always want things that don’t belong to them. If they can’t obtain it, they’ll seize it, just like the humans on Heaven Pillar Mountain. But it’s very normal because humans wouldn’t be humans if they didn’t have insatiable greed. Fortunately, they’ll pay the price for it.”

“There are bad humans, but are there no bad demons?” Yang Ye refuted, “Regardless of whether it’s the human race of the demon race, there are good and bad individuals amongst them. Right? Moreover, it’s your demon race that wants to attack the human race, so it’s your demon race that’s full of insatiable greed!”

“The demon race is attacking the human race?” The young woman’s eyes narrowed slightly, “Human, do you know that the human race would have been annihilated a long time ago if the demon race wanted to attack?”

Yang Ye frowned, “You’re not attacking?”

A cold smile curled up on the corners of her mouth, “I want to. Unfortunately, those fellows insist on abiding by the agreement set by the human race and demon race’s ancestors. Otherwise, the demon race’s army would have crushed Heaven Pillar Peak a long time ago. But it’s fine because your human race will be breaching that agreement very soon. At that time, hohoho....” A strange yet cold laughter resounded from her at this point, and her voice was filled with ridicule and a wisp of anticipation.

The demon race has no intention to attack the human race! Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly. What did it mean if she was telling the truth? It meant that the Nie Clan had a secret! What exactly was the Nie Clan planning by gathering the experts of the entire human race? He didn’t know what they were planning, but he knew that the Nie Clan wanted to use the 3 sects, 6 cities, the Slayer Pavilion and him.

Yang Ye gazed at her and spoke solemnly, “Does the demon race really have no intention to attack the human race?”

She gazed coldly at him yet remained silent, and she seemed to be figuring out if she really should kill Yang Ye.

Yang Ye felt extremely uncomfortable when being stared at like that. However, he wasn’t in the mood to make a fuss about it. He immediately said, “If the human race and demon race really enter into war, then even if the human race loses, your demon race will have to pay a price. As a member of the demon race, can you really bear to watch as countless demon beasts die miserable?”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye sighed while a bitter smile arose on the corner of his mouth. He’d never imagined that he would actually speak on behalf of the human race one day.... In the end, while he didn’t want to be a savior and didn’t have the ability to be one, he didn’t mind helping the human race if it was within the scope of his ability.

The young woman said, “But what if it’s the human race that’s attacking our demon race?”

Yang Ye was stunned and said, “How could that be possible? The human race isn’t stupid. Why would it attack the demon race?”

The demon race’s strength far surpassed the human race. So, if the human race still intended to attack the demon race, then he had to say that the human race was moronic.

The young woman didn’t speak. She just looked at him as if she had once again started to contemplate if she should kill him.

Yang Ye was truly quite annoyed by the gaze she shot at him, and he immediately spoke angrily, “Do you plan to kill me or not?!”

The young woman paid no attention to him, and she gazed at the violet mink instead, “Want to leave this world?”

Zi’er just gazed at her in silence.

She continued, “You’ll have no future if you stay with him; come with me and I’ll give you everything you want. Moreover, I can bring you out of this world! Away from this world!”

Yang Ye was stunned. Why do these words sound so familiar?
