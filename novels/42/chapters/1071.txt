Chapter 1072 – You’re My Wife!

“2,000 violet crystals?” Shi Tian roared with laughter, and he laughed for quite some time before a fierce expression suddenly arose on his face, “Don’t kill them. I want them to regret being born!”

As soon as he gave the order, the army behind him instantly charged at Yang Ye’s group!

Hiss!

Meanwhile, a ray of black light flashed, and then a spear pierced through the chests of over a dozen guards.

Shi Tian and the others’ expressions changed, and their gazes descended onto the person who launched the attack.

It was Xuwu Shen!

Yang Ye glanced at Xuwu Shen with surprise. The latter shrugged, “Actually, I’m quite strong. You just never gave me the chance to prove it!”

Yang Ye nodded and pointed at Shi Tian and the other 3 Saints, “Don’t say that I didn’t give you a chance. I’ll leave the 4 of them to you!”

Xuwu Shen raised his hands, “Big Brother, I take back what I said!”

“You’re courting death!” Meanwhile, Shi Tian roared furiously and charged at Yang Ye’s group with the other 3 middle aged men. Besides that, the army of around 1,000 high rank Half-Saints followed behind them!

Bang!

A ray of golden light flashed, and then one of the Saints by Shi Tian’s side was blasted flying. A moment later, An Nanjing suddenly appeared in front of that Saint, and she swung her leg right at him. Her kick was beyond swift, and that Saint wasn’t even able to react before it struck his chest.

Bang!

A muffled bang resounded. That Saint crashed down to the ground, and his fate was unknown!

A moment later, An Nanjing appeared in front of another Saint. Just like the Saint before him, they merely exchanged 2 blows before he was blasted flying as well, and he flew over 5,000km away.

After dealing with 2 Saints in an instant, An Nanjing gazed at the black robed middle aged man by Shi Tian’s side. The middle aged man’s pupils constricted, and he was just about to attack when a spear tore through the air like a golden streak. It instantly arrived before him. The black robed man was shocked and hurriedly waved his hands, causing the space around him to become fortified and form a thick spatial wall!

Bang!

The spear slammed against the spatial wall, and it instantly cracked apart before the spear pierced through the black robed middle aged man’s chest!

The black robed middle aged man’s eyes were opened wide and filled with disbelief! In an instant later, the color in his eyes had dimmed, and countless strands of spirit energy surged out from within him.

A Saint had fallen!

In less than 20 breaths of time, 2 Saints had suffered miserable defeat and 1 had been killed!

Everyone here gazed at An Nanjing, and even Shi Tian had done the same. At this moment, Shi Tian’s body was trembling!

An Nanjing waved her right hand and Skysplit flew back into her grasp. After that, she turned around, walked over to Yang Ye’s side, and fell silent.

Yang Ye glanced at her, and there was a trace of shock in his eyes. He knew she was very strong, but he hadn’t expected her to be that strong. Because even he couldn’t have done it any better. Fortunately, An Nanjing was on his side, and she was going with him to White Deer Academy!

Xuwu Shen glanced at An Nanjing, and the corners of his mouth twitched while he unconsciously took a few steps back. Even though he knew that An Nanjing was very strong, he hadn’t expected her to be that strong.

I really should avoid offending her in the future! Xuwu Shen decided in his heart. He hadn’t forgotten how An Nanjing had asked him to fight her in single combat. Now, he felt very lucky that he hadn’t agreed, or he would have been crushed before he even realized it!

The beautiful woman and the others from Cloud Merchant Group had solemn expressions on their faces, and their gazes were on An Nanjing!

The grey robed old man behind the beautiful woman spoke solemnly, “Eldest Young Miss, her strength is probably sufficient to be ranked on the Martial Rankings!”

The Martial Rankings!

Yu Qing’s pupils constricted when he heard the old man. The Martial Rankings was the ranking which was held in the highest regard within the Central Divine Prefecture! Anyone capable of being ranked on there was absolutely a genius amongst geniuses!

The beautiful woman nodded lightly, “She is strong indeed. As for whether she can be ranked on the Martial Rankings, it’s too early to say for sure. At the very least, the strength she has revealed until now isn’t sufficient for that. Of course, I’m most curious about that man called Ye Yang. Because he’s clearly the leader of the group!”

The grey robed old man said, “His speed and strength aren’t bad. He has clearly cultivated his body. Only his true physical strength and ability is still a mystery!”

She replied, “We’ll find out soon!”

...

Yang Ye gazed at Shi Tian and smiled, “Do you know why you’re still alive?”

Shi Tian and the others behind him had very unsightly expressions on their faces. The situation had been turned around in an instant. At this moment, they realized that numbers were nothing.

Shi Tian took a deep breath, “I admit defeat!” As he spoke, his right hand which was beneath his sleeve moved slightly as he crushed a talisman.

Yang Ye said, “I don’t like talking nonsense. Do you have 2,000 violet crystals or not?”

Shi Tian clenched his fists, and quite some time passed before he shook his head, “I don’t!”

Yang Ye nodded. Skysplit suddenly left An Nanjing’s grasp, and it transformed into a ray of golden light which instantly appeared in front of Shi Tian. Shi Tian’s pupils constricted, and he naturally didn’t choose to stand there and wait for death to arrive. He withdrew a huge saber, and he swung it with both hands!

Clang!

The clear and melodious sound of metal colliding resounded, and then his saber exploded into pieces while the powerful force of the collision blasted him flying. He’d just fallen to the ground when a ray of golden light instantly arrived before him. Shi Tian was horrified.

Suddenly, a huge palm tore through space, and it was clenched into a fist before slamming itself against Skysplit.

Bang!

Skysplit was pushed slightly off target, and it passed by Shi Tian’s head and stabbed into the ground.

An Nanjing’s eyes narrowed slightly, she waved her right hand and summoned Skysplit back.

She was about to attack again when Yang Ye stopped her.

Meanwhile, an old man in luxurious robes appeared in front of Shi Tian.

A mid-rank Saint!

The old man paid no attention to Shi Tian, and his gaze just descended onto An Nanjing. A short while passed before he gazed at Yang Ye, “I’m the Deputy City Governor of Sky Capital City, Mo Yun. How about we just forget what happened today?”

Yang Ye pointed at Shi Tian and said, “That’s what he said earlier, but I’m sure you’ve seen the outcome of that.”

“I’ve only noticed my subordinates being killed or injured!” Mo Yun looked Yang Ye in the eyes and said, “Either leave or be thrown out of the city on your backs. What’s your choice?”

Bang!

A pair of black wings appeared behind Yang Ye. His figure shot forward explosively and instantly arrived before Mo Yun, and then he slammed his fist towards Mo Yun.

The others behind Mo Yun were instantly blasted flying by the powerful force contained within the punch.

Mo Yun’s eyes narrowed as he slowly clenched his right fist. A moment later, the space before him suddenly warped, and it caused Yang Ye’s fist to start warping as well. But Yang Ye suddenly twisted his fist a moment later, and the warped space instantly collapsed. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

The fist faced no further obstruction and arrived before Mo Yun. The corners of Mo Yun’s eyes twitched slightly while a trace of seriousness could be seen in his eyes. He didn’t dare act carelessly and circulated his profound energy before pouring it into his right arm, and then he slammed his fist against Yang Ye’s fist.

Bang!

An explosion resounded as the space around them instantly exploded apart. Mo Yun was forced back repeatedly by the powerful force of the collision, and he moved over 30m back. Meanwhile, not only did Yang Ye’s figure show no signs of being pushed back, Yang Ye even pressed forward and slammed his fist at Mo Yun again!

Bang!

Mo Yun was blasted back again, but Yang Ye appeared in front of him again just a moment later!

Just like that, Mo Yun was blasted over 500m back in just a few breaths of time, and he didn’t even have the ability to fight back. Shi Tian and the others were astounded. After all, Mo Yun was the Deputy City Governor and a mid-rank Saint. However, he didn’t even have the ability to fight back when facing that man called Ye Yang!

Who is he?

This question hadn’t just appeared in Shi Tian and the others’ minds, even the others from Cloud Merchant Group had solemn expressions on their faces.

“He’s probably a body cultivator!” The grey robed old man behind the beautiful woman spoke solemnly, “His body has already attained the Divine Valor Realm. I never expected that such a genius would have actually come from Pine Prefecture!”

The beautiful woman’s gaze was on Yang Ye as well, and she remained silent for a short while before she crushed a talisman.

The grey robed old man was slightly puzzled, “Eldest Young Miss?”

She spoke solemnly, “Investigate him again!”

...

Bang!

Yang Ye slammed his fist against Mo Yun’s stomach, and a mouthful of blood sprayed from the latter before he crashed against the ground. Yang Ye was about to charge forward when a voice suddenly resounded, “Stop!”

As soon as the voice resounded, an old man and 10 women in moon white robed appeared here.

The old man glanced at Yang Ye, and then he glanced at one of the women behind him, “Elder Lin Yueyin, please forgive me for this scene. I’ll personally send you to White Deer Mountain Range once I’m done with the matters here!”

The woman called Lin Yueyin glanced at Yang Ye and said, “There’s no need for that, City Governor Chen. We’ll leave right now!”

Suddenly, Yang Ye obstructed Lin Yueyin and the others’ path.

Lin Yueyin frowned slightly while a wisp of detest flashed through her eyes, “Fuck off!”

However, Yang Ye paid no attention to her at all. His gaze was on a woman by Lin Yueyin’s side, and his hand was trembling from excitement and joy, “Yuxi, it’s you....”

It was none other than Xiao Yuxi!

Yang Ye hadn’t expected that he would have actually encountered her here, and his feelings at this moment were simply indescribable.

Xiao Yuxi’s beautiful brows were pressed together as she said, “You know me?”

Yang Ye was stunned, “You’re my wife. How could I not know you!”

As soon as Yang Ye finished speaking, Xiao Yuxi suddenly drew her sword and swung it, and a ray of saber energy instantly struck Yang Ye.

Bang!

Yang Ye was blasted over 20m away! Moreover, a gash that was a few dozen centimeters long had appeared on his chest!

Yang Ye was stunned as he gazed at the injury on his chest!
