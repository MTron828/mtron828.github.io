Chapter 2183 – The Undying Race!

The sword intent it emanated was quite familiar to him!

Everyone watched as a woman in a green dress appeared before them.

Yang Ye frowned when he saw her. Because he didn’t recognize her at all!

After she arrived, her gaze immediately descended onto Yang Ye.

She smiled, “Long time no see!”

Yang Ye asked, “Who are you?”

She smiled, “Do you really not remember me?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “You seem a little familiar, but I’m sure that I’ve never seen you before!”

“Of course!” She smiled, “I was just a child when we met. Now, I’ve grown up!”

A child!

Yang Ye was stunned.

Meanwhile, she flicked a strand of sword intent over to him.

“That’s…” Yang Ye gazed at it with astonishment. Because it was his own sword intent. While it was very weak, it was his.

She walked over to him and said, “Situ Tingyun!”

Yang Ye was stunned for quite some time before he spoke with astonishment, “Y-You’re that little girl!”

Tingyun!

At this moment, Yang Ye recalled that he’d given a young girl in the lower universe three strands of his sword intent because of her natural talent. He’d just done so casually without any objectives. He’d done it all because he felt her natural talent wasn’t bad, and he’d never imagined her to actually be here now!

Actually, Yang Ye didn’t know that his sword intent from all those years was at the peak of the lower universe, and countless sword cultivators dreamed of possessing it. He didn’t know what that small gift of his represented to the young girl!

She smiled, “Surprised?”

She should be called Sword Empress Tingyun. Perhaps no one here had heard of her name, but in the lower universe, it was dazzling like Yang Ye and An Nanjing’s names right now!

Yang Ye sized up the woman before him and nodded, “I’m very surprised. I didn’t expect you to have grown to such an extent!”

She’d comprehended sword intent while she was just a child, and her cultivation hadn’t been low. Now, while she was just a Major Zen Realm expert, her cultivation in the Sword Dao was extremely strong, and even Yang Ye couldn’t really see through it.

Tingyun smiled and glanced at the surroundings, “My strength is limited, so I’ll deal with three Sages. I can’t do anything about the rest.”

Yang Ye shook his head, “You don’t owe me anything!”

“That’s your opinion!” She looked him in the eyes, “I should naturally repay your kindness!”

She transformed into a ray of light that shot towards a few Sages, and powerful sword intent surged out incessantly, causing others to be unable to look straight at her!

They didn’t dare to underestimate their opponent!

Those Sages hurriedly circulated their profound energy and started to resist her attacks.

“Then let’s fight!” Sky Maiden transformed into a beam of white light that shot upward. Blood Maiden and Blind Maiden were by her side, and went straight for over a dozen Sages.

Suddenly, A’Man said, “Brothers, if we die today, remember to be brothers again in our next life!”

As soon as she finished speaking, he charged at Sage with her spiked club in hand.

“HAHA!” Qin Chuan roared with laughter, “Big Sis Man, you’re too impatient! Wait for me!”

He charged over.

Meanwhile, Mad Saber gazed at Ling, “Both of us fought Big Sis Man in the Dead Dimension, but we weren’t a match for her. But we’ve never fought. So, let’s compete today?”

Ling replied indifferently, “How?”

Mad Saber smiled, “We’ll see who can kill a Sage first!”

Ling nodded, “Alright!”

He transformed into a ray of white light that shot forward.

Meanwhile, Mad Saber drew his saber, and he took it in both hands before charging at the nearest Sage.

Meanwhile, the monkey howled furiously, and then he slammed his palms down. In an instant, the space in a huge area shook violently, and then the monkey’s figure charged forward like a mountain at the Sages in the distance.

The Devil Monarch and the others’ expressions turned extremely unsightly.

They hadn’t expected this!

While they still had a huge advantage, even if they could defeat Yang Ye and kill him, they would suffer heavy losses, truly severe losses!

Not a single opponent they were facing was ordinary!

Why had the Alliance of All and the other two paths dispatch all their Sages?

Because they didn’t want to give Yang Ye a chance, and they didn’t want to win a pyrrhic victory against Yang Ye. They hoped to pay the smallest price to annihilate Yang Ye. Yet now, Yang Ye suddenly had so many friends, and this threw a wrench in their plans!

However, they had no way back!

They had to see this battle to the end. The end was either one where Yang Ye died or they did!

The Devil Monarch’s eyes gradually turned icy cold, “Kill them! Don’t let a single one of them survive!”

Kill!

In an instant, almost a hundred Sages shot upward.

This battle wasn’t any inferior to the battle between all the races and the god race all those years ago!

Yang Ye gazed at An Nanjing, and the latter nodded slightly. After that, they vanished on the spot, and they were in front of the Devil Monarch when they appeared again! The latter was terrified when he witnessed this!

He didn’t fear a one on one battle against Yang Ye or An Nanjing!

However, he was extremely terrified of a battle against both of them at once!

Obviously, they wanted to annihilate him without giving him a chance to survive!

The expressions of the Sages around the Devil Monarch changed as well, and they were about to lend him a hand. However, it was too late because Yang Ye and An Nanjing attacked too quickly!

The Devil Monarch was no ordinary expert, so his reaction was extremely quick. At the instant Yang Ye and An Nanjing appeared before him, a strand of terrifying black energy surged out from him, and then a huge tombstone appeared in front of him.

Meanwhile, a vicious glow flashed through An Nanjing’s eyes. She held Elysium in her right hand as she stabbed it forward, and it stabbed straight into the tombstone.

Bang!

A terrifying wave of energy rippled forth.

The tombstone started to crack open!

Meanwhile, An Nanjing stomped her right foot down, and it slammed straight against Elysium’s handle!

Bang!

Elysium cracked apart the entire tombstone. Meanwhile, a ray of sword energy soundlessly appeared behind the Devil Monarch. The latter was horrified, and he slammed both his palms down.

Bang!

A terrifying wave of energy rippled out with him at its center. An Nanjing and Yang Ye were blasted away, but at the instant that happened, Elysium suddenly left An Nanjing’s grasp while Yang Ye’s sword shot forward like a bolt of lightning.

Hiss! Hiss!

The Devil Monarch’s figure stiffened.

Elysium was in his chest, and Yang Ye’s sword was in his back!

Yang Ye and An Nanjing’s joint forces had annihilated the Devil Monarch!

The Devil Monarch looked at them with a slightly blank gaze in his eyes, “Formidable…”

Bang!

The Devil Monarch’s body exploded apart, and then the sword and Elysium flew back to their respective owners.

The Barbaric King, Spirit God, and Shaman Emperor converged together.

At this moment, they truly realized that they were unable to deal with Yang Ye and An Nanjing’s joint forces on their own. Their joint forces were truly too terrifying!

Yang Ye gazed at An Nanjing, “Are you alright?”

An Nanjing closed her eyes slowly, and a long time passed before she said, “I can still fight!”

Yang Ye cracked a smile, “If it wasn’t for me, you may become a peerless expert like the Unfettered One, but you’re very likely to die with me today!”

She gazed at him, “We’ll die together!”

Yang Ye roared with laughter, and it reverberated through the world like a thunderclap.

A short while later, Yang Ye transformed into a ray of light that shot upward while An Nanjing followed behind him.

At the same time, the Barbaric King, Spirit God, and Shaman Emperor attacked in unison while over a dozen top-rate Sages remained by their side.

In the Primordial Pagoda.

Snowy was absolutely anxious. She was asking the Primordial Pagoda for help, but it couldn’t do anything. It was a divine weapon, but while it was strong, it needed to be in the hands of someone to display that strength.

But Yang Ye hadn’t been able to fully grasp it. So, if it was made to fight those Sages on its own, it could never accomplish that. Unless those Sages came inside the pagoda.

However, the Primordial Pagoda had realized the situation Yang Ye was in, and it was madly utilizing Primordial Violet Energy to repair Yang Ye’s absolutely damaged body. Besides that, it had realized that it must let Yang Ye take full control of it!

Before this, it hadn’t given that much thought, and neither had Yang Ye. Yet now, Yang Ye was facing so many formidable enemies, and it made the pagoda feel threatened. It would rise and fall with Yang Ye!

When Yang Wudi forcefully placed it within Yang Ye, it had merged into one with Yang Ye’s body. So, if Yang Ye died, then even if it survived, it would suffer damages!

Snowy grew even more anxious when even the Primordial Pagoda couldn’t help!

In the end, she instinctively gazed at Tian Xiu who’d been standing silently at the side!

Tian Xiu gazed at Snowy, and then Snowy flew over to her. Snowy embraced Snowy and rubbed Snowy’s head gently while she muttered, “I can’t, I can’t. I really can’t… A’Xiu can’t, can’t help, can’t help…”

Snowy gazed at her with bewilderment.

Tian Xiu seemed like she’d lost her soul, “T-There are even stronger people… If A’Xiu helps, B-Big Brother will die!”

Even stronger enemies!

…

In the endless black hole in the distance.

The glowing door Yang Ye found the other day was trembling slightly.

A long time passed before a phantom walked out slowly from the other side.

The phantom glanced at the surroundings, and his gaze passed through space and swept through the entire large universe.

A long time passed before the phantom said, “Compared to the void spirit race of all those years ago, the living beings of the large universe are truly weak now!”

The phantom’s voice turned quite ferocious at this point, “Void Spirit Maiden, you sacrificed yourself and the living beings of the large universe to seriously injure me, forcing my undying race to retreat from this large universe and fall into deep sleep for hundreds of thousands of years. Now, can anyone in this large universe stop my undying race? Hahaha!”

The phantom’s laughter was filled with madness.

The undying race had endured this grievance for hundreds of thousands of years.
