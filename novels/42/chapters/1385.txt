Chapter 1386 – A Face!

The pig-riding young woman glared fiercely at Yang Ye, grabbed him by the shoulder, and pressed down. A powerful wave of force assaulted Yang Ye, and he was instantly pushed down.

“Don’t let her escape! Please!” Her voice resounded in Yang Ye’s mind while his figure shot down, and she sounded anxious as she implored him to help.

Yang Ye looked up and saw her take a step forward, and then Rebirth Rank saber intent surged out explosively from within her. The terrifying saber intent she emanated enveloped all 9 of the experts in the sky above, and then she charged at them.

1 against 9!

Even though she was an extremely monstrous genius, it was obviously impossible for her to fight 9 on her own. So, she started to suffer injuries from the moment the battle began.

Yang Ye withdrew his gaze, took a deep breath, and then looked up. The shadow had arrived less than 300m away from him.

He wasn’t joking earlier; he was serious about what he’d said to the pig-riding young woman just now. If he could choose, he would rather face Lian Suyao’s group. Even if he had to fight 9 on his own.

Why? Because this shadow was too terrifying.

He’d only just descended here when the Primordial Pagoda actually sent him a warning.

The Primordial Pagoda wouldn’t warn him when he faced ordinary danger. After all, it hadn’t warned him when he met Jian Xu and the black demonic dragon. Yet now, it had given him a warning. Since he came to the Radiant Dimension, the Primordial Pagoda had warned him on 2 separate occasions. The first was when he encountered Qiong Qi, and the 2nd was Lady. Both of them were extraordinarily terrifying existences.

What exactly is that thing? It actually made the Primordial Pagoda give me a warning?

He found out very soon. Because it was less than 30m away from him now.

A face!

Yang Ye saw a human face within the white ball of light that had appeared before him. It was a female face. The hairs on Yang Ye’s body stood on end when he saw it. The woman’s face was ghastly pale and covered in madness and ferocity. Her eyes were blood red, and they emanated boundless resentment, baleful energy, and the slaughter intent!

Yang Ye was someone who’d comprehended slaughter intent as well, and his slaughter intent and baleful energy would be extremely terrifying once he went mad. However, it was much inferior when compared to the slaughter intent and baleful energy before him. Moreover, the face was filled with resentment.

The resentment it possessed was too strong. It was countless times stronger than the negative emotions that Jian Wuji had left behind on Sword God Mountain.

Most importantly, the slaughter intent emanated from it wasn’t at the Rebirth Rank, it was at the peak of the Quasi Returnal Rank.

Peak Quasi Returnal Rank sword intent. Moreover, there was another form of intent being emanated from the face, and it was resentment. The resentment it emanated had solidified, and if it were considered as an intent, it would be comparable to a Quasi Returnal Rank intent.

2 types of Quasi Returnal Rank intents!

It could be said that this face was stronger than Jian Xu, and it wasn’t just a little bit stronger.

Yet now, he had to stop her.

Stop her!

Stop her my ass! Yang Ye couldn’t help but curse in his heart. She really thinks too highly of me.

Even though he wasn’t confident, he still had to do something. Because he could sense that regardless of whether it was the pig-riding young woman or Nether Maiden, all of them were very anxious and concerned. In other words, this face was extremely important to them.

I have to stop it! Yang Ye took a deep breath, took a step forward, and the Sword God’s Seal lit up on his forehead. After that, Rebirth Rank sword intent surged out madly from within him before he took another step forward. His sword intent immediately started to condense, and it only took an instant for a terrifying wave of force to erupt from him and slam against the face.

Sword intent at the brink!

Yang Ye naturally didn’t dare act carelessly at all when facing the terrifying face before him, and he’d immediately utilized the Brink Laws with his sword intent.

Meanwhile, a wave of terrifying energy suddenly erupted from the face, and it instantly slammed against Yang Ye’s sword intent.

Bang!

A rumbling explosion resounded, and then Yang Ye was blasted over 3km away!

Bang!

It didn’t take long for an explosion to resound from afar. Yang Ye looked over and saw that the aftershock from the collision had been obliterated, and the face had transformed into a beam of light that was charging at him. It was so swift that he couldn’t even see it clearly!

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly. He glanced downwards and saw Nether Maiden and the others were charging up in his direction. So, he just had to keep the face busy for a moment longer!

Yang Ye pondered deeply for an instant before he shook his left wrist slightly. The Sword Precursor within the ancient sheath was exchanged for Heaven’s Gravestone. He held tightly onto Heaven’s Gravestone while his profound energy surged madly before flowing into the ancient sheath.

He naturally didn’t dare to use the true form of Heavenrend. Jian Xu had been able to resist it that day, and this face was even stronger than Jian Xu. So, the face might be unharmed by his attack, and if that happened, then he would be in trouble.

Yang Ye held tightly onto the hilt of his sword while profound energy surged madly within him. The veins throughout his right arm had bulged, and they seemed like tiny snakes and made his arm seem quite terrifying.

The face was growing closer and closer, and it didn’t take long for the face to arrive 30m away from Yang Ye.

A wisp of ferocity flashed through Yang Ye’s eyes as he stomped his right foot down, and then his figure shot forward like a cannonball. Yang Ye swiftly drew his sword and swung it once he got close to the face.

750 overlapped Heavenrends!

At this moment, he could execute 750 Heavenrends overlapped together, and that was his limit!

Meanwhile, 2 blood red beams of light shot out from the face, and they slammed against Yang Ye’s sword.

Bang!

The space around them trembled violently, and then collapsed. But it only took an instant for it to be repaired by the Laws of the Heaven Dao. Meanwhile, Yang Ye had been blasted over 6km away, and the face was merely blasted around 1km away.

Yang Ye’s countenance was pale, and there was a wisp of scarlet red on the corner of his mouth while a solemn expression filled his eyes. What exactly is that thing? He could sense that it was attacking instinctively. In other words, it was an instinctive reaction when it sensed danger.

If it really had a consciousness, then it would definitely be extremely terrifying!

At this moment, the face seemed to be angry and grew even more ferocious.

Roar!

Suddenly, it looked up and roared with fury. In an instant, the space in an area of over 20,000km shook violently as if it was about to collapse.

Yang Ye’s eyelids twitched at the sight of this. It wasn’t just terrifying; the face was quite mysterious as well!

What exactly is it? Why are Nether Maiden and the others trying to suppress this human face? A string of questions flashed through Yang Ye’s mind, but he had no answer for it.

Suddenly, the face gazed at Yang Ye. Yang Ye was shocked by this, and the profound energy within him surged madly as he sheathed Heaven’s Gravestone. He was ready to draw it at any moment.

As expected, the face shot explosively in Yang Ye’s direction. During this process, numerous strands of blood red energy flowed out from around it. More and more energy flowed out from it, and the energy covered an area of almost 3km when the face arrived 300m before Yang Ye. However, the energy was still growing and was on the verge of completely enveloping Yang Ye!

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly while solemness filled his eyes. He didn’t dare act carelessly at all. He immediately stomped his right foot down and transformed into a ray of light that shot towards the blood red energy.

A wisp of ruthlessness flashed through Yang Ye’s eyes when he arrived less than 30m away from the face, and then he drew his sword and swung it.

Om!

A sword howl resounded as a beam of sword energy flashed forward.

Bang!

After that, an explosion resounded through the sky. Yang Ye watched with shock as his sword energy was instantly obliterated, and then a beam of blood red light shot towards him.

The blood red beam of energy hadn’t even arrived before him, yet the powerful force it carried caused the space around Yang Ye to crack apart. Moreover, Yang Ye was even forced backwards by it. It didn’t take long for the beam of blood red light to arrive in front of Yang Ye. Suddenly, a ray of cold light flashed, and an ice shield appeared before Yang Ye.

Bang!

The beam of blood red energy slammed against the ice shield. The ice shield trembled violently before being obliterated, but the beam of blood red energy hadn’t vanished. Meanwhile, a woman in an ice blue dress appeared in front of Yang Ye, and then it wasn’t long before Nether Maiden, Boundary Maiden, Light Maiden, and Oblivion Maiden appeared before Yang Ye!

Yang Ye heaved a sigh of relief when he saw them. He truly didn’t want to continue fighting the face. Because unless he used the true form of Heavenrend, he would only be bashed up without the ability to fight back. Fortunately, Nether Maiden and the others had rushed over. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

They didn’t speak a single word. The woman in an ice blue dress took a step forward. In an instant, the temperature here plummeted, and then a wave of cold air appeared around the face. The cold air instantly froze the face. However, it didn’t take long for the face to slam against the ice, causing it to crack apart in an instant!

“Seal!” Meanwhile, Boundary Maiden’s voice resounded abruptly. It didn’t take long for a barrier to cover the ice, and then the ice was instantly fortified.

“Ice!” The voice of the woman in the ice blue dress resounded, and then countless ice crystals covered the barrier in an instant.

Meanwhile, they appeared around the face that was now covered in ice. They nodded to each other, stretched their hands forward in unison, and then a wave of energy covered the face. After that, they took it with them as they descended slowly.

Suddenly, something unexpected occurred. A figure flashed out from a distant point in space, and then a dazzling ray of light slammed against the ice that sealed the face/

Bang!

The ice shattered into bits, and the face transformed into a ray of light that shot up into the sky.

Nether Maiden and the others’ faces instantly became hideous when they witnessed this.
