Chapter 1384 – Will You?

She can’t suppress it much longer? Yang Ye frowned while bewilderment filled his eyes. What are they doing down there?

A moment of silence ensued, and then a pig-riding woman gazed at Light Maiden and said, “Seventh Sister, you head down there.”

Light Maiden nodded slightly, and then she transformed into a ray of light that vanished down below.

Only Nether Maiden and the pig-riding young woman remained here.

2 against 6.

Lian Suyao and Hua Tianyuan exchanged glances. It didn’t take long for them to simultaneously vanish on the spot. One of them charged at the pig-riding young woman and the other charged at Nether Maiden. Besides that Su Daoming and the others followed closely behind Hua Tianyuan.

5 against 1! ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Yang Ye suddenly stood up. He would naturally not just watch as 5 of them ganged up on Nether Maiden. However, Nether Maiden spoke abruptly when Yang Ye was about to attack, “Recover for now. Listen to me.”

As soon as she finished speaking, Nether Maiden stretched her hand forward.

Swoosh!

A pitch black iron chain shot forward like a bolt of lightning, and she grabbed it and swung it horizontally. In an instant, the entire sky was covered in images of chains, and they enveloped Hua Tianyuan’s group.

She fought 5 on her own!

Yang Ye clenched his hands and was considering if he should lend her a hand. Suddenly, the pig-riding young woman said, “Stop watching and quickly recover. You’ll have a chance to help later!”

As soon as she finished speaking, she paid no further attention to Yang Ye and just shot towards Lian Suyao.

Yang Ye remained silent for an instant, and then he sat down cross-legged on the ground.

He’d recovered by around 30% now, and his profound energy had recovered by around 20%. So, even if he joined the battle, he would be of no help. The important matter at hand was to recuperate.

Around 15 minutes later, Lian Suyao turned to glance at Nether Maiden and Hua Tianyuan’s group. Her face instantly turned gloomy when she saw that they still hadn’t been able to kill Nether Maiden. She’d thought that since they were fighting her 5 against 1, they would be able to kill her quickly. However, she hadn’t expected that they would have failed to kill her swiftly and were even locked in battle with her.

Lian Suyao was silent for an instant, and then her figure flashed and dodged the pig-riding young woman’s attack before she said, “Hua Tianyuan, if we continue holding back, then not to mention 1 permit, even leaving with our lives would be a problem. Even if we can drag out the battle and kill them, we wouldn’t be able to leave the Radiant Dimension. You should be very well aware of how many are rushing towards here right now!”

Hua Tianyuan glanced at Lian Suyao and said, “Then let’s stop holding back!”

“Alright!” Lian Suyao nodded. She stretched her palms out flat, and then clasped them together. After that, a terrifying aura surged out from within her. As soon as that happened, she suddenly pushed her intertwined hands forward in the pig-riding young woman’s direction.

Bang!

A strand of invisible force rippled out from her arms, and it shattered the space before it.

The pig-riding young woman’s expression remained calm and composed, and she just slammed her spiked club forward.

Bang!

A muffled explosion resounded, and then the pig-riding young woman was blasted 300m away.

But it only took a moment for her to shoot forward like a bolt of lightning. In an instant, she arrived before Lian Suyao, and then she swiftly slammed her spiked club down at Lian Suyao.

Bang!

A muffled explosion resounded as Lian Suyao was blasted around 1km back.

Lian Suyao’s face became gloomy. She didn’t waste her breath and just immediately charged forward at the pig-riding young woman.

Meanwhile, Hua Tianyuan and the others stopped holding back. They executed their best techniques, causing Nether Maiden to start being suppressed.

Yang Ye’s face fell at the sight of this, and he stood up slowly before walking slowly in Hua Tianyuan’s group’s direction. At the same time, the ancient sheath appeared in his right grasp while a sword was sheathed within it.

Hua Tianyuan and the others noticed Yang Ye walking in their direction. Their expressions changed immediately, and they stopped attacking.

Their expressions changed once more when they saw Yang Ye holding that sword in his grasp, and then Nether Maiden watched with bewilderment as all of them retreated over 3km back!

At this moment, Lian Suyao had stopped attacking as well. She stared fixedly at Yang Ye. Besides seriousness, there was a trace of fear in her eyes.

Yang Ye walked over to Nether Maiden’s side, glanced at Hua Tianyuan’s group and said, “I haven’t recovered completely, but I can still draw my sword once. Which one of you wants to try it?”

The corners of Hua Tianyuan and the others’ eyes twitched.

Who would do it?

Who would dare to do it?

In any case, they wouldn’t dare to do that. They hadn’t forgotten how Yang Ye had killed Jiang Yuechen with a single swing of his sword.

When he saw them remain quiet, Yang Ye gazed at Lian Suyao, “Will you?”

Lian Suyao’s eyes narrowed slightly, and a cold glow flickered within them. However, she didn’t speak. It felt extremely dangerous to her. She was very well aware that she would die or suffer heavy injuries if she tried to resist that attack. Regardless of whether she died or suffered injuries, it wasn’t an outcome that she wanted.

Yang Ye didn’t act overbearingly. He nodded right away and said, “Looks like all of you need time to think. That’s fine, I’ll give you that time. You can have as much time as you like. Think slowly. I’m right here, and I’ll absolutely not leave. You can step forward once you’ve decided which one of you will do it.”

Hua Tianyuan and the others’ faces became quite unsightly when they heard Yang Ye.

Being deterred by a single person was naturally extremely humiliating to them. However, if they didn’t accept it, then they might have to lose their lives instead!

Hua Tianyuan and the others didn’t attack, so Yang Ye naturally didn’t as well. He was keeping it to threaten them. It would kill someone if he swung his sword, but then it would pose no further threat to the others who were still alive. At that time, they would really fight desperately with their lives on the line.

Since both sides didn’t attack, they were at a stalemate.

The pig-riding young woman came over to Yang Ye and Nether Maiden’s side. She sized up Yang Ye and nodded. She didn’t say anything because she felt that there was no need to say anything when it came to Yang Ye.

Yang Ye asked solemnly, “What exactly are all of you doing?!”

Presently, even an idiot would be able to realize that they were doing something in the Radiant Dimension, and it was definitely not anything minor.

A moment of silence ensued before Nether Maiden spoke in a low voice, “You’ll find out in a while.”

“Fine!” Yang Ye nodded and asked, “Where’s Blind Maiden? Did she not return?”

The pig-riding young woman gazed at Yang Ye and asked, “You know our third sister?”

Yang Ye nodded slightly, and then he briefly described how he met Blind Maiden on Dark Hell Continent.

“No wonder she hadn’t shown herself throughout these years!” The pig-riding young woman spoke softly, and then she fell silent.

Yang Ye asked, “Did she not return?” If Blind Maiden were here, wouldn’t all of the experts here be nothing but trash?

Nether Maiden replied, “She got here a long time ago!”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Then is she not going to help?”

Nether Maiden shook her head slightly, “She already has. If she hadn’t, then it wouldn’t be these fellows that were here right now, it would be the experts of the large world.”

“I understand now!” Yang Ye nodded. Obviously, she was dealing with even more formidable experts, and they had to deal with these fellows who were weaklings in Blind Maiden’s eyes.

Yang Ye asked, “Around how long will it take for you to complete what you’re doing here?”

Nether Maiden spoke in a low voice, “3 days!”

The corners of Yang Ye’s mouth twitched. 3 days!

In other words, they had to stand on guard here for 3 days. There would definitely be countless experts that rushed over here in the next 3 days. Moreover, they would definitely get stronger as more arrived!

Yang Ye asked, “How many of you are here?”

Nether Maiden replied, “6!”

Yang Ye asked, “Will the others rush back here too? For example, your eldest sister and second sister?”

Nether Maiden shook her head, “I don’t know if our eldest sister will be back, but second sister will definitely not be coming.”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Why?”

She replied in a low voice, “You’ll find out soon.”

Yang Ye felt speechless.

Meanwhile, the pig-riding young woman suddenly said, “If you’re afraid, you can just leave.”

Yang Ye couldn’t help but frown. He gazed at her and said, “Saying that is quite tasteless.”

He was quite displeased right now. Was he afraid? Would he still be standing here if he were afraid? Even though they were targeting him as well, could anyone find him if he hid himself? The reason he was still here was because of Nether Maiden and the others. Because they’d stepped forward and helped him when the 4 great clans and the Alliance of Guardians besieged White Deer Academy.

Now that they were in trouble, how could he just leave?

But the pig-riding young woman had spoken such words, so it naturally displeased him quite a bit.

Nether Maiden glanced at the pig-riding young woman and said, “Why speak such hurtful words?”

The pig-riding young woman puckered her lips and said, “I can’t even joke around?”

Yang Ye shook his head. He wasn’t really angry. He knew that she was quite a casual and careless person after all. Yang Ye didn’t linger on the matter and looked up at Hua Tianyuan’s group, “3 days. In other words. We have to stand on guard here for 3 days?”

Nether Maiden nodded, “Yes.”

Yang Ye asked, “What if we can’t?”

Nether Maiden spoke in a low voice that carried an indisputable tone, “We have to, no matter what!”

Yang Ye was about to speak when Nether Maiden gazed at him, “I didn’t want you to get mixed up in this matter. However, it’s pointless to say that now. You’re strong, and you’ll definitely be a huge help to us if you stay. Just remember that no matter what happens, you can’t allow anyone to head down there and disturb them. Please!”

Yang Ye looked down below. The area below was enveloped by a mysterious force, so others couldn’t discern the situation there at all. Yang Ye remained silent for an instant before he nodded, “I’ll try my best.”

He knew that what Boundary Maiden and the others were doing down there was extremely important to the women from the Nether Pavilion.

Nether Maiden nodded.

Bang!

Nether Maiden was just about to speak when an even louder explosion resounded abruptly from below, and then the space in an area of over 30,000km started to tremble violently.

“We can’t hold on much longer!” Boundary Maiden’s voice came from below again, and there was a trace of anxiousness in her voice.

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

Nether Maiden and the pig-riding woman’s expressions changed when they heard this, and then they exchanged glances.

“You head down there!”

“You head down there!”

Both of them spoke simultaneously.

The pig-riding young woman spoke solemnly in an indisputable tone, “You go!”

Nether Maiden glanced at her and Yang Ye, and then she said, “Be careful!”

As soon as she finished speaking, Nether Maiden’s figure shook and vanished on the spot.

Suddenly, a few terrifying auras appeared from afar. The owners of these auras were still over 20,000km away, but their auras had already arrived at the Radiant Dimension.

More had arrived!
