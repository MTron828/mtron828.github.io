Chapter 2610 – Try Me!

Blood Maiden couldn’t help but chuckle while Yang Ye felt quite embarrassed instead.

His name didn’t seem to be important enough!

Meanwhile, the voice suddenly said, “Leave the Void World! Otherwise…”

Suddenly, Yang Ye vanished on the spot.

Hiss!

A ray of sword energy flashed.

A moment later, the space before Blood Maiden cracked open, and then Yang Ye walked out from there. There was something pitch black in his grasp, and it was completely covered by sword intent and sword energy.

Blood maiden glanced at the pitch black ball, “We’re only here to look for something, so can you give us passage?”

The ball suddenly trembled, “Damnable humans! You’ll pay for this!”

Blood Maiden wanted to say more, but Yang Ye frowned, and then his sword energy started to search through it.

“AH!” A shrill cry resounded.

Suddenly, a few powerful auras emerged from the surroundings.

Yang Ye’s frown deepened. Yang Ye took a step forward, and then strands of sword energy rippled out!

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!

Huge holes were ripped open throughout space, and explosions resounded incessantly within those holes!

Yang Ye didn’t kill him. After all, they were here to look for Sky Maiden and not to fight. If they could resolve this peacefully, then there was no need to make enemies!

Yang Ye withdrew his sword intent and sword energy, and the space here immediately started to heal. A short while later, a black shadow with a pitch black cane appeared before Yang Ye.

It wasn’t in the form of a human!

Yang Ye gazed at the shadow. Finally, someone who had authority was here.

The shadow said, “Human, this is the Void World!”

Yang Ye nodded, “I know. I’m just here to look for someone and have no ill intent! So, please grant us passage!”

The shadow laughed coldly, “No ill intent? Just stepping foot in here is ill intent to us. Human, I don’t want to waste my breath on you. I’ll give you ten breaths of time to leave. Otherwise, I’ll…”

Suddenly, Yang Ye appeared before the black shadow, and its voice stopped abruptly!

A terrifying aura swept out from the shadow, but it only took a moment for the aura to vanish without a trace.

The surroundings instantly fell silent!

Because Yang Ye’s sword was pressed against the shadow’s throat.

Yang Ye stared at the shadow, “I think that we should talk about this. Don’t you think so too?”

A moment of silence ensued, and then the shadow nodded slightly, “Communicate, yes, we should!”

Yang Ye nodded and lowered his sword, “My sister came here, but we lost contact with her. So, we’re here to look for her. It’s naturally great if you have information on her, and we can search ourselves if you don’t. Of course, I guarantee that I won’t act rashly here or damage your world.”

The black shadow spoke solemnly, “Is your friend a human too?”

Yang Ye nodded. He gazed at Blood Maiden, and she flicked her finger. A moment later, Sky Maiden’s figure appeared before the black shadow!

The shadow exclaimed, “It’s her!”

Yang Ye was delighted, “You know her?”

The black shadow fell silent.

Yang Ye said, “We’ll leave once we find her!”

The shadow replied, “She entered the Void Space. Besides the Void Lord, no one else can go in there. Even if you get in there, it’s impossible to survive. So, she’s probably dead!”

Yang Ye and Blood Maiden’s faces fell.

Meanwhile, Blood Maiden said, “We want to enter the Void Space.”

Yang Ye gazed at the black shadow, “It shouldn’t be a problem, right?”

The shadow replied, “Allow me to be honest, that place is very dangerous. Even we cannot rashly enter that place. If you enter, it’s very likely that you won’t ever make it out.”

Yang Ye grinned, “It’s fine. Just let us in. We’ll take responsibility for whatever happens.”

The shadow replied indifferently, “Please go ahead.”

He flicked his finger and a pitch black hole appeared before them.

The shadow said, “It leads straight to the Void Space.”

Yang Ye glanced at the shadow and entered it with Blood Maiden.

As soon as they entered, the hole immediately closed.

A short while later, they appeared in a gray world, and Yang Ye sensed no signs of life here. The surroundings were simply an expanse of boundless emptiness!

Yang Ye frowned as he felt it was a little strange!

Blood Maiden spoke solemnly, “This is just one of the many parts of space here! We must search them all.”

Suddenly, the entire world warped, and then strands of strange energy appeared in the surroundings!

This energy seemed like it would blast them into bits!

Blood Maiden said, “It’s the spirit of this space!”

Yang Ye nodded, and then he took a step forward and unleashed the Sword Domain. Along with the Sword Domain enveloping the area, the spatial fluctuations and mysterious energy in the surroundings were instantly suppressed!

However, Yang Ye’s face grew even more solemn!

The space around them was suddenly covered in cracks, and then cold winds seeped out from the cracks.

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!

Along with the arrival of the cold winds, the tearing sounds resounded throughout the surroundings. At the same time, the space enveloped by Yang Ye’s Sword Domain started exploding apart inch by inch.

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly, and then he flicked his finger. Countless rays of sword energy exploded apart with him at their center!

Rumble!

Explosions resounded incessantly.

A long time passed before the surroundings calmed down. However, both Yang Ye and Blood Maiden weren’t standing in the same expanse of space anymore!

Blood was seeping out incessantly from the corner of Yang Ye’s mouth!

Blood Maiden was in a slightly better state because Yang Ye had practically blocked off all the energy that came from the explosion.

Yang Ye wiped off the blood on the corner of his mouth and glanced at the surroundings. A moment later, the space in the surroundings warped as it had a while ago!

Again!

A wisp of killing intent flashed through Yang Ye’s eyes, and then Executor left the sheath on his waist and shot up into the sky.

Hiss!

It seemed like it was about to slice the world into two!

Executor sliced through everything, but it didn’t take long for the world to counterattack. The space around Yang Ye started to explode inch by inch, and the powerful force of these explosions ceaselessly swept toward Yang Ye and Blood Maiden!

Is it trying to take me down with it?

Yang Ye frowned. Are all these Void Spaces so unafraid of death?

Yang Ye didn’t have time to think. He issued a command in his heart and Executor returned to his grasp. A moment later, a crescent of sword energy slashed forward!

Bang!

A loud explosion resounded once more, and the entire world turned ethereal!

A long time passed before the surroundings gradually calmed down.Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Yang Ye and Blood Maiden were still on the spot, but they were in a new space!

Yang Ye wiped off the blood on the corner of his mouth, “Second Sister, this is the first space we arrived at!”

Blood Maiden nodded solemnly.

Actually, they’d never gone to a different part of space! Everything they’d experienced was just an illusion. No, it couldn’t be described as an illusion because the energy and his injuries were real!”

They had fallen into some sort of cycle!

An endless cycle!

Yang Ye had a solemn expression on his face because even with the Sword Domain, he couldn’t sense anything strange about this world!

It was very unusual!

Most importantly, even if he destroyed the space around him, he would still appear back at the same part of space!

They were trapped!

They were trapped by the Void Space?

Yang Ye shook his head. Just a part of space didn’t have much strength, and he could sense that this place wasn’t that strong!

In other words, it was very likely that someone else was trapping them here!

Yang Ye shot a glance at the sky. Meanwhile, the world started once more!

It was exploding apart inch by inch!

Yang Ye stood before Blood Maiden, and then countless strands of sword intent and sword energy surged out of him!

The Sword Domain Sphere!

He had no choice but to use force in this place. Because if he didn’t, he would fall into a passive position! Unless he had a better way to deal with this, he had no choice but to use force to deal with this place!

Even if destroying the place didn’t change anything!

A short while later, two waves of energy collided, and the entire world shattered.

Yang Ye and Blood Maiden still remained here, and a few breaths of time later, they appeared on the spot again!

The same expanse of space as before!

Blood Maiden spoke solemnly, “We’re trapped!”

Yang Ye nodded. Cracks had appeared around him, cracks that were almost unnoticeable. Fortunately, he had Primordial Violet Energy, so such injuries weren’t severe to him at all!

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings, and then he stabbed his sword into the ground with both hands!

Bang!

A wave of powerful sword energy rippled out, and the world around him started collapsing inch by inch!

Around ten breaths of time later, the surroundings returned to normal!

The world around them still remained, and so did Yang Ye and Blood Maiden!

They were trapped!

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings and withdrew the Universe Seal, the seal said to be capable of destroying all barriers and formations. It shot up into the air, and a wave of powerful and mysterious energy swept out from it!

But just a short while later, the mysterious energy vanished without a trace!

The Universe Seal floated down slowly from midair!

It didn’t work!

Yang Ye put it away, glanced at the surroundings, and said, “Master of the Void World. I’m very angry, and the consequences of that are very serious!”

A moment of silence ensued, and then a voice resounded, “Try me!”
