Chapter 2399 – Flying Swords!

She even wanted to eat Oxxy!

Snowy blinked, and she felt that this problem was very serious!

She glanced at Oxxy, and the latter thought for a moment and moved closer to Snowy. Oxxy felt slightly safer like this!

Snowy patted Erya on the shoulder to console her, and then she left the Primordial Pagoda. She intended to report the matter to Yang Ye because she felt that it was very serious!

Outside the Primordial Pagoda.

Yang Ye stood at the peak of the cliff. Suddenly, he opened his eyes, and then a ray of sword energy appeared 500km away.

A mountain was instantly sliced into half there!

However, nothing happened to the mountain, and it didn’t collapse. Because the sword had been too swift, it had been swift to the extreme!

He’d improved!

Yang Ye grinned. His flying swords were a little faster than before. While it was just a little, it was a very rare improvement. Now, even increasing its speed and strength by a little was absolutely difficult!

Yang Ye was about to continue training when Snowy appeared in front of him and started waving her claws quickly.

Yang Ye frowned a short while later.

He hesitated for a moment and summoned Erya. The latter cracked a smile, “Big Brother Yang, is there food for me now?”

Yang Ye was stunned.

Once she appeared here, both the old men stopped playing and gazed at her.

Yang Ye pulled Erya over to them and cupped his fist before he asked, “Seniors, she wants to eat demon beasts. What should I do?”

Actually, he really didn’t know what to do about her request. She was no human, so it was in her nature to eat demon beasts. Forcefully asking her to change that would be suppression of her nature, and that wouldn’t work for long!

Wu Ni nodded slightly to Erya and said, “What should you do? Get her demon beasts of course!”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

Erya’s eyes lit up instead because she felt they were quite sensible!

Meanwhile, Wu Ni added, “In the beginning, I felt that she shouldn’t be with you. Because it will suppress her nature. However, I think it may be a good thing. If she is allowed to just release her nature completely, then she would be a calamity for the demon race. Moreover, if she did that at her current level of strength, it would be a calamity for her too.”

Wu Ni seemed to have thought of something, and then he hurriedly gazed at Snowy, “Little fellow, where’s my Martial Qilin?”

Martial Qilin!

Snowy blinked to display that she didn’t know!

Wu Ni glared at Snowy, “Don’t feign ignorance! I’m talking about that demon beast who was playing with you!”

Snowy looked around, and no one knew what she was planning. Suddenly, Wu Ni moved his hand lightly, and the Martial Qilin within the Primordial Pagoda looked up before leaving the Primordial Pagoda and appearing outside.

Wu Ni seemed to visibly relax upon seeing the Martial Qilin. He’d almost forgotten that Erya was with Yang Ye!

Suddenly, Snowy pointed at the Martial Qilin and pointed at herself to say that it belonged to her!

Wu Ni glanced at Snowy, “Little Fellow, on what basis do you say that it’s yours? Are you trying to be shameless?”

Snowy pointed at it to say that it could make its own choice. After that, she withdrew another piece of fruit and displayed that the fruit would belong to the Martial Qilin if it chose her!

The Martial Qilin became quite conflicted.

As for Wu Ni, he had quite a strange expression on his face.

Meanwhile, Snowy blew lightly at the Martial Qilin. In an instant, a strand of pure spirit energy surged into it, and then it shuddered and seemed to feel extreme comfort!

Sprite Ascension!

Martial Ancestor and Wu Ni exchanged glances, fell silent for a moment, and then Martial Ancestor said, “Staying with her is better than staying with us! Moreover, the Martial Qilin chose that little girl, and staying with this little fellow is no different than staying with that little girl, right?”

Wu Ni fell silent for a long time, and then he gazed at the Martial Qilin, “The person you chose will be with them in the future, so you’ll see her if you stay with them.”

The Martial Qilin was delighted. It lowered itself before Wu Ni, and a short while passed before it stood up again and went over to Snowy’s side.

Snowy grinned and passed the fruit to the Martial Qilin. It didn’t hesitate to consume the fruit.

Meanwhile, Wu Ni suddenly asked, “That fruit was a gift from the old man with the bamboo chest too, right?”

Yang Ye nodded, “Senior, what is that fruit?”

Wu Ni replied indifferently, “The Chaotic Origin Fruit. It has practically gone extinct. Besides that old man, no one has any. It’s extremely helpful to demon beasts and Sprites. It can improve their bloodlines. While it only improves their bloodlines and doesn’t change it, it’s still extremely amazing. Once it is improved, and if they work hard, it’s very likely that they’ll be able to change their own bloodlines. In other words, they’ll be able to surpass their current bloodlines. In short, it can help them surpass their own bloodlines, so it’s ranked 2nd among all precious fruits!”

Suddenly, Snowy raised one of her claws to ask what the 1st was!

Wu Ni glanced at Snowy, “You’ll find out in the future!”

Snowy was at a loss for words.

Just like that, Snowy’s tricks had gotten Yang Ye another demon, the Martial Qilin! It was an infant as well, and it was at the Two World Realm. It was a mount that Wu Ni had specially found for An Nanjing. However, Yang Ye treated it as his own. After all, it was An Nanjing’s mount!

Meanwhile, Wu Ni glanced at Yang Ye and said, “Your flying sword from before is barely sufficient for you right now. However, it can be faster and stronger!”

Yang Ye was delighted and hurriedly said, “Senior, please provide me with guidance!”

Wu Ni replied indifferently, “The Sword Domain!”

The Sword Domain!

Yang Ye frowned. A short while later, a smile curled up on his lips, “Thank you!’

He shot over to the clouds once he finished speaking.

In the clouds, Yang Ye closed his eyes. In an instant, his figure turned ethereal!

The Sword Domain!

A moment later, the Sword Gourd shook violently by his waist, and then a ray of sword energy soundlessly appeared 500km away!

It was swift!

Yang Ye’s eyes were filled with excitement. It was almost 30% faster than anything he’d achieved before this!

The Sword Domain!

If he used the Sword Domain with it, the flying swords from the Sword Gourd would undergo a qualitative transformation in speed and strength! Of course, it exhausted much more energy as well, but it was worth it!

Presently, he could kill a Two World Realm expert 500km away with just a thought!

Yang Ye trained for a few more days, and then he left the cliff and went to Divine Martial City.

Cloud Residence!

He naturally hadn’t forgotten about his deal with the woman. She’d provided him information to locate An Nanjing, and in return, he should do his part and heal her.

Cloud Residence.

Right Sword and Left Sword greeted Yang Ye.

Right Sword bowed slightly to Yang Ye, “Young Master Yang, please wait a moment. She’ll be here in a moment.”

Yang Ye nodded and sat at the side. Left Sword frowned when she saw where Yang Ye was sitting, and she was about to say something but Right Sword stopped her!

She’d realized that the person before her wasn’t someone who was easy to deal with! So, it was best not to offend him!

Snowy glanced at them from Yang Ye’s shoulder, and then she withdrew a tanghulu and started licking it.

Yang Ye didn’t wait for a long time. Just a short while later, a middle aged man walked out of the bamboo house. Right Sword and Left Sword bowed slightly to him, and the middle aged man nodded without saying anything.

Right when he was about to leave, he suddenly gazed at Yang Ye. He was slightly stunned when he saw Yang Ye, and then he hesitated for a moment and asked, “Are you Yang Ye?”

Yang Ye gazed at him, “And who are you?”

The middle aged man grinned when he saw Yang Ye admit it, and he cupped his fist, “I’m the master of the Divine Martial Sect. I didn’t expect to see you here. If you’re free, please visit my sect and enjoy our hospitality!”

The Divine Martial Sect’s master!

Yang Ye glanced at the middle aged man and nodded, “Of course!”

The middle aged man grinned, “I have other matters to attend to. Farewell!”

He glanced at Snowy, and then he vanished into the distant sky.

The Divine Martial Sect!

Yang Ye glanced at the bamboo house, and he wondered who the woman called A’Leng actually was! He was quite curious!

Meanwhile, A’Leng walked out of the house and sat before Yang Ye. She smiled apologetically, “Sorry for making you wait!”

Yang Ye shook his head, “It’s fine!”

She asked, “You’ve been to the Martial Tomb?”

Yang Ye nodded, “Yes, and I’ve obtained information on her.”

A'Leng nodded slightly, “That’s good to hear.”

Yang Ye smiled, “Miss A’Leng, according to our agreement, I should heal you. So please give me your hand!”

A'Leng smiled and stretched out her hand. Yang Ye placed his right hand above her palm but didn’t touch her skin. His profound energy circulated, and then Primordial Violet Energy seemed out incessantly from his palm and converged into her body.

As they flowed into her, A’Leng’s face gradually turned quite red.

Right Sword and Left Sword instantly became extremely excited!𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

However, Yang Ye frowned because her body was like a bottomless hole!

Suddenly, a powerful aura appeared in the distant sky!

A Three World Realm expert!

A powerful aura enveloped Cloud Residence. At the same time, a voice came from afar, “Yang Ye, you killed many of us Guardians. It’s time to put an end to that enmity.”

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly and he knew they weren’t able to stop themselves from acting against him in the end!

Yang Ye was about to stop when she suddenly grabbed his hand, “Continue.”

She tapped her right foot down and spoke softly, “A’Da!”

Bang!

The ground suddenly cracked open, and then a robust man shot up into the air.

A Three World Realm expert!

A’Leng closed her eyes and said, “Until I’m fully cured, even a God can’t kill you!”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.
