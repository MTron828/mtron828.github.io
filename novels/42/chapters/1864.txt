Chapter 1865 – It’s Far From Enough!

Slaughter everyone!

Yang Ye’s voice was enhanced by profound energy, so it swept towards the surroundings like a thunderclap.

At this moment, countless people started to shoot out of the city.

Because they could sense that Yang Ye was on the verge of going berserk, and he would absolutely do as he said. As for whether he could accomplish it, it wasn’t important. The important thing was Yang Ye absolutely dared to try!

It didn’t take long for three breaths of time to pass!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye’s sword suddenly started trembling.

Suddenly, a ray of black light flashed up into the sky above the city, and then a middle aged man appeared not too far away from Yang Ye.

It was the Night Emperor!

He naturally had to show himself. Yang Ye had come to Night Assassin City on his own and challenged him in front of everyone. If he didn’t show himself, his reputation in Heaven Pillar Mountain would be ruined!

The Night Emperor glanced at Yang Ye, and a trace of complicated emotions flashed through his eyes. Yang Ye’s strength had really improved a little too quickly. Not long ago, when he first met Yang Ye, Yang Ye could only flee from him. Yet now, Yang Ye had the strength to kill him!

Everyone watching from the shadows was waiting for the battle to begin.

They wanted to see if Yang Ye or the Night Emperor would vanish from this world today!

Yang Ye gazed at the Night Emperor, “My second sister’s blood pearl. Hand it over and I’ll give you a quicker death!”

The Night Emperor gazed at Yang Ye for a while and said, “Why don’t you come get it if you can?”

Yang Ye stomped his right foot against the ground.

Boom!

His figure transformed into a ray of light that shot towards the Night Emperor. The stars trembled while countless rays of starlight surged down like a torrent before entering Yang Ye’s sword.

Countless experts were shocked and shot backwards.

Everyone moved backwards when facing the might of Yang Ye’s attack!

Even though the Night Emperor had an extremely solemn expression on his face, he was very calm. As one of the five Emperors, he had that level of composure.

The Night Emperor stretched out his hands and clenched them gently. In an instant, two black vortices appeared before him, and they rapidly expanded. In the end, they enveloped him.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye’s sword energy arrived before him.

Bang!

A terrifying invisible wave of energy erupted as soon as they collided, and it caused the surrounding space to ripple violently. As for the Night Emperor, he was blasted 30km away!

The Night Emperor had been blasted back with a single attack!

The Night Emperor looked down at his chest. It had cracked open, and blood was seeping out incessantly. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

He fell silent for a few breaths of time, and then he looked up at Yang Ye, “One attack! Go on! Continue!”

Yang Ye didn’t waste his breath. He just tapped his foot against the ground and soared up like a bird. It only took an instant for him to arrive above the Night Emperor, and then he held the golden sword with both hands and swung it down at the Night Emperor.

Rumble!

The buildings in an enormous area were instantly obliterated by the force within the attack.

The holy sword was too strong, so he couldn’t do as he did in the past and prevent all the energy from leaking out!

Meanwhile, the Night Emperor took a deep breath. This time, he didn’t choose to defend himself, and two black vortices appeared in his palm. A moment later, he pressed his palms together, and the vortices instantly merged into one before he transformed into a black pillar of light that charged up into the sky.

The sword energy and black light exploded apart in midair on contact.

Everyone watched as the Night Emperor’s figure crashed down to the ground while Yang Ye stopped himself after being pushed around 3km back. At this moment, Yang Ye was slightly sickly pale.

He hadn’t been injured by the Night Emperor, and it was caused by the backlash from his sword!

However, the Night Emperor was in a much worse state. The Night Emperor’s entire body was covered in injuries. Earlier, merely his chest had cracked open, yet now, his entire face had cracked open, and blood was flowing from the cracks! It was absolutely horrifying!

The Night Emperor wiped off the blood from the corner of his mouth and looked up at Yang Ye, “Do you still dare to swing your sword?”

His voice was very calm.

Everyone looked at Yang Ye. Did Yang Ye dare to swing his sword again? Everyone here was a peak expert. So, they were naturally able to discern that using the sword was like controlling a force he couldn’t control, and it would cause Yang Ye to suffer backlash.

Now, even though Yang Ye wasn’t at his limit, they knew that he wouldn’t dare to let himself reach his limit. Because if he used it again, he would definitely fall into a weak state. At that time, even if he could kill the Night Emperor, anyone here would be able to kill him with ease!

Yang Ye flipped his palm, and the golden sword was switched into the Sword Precursor.

A smile instantly curled up on the corners of the Night Emperor’s mouth. However, Yang Ye suddenly vanished on the spot and appeared before him, and then Yang Ye swung the Sword Precursor with both hands.

The Night Emperor’s reaction was very quick. He clenched his right fist tightly, and a black vortex flashed out from his fist before he slammed it forward.

Boom!

As soon as his fist collided with Yang Ye’s sword, the Night Emperor was blasted 3km away, and as soon as he stopped himself, Yang Ye had appeared before him and Yang Ye’s sword was descending towards him.

Just like that, the Night Emperor was pushed back over and over again while Yang Ye refused to give him a moment to catch his breath. The Night Emperor was practically unable to fight back against Yang Ye’s insane flurry of attacks, and he could only defend himself!

The Night Emperor was being suppressed!

If Yang Ye could be said to have relied on external forces to suppress the Night Emperor earlier, then he was using his own strength right now!

The Night Emperor was being pushed back repeatedly!

In the end, he couldn’t continue doing that, and he chose to risk his life against Yang Ye. At this moment, he’d given up on defending himself.

However, once he gave up on defending himself and started risking his life against Yang Ye, he realized that he’d made a mistake. Because Yang Ye’s physical body had fully surpassed his imagination. Especially Yang Ye’s recovery, it was simply heaven defying!

Around 15 minutes later…

Bang!

An explosion resounded, and then the Night Emperor was blasted backwards in midair. At the same time, one of his arms dropped to the ground while accompanied by a string of blood.

Boom!

As soon as he crashed to the ground, the Night Emperor didn’t even have the chance to stand up before a foot stomped on his chest and immobilized him.

He’s lost!

The Night Emperor had lost!

The entire city fell silent along with this.

At this moment, many people had complicated emotions in their hearts. Yang Ye, a young man who was less than 30 years of age, had defeated one of the five Emperors of Heaven Pillar Mountain. Yet they were people who’d lived for thousands or tens of thousands of years…

Sometimes, one couldn’t compare oneself with another. Because it would only bring pain and suffering!

Yang Ye waved his right hand, and the Night Emperor’s spatial ring flew into his grasp. Yang Ye scanned it, and then his face fell. Because Blood Maiden’s Quintessence Blood Pearl wasn’t in there.

Yang Ye looked down at the Night Emperor, “Where is it?”

The Night Emperor stared at Yang Ye in silence.

Yang Ye nodded, “You refuse to tell me, huh? Alright, I hoped you wouldn’t.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he flipped his palm, and a black iron chain appeared in his grasp. He flicked it, and it embedded itself in the Night Emperor’s shoulder blades. After that, Yang Ye grabbed the chain and dragged the Night Emperor out of the city.

Suddenly, the Night Emperor’s stomach expanded. Obviously, he intended to detonate himself.

However, a ray of sword energy suddenly entered his stomach, and then it stopped expanding.

His Dantian had been destroyed!

Just like that, Yang Ye dragged the Night Emperor out of the city.

It was an absolute humiliation for the Night Emperor.

Suddenly, an old man appeared before Yang Ye, “Yang Ye, aren’t you going a little too far?”

The old man wasn’t the only one who felt this way. Many others, who were watching from the shadows, felt that Yang Ye had gone a little too far.

“I’m going too far?” A ferocious smile curled up on the corners of Yang Ye’s mouth, “This is too far? No, it’s far from enough.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he ignored the old man and continued dragging the Night Emperor towards the city gates.

The old man intended to say something, but Yang Ye suddenly gazed at him, “Say another word and I’ll make you keep him company.”

The old man’s face turned gloomy, but he didn’t dare to say a word. He just shot an icy cold glance at Yang Ye before vanishing on the spot.

Just like that, Yang Ye dragged the Night Emperor to the city gates, and then he tossed the chain up and hung the Night Emperor above the city gates.

Yang Ye gazed at the Night Emperor and said, “I’ll ask you one last time. Where’s the blood pearl! Tell me and I’ll give you a swift death.”

The Night Emperor stared at Yang Ye, “Yang Ye, you won’t be able to live for long. The day will come when someone comes to take your life. At that time, you’ll definitely suffer much worse than this.”

Yang Ye nodded, “I love stubborn people like you. Come, let’s see how stubborn you can be today.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye’s sword started to move. After that, piece after piece of flesh vanished from the Night Emperor’s body…
