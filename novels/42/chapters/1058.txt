Chapter 1059 – Just Lou Qianxiao’s Death Isn’t Enough!

In Sky City.

Yang Ye was facing 5 Saints and an endless swarm of experts from Sky Divine Hall. Even though he was able to barely fight them with Heaven’s Gravestone’s help, he was in a disadvantaged situation.

Suddenly, 4 figures charged out from within the crowd in the distance, and they quickly charged into the group of experts from Sky Divine Hall before entering into battle with the Saints of Sky Divine Hall.

“Yang Ye! Leave now! Remember that so long as you’re alive, then Ocean of Clouds Academy and the Ancient Sword School will exist forever!” A voice resounded from the battlefield.

“Instructor Zhuo....” Yang Ye’s gaze was on those 4 figures, and there was a trace of surprise in his eyes. Because the 4 of them were Instructor Zhuo and the other 3 Saints that he’d driven out of Ocean of Clouds Academy. He hadn’t expected that they’d actually come to Sky City and would even help him!

Yang Ye took a deep breath and said, “Instructor Zhuo, all of you stand back!”

Instructor Zhuo and the others didn’t hesitate to retreat to Yang Ye’s side. Meanwhile, Yang Ye issued a command in his heart, and then over 3,000 rays of light swiftly shot out from the sword chest on his back and shot towards the experts from Sky Divine Hall. A moment of silence ensued, and then countless rays of light started flashing throughout the surroundings!

“AHHH!” Numerous shrill cries resounded incessantly, and then countless fountains of blood shot up into the air. In the end, all the blood surged into the blood red sword in Yang Ye’s grasp. This time, the torrent of blood surged incessantly and showed no sign of stopping!

A short while later, the rays of light vanished, and all the Saint Rank swords returned to the sword chest on Yang Ye’s back.

Meanwhile, only 2 Saints from Sky Divine Hall remained on the battlefield, and all the others had been slaughtered! Or it should be said that there weren’t many living beings left in the city.

After all, just the aftershock from the battle between Yang Ye and the Saints from Sky Divine Hall had obliterated a huge number of experts!

At this moment, countless people were begging for mercy, howling with terror, and cursing like madmen throughout the city.

Bang!

Suddenly, the entire city shook, and then the barrier of light that enveloped the city shattered into pieces.

The survivors in the city were overjoyed by this scene, and they fled madly out of the city!

The Sword Spirit appeared by Yang Ye’s side, “Let’s go!”

However, Yang Ye shook his head.

The Sword Spirit was stunned, and so were Instructor Zhuo and the others.

Yang Ye spoke seriously, “Instructor Zhuo, all of you return to Ocean of Clouds City immediately!”

“Yang Ye... there’s always hope for revenge while you’re still alive!”

Instructor Zhuo intended to say more, but Yang Ye waved his hand, “Instructor Zhuo, if you still recognize me as the dean, then return to the academy right now. As for me, I have my own choice!”

Meanwhile, the Sword Spirit suddenly spoke softly, “All of you leave!”

As soon as she finished speaking, she flicked her finger, and a ray of light enveloped them before they instantly vanished on the spot.

“Sword Spirit, you leave as well!” Yang Ye gazed at her and spoke softly, “I can’t drag you down with me again.”

“The Eye of the Heaven Dao won’t tolerate his existence in this world for long. We just have to leave and buy some time, and he will be forced to leave this world!” said the Sword Spirit.

Yang Ye shook his head and replied, “We can flee, but can the Ancient Sword School and Ocean of Clouds Academy flee? They can’t. Moreover, I don’t want to run. How can only Lou Qianxiao die for what they did to An Nanjing? I want Lou Qianyun and the entire Sky Divine Hall to pay!”

Yang Ye tore open his clothes as he spoke, and the Qiong Qi tattoo concealed beneath his skin instantly emerged from within. It seemed extremely ferocious, and it simply seemed like it desired to swallow the entire world!

The Sword Spirit suddenly grabbed Yang Ye’s arm, and there was extreme fear in her eyes as she gazed at the tattoo on Yang Ye’s chest. A short while passed before she shook her head, “I don’t know what that is, but I have no doubt that if you forcefully summon it, then you’ll definitely be the first one it kills.”

“I don’t have another choice!” Yang Ye shook his head. The Eye of the Heaven Dao was keeping Lou Qianyun busy right now, and he could flee. But what about Ocean of Clouds Academy and the Ancient Sword School? Just disregard them and flee on his own?

Moreover, he refused to allow An Nanjing to have suffered for nothing, and he refused to let both Daoist Gu and Jian Wuchen die for nothing!

Just Lou Qianxiao’s death was far from enough!

The Sword Spirit suddenly said, “You do have another choice!”

Yang Ye gazed at her, and it didn’t take long for him to understand what she meant. He immediately shook his head decisively, “I don’t want to harm you again!”

“You’re not the same anymore!” She continued, “Regardless of whether it’s your physical strength, your sword intent, or your realm of cultivation, all of them are countless times stronger than before. So, we won’t suffer the same consequences this time. Of course, there’ll definitely be some backlash. However, it will absolutely not be as severe as the last time, and it will definitely not be as severe as releasing that fellow within you.”

Yang Ye gazed at her for a short while, and then he nodded.

The Sword Spirit glanced at Yang Ye, and then she transformed into a ray of light that vanished on the spot. At the same time, an ancient sheath appeared in Yang Ye’s left hand while a sword appeared in his right hand!

The sword entered its sheath!

Om!

A sword howl pierced the sky!

At this moment, the entire prefecture heard that sword howl!

“That isn’t an Emperor Rank sword!” The red haired old man’s pupils constricted, and there was astonishment in his eyes.

In the sky above the city, Lou Qianyun stood there while the Eye of the Heaven Dao floated behind him. But at this moment, the Eye of the Heaven Dao wasn’t looking at him, it was looking at Yang Ye instead. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Lou Qianyun’s eyes narrowed slightly, and then his gaze descended onto the sword in Yang Ye’s grasp, “It actually surpasses the existing ranks when sword and sheath are united. Such a divine treasure has actually appeared in this world. Yang Ye, if you were a little stronger, then perhaps you might really be able to be a threat to me. But now... you’re still an ant!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Lou Qianyun slapped his palm down, and a palm shot down from the sky.

The palm seemed very calm, and the entire city wasn’t affected by it at all.

However, Yang Ye’s countenance instantly turned pale as a sheet. Obviously, that palm was focused on him alone!

“Slash!” Yang Ye’s sword left its sheath!
