Chapter 391 – Death Energy!

Bang!

An enormous and world shaking bang resounded while the entire Hidden Dragon Arena trembled violently. Countless strands of flames and electricity suddenly swept towards the surroundings. In next to no time, they had spread to the borders of the arena and collided forcefully against the barrier of light.

Bang!

Dense cracks instantly appeared on the barrier of light that enveloped the arena, and then the entire light barrier exploded into pieces under the astounded gazes of everyone in the surroundings.

The flames and electricity continued sweeping towards the surroundings, and it caused the spectators to be astounded.

Right at this moment, Qian Huan and Feng Xiu appeared here, and they lightly waved their right hands before the flames and electricity instantly vanished into nothingness.

“You regret it now, right?” Qian Huan suddenly said, “Even though his natural talent isn’t as monstrous as that little girl, it’s at the top in the entire continent. Now, you’ve seen his actual combat strength as well. So, do you regret your decision now?”

Feng Xiu’s eyelids twitched, and then he grunted coldly and said, “So what? His strength and natural talent are really not bad, but they are much inferior when compared to Luo Xue and that little girl. I can give him a chance to join my Clear River Sect if he’s able to defeat Luo Xue.”

Qian Huan shook his head. The Sect Master of Clear River Sect actually dispatched such a conceited and arrogant fellow here. Can’t this old fellow see that this kid doesn’t care about Ninth Rank Sects?

Actually, Qian Huan felt slightly regretful in his heart as well. Because he noticed that Yang Ye was truly a good ‘seedling’. Even though Yang Ye’s strength might be inferior to Luo Xue and An Nanjing, Yang Ye’s potential was huge. After all, Yang Ye was from a place like the southern territory where cultivation techniques and combat techniques were comparatively inferior!

If he had the fostering and guidance provided by a large sect, then even if he couldn’t become an extraordinary expert like the Sword Sect’s Founding Ancestor, he would definitely be able to become a sword cultivator who left his name in history!

However, Yang Ye’s lifespan was too short, and even old geezers like them went mad in order to obtain such treasures that could increase their lifespans!

Qian Huan sighed lightly before he shot his gaze towards the arena.

The arena was in a mess. A strand of flame and a bolt of violet lightning were in confrontation in the sky above the arena. On the other hand, Yang Ye and Luo Xue weren’t at the spots they stood before the collision, and they were on the ground at the edge of the arena!

Even with their extremely formidable physical bodies and extremely terrifying strengths, it was impossible for them to completely disregard the terrifying might of the Nether Ghostflame and Violetcloud Lightning.

After around 15 minutes had passed, both of them started moving at the same time, and then they slowly stood back up on their feet.

Their physical bodies were extremely terrifying, so while the aftershock from the collision between the Nether Ghostflame and Violetcloud Lightning had struck them, it had merely struck them but hadn’t caused any material harm to them.

Swish!

Right at this moment, the sound of wind being torn apart resounded, and then a trace of scarlet red suddenly appeared on Luo Xue’s chest....

The spectators in the surroundings were stunned when they witnessed this scene, but Yang Ye frowned instead. After he stood up just now, he’d utilized the Sword Control Technique to control the Hidden Sword and attack Luo Xue. His attack had succeeded, but it was actually unable to move an inch deeper after it pierced through the skin in front of Luo Xue’s chest!

As he gazed at that trace of scarlet red on his chest, a wisp of a savage expression instantly appeared on Luo Xue’s calm face. He gestured with his right hand and the Violetcloud Lightning instantly transformed into a bolt of lightning that shot into his head. In an instant, strands of electricity appeared all around him, and then he shouted as he smashed his right fist forward in Yang Ye’s direction!

It was like an enormous python of violet colored lightning shot out violently from within Luo Xue, and it carried a terrifying aura as it shot violently towards Yang Ye!

Yang Ye didn’t dare act carelessly when he saw this. He issued a command in his heart, and then the Nether Ghostflame flashed over to appear in front of him. After that, the Nether Ghostflame exploded apart with another command from him, and it transformed into a wave of flame that swept towards the violet lightning.

Bang!

They collided, and then another enormous explosion erupted!

Right at this moment, Yang Ye suddenly vanished on the spot, and he was already behind Luo Xue when he appeared again. A cold glow flashed as Dragonbone arrived at Luo Xue’s neck. However, the tip of his sword hadn’t even come into contact with Luo Xue’s skin when a strand of electricity suddenly blasted onto Yang Ye, causing Yang Ye to be instantly blasted over 15m away!

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly while he gazed at Luo Xue who seemed to be covered in a net of electricity. His ability to control the Violetcloud Lightning far surpasses my ability to control the Nether Ghostflame!“Yang Ye, needless to say, I really underestimated you in the past! I originally thought that the Violetcloud Lightning would be enough to deal with you, but I was wrong. Don’t worry, I won’t underestimate you from now on.” Luo Xue walked slowly towards Yang Ye. Strands of fine bolts of lightning flickered incessantly around him as he moved, and his imposing aura was shocking like that of a lightning god who had descended to the world!

Luo Xue stopped when he arrived 30m away from Yang Ye. After a moment of silence, Luo Xue’s figure suddenly shot forward explosively. He was like a bolt of lightning that instantly arrived in front of Yang Ye.

Yang Ye frowned and tightened his grasp on his sword. He was about to attack when a wisp of a savage expression flashed through Luo Xue’s eyes, and then Luo Xue said, “Explode!”

As soon as he spoke, a net of electricity instantly surged forward from within Luo Xue and enveloped Yang Ye and him.

Yang Ye held Dragonbone in his grasp while he stood within the net of electricity, and his aura was condensed to the limit. He was just about to destroy the net with a swing of his sword when a strand of extremely black energy suddenly surged out from within Luo Xue. The black energy moved extremely swiftly, and it instantly entered Yang Ye’s body.

Yang Ye’s pupils constricted while his body stiffened on the spot. At the same time, his hands, neck, and face instantly turned black. Moreover, everywhere the black energy passed within his body had instantly turned jet black as well....

The net of electricity dispersed, and the spectators were stunned when they witnessed the scene within it. Yang Ye has died just like that?

An Nanjing frowned slightly when she saw the state Yang Ye was in. She pondered briefly before she said, “Death Energy, I never expected that this utterly inhumane thing would appear once more in the world.”

As soon as she finished speaking, a wisp of a solemn expression had appeared in her eyes for the very first time.

Death Energy? What was Death Energy?

When a person had just perished, the vitality within the body would be converted into Death Energy. This Death Energy would remain in the body for some time before dispersing into the world.

It was extremely terrifying because it could directly put an end to a person’s vitality. Moreover, both profound energy and techniques were useless against it. Because strictly speaking, it wasn’t a form of energy....

It was extremely difficult to take control of Death Energy because the slightest mistake would cause the person to suffer backlash, and backlash represented death.

Because up until now, there hadn’t been a single thing on the continent that could resist Death Energy!

An Nanjing shook her head slightly as she gazed at Yang Ye’s pitch black eyes. Once Death Energy entered the body, then even a Saint Realm expert couldn’t rescue Yang Ye. What a pity... another person that might give me a pleasant surprise is gone!

Feng Xiu grunted coldly and said, “Once Death Energy has entered his body, it’s impossible to save him even for us. This is good as well. In any case, he wouldn’t be able to live for long. Since death would come sooner or later, this can be considered as a form of release!”

Qian Huan frowned when he heard this. This fellow is really too petty! But he did say something true, it’s impossible to save Yang Ye even for me. Even they were extremely fearful of Death Energy because nothing could resist it! Even a Natural Treasure couldn’t!~

But how did Luo Xue cultivate this Death Energy? After a moment of deep thought, Qian Huan’s gaze descended onto the enormous brush in Luo Xue’s grasp, and then realization instantly covered his face. If I’m not wrong, then it’s probably the Book and Brush of Judgment. Because only these two treasures are capable of drawing out Death Energy from a person who has just perished.

But how did they fall into Luo Xue’s hands? After all, they were the primary treasures utilized by the Nether God all those years ago!

Luo Xue glanced indifferently at Yang Ye, and then he flipped his palm and the Book of Judgment appeared there. He flipped it open to the second page, and the words ‘Yang Ye’ resided on the first row of the 2nd page. Luo Xue didn’t hesitate to move the Brush of Judgment down towards Yang Ye’s name....T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m
