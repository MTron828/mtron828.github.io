Chapter 2303 – Who Dares to Fight Against My Chopper?

Bai Zhixian shook her head slightly, “I don’t know.”

She paused for a moment and continued, “But I know he’s very strong.”

“Very strong?” Butcher glanced at Yang Ye and shook his head, “I think he’s very weak.”

Bai Zhixian replied indifferently, “Senior, you’re looking at him based on your current strength, so he’s naturally weak. If you don’t mind me asking, were you as strong as him when you were at his age?”

Butcher was stunned.

Bai Zhixian didn’t say another word and just vanished into the distance with Yang Ye in her arms.

Butcher shook his head and smiled, “All those years ago, who dared to fight against my chopper?”

…

Bai Zhixian carried Yang Ye all the way to the southernmost corner of the village. There was a very inconspicuous bamboo house there. Many animal bones were hanging outside the house, and there were some strange drawings there too.

Wang Erya was seated on the stairs outside the bamboo house and licking her Tanghulu.

Meanwhile, an old man walked out slowly from within the house.

The old man wore a wide black robe, and he held a long white cane. If one looked carefully, one would notice that the cane was a bone. The old man was very old, but his eyes were exceptionally sharp. It was as if they could see through everything.

The old man glanced at Bai Zhixian and Yang Ye, and then he said, “Please have a seat.”

Bai Zhixian spoke solemnly, “Senior, just be frank!”

The old man walked over to them, sized up Yang Ye, and said, “Sword intent, slaughter intent, madness intent… I haven’t seen the madness intent in a very long time!”

Bai Zhixian asked, “Senior, you’ve seen it before?”

The old man nodded slightly, “I have.”

He suddenly gazed at her and said, “I presume you’re here for Eternal Crystals and some Eternal Treasures, right?”

She nodded, “Yes!”

The old man flicked a spatial ring to her, “There are 100 Eternal Crystals in there. They are enough for you to advance to the True Void Realm. Besides that, there’s an Eternal Treasure in there too. With that in your possession, very few will be a match for you in the True Dao Realm.”

Bai Zhixian looked the old man in the eyes, “Why?”

The old man pointed at Yang Ye, “Give him to me, and it’s all yours.”

She was puzzled, “Just like that?”

The old man nodded, “Just like that! Leave him with me and you can have these. Moreover, I guarantee that you’ll leave this place safely. As for the reason, don’t ask. If you know what you shouldn’t know, it’ll be misfortune for you!”

Bai Zhixian glanced at the spatial ring and fell silent.

A long time passed before she lowered her head. At this moment, Yang Ye was still holding tight to her hand. She suddenly smiled at the sight of this, and then she looked up at the old man, “I’ll stay here with him!”

The old man asked, “Why?”

She chuckled, “No reason.”

The old man nodded slightly, “Alright!”

He put the spatial ring away, and then he placed his right hand on Yang Ye’s shoulder. A moment later, Yang Ye’s figure trembled.

Meanwhile, in the Sword Ruins, a white little fellow suddenly looked up. There was a trace of bewilderment in her eyes.

Suddenly, an ethereal face appeared above her.

It was the face of an old man.

Snowy’s eyes instantly opened wide at the sight of him, and then she placed her paw on the Sword Gourd by her waist.

When the ethereal face saw the speck of purple in Snowy’s eyes, it revealed a smile that contained deep meaning before gradually vanishing.

Snowy blinked while a baffled expression appeared on her face.

The Eternal Secret Realm.

The old man withdrew his hand, and a gentle smile appeared on his face, “As expected… Truly inconceivable. A world like that was actually able to give birth to a Sprite…”

Bai Zhixian gazed at the old man with a puzzled expression, “Senior?”

The old man didn’t answer her. He just gazed at Yang Ye for a long time before raising his palm, and there was a ball of energy there. Bai Zhixian noticed that the old man’s face was gradually aging, and a long time passed before a small ‘三’ character appeared above his palm.

The old man was stunned when he saw that, and there was a trace of disbelief in his eyes, “A 30% chance, 30%! How could it only be 30% when there’s a Sprite Progenitor by his side?” He gazed at Yang Ye once more, and it didn’t take long for him to frown, “The Slaughter Sword Dao! Ending slaughter with slaughter! The path of slaughter! No wonder!”

The old man fell silent at this point.

A long time passed before he looked up at the sky, “I don’t have much time left!”

He glanced at Wang Erya who was outside and his gaze gradually became firm. Meanwhile, Wang Erya gazed at him, and he smiled, “Go fill up the bath barrel. Remember to use all those herbs Grandpa used in the past.”

He flicked a white jade bottle over to her and continued, “Add this drop of blood in there too.”

Wang Erya blinked, “Grandpa, we don’t have much of this blood left.”

The old man smiled, “It’s fine. Let him use it. Just listen to your Grandpa. Go on.”

“Oh!” Wang Erya put her Tanghulu aside, took the jade bottle, and ran off into the bamboo house.

“Senior…” Bai Zhixian gazed at the old man with bewilderment.

The old man said, “Come with me!”

He turned around and walked into the house.

Bai Zhixian fell silent for a long time on the spot, and then she took Yang Ye with her and followed the old man.

Flee?

The old man’s strength was simply unfathomable to her, so it was utterly impossible. Especially when Yang Ye was heavily injured. Moreover, the old man displayed no hostility.

Bai Zhixian carried Yang Ye into the bamboo house. There was a bath barrel there, and blood red water resided within it. At this moment, the water within was bubbling.

The old man suddenly said, “Put him inside!”

Bai Zhixian was stunned, “Why?”

The old man explained, “It’s good for him.”

Wang Erya puckered her lips, “It absolutely hurts.”

The old man glared at her, “How else would you have gotten such strength?”

Wang Erya chuckled and continued licking her Tanghulu.

The old man gazed at Bai Zhixian, “I’m a descendant of the Divine Shaman Race during the Primal Era. You may not know much about my race. We were born to predict destiny. I’m helping him for a reason. It’s because he has great karmic luck, and I have something I need his help with in the future. So, you don’t have to worry at all. Moreover, allow me to be honest, both of you can't stop me if I wanted to kill him.”

Bai Zhixian laughed bitterly, “Senior, I’m afraid you’re unaware that he has many enemies in the outside world. So, I don’t really believe what you just said.”

The old man smiled, “They want to kill him because they can’t see through certain things, and I’m helping him because I was able to see through certain things. So, I chose to help him. If you have enemies, you’ll naturally have friends. I choose to be his friend.”

Bai Zhixian glanced at the old man. She didn’t say another word and just placed Yang Ye into the barrel.

As soon as he entered the bath barrel, Yang Ye’s body shook violently, and the blood red liquid within it gradually lessened. However, Yang Ye’s face had warped.

Pain!

Bai Zhixian gazed at the old man, and the latter grinned, “It’s fine, he’s absorbing the Divine Blood!”

Bai Zhixian was puzzled, “Divine Blood?”

The old man replied, “A Primordial God’s blood from the Primal Era. My Divine Shaman Race was fortunate enough to get a few drops all those years ago.”

“It’s very precious!” Meanwhile, Erya suddenly said, “Butcher has been begging Grandpa for a long time, but Grandpa never gave him a drop! Right, there are many herbs in there too, and all of them are precious as well. We’re only given one or two every year, but he’s using all of them now. Hmph!” Those herbs and blood had been for her, but Yang Ye was using them now. So, she was naturally quite unhappy. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

The old man rubbed her head, “You’ll get better things in the future!”

Sprite Energy!

Wang Erya wasn’t human, and she was at the limits of her body. Besides cultivating bitterly for thousands of years, the only way to advance further was help from Sprite Energy. That was the true reason that he was helping Yang Ye!

Wang Erya chuckled, “It’s fine. I’m already very powerful.”

The old man grinned, and then he gazed at the bath barrel. Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly opened his eyes, and a powerful wave of intent swept out from him.

At the same time, the old man stretched out his hand and pressed lightly.

It instantly forced the madness intent back into Yang Ye.

Bai Zhixian’s eyes were filled with solemness when she witnessed this!

The old man’s strength was much greater than she’d imagined!

Yang Ye was being forcefully suppressed in the barrel. Just like that, the blood red liquid gradually lessened, and Yang Ye’s body was soundlessly undergoing a change!

Time trickled by, and the blood red liquid was almost completely exhausted.

Yang Ye’s face was warped, and he seemed to be enduring tremendous pain.

The old man sized up Yang Ye’s body and said, “His foundation isn’t bad. Otherwise, I wouldn’t dare to let him use this divine blood.”

Bai Zhixian suddenly asked, “Will his body advance?”

The old man thought for a moment and replied, “I dare not say for sure. However, even if it doesn’t, ordinary True Dao Realm experts wouldn’t be able to harm him with ease.”

Bai Zhixian was shocked, “It’ll be that terrifying?”

The old man glanced at her, “You don’t know what a Primordial God is. If you did, you wouldn’t think it was terrifying. During the Primal Era, those known as gods were existences that even destiny dared not rashly offend!”

Bai Zhixian, “Destiny really exists?”

The old man smiled and remained silent.

Bai Zhixian wisely avoided asking more. She gazed at the bath barrel. At this moment, the blood red liquid within it had been fully devoured by Yang Ye.

Meanwhile, the old man spoke softly, “Looks like I underestimated his body a little.”

He hesitated for a moment and withdrew a white jade bottle, and then he poured the last drop of blood in it on Yang Ye’s head.

Bang!

The blood instantly entered Yang Ye’s head, and then it traveled along his blood vessels to his entire body.

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!

In an instant, Yang Ye’s body burst into flames!
