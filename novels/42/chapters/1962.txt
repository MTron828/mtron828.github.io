Chapter 1963 – The Dao Sect!

The 5th level!

The Primordial Pagoda had 9 levels, but he’d only accessed four of them until now. Even though he’d only accessed four of them, every single level had helped him tremendously.

He’d wanted to take a look at the 5th level for a long time. Unfortunately, he wasn’t the one who decided if he could have access, and it was the Primordial Pagoda instead.

Now, the Primordial Pagoda was finally allowing him to enter.

Yang Ye sat down cross-legged and immersed his consciousness into the pagoda. He didn’t alarm anyone and just went to the 5th level.

A door!

The first thing Yang Ye saw was a door.

Yang Ye didn’t hesitate to go over to it.

Suddenly, it opened slowly.

“Come in!” A voice came from within.

Yang Ye was stunned.

Two breaths of time later, Yang Ye walked in. There was only a single person in the room.

Yang Ye recognized the person. It was the old man in Daoist’s robes.

The old man sized up Yang Ye and smiled, “You’ve grown very quickly!”

Yang Ye looked the old man in the eyes, “Why?”

He wanted an answer.

Why the Primordial Pagoda chose him, why the old man chose him, the reason the old man chose him…

He had many questions that he wanted to be answered.

The old man shook his head slightly, “Do you believe in fate?”

Yang Ye replied, “Do you still believe in fate in your realm of cultivation?”

The old man grinned, “What do you think?”

Yang Ye replied, “I don’t know!”

The old man smiled, “Actually, this pagoda didn’t choose you in the beginning, it chose your father.”

Yang Ye frowned, “My father?”

The old man nodded slightly, “He possessed extraordinary natural talent and luck. However, he left this pagoda to you in the end.”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Why?”

The old man sized up Yang Ye and said, “You wouldn’t be you if he didn’t do that.”

Yang Ye’s frown deepened, “What do you mean?”

The old man shook his head slightly, “I don’t know much about it. In short, since this pagoda has chosen you, it proves there’s fate between us, and there’s fate between you and my Dao Path. Besides that, you’ll naturally be sucked into some things while you have this pagoda in your possession.”

He looked Yang Ye in the eyes and continued, “However, you have a choice. Two choices. The first, I’ll take this pagoda back and sever all ties with you. The second, join my Dao Sect and accept my inheritance!”

Yang Ye asked, “What will happen if I give up this pagoda?”

The old man smiled, “Nothing much. You’ll even be able to avoid a lot of trouble.”

Yang Ye asked, “Then what about if I join your Dao Sect?”

The old man answered, “Accept my inheritance and techniques, unlock the heart, and establish the Heaven Dao! However, it’s a very difficult path.”

Yang Ye asked, “Are you still not able to accomplish that? Even with your strength?”

The old man grinned, “When did the universe begin, when will it end?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “I don’t know!”

The old man smiled, “Neither do I!”

Yang Ye fell silent.

The old man continued, “People cultivate their strength and seek eternal life, but we cultivate the past, present, future, and the supreme Heaven Dao. In the end, we’re just slightly stronger than ordinary people. However, we’re just a speck in the boundless universe.”

He walked over to Yang Ye at this point, “The Dao is my foundation, my belief, and my path. I hope that even if I’m gone one day, my inheritance will be passed down. So long as my inheritance exists, I will remain eternal. However, the path towards the Grand Dao is filled with competition. Competition for resources, luck, destiny, and even inheritances.”

Yang Ye fell silent.

The old man said, “I didn’t choose anyone on purpose, and I didn’t make the Primordial Pagoda fall into your hands. I don’t have the energy and time to set up all of this either. It isn’t even necessary. Because if I made plans just for this, those other old fellows would laugh at me. Even though I didn’t make this pagoda fall into your possession on purpose, I have to admit that this pagoda and I have caused some karma to coil around you!”

He smiled and continued, “Accepting my inheritance naturally has to be done willingly. So, if you’re unwilling, I can sever the karma between us.”

What would Yang Ye choose?

He didn’t hesitate at all!

He looked the old man in the eyes and bowed respectfully like a disciple to his master, “Master!”

Sever the karma between them?

Yang Ye wasn’t an idiot. Was there any benefit from severing the karma between them? None! Not only were there no benefits, he would lose a lot too. Moreover, why would he give up such powerful backing?

The old man grinned, “I have many disciples, but only eight have personally received my inheritance. You’re the ninth, and the last one!”

Yang Ye asked, “Why?”

“It starts with one and ends with nine!” The old man continued, “Your Daoist name will be the Ninth Sword from now on!”

Ninth Sword!

Yang Ye had quite a strange expression on his face. I actually have a Daoist’s name… But Ninth Sword does sound quite nice!

Meanwhile, the old man flicked a ray of cold light into his forehead.

A moment later, numerous pieces of information flashed through Yang Ye’s mind.

A long time passed before Yang Ye opened his eyes slowly. Meanwhile, the old man said, “These are some of the sword techniques my Dao Sect gathered in the past. Some of them are techniques that some of my Dao Sect’s sword cultivators use. In short, all of them will be very helpful to you. However, you must remember that you should only read, observe, and learn from them. Do not cultivate them.”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Why?”

The old man smiled as he explained, “Everyone has their own Sword Dao, and so do you. Every single person’s Sword Dao only belongs to themselves, and it isn’t suited to be passed down to someone else. If someone tries to learn it by force, it will only make that person take the same path. So, you can read through them and learn from them, but you should take your own path. Understand?”

Yang Ye bowed respectfully, “I understand! But where can I find you?”

The old man shook his head slightly, “You’re too weak right now. It’ll be very disadvantageous to you if you come to the Dao Sect right now. Especially while this pagoda is in your possession. It's because your strength isn’t sufficient to convince everyone of your right to it. Besides that, if those other old fellows have their gazes on you, then you’ll be in even more trouble.”

He chuckled at this point and added, “You must understand that while I can point out a path for you and even open up a path for you, you have to walk through it yourself. Otherwise, it would be meaningless. Understand?”

He had to walk his own path!

Yang Ye nodded, “I understand!”

The old man said, “Every single race in the large universe has its own beliefs. The sky race once had its belief in my Dao Sect, but they became traitors. So, the Sovereign of Sky for that generation died.”

Yang Ye asked, “Master, what are you trying to tell me?”

The old man explained, “My Dao Sect doesn’t act like the Weapon Path and only spares those who obey it. But you must remember that anyone who wants to destroy my Dao Sect should be killed.”

Yang Ye fell silent for a moment and said, “I understand!”

The old man nodded slightly, “This space you’re in is called the Dead Dimension, but it didn’t go by this name in the past. It was a base of the Weapon Path. The remnants of the souls of some old fellows from the Weapon Path may still remain here. You don’t have to worry that they’ll take over your body because you have this pagoda, but you can’t be careless either.”

Yang Ye replied, “I’ll remember that!”

The old man nodded, and then his body gradually became ethereal. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Yang Ye hurriedly asked, “How do I leave this place?”

The old man replied, “If you can’t leave, then stay here forever. The Dao Sect and the fight between Paths is much more dangerous than this place!”

As soon as he finished speaking, his figure vanished!

Once the old man vanished, Yang Ye fell silent for a long time.

He’d figured out many things that were troubling him, but his heart felt slightly empty.

He couldn’t put a finger on it.

A long time passed before Yang Ye looked up and smiled. Why think so much about all of this? Who knows what’ll happen in the future? I should just focus on the path ahead.

Once he figured everything out, Yang Ye sat down cross-legged and recalled the sword techniques which the old man had given him.

As soon as he started looking through them, he was shocked!

Because there were over 10,000 of them, and there was a huge variety of them. Moreover, all of them were extremely powerful!

In an instant, Yang Ye was lost within these techniques!

These techniques were so strong that he blushed with embarrassment at his inferiority!

His Heavenrend and Split Second were nothing before them! They weren’t even trash before these techniques!

They were true techniques!

These techniques had opened up a new door for Yang Ye!

At this moment, he had the urge to cultivate all these techniques.

But he stopped himself in the end!

Just as the old man had said, they were the Sword Dao of others, and they weren’t his own. If he cultivated them, he would just be taking their paths and not his own path.

He had to take his own path!

Study, observe, learn, and create!

That was Yang Ye’s objective!

So, Yang Ye started studying sword techniques in the Primordial Pagoda every single day. As he read more and understood more, his mind was filled with more ideas.

So, he started to learn from them and create his own technique.

However, it was very difficult.

Creating something was no simple task!

While Yang Ye was bitterly cultivating in the Sword Dao, Sky Residence City found itself in trouble.

A’Man led a group up the city walls, and she slowly clenched her fists when she saw the scene outside the city walls.
