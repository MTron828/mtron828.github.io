Chapter 577 – The Sword Precursor and Defiant Profounders!

The ancient sheath’s sword? Yang Ye frowned and said, “Didn’t you say that I was too weak and unable to take control of it at all?” He’d been curious about that mysterious sword a very long time ago. Unfortunately, the Sword Spirit was extremely stubborn and utterly refused to reveal anything to him. She merely said that his strength was too weak, really too weak....

The Sword Spirit said, “You’re really too weak, but your physical strength is barely sufficient. If... if it were in the past, I would wait for you to attain the Monarch Realm before taking you to seek my main body. But I can’t wait any longer now.”

She can’t wait? Yang Ye’s face darkened as he said, “Hey, don’t get me killed. You said that even the Sword Sect’s Founding Ancestor wasn’t able to obtain it all those years ago, yet you want me to go get it now? Tell me the truth, are you trying to get me killed?” Even though he wanted that sword because she’d said that even the Mortal Emperor Sword couldn’t compare to it at all, he wanted to obtain it under the preconditions that he possessed absolute strength and confidence in being successful!

Aren’t I going to give my life away if I went for it now?

Yang Ye’s gaze grew even more hostile as he gazed at her.

“The heavens intend to destroy you!” said the Sword Spirit.

Yang Ye nodded and said, “I know. But what does that have to do with that sword?” F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“Don’t you want to slash the heavens apart?” The Sword Spirit’s voice was actually filled with temptation, “So long as you obtained my main body and executed Heavenrend, then you’ll definitely be able to destroy the quintessence of the heavens here. In that way, you would have destroyed the source of Luo Jun’s strength!”

Yang Ye grew even more vigilant. Is she trying to get me killed? But it doesn’t seem like that. If she wanted to kill me, she had many chances in the past like when I executed Heavenrend that day. I would have definitely died if she caused trouble for me then! But if she doesn’t want to get me killed, then why is she acting so impatient now?

“What exactly has happened?” Yang Ye spoke in a low voice.

She intended to say something but Yang Ye waved his hand and said, “I hope you tell me the truth. If you are facing some problem and I have the strength to help, then I’ll definitely help you. However, I’m going to flare-up if you are trying to deceive me and send me to my death.”

The Sword Spirit’s lips moved a little before she sighed softly in the end, “That Saint of the Flower Palace severely damaged the balance of this world when she descended here. The Will of the Heaven Dao here has been damaged by her arrival in this world, and many things might be emerging soon.”

“Be a little clearer!” Yang Ye frowned. His intuition told him that something bad was about to happen.

“My main body is called the Sword Precursor, and it was born from within the Primal Chaos. In other words, it was born before this world had been completely formed. I’m the first sword of this world, and I was forged from the Chaotic Yin and Yang energy of this world. Thus, I’m called the Sword Precursor. 100,000 years ago, a group of heaven defying Defiant Profounders appeared in this world. They’d arrived here from a different world, and their sole intent was to seize the Chaotic Energy and spirit energy of every single world, so this world was in unprecedented danger. Because once the Chaotic Energy and spirit energy in the world were to vanish completely, then the world would be destroyed in a very short period of time!” The Sword Spirit spoke softly, “My second master, some human profounders, the devil race, demon race, and many other races including some which hadn’t vanished at that time answered the summons of the Will of the Heaven Dao, and they joined forces against the defiant profounders. After a brutal battle that lasted for over 10,000 years, the defiant profounders had practically vanished from the continent.”

“Did they all die?” asked Yang Ye.

She shook her head and said, “They couldn’t be killed. Some of the peerless experts amongst them had cultivated their bodies and souls to an undying state. Not a single person in our world... no I should say that not even the Will of the Heaven Dao of our world was able to annihilate them. Perhaps the experts from the world that little girl comes from might be able to accomplish it.”

“Since they aren’t dead.... Are you telling me that they are still in our world?” Yang Ye gulped down a mouthful of saliva while a very bad feeling arose within him.

She nodded and said, “My second master joined forces with countless experts of this continent and the Will of the Heaven Dao to barely suppress them in the Daemon Catacombs, but their forces paid a heavy price to accomplish that. Countless experts perished, and my second master perished not too long after from the heavy injuries he’d suffered during the battles!”

“What does that have to do with you?” asked Yang Ye.

She gazed at him and said, “Even if countless experts joined forces at that time, and even the Will of the Heaven Dao assisted them, they were still unable to fully suppress those defiant profounders. So, my master stabbed my main body into the Daemon Catacombs and utilized me as a link to suppress those defiant profounders with the hell of the Will of the Heaven Dao and the Martial Will of countless experts. Now, the seal has loosened!”

Yang Ye’s eyelids twitched as he said, “Don’t tell me that the defiant profounders are about to burst out of the seal.”

She said, “I don’t know if they are, but I feel an unprecedented feeling of danger. So many years have passed, and this world is getting weaker while its experts are getting fewer. If there’s nobody to continue strengthening the seal, then it would be very normal for it to loosen.”

“How strong are they?” asked Yang Ye.

She replied, “The weakest amongst them are at the Half-Saint Realm!”

“How many are there?”

“Numerous....”

Yang Ye gasped, “How would we stop them if those fellows escape?”

The Sword Spirit answered, “Do you know why An Nanjing and Luo Jun have appeared in this era? Because the world has sensed danger as well, and it needs to reseal those defiant profounders. That’s why An Nanjing and Luo Jun have been born. The reason their genius is so monstrous is because they enjoy the Karmic Luck of this world. However, the heavens probably never imagined that you would appear in this world!”

“What does it have to do with me?” Yang Ye spoke with displeasure.

“Because your presence makes it very difficult for Luo Jun to unify the continent. That’s why the heavens intend to destroy you. Your very existence obstructs Luo Jun’s growth. If he can’t unify the continent and gather the experts of the entire continent, then the defiant profounders will definitely awaken once more. At that time, this world and everyone within it will die!” said the Sword Spirit.

Yang Ye spoke in a slightly displeased tone, “Hey, you make it seem like I’m a sinner of this entire world. You should get your facts straight. It’s they who want to kill me. Could it be that only they can kill me, yet I can’t resist?”

She fell silent for a short while before she said, “All of you should work together.”

Yang Ye laughed coldly and said, “Do you think that’s possible?”

“This world might really be destroyed if you continue obstructing Luo Jun!” said the Sword Spirit.

Yang Ye replied, “What does that have to do with me? It isn’t I who destroyed it in the end. All I know is that I’ll kill anyone who intends to kill me. If the heavens refuse to tolerate my existence, then even if the defiant profounders don’t destroy it, I’ll destroy it myself once I have sufficient strength!”

“You....” She was speechless.

Yang Ye glanced at her and said, “If I’m not wrong, you aren’t a Sword Spirit who regards all living beings in this world as part of your responsibility, right? After all, if you were, then you wouldn’t have chosen me but Luo Jun, right?”

The Sword Spirit fell silent for a moment before she said, “I’m suppressing those defiant profounders, but aren’t they restraining me at the same time? 100,000 years.... My main body has been trapped there for 100,000 years!” When she spoke up to this point, her voice carried monstrous resentment and rage.
