Chapter 989 – Reason Or The Fist?

One of the 5 Young Demon Kings? Yang Ye sized her up for a moment. He hadn’t expected her to actually be one of the 5 Young Demon Kings of the prefecture. However, it made sense because her physical strength was even greater than Seng Yuan, so it wasn’t really surprising.

“Are you Shangguan Yunhai or Qing Daofu?” She sized him up and said, “Wait. Shangguan Yunhai and Qing Daofu both don’t possess such powerful physical strength and defenses. Human! Who are you!?”

Yang Ye flipped his palm and withdrew the bear tooth, “I’m here to see your king!”

Her expression changed upon seeing the tooth, and she said, “You’re from Ocean of Clouds Academy!”

Yang Ye was quite surprised, “How did you know that?”

“You’re courting death!” She suddenly roared with fury, and then her figure shot forward and blasted her fist at Yang Ye’s head.

Yang Ye was stunned. He hadn’t expected her to actually attack him because it was quite surprising! Yang Ye didn’t have the time to think about it as her fist was already in front of him.

He flipped his palm, and the white shield appeared in his grasp before he raised it against her fist!

Bang!

An explosion resounded from the collision, and the ground around them instantly started to crack apart. Meanwhile, Yang Ye took around 20 steps back in succession while the woman took a few steps back as well.

Because the commotion from their battle was too loud, countless bears of a huge variety had come out of the city. However, they didn’t dare come close and stayed far away from the battlefield.

Bang!

Countless bears slapped their paws incessantly against the ground, and it was like they were cheering.

Meanwhile, Xiong Baitian who was lying on the ground in the distance said, “Big Brother, they are cheering for you!”

Cheering for me? Yang Ye was stunned. He glanced at the surroundings, and sure enough, he saw that those bears were looking at him. Moreover, they really seemed like they were cheering for him.

Meanwhile, the woman glanced at the bears in the surroundings, and all of them went silent in an instant. After that, they either raised their heads and looked up into the sky or looked down at the ground instead. They acted as if they didn’t know anything.

“I think that we can sit down and talk about it!” Yang Ye suddenly said, “There’s definitely some sort of misunderstanding between us. The fist isn’t always able to resolve a problem. Because it might make the incident grow even more complicated, and it might even cause some bad things to happen. So, why don’t...?”

The woman interrupted him in a cold tone, “Are all the men of Ocean of Clouds Academy so cowardly?”

Yang Ye’s face froze. Quite some time passed before he nodded, “The facts of the situation prove that I was wrong. Reason isn’t always able to resolve a problem. Because many people on this world don’t know what’s good for them. If you try to reason with them, they will think that you’re afraid of them, and they would try to take a yard instead! Since it’s like that, then let’s use violence instead!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye flipped his palm, and the Herculean Sword appeared in his grasp. He suddenly took a step forward with his right foot while he held the Herculean Sword in his right hand, and he transformed into a ray of light that shot forward. At the same time, his sword smashed forcefully towards the woman. Because Yang Ye was too quick and his strength was too powerful, the space before him was blasted apart, and it was an extremely shocking sight.

The woman’s expression changed slightly when she saw the Herculean Sword smashed down towards her. Obviously, she hadn’t expected Yang Ye’s strength to be so terrifying. She wasn’t able to dodge and could only face Yang Ye’s attack directly!

She smashed her fist forward!

An explosion resounded before the woman was blasted backwards. At the same time, Yang Ye suddenly appeared in front of her again, and his sword smashed down once more!

Bang!

She was blasted backwards again!

Just like that, Yang Ye’s speed was swift to its limits while enhanced by the Laws of Speed, and it caused her to have no chance to fight back and could only defend herself incessantly.

In less than a few breaths of time, she’d been pushed over 5km back, and her legs had dug out a very long trench below her.

The sight of this caused the spectating bears to be flabbergasted. Especially Xiong Baitian, his gaze towards Yang Ye was filled with excitement and admiration right now.

Even though Yang Ye had seized the upper hand and was firmly suppressing her in battle, Yang Ye’s expression grew even more solemn. Because he noticed that his violent attack hadn’t caused any material harm to her, and the reason she’d been suppressed was mainly because of his Laws of Speed!

Simply speaking, he hadn’t really gained an advantage over her at all!

Bang!

It didn’t take long for her to be pushed against the city wall. She suddenly stomped her right foot against the wall behind her, and her figure shot forward like a cannonball towards Yang Ye.

Right when she was about to ram against Yang Ye, Yang Ye suddenly vanished on the spot, and he was over 1km away when he appeared again.

She stopped herself and turned to look at Yang Ye with a slightly solemn gaze, “The Laws of Speed!”

Yang Ye said, “I didn’t come here to look for trouble. I’m only here to see the Bear King.”

“Is the Laws of Speed very great?” There was a slightly ferocious expression on the corners of her mouth as she swiftly slapped her hands forward!

Bang!

The entire ground trembled violently, and Yang Ye felt dizzy before pain came from his chest. His figure was blasted flying before smashing heavily against the city walls, and he even made it quake.

The countless bears in the surroundings shook their heads at the sight of this, and they seemed to be feeling pity.

“Besides Lou Qianxiao who isn’t bad, the rest of the human men of Pine Prefecture are trash. As for you, you can be considered as a comparatively outstanding piece of trash amongst them!” Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

The woman started walking slowly in Yang Ye’s direction, and countless strands of yellow energy suddenly appeared in the ground beneath her feet as she moved. The energy surged incessantly towards her, and her imposing aura grew stronger and stronger as a result of it, causing even those bears in the surroundings to move back repeatedly.

Cough!

Yang Ye stood up slowly while a thread of blood seeped out slowly from the corner of his mouth. He wiped it off before he looked up at her, and he said, “I really want to reason with you, but the facts of the situation prove that such thoughts are truly too foolish.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye stretched out his right hand and an intent sword condensed in his grasp.

“Quasi Void Rank sword intent!” The woman’s expression changed slightly when she witnessed this scene, and then her pupils constricted violently. Because countless rays of light had appeared in front of her.

Bang!

The woman smashed her fist forward, and the countless rays of light dispersed. Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly appeared behind her, and he pressed a dagger against her nape.

Her expression changed drastically at this moment, and she was about to counterattack. However, her figure suddenly stiffened on the spot because his dagger had stabbed into her nape and blood had instantly dyed her entire back red!

“You think you’re really strong?” Yang Ye spoke by her ear, “See? You’re actually really weak.”

As he spoke, Yang Ye suddenly rammed his knee against her back.

Bang!

Her figure was blasted flying. However, just a moment passed before Yang Ye appeared behind her again, and he raised his leg and kicked her back this time.

Pu!

A mouthful of blood sprayed from her mouth as her figure was blasted flying again. Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly grabbed her hair, and then slammed her against the ground on the left.

Bang!

A deep hole was smashed open there!

However, it wasn’t the end of it. Yang Ye held on to her hair and slammed her towards the right, then he slammed her forward, then backward....

In just a short moment, the ground around Yang Ye had completely collapsed, but Yang Ye hadn’t stopped. He moved away from that spot and started smashing her against the ground again.

The others here were stunned by the scene before them. Their eyes were open wide like the size of human fists as they watched Yang Ye, and they looked at him like they were looking at a monster.

Xiong Baitian was shocked to the point his eyeballs almost popped out of their sockets. However, when he noticed that Yang Ye showed no signs of stopping, he was astounded and hurriedly ran over to Yang Ye’s side, “Big... Big Brother. Stop... stop hitting her. I was just joking. Don’t hit my big sister.”

He’d only just arrived by Yang Ye’s side when Yang Ye suddenly turned around, and then Yang Ye smashed his fist against Xiong Baitian’s head.

A muffled bang resounded as Xiong Baitian howled with pain, and he transformed into a black shadow that shot backwards and crashed to the ground.

After he blasted Xiong Baitian away, Yang Ye continued smashing the woman against the ground, “I wanted to reason with you, but you wanted to use the fist instead. So, let’s use the fist to our heart’s content today!”

Bang!

The ground started to tremble incessantly!

“Quickly! Quickly stop him!” Meanwhile, Xiong Baitian’s weak voice suddenly resounded from afar.

The other bears in the surroundings finally recovered from their shock when they heard him, and they howled as they charged in Yang Ye’s direction.

Yang Ye suddenly stopped moving when he noticed the movement around him, and he raised his head to look at them. At this moment, his eyes were red.

“Fuck off!” Yang Ye suddenly howled with fury, and a ray of blood red light swept out while a dense aura of blood instantly suffused the surroundings.

Some of the bears that led the group were assaulted by the red light, and their eyes immediately turned crimson red before they started pouncing on their own companions. As for those who hadn’t gotten close enough, they were horrified and started retreating incessantly.

Xiong Baitian roared, “Big... Big Brother. Stop right now. Stop right now! She’ll die if you continue!”

The blood red hue in Yang Ye’s eyes cleared up quite a bit when he heard Xiong Baitian, and it didn’t take long for his eyes to become clear once more. As for the red light he emanated, they surged back into him like a receding tide.

The bears instantly returned to normal once the red light vanished. However, not a single one of them dared to charge forward now, and all of them revealed fear in their eyes.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly raised the woman by her hair and tossed her away!

Bang!

She slammed against the wall, and a huge explosion resounded before she crashed to the ground.

Pu!

A mouthful of blood sprayed from her mouth. Her figure twitched on the ground for a while before she gradually crawled back up to her feet.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye had suddenly appeared in front of her again, and the tip of a sword was pressed against the center of her forehead. The sword was stabbed 3cm into her skin, causing blood to seep out slowly and cover her face.

Yang Ye’s voice resounded by her ears, “Now, I’ll give you another chance. Do you want to reason with me or compete with our fists?”
