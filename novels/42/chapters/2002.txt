Chapter 2003 – Help!

Ferocity covered Yang Ye’s face.

Swish!

Yang Ye was about to attack when the sound of the air being torn open resounded from the other end of the spatial passageway, and it didn’t take long for a ray of light to appear within their fields of vision. It grew larger and larger, and it was shooting straight at the Blood Demon King!

The Blood Demon King immediately stopped and slammed his fist at the golden light.

Bang!

A loud explosion resounded, and then everyone watched with astonishment as the Blood Demon King was blasted over 3km away.

Everyone noticed that his fist was mangled.

A golden rod had appeared not too far away from the Blood Demon King.

Brother Monkey? Yang Ye frowned. A moment later, a flaming monkey appeared beside the golden rod.

The body of a man and the face of a monkey!

Yang Ye spoke with astonishment, “Brother Monkey, what’re you doing here?”

At this moment, Xiao Wuyi had stopped, and his expression was absolutely unsightly when he saw the monkey. Besides that, there was deep fear on his face. Obviously, he knew who the monkey was.

The monkey glanced at the surroundings, and his gaze stopped on a group not too far away from Xiao Wuyi. All of them were robust. Obviously, they were demon beasts in human form.

Those demon beasts were clearly filled with extreme fear when they saw the monkey, and they didn’t dare meet his gaze!

The monkey suddenly said, “Fuck off!”

Those demon beasts didn’t dare to say a word and just left.

Meanwhile, the monkey gazed at Yang Ye, “I’ve been looking for you!”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Looking for me?”

The monkey explained, “I need your help with something. Are you willing to go with me?”

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings and hurriedly nodded, “Of course!” Only a fool wouldn’t leave now!

The monkey nodded slightly, “Let’s go!”

Suddenly, Xiao Wuyi obstructed the monkey’s path. He glanced at the monkey and said, “The Sovereign of Man wants him. So…”

“The Sovereign of Man?” The monkey’s eyes narrowed slightly, “So what?”

Xiao Wuyi’s face fell, “You seem to have forgotten the agreement between the human race and demon race!”

The monkey asked, “Is this the human race’s territory?”

Xiao Wuyi was speechless. Because, strictly speaking, it couldn’t be considered as the human race’s territory.

Meanwhile, the monkey added, “Even if it’s the human race’s territory, I’ll take him if I want to. Understand?”

Xiao Wuyi’s face was extremely unsightly, but he didn’t dare to say anything. The human race wasn’t the only race that didn’t dare offend that monkey, all the other races didn’t dare to as well. After all, the monkey even dared to attack the Buddhist Path, let alone the human race?

The monkey ignored Xiao Wuyi and gazed at Yang Ye, “Let’s go!”

Yang Ye pointed at A’Man and the others, “I want them to leave with me. Please help me with that!”

The monkey glanced at them and said, “Go on!”

A’Man glanced at the monkey, “Thank you!” She gazed at Yang Ye and continued, “Take care!”

Yang Ye smiled, “All of you too.”

A'Man nodded, “Let’s get together again if we have the time!”

Yang Ye replied, “Alright!”

Yang Ye and the monkey watched as they swaggered off, and no one dared to stop them. Meanwhile, Xiao Wuyi’s face was extremely unsightly. Because it was a slap to his face, an undisguised slap to his face!

It was a resounding slap too!

In the end, once A’Man and the mothers all left, Yang Ye gazed at Xiao Wuyi and the Blood Demon King, “I’ll remember this, and I’ll get even with you soon!”

After that, he gazed at the monkey, “Let’s go!”

The monkey nodded slightly, waved his right hand, and vanished with Yang Ye.

The atmosphere here was quite solemn.

Both Xiao Wuyi and the Blood Demon King had quite unsightly expressions on their faces. They’d witnessed Yang Ye’s natural talent, and it was absolutely terrifying. So, if Yang Ye was allowed to continue growing, then he would absolutely be a huge threat to them!

That moment earlier had been the best time to kill Yang Ye, but they hadn’t expected the monkey to suddenly arrive! Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

So, it was undoubtedly like releasing a tiger back into the mountains!

Xiao Wuyi remained silent for a long time, and then he spoke softly, “Looks like we have to use non-ordinary methods!”

…

Once they left the Dead Dimension, the monkey took Yang Ye to the Demon Dimension.

On the way, Yang Ye was curious, “Brother Monkey, you’ve been searching for me?”

The monkey nodded, “I need your help with something!”

Yang Ye asked, ‘What?”

The monkey replied, “You’ll find out very soon!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he sped up again. Around two hours later, the monkey stopped.

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings. They were atop a mountain, and there was a huge waterfall not too far behind them. The waterfall stretched for over 1km.

The monkey suddenly looked up, “Do you know what’s above the sky?”

Yang Ye shook his head.

The monkey stated, “The gods above!”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “What do you mean?”

The monkey explained, “Some powerful people call themselves gods. They think they stand above all other races.”

Yang Ye had a rough understanding when he heard this. He knew that the monkey was probably talking about the Dao Path, Weapon Path, Buddhist Path, and Confucianist Path!

The monkey said, “A long time ago, after the god race vanished, these powers started to engage in internal strife, or it’s also called the battle between Paths. The battle between Paths wasn’t just an internal battle, it was an external one too. So, the other races had to take sides. The human race followed the Confucianist Path, the sky race followed the Dao Path, as for the demon race, we followed the Buddhist Path!”

“The demon race followed the Buddhist Path?” Yang Ye glanced at the monkey, “Brother Monkey, you don’t look like someone who believes in them!”

A wisp of disdain flashed through the monkey’s eyes, “All things have a spirit of their own, so why should they be superior to all others? Put our belief in them? No, I only believe in myself!”

Yang Ye said, “So the Buddhist Path acted against you, right?”

The monkey nodded, “As far as they are concerned, only those who believe in them should be allowed to stay alive.” He gazed at Yang Ye and continued, “I brought you here because I want you to help me with something.”

Yang Ye asked, “What?”

The monkey looked towards the ground below. There were a few hundred huge robust monkeys down there. At this moment, all of them were looking at the monkey by Yang Ye’s side.

The monkey said, “Help me take care of them for a year!”

Yang Ye was visibly astounded, “Huh?”

The monkey looked up at the sky, “For the sake of making me submit, they sent forces to launch a surprise attack on Spirit Monkey Mountain. While I annihilated all their forces, my Monkey Clan suffered severe losses. They are the last of my Spirit Monkey Clan.”

He glanced at the golden rod in his grasp and continued, “Now, I’ve recovered completely, and the Buddhist Path should pay for what they did. I’m going to the Western Buddhist Dimension, but I can’t rest at ease if I just leave them here!”

Yang Ye glanced at them, and then his face darkened, “Brother Monkey, some of your subordinates are much stronger than me!”

The monkey gazed at Yang Ye, “If you agree, all of them will obey you from now on until I return!”

Yang Ye said, “What I mean is that they’re stronger than me, so they don’t need me to take care of them!”

The monkey shook his head slightly, “They aren’t good at dealing with the schemes of others. If I leave, many Demon Kings will definitely target them. Some Demon Kings are dying to use the heads of my Spirit Monkey Clan to seek merit from the Buddhist Path!”

Yang Ye fell silent for a moment, and then he said, “Brother Monkey, you’re going to the Buddhist Path?”

The monkey nodded.

Yang Ye asked, “Are you confident?”

The monkey smiled, “I have to go even if I’m not. The lives of tens of thousand monkeys can’t go unavenged! Don’t worry, while the Buddhist Path is strong, I’ve attained the Indestructible Gold Body. Even the Buddhist Progenitor can’t kill me with ease.”

Yang Ye laughed bitterly, “Brother Monkey, I still think you’re being quite rash.”

The monkey gazed at Yang Ye, “We’re the same type of person!”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Huh?”

The monkey explained, “We can’t endure any injustice. Actually, why should we endure it? If others make us unhappy, why should we let them be happy?”

Yang Ye fell silent.

The monkey said, “Because I’m enemies with the Buddhist Path, while I used to have a few friends, we don’t keep in touch anymore. So, my Spirit Monkey Clan can be said to be isolated in the demon race.”

He gazed at Yang Ye and continued, “Kid, we haven’t known each other for long, but our characters are alike. To be honest, I didn’t bring you here for your strength, and it’s because of the Dao Progenitor who stands behind you. If I can’t return, then I hope they can follow you. Because following you is equivalent to siding with the Dao Path, and their survival shouldn’t be a problem if they have the Dao Path’s protection!”

I see! Yang Ye fell silent for a short while and said, “Brother Monkey, I’ll do it. I’ll help you take care of them. If you don’t return in a year, I’ll take them away from this place. Don’t worry, even if the Dao Path refuses to take them, I’ll take care of them!”

Just as the monkey had said, while they hadn’t known each other for long, but because of their character, they felt like friends who’d known each other for long. It could be said that they were friends even if there was such a huge gap in age between them. Besides that, the monkey had saved him from danger on many occasions, so he owed the monkey quite a bit!

Since the monkey needed help, he would naturally not refuse!

The monkey gazed at Yang Ye for a long time, and then patted him lightly on the shoulder, “You’re within a huge vortex, and its depth far surpasses your imagination. I can’t do anything to help too. In short, even if you go to the Dao Path, you must be careful. These powers treat people according to their potential. They’ll do everything for you if you have potential, but if you don’t have potential, they’re crueler and more realistic than any others!”

Yang Ye nodded, “I’ll remember that!”

The monkey grinned and looked up at the sky, “The Buddhist Path wants to kill me, so I’ll kill them first; if the gods want to kill me, I’ll kill the gods too!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he transformed into a ray of golden light that shot into the sky.
