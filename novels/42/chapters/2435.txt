Chapter 2436 – Demon Wings of Death!

Snowy scanned the surroundings but noticed nothing.

She’d been deceived!

She gazed at Yang Ye, glared at him, and then wrapped her paws around his head and kept rubbing her head against him!

Yang Ye patted her butt lightly and smiled, “It’s outside!”

Outside!

Snowy gazed at him, blinked, and then vanished on the spot.

Outside the Primordial Pagoda.

Snowy gazed at the casket with slight curiosity.

Yang Ye grinned and waited quietly.

Yang Ye knew his own ability well. If A’Leng and Huang Ying were helpless against the casket, then he would suffer the same fate. After all, their strength was on par.

Snowy!

The best way to deal with strange things like these was to ask Snowy for help!

Once Snowy appeared here, Huang Ying and A’Leng’s gazes descended onto her.

They were curious!

A’Leng and Huang Ying were filled with curiosity about the future Sprite Progenitor. Since Yang Ye had summoned the little fellow, it was obvious he wanted to get the little fellow to subdue the casket.

Meanwhile, Snowy leaped over to the casket, and the latter immediately trembled in response.

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly while the sword in his sheath was ready to be drawn at a moment’s notice!

Snowy suddenly slapped the casket.

Bam!

A light impact resounded, and then the casket calmed down. But just a moment later, a wave of powerful energy rippled out of it.

Snowy’s eyes opened wide, and she’d forgotten to flee. Suddenly, Yang Ye appeared above the casket. He grabbed Snowy and stabbed his sword at the casket.

Bang!

Yang Ye and Snowy were blasted over 3km away!

The ground cracked open like a spiderweb when Yang Ye’s feet descended to the ground!

His right hand was trembling!

However, there was a very obvious hole in the casket!

Executor!

The number one sword of Eternal Kingdom definitely deserved its reputation!

Yang Ye stared at the casket.

What the heck is that? It even refuses to give Snowy face?

Meanwhile, the casket had returned to calm once more!

However, Snowy was furious. She was about to fly over but Yang Ye stopped her. She gazed at Yang Ye and waved her paws swiftly to say that he should leave it to her!

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and asked, “Are you sure?”

Snowy hurriedly nodded.

Yang Ye was a little doubtful, but Snowy pointed at the casket and started waving her paws swiftly again.

She was very confident!

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and nodded, “Be careful!”

Snowy immediately turned around upon receiving Yang Ye’s permission, and then she inhaled in the casket’s direction.

Hiss!

In an instant, something seemed to be sucked out of the casket.

Spirit!

It was one of Snowy’s special abilities—the ability to absorb the spirit of things.

Suddenly, the casket transformed into a ray of black light that shot at Snowy, but Snowy didn’t fear it at all because Erya had appeared before her. There was a tombstone on Erya’s shoulder!

Erya grabbed it with both hands and slammed it down.

Bang!

The casket was stopped on the spot.

However, Erya’s countenance turned ghastly cold. Meanwhile, Yang Ye, who was about to attack, suddenly stopped because Snowy had acted before him. Snowy leaped up and arrived on the casket’s lid, and then she slapped it with her paw. At the same time, she inhaled again.

Bang!

The casket shook violently while countless strands of spirit energy escaped from it.

“AH!” Suddenly, Erya howled with fury and stomped her right foot down.

Bang!

The ground in the surroundings collapsed, and the casket was slammed over 3km away!

Yang Ye and the others were extremely shocked by this. Erya’s strength was too terrifying! Even Yang Ye who possessed extremely powerful physical strength paled in comparison!

The casket didn’t dare to attack rashly again upon suffering the joint forces of Erya and Snowy. It stopped 3km away and seemed to be afraid of them.

Erya glanced at the casket and said, “Snowy, it even refuses to give you face. Looks like it isn’t ordinary!”

She grabbed the tombstone with both hands and slammed it at the casket.

Hiss!

Everywhere the tombstone passed, space was obliterated!

The casket wouldn’t just take this lying down, so it immediately slammed itself against the tombstone.

Bang!

Erya’s tombstone was blasted away.

Erya raised her right hand and pressed it against the tombstone, and just that was able to stop the terrifying energy contained within the tombstone and force it to a stop. However, Erya was pushed around ten steps back too!

Erya moved her hand away, and the tombstone crashed to the ground, causing the ground to quake beneath it while dust shot up into the air!

Erya patted her palms together and slowly curled them into claws! She was about to attack when Snowy suddenly patted her on the shoulder. She gazed at Snowy, and the latter pointed at herself! Snowy was telling Erya that she would deal with the casket!

Erya took out a tanghulu and started licking it while she said, “Snowy, you may not be a match for that fellow.”

Snowy blinked and gazed at the casket, and then she glanced at her own paws. She really wasn’t very good at fighting! However, did she need to fight?

Snowy gazed at Erya and stretched out her tongue. Erya immediately passed the tanghulu to Snowy. The latter licked it, and then she gazed at the casket.

Snowy flew over to the casket, but this time, the casket didn’t attack again. Even the casket was very afraid of this little fellow which could suck away its intelligence. It could be said that Snowy was the existence here that it feared the most!

Snowy didn’t try to suck away its spirit again, and she blew at it instead. In an instant, countless strands of spirit energy converged toward it.

Spirit energy!

Snowy’s exclusive spirit energy! Spirit energy that could improve the spirit!L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Once the spirit energy surged into the casket, it started to tremble!

Sprite Ascension!

It was something that every natural treasure and being yearned for. Especially Divine Treasures of very high level like it. Because the greater they were, the more difficult it was for them to improve further. Take Divine Treasures for example. If they were made to cultivate on their own, it was practically impossible for them to become Super Divine Treasures without an extraordinarily great fortuitous encounter. But Snowy was a fortuitous encounter to them all, a huge one too!

That was why the Sprite Progenitor was loved and protected by all!

It was because she could perform Sprite Ascension!

The casket was quite stunned by this. What is this little fellow trying to do?

A short while later, Snowy stopped abruptly. She glanced at the casket, blinked, and moved aside.

The casket was stunned. It suddenly floated over to Snowy and trembled before it. It seemed to be conveying something.

Snowy glanced at it and waved her paw to display that she wasn’t continuing.

The casket moved closer to Snowy, but Snowy ignored it.

Snowy just ignored everything it did.

Everyone in the surroundings was flabbergasted by this. It was obvious that the casket was begging Snowy, but Snowy was being very proud and wouldn’t even spare it a glance.

Erya licked her tanghulu and said, “Snowy has become so sly!”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

Just like that, a long time passed before the casket trembled abruptly. Right when Yang Ye and the others thought it was about to attack, its lid suddenly moved and slowly slid off.

The casket’s lid had been removed!

Yang Ye and the others watched as a pair of wings floated out slowly from within the casket. It was completely pitch black and like the spread wings of a roc. Countless strands of black light and Yin gales flowed around it. The most dazzling part of the wings was its back, it seemed like it had been made with human bones.

An evil aura!

A’Leng’s pupils constricted when she saw the pair of wings, “The Demon Wings of Death!”

Huang Ying’s eyes were filled with disbelief as well! Obviously, he’d recognized the wings too!

Yang Ye gazed at them, and they exchanged glances before Huang Ying spoke solemnly, “It was once a Super Divine Treasure!”

A Super Divine Treasure!

Yang Ye was stunned. He gazed at the winds and thought to himself.

No wonder it refused to give Snowy face! It has quite the special identity!

Meanwhile, Huang Ying continued, “Unfortunately, it’s probably not a Super Divine Treasure anymore.”

Yang Ye asked, “Why?”

Huang Ying explained solemnly, “It was very famous during its time. It was a treasure of the Hell Sect’s ancestor that was formed from countless evil spirits and Yin Energy. According to my knowledge, the Hell Sect’s ancestor spent tens of thousands of years to form it. Throughout these years, he gathered countless evil spirits, Death Energy, and Yin Energy. It could be said that he exhausted a very, very huge amount of effort to create those wings.”

Huang Ying paused at this moment and continued, “When it was formed all those years ago, it spent another tens of thousands of years cultivating, and it found its own Dao and advanced into a Super Divine Treasure. The universe was shocked when that happened! However, its destiny wasn’t a good one. But for some unknown reason, not long after it became a Super Divine Treasure, it was forcefully damaged to the point of dropping back down, and even its intelligence was dispersed! If I’m not wrong, the Hell Sect’s master created this cemetery for it. Only among this endless Yin Energy and Death Energy is it able to have a chance at recovering and becoming a Super Divine Treasure again.”

A'Leng spoke softly, “That casket was probably made by the Hell Sect’s ancestor to protect it. If it hadn’t come outside on its own accord, our strengths would probably be insufficient to break it open and see these wings!”

Meanwhile, Erya’s voice resounded, “Big Brother Yang, look at Snowy!”

Yang Ye and the others looked up, and they were stunned by the scene before them. Snowy was seated on the wings, and she was ceaselessly knocking it with her little paw.

But not only did the wings refrain from resisting, it even condensed countless strands of Death Energy and Yin Energy to protect Snowy.

All of them were stunned speechless by this.
