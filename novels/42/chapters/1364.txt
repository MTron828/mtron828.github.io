Chapter 1365 – Come!

Yang Ye’s eyes instantly narrowed slightly when he heard the old man.

The Alliance of Guardians!

They were his enemy!

That power had forced him out of the Radiant Dimension. Now, it had joined forces with the Celestial Demon Stellar Region to attack Lady and cause her to fall into a hopeless situation. So, they were naturally his enemy. However, he didn’t act rashly. He wasn’t all alone anymore, and he had a huge group of people behind him. Thus, a moment of rashness might create a huge amount of trouble for him. He didn’t want to waste his time here!

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts and gazed at Tingyu, “Miss Tingyu, you said that something they lost is with me? Why don’t I understand what you mean?”

Tingyu looked at Yang Ye, but there was no smile on her face now. She just looked at him for a while and said, “Alliance Master Yang, I feel that interrupting others is a very rude thing. Don’t you think so too?”

Yang Ye was about to speak when Ting Yu added, “Besides that, I really hate it when others interrupted me. So don’t do it again, alright?”

Yang Ye glanced at her and smiled, “It was my mistake to interrupt you earlier. I apologize!” ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Tingyu’s face was calm, but a trace of contempt flashed through her eyes. She spoke indifferently, “I’ll be frank. These 3 friends of mine won the bid for an item in our auction house. But it was stolen once they left the auction house. According to the information I obtained, the person who stole that item entered Divine Sky Pavilion with you, Young Master Yang.”

A smile curled up on the corners of her mouth at this point, and then she continued, “Young Master Yang, I know that you were unaware that he’d stolen from these friends of mine. So, you just have to hand him over to these friends of mine. Of course, if the item has accidentally fallen into yours hands, then please return it to its rightful owner. After all, it’s better to have another friend than another enemy, right?”

“That’s very true!” Yang Ye nodded with agreement.

The smile on Tingyu’s face grew wider when she saw Yang Ye react like that, and she felt that he was very sensible.

Suddenly, Yang Ye said, “But Miss Tingyu, have you made a mistake? I’ve been constantly cultivating in my room, and I haven’t left at all. I really don’t know this person you’re speaking of.”

What a joke! How could he possibly give away something he’d already pocketed? Moreover, it was something that belonged to the Alliance of Guardians, so he absolutely couldn’t hand it over. Because it was very likely that it had been purchased to attack Lady! If he’d found out that the Alliance of Guardians was here to buy such a thing, then he would have acted even if Yan San hadn’t stolen it!

The smile on Tingyu’s face stiffened when she heard Yang Ye, and it didn’t take long for her smile to become quite cold. As for the old men by her side, their faces were gloomy while undisguised killing intent appeared in their eyes!

Tingyu lightly rubbed the spatial ring on her left hand and spoke in a carefree manner, “Young Master Yang, Dark Hell Continent was once a medium world, but it was sealed for over 10,000 years, so it’s impossible for even a single Semi-Deity to exist there. As for Skyriver Stellar Region, while it doesn’t have many Semi-Deities, it still has a few. So, Young Master Yang, are you sure that you haven’t seen him?”

It was a threat!

Ye Liuyun’s face fell when she heard Tingyu. Her finger moved slightly as she was about to contact Fen Cangyan and the others who were cultivating in their rooms, but Yang Ye stopped her.

Yang Ye gazed at Tingyu and smiled, “Miss Tingyu, I don’t like hearing things like that.”

“Is that so?” She spoke indifferently, “It’s invaluable advice to you, Young Master Yang, but I understand. After all, honest advice is hard to take, right?”

Yang Ye nodded and said, “You’re right. So allow me to give you some invaluable advice as well. It’s best to mind your own business. Don’t you think so too?”

Tingyu’s eyes instantly narrowed when she heard him.

Meanwhile, the old man in luxurious robes suddenly said, “Miss Tingyu, you’ve helped us find who we’re looking for, so we’ll resolve it ourselves. We won’t trouble you further.”

Tingyu shook her head and said, “Elder Gu, I, Yue Tingyu, am going to see this to the end.”

As she spoke, she gazed at Yang Ye and said, “Young Master Yang, even though I, Yue Tingyu, am a tiny manager in Stellar City’s Azure Cloud Merchant Group, but everyone in Stellar City still gives me face. Young Master Yang, let me give you one last piece of advice. A person should have a little ability to discern who they can offend, and who they shouldn’t offend. You must open your eyes wide and see it clearly. Otherwise, you might just vanish from this world.”

“Miss Tingyu!” Meanwhile, Ye Liuyun suddenly spoke, “Since you were able to rise into the ranks to become a manager, it proves that you have some ability. Right, your ability to discern things should be pretty good too. However, allow me to give you some advice. When you look at people, you absolutely shouldn’t look down on others. Allow me to be frank, you’re doing that right now.”

Yue Tingyu turned to look at Ye Liuyun, and she gazed at Ye Liuyun for a few breaths of time before she suddenly cracked a smile, “What a sharp tongue. Let’s make a bet. I bet that what you just said are the last words you speak in your life, alright?”

Ye Liuyun gazed at Yue Tingyu for a long time and said, “I’ll take that bet.”

“Alright!” As soon as she finished speaking, Yue Tingyu’s expression instantly became cold, and then she stretched out her hand and grabbed at Ye Liuyun. At the same time, a terrifying aura enveloped down towards Yang Ye and Ye Liuyun.

It was the aura of a Voider!

The old men behind her were shocked when they sensed the aura she emanated. She was actually a Voider! After all, she was just around the age of 30!

She’d attained the Voider Realm at such a young age!

Such natural talent was shocking!

Ye Liuyun’s expression didn’t change when she saw Yue Tingyu attack abruptly. It didn’t take long for Yue Tingyu’s hand to arrive just half an inch away from Ye Liuyun’s throat, but her hand suddenly stopped.

The expressions of the 3 old men changed drastically!

Because a hand had clamped down on Yue Tingyu’s throat.

It was naturally Yang Ye’s hand.

Yue Tingyu stared fixedly at Yang Ye while absolute shock filled her heart. Because she’d actually been restrained by an Emperor! Even though she hadn’t been on guard, she was a Voider while Yang Ye was just an Emperor!

Yang Ye held onto Yue Tingyu’s throat and raised her up towards him, and he looked at her from a short distance and said, “Miss Tingyu, let me make a bet with you as well. I bet that those words you just spoke will be the last words you speak in your life, alright?”

Yue Tingyu stared fixedly at Yang Ye for a short while and said, “I really have failed to see this time.”

Yang Ye smiled, but his smile was quite ferocious. Suddenly, Ye Liuyun pulled on his sleeve. Yang Ye turned to glance at her, and he saw her shake her head slightly. A moment of silence ensued, Yang Ye shrugged and released Yue Tingyu before he smiled, “Miss Yue, I’ve really not seen that person you spoke of. So, please leave!”

Ye Liuyun glanced at Yang Ye when she heard this, and a faint smile curled up on the corners of her mouth. It wasn’t because Yang Ye had released Yue Tingyu, it was because Yang Ye was willing to change his decision for her. That proved that she had a certain status in Yang Ye’s heart.

Yue Tingyu carefully sized up Yang Ye and said, “Young Master Yang, your strength is truly great. No wonder you were able to unite Dark Hell Continent.”

Yang Ye spoke indifferently, “It’s just ordinary!”

Yue Tingyu was about to speak when Ye Liuyun spoke instead, “Miss Tingyu, as a manager, no matter how angry you are, you should maintain a certain level of composure and clarity. Only then can people like us make decisions that are most beneficial to us. Otherwise, a rash decision would cause us to suffer punishment!”

Ye Liuyun was very well aware that Yue Tingyu definitely thought Yang Ye didn’t dare to offend Azure Cloud Merchant Group, and that was why Yang Ye had let her go. But the truth was Yang Ye didn’t know how strong Azure Cloud Merchant Group was.... Of course, even if he knew, based on how insane Yang Ye was, he wouldn’t care at all if he was infuriated!

Yue Tingyu glanced indifferently at Ye Liuyun, and then she just disregarded Ye Liuyun. In the end, her gaze descended upon Yang Ye, “Young Master Yang, I’m in quite an embarrassing situation right now, so can you give me some face and hand that person over?”

Ye Liuyun shook her head when she heard Yue Tingyu, and then she took a step back.

As soon as Yue Tingyu finished speaking, Yang Ye gazed at her and said, “I don’t want to give you face.”

Yue Tingyu gazed at Yang Ye for a long time, and then she nodded and moved around 10m back. Meanwhile, 3 auras suddenly appeared in the distance and were approaching them. It didn’t take long for 3 black robed old men to appear by Yue Tingyu’s side.

Voiders!

3 Voiders!

Moreover, one of them was a true Voider!

The old man with a walking stick asked, “Tingyu, what’s wrong?” The old man with a walking stick was the true Voider in the group.

Yue Tingyu replied, “Elder Xun, as a manager of the merchant group in Stellar City, I have the right to ask for a personal matter to be resolved on my behalf every month, right?”

The old man nodded, “Indeed. However, I advise you not to use that authority you have. Because you’ll be in huge trouble if any problems arise.”

She spoke coldly, “I’m truly unable to swallow this humiliation!”

The old man glanced at Yue Tingyu’s icy cold face, and then he nodded and didn’t speak another word.

Meanwhile, Yue Tingyu looked up at Yang Ye and smiled, “Young Master Yang, since you refuse to hand him over, then I can only head in and look for myself.”

As soon as she finished speaking, she waved her right hand.

The old man with the walking stick nodded. As soon as they received the old man’s orders, one of the old men amongst the 2 remaining old men immediately shot towards Divine Sky Pavilion.

Om!

Suddenly, a sword howl resounded. As soon as it did, a ray of sword energy flashed!

At the instant that the sword energy appeared, the expressions of the old man with the walking stick and the old man in a luxurious robe had changed drastically!

They were about to act, but that old man who’d charged towards Divine Sky Pavilion had suddenly stopped on the spot.

Hiss!

A breath of time later, the old man’s body was split apart at the center, and his internal organs scattered all over the ground. It was an absolutely bloody scene!

A Voider had been killed with a single swing of the sword!

Everyone here was stunned.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye walked towards Yue Tingyu and said, “Come! Head in if you dare!”
