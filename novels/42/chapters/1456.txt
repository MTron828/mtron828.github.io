Chapter 1457 – Deities Everywhere!

Needless to say, this place was growing more and more mysterious!

At this place, Yang Ye had finally understood what it meant when people said that the world was huge and filled with all sorts of things!

Who was inside the casket?

Yang Ye was really curious, but he’d decided not to go look.

Curiosity killed the cat.

It was best to restrain his curiosity in this place.

Yang Ye started walking towards the other side and stayed far away from the ice casket. Even an idiot would realize that it was definitely not normal for a casket to be here. It was better to just avoid trouble and leave as quickly as possible!

It didn’t take long for Yang Ye to be on the verge of going fully around the casket.

However, right when he was about to get to the other side....

Bang!

A white shadow suddenly charged out from an area in the ice that wasn’t far away from Yang Ye, and then it shot towards him.

Yang Ye’s expression changed slightly. It was extremely swift to the point that he couldn’t dodge it at all, and he could only go head-on against it.

Yang Ye grabbed his sword’s hilt, drew it, and swung it!

Bang!

An explosion resounded, and then both Yang Ye and the white shadow were blasted backwards. Yang Ye moved around 3km back before he finally stopped, but the white shadow had merely moved 300m back!

The gap in their strength was obvious!

At this moment, Yang Ye saw the white shadow’s figure clearly. It was a huge white bear. However, unlike ordinary bears, it had a pair of pure white wings. Besides that, its tail was quite unique. The fur on it was like sharp spikes of ice, and it was quite terrifying.

The white bear had a ferocious expression on his face while a fierce gaze filled its eyes. The wings behind it were flapping lightly, and it seemed to be ready to attack at any moment.

Yang Ye glanced at it and said, “I’m just passing by. Let me through, alright?”

Roar!

It roared with fury, and then it pounced at Yang Ye.

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly, and then he waved his right hand. Big Blackie, Little Blackie, and Eaglet shot forward. Eaglet was the quickest, and it instantly slammed its claw at the white bear while the two Celestial Demon Wolves were close behind Eaglet.

Bang!

The white bear was blasted far away under their joint forces. Moreover, even after it descended to the ground, its body still scraped against the ground as it moved around one more kilometer back!

The white bear grew even more furious when it saw Big Blackie and the others. It raised its head and roared with fury, and it was so loud that it sounded like a thunderclap that was sweeping swiftly towards the surroundings.

Yang Ye was stunned for a moment, but it didn’t take long for his expression to change. The white bear was calling for reinforcements!

Yang Ye was about to say something when....

Rumble! Rumble! Rumble!

Rumbling resounded from all around Yang Ye, and then the ground cracked apart incessantly before numerous white shadows flashed out from the ground. In just an instant, over 200 white bears had appeared around him.

Yang Ye’s face instantly became unsightly.

Roar!

The white bear in the distance roared with fury, and then all the other white bears charged at Yang Ye’s group.

What should I do? Yang Ye’s mind was working swiftly, and it didn’t take long for him to gaze at the ice platform in the distance. He didn’t hesitate to flash onto Big Blackie’s back, and then he said, “Head over to the ice platform.”

Big Blackie immediately charged towards the platform.

The reason he’d chosen the ice platform was that he’d noticed all the white bears didn’t dare to get close to it. They stayed very far away from it and seemed to be afraid of something. So, Yang Ye had decisively chosen to head over there. Because based on the forces he possessed, it was definitely impossible for them to be a match for so many winged white bears.

The white bears seemed to have been aggravated when they saw Yang Ye’s group charge towards the ice platform. All of them howled madly and charged madly at Yang Ye’s group.

A few dozen white bears entered into a fan-shaped formation to obstruct Yang Ye’s group’s path. Obviously, they wanted to stop Yang Ye from approaching the ice platform.

A wisp of ferocity flashed through Yang Ye’s eyes. He shot up into the sky, grabbed the hilt of his sword with his right hand, drew it, and swung it down.

Om!

A sword howl resounded, and the force of the sword howl caused the ground to crack apart. At the same time, some of the white bears that led the charge were instantly stopped dead in their tracks.

Two overlapped Heavenrends that were enhanced by both of Yang Ye’s intents!

At this moment, Yang Ye hadn’t held back at all, and he’d immediately overlapped two Heavenrends!

Because he was very well aware that a single Heavenrend wouldn’t be a threat to those bears. But once they were encircled, they would definitely die.

So, he couldn’t hold back at all!

A beam of sword energy shot through the air.

Bang!

The white bears at the front of the group were instantly obliterated. As for the rest of the white bears, they were blasted backwards and towards both sides.

A path appeared before Yang Ye’s group. Big Blackie grabbed the opportunity to leap up onto the ice platform.

Once they arrived on the ice platform, the white bears that were charging at Yang Ye’s group had instantly stopped moving. After that, they started howling hysterically at Yang Ye’s group. All of their eyes seemed to be on the verge of cracking open from rage, and they seemed like they wished to eat Yang Ye’s group’s flesh. However, they didn’t dare to move forward!

Yang Ye heaved a sigh of relief because he’d made the right bet.

If he’d made the wrong bet, then they would be finished. Because there were so many white bears here, even Qiong Qi wouldn’t be able to suppress them. After all, there were so many. There were over 200 here.

Deities really were everywhere in this place! Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

It wasn’t just Yang Ye who’d heaved a sigh of relief, Big Blackie and the others had done the same. They wouldn’t fear the white bears in single combat, but the white bears had the numbers!

Fortunately, the white bears didn’t dare to approach the ice platform!

Even though they didn’t dare to approach the ice platform, Yang Ye’s group didn’t dare to get off the ice platform as well!

It was a stalemate!

Yang Ye glanced at the white bears in the surroundings, and then he sat down cross-legged before withdrawing some divine crystals and absorbing the energy within them. He’d executed an overlapped Heavenrend just now, and it had exhausted his profound energy. Moreover, his body felt slightly exhausted. So, he had to recover his profound energy and recuperate to his peak!

Eaglet and the two demon wolves stood on guard by Yang Ye’s side, and they remained vigilant at all times.

Meanwhile, the white bears were still roaring in the distance. All of them were rubbing their claws together with the desire to charge forward and tear Yang Ye’s group into bits. However, they seemed to be afraid of something, and they always retreated immediately after taking a few steps forward.

Even then, Eaglet and the others didn’t dare act carelessly and were vigilant at all times.

Around an hour later, Yang Ye opened his eyes.

His profound energy had been completely recovered, and his body had been completely repaired by the Primordial Violet Energy within him.

Yang Ye stood up and glanced at the white beers. All of them seemed like their eyes were about to split apart from rage, and practically all of their gazes were on him. If their gazes could kill, then Yang Ye would have lost his life a very long time ago.

Yang Ye withdrew his gaze, and then he turned around and gazed at the ice casket which was floating not too far above him. Obviously, the white bears didn’t dare to approach the ice platform because of that casket.

What was within the casket?

What was it that filled such powerful demon beasts with fear?

Yang Ye remained silent for an instant, and then he turned to look at the white bears, “Which one of you is the leader?”

Roar!

A huge white bear arrived not too far away from the ice platform. It was much larger than the other bears, and its fur wasn’t pure white. It was white with some violet. Moreover, its aura was much stronger than the other bears. Obviously, it was the leader.

Yang Ye said, “I’m not here to look for trouble with all of you, and I just want to pass through. Let me pass, and we can get along peacefully. Alright?”

He wasn’t here to look for trouble, and his objective was the Forest of Darkness. So, he’d decided to negotiate.

The white bear glared angrily at Yang Ye while the intent to kill filled its eyes. It didn’t say anything and just gazed at Yang Ye.

The intent to kill?

Not to mention the intent to kill from a single white bear, even the intent to kill from 10,000 white bears would be useless against Yang Ye. His slaughter intent was at the Quasi Returnal Rank, so the intent to kill and any other related aura was completely useless against him.

Yang Ye remained silent for an instant, and then he added, “Is it that difficult to just let us pass? I’m not even asking you to let me skin you!”

Actually, Yang Ye was quite infuriated right now. He’d noticed that the demon beasts within the Ominous Territory were extremely arrogant. So long as someone entered their territory, then it was like someone was trying to take their lives, and they would fight desperately with their lives on the line.

Wasn’t it better to just be a little flexible?

Roar!

The white bear didn’t answer Yang Ye. The white bear just roared at Yang Ye, and it seemed like the white bear was asking Yang Ye to get down from there.

Get off the platform?

Yang Ye would naturally not do that. If he did, then he would be besieged by the white bears! Only a fool would do that!

Yang Ye gazed at Eagled and said, “Tell him to let us pass, and all of us can get along peacefully. Otherwise.... Otherwise....”

Yang Ye was quite embarrassed at this point. Because even if the white bear refused, it didn’t seem to have any way to deal with the white bear.

Yang Ye paused for a moment and said, “In any case, tell him that if he doesn’t let us pass through, then I’m going to act rashly.”

Eaglet glanced at Yang Ye, and it didn’t feel like Yang Ye was joking. It knew a little about Yang Ye’s temper, and it knew that Yang Ye’s temper was definitely explosive. If Yang Ye said he would act rashly, then Yang Ye would definitely do it. Eaglet just didn’t know how Yang Ye would do it. After all, they were in a disadvantaged situation.

Eaglet turned to look at the leader of the white bears, and then it passed on Yang Ye’s message.

Bang!

Meanwhile, the leader of the white bears slammed its claws against the ground, and then it roared at Yang Ye.

Its eyes were completely red, and it was on the verge of going berserk.

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly, So that fellow refuses to be reasoned with!

Yang Ye paid no further attention to the white bear, and he just turned to look at the ice casket. He gazed at it for a long time, and then he turned to look at the white bear before he said, “You want to force me to act rashly, huh? Then just watch me do it!”

As soon as Yang Ye finished speaking, his figure flashed onto the ice casket, and he placed his right hand on its lid. He gazed at the leader of the white bears and said, “I’ll ask you one last time. Will you let us pass or not? If you refuse, then I’m going to open this!”

Roar! Roar! Roar!

The white bears started roaring madly.

“Will you let us pass or not?!” Yang Ye’s eyes were filled with madness, and he was exerting a little strength.

The bears were still roaring.

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly. He was about to open the casket when the leader of the white bears roared abruptly. Its roar shocked all the roaring white bears, and then they moved aside and opened up a path.

Yang Ye heaved a sigh of relief when he witnessed this scene.

He moved his hand away.

However....

Crack!

Yang Ye and the white bears were stunned. They seemed to have thought of something, and then their gazes simultaneously shot over to the ice casket.

The lid of the ice casket slowly floated up into the air while they watched.

“I’m in trouble now!” Yang Ye’s heart shook at the sight of this, and his face became quite unsightly.
