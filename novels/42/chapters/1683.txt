I want to kill to my heart’s content!

His voice resounded through Phecda City like a thunderclap.

Lu Lige glanced at Yang Ye and muttered, “Addicted to killing… Has this fellow… gone mad?”

Actually, Yang Ye did seem quite insane right now.

He was extremely unhappy. He didn’t want to return to the Yang Clan, but the Yang Clan forced him to return. However, after he returned to participate in the fight for succession, the Yang Clan felt he was a threat and wanted to eliminate him!

Death awaited if he didn’t return, and he had to die even after he returned!

Bullsh*t!

This was reality. The stronger party would never care about the weaker party’s feelings. It was like an emperor in the mortal world. If the emperor wanted his subject’s head, then that person would have no choice but to die. Why? Because the emperor was strong!

In a world where the strong were respected, the strong could do as they pleased, and the weak could only accept their fate!

“Cough!” Suddenly, a light cough resounded.

Yang Ye and Lu Lige turned towards its source. Two men were walking over slowly from afar. The leader of the group was the Yang Clan’s ninth young master, Yang Xian. There was a black robed man by Yang Xian’s side.

The black robed man was completely covered beneath the black robe, so it was impossible to see his appearance.

Yang Xian and the black robed man stopped when they were around 30m away from Yang Ye and Lu Lige. Yang Xian coughed lightly and gazed at Yang Jian’s cracked open head. A long time passed before he shook his head slightly and said, “That eldest brother of ours was quite a nice person.”

Yang Ye gazed at Yang Xian and said, “I think I’m quite a nice person too. However, that’s fucking useless. Right?”

Yang Xian looked up at Yang Ye, “Actually, I think that the clan acted quite unfairly in some things. For example, your father contributed to the clan, and while you haven’t contributed to the clan, you haven’t done anything wrong. So, it’s unfair for the clan to treat you like this!”

Yang Ye’s interest was instantly aroused, “I’m quite surprised. So, why don’t we join forces and oppose them?”

“Oppose them?” Yang Xian was slightly stunned, and then he shook his head, “We can’t. I’ve never thought about doing that as well. The clan hasn’t done anything for you, but it has for all of us. We wouldn’t have been able to attain our current accomplishments without the clan’s help.”

Yang Ye asked, “So?”

Yang Xian replied, “So, I think that while the clan is acting unfairly to you, you do deserve death.”

Yang Ye asked, “Why?”

Yang Xian replied, “Everything has its own level of importance. You’re not important, the clan is. Besides that, regardless of whether it’s me, our eldest brother, or the other young masters who become the successor, it wouldn’t be a bad thing for the clan. However, if you become the successor, the clan will definitely fall into internal strife. Because many people can’t rest at ease while you’re the successor. As far as they’re concerned, if you become the successor, then they’ll definitely stop at nothing to kill you. Besides that, your father has his old subordinates. They will definitely try to save you. So, the clan will fall into chaos!”

Yang Ye fell silent for a moment and smiled, “I never wanted to come here!”

Yang Xian replied, “But you still did!”

Yang Ye replied, “I was forced to!”

Yang Xian pondered deeply for a moment and replied, “We wanted you to come back, so you had to. Now, we want you to die, so you have to as well.”

Yang Ye chuckled, “I don’t want to die.”

Yang Xian nodded slightly, “No one does. But not everyone can control their own lives.” As he spoke, he flipped his palm, and a black halberd appeared in his grasp.

Once the halberd appeared in Yang Xian’s grasp, his bearing instantly changed. At this moment, he didn’t seem sickly anymore, and he was like a towering mountain that could hold up the sky.

Yang Ye glanced at him and asked, “Are you an Ancient Inheritor as well?”

Yang Xian shook his head slightly, “Not really. Even Yang Ru isn’t really one. However, we have gained the inheritances of some experts from the ancient times. But they can’t be considered to be true ancient cultivators. They are cultivators who appeared after those ancient cultivators vanished. So, they can only be considered to be normal cultivators and not ancient cultivators. They are just like us and are pursuing the first group of ancient cultivators from all those years ago.”

He paused for a moment and continued, “My inheritance is from a cultivator with the surname Lu, and this halberd is something he left behind. He had an extremely amazing horse as well. Unfortunately, it refused to acknowledge me and fled.”

Yang Ye pondered deeply for a moment and said, “Let’s begin!”

Yang Ye’s figure vanished on the spot once he finished speaking, and he was above Yang Xian when he appeared once more. He drew his sword and swung it down!

17 overlapped Heavenrends!

The space in the surroundings instantly cracked apart before his attack.

Yang Xian’s expression remained calm, and he just raised the halberd to block Yang Ye’s attack.

Clang!

The sound of metal colliding resounded, and the space in the surroundings collapsed. However, it only took a moment for the collapsed space to be repaired.

During this time, Yang Ye had been pushed around 1km away while Yang Xian had merely moved less than 300m back!

Yang Ye looked down at his right hand. At this moment, he couldn’t feel his hand anymore, and his entire arm was even covered in tiny cracks.

A moment of silence ensued, and then Yang Ye looked up at the halberd in Yang Xian’s grasp, “What rank is it?”

Yang Xian grinned, “Above the True Rank!”

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly.

Meanwhile, Yang Xian added, “Of course, it can only be considered to be at the Half-Step True Rank now. Because I don’t have the ability to fully unseal it. Come, try a swing of my halberd!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he vanished on the spot, and he was in front of Yang Ye when he appeared again. After that, he swung the halberd at Yang Ye.

Bang!

The powerful force it carried caused space to crack apart. Just like before, as soon as it cracked open, the space here was instantly repaired.

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly. He sheathed his sword, drew it, and swung it!

This time, he stopped holding back. It carried both of his intents, and he’d even activated the Demon God’s Energy and used the full extent of his physical strength.

Boom!

As soon as the sword and halberd collided, both shook violently. Yang Ye was pushed around 300m away while Yang Xian didn’t even take a step back.

Yang Ye looked down at his right hand. At this moment, it had cracked open completely, and blood was surging out incessantly. His entire arm was covered in blood, but the talisman which sealed his arm showed no signs of being damaged.

Yang Ye looked up at Yang Xian. Yang Xian’s strength had utterly exceeded his expectations. It wasn’t just Yang Xian’s weapon that was powerful, even Yang Xian’s strength was terrifying. However, it was probably not physical strength, it was another type of strength, and that strength was extremely overbearing and powerful!

Meanwhile, Yang Xian started walking slowly in Yang Ye’s direction, “Looks like you’ve noticed. It’s called Unrivaled Strength, and it’s a type of strength that doesn’t belong to the physical body. It’s overbearing and powerful. When cultivated to the advanced-stage, just a single flick of the finger can collapse the sky and split open the earth. Don’t worry, I’ve only cultivated it to the initial-stage. I’m still unable to accomplish what I just described!”

As soon as he finished speaking, his figure vanished on the spot, and then he appeared before Yang Ye and swung his halberd down.

Bang!

The space here wasn’t able to endure the might of his attack, and it collapsed in an instant. Yang Ye was about to use the Laws of Darkness, but the space here was repaired in an instant. This caused Yang Ye’s plan to fail, and it forced him to raise his sword to defend himself!

Bang!

A muffled explosion resounded, and Yang Ye was blasted a kilometer away again, and his arm, which had just been repaired by Primordial Violet Energy, had cracked open again!

Yang Xian walked slowly in Yang Ye’s direction, “You’re actually very strong. However, in the younger generation of the Yang Clan, besides that mysterious eldest sister of yours, I really don’t take anyone else seriously!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he vanished on the spot, and he was in front of Yang Ye when he appeared once more. After that, he just swung his halberd down in a very simple manner.

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly as he stabbed his sword forward. It stabbed against one of the side blades of the halberd.

Clang!

An ear piercing sound of collision resounded, and Yang Ye was pushed back again. This time, he was merely pushed less than 300m back while Yang Xian was pushed around 30m back.

Yang Xian shot a glance at Yang Ye while a trace of surprise flashed through his eyes, “The ability to locate the flaws in all techniques. It’s not bad indeed. Unfortunately, my strength will always surpass you. As they say, overwhelming strength can beat anything.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he vanished on the spot again. At the same moment that he vanished, Yang Ye vanished as well.

Yang Xian’s eyes instantly narrowed slightly when he saw Yang Ye vanish on the spot, and then a wave of terrifying intent swept out from him.

Bang!

Yang Ye, who’d just appeared behind Yang Xian, was instantly blasted 300m away by the intent.

Yang Ye looked at Yang Xian from afar, and his eyes narrowed slightly. Because Yang Xian’s intent was similarly powerful and overbearing, and it was at the Zenith Rank as well!

Yang Xian turned to look at Yang Ye, “Unrivaled Intent! It’s peerlessly overbearing and powerful!”

He paused for a moment and continued, “You act like a true man. I’m not willing to kill you, nor do I want to fight you. Because I’m at the Zenith Realm while you’re only at the Rebirth Realm. Moreover…”

He glanced at his halberd and continued, “I have this ultimate weapon in my possession. Even a True Realm expert would have to fear me, let alone you!”

“An ultimate weapon?” Yang Ye chuckled and shook his head, “Is that very rare? It just so happens that I have one too!”

Bang!

As soon as he finished speaking, a strand of flames suddenly surged out from within Yang Ye. In an instant, Yang Ye had turned fiery red, and his sword had been transformed into a flaming sword. Besides that, the powerful aura of fire he emanated had instantly pushed Yang Xian an entire 300m back!

At the same time, the temperature throughout Phecda City rose tremendously.

The Divine Yin Flame!
