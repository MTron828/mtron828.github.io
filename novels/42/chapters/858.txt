Translator: InVader

Editor: Conspiracing

A ray of sword energy flashed!

The black robed man’s expression had suddenly changed drastically when the sword energy appeared, and the profound energy within him instantly surged into his fingers. After that, he swiftly tapped his fingers forward, “Vortex Finger!”

As soon as he spoke, a white vortex appeared at the tip of his fingers, and it instantly absorbed Yang Ye’s sword energy.

In next to no time, the white vortex expanded larger and larger, and then it exploded apart 2 breaths of time later. A powerful wave of energy swept out swiftly in a circle, and the black robed man suffered the brunt of it. He was instantly blasted over 3km away before finally smashing against a huge mountain, causing even the mountain to tremble violently!

A long time later, the black robed man crawled out from the mountain, and Yang Ye had vanished.

“Bastard! You’re not from the Dao Order, you’re from the Ancient Sword School! We were tricked! Bastard!” The black robed man’s furious howls resounded through the air.

...

Martial Enlightenment City.

“Time’s up!” Kong Lian revealed a strange smile as she stretched out her hand to tap both Fan Li and Fan Meng’s foreheads. Both of them instantly woke up from their dazed state.

Kong Lian glanced at the two of them, and then her gaze descended onto Fan Meng, “I noticed that Yang Ye likes you better, so I’ll start with you!”

“Start with me!” Fan Li immediately stood in front of Fan Meng and said, “Didn’t you capture us to threaten Yang Ye? It’ll be useless against Yang Ye if you are to harm her. So, start with me!”

“Big Sister....” Fan Meng wanted to say something, but Fan Li suddenly shouted, “Shut up! Don’t say anything!”

“What a close pair of sisters!” Kong Lian walked over to Fan Li and said, “Since you want to go first, then you can.”

When she spoke up to this point, she turned around and gazed at everyone here, “From this moment onward, any one of you just has to pay a single energy stone to enjoy yourself with her, and you can do so until Yang Ye arrives!”

Fan Li’s expression changed while Fan Meng’s face instantly turned pale instead. She wanted to say something, but Fan Li glared fiercely at her.

Clamorous noise instantly resounded from the surroundings when Kong Lian spoke these words, but no one dared to step forward. What a joke! Who would dare to step forward in such a situation? The Dao Order wasn’t an existence they could afford to offend, but could they afford to offend the Ancient Sword School? Could they afford to offend Yang Ye?

Silence! There was absolutely silence in the surroundings!

Kong Lian laughed coldly and said, “No one dares? That’s fine. Since no one dares, then get some Beasts of Desire!”

It didn’t take long for over a dozen Beasts of Desire to be led to the city gates by a white robed man from the Dao Order.

Fan Li clenched her fists tightly, but there was no terror in her eyes. There was only icy coldness and a trace of despair!

“I wonder how Yang Ye would look when he returns and sees his women being used to death by these Beasts of Desire!” Kong Lian laughed coldly, and then she waved her hand. The Beasts of Desire immediately pounced at Fan Li.

“I don’t know how I’d look, but I know how you’d look when those Beasts of Desire are on top of you!” Suddenly, a voice resounded, and then a ray of light flashed. Those Beasts of Desire were instantly chopped into hundreds of pieces!

“Yang Ye!” Someone exclaimed.

Everyone here looked over towards the source of the voice, and they saw Yang Ye walking step by step towards the city gates with a sword chest on his back.

Fan Li’s body instantly slumped down weakly into Fan Meng’s arms when she saw Yang Ye, and her gaze carried a trace of indescribably complicated emotions as she looked at Yang Ye.

Kong Lian’s eyes narrowed slightly, and her sickle appeared in her grasp, “You came at just the right time!”

Yang Ye shot his gaze towards the city walls, and his right fist was slowly clenched tightly as he gazed at the corpses that hung on the city walls and the four others who were kneeling before the city gates. He closed his eyes for a moment, and then he took a deep breath and said, “In the end, all of this happened because of me. I, Yang Ye, swear to the heavens that I’ll definitely make the Dao Order pay in blood!”

He had responsibility that couldn’t be avoided for the deaths of those disciples from the Ancient Sword School. After all, if he hadn’t pretended to be a disciple of the Ancient Sword School, then it wouldn’t have been swept into this enmity at all. He was a selfish person, but this time, he truly felt that he owed the Ancient Sword School too much!

Kong Lian spoke in a low voice, “There are corpses of my Dao Order’s disciples there as well!”

Yang Ye gazed at her and said, “They deserved death!”

Kong Lian was furious, and she said, “Good! Very good! Yang Ye, you really are arrogant and overbearing! Let me see how long more you can stay that way!”

Yang Ye’s left hand moved slightly, and then the ancient sheath appeared in his grasp. After that, he placed a Dao Rank sword within it. Yang Ye said, “The enmity between me and the Dao Order started from Liu Sha. That day, he wanted to kill me. Unfortunately, he failed, and I killed him instead. Your Dao Order wanted to take revenge, so it placed the Hell’s Coffin in my path and wanted me to get in myself. I refused and had no choice but to destroy them, and then I killed more members of your Dao Order. Just like that, your Dao Order has been constantly sending more and more disciples to kill me. Each was stronger than the last, but all were killed by me!”

When he spoke up to this point, Yang Ye paused for a moment, “What I want to say is that if others don’t offend me, then I won’t offend anyone. But if someone does offend me, then I’ll annihilate everyone related to that person!”

As soon as he finished speaking, the sword in the ancient sheath suddenly left its sheath, and a strand of sword energy shot towards Kong Lian. The sword energy was extremely swift like a bolt of lightning, and many weren’t even able to see its trajectory clearly. However, it suddenly shattered into pieces when it was less than 6m away from her!

“I’m not your opponent!” Kong Lian laughed with ridicule and moved aside.

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly while a trace of seriousness appeared in his eyes. That attack of him contained 10 overlapped Heavenrends! However, it had been destroyed. He shot his gaze towards the young man who sat cross-legged before the city gates. At this moment, that young man was standing up slowly, and he was looking at Yang Ye as well.

“It uses an instant of explosive force, and it was even overlapped. That’s a really good sword technique!” The young man stood up and walked step by step towards Yang Ye. After he stood up, everyone finally noticed that his legs didn’t have any soles.

Yang Ye said, “You were able to detect the trajectory of my sword energy, and even blast it apart. You can be ranked in the top 3 amongst the experts of the younger generation that I’ve met!” The 1st and the 2nd were naturally Nether Maiden and An Nanjing.

The young man said, “Remember that my name is Nan Ketu, and I’m a Dao Order Steward. I’m ranked at the 9th position amongst the Dao Order Stewards. The reason I asked you to remember my name was because I’ll be the last enemy in your life.”

“I won’t remember it!” Yang Ye looked the young man in the eyes and said, “Because I’m not interested in the names of the dead!”

Nan Ketu gazed at Yang Ye for a short while, and then he grinned, “Kong Lian really was correct. You’re very overbearing and arrogant. I hadn’t intended to waste my breath on you but allow me to waste my breath for a moment. These soles of mine hadn’t been sliced off by someone, it was I who used them to the point they were worn away. I pursued the truth of the Martial Dao since I was 7 years old. I strode through the hills and valleys of Pine Prefecture, and I traveled through more than half of it. While I lost the soles of my feet, I comprehended a lot. Amongst them was the Laws of Speed. I think that I can kill you with a single move. What do you think?”

The Laws!

Yang Ye wasn’t surprised because he’d expected it when Nan Ketu attacked earlier. After all, Nan Ketu’s speed couldn’t be simply described as being swift. Because even the teleportation of the violet mink was probably inferior to his speed. Only the energy of the Laws could accomplish such a feat. There were a myriad of laws in the world, and he’d finally seen another Law besides his Decay Laws and Nether Maiden’s Laws!

Just as Mu Hanshan had said, the Dao Order really was just playing with him before this. Because those fellows from before weren’t just a little bit inferior when compared to Nan Ketu!

Nan Ketu continued, “I’m actually not interested in torturing people. Unfortunately, not only did you kill members of my Dao Order, but you even humiliated my Dao Order. So, my Dao Order will make you die with everlasting regret. My Dao Order has investigated your background and wasn’t able to find your family. We only were able to find out that those sisters from the Fan Clan seem to be yours. I’ll treat them the same way you treated Man Ba earlier, and I’ll do it in front of you and countless other disciples of the Ancient Sword School!”

“Is the Laws of Speed really that formidable?” Yang Ye chuckled and said, “Since you’re so confident, then why don’t we make a bet?”

“What bet?” Nan Ketu said, “Indeed, that would be a little more interesting. After all, wouldn’t it be too boring if I just ended your life like that?”

Yang Ye said, “We’ll bet with 100,000 extreme-grade energy stones and the freedom of the sisters from the Fan Clan, alright?”

Nan Ketu said, “I have 100,000 extreme-grade energy stones, and the sisters of the Fan Clan are in my possession as well. But do you have that many energy stones? Even if you do, what do you possess that’s of the same value as those sisters?”

Yang Ye withdrew a spatial ring that contained 100,000 extreme-grade energy stones, and he said, “There are 100,000 extreme-grade energy stones in this spatial ring. I didn’t hide its content, so you should be able to detect them. As for the sisters from the Fan Clan, how about we do this. You tell me what you want, and I’ll see if I have it. Alright?”

“I suddenly realized that those energy stones of yours would be mine if I kill you with just a single move!” Nan Ketu spoke abruptly, “As for any other things as the wager, I’ll be killing you anyway, so would you even be able to do anything for me then?”

Yang Ye said, “Then tell me what you want to bet on!”

Nan Ketu replied, “How about we do this? If I incapacitate you with a single move, then you’ll kneel from here until you reach my Dao Order, and you’ll constantly shout ‘I, Yang Ye, was wrong, and my Ancient Sword School was wrong’, alright? Don’t worry, the experts of my Dao Order will definitely protect you until you kneel your way to the Dao Order!”

Yang Ye didn’t hesitate to answer, “Alright!”

Bang!

Yang Ye had just finished speaking when everyone saw his figure being blasted flying!

However, Nan Ketu was still standing on the spot.Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates
