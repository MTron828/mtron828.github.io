Chapter 2482 – Eternal Kingdom!

Book 21 — Eternal Kingdom

Erya, Snowy, and An Nanjing had left!

Yang Ye felt a little empty. Now, he noticed that he’d been used to their presence, he’d become used to everyone by his side!

It was how people usually were. They would only cherish something when they lost it.

Luckily, Snowy and Erya were only going with An Nanjing and Yang Lianshuang to have some fun!

Yang Ye calmed himself and gazed at Elder Yuan, “Elder Yuan, I’ll leave everything here to you. If it’s necessary, you can seek help from the desolate race.”

Elder Yuan nodded slightly, “Just be careful!”

Yang Ye smiled, “You too!”

Yang Ye didn’t stay a while longer and vanished into the sky.

In the Primordial Pagoda, the Primal True Dragon was the leader of the demon beasts now that Erya and Snowy had left.

All the demons had a gloomy expression on their faces as they stood on the Ascension Platform.

They were very reluctant to see Erya and Snowy leave. They were used to their presence.

However, life still had to go on!

The dragon suddenly said, “Train!”

Train!

All of the others shuddered!

At this moment, they recalled what Erya had told them.

She’d said that the first thing she did upon returning was to spar with them.

That wasn’t even the most important part, she’d also promised to bury them if they died!

It didn’t take long for them to leave the Primordial Pagoda and head toward the lightning.

It was very painful, but they had to admit that it was very, very effective. Yang Ye and Erya weren’t the only ones who’d benefited tremendously, they too had received huge benefits.

It could be said that they far surpassed demon beasts in their realm of cultivation.

They were a group of great demons with extremely terrifying combat strengths!

Moreover, they were growing stronger and stronger!

…

Yang Ye didn’t head straight for Eternal River. He went to Eternal Border instead. In a spot in space at Eternal Border, Yang Ye arrived before a pitch black palace.

There were three characters at the top of it ‘守护者’.

Guardians!

Practically everyone in Eternal Border who’d hunted him down had been annihilated. However, there was one power left, the Guardians. He naturally wouldn’t forget them!

Yang Ye went to the palace, but it was empty.

Yang Ye scanned it with his divine sense, but he sensed no signs of life.

They were gone!

Yang Ye glanced at the palace and swung his sword.

Hiss!

The black palace was instantly sliced into bits by countless rays of sword energy.

Yang Ye turned around and left.

Around an hour later, Yang Ye arrived beneath the ground of the Northern Sword Sect.

Chen Xuanan asked, “Are you heading to Eternal Kingdom?”

Yang Ye nodded.

Chen Xuanan nodded slightly, “It’s good to gain some experience and see it for yourself. The civilization in the Martial Dao there is the greatest in the universe right now.”

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and asked, “Senior, people always say the civilization in the Martial Dao, so are there no others like the Mortal Dao? Or perhaps the Spirit Dao or Physical Dao?”

Chen Xuanan smiled, “What are you trying to say?”

Yang Ye replied, “I came to see you because I wanted to seek your guidance about something. In my opinion, the longer people live, the greater their fear is of death and the greater their ambition is. Because as far as they are concerned, nothing else is necessary besides life, and they can abandon everything else. Nothing is more important than the Grand Dao of eternal life. Everything is but an ant before eternal life, and that is what many people think!”

Chen Xuanan replied, “Is that wrong? Everyone has their own selfish desires. If you have 10,000 Immortal Crystals now, you’ll want 20,000 a while later. After that, you’ll seek 100,000! The desires and ambitions of man are endless. Once they have something nice, they seek something better. That is how the heart of man works, and strictly speaking, it isn’t wrong.”

Yang Ye fell silent.

Desire and ambition!

Who could escape all of that?

Chen Xuanan continued, “I understand what you’re trying to say. You think that our world is too cruel because only the strong are respected. However, you must realize that because everyone is cultivating, the world is cruel due to their endless fight for resources. This fight for resources isn’t just limited to our world, it occurs in every single world. I’ve lived longer, from the ancient times until now, so I’ve seen much, much more. In conclusion, I can say, it’s the survival of the fittest!”

Yang Ye laughed bitterly and didn’t say anything else.

Chen Xuanan said, “You’re a sword cultivator, a sword cultivator who cherishes your emotions and relationships. But yours is but a minor form of it, and not the major form of it. Your sword fights for your loved ones, and that is a form of restraint, a restraint of your own Sword Dao. But it’s fine, everything must be done slowly, even the Sword Dao. Everything requires a process. Finally, let me tell you something. True cultivators and true experts do not disregard the lives of the weak, and they do not seek joy from killing or bullying the weak. If a day comes when you’re strong to a certain extent, I hope you’ll still be able to stay true to your heart!”

Yang Ye bowed to Chen Xuanan and left.

Once Yang Ye left, Chen Xuanan shook his head and smiled, “His heart, it’s a kind one in the end.”

It was why he thought so highly of Yang Ye. If Yang Ye was an absolutely selfish person or one who would stop at nothing to get what he wanted, then Chen Xuanan would absolutely not help Yang Ye. Yang Ye was cruel and ruthless, but he wasn’t without a heart. Or to be more precise, emotions still remained in his heart.

As far as Chen Xuanan was concerned, being cruel and ruthless to one’s enemies wasn’t wrong.

Being kind and benevolent to one’s enemies?

People who did that never lived for long.

…

Yang Ye left the Northern Sword Sect and arrived at the Eternal River. This time, no demon beasts stopped him. After all, many demon beasts had personally witnessed Yang Ye and Erya subdue the Primal Royal Crocodile and go all the way through the Eternal River.

That mysterious little girl was someone that every one of the demon beasts here feared!

Yang Ye smoothly arrived before the Universe Wall, and he withdrew the Universe Seal as he gazed at it.

Yang Ye issued a command in his heart, and the seal shook. A short while later, the seal pressed against the wall, and then the wall gradually split apart at the center!

Once it was split open, a strand of extremely powerful spirit energy surged out from the other side!

It was spirit energy that was purer than the spirit energy in Eternal Border!

The entire Eternal River started to roil.

The demon beasts here sensed the aura of Eternal Kingdom.

Yang Ye walked in, and the wall closed, causing countless demon beasts throughout Eternal River to roar.

Not too far away from the Universe Wall, a woman was standing there silently. It was Nanli Meng.

Nanli Meng gazed at the wall for a long time. Suddenly, she looked to the side, and a black clothed man soundlessly appeared there.

The black clothed man bowed respectfully to her, “Miss Meng, both Eternal Kingdom and the desolate race have come to us. Now, we must make a choice. Master asked me to seek your opinion.”

Nanli Meng replied indifferently, “What does he think?”

The black clothed man shook his head, “I do not know. I’m only in charge of passing his message!”

Nanli Meng fell silent for a short while and asked, “Are we unable to delay longer?”

The black clothed man replied solemnly, “I’m afraid that’s impossible. Both of them have lost their patience. If we try to delay, we’ll offend both sides, and that is worse.”

Nanli Meng fell silent for a long time before she asked, “What’s their attitude toward Eternal Border?”

The black clothed man hesitated for a moment and said, “Eternal Border will be the new battlefield. Because both of them will not fight in their own territory unless it’s the final moment to decide the outcome of the entire war. In other words, Eternal Border will cease to exist after the war. Eternal Border was lucky to survive all those years ago because of the Sprite Progenitor, but the current Sprite Progenitor…”

He was quite speechless at this point.

According to his investigations, the Sprite Progenitor was nothing more than a cute pet now!

Could she save the world? That was impossible! Yang Ye was her world, and she would only save Yang Ye. But Yang Ye had no ties to Eternal Border, so ask him to save Eternal Border? That was even more impossible. It was good enough that he wasn’t destroying it himself.𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

So, as far as the black clothed man was concerned, Eternal Border was finished!

Nanli Meng nodded, “I understand. Tell him not to side with any of them. We are nothing but cannon fodder to both of them. Even if there’s a way out of it, it’ll be a path made of blood.”

The black clothed man laughed bitterly, “Miss Meng, we have no other choice. We can’t afford to offend Eternal Kingdom of the desolate race. They will never allow a power like ours to stay neutral at a time like this either. After all, they don’t want us to reap the rewards instead. So, we must choose even if we don’t want to.”

Nanli Meng glanced at him, “If we can’t afford to offend them, can’t we hide from them?”

The man hesitated for a moment and asked, “Where will we hide?”

Nanli Meng replied, “The Origin World, Huaxia. Tell him to adopt the right attitude there and do his best to keep a low profile while striving to make them accept all of you there.”

The black clothed man hesitated for a moment and said, “Is that a power that belongs to Yang Ye?”

She nodded, “If you’re able to make them let you stay, then Huang Ying may give Yang Ye face and just let us be. Of course, I dare not say for sure if he will do that, but we can try.”

The black clothed man thought for a moment and said, “Farewell.”

He vanished on the spot.

Nanli Meng glanced at the Universe Wall, “Take care!”

She vanished on the spot as well.
