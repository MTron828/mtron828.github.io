The young girl was clearly right there, but they couldn’t see her.

Why?

Why am I able to see her? But why isn’t this fellow, Ning Jun, who’s a Half-Saint able to as well?

Yang Ye was very puzzled.

Meanwhile, Ning Jun asked once more, “You killed those members of my Endless Alliance, right?”

Yang Ye nodded and said, “I killed two.”

“Give me a reason not to kill you!” Ning Jun spoke in a low voice.

“You can give it a try if you have the ability.” Right at this moment, the voice of a woman resounded. Ning Jun’s expression changed as he turned around to look, and he saw a woman floating over from afar.

It was Nether Maiden.

Ning Jun frowned when he saw her. Suddenly, he seemed to have thought of something, and he immediately revealed shock in his eyes as he said, “You... you’re Nether Maiden!”

“I killed members of your Endless Alliance as well. Do you want to kill me as well?” said Nether Maiden.

Ning Jun’s face fell, and he said, “Your highness, Nether Maiden, there’s no enmity between my alliance and you, so may I know why you’ve killed members of my alliance?”

“They deserved death!” Nether Maiden didn’t provide much of an explanation, “Attack if you want to avenge them.”

“Aren’t you going a little too far!?” Ning Jun’s face was gloomy.

This time, Nether Maiden paid no further attention to him. She just gazed at Yang Ye and said, “Let’s go!” She turned around and left once she finished speaking.

Yang Ye shook his head as he suppressed the shock and bewilderment in his heart, and he followed behind her.

In the end, Ning Jun didn’t attack. He just led the group away instead. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“You caused trouble again!” Nether Maiden spoke as they walked.

Yang Ye replied, “Would you believe me if I said that I wasn’t the one who started it?”

She nodded, “I would!”

“Huh!?” Yang Ye was slightly astounded, “You really believe me?”

She nodded in response.

“Why?” asked Yang Ye.

She stopped moving, fell silent for a while, and then said, “I wouldn’t have invited you if you were one who liked to create trouble. Killing is unavoidable in this world because there are always incidents where others would refuse to let you go. Just like what happened at the entrance of the city. So, killing is a very ordinary thing. However, I don’t like those people who intentionally create trouble.”

Yang Ye glanced at her and said, “You’ve really made me feel quite surprised!”

She replied, “You too!”

Both of their words carried hidden meanings behind them.

Nether Maiden suddenly said, “We have to stay here for a night!”

“Why?”

She answered, “That Divine Talisman Master doesn’t have what I need for now. So, he asked me to wait one night. We aren’t leaving the city tonight. You must be cautious while residing within the city. I know you’re very strong, and you’re even capable of fighting Half-Saints. However, there are many things here that exceed the scope of your understanding!”

Yang Ye nodded as he deeply agreed. After all, Yin’yin might not be a Half-Saint, but she was even more terrifying than a Half-Saint.

Yang Ye suddenly said, “Right, what about Wang Yan and Qing Ming? Will they be fine?”

She replied, “It’s fine, even if they do encounter any danger, their strengths are more than enough to protect themselves. Moreover, they’re comparatively amiable people, and they don’t take pleasure in fighting and killing.”

Yang Ye was speechless.

Nether Maiden said, “The difference between you and them is that they know when to stop, but you don’t. Moreover, you’d even kill with all your might. So, they’re able to leave safely even if they encounter any problems, but you would make a small problem become a huge problem instead. You have to do something about your temper!”

Yang Ye smiled and said, “Thank you for the warning!”

She stopped moving, and then gazed at a tower in front of her and said, “We’ll stay here tonight!”

Yang Ye raised his head to look over, and he noticed that the tower had over 10 levels, and there were 3 words inscribed there, Tower of Buddha.

“Let’s go!” Nether Maiden walked in, and then Yang Ye followed right after her.

There was a stone counter not too far from the entrance, and an old man with snow white hair was seated behind it. The old man was resting on a chair with his eyes slightly closed, and he seemed like he was sleeping.

“The entrance fee is 10 extreme-grade energy stones. The cultivation rooms on the 2nd floor cost 200, the 3rd floor is 300... the 9th floor is 900.” The old man didn’t even open his eyes as he spoke.

Nether Maiden flicked her finger, and then 180 extreme-grade energy stones flew onto the counter. The old man finally opened his eyes, and then he tossed 2 golden keys towards Yang Ye and Nether Maiden, “The room numbers are written on them. Just enter the corresponding room!”

Nether Maiden took the key, and then she led Yang Ye up the tower.

“What exactly is this city?” Yang Ye asked as they walked towards their rooms. The first impression he had was that the city was chaotic, and the second thing he felt was that it was mysterious. Everything here was mysterious.

“It’s heaven for many because there’s no order or rules here. You can do as you please if you have the strength. Even though there are powers here, it’s very normal for the powers here to rise and fall. For example, Endless Alliance didn’t exist a month ago,” said Nether Maiden.

“Does the Hallowed Halls not manage this place?” asked Yang Ye.

She replied, “It’s not that it doesn’t want to, but it can’t!”

Yang Ye’s eyelids twitched, and he said, “Even the Hallowed Halls can’t?”

The Hallowed Halls was a power that represented the human race in the Hallowed Grounds. While the Ancient City of Hallows had many powers within it, they were all within the Hallowed Halls’ management. Of course, many elders and figures who possessed authority in the Hallowed Halls came from those extraordinary clans and powers.

However, he had no doubt that the Hallowed Halls far surpassed the clans and powers. Because it had its Hallowed Lord and 2 Supreme Exalts. Especially the Hallowed Lord, he was the number 1 expert in the Hallowed Grounds. So, all races had to obey the orders of the Hallowed Halls.

The Hallowed Halls was the strongest power in the entire Hallowed Grounds. But Nether Maiden said that it couldn’t control and manage Nameless City, so it made Yang Ye feel very puzzled and curious.

Nether Maiden fell silent for a short while before she spoke again, “This city has another name, the City of Sin.” When she spoke up to this point, she stopped moving, turning around, gazed at Yang Ye, and spoke in a very serious tone, “I wasn’t afraid that you would offend a power like the Endless Alliance when I told you not to cause trouble. I was afraid that you would offend someone or some power that you can’t afford to offend.” She fell silent once she spoke up to this point.

Yang Ye laughed bitterly and said, “Hey, don’t stop halfway. Beating around the bush is a bad habit!”

“There are many people here who aren’t from Profounder Continent! They are from the Outer Heavens!” said Nether Maiden solemnly.

The Outer Heavens! Yang Ye’s expression changed, and he said, “How could that be possible? The people from the Outer Heavens can come to our world with ease?”

She replied, “Of course. But the precondition is that they aren’t at the Saint Realm.”

“Why would they come here?” asked Yang Ye.

“They didn’t come here because they wanted to. Most of them were exiled here or were forced to come here by their enemies. In short, regardless of the reason, they’re bound to suffer a miserable fate.” She continued, “The defiant profounders are confined here, and those fellows above us intend to use this world to bury the defiant profounders. On the other hand, they are here to be buried alongside the defiant profounders. It isn’t just them, all the myriad of living beings on this world will suffer the same fate!”

Yang Ye spoke abruptly, “All of you are willing to be buried with them?” That was the biggest question in his heart. Because while the defiant profounders would perish once the world collapsed, how could the members of the Hallowed Grounds survive?

“There’s a way to survive!” She said, “If the defiant profounders are killed before the world collapses, then a small number of people will be able to live.”

“But the defiant profounders can’t be killed!” said Yang Ye in a low voice.

She replied, “In the past, that was indeed the case. But it isn’t the same now. The undying bodies of the defiant profounders will cease to exist in some time from now. At that time, they just have to be annihilated, and then the Heavenpath would be opened and some would be allowed to leave this world.”

Yang Ye asked, “Who are these ‘some people’ that you speak of?”

She replied, “Existences at the ninth rank of the Monarch Realm and above!”

“In other words, even if the defiant profounders are killed, those below the ninth rank of the Monarch Realm will still have to die?” said Yang Ye.

She replied, “That’s the only way, or everyone will die!”

Yang Ye fell silent. Now, he finally understood why the members of the Hallowed Grounds were killing the defiant profounders with all their might. It was because they would die if they couldn’t kill the defiant profounders.

She explained, “Nameless City is filled with many who are from the Outer Heavens. Even though they aren’t at the Saint Realm, most of their strengths are extremely terrifying. At the very least, it’s extremely terrifying in this world of ours. Of course, if the Hallowed Grounds united and paid a heavy price, then it would still be possible to annihilate them. However, it isn’t necessary. Because all of us will only be able to live if we kill the defiant profounders. So, we refrain from attacking each other.”

Yang Ye nodded. Now, he’d gained a slight understanding of Yin’yin’s background.

“What I just spoke about is top-secret information in the Hallowed Grounds!” She suddenly gazed at him and said, “Do you know why I told you all of this?”

He shook his head in response. Indeed, if news of this were to spread, then there would be no need to wait for the defiant profounders to emerge because the Hallowed Grounds would fall into chaos on its own.

She looked him in the eyes and said, “Because I hope that you’ll stand on our side. Only by making you stand on our side would all of us have a chance at survival!” As soon as she finished speaking, Nether Maiden’s figure flashed and vanished before him.

Yang Ye stood silently on the spot. A long time passed before he shook his head, and then he turned around and walked into his room.

...

At this moment, there was an old man standing within the room.

The old man was none other than Man Yuan from the Man Clan!

“Yang Man, I’ve been waiting for you!” Man Yuan waved his right hand, and then 4 black flags shot into the corners of the room. In an instant, a multicolored barrier of light appeared within the room.

“This is a precious treasure of my Man Clan, and it’s at the Saint Rank as well. No one outside this barrier will be able to notice anything even if the heavens and the earth collapse here! Even if someone in the outside world notices it, even Nether Maiden would find it absolutely impossible to break through in a short period of time. So, Yang Man, you’re dead!” Man Yuan laughed savagely.

“It isolates us from the outside world? Awesome!” Yang Ye flipped his palm, and then Lunar Reverie appeared in his grasp.
