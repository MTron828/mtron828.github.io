Chapter 1960 – Confidence!

What if his sword couldn’t stop them!

Yang Ye fell silent.

At this moment, he suddenly thought of something.

Setbacks!

Even though he’d experienced endless problems throughout his lifetime, he’d rarely faced any setbacks. Problems and setbacks weren’t the same.

Meanwhile, A’Man suddenly said, “I presume you suffered a lot to be able to attain the Enlightened Realm at such a young age and possess such strength. But…”

She pointed at the others and continued, “Everyone here is an extraordinary genius from the various races. I’m not trying to preach to you, and I just want to tell you that you better be mentally prepared when you’re here. You must be prepared to face pain and death.” Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Yang Ye fell silent for a short while and looked up at the city walls, “Let me do it!”

A'Man glanced at Yang Ye, and then she looked up at Gu Li, “You can come down now!”

Gu Li slammed his fists forward swiftly, and both the wyverns moved backwards repeatedly.

They were avoiding him!

Gu Li’s might forced them to avoid him!

Gu Li returned to A’Man’s side, nodded slightly to Yang Ye, and then left.

Yang Ye’s figure shook and appeared on the city walls.

Meanwhile, those two wyverns dived down at him.

A’Man and some of the others watched from below.

Yang Ye and the two wyverns entered into fierce battle again. However, Yang Ye was being constantly suppressed without his sword.

Fortunately, he had the Primordial Violet Energy to repair his body, so he was barely able to resist them.

Suddenly, A’Man shouted from below, “You’re not allowed to heal yourself!”

Bitterness instantly covered Yang Ye’s face. He didn’t ask her why and just suppressed the Primordial Violet Energy within him.

Below the city wall.

Gu Li spoke abruptly while he stood by A’Man’s side, “It’s very dangerous!”

A’Man looked at Yang Ye, “Haven’t you noticed? He’s very confident!”

Gu Li gazed at her with a puzzled expression in his eyes.

A’Man explained, “He’s naturally confident. Confidence is a good thing, but he doesn’t realize that it’s very likely to cause his death. Just like what happened to me. I thought my strength was sufficient to deal with any danger when I first arrived here. However, reality told me that I didn’t possess such strength, and I almost died before I realized that!”

She gazed at Yang Ye who was in a difficult battle and continued, “Moreover, that fellow has potential. Since I encountered him here, I should help him if I can.”

Gu Li suddenly asked, “You’ve been to Hell Mountain Range, right?”

Many others’ ears instantly perked up when they heard Gu Li.

Hell Mountain Range!

Most of them had only heard of it and hadn’t entered it. It was a forbidden place to them.

A’Man glanced at them and gazed at Ling, “Ling, you’ve been in there too. How about you tell them about it?”

Ling fell silent for a short while and said, “It’s dangerous!”

Qin Chuan suddenly asked, “How dangerous?”

Ling shook his head and didn’t say anything.

Everyone gazed at A’Man.

A’Man glanced at the sky outside the city, and it was in the direction of Hell Mountain Range. A long time passed before she said, “There are many types of dangers lurking there. Firstly, the demons that survived the destruction of this planet. Secondly, poison mist. Besides that, it’s the cannibals in the mountain range. The deeper you go, the more dangerous it gets. I’ve gone less than 500km into it before I encounter a strange demon, and I couldn’t go any further.”

She paused for a moment and continued, “Let’s all work harder. We can’t stay in this damnable place forever!”

All of them nodded. As far as they were concerned, Hell Mountain Range was mysterious and dangerous, but they were curious about it.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye was still bitterly fighting the wyverns.

At this moment, he was covered in injuries from the battle, truly covered in injuries. Because he didn’t allow the Primordial Violet Energy to heal his body, so his body was no different than an ordinary person’s body right now.

However, those wyverns were covered in injuries too.

It was terrible!

Both Yang Ye and those wyverns were in quite a terrible state!

While he was in quite a bad state, Yang Ye didn’t use his sword or the Primordial Violet Energy!

Since others could do it, he could too!

Just like that, time trickled by, and it didn’t take long for the sun to rise in the horizon.

As soon as that happened, the wyverns in fierce battle with Yang Ye immediately vanished into the sky.

Once they left, Yang Ye fell weakly onto the city wall.

He was exhausted!

Truly exhausted!

He hadn’t experienced this feeling in a very long time!

Meanwhile, A’Man appeared beside him. She glanced at Yang Ye and said, “How do you feel?”

Yang Ye opened his eyes to look at her, and he laughed bitterly, “Exhausted!”

A’Man nodded slightly, “That’s how you should feel. Do you know why I didn’t let you heal yourself?”

Yang Ye shook his head.

A’Man said, “It was the moment your body was at its most exhausted state, and it’s almost the best time for your body to transform. If you healed it with profound energy, you would never know where your body’s limits are.”

She kicked Yang Ye’s legs lightly, “Stand up!”

Yang Ye laughed bitterly. While he was absolutely exhausted, he still stood up.

Meanwhile, A’Man continued, “Amongst all the races, the devil race’s method of cultivating the body is the cruelest. Because they usually have to endure inhumane torture, and the pain is far worse than anything you can imagine. However, its effects are very good. If you healed your body earlier, the bitter battle you just underwent would lose at least 70% of its benefits!”

Yang Ye glanced at her and said, “Why are you helping me?”

“Helping you?” She chuckled, “Never forget that helping another here is equivalent to helping yourself. Stay united and grow stronger together. Only then will we have a chance to leave this place and even go home.”

Yang Ye frowned, “All of you can’t go back?”

Suddenly, A’Man asked, “You’re an independent cultivator?”

Yang Ye replied with astonishment, “How did you know?”

A’Man sized up Yang Ye and said, “That’s quite rare. An independent cultivator getting this far. Do you know that some of us were forced in here, and some were sent here by their own clans?”

Yang Ye asked, “Why?”

A’Man smiled, “The powers that back up need strong experts, and this place can help a person become strong. Only people who emerge from this place can be truly considered as geniuses. Moreover, those who emerge from here aren’t just true geniuses, they will be extraordinary experts in the future.”

Yang Ye nodded to display his agreement.

In the outside world, Yang Ye felt that while he wasn’t unmatched in the younger generation, there were definitely few who could rival him. However, there were over 60 people here. Experts really filled this place.

Every single one of them wasn’t ordinary!

Geniuses!

All of the people here were truly qualified to be called geniuses.

Meanwhile, A’Man said, “If it’s a one on one battle, then besides Mad Saber and Ling, none of the others here are able to rival my strength. However, if all of you join forces, then it wouldn’t even take many of you. Just the joint forces of around three or four of you would have a very good chance to kill me!”

She gazed at Yang Ye at this point, “Just like you. I know that you definitely have trump cards, but even if you used all of them, I dare guarantee that just the joint forces of any three people here would be enough to kill you! Do you believe me?”

Yang Ye glanced at them and replied, “I do!”

Just from the strength Gu Li displayed against those two wyverns, Yang Ye knew that all the others here weren’t ordinary at all.

But it did make sense.

All of them were the best geniuses of the various races!

They were fostered by the strongest powers in the outside world, and then they entered this place to temper themselves. So, wouldn’t they be absolute idiots if they still remained weak?

A’Man continued, “You just arrived here, so you don’t know much about this place. However, I hope you remember two things. Firstly, never underestimate any person, demon, or living beings. Secondly, don’t try to play tricks in a group. Because it’ll only speed up your death.”

She flipped her palm at this point, and two immortal crystals appeared before Yang Ye, “Heal up. If you want, you can continue training every day.”

She turned around and left once she finished speaking.

Suddenly, Yang Ye asked, “Why?”

He was asking about her intentions.

A’Man stopped and said, “You need to have trust if you want to leave this place alive. Everyone here trusts me. Since they trust me, I’m responsible for them. Have you trusted anyone? Or perhaps has anyone put their trust in you?”

Trust!

Yang Ye fell silent!

A’Man said, “If you haven’t experienced that, your life is really quite sad, isn’t it?”

She vanished into the distance once she finished speaking.

Suddenly, Qin Chuan appeared by Yang Ye’s side, and he smiled, “It’s the first time I’ve seen her say so much. Looks like you’re definitely not ordinary, otherwise she wouldn’t have said so much to you.”

Yang Ye smiled as he shook his head, and he didn’t say anything.

Meanwhile, Qin Chuan flicked an immortal crystal to Yang Ye, “I don’t have more, just this one. Don’t refuse it because you’ve suffered such heavy injuries, so two immortal crystals won’t be enough to heal yourself!”

He left once he finished speaking.

Yang Ye stared blankly at the immortal crystal before him.
