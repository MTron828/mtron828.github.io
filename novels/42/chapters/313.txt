Chapter 314 – 6th Level Saber Inten

t

“I can’t tell you that!” The white haired woman finished speaking, glanced at Yang Ye, and then turned around and left. This time, she seemed to not want Yang Ye to continue bothering her, so she sped up, and merely an instant had passed before her figure was already over 30m away!

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment, and then his profound energy surged to activate the Gale Shows, and he transformed into a black ray of light that chased after her! He didn’t want to pester her, but this matter was truly strange, and he kept having the feeling that some sort of plot was being laid out against him. But he wasn’t able to put his finger on it. It was merely a feeling!

Yang Ye’s expression gradually turned solemn because he noticed that even with the boost provided by the Gale Shoes and a Strider Talisman, not only had the gap between him and the white haired woman showed no signs of being reduced, it was being dragged apart instead. They were 30m apart earlier, yet they were around 100m apart now!

Moreover, the woman seemed to be completely immune to the cold winds here, and they didn’t affect her at all. On the other hand, he had to ceaselessly utilize his Sword Intent to resist the cold winds. This was naturally not a problem if it was at any other time because it would just consume some of his profound energy. But now, such consumption was extremely serious!

Who exactly is she?

Even though he hadn’t fought her, Yang Ye believed that her strength was absolutely not weaker than the three outstanding geniuses of the central territory, and it was even to the extent that she was stronger than them!

Besides that, who’s that father she speaks of? Why does he want her to marry the Sword Emperor? Am I the Sword Emperor or am I not? It’s fine if I’m not the Sword Emperor, but if I am, then what exactly is his objective?

After thinking for a long time, Yang Ye was unable to figure out an answer! So, he shook his head and stopped thinking about it.

Yang Ye took a deep breath as he gazed at the white haired woman who was going further and further away from him. He knew that if he didn’t think of a way and allowed this to continue, then he would be absolutely unable to catch up to her!

When he thought up to here, Yang Ye pondered deeply for a moment. Suddenly, his eyes lit up. He noticed that he seemed to have forgotten something all this while, and it was that the Sword Control Technique could allow him to control a sword and fly! In the past, the consumption of profound energy caused by the Sword Control technique was too terrifying, and it wasn’t worth to utilize at the First Heaven Realm!

But now, he was already at the King Realm, and the profound energy within his body couldn’t be compared to while he was at the First Heaven Realm. So, wasn’t it the best time to try controlling a sword to fly on it?

When he thought up to here, Yang Ye stopped hesitating. A sword transformed into a ray of light that arrived in front of him, and then he leaped up and descended onto it. After that, he issued a command in his heart, and it transformed into a ray of light that shot explosively towards the distance!

Bang!

Yang Ye wasn’t able to react in time because it had suddenly sped up, so the sword flew forward while Yang Ye himself fell to the ground. He smashed heavily onto the ground and smashed a deep hole open where he landed! However, fortunately, his physical body was strong, so such an impact was nothing to him!

Yang Ye was extremely delighted as he stood up because he noticed that flying on a sword wasn’t a dream! Even though he’d fallen from his sword, it was merely because he hadn’t gotten accustomed to it. The Sword Control Technique could really allow him to control a sword and fly on it. Of course, the precondition was that he could get used to the speed!

Two hours later. Even though he fell over and over again, the distance between Yang Ye and the white haired woman grew shorter and shorter. However, the consumption of profound energy to fly with a sword caused Yang Ye to be unable to help but feel slightly ashamed because if he hadn’t been absorbing the energy within energy stones at all times, then his profound energy would have probably been completely exhausted a long time ago!

Suddenly, the white haired woman stopped. She turned around and gazed at Yang Ye who stood on the sword and was on the verge of falling, and then a strand of surprise and curiosity flashed in her eyes!

Once Yang Ye approached and stopped in front of her, she said, “Your method of controlling a sword to fly is extremely ingenious. It seems to be controlled by the heart?”

Yang Ye took a deep breath of air, and then he nodded and said, “Indeed!”

The woman nodded, and then she glanced at Yang Ye and said, “Your strength isn’t bad, but you shouldn’t follow me. The Nether God’s Tomb is in the distance, and the cold wind there will grow stronger and stronger. Your soul can’t endure the assault of the cold wind there. Moreover, there should be numerous fellows from the nether territory over there, and they’ll act against you if they notice you!”

“Are you not afraid of them?” asked Yang Ye. “Their attacks are very bizarre and impossible to guard against!”

The woman shook her head and said, “They can’t defeat me!”

Yang Ye was speechless.

The white haired woman glanced at Yang Ye, and then she turned around with the intention of leaving. Yang Ye hurriedly said, “Can we travel together? As you know, it’s my first time here, and it’ll be extremely dangerous if I move about at random!”

“You’re slightly weak!” The white haired woman said frankly, “Even I will be unable to save you if we encounter those fellows from the nether territory. So, go back to Ancient Domain City! Otherwise, find a few human profounders to form a group with them!”

Yang Ye’s face darkened. Am I weak? Fine, I really am weak in the eyes of many! But I’m absolutely not weak amongst my peers. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

However, the woman before him had called him weak, and Yang Ye really had the urge to ask her for a one on one battle! But the displeasure in his heart had instantly vanished when he heard the last few sentences that she spoke.

He felt that while she possessed a formidable strength and was slightly slow-witted, she was a good person in heart.

Yang Ye was about to say something. Suddenly, the woman frowned, and then a bright and cold glow flashed.

Clang!

A clear and melodious sound of metal breaking resounded. Three golden needles that were fine like hair fell to the ground in front of Yang Ye.

Yang Ye’s face sank as he gazed at the golden needles, and then he turned to gaze at a bald man and an extremely gorgeous woman that had suddenly appeared at the side.

“Xiao Yuxi, you’ve spoiled my plans again!” The bale man gazed at the white haired woman and spoke with a gloomy expression.

The white haired woman said, “Mo Kuang, we’re all humans. There’s no need to do that.”

“Mind your own business!” The gorgeous woman by Mo Kuang’s side suddenly spoke in a sharp voice. “Xiao Yuxi, your Xiao Clan and my Mo Clan have always avoided interfering with each other’s business, but you’ve repeatedly obstructed us after coming to the Ancient Battlefield. What exactly is the meaning of this?”

The white haired woman glanced at the two of them, and then she pondered deeply for a short while before she said, “If the two of you want to kill me, then why look for such pointless excuses? You’ve already recruited some help, so just ask them to show themselves!”

“Haha!!” Right at this moment, roaring laughter suddenly resounded before a young man who held a long saber in his hand appeared mysteriously. The young man sized Xiao Yuxi up before he said, “As expected of someone from the Xiao Clan. Looks like you noticed us a long time ago. Eccentric Du! Bloodless Death! There’s no need to hide anymore!”

As soon as he finished speaking, a man in green robes and a man in black robed appeared behind the white haired woman. The green robed man sized her up while a strand of a lustful glow erupted from within his eyes. He said, “Tsk, tsk. You’re truly a divine figure. Siblings of the Mo Clan, we’ve agreed upon it. Her corpse belongs to me. Haha!!”

“The Swift Saber, Bai Feng, the Amorous Doctor of Poisons, Eccentric Du, and the Sword That Leaves No Blood, Bloodless Death....” Xiao Yuxi glanced at the three of them before she said, “I never expected that they would even get the three of you.”

The reputation of these three fellows could be said to be on par with the three outstanding geniuses of the central territory, but it was a bad reputation!

While he was at the seventh rank of the King Realm, the Swift Saber Bai Feng had once made a Spirit Realm expert unable to fight back against him and tortured that Spirit Realm expert to death by constantly executing a thousand slashes in every single breath of time! Since that battle came to an end, Bai Feng attained the reputation of being the Swift Saber! Not to mention personally experiencing it, even hearing about such speed was astounding!

The Doctor of Poison, Eccentric Du, could be said to be infamous because he specialized in playing with women, and they weren’t even living women! They were dead! His strength wasn’t especially formidable, but his mysterious and undetectable poison techniques caused others to shudder in horror from just hearing about it! In the past, a City Governor had issued a warrant for his death because he’d killed and played with that City Governor’s concubine. In his rage, he poisoned the entire population of over a million in the city!

Since then, he vanished from the view of the public, and he hadn’t made another appearance. Of course, he didn’t want to vanish, but some extraordinary experts had been infuriated by his actions, and they took joint action to pursue him. So, he had no choice but to vanish!

As for Bloodless Death, he was an assassin. He could be said to be a legend in the world of assassins! Because he only assassinated targets who were above his realm of cultivation. In other words, he only accepted missions with targets that possessed a cultivation that was a realm above his own! According to incomplete statistics, he’d assassinated over 100 Spirit Realm experts while at the King Realm!

But this time, he’d come to assassinate Xiao Yuxi who was at the same realm of cultivation as himself....

Xiao Yuxi’s expression was solemn because the strength of her opponents was extremely formidable, and they were even very large in number. On the other hand, Yang Ye was extremely calm because he didn’t know them at all! Of course, he wouldn’t be afraid even if he did!

“I’m really curious. Exactly what price did they pay to actually be able to recruit the three of you!” said Xiao Yuxi.

“It’s naturally something that we desire!” Bai Feng laughed coldly and said, “Maiden Xiao, everyone says that you’re the future Saber Exalt of the continent, and I’m very disgruntled by that. So, I’ve wanted to fight you for a long time and see who exactly is the future Saber Exalt. Now, I finally have the chance!”

“Bai Feng, I didn’t hire you to compete for a title with her!” Meanwhile, Mo Kuang spoke in a low voice. “I know you’re proud and think that your saber technique is inferior to no one. However, I have to tell you that her Saber Intent was already at the peak of the 6th level a year ago. Otherwise, would I pay such a huge price to hire the three of you!?”

The expressions of everyone in the surroundings changed when they heard Mo Kuang. Even Yang Ye’s was shocked as well! This seemingly slow-witted woman is actually so formidable? Her Saber Intent was at the peak of the 6th level a year ago?

When he thought up to here, Yang Ye felt slightly embarrassed. No wonder she said I’m slightly weak just now. So, she wasn’t speaking recklessly. She had the right to say that!
