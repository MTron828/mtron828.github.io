Chapter 1925 – Sky Gate!

Human!

In order to avoid unnecessary trouble, he’d concealed his aura upon entering this place. However, he hadn’t expected to still be discovered.

Yang Ye stood up and turned around. There was a young man and woman not too far away from him.

The young man wore a yellow robe that had a ferocious beast embroidered on it; the women wore a dress that had nothing striking about it. If it wasn’t for the unknown flower tattooed on her face, she would look like a human!

Both of them possessed extraordinary strength at the 2nd stage of the Enlightened Realm!

The young man asked again, “You’re human?”

Yang Ye didn’t hide it and nodded.

The young man’s eyes narrowed slightly, “How dare you sneak into the royal palace. You…”

Yang Ye suddenly said, “I came here with Yin Hou!” He had to use her name now. Otherwise, trouble would definitely come for him.

Yin Hou? The young man frowned, “Why would Senior Yin Hou bring you here?!”

Yang Ye shrugged, “Why don’t you ask here once she comes out?”

The young man’s frown deepened, “I’m asking you!”

Yang Ye frowned as well, “Didn’t you hear me?”

The young man’s face fell, “Do you know who you’re talking to?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “I don’t, and I don’t want to know!”

The woman by the young man’s side intended to speak, but the man stopped her and walked over to Yang Ye, “I’ll ask you one last time. Why did Senior Yin Hou bring a human like you here?”

Yang Ye looked the young man in the eyes, “There’s a reason, of course. However, I don’t want to tell you. Understand?”

Yang Ye hated people assuming a position of superiority and questioning him like he was below them. As far as he was concerned, respect was a two way street. If someone spoke nicely to him, he would speak nicely to the person; if someone didn’t speak nicely to him, neither would he!

The young man’s face instantly turned gloomy, “Guards!”

As soon as he called for them, three armored guards appeared by his side. The young man gazed at Yang Ye, “He’s a human! Are all of you blind? You let a human enter the royal palace?”

One of the guards hesitated for a moment and said, “Your Highness, he came here with Yin Hou!”

Yin Hou!

The young man gazed at Yang Ye, and Yang Ye shrugged, “See? I didn’t lie to you.”

The young man spoke in a low voice, “Capture him first. I’ll deal with Yin Hou!”

However, the guards didn’t move at all.

The young man was infuriated by this, “What? You intend to go against me?”

“We dare not!” The guard who led the group cupped his fist to the young man and said, “Your Highness, since he arrived here with Yin Hou, it represents that Lady Yin Hou has a reason for bringing him here. Unless she gives the order, we dare not act arbitrarily. Your Highness, please forgive us!”

The young man spoke angrily, “Is she greater than my father?”

The guard suddenly said, “The Shaman Emperor has not given us any orders!”

The young man was exasperated when he heard this. He glared angrily at the guard, “How dare you! What are you trying to say?!”

The guard cupped his fist to the young man, “I didn’t say that with any ill intent!”

The young man was about to speak when the guard suddenly turned around and took a knee, “Lady Yin Hou!”

The young man’s figure stiffened. He turned around, and he saw a woman looking at him.

It was Yin Hou.

The young man hesitated for a moment and bowed, “Lady Yin Hou!”

Yin Hou withdrew her gaze and looked at the guard, “You can leave!”

The guard cupped his fist and vanished with the other two guards.

Yin Hou gazed at the young man, “Li Jiang, you have quite the temper!”

The expression of the young man, Li Jiang, changed when he heard this, and he hurriedly bowed, “I dare not.”

Yin Hou said, “Your father asked me to take both your sister and you to the Sky Dimension, and I agreed to do that. But now it seems like…”

Thump!

Li Jiang suddenly knelt on the ground and spoke in a trembling voice, “Lady Yin Hou, it was my mistake. Please forgive my offense!”

The woman knelt down as well, “Please forgive us!”

Yin Hou didn’t look at them, and she looked at Yang Ye instead, “What do you think?”

She’s asking me? Yang Ye was slightly stunned, and he said, “If they’re not allowed to go to the Sky Dimension, are the consequences serious?

Yin Hou replied, “The Shaman Emperor has seven sons, and all of them desire to go. Because going represents some things!”

“Then it’s very important!” Yang Ye smiled, “Senior, let’s just forget it. It was nothing!”

A trace of admiration flashed through her eyes, “You know when to take a step back even at your age, and there’s kindness in your heart. Not bad!”

Knowing when to take a step back and kindness…

Yang Ye rubbed his nose while a slightly strange expression appeared on his face.

Hou Qing shook his head in the pagoda as well. He was very well aware that Yang Ye wasn’t pursuing the matter because they hadn’t exceeded his limits. If they had, then Yin Hou would know how crazy the young man before her was!

Meanwhile, Li Jiang and the woman were visibly relieved when they heard Yang Ye. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Yin Hou said, “Stand!”

Only then did Li Jiang and the woman stand up.

Meanwhile, a black shadow descended from the sky, and a woman appeared there.

Yang Ye was stunned when he saw her because he’d met her before. She was the woman from the shaman race who’d attacked Nansi Yin and him. Right, Snowy had tried to take her snake!

She was slightly surprised to see Yang Ye as well, and then she nodded slightly.

Yin Hou sized up the woman and said, “Li Wu, you’re really not bad!”

Li Wu bowed slightly to Yin Hou, and then she moved aside and fell silent.

Yin Hou said, “Going with me to the Sky Dimension means that you’ll be representing the shaman race. No matter what, don’t allow our shaman race to lose face. In short, keep a low profile when you should, and make a show of strength when needed. Don’t shrink back, understand?”

They hurriedly nodded. It was related to the shaman race’s honor, so they naturally had to take it seriously!

Yin Hou waved her right hand. In an instant, a speck of black light appeared far away in the sky. It grew larger rapidly. In the end, a black roc that was around 300m long appeared above them.

“Let’s go!” As soon as she said that, she waved her right hand. The others felt the scene before their eyes changed, and then they were on the roc. There were two other old men on the roc. They bowed slightly to Yin Hou and moved aside.

Yin Hou nodded slightly and tapped her right foot down. A moment later, the roc’s huge wings flapped and vanished into the sky.

The roc flew swiftly through the clouds, and it was very much faster than Yang Ye’s speed on his sword.

Yang Ye sat down cross-legged and immersed his consciousness into his body.

Yang Ye asked, “Senior, is a Shaman King’s status very high in the shaman race?”

“Obviously!” Hou Qing continued, “The 12 Shaman Kings of the shaman race possess extraordinary status. It can be said that only the Shaman Progenitor can truly command us. Even the Shaman Emperor doesn’t have the right to command us! So, the 12 Shaman Kings are like pillars of support for the shaman race. If that kid encountered a Shaman King with a bad temper just now, his future would be over. Because one had to gain the support and acknowledgement of all 12 Shaman Kings to become the Shaman Emperor, and only the Shaman Emperor can tell Shaman Kings to do certain things.”

Shaman Kings!

Yang Ye nodded slightly and returned his consciousness to the outside world. He walked over to Yin Hou and asked, “Senior, how long will it take to get there?”

She gazed at him, “Why do you so desperately desire to go there?”

Yang Ye replied, “I have a friend there. I want to go get her.”

In the Sky Dimension? Yin Hou frowned slightly. A short while passed before she asked, “You’re from the lower dimension, so how did you offend the Sovereign of Man and the Shaman Hunter Clan?”

Yang Ye glanced at her, “You know everything?”

She replied, “I did my research!”

He smiled, “It’s a long story.”

Yin Hou said, “Both the Sovereign of Man and the Shaman Hunter Clan aren’t ordinary, but you’ve offended them both. If you return to the Human Dimension, you’ll probably have to suffer. So, stay in the Shaman Dimension!”

Stay? Yang Ye was slightly stunned, and then he smiled, “I don’t know where I’ll be going, but I’ll take it one step at a time!”

Yin Hou nodded slightly, “In short, if you don’t want to head back to the Human Dimension, then stay. You’re his disciple, so while he isn’t here, no one in the Shaman Dimension will dare to harm you!”

Yang Ye smiled and remained silent. He was bound to never have any peace in the near future.

He had to get Zi’er back then revive Blood Maiden.

In short, he had a lot of troublesome things to deal with!

Suddenly, Yin Hou looked towards the distance, “We’re here!”

Everyone looked up, and so did Yang Ye. There was a huge white jade door at the end of the sky.

“The Sky Gate!” Yin Hou said, “We’ll be in the Sky Dimension once we pass through.”

She tapped her right foot down, and the roc sped up.

Yang Ye took a deep breath and clenched his fists!

The Sky Dimension! Xiao Qi! Zi’er!
