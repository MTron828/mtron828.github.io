Chapter 358 – Come At Me!

Under the myriad of gazes of anticipation that were coming from the surroundings, a woman in a green dress had slowly appeared within everyone’s fields of vision. She had a single arm, and she held a black ancient sheathe in her left hand.

Yang Ye’s brows knit together tightly upon seeing her because it was none other than Mo Qingyu who he’s chopped an arm off from on that day. He hadn’t expected that she’d actually become the Sword Emperor. His gaze descended onto the ancient sheathe in her hand, and then his heart shook. That’s probably the mysterious ancient sheathe that Elder Mu spoke about!Mo Qingyu’s gaze descended onto Yang Ye, and then she slowly walked over towards him. As she walked towards him, the swords throughout the surroundings started to tremble even more violently, and it was like they’d encountered some sort of terrifying thing!

“According to the rumors, the sword can’t be utilized in front of the Sword Emperor. Looks like this rumor is true!” Luo Xue watched this scene from somewhere within the city, and he chuckled before he glanced at Yang Ye and said, “An extraordinary genius in the Sword Dao against the Sword Emperor. Haha! It’s really getting more and more interesting!”

Mo Ke and Hun You didn’t choose to attack because they wanted to see how Yang Ye would deal with the Sword Emperor.

“Do you still remember....” Mo Qingyu walked towards Yang Ye as she said, “That I said I would repay you a hundredfold for severing my arm?”

Before Yang Ye could answer, she continued. “I was careless that day, and it allowed you to sever my arm from a surprise attack with a Natural Treasure. That’s the greatest humiliation in my entire lifetime. However, I have to thank you because it allowed me to be reborn and attain the 8th level of Sword Intent. That was what gave me the chance to head to Sword Emperor Mountain and obtain the acknowledgment of the ancient sheathe!”

“And then, you came to look for me?” Yang Ye smiled while his eyes didn’t reveal even a shred of fear.

“Yes!” Mo Qingyu nodded and said, “You severed my arm that day, so I’ll sever all your limbs today. What do you think?”

Yang Ye shrugged and said, “Then what are you waiting for? It just so happens that I want to see exactly how formidable the so-called Sword Emperor is!”

“As you wish!” As soon as she spoke, Mo Qingyu’s wrist shook slightly, and then a ray of green light flashed out from the ancient sheathe.

In the next moment, Yang Ye’s pupils constricted violently because a hole had appeared on his left shoulder. The hole was a few centimeters deep, and if it wasn’t for his formidable physical defense, then just this attack alone would have probably caused his left arm to be severed from his body!

So this is the might of her 8th level Sword Intent, Wind Intent, and the ancient sheathe? If she merely possessed 8th level Sword Intent and Wind Intent, then it would be absolutely impossible for him to suffer this strike without being able to react at all! In other words, the ancient sheathe had definitely provided some sort of assistance!

Mo Qingyu frowned and said, “I never expected that your physical body had actually attained such a level. How surprising! However, it’s fine as well. This will make it even more interesting!”

As soon as she finished speaking, another ray of green light flashed. Right when it was about to come into contact with Yang Ye’s left knee, a ray of violet light flashed and struck the ray of green light, causing both to instantly disperse into the air!

“Hmm?” Mo Qingyu exclaimed lightly with surprise and said, “You’re actually able to block it!” Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“Haha!!” Yang Ye roared with laughter. He laughed for a short while before he shook his head and said, “Mo Qingyu, it looks like your confidence has really swelled to an impossible height upon becoming the so-called Sword Emperor!”

He wasn’t able to react to it on the first time because he wasn’t on guard against it, and he’d been taken by surprise. The reason he was able to block it on the second time was naturally because he’d utilized the Enlightened Sword Heart and Sword Domain. While it was beneath his Sword Domain, he would be able to block her attack even if her attacks were 10 times faster!

“You’ve really surprised me!” Mo Qingyu said, “Even a Spirit Realm expert wouldn’t be able to block an attack enhanced by 8th level Sword Intent and 8th level Wind Intent, yet you were able to accomplish it with ease. Looks like I’ve been underestimating you since the beginning!”

Yang Ye laughed coldly. He couldn’t be bothered to waste his breath on her. He tightened his grasp on his sword before a ray of violet light shot forward explosively.

A wisp of ridicule arose on the corners of Mo Qingyu’s mouth when she saw Yang Ye attack. She didn’t take any action, and she just stood there and allowed Yang Ye’s sword qi to arrive in front of her!

Right when it around 1m away from here, the ancient sheathe in her grasp had suddenly trembled lightly, and then Yang Ye’s sword qi was directly absorbed by it under the astounded and puzzled gazes of everyone in the surroundings. After that, there was no further sign of Yang Ye’s attack....

A solemn expression appeared in Yang Ye’s eyes because the ancient sheathe was even more mysterious and shocking than he’d imagined! It was actually able to absorb sword qi!

“Utilizing the sword before the Sword Emperor is truly stupid beyond compare!” Meanwhile, Hun You who was watching the battle from the side had suddenly said, “Yang Ye, don’t you know that the ancient sheathe is extremely deterring towards sword cultivators? No matter if it’s the sword, sword qi, or even sword techniques, they’ll be forcefully suppressed in front of the ancient sheathe. All swords submit before the Sword Emperor! Did you think it was a joke?”

Yang Ye glanced indifferently at Hun You and said, “This is a matter between humans. What does it have to do with someone like you who’s neither man nor monster?”

“You’re courting death!” Hun You was furious, and he was about to attack. However, Mo Qingyu suddenly said, “He’s mine. I’ll kill anyone who touches him!” As soon as she finished speaking, she glanced coldly at Hun You.

“Do you think I’m afraid of you?” Hun You laughed coldly and said, “Even though Yang Ye isn’t really a great person, I have to say that his words from before really make sense. Do you really think you’re invincible just because you’ve become the Sword Emperor? Do you think you’re the Sword Sect’s Founding Ancestor from all those years ago?”

“Why don’t you give it a try?” Mo Qingyu spoke in a cold voice.

Hun You was about to attack when Mo Ke stopped him. Mo Ke shook his head and said, “This is a battle between sword cultivators. We don’t have to interfere. Even I’m able to restrain myself, could it be that you can’t?”

Hun You was still displeased. However, he didn’t try to attack again, and he just glanced coldly at Yang Ye and Mo Qingyu.

“You still intend to fight? I’ll let you attack three times! Otherwise, you might not have the chance to attack.” Mo Qingyu spoke indifferently as she gazed at Yang Ye.

Yang Ye nodded, and then he took a deep breath. Needless to say, the ancient sheathe was truly extremely abnormal. Because anything related to the sword seemed to be unable to do anything to Mo Qingyu. Moreover, he was able to sense that his sword had completely lost its aura when facing the ancient sheathe, and it actually had the intent to submit. At the same time that he felt aggrieved by this, Yang Ye felt quite helpless as well!

Fortunately, the Sword Domain seemed to remain unaffected by it!

Yang Ye didn’t speak further and strode slowly towards Mo Qingyu. When he arrived around 30m in front of Mo Qingyu, Yang Ye slowly closed his eyes.

Right when he was about to utilize the Sword Domain, a strand of roaring laughter had suddenly resounded from the horizon. Yang Ye frowned and raised his head to look over, and he saw an enormous golden dragon formed from energy was swimming over from the distant horizon!

Bang!

The golden dragon crashed to the ground and dispersed, and then a man in a golden robe appeared before everyone. It was none other than Mu Jun whom Yang Ye had fought with on that day!

Mu Jun held the golden dragon seal in his hand while he glanced at Mo Qingyu, and then a wisp of a solemn expression flashed through his eyes upon noticing the ancient sheathe in her hand. After that, he turned to look at Yang Ye and said, “We hadn’t decided on a victor in the battle that day. How about we have a fight today?”

Meanwhile, Mo Qingyu said in a low voice, “His life is mine!”

Mu Jun laughed coldly and said, “But you weren’t able to kill him, right? So, allow me to take his life instead, alright?”

“No!” Mo Qingyu refused and said, “I’d said that I would make him pay a hundredfold for severing my arm, so how could I go back on my word? Moreover, this is a battle between sword cultivators, so you shouldn’t interfere!”

Mu Jun frowned when he heard this. Right when he was about to say something, Mo Ke had suddenly spoken from the side. “Humans always love to waste their breath. Are all of you going to kill him or not? I’ll do it myself if the two of you aren’t doing it, and you can just watch from the side, alright?”

“Hehe....” Hun You laughed gloomily and said, “Why don’t you allow me to do it? After all, the soul of a sword cultivator is extremely nourishing. It’s rare to come by in a hundred years!”

“All of you don’t have to fight!” Right at this moment, Yang Ye had suddenly spoken.

“Oh?” Mu Jun’s brows raised, and he said, “What?”

Yang Ye paid no attention to Mu Jun. He turned around to gaze at the profounders from the southern territory who were standing behind him, and he said, “All of you return to the city!”

Even though most of them possessed fairly good strengths, they would only be giving their lives away by staying here, and it was completely meaningless!

“We refuse to leave!” All of them shook their heads and had firm expressions in their hearts.

Yang Ye’s heart felt warm as he chuckled lightly and said, “You’ll only be distractions to me by staying here. Returning to the city is the greatest help you can give me. Understand?”

All of them fell silent. Even though they didn’t want to leave, they had to admit that they would only burden Yang Ye by staying. But they really didn’t want to leave right now!

Most of them were loyal. Because Yang Ye had disregarded the threat Mo Ke and the others from the devil race had posed to him in order to rescue them, so how could they not be moved by this? Moreover, the profounders from the southern territory hadn’t just offended the members of the devil race, nether race, and demon race; they’d offended the experts of the other territories as well. If they didn’t hold tightly onto someone like Yang Ye for support, then it would still be death that awaited them!

“Go back!” Yang Ye spoke once more.

All of them exchanged glances before they bowed to Yang Ye. One of them said, “Yang Ye, you must survive. We’ll be awaiting your safe return within the city. If you die, then we brothers will definitely try our best to kill the profounders of the devil race until all of us perish!”

As soon as he finished speaking, they stopped hesitating and returned to the city.

Mo Ke, Mo Qingyu, and the others watched coldly as this happened, and they didn’t stop those profounders from leaving. Indeed, they only had a single objective right now, and it was Yang Ye. As for those small fries, they really didn’t feel like paying any attention to them.

After those profounders from the southern territory had gone back into the city, Yang Ye took a deep breath before he turned around. His gaze swept past Mo Ke, Hun You, Mu Jun, and Mo Qingyu before a savage expression suddenly appeared on his face. He said, “All of you don’t have to fight, and you can just come at me together!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye’s figure flashed, and he arrived with 30m of them. After that, a strand of flame suddenly appeared and the temperature in the surroundings instantly became burning.

At the same time, 200 swords shot into the sky while strands of flame instantly attached themselves to those swords....

In an instant, the expressions of everyone in the surroundings had changed!
