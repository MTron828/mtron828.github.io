Chapter 2047 – Come Look for Me if You’re Unhappy!

Someone with the Yang surname!

Yang Ye was stunned and asked, “What do you mean?”

The middle aged man glanced at Yang Ye and said, “I don’t know. Kid, that place isn’t an ordinary place. Do you know who its students are? They are the monstrous geniuses of the four clans, and the best geniuses from all the other races.”

He paused for a moment and continued, “It can be considered as the number one academy in the large world. The ancestors of all the Paths, like that existence from the Dao Path and my Weapon Path are Honorary Elders there.”

Yang Ye spoke in a low voice, “It’s that great?”

“Great?” The middle aged man chuckled, “Martial Emperor Academy isn’t just great, the truly formidable part about it is that the patriarchs of all the four clans take the initiative to become friends with it. There are many reasons like the academy is always neutral and doesn’t interfere in any fights. Of course, it’s mainly because they have Originite.”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Originite? What’s that?”

The middle aged man asked, “You should know about the god race, right?”

Yang Ye nodded.

The middle aged man added, “But do you know what race existed before the god race?”

Yang Ye frowned slightly, “What do you mean?”

The middle aged man explained, “Besides the god race, all the other races and clans practically know nothing about the history before the god race. No records exist. Even the god race probably doesn’t have many records about.”

Yang Ye asked, “What does that have to do with the Martial Emperor Academy?”

The middle aged man explained, “Because Martial Emperor Academy has Originite. Originite is a type of rock that contains records of the civilization before our current known history. Some special rocks are innately capable of recording images. Some powerful experts of the prehistoric civilization had images of them cultivating or fighting recorded in these rocks, and these rocks have been preserved until now. Understand?”

Yang Ye frowned, “Are those experts very strong?”

The middle aged man nodded, “Extremely strong. The prehistoric civilization was much more advanced than us, and it’s a conclusion that the four clans gained after studying one of the Originite!”

Yang Ye spoke in a low voice, “If they were so strong, why did they vanish? Moreover, they vanished without a trace!”

The middle aged man rolled his eyes, “Who am I to ask for an answer to that? Regardless of whether they were annihilated or went to another universe, that has nothing to do with us. The reason I want you to go to Martial Emperor Academy… To be honest, I’m doing it for you.”

“For me?” Yang Ye glanced at him with a slightly weird expression in his eyes.

The middle aged man spoke angrily, “What’s with that look? Kid, you have too much karma coiled around you. You’ve been swept into my Weapon Path, the Dao Path, and all sorts of other things. To be honest, once it’s time to resolve those strings of karma, even I’m not confident in being able to keep you alive. But if you go to the Martial Emperor Academy and get a good position there, then you’ll have a better chance at surviving once you have them to rely on.”

Yang Ye spoke in a low voice, “Senior, have you found out something?”

The middle aged man nodded, “To be honest, I slightly regret asking you to do all of this. According to my knowledge, it isn’t just members of my Weapon Path that want to kill you, even the Buddhist Path and Dao Path have existences who want to kill you. However, they dare not act rashly right now. All of them are watching, watching the person standing behind you!”

“The person standing behind me?” Yang Ye was stunned and asked, “I have someone? Who? Why don’t I know about it?”

The middle aged man spoke indifferently, “If there wasn’t someone, you would have died a hundred times by now. Forget that, I want you to go to the Martial Emperor Academy for two reasons. Firstly, I hope that you’ll represent my Slaughter Line to get a Originite for my Weapon Path. If you’re able to do that and contribute it to the Weapon Path, then our ancestor will be forced to owe you a favor.”

The middle aged man’s expression became serious at this point, “If you’re able to make our ancestor owe you a favor, it’ll be very beneficial for your future. I’m serious!”

Yang Ye remained silent.

Meanwhile, the middle aged man added, “There’s one more thing. You’re truly entered into the gazes of many people. In the past, you were amongst the other races, and you hadn’t entered our circle. So, no matter how strong you were, you were an outsider to us. Yet now, you are part of this circle, and the gazes of even more have descended upon you. It’s a good thing, and a bad thing. The good part is that some may choose to invest in you, and the bad is that some will try to kill you!”

Yang Ye shook his head, “It’s so complicated!”

The middle aged man nodded, “I don’t like complicated things too. However, it can’t be helped. We can’t avoid some things.”

He paused for a moment and continued, “One last thing. You know Elder Yuan, right?”

Yang Ye nodded, “I do.”

The middle aged man said, “Being more respectful to him isn’t a bad thing for you. Understand?”

Yang Ye asked, “Who is he?”

The middle aged man shook his head, “I don’t know the answer either. In any case, he was in the Slaughter Line when I arrived here. Perhaps our ancestor is the only one in the Weapon Path who knows about his background. In any case, no matter who he is, he should have no ill intent towards you.”

Yang Ye nodded, “I understand!”

The middle aged man said, “The admission letter contains the location of Martial Emperor Academy. There’s only a month left before classes start, so keep a low profile and avoid causing trouble until then!”

Yang Ye suddenly asked, “What if someone offends me?”

The middle aged man replied indifferently, “What’s your sword for? I dare not guarantee anything else, but I dare guarantee that if anyone kills you in the Weapon Dimension, I’ll definitely avenge you, no matter who that person is. Of course, besides our ancestor. After all, I’m not a match for him.”

Yang Ye asked, “Can you not wait until I’m dead? Can’t you help before I die?”

The middle aged man said, “I said IF! In short, just be careful!”

The middle aged man vanished from the hall.

Yang Ye fell silent for a long time before he spoke softly, “Martial Emperor Academy… The Yang surname…”

Meanwhile, Elder Yuan appeared in Gracious Hall.

Elder Yuan asked, “He’s gone?”

Yang Ye nodded and gazed at Elder Yuan. The latter said, “He’s one of the few geniuses in the Weapon Path’s history. Unfortunately, his heart has never been in the Weapon Path. Otherwise, he would have been the Seal Master of the Slaughter Line, and if he was the Seal Master, the Slaughter Line wouldn’t have fallen to its current state.”

He gazed at Yang Ye and continued, “Actually, you’re not bad too. You’re a very decisive and opinionated person. I like people like you. But…”

Yang Ye unconsciously asked, “But what?”

The old man shook his head slightly, “But you’re a little too extreme. An extreme character causes you to make countless enemies!”

Yang Ye smiled, “Senior, is there a perfect person in this world?”

The old man shook his head.

Yang Ye chuckled, “See? There’s no perfect person.”

The old man glanced at Yang Ye and nodded, “You have that young man’s talisman?”

Yang Ye replied, “I do!”

The old man said, “Give it to me, alright?” He stared at Yang Ye while he spoke.

Yang Ye smiled, “Alright!”

Yang Ye flicked his finger, and the talisman was immediately withdrawn from the Primordial Pagoda and descended before the old man. Once it appeared there, it intended to fly off, but the old man tapped it lightly, and it immediately fell silent.

The old man gazed at the talisman and said, “If you showed even the slightest hesitance, I wouldn’t have taken it from you. But you’ve surprised me.”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “What do you mean?”

The old man said, “It belongs to someone of rather high status in the Prediction Line. So, it’ll only bring calamity to you if you keep it. Perhaps you’re not afraid of it, but if that person suddenly attacks you, then unless that kid’s main body comes to your aid, you’ll probably die.”

That kid! Yang Ye was stunned. But it didn’t take long for him to come to an understanding and realize that the old man was speaking about the Young Martial Uncle!

Elder Yuan actually addressed him as ‘kid’.

Meanwhile, Elder Yuan added, “I’ll keep it for you, and I’ll return it to you once he’s gone!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he turned around and left.

Yang Ye suddenly asked, “Why are you helping me?”

The old man stopped and said, “There aren’t many left that are pleasing to the eye for me.”

He vanished from the hall once he finished speaking.

Yang Ye remained silent.

Around 15 minutes later, a middle aged man suddenly appeared at the training grounds.

A Half-Step Sage Realm expert!

The middle aged man looked up and gazed in the direction of Gracious Palace, and then he stretched out his right hand. He was about to attack when an old man suddenly appeared in front of him.

The old man raised his hand, and the talisman appeared in his grasp, “It’s with me.”

The middle aged man gazed at the old man, “Are you going to return it?”

The old man shook his head. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

The middle aged man nodded, “They say you’re the most mysterious person in my Weapon Dimension. Today, I’d like to see how mysterious you are…”

Suddenly, the middle aged man’s voice stopped abruptly!

The old man had suddenly appeared in front of him and was just a step away from him. However, he’d actually not noticed how the old man appeared before him!

The old man gazed at the middle aged man and said, “Based on your aura, it’ll take a year at most for you to attain the Sage Realm. I’m going to interfere in this today, so if you’re unhappy, come back again a year from now!”

As soon as he finished speaking, the old man suddenly waved his right hand.

Bang!

The middle aged man was blasted away, and he flew over 10,000km away from Gracious Mountain!
