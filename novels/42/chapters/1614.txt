Chapter 1615 - Milky Way System!

Translator: InVader

Needless to say, Yang Ye was quite stunned because he hadn’t expected the man to act so overbearingly.

He was just asking for direction!

Yang Ye didn’t give it further thought because the armored man’s palm was right above his head. The man hadn’t held back at all. So, if it struck him, then he would be crippled even if he survived. His current body wasn’t being enhanced by the energy of the Demon God, so it couldn’t resist the strength of Rebirth Realm experts.

Yang Ye didn’t use his sword. He just clenched his right fist and slammed it at the armored man’s palm.

Elemental Breaker combined with the ability to rebound energy!

Yang Ye hadn’t held back as well!

Boom!

As soon as their attacks collided, the armored man’s expression changed drastically, and then…

Crack!

The armored man’s right hand flew into the air while accompanied by a string of blood. It wasn’t just his right hand, even his entire figure was blasted away. However, it didn’t take long for him to stop, and then a spear appeared in his left grasp before he stabbed it forward.

The armored man wasn’t counter-attacking but defending himself. Because while his figure was blasted away, Yang Ye had appeared in front of him.

Yang Ye’s expression remained calm as he watched the spear shoot towards him, and he swung his fist again!

Bang!

The spear shattered into bits. At the same time, the middle aged man had let go of the spear and moved around 1km to the left.

Yang Ye didn’t continue attacking. He glanced at the middle aged man instead. Needless to say, he was quite surprised by the middle aged man’s strength. He’d caught the middle aged man off guard and heavily injured the man, so he thought that he could seize the opportunity it created to capture the middle aged man. However, he hadn’t expected the middle aged man to remain calm while being pushed back and even be able to react quickly.

Obviously, the middle aged man wasn’t the kind of Rebirth Realm expert that was just nurtured at home, and he was the type that had experienced numerous battles!

Meanwhile, the armored man glanced at the injury on his right shoulder, and then he gazed at Yang Ye. A solemn expression filled his eyes.

“Who are…” The man was about to say something, but his expression changed drastically, and he intended to leave the spot he stood on. However, it was too late. Yang Ye had suddenly appeared behind him, and Yang Ye’s hand had clamped down onto his throat.

Yang Ye just had to squeeze a little and his neck would be broken!

“You…” Yang Ye was about to speak when his expression suddenly changed, and then he vanished on the spot. He was 30km away when his figure appeared again.

Once Yang Ye left the area behind the armored man, the latter’s body exploded apart, and then a wave of terrifying energy swept towards the surroundings. In an instant, the starry sky here shook violently and seemed to be on the verge of collapse!

Self-detonation!

The armored man had chosen to detonate himself once Yang Ye restrained him!

How terrifying was the self-detonation of a Rebirth Realm expert? That expanse of the starry sky surged and rippled for almost 15 minutes before it finally calmed down. That was even after Yang Ye had made efforts to calm it down. Otherwise, it would probably take a day to calm down completely. Or it should be said that it might have collapsed from the impact.

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed while a trace of bewilderment appeared in them. After all, he’d just wanted to ask for directions, so he felt like it wasn’t necessary to act so resolutely and ruthlessly!

Suddenly, Yang Ye turned to look not too far ahead of himself. The space there shook, and then five men in golden armor appeared in front of him. All of them had a tiny ‘杨’ character embroidered on their left chests.

All five of them were Rebirth Realm experts!

Yang Ye sized up the five of them and said, “I think that there’s definitely a misunderstanding. I’m just passing by.”

Yang Ye wasn’t joking. He really felt that there was a misunderstanding. Because it was very strange for the armored man to suddenly attack him just now. After all, how could anyone at the Rebirth Realm be stupid?

There was definitely a reason why the middle aged man had attacked, and he just wasn’t aware of the reason.

The armored man who led the group stepped forward, sized up Yang Ye, and said, “I sense a familiar bloodline coming from you. You’re a member of the Yang Clan?”

The Yang Clan? Yang Ye frowned slightly. Suddenly, his gaze descended onto the small ‘杨’ character on their left chests which represented the surname of the Yang Clan, “All of you are from the Yang Clan as well?”

His eyes instantly narrowed slightly when they heard Yang Ye. He sized up Yang Ye and said, “I’ve met all the young masters, so you aren’t one of them… Which young master do you serve?!” Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Yang Ye glanced at them and replied, “Yang Yan!”

They were stunned when they heard Yang Ye, and then they exchanged glances. In the end, the armored man who led the group spoke, “Young Master Yang Yan?”

Yang Ye nodded.

The armored man pondered deeply for a moment, and then he smiled, “So you serve Young Master Yang Yan, I’m sorry for the offense. It was a complete misunderstanding.” He paused for a moment, and then he asked, “May I know what you’re doing here?”

Yang Ye pondered deeply for a moment and replied, “He asked me to come here and have a look.”

They exchanged glances and fell silent.

Something worth mentioning was that they’d clenched their fists.

Yang Ye glanced at their tightly clenched fists and said, “You intend to kill me to keep me quiet?”

Their expressions changed when they heard Yang Ye. A moment of silence ensued, and then they exchanged glances. Suddenly, a cold glow flashed through their eyes, and then they vanished on the spot. They were around Yang Ye when they appeared again, and they surrounded him.

At the same time, five terrifying auras pressed down upon Yang Ye, causing the space around him to warp while Yang Ye himself seemed like he was about to be torn into pieces!

A vicious glow flashed through Yang Ye’s eyes, and the energy of the Demon God immediately surged through him. After that, he clenched his right fist and slammed it forward!

Heaven Obliteration!

A terrifying wave of force instantly surged forward from Yang Ye’s fist.

Boom!

As soon as it surged out into the starry sky, the space in a huge area was instantly obliterated. A pitch black hole was formed in an area of tens of thousands of kilometers around Yang Ye! Moreover, once the space here collapsed, the space within the black hole was still shattering incessantly!

Just like that, around an hour passed before everything finally calmed down.

At this moment, only two people were left here. Yang Ye and the middle aged man who led the group. There was a pitch black shield in front of the middle aged man.

As for the other four, they’d been obliterated.

The armored man who led the groups stared at Yang Ye, “What a powerful fist technique…!

As soon as he finished speaking, the shield before him shattered, and its fragments shot towards the surroundings.

Crack! Crack!

Meanwhile, the bones throughout his body started to crack like the sound of fireworks resounding incessantly. At the same time, blood was ceaselessly flowing out of the corner of his mouth. Besides that, his entire body was bleeding too. In just an instant, he was covered in blood.

Suddenly, a talisman appeared in his grasp, and then it gradually vanished.

Yang Ye glanced at where the talisman vanished towards. He pressed his index and middle fingers together to form a finger sword, and he was about to attack when he seemed to have suddenly thought of something, and he relaxed his fingers.

The armored man’s body started to become ethereal, and it gradually grew more and more faint. Three breaths of time later, he’d vanished completely.

Once the armored man’s figure vanished, a wisp of blood seeped out of the corner of Yang Ye’s mouth. Moreover, his countenance turned pale!

Heaven Obliteration was too strong. Even if he strengthened himself with the energy of the Demon God, it was difficult for him to control. Even though he’d killed five Rebirth Realm experts with that attack, he actually hadn’t even released 70% of Heaven Obliterations true strength!

It wasn’t that he didn’t want to, he just couldn’t. Around 70% was his limit.

Yang Ye wiped off the blood on the corner of his mouth and spoke softly, “Looks like I need to improve my physical strength.”

Even though his body wasn’t bad, it wasn’t sufficient to face Rebirth Realm experts. Not to mention those Rebirth Realm experts who hadn’t relied on any external sources of strength to attain the Rebirth Realm, even those who had could pierce his defenses.

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings, sat down cross-legged, and started to recover.

Even though he didn’t know where he was, he had no doubt that it was very likely to be Milky Way System. He hadn’t forgotten that many people in the Yang Clan wanted him dead. Moreover, the transmission talisman the man sent off just now was probably sent to the person he served. Obviously, experts would definitely be coming here.

He hadn’t suffered very severe injuries, so it only took his body around an hour to fully recover with the help of Primordial Violet Energy.

Once he recovered, Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings, and then he gazed at a planet in the distance. If he was not wrong, they had wanted to keep him away from that planet.

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings again. Only now did he notice that the planet was the only planet in this system which seemed to have life on it.

Yang Ye remained silent for a moment, and then he shot towards that planet.

Yang Ye gradually started to frown because he sensed the smell of blood. It didn’t take long for the Heart of Slaughter within him to actually start pumping as if it was being summoned by something!

Yang Ye stopped while his eyes narrowed slightly, and a wisp of solemnness could be seen within them. Because he noticed that the planet ahead was actually covered in numerous blood red strings, and those blood red strings covered the entire planet”

Yang Ye fell silent for a moment, and then he continued forward. He stopped moving an hour later. At this moment, he could see the ground of the planet, and his face instantly turned pale at the sight of it, “What…”
