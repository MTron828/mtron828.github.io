Chapter 1575 - Sword Nucleus, Saber Soul!

Translator: InVader

An Nanjing is in danger! Yang Ye’s face immediately turned gloomy. Obviously, it was that mysterious power’s doing, and he had no doubt that he was their true target!

After he received the news about it from Ding Shaoyao, Yang Ye immediately departed for the Martial Tomb.

Even though he was confident in An Nanjing’s strength, he had no doubt that An Nanjing would be no match for that mysterious power.

…

The Martial Tomb.

The Martial Tomb was situated at the border between the Devil Territory and Demon Territory. A Martial God had once perished there, a true Martial God! A Martial God from the large world!

The Martial God!

That title was extremely prestigious! It was a title that reigned supreme above all titles, even the Sword God and other similar titles. None of them could compete with it in terms of prestige!

What was the Martial God? The Martial God was one who was godly in the Martial Dao!

The reason the Unfettered One had been so strong was because his attainments in the Sword Dao were godly.

The Martial God of Sky Sky Continent was absolutely not someone that the Martial Gods of Profounder Continent could compare to. Someone capable of being called a god here was definitely a peerless genius. After all, in the last 10,000 years of the continent’s history, besides the Unfettered One and Jian Wuji who were acknowledged as Sword Gods, there were no other people who were regarded as gods.

It didn’t take long for Yang Ye to arrive at the Martial Tomb.

The Martial Tomb was situated on Martial Tomb Mountain. Actually, Martial Tomb Mountain was the Martial Tomb. Based on its outward appearance, it was like a tomb. Supposedly, it had been specially made like this by the experts who respected and revered the Martial God.

Martial Tomb Mountain was huge, and Yang Ye couldn’t see the end of it with a single glance.

Many experts visited the Martial Tomb every year. Some came to pay their respects to the Martial God, but even more came to look for treasures. Even if an expert like the Martial God had fallen, many treasures would have definitely been left behind. Indeed, many experts had gained quite a bit on Martial Tomb Mountain.

The reason An Nanjing had come here was very simple. She wanted to take a look at that so-called Martial God!

Yang Ye snuck into Martial Tomb Mountain. He didn’t waste any time and just sped up towards the depths of the mountain.

On a hill deep within the mountain, there was a golden stone coffin there.

A woman was seated cross-legged near the coffin. She wore a white robe, had her hair tied into a ponytail, and a golden spear floated on her right.

She was An Nanjing!

There was a tiny golden figure above An Nanjing’s head, and it was ceaselessly displaying various techniques.

Suddenly, a green robed man and a white robed woman walked over slowly from afar. The young man lacked an arm, and he had a short saber hanging from his waist; the woman similarly lacked an arm, and she had a sword hanging from her waist.

It didn’t take long for them to stop. The man looked up at An Nanjing for a long time, and then he said, “So actually gained the favor of the Martial God.”

The woman nodded slightly, “It’s unexpected indeed.”

Even an idiot could discern that An Nanjing was receiving the Martial God’s inheritance right now. They knew that the Martial God’s inheritance was here, but they hadn’t expected that the Martial God would actually give it to her. After all, countless extraordinary geniuses had been here since the Martial God’s death, but none had obtained the Martial God’s favor.

The Martial God had chosen to wait for a suitable successor than to give his inheritance to just anyone!

Since An Nanjing had been able to obtain the Martial God’s acknowledgement, it was obvious how outstanding she was.

They remained silent for a long time before the man suddenly said, “Go on. Don’t kill her. Master needs her alive!”

Right when they were about to act, a middle aged man in a golden robe suddenly appeared out of thin air in front of them.

There was a tiny ‘武’ character of the middle aged man’s forehead.

The middle aged man sized up the man and woman, and then he spoke solemnly, “The Sword Nucleus and Saber Soul.”

The young man sized up the middle aged man and said, “Master was right, even if an expert like you has fallen, so long as you will it, your soul and consciousness can exist forever in the world. However, allow me to be honest, what’s the point in refusing to enter the cycle of reincarnation or taking the body of another and just living like a ghost?”

The Martial God nodded slightly, “It’s pointless. However, I have unfinished business, so I had no choice but to continue existing in the world in this form. Fortunately, my final wish will be completed soon.”

The young man glanced at An Nanjing, and then he said, “You may not be able to complete it.”

The middle aged man placed his right hand behind his back and gazed at them, “Will both of you fight me together?”

The young man shook his head slightly, “Just I am enough.”

The middle aged man fell silent for an instant, and then he suddenly smiled, “In the past, no one dared to say that to me. Of course, it’s different now. Come, let me see how strong someone who possessed the Saber Soul is.”

The young man didn’t speak. He just suddenly grabbed the saber on his waist and drew it.

Hiss!

The space in front of the young man was instantly torn open like a sharp blade had sliced through paper, and it was so swift that it instantly tore all the way to the middle aged man.

Meanwhile, the middle aged man suddenly tapped his finger forward, and the space before him shook violently. There was a thread of saber energy which was as thin as a cicada’s wing on the tip of the middle aged man’s finger, and it seemed like it was frozen in place.

A moment of silence ensued, and then the middle aged man flicked it.

Bang! Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

The saber energy shattered. Meanwhile, a ray of cold light flashed, and then a saber had struck against the middle aged man’s finger. At the same time that it struck his finger, the middle aged man twisted his finger slightly, and then two of his fingers clamped down on the saber’s blade.

Suddenly, the young man released his grasp on his saber, and then he used his palm as a blade to slash the middle aged man. Meanwhile, the middle aged man’s fingers moved along the blade of the saber and sliced down towards the young man’s palm at an angle. If it were to hit the young man, then the young man’s entire hand might vanish!

The young man knew the risks, so his palm which was slashing down towards the middle aged man had twisted like a snake in midair, and he grabbed the saber’s blade.

Suddenly, the middle aged man released the saber, and he clenched his fist instead. After that, he tapped his right foot down, and his figure shot forward while he swung a punch forward as well.

Bang!

An explosion resounded, and the young man was blasted around 300m away.

The young man looked up at the middle aged man, “As expected of the Martial God. There are no flaws in your moves. Unfortunately, your body is just a spirit body, and every attack you execute will exhaust a portion of your energy. Otherwise, perhaps only Master would be able to fight you.”

As soon as he finished speaking, the young man suddenly vanished on the spot, and he was in front of the middle aged man when he appeared once more. This time, his saber was at least a few times faster than before, and even a Rebirth Realm expert would probably find it difficult to discern the trajectory of his attack. However, the middle aged man was always able to stop the young man’s saber with extreme precision and counterattack.

The battle grew more and more intense, and the young man grew faster and faster. He was like a storm. As for the middle aged man, he was always firm like a mountain, but his body was slowly becoming translucent.

The young man was fighting a battle of attrition, and he intended to exhaust the middle aged man!

The middle aged man was clearly aware of that, and he wanted to annihilate the young man quickly. But he’d failed.

Time trickled by, and the middle aged man’s body grew more and more ethereal. Suddenly, An Nanjing opened her eyes, and then a spear tore through the air towards the young man. However, a sword stopped it when it arrived around 30m away from the young man.

An Nanjing stood up slowly and waved her right hand. Skysplit instantly flew back into her grasp. She was about to attack when the middle aged man suddenly appeared in front of her, “You’re no match for them. Leave.”

An Nanjing shook her head.

The middle aged man said, “Their strength surpasses yours too much. You are far from a match for them. Hurry up and leave. Don’t let my soul vanish for nothing.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he suddenly turned to look at the young man and woman. A moment later, he vanished on the spot, and he was in front of them when he appeared once more. After that, his figure shook, and then countless afterimages instantly appeared here.

The man and woman immediately swung their weapons. In an instant, countless strands of saber energy and sword energy crisscrossed through the area, and it caused the entire mountain to start cracking apart.

Bang!

Three breaths of time later, the entire mountain started to collapse.

At the moment Martial God Mountain started to collapse, An Nanjing had left the place. She didn’t stay because staying would be no different than giving her life away.

Not only were their cultivations much higher than hers, even their attainments in the saber and sword were greater than hers. Actually, it could be said that besides the Martial God, they were the strongest experts she’d even seen.

However, right when she left Martial God Mountain, the man and woman appeared in front of her again.

An Nanjing’s face fell, but there was no fear on her face.

The young man said, “Our master requests your presence.

An Nanjing’s eyes narrowed slightly. She was about to attack when a voice suddenly resounded, “Can you take me as well?”

An Nanjing was slightly stunned, and then she saw a ray of light descend here from afar. The light dispersed to reveal Yang Ye’s figure.

An Nanjing spoke softly, “You’re here!”

Yang Ye nodded, “Are you alright?”

“She shook her head slightly, “I’m fine.”

Yang Ye nodded, and then he gazed at them and said, “Can you take me as well?”

The young man shook his head slightly, “Master didn’t say anything about requesting your presence.”

Yang Ye shrugged, “If that’s the case, she can’t go with you.”

The young man turned to look at the woman by his side. The woman stepped forward slowly, and then she gazed at Yang Ye, “You know the Sword of Rebirth.”

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly, “How do you know that?”

She asked, “Do you know who created it?”

Yang Ye replied, “A sword cultivator!”

She looked him in the eyes and said, “I’m that sword cultivator.”

Yang Ye’s face froze.
