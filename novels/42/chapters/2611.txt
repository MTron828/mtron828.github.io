Chapter 2612 – Devour!

Training with the sword!

Yang Ye did as he said. It didn’t take long for him to start training with his sword in this endless expanse of space!

While it was called training, he was actually just destroying!

Yang Ye’s powerful sword energy and sword intent rippled madly through the entire area.

After he found out that the Void World was allied with Eternal Kingdom, he had no intention to be reasonable anymore! Because these powers and experts would never reason with him when they had the strength to crush him!

They would only reason with him when he had the strength to crush them!

Powerful sword intent and sword energy madly destroyed the world here, and it didn’t take long for even the Void World to be affected!

The living beings throughout the Void World couldn’t remain calm anymore!

A short while later, the ethereal figure from before appeared in front of Yang Ye.

At this moment, the figure was emanating powerful ripples of aura. Obviously, the ethereal figure was furious!

The figure spoke ferociously, “Yang Ye, don’t go too far!”

Yang Ye replied indifferently, “What’s your problem if I’m training with my sword?”

Meanwhile, a powerful aura suddenly enveloped Yang Ye.

But it only took a moment for the aura to be obliterated by Yang Ye’s sword intent!

Yang Ye glanced at the ethereal figure, “Do you want to train with me?”

The ethereal figure spoke solemnly, “Yang Ye, do you really think my Void World is helpless against you?”

Yang Ye chuckled, “I’m a direct person, so I don’t like to beat around the bush. I want to find my eldest sister, but this place is too huge, so I can’t find her. I’m sure you get what I mean!”

The ethereal figure replied coldly, “That’s none of my damn business! We’re not the ones who lost her!”

Yang Ye’s face turned icy cold, “I don’t care. If you don’t help, then I won’t leave until I find her.”

“Yang Ye!” The figure was slightly hysterical, “Do you think we’re fun to bully? And you can just trample upon us?”

Yang Ye raised his sword slowly and pointed it at the ethereal figure, “I’m telling you right now, I’m going to be unreasonable today. So, tell me! Are you going to help or not?!”

Blood Maiden glanced at Yang Ye and remained silent.

As for the ethereal figure, he was trembling with rage!

Yang Ye was going too far!

When had the Void World ever been humiliated like this throughout the countless years of the past?

The ethereal figure couldn’t endure it, so the space around Yang Ye suddenly cracked open. A moment later, countless strands of hair-thin black energy seeped out from space and formed a net that immediately enveloped Yang Ye.

Corrosion!

At this moment, Yang Ye’s clothes and body were actually starting to be corroded!

Even if he had the Primordial Violet Energy to heal him, it couldn’t stop the corrosion!

Yang Ye didn’t dare act carelessly and swung his sword!

The Domain Sword!

At this moment, Executor seemed capable of slicing open the world. As soon as it descended, the black net around Yang Ye vanished without a trace, and then a ray of sword energy flashed!

A moment later, Yang Ye appeared where the figure had been. Meanwhile, the figure appeared over 1km away!

The ethereal figure stared at Yang Ye with vigilance and solemness!

Yang Ye’s ability in close quarter combat was something he’d witnessed with his own eyes. Once Yang Ye was allowed to get close, it would absolutely mean death!

So, as soon as Yang Ye attacked, he’d immediately retreated and created space between them!

Once Yang Ye got close to him, he would be crippled even if he could escape death!

Yang Ye glanced at the figure, and then a flying sword shot forward!

The figure was shocked and waved the cane lightly.

Hiss!

The space before him cracked open, and Yang Ye’s flying sword entered the crack. A short while later, the crack closed. However, the space there shook violently!

Boom!

A moment of silence ensued, and then a sword howl resounded before the space there exploded open. A flying sword flashed out of the spatial rift!

Meanwhile, the ethereal figure tapped his cane forward!

It tapped directly against the tip of Yang Ye’s sword!

Bang!

Yang Ye’s flying sword was blasted away!

Yang Ye suddenly vanished on the spot, and he was before the figure when he appeared once more. However, Yang Ye hadn’t even swung his sword when the figure moved 300m away and created distance between them!

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly. He tapped his right foot down and transformed into a ray of light that shot forward!

The ethereal figure tapped his cane forward.

Hiss!

Countless threads of black energy appeared and formed a thick shield.

However, along with the descent of Yang Ye’s sword, the thick shield was obliterated. But Yang Ye frowned once more because the ethereal figure had gone around 3km back!

Yang Ye didn’t have much of an advantage when it came to speed. So, if the ethereal figure kept avoiding a direct confrontation, then Yang Ye was quite helpless against him!

The ethereal figure stared at Yang Ye, and the solemness in his eyes had turned to fear!

Yang Ye’s combat strength was already capable of killing peak Lord Realm experts with ease, but that wasn’t even the end of it. Yang Ye had an extremely sharp Super Divine Treasure!

Possessing Executor was like giving wings to a ferocious tiger, so most Lord Realm experts were no match for Yang Ye!

It could be said that there were probably less than a handful in the universe who were capable of rivaling Yang Ye in the same realm of cultivation!

Yang Ye walked slowly in the figure’s direction, “I don’t want to waste time. So, I’ll ask you one last time. Are you going to help me or not?”

The figure stared at Yang Ye. At this moment, the sword intent and sword energy around Yang Ye had vanished, but he was even more terrifying now!

The figure spoke ferociously, “Yang Ye, don’t you dare insult us. My Void World will never spare you…”

Suddenly, Yang Ye vanished on the spot.

Hiss!

The space here exploded apart inch by inch!

It had been sliced open by a sword!

The figure’s pupils constricted. At this moment, he sensed death.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye appeared before him!

They were no more than 3m away from each other!

Yang Ye swung his sword!

It was absolutely fast!

At this moment, Yang Ye seemed more like an assassin than a sword cultivator!

The ethereal figure hadn’t chosen to stay away because Yang Ye had used the Sword Domain to forcefully suppress the space he resided in. So, his speed was reduced beneath the Sword Domain, and that allowed Yang Ye to instantly appear before him.

Now, it was too late for him to flee!

Yang Ye’s sword shot forward, but the tip of it stopped right before the ethereal figure’s throat!

Blood Maiden frowned, and a blood red mist condensed around her!

The ethereal figure soundlessly vanished before Yang Ye, and then Yang Ye lowered his sword.

Meanwhile, a pitch black teleportation formation appeared before Yang Ye. At the same time, a voice resounded, “Get inside!”

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings, “Thank you!”

Yang Ye led Blood Maiden into the teleportation formation.

It didn’t take long for them to vanish in the teleportation formation.

Meanwhile, the ethereal figure appeared here once more, and he spoke solemnly, “My Lord, he insulted our Void World to such an extent. I-I can’t let it go!”

The voice suddenly asked, “Can you defeat him?”

The figure was stunned, and then quite an unsightly expression appeared on his face.

The voice asked another question, “He’s practically invincible beneath the Destiny Realm. If I don’t help, he can slaughter the entire Void World.”Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

The ethereal figure spoke solemnly, “Then why do you not take action, my Lord?”

The voice offered no reply.

Many weren’t aware of what had happened in the Origin World, but experts of their level were aware of everything.

Yang Ye’s ability to instantly kill Lord Realm experts wasn’t a huge deal. If he took action, he was 99% confident in being able to kill Yang Ye. He was truly afraid about the young girl who was backing Yang Ye, the young girl who could instantly kill Destiny Realm experts!

After all, even the master of the Divine Abode was that weak before her, and she’d even been on the verge of destroying the bridge on her own. However, the powers in that world, including the Sky Palace didn’t dare to say a word about it. Moreover, they even dealt with the other power that had offended her so that she would be appeased!

He could kill Yang Ye, but he didn’t dare to!

He wasn’t the only one. The other top experts of Eternal Kingdom didn’t dare to either. It should be said that none of them dared to take action against Yang Ye before the latter attained the Destiny Realm.

Because once they did that, they couldn’t bear the consequences of it!

…

Yang Ye and Blood Maiden appeared in a boundless expanse of space, and the world here was trembling violently!

Yang Ye and Blood Maiden exchanged glances. Meanwhile, the world around them actually started to turn ethereal!

“It’s being devoured!” Blood Maiden spoke solemnly, “It’s Eldest Sister! She’s devouring this world!”

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings, but he couldn’t find a trace of Sky Maiden!

Suddenly, the entire world started to turn ethereal. Or it should be said that the energy of this Void Planet was vanishing rapidly!

Yang Ye became quite vigilant!

Or it should be said, there was quite a solemn expression on his face!

He sensed danger!

Meanwhile, the entire Void planet was growing increasingly translucent!

Yang Ye spoke solemnly, “This is bad. This place is about to vanish.”

Yang Ye hurriedly unleashed the Sword Domain, and it enveloped both him and Blood Maiden. Just like that, they watched with astonishment as the world outside the Sword Domain started to vanish, bit by bit!

It was truly vanishing!

Yang Ye had an extremely solemn expression on his face! Sky Maiden was devouring this world!

How was she accomplishing this?

After all, devouring and destruction was different! They were two completely different things!

Meanwhile, Blood Maiden suddenly looked up, “She isn’t here.”

Yang Ye was about to speak, but his expression suddenly changed!

The mysterious devouring energy had actually started to devour his Sword Domain!
