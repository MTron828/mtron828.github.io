Chapter 2508 – You’re Shameless!

Xing Biqing suddenly said, “We’ll join forces later!”

Join forces!

Yang Ye glanced at the black shadow down below and nodded.

The unknown was the most terrifying!

He didn’t know what the black shadow was, so he wasn’t confident in being able to suppress it. If they joined forces, their chances of success would be much greater!

Yang Ye asked, “Shall we begin?”

Xing Biqing smiled, “Brother Ye, I’ve always wondered about your true strength. Will you let us witness it now?”

His true strength!

She only knew that he’d killed a Five World Realm expert, but she didn’t know if he’d used external sources of strength. Or to be precise, she wanted to know if Yang Ye had accomplished it with his own strength! After all, all monstrous geniuses had trump cards. She did too. And these trump cards weren’t part of their strength, it was the strength of their respective clans or sects.

Ye Zhibei gazed at Yang Ye too.

Yang Ye glanced at the black shadow down below, and then he flicked a ray of sword energy over.

However, the sword energy hadn’t even gotten close to the black shadow before it vanished without a trace!

Yang Ye frowned at the sight of this.

It was very strange!

Xing Biqing and Ye Zhibei had solemn expressions on their faces too.

In the end, Yang Ye said, “Young Miss Ye and I will keep it busy. Miss Biqing, you get the armor. Let’s get it and get out quick!”

Xing Biqing hesitated for a moment and said, “Ye Zhibei and I will keep it busy, you get the armor. After all, we’re the ones who want it.”

Yang Ye wanted to say something, but they had charged down there.

Bang! Bang!

Two powerful waves of pressure swept down and instantly locked onto the drifting black shadow. At this moment, the shadow stopped moving!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye appeared beside the armor on his sword. He was about to take it when a huge pitch black hand swept at him. Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly, and he swung his sword.

Bang!

Yang Ye’s figure was blasted away!

At the same time, Ye Zhibei and Xing Biqing were blasted away as well.

At this moment, there was an extremely obvious trace of scarlet red on the corner of their mouths!

Yang Ye looked down at the black shadow, and it was drifting again.

Meanwhile, Xing Biqing suddenly said, “It’s too strong!”

Yang Ye asked, “Do you know what it is?”

Xing Biqing shook her head, “Both of us don’t even know how it blasted us away. It’s too mysterious, even its attacks are mysterious.”

Ye Zhibei withdrew a cucumber and took a bite, “The Lord Realm! At least!”

A Lord Realm expert!

Yang Ye fell silent for a moment and said, “Help me keep it busy for five breaths of time!”

Five breaths!

They glanced at him and didn’t say a word. They just shot down toward the black shadow. Meanwhile, Yang Ye vanished on the spot.

Yang Ye was by the armor when he appeared again, and he stretched out his right hand toward it.

Suddenly, the black hand from before swept at him again!

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly as he swung his sword!

This time, he used Executor!

Hiss!

The black hand instantly cracked apart, and then a strand sound came from not too far below.

The hand shrunk back, and then Yang Ye grabbed the armor. However, the armor suddenly emanated a torrent of blood red flames that enveloped Yang Ye!

It was trying to incinerate Yang Ye!

Yang Ye was shocked by this and hurriedly tossed it into the Primordial Pagoda!

Once it was within the pagoda, it planned to resist once more, and a torrent of flames surged into the sky. It was trying to incinerate the world within the pagoda. However, doing that was no different than incurring public wrath.

An ethereal golden pagoda shot down from the sky and slammed against the armor, and then the Primordial Axe of Creation, Universe Seal, Seal of Suppression, two swords, and many other Divine Treasures charged at it!

The Primordial Pagoda was their home, but this fellow was running wild upon entering their home, so they naturally couldn’t stand by idly!

Only two could do anything they wanted without paying a price, and that was Snowy and Erya!

As for Yang Ye, he usually went berserk in the outside world, so they didn’t care!

Yang Ye ignored the armor and planned to leave upon obtaining it. However, an extremely powerful aura suddenly came from below.

Meanwhile, Ye Zhibei and Xing Biqing were about to retreat when a wave of powerful black mist enveloped them.

Yang Ye practically didn’t hesitate to send both his flying swords forward and slice open the mist. But the mist grew upon being sliced open!RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Moreover, it even surged up into the air and enveloped the space above them!

Yang Ye ignored the black mist and shot down. It didn’t take long for him to see Ye Zhibei and Xing Biqing. At this moment, they had their backs to each other while an extremely solemn expression covered their faces. Besides that, there were numerous injuries on them!

They were quite surprised to see him!

Yang Ye went over to them, glanced at the surroundings, and asked, “Are you alright?”

Xing Biqing glanced at the surroundings, “Be careful. It has locked down this area, so we can’t get out!”

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings, “Both of you leave first!”

They gazed at him with bewilderment.

Yang Ye didn’t say anything, and he just withdrew a seal, the Universel Seal!

It could undo all seals, barriers, and formations!

Yang Ye wanted to see if the old man had been exaggerating!

Yang Ye activated the seal, and a wave of invisible force instantly surged out from the seal. A short while later, the invisible barrier around them vanished without a trace!

Both of them were overjoyed. They were about to leave when a wave of powerful energy surged up from below and shot at them.

Yang Ye pressed his right hand down, and the Universe Seal descended!

The strength to destroy five worlds!

As soon as they came into contact, the entire abyss shook, and waves of powerful energy and explosions surged throughout the surroundings!

Meanwhile, something seemed to be surging down below!

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly. He waved his right hand, and the seal was about to return to him when a strand of black energy enveloped it and rendered the seal immobile. Moreover, the black energy instantly dragged the seal down.

A cold glow flashed through Yang Ye’s eyes when he witnessed this.

Two sword howls resounded, and then two flying swords shot down.

Meanwhile, a black hand shot up into the air and grabbed both the swords. A short while later, the black hand dragged the swords down too!

Yang Ye was shocked by the sight of this, and he wondered if that thing knew how to steal treasures too!

A short while later, an ethereal figure appeared before them, and there were three things floating behind it. It was the Universe Seal and Yang Ye’s swords!

The ethereal figure suddenly pointed at Yang Ye, “Return it!”

Yang Ye frowned slightly, “What?”

Suddenly, the figure waved its right hand.

Bang!

A strand of black energy rippled out and blasted all three of them away. Moreover, three strands of black energy appeared around them and completely bound them!

Bang!

Suddenly, the black energy around Xing Biqing exploded apart, and a strand of golden energy had appeared around her. The golden energy was circulating slowly around her!

At practically the exact same moment, the black energy around Ye Zhibei vanished, and a pitch black whip had appeared in her grasp.

It was a whip made of bones!

They gazed at Yang Ye. A few rays of sword energy flashed around Yang Ye, and the black energy vanished without a trace!

The ethereal figure said, “I underestimated you!”

Ye Zhibei suddenly leaped up, and then countless black whip images instantly enveloped the ethereal figure. At the same time, Xing Biqing suddenly attacked, and a strand of golden light instantly slammed against the ethereal figure.

However, the ethereal figure didn’t try to dodge at all and just allowed their attacks to hit it!

The ethereal figure remained completely unharmed!

Meanwhile, it vanished on the spot.

Bang!

In an instant, all three of them were blasted over 1km away!

They stopped themselves simultaneously, and then a wisp of blood seeped out from the corner of their mouths.

The ethereal figure was about to attack again when Yang Ye raised a hand, “I think we can talk about it!”

The other two were stunned speechless by this.

The ethereal figure stopped and spoke indifferently, “Why? Let’s just fight! All three of you haven’t even used your trump cards. Especially these two girls, they are just half a step away from the Lord Realm. No, I should say that if they haven’t been forcefully suppressing their cultivations, they would be at the Lord Realm by now. Perhaps you can win if all three of you use your full strengths!”

Yang Ye spoke seriously, “We’re not unreasonable people. When there is conflict, we should speak about it!”

The ethereal figure waved its right hand, and the swords and seal behind it flew back to Yang Ye, “I’m not an unreasonable person either. Since you want to talk, then let’s talk!”

Yang Ye smiled embarrassedly and took the three treasures, and then he said, “How would you like to talk about it?”

The ethereal figure replied indifferently, “That armor is mine.”

All of them were at a loss for words.

The ethereal figure continued, “But I can give it to you.”

Yang Ye hurriedly asked, “How could we possibly accept that? But since you wish to give it to us, then we must accept it out of respect, Senior. After all, we dare not refuse our seniors!”

Xing Biqing and Ye Zhibei were stunned speechless.

A short while passed before the ethereal figure said, “You’re no honorable sword cultivator, you’re shameless!”
