Chapter 1527 - The Blood Sword Demon?

Translator: InVader

The large world.

After he passed through the door, Yang Ye’s head felt heavy. Besides because he was being teleported, there was one other reason, and it was because he’d started to suffer backlash from his sword intent.

It was horrible!

It was horrible to suffer backlash at a time like this.

Persist!

All Yang Ye could do now was hold on, hold on until the teleportation was over. Even though it was extremely painful, Yang Ye constantly maintained consciousness.

He naturally didn’t dare to let himself fall unconscious at a time like this!

It didn’t take long for Yang Ye to feel that his figure had stopped.

Yang Ye opened his eyes. A blue sky and white clouds above him while an endless ocean beneath him. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

The large world!

At this moment, he’d truly stepped foot into the large world.

Abundant spirit energy!

That was the first thing which Yang Ye noticed. The spirit energy here was much more abundant than the lower dimensions. However, it couldn’t compare to the Primordial Pagoda. Of course, that was because there were numerous Spirit Veins within the Primordial Pagoda. How could the spirit energy there not be abundant when there were so many Spirit Veins within it?

Yang Ye didn’t stay on the spot, and he immediately vanished.

Even though he was in the large world now, it didn’t mean he was safe. The Emperor Sect and War Pavilion would definitely not stop hunting him. Once they found out that he was within the large world, they would definitely send experts to kill him. However, he was suffering backlash from his sword intent and had just utilized the Stellar Sword Diagram, so he was at his weakest. If one of their Rebirth Realm experts found him right now, he would definitely die!

Yang Ye found a small island nearby. Once he confirmed that it was safe, he snuck onto the island and found a safe place to hide himself.

He had to recover!

Presently, he was all alone, so he had to remain at his peak at all times. Because regardless of whether it was the Emperor Sect or War Pavilion, if they sent someone to hunt him down, it would definitely be a Rebirth Realm expert at least. Yet now, he couldn’t utilize the Stellar Sword Diagram, so he couldn’t kill Rebirth Realm experts.

Four hours later, Yang Ye had recovered completely, and then he started refining Sword Servants. Dualism Realm Sword Servants were quite useful to him.

Every single Sword Servant he gained was an extra form of protection to him!

It was the first time Yang Ye was refining Dualism Realm Sword Servants, so he did encounter some problems. Fortunately, he was able to resolve them. His current ability at refining Sword Servants had surpassed the person who created this technique.

Once he finished refining them, Yang Ye left the small island.

This time, his destination was the Divine Phoenix Clan!

The Divine Phoenix Clan was more important when compared to the War Pavilion and Emperor Sect. Because Zi’er and Snowy were there. He was very well aware that he may not be able to fight the Divine Phoenix Clan, so he wouldn’t do something foolish like going head-on with them.

He had no ties here in the large world!

A sword cultivator with no ties was the most terrifying, just like the Unfettered One.

Yang Ye was new here, so he didn’t know anything about the place. Thus, the important matter at hand was to look for an inhabited place, and then gain an understanding of the large world.

Otherwise, it was such a huge place, so how would he find the Divine Phoenix Clan?

Around four hours later, Yang Ye finally flew out of the boundless ocean and arrived on land. After that, he flew almost two more hours before he saw a city.

If there was a city, then there would naturally be people!

However, Yang Ye frowned when he got close.

The smell of blood!

An extremely dense smell of blood was coming from the city.

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment, and then he shot into the city. Once he entered the city, his expression changed slightly because corpses covered the city!

A dense expanse of corpses!

Besides corpses, the streets had been transformed into rivers of blood. Such a scene was almost similar to how Celestial Demon City had been that day.

The city had been slaughtered!

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings, and then his divine sense swept out in all directions. Suddenly, he looked towards the distance, and then his figure vanished on the spot.

It didn’t take long for Yang Ye to arrive before a house. Its door was pushed open with a wave of Yang Ye’s right hand, and then Yang Ye saw two children behind the door. A boy and a girl. Both of them were around the ages of five or six.

The girl was slightly older. At this moment, she was standing in front of the boy, and she held a short dagger in her grasp. She was staring at Yang Ye. While her eyes had no fear in them, her hand which held the dagger was trembling slightly. As for the young boy, he was holding her sleeve tightly while terror filled his eyes.

Survivors!

The two children were the only survivors in the city!

Yang Ye sized up the children. Based on their dressing, they were either rich or noble. Suddenly, Yang Ye’s gaze descended onto the necklace the young girl wore. As soon as his gaze descended onto it, the young girl’s expression changed, and then she said something. The necklace suddenly emanated a ray of dazzling blue light. It was extremely swift and struck Yang Ye before he could even react.

Bang!

Yang Ye was caught off guard and blasted away.

The young girl heaved a sigh of relief when she saw Yang Ye being blasted away. However, Yang Ye suddenly appeared in front of her again.

She was shocked and hurriedly moved backwards with the young boy.

Yang Ye glanced at the necklace, and a trace of surprise flashed through his eyes. That attack was on par with the full strength of a Dualism Realm expert. Because the skin on his chest had cracked open. Even though it wasn’t very serious, it had cracked open. After all, his body was at the Undying Realm!

Yang Ye glanced at the young boy and child, and then he turned around and walked away.

The young girl was slightly stunned when she saw him turn around and leave, and then she suddenly dragged the young boy along and chased after Yang Ye. She ran over to Yang Ye, knelt before Yang Ye, and said, “Save my younger brother!” As she spoke, she hurriedly made the young boy kneel as well.

Yang Ye was moved when he heard her. What she said was very interesting because she’d asked him to save her younger brother and not both of them!

Yang Ye remained silent for a moment, and then he said, “Who are you? What are you doing here? What happened here?”

She glanced at him and spoke softly, “I’m Qin Xue, my younger brother is Qin Yuan. We’re from one of the five top clans, the Qin Clan. We…”

It didn’t take long for Yang Ye to come to a complete understanding.

These siblings had come here with their second uncle to take care of some business, and they were staying in the city. But they were absolutely unlucky because for some unknown reason, someone had come to slaughter the city. Besides them, no one else survived. The reason they’d survived was the necklace on Qin Xue’s neck.

It was exactly that necklace which had protected them and allowed them to escape calamity.

However, they hadn’t started cultivating, so they didn’t dare to come out from where they hid.

Yang Ye gazed at Qin Xue and smiled, “You want me to take you back to the Qin Clan?”

“Thank you, Big Brother!” Qin Xue suddenly kowtowed to Yang Ye, “We’ll never forget your kindness.”

Yang Ye’s face froze. A moment later, he shook his head. She’s really quite smart!

Meanwhile, Qin Xue said, “The Qin Clan will repay you as well!”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and said, “Come, let’s go to the Qin Clan!”

Qin Xue beamed when she heard Yang Ye, and then she pulled the young boy over to Yang Ye’s side. Yang Ye smiled, and then he took their hands and intended to leave.

However, a few rays of light suddenly appeared in the sky. They were extremely swift, and it didn’t take long for them to arrive before Yang Ye’s group.

The light dispersed to reveal three middle aged men.

One Dualism Realm expert and two Deities!

All three of them glanced at Yang Ye’s group. After that, one of them glanced at the city, and then he gazed at the red robed middle aged man who led their group, “We’re too late!”

The red robed middle aged man gazed at Yang Ye, “You did this?”

Yang Ye was stunned, “What?”

The red robed middle aged man asked, “Were you the one who slaughtered this city?”

Yang Ye hurriedly shook his head, “It definitely wasn’t me.” What a joke! He refused to take responsibility for this.

The red robed man said, “When has the Blood Sword Demon been afraid of admitting what he has done?”

The Blood Sword Demon? Yang Ye frowned, “You’ve really got the wrong person. I’m not the Blood Sword Demon. I was just passing by. Right, these two children can speak on my behalf!”

Qin Xue hurriedly nodded, “We can guarantee that these people in the city really weren’t killed by him.”

The red robed man gazed at Yang Ye, “I can smell the smell of blood coming from you and a trace of slaughter intent. If I’m not wrong, your slaughter intent is at the Quasi Returnal Rank.”

His gaze descended onto Yang Ye’s sword, and then he continued, “Besides the Blood Sword Demon, is there anyone else amongst the younger generation who uses a sword and possesses Quasi Returnal Rank sword intent?”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

Meanwhile, the red robed man waved his right hand, “Capture him and take him back to the pavilion!”

As soon as he finished speaking, the two others by his side were about to act. However, Yang Ye suddenly asked, “The pavilion? Is it the War Pavilion?”

The red robed man spoke indifferently, “What other pavilion?”

“Tsk, tsk!” Yang Ye shook his head, “What a coincidence.”

His sword suddenly vanished. The red robed middle aged man’s face suddenly changed drastically at the exact same instant, and he instinctively slapped both his palms forward.

Boom!

The red robed middle aged man was blasted away.

Suddenly, a ray of light flashed.

Hiss!

His head flew up into the air.

A Dualism Realm expert had been killed with just two attacks!

The two Deities here were flabbergasted!

A Dualism Realm expert had been instantly annihilated just like that!

Suddenly, Yang Ye gazed at those two Deities and said, “Go back to your War Pavilion and tell them that I, Blood Sword Demon, declare war on you from this moment, and I won’t stop until I annihilate you!”

Both the Deities were at a loss for words.
