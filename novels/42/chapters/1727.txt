Chapter 1728 - World Ripper!

Yang Ye was quite stunned.

He was certain that he didn’t know her at all.

Yang Ye sized up the woman and asked, “I owe you something?”

She looked him in the eyes, “You took something that doesn’t belong to you.”

Yang Ye frowned, “Can you make it a little clearer?”

“The wooden sword!” She gazed at Yang Ye, “That wooden sword doesn’t belong to you!”

The wooden sword! Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly. He hadn’t expected her to actually be here for the wooden sword. It belongs to her?

Yang Ye fell silent for a moment, and then he said, “I got it from the Wu Clan.”

She replied, “My Secret Sect left it in the Wu Clan.”

Yang Ye shook his head, “I need proof.”

She said, “Tell it to show itself, and you’ll get your proof.”

Yang Ye glanced at her, thought for a moment, and then he summoned Snowy. Snowy was holding the wooden sword when she emerged from the Primordial Pagoda. Presently, Snowy had gotten addicted to playing with the wooden sword, so it never left her claws.

The reason he was cooperating was because he wanted to find out about the wooden sword’s origins. Of course, he wouldn’t feel any regret if it chose her in the end. Presently, he refused to utilize any external sources of strength unless he had to, and he refused to let himself become reliant upon any external sources of strength.

Moreover, he was certain that the wooden sword wouldn’t choose to go with her.

What a joke! The wooden sword was so close to Snowy. Or it should be said that the wooden sword obeyed everything that Snowy said. Moreover, he had the Primordial Pagoda too. So, unless the wooden sword’s real owner showed himself or herself, it would never leave!

After Snowy appeared here, she glanced at the surroundings, blinked, and then wrapped her claws around Yang Ye’s neck before rubbing her head lightly against Yang Ye’s chin.

The woman’s gaze had been on the wooden sword, but she couldn’t help but glance at Snowy who was completely white as snow.

Yang Ye rubbed her head gently, and then he gazed at the wooden sword which was floating in front of him.

Suddenly, the woman formed a strange seal with her hands, and then a dragon roar resounded.

As soon as the dragon roar resounded, the wooden sword floated over to her and trembled slightly.

Snowy kept blinking as she watched this scene.

Meanwhile, the woman’s lips parted, and she seemed to be saying something to the wooden sword, and the wooden sword was shaking slightly as if it was conversing with her.

A short while passed before a sword howl resounded from the wooden sword, and then it flew over to Snowy before starting to converse with her.

A while later, Snowy suddenly grabbed the wooden sword and wrapped her arms around it. After that, she glared angrily at the woman and seemed like she intended to fight the woman to the death.

Yang Ye frowned slightly, and then he took Snowy in his arms, “What’s going on?”

Snowy seemed to have found her savior, and she started to wave her little claws about and even pointed at the woman while she waved them about.

A short while passed before Yang Ye came to an understanding.

The wooden sword wanted to go with her!

Yang Ye gazed at the wooden sword. He hadn’t expected that it would actually want to go with her.

Yang Ye gazed at the woman in a white dress, “Why does it want to go with you?”

She glanced at Yang Ye, gazed at Snowy, and then replied, “Both of you can’t keep it. Because it has to complete its mission.”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Its mission?”

She replied, “It’s staying in this world because of its mission. Now, we need it.”

Suddenly, Snowy gazed at Yang Ye, and then she started waving her claws about swiftly.

It was obvious what she wanted. She didn’t want the wooden sword to go.

Yang Ye rubbed her head and was about to speak, but the wooden sword suddenly started trembling. A short while passed before Snowy’s eyes lit up, and then she gazed at Yang Ye and started waving her claws again.

A short while later, Yang Ye frowned and said, “It says that it wants us to go with it? And it’ll stay with you once it has completed its mission?”

Snowy nodded rapidly.

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and said, “We can’t go now.” He hadn’t dealt with the Yang Clan yet, so he couldn’t go anywhere else.

Snowy’s eyes instantly turned moist when she heard Yang Ye, and she seemed like she would cry at any moment.

Yang Ye shook his head and said, “Oh you…” He gazed at the woman and asked, “Is it very urgent?”

She glanced at Yang Ye, “I’m really curious about why it’s actually willing to stay with you. Based on the baleful and murderous aura you have, it should feel extreme aversion to you.”

“It’s my charm!” Yang Ye spoke seriously, “Do you understand what that is? It’s my charm that won her over!”

The woman spoke indifferently, “If it’s shamelessness, then yes. As for charm, I don’t think so.”

Yang Ye was rendered speechless.

Suddenly, she said, “Face an attack of mine!”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Why?”

She said, “Let me see if you’re qualified to come to the Secret Sect with it!”

Yang Ye glanced at her and nodded, “Alright!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he gazed at Snowy. The latter was very sensible, and she immediately grabbed the wooden sword and entered the Primordial Pagoda.

Yang Ye stood there with his sword in hand, “Bring it!”

He didn’t act carelessly, nor did he dare to. Because he couldn’t sense her cultivation and aura at all. Moreover, she was related to the wooden sword, so how could she be ordinary?

The woman nodded slightly, and then she took a step forward before placing her hands on the two swords hanging from her waist.

She looked Yang Ye in the eyes, and then her lips parted, “World Ripper!”

As soon as she finished speaking, her swords swiftly left their sheaths.

Hiss!

The sound of something being torn apart resounded. It was like the sound of a scissor cutting through cloth.

After that, Yang Ye was suddenly pushed backwards repeatedly, and it didn’t take long for him to arrive before the city walls of Sword Immortal City. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Bang!

The entire city shook violently!

At the same time, a spatial rift had appeared between Yang Ye and the woman. The spatial extended from the ground up into the clouds, and it seemed like it had sliced open a hole in space that linked the heavens and the earth!

Everyone looked in Yang Ye’s direction. There was a wisp of extremely obvious scarlet red on the corner of Yang Ye’s mouth!

Yang Ye lost?

Such a thought ran through the minds of all the spectators.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye wiped off the blood on the corner of his mouth, and then he looked up at the woman in a white dress, “You try an attack of mine too!”

As soon as he finished speaking, the woman immediately frowned slightly, and then her swords left their sheaths again.

Bang!

An explosion resounded abruptly, and then the woman appeared 3km away.

The surroundings suddenly fell silent.

She gazed at Yang Ye for a long time before she said, “What’s the name of that technique?”

Yang Ye replied, “Split Second.”

“Split Second…” She nodded slightly, “It’s a very strong technique, and it has a huge amount of space to grow.”

Yang Ye walked closer to her and said, “How do I get to the Secret Sect?”

She pondered deeply for a moment, and then she flipped her right palm. A small blue stone appeared before Yang Ye, “A teleportation formation will appear once you crush this. It’ll transport you to the Secret Sect’s entrance.”

As soon as she finished speaking, she didn’t say another word. She just turned around and left.

Yang Ye glanced at the blue stone in his grasp, and then he put it away. Actually, if it was up to him, he wouldn’t go to the Secret Sect. However, he was willing to do so for Snowy. If it was too troublesome to deal with, then he intended to flee with Snowy and the wooden sword.

Based on his current strength, even ten True Realm experts couldn’t stop him from escaping!

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings, and then he sat down cross-legged. After that, he withdrew two Energy Pearls and started to recover his profound energy.

That attack just now had exhausted too much of his profound energy. Even though Split Second was strong, it exhausted a huge amount of profound energy too. Fortunately, he had Snowy with him. Otherwise, he wouldn’t dare to stay here and keep fighting!

The veil of night gradually vanished.

It didn’t take long for the first glimmer of dawn to arrive. A short while later, a ray of sunlight descended onto Yang Ye.

Actually, the night hadn’t been peaceful at all. After the woman in the white dress had left, many others had arrived below the city walls.

However, practically all their heads were arranged below the city walls right now. There were at least 500 heads there. If one walked closer, it simply seemed like a small hill of heads.

Some amongst those who came for his head had decisively chosen to leave after seeing those heads.

They left without the slightest hesitation.

Yang Ye didn’t pursue those people. However, when it came to those who attacked him, he didn’t show mercy at all, and he annihilated every single one of them!

That was exactly why the ground before Yang Ye had turned red when dawn arrived.

It had been dyed red with blood!

The spectators on the city walls were still there. They were still waiting, waiting for more to come and try to kill Yang Ye. As far as they were concerned, it was a rare opportunity for them to watch battles.

They hoped even more people came to kill Yang Ye, and they hoped to watch Yang Ye kill even more.

Everyone liked to watch a show!

Time trickled by. Noon.

A point in the distant sky suddenly trembled, and then a man in a beautiful robe appeared there.

An instant later, the man had arrived not too far away from Yang Ye.

He wore a violet embroidered robe. Based on his appearance, he seemed to be around the age of 25. His appearance was only ordinary, but he had a very calm and confident bearing.

Suddenly, someone on the city walls exclaimed with shock, “It’s him! My god! It’s actually him! He’s actually here to kill Yang Ye…”
