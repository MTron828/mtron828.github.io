Chapter 2179 – Brother Yang, Farewell!

Book 19 — The End Times

Five progenitors!

Yang Wudi walked out of the bamboo house and went over to them. He smiled as he gazed at them, “What a huge force!”

“You’re Yang Ye’s father, right?” Meanwhile, Shao Siyou stepped forward, “I investigated you. You’re from the Yang Clan, and you were driven to Profounder Continent when something happened to you all those years ago. You met Yang Ye’s mother in Profounder Continent, and then you suddenly vanished after Yang Ye was born. I’m really curious, what were you up to during those years that you vanished?”

Yang Wudi glanced at her and asked, “Shao Siyou?”

Shao Siyou smiled, “Yes!”

He grinned, “I can tell you that I vanished all these years to deal with someone.”

She asked, “Who?”

He chuckled, “Go figure!”

Shao Siyou frowned slightly.

However, Yang Wudi ignored her and gazed at the Weapon Progenitor and the others, “Looks like you chose to take the Sprite Lord in the end.”

The Weapon Progenitor replied indifferently, “Are you very surprised/”

He shook his head, “Not at all. It’s within my expectations.”

He glanced at the others and said, “Then bring it.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he vanished into the sky.

The other progenitors vanished with him.

Far away in outer space, a shocking battle soundlessly began.

It went on for three days and three nights, and countless expanses of space were blasted apart while countless smaller universes were obliterated. However, it didn’t cause a commotion because the area had been sealed off.

On the fourth day, the battle finally stopped. In an expanse of collapsed space, a man laid there silently, and endless black holes and shattered space surrounded him.

It was Yang Wudi.

A long time passed before a middle aged man suddenly arrived here. He was the Martial Emperor.

The Martial Emperor gazed at the middle aged man for a long time and said, “Brother Yang, farewell!”

He turned around and left.

Just like that, the surroundings fell quiet again. Around two hours later, a middle aged man in a cloud white robe appeared. However, his figure was slightly ethereal. Obviously, it wasn’t his main body!

The middle aged man gazed at Yang Wudi’s corpse for a long time, and then he said, “I only had two opponents in my life. Now, I only have one.”

The middle aged man waved his right hand, and then three rays of sword energy protected Yang Wudi’s corpse.

An instant later, he vanished.

At a certain corner, a woman in a white dress stood there silently.

It was Ding Shaoyao.

She closed her eyes slowly, “Even when injured, he was still able to heavily injure five progenitors. Yang Wudi… You really live up to your name of being invincible!”

She turned around and left.

…

The Human Dimension. Nature Sacred Grounds.

Yang Ye left the Primordial Pagoda and arrived in the hall there. The Sages of the human race were gathered here, and everyone gazed at him.

Yang Ye spoke softly, “Are they here?”

Yang Lianshuang nodded.

Yang Ye grinned, “Alright, we’ll deal with them in one go!”

Yang Ye led the others out of the hall.

Outside, or to be more precise, in the sky above the Human Dimension, the area had been sealed off. There were around 100 Sages in the sky above Nature Sacred Ground!

100 Sages!

This time, the Alliance of All had sent all its elites and hadn’t held back at all. All of their Sages were here!

Their goal was very simple, it was to kill Yang Ye and take the Sprite Lord!

The Demon God was leading the group.

The Demon God looked down at Yang Ye, “Yang Ye, hand over the Sprite Lord, then you and the human race can live. Otherwise, all of you will die. This is your last chance!”

Hand over the Sprite Lord!

All the Sages of the human race fell silent. The Alliance of All’s goal was very simple, they wouldn’t stop until they obtained the Sprite Lord!

Meanwhile, one of the human Sages hesitated to speak, “Young Brother Yang…”

Yang Ye glanced at the other Sages, and all of them remained silent.

Actually, Yang Ye knew what they were thinking. As far as they were concerned, the human race and Yang Ye would be saved if Yang Ye handed over the Sprite Lord, and that was worth it no matter what. The human race couldn’t allow itself to be annihilated for a Sprite Lord!

It wasn’t just the Sages here who thought in that way, practically 90% or more of the human race was of the same opinion!

Meanwhile, Snowy and Tian Xiu appeared in front of Yang Ye. Snowy gazed at Yang Ye and waved her claws while tears flowed incessantly from her. Her tears evaporated and quickly covered the area in mist.

She was telling him to give her to them! She was willing to do that!

Tian Xiu didn’t say a word and just gazed at them.

As he gazed at Snowy who was crying incessantly, Yang Ye suddenly started roaring with laughter, and his laughter reverberated like a thunderclap through the sky.

Everyone gazed at Yang Ye.

They naturally didn’t dare look down on Yang Ye. He was someone who possessed the strength to instantly kill Sages. Not to mention that Yang Ye had An Nanjing by his side, so they didn’t dare to underestimate Yang Ye at all.

A short while passed before Yang Ye stopped, and then he gazed at Snowy who was still crying and said, “As the king of the human race, I should think for the good of the entire race. I won’t let the human race down, but I won’t let you down either, Snowy. From this moment onward, I, Yang Ye, have nothing to do with the human race!”

He looked up into the sky and continued, “You want the Sprite Lord? Come get her!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he took Snowy and Tian Xiu in his arms before leaving.

Abandon Snowy for the human race?

He couldn’t do that!

He couldn’t!

He didn’t blame the human race for not taking his side and protecting Snowy with him. So, he chose to leave with Snowy and face the Sages of the Alliance of All on his own!

Once Yang Ye left, the monkey and Qiong Qi left with him. Besides that, one more person left, and it was An Nanjing. However, the Sages of Martial Emperor Academy didn’t go with her.

Yang Ye stopped far away in outer space because the Demon God’s group were in front of him. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

The monkey, An Nanjing, and Qiong Qi were by Yang Ye’s side.

Two humans, two demons, and 100 Sages!

Based on their numbers, Yang Ye’s side was at an utter disadvantage!

Yang Ye gazed at An Nanjing, smiled, and then gazed at the monkey and Qiong Qi, “Both of you can leave!” The Alliance of All was after him, and he didn’t want them to lose their lives here.

The monkey shook his head, “When I was in danger, only you lent me a hand. Now, you are in danger, so how can I leave?”

Yang Ye wanted to say something, but the monkey shook his head, “There’s no need to say anything else!”

Yang Ye couldn’t do anything about the monkey’s decision, so he gazed at Qiong Qi. Qiong Qi was about to speak when Yang Ye grabbed him by the shoulder and forcefully transported him into the Primordial Pagoda.

In an instant, the Primordial Pagoda suppressed Qiong Qi!

It wasn’t that he felt Qiong Qi was too weak, it was that Qiong Qi may be killed in an instant if he joined a battle of this level.

Now, only Yang Ye, An Nanjing, and the monkey remained.

But there were 100 Sages before them!

Suddenly, the monkey stepped forward, “Allow me to start this battle!”

As soon as he said that, the monkey waved his right hand. In an instant, a burning red golden rod appeared in his grasp. At the same time, he hurled it at the Demon God and the other Sages.

The golden rod grew larger and larger. In an instant, it was almost 3km long, and the powerful force it carried caused space to turn ethereal. It was a clear display of how terrifying the energy within it was.

The monkey’s attack was so shocking that the Demon God and the others didn’t dare to act carelessly. An entire 20 Sages immediately charged at him.

20 Sages!

The monkey wasn’t able to defeat them. But his eyes carried no fear, and there was only battle intent, blazing battle intent!

Yang Ye gazed at An Nanjing, “Be careful!”

An Nanjing nodded, and then Elysium appeared in her right grasp. After that, it started trembling, and rays of terrifying pressure seeped out from within it. An instant later, An Nanjing stomped her right foot down, and she transformed into a beam of light that shot at their enemies.

Yang Ye slowly closed his eyes as he stood on the spot.

An impossible dilemma.

Yang Ye had Snowy, so the Alliance of All would never let him go. But when the Alliance of All’s army really came, the Sages of the human race chose to make a compromise. He didn’t blame them for that choice. Because if sacrificing a single person and a Sprite Lord could bring peace to the human race, then the Sages of the human race and the entire human race itself would agree to that.

Yang Ye chose to be understanding toward that, so he chose to leave. From now onward, the matters of the human race had nothing to do with him! He was him, and they were they. Their life and death had nothing to do with each other! It was the choice that he and the human race had made!

Yang Ye remained silent for a moment, and then he suddenly opened his eyes. Two rays of blood red light flashed from them. At the same time, a strand of terrifying slaughter intent swept out from within him. In just an instant, the entire area had turned scarlet red.

Slaughter intent!

Powerful slaughter intent that could affect the minds of Sages!

All the Sages were shocked, and they circulated their profound energy to resist it.

A moment later, a sword appeared in his grasp, and he started walking slowly in the Demon God’s direction, “Even if I die here today, I’ll bury all of you with me! Bring it!”

A ray of blood red sword energy flashed forward.

In an instant, an ear piercing sword howl resounded through the battlefield, and the entire expanse of space here cracked open. Moreover, the cracks were spreading rapidly. In just a short while, the space in a huge area had cracked open.

It was an extremely shocking sight!
