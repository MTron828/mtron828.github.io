Chapter 2587

Finally, the light stopped.

“The Sword Domain!” Meanwhile, the voice resounded, “Are you willing to let a Memory Stone here record your Sword Domain? And leave behind some of your comprehensions in the Sword Dao?”

Yang Ye asked, “What will I get from that?”

The voice fell silent for a short while before speaking again, “You’ll receive the corresponding compensation.”

Yang Ye smiled, “Be a little more specific.”

The voice replied, “Among the 29 sword cultivators, two of them possessed the Sword Domain, and those Sword Domains are completely different from yours. You can choose one of them to observe that person’s Sword Domain and comprehensions.”

The Sword Domain!

Yang Ye fell silent.

He wasn’t the only owner of the Sword Domain!

A short while passed before Yang Ye nodded, “Alright!”

Meanwhile, the pillar of light before Yang Ye shook, and then a wave of mysterious energy appeared in the surroundings.

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings and activated the Sword Domain while leaving behind some of his comprehensions!

It didn’t take long for all of it to be recorded.

Once that was done, the mysterious energy vanished. Meanwhile, the voice resounded once more, “Both Sword Domains are completely different. One is offensive, a Sword Domain of slaughter with extremely powerful slaughter intent, allowing it to cloud another’s mind with ease. The other Sword Domain is more focused, it focuses on the sword. In other words, his Sword Domain is on his sword and not a domain of its own.”

The voice paused for a moment and said, “Which will you choose?”

A Sword Domain of slaughter? A Sword Domain that focuses on the sword?

Yang Ye frowned slightly. Actually, he was very curious about both of them. So, he asked, “Can I take a look at both?”

The voice resounded, “Sorry, that is not possible!”

Yang Ye puckered his lips and thought for a long time. In the end, he said, “The Sword Domain that focuses on the sword.”

Actually, he was more inclined to choose the Sword Domain of slaughter because he possessed powerful slaughter intent too. However, he’d chosen the other in the end. As for the reason, he wasn’t very sure, it was just a feeling!

As soon as Yang Ye gave his answer, the pillar of light before Yang Ye shook, and then it gradually vanished. A short while later, a sword cultivator with a sword in hand appeared before Yang Ye.

He was very ordinary!

That was Yang Ye’s first impression of him.

Yang Ye watched with concentration, and a short while passed before the sword cultivator drew his sword!

Yang Ye’s pupils constricted at the sight of this, and astonishment covered his face.

A short while later, the sword cultivator had vanished, but Yang Ye was still stunned on the spot.

In the Primordial Pagoda, Qi Bitian puckered her lips, “Isn’t it just a Domain of the sword? Is there any reason to be so shocked? He really knows nothing!”

Lei Lin took a big bite of Lightning Essence by Qi Bitian’s side and asked, “Big Sis, was that fellow stronger or is Big Brother Yang stronger?”

Qi Bitian rubbed Lei Lin’s head, “What do you think?”

Lei Lin replied seriously, “I think Big Brother Yang is the strongest!”

Qi Bitian grinned, “Then he is the strongest!”

Outside the Primordial Pagoda.

Yang Ye was still stunned on the spot. He was truly too shocked by what he’d just witnessed!

The sword!

A Domain formed with the sword!

Simply speaking, the sword was the Domain, and it was completely different than his independent Domain.

Yang Ye was surprised that it was possible!

Actually, he really wanted to seek guidance from Qi Bitian. Unfortunately, the Primordial Pagoda was locked away, so he couldn’t get in or communicate with Qi Bitian who was within it!

He could only rely on himself!

Meanwhile, the voice resounded again, “Please take your leave!”

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and asked, “May I know if that sword cultivator from before is still alive?”

The voice remained silent for a short while before replying, “If someone asks about you in the future, are you willing to let us reveal information about you?”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and nodded, “Alright!”

The voice stated, “That sword cultivator is from 90,000 years ago.”

90,000 years!

Yang Ye fell silent. That era was probably around the time of Wu Ni and the others, and it may be from the same era as Qi Bitian!

It was an extremely old existence!

Yang Ye didn’t ask more and just left.

A short while later, Yang Ye returned to the hall. He closed his eyes while the sword cultivator’s attack from just now was still replaying in his mind.

The Sword Domain!

What was the Sword Domain?

Actually, he’d never been able to give a proper answer to that question. Because there were truly few who possessed it. In the past, while his Sword Domain couldn’t be described as being completely useless, its benefits weren’t very obvious. It was merely capable of enhancing his strength!

It enhanced his sword techniques, flying swords, and kept him hidden!

But just now, he’d seen that the Sword Domain wasn’t like that at all. It wasn’t a form of enhancement, it was a form of strength!

A short while later, Jian Bei appeared before Yang Ye. He sized up Yang Ye and asked, “How was it?”

Yang Ye nodded slightly, “Not bad. Is there a place to cultivate here?”

Jian Bei smiled, “Of course.” 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

As he spoke, he led Yang Ye away. A short while later, they arrived before a hall, and within the hall, Yang Ye arrived at an expanse of the void.

Jian Bei’s voice resounded in his mind, “This is an independent space, and no one will disturb you here. However, you only have three days. Because renting a space to cultivate here is extremely expensive.”

Yang Ye cupped his fist, “Thank you!”

He glanced at the surroundings and sat down cross-legged.

Comprehend!

Cultivation wasn’t just cultivating energy, it required meditation, and that was comprehension.

Just like how it was quite unrealistic for an ordinary person to become rich by just hard work alone. Because besides that, the person had to think, plan, have a goal…

It was the same for cultivating!

The scene he witnessed earlier was ceaselessly replaying in Yang Ye’s mind!

Yang Ye was still a newcomer in the path of the sword. At the very least, he thought of himself as a newcomer. Thus, so long as he had the chance, he was willing to learn anything useful to him!

The Sword Domain! A Domain formed from the sword!

Just like that, around six hours passed before Yang Ye suddenly stood up, and then an intent sword appeared in his grasp!

As he gazed at it, Yang Ye’s face gradually turned solemn, and the space around him started to tremble.

The Sword Domain Sphere!

The Sword Domain Sphere was compressing sword energy and sword intent within the Sword Domain, and then ceaselessly compressing them until they underwent a qualitative change. Now, he planned to compress it onto his sword!

He wanted to make a Domain of the sword!

They were similar but different!

Of course, there was another similarity between them, and it was that they were extremely difficult to accomplish!

Yang Ye’s body was shaking while his intent sword trembled violently as well. Besides that, cold sweat was ceaselessly running down his face.

Just like that, around 15 minutes passed…

Boom!

The intent sword exploded apart, and along with it, another type of invisible force exploded apart. It instantly blasted Yang Ye extremely far away!

Fortunately, the cultivation room was simply boundless!

Yang Ye laid there in space while blood flowed incessantly from his right arm.

In the Primordial Pagoda, Qi Bitian seemed quite disappointed in Yang Ye, “That idiot! Doesn’t he know how to think of it from a different angle? The Sword Domain, a Domain of the sword. You are linked to your Sword Heart, and it is formed from sword intent, so it’s part of you. So, why forcefully shrink it and strengthen it? It can form a Sword Domain of its own. You fool! It’s like taking off your pants to fart!”

Lei Lin blinked, “Big Sis, what does taking off your pants to fart mean?”

Qi Bitian replied angrily, “It’s something unnecessary. He’s a huge idiot!”

Meanwhile, Lei Lin turned around and ran away. But it didn’t take long for Qi Bitian to stop her.

Qi Bitian gazed at Lei Lin, “What are you doing?”

She spoke in a melodious voice, “I’m going to tell big brother about it!”

Qi Bitian spoke indifferently, “No, he has to comprehend it himself.”

Lei Lin was very puzzled, “Why?”

Qi Bitian shook her head, “If you tell him, his comprehension won’t be that deep. Moreover, if he obtains it too easily, he won’t gain a good understanding of it, and he won’t cherish it that much. He must cherish everything he obtains.”

As she spoke, she glanced at Yang Ye and said, “What comes easy is never cherished.”

Lei Lin blinked. She didn’t really understand, but she was well aware that she couldn’t go outside.

Qi Bitian was the strongest in the pagoda right now. Even the pagoda itself had to be obedient, and if it didn’t listen to her, it would suffer. The Primordial Pagoda had tried to heal Yang Ye previously, and then Qi Bitian grabbed it and kicked it off into the distance… Moreover, she didn’t just do it once, she kicked it over 100 times!

After that, the Primordial Pagoda ‘didn’t recognize’ Yang Ye anymore.

Qi Bitian glanced at Yang Ye. At this moment, he’d clearly suffered quite a bit of backlash, and his entire body was twitching. It was especially so for his right hand. It had almost been blasted into bits!

Backlash from the explosion of the Sword Domain!

It was truly an act of self-harm!

Lei Lin couldn’t really bear to watch. She wanted to beg for help on Yang Ye’s behalf, but Qi Bitian seemed to know what she intended to do and rubbed her head, “If he doesn’t bleed a little now and learn what pain is, others will take his life in the future.”

She shot a glance into the sky and spoke softly, “If I don’t teach him how cruel this world is, he’ll pay with his life to learn it from someone else.”

Lei Lin lowered her head slightly and spoke softly, “B-But what if big brother dies…?”

Qi Bitian grinned, “Dying at my hands is better than dying at the hands of another. At the very least, I’ll bury him and take care of all of you.”

She rubbed Lei Lin’s—who was unhappy—head and smiled, “Silly girl, this is nothing compared to what I experienced all those years ago! Let me tell you a secret, I once stayed in a pitch-black place for an entire 36 years. At that place, there was no spirit energy, no sunlight, and no food. I ate people to survive all that time. Do you know why I’m so small? It’s because I ate my original body. I didn’t want to return to how I used to look, so I remained small like this!”
