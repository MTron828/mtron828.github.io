Chapter 2737 – Either Attack Me or Shut Up!

Yang Ye shook his head, “Focus!”

Snowy nodded, and then she put the gourd away. After that, she gazed at the huge dragon head.

A spirit vein!

A huge spirit vein!

Snowy blinked! She felt that the big fellow before her should be brought into the Primordial Pagoda!

Snowy had made such a decision at first sight of the huge dragon!

She waved the Sprite Staff swiftly, and it took just a moment for the spirit energy within the formation to be completely taken away. As for the golden rope around the dragon, it started to turn ethereal.

The black robed man suddenly chuckled, “Yang Ye, I didn’t expect you to dare to show yourself here. Looks like you’re very confident in yourself!”

Yang Ye gazed at him, “Either attack me or shut up.”

The black robed man laughed fiercely, “Yang Ye, open your eyes and look around you.”

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings.

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!

The space around him started to crack open.

An ambush!

Obviously, they had expected him to come.

The black robed man chuckled, “Yang Ye! Oh, Yang Ye! If you didn’t come, we would be helpless against you, but you just had to come. See the barrier around us? The space here has been fortified by a supreme technique. Isn’t your Sprite Progenitor amazing? Why don’t you ask her to try and destroy it? You…”

He suddenly stopped speaking at this point.

Because a ray of sword energy shot toward him!

The black robed man’s expression changed slightly. He clenched his right fist and slammed it forward, causing a wave of energy to condense into a shield before him.

Defense!

Yang Ye’s attacks were too powerful and going head-on against it would be a terrible idea!

Yang Ye’s attack arrived!

Boom!

The energy shield exploded apart and the black robed man was instantly blasted over 3km away.

The black robed figures around him were just about to attack when Yang Ye swung his sword horizontally, and a wave of powerful sword intent rippled out. Those experts hadn’t even been able to attack before they were pushed back repeatedly!

Yang Ye didn’t attack again and just returned to Snowy’s side.

The little fellow was most important to him!

Meanwhile, Huang Ying and the other experts from all over the universe gazed at Yang Ye and the black robed figures in silence.

All of them had solemn expressions on their faces.

It was because Yang Ye was much stronger than before.

A short while later, Huang Ying suddenly said, “There’s no need to think too much about it. His increase in strength isn’t a bad thing for us. We don’t have any direct conflicts of interest with him. The End World would be fearful while he is alive, and that’s a good thing for us!”

The others seemed slightly relieved upon hearing this.

Just as Huang Ying had said, having Yang Ye keep the End World busy was a good thing for the desolate race. If they didn’t have Yang Ye, the End World would be the greatest superpower, and that was very likely to be a calamity for them.

Meanwhile, the golden threads around the huge dragon were vanishing rapidly with Snowy’s help.

Yang Ye didn’t do anything because those threads had entered the huge dragon’s body. His sword could destroy those threads, but it may harm the dragon too. Moreover, he had to deter the black robed men in the distance.

Similarly, the black robed men didn’t attack.

The last collision had clearly shown them the gap between them and Yang Ye!

If they attacked now, it would be no different than courting death.

Since they didn’t attack, Yang Ye didn’t either.

A short while later, the golden threads around the huge dragon had been completely expelled by Snowy. She cracked a smile, and then started waving her paws at the divine vein.

Everyone knew what she was doing!

Huang Ying and the others’ expressions instantly turned unsightly.

Obviously, Snowy was tricking the divine vein to leave with her!

The others by Huang Ying’s side had clearly realized that, and their expressions had instantly turned extremely unsightly. If the divine vein went with the little fellow…

Suddenly, something unexpected occurred.

Rumble!

The ground within the barrier shook violently, and then a huge mountain suddenly collapsed. A moment later, a towering titan emerged from beneath the mountain!

The titan’s entire body was made of pitch black rocks, and the world seemed so tiny before it.

It was truly too huge!

Snowy glanced at it, and then she hurriedly gazed at the huge dragon and waved her paws swiftly.

Obviously, she was telling the dragon to leave with her!

The dragon gazed at Snowy for a long time. In the end, it gazed at Yang Ye, “Human?”

Yang Ye glanced at the dragon and nodded slightly, “What?”

The dragon spoke solemnly, “If I go with you, the spirit energy here will start to disperse, and this world will collapse in 10 years at most.”

Yang Ye replied indifferently, “You want to stay?”

The dragon shook its head, “Human, you’re very strong. Are you willing to protect me and this world?”

Yang Ye was slightly stunned and decisively shook his head, “If you refuse to leave, we will leave.”

He'd come to save the spirit vein because of Snowy, but if it refused to leave, he would take Snowy and leave. Not only did he have to save it, he had to protect it too? He wasn’t that free!

He had a lot of things to deal with, and he could only fight the End World because he was free to go anywhere he wanted now. But if he had to protect this divine vein, he would be trapped here, and he would probably never have a day of peace from then on.

The divine vein fell silent.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye added, “I’ll give you 10 breaths of time to consider if you’re staying or leaving.”

The titan was already walking in Yang Ye’s direction. Every step it took caused the world to tremble, crack open, and sink down.

Its terrifying pressure and aura was something that even a peak Destiny Realm expert couldn’t compete with!

Yang Ye gazed at it calmly. Snowy had returned to his shoulder. She glanced at the divine vein and didn’t wave her paws anymore.

She’d come here to save it, but if it didn’t want to go with her, then she couldn’t do anything either!

Moreover, just coming here was very dangerous for them.

The titan was getting closer and closer.

Meanwhile, the divine vein suddenly looked up into the sky where Huang Ying and the others were, “Humans, demons, and all the other races of the universe, would you be willing to protect me if I stay?”

All of them had gloomy expressions on their faces and remained silent.

The divine vein clearly wanted to stay here, but the problem was that someone wanted to harm it, and it would be willing to stay with whoever was willing to protect it!

A few breaths of time passed, but Huang Ying and the others remained silent.

Protect the divine vein?

The black robed man’s group was very likely to be from the End World, so how would they protect the divine veins?

They wanted to protect it and keep it here, but they really couldn’t.

They didn’t dare to go against the End World!

The divine vein moved its gaze away from them, and some time passed before it gazed at Yang Ye and Snowy, “I’ll go with you!”

Snowy cracked a smile to display that it was welcome to go with them.

The dragon gazed at Yang Ye, “Help me buy 15 minutes of time to leave this place.”

Yang Ye nodded, “Alright!”

The divine vein closed its eyes slowly, and then its body throughout Eternal Kingdom started to move. At the same time, the ground throughout Eternal Kingdom trembled violently.

Countless mountains collapsed and the ground cracked open!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye sent Snowy into the Primordial Pagoda. His figure transformed into an arc of sword energy that shot toward the titan!

At this moment, he had to attack because the titan was already in front of him.

The titan suddenly slammed a punch at him!

It was like the sky was collapsing, and it was extremely terrifying!

Bam!

The sword energy dispersed, and a figure was blasted away.

It was Yang Ye’s figure!

Yang Ye stomped his right foot down and forced himself to a stop.

Meanwhile, the black robed man suddenly laughed coldly, “Yang Ye, that’s…”

Yang Ye suddenly glanced at him and said, “It’s your grandfather! Just shut the fuck up!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he sheathed his sword and dashed at the titan!

His speed rose rapidly, and it was so fast that material afterimages appeared!

Countless watched as Yang Ye suddenly appeared above the titan!

He swung his sword!

Explosive Heavenrend!

The world cracked open before this attack!

The titan raised its arms and crossed them above itself.

However, at the instant the attack descended, the arms were slashed off, and the sword didn’t stop at all as it slashed down.

An instant later, Yang Ye descended by the feet of the titan.

A moment of silence ensued, and then the titan suddenly split into two and fell to the ground!

Everyone was stunned by this scene.

One attack!

It was killed with just one attack?

Yang Ye put his sword away. Meanwhile, the divine vein suddenly shot up into the air, and then the entire Eternal Kingdom started shaking.

The divine vein grew smaller and smaller before them.Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

It was shrinking!

Yang Ye gazed coldly at the black robed man’s group. He had an indifferent expression on his face and was just watching.

If any one of them dared to attack, they would die!

A short while later, the divine vein grew smaller and smaller, and anywhere it vanished from Eternal Kingdom, the spirit energy there instantly decreased rapidly.

As for those areas with scarce spirit energy, the spirit energy there started to dry up instead.

A long time passed before the divine vein suddenly charged at Yang Ye.

A moment later, it entered Yang Ye’s body, or the Primordial Pagoda to be precise!

“Haha…” Meanwhile, the black robed man suddenly started roaring with laughter, “Yang Ye! Oh, Yang Ye! Do you realize that you’ve destroyed Eternal Kingdom, and you’ll become the public enemy of the entire Eternal Kingdom? Haha!”

As soon as he finished speaking, the barrier around them vanished, and the black robed man’s group retreated.

A conspiracy!

It was a trap they’d set for him and intentionally forced him to save the divine vein!
