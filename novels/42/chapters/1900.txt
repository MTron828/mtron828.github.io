Chapter 1901 – Northern Sky City!

At this moment, Yang Ye was very angry.

There was no enmity between him and the Shaman Hunters, but she wanted to kill him just because he had the shaman race’s bloodline!

She wanted to kill him!

That was absolutely overbearing!

The Shaman Hunters were absolutely overbearing!

Yang Ye had no burdens in the upper universe because all his loved ones were in the Primordial Pagoda. It could be said that he had nothing to worry about. As for what Hou Qing told him about retreating for now, he’d done that just now, but what did he get in return? They refused to let him go!

The facts proved that retreating would only make them take things further!

Nansi Yin blinked when she witnessed this and asked, “You’re not really thinking about killing someone from the Shaman Hunter Clan, right?”

Yang Ye didn’t say anything. A ray of light flashed below his feet, and then he was in the sky.

The woman he severed an arm from was in front of him, and there was a middle aged man by her side.

The middle aged man wore a black robe, and he held a black pike just like the woman. However, his pike was slightly longer.

The middle aged man sized up Yang Ye and said, “As a human, you possess the bloodline of the shaman race and have cultivated their techniques. You’re really fallen. You…”

Yang Ye suddenly raised his right hand and interrupted the middle aged man. He looked the middle aged man in the eyes and said, “What I cultivate is none of your fucking business!”

The atmosphere here instantly became tense.

A wisp of ghastly coldness flashed through the man’s eyes, “Looks like you’re very confident. But that’s fine, you won’t be so confident very soon…”

Suddenly, Yang Ye took a step forward.

The Sword Domain swept out!

The woman’s expression changed, and she hurriedly warned, “Be careful!”

However, Yang Ye was already in front of the middle aged man, and then he drew his sword and swung it!

80 overlapped Heavenrends!

It was Yang Ye’s limit!

The world around them dimmed down before Yang Ye’s attack!

At the same instant, the middle aged man’s expression changed drastically while astonishment filled his eyes. At this moment, he realized that he’d underestimated his opponent a little. Actually, it wasn’t just a little, he’d underestimated his opponent severely.

He hastily raised the pike in his hand to block Yang Ye’s attack.

Crack!

Bang!

Along with a cracking sound, Nansi Yin watched with shock as the middle aged man was blasted extremely far away. The pike was still there where the middle aged man had been standing moments ago, but the pike was in two halves now.

That was how terrifying his attack had been!

Nansi Yin glanced at Yang Ye and spoke softly, “This fellow is that strong…”

The battle hadn’t come to an end yet. After he blasted the middle aged man back, Yang Ye waved his hands. In an instant, ten ethereal swords appeared around the middle aged man, and then rays of light crisscrossed towards him!

The reason Yang Ye hadn’t chased after the middle aged man himself was that the woman had suddenly appeared before him once he blasted the middle aged man away, and her pike stabbed towards his forehead.

A vicious glow flashed through his eyes as he gazed at her.

He stomped his right foot down and shot forward.

Split Second!

They were extremely close, so how terrifying would the explosive force created by his technique be?

Boom!

An explosion resounded, and the woman was blasted far away. As soon as she stopped herself, she spat out a few mouthfuls of blood. Meanwhile, Yang Ye appeared in front of her again, and then a ray of light slashed down towards her!

Bang!

The woman was fine, and it was Yang Ye’s sword energy that was dispersed instead.

At the same time, Yang Ye returned to where he’d been standing a little while ago.

Because that black bird had appeared in front of her again. At this moment, it was staring at Yang Ye, and its eyes were filled with viciousness and a trace of fear.

It didn’t dare to attack again, this time. It just protected the woman and told her to retreat.

Danger!

It sensed danger!

The woman understood the bird, but she was quite hesitant. However, Yang Ye didn’t hesitate. A moment later, he appeared before the bird, and then a ray of dazzling light slashed down towards it!

Viciousness flashed through the black bird’s eyes, and it let out a long cry before slamming itself in Yang Ye’s direction.

Bang!

An instant later, the bird was blasted flying, and some parts of its body had cracked open.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye vanished on the spot.

The woman’s eyelids twitched at the sight of this, and she was about to counterattack. However, it only took a moment for her expression to change drastically, and she gazed at the middle aged man who was fighting Yang Ye’s ethereal swords, “Watch out!”

But it was too late.

“AH!” A shrill and miserable cry resounded, and then a bloody head shot up into the air.

It was the middle aged man’s head.

The surroundings instantly became deathly silent at this point.

Nansi Yin gazed at that head, and then touched her own neck. Now, she felt quite a bit of fear.

Because she’d realized that the man she’d been following was absolutely fearless. If she hadn’t given in when Yang Ye had his hand around her throat, she would be dead by now!

He even dared to kill a Shaman Hunter!

Nansi Yin stared at Yang Ye while curiosity filled her heart. Who is he?

Yang Ye glanced at the head, and then he gazed at the woman. He was about to attack when she suddenly appeared on the bird, and then they transformed into a ray of black light that vanished from Yang Ye’s field of vision.

They’d fled!

Extremely swiftly too!

Yang Ye didn’t go after them. Because he couldn’t. They were too fast, so it would take at least a few days and nights for him to catch up.

Yang Ye withdrew his gaze, turned around, and an ethereal sword soundlessly appeared below his feet.

A moment later, Yang Ye vanished into the sky.

Nansi Yin hesitated for a moment and followed after him.

Nansi Yin asked, “Do you know what the Shaman Hunter Clan represents?”

Yang Ye glanced at her, “What are you trying to say?”

Nansi Yin hesitated for a moment and said, “The Shaman Hunter Clan is extremely strong. Even the Sovereign of Man wouldn’t rashly offend them. Yet you… you killed one of them, possess the bloodline of the Shaman Race, and have cultivated the cultivation techniques of the shaman race. They’ll never let you go!”

Yang Ye chuckled, “Do you know the Shaman Progenitor?”

Nansi Yin replied, “Of course!”

Yang Ye said, “If they’re that strong, why don’t they kill the Shaman Progenitor?”

Nansi Yin was at a loss for words.

Yang Ye said, “See? They’re just some fellows who only bully the weak but fear the strong. Because they know that if they kill the Shaman Progenitor and the top experts of the shaman race, then the shaman race would be finished. However, they dare not do that. Right?”

Nansi Yin hesitated for a moment and said, “But… but even if that’s true, you’re still a weakling to them. Moreover, you don’t possess the Shaman Progenitor’s strength!”

Yang Ye suddenly asked, “Then what do you think I should do?”

Nansi Yin was speechless again.

Yang Ye smiled, “Flee? Do you think they would let me? That’s clearly impossible. In any case, they won’t let me go now. So, why should I spare them? Killing one makes us even, and two is a gain for me. But if I don’t kill them, wouldn’t it be a complete loss if I were to be killed by them?”

Nansi Yin thought for a moment and said, “That does sound right… But… Sigh, you’re in big trouble.”

Yang Ye suddenly stopped and looked up into the distance. There was a city there.

It was huge!

It was an extremely huge city. Even when looking down at it from the sky, it was still impossible to see the end of it.

Nansi Yin suddenly said, “That’s Northern Sky City!”

Yang Ye nodded, “Let’s go down there!”

They descended to the ground. They felt tiny as they stood before the city. It was like they were standing in the boundless starry sky and facing the universe.

Because Northern Sky City was truly too huge. Just the city walls stretched for over 1km upwards. What was that like? It was like an ant standing before an elephant.

“It’s magnificent, right?” Nansi Yin smiled, “This isn’t the largest city in the Human Dimension. The largest is the capital in the Central Prefecture.”

Yang Ye glanced at the thick city walls, “It’s used to stop the shaman race?”

Nansi Yin nodded, “Once its formations are activated, even experts above the Enlightened Realm wouldn’t be able to shake it. Besides that, it has extremely powerful lethal attacks!”

Yang Ye gazed at her, “Attacks?”

Nansi Yin blinked, “Attacks? I didn’t say anything!”

Yang Ye didn’t pursue an answer, and he turned to look at the city. Needless to say, they were really tiny before the city. Even he would find it difficult to break through the city walls with a single attack; even if he succeeded, it would probably be nothing to the city.

They were about to enter the city when they suddenly stopped at the same time and turned around. There was a colossus not too far away from them.Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

A dragon!

A black dragon that was very long, and there was a small palace on its back. The palace was beautifully decorated, and it seemed extraordinarily luxurious.
