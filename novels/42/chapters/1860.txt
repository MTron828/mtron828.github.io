Chapter 1861 – Indefinite Slumber!

Ant!

At this moment, the Night Emperor was still in shock. Who was the red robed old man? One of the four Heavenly Exalts of Heaven Pillar Mountain. His strength could be described as being at the peak of this world.

Yet now, he’d been pushed back with ease, and he’d even been called an ant!

Ant!

If the four Heavenly Exalts were ants…

The Night Emperor ignored the red robed man and looked towards Yang Ye. A woman in a violet dress was standing before Yang Ye. She seemed to be around the age of 17 or 18. She had a cold and aloof expression, like a goddess from the nine heavens, causing others to dare not look her in the eyes!

Suddenly, the red robed man spoke solemnly, “Who are you?!”

At this moment, he was extremely shocked. Because he’d never imagined that someone would be able to casually push him back.

The woman paid no attention to the red robed man, and she turned to look at Yang Ye. At this moment, Yang Ye was looking at her as well. He was stunned when he saw her appearance, “Zi’er… You…”

It was Zi’er!

However, it only took a moment for Yang Ye’s expression to change, “You’re not Zi’er!”

Even though she had Zi’er’s appearance, her expression was too icy cold and proud. Zi’er would never look at him like this!

She sized up Yang Ye and said, “I didn’t expect you to still be so weak after so long! Hmph!” Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Yang Ye was stunned, and then he spoke with astonishment, “You… you’re not Zi’er, you’re… you’re Xiao Qi!”

‘Zi’er’ glanced indifferently at Yang Ye and remained silent.

Xiao Qi!

He naturally hadn’t forgotten her. She’d come with the Primordial Pagoda, and she’d fallen into deep sleep after saving his life. So, he was extremely happy to see her awake.

But it didn’t take long for him to think of another issue.

Yang Ye gazed at her, “Xiao Qi, you… You and Zi’er… Both of you…”

She remained silent for quite some time before she said, “I’ve entered her body!”

Yang Ye asked, “Then what about her?”

Xiao Qi replied, “Indefinite sleep!”

Indefinite sleep!

These words were like a thunderclap to Yang Ye, causing his body to stiffen on the spot. A short while passed before he grabbed her hand, “Xiao Qi, what do you mean by indefinite sleep?”

She glanced at Yang Ye and replied, “My soul is very weak, and it’s utterly incapable of leaving the pagoda. The only way is to rely on someone else’s body. Only then can I leave the pagoda and use my strength. But she was too weak, so while I didn’t try to harm her upon entering her body, her consciousness still was incapable of enduring the strength of my soul. So, she fell into an indefinite sleep.”

Yang Ye suddenly roared with fury, “Why did you enter her body?!”

Xiao Qi suddenly looked up at Yang Ye and spoke angrily, “Why are you shouting at me? I entered her body to help you!”

Yang Ye took a deep breath and worked hard to calm himself, “Immediately… immediately leave her body. She…”

Xiao Qi spoke coldly, “It’s too late!”

Yang Ye’s face was instantly covered in ferocity, and he just gazed at her in silence.

Suddenly, the red robed man suddenly said, “Who are you?!”

Suddenly, Xiao Qi gazed at him, and then a blue scepter appeared in her grasp. A moment later, a ray of dazzling blue light shot out from it. The red robed man’s expression changed when he saw the blue light.

His reaction was extremely quick. He immediately formed a strange seal with his right hand, and then layers of red light rippled from the seal and swept out.

Boom!

As soon as their attacks collided, the red light was dispersed, and the red robed man was blasted over 10km away!

The Night Emperor was horrified by the sight of this. Who is this little girl! She’s so strong!

Xiao Qi didn’t launch another attack, and she turned to look at Yang Ye, “Remember that this was her own choice!”

As soon as she finished speaking, she looked up at Heaven Pillar Mountain, “Stupid Dragon! Get out here!”

As soon as she said that, the entire mountain shook. At this moment, all the experts throughout Heaven Pillar Mountain simultaneously looked up at the mountain.

There were three Ancient Cultivators, four Heavenly Exalts, and five Emperors in Heaven Pillar Mountain. However, all of them weren’t the most terrifying existence here. The most terrifying existence here was the dragon coiled around the mountain! As far as everyone was concerned, that dragon was the most terrifying existence!

Even the three Ancient Cultivators didn’t dare to rashly offend it!

Everyone watched as the mountain trembled more and more, and then a huge dragon head flashed out from above and appeared in the sky. It completely blotted out half the sky!

The black dragon’s gaze swept the surroundings, and then it locked onto the area where Yang Ye and the others were. Or to be more precise, it was on Xiao Qi. As soon as he saw Xiao Qi’ the dragon’s cold and indifferent eyes were filled with excitement and happiness.

Roar!

Suddenly, a dragon roar resounded through the sky. In an instant, the minds of countless were in a daze, and their ears felt like they had cracked open. Even the Night Emperor frowned because the dragon roar made him feel very uncomfortable!

“Enough!” Suddenly, Xiao Qi shouted angrily, “Hurry! Send me up there!”

Meanwhile, the black dragon lowered his head. At this moment, his head was less than 300m away from Yang Ye and the others, and they could hear his breathing clearly.

The black dragon gazed at Xiao Qi and said, “Where have you been all these years? Do you know how I suffered? In this damnable place. I…”

Xiao Qi suddenly spoke coldly, “It’s your fault for being slow and getting caught!”

“Come on!” The black dragon’s voice was quite anxious, “No matter how fast I am, can I beat your father? Can I beat the Dao Progenitor? Not to mention them, I can’t even outrun your brothers. You were only faster because that thing was helping you. Otherwise…”

Xiao Qi suddenly waved her hand, “Forget about that. I’m in a hurry, so send me home right now!”

The black dragon shook his head, “It isn’t that easy to go up there anymore. The barrier has been strengthened, so I…”

Xiao Qi spoke indifferently, “If I don’t go up there, how will I speak on your behalf to my father? If I don’t do that, who knows how long you’ll be imprisoned here, right? So….”

“Alright, let’s go! Let’s go right now!” The black dragon hurriedly said, “Come! Get on! I’ll get someone to help me!”

Xiao Qi didn’t say anything and just flew up on his head. Countless experts, who were watching from the shadows, were shocked by this scene. Dragons were extremely proud beings, and this one was a black dragon from the large universe, so he was absolutely proud. Yet now, that little girl was actually standing on his head!

However, to everyone’s surprise, the black dragon wasn’t infuriated by it, and he seemed to be used to it!

Who is she?

Everyone was looking at Xiao Qi with extreme curiosity in their hearts.

The black dragon was about to leave when Xiao Qi seemed to have thought of something, and she suddenly looked at the red robed man, “I can’t stand the sight of him! Kill him!”

The red robed man’s expression changed drastically, and then he immediately fled without any hesitation. In just an instant, he was extremely far away and on the verge of escaping Heaven Pillar Mountain.

The red robed man’s plan was to escape Heaven Pillar Mountain. Because he knew that the black dragon couldn’t leave. So long as he escaped the area, he would be safe. As for fighting back, he’d never thought about that. Because not to mention him, even the three Ancient Cultivators wouldn’t dare to look for trouble with this dragon!

Right when the red robed man was about to cross the border of Heaven Pillar Mountain, a huge dragon tail flashed down from the sky. It blotted out the entire sky as it swept down because it was truly too huge.

However, it only lasted for an instant! Because the tail was extremely swift!

The red robed man was about to vanish when the dragon tail arrived.

His face was instantly covered with ferocity when he saw the tail. At this moment, he was naturally aware that he would be able to escape, and he had to go head on against it!

He waved his hands. In an instant, countless rays of red light swept out from him. They seemed like a tornado as they surged towards the tail. However, as soon as it came into contact with the dragon tail, it was obliterated in an instant.

As for the red robed man, his body was shattered by the force within the tail, but his soul instantly transformed into a ray of black light that vanished into the sky. Or to be more precise, he’d abandoned his body upon executing that attack. His speed was even faster when his soul wasn’t tied down by his body!

The black dragon frowned, “His soul escaped! Now that he’s out of Heaven Pillar Mountain, I can’t do anything about him.”

Xiao Qi nodded lightly, “Let’s go!”

The black dragon was about to leave when Xiao Qi seemed to have thought of something. She looked down at Yang Ye and said, “Remember that you owe me an apology!”

He tapped the dragon’s head with her foot once she finished speaking.

An instant later, the dragon vanished into the sky.
