Chapter 2061 – Stellar Map of the Universe!

Their plan was to attack together and break open a gap in the mysterious ruins.

All of the others had no objections towards that idea.

The top!

They’d chosen the top of the ruins as their path in. Over a dozen extraordinary experts arrived in the sky above the mysterious ruins, and when looking at it from high above, the mysterious ruins seemed like a huge plate.

Han Yi spoke while standing before all of them, “Everyone, it’s risky, so does anyone want to withdraw?”

They shook their heads. How could they possibly withdraw at a time like this?

If they tried, it may change their lives.

Han Yi nodded slightly, “Let’s attack it together!”

As soon as he finished speaking, the spear on his back shook violently, and then it transformed into a ray of light that shot downwards.

At the same time, the others attack as well.

Rays of light shot down from the sky and slammed against the top of the mysterious ruins.

Boom!

The top of the ruins exploded open, and a huge hole appeared before them.

All of them exchanged glances, but none dared to go in.

Meanwhile, Han Yi suddenly said, “Let’s go down there together!”

They nodded to display that they had no objections.

A moment later, all of them shot into the ruins.

Darkness!

An expanse of darkness!

As soon as they entered the ruins, only darkness greeted them, and they couldn’t see anything with their eyes.

Extreme vigilance covered all their faces.

Hiss!

Suddenly, a ball of flames arose here. As soon as the flames appeared, they were able to see the surroundings. Pitch black walls covered the surroundings, and there were strange pictures drawn on them.

“What are these?” Li Shui’shui spoke softly while standing by Yang Ye’s side, “It looks like a starry sky!”

Yang Ye gazed at the walls. Sure enough, it was just as she said. It was like numerous expanses of outer space drawn on the walls.

“Look!” Li Shui’shui pointed at the walls, “Every single one of them is a different expanse of outer space.”

Because the mysterious ruins were extremely huge, the walls around them were huge too. Every single wall was at least 100m tall and 30m wide. Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings, and he noticed that there were at least 100 expanses of outer space drawn on the walls!

What are all of these?

The same question had appeared in all their minds.

Li Shui’shui’s eyes suddenly opened wide as she seemed to have discovered a secret. The others noticed the unusual change in her expression, so they gazed at her. At the same time, Han Yi smiled, “Little girl, have you noticed something?”

Li Shui’shui’s eyes rolled about. Suddenly, Yang Ye spoke solemnly, “If you’ve noticed something, then tell us!”

Li Shui’shui clearly intended to play some tricks. But if she did that, she would definitely die. After all, was anyone here a weakling? It would be fine if she was strong. Unfortunately, Wo You and her could be described as the weakest in their group.

It was even to the extent that if it wasn’t for Yang Ye, Han Yi wouldn’t have even invited them into the group.

Wo You spoke solemnly as well, “Tell us about it!”

Obviously, she’d thought of more than what Li Shui’shui had considered.

Han Yi glanced at Yang Ye and Wo You, and then he smiled. After that, he gazed at Li Shui’shui.

Meanwhile, Li Shui’shui seemed to have realized something, and she stopped trying to play tricks. She pointed at the pictures on the walls and said, “Seniors, take a look at them. Is there something unusual about them?”

All of them gazed at the pictures, but bewilderment still filled their eyes.

Han Yi gazed at Li Shui’shui and smiled, “Little girl, stop beating around the bush. We’re all getting anxious. So be frank!”

Li Shui’shui nodded, “I’ve seen the map of our large universe in Martial Emperor Academy’s library. Experts once used their supreme strength to form a miniature of our large universe.”

She pointed at the picture in the distance, “That’s our large universe!”

Everyone gazed at the picture she pointed at, and so did Yang Ye.

Shocked!

They were extremely shocked!

If Li Shui’shui was telling the truth, then all of the other pictures were stellar maps, so didn’t that mean that there were countless other universes like this large universe they were in? Moreover, some of the stellar maps were even larger than the stellar map of their large universe!

There were too many here!

Suddenly, one of them said, “There’s a passageway down there!”

Everyone here was pulled out of their thoughts and looked towards the passageway. It was an expanse of pitch black, so they couldn’t see anything in there at all.

Someone asked, “Are we going down there?”

Han Yi spoke solemnly, “Of course. Otherwise, wouldn’t we have done all of this for nothing?”

Someone asked, “Who’s going first?”

Han Yi glanced at the person who asked that question, “Everyone, I’m very well aware that all of you want someone else to see if there’s danger down there while you just benefit. If all of you think like that, then it’s obvious that this trip of ours will end with all of us going home empty handed!”

He glanced at them and continued, “We’ll go down together. Anyone have any objections?”

Even though they had their own plans, they weren’t shortsighted people. So, they were naturally well aware that if they engaged in internal strife now, then it would obviously end just like how Han Yi had predicted. They would have to go home empty handed.

Even if they had to engage in internal strife, they could only do so after their group found an Originite or some other precious treasure!

Internal strife!

All of them knew very well that this alliance was only temporary.

Meanwhile, Li Shui’shui suddenly said, “What do we do with the pictures on those walls?”

All of them fell silent. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

They were very well aware that those pictures weren’t ordinary. They were the maps of countless universes. So, even if those maps were useless to them, the maps would definitely fetch a good price in the outside world. For example, the Martial Emperor Academy and the four paths would definitely want them.

Everyone gazed at Han Yi because he was their leader right now.

Han Yi thought for a while and replied, “Everyone, I suggest that we leave them there!”

Someone immediately asked, “Why?”

Han Yi glanced at that person, “You may be able to take it, but will you be alive to enjoy it? The four paths, Martial Emperor Academy, and those mysterious organizations are definitely aware of this ruin, and they’ll definitely find out about the stellar maps here. At that time, do you think they’ll let those maps escape their grasp? Or do you think that you’ll be able to escape their pursuit?”

That person’s lips twitched. Obviously, he was quite unwilling to just leave them.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye couldn’t help but glance at Han Yi. He’s quite extraordinary!

After all, Han Yi was able to think straight when facing such great temptation, and he didn’t even try to be hopeful. It was very rare for someone to possess such wisdom and mentality!

Meanwhile, Han Yi added, “I’m sure that the memory all of you possess is sufficient to remember all of these pictures, if you wanted to. Right?”

Their eyes lit up. Yeah, we can just commit all of them to memory! In that way, we’ll benefit while avoiding trouble!

All of them glanced at the surroundings and committed all the pictures to memory.

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings and committed them to memory too. It was a waste not to because they may come in handy in the future.

Around 15 minutes later, everyone had committed all the maps to memory.

“Let’s go!” As soon as he said that, Han Yi started floating down slowly.

All of the others followed closely behind him.

A ball of flames descended along with them. It didn’t take long for them to sense a strand of cold energy, and they grew even more vigilant.

Thump!

They’d finally reached the ground.

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings. The light from the flames couldn’t stretch far into the surroundings, so they were merely able to see the people around them.

Crack!

Suddenly, a clear sound came from the side, and then it resounded once more. It didn’t take long for a ray of white light to appear far away from them.

A door!

They saw a door appear there!

They exchanged glances, and Han Yi spoke solemnly, “Be careful!”

They nodded and walked towards the door.

A sword soundlessly appeared in Yang Ye’s grasp. His instinct told him that something bad was about to happen.

Right when all of them were around 15m away from the door, an ear piercing screech came from it.

In an instant, their eardrums were shattered and blood instantly sprayed out of their ears. Yang Ye was in a comparatively better state because his body was sufficiently strong, and he’d been able to resist the ear piercing screech. However, it wasn’t comfortable for him either. It felt like needles were stabbing his head!

But that wasn’t the end of it. The head of someone near Yang Ye, the third person to Yang Ye’s right, had exploded apart, and blood and brain matter instantly sprayed all over. Once that person’s head exploded, another person’s head exploded before the others could even recover from their shock!

This sudden turn of events had caught all of them off guard. However, they reacted extremely swiftly, and immediately shot backwards. However, during this process, the heads of others were still exploding incessantly, causing blood and brain matter to spray without end.

It was an extremely bloody scene!

Suddenly, Yang Ye’s expression changed because he felt like his head was actually about to explode!

What the heck?!

Yang Ye was shocked, and he immediately raised his sword and swung it forward.

Hiss!

A ray of brilliant sword energy flashed.

A moment of silence ensued.

Suddenly!

Boom!

The surroundings shook violently like an earthquake was running through the area.

Yang Ye’s eyes opened wide while threads of blood filled them. Suddenly, a blood red hand pressed down on Yang Ye’s head.
