Chapter 2302 – Eternal Village!

A ray of light flashed through the night sky.

It tore through space as it descended.

However, the Primal Demon didn’t dodge at all, and it just allowed Yang Ye’s attack to strike it.

Hiss!

Dazzling sparks sprayed from atop it.

The ray of light dispersed, and so did the sparks.

The Primal Demon was completely unharmed!

Yang Ye floated in midair while holding his black sword tightly with both hands, and powerful madness intent coiled around him.

Meanwhile, the Primal Demon gazed at Yang Ye, and there was a trace of bewilderment in its eyes, “Sprite…”

Suddenly, Bai Zhixian appeared by Yang Ye’s side, and then she took his hand and fled.

When the Primal Demon reacted, Yang Ye and Bai Zhixian had already vanished into the night sky.

A wisp of viciousness flashed through the Primal Demon’s eyes, and it slammed its fist forward.

Bang!

In an instant, the area before it was obliterated.

However, the space within the secret realm was completely unharmed!

…

Bai Zhixian took Yang Ye along and dashed madly for almost two hours, and they finally stopped once they were certain that the Primal Demon hadn’t chased after them!

As soon as they stopped, Yang Ye fell to the ground.

At this moment, his entire body was covered in injuries. The Primal Demon’s punch had almost destroyed his entire body.

Bai Zhixian fell silent as she gazed at Yang Ye’s bloody body. If that punch had struck her, it was obvious that her body would have collapsed in an instant, and she may have even died! After all, Yang Ye’s attack had blocked off most of the Primal Demon’s attack, yet her body had still almost been destroyed.

As far as she was concerned, the Primal Demon was a True World Realm expert at the very least!

She restrained her thoughts, glanced at the surroundings, and then carried Yang Ye up and vanished on the spot.

Bai Zhixian waved her hand lightly before a mountain wall, and it cracked open before she flashed inside with Yang Ye.

In the cave.

Bai Zhixian placed Yang Ye on the ground. At this moment, the Primordial Violet Energy within him had started to automatically heal him.

As she gazed at Yang Ye, she suddenly stretched out her hand and placed it on Yang Ye’s face, “You even disregarded your life for the sake of a woman. You’re really foolish!”

“Hehe!” Suddenly, soft laughter came from outside the cave.

Bai Zhixian’s expression instantly changed drastically when she heard it. She turned around swiftly, and she saw a young girl standing at the entrance. The young girl wore a small linen dress with flower patterns on it, and she held a stick of Tanghulu in her grasp. At this moment, she was smiling as she gazed at Bai Zhixian.

Bai Zhixian spoke with vigilance on her face, “Who are you?”

The young girl chuckled, and then she pointed at Yang Ye, “Grandpa wants to see him.”

Bai Zhixian shook her head, “No.”

The young girl’s smile gradually became cold, and it became quite terrifying instead.

Bai Zhixian gradually clenched her fist. Suddenly, the young girl vanished on the spot, and Bai Zhixian’s pupils constricted. She unfurled her fist and slapped her palm forward. A wave of powerful force rippled out from her palm. However, a tiny fist pressed against her palm.

Bang!

Bai Zhixian was blasted away, and she slammed against the rock wall behind her.

As soon as she stood up, a mouthful of blood sprayed from her. She looked up at the young girl who was enjoying her Tanghulu, and disbelief filled Bai Zhixian’s eyes, “Your strength…”

The young girl puckered her lips, ignored Bai Zhixian, and walked over to Yang Ye before dragging one of Yang Ye’s legs out of the cave.

Outside the cave, a wave of powerful energy rippled at her from behind.

It was Bai Zhixian.

The young girl stopped, and then she turned around and slammed a punch forward.

Just this tiny fist blasted Bai Zhixian away. She was about to attack again when the young girl suddenly said, “I’ll kill you if you attack me again!”

She kicked Yang Ye’s leg lightly and said, “Grandpa wants to see him, not kill him. Why are you getting anxious?”

Bai Zhixian wiped off the blood on the corner of her mouth, “Why does your grandfather want to see him?”

The young girl shook her head, “I don’t know. If you want to know, you can come with me!”

Bai Zhixian glanced at her, and then she walked over to the young girl and carried Yang Ye in her arms, “Let’s go! I’ll go with you!”

The young girl glanced at her and said, “You won’t try to flee, right? I’m warning you now. I’ll kill you if you try to run away!”

Bai Zhixian replied, “I won’t. Moreover, I can’t, right?”

The young girl thought for a moment and nodded, “That is true. Alright, let’s go!”

As soon as she finished speaking, she started hopping off into the distance.

Bai Zhixian pondered deeply for a moment and followed the young girl while carrying Yang Ye with her.

Bai Zhixian followed the young girl deep into a mountain range, and a long time passed before Bai Zhixian suddenly stopped. It was because she saw a corpse before the opening in the mountain ahead.

It was a human corpse!

Moreover, there was a tiny ‘仙’ character on its chest.

An expert of the Immortal Estate!

Bai Zhixian’s expression instantly changed when she saw the corpse’s face, “Mei Geyu!”

Mei Geyu!

An extraordinarily dazzling genius of Eternal Border from many years ago, and he was one of the most outstanding monstrous geniuses of the Immortal Estate at that time. Besides that, he was ranked at the 4th of the Divine Rankings! After he attained the True World Realm all those years ago, he had never shown himself again. Everyone thought he was in closed door cultivation to advance further. But Bai Zhixian hadn’t expected him to have actually died here.

Meanwhile, the young girl suddenly asked, “You know him?”

Bai Zhixian glanced at the young girl and asked, “How did he die?”

The young girl licked her Tanghulu and replied, “He was killed by the Butcher. Seriously, the Butcher told him to leave, but he refused, and then…” She raised her hand and made a chopping motion, “The Butcher chopped him apart.”

Bai Zhixian was at a loss for words.

“Let’s go!” The young girl turned around and hopped off into the distance.

Bai Zhixian took a deep and long glance at the corpse, and then she followed the young girl. Once they entered the mountain, a village appeared before them.

At the entrance of the village was a wooden bench, and on it was a slovenly old man. The old man seemed to be sleeping there with a wine gourd hanging by his waist.

The young girl walked over to the wooden bench, pulled off one of the Tanghulu’s pieces and pushed it into the old man’s mouth. After that, she just ran into the village without looking back.

The old man cursed, “Wang Erya! You mad little girl! Don’t run away if you dare! You really need a good spanking!”

When Bai Zhixian arrived at the village entrance with Yang Ye, the old man glanced at them, and then he withdrew his gaze. However, it didn’t take long for him to gaze at Yang Ye, “What the heck?”

Bai Zhixian stopped and gazed at the old man. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

The old man sized up Yang Ye, and then he frowned, “Slaughter intent, sword intent, madness intent… Huh? These vengeful spirits too… Tsk, tsk. This kid isn’t a good person.”

Bai Zhixian was at a loss for words.

Meanwhile, the old man had laid back down on the bench and started snoring.

Bai Zhixian glanced at the old man, and then continued into the village with Yang Ye. During this time, she kept sizing up the surroundings. There were around 100 people in the small village, and most of them were probably ordinary people. However, some weren’t ordinary people. For example, the old man from before, or the elderly woman who’d passed by earlier. She’d sized up Yang Ye for quite a while when she passed by.

Bai Zhixian had sensed a strong feeling of danger from that woman!

Bai Zhixian quickly caught up to the young girl, Wang Erya, and she asked, “What is this place?”

Wang Erya glanced at Bai Zhixian, “Eternal Village.”

Bai Zhixian frowned, “Why are all of you here? Why don’t you go outside?”

Wang Erya shook her head, “We can’t. Grandpa said the world outside is dangerous.”

“Dangerous?” Bai Zhixian’s frown deepened, “Impossible. Based on your strength, very few people in the outside world can harm all of you!”

Wang Erya shook her head, “I don’t know. All I know is we can’t go outside. I’ve snuck out once, but I wasn’t even able to get outside before that old man by the entrance dragged me back here. That old man is really strong! So, don’t offend him!”

Bai Zhixian was at a loss for words.

Suddenly, Wang Erya looked into the distance, “Heh, the Butcher.”

She dashed over once she finished speaking.

Bai Zhixian looked over, and she saw a meat stall in the distance. Inside the meat stall stood a robust man with a face full of stubble. His upper body was bare, and he seemed very muscular but dark. At this moment, he was ceaselessly swinging a chopper.

Butcher’s face darkened when he heard Wang Erya’s voice, and then he lightly waved the chopper in his right hand. A lean piece of purple meat immediately descended before her, and she just chuckled and took it. After that, she made a face at Butcher and said, “Butcher, you gave this to me! I didn’t steal it!”

Butcher rolled his eyes, “What are you still doing here then?”

Wang Erya chuckled, and then she gazed at Bai Zhixian, “Come on! Hurry! Grandpa will get angry if we don’t get there soon!”

She turned around and sped up.

Bai Zhixian glanced at Butcher, and then she followed after the young girl. Right when she went past the stall, Butcher suddenly looked up at Yang Ye. But it only took a moment for him to move his gaze away, and he said, “He was injured by that big fellow?”

Bai Zhixian hesitated for a moment and nodded, “That Primal Demon!”

“Primal Demon?” Butcher laughed with ridicule, “He’s not a Primal Demon at all! If it wasn’t out of respect for his ancestors, I would have killed him a long time ago.”

He glanced at Yang Ye and continued, “To be honest, I’m a little curious.”

Bai Zhixian was puzzled, “About what?”

He replied, “Wang Erya’s grandpa is an old geezer who never does anything that isn’t beneficial to him. Yet he actually wants to meet that kid in your arms, so something’s definitely up. However, to be honest, there isn’t anything special about that kid. If there is anything slightly special, then it’s his Sword Domain. But even with the Sword Domain, he’s still a weakling. Moreover, his baleful energy is too strong, and so is the karma around him. Someone severed his previous life, and he himself severed his future.”

He glanced at Yang Ye again and continued, “Allow me to be honest, it’s a miracle among miracles that he was able to survive until now. So, I don’t understand what drew that old geezer’s attention.”

Bai Zhixian was stunned speechless.
