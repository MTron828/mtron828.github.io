The woman stood quietly on the top of the mountain.

A long time later, an old man appeared before her.

She shook her head slightly, “That person is gone!”

The old man asked, “Who?”

She replied, “I don’t know. However, that person was at least in the Sage Realm, and was clearly related to Yang Ye!”

The old man spoke solemnly, “Our clan has investigated him. Logically speaking, based on his character, the Sword Supreme would absolutely not go with him.”

The woman said, “That’s the most puzzling part. However, it shows that this is growing more and more unusual.”

She looked up at the sky and continued, “Our Xuanyuan Clan has kept a low profile for so many years because it has been afraid of drawing trouble to itself and being sacrificed by the four great clans. But now it seems like we may not be able to avoid that! Some things that are coming will come in the end!”

The old man spoke indifferently, “Then let it come! Our Xuanyuan Clan has nothing to fear!

She grinned, “Indeed!”

…

Spirit Monkey Mountain.

Black Ape asked, “You’ve attained the Dao Realm?”

Yang Ye nodded. After comprehending throughout this time, he’d attained the Hear Dao Realm, and taking this step allowed his overall strength to improve tremendously.

Perhaps it was still difficult for him to kill Zen Realm experts, but he wouldn’t be completely suppressed in battle against them any longer!

Presently, he had the strength to fight Zen Realm experts!

Meanwhile, Black Ape suddenly said, “They were from the Xuanyuan Clan!”

Yang Ye gazed at Black Ape, “So?”

Black Ape replied, “The Xuanyuan Clan was once the number one clan in the large universe, and it may still hold that title. Their resources and reserves run very deep.”

“The Xuanyuan Clan!” Yang Ye glanced at the sword in his grasp.

Meanwhile, Black Ape added, “That sword in your grasp once belonged to the Xuanyuan Clan’s ancestor, the Emperor Xuanyuan. His strength was unmatched amongst all the races when he used that sword!”

Yang Ye said, “They want it back!”

Black Ape shook his head, “That’s what I thought in the beginning, but it seems like they have no intention to take it back. However, your presence here has been exposed. Do you want to hide for a while?”

“Hide?” Yang Ye smiled, “Where?”

Black Ape fell silent. Yang Ye was wanted throughout the large universe, and he would be targeted no matter where he went!

Yang Ye said, “Have you heard anything about your ancestor?”

Black Ape shook his head slightly while worry flashed through his eyes.

Yang Ye fell silent for a moment and said, “Only three months have passed until now, and nine more remain. No Demon King will dare to cause trouble here until then. I plan to leave during this time.”

Black Ape nodded, “So long as Ancestor is alive, no Demon King will dare to touch Spirit Monkey Mountain.”

Yang Ye said, “Contact me if you need anything. I’ll definitely rush over as soon as possible.”

Yang Ye vanished into the sky once he finished speaking.

Black Ape looked up at the sky in silence.

…

Yang Ye shot swiftly through the clouds on his sword.

His objective was the Sky Dimension. He hadn’t forgotten about Zi’er, and it was time to make them hand her over.

“Kid, it’s about time I leave!” Suddenly, a voice resounded in Yang Ye’s mind.

Yang Ye stopped. A middle aged man appeared in front of him. It was Hou Qing.

Hou Qing’s body had completely recovered.

Yang Ye asked, “Senior, you’re going to the Shaman Dimension?”

Hou Qing nodded, “I’ve recovered my body and strength, so there probably won’t be anyone who dares to target me in the Shaman Dimension.”

Yang Ye nodded, “I’ll send you back!”

Hou Qing replied, “That’s perfect because there’s something I need your help with.”

Yang Ye asked, “What is it?”

The corners of Hou Qing’s mouth curled up slightly, “My territory in the Shaman Dimension seems to have been taken over by a new Shaman King. I have to go get it back. If that fellow is sensible, he’ll just give it back, but I don’t think he will!”

Yang Ye smiled, “Then take it back!”

Hou Qing smiled, “That’s what I’m thinking!”

Just like that, they vanished on the spot.

The Shaman Dimension!

Yang Ye and Hou Qing arrived at Yin Gorge, Yin Hou’s territory. As soon as she saw them, Yin Hou’s gaze fell on Hou Qing. Yang Ye shrugged and walked away.

Around two hours later, Yang Ye arrived in the hall, and only Yin Hou and Hou Qing were here.

Yin Hou sized up Yang Ye and said, “Looks like sending you to the Dead Dimension was the right decision. I didn’t expect you to have grown to such an extent!”

Yang Ye smiled, “I was almost unable to return!”

Yin Hou smiled, “But you did. However, you’re still facing the same trouble. So be careful.”

Yang Ye nodded, and then he gazed at Hou Qing, “Senior Hou Qing, are we going to see the Shaman Emperor or are we going to your territory?”

Hou Qing smiled, “No one will help uphold justice for me. It’s something I have to get for myself. Once I get back my territory, only then will I have the right to speak to the Shaman Emperor. Everything requires strength!”

Yang Ye nodded, “Then let’s go!”

They left the hall.

Cloudfall Mountain.

Cloudfall Mountain used to be Hou Qing’s territory, and it wasn’t very far from Yin Gorge. So, it only took less than two hours for them to get there.

Hou Qing had a wisp of complicated emotions in his eyes as he gazed at Cloudfall Mountain. After leaving for so long, even the mountains didn’t look the same anymore.

Everything had changed!

Hou Qing restrained his thoughts and stomped his right foot down.

Boom!

The ground in a huge area shook violently, and it didn’t take long for a middle aged man to appear before them.

“Yin Hou?” The middle aged man gazed at Yin Hou, “What’s the meaning of this?”

Yin Hou smiled, “Shaman King Li, I’m not the one looking for trouble with you today, it’s the person by my side!”

Shaman King Li immediately gazed at Hou Qing, and he was slightly stunned when he saw Hou Qing. A moment later, he spoke solemnly, “Hou Qing, I didn’t expect you to still be alive.”

Hou Qing smiled, “Are you disappointed?”

Shaman King Li replied, “A little. Looks like you’re here to take back your territory.”

Hou Qing nodded slightly, “Of course. However, I presume you won’t just let me have it. So, let’s fight!”

Shaman King Li replied, “Then bring it on. Let me see how much the Shaman King Hou Qing of the past has grown!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he tapped his right foot against the ground and vanished into the sky.

Hou Qing vanished right after him.

Only Yang Ye and Yin Hou remained here.

Yang Ye asked, “The winner stays?”

Yin Hou nodded slightly, “That’s what normally happens. After all, no one in the Shaman Race wishes to fight to the death. Of course, there are exceptions. However, I hope there are no exceptions.”

Yang Ye slowly closed his eyes, “I hope so too!”

Meanwhile, Yin Hou suddenly asked, “How strong are you now?”

Yang Ye pondered deeply for a moment and replied, “I can instantly kill anyone below the Zen Realm!”

Yin Hou was speechless.

Around two hours later, Hou Qing and Shaman King Li returned to where they’d been standing, and both of their faces were quite pale.

Hou Qing said, “You can leave now!”

Yin Hou visibly relaxed when she heard this.

Shaman King Li had quite the complicated expression on his face.

Suddenly, a few figures arrived from far away in the sky, and it didn’t take long for three middle aged men and an old man to appear by Shaman King Li’s side.

The middle aged men and the old man gazed at Hou Qing, and the old man said, “Hou Qing, I didn’t expect you to be so lucky!”

Hou Qing grinned, “Indeed. But many are going to be disappointed now.”

He gazed at Yang Ye and continued, “I don’t really have a good relationship with them.”

Yang Ye nodded slightly, “I understand!”

He gazed at the old man who led the group. The old man was the strongest here, and he was at the Attain Dao Realm.

The old man was about to speak when Yang Ye suddenly vanished on the spot, and a ray of light flashed.

At the moment Yang Ye vanished, the old man’s expression changed drastically. He was about to attack, but a sword was already pressed against his forehead.

There was a pair of wings on Yang Ye’s back, and it was the Sage Rank Divine Rings!

The surroundings suddenly fell deathly silent.

Hou Qing was quite stunned as well. Because he hadn’t expected Yang Ye to attack right away. Yang Ye had truly caught them all off guard!

Yang Ye pressed his sword forward, and it stabbed forward slightly, causing blood to instantly seep out from the old man’s forehead.

Yang Ye said, “From today onwards, this place belongs to Senior Hou Qing. Do you have a problem with that?”

The old man stared at Yang Ye, “Who are you?!”

Yang Ye said, “That’s none of your business. Did you hear what I said?”

The old man gazed at Yang Ye in silence.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye pressed his sword forward a little more, “Did you hear me?”

The old man gazed at Yang Ye for a long time before he said, “I did!”

Yang Ye lowered his sword!

Yang Ye gazed at Hou Qing and Yin Hou, “Seniors, I have other matters to attend to. Farewell.”

Hou Qing said, “Be careful!”

Yang Ye smiled, “Of course!”

Yang Ye transformed into a ray of light that vanished into the sky.

Hou Qing said, “All the races will find him very difficult to kill now.”

Yin Hou nodded slightly, “The speed of his growth simply puts us all to shame!”

Hou Qing smiled, “I know.”

Meanwhile, the old man suddenly asked, “Who is he?”

Hou Qing took a deep breath and replied, “I believe it won’t be long before his name will shock the entire large universe. You’ll know when that time comes!”
