Chapter 1655 - Sword Soul Technique!

Translator: InVader

A joke!

The expression on the woman’s soul had become icy cold. If one’s gaze could kill, then Yang Ye would have been dead over a hundred times.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly moved backwards. As soon as he did that, the woman’s soul instantly transformed into a ray of black light that entered her body, and then she turned to look at Yang Ye and spoke coldly, “Shameless!”

As far as she was concerned, a battle between sword cultivators should be carried out in an upright and fair manner. At the very least, that was how the sword cultivators she’d encountered in the past had fought. However, she hadn’t expected the sword cultivator before her to play tricks on her!

As far as she was concerned, it was shameless, extremely shameless!

Yang Ye shook his head, “You’re wrong.”

“I’m wrong?” She spoke coldly, “Sword cultivators should be upright and open. But how do you act? You aren’t worthy of being a sword cultivator!”

Yang Ye replied, “I really agree with what you said in the beginning. Because that’s your Dao of the Sword, but what you said at the end… I dare not agree with that. Every single sword cultivator has their own Sword Dao, and mine is to follow my heart. If I want to be upright, then I will; and if I want to be open, then I will. Similarly, if I want to be shameless, then I will. Understand?”

“Ill-founded reasoning!” She spoke coldly, “If you’re shameless, then you’re shameless. Yet you try to make excuses for yourself? Hypocrite!”

Yang Ye shrugged, “I admitted that I’m shameless.” Yang Ye paused for a moment and continued, “Let’s make a bet. We’ll fight fairly. If I lose, you can do as you please. Alright?”

She asked, “What if I lose?”

Yang Ye thought for a moment. He was about to speak when she suddenly spoke, “I don’t have any Soul Nurturing Wood.”

Yang Ye’s eyelids twitched. She’s not stupid!

Yang Ye thought for a moment and said, “I know you don’t have Soul Nurturing Wood. So, how about we do this? If you lose, bring me to the Ku Clan, and I’ll find my own way to obtain Soul Nurturing Wood. Alright? Don’t worry, I won’t be able to do anything. Just look at me. No matter how strong I am, it’s impossible for me to steal a piece of Soul Nurturing Wood from the Ku Clan, right?”

She remained silent for a long time, and then she said, “Then why do you want me to take you there?”

Suddenly, Yang Ye said, “There’s a problem with your heart towards the sword!”

She frowned, “What do you mean?!”

Yang Ye looked her in the eyes, “As a sword cultivator, you should advance forward courageously, and you should hold no fear in your heart. But what have you done? You’re considering your loss even before you’ve fought me. Isn’t that a problem?”

The woman’s brows were still pressed together. She wanted to say something, and her lips moved, but she didn’t say anything in the end.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye continued, “As a sword cultivator, even if your strength is inferior, you must believe in yourself and hold no fear in your heart. Only then can you truly bring forth your true strength. If there’s fear in your heart, you won’t be able to fight to your true potential, and you’ll be limiting yourself. Is a bound sword still a sword?”

Her brows were pressed tightly together, “What you said does make some sense, but why do I feel like there’s something wrong?”

Of course there was something wrong!

It wasn’t wrong to say that a sword cultivator should hold no fear in their hearts. However, asking about what would happen if she lost had nothing to do with that. If she didn’t inquire about everything before agreeing to compete with Yang Ye, then she wouldn’t be fearless but dumb.

Yang Ye’s eyelids twitched when he heard her, and then he quickly said, “Look at me. The Ku Clan’s strength is countless times greater than my own, but why do I dare to come here and ask for a piece of Soul Nurturing Wood? Why?”

She glanced at him and replied, “I think it’s because you’re stupid.”

Yang Ye was stunned speechless.

She continued, “While your strength isn’t bad, you’re courting death if you try to steal Soul Nurturing Wood!”

Yang Ye shook his head, “No, I’m just fearless! The Ku Clan is much stronger than me, but I’m not afraid of it! There’s no fear in my heart, only confidence!”

She sized up Yang Ye and said, “You are a little fearless, but I still think you’re stupid.”

Yang Ye’s face darkened, “So we can’t talk properly anymore?”

She spoke indifferently, “Didn’t you want to compete in the sword with me?”

Yang Ye nodded, “Then bring it on. Let’s fight fairly!”

“As you wish!” As soon as she finished speaking, her figure transformed into a ray of green light that vanished on the spot. At the same time, Yang Ye vanished on the spot as well. It didn’t take long for two rays of light to slam against each other in midair.

Bang!

An explosion resounded, and then both of them were pushed backwards. Meanwhile, countless rays of sword energy crisscrossed incessantly through the area between them. In just a short while, that expanse of space was sliced into pieces!

They exchanged glances, and then they vanished on the spot. They were a little over a meter away from each other when they appeared once more. The woman twisted her wrist slightly, and the bamboo splint in her grasp immediately moved like an agile serpent and stabbed towards Yang Ye’s throat at a tricky angle.

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly. He moved his right leg slightly to the side, and then he stabbed his sword forward.

His sword was extremely swift, and it struck against the top of the bamboo splint.

Yang Ye’s sword and her bamboo splint shook violently at the same time, and then both of them moved backwards repeatedly. Meanwhile, the space in front of them cracked apart, and it only took an instant for it to rumble and collapse.

Once that expanse of space collapsed, Yang Ye transformed into a ray of light that entered the black hole.

The woman’s expression changed when Yang Ye entered the black hole. It was because the black hole actually started to expand swiftly in her direction!

The woman didn’t dare act carelessly, and she immediately shot almost 10km away. At the same time, her eyes closed slightly. A moment later, her soul left her body, and then her soul raised the bamboo splint and swung it at the black hole!

Hiss!

A ray of green sword energy flashed out from the bamboo splint. This time, it was unlike the previous rays of green sword energy. Because everywhere it passed, space didn’t ripple at all, and it was slightly ethereal like it was a soul!

But once the sword energy entered the expanse of pitch black space, the black hole instantly exploded apart, and then a figure was blasted out of it.

It was Yang Ye’s figure!

Yang Ye’s figure flew over 3km before he finally stopped himself, and the expanse of pitch black space had been repaired.

Yang Ye glanced at his chest. There was an injury there, and it was extremely deep. It had pierced through his body.

If he hadn’t moved a little at the critical moment, her attack would have struck his heart!

It was her sword soul technique!

Yang Ye looked up at the woman. He hadn’t expected that her sword soul technique would actually be so formidable. After all, he had been within a black hole, and he’d controlled a huge amount of dark energy and dark matter within it. At that time, he was entirely capable of resisting the attack of a True Realm expert. However, he hadn’t been able to defend himself against her attack!

She’s strong! Yang Ye had a solemn expression on his face. He finally knew why she had dared to leave her body and move in soul form. It was because it would have been impossible for him to get close to her body if he hadn’t tricked her.

Presently, he was curious about her status in the Ku Clan. If just anyone in the Ku Clan was this strong, then the Ku Clan would be absolutely abnormal.

Meanwhile, she suddenly said, “Your attainments in the Sword Dao aren’t bad. Unfortunately, your sword techniques are too weak. Of course, even if you had a good sword technique, you would still be no match for me. As a fellow sword cultivator, while you are a little shameless, what you said earlier wasn’t wrong. It is your own Sword Dao. So, you can leave!”

Yang Ye was slightly stunned when he heard this, and then he shook his head and smiled, “I haven’t even gotten serious. Come, let’s try again.”

As he spoke, he started walking slowly in her direction.

Her face instantly became icy cold when she saw that he intended to continue fighting, “You brought this upon yourself.”

As soon as she finished speaking, she shook her wrist slightly, and then a ray of light flashed out from the bamboo splint in her grasp. The ray of light flashed through space and instantly arrived before Yang Ye.

However, when the sword energy arrived around 3m away from Yang Ye, it suddenly slowed down, and then it grew slower and slower. When it arrived before Yang Ye, it had stopped completely, and it grew more and more ethereal!

The Sword Domain!

The Sword Domain could suppress all sword intent. The green ray of sword energy contained her sword intent, and sword intent was exactly why it was so strong!

But the Sword Domain innately countered all sword intent!

It could be said that Yang Ye was the bane or counter to all sword cultivators. Of course, his opponent’s strength couldn’t be too much greater than his. Otherwise, he wouldn’t dare to use the Sword Domain to suppress his opponent. Because the slightest mistake may completely exhaust his lifespan!

Of course, there was another type of sword cultivator that could overcome this. It was the type of sword cultivator which didn’t utilize sword intent. For example, the one-armed woman he’d fought on Sky Sky Continent. She didn’t possess sword intent, so the Sword Domain couldn’t suppress her at all.

As for this woman before him, she clearly didn’t conform to any one of those examples!

Her eyes had instantly opened wide at the sight of this, and they were filled with shock and disbelief, “That… that’s the Sword Domain… Impossible… How could someone like you possibly comprehend the Sword Domain…?”

Yang Ye’s face instantly darkened when he heard her.

Meanwhile, she suddenly shook her head, “Impossible! I’m definitely seeing things!”

As soon as she finished speaking, she waved her sword at Yang Ye again.

Hiss!

A ray of green sword energy flashed.

Yang Ye felt speechless.
