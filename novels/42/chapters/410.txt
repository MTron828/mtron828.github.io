“I’m able to take you with me, but you have to promise me something. You’ll listen to me once you leave this place, and you can’t show yourself at will without my permission. Of course, I won’t make you stay like that forever, and you can leave once everything has calmed down. What do you think?” Yang Ye spoke in a very calm voice, but he was excited beyond words in his heart. It’s a Monarch Realm expert. If this fellow returns to the southern territory with me, then it will be equivalent to possessing an extraordinary subordinate to fight on my behalf!How could he not be excited when he was about to gain a Monarch Realm expert who would fight on his behalf?

The small white dragon was overjoyed when it heard Yang Ye. “You’re really able to take me with you? Don’t deceive me. Otherwise... otherwise... I’ll kill you!”

Yang Ye said, “Of course I won’t. After all, what would I gain from doing that? However, what benefits would I gain from taking you with me?”

The small white dragon fell silent for a short while before it said, “After the events here come to an end, look for a suitable time to come here again. There are some shiny and glowing things beneath the ground here. I don’t know what they are, but I think you should like them. I have a huge amount of those things, and I’ll give them all to you! Alright?”

Shiny? Glowing? What are they? But it probably isn’t trash.

However, Yang Ye refused to agree to just that! He said, “Even you don’t want those things, yet you want to give them to me? Is that all your gratitude is worth? After all, I’m putting my life in danger to save you!”

The white dragon said in a low voice, “How about you come here tonight, and I’ll bring you to my abode. You can feel free to take anything you like, alright?”

Yang Ye’s heart instantly jerked intensely when he heard this. After all, it was treasures accumulated for tens of thousands of years, so he naturally didn’t believe that the white dragon had merely gathered a bunch of trash, and there were definitely numerous treasures amongst them. Even though he was excited, he wasn’t stupid enough to reveal it. Because while the dragon had the intelligence of a child, it wasn’t an idiot!

Yang Ye feigned hesitance for some time before he said, “Fine, I’ll take it as doing a good deed.”

The white dragon was instantly delighted upon hearing this, and it said, “I’ll definitely repay you if you’re really able to save me from this imprisonment!”

“Don’t mention it!” Yang Ye nodded and said, “Let me ask you a question. Why was I unable to transfer my Karmic Luck to another person? What’s the reason for that?”

“That person is dead or that person’s time is about to be up!” The white dragon said, “Because that’s the only reason that prevents Karmic Luck from being transferred!”

Yang Ye suddenly clenched his fists tightly while his eyes instantly turned crimson red. A long time passed before he calmed to rage and fear in his heart. Yang Ye worked hard to maintain his calm because his mother should still be alive right now. After all, Elder Mu had said that his mother would be fine for now. Since it said it could be because someone’s time is about to be up, then it means that Mother is in an extremely bad state right now!

“It’s a promise! You must come here tonight!” said the white dragon. After that, Yang Ye felt the scene in front of him change, and he was still standing on the combat arena when he opened his eyes again.

The enormous white dragon took a deep glance at Yang Ye from midair, and then it transformed into a ray of white light that entered the ground.

After that, the representatives of the sects from the central territory left with the disciples they’d chosen, and then remaining profounders from the various territories left successively as well.

Mo Ke glanced at An Nanjing and Yang Ye, and then he led the members of the devil race as he turned around and left.

An Nanjing glanced at Yang Ye and said, “Remember our agreement.” She turned around and left once she finished speaking.

In next to no time, only Yang Ye, his brothers, and Xiao Tianji remained on the arena.

Xiao Tianji waved his hand, and then Zhang Liu and the others instantly vanished on the spot while their whereabouts were unknown. Yang Ye was shocked by this and gazed at Xiao Tianji. The latter grinned and said, “Don’t worry, I merely made them leave for a while.”

Yang Ye nodded and said, “Senior, go ahead!”

Xiao Tianji said, “Firstly, I have to thank you for changing Yuxi’s fate, and thank you for doing so much for her. Now, I have to warn you. That little girl suffered too much from a young age. Her mother died young, so she roamed the world with me, causing her to be unable to grow up happily like a normal girl. I hope that you’ll treat her well and won’t let her down.”

“Of course,” said Yang Ye.

Xiao Tianji nodded and said, “You’re going to return to the southern territory, right?”

Yang Ye nodded.

“Can you not go?” Xiao Tianji said, “Just take it as doing something for Yuxi!”

Yang Ye shook his head and said, “I have to go back. Don’t worry Senior, I won’t make Yuxi go back with me.”

He knew what Xiao Tianji was worried about. His trip back to the southern territory was extremely dangerous, and it was natural for Xiao Tianji to be worried about Xiao Yuxi. However, he hadn’t planned to bring her with him as well. Because it was really too dangerous this time!

Xiao Tianji pondered deeply for a short while before he said, “That’s not what I meant. I didn’t want you to return because the current situation in the southern territory is extremely complicated, and the enmity between the various powers there is on the verge of erupting. If you return now, then you’ll definitely be swept into that vortex. That’s very bad for you. Moreover, the members of my Xiao Clan aren’t ungrateful people. Since you’ve saved Yuxi and are her husband, then you should be clearly aware of her character. How could she possibly allow you to return by yourself?”

Yang Ye could only laugh bitterly when he thought of Xiao Yuxi’s determined character, but he really couldn’t take her with him this time!

“You’ve saved Yuxi, so my Xiao Clan owes you a debt of gratitude!” Meanwhile, Xiao Tianji suddenly said, “Even though my Xiao Clan once said that it wouldn’t participate in the struggles between the powers of the outside world, you’re not an outsider to my Xiao Clan anymore. So, I’ll lend you a hand. As for whether you can rescue your mother successfully and resolve the danger you face, we can only leave it up to the will of the heavens!”

Yang Ye was filled with joy when he heard this, and he said, “Thank you!”

With Xiao Tianji’s help, Yang Ye definitely had a higher chance of rescuing his mother this time.

“Kind actions carry a good fortune while evil actions carry misfortune, this is your good fortune!” Xiao Tianji said, “On the surface, you seem to have enemies on all fronts, but it’s actually not the case. You have many people on your side, but they haven’t shown themselves as your enemies have. That’s the reason why I’m not opposed to your intentions to return to the southern territory!”

Yang Ye said, “Senior, I really don’t want to bring Yuxi along with me this time. You should be clearly aware of what I have to face once I return.”

Xiao Tianji smiled and said, “I’ll naturally have no objections if you’re able to convince her not to go!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Xiao Tianji’s figure flashed and vanished on the spot. At the same time, his voice arrived from afar. “Treat Yuxi well.”

A short while later, Yang Ye shook his head and waved his hand, and then Xiao Yuxi appeared here. She was slightly dazed. A trace of happiness flashed through her eyes when she saw Yang Ye, but it was only for a moment.

Yang Ye walked over to her and toucher her hair. He said in a light voice while he felt how smooth her hair was, “You’re cursed no more from today onward, and you can live like a normal person.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye stretched out his hand and embraced her, and then he whispered by her ear. “It’s truly nice to see you awake.”

In the beginning, Xiao Yuxi’s figure was slightly stiff, but it wasn’t long before her delicate figure had loosened up. However, she seemed to be very unaccustomed to such an embrace, so she couldn’t help but clench her fists while seeming to not know where to put them.

After a long time passed, Xiao Yuxi said, “Let go!”

Yang Ye was stunned, and then he said with a puzzled tone, “Why? I like hugging you like this!”

“Your hands aren’t allowed to touch me!” Xiao Yuxi’s voice carried a trace of embarrassment.

Yang Ye’s hands that were on her hips stopped momentarily upon hearing this, but it wasn’t long before they moved once more while he said, “There’s nothing wrong with that. In any case, it isn’t the first time!”

Bang!

Suddenly, Yang Ye was blasted flying to the ground. Yang Ye was slightly dazed. Everything was fine, so why didn’t she suddenly attack me? Yang Ye was slightly dazed at this moment.

Meanwhile, Xiao Yuxi blushed as she glared fiercely at Yang Ye. A curved saber had suddenly appeared in her hand, and it flickered with a dazzling glow.

Yang Ye’s eyelids twitched when he witnessed this scene. What? Does she intend to kill her own husband?Xiao Yuxi walked slowly towards Yang Ye while the glow on her saber grew more and more strong, more and more dazzling. In next to no time, she arrived in front of Yang Ye, and then she brought the saber close to his neck....
