Chapter 1383 – I Can’t Suppress It MuChapter Longer!

Why did they want to take Yang Ye’s head first?

It was very simple. It was because Yang Ye’s head was the most valuable. The price on Yang Ye’s head was the highest, and it was more valuable than a hall master of Nether Pavilion. So long as they took Yang Ye’s head, each of them could obtain a permit. In that way, they would have accomplished their goal. Moreover, Yang Ye was clearly in a weakened state, so it really was the best time to kill him!

Yang Ye was Lian Suyao’s target as well. Similarly, Yang Ye’s head was the most valuable and easiest to take.

So long as she got his head, she would turn around and leave.

The experts of the Nether Pavilion weren’t ordinary, and she wasn’t confident in her ability to defeat this hall master before her. However, she was confident in her ability to kill Yang Ye right now.

Yang Ye’s face fell when he noticed that all their auras had locked onto him. Needless to say, Mo Xiaoleng’s plan was a really good one. After all, with those permits as a reward for his life, wouldn’t the experts of the lower dimension pursue him all day and night? Moreover, it wouldn’t just be the younger generation, even some of the older generation would have probably started to target him by now.

Of course, he didn’t have to worry about them for now, he had to worry about the people in front of him.

Yang Ye turned to shoot a glance at Boundary Maiden, yet he noticed that she seemed to have no intention to lend him a hand. Yang Ye fell silent for an instant before he slowly clenched his fists and started to circulate the Stellar Ward technique. He was naturally not going to execute the Stellar Ward technique, and he was just drawing down stellar energy into his body. Even if it wasn’t suitable to draw stellar energy into his body now. After all, his body had been exhausted to its limits. So, if he were to forcefully utilize more strength, then it wouldn’t just be exhaustion that he experienced.

However, he had no other choice.

Boundary Maiden wasn’t skilled in single combat. Not to mention that there were 6 experts in front of them!

As for Qiong Qi, he’d tried to call Qiong Qi earlier, but that fellow didn’t reply at all. Yang Ye didn’t know whether Qiong Qi was still digesting the black dragon’s energy, or if Qiong Qi was sleeping. In any case, he was very well aware that he couldn’t rely on that fellow for now.

Right when Yang Ye was about to draw stellar energy into his body, a pillar of light shot up from below. It was extremely swift and instantly arrived before Yang Ye and Boundary Maiden, and then it shot towards Lian Suyao and the others.

This unexpected attack caused their expressions to change. However, they didn’t seem to panic, and they simultaneously attacked and instantly shattered the pillar of light.

However, once the pillar of light had been destroyed, Yang Ye and Boundary Maiden had vanished into the distance.

“Go after them!” As soon as she finished speaking, Lian Suyao tapped her right foot down and appeared 30km away. Her speed was shocking. Hua Tianyuan and the others didn’t hesitate, and they chased after Yang Ye and Boundary Maiden.

Lian Suyao and the others raised their speeds to their limits, and they were closing the gap between them and Yang Ye’s group. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Boundary Maiden was by Yang Ye’s side, and she was holding him right now. There was another woman not too far ahead of them. Yang Ye had met her in the past. Not only had he met her, he’d even gotten into conflict with her.

It was Light Maiden.

Yang Ye asked, “You notified them?”

Boundary Maiden nodded.

Yang Ye asked, “Why has only one of you come here?” If Nether Maiden, Oblivion Maiden, and the pig-riding woman came as well, then their side wouldn’t have to fear Lian Suyao’s group. It was even to the extent that it wouldn’t be difficult for them to annihilate Lian Suyao’s group.

Boundary Maiden spoke solemnly, “We have to return as soon as possible.”

Yang Ye asked solemnly, “What exactly is going on?” At this moment, he noticed that Boundary Maiden had a very serious expression on her face.

Boundary Maiden shook her head and remained silent.

Yang Ye glanced at Boundary Maiden and didn’t ask about it again. The Nether Pavilion was a mystery to him, and he knew that they were definitely doing something on the Radiant Dimension. However, he didn’t know exactly what they were doing. However, it seemed like it was definitely not anything minor. Otherwise, it wouldn’t have made the experts of the large world act against them.

Yang Ye and Boundary Maiden arrived in the sky above the Radiant Dimension under Light Maiden’s escort. However, Lian Suyao and the others had followed them here. Yang Ye was about to speak when the woman who rode the pig and Nether Maiden appeared before them.

The pig-riding woman gazed at Boundary Maiden and said, “Welcome back.”

Boundary Maiden nodded, “I’m not too late, right?”

The pig-riding woman replies, “Not really!”

Boundary Maiden didn’t speak another word, and she just shot down and vanished.

Once Boundary Maiden left, the pig-riding woman’s gaze descended onto Yang Ye. She sized him up and said, “You really are tenacious."

Yang Ye’s face darkened. He was about to speak when she continued, “Actually, this is our own business, so you don’t have to join in. It’s a very complicated matter. Even that woman, Lady, who helped you that day isn’t qualified to interfere in this matter. So....”

Yang Ye laughed bitterly and replied, “I know, but it’s not my decision now. I have to even if I don’t want to. Someone up there wants to kill me too, and the price on my head is higher than all of you. It’s 5 permits! I’m their number one target right now. All of you are only their secondary targets!”

5 permits! The corners of her eyes twitched slightly. She gazed at Yang Ye for quite some time before she said, “Your ability to cause trouble is truly extraordinary. Someone from the lower dimensions actually has an enemy in the large world. How did you accomplish that?”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

Meanwhile, Nether Maiden said, “Go recuperate.”

She’s still the nicest! Yang Ye nodded, and then he said, “I’ll recover first.” As soon as he finished speaking, he sat down cross-legged on the spot, and then he withdrew a huge pile of divine crystals and started absorbing the energy within them.

Countless strands of spirit energy instantly appeared around Yang Ye before surging towards him. In the end, all of it was absorbed by the Primordial Pagoda within him, and it didn’t take long for threads of violet energy to seep out from the Primordial Pagoda. After that, the violet energy was swiftly absorbed by Yang Ye’s body.

Meanwhile, Lian Suyao’s group stopped when they saw Nether Maiden and the pig-riding young woman.

They were vigilant!

Their eyes were filled with vigilance as they gazed at Nether Maiden and the pig-riding young woman. All of them had experienced numerous battles, so they were able to discern danger with a single glance.

The pig-riding young woman only had 2 other companions, Light Maiden and Nether Maiden.

It was 3 against 6!

A moment of silence ensued, and then Lian Suyao gazed at Hua Tianyuan. The latter pondered deeply for a moment, and then a cold glow flashed in his eyes as he nodded.

“I’ll deal with that woman on a pig. All of you deal with the other two!” As soon as Lian Suyao finished speaking, she instantly vanished on the spot, and she was in front of the pig-riding young woman when her figure appeared once more. After that, she flipped her palm and slapped it forward.

Space trembled before her palm, and it rumbled like thunder.

The pig-riding woman’s face was calm when she saw the palm slap towards her, and then she raised her hand and swung her club forward.

Bang! Bang! Bang!

It didn’t take long for Lian Suyao and the pig-riding woman to be locked in fierce combat.

Meanwhile, Nether Maiden and Light Maiden were in battle with Hua Tianyuan’s group. Even though Hua Tianyuan’s side had the advantage in numbers, they didn’t gain any advantage over Nether Maiden and Light Maiden. However, they cooperated very well, so Nether Maiden and Light Maiden couldn’t gain an advantage as well. For a time, they were equally matched in battle.

Something worthy of mentioning was that Light Maiden, Nether Maiden, and the pig-riding young woman were just Quasi Emperors, whereas Hua Tianyuan and the others were Voiders!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye absorbed the energy from those divine crystals like a madman. As more and more spirit energy surged into him, his body gradually recovered. At the same time, some profound energy appeared within him.

Yang Ye was observing the situation while he absorbed the spirit energy. His gaze descended onto the pig-riding woman and Lian Suyao. Yang Ye was really quite surprised by Lian Suyao. Because she actually didn’t fall into a disadvantaged position while in fierce battle with the pig-riding young woman! Moreover, she was growing stronger as the battle went on!

The pig-riding young woman wasn’t weak either, and her aura was growing stronger as the battle progressed.

Needless to say, their battle was very exciting. Regardless of whether it was combat experience, utilization of techniques, both of them excelled in them. It could be said that it was a feast for the eyes.

They were true monstrous geniuses!

Regardless of whether it was Lian Suyao, Hua Tianyuan, or the others in their group, all of them were true monstrous geniuses. Yang Ye had traveled through the Radiant Dimension and Dark Hell Continent, but he’d rarely met any geniuses in the younger generation. In his heart, only the hall masters of the Nether Pavilion could go against him in the same realm of cultivation. However, the scene before him told him that there were many geniuses in this world who were on par with him.

Most importantly, Hua Tianyuan and the others weren’t even in the top 10 of the Dragon Rankings. If those below the top 10 were already so strong, wouldn’t the top 5 be capable of killing Deities?

Yang Ye couldn’t help but have a solemn expression on his face when he thought up to this point.

Even though he didn’t care about the permit to enter the large world, these fellows seemed to really desire it. In other words, the top 10 on the Dragon Rankings might come looking for him as well.

Bang!

Meanwhile, an explosion suddenly resounded from afar.

Yang Ye looked up and saw that the pig-riding young woman and Lian Suyao had split up.

Lian Suyao was staring at the pig-riding woman, “I never expected the Radiant Dimension to possess a genius like you!”

The pig-riding young woman glanced indifferently at Lian Suyao, “You’re not bad yourself. Allow me to give you a piece of advice. Forget about the permits and get far away from the Radiant Dimension. Otherwise, it would be pointless even if you’re given 100 permits. Because you wouldn’t be alive to use them!”

Lian Suyao laughed coldly, “Are you that confident?”

All geniuses were confident. Similarly, they were conceited on many occasions.

The pig-riding young woman didn’t speak another word. She just patted the huge white pig beneath her.

Roar!

The pig roared, and then it shot forward like a bolt of lightning. Once it arrived before Lian Suyao, the young woman’s spiked club slammed straight down at Lian Suyao.

Lian Suyao’s eyes narrowed slightly. Her palms trembled slightly, and then she clenched them and slammed them forward!

Bang!

The space between them instantly collapsed, but it didn’t take long for the space there to be repaired by the Laws of the Heaven Dao.

The pig-riding young woman and Lian Suyao exchanged glances in midair.

Bang!

The pig-riding young woman was just about to attack when an explosion that shook the sky resounded from below.

At this moment, the heavens and the earth were trembling!

Everyone stopped fighting and looked down.

Meanwhile, Boundary Maiden’s trembling voice came from below, “I can’t suppress it much longer!”
