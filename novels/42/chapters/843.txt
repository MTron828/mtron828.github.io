“I... I’ll give it to you!” The middle aged man hadn’t even spoken when the woman in Yang Ye’s grasp spoke in a hoarse voice.

Yang Ye withdrew his gaze from the middle aged man and gazed at her while a slight smile curled up onto the corners of his mouth, “You’re much more sensible!”

The woman gazed at Yang Ye with terror in her eyes. Actually, she was frightened out of her wits. After all, she was at the Exalt Realm as well, just like Yang Ye was. However, she noticed that she didn’t even have the ability to fight back against Yang Ye!

Yang Ye let go of her once he received a spatial ring from her, and she instantly slumped to the ground. Yang Ye walked over to Lin Shuhai who was still breathing. At this moment, Lin Shuhai was looking at him as well, but just like the woman, his eyes were filled with terror.

Suddenly, the middle aged man spoke in a low voice, “I’ll pay 10,000 extreme-grade energy stones!”

“I’m not selling this one!” As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye suddenly kicked Lin Shuhai’s stomach, and then the latter was blasted away.

“You’re courting death!” A terrifying aura exploded out from the middle aged man, and then it enveloped down towards Yang Ye.

“You’re just at the Monarch Realm! What’re you being so noisy for!?” As soon as Yang Ye finished speaking, he’d appeared before the middle aged man, and then the middle aged man felt a hand tighten around his throat.

“You....” Terror appeared in the middle aged man’s eyes as well. He hadn’t imagined that a mid rank Monarch Realm expert like him would actually be so helpless before Yang Ye!

Suddenly, the space not too far from them trembled violently, and then an old man in a white robe appeared here.

He was a Half-Saint, and he was even a high rank Half-Saint!

The old man sized up Yang Ye before he said, “That old goat Gu was bragging to everyone that he took someone with great promise as his disciple. I’d thought he was just bragging. But now it would seem like he really has.”

“Senior, you know my Master?” Yang Ye was very well aware that he had to use the Ancient Sword School’s name right now.

“Of course!”

Yang Ye released the middle aged man and said, “I have to give Senior face. Senior, please do tell the younger generation of your academy that they can come looking for trouble with me, but it’s best that they bring more energy stones with them. Otherwise, I’m afraid they won’t be able to return!”

“You really are arrogant!” The old man continued, “If you survive, then pay a visit to my academy. My Academy will allow you to realize that there’s always someone stronger in this world!”

Yang Ye replied, “I definitely will!”

“We’ll be waiting for you!” As soon as he finished speaking, the old man waved his right hand and vanished along with the middle aged man and the woman.

“You’ve become even stronger!” Suddenly, the woman from the Dao Order appeared here.

“Go tell the Dao Order that if they want to kill me, then send someone strong. Stop sending these useless pieces of trash to waste my time. Besides that, it’s best if they bring more energy stones. I... am very poor!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye turned around and walked towards the carriage.

The woman watched Yang Ye’s group leave on the carriage, and she stood there for a long time before leaving.

Fan Meng wrapped her hand around Yang Ye’s arm as she asked softly, “Yang Ye, you’re still at the high rank of the Exalt Realm, yet why do I feel like you’re much, much stronger than before?”

Yang Ye smiled. He was naturally much stronger. After he consumed almost 20,000 extreme-grade energy stones, he’d finally restored his physical body to the strength of a Half-Saint! Now, he was at the Exalt Realm in cultivation, but his body was at the Half-Saint Realm!

Now, he only had to resolve the problem with his meridians, and then Half-Saints would be like helpless chickens waiting to be slaughtered by him!

“We’re here!” Suddenly, Fan Li’s voice resounded.

Yang Ye looked forward, and he saw a huge city lying not too far away like a sleeping beast. Moreover, there were endless mountains surrounding the entire city!

“Hmm?” Yang Ye suddenly frowned.

Fan Li asked, “What is it?”

Yang Ye replied, “Stellar Sky City hasn’t been breached, but it’s about to....”

...

Stellar Sky City.

At this moment, Stellar Sky City was in a mess. More than half of its walls were destroyed while mountains of corpses covered the city walls and the area around it. There were corpses of demon beasts, but most were human.

Li Qingyi and Li Maozhen were standing on the city walls, and an old man with snow white hair stood before them.

The white haired old man spoke in an indisputable tone, “Qingyi, Maozhen, both of you leave through the tunnels later!”

Li Maozhen coughed a few times before he laughed bitterly, “Grandfather, you’re going to make both of us unable to live in peace forever!”

“Both of you’ll live in peace if you stay, but countless people of our city will die with everlasting regret!” The old man sighed, “Qingyi, Maozhen, both of your natural talents aren’t bad. Especially Maozhen. Unfortunately, I, Li Xuanji, failed to protect you well and allowed you to be poisoned by someone. It destroyed your entire future, and it destroyed the future of our city. Dammit! Dammit!!!”

Li Maozhen said, “So, it’s pointless for me to hang onto life!”

“My Li Clan would truly be without an heir if you die!” Li Xuanji continued, “Mao Zhen, Qingyi, don’t be stubborn. Our Li Clan would only have hope for the future if both of you stay alive, and only then would you have the chance to avenge us. But if you die, then who will avenge my Li Clan?”

Li Maozhen fell silent.

“Li Xuanji, I’ll leave a small bit of your bloodline intact if you surrender. If you don’t, then the day the city is breached is the day your Li Clan’s line ends!” Suddenly, an old man in a linen robe appeared in the distant sky, and there was a completely pitch black and enormous wolf beneath the old man.

“Yu Cangping, do you think that I, Li Xuanji, am a 3 year old?” Li Xuanji spoke coldly, “With the enmity between your Beastmaster Sect and my Stellar Sky City, my Li Clan would probably be instantly slaughter by all of you if we are to surrender!”

“Why waste your breath on him! Let’s just attack and kill!” Meanwhile, a short haired old man appeared by Yu Cangping’s side, and there was a broken saber hanging on the old man’s waist.

“The Broken Saber, Yun Renxing!” Li Xuanji’s gaze descended onto the short haired man, and he spoke in a heavy tone, “There’s no enmity between my Stellar Sky City and your Broken Saber Villa. So, I’m very curious why you would interfere in the enmity between the Beastmaster Sect and my city?”

“Do you even have to ask?” Yun Renxing spoke coldly, “Stellar Sky City has 4 low-grade Spirit Veins while my Broken Saber Villa and the Beastmaster Sect only have 1 each. Tell me, how could we possibly not covet it? Of course, that’s not the true reason. The true reason is that someone wants your Stellar Sky City destroyed. Hahaha!”

“Who exactly did my Stellar Sky City offend!?” Li Xuanji spoke in a low voice.

“Me!” Suddenly, an icy cold voice resounded from the sky, and then a woman shot through the sky towards them while standing on the back of a black eagle!

“Young Miss Ming!” Li Xuanji’s expression changed slightly. Because it was the daughter of Martial Enlightenment City’s Governor. Moreover, it was a Gold Rank sect!

“It’s you!” Li Maozhen frowned when he saw her.

The woman’s gaze fell on Li Maozhen as she said, “Li Maozhen, you never expected me to be the daughter of Martial Enlightenment City’s Governor, right? You refused me in public that day, and I told you that I’ll make you pay a price you’ll never be able to endure. Now, you’ve been crippled, and you family is about to be annihilated because of you! Hahaha!” There was a trace of madness in the woman’s eyes, but there was a mix of various other emotions as well.

“So it was you who did all of it!” Li Maozhen closed his eyes and clenched his fists tightly.

“Don’t you hate me? Yes, I want you to hate me! I want you to hate me forever!” The woman spoke ferociously, “Kill them! Kill everyone from the Li Clan besides Li Maozhen!”

“Alright!” Yun Renxing laughed coldly and was about to attack. However, a carriage suddenly dashed over from afar.

“You’re courting death!” A disciple from the Beastmaster Sect charged towards the carriage. However, he hadn’t even reached it before he was blasted flying, and he transformed into a pile of mush.

Yu Cangping and Yun Renxing’s expressions changed slightly. They exchanged glances and saw a trace of seriousness in each other’s eyes. Because that disciple who charged at the carriage just now was a cultivator at the high rank of the Exalt Realm, but he’d been instantly obliterated.

The carriage stopped, and then a man and 2 women walked out from within it.

Li Qingyi exclaimed, “Yang Ye!”

Yang Ye’s name was still quite unfamiliar to the people here. After all, it was quite a remote part of the entire prefecture.

Yang Ye glanced at the people here, and then his gaze descended onto Li Maozhen, “Brother Li, allow me to use the teleportation formation within the city!”

Li Maozhen gazed at Yang Ye for a short while before he said, “That’s not a problem!”

“Thank you!” Yang Ye, Fan Li, and Fan Meng started walking towards Stellar Sky City. However, there were many standing in their way.

Yang Ye gazed at Yu Cangping and Yun Renxing, “I’m just passing through. I don’t want to interfere in your business!”

Yu Cangping gazed at Yang Ye for a short while before he said, “Let him pass!”

“Don’t!” Suddenly, a voice resounded from the horizon, and then an old man arrived here. It was none other than Ye Zhan who’d fled that day!

Ye Zhan said, “Brother Yu, Brother Yun, do you know who he is?” He continued before they could answer him, “Brother Yu, he’s the one who killed over a dozen Exalt Realm cultivators and a Monarch Realm cultivator of your Beastmaster Sect. Moreover, it was he who chopped off your granddaughter, Zi Xin’s, arm! Besides that, it was he who called your son, Brother Yun!”

A ferocious expression immediately appeared on both Yu Cangping and Yun Renxing’s faces when they heard him!

Yu Cangping spoke fiercely, “Chop him into pieces but keep the women alive!”

Swoosh!

A ray of black light flashed through the sky, and then a few hundred disciples of the Beastmaster Sect and Broken Saber Villa were instantly transformed into corpses!

“His life belongs to me, Xiao Yu! His women belong to me, Xiao Yu, as well!” A black robed man arrived here.
