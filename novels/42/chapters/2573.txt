Chapter 2574

Yang Ye glanced at Qi Bitian with displeasure. Because she was actually planning on taking the Primordial Pagoda, and he felt that she was truly heartless!

Fortunately, it was better for her to have it than anyone else.

After playing two rounds with her, Yang Ye left the Primordial Pagoda.

The Ancient Sword Sect.

At this moment, the sword intent and sword energy above the sect was starting to disperse.

Once all of it vanished, the Soul Sect and the other powers would attack once more. He understood that, and so did the others in the sect!

He only felt guilty about Nether Maiden and the others. He really regretted dragging them into this!

“It’s easy to get help, but difficult to send it away!” Yang Ye didn’t try to hatch a plan like they asked because it was a waste of time.

However, Yang Ye suddenly received some good news.

The desolate race had taken over the entire Eternal Border!

Moreover, the desolate race had eliminated all the Eternal Kingdom’s forces outside Eternal Kingdom. It could be said that besides Eternal Kingdom, most of the other universes were under the desolate race’s control!

This time, the desolate race didn’t choose to fight on its own, and they had chosen to advance step by step!

It was naturally good news for Yang Ye. The enemy of my enemy is my friend, not to mention that he always had a good relationship with the desolate race!

The sudden action taken by the desolate race had undoubtedly shocked Eternal Kingdom!

Compared to the Ancient Sword Sect, the desolate race was a truly terrifying existence!

Thus, the Leng Clan, Lu Clan, Xing Clan, and all the other powers had left the Ancient Sword Sect and returned.

But the Soul Sect hadn’t left!

The Soul Sect’s experts were still waiting outside the Ancient Sword Sect.

Obviously, they didn’t want to spare the Ancient Sword Sect. After all, it was just within their reach!

But it didn’t take long for the Soul Exalt and the others to retreat from the Ancient Sword Sect’s territory. Just like that, the Ancient Sword Sect escaped danger thanks to the desolate race!

Yang Ye was naturally not happy about it because they may return at any moment!

Fortunately, the Ancient Sword Sect had some time to catch its breath and recuperate now!

In the meeting hall.

There were a few more people here this time. They were Elder Xue and the others who’d previously left. Along with their return, the Ancient Sword Sect had its pillar of support, and so Sword Scroll and Gu Nan weren’t that busy anymore!

Most importantly, they weren’t good at management.

But the return of Elder Xue and the others allowed everything in the sect to be run smoothly again!

Yang Ye restored their previous status and authority as well!

No matter what had happened in the past, they had come to live and die with the sect when it was a moment of life and death for the sect. That alone was enough to make up for everything!

Yang Ye glanced at them and said, “While the other powers have temporarily retreated because of the desolate race, if I were them, I would resolve this latent problem before the war with the desolate race. It’s very likely for them to make that decision too. So, we are not safe yet, and we have no chance against them either!”

They gazed at Yang Ye and waited for him to continue.

Yang Ye stood up, “From this moment onward, everything in the sect is open to all disciples. Allow them to learn the best and use the best. Besides that, regardless of whether they are inner court, outer court, or elite disciples, give them the best places to cultivate at. If we don’t have enough space, then give them my abode as well. All of you have no objections, right?”

They exchanged glances and shook their heads.

How could they have any objections at a time like this?

Yang Ye nodded slightly, “Besides that, Elder Xue and Elder Gu Nan, both of you have a new responsibility now, to be Inheritance Elders. Try your best to find time to help all the disciples with their cultivation.”

They nodded slightly to display their agreement.

Yang Ye nodded, “Then that’s all.”

It didn’t take long for all of them to leave, leaving only Yang Ye and Sword Scroll in the hall.

Sword Scroll asked, “Should we contact the desolate race?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “That isn’t necessary.”

She was puzzled, “Why?”

Yang Ye smiled, “Our strength isn’t equal. Moreover, we are within Eternal Kingdom while they are outside. There’s no real benefit from contacting them, unless they attack Eternal Kingdom right now.” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Sword Scroll nodded slightly, “Then what do we do now?”

Yang Ye walked out of the hall and spoke softly, “Get stronger!”

After speaking to Sword Scroll, Yang Ye went to the Primordial Pagoda and went to see Qi Bitian.

Qi Bitian spoke casually, “Congratulations! It seems you don’t have to die for now!”

Yang Ye asked, “How do I improve my strength further? For example, how do I attain the Lord Realm?”

She glanced at him, “It’s impossible!”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Why?”

Qi Bitian explained, “If you advance to the Lord Realm by force now, it would be like killing a hen for its eggs. Haven’t you noticed? Your cultivation isn’t very stable. Regardless of whether it's your mental state, body, or cultivation, all of them aren’t very strong.”

Not strong!

Yang Ye frowned slightly, “I think it’s very stable!”

His cultivation had been suppressed for a long time before allowing it to advance naturally, so as far as he was concerned, it was very, very strong and stable!

She glanced at Yang Ye and replied indifferently, “You’re so thick skinned that you even lie to yourself!”

Yang Ye felt speechless.

She said, “Perhaps your cultivation is very strong in the eyes of many, but as far as I’m concerned, it’s just ordinary. You still have a huge amount of space to grow in the Five World Realm!”

Yang Ye hurriedly asked, “How do I do that?”

She glanced at him and seemed to have thought of something at this point. She blinked and approached him before speaking softly, “I know of a place that’s really fun. Wanna go there?”

Yang Ye glanced at her with a strange look in his eyes. Obviously, she was definitely planning something!

Qi Bitian added, “It will help you fortify your cultivation, and it may even help you advance further once you’ve fortified it. You may attain the Lord Realm there! Don’t you want to attain the Lord Realm?”

Yang Ye replied seriously, “Little Qi, you must realize that I’m not like you. My body is weak and fragile, it can’t endure much! Is that place dangerous?”

She blinked, “Is it dangerous? I don’t think so…”

A shiver ran down Yang Ye’s spin when he heard her drag her speech like that. Obviously, she wasn’t really certain!

Meanwhile, Qi Bitian added, “I don’t think it’s dangerous!”

Yang Ye spoke seriously, “Don’t use your standards to determine that, use mine. Do you think it’s dangerous for me?”

He had to figure it out with absolute clarity!

After all, he wanted to avoid any “Snowy situation”. Snowy had no idea how strong he was, and as far as she was concerned, he could deal with any danger. That had almost killed him on many occasions!

Qi Bitian sized up Yang Ye and thought for a very long time before she said, “I think there is some danger for you, but you aren’t that weak either. It shouldn’t be very, very dangerous for you over there. Moreover, there is no reward without risk. How can you gain anything if you go to a place without any risk? So, are you coming?”

Yang Ye glanced at her and said, “What is this place you’re speaking about?”

Qi Bitian cracked a smile and was quite excited, “I just noticed it a short while ago. It’s in Eternal Kingdom. According to my inference, it should be the origin of Eternal Kingdom.”

“The origin?” Yang Ye was quite curious, “Are you talking about the place where Eternal Kingdom was formed?”

Qi Bitian nodded, “Every world has an initial form, and Eternal Kingdom is no exception. That place is quite mysterious, and it took me a very long time to locate. Unfortunately, Cang Mu and the others refused to let me leave that abyss as they are afraid that I’ll destroy the balance of this world. But now, I’ve suppressed my strength, and I’m hiding in this pagoda of yours. So, we can go there now!”

Destroy the balance of this world!

Yang Ye had a rather strange expression on his face while he wondered how strong she actually was!

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts and asked, “Little Qi, I’ve been curious for some time now. You don’t seem to be from Eternal Kingdom?”

Qi Bitian replied, “I never was!”

Yang Ye continued, “Which world are you from?”

Qi Bitian thought for a moment and shook her head, “It’s gone.”

Yang Ye frowned, “Gone?”

She shrugged, “It was blasted apart during the battle.”

Yang Ye was stunned speechless.

Meanwhile, she asked again, “So are you coming?”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and said, “Alright!”

Qi Bitian immediately revealed a brilliant smile. Meanwhile, Yang Ye said, “So, Little Qi, I won’t die there, right? I can understand facing some danger, but I don’t want to get killed in an instant on arrival!”

He wasn’t one to keep asking about something, but he really wasn’t confident in Qi Bitian. She was unreliable, just like Snowy and Erya!

Very unreliable!

She glanced at him, “I guarantee you won’t die, alright?”

Yang Ye instantly put on a serious expression, “Now that you’ve said that, I’m willing to do anything!”

She shot a sideways glance at him and just gazed at him like that…

Presently, Yang Ye urgently needed to grow stronger, so he chose to take a look at that damn place she’d mentioned. He knew that it would definitely not be so easy, but he still chose to go!

He didn’t have a better choice!

After making arrangements for the Ancient Sword Sect, Yang Ye set off!

His destination—Eternal Kingdom’s Origin!
