Chapter 2425 – I Was Unmatched Once Too!

At the Abyss World, the woman gazed at the middle aged man before her and frowned slightly, “Who are you?!”

The middle aged man glanced at the woman’s group, and then he took a step forward.

A wave of pressure slammed down upon them.

Bang!

The woman was instantly blasted over 3km away!

Their expressions changed drastically from this.

The middle aged man glanced indifferently at them, “Leave this place! Now!”Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

She bowed slightly to him, “Farewell!”

She didn’t hesitate to leave with the others once she finished speaking.

The middle aged man glanced to the right. A sickly young man and an old man were there.

It was the desolate race’s Ninth Prince, Huang Ying.

Huang Ying bowed slightly to the middle aged man, “Farewell!”

He turned around and left with the old man.

The middle aged man turned around and left as well.

Outside the Abyss World.

As soon as the group left the area, a wisp of blood seeped out from the corner of her mouth, and a solemn expression covered her face.

It was extremely solemn!

She glanced at the Abyss World while fear filled her eyes!

She was a peak Four World Realm expert, but she was very well aware that she would definitely die if the middle aged man attacked her!

His strength far surpassed her own!

She closed her eyes slowly, “I didn’t expect such an expert!”

One of the experts behind her suddenly asked, “Is he above the Limitbreaker Realm?”

She shook her head, “He surpasses that.”

Surpasses it!

Just that shocked all of them.

Meanwhile, she suddenly said, “He may be even stronger than that!”

They were stunned speechless.

At the other side. Huang Ying stopped. At this moment, there was a solemn expression on his face and eyes too.

His eyes narrowed slightly, “I didn’t expect such an expert to be in this world!”

The old man spoke solemnly from behind him, “Does he surpass the Limitbreaker Realm?”

Huang Yin shook his head slightly, “I’m afraid that’s not all…”

That’s not all!

Huang Ying shot a glance downward, “It’s fine, let’s just wait!”

He vanished on the spot with the old man.

At the bottom of the abyss.

The middle aged man returned to Yang Ye and An Nanjing.

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and said, “Sorry for causing you trouble!”

The middle aged man shook his head, “That isn’t trouble. They aren’t qualified to be considered that!”

Yang Ye was stunned speechless.

The middle aged man continued, “Let me emphasize one last time. You must never forget that your objective is the stellar ocean, and your enemies are none other than yourselves. A person’s greatest enemy in life is themselves. I’ve seen many, many experts, including Wu Ni and the owner of Executor. All of them lost to themselves.”

“They lost to themselves?” Yang Ye frowned slightly, “What do you mean?”

The middle aged man smiled, “You’ll understand one day.”

He gazed at An Nanjing and continued, “Three days, that’s enough for you to inherit everything I know. At that time, you can leave.”

She nodded.

After that, An Nanjing started learning everything from the middle aged man while Yang Ye cultivated madly.

Flying swords!

Yang Ye’s focus was on his flying swords, Sword Domain, and madness intent!

Madness intent!

It was quite an intriguing form of intent because its strength was determined by how insane he was. The more insane he got, the stronger it would be; and the clearer his mind was, the weaker it would be. It could be said that if he entered into a mad state, the strength of his flying swords and Sword Domain would improve by around 50%!

Simply speaking, if he used Executor right now, he was barely strong enough to fight a Four World Realm expert!

However, if he used his madness intent, then he wasn’t any weaker to a Four World Realm expert and may even be able to kill such experts. Unfortunately, he couldn’t control it!

In the Primordial Pagoda.

While Yang Ye and An Nanjing were cultivating, Snowy wasn’t relaxing either. However, she didn’t cultivate. Every day, she would go to the rear mountains of the Sword Sect, where the two Chaotic Fruit Trees were. Now, she didn’t just use Primordial Violet Energy and Eternal Energy to nurture them, she used Eternal World Crystals and her own unique spirit energy too.

It could be said that not to mention those Chaotic Fruit Trees, even a pig could be nurtured into a Primal Demon if it was nurtured like this.

The Chaotic Fruit Trees were growing taller and larger. At this moment, they were around 1.5m tall, and there were six fruits on them. Four of the fruits were the size of an adult’s fist, and they were ripe.

As for the other two, they were still quite small.

Actually, the Chaotic Fruits could be said to have been forcefully matured and ripened by Snowy with the help of various types of energy.

Snowy revealed a brilliant smile when she saw that four of them had ripened. So, she called Oxxy, the Primal Vicious Tiger, Martial Qilin, Primal True Dragon, and Erya over.

They couldn’t help but stare when they saw the two trees.

Erya blinked, walked over to Snowy’s side, and patted Snowy’s little tail, “Snowy, well done!”

Snowy cracked a smile and waved her little paw. The four ripe fruits fell off the trees and flew over to Snowy.

Snowy sniffed them lightly, and then she passed one to Erya.

Erya gazed at Snowy, “Is this for me?”

Snowy nodded.

Erya hesitated for a moment and spoke very seriously, “Snowy, you’re a really good friend. I’m very poor now, so I have nothing to give you. But don’t worry, your problems are my problems from now on!”

Snowy cracked a smile, and then she raised the fruit at Erya again. Erya didn’t refuse it and accepted it.

As she gazed at it, a smile curled up on her lips. Presently, she really, really needed all sorts of natural treasures, but only divine treasures like the Chaotic Fruit were up to her standards.

After she gave one of the fruits to Erya, Snowy brought one to Oxxy and passed it to Oxxy. The latter glanced at Snowy, hesitated for a moment, and took it.

Snowy gazed at the Primal True Dragon, and then she flicked one over to it.

The Primal True Dragon gazed at Snowy for a long time, and then it nodded and took the fruit.

There was one last fruit!

Snowy put the fruit away. However, she didn’t forget the Primal Vicious Tiger and Martial Qilin.

Snowy pointed at them, and then pointed at the two trees. There were two more fruits there, so she was telling them to wait until those fruits ripened.

The Primal Vicious Tiger and Martial Qilin glanced at the fruits and nodded. They were satisfied as long as they got one. Moreover, those two fruits weren’t very far off from ripening. It would take a few days at most.

Erya and the others ate their fruits, and then they returned to their own territories.

In an instant, numerous unstable auras arose within the pagoda.

As for Snowy, she took the last fruit to the mountain where Zi’er lived. Zi’er grinned when she saw Snowy and embraced Snowy.

Snowy raised the fruit in her direction. Zi’er gazed at it in silence.

After she consumed that piece of fruit the other day, she’d attained the World Lord Realm!

Just a single part of a fruit had allowed her to jump through so many realms of cultivation! Now, she had a whole fruit. If she consumed it, she would definitely attain the Limitbreaker Realm and may even attain the Two World Realm!

Zi’er didn’t hesitate to take it. Once she saw Zi’er consume the fruit, Snowy pranced off into the distance.

In the hall, a powerful aura surged out of Zi’er’s body.

Outside the hall, Snowy gazed into the sky, and then a wisp of bewilderment gradually appeared in her eyes.

Snowy was getting more and more sensible in the end.

Recruiting demons, nurturing the Chaotic Fruit Trees, and searching for treasures… Some would think Snowy was just being mischievous, but in actuality, weren’t all of her actions helping Yang Ye in their own way?

A short while passed before Snowy shook her head and vanished into the distance.

She went to the 2nd level of the Primordial Pagoda.

In the cultivation room, Snowy floated in midair while the Primordial Axe of Creation, True Energy Mirror, Seal of Suppression, Myriad World Diagram, Sword Supreme, Sword Precursor, Sword Gourd, and Eternal Energy floated before her.

Besides Executor, all Yang Ye’s treasures were here.

Snowy glanced at them, and then she grabbed the Eternal Energy and swallowed it.

She was nurturing it!

She planned to nurture it herself. Because she felt that Yang Ye took too long. Actually, it wasn’t that Yang Ye was slow, it was she who was too fast.

Once it entered her body, the Eternal Energy started to circulate madly within her.

It was excited!

It was extremely excited!

Even though Eternal Energy was very rare, it was just a strand of energy before Snowy!

Snowy patted her stomach to tell the Eternal Energy to be quiet, and it didn’t take long for it to quiet down.

Snowy gazed at the Divine Treasures before her. She glanced left and right, and in the end, she just opened her mouth. In an instant, countless strands of pure spirit energy surged out like a torrent toward them.

Sprite Ascension!

Since Snowy discovered that she could make them grow in strength, she’d been helping them with Sprite Ascension from time to time!

All of these treasures were Yang Ye’s, so the stronger they became, the better it would be for Yang Ye!

Even though Snowy couldn’t improve these Divine Treasures to become Super Divine Treasures, she could make them approach that level!

Just like that, days went by.

In the blink of an eye, it had been three days.

At the bottom of the Abyss World, Yang Ye and An Nanjing bowed slightly to the middle aged man, and the latter roared with laughter. Meanwhile, the spear behind him suddenly appeared in front of An Nanjing.

An Nanjing gazed at the middle aged man, and the latter smiled, “It has no name, but people call it Nameless. It has been with me for many years. While I do not need any treasures anymore, I couldn’t bear to leave it behind. So, I’ve been keeping it with me. Now, it’s yours.”

An Nanjing hesitated for a moment, and then she nodded and put it away. The spear seemed to tremble in response.

Yang Ye gazed at the middle aged man, “Farewell!”

The middle aged man smiled, “Go on, I have a guest!”

Yang Ye nodded and gazed at An Nanjing. The latter bowed to the middle aged man like a disciple would bow to their master, and then she left with Yang Ye.

Not long after they left, a sword cultivator in a cloud white robe and a sword in his grasp walked into the Abyss World. She went to the middle aged man.

The sword cultivator gazed at the middle aged man for a short while and shook his head, “What a pity!”

The middle aged man smiled, “I can still fight, can’t I?”

The sword cultivator nodded, “Do it!”

The middle aged man smiled and looked up at the sky, “You know… During that chaotic time, if it were in terms of the Spear Dao, then destiny may have had 70% of it, but I had the other 30%. All those years ago, I too was once unmatched!”

As soon as he finished speaking, his figure suddenly shook, and then a spear gradually appeared from within his forehead.

An instant later, a spear was pointed at the sword cultivator!

This spear contained too, too many things. As soon as it appeared, the entire Abyss World instantly turned ethereal, and then it vanished completely like it had evaporated!

The entire Abyss World was gone!

It could endure the strength of this attack!

Meanwhile, the sword cultivator drew his sword.
