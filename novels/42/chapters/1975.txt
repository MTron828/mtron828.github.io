Chapter 1976 – Fuck You!

60 immortal crystals!

Needless to say, it was quite a precious gift!

No one cared about 60 immortal crystals in the outside world, but it may cause numerous battles in this place! FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

A’Man put the spatial ring away and looked up at the sky.

Only the marks left behind by Yang Ye remained there.

He’d gone.

She fell silent for a long time, and then she suddenly said, “We’ll meet again very soon!”

…

Hell Forest.

It didn’t take long for Yang Ye to arrive before Hell Forest, and he didn’t hesitate to enter it.

This time, Yang Ye didn’t travel carefully like he had before this. It wasn’t that he looked down on the dangers in this place, and he was just confident.

Perhaps it was because it was daytime, but Yang Ye didn’t encounter any danger after traveling for a long time.

However, he didn’t let his guard down.

Suddenly, a black shadow shot up into the air from the ground.

Yang Ye glanced at it with a calm expression on his face. Suddenly, it shot towards him. Yang Ye twisted his foot lightly, and then a few dozen afterimages instantly appeared.

Three breaths of time later, all the afterimages vanished.

There was a corpse in front of Yang Ye.

It had the body of a snake and the face of a person.

He’d encountered such a beast in the past, and it had been quite difficult for him to deal with it. Yet now, he could kill one in an instant!

Yang Ye glanced at the corpse and continued forward.

This time, he didn’t encounter more of these beasts.

It was peaceful all along the way!

Two hours later, Yang Ye emerged from Hell Forest, and a boundless mountain range appeared before him.

Yang Ye was about to continue forward, but he suddenly looked to the right. There was a 300m long sword there.

A red ‘兵’ character was inscribed on it!

The Weapon Path? Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and walked over. It didn’t take long for him to arrive in front of it. Suddenly, an ethereal figure flashed out from within it.

Yang Ye was stunned, “It’s you!”

The ethereal figure before him was the middle aged man who’d given him the Six Slaughters of the Weapon Dao!

“What took you so long?” The middle aged man continued, “Were you making a baby over there?”

Yang Ye was about to speak when the middle aged man pointed at the boundless mountain range, “Do you know why those experts and demons dare not come over here?”

Yang Ye shook his head.

The middle aged man pointed at himself, “Understand now?”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

The middle aged man continued, “Southern Qilin Mountain is the last place of inheritance for our Weapon Path’s Slaughter Line. So, I naturally can’t allow those fellows and demons to destroy it. Thus, I left a piece of my soul to guard this place.”

Yang Ye asked, “Senior, can I ask you if you’re dead or alive?”

The middle aged man fell silent for a short while and replied, “We’re the only two left in the Slaughter Line of the Weapon Path.”

Yang Ye spoke in a low voice, “Senior, you’re so strong, so why don’t you take revenge yourself?”

“Revenge?” The middle aged man shook his head, “To be honest, I’ve never thought about taking revenge!”

Yang Ye said, “Didn’t you ask me to take revenge?”

“That’s you!” The middle aged man looked Yang Ye in the eyes, “But I’ve never thought about doing it!”

Yang Ye’s face darkened, and he felt like cursing the middle aged man.

Meanwhile, the middle aged man added, “Kid, while I’m alive, the Weapon Progenitor is keeping a close eye on me. Because the Slaughter Line is gone, and he won’t allow the Weapon Path to lose another line. However, how can we just let all 1,670 people of the Slaughter Line die for nothing?”

Yang Ye asked, “So you want me to take revenge?”

The middle aged man smiled, “Kid, why have you suddenly become so stupid? Revenge? Can you? The line which annihilated our Slaughter Line is the strongest amongst the 5 lines right now. Any one of their experts can obliterate you!”

Yang Ye asked, “Then what do you want?”

The middle aged man looked Yang Ye in the eyes, “I left my inheritance in this damnable place and waited so many years for someone capable of rebuilding my Slaughter Line.”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Rebuilt it?”

The middle aged man nodded, “The Weapon Progenitor refuses to let me take revenge, but he doesn’t refuse to let me rebuild the Slaughter Line. So, the only way I can take revenge is to rebuild the Slaughter Line, and then win the battle between Paths. Only then can I fight that line in the Weapon Path!”

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and replied, “Senior, why do I have the feeling that it can’t be trusted!”

The middle aged man shrugged, “Actually, I think so too, but I still want to try. Otherwise, I’ll never be able to rest at ease!”

Yang Ye felt speechless.

The middle aged man added, “I’ve been waiting in this damnable place for so long, yet I never met anyone that satisfied me, until I met you. I knew that you were the one I was waiting for.”

Yang Ye was quite embarrassed, “It can’t be helped. I’m too outstanding. Even I am troubled by it!”

“Not at all!” The middle aged man spoke bluntly, “I didn’t choose you because of how great your natural talent is or how extraordinary your destiny is, and you’re even entangled with many types of karma. I chose to go to an extreme because it’s impossible to rebuild my Slaughter Line with ordinary means. So, I found someone entangled with numerous types of karma to be the Seal Master of my Slaughter Line!”

Yang Ye’s expression was absolutely unsightly.

Meanwhile, the middle aged man added, “Kid, see, I’m being very frank, right? What I’m trying to tell you is that while you’ll encounter a huge amount of trouble from becoming the Seal Master of my Slaughter Line, I’m sure you’ve seen how great the benefits are. Your current strength isn’t just a little stronger than what it was, right?”

Yang Ye fell silent.

Since the ancient times, nothing has ever been given for free. If you gained something, you had to pay as well. Yang Ye understood that principle!

The middle aged man said, “Kid, you possess the Dao Path’s inheritance, and now you’ve inherited my Weapon Path’s inheritance. Moreover, there are all sorts of karma coiled around you. Especially one of them, even I am quite worried about it. However, I can’t do anything about it as well!”

“Why?” Yang Ye hurriedly asked, “If you can see something that’s disadvantageous to me, feel free to act against it. I don’t mind!”

The middle aged man shook his head slightly, “There are some things that others can’t interfere with, or it’ll get very troublesome. It won’t just be a little bit troublesome! All I can do is let you inherit my line in the Weapon Path, and I can only take responsibility for that. Everything else is your business with them.”

Yang Ye suddenly asked, “Senior, aren’t you afraid that I’ll refuse to help you?”

The middle aged man chuckled, “I’ve thought of that, of course. Kid, it’s impossible for you to do that. Because I’ve written your name in the register of our Slaughter Line. Simply speaking, there are records of you in the Weapon Path. Even if you don’t want to do anything, the Weapon Immortal’s line won’t let you. You’ll have a chance to survive if you join forces with me. Otherwise… Hehehe…”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

Meanwhile, the middle aged man suddenly asked, “You have a group of friends over there?”

Yang Ye nodded, “Why?”

The middle aged man explained, “The inheritance in Southern Qilin Mountain has been taken, so my soul’s presence here is meaningless. Once I vanish and this place isn’t protected by me anymore… Hehe, the demon beasts and those fellows on the other side will have nothing to worry about! They will definitely charge over here and occupy the last paradise here!”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Paradise?”

The middle aged man nodded, “Southern Qilin Mountain, Sky Residence City, and the other areas around here might seem like they have no spirit energy, but the environment here is actually very good. Especially Southern Qilin Mountain. There’s even a spirit vein here. While there are spirit veins out there, and there are quite a few of them, there aren’t enough for everyone. So, once I stop protecting this place, those fellows will charge over.”

Yang Ye asked, “Are they very strong?”

The middle aged man replied with a question, “Do you know why the quality of the experts here is much higher than the world outside?”

He didn’t wait for Yang Ye to answer and continued, “Because this place is brutal. This place is hell. Those who can survive here are definitely extremely ruthless to themselves, and this ruthlessness is something the people outside don’t possess. That’s why those old bastards from the other races snuck in here and sealed this damnable place. It was to stop the people here from leaving!”

Yang Ye frowned, “It was the doing of all the races?”

“What else?” The middle aged man laughed coldly, “Did you think the people here would be so dumb as to seal themselves in this place?”

Yang Ye asked, “Senior, how long before you vanish?”

The middle aged man replied, “Anytime!”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and said, “Can you wait a little longer? My friends are still in Sky Residence City. If you leave, they’ll be in a terrible situation.”

The middle aged man fell silent for a short while and said, “A month, a month at most. I’ll vanish automatically after a month. Because my main body severed his connection with me after you received my inheritance. Without the energy transferred over from my main body, I won’t be able to last for long!”

A month!

Yang Ye nodded, “That’s enough. I’ll go get the 12 swords of slaughter now. Right, er… it’s not dangerous, right?”

The middle aged man’s expression was slightly strange, but it didn’t take long for it to return to normal. He said, “It should… it should be safe.”

“It should? Senior, you’re not sure? You…” Yang Ye wanted to say more, but the middle aged man suddenly said, “I can’t stay for long. My energy is insufficient. I must sleep in order to preserve my energy! Good luck!”

The middle aged man vanished once he finished speaking.

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

A long time passed before Yang Ye raised his middle finger at the sword, “Fuck you!”
