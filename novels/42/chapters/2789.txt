Chapter 2790 – An Unstoppable Sword!

The Fate Dao!

The area suddenly fell silent.

However, in the sky above the floating city in the Four Dimensional Universe, Justice was descending slowly. The powerful aura it emanated caused the world to warp before it!

Countless experts were looking at the sword from within the city!

All of them felt only despair before that sword!

That woman again!

Some of the older experts here recognized that sword. All those years ago when the Four Dimensional Universe planned to take over the Three Dimensional Universe, it was that woman who’d come here to their universe.

Those who hadn’t experienced that battle would never know how terrifying she was!

No one could stop her sword!

It was this same sword that had suffocated the Four Dimensional Universe for thousands of years!

Now, that sword was here again!

When Justice was about to strike the city, the shadow suddenly said, “I’ll do it.”

Justice suddenly stopped above the city, but just a moment later, it slashed down at the city.

Hiss!

A ray of sword energy entered the city, and countless shrill cries resounded throughout the city.

At least a quarter of the city’s residents had been killed by this attack!

In an instant, blood flowed into rivers throughout the streets.

A monstrous aura suddenly erupted from the shadow and slammed down at the woman. She didn’t move, but the aura vanished as soon as it passed the Go board. It was like the aura had never been there!

She put down another piece and said, “That was punishment for you.”

The shadow fell silent for a short moment and sat down again.

The woman smiled, “I know you want to kill me, and you’ve made some preparations. To be honest, I look forward to it a little.”

The shadow didn’t say anything in response and just gradually turned ethereal. A moment later, he vanished from her vision.

Meanwhile, Justice descended on the Go board.

She picked up the sword, walked over to an empty area, and then started practicing with the sword.

Stab, flick, swing, slash, chop, angled slash…

They were all basic moves, and there was nothing special about them.

But if one looked carefully, one would notice that every swing contained a certain Sword Dao!

Throughout these countless years of the past, the woman had comprehended numerous Sword Daos!

Meanwhile, she swung her sword again. This attack was a straight stab, but it carried an intent to fight until the end!

The Sword Dao of Fate!

She suddenly put her sword away and shook her head slightly, “It lacks a little something when compared to him! However, it’s understandable. After all, no one can make me have the resolve to decide our fate in one clash!”

She sat down before the Go board, and the sword automatically descended before the board.

…

Universe City.

Yang Ye returned to the city without making a sound. Only Ding Shaoyao knew that he was back.

In Ding Shaoyao’s room, she spoke softly, “How is the situation out there?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “It’s bad!”

It wasn’t that he was being pessimistic, but the situation was bad. Even at his current level of strength, he still felt the Three Dimensional Universe had no chance!

Ding Shaoyao fell silent.

Yang Ye smiled, “Do you have any ideas?”

She shook her head, “No, I don’t.”

Yang Ye spoke softly, “Take the God race and leave!”

Ding Shaoyao’s petite figure trembled.

A short while later, Ding Shaoyao shook her head, “I’ve already given my everything to the God race!”

She looked up at the man who stood before her, “This time, you live, then I live; and if you die, I die!”

Yang Ye sighed softly and didn’t say anything else.

A short while later, Yang Ye left the room. He went into the city, and he noticed that the atmosphere here was extremely oppressive.

While Universe City had constantly resisted the pressure it suffered from the outside world, everyone knew that wasn’t the end of it.

The storm was still on its way!

Yang Ye walked slowly through the streets.

The entire street was empty, and he only saw a few people walking through it from time to time. Moreover, they were rushing through as if they were in pursuit of someone.Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Even Universe City has started to fall into chaos!

Yang Ye continued forward slowly, just all by himself.

The living beings! The Heaven Dao!

These words suddenly appeared in Yang Ye’s mind.

Yang Ye had come all the way here from an absolutely small world, Profounder Continent, and he’d experienced all sorts of things along the way!

At this moment, he felt like human life was worthless!

Regardless of whether it was at Profounder Continent, the Radiant Dimension, Eternal Kingdom, or any other world he’d been to… The lives in those worlds had been so worthless and insignificant!

Perhaps two extraordinary experts would clash in battle, and then everyone else would perish as a result of it. And those extraordinary experts felt no pity toward those lost lives.

In the eyes of the strong, the lives of the ordinary were insignificant like ants!

Yang Ye suddenly withdrew a scripture and flipped it open. In the scripture, a row of words appeared before him, “The heavens fails to control the Grand Dao completely, and there is a way to escape…”

Yang Ye suddenly frowned, “The heavens fails to control the Grand Dao completely, and there is a way to escape. That means it is imperfect. Destiny escaped by surpassing herself and the Dao… If man and Grand Dao merge, then it is perfection of the Grand Dao… The true Grand Dao isn’t transcendence… And… and…”

Yang Ye’s frown deepened at this point.

What else?

It was like he’d sensed something but failed to grasp it.

Yang Ye’s gaze gradually became blank. Meanwhile, the Sword Precursor suddenly left its sheath and floated before him.

Bang!

Suddenly, a huge explosion resounded in the sky above Universe City.

In practically an instant, everyone in the city looked up.

A huge black vortex had appeared in the sky above the city, and it was emanating strands of terrifying pressure that seemed capable of obliterating the world.

Everyone in the city felt a strand of lethal and suffocating pressure!

“Activate the formation!” A voice resounded in the city.

Along with that command, a huge circle of light appeared in the air above the city. The circle of light didn’t cover the entire city. It was only around 300m wide, and it was many times smaller than the black vortex!

However, it emanated an aura that wasn’t any weaker to the black vortex!

Their invisible energy started to collide madly in the sky above the city.

Meanwhile, all the Destiny Realm experts converged in Universe Hall.

Huang Ying practically immediately asked upon meeting Ding Shaoyao, “Where’s Brother Yang?”

Yang Ye was their pillar of support!

Ding Shaoyao shook her head, “He’s in the city, but he seems to have entered into a profound state. It’s best not to disturb him!”

Huang Ying and the others nodded. While they wanted Yang Ye to be here, they were very well aware that sword cultivators had moments of sudden enlightenment. If they were to disturb him now, it would be very bad for him. Moreover, if Yang Ye benefitted from this enlightenment, it would be extremely beneficial to Universe City!

Ding Shaoyao raised her hands and pressed them down in order to indicate that the others should calm down and let her speak, “Calm down.”

They gazed at her, and she sat down before speaking, “Allow me to be honest. At this point, we have no other choice. Fighting to the death is our only way out. Of course, if anyone wants to flee for their lives, please feel free to do so. I guarantee that we won’t stop you. Not only will we not stop you, even Yang Ye won’t do anything to you because of your decision. I can guarantee all of that!”

A black robed old man suddenly stepped forward and said, “Miss Ding, just tell us how we should fight them!”

A middle aged man nodded, “To be honest, everyone wants to live, but we are very well aware that the Four Dimensional Universe is out there, and Destiny stands above us all. So, how would we possibly survive? Drag out our existence as we once did? In any case, I don’t want to live that life anymore! Besides that, during this time with Brother Yang, I finally understand why our strength is inferior to him! It’s because he dares to fight!”

He shook his head and smiled, “I don’t want to cower again. If I die, I die. At the very least, it won’t be that aggrieving!”

The old man nodded slightly, “I’ve had too many days like that. Now, I really don’t want to go back to that. Miss Ding, since Brother Yang isn’t here, you can make the decisions!”

Ding Shaoyao glanced at them, and none of the others raised any objections.

Ding Shaoyao felt quite gratified because Yang Ye had done so much for the universe and this city. So, if these people really chose to leave, she would be disappointed, she would be disappointed for Yang Ye.

Actually, she’d been prepared to kill whoever dared to leave at a time like this. Even if it was against her own principles, and even if she would be breaking her own promise, she would still kill the person!

Yang Ye had done too, too much for this city.

He shouldn’t suffer such betrayal!

Ding Shaoyao gazed at Chen Dao’zi, “How long can the formation last?”

Chen Dao’zi fell silent.

Ding Shaoyao asked softly, “What is it?”

Chen Dao’zi shook his head, “If it’s just the black vortex, my formation can last a very long time. But if the Four Dimensional Universe attacks in full force…”

Suddenly, everyone looked out the hall, and then practically all the experts here left it.

All of them looked up, and they saw a middle aged man walking out of the black vortex!

Monarch Yan!

Every step he took caused the world to tremble violently.

Meanwhile, Monarch Yan took another step.

Crack!

Everyone watched as the huge circle of light above the city suddenly cracked apart.

Chen Dao’zi was shocked, “He must be stopped! Get City Governor Yang!”

As soon as he said that, Jian Wudi spoke abruptly, “Don’t disturb him! I’ll help him stop that fellow for a moment!”

He vanished on the spot and then a ray of sword energy suddenly appeared high above.

Monarch Yan stopped. When the sword energy arrived around 3m away from him, his figure suddenly turned ethereal. A moment later, he appeared behind the sword energy, and the sword energy shattered soundlessly!

Jian Wudi’s figure stiffened behind the sword energy. It was because a hand had suddenly grabbed him by the throat.

It was Monarch Yan!

Monarch Yan’s eyes were filled with disregard, “Besides that woman, everyone else in the Three Dimensional Universe is just a useless dog!”

He squeezed down slightly as he finished speaking.

Bang!

Jian Wudi’s body exploded apart!

Dead!
