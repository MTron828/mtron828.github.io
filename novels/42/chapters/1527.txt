Chapter 1528 - I’m Bored Of Killing Rebirth Realm Experts!

Translator: InVader

Yang Ye didn’t know who the Blood Sword Demon was, and he didn’t care. Since that fellow had almost made him take blame for this, he naturally had to make that fellow take blame for something.

Of course, he would absolutely not reveal his real name. If he did that, then he would be pursued incessantly from now on. After all, he couldn’t just run back down to the lower dimensions if he couldn’t win a battle. Moreover, even if he wanted to run, he may not necessarily be able to succeed!

Presently, he couldn’t go head-on against them, so he had to be shameless!

Both of them were stunned when they heard Yang Ye. They hadn’t expected that Yang Ye would actually let them go, and they were even prepared to fight Yang Ye to the death. Of course, this was a good thing for them. So, they didn’t hesitate to turn around with the intention of leaving.

Suddenly, a wave of terrifying intent pressed down upon them!

Quasi Returnal Rank slaughter intent!

Their expressions changed drastically, and then they hurriedly sped up and vanished into the sky.

A smile curled up on the corners of Yang Ye’s mouth as he watched them flee, and then he looked at Qin Xue, “Lead the way! I’ll take both of you home!”

Qin Xue glanced at him, and then she pointed forward.

Yang Ye took their hands and vanished on the spot.

“Big Brother.” Meanwhile, the young boy suddenly looked at Yang Ye, “You didn’t do it. Why did you admit you did?”

Yang Ye smiled, and then he gazed at Qin Xue, “Do you know the reason?”

Qin Xue blinked, and then she said, “Big Brother definitely has enmity with the War Pavilion, right?”

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly. He gazed at her for a long time, and then he rubbed her head gently, “That little head of yours really isn’t ordinary. You’ll definitely be extraordinary when you grow up!” Even though she was still young, her intelligence was really quite high.

Qin Xue grinned, “Big Brother, you intended to clarify the situation, but as soon as you found out they were from the War Pavilion, you didn’t just stop trying to clarify everything, you even admitted that you were responsible. Moreover, you attacked decisively. Obviously, you have enmity with them. Otherwise, you would definitely not do that.”

Yang Ye smiled, “You guessed correctly. Right, why did you dare to run after me just now?”

“I think you aren’t a bad person!” She looked at him and said, “I struck you with that treasure of mine, but you didn’t get angry, and you didn’t attack us. So, I knew that you are a good person.”

“A good person?” Yang Ye chuckled, “I’m nothing of the sort!”

Qin Xue chuckled, “As far as my brother and I are concerned, you’re a good person.”

Yang Ye grinned as he shook his head, and he didn’t speak another word. Qin Xue was the main reason why he was helping them. Because the first thing she thought of in that situation hadn’t been herself, and it had been her younger brother instead. That moved him slightly. Moreover, saving these two children wasn’t difficult for him at all!

After that, Yang Ye asked Qin Xue about the large world. Even though she was very young, she knew quite a bit.

The large world was unlike the lower dimensions, and it didn’t have so many worlds. It only had a single continent, and it was called Sky Sky Continent. This name was quite strange, and that was exactly why everyone just called it the large world and not Sky Sky Continent.

Because there were many races in the large world, there were many territories on Sky Sky Continent. Every single territory was different. For example, the territory which the human race inhabited was called the Human Territory, the devil race lived in the Devil Territory, and the demon race lived in the Demon Territory. Even though there were many races and territories, five races were the strongest on the continent, and they had control over most of the resources on the continent.

These races were the human race, devil race, demon race, barbaric race, and oceanic race.

Even though there was friction between the five races, they didn’t enter into war. Because no one could afford a war. So, Sky Sky Continent was comparatively peaceful.

Yang Ye’s objective, the Divine Phoenix Clan, was in the Demon Territory. However, the Demon Territory was truly too far away from here. Even if he used a stellar teleportation formation, it would take around ten days at least. Moreover, it was very difficult for humans to travel deep into the demon race’s territory. If a human hadn’t been invited to the Demon Territory, all humans that enter the Demon Territory would be killed!

Qin Xue only knew that much. But just that information was sufficient for Yang Ye.

The forces of the human race in the large world were comparatively complicated. Because there were numerous clans and sects. Even though they governed their own sects and clans, the powers of the human race would immediately join forces if other races invaded their territory. However, if no other races invaded the Human Territory, then humans were mostly killing each other!

The incident related to the Nether Pavilion from all those years ago had caused the human race’s strength to decline tremendously!

Sects and clans that were strong would create their own pockets of space, and so did the Qin Clan. After traveling for a few hours, Yang Ye finally brought the two children to the Qin Clan.

Once they found out that the two children were here, a Rebirth Realm expert and ten Dualism Realm experts of the Qin Clan came to get them!

Yang Ye was quite surprised by this force. Obviously, the children’s status in the Qin Clan was very high!

“Grandpa!” Qin Xue and Qin Yuan immediately ran over when they saw the Rebirth Realm expert who led the group. The old man waved his right hand and took them in his arms.

Qin Xue suddenly grabbed the old man’s beard, and then her tears started pouring. As for Qin Yuan, he immediately started crying when he saw his elder sister crying.

Yang Ye was stunned when he saw Qin Xue crying so much, and then he shook his head and smiled, “No matter how smart she is, she’s still a little child!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he turned around and walked away.

Saving the children was purely a spur of the moment. Now that he’d send them home safely, he could deal with his own business.

“Wait!” Suddenly, a black robed old man appeared in front of Yang Ye.

Yang Ye gazed at the old man, “What?”

The black robed old man gazed at Yang Ye and said, “I don’t understand a few things, so please help me clear it up.”

Yang Ye nodded, “Go on.”

The old man asked, “Why are they with you?”

“Big Brother saved us!” Meanwhile, Qin Xue ran over, and then she explained what happened. The expressions of everyone here gradually eased up as they heard her.

The old man sized up Yang Ye. He frowned when he noticed that Yang Ye was just a Semi-Deity, and then he gazed at a middle aged man at the side, “Give him 100,000 divine crystals.”

The middle aged man nodded and flicked a spatial ring over to Yang Ye, “You can leave now!”

Yang Ye glanced at the spatial ring, and then he suddenly felt quite displeased. Because they were acting like they were sending off a beggar. It wasn’t that he felt the divine crystals were insufficient, it was their attitude which was the problem! They acted like they were very afraid Yang Ye would try to curry favor with them. He naturally understood that they intended to send him off casually because he was just a Semi-Deity.

Yang Ye chuckled, “100,000 divine crystals? Are those two little fellows worth just 100,000 divine crystals?”

The black robed old man gazed at Yang Ye when he heard this, and he just looked at Yang Ye for a long time before he said, “Then what do you think is a suitable amount?”

Yang Ye chuckled, “At least 10,000,000. Don’t you think so too?”

Everyone here was stunned when they heard Yang Ye. Obviously, they hadn’t expected Yang Ye to demand such an exorbitant amount. The black robed old man said, “Young man, it’s good to have ambition, but if ambition turns into greed, then it’ll make you lose your life. Understand?”

Yang Ye glanced at all the people here, and then he laughed with ridicule, “So clans are just filled with such trash!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he turned around and walked away.

Qin Xue seemed to want to say something. However, the black robed old man suddenly appeared in front of Yang Ye, “Are you insulting my Qin Clan?”

Yang Ye walked over to the old man and said, “If you thanked me sincerely, then not to mention 100,000 divine crystals, just a single thank you would have been sufficient. But just look at how you’re acting. You seem so afraid that I would try to cling to your clan. It’s truly disgusting.”

“How dare you!” The black robed old man was furious, and then he stretched out his hand to grab Yang Ye. Suddenly, Yang Ye’s sword vanished.

Bang!

The black robed old man was blasted away. At the same time, a ray of light flashed once more, and then everyone here was stunned.

The black robed old man wasn’t dead, and Yang Ye was standing in front of the old man. However, there was a sword pressed against the center of the old man’s forehead.

Everyone here was stunned.

A Semi-Deity defeated a Dualism Realm expert with a single move?

Yang Ye paid no attention to the black robed old man, and he turned around to look at Qin Xue who had a stunned expression on her face, “Little Fellow, let me teach you something. Remember it well. Never look down on others. Understand?”

Qin Xue nodded instinctively and said, “Big Brother, let Third Grandpa go, alright?”

Yang Ye grinned, “Alright!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he glanced at the people here and said, “I’m not bragging when I say that I can fight ten Dualism Realm experts!”

Suddenly, the only Rebirth Realm expert asked, “Then what if you brag?”

Yang Ye turned to look at that Rebirth Realm expert, “I don’t think I ever have!”

The old man replied, “Then give it a try!”

Yang Ye gazed at the old man for a long time before he said, “I’m bored of killing Rebirth Realm experts!”

Everyone here was stunned speechless.
