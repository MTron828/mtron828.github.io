Chapter 2124 – The Alliance of All’s Army!

Ding Shaoyao!

Yang Ye’s mind went slightly blank. Because he hadn’t expected her to actually be the god race’s strategist!

Ding Shaoyao was from the god race!

In his memories, she’d always been an extremely intelligent and gentle woman, but she was very weak. However, the facts proved that he was wrong. She wasn’t just extremely intelligent, she was extremely strong too.

In short, Yang Ye was really surprised.

At this moment, Yang Ye could see her face, and it was Ding Shaoyao’s face.

However, Ding Shaoyao didn’t seem weak like she had been, she seemed composed and slightly cold.

She glanced at Yang Ye and asked, “Are you that surprised?”

Yang Ye nodded.

She grinned, and then she looked at the man, “Xiao Hanyi, an extraordinary genius who shocked the large universe over a thousand years ago. Interesting… Looks like more and more people will be showing themselves.”

Xiao Hanyi placed his hands behind his back, “I didn’t plan to join in the fights of the ordinary world, but the god race’s actions are too inhumane! You actually plan to annihilate all the living beings in the Human Dimension. No one can survive when the whole is destroyed. Even if I die today, thousands more will stand up from my human race. The god race will never annihilate us.”

“Thousands?” Ding Shaoyao smiled, “Perhaps. However, it isn’t a big problem. My god race will kill all who come.”

As soon as she finished speaking, she glanced at the Sages behind Xiao Hanyi and said, “They’re already here. Isn’t anyone going to step forward and show them our strength?”

Suddenly, an extremely bloody aura appeared here, and then a man in a black cloak and red mask appeared by Ding Shaoyao’s side. He was holding a blood red scythe that was even larger than an adult man.

Blood was dripping from the scythe!

The man looked up at Xiao Hanyi, and then he shot up into the air. In an instant, a blood red crescent flashed through the air, and they entered into fierce battle.

As soon as they started fighting, the black energy in the surroundings swiftly moved to the surroundings, and even the Yin energy here reduced tremendously.

Ding Shaoyao didn’t look at their battle, and she gazed at the Sovereign of Sky’s group instead, “I’m quite surprised. I didn’t expect all of you to find us so quickly. However, if I’m not wrong, someone helped you, right?”

The Sovereign of Sky walked over to her, “Strategist Ding, let’s get even for the enmity of the past and the present.”

Ding Shaoyao nodded, “Alright!”

Boom!

As soon as she finished speaking, the ground shook violently, and then it cracked open. Numerous powerful auras shot up into the air, and then 17 people appeared behind Ding Shaoyao.

All of them were Sages!

17 Sages!

Needless to say, it was an extremely terrifying force!

However, that wasn’t the end of it. Electricity suddenly appeared all around the battlefield, and they formed a huge circle that surrounded the battlefield.

The Sovereign of Sky stared at Ding Shaoyao, “You were prepared!” Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Ding Shaoyao spoke indifferently, “I always plan for the worst. I planned to make more preparations before fighting all of you, but I’m afraid it’s too late now. However, that’s not a problem!”

The Sovereign of Sky nodded, “It’s not a problem indeed!”

He waved his right hand.

Step! Step! Step!

Suddenly, resounding footsteps came from afar. Yang Ye looked over and saw a group of demon beasts dashing over. They were shaped like tigers with wings on their backs, and every single one of them was over 100m tall. Besides that, there was a human standing on each of their heads.

Every single demon beast was at the Major Zen Realm, and the humans on them were at the Major Zen Realm too.

There weren’t many, just 100 of them!

However, the aura they emanated made them feel invincible. It was something that even a few Sages couldn’t compete with.

Logically speaking, Major Zen Realm experts were no match for Sages, but there were exceptions. Like Yang Ye. He could kill Sages. The Alliance of All had come prepared for this battle, and they’d selected their elites from both the human race and demon race. It could be said that this cavalry didn’t fear Sages at all.

It was the joint forces of humans and demons!

Besides that, beside the cavalry was a group of around 30 experts in pure white robes. There were men and women among them, and all of them held a pure white jade staff. They floated to the right of the cavalry, and the spirit energy here was visibly moving towards their army once they appeared here.

The spirit race!

All of them were at the Major Zen Realm! Moreover, every single one of them emanated an extremely formidable aura. They were Major Zen Realm experts who hadn’t relied on external forces to attain their current levels of cultivation!

Besides that, there were around 70 experts on the cavalry’s left. Every one of them wore golden armor and held a spear.

The aura they emanated was the strongest amongst everyone here if the Sages were excluded.

They were the Sky Guard that was renowned throughout the large universe.

The Sky Guard could be described as the sky race’s trump card. It was a mysterious team that never showed itself in the public eye, and it only obeyed the sky race’s patriarch. They used the best equipment and were provided with the best cultivation resources. So, their strength was naturally the best amongst the armies of the sky race.

Ten Sky Guards can slaughter a Sage!

It was a popular saying in the sky race, and it was no joke.

Since the Sovereign of Sky had even summoned this army of his, he was clearly ready to fight to the death.

However, this wasn’t the full strength of the Alliance of All. A few dozen black clothed experts appeared out of thin air.

All of them were Major Zen Realm experts!

All of their figures were extremely strange. They kept flickering and seemed like they weren’t material beings, and they emanated a wave of bone-piercing coldness!

Assassins!

Top-rate assassins from the shadow spirit race!

The shadow spirit race wasn’t a very well-known race in the large universe because they were very few. They were a small race of beings. However, since they could survive in this large universe, it was sufficient to prove their strength.

Assassins!

There was no other race that could compete with the shadow spirit race when it came to being assassins. They cultivated their shadows, and they could make their shadows a second life. So, they were born to be assassins.

Countless experts kept appearing here.

The human race, demon race, sky race, shaman race, spirit race, shadow spirit race, oceanic race, soul race…

At this moment, there were already 53 Sages on the side of the Alliance of All, and this didn’t include the Sages who were still hiding in the shadows. As for Major Zen Realm experts, they had around 1,300 in total!

It was an extremely shocking number!

Moreover, these Major Zen Realm experts had practically never relied on external forces to attain their current cultivations.

Besides that, all the races had even summoned the independent Sages and Major Zen Realm experts from their races.

After all, how could anyone survive alone if the whole was annihilated? Many understood that principle. If the Alliance of All lost, and the god race was allowed to get its revenge, then even if people from the other races survived, they would truly be dragging out their existences. Moreover, they wouldn’t be able to show themselves out in the open. So, countless experts were rushing towards the battlefield incessantly.

This battle would decide the fate of all the races!

Yang Ye’s face fell. The forces the other races revealed could be described as being sufficient to crush the god race. So, how would the god race fight them?

Presently, he finally understood why the Dao Path had made a compromise so easily. It was very simple, the joint forces of all the races was really very terrifying. Even the Dao Path didn’t want to go head on against them. While the Dao Path had a progenitor, even if the Dao Path won in the end, it would be a pyrrhic victory for the Dao Path. Moreover, if the Dao Progenitor didn’t help, the Dao Path’s strength was utterly insufficient before all the other races!

They were like a scattered clump of sand when they weren’t allied, and they weren’t a threat to the four paths at all. However, once they did join forces and form a real alliance, their joint forces was something that even a progenitor wouldn’t dare to look down upon.

United!

Once any force was truly united, it couldn’t be underestimated, and it was even more so for a group of forces!

“Fight?” The Sovereign of Sky said, “Strategist Ding, how will your god race fight out alliance?”

Ding Shaoyao looked up at the sky. Meanwhile, the spirit race’s patriarch waved his right hand, and the 30 plus spirit race experts behind him suddenly raised their hands. In an instant, invisible waves surged up into the sky. In an instant, the entire sky dimmed down like a gray cloth had covered it.

No one could see anything above them now!

The spirit race’s patriarch gazed at Ding Shaoyao and spoke indifferently, “We’ve witnessed the strength of your stellar formations, Strategist Ding. So, I don’t think you can converge stellar energy anymore now. I wonder if you have other methods to fight back. If you do, please use it so we can have a look.”

Ding Shaoyao smiled, “Looks like all of you really came prepared this time!”

“Of course!” The Sovereign of Sky said, “Our enemy is the god race. Strategist Ding, our forces are here, so what about yours? Or perhaps they dare not show themselves? However, I think they won’t do that. The god race is very proud, isn’t it?”

Ding Shaoyao didn’t answer him, and she gazed at Yang Ye instead, “Do you remember what you did in the past?”

Yang Ye asked, “What?”

Ding Shaoyao smiled, “That thing that you felt was really fun.”

Yang Ye frowned slightly as he didn’t understand what she meant.

Meanwhile, Ding Shaoyao closed her eyes slowly, “Do you think I didn’t know that while you were scheming against the other races, you were scheming against us too? If you hadn’t defected at the last moment all those years ago, my god race wouldn’t have been crushed. So, let’s get even for that too. Large universe, from today onward, this large universe will become history!”

Who was Ding Shaoyao talking to?

While everyone here was puzzled, the expressions of all the patriarchs from the other races had instantly changed drastically.

The Sovereign of Sky gazed at her and spoke with astonishment, “Has your god race gone mad?”
