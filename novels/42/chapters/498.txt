Chapter 499 – The True Heavenrend Drawing Technique!

An extremely terrifying strand of baleful energy and resentment charged into Yang Ye’s mind, and the impact of it almost caused him to lose himself. Fortunately, he hurriedly protected his heart and mind at the critical moment, and only then was he able to prevent all of that. However, it wasn’t great for him right now because the resentment and baleful energy was charging at his mind in waves!

Bang!

The Ninth Hell Swordwings on Yang Ye’s back flapped swiftly, and he transformed into a shadow that vanished at the horizon. Even though he was in a bad state, his mind was still slightly clear, and he knew that if he were to stay here while in such a state, then he would definitely die once someone arrived here!

Bang!

Yang Ye descended to the ground at an empty area, and the entire ground trembled violently. At this moment, Yang Ye’s entire body emanated a slightly beautiful red glow. Moreover, his hair had become maroon as well. His current appearance was extremely shocking and strange.

Bang!

A red glow suddenly surged explosively from within Yang Ye, and the ground before it cracked apart, inch by inch.

Yang Ye was delighted because he noticed that he could release the resentment and baleful energy from his mind in the same way that he released his Sword Intent. After that, Yang Ye released his Slaughter Sword Intent like a madman, and then waves of seemingly material red light sprayed incessantly from within him. Wave after wave surged off into the surroundings, and it caused the entire area to be covered in destruction.

Just like that, Yang Ye felt much better after he released the energy for around an hour.

Yang Ye slowly opened his eyes, and then two red rays of light shot out from his eyes and struck the ground before him, causing two bottomless holes to appear instantaneously. Yang Ye was stunned on the spot!

Yang Ye withdrew a mirror from his spatial ring, and he was stunned once more when he saw himself in the mirror. At this moment, his eyes were scarlet red like they had oceans of blood within them. Besides his pupils, his entire eyes were blood red in color. Moreover, his hair had become scarlet red now, and it seemed like it had been dyed with blood. It was extremely shocking!

Right, where’s the Pearl of Baleful Blood?

Yang Ye looked towards the surroundings yet didn’t notice the Pearl of Baleful Blood. Suddenly, he raised his hand and looked once more into the mirror, and then he was stunned again. A red colored tattoo that was in the shape of a pearl had suddenly appeared at the center of his forehead, and it was exactly how the Pearl of Baleful Blood looked like!

A ray of light flashed as the Sword Spirit appeared by his side. Yang Ye gazed at her and said, “What’s going on?”

She fell silent for a while before she said, “That Pearl of Baleful Blood absorbed the blood of too many experts and attained intelligence of its own. It was probably trying to make you suffer backlash. As for its objective, it was naturally to take control of you. But it never imagined that you possessed the Enlightened Sword Heart and had comprehended Slaughter Sword Intent as well. So, the baleful energy and resentment within it wasn’t much of a threat to you. Conversely, it even lost itself in the process and helped you improve your Sword Intent.”

“It improved my Sword Intent?” Yang Ye hurriedly utilized his Sword Intent, and then he was flabbergasted. Because there was no red glow, but he was able to sense that something seemed different around him. Meanwhile, the Sword Spirit suddenly said, “Stop quickly!”

Yang Ye gazed at her, and he saw her frowning and displaying a very uncomfortable expression. Yang Ye hurriedly said, “You....”

The Sword Spirit said after a while passed. “You’re attained the 9th level of Slaughter Sword Intent, and you’ve attained a level of incorporeal materiality. It means that your Sword Intent has fused into one with the heavens and the earth, so it doesn’t have an actual shape yet is material.”

When she spoke up to this point, the Sword Spirit glanced at Yang Ye with a strange expression on her face. “Moreover, your Sword Intent can even absorb the Sword Intent and sword qi of sword cultivators who are weaker to you. In short, your current Sword Intent is entirely capable of suppressing Exalt Realm experts. Because your Sword Intent has fused with the heavens and the earth, so it’s not simply an improvement of a single level. Besides that, the Pearl of Baleful Blood has fused into one with you. In other words, you’ll automatically absorb the blood of those you kill in the future to nurture your Slaughter Sword Intent. So, I’ve never witnessed such a situation as yours in the past, and I don’t know if it’s good or bad. However, there’s one thing that I’m sure of, you’re a true Sword Demon from now on!”

A Sword Demon? Yang Ye laughed with indifference. He flicked the index finger on his right hand, and then a large tree that was over 100m away was suddenly split into two. The smile on Yang Ye’s face gradually vanished and was replaced by shock because he hadn’t utilized any sword qi just now, and it was just a pure strand of Sword Intent. But he hadn’t imagined that strand of Sword Intent would actually really be invisible and much faster than the sword qi he executed!

Yang Ye pondered deeply for a moment before the sword chest behind him shook slightly. At the same time, a large tree that was over 100m away was suddenly split apart. Yang Ye’s pupils constricted when he witnessed this scene, but in next to no time, an overjoyed expression appeared on his face. Because he noticed that a Dao Artifact enveloped by his Sword Intent was actually invisible as well, and its speed had doubled at least!

9th level Sword Intent is actually that formidable!Right, it can even absorb the Sword Intent and sword qi of sword cultivators who are weaker to me? Hehe! I definitely have to test it out if I have the chance!“You’re the most... most inconceivable amongst all the Sword Emperors of the past!” Meanwhile, the Sword Spirit suddenly said, “Logically speaking, you shouldn’t have been able to attain 9th level Sword Intent right now because you haven’t attained the Exalt Realm and haven’t comprehended the energy of the heavens and the earth. However, you just happen to have attained it. I’m unable to imagine to what extent you’ll grow to in the future!”

“That’s a good thing, isn’t it?” Yang Ye smiled. 9th level Sword Intent was undoubtedly like timely assistance to him, and it gave him a little more confidence towards facing the difficulties he would have to face in the near future!

The Sword Spirit fell silent for a while before she asked. “Have you heard of the Heavenrend Drawing Technique?”

Yang Ye was stunned and said, “Of course I have, it’s a sword technique which was created by an elder of the Sword Sect. It helped me a great deal all those years ago. Unfortunately, my enemies grew stronger and stronger, and it wasn’t able to be of much help to me any longer. What about it?” 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

The Sword Spirit said, “It wasn’t created by an elder of the Sword Sect, it was the first Sword Emperor who created it. Later on, the Unfettered One learned the technique and passed it down to the sword sect.”

“It was created by the first Sword Emperor? Then why is it such trash?” Yang Ye was astounded.

The Sword Spirit glanced at him and said, “The Unfettered One almost slashed the Heavenpath into two with a single strike of that technique. You think it’s trash?”

Yang Ye didn’t say anything, but his face was covered in doubt. What a joke, he admitted that the Heavenrend Drawing Technique wasn’t bad, but he didn’t believe it had almost slashed the Heavenpath into two.

She said, “The reason it became so weak wasn’t because of the technique. It was mainly because all of you didn’t have me!”

“We didn’t have you?” Yang Ye was shocked.

She said, “The first Sword Emperor created it with me as the foundation, and it’s no different to an ordinary sword technique without me. But once you do have me, then it can really rend the heavens. Do you want to give it a try?”

Yang Ye nodded without hesitation.

She said, “Use Void Flash!” As soon as she finished speaking, she transformed back into the ancient sheath.

Yang Ye stretched out his hand and grabbed the ancient sheath before he placed Void Flash within it. In the next moment, Yang Ye suddenly drew his sword. After that... after that, he was stunned. Because he was actually unable to draw it.

Yang Ye took a deep breath, and the profound energy within his body surged violently into the ancient sheath, and then he drew Void Flash forcefully again. However, Void Flash didn’t move at all. Yang Ye’s expression changed a little, and he hesitated slightly before he poured his Sword Intent into the ancient sheath as well. Void Flash finally moved slowly when both his profound energy and Sword Intent were surging into the ancient sheath.

Yang Ye was delighted by this development, and he shouted as he suddenly drew Void Flash forcefully, and he drew it out halfway. It wasn’t that he couldn’t draw it out completely, it was because he’d suddenly stopped drawing it. The reason was that the sky had suddenly dimmed down while jet black clouds had appeared in the sky. Moreover, a few silver colored bolts of lightning were flickering incessantly.

Yang Ye was astounded. The weather actually changed just because I drew my sword? Moreover, Yang Ye faintly sensed that those bolts of lightning would strike down towards him if he were to continue drawing Void Flash from within the ancient sheath. Yes, he felt that those bolts of lightning had locked onto him!

Should I draw it or not?

Yang Ye shook his head and laughed bitterly. In the end, he didn’t draw Void Flash. Because just that moment of hesitation had caused the profound energy within his body to have been almost fully sucked away by the ancient sheath. Even though he could still draw Void Flash by force, it was meaningless. After all, it was truly unwise to exhaust all his profound energy just to witness the might of the Heavenrend Drawing Technique. If he was going to utilize that technique, then he definitely had to use it against an enemy!

However, Yang Ye grew more and more curious towards this technique. Exactly how terrifying is its might? Even the heavens are afraid of it? Could it really rend the heavens?

Yang Ye shook his head, and then his figure flashed towards the next city.

Yang Ye didn’t know that the news of what he’d done at Needless City had spread out at the same time.

“Have you heard? That Sword Emperor, Yang Ye, from the southern territory killed a few hundred in Needless City, and he even killed Exalt Realm experts. Moreover, the City Governor and his cavalry perished at Yang Ye’s hands. Tsk, tsk. He can even kill Exalt Realm experts!”

“What nonsense! He clearly killed a few thousand! I witnessed it with my own eyes! A few thousand profounders were killed at the entrance of Needless City from a single swing of his sword! Moreover, there were a few dozen Exalt Realm experts amongst them.”

“You’re spouting nonsense as well! He didn’t just kill a few thousand! I heard he slaughtered the entire city. At this moment, Needless City is covered in corpses and blood....”

“Hmph! A barbarian from the southern territory actually dares to kill without restraint at our central territory! Does he think there’s no one capable here? Is anyone willing to go with me and kill that barbarian from the southern territory? We’ll split the top-grade energy stones once he’s dead!”

“Alright! Let’s go kill that demon and get rid of evil for the people....”

Meanwhile, the Exalted Han Empire released another piece of news. It was that the person who killed Yang Ye would be rewarded with 5,000 top-grade energy stones, 2 mid-grade Heaven Rank techniques, 2 mid-grade Heaven Rank dark treasures, and the position of City Governor at a city with a million residents.

After that, the profounders of the central territory seethed once more with excitement, and they searched madly for Yang Ye....
