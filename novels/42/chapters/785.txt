Chapter 786 – I’m Yang Ye and Yang Man!

Since the Hallowed Halls wasn’t interfering, the Ancient City of Hallows could be said to be without order. Coupled with the fact that the defiant profounders were just outside the city and the shadow of death was looming above everyone. The inhabitants of the city had started to go into a frenzy.

In the beginning, many had started killing for the Saint Spirit Fruit. After all, chaos was upon them, and they could only survive if they possessed strength. But it didn’t take long for their killing to be unrelated to the Saint Spirit Fruit.

Since there was no order here, the wild ambition and selfish desires of people were gradually exposed.

A wisp of a resolute and ferocious expression flashed through Mu Qingfeng’s eyes as she watched Gu Yuexian and Lou Chongxiao charge over, and a powerful aura surged out from her, “Members of Lunar Rite Hall, fight to the death!” She was very clearly aware that they wouldn’t spare them even if they surrendered. Especially the female members of Lunar Rite Hall. So, they had no choice but to fight to the death!

“With just that little bit of strength?” Gu Yuexian and Luo Chongxiao charged over to Mu Qingfeng.

Her strength was sufficient to resist one of them, but she was facing both of them. Moreover, she wasn’t a match for Gu Yuexian at all, let alone their joint forces! So, it only took a single exchange of blows for her to be blasted flying.

“Hall Master!” The eyes of the countless members of Lunar Rite Hall almost split apart from rage when they saw their hall master being blasted away!

A mouthful of Blood Essence sprayed from her mouth. She was about to stand up when Luo Chongxiao stomped his foot against her stomach, causing another mouthful of blood to spray from her mouth.

Luo Chongxiao revealed a lustful grin to Gu Yuexian as he said, “Brother Gu, why don’t you go first?”

“Then I won’t decline! She’s clearly inexperienced. Perhaps I might be able to charge into the Half-Saint Realm by engaging in mutual cultivation with her!” A wisp of an evil smile appeared on the corners of Gu Yuexian’s mouth as he walked over to Mu Qingfeng.

Bang!

Suddenly, Gu Yuexian’s figure was blasted flying, and a loud explosion resounded as it smashed against the nearby entrance to the grand hall.

Everyone in the surroundings stopped moving, and they looked over towards the spot that Gu Yuexian stood on just moments ago. At this moment, a white haired man was standing there.

The man was naturally Yang Ye. He’d immediately rushed over when he heard that Lunar Rite Hall was in danger, and he wasn’t too late.

Yang Ye walked step by step towards Mu Qingfeng.

Luo Chongxiao’s eyelids twitched, and he spoke solemnly, “Who are you!?”

Gu Yuexian’s strength far surpassed his own, but Gu Yuexian wasn’t even able to fight back against this man who stood before him. So, it was obvious that he was absolutely no match for the white haired man as well.

Yang Ye paid no attention to Luo Chongxiao. He gazed at Mu Qingfeng and said, “I’m sorry for dragging Lunar Rite Hall and you down!”

“It’s you!” Mu Qingfeng’s eyes opened wide, and they were filled with disbelief.

Pu!

Meanwhile, Luo Chongxiao suddenly pressed his foot down, and another mouthful of blood sprayed from Mu Qingfeng’s mouth. Luo Chongxiao gazed ferociously at Yang Ye and said, “No matter who you are... I’ll kill this woman if you take another step forward! Trust....”

Luo Chongxiao’s voice stopped abruptly!

A hand was on his neck, and it was Yang Ye’s hand of course.

Luo Chongxiao’s eyes were opened wide, and his eyeballs that were filled with terror had almost popped out from their sockets.

“I don’t!” As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye’s hand squeezed down, and cracking resounded as the color in Luo Chongxiao’s eyes vanished.

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings and said, “What? All of you intend to stay and eat with us?”

“Don’t let them leave!” Mu Qingfeng spoke abruptly, and her voice was icy cold and filled with terrifying killing intent.

“In the future, alright?” replied Yang Ye. Yang Ye wanted to kill all of them as well. However, he knew that doing so would definitely alarm the Hallowed Grounds. At that time, it would become troublesome for him.

Mu Qingfeng hadn’t even finished speaking when the people in the surrounding retreated like a receding tide, and it only took less than 2 breaths of time for them to vanish.

Only Yang Ye and Mu Qingfeng remained in the grand hall of Lunar Rite Hall.

“I never expected that you would actually dare to come here again!” said Mu Qingfeng.

Yang Ye withdrew a 1,000 year old Firecrystal and gave it to her. She glanced at him and took it before she said, “You should leave as soon as possible. It’s dangerous to stay here!”

“Where are your grandfather and grandmother?” asked Yang Ye. He still remembered that Mu Qingfeng had a grandfather and grandmother at the Half-Saint Realm.

“They’re dead!” A wisp of killing intent flashed through her eyes, “They were still when disorder started to arise in the city. I know that it was definitely the Gu Clan and the Luo Clan. I went to seek help from the Hallowed Grounds, but they refused to do anything. Yang Ye, tell me what exactly is going on. Why has the city fallen into such a state?”

Yang Ye asked, “Do you trust me?”

She replied, “Who else can I trust?”

Yang Ye said, “Everyone beneath the Half-Saint Realm in the city might have to die!”

“It’s the Hallowed Hall behind it?” asked Mu Qingfeng.

Yang Ye nodded.

She asked, “Why?”

Yang Ye told her about the Hallowed Grounds’ plan.

A long time passed before she spoke again, “So that’s why. No wonder Saint Spirit Fruits appeared in the city, and no wonder the Hallowed Halls is remaining silent. No wonder.... So everything was part of their plan.”

Mu Qingfeng intended to leave when she spoke up to this point, but Yang Ye stopped her and said, “You intend to head out and expose their scheme?”

“Of course!”

Yang Ye shook his head and said, “Not to mention whether they would believe you, even if they did and joined forces to resist such a fate, do you think they would be able to resist the Half-Saints of the Hallowed Grounds? The only outcome would be that the people in the city would die even faster. Moreover, if you do expose it right now, then you’ll probably be killed in an instant!”

Mu Qingfeng fell silent for a long time, and then she asked, “Then what should we do? Should we just allow them to succeed?”

Yang Ye said, “Are you willing to head to Profounder Continent?”

Mu Qingfeng was slightly stunned, and then she fell silent for a long time before she said, “I am!” She didn’t know when she would die if she stayed, and she would even die at the hands of someone who was supposed to be on her own side. She didn’t have the ability to change such a fate, and all she could do was flee from it.

Yang Ye nodded and said, “I’ll take you out of the city later, and then you can head to Profounder Continent. You’re a member of the Hallowed Halls, so those experts who are guarding the teleportation formation will probably not stop you from traveling to Profounder Continent!”

She asked, “Then what about the others in the city?”

Yang Ye spoke indifferently, “Die!” He hadn’t come here to be their savior. He couldn’t stand by idly for Mu Qingfeng and the other members of Lunar Rite Hall, and that was because he owed them a favor. As for the others, they weren’t related to him at all!

Mu Qingfeng was at a loss for words.

Yang Ye said, “Chose some members of Lunar Rite Hall. It’s best if they are those you trust, and I’ll take all of you out of the city. Remember that they must be trusted. Don’t notify anyone you don’t truly trust, or it’ll end with their deaths.”

Mu Qingfeng nodded. She wasn’t a hesitant person, so she immediately turned around and walked out of the hall. It only took her less than 15 minutes to lead a group of people into the hall.

The corners of Yang Ye’s mouth instantly twitched because she’d brought over 300 people with her.

Mu Qingfeng seemed to realize that she’d brought a little too many people with her, and she said softly, “I was truly unable to bear to leave them behind.”

Yang Ye sighed softly, and then he glanced at them and spoke coldly, “I presume Qingfeng has told all of you about the situation. Now, those who are willing to leave the city with me can stay behind. As for the rest, you can leave.”

“Are you Yang Ye?” Suddenly, a voice sounded out. Yang Ye looked towards its source and saw Mu Ling standing there.

The gazes of the others descended onto Yang Ye when they heard her. After all, they’d heard so much about Yang Ye.

Yang Ye nodded and said, “I’m Yang Ye, and I’m Yang Man as well!”

Clamorous noise resounded as all of them gazed at Yang Ye at Yang Ye with disbelief, and it was like they were asking how he dared to come to the Hallowed Grounds!

“You... you actually dared to come to the Hallowed Grounds again....” Mu Ling spoke in a low voice.

Yang Ye waved his hand and said, “It isn’t the time to speak about all of that. My only question is whether all of you are willing to head to Profounder Continent. I can’t guarantee that all of you will definitely be able to live if you go there, but I guarantee that if you don’t betray Profounder Continent, then Profounder Continent won’t betray all of you.” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“I’m willing!” Mu Ling was the first to speak, “The Ancient City of Hallows isn’t the same city that we used to know anymore. Those who are strong can do as they please, and those who are weak can only suffer humiliation and death. Moreover, Gu Yuexian and Luo Chongxiao died here just now. I believe that the Luo Clan and Gu Clan will definitely dispatch experts to avenge them. We’ll definitely die when that happens!”

“Mu Ling is right! I’m willing to head to Profounder Continent as well!”

“Me too!”

None of them chose to stay in the city. Because the current Ancient City of Hallows was a city where those beneath the Half-Saint Realm might die at any moment!

Suddenly, the Sword Spirit appeared by Yang Ye’s side.

“This won’t do!” The Sword Spirit said, “Yang Ye, you can’t take so many people with you. The disappearance of so many people will definitely be noticed by the experts of the city. At that time, all of you will die!”

Yang Ye frowned as he hadn’t thought about that. Indeed, it was utterly impossible for him to lead so many people out of the city at one go! Place all of them within the Primordial Pagoda? That was a sound plan. But could he use such a method? Besides the people closest to him, he didn’t dare allow another soul to be aware of the Primordial Pagoda!

Yang Ye remained silent for a long time before he said, “I have a way to take all of you out of the city. However, all of you have to stay unconscious. To be honest, I can’t allow others to be aware of this method of mine.” It wouldn’t be a problem if they were unconscious before he placed them within the Primordial Pagoda.

Many of them were slightly hesitant because it was equivalent to putting their lives in the hands of another.

“I’m willing to do that!” Mu Qingfeng was the first to speak.

Sure enough, as soon as she made her stand clear, many others started voicing their agreement in succession.

Yang Ye gazed at the Sword Spirit, and the Sword Spirit nodded. She was just about to act when a voice suddenly resounded from outside Lunar Rite Hall, “How dare you kill a member of my Gu Clan! Die!”

Bang

As soon as that voice finished resounding, the entire Lunar Rite Hall collapsed while dust and dirt shot endlessly into the air!
