Chapter 2728 – Explosive Madness Sword Technique!

Snowy raised it to Yang Ye like she was presenting him a treasure!

Yang Ye sized it up carefully. It had actually turned dark gold!

There was faint dark golden light around the entire armor!

Yang Ye couldn’t help but touch it, and it felt quite cold.

Snowy waved her paws swiftly.

Yang Ye was stunned, “You added Erya’s scales in it?”

Snowy hurriedly nodded. Actually, she wanted more, but she noticed that Erya hadn’t grown many, so she’d just asked for a few small scales!

Erya’s scales!

Yang Ye and An Nanjing exchanged glances, and they were quite surprised!

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and withdrew Great Unknown, and then he used some force with it.

Clang!

A clear and loud clang resounded.

Sparks sprayed from the armor while a faint mark appeared on it, but it only took a moment for the mark to disappear!

Yang Ye’s expression finally changed at the sight of this!

It was absolutely terrifying!

After all, Yang Ye was holding Great Unknown!

Yang Ye raised the armor and scanned it carefully. It was very light, but it felt extremely solid.

It was very strong!

Meanwhile, An Nanjing said, “Erya’s defenses are very strong!”

Very strong!

She’d fought Erya in the past, and Erya’ defenses were truly too insane. In the past, she’d felt Yang Ye’s physical defenses were really good, but after she experienced Erya’s, she realized that Yang Ye’s was simply trash!

Now, Snowy had used Erya’s scales to upgrade the armor, so to a certain extent, it had undergone a qualitative transformation!

However, it wasn’t important, the important part was Erya!

Erya’s scales were already so terrifying, so how terrifying were her own defenses?

Could Destiny’s swords even slice through her defense?

Yang Ye wasn’t certain at all!

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts and wore the armor. A moment later, it merged into his body, and it automatically appeared with a single command in his heart!

It was a life-saving trump card to him!

If it hadn’t been for this armor, he would have been severely injured in the battle with Emperor Li. At that time, Zuo Mu and the others would definitely fight them to the death!

It could be said that the armor had really helped!

Yang Ye rubbed Snowy’s head gently and spoke softly, “Little fellow, it must have been exhausting for you lately!”

Snowy blinked, flew over to Yang Ye’s shoulder, wrapped her paws around his neck, and just rested her head against him.

She didn’t know much, but she knew that Yang Ye was in extreme danger every day.

So, the little fellow was trying her best to help him!

Now, she wasn’t the Good Sprite of the world, nor did she want to be the Good Sprite, she just wanted a life without worry, just like this!

Yang Ye rubbed her head gently and gazed at An Nanjing, “You know… No matter how tired I am, or how terrible my situation is, I feel everything is worth it when I think of all of you!”

She just gazed at him in silence.

A short while later, Yang Ye started healing after he put Snowy to sleep.

He had to recover to his prime!

After he recovered, he had to climb back up to the border of the Four Dimensional Universe!

He had to find Qi Bitian and Tian Xiu!

In the cultivation room, Yang Ye sat cross-legged on the ground, and An Nanjing was by his side. She suddenly said, “Why didn’t you use that move earlier?”

“That move?” Yang Ye was stunned for a moment, and then he understood what she meant.

The move he used to break into the Four Dimensional Universe!

The explosive version of Heavenrend and the Madness Sword Technique!

It was an extreme sword technique, a very extreme technique. Because it was practically a move that damaged him in the process. Even he couldn’t really control it, and it came with a certain amount of danger. If he failed to kill his opponent, he would be finished instead!

After all, he had to make his full strength erupt swiftly in an instant, and once that was done, he would fall into a period of weakness!

Yang Ye pondered deeply for a moment and said, “I’m keeping it for a critical moment!”

An Nanjing nodded and closed her eyes slowly.

He didn’t know what kind of trump card the End World was hiding, and the End World didn’t know what kind of trump card he was hiding.

Once he revealed all his trump cards, it would be the moment of his death!

Two hours later, Yang Ye had fully recovered!

Yang Ye left the Primordial Pagoda, looked up, and then a ray of light shot up!

A moment later, he’d left the 9th layer of space, and the border of the Four Dimensional Universe was before him. Just like before, countless strands of spatial energy swept toward him!

Yang Ye stood there on the spot with the Sword Supreme in his grasp!

Yang Ye started running forward while gaining speed, and he was much faster than the last time.

An explosive attack!

It wasn’t a true part of the Sword Dao, it was just an extreme technique he’d been forced to create upon being pushed into a corner!

If the side effects were disregarded, its strength was beyond doubt!

Just like that, Yang Ye grew faster and faster, and it didn’t take long for the space around him to be obliterated by his body!

Meanwhile, the spatial energy had arrived before him!

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly, and then he drew his sword and slashed repeatedly!

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!

Just like that, Yang Ye slashed like a madman, and layer after layer of the powerful spatial energy before him was sliced apart!

A short while later, Yang Ye could see the starry sky.

He was about to get there!

But at this moment, he suddenly stopped and retreated rapidly!

A short while later, he was back at the 9th layer of space!

Yang Ye sat down cross-legged and started recuperating!

He hadn’t entered the border of the Four Dimensional Universe because he wanted to train!

He hadn’t mastered this explosive method of attack that he’d created. Regardless of whether it was the speed at which he started the technique or the entire process of attacking, all of them weren’t perfect yet. They had huge room for improvement!

He wanted to fully master it and decrease the time required to execute it, and he wanted it reduced to the point he could execute it in a short while!

The spatial energy of the Four Dimensional Universe was his best training dummy! Moreover, while he could enter the border of the Four Dimensional Universe, he had to pay the price of tearing his body apart!

Once he got there and that pair of eyes was there, he would have to run for his life again!Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

So, he had to train until this move of his didn’t have any side effects!

Around two hours later, Yang Ye’s torn up body had healed!

His body could be described as having experienced a myriad of battles, and it was extremely tenacious! As for ordinary pain, he was already numb to that.

After recovering, Yang Ye stood up and charged toward the border of the Four Dimensional Universe again.

This time, he started extremely quickly. He wanted to combine the explosive force created by speed with the explosive force of Heavenrend, and then combine the two of them with his Madness Sword Technique. That short moment would be the moment he was most terrifying!

He wanted to train that ability to its limits!

In the spatial passageway, a figure charged forward swiftly. Besides a spatial rift, there were numerous simply material afterimages left behind the figure!

The afterimages were so real, but they were just afterimages!

“Break!” Yang Ye suddenly shouted with fury from afar, and the space there started to explode inch by inch!

Even though the aura Yang Ye emanated seemed like it could slash open the entire Four Dimensional Universe, his sword aura was actually weakening. Once he was stopped, his aura would be weakened, and the strength of his attacks would drop tremendously as well!

It didn’t take long for Yang Ye to arrive at the border of the Four Dimensional Universe.

He stopped again and retreated!

A short while later, he was back where he’d been a while ago!

Yang Ye stood there on the spot with a frown on his face!

It was a move that could only be used once, and it was practically one where if the user couldn’t kill the enemy, the user would die. However, after numerous tests, Yang Ye noticed many flaws in it!

Firstly, it was the acceleration portion of it. If he were fighting an expert, that expert would never let him increase his speed. Secondly, even if he could raise his speed in battle, the might of his attack would weaken due to him being obstructed!

It was like pulling on a spring. If one couldn’t pull it past its limits in one go, one would gradually lose strength, and the spring would return to its original form.

He needed to get it done in one go!

Besides that, he had to speed up his acceleration and strive to be at his limits right away!

Train!

Yang Ye took a deep breath, healed up, and then charged over again!

If he wanted to reach his limits, he had to train painstakingly! There was no shortcut to that!

Just like that, Yang Ye charged toward the border of the Four Dimensional Universe, over and over again. Every single time he was about to get there, he would retreat to the 9th layer of space.

It was an endless cycle!

…

While Yang Ye was training like a madman, a man suddenly arrived at an unknown world. The man was Heng Wangu!

Heng Wangu glanced at the surroundings. This world was on the verge of destruction, and while there was life on it, that was rapidly decreasing.

Heng Wangu fell silent for a long time, and then he closed his eyes slowly. At the same time, a golden statue appeared behind him!

A moment later, the golden statue slapped its huge palms against the ground, and then the ground quaked while an endless stream of Earth Energy converged to Heng Wangu!

As more and more Earth Energy surged into the golden statue, it gradually started to change. It grew brighter, more solid, and larger.

However, this world was being rapidly destroyed!

The ground beneath Heng Wangu had been full of life, but in just a short while, it had dried up like it had experienced years of drought!

Heng Wangu sensed the changes in the golden statue, and he spoke softly, “Everything is so insignificant before the Grand Dao!”
