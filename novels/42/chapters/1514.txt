Chapter 1515 - What A Weak Number One Genius!

Translator: InVader

The Martial Sect’s master had lost!

At this moment, everyone was stunned.

Who was the Martial Sect’s master? He was one of the strongest in the Western Territory! Not only the Western Territory, there were very few throughout the lower dimensions who could defeat him!

Yet now, he’d lost to a young man!

A wisp of bitterness arose on the corners of Cang Mu’s mouth. He’d guessed that Yang Ye may have comprehended sword intent. Because he could sense that his sword intent hadn’t vanished, and it had been absorbed instead. There was only one way to absorb his sword intent, and it was by possessing sword intent of a higher rank than his!

Quasi Returnal Rank sword intent!

Just as he expected, Yang Ye possessed Quasi Returnal Rank sword intent!

The Martial Sect’s master glanced at his hand. There was a mark there. A moment of silence ensued before he looked up at Yang Ye, “As expected of the number one genius in the lower dimensions. As far as I know, there isn’t a single person in the younger generation of our lower dimensions that can rival you. Not to mention the younger generation, there aren’t many in the older generation who can be a match for you!”

“You’re too kind!” Yang Ye grinned, “Senior, I’m here for An Nanjing. Can I meet her?”

The Martial Sect’s master remained silent for a moment and said, “Let’s talk inside!”

Yang Ye glanced at him and nodded, “Alright!”

The Martial Sect’s master nodded slightly, and then he glanced at the surroundings, “I didn’t show myself earlier because I wanted all of you to realize that there’s always someone stronger. Never think you’re strong because there are too many who are stronger than you. You can be confident, but you can’t be conceited and self-satisfied!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he turned around and entered the hall.

Yang Ye glanced at them and followed the Martial Sect’s master.

Many of them had quite complicated emotions on their faces as they watched Yang Ye leave, and their eyes were quite dim. If Yang Ye was a weakling, then many of them would still have a chance. However, Yang Ye was no weakling. The Martial Sect would definitely not be against An Nanjing being together with such a genius.

Nor would it dare to oppose it!

After all, if Yang Ye took An Nanjing away by force, then the Martial Sect wouldn’t just lose a genius, it would offend another one. Most importantly, the Martial Sect wouldn’t dare to do anything to him even if he took An Nanjing!

Simply speaking, Yang Ye was worthy of her, and they had no chance!

…

In the hall.

The Martial Sect’s master said, “She’s not here anymore.”

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly, “What do you mean?”

The Martial Sect’s master replied, “I’ve seen too many geniuses throughout my lifetime. However, I’ve only seen two geniuses who are geniuses amongst geniuses. One of them is you, and the other one is her. An Nanjing’s natural talent was too great, and she worked really hard. It didn’t take long after she arrived here for the Martial Sect to have nothing left to teach her.”

He paused for a moment and continued, “Actually, not too long ago, no one in my Martial Sect was capable of doing anything to her. Even I was completely suppressed in battle with her. If she used her true strength, then even I wouldn’t be a match for her.”

Yang Ye nodded. He wasn’t very surprised because An Nanjing’s natural talent was better than his. If the Primordial Pagoda was in An Nanjing’s possession, then An Nanjing might be even more extraordinary!

Meanwhile, the Martial Sect’s master added, “For the sake of not restricting her growth, we got a permit for her and sent her to the large world!”

The large world!

Yang Ye remained silent. He hadn’t expected that An Nanjing had gone to the large world. A short while passed before he asked, “When did she go?”

The Martial Sect’s master replied, “Half a month ago! She went looking for you, but she couldn’t find you.”

Half a month ago!

Yang Ye nodded. He was still in the Ominous Territory then, so she naturally couldn’t find him.

Meanwhile, the Martial Sect’s master added, “This place isn’t suitable for her growth anymore. It’s the same for you. The lower dimensions isn’t suitable for your growth.”

Yang Ye nodded, “I understand. No matter what, thank you for fostering and supporting her.”

“Don’t mention it!” The Martial Sect’s master smiled, “She’s a member of my Martial Sect!”

He hesitated for a moment and continued, “If I’m to be honest, you’re an extraordinary genius like her, and such geniuses can’t be bound by anything!”

Yang Ye nodded, “I understand what you mean. She has her own life, and I won’t restrict it. I didn’t plan to take her with me when I came here today. Of course, if the Martial Sect wasn’t treating her well, then I would definitely take her with me. But when I saw that the disciples of the Martial Sect were so fond of her, I knew she was in good hands.”

The Martial Sect’s master chuckled, “Are you jealous?”

“Jealous?” Yang Ye shook his head, “I’m absolutely happy. Being liked proves that she has charm, right?”

The martial Sect’s master smiled, “She may not be considered to be drop dead gorgeous, but that aura she possesses is unique. There’ll definitely be many who pursue her in the large world. At that time, you may be busy.”

Yang Ye smiled happily. Indeed, it was just as the Martial Sect’s master had said. Once he arrived at the large world, he would definitely have numerous love rivals to deal with! A girl like An Nanjing… No, actually, Su Qingshi, Zhuang Weiran, and the others were the same. If he didn’t possess formidable strength, then it would be impossible for him to be with them.

If he didn’t possess sufficient strength, it meant that he may die at any moment!

Meanwhile, the Martial Sect’s master suddenly asked, “When are you going to the large world?”

Yang Ye replied, “Very soon.”

The Martial Sect’s master asked, “How do you intend to go up there?”

Yang Ye smiled, “If they let me, then I’ll go up nicely; if they refuse, then I’ll kill my way there.”

Kill?! The Martial Sect’s master’s eyes narrowed slightly. He gazed at Yang Ye for a long time before he laughed bitterly, “In the entire lower dimensions, I’m afraid you’re the only one who dares to say something like that.”

The large world!

Kill his way into the large world!

It represented that Yang Ye was going to challenge the laws and order of the large world. In the last tens of thousands of years, only two people in the lower dimensions had done so. One of them was Jian Wuji, and the other was the Unfettered One. So, it was obvious how difficult it was to challenge the laws of the large world. Yet now, Yang Ye intended to kill his way there! That wasn’t just simply challenging the laws and order of the large world, it was equivalent to declaring war against the laws and order of the large world!

Would he succeed?

The Martial Sect’s master looked forward to that quite a bit.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye said, “Since An Nanjing has gone to the large world, then I won’t disturb you further. Farewell!”

The Martial Sect’s master nodded, “Farewell!”

Yang Ye nodded, and then he turned around and walked off. He encountered some disciples of the Martial Sect when he left the hall. At this moment, all of them had no hostility left in their eyes, and only respect could be seen in their eyes.

Yang Ye nodded slightly to them and was about to leave. However, a ray of light suddenly descended from the sky, and it descended to the center of the square in the distance.

Everyone gazed at that ray of light. Even Yang Ye stopped and looked at it.

The light dispersed to reveal a young man in a black robe.

A wisp of surprise flashed through Yang Ye’s eyes because the young man was a Deity!

A Deity!

The young man was probably not more than 30 years old, but he’d attained the Deity Realm at such an age. Needless to say, his natural talent was very terrifying. However, the young man’s aura wasn’t really stable, or it should be said to be very unstable. If he was compared to the Martial Sect’s master, then it was like the gap between the heavens and the earth!

The young man didn’t rely solely on himself to attain his current cultivation!

This was what Yang Ye thought right now!

Yang Ye ignored the young man and intended to leave. However, the young man suddenly said, “Where’s An Nanjing? Tell her to come here! I’m going to teach her a fucking lesson today!”

Yang Ye stopped when he heard this, and then he turned to look at the young man.

“Yun Kun!” Meanwhile, one of the disciples by Yang Ye’s side said, “He’s an extraordinary genius from Wolfsky Stellar Region. He came to challenge our Martial Sect in the past, but he was defeated by Senior Sister An. He wasn’t able to let it go, and he even said that he would come and get his revenge in the future. I never expected him to really come here. Moreover, he’s a Deity now!”

As soon as he finished speaking, that disciple had a solemn expression on his face.

That disciple wasn’t the only one who reacted like that, many other disciples of the Martial Sect revealed extremely solemn expressions on their faces as well.

A Deity!

The Deity Realm wasn’t just a little bit stronger than the Semi-Deity Realm. Even though they were very confident in An Nanjing, Yun Kun was still a Deity! 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Meanwhile, Yun Kun glanced at the surroundings and laughed coldly, “What? She doesn’t dare to show herself?”

A wisp of surprise flashed through Yang Ye’s eyes. He’d noticed something, and it was that they didn’t know An Nanjing wasn’t here anymore. It didn’t take long for him to realize that the Martial Sect had kept it a secret. It made sense because An Nanjing was one of the Martial Sect’s trump cards. So, it was a form of deterrence if others thought she was still here!

“What? Where’s An Nanjing?” Meanwhile, Yun Kun had a fierce smile on his face, “Tell her to get the fuck out here! The number one genius of the Martial Sect? The number one genius of the Western Territory? I’m going to make all of you realize that I, Yun Kun, am the number one genius of the Western Territory, and she’s nothing before me! She…”

Suddenly, Yang Ye appeared in front of him.

Yun Kun was slightly stunned, and then he was about to speak. However, Yang Ye suddenly drew his sword and swung it.

A ray of sword energy shot forward!

Two overlapped Heavenrends!

Yun Kun’s expression changed drastically, and he hurriedly waved his hands about. Around 100 energy fists flashed forward and formed a dense wave that slammed against Yang Ye’s sword energy.

However, his energy fists were like paper that Yang Ye’s sword energy sliced through with ease!

Bang!

Yun Kun was blasted far away. In the end, his figure slammed against the ground and blasted open a huge hole there.

In the hole, Yun Kun laid flat on the ground while his body twitched. Besides that, blood was flowing out like a torrent from the corner of his mouth.

Yang Ye walked over to Yun Kun, gazed at him, and said, “The number one genius of the Western Territory? How weak!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye’s figure transformed into a ray of light that vanished into the sky!
