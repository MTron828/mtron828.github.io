Chapter 1506 - 10 Deities? That Just Takes 10 Attacks!

Translator: InVader

At this moment, the expressions of everyone here had changed.

A Deity had been killed in an instant!

Yang Ye had actually killed a Deity in an instant!

The black robed old man was a Deity! But a Deity had actually been instantly annihilated by a Semi-Deity! At this moment, a trace of fear and panic had arisen in all their hearts.

Even Ma Wudi was stunned. He hadn’t expected Yang Ye to actually kill a Deity in an instant!

Even though he could defeat Deities too, he was absolutely incapable of killing a Deity in an instant. But Yang Ye had succeeded.

Obviously, he wasn’t on the same level as Yang Ye!

Ma Wudi wasn’t the only one. Li Canghai had an extremely solemn expression on his face as well. He knew that Yang Ye was very strong and was a monstrous genius because he’d gathered information on Yang Ye. However, all that information was mistaken. Because the information said that Yang Ye wasn’t this terrifying. When Yang Ye fought the Celestial Demon Lord that day, he’d utilized demon beasts and other treasures.

Yet now, Yang Ye hadn’t used anything but his sword, yet he’d instantly annihilated a Deity!

Li Cangming knew that he’d severely underestimated Yang Ye’s strength!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly patted the Emperor Python, “Kill! Kill to your heart’s content!”

Roar!

The Emperor Python roared with fury, and then its tail swept towards Li Cangming and the others.

The space in the surroundings instantly collapsed before it, and everyone here was surrounded by a huge black hole. Big Blackie and Little Blackie didn’t stand by idly, and they charged at Li Cangming’s group as well.

Meanwhile, around a dozen terrifying auras shot up into the sky from down below. It didn’t take long for 14 more old men to appear in the sky.

Deities!

All of them were Deities!

At this moment, Nether Emperor Stellar Region had 30 Deities if Li Cangming was included!

30 Deities!

In next to no time, five Deities surrounded the Emperor Python. While it was five against one, the Emperor Python wasn’t at a disadvantage at all, and it even firmly suppressed them. However, because it was fighting the joint forces of five Deities, it couldn’t kill them in a short amount of time. As for Big Blackie and Little Blackie, they were surrounded by 15 Deities.

Because of the number of enemies they faced, they were at a disadvantage. However, their defenses were too strong, so those Deities couldn’t do anything to them as well.

At this moment, Yang Ye was surrounded as well. If Li Cangming was included, he was surrounded by a total of 10 Deities!

10 Deities!

Meanwhile, Ma Wudi laughed coldly, “Yang Ye, aren’t you really strong? Why don’t you display that strength right now?”

Yang Ye gazed at Ma Wudi, and it caused Ma Wudi’s expression to change slightly. He instinctively moved in Li Cangming’s direction. After he saw Yang Ye kill a Deity in an instant just now, he’d already gone over to Li Cangming’s side. Obviously, he was afraid that Yang Ye would kill him too. Because he couldn’t stop that attack!

“A genius from the large world?” Yang Ye shook his head, “That?”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye glanced at the 10 Deities around him, “10 Deities? That just takes 10 swings of my sword!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he drew his sword and swung it.

Om!

A sword howl resounded, and then the head of a Deity flew up into the air while accompanied by a torrent of blood.

A wisp of ghastly killing intent flashed through Li Cangming’s eyes, “Kill him!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he shot towards Yang Ye, and the other eight people followed closely behind him!

Ma Wudi intended to join the battle as well. However, his eyes suddenly opened wide, and they were filled with disbelief, “How… how could that be possible?!”

A strange scene was playing out on the battlefield!

Li Cangming and the others were besieging Yang Ye, but Yang Ye didn’t flee or seem to be suppressed like Ma Wudi had expected. Conversely, in just a few breaths of time, Yang Ye had killed two more Deities! Moreover, Yang Ye was completely unharmed!

At this moment, Yang Ye didn’t try to defend himself at all, and he just allowed his enemies’ attacks to strike him. Even though they attacked like madmen, Yang Ye had forcefully endured all those attacks. It made sense because Yang Ye’s body was at the Undying Realm. Coupled with the Undying Elemental Body technique, his body was even more terrifying than the Emperor Python!

Not to mention the attacks of Deities, he could even forcefully resist the attacks of Dualism Realm experts!

So, even if Li Cangming had a large group fighting against Yang Ye, they weren’t able to gain an advantage over him and even lost two of their companions to him!

At this moment, Li Cangming and the others were absolutely shocked. Because Yang Ye’s physical defenses were too terrifying! Even though their attacks affected Yang Ye, Yang Ye was completely fine, and he was merely pushed back or turned slightly pale at most. Besides that, he didn’t seem to be affected at all, and he didn’t even lose a single drop of blood!

However, Yang Ye’s attacks were absolutely capable of taking their lives with just a single hit!

The longer they fought, the more shocked they were, and the more horrified they felt!

However, Yang Ye seemed like he’d gone mad, and he grew stronger and more insane as the battle progressed. A while later, two more Deities lost their heads.

At this moment, Li Cangming’s side was down to six Deities!

“Stop!” Suddenly, Li Cangming’s voice resounded.

As soon as he finished speaking, all six of them flashed around 3km back and created some distance from Yang Ye.

Li Cangming spoke in a low voice, “Yang Ye! What do you want?!” At this moment, there wasn’t just a solemn expression in his eyes, there was fear in them as well!

He wasn’t the only one. Everyone here showed fear in their eyes!

Yang Ye’s strength was too terrifying!

At this moment, Li Cangming felt quite regretful. He regretted getting mixed up in all of this. If he knew Yang Ye was so terrifying, he would have absolutely not participated in all of this. Actually, he hadn’t expected it to play out like this. Besides Ma Wudi, there was another reason why the situation had developed to such an extent!

It was that violet robed young man he’s sent with Ma Wudi. If that young man knew how to act according to the situation, then Nether Emperor Stellar Region wouldn't have entered into direct confrontation with Yang Ye!

But… it was all too late now!

“What do I want?” A cold smile curled up on the corners of Yang Ye’s mouth, “Your stellar region sent its forces to bully my wife, yet you ask me what I want? I want to kill all of you!”

As he spoke, he drew his sword and swung it swiftly again!

A ray of sword energy shot forward!

Li Cangming and the others’ expressions changed, and they hurriedly attacked in unison.

This time, Yang Ye’s sword energy wasn’t able to kill a Deity. Li Cangming and the others were no fools. So, how could they possibly give Yang Ye another chance to kill one of them? So long as Yang Ye attacked, all of them would immediately join forces. After all, while it was impossible for them to resist Yang Ye’s attacks on their own, what about their joint forces?

Yang Ye wasn’t strong enough to kill five Deities with a single swing of his sword!

“Yang Ye, my Nether Emperor Stellar Region is at fault!” Meanwhile, Li Cangming spoke in a low voice, “But all of them have perished. Will you still not let the matter rest?”

Yang Ye chuckled, “What? You want to seek reconciliation now?”

Li Cangming spoke in a low voice, “Continuing this battle isn’t beneficial for your Clouds of Heaven Stellar Region or my stellar region!”

He was naturally unwilling to continue. Because if it continued, all of them might be killed in battle.

Yang Ye replied, “You want to make peace? Alright! Come! Cut off that fellow’s head and give it to me, and then compensate me with five million divine crystals. I can consider sparing all of you if you can satisfy those conditions!”

Li Cangming’s face instantly became gloomy, “You’re going too far!”

“I’m going too far?”

A vicious expression curled up on the corners of Yang Ye’s mouth, “Did you think about how you were going too far when you sent your forces to bully my wife in Clouds of Heaven Stellar Region? Allow me to show you what going too far is like!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he transformed into a ray of light that shot towards Li Cangming and the others.

Li Cangming was visibly furious when he saw Yang Ye attack again, and he waved his right hand, “Activate the formation!”

As soon as he gave the order, a black robed old man shot into the city. An instant later, countless beams of light shot up into the air from the city, and it didn’t take long for them to arrive in the sky and form a huge cloud.

Once the cloud was formed, a huge beam of light that was around 300m wide shot out from the cloud and descended in Yang Ye’s direction!

At the same time, Li Cangming and the others retreated. They chose to avoid Yang Ye because they didn’t dare go against Yang Ye’s attacks!

After all, they couldn’t withstand Yang Ye’s attacks!

Yang Ye looked up at the beam of light. At this moment, he felt like something had locked onto him, and that something was coming from the huge cloud in the sky above.

Yang Ye drew his sword and swung it. A beam of sword energy shot up into the sky and slammed against the beam of light.

Boom!

The sword energy and the beam of light rumbled and shattered into pieces.

But in just an instant, another beam of light emerged from the cloud and shot towards Yang Ye!

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly. It seems like the Eye of the Heaven Dao!

Meanwhile, Li Cangming spoke abruptly, “Yang Ye, the Eye of the Heaven Dao was used as the basis to create this formation. As long as the formation is intact and spirit energy is sufficient, then it can attack incessantly. You can resist it once, twice, and even three times. But can you resist it a hundred times or a thousand times?”

Yang Ye glanced at Li Cangming, and then he drew his sword and swung it!

Three overlapped Heavenrends!

As soon as the sword energy left Yang Ye’s sword, the space in a vast area around him instantly cracked apart, and then everyone watched with astonishment as the sword energy shot up into the sky. The beam of light before it was instantly blasted into bits, and the sword energy didn’t slow down at all as it slammed against the huge cloud.

Boom! Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

The huge cloud exploded into pieces!

Everyone here was stunned.

It’s gone just like that?

Yang Ye sheathed his sword, glanced at Li Cangming’s group, and said, “It only took a single swing of my sword!”

“Haha!!” Suddenly, Ma Wudi started roaring with laughter, and everyone looked at him.

Yang Ye gazed at Ma Wudi as well.

Ma Wudi had a wide grin that was full of ridicule as he said, “Yang Ye, you’re still trying to put on a show of strength when death has arrived?”

Everyone was puzzled by this.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye looked up at the sky.

The space there trembled, and then an old man walked out from that expanse of space.

A Deity!

All of them had solemn expressions on their faces. Because while the old man was a Deity, his aura felt deep like an ocean, and it felt simply unfathomable!

Obviously, the old man was a Dualism Realm expert who had been suppressed to the Deity Realm!

Meanwhile, Ma Wudi started walking towards Yang Ye, “Yang Ye, I have over 100 ways to kill you. Tell me how you want to die! Right, I heard you have quite a few wives. It’s fine. I’ll help you take care of them. Of course, I’ll take care of them in bed. Hahaha!”

Suddenly, Yang Ye drew his sword with his eyes closed. A moment later, his sword vanished.

The Rebirth Sword!

“AH!!” As soon as the sword vanished, a shrill cry resounded from the sky.

Everyone looked up, and they saw the old man’s body explode.

A ray of light flashed, and then the sword returned to Yang Ye’s grasp.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye gazed at Ma Wudi who’d walked over to him, “Tell me how you want to die.”
