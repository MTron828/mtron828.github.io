Chapter 2536 – Cut Them!

The black robed man led Yang Ye away from the street and arrived at a small house by the street.

The house was only dimly lit and quite dark.

There was just one wooden chair in the room.

The black robed man spoke softly, “Please wait a moment!”

He withdrew a talisman and crushed it.

Around 10 minutes later, a figure appeared on the chair before Yang Ye.

That figure sat on the chair while covered beneath the darkness, so the figure’s appearance was impossible to discern.

Once the figure appeared, the black robed man by Yang Ye’s side immediately left.

A short while passed before the person said, “You even have Chaotic Fruits! I’m really surprised!”

The person’s voice was quite hoarse. Obviously, it had been changed.

Yang Ye smiled, “I’ll just be frank. How much do you know about the Ancient Sword Sect and Soul Sect?”

The figure replied, “Everything!”

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly, “Really?”

The figure nodded, “Our network of information is the greatest throughout Eternal Kingdom. It isn’t just the Eternal Kingdom, we know about the desolate race and Eternal Border too. Of course, we know about you as well!”

Yang Ye smiled, “It’s amazing you’re still alive when you know so much!”

The voice replied, “You’re amazing too!”Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Yang Ye asked, “What do you mean?”

The figure said, “Because you’re linked to existences that even we do not know about.”

Yang Ye gazed at the figure for a long time and said, “Can you tell me about it?”

The figure shook its head, “It’s meaningless. Two Chaotic Fruits are very precious, but to be honest, I don’t really want to interfere in the business between the Ancient Sword Sect and Soul Sect.”

Yang Ye asked, “Why?”

The figure replied, “Because the Soul Sect is very good at doing things. Their current master is much smarter than their Sect Master from all those years ago. Allow me to be honest, there are things that all the other powers tacitly approve of, and it’s even to the extent that some people in your Ancient Sword Sect itself are happy to see it happen. You can’t change anything. All you can do is leave the sect, and it’s best to leave as soon as possible. You can’t save this dumpster fire.”

Yang Ye closed his eyes slowly, “I want to know who’s the mole in the Ancient Sword Sect, and I want some information on the Soul Sect!”

The figure shook its head, “I have some information on that, but I can’t give it to you.”

Yang Ye smiled, “Even you are afraid of them?”

The figure replied, “It isn’t fear, it’s just that we do not wish to get involved in it. Or I should say, it isn’t worth it.”

The figure stood up at this point, “I’ll give you a free piece of information. Your identity isn’t a secret to some people. Leave Eternal Kingdom now and you may be in time.”

Yang Ye smiled, “Is someone targeting me?”

The figure replied, “What do you think? To be honest, the previous master of the Ancient Sword Sect chose you as the next sect master just to use you.”

Yang Ye was quite puzzled, “Use me?”

The figure replied, “He knew his lifespan was exhausted, and so the Ancient Sword Sect would fall into chaos once he was gone. Besides your potential and talent, he chose you because of one other reason, it’s because you’re an uncertain variable. You’re an uncertain existence. Anything can happen when you are involved. It may be good, bad, nice, or evil. Anything is possible! He wanted to give the sect one last chance!”

Yang Ye didn’t say anything. He thought for a moment and flipped his palm. There was a Worldborn Fruit there.

A Worldborn Fruit!

Yang Ye gazed at the figure in silence.

A long time passed before the figure suddenly smiled, “You’ve really, really surprised me. Such a treasure was rare even in the ancient times!”

Yang Ye said, “I’m sure you know what I want!”

The figure replied, “Do you really plan to get yourself involved in this?”

Yang Ye smiled, “Since I’ve agreed to be the sect master, I naturally must do it well.”

The figure nodded and flicked a scroll over to Yang Ye, “A fair trade. A Worldborn Fruit is worth the request you’ve made. This is what we know.”

Yang Ye put the scroll away and flicked the fruit over to the figure.

Yang Ye turned around with the intent to leave, but the figure suddenly said, “The Sprite Progenitor isn’t with you, right?”

Yang Ye smiled, “Go figure!”

The figure said, “We have no intent to take it for ourselves.”

Yang Ye didn’t say anything and left the house.

The figure in the house spoke softly, “Why get yourself involved in this…?”

…

Yang Ye left the underground trade area and unfurled the scroll. He had indifference all over his face as he read it.

A long time passed before he sighed softly and left the War Dimension.

Once he left the War Dimension, Yang Ye rushed back to the Ancient Sword Sect.

Yang Ye went to the Sword Cave once he arrived, and the old man was still lying there.

According to others, the old man had been an elder in the past, and he’d made some mistakes which ultimately led him to being punished to guarding the Sword Cave.

Yang Ye went over to the old man. Meanwhile, the old man opened his eyes but didn’t stand up and bow to Yang Ye.

Yang Ye smiled, “You’re Gu Han, the 9th Sect Master of the Ancient Sword Sect. You grew depressed from the death of your beloved, and so you left your position as sect master and lived in seclusion here to protect her.”

The old man’s eyes narrowed slightly while a wisp of icy coldness arose within them.

Yang Ye sat by the old man’s side. The old man’s identity wasn’t information he’d obtained from his previous trade, it was Sword Scroll who’d told him about the old man. Sword Scroll had been in the sect for far too long, so she knew its history even better than anyone in the sect.

Since the ancient times until the day that she left the Ancient Sword Sect, she’d been protecting the sect as a third party. Of course, she was watching it too.

She knew everything here very well.

The old man suddenly asked, “She chose you, right?”

Yang Ye nodded.

The old man sighed, “It’s the Ancient Sword Sect that wronged her. Gu Feng lost his way.”

Gu Feng was the previous sect master!

Yang Ye asked, “Do you know about the situation that the sect is in right now?”

Gu Han shook his head, “I don’t care about all of that.”

Yang Ye said, “Me too!”

Gu Han said, “Then why are you still here acting as the sect master? To be honest, you’re in a horrible position. You don’t hold true authority nor have you gained the acknowledgement of the various powers throughout Eternal Kingdom! You’re just someone they pushed forward to get through this period! You don’t mind me being frank, right?”

Yang Ye smiled, “I don’t. I don’t mind at all. Because it’s all true.”

Gu Han nodded, “Then why haven’t you left? You’re quite a capable person, and you’ll have a pretty good future if you leave.”

Yang Ye smiled, “Do you know what responsibility is?”

Gu Han gazed at Yang Ye.

Yang Ye smiled, “I’m not like you. I try my best to fulfill my responsibilities! Since I promised her that I’ll be the sect master, then I’ll work hard toward that end. As for whether I get dragged down from my position in the future or I’m forced to flee for my life, it’s all something for the future. I’ll work hard to do well until that happens!”

Gu Han glanced at Yang Ye, “You plan to suffer here just because of your promise to her?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “If I knew about all the issues here in advance, I would have never accepted any of this. But it can’t be helped, I’ve been swept into all of this now. I really can’t bring myself to flee before a battle.”

Actually, he wanted to leave and ignore everything here too.

However, he suddenly realized that the benefits of truly taking control of the Ancient Sword Sect were great too.

Of course, the true reason was that this whole thing was too aggrieving!

It was his first day as sect master, and it was even for such a huge sect. But someone was trying to drag him into the dirt. It was a terrible insult and disrespect to him! So, wouldn’t it be an absolute humiliation if he just shrunk back now?

The Sect Master!

He wasn’t one to accept the position when they wanted him to, then leave when they asked it of him!

Since he was the sect master, he planned to truly be the sect master!

Meanwhile, Gu Han suddenly said, “I can’t help you!”

Yang Ye smiled, “Do you know what will happen to the sect in the future? It will vanish from the West Region, and countless disciples will die. Even if they survive, they will be without a home. The West Region is the only part of Eternal Kingdom that focuses on the Sword Dao, so they will be without any support.”

He pointed at the Sword Cave, “All of this, the souls of all the sect’s ancestors will vanish. This place will be trampled upon, and the souls of countless disciples will be extracted.”

Gu Han remained expressionless!

Yang Ye smiled and stood up, “I heard that woman you liked didn’t feel the same way!”

Bang!

A wave of powerful sword intent slammed against Yang Ye.

Yang Ye was pushed over 300m back!

Yang Ye glanced at the cracks on his chest and looked up at the old man who was emanating ghastly killing intent, “I don’t like judging others, but now, as the current sect master of the Ancient Sword Sect, I’m going to judge you, the former sect master of the Ancient Sword Sect. You’re a coward. You couldn’t face it then, and even after so many years, you still can’t face it now. You’ve been constantly avoiding it all.”

Yang Ye walked into the Sword Cave once he finished speaking.

The old man fell silent.

In the Sword Cave, Yang Ye went to Gu Nan.

As soon as he saw Yang Ye, Gu Nan asked, “What do you know?”

Yang Ye smiled, “I know a little about everything I should know.”

Gu Nan asked, “Then why haven’t you left?”

Yang Ye spoke solemnly, “All of you have given up, right?”

Gu Nan replied indifferently, “What else can we do? The sect doesn’t have an extraordinary expert to deter them, and so we will become meat to be divided up by others. It isn’t just our Ancient Sword Sect, even the Di Clan and others before it suffered the same fate.”

Yang Ye gazed at Gu Nan for a long time, and then he turned around and walked away.

Yang Ye suddenly stopped when he arrived at the exit, “Reality is very cruel, but my sword will never submit to it!”

Gu Nan suddenly said, “They are much stronger and greater in number than you’ve ever imagined!”

Yang Ye replied with a question, “So?”

Gu Nan gazed at Yang Ye in silence.

Yang Ye said, “You’re already giving up before you even try to fight. All of you are such embarrassments!”

Gu Nan sighed softly, “We’re no match for them!”

Yang Ye suddenly turned around and spoke angrily, “If someone slaps you on the right cheek, you will show him the left because you’re no match for him, right?”

Yang Ye’s voice grew louder as he spoke, “We are sword cultivators! We hold the sword, not mud! What’s the point of cultivating the sword? To chop wood? No, it’s too kill! If someone tries to act against them, we chop them! If we can’t cut them down, that’s fine too. But if we don’t even have the courage to swing our swords, then what’s the point of even holding them? You should just head home and do some embroidery with a needle!”

Yang Ye turned around once he finished speaking and was about to walk away.

Suddenly, the entire Sword Cave shook, and then sword howls resounded incessantly. A moment later, numerous souls appeared within the Sword Cave!
