Chapter 1453 – Qiong Qi’s Home!

“What nonsense!” Suddenly, a furious howl resounded from Yang Ye’s chest, and then a ray of black light flashed before Qiong Qi appeared in front of Yang Ye.

As soon as they saw Qiong Qi, fear had instantly appeared in the Celestial Demon Wolves’ eyes. They were extremely afraid of Qiong Qi. After all, not only had they failed to injure Qiong Qi when they fought him together, they were even dragged into the Primordial Pagoda.

It wasn’t just the demon wolves that displayed fear towards Qiong Qi, even Eaglet’s eyes had fear in them.

Qiong Qi felt extremely dangerous to it!

Eaglet glanced at Yang Ye. At this moment, it felt that Yang Ye seemed even more mysterious.

A smile curled up on the corners of Yang Ye’s mouth when he saw Qiong Qi show himself. Meanwhile, Qiong Qi suddenly said, “What the fuck are you smiling for? Kid, in the past, I felt that no matter what sort of trap you led me into, it wouldn’t be able to kill within the three years I agreed to help you. But now it seems like it won’t take three years for you to kill me!”

Qiong Qi felt quite aggrieved.

Since he stayed by Yang Ye’s side, he’d been constantly facing more and more trouble. Moreover, every single one was something that even he wasn’t really able to endure. After all, he hadn’t recovered completely.

Yang Ye smiled with embarrassment, “I had no other choice....”

Qiong Qi glared fiercely at him, “If you don’t have the ability, then don’t cause so much trouble. Kid, to be honest, you’re the most tenacious person I’ve met. You’re so good at causing trouble, yet you’re still alive. If we were in Milky Way Stellar Region, I would definitely think that you’re sworn brothers with Yan Jun.”

Yang Ye laughed bitterly, “Brother Qiong Qi, you really can’t blame me for this. Just think about it, I’ve been absolutely careful since I arrived at this place, and I definitely kept a low profile if I could. However, these fellows think they can bully me because they’ve lived longer. Tell me, I just wanted to pass through, but these fellows absolutely refuse to let me, and they keep trying to kill me. They are bullying me for being young!”

“Pass through?” Qiong QI shook his head, “You don’t understand the nature of demon beasts. They care a great deal about their territory. Any person or demon beast that enters their territory will be treated as a form of offence.”

He glanced at Yang Ye and continued, “You’re here for the Spring of Life?”

Yang Ye nodded.

Qiong Qi fell silent, and there was a slightly solemn expression on his face.

Yang Ye’s face became solemn as well when he saw Qiong Qi react in this way. He knew Qiong Qi’s character well. Qiong Qi was even more unruly than he was. Since he’d known Qiong Qi, only the Primordial Pagoda had aroused extreme fear in Qiong Qi. Besides that, even Jian Wuji was just not bad to Qiong Qi!

Of course, he knew that Qiong Qi wasn’t being haughty. He knew nothing about Qiong Qi’s origins, but he knew that Qiong Qi was extraordinarily terrifying.

Yet now, Qiong Qi’s face had become solemn.

Even Qiong Qi senses danger here?

Yang Ye asked, “Even you think this place is dangerous?”

Qiong Qi remained silent for a short while before he said, “Actually, you shouldn’t have come here right now. It isn’t a place that you can be in right now. Even I feel this place is very dangerous in my current state!”

It’s very dangerous for him! Yang Ye’s heart shook, Even Qiong Qi feels it’s extremely dangerous....

Meanwhile, Qiong Qi added, “Actually, it isn’t a bad thing for you. At the very least, it’ll help you understand that your current strength is still very weak. Otherwise, you might become so confident that you lose yourself in it.”

Yang Ye smiled bitterly. Needless to say, even though he’d known that there were definitely other experts in this world who were stronger than him. However, he felt that there probably was nothing in the lower dimensions that could pose a threat to him. Especially when he had the Celestial Demon Wolves, he was really confident, and he felt that he could go anywhere in the lower dimensions.

However, once he arrived at the Ominous Territory, he noticed that Quasi Returnal Rank sword intent, Quasi Returnal Rank slaughter intent, a sword that surpasses the known ranks of quality, and Heavenrend.... There really wasn’t anything great about all of them.

Meanwhile, Qiong Qi added, “If it weren’t for your lifespan, I would make you leave right now. However, making your leave right now is equivalent to making you die. So, continue forward.”

Yang Ye said, “But even you feel that this place is dangerous....”

Qiong Qi replied, “Forget that for now. Let me deal with that fellow within the cave.”

Yang Ye warned, “It’s very strong!”

Qiong Qi shook his head, “I’ve passed through countless rivers of stars and innumerable worlds. I’ve really not met any demon beast that can pose a threat to me.”

Yang Ye said, “Then aren’t you matchless amongst demon beasts?”

“I wish!” Qiong Qi rolled his eyes, “Having not met any doesn’t mean that there are none. Moreover, there are at least four types of demon beasts in my old home that could pose a threat to me. Even I would have no choice but to flee before them.”

“Which four?” Yang Ye was quite curious. He was really curious about demon beasts that could pose a threat to Qiong Qi and force him to flee.

Qiong Qi glanced at Yang Ye and replied, “The Primal Dragon and Primal Phoenix. Fortunately, only those two fellows can be considered as being a primal dragon and a primal phoenix.”

Yang Ye asked, “The Primal Dragon and Primal Phoenix? Are they very strong?”

Qiong Qi replied, “Let me explain it like this. If they are willing to give you a drop of their Blood Essence, then your body will immediately become a few dozen times stronger than that Celestial Demon Hegemon Body!” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

Qiong Qi added, “Besides them, there’s another fellow that’s very terrifying. That fellow is one that even the Primal Dragon and Primal Phoenix wouldn’t rashly offend.”

Yang Ye hurriedly asked, “What is he?”

Big Blackie and Little Blackie gazed at Qiong Qi as well. They too were very curious about what demon beast it was that even filled Qiong Qi with extreme fear.

Qiong Qi’s expression became serious as he spoke, “The Torch Dragon!”

“The Torch Dragon?” Yang Ye shook his head to display that he’d never heard of it.

Qiong Qi nodded, “Even though it’s a dragon just like the Primal Dragon, it’s not from the same line. That fellow is quite crazy. When he opens his eyes, light fills the world, and daytime arrives; when he closes his eyes, darkness descends, and night covers the world. However, that fellow was too arrogant and kept causing trouble, just like you. In the end, his punishment was to guard a place. His life isn’t great at that place!”

Yang Ye’s face darkened, What do you mean like me? I’ve been keeping a really low profile!

“Don’t look at me like that!” Qiong Qi gazed at Yang Ye and continued, “Your ability to cause trouble isn’t inferior to his. You have to work on your temper and take warning from his fate. Actually, I think that both of you really suit each other. If both of you are together, then your ability to cause trouble.... Tsk tsk....”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

Meanwhile, Qiong Qi added, “The last one can’t really be considered a demon. It should be considered half human and half demon. Her strength isn’t even the main point, the main point is her network of relationships. If you offend her, then you’ll die before you even know what hit you. Even the Torch Dragon has to be absolutely careful before her. It can’t be helped because she has too many people who are willing to help her.”

When he spoke up to this point, Qiong Qi suddenly stretched out a claw and patted Yang Ye on the shoulder, “Kid, the reason I told you all of that is because I wanted to tell you something. Don’t think you can act recklessly just because you have me by your side. Not to mention the humans, even if we just talk about demon beasts, then besides those four I mentioned, there are many other formidable demon beasts in this world. Even though I don’t fear them, they don’t fear me either. If we really enter into battle, then I would only have a 50% chance of winning against many demon beasts, and my chances of winning might even be lower. Understand?”

Yang Ye nodded, “I understand.”

He really had gained understanding. Qiong Qi had said all of that for a single reason, and it was to make him understand that he couldn’t think that he can act recklessly just because Qiong Qi was by his side. Indeed, besides his own courage, there was another reason why he’d dared to travel deep into the Ominous Territory, and it was Qiong Qi’s presence!

But what if he encountered danger that even Qiong Qi couldn’t resolve. What would he do then?

In the end, he couldn’t rely on Qiong Qi too much. Or it should be said that he shouldn’t rely too much on external sources of strength.

Only his own strength was true strength!

“It’s good that you understand!” Qiong Qi nodded slightly, “You have great karmic luck, so your future accomplishments will definitely be extraordinary. Of course, the precondition is that you don’t die!”

Yang Ye smiled. He seemed to have thought of something and asked, “What do you think would happen if we drag that Primal Dragon, Primal Phoenix, and that Torch Dragon into the pagoda...?”

“Do you want to die?” Qiong Qi interrupted Yang Ye and spoke angrily, “Can you stop thinking about things like that? Drag them into the pagoda? You really have a good imagination!”

Yang Ye asked, “Are they stronger than the Primordial Pagoda?”

Qiong Qi was stunned. He thought for a moment, and then he shook his head, “They aren’t! However, who will drag them in there? Will you? In any case, I won’t.”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

“Alright, cut the crap. I have other things to do once I deal with that fellow.” As soon as he finished speaking, Qiong Qi turned around and walked towards the cave.

Yang Ye quickly asked, “Do you need help?”

Qiong Qi didn’t say anything, and he’d already entered the cave.

Bang! Bang! Bang!

Explosions resounded incessantly within the cave, and it didn’t take long for howls of pain to come from within the cave.

Yang Ye heaved a sigh of relief when he heard those howls.

Because those howls didn’t belong to Qiong Qi.

Qiong Qi’s strength has grown again! Yang Ye had noticed that every single time Qiong Qi showed himself, Qiong Qi’s strength was much stronger than it had been. Just like this very moment, Qiong Qi’s strength was much stronger than it had been during the battle with the Celestial Demon Lord.

But it made sense. After all, Qiong Qi had eaten a demonic dragon alive. At the same time that he was digesting that dragon, his strength was recovering swiftly.

In short, Qiong Qi’s recovery was extremely beneficial to him. Even though he couldn’t rely on Qiong Qi too much, it depended on the situation. If he didn’t rely on Qiong Qi in this place, then who would he rely on?

It would be a waste not to utilize such help!

However, he had to discard those immature thoughts he’d had about being invincible while he had Qiong Qi by his side.

Time trickled by. The ground was constantly trembling. Actually, it wasn’t just the ground, even Monkey Mountain seemed to be vibrating. The explosions within the cave were still continuing incessantly, but it didn’t take long for the explosions to grow softer, and only the howls of pain remained.

Around 15 minutes later, Qiong Qi swaggered out of the cave. He walked over to Yang Ye and said, “You can go collect the corpse now.”

Yang Ye felt speechless.
