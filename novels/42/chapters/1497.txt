Chapter 1498 - Do You Want To Die?

Translator: InVader

Yang Ye turned to look, and he saw an old man walking slowly in their direction.

The old man was extremely old, and his brows were already snow white while wrinkles covered his face. It seemed like he’d experienced the passage of many centuries. Coupled with his hunched back, it made the old man seem extremely old.

Lian Banzhuang and the others had extremely solemn expressions on their faces when they saw the old man, and there was even a trace of fear in their eyes.

Yang Ye had quite a solemn expression on his face because the old man felt unfathomable to him! DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Similarly, Yu Qing and the old man by his side had extremely solemn expressions on their faces. Obviously, the old man felt dangerous to them.

Yang Ye asked Lian Banzhuang, “Who is that?”

Lian Banzhuang spoke solemnly, “A very strong and mysterious person, but also a person who keeps a very low profile. He was the number one expert here, but he fell into a deep slumber. So, that demon beast which Blood Maiden killed took his place. We don’t know how strong he is, and only the Unfettered One does.”

She gazed at Yang Ye and continued, “Do you know what the Unfettered One said after fighting him?”

Yang Ye asked curiously, “What?”

“Very good!” Lian Banzhuang said, “He said very good. Moreover, he said that if that old man can overcome his own limits, then he would be willing to fight the old man again!”

Very good! Yang Ye had a solemn expression on his face. After all, it wasn’t easy to make the Unfettered One say someone was not bad!

Yang Ye gazed at the old man. It didn’t take long for the old man to arrive here. The old man glanced at Yu Ming and said, “I haven’t encountered many experts upon arriving at this universe of yours, but the experts I’ve encountered in this universe aren’t few as well. Amongst those experts I’ve met, I only acknowledge two of them. No, it should be two and a half. One of them is that fellow, the Unfettered One. His attainments in the Sword Dao are extraordinary, and I’m far inferior to him. As for the other person… It’s better not to mention that person.”

He gazed at Blood Maiden at this point, and then he continued, “As for the half, it’s her. Her natural talent and ability to control the Blood Domain to such an extent is something I can’t compare to.”

Meanwhile, Yu Ming spoke in a low voice, “Who are you?!”

“Who am I?” The old man chuckled, “Just as you’ve said, I’m just a prisoner.”

He gazed at Yang Ye at this point, “Young Brother, I don’t want to stay here anymore as well. I’ll help you and Blood Maiden stop them. So, can you take me along once she recovers and leaves?”

“Of course!” Yang Ye nodded, “But there’s something I don’t understand. Even your strength is insufficient to leave this place?”

The old man chuckled and said, “I can. However, I’ll die as soon as I leave.”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Why?”

The old man said, “We should have died all those years ago, but that existence was kindhearted and spared us. Even though we didn’t have to die, we were imprisoned here for eternity. As far as your universe is concerned, we’re invaders and sinners. If we force our way out of this place, we’ll be targeted by the Lord of the Heaven Dao of this universe. So, we need someone to keep us concealed. Only two people have such ability, and it’s the Unfettered One and her, Blood Maiden. Because both of them have comprehended a Domain. They can utilize their Domain to conceal our presence from the Lord of the Heaven Dao!”

At this moment, Yang Ye was finally sure. He was sure that they weren’t from this universe. All of these people including the man who gave him the Undying Elemental Body technique and the old man beneath the pool of water were not from this universe. They were from another universe! Or it should be said that besides a few locals of the Ominous Territory, everyone else here was from another universe!

All of them had committed crimes. Just like the old man had said, they were invaders. Obviously, they’d failed, and they were imprisoned for it.

Meanwhile, the old man added, “Even though I can defeat that Eye of the Heaven Dao here, I can’t suppress it. Moreover, if I try to force my way out, then it’ll fight me to the death. Perhaps it might even make more Eyes of the Heaven Dao to come here. However, Blood Maiden is different. If she recovers her strength at the Rebirth Realm, then she can completely suppress the Eye of the Heaven Dao with the combination of her strength and the strength of her Blood Domain!”

Yang Ye finally came to an understanding. They wanted to use Blood Maiden’s Blood Domain. A Domain could conceal their auras, so the Lord of the Heaven Dao of this universe wouldn’t be able to detect them. Otherwise, even if they could escape this place, the Lord of the Heaven Dao would pursue them incessantly!

Yang Ye pondered deeply for a few moments and said, “I can agree on her behalf and promise that she’ll take all of you out of here. However, once all of you leave this place…”

“We’ll leave this universe of yours!” The old man added, “All those years ago, it was greed that caused us to fall to this state. Now, we won’t do it again.”

Yang Ye heaved a sigh of relief in his heart. He had definitely not thought about drawing them over to his side, because that was utterly impossible. Their strength was much stronger than his, so it was impossible for them to agree to follow him. Moreover, even if they did, he wouldn’t dare to accept them. All of them were criminals. If the Lord of the Heaven Dao noticed their presence, then the consequences…

He didn’t know how strong the Lord of the Heaven Dao was, but since the old man was so afraid, he could imagine how terrifying the Lord of the Heaven Dao was. Yang Ye had no doubt that it was absolutely not an existence that he could resist. Go against the Lord of the Heaven Dao? He wasn’t mad!

So, it was best if they left this universe.

However, Yang Ye also wondered if he would encounter any problems because he was helping them escape their prison. Fortunately, even if problems did arise, it would be Blood Maiden’s business, and she would definitely be able to resolve that trouble!

Suddenly, the old man standing in the distance spoke, “Your name is Yang Ye, right?”

Yang Ye turned to look at the old man, “What?”

The old man stared at Yang Ye for a long time and said, “I never expected that our plan which was guaranteed success would actually fail because of you. Based on the natural talent and strength you possess, I presume it won’t be long before you need to ascend to the large world. Unfortunately, my War Pavilion just happens to be guarding it this time. Remember my words. The moment you ascend to the large world is the moment you, Yang Ye, will die!”

As soon as he finished speaking, both his and Yu Ming’s figures started to become ethereal.

They were Rebirth Realm experts, so they were no fools. They were very well aware that they couldn’t kill Blood Maiden when facing the experts of the Ominous Territory. So, they’d decisively chose to flee. Because if they didn’t, then they would definitely die once Blood Maiden woke up.

“Stop them!” Yang Ye’s expression changed when he noticed that they were trying to leave, and Yang Ye immediately drew his sword and swung it. His sword energy was extremely swift and instantly arrived before Yu Ming and the old man. However, his sword energy just shot through them and wasn’t able to do anything.

Yang Ye’s face instantly became gloomy.

“It’s impossible!” The old man with a hunched back said, “I can kill them if they stay and fight. However, if they flee, then I can’t do anything to them. Because I can’t leave this place, but it’s absolutely easy for them to leave. Because they possess powerful spatial treasures that are able to travel through space with ease.”

Yang Ye fell silent for a short while, and then he shook his head and said, “It’s fine. If worse comes to worse, I’ll just do as the Unfettered One and Jian Wuji did. I’ll just fight my way up there!”

The old man glanced at Yang Ye and smiled, “You’re very confident. But you have the right to be confident.”

Yang Ye smiled, “Actually, if it’s possible, I don’t want to be in the limelight. But in life, there are many things that are beyond our control.”

He glanced at the people here and cupped his fist, “Everyone, I thank you on behalf of my second sister. Don’t worry, I’ll definitely fulfil my promise to all of you.”

Those two Rebirth Realm experts hadn’t retreated because of him, they’d retreated because of these experts in front of Yang Ye. It could be said that if they hadn’t come, then he would have no choice but to fight with his life on the line!

He wouldn’t take everyone out of this place, but he would definitely take them out of this place. After all, one couldn’t be ungrateful!

The old man smiled. He was about to speak when he suddenly looked at Blood Maiden, “She’s awake.

Sure enough, as soon as he finished speaking, Blood Maiden suddenly opened her eyes. At the same time, an invisible wave of energy rippled out from her. Yang Ye and the others were caught off guard, and they were pushed around 300m away. As for the old man with a hunched back, he was pushed around 50m away!

The Rebirth Realm!

Everyone here had an extremely solemn expression on their faces. Blood Maiden was no ordinary Rebirth Realm expert. She was already so terrifying at the Dualism Realm, so now that she’d attained the Rebirth Realm, her strength would be…

Blood Maiden stood up, glanced at everyone here, and said, “Thank you!”

All of them nodded to display that it was nothing worth mentioning.

Blood maiden nodded slightly, and then she looked at Yang Ye, “I thought you would flee.”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

Blood Maiden added, “They have good judgment skills. Since you call me second sister, then I won’t try to be courteous about it.” She glanced at the others and continued, “Let’s go!”

As soon as she finished speaking, Blood Maiden stretched her hands forward, and then pulled them in opposite directions. Just like that, the space before her was torn open, and it didn’t take long for a spatial rift to appear here.

Meanwhile, Little Little Sky, the Eye of the Heaven Dao, appeared in the sky above them. After that, a wave of pressure rained down upon them.

Lian Banzhuang and the others became extremely vigilant when they saw the Eye of the Heaven Dao.

Blood Maiden glanced at it for a few moments, and then she stretched her right hand forward. In an instant, a veil of blood enveloped the Eye of the Heaven Dao.

Meanwhile, the Eye of the Heaven Dao suddenly started to tremble violently. Yang Ye’s expression changed drastically at the sight of that. Because that Eye of the Heaven Dao intended to detonate itself!

Blood Maiden frowned as well. Obviously, she hadn’t expected the Eye of the Heaven Dao to actually intend to detonate itself.

“Little Little Sky! Stop this instant!” Suddenly, a voice resounded from Yang Ye’s chest, and then Little Sky appeared before them. As soon as Little Sky appeared, the Eye of the Heaven Dao immediately stopped trying to detonate itself.

Little Sky instantly heaved a sigh of relief, and then she turned to look at Blood Maiden, “Do you want to die?”
