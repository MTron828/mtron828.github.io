Chapter 1422 – Not Very Strong But Extremely Strong!

Yang Ye gazed at Zhuang Weiran, “You recognize that voice?”

Zhuang Weiran nodded, “The young master of Wildlands Stellar Region, Man Tian. I met him once while tempering myself outside the stellar region. I joined a temporary mercenary group, and he was one of them.”

Yang Ye asked, “That fellow who wanted to propose to you?”

She glanced at Yang Ye and said, “Yes.”

The corners of Yang Ye’s mouth curled up slightly. Looks like he refuses to give up!

Yang Ye remained silent for an instant and smiled, “Since he’s here for me, how can I not meet him? Come, let’s go meet that young master of Wildlands Stellar Region.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye turned around and walked out of the hall.

Zhuang Weiran seemed to want to say something as she watched Yang Ye leave. Meanwhile, Ye Liuyun shook her head and said, “Since he has come here to look for Yang Ye, then he clearly refuses to give up. So, it’s pointless no matter what you say. It’s better to just leave it to him. In any case, it’s something he should be doing.”

Zhuang Weiran nodded and said, “Come on, let’s go see what happens!”

As soon as they finished speaking, all of them left the hall.

Beneath the stairs outside the hall was an extremely wide square. Two people were standing at the center of it. One of them was naturally Yang Ye, and the other was Man Tian.

Man Tian was from the Man Clan, just like Man Zhi and the others who were here before. His figure was very huge and much larger than Yang Ye.

“You’re Yang Ye!” Man Tian stared fixedly at Yang Ye, and his gaze was calm yet gloomy.

Yang Ye nodded, “I am!”

Bang!

As soon as Yang Ye finished speaking, Man Zhi suddenly stomped his foot down, and then he transformed into a beam of yellow light that shot towards Yang Ye.

Yang Ye’s eyes instantly narrowed slightly when he saw Man Zhi attack, and a cold glow flashed through his eyes. He didn’t waste his breath, and he just clenched his right fist and slammed it forward.

Bang!

Their fists had just come into contact when a huge expanse of space around them trembled violently, and then they shot backwards. Man Tian moved less than 300m back before he stopped himself, and then he transformed into a pillar of yellow light again and shot at Yang Ye.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye was still moving backwards.

Obviously, Yang Ye’s physical strength was inferior.

Man Tian’s speed was extremely swift, and even space shook in his wake. Once he arrived in front of Yang Ye, he did the same thing he’d done earlier. He clenched his right fist and slammed it at Yang Ye.

Bang!

A wave of powerful force sprayed out from Man Tian’s fist, and the space around him instantly cracked apart.

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly. He swiftly stomped his right foot down and instantly stopped himself. After that, he similarly slammed his fist at Man Tian.

The Brink Laws!

Boom!

A deafening explosion resounded as soon as their attacks collided, and then both of them were pushed back again.

Yang Ye tapped his right foot down after moving around 300m back, and his figure immediately stopped. He glanced at his fist, and he noticed that it had cracked open. Yang Ye remained silent for an instant before he looked up at Man Tian. Needless to say, Man Tian was really quite strong.

He was a Semi-Deity just like Zhuang Weiran, but his physical strength had far surpassed Zhuang Weiran.

Yang Ye flipped his palm, and a sword appeared in his grasp. He wasn’t a real body cultivator but a sword cultivator. So, if he still insisted on using his physical strength when it was clearly inferior to his opponent, then he would really be an idiot. The reason he didn’t use the Sword Precursor or Heaven’s Gravestone was that he’d just advanced into the Voider Realm, and he wanted to practice on someone.

Man Tian slowly clenched his right fist and stared at Yang Ye, “You piece of trash! Are you even worthy of her? I’ll cripple you today, so she’ll understand that you’re not worthy of her at all!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Man Tian stomped his foot down and shot forward like a cannonball. He didn’t make any flashy moves or execute any techniques, and he just slammed his fist at Yang Ye.

Yang Ye’s face was calm. When Man Tian’s fist arrived around 1m away from him, Yang Ye suddenly charged forward and stabbed his sword forward with its blade at a horizontal orientation.

Bang!

Hiss!

Yang Ye moved a few meters back while Man Tian moved almost 300m back. Moreover, his fist had actually been sliced off.

The ability to see through the flaws of an attack and destroy it with one move!

Man Tian glanced at his hand, and his face was extremely gloomy. A moment later, a wisp of viciousness flashed through his eyes. He shook his right hand slightly. In an instant, a wave of terrifying force exploded forth from his right hand, and his sleeve was instantly obliterated. After that, a blood red arm appeared before the eyes of everyone.

Meanwhile, that fist he lost had grown back, but it was blood red as well.

“The Bloodarm!” A wisp of seriousness appeared in Zhuang Weiran’s eyes.

Ye Liuyun asked, “What’s that?”

Zhuang Weiran pondered deeply for a moment and said, “Most of the Man Clan’s members cultivate in the body, and it’s the same for Man Tian. For the sake of fostering him, the experts of the Man Clan captured a Blood Ape at the Deity Realm, and then they fused that Blood Ape into Man Tian’s arm and allowed him to absorb that Blood Ape’s strength and blood with a secret technique. Presently, that arm of his is comparable to a Deity Realm demon beast.”

A Deity!

Ye Liuyun was visibly shocked, “Is Yang Ye in danger?”

Zhuang Weiran looked up at Yang Ye and said, “Just watch!”

Meanwhile, Yang Ye glanced at Man Tian’s blood red arm, and then he stretched out his hand and used a single finger to gesture that Man Tian should come at him. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Man Tian’s face was instantly covered in fury. A moment later, he roared with fury, and then he transformed into a beam of yellow light that shot at Yang Ye. Once he arrived around 3m before Yang Ye, he pulled his right arm back, and then slammed his fist at Yang Ye!

The space around Yang Ye instantly collapsed, and the force within the punch repeatedly pushed Yang Ye backwards within the black hole. But after moving around 3m back, Yang Ye tapped his foot down lightly, and his figure instantly stopped before his figure transformed into a ray of light that shot forward.

Bang!

Hiss!

As soon as they came into contact, Yang Ye was pushed backwards again. This time, he only stopped after being pushed around 300m back. As for Man Tian, he’d been pushed over 600m back. Moreover, there was a hold on his blood red arm, but it wasn’t bleeding.

Ye Liuyun heaved a sigh of relief when she witnessed this scene. Even though she was confident in Yang Ye, she still was quite worried. Because Man Tian didn’t seem weak at all. Especially when she heard that Man Tian’s arm was comparable to a Deity. Fortunately, Yang Ye still had the upper hand.

Meanwhile, Zhuang Weiran said, “He’s getting more and more skilled at locating his opponent’s flaws.”

“It really is a formidable ability!” said Ye Liuyun. She didn’t know much about it. All she knew was that Yang Ye had crushed Man Tian’s technique with ease without utilizing any techniques.

“It isn’t really formidable, it’s extremely formidable!” Meanwhile, Zhuang Weiran added, “A true sword cultivator can destroy all techniques. Unless you have an absolute advantage in speed and strength, it’s impossible to defeat him. Because no matter what technique or move you use, or even an extremely formidable divine ability, he can crush them all.”

She gazed at Yang Ye and continued, “He didn’t have such ability in the past. In the past, he only knew how to use brute force. Yet now, he has truly grasped some of the essence of that ability. So, unless he encounters a Deity like the Celestial Demon Lord, ordinary Deities won’t be able to harm him at all.”

Yang Ye waved his sword lightly, and then numerous marks were instantly created in the space around him. They were an extremely beautiful sight to behold. Yang Ye allowed the tip of his sword to touch the ground while he stretched out his hand and provoked Man Tian again.

Obviously, he was telling Man Tian to continue!

Man Tian stared at Yang Ye. This time, there was a trace of seriousness in his eyes. Obviously, Yang Ye’s strength had far exceeded his expectations. However, he naturally wouldn’t shrink back at a time like this.

A moment later, Man Tian’s entire body shuddered, and then numerous thick black scales appeared all over him. Even his blood red arm was covered in the scales. At the same time, a thin layer of dark light appeared around him.

“Dark Turtle Guard!” Zhuang Weiran spoke abruptly, but the seriousness in her voice was gone this time.

Ye Liuyun was like a curious child and asked, “Dark Turtle Guard?”

Zhuang Weiran explained, “The experts of the Man Clan found him an Inkshell Turtle, and they sealed it within him. So, he can use a secret technique to obtain the ability of that Inkshell Turtle. Even an attack that carried the full strength of a Deity can’t pierce that scale armor. Thus, he just has to activate the scale armor and he’ll be invincible in battle!”

“I suddenly noticed that independent cultivators are really sad!” Ye Liuyun shook her head. Yang Ye was like an independent cultivator and had to rely on himself to gain any equipment. But Man Tian didn’t have to at all. He just had to cultivate because others would get the equipment for him.

Zhuang Weiran nodded slightly, “But independent cultivators have something that the disciples of big clans and powers don’t, and it’s their ability to endure hardships and their character. Especially their mentality. Do you know which part of Yang Ye was the most attractive to me in the past? He never accepted defeat and never compromised. He was ruthless to others, but you’ll notice that there are many occasions when he’s even more ruthless to himself!”

Zhuang Weiran paused for a moment and continued, “That’s how a real man is!”

Ye Liuyun fell silent. Because Zhuang Weiran was absolutely right. Yang Ye’s ruthlessness and his readiness to risk everything was exactly where his charm came from, and it was one of the things that attracted her too!

Suddenly, Man Tian gazed at Zhuang Weiran and howled with fury, “Zhuang Weiran, watch closely. I’ll let you see how much of a piece of trash that fellow you chose is!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Man Tian flashed over to Yang Ye and pointed at his chest while speaking fiercely, “Trash! Aren’t you able to destroy all techniques with a single strike? Come on! Why don’t you pierce through your grandpa’s defenses?!”

Yang Ye glanced at Man Tian and remained silent.

“Come on!” Man Tian walked forward and stopped right in front of Yang Ye, and then he shouted with fury, “I want her to see that your sword and everything you have is trash before me! All of it is trash!”

Yang Ye nodded, and he didn’t waste his breath. He just flipped his left palm, and the ancient sheath appeared in his left grasp. As for the sword in the sheath, it was the Sword Precursor.
