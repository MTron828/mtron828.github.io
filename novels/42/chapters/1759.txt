Chapter 1760 – So, They Die First!

Seek peace?

Yang Ye actually wants to seek peace?

All of them were quite stunned.

Because the person in the Yang Clan who was the least likely to seek peace was Yang Ye. Yet now, he’d said that.

It was very unusual!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye walked into the hall and glanced at them. He smiled, “What? Are you very surprised?”

They nodded.

Yang Ye smiled, “Isn’t that what many of you are thinking?”

They fell silent.

Because Yang Ye was right. Many of them had the desire to seek peace. As far as they were concerned, the Yang Ye was utterly incapable of fighting so many clans at once. So, it would lose, sooner or later.

However, no one dared to raise that suggestion because of Yang Ye and Yang Lianshuang.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye continued, “Everyone, I understand, and I know what you’re worried about. However, let’s just take a step back and consider what’ll happen. Do you think the Ying Clan and those other clans will spare us because we seek peace?”

He shook his head, “They won’t. Clans only pursue their own interests, and they’re very greedy. We’re at our weakest moment right now, so they won’t give up such an opportunity, nor will they give our Yang Clan a chance to rise. So, seeking peace is no different than seeking insult.”

An old man suddenly asked, “Then what should we do now?”

Yang Ye glanced at that old man and smiled, “A good question. However, I can’t answer that. It depends on our patriarch.” He gazed at Yang Lianshuang.

Yang Lianshuang spoke indifferently, “Since we can’t seek peace, we’ll seek war! However, how we fight them is a problem!” She gazed at Yang Ye, “Do you have any ideas?”

Yang Ye fell silent for a moment and said, “A shameless battle!”

Yang Lianshuang asked, “How?”

Yang Ye said, “As shameless as it can be!”

Her eyelids twitched, “Isn’t that no different than saying nothing?”

Yang Ye smiled and said, “Our overall strength is utterly inferior to them. If we go head-on against them, then even if it’s just one of those clans, it’ll be a pyrrhic victory even if we can win. So, we have to act shamelessly, and that means running after we kill!”

Yang Lianshuang frowned, “Running after we kill?”

Yang Ye nodded, “This time, the experts of our Yang Clan aren’t necessary. Just you and I are enough.”

“No!” Suddenly, Yang Lin said, “Both of you are our clan’s pillars of support. Our clan will be finished if anything happens to both of you.”

The others nodded to display their agreement. Yang Ye and Yang Lianshuang couldn’t suffer a mishap at the same time. Otherwise, the Yang Clan would be finished!

Yang Ye said, “I know what you’re worried about, but allow me to be frank. Only Lianshuang and I can sneak into those clans without raising any alarms, kill, and escape safely. Moreover, we have an advantage, and that advantage is an opportunity for us. The old geezers of those clans won’t show themselves for now. So, we’re only able to use our strongest forces against their weakest forces during a period like this one!”Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Yang Lin wanted to say more, but Yang Lianshuang said, “He’s right, those clans haven’t encountered any life threatening danger, so those old geezers won’t show themselves yet. Such a time is exactly the best time for us to exhaust their strength, just like we exhausted the Li Clan’s strength!”

All the experts here fell silent.

A short moment of silence later, Yang Xuan stepped forward, “What if they converge their strength and attack Heaven Void Continent?”

Yang Ye replied, “That day will come, sooner or later. So, we must exhaust as much of their strength as possible before then. Now, they’ve just allied with one another, so they definitely need time to work out everything. That period is the best time for us to attack!”

Yang Xuan gazed at Yang Ye for a long time, and then she nodded and didn’t speak further.

Yang Lin and the others didn’t say anything as well.

Meanwhile, Yang Lianshuang suddenly said, “When shall we begin?”

Yang Ye smiled, “The sooner the better.”

She asked, “How about now?”

Yang Ye smiled, “Exactly what I was thinking!”

Just like that, Yang Ye and Yang Lianshuang left Heaven Void Continent. But very few were aware of it. Only the True Realm experts of the Yang Clan knew.

…

In the boundless starry sky.

Yang Ye and Yang Lianshuang shot through the vast expanse of space like shooting stars.

Yang Ye glanced at her, and then he suddenly sped up. In an instant, he left her behind. However, just a moment passed before Yang Lianshuang appeared beside him again.

Yang Ye glanced at her, and then he sped up again. At this moment, space was torn open in his wake.

It was his fastest speed!

However, Yang Lianshuang was still by his side.

Yang Ye fell silent for a moment, and then he slowed down and gazed at her, “I didn’t expect you to be so fast!”

She shook her head, “Both of us aren’t fast, and we should be called very slow instead. Do you know what’s the fastest thing in this world?”

Yang Ye asked, “What?”

“Light!” She gazed at a huge ball of flames in the depths of the universe, “It’s the fastest. At the very least, it’s the fastest thing known to us. Our speed is faster than the speed of sound, but it’s far inferior from the speed of light!”

Yang Ye glanced at the huge ball of flames and asked, “Are there experts that are faster than it?”

Yang Lianshuang nodded, “Of course. But such experts should be very rare. Because if a person’s speed even surpasses light, then they are very likely to be able to change the future.”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Change the future?”

Yang Lianshuang explained, “It’s a theory from where I used to live. When a person’s speed surpasses light, it’s very likely for that person to see what their future looks like.”

Yang Ye frowned, “How could that be possible?”

She glanced at him, “It’s quite possible. However, it’s very difficult to surpass the speed of light. At the very least, not a single expert amongst the ones I know are capable of accomplishing that. However, we can treat it as a goal!”

Yang Ye nodded slightly, “That’s true. Right, how fast is the speed of light?”

Yang Lianshuang spoke flatly, “299,792,458 meters per second!”

His current speed was only around a million meters per second, and it was even after he enhanced his speed with numerous Laws. But the speed of light was that fast…

Yang Ye looked up at the huge ball of flames and gazed at her, “How do you know its speed?”

Yang Lianshuang replied, “It was in a book!”

Yang Ye asked, “Is it accurate?”

She thought for a moment and replied, “Even though most of it is nonsense, some can be trusted.”

Yang Ye asked, “You spoke about a place you used to live in. So, you’re not from the medium universe?”

She shook her head slightly.

Yang Ye asked, “Then where?”

She replied, “A place that’s much smaller than this place.”

Yang Ye’s curiosity had been fully aroused, “Are there many experts there?”

She thought for a moment and replied, “Not many, but some things there are quite amazing.”

Yang Ye asked, “What things?”

She replied, “A thing that can explode. Actually, I feel like making some of them now. If I toss them at the Ying Clan… Hehe, there’ll be so many mushroom clouds.”

Yang Ye asked, “What level would they be at?”

She thought for a moment and replied, “They should be beyond the True Rank.”

Yang Ye glanced at her, “Now that makes me quite curious about where you came from. Shall we go have a look when we’re free?”

She shook her head, “It’s best if you don’t go.”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Why?”

She replied, “I’m afraid you’ll destroy it if you go there!”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

Meanwhile, Yang Lianshuang suddenly said, “Actually, you won’t like it!”

Yang Ye was bewildered, “Why?”

She explained, “Because what we eat and drink has poison in it, and the amount of spirit energy there is pitiable. Besides that, even our air is poisonous.”

Yang Ye glanced at her and said, “The people where you lived are really quite amazing. They were actually able to survive in such an environment!”

Yang Lianshuang nodded, “I think so too!”

Yang Ye didn’t linger on this topic. He glanced at the surroundings and said, “Where do you think we should go first?”

She fell silent for a moment and replied, “The Ying Clan!”

Yang Ye gazed at her, “Why?”

She spoke indifferently, “This is our first counterattack after the Ying Clan and those other clans formed an alliance. Since it’s our first counterattack, we have to make a show of strength. Only by crippling the Ying Clan can we deter the remaining clans.” She gazed at Yang Ye and continued, “You probably chose the Ying Clan too, right?”

Yang Ye nodded, “But my thought process wasn’t that complicated. The reason I chose the Ying Clan is because I can’t stand the sight of them. The world was once so peaceful, but they just had to be so annoying and cause so much trouble. So, I’ll kill them first!”

Yang Lianshuang felt speechless.
