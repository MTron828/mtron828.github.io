Chapter 230 – Battle!

In the bamboo forest, the Shadowhunter Leopard that was a few dozens of times larger than Zi Xiu was blasted flying by a single punch from him, and then he walked step by step into the depths of the bamboo forest.

Because of Daoist Zui, the Darkbeast Empire naturally didn’t dare to break the rules and send a Darkbeast at the Spirit Rank or above to pursue and kill Yang Ye. However, it didn’t mean that the Darkbeast Empire intended to let Yang Ye off. Since it couldn’t dispatch Spirit Rank Darkbeasts, then what about King Rank Darkbeasts? If a King Rank Darkbeast killed Yang Ye, then even Daoist Zui couldn’t say anything about it!

So, he’d come here. No matter what, the Darkbeast Empire could absolutely not allow and didn’t dare allow the violet mink to be controlled by a human. Because that mysterious violet mink’s threat to their Darkbeast Race was too huge!

Zi Xiu didn’t want to become enemies with Yang Ye and that mysterious violet mink as well. However, he had no choice this time. Besides the fact that the violet mink was too great of a threat to the Darkbeast Empire, it was also because it was the Beast Emperor of the Darkbeast Empire that gave them the order!

Yes, this time, the true higher-ups of the Darkbeast Empire had made a move.

Suddenly, Zi Xiu stopped because Yang Ye had arrived in front of him.

As he gazed at Yang Ye, Zi Xiu said in a deep voice, “You shouldn’t have stayed in the Grand Myriad Mountains!”

Yang Ye grinned and said, “Looks like your Darkbeast Empire insists on taking my life!”

“Hand that mysterious violet mink over and I’ll let you go!” Zi Xiu spoke in a deep voice.

Yang Ye shook his head and said, “Leave right now and I’ll spare your life, alright?”

Zi Xiu’s eyes narrowed, and he didn’t say anything else. Yes, there was no need for him to say anything else now. His figure flashed and shot explosively towards Yang Ye. He clenched his right hand tightly, and it emanated a sharp whistle as it shot through the air and smashed directly towards Yang Ye’s face!

Right when Zi Xiu arrived 10m away from Yang Ye, his pupils suddenly constricted while his figure stopped abruptly. However, it was still a little too late. A fine sound of air being torn apart resounded, and then a fluctuation that was extremely difficult to notice with the naked eyes appeared soundlessly in front of Zi Xiu. In the next moment, the clothes before his chest were directly blasted apart to reveal Zi Xiu’s bulging and perfect muscles!

A wisp of fresh blood appeared mysterious on his chest!

It was naturally Yang Ye’s Sword Control Technique and Hidden Sword that did all of this. However, it was a slight pity because the Hidden Sword has just torn through Zi Xiu’s defenses when it was forcefully grasped by Zi Xiu’s right hand, causing it to be unable to move forward at all!

As he held tightly onto the sword, Zi Xiu raised his head to look at Yang Ye while his eyes were filled with a solemn expression. He said, “What a mysterious sword and sword technique. I’ve underestimated you since the beginning!”

Yes, if his physical body wasn’t extremely strong, if his senses weren’t extremely acute, and if his reaction speed wasn’t extremely swift, then this mysterious attack would have probably pierced through his heart by now!

Yang Ye didn’t waste his breath. With a flip of his wrist, Violet Spirit appeared in his hand, and then his figure flashed. This time, it was his turn to shoot explosively towards Zi Xiu. He didn’t hold back, and he raised his speed to its limits, allowing him to instantly arrive in front of Zi Xiu. After that, his 3rd level Sword Intent surged out madly as he swiftly slashed Violet Spirit at Zi Xiu!

At the moment he saw Zi Xiu, flames of rage had instantly arisen in the bottom of Yang Ye’s heart. Because of the little fellow, he’d always held back against Darkbeasts, and he’d never taken the initiative to look for trouble with them. However, the Darkbeast Empire had repeatedly come looking for trouble with him and the little fellow!

Since it was like that, then why should he hold back? So, this time, he directly utilized his 3rd level Sword Intent with the intention of annihilating Zi Xiu with a single strike.

Since they were going to shed all pretenses and become enemies, then it was best to do it thoroughly. In any case, he wouldn’t complain about getting another King Rank Inner Core!

Zi Xiu’s expression immediately changed violently when he sensed Yang Ye’s 3rd level Sword Intent. The invisible Sword Intent caused him to truly and fully sense the aura of death!

He didn’t dare be careless at all. Zi Xiu shouted loudly, and he held the Hidden Sword in his hand and moved it upward to directly block Yang Ye’s attack. Because his strength was truly too great, the Hidden Sword actually tore the air in its path into pieces and caused terrifying explosions of the air to resound!

Bang!

As soon as these two terrifying forces collided, an enormous bang instantly resounded on the battlefield. Zi Xiu’s pupils constricted while soreness immediately surged up onto his right arm. At the same time, the ground where he stood actually collapsed in an instant, and as he fell downward, Yang Ye twisted his wrist and flicked Violet Spirit upward!

Sure enough, Violet Spirit that contained terrifying Sword Intent flicked the Hidden Sword in Zi Xiu’s hand flying. After he flicked the Hidden Sword away, a wisp of a ruthless expression flashed in Yang Ye’s eyes, and with a twist of his wrist, Violet Spirit swept towards Zi Xiu’s neck!

For the first time, shock appeared in Zi Xiu’s eyes when he saw Violet Spirit sweeping horizontally towards him. Obviously, he’d never imagined that Yang Ye’s strength would actually surpass his own while it was boosted by Yang Ye’s 3rd level Sword Intent!

Bang!

Amidst a furious roar, Zi Xiu’s figure shook, and then it suddenly expanded. His entire body started to transform, and in less than the time for a single breath to be completed, Zi Xiu who was originally in the form of a human had become a colossus that was large like a mountain!

At this moment, Zi Xiu was an enormous ape that was around 24m tall and 10m wide, and his entire body was pitch black. Unlike other Darkbeasts, Zi Xiu’s true form was extremely similar to humans. Of course, the difference in size between him and humans was like the gap between the heavens and the earth.

Hiss!

Even though Zi Xiu had returned to his true form, Yang Ye’s sword had still pierced into his neck with ease. But Yang Ye’s sword was like a toothpick before Zi Xiu’s enormous figure. However, the terrifying force contained within Violet Spirit had still caused an enormous gap to appear on Zi Xiu’s neck, and then blood instantly sprayed out like a fountain!

Roar!

The sharp pain that came from his neck caused Zi Xiu to raise his head and roar furiously, and then he raised his enormous right palm and directly slapped it down towards Yang Ye who stood in front of him!

Yang Ye’s pupils constricted. He spun Violet Spirit around and utilized it to block in front of him!

Bang!

The terrifying strength behind Zi Xiu’s enormous palm blasted Yang Ye flying, and he flew for almost 150m before he descended to the ground. After that, his figure was dragged backward on the ground for around another 30m. In the end, he collided with an enormous bamboo, and his figure finally stopped after it broke from the collision!

Zi Xiu’s enormous eyes revealed a wisp of a ferocious and savage glow. He stomped his right foot on the ground, causing the entire ground to immediately tremble violently, and his figure relied on the counterforce from this to shoot like a cannonball towards Yang Ye.

At this moment, Yang Ye had stood up, and he revealed a wisp of a solemn expression in his eyes when he sensed the soreness throughout his body. This Steel Ape’s strength was quite terrifying, and if his physical body and strength hadn’t attained a huge increase before this, then he would have probably been unable to stand up again after suffering that attack from before!

As he gazed at Zi Xiu who pressed down towards him like a mountain, Yang Ye took a deep breath, and then the golden profound energy within his body surged madly towards the Violet Spirit sword that he held in his hand. As his golden profound energy surged incessantly into it, dazzling golden and violet light erupted once more from Violet Spirit!

At a certain moment in time, Yang Ye pointed Violet Spirit directly at Zi Xiu, and then he stomped the ground with his right foot and shot out explosively towards Zi Xiu.

The boost from the golden profound energy and 3rd level Sword Intent formed Yang Ye’s strongest ordinary attack. At this moment, Yang Ye’s strength and speed had arrived at their peak states. Under such circumstances, the might carried the Violet Spirit sword in Yang Ye’s hand was extremely terrifying. Everywhere it passed, obvious ripples appeared in space, and it seemed like space would be pierced apart at any moment!

When he sensed the terrifying force contained within the Violet Spirit sword in Yang Ye’s hand, Zi Xiu’s enormous eyes instantly narrowed slightly. He didn’t dare be careless at all, and he roared furiously. A layer of pitch black and brilliant scales instantly appeared on his palm, and then he slapped it forcefully at Yang Ye.

At this moment, Zi Xiu hadn’t held back at all, and he’d utilized his life-saving ability. After all, this scale armor was equivalent to an Earth Rank Dark Treasure. Coupled with the formidable defenses of his own physical body, his current defenses had arrived at an inconceivable height.

Clang!

Violet Spirit’s tip stabbed the enormous palm that was covered in scales, and then a clear and ringing sound of metal colliding resounded like a thunderclap!

Zi Xiu was instantly delighted when he saw Yang Ye was unable to break through his defenses. However, right at this moment, Yang Ye shouted loudly. “Break!”

Hiss!

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye suddenly spun the sword in his hand, and then Violet Spirit instantly sliced through the scale armor. After that, Yang Ye pierced through Zi Xiu’s enormous palm along with his sword....Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates
