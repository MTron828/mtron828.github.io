Chapter 2544

The woman in a black dress stopped in the clouds, and as soon as she stopped, a trace of blood seeped out from the corner of her mouth again!

Those attacks hadn’t just injured her, it had heavily injured her!

Her ability was mysterious, but it wasn’t capable of ignoring everything. While she was independent of this world, she wasn’t able to fully escape it. She was just relying on her Domain to temporarily accomplish something like that.

There was a price to pay for accomplishing that!

She looked off into the distant sky with an icy cold gaze that carried the desire to kill!

“Return!” Meanwhile, a voice resounded in her mind, “We underestimated his strength!”

She spoke coldly, “I can kill him!”

The voice stated, “I know. But you won’t survive either, right?”

She fell silent.

The voice said, “Our forces have entered the West Region, and we’re just waiting for the Guardians now. Don’t attack the Ancient Sword Sect during this time. When the time comes, all of us will attack and annihilate them.”

She fell silent for a long time, and then vanished on the spot.

The Ancient Sword Sect.

Yang Ye led the elite disciples back to the Ancient Sword Sect, and then he immediately returned to his abode before entering the Primordial Pagoda.

Sword Scroll appeared by his side and asked, “What is it?”

Yang Ye spoke solemnly, “During my battle with that woman from the Soul Sect, I realized that I’m still lacking in many aspects. She is probably not the strongest in the Soul Sect, but I can’t do anything to her in battle. If…”

“You’re mistaken!” She suddenly said, “You shouldn’t think like this!”

Yang Ye gazed at her, and she explained softly, “She isn’t alone, she has the entire Soul Sect behind her. If she fights you alone, you have a very high chance of defeating her. The reason you are feeling pressured is because she has the Soul Sect’s support. But don’t forget that you’re not alone as well, you have the Ancient Sword Sect. There are around 3,000 disciples in the sect, and these sword cultivators aren’t useless! Moreover, the Ancient Sword Sect still has some resources and reserves after existing for so many years.”

She paused for a moment and continued, “Of course, you must improve yourself too. Your sword intent is at the Lord Realm, and you’re very strong in every other aspect. But your cultivation and body are slightly weak. The Three World Realm isn’t enough at all.”

Yang Ye gazed at her and laughed bitterly, “I can’t do anything about that! They aren’t things that can be just improved like that! If I go too slow, my strength won’t be sufficient, but if I go too fast, my cultivation won’t be stable!”

She replied softly, “True, it can’t be rushed!”

Yang Ye seemed to have thought of something and asked, “How many Divine Treasures does the sect have?”

She replied, “A total of 26 have been collected since the ancient times. They have been passed down for generations, and they are the greatest resource of the sect.”

26!

Yang Ye nodded. Needless to say, it was a huge amount. After all, he didn’t even have 10 right now!

If the previous sect masters of the sect were aware of Yang Ye’s thoughts, they would spit out blood from their anger. How many years had it taken the sect to collect this many Divine Treasures? But how old was Yang Ye and how many Divine Treasures did he have?

Sword Scroll suddenly asked, “Why are you asking about that?”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and replied, “Get all of those Divine Treasures, and then distribute them to the most outstanding disciples of the sect.”

Sword Scroll was slightly hesitant, “But…”

Yang Ye laughed bitterly, “Sword Scroll, if the Ancient Sword Sect is gone, what’s the point of having those Divine Treasures? If we don’t give it to our own, should we just let the Soul Sect have them?”

Sword Scroll nodded, “I understand!”

Yang Ye continued, “We need to improve our morale, and just a few words won’t be enough to accomplish that. We must use our actions! Words are just words, but Divine Treasures are real. It isn’t just Divine Treasures, get all the other treasures too! It’s not just for them to become stronger, it’s for them to understand that they will live and die with the sect!”

Sword Scroll nodded, “Alright, I’ll get it done!”

Yang Ye nodded and said, “There’s one more thing. The other powers of Eternal Kingdom aren’t taking any action, right?”

Sword Scroll spoke solemnly, “They aren’t Obviously, they just wish to reap the rewards but refuse to participate in the battle. It’s even to the extent that they may wish for nothing more than to see both sides suffer terrible losses. Once the Soul Sect is weakened, they can take from the Soul Sect too! Of course, they may act if the Soul Sect fails to crush us. After all, the Ancient Sword Sect represents a huge amount of benefits, and all of them would like a piece of it!”

Yang Ye sighed softly, “How will these clans and powers ever unite to fight against the desolate race?”

Sword Scroll fell silent.

Yang Ye continued, “I don’t know what the overall strength of the desolate race is like, but I do know that they are extremely united, and they are truly one! But the Eternal Kingdom is still scheming against each other, even until now! As they saw, humans are best at killing each other!”

Sword Scroll shook her head slightly, “They won’t unite until it’s a moment of life and death. Just like all those years ago, Eternal Kingdom was still engaging in internal strife when war was approaching, and the Di Clan was driven out of the Eternal Kingdom right before the war. Only when many die and they lose a lot will they truly unite, and only then will they abandon the selfish desires they have.”

Yang Ye shook his head and smiled. He wasn’t placing his hopes in the desolate race, and he was just sighing with emotion about his thoughts.

Since he’d started on his path of cultivation in Profound Continent, Yang Ye had experienced many, many incidents like this.

Yang Ye started to train like a madman.

Training the body!

Just like the other demons, Yang Ye went to the pool of lightning and used the Darkvoid Divine Lightning there to temper his body.

Regardless of whether it was him or the other demons, all of them had to grow stronger!

After Yang Ye made a request, the pool of lightning sent even stronger bolts of lightning at them!

Every bolt was truly an “enjoyable” experience!

Even the dragon couldn’t help but howl before them in the beginning!

It was worse for Yang Ye, of course. It was worse than death!

Deep within the pool of lightning, Lei Lin sat on a bolt of lightning and was gulping down Lightning Essence.

After eating for a while, she seemed to have thought of something, and she put the essence aside before resting her chin on her hands, “Snowy, Erya, when are you coming back?”

Outside the Primordial Pagoda.

On this way, a woman arrived at the foot of the mountain which housed the Ancient Sword Sect.

She had a huge saber on her shoulder, and she had just one arm!

Her left arm was empty, and she was chewing on a blade of grass!

She seemed quite carefree!

She looked up at the sect, “What the heck?! He actually became a sect master! Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Meanwhile, a sword cultivator appeared before her. The sword cultivator glanced at her and asked, “May I know who you are?”

The woman waved her hand, “Tell your sect master to come here. I’m going to give him a good beating! Don’t worry, I won’t kill him!”

The sword cultivator frowned slightly, “Who are you?”

She glanced at the sword cultivator, “Come! Let me see how strong the sword cultivators of your Ancient Sword Sect are!”

As soon as she finished speaking, the saber on her shoulder shot forward!

The sword cultivator’s expression changed drastically. His sword intent surged out from him while he stabbed his sword forward!

Sword and saber collided.

Hiss!

Crack!

The sword cultivator watched with astonishment as the sword actually cracked apart, and then he sensed a powerful wave of force slam against his right arm and blast him away.

She shook her head and lowered her saber, “Weak!”

Meanwhile, Gu Nan appeared before her. He sized up the woman and was about to speak when Nether Maiden suddenly appeared before her. The woman was stunned upon seeing Nether Maiden and said, “Ninth Sister, you’re here?”

A rare smile appeared on Nether Maiden’s face, “Sister!”

She was the pig-riding woman and saber cultivator who was part of Nether Pavilion!

Meanwhile, Nether Maiden gazed at her left arm, and it was completely empty. Nether Maiden’s face instantly turned gloomy, “What happened?”

The pig-riding woman cracked a smile, “It’s nothing. I just fought with someone and lost an arm. Right, I lost that pig of mine too.”

Her smile froze when she spoke up to this point.

Nether Maiden walked over to her and spoke softly, “Let’s head inside first!”

They vanished into the distance.

Gu Nan spoke softly on the spot, “The Sect Master’s friend?”

…

War Dimension.

The abyss.

A black robed figure stood at the edge of the abyss and bowed slightly toward it, “I’m the Soul Sect’s Soul Exalt, and I would like to meet the Abyss Lord!”

A moment of silence ensued, and then an icy cold voice resounded, “Fuck off!”

The black robed man hesitated for a moment and was about to speak. Meanwhile, something shot up from below and slammed against his chest.

Boom!

The Soul Exalt took a few steps back, and then his body exploded apart! Only his soul remained!

Astonishment covered his face while terror filled his eyes!

It was a head with its eyes wide open that had hit him just now!

The Soul Exalt didn’t dare to say another word. He just bowed and was about to leave. However, a sword cultivator in a cloud white robe walked over from the side!

The Soul Exalt frowned slightly, “Fuck off!”

Obviously, he was trying to curry favor with the expert at the bottom of the abyss.

The middle aged sword cultivator glanced at him, ignored him, and continued walking toward the abyss.

The Soul Exalt’s face turned gloomy from the sight of this, and then he claws at the middle aged sword cultivator!

It was a very fast and powerful attack!

It was absolutely capable of easily annihilating a Lord Realm expert!

Meanwhile, the sword cultivator stopped walking!
