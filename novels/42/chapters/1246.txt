Chapter 1247 – Willing To Do Anything!

Yang Ye gazed at the beautiful woman in palace attire for a long time, and then he said, “I’ll let all of you live!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he started walking towards the exit, and Yun Banqing quickly followed him.

Suddenly, the beautiful woman arrived before Yang Ye, and she slowly knelt down before him, “You’re the founding ancestor’s successor, and we’re willing to submit to you.” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Some of the other sword cultivators hurriedly came over to Yang Ye, and then they knelt down slowly just like she had.

Yang Ye glanced at them and said, “All of you don’t want to submit to me, you just want me to take you out of here!”

The beautiful woman looked Yang Ye in the eyes and said, “Take us out of this place and we’ll submit to you!” In their opinion, they were willing to do anything to leave this place!

“I don’t need it!” Yang Ye continued out of the hall once he finished speaking.

Meanwhile, the beautiful woman suddenly shouted, “Why?”

Yang Ye stopped and said, “Do you know why I wanted to come and talk with all of you? Because I’d intended to take all of you out of here. Unfortunately, all of you didn’t choose to talk with me, and you chose to take my body instead. From the moment all of you made that choice, we were enemies. I should have killed all of you, but I’ll give Jian Wuji face and spare you. However, every person must take responsibility for their own choices. Now, it’s time for all of you to take responsibility for your own choices.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he swiftly left the hall with Yun Banqing.

The beautiful woman and the others within the hall had despair all over their faces.

Caged!

They had to continue living in this cage forever, ceaselessly look for bodies to seize, and drag out their existence here.

Despair, then came hope, but despair came once more....

The beautiful woman looked out of the hall for a very long time before she said, “Everyone, I don’t want to continue living. Farewell!”

As soon as she finished speaking, a wisp of scarlet red suddenly seeped out the corner of her mouth. Her eyes were still open, and she was still looking out of the hall, but there was no color in her eyes.

“Everyone, farewell!” Another voice resounded, and it didn’t take long for a figure to stiffen.

“Farewell!”

“Farewell!”

“Farewell!”

10 breaths of time later, there wasn’t a single sound of someone breathing within the hall, and it was absolutely silent!

Yang Ye stopped moving outside the hall, and he remained silent for a moment before shaking his head lightly. After that, he continued forward.

Yun Banqing said, “Their strength wasn’t bad!”

“I know!” said Yang Ye. All of them were Emperors and Voiders in the past, and their sword intent was practically at the Void Rank. Especially the beautiful woman in palace attire. She was entirely capable of fighting numerous Emperors on her own.

Yun Banqing asked, “Then why didn’t you take them in or refine their corpses into puppets?”

Yang Ye replied, “Over 10,000 years of being imprisoned here has made them lose the dignity of a sword cultivator and has made them stop at nothing. So long as they can live, they can constantly go to lower lows. Of course, everyone wants to live, and there’s nothing wrong with that. However, I don’t need such people. If they enter the Sword Alliance, they will only bring a negative impact. Moreover, they frequently take the bodies of others, so it’s impossible for them to advance further. Thus, if they want to continue living, they’ll definitely continue taking the bodies of others....”

Yun Banqing nodded slightly, “Then why didn’t you refine them into puppets?”

Yang Ye shook his head slightly, “In the past, I thought that I could refine an endless number of puppets, but I recently noticed that I can’t. Every single puppet is mentally linked to me. If I have too many, the burden on my mind would be too great. Just like this very moment, coupled with the puppets I had in the past, I have almost 20 now. Moreover, all of them are Emperors. I’m almost unable to endure the overall burden they represent. If I’m to refine more, I’m afraid that my mind might collapse!”

He’d noticed this problem when he refined those 4 Sword Servants earlier. It made him feel quite regretful because it meant that he could only have 20 Sword Servants at most. Of course, as his strength grew and his mental strength grew, he would naturally be able to refine even more. So, he had to improve his cultivation as soon as possible!

Cultivation was the foundation of everything!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly turned to look at Yun Banqing, “I wasn’t intentionally trying to tease you on purpose when I pinched your chin earlier. I’m sorry!”

Yun Banqing gazed at him and said, “So you did it on purpose?”

Yang Ye’s face twitched. He was about to speak when she said, “There’s no need to explain. I’m not that shy!”

Yang Ye nodded slightly, “Your mother and younger brother should be fine for now, right?”

She pondered deeply for a moment and said, “They should be fine for now, but we must get to the Yun Clan before the Imperial Oceanic Shuttle of Oceanview City returns. Because once it does, the news of me killing Yun Tianming would definitely spread. At that time, my mother and younger brother would be in a....”

Yang Ye said, “I understand. Once I’m done here, I’ll immediately head to the Yun Clan with you and have a look at the Veiled Region.”

Yun Banqing gazed at him and said, “Thank you!”

Yang Ye smiled, “I’m doing all of this so that you’ll work diligently for me in the future. So, you don’t have to be too grateful!”

Yun Banqing glanced at him and said, “I sent people to investigate you, but you’re really different from what I imagined!”

Yang Ye smiled, “What did you think I was like?”

She replied, “You wouldn’t get angry at me, right?”

He smiled, “I won’t!”

She said, “Based on your past, I felt that you were very immature, brainless, impulsive, rash, headstrong.... In short, you’re an utterly rash fellow, and you aren’t worthy of being the Sword Alliance’s master. Because you don’t consider the overall situation at all and you do everything based on your own personal whims. Such a person wouldn’t live for long....”

Yang Ye’s face was dark.

She glanced at him and spoke softly, “You’re angry?”

Yang Ye replied, “No! But I think that you can just skip to the but.”

“Alright!” She seemed to be smiling slightly as she spoke, “But after I traveled with you for the last few days, I noticed that you’re actually very meticulous behind your rashness, and you consider most things before taking action and even have a plan to deal with the situation. Besides that, you don’t just use force to deal with things. Of course, if you can use force, then you seem to always just use force to deal with it. While it seems to be rash, when I think about it carefully, it actually is the simplest and most effective method to deal with things.”

Yang Ye revealed a smile, “Are you praising me?”

She gazed at him and spoke seriously, “There are definitely many women who like you, right?”

Yang Ye was stunned. A short while passed before he said, “Why do you ask that question?”

Yun Banqing answered, “Many experts innately look down upon the weak and give handouts to them. But throughout this time we’ve been together, while your strength is countless times superior to mine and made me an utter weakling before you, you really respected me all along the way. Besides that, you never acted like that to me. Just like moments before this, you apologized for pinching my chin. Actually, it wasn’t necessary. Not only was it unnecessary, I should feel grateful. Because you were saving me. However, you apologized because we’re equal in your heart.”

Yang Ye glanced at her and said, “You thought quite a lot about it.”

“Women usually think quite a bit!” She continued, “The strong are respected on the continent, and only strength would make others respect you. But while I was much weaker than you and am even a woman, you still really respected me. Now, I kind of understand why so many are willing to follow you. It’s because you respect others!”

Yang Ye smiled, “Even I didn’t notice that I had such a strong point.”

She continued, “Most importantly, you aren’t doing it intentionally to rope others over to your side. I can sense that you’re doing it because it’s part of your nature!”

Yang Ye shook his head and smiled, “Stop praising me. I would be filled with vain if you continued.” He gazed at her and continued, “You’re extremely gorgeous, so why wear a veil?”

She replied, “I’d face a lot of trouble if I didn’t!”

Yang Ye was stunned, and then he nodded, “Right, based on your appearance, it really is very easy for it to draw trouble to you. However, trouble will still come easily even if you wear that veil.”

She asked, “Why?”

Yang Ye smiled, “The more mysterious something is, the more attractive it is. Wearing a veil will only attract the attention of even more.”

“Then I won’t!” She removed it while she spoke.

Yang Ye nodded to himself when he saw her appearance. Needless to say, she really was very beautiful. She was the type of woman that one couldn’t look away from. Beautiful things were always able to draw the attention of others. Especially beautiful women in the eyes of men, and Yang Ye was naturally a man!

Of course, he was merely appreciating her beauty because he had numerous wives already.

A slight smile curled up on the corners of Yang Ye’s face when he thought of Su Qingyi, Xiao Yuxi, and the others. After that, he withdrew his gaze.

Meanwhile, Yun Banqing glanced at him but didn’t speak a word.

The two of them didn’t speak another word, and they just sped up towards the main hall.

After traveling for over 2 hours, Yang Ye and Yun Banqing had solemn expressions on their faces. Because sword intent had appeared around them, and it was unlike the sword intent from before. It was Rebirth Rank sword intent.

As they went further, the sword intent grew sharper and fiercer. Besides that rays of light and sword energy ceaselessly appeared in the surroundings. But the light and sword energy weren’t aimed at them, and it seemed like they were coming from damaged formations.

“Be careful!” Yun Banqing glanced at the surroundings before moving closer to Yang Ye. Any single ray of light or sword energy wasn’t something that she could resist. It could be said that just getting struck by one would equal to death or being severely injured!

Yang Ye nodded slightly, and then he emanated his Rebirth Rank sword intent to resist the sword intent in the surroundings. The rays of light and sword energy were nothing because they couldn’t even get close to him, but the Rebirth Rank sword intent in the surroundings was quite strong. If he didn’t resist it with his sword intent, then the pressure it placed upon him was immense!

However, right at the moment he released his sword intent, something unexpected occurred!
