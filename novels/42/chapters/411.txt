Chapter 412 – The Question Regarding Children!

Xiao Yuxi stared at Yang Ye, and their eyes met. The two of them were very close to the point that Yang Ye could clearly smell the faint fragrance that came from her. Even though an icy cold blade was against his neck, his heart still couldn’t help but thump.

Xiao Yuxi was very beautiful, and her beauty wasn’t inferior to any of the women by Yang Ye’s side. She possessed exquisite features, a jade white complexion, and eyes that were as clear as limpid water during the autumn. Even though an icy cold expression frequently resided on her face, there was no denying that she was extremely beautiful and attractive.

Xiao Yuxi was different from Su Qingshi. Su Qingshi had a form of lofty coldness, and she was cold to the bone. She was like a 10,000-year-old block of ice that was cold no matter who she faced, and it kept others away from her.

Xiao Yuxi, on the other hand, was cold on the outside and warm on the inside. She was only cold on the surface, or to be more precise, she utilized that coldness to protect herself. Once one got to know her and obtained her trust, then she would inadvertently reveal her cute side.

Xiao Yuxi’s face turned red again when she arrived so close to Yang Ye. However, she forced herself to remain calm and didn’t choose to retreat when she noticed the smiling expression in Yang Ye’s eyes, and she moved closer instead.

At this moment, she could feel the heat Yang Ye emanated when he breathed.

Xiao Yuxi’s face grew even redder. The glow on her curved saber had vanished as well. Meanwhile, her saber had been brought close to Yang Ye’s neck just now, but it was just before his neck now!

As she moved the saber closer to Yang Ye’s neck, Xiao Yuxi didn’t dare to look at him while she said, “You... you aren’t allowed to bully me, or I’ll kill you!”

As if she was trying to show that she wasn’t joking, the curved saber in her hand moved closer to Yang Ye’s neck, but when it touched Yang Ye’s skin, her hand instantly moved back by a few centimeters as if she’d been shocked by electricity!

Yang Ye chuckled as he stretched out his hand and placed it around her waist, and then he said in a light voice, “Yuxi, are we Dao Companions?”

Dao Companions! Xiao Yuxi’s face turned even redder when she heard these words, and then she hurriedly shook her head and said, “No!”

“But we’ve already done the things that Dao Companions should!” said Yang Ye in a light voice.

“I....” Her face grew even redder to the point it seemed like blood would drip out at any moment.

At this moment, Xiao Yuxi’s face was red like a peach blossom, and she seemed gorgeous beyond comparison amidst her embarrassment. Her beauty simply caused all things to dim in comparison.

Yang Ye was stunned by this scene, and then he couldn’t help but embrace her before he pressed his lips down onto Xiao Yuxi’s attractive red lips.

Xiao Yuxi’s figure stiffened, and then the curved saber in her hand gradually drooped down....

Xiao Yuxi’s lips were very soft and sweet-smelling, and they even carried a trace of sweetness. Her waist was very supple and fine, and it felt as if it was completely without any bones. Of course, there was another part of her that was softer and finer. Moreover, it was even very smooth and delicate...

They were in broad daylight, after all, so Yang Ye knew his limits. He kissed Xiao Yuxi for a while before their lips parted. Yang Ye smiled as he gazed at Xiao Yuxi who had her eyes closed tightly with a blush on her face, and then he pecked her lips again. After that, he seemed to be announcing his ownership as he said, “Yuxi, you’re my Dao Companion from today onward!”

Xiao Yuxi’s face was red as she gave him an almost imperceptible nod. Instead of calling it a nod, it could even be considered as a slight movement of the head.

He knew Xiao Yuxi was shy and making her nod was already at the limit. So, Yang Ye didn’t provoke her, and he merely smiled and hugged her.

Yang Ye really enjoyed this feeling because he’d never experienced such a feeling. The hugs he shared with that ‘temptress’, Qin Xiyue, was mostly driven by lust. As for Su Qingshi, they’d merely hugged once when they were completely conscious, and it hadn’t even lasted for two breaths of time....

Under such circumstances, how could he have possibly felt anything?

Yang Ye really liked hugging Xiao Yuxi because he felt very satisfied and blessed while they were in each other’s arms like this.

As he gazed at the beauty in his arms, Yang Ye said to himself, Actually, I don’t really demand much....

Yang Ye thought of a saying — I’m a kind person at heart, but what can I do when reality forces the kind to evil?

There were always many things that one was incapable of resisting while living in this world, and there were things that he had to do even if he didn’t like it. After all, the only way to control his own fate and do what he wanted in this world was to possess strength!

Everything was empty talk without strength!

After a short while passed, Xiao Yuxi suddenly said, “Will I have a child?”

“Uh!” Yang Ye was stunned.

Xiao Yuxi blushed as she said, “If I do, then it’ll belong to you. I... I don’t know how to raise a child.”

Yang Ye was speechless.

“But I can teach him how to use the saber, and you can teach him how to use the sword. So, he’ll definitely become extremely formidable!” Xiao Yuxi continued speaking while blushing, and her voice carried embarrassment but there was even more happiness amidst this embarrassment. Moreover, there was a trace of anticipation and hope as well.

Yang Ye felt as if he’d been struck by something when he saw the anticipation and hope in her eyes. He took a deep breath before he leaned down to kiss her on the forehead, and then he said in a gentle voice, “We will. We definitely will!”

As if she’d sensed the slight change in Yang Ye’s mood, Xiao Yuxi discarded her embarrassment and placed her hands on Yang Ye’s waist while she pressed herself against him.

“I’m going back to the southern territory,” said Yang Ye.

“I’m going with you!” said Xiao Yuxi.

Yang Ye shook his head and said, “It’ll be very dangerous this time.”

Xiao Yuxi raised her head to look at Yang Ye as she said, “Aren’t Dao Companions supposed to share life and death together?”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

After a short while, he suddenly smiled and said, “You’re right. Dao Companions should go through life and death together. I shouldn’t have forced my opinion upon you. That’s very unfair to you. Even though it’s for your own good, you have the right to make your own choice. I shouldn’t have taken that from you!”

The reason he’d changed his decision was mostly because that extraordinary expert, Xiao Yuxi’s father, would be following him back to the southern territory. So, how could Xiao Yuxi suffer any harm while Xiao Tianji was there!?

Just like that, the two of them held each other in their arms until the sun had set.

Suddenly, Xiao Yuxi released her grip on Yang Ye while her expression returned to normal. Yang Ye wasn’t surprised by this because Ye Yun had arrived.

“Are all our brothers ready?” asked Yang Ye. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Ye Yun nodded and said, “They’ve all left Ancient Domain City and are hiding outside the city. Sword Master, you only have to give the word, and we’ll immediately set out and kill our way back to the southern territory.”

Yang Ye nodded and said, “How has the southern territory been lately?”

“Undercurrents are brewing!” Ye Yun said in a low voice, “Even though it’s calm on the surface, but undercurrents are brewing in the shadows. The Sword Sect has already started to summon its disciples back from the outside world, so it might be making a huge move soon. However, we don’t know the specifics. After the Sword Sect summoned its disciples back, the Ghost Sect, Flower Palace, Origin School, Brightmoon Sect, and Snow Palace started doing the same as well. Something worthy of mentioning is that the Marquises of the nine states have led their elite troops towards the capital as well. In short, undercurrents are brewing throughout the southern territory, and it seems like something huge is about to occur!”

“Is chaos about to break out? The more chaotic the better....” Yang Ye said, “Continue dispatching our members to pay close attention to the southern territory!”

“Yes!”

Yang Ye suddenly asked. “Right, is Luo Feng dead?”

Ye Yun shook his head and said, “Brother Li failed to assassinate him!”

“Why?” Yang Ye frowned.

Ye Yun said, “Luo Feng’s strength was extremely formidable, and he was able to summon flying Darkbeasts!”

So that was the reason! Yang Ye nodded and said, “Forget it. Pay no further attention to him. Tell our brothers to rest well and recover to their peak states because it won’t be long before we might face a bloody war!”

“Yes!” Ye Yun vanished on the spot right after he spoke this word.

Yang Ye flipped his palm after Ye Yun left, and then Luo Feng’s spatial ring appeared in his hand. Yang Ye’s expression instantly became weird when he saw the contents of the spatial ring.

There were very few things in the spatial ring. To be more precise, there was almost nothing. There were some energy stones, but they amounted to less than 20,000. Besides that... besides that, all that remained was women’s lingerie in a variety of colors.... There were a few tens of thousands of them. Moreover, there were over 10,000 albums of erotica, and a huge amount of small blue colored bottles labeled ‘Timber’, ‘Good Girl Bad Girl’....

Yang Ye shook his head before he flicked the spatial ring into the ground. He wasn’t a pervert, so he naturally had no interest in those women’s clothes.

Right at this moment, the ground below the combat arena suddenly trembled lightly. Yang Ye was delighted when he noticed this, and he didn’t hesitate to grab Xiao Yuxi’s hand before he shot swiftly towards the ground.

His thirst for the treasures gathered by the white dragon was intolerable!
