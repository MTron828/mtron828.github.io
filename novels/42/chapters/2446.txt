Chapter 2447 – The Desolate Race is Heartless, so Assist Me! World!

Yang Ye really couldn’t bear to continue watching!

Losing wasn’t shameful, being unable to accept it was shameful!

Huang Cangyue clearly couldn’t accept her defeat!

Huang Cangyue was exasperated from being insulted by Yang Ye, and she cursed, “Who do you think you are? You…”

Suddenly, Yang Ye kicked her stomach.

Bang!

Huang Cangyue flew over 1km away.

Yang Ye hadn’t held back at all, so the sharp pain of it caused her face to warp.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye appeared in front of her again.

Huang Ying hesitated for a moment and was about to speak, but Sky Lord stopped him.

Huang Ying gazed at Sky Lord with bewilderment, and the latter spoke softly, “She has talent, but she’s too proud. If that pride of hers isn’t destroyed, she’ll become mediocre in the future.”

Huang Ying nodded and didn’t say anything else.

Yang Ye ridiculed while standing by Huang Cangyue’s side, “The Barbarian Physique? Is that the source of your pride? Tell me, what else do you have besides that?”

Huang Cangyue glared at him, and it was like her eyes could spew flames!

Yang Ye looked down at her and said, “Do you know what’s the difference between the two of you? It’s that even if she loses the Martial God Physique, she’s still the same person! Her strength doesn’t come solely from her physique, it comes from her heart and will. But take a look at yourself! You give in to despair from the slightest setback, and you can’t even realize the truth of things. Without the desolate race there to protect you, trash like you would probably die in the outside world before you even know what killed you!”

Yang Ye turned around and walked over to Huang Ying, “Brother Huang Ying, let’s get back to business!”

Huang Ying nodded and entered the hall with Yang Ye and A’Leng.

Only Sky Lord and Huang Cangyue remained here.

A long time passed before Huang Cangyue closed her eyes slowly, and then another long while passed before she suddenly said, “She’s truly strong!”

Truly strong!

When she recalled the previous battle, Huang Cangyue realized that she wasn’t on the same level as An Nanjing.

Sky Lord spoke softly, “The gap in strength between you and her isn’t very huge, but do you know why you lost in an instant?”

Huang Cangyue gazed at him.

He explained softly, “It’s mainly because of your mental state and your combat instinct. Your mental state is 80% of the reason. When you failed to defeat her with an attack that carried your full strength, your heart started to shake. Or to be more precise, you started to panic. Once that happens, your mind falls into chaos. As for her, her mental state remained the same throughout the battle.”

Huang Cangyue fell silent for a long time, “What would my chances of winning be if I didn’t panic?”

Sky Lord shook his head, “Her attainments in the Martial Dao are a level higher than you, and her combat instinct isn’t inferior to even the strongest Deathguard of our race. You must remember that the Barbarian Physique isn’t someone you should take pride in, it is a burden. You must treat it as a burden. Just as Yang Ye said, think about it. What do you have if you lose the Barbaric Physique and Barbaric Energy?”

Huang Cangyue’s hands trembled while her face turned ghastly pale!

Sky Lord asked, “Do you know why we do not seize the Sprite Progenitor when we know that he has it?”

She shook her head.

Sky Lord smiled, “Because we never entrust our hopes on someone else. We rely on ourselves, for everything! Moreover, Eternal Kingdom wants to kill him and take the Sprite Progenitor, and doing so undoubtedly makes them mortal enemies. My enemy’s enemy is my friend. Our desolate race is willing to become his friend. As for the Sprite Progenitor, do you think Yang Ye would take the Eternal Kingdom’s side?”

Huang Cangyue spoke seriously, “Isn’t it better to have the Sprite Progenitor under our control? Yang Ye and her may be extraordinary geniuses, but they don’t belong to our desolate race, right?”

The Sky Lord smiled, “He has backing!”

Backing!

Huang Cangyue frowned and wanted to ask about it, but Sky Lord shook his head, “Once you’ve recovered, come to Deathguard Camp. It’ll be good for you!”

He vanished on the spot.Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Huang Cangyue spoke softly, “No wonder…”

If Yang Ye didn’t have any backing, it was obvious that the desolate race would never give up on obtaining the Sprite Progenitor just for Yang Ye! Yang Ye’s strength was formidable, but it was far insufficient to go against the entire desolate race!

So, here lied the problem. Who was backing Yang Ye? Because that person was actually able to make the desolate race make a compromise, give up the Sprite Progenitor, and become friends with Yang Ye!

…

Once they entered the hall, an old man with a saber scar on his face was standing in the air above.

Huang Ying bowed slightly to the old man, “Grand Elder!”

Huang Ying had a very respectful expression on his face.

Grand Elder!

The status of the old man before them was merely inferior to the patriarch. Just like Sky Lord, he only obeyed the patriarch. Moreover, the Grand Elder was the leader of all elders, and his level was even higher than the Heavenly Exalt, Earthly Exalt, and Mortal Exalt!

The Grand Elder glanced at Huang Ying, nodded slightly, and then gazed at Yang Ye, “Can you let me see her?”

He was naturally referring to Snowy!

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and nodded, and then he summoned Snowy. Snowy glanced at the surroundings once she came outside, and then she shook her head and went back into the Primordial Pagoda when she didn’t detect any treasures!

Yang Ye was stunned speechless by this.

“The Sprite Progenitor…” Meanwhile, the Grand Elder spoke softly, “It really is the Sprite Progenitor!”

A wisp of complicated emotions flashed through his eyes at this point.

The desolate race’s defeat all those years ago could be attributed entirely to the Sprite Progenitor. Now that he saw a Sprite Progenitor again, it naturally aroused complicated emotions in him.

Did he hate Sprite Progenitors?”

Actually, if he were to be honest, he didn’t really hate Sprite Progenitors. All those years ago, the desolate race had gone too far when it came to some things. Especially when they slaughtered the sprites of Eternal Kingdom. Actually, many within the desolate race didn’t support such actions. Unfortunately, that person, the patriarch’s own younger brother, had acted willfully and insisted on it. In the end, it made the Sprite Progenitor join the war!

He’d witnessed the Sprite Progenitor in action all those years ago. That Sprite Progenitor had merely said something toward the world, and just that caused the desolate race to lose a winning war!

The old man shook his head slightly and restrained his thoughts before looking at Huang Ying. He flicked a violet command token over and said, “From this moment onward, you’re the desolate race’s Crown Prince. Besides the Five World Realm experts of our desolate race, you can give orders to everyone else. Besides that, while Five World Realm experts are not under your command, we cannot interfere with your decisions either.”

The old man vanished on the spot once he finished speaking.

The Crown Prince!

Huang Ying glanced at the command token and fell silent.

A’Leng suddenly smiled, “Congratulations!”

Huang Ying laughed bitterly, “You know… I really yearned for this command token before I got it. But now that I have, it feels so heavy to me!”

Heavy!

While the position of Crown Prince gave him a lot of authority, he had a lot of responsibilities on his shoulders too!

A'Leng said, “It’s normal for responsibilities to be heavy.”

Huang Ying smiled, “Alright, forget that. Brother Yang, Miss A’Leng, my desolate race has a Martial Pavilion and Dao Pavilion. In the Martial Pavilion, there are books on all sorts of techniques that my desolate race has gathered for many years. As for the Dao Pavilion, it contains the comprehensions of my desolate race’s ancestors. Amongst them are numerous powerful secret techniques that are considered precious treasures in my desolate race. Are you interested in having a look?”

They exchanged glances and nodded!

Only a fool would refuse that!

Huang Ying chuckled. He was about to speak when Yang Ye suddenly asked, “Do you have records on the war from all those years ago?” Yang Ye was quite curious about that war.

Huang Ying nodded, “If you’re interested, I can take you to a place first. You’ll be able to witness the war there.”

A’Leng suddenly said, “Your desolate race recorded it?”

Huang Ying nodded, “Our patriarch said that failure is not terrifying, what’s terrifying is the inability to face failure. We lost all those years ago, so he used a supreme technique to reproduce some of the scenes from that war so that the later generations would be able to see it for themselves.”

Yang Ye nodded, “That’s perfect!”

Huang Ying nodded and led the two of them out of the hall. It didn’t take long for him to bring them to a pond. In the pond was crystal clear water and nothing else!

Huang Ying walked to the side of it and tapped his finger forward. Four Eternal Divine Crystals dropped into the pillars on each corner of the pond, and then the water within it started to ripple.

The water suddenly shot up and formed a screen of water before them. Within it was a huge world.

A’Leng’s eyes narrowed slightly from the sight of the world.

It was Eternal Kingdom!

It started off being quite blurry, but after Huang Ying tossed in a few more Eternal Divine Crystals, it grew more and more clearer.

Eternal Kingdom!

But it was in a mess!

Corpses, blood, and severed limbs filled the entire world! And Eternal Kingdom itself was covered in the flames of war!

Suddenly, Yang Ye’s pupils constricted. A woman in a white dress appeared in the sky above Eternal Kingdom.

The Sprite Progenitor!

It was the Sprite Progenitor Yang Ye met in the Primal Battlefield.

The Sprite Progenitor glanced at the surroundings. Besides the corpses of humans and demons, there were many corpses of sprites too!

Meanwhile, a middle aged man with red hair was carrying out an insane slaughter not too far away from the woman in a white dress. The red-haired middle aged man wasn’t just slaughtering humans and some demons, he was slaughtering sprites too. All of those sprites had been captured!

Slaughter intent!

Yang Ye’s gaze descended onto the middle aged man, and the man was emanating extremely thick and powerful slaughter intent!

The middle aged man killed as he roared, “Kill! Kill everything in Eternal Kingdom! Hahaha!”

The woman’s gaze gradually turned icy cold. Suddenly, she took a step forward, “The desolate race is heartless, so assist me! World!”

In an instant…
