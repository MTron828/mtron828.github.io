Chapter 2622

Help!

Tian Xiu remained indifferent.

She was determined to destroy this world!

Yang Ye, Erya, and the others were determined to do the same too!

The entire Origin World’s core was starting to suffer damage. Because as Erya ceaselessly hammered the bridge, the Boundless Water below had started to surge. Besides that, Yang Ye’s slaughter intent and Slaughter Domain left a river of blood wherever it passed!

Slaughter!

If Yang Ye’s sword intent could be considered to be pure sword intent and a pure Sword Heart, then now he possessed pure slaughter intent, and a pure Heart of Slaughter!

Releasing it represented not suppressing it, and that represented that his slaughter intent and desire to kill would be absolutely powerful!

Monstrous slaughter intent surged through the Origin World while more and more were corrupted by slaughter intent. In the end, they started to go mad killing each other!

As for those Destiny Realm experts in battle against Yang Ye, they didn’t dare to get close to him and could only keep their distance.

Because once they got close, they wouldn’t be able to resist the slaughter intent within Yang Ye’s Slaughter Domain!

Unless they focused on resisting it and didn’t distract themselves by fighting with Yang Ye!

But was that even possible?

As for the Desolate Emperor, he’d been watching for the very beginning. Even now, he was still just watching!

Tian Xiu stood in the air with Snowy, but her gaze frequently descended upon Yang Ye.

Yang Ye was very unstable right now, so she had to pay attention to him at all times.

As for Xuan Lin, he didn’t dare to do anything while she didn’t do anything.

Tian Xiu was someone from this era. While she wasn’t as ancient or mysterious as Qi Bitian, she was one of the most outstanding people in this world, just like the Desolate Emperor.

Even peak Destiny Realm experts didn’t dare to say that they were absolutely confident in being able to defeat her in single combat!

As for how strong she really was, it was a mystery.

Qi Bitian and the Desolate Emperor were the same, their strength was a mystery as well!

A huge mystery!

It could be said that no matter how this incident ended, the Origin World would suffer a terrible, terrible loss.

Because its overall strength would drop by at least 50% after this battle! Of course, if worse came to worse, then the Origin World would vanish completely!

However, as far as Xuan Lin was concerned, that was impossible!

It was a place linked to that mysterious place!

Of course, he was most worried about the battle between Qi Bitian and the others!

That was the key to everything!

If those experts couldn’t suppress Qi Bitian, then they would truly be hurled into despair. However, he felt that wouldn’t happen. After all, even that mysterious expert had stepped forward…

Too many mysterious experts had shown themselves this time!

Suddenly, Tian Xiu’s eyes narrowed slightly.

Yang Ye’s Slaughter Domain and slaughter intent were suddenly suppressed by a wave of mysterious energy.

Meanwhile, it seemed like a mountain had pressed down upon Erya, causing her to be unable to swing her fists anymore.

A hunched old man appeared not too far away from Tian Xiu.

The old man wore a very, very old robe that had lost its original color. He was very old and his face was covered in wrinkles, white spots, and black spots. Besides that, he had a pitiable amount of hair left. Only a few were left above his head. He was wearing a pair of straw sandals.

The old man glanced at Yang Ye and frowned slightly, and then he moved his gaze to Erya. There was a trace of solemness in his eyes. After that, he looked up at Qi Bitian’s figure in the sky!

He sighed softly upon seeing her, “Abyss Lord, it would have never sensed you if you just stayed there. Now that you’ve shown yourself, even if we don’t kill you, the heavens will!”

He shook his head and gazed at Tian Xiu, and there was a trace of complicated emotions in his eyes, “There are outstanding experts in every generation. The Desolate Emperor and you are undoubtedly the best in this era.”

The Desolate Emperor smiled, “Thanks for the compliment!”

The old man glanced at him and said, “You have great ambition.”

The Desolate Emperor smiled, “It can’t be helped, the stronger you get, the greater your ambition grows. It’s human nature.”

The old man took a deep and long glance at the Desolate Emperor, and then he said, “We should have taken action and killed you before you grew completely. Unfortunately, we were concerned about too many things and missed the chance to do that!”

The Desolate Emperor smiled, “Then I’ll thank you for not killing me.”

The old man ignored the Desolate Emperor and gazed at Tian Xiu, “The Origin World is linked to that place, and it’s the only place we can stay. So, can you show mercy? Of course, if you agree, then all of you, even the Sprite Progenitor, can leave safely. Besides that, the Origin World won’t interfere in the Eternal Kingdom and Sprite Progenitor’s business.”

He wanted them to stop!

Obviously, the old man didn’t really want to fight.

Because it was meaningless!

Actually, fighting didn’t benefit him at all. That place didn’t really want to interfere in the conflict between these two parties. If Tian Xiu and the others weren’t trying to destroy this world, he wouldn’t even interfere in this nonsense.

It was a pain!

Tian Xiu shook her head, “You want us to stop? Of course we can. Just help us deal with all the powers and people of this world, and we can spare this world from destruction. Alright?”

Kill everyone in this world!

The old man grinned, “Looks like we can’t come to an agreement. But it’s normal because I never expected us to come to an agreement. Since you’re all so confident and want to fight, then let’s fight!”

The old man closed his eyes slowly.

Hiss!

It sounded like something had been torn apart, and then strands of mysterious energy appeared around Tian Xiu!

It was energy invisible to the eye!

Tian Xiu could see them, or to be more precise, she could sense it!

It was conviction!

It was like the attack An Nanjing could unleash with her conviction. Of course, the old man’s attainments were much greater than An Nanjing, and even that master of An Nanjing’s was no match for the old man.

The conviction instantly arrived before Tian Xiu!

If it was any other ordinary Destiny Realm expert, that person would be instantly killed by this!

It was too powerful!

Unfortunately, the old man was facing Tian Xiu, the most outstanding expert of the void race.

Tian Xiu raised her right hand slowly, and then strands of dark light rippled out of her palm.

Every strand of light contained the Laws of the Grand Dao!

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!

Numerous sharp tearing sounds resounded.

The space around Tian Xiu and the old man collapsed inch by inch.

Suddenly, Tian Xiu closed her eyes and said, “Ruin!”

As soon as she said that, the old man started to move backward incessantly while faint flames appeared around him. The flames started small, but they gradually grew stronger and stronger.

“Grand Dao Truths!” The old man frowned while a solemn expression appeared in his eyes, “You’ve actually grasped such power!”

As soon as he finished speaking, the old man turned ethereal. An instant later, the flames started to die down.

The Desolate Emperor suddenly smiled, “Patriarch Xiu, he is from the era which even Destiny feared. If you don’t fight a little more seriously, you won’t be able to kill him.”

Suddenly, a saber appeared before Tian Xiu!

A saber that had just appeared out of nowhere!

As soon as it appeared, the world around her seemed to freeze. Everything was frozen, and only the saber could move!

It slashed rapidly at Tian Xiu!

It surpassed the boundaries of time and space!

Simply speaking, it was beyond the Three Dimensional Space, and Three Dimensional Space couldn’t suppress it anymore!

Tian Xiu had noticed that too.

Her expression remained calm as she closed her eyes, and then countless strands of dark light surged out from her!

Boom!

The space around her was obliterated!

The Desolate Emperor’s eyes narrowed slightly, “Interesting! I underestimated you a little!”

Tian Xiu had shattered Three Dimensional Space!

Both the saber and Tian Xiu hadn’t entered Four Dimensional Space, but they weren’t in Three Dimensional Space either. Of course, that wasn’t the main point, the main point was that both of them were in the space part of space!

The saber stopped just an inch away from her forehead!

Tian Xiu had clamped down on it with two fingers, and then she swung it to the side.

Hiss!

The saber shot through the air.

But it only took a moment for the saber to stop, and a pale middle aged man stood before it. The middle aged man wore a snowy white robe. He was handsome, and his hair was tied up behind his head.

The middle aged man’s bearing was untainted like a snow lotus high above in the mountains.

The old man from before was on the middle aged man’s right.

The middle aged man glanced at Yang Ye, “Chen Xuanan didn’t possess such slaughter intent all those years ago. Of course, if he possessed such powerful slaughter intent then, then I may not have been a match for him. Even though I’ve never defeated him either. Luckily, I’ve never lost as well. It’s a pity that he’s dead.”

He moved his gaze at Tian Xiu and continued, “Formidable.”

Tian Xiu glanced at the surroundings and said, “Are there more?” Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

The middle aged man shook his head, “I think that even if we can’t kill you, Old Man Lee and I should be able to keep you busy.”

Tian Xiu’s eyes narrowed slightly, “He’s your target.”

The middle aged man nodded, “There’s no rush. We’ll be killing you and her too. We’re just killing off the weaker ones first!”

Hiss! Hiss!

As soon as the man finished speaking, two sounds of something being sliced open resounded as two swords flashed!

They were beyond fast!

Bang! Bang!

A moment later, Yang Ye and An Nanjing were blasted away, and a sword was in each of their chests. These swords carried them over 10km away before nailing them onto the bridge.

Blood sprayed!

An old man had appeared on the bridge, an old man with three swords on his back.

The old man walked slowly in Yang Ye and An Nanjing’s direction, “I’m Gu Jiantian, the second master of the Ancient Sword Sect. Of course, that’s in the past.”

Suddenly, the old man stopped. A fluffy white little fellow had appeared before him.

Snowy!

Snowy glanced at Erya. Erya had been suppressed, and she could discern that Erya was in pain. After that, she glanced at Tian Xiu, and Tian Xiu was being kept busy by three experts. Finally, she gazed at Yang Ye and An Nanjing.

Snowy started crying.

As she cried and cried, Snowy put her paws together, and strands of invisible energy rippled out from her. At the same time, she opened her mouth…

No sound came from her.

She’d said three words.

“World… Assist me…”

Suddenly!
