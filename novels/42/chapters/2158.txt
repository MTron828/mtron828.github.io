Chapter 2159 – Where to Kill?

Endless slaughter intent!

At this moment, Yang Ye’s slaughter intent had instantly risen to his limits!

Sage Realm slaughter intent!

At this moment, the space in a huge area was covered in slaughter intent.

Everyone was shocked by this scene!

An Nanjing frowned in Yang Ye’s arms. Because she sensed that Yang Ye seemed to be on the verge of being unable to control himself. She stretched out her hand to grab his hand, but she grabbed nothing but air.

She suddenly turned around, and Yang Ye was before the Sages of the Buddhist Path.

The Buddhist Path had sent 12 Sages, and they were called the 12 Arhats. They were extremely famous existences in the Buddhist Path, and they were like the nine disciples of the Dao Path.

Sage A’Luo led the ground, and he was the expert who’d taken An Nanjing by surprise earlier.

At this moment, A’Luo had a solemn expression in his eyes.

He’d never seen such strong slaughter intent, and he’d only heard of it.

A’Luo pondered deeply for a moment and said, “Young Master Yang Ye, your slaughter intent is too strong, and you’ve lost your mind. I…”

Suddenly, a ray of sword energy flashed.

A’Luo’s expression changed drastically. He slapped his right hand forward, and a ray of Buddhist light rippled out.

However, it was instantly sliced apart by the sword energy. A moment later, the sword energy arrived before A’Luo. But at this moment, there were golden flames in front of him, and it enveloped Yang Ye’s sword energy. An instant later, Yang Ye’s sword energy had been incinerated completely, but Yang Ye had suddenly appeared behind A’Luo.

A’Luo was astounded, and he knew this was bad. He was about to dodge, but two strands of terrifying energy pressed down upon him.

The Sword Domain and slaughter intent!

The suppression from them made A’Luo’s figure bend down, and a sword stabbed into his back.

Hiss!

A strand of blood sprayed from his chest, and then his body was split into two.

Blood and internal organs sprayed toward the surroundings. But the blood wasn’t able to descend before it converged into Yang Ye.

At this moment, everyone here had an extremely solemn expression on their faces.

Their gazes were on Yang Ye. At this moment, his entire body was blood red, especially his hair, it simply seemed like it was made from blood itself. As for his eyes, they seemed like oceans of blood.

Yang Ye’s own slaughter intent was always quite strong, so with the boost provided by the Soulblood Pearl, his slaughter intent had arrived at his limits.

Presently, there was only a single thought in his mind, and it was to kill!

Yang Ye gazed at the remaining 11 Sages from the Buddhist Path, and they had already surrounded him. The Buddhist Path had lost a Sage just like that, so the Buddhist Path would naturally not let the matter rest.

At this moment, Yang Ye’s strength had risen tremendously indeed, but so what?

Why would the Buddhist Path fear him?

Suddenly, Yang Ye stomped his right foot down, and the starry sky cracked apart. At the same time, he arrived behind one of the Sages.

“Watch out!” The Sovereign of Sky shouted with fury and was about to help, but Elysium suddenly shot through the sky in his direction.

An Nanjing had acted!

The Sovereign of Sky stared at An Nanjing, “Do you realize that the Buddhist Path won’t let the matter rest if he kills the Sages of the Buddhist Path like this? At that time, he…”

An Nanjing suddenly interrupted him, “Since he wants to kill them, then he can kill as he pleases!”

The Sovereign of Sky was stunned speechless.

Meanwhile, An Nanjing stopped wasting her breath. She grabbed Elysium and charged at the Sovereign of Sky’s group. Meanwhile, Yang Ye had killed another Sage of the Buddhist Path! However, he’d paid a price for that.

His entire body had cracked open!

He’d taken an injury in order to kill that Sage!

While he’d been heavily injured, it didn’t take long for him to recover. After all, he had the Primordial Violet Energy.

After he killed another Sage in an instant, Yang Ye gazed at his next target. The expression of that Sage from the Buddhist Path changed, and he immediately moved over 3km away. However, Yang Ye still appeared behind him. Right when Yang Ye appeared behind him, around nine rays of golden light slammed against his back, but Yang Ye’s sword had still stabbed into that Sage’s back.

Bang!

Hiss!

Yang Ye was blasted away, but the body of that Sage was split into two as well.

As soon as he stopped himself, nine Sages of the Buddhist Path surrounded him, and then a golden formation of light appeared around him. An instant later, rays of golden light surged out from the formation and enveloped him.

Suddenly, a wave of mysterious energy appeared here.

The Sword Domain!

.

As soon as the Sword Domain appeared here, the golden light in the surroundings instantly stopped like they’d been frozen.

After that, a sword howl surged upward. In an instant, the golden light was obliterated, and then a ray of blood red sword energy tore through space and slammed down at those nine remaining Sages from the Buddhist Path.

Those Sages stood side by side, pressed their palms together, and then slapped them forward at the same time.

Bang!

Yang Ye’s sword energy was obliterated before it could even get close to them!

They didn’t stop and attacked again. In an instant, nine golden palms overlapped and shot toward Yang Ye. The powerful energy they carried caused the space here to turn ethereal.

Moreover, they were even jointly suppressing it. If they didn’t suppress the energy within those attacks, this expanse of the starry sky would have exploded in an instant. As for why they were suppressing it, it was naturally not to prevent the surroundings from being destroyed, it was because they wanted to converge all the energy within their attacks onto Yang Ye. So, Yang Ye was in trouble now. Those palms hadn’t even gotten close to him, yet he felt like he was about to explode apart.

However, he didn’t think so much at this moment. At this moment, all he wanted to do was kill!

He purely wanted to kill!

But he had no choice but to resist the nine palms before him!

Boom!

A wave of slaughter intent swept out from within him, and then it slammed against those palms. At the same time, a ray of sword energy followed behind the slaughter intent.

Yang Ye’s figure was within the sword energy!

Bang!

As soon as their attacks came into contact with each other, Yang Ye’s slaughter intent exploded apart, but the sword energy had arrived. The sword energy slashed apart the nine palms, and then Yang Ye appeared behind one of those Sages. That Sage was horrified when he sensed Yang Ye behind himself, and a thought arose in his mind.

I’m dead!

Sure enough, as soon as that thought arose in his mind, a sword had stabbed through him!

Bang! Bang!

Meanwhile, numerous golden palms slammed against Yang Ye’s back and blasted him away again. As soon as he stopped, countless strands of blood sprayed from his entire body. Blood was spraying like a fountain from him!

Even though his body was at the Sage Realm, he couldn’t endure such an amount of beating! Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Fortunately, his Primordial Violet Energy was ceaselessly repairing his body. Otherwise, his body would have shattered by now!

High above.

Two old men were still in confrontation, and it was the Dao Progenitor and Buddhist Progenitor!

The Buddhist Progenitor glanced at the battle below and gazed at the Dao Progenitor, “Brother Dao, if this continues, a few of those eight remaining Sages of my Buddhist Path will be lost, and that new disciple of yours will probably die here too. Let’s put a stop to it now, alright?”

He’d been keeping the Dao Progenitor busy earlier, but once Yang Ye and An Nanjing started their slaughter, their roles had been reversed!

Otherwise, he would have stopped the battle as soon as Yang Ye had killed that first Sage from the Buddhist Path!

The Dao Progenitor grinned, “I’m afraid it’s not that easy.”

The Buddhist Progenitor glanced at the Dao Progenitor. He was about to speak when he suddenly looked down again.

Meanwhile, after those Sages from the Buddhist Path repulsed Yang Ye, they intended to attack again, but seven mysterious figures in black robes had suddenly appeared here. Or to be more precise, they had appeared behind those Sages from the Buddhist Path. A moment later, rays of cold light surged incessantly.

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!

The Sages from the Buddhist Path were caught off guard, and a few of them lost their heads. At this moment, only two Sages from the Buddhist Path remained. They’d dodged that lethal attack at the last moment!

Another organization had joined the battle!

The Buddhist Progenitor slowly closed his eyes, “The god race!”

“Correct!” Suddenly, a woman appeared. It was Ding Shaoyao. She glanced at the Dao Progenitor, and then she gazed at the Buddhist Progenitor, “Looks like all of you’ve forgotten us since we haven’t done anything for some time.”

The Dao Progenitor gazed at Ding Shaoyao, “Why?”

“Why?” She grinned, “Buddhist Progenitor, you became my god race’s enemy the minute you took the Alliance of All’s side. Since you’re our enemy, we’ll naturally take revenge on you. We didn’t have a chance earlier, but we have a very good chance right now, right?”

The Buddhist Progenitor gazed at her in silence.

“You want to kill me?” She grinned, “You’ll have to see if the Dao Progenitor will allow that!”

The Buddhist Progenitor gazed at the Dao Progenitor, “Brother Dao, have you joined forces with the god race?”

The Dao Progenitor shook his head, “Not at all. However, if you try to kill her now, then I may have to help her. Otherwise, that kid will blame me once he regains consciousness.”

The Buddhist Progenitor glanced at them and said, “You’ve won this time.”

He was about to speak more, but he suddenly looked toward the west, and then he vanished on the spot.

…

The Buddhist Dimension.

At this moment, there was an unwelcome guest here, a middle aged man with no arms.

The armless man glanced at the surroundings and said, “Where should I start killing from?”
