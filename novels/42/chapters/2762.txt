Chapter 2763 – Kill Them All!

The battle was still going on in this area of outer space.

Tu, Yang Busi, Tian Xiu, and Qi Bitian had actually joined forces.

All of them had a single objective, to stop these towering giants and the man from entering the Three Dimensional Universe.

As far as Qi Bitian and Tian Xiu were concerned, Destiny was an enemy, but these fellows before them were enemies too.

In the beginning, they fully suppressed the man and those giants.

Or to be more precise, the man and those giants were practically only able to defend themselves.

Their joint forces were truly too terrifying!

But it didn’t take long for Tu and the others to suddenly stop.

They practically simultaneously gazed at the expanse of space behind the man and the giants. There seemed to be something coming from there, and the space there was rippling.

A moment later, four huge demons emerged from that expanse of space.

They were like wolves with ferocious appearances, and extremely long fangs. Their bodies were huge like rocs, and they even had wings on their backs. Their limbs were monstrous like mountains!

“Pantheras!” Tu spoke abruptly.

Qi Bitian gazed at Tu, but Tu looked up at the endless starry sky above, and there was confusion in her eyes, “What are you trying to do?”

No one else here had a better idea of how terrifying these demon beasts were!

Because she’d fought them in the past. All those years ago, her strongest form had personally suppressed that extraordinary expert of the Four Dimensional Universe. Besides that, she’d slaughtered many extraordinary experts of the Four Dimensional Universe. The Panthera were one of them!

Moreover, because of her strongest form, the Four Dimensional Universe didn’t dare to send experts that surpassed the Destiny Realm. Because every one they sent would be killed!

Yet now, four had actually appeared simultaneously!

Tu was very puzzled!

Qi Bitian asked, “What the heck are they?”

Obviously, Qi Bitian, Tian Xiu, and Yang Busi had sensed how strong those beasts were.

Tu glanced at Qi Bitian and said, “Don’t let these animals get to the Three Dimensional Universe. Otherwise, everyone there will die.”

Suddenly, the four beasts emanated four monstrous auras toward the woman. Moreover, even the space in a huge area was instantly obliterated!

At this moment, all four of them revealed solemn expressions on their faces.

Tian Xiu suddenly said, “Kill them!”

Qi Bitian smiled, “Let’s see who kills one first!”

As soon as she said that, all four of them practically instantly vanished on the spot.

Meanwhile, the man and the giants didn’t interfere. They just swiftly vanished from here.

At this moment, Tu and the others didn’t have the strength to get distracted and stop the man’s group!

Just like that, the man led the giants swiftly toward the Three Dimensional Universe.

Universe City.

On the Ascension Platform in the Primordial Pagoda.

A little fellow was hammering something.

The little fellow was Snowy, of course.

A long time passed before she suddenly tossed away the Sprite Staff, then she picked up the thing before her and ran off somewhere. A short while later, she arrived at the cultivation room, and she raised a pair of dark golden bracers to Yang Ye.

Heavenshield!

Yang Ye gazed at it and was quite surprised because it wasn’t really the same Heavenshield he knew!

It was much stronger!

Yang Ye gazed at Snowy, and she cracked a smile and waved her little paws.

Erya!

Yang Ye understood that the little fellow had asked Erya for more scales! However, she hadn’t asked for them in one go, and she’d given Erya time to grow more. Just like that, she kept asking for more until she gradually finished modifying Heavenshield.

Yang Ye rubbed Snowy’s head and carried her over to Erya’s above. Yang Ye walked over to Erya and spoke softly, “Erya, will losing those scales affect you?”

She shook her head, “It won’t.”

Yang Ye spoke solemnly, “Tell me the truth!”

Erya smiled, “It is the truth. Big Brother Yang, I’m not lying. I would have thrown them away even if Snowy didn’t ask for them.”

Yang Ye was quite puzzled, “Why?”

She replied softly, “My scales are evolving incessantly, and the previous scales will be eliminated after every evolution!”

She lifted up her tail and said, “See?”

Yang Ye gazed at her tail, and he noticed that the scales on it seemed a little different from her previous scales.

Erya said, “So, I let Snowy take those scales because they would be wasted otherwise!”

Snowy hurriedly nodded!

Yang Ye rubbed Snowy’s head and smiled, “I guess I was overthinking then.”

Snowy cracked a smile and rubbed her head against Yang Ye’s palm.

Yang Ye gazed at Erya, “Erya, have you recalled the past?”

She shook her head, “Why would I? I refuse!”

Yang Ye was stunned.

She spoke softly, “Big Brother Yang, I like how things are now, and I don’t like the past. I’m still me, the past me, and the present me. However, I choose my current life.”

Yang Ye smiled, “I understand!”

Suddenly, Yang Ye’s expression changed, and then he vanished on the spot.

Erya looked up and spoke softly, “Snowy, trouble is here!”

Snowy blinked, and then her eyes spun about. Now one knew what she was thinking.

Erya rubbed Snowy’s head, “Are you planning something?”

Snowy blinked, raised a single claw, and drew a circle. After that, she raised another claw and drew another circle. Just like that, she kept drawing numerous circles.

Erya gazed at the excitement on Snowy’s face and sighed softly, “My goodness, I suddenly feel that Big Brother Yang is truly amazing. He is actually able to understand you, Snowy! I truly admire him!”

Snowy was at a loss for words.

Outside the Primordial Pagoda.

Once he left the Primordial Pagoda, Yang Ye immediately gathered all the experts in the city, and then numerous powerful auras suddenly shot up into the air from within the city.

In the sky above the city, Yang Ye and the others looked up into outer space. Numerous waves of pressure were pressing down from above, and the clouds above the city had been fully dispersed.

At this moment, everyone in the city sensed a wave of lethal pressure!

Yang Ye glanced at the city below before looking up into space. A moment later, he pressed his fingers together and tapped upward.

A ray of sword energy shot up into the air, and it was like a bolt of lightning that instantly obliterated the pressure coming from outer space!

Countless cultivators throughout the city felt like a burden had been lifted from their shoulders.

Yang Ye gazed into outer space. A short while later, a man on a demon beast appeared within their fields of vision.

Behind the demon beast was around 20 giants.

Jian Wudi and the others instantly revealed solemn expressions from the sight of this.

They had sensed the auras of those giants, and they were stronger than them!

Of course, their gazes had converged on the man.

Because the man was a human!

A human from the Three Dimensional Universe!

The man sized up Yang Ye’s group, and then he shook his head and laughed coldly, “After so many years, the Three Dimensional Universe has really been declining with every era.”𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Yang Ye suddenly appeared around 30m before the man.

The man’s eyes narrowed slightly but he didn’t attack.

Confidence!

he had the right to be this confident!

Yang Ye cupped his fist and smiled, “May I know your name?”

The man smiled, “Jiang Jun. Of course, you’ve definitely never heard of me, nor do you have the right to.”

Yang Ye grinned, “I see, Senior Jiang. I wonder why you’re here today, Senior Jiang?”

Jiang Jun spoke indifferently, “Why do you think I’m here? Why would you ask such a stupid question? Don’t you think that asking that makes you seem…”

Suddenly, something unexpected occurred.

Yang Ye, who was still smiling just a moment ago, suddenly appeared right in front of Jiang Jun. The explosive force in that instant caused space to be obliterated in his wake. At the same time, a sword descended toward Jiang Jun’s head!

Explosive Heavenrend!

The explosive force of this attack and Yang Ye’s own strength was sufficient to blast the world apart.

As for Jiang Jun, Yang Ye’s attack was simply a calamity.

Because Yang Ye had taken him by surprise!

In battle, the initiative in the battle was very important!

However, Jiang Jun was no ordinary expert. At the critical moment between life and death, he reacted instinctively!

He instinctively grabbed his spear and raised it before him!

At the same time, a wave of powerful energy surged out from him.

However, it was instantly obliterated by the energy within Yang Ye’s sword, and the sword slashed down.

Hiss!

The sword instantly sliced through the spear. But the instant of time the spear bought him was enough for Jiang Jun to shoot backward.

However, it was still a little too late!

Hiss!

Blood sprayed and Jiang Jun’s body was instantly slashed into half. However, his soul managed to escape over 1km away.

Yang Ye was about to give chase, but a demon beast appeared in front of him.

The demon beast slammed its paw at Yang Ye!

Yang Ye was about to swing his sword when a petite figure suddenly slammed against the demon beast.

Bang!

The demon beast was blasted away!

It was Erya!

Yang Ye sheathed his sword and gazed at Jiang Jun, “Destiny refuses to protect this world, but I, Yang Ye, will do it!”

As he spoke, he looked up into outer space, “Destiny, I know you’re watching. Just watch and see if I can protect this world.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye suddenly drew his sword, “Kill them! Kill them all!”
