Chapter 1679 - I’m Not Afraid Of You!

Amongst the eight clans, the Yang Clan’s fight for succession was the most brutal.

It was like how venomous insects were grown. They were made to kill each other, and only the survivors would be kept.

Even though it was brutal, it was extremely effective. Because the successor born from this would be extremely outstanding in all aspects. The main factor that decides whether a clan continues to exist or falls into decline is its leader!

If its leader is useless, then the clan will definitely decline!

Moreover, in overall, the benefits outweighed the costs when utilizing such a method to choose the successor. Because even if the Yang Clan didn’t use such a method, the young masters would still fight each other, and their fights in secret would definitely be even more serious.

Since that was the case, the Yang Clan preferred to allow its young masters to fight openly. Because it would be under the supervision of the Yang Clan’s higher-ups, and it would be within their control.

At the moment that mysterious voice announced the beginning of the competition, the entire city suddenly fell silent.

It was the calm before the storm.

But it didn’t take long for the silence to be broken.

Because the Yang Clan’s fifth young master, Yang Lin; the third young master, Yang Yun; and the sixth young master, Yang Mo, had announced their withdrawal from the competition.

One could choose to withdraw from the fight for succession, but the price of doing so was quite huge. Because once one chose to withdraw, that person would have to leave the Yang Clan. To put it simply, they would be sent away; or to put it more bluntly, they would be exiled. They would be left to live and die on their own.

The Yang Clan didn’t raise useless trash!

Besides that, it was to prevent them from rebelling to seize power in the future. In short, once the successor was chosen, the Yang Clan would channel all its resources to the successor.

Abandoning the fight for succession represents that those young masters have abandoned their right to obtain the Yang Clan’s resources and support. Because if anything happened to them while they were away from the clan, it was very likely that the Yang Clan would pay no attention to it. However, if something happened to the Yang Clan’s successor… Actually, the successor was normally safe because the experts of the Yang Clan would be there to protect the successor from the shadows.

Of course, the young masters who withdrew were usually aware of the extent of their ability. Trying to fight for it without the ability to do so would be no different than courting death. Being exiled was better than death!

After they withdrew from the competition, only the eldest young master, Yang Jian; the fourth young master, Yang Ru; the seventh young master, Yang Xing; the eighth young master, Yang Tian; the ninth young master, Yang Xian; and the tenth young master, Yang Ye remained!

As the veil of night descended, Phecda City seemed even quieter.

Suddenly, a group of people appeared on the streets.

They were led by a man holding a folding fan. It was the fourth young master of the Yang Clan, Yang Ru. The Lu Clan’s successor, Lu Yuanzhan, was on his left, and an old man in a linen robe was on his right.

There were 17 other black robed cultivators behind the three of them. Based on their auras, all of them were Zenith Realm experts!

It didn’t take long for Yang Ru to stop moving. It was Yang Ye’s abode that stood in front of him.

Lu Yuanzhan suddenly asked, “Brother Yang Ru, why do you insist on killing that fellow, Yang Ye?”

Yang Ru gazed at Yang Ye’s abode for a long time and replied, “I’m not the one who wants to kill him. Others want him dead!”

Lu Yuanzhan’s eyes narrowed slightly, “What do you mean?”

Yang Ru spoke indifferently, “You may not be aware of the identity of this tenth brother of mine. His identity isn’t ordinary at all!”

Lu Yuanzhan replied, “Please do tell!”

Yang Ru explained, “His father was an extraordinarily monstrous genius that’s rare to come by in a thousand years. All those years ago, my Yang Clan was weak, and it was his father who led the clan to the point of being merely inferior to the Ying Clan and on par with the Wu Clan. Unfortunately, something unexpected occurred to his father, causing his father to lose his cultivation, and become a cripple.”

Lu Yuanzhan asked, “What happened after that?”

Yang Ru shook his head slightly, “Even though he lost his cultivation, he was very popular in the clan. So, even if many wished for nothing more than to see him die, none dared to act against him. However, he was still exiled in the end. After he was exiled, all the worlds he conquered for the clan were split up amongst the others. Now, it belongs to the Yang Clan.”

He paused for a moment and continued, “Of course, that’s not all. Based on the forces that his father had gathered at the time, it could be said that he would definitely be the next patriarch. Yet now, the patriarch is someone else… Do you understand what I mean?”

Lu Yuanzhan seemed to have thought of something, and his eyelids twitched slightly, “If that person wanted to kill him, then there would be no need for you to do anything, right?”

Yang Ru chuckled, “If not me, then who? Can he do it himself? Brother Lu, you have to realize that everyone is watching.” He gazed at Yang Ye’s abode and continued, “Actually, it wouldn’t be a problem if he didn’t come back, but he came back.”

Lu Yuanzhan asked, “What do you mean?”

Yang Ru chuckled, “His arrival told my clan something, and it’s that his father is still alive. His father isn’t someone with a good temper. The Yang Clan forced him to leave all those years ago. So, if he recovers his strength and returns to the Yang Clan, then what do you think the first thing he does will be?”

Lu Yuanzhan fell silent.

Yang Ru continued, “Many people hit him when he was down all those years ago. Moreover, many of his father’s trusted subordinates have been dealt with. So, based on his father’s character, if his father returns, then the first thing his father will do is wash the Yang Clan with blood!”

Lu Yuanzhan asked, “Then why kill Yang Ye?”

Yang Ru’s eyes narrowed slightly, “Weeds should be pulled up by the root! Moreover, the natural talent and potential of this tenth brother of ours has aroused fear in the people above us.”

Lu Yuanzhan asked another question, “Then why don’t they just send a True Realm expert to kill him?”

“Do you think they didn’t?” Yang Ru continued, “Unfortunately, they failed. His father still has many loyal subordinates. They’ve gained strength and position in the Yang Clan, so even the Council of Elders, the Discipline Hall, or the patriarch himself dare not act rashly. If they act against him, it may cause the Yang Clan to fall into chaos. So, they have an agreement where True Realm experts aren’t allowed to interfere.”

Lu Yuanzhan nodded, “I understand. But Brother yang Ru, if you kill him, I’m afraid…”

Yang Ru chuckled and said, “If I kill him, many may try to avenge him, right?”

Lu Yuanzhan nodded, “Aren’t you worried about that?”

Yang Ru gazed at Yang Ye’s abode for a long time and said, “I have no choice. I’m not the only one. My eldest brother, ninth brother, fifth brother, and seventh brother have no choice either.”

Lu Yuanzhan gazed at Yang Ru with astonishment, “All of them…”

Yang Ru nodded and gazed at Yang Ye’s abode, “The Yang Clan might split apart if both him and his father aren’t dead. Only their deaths can put an end to the thoughts that some people in the clan are holding and guarantee that the Yang Clan doesn’t fall into internal strife.”

He suddenly chuckled when he spoke up to this point, “You know… our mission isn’t to survive and leave the city, it’s to kill him.” A ferocious smile curled up on the corners of his mouth, “Or I should say that the Yang Clan wants him dead!”

Lu Yuanzhan spoke softly, “His father…”

Yang Ru shook his head slightly, “It’s best if his father doesn’t show himself. If he does, he’ll die as well. My Yang Clan isn’t the only one that doesn’t want to see his father alive. His father offended many in Milky Way System all those years ago!”

As he spoke, he took a step forward and said, “I’ll be the one to take his head!”

As soon as he finished speaking, the folding fan in his grasp transformed into a ray of white light that vanished on the spot.

Swish!

It swished through the air and instantly arrived before Yang Ye’s abode.

Suddenly, a ray of light flashed out from within the abode.

Bang!

An explosion resounded, and then the folding fan flew back into Yang Ru’s grasp. Meanwhile, a ray of light descended not too far in front of Yang Ru, and then it dispersed to reveal Yang Ye’s figure.

Yang Ru sized up Yang Ye and said, “Looks like you’ve grown stronger. Congratulations.”

Yang Ye glanced at Yang Ru and spoke indifferently, “I don’t know why you’re targeting me, but as far as I’m concerned, it isn’t important. If someone wants to kill me, I’ll kill them.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye transformed into a ray of light that vanished on the spot.

Yang Ru waved his right hand, and then folding fan unfolded before a beam of light surged out from it.

Bang!

A rumbling explosion resounded as space shook violently. The beam of light was blasted into bits while the ray of light, which Yang Ye had transformed into, had arrived before Yang Ru.

Yang Ru’s eyes narrowed slightly. He took a step forward, and white light coiled around his finger as he tapped it forward.

As soon as the tip of Yang Ye’s sword came into contact with the tip of Yang Ru’s finger, the space around them shook violently again. At the same time, Yang Ye and Yang Ru moved backwards repeatedly. However, it didn’t take long for Yang Ye to stop himself, and then he stomped his right foot down and transformed into a ray of light that surged forward.

Meanwhile, Yang Ru’s eyes narrowed slightly while his body continued backwards, and he immediately slapped his left palm forward.

Bang!

A terrifying ray of white light sprayed out from his palm. In an instant, Yang Ye was enveloped by the white light, but it only took a moment for a ray of light to tear throughout and stab at Yang Ru.

A cold glow flashed through Yang Ru’s eyes as he flicked his folding fan. It transformed into a ray of white lightning that shot towards Yang Ye.

At the same time, he tapped his foot against the ground and transformed into a beam of light that surged in Yang Ye’s direction.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye held his sword with both hands and swung it forcefully.

Boom!

The folding fan was obliterated in an instant. At the same time, Yang Ye raised his sword and swung it once more!

Boom!

An explosion resounded, and then both Yang Ye and Yang Ru were pushed back repeatedly.

Three breaths of time later, they’d been pushed 300m backwards respectively. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

As soon as his figure stopped moving backwards, a wisp of scarlet red seeped out from the corner of Yang Ru’s mouth. He wiped off the blood and gazed at Yang Ye, “Not only has your strength improved, your physical strength has grown as well. How surprising!”

Yang Ye didn’t waste his breath. He just stomped his right foot down and transformed into a ray of light that shot towards Yang Ru.

Suddenly, Yang Ru waved his right hand. Lu Yuanzhan, the old man in a linen robe, and the other 17 Zenith Rank experts behind him immediately swarmed forward and surrounded Yang Ye.

Bang! Bang!

Numerous explosions resounded, and a figure was blasted almost 10km away.

It was Yang Ye!

Once he stopped himself, Yang Ye gazed at the old man in a linen robe. The old man was a Half-Step True Realm expert!

Meanwhile, Yang Ru laughed coldly, “I’m not going to fight you by myself today! Yang Ye! No matter how extraordinary you are, you’re going to die today!”

As he spoke, he tapped his right foot against the ground and transformed into a ray of white light that shot towards Yang Ye.

At the same time, Lu Yuanzhan and the others followed closely behind him.

A savage smile curled up on the corners of Yang Ye’s mouth, “Ganging up on me? I’m not afraid of you!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he flipped his right hand, and a diagram appeared before him. In an instant, the diagram shook violently and vanished on the spot. After that, the scene in the surroundings transformed into a starry sky.
