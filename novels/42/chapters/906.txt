Chapter 907 – Defend The City!

Translator: InVader

Editor: Conspiracing

The Unfettered One! Yang Ye’s figure trembled slightly when he heard that name, and he turned around to gaze at the dean, “The Unfettered One?”

The dean nodded, “Someone who once reigned supreme over the Central Divine Prefecture. Why? Do you know him?”

Yang Ye shook his head, and then he turned around to look at the painting. At this moment, tempestuous waves were surging through his heart. He hadn’t expected that he would actually be able to hear about the Sword Sect’s Founding Ancestor again after arriving at the Radiant Dimension. Moreover, it seemed like the Unfettered One did very well for himself all those years ago!

Yang Ye asked, “Is he in the Central Divine Prefecture now?”

“He vanished!” The old man gazed at the painting and said, “He vanished after he challenged the number one expert of the Central Divine Prefecture all those years ago. Some say he died while others say he won and went to an even higher plane. However, perhaps only that fellow who fought him all those years ago knows the true answer!”

Yang Ye didn’t speak a word, and he just stared at the painting. There was only a single mountain on the painting, and a river below the mountain. Besides that, there was nothing special about it.

However, Yang Ye’s gaze couldn’t move away once he laid eyes on it. Even he wasn’t able to say why it was like that, but he was instinctively attracted to it!

The dean said, “This painting is something he left behind for his disciple. Later on, his disciple didn’t need it anymore and gave it to me. Right, his disciple’s sword intent attained the Void Rank as well. I don’t know much about the Sword Dao, so I don’t know what secrets this painting holds. However, based on your reaction, I know that it’s definitely useful to sword cultivators like you. Even though I agreed to help you attain Void Rank sword intent, whether you’re able to accomplish it or not depends entirely on yourself!”

Yang Ye asked, “I’m really curious. Why did you ask me to be the instructor for the outer court? Is it really because you want me to represent you and participate in that competition in White Deer Academy?”

The dean walked over to Yang Ye’s side, and there was a trace of sorrow in his eyes as he spoke, “All those years ago, I was a proud genius just like you, and I possessed shocking natural talent as well. Unfortunately, my luck wasn’t as good as yours. I offended someone I couldn’t afford to offend in White Deer Academy, so not only was I exiled to Pine Prefecture, I even caused my master and senior brothers to be dragged down with me.”

Yang Ye asked, “So you want to take revenge?”

The dean shook his head, “The strength of White Deer Academy is beyond your imagination. It’s absolutely impossible to take revenge. Moreover, I don’t want to take revenge. Because I wouldn’t be where I am right now if it wasn’t for the academy. All I want is for those old bastards who exiled me all those years ago to know that my students aren’t inferior to their students. That’s all I desire!”

Yang Ye spoke indifferently, “It sounds like you’ve failed until now!”

The corners of the old man’s mouth twitched slightly, and then he sighed softly, “It isn’t that the students here are weak. All I can say is that those monstrous geniuses in the Central Divine Prefecture are too strong. Not to mention anyone else, but you know of Lou Qianxiao and the other 4 geniuses of our prefecture, right? Do you know that they can only be considered to be not bad in the Central Divine Prefecture? Moreover, White Deer Academy is the number one academy of the Central Divine Prefecture or I should say the number one academy of the Radiance Dimension. So just think about it, how terrifying would the geniuses there be?”

“That’s even more reason for me not to go!” Yang Ye continued, “There are so many monstrous geniuses there and even Innate Saints. If I were to go there with this weak body of mine, then wouldn’t I be like a sheep walking into the mouth of a tiger?”

The corners of the old man’s eyes twitched. A short while passed before he said, “No one is a fool here, so there’s no need to beat around the bust. Just tell me what your conditions are!”

Yang Ye replied, “I’m actually quite curious. There are so many geniuses throughout the prefecture, like Lou Qianxiao and the others. So why have you not chosen them and chosen me instead?”

“Because they aren’t ruthless, bold, and wicked enough!” The old man spoke solemnly, “You don’t know how terrifying those kids from White Deer Academy are. All of them are more ruthless and wicked than wolves. The strengths of many of our past students were actually not bad, but all of them lost. Besides the main reason, which was their strengths, there was one other reason. They weren’t ruthless or insane enough!”

When he spoke up to this point, the old man glanced at Yang Ye and said, “As for you, while your strength is currently inferior to Lou Qianxiao and the others, you absolutely surpass them when it comes to boldness and ruthlessness! As for your strength, it can be improved! Moreover, your strength isn’t much weaker to theirs, and you wouldn’t be weaker to them at all if you can attain Void Rank sword intent! You might even be stronger than them!”

Yang Ye remained silent for a long time before he spoke again, “What can you give me for going?”

The old man pondered deeply for a long time and said, “My academy has 7 Saints. The 7 of us can help you 3 times for free before the competition. After that, if you’re able to obtain the top 3 positions in the competition, then you’ll be the next dean. At that time, besides having all 7 of us as your backing, you can use the resources of the entire academy. Moreover, it won’t affect your position in the Ancient Sword School!”

Yang Ye turned around to gaze at the old man, “Why?”

The old man took a deep breath before he looked up into the sky, “Would you believe me if I said that it was to vent and prove myself?”

Yang Ye gazed at the old man for a short while, and then he said, “Deal!” He had no reason to refuse. After all, the assistance of 7 Saints was exactly what he needed right now. After all, if nothing unexpected happened, then he would definitely enter into conflict with Sky Divine Hall. If the Ancient Sword School refused to lend a hand then, then wouldn’t he be at their mercy then?

Now that he had the old man’s promise, he would at least have no need to fear that the Saints of Sky Divine Hall would bully him when he faced it in the future!

Of course, he knew that the most important thing for him was still to improve his own strength. Because only his own strength was true strength!

There was a smile on the corners of the old man’s mouth when he heard Yang Ye agree, and then he said, “Alright. Since you’ve agreed, then you belong to the academy. Since you belong to the academy, then I won’t hold back. I’m sure you’ve noticed that our academy is facing extreme danger. As a member of the academy, how can you stand by idly, right? There’s no need to observe that painting for now. Just keep it and study it in the future. As for now, quickly head over and help us protect the city....”

“What the fuck!” The corners of Yang Ye’s mouth twitched, “You tricked me!”

The old man grinned, “How can that be considered as tricking you? We’re all members of the academy, so we should help each other in troubled times, right?”

Yang Ye replied, “I’m not the outer court instructor anymore!”

The old man stated, “You’ll be one right away if I say so!”

Yang Ye continued, “I even killed numerous students of the inner court!”

The old man answered, “You’re not being pardoned to protect the city, you’re atoning for your crimes!”

Yang Ye was speechless. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

The old man continued, “Right, those outer court students of yours are quite close to you, huh? All of them have actually knelt before the city gates to ask for your release. Otherwise, they intend to kneel forever!”

A stream of warmth flowed through Yang Ye’s heart when he heard this, and his gaze shot off in the direction of the city.

Meanwhile, the old man continued, “While I’ve promised all of that to you, if you want to obtain the acknowledgement of the academy and take command of it, then you must display some accomplishments. Especially to those 6 old fellows. Only by obtaining their acknowledgement would they willingly assist you. Otherwise, if I were to be gone one day, then not to mention helping you, they might even beat you up because they can’t stand the sight of you!”

Yang Ye pondered deeply for a long while, and then he said, “I encountered someone from Sky Divine Hall on the way here. They’ve joined forces with Welkin Wolf Mountain Range. They even invited me to join Sky Divine Hall!”

The old man stated, “I know!”

Yang Ye was surprised, “You know?”

The old man nodded, “They didn’t hide it. However, they didn’t send any Saints and only helped Welkin Wolf Demon King in secret. The reason they haven’t dispatched Saints is probably because they are waiting for something.”

Yang Ye asked, “Why have they attacked the academy?”

The old man answered, “I know why Welkin Wolf Demon King is attacking the academy. After all, the academy possesses the best Spirit Vein in this area and abundant ore veins of all types. However, Welkin Wolf Mountain Range doesn’t have such ore veins, and its Spirit Vein is about to dry up. So, he has to attack our academy for the sake of his descendants. Otherwise, the Welkin Wolf Clan would vanish from this world if the current situation there continues for long!”

When he spoke up to this point, the old man frowned, “As for Sky Divine Hall, it’s far away in the north. Logically speaking, it has no reason to attack us, but it just so happens to have done so. Moreover, it even joined forces with the demon race. That really puzzles me. After all, the human race and demon race have always been hostile to each other!”

Yang Ye asked, “Do we have backup?”

The old man smiled, “Of course, it’s the Ancient Sword School and the Dao Order. However, the Ancient Sword School and Dao Order won’t act unless Sky Divine Hall attacks. The reason they are helping is naturally because they want to prevent the forces of Sky Divine Hall from entering the south! The territory available to humans here is already insufficient, so how could they tolerate another power that intends to encroach on their territory?”

Yang Ye said, “So the situation isn’t that bad!”

The old man shook his head, “Perhaps it’s worse than your think. Now, only the Welkin Wolf Clan is attacking us, but I dare not guarantee that the other Demon Kings of the south won’t launch a sudden attack. In short, no matter what happens, we have no need to be afraid because our academy isn’t weak!”

Bang!

Suddenly, a huge explosion resounded in the sky, and then numerous wolf howls resounded through the distant sky.

“They’re going to attack the city again!” The old man continued, “Kid, from this moment onward, you’re in charge of the front gates. Don’t let a single demon beast in. If you want to obtain the full support of my academy, then you must contribute to the academy, and not is the moment for you to do that!”

As soon as the old man finished speaking, 6 beams of light shot into the sky from the city. At the same time, the old man transformed into a beam of light that vanished into the sky!

Yang Ye withdrew his gaze, pondered deeply for a moment, and then waved his right hand. He instantly put away the painting which hung on the mountain wall, and then his figure flashed and transformed into a ray of light that vanished into the horizon.

Even if it was only for the sake of Leng Yuran and the others, he still had to head to the city gates!
