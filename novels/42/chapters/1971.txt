Chapter 1972 – The Sword Dao! The Slaughter Dao!

Kill everyone in sight!

Actually, it wasn’t a complicated idea at all.

Amongst the six lines in the Weapon Path, the line Yang Ye inherited focused on slaughter. Slaughter was naturally the act of killing people.

Yang Ye didn’t know that people who just started cultivating the Six Slaughters were usually in a much worse state than he was in. They didn’t just have the desire to kill everyone they saw, they even wanted to kill their loved ones. Of course, those who just started cultivating the Six Slaughters would usually do so in a special place.

The Weapon Path was naturally not a path that was cruel and inhumane!

But because Yang Ye was a sword cultivator who possessed the Enlightened Sword Heart, he was able to maintain his sanity. While he wanted to kill, he wouldn’t just kill anyone he saw!

A’Man glanced at Yang Ye, and she noticed that Yang Ye had his fists clenched and was forcefully keeping himself from attacking.

Meanwhile, the man laughed ferociously, “Didn’t you like to steal? Now…”

The man’s voice stopped abruptly!

Yang Ye had vanished on the spot.

He was in front of the man when he appeared again, and then a sword shot towards the man’s chest!

All four of their expressions changed slightly as they hadn’t expected Yang Ye to just attack abruptly. However, their reaction was extremely swift, and they immediately attacked when Yang Ye did.

“Attack!” A’Man planned to attack once she finished speaking, but the scene before her rendered her stunned on the spot.

Hiss!

A head suddenly flew up into the air, and blood sprayed out like a fountain!

A’Man and Ling had watched as Yang Ye casually sliced off the man’s head.

The man was a Dao Realm expert!

But Yang Ye had taken his head just like that!

Moreover, Yang Ye’s attack seemed like an ordinary swing of the sword, and there was nothing special about it.

After he instantly killed the man, Yang Ye immediately gazed at another one of them, and then he similarly stabbed his sword forward.

This time, A’Man and the others watched carefully.

When Yang Ye’s sword arrived before the man, he was first quite lost, but it didn’t take long for him to react, and his spear swept down at Yang Ye.

They were watching in slow motion!

When Yang Ye’s sword was about to come into contact with the man’s spear, the sword in his grasp suddenly vanished.

Hiss! Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

At the moment Yang Ye’s sword vanished, the man’s body stiffened.

An instant later, his body fell backwards.

Ling asked solemnly, “How did he die?”

A’Man clenched her fists, “He was dead when he swung his spear!”

Ling gazed at her with astonishment, “How can that be possible?”

A’Man shook her head slightly, “It’s inconceivable to me too… His sword contains too much, and I’m only able to see a little of it. However, he clearly hasn’t absorbed it completely. Because his attacks seem quite messy. If he’s able to merge them completely into one, it’ll be even more terrifying!”

She paused for a moment at this point and continued, “Besides his sword, I sense something else. The aura of slaughter he emanated is too strong!”

Ling looked over to the battlefield where two had already fallen.

When the other two saw Yang Ye kill two Dao Realm experts with such ease, panic finally filled their hearts.

Those capable of surviving here were naturally not cowards, but the strength Yang Ye revealed and the slaughter intent he emanated were truly too terrifying.

Flee!

They decisively chose to flee!

Yang Ye didn’t chase after them; he stayed on the spot instead.

At this moment, his desire to kill was extraordinarily strong, but his mind was still clear. He was very well aware that he wasn’t normal right now.

A long time passed before Yang Ye finally felt his intent to kill reduce slightly, and then he looked towards the side. The woman in a green dress from before was standing there.

The woman looked Yang Ye in the eyes, “The Six Slaughters of the Weapon Dao!”

Yang Ye frowned, “Who are you?!”

She took a deep and long glance at Yang Ye, “I didn’t expect it to have fallen into your hands! We’ll meet again!”

As soon as she finished speaking, she vanished into the distance with the other young man by her side.

The Six Slaughters of the Weapon Dao!

Yang Ye took a deep breath while a slightly lost expression appeared in his eyes. Because the Six Slaughters could actually affect his mind!

However, it made sense!

After all, the Weapon Path was an existence that could rival the Dao Path!

Even though he didn’t know much about the Weapon Path and Dao Path, he was very well aware that they weren’t existences that the 10 paradises or 3 holy grounds could be able to hold a candle to.

Regardless of whether it was the sword techniques that the old man in Daoist’s robes had given him, Six Slaughters of the Weapon Dao, or the Weapon Dao Compilation, they required careful studying and absorbing of the information within them.

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts and gazed at A’Man, “Let’s go!”

A’Man nodded slightly.

They didn’t leave Southern Qilin Mountain, and they just looked for an empty cave.

A’Man said, “This place should be safe!”

Yang Ye nodded, and then he sat down cross-legged, “Big Sis, Brother Ling, I’ll be meditating for a while! Thanks!”

A’Man nodded slightly, and then she left the cave with Ling.

In the cave.

Yang Ye entered the Primordial Pagoda.

Yang Ye went to Hou Qing and asked, “Senior, do you know about the Weapon Path?”

Hou Qing fell silent for a long time before he replied, “Kid, I didn’t want you to come into contact with that level of experts because your strength wasn’t sufficient. But now it seems like you’ve been swept into it from the beginning.”

Yang Ye said, “Senior, please explain it to me!”

Hou Qing nodded slightly, “There are some powers that reign supreme in the large universe. They reign supreme above all the races, and they are the Dao Path, Buddhist Path, Weapon Path, and Confucianist Path. This pagoda of yours belongs to the Dao Path.”

Yang Ye asked, “They reign supreme above all the races?”

Hou Qing nodded and explained, “They are truly supreme existences. However, there are lots of problems between them too. For example, the Dao Path is divided into many lines. If it didn’t have such a formidable enemy like the Buddhist Path, then perhaps it would have fallen into internal strife a long time ago. That isn’t a problem that only the Dao Path has, the Buddhist Path, Weapon Path, and Confucianist Path aren’t very peaceful internally.”

The Dao Path and Weapon Path!

Yang Ye fell silent. He’d been swept into these powers, and it was probably more troublesome than being pursued by all the races!

Meanwhile, Hou Qing added, “Kid, that’s all I know. The Six Slaughters of the Weapon Dao that you obtained isn’t ordinary, and you must remember to be careful when cultivating it. However, it’s an absolutely huge, fortuitous encounter for you. Your Sword Dao wasn’t the only reason that you were able to kill those Dao Realm experts with such ease, the Six Slaughters played an important role as well.”

Yang Ye nodded, “I have to study it well.”

Hou Qing nodded slightly, and then he seemed to have thought of something and added, “Right, there’s another power that can compare to the four paths.”

Yang Ye asked, “Which one?”

“The god race!” Hou Qing spoke solemnly, and his voice was quite serious when he spoke those words.

“The god race?” Yang Ye asked, “I heard you speak about them in the past. What kind of race are they?”

Hou Qing explained, “They’re a race that appeared a very long time ago, and they’re even much older than the human race. At that time, there was only a single other race in the large universe, and it was the human race. It can be said that their civilization was much more advanced than the human civilization.”

Yang Ye asked, “And then?”

Hou Qing spoke indifferently, “What do you think would happen when two different civilizations and races meet?”

Yang Ye replied, “Fight!”

Hou Qing nodded, “Exactly. In the end, all the other races led by the human race won!”

Yang Ye asked, “Then what happened to the god race?”

Hou Qing shook his head slightly, “They vanished, vanished without a trace. However, their strength is beyond doubt.”

The god race!

Yang Ye recalled the jade slip and the beast on it. Qiong Qi had said that it was the god race’s guardian beast.

As for the jade slip itself, it belonged to Zhi’er!

So, what was her background?

Yang Ye pondered deeply for a long time, and then he shook his head and decided to stop thinking about it. The important matter at hand was to perfect his attainments in the Sword Dao and Weapon Dao. Otherwise, he would be in a mess.

The Six Slaughters of the Weapon Dao, Man Slaughter!

Actually, Yang Ye could be considered to have cultivated it successfully. Man Slaughter was about killing people, and Yang Ye had killed enough in his lifetime. So, he had a huge amount of experience when it came to killing people.

However, he lacked something.

It was control!

The Six Slaughters wasn’t a technique to transform its cultivators into machines of slaughter. In order to truly succeed in the cultivation of Man Slaughter, the goal was to be able to choose whether to kill or not. Simply speaking, it was to control the desire to kill and not the opposite!

To kill or not to kill was in complete control!

Simply speaking, he had to become normal like he had been in the past!

Man Slaughter had two benefits. Firstly, the stronger one’s desire to kill was, the stronger one’s aura of slaughter would be. This aura of slaughter could become part of a person’s overall aura, and it was extremely useful when using the aura to suppress others!

Especially when his Sword Dao had attained the level of being able to crack the heart. So, adding such an aura onto that was simply like giving wings to a tiger.

That was why he’d been able to kill Dao Realm experts in an instant!

Besides that, there was one other benefit, and that was technique. Man Slaughter didn’t have any fixed moves, but he provided many different ways to kill. These methods were absolutely incredible for a sword cultivator like him who was fond of close quarter combat!

The Sword Dao and Slaughter Dao!

They didn’t conflict at all. Conversely, they were similar in many aspects. Now, his goal was to completely absorb and merge them.

Both his Sword Dao and Slaughter Dao were in quite a mess right now.

Yang Ye believed that once he fully absorbed it all and merged them together, then his strength would undergo a qualitative transformation!

Just like that, time trickled by.

In the Primordial Pagoda, Yang Ye started to meditate and think in silence, but as time passed, he started to train with the sword…
