Chapter 2238 – Then I Won’t Leave!

Yang Ye frowned slightly.

He’d been discovered!

Yang Ye shook his head. He knew that he’d underestimated the undying race.

He stopped concealing himself and walked out slowly from the shadows.

The man glanced at Yang Ye and said, “A sword cultivator?”

Yang Ye nodded.

The man chuckled, “Since you dared to come here on your own, I presume you’re very confident in yourself. Come, show it to me.”

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings, “We’re fighting here? Aren’t you afraid it’ll get destroyed?”

The man smiled, “Don’t worry, it won’t.”

Yang Ye nodded slightly, “Then bring it!”

Hiss!

As soon as he said that, a flash silently appeared beneath Yang Ye’s foot, and then a sword arrived before the man.

A smile curled up on the corners of the man’s mouth, but it carried a trace of ridicule. At the instant Yang Ye’s sword arrived before him, he stretched out his right hand slightly, and a black barrier soundlessly appeared and stopped Yang Ye’s sword!

Bang!

The black barrier shook violently but remained completely unharmed.

Meanwhile, the claw floating by his right hand clawed at Yang Ye. It was swift like a bolt of lightning and instantly arrived in front of Yang Ye.

However, Yang Ye’s reaction was extremely quick. He immediately waved the Sword Precursor horizontally at the claw.

Bang!

An explosion resounded, and then Yang Ye was blasted back with his sword. An instant later, his figure slammed against the wall. Meanwhile, a strand of black energy instantly shot toward him, and within it was a black claw clawing at him. The power it carried caused him to feel suffocated.

It was oppressive!

Bang!

A ray of blood red light swept out from Yang Ye and slammed against the black energy. As soon as they came into contact, they immediately exploded apart. However, the black claw ignored the red light from Yang Ye and arrived before him. However, it stopped around 10 inches away from Yang Ye’s face. Because a sword had pressed down against it.

It couldn’t move an inch closer!

Meanwhile, afterimages appeared in the area. They were afterimages of the man. An instant later, he appeared in front of Yang Ye, and then he raised his leg and swept it at Yang Ye’s head.

This time, Yang Ye didn’t try to defend himself. He grabbed his sword with his left hand while releasing it from his right hand, and then he slammed his fist at the man’s face!

Bang! Bang!

Yang Ye was blasted to the right and slammed against the wall. As for the man, he was blasted backward as well, and at the instant he slammed against the ground, a figure suddenly shot toward him.

Everywhere it passed, space was torn apart, and explosions resounded.

The man’s reaction was extremely swift too. He looked up and slammed his fist at Yang Ye.

Close-quartered combat!

In a place like this, they could only fight each other in close quarters. It was the rules the man had set because he didn’t allow Yang Ye to leave this place and fight outside. Actually, he was telling Yang Ye that they were going to fight in close quarters!

Yang Ye didn’t refuse because it was a strong point of his!

A collision of fists.

Bang!

Space shook violently, and then they split apart.

At the instant they split apart, a black claw flashed, and then it arrived above Yang Ye. If it descended, Yang Ye’s head would definitely explode.

The claw was no ordinary treasure, so Yang Ye didn’t go head-on against it with his body. He immediately issued a command, and the Sword Precursor transformed into a ray of light that stabbed against it.

Bang!

An invisible wave of energy rippled through the tower.

Suddenly, the man floated up and gazed at Yang Ye, and then dense death energy appeared around Yang Ye!

As soon as they appeared, Yang Ye noticed to his shock that the vitality within him was actually vanishing rapidly!

Or it should be said that once the death energy appeared, death energy had appeared within him, and it was rapidly devouring the vitality within him.

Yang Ye glanced at the man, and then a strand of faint violet energy enveloped Yang Ye. An instant later, the death energy within him was gradually suppressed.

“Huh?” The man frowned.

Suddenly, Yang Ye hurled his blood red sword at the man. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Hiss!

Space was sliced open like a rag before it.

The man’s pupils constricted slightly, and he flipped his right hand slightly. The claw by his side immediately appeared on his arm, and then a ray of black light flashed within the tower.

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!

The sound of air being torn apart resounded.

Suddenly, a wave of mysterious energy appeared here.

The Sword Domain!

As soon as it did, two types of intent appeared out of thin air!

Slaughter intent and sword intent!

At this moment, the sword in Yang Ye’s grasp had been changed to the Sword Supreme, and his slaughter intent and sword intent were at their peak now. Coupled with the Sword Domain, his strength was at his peak.

Yang Ye’s face remained expressionless as he watched the claw slam down at him, and he swung his sword with both hands.

Bang!

The man and his claw were blasted away.

Crack!

The tower suddenly cracked open and was on the verge of collapsing.

Below the wall, the man stood up slowly. As soon as he did, a sword that carried two terrifying intents shot toward him. A vicious glow flashed through his eyes as he slapped both his palms at it.

Bang!

A terrifying wave of death energy surged out from him, but Yang Ye’s sword tore it into pieces.

The Sword Supreme!

The Sword Supreme was slightly inferior in quality to the Primordial Pagoda and Bodhi Tree, but if it was in Yang Ye’s grasp, the strength it could reveal far surpassed the Primordial Pagoda and Bodhi Tree. Perhaps only the Samadhi Flame could compare to it.

After all, Yang Ye was a sword cultivator!

When the Sword Supreme was in his grasp, their union was able to bring forth its strongest!

However, if Yang Ye didn’t use the Sword Supreme, it would clearly be impossible for him to destroy this death energy with ease.

Meanwhile, a wisp of disbelief flashed through the man’s eyes when he saw his death energy being torn into bits. He hadn’t expected it to be destroyed just like that. Of course, he was even more shocked by the strength of Yang Ye’s attack. Even he couldn’t resist its might!

Suddenly, Yang Ye’s sword stopped.

Everything here fell silent.

The Sword Domain vanished as well.

Yang Ye frowned slightly. He looked at the surroundings, and then wave his right hand. The sword flew back into his grasp.

Yang Ye walked out of the tower with his sword in hand.

Outside the tower, a woman was there, Dugu Juetian.

Dugu Juetian glanced at him with a smile on her face, “Yang Ye, oh, Yang Ye! You truly surprised me. You actually came to my undying race. Yang Ye, are you too brave, or is it your ignorance that gives you this courage?”

Yang Ye shrugged, “I was just curious about the undying race, so I came to have a look. Looks like your race isn’t doing so well.”

Dugu Juetian asked, “And?”

Yang Ye said, “I’ve seen what I wanted. So, I’m leaving now. Right, there’s no need to send me off.”

Yang Ye just walked off once he finished speaking.

“HAHA!” Meanwhile, Dugu Juetian suddenly started laughing, “Yang Ye, you’re really interesting. You want to leave? You think you can leave after you’ve come here? You’re really confident!”

Yang Ye said, “I’ve had food, so there’s no need to make me stay for some.”

Dugu Juetian laughed coldly, “What if I insist?”

Yang Ye tapped his sword lightly against the ground, “I like to kill before I eat. Since you want me to stay and eat, then I’ll kill a few first!”

As soon as he finished speaking, his sword shot forward.

Dugu Juetian’s pupils constricted, and she stabbed her spear forward.

Bang!

A rumbling explosion resounded, and then she was blasted far away with her spear.

Suddenly, the man in the tower walked out of it. Yang Ye glanced at him and swung his sword.

Hiss!

A ray of sword energy tore through the air.

The energy carried within this attack which contained two types of peak Progenitor Realm intents was even too much for space to endure, and it started cracking open and collapsing.

The man’s expression changed drastically, and he grabbed the claw and slapped it forward.

Bang!

The man was blasted back into the tower, and his fate was unknown.

Yang Ye didn’t follow up with another attack. He turned around to gaze at Dugu Juetian, and then he started walking slowly in her direction. He dragged his sword against the ground as he walked slowly, causing dazzling sparks to flare up.

Dugu Juetian just stared at Yang Ye, “Yang Ye, let me see if you can escape my undying race’s territory today!”

As soon as she finished speaking, she hurled her spear at him.

Hiss!

Space was torn apart in its wake.

Yang Ye’s face remained indifferent as he swung his sword.

Hiss!

Dugu Juetian’s spear was instantly sliced into two, and her face sank from the sight of it.

Yang Ye’s strength was at such a level now!

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings, and then he started walking toward Dugu Juetian, “I just came here to have a look, and I didn’t come with ill intent. I’m serious. Now, I’ve finished having my look, so I have to leave.”

Dugu Juetian looked him in the eye, “Can you?”

Yang Ye stopped, “Then I won’t go.”

As soon as he said that, a strand of slaughter intent swept out from him, and the sky above the ancient city turned blood red.
