Chapter 2757 – The Ordinary Sword!

In the Primordial Pagoda, a white shadow shot up into the air.

Snowy appeared on Yang Ye’s shoulder.

Yang Ye hurriedly enveloped her with the Sword Domain to keep out the heat coming from the flames. However, the flames were too terrifying to the point even his Sword Domain was failing to resist it.

Snowy looked up at the ocean of flames. She blinked, and then she opened her mouth and inhaled.

Hiss!

The ocean of flames instantly turned ethereal!

Yang Ye was quite shocked by the sight of this.

She can even absorb all of that?

Snowy soared up slowly into the air and opened her little mouth. A moment later, the flames around them rapidly turned ethereal and started to tremble.

It was working!

Yang Ye was overjoyed because Snowy really was able to counter the Omni Phantom.

The Omni Phantom was the strongest flame in the universe, but it was still a sprite, and Snowy was the leader of all sprites!

That was why he’d summoned Snowy!

Suddenly, the ocean of flames trembled, and then a flame shot off into outer space.

It had fled!

Once it fled, the ocean of flames started to disperse and vanished shortly.

However, this world had been completely destroyed!

Yang Ye vanished on the spot with Snowy, and he arrived in outer space. When he looked back, the world from before was completely burning. It was like a huge ball of flames!

Yang Ye was shocked from the sight of this. The flames were truly formidable!

Meanwhile, Jian Wudi and the others appeared behind him.

All of them had extremely solemn expressions on their faces as they gazed at the burning world!

A short while passed before Yang Ye moved his gaze away, “Let’s head back.”

They nodded.

They returned to Universe City. This time, all of them had something weighing down on their minds. Because Yang Busi had left, and besides Yang Ye, An Nanjing, and the Evil Beast, there was practically no one else on their side who could fight the mysterious expert!

Moreover, the mysterious expert’s true strength was still a mystery!

Luckily, Yang Ye didn’t seem to be troubled, and he seemed absolutely calm as always.

At this moment, they thought of Destiny!

After all, Yang Ye had Destiny’s support!

So, they seemed to relax quite a bit upon thinking of that.

“Brother Yang!” Suddenly, Yan Wu called out to Yang Ye.

Yang Ye gazed at him, “Yes?”

Yan Wu smiled, “The Formation Daoist, Chen Dao’zi is here!”

Yang Ye hurriedly said, “Come on, let’s go see him!”

Yan Wu nodded, and then he led Yang Ye to the entrance of Universe City. An old man in a gray robe was there.

The old man had a head of white hair, and he seemed quite old.

Meanwhile, the old man gazed at Yang Ye.

Yang Ye went over and smiled, “Welcome, Senior Chen!”

Chen Dao’zi glanced at Yang Ye, “The young are truly formidable!”

Yang Ye smiled, “Please come inside!”

Chen Dao’zi shook his head, glanced at the surroundings, and said, “Let’s talk business first.”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and nodded, “Of course!”

Chen Dao’zi looked Yang Ye in the eyes, “My clan and I would like a home here.”

Yang Ye smiled and remained silent.

The old man continued, “Of course, I will set up a grand formation, an extremely powerful formation for Universe City!”

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed, “Tell me about it!”

Chen Dao’zi replied solemnly, “I plan to set up the Universe Formation!”

Yang Ye was quite puzzled, “The Universe Formation?”

Chen Dao’zi nodded, “The Universe Formation is a formation with the universe as its foundation. Simply speaking, I will travel the universe, or I should say I will visit the large worlds throughout the universe, and I will set up the formation there. After that, with the entire universe as its foundation, the entire universe will be linked once the formation is activated, and it would possess tremendous power!”

Yang Ye frowned slightly, “The universe would be linked?”

Chen Dao’zi nodded, “It’s a formation that was created by my clan in the past. However, we’ve never had a chance to actually set it up. Because there are all sorts of powers throughout the universe, it's impossible to set up the formation in their territory. But it’s different now, the entire universe is practically united. Under such circumstances, it’s entirely possible to set up this formation!”𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Yang Ye asked solemnly, “How powerful would it be?”

Chen Dao’zi gazed at Yang Ye, “I don’t know, but it won’t be weak.”

Yang Ye asked, “What do you need?”

Chen Dao’zi replied solemnly, “I need many, many things. Firstly, I need the cooperation of all the powers in the universe. Secondly, I need help, it’s best if they are Destiny Realm experts. Thirdly, I need a core for the formation!”

Yang Ye asked, “A core?”

Chen Dao’zi nodded, “Actually, there’s something very suitable for that job, the divine vein. I want to use it as the formation’s core. It resides in Eternal Kingdom, so if it’s used as the formation’s core, it will be able to bring out the full potential of the formation.”

Yang Ye asked, “Will it harm the divine vein?”

Chen Dao’zi gazed at Yang Ye, “That depends on all of you! If you can stop your enemies, then the formation will be like the icing on a cake, and it may even be critical in your battle. However, if you fail, everything will be lost!”

Yang Ye smiled, “True!”

They really couldn’t entrust their hopes to the formation. It was only something that would assist them in their battle!

Meanwhile, Chen Dao’zi said, “Besides that, I need the Sprite Progenitor’s help.”

Yang Ye asked, “Why?”

Chen Dao’zi explained, “Because a lot of spirit energy is necessary. The formation needs too, too much spirit energy that must be stored within it. In that way, the formation will be able to truly release all of its potential. It can be said that the formation is impossible to set up without the Sprite Progenitor. She is the most important part of it all!”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and replied, “Alright!”

Chen Dao’zi gazed at Yang Ye, “Thank you!”

Yang Ye smiled, “It’s we who should be thanking you.”

Yang Ye sent a voice transmission while he spoke, and then Ding Shaoyao appeared before him.

Yang Ye said, “This is Ding Shaoyao. Hmm, she can be considered to be Universe City’s Military Advisor. You can ask her for anything you need, and she’ll help with your work on building the Universe Formation. Besides that, your clan can come here. Of course, I’m sure you’re aware that while this place has the best spirit energy, it’s the most dangerous place as well. At the very least, that’s true for now! So, think about it carefully!”

Chen Dao’zi nodded, “I wouldn’t have come here if I hadn’t given it enough thought.”

It was his clan’s last opportunity to rise up again. Because they were safe here, or at the very least, there was no danger from the inside. Secondly, they could gain resources, and that was the most important part!

Yang Ye nodded, “Contact me if the Sprite Progenitor is needed.”

Yang Ye left once he finished speaking.

A short while later, a formation appeared in Universe City with Ding Shaoyao’s help. It was a formation that covered the entire city, and it was emanating fluctuations of energy. These fluctuations were spreading toward the entire universe.

In the Primordial Pagoda.

Yang Ye didn’t interfere in the matters of Universe City, nor was it necessary for him to do so. The various powers in the city were in a relatively balanced position, and so no chaos would befall the city while he was alright!

Of course, once something happened to him, then these fellows might start indulging in their own selfish intentions.

In the cultivation room, Yang Ye sat cross-legged on the ground, and the Sword Precursor was in front of him.

Presently, for some reason, he wasn’t interested in any other sword.

Even Burial. It was almost unmatched among swords, but Yang Ye wasn’t interested in wielding it. He would still use it, but it wasn’t his main sword!

Yang Ye gazed at the Sword Precursor and the past flashed through his mind.

The moment he met the Sword Precursor, everything he experienced with her… During this time, there was even a period when he stopped using it.

Especially after he obtained the Sword Supreme, the Sword Precursor had been left alone for a long time. Because the Sword Supreme had been the strongest sword!

Later on, he obtained even more swords, like the swords of Destiny…

Yang Ye touched the Sword Precursor gently, and a long time passed before he spoke softly, “Forgive me.”

In the past, he pursued the strongest sword, and he’d overlooked the Sword Precursor that had never left his side. To a certain extent, his understanding of the sword had gone off the right path.

There was no strongest sword, only the most suitable sword!

At this moment, he finally understood why the Unfettered One had abandoned his sword and wielded that sword of his once more!

Abandoning the sword was a realm of comprehension, an extreme realm in the Emotionless Sword Dao. A realm where his heart was empty, and not even the sword could enter it. As for when he took up that sword once more, it was a different realm! It was a realm that led to the core of the Sword Dao!

Emotionlessness didn’t represent being heartless. When he took up the sword again, he was actually retaking his heart.

What was that?

It was so that he would be one who never forgot his original intentions, his heart!

Yang Ye suddenly chuckled. He picked up the Sword Precursor and walked out of the cultivation room. He looked up at the Sword Sect in the distance. Su Qingshi and the others were there. A moment later, his gaze moved over to where Snowy and Erya were, and they seemed to be up to something.

Profounder Continent, the smaller and larger worlds… Now, the Three Dimensional Universe…

What had he been seeking throughout this path?

Yang Ye asked himself that question.

The answer quickly came to him!

To protect!

He wanted to use his sword to protect everything close to him, and the sword was something he wanted to protect too. The sword wasn’t a tool, so it was something he had to protect as well.

As soon as he thought up to this point, a sword howl resounded through the sky, and then a blood red sword shot up into the air and soared through the sky.

The sword howl resounded through the entire sky!

Meanwhile, An Nanjing looked up at the Sword Precursor, and a short while passed before she spoke softly, “The Quasi Ordinary Sword!”

The Quasi Ordinary Sword!

The Ordinary Sword!

What was the Ordinary Sword?

The initial, the most ordinary, but the truest.

The truest was not ordinary.

The Ordinary Sword!
