Chapter 1693 - The Yang Clan Will Be Buried With Him?

The Divine Yin Flame!

It spread swiftly. When the Yang Clan’s experts reacted, the Divine Yin Flame had stretched throughout Phecda City. In an instant, the entire city became a flaming one, and it only took an instant for it to be burnt to ash.

The remaining members of the 72 warriors and the 10 black clothed figures around Yang Ye were instantly incinerated into ashes. As for the two True Realm experts, they’d fled quickly and had avoided the Divine Yin Flame before it could sweep to them. Moreover, they’d joined forces to resist the flames. So, they’d survived.

But the flames were still burning.

So, howls of sorrow and misery resounded throughout the city.

Suddenly, a terrifying aura descended from the sky, and the Divine Yin Flame was instantly pressed down to the ground. However, as soon as they touched the ground, the ground was incinerated into nothingness as well.

However, it didn’t take long for the Divine Yin Flame to suddenly vanish completely.

Yang Ye naturally desired to continue burning everything. But he couldn’t. If he continued, his body would be the first to be unable to endure it.

Even though his body was at the Zenith Realm right now, he couldn’t endure the Divine Yin Flames for too long. After all, its strength far surpassed his.

An Nanjing and Qiong Qi returned to Yang Ye’s side. An Nanjing walked over to Yang Ye’s side, “Are you alright?”

Qiong Qi spoke as well, “Kid, don’t tell me that you’re going to die!”

Regardless of whether it was Qiong Qi or An Nanjing, their eyes carried worry. Because Yang Ye had used a force that surpassed the limits of his body, so it would definitely cause huge problems for him.

Yang Ye fell silent for a few breaths of time before slowly opening his eyes. There was a trace of sickly redness in his eyes. Moreover, his countenance was quite terrifyingly pale.

Yang Ye shook his head slightly, and then he withdrew two Energy Pearls. He was just about to consume them when he suddenly stopped.

Energy Pearls!

He only had two left right now!

Yang Ye fell silent for an instant, and then he passed one to An Nanjing. An Nanjing had fought quite a few battles, and her profound energy was almost completely exhausted. She needed Energy Pearls too. Otherwise, she wouldn’t be able to continue fighting.

She glanced at Yang Ye and shook her head, “You need it more than I do.”

Yang Ye was about to speak when Snowy suddenly appeared before them. After that, Snowy raised her claws, and a pearl appeared in her grasp.

The Spirit Pearl!

Snowy was holding the Spirit Pearl that Yang Ye had obtained from the Spirit Race.

Yang Ye didn’t know what she meant, and he was just about to ask when she suddenly started to rub the Spirit Pearl with both her claws. As she rubbed incessantly, countless strands of spirit energy seeped out from it. Snowy opened her mouth and sucked, and all the spirit energy entered her mouth.

After that, she patted her belly lightly, and then opened her mouth. Two pearls floated out of her mouth.

Energy Pearls!

Yang Ye was visibly astounded. He hadn’t expected her to be able to create Energy Pearls!

Meanwhile, Snowy grabbed one of them and passed it to An Nanjing. An Nanjing glanced at Snowy, and then she took it, hesitated for a moment, and said, “Thank you!”

Snowy cracked a smile and quickly waved her claws as if she was saying that An Nanjing didn’t have to thank her.

An Nanjing nodded slightly and didn’t say anything.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye took the other Energy Pearl in Snowy’s claws. A wisp of surprise flashed through his eyes when he picked it up. Because the energy contained within it was much purer than the Energy Pearls he had!

Yang Ye didn’t hesitate to swallow it. In an instant, countless strands of spirit energy appeared within him, and then they were absorbed by the Primordial Pagoda. After that, countless strands of violet energy seeped out from the tiny vortex and dispersed throughout his body, repairing his damaged body.

With the Primordial Violet Energy there to heal him, his body instantly started to recover rapidly.

Yang Ye rubbed Snowy’s head and said, “Help me make more, alright?”

Snowy blinked, nodded, and then flashed back into the Primordial pagoda.

Once she returned to the Primordial Pagoda, Yang Ye looked up towards the distance. Another old man had appeared there. The old man wore a black robe. His robe was extremely long, and its ends were being dragged against the ground. He held a cane with a dragon head, and the cane was covered in tiny scales. Besides that, there was a bright pearl at the top of the cane.

If one went closer and looked carefully, one would notice that it was no pearl, but an eye!

The old man was the Vice Hall Master of the Yang Clan’s Discipline Hall, Yang Gu! He could be considered as at the third level of authority in the Yang Clan.

Yang Gu gazed at Yang Ye for a long time and said, “We thought that the 72 warriors, the Shadow Guard, and three True Realm experts would be enough to kill you. But we never expected that not only were all 72 warriors annihilated, we lost almost all the shadow guard as well, and even Phecda City was destroyed! All of this was truly unexpected!”

At this moment, Yang Gu, Yang Shen, and all the others had extremely unsightly expressions on their faces. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

After all, all 72 warriors and 10 of the Shadow Guard had been annihilated!

It was a great blow to the Yang Clan. At the very least, it was impossible to rebuild the 72 warriors in a short while.

Even though it couldn’t be considered as a serious blow to the clan, the loss that the Yang Clan had suffered this time was quite painful.

Yang Ye glanced at them and remained silent.

Six True Realm experts!

Meanwhile, Yang Gu added, “If we knew how strong you were, perhaps we would have used a different method. Or to be more precise, the neutral parties in the clan wouldn’t have allowed us to kill you.”

Yang Ye asked, “What about now?”

Yang Gu looked Yang Ye in the eyes, “Now you must die. Even if we don’t kill you, those neutral fellows will kill you. Because the clan won’t allow anyone hostile to the clan to continue growing. Especially you. If you’re allowed to grow, you’ll definitely be a threat to my Yang Clan.”

Yang Ye fell silent for a short while and said, “I never had a sense of belonging to the Yang Clan, but I never felt hostile towards it nor did I have any intention to fight for the position of succession. But all of you forced me to return, and now you’re forcing me to die.”

He glanced at Yang Gu’s group and continued, “I’ll definitely repay the Yang Clan a hundredfold for what it has done to me today!”

Yang Gu gazed at Yang Ye for a long time, “That will only strengthen our resolve to kill you.”

Yang Ye chuckled, “I’m just revealing my deepest thoughts. Because I’m very well aware that it doesn’t make a difference whether I say that or not. All of you won’t let me live. Right?”

Yang Gu nodded, “Indeed!”

Yang Ye pointed the wooden sword at Yang Gu, “I think we should stop wasting our breaths. What do all of you want? I’ll accompany you until the end!”

Yang Gu nodded slightly, and then he looked up at the sky, “Everyone who wants to see him dead, show yourselves. Otherwise, he may survive today. If he does, all of you’ll die.”

As soon as Yang Gu finished speaking, a black robed old man suddenly appeared behind Yang Gu.

A True Realm expert!

Once the black robed old man arrived, another 15 old men appeared behind him.

All of them were Half-Step True Realm experts!

Seven True Realm and 15 Half-Step True Realm experts!

Even though such a force wasn’t the Yang Clan’s full strength, it was equivalent to 70% of its strength.

Meanwhile, Qiong Qi said, “Kid, what did you do in your last life?! So many people want to kill you when all you did was go home!”

Yang Ye glanced at Yang Gu’s group. He hadn’t expected that so many in the Yang Clan wanted to see him dead. Even though he didn’t recognize them, he had no doubt that their status in the clan was definitely not low.

Suddenly, Qiong Qi gazed at Yang Gu’s group, “I really don’t understand. Is your Yang Clan filled with idiots? Do you know who this kid is? He doesn’t just possess great karmic luck, great karma is attached to him. So long as you have him, the Yang Clan won’t just remain as a clan here, it might even be possible for it to be ranked on the divine and immortal rankings.”

His voice suddenly grew louder at this point, “However, all of you want to kill him. You idiots! If you kill him, all of you’ll be killed too.”

Meanwhile, Yang Ye asked, “Brother Qiong Qi, you’re saying I really do have people to rely on?”

“Of course!” Qiong Qi spoke angrily, “Listen, if you die, someone will definitely avenge you. So, there’s no need to fear death. Because someone will definitely bury the Yang Clan along with you!”

Yang Ye didn’t know what to say.

Meanwhile, Qiong Qi added, “You haven’t just obtained that thing’s acknowledgement, you’ve obtained its master’s acknowledgement. Moreover, he gave you an assignment. Do you know what that represents? It represents that he’s willing to be bound by karma to you. Or to be more precise, you can be considered to be a disciple of his that’s many generations apart. If you die, he’ll definitely avenge you!”

Yang Ye puckered his lips, “Revenge is useless. Staying alive is the most important right now.”

Qiong Qi shook his head, “He should have been able to sense your arrival by now. The reason he hasn’t come to see you may be because he’s in closed door cultivation or he has been delayed by something else.”

“How laughable!” Suddenly, Yang Gu spoke abruptly, “Bury my Yang Clan with him? How truly laughable! You…”

“Laughable my ass!” Qiong Qi roared furiously, “I don’t want to speak with an idiot like you and make myself look stupid!”

As he spoke, he gazed at Yang Ye and An Nanjing, “The more trump cards you reveal in battle here, the better the ‘treatment’ you will get will be. So, we have to retreat.”

Yang Ye and An Nanjing exchanged glances, and then they appeared on Qiong Qi’s back.

Qiong Qi slapped his claws against space and transformed into a black ray of light that shot towards the sky.

A cold smile curled up on the corners of Yang Gu’s mouth, “Can you escape?”

Bang!

As soon as he finished speaking, a huge barrier of light appeared in the sky, and then numerous terrifying auras slammed down at Qiong Qi.

Bang!

Qiong Qi’s figure crashed towards the ground.

Boom!

An instant later, they’d returned to where they had been just a moment ago.

Meanwhile, Yang Gu and the others had surrounded them.
