Chapter 1949 – Eating People!

As soon as he entered the black hole, Yang Ye felt a wave of terrifying suction force.

It made his entire body tense up, and it felt like a million horses were pulling on him!

Yang Ye hurriedly circulated his profound energy, and he gradually felt better as the Primordial Violet Energy healed him.

A long time later, Yang Ye felt his body gradually calm down, and the dizziness he felt alleviated tremendously.

“Another fat sheep is here!” Suddenly, a voice resounded in Yang Ye’s ears.

Yang Ye shook his head forcefully and opened his eyes. As soon as he did, he couldn’t help but frown.

A dark sky, a terrible smell, and practically nonexistent spirit energy.

The Dead Dimension.

Yang Ye knew that he was in the Dead Dimension.

It was terrible here!

That was what Yang Ye felt right now. This damnable place had absolutely scarce spirit energy, and it could be said to be utterly unsuitable for cultivation.

“Newcomer!” Suddenly, a voice pulled Yang Ye back to reality.

Yang Ye turned towards its source, and he saw a group standing not too far to his right. There were both men and women amongst them, and they were around the age of 30. They were led by a man with a broken arm, and he was chewing on a blade of unknown grass while carrying a playful smile on his face.

The young man had been the one who’d spoken earlier!

The young man’s cultivation wasn’t high, and it was merely at the 2nd stage of the True Realm!

Yang Ye sized up their group and asked, “Do you need something?”

The corners of the young man’s mouth curled up slightly. He spat out the grass and said, “That’s a good question. Since you’ve asked, then I’ll be frank. We need immortal crystals, and we’d like to borrow some from you. You just came from the outside world, so you should have quite a few of them, right?”

“Robbery!” Yang Ye nodded, “You plan to rob me!”

“What are you talking about, Brother?” The young man spoke with displeasure, “Am I, Tan Kun, a person like that? We just want to borrow some, and we’ll return them once we have enough. Right, we should return it!”

Yang Ye flipped his hand, and a bunch of immortal crystals appeared in his grasp. There were 10 of them there.

Tan Kun and the others’ eyes lit up when they witnessed this, and there was undisguised greed and desire in their eyes.

There was no spirit energy here, so immortal crystals were exceptionally precious. It could be said that even their eyes weren’t as important as these crystals.

Yang Ye waved the immortal crystals and said, “Come get it yourself?”

Tan Kun’s eyes narrowed slightly. The greed in his eyes vanished slightly while seriousness appeared to replace it.

How many who dared to come here were ordinary?

Even then, he still didn’t want to give up on robbing Yang Ye.

Tan Kun stomped his foot against the ground. The entire ground shook violently from it, and his figure relied on the counterforce to shoot towards Yang Ye. When he arrived around 10m away from Yang Ye, he slammed his first forward!

The air was instantly torn apart, and space even shook violently as if it was about to shatter.

Yang Ye stood on the spot with indifference on his face. He suddenly clenched his right fist when Tan Kun’s fist arrived in front of him, and then he slammed it forward!

A head-on collision!

Boom!

As soon as they collided, a powerful wave of force instantly swept out from the point of collision, and both of them were blasted backwards.

But it didn’t take long for Yang Ye to stop, and Tan Kun was still moving backwards.

After moving an entire kilometer back, Tan Kun stopped. He glanced at his fist. At this moment, it had warped, and it was especially so for his arm, it had warped completely.

Tan Kun looked up at Yang Ye, “I didn’t expect you to be a body cultivator!”

Yang Ye waved the immortal crystals in his grasp, “Do you still want them?”

Tan Kun grinned, “Of course!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he raised his right hand, and a saber appeared in his grasp. After that, he appeared before Yang Ye and slashed.

Everywhere it passed, space was sliced open!

Yang Ye didn’t use his sword and just slammed another punch forward!

Bang!

An explosion resounded, and Yang Ye was blasted 300m away while a deep and blood red mark appeared on his fist.

Tan Kun’s saber could pierce his defenses!

Just as Yin Hou had said, the quality of the experts here was much greater than the outside world!

Meanwhile, numerous afterimages appeared in front of Yang Ye, and a saber appeared above his head!

The tip of the sword flickered with a ghastly cold glow!

Yang Ye twisted his right hand slightly. In an instant, an ethereal dragon claw appeared around his right hand, and then he stretched it forward and grabbed the saber.

Tan Kun’s expression changed when Yang Ye grabbed his saber. Meanwhile, a wave of force struck his hand, and then Yang Ye had pulled away his saber. After that, Yang Ye swung it at him!

Bang!

A figure was blasted over 10km away!

It was Tan Kun!

After he formed the dragon claw around his hand and used the Sky Dragon’s strength, Yang Ye’s strength had instantly multiplied many times!

It was the strength he gained from draconification!

A wisp of blood seeped out from the corner of Tan Kun’s mouth, and there was a deep injury on his chest. It was extremely deep to the point it seemed like his chest had been sliced open.

Tan Kun wiped off the blood on the corner of his mouth and looked up at Yang Ye, “Amazing!”

Yang Ye ignored Tan Kun and glanced at the surroundings. He was on a huge circular platform, and a pitch black hole was high above in the sky behind him. However, it was surrounded by a mysterious formation, so its suction force didn’t leak out into this world.

Yang Ye restrained his gaze and looked at Tan Kun. After that, he flicked three immortal crystals to Tan Kun.

Tan Kun was slightly stunned and gazed at Yang Ye with a puzzled expression.

Yang Ye said, “I want information about the Dead Dimension!”

Tan Kun shook his head slightly, “I don’t know much!” Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Yang Ye asked, “You just arrived here too?”

Tan Kun shook his head, “I’ve been here for more than 10 years. The reason I don’t know much is because we can’t just travel around in this damnable place.”

Yang Ye frowned, “What do you mean?”

Tan Kun explained, “There are three organizations in an area of 50,000km around us. It’s the Dire Wolves, Devil Cave, and Sky Residence City. I don’t know about the world beyond that.”

Yang Ye asked, “Didn’t you go have a look?”

Tan Kun laughed bitterly, “Endless mountains fill the surroundings, and there are extremely dangerous things lurking in the mountains.”

“Extremely dangerous things?” Yang Ye asked, “What things?”

Tan Kun shook his head, “I don’t know. In any case, even Dao Realm experts dare not rashly step foot into the mountain range.”

Yang Ye fell silent for a moment and said, “Which side do all of you belong to?”

Tan Kun had quite an embarrassed expression on his face when he heard Yang Ye’s question.

A short while passed before Tan Kun said, “We don’t belong to any one of them. We… Fine, they don’t want us, alright?”

“They don’t want you?” Yang Ye glanced at Tan Kun’s group. The weakest amongst them was at the Enlightened Realm, yet those organizations actually didn’t want them!

Tan Kun laughed bitterly, “All of them possess a spirit vein, so they only recruit extremely strong people or those with great potential. After all, the spirit energy they have is limited, so they can’t waste it on ordinary people.”

He gazed at Yang Ye and continued, “It shouldn’t be a problem for you to join them. I suggest you go to Sky Residence City. Because their leader is human.”

Yang Ye glanced at Tan Kun and the others, “Why don’t all of you leave?”

“Leave?” Tan Kun laughed bitterly, “It’s easy to come in here, it’s not that easy to leave!”

As he spoke, he pointed at the huge black hole behind Yang Ye, “See the formation around it? That formation traps the black hole, but it traps our hope from entering it too. It was jointly set up by some extraordinary experts to prevent this world from being devoured by that black hole. They were afraid others would damage the formation on purpose, so they specially strengthened it. Moreover, anyone who gets within 300m of it will cause the formation to activate and attack them!”

Yang Ye asked, “Is it very strong?”

Tan Kun nodded, “Extremely strong. A Know Dao Realm expert once tried to get through it, and he was instantly killed!”

Instantly!

Yang Ye frowned. A Know Dao Realm expert! Yin Hou’s at the Know Dao Realm!

How terrifying was it to be able to instantly kill someone like Yin Hou!

Yang Ye gazed at the formation. It was a formation, so the holy sword should be able to cut through it. However, the problem was resisting the formation’s attacks. Otherwise, even if he could cut through it, he would be killed by it!

He had to improve his strength if he wanted to leave!

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts and gazed at Tan Kun, “How do I get to Sky Residence City?”

Tan Kun pointed to the right, “Just travel in that direction. You’ll see the city soon!”

Yang Ye nodded slightly and was about to speak. Suddenly, an ear piercing scream resounded from their right.

Tan Kun and the others’ expressions changed drastically when they heard this, “It’s the devil men! Run!”

As soon as he finished speaking, all of them shot towards the distance.

Devil men?

Yang Ye looked up, and he saw around 10 tall and huge figures in the distance. They were a little different from ordinary humans. Their bodies were much bigger and taller, and their skin was quite dark.

Most importantly, they were holding a human head.

After that, they shot towards Yang Ye’s direction while chewing on the corpse in their hands.

They were eating people!
