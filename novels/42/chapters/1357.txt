Chapter 1358 – Long Time No See! Little Laborer!

Book 11 — The Madman Returns

Yang Ye seemed excited as he stood in his room, and his eyes were filled with wild joy and excitement.

Why?

Because the Primordial Pagoda was about to return to normal.

At this moment, the tiny vortex was spinning at high speeds, and strands of aura were seeping out incessantly from it.

Yang Ye sat cross-legged in the room and waited in silence.

He was quite excited and happy. Of course, he felt even more anticipation. Because if nothing unexpected occurred, then he would be able to see Su Qingshi and the others right away.

Qingshi, Qin Xiyue, Bao’er, Lei Lin, Little Yao, and his daughter, Yang Nianxue.

Around 6 hours passed just like that.

Bang!

A terrifying aura suddenly appeared throughout Doomsday City, shocking its residents. However, it didn’t take long for the aura to suddenly vanish as if it had never appeared.

Yang Ye’s eyes closed slowly, and it didn’t take long for him to vanish on the spot.

Within the Primordial Pagoda,

A woman was standing before Yang Ye. She wore a white dress, and she seemed pure like a goddess. It was Su Qingshi, of course. Yang Ye’s eyes instantly became moist as he gazed at the beautiful and charming woman standing before him. He grinned, walked over to her, and then hugged her tightly.

He embraced her tightly as if he was terribly afraid of losing her!

A long time passed before Yang Ye spoke softly, “We’re finally able to see each other again!”

Two streams of tears seeped out of the corners of Su Qingshi’s eyes when she heard him. After all, when the Primordial Pagoda was sealed off, she’d lost contact with Yang Ye as well, and no one knew how she’d overcome such days.

It had been filled with anxiety and fear!

Days and nights of anxiety and fear!

Yang Ye had been in a hopeless situation at that time!

Suddenly, a voice came from afar, “Hey, we’re here as well!”

Su Qingshi hurriedly released Yang Ye when she heard the voice. Yang Ye looked up, and he saw a curvaceous woman in a red dress looking at him with discontent.

Qin Xiyue!

Yang Ye was about to speak when she ran over to him and kissed him.

“Big Sister Bao’er, what are they doing?” A young girl with pigtails was looking at Yang Ye and Qin Xiyue with a curious gaze. She was around 8 or 9 years old, wore a small dress embroidered with flowers, and she had big eyes. She looked really like Yang Ye.

“Xue’er, you can’t see that!” A woman around the age of 20 suddenly covered the young girl’s eyes. After that, she pulled over another young girl on her right and said, “Lei Lin, you’re not allowed to look too.”

“Big Sister Bao’er, why can’t I?” Lei Lin blanked while bewilderment filled her eyes.

Bao’er hurriedly covered Lei Lin’s eyes, “You’re still young, so you can’t!”

Meanwhile, Qin Xiyue had let go of Yang Ye and glared at him, “Tell us the truth. How many more women have you gotten in these years?”

Su Qingshi gazed at Yang Ye as well.

Yang Ye’s face was absolutely dark, “Am I that lustful?”

Qin Xiyue replied with a question, “Are you not?”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

Suddenly, a clear and melodious voice came from afar, “Are you daddy?”

Yang Ye’s figure shuddered when he heard the voice, and then he looked up and saw a young girl with pigtails looking at him with a curious gaze.

Yang Ye took a deep breath and went over to her. He carried her up in his arms and smiled, “Xue’er, say that again.”

Xue’er glanced at Su Qingshi, and Su Qingshi nodded slightly with a smile on her face. Xue’er gazed at Yang Ye again, hesitated for a moment, and then spoke softly, “Dad....”

Yang Ye’s eyes became moist again. He naturally felt very guilty when it came to her. Because he hadn’t been by her side for long since she’d been born. Especially once she’d entered the Primordial Pagoda. It had been sealed for around 5 or 6 years, so he hadn’t been by her side at all during this time!

As a father, he was absolutely not a good one!

Suddenly, a slightly timid voice resounded, “Big Brother!”

Yang Ye turned around and saw Lei Li looking at him. There was a slightly timid expression in her eyes, and she was slightly hesitant yet slightly happy as well.

Lei Lin was still the same. She was still that small, and her body hadn’t changed at all throughout the last few years.

Yang Ye smiled as he gazed at her, and then waved at her. She hesitated for a moment before walking over to Yang Ye. Yang Ye carried her up with his other arm, and then he kissed both Lei Lin and Xue’er on the cheek. In the beginning, Xue’er was slightly distant, but it didn’t take long for her to gradually get used to Yang Ye, and then she started to call him ‘Daddy’ in a very natural manner.

After playing with Xue’er and Lei Lin for a while, Yang Ye gazed at the young woman standing at the side.

The young woman grinned, “Long time no see! Little Laborer!

Little Laborer!

Yang Ye chuckled. It was Bao’er, of course. At this moment, she’d grown up into a graceful young woman, but she still seemed utterly mischievous. Besides Bao’er, there was another woman there, and this woman once had quite a bit of enmity with him.

It was An Biru of course!

An Biru nodded slightly when she saw him look at her, and it could be considered as greeting him.

Yang Ye nodded lightly to her as well. Even though there was enmity between them in the past, it had been resolved a long time ago. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Yang Ye seemed to have thought of something, and he turned to look at Su Qingshi, “Qingshi, I remember sending some members of the Ding Clan in here. How are they?”

Su Qingshi replied, “We left them in an unconscious state.”

“Good!” Yang Ye nodded. Besides those who were closest to him, he didn’t want anyone else to know about the Primordial Pagoda, nor did he dare to let others find out about it.

Yang Ye asked, “Where’s Little Yao?” He looked through the area but didn’t see her.

Su Qingshi spoke softly, “She’s in closed door cultivation. She’s charging into the Quasi Emperor Realm.”

The Quasi Emperor Realm! Yang Ye glanced at the others. He was quite surprised because SU Qingshi, Qin Xiyue, and An Biru were Emperors. Even Bao’er who wasn’t fond of cultivating was a high-rank Saint. As for Xue’er, she was an Exalt!

As if she’d noticed Yang Ye’s shock, Su Qingshi explained, “The spirit energy here is very abundant. Moreover, it’s unlike the spirit energy in the outside world. So we cultivate very quickly.”

“So that’s why!” Yang Ye nodded. The spirit energy here was naturally very abundant. After all, there were so few people here yet so much spirit energy. Moreover, it wasn’t ordinary spirit energy but violet energy. Even though the violet energy here was much inferior to Primordial Violet Energy, it was countless times better than ordinary spirit energy!

So, they naturally cultivated much faster within the Primordial Pagoda!

Meanwhile, Su Qingshi said, “Tell us about everything that has happened throughout these years!”

Qin Xiyue hurriedly said, “Right, tell us. Don’t even think about not mentioning how many women you’ve gotten in the last few years!”

Yang Ye chuckled, and then he started to summarize everything that had happened from Profounder Continent to the Radiant Dimension, and then to Dark Hell Continent. Of course, he didn’t mention the dangers he faces because he didn’t want them to feel worried.

Even though Yang Ye had skipped the dangerous events, how could they not realize how dangerous it would have been?

Su Qingshi remained silent, and she just held tightly to his hand.

Yang Ye glanced at them and said, “Let’s not split up again.”

Meanwhile, Su Qingshi suddenly said, “I want to stay on Dark Hell Continent!”

Qin Xiyue said, “Me too!”

An Biru joined in, “I want to stay as well!”

Yang Ye gazed at them while bewilderment filled his eyes, “Why?”

Qin Xiyue explained, “The Sword Alliance is a power that you established, so you definitely need people to manage it. An Biru and I have quite a bit of skill when it comes to management. As for Qingshi, she’s your first wife, so her presence will be able to reassure the members of the Sword Alliance. After all, so long as she’s here, the others would know that you’d definitely be back one day. In that way, then out of consideration for your power and influence, the residents of this continent would probably not dare to have any malicious thoughts.”

Yang Ye remained silent for a short while before he said, “I don’t want to be separated from all of you again.”

Su Qingshi shook her head slightly, “We don’t want to become your burdens!”

Even though they were Emperors, as far as Yang Ye was concerned, Emperors were of no help to him in battle. If they stayed with him, they would only be burdens to him. But if they stayed on Dark Hell Continent, then they would be able to help him.

Yang Ye was still quite hesitant. Even though he knew that staying behind was a very good choice for them. After all, it would be very difficult for Yun Banqing to manage the Sword Alliance on her own. Even Ye Liuyun who was so capable of management found it almost impossible to completely manage the Sword Alliance, let alone Yun Banqing. So, if Su Qingshi and the others stayed, it would be very beneficial to the Sword Alliance.

However, he really didn’t want to be separated from them when they’d just been reunited. Especially Yang Nianxue.

Su Qingshi seemed to know what he was thinking and spoke softly, “We don’t want to be separated as well, but we have a stronger desire to help you.”

Yang Ye glanced at them and nodded, “Fine.”

When Yang Ye brought Su Qingshi and the others to the Sword Alliance, countless people started to discuss it animatedly. Even Ye Liuyun and Yun Banqing were astounded. After all, even they had never met Su Qingshi and the others.

“They are my wives”! As soon as Yang Ye introduced them, the entire Sword Alliance was filled with clamorous noise!

Even though they were shocked and bewildered, it didn’t take long for them to accept Su Qingshi and the others.

Besides that Yang Ye delayed his trip because of them, and he stayed with them for around 10 days before he led the others out of Dark Hell Continent on the Void Cloud Shuttle.

Meanwhile, Xue’er looked up at the Void Cloud Shuttle that had transformed into a black dot in the sky and asked, “Mom, will Dad come back?”

Su Qingshi rubbed Xue’er’s head gently and smiled, “He definitely will. Because both of us are here, so this is his home.”

...

On the Void Cloud Shuttle.

Yang Ye sat cross-legged in his room. At this moment, his mind was immersed into the Primordial Pagoda.

The Primordial Pagoda hadn’t just recovered, even the 3rd level had been opened!

Yang Ye issued a command in his heart and arrived at a grey and hazy world. There was a door not too far ahead from him, and it was open.

Yang Ye remained silent on the spot for an instant, and then he walked in.

“How could this be possible?” Yang Ye’s surprised and bewildered voice resounded once he walked through the door.
