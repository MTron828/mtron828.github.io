Chapter 1932 – Sky Stairs!

The holy sword!

Since he arrived at the large universe, Yang Ye had never used the Sovereign of Man’s sword. Because he felt that he didn’t need it anymore.

Yet now, he had to use it!

He had three swords—the Unfettered One’s sword, Spiritbreaker, and the holy sword. While the Unfettered One’s sword was extraordinary, it didn’t belong to him, and it was extraordinary because of the Unfettered One.

Yet now, he definitely didn’t possess strength that was on par with the Unfettered One.

While Spiritbreaker was powerful, he had no doubt that it was definitely not comparable to the short sword she was holding. Moreover, its forte wasn’t its explosive strength, it was its ability to destroy the spirit within things!

Once the other weapon’s spirit was sufficiently strong, Spiritbreaker would be useless against it. Perhaps the whole form of Spiritbreaker wasn’t inferior to her short sword, but it was absolutely not capable of going against her sword in its current state!

The holy sword!

Yang Ye had no choice but to use the holy sword against her!

As Yang Ye’s profound energy surged madly into it, the sun, moon, and stars gradually appeared before the sword. At the same time, the entire sky suddenly dimmed down while countless stars appeared in the air!

Phenomenon!

Everyone here was shocked, including the woman in a white dress. Disbelief filled her eyes.

Yin Hou stared at the sword in Yang Ye’s grasp, “How can this be? What’s the human race’s holy sword doing in his possession?”

The human race’s holy sword!

At this moment, Yin Hou wasn’t the only one who’d recognized it, the white haired old man from before had recognized it too.

The white haired old man stared at Yang Ye. At this moment, he was absolutely curious about Yang Ye’s identity.

In the arena, Yang Ye suddenly soared up into the air and took the holy sword in his right hand. In an instant, countless strands of Stellar Energy surged down from deep within space. Stellar Energy wasn’t the only thing that surged towards him, the energy of the earth was converging madly towards him as well!

Once these energies surged into him, Yang Ye’s body started to tremble.

The holy sword had an ordinary state and an unsealed state.

Its ordinary state was when it was calm, and it was just a sharp sword; but when it was unsealed, it would be like how it was right now. Yang Ye had taken the initiative to draw upon Stellar Energy and the energy of the earth. While it made the holy sword’s strength grow to its peak, his body wasn’t really able to endure all that energy.

Fortunately, his physical body was much stronger than it had been in the past. He’d had to rest for days after using it that day, but that wouldn’t happen again.

The woman in a white dress had an extremely solemn expression on her face as well. She closed her eyes slowly, and then her sword started to tremble. In an instant, a huge amount of Stellar Energy appeared in the sky, and they started to converge towards her sword!

A strange scene appeared!

Two swords were fighting for Stellar Energy!

Yang Ye was about to swing his sword when the holy sword suddenly struggled free of his grasp and flew up higher into the air. It started spinning rapidly, and as it spun, the Stellar Energy in the sky gradually formed a vortex. At the same time, no more Stellar Energy converged towards Star Destroyer.

The Star Destroyer Sword started to spin rapidly, but there was still no Stellar Energy converging towards it.

All the Stellar Energy was converging towards the holy sword.

The woman muttered as she gazed at the holy sword, and her eyes were filled with disbelief, “How can this be possible…?”

The Star Destroyer sword was a precious treasure of the sky race, so it made her wonder what sword she was looking at! After all, it was actually able to suppress the Star Destroyer sword!

Suddenly, Yang Ye grabbed the holy sword. He couldn’t really hold it firmly with one hand, so he used his other hand too.

As he held it with both hands, he raised it up slowly and was about to swing it. However, he suddenly turned around. A small figure had just turned around and was walking away from there.

Yang Ye was slightly stunned, and then everyone watched with astonishment as Yang Ye suddenly put his sword away and left the arena. However, when he arrived where he’d been looking at just now, that area was completely empty!

“Impossible!” Yang Ye frowned. He glanced at the surroundings, but he didn’t see the person he was looking for!

Meanwhile, Yin Hou appeared beside Yang Ye, “What is it?”

Yang Ye slowly closed his eyes, “I saw the person I’m looking for!” Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Yin Hou frowned slightly. She glanced at the surroundings before looking where Yang Ye was standing. A short while passed before she said, “A woman was standing here just now! You’re looking for a woman?”

Yang Ye nodded.

She asked, “Why did she leave instead of meeting you?”

Yang Ye laughed bitterly, “Perhaps I offended her!”

He knew Xiao Qi’s temper well. She was extremely proud. So, she would have definitely not forgotten how he’d misunderstood her that day.

Yin Hou nodded slightly, “Don’t think too much about it. Since she has shown herself and allowed you to notice her, it represents that she doesn’t reject you. Give her some time.”

Yang Ye nodded. He glanced at the surroundings and said, “Sorry, I’ve caused more trouble for you!”

Yin Hou chuckled and said, “Actually, I really hope you’re a member of my shaman race.”

Yang Ye was about to speak when she shook her head, and then she gazed at the white haired old man, “Let’s consider this battle a draw, alright?”

The old man glanced at Yin Hou. In the end, he gazed at Yang Ye, “Who are you? Why is the Sovereign of Man’s sword in your possession?”

Yang Ye replied indifferently, “I refuse to answer that!”

The white haired old man frowned. Meanwhile, Yin Hou said, “Let’s go!”

As soon as she finished speaking, she grabbed Yang Ye’s shoulder and vanished on the spot.

“Investigate his background!” Suddenly, the woman in a white dress spoke abruptly.

The old man hurriedly bowed, “Understood!”

She nodded slightly and vanished on the spot.

At a certain corner of the city, the woman suddenly appeared below the city walls, and there was a young girl in front of her.

Suddenly, the young girl said, “Don’t go looking for trouble with him!”

A wisp of surprise flashed through the woman’s eyes, “You know him?”

The young girl nodded, “You can investigate him, but don’t go looking for trouble with him.”

The woman in a white dress asked, “You’re afraid that I’ll kill him?”

The young girl shook her head, “I’m afraid that he’ll kill you!”

The woman frowned when she heard this, “You think that little of your second sister?”

The young girl walked over to her and said, “It’s because you’re my second sister that I’m telling you all of this. You don’t know his character. Once his terrible temper gets to him, then it doesn’t matter whether he knows who you are, because he’d dare to kill you even if he does know who you are. Moreover, he has the strength to do that!”

The woman spoke in a low voice, “Who is he?!”

The young girl turned around and looked towards the distance. It was in the direction of where Yang Ye had been standing a moment ago. A short while passed before she spoke coldly, “A detestable fellow!”

The woman in a white dress felt speechless.

In the room.

Only Yang Ye and Yin Hou were here.

Yin Hou suddenly said, “We’ll leave in three days from now!”

Yang Ye asked, “Have you finished your business in the Sky Dimension?”

Yin Hou shook her head, “The Sovereign of Sky refused.”

Yang Ye asked, “Why?”

Yin Hou replied, “The conditions he requested were too harsh. Obviously, he was refusing on purpose. In short, it’s not something we have to worry about anymore. We’ll be leaving the Sky Dimension in three days. What about you? Are you going to stay? I don’t recommend that. Because the sky race will definitely not allow it. Moreover, it’s too dangerous for you to stay here on your own!”

Yang Ye said, “I must find her and take her with me!”

He was naturally talking about Zi’er. As for Xiao Qi, she would definitely not go with him.

Yin Hou thought for a moment and nodded slightly, “Alright, do as you wish. Right, there’ll be an event in the sky race on the day after tomorrow. Are you interested in participating?”

“An event?” Yang Ye asked, “What event?”

Yin Hou said, “The Sky Stairs. An event of the sky race that has been held since the ancient times. It’s held every 10 years. The Sky Stairs has a total of 999 stairs. Supposedly, the top achiever will be given extremely generous rewards!”

“Rewards?” Yang Ye asked, “The sky race allows other races to participate?”

Yin Hou smiled, “That’s a story that has to be told from the leader of the sky race, the Sky Emperor. He created the Sky Stairs and said that the geniuses of any race in the universe could participate. So, it became an extremely popular event. Because the geniuses of many races come to the Sky Dimension to participate in the Sky Stairs! Besides to let them gain more experience, the reason I brought Li Wu and the others with me was to make them ascend the Sky Stairs!”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and said, “Let’s see what happens when the time comes!”

Yin Hou nodded slightly, “I suggest that you participate. In any case, you won’t lose anything. Moreover, you may not be aware of it but if you get through the Sky Stairs, you’ll supposedly obtain the acknowledgement of the Sky Emperor.”

Yang Ye asked, “Has no one ever succeeded?”

Yin Hou shook her head, “Even the current Sovereign of Sky merely went up around 960 steps. That’s extraordinary because there’ll probably be no one in the sky race who’ll be able to surpass him in the next 100 years!”

The Sky Stairs!

Yang Ye thought for a moment and said, “I’ll go with you on the day after tomorrow!”
