Chapter 1618 - The Li Clan!

Translator: InVader

Needless to say, the Blood Puppet’s strength was extremely terrifying. As soon as it attacked, the space in an area of numerous kilometers around Yang Ye started to warp and crack open.

Yang Ye’s face was calm as if he’d expected this.

He didn’t do anything. When the Blood Puppet’s palm was just a few dozen centimeters away from his head, a wave of terrifying energy suddenly descended from the sky, and it slammed down upon the Blood Puppet before it could even react.

Bang!

The Blood Puppet flew over 30km away. It twitched on the ground for a while, and then it stood up again. However, its body was covered in fine cracks.

Yang Ye flashed over to the Blood Puppet. As soon as he arrived before it, it slammed its fist at him. However, its fist had only just stretched forward when a mysterious force slammed down upon it again.

Boom!

An explosion resounded, and then it was blasted away again. This time, it wasn’t able to get up again. It just laid there and twitched incessantly.

Yang Ye glanced up into the air. He knew that the Primordial Pagoda had grown stronger. Unfortunately, it couldn’t help him in battle. Otherwise, even Zenith Realm experts would be trash before him!

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts and gazed at the Blood Puppet that was still twitched on the ground. He said, “I understand all of you. After all, no one wants to be controlled by someone else. However, I feel even stronger hate for those who go back on their word. I’ll give you one last chance. Either allow me to control you and stay by my side for three years, or I’ll imprison you forever.”

The Blood Puppet remained silent.

Yang Ye nodded, “Then just stay here!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he turned around and walked away. However, he’d only taken over a dozen steps when the Blood Puppet behind him suddenly spoke, “Will you really let us reincarnate in three years?”

Yang Ye stopped, “Do you have any other choice besides trusting me?”

A moment of silence ensued, and then a string of information surged into Yang Ye’s mind. He closed his eyes slightly and slowly absorbed the information. A short while later, he opened his eyes and walked over to a Blood Puppet. After that, he formed a strange seal with both hands while chanting something. It didn’t take long for a thread of blood to suddenly shoot out from the center of the Blood Puppet’s forehead and enter the center of Yang Ye’s forehead.

A long time passed before Yang Ye felt that a connection had been formed between him and the Blood Puppet. He just had to think it and the vengeful spirits would suffer, and he could destroy the entire Blood Puppet with a single command, causing it to be truly destroyed!

This time, the Blood Puppet hadn’t played any tricks.

In next to no time, Yang Ye did the same for the second Blood Puppet. Just like that, he had two extraordinarily strong Blood Puppets!

Two extraordinary Zenith Realm experts!

Yang Ye glanced at them and said, “I’ll release you in three years!”

One of them suddenly said, “We have another request!”

Yang Ye replied, “Go on!”

“Allow us to take revenge!” The Blood Puppet spoke ferociously, “They didn’t hesitate to annihilate our entire continent to refine us into puppets. We would rather not enter the cycle of reincarnation if we can’t take revenge for that.”

Yang Ye fell silent for an instant before he replied, “Alright!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he turned around and left the Primordial Pagoda.

In the outside world, Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings and vanished on the spot. Even though he had two extraordinary Zenith Realm experts to fight for him, he wouldn’t rashly utilize them. Because he didn’t want to become reliant on them. If he always used them upon encountering danger, then he would never grow himself.

Moreover, these puppets belonged to the Yang Clan’s seventh young master. Once they were exposed, he would definitely have another enemy. Even though he wasn’t afraid of that, it was truly unnecessary to make another enemy at a time like this. So long as he didn’t expose that he had them, then Yang Yan and the seventh young master of the Yang Clan would definitely fight each other.

As far as he was concerned, them fighting against each other was a good thing! After all, he was all alone right now!

Yang Ye sped up through space. At this moment, he seemed like a shooting star shooting through the starry sky. His objective was to figure out his location, and then figure out where the Yang Clan was.

As far as he was concerned, there was no time to be lost on his quest to rescue Little Sky!

A long time later, Yang Ye gained a slight understanding of his current location. He was in a system, but this system had very few planets with life. At the very least, up until this moment in time, he’d only encountered a single planet with life, and it was that planet which the Yang Clan’s seventh young master had slaughtered!

Besides that, all the other planets he saw on the way didn’t even have a trace of life.

The vast starry sky was boundless, and he traveled through it without direction or destination.

Yang Ye gradually started to frown because continuing like this wouldn’t work.

Suddenly, Yang Ye’s eyes lit up because there was a huge planet not too far away from him. The planet was clearly a large world because it was much larger than Sky Sky Continent. Of course, that wasn’t the main point, the main point was that he sensed life on it!

Yang Ye didn’t hesitate to speed up. Right when he was about to enter the planet, an earthen yellow ball of light suddenly shot up from below. It was extremely swift and instantly arrived before him.

Yang Ye was stunned by this. Meanwhile, the tiny vortex within him suddenly spun. In an instant, suction force surged out and sucked the ball of light into the Primordial Pagoda.

“Crap!” Yang Ye’s expression changed and was about to flee. But it was too late. A man with a silver spear in his grasp appeared in front of Yang Ye. The man was about to speak when a ray of light from a saber suddenly appeared from below him. After that, a young man with a saber appeared here.

The man with a saber was a little over 20, wore green clothes, and had slightly disheveled hair. His hair wasn’t the only thing in a mess, his robe was in rags as well. He seemed like a beggar.

The man with a saber glanced at the spear-wielding man, and then he glanced at Yang Ye. Suddenly, he chuckled, “Haha! Li Tianjiu, based on how terrible you look, I’m sure that Earth Spirit didn’t fall into your hands, right? Haha!”

A wisp of gloominess flashed through the spear-wielding man’s eyes, “Lu Lige, do you want to die?!”

“Can you kill me?” The man called Lu Lige had a wisp of disdain on the corners of his mouth, “Li Tianjiu, I can’t kill you, but you can’t kill me too.”

As he spoke, he turned to look at Yang Ye, “Brother, the treasure you just obtained is the Earth Spirit. Tsk, tsk. It’s a really precious treasure. This Brother Li of ours spent almost a year secretly extracting it from the world below us. So, you’ve made a killing this time.”

Yang Ye was about to speak when a terrifying strand of intent locked onto him. Yang Ye’s expression changed, and he turned to look at the spear-wielding man!

Returnal Rank spear intent!

Yang Ye hadn’t expected Li Tianjiu to actually possess Returnal Rank spear intent. It had really exceeded his expectations a little.

Li Tianjiu stared at Yang Ye, “I’ll only say this once! Hand it over!”

Yang Ye was about to speak when another strand of intent appeared around him.

Yang Ye’s expression changed again because it was Returnal Rank saber intent!

Yang Ye glanced at Lu Lige and Li Tianjiu. Milky Way System is really full of experts!

Meanwhile, Lu Lige gazed at Yang Ye and chuckled, “Brother, don’t be afraid. I’ll help you if he attacks you!”

Yang Ye sized up Lu Lige and asked, “Why?”

“Why?” Lu Lige smiled, “Because I want to. So long as it makes Li Tianjiu suffer, I’m willing to do it! Haha!”

Yang Ye nodded. He was about to speak when the spear-wielding man suddenly vanished on the spot. He was in front of Yang Ye when his figure appeared again, and then the tip of his spear arrived before Yang Ye’s forehead.

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly. He clenched his right fist and was about to attack. However, a ray of saber energy suddenly tore through the air. It was extremely swift and instantly struck the tip of Li Tianjiu’s spear.

Bang!

The spear was pushed to the side and passed right beside Yang Ye’s ear. Suddenly, Yang Ye shot forward, and then he slammed his fist at Li Tianjiu.

A cold glow flashed through Li Tianjiu’s eyes. His expression remained calm as it twisted his wrist, and he raised his spear in front of himself.

Bang!

Li Tianjiu was pushed around 300m back.

“Eh!” Lu Lige was visibly surprised, “Brother, you’re a body refiner?”

Yang Ye nodded. He was just about to speak when a spear tore through the air towards Yang Ye. Yang Ye instinctively raised his fist and slammed it forward.

Bang!

An explosion resounded, and then Yang Ye was pushed 300m back!

Yang Ye looked down at his fist, and he noticed that it had cracked open.

“Hehe!” Meanwhile, Lu Lige chuckled, “Brother, you can’t look down on this great Young Master Li. He’s a genius of the Li Clan, and he’s ranked in the top three within the Li Clan. Moreover, he has killed a Zenith Realm expert on his own.”

“The Li Clan!” Yang Ye was slightly stunned, and then he asked, “Do you know the Yang Clan?”

“The Yang Clan?” Lu Lige said, “Of course. That’s a clan of madmen.” He sized up Yang Ye and continued, “Are you from the Yang Clan?” Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Li Tianjiu who was about to attack had immediately stopped when he heard Lu Lige, “You’re from the Yang Clan?”

Yang Ye remained silent for a moment. Suddenly, he pointed at Li Tianjiu and shouted, “Li Tianjiu, I’m a subordinate of the Yang Clan’s Third Young Master, Yang Yan! If you dare to touch me, my Young Master will definitely annihilate your Li Clan!”
