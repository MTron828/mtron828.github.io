Chapter 2755 – The Universe!

Get help!

Ding Shaoyao gazed at Yang Ye, “Are you serious?”

Yang Ye grinned, “What do you think?”

She smiled, “You’re not someone who’s fond of entrusting your hopes to others. You’re definitely looking for him for some other reason, right?”

Yang Ye glanced at her and had a rather complicated expression on his face.

She still knew him that well!

But at most times, he couldn’t really see through her!

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts and nodded slightly, “Getting his help isn’t my only objective. I want to ask him about something. Of course, if he’s willing to help for a while, that would be great too.”

He suddenly chuckled at this point.

His relationship with the Unfettered One was actually quite complicated.

However, they weren’t enemies. It was just their Sword Daos which were complete opposites.

Ding Shaoyao said, “Your Sword Dao is at a bottleneck!”

Yang Ye gave her a thumbs up because she was as monstrous as always!

A bottleneck!

After he attained the peak of the Destiny Realm, Yang Ye’s Sword Dao had actually reached his limits too. Besides that, at that moment, he’d gained a clear understanding of how the Sword Precursor was the most suitable sword for him. Both he and the Sword Precursor were at their own limits, and they just had to take another step forward to attain the Ordinary Sword Realm.

Now, he was at the peak of the mountain, and he knew that he could go further, but there was no path before him!

At this moment, he finally understood why the Unfettered One kept challenging experts all along the way.

After arriving at an extreme, only endless battles could help him improve!

Now, the person he wanted to challenge the most was the Unfettered One.

Because the Unfettered One was a sword cultivator, and besides the strongest form of Destiny and her other three forms, he was the only other sword cultivator whose Sword Dao was superior to Yang Ye.

As for why he didn’t go looking for the other three forms of Destiny, it was because the Unfettered One’s Sword Dao was superior to them.

Of course, the strongest form of Destiny was an option too.

However, he was very well aware that if he went to her at his current level of strength, he wouldn’t be seeking improvement, he would be seeking death.

Ding Shaoyao fell silent for a short while and nodded, “I’ll give the orders for them to search for the Unfettered One. However, he’s too strong, so I’m afraid my people will…”

Yang Ye replied softly, “If you find him, tell him I’m looking for him.”

Ding Shaoyao nodded, “I see!”

She gazed at Yang Ye and continued, “I’m sure you have something else to say to me, right?”

Yang Ye smiled, “Shaoyao, sometimes you really feel quite terrifying!”

She grinned, “I should be proud to be able to instill fear in you!”

Yang Ye shook his head and smiled before speaking seriously, “The Council of Elders and the Guardians of the Universe will be out in the open, and I need your people to remain in the shadows! Do you understand what I mean?”

Ding Shaoyao spoke softly, “To monitor them?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “To supervise them! And you should let them know of your existence and what you’re doing.”

Ding Shaoyao nodded slightly, “I understand. Don’t worry, I’ll deal with the relationship between us, the Council of Elders, and the other powers from all over the universe!”

Yang Ye said, “I naturally have nothing to worry about when you’re doing it. However, for safety’s sake, I’ll ask the Emperor Corpse, Cang Mu, and Sha Ji to follow you. I’m afraid they will ignore you if you can’t display sufficient strength.”

Ding Shaoyao smiled, “I didn’t realize you’d learned the art of balance!

Balance between all the powers!

Because he absolutely couldn’t allow one to be superior to the others. Once that happened, problems may arise!

After telling Ding Shaoyao everything that was necessary, she left. She was undoubtedly the busiest person here right now.

Once she left, Yang Ye returned to the Primordial Pagoda.Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

As soon as he entered the pagoda, Snowy ran over to him with a sword in her paws!

Burial!

Yang Ye took it, and it trembled slightly before a sword howl resounded through the sky.

Yang Ye was quite shocked because it was really too sharp! If it fell into a suitable person’s hands, it would be absolutely formidable. In the past, he would definitely train with this sword. Yet now, he had the Sword Precursor.

Of course, he could still use this sword!

Yang Ye waved his right hand, and the Sword Gourd flew over to his waist. He tapped it, and Burial immediately shot into the Sword Gourd.

A flying sword!

He’d decided to use Burial as a flying sword. Using it at a critical moment could definitely take his opponents by surprise!

After all, it was so sharp that only a few swords in the entire universe could resist it!

The Ordinary Sword, Justice, and Destiny’s sword when all four of them were merged into one!

Yang Ye rubbed Snowy’s little head and brought her over to Erya’s abode. At this moment, Erya was daydreaming on a rock.

She turned around to look at them upon sensing their arrival. Erya jumped off the rock, went over to them, and cracked a smile, “Big Brother Yang!”

Yang Ye rubbed her head, or to be more precise, her black horns!

Erya didn’t react to it. Perhaps only Yang Ye and Snowy were allowed to touch her horns in the entire world!

Those horns were the strongest part of her, but they were also her greatest weakness.

However, it was a weakness which wasn’t really a weakness. Because her greatest weakness just happened to be the strongest part of her.

The only way to defeat her was to defeat her in a head-on collision!

Yang Ye said, “Erya, how do you feel after devouring Heng Wangu’s soul?”

Erya cracked a smile, “His soul was extremely strong. I felt my strength rise tremendously. If I encounter someone like him again, I can blast that person to the Four Dimensional Universe with one punch!”

Yang Ye roared with laughter, “Amazing, truly amazing!”

Snowy blinked and sneakily touched Erya’s horns. Her horns were smooth as glass and comfortable to the touch. Erya refused to let her get away with it and toucher her head in response, and then it didn’t take long for the two little fellows to start playing again!

Both of them were like children!

Yang Ye shook his head, smiled, and left.

He went to the cultivation room, and only An Nanjing was there.

She gazed at him, and he spoke softly, “Are you alright?”

Both An Nanjing and him had actually suffered serious injuries during their battle with the mysterious expert.

She shook her head, “Snowy!”

Yang Ye couldn’t help but smile. It was true. So long as they didn’t die, they could recover swiftly while they had Snowy with them!

An Nanjing asked, “How do you feel?”

Yang Ye smiled, “I feel many things!”

Even though they hadn’t won the battle against the mysterious expert, they’d comprehended many things!

Their flaws!

At most times, it was failure that allowed someone to realize their flaws. As for those who couldn’t fail, it was very difficult for them to improve themselves.

Yang Ye sat down cross-legged and started recalling the battle against the mysterious expert!

Meanwhile, An Nanjing gradually closed her eyes as well.

Cultivating!

As far as they were concerned, they didn’t want to waste even a moment of their time.

Eternal Kingdom.

Now, Paradise City had a new name, Universe City. As its name implied, it was a city owned by the entire universe. The powers throughout the universe could be found within the city, and it could be said that Universe City had become the hub of the entire Three Dimensional Universe. It was a place linked to the development of the entire universe and the countless smaller worlds within it.

Moreover, the birth of Universe City and the balance between the various powers allowed the once desolate Eternal Kingdom to gradually recover its former glory.

Besides that, the world beyond Eternal Kingdom gradually started to recover its spirit energy. Because around 30 Destiny Realm experts from all over the universe were here, so practically no one dared to cause trouble!

As for these powers, they had their own interests in everything, so they wouldn’t cause trouble. Of course, they didn’t dare to either.

Because there were around 20 Guardians of the Universe ceaselessly patrolling Eternal Kingdom and the worlds around it. Besides that, there was the Council of Elders above them, and above that council was Yang Ye!

It could be said that the entire Three Dimensional Universe was gradually entering a new form of order!

A brand new order!

Meanwhile, in an unknown world. This world was devoid of spirit energy, and it was a world on the verge of destruction.

In a cave of lava, endless dark energy was flowing out of it.

There was a saber cultivator by the entrance to the cave!

It was Zuo Mu!

A soul was floating by his side!

It was Emperor Li’s soul!

At this moment, Emperor Li was still in the form of a soul.

Besides that, there were a few more experts in the surroundings. They were the experts from the End World who’d escaped the battle!

Emperor Li glanced at the lava cave, “Is he still holding back?”

Zuo Mu replied softly, “His enemy is Destiny!”

Emperor Li laughed coldly, “Destiny? If he can’t even deal with Yang Ye, how can he possibly deal with Destiny?”

Zuo Mu fell silent.

Emperor Li continued, “Yang Ye has gained enough strength now. If I’m being honest, neither of us are a match for him in single combat. Moreover, he has that young girl, the Evil Progenitor, and that woman with the Martial God Physique. Our overall strength cannot compete with them anymore.”

Zuo Mu shook his head.

His views on this had always been similar to Heng Wangu, and it was to do everything they could to annihilate Yang Ye.

Unfortunately, the mysterious expert in the cave had different thoughts!

Now, they were suffering for that decision!

A flame soundlessly appeared in the cave and just floated there.

Besides that, there was a woman at the side, and she had young leaves on her head!

It was Shu Wubian!

She glanced at the mysterious expert and said, “Your sword is gone.”

The mysterious expert fell silent for a moment and replied, “The Good Sprite will make the sword even more perfect!”

Shu Wubian replied indifferently, “You gave it to him on purpose!”

The mysterious expert replied, “What else did you expect? Do you think he could take my sword? He…”

Suddenly, he stopped speaking at this point, and then he howled with fury, “Dammit! She actually destroyed its sprite. Dammit! Argh! Damn Good Sprite! I’ll destroy you! I’ll obliterate you! Ahh!!”
