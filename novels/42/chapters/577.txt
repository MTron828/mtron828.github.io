100,000 years! Yang Ye gasped. How terrifying would it be to be restrained at the same spot for 100,000 years? No wonder she had that much resentment. A normal person would have probably gone mad and possess a warped personality after being restrained for 100,000 years, right?

“I felt the situation was bad at that time. But I couldn’t do anything because both my master and those experts weren’t existences that I could resist. So, I had no other choice but to secretly separate a portion of my consciousness and store it within my sheath. After that, I fled the Daemon Catacombs with the hope of finding a way to rescue my main body. But I never imagined that this would go on for 100,000 years!” said the Sword Spirit.

Yang Ye pondered deeply for a moment before he said, “Firstly, you really have my sympathies. However, you should be clearly aware that even the Sword Sect’s Founding Ancestor hadn’t been able to retrieve your main body. Don’t you think that sending me over would be equivalent to sending me to my death? You’ve helped me a great deal, and I’m not an ungrateful person. I’ll definitely rescue your main body if I possess sufficient strength in the future, alright?”

“My time is running out....” The Sword Spirit spoke in a low voice. “Once those defiant profounders break through the seal, the first thing they do would definitely be to destroy my main body’s consciousness. At that time, I wouldn’t be myself anymore.”

Yang Ye laughed bitterly and said, “You have to understand that we’ll be walking towards our graves if we head over there right now!”

The Sword Spirit shook her head and said, “When I said that the Sword Sect’s Founding Ancestor was unable to save me, I was lying to you. It wasn’t that he couldn’t save me, he chose not to. Because if he were to have saved me all those years ago, then the seal would have definitely collapsed and countless defiant profounders would have swarmed out from within it. At that time, even he wasn’t able to stop those defiant profounders, so he’d chosen not to rescue me!”

So that was why! Yang Ye fell silent for a long time before he said, “Even if we do save your main body, what would we do about those defiant profounders? How would I deal with them? Truthfully speaking, I really want to help you if I can because helping you is equivalent to helping me. However, you should be aware that I can’t even go against Monarch Realm experts, let alone Half-Saints. But the weakest amongst them are at the Half-Saint Realm....”

She said, “In the past, I hoped that you would grow completely into an expert before you head over to rescue my main body. But time is really running out now. Even if you don’t save my main body, those defiant profounders will still emerge from the seal. The only difference is that you’ll have a chance to obtain my main body if we head over there. Conversely, I would vanish from the face of this world if we don’t rescue my main body while those defiant profounders would still emerge from within the seal!”

“Looks like I have no other choice!” Yang Ye laughed bitterly.

“We have to do it as soon as possible!” said the Sword Spirit in a low voice.

Yang Ye nodded.

Yang Ye had just left Death Abyss when he received a transmission talisman from Su Qingshi. A wisp of ghastly killing intent arose in Yang Ye’s eyes when he looked through it because Luo Jun had actually received assistance from the Oceanic Clans in the Ocean of Anarchy. So, Luo Jun’s army had already landed on the other side of the Ocean of Anarchy, and the army had arrived before Ancient Domain City.

At this moment, Ancient Domain City was in a state of emergency!

Yang Ye’s figure flashed and rushed towards Ancient Domain City with Corpse Ancestor. The reason he hadn’t returned to the southern territory was because Ding Shaoyao had already ordered the southern territory’s army to gather and rush to Ancient Domain City once she found out that Luo Jun’s army had arrived at the southern territory. Of course, this decision was supported by both the Founding Emperor and Beast Emperor.

At this moment, practically all the elites of the southern territory were rushing towards Ancient Domain City. Especially the Grand Myriad Mountains. When he flew past the Grand Myriad Mountains, Yang Ye noticed that a dense wave of Darkbeasts were rushing towards Ancient Domain City.

The mountains were quaking!

In the beginning, the Founding Emperor and Beast Emperor weren’t that resolved to fight the Exalted Han Empire until the death because the gap between both sides was truly too huge. Perhaps they would have a chance if they used the Grand Myriad Mountains as the border that they protected with all their strength. However, the southern territory didn’t have any chance at success if it was a frontal collision between the two armies. However, they didn’t hesitate any longer when they heard that Yang Ye was alive and had even attained the fifth rank of the Exalt Realm!

Forcefully protecting a border would fail sooner or later, but fighting a battle until death would provide them with a chance at success. At the very least, they could make the Exalted Han Empire pay a horrible price even if they failed!

...

Ancient Domain City.

It was a natural barrier before the southern territory, and Luo Jun’s army would have to travel through a detour of at least 5,000km through the east or west of the city in order to bypass it and arrive at the southern territory. But Luo Jun wouldn’t choose any one of them no matter what because both of them were covered in mountains that towered into the sky, all sorts of rough terrain, and countless dangerous swamps.

Besides Exalt Realm experts, even Spirit Realm experts wouldn’t be able to pass through from there. So, he could only pass through Ancient Domain City!

The City Governor’s Estate of Ancient Domain City.

Qin Xiyue from the Grand Qin Empire, Xiao Yuxi and Ding Shaoyao from the Sword Sect, and a rugged and robust man from the Darkbeast Empire were seated within the room. Besides them, Lu Jianyao was representing the City Governor’s Estate.

“Based on our preliminary estimations, the Exalted Han Empire has brought at least 15,000 Exalt Realm experts, around 600,000 Spirit Realm experts, and countless profounders at the King Realm. They are practically all the elites of the central territory.” Ding Shaoyao spoke slowly, “On the other hand, we have less than 5,000 Exalt Realm experts in total. As for Spirit Realm experts, we only have around 200,000, whereas, the amount of King Realm profounders we possess don’t even amount to 5% of the King Realm experts possessed by the Exalted Han Empire!”

The expressions of everyone in this room became slightly unsightly when they heard Ding Shaoyao because the gap in their strengths was truly too huge.

Ding Shaoyao said, “However, we have such a natural barrier like Ancient Domain City, so we can persist for some time if we only defend and avoid attacking. However, all of you should be aware that staying on the defense isn’t a long term plan. We have to repulse Luo Jun over and over again. So long as that continues for a long time, then those sects and clans of the central territory would definitely arouse the intent to retreat, and our opportunity would appear when there’s a divergence of opinion amongst them!”

Qin Xiyue said, “But the problem is whether we can defend the city until that happens!”

Ding Shaoyao grinned and said, “That isn’t difficult. The difficult part is how to avoid any divergence of opinion amongst us. I believe that all the powers that you respectively represent have resolved to fight the Exalted Han Empire until the death. However, I’d like to know if those clans and smaller sects which have sided with you feel the same?”

The robust man from the Darkbeast Empire stated, “There are no treacherous clans amongst the Darkbeasts of my Darkbeast Empire!”

The others remained silent, especially Qin Xiyue. There were countless clans and small powers that had sought the Grand Qin Empire’s protector. Even though they’d declared their support for the empire now, no one could guarantee that their decision wouldn’t change! Qin Xiyue wasn’t confident in them at all. Because the Grand Qin Empire had already secretly annihilated some clans that had ill intent towards the empire!

Meanwhile, Ding Shaoyao said, “Besides going against the Exalted Han Empire, we have to be careful of the powers on our side as well. Because once Luo Jun is able to attack us from both the inside and outside, then it would definitely be a calamity for us. Do all of you think that Luo Jun will spare us if he breaks through the city? He wouldn’t! Because the entire human world would be under his command once he kills us! So, please be careful of those clans and powers that have joined your side. Once you notice that they have ill intent, then please annihilate them regardless of whether you have sufficient proof!”

“That would probably cause many clans and powers to panic and arouse aversion by doing that!” Qin Xiyue frowned.

“We’re in harsh times now, so we can only use harsh methods!” said Ding Shaoyao.

Right at this moment, a fluctuation appeared in the space before her, and then Ding Shaoyao frowned.

“What’s wrong?” asked Qin Xiyue.

Ding Shaoyao stood up, looked towards the north, and said in a heavy voice. “According to a report from our scouts, two men and one woman wearing strange clothes appeared amidst Luo Jun’s army, and then Luo Jun’s army stopped 50m away from the city.”

“What do you mean?” asked Lu Jianyao.

Ding Shaoyao said, “They did a single thing after they arrived amidst Luo Jun’s army. They killed over a dozen Exalt Realm experts within the army.”

“That’s a good thing!” Lu Jianyao said, “It proves that they are his enemies!”

Ding Shaoyao shook her head and said, “Luo Jun didn’t dare counterattack after they killed those Exalt Realm experts, and he even invited them into his dwellings. According to the reports from our scouts, they are wearing very strange clothing, and they don’t seem to be clothes from any one of the territories throughout Profounder Continent. Moreover, the three of them were extremely arrogant... Alas, I hope other issues don’t arise because of this.”

...

Luo Jun’s dwellings.

“You’re the Mortal Emperor of this era?” A man whose clothes were covered in all sorts of strange symbols gazed at Luo Jun as he spoke. Another man with similar clothing and a woman who wore a crystal blue dress were standing by his side.

“How audacious!” Meanwhile, a soldier within Luo Jun’s dwellings shouted furiously. However, he hadn’t even finished speaking when that man flicked his finger, and then a strange symbol shot forward. That soldier’s expression changed, and he hurriedly created a spatial barrier before himself. However, that symbol wasn’t affected by the spatial barrier at all, and it directly shot into his body.

Bang!

That fifth rank Exalt Realm expert’s body suddenly exploded apart, and then the symbol flew back into the man’s hand.

The expressions of everyone here changed while Luo Jun’s expression grew unsightly to the extreme. The reason he’d allowed them to enter his dwellings was because he felt that they were extremely strong and mysterious, so he wanted to recruit them. But he hadn’t expected that they would completely disregard him and kill his subordinates right before him!

Right when everyone within here was about to swarm that group of 3 experts, the man withdrew a command token and shook it before Luo Jun’s eyes.

Luo Jun frowned, and then he spoke with a ferocious voice upon laying eyes on the command token. “No one can save all of you!”

However, Luo Tian suddenly appeared before them, and he revealed a complicated and shocked expression when he saw the command token. He said, “The Heaven Dao Command Token.... I never expected that it actually exists.... All of you are from the Hallowed Grounds....”
