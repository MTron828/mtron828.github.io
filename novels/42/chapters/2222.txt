Chapter 2223 – The Primordial Axe of Creation!

The Sword Dao?

There were too many sword cultivators and too many descriptions.

It was chaos!

Of course, it wasn’t that their theory was incorrect, it was that Yang Ye had his own understanding of it. In the past, he wasn’t very firm on it, and he was a little lost. So, he’d asked that question to the Bodhi Tree.

Now, after he’d witnessed the Sword Dao of countless, he noticed that all of it wasn’t the Sword Dao which he wanted.

The sword!

The sword was used to kill!

It was the simplest explanation, and it was the only explanation for Yang Ye.

So, while he’d gained insight into countless Sword Dao, he still stuck firmly to his own understanding of it!

Once Yang Ye left, An Nanjing went to the Bodhi Tree.

She gazed at it for a long time before she sat down slowly, and it didn’t take long for her to ask something before gradually closing her eyes.

Snowy blinked, gazed at the Bodhi Tree, and then started waving her paws.

What’s the most tastiest thing?

That was Snowy’s question.

The Bodhi Tree had no response for her.

…

Yang Ye left the Primordial Pagoda, and the Universe Sprite greeted him.

Yang Ye asked, “Where are you going now?”

The Universe Sprite replied with a question, “Why?”

He thought for a moment and said, “If you have nowhere else to go, just stay in Void Spirit Continent. Firstly, we’ll be able to take care of each other. Secondly, you can help me teach Snowy. I’m sure you’ve noticed that she hasn’t discovered many of her abilities, and I think that you can help her do that.”

She was an extraordinary expert, so he naturally had to try and bring her over to his side. If she was willing to stay in Void Spirit Continent, then it would definitely be very good news for him and the continent as a whole. Most importantly, she was the Universe Sprite, Snowy’s kin, so Snowy would definitely be able to grow tremendously with her help.

Snowy!

The Universe Sprite fell silent.

She had planned to directly refuse Yang Ye’s suggestion because she didn’t like living with others. However, she hesitated when she heard him mention Snowy.

The Sprite Lord!

Yet now, the Sprite Lord was like a cute pet.

It wasn’t something she wanted to see! Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

She thought for a long time and nodded, “Alright!”

Yang Ye was delighted when he heard this. Now that the Universe Sprite was joining them, it was no different than obtaining an extremely powerful expert on their side!

Meanwhile, the Universe Sprite said, “Come, let me take you to another place!”

Yang Ye was about to ask when she vanished on the spot.

Yang Ye shook his head and followed her.

…

This time, while the large universe had gained temporary peace with the retreat of the undying race, it was quite horrifying peace. Because besides the God Realm and Void Spirit Continent, practically everywhere else had fallen.

Countless had died or were in hiding!

The entire large universe was filled with fear!

Fear toward the undying race!

However, some experts of the large universe, those at the Major Zen Realm or above, had surrendered to the undying race.

Or to be more precise, many had chosen to surrender.

Even an ant wanted to live, let alone a person? If the undying race didn’t refuse experts below the Major Zen Realm, perhaps 90% of all the living beings in the large universe would have chosen to surrender!

…

Yang Ye followed the Universe Sprite through space, and it didn’t take long for her to stop.

Yang Ye frowned immediately because he’d been here in the past!

It was the continent that the Initial Civilization had resided on, and he remembered that there was a mysterious altar here.

The Universe Sprite suddenly asked, “You’re been here?”

Yang Ye nodded.

The Universe Sprite spoke softly, “Then you should be aware of what this place is.”

Yang Ye replied, “The Initial Civilization!”

She nodded, “It’s the base camp of the Initial Civilization. Do you know why the undying race wants experts at the Major Zen Realm or above?”

Yang Ye asked, “Why?”

The Universe Sprite replied indifferently, “The large universe is a natural formation, and it can take the entire large universe to the universe which the Initial Civilization went to. The undying race’s goal is the universe that the Initial Civilization went to. Or perhaps their goal is the Initial Civilization. But the undying race’s strength alone isn’t sufficient to activate it. Thus, they intend to rely on the experts of our large universe, and that’s why they are allowing others to surrender!”

I see! Yang Ye spoke solemnly, “Why do they want to go looking for the Initial Civilization?”

The Universe Sprite gazed at Yang Ye, “To conquer and plunder!”

Yang Ye frowned slightly, “They’re that confident? They think they can defeat the initial civilization?”

“They are!” The Universe Sprite spoke softly, “The army they’ve revealed is probably just the tip of the iceberg, and their ambition doesn’t stop at the large universe. This large universe can’t satisfy them at all. So, their target is the Initial Civilization. That’s their next objective!”

She shook her head at this point, “The universe gave birth to all things, yet everyone throughout the boundless universe is doing the same thing—plundering. Everyone is plundering. Once they finish plundering this place, they will go to the next. However, are these universes really endless? What goes around, comes around. They will one day suffer for their own selfishness!”

Yang Ye shook his head slightly and didn’t say anything.

It was difficult to determine who was right or wrong in this matter, and he didn’t want to waste time on it!

The Universe Sprite clearly didn’t want to waste time on it either, and she immediately walked off into the distance.

Yang Ye followed her.

It didn’t take long for them to enter the ruins, but Yang Ye stopped at this moment.

She asked, “What is it?”

Yang Ye spoke solemnly, “I’m sure you’re aware of the abandoned altar in the city, right?”

She nodded, “I am! Why?”

Yang Ye said, “Don’t you think that there’s something off about it?”

The Universe Sprite said, “I’ve taken a look at it, and there is something off about it. Why? Do you know something?”

Yang Ye nodded, “It’s dangerous. I’ve been here, and I encountered danger at that time. I think that some sort of powerful being is in there.”

She said, “We’re not going there. Of course, even if we do, with the strength we possess, only a few in this world can kill us!”

Yang Ye spoke softly, “It’s best to be careful.”

She said, “What? Since when have you, Yang Ye, become so careful?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “Confidence isn’t conceit. We can be confident, but we cannot be conceited. Alright, forget that, let’s go!”

Yang Ye wasn’t afraid of anything, but it didn’t represent that he would act conceitedly.

The Universe Sprite glanced at him and walked away.

She led Yang Ye deep into the city until they reached a damaged pavilion. There was a huge blue circle at its center.

She formed a seal with both hands, and then it trembled before a figure appeared there.

The figure was quite blurry and impossible to discern, only a rough outline could be discerned!

Yang Ye asked, “Someone from the Initial Civilization?”

She replied, “An Initial, they call themselves the initial race!”

The initial race!

Yang Ye was about to speak when the Initial suddenly spoke, “Universe Sprite?”

She nodded slightly, “Sorry for disturbing you!”

The Initial said, “Why have you come here?”

She replied, “Do you know about the undying race?”

“The undying race!” The Initial spoke solemnly, “What? They are here in this universe?”

The Universe Sprite nodded.

The Initial fell silent.

The Universe Sprite spoke softly, “Their current goal is this large universe, and it’s about to fall completely to them. But their goal is far beyond this large universe. According to my knowledge, their next object is your initial race. It’s very likely that they’ll be activating the formation here and going to where all of you are.”

The Initial asked, “What are you trying to say?”

The Universe Sprite replied, “If the undying race really does get there, then their formidable strength will definitely be a calamity for your race, right?”

The Initial replied with a question, “Do you think we would fear them?”

The Universe Sprite fell silent.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly said, “I don’t know if you fear them, but I do know that they don’t fear you. Since they don’t, it represents that they may know of your strength. But how much do you know about the undying race?”

The Initial replied with a question, “How much do you know about my initial race?”

Yang Ye smiled, “Looks like what we’re doing isn’t necessary. Since the initial race is that confident, we’ll be leaving.”

Yang Ye turned around and walked away, and the Universe Sprite followed him.

However, the Initial suddenly said, “Wait.”

Yang Ye stopped, “What?”

The Initial said, “You clearly want us to step forward and deal with the undying race. However, we refuse to interfere in the enmity between this large universe and the undying race. Moreover, the price to teleport over here is too great. So, we can’t interfere at all. However…”

Yang Ye said, “Hmm?”

The Initial continued, “There’s a natural demonic treasure beneath this city, and our initial race didn’t take it with us all those years ago. You can give it a try. If you can obtain it, it may be of help to you.”

Yang Ye asked, “Why didn’t you take it?”

“We couldn’t!” The Initial continued, “All those years ago, the world had just been formed, and it gave birth to 10 divine treasures. Five great Sacred Artifacts and five great Demonic Artifacts. My race took five of them, and we were unable to take the other five with us due to certain special reasons. The demonic treasure below is one of them. Hmm, I sense three of them with you. The Primordial Pagoda of Nature, the Bodhi Tree of Fortune, the Primordial…”

Yang Ye hurriedly asked, “The Primordial what?”

The Initial fell silent for a moment and said, “The Primordial Axe of Creation. It was too strong, so my race used the Primordial Pagoda of Nature, the other five divine treasures, and a few supreme experts to suppress it! Unfortunately, it managed to take this pagoda and escape.”

The Primordial Axe of Creation!
