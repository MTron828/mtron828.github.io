Chapter 2381 – Like Me!

As soon as she said those words, she stretched out her hand to the right and clenched it.

In an instant, an invisible spirit energy barrier appeared over 1km to Yang Ye and Nanli Meng’s right, and it overlapped into an extremely thick wall!

Meanwhile, Nanli Meng suddenly grabbed Yang Ye’s shoulder and brought him along as she vanished into the distance.

Yang Ye noticed that she had an extremely solemn expression on her face.

Over 1km away, a huge palm was shooting in their direction, and it didn’t take long for it to arrive before the barriers that the Sprite Progenitor had created. However, with just a light wave, the barrier collapsed in an instant.

Meanwhile, Nanli Meng seemed to have sensed something. She stopped and turned around.

At this moment, both of them saw the hand.

Nanli Meng’s eyes narrowed slightly, and then a golden leaf appeared in her grasp. An instant later, it transformed into a ray of golden light that shot into the sky.

Golden light filled the sky!

Countless rays of golden light rippled toward the hand like waves!

The hand shook slightly, and then a voice resounded, “Ants!”

The hand was waved lightly once the voice resounded.

It was like the autumn breeze sweeping away the leaves, and the golden light in the sky instantly vanished without a trace.

Nanli Meng’s face fell from the sight of this. The enemy’s strength far surpassed her expectations. Meanwhile, Yang Ye took a step forward, and then the sword formation beneath Void Mountain started to tremble!

“How laughable!” Suddenly, a voice resounded, and then a chair appeared in the sky. An instant later, a wave of powerful pressure enveloped Yang Ye and Nanli Meng.

Suffocating!

Yang Ye and Nanli Meng exchanged glances, and then she laughed bitterly, “We’re probably dead this time! I never expected that I would die by a man’s side!”

Yang Ye looked up at the chair in the sky while he tightened his grip on the Sword Precursor.

He knew that both of them were no match for the expert on that chair.

However, even if he was no match for that person, he planned to fight!

The man on the chair suddenly said, “I didn’t expect a Sprite Progenitor to appear in Eternal Border and not Eternal Kingdom after these countless years. Looks like the heavens do not stand with Eternal Kingdom anymore.”

Yang Ye spoke solemnly, “You’re from the desolate race?”

The man smiled, “What? You plan to beg for mercy?”

Yang Ye chuckled, “Would you spare us?”

“Yes!” The man continued, “If you kneel down and beg me, I can let both you and that woman leave. As far as I’m concerned, both of you are so weak that I’m not interested in you at all!”

Yang Ye was about to speak when a ray of sword energy shot through the sky and shot straight at the man.

The man’s eyes narrowed slightly, and he clenched his right fist before slamming it at the sword energy.

The sword energy arrived!

Hiss!

It seemed like something was torn open in the sky, and the entire sky fell silent.

Meanwhile, a sword cultivator in a cloud white robe appeared in the sky.

He walked over to the chair and looked the man in the eyes, “The strong should not act like you.”

A smile curled up on the corners of the man’s mouth, “Then how do you think the strong should act?”

He thought for a moment and replied, “Like me!”

“HAHA!” The man on the chair suddenly roared with laughter, “What a sentiment! Sword cultivator, I’ll remember this, and I’ll come for your head soon!”

As soon as he finished speaking, his figure and the chair gradually turned ethereal.

Right when he was about to completely vanish, the sword cultivator before him nodded, “I’ll be waiting!”

The man and the chair vanished completely.

The sword cultivator turned around, and then he was in front of Yang Ye and Nanli Meng. His gaze descended onto Yang Ye, “Can we have a talk?”

Yang Ye smiled, “Of course!”

Nanli Meng said, “I’ll wait for you over there!”

She was about to leave once she finished speaking, but the sword cultivator suddenly said, “Your Dao isn’t bad!”

Her figure stiffened, and then she gazed at him, “Really?”FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

He grinned, “There are a myriad of Daos, and all of them are extraordinary, Of course, it depends on the person.”

Nanli Meng smiled, “Can I record you?”

He glanced at the thick scroll in her grasp. Suddenly, he flicked a ray of sword energy into it, and a ray of sword energy appeared at the end of the scroll!

Nanli Meng bowed slightly to him, “Thank you!”

She glanced at Yang Ye, and then she turned around and left.

The sword cultivator gazed at Yang Ye, “Walk with me!”

Yang Ye nodded.

Both sword cultivators walked off to the side. Meanwhile, Snowy kept sizing up the sword cultivator while standing on Yang Ye’s shoulder.

The sword cultivator said, “What do you think someone truly strong is like?”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and replied, “People like us!”

The sword cultivator shook his head and smiled. He looked down at his sword, and Yang Ye’s gaze descended upon it as well. The sword trembled, and then it left its sheath and went over to Yang Ye.

Yang Ye stretched out his hand and took it, and the sword did not resist.

It was the sword the Unfettered One had destroyed all those years ago, the same sword Yang Ye had encountered by chance and repaired.

At this moment, it clearly recognized Yang Ye, and so it had taken the initiative to greet him.

The sword cultivator said, “It still recognizes you!”

Yang Ye nodded, and then he gazed at the Unfettered One and waited for him to continue.

The Unfettered One grinned, “All those years ago, I gained comprehension by chance in the Sword Sect, and so I abandoned everything and sought the Dao everywhere. This went on until I found my heart, and then I’ve continued until now.”

He gazed at Yang Ye and continued, “During this process, I’ve met many, many people. But only a few have been able to stay in my memories. One of them is your father. He’s a person I admire. While your father’s strength cannot compare to that man on the chair just now, as far as I’m concerned, your father is a truly strong person. Moreover, if your father was still alive, his future accomplishments would definitely be able to surpass that man from before. Unfortunately, his emotions were too deep.”

Yang Ye looked the Unfettered One in the eyes, and he couldn’t help but clench his fists.

The Unfettered One smiled, “The strong? What is a truly strong person?”

He gazed at Yang Ye, “Do you know in what aspect I’ve lost to you?”

He lost to me? Yang Ye was puzzled.

The Unfettered One smiled, “My sword is willing to be your sword. I’m sure you can sense that it doesn’t reject you. However, your sword of blood will never be my sword.”

The Sword Precursor!

Would the Sword Precursor be willing to become the Unfettered One’s sword?

If she was given a chance to choose between them, it was obvious that she would choose Yang Ye.

They had a relationship!

There were true emotions between them!

Meanwhile, the Unfettered One continued, “My strength is superior to you, but your sword and Sprite Progenitor won’t follow me because of that. One of the reasons I feel you’re worth the wait is how sincere you are toward others.”

He glanced at the little fellow on Yang Ye’s shoulder and smiled, “The world thinks of her as a Sprite Progenitor, but in your heart, she’s just a loved one.”

He suddenly patted Yang Ye on the shoulder, “There is too much karma coiled around you, and you care about too, too much. You wish to protect everything, and that is why you keep strengthening yourself. Your strength and my strength are completely different. You become stronger for the sake of protecting, and I become stronger purely for the sake of becoming stronger.”

Yang Ye laughed bitterly, “But I’m no match for you!”

The Unfettered One grinned, “That’s because I was born countless years before you. Moreover, a path of emotion is much more difficult than a path without emotion. As they say, it takes years to change your ways for the better, but it takes days to become bad. Being emotionless is to abandon everything. It’s not difficult for a ruthless person. However, the path of emotion is different. It is responsibility. Abandoning responsibility is easy, but consciously shouldering it is difficult, very difficult!”

He looked up at the sky, “Among the myriad of Grand Daos, the Dao of emotion is at the top. Because tell me, if this world is without emotion, what kind of world would it be? But now, emotions are gradually being abandoned by everyone because the path of emotions is the most difficult to thread.”

Yang Ye fell silent.

Emotions?

Actually, he hadn’t given it much thought, nor had he thought about eternal life. Since the very beginning, the most important thing to him was that everyone by his side remained by his side. Unfortunately, nothing ever went as planned!

The Unfettered One smiled and said, “There’s nothing interesting to me left in this world. Once we part this time, I don’t know when we’ll meet again. But I hope that we can fight when we meet again, I hope we can really fight. Of course, there’s one more thing. I hope you remember that we’re from Profounder Continent, and it’s our initial world.”

He vanished once he finished speaking.

The Unfettered One’s sword tapped Yang Ye’s hand lightly, and then it vanished into the sky.

Profounder Continent!

Yang Ye fell silent for a long time, and then he shook his head and smiled, “I’ll never forget that!”

He walked off into the distance with Snowy.

…

At the entrance to the Primal Battlefield, around eight Limitbreaker Realm experts were gathered here! Among them was the master of the Longevity Sect, Li Changsheng; the master of the Freedom Sect, Mo Dao’zi; the Creation Sect’s master, Yuwen Qiu; and Han Fei’er, the master of the Immortality Sect were all here!

Waiting!

They were waiting for that sword cultivator.

Besides them, there were some other experts, the first to have rushed back from the Eternal River.

The Primal Battlefield was the greatest resource possessed by those powers, and now that the Unfettered One had destroyed the restrictions on it, it was no different than provocation to them. Thus, they unanimously decided that they should make an example of him!

The leader of the group was the master of the Longevity Sect, Li Changsheng.

Li Changsheng glanced at the door and said, “Everyone, that sword cultivator may be a little strong, and I think he’s probably at the peak of the One World Realm. He may even be at the Two World Realm. So, please do not hold back later. Use your full strength and kill him with a single blow!”
