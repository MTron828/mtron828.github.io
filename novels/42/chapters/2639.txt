Chapter 2640 – Don’t Be Rash!

Blood Maiden’s eyes narrowed slightly, and then she immediately activated the Blood Domain.

However, as soon as it appeared, a wave of powerful and mysterious energy enveloped her Blood Domain.

The Water Domain!

Shui Wubian!

In an instant, boundless water strangely appeared within Blood Maiden’s Blood Domain, and the powerful Boundless Water instantly suppressed her Domain completely! Her Domain was completely and utterly suppressed!

It wasn’t that the Blood Domain was inferior to the Water Domain, it was just the gap in their cultivations!

In an instant, the Blood Domain started to explode apart inch by inch.

“Ugh… R-Run…” Blood Maiden’s shrill voice came from within the Blood Domain.

“Run?” Mr. Jing shook his head and tapped his right hand forward. The space around Nether Maiden and the others instantly warped.

However, the warped space suddenly started to recover slowly.

“Huh?” Mr. Jing gazed at Nether Maiden and sized her up. He spoke softly, “The power to reverse. Interesting. Unfortunately, you’re too weak.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he clenched his right fist and twisted it.

Bang!

The space around Nether Maiden was obliterated. At the same time, a wave of powerful energy slammed against her.

Bam!

Nether Maiden was blasted extremely far away. Moreover, her body exploded apart, and her soul couldn’t even react before a pitch black chain pierced through both her shoulder blades.

The pitch black chain was blazing with flames, and it instantly caused Nether Maiden’s face to warp!

Mr. Jing looked to the side, “Nether Lord, she’s a friend of Yang Ye’s. If you treat her like that, then based on his character, your Nether World will definitely suffer annihilation!”

A middle aged man covered in dense Death Energy walked over from afar.

The middle aged man spoke indifferently, “Yang Ye? Mr. Jing, are you that afraid of him?”

Mr. Jing smiled, “Not really, but he can’t be underestimated.”

Meanwhile, the Nether Lord suddenly spread his arms. In an instant, countless pitch black chains shot toward the others and even the disciples of the Ancient Sword Sect.

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!

The bodies of all who were touched by the chains instantly exploded, and their souls were bound and immobilized!

Absolute suppression!

Meanwhile, the Nether Lord raised his right hand slightly, and the chains on Nether Maiden squeezed down a little. In an instant, Nether Maiden’s soul turned slightly ethereal.

The Nether Lord grinned, “You must be even more ruthless when dealing with the ruthless. Mr. Jing, why don’t we just kill all of them. Alright? Their souls are very pure, and they’ll be extremely useful to my Nether World.”

Mr. Jing shook his head, “We still need him and the Sprite Progenitor. Take them away.”

The Nether Lord shrugged and vanished on the spot.

Nether Maiden and the others vanished with him.

However, Elder Xue wasn’t taken away.

Mr. Jing gazed at Elder Xue and smiled, “I’ve left you behind so that you’ll tell Yang Ye to bring the Sprite Progenitor to the End World. If he doesn’t arrive in three days, I’ll send him the heads of all those disciples and women.”

Mr. Jing turned around and left once he finished speaking.

Suddenly, a voice came from the side, “Aren’t all of you afraid of Qi Bitian and Tian Xiu?”

Mr. Jing shot a glance to the right and grinned, “They… will probably not show themselves again. Haha…”

He turned around and vanished into the distance.

The person there fell silent.

Not long after Mr. Jing vanished, an old man appeared.

It was the Ye Clan’s ancestor, Ye Zhitian.

He glanced at the sect below, shook his head, and sighed, “Notify Yang Ye!”

“Yes!” Someone responded from the shadows and left.Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Ye Zhitian looked into the sky while a trace of worry could be seen in his eyes.

One wave was just over and another had risen!

…

The War Dimension.

The space in front of Yang Ye trembled, and then Yang Ye’s face warped. A wave of terrifying slaughter intent rippled out of him.

A moment later, a ray of blood red light shot up into the air and vanished into the sky.

Cang Mu and Sha Ji exchanged glances, and then they hurried after it.

…

The Ancient Sword Sect.

When Yang Ye returned to the sect, only Elder Xue remained.

She knelt down slowly upon seeing Yang Ye, “We failed you.”

Yang Ye shook his head, “It was my mistake. I knew they would target me, but I didn’t make sufficient preparations.”

He glanced at the surroundings, “Tell me what happened.”

Elder Xue hesitated.

Yang Ye said, “Tell me!”

She sighed and told him everything that occurred.

Yang Ye was exceptionally calm. Even when he heard that their bodies had been destroyed and souls were bound and pierced, he still remained silent.

Elder Xue glanced at Yang Ye once she was done, “Sect Master…”

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings and said, “Elder Xue, look for a place to hide. Don’t show yourself without my orders.”

Elder Xue spoke solemnly, “Let me go with you, Sect Master!”

Yang Ye shook his head, “Let me do it myself. Elder Xue, they are beyond your strength, so just protect yourself well. Because I may not be able to protect you for now.”

She walked over to Yang Ye, “Sect Master, I’m worried about them too, but you must remember to never act rashly. Don’t ever be rash.”

She knew that Yang Ye would go to their rescue, but she didn’t want him to be rash.

Rashness couldn’t save them, and it would cost Yang Ye his life too!

Yang Ye nodded, “I won’t be rash.”

Yang Ye suddenly looked to the right at this point, “Senior, please show yourself!”

As soon as he said that, an old man and woman appeared before him.

It was Ye Zhitian and Ye Zhibei.

Ye Zhitian laughed bitterly, “I’m sorry, I couldn’t do anything!”

Yang Ye nodded, “I understand.”

Ye Zhitian glanced at Elder Xue and said, “She’ll be safe in my Ye Clan.”

Yang Ye cupped his fist, “Thank you.”

Ye Zhitian shook his head, “You rescued Zhibei from the desolate race that day, so we owe you. Moreover, you’re a friend of hers.”

Forming goodwill!

Actually, Ye Zhitian’s thoughts were very simple, and it was to try his best to form goodwill with Yang Ye. Coupled with Yang Ye’s friendship with Ye Zhibei, it wasn’t bad for the Ye Clam to form goodwill with Yang Ye. After all, Yang Ye had never targeted the Ye Clan, and he’d even helped them.

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings and said, “Senior, do you know how to get to the End World?”

Ye Zhitian nodded slightly, “I went there with the Eternal Lord once. The strongest of our universe are gathered there, and now, even the experts and powers that escaped the Origin World may have moved there. They probably want you to bring the Sprite Progenitor there for two reasons. Firstly, to repair that world! Secondly, if you refuse to repair it, they may try to take the Sprite Progenitor and use her to conceal themselves from the heavens so that they can conceal themselves from Destiny!”

He gazed at Yang Ye and continued, “If you go now, the only outcome is being at their mercy. Because you’re not strong enough to fight them.”

Yang Ye nodded, “I know, so I won’t be rash.”

Ye Zhitian glanced at Yang Ye and sighed softly, “Anything is possible while you’re still alive. Take care.”

Ye Zhibei walked over to Yang Ye and said, “No matter what, be careful. Come to the Ye Clan if you’re driven to a corner!”

Ye Zhitian glanced at Ye Zhibei and remained silent.

Yang Ye nodded, “Alright, you take care too.”

Ye Zhibei didn’t say anything. She turned around and vanished with Ye Zhitian and Elder Xue.

Once they left, Sha Ji and Cang Mu appeared behind Yang Ye.

Cang Mu hesitated to speak.

Yang Ye spoke softly, “So…”

Cang Mu shook his head, “Master asked us to follow you. But my personal suggestion is to not be rash. Even if the three of us go there, we won’t be able to do anything there.”

Sha Ji nodded, “We know a little about the End World. It’s where people who have nowhere to go reside. Our strength isn’t enough. Of course, we will go with you if you insist.”

Yang Ye glanced at them and spoke softly, “Thank you.”

They nodded, and then they gazed at Yang Ye and waited for him to make a decision.

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings and spoke softly, “I’ll definitely make them suffer.”

Yang Ye vanished into the distance, and the two old men followed him.

Yang Ye didn’t go to the End World, he went to the Void World instead!

The Void World!

As soon as he arrived there, the Void Lord appeared before him. But once he saw Yang Ye and the two old men behind Yang Ye, the Void Lord fell silent for a moment and said, “Watch what you do!”

He turned around and left.

Yang Ye led the two old men into the Void Space, and he saw a woman in there!

Sky Maiden!

She was seated cross-legged there and was ceaselessly devouring the planets in the surroundings.

At this moment, her aura was deep like outer space!

It was unfathomable!

Cang Mu and Sha Ji exchanged glances, and they both saw solemness in each other’s eyes!

Yang Ye walked over to her and said, “Eldest Sister, I’ve been bullied.”

A moment of silence ensued, and then Sky Maiden opened her eyes.
