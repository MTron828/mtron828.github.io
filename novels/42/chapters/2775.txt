Chapter 2776 – Me, But Not Me!

Yang Ye was quite stunned.

What the heck is she saying?

But she didn’t say anything else and just walked away.

Yang Ye was shocked, “You’re just leaving?”

She stopped, fell silent for a long time, and then said, “What else?”

Yang Ye replied solemnly, “Will you merge with her in the future?”

Merge!

He didn’t want that to happen at all. He had quite the good impression of this woman in black and the woman in white, and he didn’t want to fight them.

She shook her head, “All of that depends on her.”

She gazed at Yang Ye and continued, “Do your best to stop her.”

Yang Ye replied solemnly, “Do you know what she’s up to?”

The woman in black replied indifferently, “Do you really want me to tell you?”

Yang Ye replied, “You can’t?”

She said, “If I do, both of us will die right now!”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

She walked over to Yang Ye, “She’s very conceited. Of course, she has the strength to back it up, and that’s your opportunity.”

The woman in black turned around and walked away.

Suddenly, Great Unknown shot forward and arrived before her.

She spoke softly, “Do you still need it?”

Yang Ye shook his head.

She nodded, “I’m taking it then.”

She sliced open space in front of her with Great Unknown and vanished from Yang Ye’s field of vision.

Yang Ye fell silent on the spot.

Based on what she said, Yang Ye knew that she and the others were already aware of their strongest form’s plans. Moreover, they wanted him to stop her. Because they may merge with her in the future, and at that time, they wouldn’t be themselves anymore.

That was why they’d chosen someone!

A short while later, Yang Ye turned around and left.

He knew that they’d helped as much as they could.

Now, he had to rely on himself!

Yang Ye shot through the boundless reaches of space on his sword.

Meanwhile, the transmission stone in his pocket trembled, and then Ding Shaoyao’s voice came from it, “We’ve found Erya. However, we dare not approach her. She isn’t the same Erya she was.”

Erya!

Yang Ye hurriedly asked, “Where is she?”

Ding Shaoyao replied softly, “She seems to be pursuing someone, and it looks like she’s injured.”

Yang Ye’s face fell, “Tell me where she is.”

A moment later, Yang Ye vanished into the starry sky.

An hour later, Yang Ye arrived at the location Ding Shaoyao had told him about. However, besides cracked open space, there was nothing here!

There had been a battle here, and it hadn’t been long since it ended!

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings, and then his expression changed slightly before he shot swiftly ahead. Around 15 minutes later, he noticed something tearing open space in the distance!

Erya’s aura!

Yang Ye’s face instantly became solemn when he sensed her aura!

Vicious!

The viciousness she emanated right now was much, much stronger than before.

Meanwhile, Erya suddenly stopped and gazed at Yang Ye, and her eyes were dark red!

They were a gorgeous red!

Yang Ye stopped and didn’t dare to get too close to her.

Erya stared at him, and then she suddenly slammed a punch at him from afar.

Bang!

A fist flashed, and a pitch black spatial rift appeared before Yang Ye!

Yang Ye drew his sword and slashed.

Bang!

Yang Ye was pushed back repeatedly until he arrived over 3km away.

Yang Ye gazed at his right hand once he stopped himself, and it was trembling uncontrollably.

Yang Ye was shocked because she was much stronger than she’d been that day!

Suddenly, Erya vanished on the spot, and then Yang Ye sensed a powerful aura sweep toward him. It was so strong it felt like a tsunami that was about to suffocate him!

Yang Ye closed his eyes and sheathed his sword. An instant later, he stomped his right foot down, soared up into the air, and swung his sword.

Bang!

Yang Ye’s sword instantly obliterated Erya’s aura. Meanwhile, a small fist slammed against the Sword Precursor.

Boom!

Yang Ye was instantly blasted far away!

Yang Ye stopped, and a strand of blood seeped out from the corner of his mouth. Erya was about to attack again when Yang Ye suddenly withdrew her horns, and then Erya stopped just 30m away from him.

Her gaze descended on those horns!

Yang Ye wiped off the blood on the corner of his mouth and said, “Erya, do you still remember me?”

Erya stared at those horns. A long time passed before she glanced coldly at Yang Ye and slammed a punch forward.

Boom!

The space before her was instantly blasted into bits.

Yang Ye was blasted backward repeatedly, but Erya didn’t attack again and just left.

Yang Ye roared with fury, “Erya!”

Erya’s figure paused for a moment, but just a moment later, she sped up and vanished into the starry sky.

Yang Ye closed his eyes slowly.

She recognized those horns, but she didn’t seem to recognize him.

Yang Ye stood there silently for a very long time, and then he turned around and left.

…

Somewhere in the clouds, a woman gazed at the Go board before her and seemed like she was in deep thought.

A long time passed before she shook her head slightly, “All of you’ve really disappointed me.”

Meanwhile, a shadow appeared on the chair before her, and it just sat there.

The shadow didn’t speak and just placed a black piece on the board.

The woman grinned, “Interesting. The game is actually getting a little interesting. I underestimated you, just a little!”

The shadow said, “Your other forms are causing trouble for me!”

She smiled, “That’s your problem!”

The shadow said, “I can kill them?”

She chuckled, “So long as you can, feel free to do so.”

The shadow fell silent for a long time and said, “They are you too.”

She replied, “They are me, but not me. Of course, it depends on me.”

The shadow spoke softly, “Since you’ve said that, I’ll kill them then.”

She smiled and remained silent, “Allow me to be frank, you probably can’t kill them without your main body. Actually, you can use your main body. I’ve told you that I won’t kill you. So, what are you afraid of?”

The shadow fell silent, and then it raised a piece and placed it down.

She glanced at the board and smiled, “I see, so you have something up your sleeve.”

The shadow gradually vanished.

She gazed at Justice and smiled, “Don’t worry, your howl will resound through the Three Dimensional Universe and Four Dimensional Universe soon, and you will be the final sword howl.”

As she spoke, she walked over to the nearby tree and looked up in silence. No one knew what she was thinking.Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

…

Meanwhile, at an unknown pitch black hole in space, a dark figure suddenly appeared there. The dark figure just stood there while seeming to be waiting for something.

The mysterious expert!

The dark shadow was the mysterious expert from the End World!

Not long after, a shadow soundlessly condensed into form nearby.

The mysterious expert asked, “What is that woman planning?”

The shadow replied indifferently, “What do you think?”

The mysterious expert replied, “What about you? What does your Four Dimensional Universe want?”

The shadow replied, “The same thing you want.”

The mysterious expert fell silent for a short while and said, “She wants the Good Sprite and Evil Beast. We can’t let her have them.”

The shadow replied, “If she takes action now, no one can stop her!”

The mysterious expert shook his head, “Since she isn’t trying to get them now, it means the time for that hasn’t come. We must get the Good Sprite and Evil Beast before then. Even if we can’t obtain them, we must eliminate them.”

The shadow said, “Those women are quite troublesome!”

The mysterious expert replied, “I’ll keep them busy. I’ll leave Yang Ye to you, alright?”

The shadow fell silent for a short while and said, “Alright.”

The mysterious expert turned around and left.

A short while later, the shadow vanished as well.

After the mysterious expert left the black hole, he waved his right hand, and the space before him cracked open. A moment later, he entered the crack, and then he appeared in another part of the starry sky. Zuo Mu and the others were here.

Something worth mentioning was that Shu Wubian was here too!

The mysterious expert pulled his hands in opposite directions, and then a huge teleportation formation appeared beneath them. A moment later, he activated it, and then they vanished on the spot.

At another part of the starry sky, Qi Bitian and Tian Xiu stopped abruptly. The space before them had started to tremble violently.

A moment later, a group appeared before them.

It was the mysterious expert’s group.

Qi Bitian glanced at them, “They aren’t from the Four Dimensional Universe!”

The mysterious expert didn’t say anything, and he just tossed something forward. A moment later, it shook violently, and then exploded.

In an instant, a barrier of light appeared in the surroundings!

It was fully made of pitch black threads!

The barrier of light had locked off this part of space.

Qi Bitian’s eyes narrowed slightly, “They’re trying to trap us… We aren’t their target, and it’s probably someone else who’s gone to deal with that kid.”

Tian Xiu nodded slightly, “Which one of us is staying behind?”

Qi Bitian glanced at the mysterious expert’s group, “I’m afraid none of us will be leaving. However, I still plan to try! You go!”

Tian Xiu didn’t waste her breath and just shot off into the distance.

Bang!

A flame suddenly appeared before her, and then jets of flames shot at Tian Xiu. Tian Xiu’s eyes narrowed slightly as she raised both her palms, “Omni Ruin!”

In an instant, the flames before her started to disperse!

Tian Xiu didn’t attack again and continued forward. However, an afterimage suddenly flashed.

Bang!

An explosion resounded, and then Tian Xiu returned to where she’d been a while ago.

The mysterious expert was in front of her.

The mysterious expert crossed his arms before his chest, “No one can save him now!”
