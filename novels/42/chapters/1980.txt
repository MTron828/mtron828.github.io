Chapter 1981 – 11 Swords!

My Lord? Yang Ye glanced at the Weapon Seal with quite a strange expression on his face. He’d merely intended to give it a try, and he hadn’t expected it to work.

Of course, this was a good thing!

Yang Ye took a step forward and sized up the middle aged man. He noticed that the middle aged man really was just a puppet.

A puppet without a consciousness of his own!

A See Dao Realm puppet!

Yang Ye fell silent for a moment, and then he waved his right hand and transported the middle aged man into the Primordial Pagoda.

Yang Ye walked into the city.

The city was a scene of desolation. Countless buildings had crumbled, and they were pitch black as if they’d been burned.

A battle had happened here in the past!

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings. The city was deathly silent, and the surroundings were filled with a gloomy aura that made him feel extremely uncomfortable!

The 12 swords of slaughter!

Yang Ye didn’t stay and continued further into the city. It didn’t take long for him to stop. A tall tower stood not too far away from him. Its top had been sliced off, and only half of it remained.

There were two striking words at the center of the tower—Weapon Cemetery!

Weapon Cemetery!I’m finally here!

Yang Ye seemed visibly relieved. He didn’t hesitate to enter the tower, and then he was stunned.

At this moment, he was in a hall, and there were 12 people seated cross-legged there. There were men and women amongst them, but there were no signs of life coming from them.

In front of them was the statue of an old man who held a sword in hand.

Yang Ye glanced at them, and then started walking forward. Suddenly, a voice resounded, “You’re the person my Martial Uncle chose?”

Yang Ye stopped and turned around. He saw an ethereal figure above the man who was seated cross-legged before him. The ethereal figure had been formed by the man.

Yang Ye glanced at him and said, “Your martial uncle?”

The man replied, “The one who gave you the Weapon Seal!”

Yang Ye nodded slightly, “Yes!”

The man fell silent for a few breaths of time and replied, “What ability do you possibly have for him to do that?”

Ability? Yang Ye chuckled, “I don’t know either. Anyway, he gave it to me. Of course, I can return it to you if you want.”

The man gazed at Yang Ye for a long time and said, “The 12 swords of slaughter should be called the 12 vicious swords. Every single one of them is absolutely vicious. Only the Seal Master of my Slaughter Line was able to suppress them all those years ago.”

12 vicious swords!

Yang Ye asked, “What are you trying to say?”

The man answered, “You’re too weak. You can’t suppress them, so you’ll only suffer from backlash if you try to do it by force!”

Yang Ye asked, “There’s something I don’t really understand. Why didn’t they take these swords when the Slaughter Line was annihilated?”

“Because the last Seal Master hid them before he died.” The man continued, “Unless the Weapon Progenitor comes himself, no one else can locate them without the Weapon Seal!”

The Weapon Seal! Yang Ye glanced at the seal in his grasp, and then he gazed at the man, “I want to take them now!”

The man spoke bluntly, “You’re too weak!”

Yang Ye replied, “It’s fine. I know what I’m doing!”

The man fell silent for a long time, and then he slowly floated towards Yang Ye, “Those 12 swords are…”

Suddenly, something unexpected occurred.

A ferocious expression appeared on the man’s face, and then he vanished on the spot. At the same time, a sword appeared before Yang Ye’s forehead.

The surroundings fell silent.

The sword before Yang Ye’s forehead was dark red, and less than a finger wide. However, it was extremely long, and it was at least 70% longer than an ordinary sword!

The sword stopped before Yang Ye’s forehead yet didn’t stab in because of Yang Ye’s Sword Domain.

The Sword Domain had caused the sword to slow down, and it had suppressed the sword!

Yang Ye flashed over 30m back, and then he deactivated the Sword Domain.

There was a solemn expression in his eyes.

He didn’t dare to suppress it longer because the energy contained within the sword was too powerful, and it was very likely that he would suffer from backlash if he did!

Yang Ye looked up. The man was gone, and he was replaced by a sword!

Yang Ye spoke indifferently, “You’re one of the 12 swords, right?”

The sword didn’t say anything. It just suddenly appeared in front of Yang Ye and stabbed at his face.

A sword technique!

The sword was actually using a sword technique!

However, Yang Ye who was familiar with all sorts of extraordinary sword techniques didn’t fear such techniques at all. He flicked his wrist slightly and stabbed forward.

Clang!

The sword was blasted away!

It didn’t take long for the sword to stop. Suddenly, it started trembling. In an instant, around 100 rays of sword energy appeared around it, and then they instantly arrived before Yang Ye.

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly. He took a step forward, and 100 rays of sword energy appeared around him as well. After that, they shot forward like arcs of lightning.

Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!

Sword energy filled the hall. They slammed against the walls, causing deep marks to be left behind in their wake. However, it didn’t take long for those marks to vanish.

Three breaths of time later, the sword energy vanished.

One man and one sword stood in confrontation!

Yang Ye twisted his neck, “Come! Let’s continue!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he vanished on the spot, and the sword trembled violently before shooting forward as well.

A dark red sword flashed around Yang Ye. Everywhere it passed, it left a dark red mark in space.

A short while later, Yang Ye noticed that the Spiritbreaker sword in his hand was actually gradually losing its ability!

Corrosion!

This sword before him was actually able to corrode Spiritbreaker!

Yang Ye quickly put the sword away and took out the holy sword. Yang Ye didn’t hesitate to use Shadow Sword immediately!

Swish! Swish! Swish!

Afterimages covered the surroundings.

Yang Ye held his sword with both hands and swung his sword incessantly at the dark red sword, causing it to be pushed back repeatedly.

Around 15 minutes later, Yang Ye stopped.

The sword floated silently before him.

Yang Ye was about to grab it when the sword suddenly trembled, and then another sword appeared by its side. This sword was magenta, two fingers wide, and had rays of light flowing all around it.

But that wasn’t the end of it. Another sword appeared beside it…

Just like that, in just a short while, 11 swords had appeared before Yang Ye!

The dark red sword was the leader!

Yang Ye noticed that every single one of them emanated an extremely vicious aura.

There were supposed to be 12 swords, but there were only 11 in front of him.

Yang Ye tightened his grip on his sword, “What?”

“Hand over the Weapon Seal!” A voice resounded.

Yang Ye looked at the dark red sword and said, “Hand it over? Are all of you planning on rebelling?”

“Rebelling?” A fierce voice resounded from the sword, “We were free, but that old bastard forcefully gathered us and trapped us here. Damnable human! Hand over the Weapon Seal or we’ll feast on your blood today!”

“As expected of vicious swords!” Yang Ye chuckled, “I’m a little curious about something. Why do you want the seal?”

“That’s our business!” The sword spoke ferociously, “Will you hand it over or not?”

“Fuck you!” Yang Ye howled with fury, “You’re just a bunch of swords! How dare you act so arrogantly? Come on! Let’s fight!”

Yang Ye waved his right hand, and the holy sword shot forward.

The dark red sword suddenly shook, “Kill him!”

In an instant, the 11 swords shot forward like bolts of lightning.

Yang Ye was quite regretful at this point. He regretted being so rash. Violence couldn’t solve anything, and he should have tried to win them over with kindness!

The reason he felt regretful was that he’d far underestimated the might of these swords. They’d instantly suppressed him upon attacking.

He was in a very passive position, and he could only suffer a beating!

He was utterly suppressed and didn’t have the strength to fight back at all!

Bang!

Suddenly, a ray of golden light swept out from within him, and then his entire body was covered in a thin layer of golden light!

The Gold Form!

At this moment, Yang Ye had been forced to use the Gold Form!

However, he noticed that even that didn’t make a difference. Every single one of those swords tore through his God Form with ease, and it didn’t take long for him to fall into a miserable state.

The Sword Domain!

Yang Ye didn’t dare to hold back at all and immediately utilized it.

Once the Sword Domain appeared, the swords were suppressed, but it didn’t take long for them to start trembling!

They were fighting back!

Yang Ye’s eyelids twitched at the sight of this, and he hurriedly deactivated the Sword Domain and said, “I think that violence can’t solve anything, and discussion is the only way to solve problems. What do you think?”

“Hand over the weapon seal!” The sword roared with fury.

The weapon seal! Yang Ye withdrew the weapon seal, glanced at it, and then glanced at the sword. He noticed that all 11 swords had moved backwards.

Fear!

Yang Ye could sense that they feared the seal!

Yang Ye thought for a moment and said, “Why do you want this weapon seal?”

“Give it to us!” The sword spoke fiercely, “Otherwise, we’ll bathe in your blood!”

Yang Ye fell silent for a moment and replied, “I think that discussion won’t change anything, so we should just use violence to resolve this!”

Yang Ye slowly placed the weapon seal against his chest while the swords watched, and then a ray of golden light surged out and instantly sucked away the weapon seal.

Yang Ye stared at the swords, “It’s within a treasure of mine. Do you dare to go in and get it?”

“Why not?!” As soon as it finished speaking, it led all the other swords into Yang Ye’s chest.
