Chapter 2478 – Snowy’s the Best!

The Limitbreaker Realm in the body!

Yang Ye laid there gasping in space while arcs of electricity covered his body.

A long time passed before the electricity gradually faded.

Yang Ye returned to the Primordial Pagoda.

In the cultivation room, Yang Ye sat down cross-legged while strands of powerful aura rippled out from him.

The aura was growing stronger and stronger.

Suddenly…

Boom!

The space in the room shook!

The True Void Realm!

Yang Ye had instantly attained the True Void Realm, but that wasn’t the end of it. Around an hour later, he attained the True World Realm, and then two hours later, he was at the World Lord Realm!

In just this short while, Yang Ye had attained the World Lord Realm from the True Dao Realm!

but that wasn’t the end of it, his aura was still growing.

Around two hours later!

Boom!

A powerful aura swept out from within him, causing the entire cultivation room to tremble!

The Limitbreaker Realm!

Yang Ye stood up, glanced at his hands, and clenched them slowly. In an instant, a powerful force seeped out from within his fists.

Meanwhile, Sword Scroll appeared before him and asked, “How do you feel?”

How do I feel?

Yang Ye took a deep breath and grinned, “I feel so full of energy. I should be able to swing my sword seven times with the Sword Domain now, and even eight times may be possible! As for my flying swords, they will be faster and more powerful.”

Yang Ye issued a command in his heart.

Swoosh!

Two rays of sword energy were thousands of kilometers away!

Flying swords!

The speed and might of them were more than five times greater than before!

His strength had increased tremendously!

Sword Scroll asked, “Can you still increase your cultivation?”

Yang Ye nodded. Actually, his cultivation could rise further, but he stopped. It was best for his cultivation to stay on par with his body, and it wasn’t advisable to instantly increase his cultivation by so many levels. Doing it slowly ensured a better foundation!”

Sword Scroll asked, “Can we go to Eternal Kingdom now?”

Yang Ye gazed at her, “You really want to go there?”

She fell silent for a moment and said, “You should know about my main body now. My main body is divided into three parts, the sword hall, sword scroll, and sword book. All those years ago, the sword hall and sword book were blasted into bits, but their fragments are still in that sect of mine. I need to retrieve those fragments, then get Snowy to help me recover, condense my spirit, and restore my main body.”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and nodded, “Alright, we’ll go once I’ve wrapped up my business in Eternal Border!”

She glanced at him and said, “Thank you!”

Yang Ye shook his head, “I should be thanking you. You’ve helped me more than I have helped you.”

Sword Scroll spoke softly, “Then let’s help each other!”

Yang Ye smiled, “That’s great!”

“Big Brother Yang…” Suddenly, Erya’s voice came from the outside.

Yang Ye and Sword Scroll left the cultivation room and went to Erya, and they were stunned upon seeing her.

Erya was still the same, but there were two fangs in her mouth.

She looked like a little zombie!

Yang Ye asked, “What are those?”

Erya touched the fangs and shook her head, “I don’t know. They just sprouted earlier. Right, they’re a little itchy. I want to bite something!”

Yang Ye was stunned speechless.

Sword Scroll walked over to Erya and touched her fangs gently. However, as soon as she touched them, her finger was immediately cut open!

Sword Scroll hurriedly pulled her hand back while shock filled her eyes, “They are so sharp!”

Sharp!

Yang Ye was quite shocked too. He walked over to Erya and glanced at the fangs. They weren’t very long, and they were just slightly longer than ordinary teeth. Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and summoned the Sword Supreme, “Erya, bite this!”

Erya blinked and said, “Big Brother Yang, I think I can bite it into pieces!”

Yang Ye glanced at her. He didn’t think she was lying. So, he switched it to Executor, “What about this?”

Erya thought for a moment, took Executor, and bit it.

Clang!

A clear and resounding clang arose, and then Executor struggled free of her grasp and flew over to Yang Ye.

Yang Ye and Sword Scroll noticed two small teeth marks on it!

They exchanged glances and saw shock in each other’s eyes. Executor was the number one sword in Eternal Kingdom! However, she’d still left marks on it with her fangs!

What kind of crazy biting force was that?

Yang Ye gazed at Erya, “Erya, how do you feel now that you have these fangs?”

“How do I feel?” She blinked, “They are slightly itchy. I feel like biting something.”

Yang Ye hurriedly said, “D-Don’t just bite anything. Endure it. After all, this is our home. So, don’t destroy it, alright?”

If she was allowed to bite anything she wanted, she could even bite this world into bits!

She felt quite helpless, “But they are really quite itchy!”

Yang Ye smiled, “Eat! Don’t you have lots of dragon meat? You can eat it…”

That dragon was enough for them to eat for at least a week or two!

Erya still felt quite helpless.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye asked, “Erya, how’s your body right now?”

Her body!

Erya glanced at it and replied, “It feels stronger than before. Big Brother Yang, I think that sword of yours can’t hurt me at all now. Wanna try?”

Yang Ye felt speechless.

The facts proved that she wasn’t lying. Her body really was capable of withstanding Executor. Of course, there was something that couldn’t be overlooked. Executor was only at 50% strength right now. Even then, Erya’s physical defenses were extremely terrifying!

It could be said that her body was at the Five World Realm! Even if it wasn’t, it was absolutely not far off!

Now, she could use just her body to go head-on against a Five World Realm expert!

As for her fangs, horns, claws, and tail, every one of them was more terrifying than a Divine Treasure! Not to mention that she had a pair of wings that was a Super Divine Treasure!

She was the one who had a whole set of divine treasures!

The only flaw she had was that she had such a huge appetite, and she wanted to eat everything.

Snowy, on the other hand, wanted every treasure she saw.

The two little fellows were the perfect combination!

Yang Ye left the Primordial Pagoda, and he saw the Desolate Emperor.

The Desolate Emperor glanced at Yang Ye, “The Limitbreaker Realm!”

Yang Ye nodded.

The Desolate Emperor nodded slightly, “Are you planning on going to Eternal Kingdom?”

Yang Ye nodded, “Do you have any suggestions?”

The Desolate Emperor spoke indifferently, “Keep a low profile!”

He turned around and vanished once he finished speaking.

Yang Ye was left stunned speechless on the spot.

Yang Ye shook his head and smiled. He was about to leave when Snowy suddenly appeared on his shoulder, and he gazed at her, “Are you alright?”

Snowy shook her little head. She had been too tired earlier, and she was better after sleeping for some time.

Meanwhile, Snowy suddenly pointed at the lightning.Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Yang Ye was stunned and asked, “You’ve taken a liking to it?”

Snowy nodded.

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and asked, “Can you take it with us?”

Snowy blinked and waved her paws while confidence filled her eyes!

Yang Ye smiled, “Give it a try!”

Snowy nodded and floated into the air. Yang Ye was naturally worried about her and went with Snowy.

Erya appeared beside Yang Ye.

She licked her tanghulu and glanced at the mass of lightning, “Big Brother Yang, is Snowy a bandit?”

Yang Ye’s face darkened, “Do you think Snowy’s like a bandit?”

Erya thought for a moment and replied, “A little.”

Yang Ye replied indifferently, “She’s a bandit, and you’re a glutton. You make the perfect combination!”

Erya glanced at him with displeasure before looking up at Snowy, “Big Brother Yang, will those fellows who want Snowy ever give up?”

Yang Ye shook his head.

Erya grunted coldly, “Those bastards! I’ll eat all of them, sooner or later.”

Yang Ye smiled and didn’t say anything.

Meanwhile, Snowy had arrived before the lightning. Both Yang Ye and Erya became vigilant from the sight of this.

Snowy’s tiny figure couldn’t endure a strike from the lightning there!

Snowy gazed at the lightning and waved her little paw. The lightning there immediately started to surge.

Snowy blinked, and then she waved her little paw again. In an instant, countless strands of spirit energy surged up there.

A short while later, the entire mass of lightning was enveloped in spirit energy.

Crackle! Crackle!

In an instant, countless bolts of lightning surged throughout the area.

Crackling resounded incessantly!

Sprite Ascension!

Snowy was using Sprite Ascension on the lightning there!

The lightning was quite stunned by Snowy’s actions, but it didn’t take long for happiness to replace its bewilderment!

However, its happiness didn’t last for long. Snowy suddenly pulled back her paw, and then she blinked at the lightning and walked away.

But she walked very slowly as if she was waiting for something.

Once the spirit energy vanished, the lightning were stunned. Why has it stopped?

It didn’t take long for the lightning to chase after Snowy, but they didn’t strike her. They just followed close behind her and seemed to be conveying something.

Snowy just continued forward slowly, and they just followed her.

Just like that, Yang Ye and Erya watched with astonishment as Snowy smoothly led the lightning into the Primordial Pagoda.

Thus, a mass of lightning appeared in the sky within the Primordial Pagoda. At least more than a hundred bolts of Darkvoid Divine Lightning were in the mass!

Snowy was extremely pleased as she gazed at the lightning.

But the dragon and the others only felt pain. Because it represented that they would have to be struck by lightning for a long time into the future.

Painful days were upon them!

Outside the Primordial Pagoda.

Yang Ye and Erya were still stunned.

They went with Snowy just like that?

Were they so lacking in backbone? They should have resisted a little!

However, they hadn’t resisted at all!

Erya licked her tanghulu, “Snowy is the best! Snowy is amazing!”
