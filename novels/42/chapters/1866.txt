Chapter 1867 – Do You Dare To Take It?

I want to see the Asura Exalt!

As soon as his voice resounded, a shadow shot up into the sky, and then an expanse of black mist swept down towards Yang Ye like a raging dragon.

Yang Ye didn’t hesitate to raise his sword and swing it.

A ray of light flashed.

Hiss!

The black mist was instantly sliced into two. Meanwhile, a middle aged man in a gray robe appeared not too far away from Yang Ye.

Yang Ye glanced at the man and asked, “Asura Exalt?”

The middle aged man replied, “That’s my master. I’m the Governor of Asura City, Mo Jing!”

Yang Ye closed his eyes slowly, “I want to see the Asura Exalt!”

Mo Jing glanced at Yang Ye and said, “Yang Ye, did killing the Night Emperor make you think that you’re invincible?”

Yang Ye replied, “I merely want to see the Asura Exalt. Tell him to come see me or let me go to him!”

Mo Jing looked Yang Ye in the eyes, “He won’t come out here to see you, and I won’t take you to see him.”

Suddenly, Yang Ye opened his eyes, and then he stomped his right foot down and relied on the counterforce to charge up into the sky. Yang Ye grabbed the golden sword with both hands and swung it down at Asura City.

The stars trembled as endless stellar energy surged into Yang Ye’s sword from far away in the distant reaches of space. At the same time, energy surged out like a torrent from beneath the ground and converged into Yang Ye’s sword.

This attack carried the might of the heavens and the earth!

“How dare you!” Mo Jing howled with fury as he transformed into a dense expanse of mist that swept towards Yang Ye. However, the mist hadn’t even been able to come into contact with Yang Ye’s sword energy before it was sliced open.

Boom!

An instant later, Mo Jing was blasted away, and the sword energy entered the city and chopped it into two.

Mo Jing’s pupils constricted at the sight of this. He hadn’t expected Yang Ye’s strength to be this terrifying. Sure enough, the rumors weren’t lies, and Yang Ye was really invincible below Heavenly Exalts while he held that divine sword!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye withdrew a violet crystal and consumed it, and then he started walking slowly towards the city. At the same time, his voice resounded, “Asura Exalt, please come here and meet with me!”

No reply came from the city.

Suddenly, a ray of golden light flashed, and it shot through the city, causing dust and dirt to surge up into the air. At the same time, Yang Ye’s voice resounded again, “Asura Exalt, please come here and meet with me!”

He still received no reply.

Yang Ye stopped and closed his eyes slowly, and the sword in his hand was trembling violently/

A sword howl resounded. Yang Ye’s sword left its sheath, and he was about to attack. However, a voice suddenly resounded, “The way you say please and invite someone is quite unique!”

As soon as the voice finished resounding, a man appeared around 300m away from Yang Ye.

The man seemed to be around the age of 30. He was handsome, but his hair was dark red, causing him to look quite evil. A blood red spike floated by his right hand. The spike was large at the end, and then it slowly became smaller until the tip was sharp as a needle.

The Asura Spike!

It was the Asura Spike which once instilled terror in the hearts of countless experts!

As for the man, he was naturally one of the four Heavenly Exalts, the Asura Exalt!

Yang Ye glanced at the Asura Exalt and said, “According to my knowledge, the Night Emperor used a Quintessence Blood Pearl to make an exchange with you.”

The Asura Exalt nodded, “That did happen.”

Yang Ye slowly clenched his left fist, “That Quintessence Blood Pearl is extremely important to me. Can you part with it?”

The Asura Exalt chuckled, “What if I refuse?”

Yang Ye looked the Asura Exalt in the eyes, “Then I’ll take it.”

“Haha!” The Asura Exalt suddenly started laughing, and he laughed for a while before he gazed at Yang Ye, “Take it? You really are arrogant!” He sized up Yang Ye and continued, “Yang Ye, I actually admire you quite a bit. Regardless of whether it’s your character, or the way you do things, I admire them both. However, do you really think you can take it from me?”

Yang Ye replied, “Do you have enemies?”

The Asura Exalt nodded, “Everyone gets a few lives on their hands while living in this world. So, I naturally have enemies!”

Yang Ye replied, “Even if I can’t kill you, I think that if I risk my life, it shouldn’t be a problem for me to make you suffer heavy injuries as well!”

The Asura Exalt’s eyes narrowed slightly, “Are you threatening me?”

Yang Ye looked the Asura Exalt in the eyes, “That Quintessence Blood Pearl is more important to me than my life.”

“More important than your life?” The Asura Exalt chuckled, “Yang Ye, you can have it. Just give me that sword of yours in exchange!”

Yang Ye tossed the sword over to the Asura Exalt and said, “Do you dare to take it?”

Do you dare?

The Asura Exalt gazed at the golden sword in silence.

He was very well aware of the consequences of taking the sword. Everyone had overlooked it, but the sword had a consciousness of its own, so not just anyone could use it. If it refused to cooperate, then not to mention using it, one might even suffer backlash!

He fell silent for a short while and looked up at Yang Ye, “I can give it to you, but I have a condition. Help me do something. Don’t worry, it doesn’t exceed the scope of your ability, and it won’t put you in a difficult position!”

Yang Ye nodded, “Alright!”

The Asura Exalt flicked a pearl of blood over to Yang Ye.

Yang Ye’s hands started to tremble when he saw it.

Meanwhile, the Asura Exalt said, “There is a strand of soul in it, but at this moment, it’s in deep sleep. Moreover, it’s absolutely weak. So, it’s difficult, very difficult for you to revive her with just that strand of the soul!”

Yang Ye held it carefully and placed it within the Primordial Pagoda. After that, he gazed at the Asura Exalt, “Thank you.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he shot up into the sky.

The Asura Exalt’s voice came from afar, “Come here in three days!”

Yang Ye’s voice resounded, “Alright!”

The Asura Exalt placed his hands behind his back, and he looked up into the distant sky. No one knew what he was thinking.

Meanwhile, Mo Jing suddenly said, “Master, why did you make a compromise?”

The Asura Exalt glanced at Mo Jing, “Don’t compromise and go head-on against him?”

Mo Jing replied, “Your strength is sufficient to kill him!”

“What good would that do?” The Asura Exalt asked, “What’s the point of killing him?”

Mo Jing was at a loss for words.

The Asura Exalt continued, “It’s pointless to kill him. Moreover, I’ll have to pay a price to kill him. So, that makes it worse. As for that pearl of blood, as far as I’m concerned, it’s far inferior when compared to a favor from him.”

He gazed at Mo Jing and continued, “If there’s a chance to be friends, then why become enemies? In this place, having one more friend is a good thing. As for reputation, that’s worthless.”

He vanished on the spot once he finished speaking.

“One more friend….” Mo Jing spoke softly, and then he stood there in silence for a short while before vanishing on the spot.

…

Once he left Asura City, Yang Ye immediately raised his speed to its limits. It didn’t take long for him to arrive in the boundless starry sky. He only stopped once he confirmed that there was no one following him.

After that, he immediately entered the Primordial Pagoda.

Yang Ye brought the pearl of blood to Hou Qing and asked, “Senior, how do I revive her?”

Hou Qing possessed vast knowledge and experience, so Yang Ye knew that Hou Qing would definitely know how to save Blood Maiden.

Hou Qing gazed at the pearl of blood for a long time and said, “It’s difficult!”

Yang Ye said, “Then there’s a way, right?”

Hou Qing nodded, “But it’s clearly impossible to accomplish in this lower universe. You can only accomplish it in the large universe.”

Yang Ye frowned, “Why?”

Hou Qing explained, “There’s a treasure there called the Soul Constructing Mirror. It can construct souls, or I should say, repair souls. If you have that treasure, she’ll have a chance at gaining new life. However, it’s very difficult for you to get it!”

Yang Ye asked, “Why?”

Hou Qing replied, “Remember that bald man who was pursuing the monkey? That treasure is with his ancestor, and his ancestor… In any case, those fellows are difficult to deal with.” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Yang Ye took a deep breath, “I’ll do it no matter how difficult it is!”

To the large universe!

At this moment, Yang Ye had made up his mind.

Suddenly, Hou Qing added, “Kid, you must realize that you’re in a very terrible situation right now. Because I sense that too many want to kill you. Especially the Sovereign of Man. While he won’t come down here personally, he won’t let the matter rest.”

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly, “Senior, I have no way out now.”

Hou Qing replied, “That’s true!”

Yang Ye looked down at the sword in his grasp and said, “Since I was given life, how can I live an ordinary one? If the world refuses to accept me, then I’ll slaughter the world with my sword.”
