Chapter 2578

How strong was Qi Bitian?

Yang Ye didn’t know. In any case, she rarely fought. Of course, there was one thing Yang Ye was certain of, and it was that she was really strong!

However, he didn’t know exactly how strong she was!

But he knew how strong the old woman was.

The old woman was definitely above the Lord Realm. She felt slightly weaker than an expert like the Soul Sect’s Master, but she was stronger than any Lord Realm expert he’d ever met!

Yang Ye hurriedly off to the side when he heard her.

It was a battle between two powerful experts!

The old woman’s gaze was locked on Qi Bitian once she arrived here, and Qi Bitian’s gaze was on her ball.

A trace of vigilance appeared in the old woman’s eyes, and it gradually grew stronger. In the end, her face was extremely solemn!

Unfathomable!

Even with her ability, she was actually unable to see through the young girl before her!

That wasn’t even the main point. The main point was that while she could see the young girl, she couldn’t sense the young girl at all. When her divine sense swept over the area, it was empty there!

Strange!

Meanwhile, Qi Bitian gazed at the old woman, “Are you still not going to make your move?”

The old woman stared at Qi Bitian, “Who are you?”

Qi Bitian shook her head, “You have no right to know that, and if you don’t make a move, I will. Allow me to give you a piece of friendly advice, if I attack, you won’t have a chance to do anything!”

The old woman started laughing from extreme rage, “Such high sounding sentiments! Stop exaggerating!”

As soon as she said that, she raised her right hand slightly and pressed it down.

Bang!

The world throughout the Primordial Pagoda instantly cracked open!

Yang Ye’s eyelids twitched at the sight of this because the old woman was planning to destroy this mid-level world! He hurriedly gazed at Qi Bitian, but the spot he gazed at was empty!

Yang Ye turned to look, and he was stunned.

Qi Bitian was in front of the old woman, and she had her hand around the old woman’s throat!

The old woman’s powerful aura couldn’t be released at all, and she was just being held by the throat like that!

Her eyes were filled with terror!

One move!

She was filled with disbelief because this young girl had restrained her in just a single move!

Qi Bitian gazed at the old woman and shook her head, “I feel guilty to kill you. Because I’m really bullying you when I fight you.”

She released her grasp on the old woman’s throat and patted the latter on the shoulder.

Bam!

A wave of powerful energy shackled the old woman. It was like she was frozen on the spot and couldn’t move at all!

Qi Bitian gazed at Yang Ye, “You kill her!” F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

She continued playing with her ball.

“Kill her?” Yang Ye was stunned and shook his head.

Why kill?

Yang Ye walked over to the old woman, scanned her, and said, “Want to live?”

The old woman just stared at him.

Yang Ye said, “I’ll just be frank. I’m the sect master of the Ancient Sword Sect, and I need experts in my sect. I’d like you to come help me. So, what do you think?”

She revealed a ridiculing smile, “An ant like you is actually trying to enslave me? How laughable!”

Yang Ye wanted to say more, but Qi Bitian suddenly said, “Little Yang, don’t waste your breath. While people like her are weak, no ordinary person can reach such heights. So, don’t waste your energy.”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and nodded, and then Executor appeared in his grasp.

Suddenly, the old woman said, “We can work together!”

“Work together?” Yang Ye gazed at her, “How?”

She spoke solemnly, “I can go to your sect, but there must be a time limit!”

A time limit!

Yang Ye thought for a moment and nodded, “Alright, how long do you think is suitable?”

She glanced at Qi Bitian and replied, “10 years?”

10 years?

Yang Ye blinked and remained silent.

The old woman spoke in a low voice, “20 years, that’s the longest I’m willing to accept!”

Yang Ye replied, “Deal!”

She hesitated for a moment and asked, “Can I leave now?”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and asked, “Can you set out for the Ancient Sword Sect in Eternal Kingdom right now?”

The old woman glanced at him, “You trust me?”

Yang Ye gazed at Qi Bitian, and the latter puckered her mouth and flicked a thread of green light into the old woman’s forehead.

Qi Bitian said, “It will vanish by itself in 20 years. During this time, a single thought of mine can kill you, wherever you are!”

Yang Ye looked back at the old woman, “Of course I trust you. An expert like you would never be shameless, right? I’m absolutely confident in you!”

She glanced at Yang Ye, “It’s the first time I’ve met someone with such thick skin!”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

When she left the Primordial Pagoda, the old woman shot a final glance at Qi Bitian. Yang Ye could discern that she wanted to ask about Qi Bitian’s identity, but the latter refused to pay any attention to her.

The old woman didn’t want to embarrass herself, so she just left without asking.

Once she left, Yang Ye fell silent.

Qi Bitian suddenly asked, “What is it?”

Yang Ye laughed with self-ridicule, “I realized that I’m so absolutely weak.”

“Indeed!” Qi Bitian didn’t hold back at all.

Yang Ye sat on the ground and gazed at his sword. At this moment, he thought of his agreement with the Unfettered One.

Could he really fight the Unfettered One when the time came?

Could he?

Confidence wasn’t something one could just possess, it had to be fostered!

Up until this point in time, he was only at the Five World Realm, and he was absolutely weak in every aspect! So, how would he fight the Unfettered One?

Qi Bitian walked over to Yang Ye and kicked him on the knee. Yang Ye looked up at her, and she smiled, “I have a secret technique that will make you instantly attain the Lord Realm or even above. Want it?”

Yang Ye immediately shook his head. Not to mention that such a secret technique didn’t exist, even if it did, it would be like pulling up a plant just to make it grow!

Qi Bitian said, “See? Do you know what’s the most important when cultivating? The foundation! If the foundation isn’t stable and strong, it grows dangerous as you go higher! Your goal right now should be to fortify your foundation to its limits.”

She gazed at her hand and asked, “Do you know what that move of mine was?”

Yang Ye shook his head.

She smiled, “It’s called Sky Claw. It’s a very, very ordinary move, and it doesn’t even have a rank. However, do you know how long I spent training it? 10,000 times a day for 10 years. At that time, it was all I knew. Even now, after living for so many years, I only know three moves.”

Yang Ye gazed at her, “10 years? 10,000 times per day?”

She nodded slightly, “I encountered a sword cultivator in the abyss, a sword cultivator who shouldn’t exist in this era. His Sword Dao is a little different from yours. His sword is very pure, just like that move of mine. It’s extremely pure, so pure that it is without any impurities. But your sword is very complicated. Being complicated isn’t a bad thing. Because that is your belief in the Sword Dao.”

Yang Ye shook his head, “I don’t really understand!”

Qi Bitian smiled, “If I’m not wrong, you know that drawing technique and flying swords, right?”

Yang Ye nodded.

Qi Bitian said, “I took a look earlier, and the black water out there should be the legendary Boundless Water. It’s a type of water that was born along with the universe. After countless years of transformation, it has transformed into its current state. It is extremely corrosive to the point that even Super Divine Treasures will be corroded over time within it. As for Divine Treasures, they’ll vanish upon falling into it.”

Yang Ye asked, “And?”

Qi Bitian continued, “Besides being extremely corrosive, this kind of water has one more ability, weight. It’s extremely heavy, boundlessly heavy. What I’m trying to say if that if you can practice with your sword in there, especially that drawing technique and your flying swords, then they will definitely undergo a qualitative transformation!”

Yang Ye jumped to his feet, “Y-You said all of that just to make me jump down there?”

In the beginning, he thought she had finally found the kindness in herself to help him, yet all her words of comfort were actually just to make him jump off the bridge!

The Boundless Water!

Even Super Divine Treasures would be corroded by it, and was his body stronger than one? So, wouldn’t he be corroded into a pool of blood?

Qi Bitian flicked her finger, and specks of green light appeared around him.

Yang Ye asked, “What’s this?”

She replied, “A protection barrier. It can temporarily protect you from the Boundless Water.”

As she spoke, she sat down at the side, “You decide if you’re going to go down there.”

Yang Ye walked over to her and asked seriously, “Little Qi, tell me, why do you want me to go down there so badly?”

She blinked, “It’s for your own good! It’ll do wonders for your cultivation!”

Yang Ye naturally didn’t believe that. He wanted to ask more, but she waved her hand, “In any case, it’s your problem! You decide if you’re doing it!”

She turned around and walked into the bamboo house.

Yang Ye fell silent for a long time, and then he left the Primordial Pagoda.

At the side of the bridge, Yang Ye gazed at the black Boundless Water down below.

Should I jump down there?

If he were being honest, he wasn’t very confident. It was because Qi Bitian wasn’t reliable at all. However, he felt that she wouldn’t send him to his death!

So, to jump down or not to jump?

Yang Ye glanced at the green light around himself and took a deep breath. He felt that he couldn’t rely on others forever!

Jump!

Yang Ye jumped down into the water. As soon as he entered it, Yang Ye felt like a million mountains were pressing down upon him, and his figure started to sink!

The pressure upon him was growing in strength, and Yang Ye felt like his body was about to explode!

At this moment, he couldn’t move, not even a finger!

In the Primordial Pagoda, Qi Bitian stood before the bamboo door and gazed coldly at Yang Ye, “Your weakness will only bring harm to Erya and the others.”

As she spoke, she sat on the steps before the house, “This is considered as suicide, right? Yes, it is. It has nothing to do with me…”
