Chapter 1698 - You’re A Lefty Now!

Book 14 — Revenge and Redemption

Yang Ye’s voice reverberated like thunder through the starry sky.

Yang Xiao and the others’ had extremely unsightly expressions on their faces when they heard Yang Ye.

Yang Ye had fled!

He’d fled while being surrounded and attacked by numerous experts of the Yang Clan.

A day ago, killing Yang Ye was an absolutely easy thing for the Yang Clan. Because he was just a Rebirth Realm expert. So, wasn’t it absolutely simple for the Yang Clan to kill a Rebirth Realm expert?

However, everything far surpassed their expectations.

It wasn’t just Yang Ye’s strength that had surpassed their expectations, Yang Ye’s trump cards had far surpassed their expectations as well.

Yang Ye was just at the Rebirth Realm now. If he attained the Zenith Realm or the True Realm… At that time, could anyone in the Yang Clan stop him when he used the wooden sword and that arm?

Based on Yang Ye’s vengeful character, they had no doubt that he would return to the Yang Clan. When he did so, he would definitely wash the Yang Clan with blood.

Everyone here fell silent, and the atmosphere here was quite suffocating.

A long time passed before Yang Xiao spoke abruptly, “Use all the resources available to my Yang Clan to find him and issue a warrant for him. As for its contents — Yang Ye colluded with outsiders to steal a precious treasure of the Yang Clan. The Yang Clan is willing to reward Yang Ye’s killer with a True Rank treasure and a chance to choose any two True Rank techniques from the Yang Clan’s Technique Pavilion.”

He paused for a moment and continued, “In the event one is unable to kill him, my Yang Clan is still willing to give a True Rank technique for information related to Yang Ye. Besides that, tell our fellow clansmen that Yang Ye is our clan’s number one enemy from now on!”

Yang Gu and the others’ expressions were extremely gloomy, and they remained silent.

Yang Xiao closed his eyes slowly. Suddenly, he turned to look towards the distance. There was a woman there.

Everyone gazed at her.

Yang Xiao gazed at her for a long time and asked, “Why didn’t you help? We would have had a 90% chance of killing him if you helped.”

She shot a sideways glance at Yang Xiao’s group and replied with a question, “Why should I?”

Yang Xiao replied, “You’re a member of the Yang Clan!”

She said, “Isn’t Yang Ye a member of the Yang Clan too?”

Yang Xiao gazed at her for a long time before he said, “Is this what you want?”

She shook her head, “Not entirely!”

Yang Xiao asked, “Are you that desperate to be the Yang Clan’s patriarch?”

She looked him in the eyes and replied, “Yes!”

Yang Xiao and her gaze were locked for a long time before he said, “I feel like killing you right now!”

She shrugged and gestured at them, “Why don’t you give it a try?”

Yang Xiao gazed at her, and he slowly clenched his right fist. A short while later, he slowly closed his eyes and relaxed his clenched fist.

The Yang Clan couldn’t afford to engage in further internal strife.

A short while of silence later, Yang Xiao opened his eyes and gazed at her, “Women can’t inherit the position of patriarch. It’s a rule set by our ancestor!”

She gazed at Yang Xiao, “Our ancestor was pedantic. Are all of you going to be like that too?”

“How dare you!” Yang Xiao shouted angrily, and then he slapped his right palm forward. A black palm instantly flashed out from the space before him, and then it slapped down at her.

Suddenly, she raised her hand and tapped a single finger forward.

Hiss!

A bolt of lightning tore through space, and it blasted Yang Xiao’s attack into bits. However, it didn’t vanish after the collision, and it didn’t even slow down as it instantly arrived before Yang Xiao.

Yang Xiao’s eyes narrowed slightly, and then he slammed his fist forward.

Boom!

The lightning exploded apart in an instant. However, it didn’t vanish. All the strands of electricity created from the explosion returned to the woman, and then they converged together once more to form a completely new bolt of lightning which floated before her.

Yang Xiao glanced at his fist. It was pitch black, and he wasn’t even able to feel it anymore.

A few breaths of silence later, he looked up at her, “The True Realm! No wonder you’re so confident.”

She glanced at Yang Xiao and the others’ before she said, “I’m the future patriarch of the Yang Clan. If the rules set by the ancestor prohibit me from doing so, then I’ll annul his rules; if all of you refuse to let me be the patriarch, then I’ll destroy all of you!”

As soon as she finished speaking, she turned around and left.

Yang Xiao just gazed in that direction for a long time, and then he took a deep breath and said, “She’s grown her wings and can fly solo now!”

Yang Gu spoke in a low voice, “We should have killed her all those years ago!”

Yang Ling shook his head, “She kept a really low profile then!”

Yang Xiao placed his hands behind his back and looked up at the sky. There was a lost expression in his eyes, “Two peerless geniuses appeared in my Yang Clan, but it’s not fortune… Ancestor, is my Yang Clan going to fall into decline?”

Ferocity suddenly flashed into his eyes at this point, “No! I will absolutely not allow the Yang Clan to fall into a decline while it’s in my hands! From this moment onward, I’m going into closed door cultivation! No one is to disturb me!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he vanished on the spot.

A long moment of silence appeared here, and then Yang Gu said, “Is he going to inherit that thing?”

Yang Ling nodded slightly, “He should be!”

Yang Gu sighed softly and didn’t speak further.

It didn’t take long for everyone here to vanish.

Because the Yang Clan sealed off all information related to the incident between Yang Ye and the Yang Clan, it hadn’t spread into the outside world. However, the Yang Clan did issue a warrant for Yang Ye. So, countless people started to look for Yang Ye.

Because the rewards provided by the Yang Clan were extremely tempting, and Yang Ye was only at the Rebirth Realm. As far as many were concerned, killing a Rebirth Realm expert was definitely not difficult at all. So, some had started to search for Yang Ye as they hoped to gain such a windfall.

…

After they fled Heaven Void Continent, Qiong Qi’s figure rushed into the depths of the boundless starry sky.

A long time later, Yang Ye suddenly spoke hoarsely, “I… I can’t hold on for much longer.”

Qiong Qi was just about to speak when Yang Ye’s right hand suddenly slapped down towards Qiong Qi’s back.

Boom!

Qiong Qi was slapped down to the ground, and it didn’t take long for his furious cursing to resound from below, “Kid! What the hell!”

Yang Ye used his left hand to hold tightly onto his right hand, and his entire face had warped.

An Nanjing’s expression changed slightly. Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly spoke, “Don’t! Don’t come closer! I can’t control this hand! It… it’s growing stronger and stronger. I…”

However, An Nanjing still walked over. Suddenly, Yang Ye roared with fury and slapped his palm in her direction.

Her eyelids twitched, and she stabbed Skysplit forward.

Bang!

An explosion resounded, and then both she and her spear were blasted over 10km away. Blood seeped out from both corners of her mouth when she stopped herself.

Suddenly, Yang Ye raised his hand and slapped it at her again, and a strand of extremely powerful energy surged out like a wave.

An Nanjing’s expression changed. She was about to attack when Qiong Qi suddenly appeared before her, and then he raised his right claw and slapped it forward.

Boom! Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

An explosion resounded and Qiong Qi was blasted 3km away.

An Nanjing glanced at Qiong Qi, and her face fell. Because the scales on Qiong Qi’s body had actually cracked open.

Yang Ye was about to attack again when Qiong Qi suddenly spoke, “Hurry! Stick the talisman back on your arm! Hurry!”

Yang Ye was stunned when he heard Qiong Qi, and then he flipped his left palm. The golden talisman appeared in his left grasp before he slapped it on his right arm.

As soon as it was stuck on his arm, Yang Ye’s shaking arm gradually stopped shaking. Even though it was still trembling, it wasn’t that intense anymore. Moreover, his arm was gradually calming down further. Around three breaths of time later, it had calmed down completely.

Qiong Qi and An Nanjing appeared before Yang Ye. An Nanjing’s expression changed again when she saw his arm, “It…”

Yang Ye looked down at his right arm, and he was stunned when he saw it. His right arm was still that right arm with the golden bracer. Yang Ye was stunned for a moment and tried to raise his right arm. However, he was shocked to notice that it didn’t move at all!

Simply speaking, he couldn’t feel his right arm anymore!

Yang Ye gazed at Qiong Qi and An Nanjing, “What’s going on?”

An Nanjing frowned slightly, “What?”

Yang Ye replied, “I can’t feel my arm.”

As he spoke, he raised his left hand and placed it on his right hand. However, his right hand didn’t feel anything! No matter what he did, he couldn’t feel anything from his right hand!

At this moment, Yang Ye fell into slight panic.

Suddenly, Qiong Qi said, “The Wargod’s arm destroyed your original arm!”

Yang Ye looked up at Qiong Qi, “It destroyed my arm? What do you mean?”

Qiong Qi replied, “Your arm was inferior to it, so it replaced your arm. So, now that you’ve sealed it with the talisman, its strength and everything it possesses has been sealed. Thus, you can’t feel it!”

Yang Ye was stunned, “Then what should I do?”

Qiong Qi replied, “What are you worried about? Don’t you still have a right arm? Moreover, it’s even stronger than before. You’re just unable to truly control it. So, if worse comes to worse, you can just avoid using it for now.”

“Avoid using it?” Yang Ye spoke with disbelief, “You’re asking me to avoid using my right hand? Then I should use my left in battle from now on?”

“What else?” Qiong Qi continued, “You can’t fully control the Wargod’s arm right now. Moreover, it was still growing stronger just now. In other words, it may kill you if you remove the seal right now!”

Qiong Qi paused for a moment and continued, “Congratulations, you’re a lefty from now on! Please tell me how you feel!”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.
