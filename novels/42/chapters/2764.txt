Chapter 2765 – Anyone Can Brag!

Face death to live again!

All of them clearly understood what Yang Ye meant.

Needless to say, what he said did make quite a bit of sense to them.

Because in this situation, they had to be prepared for death in order to have a chance at winning.

There was no luck involved!

One side had to die!

At the very least, Yang Ye was prepared for that.

Flee?

He wouldn’t choose to flee this time.

All of them left, and only Ding Shaoyao and Yang Ye remained in the hall.

Ding Shaoyao suddenly said, “This is just the beginning!”

Yang Ye nodded, “I Know!”

She spoke solemnly, “Do you have a plan?”

Yang Ye gazed at Ding Shaoyao and smiled, “What could I possibly have? My plan is to fight, of course. Otherwise, what else can I do?”

She nodded slightly.

Fight!

It was the only choice all the cultivators of the Three Dimensional Universe had.

Because there was nowhere to run to.

Meanwhile, an old man entered the hall, Chen Dao’zi.

Yang Ye gazed at the old man, “Senior, do you need something?”

Chen Dao’zi nodded, “The formation’s essentially ready to be used.”

Yang Ye said, “Tell me about it in detail!”

Chen Dao’zi withdrew a blueprint, and there were some circles and dots on it. He pointed at them and said, “See these? These are the formations I set up throughout the universe. I used Earth Energy to connect them together. So long as it’s activated, all of them will practically simultaneously activate, and the power that would instantly erupt from the formation is entirely capable of annihilating a peak Destiny Realm expert with ease.”

He gazed at Yang Ye, “Even you may not be able to resist this formation.”

Yang Ye was quite surprised, “It’s that strong?”

Chen Dao’zi nodded, “My clan used to make a living from formations, and it can be said that no on in the Three Dimensional Universe can surpass my clan when it comes to formations.”

Chen Dao’zi’s voice was full of confidence.

Yang Ye smiled, “Of course. But how long does it take to activate the formation?”

“Around 15 minutes!” Chen Dao’zi spoke solemnly, “I used the divine vein at its core, and it has sufficient spirit energy. Coupled with the Sprite Progenitor’s assistance, it can be said to be practically without flaws. Of course, if an extraordinary expert were to destroy it by force, there’s nothing we can do.”

Yang Ye nodded, “I see. I’ll leave the formation to you.”

Chen Dao’zi nodded, “Contact me if you want it activated.”

He turned around and left.

Once Chen Dao’zi left, Yang Ye gazed at Ding Shaoyao, “Do you have information on Zuo Mu and the others’ whereabouts?”

She withdrew the Myriad World Diagram and said, “I don’t. However, I can guess where they are.”

Yang Ye was stunned.

Ding Shaoyao said, “They dare not stay in worlds with especially abundant spirit energy. Because they dare not take the risk while you have Snowy.”

She pointed at a few spots and said, “These places have scarce spirit energy, and they are worlds on the verge of destruction. It’s more likely for them to be in these worlds. However, I don’t recommend that you go looking for them! I’m sure you know why!”

Enemies!

Yang Ye naturally understood that she was speaking about their current enemy. They had a powerful enemy right now, and if they were to offend the End World’s mysterious expert now, it was very likely that they would be stuck in between two formidable enemies!

Yang Ye fell silent for a short while and said, “Do you have information on the Unfettered One’s whereabouts?”

She replied with a question, “Are you sure he will help us?”

Yang Ye smiled, “He will!”

“Why?” Ding Shaoyao was quite puzzled, “According to my knowledge, he treats you as his future opponent.”

Yang Ye smiled, “Have you forgotten? He’s the Sword Sect’s founding ancestor, and Qingshi is the current master of the Sword Sect!”

He looked up at outer space and continued, “We will definitely fight, but it shouldn’t be a problem to seek his help before that, and we have no other choice. Our enemy isn’t just strong, they are huge in number. But I don’t have much forces on my side, so they are literally bullying us.”

Ding Shaoyao shook her head and smiled, “Seriously!”Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

She spoke solemnly, “I’ve done everything I could, but I still don’t have any information on him. If I’m not wrong, he should have left the Three Dimensional Universe. However, I’ve sent the Emperor Corpse to search beyond the Three Dimensional Universe. He’s an expert from Destiny’s era, so going outside to search for someone shouldn’t be a problem for him. As for Tian Xiu and Qi Bitian, we don’t have any information on them either.”

Yang Ye spoke softly, “So long as it isn’t the strongest form of Destiny, they should be safe!”

Tian Xiu and Qi Bitian’s strength was something that could definitely keep them safe unless they faced the strongest form of Destiny.

Yang Ye fell silent for a short while and said, “I’m heading out!”

Yang Ye stood up and left the hall.

Ding Shaoyao glanced at Yang Ye and didn’t ask anything.

She would ask what had to be asked, but she wouldn’t ask what shouldn’t be asked. At most times, a person who was too smart would incur the dislike of others.

A short while later, Yang Ye left Universe City.

…

At that place in the clouds. The woman raised a piece and put it down, “Your forces were trash.”

A voice resounded, “I underestimated him!”

She smiled, “It’s not too late. I’ll wait for the good news from you.”

She raised another piece and put it down, and then she smiled, “This boundless universe is like a Go board. What do you think when you see these paws live and die?”

A short while later, the voice replied, “Pawns may become the one who plays.”

A grin with deep meaning arose on the corners of her mouth.

…

Yang Ye left Universe City, and then he fully concealed his aura.

Yang Ye withdrew Great Unknown, and then he vanished on the spot.

Traveling through the universe!

Great Unknown was very convenient when it came to that!

Now that the situation in the universe had stabilized. While everything seemed fine on the surface, Yang Ye was very well aware that the Three Dimensional Universe was surrounded by danger.

Even if the Four Dimensional Universe was ignored, the mysterious experts and the group from the End World were already a threat to them.

If he didn’t resolve this threat, they would definitely strike a lethal blow to Universe City at the critical moment!

A short while later, Yang Ye arrived in a world. It was a world of unknown name, and it was a world where the spirit energy here had dried up completely. The living beings of this world had either perished or fled.

This world hadn’t been destroyed naturally, it was caused by someone!

Yang Ye advanced slowly with his sword in hand. A short while later, he arrived before a mountain.

Suddenly, a woman appeared before him!

Shu Wubian!

Based on her outer appearance alone, she looked like a weak and delicate woman.

Of course, if anyone really thought of her in that way, they would pay a terrible price!

Shu Wubian grinned, “Oh, what brings the great City Governor Yang here today?”

Yang Ye glanced at her and spoke indifferently, “Tell your leader to show himself.”

She grinned, “You think I’ll just do as you say?”

Yang Ye smiled, “I’ve heard about you from the strongest form of Destiny. She said you’re a divine being of this world, and you once brought chaos and slaughter to the world!”

Shu Wubian chuckled, “You know… A very, very long time ago, someone like you wouldn’t even have the right to speak to me.”

Yang Ye tightened his grip on his sheath and smiled, “A very, very long time ago? The past should stay in the past! Now, shall we fight one-on-one?”

Shu Wubian grinned, “That’s exactly what I was planning!”

A pitch black vine instantly appeared below Yang Ye’s feet and wrapped around them. A moment later, they stretched toward his entire body.

Suddenly, Yang Ye flicked with his left thumb.

A sword howl resounded, and then a ray of sword energy flashed and severed all the vines!

However, a wooden hand appeared before Yang Ye!

Yang Ye took a small step back and swung his sword.

Bam!

Yang Ye was instantly pushed 300m back!

Shu Wubian’s beautiful face was quite vicious at this point, “You piece of trash! 100,000 years ago…”

Suddenly, Yang Ye vanished on the spot, and the area where Yang Ye had been was instantly obliterated!

Shu Wubian’s eyes narrowed slightly as she raised her arms to defend herself. In an instant, countless vines weaved together to form a shield.

Boom!

The shield was instantly blasted apart while Shu Wubian was pushed over 1km back. However, Yang Ye didn’t stop there. A ray of sword energy flashed toward Shu Wubian.

Shu Wubian’s face was icy cold as she waved her right hand. A towering pillar surged up from the ground and slammed itself at Yang Ye.

Yang Ye didn’t stop and just swung his sword.

Bam!

The pillar was sliced into bits. A moment later, Yang Ye’s sword slashed down from above Shu Wubian!

Shu Wubian looked up at Yang Ye, and she closed her eyes. In an instant, the ground beneath her shook, and then countless vines stretched out from below. After that, they shot at Yang Ye like venomous snakes.

Yang Ye swung his sword repeatedly in midair!

Explosive Heavenrend combined with the Madness Sword Technique!

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!

In an instant, a dense wave of slashes could be heard in the sky. The vines were ceaselessly sliced into bits, and it didn’t take long for the sword energy to grow closer and closer to Shu Wubian…

“Slash!” A furious shout resounded, and then the vines exploded into bits. At the same time, a figure was blasted over 3km away!

It was Shu Wubian!

As soon as she stopped herself, a strand of dark green liquid seeped out from the corner of her mouth.

She wiped off the blood and looked up at Yang Ye, and then she smiled ferociously, “Even the strongest are bullied at their weakest moment. If it were all those years ago…”

“Cut the crap!” Meanwhile, Yang Ye walked slowly in her direction, “If I was born during that time, would there even be a Destiny? I would have taught her a lesson with a single swing of my sword!”

Shu Wubian was slightly stunned, and then a mocking smile arose on the corners of her mouth.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye cracked a smile, “Anyone can brag!”

Shu Wubian was stunned speechless.
