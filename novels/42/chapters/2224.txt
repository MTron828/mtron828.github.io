Chapter 2225 – I’m Finally Free!

At this moment, Yang Ye was beyond shocked.

The Primordial Armor!

It was an armor that could even defend him against attacks from progenitors, but it was actually melting now!

Moreover, the Samadhi Flame was still sealed!

“Retreat!” Meanwhile, the Universe Sprite’s voice resounded, and then both she and Yang Ye moved extremely far away.

But it was still hot here.

The Universe Sprite formed a seal with both hands. In an instant, a thin barrier appeared before them, and then Yang Ye immediately felt quite better.

Meanwhile, the Samadhi Flame suddenly vanished.

Everything returned to normal, and only the formation was still circulating.

The Universe Sprite spoke solemnly, “It’s extraordinary!”

Yang Ye laughed bitterly, “I know. The problem is how do we subdue it?”

“Subdue it?” The Universe Sprite gazed at him, “Do you think that you can?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “I can’t!”

The Universe Sprite gazed at the Samadhi Flame, “You can’t control a divine treasure like that right now, and the only way to gain its help is by working with it.”

“Working with it?” Yang Ye asked, “How?”

The Universe Sprite didn’t answer him. She looked up at the flame, “I know you are intelligent, so can we talk?”

A moment of silence ensued, and then the Samadhi Flame appeared before them.

“The Primordial Pagoda, Bodhi Tree…” Meanwhile, a voice resounded.

Yang Ye instantly felt something had locked onto him.

Yang Ye gazed at the Samadhi Flame, “Was it the initial race that trapped you here/”

The Samadhi Flame replied with a question, “Who else?”

Yang Ye asked, “Why?”

The flame replied indifferently, “There are ten supreme divine treasures in this world, so who wouldn’t want to possess them all? However, why would we be willing to be enslaved?”

Yang Ye gained a rough understanding at this point.

They had their own intelligence, and they clearly refused to let the initial race take ownership of them. So, they fought, and the Samadhi Flame clearly lost.

The Universe Sprite suddenly asked, “Why didn’t they take you by force?”

The Samadhi Flame replied, “If I detonate myself, I can take this entire large universe with me!”

Yang Ye was stunned speechless.

The Universe Sprite fell silent too.

Self-detonation!

If the Samadhi Flame detonated itself, then just as it had said, the entire large universe would be obliterated. Perhaps the initial race could stop that, but they would definitely suffer tremendous losses if that happened.

It was a price they didn’t want to pay, so they chose to seal it and not destroy it!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly said, “We can save you!”

The Samadhi Flame replied, “Conditions!”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and said, “It’s very simple. I hope you’ll stay with me for 20 years. Help me during these 20 years, and you’re free after. Alright?” Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Make it submit?

Of course Yang Ye wanted that, but he wouldn’t do that. He was no fool!

20 years!

The Samadhi Flame fell silent for a short while, and then it said, “The conditions are beneficial to me, but do you know about this formation?”

Yang Ye shook his head.

The Samadhi Flame said, “Both of you are quite strong, but if you want to destroy this formation, you need…”

Yang Ye suddenly asked, “What’s the core of this formation?”

The Samadhi Flame asked, “What are you trying to say?”

Yang Ye smiled, “The core of this formation is spirit energy, so how will it exist without spirit energy?”

The Samadhi Flame replied, “It can protect itself, so it’s impossible for you to extract all the spirit energy within it!”

Yang Ye smiled, “I think it’s possible!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he summoned Snowy.

“The Sprite Lord?” The Samadhi Flame’s voice had quite a bit of surprise in it.

Yang Ye nodded and gazed at Snowy, “Snowy, can you take away all the spirit energy in that formation?”

Spirit energy!

His thoughts were very simple, and it was to make her take the spirit energy. Once it was gone, the formation would be useless.

Snowy glanced at the formation, thought for a moment, and then she flew over to it. To Yang Ye and the Universe Sprite’s surprise, the formation wasn’t triggered, and she could just jump about happily there.

“It doesn’t sense danger!” Meanwhile, the Universe Sprite spoke solemnly, “The formation doesn’t sense danger, so it won’t be triggered. Snowy is a Sprite Lord too, and the formation can’t do without spirit energy. But that spirit energy won’t feel threatened by the Sprite Lord, so it isn’t being triggered!”

Yang Ye nodded. Meanwhile, Snowy had arrived at the center of the formation. She looked around, and then she slapped her paw down upon the formation.

Bang!

The entire formation shook violently, and then countless strands of spirit energy seeped out from the formation. In just a short while, the spirit energy in the formation was completely extracted.

Why did spirit energy like Snowy?

It was mainly because being absorbed by her would not consume any spirit energy. Other living beings, including humans, would devour spirit energy upon taking it into themselves so that they can strengthen themselves. But Snowy didn’t do that. Because of her physique, the spirit energy she absorbed would converge within her and not vanish. Moreover, they would grow purer within her!

So, spirit energy didn’t reject Snowy at all!

In just a short while, Snowy had absorbed all the spirit energy in the formation. At the same time, the glow of the formation gradually waned and vanished.

Yang Ye hurriedly told Snowy to return to his side.

Once the formation vanished, the temperature here suddenly rose, and the four chains in the air gradually turned ethereal.

They were being burned!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly said, “Couldn’t you destroy the formation with your strength?”

“Do you know what makes it amazing?” The Samadhi Flame’s voice resounded, “It’s able to restrain my ability.”

As soon as those words were spoken, a flame appeared before Yang Ye.

Yang Ye became secretly vigilant.

The Samadhi Flame explained, “The initial race is known for its formations, and their technique is simply godly. Otherwise, they wouldn’t have been able to move their entire race away. Even the undying race cannot teleport that far yet!”

Yang Ye said, “You know about the undying race!”

“Where there’s flames, there I am!” The Samadhi Flame floated over to Yang Ye and said, “Human, aren’t you afraid that I’ll turn back on my word?”

Yang Ye smiled, “You’re someone with status at any rate. Existences like you take dignity and pride very seriously. Otherwise, you wouldn’t have chosen to be sealed than submit to the initial race. Thus, I think that you disdain to lie.”

Actually, he was just guessing. He wasn’t sure if the Samadhi Flame would go back on its word. But no matter what, it was best to flatter it first.

A short while passed before it replied, “Human, you’re quite interesting. You’re right, I disdain to lie. We have an agreement, and I’ll keep my word. 20 years are like a nap to me. However, you’re too weak right now and cannot endure my strength. Especially your body, if you use my strength now, then both your body and soul won’t be able to endure it!”

Yang Ye asked, “Then what do I do?”

The Samadhi Flame replied, “How do I know?”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

Swish!

Suddenly, it entered Yang Ye’s forehead, and then a thumb-sized flame mark appeared on his forehead.

At the same time, the Samadhi Flame’s voice resounded in his mind, “I’m a little weak, so I need Primordial Violet Energy. But I won’t take it for free.”

As soon as it finished speaking, a faint layer of flames appeared around Yang Ye.

Yang Ye was puzzled, “What is this?”

Suddenly, the flames merged into the Primordial Armor, and then Yang Ye felt that the Primordial Armor was undergoing a tremendous transformation!

A qualitative transformation!

The Samadhi Flame replied, “Now, it can be described as being impenetrable!”

Impenetrable!

Yang Ye touched the Primordial Armor. After it had been enhanced by the Samadhi Flame, it was many times stronger than it had been. Now, even a progenitor would find it almost impossible to penetrate!

A smile couldn’t help but curl up on the corners of Yang Ye’s mouth. He’d gained a lot on this trip!

Meanwhile, the Universe Sprite said, “Let’s go!”

Yang Ye nodded. Suddenly, the Samadhi Flame said, “There’s an altar in the city, and there’s a Demonspawn in it. I can sense its aura, so don’t get close to that altar.”

“A Demonspawn?” Yang Ye frowned slightly, “What is that?”

The Samadhi Flame replied, “Something you’re no match for, so don’t offend it. Moreover, it’s about to emerge into the world, so leave immediately!”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and smiled, ``The Initial said you’re a Demonic Artifact, but after coming into contact with you, I don’t think you’re a demon.”

“You don’t have to look ferocious and act with malice to be considered a demon. I’m naturally called a demon because…”

The Samadhi Flame stopped abruptly at this point.

Yang Ye sensibly chose not to ask. It was meaningless to him. Of course, he left with the Universe Sprite, and it didn’t take long for them to enter the boundless reaches of space.

Once they left, a middle aged man descended onto the continent.

He wore a cloud white robe, had his hands behind his back, and emanated an indescribable aura.

The middle aged man glanced at the direction Yang Ye and the Universe Sprite had left toward, and then he walked slowly into the city. He was walking in the direction of where Yang Ye and the Universe Sprite had spoken to the Initial, but he suddenly stopped after walking for a while. He turned to the left, and an altar was visible in his field of vision.

The middle aged man frowned slightly and withdrew his gaze. Suddenly, the altar trembled, and it started to shake more and more. A short while later, a terrifying aura surged out from it!

It was a monstrous aura!

“HAHA!” Meanwhile, roaring laughter resounded from there, “I’m finally free! Haha!”

An instant later, a huge and terrifying claw stretched out from the altar and claws at the middle aged man.
