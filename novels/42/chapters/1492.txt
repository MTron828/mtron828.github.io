Chapter 1493 - Hello! Little Little Sky!

Translator: InVader

The Ominous City. Noon.

A middle aged man in a luxurious robe and a middle aged man in an embroidered robe appeared out of thin air at the entrance of Ominous City.

The middle aged man in a luxurious robe smiled, “Di Jiang, how long has it been since you came down here last?”

The man in an embroidered robe, Di Jiang, glanced at the surroundings, “I don’t remember.”

The other middle aged man chuckled, “What do you think?”

Di Jiang spoke indifferently, “Let’s talk about that once we’re done with that woman!”

The middle aged man asked, “How confident are you?”

A moment of silence ensued before Di Jiang spoke indifferently, “90%.”

90%! The middle aged man withdrew his smile, fell silent for a few moments, and then said, “She’s not ordinary.”

“The 2nd hall master of Nether Pavilion. How could she possibly be ordinary?” Di Jiang spoke indifferently, “If it was during the time she was at her prime, then not to mention the two of us, even two more wouldn’t be able to do anything to her. However, it’s different now. She’s heavily injured now. Moreover, her cultivation has dropped and it’s the critical moment for her advancement. As for us, not only has our strength not dropped, it has grown stronger over the years. So, how could she possibly be a match for us?”

The middle aged man said, “I’m worried about Sky Maiden. Even the Oracle can’t deduce her whereabouts. It’s like she has completely vanished. If she comes…”

Di Jiang’s face was instantly covered in a solemn expression.

Sky Maiden!

That name had once instilled horror in the large world. At that time, no more than a handful could fight her.

Di Jiang remained silent for a moment before he shook his head, “Since the Oracle said she won’t be here, then she probably won’t be here.”

The middle aged man in a luxurious robe said, “What if she does?”

Di Jiang gazed at the middle aged man, “Zhan Yuan, when did you become so cowardly? If she comes, then she comes. Are you telling me that we need to fear her? Do they still possess the same strength that they used to possess?”

Zhan Yuan shook his head, “You’re from the generation after them, so you never fought them and don’t know how terrifying they are. Every single one of them is a monstrous genius… Forget it, since we’re here, then we can only march forward bravely. If the 2nd Hall Master is able to advance to the Rebirth Realm, then it’ll definitely be a calamity for all of us!”

Di Jiang nodded, “She must die today.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he took a step forward and vanished without a trace. Zhan Yuan vanished with him. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

…

The Ominous Territory.

As soon as Di Jiang and Zhan Yuan’s figures vanished, Blood Maiden suddenly opened her eyes and looked up towards the sky, “They’re here.”

As soon as she finished speaking, she waved her right hand and sent both Yang Ye and Lian Banzhuang around 30km away.

At the moment they vanished, Di Jiang and Zhan Yuan appeared in the sky above her.

Once they appeared here, numerous divine senses swept towards them from all directions. Obviously, it was the other human experts and demon beasts in the Ominous Territory.

Di Jiang glances at the surroundings, “We’re only here for her, and we’ll leave once we kill her.”

As soon as they heard Di Jiang, those divine senses were instantly retracted like a receding tide.

Yang Ye had an extremely solemn expression on his face as he gazed at the two middle aged men in the sky.

Rebirth Realm experts!

Even though they’d been suppressed to the Dualism Realm, they were Rebirth Realm experts! Something worth mentioning was that one’s cultivation wouldn’t be suppressed here. However, they hadn’t come here directly. They’d descended to the lower dimensions from the large world, and their cultivations had been instantly suppressed when they descended.

While this place was an independent world, it still belonged to the lower dimensions. So, one’s cultivation in the outside world would remain the same when one entered this place. Similarly, if someone left this place, that person’s cultivation would be suppressed as well!

Based on what Blood Maiden told him, it’s a law that the Supreme Heaven Dao had created. No one dared to violate that law because anyone who did would be treated as an enemy of the Supreme Heaven Dao.

Even though Rebirth Realm experts were extremely strong, they didn’t want to be constantly pursued by the Eye of the Heaven Dao!

Di Jiang’s gaze descended onto Blood Maiden, “2nd Hall Master of the Nether Pavilion, your reputation precedes you.”

Blood Maiden transformed into a veil of blood that appeared before them. She glanced at them and said, “Did the Emperor Sect and War Pavilion just send both of you?”

“Are we not enough?” Di Jiang spoke indifferently, “Blood Maiden, if you’re at your prime, then even both of us would have to fear you. However, your strength hasn’t just declined, you’re even injured. Moreover, you have to suppress your cultivation. If I’m to be honest, just I alone am enough.”

“You alone?” Blood Maiden gazed at Di Jiang while an evil smile curled up on the corners of her mouth, “In the past, I could fight 10 of you without breaking a sweat.”

“How laughable!” Di Jiang laughed with ridicule, “Blood Maiden, your Nether Pavilion really is filled with arrogant members. No wonder all of you were crushed all those years ago.”

“Crushed?” The evil smile on her face became ferocious, “Don’t worry, once I return to the large world, then everything all of you did to us sisters all those years ago, I’ll do 10,000 times worse to all of you!”

Di Jiang spoke indifferently, “Don’t worry, you won’t be alive to return to the large world.”

Blood Maiden chuckled, “By the way, is that bitch, the Oracle, still alive?”

Di Jiang replied, “She said she’ll only die after she watches all of you die.”

“As expected!” Blood Maiden nodded, “If it wasn’t for her, both of you wouldn’t have been able to come here at such a time. It’s fine, I’ll personally head up there and send her on her way!”

As soon as she finished speaking, Blood Maiden vanished on the spot. A moment later, the sky was transformed into an ocean of blood. The ocean of blood was boundless, and it seemed to cover the entire sky. It didn’t take long for rumbling to resound from the ocean of blood. At this moment, the entire forbidden area of the Ominous Territory was trembling.

At the same time, countless demon beasts and human experts here were watching the battle.

Yang Ye and Lian Banzhuang had solemn expressions on their faces.

The pressure coming from the ocean of blood was extremely terrifying. Just the aura felt extremely dangerous to Yang Ye. Lian Banzhuang’s face was extremely solemn as well. Even though all three of them in the sky were at the Dualism Realm, their true strength was at the Rebirth Realm.

So, Yang Ye wasn’t the only one who sensed danger, she too sensed danger!

Yang Ye naturally didn’t try to interfere. He couldn’t interfere in a battle that was at such a level. If he were to forcefully interfere, it would only cause trouble for Blood Maiden! So, he had no choice but to just watch!

The battle in the sky grew more and more intense, and even the sky and the ground here had started to tremble violently. The reason it felt like that was because the ground and space here were trembling violently.

It was a truly shocking scene!

Meanwhile, worry had appeared in Yang Ye’s eyes. He was naturally worried about Blood Maiden. He was very close with the sisters from the Nether Pavilion, and Blood Maiden was quite good to him. Moreover, if she lost, then who would send him out of this place? Those two fellows from the large world? That would be impossible! If Blood Maiden loses the battle, they may even kill him and Lian Banzhuang!

So, Blood Maiden could absolutely not lose. Unfortunately, he could do nothing to help. A battle at this level wasn’t something he could interfere in at all!

Lian Banzhuang spoke in a low voice, “Which side will win?”

Yang Ye fell silent. If it was a one on one battle, then he had no doubt that Blood Maiden would be the strongest. However, it was a two on one battle! Moreover, the biggest problem was that Blood Maiden was suppressing her cultivation. She had to divide a portion of her strength to suppress her cultivation while dealing with two Rebirth Realm experts.

That was extremely disadvantageous to her.

The battle grew more and more intense. Yang Ye noticed that cracks had actually appeared in space. Even though those cracks were very fine like strands of hair, they were there.

Is the space here going to collapse?

Yang Ye wasn’t the only one who had such thoughts. Lian Banzhuang’s eyes were filled with shock when she witnessed this scene. The space here was extraordinarily strong, but the battle between those three fellows had actually been able to crack the space here. Even though the damage wasn’t severe, it was very likely that the space here would collapse if the battle carried on!

Around an hour later.

Crack!

A loud and clear crack resounded through the entire forbidden area of the Ominous Territory. After that, Yang Ye and Lian Banzhuang watched with astonishment as the space in the entire sky cracked apart. Crack after crack started spreading swiftly towards the surroundings, and it seemed like an astounding spiderweb!

Meanwhile, Lian Banzhuang spoke solemnly, “Trouble is coming!”

Sure enough, as soon as she finished speaking, a terrifying wave of pressure suddenly appeared in the surroundings. Yang Ye’s figure instantly curved before the pressure, and he was almost pressed flat on the ground.

What’s that? Yang Ye was shocked, and he hurriedly released his sword intent and slaughter intent. As soon as those two intents appeared around him, his body finally recovered slowly. However, the pressure still pressed down upon him to the point that he felt slightly suffocated!

Meanwhile, Lian Banzhuang suddenly pointed up towards the sky, “Look over there!”

Yang Ye looked along the direction she pointed towards. At this moment, a huge eye suddenly appeared there.

The Eye of the Heaven Dao!

This Eye of the Heaven Dao was quite similar to the Eye of the Heaven Dao that Yang Ye had seen in the past. However, it was much larger than them.

At this moment, the battle in the sky had stopped. Regardless of whether it was Di Jiang or Zhan Yuan, both had a wisp of seriousness and fear in their eyes. Not to mention the current strength they possessed, even if they possessed the strength they had at their prime, they still wouldn’t dare to go against that Eye of the Heaven Dao!

There wasn’t any seriousness on Blood Maiden’s face, and there was only a trace of caution in her eyes!

All three of them didn’t attack. The reason they didn’t attack was naturally because they were afraid it would attract the attention of the Eye of the Heaven Dao, causing it to target them. Regardless of whether it was Di Jiang’s group or Blood Maiden, it would definitely be a calamity for them if the Eye of the Heaven Dao targeted them!

Suddenly, five multicolored bolts of lightning surged out from the Eye of the Heaven Dao, and they shot down towards the five people here.

It was naturally Blood Maiden, Di Jiang, Zhan Yuan, Yang Ye, and Lian Banzhuang!

Yang Ye’s eyelids twitched at the sight of this. What the heck! I didn’t even offend it!

Suddenly, a ray of white light surged out from Yang Ye’s chest. The white light dispersed, and Little Sky appeared by Yang Ye’s side.

Yang Ye was stunned. He was just about to speak when Little Sky suddenly looked up at the Eye of the Heaven Dao. After that, she waved at the Eye of the Heaven Dao and smiled playfully, “Hello! Little Little Sky! Long time no see! Wow, you’ve actually become so huge! Congratulations!”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.
