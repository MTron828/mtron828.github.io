Chapter 1999 – Through Thick and Thin!

The people outside?

Everyone here was quite stunned. But it didn’t take long for them to think of something, and their faces fell.

Meanwhile, the Blood Demon King said, “Be a little more specific!”

A’Man led the others out of the teleportation formation and said, “When we were about to get to the space outside, we were besieged by a group of people. Luckily, we immediately turned around and came back here. Otherwise, all of us would have died in the spatial pathway!”

The Blood Demon King’s face instantly became gloomy when he heard her.

He wasn’t the only one, everyone else here had quite a gloomy expression on their faces!

The people outside clearly knew what was happening here, and their intentions were obvious as well.

They didn’t want to let the people in the Dead Dimension escape to the outside world!

They wanted all the living beings here to perish with the Dead Dimension!

Meanwhile, someone suddenly asked, “Why are they doing this?”

A’Man shook her head slightly, and then she gazed at the Blood Demon King, and everyone else looked at him too. Obviously, the Blood Demon King should know the answer.

The Blood Demon King closed his eyes slowly, “Fear! Those races of the large universe fear the humans and demon beasts from the Dead Dimension. If we enter their world, it’ll definitely impact the situation in the large universe. Moreover, practically all the humans and demon beasts that grew up in the Dead Dimension are stronger than those cultivators in the outside world! So, how could they not fear us?”

Gu Ku spoke in a low voice, “They refuse to give us any chance to survive!”

The Blood Demon King chuckled, “The overall situation in the large universe is fixed. If we leave, it’ll definitely impact them, and it’s something they aren’t willing to see. So, the best way is to stop us from ever leaving!”

All of them fell silent.

Suddenly, the Blood Demon King chuckled, and then he gazed at Gu Ku, “Go notify all the other humans who are still in hiding. Not just them, notify all the other living beings in the Dead Dimension. Tell them to come to Southern Qilin Mountain if they want to leave this place!”

Gu Ku said, “Are you planning on…”

The Blood Demon King nodded slightly, “Everyone will die if we don’t work together!”

…

In a room.

Only Yang Ye and the others were here. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Yang Ye glanced at A’Man and the others, “All of you can’t leave as well?” He hadn’t forgotten that all of them had the backing of a clan or organization.

A’Man was about to speak when she suddenly frowned, and then she gradually closed her eyes. A’Man wasn’t the only one, many others acted strangely just like her. Some time passed before A’Man opened her eyes, and she said, “I received a message from my clan!”

Yang Ye asked, “What is it?”

She replied, “They asked me to go outside again. My clansmen will be there to get me!”

Yu Jing said, “I got a similar message!”

Ling’s voice resounded, “Me too!”

It didn’t take long for many to express that they had someone to get them on the outside, and only nine of them hadn’t received such messages. Actually, there were ten if Yang Ye was included!

Yang Ye nodded slightly, “That’s good. Come, let’s go to the teleportation formation and send all of you outside!”

Yu Jing said, “We’ll go together!”

Someone asked, “Can we?”

The corners of Yu Jing’s mouth twitched, but he didn’t say anything in the end. Because the message he received said that only he could leave.

It was a pass to leave that his clan had gotten for him, and it was only valid for a single person!

“Let me talk to them!” Yu Jing closed his eyes, and it didn’t take long for the space before him to tremble slightly. Some time passed before Yu Jing opened his eyes again. He didn’t say anything, but his face was quite gloomy.

Everyone knew what the answer was!

The room fell silent.

Some time passed before Yang Ye stood up, “Come, I’ll send all of you off!”

Yang Ye walked out of the room.

It didn’t take long for them to arrive before the teleportation formation. The atmosphere here was quite heavy.

Yang Ye smiled, “Don’t act like this. All of you are just heading out first. It won’t take long for us to meet again.” He gazed at A’Man and continued, “Big Sis, take them with you!”

A’Man fell silent for a long time, and then she gazed at Mad Saber, “Mad Saber, you take them with you!”

Mad Saber was puzzled, “What?”

She looked up at the sky. The sky was gray and dark, and she grinned, “I want to stay here for a while longer!”

Yang Ye wanted to say something, but she waved her hand, “I’ve made my decision, so there’s no need to say anything!”

Yang Ye glanced at her, shook his head, and didn’t say anything. Because he knew that it was pointless!

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts, gazed at Mad Saber, and was about to speak when Mad Saber spoke first, “I’m not leaving too!”

All of them gazed at Mad Saber, and the latter chuckled, “I want to stay here a while longer too!”

“That’s exactly what I was thinking!” Meanwhile, Yu Jing suddenly smiled, “After staying in this damnable place for so many years, I’m really quite reluctant to leave. So, I’ve decided to stay a while longer!”

Someone else declared, “I’m not leaving too!”

It didn’t take long for them to declare that they refused to leave.

Regardless of whether it was A’Man, Yu Jing, and the others, all of them were very well aware that if Yang Ye and the others wanted to leave too, they may have to kill their way out. However, their chances were clearly very slim when there were those experts out there, so they didn’t want Yang Ye and the mothers to fight alone!

Yang Ye glanced at them and shook his head, “This isn’t necessary!”

A’Man said, “We’ve made our decision!”

Yang Ye was about to speak when a voice came from the side, “I want to leave!”

Everyone looked towards the source of the voice. It was a man who said that, his name was Yu Qing.

Yu Qing gazed at Yang Ye, “I want to leave!”

Yang Ye nodded slightly.

He was about to speak when Yu Qing spoke before him, “I know that leaving at a time like this isn’t something a loyal brother should do.” He closed his eyes at this point and spoke in a trembling voice, “Brother, I really want to leave!”

Yang Ye walked over to him and smiled, “We don’t blame you!”

Yu Qing opened his eyes, and tears flickered within them, “I’m from a declining clan in the human race. She and I were childhood sweethearts, and we promised ourselves to each other. However, my clan suffered decline, and so her clan refused to let us be together. Her clan said that they would agree with the condition that I’m able to attain the Dao Realm within three years. So, I came to the Dead Dimension, and I’m at the Dao Realm now!”

His hands were trembling at this point, “Tomorrow is the last day. If I don’t leave now, she’ll think that I gave up on her. She once told me that if I’m not there, at the place we agreed to meet, at sunset, she’ll dig out her eyes and heart to punish herself for trusting the wrong person.”

When he spoke up to this point, tears were seeping out of his eyes, “There are many things you can’t control when you’re born in a clan. If I can’t prove my potential to her clan, then she’ll be sacrificed by her clan by forming a union with a different clan, just to benefit her own clan.”

Suddenly, A’Man spoke in an indisputable tone, “Go back! Right now!”

Yang Ye nodded as well, “Don’t disappoint her. Go home. As for us, do you think we would blame you?”

Yu Qing was clearly in pain, “I don’t want to leave all of you and leave by myself. I would never forgive myself if anything happens to all of you!”

“What the hell are you talking about?!” Yu Jing was displeased, “Do you know how to speak? What do you mean if something happens to us? What can possibly happen to us? Just stop being so hesitant and go to your girl! Don’t disappoint her feelings for you!”

All of the others nodded.

Yang Ye said, “Loyalty between brothers depends on the situation. It’s pointless to do that now. Moreover, if your relationship with her is spoiled because of us, then we’ll really feel guilty forever!”

A’Man spoke as well, “Stop hesitating and fuck off. If we do die, we’ll leave our burials to you!”

The faces of the others darkened because even A’Man didn’t know how to speak!

Yu Qing intended to say more, but Yang Ye grabbed him and tossed him into the teleportation formation.

A moment later, a ray of blue light enveloped Yu Qing, and then he vanished on the spot.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye gazed at A’Man and the others, “Big Sis, Mad Saber, and the rest of you. Are you really not going?”

A’Man shook her head slightly.

Yang Ye spoke in a low voice, “This really isn’t necessary. We…”

A’Man suddenly said, “When did you become so indecisive?”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

A’Man said, “We said we aren’t leaving, so we aren’t; if we’re leaving, we’re leaving together. Or do you think we’re too weak to stay?”

Yang Ye laughed bitterly, “What are you talking about?”

A’Man walked over to Yang Ye, “We don’t want to leave the few of you to fight alone. We go through thick and thin together! If we’re leaving, we’re leaving together, or we all stay!”

Qin Chuan chuckled, “Big Sis is right. We met in this damnable place and got along with each other, so that means there’s fate between us. Yet now, you’re asking brothers who’ve gone through life and death together to leave first? We would truly be eternally regretful if we did that!”

Yu Jing chimed in as well, “So, Brother Yang, don’t try to persuade us. You should think about how to get all of us out of here instead!”

Yang Ye glanced at them and fell silent for a long time before he chuckled, “Alright, I refuse to believe that the Dead Dimension can stop us brothers! We’ll kill our way out together!”

Kill their way out together!
