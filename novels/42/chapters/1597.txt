Chapter 1598 - Heaven Obliteration!

Translator: InVader

Yang Ye asked, “The Lord of the Heaven Dao is a treasure?”

Blood Maiden shook her head, “I’m not sure what she is, but she can become a treasure. If some formidable equipment refiners are able to make her into a treasure’s spirit while forging it, that treasure…”

She paused for a moment and continued, “Not only can she be refined into an equipment spirit, she has many other uses. For example, controlling her is equivalent to controlling Merak System. It’s even to the extent that she can be refined into a treasure that has a world of its own, just like the treasure within you!”

Yang Ye was astounded, “She can be refined into a treasure like the treasure I possess?”

Blood Maiden nodded.

Yang Ye fell silent for a short while, and then he said, “Don’t other worlds have a Lord of the Heaven Dao?”

Blood Maiden explained, “Not every world has a Lord of the Heaven Dao. What’s a Lord of the Heaven Dao? It’s one who has obtained the support of all things in a world. I’m sure you’ve seen how they support Little Sky. Now, my Nether Pavilion and some other powers consider her to be the Lord of the Heaven Dao.”

Yang Ye fell silent. Actually, he felt she was the Lord of the Heaven Dao as well. Actually, everyone felt that she was the Lord of the Heaven Dao. Yet now, Little Sky had become a precious treasure that everyone wanted.

Blood Maiden glanced at Yang Ye and spoke softly, “You’re an extraordinary genius, and you’ll definitely be extraordinary in the future. Listen to me and leave this world. Don’t get mixed up in this. It’s not something that you can interfere with right now.”

Yang Ye gazed at her, “Second Sister, I would definitely leave if I didn’t know Little Sky and wasn’t friends with her. However, I’m friends with her. If I take the others and leave Merak System now, then I would never be able to rest at ease. As far as I’m concerned, life should be lived without any regrets.”

A wisp of complicated emotions flashed through her eyes, “You little fellow…”

Yang Ye said, “Second Sister, all of you intend to act against Little Sky as well?”

Blood Maiden fell silent for a long time, and then she said, “If it was in the past, we would definitely support the Nether Pavilion. Yet now, the Pavilion Master isn’t the same Pavilion Master from before. To be honest, we sisters don’t want to stay in the current Nether Pavilion! Moreover, we don’t want to come here and fight Little Sky either. Of course, we don’t want to make things difficult for you too!”

Yang Ye heaved a sigh of relief in his heart. He was afraid that they would end up in battle with Little Sky. Fortunately, Blood Maiden and the others had no intention to fight Little Sky.

Meanwhile, Blood Maiden continued, “However, there are many times in life when you have no other choice.” She gazed at Yang Ye, paused for a moment, and continued, “I came to tell you that the situation here is getting more and more complicated. Since you intend to get yourself mixed up in it, then be prepared for the worst!”

Yang Ye nodded, “I will!”

Blood Maiden nodded, “Take care!” Her figure shook and transformed into a ray of blood red light that vanished into the sky.

Right after Blood Maiden left, Little Sky appeared in front of Yang Ye.

Yang Ye gazed at her and asked, “Are you the Lord of the Heaven Dao?”

Little Sky fell silent for a long time, and then she shook her head, “I don’t know. I really don’t know.”

Yang Ye said, “Don’t those friends of yours know who you are?”

Little Sky gazed at him, “They are just like all of you. They think I’m the Lord of the Heaven Dao too. Sometimes, I too feel that I’m the Lord of the Heaven Dao, but I also feel like it’s not completely true.”

Yang Ye shook his head, “You can’t even remember who you are. You really had a terrible nap.”

Little Sky looked up at the sky, “I may not have another chance to sleep.”

Yang Ye walked over to her and rubbed her head gently, “Don’t be too worried. It’ll be fine.”

Little Sky gazed at Yang Ye, and a long time passed before she said, “I’m not worried, and I’m not afraid. I’m serious.”

Yang Ye smiled, “Good.”

She nodded, “Remember the fist technique I told you about?”

A wisp of excitement flashed through Yang Ye’s eyes, “You’re willing to give it to me now?”

Little Sky said, “I’ve thought about many things during the last few days, and I’ve figured out a lot of things. I don’t like destruction, but if there’s life, then there’s destruction. Just like how there are bad people if there are good people.”

She gazed at Yang Ye and continued, “I didn’t give it to you in the past because I was afraid that you would damage this world. But now, you won’t harm this world, right?”

“Of course!” Yang Ye spoke seriously. Even though he’d thought about defying the heavens in the past, it depended on who the heavens was. Right now, Little Sky might be that ‘heavens’, and Little Sky was his friend. So, if anyone tried to defy the heavens now, he would help Little Sky crush that person!

Little Sky smiled, “Come, let’s head inside!”

It didn’t take long for them to arrive in the 3rd level of the Primordial Pagoda. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Little Sky said, “This fist technique is called Heaven Obliteration, and it was specially created by one fellow to counter Eyes of the Heaven Dao.”

Yang Ye was quite surprised, “It was made to deal with Eyes of the Heaven Dao. Isn’t it similar to that technique of mine, Point at the Heavens?

However, that technique of his could only be used against ordinary Eyes of the Heaven Dao, and it wasn’t a threat to the Eye of the Heaven Dao in medium worlds.

Little Sky nodded, “That fellow was constantly shouting about defying the heavens. In the end, I dealt with him.”

She gazed at Yang Ye and continued, “If the Heaven Dao is unfair, then it should be defied. But some people try to defy it for no reason. Such people deserve death.”

Yang Ye laughed bitterly, “Why are you looking at me? I'm not trying to defy the heavens. Tell me about the technique!”

Little Sky nodded, “Even though that fellow was a terrible person, his strength wasn’t bad at all. The reason I forced him to reveal this technique to me was because I wanted to find out about the weaknesses that Little Little Sky and the others have. After I studied it, I realized that this technique was not bad at all.”

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and asked, “That technique is called Heaven Obliteration, so does it not affect you?”

“Hmph!” Little Sky laughed coldly, “I was very, very powerful in the past!”

Yang Ye hurriedly nodded, “Right! Right! You were extremely powerful! Come, let’s talk about Heaven Obliteration.”

Little Sky explained, “Actually, it’s very simple. It should be very simple for you. Just take a look for yourself.” She tapped the center of Yang Ye’s forehead.

In an instant, a string of information entered Yang Ye’s mind.

Around 15 minutes later, Yang Ye had fully received all the information.

Heaven Obliteration Fist!

Needless to say, it was even stronger than the Elemental Breaker technique. Even the Elemental Breaker combined with the ability to make energy rebound couldn’t compete with Heaven Obliteration.

The most important part about Heaven Obliteration was the word obliteration. It was the core of the technique. Simply speaking, it didn’t just require physical strength, it required Death Energy.

A normal person would only possess vitality and no Death Energy. Fortunately, the technique had a mental cultivation method which helped convert vitality into Death Energy, and then combine it with one’s physical strength to execute Heaven Obliteration.

Once both were merged together, the strength erupted from the technique would be extremely terrifying.

Meanwhile, Little Sky said, “This technique harms the balance of the world. I didn’t want to give it to you, but you’re too weak right now. Your strength is very insufficient when facing some true experts. So, if you have this fist technique, you’ll have the ability to fight even against an expert like the spear-wielding man from today. At the very least, you won’t be completely suppressed in battle!”

Yang Ye glanced at her, and his heart felt quite warm, “Thank you.”

She shook her head, “Take your friends and loved ones with you, and leave this place!”

Yang Ye asked, “What are you trying to say?”

She replied, “That woman from before was right. It’s best that you don’t get mixed up in this. With the natural talent and potential you have, you’ll…”

“Little Sky!” Yang Ye suddenly interrupted her, “Hearing you say that makes me quite unhappy. Is it because you think I’m too weak?”

Little Sky shook her head, “Actually, you’re quite strong, especially with the Stellar Sword Diagram and that flame of yours. However, those enemies of mine are even stronger. You’re too young right now, so you can’t fight them. Understand?”

Yang Ye smiled, “I know. But I’m still going to stay. Because we’re friends. So long as I’m not a burden to you, then I’ll stay to face it with you.” Yang Ye was a person who never betrayed those who hadn’t betrayed him.

It could be said that if it wasn’t for Little Sky, he would have been dead a long time ago. Even though she’d never helped him fight a battle, she’d really helped him a lot. Now, Little Sky was in danger, so how could he just abandon her?

Little Sky gazed at Yang Ye for a long time before she said, “You’re really an idiot!”

Yang Ye smiled, and then he rubbed her head gently, “No matter what, I’ll face those invaders with you.”

After talking with Little Sky for a while longer, Yang Ye started cultivating the Heaven Obliteration fist technique. He had to grasp it before those experts arrived in Merak System. Only then would he be able to help Little Sky.

Yang Ye gradually started to grasp it with Little Sky’s guidance. However, he still wasn’t able to execute it. Because he still wasn’t very skilled at converting his own vitality into Death Energy.

Just like that, time trickled by.

A month later.

Yang Ye stood on a huge rock in the 1st level.

His eyes were closed, and he seemed like a monk that was meditating. Suddenly, he opened his eyes and clenched his right fist.

Crack!

At the instant he clenched his fist, the space around him cracked apart.

Suddenly, his expression changed drastically, and then a wave of force shot towards him from behind, and it slammed against him before he could even react.

Boom!

Yang Ye was blasted away!

A surprise attack!

Someone had launched a surprise attack against him!
