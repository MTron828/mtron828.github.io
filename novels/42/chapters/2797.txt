Chapter 2798 – Every Word Stabs the Heart!

Ignition!

It was ignition of the body and soul!

Ding Shaoyao was very well aware that once Emperor Li caught her, it would be extremely disadvantageous to Yang Ye. At that time, Yang Ye would have to do as Emperor Li said.

She didn’t want to be humiliated, and she didn’t want to be a burden for Yang Ye!

So, death was the best option for her.

Suddenly, Emperor LI appeared before her, and he slapped his palm down upon her.

It stopped just a few inches away from her head, and then a wave of pressure surged down upon her and instantly extinguished the flames around her.

After that, Emperor Li moved around 10m back.

Ding Shaoyao frowned slightly, and her eyes were filled with bewilderment as she gazed at him.

Emperor Li spoke indifferently, “What a courageous woman.”

He turned around and left.

In the beginning, he’d really planned to use her to threaten Yang Ye or kill her so that Yang Ye would feel the pain of losing the ones he loved.

Emperor Li wanted revenge.

But the instant Ding Shaoyao ignited herself, he changed his mind.

Because at that moment, he suddenly realized that he wasn’t the same person anymore.

While he’d been hiding from Destiny in the past, he hadn’t done anything beneath him. He disdained to do something like that.

Yet now, when facing someone as powerful as Yang Ye, he’d actually thought of using a woman to threaten Yang Ye.

Laughable! No, it was shameful!

Even he felt that it was shameful and beneath him.

He was Emperor Li!

Before these old geezers had shown themselves, he’d been a renowned figure of the Three Dimensional Universe.

Emperor Li walked off into the distance. A short while later, he’d walked out of the mountain range.

Bang!

At the instant he left the mountain range, a powerful aura swept out of him, and everything in a huge area around him vanished.

The Destiny Transcendence Realm!

A breakthrough of the heart!

Emperor Li glanced at himself and laughed with self-ridicule, “After almost a thousand years of bitter cultivation, I failed to advance, but I never expected that saving a woman would help me attain it. As they say, cultivation really is the cultivation of the heart!”

He looked up at the sky, and then he vanished on the spot.

He hadn’t gone to fight Yang Ye and just vanished into the boundless starry sky.

The Destiny Transcendence Realm!

At this moment, he was one of the strongest experts in the world, and he hadn’t just undergone an advancement in strength, his mentality had changed drastically too.

His gaze had moved beyond that little bit of hatred.

A short while later, Emperor Li had vanished into the starry sky.

In the mountain range, Ding Shaoyao glanced at her hands, and then she suddenly chuckled and sat down.

She just looked up into the sky while a brilliant smile that she’d never revealed for so long had appeared once more on her face, “So I care that much about you…”

At the instant when she faced death, she realized how much she cared about him.

Or it should be said that she really cared about him.

But her people had once told her to suppress those feelings.

A short while later, Ding Shaoyao walked off into the distance. Those light footsteps of hers didn’t sound like the great advisor of the Three Dimensional Universe but a young woman who’d gained new life.

At this moment, the apologetic and oppressive feeling in her heart were gone.

In the starry sky.

The battle was still going on here. Yang Ye’s fierce assault had suppressed Monarch Yan. While he hadn’t fully suppressed Monarch Yan, the situation seemed to be in Yang Ye’s favor.

Yang Ye was undoubtedly very terrifying when he started fighting with his life on the line. Most importantly, he had Primordial Violet Energy, so his recovery was something that few in the world could compete with!

This battle was practically Yang Ye’s longest battle, and at this point in it, the outcome had still not been decided.

Sword energy and fiery lightning flickered incessantly through the starry sky.

When compared to the entire boundless starry sky, the sword energy and fiery lightning seemed so tiny, but when they collided, the entire starry sky would tremble.Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Human strength that went beyond the heavens!

Just like that, around an hour passed.

Yang Ye swung his sword, and Monarch Yan was blasted backward!

But such a huge distance seemed so close and clear when it was in outer space.

Yang Ye shot a glance down below. At this moment, countless experts from the Four Dimensional Universe had entered the Three Dimensional Universe, and the flames of war had practically stretched throughout every corner of the Three Dimensional Universe.

There weren’t that many experts from the Four Dimensional Universe, and the chaos in the Three Dimensional Universe had mainly arisen from internal strife!

In the beginning, the order he created was there, and it suppressed them all and stopped them from acting rashly. Yet now, along with the arrival of the experts from the Four Dimensional Universe, these powers had started to madly reveal their cruel sides.

Now, the entire universe was much more chaotic than it had been!

Yang Ye looked up at the sky. A woman was looking down at him from somewhere above the clouds with a smile on her face, “Order? Where’s that order you spoke of?”

Yang Ye looked her in the eyes and remained silent.

She smiled, “See? Your order is nothing but a joke. Besides that, you can see your heart clearly and keep it that way, and that is an advantage of yours. However, not everyone can do the same.”

She flipped her right palm, and two pieces appeared before Yang Ye. A black and a white piece.

The woman chuckled, “In the beginning, people are kind. Those words are partially true, but there’s another half. Actually, good is always accompanied by evil. Being ignorant doesn’t represent absolute goodness, but just the lack of ability to do evil. Even though you’re at the Destiny Transcendence Realm, I know you don’t know much about this realm of cultivation I set. A breakthrough of the heart to attain it actually represents cultivating the heart and reaching a state of mental perfection. But do you know… an evil mentality can do the same!”

Yang Ye frowned slightly, “What are you trying to say?”

Her smile grew even more moving, “There are two sides to everything in this world. Just like you have an emotionless side and one full of emotion. You wish to establish a new order so that everyone can change toward the direction you want. But you fail to realize that you’re just forcefully suppressing the nature of people. Some are born with a kind nature while others may be born evil! Why must the evil accommodate the good?”

Good and evil!

Yang Ye was quite lost.

Just as she’d said, some were good but some were evil. When the good did good, they were following their hearts, and when the evil did evil, they were following their hearts too!

Was that wrong?

Was it?

Her voice came from above the clouds once more, “I once rescued this the Three Dimensional Universe on my own, yet now, I intend to destroy it. Do you think I am good or evil?”

The bewilderment in Yang Ye’s eyes was growing.

Good and evil!

He noticed that his mind was in a little chaos right now.

She glanced at the world below the clouds. In the end, her gaze returned to Yang Ye, “Have you still not realized? Many people in this world were born with demons in their hearts. Just like this very moment when the Four Dimensional Universe is invading. How many experts actually invaded? However, the entire Three Dimensional Universe is in chaos. I took a glance just now, and the number of people who died at the hands of the Four Dimensional Universe don’t even account for a quarter of the people who died from the internal strife within the Three Dimensional Universe!”

She shook her head and smiled, “Yang Ye, the heart is divided into good and evil. Some choose goodness, and some choose evil. There is nothing wrong about that. Once they grow, and they wish to do good, then of course. If they have enough strength, they can do good. Similarly, if the evil have wild ambition and wish to stand above the rest and reign supreme, then so long as they have the necessary strength, they can do it too. My order is where I do not help the good nor the evil. They are allowed to grow as they please! Right, simply speaking. The strong reign supreme, it’s the law of the jungle!”

Monarch Yan glanced at the bewildered expression in Yang Ye’s eyes and remained silent. He didn’t attack either.

What did cultivators fear the most?

It was the collapse of their mental state!

For example, someone always considered something to be correct, but later on, that person realizes that it’s wrong!

Obviously, Yang Ye was in that state right now!

Everything she said stabbed at his heart!

The woman’s voice resounded from above the clouds once more, “There is no absolute evil or absolute good. Throughout these countless years, if there is good, there will be evil. Your order just suppresses evil and favors good, but I’m sure you’ve noticed the outcome of that. Once they have a chance, the evil erupt, and they act even worse than they once did. Moreover, because of your suppression, they are like wolves who have gone hungry for weeks, and they will madly reap what they desire and unleash the evil within them.”

“No!” Suddenly, Yang Ye looked up at her, “You’re mistaken!”

Her eyes narrowed slightly.

Yang Ye looked her in the eyes, “You’re right about something. The world is full of good and evil, and everyone has a demon within them. However, right is right, and wrong is wrong. Good is good, and evil is evil. If there is less evil in this world, the world will be better.”

He chuckled at this point, “As you’ve said, the strong reign supreme. So, when I’m strong, I will build order of my own, and I will suppress evil. That is what I want, and I follow my heart. I’m not mistaken. Of course, if I’m weak, then I cannot help this world anymore. But now, I, Yang Ye, want the world to follow the order I’ve established. If anyone doesn’t like it, that’s alright, they can come fight me. If they kill me, they can decide everything in this world!”

As soon as he finished speaking, his sword shook violently.

The Sword Dao of Order had entered its initial stages!
