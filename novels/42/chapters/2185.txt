Chapter 2186 – Yang Wudi!

Snowy may be na?ve and pure, but she was no fool.

She knew the state Yang Ye was in.

Yang Ye and the others didn’t have the strength to fight the god race too, and she was the only one who could save him.

Only she could force the god race to make a compromise!

She was the most important being in the large universe, and everything the god race did would become meaningless if she died.

Ding Shaoyao gazed at Snowy for a long time, and then she said, “Alright, I’ll do it!”

Snowy lowered her claw and gazed at Yang Ye. While Yang Ye had lost his eyes, his heart wasn’t blind. He stretched out his hand with the desire to grab Snowy, but his hand soundlessly dropped down as soon as he raised it just a little.

An Nanjing wasn’t the only one who was exhausted, he was exhausted too!

At this moment, he didn’t have any strength left in him.

Snowy flew over to Yang Ye’s ear, rubbed his ear lightly with her face, and then flew over to Ding Shaoyao.

Ding Shaoyao took Snowy with her and was about to leave when Yang Ye suddenly said, “Shaoyao.”

Ding Shaoyao stopped and closed her eyes slowly, “I’ll repay you for what I owe you, I definitely will.”

“Don’t harm her!” Meanwhile, Yang Ye said, “If anything happens to her, then I’ll annihilate your god race, including you.”

Ding Shaoyao glanced at Yang Ye, and then she vanished into the distance with Snowy.

The surroundings fell silent.

Only a few were left on Yang Ye’s side.

Among the 11 from the Nether Pavilion, Bling Maiden was gone. Sky Maiden and Blood Maiden were heavily injured.

As for Yu Jing, Qin Chuan, Mad Saber, Ling, and the monkey…

So many were gone.

Suddenly, Yang Ye started walking slowly and walked over to A’Man. At this moment, A’Man was lying in space, and she was so weak that she seemed like she would die at any moment.

Yang Ye placed his right hand on her and his Primordial Violet Energy surged madly into her.

A’Man gazed at Yang Ye while tears soundlessly flowed down from her eyes, “They’re gone, all gone!”

Yang Ye didn’t say a word. Two streams of blood red just seeped out from his eye sockets.

A short while later, Yang Ye stood up slowly. He went 300m to the right, and he saw a corpse floating there. It wasn’t whole anymore, and it was in a terrifying state.

Yu Jing.

It belonged to Yu Jing.

Yang Ye walked over to the corpse, took out a clean white robe, and covered Yu Jing’s corpse. His hands were trembling as he did it.

Yang Ye patted Yu Jing’s shoulders lightly and spoke in a trembling voice, “We’ll be brothers again in our next life.”

He went around Yu Jing to the other side, and a golden rod was floating there. But it was just an afterimage, it was just a shadow of it that remained. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

The monkey!

He was gone!

He didn’t even leave a corpse behind!

Yang Ye spoke softly, “Brother Monkey, you and I met by chance, yet we became friends. It is I who have wronged you. I can only repay you for this in your next life.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he waved his right hand lightly and the golden rod’s image vanished silently.

Yang Ye turned around and went over to Blood Maiden’s group. There was a corpse in front of them.

Blind Maiden!

Their third sister!

The third sister he’d met in Dark Hell Continent, the third sister who didn’t like to speak!

Yang Ye knelt down slowly. At this moment, he cried like a child.

Dead.

She was truly dead!

Sky Maiden shook her head slightly, “Third Sister wanted to go accompany him for a long time!”

She was naturally talking about Blind Maiden’s childhood sweetheart.

Yang Ye shook his head with force, and his body trembled incessantly.

The surroundings were silent.

Two hours later.

Yang Ye brought them all into the Primordial Pagoda, and then number graves appeared in a bamboo forest within the pagoda. They were the graves, Qin Chuan, Blind Maiden, Mad Saber, and the others.

Yang Ye just knelt before those graves without moving.

Zi’er and Tian Xiu were by his side.

Tian Xiu’s face was emotionless, and her hands were clenched tightly.

Zi’er’s eyes were filled with pain. She was in pain because Yang Ye was in pain. She’d never seen Yang Ye act like this. All of them had died for Yang Ye, and she truly couldn’t imagine what Yang Ye was feeling right now.

Just like that, Yang Ye knelt there for three days and nights.

On the fourth day, Yang Ye stood up slowly. As he gazed at the graves, he said, “Third Sister, Brother Monkey, Yu Jing, Qin Chuan… All of your deaths won’t be for nothing!”

He turned around and left.

At the 2nd level of the Primordial Pagoda, on the bed which Zi’er used to be using, An Nanjing was there.

An Nanjing!

The woman who’d almost died in battle for him.

An Nanjing laid there quietly, and Zi’er, Tian Xiu, and Little Sky were by her side.

Little Sky spoke softly, “She’s just in deep sleep. She’ll wake up once the Primordial Violet Energy repairs her internal injuries!”

Little Sky glanced at Tian Xiu who had an icy cold expression on her face and continued, “A’Xiu, it was you who saved her. How did you do it?”

Little Sky was really curious about that. Because even Primordial Violet Energy couldn’t save An Nanjing from the injuries she’d suffered, but Tian Xiu had forcefully pulled her back from the edge of death!

Tian Xiu lowered her head slightly and remained silent.

An Nanjing was fine!

Yang Ye took An Nanjing’s hand. He knew that he really owed her too much!

Too much!

Meanwhile, Tian Xiu grabbed Yang Ye’s arm and spoke softly, “Big Brother, S-Snowy will be alright, right?”

Yang Ye gazed at Tian Xiu, and tears had started to seep out from her eyes. She just gazed at Yang Ye, “I-I could have stopped Snowy from leaving. B-But, I-I couldn’t… I couldn’t… There are stronger people, and both you and Snowy will die if I do anything now. I-I don’t want you to die, I really don’t!”

Yang Ye rubbed her head, “Snowy will be fine. I’ll go get her soon!”

He paused for a moment and continued, “You mentioned stronger people. Who is that?”

Tian Xiu shook her head, “They are very powerful. My clansmen were killed by them. I-I can sense them, and many will die.”

Yang Ye embraced her and spoke softly, “Don’t be afraid, it’ll be fine. Don’t be afraid!”

Tian Xiu hugged him tight. Her gaze was icy cold and without a shred of emotion.

Suddenly, Yang Lianshuang appeared by Yang Ye’s side. He looked at her, and she passed a rock to him, “A senior asked me to give it to you.”

Yang Ye asked, “What is this?”

She gazed at him, “I’ll tell you once you finish viewing it.”

As soon as she finished speaking, she gazed at Tian Xiu, Zi’er, and Little Sky, “Let’s leave for now!”

Zi’er and Little Sky exchanged glances, and then they nodded and left with Tian Xiu.

Only Yang Ye remained on the 2nd floor.

Yang Ye circulated his profound energy, and a strand of it surged into the rock. A moment later, a ray of white light flashed out of it, and then a middle aged man appeared in front of Yang Ye.

The armless man!

It was the armless man, Yang Wudi!

Yang Wudi gazed at Yang Ye, “Kid, when you see this projection of me, it proves that I’m dead. You’re no fool, so you should know who I am.”

He paused for a moment and continued, “All those years ago, I had to leave and become entangled with that person in order to turn your destiny around. That departure went on for years. No matter what my reason was, I’m still not a good father or husband. It’s an undeniable fact. Especially to your mother, I owe her too much, too much indeed. Because even until death, she still didn’t know who I am, and she didn’t know anything about all those things that are plaguing you. Of course, I never planned to tell her. I can just take care of it on my own. Haha!”

Yang Ye remained silent.

Meanwhile, Yang Wudi continued, “When Profounder Continent was destroyed, I couldn’t do anything. All I could do was help you a little and bring you to a new plane. However, I couldn’t help you too much. You have to tread on your own path. You did well and made it all the way. Now, all I can do is heavily injure those old fellows for you, and make them incapable of acting against you. However, it will only stop them for a while. As for the future, you’ll have to face it yourself.”

He suddenly flew over to Yang Ye at this point and rubbed Yang Ye’s head gently, “The happiest moment in my entire life was meeting your mother. She was a simple girl, and she was the love of my life. As for you kid, I like you too. From now on, both your mother and I won’t be by your side, and you’ll have to take care of the rest.”

His figure gradually turned ethereal.

At the instant he vanished, he stared at Yang Ye with a gaze that was unprecedentedly gentle.

Meanwhile, Yang Lianshuang walked in, “The five progenitors didn’t show themselves because he heavily injured them. However, he paid with his life. Moreover, he was the reason why the Buddhist Progenitor and the other progenitors didn’t act against you in the past.”

Yang Ye closed his eyes slowly, “I-Is he really dead?”

Yang Lianshuang nodded, “He was injured before he fought the five progenitors, and he ignited his lifespan during the battle with them. He paid that price to heavily injure them before dying, and that was why those five progenitors didn’t show themselves before you!”

Yang Ye closed his eyes, and a long time passed before he took a deep breath, “Father, I’ll make them pay for everything they owe us, I’ll make them pay a hundredfold!”
