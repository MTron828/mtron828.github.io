Chapter 17 – The Value Of Talismans

When he saw Yang Ye nod, the rugged man roared with laughter. With his perception, he was able to determine with a single glance that Yang Ye was probably a disciple of a sect that had come to temper himself. Moreover, Yang Ye held a sword in his hand, so he was probably a disciple of the Sword Sect. Thus, he was naturally happy to have a disciple of the Sword Sect join them.

The rugged man introduced himself. “Young Brother, I’m Man’zi, and I’m the leader of this group. There are a total of four people including me in our group. Now, with you joining us, it’ll be five people.”

“Yang Ye!” Yang Ye smiled as he nodded. He had a slightly good impression of this frank man that stood before him.

Man’zi led Yang Ye to his group. Man’zi’s group was made up of three men and one woman. Man’zi pointed with his right hand at the only woman and said, “Young Brother, this is my younger sister, Qing Hong. She’s at the ninth rank of the Mortal Realm.”

When he looked along the direction Man’zi pointed and saw the woman, Yang Ye was slightly astounded. The woman was around 20 years ago, and her dressing was extremely revealing. She wore a very short beast skin wrapped around her chest, whereas, her cream colored stomach was revealed beneath her chest. It was even to the extent that her belly button was fully revealed. As for her lower body, she wore a short skin skirt that revealed a pair of slender and long pure white legs.

A black colored dark iron longbow hung on the woman’s right shoulder, and she seemed to be extremely valiant and heroic.

The woman nodded lightly, and then Yang Ye withdrew his gaze. Even though the woman was beautiful, it was enough to just admire her beauty for a moment, and it would be slightly rude to continue staring.

Qing Hong nodded amiably to Yang Ye because Yang Ye hadn’t revealed that sort of gaze towards her like others did, and this caused her to arouse a trace of a good impression of Yang Ye.

Man’zi pointed at a man at the side who was around 25 years old, and he said, “Xiao Hei, he’s at the peak of the ninth rank of the Mortal Realm, and he utilizes a dagger. He’s our group’s main attacker!”

The man called Xiao Hei obviously didn’t like to talk, and he just nodded to Yang Ye. After that, he continued playing with the pitch black dagger in his hand.

Man’zi pointed at the last man and said, “Xiu Yuan, he utilizes a sword as well, and he’s at the peak of the ninth rank of the Mortal Realm. He has the best chance amongst all of us to become a First Heaven Realm expert!”

When he heard this, Yang Ye looked at the last man. The last man was around 23 years old, and he had a slightly handsome appearance. However, he revealed quite undisguised arrogance on his face. Moreover, Yang Ye even sensed that this man’s gaze towards him faintly carries a strand of vigilance.

Yang Ye glanced a Qing Hong and then seemed to be lost in thought. After that, he nodded before withdrawing his gaze because he didn’t want to care about all this nonsense.

“Young Brother, what rank are you at in the Mortal Realm?” Meanwhile, Xiu Yuan looked at Yang Ye and seemed to ask casually.

When they heard him, the others looked at Yang Ye as well because since Yang Ye dared to come to Grand Myriad Mountains at such a young age, his strength would definitely not be weak.

“The seventh rank of the Mortal Realm!” Yang Ye nodded and spoke truthfully.

“The seventh rank of the Mortal Realm?” All of them were stunned when they heard Yang Ye, and even Man’zi’s eyes revealed slight astonishment. According to their expectations, since Yang Ye came to the Grand Myriad Mountains at such a young age and used a sword, he ought to be a disciple of the Sword Sect, and the disciples of the Sword Sect had to be at the ninth rank of the Mortal Realm before they could leave the sect to temper themselves!

“You aren’t a disciple of the Sword Sect?” Xiu Yuan was astounded. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Yang Ye shook his head. At this moment, he really couldn’t be considered as a disciple of the Sword Sect because Labor Disciples weren’t considered within the scope of being disciples!

When he saw Yang Ye shake his head, Xiu Yuan laughed with ridicule while a mocking smile curled up on the corners of his mouth. Moreover, his attitude instantly took a 360 degree turn as he said, “Kid, you’re only at the seventh rank of the Mortal Realm, so you’re courting death by entering the Grand Myriad Mountains. It’s better for you to cultivate for a few years before coming back!”

Man’zi hesitated before he said in a light voice, “Young Brother, the Grand Myriad Mountains are filled with danger, and it’s truly slightly dangerous to enter it with your strength.” He’d originally thought Yang Ye was a disciple of the Sword Sect, yet he’d never expected that he’d made a mistake.

Yang Ye smiled and said, “It’s fine, I’ll just go with all of you through Snake Forest, and I’ll leave after we pass through Snake Forest.”

“That won’t do!” At this moment, Xiu Yuan said in a deep voice, “Every single one of us are ninth rank Mortal Realm experts, and all of us are able to protect ourselves in there. If someone at the seventh rank of the Mortal Realm like you follows us, then you’ll burden our entire group. Go back from where you came!”

“Xiu Yuan!” Qing Hong frowned while she revealed a displeased expression and said, “It’s already really good that he was able to attain the seventh rank of the Mortal Realm at such an age. You weren’t even at the fifth rank of the Mortal Realm when you were around 16 or 17, right? So why speak so offensively?” She was frank by nature and spoke everything on her mind. Moreover, she had a slightly good impression of Yang Ye, so she was slightly unable to continue watching as Xiu Yuan ridiculed Yang Ye like that.

Xiu Yuan’s expression turned slightly unsightly when he saw Qing Hong speak on Yang Ye’s behalf, and he said, “Qing Hong, we’re a group, so why speak on behalf of an outsider? Moreover, his strength is weak, and keeping such a burden would only drag us down.” His words were frank, and he paid no regard to Yang Ye who stood at the side.

Man’zi and Xiao Hei went silent when they heard this. Even though Xiu Yuan’s words were unpleasant, they had the same thoughts in their minds at this moment.

Qing Hong glanced at Xiu Yuan before she looked at Yang Ye that had been keeping silent since the beginning, and then she sighed lightly and said, “Young Brother, it’s dangerous for you to enter the Grand Myriad Mountains with your current strength. Why don’t you go with us and help us clean up the battlefield, and we’ll give you some gold coins after we leave the mountains and sell our gains. However, this will be quite a small amount of gold coins. What do you think?” As far as she was concerned, since Yang Ye had come to the Grand Myriad Mountains to hunt and kill Darkbeasts at such a young age, then he definitely urgently required wealth. Otherwise, it would be impossible for someone to head to the Grand Myriad Mountains while still at the seventh rank of the Mortal Realm.

Yang Ye glanced indifferently at Xiu Yuan before he looked at Qing Hong who spoke on his behalf. As he gazed at this kind woman, Yang Ye had a slight good impression of her, and he immediately nodded with a smile and said, “Alright, I’ll help all of you clean up the battlefield.”

When he saw Yang Ye agree to clean up the battlefield, the disdain on Xiu Yuan’s face grew deeper. He looked down on such a person, yet he didn’t say anything because they did indeed require someone to clean the battlefield, and it wouldn’t be bad to have an assistant.

Man’zi nodded and said, “Since it’s like that, then let’s head in. Brother Yang, you follow behind us, and don’t go too far.” As he spoke, he led the way towards Snake Forest.

On the way, Qing Hong walked by Yang Ye’s side. She turned her head to look at Yang Ye who remained silent, and she said because she thought that Yang Ye was angry, “Little Fellow, don’t be angry. Besides being one that cares about strength and power, Xiu Yuan isn’t a bad person. So, don’t take his words to heart!”

Yang Ye was stunned when he heard this, and then he shook his head and smiled before he said, “I didn’t take his words seriously. However, I have to thank Big Sister Qing Hong.” Yang Ye had a slightly good impression of this woman by his side that had constantly spoken on his behalf. As for Xiu Yuan, he didn’t take such a person seriously at all. Even though Xiu Yuan was at the peak of the ninth rank of the Mortal Realm, he wasn’t afraid of Xiu Yuan at all.

“That’s good.” Qing Hong smiled and said, “Follow behind us later, and you must be careful. The Snake Forest is filled with snakes, and a great deal of them reside on the trees. The slightest carelessness will cause you to suffer a surprise attack.”

“Aren’t all of you hunting Darkbeasts in Snake Forest?” Yang Ye asked curiously.

Qing Hong shook her head and said, “No, Snake Forest is mostly filled with low rank Darkbeasts, and they don’t possess Inner Cores. So, they’re not worth much money at all. Our objective is a place called Nether Wolf Gorge outside the Snake Forest. The Nether Wolves there are at a high rank, and they possess Inner Cores. Moreover, the skin of those Nether Wolves are extremely valuable!”

“Then around how much are all of you able to earn from a trip to the Grand Myriad Mountains?” Yang Ye was slightly interested in the lives of these mercenaries.

“If our luck is good, then around five or six thousand gold coins!” Qing Hong replied. “If our luck isn’t good, then one or two thousand, and it’s even to the extent that someone might perish. Our group originally possessed five members, but he perished when we hunted a Ground Bear in the Grand Myriad Mountains that day.” When she spoke up to here, Qing Hong’s beautiful face dimmed down slightly.

When he saw Qing Hong’s expression dim down, Yang Ye changed the topic and said, “Big Sister Qing Hong, do you know the value of talismans crafted by Talisman Masters?” He was aware in the past that talismans were extremely expensive, yet he didn’t know the rough number.

“Talismans?” Qing Hong was moved when she heard this word. “Amongst ordinary five element talismans, low-grade talismans are worth 10,000 gold coins, mid-grade talismans ae around 30,000 gold coins, whereas, high-grade talismans are basically impossible to be purchased normally. They only exist in some large scale auctions, and as for the price, if the auction house does well in making the bids rise, then over 100,000 or even more would be possible!”

Over 100,000! Yang Ye’s eyelids twitched when he heard this number. Now, he finally understood why Bao’er was so wealthy. That little girl possessed so many talismans, and casually selling a few of them would be sufficient for an ordinary person to feed himself for his entire lifetime!

“We’ve entered the Snake Forest. Follow by my side and don’t get too far away from me!” As soon as they entered Snake Forest, Qing Hong pulled Yang Ye over to her side and spoke with a solemn expression.
