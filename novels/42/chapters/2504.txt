Chapter 2505 – 36 Yin Yang Techniques!

The hotel was very quiet at this moment.

The young man fell silent as he gazed at the head.

Elder Xing had fallen silent too.

Waves of shock were surging through their hearts!

Dead!

A Five World Realm expert was dead, just like that!

A long time passed before Leng Xuan took the head and gazed at Yang Ye, “Sorry for disturbing you.”T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Yang Ye cracked a smile, “Don’t mention it. Thank you for giving me a Divine Treasure and around 50 World Crystals. I’m very grateful.”

Leng Xuan nodded slightly, “Please do accept it!”

Yang Ye smiled, “I won’t be sending you off.”

Leng Xuan walked out of the hotel with the head in hand, and his hands were trembling.

Trembling!

Just like that, Leng Xuan vanished with the head in his hand.

In the hotel.

Yang Ye nodded slightly to Elder Xing and returned to his room.

Elder Xing remained silent behind the counter for a long time, and then he said, “Notify our young miss.”

…

Once he returned to his room, Yang Ye entered the Primordial Pagoda.

There was a blood red brush in front of him. Yang Ye brought it over to Sword Scroll and asked, “What is this brush?”

She sized it up and said, “Who cares what it is? As long as it can be used!”

Yang Ye laughed bitterly, “I can’t use it!”

Sword Scroll was puzzled, “Huh?”

Yang Ye replied, “I’ve tried. It has a consciousness of its own, and it’s very against me. Moreover, it chose to seal itself and isolate itself from the outside world. If I can’t obtain its help, it’s useless to me even if I use it in battle. Unless I destroy its spirit and let it form a new spirit of its own. However, I don’t have the ability to do that. Snowy can, but that little fellow isn’t here right now…”

Yang Ye missed the little fellow even more at this point. Only now did he realize that little fellow wasn’t just a cute face, she could do many things!

Meanwhile, Sword Scroll said, “Leave it aside for now and we’ll see about it when Snowy returns.”

Yang Ye nodded because he had no other choice.

After resting for a while, Yang Ye left his room and went to the underground trade area again. He needed to improve his body the best he could. It could be said that his body was the most important right now.

It couldn’t be helped because it was a method of cultivation that he’d selected!

After going through the stalls here, Yang Ye didn’t find anything useful.

He was quite disappointed.

Yang Ye left the street and returned to the battlefield. At this moment, the demon army had retreated and only left corpses all over the battlefield. Some belonged to demons, others to humans. As for those who survived, they’d received the rewards from their respective races, and coupled with their own spoils, they could be said to have gained tremendously.

On the city walls, Yang Ye shot a glance back at the battlefield. It was still quite mysterious. Because even until now, he’d only seen a single extraordinary genius, Xing Biqing. She was around his age and was at the Five World Realm. Moreover, she was a Five World Realm expert who’d attained her cultivation through hard work alone!

He knew that there were definitely many other monstrous geniuses and old seniors as well!

A long time passed before Yang Ye returned to the House of Indulgence, and he went to the counter.

Elder Xing glanced at Yang Ye and remained silent.

Yang Ye asked, “Where’s your young miss?”

Elder Xing asked, “Do you need something?”

Yang Ye smiled, “I got an inner core from her for free, and I have to return the favor!”

Elder Xing replied, “It’s a small matter.”

Yang Ye shook his head, “I’m temporarily leaving the War Dimension for my sect. Perhaps I won’t return here again. Tell her that if she doesn’t make me return the favor now, I may not have another chance to do it!”

Elder Xing fell silent for a long time and said, “You two discuss it yourselves. I’ll go notify her!”

Yang Ye nodded slightly and sat at the side. It didn’t take long for Emerald to serve him some tea.

Yang Ye drank a mouthful of tea, and it didn’t take long for Xing Biqing to arrive before him.

She glanced at him and asked, “You’re leaving the War Dimension?”

Yang Ye nodded, “I’m a disciple of the Ancient Sword Sect, so I naturally have to return.”

She said, “You can grow better here.”

Yang Ye smiled, “I have to return for certain reasons.”

She thought for a moment and said, “Young Master Ye, I’d like to invite you to a place.”

Yang Ye asked, “Where?”

Xing Biqing replied, “The most dangerous place in the War Dimension.”

Yang Ye frowned, “The most dangerous place?”

She nodded, “At the southernmost part of the War Dimension is an abyss. At the bottom of it are World Crystals, a lot of them. However, it’s very dangerous, and many never return.”

Yang Ye asked, “Only World Crystals?”

She fell silent for a short while and replied, “There are other things too.”

She gazed at Yang Ye and continued, “I need help, and you’re very suitable. If we’re able to survive it, I’ll give you another Lord Realm inner core. Moreover, I noticed you cultivate in the body, so I can get you other natural treasures. Getting to the Four World Realm in the body shouldn’t be a problem.”

The Four World Realm!

Yang Ye glanced at her, shook his head, and chuckled, “You people from these large clans are truly blessed from birth!”

Resources!

Only now did he truly understand how important these resources were. Just like this very moment, if he had sufficient resources, attaining the Four World Realm wouldn’t be difficult at all. While he had Snowy, his resources and reserves were still far, far inferior when compared to the large clans and powers.

Xing Biqing spoke softly, “While people of the large clans are blessed from birth, we are helpless in many aspects. Brother Ye, the competition here is very brutal. It’s a little better because of the desolate race right now, but it still exists. Moreover, it’s the kind of conflict that does not draw any blood. It doesn’t just happen in the outside world, it even happens in our own clans. The slightest mistake may lead to eternal damnation! Because there are countless behind us who are waiting to take our position!”

Yang Ye smiled, “I don’t know anything about clans. It’s great to be alone and free!”

She glanced at Yang Ye and asked, “So you agree?”

Yang Ye nodded, “Since you’ve made such a good offer, I have no reason to refuse. When do we leave?”

She glanced out of the hotel, pondered deeply for a moment, and said, “Brother Ye, this trip will be very dangerous. So you must think through it carefully.”

Yang Ye smiled, “You can’t get anything without some risk!”

She nodded, “I’ll come to you in two days.”

She stood up and was about to leave, but she seemed to have thought of something and said, “You killed a Five World Realm expert of the Leng Clan, so they may take a few different courses of action. Firstly, send a stronger expert to kill you. Secondly, give up for now, and then look for an opportunity to act against you. The first possibility is more direct, and the second is more insidious. But no matter what, you should be careful. If you really can’t deal with it, just don’t leave this hotel. So long as you remain in here, they won’t dare to come attack you. However, if you leave, then my Xing Clan cannot interfere. So, please do remember that!”

She turned around and left.

…

Yang Ye finished his tea and returned to his room.

Yang Ye went to the pool of lightning. At this moment, the demons were using it to temper themselves. If it was purely a competition of physical strength, then he was absolutely not a match for them. Not to mention him, even some Five World Realm demons wouldn’t be a match for them.

They had the best natural treasures, absorbed one of the best types of spirit energy, and had Darkvoid Divine Lightning to temper themselves. Their bodies were at a terrifying level right now!

Actually, they were mainly training so diligently because of Erya. She had told them that she would spar with them upon her return!

So, if they were too weak, Erya would definitely beat them up!

If they trained now, they would suffer less when the time came!

Yang Ye looked up at the lightning. In the pool of lightning was around 100 bolts of lightning. According to his estimations, even if he tossed them all out, even a Five World Realm expert would be obliterated in an instant!

Even he couldn’t endure the entire pool. Not to mention him, even Erya would probably find it difficult to resist!

The core of the pool felt terrifying to him!

Unfortunately, the pool of lightning only obeyed Snowy!

Only Snowy could use them. It couldn’t be helped because only Snowy could help them improve.

Yang Ye glanced at the lightning, shook his head, and left.

Cultivate!

In the next two days, Yang Ye started to cultivate. Besides cultivating, he would spend some time with Su Qingshi and the others. Especially Xue’er, Bao’er, and Little Yao. He really didn’t have much time, especially time to spend with his family. Luckily, they never complained about it.

On this day, Yang Ye went to Bai Zhixian’s palace. She was cultivating, and she stood up when she sensed Yang Ye’s arrival. Yang Ye walked over to her and smiled, “The Limitbreaker Realm?”

She had attained the Limitbreaker Realm!

She nodded, “I’ll be at the Two World Realm soon!”

Yang Ye smiled, “Take it slow!”

She nodded and hesitated to speak.

Yang Ye asked, “Your father?”

She shook her head.

Yang Ye spoke softly, “Don’t worry, so long as I have Snowy, Eternal Kingdom won’t dare to harm your father. If they do that, I’ll make them pay with blood. If they dare to force my hand, then I’ll dare to go wild!”

She embraced him and spoke softly, “I know.”

Yang Ye nodded and just hugged her.

A long time passed before she asked, “Want to cultivate?”

Her voice was soft like the buzz of a mosquito.

Yang Ye was stunned for a moment, but it didn’t take long for him to understand what she meant.

Meanwhile, his lower body felt cold.

The 36 Yin Yang Techniques! What was the best thing in the world? The melody of a flute being blown.
