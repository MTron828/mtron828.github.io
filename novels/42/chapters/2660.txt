Chapter 2661 – Fight!

As soon as he said that, a sword howl resounded abruptly!

The Divine Abode’s master’s expression changed rapidly!

A sword slashed down from above him!

Heaven Executor!

It was a sword he’d experienced the strength of.

He didn’t dare to go head-on against it and flashed backward to avoid Yang Ye’s attack. However, at the instant he dodged away, a pitch black pike suddenly appeared where he’d been standing.

He’d used overwhelming speed to get his attack to hit first even when he was the second to attack!

The pike shot toward Yang Ye’s stomach, and it was as swift as a bolt of lightning!

Yang Ye pulled his sword back slightly and swung it at the pike.

Bam!

The pike was instantly blasted away!

The Divine Abode’s master waved his right hand, and the pike returned to his grasp. After that, he raised his left hand and dropped it.

Bang! Bang!

Terrifying rays of aura swept toward Yang Ye.

He hadn’t arrived before Yang Ye, but his aura had!

Yang Ye grinned, and then a sword hall soundlessly appeared above him. An instant later, boundless slaughter intent and sword intent surged from him into the sword hall.

Boom!

A wave of powerful sword energy rippled out from above Yang Ye. In an instant, countless strands of sword energy rained down through the sky like a storm!

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!

The sky above the entire End Dimension resounded with horrifying sounds of tearing!

As for the auras of the experts in the surroundings, they were forcefully stopped by Yang Ye’s sword energy.

Swoosh!

Meanwhile, a pike suddenly pierced through Yang Ye’s sword energy, and the Divine Abode’s master was behind it!

Yang Ye remained visibly calm as he tapped his right foot down, and then he strode forward and stabbed.

A head-on collision!

The sword and pike collided.

Bam!

As soon as they came into contact, the Divine Abode’s master’s pike instantly exploded apart!

Boom!

The Divine Abode’s master hurriedly shot backward. Yang Ye was about to follow up with another attack when a figure suddenly appeared before him, and then this figure slammed a punch at him!

Yang Ye instantly felt monstrous fist intent surge toward him!

Yang Ye didn’t dare act carelessly against it. He raised his sword above his head with both hands, and then slammed it down.

Hiss!

This swing slashed open the space before him, and a sharp and ear-piercing sound pierced the eardrums of everyone here!

Meanwhile, the fist arrived.

Bang!

A figure was blasted away!

It was Yang Ye!

Around 1km away, Yang Ye glanced at his sword. It was fine, but he felt that his body was numb!

His entire body was numb!

Yang Ye looked over, and he saw a bearded man standing not too far away from him. The man was robust, and he wasn’t very handsome.

Yang Ye gazed at the bearded man’s hands. The man’s fists were very powerful!

Some of the others wanted to join the battle, but the bearded man suddenly said, “I alone am enough!”

The Divine Abode’s master frowned slightly, “Dafeng, it isn’t the time to act alone. He’s linked to our fate, so we cannot allow the slightest mistake. You…”

The bearded man known as Dafeng glanced at him, “If I’m no match for him, all of you can join in, alright?”

The Divine Abode’s master wanted to say more, but Dafeng said, “While he deserves death, he’s only at the Destiny Realm. No matter what you think, I feel it’s shameful for so many peak Destiny Realm experts to join forces against him like this. You can join in if I’m no match for him.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he charged at Yang Ye!

Boom!

The world shook before him.

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly, and a fist shot at him like a bolt of lightning!

It wouldn’t be that bad if it was really a bolt of lightning. However, the strength of this punch had fully surpassed the strength of lightning. It was truly capable of obliterating the world!

Even though the man wasn’t as strong as Heng Wangu or Zuo Mu, he was absolutely not weak!

Yang Ye didn’t dare to act carelessly. He took a step forward, and then boundless slaughter intent and sword intent rippled out of him.

The fist arrived, and Yang Ye’s sword shot forward!

Bang!

Yang Ye’s entire body and sword shook. However, he wasn’t blasted away by the punch, and he’d forcefully stopped the terrifying energy within it!

Suddenly, Dafeng relaxed his fist and grabbed Yang Ye’s sword.

He wanted to take Yang Ye’s sword!

As soon as Dafeng grabbed the sword, Yang Ye felt like his sword was about to escape his grasp. Meanwhile, Yang Ye released the sword and slammed himself forward, and his figure slammed directly against Dafeng!

Bam!

Both of them shot backward simultaneously. However, at the instant he was pushed back, Yang Ye grabbed his sword and spun it, catching Dafeng off guard and forcing Dafeng to release it.

At this moment, there was almost 300m between them!

Dafeng glanced at his hand, and there was a sword injury on his palm!

His eyes narrowed slightly as he clenched his right fist, and then he appeared before Yang Ye and slammed a punch at Yang Ye!

This punch caused the space around Yang Ye to form a strange vortex!

Meanwhile, a sheathe appeared in Yang Ye’s left grasp, and then he sheathed his sword.

A moment of silence ensued, and then Yang Ye drew the sword and swung it!

But that wasn’t the end of it, he immediately followed up with another swing!

Just like that, Yang Ye swung countless times in an instant. Even he hadn’t counted the exact number!

Explosive force!

The explosive force created by the Domain Sword and Heavenrend made his attack unprecedentedly powerful!

Boom!

A huge expanse of space with Yang Ye at its center collapsed and was obliterated, and a figure was blasted away at the same time. It was Dafeng’s figure!

Meanwhile, the others in the surroundings had been pushed back by the excessively powerful force of their collision. However, they had locked down the surrounding space as they feared that Yang Ye would flee. So, it was absolutely impossible for Yang Ye to flee with ease.

Even though the space here had been obliterated by their collision, it only took a while for space to recover completely.

At this moment, Yang Ye finally understood why they had dared to pursue him beyond the scope of the End World.

The End Dimension wasn’t the same as it had been. At this moment, the End Dimension was covered by something that could conceal them from the workings of the heavens!

Obviously, they’d prepared a plan to deal with him!

Dafeng glanced at his arm. At this moment, there were many cracks on it!

He was a peak Destiny Realm expert. So, logically speaking, Yang Ye could never suppress him no matter how monstrous of a genius Yang Ye was!

That sword!

Dafeng gazed at Yang Ye’s sword!

Yang Ye’s sword had increased Yang Ye’s strength tremendously. It could be said that with Heaven Executor’s help, Yang Ye had the strength of a peak Destiny Realm expert! Moreover, the sword was so terrifying that nothing in this world could suppress it!

Even a Super Divine Treasure would be easily destroyed by it!

It was Destiny’s sword!

Many hadn’t been able to recognize it in the past because it had lost its tip, but now that its tip had been restored, they naturally recognized it!

Meanwhile, the Divine Abode’s master suddenly said, “Dafeng, do you still plan to continue?”

Dafeng glanced at him, and then gazed at Yang Ye, “Do you dare to take a punch of mine with a normal sword?”

A normal sword?

Yang Ye grinned, “Do you dare to make the others leave?”

Dafeng’s eyes narrowed slightly, and Yang Ye continued, “Actually, your fists are so strong because these fellows are here. Their presence puts you in an invincible position. Even if you’re no match for me, you have nothing to fear because they will lend you a hand, right?”

Dafeng gazed coldly at Yang Ye but remained silent!

Yang Ye smiled, “If you really want a one on one battle, then tell them to leave, and we can fight to the death. Alright?”

Fight to the death!

Dafeng laughed coldly, “Yang Ye, it seems you’re dreaming. Make them leave so you can flee? Haha, what a good plan. Unfortunately, it’s only a dream!”

He glanced at the others and said, “Join forces with me!”

The Divine Abode’s master glanced indifferently at Dafeng. Actually, he’d already realized that besides those truly old geezers in the Destiny Realm, ordinary Destiny Realm experts were incapable of suppressing Yang Ye.VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Yang Ye had Heaven Executor in his grasp, so his strength transcended the limits of his cultivation!

Once he said that, the others didn’t hesitate to release their auras and suppress Yang Ye.

A one-on-one battle?

They would naturally not fight Yang Ye in single combat now. Honor wasn’t important now, what was important was defeating Yang Ye and obtaining the Sprite Progenitor.

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings and grinned, and then he raised his sword and charged at the Divine Abode’s master.

The others attacked him in unison!

The joint forces of around ten extraordinary experts was truly horrifying!

It could be said that even destroying the End Dimension would be easy for them!

Bang!

At the instant Yang Ye charged forward, he was blasted far away again!

Their joint forces was something he couldn’t resist at all!

Perhaps he could try fighting them in single combat, but he was no match for their joint forces!

Yang Ye was severely injured from this collision.

Blood seeped out incessantly from the corner of Yang Ye’s mouth.

Fight?

He was really no match for around 10 peak Destiny Realm experts!

Yang Ye laughed bitterly. He’d overdid things a little this time. Since there was no way to escape, he planned to fight!

Yang Ye charged at them again.

Boom!

However, he was blasted away once more.

Suddenly, a hand supported Yang Ye’s flying figure.

In the wooden house within the Primordial Pagoda, the woman in black suddenly looked up, and killing intent flickered in her eyes.
