Chapter 2749 – Omni Phantom!

It didn’t take long for an ethereal figure to condense into form!

It was like a shadow!

A shadow!

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly. The existence before him actually still refused to show their main body. Was it because it was impossible, or was fear of something keeping it from doing so?

A moment of silence ensued, and then the mysterious expert suddenly said, “I underestimated you a little. I didn’t expect you to go head-on against that sword. Right, that Heavenshield of yours is outstanding indeed. As expected of something that once belonged to Yang Busi.”

Yang Ye didn’t say anything in response and just shot a glance into the Primordial Pagoda instead.

At this moment, Erya had suppressed Burial!

Yang Ye heaved a sigh of relief from the sight of this. Actually, he’d been betting, betting that Snowy and Erya could suppress that sword. Even though it was quite a risky move, he didn’t have a better idea!

Burial was truly too terrifying in the hands of the mysterious expert. Only by separating them would his side have a chance at victory!

Luckily, he’d won the bet.

Burial was just a sword once it wasn’t being controlled by the mysterious expert, and so it couldn’t do much! Especially when it was facing Erya and Snowy!

Bam!

Suddenly, an explosion pulled Yang Ye back from his thoughts, and he looked over to its source. Yan Wu and the others had pushed Sky Saber back. Besides that, Zuo Mu had been completely suppressed by Liu Yuan, Huang Buer, and a few others!

The strongest among them, Heng Wangu, was being kept busy by Jian Wudi, so he couldn’t do anything at all!

The remaining Destiny Realm experts of the End World were being completely suppressed!

Based on the current situation, their side had won.

Of course, Yang Ye didn’t think so.

Even if Heng Wangu and the others were killed, it wouldn’t be considered a victory while this mysterious expert still remained alive.

This mysterious expert of unknown origin was the truly terrifying one among them!

Suddenly, the mysterious expert formed a strange seal with both hands.

In an instant, Yang Ye’s body shook violently!

In the Primordial Pagoda, an ear-piercing howl resounded from Burial, and then it started slashing madly, causing the entire sky to be sliced open!

Erya and Snowy were slightly stunned by this, and then Erya slammed herself against the sword!

Bang!

Burial was instantly blasted away. However, the aura it emanated grew increasingly stronger and terrifying!

Snowy gazed calmly at Burial and no one knew what she was thinking.

Outside the Primordial Pagoda, Yang Ye suddenly said, “Stop him!”

As soon as he said that, he charged at the mysterious expert, and An Nanjing immediately charged forward as well!

Meanwhile, the mysterious expert suddenly stretched out his hand and waved it gently in their direction.

Bang!

The space in front of Yang Ye and An Nanjing suddenly started burning, and then a wave of powerful energy erupted from it. The energy was so powerful that it didn’t seem like something humanly possible!

Yang Ye suddenly howled with fury and swung his sword.

Explosive Heavenrend combined with Explosive Madness Sword Technique!

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!

Yang Ye slashed his way forward, and the energy before him was forcibly slashed apart. A short while later, he arrived before the mysterious expert. Meanwhile, the mysterious expert suddenly clenched his right hand and slammed a punch forward!

Bang!

At the instant it shot forward, a dark golden dragon surged out from his fist, and it slammed against Yang Ye’s sword.

Bam!

Yang Ye was blasted away. Meanwhile, the dark golden dragon’s tail swept at An Nanjing. The powerful physical strength it possessed forced An Nanjing to a stop.

A moment later, it swung its tail at her again, causing space to turn pitch black in its wake!

An Nanjing’s expression changed slightly. She clenched both her fists, crossed them, and slammed her figure forward.

Bang!

The powerful force of the collision instantly blasted her away!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly appeared before the dragon’s tail, and he grabbed his sword in both hands before stabbing it in the tail.

Swish!

Sparks sprayed from the collision, and a mark appeared on its tail!

Yang Ye hadn’t been able to penetrate its defenses at all, and he was instantly blasted away instead!

Once he stopped himself, An Nanjing was about to charge forward once more, but he stopped her!

Yang Ye looked up, and he saw a huge dragon soaring above the mysterious expert!

A dark golden dragon. It wasn’t formed from energy, and it was a real dragon instead!

“The Hellion Dragon!” Suddenly, Erya’s voice resounded in Yang Ye’s mind, “It’s a beast from Destiny’s era, and its physical defenses are only inferior to the Black Tortoise and me. You must be careful, Big Brother Yang!”

The Hellion Dragon!

From the era of Destiny!

Yang Ye looked up at the huge dragon. At this moment, it was looking at him too, and there was indifference in its eyes, like a supreme god looking down upon humanity!

Yang Ye sensed contempt!

Suddenly, the black sword within the Primordial Pagoda started to struggle even more violently.

Yang Ye gazed at An Nanjing, “Go inside!”

She shook her head.

Yang Ye cracked a smile, “Go on. They need you more than I do. Moreover, our chances of suppressing that sword will increase with you there. Then we can get Snowy to destroy it!”

An Nanjing glanced at Yang Ye, and then she entered the pagoda without saying a word!

She wasn’t an indecisive person, and especially not at a time like this!

In the Primordial Pagoda, the sword was suppressed once more after An Nanjing arrived.

However, the mysterious expert outside the pagoda suddenly stopped, “Fine, I’ll kill you first then!”

As soon as he said that, the huge dragon above him suddenly dived down at Yang Ye!

The powerful aura that was emanated as a result of its physical strength was simply suffocating!

He’d only sensed this kind of pressure from Erya!

Yang Ye didn’t dare to act carelessly and closed his eyes slowly!

The huge dragon grew closer and closer to him!

It revealed undisguised contempt for him!

Besides those existences from the era of Destiny, who else did it ever have to take seriously?

It didn’t take long for it to get close to Yang Ye.

Suddenly, Yang Ye opened his eyes, and his eyes were blood red! Yang Ye stomped his right foot down and transformed into a ray of light that shot up into the air!

Yang Ye held the Sword Precursor tightly with bond hands. At this moment, his blood was actually surging madly toward the Sword Precursor!

He was feeding it his blood!

A moment later, Yang Ye’s sword stabbed against the dragon’s body. This tiny sword was truly too insignificant when compared to the size of the dragon!

However, when it stabbed against the dragon’s scales, its huge body trembled violently, and then Yang Ye twisted his sword with both hands!

Hiss!

Dragon blood sprayed all over Yang Ye as his figure transformed into a ray of light that shot through the dragon’s body!

At this moment, the dragon was furious. Its eyes opened wide as it slapped a claw at the ray of light that Yang Ye had transformed into. But Yang Ye didn’t go head-on against the claw, and he just kept flashing around the dragon’s body!

Every single flash caused a strand of blood to spray from the dragon!

Suddenly, the mysterious expert vanished. A moment later, a ray of sword energy exploded apart in midair, and then a figure was blasted away.

The mysterious expert was about to attack again, but the sound of something being torn apart resounded from nearby. The mysterious expert looked toward its source, and he saw Sky Saber being pushed back repeatedly before the joint forces of a few experts!

It wasn’t just Sky Saber, everyone else from the End World was being completely suppressed!

The mysterious expert crossed his hands, and a flame flickered on his right arm. It seemed like something was struggling free.

After hesitating for a moment, the mysterious expert suppressed the flame and flashed forward. In an instant, countless afterimages flashed through the surroundings.

Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!

Muffled explosions resounded throughout the battlefield, and then figures were blasted away in succession!

All of them were the experts of Paradise City!

Even Jian Wudi had been forcibly blasted over 1km away!𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

The battlefield was instantly divided!

Yang Ye and the others retreated to the side, and they gazed at the mysterious expert with an extremely solemn look on their faces!

Every single time the mysterious expert revealed a little more of his strength, the more fearsome he would be. No one knew how strong the mysterious expert really was!

At this moment, Heng Wangu and the others had gathered by the mysterious expert’s side.

The End World had less than 10 Destiny Realm experts left!

It had suffered severe losses!

As for Yang Ye’s side, they had only lost four experts! Moreover, three of them still had their souls!

It could be described as a complete victory!

Of course, Yang Ye wasn’t in a very good state. He was covered in injuries. It could be said that Yang Ye and An Nanjing had suffered the most serious injuries! But if they didn’t keep the mysterious expert at bay, their side may be utterly crushed!

The joint forces of An Nanjing, Erya, and him had barely been able to keep the mysterious expert at bay!

The mysterious expert suddenly said, “I didn’t expect all of you to force us into such a corner!”

He suddenly unfurled his right fist, and a flame flashed out from his palm. As soon as the flame appeared here, the surroundings instantly became hot. At the same time, space actually started to melt at a visible rate!

The space in a huge area had instantly started to melt!

Everyone here was shocked by this and moved backward. Even Yang Ye sensed extreme danger at this moment!

What flame is that?!

The mysterious expert gazed at the flame and grinned, “Unfortunately, I’m afraid not many in this world are aware of what you are.”

As he spoke, he gazed at Yang Ye’s group, “This flame is called Omni Phantom. It’s the first flame of the Three Dimensional Universe, and it was once suppressed by Destiny. Why don’t you experience its strength for yourself?”

As soon as he finished speaking, the flame in his palm suddenly started floating over toward Yang Ye’s group!

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly as he indicated that the others should step back. He took a step forward and was about to take action when a hand suddenly descended onto his shoulder. An instant later, a slightly familiar voice resounded in his ears, “Allow me!”

Yang Ye was stunned speechless.

Meanwhile, the mysterious expert suddenly said, “Long time no see!”
