Chapter 811 – The Way To Recover!

“You’re courting death!” Fan Li roared furiously and flicked with her finger, causing a powerful strand of wind to shoot towards the center of Yang Ye’s forehead.

Yang Ye’s pupils constricted. If it was in the past, then he would be fine even if he just stood there and let it hit him. Yet now, it was sufficient to kill him in an instant. While he didn’t have his strength anymore, he had his discerning ability, and her attack was covered in flaws under the detection of his Enlightened Sword Heart. However, the sad thing was that he couldn’t dodge it at all!

At this moment, his movement couldn’t keep up with his mind at all. Moreover, it was pointless even if it could because the gap between their current strengths was truly too huge!

Of course, Yang Ye wasn’t entirely incapable of protecting himself. After all, he still had 2 strands of sword intent from the Sword Sect’s Founding Ancestor. That sword intent had instantly blasted a Half-Saint flying that day. The woman before her was only at the Exalt Realm, so she couldn’t resist the might of that sword intent at all!

He’d hoped to keep them so he could absorb them and strengthen his own sword intent in the future. Yet now, he was even about to lose his life, so he naturally wouldn’t continue trying to save it!

Right when Yang Ye was about to activate it, a ray of white light suddenly struck Fan Li’s attack, and it immediately dispersed.

Fan Li’s brows knit together slightly, and then she looked at the woman in a green dress.

Li Qingyi smiled and said, “Fan Li, this servant of yours is very interesting. I’d like to have a chat with him!”

Fan Li glanced at Yang Ye, and there was a trace of hostility in her eyes. However, she didn’t dare refuse Li Qingyi.

Yang Ye heaved a sigh of relief. After all, he only had 2 strands of sword intent from the Unfettered One, so it was best if he could save them. Of course, he didn’t let his guard down because he’d said something brainless in that moment of desperation, and he didn’t know what she was thinking!

She sized him up and said, “I noticed something just now. Besides you, everyone else had their heads lowered, and you were even constantly looking at us. Moreover, your eyes are very calm when you face us, and there isn’t a trace of nervousness in them. Even when Fan Li attacked you, you were still very calm. Young man, you’re really not ordinary!”

Yang Ye’s heart shook. So she has been paying attention to me since the beginning....

The smiled and said, “See, just like this very moment. You’re still so calm.” As she spoke, she gazed at Fan Li and said, “Fan Li, do you know about his background?”

Fan Li glanced at Yang Ye and said, “I picked him up on the streets, and I gave him a job cos he seemed pitiable. Just as you said, perhaps he had some background in the past, but it doesn’t matter. No matter how dazzling he was in the past, he’s only a cripple now. I presume you’ve noticed that his meridians have broken apart, and the severity of it is something that even a Monarch Realm expert can’t mend!”

She gazed at Yang Ye when she spoke up to this point, “I don’t like to owe others. I took your sword sheath, so I gave you a chance to live. However, you must remember that a person should get his attitude right. Perhaps you were once a formidable figure, but you’re only a horse keeper now. If you can’t realize that, then you might die on the streets some day!”

Yang Ye glanced at her and didn’t speak a word.

Meanwhile, Li Qingyi suddenly smiled, “You don’t seem like someone who exercises forbearance. What? Aren’t you going to say something? Like the times change? Don’t bully a young man when he’s weak? Or you can look down on me now, but I’ll be too high above you in the future....”

The corners of Yang Ye’s mouth twitched, This woman....

Yang Ye shook his head and said, “She’s very right. Isn’t she?” Actually he knew that even if Fan Li didn’t say a thing. He wasn’t the old Yang Ye who could slaughter Half-Saints like they were dogs. He was only at the Mortal Realm now, and he was one who didn’t have the ability to fight at all.

Just as Fan Li said, if he didn’t get his attitude straight now, then he would really die before he even realized it!

Fan Li glanced at Yang Ye with a trace of surprise.

Li Qingyi gradually restrained her smile, and she gazed at Yang Ye for a short while before she said, “You said you liked me. Is that true?”

Yang Ye remained silent.

Li Qingyi suddenly cracked a smile and said, “I’m not one to judge a person by his appearance. But to be honest, you really are a little too ugly. Besides that, you’re too weak as well. To be realistic, you aren’t qualified to like me. Young man, use your brain when you speak in the future or even death wouldn’t be the worst outcome!”

“Then what sort of strength would be needed to be qualified to like you?” Yang Ye was suddenly a little interested.

Li Qingyi gazed at Yang Ye, shook her head, and chuckled. After that, she got on the horse and transformed into a ray of light that vanished into the sky.

I got disregarded.... Yang Ye shook his head and smiled bitterly.

Fan Li suddenly said, “Do you know who she is?” UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Yang Ye shook his head in response.

Fan Li turned to look at Yang Ye, “There’s a city situated tens of thousands of kilometers away, and it’s called Stellar Sky City. The City Governor’s Estate there is the only Silver Rank organization in an area of hundreds of thousands of kilometers. She is the next governor of that estate. Yet you said you liked her? I don’t know if you were telling the truth or if it was some sort of extreme method to protect yourself. In short, no matter what, you have to understand your current identity and status. Otherwise, even death might not be the worst outcome!”

Yang Ye smiled and didn’t speak a word.

Fan Li suddenly said, “That sword sheath really was extraordinary. So, you’re definitely not an ordinary person. Tell me what your true identity is!”

Yang Ye shook his head and said, “I’ve lost my memories. I can’t remember many things!”

Fan Li gazed at Yang Ye for a short while, and then she said, “Remember that you’re only a horse keeper. Since you’re a horse keeper, then you should act like one. I’ll kick you out of the Fan Clan if you do that again!”

As soon as she finished speaking, she flashed onto a horse and vanished into the sky.

You took my sword sheath yet speak like you’re upright and your actions were justified.... Yang Ye shook his head as he watched her leave, and then he turned around and returned to his room.

Yang Ye sat cross-legged on his bed and opened his open, there was a top-grade energy stone there. It was something he’d secretly kept when he fed the horses earlier. Yang Ye didn’t hesitate to swallow it.

He couldn’t absorb spirit energy from the outside world because his meridians were shattered and clogged, so it was utterly impossible for him to absorb spirit energy from the outside world. The only other method was to absorb it internally!

As soon as it entered his body, bits of spirit energy appeared within his body. Yang Ye was pleasantly surprised to notice that after the spirit energy was transformed into profound energy within him, it was actually violet colored. Even though it wasn’t true Primordial Violet Energy, it wasn’t ordinary profound energy. That made Yang Ye feel overjoyed!

Because the regenerative capabilities of the violet energy caused the meridians within him to slowly heal. Even though it was very slow, it allowed him to see hope.

However, it didn’t take long for a bitter expression to appear on his face because the energy within that top-grade energy stone was exhausted.

After it was converted into violet profound energy, only a very little amount remained. It was so little that it didn’t really have much effect!

I need even more energy stones. It’s best for them to be extreme-grade energy stones or other treasures that contain energy!

But he faced a problem. The Primordial Pagoda was closed to him, so where would he get such energy stones?

Do I have no choice but to steal more horse food? That won’t work, and it’s utterly useless!

Suddenly, the door to his room was opened. Yang Ye had just opened his eyes when a sword was against his neck.

It was the Fan Clan’s second young miss, Fan Meng!

“Ugly fellow, help me steal a horse!” Fan Meng spoke coldly.

Yang Ye secretly prepared the Unfettered One’s sword intent before he said, “Second Young Miss, if you want a horse, then can’t you just head to the stables and get one? Why ask me to steal one for you?”

“Hmph! Manager Ma refuses to give one to me, and he says that it’s because of my older sister’s orders!” Fan Meng spoke angrily, “You take care of the horses, so they wouldn’t be vigilant against you if you go take a horse. I’m telling you right now, I... I’ll kill you if you dare to refuse me!”

Yang Ye laughed bitterly and said, “Second Young Miss, there are so many horse keepers here. Why ask me?”

“Because you’re the bravest.” Fan Meng continued, “All the others fear my older sister, so they would definitely not dare to help me steal a horse. I was watching earlier and noticed that you don’t seem to fear my older sister, so I came looking for you!”

When she spoke up to this point, she moved her sword forward against Yang Ye’s throat and said, “I... I’m telling you not to hesitate or I won’t be able to catch up to them!”

Yang Ye’s face darkened. He said, “Your older sister will kill me if she knows that I stole a horse for you!”

Fan Meng spoke angrily, “You’re a man yet you’re actually afraid of death? Are you even a man!?”

What the fuck!

Yang Ye’s face twitched. Her logic is truly beyond me!

Yang Ye pondered deeply for an instant and said, “Will I benefit from helping you?”

“You want benefits?” Fan Meng was slightly stunned, “The benefit is that I won’t kill you!”

Yang Ye was speechless.

Yang Ye said, “Give me 10, no give me 100 top-grade energy stones, and I’ll help you. Alright?”

He realized that she was determined to get the horse. Since he couldn’t refuse, then he had no choice but to get something from her.

Yang Ye had just finished speaking when a spatial ring appeared in front of him. Fan Meng said, “You’re really a loser. You actually only asked for 100. There are 1,000 here, and they’re all yours now. Go on and quickly steal a horse for me!”

1,000 top-grade energy stones! Yang Ye took a deep breath. If he absorbed the energy within all of them, then he could advance to the King Realm at the very least! So long as that happened, then he could leave the Fan Clan. As for the ancient sheath, it wouldn’t be too late to get it later!

Yang Ye stopped hesitating before such temptation, and he went to help her steal a horse. Because he was one of the horse keepers, so he was able to accomplish it with absolute ease.

Fan Meng was delighted when she saw the pegasus, and she hurriedly got onto it. She was just about to leave when she seemed to have thought of something, and she turned around to gaze at Yang Ye. She said, “You’ll definitely go report this once I leave, and I’ll definitely be taken back if that happens. That won’t do! You must come with me!”

As she spoke, she didn’t even allow Yang Ye to refuse. She immediately grabbed Yang Ye, tossed him behind herself, urged the horse forward, and vanished into the sky!
