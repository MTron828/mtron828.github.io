Chapter 280 – Repaying Kindness With Evil!

“I have other matters to attend to, so I’ll be taking my leave!” After he noticed that the little fellow was about to awaken, Yang Ye didn’t want to stay here any longer and intended to leave. Presently, he just wanted to find a quiet place and wait for the little fellow to awaken.

The women were stunned. However, right when they were about to say something, the other six disciples of the Heavenly Sword Sect who stood behind them had flashed over to surround Yang Ye who was about to leave.

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed when he saw them surround him. He glanced at the six of them before he spoke with ridicule. “What? This is how your Heavenly Sword Sect treats someone that saved your lives?”

“What are all of you doing!?” Meanwhile, Liu Weiwei walked over to Yang Ye’s side, and then she glared angrily at these fellow disciples of hers. Obviously, their actions had infuriated her.

“Senior Sister Liu, don’t interfere in this matter!” A slightly fat man amongst the six of them spoke in a low voice. “We disciples of the Heavenly Sword Sect suffered such a humiliation today. If he were to spread the news of it, then our Heavenly Sword Sect would become the laughingstock of the entire Profounder Continent. At that time, all of us would have committed a crime against the sect!”

“Exactly. If the members of the other territories knew that we’d actually relied on a First Heaven Realm profounder of the southern territory to plead on our behalf and save our lives, then we wouldn’t just bring shame to the Heavenly Sword Sect, we would have brought shame to the entire northern territory as well! So, he can’t be allowed to live!”

“He’s just a profounder at the First Heaven Realm, and he’s even from a lousy place like the southern territory.... I was already annoyed by him since the beginning, so he deserves death!”

Since they were able to come to the southern territory, it was already sufficient to prove the potential and strength they possessed, and it was exactly because of this that they would feel humiliated when they had to rely on Yang Ye to plead on their behalf in order to survive. In their eyes, a profounder at the First Heaven Realm was no different than an ant, but they’d relied on an ‘ant’ to survive just now. How could they who boasted about being extraordinary geniuses of the southern territory endure something like this?

So, at the moment that Luo Xue had left, they’d very tacitly chosen to act against Yang Ye!

As he gazed at those disciples from the Heavenly Sword Sect who didn’t conceal their killing intent at all, Yang Ye grinned, and then he gazed at Liu Weiwei who was about to speak and said, “Look, at most times, one must never try to be a good person! Right, besides that, I have to say that all of you disciples of the Heavenly Sword Sect are really trash. First, that senior brother of yours abandoned all of you and left; now, these ungrateful fellows intend to act against the person who saved their lives. Alas, if I knew this would happen, then I should have allowed them to become food for those Darkbeasts. What do you think?”

“You regret it now?” The slightly fat young man sneered and said, “I don’t know why you’re able to negotiate with that mysterious Shapeshifted Darkbeast, but it isn’t important anymore. The important thing is that you must die here today. Don’t say that I didn’t give you a chance. You can choose any one of the six of us. So long as you’re able to survive three moves and kowtow 10 times to every single one of the six of us, then I’ll spare your life. Alright?”

“HAHA!!” The other disciples instantly roared with laughter when they heard him, and they laughed in an extremely arrogant and complacent manner.

“Huang Yan, do you really intend to act in this way?” Liu Weiwei gazed at the slightly fat young man while her gaze had turned slightly cold.

The slightly fat young man called Huang Yan seemed to be slightly fearful of Liu Weiwei, and he immediately restrained the arrogant expression on his face before he said, “Senior Sister Liu, all of us really respect you, and we don’t want to go against your intentions. However, this is related to the reputation of our Heavenly Sword Sect and the northern territory. So, I hope that Senior Sister Liu doesn’t interfere in this matter. The six of us will naturally apologize and seek out punishment from Senior Sister Liu once we’re done here!”

Liu Weiwei sighed, and then she said, “Huang Yan, you’re not an idiot. Could it be that you haven’t noticed?”

“Noticed what?” Huang Yan frowned.

Liu Weiwei shook his head, and then she glanced at Huang Yan with slight disappointment before she said, “Since the army of Darkbeasts surrounded us until the moment that the six of you surrounded him, his expression has remained extremely calm from the beginning until the end. He hasn’t revealed even a trace of nervousness or fear. Is this normal? Moreover, why would that mysterious Shapeshifted Darkbeast from before give him face? He’s just a profounder at the First Heaven Realm, so why would he dare to travel to the central region of the Grand Myriad Mountains by himself? Have you thought about all of this?”

Liu Weiwei had said all of this in front of Yang Ye, and she hadn’t concealed it from him at all. So, Yang Ye’s gaze towards her had changed upon hearing all of this. Because he realized that he’d slightly underestimated this woman.

Huang Yan and the other five disciples fell silent. They weren’t idiots. They’d overlooked all of this because of those Darkbeasts just now, but now that Liu Weiwei had mentioned it, they’d thought about it for a moment and noticed that it really was unusual!

A First Heaven Realm profounder dared to head deep into the central region of the Grand Myriad Mountains and remain without the slightest shred of nervousness or fear while facing all of them who were King Realm experts. Was this because he was brave? Or perhaps because he had some sort of shocking trump card?

After a short while, a wisp of a savage expression flashed through Huang Yan’s eyes, and he said, “No matter what trump card he possesses, he’s only at the First Heaven Realm, and he doesn’t even have the ability to fight back in front of us. If we don’t eliminate him now, then we would be finished if he exposes what happened here today! Attack!”

“Let me see who dares to do that!” Right at this moment, Liu Weiwei flipped her palm, and her sword appeared in her hand before she pointed it at those disciples of the Heavenly Sword Sect.

“Senior Sister Liu, you intend to make a move against us for a piece of trash from the southern territory who has no relationship with you?” Huang Yan had a slightly unsightly expression as he spoke in a low voice.

Liu Weiwei paid no attention to Huang Yan, and she said to Yang Ye instead, “Leave, quickly! I’ll stop them!”

Can you stop them? Yang Ye sighed as he glanced at her. In the past, he didn’t believe that a purely kind person existed in the world because he’d never encountered such a person. No matter if it was Elder Mu, his master Lin Shan, Su Qingshi, or Qin Xiyue, all of them had only come into contact with him because of his natural talent or other benefits! So, he didn’t believe that a purely kindhearted person existed in the world!

However, after he encountered this woman, his thoughts were shaken. Needless to say, even though he didn’t need the woman’s help or protection, it caused Yang Ye to have a strange feeling. It wasn’t a feeling of like or love, and he just felt that this woman could become his friend!

A person would definitely encounter all sorts of people throughout one’s lifetime. Many of these people would become one’s friends, but even more would just become passerby. Yet now, he had a feeling that he didn’t to be a passerby in her life, or it could be said that he didn’t want her to be a passerby in his life.

Yes, every single person should have a friend that didn’t mind one’s appearance, status, or wealth!

Yang Ye took a deep breath before he shook his head and chuckled. He disregarded those disciples of the Heavenly Sword Sect before he gazed at Liu Weiwei and said, “Allow me to introduce myself. Yang Ye from Southpeace City!”

When he spoke these words, he suddenly felt his entire body become light. After that, his eyes gradually opened wide before his eyes were filled with shock and pleasant surprise!

Yang Ye had always advanced courageously when it came to the Sword Dao, and he’d never hesitated or given up.

When it came to love, he’d hesitated and even felt a feeling of inferiority. However, he’d changed later on. So, he dared to loudly proclaim his love to Su Qingshi, and he dared to loudly promise that he would come to the Sword Sect to get her in the future!

That change had allowed his mental state to improve, and it had allowed his Sword Intent to advance into the 4th level! It was also at that time which Yang Ye had understood a principle. That principle was that regardless of whether it was love, friendship, or the Sword Dao, one should advance courageously and never hesitate or give up!

To put it in simpler terms, if one felt affection, then one should speak of it and act on it! To put it in even simpler terms, one should face the thoughts in one’s heart without holding back at all! When facing an enemy, since the enemy caused one pain, then one should cause even more pain to the enemy. When facing someone that one liked, then affection was affection. There was no need to conceal it or fake it, and it should be proclaimed loudly!

Just like this very moment, he wanted to become friends with her, so he didn’t hesitate to speak! Of course, this wasn’t the main point. The main point was that he’d understood something of utmost importance at that instant just now, and it was that he should face the intentions in his heart! Because he understood this, he noticed that he’d attained the 5th level of Sword Intent after he spoke those words!

Yes, he’d attained the 5th level of the Sword Intent now!

The Sword Intent was an unreal and ethereal thing. There was no method or technique to improve it, and there was only a single way to improve it — the improvement of one’s mental state. Only the improvement or transformation of one’s mental state would allow Sword Intent to improve along with it. However, the improvement of the mental state was even more difficult to attain than Sword Intent....

Those disciples of the Heavenly Sword Sect were stunned. Has this fellow gone mad? He’s actually introducing himself now? But why does his name sound so familiar?

Liu Weiwei was stunned as well. She hadn’t expected that Yang Ye would actually introduce himself to her at this moment. What does he intend to do? Could it be that he isn’t aware of the situation he’s in right now? At this moment, Liu Weiwei had the impulse to bash Yang Ye up. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“Hey, have you gone mad from fear?” Meanwhile, Cai Yanyan suddenly patted Yang Ye on the shoulder and said, “It’s already at a time like this, yet you aren’t fleeing quickly but have introduced yourself instead? Yang Ye? Yang....”

When she spoke up to here, she suddenly gazed at Yang Ye with disbelief, and then the corners of her mouth twitched slightly as she said, “You... you are that Yang Ye from the southern territory who’s said to be the Quasi Sword Emperor that has comprehended 4th level Sword Intent and attained the Enlightened Sword Heart?”

When they heard her, those other disciples were instantly stunned, and then their gazes towards Yang Ye were filled with shock and bewilderment!

Yang Ye was actually quite famous. Because he possessed 4th level Sword Intent and the Enlightened Sword Heart. Especially the Enlightened Sword Heart because no to mention the entire southern territory, it was extraordinarily rare even throughout the entire Profounder Continent. In any case, even if it was in the history of the Heavenly Sword Sect, only a single person had attained the Enlightened Sword Heart before the age of 20! That person was the Heavenly Sword Sect’s Founding Ancestor! Moreover, after the Founding Ancestor of the Heavenly Sword Sect, not a single disciple from the Heavenly Sword Sect had attained the Enlightened Sword Heart before the age of 20!

Yet now, one had appeared before them!

After feeling shocked, besides Liu Weiwei and Cai Yanyan, the other six disciples exchanged glances, and all of them noticed ghastly killing intent in each other’s eyes!
