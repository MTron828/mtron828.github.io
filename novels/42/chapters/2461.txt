Chapter 2462 – Erya Enters the City!

Executor entered the Sword Gourd, and Yang Ye held his dual swords as he charged at the old man.

The eyes of the Five World Realm expert before Yang Ye gradually turned icy cold.

Actually, the Di Clan didn’t want to offend Yang Ye at a time like this. After all, Yang Ye was no ordinary person, and he was a madman. But it didn’t represent that they feared him. Yang Ye was provoking him and refusing to give them any face, so if the Di Clan still chose to endure it, they would undoubtedly be laughed at by the entire world.

Large clans cared about their honor the most!

Yang Ye had arrived before the old man, and a sword swept at the old man’s throat.

It was like a bolt of lightning!

The old man’s eyes narrowed slightly as he moved 30m back to avoid Yang Ye’s attack. A moment later, he pressed his palm down at Yang Ye from afar.

Bang!

The space above Yang Ye slammed down like a mountain and crashed down upon Yang Ye.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye swung his swords forward.

Hiss! Hiss!

That expanse of space was instantly sliced open.

Suddenly, the old man vanished on the spot, and then a huge fist appeared out of thin air and slammed at Yang Ye’s head.

It hadn’t even arrived before him when a wave of powerful energy had blasted cracks open in the space behind Yang Ye.

While the old man was at the Four World Realm now, his attack possessed the strength capable of destroying five worlds! It was extremely strong!

Yang Ye didn’t dodge, nor could he. The force of the punch covered the surroundings, so not to mention him, even the space around him was enveloped within it.

Yang Ye suddenly spun on the spot and slashed his swords.

The Sword Domain!

Five swings!

Unlike before, it was executed with two swords, so it was two swords each executing five swings with the Sword Domain!

His swords descended.

Bang!

The old man’s energy was instantly blasted into bits! At the same time, he was pushed over 1km away! And the old man hadn’t even stopped himself when a flying sword flashed.

The old man’s eyes narrowed slightly. He stretched out his right hand and twisted it, causing a vortex to form in space and stop the sword!

In just an instant!

The sword pierced through the vortex and went straight in!

The old man frowned and punched at it.

The energy of five worlds!

Boom!

The flying sword was punched away, but the old man was pushed over 300m back again. The old man wasn’t even able to counterattack when Yang Ye appeared before him.

Both swords descended in unison!

The Madness Sword Technique!

Just like that, the old man was pushed back repeatedly!

At the moment the old man started to be pushed back, he knew the situation was bad. Sure enough, Yang Ye’s swords descended like a storm, and every one of them was lethal! This forced him to exhaust all his strength dealing with them and stopping him from being able to counterattack. Even if he tried to, he noticed that Yang Ye’s strength wasn’t any weaker to him!

Suppression!

Yang Ye was fully suppressing the old man!Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

However, it was just the beginning. As the battle continued, the blood vessels beneath Yang Ye’s skin started to tremble, and his madness intent grew more and more stronger.

Madness!

It didn’t take long for Yang Ye to go completely mad.

At this moment, the old man had been pushed extremely far back! As for the space here, it was covered in pitch black cracks. All of them had been sliced open by Yang Ye’s swords!

Even the old man was covered in injuries!

It was terrible!

At this moment, the old man was beyond shocked because Yang Ye was growing stronger as the battle went on. He was much stronger than he’d previously been. If he was said to be able to deal with Yang Ye earlier, then now, he could only passively defend himself! He didn’t even have the slightest chance to counterattack!

Just like that, the old man was pushed back repeatedly, and it didn’t take long for him to be unable to persist much longer. It was because his arms and body were covered in injuries, and some even pierced through his entire body. It could be said that his body was almost in pieces.

If this continued, death would only be a matter of time!

“Attack!” Suddenly, the old man’s voice resounded.

As soon as he gave the order, five powerful auras shot out from the city, and then they slammed down upon Yang Ye.

Boom!

Yang Ye was blasted over 3km away!

Meanwhile, five extraordinary experts appeared before the old man. All of them were peak Four World Realm experts! Moreover, their auras weren’t inferior to the old man who’d suppressed his own strength to the Four World Realm!

Every extraordinary clan had its own territory, and the Di Clan was no exception!

They were one of the Di Clan’s trump cards!

The old man stared at Yang Ye who was in an insane state right now!

Horror!

He felt quite horrified by Yang Ye. He was a Five World Realm expert. While he’d suppressed his cultivation, he was still a Five World Realm expert at his core! However, Yang Ye had almost killed him just now! Yang Ye was actually that strong!

At this moment, he’d gained a clear realization that Four World Realm experts were no threat to Yang Ye! Not to mention Four World Realm experts, even Five World Realm experts with their cultivations suppressed were no match for him!

It could be said that he was practically invincible below the Five World Realm!

Suddenly, Yang Ye transformed into a ray of light and vanished on the spot!

The old man’s expression changed drastically, “Yang Ye, you…”

The old man hadn’t even finished speaking when an expert in the distance was sliced into bits by Yang Ye’s dual swords! Once he instantly killed that expert, Yang Ye charged at another. The Sword Gourd by his waist trembled, and then a ray of light flashed out of it. The flying sword was even faster than Yang Ye and struck a nearby Four World Realm expert.

That Four World Realm expert’s expression had changed drastically when he saw the sword shoot at him. He stomped his right foot down and moved 300m back. However, Yang Ye was even faster than him. As soon as he stopped, Yang Ye appeared before him.

Two swords descended!

200 swings in a breath of time!

All of them struck the same spot!

While that expert had fought back in the face of death, it was pointless. He was instantly sliced into pieces.

Meanwhile, Erya appeared beside Yang Ye. She glanced at him and silently moved to the side before quietly devouring the expert’s soul and energy. Yang Ye wasn’t in a normal state right now, so she couldn’t afford to offend him.

Yang Ye ignored Erya who was sneaking a ‘meal’ over there. He gazed to the side once he killed that expert and vanished on the spot.

Two rays of sword energy flashed in parallel to each other!

That expert’s eyes narrowed slightly. He didn’t flee because he knew that it was impossible.

He risked his life instead!

That Four World Realm expert clenched his fists slowly, and then he put them together and slammed them forward.

Bang!

A wave of flames rippled out from his fists. In an instant, an ocean of flames appeared in the space before him!

However, this ocean of flames was sliced open by two rays of sword energy, and then they arrived above his head!

A vicious glow flashed through his eyes, and then his stomach started to expand. An instant later, he exploded apart.

Bang!

A wave of powerful energy exploded forth, and the space in a huge area shook and cracked open!

As for Yang Ye, who bore the brunt of it, he was blasted over 10km away!

Self-detonation!

The self-detonation of a peak Four World Realm expert. How terrifying was that? Even Yang Ye was blasted by it to the point his body cracked open! Fortunately, he had Primordial Violet Energy, or he would have been heavily injured even if he could avoid death. Because he’d been too, too close to that expert!

As for Erya, she was completely fine. She was merely pushed a few steps back before she stabilized herself and continued eating!

The Five World Realm experts of the Di Clan had extremely unsightly expressions on their faces!

3 peak Four World Realm experts had died just like that!

Their hearts were bleeding!

However, Yang Ye didn’t stop. Once his injuries had healed slightly, he charged at the old man.

The old man’s face was extremely ferocious. He glanced at Erya who was still devouring the souls and energy, and he said, “You go capture that young girl. I’ll keep him busy!”

As soon as he said that, his figure transformed into a beam of light that charged at Yang Ye.

Meanwhile, the other Four World Realm expert charged at Erya!

Obviously, they planned to capture Erya to threaten Yang Ye!

Erya suddenly looked up at the Four World Realm expert who’d charged at her, “What are you trying to do?”

That expert spoke ferociously, “What do you think?”

As soon as he finished speaking…

Bang!

He was blasted away and slammed against the city walls, causing the thick and strong city walls to collapse!

The Four World Realm expert crawled up from the rubble and spat out a few mouthfuls of blood. After that, he looked down at his stomach, and it had a hole in it!

A hole that pierced straight through!

He was beyond shocked, and he looked up at the young girl before him, “W-Who are you?!”

Erya patted her palms together and walked over to him, “I’m Erya, Snowy’s friend. Understand? It’s fine if you don’t understand. And, I’m going to eat you now!”

Erya slapped her palm against the man’s head.

Bang!

That expert was slammed into a pile of mush!

Erya squatted down and started devouring. Around 15 minutes later, she patted her stomach and shook her head, “I’m still a little hungry!”

She glanced at the old man to the right. Actually, she wanted to devour the old man, but she didn’t dare to go over there! Yang Ye wasn’t in a normal state right now, and she was worried that he would attack her too!

Erya hesitated for a moment. Suddenly, she looked toward the city and cracked a smile, “So many people!”

She walked over to the city’s entrance. It was closed!

Erya kicked the gates.

Bang!

Not just the gate but the entire section of the walls collapsed!

Just like that, Erya swaggered off into Emperor City!

Erya had entered the city!
