Chapter 2458 – I Don’t Fucking Care!

A single swing of the sword!

An instant kill without the slightest chance to escape!

It could be said that if Yang Ye combined his strength with the Seal of Suppression, then he could kill ordinary Four World Realm experts with ease!

Even if he didn’t use the Seal of Suppression, he could still kill Four World Realm experts. However, it wouldn’t be that easy and quick as it was when using the Seal of Suppression!

Yang Ye walked toward the palace with his sword in hand.

An old man appeared before him.

It was one of the few remaining Four World Realm experts in the Longevity Sect.

The old man spoke solemnly, “Yang Ye, must you insist on killing us all? I…”

Hiss!

A ray of light flashed.

At the instant Yang Ye swung his sword, the old man’s expression had changed drastically. He’d been prepared, so a pitch black shield immediately appeared above him.

However, the sword sliced through the shield and descended.

Hiss!

The old man’s figure stiffened, and then it split apart while blood sprayed toward the surroundings.

Yang Ye looked up at the palace and swung his sword again.

Hiss!

A ray of sword energy sliced the palace into two!

In the palace, dozens of people started fleeing in all directions.

Yang Ye shot a glance at them, and then the Sword Gourd trembled before a ray of sword energy flashed.

Hiss!

In the clouds over 500km away, a middle aged man suddenly stopped there, and then he turned around and slammed his palm forward.

Crack!

It instantly cracked open the space around him, but it couldn’t stop the sword in front of him.

Hiss!

The sword stabbed through his hand, and then through his forehead. After that, it made an arc and returned from where it came.

A ray of light shot into the Sword Gourd by Yang Ye’s waist.

Yang Ye shot a glance at the palace, and then he shot up into the sky. A moment later, countless rays of sword energy rained down from above.

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!

In an instant, the palace was transformed into ruins.

The Longevity Sect was no more.

Far away in the sky, shrill cries resounded incessantly, and accompanying them were heads that descended from the sky!

A slaughter!

Anyone at the Limitbreaker Realm was annihilated by Yang Ye! As for those below it, Yang Ye didn’t hunt them down. Killing them didn’t make a difference!

Far away in the sky, every single time Yang Ye killed someone, a young girl would devour their soul and energy.

It was naturally Erya!

Erya had become cold after they left Eternal Village. Especially when she gazed at humans, the killing intent she revealed even made Yang Ye’s heart palpitate slightly! However, her gaze was normal when she looked at him, An Nanjing, and the others.

Around 10 minutes later, Erya walked over to Yang Ye’s side and spoke softly, “Big Brother Yang, I’m full!”

Yang Ye rubbed her head, “Don’t think too much about it. I will avenge everyone in the village.”

Erya lowered her head slightly, “Big Brother Yang, I really don’t understand it!”

Yang Ye asked, “What don’t you understand?”

Erya gazed at him, “They are hunting you because they want Snowy, but Snowy is clearly yours. No, Snowy wants to stay with you, so why do they try to take Snowy?”

Yang Ye replied, “Because Snowy is amazing and can help them do many things.”

Erya asked, “Just because of that?”

Yang Ye nodded.

Erya said, “Then if I’m hungry, can I kill them and eat them too?”

Yang Ye rubbed Erya’s head, “Erya, you’re not like them. Look, you can eat Oxxy and the others, but you won’t eat them, right?”

Erya nodded.

Yang Ye said, “That’s right. You must differentiate two things in this world, who is your friend and who is your enemy. You cannot eat your friends, but you can eat your enemies.”

There were some principles that were difficult for him to explain to Erya. Since that was the case, it was easier to just simplify it!

Enemies and friends!

Erya nodded, and there was a new standard in her heart. She glanced at the surroundings and asked, “When are we going to kill those people who slaughtered the village?”

Yang Ye smiled, “Soon!”

Erya naturally trusted Yang Ye. So, she didn’t say anything and just entered the Primordial Pagoda.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings and vanished on the spot.

In the Primordial Pagoda, Snowy pranced off into Erya’s hall, and then she went over to Erya and passed a tanghulu to Erya.

Erya spoke softly, “Snowy, Grandpa is gone, Butcher is gone, Auntie Vege is gone, and that slovenly old man is gone too. Even Rainy and Eggsy are gone. All of them are dead.”

Snowy blinked and gently rubbed Erya’s head.

Erya licked the tanghulu, “I’ll kill all of them! I swear!”

…

Yang Ye arrived at the foot of a mountain, and around 10 grand buildings stood in the air above.

Yang Ye looked up, and there were three words on the mountain wall ‘纵横道’.

Freedom Sect!

Yang Ye moved his gaze away. Meanwhile, a middle aged man appeared before him.

The middle aged man spoke solemnly, “Yang Ye, we can talk about this. My Freedom Sect is very serious about this, and we…”

Suddenly, a black seal appeared above him!

The Seal of Suppression!

The middle aged man’s expression changed drastically, and then he shot backward. Meanwhile, a ray of sword energy had arrived before him!

Right at this critical moment, a black finger tapped against the sword energy.

Bang!

The sword energy was blasted away!

It flew in an arc and returned to Yang Ye’s Sword Gourd.

At this moment, an old man was standing before the middle aged man.FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

A peak Four World Realm expert!

The old man stared at Yang Ye, “Negotiations are done on the basis that both sides are equally matched. He won’t negotiate with us if we don’t reveal some strength.”

A black robed figure appeared behind the old man.

Another peak Four World Realm expert!

At the same time, a huge barrier of light appeared not too far behind Yang Ye, and it just happened to be facing him!

A formation!

The old man walked closer to Yang Ye and said, “That thing behind you is the Freedom Formation powered by my entire Freedom Sect. It was left behind by our founding ancestor, and it's strong enough to kill a Four World Realm expert with ease! If my senior brother, my young martial nephew, and I are included, we have 3 Four World Realm experts. Yang Ye, my Freedom Sect did hunt you in the past, but that was the past. We’re willing to apologize for the past!”

“Apologize?” Yang Ye smiled, “Do you think that will change anything?”

The old man spoke solemnly, “Yang Ye, trying to take us down with you won’t benefit any of us.”

“Take you down with me?” Yang Ye laughed coldly, “Are you even worthy of that?”

The Sword Gourd no Yang Ye’s waist trembled, and then a ray of light stabbed against the barrier of light behind Yang Ye.

Bang!

The barrier of light shook violently, and then many cracks instantly appeared on it!

However, a wave of powerful energy suddenly rippled out from the barrier of light, and Yang Ye’s sword was blasted back to him.

The sword returned to the Sword Gourd while Yang Ye was pushed back repeatedly for over 30m!

The old man spoke ferociously, “Since you insist, then bring it!”

The old man transformed into a black beam of light that shot at Yang Ye. As soon as he appeared before Yang Ye, a seal suddenly appeared above him!

The old man was instantly suppressed to the Three World Realm!

The old man was horrified and about to retreat, but it was too late.

A sword descended from above!

Hiss!

Space was sliced open like paper before the sword!

Bang!

The old man was blasted away, and as his figure flew, his body started to collapse, inch by inch!

Only his soul remained!

The old man was about to flee with just his soul, but a ray of sword energy suddenly flashed through his forehead!

The old man’s eyes opened wide while bewilderment filled them.

I lost just like that?

Yang Ye ignored the old man because at the instant he killed the old man, the barrier of light behind him had suddenly unleashed a wave of powerful energy at him.

It was extremely powerful!

Yang Ye didn’t dare act carelessly and stabbed with his sword.

Bang!

Yang Ye was blasted away and slammed against the mountain wall.

However, a sword soundlessly stabbed against the barrier of light!

A flying sword!

And this flying sword was his Super Divine Treasure!

Executor!

As soon as it stabbed the barrier of light, it exploded into countless fragments that rained down into the surroundings!

Meanwhile, the other two experts had fled!

Yang Ye wiped off the blood on the corner of his mouth, and he spoke softly, “I can’t be careless!”

Careless!

He'd been careless earlier!

These sects had existed for countless years, so they weren’t that simple.

Yang Ye stopped looking down on them and shot up to the top of the mountain. Yang Ye’s face was indifferent as he looked down at the sect below him, and then a sword suddenly appeared in his grasp!

A wave of sword aura slammed down from above!

Yang Ye raised his sword above his head with both hands!

Right when Yang Ye was about to swing it down, a white shadow suddenly floated up from below. It didn’t take long for an old man with white eyebrows to appear before Yang Ye.

A strand of soul!

The old man glanced at Yang Ye, “I’m the ancestor of the Freedom Sect, I…”

“I don’t know who you are!” Yang Ye’s sword descended.

Hiss!

A ray of sword energy shot through the old man’s body and obliterated him.

The sword energy didn’t stop and shot into the mountain below.

Hiss!

The entire mountain was slashed into two!
