Chapter 2598

The old man’s face was absolutely unsightly when he saw Qi Bitian appear once more.

What was it like to bully someone!

He could be considered to have experienced it for himself!

This young girl before him was simply unwilling to spare anyone!

The old man glanced at her and said, “From today onward, the Sky Palace won’t exist here anymore. As for their people, there was only one of them here, and that person has died at your hands.”

Qi Bitian nodded slightly and vanished on the spot.

This time, she’d really left!

The old man seemed to visibly relax slightly. He glanced at the surroundings, and a huge expanse of the bridge was gone. Moreover, the Boundless Water below it was starting to surge.

If they couldn’t be put under control, the Boundless Water would cause a huge tsunami!

They’d suffered terrible losses!

This time, this world had truly suffered a terrible loss!

The Desolate Emperor shot a glance in the direction Qi Bitian had vanished toward and grinned, “I didn’t expect such an existence to exist in this world! How interesting!

He vanished on the spot.

…

A long time later, Yang Ye opened his eyes slowly.

It was a peerlessly beautiful face that entered his vision!

Su Qingshi!

She grinned, “You’re awake!”

Yang Ye cracked a smile, took her hand, and spoke softly, “It’s great to be alive!”

It’s great to be alive!

It was what Yang Ye felt right now!

Only now did he realize that there were many, many nice things and people in the world. The world wasn’t just full of slaughter and battle!

Cherishing!

A person who’d never experienced death would never be able to truly appreciate the goodness in this world.

Su Qingshi touched his face gently, “All that matters is that you’re alive!”

Yang Ye held her hand tightly in silence.

Everything within reach should be cherished well!

One day later.

Yang Ye left the room and went to the bamboo house. He saw the young girl there.

Qi Bitian!

Yang Ye cracked a smile, “Want to play a game?”

She nodded and waved her right hand, a Go board appeared before her.

They started.

Yang Ye placed down a piece and said, “Thank you!”

Qi Bitian replied indifferently, “For what?”

Yang Ye smiled, “Thank you for saving me.”

She glanced at him and said, “I did save you, but so what? You escaped death this time, but what about in the future? No one can save you forever!”

Yang Ye nodded, “I understand!”

She shook her head, “You don’t understand.”

She placed a piece down and continued, “This world is crueler than you can ever imagine. At many times, there are many things that will still come looking for you, even if you restrain yourself and don’t offend anyone! Not to mention anything else, let’s just talk about the Destiny Realm. Do you know that many people consider it a realm of cultivation, but it actually isn’t!”

Yang Ye replied, “Please tell me more.”

She grinned, “It’s like two kingdoms in the mortal world. One of them is a strong ancient empire while the other isn’t that strong. However, that weak kingdom is gradually growing stronger. So, what do you think will happen?”

Yang Ye replied solemnly, “The strong empire will suppress the weaker kingdom or annihilate it!”

Qi Bitian nodded, “In this world, many people require reasons to do most things, but they still do things for no reason. As you grow stronger and stronger to the point of posing a threat to some existences, they will kill you in advance. Erya had been very, very strong in the past, much stronger than I am right now. She’s not the only one, there’s another existence whom I have a deep impression of, that existence was very strong too. Unfortunately, that existence dead in the end.”

She gazed at Yang Ye continued, “The people of the ancient times were much, much stronger than the current cultivators. Unfortunately, none of their stories ended with a happy ending.”

Yang Ye spoke solemnly, “Why doesn’t it just annihilate everyone and instead waits for people to grow strong?”

Qi Bitian smiled, “Do you think it didn’t try? Of course, it failed, and it didn’t fail due to a lack of strength, it failed because…”

She shook her head and smiled, “Why am I even telling you all of this.” F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

She continued, “I have to leave now.”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Why?”

She shrugged, “I fought earlier, so now I must look for a place to hide.”

Yang Ye spoke solemnly, “Can’t you do that here?”

She shook her head, “All of you will suffer if I remain here.”

Yang Ye fell silent.

Qi Bitian smiled, “You did very well in that world, but it’s far from enough. I’m not being harsh on you. It’s really not enough.”

She put down a piece as she spoke, “You’ve lost!”

Yang Ye was stunned.

Because he hadn’t let her win this time.

She said, “I know you’ve been letting me win. Unfortunately, I’m growing, but you aren’t.”

She stood up and walked over to Yang Ye. She patted him lightly on the head, “The pursuit of knowledge is never-ending. There won’t be anyone here to push you from now on, so self-discipline is absolutely necessary. I hope you don’t disappoint me when we meet again.”

Qi Bitian’s figure gradually turned ethereal.

Meanwhile, Lei Lin ran over from afar, “Big Sis!”

Qi Bitian glanced at her, “Farewell, little fellow!”

Qi Bitian vanished completely.

Yang Ye’s face was frozen as he sat before the Go board. At this moment, his heart felt quite empty.

She was gone!

She’d left just like that!

She’d left without the slightest hesitation!

Lei Lin was still a crybaby as always, so she immediately pounced into Yang Ye’s arms and cried her heart out when she saw Qi Bitian leave.

…

After Qi Bitian left, all the sealed treasures within the pagoda were automatically unsealed.

Qi Bitian walked up into the boundless reaches of space, and there was a young girl there. She was around the same age as Qi Bitian.

It was Tian Xiu!

Qi Bitian glanced at Tian Xiu, “It’s extraordinary that a clone of yours is able to be at such a level.”

Tian Xiu gazed at Qi Bitian, sized her up, and said, “Your strength reminds me of a sword cultivator.”

Qi Bitian smiled, “I’ve met him.”

Tian Xiu nodded slightly, “What do you think of him?”

Qi Bitian walked over to Tian Xiu and smiled, “A very strong sword cultivator, one who shouldn’t exist in this era. Unfortunately…”

Tian Xiu asked, “Unfortunately what?”

Qi Bitian grinned, “People have emotions, but he has abandoned almost all of them. His strength is at an extreme, but compared to him, I prefer that kid, Yang Ye. Even though Yang Ye’s attainments in the sword aren’t as formidable as his, he’s what a person should be. His sword carries emotions and humanity. If Yang Ye becomes like him one day, I think you’ll be disappointed too, right?”

Tian Xiu chuckled, “Indeed. But I’m confident that he won’t.”

Qi Bitian nodded slightly, “I have to leave. Otherwise, this world will collapse!”

At this moment, the space here was very unstable, and it seemed to be filled by some sort of energy!

Tian Xiu glanced at her, “Are you alright?”

At this moment, the ‘命’ character on Qi Bitian’s forehead had lit up, and it was blood red.

Qi Bitian smiled, “It’s alright. It’s not at its prime right now. Even if it senses me and wants to kill me, it would only have a 50% chance of success.”

Tian Xiu fell silent for a few breaths of time and said, “Take care!”

Qi Bitian grinned and shot a glance into the depths of space, “Stop searching! I’m coming!”

It didn’t take long for her to vanish.

Tian Xiu shot a glance toward the area down below, “Take care of yourself!”

She gradually turned ethereal.

Down below.

In the Primordial Pagoda, Yang Ye sat silently before the Go board for a very, very long time. Suddenly, he seemed to have thought of something and grinned as he stood up.

Meanwhile, Executor, the Sword Gourd, the Sword Supreme, the Sword Precursor, the Ancient Bell, and all the other divine treasures went to him.

Yang Ye stretched out his hand and grasped Executor.

A sword howl resounded abruptly!

It was the same but it didn’t feel the same!

In the past, it was a Super Divine Treasure in his grasp, yet now, it was just a sword!

That was what he felt right now!

It was just a sword!

Executor seemed to have sensed the changes in him and started trembling violently. Sword intent gradually appeared around Yang Ye without his command, and then all of the sword intent surged into Executor.

The sword intent had come out themselves, or it should be said, Executor has summoned his sword intent!

Just like that, Yang Ye watched as endless sword intent surged into Executor. Finally, as if it had arrived at its limits, Executor shook madly while sword howls resounded incessantly.

Suddenly, Executor transformed into a ray of light that shot into Yang Ye’s forehead.

Yang Ye’s figure stiffened on the spot.

A moment later, Yang Ye’s pupils constricted while extreme pain appeared on his face. Meanwhile, a ray of sword energy shot down along his forehead, and it didn’t take long for the sword energy to arrive before his chest, or to be more precise, it arrived before his heart!

The sword energy stopped there for a moment, and then it stabbed into his heart!

In an instant, Yang Ye fell to the ground!

Far away in Eternal Kingdom, a limbless man suddenly looked up from a point beneath the ground. He looked toward a certain direction and fell silent for a long time before suddenly laughing, “Executor… A sword born of the heart that stabs the heart to seek the Dao. Can you endure it?”
