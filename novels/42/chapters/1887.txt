Chapter 1888 – Secrets of the Upper Universe?

Feng Yu!

After so many years, Yang Ye heard that name again. His mother’s death was something he’d never be able to forget!

Suddenly, Luo Wuchen asked, “Are you alright?”

Yang Ye took a deep breath and calmed himself. A short while passed before he shook his head, “I’m fine!”

Luo Wuchen glanced at Yang Ye and said, “Let’s go!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he vanished on the spot.

Yang Ye glanced at the bamboo forest. It should be just a coincidence, right?

It didn’t take long for Yang Ye to follow Luo Wuchen deep into the bamboo forest and arrive before the bamboo house. There was a pool before the house, and there was a pergola above the pool. There were around ten people in the pergola, and there were men and women amongst them.

Yang Ye noticed three familiar faces there.

It was the woman in a red dress from Moment Mountain, Hao Tian, and the Ying Clan’s Ying Jing!

All of them were ancient figures!

When Yang Ye and Luo Wuchen arrived here, everyone looked towards them. Or to be more precise, everyone gazed at Yang Ye.

Hao Tian grinned as a form of greeting.

Ying Jing glanced at Yang Ye and withdrew her gaze. After that, she closed her eyes.

The woman in a red dress nodded and withdrew her gaze.

Luo Wuchen and Yang Ye arrived in the pergola. He glanced at the others and said, “I presume I don’t have to introduce him, right?”

“Of course!” An old man in a luxurious robe smiled, “This young brother’s name is simply resounding throughout Heaven Pillar Mountain right now!”

Yang Ye gazed at the old man, and the latter grinned, “One of the three ancient cultivators, Gu Ya!” Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Yang Ye nodded slightly, “Yang Ye!”

Gu Ya smiled, “Please have a seat!”

Yang Ye nodded and found a seat for himself. There was a black robed man by his side. Suddenly, the man said, “This seat isn’t for you!”

Yang Ye shot a glance at the man, and then he gazed at Gu Ya, “Is he the owner of this place?”

Gu Ya shook his head slightly.

Yang Ye glanced at the black robed man and said, “So, it’s none of your fucking business!”

As soon as these words were spoken, the atmosphere here became quite tense.

Suddenly, a ray of black light appeared before Yang Ye’s forehead.

The black robed man had attacked!

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly. It was definitely extremely fast in the eyes of others, but as far as Yang Ye was concerned, it was very slow. However, he couldn’t dodge it. If he tried to dodge, he would be heavily injured even if he could avoid death!

Yang Ye didn’t dodge. He took a step forward, and a mysterious force appeared. An instant later, a ray of light flashed.

Hiss!

It sounded like something was sliced apart in midair.

An instant later, the Sword Domain vanished, and everything returned to normal.

The black robed man wanted to attack again, but Gu Ya suddenly said, “Qian Xie, I didn’t gather everyone here today to watch both of you fight.”

The black robed man, Qian Xie, said, “I just wanted to teach this rude junior a lesson. However, you’re right, we have important matters to discuss.”

Gu Ya nodded slightly, “Thank you for being understanding!”

Yang Ye glanced at Qian Xie and didn’t say a word.

Meanwhile, Gu Ya suddenly stood up and glanced at everyone here. He said, “All of you are the peak experts of this world, and you want to go to the large universe. However, I presume that some of you already understand, right?”

Yang Ye suddenly asked, “Understand what?”

Gu Ya glanced at him and smiled, “Do you know why all of us haven’t gone up there?”

Yang Ye shook his head.

Gu Ya replied, “It’s not that we don’t want to. After all, everyone wants to go to a higher place. We dare not go up there!”

They didn’t dare to go to the large universe!

Many people here frowned when they heard him, and their eyes were filled with bewilderment!

Gu Ya looked up at Heaven Pillar Mountain which towered into the sky, “During the ancient times, the Dao Progenitor and the others did create the barrier in order to protect the humans in the lower universes. However, as time passed, many things started to change.”

Everyone gazed at Gu Ya, and the latter chuckled, “I’ll be frank. Besides the barrier and the chaotic flow of space, there’s another threat in the upper universe. Hunters!”

Hunters!

Yang Ye frowned, “What’s that?”

Gu Ya smiled, “Those powerful organizations in the upper universe hunt the experts from the lower universes. The so-called weakening of the barrier is actually something they intentionally do from time to time.”

Suddenly, a beautiful woman asked, “Why?”

Gu Ya replied, “Their objective is very simple. They want to capture us, erase our memories, and then take control of us!”

Gu Ya glanced at the surroundings and said, “Everyone, from some point in time, our medium universe became a farm for the upper universe, and we are the animals in the farm. They nurture us until we’re fat, then slaughter us!”

Suddenly, Yang Ye said, “The ancestors of all eight clans in our universe have gone to the upper universe. Besides that, according to my knowledge, the Secret Sect’s Master is there too. But the Secret Sect’s Master clearly still possesses her memories!”

Gu Ya smiled, “How long have the eight clans existed for? At least tens of thousands of years, right? Just as I mentioned, in the beginning, those people did create the barrier to protect the lower universes. Yet now, it’s not anymore. Or I should say that things have changed. As for the Secret Sect’s Master who you mentioned, how do you know she isn’t under someone’s control?”

Yang Ye fell silent. If Gu Ya was right, then it was a truly shocking revelation.

Meanwhile, someone suddenly asked, “What about those fellows who come down here from the upper universe?”

Gu Ya explained, “Who were most of them? Besides those fleeing for their lives, it has been insignificant experts or those who descended here with some sort of mission. Some of them might know what those large organizations are doing, and some know nothing. After all, it’s nothing worth being proud of, and those large organizations have done well keeping it a secret!”

Yang Ye asked, “Senior, then how did you find out?”

Gu Ya grinned and remained silent. Meanwhile, Luo Wuchen suddenly said, “Brother Gu Ya broke through the barrier and went up there once. However, he came back!”

Gu Ya suddenly stretched out his arm, and then everyone noticed that he didn’t have a palm.

Gu Ya smiled, “If I hadn’t fled fast enough, I may have lost more than just a palm. I may have lost my life.” He glanced at them and continued, “I know that all of you are very confident in your strength, but do you know who tried to capture me?”

He suddenly gazed at Yang Ye at this point, “Do you know what severed my hand?”

Yang Ye shook his head.

Gu Ya replied, “The sword in your grasp.”

The expressions of everyone here changed when they heard this.

Everyone knew the origins of the sword in Yang Ye’s grasp. But Gu Ya said that it was that holy sword which had cut off his palm! What did that represent? It represented that even the Sovereign of Man had participated in it all those years ago!

The Sovereign of Man had participated!

Gu Ya said, “Everyone, don’t underestimate yourselves. After all, you’re geniuses amongst geniuses. Even if we can’t rule over an area after arriving at the upper universe, we are absolutely considered top-rate experts. If we’re given more time, would we even have to fear the Sovereign of Man? But that’s exactly why they won’t let us escape.”

Yang Ye closed his eyes slowly.

Yang Ye asked in his heart, “Senior, is that true?”

Hou Qing replied, “I’m not very sure. However, it does remind me of something. The large organizations of the human race, and especially the organization under the Sovereign of Man suddenly gained numerous experts. However, my shaman race thought they’d fostered those experts in secret. Now it would seem like that old man isn’t wrong. It’s very likely that those experts were experts from this medium universe!”

Yang Ye’s face fell when he heard this.

“Isn’t the Sovereign of Man said to be benevolent?” Suddenly, an old man said, “Would he do something like that?”

Gu Ya smiled, “Benevolent? Brother Mo, there is no such thing in this world. It’s a dog eat dog world. Even if benevolence does occasionally exist, it’s merely the pity of the strong towards the weak.”

Pity!

Silence suddenly filled the surroundings.

Everyone here was a top-rate expert, true top-rate experts, and they were absolutely confident in their strength. However, they knew something very well. While they were equivalent to invincible existences in the lower universe, they weren’t in the upper universe.

There were many people up there who could kill them, like the Sovereign of Man.

Meanwhile, Gu Ya said, “We’re limited by the spirit energy and world down here, so we’ve arrived at our limits. The only way to improve further and break through the bottlenecks we face is to head up there. Otherwise, the day will come when we die down here. However, if we want to live and be free once we get up there, we must fight against those powers in the upper universe!”

One of the old men suddenly asked, “Brother Gu Ya, what are you trying to say?”

Gu Ya closed his eyes slowly. A few breaths of time passed before he opened his eyes again, “It’s very simple. We’ll join forces and go up there together. If we work together, we’ll have a chance to survive.”

Work together!

All of them fell silent again.

Meanwhile, Gu Ya suddenly added, “The barrier will weaken again in two weeks. Are you willing to join forces and fight the experts of the upper universe?”
