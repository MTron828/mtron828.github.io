Chapter 2029 – Lacking a Part of the Soul!

Even though Yang Ye didn’t know why she was doing this, he didn’t want to waste time on her.

He was only here to return a favor.

The woman’s expression became quite unsightly when she heard this. She hadn’t expected Yang Ye to be so direct. Of course, she was even more furious that Yang Ye didn’t give her any face!

In her life, it was the first time she’d encounter someone who refused to give her any face.

As for the man, he was quite displeased.

He walked over to Ji Lian and stood in front of her before looking Yang Ye in the eyes. After that, he swung a slap at Yang Ye’s face.

If it hit, Yang Ye’s teeth would be smacked out of his mouth!

Yang Ye would naturally not let the man hit him, and he just swung a punch instead!

Bang!

Jiang Hua was instantly blasted over 300m away!

Once he stopped himself, he looked down at his right hand, and he noticed that the bones in it had shattered!

Jiang Hua’s expression instantly became ferocious. He looked up at Yang Ye and said, “So you’re a body cultivator!”

He was about to attack after he finished speaking.

Suddenly, a voice came from the side, “Stop!”

Yang Ye looked over, and he saw Ji Yue approaching in her wheelchair, and the masked old man was behind her.

Jiang Hua didn’t attack again. He spoke solemnly, “Miss Yue, he insulted…”

Ji Yue shook her head slightly and interrupted him, “Young Miss Jiang, please go take a rest. I’ll deal with the matters here!”

Jiang Hua’ face became quite unsightly.

“Hmm?” Ji Yue gazed at him, “What?”

Jiang Hua glanced at Yang Ye and left.

Ji Lian wanted to leave too, but Ji Yue suddenly said, “Lian’er, go think about your actions.”

“Oh!” She glared at Yang Ye and vanished into the distance.

Once they left, Ji Yue gazed at Yang Ye, “My sister is young, and she can’t forget what happened that day. That was why she acted like that. However, she doesn’t hold any ill intent towards you, so I hope you don’t mind.”

Yang Ye nodded, “It’s nothing.”

Ji Yue replied, “That’s good to hear. Please come with me!”

As soon as she finished speaking, she left Yang Ye to the right, and it didn’t take long for them to arrive at a bamboo forest. There was a small river behind the bamboo forest. Its water was so clear one could see its bottom, and there was a bamboo house behind the river.

Ji Yue said, “This is where I usually meditate. It’s very quiet, so you can stay here for now. Don’t worry, no one will disturb you here!”

Yang Ye said, “When are we going to unseal that divine beast of your clan?”

She replied, “Three days! We’ll set out in three days!”

Yang Ye nodded, and then he walked over to the bamboo house. Suddenly, Ji Yue said, “Brother Yang!”

Yang Ye turned to look at her.

She said, “Brother Yang, my Ji Clan may not be the only clan there when the time comes.”

Yang Ye was quite puzzled by this, “Huh?”

She explained, “It’s a place owned jointly by the four clans. So, the members of the other clans may be there too.”

“And?” Yang Ye asked, “Are you afraid that I’ll enter into conflict with them?”

She nodded slightly, “One of the clans is on the Sovereign of Man’s side.”

Yang Ye smiled, “I don’t offend unless offended!”

Yang Ye vanished on the spot.

Ji Yue fell silent for a short while, and then she left with the masked old man.

In the bamboo house, Yang Ye sat cross-legged on a bamboo chair, and then he entered the Primordial Pagoda.

He went to the 2nd level, and Zi’er was still lying unconscious there.

Yang Ye gazed at Little Sky and asked, “How is she?”

Little Sky spoke softly, “I checked her carefully, and I noticed that her soul is gradually recovering, and her body is fine too. However…”

Yang Ye asked, “What?”

She said, “I noticed that she is lacking a part of her soul. The most important part too!”

Yang Ye’s face instantly turned gloomy, “Was it the Sovereign of Sky?”

Little Sky shook her head, “I’m not sure. It may be an issue that occurred while separating Xiao Qi’s soul from her body. So, you have to ask Xiao Qi.”

Yang Ye spoke in a low voice, “Why didn’t you tell me earlier?”

Little Sky replied, “If I did, you wouldn’t have left the Sky Dimension, right?”

Yang Ye fell silent.

Little Sky said, “Your strength isn’t sufficient now, so you can’t fight the entire sky race at all. That’s why I could only wait for you to leave the Sky Dimension before telling you. I was afraid you'd act rashly and give your life away!”

Yang Ye spoke softly, “I understand. Don’t worry, I won’t go looking for him until I’m confident enough!”

Little Sky nodded and said, “Once Zi’er is awake, I want to return to Merak System to have a look.”

Yang Ye gazed at her, “I’ll go back with you!”

She grinned, “Alright!”

After chatting with Little Sky for some time, Yang Ye started cultivating. He was at the Hear Dao Realm now. While his strength was on par with some Zen Realm experts, and he would even kill them, his cultivation was still too low.

He had to continue improving himself!

Time trickled by, and a month passed in the Primordial Pagoda. Throughout this month, the only thing Yang Ye did every single day was cultivate and play with Snowy. Something worth mentioning was that Snowy had grown larger. Besides that, her fur was even whiter than before. It was like frost now. Snowy didn’t know why this had happened.

Yang Ye asked Little Sky, and the latter’s explanation was that Snowy was on the verge of advancing.

Advancing!

Snowy was a Sprite Lord. A Sprite Lord like Snowy wasn’t just a lord in one area, she was a Sprite Lord in the entire universe. All the universes only had goodwill towards a being like Snowy.

Sprite Lords could advance too. However, she didn’t know much about Sprite Lords. Because while there had been a Sprite Lord in Merak System, that Sprite Lord had left Merak System. Moreover, Snowy was unlike other Sprite Lords. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

She was a Sprite Lord who’d grown up while bathing in Primordial Violet Energy!

Once he heard Little Sky, Yang Ye looked down at Snowy who’d fallen asleep in his arms and chuckled, “I wonder how she’ll be after she advances!”

Yang Ye really looked forward to Snowy’s future.

Three days had passed. Yang Ye passed Snowy to Little Sky and left the Primordial Pagoda.

Yang Ye took a deep breath once he left the bamboo house.

While he hadn’t advanced in the last month, he’d gained quite a bit. These gains were mostly an improvement in his mental state. Because he’d gained some comprehensions after watching the battle between that Sage and the Unfettered One, and he’d used the last month to absorb all of it and then he gained even more comprehensions!

While these comprehensions couldn’t immediately improve his strength, they were absolutely beneficial to the improvement of his Sword Dao!

It was a huge gain!

Suddenly, the masked old man pushed Ji Yue towards Yang Ye.

Ji Yue asked, “Brother Yang, are you ready?”

Yang Ye glanced at her and said, “Anytime!”

She nodded slightly, “Then come with me!”

The old man started pushing her away, and Yang Ye immediately followed them.

It didn’t take long for them to leave the city. There was a middle aged man outside the city. He gazed at Yang Ye and said, “The Ji Clan’s patriarch, Ji Wuyun!”

Yang Ye cupped his fist, “Nice to meet you!”

The middle aged man nodded slightly and said, “I’ll leave it to you!”

Yang Ye said, “It’s my duty!”

The middle aged man nodded and gazed at Ji Yue, “Be careful.”

Ji Yue replied, “There’s no need to worry!”

The middle aged man didn’t say another word and just waved his right hand. A moment later, a carriage shot down from the sky and descended before them.

It was huge, and it could accommodate at least 100 people.

Moreover, it was being pulled by dragons.

Yang Ye glanced at them. They were black dragons, and they were at the Dao Realm at least! Yang Ye glanced at Ji Wuyun, and he knew that the Ji Clan was definitely not ordinary since it could make dragons willingly pull their carriages!

Ji Yue suddenly said, “Brother Yang, please come with me!”

Yang Ye didn’t refuse and entered the carriage, and then he casually found a place for himself.

Meanwhile, Ji Yue entered as well. However, the masked old man didn’t come with her.

Ji Yue said, “Uncle Jiang will be driving us!”

Yang Ye nodded, and then he gazed at Ji Yue’s wheelchair. He hesitated for a moment and asked, “Miss Ji Yue, what’s wrong with your legs?”

She chuckled, “I can’t feel them due to certain reasons!”

Yang Ye said, “I’m quite good at healing. Do you want me to try?”

She spoke softly, “Even a Sage once tried to help me. Unfortunately, it didn’t work.”

“Oh.” Yang Ye didn’t say anything else.

Meanwhile, she said, “However, you can try!”

Yang Ye asked, “Didn’t you say even a Sage failed?”

She smiled, “You’re not an ordinary person. Perhaps there’ll be a miracle? In any case, you can try. I won’t lose anything, right?”

He smiled, “You have a very good mentality and you’re a very casual person. You’re not ordinary at all!”

She grinned and didn’t say anything.

Yang Ye stood up and walked over to her, and then he gazed at her legs. Her expression remained normal, and she didn’t seem bothered at all.

Yang Ye didn’t seem bothered either. He just placed his hand on her leg, and then Primordial Violet Energy flowed out slowly. It didn’t take long for Primordial Violet Energy to enter her legs, and then a trace of surprise flashed through her eyes.

Suddenly, Yang Ye’s expression changed drastically.

Bang!

Yang Ye was blasted away by a wave of energy.

Boom!

The entire carriage shook violently.

Yang Ye stood up slowly, and then he noticed to his shock that his hands had exploded apart. Blood was flowing incessantly from them!

Besides that, a huge multicolored bolt of lightning suddenly descended from the sky, and it was shooting straight for the carriage!

Yang Ye was stunned when he sensed it. What have I done?
