Chapter 2511 – Didn’t You Hear Me?!

At this moment, both Yang Ye and the old man were stunned on the spot!

Remove the patriarch from his position?

Yang Ye was stunned for quite some time before he said, “Miss Zhibei, um…. You can do that?”

She glanced at him, “I can!”

Yang Ye was stunned speechless.

“Eldest Young Miss!” The gray robed old man was about to say something.

However, Ye Zhibei waved her hand, “Return to the clan.”

As soon as she finished speaking, she ignored the old man and vanished into the distance with Yang Ye.

The old man shook his head and sighed.

Their Eldest Young Miss was amazing in all aspects, and her only flaw was being too overbearing at times!

Remove the patriarch!

It only sounded easy!RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

However, he was very well aware that if she was determined to do it, then it was really possible!

The old man sighed once more and hurried after them.

…

In the clouds, Yang Ye went to Ye Zhibei’s side, “Miss Ye, it really isn’t necessary to enter into conflict with your clan for me. I…”

She glanced at him and interrupted him, “It’s not entirely for you!”

Yang Ye was quite puzzled, “Then why?”

Ye Zhibei replied indifferently, “I’m certain people in the War City and the outside world are aware that I’m taking you back to the clan. If my Ye Clan chooses to abandon you because of the Leng Clan now, what would the world think of my Ye Clan? What would our branch families think of the main family?”

She looked up at the sky and continued, “My father is old.”

Actually, she hadn’t said something else. She was doing it because she’d experienced some things with Yang Ye, and she knew his strength better than the Ye Clan. It could be said that both she and Xing Biqing weren’t confident in being able to defeat Yang Ye.

Yang Ye was a sword cultivator!

A Three World Realm sword cultivator, and one who cultivated in the body too.

He could kill Five World Realm experts at the Two World Realm, yet now, he was at the Three World Realm, so how strong was he?

Ye Zhibei hadn’t been acting rashly. She’d considered everything well, and she knew that while accepting Yang Ye would offend the Leng Clan, the Leng Clan and her Ye Clan would not fight to the death. Meanwhile, the Ye Clan would gain an extraordinary genius.

It was beneficial, very beneficial!

It didn't take long for them to arrive at the Ye Clan.

The Ye Clan was within a special barrier. It was a world that had been specially created, and while it was called a clan, it was more like a city.

There were two old men waiting outside the city’s gates!

Two more Five World Realm experts!

It wasn’t that the Ye Clan had countless Five World Realm experts, it was because of Ye Zhibei’s own unique status. That was why the Ye Clan had sent Five World Realm experts to welcome her.

Ye Zhibei led Yang Ye to the city gates, and the old men bowed slightly to her.

Ye Zhibei said, “The Leng Clan’s people are still here?”

One of them nodded, “He’s still in a meeting with the patriarch!”

Ye Zhibei asked, “What are they discussing?”

The old man glanced at Yang Ye and was slightly hesitant.

Ye Zhibei’s face instantly turned icy cold, and then she flicked a ray of blue light into the sky.

The old men’s expressions changed drastically when they witnessed this.

One of them spoke with astonishment, “Eldest Young Miss, you…”

Ye Zhibei didn’t say anything. She just gazed behind her. It didn’t take long for a black robed figure to appear there. The black robed figure’s robe was very wide and enveloped the person within it completely, so it was impossible to see the person’s actual figure.

However, the black robed figure’s aura was fully revealed before them.

It wasn’t the Five World Realm but the Lord Realm!

A true Lord Realm expert!

Yang Ye was quite shocked as well, and he wondered what she was planning!

Meanwhile, the black robed figure bowed slightly to her.

Ye Zhibei gazed at the two old men, “Go gather everyone immediately, including the next patriarchs of the branch families. I have something to announce!”

The old man exchanged glances, and then one of them hesitated and was about to speak, but she suddenly walked over to him and said, “I told you to go. Didn’t you hear me?”

The old man was shocked. At this moment, he realized that she was serious!

He didn’t dare to challenge her authority. They bowed to her and left.

Ye Zhibei glanced into the distance and said, “Aunt Luo, you’ll take my side, right?”

The black robed figure replied, “What if I say no?”

Ye Zhibei suddenly chuckled, “That’s great! In any case, I’m not interested in being the Ye Clan’s patriarch.”

The black robed figure said, “Are you trying to force us?”

Ye Zhibei gazed at the black robed figure, “It’s the Ye Clan that’s forcing me. Since you wish to foster me to become the next patriarch, and I have to bear responsibility for the clan’s future… Fine, I accept. But I want authority now, I want full authority over the clan!”

The black robed figure replied, “It isn’t time.”

Ye Zhibei replied indifferently, “I think it is!”

The black robed figure spoke calmly, “All of us will only take the side that’s beneficial to the Ye Clan. I’m only here because you’re not a rash person, and I want to see why you wish to remove your father from his position just for an illegitimate child. Moreover, you even want to become enemies with the Leng Clan for that.”

Ye Zhibei nodded slightly, “Then just watch and see!”

The black robed figure replied, “You’ve gone too far. You know the consequences if you can’t provide a reasonable explanation.”

Ye Zhibei chuckled, “Of course.”

She gazed at Yang Ye, “Let’s go!”

She walked into the city.

Yang Ye glanced up at the city. The patriarch? It’s a position that brings many great things like authority, resources, and reputation, but isn’t it a type of shackles too?

It’s best to be alone!

One man, one sword!

Yang Ye shook his head, grinned, and followed her into the city.

Ye Zhibei led Yang Ye to the main hall of the Ye Clan. At this moment, no less than 100 people were gathered here. There were people from the branch families and main family. All of them were the core experts of the Ye Clan.

There were three chairs in the hall. A middle aged man sat at the seat of the host. He had a calm and indifferent expression, and an elegant appearance. The middle aged man was the current patriarch of the Ye Clan, Ye Ruxuan!

A white-robed old man sat on Ye Ruxuan’s right. It was the Ye Clan’s Grand Elder, an absolute core figure of the clan.

As for Ye Ruxuan’s left, it was a middle aged man. He wasn’t from the Ye Clan, he was an elder of the Leng Clan!

Everyone gazed at Ye Zhibei when they saw Ye Zhibei’s group of three walk in, but it didn’t take long for them to gaze at Yang Ye.

Yang Ye’s face was calm, and he didn’t say anything.

Ye Zhibei glanced at the others here. In the end, her gaze descended onto the elder from the Leng Clan, “I didn’t expect to see someone from the Leng Clan here!”

Ye Ruxuan suddenly said, “I asked Brother Leng Gu to stay!”

Ye Zhibei glanced at her father, “Brother Ye is a member of our clan. Now, I want him to return to our clan!”

“No!” Ye Ruxuan shook his head, “His identity hasn’t been confirmed, so he isn’t a member of our clan!”

Ye Zhibei replied indifferently, “I said he is, so he is!”

Ye Ruxuan replied indifferently, “I’m the patriarch right now.”

Ye Zhibei walked over to Ye Ruxuan, and then someone brought her a chair.

She sat down and said, “Just be frank. What did the Leng Clan promise you?”

Meanwhile, the elder from the Leng Clan smiled, “Young Miss Ye, my Leng Clan and the Ye Clan have been on friendly terms, and we hope this friendship can last! Moreover, my patriarch has promised that when faced with a choice between the Ye Clan and the East Region’s Lu Clan, we will choose the Ye Clan!”

Ye Zhibei finally understood at this point.

The Leng Clan and the East Region’s Lu Clan weren’t irreconcilable enemies, but their interests were entangled. If the Leng Clan took the Ye Clan’s side, it would obviously be extremely beneficial to the Ye Clan.

After all, the Xing Clan and Leng Clan had been just watching the Ye Clan and Lu Clan fight it out until now.

Meanwhile, the Leng Clan’s elder smiled, “Miss Ye, his origins are unknown, and he has killed many experts of my Leng Clan. Everyone knows about that, so if my Leng Clan doesn’t do anything about it, I’m afraid it wouldn’t be right! As a friend of my Leng Clan, the Ye Clan will definitely stand by our side, right?”

Ye Ruxuan stood up, and he glanced at Ye Zhibei with slightly complicated emotions in his eyes, “At most times, you only consider your own thoughts, but I view things from the angle of the clan as a whole. You’re still young, and you aren’t qualified to be the Ye Clan’s patriarch yet!”

As he spoke, he gazed at the black robed figure behind Ye Zhibei, “What do you think, Elder Luo?”

The black robed figure remained silent.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye stepped forward, “I think you’re wrong!”

Everyone gazed at Yang Ye.

The black robed figure gazed at Yang Ye too!

Ye Ruxuan gazed at Yang Ye and spoke indifferently, “I didn’t ask you!”

Yang Ye walked over to Ye Zhibei’s side and smiled, “I can’t speak just because you didn’t ask?”

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings, “I’m sure it’s very common in the Ye Clan and Leng Clan to discard your own for the clan’s own interests. Especially when the person has no status or talent. As far as all of you are concerned, such members of the clan are just trash, and they are just a waste of resources. Right?”

He gazed at Ye Zhibei and grinned, “Stop looking around, you are included too. Allow me to be honest, Miss Zhibei, if it wasn’t due to certain things, would you even bring me back here? Would you go against your father, clan, and even the Leng Clan for me?”

Ye Zhibei gazed at him in silence.

Yang Ye smiled, “Of course, I can’t say that what you’ve done is wrong. After all, the clan’s interests come first, right? But…”

Yang Ye grinned at this point, but it was slightly cold, “To be honest, I really look down on all of you. As far as all of you are concerned, benefits and interests are everything, it’s even greater than the lives of your people. What are your people to you? They are your loved ones! Many are even linked to you by blood, but because their talent or strength is insufficient, they are worthless in the eyes of people like you who manage the entire clan, right? No, I should say there is no love in clans, and everything is based upon talent. If you have talent, the clan loves you; if you have no talent, perhaps your status in the clan is worse than a dog!”

Ye Ruxuan gazed coldly at Yang Ye, “Subdue him!”

It only took a moment for two experts at the Five World Realm to appear behind Yang Ye.

Ye Zhibei was about to say something when a sword howl resounded.

Along with the sword howl, a sword flashed, and then the head of an old man flew up into the air!

At this moment, the hall almost froze in silence!

Ye Ruxuan’s hands were even trembling while disbelief filled his eyes!
