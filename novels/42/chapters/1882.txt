Chapter 1883 – How Do You Want To Die?

The ancient city!

A ray of light descended from the sky and entered the city. But it didn’t take long for the ray of light to charge up into the sky and shoot swiftly into the distance.

In the starry sky.

Yang Ye shot forward swiftly on his sword while Su Qingshi stood behind him.

As soon as he returned to the Yang Clan, Yang Ye found out that the three young girls had left, and for the first time, he felt quite anxious.

They were absolutely important to him.

Regardless of whether it was Xue’er, Bao’er, or Lei Lin, their status in his heart was no different. He wouldn’t allow anything to happen to any one of them!

Su Qingshi wrapped her arms around Yang Ye from behind, “They should be in Heaven Pillar Mountain.”

“Heaven Pillar Mountain?!” Yang Ye asked, “Why?”

She replied softly, “Xue’er has been constantly talking about going to see her dad.”

Yang Ye’s heart hurt when he heard this.

Su Qingshi tightened her embrace and said, “I’m sorry.”

Yang Ye shook his head, “It’s my mistake. I haven’t really spent much time with all of you.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he twisted his right foot slightly, and the sword beneath him trembled before flashing forward.

…

Heaven Pillar Mountain.

The three of them clearly attracted quite a bit of attention in the interior of Heaven Pillar Mountain. Because they were truly too weak. So, divine senses frequently swept past them, and most of them stopped on Lei Lin.

Sprite Kings were perfect for being Equipment Spirits.

However, very few took action because they wanted to figure out what was going on!

As far as they were concerned, there weren't any ordinary people in the interior of Heaven Pillar Mountain. They were so weak yet dared to come here, so there was definitely something unusual about them.

Something was off!

Something was really off!

Even if they wanted to act against the girls, they were forced back when they heard Yang Nianxue mention that her dad was Yang Ye.

The worst person to offend in Heaven Pillar Mountain right now was Yang Ye!

He was a god of death!

Moreover, as far as they were concerned, Yang Ye was definitely hiding in the shadows.

So, all of them cupped their fists towards the surroundings and apologized before they left.

Just like that, they marched forward without suffering any obstruction, and it didn’t take long for them to arrive on the 10th level, the world of the Xenosprites.

Yang Nianxue spoke softly as she gazed at the mist around them, “This place feels very uncomfortable. Let’s leave!”

Bao’er nodded with agreement.

They gazed at Lei Lin, and the latter understood them. She waved her hand, and a lightning dragon appeared before them.

Right when they were about to leave, an ear piercing and sharp noise resounded.

It was deafening!

At the same time, a ray of black light flashed out of the mist and charged at them.

All three of them were horrified!

Bao’er hurriedly pulled on the corner of Yang Nianxue’s sleeve, “Hurry! Say something! Hurry…”

Suddenly, Lei Lin shouted, “Yang Ye’s her father!”

However, the ray of black light didn’t slow down at all.

Lei Lin’s eyes opened wide at the sight of this, “Didn’t you hear me…?”

Right when it was about to envelop them, a ray of green light flashed, and it instantly shattered the black light.

A moment later, a violet Xenosprite appeared before them.

Lei Lin spoke coldly, “So ugly!”

The Xenosprite’s eyes instantly became icy cold.

Meanwhile, Bao’er quickly pulled Lei Lin behind her and said, “Er… er… you’re not that ugly.”

The Xenosprite was speechless.

A short while passed before the Xenosprite spoke in a low voice, “Where’s Yang Ye?”

Yang Nianxue was about to speak when Bao’er said, “He… he said he’ll be here soon!”

“He’s coming here?” The Xenosprite’s eyelids twitched, “What’s he coming here for?”

Bao’er thought for a moment and replied, “To play!”

The Xenosprite felt speechless again.

Meanwhile, Bao’er added, “We… we’re here to play too!”

The Xenosprite glanced coldly at them and said, “Leave this place. Tell Yang Ye our race doesn’t wish to become enemies with him, but we won’t just let others bully us.”

He hesitated for a moment and flicked a spatial ring to Bao’er, “There are 30 Sprite Cores in there. Tell him that it should be enough for him.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he vanished on the spot.

The three young girls gazed at the spatial ring and were quite stunned.

Yang Nianxue hesitated for a moment and said, “We… didn’t say anything about extorting him!”

Bao’er put the spatial ring away and said, “We can’t go any higher. We have to look for the Little Laborer!”

At this moment, she’d finally realized how much danger they were in. While Yang Ye’s name worked well, what if someone didn’t know Yang Ye?

Yang Nianxue hesitated for a moment and nodded.

Even though she was quite carefree, she was no fool. She knew that they weren’t in a very good situation right now!

They didn’t run around at random anymore, and they went down to the 9th level instead. They were about to continue their descent when the blue passageway in the sky of the 9th level trembled. All three of them looked up at the passageway.

Yang Nianxue spoke softly, “What’s happening?”

Bao’er shook her head, “I don’t know!”

Yang Nianxue said, “It seems like something is coming!”

Bao’er replied, “Ignore it. Let’s go look for the Little Laborer.”

As she spoke, she took Yang Nianxue and Lei Lin’s hands with the intent to leave. However, the blue passageway suddenly shook violently, and then a ray of golden light shot out from it. The gold light dispersed to reveal a man in golden armor with a spear in his hand. He’d appeared not too far away from Yang Nianxue and the others.

Someone from the upper universe!

The golden armored man closed his eyes slowly. A long time passed before the golden light around him calmed down completely. After that, he opened his eyes and glanced at the surroundings, “I’m here from the upper universe under orders from the Sovereign of Man. I’m here to kill the one who has strayed from the path of humanity, Yang Ye! Does anyone know where he is?”

He wants to kill Yang Ye! Bao’er and the others immediately stopped. Yang Nianxue gazed at the golden armored man and wanted to say something, but Bao’er hurriedly covered her mouth.

Bao’er shook her head, and then she slowly pulled Yang Nianxue and Lei Lin backwards.

Meanwhile, a moment of silence ensued before a voice resounded, “Why does the Sovereign of Man want to kill Yang Ye?”

The golden armored man looked to his right, “He hasn’t just cultivated a devil cultivation technique, he has cultivated the techniques of the shaman race. The holy sword can’t be allowed to fall into his hands. If you know where he is, you can tell me.” He withdrew a golden shield, “This is a high-grade Imperial Rank treasure. It belongs to anyone who knows where Yang Ye is!”

The voice resounded again, “Your understanding of Yang Ye is outdated. He has changed tremendously. So, if you really want to kill him, it’s best to come after you gain an accurate understanding of his strength!”

The armored man spoke indifferently, “That’s my business.”

A few moments of silence ensued, and then the voice resounded once more, “I don’t know where he is, but I know how to find him.”

The armored man said, “Speak!”

The voice said, “See those three little girls down there? One of them says that she’s Yang Ye’s daughter. If you capture her, I’m sure that Yang Ye will definitely show himself!”

Bao’er’s expression changed drastically when she heard this, and she immediately pulled the others along with her as she dashed away.

However, a strand of mysterious energy suddenly enveloped them, and they were unable to move another inch.

Suddenly, a middle aged man appeared by their side.

It was the Ancient Emperor.

The Ancient Emperor smiled at the man in golden armor and said, “According to my knowledge, the Sovereign of Man is a benevolent sovereign in the upper universe, and he’s one of our human race’s leaders. However, I’m unable to respect what you’ve done since arriving here in the lower universe!”

The man glanced at the Ancient Emperor and said, “Since the ancient times, those who achieve great things don’t let trifles stop them. So long as the outcome is good, is there anything wrong with being a little unscrupulous during the process of it?”

The Ancient Emperor chuckled, “Is there anything wrong? If news of how you intended to use a few young girls to threaten Yang Ye were to be spread to the upper dimension, it wouldn’t be very good for the Sovereign of Man’s reputation, right?”

The man looked the Ancient Emperor in the eyes, “I did it, so what does it have to do with the Sovereign of Man? Moreover, who would spread news of it to the upper dimension? You? Allow me to be honest, I’m afraid you won’t have the chance to do that!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he tapped a finger forward lightly. The golden spear in his grasp transformed into a ray of golden light that shot towards the Ancient Emperor.

The Ancient Emperor’s face remained calm as he pressed his index and middle fingers together before tapping them forward. The space before him was torn open, and then a spear shot out from it and collided with the golden light.

Boom!

A loud explosion resounded, and the golden light dispersed.

The armored man glanced at his spear and said, “You’re quite strong.”

As soon as he finished speaking, his figure transformed into a ray of golden light that vanished on the spot.

The Ancient Emperor was about to attack when a golden talisman appeared in the air above him. An instant later, a fist-sized golden character floated out from it.

'镇 '!

As soon as it appeared…

Bang! ''!

The Ancient Emperor was blasted over 10km away.

The armored man laughed coldly, “It was given to me by the Sovereign of Man. It’s not something you can resist!”

As he spoke, his gaze descended onto Bao’er and the others, and then he waved his right hand. A wave of aura swept towards them.

The three of them were holding hands while their eyes were closed tight. Especially Lei Lin, her body was trembling incessantly while she ceaselessly repeated, “I won’t be playful again. I’ll never be playful again…” Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

A ray of light flashed.

The armored man’s aura was instantly obliterated.

At the same time, a voice resounded, “Tell me, how do you want to die?”
