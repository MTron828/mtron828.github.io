Chapter 1695 - Let’s Fight!

Self-detonation!

Self-detonation of a True Realm expert!

No one had expected that Yang Zhen would actually detonate himself! After all, how difficult was it to cultivate to the True Realm?

Yet now, Yang Zhen had actually detonated himself in order to save Yang Ye!

A terrifying aura surged out from Yang Zhen like waves. Yang Gu and the others didn’t dare to go head-on against it, and they retreated simultaneously. Even though the self-detonation of a True Realm expert couldn’t kill them, it was absolutely capable of injuring them. Once they were heavily injured, they wouldn’t dare to chase after Yang Ye.

After all, Yang Ye wasn’t a weakling!

Yang Zhen looked up at Yang Ye’s shrinking figure, and he said, “A day as a brother, a lifetime as a brother…”

Boom!

An instant later, a rumbling explosion resounded through Phecda City. The space around Yang Zhen collapsed in an instant, and the collapse of space was spreading rapidly towards the surroundings. In less than half a breath of time, space in an area of over 50,000km had collapsed into a pitch black hole.

Moreover, the black hole was still expanding!

However, a strand of mysterious energy suddenly appeared here, and then space instantly stopped collapsing before it started to return to normal.

Three breaths of time later, everything had calmed down.

At this moment, Yang Ye, Qiong Qi, and An Nanjing had fled Heaven Void Continent, and they were in the starry sky.

Yang Ye stood silently on Qiong Qi’s back, and his heart was filled with quite complicated emotions.

He knew that Yang Zhen had detonated himself, but he hadn’t expected that Yang Zhen would actually not hesitate to detonate himself in order to save him. Of course, it was definitely because of his father.

Suddenly, Qiong Qi said, “Kid, we won’t make it!”

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts when he heard this. He was about to speak when he suddenly looked up towards the distance. Space there suddenly trembled, and then a black hand suddenly emerged from that expanse of space and slapped down at Yang Ye’s group.

Dangerous!

Extremely dangerous!

That was what Yang Ye felt right now, and he wasn’t the only one because Qiong Qi and An Nanjing had solemn expressions on their faces as well.

Qiong Qi spoke solemnly, “Together!”

An Nanjing and Yang Ye nodded slightly, and then An Nanjing tossed Skysplit towards the black hand.

Hiss!

Skysplit tore through space as it shot towards the hand. When it arrived around 30m away, countless spear images suddenly appeared around Skysplit. There were no less than a thousand of them, and it only took a moment for the images and Skysplit itself to slam against the huge hand.

Bang!

As soon as they came into contact, the spear images exploded into bits. As for Skysplit, it was slapped back into An Nanjing’s grasp by the powerful force within the hand. At the moment Skysplit returned to her grasp, the powerful force it carried pushed her around 3km back!

But the hand had merely turned slightly translucent!

Meanwhile, a ray of light flashed. Everywhere the sword energy passed, space was instantly sliced into bits. However, it instantly exploded apart upon colliding with the huge hand.

Yang Ye and An Nanjing’s faces fell when they witnessed this.

Meanwhile, Qiong Qi leaped forward and slammed himself against the huge hand.

Bang!

The hand trembled violently and shattered apart. As for Qiong Qi, he was blasted over 10km away.

Meanwhile, Yang Gu and the others had arrived not too far away from Yang Ye’s group.

They’d caught up!

Yang Gu gazed coldly at Yang Ye, “How can my Yang Clan let you escape when it has come to this? If you don’t kill a tiger you attack, it’ll always be a potential threat. We know that well.”

The Yang Clan had paid a huge price to kill Yang Ye. If they allowed Yang Ye to escape, then not to mention the humiliation they would suffer, based on Yang Ye’s natural talent and potential, he would definitely become a formidable enemy for the Yang Clan.

Yang Ye slowly tightened his grip on the wooden sword and was about to attack. However, Qiong Qi’s voice resounded in his mind, “Kid, be careful! There’s another expert who’s staying hidden! That person is much stronger than them! So, don’t be careless!”

Yang Ye nodded slightly, glanced at the surroundings, and then he gazed at Yang Gu, “If I’m not wrong, all of you are injured, right?”

Yang Gu spoke indifferently, “Aren’t all of you injured too?”

A moment of silence ensued, and then Yang Ye suddenly gazed at Qiong Qi. The latter immediately slapped his claws at the space in front of them.

Bang!

Qiong Qi’s powerful strength instantly collapsed a huge expanse of space, and then Yang Ye transformed into a ray of light that vanished on the spot.

Yang Gu and the others’ expressions changed drastically when space collapsed. Even though Yang Ye was terrifying when he didn’t have the help of a black hole in space, he wasn’t extremely terrifying. But once he had a black hole in space to help him, then coupled with the Undying Intents and wooden sword in his possession, Yang Ye’s combat strength would instantly multiply by countless times!

So, when they saw space collapse, Yang Gu and the others hurriedly repaired it. The joint forces of the seven of them instantly repaired the space here. However, their faces grew even more unsightly.

Because one of them was dead now, and it was the black clothed figure from the Shadow Guard.

As for Yang Ye, he had a dagger stuck in his chest. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

The dagger was from the final counterattack of that expert from the Shadow Guard, and it was the price Yang Ye paid to kill him. Because Yang Ye hadn’t chosen to defend himself at that instant, and he’d chosen to risk his life to kill his opponent!

If he hadn’t done that and chose to defend himself instead, then he wouldn’t have been able to kill that True Realm expert. After all, there were six other True Realm experts here. So long as they were given even a little time, he would definitely be unable to kill any one of them.

Even though there was a dagger in his chest, it wasn’t very bad for Yang Ye. Because his body was extremely strong, so that black clothed expert’s final attack hadn’t been able to pierce through him and stab into his heart. Coupled with the help he received from the Primordial Violet Energy within him, the injury didn’t affect him much!

Yang Gu and the others’ expressions became extremely unsightly when they saw Yang Ye had killed a True Realm expert in an instant. At the same time, they became extremely vigilant.

Yang Ye glanced at the dagger in his chest. He grabbed it and pulled it out slowly. As soon as he pulled it out, a strand of blood sprayed out from the wound. However, it only took a short while for the injury to heal at a visible rate.

Yang Gu and the others’ expressions grew even more unsightly when they witnessed this scene.

Yang Ye’s ability to self-heal was much more terrifying than his Laws of Darkness. If it was any other ordinary person, fighting such a drawn out battle would have exhausted that person to death. However, up until this point in the battle, not only had Yang Ye shown no signs of being exhausted to death, he’d exhausted all their strengths and rendered them heavily injured.

Suddenly, Qiong Qi raised his claws and slapped them down towards the space before him. In an instant, Qiong Qi’s powerful strength blasted space open again, causing Yang Gu and the others’ expressions to instantly change drastically!

The space here wasn’t as strong as the space on Heaven Void Continent, so Qiong Qi could make a huge expanse of space collapse with absolute ease. Once space collapsed, Yang Ye’s strength would rise to a horrifying level.

At the moment space collapsed, Yang Ye had instantly vanished on the spot. Yang Ye wasn’t the only one who’d attack. An Nanjing had tossed Skysplit forward at the same time.

Hiss!

Skysplit tore through space. Everywhere it passed, even the black hole warped before it.

At the instant An Nanjing tossed Skysplit, a ray of light flashed!

At the same time, numerous powerful auras rippled out from within the black hole.

Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!

The entire black hole started trembling violently like an earthquake was surging through it.

Three breaths of time later, everything returned to normal.

At this moment, there were only five of them left.

One more was dead.

It was the other member of the Shadow Guard.

Yang Gu and the others’ expressions grew even more unsightly. Besides that, their faces were covered in fear! True fear!

They weren’t in the Yang Clan’s territory anymore, so space could be shattered with ease. Moreover, they weren’t able to utilize the formations to fortify space here. So, Yang Ye, Qiong Qi, and An Nanjing’s joint forces had become a huge threat to them.

Yang Ye glanced at them, and then a cold smile gradually curled up on the corners of his mouth. A moment later, Qiong Qi suddenly slammed his claws forward again, and the powerful force within them instantly obliterated the space around them.

At exactly the same moment, Yang Ye and An Nanjing attacked. However, right when they entered the black hole, the black hole suddenly went still. It wasn’t just the black hole, everything in the surroundings seemed to have frozen.

A moment later, a huge black hand suddenly appeared within the black hole.

Bang!

An instant later, a rumbling explosion resounded, and then space returned to normal. Meanwhile, Yang Ye, Qiong Qi, and An Nanjing had moved over 10km back. Moreover, the huge black hand was floating above their heads.

Qiong Qi’s head had sunk down while there was blood on the corners of both Yang Ye and An Nanjing’s mouths. Obviously, the huge hand had injured all three of them just now.

Yang Ye wiped off the blood on the corner of his mouth, and then he looked towards an expanse of space in the distance. He laughed fiercely, “If I’m not wrong, you’re the Yang Clan’s patriarch, right?”

A moment of silence ensued, and then a voice came from there, “You exceeded my expectations. You…”

Suddenly, Yang Ye pointed the wooden sword in the voice’s direction, “Cut the fucking crap! Let’s just be a little direct! Let’s fight!”

Fight!
