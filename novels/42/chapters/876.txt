The test of the Dao!

Since the Dao Order had been established, no one had ever passed that test. Yet now, it had been overcome by a disciple of the Dao Order’s sword enemy.

At this moment, it wasn’t just the members of the Ancient Sword School who were shocked, even the members of the Dao Order were shocked.

Countless disciples of the Dao Order had suddenly appeared beneath the stairs, and just like the disciples of the sword school and all the other countless cultivators here, their gazes had descended onto Yang Ye.

Daoist Gu and 2 more Saint Realm experts were standing on Yang Ye’s sides while Fu Jinxian’s master, a grey robed old man, and a black robed old man stood before them.

Daoist Gu and the old men had solemn expressions on their faces, and they seemed vigilant as if they were facing a formidable enemy. On the other hand, the 3 from the Dao Order had gloomy expressions while they stared fixedly at Yang Ye.

The atmosphere here was quite tense and slightly heavy.

What did Yang Ye’s passage through the 5th test represent?

It represented that Yang Ye’s natural talent and strength might be the most terrifying throughout the Dao Order and only second to the founding ancestor of the Dao Order. In other words, if Yang Ye were to continue growing, then the Dao Order would definitely have a peerless expert as its enemy in the future.

Anyone with the slightest bit of wisdom would be aware that enemies, and especially enemies with extremely great potential should be killed before they could grow.

The Dao Order understood that principle, and so did the Ancient Sword School. So, Daoist Gu’s group seemed like they were facing a powerful enemy. Because it was very likely for the Dao Order to stop at nothing to kill Yang Ye!

Meanwhile, the black robed old man who led the group from the Dao Order suddenly gazed at Yang Ye, and there was a trace of complicated emotions in his eyes, “Why? Why do you just happen to be a disciple of the Ancient Sword School? Why did you have to be an irreconcilable enemy of my Dao Order? Forget it, it’s meaningless now.” When he spoke up to this point, the black robed old man waved his right hand.

“Forbidden Eradication Formation!” The black robed old man’s voice resounded through the sky.

Daoist Gu and the others’ expressions changed when they heard this, and Daoist Gu roared furiously, “Take him and go!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he flicked with his finger, and a huge sword tore through the sky and instantly arrived before the black robed old man. The black robed old man suddenly made a tearing motion towards the space before him, and he tore the huge sword into two. While the sword had shattered, endless threads of sword energy erupted from within it, and the sword energy instantly enveloped the black robed old man and the others.

Meanwhile, the other 2 old men immediately grabbed Yang Ye and were about to leave once Daoist Gu spoke. However, their expressions changed abruptly because a huge pitch black barrier of light had suddenly appeared around them. There was a dense expanse of strange symbols glowing on the pitch black barrier, and they were accompanied by all sorts of strange demon beasts as well!

The old men revealed extremely solemn expressions when they saw the pitch black barrier of light.

Meanwhile, the countenances of countless disciples of the Ancient Sword School and the spectating cultivators had turned ghastly pale because even an idiot knew what the Dao Order was planning.

While the Saints fight, the commoners suffer!

Bang!

Suddenly, a huge explosion resounded as the black robed old man was instantly blasted backwards by the threads of sword energy. However, the threads of sword energy didn’t vanish and returned to Daoist Gu instead.

“All of you won’t be able to escape!” As soon as the black robed old man finished speaking, 2 more old men appeared here, and they were Saints as well!

There were a total of 5 Saints on the Dao Order’s side!

Daoist Gu spoke solemnly, “Looks like your Dao Order intends to fight desperately!”

The black robed man pointed at Yang Ye and said, “He must die, even if your Ancient Sword School and my Dao Order must go to war!” Yang Ye’s talent had even aroused fear in the higher-ups of the entire Dao Order. If the Ancient Sword School were to foster him with its full strength, then Yang Ye would definitely become an existence who destroyed the balance between their sects in the future. At that time, it would be the time of the Dao Order’s destruction!

So, the higher-ups had unanimously decided that Yang Ye had to die!

Daoist Gu spoke solemnly, “Once our sects enter into war, both our sects will definitely suffer severe losses!”

“If he doesn’t die, then it might be my Dao Order that suffers severe losses in the future!” The black robed man continued, “I know that you’re trying to delay. But you should be aware that the Forbidden Eradication Formation was left behind by the founding ancestor of my Dao Order, and it can kill Saints. So, even Jian Wuchen wouldn’t be able to break through this formation in a short period of time.”

As he spoke, the 5 of them surrounded Daoist Gu and the others from all directions, and all of their gazes had descended onto Yang Ye. So long as the black robed old man gave the order, they would use their full strength to kill Yang Ye. Not to mention that Daoist Gu only had a total of 3 Saints on his side including himself, they couldn’t stop these 5 Saints from killing Yang Ye even if 3 more Saints came!

Right when they were about to attack, Yang Ye suddenly said, “Do you know what the 5th test was like?”

The black robed old man gazed at Yang Ye and asked, “What are you trying to say?”

Yang Ye grinned, “I encountered an old man. He said I was very pleasing to the eye, so he gave me something.” When he spoke up to this point, Yang Ye withdrew the spatial ring that the Dao Order’s founding ancestor had given him, and he said, “It’s this. Do all of you recognize it?”

The black robed old man and the others were stunned and filled with disbelief when they saw it.

“How could that be possible? How could that be possible? How could the Founding Ancestor have possibly given that ring to you? How could that be possible?” The black robed old man’s eyes were filled with shock and disbelief, and it was the same for the other 4 Saints from the Dao Order.

“So all of you know what it is!” Yang Ye grinned, “Can you tell me what it is? Because he didn’t tell me what it was when he gave it to me.”

The black robed old man suddenly made a gesture, and then black spatial ring flew into his grasp. He gazed at it for a short while before he took a deep breath, and then he flicked it back to Yang Ye, “What else did he tell you?”

Yang Ye smiled, “Nothing much. He just asked me to be the next sect master of the Dao Order.”

It wasn’t just the black robed old man and the others whose expressions changed upon hearing this, even the members of the Ancient Sword School had a similar reaction. Especially Daoist Gu’s group of 3. Their gazes descended onto Yang Ye as they wanted to see if Yang Ye was joking.

The black robed old man remained silent for a long time before he said, “What was your answer?”

“I refused, of course!” Yang Ye continued, “Because I told him that numerous people in the Dao Order want to kill me. So, wouldn’t I be leaping into a pit of flames by trying to be your next sect master?”

Daoist Gu and the others instantly heaved sighs of relief when they heard Yang Ye, and the black robed old man’s group heaved sighs of relief as well.

Yang Ye suddenly sighed, “That old geezer said that so long as I have this ring, then no one in the Dao Order would dare to act against me. But now it would see like he was just talking nonsense!”

“How dare you!” The black robed old man suddenly roared furiously. But he seemed to have thought of something and calmed himself, and then he tried his best to make his voice sound gentler as he said, “He’s the founding ancestor of my Dao Order, and he’s your.... In short, please be respectful towards him!”

Yang Ye laughed coldly and said, “Did I say something wrong? Looks like he was just exaggerating. So, it’s pointless to keep this ring anymore!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye casually tossed the ring away, and it dropped down from midair.

The expressions of the black robed old man and the others changed. The black robed old man stretched out his hand and gestured, and the ring instantly flew into his grasp. He gazed at Yang Ye and was clearly quite furious, but he didn’t flare-up, and he spoke in with a gentle expression on his face instead, “Since the Founding Ancestor gave it to you, then keep it well. Don’t worry, from this moment onwards, the enmity between you and my Dao Order is a matter of the past!”

“Really?” asked Yang Ye.

The black robed man quickly nodded, “Of course!”

Yang Ye said, “Alright, then I guess I have no choice but to keep it!” As he spoke, he stretched out his hand and the spatial ring instantly flew into his grasp.

The black robed old man and the others heaved slight sighs of relief when they witnessed this scene. Meanwhile, Yang Ye said, “Right, the old man told me one more thing.”

“What?” The black robed man and the others immediately revealed solemn expressions.

Yang Ye continued, “Nothing much. He just said that I can ask the Dao Order if I need anything. Right, I just happen to be quite poor. So, I’d like to borrow a million extreme-grade energy stones from you. Don’t worry, I guarantee to return it!”

The expressions of the black robed man and the others instantly became unsightly.

The beautiful woman spoke abruptly, “Kid! That’s enough!”

Yang Ye gazed at her and said, “Right, didn’t you say that you would give me your writing if I passed the 5th test? As a Saint Realm expert, you wouldn’t go back on your word, right?”

The corners of her mouth twitched slightly, and then she said, “How could I possibly do that? However, I don’t have the time to write for you right now. How about I write it for you if you’re still alive 10,000 years from now?”

Yang Ye gave her a thumbs up and said, “Nice!” As soon as he finished speaking, he gazed at the black robed old man and said, “Don’t tell me you don’t even have a million extreme-grade energy stones. Or perhaps that old man was lying? If that’s the case, then what’s the point of keeping this ring? I’ll give it back to you!” As soon as he finished speaking, he flicked it back to the black robed old man.

The corners of their mouths twitched incessantly. Quite some time passed before the black robed old man took a deep breath, and then he flicked the ring back to Yang Ye and said, “What are you talking about? Since the founding ancestor said that, then how could we possibly not obey him? There are a million extreme-grade energy stones in here, just take it as our gift to you. You don’t have to return it!”

If it was possible, he naturally hoped that Yang Ye would return it, but the problem was would Yang Ye do that? Would he? As far as the black robed old man was concerned, that shameless fellow who was using the name of their founding ancestor would absolutely not do that!

“How could I possibly just take it?” Yang Ye seemed rather troubled, and he ‘struggled’ for a long time before he said, “Alright. Since it’s an expression of your kind intentions, then I’ll take it.” As he spoke, he put the spatial ring away and said, “We’re leaving now!”

“Take care!” The expression on the black robed old man’s face was quite interesting as he spoke these words.

Yang Ye grinned, and he was about to turn around and leave. However, a voice suddenly resounded from afar, “You’re leaving just like that?”

“It’s the Protector of Order!” Someone exclaimed from amidst the crowd!
