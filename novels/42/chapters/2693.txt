Chapter 2694 – Drunk!

First God gazed at Tu for a long, long time. In the end, he shook his head slightly, “I don’t know you. Since you’re here for him, I’ll be leaving!”

He turned around and left.

He left swiftly!

Meanwhile, Tu frowned, “Didn’t I nail you on that cliff?”

At this moment, First God had left the Martial Sky World, but he still heard her.

He’d been recognized!

At this moment, his heart trembled!

He’d naturally recognized Tu!

It was the Destiny that had almost beaten him to death!

The Destiny who wielded Heaven Executor!

First God didn’t hesitate to tear space open and enter it.

However, as soon as he did, one of his arms was left behind, and a ray of sword energy pierced his chest.

But he’d still managed to flee! Of course, he wasn’t in very great condition right now! That attack may not have taken his life, but it had heavily injured him!

Martial Sky World.

Tu frowned slightly. Meanwhile, Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and asked, “Aren’t you going to chase after him?”

She gazed at Yang Ye, “Why should I? I’m here to beat you up!”

Yang Ye felt quite speechless, “Um… I’d like to know why!”

“Why?” She walked over to him, “What do you think?”

As she spoke, she suddenly punched him.

At the moment Tu swung a punch at him, Yang Ye waved his sword.

The sword was longer than the hand, and Yang Ye’s sword was aimed at her chest.

Yang Ye’s sword stabbed her chest, but it couldn’t stab into her chest. Meanwhile, her punch slammed against his stomach.

Bam!

Yang Ye was blasted all the way out of the tower.

But before he could even stop himself, Tu appeared in front of him again. This time, a sword appeared in Yang Ye’s left grasp!

Past Life and Great Unknown!

Tu frowned slightly upon seeing Great Unknown, “4th gave you her sword too. They’re really blind!”

She slammed her fist at his stomach.

This time, Yang Ye still didn’t choose to dodge it. He swung both his swords like a pair of scissors at her throat.

Meanwhile, Tu suddenly stopped her punch. She unfurled her fist and slapped them in both directions.

Bam! Bam!

Yang Ye’s swords were slapped off course, leaving him completely open, and so Tu used this to slam another punch at him.

This punch was impossible to dodge for Yang Ye!

Suddenly, Yang Ye released his swords and grabbed Tu’s shoulder. She frowned upon feeling him grab her, and then she shook her shoulders, shaking off his hands as well. After that, she unfurled her fist and clawed at Yang Ye. She clawed his stomach, and then she swung her hand upward as if she was lifting something up, causing Yang Ye’s entire figure to be launched upward!

A moment later, Tu stomped her right foot down and soared up into the air. At the same time, she kicked at Yang Ye’s stomach.

At this critical moment, two swords suddenly slashed down at her from both sides.

However, they were instantly blasted away by Heaven Executor!

A moment later, her foot struck Yang Ye’s stomach. At the same time, Yang Ye grabbed her leg with both hands. He endured the pain in his stomach as he howled with fury and spun himself to launch a kick at her head!

He had to fight even if he was no match for her!

That was what he was thinking!

He couldn’t just allow himself to get beaten up!

However, a hand grabbed his leg!

Tu’s hand!

She grabbed his leg and swung him away.Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Yang Ye was swung far away into outer space. A moment later, Tu vanished, and then a fist slammed down at Yang Ye!

Yang Ye closed his eyes slowly!

This punch felt as if it was full of flaws, yet they weren’t flaws. Or it should be said that she’d intentionally revealed them to him!

Yang Ye recalled his spar with the woman in black. It was how she’d fought him that day too!

Now that he recalled it, he knew that she’d been reminding him about it on purpose.

Yang Ye opened his eyes, and it slammed against his face. Yang Ye knew his face had warped.

But he grabbed her hand with both hands.

Hiss!

In an instant, countless strands of sword energy and sword intent swept out from him!

The Sword Domain Sphere!

At this moment, the Sword Domain Sphere wasn’t comparable to the past. It was much stronger because Yang Ye’s Sword Dao was much greater!

Yang Ye was trying to take her down with him!

It was the only thing he could do. Because he was no match for her in both combat instinct and technique.

Bam!

An explosion resounded, and then Yang Ye was blasted away again.

Tu glanced at herself, and there was a lot of sharp sword energy around her. However, the sword energy wasn’t able to harm her at all!

She looked up at Yang Ye. Meanwhile, Yang Ye had charged at her.

Tu was visibly surprised by this, and then she leaped up like a pouncing tiger and slapped her palm against his stomach. Yang Ye’s figure curled forward as it shot backward, but she suddenly grabbed his hand and threw him over her shoulder.

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

That wasn’t the end of it!

After that, Tu kicked Yang Ye on the butt, causing him to fly off into the distance in a very embarrassing posture!

But it didn’t take long for him to charge at her again.

However, he was always blasted away.

Tu’s skill with her fists and legs was absolutely terrifying!

But she didn’t try to kill him.

A short while later, Yang Ye appeared before Tu again, and he had a sword in each hand!

Madness Sword Technique!

However, his Madness Sword Technique didn’t work on her. She just stood there without taking a single step back, and Yang Ye couldn’t even hit her once.

Meanwhile, she suddenly grabbed Past Life with a single hand, and then moved it to the left and used it to block Great Unknown. Just like that, Tu started to use Past Life to fight Yang Ye.

A long time passed before Yang Ye stopped.

At this moment, both his swords were in her grasp.

He’d been completely crushed!

Tu gazed at Yang Ye for a long time and said, “You’re still lacking something. Your Sword Dao of emotion is lacking something. So, your Sword Dao isn’t strong enough. Of course, it’s quite strong for your age! At the very least, you’ve done quite well in terms of sword technique and everything else. Unfortunately, you must realize that your core is emotions. Strong emotions. Unfortunately, you don’t really understand what it means yet. Or perhaps, I should say that your emotions are only minor emotions, and so it is a Minor Dao.”

As she spoke, she tossed both the swords and took a gulp out of the gourd by her waist.

A short while later, she gazed at Yang Ye, “That sword cultivator said you have great potential, and he thinks you’ll be his greatest opponent in the future. Do you know what I think?”

Yang Ye ignored her.

His consciousness was slightly blurry from all the hits he’d sustained.

Tu continued, “Your sword is a sword of emotion, so if you want it to be stronger and reach the same level which that sword cultivator and I are at, then you must understand what true emotion is. Otherwise, you’ll always be nothing.”

She walked toward him as she spoke.

Meanwhile, Snowy appeared before Yang Ye.

She held the Sprite Staff in her left grasp while the five swords of the five elements were on her right. Besides them, there was Past Life and Great Unknown too! She’d brought all of them out here to help her in battle!

Snowy watched Tu with vigilance and refused to let her get closer!

Tu glanced at Snowy, “When did you become like a cute pet?”

Snowy blinked. She was saying that she didn’t know what Tu was saying.

Tu sized up Snowy, “Tsk, tsk. You were a ruthless figure once, yet you’re like this now… Interesting, truly interesting. And you’re actually with that horned fellow. Don’t you two fight?”

Snowy stretched out two of her claws. Snowy was asking if she was speaking about Erya!

Tu glanced at Yang Ye’s stomach, “Isn’t she right there? Anyway, even she has become like that… Both of you are the most good and evil existences in the world, yet you’re actually together. Both of you… Ugh!”

Snowy glared at her with displeasure, and then she pointed at Yang Ye’s stomach and started waving her paws swiftly.

Tu frowned slightly, “What the heck are you saying?”

Meanwhile, Snowy pointed the Sprite Staff at her to tell her not to come any closer!

Tu gazed at Snowy for a long time. In the end, she shook her head and sighed, “To be honest, while your actions were a little extreme, the humans and the other races did go too far as well. Don’t blame the strongest among us, if she didn’t deal with you, you would have annihilated countless living beings in the Three Dimensional Universe.”

She raised the gourd at Snowy, “This is in honor of your past, the past you who dared to howl at our strongest and ask who the heck she thinks she is.”

She took a large gulp of the wine.

Snowy blinked. She pointed at the gourd and pointed at herself.

She was asking if she could drink some.

Tu roared with laughter, and then she tossed the gourd at Snowy.

Snowy took the gourd, but the swords around her started trembling madly.

Tu suddenly said, “Put the swords away! That gourd will harm them!”

Snowy nodded while seeming to understand, and then she put the swords away before taking a huge gulp just like Tu had done.

After she finished drinking, Snowy blinked, and then her head tilted to the side before she fell directly on Yang Ye’s shoulder.

Her entire face was red like a peach.

She was drunk!
