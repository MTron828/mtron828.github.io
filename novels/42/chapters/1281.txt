Chapter 1282 – See You! No! I Hope We Never Meet Again!

She can’t stand the sight of me?! Yang Ye was stunned for quite a while before he recovered from his shock and said, “Why?”

Qian Lankong spoke indifferently, “There’s no reason. In short, I won’t join your Sword Alliance. Return my soul once you’ve recovered, and then we’ll go on our separate paths.”

“Do you not want to leave this place?” asked Yang Ye. He was slightly reluctant to give up.

“No one doesn’t want to leave.” Qian Lankong continued, “I believe that you have a very good chance to leave this place.”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Then why aren’t you willing to join the Sword Alliance?”

She glanced indifferently at him and said, “I don’t want to become the sword in another’s hand again, and I don’t want to obey the orders of others anymore. Now, I just want to live for myself. Understand?”

Yang Ye fell silent. He felt that this was probably the reason why she refused to join the Sword Alliance. It made sense because no one was willing to become the sword in another’s hand. She’d obeyed the Slayer Pavilion’s master and been his sword for the sake of taking revenge. Yet now, she’d gotten her revenge, so she clearly didn’t want to go on living a life where she had to obey the orders of another.

When he thought up to this point, Yang Ye nodded, “I understand.”

Qian Lankong didn’t speak further, and she just picked up another violet crystal and brought it to Yang Ye’s mouth. Suddenly, both their expressions changed because the space above them was suddenly torn open, and then a palm emerged from within it. In the end, that palm slammed down in their direction!

Qian Lankong’s eyes narrowed slightly. The dagger in her hand transformed into a ray of white light that shot up into the sky. It was extremely swift and instantly collided with the palm.

Bang!

A rumbling explosion resounded, and then countless waves of energy swept towards the surroundings, causing space to ripple incessantly.

“Let’s go!” Qian Lankong pulled Yang Ye up and placed him on her back before she vanished on the spot.

“Where do you think you’re going?!” A voice resounded from where Yang Ye and Qian Lankong had just vanished, and then an emaciated hand suddenly emerged from the spatial rift and grabbed at them. The palm carried an extremely powerful suction force that caused both Yang Ye and Qian Lankong to instantly slow down.

A wisp of ferocity flashed through Qian Lankong’s eyes. She twisted her palm slightly, causing the spacer behind her to warp, and the suction force instantly vanished. Meanwhile, she seized the opportunity to enter the space before her.

They’d just vanished when a grey robed old man appeared here, and then Ye Ming and the others arrived just a little while later.

Ye Ming asked in a low voice, “Was that the female assassin from the Slayer Pavilion?”

Senior Yuan’s eyes narrowed slightly, “Yang Ye is heavily injured, and she’s protecting him.”

“How could that be possible?!” Ye Ming was shocked, “How could she possibly be with Yang Ye? Could it be that Yang Ye and the master of Slayer Pavilion came to some sort of agreement? The Slayer Pavilion is siding with Yang Ye?”

The others’ expressions changed when they heard this. Because it would be a problem if the Slayer Pavilion had sided with Yang Ye. Yang Ye himself was extremely terrifying, and if the Slayer Pavilion assisted Yang Ye from the shadows, then not to mention killing Yang Ye, even their own survival would be a problem. After all, while they had the numbers, the Slayer Pavilion wouldn’t fight them head-on. The Slayer Pavilion would catch them off guard and assassinate them!

All of them gazed at Senior Yuan.

Senior Yuan spoke solemnly, “This incident is quite strange. The Slayer Pavilion is an organization that upholds certain principles, so it wouldn’t change sides easily. In short, let’s ignore that for now and pursue them. If that woman continues to protect Yang Ye, then we’ll kill her as well!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Senior Yuan’s figure vanished on the spot.

The others hurriedly followed after him.

Over 100,000km away, Qian Lankong was dashing madly with Yang Ye on her back.

Even though Yang Ye had some profound energy within him now, it wasn’t enough. Because the injuries he’d suffered were truly too heavy. It could be said that his entire body was covered in injuries, and there wasn’t a single part of him that remained whole. Including the insides of his body. These injuries required at least 40 or 50% of his profound energy to heal, but it would take at least 4 to 6 hours to recover that much profound energy. Yet now, the thing he lacked the most was time!

Qian Lankong suddenly said, “Are you very happy now?”

Yang Ye asked, “What do you mean?”

She replied, “They noticed us together, and I even saved you. Now, they’ll definitely think that we’re on the same side. You’ve succeeded at dragging me down, so shouldn’t you be happy?”

“If we’re on the same side, then we are!” Yang Ye continued, “Miss Qian, don’t worry. I’ll join forces with you and annihilate them once I’ve healed!”

“Shut your mouth!” Qian Lankong roared with fury, “Yang Ye, don’t even dream of making me work for you. In any case, no matter what state you’re in after a day, you have to return my soul. Otherwise, we can just die together. If you think I dare not do that, then you can try me.”

Yang Ye sighed softly, “Miss Qian, I don’t want you to work for me. I just think that since they’ve considered you to be their enemy, it’s beneficial for us to work together against them. Right?”

She grunted coldly, “It’s beneficial to me? Leave this world? How laughable! Leaving this world is just a pie you’re drawn out for us to see. It can be seen but can’t be eaten, yet we have to work ourselves to the bone for you while waiting. We have to kill for you and obey your orders. What a great plan!” Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Yang Ye fell silent for a short while before he said, “How about we do it in another way? We can still work together. Help me and raise your conditions for doing so. Alright?”

“No!” She continued, “As I’ve said before, we’ll go our separate ways after the day passes.”

Yang Ye remained silent for a long time before he nodded, “Since you’ve made your decision, then I won’t speak further.”

“You should have done that from the beginning!” She grunted coldly and sped up.

Yang Ye didn’t waste his breath anymore. He withdrew violet crystals and continued swallowing them. Presently, the important matter at hand for him was to recover as soon as possible.

Yang Ye suddenly asked, “Why have they been able to locate us?” Even though he hadn’t concealed his aura with the Sword Domain, Qian Lankong had used the Laws of Space to isolate their auras. Logically speaking, they shouldn’t have been found. Because Qian Lankong’s ability to isolate aura was extremely formidable. After all, he wouldn’t have been able to locate her without the Sword Domain.

“Don’t look down on anyone. Especially those from the Veiled Region!” Qian Lankong spoke solemnly, “That Old Man Yuan as well. He’s a true living fossil, so he naturally has a huge number of abilities. Moreover, there are 7 of them, and all of them are Voiders. So long as they will it, they can cover a massive area within their divine sense. We just have to make a slight mistake, and they might find us right away. Not to mention that the previous battle caused quite a commotion.”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and said, “Right, so do you have any plans now?”

Qian Lankong, “I’ll just flee with you until tomorrow, and then you and I will flee on our own!”

Yang Ye was speechless.

She hadn’t been lying. She really did flee incessantly with Yang Ye on her back. Obviously, she really intended to go her separate ways with Yang Ye once their agreement was over.

Yang Ye shook his head and didn’t say anything. A forced cooperation didn’t last. Since she really didn’t want to cooperate with him, then it was pointless to continue speaking.

Qian Lankong dashed madly with Yang Ye on her back. Even though her ability in concealment was good, she’d almost been stopped by Senior Yuan’s group on many occasions. Fortunately, they got out of it without being dragged into any battle.

Yang Ye’s injuries were healing rapidly. At this point, he’d recovered by almost 40%. However, there was no profound energy within him because he’d used all his profound energy to recover. So, he was still being carried by Qian Lankong. It couldn’t be helped; his speed was much inferior when compared to her.

After another 10 hours passed, Yang Ye’s injuries were almost completely healed. Now, he was mainly recovering his profound energy. Because he’d used all his profound energy to heal his injuries, so there wasn’t a drop of profound energy left within him.

Qian Lankong spoke solemnly, “They are getting closer!”

Yang Ye replied, “2 hours. Give me 2 hours!”

Qian Lankong fell silent for a short while before she said, “Your injuries are healed?”

Yang Ye didn’t conceal it and said, “Almost.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he clearly sensed her delicate figure tremble. A short while passed before she asked, “Do you possess the undying physique of legend?”

“No!” Yang Ye continued, “My profound energy is just special, and that’s why I heal so quickly.”

Qian Lankong nodded slightly, “So that’s why!”

They didn’t speak further. Just like that, 2 hours passed, and Qian Lankong stopped. Yang Ye was very self-aware. His figure flashed and appeared in front of her.

Qian Lankong gazed silently at Yang Ye.

Yang Ye didn’t say anything unnecessary. He just waves his right hand and 2 strands of soul appeared before Qian Lankong. She couldn’t help but glance at him when she saw him return her soul so readily. But she didn’t say anything. She just waved her hand, and the 2 strands of her soul instantly entered her body. Qian Lankong immediately seemed even more spirited.

She took a deep breath before she gazed at Yang Ye, “See you. No, I hope we never meet again!”

As soon as she finished speaking, she didn’t stay a moment longer and immediately vanished on the spot.

Yang Ye shrugged. Suddenly, he turned to look towards the distance, and then he pondered deeply for a moment before vanishing on the spot.

Yang Ye had just vanished on the spot when a ray of light flashed through where he’d been standing, and then another 5 rays of light flashed through successively.

A little while later, Yang Ye appeared there once more. Now, he didn’t just have the Laws of Space, he had the Sword Domain as well. So, the combined concealment effect of them made even Qian Lankong’s ability in concealment to be inferior to him. So, those experts from the Veiled Region hadn’t noticed him.

Yang Ye looked up towards the distance, and then he frowned. Because they were heading in the direction that Qian Lankong had vanished towards.

He hesitated for a moment before following soundlessly behind them.
