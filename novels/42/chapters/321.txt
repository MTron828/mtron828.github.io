Chapter 322 – A Ticket To Hell!

The Nether God’s Tomb wasn’t below ground, and it was on the surface instead. The tomb was extremely enormous and occupied an area of thousands of kilometers. Instead of calling it a tomb, one could call it a small city!

When Yang Ye and Xiao Yuxi arrived here, it was filled with an ocean of people. Humans were the most numerous here, and there were over 10,000 of them, whereas, the remaining were from the nether territory, devil territory, and demon territory. The Nether God’s Tomb didn’t just possess Souls that could be utilized to improve one’s own soul, the treasures that the Nether God had left behind were here as well. So, how could they not be tempted by all of this?

Yang Ye was surprised because he didn’t see Hun You and Mo Ke. Moreover, the three outstanding geniuses of the central territory weren’t here as well!

Yang Ye shook his head and shot his gaze towards the entrance to the tomb because there was a 300m tall tombstone there, and there were a few huge words written on it — The times would be dark without the Martial God!

Yang Ye asked Xiao Yuxi as he gazed at the tombstone. “What does that mean!?”

Xiao Yuxi glanced at it and said, “It means that if the Martial God doesn’t appear in the world, then the world would belong to the Nether God. Why would there be such words here? Because the Nether God was killed by the Martial God of that age!”

“The Martial God of that age?” Yang Ye frowned. He thought of Yuan Tong when he heard the words Martial God. Yuan Tong was once called the Quasi Martial God. However, it was a matter of the past, and Yang Ye didn’t know how Yuan Tong was now!

Xiao Yuxi nodded, and she revealed reverence in her eyes as she said, “The Martial God of that age was truly matchless in the world and a true genius. Because that Martial God had comprehended 13 Intents, and he’d cultivated every single one of them to their limits! So, even the Nether God who’d attained the Saint Realm and possessed a practically undying body and soul had still died at his hands!”

“13 Intents!” Yang Ye was shocked and said, “He was that outstanding?”

“How could he be called the Martial God if he wasn’t?” Xiao Yuxi said, “Since time immemorial, the world would submit before the Martial God! Right, there was an exception, and it was during the age of the Founding Ancestor of the southern territory’s Sword Sect. The Martial God of that age lost to him. Besides that, so long as a Martial God emerged into the world, then the Martial God would reign supreme throughout the world!”

“The Sword Sect’s Founding Ancestor....” Yang Ye felt silent. It wasn’t the first time he’d heard about the Sword Sect’s Founding Ancestor. How outstanding was he? Countless people still feel reverence towards him even after 10,000 years have passed? After all, even someone as formidable as Elder Mu had revealed a trace of reverence when he spoke about the Sword Sect’s Ancestor!

“He’s like a God in the heart of all Sword Cultivators in the world!” Xiao Yuxi said, “Because he defeated the Martial God of that age. After all, the Sword Emperors before him had practically always lost in the battle between the Sword Emperors and their ‘natural enemies’, the Martial Gods!”

Yang Ye smiled and said, “Invincible throughout the world in life and renowned through the ages in death. Haha! That’s exactly how men should be like!”

Xiao Yuxi glanced at Yang Ye, and then she fell silent.

Time slowly flowed by and an hour passed just like that. When the last strand of sunlight west had vanished from the world, the sky had suddenly darkened. After that, a strand of cold wind appeared out of thin air, and it caused the expressions of everyone in the surroundings to change.

Subsequently, the ground started to split up slowly before countless strands of black gas seeped out from the ground!

“Watch out, it’s Death Energy that can destroy vitality. Don’t allow it to come into contact with your bodies!” Someone suddenly shouted. In an instant, everyone besides the group from the nether territory had hurriedly started evading the black gas, and they didn’t dare allow it to come into contact with their bodies.

However, because there was truly too much of it, there were still countless people whose bodies were invaded by the black gas. In an instant, all of them who came into contact with the black gas had been instantly transformed into dry corpses!

“Ah! Profound energy is useless against it! Save me! AHHH!! SAVE ME!!!”

“I’m not going in there anymore! I’m not going in! AHHH!”

“Save me....”

Countless shouts resounded throughout the surroundings.

Yang Ye frowned when he witnessed this scene, and then he flicked with his finger, causing a strand of sword qi to shoot forward explosively and blast the strand of black gas in front of him into powder. After that, he said, “What exactly is this? Why is profound energy useless against it?” He’d seen this black gas in the past because Luo Xue had utilized it to injure him in the past! If he didn’t have the tiny vortex, then he would have probably become a dried corpse at that time! So, Yang Ye felt a wave of fear when he recalled that event!

“It’s Death Energy!” Xiao Yuxi’s eyes carried a wisp of a solemn expression, and she said, “It’s a type of energy that’s formed naturally from the spirit, energy, and essence of the body after a person dies and the person’s soul dissipates. This Death Energy can destroy the vitality of one’s body, so you absolutely must not allow it to come into contact with you. Otherwise, it will be very troublesome to deal with!”

Yang Ye nodded. Suddenly, he raised his head and looked towards the distance. He saw that the members of the nether territory were actually moving about and absorbing the Death Energy that others shuddered in fear from just hearing about!

Yang Ye spoke with an astounded expression. “Why can they do that?”

“Because there’s no vitality in their bodies at all!” Xiao Yuxi said in a low voice, “The Death Energy is extremely harmful towards us, but it’s just like the souls here and is greatly beneficial to them. Remember that the nether race can’t be compared to the demon race and devil race. They’re too mysterious, so you must be careful when you fight them in the future!”

Yang Ye nodded. The nether race’s method of attack was extremely strange indeed. It was impossible to take precautions against, so he had to be careful and couldn’t be careless at all!

The members of the nether territory slowly stopped solely absorbing the Death Energy, they even started acting against the human profounders! Because these human profounders were afraid of the Death Energy, they couldn’t fight fearlessly like the fellows from the nether territory could. So, a few hundred human profounders had died at the hands of the nether race in less than 15 minutes.

Moreover, the members of the devil race had started to attack the human profounders as well. So, more and more humans were perishing under the join forces of the nether race and devil race.

A slaughter had begun!

Xiao Yuxi frowned when she witnessed this scene, and she tightened her grip on her saber. She seemed to be slightly unable to continue watching. On the other hand, Yang Ye’s expression was calm as if he hadn’t noticed it at all!

“Do you know?” Yang Ye suddenly said, “I’d once stood below Ancient Domain City and invited them to annihilate all those fellows of the devil race, demon race, and nether race with me. If they weren’t so selfish at that time, then we could have annihilated all of these fellows! Unfortunately, not a single person came down from the city wall. So, whose fault is it that they’re being killed now?”

Xiao Yuxi sighed lightly, and then she relaxed her grip on her saber. Perhaps she could save them this time, but what about next time? Since these human profounders dared to come to the Ancient Battlefield and dared to come here to the Ninth Hell, then they should be mentally prepared for death!

Xiao Yuxi shook her head lightly and said, “Let’s enter the tomb!”

Yang Ye suddenly asked. “Why haven’t Hun You, Mo Ke, and the others come here?”

“It’s not that they didn’t come but that they’ve already gone in!” Xiao Yuxi said, “This isn’t the only entrance to the Nether God’s Tomb!”

“There are other ways to get in?” Yang Ye was astounded.

Xiao Yuxi nodded and said, “Of course. After all, this tomb was jointly built by the nether race and human race, later on. So, they naturally have their own ways to enter it. Alright, let’s go in as well. They’d probably entered the inner crypt by now!” Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

As soon as she finished speaking, Xiao Yuxi tapped the ground lightly with the tip of her foot, and then she instantly shot explosively towards the entrance.

When he saw this, Yang Ye stopped hesitating and intended to enter the tomb as well. Right at this moment, a black shadow suddenly appeared in front of him, so Yang Ye didn’t give it any thought before he drew his sword and slashed.

The black shadow hurriedly cried out. “It’s me! Leng Jun!”

Yang Ye’s hand stopped when he heard this, and then he gazed carefully at the black shadow. Sure enough, this black shadow was Leng Jun who’d returned to the southern territory to gather the assassins!

“It’s you!” Yang Ye said with displeasure, “Why do you move so soundlessly!”

Leng Jun rolled his eyes. Big Brother, I’m an assassin! If I don’t move soundlessly, then could it be that I should swagger about and make a grand entrance?

Leng Jun’s heart shook when he recalled Yang Ye’s attack that was swift like a bolt of lightning because he felt that Yang Ye’s strength had increased again. Moreover, it wasn’t by a little, but by a huge amount! Because he felt an extremely huge amount of pressure just now!

“You’ve brought them over?” asked Yang Ye.

Leng Jun nodded and said, “This place is too chaotic. Come with me!” As soon as he finished speaking, his figure flashed and vanished on the spot.

Yang Ye hurriedly followed Leng Jun when he saw this.

15 minutes later, Leng Jun suddenly stopped within a dense forest, and then he turned around to gaze at Yang Ye who was behind him and said, “It’s here!” As soon as he finished speaking, he clapped lightly, and then almost 200 black figures suddenly appeared here in an instant.

“I’ve brought over everyone that I could get to. There are 72 King Realm assassins amongst them, and the rest are at the First Heaven Realm. However, even though they are at the First Heaven Realm, every single one of them has taken the life of King Realm experts,” said Leng Jun.

Yang Ye nodded. Right when Yang Ye was about to speak, a black figure had stepped forward and glanced at Yang Ye before he said, “You can remove the poison for us?”

“Yes!” Yang Ye said, “But all of you should be aware of the conditions!”

“I’ve told them about it!” said Leng Jun.

“I don’t believe you!” The black figure suddenly said, “Even an Exalt Realm expert is helpless against that poison. How could a mere King Realm profounder like you be able to cure us of the poison!?”

“I don’t believe you as well!” Meanwhile, another black figure stepped forward and said, “Xue Yu makes sense. How could he be able to accomplish something that even an Exalt Realm expert can’t accomplish?”

“I don’t believe him as well....”

In next to no time, over 10 black figures had stepped forward.

“Xue Yu, are all of you suspecting that I deceived all of you?” Meanwhile, Leng Jun said in a low voice, “Besides that, since all of you didn’t believe me, then why did you follow me here!?”

“Leng Jun, we followed you here because we thought you’d gotten to know an extraordinary expert. However, we never expected that it would be a mere King Realm profounder! Hmph! It looks to me like dealing with the poison is a lie, and only working out selves to death for him is the truth behind all of this, right!?” said Xue Yu in a low voice.

Leng Jun intended to say something but Yang Ye had waved his hand to stop Leng Jun, and then he said, “Since all of you don’t believe me, then leave!”

There was nothing wrong with him, so why would he beg them to let him remove the poison within them?

“Leave?” Xue Yu grunted coldly and said, “How could it be so simple. We traveled a huge distance to come here, yet you intend to send us off just like that? How could it be that simple!?”

Yang Ye nodded and said, “Since it’s like that, then I’ll give all of you something!”

“What?”

“A ticket to hell!”
