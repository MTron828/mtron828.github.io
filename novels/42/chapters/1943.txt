Chapter 1944 – I Have Help Too!

Sage Protection could only be used once!

However, Snowy didn’t know that, and both Gu Ya and the old man weren’t aware either. Just like that, a Hear Dao Realm expert and a 3rd stage Enlightened Realm expert were being forced backwards repeatedly by Snowy.

They didn’t know that, but Yang Ye was aware.

Yang Ye went over to Snowy and said, “Snowy, don’t kill more!”

Snowy gazed at Yang Ye and was puzzled.

Yang Ye spoke seriously, “You’re a good child, so you shouldn’t kill too much. Understand?”

Snowy blinked and displayed that she didn’t understand him.

Yang Ye added, “The heavens are benevolent. It was alright to kill that other fellow because he wanted to kill me, but now…” Yang Ye pointed at Gu Ya and the old man, “They didn’t attack me just now, so you can spare them. Understand?”

Snowy glanced at Gu Ya and the old man. Their expressions changed again when they saw Snowy gaze at them, and their eyes were filled with fear.

It wasn’t a problem with their mentality, and it was because the strength Snowy revealed had been truly too terrifying!

She’d instantly annihilated a Dao Realm expert!

It was heaven defying!

Suddenly, Yang Ye gazed at Gu Ya, “Gu Ya, go back and tell your sect master that I’ll definitely pay a visit to the Oblivion Sect. Wait for me!”

Gu Ya glanced at Yang Ye and Snowy, and then Snowy immediately waved her little paw. Gu Ya and the old man’s eyelids twitched from the sight of this, and they became vigilant.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly embraced Snowy, “Don’t kill more. You’re a Sprite Lord, killing more is bad for you, so don’t kill so much. Understand?”

Snowy blinked while lightly placing her paw on his forehead. She was asking if he was alright!

Yang Ye ignored her and gazed at Gu Ya instead. He spoke fiercely, “What are you still standing there for?”

Gu Ya glanced at Snowy and gazed at Yang Ye, “Until next time!”

He vanished on the spot with the old man.

Yang Ye heaved a sigh of relief when he saw them leave. After all, the old man had been a Dao Realm expert!

If the old man attacked, he would definitely be in a worrying situation!

Once Gu Ya’s group left, Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings and was about to leave with Snowy. But his face suddenly fell.

Because the space in front of him had started to tremble, and then a voice came from there, “Sage Protection… Tsk, tsk. What a blessed little fellow!”

As soon as the voice finished resounding, a middle aged man appeared.

The middle aged man’s aura was much stronger than Elder Mo and the other old man from before.

It was extremely strong!

At the very least, he was a Know Dao Realm expert like Yin Hou!

Yang Ye’s face was extremely gloomy.

The middle aged man gazed at Snowy, “A Sprite Lord. No wonder it received the protection of a Sage!” He gazed at Yang Ye and continued, “I didn’t expect a Sprite Lord to actually be willing to stay with you! How surprising!”

Yang Ye patted Snowy on the head, “Go inside and play, alright?”

Snowy pointed at the middle aged man and pointed at herself.

She was clearly telling him that she would deal with the man!

Yang Ye chuckled and said, “I’ll do it. Be good!”

Snowy cracked a smile and flashed into the Primordial Pagoda.

Only Yang Ye and the middle aged man remained.

Meanwhile, the middle aged man glanced at the surroundings, “Since you’re all here, why don’t you show yourselves?”

“Fine!” A hearty voice resounded from Yang Ye’s left, and then a robust man appeared there.

The man had a curly beard and a single arm.

At the same time, a green robed middle aged man suddenly appeared on Yang Ye’s right. The man didn’t just wear green clothes, even his hair was green. Besides that, his eyes were a strange shade of emerald too!

“One of the human race’s four adepts, Xie Xian; one of the barbarian race’s ten generals, Yan Ba; an elder of the spirit race… Tsk, tsk. So many renowned figures in this universe are here!”

Suddenly, delicate laughter came from behind Yang Ye.

A beautiful woman and a middle aged man had appeared there. Yang Ye recognized them, they were the demon race’s Kuang Shi and the woman from the devil race whom he’d met in the Endless Ocean.

The human middle aged man, Xie Xian, smiled, “The human race, devil race, barbarian race, spirit race, demon race…”

He suddenly looked towards the side, “Which race are you from?”

A moment of silence ensued, and then the space there trembled before an old man walked out slowly. The old man was thin, wrinkled, and had yellowing skin. His figure was unusually thin like he’d been starving for a long time.

The old man glanced at Xie Xian and said, “A race that doesn’t have a reputation. It’s nothing worth mentioning!”

Xie Xian glanced at the old man, and then he looked up, “My friend from the sky race, aren’t you going to show yourself?”

Three breaths of time later, a middle aged man wearing white armor appeared there!

Xie Xiang grinned and gazed at Yang Ye, “There should be no more now!”

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings. All of them were Dao Realm experts, and they were even at the Know Dao Realm!

All of them were at the Know Dao Realm!

Not to mention all of them, he couldn’t even deal with one of them!

Yang Ye smiled, “All of you really think highly of me!”

“Think highly of you?” Xie Xian shook his head slightly, “While you’re an extraordinary genius, you’re not strong enough to make so many of us come to kill you. The holy sword. The Sovereign of Man somehow lost it, and it fell into your hands. As far as all the races are concerned, it’s a sword of utmost importance, and no mishaps can be allowed to occur!”

The holy sword!

Yang Ye looked down at the sword in his grasp and smiled, “Since I obtained you, I’ve never had an end to trouble!” Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

The holy sword trembled lightly and seemed to be saying something.

Yang Ye grinned, “I’m not blaming you. This is my choice. While you’ve brought countless troubles to me, you’ve helped me tremendously as well!”

As he spoke, he looked up at Xie Xian, “I’m quite curious. If this sword is so important, why doesn’t the Sovereign of Man come and get it himself?”

“I’ll answer you!” Suddenly, the woman from the devil race who stood behind Yang Ye smiled, “Because the Sovereign of Man doesn’t dare to do it himself!”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Why?”

The woman smiled, “Because if he leaves the Central Prefecture, he may suffer a joint attack from the experts of the shaman race or some other race. Now, no race will allow that sword to return to the human race’s possession!”

Yang Ye gazed at her, “I still don’t really understand!”

She smiled, “The human race’s ambition is huge. Even though they aren’t the strongest amongst the races, their ambition is definitely the greatest. That holy sword can break through all barriers, so they hold the initiative to start a war. Thus, we don’t want the human race to have that initiative, we want it for ourselves. Understand?”

“Would your devil race’s Devil Sovereign dare to come?” Meanwhile, Xie Xian suddenly said, “Would he dare?”

He gazed at Yang Ye and continued, “The Sovereign of Man didn’t come himself because if he does, then we wouldn’t be the people around you at this moment, and it would be those who make the decisions in the large universe. That’s why the leaders of the various races aren’t here. Because as far as they’re concerned, the entire large universe is about to enter into a state of chaos!”

Yang Ye smiled, “There’s only one sword, but there are so many of you here. It doesn’t seem to be enough to be shared amongst you!”

Xie Xian nodded slightly and glanced at the surroundings, “While he’s trying to drive a wedge between us, it does make sense. Everyone, it belongs to my human race, so it should be returned to us. Coming to take it isn’t really…”

“Xie Xian, cut the crap!” The robust bearded man from the barbarian race, Yan Ba, suddenly interrupted, “It does belong to the human race, but that was in the past. Now, it may belong to any one of us. Simply speaking, it’ll belong to the strongest. What do all of you think?”

“I think it makes absolute sense!” Yang Ye suddenly said, “The strongest gets the sword. All of you, please feel free to fight first. Once you’re done, I’ll give this sword to the winner! I’m serious!”

All of them gazed at him with quite a strange expression on their faces.

Meanwhile, delicate laughter resounded. The woman from the devil race gazed at Yang Ye and smiled, “What a great plan. You want us to kill each other, and then you take advantage of the situation. However, while it’s a good plan, reality is cruel. Because the first we kill when fighting for the sword will be you!”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

Meanwhile, Xie Xian gazed at Yang Ye, “You could have become a pillar of my human race. Unfortunately, you willingly allowed yourself to fall. Not only have you cultivated the techniques of the shaman race, you’ve even merged with their bloodline. A pity, truly a pity!”

He glanced at the others and continued, “Everyone, let’s put the ownership of the sword aside for now. Let’s kill him first before discussing that, alright?”

“I have no objections!” The woman from the devil race smiled, “But who’ll make the first move?”

Xie Xian replied, “How about we attack together?”

Everyone here nodded slightly to display they had no objections.

At this moment, everyone gazed at Yang Ye.

Xie Xian suddenly said, “You can choose to take your own life!”

Take my own life? Yang Ye chuckled and said, “Actually, I have help.”

“Is that so?” Xie Xian spoke indifferently, “Why don’t you call your help?”

Yang Ye looked Xie Xian in the eyes, “Are you sure?”

“I am!” Xie Xian nodded slightly, “Let me see who can save your life!”

Yang Ye smiled, “Since all of you want to see it, then I’ll do it!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he flipped his palm, and something appeared there.
