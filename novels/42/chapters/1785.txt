Chapter 1786 – The Five Clans’ Worries!

It didn’t take long for Su Mu to appear before Yang Ye.

Su Mu glanced at Yang Ye. At this moment, Yang Ye’s eyes were bloodshot, and he had an insane expression on his face. It was obvious that he didn’t look normal.

Su Mu pondered deeply for a moment and said, “Congratulations!”

Yang Ye gazed at Su Mu with a hostile gaze, and there was undisguised killing intent in it.

Su Mu seemed to have expected this and remained calm, “Do you plan to go back on your word?”

Yang Ye gazed at Su Mu for a long time before he smiled, “I’m not a person like that. Alright, from today onwards, I’ll let bygones be bygones.”

He turned around and walked away.

Suddenly, two women appeared in front of him. It was Lin Weiyang and Ling Xiu!

Yang Ye placed his hands behind his back and gazed at them with indifference.

Lin Weiyang suddenly walked over to Yang Ye, looked him in the eyes, and said, “I sense your heartbeat is very quick. Why is that?”

Yang Ye took a deep forward. They were just a palm’s breadth away from each other. They could clearly smell each other at this point. Yang Ye gazed at her while a smile curled up on the corners of his mouth, “That’s none of your business!”

As soon as he finished speaking, the atmosphere here became tense.

Ling Weiyang’s gaze became icy cold.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly took a step back and shrugged, “What? You want to fight me? Come! Do it! I wouldn’t be going back on my word if you make the first move!”

Attack? Lin Weiyang grinned, “My Secret Sect doesn’t go back on its word. So, please go ahead!”

Yang Ye chuckled, glanced at them, and asked, “Are you really not going to attack? Won’t you regret it?”

Lin Weiyang asked, “Do you want us to attack you that much?”

Yang Ye took a step forward and said, “To be honest, I really do. However, I don’t have time to waste on all of you.”

His figure flashed and vanished on the spot.

Once Yang Ye left, a moment of silence ensued, and then Ling Xiu suddenly said, “I feel like something isn’t right!”

Lin Weiyang slowly clenched her fists, and then she gazed at the direction Yang Ye left towards. She slowly relaxed her fists while an arc curled up on the corners of her mouth, “Interesting!”

…

After he left the core of the mountain, cold sweat appeared on Yang Ye’s forehead.

He had been quite worried earlier. Because he wasn’t that mysterious head. If they noticed that, it was very likely that they would attack him. But his current strength was utterly insufficient to fight them!

Fortunately, they seemed to have not noticed!

Yang Ye didn’t stay in the Secret Sect. He left it as quickly as possible.

Outside the Secret Sect, Yang Ye turned around and glanced at the boundless mountain range. He knew that this wasn’t the end of this.

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts, turned around, and left. But he hadn’t gone far before a few old men appeared before him.

All of them were 4th stage True Realm experts!

They were quite familiar to Yang Ye, and it didn’t take him long to recall their identities. One of them was from the Ying Clan, and the others should be from the Wang and Lu Clans.

Yang Ye glanced at them and laughed coldly in his heart. They really haven’t given up on killing me!

“Yang Ye!” Meanwhile, the old man who led the group laughed coldly, “You really were in the Secret Sect. We thought you would leave.”

Yang Ye started walking slowly in their direction, “And?”

“And?” The old man chuckled, “We’ve been waiting for so long. Fortunately, you’re finally here. So, today will be….”

Suddenly, the old man stopped talking.

Because his body had stiffened, and then his throat split open. A moment later, a strand of blood sprayed out from there before his head tilted to the side and fell off his body!

The others were shocked by this!

They immediately gazed at Yang Ye, but Yang Ye was still walking. This horrified them.

Because they knew that it had definitely been Yang Ye, but they actually hadn’t even been able to see how he did it.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye gazed at one of the old men. That old man’s expression changed drastically and intended to retreat. But his eyes suddenly opened wide, and disbelief filled them.

A moment later, his throat split open, and the gap grew larger and larger. In the end, his head fell off his body.

Pu!

Blood sprayed out like a fountain!

The last two experts were stunned by this scene, and they turned around and fled.

Flee!Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

At this moment, the last bits of their mental defenses had crumbled completely.

But they weren’t able to even go 300m away before a ray of light flashed by. A moment later, a head flew up into the air around 300m away. After that, another ray of light flashed, and the other expert’s head flew into the air!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye had stopped moving.

Yang Ye gazed silently at the four heads before him. Actually, while it seemed to have been accomplished with such ease, every single attack he executed had been Split Second, and they contained the energy of numerous Laws.

It could be said that every attack was his strongest!

Actually, if he utilized his Enlightened Rank intent and the Grand Teleportation Technique, then not to mention 4th stage True Realm experts, he had a very good chance to even kill a 6th stage True Realm expert. After all, he wasn’t the same after the time he spent in the Secret Sect!

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts, glanced at the surroundings, and vanished on the spot.

Around three breaths of time after Yang Ye vanished, a group suddenly appeared where Yang Ye Had been just a while ago.

The group was led by the Ying Clan’s patriarch, Ying Qing, and the Wang, Lu, Qin, and Li Clans patriarchs were by his side. Besides that, there were 30 other True Realm experts behind them.

Ying Qing and the others had extremely unsightly expressions on their faces when they saw the heads floating here in space. They’d rushed over immediately upon receiving news that Yang Ye had left the Secret Sect, but they still were too late!

“All killed with a single strike!” Lu Yuntian spoke solemnly, “His strength has grown even stronger.”

The expressions of everyone here became unsightly when they heard this.

Yang Ye had grown stronger!

That was naturally not a good thing for them. Because all of them knew that Yang Ye was an absolutely vengeful person, and he would definitely come for his revenge. Now, Yang Ye and Yang Lianshuang had hidden the members of the Yang Clan. In other words, they didn’t have to worry about anything anymore.

Once they came for revenge, they would be nightmares for them!

A long period of silence surrounded their group, and then Ying Qing spoke abruptly, “Do we have any information about the survivors of the Yang Clan?”

Lu Yuntian shook his head, “There was a huge teleportation formation below Phecda City, but it’s a one-way teleportation formation. Moreover, it has been destroyed. So, we can’t utilize it to find them. However, they should be within the borders of the medium universe.”

Ying Qing took a deep breath and glanced at the others, “Everyone, at this point, I think all of you understand the situation that we’re in. There’s no room for reconciliation between us and the Yang Clan. So, we must stay united! Otherwise, it’s very likely for them to crush us one by one!”

The others nodded to display their agreement.

Meanwhile, Ying Qing continued, “From now onwards, all five of our clans will maintain contact and establish teleportation formations between us. The other four clans will support any clans that’s being attacked.”

Lu Yuntian nodded, “No problem!”

The others nodded in agreement as well.

Ying Qing took a deep breath and looked up at the sky. At this moment, there was worry in his eyes.

A short moment of silence later, Ying Qing suddenly said, “From this moment onwards, summon back all the True Realm experts of your clans. If… if it’s possible, ask your ancestors to leave their places of close door cultivation as well!”

He vanished on the spot once he finished speaking.

The atmosphere here instantly became oppressive.

A storm was approaching!

…

In the starry sky, Yang Ye flew swiftly on his sword. He was like a shooting star that shot through the starry sky.

After quite some time passed, Yang Ye arrived before a planet. As soon as he arrived there, a woman appeared before him.

It was Yang Lianshuang!

Yang Lianshuang said, “I thought you were dead!”

Yang Ye shook his head, “My life is pretty tough! It isn’t that easy to kill me!”

Yang Lianshuang grinned, “I think so too! Come, your wives and the others have been extremely worried about you!”

Yang Ye nodded. It didn’t take long for him to arrive before an ancient city with Yang Lianshuang.

She said as they stood outside the city, “This city was built by a patriarch of our Yang Clan a very, very long time ago. Only the patriarchs of the Yang Clan knew about it.”

“Then how did you find out?” Yang Ye gazed at Yang Lianshuang. After all, she hadn’t obtained the position of patriarch through ordinary means. Yang Xiao would have never told her about these secrets.

She grinned and withdrew a seal, “This is the token of identity possessed by the Yang Clan’s patriarch, and many secrets of our Yang Clan are recorded within it.”

Yang Ye nodded, “I see! Let’s go!”

Yang Lianshuang nodded slightly, and then they entered the ancient city.
