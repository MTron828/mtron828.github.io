Chapter 2806 – Decide Fate!

A third!

That attack of Yang Ye’s had instantly killed a third of the peak Destiny Realm experts from the Four Dimensional Universe!

All of them were stunned as they gazed at the corpses before them.

Even Monarch Yan was stunned.

The Fate Sword Dao was very formidable, but he hadn’t expected this attack of Yang Ye’s to be this formidable.

A single attack had instantly annihilated over a dozen peak Destiny Realm experts!

At this moment, Monarch Yan was finally quite shocked.

Perhaps Yang Ye’s strength wasn’t as formidable as the strongest form of Destiny, but he was sure of one thing, and it was that Yang Ye’s strength absolutely surpassed him.

It even could be said that Yang Ye was above all except Destiny!

Yang Ye looked up at Monarch Yan’s group, “You said that you would spare my loved ones if you kill me. So, now, I’ll give you a chance too. You stay behind, and I won’t kill your people if they agree to leave.”

Monarch Yan had to die! Even if he felt a little bit of respect for Monarch Yan.

Because Jian Wudi had died at Monarch Yan’s hands!

He’d never forgotten that!

Regardless of whether it was Chen Xuanan or Jian Wudi, he felt something for them. Especially Jian Wudi, the old man had stepped forward to help him on so many occasions when he needed it.

He had to get revenge for Jian Wudi!

Monarch Yan stared at Yang Ye, and no one knew what he was thinking.

Yang Ye asked indifferently, “You refuse?”

He walked forward with his sword in hand.

Absolutely unsightly expressions appeared on the faces of those experts from the Four Dimensional Universe, and they were extremely fearful as well.

They could besiege Yang Ye, and Yang Ye wouldn’t be able to fight back against so many. But the problem was Yang Ye’s Fate Sword Dao! The more danger he was in, the stronger he would become!

It could be said that if they couldn’t crush Yang Ye in an instant, only death would await them!

None of them could stop an attack that carried his Fate Sword Dao! Even Monarch Yan didn’t dare to go head on against it!

While they feared Yang Ye, they didn’t shrink back!

Yang Ye grew closer and closer to them. There was no sword intent or slaughter intent coming from him, nor did he reveal the determination to decide on their fate. However, the pressure he gave them was absolutely horrifying.

This sword cultivator before them was absolutely formidable and beyond them!

That was what many of them thought at this moment.

Yang Ye grabbed his sword’s hilt and was about to swing it when Monarch Yan suddenly said, “Let’s make a deal!”

Yang Ye gazed at Monarch Yan, and the latter looked him in the eyes, “The Four Dimensional Universe isn’t habitable anymore. Even if my people head back there, only death awaits. The Three Dimensional Universe can still maintain life for a very, very long time. It will last for at least tens of thousands of years. I want my people to stay here in the Three Dimensional Universe.”

Yang Ye shook his head, “No!”

The Four Dimensional Universe was strong while the Three Dimensional Universe was weak. If these experts were to stay, they would definitely take over in the end, and that would be a calamity for the Three Dimensional Universe!

Monarch Yan spoke solemnly, “I know what you’re worried about. Yang Ye, my people and some other living beings from the Four Dimensional Universe are only just a few million in number, and that’s nothing to the Three Dimensional Universe. They won’t be able to pose any threats to the Three Dimensional Universe while you’re here.”

Yang Ye replied indifferently, “What if I’m not here?”

Monarch Yan fell silent for a long time. In the end, he looked up at Yang Ye, “According to my knowledge, you’ve established a form of order here, so what if my people and the others are willing to abide by it?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “I may die. Allow me to be honest, if your people are here once I die, this Three Dimensional Universe may immediately become engulfed by the flames of war.”

Monarch Yan walked over to Yang Ye, and he was so close that if Yang Ye attacked now, he would definitely be in grave danger.

Monarch Yan didn’t have the fiery lightning or black lotus now, so he couldn’t resist Yang Ye at all.

But Yang Ye didn’t attack!

Monarch Yan looked Y in the eyes, “The Four Dimensional Universe and Three Dimensional Universes aren’t far apart. If I detonate it, your Three Dimensional Universe will suffer the brunt of it.”

He pointed down below, “There are still a few million of my people. Besides you, the Three Dimensional Universe has no one capable of stopping them. If you really want to continue fighting, my Four Dimensional Universe will be annihilated, but your Three Dimensional Universe won’t be any better!”

Yang Ye suddenly swung his sword.

Even though it wasn’t as strong as an attack containing his Fate Sword Dao, it wasn’t weak. Monarch Yan was blasted over 30km away!

The experts in the surroundings were about to attack, but Monarch Yan suddenly spoke furiously, “Stop!” He was very well aware that if they faced Yang Ye now, they would only be slaughtered!

All of them stopped upon hearing him.

Monarch Yan gazed at Yang Ye while blood seeped out incessantly from the corner of his mouth.

Yang Ye looked him in the eyes, “I don’t like being threatened!”

Monarch Yan shook his head, “I’m imploring you. Yang Ye, my people just need a small world with spirit energy. I guarantee that they won’t cause trouble. They just need a place to live!”

Yang Ye still shook his head, “They will not dare to show themselves while I’m here, but if I’m gone, they will emerge into the world. As for your guarantee, allow me to be honest, it cannot be trusted! Moreover, I don’t want to let many unstable elements into the Three Dimensional Universe!”

He'd created a new type of order here, and he didn’t want it to be destroyed by outsiders.

Monarch Yan stared at Yang Ye, “The Four Dimensional Universe was on the verge of destruction, and Destiny’s attack added fuel to the fire. Now, the Four Dimensional Universe only has 10 years at most before it faces destruction.”

Yang Ye said, “That doesn’t seem to have anything to do with me. I only protect the Three Dimensional Universe. You came here to slaughter and take over, but now that you’ve lost the ability to do so, you want peace? I’m sorry but I refuse to accept it!”

Yang Ye was about to swing his sword once he finished speaking, but Monarch Yan suddenly said, “Don’t you want to know how strong that woman is?”

Yang Ye frowned slightly, “What do you mean?”

Monarch Yan looked him in the eyes, “I’ll show you.”

As he spoke, he gazed at the experts from the Four Dimensional Universe, “My people and demons, hear me! From this moment onward, Yang Ye is my clan’s patriarch, and his words are mine. No one shall disobey him. Only death awaits anyone who dares to go against him.”

He gazed at Yang Ye and flicked a pitch black ring over to Yang Ye, “The Yanmo Ring, the symbol of the Yanmo Clan’s patriarch. It can be used to control the Heaven Devouring Formation behind me. If it’s assisted by the Sprite Progenitor, its strength will definitely rise a level higher. Besides that, there’s a destruction formation in my Four Dimensional Universe that can instantly destroy the entire Four Dimensional Universe when activated. You can use the explosion against your enemies, and it’s the final trump card of my clan!”

Yang Ye frowned slightly, “Why don’t you use it against us?”

Monarch Yan shook his head, “We just want to survive, not destroy the Three Dimensional Universe. I’ll leave the entire Four Dimensional Universe to you. And watch carefully, see what level that woman is at! That’s all I can do!”

He suddenly soared up slowly, and his speed gradually increased while fiery red flames appeared around him.

Soul Ignition!

Not just his soul, even his body had been ignited!

“Patriarch…” Countless experts fell to their knees.Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Monarch Yan’s body transformed into a fireball, and his aura was at a terrifying level!

The entire Eternal Kingdom turned ethereal because it couldn’t endure Monarch Yan’s aura!

It could be said that Monarch Yan’s current aura wasn’t any weaker to Yang Ye’s attacks that carried the Fate Sword Dao, and it may even be stronger. Because Monarch Yan was using up all his strength, and he was even burning his soul and body as fuel to forcibly increase his strength!

At this moment, Monarch Yan was undoubtedly the strongest expert in the Destiny Transcendence Realm!

Even Yang Ye was extremely fearful of the aura Monarch Yan was emanating right now. When a Destiny Transcendence Realm expert ignited his soul and body, how terrifying would that expert be? Moreover, Monarch Yan was no ordinary Destiny Transcendence Realm expert!

A moment later, Monarch Yan passed through space.

Now, only Yang Ye could still see Monarch Yan, and space was being obliterated in Monarch Yan’s wake…

Unstoppable!

Yang Ye had a solemn expression on his face. If Monarch Yan had risked it all against him just now, it would really be impossible to determine the outcome of their battle. Of course, the final outcome would be that Monarch Yan’s death would be guaranteed. Because such strength was strength that he shouldn’t possess, and he’d only obtained it by sacrificing his life!

Yang Ye watched as Monarch Yan passed through countless layers of space. In the end, he arrived below an expanse of clouds, and Yang Ye could faintly see a tree high above the clouds.

He knew that a godlike woman was up there!

Monarch Yan, who was now like a fireball, grew closer and closer to the clouds, and the world there seemed to be completely unaffected by his arrival!

It wasn’t the Three Dimensional Universe or the Four Dimensional Universe!

Both universes were incapable of staying completely unaffected by such strength!

Suddenly, a sword descended from above the clouds.

Justice!

It descended slowly from above in an absolutely calm and casual manner!

Yang Ye tightened his grip on his sword’s sheath as he stared at Justice. A short moment later, Justice stabbed against the fireball.

At this moment, Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly.

A moment of silence ensued, and then Justice passed through the fireball.

Hiss!

Countless tongues of flames shot into the surroundings and descended like a meteor shower.

Gone!

He was gone just like that!

Only Justice floated silently in the air.

Meanwhile, a woman appeared within Yang Ye’s field of vision. She looked down at him from above the clouds and had a smile on her face, “That attack was an attack of fate as well. However, it does not attempt to decide fate, it determines fate!”

It determines fate!
