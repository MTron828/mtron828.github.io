Chapter 2033 – A Sage!

Don’t even think about it!

Yang Ye didn’t hesitate to draw his sword and swing it.

However, his sword stopped around half an inch away from the face and couldn’t descend further, no matter what.

The face laughed with ridicule, “You would be dead if it wasn’t for that thing you possess!”

The face suddenly vanished once it finished speaking.

The shrill cries in the pillar of white light had vanished.

Only blood could be seen in there!

The entire pillar of white light had been transformed into a blood red pillar of light!

Ji Yue remained silent, and no one knew what she was thinking.

Yang Ye was silent too, and his face was quite gloomy.

A long time passed before Ji Yue spoke softly, “What was that?”

Yang Ye spoke in a low voice, “An evil treasure!”

That evil treasure which had been watching him in secret had finally shown itself.

“An evil treasure?” She gazed at Yang Ye, “The type of evil treasure that was born with this universe?”

Yang Ye nodded, “It should be!”

Ji Yue spoke softly, “No wonder…”

Yang Ye gazed at her, “What?”

She spoke in a low voice, “Treasure of extreme evil like it are extremely hostile towards divine beasts and natural spirits, and they can be considered to be mortal enemies.”

Yang Ye suddenly asked, “What about Sprite Lords?”

Ji Yue gazed at Yang Ye, “Those are mortal enemies amongst mortal enemies. Even though all of them are living beings born from this world, they are on completely different paths. Just like people, people have a good side and bad side!”

Mortal enemies!

Yang Ye’s face had turned extremely gloomy.

Snowy!

I can’t let Snowy come outside anymore. She’s a Sprite Lord, and her combat ability is practically nonexistent. If that evil treasure suddenly attacks… Yang Ye’s face grew even gloomier.

It hadn’t shown itself in the past, nor had it attacked anyone in front of him. Yet now, it dared to attack, so it represented that it had grown stronger.

Ji Yue suddenly asked, “How did you offend it?”

Yang Ye laughed bitterly, “By accident.”

He gazed at the blood red pillar of light, “Miss Ji Yue, I’m sorry. I didn’t expect it to suddenly attack. That divine beast…”

Ji Yue shook her head, “Perhaps this is its fate.”

Yang Ye didn’t know what else to say. The Ji Clan had lost a divine beast because of him. Even though it was the evil treasure, it was he who’d brought it here.

“Brother Yang, don’t worry about it!” Meanwhile, Ji Yue suddenly spoke softly, “As I said, this may be its fate. Moreover, you didn’t do it intentionally. So, let’s just forget it and leave!”

Yang Ye nodded, and then he pushed Ji Yue along as he floated up slowly. Yang Ye’s gaze was fixed on the blood red pillar of light as they ascended. In the past, he didn’t really pay much attention to the evil treasure, yet now, the facts before him told him that it was much more terrifying than he’d ever imagined!

It didn’t take long for them to leave the river.

Meanwhile, the Ji Clan’s ancestor appeared before them.

Yang Ye asked, “Senior, you noticed it earlier, right?”

The old man nodded.

Yang Ye asked another question, “Why didn’t you stop it?”

The old man shook his head and laughed bitterly, “How would I? If I were still alive, then it would naturally not do anything before me. However, Kid, you must understand that I’m dead, and I should be happy if it doesn’t come looking for trouble with me.”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

Meanwhile, the old man said, “I came here to tell you that ordinary people can’t deal with something like it. Even a supreme Sage can’t destroy it. I noticed that you possess the Dao Path and Weapon Path’s inheritances, so you should go to them. I think that they should be able to deal with it for you!”

Yang Ye nodded, “Thank you for the reminder!”

The old man hesitated for a moment and said, “Kid, my Ji Clan’s divine beast was killed. Aren’t you going to do anything about it?”

Yang Ye was quite embarrassed, “Err, Senior, I don’t have another divine beast!”

The old man smiled, “How about this? You came here to repay a favor. However, you weren’t able to save my Ji Clan’s divine beast. So, I won’t ask you to replace it, but you’ll continue owing my Ji Clan a favor. Alright?”

A favor!

Yang Ye was speechless.

“Ancestor!” Suddenly, Ji Yue said, “Don’t make things difficult for Young Master Yang.”

The old man smiled. He didn’t say a word and just gazed at Yang Ye.

Yang Ye smiled, “I should. Miss ji Yu, while I didn’t do it on purpose, it was my fault. Just as this Senior has said, I’m willing to owe the Ji Clan a favor. If the Ji Clan needs my help in the future, I won’t refuse if it’s within my ability!”

The old man smiled when he received Yang Ye’s promise. He glanced at Ji Yue and said, “Little Girl, the Ji Clan’s future is in your hands.”

He vanished on the spot.

Ji Yue gazed at the palace for a long time, and then she said, “Brother Yang, let’s go!”

Yang Ye nodded and pushed her away.

Outside the city, Yang Ye and Ji Yue saw Xuanyuan Yan. Surprise flashed through Xuanyuan Yan’s eyes when he saw them, “Miss Ji Yue, you’re this fast too?”

Ji Yue grinned, “Brother Xuanyuan, you’re much faster!”

Xuanyuan Yan smiled, “That fellow from the Gui Clan was even faster.”

“Is that so?” Ji Yue nodded and didn’t say anything.

Xuanyuan Yan smiled and said, “Miss Ji Yue, farewell. I’ll see you again during the meeting of the clans!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Xuanyuan Yan was about to leave, but all three of them suddenly looked towards the side.

A robust man was walking towards them.

The man’s figure was extremely robust. Just his arm was as thick as Yang Ye’s waist, and he was carrying a huge iron hammer on his shoulder.

Ji Yue and Xuanyuan Yan frowned at the sight of him.

Meanwhile, the masked old man appeared behind Ji Yue, and he had an extremely vigilant expression on his face!

The man ignored them and arrived before the city walls. He glanced at it and said, “This thing should have been destroyed a long time ago!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he tossed the hammer forward!

Xuanyuan Yan was fast, and he immediately appeared before the hammer. An instant later, the sword on his back shot up into the sky, and it stabbed straight at the iron hammer.

However, an extremely powerful wave of energy surged out from the iron hammer as soon as Xuanyuan Yan’s sword stabbed it, and Xuanyuan Yan’s sword was instantly blasted into bits. At the same time, Xuanyuan Yan was blasted away, and he was blasted all the way out of their fields of vision!

The iron hammer slammed against the city walls!

Boom!

The city walls around the city crumbled, and only four palaces remained within it. They were on the four corners. There were numerous thin barriers of light around the palaces. Obviously, they were formations!

Suddenly, Ji Yue asked, “Who are you?!”

The middle aged glanced at Ji Yue, and then a wave of energy swept towards her. Meanwhile, the old man behind Ji Yue suddenly appeared in front of her, and he overlapped his palms before pushing them forward.

Boom!

However, Yang Ye and Ji Yue were astonished to see the old man blasted away, and he flew almost 3km before he finally stopped, and the ground crumbled beneath his feet!

A mouthful of blood sprayed from the old man, and then he looked up at the middle aged man, “The Sage Realm!”

The Sage Realm!

Yang Ye’s pupils constricted! The man before them was actually a Sage!

A Sage!

Yang Ye was naturally quite shocked. It was the first time he’d met a living Sage!

The middle aged man didn’t answer the masked old man, and he looked towards the white palace on the left, “I presume that’s Emperor Xuanyuan’s grave. You’re lucky to have been able to rest peacefully for so many years.”

The middle aged man tapped his finger forward, and a strand of bright lightning surged forward.

Boom!

The palace exploded into pieces.

After it was blasted into bits, a ray of white light floated out from it, and an ethereal figure could be faintly seen within it.

An instant later, a voice resounded, “A surviving bastard!”

The middle aged man laughed coldly and tapped once more.

Bang!

The white light exploded apart.

Once he shattered the white light, the middle aged man turned around and left.

“How dare you!” Suddenly, a furious shout came from far away in the sky, and then a huge palm tore through the sky and clawed at the middle aged man.

Yang Ye’s expression changed at the sight of this, and he took Ji Yue along with him as he retreated over 10km away!

The middle aged man had a wisp of ridicule on the corners of his lips, and he just raised his hand and slammed his fist forward.

Boom! L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

The might of his punch instantly obliterated the huge palm in the sky.

Meanwhile, a white haired old man appeared in the sky. There was faint white light around the old man!

A Sage!

Another Sage!

Two Sages were here!

The white haired old man stared at the middle aged man, “You’re not a Sage of my human race, nor are you a Sage of the sky race, so who are you? Why have you destroyed the tomb of my Xuanyuan Clan’s ancestor?!”

The middle aged man spoke coldly, “Does it make a difference? Let’s just fight!”

The middle aged man shot up into the sky. Suddenly, a voice resounded deep within the sky, “This is my territory!”

Along with this voice, a wave of powerful pressure rained down from the sky.

Boom!

An explosion resounded, and the entire world here fell silent.

After that, an old man in linen robes walked over slowly from afar.

A Sage!

Another Sage!
