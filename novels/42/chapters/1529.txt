Chapter 1530 - I Was Joking!

Translator: InVader

Yang Ye clenched his right hand slowly upon hearing that.

He looked towards the source of the voice, and he saw a black robed man lying against a wall not too far away from him. The man wasn’t more than 30 years of age, wore a black robe, and had a faint smile on his face. He seemed utterly carefree.

Yang Ye sized up the man and said, “I’m sure I don’t know you!”

“That’s fine!” The man smiled, “All that matters is that I know you.” As he spoke, he glanced at the surroundings and said, “Killing is prohibited here. How about we go somewhere else?”

Yang Ye glanced at him, “What if I refuse?”

A smile curled up on the corners of the black robed man’s mouth, “I think that you definitely don’t want others to know your whereabouts, right? For example, the War Pavilion and Emperor Sect.”

Yang Ye gazed at the man for a long time, and then he said, “Alright, let’s go somewhere else.”

“Come with me!” As soon as he finished speaking, the black robed man vanished on the spot.

Yang Ye immediately followed after him.

It didn’t take long for them to leave the city and arrive at a mountain outside the city.

The man stopped and turned around to look at Yang Ye, “You’re very curious about why I recognize you, right?”

Yang Ye nodded, “Indeed.”

The man waved his right hand, and a portrait appeared not too far away from Yang Ye. It was Yang Ye’s face which was drawn on it. Yang Ye gazed at the black robed man and asked, “Who drew that?”

The black robed man chuckled, “Mo Xiaoleng!”

Mo Xiaoleng! Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly. Her again! She’s so obsessed with killing me!

The black robed man sized up Yang Ye and said, “If I kill you, I won’t just gain a divine flame, I’ll even be able to enter the Divine Phoenix Sect’s Hallowed Grounds. I’m a Deity right now. If I can cultivate there, I’ll have a good chance of attaining the Dualism Realm. I can’t reject such an opportunity. So, I took the mission.”

He paused for a moment at this point, and then he continued, “You’re definitely very curious about how I found you. The reason is very simple. You’re new to the large world, so you have to pass through Formation City to get anywhere here. Thus, I started waiting here for you from the very beginning. Sure enough, you came here!”

“So that’s how you did it!” Yang Ye nodded, “I’ve never met someone who desired death so desperately.”

“Desire death?” The man chuckled, “Yang Ye, you’re quite capable since you were able to get up here. However, don’t tell me that those five Rebirth Realm experts were really killed by you.”

Yang Ye gazed at him, “What if it’s true?”

A wisp of ridicule appeared on the corners of the black robed man’s mouth, “Yang Ye, are you joking? You killed five Rebirth Realm experts? A Semi-Deity like you? How absurd! Not to mention you, even if the Unfettered One is reborn, it’s impossible for him to kill five Rebirth Realm experts while at the Semi-Deity Realm! If I’m not wrong, someone definitely helped you, like the Nether Pavilion. Right?”

Yang Ye spoke indifferently, “Wouldn’t you know if you give it a try?”

“Of course I’m going to try!” As soon as he finished speaking, a spear appeared in his grasp, and then he shot towards Yang Ye.

He was swift!

Extremely swift!

Yang Ye hadn’t even been able to react before the spear stabbed his chest.

Bang!

A muffled bang resounded while Yang Ye was pushed around 10m back.

After he stopped his figure, Yang Ye glanced at his chest. There was a mark on his chest, and the skin there had cracked open. Yang Ye looked up at the black robed man and said, “You have some ability indeed!”

The black robed man gazed at Yang Ye, and a solemn expression gradually filled his eyes, “What a strong body! Come, take another strike of my spear!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he shot up into the sky, and the dark clouds suddenly appeared in the once calm sky. After that, countless bolts of lightning flickered within the clouds.

“Lightning Spear!” The black robed man’s voice resounded in the sky, and then he stabbed his spear down in Yang Ye’s direction.

Crackle!

A sharp crackle resounded as the spear flashed down in Yang Ye’s direction. The energy it carried was extremely terrifying to the point it actually caused space to shudder and seem as if it couldn’t endure the might of this attack!

Yang Ye nodded slightly when he saw the black robed man’s attack. Needless to say, the quality of the geniuses in the large world was really not bad, and this black robed man was very strong. It could be said that even though he was just a Deity, he wasn’t weaker to a Dualism Realm expert!

The black robed man was no fool, and he’d come looking for Yang Ye because he was confident!

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts, drew his sword, and swung it.

Om!

A sword howl resounded. A ray of sword energy tore through the air and slammed against the lightning spear.

Bang!

An explosion resounded as soon as they collided with each other, and the entire sky shook violently. Yang Ye’s sword energy didn’t vanish, and it didn’t even slow down as it continued towards the black robed man.

The black robed man’s expression changed slightly when he saw his attack destroyed. At this moment, he knew that he’d underestimate Yang Ye. He didn’t have time to think, and he just immediately grabbed his spear with both hands and swung it down.

Boom!

Yang Ye’s sword intent was instantly blasted into bits. Meanwhile, Yang Ye appeared in front of the black robed man. This time, he didn’t execute Heavenrend or the Rebirth Sword, and he just stabbed his sword forward. Just a simple stab.

The black robed man instinctively raised his spear to block Yang Ye’s attack, but when his spear was just about to strike Yang Ye’s sword, Yang Ye twisted his wrist slightly and made his sword stab at an angle. It stabbed right against the tip of the black robed man’s spear.

Clang!

A clear and resounding clang resounded, and then the black robed man’s spear was blasted into the air. After that, Yang Ye continued the forward stab, and it shot straight towards the man’s chest!

The black robed man was shocked. Fortunately, his reaction was quick, and he hurriedly turned his body and avoided Yang Ye’s lethal attack. However, Yang Ye’s sword had still pierced through his shoulder. At the moment that happened, Yang Ye flicked his sword upwards.

Hiss!

The man’s entire arm was flicked away!

However, the black robed man’s figure flashed 3km away.

Yang Ye glanced at the black robed man and said, “Your reaction is quite fast.” Earlier, if the black robed man had reacted just a little slower, then he would have died. However, the black robed man’s reaction was very fast, and he didn’t give Yang Ye a chance to annihilate him with a single strike.

The black robed man stared at Yang Ye, “The ability to see through the flaws and weaknesses of others, Sword Insight! You…”

Suddenly, Yang Ye vanished on the spot, and he was in front of the black robed man when his figure appeared again. The black robed man was horrified, and he swung his remaining fist at Yang Ye.

Boom! 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

An explosion resounded, and the black robed man was blasted around 3km away. As soon as he stopped his figure, Yang Ye appeared in front of him, and a sword was pressed against his forehead.

The black robed man’s figure stiffened on the spot.

Yang Ye asked, “Are there any others besides you who are looking for me?”

The black robed man stared at Yang Ye. It didn’t take long for a wisp of self-ridicule to appear on the corners of his mouth, “Mo Xiaoleng said your strength is ordinary. Haha! Ordinary! Of course, it’s my fault. I was a fool who had his judgment clouded by greed, and I was too confident!”

Yang Ye suddenly asked, “Do you want to live?”

The black robed man was slightly stunned, and then he was overjoyed.

However…

Hiss!

The black robed man’s head flew up into the air.

Yang Ye sheathed his sword and spoke indifferently, “I was joking!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he waved his right hand. The black robed man’s spatial ring flew into his grasp, and then he turned around and walked away.

This encounter allowed Yang Ye to realize that the Divine Phoenix Clan hadn’t given up on killing him. Even though it was mainly Mo Xiaoleng who wanted his life, the Divine Phoenix Clan was definitely supporting her decision as well. Besides that, there was the War Pavilion and Emperor Sect. Those two powers were searching everywhere for him as well!

Should I change my dressing? Or change my appearance? Such thoughts appeared in Yang Ye’s mind, but it didn’t take long for him to discard them. Because even if they didn’t come looking for him, he would be going to look for them. Moreover, he didn’t want to act so cowardly. He wanted everyone to know that he was here, and that they could do nothing about it!

Yang Ye glanced at the black robed man’s spatial ring. There was quite a large number of miscellaneous items, but there was nothing that he valued, not even that spear. Even though it wasn’t bad, it was miles apart from the casket lid or Sword Precursor. However, at least he had 200,000 divine crystals!

Yang Ye had given all his divine crystals to Zhuang Weiran and the others before coming to the large world. So, divine crystals were quite important to him.

Yang Ye didn’t return to Formation City immediately. He found a hidden spot to recover his spirit energy first. He had to be at his peak at all times while he was in the large world.

Two hours later, Yang Ye stood up and returned to Formation City. But he suddenly stopped when he arrived at the entrance of the city, and then he glanced at the surroundings while his face became icy cold.

Meanwhile, a voice resounded, “Blood Sword Demon, my War Pavilion has been looking for you.”

As soon as the voice finished resounding, five cultivators appeared out of thin air around Yang Ye.

All of them were at the Dualism Realm!
