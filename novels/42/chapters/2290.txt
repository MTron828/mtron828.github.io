Chapter 2291 – I’m a very Benevolent Person!

The Immortal Estate!

Yang Ye closed his eyes slowly.

The two cities, three sects, and six clans had acted against him. Now, even the Immortal Estate was here.

Actually, it was within his expectations.

As the number one power of Eternal Border, how could it possibly let go of such a treasure trove?

Three divine treasures!

Even the Immortal Estate couldn’t avoid being tempted by that!

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings, and he noticed that there were some others here. Moreover, their auras weren’t weak.

Yang Ye chuckled, “Looks like the Immortal Estate isn’t the only one who covets those three treasures.”

She spoke softly, “It’s fine, they won’t do anything.”

Yang Ye smiled, “Looks like you’re very confident in the Immortal Estate.”

She stopped moving, “You have five breaths of time to consider.”

Yang Ye said, “How about we do this. The Immortal Estate can save my friend, and I’ll give those three treasures to you, alright?”

She chuckled, “You’re quite na?ve.”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Huh?”

She smiled, “You lack some self-awareness. Allow me to be honest. You don’t have the right to negotiate with my Immortal Estate. If we tell you to hand them over, you hand them over, understand?”

Yang Ye gazed at her and suddenly started laughing, “What an awesome way to think. Then allow me to be honest, who the fuck do you think you are?”

Yang Ye stomped his right foot down.

Hiss!

His figure transformed into a ray of light that vanished on the spot.

The woman frowned as she glanced at Yang Ye, and then she laid her zither down horizontally and plucked it gently.

A soundwave rippled forth.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye’s sword descended.

Bang!

Rays of light sprayed into the surroundings while both of them were pushed over 1km away. Yang Ye hadn’t even stopped himself when another soundwave rippled through space toward him. It was like a wave that soundlessly rippled toward him.

Yang Ye frowned slightly. He circulated his profound energy and swung his sword down with his right hand.

Hiss!

The space before him was sliced open like a rag, and the soundwave was sliced into bits too. Suddenly, a sharp and ear-piercing sound resounded, and sharp pain surged through Yang Ye’s ears. At the same time, he felt mincing pain come from his stomach before his figure was blasted away.

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!

At the moment Yang Ye was blasted away, the space before him fluctuated strangely. It seemed like something was wriggling within it.

It was a soundwave!

Yang Ye took a step forward, and then two types of intents swept out from him. An instant later, they flashed along with a ray of sword energy.

Hiss!

The powerful sword energy tore through everything. Everywhere it passed, space was obliterated, truly obliterated! As for the woman in a white dress, her soundwave had been sliced into bits!

A moment later, his sword arrived before her.

There was no fear in her eyes. She held her zither with her left hand while plucking it gently with her right hand. In an instant, numerous soundwaves surged forward like a storm, and they forcefully stopped Yang Ye’s sword energy and intents.

They were in a stalemate!

A moment of silence ensued, and then Yang Ye turned ethereal.

The Sword Domain!

A moment later, the woman’s pupils constricted while a sword descended.

Bang!

An explosion resounded, and her zither exploded apart while her figure was blasted away. Meanwhile, Yang Ye tapped his right foot down and transformed into a ray of light that shot forward.

He was extremely swift.

A sword descended from above the woman.

The Sword Domain again!

It was even stronger than the last attack!

The woman looked up at this attack while shock filled her eyes!

She’d collected some information about Yang Ye before coming, but it hadn’t been much. All she knew was that he was a talented and strong genius. But the Immortal Estate had countless geniuses like that, so she didn’t pay too much attention to him. However, she’d been mistaken.

Absolutely mistaken!

He was no genius, he was a monstrous genius!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye’s sword descended.

A golden disc appeared above her, and it forcefully stopped Yang Ye’s sword. However, it cracked open the golden disc.

“Slash!” Yang Ye suddenly howled with fury, and he slammed his sword down again.

Bang!

The golden disc exploded apart, and she was blasted away. Meanwhile, Yang Ye’s figure vanished on the spot.

A ray of light flashed.

The woman’s pupils constricted, and she was about to dodge, but it was too late.

A sword had already pressed against the woman’s throat.

The surroundings fell silent.

She stared at Yang Ye. Meanwhile, Yang Ye flicked his sword lightly, and her veil was instantly obliterated.

An absolutely gorgeous face appeared before him!

Exquisite features, slanted brows, an oval face, and a pair of eyes clear as a pool of water in autumn. Her white dress made her seem pure and noble like a goddess, and coupled with that slender figure of hers, it wasn’t exaggerated to call her drop dead gorgeous. Besides that, there was a wisp of blood on the corner of her mouth, so it made her seem even more enchanting.

“The number one beauty of the Immortal Estate!” Someone spoke softly far away, “The Zither Maiden, one of the three beauties of Eternal Border. I never expected her to come herself. Interesting…”

The woman looked Yang Ye in the eyes, “I underestimated you. However, it has never ended well for anyone who goes against my Immortal Estate.”

Yang Ye suddenly pinched her chin and said, “Such a beautiful face. What a pity.”

Yang Ye twisted his right hand.

Hiss!

A gorgeous head flew up into the air while accompanied by a strand of blood.

The gorgeous head had its eyes wide open, and they were filled with disbelief.

At this moment, it was beautiful yet horrifying at the same time.

Everyone watching from the shadows was shocked!

He’d killed her!

Yang Ye had actually killed the number one beauty of the Immortal Estate!

No one had expected this. If Yang Ye was a woman, then it would be understandable. But Yang Ye was a man, and any man would feel some pity and sympathy toward a gorgeous woman like her. Not to mention that she was even from Immortal Estate!

Immortal Estate was the number one power in Eternal Border. So, killing her represented that the enmity between him and Immortal Estate was irreconcilable now. Moreover, Yang Ye definitely knew that, yet he’d still killed her!

He’d killed her without the slightest hesitation!

At the same time that they were shocked, a trace of fear had appeared within them.

Fear!

This time, Yang Ye had instilled some fear in them. Yang Ye was ruthless, strong, and brave. He was someone who didn’t care about the consequences at all!

Yang Ye held his bloody sword and turned toward the Shiyuan Clan, and Zither Maiden’s head and corpse were behind him.

“Yang Ye!” Suddenly, a beautiful woman appeared nearby.

She was the beautiful woman from the Luoli Clan who had escaped previously.

Yang Ye stopped and gazed at her. She’d recovered already.

She spoke solemnly, “Do you know what you’ve done?”

Yang Ye replied indifferently, “Are you planning on telling me how strong the Immortal Estate is?”

She said, “You know nothing about the Immortal Estate! They are more terrifying than the Shiyuan Clan which you’re about to face!”

Yang Ye shrugged and spoke helplessly, “What can I do about that? I’m filled with despair too! I’m not the one going to offend them, it’s they who want to kill me. So, are you telling me that I can only let them kill me?”

She gazed at him for a long time and said, “You’re ruthless, and you have balls!”

Yang Ye cracked a smile, “Thanks for the compliment!”

He turned around and walked toward the Shiyuan Clan.

Yang Ye’s figure gradually vanished into the distance.

Once he vanished, an old man and woman appeared here.

If Yang Ye was here, he would definitely be surprised. Because she was the White Empress of White Emperor City, Bai Zhixian!

Bai Zhixian glanced at Yang Ye’s vanishing figure in silence. No one knew what she was thinking.

As for the old man, it was Fen Tianyu of Sword Sky City.

As he watched Yang Ye leave, Fen Tianyu shook his head slightly, “A sword that never bends! Unfortunately, a sword that doesn’t bend suitably will break!”

He sighed softly and left. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

As far as he was concerned, there was no hope for Yang Ye. Even if Yang Ye could survive the Shiyuan Clan, he couldn’t survive the Immortal Estate.

The woman from the Luoli Clan glanced at Bai Zhixian, “According to my knowledge, he fell into your hands for a time, but he left safely. Moreover, his strength grew too. Is it because you two know each other?”

Bai Zhixian gazed at her and said, “It’s none of your business!”

The beautiful woman’s face instantly turned quite unsightly. However, she didn’t dare to do anything. While Bai Zhixian was a True Dao Realm expert too, Bai Zhixian’s strength far surpassed her.

Bai Zhixian ignored the woman and looked off in the direction of the Shiyuan Clan before turning around and leaving.

She was naturally here to kill Yang Ye. After all, she had to personally avenge the humiliation she suffered that day. So, she’d immediately come in search of Yang Ye upon recuperating. However, there was no need for her to do anything.

Fight an entire clan on his own?

Not to mention Yang Ye was only at the Progenitor Realm right now, it was impossible even if he was at the True Dao Realm!

A huge clan that had existed for so many years was absolutely not something a Progenitor could overturn!

It was impossible!

Not to mention that Yang Ye had killed someone from the Immortal Estate. So, even if Yang Ye could make peace with the Shiyuan Clan or kill his way out, he wouldn’t be able to escape the Immortal Estate.

Yang Ye’s death was guaranteed!

After Bai Zhixian left, many others left as well. The Shiyuan Clan prohibited others from entering the Initial Grounds. So, even if they wanted to go inside, they couldn’t. As for going in by force, they didn’t want to cause a war. Not to mention that the Shiyuan Clan’s formations were the best among the six clans.

The beautiful woman shook her head and left.

…

It didn’t take long for Yang Ye to over the mountain and enter the Initial Grounds.

Yang Ye arrived before an ancient city, and there were two words atop it—Initial City.

The walls of it were around 300m tall. They weren’t very huge when compared to the cities he’d seen, but white light frequently flickered around the city. Besides that, he sensed a strand of mysterious energy beneath his feet.

The energy was very well hidden, and he wouldn’t have been able to discover it without the Sword Domain. Besides that, it was very strong!

Yang Ye fell silent on the spot for a short while, and then he stabbed his sword into the ground. He looked up at the city and was about to speak when a young man suddenly descended before him. The young man sized up Yang Ye, spread his legs, and smiled, “Yang Ye, if you want An Nanjing to stay alive, then go through beneath me. I…”

Suddenly, a ray of light flashed, and the young man’s voice stopped abruptly.

Yang Ye slowly pulled out his sword from the young man’s neck, and blood sprayed like a fountain.

It didn’t take long for him to fully pull out his sword. The young man held his throat with both hands while ceaselessly twitching on the spot.

Terror filled his eyes! Yes, terror! He hadn’t expected to be unable to even fight back against Yang Ye!

Of course, he’d been even more surprised that Yang Ye refused to even hesitate before his threats and had immediately attacked!

Yang Ye glanced at the young man on the ground, “Is it very painful? Sorry, I didn’t control my strength well and didn’t kill you immediately. It’s fine, I’m a benevolent person. Just beg me and I’ll kill you, alright?”

The young man stared at Yang Ye while the desire to kill filled his eyes. He spoke ferociously, “Yang Ye, you… An Nanjing will die! S-She will die!”

Yang Ye cracked a smile, “Let’s not discuss that for now. To be honest, I haven’t practiced with my sword for a long time. I wonder how my technique is. This is a perfect opportunity to try.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye started waving his sword gently. Every swing of his sword would remove a very thin layer of flesh from the young man’s body!

He was slicing him alive!

The young man gazed at Yang Ye with horror and screamed hysterically.

Yang Ye’s sword didn’t stop at all while he smiled, “Beg me. Beg me to kill you. I’m a very benevolent person!”
