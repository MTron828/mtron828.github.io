Chapter 1900 – What? You’re Afraid?

Yang Ye naturally didn’t just sit there and wait for death to arrive. As soon as the pike stabbed through his skin, he’d vanished on the spot.

Yang Ye glanced at his chest as he stood far away. There was a hole there and blood was seeping out incessantly.

Meanwhile, Hou Qing’s voice resounded again, “Kid, be careful of her weapon. Her weapon was specially made to pierce the defenses of our shaman race. No! Kid, don’t get locked in battle with her. Run immediately or you’ll be in big trouble!”

Run!

Yang Ye shook his head because that wasn’t his style. He gazed at her, and she suddenly said, “You really do have the shaman race’s bloodline!”

A drop of blood was burning on her pike.

It was Yang Ye’s blood!

She looked up at him and said, “As a human, cultivating the cultivation techniques of the shaman race is a serious offense. You deserve death!”

As soon as she finished speaking, her pike shot forward. As soon as it arrived before him, she was behind the pike, and she grabbed it and twisted it.

Yang Ye looked her in the eyes while a cold glow flashed through his eyes, and then he pressed his middle and index fingers together before tapping them forward.

A ray of light coiled around the tip of his fingers.

Bang!

As soon as their attacks came into contact, the pike shook violently, but Yang Ye’s fingers were pulled back as if he’d been shocked by electricity. At the same time, he moved around 1km back.

Yang Ye glanced at his fingers. They’d cracked open, and he would have lost them if he was just a little slower.

He looked up at the pike in the woman’s grasp, and he truly understood how strong it was as a counter for his physical body.

Hou Qing’s voice was quite anxious, “Kid, stop trying to fight her. You’ll be in big trouble once she places a Blood Brand on you. Even I wouldn’t dare to go head-on against people from the Shaman Hunter Clan. Listen to me and flee right now!”

Flee!

Yang Ye laughed bitterly, “Senior, I think it’s too cowardly to flee just like that.”

As he spoke, he looked up at the woman, and then he took a step forward and tapped his fingers forward again. The space before her suddenly tore open, and then a ray of light flashed out and slashed down towards her.

She closed her eyes slowly while clenching tightly to the pike in her right hand. An instant later, a ray of red light surged out from the blood red sword-shaped mark on her forehead.

Bang!

Yang Ye’s sword energy was blasted into bits, and the ray of red light didn’t slow down at all as it shot towards Yang Ye.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye had vanished on the spot, and he was behind her when he appeared again. This time, there was a sword in his grasp.

He drew it!

A sword howl resounded, and then a beam of sword energy slashed down towards her from above.

At the same time, the woman turned around and stabbed her pike upwards.

Bang!

Yang Ye remained on the spot while she was blasted over 1km away.

“Swords!” Suddenly, Yang Ye’s voice resounded, and then ten ethereal swords appeared around the woman. A moment later, rays of light crisscrossed and enveloped her.

The Sword Control Technique!

Presently, he could fight both at close quarters and from afar.

The swords emanated rays of light as they surrounded her like a storm of swords. During this period, the woman had broken a few of the swords, but as soon as they vanished, a new one would immediately appear to take its place.

They were endless!

“Night Crow!” Suddenly, the woman’s voice resounded.

A moment later, an extremely terrifying aura swept out from her, and then Yang Ye’s swords were shattered. At the same time, a black bird appeared above her.

It was completely pitch black and had a single leg.

Yang Ye had seen that bird before. It had been on her shoulder when they first met. But at this moment, it was much larger than it had been.

Yang Ye stood there with his sword in hand. He stretched out his hand and made a provoking gesture at the bird, “Come!”

A vicious glow immediately flashed through its eyes, and then it flapped its wings and transformed into a ray of black light that shot towards Yang Ye.

Yang Ye was about to swing his sword when it suddenly opened its mouth.

“Screech!” A sharp cry resounded, and it surged straight into Yang Ye’s ears. In an instant, Yang Ye felt extremely uncomfortable.

His eardrums hurt, and it felt like something had torn them open.

In that exact same instant, the bird suddenly flew over to Yang Ye, and then its claws grabbed onto Yang Ye’s shoulders. It intended to tear him apart.

Suddenly, a ray of golden light appeared around Yang Ye.

The Gold Form!

At this moment, Yang Ye didn’t dare act carelessly, and he activated the Gold Form. His mind instantly cleared up once he used the Gold Form. Meanwhile, he felt the bird’s claws trying to tear him apart!

It hurt!

At this moment, Yang Ye felt quite a bit of lingering fear. Because if he hadn’t used the Gold Form, it was very likely that he would have been torn apart.

Yang Ye didn’t give it any further thought, and he just raised his sword and stabbed.

Bang!

The bird was blasted away. Meanwhile, the woman appeared before Yang Ye with her pike in hand.

The cold glow in Yang Ye’s eyes transformed into viciousness when he saw her stab her pike at him.

He was furious!

Yang Ye took a step forward, and then a wave of mysterious energy suddenly appeared here.

The Sword Domain!

This time, he’d utilized the Sword Domain.

Yang Ye instantly vanished on the spot.

Split Second!

The woman’s expression changed drastically.

Hiss!

A moment later, her pike was suddenly split into two. At the same time, one of her arms flew up into the air.

Yang Ye was about to attack when Nansi Yin suddenly appeared before him, “You can’t kill her!”

Yang Ye frowned. He was about to speak when Nansi Yin grabbed his arm, “Leave right now!”

Hou Qing suddenly said, “Listen to her and leave immediately! You won’t be able to kill her quickly with that bird by her side. Leave now or it’ll be extremely difficult for you to leave later.”

Hou Qing’s tone was very serious!Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Yang Ye didn’t insist, and he nodded.

Yang Ye glanced at the woman. At this moment, she was looking at him too. An instant later, Yang Ye and Nansi Yin vanished on the spot.

Once they left, she glanced at her arm and spoke softly, “The Sword Domain…”

Suddenly, a blood red triangular formation of light appeared in front of her.

The woman spoke indifferently, “You’re too late!”

…

Far away in the sky, Yang Ye shot through the sky on his sword, and Nansi Yin was by his side.

Yang Ye closed his eyes and asked inwardly, “Senior, what are Shaman Hunters?”

Hou Qing explained, “An ancient clan that’s very mysterious. My shaman race wasn’t able to determine their origins even after using every resource at our disposal. All we do know is that they are extremely hostile against our shaman race. No, I should say that their mission is to hunt the members of our shaman race.”

They specialize in hunting the shaman race! Yang Ye frowned, “Do they have some sort of deep enmity with the shaman race?”

“I don’t know!” Hou Qing continued, “The Shaman Progenitor and some others acted against them in the past, but their clan still exists until now. So, you understand why I asked you to leave immediately, right? Because you really can’t afford to offend them. At the very least, you can’t afford to offend them right now.”

Yang Ye said, “I don’t want to offend them, they want to offend me!”

Hou Qing said, “Kid, it’s best to make compromises when facing them. Otherwise, once you kill one of them, you’ll be pursued endlessly. I’m not joking. Even offending the Sovereign of Man is better than offending them. Otherwise…”

Yang Ye said, “Senior, I don’t want to offend them. Didn’t you see? They want to kill me!”

Hou Qing fell silent for a short while and said, “If you can’t afford to offend them, you can avoid them, right?”

Yang Ye shook his head. Hide from them? It won’t solve anything! The only way to solve problems is the fist! Only strength can resolve problems!

Reason with them?

Of course that was possible. But it was under the circumstances that one possessed sufficient strength.

Just think about it. Would an elephant ever reason with an ant?

As if he knew what Yang Ye was thinking, Hou Qing added, “Kid, you must realize that you really don’t have the strength to fight the Shaman Hunter Clan right now. Isn’t there a saying in the human race? A moment of forbearance brings a lifetime of peace!”

Yang Ye grinned, “Let’s not talk about that. Now, let’s rush to the Shaman Dimension!”

“Right, to the Shaman Dimension!” Hou Qing continued, “Even though the Shaman Hunter Clan is mysterious and powerful, so long as you go to the Shaman Dimension, they will be helpless against you. They don’t have the ability to cause trouble in the Shaman Dimension!”

Yang Ye nodded and restrained his thoughts.

In the outside world, as soon as Yang Ye opened his eyes, he saw a pair of eyes looking at him. Their owner was Nansi Yin, of course.

Yang Ye asked, “What are you looking at?”

She sized up Yang Ye and replied, “Do you really have the shaman race’s bloodline?”

Yang Ye nodded, “What? You’re afraid?”

Nansi Yin shook her head, “I’m not afraid. But… but you’re definitely going to die. Do you know who was the one who tried to kill you? Someone from the Shaman Hunter Clan. They’re extremely terrifying. The Sovereign of Man once recruited an expert from the shaman race, but in the end, that fellow died. The Sovereign of Man sealed off all information about it, so outsiders aren’t aware of it. However, I know that he was killed by the Shaman Hunter Clan!”

Yang Ye asked, “And?”

Nansi Yin replied, “Even though the Shaman Hunter Clan is very powerful, my clan doesn’t fear them. So, come back home with me. My clan needs a guard. Help us with that and I’ll keep you alive, alright?”

Yang Ye was about to speak when a terrifying aura appeared far away in the sky.

“They’re back!” Nansi Yin smiled, “You still have time to agree right now!”

Yang Ye ignored her and looked up at the sky. Meanwhile, Hou Qing said, “Retreat for now!”

Yang Ye shook his head, took a deep breath, and then looked up into the sky. A vicious glow flashed through his eyes, “Do you really fucking think I’m that easy to bully!”

A sword howl suddenly resounded from Yang Ye’s sword!
