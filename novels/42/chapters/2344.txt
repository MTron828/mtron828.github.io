Chapter 2345 – Overbearing!

In the Primordial Pagoda, Tian Xiu sat cross-legged with her eyes closed.

Just like that, a long time passed before she opened them slowly and gazed at Yang Ye, “Come with me!”

She left the Primordial Pagoda once she finished speaking.

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and left as well.

At the peak of the mountain, Tian Xiu walked to its edge and looked up at the sky, “You have two paths. One, I send you away from Eternal Border, and you never step foot in here until you’ve attained the Limitbreaker Realm. Two, send Snowy away, far, far away.”

Yang Ye frowned and was puzzled, “Why?”

Tian Xiu replied softly, “Snowy may be able to advance.”

Yang Ye was still puzzled, “Then why should she be sent away?”

Tian Xiu gazed at Yang Ye, “If she advances, she’ll arrive at an extremely terrifying level, and you don’t have the ability to protect her. Or to be more precise, she’ll be fine, but you won’t.”

Yang Ye spoke solemnly, “It’s very serious?”

Tian Xiu replied, “It’s not very serious, it’s extremely serious. You came here from the large universe, so you’ve never heard of a Sprite Progenitor and don’t know how special she is. It can be said that a Sprite Lord that will become a Sprite Progenitor can make countless experts go mad. Even I am probably unable to stop those experts.”

Yang Ye’s face became absolutely solemn.

At this moment, he’d realized how serious the situation was.

Tian Xiu walked over to Yang Ye, “You can’t protect her with your current strength.”

She looked up at the sky and continued, “If it’s up to me, you should give her up. Because even if you flee, you’ll be running all your life. Your life has never been easy since you started cultivating, so it’s really…”

Yang Ye laughed bitterly, “Tian Xiu, do you think I would give her up?”

Tian Xiu fell silent.

Yang Ye spoke softly, “I can’t give up anyone by my side, including Snowy.”

Tian Xiu closed her eyes slowly.

How could she not be aware of Yang Ye and Snowy’s relationship? It was impossible to make Yang Ye abandon Snowy. However, if he didn’t, the consequence was bound to be bad.

After all, Snowy wasn’t a true Sprite Progenitor yet. So not to mention protecting Yang Ye, she couldn’t even protect herself. If she fell into the hands of someone else, she would be like a powerful official who relied on the King to give orders to the marquises.

She would become someone else’s puppet!

Flee?

The universe was boundless, so it was an option. However, she was very well aware that they would absolutely not give up on Snowy. No matter where Yang Ye went, they would go after him!

A long time passed before Tian Xiu opened her eyes, “What do you plan to do?”

Obviously, she was asking Yang Ye.

What should he do?

Yang Ye was stunned for a while, but it didn’t take long for him to chuckle. He chuckled for a while before he looked up at the sky with an icy cold gaze, “Tian Xiu, I want to become strong, much stronger, even stronger than you, even stronger than the Unfettered One. I want the world to cower when they hear my name, and I want no one in this world to ever dare think about targeting me. I want their hearts to shudder upon hearing my name!”

He turned to look at Tian Xiu at this point, “I want to be invincible, truly invincible!”

Invincible!

Yang Ye had finally truly understood something. If he wanted to live as he pleased, he had to be invincible. When he was truly unmatched, no one would dare to target him or his loved ones.

Bang!

A wave of powerful intent suddenly swept out from within Yang Ye.

Sword intent!

It swept out of Yang Ye and rippled toward the surroundings. A short while later, the space throughout the sky started rippling like water.

Moreover, his sword intent was soundlessly undergoing some sort of change!

A profound change!

A long time passed before it surged back into him.

Yang Ye was stunned and gazed at Tian Xiu. The latter patted him lightly on the shoulder, “I finally know why he thinks so highly of you!”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “He?”

“The sword cultivator!” Tian Xiu spoke softly, “The emotionless Sword Dao stresses upon abandoning everything except the sword. His heart belongs solely to the sword, and his world only has the sword in it. It’s a path that’s much easier than the Sword Dao of emotion. Because the Sword Dao of emotion requires you to experience life and death, you must experience everything. The path of emotion includes everything and the Laws of all things, so it isn’t that easily taken. But the emotionless path… A person who is emotionless isn’t terrifying, but if a person has emotion, that is the rarest quality.”

She sat down slowly at this point, “The heart. How many people once suffered and grew old with their children; how many lived dazzling lives and always abandoned the old for the new; and how many are willing to even kill their loved ones for their own interests and the path of immortality?”

Yang Ye fell silent. He’d experienced quite a bit of the coldness of man all through his journey.

Tian Xiu continued, “Do you know why your sword intent suddenly underwent that change?”

Yang Ye shook his head.

Tian Xiu gazed at him with gentleness in her eyes, “Those words you spoke were heartfelt. Invincibility, you want to be invincible, and the reason for that is because you want to protect those close to you. You’ve never stopped keeping them as the priority in your heart. Congratulations, your Sword Dao of Emotion has finally gotten on track. Sword cultivators actually cultivate the heart. As the heart changes, so does the sword.”

Yang Ye spoke solemnly, “It didn’t attain the True Dao Realm!”

“You’re wrong!” Tian Xiu said, “It’s like the return of the prodigal son. At that time, it’s naturally impossible for him to undergo a tremendous change. But his heart has changed. Once the heart changes, his future path changes. Your sword was once a sword of defending, and defending is always a little passive. Yet now, you want to be invincible. Can’t you feel it? Your sword intent has gained a powerful offensive attribute without you realizing it!”

She glanced at him at this point, and then he spoke softly, “The true heart of the strong.”

Offensive?

Yang Ye immediately released his sword intent, and then the space in the surroundings started rippling once more.

He hadn’t ordered the sword intent to do anything, and it was doing it on its own!

“Come with me!” Tian Xiu transformed into a ray of dark light that shot up into the sky, and it only took a moment for her to vanish in the boundless starry sky.

Yang Ye didn’t hesitate to follow her.

Far away in space, Tian Xiu and Yang Ye stood in the starry sky while countless stars surrounded them.

Tian Xiu looked Yang Ye in the eyes, “The True Dao Realm required a true Dao, and it’s the same for sword intent. Why isn’t your sword intent true? Now, calm down and think. I guarantee that no one will interrupt you.”

Thinking was comprehension!

Tian Xiu was very well aware of Yang Ye’s flaws, it was that he rarely comprehended. Yang Ye killed all his way here, and while such tempering wasn’t a bad thing for him because it made his combat instinct and ruthlessness incomparable by anyone at his age, cultivation wasn’t all about fighting and killing. Experiencing something for yourself was better than reading a thousand books, but if a person doesn’t even read a single book, then that person would be illiterate regardless of how much that person has experienced!

Experience was necessary, but reading was important too.

Now, she wanted him to comprehend!

Calm down and comprehend his own Dao, and comprehend everything in the world.

In the past, Yang Ye was either killing or on the way to kill. He was too busy and didn’t have time to comprehend. Yet now, Tian Xiu was acting as his bodyguard so he could comprehend in peace!

Tian Xiu said, “I sense another powerful intent within you, and it should be True Dao Realm madness intent. Why were you able to comprehend it? And even allow it to attain the True Dao Realm? It was because your hatred was true, your madness was true, and your insanity was true. Just like a piece of ice, what is it in essence? It is water. Water is its true form. Understand?”

Yang Ye didn’t say anything and just closed his eyes slowly.

Meanwhile, Oxxy, Snowy, Wang Erya, and Sword Scroll appeared by his side.

Tian Xiu had called them out!

Tian Xiu glanced at them. In the end, her gaze descended upon Wang Erya, and then it didn’t take long for her to frown.

Wang Erya glanced at Tian Xiu and spoke softly, “Big… Big Sis…”

She’d met many experts like the Primal Demon, but only three had ever felt extremely dangerous to her. Two of them were the sword cultivator she’d met in the village that day and Tian Xiu who stood before her!

Tian Xiu glanced at Wang Erya and nodded slightly, “Stop playing around with Snowy all day and cultivate more. Strive to stimulate your bloodline as soon as possible.”

Wang Erya was clearly quite afraid of Tian Xiu and immediately nodded, “Alright.”

Snowy blinked. Playing around?

Tian Xiu gazed at Sword Scroll, and the latter glanced at Tian Xiu. She didn’t say anything. She’d seen the world, so she was very calm when facing Tian Xiu.

Tian Xiu suddenly asked, “Because of her?”

Sword Scroll hesitated for a moment and said, “Not entirely. He’s not bad either, right?”

Tian Xiu’s face eased up quite a bit, “He’s a pretty good person, and he won’t let you down.”

Sword Scroll glanced at Tian Xiu and didn’t say a word.

Meanwhile, Tian Xiu gazed at the Sword Gourd on Snowy’s waist. Snowy blinked and passed it to her. She was very obedient at most times.

There were three people she couldn’t offend. One was Yang Ye, then it was Zi’er, and then Tian Xiu.

Tian Xiu was about to grab it, but it shook violently and transformed into a ray of light that dodged to the side.Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

However, Tian Xiu grabbed at it, and it fell into her grasp in the end.

Tian Xiu sized up the Sword Gourd and said, “You are a pretty good treasure for him. Unfortunately, you’re too proud. You’re lucky his temper isn’t that bad. If it were me, I would have blasted you into bits!”

As soon as she finished speaking, she casually tossed it aside.

His temper isn’t bad?

Sword Scroll and Wang Erya had quite strange expressions on their faces. Yang Ye’s temper isn’t bad?

Snowy hurriedly nodded instead to display her agreement. Yang Ye’s temper was quite bad. Because Yang Ye’s temper never flared against her!

Meanwhile, Tian Xiu suddenly vanished.

At the 7th level of the Primordial Pagoda.

In the void, an ethereal axe floated silently in the sky.

Tian Xiu glanced at the axe and said, “You could have escaped a long time ago, yet you’re staying here. Why? You think he’ll drag you down with him? Or perhaps your target is Snowy, and you plan to take advantage of the situation in the end?”

The axe remained silent.

Tian Xiu raised three fingers, “At the moment my last finger drops, and I still don’t get a good answer, then I’ll make you stay here forever.”

Bang!

The entire 7th level shook!

A powerful wave of pressure appeared here.

Tian Xiu’s eyes narrowed slightly, “Try it. See if I dare to crush your spirit and turn you into a pile of scrap!”
