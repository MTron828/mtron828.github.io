Chapter 1986 – No Fear of Death!

Countless demon beasts surrounded them in numerous layers.

As they gazed at the dense ocean of demon beast, not a trace of hope could be seen in their eyes. Not to mention them, even 10 Zen Realm experts would probably be unable to overcome so many demon beasts.

“Are you giving up?” Suddenly, Yang Ye’s voice resounded.

Everyone gazed at him.

Yang Ye flipped his palm, and a streamer appeared in his grasp. Yang Ye glanced at them and said, “Don’t give up until the last moment! Come with me and kill our way out!”

Yang Ye’s figure shot up into the sky, and then the remaining profound energy in him surged out. Countless strands of profound energy entered the streamer in his grasp, and then it started trembling violently.

Yang Ye waved it downwards, “Get the fuck out here!”

Swish! Swish! Swish!

Souls surged out from the streamer like a torrent. As soon as they appeared here, the skin dimmed down. The souls pounced on the demon beasts in the surroundings, and howls of pain resounded incessantly.

Qin Chuan and the others’ eyes blazed once more with hope when they witnessed this.

Qin Chuan howled with fury, “Kill them!”

“Kill them!” All the others howled with fury too!

Yang Ye led them forward like a sharp sword that was piercing through the ocean of demon beasts.

Yang Ye flew on his sword while waving the streamer through the air, and A’Man was by his side.

A’Man suddenly said, “Head to Southern Qilin Mountain!”

“Southern Qilin Mountain?” Yang Ye was puzzled, “Why?”

A’Man explained, “That’s the only place we can go. Many groups and organizations have joined forces there, and there are even some mysterious forces there. We can only deal with these demon beasts by joining forces with them!”

Yang Ye nodded, “Alright!”

At the same time, he sized up A’Man and asked, “Are you alright?”

At this moment, besides a ghastly countenance, her entire body was covered in blood.

She shook her head slightly, “It’s nothing.”

Yang Ye nodded slightly, and then he didn’t say another word. He turned around and waved the streamer madly. More and more souls appeared here, and they were filled with the viciousness and the intent to kill. Once they appeared here, they immediately pounced at the demon beasts in the surroundings.

Compared to those demon beasts, the souls still seemed quite insufficient. Especially when facing some of the formidable demon beasts, a huge group of souls were instantly slapped into bits. Fortunately, the charge of these souls made things easier for Yang Ye’s group.

They traveled all the way south!

However, the demon beasts had no intention to let them go, and they kept chasing after Yang Ye’s group.

Two hours later, fewer and fewer souls remained in the surroundings, but the demon beasts hadn’t really reduced in number, and they were growing in number instead.

As for Yang Ye’s group, it was growing smaller as well. Now, there were less than 50 of them left!

Genius after genius were perishing!

At the front of the group, Yang Ye held the streamer tightly while a gloomy expression covered his face. Because if this continued, there would probably be no one left behind him when they arrived at Southern Qilin Mountain!

A’Man asked, “Do you have any ideas?”

Ideas? A wisp of bitterness arose on the corners of Yang Ye’s mouth. What ideas could he possibly have to deal with this boundless ocean of demon beasts? The Invincible Sword Domain and the streamer had been used, but he was still unable to resolve the problem they faced.

Even though he had no other ideas, he would never give up!

Yang Ye asked, “How far are we from Southern Qilin Mountain?”

A’Man replied, “Around four hours!

Four hours! Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings, and then he said, “There’s no other way! We can only go head-on against them!”

As soon as he finished speaking, faint golden light appeared around Yang Ye.

The Gold Form!

At this moment, he had no other choice but to go head-on against them.

“Just leave by yourself!” Suddenly, A’Man spoke softly to him, “Based on your strength, you have a huge chance of being able to charge out of here. But you probably won’t be able to leave if you stay with us!”

Yang Ye turned to look at A’Man, “Big Sis, I don’t like hearing that. If I wanted to leave on my own, I wouldn’t have come back. In my life, I’ve never betrayed those who haven’t betrayed me.”

He glanced at the others and said, “We’ll either get out of this together or die together!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he turned around and swung his sword.

Hiss!

A ray of sword energy flashed. A few demon beasts ahead were instantly sliced into two.

Roar!

Suddenly, the demon beasts in front of them moved to the side, and then a demon beast that seemed like a lion covered in dark red flames dashed towards them.

“The Flare Lion!” A’Man spoke solemnly, “It’s comparable to an Attain Dao Realm expert. I was no match for it when I went head-on against it earlier.”

It’s comparable to an Attain Dao Realm expert! Yang Ye tightened his grip on his sword, and then he stretched his hand forward. His sword immediately floated above his palm, and it started to spin rapidly.

The Flare Lion was getting closer and closer to Yang Ye’s group, and all of them felt a wave of pressure slam down upon them!

Yang Ye closed his eyes slowly.

Swish!

Yang Ye’s sword vanished abruptly, and a ray of light flashed.

Burial!

Yang Ye didn’t dare to hold back at all against a demon beast at this level, and he couldn’t hold back either. Because if they were stopped here for just a moment, it would be extremely disadvantageous to them. He had to end the battle quickly!

The Flare Lion stopped, and then numerous gashes appeared on its body before blood sprayed out like fountains.

The Flare Lion moved backwards rapidly while blood sprayed all over the ground.

It had survived Yang Ye’s attack. However, it was heavily injured, and it didn’t have much strength left to fight.

Yang Ye ignored it and led the others towards the Southern Qilin Mountain!

Roar!

Suddenly, a furious roar resounded from behind the demon beasts. In an instant, all of them chased after Yang Ye’s group.

Yang Ye glanced in the direction of the roar. At the center of the ocean of demon beasts was a demon beast, and it was looking at them. It had the body of a person and the head of an ox, and it was extremely huge.

At this moment, it was looking at their group.

Yang Ye knew that it was probably the leader of these demon beasts, and if he could kill it, then the army of demon beasts around him would definitely collapse. However, while it was a great idea, reality was cruel!

Demon beasts respected the strong. Since it could give orders to all the demon beasts here, its strength was obvious. Besides that, if he wanted to kill it, he would have to face it, and that was another problem.

Flee!

Yang Ye discarded that unrealistic thought and didn’t stop fleeing!

Around two hours later, less than 40 were left from the 50 plus they had been just two hours ago. More than 10 had fallen to the boundless ocean of demon beasts.

Yang Ye and the others’ expressions grew even gloomier.

At this moment, Yang Ye’s body was covered in injuries, and his countenance was horribly pale. The continuous battle had pushed his body to an extremely exhausted state.

As for the others behind him, practically none of them was whole.

However, something worth mentioning was that the sky race’s Yu Jing, the clean freak, was still so clean and dignified. There wasn’t even a drop of blood on him.

Suddenly, A’Man said, “Look! In front of us!”

Yang Ye looked up, and he saw two towering mountains in the distance. The mountains were close together, and there was only a path around 300m between them. It was like a door.

Yang Ye understood what A’Man meant! Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Yang Ye and the others sped up, and it didn’t take long for them to go through that path. However, Yang Ye and A’Man stopped at this point. As soon as they stopped, the others stopped too, and then they gazed at Yang Ye and A’Man!

Meanwhile, A’Man suddenly spoke in an indisputable tone, “I’ll stay behind!”

Yang Ye shook his head, “Let me!”

A'Man walked over to Yang Ye, “There’s no time. Take them and go! Right now!”

Yang Ye was about to speak when A’Man grabbed his shirt and lifted him up, “It isn’t the time to hesitate. I asked you to go, so go! Otherwise, everyone will die here! Understand?”

Now, all of them understood what Yang Ye and A’Man were talking about.

The demon beasts couldn’t swarm them here. Moreover, based on the size of those demon beasts, only around two or three would be able to enter the path at once. That was an opportunity for them, an opportunity for them to flee. However, someone had to stay behind and buy time for them.

Otherwise, no one would be able to escape!

As for the person who stayed behind, that person had to be strong. Only then could that person keep the demon beasts at bay and buy time for them.

Strength!

Only Yang Ye and A’Man possessed such strength!

Yang Ye spoke solemnly, “Big Sis, let me stay. Trust me, I’ll be able to escape!”

“Escape?” A’Man spoke angrily, “How? Can you defy the heavens?” She tried her best to calm down at this point and continued, “Take them to Southern Qilin Mountain. They need a strong and courageous leader. Otherwise, it’ll be very difficult for them to survive in this chaotic place. I’m begging you, alright?”

All of them fell silent.

The demon beasts were getting closer, and they would get before them in 10 breaths of time at most!

Suddenly, Yang Ye started laughing, and then he gazed at Qin Chuan and the others, “She intends to sacrifice herself so we can escape. Tell me, are you willing to let that happen?”

Qin Chuan chuckled. He glanced at his right shoulder, but there was nothing there. He’d actually lost both his arms earlier.

Qin Chuan said, “Even though it doesn’t feel nice to have lost my arms, it isn’t too bad. However, if we have to exchange A’Man’s life for us to survive, then I would never be able to rest at ease!”

Ling, who was so weak that he couldn’t even stand firmly, said, “Me too!”

Mad Saber placed his saber against his shoulder, “Isn’t it just death? Since we dared to come here, we don’t fear death!”

Yu Jing suddenly said, “Brother Yang, can you promise me something?”

Everyone gazed at him. At this moment, Yu Ling didn’t have half his head.

Yu Jing cracked a smile, “If I die, give me a change of clean clothes.”
