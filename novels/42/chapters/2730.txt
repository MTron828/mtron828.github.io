Chapter 2731 – Run!

They’d almost been killed in battle just now, yet Erya wanted more of it!

Yang Ye laughed bitterly.

Yang Ye estimated Erya’s strength, and he found that her strength should be on par with An Nanjing and him. But if her abnormal defensive capabilities were included, then she may be slightly stronger than them!

As for killing the giant on her own, she actually hadn’t done so at all. After all, it had been fighting him and An Nanjing for a long time. It could be said that the giant was already weakened, and Erya just took advantage of its weakness.

Of course, Erya’s terrifying strength was beyond doubt.

Meanwhile, An Nanjing suddenly asked, “How do we find them?”

Yang Ye fell silent.

How to find Qi Bitian and Tian Xiu?

It was a huge problem!

He didn’t know the Four Dimensional Universe at all, so how would he find them?

Snowy!

Yang Ye’s eyes suddenly lit up, and he quickly summoned Snowy. Snowy was still snoring, and she was quite displeased when Yang Ye woke her up. So, she kept rubbing her head against Yang Ye’s head.

She wanted to sleep!

Yang Ye smiled embarrassedly and said, “Snowy, stop sleeping for now and help me with something.”

Snowy rubbed her drowsy eyes and gazed at him.

Yang Ye smiled, “Can you contact Tian Xiu?”

He knew that the little fellow was very close to Tian Xiu. After all, she’d summoned Tian Xiu that day in the Origin World!

Snowy blinked when she heard him. Summon Tian Xiu!

Snowy glanced at the surroundings, and then she closed her eyes slowly.Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Around 15 minutes later, Snowy opened her eyes and pointed into the distance.

Yang Ye asked, “Over there?”

Snowy nodded and started waving her paws.

A short while later, Yang Ye understood. Snowy was telling him that she could sense Tian Xiu’s aura, but she couldn’t contact Tian Xiu. As for the reason, it was because she couldn’t sense spirit energy which was too far away!

Too far away!

Her method of locating people was with spirit energy. She sensed spirit energy and used it to search for the person she was looking for or use Profound Energy to send a message…

Needless to say, it was an extremely terrifying ability!

At the very least, Yang Ye couldn’t accomplish it!

Yang Ye gazed in the direction Snowy had pointed toward. It was just boundless space that had no end to it.

Yang Ye fell silent for a moment and said, “Let’s go!”

Snowy nodded. Meanwhile, An Nanjing appeared before her and gazed at her, “Why don’t you speak?”

Snowy blinked, opened her mouth, and words came out of it.

I can!

But it was without sound.

An Nanjing shook her head and left.

Yang Ye chuckled and followed her with Snowy.

Actually, he’d asked Snowy about it a long time ago. Snowy could speak, but the way she spoke was unlike humans. She was the Good Sprite, and the Good Sprite had its own method of communication!

Asking Snowy to speak was like asking a human to speak the language of animals… So, asking a human why they couldn’t speak the animal tongue would be a stupid question. The only reason she could mouth the words was actually because she’d been with Yang Ye for so long, and she understood the human tongue.

Actually, maybe it was because she didn’t really like to speak the human tongue, just like Yang Ye wasn’t really willing to speak in the way demon beasts and animals spoke.

Of course, it wasn’t a big deal!

Yang Ye held Snowy in his arms as he continued forward with An Nanjing.

Yang Ye had a solemn expression on his face as he traveled through the boundless reaches of space. Because everything here was unknown to him, and he didn’t know what was waiting ahead!

No matter what, he had to find Tian Xiu and Qi Bitian.

After he found them, the first thing would be to take them with him and annihilate End World, and then fight the strongest form of Destiny!

His current strength was utterly incapable of annihilating the End World!

Besides that, he had to warm them about the strongest form of Destiny and tell them to be careful.

A long time passed before they stopped.

There was a strange black vortex before them.

Yang Ye and An Nanjing exchanged glances, and then they chose to go around it. However, something unexpected happened. The vortex instantly expanded and approached them rapidly!

Yang Ye frowned slightly, “What the heck is that?”

Yang Ye didn’t dare act carelessly and kept retreating with An Nanjing. However, the black vortex had locked onto them and was trying to devour them!

Yang Ye waved his hand and an expanse of sword energy shot at the black vortex!

However, the sword energy was completely devoured before it could even approach the black vortex.

“What the heck is this?” Yang Ye’s face turned gloomy as he continued retreating with An Nanjing.

Suddenly, Snowy appeared on Yang Ye’s shoulder. She glanced at the black vortex and waved her Sprite Staff. In an instant, countless strands of spirit energy surrounded the black vortex. But in just an instant, the black vortex devoured all the spirit energy!

Snowy was stunned.

It just vanished?

“Roar!” Suddenly, a furious roar resounded from the black vortex, and then the vortex started devouring even more quickly and madly than before!

Yang Ye’s expression changed drastically, and he retreated with An Nanjing again.

Meanwhile, Snowy blinked, took a peek at the black vortex, and was quite puzzled.

Why didn’t it work?

A moment later, she waved her paws quickly. Countless strands of spirit energy rapidly converged at the pitch black vortex. This time, the black vortex suddenly stopped.

It’s working?

Snowy blinked and had a brilliant smile on her face. But just a moment later, the black vortex spun rapidly, and then Yang Ye and An Nanjing watched with astonishment as it devoured all the spirit energy Snowy had converged there!

After that, a powerful aura rippled out of it!

Yang Ye spoke solemnly, “It’s devouring the spirit energy and growing stronger!”

An Nanjing glanced at Snowy. She was telling Snowy that it was all Snowy’s fault!

Snowy blinked, and then she covered her eyes. After that, she fled back into the Primordial Pagoda.

It was such an embarrassment!

Outside the Primordial Pagoda, Yang Ye and An Nanjing’s expressions were quite unsightly.

What do we do?

The answer was run, of course!
