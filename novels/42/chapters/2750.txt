Chapter 2751 – The Yang Clan!

It was quite aggrieving for Yang Ye. The mysterious expert didn’t just have the End World by his side, he had so many other ancient existences from Destiny’s era!

It was like a never-ending battle!

A short while later, Yang Ye felt quite embarrassed!

Because it seemed like he really didn’t have anyone to call for help!

Destiny?

It may not work. Because if she could come, she would be here by now.

Tian Xiu and Little Qi?

He didn’t even know where they were!

Yang Ye shook his head and sighed. He didn’t have anyone to call on and could only rely on himself!

Right when Yang Ye and An Nanjing were about to attack, a shadow descended before Shu Wubian.

It was the mysterious expert!Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Meanwhile, Yang Busi appeared before Yang Ye.

The mysterious expert and Shu Wubian’s bodies suddenly started turning ethereal. Meanwhile, a pitch black vortex appeared behind them, and the remaining experts of the End World vanished as well!

Yang Ye was about to give chase, but Yang Busi stopped him!

Yang Ye gazed at her, and she shook her head slightly, “You’re no match for him!”

Yang Ye spoke solemnly, “Who is he?”

Yang Busi fell silent.

Yang Ye spoke softly, “You can’t say?”

Yang Busi shook her head, “I’m not sure either. No matter what, he isn’t someone you can fight. He had numerous trump cards, so he should have been planning this for countless years. If I hadn’t come here today, he wouldn’t have exposed so many of his trump cards. And it’s obvious that he still has more trump cards!”

She looked up at the distant sky, “His target is Destiny!”

Destiny!

Yang Ye fell silent.

He thought of the strongest form of Destiny again!

What the heck had she done…?

Meanwhile, Yang Busi said, “He doesn’t dare to reveal his main body or all his trump cards because he’s keeping an extremely formidable trump card for Destiny. If he exposes it now, he's afraid that Destiny would find out about it…”

She gazed at Yang Ye, “You should feel lucky. Because if you were his target, you would have no chance to survive.”

Yang Ye shook his head and smiled, “Anyway, what are you doing back here?”

She replied indifferently, “I never left.”

Yang Ye was quite puzzled, “Why?”

She looked into the distance, “I sensed his presence that day, and he kept feigning weakness in battle against me. I knew that he wanted me to get careless and leave. Of course, you and the Yang Clan aren’t the only reason I stayed, I wanted to find out who he was!”

Yang Ye looked into the distance, “Since we failed to annihilate them today, it’ll probably be even more difficult next time!”

Yang Busi glanced at Yang Ye, “Do you really want to annihilate them?”

Yang Ye nodded, “Of course!”

Yang Busi fell silent for a moment and said, “Your current strength is insufficient. The Destiny Realm was set by Destiny, and it’s a boundary. A boundary that cannot be surpassed. As far as we are concerned, it’s a boundary that must be surpassed. So, during our era, anyone who attained… Anyone who attained my level would be considered to be at the Destiny Transcendence Realm.”

She gazed at Yang Ye and continued, “Since the ancient times, there may have been less than 10 humans who have been able to attain this realm. And more than 70% of them are dead now. Only by transcending the realm of cultivation set by Destiny can one truly fight her. Otherwise, anyone at the Destiny Realm or below are just ants to her.”

The Destiny Transcendence Realm!

Yang Ye spoke softly, “Is that the highest known realm of cultivation?”

Yang Busi spoke softly, “Sort of. At the very least, I haven’t seen anyone who has attained a higher breakthrough or discovery. Of course, the complete form of Destiny is an exception. She is an existence that no one knows about. She can be said to be leading in the path of cultivation within our Three Dimensional Universe. If you want to know what the limits of cultivation are, defeat her, and you will find out.”

Yang Ye nodded slightly, “I will!”

Yang Busi suddenly glanced at him upon hearing this. Yang Ye had spoken very calmly, but it had been very serious too. It didn’t seem like he was joking at all!

There was a wisp of admiration in Yang Busi’s eyes. She patted him on the shoulder, “Very good! As expected of someone from my Yang Clan! You have courage!”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

Meanwhile, the others from the Yang Clan came over to Yang Busi and Yang Ye. The grand elder led everyone to kneel before them, but Yang Busi waved her hand and stopped them.

Yang Busi said, “You’re all members of my Yang Clan. While there’s a difference in rank within the clan, it isn’t differentiated by kneeling. Moreover, all that matters is that you hold respect in your hearts! Forget all of these things that are just for show!”

The grand elder hurriedly said, “Yes, you’re absolutely correct, Ancestor!”

Besides Yang Ye, no one else in the Yang Clan wasn’t excited and nervous when facing Yang Busi. It couldn’t be helped, she was a legendary figure of the clan, and the founder of the Yang Clan!

She was the one who’d created the glory of the Yang Clan!

Yang Busi continued, “All those years ago, it was strength and unity that allowed our Yang Clan to make the universe acknowledge us as the tenth clan. Now, since this kid is my Yang Clan’s patriarch, you must assist him well. Don’t start cooking up schemes, understand?”

The grand elder hurriedly said, “We will remember your words well, Ancestor.”

Yang Busi nodded and gazed at Yang Ye, “I’m really leaving this time. It’s time to gradually get even for some things.”

Yang Ye fell silent for a short moment and said, “See you next time then, Senior.”

He knew that he couldn’t make Yang Busi stay. If it was the Yang Clan of the past, she may stay behind to protect it. Yet now… He could sense that her heart wasn’t with the Yang Clan!

She’d given up too, too much for the Yang Clan all those years ago. Now, she wanted to do some things for herself!

Yang Busi wasn’t an indecisive person. She patted Yang Ye on the shoulder, “I don’t hope for the Yang Clan to reign supreme over the universe, all I do hope is that no one dares to bully the Yang Clan. I’m counting on you!”

She vanished into the sky once she finished speaking.

Yang Ye looked up in that direction. A figure was ceaselessly tearing through space… A short while later, a huge hole had been torn open there, and then Yang Busi’s figure vanished completely.

This time, she’d really left!

Yang Ye gazed at the spatial rift there in silence.
