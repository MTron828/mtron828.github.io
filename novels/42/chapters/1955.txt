Chapter 1956 – Night Watch!

Yang Ye gazed at the man again. The latter seemed to have noticed Yang Ye’s gaze and looked at him.

The Mad Saver merely glanced at Yang Ye before moving his gaze away.

“There’s one more guy!” Suddenly, Qin Chuan pointed towards his left, “See that fellow covered in spirit energy?”

Yang Ye looked along Qin Chuan’s gaze. There was a man in a moon white robe there. The man was very young and around Yang Ye’s age, and the man was covered in a white mist.

“He’s from the spirit race!” Qin Chuan continued, “That fellow’s very cold too. He doesn’t speak to anyone except A’Man.”

Yang Ye asked, “A’Man bashed both of them up?”

Qin Chuan chuckled, “Of course. However, she’s very serious when dealing with them. In short, they’re the strongest here besides her. Don’t offend them, and they will definitely not come for you. As for A’Man, she’s usually very easy to get along with!”

Yang Ye nodded slightly, “Thanks. Right, you’re the junior city governor here?”

Qin Chuan nodded and smiled, “It isn’t because of my strength, it’s because of my social ability. We need someone to liven up the atmosphere and deal with miscellaneous matters. So, A’Man made it sound good by calling me the Junior City Governor! Actually, it’s a completely useless title!”

He seemed to have thought of something at this point and added, “Right, I forgot to ask. Did you come here on your own accord, or…?”

Yang Ye replied, “I was forced to come here!”

“You were?” Qin Chuan was stunned, and then he asked, “What do you mean?”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and replied, “Many people wanted to kill me. So, I had no choice but to come here and lay low.”

Qin Chuan nodded slightly, “I thought you came here on your own accord. So, how’d the world outside? Has our human race entered into war with the shaman race?”

Yang Ye shook his head slightly, “No.”

Qin Chuan sighed, “If that happens, who knows how many people from both sides will die!”

Yang Ye nodded, “True!”

After a short chat with Qin Chuan, Yang Ye sat down cross-legged and immersed his mind into the Primordial Pagoda.

“Kid, there’s something off about that little girl!” Suddenly, Hou Qing appeared before Yang Ye and spoke in a low voice.

Yang Ye was slightly stunned, and it didn’t take long for him to understand who Hou Qing was talking about.

Zhi’er!

Hou Qing was speaking about Zhi’er! ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Yang Ye asked, “What happened?”

Hou Qing gazed at Yang Ye, “She’s at the peak of the Rebirth Realm now, and she’s only a step away from the True Realm.”

The peak of the Rebirth Realm!

An extremely solemn expression appeared on Yang Ye’s face. After all, she hadn’t cultivated at all before meeting him. Yet now, she was at the peak of the Rebirth Realm!

Such speed…

A short while later, Yang Ye and Hou Qing went to her. Just like before, she seemed quite timid.

Yang Ye sized up the little girl before him, and then he gazed at Hou Qing, “Senior, is she a true extraordinary genius, or is there some other reason?”

“There’s definitely another reason!” Hou Qing spoke solemnly, “It’s impossible for a normal person to be this quick. But I’m unable to discern what’s unusual about her.”

Something was unusual!

Yang Ye sized her up carefully. Just as Hou Qing had said, she seemed very normal, extremely even.

Is she really just an extraordinary genius?

“Big Brother…” Meanwhile, she suddenly spoke softly, “What… what is it?”

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts and said, “Have you noticed anything off while you cultivated?”

“Something off?” She looked up at Yang Ye with a puzzled expression on her face.

Yang Ye thought for a moment and explained, “Er… What do you feel when you cultivate?”

She shook her head slightly, “I don’t feel anything. Oh, that’s not right. I feel like there’s so much spirit energy in here!”

Yang Ye asked, “The spirit energy here?”

She nodded, “Yes. I feel extremely comfortable when absorbing the spirit energy here.”

Yang Ye gazed at Hou Qing, and the latter shook his head slightly, “While the spirit energy here is rare and extremely effective, it isn’t that good.” He paused for a moment and continued, “There’s definitely something special about her physique, and we just haven’t noticed it!”

“Big Brother…” Suddenly, she spoke softly, “I…”

Yang Ye gazed at her, “What is it?”

She hesitated for a moment and spoke softly, “Some images flash through my mind. I don’t know what they are.”

Yang Ye and Hou Qing exchanged glances, and then silence filled the surroundings.

Meanwhile, she suddenly asked, “Big Brother, you won’t make me leave, right?”

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts and smiled, “Why do you ask?”

She spoke softly, “I’m afraid!”

Yang Ye rubbed her head and smiled, “So long as you don’t choose to leave, you can stay as long as you want!”

She cracked a smile, “Thank you, Big Brother!”

Yang Ye grinned and said, “Go on and play with the others!”

Zhi’er nodded slightly and vanished into the distance.

Hou Qing spoke solemnly, “She’s not ordinary at all!”

Yang Ye shook his head slightly, “It doesn’t matter. Senior, there’s something I want to ask you. Will there be any side effects from fully merging with the Sky Dragon?”

“There shouldn’t be any!” Hou Qing explained, “The Sky Dragon is considered an auspicious beast, and it won’t try to harm someone unless it’s forced to. Moreover, according to my knowledge, the Sky Emperor from all those years ago wasn’t a bad person. Besides that, you don’t have to worry about it because you have this pagoda inside you. Even if the Sky Dragon wants to harm you, it can’t do anything while you have this pagoda with you!”

Yang Ye nodded. He chatted with Hou Qing in the Primordial Pagoda for some time, and then he left.

He was naturally unable to rest at ease and cultivate within the Primordial Pagoda while he resided in the city!

Yu Jing and A’Man were back.

Yu Jing spoke solemnly to A’Man, “The devil men aren’t showing any signs of acting against us, but I heard a piece of news!”

A’Man asked, “What?”

Yu Jing replied solemnly, “The younger brother of Devil Cave’s leader has died.”

A’Man and Qin Chuan gazed at Yang Ye.

Meanwhile, Yu Jing continued, “I’m sure you’re aware how protective that fellow is, and it was even his younger brother who died. He will definitely not let the matter rest. I think that we should take precautions in advance and avoid being caught off guard!”

A’Man fell silent for a long time, and then she said, “From now onwards, don’t rashly leave the city.”

Yu Jing shrugged, “Big Sis, to be honest, we don’t have to fear those cannibals. We can just fight them!”

A'Man shook her head slightly, “Don’t forget that there’s the Dire Wolves too. Those fellows are usually very elusive, but once there’s an opportunity to seize, they’ll definitely show themselves. If we enter into battle with the Devil Cave, they are the ones who’ll benefit in the end.”

“That’s true…” Yu Jing continued, “Forget it. We’ll just do as you say.”

A’Man nodded slightly, and then she suddenly gazed at Yang Ye. At the same time, everyone gazed at him too.

A’Man said, “Introduce yourself to everyone!”

Yang Ye glanced at them and said, “Yang Ye! Human!”

Everyone glanced at Yang Ye and withdrew their gazes.

“Don’t mind them!” Qin Chuan smiled, “If you want to obtain everyone’s acknowledgement here, you must have some strength. While you’ve gained A’Man’s permission to join Sky Residence City, you have to prove your strength to obtain everyone else’s acknowledgement. That doesn’t just apply here, it applies in the outside world too. You need strength to be acknowledged by others, right?”

Yang Ye smiled, “I understand!”

Meanwhile, A’Man suddenly said, “According to the rules, you have to be on night watch tonight. Guard one section of the wall on your own. That’s not a problem, right?”

The night watch!

Qin Chuan spoke softly by Yang Ye’s side, “That’s the proof. You aren’t the only one. Everyone who just joined Sky Residence City must do this.”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and replied, “No problem!”

A’Man nodded slightly, “If you survive tonight, then you’re a member of Sky Residence City. As for the Devil Cave, you don’t have to worry about it. I’ll help you deal with them.”

A'Man turned around and went back to her spot once she finished speaking.

Many others glanced at Yang Ye and returned to their own spots.

Meanwhile, Yu Jing suddenly asked, “Big Sis, should I continue watching Devil Cave?”

A’Man shook her head slightly, and then she gazed at the black clothed man with a single arm, “Mad Saber, you go. If they take action, kill a few and return; if they don’t do anything, then just leave them alone.”

Even though the Mad Saber was deaf, he understood what she said by reading her lips. He immediately nodded and stood up. After that, Yang Ye’s face instantly became solemn for some reason!

The Mad Saber was still on the spot!

However, it wasn’t his main body. His main body had vanished a long time ago. The Mad Saber standing before them was just an afterimage that remained here because he was too swift.

Qin Chuan muttered, “That fellow has grown stronger…”

…

Time passed swiftly, and the veil of night gradually descended.

Yang Ye went to the city wall above the front gate. As for the other three sections, there were five people on each side.

But Yang Ye was all alone!

Yang Ye gazed at the sky and took a deep breath, “Bring it on!”
