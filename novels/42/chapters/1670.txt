Chapter 1671 - What Do I Have To Fear?

Translator: InVader

Yang Ru wiped off the blood on the corner of his mouth, and then he looked up at Yang Ye, “A sword soul technique. I didn’t expect you to have a move like this.”

Yang Ye spoke indifferently, “Should we continue our spar?”

Yang Ru shook his head slightly, “Let’s not waste time. We’ll meet during the competition!”

He turned around and left once he finished speaking.

Lu Yuanzhan glanced at Yang Ye’s group, “My Lu Clan doesn’t welcome your presence.”

Suddenly, a ray of light flashed.

Lu Yuanzhan’s eyes narrowed slightly as he slapped his right palm forward.

Bang!

The sword energy was dispersed but Lu Yuanzhan had been pushed over 30m away. He looked up at Yang Ye and was about to speak when Yang Ye suddenly spoke, “What? You don’t like it? Bite me!”

Lu Yuanzhan clenched his right fist. However, Yang Ru’s voice suddenly resounded from within the city, “Brother Lu, there’s no rush.”

Lu Yuanzhan glanced coldly at Yang Ye, “Just you wait!” He turned around and left.

An Nanjing asked, “Why aren’t they attacking us?”

Yang Ye laughed coldly, “Of course they aren’t. Firstly, they can’t kill us unless the True Realm experts of the Lu Clan attack as well. Secondly, it’s pointless for them to fight us to the death. Even if we die, they will suffer. Moreover, Yang Xing and I aren’t the only young masters of the Yang Clan. There are others, so he had to take precautions against them as well.”

An Nanjing nodded slightly and didn’t speak further.

Yang Ye gazed at Lu Lige, “Are you alright?”

Lu Lige rolled his eyes, “Do I look like I’m alright?”

Yang Ye glanced at Lu Lige’s abdomen and said, “I’ll find a way to repair your Dantian once we get back.”

Lu Lige nodded slightly. A shattered Dantian wasn’t a big deal in the medium universe of Milky Way System. Because there were numerous methods to repair it.

“Yang Ye!” Yang Xing spoke abruptly, “Shall we join forces?”

Yang Ye turned to look at Yang Xing, “Join forces?”

Yang Xing nodded, “We can exclude our eldest sister because she can’t participate in the fight for succession. However, our eldest brother, Yang Ru, and our ninth brother which Yang Ru mentioned aren’t easy to deal with. If we don’t join forces, we’ll have no chance against them.”

Yang Ye shook his head, “I refuse!”

Yang Xing spoke in a low voice, “Why?”

Yang Ye glanced at Yang Xing, “Because I don’t want to be stabbed in the back. Anyway, I don’t offend others unless someone offends me. So, if you don’t look for trouble with me, it’s equivalent to joining forces with me. If you come looking for trouble with me or try to play tricks, then I guarantee that you won’t have a chance to speak next time.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye and the others vanished on the spot.

Yang Xing fell silent for a long time. In the end, he gazed at Ming Mo, “Are you alright?”

Ming Mo shook his head slightly, “I’ll escort you home!”

It didn’t take long for Ming Mo and Yang Xing to vanish on the spot as well.

Once they left, Lu Yuanzhan and Yang Ru appeared at the entrance of the city.

“Why didn’t you choose to kill them?” Lu Yuanzhan spoke in a low voice, “Your strength is completely sufficient to kill them!”

Yang Ru shook his head slightly, “I can’t.”

Lu Yuanzhan gazed at Yang Ru, “You can’t?”

Yang Ru nodded, “I thought I could, but I didn’t expect Yang Ye to actually possess a sword soul technique. The combination of his slaughter intent, sword intent, and that sword soul technique are something that even I dare not act carelessly against.”

Lu Yuanzhan replied, “There are other reasons, right?”

Yang Ru nodded slightly, “Yang Ye has a wooden sword. He used it to fight a True Realm expert that day. If he uses that sword, it would be impossible for us to kill him. Even if we somehow succeed, we’ll definitely pay a terrible price.”

He looked up at the sky and continued, “Besides that, while I’m scheming against people, others are similarly scheming against me! The slightest mistake will lead to my destruction!”

Lu Yuanzhan nodded, “I understand!”

It didn’t take long for them to vanish on the spot.

Not long after they vanished, a black shadow suddenly appeared where they had been standing.

A few moments of silence ensued before the figure shook its head, “What a pity.”

The figure vanished on the spot once it finished speaking.

…

Yang Ye brought Lu Lige back to Phecda City. Even though Lu Lige was heavily injured, it wasn’t fatal. So, after receiving treatment from Yang Ye’s Primordial Violet Energy, Lu Lige was able to move now. However, he’d become an ordinary person.

After he gave Lu Lige a place to rest, he went to the Immortal Phoenix Pavilion and met Yang Xuan. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Yang Xuan asked, “You’re here for Lu Lige?”

Yang Ye glanced at her and said, “Since you’re aware, then I won’t say anything about it. Do you know how to repair his Dantian?”

He used to possess treasures that could heal the Dantian, and it was the Fruit of Creation. However, Snowy and Zi’er had treated it like snacks and eaten all of it. It wasn’t just the Fruit of Creation, all the other treasures he obtained in the past had been eaten up by them.

Both Snowy and Zi’er wouldn’t be shy when it came to his possessions!

Yang Xuan pondered deeply for a moment before flicking a pure white fruit over to Yang Ye, “A Tea Fruit. It can rebuild the Dantian.”

Yang Ye glanced at her. He didn’t refuse and took it, and then he intended to leave. However, Yang Xuan suddenly said, “The competition is in three days. Have you made your preparations?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “Prepare what? I haven’t.”

Yang Xuan spoke solemnly, “Do you realize the situation that you’re in right now?”

Yang Ye gazed at her, “Please do tell!”

She replied, “Many people in the Yang Clan want to see you dead.”

Yang Ye nodded, “I know.”

“You know?” She gazed at him, “How do you know?”

Yang Ye grinned, “Don’t worry about that. Just continue.”

Yang Xuan pondered deeply for a moment and continued, “It’s probably one of your father’s old subordinates who told you. But that’s good. It saves me the time to explain things to you. In the Yang Clan, the clan’s interests are the most important. If your potential is at a certain level, even the patriarch can dream of killing you. At the very least, it’s impossible to do so openly. Because the Council of Elders will definitely not allow it. However, the precondition is that your potential is sufficient!”

Yang Ye asked, “What sort of level is required?”

Yang Xuan spoke in a low voice, “The successor! Become the clan’s successor! So long as you become the Yang Clan’s successor, you’ll obtain the Council of Elder’s protection. Or, it should be said that so long as you become the successor, you’ll obtain the protection of most people in the Yang Clan. However, many won’t let you become the successor.”

Yang Ye asked, “Who?”

Yang Xuan replied, “Some of your father’s old subordinates. Especially those who betrayed him in the end. They are afraid that you’ll take revenge on them. While they aren’t afraid of you now, they’re afraid that you’ll try to get even with them once you take control of the Yang Clan. So, they will definitely act from the shadows!”

Yang Ye nodded, “I understand. I’ll be careful!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye turned around with the intent to leave. However, Yang Xuan said, “Remember that you and the people you care about will only be able to survive if you become the successor of the Yang Clan. Understand?”

Yang Ye took a deep and long glance at her, and then he left the room and transformed into a ray of light that vanished on the spot.

Not long after Yang Ye left, Gu Xiu and Qian Hu appeared here.

Gu Xiu glanced at Yang Xuan, “Phoenix Immortal, why did you say all of that?”

Yang Xuan spoke indifferently, “So that he’ll work hard to become the successor! Otherwise, why else would I say that?”

Gu Xiu gazed at Yang Xuan for a long time before he said, “Why do I feel like you’re warning him about something?”

Yang Xuan chuckled, “Gu Xiu, what do you think I’m warning him about? What does our master want? Our master wants Yang Ye to kill those young masters of the Yang Clan. If he doesn’t fight to be the successor, how will he kill them? Have you not realized it? He has no intention to be the successor. If he doesn’t understand the current situation which he’s in, it’s very likely that he’ll choose to withdraw right at the beginning of the competition! Right?”

Gu Xiu gazed at her for a long time and smiled, “Looks like I was overthinking.”

He paused for a moment and added, “Phoenix Commander, you should be aware of our master’s strength and potential. So, you definitely won’t do something that’s harmful to our master, right?”

Yang Xuan spoke indifferently, “What do you think?”

Gu Xiu was about to speak when Qian Hu suddenly spoke, “Let’s not waste time. He cares a lot about his loved ones. Our master wants us to capture some of his loved ones in Merak System.” She gazed at Yang Xuan and continued, “Phoenix Commander, will you go, or should we?”

Yang Xuan was about to speak when Gu Xiu suddenly said, “I think we should go ourselves.”

Qian Hu glanced at Gu Xiu and nodded, “Alright, we’ll go. I…”

Her expression suddenly changed drastically. She was about to act when a man suddenly appeared behind her, and then a sword was pressed against her throat.

It was none other than Yang Ye!

Gu Xiu and Qian Hu were shocked. They hadn’t expected Yang Ye to be hiding in the shadows!

Even Yang Xuan hadn’t expected it. She’d thought that Yang Ye had left!

Yang Ye gazed at Qian Hu, “I heard you’re going to Merak System? Why? To tour the place?”

Gu Xiu spoke in a low voice, “Yang Ye, don’t act rashly. She’s one of the seven marshals. If you kill her, you’ll definitely…”

“I’ll definitely what?” Yang Ye suddenly interrupted Gu Xiu, “I’ll definitely be punished? What do I have to fear?!”

As he spoke, he suddenly pressed down.

Hiss!

Qian Hu’s head was instantly sliced off, and then his sword intent surged into her and instantly obliterated her soul!

After he killed Qian Hu, Yang Ye gazed at Gu Xiu. The latter’s expression changed, and then he vanished into the sky.

“Fleeing?” Yang Ye laughed coldly, and then he stomped his right foot down and transformed into a blood red ray of light that vanished into the sky.

It didn’t take long for everyone in Phecda City to be alarmed.

Yang Ye was pursuing one of the seven marshals, Gu Xiu!

Once they found out about this, many in the city had strange expressions on their faces. Especially the Discipline Hall’s Master.

The Discipline Hall’s Master, Yang Lu, fell silent for a long time when he heard about it, and then he said, “What is that fellow up to now…?”
