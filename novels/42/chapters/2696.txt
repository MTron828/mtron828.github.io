Chapter 2697 – True Objective!

Tu has pushed him into a trap!

And the End World was intentionally getting him into more trouble!

Obviously, countless experts knew of him now, and he may even become the enemy of countless cultivators!

Those fellows were hostile to Destiny, and he’d been the same in the past. Besides that, if Qi Bitian wasn’t on his side, perhaps even she would target him!

Of course, Qi Bitian would never do it now!

He had a huge headache!

Yang Ye shook his head and left.

He couldn’t do anything about it now, and all he could do was fight against whatever came at him!

Yang Ye used Great Unknown to teleport to Eternal Border.

At this moment, the war between Eternal Kingdom and the desolate race was almost at its end.

Eternal Kingdom’s barrier had been destroyed.

Now, Eternal Kingdom and Eternal Border could be said to have been linked.

Huang Yu looked indifferently into the distance from the Eternal River.

The Eternal Lord and the ancestors of the various clans were before him.

There were quite a few experts behind Huang Ying. Especially Destiny Realm experts. Besides Huang Xuan and Huang Buer, there was the Void Lord, the undying race’s patriarch, and a few other mysterious experts.

The Eternal Lord gazed at Huang Ying for a long time before he said, “Are mountains of corpses what you wanted?”

Huang Ying replied indifferently, “This is what war is like, is it not?”

The Eternal Lord gazed at Huang Ying for a long time before he nodded, “Then let’s take each other down!”

He raised his right hand slightly and dropped it.

Liu Yuan and the ancestors of the other clans immediately charged at the desolate race.

Huang Ying’s eyes narrowed slightly, “Kill!”

Huang Buer, Huang Xuan, and the others behind him vanished on the spot.

Generals against generals and soldiers against soldiers.

The Eternal Lord, Huang Buer, and all the others entered space high above while the Desolate Deathguard fought the War Guard of Eternal Kingdom.

Yang Ye watched coldly from afar.

Regardless of whether it was the desolate race or Eternal Kingdom, he didn’t really care about them and wouldn’t interfere in their battle.

Of course, he would attack the Eternal Kingdom if it was necessary.

He had naturally not forgotten how they’d ganged up on him.

But at this moment, there was no need for him to interfere.

He wasn’t here to stop them from fighting, nor was he here to watch the show. He was here to stop them from destroying Eternal Border!

He didn’t think of himself as Destiny, but since the woman in white attached such importance to this place, and she was gone now, he felt that he had to do something for her.

“Sprite Formation!” Suddenly, a furious shout resounded.

Yang Ye looked over, and a fiery red woman suddenly shot up into the air, and there were countless sprites behind her.

Sprite Palace!

Yang Ye frowned slightly. At the same time, Snowy emerged from the Primordial Pagoda.

Snowy glanced at the sprites and was quite hesitant.

Meanwhile, Huang Ying glanced at the woman in red and spoke softly, “I’ve been waiting for you!”Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

As soon as he said that, a few figures suddenly appeared above the woman.

All of them were Destiny Realm experts!

The woman’s expression changed drastically.

Where the heck did the desolate race get so many Destiny Realm experts?

The Sprite Palace’s formation hadn’t even been formed when numerous terrifying auras slammed down upon the sprites!

At this moment, Eternal Kingdom’s side didn’t have any extra Destiny Realm experts to protect the sprites.

The sprites’ combat strength was absolutely pitiable, and they couldn’t fight back at all against these Destiny Realm experts.

It didn’t take long for a few dozen sprites to vanish from this world.

Snowy gazed at Yang Ye.

Yang Ye rubbed her head, and then he swung his sword!

Hiss!

A ray of sword energy shot through the sky.

The mysterious Destiny Realm experts suddenly stopped attacking and moved around 1km back.

A single ray of sword energy stopped before them!

At this moment, countless gazed toward the source of the sword energy, and it was where Yang Ye was standing!

Huang Ying’s eyes narrowed slightly when he saw Yang Ye.

Yang Ye brought Snowy over to the Eternal River, and then he glanced at both sides, “Stop for a while?”

An expert stepped forward from among the group of mysterious Destiny Realm experts, “Stop for a while? Who do you think you…”

Huang Ying suddenly said, “Step down.”

That Destiny Realm expert glanced at Huang Ying, “You have no right to give me orders!”

Suddenly, a ray of sword energy flashed.

The expression of that Destiny Realm expert changed drastically. He swiftly turned around and slapped his palm forward. As soon as he did that, his expression changed drastically again, and a sword moved along his arm like a venomous snake before finally stopping before his throat!

Yang Ye was still on the spot, but his sword was at the Destiny Realm expert’s throat.

That expert was stunned.

Yang Ye glanced at him, “Can you stop for a while now?”

That mysterious expert had an extremely unsightly expression on his face.

Yang Ye ignored that expert and gazed at Eternal Kingdom. At this moment, they were all looking at him. Especially the members of the War Dimension. After all, he was once a part of the War Dimension!

Liu Yuan stopped as well. Huang Xuan was still her opponent, and he glanced at Yang Ye but remained silent.

Yang Ye was truly terrifying right now!

Yang Ye ignored them all and gazed at Snowy. The latter went over to the fiery red woman. She glanced at the woman, and then she gazed at the sprites behind the woman.

Snowy waved her paw. She was telling them to leave with her.

The sprites exchanged glances, and then they gazed at the woman.

Yang Ye glanced coldly at the woman, “I’ll cut off your head if you dare to refuse!”

As soon as he said that, the woman’s face instantly turned unsightly.

Meanwhile, Snowy suddenly appeared before those sprites. She withdrew the Sprite Staff and pointed it at them. She was quite angry. After all, she was here to help them, but they were asking the woman for permission instead!

Snowy was very angry!

Suddenly, the woman said, “Go with her!”

Once they received her approval, all the sprites surged over to Snowy.

Actually, they wanted to go to Snowy, but they revered the woman. After all, she’d been taking care of them for many years.

It didn’t take long for all the sprites of the Sprite Palace to enter the Primordial Pagoda, but the woman in the red dress turned around and walked away.

Meanwhile, Snowy appeared before her. She gazed at Snowy for a long time, and then she shook her head and smiled, “I wanted to take you over there not because I planned to scheme against you, I just didn’t want you to stay with a human. But now it seems like staying with him is the best for you. Because he can protect you, and he clearly doesn’t have any ill intent toward you.”

She rubbed Snowy’s head, “Take care!”

She immediately transformed into a ray of red light that vanished into the distant sky.

Snowy gazed at Yang Ye and pointed at the woman.

Yang Ye nodded slightly, and then he gazed at the Eternal Kingdom and desolate race’s forces, “No matter what happens in your war or who wins, I hope the sprites remain safe.”

Snowy’s responsibility!

Actually, Snowy was the Good Sprite of the world, and she really cared about the sprites of this world. Even if she didn’t know much right now, based on how she’d asked him to help, he knew that Snowy had some responsibilities!

She was the kindest in the world, and the strongest among the sprites. So, protecting the sprites was her responsibility, and based on her past actions, she’d always been doing so!

So, since it was Snowy’s responsibility, and Snowy wanted to do it, then it was his responsibility too.

Snowy’s responsibility was his!

The desolate race and Eternal Kingdom’s forces glanced at Yang Ye and didn’t say a word.

Yang Ye didn’t say anything either and just left with Snowy.

He was certain that so long as he remained alive, both of their sides would not dare to slaughter any sprites!

It was entirely unnecessary. Killing them would offend him, and they weren’t stupid enough to do that!

Once Yang Ye left, the battle continued.

Yang Ye entered Eternal Kingdom and went to the Ancient Sword Sect. It was empty now.

Yang Ye went to the vast mountain peak.

Yang Ye suddenly said, “Show yourself!”

As soon as he said that, two people appeared nearby.

Heng Wangu and Zuo Mu!

Heng Wangu sized up Yang Ye and nodded, “An extraordinary genius indeed.”

Yang Ye spoke softly, “You’re already going to attack me?”

Heng Wangu shook his head, “We’re just here to ask if you’re willing to give up the Sprite Progenitor?”

Yang Ye shook his head.

Heng Wangu smiled, “If you give it up, you can go anywhere in this world. Trust me, give it up and go into seclusion. No one can touch you in ten years from now.”

Yang Ye glanced at Heng Wangu, “You definitely don’t want the Sprite Progenitor so that you can hide from Destiny! So what are you planning?”

Heng Wangu grinned, “You’re smart indeed. We do not seek to hide from destiny. As for the real reason, I can’t tell you yet. All I can tell you is that we’re determined to obtain the Sprite Progenitor. And that girl, Erya, we need her too.”

He shook his head at this point, “To be honest, I’m really surprised that both the good and evil are with you. If it wasn’t for them, I wouldn’t even want to act against you. You’re really not bad among the younger generation. Especially the way you do things. You make a clear distinction between kindness and enmity, and that’s something I appreciate.”

Yang Ye shook his head, “Unless I die, you will never get the Sprite Progenitor and Erya! Now, you can do your worst!”

Heng Wangu chuckled, “I knew your answer even before I came here.”

He gazed at the area behind Yang Ye, “May I know your name?”

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly.

There’s someone behind me?

A moment of silence ensued, and then an ethereal figure appeared nearby.

The ethereal figure suddenly said, “You want the Good Sprite and Evil Beast… Let me guess, your true objective isn’t Yang Ye, it’s Destiny!”
