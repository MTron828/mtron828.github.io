Chapter 114 – The Truth

After a short moment of silence, Yang Ye suddenly shook his head and smiled. “I admit that what you said is really makes sense, but I still have to refuse.”

“Why?” The woman frowned.

“Because I don’t trust you!” Yang Ye stared her in the eyes and said, “Since we met each other until now, you’ve only spoken half-truths. Just like this very moment, what you said is correct, and reality is indeed so. However, I feel that your true objective is definitely not so simple. So, if I really listen to you and cooperate with you, then I’ll probably be digging my own grave on your behalf!”

Yang Ye didn’t think that he was an idiot, but he wouldn’t think his intelligence was extraordinary as well. He was truly unable to see through this woman that constantly professed her fondness of him. No matter if it was her strength or thoughts, he was unable to see through them. Being unable to see through something represented danger, and since there was danger, then the best method was to not come into contact with such danger.

As for the matter with the Grand Qin Empire and the Darkbeast Empire, they didn’t know who he was at any rate. So, would anyone still remember him after this matter passed and he’d returned to Talisman Peak?

The woman gazed at Yang Ye for a short while before she smiled and said, “Little Brother, Big Sister still feels that it’s best for us to cooperate, but it’s best that you don’t’ think about surviving alone and leaving me in the lurch. Big Sister knows that your identity is definitely not simple, but Big Sister wants to tell you that it’s useless even if you’re the son of the Sword Sect’s Master. Because this matter is related to the dignity of the Darkbeast Empire and the Grand Qin Empire. Even though Big Sister was only heading to the Darkbeast Empire this time to become engaged and very few people know about it, it isn’t a very small number in the end. Since Big Sister eloped with someone, Big Sister will definitely face dire consequences, but I presume the two empires won’t allow that person who eloped with Big Sister to live peacefully. What do you think?” DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Yang Ye gazed at the woman and said seriously, “Actually, I really, really want to kill you. Trust me!”

If it wasn’t because of this woman, he would have probably subdued another beast king by now. If it wasn’t for this woman, perhaps he would have already....

In short, since he’d encountered this woman until now, not only had he not benefitted at all, he’d been swept into a whirlpool between the Grand Qin Empire and the Darkbeast Empire. So, this really made him feel like killing her.

The Woman smiled and said, “Big Sister admits that it was Big Sister’s fault, but we’re really on the same boat now. If you don’t cooperate with Big Sister, then we really might become a couple that dies together. You must understand that the Grand Qin Empire’s warrant is extremely terrifying!”

“I’ve already told you before! I don’t trust you!” said Yang Ye.

“Trust is formed gradually. We can form it gradually. Big Sister has the patience!” said the woman with a smile.

Yang Ye smiled and said, “I’m not interested in forming anything with you. Alright, I don’t want to waste my breath with you. As for the Darkbeast Empire and your Grand Qin Empire, they don’t know who I am at any rate. So, they can do as they please. I hope we never meet again!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye turned around and left.

He had to admit that the Grand Qin Empire and Darkbeast Empire were extremely formidable, but he would absolutely not believe the woman who stood before him. Because working together with the woman would be no different than working together with a tiger.

As for the two colossi, so long as he left the Grand Myriad Mountains and hide amongst the crowd, he refused to believe that they would be able to find him on Talisman Peak!

When she saw Yang Ye turn around and leave, the woman’s eyes spun before she hurriedly followed up to him, and she said while she walked, “Little Brother, Big Sister will really not harm you. If you cooperate with Big Sister, then there’ll only be benefits and no....”

She was speaking when her pupils suddenly constricted, and she dodged to the side. At this moment, a sword had stopped right at the place where she was standing moments ago, and it was Yang Ye who held the hilt of the sword.

Yang Ye sheathed his sword and said coldly, “I told you, don’t follow me! Alright?”

Does this woman really take me, Yang Ye, to be an idiot? She’s actually still thinking about using me?

“Little Brother, how heartless of you! You actually attacked Big Sister!” The woman patted her chest with a jade white hand, and then said resentfully, “To think that Big Sister had fallen deeply in love with you and intended to work together with you, yet you....”

“Shut up!” Yang Ye suddenly shouted. “I really don’t have the time to waste my breath with you. You’re already safe now. So, go do what you want to do by yourself and don’t follow me, alright?”

The woman’s expressions returned to normal when she heard this, and she said seriously, “Ye Yang, how about we speak seriously?”

“You really change your attitude quickly!” Yang Ye ridiculed.

The woman shook her head and said, “I know you have an opinion of me, but I think that we can still work together. I admit that I conceal some things from you, and I’ll tell it to you now. How about you decide whether to work together with me after you know the truth about everything?”

Yang Ye frowned when he saw the woman’s current expression, and he said after some time, “What truth? Let me be clear, if I feel that you’re deceiving me again, then I’ll leave immediately, and you can forget about mentioning anything related to working together!”

The woman combed the beautiful hair above her forehead, and then said with a serious expression, “Actually, my engagement with the Second Prince of the Darkbeast Empire wasn’t the decision of my Imperial Brother or Grandfather. My Grandfather is the Founding Emperor of the Grand Qin Empire while my older brother is the Emperor of the Grand Qin Empire. Both of them are in closed door cultivation to charge into the next realms of their cultivation, and it’s my nephew who’s ruling the empire.”

“Get to the point!” Yang Ye frowned and said, “I’m not interested in your imperial household!”

The woman smiled and said, “My engagement with the Darkbeast Empire’s second prince was my nephew’s idea, and he did this because he hoped to obtain the Second Prince’s help. This isn’t the main point. The main point is that no one can find out about this. Because my older brother and grandfather’s greatest taboo is colluding with the enemy. If others were to find out about this matter, then that nephew of mine can dream of sitting on the throne!”

“There are many holes in your story.” Yang Ye said in a low voice, “Firstly, you said that no one can know about this, then what about those cavalries that went over with you? Could it be that they aren’t people?”

“Do you think they’ll be able to leave the Grand Myriad Mountains alive?” The woman sneered. “The moment of my arrival in the Darkbeast Empire is the moment of their death!”

Yang Ye remained silent for a moment before he said, “Why did you agree to the engagement with the Second Prince?”

A wisp of cold and ghastly killing intent flashed through the woman’s eyes upon hearing this, and she said, “Because that nephew of mine threatened me with my mother! I know what you’re going to ask, I have the same father but different mother from the current Emperor. Coupled with the fact that my mother doesn’t have the backing of a good clan, so my nephew made me become a pawn of his!”

The imperial household really is the most heartless! Yang Ye shook his head. He’d heard others speak of this in the past, yet he hadn’t believed it completely, but he did now. The imperial household really stopped at nothing to achieve its objectives!

“Since he threatened you with your mother, then why did you still flee?” Yang Ye asked another question.

“Because I would only be able to rescue my mother and myself by doing that!” The woman said in a low voice, “If I really married that Second Prince, then with my nephew’s ruthless ways, he’ll definitely find a way to kill my mother. Conversely, if I flee, then he’ll be hesitant and fearful instead, and he’ll keep my mother alive to use her to threaten me.”

“Kill your mother?” Yang Ye said with disbelief, “What a joke! Your mother is an imperial concubine of the Founding Emperor at any rate. Would he even dare?”

A wisp of a sneer arose on the corners of the woman’s mouth, and she said, “Do you know how many imperial concubines my grandfather has?”

Before Yang Ye could answer her, she said, “It’s said that the concubines of an emperor number up to 3,000, but my grandfather doesn’t just have 3,000! He has over 8,000 imperial concubines in name, and there are countless more that didn’t receive official recognition. Do you know how many princes and princesses are there within the Grand Qin Empire? Even if we don’t mention my older brother who’s the Emperor, merely my grandfather has over 400 sons and around 1,000 daughters.”

Yang Ye couldn’t help but laugh. This Founding Emperor is an utter ‘stud’!

Now, he finally understood slightly. Since the Founding Emperor had so many imperial concubines, many were presumably relationships that only lasted a night, and this woman’s mother was probably just like that. The Grand Qin Empire’s imperial palace would definitely attach zero importance to these imperial concubines that didn’t come from good origins and didn’t receive the favor of the Founding Emperor.

After a short while, Yang Ye shook his head and said, “Is any of this related to me? Why must I work together with you?”

The woman looked at Yang Ye as if she was looking at an idiot, and she said, “You really are an idiot. The engagement between me and the Second Prince of the Darkbeast Empire is a secret, and for the sake of protecting this secret, that nephew of mine will kill both his personal guard and the Spirit Realm experts that he’d fostered. So, now that you’ve fled with me, do you think he’d let you and me go?”

Yang Ye laughed bitterly when he heard this and said, “I feel like I’ve fallen into your trap again!”

“Actually, even if I didn’t tell you this secret, but for safety’s sake, he would definitely not let you go,” said the woman.

Yang Ye thought for a moment and said, “I guarantee that I won’t tell anyone. Alright?”

“What do you think?” The woman smiled.

“Looks like it’s a no!” Yang Ye shrugged, and then he said, “Would that nephew of yours really misuse his power and issue a warrant of the Grand Qin Empire to put a bounty on me?”

“He won’t!” The woman shook her head and said, “He won’t issue a warrant, he’ll directly issue a death warrant. I presume that he has already done that, and he has started to investigate you. Don’t underestimate the ability of the Grand Qin Empire. It’s extremely easy for the Grand Qin Empire to investigate someone.”

“Perhaps he’ll give up on killing me after he finds out about my identity!” said Yang Ye.

“Oh?” The woman glanced at Yang Ye with surprise, and then she said with a smile, “Little Brother, you said that you aren’t a disciple of the Sword Sect, but your skill is even sharper than the disciples of the Sword Sect. Could it be that you’re an illegitimate son of the Sword Sect’s Master? But, even if you’re the illegitimate son of the Sword Sect’s Master, he still wouldn’t let you go. Of course, he wouldn’t deal with you in the open, but what about assassinations? If he doesn’t tell anyone, then would anyone know that he was behind it?”

“In other words, it seems like I can do nothing but wait for death to arrive?” asked Yang Ye.
