Chapter 2793 – Life and Death In One Clash!

Obviously, the mysterious expert didn’t want the Sprite Progenitor, he wanted to destroy the Sprite Progenitor so that Destiny wouldn’t get her!

Suddenly, the mysterious expert’s expression changed drastically because a sword had suddenly shot toward his hand!

It was an ordinary attack, but the mysterious expert practically instinctively pulled his hand back.

A hand caught Snowy’s falling figure!

Yang Ye’s hand!

Snowy looked up at Yang Ye. She was stunned for a moment, and then she started crying.

Yang Ye rubbed his chin against her little head, “Go inside for now! I’ll help you get revenge!”

Snowy nodded repeatedly and entered the Primordial Pagoda.

Meanwhile, An Nanjing appeared by Yang Ye’s side. She gazed at him and asked, “Were you disturbed?”

Yang Ye chuckled. “I’m fine. Comprehension depends on hard work and luck!”

An Nanjing nodded slightly and didn’t say anything else.

Yang Ye looked up at the mysterious expert, and the latter had retreated to the city gates. Obviously, he was still quite fearful of Yang Ye.

Bang!

Meanwhile, an explosion resounded in the sky above the city.

Yang Ye looked up, and a figure was being pushed back repeatedly. It was Yang Busi, of course! Once Monarch Yan revealed his true strength, perhaps the woman above the clouds was the only one in the world capable of fully suppressing him.

After all, the Lord of the Four Dimensional Universe had once fought that woman who remained high above the clouds!

An aura suddenly enveloped Yang Ye.

Yang Ye moved his gaze away and looked at the mysterious expert. Obviously, the latter planned to keep Yang Ye busy.

Yang Ye suddenly took a step forward!

The Life and Death Technique!

Life and death is just a thought away, and the sword decides their fate!

A ray of sword energy flashed in an instant. It was soundless. There was no sword howl, nor could any sword intent and slaughter intent be sensed from it. However, it couldn’t be compared to the attack Yang Ye launched previously. He couldn’t truly bring forth its might without truly sensing the arrival of death!

The mysterious expert acted as if he was facing a formidable opponent. He took a step forward and pressed a palm down. In an instant, countless fine specks of black light converged in his palm.

It was like he was holding a universe in the palm of his hand.

The mysterious expert raised his palm to stop Yang Ye’s sword energy.

Hiss!

A fine sound of something being sliced open resounded, but there was no huge explosion. The mysterious expert’s hand trembled while the sword energy trembled as well. Meanwhile, there were no fluctuations of energy around the point of collision!

Because both of them had controlled their energy to their limits!

Suddenly, a sword stabbed forward from behind the sword energy, and the mysterious expert retreated. He retreated all the way until he was 300m outside the city, but Yang Ye’s sword was still following him closely.

In the end, the mysterious expert couldn’t retreat anymore because Yang Ye’s sword was growing faster and faster.

The mysterious expert stopped and spoke softly, “Stellar Annihilation!”

Countless black specks of light suddenly vanished from his palm, and they were replaced by tiny blue specks of light. They were like miniature stars in the palm of his hand.

As soon as these stars appeared, they started to burn!

Swish!

Yang Ye’s sword energy instantly vanished. Meanwhile, his sword stabbed against the burning stars.

Bang!

A ray of sword energy and stellar energy swept out into the surroundings.

Yang Ye and the mysterious expert took around 100 steps back!

The mysterious expert glanced at his palm, and there was an injury there from Yang Ye’s sword.

Meanwhile, the Sword Precursor was burning from the tiny stars in the mysterious expert’s palm.

Yang Ye shook his sword lightly, and a strand of blood surged into the Sword Precursor. In an instant, the sword returned to normal.

As the sword was made of blood, the man was the sword, and the sword was the man. The Sword Precursor was truly one with him. Right now, his relationship with the Sword Precursor was one where the Sword Precursor would die with him, but it would remain eternal while he remained alive!

The mysterious expert didn’t attack again and just shook his head lightly, “Yang Ye, you didn’t disappoint me in the end!”

Yang Ye frowned slightly, “What do you mean?”

The mysterious expert replied softly, “You’re a sword cultivator, one who is very loyal, but also one who is merciless. Your Sword Dao can be emotionless, or I should say, it can be emotionless because of emotion. It’s very rarely seen.”

Yang Ye shook his head, “Let’s just fight!”

Yang Ye took a step forward, and the mysterious expert was already in front of him.

The Sword Precursor shot forward!

At this moment, Yang Ye’s attacks weren’t as vicious as they used to be, but they were calmer and more composed.T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

The mysterious expert suddenly took a small step back when facing this attack, and the sword arrived just an inch away from his forehead. However, the sword couldn’t go further because the mysterious expert’s hands had clamped down on it. After that, he moved his head to the side and moved forward while still holding onto the sword. His figure immediately arrived before Yang Ye, and then he released his hands. Suddenly, two burning stars appeared in his grasp.

The mysterious expert slammed them at Yang Ye!

However, a sword suddenly appeared in Yang Ye’s left grasp, and he raised it to defend himself!

Burial!

Burial forcibly stopped the mysterious expert’s attack at the critical moment. But at practically the instant they collided, Burial started to burn. Meanwhile, a mysterious wave of energy appeared around Yang Ye and the mysterious expert.

The Sword Domain!

The flames on Burial were instantly suppressed.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye’s swords slashed simultaneously.

Hiss! Hiss!

Two rays of sword energy crisscrossed, and the mysterious expert shot backward by over 3km. Moreover, while he was retreating the two rays of sword energy chased after him like shooting stars.

The mysterious expert clenched his right fist and slammed it forward.

A black vortex suddenly formed before the fist.

It was like a miniature universe that contained everything and devoured everything!

Yang Ye’s sword energy shook violently upon coming into contact with it, and then the sword energy gradually turned ethereal.

Yang Ye pressed his right palm against the hilt of his sword and took a step forward. At practically the exact same moment, the mysterious expert took a step forward, and then a ray of sword energy and a black vortex appeared before them and collided!

Hiss!

The black vortex was instantly slashed into two. However, the vortex did not vanish, and it started devouring the sword energy instead!

An instant later, the black vortex appeared above Yang Ye, and then it suddenly expanded like a huge mouth and swallowed Yang Ye.

Yang Ye vanished, and only the black vortex remained!

However, the mysterious expert suddenly frowned slightly and moved over 1km back. At the same time, the black vortex shook violently, and then rays of sword energy stretched out from it.

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!

The entire black vortex was instantly sliced into countless bits!

But right at this moment, a pitch black door suddenly appeared before Yang Ye!

Yang Ye frowned slightly upon seeing it, but he didn’t swing his sword and moved 300m back instead. Right when he was about to scan the door carefully, the black door suddenly vanished, and it was replaced by the mysterious expert!

Yang Ye’s gaze fell on the mysterious expert. He knew the expert before him was still hiding something! That door had felt extremely dangerous to him!

But it made sense because both the mysterious expert and Monarch Yan would never dare to think about going against that woman without some strength!

The mysterious expert didn’t attack again, but Yang Ye had to. Because Yang Busi was no match for Monarch Yan. If he were to get locked in combat here, Yang Busi would be in danger. Especially when Tian Xiu and Qi Bitian weren’t here!

Yang Ye looked up at the mysterious expert, “Shall we decide on life and death in one clash?”

As soon as he said that, Yang Ye didn’t wait for the mysterious expert’s answer and just vanished on the spot.

Decide life and death in one clash!

Yang Ye was serious about it, and he was risking his life. Because he wanted to decide on the outcome as soon as possible. No, he wanted to decide their fate!

However, at the instant he vanished, the mysterious expert rapidly shot backward. He wasn’t just moving fast, he was traveling through space. So, it made him look like he was just slowly strolling backward!

However, Yang Ye’s sword couldn’t strike him no matter what!

Just like that, after a few dozen breaths of time, Yang Ye stopped because the mysterious expert still remained in front of him!

The mysterious expert didn’t choose to clash with Yang Ye!

If he clashed with Yang Ye, he would be accepting the will to decide their fate in this clash, and he clearly didn’t want to do that!

Yang Ye glanced at the mysterious expert, “You won’t fight or retreat! Why are you being so hesitant like a little girl?”

The mysterious expert crossed his arms before him and remained silent.

Yang Ye ignored him and shot off into the sky. Yang Ye was quite surprised to discover that the mysterious expert didn’t try to stop him!

Yang Ye couldn’t be bothered to care what the mysterious expert was planning because Yang Busi was already being suppressed, and her life was in danger!

Along with Yang Ye’s charge into the sky, Monarch Yan slammed Yang Busi away and suddenly stopped attacking before retreating rapidly. He retreated over 3km away and left the sky above the sky.

Yang Ye didn’t give chase. He went over to Yang Busi. At this moment, there was a fist-size hole in Yang Busi’s stomach, and there were numerous other holes and injuries all over her body!

Her body was on the verge of collapse!

If her strength wasn’t formidable, she would be dead by now.

Yang Ye spoke softly, “I’m sorry!”

Yang Busi shook her head, “People of the Yang Clan never say things like that to their own.”

Yang Ye smiled, “Alright.”

She gazed at Yang Ye, “I want to recuperate there. It’s not a problem, right?”

Yang Ye smiled, “Of course!”

Yang Busi nodded and entered the Primordial Pagoda.

On the Ascension Platform, Yang Busi gazed at Snowy, who was staring at her, and said, “Little fellow, what are you looking at? Hurry up and help me!”

Snowy was stunned speechless.

Outside the Primordial Pagoda.

Yang Ye looked up at Monarch Yan, “Monarch Yan, do you dare to take a swing of my sword? I call it the Life and Death Technique, so let’s decide on life and death in one clash!”

As soon as he said that, the entire world suddenly fell silent!
