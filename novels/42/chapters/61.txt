Chapter 62 – Giving The Sword Chest Away

Elder Qian pointed at one of the light blue little circles and said, “This teleportation formation leads to Rising Sun City. Once you arrive there, you can choose to ride the flying beasts of merchant groups and head to Southpeace City. Of course, you can also utilize the Intercity Teleportation Formation of the Grand Qin Empire, but it’s extremely expensive!”

Elder Qian withdrew two talismans and passed it to Yang Ye as he said, “This is a low-grade Strider Talisman and a mid-grade Healing Talisman. The Strider Talisman can improve your speed by 30% for four hours, whereas, the Healing Talisman is able to quickly heal any injuries you suffer so long as it’s not one that has injured your foundation!”

As he gazed at the two talismans that Elder Qian passed to him, Yang Ye’s heart felt warm. He knew that even though Elder Qian was an Outer Court Elder, such talismans were extremely precious to Elder Qian. After all, it was utterly impossible to exchange for such talismans without over 10,000 Contribution Points! As an Outer Court Elder, Elder Qian only obtained a few hundred Contribution points every single month!

These two talismans weren’t precious to Yang Ye, but Elder Qian’s intentions really touched Yang Ye! Even though Elder Qian said that he wouldn’t help Yang Ye, weren’t these actions an indirect form of assistance?

Yang Ye took a deep breath, and he didn’t refuse it. He received the two talismans from Elder Qian and said seriously, “Thank you, Elder Qian!”

Elder Qian smiled as he shook his head and said, “It’s only two talismans. There’s no need to thank me at all! I can only help you this much. Go on!”

Yang Ye bowed to Elder Qian, and then he walked towards the blue circle. Right when Yang ye was about to walk into the blue circle, a clear and melodious voice caused Yang Ye to stop moving!

“Little Laborer! Wait right there! Wait!” It was Bao’er’s voice.

Yang Ye turned around and looked down from the platform when he heard this voice. He saw Bao’er running swiftly towards him, and she was even waving as she ran.

The corners of Elder Qian’s mouth twitched when he saw Bao’er, and then he said, “She waited outside for two days when you were in the Sword Servant Pagoda. In the end, she returned to the Talisman Peak when you still didn’t emerge from the pagoda. Right, both of you have a good chat. I won’t join in!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Elder Qian didn’t even wait for Yang Ye to answer him before he leaped towards the side, and as soon as he descended to the ground, he vanished from Yang Ye’s field of vision with a few movements.

As he watched Elder Qian run as if he was fleeing for his life, Yang Ye shook his head and smiled. Looks like the Outer Court Elders are extremely fearful and troubled by Bao’er! 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Bao’er ran over to Yang Ye and gasped heavily for breath. Her little face seemed to have flushed red from worry, and it was like an apple and was extremely cute.

“Calm down and rest first. I won’t leave for now!” Yang Ye smiled as he spoke.

Bao’er glared at Yang Ye, and she said after resting for a moment, “Little Laborer, Bao’er hates you to death! You didn’t even come to look for me after you came out from there. Tell me, do you even take me to be a friend?”

“Bao’er, I just came out from there not too long ago! Moreover, I don’t know where the Talisman Peak is, so how could I go looking for you!?” Yang Ye spoke in an aggrieved manner.

“I don’t care!” Bao’er grunted and said, “In any case, you made me wait for two days, and I want you to compensate me!”

“That’s your true objective, right!?” said Yang Ye.

Bao’er’s face that had just returned to normal turned red once more. She seemed to have turned angry from embarrassment, and she raised her right leg and kicked Yang Ye forcefully before she said, “I don’t care, I don’t care! You’ve made me angry. Give me the little fellow and I’ll forgive you. I want the little fellow....”

Yang Ye’s head ached slightly. Bao’er is really captivated by the little fellow!

But even if Yang Ye was willing to give the little fellow to Bao’er, would the little fellow be willing to leave with Bao’er?

“Little Laborer, give me the little fellow, alright? I guarantee that the little fellow will have a life of luxury by my side. I won’t allow anyone to bully it, and I’ll take extremely good care of it, alright? It wouldn’t be happy if it follows you because you’re too poor!” said Bao’er.

Yang Ye’s face turned black. I admit that I’m poor, but what do you mean by it won’t be happy? Yang Ye really wanted to throw Bao’er into his Vortex Dantian to see how happy the little fellow was within the pool of Profound Energy!

Yang Ye thought for a moment before he said in a gentle voice, “Bao’er, didn’t I tell you already? If you want the little fellow, then you have to make the little fellow have a good impression of you and make the little fellow take you as a friend. So long as the little fellow takes you to be a friend, then would it refuse when you ask it to follow you?”

“But the little fellow is always by your side, and Bao’er doesn’t have any time to form a relationship with it at all! Why don’t you give the little fellow to me, and allow me to form a relationship with it, alright? Of course, I won’t treat you unfairly!” As she spoke, Bao’er withdrew a sword chest and passed it to Yang Ye as she said, “Look at this treasure, this is a great treasure. There are 36 high-grade Yellow Rank swords within it, and there’s even an inscription on the sword chest. It’s a mid-grade Profound Rank sword formation. It’s very, very, very, very, very, formidable!”

As he gazed at the sword chest, Yang Ye’s heart sped up uncontrollably. It was obviously a treasure at first sight, but he really couldn’t give the little fellow away!

Yang Ye took a deep breath and tried his best to avoid thinking about the sword chest, and he felt slightly amused as he gazed at Bao’er who seemed like a little fox. Since they’d met, this little she-devil had first tried to obtain the little fellow by force, then she’d tried to be diplomatic, and now she’d tried to tempt him. This little she-devil will truly stop at nothing for the sake of the little fellow!

Yang Ye thought for a moment, and then he said in a serious manner, “Bao’er, truthfully speaking, I’ve been tempted by this sword chest. However, I really can’t give the little fellow to you. It’s only following by my side because of some reasons that even I don’t understand fully. Moreover, just like you, the little fellow is my friend, and I don’t have the right to give it to you!”

Bao’er went silent. After a short while, she said, “But, but I really, really like the little fellow, I really, really like it!”

Even though she’s slightly unruly, she’s still a child in the end! Yang Ye sighed in his heart, and he rubbed Bao’er’s little head in a doting manner before he said in a gentle voice, “Bao’er, let me ask you. Do you want to become friends with the little fellow, or do you want to take the little fellow to be your pet?”

Bao’er blinked and said, “Is there any difference between that?”

“Of course!” Yang Ye said, “Do you know why the little fellow is willing to stay by my side?”

“Because it met you first!”

The corners of Yang Ye’s mouth twitched, and then he nodded and said, “Alright, that’s also a reason. However, do you know why it wasn’t tempted by you and still chose to stay by my side?”

Bao’er thought seriously for a moment and said, “Perhaps you gave it even better things!”

Yang Ye was speechless. Why doesn’t this little girl get into character? Can’t you just ask me why?

Yang Ye decided to stop asking, and he directly came to the point and said, “The reason the little fellow is willing to stay by my side is that we’re friends. It takes me to be a friend, and I take it to be a friend as well. While it stays by my side, it’s free, and it can leave at any time. But if it follows you, then you’ll take it to be a pet, and it would lose its freedom. If it was you, would you be willing to lose your freedom?”

Bao’er glanced doubtfully at Yang Ye and said, “Little Laborer, are you deceiving Bao’er? In the past, when Grandpa was unwilling to give Bao’er something, he would speak about many principles to me.”

Yang Ye. “....”

Right when Yang Ye was speechless, Bao’er said, “However, I think what you said makes sense. In the future, I won’t try to take the little fellow from you. I’ll try to make friends with the little fellow. Yes, make friends, and not make it be Bao’er’s pet!”

Yang Ye heaved a sigh of relief when he heard this. The little she-devil has finally come around.

Bao’er passed the sword chest to Yang Ye and said, “I’ll give this piece of trash to you. It just occupies space in my spatial ring. Alright, since there’s nothing else, I’ll be returning to the Talisman Peak.”

As she spoke, she turned around, yet after she took two steps, she seemed to have thought of something and turned around once more before she said, “Little Laborer, Grandpa will be back soon, so you can’t fall behind in the Dao of Talismans. Grandpa is extremely strict!”

“Of course not!” said Yang Ye with a smile.

Bao’er nodded, and then she placed her hands behind her back as she jogged off into the distance.

As he watched Bao’er’s pigtails swing about as she left, Yang Ye smiled, and his heart felt warm when he lowered his head and gazed at the sword chest in his hands.

Yang Ye shook his head and placed the sword chest into his spatial ring, and then he walked into the teleportation formation.
