Chapter 1798 – Want Revenge?

Ying Yu had decided to retreat because his intuition told him that they may not be able to retreat if they didn’t do it right now.

Even though the Undertaker hadn’t lost yet, based on the current situation, he couldn’t do anything to Yang Ye either.

Moreover, the Undertaker himself may be in danger.

Once the Undertaker lost or was killed, then they would have to face a 6th stage True Realm expert from the Wu Clan, Yang Ye, and An Nanjing. Moreover, once Yang Ye and An Nanjing joined forces, they would have no choice but to flee!

Ying Yu had the situation analyzed. So, he chose to retreat before the Undertaker truly lost.

However, he’d overlooked something, Yang Ye.

How could Yang Ye possibly allow them to leave?

Ying Yu and the others’ hearts sank when they heard Yang Ye. A moment of silence ensued, and then Ying Yu suddenly gazed at the Undertaker, “His strength has surpassed the 6th stage of the True Realm by relying on external sources of strength. You naturally have no need to fear him with the strength you possess, but if you continue fighting him by yourself, then it’ll definitely be a waste of time. So, why don’t we join forces?”

The Undertaker wiped off the blood on the corner of his mouth and gazed at Yang Ye. To be more precise, he was looking at Yang Ye’s right hand. He fell silent for an instant and nodded, “Alright!”

Ying Yu took a deep breath and waved his right hand, “Do everything you can to kill Yang Ye!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he charged at Yang Ye. The over 40 True Realm experts behind him hurriedly charged at Yang Ye as well. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

The Undertaker fell silent for a moment, and then he charged at Yang Ye.

Two 6th stage True Realm experts and over 40 experts at the 3rd stage of the True Realm or above. Just the aura from such a force was sufficient to crush Yang Ye.

“Attack!” Suddenly, Wu Ye’s voice resounded. At this moment, the Wu Clan was tied to Yang Ye, they would live and die together. If Yang Ye died, then the Wu Clan would be finished too.

So, they had to join the battle!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye tightened his grip on the wooden sword while ferocity filled his eyes. A moment later, he stomped his right foot down and transformed into a ray of blood red light that shot forward explosively.

This time, Yang Ye’s target wasn’t the Undertaker, it was the True Realm experts from the five clans. With his current strength, experts below the 5th stage would only take a single swing of his sword. As for experts at the 5th stage, they would just take two swings at most!

As soon as Yang Ye charged into the crowd, the slaughter began.

Heads flew with every flash of light!

It practically took just a breath of time for someone’s head to fly.

The experts of the five clans were horrified by this. Especially the cultivators below the 5th stage of the True Realm. At this moment, they were absolutely horrified. Many had the desire to retreat. Actually, it wasn’t just a desire, they’d started to retreat.

Even the Wang Clan and Li Clan’s patriarch were amongst them.

The Undertaker and Ying Yu wanted to stop Yang Ye, but Yang Ye refused to fight them. His objective was the ordinary True Realm experts. So, they became extremely powerless against him. Because they couldn’t keep up with his speed.

In just a short while, Ying Yu finally realized how serious the situation was. Because over a dozen True Realm experts had died at Yang Ye’s hands!

Ying Yu’s anxious voice resounded, “Retreat! Hurry!”

“Retreat? It’s too late for that!” Suddenly, a ghastly voice resounded, and then Yang Lianshuang appeared here. Nether Maiden and the others were with her.

Ying Yu and the others’ expressions became extremely unsightly when they saw Yang Lianshuang’s group.

Retreat!

At this moment, that was the only thought left in their minds.

Besides the Undertaker, Ying Yu and the others shot towards the distance. They still had some hope earlier, and they felt that they could gang up and kill Yang Ye or even crush the Wu Clan. However, Yang Lianshuang’s arrival allowed them to realize that it was impossible now. Even if they had two more 6th stage True Realm experts!

Yang Ye didn’t chase after them. He gazed at Yang Lianshuang, “I’ll leave them to you!”

She nodded slightly and gazed at Wu Ye, “Do you want revenge?”

Wu Ye replied, “Of course!”

“Then come!” As soon as she finished speaking, she vanished on the spot with Nether Maiden and the others.

Wu Ye gazed at Wu Wen, “Stay here to deal with the matters here. The rest of you come with me!” He immediately led the Wu Clan’s experts after Ying Yu’s group.

They would naturally not give up a chance to strike their enemies when their enemies were down.

Yang Ye gazed at the Undertaker, “It’s time for us to end this.”

His figure transformed into a ray of light that vanished on the spot and appeared behind the Undertaker. At the same time, his wooden sword slashed towards the Undertaker’s nape.

The Undertaker’s reaction was extremely swift, and he immediately turned around and slammed his fist forward.

Boom!

A muffled explosion resounded, and the Undertaker was blasted over 3km away. At the same time, his entire right arm had been cracked open.

The Undertaker glanced at his cracked open arm, fell silent for an instant, and then looked up at Yang Ye, “What arm is that? It’s actually so strong!”

Yang Ye didn’t answer him and just vanished on the spot again.

A vicious glow flashed through the Undertaker’s eyes, and then he soared up into the air while the image of a fierce beast appeared behind him. After that, he clenched his right hand and slammed it forward!

Boom!

An extremely powerful wave of energy sprayed out from his fist. As soon as it was released, the ray of light Yang Ye had transformed into was instantly dispersed, but Yang Ye swung his sword again.

Boom!

The powerful aura that the Undertaker emanated was instantly sliced into two. At the same time, Yang Ye appeared before him, and the powerful energy contained within the wooden sword caused the space around them to collapse. As soon as the surroundings transformed into a black hole, Yang Ye relied on the Dark Energy in the surroundings to make the might of the wooden sword become even more terrifying!

The Undertaker’s pupils constricted when he saw the wooden sword shoot towards him, and he pressed his palms together.

Roar!

The beast image behind him roared at Yang Ye, and a wave of powerful energy rippled out. It instantly caused the surrounding space to ripple along with it, and Yang Ye was forcefully slowed down to a stop by it.

Meanwhile, the Undertaker suddenly pressed down his palms at Yang Ye, “Obliterate!”

As soon as he finished speaking, the beast image behind him suddenly raised its claws and slammed them at Yang Ye.

Boom!

A wave of powerful force descended from above him. It caused countless buildings in the city below to be blasted into powder. Fortunately, the people in the city had been evacuated, so no one was injured.

A ferocious smile curled up on Yang Ye’s lips, and then he flipped his right palm. The wooden sword shook violently. Yang Ye stomped his right foot down and transformed into a ray of light that shot up into the sky. A moment later, he collided with the wave of force.

Boom!

The space which had just been repaired there collapsed once more.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye’s figure transformed into a ray of light and charged at the Undertaker.

The Undertaker took a deep breath and waved his hands. A wave of powerful energy swept out from within him. He gazed at Yang Ye’s charging figure and said, “I never imagined that a 1st stage True Realm cultivator could force me to use my trump card!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he stretched his arms towards the side. In an instant, the beast image trembled, and then it suddenly charged at Yang Ye.

Meanwhile, Qiong Qi’s voice resounded in Yang Ye’s mind, “Kid, be careful! That demon beast is from the large universe. Even though it’s just in soul form, it still can’t be underestimated!”

At the same time, Hou Qing’s voice resounded in Yang Ye’s mind as well, “Kid, let me out. It’ll only take me an instant to dispose of trash like that.”

Yang Ye ignored Hou Qing. He didn’t underestimate the beast before him. He fell silent for an instant, and then a small flame appeared before him. A moment later, it covered the wooden sword!

The Divine Yin Flame!

Once the flames enveloped the wooden sword, Yang Ye took a deep breath and took a step forward, and then he transformed into a flaming beam of light that shot forward.

It only took a moment for him to collide with the beast.

A moment of silence ensued once they came into contact.

Hiss!

The flaming beam of light pierced through the beast, and it only took an instant to arrive before the Undertaker. The latter’s pupils constricted slightly, but he didn’t just sit there and wait for his death to arrive. His profound energy surged madly, and a violet leather armor appeared on him.

A moment later, the flaming wooden sword stabbed against the armor. In just an instant, the armor caved in, but it wasn’t pierced. The Undertaker heaved a sigh of relief when he noticed this, and he was about to retreat.

However, Yang Ye suddenly grabbed the wooden sword with his left hand too, and then he twisted it.

Hiss!

The wooden sword pierced through the armor, and then the Undertaker’s figure stiffened on the spot. It was because the wooden sword had pierced through his chest, and the Divine Yin Flame had spread within his body.

The Undertaker stared blankly at Yang Ye and said, “I still want to get through Heaven Pillar Mountain….”

Yang Ye withdrew his sword and said, “Do it in your next life!”

The Undertaker’s body was instantly engulfed in flames, and then it was incinerated into nothingness.

Suddenly, a voice resounded, “Amazing! I didn’t expect the Undertaker to die at the hands of a 1st stage True Realm cultivator!”
