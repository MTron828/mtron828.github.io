Chapter 2258 – The Samadhi Flame

Countless people howled madly when they saw Yang Ye and An Nanjing.

The experts from the large universe were filled with despair when facing those ten extraordinary experts of the undying race!

Hope was right behind those experts, but they instill despair in all of them. Since they arrived, those ten experts had slaughtered around 10,000 in such a short amount of time!

Despair!

But at their moment of despair, Yang Ye arrived!

While Yang Ye wasn’t here for them, they didn’t think so much about it. All they knew was that Yang Ye was here, and so they had hope.

No one charged anymore, and all of them were looking at Yang Ye!

Master Tian stood before Yang Ye and An Nanjing, and the ten Undead Warriors were behind Master Tian.

All of them stood in a neat row, and their auras were deep as an ocean.

Yang Ye glanced at the door of light behind them. At this moment, many experts of the undying race had gone through it, but the door of light could only accommodate a few hundred at once, so it would take many rounds for all the experts of the undying race to be teleported.

Yang Ye withdrew his gaze and looked toward Elder Yuan and the others. Elder Yuan nodded slightly to display that they were ready.

Yang Ye looked back at Master Tian, and the latter sized up Yang Ye, “I presume you’re Yang Ye. At such an age…”

Master Tian hadn’t even finished speaking when Yang Ye vanished on the spot.

Hiss!

An instant later, a sword arrived above Master Tian!

However, it was stopped just half an inch away from Master Tian because a hand had grabbed it.

It belonged to Master Tian!

At this moment, there was a strange silver glow around Master Tian, and his hand was covered in that silver light as it held Yang Ye’s sword. Moreover, the silver light had coiled around Yang Ye’s sword, causing his sword to tremble violently.

After a short stalemate, a strand of flames suddenly surged along Yang Ye’s arm and arrived on his sword.

Bang!

Master Tian was blasted away. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

The Samadhi Flame.

Yang Ye was about to follow up with another attack when his expression suddenly changed. It was because a ray of cold light had shot toward him.

It was fast!

Extremely fast!

That was what Yang Ye felt.

Yang Ye instinctively waved his sword, and it slashed against the cold light. However, the powerful energy it carried caused a mincing pain to surge through Yang Ye’s right arm. But that wasn’t even the end of it, there were nine other rays of cold light behind the first one.

If one looked carefully, one would notice that they were all saber energy!

The saber energy shot toward Yang Ye’s weak points from various tricky angles, and they were extremely swift to the point Yang Ye couldn’t dodge them!

Rumble!

Muffled explosions resounded, and then Yang Ye was blasted far away. However, as soon as he stopped himself, a black shadow appeared before him, and then a saber slammed down at his head.

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly. He flipped his right hand and flicked his sword upward.

Right when he attacked, another figure suddenly appeared behind him. If one looked carefully, one would notice it was another one of those ten Undead Warriors. That figure had his back toward Yang Ye and launched a backhand strike at Yang Ye.

It shot straight at Yang Ye’s back!

Bang!

Yang Ye had stopped the saber above him, but the saber behind him had struck against his back. However, the Primordial Armor appeared at this moment, yet it still couldn’t stop the saber from stabbing through!

Hiss!

The saber stabbed into Yang Ye’s skin, and it could instantly obliterate his internal organs if it went just half an inch deeper. However, slaughter intent and sword intent swept out of Yang Ye at the instant it stabbed into him.

Bang!

The mysterious experts above and behind him instantly vanished!

Yang Ye moved around 3km back, and those two who attacked him had returned to where they were. It was like they had never attacked!

A wisp of blood seeped out slowly from the corner of Yang Ye’s mouth.

The experts from the large universe turned pale at the sight of this. Even An Nanjing’s face became quite gloomy.

Their strength was actually that formidable!

Yang Ye wiped off the blood on the corner of his mouth and gazed at them. Meanwhile, Master Tian spoke abruptly, “Needless to say, you’re quite strong. Unfortunately, do you know who they are? The Undead Warriors. They are the most elite warriors of my undying race, and every single one of them crawled out from piles of corpses. I heard you’ve killed many too, but the people you’ve killed are nothing in comparison to them.”

Yang Ye took a deep breath. He knew Tian Xiu had told him the truth. They were really extremely strong, but it did make sense to him. The undying race was a huge race that had existed for so many years, so it was normal for it to possess such experts!

Now, he had a problem in front of him.

He had to deal with them or Elder Yuan’s group couldn’t enter the teleportation formation!

Yang Ye glanced at the portal, and he noticed that a third of the undying race had passed through. It would take two hours at most for all of them to get through. At that time, they would have nothing else to worry about, and the undying race was really likely to turn off the formation and attack the large universe with their full strength.

He had to deal with these ten experts!

Yang Ye flipped his left hand, and the Sword Precursor appeared there while the Sword Supreme appeared in his right hand.

Dual swords!

Bang! Bang!

Two terrifying intents swept out from him, and Yang Ye’s aura instantly rose explosively!

Sword intent and slaughter intent!

Endless slaughter intent and sword intent filled the area!

Yang Ye glanced at An Nanjing, “Help me!”

As soon as he said that, he stomped his right foot down and charged at the ten Undead Warriors.

A sharp sword howl resounded through the world!

Meanwhile, An Nanjing closed her eyes slowly, and then Blazing Fury suddenly transformed into a ray of fiery light that shot at the Undead Warriors.

Bang! Bang!

The entire expanse of space here shook violently like an earthquake was rampaging through it!

At the instant Yang Ye attacked, one of the Undead Warriors took a step forward, and then he swung his saber at Yang Ye with both hands.

Hiss!

A brilliant ray of saber energy tore through space, and it turned the surrounding space ethereal as it traveled.

Yang Ye put his swords together and swung it too.

Bang!

As soon as they descended, the Undead Warrior’s saber energy was instantly sliced into two. At that same instant that the saber energy was sliced open, a black shadow flashed over to Yang Ye, and then a saber descended upon him!

Yang Ye didn’t choose to dodge this attack, he went head-on against it!

Faint flames appeared on his sword, and it instantly covered them. A moment later, Yang Ye put his swords together and swung them again.

Bang!

An explosion resounded, and then two figures were blasted away.

It was Yang Ye and the Undead Warrior!

But this time, Yang Ye stopped himself very quickly and attacked once more.

Hiss!

A ray of flaming sword energy tore through space and slammed against the Undead Warrior. But right at this moment, a saber suddenly shot over and slammed against Yang Ye’s sword energy.

Another Undead Warrior had attacked!

Bang!

Yang Ye’s sword energy exploded apart and was obliterated!

Yang Ye’s face fell at the sight of this, and he looked toward the side. An Nanjing was in battle with two Undead Warriors, and while she hadn’t gained the upper hand, she wasn’t at a disadvantage either.

They were in a stalemate!

As for the remaining six Undead Warriors and Master Tian, they remained around the experts of the undying race. Obviously, they weren’t attacking because they were afraid that someone would suddenly attack the others behind them!

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts, gazed at the Undead Warriors before him, and then tightened his grip on his swords. The Undead Warriors didn’t attack either. Obviously, they were waiting, waiting for the others to leave the large universe. But Yang Ye had to let Elder Yuan’s group go through the portal before the entire undying race was evacuated.

He was more anxious than the Undead Warriors before him!

He knew he couldn’t delay any longer!

Yang Ye glanced at his swords, and then he closed his eyes slowly, “Senior Samadhi Flame, I hope you’ll help me with your main body.”

The Sword Domain?

He naturally couldn’t use it. If he did, he could kill one of them, but the price would be something he couldn’t endure right now. There were ten Undead Warriors and Master Tian here!

A moment of silence ensued, and then the Samadhi Flame’s voice resounded in Yang Ye’s mind, “With my full strength?”

Yang Ye nodded, “Yes!”

A short moment of silence ensued, and then the Samadhi Flame replied, “Your body won’t be able to endure it!”

Yang Ye took a deep breath, “I have to, even if I can’t!”

The Samadhi Flame suddenly said, “Ask the Primordial Pagoda to protect your body and soul.”

Yang Ye nodded, and then an ethereal ray of golden light enveloped him.

Boom!

A moment later, a strand of flames surged out from within him and enveloped his entire body, causing Yang Ye to be instantly transformed into a flaming figure.

Once the Samadhi Flame appeared, the temperature here instantly turned scorching, and the space in the surroundings even started becoming ethereal.

Suddenly!

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!

The space around Yang Ye started burning!
