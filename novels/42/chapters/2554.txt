Chapter 2555

The abyss!

When he leaped down the abyss, Yang Ye knew very well what he was about to face!

If he didn’t jump down, he would have to fight the expert from the Soul Sect to the death. Based on his current state, he had no chance of winning!

But if he jumped down, it was dangerous too!

He'd naturally not forgotten the dangers he’d encountered down there, and he’d never forgotten the feeling he’d gotten at the time!

But everything down there was unknown!

His choice was to give it a try!

So, Yang Ye leaped down the abyss.

Not long after he leaped down, the expert from the Soul Sect appeared by the abyss, and he was slightly hesitant as he looked down.

It was a forbidden place!

A forbidden place throughout Eternal Kingdom!

The stronger a person was, the easier it was for them to die down there!

If an expert at his level went down there, the consequence would definitely not be pleasant!

So, to go or not to go?

The black robed man was in quite a dilemma!

It didn’t take long for him to decide that he should give it a try.

Because all divine senses were isolated from the abyss, he couldn’t scan it at all. So, if Yang Ye fled from down below, all their efforts would have gone to waste.

He didn’t hesitate to jump in.

However, it only took a moment for an explosion to resound, and then a figure was blasted out of the abyss.

It was the expert from the Soul Sect!

His figure slammed against the ground, and his body instantly exploded apart. As for his soul, it turned utterly ethereal!

He’d almost been killed!

He gazed at the abyss with horror, and even his heart was trembling!

…

Once he leaped into the abyss, it didn’t take long for him to encounter the middle aged man he’d met with Ye Zhibei and Xing Biqing that day.

The middle aged man gazed at Yang Ye in silence!

Yang Ye smiled embarrassedly, “Senior, long time no see!”

The middle aged man shot a glance upward and gazed at Yang Ye, “Go further down. The Abyss Lord wants to meet you!”

The Abyss Lord!

Yang Ye was shocked, and he wondered who it was!

The middle aged man turned around and descended once he finished speaking.

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and followed him.

Presently, he seemed to have no other choice.

The abyss was much larger than Yang Ye had imagined, and he grew increasingly shocked as he descended further below. As he descended, he saw countless corpses that were floating all around the area, and he saw some treasures too!

Divine treasures!

All of them were divine treasures!

They were just quietly floating there.

Yang Ye was quite tempted by them, but he didn’t try to take them. He knew he should keep a low profile in another’s territory!

Keep a low profile!

Finally, they arrived at the bottom.

Once they arrived at the bottom, the middle aged man bowed slightly toward the distance and vanished on the spot.

Yang Ye gazed into the distance. A young girl in a black plaid dress was standing there. She was just slightly older than Erya, and there were numerous bloody heads around her.

At this moment, she was kicking one of the heads, and it was bouncing rhythmically on her feet.

She glanced at Yang Ye, and then she stopped kicking, causing the head to roll off to the side.

She walked over to a nearby wooden chair, sat on it, and looked down at Yang Ye. She just looked at him in silence!

Yang Ye felt quite awkward, and he hesitated for a moment and said, “Um…”

The young girl suddenly asked, “She isn’t with you?”

Yang Ye gazed at her with bewilderment, “Huh?”

She pointed at the nearby wall, and Yang Ye looked along her finger. A moment later, he was stunned.

He saw something familiar on the wall.

There was a demon beast on the wall. The back half of the demon beast was hidden beneath the darkness, and he could only see its front half. It wasn’t the main point, the main point was the two horns on the top of its head. They were absolutely similar to Erya’s horns!

He’d touched Erya’s horns, so he knew they were exactly the same!

Yang Ye gazed at the young girl, “What…?”

The young girl asked, “Is she not with you?”

Obviously, she was asking about Erya.

Yang Ye nodded, “She went to play somewhere else.”

The young girl frowned slightly, “Play?”

Yang Ye nodded.

The young girl asked, “Play what? Is it fun?”

Yang Ye felt speechless.

She suddenly stood up, and then she appeared before him!

She just appeared out of nowhere!

Yang Ye’s expression instantly became extremely solemn!

Meanwhile, the young girl suddenly stretched out her finger and pointed at Yang Ye’s chest, “Don’t be afraid, I won’t kill you.”

Yang Ye was stunned speechless again.

She pressed her palm against his chest, and then Yang Ye felt like he was frozen on the spot. Moreover, the world within the Primordial Pagoda seemed as if it was locked down by some sort of force!

The entire Primordial Pagoda had been locked down!

Even the pool of light soundlessly hid itself, and there was an arc of electricity left.

A short while later, she removed her palm, “You didn’t lie to me. She really isn’t here!”

She returned to her chair once she finished speaking.

Yang Ye’s body returned to normal, and so did the Primordial Pagoda. He took a deep and long glance at her and said, “You know Erya?”

“Erya?” The young girl was quite curious, “Her name is Erya?”

Yang Ye nodded.

The young girl nodded, “She wasn’t known as Erya in the past!”

Yang Ye hurriedly asked, “Then what was she known as?”

Yang Ye had always been curious about Erya’s origins. Unfortunately, very few knew about it!

The young girl glanced at Yang Ye and said, “She used to be called the Evil Sprite. Didn’t she tell you?”

“The Evil Sprite?” Yang Ye was stunned, “Isn’t she a demon beast?”

The young girl replied with a question, “Did I say she isn’t a demon beast?”

Yang Ye was astounded, “The Evil Sprite is a demon beast?”

The young girl nodded slightly, “The Evil Sprite, the progenitor of all evil. She’s also known as the source of all evil. She isn’t ordinary at all! She’s a type of demon beast, or to be more precise, a type of evil beast. Demon beasts didn’t exist at that time.”

Yang Ye hurriedly asked, “Evil beasts?”

The young girl said, “This world… Right, the Three Dimensional Universe has a law. All things are divided into Yin and Yang, and there is right and wrong as well. You understand that, right?”

Yang Ye blinked and said, “Not really!”

She shook her head and continued, “If there’s Yin, there is Yang. For example, men are Yang and women are Yin. It’s a law of the Three Dimensional Universe, and it’s the Grand Dao all of you speak of. Besides that, there is good and evil. She is the Evil Beast, the progenitor of all evil. It can be said that she is a part of this Three Dimensional Universe. Or it should be said that she’s a part of the Laws of this universe.”

“The Evil Beast!” Yang Ye fell silent for a long time and said, “Then are ordinary people a part of the Three Dimensional Universe?”

She shook her head, “You were born by a person, and she was born from the evil thoughts of this universe itself. Understand?”

Yang Ye was shocked when he heard this, “Y-You’re saying, she is the universe?”

The young girl shook her head, “She is the evil thoughts of the Three Dimensional Universe!”

Yang Ye gulped… Erya’s origins were…

It made him wonder if he should be nicer to her from now on!

Yang Ye seemed to have thought of something and asked, “If evil thoughts exist, there should be good thoughts too. So, is there a Good Sprite?”

She blinked, “Isn’t the Good Sprite with you too?”

Yang Ye was stunned, and then he spoke with astonishment, “Y-You mean… Snowy? Snowy is the universe’s good thoughts?”

“Snowy?” She frowned slightly, “I don’t know what her name is. All I do know is that I sensed her aura from you. But she isn’t complete.”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “What do you mean?”

The young girl said, “According to my knowledge, she was blasted apart into many pieces, and some of them were obliterated. As for the rest, they scattered all over the universe!”

Yang Ye was stunned speechless.

Needless to say, Yang Ye was extremely shocked. Erya was the evil thoughts of the universe, and Snowy was its good thoughts!

Then, there was another problem!

Shouldn’t both of those little fellows be utter enemies? Why were they so close? So close that they could lick the same tanghulu?!

Or perhaps there was a mistake somewhere?

Meanwhile, the young girl said, “Please bring them along if you come again. I want to meet them!”

Yang Ye glanced at her, and then he hesitated for a moment and asked, “Um, do you know them?”

The young girl shrugged, “I know the Erya you mentioned, but I don’t know Snowy. However, since Erya is friends with her, I’m sure I can do the same!”

Yang Ye asked, “Are you friends with Erya?”

She replied with a question, “Can’t I?”

Yang Ye was stunned and hurriedly nodded, “Of course you can. B-But… I’m just really curious about how you two met?”

She replied, “I lost a battle many years ago and almost lost my life. She helped me, so I owe her.”

Yang Ye asked curiously, “Who did you fight?”

She glanced at him, “You ask a little too many questions!”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

She walked off to the side and continued kicking her ball, “I don’t really like being disturbed here, and people who do come here turn to this…”

She pointed at a nearby head.

Yang Ye’s lips twitched. Fortunately, he had Erya. If it wasn’t for Erya, he would probably have suffered a similar fate! ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

The young girl added, “If I let you leave just like this, will you be killed out there? If someone kills you, who will bring her to me? Hmm, I can’t let that happen!”

She gazed at Yang Ye, “I must make you stronger before I let you go!”

Yang Ye blinked, “I-I-I can’t let you help me like that…”
