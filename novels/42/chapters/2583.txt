Chapter 2584

As soon as she finished speaking, Qi Bitian continued kicking her ball as she walked off into the distance.

It didn’t take long for her to vanish.

There was no movement in the sky.

Meanwhile, in a distant place called the Yin World.

At a tower, a middle aged man in a violet gold robe suddenly opened his eyes, and then his eyes gradually turned icy cold. There was undisguised killing intent in them, “No matter who you are, I will kill you!”

The man vanished from the tower once he finished speaking.

…

On the bridge, Qi Bitian walked for a while before she seemed to have thought of something, and then she suddenly looked at the Boundless Water to her right. She still remembered that Madam Yin had asked Yang Ye to go down there.

So, what was down there?

Qi Bitian lightly waved her palms in opposite directions, and the Boundless Water were split apart!

The deathly still waters rose up like two walls and opened up a path.

It didn’t take long for Qi Bitian to notice a golden box.

She waved her right hand, and it entered her grasp.

She scanned it, and then just took it without opening it.

Because the bridge was already shaking violently!

If she stayed a while longer, this world would start to collapse!

Once Qi Bitian vanished, an old man appeared on the bridge. He wore a loose linen robe, and his face was covered in cold sweat.

Horror!

He’d been here from the very beginning, or it should be said that he’d always been guarding the bridge. So, he immediately sensed the battle when it occurred, but when he saw Madam Yin being killed, his heart shuddered.

He was evenly matched with Madam Yin!

But Madam Yin hadn’t been able to fight back at all!

The old man was at a loss for words as he gazed at Madam Yin’s corpse.

…

Meanwhile, the old man from the Demon Blade Sect stopped and put Yang Ye down.

The young saber-wielding man was at the side.

The young man gazed at the old man, “Master?”

The old man gazed at him, “Did you see all of that?”

The young man nodded.

The old man sat by the bridge and said, “Tell me what you think!”

The young man fell silent.

The old man stated, “I asked you a question!”

The young man spoke solemnly, “I think that while that was a prime display of unyieldingness, he was courting death. The gap between their strength was too huge!”

The old man asked, “What would you have done?”

The young man fell silent.

The old man smiled, “You would endure it, right?”

The young man replied solemnly, “Master, there are endless possibilities while you remain alive. If you’re dead, everything becomes meaningless. Of course, I’m not afraid of death, but at a time like that and against an expert like that, fighting to the death isn’t a wise choice.”

The young man gazed at the old man and was feeling slightly nervous.

The old man fell silent for a long time and sighed softly, “Qian Ye, you’re not wrong. He was courting death. Great men should know when to back down, and he was a little too unyielding.”

The young man heaved a sigh of relief, and his mind calmed down.

The old man glanced at Yang Ye. Actually, he hadn’t mentioned something else.

Unyieldingness?

No, that wasn’t what he saw, he saw something deeper!

Relentless!

The young man lying there was relentless and refused to back down before the strong, unfairness, and even death.

The young man’s bones were hard, and so was his sword.

One who never backed down, even in the face of death. If he were being honest, he hadn’t seen someone like that in many, many years.

Never backing down in the face of death wasn’t being unafraid of death. He’d seen many who weren’t afraid of death, like this disciple of his. But at most times, people like his disciple would consider things. Just like what the young man had said earlier. He would have compromised because as far as he was concerned, fighting such an expert was unwise.

Actually, even the old man himself felt that it was unwise to fight back against such an expert!

But this young man had remained unyielding until the end, even in the face of death, the young man had never backed down.

It was something the old man admired, and that was why he’d helped Yang Ye.

He admired Yang Ye, and he wanted to form some goodwill with Yang Ye!

Moreover, he couldn’t stand the sight of Madam Yin either. After all, an extraordinary expert was bullying a young man at the Lord Realm, and that was really beneath experts at their level!

Suddenly, Yang Ye’s hands trembled, and then he slowly opened his eyes.

He looked up at the sky for a long time, and then he suddenly cracked a smile, “So I’m still alive!”

The old man smiled, “That’s a good thing, right?”

Yang Ye gazed at the old man, “Thank you for helping me!”

The old man shook his head, “It was nothing.”

Yang Ye didn’t say anything else. All he knew was that he would remember this kindness.

Yang Ye closed his eyes slowly while the Primordial Violet Energy within him repaired his body, and his body started to recover rapidly.

At this moment, he noticed to his shock that his sword intent was still there!

He clearly remembered that he’d ignited his sword intent. If it were in the past, igniting his sword intent would be equivalent to destroying it to stimulate the potential hidden within him, causing the sword intent to vanish. Yet now, he could clearly sense his sword intent’s presence, and it seemed to be much different than before!

It wasn’t just his sword intent, he noticed that his entire body was slightly different!

As for what was different, he couldn’t put a finger on it!

But at this moment, he didn’t have the time to think too much about it. Because his injuries were truly too severe!

Two hours later, Yang Ye had recovered by almost 50%!

Presently, he didn’t have an endless supply of Primordial Violet Energy, so he had to conserve it when healing himself.

Yang Ye stood up, and the old man scanned him, “How do you feel?”

Yang Ye laughed bitterly, “I’m almost 50% healed.”

The old man nodded, “It’s quite extraordinary. To be honest, I thought you may not make it.”

Yang Ye smiled and didn’t say anything in response. If it wasn’t for the Primordial Violet Energy, he would have really been dead!

Fortunately, the Primordial Violet Energy within him was a product of his own cultivation and didn’t belong to the pagoda, or Qi Bitian would have taken it from him.

Now, he had to conserve it!

The old man sized up Yang Ye again and said, “Kid, you didn’t come here alone, right?” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Yang Ye nodded, “I didn’t!”

The old man said, “Your elders didn’t try to save you earlier!”

Yang Ye laughed bitterly, “You must be joking, Senior. We are here to temper ourselves. If our elders help us, then what results would our tempering even bring? Because if they are there to help, you will have nothing to fear. Under such circumstances, can we ever grow?”

The old man took a deep and long glance at Yang Ye when he heard this, and he said, “Your elders are extraordinary.”

That was what it was to be left to fend for yourself!

While he’d brought his disciple here in the name of tempering his disciple and allowing his disciple to gain experience and grow, he felt that it was nothing before this young man!

After all, if he hadn’t stepped in earlier, his disciple would have died in battle against this young man!

Now that he thought of it, he wondered if his actions would affect his disciple!

Reliance!

Because his disciple would never fear anything at any time. After all, he was always there!

The old man sighed softly and said, “Your elders are truly, truly formidable.”

Formidable?

Yang Ye thought for a moment and said, “Very formidable indeed!”

Qi Bitian grinned and remained silent in the Primordial Pagoda.

The old man glanced at Yang Ye and said, “Heal up. I have something I need your help with later!”

Yang Ye didn’t ask what it was. He just nodded and sat down cross-legged. He stretched out his right hand and said, “Senior, um… can you lend me some World Crystals?”

World Crystals!

He had many of them, but Qi Bitian had taken them all!

The old man shook his head, smiled, and flicked 20 World Crystals to Yang Ye.

“Thank you!” Yang Ye started absorbing them and healing!

Meanwhile, Qian Ye suddenly asked, “Master, maybe… maybe you should go back home?”

Even though Yang Ye hadn’t said anything specifically about him, he’d been moved by what Yang Ye had said just now!

The old man shook his head, “Kid, that method isn’t suited to you.”

Qian Ye was puzzled, “Why?”

The old man didn’t offer any explanation.

Yang Ye could train in this way because his father had done the same to him in the past. He’d crawled up all the way from the very beginning. He wasn’t a tiger raised in a zoo, he was a tiger raised in the mountains!

All that changed was that he’d been brought out of the mountains into an even more brutal place to train!

But Qian Ye was different. He’d grown up in the sect under the watch of all the sect’s experts. He wasn’t even a tiger from the mountains, so leaving him here alone was no different than sending him to his death!

Both of them had grown up in different environments, so they couldn’t be treated in the same way!

Qian Ye glanced at Yang Ye and remained silent.

Meanwhile, the old man suddenly said, “If you really want me to leave, I can do it. Fight him later, and I’ll let you stay here by yourself if you can exchange 100 blows with him!”

Qian Ye’s face was quite unsightly, “Master, while I’m slightly inferior to him, but…”

The old man spoke indifferently, “You think I’m insulting you?”

Qian Ye gazed indifferently at the old man and didn’t say a word.

The old man smiled, “Don’t put on these acts and show me with facts instead.”

Qian Ye grunted coldly and gazed at Yang Ye.

Two hours later, Yang Ye had recovered completely.

Yang Ye stood up. Meanwhile, the old man said, “Young Brother, can you spar with my disciple?”

Young Brother!

Both Yang Ye and Qian Ye hadn’t noticed the subtle change in the old man’s method of address.

Yang Ye glanced at Qian Ye and nodded slightly, “Alright! I want to have a fight too!”

Qian Ye didn’t say anything. He drew his broken saber, and Yang Ye swung his sword.

The old man closed his eyes slowly, “As expected…”

In the Primordial Pagoda, Qi Bitian grinned.
