Chapter 2158 – It’s Only the Beginning!

Continue!

Everyone here had been shocked by what Yang Ye said.

Based on the current situation, Yang Ye’s side was at a disadvantage. So, the best outcome was for the Sovereign of Sky’s group to leave and both sides remain at peace for now. However, they hadn’t expected him to want to fight!

Lin Zhen and the others hadn’t expected it as well!

As far as Yang Ye was concerned, of course they had to fight!

He wasn’t being impulsive!

He was well aware that it was impossible for his side to annihilate the Sovereign of Sky’s group. However, he still wanted to fight. Because he wanted the sky race and all the other races to know that the human race and him weren’t that easy to bully.

I, Yang Ye, and my human race aren’t things you can attack when you please!

It didn’t matter if they couldn’t annihilate everyone here, every single kill counted!

Lin Zhen and the others exchanged glances. In the end, they chose to charge with Yang Ye and An Nanjing. They would naturally not dare to fight if Yang Ye and An Nanjing weren’t here. It was very simple, the human Sages were no match for the Sages of the Alliance of All. But they had the ability to fight back if they had Yang Ye and An Nanjing.

Yang Ye and An Nanjing didn’t split up this time. They charged into the group of Sages, and the Sovereign of Sky’s group didn’t hesitate to attack together.

Since a battle was unavoidable, they had nothing to fear.

The battle was divided into two sides. Yang Ye, An Nanjing, the Sovereign of Sky, and around ten Sages were on one side, and the other Sages from the Alliance of All and Lin Zhen’s group were on the other side.

Yang Ye and An Nanjing stood side by side as they gazed at a Sage on the Sovereign of Sky’s right, “Kill him first.”

As soon as he finished speaking, both of them vanished on the spot.

A moment later, Yang Ye appeared behind the old man.

Backstab!

Meanwhile, An Nanjing appeared before the old man, and Elysium slammed down at him.

The Sovereign of Sky and the others would naturally not just allow Yang Ye and An Nanjing to join forces and crush them one by one. As soon as Yang Ye and An Nanjing attacked, the Sovereign of Sky had appeared before the old man and raised his hands. A wave of powerful energy surged out, and it instantly stopped Elysium. Meanwhile, the other Sages appeared around An Nanjing.

Bang!

In an instant, An Nanjing was blasted back by their joint forces.

As for Yang Ye, he hadn’t been able to instantly kill that Sage. Because he’d similarly been stopped by a few Sages! Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Boom!

Yang Ye was blasted away by a few powerful auras before his sword could even descend. At the same time, around a dozen powerful auras enveloped him and An Nanjing.

An Nanjing suddenly released Elysium, and then she grabbed the ponytail behind her and wrapped it around her face and bit it. Once she did that, she closed her eyes slowly.

Meanwhile, the Sages around her, including the Sovereign of Sky, had solemn expressions on their faces.

After a few collisions, their fear of An Nanjing was even greater than Yang Ye.

Because no matter what, she remained extremely calm, and that was a horrifying state of mind!

Suddenly, An Nanjing opened her eyes. At this moment, faint light flowed around her. A moment later, she walked slowly in their direction, and every step she took made space tremble violently.

An Nanjing stopped abruptly, and then she pressed her palms together and pushed them forward.

Bang!

This attack caused space in a huge area to collapse! At the same time that it collapsed, an extremely powerful aura swept forward like a tornado at the Sovereign of Sky’s group.

The Sovereign of Sky and the others’ expressions changed. They didn’t dare act carelessly and hurriedly calmed themselves. Meanwhile, the Sovereign of Sky took a step forward and waved both his hands before pressing them together. In an instant, two powerful forces appeared out of thin air, and they slammed down upon An Nanjing’s attack like a claw. However, as soon as these three forces came into contact, the Sovereign of Sky’s pincer attack exploded apart!

Meanwhile, An Nanjing suddenly appeared above him. She stretched out her hand and pressed it down.

It seemed like the entire sky had been overturned along with her palm!

The expressions of all the Sages changed drastically.

Suddenly, a sword howl resounded, and then a wave of mysterious energy appeared here.

The Sword Domain!

The expressions of the Sages here changed drastically when they sensed it. They’d placed all their attention on An Nanjing just now, and they’d overlooked Yang Ye. At this moment, they suddenly realized that Yang Ye was here too!

But it was a little too late now.

Around 300m to the Sovereign of Sky’s right, Yang Ye suddenly appeared behind the Sage there, and his sword was stabbed in that Sage’s back. The powerful sword energy it carried instantly blasted that Sage into bits!

Another Sage had fallen!

But that wasn’t the end of it. Yang Ye had vanished again, and afterimages flashed through the area in an instant.

“Watch out!” The Sovereign of Sky suddenly shouted and was about to counterattack. However, An Nanjing arrived above him, and then her foot stomped down from above. The Sovereign of Sky didn’t dare to act carelessly at all. A jade ruler appeared in his grasp once more, and it was the Sky Ruler!

He held it tightly while his profound energy surged madly into it. A moment later, he waved it upward with both hands.

Bang!

A pillar of white light surged up into the sky, and it instantly caused the area to turn ethereal.

Actually, the space here was on the verge of being completely destroyed.

It couldn’t endure a battle between so many Sages!

An Nanjing faced the Sovereign of Sky, and she didn’t act carelessly. Elysium appeared in her grasp, and then it transformed into a beam of light that shot down.

Bang!

As soon as they collided, they exploded apart. The Sovereign of Sky was about to attack again, but he suddenly turned to look toward the side, and another Sage had fallen there.

Another Sage had fallen!

Yang Ye glanced at the Sovereign of Sky, smiled fiercely, and then vanished on the spot.

The Sovereign of Sky’s pupils constricted, and then ferocity flashed through his eyes. He was about to attack Yang Ye when An Nanjing suddenly appeared in front of him.

“Fuck off!” The Sovereign of Sky shouted, and then he slapped his palm at her.

An Nanjing’s face instantly turned icy cold when he shouted at her, and then she hurled Elysium at him.

Hiss!

Elysium tore through the air and instantly destroyed the Sovereign of Sky’s attack. Elysium shot straight through and arrived before the Sovereign of Sky. Meanwhile, a jade rule stopped Elysium.

Meanwhile, An Nanjing and the Sovereign of Sky appeared behind their own weapons. A moment later, An Nanjing kicked Elysium.

Bam!

A powerful wave of force blasted the Sovereign of Sky and his Sky Ruler away.

Meanwhile, An Nanjing didn’t stop. She grabbed Elysium with her right hand, spun on the spot, and then Elysium shot forward like a bolt of lightning. At the same time, she stretched out her right hand and pressed it down in the Sovereign of Sky’s direction. In an instant, a huge palm emerged from the space above the Sovereign of Sky and slammed down.

The Sovereign of Sky’s eyes narrowed slightly. At this moment, he finally realized that he had certainty in being able to defeat An Nanjing when facing her on his own!

In the beginning, he felt that so long as Yang Ye and An Nanjing didn’t join forces, then An Nanjing wouldn’t be a huge threat to him. But now he realized that it wasn’t the case at all!

The Sovereign of Sky restrained his thoughts and closed his eyes slowly. A moment later, rays of white light appeared around him and swept towards the surroundings.

Meanwhile, Elysium and the huge palm had descended upon him!

Rumble!

The entire area shook violently, and some nearby dead planets were instantly obliterated.

Around ten breaths of time later, everything returned to normal. An Nanjing and the Sovereign of Sky were 3km away from each other, and there was a wisp of blood on the corner of his mouth.

He felt a little powerless before An Nanjing!

He couldn’t do anything to her!

However, it was quite difficult for An Nanjing to kill him in a head-on battle too. After all, he was fully vigilant against her right now. The Sovereign of Man had been too careless that day, and coupled with the fact that Yang Ye and An Nanjing had joined forces, that was the only reason why he’d been killed in an instant!

But the Sovereign of Sky clearly refused to make the same mistake!

The Sovereign of Sky glanced at the side, and his heart sank. Yang Ye had killed three Sages now!

Three!

After he activated the Sword Domain, those Sages felt even more powerless against him! Coupled with the fact that Yang Ye was assisted by the Sages of the human race, it could be said that the situation for the Sovereign of Sky’s side would be very, very bad if this continued!

So, the Sovereign of Sky looked up into the sky.

Two old men were sitting facing each other high above in space.

They were the Dao Progenitor and the Buddhist Progenitor.

The Dao Progenitor grinned, “Looks like your side can’t succeed.”

The Buddhist Progenitor nodded, “We underestimated our opponent a little.”

He glanced at An Nanjing and Yang Ye before he continued, “Those two kids aren’t bad, not bad at all. Especially that girl, another Martial God will appear in our large universe soon.”

He stood up and walked away once he finished speaking.

Meanwhile, An Nanjing was about to attack again when 11 bald middle aged men appeared around her. After that, an invisible aura enveloped the surroundings. In an instant, a few dozen rays of golden light shot down at An Nanjing.

Rumble!

Explosions resounded incessantly, and An Nanjing was blasted over 30km away.

An Nanjing had just stopped herself when one of the middle aged men appeared behind her without making a sound. A moment later, he slapped his palm against her back.

Bang!

An Nanjing was blasted away. But this time, she didn’t fly for long before Yang Ye appeared in front of her and took her in his arms. However, the powerful force of the attack still remained, and it pushed both Yang Ye and An Nanjing another 300m away!

As soon as Yang Ye stopped himself, a mouthful of blood sprayed from An Nanjing, and there was a strand of golden flames ceaselessly burning her back!

Yang Ye slowly closed his eyes, and his violet energy surged madly into her. At the same time, he looked into the distance.

11 Sages!

Obviously, they were Sages from the Buddhist Path.

The Buddhist Path had taken action!

Meanwhile, the bald middle aged man who led the ground walked over to Yang Ye and An Nanjing, “Yang Ye, let’s stop today’s spar here.”

Yang Ye raised his hand and swung his sword.

Hiss!

A ray of sword energy instantly blasted the middle aged man over 3km away.

Yang Ye glanced at the middle aged man’s group, and ferocity appeared in his eyes, “Stop it here? No, I think this is just the beginning.”

As soon as he finished speaking, a blood red pearl appeared in front of him.

The Soulblood Pearl!

The Soulblood Pearl which could raise his slaughter intent to the Sage Realm!

A moment later, it entered his forehead.

Boom!

In an instant, the entire area turned blood red.
