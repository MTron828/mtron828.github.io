Chapter 1033 – Lou Qianxiao Is Almost Done!

Even though it hurt to the point he almost lost consciousness, Yang Ye was still able to clearly sense the tiny vortex moving within him!

He knew that it was about to leave him!

What about Su Qingshi and the others who are still in it? Yang Ye’s eyes were filled with a ferocious gaze when he thought up to this point. At this moment, he couldn’t care about anything else and was about to summon Qiong Qi. However, he was astounded to realize that he couldn’t do it. Because a mysterious force had completely sealed off all his strength. So, not to mention his profound energy, he couldn’t even lift a finger!

Bang!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye felt like his head was about to explode, and then it felt heavy as he lost consciousness.

At the same time, the woman suddenly stopped.

As soon as she did, the tiny vortex which had left Yang Ye’s Dantian instantly went right back to where it had been.

She just gazed silent at him.

Suddenly, a wave of ripples appeared in the space behind the woman, and then Asura Queen appeared behind her.

Asura Queen asked, “Master, why have you stopped?”

A long moment of silence ensued before the woman replied, “It has fused with his soul. They live and die together. He’ll die if I take it by force!”

Asura Queen said, “It’s just a lowly human. So what if he dies!”

The woman suddenly turned around to gaze at Asura Queen, but she didn’t speak a word. At the same time, Asura Queen’s delicate figure trembled, and she hurriedly knelt down on the spot.

A long time passed before the woman waved her right hand, and a strand of energy supported Asura Queen up.

Asura Queen glanced at the woman and didn’t dare speak a word.

Meanwhile, the woman turned around to gaze at Yang Ye who’d slumped to the ground, and a long time passed before she said, “Let’s leave!”

Asura Queen said, “But what about the....”

“It’s fine. I’ve suppressed it for now, and I’ll find a way in the future!” As soon as she finished speaking, her figure vanished on the spot.

Asura Queen walked over to Yang Ye once the woman left, and she gazed at Yang Ye for a long time while a trace of coldness gradually appeared in her eyes. However, she didn’t do anything. She just took a deep and long glance at Yang Ye, and then she vanished on the spot.

...

One day later.

Yang Ye’s figure suddenly started moving, and then around an hour passed before Yang Ye opened his eyes slowly. A moment of silence ensued before he sat up swiftly, and then he glanced at the surroundings, “I’m still alive?”

As soon as he said that, Yang Ye seemed to have thought of something and immediately immersed his consciousness into this body.

Yang Ye instantly heaved a sigh of relief when he saw the tiny vortex, and then he fell once more to the ground!

The tiny vortex is fine!It didn’t take long for Yang Ye to frown. Why is it still with me? Did she give up on taking it? Based on her previous attitude, that isn’t very likely. But if she didn’t give up, then did the tiny vortex resist her again? However, it didn’t take long for Yang Ye to refute that thought.

Because the tiny vortex had subdued the Tree of Creation, fought the Eye of the Heaven Dao, and suppressed the Qiong Qi. It could be said to be in an extremely weak state after using its strength so many times. Earlier, it had even tried to stop her at the end, but it had been stopped by the woman. In other words, it was utterly powerless to resist her anymore!

If she refused to give up and the tiny vortex hadn’t resisted, then why did she give up in the end?

Yang Ye pondered deeply for a long time, and then he shook his head and stopped thinking about it. Because it was pointless to think about it right now.

Yang Ye closed his eyes and immersed his consciousness into his body, “I know you can hear me, so let’s have a proper talk today. Firstly, we have to admit that we were both bullied, and we were completely defeated. You admit that, right?”

A moment of silence ensued before the tiny vortex revolved slightly.

Yang Ye continued when he saw the tiny vortex’s response, “I’m not willing to accept that. What about you? Are you willing?”

The tiny vortex spun an entire circle leftwards before spinning an entire circle to the right. Obviously, it was expressing its unwillingness.

“Alright, we’ve come to an agreement!” Yang Ye continued, “Now, let’s talk about how we’ll resolve this. Firstly, you should have realized that it’s pointless no matter how strong you become. Because if I’m not strong, then capturing me is equivalent to capturing you. So, not only do you have to work hard on recovering, you have to help me grow stronger. Of course, I understand that I have to rely on myself to become stronger, but I hope that you try your best to help me if it’s possible!”

After a long moment of silence, 5 rays of golden light suddenly flashed out from within the tiny vortex, and then 5 golden fruits appeared in front of Yang Ye.

Fruits of Creation!

It was the Fruits of Creation the tiny vortex had obtained upon subduing the Tree of Creation that day!

Yang Ye took them, remained silent for quite some time, and then asked, “Can you let me enter the Primordial Pagoda?”

Based on his current strength, he would definitely be able to access the 3rd level of the pagoda if he could enter it. There were definitely things in the 3rd level which could help him. Besides that, the Primordial Pagoda had another ability, and it was the ability to help him conceal himself when his life was in danger.

So long as he could hide in the pagoda, he was confident that even that woman from before would definitely be unable to locate him. Besides that, the Primordial Pagoda was filled with huge amounts of Primordial Violet Energy, and his strength would definitely rise quickly if he could get in the pagoda!

However, Yang Ye was disappointed. Because the tiny vortex spun to the left then right, and Yang Ye knew that it couldn’t. Of course, he knew that the tiny vortex wasn’t doing it on purpose, and it was probably because the tiny vortex had encountered some sort of problem. That was why he couldn’t enter the Primordial Pagoda.

Yang Ye asked solemnly, “What do I do to help you recover?”

The tiny vortex started spinning.

Around 2 hours passed before Yang Ye figured out what it meant. It said that he had to become strong! So long as he grew stronger, it would be able to recover!

In short, its speed of recovery depended on him! UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Yang Ye took a deep breath, and then his gaze descended onto the Fruits of Creation. He remembered that the woman had said that the Fruits of Creation weren’t just able to provide a huge improvement in one’s cultivation, it could improve treasures. That was absolutely heaven defying. Because besides a select few treasures which could grow, the rest had a fixed level of quality, and it was practically impossible to raise their quality. For example, a rock could be sanded down to an extremely smooth rock, but he was still a rock. It couldn’t transform into gold!

But the Fruit of Creation could change the quality of a treasure! If it was true, then it really deserved the name ‘creation’!

Even though he wanted to give it a try, Yang Ye restrained himself in the end. He only had 5 of them, so he couldn’t use them on treasures for now!

Yang Ye raised his head to look towards the direction of Ocean of Clouds City, and then he withdrew a talisman and crushed it. Quite some time passed before ripples arose in the space before him, and then Yu Wushuang’s voice resounded, “I’m finally able to contact you. Where did you go? Are you alright? Where are you now?”

Yang Ye’s heart felt warm when he heard this, and he heaved a slight sigh of relief. Because it seemed like Ocean of Clouds City was fine. He withdrew a talisman and crushed it before he said, “Everything is fine. How’s the city?”

Yu Wushuang replied, “It’s fine for now. Everyone thinks that you’re in closed door cultivation!”

Yang Ye nodded, “I’ll rush back right now!”

“OK!” Yu Wushuang said, “Right, I heard Lou Qianxiao is almost done with his closed door cultivation. Supposedly, Sky Divine Hall has already started preparing his wedding. The person he’s marrying seems to be An Nanjing and an elder of Sky Divine Hall, Mu Hanshan!”

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed when he heard this, and he pondered deeply for a long time before he crushed another transmission talisman, “Alright. It’ll take me a day at most to get back!”

Yang Ye’s face was utterly gloomy as he finished speaking.

“Marry An Nanjing? You’re going to be an eunuch!” Yang Ye’s figure vanished into the sky once he finished speaking.

...

Ocean of Clouds City. Outside the city.

Two men in white robes and a woman in a moon white dress suddenly appeared not too far from the city.

“Kaiyang Jun, that’s Ocean of Clouds City!” The man on the left who had a sword hanging on his waist gazed at the city and smiled, “Even though it’s quite small, it’s not bad. In any case, we’re just having fun!”

The man in the center of the group glanced at the man with a sword, “Qin Yuan, we aren’t here to have fun. The elders gave us an assignment, and we’ll definitely have to suffer from now on if we can’t finish it. We’ll definitely suffer a huge reduction to the resources we gain every month.”

“You think that we can’t finish that assignment?” The man called Qin Yuan chuckled, “It’s an extraordinary kindness to them, isn’t it?”

“I heard that Ocean of Clouds Academy has a dean!” The woman in their group spoke abruptly, “It seems to be a young man called Yang something....”

“Yang Ye?” Qin Yuan continued, “I inquired about him earlier, and he has gained a little reputation here. Right, I heard he’s extremely arrogant!”

The man called Kaiyang Jun suddenly chuckled, “How arrogant?”

Qin Yuan said, “I heard he likes to fight as soon as there’s even a tiny dispute!”

Kaiyang Jun chuckled, “What an ignorant fool. He’s nothing to be afraid of!”

The woman said, “What if he refuses?”

“Isn’t that easy to resolve? We’ll just kill him!” A cold smile arose on the corners of Qin Yuan’s mouth as he took a few steps forward, and then he raised his right hand and pointed it ahead. As soon as he did that, the sword on his waist transformed into a ray of light that shot swiftly forward.

A ray of light flashed by and the city gates exploded into pieces!

“From this moment onward, we’ll be taking over Ocean of Clouds Academy and Ocean of Clouds City!” Qin Yuan’s voice resounded through the air above the city!
