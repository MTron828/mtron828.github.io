Chapter 2442 – Sky Lord!

The Mad Demon Bloodline!

At this point in their battle, both sides had their rage blazing to the max. Both Yang Ye and the Desthguard stopped holding back.

Once Yang Ye’s madness intent arose, he suddenly vanished on the spot.

Bang!

An instant later, a ray of blood red sword energy flashed, and then the Deathguard was blasted over 30km away!

The Deadguard slammed against the ground, and his body immediately cracked open. Countless strands of blood sprayed from his body.

The Deathguard looked up at Yang Ye who’d entered into an insane state, and there was a vicious and ferocious glow in his eyes.

The Deathguard ignored his heavy injuries and stomped his right foot down, transforming into a ray of saber energy that shot at Yang Ye.

Bang!

As soon as he arrived before Yang Ye, his figure was blasted away once more.

This time, his body exploded apart and only his soul remained!

However, the Deathguard didn’t flee like the experts he’d faced in the past. The Deathguard raised his hands and formed an ethereal and translucent saber.

He stared at Yang Ye while an endless stream of Soul Energy converged into the saber.

Desolate Deathguards only died in battle and did not escape it!

The Deathguard’s soul suddenly started burning slightly!

Soul Ignition!

Obviously, the Deathguard planned to ignite his soul to unleash his strongest attack!

Suddenly, a voice resounded, “Step down.”

As soon as he finished speaking, a ray of white light entered the Deathguard’s soul, and then the flames around his soul instantly vanished. The Deathguard didn’t attack again. He just took a knee and bowed toward the sky, and then he left.

However, Yang Ye was in a state of madness right now, so he didn’t know how to stop.

Yang Ye tapped his right foot down and soared up into the air like a rock, and the Sword Precursor left behind a string of blood red afterimages as it shot through the sky like a gorgeous bloody glow!

Right at the instant Yang Ye attacked, a middle aged man in a luxurious robe appeared in front of Yang Ye. The middle aged man gazed at Yang Ye with a spurious smile, “interesting!”

Yang Ye didn’t care who it was and just swung his sword.

Hiss!

It sliced open the fortified space here.

Once he entered into a state of madness, Yang Ye’s overall strength had improved tremendously, especially his Sword Dao. Actually, even in the mortal world, if someone went mad to do something, then it would be extremely terrifying, regardless of what it was.

However, this attack which sliced through space with ease had been stopped by a pair of fingers!

The middle aged man’s fingers!

Yang Ye’s sword shook violently, but it didn’t take long to calm down. However, no matter how much force Yang Ye used, it wouldn’t move at all!

So, Yang Ye just released the sword and slammed a punch forward instead.

It shot straight for the middle aged man’s face!

The man grinned slightly. He took Sword Precursor in his hand and used its hilt to strike Yang Ye’s fist.

Bam!

Yang Ye was blasted almost 30km away!

Yang Ye descended to the ground but wasn’t injured, not even in the slightest! However, a huge expanse of space behind him suddenly turned pitch black.

That expanse of space had been obliterated.

Meanwhile, the middle aged man shook his hand slightly, and the Sword Precursor descended before Yang Ye.

He said, “Continue!”

Yang Ye raised the Sword Precursor again, but he didn’t attack the middle aged man. His figure shot over to the Deathguard who was still in fierce combat against Huang Ying!

Yang Ye may have gone insane, but he could still sense if he was a match for his opponent.

If he wasn’t a match, then flee he would!

Was it embarrassing? Perhaps it was. But it was better than losing his life!

The middle aged man was quite stunned to see Yang Ye do that, and then he shook his head and smiled, “That won’t do!” As soon as he finished speaking, he appeared before Yang Ye and tapped a finger at Yang Ye.

It was a very ordinary tap!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye’s sword shot forward, but his sword was Executor now!

Five swings with the Sword Domain!

At the moment Yang Ye’s fifth swing descended, a wisp of surprise flashed through the middle aged man’s eyes, but he didn’t pull his finger back.

Bang!

The middle aged man took a few steps back, but Yang Ye had been blasted over 30km away. Just like before, he wasn’t injured at all!

The middle aged man glanced at his finger, and there was a small speck of blood red. It had been left behind by Executor!

The middle aged man chuckled, “As expected of Eternal Kingdom’s number one sword. It can even pierce through my defenses.”

Meanwhile, Yang Ye appeared in front of him, and then Yang Ye swung Executor madly with both hands.

The Madness Sword Technique!

Every single swing of the sword descended upon the same spot. In a breath of time, Yang Ye had swung his sword no less than 100 times, but the middle aged man had stopped them all.

Moreover, the middle aged man had only taken a single step back.

However, Yang Ye didn’t stop and continued swinging his sword madly. It was like he was venting, and the middle aged man merely defended himself without attacking. Just like that, around two hours passed before Yang Ye was exhausted.

However, he was still swinging!

During these two hours, he’d been swinging 100 times per breath of time, so how many times had he swung his sword in two hours?

The middle aged man had never fought back throughout this time and just allowed Yang Ye to attack him.

An hour later, Yang Ye stopped and lied on the group while gasping for air. At this moment, the madness intent around him had vanished, and he’d returned to normal!

Yang Ye closed his eyes. He was truly exhausted now.

However, he’d really fought to his heart’s content, he truly had. Because he’d never fought like this in the past. Before this, practically all his enemies took just a single swing of the sword or two at most. Yet now, the middle aged man had merely defended himself and allowed Yang Ye to unleash everything to his heart’s content. It was something Yang Ye hadn’t experienced in a very, very long time.

Meanwhile, A’Leng and Huang Ying stopped. It wasn’t that they wanted to stop fighting, it was because their opponents had stopped fighting.

The Deathguards just stood silently behind the middle aged man.

Huang Ying glanced at the middle aged man, hesitated for a moment, and asked, “Are you the Sky Lord?”

The middle aged man glanced at Huang Ying and smiled, “While you’re not the best among the princes, you’re not bad.”

Huang Ying instantly revealed a solemn expression on his face when he heard the middle aged man admit it.

The Sky Lord!

He was a figure from the Desolate Emperor’s time! All the Deathguards of the desolate race had been taught and managed by the Sky Lord. It could be said that he was their leader! Moreover, his identity was very special too. It could be said that he only obeyed the Desolate Emperor. Even the Crown Prince had no authority to command him. Of course, while they couldn’t make him do anything, they could command the Desolate Deathguards!

Huang Ying laughed bitterly, “If you’re going to act against us, then I can only admit defeat!”

Just as he’d said, if the Sky Lord and Desolate Deathguard had picked sides, and it wasn’t his side, then he would have no choice but to admit defeat. Because unless the Desolate Emperor or that other existence in the desolate race took his side, he would have no chance at winning!

The Sky Lord shook his head, “I don’t want to interfere in your competitions. These brothers of mine merely came here to test your strength. Simply speaking, this was a test. My desolate race only respects the strong, but these friends of yours have entered the Desolate World without permission. Under normal circumstances, they should die. But since you brought them here, they can be allowed to enter, but the necessary tests cannot be avoided.”

He glanced at A’Leng and Yang Ye, “Welcome to the Desolate World.”

A'Leng nodded slightly and remained silent.

As for Yang Ye, he was still lying there.

Sky Lord glanced at Yang Ye and smiled, “Your battle with my desolate race’s Deathguard was a fair battle, and you didn’t use any external sources of strength. So, it can be considered as your win. But I interfered. That was unfair to you. Thus, I thought for a while and decided to compensate you, and that is why I acted as your sparring partner for so long. I presume you’ve gained quite a bit from that. Farewell!”

As he spoke, he gazed at Huang Ying, “It isn’t that easy to become the Crown Prince. The three of you will probably find the next stage very difficult to overcome.”

Huang Ying laughed bitterly, “What else can I do at this point? Give up?”

Sky Lord smiled, “The Crown Prince isn’t a form of authority, it’s responsibility. The Crown Prince shoulders the responsibility of my desolate race’s future, so normal people can’t be the Crown Prince. Do you understand what I mean?”

Huang Ying shook his head, “Not really!”

Sky Lord chuckled, “Alright, that’s enough. Good luck!”

He vanished on the spot with the other Deathguards.

Huang Yin fell silent for a moment, and then he went to Yang Ye’s side, “Brother Yang, are you alright?”

Yang Ye opened his eyes, glanced at them, and shook his head slightly.

Sky Lord had only defended himself and had not attacked. So, besides being completely exhausted, Yang Ye hadn’t been injured at all. As for the injuries he suffered from the Deathguard with the saber, it had been healed by his Primordial Violet Energy a long time ago.

Huang Ying nodded, “Let’s rest for now!”

Yang Ye closed his eyes slowly and entered the Primordial Pagoda.

Yang Ye went to the cultivation room.

Absorb!

He’d comprehended too, too much during that battle.

Bloodline!

He’d gained a faint understanding of what the energy of the bloodline represented!L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Outside the Primordial Pagoda, An Nanjing appeared where Yang Ye had been.

She held a spear in her hand and had an indifferent expression on her face.

It was quite dangerous once Yang Ye entered the Primordial Pagoda. If someone attacked the space he resided at, he was very likely to be caught off guard.

So, An Nanjing had clearly come outside to protect him!
