Chapter 2650 – You’re Shameless!

Revenge! He naturally had to get revenge!

Especially after he saw the state Nether Maiden and the others were in. It felt like his heart was being stabbed.

It seemed like it never ended well for anyone by his side.

Sky Maiden wanted him to give up on revenge for now, and Jian Wudi was of the same mind. Because they knew that he couldn’t fight the End World right now.

They were naturally not wrong, he was no match for the End World right now.

However, he still came here.

He wasn’t here to court death, and he was just here to get justice for Nether Maiden and the others. As for whether he could defeat them, it didn’t matter. He had to fight first to find out.

It didn’t take long for Yang Ye to enter the End World.

As soon as she arrived within the End World, the Divine Abode’s master appeared before him.

The latter frowned slightly upon seeing Yang Ye, and there was vigilance in his eyes.

If Yang Ye dared to come here on his own, something was definitely off.

The Divine Abode’s master was about to say something when Yang Ye suddenly appeared before him, and then a sword stabbed at him.

Heaven Executor!

At this moment, it wasn’t the same sword anymore.

Its strength had completely exceeded Yang Ye’s expectations.

Besides his own attainments in the Sword Dao, the sword itself carried a form of mysterious energy as it shot forward.

Heaven Executor was a sword that had once executed the Heaven Dao.

Past Life was extremely potent against all living things, and its energy of Past Life could disperse the souls of all things. Heaven Executor, on the other hand, was extremely potent against the heavens.

The space throughout the End World shook violently before this sword, and the space in a huge area around Yang Ye instantly turned ethereal.

If Yang Ye was slightly stronger, it would have been able to destroy the quintessence of the End World!

Everyone in the End World was shocked by this attack.

The most shocked was the Divine Abode’s master. He’d naturally seen Yang Ye use this sword in the past. However, its strength wasn’t anything like what it used to have!

The Divine Abode’s master’s reaction was extremely fast. At the instant Yang Ye stabbed his sword forward, the Divine Abode’s master stabbed his pike forward.

They clashed!

If he was facing Jian Wudi, then he may choose to avoid battle, but he was facing Yang Ye, so he never had such a thought.

Just like that, the sword and pike slammed directly against each other.

Hiss!

Along with the sound of something being sliced open, the Divine Abode’s master’s expression changed drastically. It was because his pike had been sliced apart!

It had been sliced apart by a swing of Yang Ye’s sword!

The Divine Abode’s master decisively abandoned the pike and flashed over 1km back.

However, countless cracks still appeared on his right hand that was holding the pike, and blood seeped out incessantly from them.

He was naturally able to discern that while Yang Ye was at the Destiny Realm, there was quite a huge gap between them. The truly terrifying part about that last attack was the energy emanated by the sword itself and not Yang Ye’s own Sword Dao!

At this moment, Yang Ye had noticed how special his sword was.

He glanced at the surroundings and was about to swing his sword again. However, a wave of powerful pressure enveloped him, and then countless divine senses and auras slammed down from all directions.

The other experts of the End World had taken action!

At this moment, Yang Ye didn’t swing his sword, and he just used the Myriad World Diagram to escape the End World.

Even though the Myriad World Diagram couldn’t teleport him into the End World, he could use it to teleport to the outside world.

The experts of the End World were stunned when Yang Ye suddenly vanished.

What the heck is going on?

A short while later, a voice resounded in the sky, “Don’t let him get away!”

The Divine Abode’s master spoke solemnly, “Lord Wangu, his sword…”

“Heaven Executor!” Heng Wangu explained, “It’s the sword of one of the forms of Destiny. I didn’t expect it to have fallen into his hands… He must be eliminated. Lead a group outside and eliminate him.”

The Divine Abode’s master frowned slightly. Kill Yang Ye? If he was being honest, he was really not afraid of Yang Ye before this, but that madman had that sword now, so he wasn’t that easy to kill anymore. Moreover, Yang Ye may even kill him instead!

Heaven Progenitor wasn’t something a Super Divine Treasure could resist!

“You’re afraid?” Meanwhile, Heng Wangu spoke abruptly.

The Divine Abode’s master shook his head, “Allow me to be honest, we’re probably unable to kill him anymore.”

That clash with Yang Ye allowed him to realize that Yang Ye wasn’t the same Yang Ye he knew. Moreover, Jian Wudi and that mysterious woman, Sky Maiden, were still out there. They were naturally unafraid of Yang Ye’s group within the End World, but once they went outside, it would be like entering into the territory of Yang Ye’s group.

But the top figures of the End World didn’t dare to go outside because of Destiny!

Simply speaking, the End World was in quite an aggrieving state!

Those who were truly strong enough to kill Yang Ye feared Destiny and didn’t dare to rashly leave this place, and those who could go outside may not be able to kill him!

Suddenly, something unexpected occurred!

A wave of mysterious suction force appeared within the End World, and along with its arrival, the spirit energy in the entire End World started to vanish rapidly!

The Sprite Progenitor!

The Divine Abode’s master’s expression changed drastically. It was obvious that Yang Ye and the Sprite Progenitor were behind this!

A short moment later, the Divine Abode’s master and some other peak Destiny Realm experts in the End World left the place.

The End Dimension.

At this moment, Yang Ye was standing before the teleportation formation which led to the End World, and Snowy was madly absorbing the spirit energy coming from the formation.

Suddenly, Yang Ye’s expression changed slightly. He hurriedly grabbed Snowy and moved 300m back. A moment later, the Divine Abode’s master and the others appeared before him.

A total of seven experts!

Some of them were familiar faces like the Divine Abode’s master, Shui Wubian, Cang Hua, and Xu Yue… Practically all who’d fought Qi Bitian and Tian Xiu that day in the Origin World were here!

Yang Ye grinned, “You really think highly of me!”

Yang Ye told Snowy to enter the primordial Pagoda, and then he walked slowly in their direction with Heaven Executor in hand.

All of their faces turned solemn when they witnessed this, and they started scanning the surroundings vigilantly.

As far as they were concerned, Yang Ye would absolutely not dare to be so arrogant if he didn’t have help!

Suddenly, a sword howl resounded, and then a ray of sword energy shot at them.

A wisp of ridicule curled up on their mouths when they saw this.

If he didn’t have any help, then Yang Ye was really overestimating his strength by doing this!

The Divine Abode’s master suddenly said, “Join forces and don’t give him any chances!”

As soon as he gave the order, seven terrifying auras swept out. They instantly stopped Yang Ye on the spot, and even blasted Yang Ye far away!

Even if Yang Ye used his dual Domains and dual intents, he still couldn’t resist their joint forces!

It was normal because even existences as strong as Tian Xiu and the Desolate Emperor didn’t possess the strength to fight seven of them on their own, let alone someone like Yang Ye who’s just attained the Destiny Realm!

Yang Ye wiped off the blood on the corner of his mouth and glanced at Heaven Executor. If it wasn’t for this sword, he would have died from that attack. Fortunately, now he had a clear understanding of his strength and the strength of his enemies.

He was no match for them!

Yang Ye turned around and fled!

The Divine Abode’s master and the others were stunned when they saw him run, and then they chased after him.

Perhaps they couldn’t kill Yang Ye if they fought him one on one, but it wouldn’t be a problem if they ganged up on him!

Just like that, Yang Ye fled madly while they chased him all the way. It didn’t take long for him to arrive at Eternal Kingdom!

Meanwhile, the Divine Abode’s master and the others chased him to Eternal Kingdom too!

Once Yang Ye and the others arrived at Eternal Kingdom, the leaders of all the powers in Eternal Kingdom had extremely unsightly expressions on their faces.

If Yang Ye and the others were to fight in Eternal Kingdom, it would be a calamity for the place.

At this moment, countless powers of Eternal Kingdom wished for nothing more than to tear Yang Ye apart!

That madman just had to come to Eternal Kingdom?!

Obviously, he’d done it on purpose!

The Divine Abode’s master and the others clearly understood Yang Ye’s objective as well. But at this moment, they didn’t care about that. They just wanted to kill him!

Yang Ye stopped upon fleeing to the Central Region, and then he turned around to face his pursuers.

The Divine Abode’s master stared at Yang Ye, “What tricks are you up to now?!”

Yang Ye cracked a smile, “Do you remember how the Desolate Emperor died?”

The Divine Abode’s master’s eyes narrowed slightly, “What are you trying to say?”

“What am I trying to say?” Yang Ye chuckled, “The Desolate Emperor died because he almost destroyed Eternal Border and wanted to destroy Eternal Kingdom too. Right, once we start fighting, I hope you don’t hold back. Give it all you’ve got. It’s alright if you destroy this world. Yes, it’s definitely alright. Haha!”

The Divine Abode’s master and the others instantly revealed extremely unsightly expressions on their faces.

Suddenly, Yang Ye charged at them.

Fight!

They immediately attacked upon seeing Yang Ye charge at them!

Or it should be said that before they even attacked, just their auras had pushed Yang Ye back, and when they did attack, their powerful energy rippled out into the surroundings. It didn’t cause much damage to Yang Ye, but the world around them shook violently.

This world couldn’t endure their combined strength.

The End World was fortified by those old geezers, so the space there was extremely stable. Moreover, it was a place that could conceal them from the workings of the heavens, it was a place Destiny couldn’t sense. But this place didn’t have those conditions!

How strong was their combined strength?Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Moreover, Yang Ye was using Heaven Executor!

Under such circumstances, this world couldn’t endure their battle at all!

As soon as they saw the world starting to turn ethereal, all of them started to panic a little.

What would they do if Destiny actually showed herself?

The Divine Abode’s master has an unsightly expression on his face as he watched Yang Ye charge at them, “You’re shameless!”
