Chapter 2758 – Destiny’s Hostility!

The Ordinary Sword!

Yang Ye hadn’t truly attained the realm of the Ordinary Sword because both him and the Sword Precursor’s attainments weren’t sufficient. However, he’d comprehended the essence of the Ordinary Sword, so all he needed was a fortuitous encounter to accomplish it.

Of course, that wasn’t the most important part.

The most important part was that his mind was clear, and he understood everything.

Yang Ye waved his right hand, and the Sword Precursor turned around and returned to him. A moment later, a blood red woman appeared before him.

She gazed at him, and then the blood red on her gradually faded. A short while later, she was normal again.

Yang Ye smiled, “Congratulations!”

She shook her head, didn’t say a word, and just transformed into a sword that entered the sheath on Yang Ye’s waist.

Companionship!

She’d been by his side for countless years!

Silently staying by him!

Yang Ye chuckled and vanished on the spot.

Outside the Primordial Pagoda.

Yang Ye arrived at a hall. It was known as Universe Hall, and it was the most authoritative hall in the entire Three Dimensional Universe!

A single command from her would be obeyed and executed by countless worlds and powers.

There was a figure working in the hall, Ding Shaoyao.

Ding Shaoyao could be considered as the busiest person in this universe. Because she had to manage too, too many things. In the beginning, the others doubted her ability, but because she had been recommended by Yang Ye, no one said a thing about it.

However, they gradually started to be won over by her.

She was a truly capable person!

Besides that, the power that stood behind her and the bodyguards Yang Ye gave her made her an overlord in this city!

Even though the universe was united on the surface, there were still numerous powers in the city. It was something unavoidable.

Ding Shaoyao glanced at Yang Ye and continued her work.

Yang Ye walked over to her, and she was reviewing something.

Meanwhile, Ding Shaoyao said, “There are too many things to do in this universe. I want to establish a department, an independent department, and then recruit people to help with all of this. We don’t need strong experts for this and even ordinary people can do it. However, they must have status and protection. Do you have any objections?”

Yang Ye smiled, “Of course you can.”

Ding Shaoyao nodded, “I’ve already given the order. Besides that, there are some empires and kingdoms throughout the universe, and while they have agreed to yield to us, we can’t really interfere in their internal affairs, nor do we dare to interfere. After all, if our people don’t act neutrally, it may bring a calamity to the empire or kingdom in question.”

She looked at him and asked, “What do you think?”

Yang Ye fell silent for a short while and replied, “How about we don’t interfere in their internal affairs. However, we will supervise them. Remember, we’re only supervising, not interfering. If any empire or kingdom is too chaotic, we still must not interfere immediately. A request should be made here, and then someone should be sent to investigate. In the end, the final decision will be made here. What do you think?”

Ding Shaoyao pondered deeply for a moment and nodded, “Alright!”

She gazed at Yang Ye and continued, “Everything is almost over, right?”𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Yang Ye nodded, “It should be.”

She fell silent.

Yang Ye turned around and walked outside. He gazed at the entire city.

Presently, the entire Three Dimensional Universe had been organized and it was time for it to all be over!

Bang!

Suddenly, an invisible wave of pressure appeared in the city.

At this moment, everyone here was shocked and looked up.

A sword gradually descended from above.

A dark green sword!

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly when he saw it.

Justice!

It was the strongest form of Destiny’s sword, Justice!

Yan Wu, Jian Wudi, and the others appeared in front of Yang Ye, and Yan Wu spoke solemnly, “That’s the other sword of Destiny, the strongest one. Brother Yang…”

Yang Ye spoke softly, “Just stand on guard here and don’t go up there.”

As soon as he finished speaking, a ray of sword energy shot up into the air.

Countless looked up at the sword energy from within the city.

Worry!

After experiencing times of war, everyone in Eternal Kingdom had learned to cherish this peace that didn’t come easy. Especially now when the entire universe was living in harmony, and the spirit energy here was abundant!

No one wanted to lose all of this!

However, they were all well-aware that the young man who’d just shot up into the sky was the one who was maintaining it all.

He set the new rules, a brand new order.

If he died, this world would be back to square one.

Even Yan Wu and the other Destiny Realm experts were extremely worried. If Yang Ye died, they would naturally be the strongest experts here. However, once Yang Ye died, this group of theirs would lose its foundation. Even if they didn’t disperse immediately, problems would definitely arise, sooner or later.

So, even they didn’t want anything to happen to Yang Ye!

He was the only person who could maintain the order of this universe!

In the sky, Justice was still descending slowly while an endless wave of aura descended with it. If the sword went just 300m lower, the entire city would collapse!

Sword aura!

He'd witnessed the auras of the woman in black and the woman in white, and he’d experienced Tu’s aura as well. However, none of them were as strong as this!

It seemed like the aura could destroy everything!

Yang Ye gazed at the sword with indifference.

A wave of invisible sword intent and pressure suddenly swept out from him, and then it stopped the aura emanated by Justice. At the same time, his sword left its sheath.

A sword howl resounded, and a sword stabbed against the tip of Justice.

Boom!

The sky shook violently, and then Justice was forced to a stop.

Suddenly, Justice shook, and then the Sword Precursor crashed down from midair.

Yang Ye stretched out his hand and it firmly entered his grasp.

Yang Ye looked up, and a woman was standing above Justice. A woman in a dark green dress.

The strongest form of Destiny!

While she seemed material, it still wasn’t her main body.

She looked down at Yang Ye while a bright smile still lingered on her face, “You’re showing signs of attaining the Ordinary Sword. You’ve surprised me a little.”

Yang Ye took a step forward, and he instantly arrived before her. He looked her in the eyes and said, “I’m sure you’re not here just to sightsee. So, what do you want?”

She grinned, glanced at the city down below, and said, “You’re quite capable. You actually gathered all of these people and powers together. Unfortunately, it’s meaningless.”

“Why is it meaningless?” Yang Ye replied with a question, “Don’t you think it’s all quite nice?”

She smiled, “Yang Ye, oh, Yang Ye! You think everything is so simple. Do you know why all of you can live peacefully in this universe? It’s because we are holding off the pressure from the outside. However, all of you are full of hostility toward us instead. For example, you want to kill me, and they want to kill us… Tell me, aren’t you repaying kindness with enmity?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “My intuition tells me that you aren’t protecting the Three Dimensional Universe.”

She was unlike the others. The woman in white and the others were definitely wholeheartedly protecting this universe, but the woman before him felt like she wasn’t someone who cared about the universe and all those who lived in it.

Once someone like that attained a certain level of strength, their thoughts and actions would differ from ordinary people.

She gazed at him for a long time and grinned. It was quite a moving smile. She said, “You’re right, but you get nothing for that!”

Yang Ye fell silent for a moment and said, “The universe is gradually stabilizing, and it’s starting to develop in a good direction. So, can you let it be?”

She shook her head, “If it wasn’t for me, this universe would be gone by now. I’m only protecting it because it’s a little useful to me.”

She gazed at Yang Ye and continued, “I’ll give you a chance. Want to hear it?”

Yang Ye nodded, “Tell me about it!”

She smiled, “The chance is to give me the Good Sprite and Evil Beast!”

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly, “You’re already so strong, so why do you want to do as that mysterious expert and rely on other living beings to strengthen yourself?”

She shook her head, “No, no. I don’t want to use their strength, I just need something. This thing lacks a sprite, and I think they will make the perfect combination for it. Yin and Yang; Heaven and Earth; Malevolent and Righteous… I have all of those. I only lack Good and Evil. However, they are still quite weak, so I’m willing to wait!”

Yang Ye looked her in the eyes, “I’ll kill you!”

She smiled, and it was a very calm smile!

She shook her head, “A very, very long time ago. Too, too many people had the same thought as you. For example, Qi Bitian and Yang Busi who you think are very, very formidable. No, they actually can’t be considered to be formidable, there are those who are even more formidable than them. All of them were of the same mind as you. But what happened in the end?”

As she spoke, she walked over to him, “Do you know why I didn’t kill some people? It’s not that I couldn’t kill them, it’s because it would be too boring if I did.”

Yang Ye fell silent.

She looked down and chuckled, “Since all of you are hostile toward me… It’s fine, you can feel my hostility too!”

As soon as she finished speaking, she waved her right hand.

Justice shot up into the air!

Hiss!

The sword tore through the sky. An instant later, it seemed like something was being sliced open.

A moment later, everyone’s expressions change.

There were nine heavens which represented the nine layers of space. But at this moment, along with Justice shooting up into the air, all nine layers of space were sliced into bits.

Meanwhile, numerous mysterious eyes soundlessly appeared where the 9th layer of space had been. These eyes looked down at the Three Dimensional Universe. However, they seemed to fear something and only dared to look yet didn’t dare to come closer.

She gazed at Yang Ye, “That’s the barrier I once set up for the Three Dimensional Universe. Now, it’s gone. So, let me see how all of you protect this universe now.”

Yang Ye looked her in the eye, “From this moment onward, we will protect the Three Dimensional Universe.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye looked down and howled with fury, “Send word to the entire universe. Everyone who can fight better get themselves to Universe City. Let’s show this woman that we can still survive even without her!”
