Chapter 120 – The Entrance Is Open

“Little Brother, you wanted to kill that woman from before?” Qin Xiyue gazed at Yang Ye as she asked in a serious tone.

Yang Ye was slightly surprised because he’d concealed his killing intent very well at that time, and he’d never expected that this woman would have noticed it. So, he didn’t conceal it and nodded.

Qin Xiyue said in a low voice, “Little Brother, Big Sister doesn’t know what sort of enmity you have with her, or the Flower Palace. But Big Sister wants to tell you that even if you want to kill her, you can’t do it openly, and it’s the same for the Origin School. Because once you kill them, or their sects find out about it, then you’ll definitely face serious consequences!”

“What if they were the ones that attacked first?” said Yang Ye with a smile on his face.

“It’s still the same!” Qin Xiyue said, “Unless your backing isn’t inferior to the Flower Palace and Origin School!”

Yang Ye smiled and didn’t speak further. Actually, when that disciple of the Origin School attacked earlier, he was already prepared to end Gong Yuan and Su Xiaoxiao.

Unfortunately, he was obstructed by Qin Xiyue. Obviously, Qin Xiyue had discerned his intentions. So, she was utterly not saving him when she attacked, and she was saving the pair of man and woman that stood before him instead.

Even though his cultivation was only at the ninth rank of the Mortal Realm, if he executed the Gale Steps technique, utilized the boost from the Swift Shows and Sword Intent, and launched a surprise attack, then he was extremely confident in his ability to end one of them with a single strike of the sword. But it was very obvious that Qin Xiyue didn’t want him to do it here. However, he didn’t mind because he had many more chances after they entered the Tomb of Emperor Zhou.

Yang Ye shook his head and stopped thinking about all of this, and then he closed his eyes and awaited the arrival of the person that would open the tomb. Earlier, he found out from the conversations of the others that someone would come to open the Tomb of Emperor Zhou, and all he had to do now was wait!

Qin Xiyue glanced at Su Xiaoxiao who was chatting intimately with Gong Yuan, and then she glanced at Yang Ye before her eyes lowered while she seemed to be in deep contemplation about something.

“Senior Brother Wei Ran, is he really Yang Ye?” At the entrance of the imperial palace, one of the disciples from the Sword Sect asked the senior brother that stood before him.

The young man called Wei Ran nodded and said, “After he instantly annihilated Liu Qingyu with a single strike of the sword that day, he didn’t make another appearance in the Sword Sect. I never expected that he actually came here.”

“Did he really instantly annihilate Liu Qingyu who was already at the First Heaven Realm?” The tone of the young man that asked the question earlier carried slight doubt.

Wei Ran glanced at Yang Ye with a complicated gaze and said, “I witnessed it with my own two eyes. According to Senior Brother Qin Feng, Yang Ye hadn’t even utilized his full strength when he fought Liu Qingyu that day. Moreover, Senior Brother Qing Feng also said that if Yang Ye challenged the Outer Court Rankings at that time, then it would definitely not be a problem for Yang Ye to enter the top 10 with his strength. Of course, he’s probably the first now.”

Yang Ye was naturally not an unfamiliar face to all of them who used to be Outer Court Disciples because Yang Ye was an existence that possessed a potential that surpassed the ‘Demonic Woman’.

“The first on the Outer Court Rankings!” The young man said in a low voice, “In other words, he can be considered as the number one expert in our Sword Sect’s outer court?”

“Not to mention the outer court, there are probably numerous Inner Court Disciples that aren’t a match for him!” said Wei Ran in a heavy voice.

That young man from before asked. “Senior Brother Wei Ran, should we go over and greet him?”

Wei Ran hesitated for a moment before he shook his head and said, “He ought to have noticed us earlier. Since he didn’t come to greet us, then I think he doesn’t want to have anything to do with us or he can’t for some reason. So, we should just wait and see.”

...

Along with the gradual passage of time, more and more people arrived here, and a sea of people had formed in the square before the entrance to the imperial palace. There were at least over 10,000 people here, and besides the Origin School, Flower Palace, and Sword Sect, there were also disciples from the Grand Qin Empire’s Imperial Academy and the various clans in the empire.

Suddenly, the eyes of Yang Ye who was originally meditating with his eyes closed had opened, and then he stretched out his hand to pull Qin Xiyue’s hand before he turned around and headed towards a specific direction.

Even though Qin Xiyue didn’t understand why Yang Ye would suddenly do this, she didn’t resist and allowed Yang Ye to pull her hand and walk towards a corner at the right.

Right when Yang Ye and Qin Xiyue had just left a short moment, a curly bearded man appeared not too far from where Yang Ye and Qin Xiyue were standing earlier. The curly bearded man swept the surroundings with his gaze, and a wisp of bewilderment flashed in his eyes when he didn’t notice Yang Ye and Qin Xiyue.

Right at this moment, a middle aged man arrived at the curly bearded man’s side.

The curly bearded man shot a glance at the middle aged man before he grunted coldly, and then his figure flashed before he vanished on the spot.

The middle aged man swept the surroundings with his gaze. Earlier, he’d sensed Yang Ye and Qin Xiyue’s auras, but for some unknown reason, their auras had vanished as soon as he arrived here.

After a short while, the middle aged man’s figure flashed and vanished on the spot as well.

In the shadows at the corner of a wall, Qin Xiyue and Yang Ye were pressed tightly against each other. Both of them held their breaths and listened attentively while a violet light barrier covered both of them. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

After around 15 minutes passed, the violet mink on Yang Ye’s shoulder waved its little claw, and the violet light vanished. The violet mink nodded with its little head at Yang Ye, and Yang Ye it allowed Yang Ye to heave a sigh of relief.

Qin Xiyue asked in a low voice. “They’ve left?”

Yang Ye nodded and said, “Earlier, the little fellow told me that someone’s Divine Sense was scanning towards us. So, I pulled you along with me and left. Fortunately, the little fellow’s violet light is able to isolate us from that Divine Sense. Otherwise, we’d be in huge trouble today!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye stretched out his hand and rubbed the little fellow’s head, and he said, “I have to thank you again this time!”

The violet mink blinked, and then it touched Yang Ye’s face with its little claw as if it was saying he didn’t have to thank it.

A wisp of affection flashed in Qin Xiyue’s eyes when she saw the violet mink was so ‘human’, and she asked. “Little Brother, tell Big Sister honestly. Is it really a beast king or not?”

Yang Ye smiled, and then he looked at the violet mink and said, “Little Fellow, tell her if you’re a beast king or not!”

The violet mink looked at Qin Xiyue, and then it shook its little head.

Qin Xiyue was delighted, and she couldn’t help but stretch out her hands with the intention of embracing the violet mink. However, the violet mink was unwilling to be embraced by her, and it merely flickered once before it appeared on Yang Ye’s shoulder.

“Little Brother, ask it to let me embrace it, and then I’ll let you embrace me. Alright?”

Yang Ye. “....”

The two of them returned once more to the before the imperial palace, but they were much more careful this time and hid right at the back of the crowd. Moreover, they’d changed into a different set of clothes. So, when coupled with the presence of the violet mink to isolate the Divine Sense of others from them, they were temporarily safe.

After around two hours passed, a middle aged man flashed over from afar. When they saw the middle aged man, the originally clamorous atmosphere in the surroundings instantly quieted down. Because there were a pair of wings formed from Profound Energy on the middle aged man’s back, and this was the sign of a Spirit Realm expert!

The middle aged man’s gaze swept slowly through the crowd beneath him before finally stopping on the members of the Origin School. When they saw the middle aged man look over, the members of the Origin School hurriedly bowed to the middle aged man. The middle aged man nodded before he said in a loud voice, “Everyone, I’m an Elder of the Origin School, and my name is Xu Qing. I’m also the person in charge of opening the Tomb of Emperor Zhou this time. The Tomb of Emperor Zhou is opened once a year. Anyone can enter it, and there are countless treasures within it, so everyone will be able to obtain something. This is a fortuitous encounter for all of you. However, if anyone finds top-grade Energy Stones or Emperor Zhou’s Seal, then please hand it over. Of course, we’ll provide corresponding compensation.”

Everyone present here in the surroundings nodded and agreed. Of course, it was unknown whether their agreement was sincere.

“Top-grade Energy Stones? Emperor Zhou’s Seal?” Yang Ye turned around and asked Qin Xiyue. “I know about Energy Stones, but what are top-grade Energy Stones and Emperor Zhou’s Seal?”

Qin Xiyue was accustomed to Yang Ye’s ignorance, and she immediately explained. “Top-grade Energy Stones are countless times better than ordinary Energy Stones. For example, if the Profound Energy within a King Realm expert was completely exhausted, then it would probably take 100 ordinary Energy Stones to replenish. Moreover, it would take around two to four hours to completely absorb. However, if top-grade Energy Stones were utilized, then merely one would be enough, and it would take around half an hour at most.”

“That’s a treasure!” Yang Ye was slightly tempted when he heard this. It’s like the strengthened version of Energy Stones!

He seemed to have thought of something and asked. “Since there are top-grade Energy Stones here, then why don’t the members of the six great powers and the Grand Qin Empire go in there themselves? I’m talking about dispatching extraordinary experts into it like Spirit Realm experts!”

“Because only Profounders at the King Realm or below can enter the Tomb of Emperor Zhou. As for the reason, I presume it’s because of an agreement formed between them or perhaps there are some secrets to the tomb. In any case, I don’t really know the reason, so don’t ask me. Big Sister doesn’t know everything!” Qin Xiyue spoke with slight anger.

Yang Ye was just about to say something. However, right at this moment, the Spirit Realm expert, Xu Qing, withdrew a talisman and tossed it onto the entrance of the imperial palace.

The talisman exploded apart as soon as it flew up into the air. Along with the rumbling of the explosion, the glow of the talisman markings on the walls of the imperial palace immediately dimmed down.

At the same time, countless people cheered before they charged towards the entrance of the imperial palace.
