Chapter 1392 – All On His Own!

The black robed man, the 3 Mu Sanyuans, Jin Xiu, and Lian Suyao’s group were standing before Yang Ye.

9 people!

9 extraordinary geniuses who were comparable to Semi-Deities!

Moreover, more had arrived.

It didn’t take long for 3 middle aged men to appear in the sky above the Radiant Dimension. They weren’t Voiders but Semi-Deities, true Semi-Deities! Moreover, based on their auras, all of them weren’t weak Semi-Deities but true Semi-Deities that had relied on their own hard work to attain their realms of cultivation.

12!

Yang Ye wanted to flee now.

He knew that Nether Maiden and the others had definitely not thrown him into such a situation on purpose. That face down below was probably really important to them, and it was so important that they were willing to sacrifice themselves. If he wasn’t wrong, that face was the reason they’d gathered in the Radiant Dimension and stayed here for so long.

What exactly was the face? He naturally didn’t have the time to think about that right now. He had to consider how he would deal with these 12 people in front of him.

He’d immediately thought of Qiong Qi. Unfortunately, Qiong Qi didn’t reply no matter how he called out to Qiong Qi.

Obviously, he couldn’t place any hopes on Qiong Qi.

Yang Ye remained silent for a moment before he looked up at the black robed man and the others here. At this moment, all of them were looking at him too. Yang Ye pondered deeply for a short moment, and then he said, “I think we can sit down and discuss this. Talking about the problem is the most efficient method. What do all of you think?”

“I think that the fist is the most efficient method to deal with things!” The black robed man spoke indifferently, “Yang Ye, I don’t want to waste my breath on you. Hand over my Soul Beast and I’ll let you die with dignity. Otherwise, death would be what you wish for the most.”

Yang Ye glanced at them and said, “A person will explode with unimaginable strength when pushed into a corner. So, it’s best if you don’t push me into a corner. Otherwise, I’ll fight desperately against all of you.”

“What a joke!” The black robed man ridiculed, “What a huge joke! Yang Ye, you’re still so full of nonsense when you’re about to die? Don’t you think it’s really laughable?”

The black robed man didn’t waste his breath again. He just waved his right hand and said, “His head is worth 10 permits. We can kill him first, and then discuss how to share the permits.”

All of them exchanged glances and nodded. They weren’t fools, so they wouldn’t discuss how to share the permits before they killed Yang Ye.

They didn’t speak another word and just charged at Yang Ye.

The black robed man charged at the front of the group. He knew that his Soul Beast was in Yang Ye’s possession, and he might be able to get it back if he killed Yang Ye!

As they charged at Yang Ye, all 12 of them released their auras in Yang Ye’s direction, causing Yang Ye to feel like his heart had stopped.

A wisp of ferocity flashed through Yang Ye’s eyes as he watched the 12 of them charge at him.

Suddenly, a beam of crystal blue light shot down from the starry sky, and it instantly entered Yang Ye’s body from the top of his head. Once it entered his body, crystal blue scales instantly covered him. At the same time, stellar energy flowed incessantly through him.

The stellar energy within him surged in waves.

Yang Ye’s eyes gradually turned blood red as he gazed at the black robed man and the others. The ancient sheath appeared in his left grasp, and the sword in his right grasp was exchanged for the Sword Precursor.

A terrifying aura surged out from Yang Ye once his sword was sheathed.

Lian Suyao and the others’ expressions changed drastically because they knew that Yang Ye was about to draw his sword. Just thinking about that attack made a chill run down their spines. Right when they were about to turn around and retreat, the black robed man suddenly shouted with fury, “Don’t retreat. He’s almost completely exhausted. I’ll stop this attack of his, so come with me! Kill....”

Om!

A sword howl suddenly interrupted him, and then a beam of sword energy flashed out from Yang Ye’s ancient sheath. It was so swift that it couldn’t even be seen properly.

The black robed man’s pupils had instantly constricted to the size of needles when the sword energy appeared, and then his hairs stood on end.

He was horrified!

At the moment he saw the attack, the black robed man was in a terrible state. He knew that he’d severely underestimated Yang Ye’s attack. As far as he’d been concerned, no matter how strong an Emperor was, how strong could an Emperor be? Could someone like that defy the heavens? So, he hadn’t really taken Yang Ye’s attack seriously.

However, when he saw it, he knew that it could really defy the heavens!

Unfortunately, it was too late!

Hiss!

The black robed man’s figure was split into 2 in midair. Because the sword energy was too swift, it was very abrupt and shocking. Because the others hadn’t been able to catch sight of the sword energy. The most shocking part was that the halves of the black robed man’s body were still charging at Yang Ye.

That was naturally caused by momentum. The black robed man had been too swift, and Yang Ye’s attack was swift too. So, his body continued forward even after he died.

Lian Suyao and the others turned ghastly pale when they saw the black robed man’s figure being slashed into 2. They were horrified to the extreme.

Suddenly, one of the Semi-Deities amongst the 3 who’d just arrived spoke ferociously, “There’s no need to fear him! That sword technique was so powerful, so it’s impossible to execute numerous times. Let’s attack him together! 10 permits are right in front....”

Om!

Another sword howl resounded, and then that Semi-Deities voice stopped abruptly.

His figure stiffened on the spot while his eyes opened wide. His eyes were filled with disbelief. In an instant, Lian Suyao and the others watched as his body split open from the center as well.

Blood and internal organs sprayed throughout the air. It was an absolutely bloody scene.

All of them were stunned on the spot, and their eyes were filled with fear and terror.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye sheathed his sword once more.

Om!

The ancient sheath trembled violently when his sword was sheathed within it, and then a ray of dazzling light erupted from it. At the same time, the space around Yang Ye seemed to be unable to endure the sword howl and shook violently.

Lian Suyao and the others were horrified by this sight. All of them shot backwards and instantly moved around 10km back.

Yang Ye’s gaze descended onto Jin Xiu who was comparatively closer to him. Jin Xiu’s expression changed drastically, and he transformed into a ray of golden light that moved far away. Moreover, he hurriedly withdrew his defensive treasures and formed almost 1,000 golden profound energy barriers around himself.

When he saw Jin Xiu retreat, Yang Ye gazed at the 3 Mu Sanyuans. Their expressions immediately changed, and they hurriedly retreated far away just like Jin Xiu.

Once the 3 Mu Sanyuans retreated, Yang Ye gazed at Lian Suyao. Lian Suyao didn’t retreat and just met Yang Ye’s gaze. Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly, and he placed his right hand on the hilt of his sword. Jin Xiu and the others instantly became extremely vigilant from the sight of this, but Lian Suyao seemed quite calm this time.

Right when Yang Ye was about to draw his sword, Lian Suyao suddenly said, “I don’t want those permits anymore.”

Everyone including Yang Ye was stunned. She doesn’t want it?

Lian Suyao shot a deep and long glance at Yang Ye, and then she didn’t speak another word before vanishing into the sky.

“I don’t want it anymore as well!” The petite woman who rode the wolf took a deep and long glance at Yang Ye as well, and then she turned around and vanished into the sky.

“I don’t want it anymore as well.”

In next to no time, all the others who’d come here with Hua Tianyuan had turned around and left the Radiant Dimension.

They were truly afraid.

Perhaps the permit could change their destiny, but if they lost their lives, then even a thousand permits would be useless. At this point in the battle, every single time they felt that it would be Yang Ye’s last attack or that he was almost exhausted, Yang Ye would give them a great ‘pleasant surprise’.

They truly didn’t want to continue experiencing those ‘pleasant surprises’ anymore.

They couldn’t take it anymore!

So, Lian Suyao and the others had decisively chosen to leave. The permits were good, but their lives were more important!

Once Lian Suyao and the others left, only Jin Xiu, the 3 Mu Sanyuans, and the other 2 Semi-Deities remained here.

There were only 2 choices before them. The 1st was to continue and annihilate Yang Ye, and the 2nd was to do as Lian Suyao and the others had done, it was to decisively decide to leave. Even though they would lose their chance to obtain the permits, their survival would be guaranteed.

However, they were truly unwilling to just leave like that.

But while they refused to leave, they didn’t dare to attack as well.

Suddenly, Yang Ye gazed at Jin Xiu and the others, and their expressions changed slightly while vigilance and fear filled their eyes. Even though Yang Ye was just an Emperor and was a realm of cultivation below them, none of them dared to underestimate him.

Yang Ye looked straight at them and said, “Is it really worth it to use your lives to exhaust me, and then allow those who arrive later to reap the benefits? If you think it’s worth it, then what are you waiting for? Come at me right now!” As he finished speaking, a ferocious expression appeared on Yang Ye’s face while a trace of madness appeared in his eyes.

Jin Xiu gazed at Yang Ye for a long time, and then he said, “I don’t want the permits anymore as well.”

As soon as he finished speaking, his figure vanished into the sky.

Since he didn’t dare to attack, he had no choice but to retreat. Those who dare not attack yet refuse to retreat and constantly act hesitantly will usually suffer horrible fates. So, Jin Xiu had decisively chosen to retreat.

Those who couldn’t resist temptation usually suffered terrible consequences.

Once Jin Xiu left, only the 3 Mu Sanyuans and those 2 Semi-Deities remained.

The 3 Mu Sanyuans exchanged glances and nodded. They were just about to leave when an old man in linen robes suddenly appeared here.

“My alliance should have stopped at nothing to kill you all those years ago. But it isn’t too late now!” As soon as he finished speaking, the old man in linen robes stretched out his hand and tapped a finger in Yang Ye’s direction.

Bang!

Yang Ye was instantly blasted around 10km away!

A Deity!

The 3 Mu Sanyuans and the 2 Semi-Deities who’d been about to leave had immediately stopped when they witnessed this scene.
