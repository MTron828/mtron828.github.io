Chapter 2522 – Everything Will Be Alright!

The Worldborn Fruit Tree’s intelligence was clearly much greater than the Chaotic Fruit Trees!

Because it knew how to curry favor with Yang Ye, and it did so because it understood the reality of things well.

Yang Ye and Snowy were the greatest here!

The Chaotic Fruit Tree would try to curry favor with Snowy, and it would too, but the Chaotic Fruit Tree wouldn’t try to flatter Yang Ye. Because in its instinct, it felt that Yang Ye was of no help to it, but the Worldborn Fruit Tree wouldn’t make that mistake!

It felt that flattering Yang Ye was no different than flattering Snowy!

It was a level of realization the Chaotic Fruit Tree didn’t possess!

The Worldborn Fruit Tree was clearly at a much higher level than the Chaotic Fruit Trees!

Yang Ye placed a pile of World Crystals below the Worldborn Fruit Tree before he left. They still were very useful to it!

After he left the tree, Yang Ye visited Oxxy and the others again, and he left the Primordial Pagoda once he saw that they were doing fine.

Outside the Primordial Pagoda, Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings and vanished on the spot.

Yang Ye shot through the clouds on his sword, and a ray of light flashed through the sky, leaving behind an extremely striking trail!

Yang Ye had his eyes closed on the sword as he sensed the airflow around him, and his thoughts drifted!

Since he started on Profounder Continent, he’d experienced too, too many things. However, he still felt that he knew too, too little about this universe!

The old man with the bamboo chest, the Desolate Emperor, Chen Xuanan, destiny, Four-Dimensional Space… All of these things exceeded the current scope of his knowledge!

He was within the universe yet was bewildered by it!

There was one more question that he had, how far did he have to cultivate before he was finally at the end?

Or perhaps there really was no end?

He wondered where Tian Xiu was too! And he wondered where the girls from the Nether Pavilion were!

A long time passed before Yang Ye took a deep breath and grinned, “Everything will be alright!”

He sped up once he finished speaking.

Two hours later, Yang Ye arrived at the Ancient Sword Sect!

As soon as he arrived, an old man appeared before him, the Inner Court Elder, Elder Xu!

Yang Ye bowed slightly to Elder Xu and didn’t say anything.

Elder Xu sized up Yang Ye and said, “I heard about some things that happened in the War Dimension. You helped Lu Yunxian and the others!”

Yang Ye smiled, “We’re from the same sect, so I should do that!”

Elder Xu nodded slightly, “It’s good that you think that way. Now, you’re an elite disciple, so go report to the Grand Elder!”

Yang Ye bowed slightly to Elder Xu and left.

Elder Xu glanced at Yang Ye with quite a complicated expression on his face. If such an expert could really acknowledge the sect, it would be an extremely good thing for the sect!

However, his intuition told him that this young man’s aspirations were not in the Ancient Sword Sect!

…

Yang Ye asked around and arrived before a palace. He was stopped at the entrance!

It was a young sword cultivator in a green robe who stopped him. The young man sized up Yang Ye and asked, “State your name and business!”

Yang Ye cupped his fist, “I’m Ye Yang. I’m here to see the Grand Elder. Please notify him of my arrival!”

“Ye Yang!” The young man spoke with surprise, “You’re Ye Yang?”

Yang Ye was surprised, “You know me?”

The young man sized up Yang Ye and nodded slightly, “I heard about some of your deeds in the War Dimension. Right, wait a moment. The Grand Elder is in closed door cultivation. I’ll go report your arrival!”

Yang Ye replied, “Thanks!”

The young man nodded slightly, and then he turned around and left.

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings and said, “Sword Scroll, can you sense your main body?”

A moment of silence ensued, and then Sword Scroll said, “I can sense it faintly. However, it isn’t clear. I presume it’s being isolated.”

Yang Ye nodded slightly and looked up at the palace before him. His goal was Sword Scroll’s main body, and he would leave once he obtained it.

He hoped everything would go smoothly!

He really didn’t want to be hunted down throughout the world!

Not long passed before the young man appeared before Yang Ye once more, and he gestured for Yang Ye to enter!

Yang Ye nodded slightly and walked in. The hall within was quite spacious, and there were no chairs. Moreover, it was quite dim, so it felt quite oppressive.

It didn’t take long for an old man to appear before Yang Ye. It was the Grand Elder whom he’d met at the Ye Clan that day!

Yang Ye bowed slightly to the Grand Elder, “Grand Elder!”

The Grand Elder sized up Yang Ye and asked, “Why have you returned now?”

Yang Ye said, “War City has been taken, and the human cultivators are fleeing. I think staying won’t change anything, so I returned to study the Sword Dao!”

The Grand Elder shook his head slightly, “You just think there’s nothing to temper yourself with over there, right?”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

The Grand Elder flicked a golden piece of paper to Yang Ye, and on it were records of some of his deeds in the War Dimension, including him killing a Five World Realm expert!

Of course, it didn’t contain what had happened within the Myriad World Diagram!

Yang Ye fell silent.

The Grand Elder said, “You’re a sword cultivator, and we’ve never heard of you! My Ancient Sword Sect investigated your origins, but we failed to find out anything. Or I should say that we only know you’re an illegitimate child of the Ye Clan, and the Ye Clan seems to have admitted that. However, as far we are concerned, there are many suspicious parts about all of this.”

Yang Ye gazed at the Grand Elder, “Then who do you think I am?”

The Grand Elder looked Yang Ye in the eyes, “That’s what I would like to know too!”𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Yang Ye smiled, “I’m just an illegitimate child of the Ye Clan, that is my identity.”

The Grand Elder gazed at him in silence.

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings and said, “Grand Elder, there are at least 3 Five World Realm experts, 2 Lord Realm experts, and maybe even stronger experts. All of them are hiding in the shadows. Come, let me guess, they are here to act against me?”

The Grand Elder waved his right hand, and those experts immediately vanished.

After he made them leave, the Grand Elder gazed at Yang Ye with a rather complicated expression on his face, “Kid, you’re an independent cultivator, and it isn’t talent that brought you here, it’s your will and heart toward the sword. That’s why we think highly of you because talent is really not as precious as strong willpower. However, the Ancient Sword Sect has been passed down for generations, so we are afraid of bringing an enemy into our midst.”

Yang Ye smiled, “I can leave if the Ancient Sword Sect doesn’t trust me.”

The Grand Elder’s eyes narrowed slightly when he heard this, and Yang Ye just walked away!

At this moment, he absolutely couldn’t act like he wanted to stay. The more he wanted to stay, the more they would think that there was something wrong with him. Conversely, if he tried to leave, there would be a greater chance that they asked him to stay!

Sure enough, the Grand Elder spoke abruptly when he arrived at the door, “You’re an elite disciple of my Ancient Sword Sect now.”

Yang Ye gazed at the Grand Elder, and the latter smiled, “The heart is clear in time!”

He flicked a command token to Yang Ye.

There was a small ‘真’ character inscribed on it.

It was the command token of an elite disciple!

Yang Ye put the command token away. Meanwhile, the Grand Elder added, “You can visit three places in the sect. The Sword Pavilion has many Divine Treasures, and you can try your luck there. You cannot choose them there, and only they can choose you. If any Divine Treasure is willing to leave with you, then it’s your fortune! Besides that, you can freely enter the various cultivation grounds in the sect. They had the purest spirit energy that will be extremely beneficial to your cultivation! And finally, there’s the Sword Cave!”

Yang Ye intentionally asked, “The Sword Cave?”

The Grand Elder glanced at him and explained, “It’s a Secret Realm in the sect, and the seniors of our sect have all gone there to rest. After they entered eternal slumber, they left their own legacy behind. Of course, their treasures are there too. Our sect never tries to take them by force! All of it depends on luck! Any elite disciple or those who have rendered great contribution to the sect can try their luck there. You too can try your luck!”

Yang Ye nodded, “Alright, I’ll try if I have the time!”

The Grand Elder continued, “There are usually no restrictions in our sect, but once the sect issued an emergency summons, then you must rush over no matter where you are. Otherwise, you’ll be severely punished. Don’t forget that!”

He turned around and left.

Yang Ye glanced at the command token in his grasp and left.

Sword Scroll suddenly said, “Go to the Sword Pavilion first!”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Why?”

She replied indifferently, “It would be quite strange for you to immediately head to the Sword Cave, and it’s very likely to arouse their suspicion!”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and nodded, and then he walked in the Sword Pavilion’s direction.

Once Yang Ye left, the Grand Elder appeared at the entrance to the palace, and he watched Yang Ye leave in silence.

Suddenly, a white-haired beautiful woman appeared beside him!

The woman seemed to be around the age of 30. Her snow-white hair didn’t make her seem even older because her snow-white skin was without the slightest wrinkles. Conversely, her snow-white hair made her seem quite enchanting.

The beautiful woman suddenly asked, “Are you still worried?”

The Grand Elder nodded, “While the Ye Clan has acknowledged him, his origins, talent, and strength are truly unusual! Moreover, he definitely has had his own fortuitous encounters along his path of cultivation, so I don’t believe that he joined our sect for sword techniques!”

The beautiful woman shook her head, “You’re thinking too much about it!”

The woman said, “He has a pure heart. Even if he has his own goals, he isn’t someone who would stop at nothing to achieve his goal. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have been able to get where he is. Our sect just has to treat him well, as for how he treats our sect in the future, that is his business. But we cannot be the first to act maliciously.”

The Grand Elder fell silent for a long time, and then he nodded slightly, “I understand.”

He gazed at her and continued, “I didn’t expect you to come personally!”

She looked up into the distance and said, “He isn’t ordinary!”
