Chapter 2114 – I Want to Kill a Few People!

Once the armless man left, the surroundings fell silent.

The Weapon Progenitor sat there, and no one knew what he was thinking.

A short while later, Han Xian walked over and said, “Ancestor, was that the dean of Martial Emperor Academy?”

The Weapon Progenitor nodded slightly, “The academy was founded by the Martial Emperor, but no one knows why he vanished all those years ago. However, someone else took the position of dean.”

“The Martial Emperor vanished?” Han Xian asked, “Who can possibly make a Progenitor Realm expert vanish without leaving any trace behind?”

The Weapon Progenitor said, “All four paths investigated it, but we returned empty handed. Now, it seems like the Martial Emperor is still alive. As for that armless man…”

The Weapon Progenitor frowned.

Han Xian asked, “Who is he?”

The Weapon Progenitor shook his head slightly, “Once Martial Emperor Academy got a new dean, while all four paths didn’t pay him a visit, he remained quite mysterious, and he never showed himself in public. Now, he showed himself for Yang Ye… Yang Ye…”

Han Xian suddenly asked, “Ancestor, are you unable to kill him too?”

The Weapon Progenitor gazed at Han Xian and said, “We are not invincible. If Progenitor Realm experts are invincible, the experts of the prehistoric civilization and the god race wouldn’t have vanished or fallen into decline.”

Han Xian lowered his head and remained silent.

The Weapon Progenitor stood up, “More and more things are coming into the light. Summon Zhong Ye back. My Weapon Path needs the leadership of someone who dares to fight.”

Han Xian lowered his head further when he heard this, and no one knew what he was thinking.

The Weapon Progenitor added, “No matter what enmity we have internally, it ends now. Understand?”

Han Xian nodded slightly, “I understand.”

The old man glanced at Han Xian and closed his eyes slowly.

The surroundings fell silent once more.

…

The main peak of the Slaughter Line.

Yang Ye was still cultivating within the Primordial Pagoda.

Meanwhile, Elder Mo shot a glance up into the sky while he stood outside the hall, and then he shot a glance in Yang Ye’s direction and left.

Time trickled by. Six months passed in the blink of an eye within the Primordial Pagoda.

During this time, Snowy and Tian Xiu frequently came to the cultivation room and took glances at Yang Ye, and they puckered their lips and left with disappointment every time they saw that he wasn’t awake. The two little fellows went to take a look three times a day. Once in the morning, once at noon, and once at night. There were many times that Snowy was almost unable to stop herself from going over to Yang Ye’s shoulder and pinching Yang Ye’s lips. She clearly wanted to say—Just stop cultivating and come play with me!

Tian Xiu was a little more sensible and would drag Snowy away.

Time trickled by, another six months passed. One morning, Snowy and Tian Xiu were here again. Snowy hopped over to Yang Ye and gazed carefully at his eyes. She blinked when she saw that he didn’t open them, and then she shook her head and intended to leave. However, Yang Ye’s eyes suddenly opened.

Snowy’s eyes opened wide when she noticed this.

There was a little trace of confusion and age in his eyes.

Suddenly, Snowy scratched Yang Ye’s face with her claws, and his eyes instantly returned to normal.

Yang Ye glanced at Snowy and smiled, “Snowy, long time no see!”

Snowy cracked a smile and rubbed her head against his chin.

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings, shook his head, and smiled. He’d experienced so much this time. In the beginning, he was merely comprehending what he’d already gained insight into, but as it went on, his comprehension grew deeper, and he comprehended more and more. It was to the extent that this comprehension went on for a year!

Of course, he’d gained a lot too. Firstly, he’d advanced from the Minor Zen Realm to the Major Zen Realm!

This advancement allowed his overall strength to increase tremendously. The gap between the Major Zen Realm and the Sage Realm was just a single step. While this step may seem like the distance between the heavens and the earth to others, it was merely just a step to Yang Ye. Presently, he didn’t fear Sages at all. Or it should be said that he was very confident in his ability to defeat a Sage, unlike before.

Besides the rise in his cultivation, he’d improved himself as well!

The Sword Dao!

He’d actually been comprehending his own Sword Dao earlier. In short, he was thinking about his Sword Dao, thinking about its flaws and the strong points of others. He was thinking about all possibilities!

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts and took both Snowy and Tian Xiu with him as he went to the 1st level of the pagoda.

Yang Ye moved his hand slightly and a sword appeared in his grasp.

Judgment!

He gazed at it for a short while, and then he issued a command in his heart and put judgment away. At the same time, he closed his eyes. A long time passed before he suddenly chuckled. Throughout these years, his Sword Dao had gone from being simple at first to becoming complicated, and then it returned to simplicity again. Process after process that allowed his Sword Dao to advance a level higher. This time, his Sword Dao had transformed from simple to complicated again!

Before this, his sword was a sword, just a sword. Yet now, he felt that a sword wasn’t just a sword.

Why were Sages powerful?

They were able to use the energy of the heavens and the earth. They could use the energy of all things. As for experts below the Sage Realm, they could only rely on such things, but Sages weren’t just relying on them, they were truly taking control of them.

As for Yang Ye, he chose to rely!

Judgment appeared in Yang Ye’s grasp again, and then it floated before him. In an instant, it started shaking violently while countless strands of energy instantly converged into Judgment.

These energies included the five elements, the spirit energy of the world, spatial energy, and all the other forms of energy that Yang Ye possessed.

Yang Ye’s goal was very simple. It was to merge everything he’d learned into the tip of his sword.

He planned to merge them forcefully!

Simply speaking, he planned to completely merge every single source of strength he could draw upon into the tip of his sword, and that was the ‘complicated’ he sought.

However, a process still had to be completed.

Moreover, while it sounded simple, it was quite difficult to put into action.

Snowy and Tian Xiu stood far away from Yang Ye.

Time trickled by, and the sword before Yang Ye was trembling more and more violently.

Suddenly, Yang Ye tapped its tip.

A sword howl resounded, and then Judgment transformed into a ray of light that vanished into the sky.

Fine!

The ray of light was so fine that Yang Ye could only see a dot the size of a needle.

It wasn’t just fine, it was strong too!

That speck of light contained extremely terrifying energy.

When it vanished into the sky, the entire world had turned ethereal.

Truly ethereal!

It represented that even the world around him wasn’t really able to endure its strength.

However, Yang Ye shook his head, “That isn’t enough!” Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

As soon as he finished speaking, he closed his eyes slowly. While it carried extremely terrifying strength, it hadn’t achieved his expectations. As far as he was concerned, it should be able to be stronger. After all, he’d learned so much throughout his life. Especially his physical strength, it wasn’t inferior to his Sword Dao at all. Yet now, he’d even merged his physical strength into his Sword Dao. So, his body had truly become an auxiliary form of support for his Sword Dao!

So, as far as he was concerned, it should be stronger.

It could be stronger!

Yang Ye issued a command in his heart and Judgment appeared before him again.

Yang Ye took a deep breath and slowly clenched his fists. In an instant, Judgment started trembling again. Suddenly, a small golden pagoda appeared before Yang Ye, and then a ray of terrifying golden light slammed Yang Ye over 3km away.

Yang Ye was stunned speechless.

Meanwhile, the pagoda wanted to attack again, but Snowy suddenly went over to it and hugged it tight.

Yang Ye had quite an embarrassed expression on his face as he gazed at the angry little pagoda before him. He’d forgotten that he was within the Primordial Pagoda, so he couldn’t act rashly. The might of that last attack had harmed the world in here a little.

In the end, Snowy was able to dissuade the Primordial Pagoda from pursuing the matter. However, it flew over to Yang Ye and floated above his head. Obviously, it was warning him.

Snowy went over to Yang Ye and shrugged.

Yang Ye shook his head and smiled, and then he rubbed Snowy’s head and said, “Thanks!”

If it wasn’t for Snowy, he wouldn’t have just been warned, he would have been beaten.

Snowy cracked a smile, flew over to Yang Ye’s shoulder, and then rubbed her head against his cheek.

After that, Yang Ye didn’t leave the Primordial Pagoda. He went to play with Snowy and Tian Xiu instead. After all, they’d been waiting an entire year to play with him!

Two days later, Yang Ye left the Primordial Pagoda.

As soon as he left the hall, he met Elder Mo.

Yang Ye asked, “Has the Weapon Path taken any action?” He hadn’t concealed the fact that he’d stayed in the Weapon Dimension, so the Weapon Path knew that he was in the main peak of the Slaughter Line.

Elder Mo shook his head slightly, “No.”

Yang Ye nodded and said, “Elder Mo, I don’t know when we’ll be able to meet next. No matter who you are, thank you for taking care of me and helping me. Farewell!”

Yang Ye cupped his fist to Elder Mo and walked away.

Suddenly, Elder Mo asked, “Which path are you visiting next?”

Yang Ye smiled, “The Buddhist Path. I’ve wanted to go there for a long time!”

Elder Mo said, “They probably won’t let you leave!”

Yang Ye smiled, “The Buddhist Path is benevolent. They won’t make things difficult for me!”

Elder Mo said, “I’m afraid that won’t happen!”

Yang Ye nodded slightly, “That’s fine. I just happened to have achieved a breakthrough, so I feel like killing some people for training!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye vanished into the sky.
