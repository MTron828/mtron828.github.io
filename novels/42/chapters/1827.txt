Chapter 1828 – Blood Rebirth!

“Senior Brother?” Yang Ye was stunned for quite a while before he asked, “He’s a disciple of the old man in Daoist’s robes? That’s not right! It was the old man in Daoist’s robes who imprisoned him!”

Qiong Qi replied, “Kid, who said anything about him being your master’s disciple? Kid, your master has other senior brothers and junior brothers!”

Senior and junior brothers! Yang Ye asked, “He’s one of their disciples?”

Qiong Qi said, “It’s very likely. Because we sensed the aura of a Daoist from him. The reason we concealed ourselves was because we were afraid he would sense us. That’s probably the exact same reason why the pagoda fell deathly silent too. If we join forces, we naturally wouldn’t have to fear him. But what if he sends news of our presence to the large universe. At that time, you’ll be in big trouble!”

I see! Yang Ye nodded slightly and said, “So, my master isn’t on good terms with my martial uncles?”

“How would I know?” Qiong Qi continued, “They seem to get along very well, but how should I say it… There’s a difference in paths between them. In any case, it may become a huge problem for the large universe. In short, you have to grow stronger as soon as possible! Otherwise, once you’re swept into that dispute, even your master may not be able to save you!”

Yang Ye looked up at Heaven Pillar Mountain. The mountain towered into the clouds, and the passageway to the large universe was up there!

The large universe was where the true cultivators and ancient cultivators resided, and it was a place filled with all sorts of experts!

Not to mention facing those people up there, his current strength wasn’t even sufficient to face the middle aged man from before or the woman in a red dress!

“He had the desire to kill you just now!” Qiong Qi suddenly said, “He definitely thought of killing you. However, he abandoned that thought for some reason.”

Yang Ye nodded slightly, “I sensed it.”

Even though the middle aged man had been speaking to him in such an amicable manner and even gave him the tree, the middle aged man had aroused the desire to kill him. But just like Qiong Qi said, he didn’t know why the middle aged man had abandoned that thought!

Meanwhile, Qiong Qi added, “No matter what, you have to be careful in this place! This place is connected to the large universe. So, besides those ancient cultivators, there are people and beings from the large universe. They are all true old freaks. Even though you’re very strong right now, it depends on who you’re being compared to. You’re far inferior if you’re being compared to those old freaks!”

Yang Ye nodded. The incident just now had allowed him to gain a completely new understanding of his own strength.

He was very strong, but he was only strong to some people, like an ordinary 6th stage True Realm expert. He really was strong when compared to experts like that because he could kill some of them in an instant. However, if he was compared to those old monsters like the middle aged man from before, then he was still very weak!

Strength!

He had to improve his strength!

Yang Ye took a deep breath and said, “Brother Qiong Qi, can that fruit really help me attain the 2nd level of the Undying Hegemon technique?”

“Yes!” It was Hou Qing who answered him, “That thing isn’t just able to help you attain the 2nd level, it’ll transform your body into a state that is much stronger than Blood Rebirth. Even in my shaman race, only the direct descendants of the Shaman King are able to possess that fruit!”

Yang Ye said, “I want to use it now. That tree and the Soul Nurturing Flower too!”

Hou Qing explained, “You can use the Fruit of Rebirth because your body is extremely strong, and you’ll be able to endure its energy. However, you can’t use the Spirit Shaping Tree and Soul Nurturing Flower right now. Your spiritual energy and soul aren’t able to endure their energy. If you forcefully utilize them, you’ll suffer backlash and die!”

“That fellow isn’t wrong!” Qiong Qi added, “You’ll barely be able to utilize them upon attaining the 5th stage of the True Realm. Kid, I know you want to improve your strength, but you really can’t rush it. Haste isn’t always a good thing. I’m sure you understand that!”

Yang Ye nodded, “I was being impatient. So, I’ll use the Fruit of Rebirth first! There are 12 of them on the tree. Should I consume all of them?”

“Then you’ll explode and die on the spot!” Meanwhile, Hou Qing spoke abruptly, “Kid, the energy within the Fruit of Rebirth is absolutely beyond your imagination. Moreover, advancing to the 2nd level of the Undying Hegemon technique doesn’t require that many Fruits of Rebirth. Three, just three are enough. You can keep the rest. When you want to advance to the 3rd level of the technique, you can try exchanging them with the shaman race for the treasures you need!”

Yang Ye replied, “Alright!”

He glanced at the surroundings and was about to enter the Primordial Pagoda when he suddenly gazed at Snowy who was on his shoulder. Snowy seemed quite depressed.

Yang Ye rubbed her head, “What’s wrong?”

Snowy looked up at him and started to wave her claws. As she did that, her eyes started to become moist, and it seemed like she would cry at any moment.

It didn’t take long for Yang Ye to understand what she meant.

Snowy was feeling guilty. Because she asked Yang Ye to go there, and Yang Ye had encountered danger because of that.

Yang Ye grinned and rubbed her head, “It has nothing to do with you. See, didn’t we get the treasure?”

Treasures!

The moistness of her eyes vanished in an instant, and then she waved her claw. A Fruit of Rebirth appeared in her grasp, and then she pointed at it before pointing at herself. It was like she was asking if she could have it!

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and was about to speak when Little Sky’s voice resounded in his mind, “Don’t worry. While the energy within it is powerful, it won’t be able to harm her. Or it should be said that so long as it's energy, it can’t harm her.”

Once he heard that, Yang Ye didn’t hesitate to rub her head and said, “Go on.”

Snowy cracked a smile and bit it. A moment later, her eyes opened wide, and then she suddenly spat out the piece she bit. After that, she tossed it into Yang Ye’s arms and flashed into the Primordial Pagoda!

Yang Ye was stunned speechless.

A short while passed before he looked at the fruit. He hesitated for a moment before taking a bite as well. Yang Ye’s eyes opened wide as soon as it entered his mouth, and then he did just as Snowy did. He spat it out!

It was bitter!

Absolutely bitter!

Yang Ye had never had something so bitter in his life. So, it was no wonder that Snowy didn’t like it! Not to mention Snowy, even he didn’t want to eat it!

Suddenly, Qiong Qi’s voice resounded in his mind, “Kid, get in here. This little fellow is going crazy!”

Yang Ye was stunned and went into the Primordial Pagoda. His face darkened when he saw Snowy.

At this moment, Snowy was chasing after the Spirit Shaping Tree with the wooden sword.

The Spirit Shaping Tree had a consciousness of its own, so it would fight back when in danger. However, it clearly didn’t dare to fight back against Snowy. Moreover, it didn’t have any offensive abilities, so it had no choice but to run!

Qiong Qi and Hou Qing were watching from the side.

They naturally wanted to stop her, but they didn’t dare to! Snowy was an existence that couldn’t be offended in the Primordial Pagoda. As for Zi’er, she was comparatively better. Besides cultivating all day, she practically never acted mischievously, and she was quite sensible too!

But Snowy wasn’t sensible at all!

If they stopped her now, she may suddenly appear before them one day and ask to ‘train with the sword’.

Snowy wasn’t strong but getting hit by that wooden sword really hurt! Moreover, everyone knew that Snowy had the Primordial Pagoda’s support! So, only Zi’er, Little Sky, and Yang Ye could stop Snowy in the Primordial Pagoda! Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Yang Ye appeared before Snowy and stopped her. She blinked when she saw Yang Ye, and then she passed the wooden sword to him. After that, she pointed at the Spirit Shaping Tree and seemed like she was telling him to chop it down!

Yang Ye’s face darkened completely. He took the wooden sword and asked, “Why are you trying to chop it up?”

Snowy pointed at the tree, pointed at her mouth, and seemed like she was saying it was because it tasted horrible!

Qiong Qi and Hou Qing exchanged glances when they witnessed this. In the end, Hou Qing shook his head, “It didn’t ask her to eat it. She ate it, thinks it isn’t tasty, and wants to chop that tree into bits…. She’s more overbearing than my Shaman King!”

Meanwhile, Snowy suddenly gazed at Hou Qing. The latter’s face stiffened, and then he hurriedly spoke seriously, “Chop it! Chop it up with everything you face! I support you!”

Snowy cracked a smile when she heard this.

Qiong Qi glanced at Hou Qing, and then he shook his head, “I look down on you now!”

Hou Qing was at a loss for words.

Yang Ye tapped Snowy’s head, “You want to chop it up because it isn’t tasty?”

Snowy blinked and seemed to be asking if there was a problem with that decision.

Yang Ye rubbed her head, “You can’t do that. Understand?”

Snowy blinked and seemed to be asking why.

Yang Ye's head started to hurt. However, he still started to explain. Snowy was kind and na?ve, so she had no idea of right and wrong, and he’d never taught her all of that. That was why she had such bad habits now.

Yang Ye hadn’t realized this problem before this. Yet now, he had. So, he’d decided to teach her properly. Not just now, even in the future. Otherwise, she would really start running wild!

Around 15 minutes later, Snowy suddenly gazed at the Spirit Shaping Tree, and then she waved her claw lightly while smiling at it.

She was apologizing!

It was her way of apologizing!

The Spirit Shaping Tree was clearly quite afraid of Snowy.

Meanwhile, Snowy waved her claw, and a strand of extremely pure spirit energy enveloped the Spirit Shaping Tree. The tree started to tremble lightly…. A short while later, it started to move towards Snowy!

It had been bribed!

Snowy turned to look at Yang Ye, cracked a smile, and seemed to be saying that it was resolved!

Yang Ye shook his head and smiled. He paid no further attention to Snowy and the tree, and he just brought three Fruits of Rebirth to the cultivation room in the Primordial Pagoda.

Yang Ye gazed at the fruits, took a deep breath, and ate one of them.

Blood Rebirth!
