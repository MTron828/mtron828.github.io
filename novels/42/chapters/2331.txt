Chapter 2332 – Hopeless Situation!

Three strikes!

As soon as the third strike descended, the world exploded.

Boom!

The ground collapsed, and the sky and the lightning were obliterated.

The powerful sword energy obliterated everything!

The old man was blasted over 10km away!

As soon as he stopped himself, he frowned. His entire body was covered in marks from the sword. Moreover, if one looked carefully, one would notice that his body was slightly ethereal!

The old man took a deep and long glance at Yang Ye, and then he vanished into the sky.

Everywhere he passed, a long trail of blood remained.

Heavily injured!

Not only had it destroyed the old man’s powerful technique, it had heavily injured the old man too.

Of course, Yang Ye’s injuries were worse!

As soon as he swung that third swing, his body hadn’t been able to endure it and collapsed. Moreover, the severe backlash from it caused his soul to collapse too!

Just two swings had practically been his limit!

But just now, he’d used all his strength to swing a third overlapped strike!

The third overlapped strike caused a qualitative change in his Sword Domain, but it had surpassed the limits that he could endure.

So, it had injured his enemy, but he suffered worse!

At the instant the old man left, Yang Ye crashed down to the ground. Snowy was shocked and quickly ran over, and then she immediately started crying when she saw Yang Ye’s current state.

Sword Scroll walked over to Yang Ye, and she couldn’t help but frown when she noticed that Yang Ye’s body had cracked open tremendously.

Horrible!

Yang Ye’s current state couldn’t even be described with the word horrible.

It wasn’t just his outward appearance, there wasn’t a corner of his internal organs that wasn’t damaged. Especially his heart. If the Primordial Pagoda hadn’t forcefully protected it, his heart would have collapsed by now.

Sword Scroll took a deep breath, and then she gently lifted him up and went off to the ground. Snowy hurriedly followed after her.

Meanwhile, the Sword Gourd suddenly flew over to her, and Snowy was instantly infuriated by the sight of it.

Snowy grabbed the Sword Gourd and tossed it into the sky, and then she gazed at Oxxy before pointing angrily at the Sword Gourd.

She was telling Oxxy to beat it up if it dared to come over to her!

Oxxy unconsciously nodded.

Once she saw Oxxy nod, Snowy turned around and went after Yang Ye.

She didn’t want it anymore!

Yang Ye didn’t want it, so she didn’t want it either. That was what Snowy meant!

Oxxy glanced at Snowy, and then it gazed at Wang Erya. Presently, it trusted two people. One of them was Snowy, and the other was Wang Erya. As for Yang Ye, it didn’t really trust Yang Ye. After all, Yang Ye had almost killed it when he was mad.

Wang Erya glanced at the Sword Gourd in the distance, and then she said, “Isn’t it just allowing Madman Yang to use you. Did you have to be so unwilling? Great, now she doesn’t want you anymore. You’re free!”

Meanwhile, a sword howl resounded from the Sword Gourd, and then a ray of sword energy shot at Wang Erya.

Wang Erya was furious when she saw this, “If she doesn’t want you, what does that have to do with me? How dare you attack me?! Oxxy, kill it!”

She charged at the Sword Gourd once she finished speaking.

Oxxy hurriedly charged after her.

Just like that, Wang Erya and Oxxy kept punching the Sword Gourd all over the place. It was a divine treasure, but if it had no one to use it, then it was no match for them on its own. They possessed real strength after all!

…

The Sword Ruins.

In a stone hall, Yang Ye laid on a stone bed, and Su Qingshi, Zhuang Weiran, and the others were by his side. At this moment, all of them were looking at him.

They had horribly gloomy expressions on their faces as they looked at him.

Yang Ye’s injuries were truly too heavy. If he didn’t have the Primordial Pagoda and Primordial Violet Energy, he would have definitely died by now. Even then, Yang Ye was in a very, very dangerous state. The backlash from that attack hadn’t just destroyed his body, it had cracked open his internal organs, meridians, bones, and everything else.

Any other person would have been dead by now!

“I have bad news for all of you!” Meanwhile, a voice resounded in the hall.

They looked over and saw a woman in a linen dress. It was Jian You.

Jian You spoke indifferently, “The Immortal Estate has sent more experts. Obviously, they don’t want to give him any time to recover!”

Su Qingshi frowned slightly, “Why is the Immortal Estate much stronger than the other clans?”

“You’re wrong!” Meanwhile, Jian You shook her head, “Don’t underestimate the six clans. They came here from other places, so how can they be ordinary? However, their resources and reserves can’t compete with the Immortal Estate, nor can their ability to foster experts compare with the Immortal Estate. But even the Immortal Estate doesn’t dare to rashly act against them. Are any ancestors of the six clans ordinary experts? When they just arrived in this place, even an existence as strong as the Immortal Estate hadn’t been able to kill them! Especially the Initial Emperor of the Shiyuan Clan. He once attacked the Immortal Estate on his own.”

Su Qingshi asked, “Why didn’t they show themselves?”

Jian You replied, “They haven’t done so now, but it doesn’t mean that they won’t. So, he has a lot more trouble to deal with in the future!”

Su Qingshi glanced at Jian You and said, “Are the experts from the Immortal Estate here?”

“They should be here soon!” Jian You continued, “They know that Yang Ye is definitely heavily injured right now, so they won’t give him any chances.”

Su Qingshi fell silent for a long time and said, “Please lend us a hand.” Jian You was the only one who could help them now.

Jian You closed her eyes slowly, “The Sword Ruins has enough trouble.”

Su Qingshi nodded slightly, “I understand.”

She gazed at Yang Ye and said, “Weiran, Yuxi, make preparations. We’re leaving with him.”

Zhuang Weiran glanced at Yang Ye, “Where will we go?”

Su Qingshi fell silent.

Where could they go?

“White Emperor City!” Meanwhile, Bai Zhixian suddenly stepped forward.

They gazed at her, and she spoke solemnly, “While my White Emperor City can’t compare in strength with our prime now, we still have some resources and reserves. My father is a True World Realm expert too. Or to be more precise, he’s halfway into the realm above the True World Realm. Moreover, we have a trump card that our ancestor left behind. I think it shouldn’t be a problem for us to keep the Immortal Estate at bay!”

Su Qingshi spoke softly, “Have you thought about how we’ll bring the war to White Emperor City if he goes there?”

Bai Zhixian looked Su Qingshi in the eyes and said, “Where else can all of you go? He’ll die no matter where he goes in his current state, right?”

Su Qingshi gazed at Bai Zhixian for a long time and said, “Weiran, Yuxi, the two of you are the strongest. So, you protect him. The rest of us will enter the Primordial Pagoda. As for Bai… Zhixian. Zhixian, you stay with Weiran and Yuxi.”

Zhixian!

All of them glanced at Bai Zhixian when they heard Su Qingshi speak those words. Since she’d address Bai Zhixian in that manner, it was obvious that she’d acknowledged her.

Bai Zhixian glanced at Su Qingshi and nodded, “Let’s leave now and strive to get there before the experts of the Immortal Estate arrive!”

It didn’t take long for everyone besides Su Qingshi, Zhuang Weiran, Xiao Yuxi, and Bai Zhixian to enter the Primordial Pagoda. Zhuang Weiran lifted Yang Ye off the bed, and then she vanished from the stone hall with Xiao Yuxi and Bai Zhixian.

Snowy didn’t enter the Primordial Pagoda. She just laid there in Yang Ye’s arms. Su Qingshi and the others didn’t force the sad little fellow to enter the Primordial Pagoda either.

In the stone hall, Su Qingshi walked over to Jian You, and then she bowed slightly, “Thank you for taking care of us throughout this time. My husband, Yang Ye, and I will never forget this. If you need anything in the future, we will definitely not refuse.”

She turned around and walked away.

Once Su Qingshi left, Sword Scroll appeared before Jian You, “Why?”

Jian You spoke softly, “Snowy has endless possibilities in the future, and she can change the fate of my clan. However, do you think a future exists? If I allow them to stay, the Sword Ruins will probably cease to exist. You should be very well aware of what this place represents to my Jian Clan.”

Sword Scroll sighed softly, “True. You don’t owe him anything, and you’ve done enough for him. No matter what, take care!”

Sword Scroll walked out of the hall.

Jian You suddenly asked, “You’re still going to go with them?”

Sword Scroll shook her head and smiled, “Since I chose him, I’ll see my bet through. If I win, I get everything; if I lose, I’ll just die.”

She vanished from the hall once she finished speaking.

In the sky above the Sword Ruins, Wang Erya and Oxxy were still chasing after the Sword Gourd and beating it up.

Bai Zhixian glanced at them and said, “Erya, Oxxy, we’re leaving!”

They immediately abandoned the Sword Gourd when they heard her and shot after Yang Ye and Bai Zhixian. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Bai Zhixian felt a little more confident as she gazed at Wang Erya and Oxxy.

Wang Erya pointed at Yang Ye who was lying in Zhuang Weiran’s arms and asked, “Is he alright?”

Bai Zhixian shook her head, “We must get to White Emperor City. At that time, we may need your help. It’s very dangerous this time, extremely dangerous even. Erya, Oxxy, while I really hope that you’ll help, I won’t blame you if you choose to leave now.”

Wang Erya asked, “Is it very dangerous?”

Bai Zhixian nodded, “Extremely dangerous. All of us might die!”

Wang Erya suddenly jumped with joy and excitement, “I love danger! Moreover, my grandfather told me to stay with you and Madman Yang. I promised him I would, so I won’t leave the two of you!”

She gazed at Oxxy and continued, “Stupid ox, what about you?”

Oxxy pointed at Snowy. Obviously, it was saying that it would follow Snowy!

Bai Zhixian took a deep breath and said, “Alright, then let’s go!”

As soon as she said that, they shot off into the sky.

Their destination, White Emperor City!
