Chapter 1914 – Sage Aura! Spiritbreaker!

Kill! Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

The person Yang Ye wanted to kill was Baili Xian, of course.

In the beginning, he’d made Snowy reveal the secrets in the hall and allowed everyone to enter the true area of the Sage Ruins. He didn’t mind all of that. Yet now, when he made Snowy find where the treasures were, Baili Xian’s group intended to take advantage of him!

Moreover, they even wanted to take it all for themselves!

That made Yang Ye extremely unhappy!

Since they wanted it all for themselves, he intended to give them nothing!

Baili Xian’s expression changed when he saw that Yang Ye actually intended to attack. He hadn’t expected Yang Ye to actually insist on attacking him after the expert within had spoken!

He didn’t have time to think further because Yang Ye had appeared before him.

Baili Xian overlapped his palms and pushed them forward.

However, a wave of mysterious energy suddenly appeared, and then his pupils constricted, “You… this… this is a Domain…”

What he got in response was a sword to his head!

Heavenrend!

It was Heavenrend again! However, it has undergone a qualitative change in strength!

Hiss!

Baili Xian moved far backwards, and as soon as he stopped himself, his arms cracked open. A moment later, his arms cracked into pieces that fell to the ground.

Both his arms were crippled!

Yang Ye didn’t stop and intended to attack once more. However, the golden light above Baili Xian suddenly floated up, and then it transformed into a beam of golden light that surged towards Yang Ye.

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly. He waved his sword incessantly and numerous rays of sword energy shot out.

Bang! Bang! Bang!

Explosions resounded incessantly, and the space there shook madly.

As for Yang Ye’s sword energy, they grew fewer and fewer while his figure was being pushed back incessantly.

Just like that, Yang Ye was pushed around 3km back before his sword energy and the golden light vanished.

Besides that, Baili Xian and the other man had vanished as well.

That beam of golden light was Baili Xian’s final trump card, and he’d decisively retreated when he realized that it couldn’t kill Yang Ye.

Yang Ye frowned slightly when he noticed that Baili Xian had fled, but he didn’t give chase because it was a waste of time.

Yang Ye lowered his sword and turned around to gaze at Nansi Yin, “Let’s go!”

“How strong are you?” Nansi Yin asked abruptly. Every time she thought Yang Ye had given it his all, the facts proved that he was still able to surprise her every single time.

Yang Ye glanced at her and asked, “What about you?”

“Me?” Nansi Yin was stunned, “What do you mean?!”

Yang Ye grinned and didn’t say a word. Nansi Yin had been avoiding attention a little too much all along the way, and it was to the point that others would overlook her. However, Yang Ye was very well aware that she was not ordinary. If the eldest young miss of a large clan was ordinary, then that clan would be utterly trash!

Both of them walked into the cave in the mountain without saying another word.

The cave wasn’t pitch black, and there was faint fluorescent light coming from all around it.

It didn’t take long for Yang Ye and Nansi Yin to stop.

There was a white robed old man seated cross-legged there.

The old man opened his eyes and sized up Yang Ye and Nansi Yin. In the end, his gaze descended upon Yang Ye, and it didn’t take long for him to frown slightly, “Slaughter intent, sword intent, the Sword Domain, and a few types of karma…”

Yang Ye glanced at the old man. Obviously, this was the Sage.

After all, there were truly very few who could see through him!

A short while later, the old man shook his head, “Can you let me see that little fellow from before?”

Snowy!

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment before summoning Snowy.

Once Snowy emerged from the Primordial Pagoda, she sized up the surroundings before looking at the old man. After that, she actually flew over to the old man’s shoulder and patted it lightly.

Snowy was being very friendly!

Surprise flashed through Yang Ye’s eyes because he rarely saw Snowy being so friendly to a human!

The old man grinned, “A Sprite Lord. No wonder you were able to get in here. So it was because of her!”

Yang Ye asked, “Senior, so you didn’t plan to let anyone in?”

The old man shook his head, “Of course not. However, I wanted to meet someone kindhearted and benevolent.”

Nansi Yin couldn’t help but laugh. She glanced at Yang Ye while a teasing gaze filled her eyes.

Kindhearted and benevolent! Yang Ye was nothing like that!

Meanwhile, Snowy pointed at Yang Ye and waved her claws.

She was saying that Yang Ye was a good person!

The old man grinned, “Why are you staying with him?”

Snowy blinked, flew over to Yang Ye’s shoulder, and then started waving her claws at the old man.

Good!

Snowy was saying that Yang Ye was good, very good.

Yang Ye grinned from ear to ear.

A short while passed before the old man grinned, “True. Good and bad are different for every person. Come over here!”

Snowy blinked. She wanted to go over, but she gazed at Yang Ye first. Yang Ye nodded.

Once she saw Yang Ye nod, she stopped hesitating and flew over to the old man before sizing him up with a curious gaze in her eyes.

The old man suddenly stretched out his hand and placed it on Snowy’s head. A moment later, a stream of pure white energy entered Snowy.

Yang Ye asked, “What’s that?”

Suddenly Nansi Yin said, “Sage Aura!”

Yang Ye gazed at her. She took a deep breath while a trace of envy could be seen in her eyes, “Do you know what it can do?”

Yang Ye shook his head.

Nansi Yin explained, “It has many uses. For example, improving lifespan. A portion of Sage Aura can increase a person’s lifespan by 100 years, cleanse the body, and change a person’s physique. Besides that, one who possesses Sage Aura is immune to all evil. So, many shaman techniques of the shaman race and some other evil techniques won’t affect that little fellow at all. Unless the technique is executed by someone comparable to a Sage. Besides that, someone with Sage Aura won’t suffer from any inner demons while advancing to realms of cultivation below the Sage Realm, they won’t encounter any inner demons or barriers!:

Nansi Yin took another deep breath and continued, “Most importantly, it comes with Sage Protection.”

Yang Ye gazed at her, “Sage Protection?”

She nodded, “One who obtains Sage Aura also obtains Sage Protection. Simply speaking, she has the ability to launch the attack of a Sage. Do you know how terrifying such an attack is? Let me explain it like this. That little fellow of yours can execute it to instantly annihilate a peak Enlightened Realm expert! As for those above the Enlightened Realm, they’ll be heavily injured or crippled even if they survive it!”

Yang Ye was stunned speechless.

“Oh great!” Meanwhile, a cry resounded in the Primordial Pagoda.

It was from Hou Qing, of course. Once Snowy had such an ability, she would be even more difficult to deal with. Or it should be said that she absolutely couldn’t be offended.

Qiong Qi shook his head too. Now that Snowy had such an ability, they would have to tremble before her.

Yang Ye was extremely excited instead. Compared to getting it himself, he was happier that Snowy had gained something.

Nansi Yin glanced at Snowy with a complicated expression in her eyes, “What a lucky fellow!”

Meanwhile, the old man withdrew his hand.

Snowy blinked. Even though she didn’t know what had happened, she still cracked a smile towards the old man.

Meanwhile, the old man gazed at Yang Ye, “Since she’s staying with you, it proves that there’s kindness in your heart. Even though it’s a selfish form of kindness, you still have kindness in you. But you can’t get my inheritance!”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Why?”

The old man grinned, “Because you’ve inherited another person’s Path in the Dao!”

Yang Ye’s expression changed. He hadn’t expected the old man to have even been able to see through that.

The old man smiled, “While you can’t inherit my Path, fate still brought us together.” He suddenly stretched out his hand and gestured.

The sword which held up the city shook violently, and then it shot up into the sky and pierced through space. It appeared in the old man’s grasp. However, at this moment, it had returned to a normal size!

The sword’s departure caused the city to drop to the ground. But it wasn’t damaged at all.

The old man glanced at the sword while complicated emotions filled his eyes, “This sword was made by an old friend of mine. It’s called Spiritbreaker!”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Spiritbreaker?”

The old man grinned, “At your realm of strength, the treasures you come into contact are at the Imperial Rank, Saint Rank, or Divine Rank. This sword isn’t within the scope of any of those ranks. It’s made specially to break the spirit within things. So long as they aren’t being enhanced by a Sage, treasures at the Divine Rank or below will lose their power from just coming into contact with this sword, it’ll transform them into ordinary items!”

Awesome! Yang Ye’s eyes lit up. Snowy’s eyes had lit up too. Since she started cultivating in the sword, she was especially fond of them!

Yang Ye suddenly asked, “How did it break?”

The old man grinned, “Everything has a spirit of its own, so Spiritbreaker harms the balance. Thus, I broke its tip, but I never imagined it to still be so strong after losing its tip. However, it can only destroy treasures at the Divine Rank and below. If it was at its prime, it can destroy treasures even if they’re being enhanced by a Sage!”

What a pity!

Yang Ye felt that it was quite a pity. However, it was fine. Because he intended to make the Divine Yin Flame reforge it when he could!

Meanwhile, the old man suddenly asked, “Young Brother, I have a request!”

Yang Ye gazed at the old man, “Please go ahead!”

The old man smiled, and then he gazed at Nansi Yin, “Please help me send her out of this place later!”

Yang Ye was puzzled, and so was Nansi Yin.

The old man explained, “Since the door has been opened, it represents that the heavens want me to vanish from this world. My Path can’t be broken and lost once I vanish from this world.”

He gazed at Nansi Yin and continued, “Little girl, if you take my inheritance, you can’t act against the heavens, you can’t kill when it conflicts with your own sense of right and wrong, and you can’t bring harm to the human race. Are you willing?”

Nansi Yin took a deep breath and spoke in a trembling voice, “I am!”

The old man smiled and gazed at Yang Ye, “Everyone stays away while I’m here, but once I’m gone, there may be countless who come to take my inheritance from her. Young Brother, are you willing to help me take her to safety?”

Yang Ye glanced at the sword before him. Since he’d taken from the old man, he naturally wouldn’t refuse.

He had to repay the old man’s kindness!

Yang Ye nodded, “Of course!”
