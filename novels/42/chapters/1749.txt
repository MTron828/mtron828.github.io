Chapter 1750 - Undying Black Phoenix!

Everyone gazed at Yang Lianshuang, including Yang Ye.

They watched as a tremendous change occurred throughout her body. At this moment, her hair, eyes, and even clothes had turned pitch black. Most importantly, her aura was filled with power and viciousness. It was merely inferior to Yang Xiang!

Yang Xiang gazed at Yang Lianshuang for a long time before he said, “If memory serves, there are True Dragons and True Phoenixes amongst the ancient cultivators. The True Phoenixes are divided into the Black Phoenix and Divine Phoenix branches. If I’m not wrong, you’ve obtained the Undying Black Phoenix’s inheritance!”

The Undying Black Phoenix! Yang Lianshuang gazed at Yang Xiang and replied, “Yes, it’s the Undying Black Phoenix.”

Suddenly, an old man stepped forward from behind Yang Lianshuang. The old man bowed respectfully to Yang Xiang and said, “Ancestor, Yang Xiao is dead, and the talented young masters of my Yang Clan have perished. Presently, only Young Miss Shuang and Young Master Ye are left. If both of them are dead, there’ll be a period where my Yang Clan has no one capable. So, please reconsider your decision, Ancestor!”

Meanwhile, another old man behind Yang Lianshuang stepped forward and said, “Ancestor, Young Miss Shuang and Young Master Ye’s natural talent can definitely be ranked in the top five of our clan’s history. Any one of them can bring prosperity to our Yang Clan, and if they join forces, our Yang Clan will definitely surpass the glory of our ancestors.”

Many members of the Yang Clan nodded with agreement, and the people behind Yang Lianshuang revealed excitement in their eyes.

Yang Ye and Yang Lianshuang were peerless geniuses. If they joined forces, it was obvious how glorious the Yang Clan’s future would be!

As for the experts of the Ying Clan and Ku Clan, their faces had turned gloomy.

Yang Ye and Yang Lianshuang were sufficient to pose a threat to them. Even though Yang Ye and Yang Lianshuang weren’t a threat to them for now, once such monstrous geniuses grew, they would be absolutely terrifying, and if such monstrous geniuses joined forces after maturing…

The Ying Clan and Ku Clan’s experts didn’t dare continue on this line of thought.

A moment of silence ensued, and then Ying Wu suddenly gazed at Yang Xiang, “Senior, my Ying Clan once obtained an incomplete library, and it was left behind from the ancient times. It had records of many things from the ancient times. One of them was information about the Black Phoenix.”

Yang Xiang gazed at Ying Wu, “What are you trying to say?!”

Ying Wu grinned, “I think Yang Lianshuang hasn’t just obtained a Black Phoenix’s inheritance, she has probably devoured a Black Phoenix. Of course, her strength is definitely insufficient to accomplish that. So, there’s only one explanation, that Black Phoenix willingly allowed her to devour it.”

Yang Xiang said, “Get to the point!”

Ying Wu nodded, “If I’m not wrong, her heart is the heart of a phoenix.” A smile curled up on the corners of his mouth, and then he gazed at Yang Xiang, “Senior, if I’m to be honest, I presume you’ve been in closed door cultivation with the goal of breaking the shackles of the True Realm and rise above it. However, based on the current situation, you’re probably not confident in your chances, right?”

Yang Xiang’s face was quite gloomy.

Meanwhile, Ying Wu suddenly pointed at Yang Lianshuang, “Senior, the Black Phoenix is called the Undying Black Phoenix. The reason it’s called that is because of its undying heart. Senior, if you’re able to devour that heart, then even if you can’t advance above the True Realm, you’ll definitely be able to gain new life. Because that undying heart is absolutely capable of extending your life by another 500 years at least! Anything is possible once you have another 500 years!”

“Nonsense!” Meanwhile, the old man by Yang Lianshuang’s side spoke angrily, “You’re trying to sow discord amongst us!”

Ying Wu glanced at that old man, and then he gazed at Yang Xiang, “I’m just giving you a suggestion. The choice is yours.” As soon as he finished speaking, he moved aside and didn’t say another word.

The old man by Yang Lianshuang’s side gazed at Yang Xiang, “Ancestor, he can’t be believed. Our Yang Clan…”

Yang Xiang interrupted the old man, “I only have ten years left!”

The old man’s eyes opened wide when he heard this, and they were filled with disbelief. Because Yang Xiang’s decision was obvious.

The old man intended to convince Yang Xiang, but Yang Lianshuang waved her hand, “There’s no need to say anything.” She gazed at Yang Xiang and said, “If I’m not wrong, besides life and death, someone at your level has probably no interest in anything else, and that includes the Yang Clan. The Yang Clan’s rise or fall is meaningless to you, right?”

Yang Xiang nodded, “The clan? Its future? Haha! At my level, you’ll realize that everything besides life and death are worthless.” He gazed at Yang Lianshuang and continued, “I know the Ying Clan doesn’t have good intentions, but I don’t care. As far as I’m concerned, it’s an opportunity and hope for me. So, will you dig out your heart on your own, or shall I help you?”

Yang Lianshuang suddenly started laughing. She laughed for a while before she gazed at the group of experts who’d been supporting Yang Xiao earlier, “See? This is the guardian of the Yang Clan whom all of you’ve been relying on. All of you treat him as your guardian deity, but as far as he’s concerned, you may not even be ants.”

All of them remained silent.

The reason the Yang Clan had been able to become one of the eight great clans was because it had two 6th stage True Realm experts, and those experts were the pillars of support in the hearts of all the Yang Clan’s members. However, they realized that the person they relied on didn’t care about their clan.

Their pillar of support had crumbled!

At this moment, the pillar of support in the hearts of countless had collapsed.

Yang Xiang nodded slightly, “Since you refuse, then I’ll get it myself!”

He took a step forward once he finished speaking, and the space here shook violently. In an instant, the space around Yang Lianshuang was suddenly warped and twisted.

A vicious glow flashed through Yang Lianshuang’s eyes, and then a ray of black light swept out from her. The black light instantly tore up the space before her into pieces, and then she tapped her right foot down and transformed into a ray of black light that shot at Yang Xiang.

Yang Xiang shook his head slightly, and then he stretched his right hand forward before twisting it swiftly. The space before him instantly warped into a huge ball of spatial energy, and then it exploded apart.

Boom!

Yang Lianshuang was blasted 3km away. As soon as she stopped herself, the space before her rippled violently before it suddenly transformed into sharp spatial spikes!

A moment later, these spatial spikes had enveloped Yang Lianshuang.

The expressions of Yang Lianshuang’s supporters had turned gloomy from the sight of this. Suddenly, an explosion resounded, and the space there collapsed and was obliterated. At the same time, a huge black claw flashed out from there and clawed at Yang Xiang.

Yang Xiang’s face remained calm as he tapped his finger forward, “Transform!”

The space around the huge black claw actually started disintegrating. It wasn’t just space that was disintegrating, even the huge black claw suffered the same fate. In just a short while, the black claw had been split into thousands of bits and vanished in the air.

Yang Lianshuang’s eyes narrowed slightly, “World Modification!” 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Yang Xiang gazed at her, “Looks like you know quite a bit. The 6th stage of the True Realm, World Modification. It allows one to easily modify the Laws of the world and transform everything in the world. So, no matter how monstrous you are, you’re just an ant before me. Of course, you’re a comparatively stronger ant!”

He took a step forward once he finished speaking, and the surroundings changed along with that. The space around Yang Lianshuang suddenly split apart, or to be more precise, their structure was being changed, and he was using space to attack her after changing their structure.

It was quite similar to Oblivion Maiden’s attacks. However, Yang Xiang’s attainments were much greater than hers because he wasn’t just splitting them apart, he was modifying them.

It was easy to destroy but difficult to change!

Yang Lianshuang slowly clenched her claws, and then she overlapped them and pushed them forward in Yang Xiang’s direction.

Bang!

The space in an area of over 1km around her rumbled and collapsed. However, once space collapsed, the black hole which was created from this started to spin, and then the black hole actually started to split apart!

But it didn’t take long for the black hole to suddenly stop.

Meanwhile, Yang Xiang gazed at Yang Ye, “Interesting! The energy of your Laws is actually able to stop my modification!”

It was Yang Ye who’d stopped it just now. He had to, of course. He was on the same boat as Yang Lianshuang. If she died, it wouldn’t benefit him at all. Conversely, he could only deal with Yang Xiang by joining forces with her!

Yang Ye didn’t answer Yang Xiang. He gazed at Yang Lianshuang. At this moment, there was a wisp of blood on the corner of her mouth.

Yang Ye asked, “Are you alright?”

She wiped off the blood and said, “Shall we kill him?”

Yang Ye nodded, ‘Of course!”

“We’re willing to lend you a hand!” Suddenly, Yang Lin led the others behind him and went over to stand behind Yang Lianshuang.

Yang Lin wasn’t the only one. All the others who supported Yang Xiao previously had gone over to stand behind Yang Lianshuang.

The experts of the Ying Clan and Ku Clan were stunned by this scene.
