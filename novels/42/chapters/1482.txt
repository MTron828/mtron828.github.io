Demon Wu shook his head when he saw Yang Ye attack, “Ant!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he waved his hand and a gust of powerful wind surged forward.

As far as he was concerned, not to mention a Voider, even a Deity was an ant!

Bang!

Unexpectedly, the powerful gust of wind hadn’t even arrived before Yang Ye when a strand of mysterious energy obliterated it. After that, Yang Ye arrived in front of Demon Wu, and then he held the casket lid with both hands as he slammed it down towards Demon Wu!

A wisp of surprise flashed through Demon Wu’s eyes. He hadn’t expected his attack to be unable to kill Yang Ye in an instant. But he didn’t have the time to think about it because Yang Ye’s casket lid was above his head.

Demon Wu slapped his palm up against Yang Ye’s casket lid.

Bang!

Powerful energy of Yin and Yang blasted Yang Ye around 3km away. However, Demon Wu was pushed over 300m away as well!

Lian Banzhuang’s eyes opened wide at the sight of this. Based on her expectations, Yang Ye should have been killed in an instant. She had never imagined that he wouldn’t just be able to survive, he would even be able to push a Dualism Realm expert back.

Her gaze fell onto Yang Ye. Is he really just a Voider?

Lian Banzhuang wasn’t the only one who was shocked. Demon Wu’s eyes were filled with shock as well. He hadn’t expected that he would actually be pushed back by an ant at the Voider Realm!

Besides shock, there was a trace of curiosity and bewilderment in Demon Wu’s eyes. Is that fellow really just a Voider?

Yang Ye’s eyes were filled with excitement. He hadn’t expected that he would actually be able to push a Dualism Realm expert back. However, he was very well aware that there were two reasons that contributed to his success. Firstly, it was the improvement in his physical cultivation. He was at the Undying Realm now, so his strength was on par with the Ancient Emperor Python. Secondly, it was the casket lid! It was also the main reason!

The casket lid was extremely heavy. Even if his body had risen to the Undying Realm, it was quite strenuous for him to lift it. The joint force coming from the weight of the casket lid and his own strength caused the explosive force his attacks carried to be extremely terrifying. Coupled with the fact that the old man had underestimated him, his attack had been able to blast the old man back!

Even then, Yang Ye was excited. Because it represented that even if he couldn’t defeat a Dualism Realm expert, he could still fight one! However, he didn’t know how long he would last in battle against one.

“You’ve really surprised me!” Meanwhile, Demon Wu gazed at Yang Ye’s casket lid, “Even though that thing is the main reason your attack was so strong, you’re not ordinary as well. I’m really curious. Who are you? What are you doing here?”

Yang Ye glanced at Lian Banzhuang. At this moment, she was still absorbing the Primordial Violet Energy he’d given her. Yang Ye remained silent for an instant and said, “I came from the outside!”

“The outside?” Demon Wu’s eyes narrowed slightly. He was about to ask a question when he seemed to have thought of something, and he immediately gazed at Lian Banzhuang. After that, he gazed at Yang Ye, “You’re trying to buy time!”

Yang Ye was about to speak when Demon Wu suddenly vanished on the spot.

Yang Ye’s eyelids twitched at the sight of this. He didn’t hesitate to lift the casket lid and swing it forward!

Boom!

An explosion resounded, and then Yang Ye was blasted 1km away again. As for Demon Wu, he was pushed around 300m back.

Force worked in both directions. Demon Wu had attacked with powerful force, but the casket lid in Yang Ye’s hands had obstructed that force. Moreover, some of the force from the collision was even rebounded. Coupled with the force created by Yang Ye’s full strength, Demon Wu had been pushed back.

Of course, it was worse for Yang Ye. Even though the casket lid possessed abnormal defensive capabilities and had stopped Demon Wu’s attack, most of the force within Demon Wu’s attack had still struck Yang Ye through the casket lid. Fortunately, his body was at the Undying Realm now. So, such injuries were nothing to him!

After all, he had Primordial Violet Energy, and it could repair his body as soon as possible!

Demon Wu was clearly infuriated from being pushed back again, and the indifference and calm in his eyes had vanished. There was only coldness and the intent to kill within them. A moment of silence ensued, and then his figure shot towards Yang Ye. Once he arrived around 6m above Yang Ye, he clenched his fist and slammed it down at Yang Ye.

His fist carried the energy of Yin and Yang. Coupled with the fact that he hadn’t held back at all, his fist immediately blasted a huge and deep hole open around Yang Ye. Moreover, the space around Yang Ye and the old man was rippling like waves were running through it. It was an extremely shocking sight.

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly. At this moment, he couldn’t retreat. As soon as he did that, he would fall into a disadvantaged state, and he would suffer endless attacks instead. Moreover, his speed wasn’t sufficient to retreat. So, he could only go head-on against it.

Yang Ye didn’t hesitate to lift the casket lid and flicked it upwards at an angle.

Bang!

A loud explosion resounded, and then Yang Ye was smashed into the ground along with the casket lid. However, Demon Wu was blasted around 600m back as well!

Demon Wu’s countenance was slightly pale, and his right hand was trembling lightly. He glanced coldly at the spot Yang Ye had been standing on.

At this moment, Yang Ye had been slammed into the ground, and his figure wasn’t visible anymore.

Demon Wu remained silent for an instant, and then he turned to look at Lian Banzhuang who was still healing, “Let me see who can save you now. Our years of enmity are finally about to end!”

As he spoke, he was about to attack. However, his expression changed, and then he gazed at where Yang Ye had been standing before their collision. At this moment, a hand had emerged from beneath the ground, and then Yang Ye crawled out of the hole.

Demon Wu stared fixedly at Yang Ye, “You’re still alive!”

At this moment, Yang Ye’s countenance was ghastly pale, and there was blood on the corner of his mouth. Based on his outer appearance, he was clearly injured. However, he was alive. Why was he alive? He had the casket lid, his body at the Undying Realm, and the heaven defying recovery speed of the Primordial Violet Energy. So, how could he have possibly died?

Yang Ye wiped the blood off the corner of his mouth, and then he walked towards Demon Wu while holding the casket lid in his arms, “Is that all a Dualism Realm expert has? Come! Let’s continue!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he stomped his right foot down, and he shot forward like a cannonball. When he arrived around 3m before Demon Wu, he raised the casket lid and smashed it down.

Boom!

Yang Ye’s figure was blasted flying again. Just like before, Demon Wu was pushed back as well. However, just a moment passed before Yang Ye charged at Demon Wu again.

A wisp of gloominess flashed through Demon Wu’s eyes. A moment later, he attacked again. As expected, Yang Ye was blasted flying again. But it didn’t take long for Yang Ye to charge over with the casket lid!

Yang Ye was blasted flying over and over again, but he charged at Demon Wu over and over again as well. Just like that, Yang Ye forcefully engaged Demon Wu in combat for around an hour!

Demon Wu was clearly infuriated by Yang Ye, and his attacks grew stronger and stronger. However, Yang Ye was able to resist them with the casket lid. Demon Wu had specially attacked Yang Ye’s casket lid on many occasions. However, he failed. The casket lid’s strength had surpassed his imagination, and it was to the extent that he wasn’t just unable to destroy it, he even suffered internal injuries from the rebound!

As for Yang Ye, logically speaking, he should have suffered even more severe internal injuries. However, besides another strand of blood on the corner of his mouth, he seemed completely fine after every single collision!

Demon Wu gazed at the casket lid. Yang Ye’s strength was utterly insufficient to resist his energy of Yin and Yang, but the casket lid could! So, he was actually helpless against Yang Ye!

He remained silent for a moment, and then he flipped his palm. A mirror flashed up and arrived above Yang Ye.

A moment later, a beam of pitch black lightning emerged from it, and it was even slightly larger than the one Yang Ye had seen earlier.

Yang Ye’s eyes were filled with an extremely solemn expression. He didn’t dare act carelessly, and his profound energy surged madly before entering the casket lid.

Meanwhile, the beam of lightning had arrived above him. Yang Ye raised the casket lid to shield himself from it.

Boom!

Yang Ye and the casket lid were slammed deep into the ground.

Lian Banzhuang’s eyes narrowed slightly at the sight of this, and she gazed at Demon Wu. Meanwhile, Demon Wu looked at her as well, “An ant is an ant. He dares to try and stop me? How laughable…”

Cough!

Suddenly, a soft cough came from within the deep hole, and then Yang Ye crawled out from it with the casket lid.

Yang Ye was in an extremely embarrassing state right now. His grey hair had turned jet black. Besides that, only his underpants remained. But the casket lid in his hands was completely unharmed and remained completely the same!

Demon Wu’s face became extremely unsightly when he saw Yang Ye. He’d thought that his attack would be able to obliterate Yang Ye, but he hadn’t expected Yang Ye to still be alive!

Aren't his defenses a little too strong?

Meanwhile, Lian Banzhuang’s expression eased up slightly when she saw Yang Ye. She glanced at him, withdrew her gaze, and then continued healing herself with the Primordial Violet Energy that Yang Ye had sent into her body.

Yang Ye wiped off the blood on the corner of his mouth, and then he looked up at Demon Wu who had an unsightly expression on his face, “Come! Let’s continue!”

Demon Wu was at a loss for words.
