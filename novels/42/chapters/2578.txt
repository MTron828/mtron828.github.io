Chapter 2579

Death!

Yang Ye closed his eyes slowly within the Boundless Water. At this moment, he sensed the aura of death!

The true aura of death!

He hadn’t felt the aura of death in a very, very long time! Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Everything was pointless!

Nothing made a difference!

At this moment, he thought of Su Qingshi, Xue’er, Snowy, Erya, and all the others…

Scenes flashed before his eyes.

As time passed, he realized that he didn’t want to die!

Or it should be said that he was afraid of death!

He was afraid for Su Qingshi and the others once he died? And what about the Ancient Sword Sect? What about Snowy and Erya? Especially Snowy, how sad would she be? Moreover, who would take care of Snowy if he died? Who would take care of Su Qingshi and the others?

He couldn’t rest at ease no matter who was taking care of them!

“No! NO!” A powerful desire to live arose in Yang Ye’s mind.

“I can’t die!” Yang Ye struggled madly. His sword intent, Sword Domain, and everything else he could use was activated. However, no matter what it was, they didn’t change anything!

They were of no effect!

Yang Ye fell into despair!

True despair!

It wasn’t the Boundless Water that made him feel despair, it was Qi Bitian. Because he sensed her desire to kill!

Qi Bitian wanted to kill him!

He had no chance to survive!

It was time to die!

Utter despair filled him!

Yang Ye started to stop struggling because it was all in vain.

In the Primordial Pagoda, Qi Bitian gazed at Yang Ye coldly.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye was on the verge of being unable to survive any longer.

Yang Ye was on the verge of exploding at any moment!

In the Primordial Pagoda, Qi Bitian sighed softly and waved her right hand.

Bang!

Outside the Primordial Pagoda, the Boundless Water around Yang Ye was pushed aside, and then an independent pocket of space appeared around Yang Ye!

It was like he’d gained new life!

Yang Ye returned to the bridge, and then he entered the Primordial Pagoda.

He stood before Qi Bitian.

Yang Ye asked, “Why?”

She shrugged. She didn’t offer an explanation or say anything.

Yang Ye spoke in a low voice, “You wanted to kill me!”

When he jumped in, he realized that he couldn’t cultivate in there at all. Because he couldn’t even move in there. So, how could he train?

Moreover, he did truly sense death approaching just now! Moreover, he sensed Qi Bitian’s desire to kill!

Qi Bitian replied, “If I wanted to kill you, I wouldn’t have to go to such lengths.”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Then why?”

Qi Bitian smiled, “If I’m being honest, I did want to kill you in the beginning. It was when you came to the Abyss for the first time. Because I sensed Erya’s aura then. But at that time, I gave someone face and didn’t act against you. As for the second time we met, I changed my mind.”

She pointed at Yang Ye’s chest, “I’m very curious, curious why Erya would go with you. Right, I noticed that you are pretty good. As for just now, I tried to kill you so that you would sense the aura of death. Do you know what that is? No, you don’t. Even in that battle at the Ancient Sword Sect, you didn’t feel it because you were fearless!”

“Fearless?” Yang Ye spoke solemnly, “What do you mean?”

Qi Bitian chuckled, “What do I mean? Little Yang, are you even lying to yourself now?”

Yang Ye fell silent.

Qi Bitian said, “There is a mysterious expert standing behind you, it’s that young girl who’s around my size! Actually, you sensed her presence a long time ago. It’s because of her that you felt the Ancient Sword Sect could get through it. You felt that you wouldn’t die because she is helping you deal with your strongest enemy. Thus, you were without fear. Besides that, you felt that you had me in your pagoda, and I may lend you a hand at the critical moment. So, you felt even more fearless!”

She smiled at this point and continued, “Earlier, you were able to remain so composed even when facing that old woman because you had nothing to fear. You seem fearless as you stand in this place that is mysterious to you, but it’s actually because you feel that you have nothing to fear. Because you have me.”

Yang Ye still remained silent.

Qi Bitian sat at the side, “Little Yang, this mental state of yours will only bring harm to you. You sensed the aura of death earlier because you sensed my desire to kill. At that time, you felt that you would really die. Because I wanted to kill you. Now, tell me how it felt?”

Yang Ye remained silent.

How did it feel?

He wanted to live!

He had too many things he couldn’t leave behind!

Qi Bitian continued, “Being unafraid of death like that isn’t true fearlessness. Your biggest problem isn’t your lack of strength, it is that there’s a problem in your heart. You had people to rely on, and you became reliant on them without even noticing it.”

She waved her right hand and Executor appeared in her grasp.

She smiled, “I’m not a sword cultivator, but I’ve seen many sword cultivators. Sword cultivators cannot even rely on their own swords, not to mention relying on others!”

As she spoke, she knocked Yang Ye’s head with the sword, “When I say you’re weak, I’m not talking about your strength, it’s your heart. Do you know why that young girl refuses to come see you? Because you’ve made her feel quite disappointed, but she treats you as a loved one. So, even if she’s disappointed, she still helps you. You must stop hoping that she will help you. Before you do something, you should consider if you have the strength to do it, and don’t do it if you lack the strength for it. Just like the Ancient Sword Sect, if you didn’t have her support, then allow me to be honest, you would be dead a long time ago. And Erya and the others will die because of you too.”

As she spoke, she casually stabbed Executor into the ground, “I’ve fully sealed it. Now, all the Divine Treasures and Super Divine Treasures you have are sealed. You have just a single task, and it’s to survive this place. Rely on your own strength to do it. I’ll be honest with you, I won’t help you here. I won’t help you anymore, and no one else will, including that young girl who’s been helping you. Perhaps very few people in this world can stop her, but unfortunately, I just happen to be one of them. Hehe!”

Just as Qi Bitian had said, all the treasures Yang Ye possessed had been sealed!

Completely sealed!

Including the Sword Gourd, the Sword Supreme, and Sword Precursor!

He'd been completely robbed of all his equipment!

Qi Bitian glanced at Yang Ye, “I’m not joking. If you die here, I will take Erya and the Sprite Progenitor, but the people and demon beasts in this pagoda will die with you. You may not have considered that, but it’s fine because I’ve told you, and now you know. Finally, I guarantee that no one will help you here. If you die, you’ll really die. Good luck!”

As soon as she finished speaking, she waved her right hand and Yang Ye left the Primordial Pagoda!

Sealed off!

At this moment, Yang Ye couldn’t sense the Primordial Pagoda anymore because Qi Bitian had sealed it. In other words, he couldn’t return to it anymore.

As for his treasures, she’d taken them all!

Now, he only had himself!

Alone!

Yang Ye had never felt so alone! At this moment, he felt like he was the only person left here!

In the Primordial Pagoda, Lei Lin stared at Qi Bitian, and the latter smiled, “Responsibility, he hasn’t truly realized his own responsibilities. All he has is his hot blood, or to be blunt, it’s brainlessness! Yet now, he is way past the age for that, so if he wants to live well, he needs to grow. Right, in any case, you wouldn’t understand. Come play ball with me…”

Outside the Primordial Pagoda, Yang Ye stood by the bridge in silence.

The Boundless Water below had returned to normal!

A long time passed before Yang Ye laughed with self-ridicule. It turned out that he was just as Qi Bitian had said, he’d been relying on others!

No matter whether he admitted it or not, he had been like that!

He was relying on Tian Xiu and Qi Bitian!

What if they were gone?

Yang Ye took a deep breath and glanced at the surroundings. Now, only he remained!

He had no Super Divine Treasures, divine treasures, or the Primordial Pagoda!

The number one sword of Eternal Kingdom was gone!

He was all alone!

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings, laughed with self-ridicule, and said, “Yang Ye! Oh! Yang Ye! Are you going to be a coward because you don’t have any treasures or people to rely on?”

As he spoke, he restrained his thoughts and walked off into the distance!

Alone!

Not even a sword was with him!

Yang Ye’s objective was very simple, it was to leave this place alive!

He wanted Qi Bitian to know that even without any treasures or people to rely on, he was still the same person!

Qi Bitian’s words hadn’t struck a blow to his confidence. Conversely, it allowed him to realize the problems he had! At this moment, he too wanted to know if he could survive this place!

Not too long later, Yang Ye stopped abruptly because a young man was seated by the bridge.

The young man had a blade of grass between his lips, and there were two deep scars on his face. These scars intersected each other to form an X.

Besides that, he had a broken saber resting on his shoulder!

The young man sized up Yang Ye, “There are very few in the younger generation who have the right to come here. What’s your name?”

Yang Ye was about to speak when he suddenly said, “No, forget it. Take a swing of my saber first. You’ll only have the right to speak with me if you can do that!”

As soon as he said that, his saber shot forward!

It shot straight at Yang Ye!

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly, and then he clenched his fist. A sword condensed into form from sword intent, and then he swung that sword.

Bang!

An explosion resounded, and Yang Ye’s sword exploded apart!
