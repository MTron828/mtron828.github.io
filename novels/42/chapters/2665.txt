Chapter 2666 – Because You’re Dumb!

Fusion!

The three swords had merged into one!

At the instant they merged, a sword howl resounded through the world!

Crack!

In an instant, the impregnable pocket of space here was instantly cracked apart.

The flags that were locking down the surroundings were instantly obliterated as well!

At this moment, the Divine Abode’s master and the others stopped, even Zuo Mu stopped.

However, it was too late for Tai Huntian who was leading the charge.

Because he’d been charging too, too quickly!

Tai Huntian’s eyes had instantly opened wide upon seeing the woman in black. It was like he’d seen a ghost. At the same time, the ferocious expression on his face had been replaced by terror!

Extreme terror!

Destiny!

Why had he fallen into such a state all those years ago?

It was because he felt that he was very formidable and challenged Destiny. Yes, he’d challenged this woman.

And then he suffered!

Now, the reason he’d joined the End World was because he hoped to hide from Destiny. However, Destiny had emerged from within Yang Ye!

What the heck?

That was Tai Huntian’s last thought.

At the moment the swords had merged, the woman in black suddenly flashed forward with a sword in her grasp.

Hiss!

She appeared not too far behind Tai Huntian, and Tai Huntian was still charging forward behind her. It didn’t take long for him to arrive before Yang Ye.

As soon as Tai Huntian’s figure stopped, a drop of blood appeared on his forehead.

He stared blankly at Yang Ye, “Why?”

Yang Ye replied indifferently, “Because you’re dumb!”

Tai Huntian was at a loss for words.

Just like that, everyone watched as Tai Huntian’s figure turned ethereal, and it didn’t take long for this ancient overlord to vanish from the world.

He was dead!

Actually, Tai Huntian had used his full strength at the critical moment, but his Death Energy and Soul Energy were instantly obliterated upon appearing before the woman in black!

They were like trash before her sword!

Utterly weak and useless!

After she killed Tai Huntian with a single swing of the sword, the woman in black gazed at the Divine Abode’s master and the others, “Go on! You bastards are the best at causing trouble! Go on! Cause more trouble!”

The Divine Abode’s master and the others’ expressions were extremely unsightly. At this moment, they were utterly stunned.

Destiny!

What was she doing here?

Why was she here?

It was unusual!

Suddenly, Shui Wubian said, “Yang Ye is in the Destiny Realm too. Why don’t you kill him?”

Yang Ye shrugged, “Let me answer you. It’s because I’m handsome. Understand?”

The woman in black glanced coldly at Yang Ye, and he smiled embarrassedly before moving aside. It was best not to provoke her right now.

She moved her gaze away and looked at Shui Wubian. A moment later, she vanished on the spot.

Shui Wubian’s expression changed drastically, and he instantly unleashed the Water Domain. At the same time, an endless stream of Boundless Water formed a thick wall of water in front of him.

The others watched as the thick wall of Boundless Water was instantly sliced open.

The woman in black was too fast. They only saw a ray of light and couldn’t see her figure.

A short while later, she was behind Shui Wubian, and then a moment later, Shui Wubian’s head fell off his neck.

Hiss!

Blood sprayed out like a fountain!

Shui Wubian’s body gradually turned ethereal and vanished.

It wasn’t just the Divine Abode’s master and the others whose expressions changed from the sight of this, even Yang Ye’s had changed.

Her strength was abnormally formidable!

She glanced at the bloody head to the side and said, “Whether I kill him or not is none of your business! Watch your mouth!”

Yang Ye was stunned.

Meanwhile, Snowy appeared on her shoulder.

The Divine Abode’s master and the others’ eyes burned with greed when they saw Snowy.

The Sprite Progenitor!

That little fellow was their target!

Now, that little fellow was right in front of them! But they could do nothing about it!

Snowy glanced at them, and then she pointed at the woman in black before pointing at herself again. It was obvious that she was telling them that she was with the woman in black!

The Divine Abode’s master and the others’ expressions turned extremely unsightly, “According to my knowledge, the Sprite Progenitor’s main body fought you countless times all those years ago. S-So why are both of you together now?”

The woman in black glanced coldly at the Divine Abode’s master, “You don’t like it? Then fight me!”

The Divine Abode’s master was stunned speechless.

Yang Ye couldn’t bear to watch.

She was really bullying them!

“Retreat!” Meanwhile, a voice resounded from the vortex they’d appeared from earlier.

It was Heng Wangu’s voice.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye hurriedly said, “Don’t let them go! Kill them all!”

The woman in black glanced at him, “You do it!”

Yang Ye smiled embarrassedly, “Calm down. You make the decisions, I’ll just watch…”

Meanwhile, the Divine Abode’s master and the others were retreating.

They would naturally not try to fight at a time like this.

What a joke? How were they supposed to fight? Tai Huntian and Shui Wubian were killed in an instant!

Run!

The woman in black moved her gaze away from Yang Ye and looked at the Divine Abode’s master and the others. At this moment, some of them had entered the pitch black vortex.

She took a step forward, and at the same time, Zuo Mu who was halfway in the vortex suddenly stopped. He turned around swiftly and swung his saber.

He’d drawn his entire saber!

A ray of saber energy flashed.

It was so powerful that it was simply unprecedented to Yang Ye. If he was facing this attack, he wasn’t confident in being able to stop it at all.

The woman’s eyes narrowed slightly, “The Zuo Clan’s Berserk Saber!”

As soon as she finished speaking, she dashed forward and slashed!Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Hiss!

The saber energy was sliced apart by her sword while her figure moved 30m back!

Zuo Mu didn’t attack again after swinging his saber, and he’d turned around and entered the vortex instead.

The woman in black didn’t go after him. She just looked up toward outer space. The space there suddenly trembled, and then a vortex formed.

The woman in black slapped Snowy on the butt, and it slapped her all the way back into the Primordial Pagoda.

In the wooden house within the Primordial Pagoda, Snowy rolled multiple times…

The woman in black glanced at Yang Ye and said, “Let me see what right you had to be chosen by her!”

As soon as she finished speaking, she entered the Primordial Pagoda.

Yang Ye gazed at Erya and said, “Go inside!”

Erya shook her head.

Yang Ye’s face instantly turned cold, “Go inside!”

He was angry!

It was the first time Erya had seen Yang Ye get angry at her. She felt quite aggrieved, but Yang Ye’s face grew colder, “Hurry up!”

Erya hesitated for a moment and said, “Big Brother Yang, be careful!”

She entered the Primordial Pagoda.

Yang Ye looked up. That mysterious existence up there was one that even the woman in black feared.

Obviously, it was not someone easy to deal with.

But it couldn’t be helped, he had to deal with it!

A short while later, a pair of eyes appeared high above.

The eyes looked down like a god looking down upon mortals.

Indifference!

This kind of gaze absolutely displeased Yang Ye. It was like everything was absolutely insignificant before these eyes!

The eyes glanced at the surroundings and noticed nothing.

Yang Ye looked up at the eyes. At this moment, his eyes were filled with terror, and his body was shivering.

The eyes looked down for a long time. At this moment, Yang Ye felt a strand of mysterious energy appear around him.

He felt like he was translucent before it, and all his secrets were visible to the owner of the eyes.

Something worth mentioning was that the Primordial Pagoda was closed, and even he couldn’t sense its presence!

However, the eyes didn’t leave as it previously had. It remained high above with its gaze locked on him.

It had sensed its target twice. While it had failed to locate its target both times, Yang Ye was present at the scene on both occasions.

It had realized that something was off!

Suddenly, a wave of powerful pressure slammed down from above, and then it enveloped Yang Ye. In an instant, Yang Ye was pressed down to the ground.

It had instantly acted against him!

Yang Ye’s face was extremely unsightly. He wanted to fight back, but the strength of it told him that he was powerless against it!

Even the woman in black was hiding from this existence, so how could he fight it?

Suddenly, a voice resounded in Yang Ye’s mind, “Where is she?”

It was quite low, as if it came out from a jar, and it felt indescribably oppressive and heavy.

That existence up there was here for the woman in black!

In the Primordial Pagoda.

Snowy and Erya were about to leave the pagoda, but they couldn’t because the woman in black had sealed it off.

Erya brought Snowy to the wooden house, and she gazed coldly at the woman in black, “Open it up right now or I’ll punch your head apart!”

The woman replied indifferently, “To be honest, I really want to open it up so that you can fight that existence up there. However, whenever I think about how you’ll be killed by that existence, I don’t feel like opening this place up anymore. Do you know why? Because I want to kill you myself once you’re at your prime.”

Erya clenched her fists and was about to attack. She was extremely violent as well, and she usually attacked for the slightest disagreement!

The woman in black wasn’t afraid at all. She may fear Erya a little if the latter was at her prime, but Erya didn’t even have a third of her full strength. Thus, the woman in black didn’t fear Erya at all.

Right when they were about to fight, Snowy suddenly appeared between them. She pointed one pay at Erya and the other at the woman in black, and then she started waving them swiftly!

A short while later, the woman in black spoke coldly, “Can’t you speak?”

Erya gazed at Snowy too, “Snowy, you should learn how to speak!”

Snowy blinked and opened her mouth. No sound came from her, but based on it moved, she was saying—“I can speak. Don’t fight.”

Erya felt speechless.

The woman in black’s face had darkened too.

Outside the Primordial Pagoda, Yang Ye’s entire body started to crack apart, inch by inch. The pressure was growing increasingly stronger.

He was slowly dying!

A short while later, Yang Ye raised his hands, “I-I surrender. I’ve surrendered, so spare me, alright?”
