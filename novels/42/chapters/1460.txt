Chapter 1461 – Spirit Village!

Even though the casket was a treasure, he couldn’t use it.

Because his physical strength was still too weak, he couldn’t lift the casket. But it was fine because he felt that so long as he cultivated the Undying Elemental Body technique and improved his body to the Undying Realm, then his physical strength would definitely be sufficient to use the ice casket. Based on its weight and strength, it would definitely be sufficient for him to use for at least 10 years!

Because he couldn’t move it, Yang Ye asked Little Sky to help him. Once she found out that he wanted it, she acted very generously and gave it to him, and she even helped him move it into the Primordial Pagoda.

The favorable impression Yang Ye had of Little Sky instantly skyrocketed!

What a nice person! Yang Ye really was grateful. Because the ice casket was definitely an extraordinary treasure, but Little Sky had been so generous and given it to him without even a moment’s hesitation!

She was a really nice person!

It could be considered as being repaid for doing good. Earlier, if he became enemies with Little Sky, then not to mention anything else that might happen, he would definitely be unable to obtain the ice casket.

After the ice casket was within the Primordial Pagoda, Yang Ye continued forward.

According to his estimations, he would be arriving at the Forest of Darkness soon.

The Spring of Life!

The objective he’d entered the Ominous Territory with was the Spring of Life. Once he got it, he could relax for some time; if he couldn’t get it, then he would be in big trouble.

Even though he’d lost lifespan in the past, it hadn’t been very serious. He had time to advance in his cultivation. But this time, he’d utilized the Stellar Sword Diagram right after he attained the Voider Realm. Moreover, he’d lost too much lifespan at once. That made him utterly unable to rely on cultivating to improve his strength and advance to a higher realm of cultivation.

He’d just advanced to the Voider Realm yet had to advance to the Semi-Deity Realm. It was absolutely impossible to accomplish something so heaven defying, even if he had the Primordial Pagoda!

After all, cultivating wasn’t like eating. An advancement couldn’t be accomplished just because he wanted it!

Even though the Ancient Emperor Python had joined his side, Yang Ye still didn’t dare to act carelessly. This place was very mysterious, and the people or demon beasts he encountered here were either too strong or too mysterious. Even the slightest carelessness might result in suffering calamity.

After walking for around four hours, Yang Ye finally left the ice mountain. Perhaps it was because of Little Sky, but he hadn’t encountered any danger all along the way. He’d encountered a few white bears along the way, but they just glared angrily at him and didn’t attack. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Once he left the ice mountain, the miasma appeared once more, and it was even thicker than before.

Miasma!

Needless to say, it was an extremely detestable thing. He believed that the miasma played a huge role in why many humans hadn’t been able to return from the Ominous Territory.

The miasma could obstruct vision and divine sense. So, it created a huge problem for the experts that entered the Ominous Territory. Especially those who frequently relied on their divine sense. They would truly become blind and deaf when they came here. However, the miasma didn’t affect demon beasts here too severely. Because they’d grown up here, so they were used to it!

Thus, the humans were at a complete disadvantage here.

Of course, even if the miasma was gone, the humans wouldn’t be able to gain an advantage here. All the demon beasts here were extremely strong, and every one of them was stranger than the last. Actually, as far as Yang Ye was concerned, even the so-called large world may not be as terrifying as this place.

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts and sped up.

No matter how terrifying this place was, he still had to go forward.

“Hmm?” After walking for a long time, Yang Ye suddenly noticed that the miasma here was actually growing fainter, so Yang Ye sped up. After walking around an hour more, Yang Ye noticed the miasma in the surroundings had actually become almost indistinct.

At the same time, a small village had appeared not too far ahead. The village was built against a mountain, and it only had over a dozen houses. Moreover, the houses were spread far apart like there were misunderstandings between the owners. Besides that, the houses seemed very old.

A village! Yang Ye frowned because it was very unusual for a village to appear here!

Should I go in?

Of course I shouldn’t!

Curiosity killed the cat.

He didn’t want to court death and bring trouble upon himself.

However, right when Yang Ye was about to go around, a hand suddenly pressed down on his shoulder.

Yang Ye’s expression changed slightly. He stopped but didn’t turn around. He pondered deeply for a few moments, and then he asked, “What?”

He received no reply.

Yang Ye frowned and continued forward on his path to go around the village. However, the palm suddenly pressed down, and a mysterious force instantly descended upon him, causing him to be unable to move another step forward.

Yang Ye shook his head, “Come on, is it that difficult to say something?”

Meanwhile, the hand on his shoulder suddenly raised its index finger, and it pointed at the small village.

Yang Ye understood that the mysterious woman wanted him to enter the village!

She has been following me so that I would enter the village?

Yang Ye thought for a moment and said, “Can I refuse to go in?”

His intuition told him that nothing good would come of going inside the village.

She didn’t speak, but she waved her finger slightly. Obviously, she was saying no!

Yang Ye asked, “Is it dangerous?”

She didn’t answer, nor did her finger move.

So, it meant that it was dangerous!

Yang Ye fell silent, and the woman didn’t urge him forward. However, every single time he wanted to walk, so long as it wasn’t in the direction of the village, then she would immediately stop him and immobilize him.

Yang Ye spoke solemnly, “What do you want me to do there? Can you tell me in detail?”

She didn’t answer him.

Suddenly, Yang Ye turned around. He was extremely swift, but there was no one behind him when he’d turned around. However, the strange thing was that the woman’s hand was still on his shoulder.

Yang Ye spoke in a low voice, “What exactly do you want me to do in there?”

He received no answer.

Yang Ye shook his head, “I won’t go in unless you tell me everything.” After all, if it was a trap, then wouldn’t he be walking into it?

She didn’t say anything, and her hand just remained on his shoulder.

Yang Ye fell silent. He had the desire to attack. However, he was very well aware that it was very likely that he lost. She was too mysterious. If he couldn’t kill her with a single strike, then she would definitely become his nightmare. Because if she hid in the shadows and launched a surprise attack on him, then he would be absolutely incapable of defending himself against it. Especially when he couldn’t rashly activate the Sword Domain!

Bad luck!

Absolutely bad luck!

Needless to say, meeting her was absolute bad luck. He couldn’t fight her, nor could he flee. Even he didn’t really know what to do.

After standing there for a long time, the mysterious woman’s hand suddenly moved to his back, and then it started to move around on his back.

She was writing!

A short while passed before her hand stopped, and Yang Ye understood what she wanted.

Help!

She’d written that on his back.

Yang Ye wasn’t surprised because she’d definitely been following him for a reason, but he didn’t know her. So, she was obviously seeking help from him.

Yang Ye remained silent for an instant and asked, “Help you with what?”

Her hand started moving again. However, she wrote the same thing — Help!

Yang Ye asked, “Will you stop following me if I help?”

She wrote a single word on his back — Yes!

Yang Ye remained silent for a long time, and then he said, “Fine, I’ll help you.” As soon as he finished speaking, he turned around and started walking towards the village.

Actually, he didn’t want to help. Why? His intuition told him that it would be that easy. But he had no other choice. He had to help even if he didn’t want to! Otherwise, she would definitely not let him leave, and it just so happened that he was helpless against her!

That made him feel quite depressed!

Yang Ye walked step by step towards the village. The village felt similar to that woman — mysterious.

There weren’t any signs of life within the village, nor were there any sounds coming from the village. It was a scene of complete desolation. In short, the more he looked at it, the more off it felt.

If he was in the outside world, he would have nothing to fear. However, this was the Ominous Territory!

Deities were everywhere in this place!

As he got closer and closer to the village, Yang Ye’s profound energy started to surge while a vigilant expression crept up on his face. At this moment, he’d used the Sword Domain to conceal himself. Even then, he still didn’t dare to act carelessly.

It didn’t take long for Yang Ye to arrive at the entrance of the village.

Spirit Village!

The characters ‘灵村’ were written above the entrance.

“Spirit Village?” Yang Ye frowned, and then he continued forward. As soon as he entered the village, a gust of cold wind assaulted him. Even though it was cold, it didn’t affect Yang Ye much. However, the arrival of the cold wind was too much of a coincidence!

Yang Ye didn’t dare act carelessly as he continued forward. The path was completely silent and without any cold wind. However, Yang Ye sensed a strand of ghastly coldness.

Because there was no miasma here, Yang Ye slowly released his divine sense. It didn’t take long for it to sweep through the houses. In the end, he noticed that they were empty.

An empty village? Yang Ye frowned. Suddenly, the mysterious woman placed her palm on his shoulder, and then she lifted a finger and pointed ahead. Obviously, she wanted him to continue forward.

Yang Ye fell silent for an instant, and then he continued forward. All along the way, he ceaselessly scanned the houses with his divine sense. However, he didn’t notice any person or demon beast. At this moment, he was certain that this village was empty.

At this moment, he was really quite curious. He was curious about what she wanted him to help with. He had no doubt about her strength. If she wasn’t strong, then it would have been impossible for her to survive in the Ominous Territory. However, since her strength was so terrifying, then why did she need his help?

Yang Ye couldn’t figure that out no matter how he racked his brains. But it couldn’t be helped because she couldn’t talk to him. Or it should be said that she merely wanted him to continue forward, and she refused to tell him anything else.

It didn’t take long for Yang Ye to walk out of the village under her guidance, and he started walking towards the mountain behind the village. During this period, Yang Ye had tried to ask her what she wanted him to do. However, he received no answer. So, he had no other choice but to continue forward.

After walking for a while, Yang Ye suddenly stopped, and then he looked up into the distance while disbelief filled his eyes, “What... what the heck is all of that?”
