Chapter 2657 – I’m Equally Matched with Destiny!

It didn’t take long for the woman to grab the black sword in one hand and Snowy in the other as she walked into the wooden house.

In the Primordial Pagoda, the other living beings exchanged glances.

No one dared to offend the woman in black!

After all, even the greatest in the Primordial Pagoda were completely subdued by her!

Outside the Primordial Pagoda.

Once Yang Ye entered the spatial rift, he felt a strand of tearing force, and it was so strong that Yang Ye’s expression changed!

Cracking apart!

Yang Ye’s body had started to crack apart!

Yang Ye was shocked, and he hurriedly unleashed the Sword Domain. However, he noticed that the Sword Domain wasn’t strong enough. So, he unleashed the Slaughter Domain, slaughter intent, and sword intent too!

Dual Domains and dual intents were protecting him now!

Once all four of them appeared, Yang Ye felt much better, but the tearing feeling was still very strong!

Yang Ye felt that something was off, but he didn’t have the time to think about what exactly was off.

All he wanted right now was to get through this as soon as possible!

Time trickled by, and the tearing force he endured grew in intensity. Even with two Domains and intents to protect himself, Yang Ye’s body couldn’t endure it any longer and started to crack open slowly.

Fortunately, he had Primordial Violet Energy too!

With the incessant healing provided by his Primordial Violet Energy, his body didn’t shatter completely. However, it was the most painful thing to experience. Because he was in a state where his body couldn’t fully collapse yet couldn’t fully heal either!

In the Primordial Pagoda.

The woman in black shot a glance into the sky from within the wooden house, and she frowned slightly.

Snowy sneaked a glance at her and continued training.

She was training on how to control spirit energy and the Sprite Domain!

Actually, she was working very hard. Because once she grew stronger, she could help Erya and Yang Ye. However, she still wanted to have some fun…

In the wooden house, the woman’s frown gradually deepened. Because she noticed that something was off.

Outside the Primordial Pagoda.

At this moment, Yang Ye was at his limits, his true limits. He felt like his body was on the verge of collapse. No, it should be said that he felt like his body would collapse at any moment!

The powerful tearing force had already torn apart his Domains, and he wasn’t able to protect himself anymore.

Right when Yang Ye’s body was about to fully collapse, he suddenly felt his body lighten.

Yang Ye was stunned.

A short while later, he opened his eyes. At this moment, he wasn’t in the spatial rift anymore.

At this moment, he was in a boundless expanse of space. The surroundings were gray, and he couldn’t see anything around him. It was all an expanse of gray.

“What’s going on?” Yang Ye was full of questions.

Suddenly, Yang Ye felt a strand of suction force appear on him, and then he appeared within the Primordial Pagoda.

Before the wooden house.

The woman in black gazed coldly at Yang Ye, and he was quite puzzled, “Um… Has something happened?”

She spoke coldly, “Do you know where you are right now?”

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and replied, ‘The 7th layer of space?”

She gazed coldly at him for a long time and said, “Are you stupid? You’re in the 9th layer of space!”

The 9th!

Yang Ye was stunned and spoke with astonishment, “How is that possible?!”

She grunted coldly, “Good luck!”

She turned around and entered the wooden house.

Yang Ye was visibly stunned. I’m in the 9th layer of space?

Didn’t she say that I can’t break open the path to the 9th layer of space? Wait!

Yang Ye seemed to have thought of something and leaped up with anger. He hadn’t broken open the space there, it was the space there which had split open itself!

“Dammit! I was tricked!” Yang Ye’s face was extremely unsightly. Obviously, that thing in the 8th layer of space hadn’t sent him to the 7th layer of space, it had sent him to the 9th layer of space!

Wait!

Yang Ye suddenly wondered if that existence had misunderstood! Perhaps it thought he’d come up here from down below and wanted to get to the 9th layer, and so it sent him to the 9th layer?

Regardless of what the reason was, his intuition told him that he may be in trouble.

Yang Ye glanced at the wooden house. The woman had closed her eyes and seemed completely devoid of an aura.

Yang Ye sighed softly because he knew that he couldn’t place his hopes in her!

Yang Ye left the Primordial Pagoda and glanced at the surroundings. This space he was in was exceptionally quiet, or it should be said that it was deathly. It was deathly quiet!

It was unusual!

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings. The space here was absolutely strange!

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and sat down.

Such silence was pretty good too!

Actually, he was quite insecure. He couldn’t leave this place, and what if he encountered something by roaming the area?

Sitting down here felt much safer!

Actually, he wanted to wait for the woman in black to calm down, and then ask her for a way out of here.

She was still angry right now, and he didn’t want to go poke the hornet’s nest!

He just waited like that. Around two hours later, Yang Ye was about to enter the pagoda when footsteps suddenly appeared!

Yang Ye noticed that every single footstep made the space here tremble violently.

Yang Ye’s eyelids twitched when he noticed this. He looked over, and he saw a woman there.

She seemed to be almost 30. She wore a dress with a white base, and there were beautiful roses around its edges.

She walked over to Yang Ye, scanned him, and then grinned, “Oh, a newcomer!”

Yang Ye was stunned!

Because her voice was off! It didn’t take long for him to look at her throat, and he saw… an Adam’s apple!

A man?

Yang Ye was stunned again.

This woman who was as beautiful as a goddess was actually a man?

Seriously?

Meanwhile, the man’s eyes narrowed slightly. Yang Ye’s expression instantly returned to normal, and he said, “I’m new here. May I know what your name is, Miss?”Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Miss!

The man’s eyes lit up when he heard Yang Ye’s method of address, and the desire to kill in his eyes soundlessly vanished. He beamed, “Yin Yang Goddess.”

Yin Yang Goddess?

Yang Ye nodded slightly. Meanwhile, Yin Yang Goddess suddenly sized up Yang Ye and said, “This doesn’t make sense. You shouldn’t have been able to get here with your level of strength. How did you get here?”

Yang Ye laughed bitterly, “By accident. I’m still wracking my brains on how to get back!”

She had a rather strange expression on her face, “You were able to get here, but you don’t know how to get back?”

Yang Ye’s smile grew even more bitter, “I really don’t. Senior, can you give me some guidance?”

Yin Yang Goddess gazed at Yang Ye for a long time, and when she noticed that he didn’t seem to be lying, she said, “It’s very simple. Break open the space here and you can leave!”

Yang Ye shrugged, “But I can’t!”

She frowned, and a short while passed before she sized up Yang Ye again, “You were sent here?”

Yang Ye nodded, “Sort of.”

“Tsk, tsk.” She shook her head slightly, “Amazing. You were actually sent here with such ease, and you survived. Let me guess… Wait, that isn’t necessary. According to my knowledge, there are only two people in this world who possess such strength. However, those two fellows haven’t shown themselves in a very, very long time. Perhaps they’ve even been killed by Destiny!”

Yang Ye was quite curious, “Who are they?”

Yin Yang Goddess raised a finger, “The first is Emperor Li Taixu.”

Yang Ye shook his head. He didn’t know any Li Taixu.

She continued, “And the other is the one known to be a little greater than the heavens, Qi Bitian!”

Qi Bitian!

Yang Ye was stunned, “Senior, you know Qi Bitian?”

She glanced at Yang Ye, “Qi Bitian, the Abyss Lord. No one in our era hasn’t heard of her! All those years ago, she shook the nine heavens on her own, and she completely suppressed Destiny!”

Yang Ye’s eyelids twitched when he heard this. Damn you! Don’t cause trouble!

In the Primordial Pagoda.

The woman in black laughed coldly.

Meanwhile, Snowy sneaked a glance at her and hurriedly started training.

The temperature in the wooden house was a little cold!

That was what Snowy felt right now!

Outside the Primordial Pagoda, Yang Ye heaved a sigh of relief when he noticed that she hadn’t done anything in reaction to those words. He glanced at Yin Yang Goddess and said, “Um, I think Destiny is very strong too!”

He wasn’t trying to compliment the woman in black, he really did think that Destiny was very strong. Even the woman in black, and the woman in white was even stronger!

Yin Yang Goddess shrugged, “Of course. If she wasn’t strong, so many people wouldn’t have died all those years ago.”

Yang Ye thought of something and asked, “Right, I remember that some people down there are hiding from Destiny. Senior, why don’t you have to hide from Destiny?”

“Hide from Destiny?” Yin Yang Goddess laughed coldly, “They are no match for Destiny, so they naturally have to hide. Of course, I’m no match for Destiny as well. However, hehe… The difference between us is that while I’m no match for Destiny, I know how to run! And I can escape! You know… The form of Destiny that wears a black dress has hunted me for dozens of times, but I always escape.”

Yang Ye gazed at him with quite a weird expression on his face. Because this fellow before him seemed very complacent!

In the Primordial Pagoda, the woman in black had an indifferent expression on her face.

Yin Yang Goddess glanced at the surroundings, hesitated for a moment, and said, “Actually, I don’t flee every time. Let me tell you something, I once fought her in the 9th layer of space for ten days and ten nights!”

“Ten days and ten nights?” Yang Ye was stunned and asked, “That long?”

“Of course!” She struck her chest and said, “There are no more than 10 in the world who can fight Destiny, and there are absolutely no more than 5 who can fight her for ten days and ten nights. But I!”

Her voice suddenly grew slightly louder at this point, “Allow me to boast a little. If I use my full strength, we’re definitely equally matched. No, I, Yin Yang Goddess, am absolutely able to bash her up until she begs for mercy!”

Yang Ye was stunned speechless.
