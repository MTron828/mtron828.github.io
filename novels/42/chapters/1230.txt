Chapter 1231 – You Dared To Come Here When You’re All Alone?

After Yang Ye leaped off the shuttle, a wisp of resolve flashed through Yun Banqing’s eyes, and then she closed her eyes slowly as her grip on the dagger grew tighter.

The black robed old man gazed at her and said, “Let the young master go!”

“Let him go?” A ferocious expression appeared on her face as she opened her eyes and looked at the old man, “What’s the point of letting such an animal live?”

As soon as she finished speaking, she suddenly pressed down with her right hand.

Hiss!

Yun Tianming’s head was cut off!

The 3 old men and Qin Sanguan were stunned by this scene. All of them had never expected her to actually kill him! Is she not afraid of death?

After she cut off Yun Tianming’s head, Yun Banqing’s eyes closed slowly. She could have lived if she didn’t kill him, but living would be worse than death for her. But while killing Yun Tianming would result in her death, her mother and younger brother in the Yun Clan would be able to live. Because the black robed old man and the others would absolutely not dare to bully her mother and younger brother without Yun Tianming’s support. Even though their life would still not be pleasant, they would be able to live at least!

“I was right! You really are timid on the outside but unyielding on the inside.” Meanwhile, a voice suddenly arose by Yun Banqing’s ear. She was stunned and opened her eyes, and she saw a familiar face.

It was Yang Ye who’d left and returned.

“You... you didn’t leave!” Yun Banqing looked him in the eyes, “Why?”

Yang Ye joked, “I couldn’t bear to lose you!”

Yun Banqing was stunned. Meanwhile, the black robed old man suddenly spoke fiercely, “You... you bitch! You actually killed the young master! I’ll make living worse than death for you!”

As soon as he finished speaking, the old man was about to attack. However, Yang Ye suddenly stretched out his right hand. In an instant, his entire right hand was covered in countless fiery red dragon scales. A moment later, he clenched his right fist.

Crack!

The space around them instantly cracked open.

Qin Sanguan was astounded and hurriedly shouted, “Watch out!”

Meanwhile, Yang Ye pulled his right arm back before slamming it forward.

Bang!

A terrifying force surged out like a torrent from Yang Ye’s fist. The black robed man was the 1st to bear the brunt or it, and a shrill cry resounded from him as his figure flew backwards. As for Qin Sanguan and the other 2 Emperors, they were blasted back as well.

When they recovered from their shock, Yang Ye and Yun Banqing’s figures had vanished on the shuttle.

Qin Sanguan and the others were stunned on the spot for a long time, and there was astonishment in their eyes. Because that force from before was too terrifying! It felt like it came from an Emperor Rank demon beast!

One of the old men asked in a voice that still carried shock, “Who... who is he?”

Qin Sanguan shook his head and looked down at his palm. At this moment, his palm was trembling, and it was exactly this palm which he’d used to defend himself against Yang Ye’s attack.

Suddenly, the black robed old man appeared before them. At this moment, an extremely obvious strand of scarlet red could be seen on the corner of the black robed old man’s mouth, “No matter who he is, he has to die!”

“If we don’t kill him and take that bitch back with us, then all of us will have to bear the consequences!” The black robed old man gazed at Qin Sanguan at this point and continued, “Brother Qin, you’re responsible for the young master’s death as well. I’m sure you’re aware of the madam’s temper.”

As soon as he finished speaking, the 3 of them vanished on the spot.

Qin Sanguan frowned, hesitated for a moment, and then his figure shot towards Sword God Island as well.

...

Sword God Island.

Yang Ye held Yun Banqing in his arms as he dashed all the way forward, and he was ceaselessly scanning the surroundings. The area in the distance was covered in towering mountains. Just as Yun Banqing had said, the island was filled with sharp sword intent, and while it was weaker than the sword intent on Godfall Mountain, it couldn’t be underestimated.

“Where’s the ruins of the Sword God’s Palace?” asked Yang Ye. The island was so huge, so it would probably take quite some time to find the ruins if he didn’t have a direction in mind. Because he couldn’t utilize his divine sense here. It wasn’t because of the sword intent but the formation that enveloped the island.

Yun Banqing said, “I don’t know!”

Yang Ye was slightly stunned. He looked down at her while she remained in his arms, and she glanced at him and said, “I’ve never been here!”

“Alright!” Yang Ye shook his head and chuckled. Suddenly, his expression changed slightly, and he forcefully stopped himself. He’d only just stopped when a black shadow suddenly shot out from the forest in the distance, and it shot towards him.

Yang Ye wrapped his left hand around Yun Banqing’s waist and freed his right hand before slamming it forward.

Bang!

The black shadow howled with pain as it flew backwards.

Yang Ye glanced at his right hand, and he actually saw a few bloody holes on it. He raised his head and saw that the black shadow was a Quasi Emperor Realm demon beast. It was like a tiger covered in sharp spikes, and it was especially so for its claws. The spikes on its claws were dozens of centimeters long and seemed rather terrifying.

“A Swordspike Tiger!” Yun Banqing said, “Be careful of these demon beasts. Every single demon beast that has been able to survive on the island has experienced and survived the brutal laws of the jungle here.”

Yang Ye nodded. Even though it was only at the Quasi Emperor Realm, its strength surprised Yang Ye a little. Because it was actually able to pierce through his defenses with ease. After all, his physical defense was comparable to an Emperor Realm demon beast!

The Swordspike Tiger gazed ferociously at Yang Ye, but it didn’t dare to step forward.

Yang Ye glanced at it, and then flashed towards the side. Suddenly, the Swordspike Tiger roared with fury and dashed at Yang Ye. Yang Ye stopped when he saw that, and then a cold glow flashed through his eyes as he gazed at it. After that, he stomped his right foot against the ground and vanished on the spot. He was in front of it when his figure appeared once more, and he slammed his fist against its head.

Bang!

The Swordspike Tiger howled with pain and was blasted away!

Yun Banqing glanced at Yang Ye and remained silent, but tempestuous waves of shock were surging through her heart. Because his physical strength made her doubt if he really was human.

After he blasted the Swordspike Tiger away, Yang Ye was about to follow up with another attack. However, his expression changed, and his figure moved 300m back. Meanwhile, around 100+ Swordspike Tigers appeared around him, and there was a golden Swordspike Tiger amongst them. It was at the Emperor Realm!

Yun Banqing’s face fell at the sight of this.

Yang Ye frowned. These demon beasts were quite troublesome for him if he couldn’t utilize sword intent and his sword.

Meanwhile, Yun Banqing sent him a voice transmission, “Always deal with the leader first!”

Yang Ye’s gaze instantly descended onto the golden Swordspike Tiger when he heard her. After that, he stomped his foot on the ground and relied on the counterforce to shoot forward. In an instant, he arrived before the Swordspike Tiger, and then he slammed his fist forward.

The golden Swordspike Tiger roared with fury when it saw Yang Ye actually attack it, and it transformed into a ray of golden light that shot towards Yang Ye’s fist.

Bang! F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Yang Ye was blasted 300m away, and so was the golden Swordspike Tiger.

Yang Ye blinked and glanced at his fist. Bloody holes had appeared once more on his fist which had been repaired by his violet energy just now.

Yang Ye gazed at Yun Banqing and said, “Its body is really strong!”

“You’re even stronger!” Yun Banqing glanced at him as she spoke. After all, she’d never seen a human actually collide physically with an Emperor Realm demon beast and be equally matched.

“Roar!” Meanwhile, the Swordspike Tiger suddenly howled with fury, and then it transformed into a golden ray of light that shot at Yang Ye.

The Fire Dragon Gauntlets instantly covered Yang Ye’s arm, and then he clenched his right fist and slammed it forward.

Bang!

Yang Ye was pushed around 150m back while the Swordspike Tiger was pushed almost 1km back!

Yang Ye glanced at the Fire Dragon Gauntlets while a slight smile curled up on the corners of his mouth. This thing really is quite good.

Yang Ye raised his head and glanced at the golden Swordspike Tiger. The latter was looking at him as well. At the instant that the gazes of the man and beast collided, both instantly vanished on the spot.

Bang!

Another explosion resounded.

Yang Ye was pushed around 100m back while the Swordspike Tiger was pushed over 600m back.

The Swordspike Tiger revealed a ferocious gaze in its eyes and was about to charge forward once more. Suddenly, a long roar resounded from afar. The Swordspike Tiger’s pupils constricted upon hearing it, and then it immediately turned around and vanished into the dense forest with the other Swordspike Tigers.

Yang Ye was stunned for a moment. Meanwhile, Yun Banqing said, “Its clan has probably encountered some sort of danger!”

Yang Ye said, “Why did they attack us earlier?”

Yun Banqing replied, “We probably entered their territory. I’m sure you’re aware that demon beasts take their territory very seriously. Anyone who enters their territory without permission would be treated as enemies. Moreover, if I’m not wrong, the others who entered the island in the past definitely killed many demon beasts. So, they are very hostile to humans.”

“It’s so difficult for humans and demon beasts to live together in harmony!” Yang Ye shook his head. Actually, he really had no ill intent towards demon beasts. But it couldn’t be helped because while he held no ill intent, it didn’t represent that they held no ill intent towards him.

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts and said, “Let’s go!”

As he spoke, Yang Ye was about to leave. However, the black robed old man from the Yun Clan suddenly appeared not too far away from him.

The old man was stunned when he saw Yang Ye and Yun Banqing, and then his face instantly became ferocious, “I’ve found you!”

Yang Ye was about to flee because just his physical strength alone wasn’t sufficient to fight 4 Emperors. But it didn’t take long for him to notice that the black robed old man was all alone. He glanced at the surroundings and said, “Where are those companions of yours?”

Yun Banqing spoke softly, “They probably split up to find us!”

Yang Ye blinked, and then he turned to look at the old man while he spoke with astonishment, “You dared to come here when you’re all alone?”
