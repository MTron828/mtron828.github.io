Chapter 2162 – I Still Want to Kill!

“Hmm?” The middle aged man looked to the side, and a young girl had appeared there.

It was Tian Xiu.

At this moment, she was looking coldly at the middle aged man, and she didn’t look like a young girl at all.

A wisp of surprise flashed through his eyes as he gazed at Tian Xiu, and a short while passed before he shook his head slightly, “Interesting.”

Tian Xiu walked over to Yang Ye’s side, and her expression was extremely icy cold as she gazed at Yang Ye.

“Interesting indeed!” The middle aged man continued, “I see. Since that’s the case, I should wait a while longer.”

He turned around and left once he finished speaking.

When he arrived at the door, he seemed to have thought of something and stopped, and then he waved his right hand. Something shot out of Yang Ye’s body and entered his sleeve.

In an instant, the middle aged man vanished from the room.

An Nanjing looked up at the sky. At this moment, Tian Xiu had returned to normal, and there was a trace of bewilderment in her eyes. Tian Xiu gazed at An Nanjing, “Big Sister?”

An Nanjing shook her head slightly, “Go to Snowy.”

“Oh!” She nodded while still seeming lost, and she entered the Primordial Pagoda.

An Nanjing fell silent, and no one knew what she was thinking.

Yang Ye was still recovering on the bed.

As time trickled by, Yang Ye’s body was almost fully healed. On the third day, he woke up. However, there was a wisp of scarlet red in his eyes.

It was slaughter intent!

Yang Ye turned around, and he saw An Nanjing by his side.

An Nanjing spoke softly, “You’re awake?”

Yang Ye nodded.

An Nanjing asked, “How do you feel?”

Yang Ye smiled, “Not bad!”

An Nanjing nodded and didn’t say anything.

Yang Ye slowly closed his eyes and scanned his body. At this moment, while his injuries had been practically healed, his internal organs and meridians had some issues. After all, he’d severely over-exhausted himself and had been heavily injured by numerous Sages. Anyone else would be dead by now.

He’d survived!

Yang Ye took a deep breath. Needless to say, An Nanjing and him were very lucky to have survived so many Sages. Of course, he hadn’t forgotten something. He’d realized that while An Nanjing and him could instantly kill Sages, their strength was clearly insufficient when compared to those top-rate powers of the large universe like the Buddhist Path!

Not to mention the Buddhist Path, even the Alliance of All was an existence that they couldn’t rival.

Just the human race had over 20 Sages, so the Sages possessed by the alliance of all the races was far, far more than that.

Meanwhile, An Nanjing suddenly asked, “What are you thinking about?”

Yang Ye gazed at her, “We need to grow stronger!”

She replied softly, “Don’t worry about that. The stronger we grow, the stronger the people we come into contact with will be. There is no strongest expert, only stronger experts. So, take it slow!”

Yang Ye nodded, “Indeed!”

Meanwhile, An Nanjing hesitated for a moment and asked, “Do you know about Tian Xiu’s background?”

Yang Ye asked, “Why?”

She shook her head, “She isn’t ordinary!”

Yang Ye laughed bitterly, “I know that too. She’s extremely formidable. Unfortunately, I too don’t know who she is or where she’s from. But no matter what, she has no ill intent toward us, right?”

An Nanjing nodded, “Come somewhere with me once you’ve recuperated.”

Yang Ye asked, “Where?”

She glanced at him, “I’ll tell you once you’ve recovered!”

Yang Ye felt speechless.

Heal!

After that, Yang Ye started using the Primordial Violet Energy to heal himself. Before this, it had been healing him automatically, so while it was effective, it wasn’t as effective as him doing it himself.

Three days later, Yang Ye’s injuries were almost completely healed.

Yang Ye left the room, and he saw An Nanjing and Lin Zhen outside.

Lin Zhen sized up Yang Ye and asked, “You’re alright now?”

Yang Ye nodded.

Lin Zhen smiled, “Come with me. There are some things which you have to deal with.”

Yang Ye nodded, and then he gazed at An Nanjing. The latter said, “I’ll wait for you!”

Yang Ye smiled, “Alright!”

Yang Ye followed Lin Zhen to a hall. At this moment, many people were in the hall, around 100 to be precise. Moreover, there were even 21 Sages here! The rest were Major Zen Realm experts!

.

As soon as Yang Ye entered the hall, everyone gazed at him.

Most of them had curiosity in their eyes.

While Yang Ye’s reputation was great, few had ever met him.

Lin Zhen said, “Young Brother Yang, everyone here is a representative of the various organizations in our human race. From the east to the west, and the south to the north. Every influential figure is here. It can be said that we’ll be able to truly unite the entire human race with their help.”

All the organizations of the human race were gathered here!

Yang Ye glanced at them and cupped his fist at them, “I’ll skip the introductions and get straight to the point. I want to know why all of you have come here?”

An old man stepped forward and walked over to Yang Ye, “Young Brother Yang, the reason we’re here isn’t important, what’s important is your opinion and views of us and the entire human race!”

Yang Ye fell silent for a moment and replied, “Many humans will die in the future!”

Everyone here was stunned, and there was bewilderment in their eyes.

Yang Ye continued, “All of you aren’t weak, so you should know about the End Times. If it arrives, then it won’t be just our human race, the other races will suffer many losses too.”

The old man asked, “Then what do you plan to do?”

Yang Ye smiled, “What else? Try my best to survive.”

He glanced at them and continued, “Allow me to be honest, all of you definitely have your own plans and schemes. However, if you really want to become united as one, then I advise all of you to give up on those plans and schemes. If the End Times arrive, then everything else but survival is meaningless. Of course, if you think I’m exaggerating, then just forget I ever said anything and just go on with your own business!”

Reorganize the entire human race?

Yang Ye had no intention to do that because it was too tiring.

The heart of man was an extremely complicated thing, and he didn’t like complicated things. He liked things to be simple!

Silence filled the hall.

A long time passed before the old man said, “Young Brother Yang, we came here because we hope to join forces and get through the coming danger.”

Yang Ye nodded, “It’s a good thought because our future enemy won’t just be the End Times, it may include the Alliance of All and other organizations. If all of you don’t join forces, then the human race may be almost annihilated before the End Times even arrive!”

He glanced at them and continued, “I know why you’re here. But if you want to join us, you must do something, and it’s to abandon all those plans and schemes you have. Otherwise, just return to where you came from!”

The others here exchanged glances. Yang Ye’s decisiveness had exceeded their expectations.

A long time passed before the old man said, “It’s a win-win for us to work together!”

“Work together?” A smile curled up on the corners of Yang Ye’s mouth, “Allow me to be honest. Where in this world can’t I go? The reason I’m staying here isn’t because I have deep feelings for the human race, but because Senior Lin Zhen and the other experts of the human race took my side when I was in trouble. If it wasn’t for them, I would have been annihilated outside the endless black holes by the Alliance of All and the Buddhist Path. I will remember that kindness. But what I want to say is that not to mention Major Zen Realm experts, even Sages will seem absolutely weak in the days to come!”

Lin Zhen wanted to say something, but he didn’t in the end.

He wanted to remind Yang Ye not to be so overbearing because these people represented the top organizations of the human race. It could be said that Yang Ye needed their help if he wanted to unite the human race!

If they were willing to obey Yang Ye’s orders, then it could be said that Yang Ye would be just like Emperor Xuanyuan from all those years ago. He would be the true leader of the human race.

After all, even the Sovereign of Man hadn’t been able to truly control the entire human race after years of effort!

It was an opportunity for Yang Ye, but Yang Ye was being quite… However, he knew that while Yang Ye seemed like a rash fellow, he was a very smart young man, and he was a brave yet meticulous person. Of course, Yang Ye wasn’t like that at all times. There were many occasions where Yang Ye was brave and courageous yet didn’t think about anything.

The hall fell silent again.

These organizations had planned to discuss all sorts of conditions, yet now, a few words from Yang Ye had put them at a loss for what to do. Yang Ye’s opinion was very clear, and it was that he didn’t need them!

So, they had two choices.

They could either leave or continue the discussion!

Suddenly, Yang Ye said, “Take your time to think it through, and you can tell Senior Lin Zhen once you’ve made up your mind. I have other things to attend to, so I’ll be taking my leave!” Yang Ye turned around and walked away.

He didn’t want to make An Nanjing wait too long.

All of them exchanged glances.

Right when Yang Ye was about to walk out of the hall, the old man from before spoke abruptly, “Young Brother Yang!”

Yang Ye stopped and gazed at him, “Yes?”

The old man laughed bitterly, “What are your conditions?”

They’d made a compromise!

Lin Zhen heaved a sigh of relief when he heard this. Those organizations had chosen to make a compromise in the end!

Yang Ye pondered deeply for a moment and said, “My condition is actually very simple. I only have two. Firstly, we must unite without any other hidden agendas. I don’t want some of us to be fighting in the frontlines while others are scheming against us. Secondly, while it is bad for the human race to be led by a single voice, it’s not an ordinary time right now, so I need your absolute obedience. Of course, we can learn from the Alliance of All and create a Council of Elders. We can choose 11 supreme experts to assume the role of elder, and when six elders object to a decision of mine, that decision can be annulled. Moreover, they can even remove me from my position.”

The old man hesitated for a moment and was about to say something, but Yang Ye said, “It’s just these two conditions. I won’t engage in any discussion about it.”

The old man laughed bitterly, and then he turned around and gazed at a few Sages. A short while passed before they nodded.

The old man gazed at Yang Ye, “We agree!”

Yang Ye nodded, “Alright, then now, I’ll give my first order. Senior Lin Zhen, notify the Alliance of All and the Buddhist Path, tell them that our human race is declaring war against them!”

A declaration of war!

Everyone here was stunned!

Lin Zhen gulped, “A-Are you serious?”

Yang Ye glanced at Lin Zhen, “Tell them that I didn’t kill enough that day, and I want to kill more!”

Lin Zhen was stunned speechless.T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m
