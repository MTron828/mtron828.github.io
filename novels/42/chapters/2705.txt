Chapter 2706 – Tremble!

Yang Ye rolled his eyes at Snowy. No matter how amazing the sword chest was, it could never be activated without her support.

He’d taken a look at the formation, and it required a huge amount of spirit energy. It could be said that even his own spirit energy may be insufficient. However, Snowy was definitely able to do it! Yet now, the little fellow was actually blaming it on the sword chest.

She knew how to escape from blame now!

Moreover, the sword chest was forced to accept it!

Snowy used both threats and rewards to get it done!

First she promised rewards, and if that didn’t work, she would glare at the thing until it submitted!

Snowy was still quite guilty. She dragged the sword chest over and cracked a smile at Yang Ye.

Yang Ye shook his head, rubbed Snowy’s head, and then looked up at the sky. The five element swords were still in the sky, but there was no spirit energy left in them. They didn’t have the strength they previously possessed, and so the Destiny Dimension had returned to normal.

Yang Ye brought Snowy back to the surface and put the sword away with the sword chest.

He’d underestimated the five swords before this!

Yang Ye brought Snowy to the small house. He knew he couldn’t let her run around anymore. After all, she could destroy a world!

Yang Ye sat cross-legged in the house and placed all his swords before him.

Past Life, Great Unknown, the five element swords, Crimson Sky, Sword Supreme, and the Sword Precursor!

A total of 10 swords!

Snowy blinked on Yang Ye’s shoulder. She wanted to sneak off on many occasions but Yang Ye stopped her.

Yang Ye gazed at the swords for a long time, and then he grinned. A moment later, he returned to the Primordial Pagoda and dragged Snowy along with him!

In the Primordial Pagoda.

Yang Ye started to train!

Unlike in the past, he trained with 10 swords at once!

He’d cultivated to the realm of the Heart Sword a long time ago. It was a realm where the sword was in the heart and not in the hand, and all swords were the same. In other words, even if he had no sword or just an ordinary one, he could still unleash great power!

Of course, there was a huge difference between an ordinary sword and a divine treasure!

His cultivation in the Sword Dao wasn’t at the limits of the Sword Dao yet. Now, he planned to bring forth the strength of all these swords!

Fully utilize them!

In the cultivation room, Yang Ye had the sword chest on his back, Past Life in his right grasp, and Great Unknown in his left grasp. Every swing he made would be accompanied by a sword attacking from the sword chest!

Just like that, it seemed like he wasn’t alone, and there were many of him training in the sword!

The swords moved with him!

Snowy watched Yang Ye with her eyes open wide. That can be done too?

Just like that, Yang Ye cultivated here for around two months.

During this time, he just ceaselessly improved his cultivation while madly training with the sword.

Since he had Snowy’s help, he was just half a step away from the peak of the Destiny Realm!

Most importantly, his cultivation in the Sword Dao was improving incessantly.

His natural talent may not be the best, but the conditions he had were definitely the best in the universe.

The End World.

At a pitch black altar, Heng Wangu, Zuo Mu, and the others waited here.

There was an ugly old man seated cross-legged on the altar, and a crimson red mirror floated before him.

There were numerous corpses around the altar.

Mr. Jing!

The ugly old man was Mr. Jing of the End World, an existence whom very few knew.

A long time passed before Mr. Jing stood up.

Heng Wangu asked, “Mr. Jing, have you found him?”

Mr. Jing nodded, “He’s in a sealed off world, and it should be the abode of another form of Destiny.”

Heng Wangu gazed at Mo Yu, and the latter glanced at the mirror, “I know where he is!”

Heng Wangu nodded, hesitated for a moment, and said, “Mr. Jing, can you locate Destiny?”

Mr. Jing’s eyes narrowed slightly, “Are you trying to get me killed?”

Heng Wangu smiled embarrassedly, “My question was lacking in thought. I apologize.”

Mr. Jing closed his eyes slowly, “It’s best if you don’t provoke them until you’re confident. I know you’ve concealed your strength, but trust me, they are much stronger than you’ve imagined.”

Heng Wangu nodded, “Of course, I won’t underestimate them.”

Mr. Jing nodded slightly, “Go on. Yang Ye will flee if you’re too slow.”Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Heng Wangu and the others left.

Once Heng Wangu’s group left, Mr. Jing withdrew a damaged book. If Yang Ye was here, he would definitely be shocked.

Because the damaged book had some content that was similar to the scripture he possessed. However, it was damaged and incomplete while his was complete.

The old man gazed at the book for a long time. In the end, he spoke softly, “Destiny… An existence that should not exist!”

He shook his head and left.

Heng Wangu arrived at a hall, and then the Divine Abode’s master appeared before him.

The Divine Abode’s master was in charge of most of the End World’s affairs now. Of course, he wasn’t the real leader of the End World. Due to the increase in Yang Ye’s strength, Heng Wangu had stopped asking the Divine Abode’s master to hunt Yang Ye.

Now, even Zuo Mu couldn’t defeat Yang Ye in battle.

The Divine Abode’s master spoke solemnly, “21 have joined us, and six are peak Destiny Realm experts. Three of them are from very, very ancient eras, and they’ve been pursued by Destiny in the past. All of them are asking for Yang Ye’s whereabouts.”

Heng Wangu shook his head and smiled. Since they were asking for Yang Ye’s whereabouts, it was about that they didn’t dare to look for Destiny herself and could only hunt Yang Ye.

Of course, that was normal. Even he didn’t dare to look for Destiny. Because very few could best them in a one-on-one battle!

The Divine Abode’s master asked, “Brother Heng, should I tell them where Yang Ye is?”

Heng Wangu shook his head, “Don’t let them go. They will just be practice for Yang Ye. We are largely responsible for Yang Ye’s swift growth. We’ve sent too many experts that ended up becoming practice targets for him.”

The Divine Abode’s master had quite an unsightly expression on his face. Because most of the experts who’d hunted Yang Ye with him were dead now.

Some died at the hands of Destiny, but some died at Yang Ye’s hands.

Heng Wangu stood up, “I’ll lead the group myself.”

As he spoke, he vanished from the hall.

The Destiny Dimension.

In the Primordial Pagoda.

Yang Ye’s transmission stone shook. He took it out, and a long time passed before he nodded, “Alright.”

He left the Primordial Pagoda with Snowy.

In the Destiny Dimension, Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings, and then he placed Sakura and the sea monster into the Primordial Pagoda. After that, he gazed at Snowy. She blinked and hugged his neck gently.

She had started to admit her mistakes.

Only the woman in black, An Nanjing, Zi’er, and Yang Ye could make her admit her mistakes!

Yang Ye shook his head helplessly, and then he rubbed her head, “We’re going to do something huge later, and I need your help. Understand?”

Snowy quickly nodded.

Yang Ye looked up into the distant sky, and then he chuckled.

Around 15 minutes later.

Heng Wangu and the others appeared outside the Destiny Dimension. He hadn’t just brought Zuo Mu, Mo Yu, and First God, he’d brought two more old men and a middle aged man. The middle aged man was the Sky Saber.

Besides that, there were numerous obscure and extremely powerful auras around the Destiny Dimension!

Obviously, all the peak experts of the End World were here!

Heng Wangu was very well aware that they couldn’t underestimate Yang Ye at all, and they would never succeed at killing him if they didn’t use their full strength.

Heng Wangu didn’t launch an attack, and they even concealed their auras so that Yang Ye wouldn’t find out about their arrival.

Besides that, a mysterious barrier was gradually forming in the surroundings.

Yang Ye had Great Unknown, and he hadn’t forgotten that. So, in order to stop Yang Ye from escaping, he planned to set up a barrier. It only took a few breaths of time for it to be completed.

The entire Destiny Dimension was covered by the formation!

Yang Ye’s Great Unknown could travel through the barrier, but it would take some time. Even if it took just a breath of time, it would be enough for them!

They could stop Yang Ye in that amount of time!

Once the barrier was formed, Heng Wangu was smarter this time and gazed at the Destiny Dimension as he ordered, “Attack!”

He didn’t waste his time talking and giving Yang Ye time.

Numerous terrifying auras swept through space and slammed against the Destiny Dimension.

Boom!

At this moment, the entire Destiny Dimension shook violently, but Heng Wangu and the others didn’t stop and continued their assault.

Two breaths of time later!

Boom!

The Destiny Dimension exploded apart, and a huge black hole appeared before them. They had blocked off the entire aftershock from the explosion!

The surroundings gradually calmed down!

But they saw no signs of Yang Ye!

Heng Wangu looked behind him, and a voice came from there, “I don’t sense him.”

Heng Wangu frowned. A moment later, his face fell, “He left before we arrived.”

Zuo Mu asked, “Where did he go?”

Heng Wangu fell silent for a short while, and then the space before him suddenly shook. A moment later, his face changed drastically, “This is bad! He went to the End World 15 minutes ago! Everyone! Return immediately!”

They vanished on the spot.

15 minutes earlier.

The End World.

A ray of light suddenly appeared here.

At this moment, everyone in the End World was shocked.

Yang Ye looked down at Snowy, “Lock down this place! Don’t let any information be sent out!”

Snowy nodded and waved her paws. She seemed to have thought of something at this point and quickly withdrew the Sprite Staff… A moment later, the spirit energy in the entire End World was sucked away, and her Sprite Domain enveloped the entire End World!

Anything that relied on spirit energy to be transmitted wouldn’t work here!

Yang Ye walked slowly toward the distance and laughed fiercely, “Weren’t all of you looking for me? I’m Yang Ye! Tremble before me!”
