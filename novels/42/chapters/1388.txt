Chapter 1389 – Be Careful! He’s From The Large World!

At this point in the battle, Yang Ye’s rage had arrived at a breaking point.

There were always more coming to replace the dead, and the groups that arrived here were growing larger and stronger. Now, even a Deity had arrived.

There was no end to it!

Ferocity surged through Yang Ye’s eyes, and he was about to execute the Stellar Ward technique. However, a ray of light shot out from deep within outer space, and it instantly arrived in the sky above the Radiant Dimension before slamming against the dark red palm.

Bang!

The dark red palm shattered into bits of energy that rained down from the sky, and it only took an instant for a wave of mysterious energy to obliterate the bits of energy.

Everyone here was shocked.

Who lent me a hand from so far away? Yang Ye had a trace of bewilderment in his eyes. He turned to look at the pig-riding young woman. The latter pondered deeply for a moment and said, “Third Sister!”

Blind Maiden! A wisp of excitement flashed through Yang Ye’s eyes, and then he turned to look at Jin Xiu and the others, “Perhaps you can still escape if you leave now. Otherwise, you won’t have a chance soon.”

Needless to say, they did feel a trace of fear right now. That person who’d lent Yang Ye a hand earlier was definitely not someone they could resist.

The Nether Pavilion had experts too, and it was even a supreme expert comparable to a Deity. Obviously, if that person acted against them, then they would definitely die.

“There’s no need to fear them!” Suddenly, a voice resounded, and then a black robed figure appeared not too far in front of Yang Ye.

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly. The black robed figure was the same one that Nether Maiden had been fighting. Yang Ye turned around and saw Nether Maiden had appeared by his side.

Nether Maiden spoke solemnly, “Be careful! He’s from the large world!”

The large world! Yang Ye was slightly shocked. He hadn’t expected that the black robed figure had actually come down here from the large world. In other words, the large world had started to act itself.

Meanwhile, the black robed figure said, “There’s no need to worry, there naturally are others to deal with the experts of the Nether Pavilion. You’ll get 5 permits if you kill a hall master of the Nether Pavilion. Moreover, once you enter the large world, you can use their heads to directly enter a Violetgold Rank power in the large world.”

A Violetgold Rank power!

Lian Suyao and the others were visibly moved. The strongest power in the lower dimensions was at the Titanium Rank, and only the large world had Violetgold Rank powers. What did such a power represent?

It represented backing and resources.

No matter how outstanding one’s natural talent was, it would be difficult for one to grow without the fostering of a power. Because cultivating didn’t just require natural talent, it required resources as well. No matter how great one’s natural talent was, one’s accomplishments would be limited without resources. Because having no one to foster and support you meant that you would have to waste a lot of time on earning energy stones and other trivial matters.

Moreover, if they had a sect to support and foster them, then they would just have to cultivate. Because the sect would resolve everything else. Besides that, the sect would be there to back them up if they get into trouble! So, it was obvious how important powerful backing was. Of course, it wasn’t absolute. Many independent cultivators were extremely formidable. But in the opinions of most, having the backing of a sect was the best.

Because it was common knowledge that independent cultivators suffered through their lives.

Meanwhile, Lian Suyao suddenly asked, “Why should we believe you?!”

“I’m from the large world!” The black robed figure said, “We published that assignment which all of you’ve accepted. If you return to Stellar City now, you’ll know that I’m not lying. Because the compensation has changed.”

Lian Suyao spoke in a low voice, “There’s something I don’t understand. Since your large world wants Yang Ye and the Nether Pavilion’s experts’ lives, then why doesn’t it send supreme experts itself? I think that if you send your supreme experts, both Yang Ye and the Nether Pavilion will have no chance of surviving, right?”

Yang Ye gazed at the black robed figure as well because he too wanted to know the answer.

The large world’s experts weren’t fools, so they naturally wouldn’t do something like sending nobodies to give their enemies experience. However, the large world hadn’t just sent countless Deity Realm experts here. Just as Lian Suyao had said, if it really did send its experts, then he and the Nether Pavilion would really be in danger. After all, those powers would definitely have no lack of Deities.

However, they hadn’t done so. Conversely, they published such an assignment and made the experts of the lower dimensions come to kill them. Yang Ye was quite puzzled by this.

“Let me answer that!” Meanwhile, the pig-riding young woman suddenly said, “Because there’s a restriction. Anyone at the Deity Realm or above from the large world will have their cultivations restricted by the Supreme Heaven Dao when they descend to the lower dimensions. They would be suppressed to a lower realm.”

“Why?” It was Yang Ye who asked this question.

“Balance!” The pig-riding young woman spoke indifferently, “It’s like raising pigs. If you raise pigs, would you allow a tiger into the pigsty?”

Yang Ye’s face darkened, “What kind of analogy is that?”

She shrugged, “Those are the facts. However, you’re far from able to understand what I’ve just said. But you’ll understand in the future.”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

She added, “We chose to come down here because of the restriction placed on them by the Supreme Heaven Dao. That was also why they didn’t send down all their experts to annihilate us. So, they published that assignment with the intent of using these fellows to kill us. Understand?”

Yang Ye nodded. So their cultivation will be restricted if they come down here! But it does make sense. The lower dimensions would be eternally enslaved if they could come down here without any restraint, and we would have no chance to develop. With this restriction, the lower dimensions have space and the opportunity to grow. Only then can this world not fall into the hands of just a single power!Even though he didn’t have a good impression of the Eye of the Heaven Dao because it always wanted to kill him, Yang Ye had to admit that he really approved of the Heaven Dao’s restriction. Because if the restriction didn’t exist, then he wouldn’t have to face these people but a group of experts above the Deity Realm.

Yet now, he didn’t have to fear Deities even if they came down here! Because Blind Maiden was here. Deities were no threat to her! However, they still couldn’t be underestimated. Because when numbers arrived at a certain level, numbers could make up for the lack in quality. Moreover, besides the Deities of the large world, the lower dimensions had many Deities that were eyeing their heads.

So, the pressure Blind Maiden experienced was very great. Because she had to stop all the Deities!

As for those below the Deity Realm, they had no choice but to deal with them.

Meanwhile, the black robed figure suddenly said, “Everyone, I know that you’re worried about Yang Ye. So how about you leave him to me. All of you can deal with the other two.”

Lian Suyao and the others exchanged glances and were quite hesitant.

The black robed figure added, “There are no gains without pain. The permits are an opportunity to all of you, an opportunity to enter the large world. I presume that all of you don’t want to just give up. Of course, it’s fine even if you do give up. If I’m not wrong, the monstrous geniuses and experts of countless other worlds are rushing over here as we speak.”

Lian Suyao and Jin Xiu exchanged glances. In the end, Lian Suyao said, “You’ll deal with Yang Ye?”

The black robed figure replied, “I will!”

The hesitance in their eyes was instantly transformed into resolve. They didn’t speak another word and just charged at Nether Maiden and the pig-riding young woman.

Now that Yang Ye wasn’t a threat to them, they had nothing else to worry about. So, they’d attacked decisively.

Nether Maiden and the pig-riding young woman didn’t waste their breaths. Both of them shot towards Lian Suyao, Jin Xiu, and the others.

The battle erupted!

The black robed man said, “You’ve offended the Divine Phoenix Clan!”

Yang Ye asked, “It was the Divine Phoenix Clan that published the assignment to kill me, right?”

“Yes!” The black robed figure continued, “I’m really quite curious. How did someone from the lower dimensions like you actually offend the Divine Phoenix Clan? However, that isn’t important because it has nothing to do with me. How about we do this? I’ll spare you if you choose to leave right now.”

Yang Ye smiled, “What if I refuse?”

The black robed figure replied, “It wasn’t easy to cultivate to your current realm of cultivation. So, why give your life away?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “There are many occasions and many things that I have to do even if I might die.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye put both the ancient sheath and Sword Precursor away, and Heaven’s Gravestone appeared in his grasp. He’d used all the profound energy within him to repair his body while they were talking earlier. At this moment, his body had recovered slightly, but he didn’t have any profound energy. Now, he could only rely on his physical strength!

His physical strength was sufficient to put up a fight!

“Since it’s like that, then let me take you head and gain a favor from the Divine Phoenix Clan!” As soon as the black robed figure’s voice finished resounding, his figure vanished on the spot. He was in front of Yang Ye when his figure appeared once more. At the same time, countless strands of black energy shot towards Yang Ye like a dense swarm of tiny snakes.

Yang Ye slowly closed his eyes. When the black energy arrived just a few dozen centimeters away from him, Yang Ye’s sword stabbed forward swiftly.

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!

In an instant, all the black energy around Yang Ye had vanished.

The black robed man who was just about to attack had stopped moving, and a breath of time passed before he spoke solemnly, “The ability to destroy all things with a single swing of the sword!”

He’d naturally heard of this ability, but he’d never witnessed it for himself. The truly strong sword cultivators were extremely terrifying. Not to mention anything else, just this ability was a huge headache for others.

Regardless of what technique or move one used, they would be destroyed with a single swing of the sword! Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“Let me see exactly how strong that legendary ability is!” As soon as he finished speaking, his figure transformed into a ray of black light that shot explosively towards Yang Ye.
