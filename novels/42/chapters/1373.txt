Chapter 1374 – It Should Be A Deity Next!

There were 3 old men in the sky above White Deer Dimension.

All of them were Semi-Deities!

Yang Ye stood in front of them. His face was simply cold as ice while the desire to kill he revealed was seemingly material. Yang Ye naturally wanted to kill now. After all, he’d been interrupted at the crucial moment. Any man would want to kill if that happened to them!

The old man, in a luxurious robe, who led the group gazed at Yang Ye and said, “You’re Yang Ye!”

“Fuck you!” As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye drew his sword and swung it.

Om!

A sword howl resounded as a ray of sword energy surged out from the ancient sheath, and it shot towards the old man.

The expressions of all 3 old men changed. They hadn’t expected Yang Ye to just attack immediately. After all, that wasn’t what normally happened!

It only took an instant for their faces to turn gloomy. Isn’t he a little too haughty?

But it didn’t take long for the expressions on their faces to change once more. Because they’d sensed the energy carried within Yang Ye’s sword energy.

They were shocked!

Their reaction wasn’t slow at all. Three terrifying auras immediately surged out from within them and slammed down towards the sword energy. At the same time, they attacked in unison. Two energy fists and one energy palm followed behind their auras and slammed towards Yang Ye’s sword energy.

Hiss!

The auras were instantly torn apart when they came into contact with the sword energy, and the sword energy didn’t slow down at all as it slammed straight towards the energy fists and energy palm.

Bang!

The energy fists and palm were instantly blasted into bits, but the sword energy wasn’t dispersed. It merely dimmed down slightly and stopped momentarily before continuing forward towards the old men.

The old men weren’t shocked by this anymore, they were astounded. While they knew Yang Ye could kill Semi-Deities, they hadn’t expected his strength to be at such a level. They didn’t dare act carelessly at all and hurriedly attacked once more.

Bang!

Another explosion resounded through the sky, and then an old man was blasted away. The old man flew for over 5km before his figure suddenly exploded apart and transformed into bits of flesh and blood.

The remaining old men revealed extremely unsightly expressions on their faces when they witnessed this scene. Besides that, there was solemness and a trace of fear on their faces.

They hadn’t expected that their joint forces wouldn’t be able to stop Yang Ye’s attack!

It was too strong and capable of killing anyone it targeted!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye looked at the remaining old men. Their eyelids twitched at the sight of this, and their eyes were filled with fear.

Surprisingly, Yang Ye didn’t launch another attack. He naturally wouldn’t. After all, he’d executed the true form of Heavenrend earlier, and it had exhausted around half of his profound energy. He’d immediately withdrawn divine crystals and swallowed them upon executing the attack. Even though his profound energy was recovering at quite a slow pace, it was better than nothing to him!

Yang Ye glanced at them and spoke indifferently, “You were looking for me?”

The old men were at a loss for words.

Yang Ye said, “If you came looking for me, then be frank! How would I know what you want if you don’t say anything?”

The old man exchanged glances, and then the old man in a black robe spoke in a low voice, “Yang Ye, we allowed you to live that day, yet you show no gratitude, and you’ve actually returned here, destroyed the Eye of the Heaven Dao, and killed our experts. Yang Ye, do you realize that your actions are equivalent to a declaration of war to our Alliance of Guardians?!”

“You allowed me to live?” Yang Ye chuckled, “No one’s a fool here, so don’t try to play such tricks, alright? If it wasn’t for the help of my friend, I would have died a long time ago, right? Besides that, your alliance promised not to lay a hand on White Deer Academy for three years, but what was the outcome of that? You’ve been ceaselessly sending the forces of the Radiant Dimension to attack it throughout the last year. Don’t tell me that it wasn’t your alliance which suggested they took such action.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye shrugged and added, “So, don’t spout nonsense to me. Just tell me why you’re here.”

Why are we here? Their expressions became quite unnatural. They were naturally here to kill Yang Ye, but Yang Ye hadn’t even said a word once they met and instantly killed a companion of theirs.

So, how would they kill him now?

The old men remained silent. There were only 2 choices before them. The first was to attack, and the second was to retreat and get a Deity. They exchanged glances, nodded, and didn’t speak a single word. They just shot up into the sky.

They’d chosen to leave!

Based on the brief collision they had with Yang Ye just now, they knew that Yang Ye wasn’t someone whom a Semi-Deity could kill. Even their joint forces hadn’t been able to stop Yang Ye’s attack. Now only 2 of them were left here, so how could they resist it? Even though they were very well aware that Yang Ye was absolutely incapable of executing such a formidable technique without restraint, who knew how many times he could execute it? Even if Yang Ye could only execute it 2 more times, both of them would have to leave their lives here.

So, they’d decisively chosen to retreat!

Om!

Right when they retreated, another sword howl resounded from the ground below, and then a ray of sword energy shot up into the sky.

One of the old men’s figures stiffened on the spot, and then his body was split apart from the center. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

The other old man instantly turned ghastly pale at the sight of this. The profound energy within him surged madly, and then he used all his strength to flee through space. He was so swift that it only took an instant for him to vanish from the Radiant Dimension. If he turned around and looked, he would have noticed that Yang Ye had collapsed to the ground.

His strength and profound energy were both exhausted!

After executing 2 Heavenrends in succession, Yang Ye’s physical strength and profound energy were severely exhausted. He was completely without any strength left, and his body was even filled with a feeling of emptiness. It was because he’d exhausted all his profound energy.

At the moment Yang Ye’s figure fell to the ground, Xiao Bieli and Xiao Yuxi had immediately arrived by Yang Ye’s side. Xiao Yuxi hurriedly embraced Yang Ye. She didn’t speak a single word and just held him in her trembling arms. She’d watched Yang Ye execute that technique once, and the state Yang Ye was in when he suffered the backlash from it was absolutely horrifying.

But it was comparatively better now. Yang Ye had just exhausted his strength and profound energy. He’d merely lost the ability to battle and was completely fine.

Xiao Bieli hurriedly asked, “Are you alright?” Yang Ye could be considered as the hope of the entire academy right now. If anything were to happen to Yang Ye, then White Deer Academy could practically just wait for death.

Yang Ye shook his head slightly. Actually, he’d hesitated on whether he should kill that Semi-Deity. He had been quite hesitant, but when he saw them chose to flee without putting up a fight, he’d decisively chosen to kill one. Even though he was very well aware that it was quite risky, he still hadn’t hesitated to do that.

He didn’t know how strong the Alliance of Guardians actually was. But he knew that it definitely didn’t have many experts at the Semi-Deity Realm or above. So, every single one he killed was one less they had left, and the pressure he faced when he truly went to war with them in the future would be reduced.

However, he was well aware that it was very risky. Because he could only execute the true form of Heavenrend twice. If the last Semi-Deity didn’t choose to flee and chose to fight instead, then he would be in huge trouble!

But he’d taken the gamble.

Earlier, he’d been gambling that the last Semi-Deity wouldn’t dare to fight him once he attacked. After all, he’d killed a Semi-Deity with a single swing of his sword, and it had cracked open the mental defenses of the other 2 old men, causing them to arouse the thought that Yang Ye wasn’t one who could be defeated by Semi-Deities. Thus, they’d chosen to flee. Once he killed the second old man, the last old man’s mental defenses collapsed completely.

At that time, the old man would probably not have even dared to think about fighting Yang Ye.

He’d made the right bet because the old man really hadn’t dared to think about it and just fled.

He’d killed 2 more Semi-Deities from the Alliance of Guardians!

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly as he looked up into the sky, “It should be a Deity that comes next!”

...

In Yang Ye’s room.

Yang Ye laid on the bed while the room was filled with burning divine crystals, and countless strands of spirit energy surged madly towards Yang Ye. At this moment, Yang Ye’s body was like land that had experienced severe drought and finally experienced a long awaited rain. Once the spirit energy entered his body, they were swiftly absorbed, and then his body started to gradually recover.

Xiao Yuxi was by Yang Ye’s side. She didn’t speak and just sat by his bed while staring fixedly at Yang Ye.

Time passed slowly. On the second day, Yang Ye’s countenance had returned to normal, and even his body had recovered completely.

The recuperative abilities of Primordial Violet Energy was as formidable as always!

Yang Ye slowly opened his eyes, and the first thing he saw was Xiao Yuxi. He knew that she’d been by his side all the time.

Xiao Yuxi spoke softly, “You’re awake?”

Yang Ye nodded, and then he stretched out his hand and took her hand, “Don’t be too worried next time. I’m very tenacious.”

She nodded slightly, “Alright!”

Yang Ye smiled, “You still aren’t really fond of speaking!”

“You don’t like it?” She continued, “If you don’t, then I’ll speak more from now on.”

He shook his head, “So long as it’s part of you, then I like everything.”

She glanced at him and fell silent again.

Yang Ye gazed at her for a short while and spoke softly, “Yuxi, let’s have a child.”

Xiao Yuxi blushed slightly. She naturally understood what those words represented.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye didn’t waste his breath and just took her in his arms. At the same time, a strand of sword intent enveloped the entire room.

“Mmm....” It didn’t take long for soft moans to resound throughout the room. They were sometimes soft, sometimes heavy, and they sounded like a pleasant and beautiful melody.
