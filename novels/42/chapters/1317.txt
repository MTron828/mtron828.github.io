Chapter 1318 – Fight! Just Fight!

Bang!

A strand of terrifying sword intent appeared, and then the Voiders that were charging at Yang Ye were instantly blasted away by it. As for the other Voiders in the surroundings, they were pushed backwards repeatedly, and they only stopped after moving over 1km away.

All of them were shocked, including Nie Tian. Because the sword intent was clearly not sword intent above the Void Rank, it was even greater than that!

“It’s the Sword God’s Seal, it can improve sword intent!” Meanwhile, an expert of the Nie Clan stared fixedly at the Sword God’s Seal on Yang Ye’s forehead, and his hand was trembling.

The expressions of the others here had instantly changed as well.

The Sword God’s Seal!

They’d naturally heard of it in the past. It was considered the number one Void Rank treasure on Dark Hell Continent! If it was in the hands of others, it wouldn’t be really useful, but if it was in the hands of a sword cultivator, it would definitely be a divine weapon! The Sword God’s Seal could improve sword intent, and Yang Ye possessed sword intent above the Void Rank. Now that it had been improved further....

As soon as they thought of this, the expressions of the experts from the Nie Clan and Senior Yuan’s group became extremely unsightly.

If it was just sword intent above the Void Rank, then while it would be a threat to them, it would only be a threat. Yet now, Yang Ye’s sword intent could completely suppress them.

Yang Ye paid no attention to Senior Yuan and the others. He gazed at Qian Lankong and said, “Take all the members of Slayer Pavilion to Dark Hell Continent.”

Actually, he’d intended to feign compliance with the Nie Clan, and then think of a way to leave Heaven Pillar Peak. The Nie Clan’s scheme was the Nie Clan’s problem. Moreover, it was against the demon race. So, he just wanted to lead the experts of Slayer Pavilion away and not interfere in the business of the Nie Clan and demon race!

But he hadn’t expected the Nie Clan to actually join forces with Senior Yuan’s group to kill the experts of Slayer Pavilion. If he was just a little later, then Qian Lankong and Shui Linlang would have definitely died! This allowed Yang Ye to understand that the Nie Clan wasn’t just acting against the demon race, it was acting against him as well. Since the Nie Clan had started to act against him, then why should he hold back? Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

At this moment, he didn’t want to continue pretending and playing games with the Nie Clan.

Fight!

Just fight!

A swing of the sword was much more effective than any games.

Qian Lankong didn’t hesitate to immediately lead the experts of Slayer Pavilion away with Shui Linlang. At a time like this, she would naturally not say things like if they were going to leave, then they should leave together. She was no fool. Even though both Shui Linlang and her were Voiders, they would only be a burden to Yang Ye if they stayed.

“What a joke!” Meanwhile, one of the Voiders from the Nie Clan stepped forward and shouted angrily, “What do you think Heaven Pillar Peak is? You think you can just come and go as you wish...?”

The Voider’s voice stopped abruptly because Yang Ye had suddenly appeared before him. At the same time, a sword had stabbed into that Voider’s forehead. He had a dazed expression in his eyes as he gazed at Yang Ye, “How....”

He hadn’t even finished speaking when Yang Ye pulled his sword out.

Hiss!

A string of blood sprayed from that Voider’s forehead, and then Yang Ye waved his right hand and put the corpse away.

“How dare you!” Nie Tian and the others were furious. They were about to attack, but Yang Ye suddenly sheathed his sword and drew it swiftly.

Om!

A sword howl tore through the sky, and then a crescent shaped wave of sword energy swept forward.

“Watch out!” Nie Tian was horrified when he saw the sword energy, and he hurriedly warned the others. At the same time, he quickly emanated his aura. He wasn’t the only one to react like that, the others by his side had hurriedly done the same to stop the sword energy.

Bang!

As soon as the auras of 12 Voiders collided with Yang Ye’s sword energy, a rumbling explosion resounded. At this moment, the entire mountain below them trembled slightly. After that, Lin Qian and the others watched with astonishment as Nie Tian’s group was actually blasted almost 300m back!

He’d blasted 12 Voiders back with a single swing of the sword!

Lin Qian and the others gasped. Because Yang Ye’s strength was actually terrifying to such a degree! At this moment, no one here was a match for Yang Ye in single combat, including Nie Tian. If they engaged in single combat, Nie Tian would probably be unable to resist even 10 swings of Yang Ye’s sword. As for the others, they would probably be unable to even resist one swing of Yang Ye’s sword!

Lin Qian glanced at Nie Tian’s group, and then he shook his head. Because the Nie Clan’s actions were clearly extremely foolish. They’d actually tacitly approved of Senior Yuan’s attack on the Slayer Pavilion. Was Yang Ye someone they could just bully? But he was very well aware that the Nie Clan had probably not expected Yang Ye to be such a madman.

According to the Nie Clan’s thought, it was their territory, so even if the experts of the Slayer Pavilion were killed, Yang Ye would have no choice but to swallow his anger and even depend on the Nie Clan. Because Yang Ye would be all alone then. If Yang Ye didn’t depend on the Nie Clan, then he would be no match for Senior Yuan’s group. Similarly, Senior Yuan’s group would have to depend on the Nie Clan because they wouldn’t have been able to kill the Voiders of Slayer Pavilion without the Nie Clan’s tacit approval.

In short, it was the Nie Clan’s strategy to level the playing field. However, they’d clearly underestimated Yang Ye’s temper. Yang Ye was a madman, a madman who possessed formidable strength and dared to do anything. It could be said that the Nie Clan had bitten off more than it could chew.

Meanwhile, the experts of the Nie Clan were astounded when Yang Ye’s attack pushed them back. Obviously, they hadn’t expected Yang Ye’s strength to actually be this terrifying!

After he pushed them back, Yang Ye didn’t follow up with another attack, and he gazed at Lin Qian and the others instead, “Everyone, it’s inadvisable to stay here. I advise all of you to leave.”

The master of the Sky Wave Sect frowned, “What are you trying to say?!”

Yang Ye was about to speak when Nie Tian suddenly roared with fury, “Yang Ye, what’re you trying to do?! Do you realize that the demon race is eying us with hostility right now? If they leave, then Heaven Pillar Peak will definitely be lost. At that time, the entire continent will....”

Yang Ye interrupted Nie Tian and said, “Stop with all those high-sounding sentiments. You know very well what your Nie Clan is trying to achieve.” As he spoke, he gazed at Lin Qian and the others, “Everyone, the Nie Clan said that the demon race wants to attack the human race. But I’m sure you’ve seen the situation. Is it the human race that’s attacking the demon race, or is it the demon race that’s attacking the human race?”

Lin Qian and the others’ faces fell. They’d felt that the situation was quite off because the demon race had never shown any signs of attacking since they’d arrived on Heaven Pillar Peak. On the contrary, it was the Nie Clan that launched the first attack. As for what the Nie Clan said about striking first to gain the advantage, they felt that such a reason was truly too far-fetched!

Meanwhile, Old Man Shui from the Sky Wave Sect spoke solemnly, “Yang Ye, have you found out something?”

A wisp of ridicule curled up on the corners of Yang Ye’s mouth, “All I know is that the Nie Clan hasn’t hesitated to drag the entire human race down just for its own selfish desires.”

“What nonsense!” Nie Tian spoke coldly, “Yang Ye! Don’t even try to instill suspicion in them. My Nie Clan has protected Heaven Pillar Peak for thousands of years. If it wasn’t for our Nie Clan, the human race would have been annihilated a long time ago. Now, my Nie Clan is similarly standing on the front line when the demon race intends to attack the human race. But as a member of the human race, you, Yang Ye, don’t just refuse to protect the human race, you’re even trying to slander my Nie Clan! You deserve death!”

Meanwhile, Senior Yuan said, “Everyone, I think it’s very likely that Yang Ye has defected to the demon race’s side, and he’s doing this so that we’ll collapse from internal strife. Just take a look. The demon race still hasn’t attacked until now, and it’s definitely because they are waiting for our human race to fall into internal strife.”

When he spoke up to this point, his voice grew louder, and he pointed at Yang Ye and said, “He has betrayed the human race!”

The others immediately frowned when they heard this. Actually, Nie Tian and Senior Yuan did make sense.

Meanwhile, Old Man Shui stepped forward and said, “Everyone, no matter what it is, we’re all part of the human race. The demon race is about to strike, so we really shouldn’t continue engaging in internal strife. What happened earlier really was a misunderstanding, and it’s really not necessary to fight to the death for a misunderstanding. Why don’t we sit down and talk about it? We’re all part of the human race, so there is nothing we can’t overcome!”

“Talk about it?” Nie Tian spoke coldly, “He killed a Voider of my Nie Clan. There’s nothing to talk about now.”

He hadn’t attacked because he was very well aware that Yang Ye had utilized a treasure to forcefully improve his sword intent, and it was only temporary. So, he could wait until Yang Ye returned to normal. So long as Yang Ye’s sword intent returned to normal, Yang Ye would definitely suffer backlash. At that time, it would be absolutely effortless to kill Yang Ye.

Yang Ye glanced at Old Man Shui and the others, “That’s all I’ll say. What you decide is your business.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye didn’t waste his breath and shot up into the sky.

Actually, he’d guessed the outcome from the beginning. They would definitely not believe him. After all, when compared to the demon race, they would be more willing to believe the Nie Clan. Moreover, some of them might even be thinking that he was sowing discord amongst them and the Nie Clan so that he could take advantage of the situation. There were even many who might think that he’d really sided with the demon race!

It was an arduous and thankless task!

He’d said what he should. Just as he’d said, their decision was their business.

When he saw Yang Ye leave, Nie Tian hurriedly said, “Stop him! Don’t let him escape! It’ll only take a while for him to start suffering from backlash!”

As soon as he finished speaking, his figure shot towards Yang Ye. After that, the experts of the Nie Clan and Senior Yuan’s group hurriedly followed after him.

Yang Ye had improved his sword intent by force, so it would definitely make him suffer backlash. Thus, it was the best opportunity to kill Yang Ye. How could they let such an opportunity slip by?

Lin Qian and the others exchanged glances, and they were at a loss for what to do.

A short while passed before Lin Qian shook his head, “The Nie Clan kept telling us not to engage in internal strife, but they are the ones who started it.... Alas....”

...

Qian Lankong and the others dashed swiftly all along the way. They had to leave the Veiled Region as soon as possible, and then head to Doomsday City.

A long while later, the space around them suddenly trembled, and then Zi’er appeared before them, “The exit isn’t too far away. Head there yourselves, I’m going back for him.” She would absolutely not leave Yang Ye behind.

Suddenly, an old man walked out from a distant expanse of space, “You’re going back? There’s no need for that. I’ll send all of you off.”

Qian Lankong and the others’ expressions changed drastically at the sight of the old man.

“All of you go on ahead!” Zi’er pressed her palms together and pulled them apart, and then a huge spatial rift appeared in front of Qian Lankong’s group. Suddenly, the old man took a step forward and instantly arrived in front of Zi’er, “You’re that fellow, Yang Ye’s, woman, right? You truly deserve a beating.” As soon as he finished speaking, he swung his palm at Zi’er’s face.

Zi’er’s pupils constricted. She wanted to dodge, but she noticed to her horror that her speed had actually become extremely slow!

Slap!

A clear and resounding slap resounded. Zi’er spat out a few mouthfuls of blood, and then she crashed to the ground.
