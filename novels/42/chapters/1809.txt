Chapter 1810 – A Collision Of Paths!

It was a woman standing in front of Yang Ye.

He recognized her. It was the Secret Sect’s Yun Qian.

Yang Ye hadn’t expected to meet her here, and he hadn’t expected her to suddenly attack her.

Yun Qian sized up Yang Ye, “Who are you?”

Yang Ye’s voice had been changed, so she didn’t know that it was Yang Ye.

Yang Ye glanced at her and replied, “Why did you attack me?”

Yun Qian replied, “You’ve broken the rules!”

“The rules?” Yang Ye frowned, “What rules?”

Yun Qian asked, “Is this your first time here?”

Yang Ye nodded.

She glanced at him and said, “This place is called Crimson Plains, and Heaven Pillar Mountain is behind it. Heaven Pillar Mountain is extremely dangerous, so besides those extremely old seniors, others aren’t able to survive there. So, Crimson Plains is where we, comparatively weaker sects and people, reside.”

She paused for a moment and continued, “This area belongs to my Secret Sect, and you’ve trespassed into our territory.”

Yang Ye looked up. The area ahead was completely empty. But it didn’t take long for him to notice something odd. The space there was slightly odd.

It was a formation!

A formation covered the area there, but it was difficult to notice from the outside.

Meanwhile, Yun Qian suddenly asked, “You recognize me?”

Yang Ye glanced at her and asked, “The Secret Sect is here too?”

Yun Qian spoke coldly, “Who are you?!”

Yang Ye shook his head and walked off in another direction.

He naturally didn’t have a good impression of the Secret Sect, or it should be said that he wanted to annihilate it. The Secret Sect had schemed against him, and he’d never forgotten that. If it wasn’t for the Primordial Pagoda, he would be dead by now.

However, he knew that it wasn’t the time to look for trouble with the Secret Sect.

It didn’t take long for Yang Ye to vanish from her field of vision.

Meanwhile, an old man appeared by her side, “Who was that?”

She shook her head, “I don’t know. But he felt familiar.”

The old man glanced into the distance and said, “This place is extremely dangerous. Be careful.”

Yun Qian nodded, and then she seemed to have thought of something and gazed at the old man, “Elder Yun, are the sect master and the others going to the large universe?”

The old man nodded, “The sect master and three other elders have arrived at their own respective bottlenecks. Heading to the large universe is the only way for them to advance quickly. So, they’ve decided to join forces and try!”

He gazed at Yun Qian and continued, “The reason the sect master brought all of you here is because he hopes to let all of you witness the true experts of this world. At the same time, he wishes to temper all of you. Because the Secret Sect’s future is in your hands!”

Yun Qian fell silent for a short while before she said, “Elder Yun, what happened between our sect and Yang Ye?”

The old man shook his head, “Only the sect master and the others are aware.”

Yun Qian nodded and didn’t speak further.

The old man vanished on the spot once he finished speaking, “Let’s go!”

Yun Qian looked up in the direction that Yang Ye had vanished towards, and then she turned around and vanished on the spot.

…

Yang Ye didn’t head to Heaven Pillar Mountain immediately. He found an empty area and sat down cross-legged.

Cultivation!

As far as he was concerned, the important matter at hand was to improve his strength as quickly as possible.

He was like a juicy piece of meat right now, and everyone wanted a bite. It was obvious that once his presence was exposed, countless would come for him. Besides that, he wanted to go to the large universe as well.

He’d never forgotten about Xiao Qi!

He had to send her home!

But because of the Primordial Pagoda, he knew that even though he’d never been there, he would definitely encounter even more numerous and terrifying trouble upon arriving in the large universe.

Since he started cultivating, his life was bound to not be a peaceful one.

If he wasn’t strong enough, he would die!

Cultivation!

Yang Ye intended to cultivate to improve his realm of cultivation. He was just at the 1st stage of the True Realm, and it wasn’t really enough for him right now. Especially when facing those true experts, he was always worried that his profound energy would dry up.

Even though his body was extremely strong, his strength would be reduced tremendously without sufficient profound energy!

Improving his realm of cultivation was obviously extremely difficult. Especially after arriving at the True Realm. It required so much spirit energy to be improved. Moreover, it couldn’t be ordinary spirit energy. The reason there were no experts above the Rebirth Realm in Merak System was that it didn’t have better spirit energy.

Similarly, besides seeking an even better system of cultivation, the reason the experts of the medium universe wanted to enter the large universe was because they were pursuing even better spirit energy.

Any other True Realm expert would find it very difficult to advance, and it would take a lot of time. However, it wasn’t very difficult for Yang Ye. Because he possessed sufficient spirit energy, and it was naturally from Snowy and the Spirit Pearl.

Besides that, it was because the quality of his profound energy was superb!

Based on his estimations, he didn’t have to go to the large universe and would still be able to rise above the 6th stage of the True Realm!

Of course, it couldn’t be accomplished in a short amount of time! 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Yang Ye summoned Snowy to the cultivation room. Her eyes lit up once she found out that Yang Ye needed her help, and excitement filled her eyes. A moment later, seemingly material spirit energy filled the room.

Snowy blinked as she watched Yang Ye sit cross-legged and cultivate, and then she flashed over to his shoulder. After that, she placed her claws over her stomach just like Yang Ye did, and then she opened her mouth and started to suck in the spirit energy!

Cultivate!

She wanted to cultivate too!

Just like that, both of them started to cultivate.

On the 1st level of the Primordial Pagoda.

Hou Qing suddenly appeared before Qiong Qi. The latter glanced at Hou Qing and remained silent.

Meanwhile, Hou Qing said, “Qiong Qi, I realized something lately. Tell me, why did that person choose this kid as his successor?”

Qiong Qi frowned slightly, “What do you mean?”

Hou Qing replied, “This pagoda is that person’s main treasure. Even if he doesn’t need it anymore, he should give it to those personal disciples of his. However, he didn’t, and he gave it to this kid. Don’t you think it’s strange?”

Qiong Qi replied, “The Sovereign of Sky’s daughter stole the pagoda. It fell into his hands by chance.”

“Nonsense!” Hou Qing grunted coldly, “If he wasn’t satisfied with this kid, this kid would be dead by now. But the pagoda is helping him. Obviously, he has obtained that person’s acknowledgement. So, that raises a question. Why did that person choose such a mad fellow as his successor?”

Qiong Qi fell silent.

Meanwhile, Hou Qing continued, “I keep having the feeling that there’s a reason why he was chosen. But I don’t know if the reason is a scheme against my shaman race, your demon race, or the human race itself.”

He paused for a moment and continued, “I think that it’s not likely for him to target our races.”

Qiong Qi asked, “Why?”

Hou Qing replied, “Don’t forget who that person’s greatest enemy is.”

Qiong Qi’s eyes narrowed slightly, “What are you trying to say?”

Hou Qing spoke in a low voice, “A collision of paths!”

Qiong Qi’s expression became solemn.

Meanwhile, Hou Qing added, “If that’s his true objective, then this kid is in huge trouble. After all, even though all of them don’t interfere in the business of the mortal world, once they can’t restrain themselves and start colliding with the other paths, it’s fucking horrifying.”

He shook his head, “I don’t want to follow this kid. Otherwise, I wouldn’t even know how I died one day!”

Qiong Qi fell silent for a long time and said, “Even though it’s just a guess of yours, it does make sense. However, why did that person choose this fellow? There are numerous amongst his successors who are stronger and more outstanding than this kid.”

Hou Qing thought for a moment and replied, “Have you noticed? This kid is stubborn and rash. He’s the most suitable to break the existing rules, and only he would dare to do something like that.”

Qiong Qi nodded slightly, “That’s true. Actually, have you noticed that this kid isn’t ordinary as well?”

Hou Qing looked up at Qiong Qi, “You noticed too?”

Qiong Qi nodded, “I was just slightly puzzled in the past. Because I felt that it’s impossible for someone with such ability to exist here in this lower dimension. However, I confirmed my suspicions a while back.” He shook his head, “It’s getting more and more complicated.”

Hou Qing said, “Indeed. What do you plan to do about this kid?”

Qiong Qi shook his head, “I haven’t given it any thought. But this kid isn’t bad. At least he’s loyal and not a hypocrite.”

Hou Qing nodded, “Even though I wanted to kill him in the beginning, after staying with him for some time, I noticed that he really does act like a man. However, the karma around him is absolutely numerous. The reason that woman in a red dress didn’t dare to take his sword and his pagoda is because she doesn’t dare to take the karma which comes with it… Actually, she isn’t the only one, even I dare not do that.”

Qiong Qi glanced at Hou Qing, “You’ve already gotten coiled around yourself. If this kid dies, this pagoda will be without an owner, and it’ll definitely seal itself. At that time, you’ll never be able to escape.”

Hou Qing shook his head, “I was an idiot to come into this place!”

Qiong Qi was about to say something when something unexpected occurred.

Qiong Qi and Hou Qing watched with astonishment as the space there suddenly warped. At the same time, they noticed that the space around here was trembling violently.

An instant later, their eyes opened wide, and disbelief filled their eyes.

A breath of time later, Hou Qing gulped, “What the hell?”
