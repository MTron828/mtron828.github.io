Chapter 1988 – Cultivate!

Everyone gazed at Yang Ye, and it didn’t take long for a black sword to appear in his grasp.

Judgment!

Dire Wolf gazed coldly at Yang Ye while ridicule covered the corners of his mouth.

Meanwhile, A’Man walked over to Yang Ye’s side and grabbed his arm. She shook her head slightly, “He’s infuriating us on purpose so that we attack him here!”

Yang Ye nodded, “I know!”

He gazed at Dire Wolf at this point, “I know what you’re after.”

Dire Wolf laughed coldly, “And?”

“And?” Yang Ye chuckled, and his smile gradually became cold, “And I’ll fulfill your wish!”

A ray of light flashed.

Burial!

After that, the surroundings fell silent.

Dire Wolf’s eyes were opened wide and filled with disbelief. A crack gradually appeared on his forehead, and it didn’t take long for the crack to expand until his stomach.

Blood sprayed from Dire Wolf’s body.

Everyone was stunned on the spot, including Qin Chuan and the others. They knew Yang Ye was very strong, but they hadn’t expected him to be this strong.

Dire Wolf was a See Dao Realm expert! But he’d been annihilated in an instant!

“How dare you!” Suddenly, a furious shout resounded from the sky, and then the flying swords around them immediately shot towards Yang Ye’s group.

A’Man and the others were about to counterattack when Yang Ye suddenly waved his hand and stopped them. He took a step forward and glanced at the flying swords before shouting furiously, “Fuck off!”

As soon as he said that, a sword howl resounded from Judgment. In an instant, the swords stopped on the spot before flying backwards.

Meanwhile, an old man in linen clothes appeared before them.

The old man gazed coldly at Yang Ye, “Give me an explanation!”

“An explanation?” Yang Ye replied, “We want to join Southern Qilin Mountain!”

The old man asked, “That’s your reason for killing him?”

Yang Ye replied, “I killed because he deserved death.”

The old man looked Yang Ye in the eyes, “He joined Southern Qilin Mountain. So, he’s a member of ours!”

Yang Ye smiled, “We can join too!”

The old man fell silent for a short while before he said, “Not just anyone can join us!”

“Welcome!” Suddenly, a voice came from afar. They looked over and saw a young man walking over in their direction.

The old man’s expression changed slightly when he saw the young man. He was about to say something when the young man immediately went over to Yang Ye and smiled, “Welcome! I welcome you on behalf of Southern Qilin Mountain! Please come with me!”

The young man gestured for them to follow him.

Yang Ye and A’Man exchanged glances. Yang Ye was about to speak when the old man suddenly spoke solemnly, “Young Master Yu, I recruited them!” Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“Oh?” The young man chuckled, and then he gazed at Yang Ye. Yang Ye was about to speak when the old man spoke once more, “Young Brother, the Northern Faction welcomes you and your friends. As for what happened earlier, we’ll let bygones be bygones!”

Yang Ye shook his head and gazed at the young man, “We’ll go with you!”

A wisp of surprise flashed through the young man’s eyes, and then he smiled, “You’re absolutely welcome!”

“Young Brother!” Suddenly, the old man spoke in a low voice, “You should think some things through!”

Yang Ye gazed at the old man, “I think he’s better. So, we’ll join his side!”

“Of course I am, hahaha!” The young man roared with laughter and said, “Come with me!”

Just like that, they followed the young man and left swiftly.

The old man’s face was extremely gloomy.

…

As they traveled, the young man smiled, “Brother, what’s your name?”

Yang Ye replied, “Yang Ye!”

The young man smiled, “Mo Renyu! The Southern Faction of Southern Qilin Mountain!”

Yang Ye gazed at the young man with a bewildered gaze, “The Southern Faction and Northern Faction?”

The young man smiled, “This place belonged to two people before the unexpected turn of events here. One of them is the northern faction’s Wan Qianyou, and the other is my father, Mo Tianqiong. They are the strongest here. Of course, they’ve always coexisted in peace.”

Mo Renyu chuckled and continued, “However, no one expected this to happen in the Dead Dimension. So, everyone in Southern Qilin Mountain was forced to join forces, but who would be the leader? They didn’t wouldn’t be willing to accept the other as a leader. So, that’s how the northern and southern factions were formed!”

I see! Yang Ye nodded slightly. He seemed to have thought of something, and he couldn’t help but shake his head and smiled. Because they were already in such a situation, but Southern Qilin Mountain’s forces still hadn’t truly united with each other. It would be very dangerous if this went on!

“We’re here!” Mo Renyu pointed into the distance. There was a courtyard there. It wasn’t very luxurious, but it was nice.

Mo Renyu said, “This is where you’ll stay. It’s a little simple, so I hope you don’t mind!”

Yang Ye nodded, “Thank you!”

“I presume all of you went through a long fight to get here!” Mo Renyu smiled, “And you should be very tired. So, I won’t disturb you further. Farewell!”

Mo Renyu cupped his fist and left.

A’Man asked, “What do you think?”

Yang Ye shook his head slightly, “We don’t know anything about them for now. However, he does know how to deal with people. Anyway, let’s just ignore all of that for now and just see what happens. We can leave if this place isn’t good for us!”

A’Man nodded slightly, “True!”

Meanwhile, Yang Ye waved his right hand, and then two immortal crystals appeared before each of them, “Heal up first!”

They didn’t refuse it, and they just took them and left.

Meanwhile, A’Man suddenly said, “Let’s talk!”

Yang Ye glanced at her and nodded.

In Yang Ye’s room.

A’Man looked him in the eyes, “Are you from the god race?”

The god race! Yang Ye replied, “What do you mean?”

She asked, “Are you from it or not?”

Yang Ye replied with a question, “Why do you ask?”

A’Man shook her head slightly, “That demon beast which saved us. I saw it in an ancient text, and it’s the god race’s Royal Crocodile. I don’t know why there’s one here, but I know that it only helped us because of you.”

Yang Ye smiled, “I’m not from the god race!”

She asked, “Really?”

Yang Ye nodded, “I really am not. However, I really don’t understand why you’re so worried.”

“How can I not be worried?” She spoke indifferently, “Those fellows in the world outside won’t allow the god race to exist, and they’ll kill anyone from the god race that they encounter!”

Yang Ye fell silent.

Meanwhile, A’Man continued, “Don’t let anyone know about your relationship with the god race, or you’ll be in deep trouble!”

Yang Ye nodded, “I understand!”

She nodded slightly, “You must be tired! Rest well!”

She left once she finished speaking.

Only Yang Ye remained in the room.

Yang Ye sat cross-legged on the bed and frowned slightly. Based on what A’Man told him, he was able to discern that the enmity between the god race and the other races was absolutely deep!

Was it the god race who sealed this dimension?

If it was them, why?

A string of questions flashed through his mind. In the end, Yang Ye shook his head and stopped thinking about it.

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts and entered the Primordial Pagoda.

Cultivate!

The battle with the demon beasts had allowed him to sense that he was at a bottleneck, and he planned to break through it.

Even though he was extremely strong now, his cultivation was quite low, and that was disadvantageous to him. Because without a good foundation, his combat strength would still be very limited!

Just like earlier. He couldn’t swing his sword again after swinging it just now!

Besides cultivation, he had one more thing to do, and it was to make Snowy create immortal crystals! The immortal crystals he’d given away and those he’d already used were a total of a few hundred. That was all he had. But if he didn’t have more immortal crystals, it would be torture for him in this place.

It didn’t take long for Yang Ye to find Snowy.

Snowy waved her little claw. She was saying that she was tired, very tired!

Yang Ye’s face darkened, “Tell me what your conditions are!”

Snowy blinked innocently to display that she didn’t understand.

Yang Ye rubbed her head gently, “I really need immortal crystals right now, so can you help me make some? Of course, there’ll be benefits!”

Snowy’s eyes lit up when she heard that there would be benefits.

Yang Ye rubbed her head gently and smiled, “You’re getting more and more mischievous!”

Yang Ye played with Snowy for a while and returned to the cultivation room. He sat down cross-legged and started absorbing spirit energy from the surroundings like a madman.

Meditation!

Just like that, time trickled by, and his aura grew stronger and stronger.

Around two weeks later.

Yang Ye suddenly stood up. In an instant, a wave of energy swept out from him, but it only took a moment for it to vanish without a trace.

Huff!

Yang Ye let out a light breath of air and opened his eyes.

The 3rd stage of the Enlightened Realm!

He was finally at the 3rd stage of the Enlightened Realm!

Suddenly, Yang Ye frowned slightly and left the Primordial Pagoda. A voice came from outside, “Brother Yang, are you here?”

It was Yu Jing’s voice!

Yang Ye opened the door and asked, “What is it?”

Yu Jing nodded slightly, “Qin Chuan has been crippled!”

Yang Ye’s eyes instantly narrowed.
