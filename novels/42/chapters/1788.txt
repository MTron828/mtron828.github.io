Chapter 1789 – Alright! We’ll Fight One On One!

The wooden sword!

The wooden sword had been in the Secret Sect previously, so the Secret Sect didn’t dare to announce its presence to the world. Or it should be said that it didn’t want to. Because the Secret Sect could make deals with the experts in the large universe while it had the wooden sword, and it could obtain some unimaginable treasures.

Their minds had been clouded by greed!

In the end, the Secret Sect wanted to get rid of the trouble in its hands, but it was too late. Because they hadn’t expected the head to be so strong, and the wooden sword was sealed by the head instead.

Now, the head had left the Secret Sect, and the wooden sword had left with it. So, announcing its presence to the world would allow the Secret Sect to use others to kill him!

In other words, he was in big trouble!

Unless he handed over the wooden sword!

Meanwhile, the pig-riding young woman said, “Now, experts from Heaven Pillar Mountain are rushing over. Because they’ll have a higher chance of success with the wooden sword in their possession. So, it's a temptation that they cannot resist.”

Meanwhile, Yang Lianshuang said, “It’s very troublesome indeed!”

The pig-riding young woman gazed at Yang Ye, “What do you plan to do now? Hide?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “I can’t hide. Because if I do that, they’ll definitely think of ways to find me. For example, the Yang Clan. They can use the Yang Clan to threaten me.”

Yang Lianshuang said, “They won’t be able to find us in a short amount of time!”

Yang Ye asked, “But they’ll find us sooner or later, right?”

Yang Lianshuang nodded, “They’re all peerless experts, and coupled with the fact that the Ying Clan and the other clans are targeting us, they’ll be able to find us even if they use the simplest method of searching every world in the medium universe. Even though it’ll exhaust a huge amount of time and energy, it’s just a little to 6th stage True Realm experts!”

Yang Ye smiled, “So, I can’t hide! Moreover, I can hide for a while, but I can’t hide forever, right?”

The pig-riding young woman asked, “So what do you plan to do?”

A ferocious smile curled up on the corners of Yang Ye’s mouth, “I’ve always believed that only killing can put an end to killing!”

Yang Lianshuang suddenly said, “I have to remind you that they aren’t that easy to kill!”

Yang Ye spoke indifferently, “Then should I just hand the wooden sword over and beg them to let me go?”

Yang Lianshuang fell silent.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye said, “Everyone dies! I’m not afraid of them!”

As he spoke, he gazed at the two of them, “Let’s put that aside for now. I intend to make a big move!”

Yang Lianshuang gazed at Yang Ye, “What do you mean?”

Yang Ye laughed coldly, “The Ying Clan and those other clans have been chasing after me for so long. How can I just let the matter rest?”

Yang Lianshuang gazed at Yang Ye, “So?”

The cold smile on his face gradually turned ferocious, “So, I intend to pay the Ying Clan a visit!”

Yang Lianshuang nodded, “I support that idea!”

“Let’s go!” Yang Ye vanished on the spot once he finished speaking.

Zhuang Weiran, Yang Lianshuang, and the pig-riding young woman vanished on the spot with him.

…

Heaven Desolation Continent. Heaven Desolation City.

Even though Yang Ye had destroyed Heaven Desolation City in the past, it had been completely rebuilt.

However, those words Yang Ye left behind were still on its walls.

Ying Qing asked for it to be left there, and it was naturally so that the descendants of the Ying Clan would be aware of the humiliation that the Ying Clan suffered.

Noon.

Om!

Suddenly, a sword howl resounded in the sky above the city, and then a ray of sword energy descended from the sky. It was extremely swift, and it instantly shot into the city.

Boom!

The city was immediately chopped into two!

This sudden attack caused everyone in Heaven Desolation City to be shocked. Meanwhile, a voice resounded in the sky above the city, “Ying Clan! I’m back!”

At this moment, everyone looked up into the sky, and a man in a green robe had suddenly appeared there.

Yang Ye!

It was Yang Ye.

The expressions of countless became unsightly upon seeing Yang Ye.

Yang Ye was naturally not an unfamiliar face to them because it was Yang Ye who’d destroyed Heaven Desolation City a few times.

Meanwhile, over 20 powerful auras shot up into the sky, and then Ying Qing’s group appeared not too far away from Yang Ye.

At this moment, Ying Qing’s expression was extremely gloomy. He was just about to speak when Yang Ye suddenly raised his sword and swung it at the city below them.

Hiss!

A wave of sword energy tore through the air.

Boom!

Another huge ravine appeared in the city.

Yang Ye looked up at Ying Qing, “Didn’t I tell you to stop repairing it?”

Ying Qing stared at Yang Ye, fell silent for a moment, and then he vanished on the spot. At the same time, a powerful wave of aura slammed down at Yang Ye.

Yang Ye didn’t even hesitate to raise his sword and swing it.

Bang!

The aura was instantly dispersed, and Ying Qing was blasted over 1km away!

The expressions of everyone here changed when they witnessed this scene.

Ying Qing’s expression had changed too. He looked up at Yang Ye, and his eyes were filled with disbelief, “You… you’re actually this strong now?!” He knew Yang Ye had grown stronger, but he hadn’t imagined that Yang Ye would actually be this strong!

A cold smile curled up on the corners of Yang Ye’s mouth, “I’ll be back!”

His figure shot up towards the starry sky once he finished speaking.

Ying Qing was stunned, and then he said, “Don’t let him get away. Keep him busy for 100 breaths of time. The experts from the other clans will be here in 100 breaths of time!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he shot off in pursuit of Yang Ye.

The other 21 experts of the Ying Clan followed closely behind him.

In the starry sky, Yang Ye suddenly stopped. As soon as he stopped, Ying Qing’s group appeared in front of him.

Ying Qing stared at Yang Ye, “You think you can escape? You….”

Suddenly, the space before Yang Ye shook violently, and then a few women appeared in front of him.

They were Zhuang Weiran, Yang Lianshuang, the pig-riding young woman, Oblivion Maiden, Nether Maiden, Shadow Maiden, Light Maiden, Ice Maiden, Boundary Maiden, and Resentment Maiden!

All of them were at the True Realm!

Ying Qing and the others’ expressions changed at the sight of this!

It was an ambush!

“Retreat!” Ying Qing didn’t hesitate to order a retreat.

Meanwhile, the woman vanished on the spot, and then the space in a huge area shook violently. After that, an invisible barrier appeared there. Ying Qing and the others who were fleeing through space were stopped by the barrier.

But right when they were about to destroy the barrier….

“Reverse!” A soft shout resounded. In an instant, the space in the surroundings started trembling, and then Ying Qing and the others’ countenances turned pale!

The vitality within them was escaping their bodies! Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Ying Qing and the others gazed at Nether Maiden, and then Ying Qing charged at her.

“Ice Seal!” Suddenly, Ice Maiden took a step forward. In an instant, the space before her froze, and the frozen expanse of space only took an instant to expand to Ying Qing’s group. However, they were all 4th and 5th stage True Realm experts, so they would naturally not be defeated that easily. However, it had stopped them from moving further forward.

Meanwhile, the pig-riding young woman suddenly shot forward with her huge saber in hand. She transformed into a ray of light that slashed down at Ying Qing. Everywhere she passed, space was instantly sliced into bits, and a huge spatial rift appeared in her wake.

The spatial rift shook strangely before countless beams of black light erupted from it, and then they covered the surroundings as they enveloped Ying Qing’s group.

Shadow Maiden!

It was Shadow Maiden who was attacking!

Just like that, Nether Maiden and the others entered into battle with Ying Qing’s group, and Yang Ye, Yang Lianshuang, and Zhuang Weiran still hadn’t joined the battle.

Yang Lianshuang suddenly asked, “They’re all your friends?”

Yang Ye nodded, “What do you think? They’re strong, right?”

She glanced at them and nodded, “Why are all your friends female?”

Yang Ye’s face stiffened. But it didn’t take long for him to relax, and then he gazed at her, “I’m handsome! That’s a good reason, right?”

Yang Lianshuang’s eyelids twitched slightly. She was about to say something when Yang Ye suddenly spoke, “Let’s join the battle. Let’s strive to deal with them before the experts from the other clans arrive!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he transformed into a ray of light that vanished on the spot.

Meanwhile, Yang Lianshuang gazed at Zhuang Weiran, “Was his skin always this thick?”

Zhuang Weiran thought for a moment and replied, “It has never been any other way!”

She vanished on the spot once she finished speaking.

Yang Lianshuang shrugged, and then she charged at Ying Qing’s group.

Even though Yang Ye’s group only consisted of 11 experts, Ying Qing’s group was completely suppressed since the battle began!

Especially after Yang Ye joined the battle, they instantly lost three True Realm experts.

Bang!

Suddenly, an explosion resounded. In an instant, the invisible barrier in the surroundings shattered. At the same time, an old man appeared here. After that, a powerful aura instantly blasted Nether Maiden and the others 300m away!

A 6th stage True Realm expert!

Ying Yu!

It was one of the Ying Clan’s ancestors, Ying Yu!

“You’re finally here?” A cold smile curled up on the corners of Yang Ye’s mouth, “I thought you’d only show yourself after all of them are dead!”

Ying Yu’s gaze descended onto Yang Ye, “What? You want to kill me?”

Yang Ye nodded, “Can’t I?”

Ying Yu looked Yang Ye in the eyes, “Why don’t you give it a try?”

Yang Ye smiled, “One on one? The one who seeks help is the other’s grandson!”

Ying Yu nodded, “Alright! One on one!”
