Chapter 1266 – A Hit From The Veiled Region!

They naturally had no need to wait for the Imperial Oceanic Shuttle, because it seemed absolutely inferior before the Void Cloud Shuttle.

On the Void Cloud Shuttle. Yang Ye gazed at the direction of Sword God Island in silence. His gains during this trip were huge. Not only had he obtained the Sword God’s Seal and many treasures from the Sword God’s Palace; he’d even advanced to the Quasi Emperor Realm while his body advanced to the Epoch Realm. Based on his current strength, he was confident in his ability to kill a Voider even if he didn’t raise his sword intent to the Quasi Returnal Rank.

Not to mention his cultivation, just his body was comparable to a Voider Realm demon best!

He had treasures, and his strength had risen significantly. However, he hadn’t seen even a corner of the Stellar Sword Diagram. After all, the Stellar Sword Diagram might contain the method to utilize the Sword Domain!

The consciousness of the Sword God’s Seal had said that the Sword Domain could suppress all sword intent, even Returnal Rank sword intent. Obviously, the Sword Domain was stronger than sword intent. Yet now, he was like a person with a card that contained billions of violet crystals, yet he didn’t have its password. It felt quite depressing and annoying!

Fortunately, Blind Maiden seemed to know where the Stellar Sword Diagram was!

Looks like I have to look for her! Yang Ye decided. Because he didn’t want to give up on obtaining the Stellar Sword Diagram.

Meanwhile, Yun Banqing spoke abruptly, “I think you don’t have to take us to Doomsday City!”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Why?”

She replied, “Presently, no one knows that you have such a force. If the Veiled Region really attacks Doomsday City, then these forces can be used to launch a surprise attack on them. What do you think?”

Yang Ye smiled, “That’s perfect!” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

She gazed at the black ape and said, “However, Senior Hei Yuan has to reside in Doomsday City. Of course, he shouldn’t expose himself.”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and said, “Miss Yun, Senior Hei Yuan, both of you head to Doomsday City. As for Jin Li, Ye Xiao, and the others, all of you don’t have to head to Doomsday City. Just conceal yourselves and await Miss Yun’s orders!”

The black ape nodded to display his agreement. Meanwhile, Jin Li and Ye Xiao nodded as well.

Yun Banqing asked, “What about you?”

Yang Ye replied, “I’m going to rescue your mother and younger brother. Tell me where the entrance to the Veiled Region is!”

Yun Banqing was astounded, “You’re going alone?”

Yang Ye replied, “It’s best to go alone. Right, don’t ask me to take you with me. I might not be able to take care of you. Moreover, the Sword Alliance should really need help right now.”

Yun Banqing fell silent for a long time before she said, “The entrance to the Veiled Region is at the extreme north of the continent. There’s a mountain range called Pearl, and there’s a teleportation at the base of it. It’s very well hidden and requires a special crystal card to locate.” She flicked a thin piece of crystal to Yang Ye and said, “You can locate the teleportation formation with it. However, someone will confirm your identity once you enter the Veiled Region. At that time....”

Yang Ye replied, “It’s fine, I can deal with that!”

She glanced at him and said, “Be careful!” She passed a jade pendant to him and continued, “This is my jade pendant. So long as my mother sees it, she’ll trust you without reservation.” As she spoke, her face beneath her veil had blushed slightly.

Yang Ye took it and nodded, “Once you and Senior Hei Yuan get to Doomsday City, just meet Liuyun directly. She’ll make arrangements for the both of you.”

Yun Banqing asked, “That Miss Yun who’s managing Doomsday City right now?”

Yang Ye nodded.

Yun Banqing asked, “Aren’t you afraid she wouldn’t like it if you make me go help her?”

Yang Ye chuckled, “I believe that such strife wouldn’t occur between you and Liuyun, right?” Regardless of whether it was Ye Liuyun or Yun Banqing, they were extremely intelligent women, and they weren’t short-sighted people, so they would definitely not do something like fight for authority.

Yun Banqing blinked, “I dare not guarantee that!”

As soon as she finished speaking, she exchanged glances with Yang Ye and smiled.

Meanwhile, the black ape suddenly said, “Kid, why does what you just said make me feel like you’re in deep trouble?”

Yang Ye shook his head slightly, “That trouble might appear, yet it might not appear as well. However, I must prepare for the worst.”

After all, the rise of the Sword Alliance posed a threat to the Veiled Region, so they would definitely not just watch and stand by idly as the Sword Alliance grew further. Moreover, if they did attack, they would definitely attack with their full strength.

The black ape spoke in a low voice, “Kid, I feel like I’ve fallen into a trap.”

Yang Ye smiled, “Senior Hei Yuan, I’m preparing for the worst, but you can think positively. Perhaps... perhaps nothing will happen!”

“That’s impossible with you here!” The black ape shook his head. He’d gained insight into Yang Ye’s character in the last few days, and he knew that Yang Ye was definitely adept at causing trouble.

The corners of Yang Ye’s mouth twitched. Looks like his impression of me isn’t good!

The Void Cloud Shuttle was countless times faster than the Imperial Oceanic Shuttle, so it took less than 6 hours for them to arrive at the ocean outside Oceanview City.

Yang Ye said, “Let’s split up here!”

Yun Banqing nodded. She glanced at Yang Ye, hesitated for a moment, and then suddenly walked over to him and hugged him lightly, “Be careful!”

As soon as she finished speaking, she entered the Void Cloud Shuttle’s control room, and then vanished into the distance with the black ape and the others.

Yang Ye was stunned for a moment, and then he shook his head and smiled. After that, he turned to look at the huge rock by the ocean, but it was completely empty.

Yang Ye didn’t wait for Blind Maiden. His figure flashed and vanished towards the north.

He wanted to speak with Blind Maiden, but he wasn’t in a rush, and he had plenty of time to do so in the future. Now, he had to rescue Yun Banqing’s mother and younger brother first. Of course, he had another objective, and it was to take a look at the Veiled Region. He had to gain an understanding of this place that might become a formidable enemy of his!

After around 4 hours of time, Yang Ye who was traveling through space on his sword had suddenly stopped. He frowned as he glanced at the surroundings because his instinct told him that something was off.

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and intended to continue on his way. Suddenly, his expression changed. The space before him shook violently, and then a pitch black hammer instantly tore through space and shot towards him. It was extremely quick, so he didn’t have the time to dodge at all, and he had no choice but to grab his sword and swing it swiftly.

Bang!

The sword and iron hammer shook violently, and then the hammer was blasted away. As for Yang Ye, the force of the collision pushed him 10m back as well. Right when his figure stopped moving, a spear suddenly shot up from beneath the ground. It was extremely swift and instantly arrived below his feet.

2 Voiders! Yang Ye’s face became unsightly. He didn’t have the time to think carefully. He immediately flipped his figure and swiftly stabbed his sword downwards.

Bang!

The sword and spear shook violently. The spear was blasted away while Yang Ye was pushed around 10m back again. Suddenly, a spear and hammer suddenly tore through the air and instantly arrived before him.

A cold glow flashed through Yang Ye’s eyes as the ancient sheath appeared in his left grasp. Meanwhile, the sword in his right hand was instantly exchanged for Heaven’s Gravestone. He sheathed it and drew it swiftly!

Om!

Yang Ye’s sword instantly struck against the spear and hammer. All 3 weapons instantly shook violently before the sword and hammer were blasted away. Meanwhile, Yang Ye’s arm trembled as well while his figure flew backwards.

Right when his figure had just been blasted away, the space behind him trembled slightly, and then a practically translucent dagger stabbed towards his nape.

At the same time, 3 terrifying auras suddenly pressed down upon him and instantly suppressed his sword intent.

It was 3 Voiders!
