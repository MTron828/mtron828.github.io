Chapter 1089 – Are You A Dog? Why Do You Keep Barking!

Yang Ye remained silent.

Su Shihe instantly heaved a sigh of relief when he saw Yang Ye remain silent, and he said, “Yang Ye, don’t worry. So long as you’re within White Deer Academy, then I’ll guarantee all of your safety with my life!”

“Don’t listen to his nonsense!” Hao Tian spoke bluntly, “That kid is trash. He isn’t a match for Li Laoguai at all. As for the other Quasi Emperor from their Scholarly Faction, even he himself is in danger, so it’s impossible for him to protect all of you. Not only can I guarantee this little girl’s safety if she goes with me, her strength will rise immensely!”

Su Shihe was about to speak when Hao Tian suddenly glared angrily at him, “Kid, do you want to fight me in single combat? Do you?”

Su Shihe was speechless.

Hao Tian grunted coldly, and then he gazed at An Nanjing, “Little girl, you possess the Martial God Physique, so you’ll only be able to unearth your potential effectively at my Martial Sect. Moreover, my Martial Sect possesses countless resources. So long as you come to my Martial Sect, I guarantee that you’ll be able to rise to at least the top 20 on the martial Rankings within 3 years!”

Yang Ye frowned and spoke with dissatisfaction, “Only the top 20?”

“Kid!” Hao Tian continued, “Do you know how abnormal those fellows on the Martial Rankings are? Even though that fellow, Jun Hualuo, was on the Martial Rankings as well, but he was at the bottom. Do you know how abnormal those little fellows at the top are? Let me explain it like this. Even I would dare not say that I’ll be able to defeat those monstrous geniuses in the top 10. Understand?”

Yang Ye was visibly shocked. He didn’t know how terrifying those monstrous geniuses in the top 10 were, but he was very well aware how terrifying this old geezer was. It could be said that while the old man wasn’t really at the Emperor Realm, he was absolutely not inferior to Lou Qianyun who was at the Emperor Realm!

Hao Tian continued, “Kid, her natural talent is absolutely extraordinary, and it’ll be a waste of her potential to leave her at White Deer Academy. Moreover, her life might be in danger as well. I’m sure you’ve realized that the internal strife within White Deer Academy is already at such a state, so why make her get mixed up in all of that?”

Su Shihe intended to say something, but he just sighed in the end.

He really wanted to keep An Nanjing. After all, it was the Martial God Physique! It had only appeared once in the history of the Radiant Dimension! However, he knew that unless the Law Faction and Scholarly Faction joined forces, it would be impossible to keep her. Moreover, based on the current circumstances, it was absolutely impossible!

Yang Ye remained silent for a long time before he lowered his head to look at An Nanjing, “What do you think?”

An Nanjing answered without the slightest hesitation, “I’ll go with you!”

Yang Ye shook his head slightly, “Jing’er, I’m sure you’ve realized that there are too many experts in this world, and we’re too weak. I want you to stay by my side, and I won’t want to be separated from you. But you won’t be of any help if you stay with me. Or I should say that staying with me will restrain your growth. Understand?”

He naturally wouldn’t allow her to stay in White Deer Academy. The Scholarly Faction was even on the verge of being unable to save itself, so how could it possibly protect An Nanjing? Just like the incident from before, if this old geezer from the Martial Sect hadn’t arrived, then the consequences would be unimaginable! Besides that, An Nanjing’s natural talent was absolutely superb, and it was even greater than his own. So long as she was given an opportunity and a platform to grow, then she would definitely ascend to greatness!

While he didn’t want her to leave and knew that she would definitely stay if he asked her to, he couldn’t act so selfishly. An Nanjing didn’t belong solely to him. She liked the Martial Dao, so she would definitely want to go further on the path towards the Martial Dao. Thus, he couldn’t restrain her!

An Nanjing gazed at him and said, “We can leave together!”

Su Shihe’s expression changed drastically when he heard An Nanjing. An Nanjing’s departure was an immeasurable loss to White Deer Academy, and if even Yang Ye left, then the Scholarly Faction would suffer a horrible loss.

Su Shihe was about to speak when Yang Ye shook his head. How could he be unable to discern that the old geezer from the Martial Sect only thought highly of An Nanjing? If he were to go with them, they wouldn’t attach importance to fostering him at all. Besides that, he couldn’t leave White Deer Academy. It wasn’t that he felt attachment to White Deer Academy, it was because Ocean of Clouds Academy needed the Scholarly Faction’s protection!

There was no relationship between the Martial Sect and Ocean of Clouds Academy, nor were there any linked interests between them. So, it was impossible for it to fight the Law Faction for Ocean of Clouds Academy.

Su Shihe instantly heaved a sigh of relief when he saw Yang Ye shake his head.

Yang Ye smiled when he saw An Nanjing remain silent, “I’ll support you regardless of what decision your make.”

An Nanjing suddenly raised her head and gazed at Hao Tian, “How strong are you?”

Experts were picky about their disciples, and true monstrous geniuses were naturally picky about their masters as well. Hao Tian naturally understood that principle as well, so he pointed at Li Laoguai and said, “We are both Quasi Emperors, but he’ll definitely lose to me within 100 moves!”

He gazed at Li Laoguai who’d revealed an unsightly expression and continued, “If you think I’m wrong, then we can spar right now!”

Li Laoguai’s face was extremely gloomy, and a short while passed before he spoke indifferently, “Senior Hao Tian is someone who’s about to leave this world. How could I be a match for Senior Hao Tian?”

Hao Tian roared with laughter, “Kid, you’re quite sensible. Otherwise, I’d definitely beat you up!”

He gazed at An Nanjing at this point and said, “Little girl, I won’t beat around the bush with you. The reason I’m anxious to take you as my disciple is because I’ll be leaving this world soon. My inheritance would come to an end if I don’t leave it behind before leaving Radiant Dimension. I haven’t had any disciples in the past because they weren’t up to my standards or weren’t suitable to receive my inheritance. But you aren’t just outstanding, you’re really suitable to receive my inheritance!”

An Nanjing said, “I’ll go with you!”

Hao Tian smiled, “Alright!”

An Nanjing added, “But I have a condition!”

Hao Tian replied, “Go on!”

She gazed at Yang Ye and said, “I want to stay behind and face the Law Faction with him!”

Hao Tian frowned slightly. Meanwhile, Yang Ye said, “There’s no need for that. Let me deal with the rest!” He didn’t want An Nanjing to miss such an opportunity because of him.

An Nanjing said, “I insist!”

Yang Ye didn’t know what to say.

Meanwhile, Wu Yuan who stood by Hao Tian’s side suddenly said, “There are only 3 rounds in the competition, and you’ve already won 2 rounds. So, there’s no need to continue competing.”

“Who says it isn’t necessary?” Meanwhile, Li Laoguai suddenly spoke, “The precondition to winning 2 out of 3 is that they are able to survive the 3rd round. If they die in the 3rd round, then it’s naturally my Law Faction that won.”

Hao Tian spoke indifferently, “Li Laoguai, it’s just 3 juniors. Is it necessary to act like this?”

Li Laoguai gazed at Hao Tian and said, “It’s related to the reputation of my Law Faction, and it’s related to my Law Faction’s future as well. Of course, if Senior Hao Tian really intends to interfere, then I’ll definitely be unable to stop Senior Hao Tian. However, my Law Faction isn’t a force that just allows others to bully it. If worse comes to worse, we can all ask our ancestors to descend to this dimension and have some fun.”

Hao Tian’s eyes narrowed slightly, and he revealed a hostile expression, “Are you threatening me?”

Li Laoguai looked Hao Tian straight in the eyes and didn’t shrink back at all, “My White Deer Academy hasn’t declined to the point of allowing outsiders to make decisions for it!”

The atmosphere here seemed like a battle would break out at any moment!

Suddenly, Yang Ye spoke, “Since you want to compete, then let’s continue!” If it was possible, he naturally wanted it to come to an end. However, the Law Faction clearly didn’t want to spare them. The reason he’d agreed was because the Law Faction was still abiding by the rules of the competition. But if that old geezer from the Martial Sect interfered, then it was very likely for the Law Faction to stop abiding by the rules.

Once that happened, Ocean of Clouds Academy would definitely suffer calamity. Not to mention anything else, just Xu Fan alone was sufficient to crush Ocean of Clouds Academy and City. As for the Martial Sect, he didn’t think they would fight the Law Faction for Ocean of Clouds Academy! So, he had to rely on himself!

Li Laoguai glanced at Yang Ye and spoke indifferently, “Since you don’t have a problem with it, then let’s start?”

“Wait!” Hao Tian suddenly gazed at Yang Ye and said, “Kid, they clearly intend to kill you! So are you sure?”

Yang Ye grinned, and then he gazed at Li Laoguai, “Will there be a 4th round after the 3rd?”

Li Laoguai spoke indifferently, “Don’t worry, this is definitely the last round!”

Yang Ye nodded, “What happens if we win?”

Li Laoguai replied, “Win and you can live. What else do you want?”

Meanwhile, Su Shihe suddenly spoke, “Yang Ye, don’t worry. If anyone acts against Ocean of Clouds Academy from today onwards, then it’s equivalent to attacking my Scholarly Faction.”

They’d lost An Nanjing, so he couldn’t allow Yang Ye to leave as well. If he didn’t promise Yang Ye anything, then it was very likely that Yang Ye would side with the Martial Sect and seek its protection.

Yang Ye glanced at Su Shihe and said, “Thank you!” That was exactly what he wanted to hear. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Li Laoguai laughed coldly, “The precondition is that you survive. Just see if the Scholarly Faction will protect that Ocean of Clouds Academy of yours if you’re dead!”

“Enough of nonsense!” Yang Ye looked Li Laoguai in the eyes and said, “What’s the 3rd round?”

Li Laoguai replied, “We’ll decide the victor in this round?”

Yang Ye replied, “Alright!”

Both An Nanjing and Xuwu Shen were injured, so it wasn’t suitable for them to fight another battle. Determining the victor in this round was exactly what he wanted.

Li Laoguai waved his right hand, and a stone platform appeared at the center of the square. It didn’t take long for the stone platform to transform into an arena of similar size to the one from before.

Li Laoguai said, “Go on in!”

Yang Ye glanced at Li Laoguai, “Don’t tell me you’re going to fight me in this round?”

“You aren’t qualified to fight me!” As soon as Li Laoguai finished speaking, a figure instantly arrived in the arena. It was none other than Xu Fan!

Xu Fan gazed coldly at Yang Ye, “I’m your opponent!”

“How shameless!” Xuwu Shen who was lying on the ground below immediately got up.

Hao Tian shook his head as well and said, “Now I know what shamelessness is truly like!”

Su Shihe’s face was extremely unsightly as well, “Xu Fan, have you no shame? Do you have no shame?”

Xu Fan laughed coldly, “Can I be blamed for his low realm of cultivation? If you aren’t satisfied, his Ocean of Clouds Academy can send another high-rank Saint to fight this battle.”

Yang Ye remained silent.

“What? You don’t have one?” Xu Fan laughed coldly, “Since you don’t have one, then you can’t blame me, right? If you want to blame someone, you should blame your Ocean of Clouds Academy for being useless!”

Yang Ye’s left wrist moved slightly, and the ancient sheath appeared in his grasp. After that, he condensed an intent sword and sheathed it. Once he was done, he gazed at Li Laoguai and said, “Let’s begin!”

Li Laoguai glanced at Yang Ye, and then he waved his right hand. Yang Ye and Xu Fan instantly entered a pocket of space.

Xu Fan laughed coldly upon entering the battlefield in the pocket of space, “Yang Ye, you....”

“Are you a dog? Why do you keep barking?” Yang Ye suddenly drew his sword at the same instant that he finished speaking!
