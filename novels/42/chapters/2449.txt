Chapter 2450 – Erya!

Was using swords in both hands difficult?

It wasn’t difficult for Yang Ye!

Because he’d used the sword and saber together in the past, and he’d merged them perfectly as well. Now, he was changing the saber to the sword, so it was much easier for him to use. After all, he was a sword cultivator! A true sword cultivator!

In the cultivation room, Yang Ye sat cross-legged on the ground while the various techniques of the Dual Sword Technique appeared in his mind!

He planned to master it!

Left-handed swordsmanship!

Yang Ye decided to take it step by step. He wanted to see how strong he was while using his sword in the left hand.

A day later, Yang Ye left the cultivation room and went to Erya!

He wanted her to be his sparring partner!

Erya licked her tanghulu as she stood outside her abode, “Your sparring partner?”

Yang Ye nodded.

Erya stretched out her hand, “What’s in it for me?”

Yang Ye’s face darkened.

When did she learn this from Snowy?

Erya blinked, “Big Brother Yang, being a sparring partner is very tiring, so it’s normal to pay for my effort, right?”

Yang Ye smiled, “Erya, what is our relationship? Speaking about compensation is so hurtful, isn’t it?”

Erya thought for a moment and said, “That does make sense. But don’t you humans have a saying? Even real brothers should keep clear accounts of everything. I think it makes lots of sense, don’t you?”

Yang Ye shrugged, “Go on, tell me what you want!”

Her eyes lit up, “I want to eat people like you and Big Sister An!”

Yang Ye glared at her, “Are you asking for a beating?”

She puckered her lips, “I want demons too, like that dragon. Only demons like that are delicious.”

Yang Ye had quite the headache.

What is she? If it’s humans, she wants the best; if it’s demons, she wants demons like a Primal True Dragon! Is she crazy?

Erya gazed at him with a pitiable expression and waited for his answer.

Yang Ye sighed softly and said, “Erya, how about I try my best to find you food? However, you must promise not to go outside and run wild. Both you and I are too weak when compared to this world.”

She thought for a moment and nodded. Just as Yang Ye had said, the world was very dangerous. Especially after they arrived at Desolate City, that feeling of hers grew even stronger. So, she glanced at Yang Ye, and then she suddenly felt that staying in this pagoda was really nice. Because she didn’t have to worry about anything. Of course, it would be better if she had a powerful demon to feast on every day.

Yang Ye walked over to her, rubbed her head, and said, “Don’t worry, I have many enemies, so you’ll have lots to eat!”

Erya hesitated for a moment and said, “Big Brother Yang, can you take me to see my grandfather once we leave the Desolate World? I really miss him!”

Yang Ye smiled, “Of course! We’ll head straight for Eternal Village once we leave this place. I want to see Auntie Vege and Master too.”

Erya cracked a very wide smile.

Yang Ye brought Erya to the Ascension Platform. It was the best place to fight. Because it was extremely strong and could endure powerful strength!

Erya clenched her right hand, “Big Brother Yang, are you sure that you want me to use my full strength?”

Yang Ye nodded, “Of course, don’t hold back! Bring it!”

She hesitated for a moment and said, “But I’m afraid that I’ll kill you!”

The corners of Yang Ye’s mouth twitched, “Go on, use all your strength! You don’t have to take responsibility if you really kill me!”

Erya nodded. She stopped hesitating and strode forward before slamming her fist at Yang Ye.

It was a very simple punch!

Yang Ye was very well aware of Erya’s strength, so he didn’t dare act carelessly. He circulated his profound energy and stabbed his sword forward with his left hand!

The Sword Domain!

However, he only used four swings!

He didn’t dare to use his full strength against Erya as he was afraid of hurting her! But it didn’t take long for him to regret that decision.

Bang!

An explosion resounded and Yang Ye was blasted away with his sword. He flew all the way out of the Ascension Platform!

A wisp of blood seeped out slowly from the corner of Yang Ye’s mouth, and his entire left hand was trembling!

On the Ascension Platform, Erya was stunned and hurried over to Yang Ye, “Big Brother Yang, why are you so weak? I haven’t even used my full strength!

Yang Ye almost spat out a mouthful of blood when he heard this!

Yang Ye leaped up and went to the Ascension Platform. He gazed at Erya and said, “Come on, let’s continue!”

Erya was slightly hesitant, “Big Brother Yang, maybe we shouldn’t. I’ll feel guilty if I kill you, I’m serious!”

Yang Ye glared at her, “If you don’t get over here, then you can dream of ever having a full stomach!”

As soon as Yang Ye finished speaking, she leaped over to Yang Ye and slammed her fist at him!

Erya’s strength was a little special. It was unlike his own physical strength or Huang Cangyue’s physical strength. It was another form of pure strength, and it was very terrifying!

This time, Yang Ye really didn’t dare to hold such immature thoughts as he’d previously had. Injure Erya? He would be lucky to avoid being injured by her!

Yang Ye didn’t go head-on against her fist because Erya’s speed was much more inferior than his!

When her fist arrived before him, Yang Ye suddenly moved sideways and dodged it. At the same time, his sword swept horizontally at her stomach.

It was swift like a bolt of lightning!

Erya couldn’t dodge it at all and was struck by Yang Ye’s sword. However, Yang Ye didn’t use the blade of his sword, he’d struck her with the blunt side of it. But just a moment later, he regretted his decision!

When the blunt side of Yang Ye’s sword struck her stomach, Yang Ye felt like his sword had struck a Super Divine Treasure. As for Erya, she wasn’t even shaken by it! Erya blinked and slammed her knee at Yang Ye’s stomach.

Yang Ye’s reaction was extremely swift, and he moved around 3m back. But at the same time, a wave of powerful energy slammed down at him.

It was Erya!

Yang Ye’s sword descended!

Five swings with the Sword Domain!

This time, Yang Ye didn’t hold back because he noticed that Erya was much stronger than he’d ever imagined!

However, Yang Ye was surprised by Erya’s actions. Because she didn’t try to defend herself or dodge his attack, and she just let it strike her head!

At the same time, her little fist slammed against Yang Ye’s stomach!

A mouthful of blood sprayed from Yang Ye, and then his figure was blasted away!

Yang Ye stopped around 3km away. He looked down at this stomach, and it had cracked open. It wasn’t just his stomach, his entire body was covered in cracks! Fortunately, he had the Primordial Violet Energy, so they were quickly healed. But that wasn’t the main point, the main point was that there were small cracks on the Sword Precursor’s blade.

Crack!

It was a Divine Treasure!

He’d struck her on the head, but his Divine Treasure had cracked!

Yang Ye took a deep breath and walked over to Erya. At this moment, she was touching the horns on her head, and Yang Ye’s gaze descended upon them. His sword had struck them earlier, and they’d stopped his sword!

Yang Ye asked, “Can I touch them?”

She glanced at him and nodded.

Yang Ye touched the horns. They were icy cold and quite solid. Besides that, there was nothing special about them.

Yang Ye asked, “What are these?”

She shook her head, “I don’t know. They just grew themselves!”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

Meanwhile, she added, “Big Brother Yang, are we going to continue?”

“Yes!” He hurriedly said, “Of course we are!”

So, their fight continued!

This time, Yang Ye didn’t hold back at all! Because he noticed that even if his blade struck her, her body remained completely unharmed!

Erya’s body was so strong that Yang Ye almost felt despair from it! He knew that perhaps only Executor could break through her defense! He would naturally not use it because his goal was to temper himself!

Chop, stab, flick, slash, slice…Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

On the Ascension Platform, Yang Ye executed basic sword moves over and over again. Needless to say, fighting Erya really trained his instinct and reaction. So long as he was even the slightest bit careless, he may be punched away by her!

So, he was exceptionally careful in battle with her.

Erya discovered some combat techniques while fighting Yang Ye too. So, she stopped fully utilizing brute strength, and she learned to dodge and use technique when fighting!

It could be said that both of them were improving tremendously.

Just like that, a day passed, two days passed, a month passed… A month later, Yang Ye started using two swords!

Once Yang Ye started using two swords, he gradually gained the upper hand against Erya!

Yang Ye’s dual swords were too quick, so quick that Erya could only defend herself against them. While her body forcefully resisted countless attacks from him, she didn’t have the slightest opportunity to fight back. The two swords descended upon her like an incessant storm! Even then, Erya wasn’t injured at all!

Her body was even more terrifying than a Divine Treasure!

However, Yang Ye didn’t use his madness intent. Once he did that, his combat strength would multiply. Moreover, he wouldn’t be able to control himself, and the slightest mistake may harm Erya.

After all, he had another sword!

Bang! Bang! Bang!

On the Ascension Platform, Erya was being completely suppressed. While she didn’t suffer any injury, she felt very aggrieved, extremely even!

As for Yang Ye, he grew fiercer and fiercer as the dual swords felt increasingly easier to use!

As Yang Ye swung his swords madly, the blood vessels beneath his skin started to tremble, and as they did, Yang Ye’s strength grew increasingly terrifying!

Every swing of his sword left a faint mark on Erya!

“AH!” Suddenly, Erya howled with fury.

At this moment, her eyes were crimson red, and she slapped her palms downward.

Bang!

The world shook!

A moment later, the short nails on Erya’s hands gradually lengthened, and it didn’t take long for them to grow a few dozen centimeters long!

Erya leaped forward with rage and pounced at Yang Ye. She clawed down against Yang Ye’s Sword Supreme.

Bang!

Yang Ye was blasted away, and the Sword Supreme started cracking as if it would shatter at any moment!

However, Erya didn’t stop and pounced at Yang Ye again!

Yang Ye’s expression changed drastically at the sight of this. He didn’t dare to continue using the Sword Supreme and Sword Precursor, and he hurriedly withdrew Executor!

Hiss!

A ray of light flashed!

It was Executor!

A short while later, Yang Ye was stunned on the spot!

Erya had grabbed Executor with her right hand, and she suddenly exerted force on it!

Executor started to bend!

She plans to break a Super Divine Treasure?

Yang Ye was flabbergasted!
