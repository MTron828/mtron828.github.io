Chapter 2254 – Undying Race! Let’s Fight!

An Nanjing’s expression changed when she heard the Unfettered One, and Burning Fury appeared in her grasp.

Meanwhile, the Unfettered One glanced at her, “You’re too weak right now!”

An Nanjing looked at the Unfettered One in the eyes without displaying any fear!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye said, “Why do you want to kill me?”

The Unfettered One walked slowly toward Yang Ye and pointed at Yang Ye’s forehead, “In the past, I left a memory seed with you. A very, very long time ago, I noticed that my Sword Dao had flaws, and I wanted to perfect it. However, I didn’t expect your father to notice this. He forcefully removed that seed, and then pursued me until now.”

He shook his head, “Unfortunately, he can’t kill me.”

Yang Ye spoke solemnly, “Then why do you want to kill me now?”

The Unfettered One closed his eyes slowly, “Your sword is born for emotion. The deeper your emotions and ties, the stronger it becomes. That’s a direct opposite of my Sword Domain. If I absorb you, perhaps I’ll be able to open up a new door in my Sword Dao.”

Yang Ye chuckled, “But you won’t do that!”

The Unfettered One gazed at Yang Ye, “Huh?”

Yang Ye looked the Unfettered One in the eyes, “Absorb another to perfect your own Sword Dao, you would never go so low. Right?”

A wisp of admiration flashed through the Unfettered One’s eyes.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye continued, “If I’m not wrong, your objective is to see the limits of a Sword Dao that relies on emotions, right?”

The Unfettered One nodded slightly, “But I don’t want to wait for too long. That thought plagues me while you’re alive, and I don’t want to have that thought.”

“Ten years!” Yang Ye suddenly said, “Give me ten years, and we’ll fight then. You’ll see what you wish to see, and I… will see what I want to see.”

The Unfettered One wanted to see the limits of a Sword Dao of emotion, and Yang Ye wanted to see the limits of a Sword Dao without emotion!

Was severing all thoughts and focusing on the sword really an invincible path?

Based on the current situation, the Unfettered One was invincible.

However, it couldn’t prove anything. The Unfettered One had started cultivating far before him and had arrived at his own limits. But Yang Ye hadn’t reached his own limits. Both him and the Unfettered One wanted to see each other’s limits.

The Unfettered One gazed at Yang Ye for a long time and said, “I’ll give you 15 years. No matter where you are, I’ll find you then. At that time, I hope you can defeat me. Otherwise, I’ll kill you.”

“Why?” An Nanjing suddenly asked, “According to knowledge, you don’t kill those whom you challenge!”

Yang Ye said, “If I can’t defeat him, then this Sword Dao isn’t a path worth taking anymore.”

The Unfettered One grinned and didn’t say anything.

Yang Ye gazed at him, “You’re leaving?”

The Unfettered One nodded, “It’s meaningless to stay.”

Yang Ye said, “You’ve defeated both those experts from the undying race?”

The Unfettered One replied, “I fought one of them, and I was quite disappointed.”

Yang Ye asked, “You’re not waiting for the other one?”

The Unfettered One shook his head, “No.”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Why?”

The Unfettered One said, “The outcome is the same!”

The corners of Yang Ye’s mouth twitched. He naturally understood what the Unfettered One meant. He meant that even if he waited for that other expert, the outcome would be the same. That person would be defeated!

Confidence!

Extraordinary confidence!

The Unfettered One suddenly said, “Actually, I really envy you!”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Huh?”

He glanced at his sword and explained, “I envy that you still have rivals, and I envy that there are people that can defeat you!”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

Meanwhile, the Unfettered One shook his head and left, “Don’t make me wait for too long.”

He’d left!

The Unfettered One left just like that.

15 years!

Yang Ye closed his eyes slowly. Yang Ye’s greatest enemy in 15 years would be the Unfettered one, and the pressure from that was much greater than the undying race!

“Are you afraid?” Meanwhile, a voice came from Yang Ye’s side.

Tian Xiu was standing beside him.

Yang Ye shook his head, “Of course not!”

Tian Xiu grinned, “There’s nothing to fear! I’m confident in you!”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Why?”

She spoke softly, “Because there are emotions in your heart. It wasn’t eternal life or invincibility that supported you all the way here, it was love.

Actually, to make it simpler, it could be explained by what was happening at this very moment. Yang Ye knew he was no match for the undying race, but he didn’t choose to cower. In the end, there were emotions in his heart, and he couldn’t abandon everything.

Tian Xiu added, “Remember this. If you stay true to your heart, you’ll have the strength to fight him in the future!”

Yang Ye shook his head, “I’ve never given it that much consideration. All I want to do now is to let everyone by my side live well!”

Tian Xiu nodded slightly, “How’s your cultivation in the Sword Domain?”

Yang Ye replied, “I can rapidly shrink my Sword Domain, but I still suffer from side effects after using it. While it won’t knock me out, I won’t be able to fight.”

Tian Xiu spoke softly, “It’ll be better once you get to the Progenitor Realm.”

The Progenitor Realm!

Yang Ye laughed bitterly, “When will I get there?”

She was about to speak when she suddenly gazed at the endless black holes, and then her eyes narrowed slightly. She waved her right hand, and a ray of dark light shot out and arrived before the door of light. At this moment, a middle aged man was standing there.

It was the undying race’s Xiao Lou!

The middle aged man’s eyes narrowed slightly at the sight of the ray of light, and he slapped his palm down.

Hiss!

The dark light exploded apart, but Xiao Lou was pushed back into the door of light.

But just a moment later, a terrifying wave of black energy rippled out of the door, and it pierced through space and arrived in the air above Void Spirit Continent. In an instant, the sky above the continent darkened!

Everyone in the city below was horrified!

Suddenly, Tian Xiu looked up, and then she slapped her palm upward. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Bang!

A huge ethereal palm shot up into the air and slammed against the black energy. In an instant, the black energy exploded apart, but countless shrill cries resounded from within the city.

Because many strands of black energy had descended to the city, and all those who came into contact with it had exploded into bits.

Tian Xiu glanced at the city and stomped her right foot down lightly.

Bang!

The remaining black energy in the city instantly vanished without a trace.

Suddenly, a black palm emerged from the door of light, and it instantly arrived in the sky above the city before pressing down again.

Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!

In the city, countless buildings were obliterated by it. At the same time, the entire ground started to tremble violently and collapse.

The world was shaking!

Tian Xiu’s eyes were icy cold. She stomped her right foot down and shot up into the air like a ray of dark light.

Bang!

The huge black palm exploded apart into countless black fragments of energy that rained down from above.

Tian Xiu waved her right hand lightly, and the black energy vanished.

The sky above the city gradually returned to calm.

Meanwhile, the door of light suddenly grew in size, and it didn’t take long for it to be dozens of times larger. At the same time, a voice came from within, “Eldest Brother was right, you are alive. Alright, we’ll put an end to this in three days.”

Tian Xiu glanced coldly at the door of light, “I’ll be waiting!”

No reply came from within the door of light.

The world fell silent once more.

In the sky above Void Spirit City, Yang Ye spoke solemnly, “Who was that?”

Tian Xiu replied, “The second-in-command of the undying race. They call him Lord Xiao Lou. While his strength isn’t bad, it isn’t formidable to me. If I’m not wrong, their patriarch should be about to emerge from his closed door cultivation.”

The patriarch of the undying race!

Yang Ye was visibly shocked, “Is he very strong?”

She gazed at him and said, “Only a single person in this world can kill him, and it’s that sword cultivator who just left!”

That sword cultivator!

Obviously, Tian Xiu was speaking about the Unfettered One!

Tian Xiu added, “That Demonic Artifact within you can accomplish it too.”

Yang Ye asked, “The Samadhi Flame?”

Tian Xiu shook her head, “The other one.”

The Primordial Axe of Creation!

Yang Ye frowned slightly, thought for a moment, and said, “Let me talk to the pagoda and see if we can release it!”

“Don’t!” She spoke solemnly, “It’s too strong. You can’t sense it, but I can. If it comes outside, the first to die will be you.”

She paused for a moment and continued, “Moreover, even if it doesn’t kill you, it will not help you. So, letting it leave your pagoda will only lead to endless future troubles.”

Yang Ye laughed bitterly, “Looks like I can only rely on myself!”

“Come with me!” Tian Xiu walked away once she finished speaking.

Yang Ye and An Nanjing quickly followed her.

They arrived at the cemetery, the same cemetery that housed all the past experts of the void spirit race.

It was a dense expanse of tombs.

Tian Xiu gazed at it for a long time and said, “I didn’t want to disturb your spirits, but the undying race is attacking once more. This time, we’ll put an end to the enmity between us!”

As soon as she finished speaking, a fluorescent bead appeared in her grasp, and she tossed it. It floated into the air above the cemetery.

In an instant, the entire cemetery started trembling.

A moment later, Yang Ye and An Nanjing watched with shock as spirits rose up from the cemetery, and it only took an instant for them to fill the area.

After they emerged, they knelt before Tian Xiu, “Your Majesty!”

Tian Xiu closed her eyes slowly, and then something flashed out of her forehead. An instant later, a weapon appeared by her side.

Netherworld Destiny!

A moment of silence ensued, and then Tian Xiu grabbed Netherworld Destiny and pointed it at the door of light, “Undying race! Let’s fight!”

“Let’s fight!” The spirits howled furiously in unison.
