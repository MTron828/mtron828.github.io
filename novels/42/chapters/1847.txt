Chapter 1848 – Let’s Take It!

“The Heavenly Saber Exalt?” Yang Ye gazed at Dark, “One of the four Heavenly Exalts?”

Dark nodded, “He’s said to be the number one in the Saber Dao throughout the medium universe. His attainments in it are divine!

Divine!

Yang Ye had a solemn expression on his face. Just like the sword, when one’s attainments in the saber were at a certain level, it would be extremely terrifying. For example, the Unfettered One had achieved such accomplishments. As for Yang Ye himself, while his attainments in the Sword Dao were formidable, it was quite a large way away from attaining such a level!

Yang Ye looked up at the sky. The man’s body had stiffened on the spot while disbelief filled his eyes. Obviously, even until the moment of his death, he didn’t believe that he’d actually died in the lower universe.

Yang Ye gazed silently at the man’s corpse.

An expert!

The Heavenly Saber Exalt who killed the man was a true peerless expert of this world! The 6th stage of the True Realm? It was nothing before an expert like that!

The man was dead. As for his treasure, it floated off towards the right. Yang Ye noticed that many people were staring at the treasure, but none dared to do anything.

A short while later, the saber behind the man’s back swooshed off into the air and vanished.

Once the saber vanished, the black disc vanished along with it.

It had been taken!

Many people instantly became extremely disappointed. That treasure wasn’t very useful to the Heavenly Saber Exalt. After all, his strength was obvious. But it was very useful to them.

One didn’t just need strength in this world, one needed equipment too. Sometimes, when one’s strength was sufficient, equipment could make up for it!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye gazed at Dark, “If the four Heavenly Exalts always do that, then we would practically have nothing to get!”

Dark shook his head slightly, “They don’t care about things like that. I was quite surprised that the Heavenly Saber Exalt made a move just now.”

Yang Ye said, “That makes more sense. Otherwise, it would be pointless for us to stay here!”

Dark replied, “However, since he has shown himself, the Heavenly Saber Exalt is clearly here for the experts descending from the large universe!”

Yang Ye shot a glance above him and said, “You said that someone strong was about to descend. How do all of you determine whether the person is strong or not?”

“Fluctuations!” Dark continued, “Chaotic streams of space reside above the barrier. If someone descends and is sufficiently strong, that person would tear open the chaotic flow of space there and not try to avoid it. So long as someone tears open the space up there, we’ll be able to sense it down here.”

He gazed at Yang Ye and continued, “You may not know the chaotic flow of space well. Let me explain it like this. Even the four Heavenly Exalts may not be able to tear through it by force. So, anyone capable of tearing through it before descending is definitely an extraordinary expert, and the treasures such a person carries will definitely be some of the best!”

Yang Ye shook his head, “All of you are robbing them!”

Dark replied, “You’re right. We are robbing them.”

Yang Ye said, “Have you encountered people that even the four Heavenly Exalts can’t kill?”

Dark nodded, “Of course. You know… there used to be five Heavenly Exalts. Yet now, there are only four. Do you know why? Because an old man in Daoist’s robes descended one day, and that Heavenly Exalt perished that day.”

An old man in Daoist’s robes!

Yang Ye was stunned when he heard this. It didn’t take long for him to shake his head and smile. He could only say that Heavenly Exalt was tired of living by trying to rob the old man in Daoist’s robes!

Meanwhile, Dark said, “Are you interested in attending a trade gathering?”

Yang Ye asked, “A trade gathering?”

Dark explained, “The people in our circle hold a gathering from time to time, and it’s for the sake of selling or exchanging things. For example, you have something precious, but it isn’t useful to you, so you can sell it or exchange it for something else.”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and nodded, “Alright!”

“Let’s go!” Dark vanished on the spot.

It only took a short while for Dark to lead Yang Ye to a black pavilion.

An old man appeared before them.

Dark flicked two fist-sized violet crystals over to the old man.

The old man took them and vanished on the spot.

Yang Ye asked, “What are those?”

“Spirit Crystals!” Dark explained, “They can help us recover our profound energy, and it’s the only thing that’s effective in replenishing our profound energy. It can be considered the currency in our circle.” He paused for a moment and said, “It’s very precious!”

Meanwhile, Yang Ye flipped his palm, and a thumb-sized violet crystal appeared on his palm, “Is it any different from this one?”

Dark’s gaze descended onto the violet crystal, and then he picked it up, “Such a pure spirit crystal. No, this isn’t an ordinary spirit crystal, it’s a low-grade spirit crystal. It doesn’t just replenish profound energy; it can heal as well!”

He gazed at Yang Ye and continued, “Where did you get it?”

Where did I get it?

Yang Ye really couldn’t answer the question. He couldn’t say that Snowy created it, right?

Meanwhile, Dark said, “That was rash of me.” He flicked the crystal back to Yang Ye, “It’s very useful. Just that one can be exchanged for at least ten ordinary spirit crystals. If you have many of them, you may be able to get some extraordinary treasures in there!”

He walked into the pavilion while he spoke.

Yang Ye glanced at the violet crystal in his grasp. He hadn’t expected this thing to actually be so precious to the point that even Quasi Enlightened Realm experts thought so highly of it. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

I think I should ask Snowy to make more!

As soon as he thought of her, she appeared on his shoulder.

Yang Ye gazed at her. At this moment, she was looking into the pavilion, and her eyes were filled with excitement.

A treasure!

She’s noticed the presence of a treasure!

Yang Ye took her in his arms and spoke seriously, “You can’t act rashly here, alright?”

She blinked while a pure and innocent expression filled her eyes.

Yang Ye pinched her cheek and said, “Don’t act like you don’t know what I’m saying. You can go back into the pagoda if you don’t promise me!”

At this moment, Snowy’s eyes opened wide, and then she hurriedly nodded before waving her claws to express that she wouldn’t act rashly…

Yang Ye didn’t know whether he should laugh or cry when he saw her reaction. He pinched her little nose gently, and then put her in his arms before entering the pavilion.

The hall within wasn’t very huge, and it was less than 3km wide. There weren’t many people within it either. Only around 30 people were here. However, he couldn’t sense their auras. Obviously, they’d concealed their cultivations.

Besides that, most of them were wearing masks or cloaks so that others couldn’t see their appearance.

They were seated all around the hall, and there were many things laid out before them. There were even some things which Yang Ye had never seen before.

Suddenly, Snowy pointed off into the distance.

Yang Ye looked along her claw, and he saw a black robed man seated cross-legged there. There were some things laid out before the man. Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and walked over.

Meanwhile, Dark suddenly appeared by his side, “This place is protected by a mysterious organization. Don’t act rashly!”

Yang Ye nodded.

Dark nodded slightly and walked towards the side.

Yang Ye walked over to the black robed man. There were three things laid out before the man. A dagger with a small piece chipped off, a damaged map, and a fist-sized blue pearl.

Snowy and Yang Ye’s gazes descended onto the pearl because it contained extremely abundant spirit energy!

“A Spirit Energy Pearl!” Meanwhile, the black robed man said, “It contains the spirit energy of three large worlds. I’ll take a defensive treasure at the low-grade of the Imperial Rank.”

The low-grade of the Imperial Rank? Yang Ye was about to ask when Snowy pointed at the pearl, pointed at him, then pointed at herself.

She wanted it!

Yang Ye rubbed her head and gazed at the black robed man, “Will you take spirit crystals?”

The man shook his head, “No.”

Snowy blinked, and then she gazed at Yang Ye and started waving her claws.

It didn’t take long for Yang Ye’s face to darken.

Snowy wanted him to just take it!

Yang Ye’s face was dark. How did she become like a bandit! She keeps wanting to steal from others. I have to teach her well later. Otherwise, she’ll get into deep trouble in the future!

Meanwhile, the black robed man suddenly spoke, “Leave if you don’t have any!”

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and withdrew a blood red armor. It was what the woman in a red dress had given him. He didn’t know if it was at the rank which the man wanted, and he was just giving it a try.

The black robed man glanced at the armor and said, “Are you here to joke around? You dare offer me trash like that?!”

Yang Ye felt speechless.

Meanwhile, Snowy suddenly withdrew a Lifespan Fruit. She pointed at the black robed man and pointed at the fruit. She seemed to be asking if it was alright.

The black robed man glanced at the fruit and shook his head. Meanwhile, Snowy withdrew another one.

The black robed man said, “I don’t need lifespan.”

Snowy blinked, and then a violet crystal appeared in her paw. She gazed hopefully at the black robed man. Obviously, she was asking if this was enough.

However, the black robed man still shook his head, “I only want a defensive treasure at the Imperial Rank!”

Snowy turned to look at Yang Ye, and then she pointed at the pearl. After that, she started waving her claws again.

Yang Ye’s face darkened once more.

Because Snowy said, ‘Let’s just take it!’
