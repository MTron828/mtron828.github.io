Chapter 1559 - The Slaughter Begins!

Translator: InVader

Mo Jiang had an extremely unsightly expression on his face.

Even though he’d heard about Yang Ye in the past, he hadn’t taken Yang Ye seriously. Because besides a few powers, the Divine Phoenix Clan didn’t fear anyone on Sky Sky Continent. So, a Deity like Yang Ye was nothing to them.

A Deity!

A Deity wasn’t even an ant in the eyes of the Divine Phoenix Clan!

However, when Yang Ye activated the Stellar Sword Diagram, he knew that this ant before him may be able to heavily injure the Divine Phoenix Clan!

At this moment, it was pointless no matter what he said!

Mo Jiang waved his hand, and his voice resounded through the entire Phoenix Domain, “Activate the Thousand Flame Formation!”

Bang!

As soon as Mo Jiang finished speaking, a barrier of fire suddenly appeared around Phoenix Domain. After that, countless pillars of fire surged incessantly into the barrier of fire.

In an instant, the entire area above the Phoenix Domain was covered in pillars of fire and stellar sword energy.

When the pillars of fire slammed against the stellar sword energy, the space throughout the sky started to tremble violently while rumbling resounded incessantly.

It didn’t take long for the pillars of fire to grow fewer and fewer while Yang Ye’s stellar sword energy grew greater and greater in number. They were simply endless.

At this moment, if one stood in the Phoenix Domain and looked up, one would notice that the entire sky was covered in stellar sword energy. It was like a storm, and the powerful sword intent within them caused countless phoenixes to shudder with fear!

The sword energy there carried Returnal Rank sword intent!

The Thousand Flame Formation was on the verge of destruction. But numerous phoenixes suddenly shot up into the sky. There weren’t many of them, and there were less than 100 in the group. However, the weakest amongst them was at the Dualism Realm while there were 27 Rebirth Realm experts amongst them. The joint forces of so many experts was actually able to stop the stellar sword energy.

Even though they’d succeeded at stopping the stellar sword energy, the Divine Phoenix Clan paid quite a price. Because numerous phoenixes were killed during this process, it was quite a solemn and stirring scene to watch so many phoenixes crash down from the sky.

However, the stellar sword energy was still descending incessantly towards the Phoenix Domain.

Once he saw the experts of the Divine Phoenix Clan succeed at stopping the stellar sword energy, Mo Jiang immediately looked at Yang Ye. He didn’t hesitate to charge at Yang Ye. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Yang Ye didn’t waste his breath either, and he withdrew the casket lid before charging at Mo Jiang.

The Sword Spirit was there to control the stellar sword energy, so he didn’t have to do anything.

His job was to buy time, buy time as best as he could. The more time he bought, the more phoenixes would die.

Mo Jiang was extremely swift to the point that Yang Ye couldn’t even see his movements. Fortunately, while Yang Ye couldn’t see them, he could sense them.

Bang!

A loud explosion resounded, and then Yang Ye was blasted away along with his casket lid. However, it didn’t take long for him to stop, and then he charged at Mo Jiang again.

Even though he was a Deity, he was still no match for the patriarch of the Divine Phoenix Clan, Mo Jiang. It was understandable because Mo Jiang could be ranked at the top even throughout the entire continent. However, Mo Jiang couldn’t do anything to Yang Ye who had the casket lid to protect himself. Even though Yang Ye was always at a disadvantage when they collided, Yang Ye didn’t suffer any real harm!

Meanwhile, more and more phoenixes were being struck down. Moreover, as more and more of them were struck down, gaps in their defenses started to appear successively. This allowed more and more stellar sword energy to descend into the Phoenix Domain. As soon as those strands of stellar sword energy descended to the ground, howls of sorrow resounded throughout the Phoenix Domain!

These strands of stellar sword energy which were enhanced by Returnal Rank sword intent could even kill Rebirth Realm experts, so how could the ordinary phoenixes defend themselves against it?

Little Sky seemed to be quite unable to endure watching the scene before her. Even though she felt that the Divine Phoenix Clan shouldn’t have imprisoned the Sprite Lord and should be taught a lesson, those ordinary phoenixes were innocent. She wanted to persuade them, but she knew that it was useless. Because the Divine Phoenix Clan wouldn’t make a compromise, and if it didn’t, then Yang Ye wouldn’t.

It was impossible to resolve!

The current situation was one that would only end in the death of someone.

Mo Jiang started to become anxious as he fought Yang Ye. He’d planned to end Yang Ye quickly, because once Yang Ye was dealt with, then the stellar sword energy would vanish. However, he hadn’t expected Yang Ye to be so strong, and he was utterly unable to do anything to Yang Ye. At the very least, he couldn’t do anything to Yang Ye in the short term!

If this continued, more and more phoenixes would perish. Actually, countless had perished by now.

When he thought up to this point, Mo Jiang closed his eyes slowly once he pushed Yang Ye back. A moment later, he flipped his right hand. In an instant, an ink black flame appeared on his palm, and then the space around him started to turn ethereal. It was because the flame was too hot!

Meanwhile, Little Sky’s voice resounded, “That’s the Nether Death Flame. It’s ranked at the third position amongst all the divine flames. Be careful!”

Mo Jiang glanced at Little Sky. He hadn’t expected her to recognize the flame in his palm. However, he didn’t have the time to ask her how she knew about it, and he just turned to look at Yang Ye, “It’s over!”

As soon as he finished speaking, his figure vanished on the spot, and it didn’t take long for a flaming phoenix to appear here. This flaming phoenix wasn’t very large, but the pressure it emanated was extremely terrifying. Moreover, its body was suffused by ink black flames.

It shot straight towards Yang Ye! It was a very simple and direct attack!

Yang Ye tightened his grip on the casket lid and was about to swing it. However, Little Sky Flame suddenly emerged from within him.

Little Sky was shocked by this and said, “Little Fellow, head back in there right now. You’re no match for that flame.”

Little Sky Flame cracked a smile, and then two balls of fire appeared on her palms. After that, she tossed them forward. The balls of flame collided directly against the flaming phoenix. Once she was done, Little Sky Flame turned around and entered the Primordial Pagoda.

Meanwhile, the balls of flames instantly exploded apart once they came into contact with the flaming phoenix. In an instant, an ocean of flames swept through the surroundings. The ocean of flames enveloped the phoenix, and then Yang Ye watched with astonishment as the ink black flames around the phoenix actually dimmed down!

“What flame is that?!” Mo Jiang’s shocked voice resounded from within the ocean of flames, and then he returned to his human form and moved almost 10km away. His eyes were filled with shock.

Yang Ye was stunned as well. Little Sky Flame is that strong?

But it only took an instant for Yang Ye to come to an understanding, and he realized that it might have been the Divine Yin Flame. Even though Little Sky Flame was strong, she was much inferior when compared to the flames that Mo Jiang was using. So, those two balls of flames had definitely come from the Divine Yin Flame.

At this moment, Yang Ye realized that the Divine Yin Flame was much stronger than he’d ever imagined! What was the Divine Phoenix Clan least afraid of? It was flames. It wasn’t a joke when people said that phoenixes were reborn in flames. Flames were extremely nourishing to phoenixes. However, the Divine Yin Flame could actually injure a Divine Phoenix that lived on flames, so it was obvious how strong the Divine Yin Flame was!

Yang Ye really wanted to make it come out here and help. However, it had been constantly ignoring him. If it was willing to help, then the so-called divine flames of the Divine Phoenix Clan would be useless against him. Once the phoenixes of the Divine Phoenix Clan lost their ability to use flames against him, their strength would plummet.

Unfortunately, the Divine Yin Flame was ignoring him!

Stellar sword energy was still descending incessantly, and the phoenixes in the sky were still reducing in number.

Even if the Divine Phoenix Clan won this battle, it would be a pyrrhic victory. From now onwards, the Divine Phoenix Clan would be in an extremely weakened state!

Mo Jiang suddenly spoke in a low voice, “Yang Ye! Do you really intend to cause our mutual destruction?”

“Mutual destruction? Hahaha!” Yang Ye laughed like a madman, “Yes, you’re right, that’s exactly what I intend to do. I want the Divine Phoenix Clan to vanish from this continent! I want the Divine Phoenix Clan to go extinct!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he withdrew an Energy Pearl and swallowed it. After that, he charged at the phoenixes which were defending the Phoenix Domain against his stellar sword energy.

He couldn’t kill Mo Jiang, but he could kill the other phoenixes!

Mo Jiang’s expression changed drastically when he saw Yang Ye charge at the others, and he immediately charged at Yang Ye.

“AH!” Suddenly, a shrill cry resounded, and then a phoenix’s head was separated from his body, and blood surged out from his neck and descended. The blood seemed like a flowing waterfall, and it was an extremely horrifying sight.

In an instant, the blood transformed into pillars of blood that surged towards Yang Ye and were absorbed by him.

The slaughter had begun!

Yang Ye didn’t go head-on against Mo Jiang, and he just used Heaven’s Gravestone to target the phoenixes that were easy to kill. In just around a dozen breaths of time, Yang Ye had killed over a dozen phoenixes. Moreover, as fewer and fewer phoenixes were left to stop the stellar sword energy, countless strands of sword energy descended into the Phoenix Domain. Once they struck the Phoenix Domain, they caused disastrous damage throughout the place. Countless phoenixes died miserably, and then they were transformed into pillars of blood that surged into Yang Ye.

In the sky, the stellar sword energy and pillars of blood that filled it had formed a very strange scene.

At this moment, Mo Jiang was quite anxious.

Mo Jiang wasn’t the only one, panic had spread throughout the Divine Phoenix Clan. After all, if this continued, the Divine Phoenix Clan wouldn’t just end up suffering heavy losses.

Meanwhile, Mo Jiang suddenly spoke fiercely, “Ignore the sword energy and focus your energy on killing Yang Ye!”

As soon as they heard his orders, the Rebirth Realm experts that were defending Phoenix Domain against the stellar sword energy immediately stopped and charged at Yang Ye.

So, if Mo Jiang was included, there were around 25 Rebirth Realm experts charging at Yang Ye!

Bang!

Suddenly, a terrifying pillar of blood surged up into the sky from Yang Ye. In an instant, the entire sky turned blood red!

Returnal Rank slaughter intent!

Dual Returnal Rank intents!
