Chapter 1780 – Lin Weiyang!

At this moment, Yang Ye didn’t look quite the same.

His hair was actually slightly white. It seemed like his head was covered in snow. His hair wasn’t the only thing that had changed, his face had aged quite a bit. If he seemed like he was over 20 before, he looked around 40 now!

Maturity!

At this moment, Yang Ye seemed like he’d matured tremendously.

Suddenly, Ling Xiu appeared before Yang Ye and Yun Qian.

Ling Xiu gazed at Yang Ye, “How did it go?”

Yang Ye looked down at his hand, and then he slowly stretched it out before waving it lightly!

Bang!

Yun Qian watched with astonishment as the space throughout the pavilion actually started trembling. It seemed like boiling water that was surging violently. However, she couldn’t sense any fluctuations of energy.

Meanwhile, Ling Xiu spoke softly, “Enlightened Rank sword intent…. It’s not within the five elements, not in the heavens and the earth, completely untraceable, and can merge into all things… Congratulations!”

Yun Qian’s mouth opened wide with shock when she heard Ling Xiu.

Enlightened Rank sword intent!

Yang Ye had actually attained Enlightened Rank sword intent in such a short while!

Actually, it hadn’t been a short while.

It had been 30 days in the outside world, so 300 days had passed in the Primordial Pagoda. 300 days was almost a year!

Besides comprehending, Yang Ye had been exploring throughout the year. He was slowly exploring and pondering. Only he understood how dull and miserable he had been. There was a point in time within the Primordial Pagoda that his mind had gone black!

That had been the most painful period for him. Because he’d become lost. In the end, he even felt like giving up. That feeling that his head was filled with lead was truly too painful.

Fortunately, he didn’t give up!

After comprehending bitterly, he finally improved his sword intent to the Enlightened Rank. Moreover, his sword intent wasn’t the only intent that had improved, his slaughter intent had attained the Enlightened Rank too.

The biggest difference between the Enlightened Rank and True Rank was that the Enlightened Rank wasn’t within the five elements, not in the heavens and the earth, untraceable and could merge into all things. The Enlightened Rank contained the truth as well. It contained the essence of the sword and all things, and it was an improvement on the foundation created by the True Rank.

It was like mist transformed into water, and then the water was transformed into ice!

So, the Enlightened Rank didn’t overturn the True Rank, it built upon the True Rank!

It could be said that he didn’t fear 6th stage True Realm experts anymore. Of course, it still wasn’t that easy to kill them in single combat. However, he wouldn’t be completely suppressed in battle with them anymore!

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts and gazed at Ling Xiu, “Thank you.”

If it wasn’t for her guidance and experience, even he didn’t know how long it would have taken him to attain the Enlightened Rank. No matter what her objective was, she had helped him!

“It’s your own fortune!” She continued, “Your strength has definitely risen tremendously along with the improvement of your two intents. But remember not to underestimate anyone. Especially some 6th stage True Realm experts.”

Yang Ye nodded, “I understand. I won’t underestimate anyone!”

Underestimating one’s opponent was the most lethal mistake one could make. Many people hadn’t died at his hands because their strengths were inferior to him, they’d died because they’d underestimated him.

Never underestimate anyone!

Suddenly, Ling Xiu said, “Can I see the wooden sword?”

Yang Ye glanced at her and nodded. He flipped his palm, and then Snowy appeared on his palm while holding the wooden sword in her arms.

“A Sprite Lord!” Ling Xiu’s gaze shot to Snowy. Snowy looked up at Ling Xiu and cracked a smile in response.

Ling Xiu grinned and gazed at Yang Ye, “What a lucky fellow. But I don’t understand something. This little fellow should be fond of pure and kind people, but if I’m to be honest, you’re not pure or kind at all!”

Yang Ye’s face darkened. Does she know how to speak?!

Meanwhile, Snowy suddenly released the wooden sword and wrapped her arms around Yang Ye’s neck. After that, she rubbed her head gently against Yang Ye’s chin as if she was saying that she likes him just the way he was.

Yang Ye’s heart felt warm. He rubbed Snowy’s little head and spoke softly, “I love you too!”

Meanwhile, Ling Xiu waved her right hand, and the wooden sword flew over to her. A moment of silence ensued before she gazed at Yang Ye and Snowy, “Kid, tell me the truth. Is this sword following you or this little fellow?”

Yang Ye’s face stiffened, but it didn’t take long for it to return to normal. He gazed at her and asked, “Senior, why do you ask?”

She replied, “This sword is pure and kind, and it likes pure and kind people, demons, or sprites. That little fellow of yours just happens to conform to that. But you don’t! Moreover, it should really reject you!”

Yang Ye didn’t say anything and just waved his left hand. The wooden sword immediately flew into his grasp, and then he waved it slightly. A sword howl instantly resounded.

Yang Ye gazed at Ling Xiu, “Senior, do you think it rejects me?”

Actually, the wooden sword did reject him. However, after what happened previously, it had restrained itself tremendously. At the very least, it wouldn’t act rashly and willfully as it did in the past. The Primordial Pagoda had to be given credit for that!

Ling Xiu gazed at Yang Ye for a long time, and then she nodded lightly, “That isn’t important. The important point is that your strength has improved. I hope you’ll remember your promise to me!”

Yang Ye nodded, “Of course.” Actually, it was just as Su Mu had said. After he obtained the wooden sword, the karma of the wooden sword had coiled onto him.

Ling Xiu nodded slightly, “The experience of the other sect masters of my Secret Sect and some powerful techniques are within her. Are you interested in them?”

“Of course I am!” Yang Ye hurriedly nodded. What a joke! How could he not be interested in something like that?

She said, “It’s better to focus than spread your attention on many. The sword technique you created is extremely powerful, and it really suits you. While the techniques of many sect masters aren’t inferior to yours, most of them are suitable to themselves and not suitable for you.”

She paused for a moment and continued, “Head to the third level. There’s something suitable for you there!!

As soon as she finished speaking, she intended to enter the pillar of light.

Yang Ye suddenly asked, “May I know if you’re still alive?”

She turned to look at him, “I died a long time ago. This is a strand of soul that I left behind. It’s to pass down my inheritance to the next generation. This may be the last time I show myself. Of course, I hope this is the last time.”

Yang Ye asked, “Why?”

She fell silent for a moment and replied, “Because if I show myself again, it represents that….”

She shook her head and vanished on the spot.

Yang Ye glanced at the pillar of light. Based on her tone, Yang Ye realized that something major may be about to happen in the Secret Sect!

Meanwhile, Yun Qian suddenly asked, “How did you attain the Enlightened Rank?”

Yang Ye gazed at her, “Miss Yun, my natural talent isn’t great. I just spent more time on it than you did. Go comprehend it well, and you’ll succeed too!”

He went towards the third level once he finished speaking.

Was his natural talent greater than her?

No!

His natural talent wasn’t good at all. Because he’d spend ten times the time Yun Qian had spent on comprehending everything they gained from Ling Xiu. Even though his natural talent wasn’t the best, his willpower was absolutely superior to Yun Qian. Or it should be said that his will power was superior to many!

Persistence, hard work, and never giving up!

That was the secret to his success!

Yun Qian lowered her head slightly and remained silent. A long time passed before she turned around and left the hall.

It didn’t take long for Yang Ye to arrive at the 3rd level under the old man in a luxurious robe’s lead.

The old man stopped abruptly and said, “Young Master Yang, this is a forbidden area of my Secret Sect, and it’s the place where the ancestor of my Secret Sect sleeps. So, please mind your actions!”

He hadn’t forgotten how Yang Ye had pointed his sword at Ling Xiu!

Yang Ye smiled embarrassedly, “I will!”

The old man glanced at him and nodded, “Please go in!”

Yang Ye asked, “You’re not coming?”

The old man shook his head, “I can’t!”

Yang Ye asked, “Why?”

The old man gazed at the door and said, “Because the person in there once said that he shouldn’t be disturbed.”

Yang Ye asked, “Then why can I go in?”

The old man laughed bitterly, “Because Sect Master Ling asked you to. I dare not disobey her orders!” Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

The old man said, “Go on!”

Yang Ye glanced at the old man and said, “Is it safe?”

The old man hesitated for a moment and replied, “I think so!”

Yang Ye asked, “Can you be sure?”

The old man shook his head, “That person’s temper is a little strange.”

The corners of Yang Ye’s mouth twitched. He didn’t say another word and just entered through the door.

The old man took a deep breath when he saw Yang Ye enter, and he said, “I’ll pray for you!”

…

As soon as Yang Ye entered through the door, Yang Ye noticed that there was only a single pillar of light in here, and it was more than double the size of the pillar of light which Ling Xiu emerged from!

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings. In the end, his gaze descended onto the pillar of light and spoke softly, “Hey, is anyone here?”

He received no reply.

Yang Ye walked over to the pillar of light and gazed at the bottom of it. There was a name there — Lin Weiyang!

Lin Weiyang? Yang Ye sized up the pillar. Suddenly, a hand grabbed his throat.

A suffocating feeling enveloped Yang Ye!

A moment later, the hand lifted Yang Ye up. At the same time, a voice resounded, “Who allowed you in?”

Crack!

Yang Ye was about to speak when the sound of bones cracking resounded!
