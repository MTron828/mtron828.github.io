Chapter 1658 - That’s None Of Your Fucking Business!

Translator: InVader

Ku Zhuyi’s face turned cold when she heard him, and she was about to speak.

However, Yang Ye suddenly walked over to the young man, “What’s wrong with the Rebirth Realm? Tell me, what’s wrong with it?”

Ku Zhuyi glanced at Yang Ye and remained silent. But her bamboo splint had appeared in her grasp.

The young man glanced at his chest. There was an extremely long injury there.

A moment of silence ensued before he looked up at Yang Ye, “Do you want to die?”

Yang Ye chuckled, and then his right foot twisted slightly against the ground. In an instant, his figure vanished on the spot. At the moment he vanished, both Ku Zhuyi and the man’s expressions changed. They were about to attack, but it was too late. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Yang Ye had appeared behind the young man, and his sword was pressed against the young man’s back.

The young man’s figure stiffened, and he didn’t dare move at all.

Meanwhile, Ku Zhuyi gazed coldly at Yang Ye in silence, and she just held tightly onto her bamboo splint.

Suddenly, Yang Ye withdrew his sword and went back to Ku Zhuyi’s side. After that, he gazed at the young man and said, “Why do you have to look down on others? As a cultivator, you should remain modest at all times. Because only then will you be able to improve. If you’re self-satisfied or conceited, you’ll never be able to improve. Understand?”

Ku Zhuyi glanced at Yang Ye. She didn’t speak a word, but the icy coldness in her eyes was gradually vanishing.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye continued, “Your strength isn’t bad. If you fought me normally, then the outcome wouldn’t be certain. However, you weren’t even able to stop a single attack of mine. Besides the fact that I launched a surprise attack against you, there’s another reason. It’s because you looked down on me. You thought I’m just a Rebirth Realm cultivator, so you looked down at me from the bottom of your heart, and that’s the reason you lost so horribly.”

The young man was looking at Yang Ye, and the hostility and anger in his eyes was gradually vanishing. A short while passed before he cupped his fist at Yang Ye, “Thank you for your guidance.”

Yang Ye nodded, “What a promising young man!”

The corners of the young man’s mouth twitched slightly, and his face became quite unsightly.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye added, “Please help me notify your Grand Elder. Tell him that I may be able to treat the Soul Nurturing Tree.”

The young man hesitated for a moment and nodded, “Wait a moment!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he turned around and entered the hall.

Once the young man left, Yang Ye gazed at Ku Zhuyi and asked, “What do you think?”

She glanced indifferently at him, “What do you think?”

Yang Ye shrugged and said, “No matter how much you explain, it’s easier to just display my strength to him. Once he has witnessed it, he’ll naturally stop looking down on me. See, didn’t he immediately go on and report our arrival to your Grand Elder?”

Ku Zhuyi turned to look at Yang Ye, “Do you always act as you please?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “Not always. Once in a while!”

She replied, “How have you survived until now?”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

Ku Zhuyi was about to say something when the young man suddenly walked out of the hall, and he said, “Come in.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he turned around and vanished into the hall.

Ku Zhuyi withdrew her gaze and vanished into the hall as well.

Yang Ye quickly followed after her.

…

In the hall.

An old man in a luxurious robe sat at the seat of the host. He was the Grand Elder of the Ku Clan, Ku Rong. Besides that, there was a black robed and violet robed middle aged man on the left and right sides of the hall. When Yang Ye’s group of three entered, the gazes of the three people in the hall had instantly descended upon them.

Ku Rong sized up Yang Ye and asked, “Young Brother, where are you from?”

Yang Ye told the truth, “The Yang Clan!”

The Yang Clan! A wisp of surprise flashed through Ku Rong’s eyes. He sized up Yang Ye once more and asked, “You said you’re able to treat the Soul Nurturing Tree?”

Yang Ye replied, “I dare not guarantee it. But I can try.”

Ku Rong nodded slightly. He was about to speak when the black robed old man on Yang Ye’s left spoke abruptly, “How laughable. A mere Rebirth Realm cultivator actually speaks about treating the Soul Nurturing Tree. How truly laughable.”

Yang Ye turned and glanced at the black robed old man, and then he spoke indifferently, “That’s none of your fucking business.”

“How dare you!” The old man erupted with rage, and then a terrifying aura slammed down in Yang Ye’s direction.

The Half-Step True Realm!

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly. He was about to draw his sword when Ku Rong suddenly waved his right hand, and an invisible wave of energy flashed through the area. In an instant, the black robed old man’s aura vanished without a trace, and it seemed like it had never been there!

The Half-Step True Realm! Yang Ye glanced at the Grand Elder. He’d realized that the Grand Elder was at the Half-Step True Realm as well. However, based on what the Grand Elder had just done, the Grand Elder was probably much stronger than the black robed old man.

Meanwhile, Ku Rong stood up slowly, “Brother Mo Lin, why stoop down to the level of a junior?”

The black robed old man, Mo Lin, grunted coldly and didn’t say another word.

Meanwhile, Ku Rong smiled, “All of you’ve said that you can treat the Soul Nurturing Tree. Since that’s the case, why don’t we give it a try? Don’t worry, so long as you can really treat it, then I’ll agree to your requests…” He gazed at Yang Ye at this point and asked, “May I know what you want?”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and replied, “I want a piece of Soul Nurturing Wood.”

Ku Rong glanced at Yang Ye and said, “So long as you can nurse it back to health, my Ku Clan can give you one.”

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and said, “Can I still get one if I fail?”

Ku Zhuyi’s eyelids twitched when she heard Yang Ye, and then she turned away as if she didn’t know him.

She felt he was too shameless!

Absolutely shameless!

Ku Rong had quite a strange expression on his face as well. Obviously, he hadn’t expected that Yang Ye would say something like that. He glanced at Yang Ye and said, “Err… I don’t think that’s possible!”

Yang Ye intended to say something else, but Ku Zhuyi pulled on his sleeve and glared at him.

Yang Ye felt speechless.

Meanwhile, Ku Rong said, “Let’s go.”

As soon as he finished speaking, his figure vanished on the spot.

Yang Ye was about to leave when he suddenly gazed at Mo Lin. Even though he couldn’t see Mo Lin’s appearance, he could sense that Mo Lin was looking at him, and Mo Lin’s gaze was filled with hostility.

Yang Ye sized up Mo Lin and said, “Forget it. I’ll just apologize, and let’s just forget it ever happened. Alright?”

“Apologize?” Mo Lin laughed coldly, “You think an apology will make a difference? Little Bastard, I’ll make living worse than death for you once you leave the Ku Clan, and I’ll…”

“Fuck you!” Suddenly, Yang Ye drew his sword and pointed it at Mo Lin, “Old Man, why don’t we head out and fight one on one right now?”

“Do you think I’m afraid of you?” As he spoke, Mo Lin was about to attack.

However, Ku Rong suddenly appeared before them again, and he glanced at them before he said, “The Ku Clan isn’t an arena.”

Mo Lin grunted coldly and vanished on the spot.

Ku Rong gazed at Yang Ye and said, “Young man, it’s good to have guts, but being too unyielding will lead to a quicker death. So, exercising forbearance and taking a step back are still necessary.”

Yang Ye chuckled and said, “I can’t endure it with my temper. If someone bullies me, then I like to give it back to them. We’re all humans, so why would I fear anyone? However, what you said does make sense, and I’ll keep it in mind.”

Ku Rong glanced at Yang Ye and said, “You’re a disciple of the Yang Clan, so you’ll be fine if you immediately contact the experts of the Yang Clan when you’re leaving.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he turned around with the intent to leave, but he seemed to have thought of something and suddenly gazed at Ku Zhuyi, “Come with us!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he vanished on the spot.

A wisp of joy flashed through Ku Zhuyi’s eyes, and she quickly followed the Grand Elder.

Yang Ye shrugged and followed them as well.

It didn’t take long for their group to arrive at a forest. The forest was huge, and every single tree in it was extremely tall. Moreover, they were extremely large.

Once they entered the forest, Yang Ye instantly felt like he was quite tiny.

Besides that, he sensed a strand of mysterious energy. He didn’t know what it was in the beginning, but in the end, he noticed what it was. The mysterious energy was Soul Energy!

As they went deeper into the forest, the Soul Energy grew thicker and thicker. Yang Ye glanced at Ku Zhuyi, and he finally knew why she was so happy. This place was extremely beneficial to the soul. Because his soul was automatically absorbing the Soul Energy at a slow pace!

Just like that, around an hour passed before Ku Rong stopped. There was a huge round platform not too far away from them, and a small 10m tall tree was on the platform. The top of the small tree seemed like it had been cut off with a sharp blade, and it was smooth like a mirror.

There were only a few leaves around the small tree, and Yang Ye noticed that its lower half was withering.

The Soul Nurturing Tree!

Yang Ye knew that the small tree before him was the Soul Nurturing Tree. Because it was ceaselessly emanating thick Soul Energy.

Yang Ye sized up the tree, and there was a trace of burning desire in his eyes. So long as he obtained a piece of it, he would be able to revive Little Sky.

He was just about to speak when the tiny vortex within him suddenly started to revolve!

Yang Ye was slightly stunned when he sensed this, and then his expression changed drastically. He hurriedly shouted in his heart, “Bro! You can’t act rashly! I’ll be killed!”
