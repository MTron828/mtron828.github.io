Chapter 2197 – No Sages for the Barbaric Race!

The Nansi Clan!

After he left Guman Estate, Yang Ye went to the Nansi Clan.

The Nansi Clan was in a city called Colossal Sky City, and it was one of the few peaceful cities in the Barbaric Dimension. It was mainly because of the Nansi Clan.

The Nansi Clan could rank in the top five within the barbaric race!

A ray of blood red light descended before the city’s entrance, and then it dispersed to reveal Yang Ye’s figure.

Yang Ye looked up at the city, and then a ray of blood red sword energy shot forward.

Hiss!

Bang!

The city exploded apart, and all the experts in the city were stunned!

Meanwhile, a sword howl resounded, and then Yang Ye arrived in the sky above the city. He looked down while countless rays of blood red light flickered incessantly around him. At the same time, all the experts in the city sensed bone piercing slaughter intent.

Bang!

An aura charged up into the sky from within the city, and then a middle aged man appeared before Yang Ye.

The middle aged man glanced at Yang Ye, “May I know who you are?”

Yang Ye asked, “Where’s the Nansi Clan?”

The middle aged man frowned, “Why do you seek my Nansi Clan…?”

Yang Ye asked, “You’re from the Nansi Clan?”

The middle aged man nodded, “I’m an elder of the Nansi Clan, Nansi…”

Hiss

Suddenly, a ray of light flashed, and then the middle aged man’s voice stopped abruptly. A moment of silence ensued before his head fell off his neck.

Countless experts in the city below were shocked by this.

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings from above the city, “Where’s the Nansi Clan?” ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

It was extremely silent as no one answered him!

Hiss!

Meanwhile, a ray of sword energy descended.

Bang!

The entire city shook violently while dust and dirt shot up into the air.

“I’ll ask one last time!” Yang Ye’s voice resounded, “I’ll slaughter the entire city if I can’t find the Nansi Clan!”

Countless experts in the city were shocked when they heard this, and they started fleeing from the city.

Right when Yang Ye was about to swing his sword again, an old man suddenly appeared in front of him.

A Sage!

The old man was a Sage!

The old man stared at Yang Ye, “May I know how my Nansi Clan has offended you?”

Yang Ye walked slowly in the old man’s direction, “I can’t stand the sight of your clan. Is that a good enough reason?”

The old man’s face instantly became extremely unsightly. Suddenly, Yang Ye vanished on the spot, and he was behind the old man when he appeared again.

Bang!

A terrifying aura swept out from the old man, and Yang Ye was pushed over 300m away. However, a sword was in the old man’s head.

Instant annihilation!

A Sage had been instantly annihilated!

The old man stared blankly into the distance as he muttered, “Y-You’re Yang Ye…”

Yang Ye waved his right hand.

Hiss!

The blood red sword instantly flashed over to Yang Ye’s grasp. A moment later, he descended into the city, and then countless shrill cries resounded.

30 breaths of time later, Yang Ye walked out of the city with his blood red sword in hand.

As for the Nansi Clan, it had been wiped out from this world!

After he left the city, Yang Ye flew to the Nanxiu Clan. As soon as he entered the city, over a dozen Sages surrounded him!

It was none other than the Barbaric King who was leading the group!

The same Barbaric King who’d besieged him that day!

The Barbaric King stared at Yang Ye, “Yang Ye, the Barbaric Dimension isn’t a place you should have come to!”

Regardless of whether it was the Barbaric King or the Sages here, all of them were extremely vigilant.

Yang Ye was too monstrous!

Yang Ye nodded slightly, “I planned to go look for all of you, but now it seems like I don’t have to!”

He was about to attack when the Barbaric King suddenly said, “Yang Ye, the Sages of the other races are rushing over here as we speak. It’ll take just a few dozen breaths of time for them to get here. If you leave now, you can still make it. Otherwise…”

“You think I’m afraid?” Yang Ye suddenly spoke ferociously, “Did I fear a hundred Sages?”

As soon as he finished speaking, a ray of blood red sword energy flashed. At the same time, Yang Ye vanished on the spot. In an instant, the sky turned blood red like it was covered in an ocean of blood!

The Barbaric King’s expression changed when he saw Yang Ye attack, and he hurriedly ordered, “Buy time!”

Hiss!

As soon as he said that, the head of a nearby Sage flew up into the air.

The Barbaric King’s expression changed drastically from the sight of this. Meanwhile, another ray of light shot down at him. The Barbaric King didn’t dare to act carelessly, and a huge hammer appeared in his grasp before he slammed it down.

Boom!

In an instant, the entire sky cracked open.

As for the city below, it was blasted apart.

Suddenly, a sword stabbed against the tip of the hammer.

BOOM!

A moment of silence ensued before the hammer exploded apart. An instant later, the blood red sword shot forward while a strand of terrifying sword energy and slaughter intent rippled out.

Bang!

An explosion resounded, and then the Barbaric King was blasted far away!

At the instant that happened, Yang Ye didn’t follow up with another attack. He just flicked his sword forward, and then the head of a Sage over 3km away flew up into the air!

Suppression!

Progenitor Realm slaughter intent suppressed all the Sages here. Coupled with the fact that Yang Ye was a Sage himself, it could be said that ordinary Sages were nothing before him! The Barbaric King had realized that too!

Unless a few dozen Sages converged their strength, Yang Ye was invincible below the Progenitor Realm!

The only known existence capable of fighting Yang Ye while below the Progenitor Realm was An Nanjing. However, An Nanjing was on Yang Ye’s side!

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!

As sword energy surged incessantly, heads flew incessantly as well.

He was slaughtering Sages like they were ants!

Sages couldn’t resist him at all.

The Barbaric King was horrified by the sight of this, and he’d aroused the desire to retreat.

Fear!

Presently, he wasn’t just afraid of Yang Ye, he was terrified of Yang Ye!

Truly terrified!

Yang Ye was much more terrifying than he’d imagined!

Suddenly, Yang Ye appeared behind one of the Sages here. At the same time, his blood red sword appeared before that Sage’s throat. The latter’s body stiffened, and then his head flew up into the air.

At this moment, only the Barbaric King remained here.

Yang Ye looked up at the Barbaric King, “30 breaths of time? 30 breaths have passed. Where’s your reinforcements?”

Reinforcements!

The Barbaric King looked up at the sky, but there was no movement there.

At this moment, he seemed to have realized something and laughed miserably, “Haha! What happened to my barbaric race today will happen to all of you soon.”

As soon as he finished speaking, his aura suddenly rose madly.

Boom!

The Barbaric King’s body exploded apart. At the instant that happened, a terrifying storm of energy swept toward Yang Ye.

Self-detonation!

The Barbaric King had decisively chosen to detonate himself!

Flee?

He couldn’t! Yang Ye was entirely capable of chasing him down now, so he chose to detonate himself.

How terrifying was the explosion created by the detonation of an extraordinary Sage?

The instant the explosion occurred, Yang Ye was blasted extremely far away!

However, Yang Ye was completely unharmed because armor had appeared around him!

The Primordial Armor!

Yang Ye hadn’t been overconfident just now, and he’d used the Primordial Armor. The Primordial Armor had been able to completely resist the energy from the explosion.

Yang Ye sheathed his sword and was about to leave when he seemed to have thought of something, and he waved his right hand. In an instant, the heads of the dead Sages flew toward him, and then he casually waved his hand to make them descend in an orderly manner.

All of those heads were just hanging there on the ruins of the city.

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings, “From today onward, I’ll kill every Sage that appears in the barbaric race. So long as I’m alive, the barbaric race is prohibited from having a Sage!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he transformed into a ray of blood red light that vanished into the sky.

Not long after he left, the space there trembled, and then a group of Sages appeared there.

They were the experts from the Alliance of All!

They were led by the Shaman Emperor!

As he gazed at the heads on the ground below, the Shaman Emperor fell silent, and so did the other Sages.

Yang Ye had fully grown!

He’d truly matured.

Now, no one but progenitors could do anything to him, but Yang Ye’s father had heavily injured all the progenitors who had enmity with him. So, even if they came to the barbaric race’s aid, they would probably be unable to do anything to Yang Ye!

Even if they could kill Yang Ye, they would have to pay a terrible price.

But it was a price that those progenitors were definitely unwilling to pay.

So, who could stop that god of death?

Meanwhile, a Sage suddenly asked, “What did he mean by that?”

The Shaman Emperor looked down at the city below and said, “Revenge, he’s taking revenge. The Barbaric King took part in the attack against him. Now, he's taking revenge on the entire barbaric race.”

He paused for a moment and took a deep breath, “The barbaric race is finished, absolutely finished. From now onward, so long as he’s alive, the barbaric race won’t have another Sage. As for us…”
