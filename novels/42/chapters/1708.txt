Chapter 1709 - Simplify And Combine!

At the instant he opened his eyes, Yang Ye’s sword shot forward.

Stab, flick, chop, swing, slice, sweep…

As far as Qin Jian and Qin Youshui were concerned, Yang Ye was ceaselessly repeating these movements. The speed at which Yang Ye swung his sword was extremely slow. It was so slow that it was like a child using a sword.

However, their expressions were extremely solemn.

Yang Ye’s speed wasn’t slow, it was swift!

When one was swift to the limit, it seemed slow!

In less than a breath of time, Ji Liangchuan’s sword energy had been completely obliterated.

Yang Ye withdrew his sword and stood on the spot as he gazed at Ji Liangchuan, “Do you have other moves?”

Ji Liangchuan gazed at Yang Ye for a long time before he asked, “Why is this happening?!”

Yang Ye’s moves were extraordinarily ordinary. They were so ordinary that even a beginner knew them. Moreover, Yang Ye hadn’t utilized any sword intent. However, it was exactly such ordinary moves that destroyed his saber techniques!

Yang Ye asked, “You want to know?”

Ji Liangchuan nodded.

Yang Ye glanced at his sword and said, “You know… I noticed earlier that I was on the wrong path towards the Sword Dao.”

“The wrong path?” Ji Liangchuan frowned slightly, “What do you mean?”

Yang Ye replied, “It can’t be said to be wrong; I can only be said to have not understood.” He glanced at Ji Liangchuan and continued, “You’re at the Zenith Realm. Regardless of whether it’s your speed or techniques, they’ve arrived at the zenith, right?”

Ji Liangchuan nodded.

Yang Ye said, “You’ve arrived at your own limits. Do you know what’s above your limits?”

Ji Liangchuan said, “The truth!”

Yang Ye nodded, “Do you know what’s the truth?”

Ji Liangchuan fell silent for a moment and replied, “Please do tell.”

Yang Ye replied, “The truth is the quintessence, it’s the original form. Just like my sword, it’s actually just a piece of metal. What’s the true form of metal? Matter. What’s the true form of matter?”

Ji Liangchuan glanced at Yang Ye and said, “Can you make it simpler?!”

Yang Ye nodded slightly, “The most primitive is true! Simply speaking, we should simplify the complicated and seek the quintessence of all things. Just like the sword. For example, sword techniques may vary, but the principle is the same. It’s always the same moves. However, because of innovation, sword techniques started to have numerous variations, and all sorts of flashy sword techniques appeared.”

“Is that bad?” Ji Liangchuan continued, “Some sword techniques are very formidable, right?”

Yang Ye glanced at his sword, “No matter how strong they are, they are still sword techniques. The sword is the core. We should pursue the sword and not sword techniques.” He gazed at Ji Liangchuan and continued, “Because the sword is the foundation!”

Ji Liangchuan lowered his head slightly and seemed to be in deep thought.

He wasn’t the only one. Qin Jian and Qin Youshui were in deep thought too. They seemed to be comprehending what Yang Ye had just said.

Yang Ye took a deep breath, and there was a grin on his face.

He’d gained such comprehension because of the conversation between the Unfettered One and Li Taibai.

Forget!

Both of them spoke about forgetting the Sword Domain. It wasn’t just the Sword Domain, they were also trying to forget other things that were flashy yet not practical. It was like tempering metal. A piece of metal had to be struck thousands of times to remove the impurities within it. Only then would it grow stronger and sharper.

The forgetting that the Unfettered One and Li Taibai spoke of could be considered as the removal of impurities and pursuit of the quintessence of the sword. Or perhaps, it could be said to be the pursuit of the quintessence of all things.

Simplify to seek the truth!

It was what Yang Ye had comprehended. So, he hadn’t utilized any sword techniques or sword intent while fighting Ji Liangchuan, and from now on, he wouldn’t just utilize sword techniques and sword intent in battle as well. The way he thought right now was very simple. It was to forget the techniques he’d learned in the past and start from the beginning!

Forget the Sword Domain, forget the sword techniques, and forget sword intent!

Suddenly, Ji Liangchuan said, “I can kill True Realm experts!”

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts and gazed at Ji Liangchuan, “If I’m not wrong, they can’t be considered as real True Realm experts, right?”

As far as he was concerned, only experts like the Yang Clan’s patriarch could be considered as a real True Realm expert. As for people like Yang Gu and Yang Ling, they were still quite far away from real True Realm experts.

Ji Liangchuan gazed at Yang Ye for a long time and said, “Simplify and pursue the quintessence. The quintessence is the truth… Thank you for your guidance.”

He turned around and started walking away once he finished speaking.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly said, “You’re leaving just like that?”

Ji Liangchuan turned around and gazed at Yang Ye, “I can’t kill you.”

Yang Ye shook his head, “I mean I helped you a little, right?”

Ji Liangchuan nodded, “Yes you did.”

Yang Ye said, “I have a small thing I need your help with. Of course, just forget it if you’re unwilling.”

Ji Liangchuan glanced at Yang Ye and said, “I don’t like owing people favors. Go on, tell me what it is.”

Yang Ye grinned, “It’s nothing. It’s just that I might return to the Yang Clan soon. I’m quite cowardly, so I’d like to get someone to accompany me there.”

Ji Liangchuan’s eyelids twitched. At this moment, he was on the verge of cursing.

Return to the Yang Clan?

Presently, the entire world was aware that the Yang Clan wanted to kill Yang Ye! If Yang Ye was returning, what was he going back for? It was definitely not to have some tea. So, returning with Yang Ye meant that he would have to fight the Yang Clan!

It was a trap!

A huge trap!

At this moment, Ji Liangchuan understood why Yang Ye had been so kind as to explain all of that to him. It was a trap! It was bait!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly said, “Of course, I won’t force you if you don’t want to. But I’m sure you’re aware that a clear conscience is very important, especially for cultivators like us. It’s karma, and the heart and mind won’t be at peace until karma is severed. It’ll be very disadvantageous to your cultivation too. Right, I’m not saying all of that for any specific reason, so don’t take it seriously. I’m just describing it for fun, and I have no other intentions. I promise!”

The corners of Ji Liangchuan’s mouth twitched. He gazed at Yang Ye for a long time and said, “I know. You were just telling that to me for fun. I promise! I know!”

Yang Ye felt speechless.

Meanwhile, Ji Liangchuan suddenly flicked a talisman over to Yang Ye, “I said that I don’t like owing favors. I’ll return the favor that I owe you. That’s a transmission talisman. Crush it when you plan to return to the Yang Clan. I’ll be there.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he turned around and vanished on the spot.

A smile curled up on Yang Ye’s face as he gazed at the transmission talisman. Ji Liangchuan was extremely strong. It could be said that even fighting two True Realm experts wouldn’t be a problem for him.

The Yang Clan!

Yang Ye’s face turned gloomy when he thought of the Yang Clan. He’d naturally not forgotten what the Yang Clan had done to him, and he was determined to get his revenge.

As a man, he had to repay his debts and take revenge if there was enmity!

However, he wasn’t that foolish as to go against the Yang Clan on his own, nor could he accomplish that. Not to mention anything else, just the Yang Clan’s patriarch, Yang Xiao, wasn’t someone he could defeat. If he didn’t use the Wargod’s arm, he wouldn’t even be able to fight Yang Xiao!

So, he had to get help! Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Help!

Yang Ye suddenly gazed at Qin Jian and Qin Youshui. Their eyelids twitched when they saw him look at them.

Yang Ye said, “What I said earlier was helpful to the both of you too, right?”

Qin Jian exchanged glances with his sister. In the end, he said, “Brother Yang, I’m sorry. We’re very grateful for the guidance that you’ve provided, but we can’t go to the Yang Clan with you. It’s not that we’re afraid, but we’re members of the Qin Clan. If we go with you, it’s very likely that it’ll cause the Yang Clan and the Qin Clan’s relationship to turn hostile. So…”

Yang Ye smiled, “I understand, and I won’t ask you to go to the Yang Clan with me. What I wanted to say is… Do you know why Ji Liangchuan’s attainments in the Sword Dao is stronger than both of you?”

Yang Ye didn’t wait for them to answer him and continued, “Because of the shackles on you. Both of your hearts are shackled. It’s an invisible shackle. Just like this very moment, both of you really want to help me, but you have to consider your clan and choose not to help. Sword cultivators aren’t cultivating the sword, but the heart. If the heart is in shackles, the sword is in shackles. If the sword is in shackles, you won’t be able to draw your sword when you need to. That’s why your swords aren’t as swift and powerful as Ji Liangchuan. It’s because your hearts and swords are bound.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye turned around and walked towards the palace.

Qin Jian and Qin Youshui remained silent on the spot. A long time passed before Qin Youshui said, “Brother, what he said really does make sense!”

Qin Jian laughed bitterly, “I know. But what can we do about it? It wasn’t easy for the clan to foster us. Even if we don’t make any great contributions to the clan, we can’t cause trouble for the clan, right?”

Qin Youshui remained silent for a long time before she said, “If the heart is bound, we hesitate before drawing our swords. Once we hesitate, how can it be quick?!” She gazed at the palace at this point and continued, “Brother, did you see? Both Ji Liangchuan and Yang Ye’s swords are extremely swift! They’re much swifter than both of us.”

Qin Jian fell silent.

A short while passed before Qin Youshui shook her head, “Let’s go!”

It didn’t take long for them to leave Phoenix Cry Mountain.

After he entered the palace, Yang Ye immediately entered the Primordial Pagoda and went to the cultivation room on the 3rd level.

Simplify!

He’d learned too many sword and fist techniques. He naturally had no intention to discard all of them. His goal was to combine all of them, and then simplify them. His goal was to make them simpler and purer!

It wasn’t just his sword techniques and fist techniques that he intended to simplify. He also intended to simplify the Laws he’d comprehended.

In the past, his sword had been too complicated, and he’d learned too many miscellaneous things.

So, he intended to simplify and combine everything he knew!
