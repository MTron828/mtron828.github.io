Chapter 1890 – Upper Universe! I’m Here!

The armored man was quite strong. He was at the Enlightened Realm at least!

However, he’d just come down here. So, he’d definitely gone through the chaotic flow of space, and it could be said that he was at his weakest.

Coupled with the fact that he hadn’t had his guard up against Yang Ye, so Yang Ye had killed him in an instant.

Everyone glanced at Yang Ye in silence.

Needless to say, there was a thought in all their minds, and it was to never rashly offend that madman. It wasn’t that they feared him, they just really didn’t want to offend him. Because he was an utterly rash fellow!

Yang Ye paid no attention to the armored man’s corpse, and he looked up at the barrier of light instead.

A sword howl resounded, and then a ray of light tore through the sky.

Everyone watched as a gap was sliced open on the barrier.

“Let’s go!” Gu Ya’s voice resounded abruptly, and then all of them flashed into the rift in the barrier.

Two breaths of time later, the rift gradually healed.

A short while later, a black robed man appeared here.

The Candle Dragon immediately showed himself again once the black robed man arrived.

The Candle Dragon gazed at the black robed man while fear filled his eyes, “Who are you?!”

The black robed man spoke indifferently, “A dignified ancient beast is actually willing to submit to the sky race. What a humiliation!”

The Candle Dragon’s face instantly became vicious. At the same time, the black robed man waved his right hand.

Bam!

The Candle Dragon was blasted away, and a huge black palm print appeared on his head.

At this moment, the Candle Dragon was astounded!

Such an existence was in this medium universe?

The black robed man glanced at the Candle Dragon, “I’ll give your old master some face and spare you!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he looked up at the barrier of light, and then he waved his right hand lightly.

Hiss!

The barrier of light was torn open, and a ray of light entered it.

Around 15 minutes later, a ray of golden light appeared here, and then a golden rod shot up into the sky.

Bang!

A large hole was instantly blasted open in the barrier of light, and then a ray of light entered it.

It didn’t take long for the sky to return to normal.

However, as soon as it healed, a woman suddenly strode through the air. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

The woman wore a moon white dress. Her beautiful hair was tied up above her head, and she had an extremely gorgeous and rosy face. However, her countenance was slightly pale.

She looked up at the sky, “You still went up there…?”

A breath of time later, the barrier of light was split open, and a white shadow flashed through it.

The surroundings became calm once more.

Meanwhile, the Candle Dragon’s head suddenly emerged from the clouds. He looked up at the sky and said, “Who the heck are they?”

…

The chaotic flow of space!

At this moment, Yang Ye and the others were experiencing the chaotic flow of space.

It was impossible to see the end of the boundless reaches of space. Powerful waves of energy frequently surged around Yang Ye and the others. The energy was extremely powerful, and even Yang Ye didn’t dare to use his physical body to resist it directly.

Because even his body wouldn’t be able to last for long!

Everyone here had an extremely solemn expression on their face, and they didn’t dare underestimate the danger around them.

“Be careful!” Meanwhile, Gu Ya said, “The chaotic flow of space isn’t the most dangerous thing here. The most dangerous thing here is the spatial rifts. These spatial rifts are linked to unknown places, and you’ll be instantly torn apart upon entering one of them.”

Spatial rifts!

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings. In this world that was quite dim, he saw numerous rifts scattered around the area.

“He's right!” Meanwhile, Hou Qing’s voice resounded in Yang Ye’s mind, “Kid, these spatial rifts are no jokes. The energy within them isn’t just able to destroy your body, even our main bodies can’t resist them.”

Yang Ye nodded. He could sense that the energy within them was indeed capable of obliterating him!

Meanwhile, Gu Ya suddenly said, “Everyone, stay close. It’s best if we join forces and stay united for now. Otherwise, we’re all doomed!”

As he spoke, he purposely glanced at Yang Ye and Qian Xie.

Yang Ye shrugged, “I won’t attack him if he doesn’t attack me!”

Qian Xie glanced coldly at Yang Ye and didn’t say a word.

Just like that, they joined forces and moved forward. While they didn’t encounter numerous powerful waves of chaotic space, they were able to jointly defend themselves. So, while they did face danger, they were able to overcome it. However, at this moment, they’d realized how powerful the chaotic space here was, and they didn’t dare underestimate it in the slightest.

“Be careful!” Suddenly, Gu Ya’s voice resounded, and it was filled with seriousness.

Everyone looked up, and they saw a black vortex around 3km away from them. Lightning was flashing incessantly within it.

“The spatial vortex!” Meanwhile, Gu Ya explained, “We’ll be within the upper universe once we go through it. However, it won’t be easy. See the lightning over there? They are heavenly lightning. We’ll be obliterated if they hit us!”

Obliterated!

Everyone had solemn expressions on their faces. A short while later, Gu Ya made them speed up. The closer they got to the black vortex, the more solemn their expressions were. Even Yang Ye had an extremely solemn expression on his face.

Danger!

Just like everyone else, he sensed danger too!

He didn’t dare act carelessly, and the profound energy within him surged. It didn’t take long for them to enter the black vortex.

Rumble!

Lightning rumbled around them.

At this moment, all of them revealed their respective skills. Yang Ye closed his eyes while an ethereal sword appeared beneath his feet. At the same time, 10 ethereal swords flickered incessantly around him and blocked away the lightning.

It was fine in the beginning because his swords could resist the lightning, but as time passed, he noticed that the lightning was growing stronger, and his swords were starting to be unable to persist. Yang Ye had no choice but to activate the Sword Domain.

His trembling swords instantly calmed down once the Sword Domain enveloped them. At the same time, the light they emanated grew sharper.

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings. He noticed that everyone else was able to resist the heavenly lightning. Especially the woman in a red dress. Red light flickered around her, and the heavenly lightning were instantly obliterated upon coming into contact with them!

The heavenly lightning didn’t affect her at all!

Strong!

At this moment, her strength wasn’t the same as when he’d first met her.

Suddenly, the woman in a red dress gazed at him, and then she immediately withdrew her gaze.

Yang Ye withdrew his gaze as well, and then he sped up.

A long time later, all of them saw sunlight.

“We’re almost there!” Gu Ya’s voice resounded, and all of them sped up.

Around 15 minutes later, the thunderclaps grew softer and softer until finally vanishing.

Finally, they stopped.

All of them opened their eyes.

A blue sky and white clouds. That was what all of them saw, and a calm vortex was behind them.

It was the passageway to the lower universe!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly asked, “This is the upper universe?”

Gu Ya nodded, “It is.” He paused for a moment and continued, “Everyone, the true danger begins now. Good luck.”

All of them were puzzled. Suddenly, numerous powerful auras appeared in the sky, and it made their expressions change.

The Enlightened Realm!

True Enlightened Realm experts!

It didn’t take long for five people to appear in the sky. They were led by a yellow robed middle aged man who held a dragon seal.

The middle aged man glanced at them and said, “Who’s Yang Ye?”

Yang Ye!

Yang Ye eyes drooped. No one knew what he was thinking.

As for the gazes of everyone here, it had descended upon Yang Ye.

The middle aged man gazed at Yang Ye, “Hand over the Sovereign of Man’s sword and I’ll keep your corpse intact!”

A moment of silence ensued, and then Yang Ye withdrew the holy sword. Right when everyone thought Yang Ye would give it up, Yang Ye looked up at the middle aged man, “Actually, I never intended to take this sword for myself. I never forcefully take what doesn’t belong to me. However…”

A ferocious expression covered his face at this point, “However, I’m telling you right now! You want this sword? You can have it. Tell the Sovereign of Man to fucking kneel before me and I’ll give it to him, alright?”

“How dare you!” The middle aged man was furious, and he slammed the dragon seal at Yang Ye.

Roar!

A dragon roar resounded, and then a huge golden dragon flashed out from the seal and emanated a terrifying pressure as it slammed down towards Yang Ye.

Everyone around Yang Ye moved aside.

Yang Ye looked up at the huge golden dragon with a fearless gaze in his eyes. When it arrived around 300m away from him, three ethereal swords suddenly appeared in front of Yang Ye.

In an instant, mysterious energy appeared in the surroundings.

The Sword Domain!

Yang Ye would naturally not act carelessly when facing someone who was at a higher realm of cultivation.

A moment later, three rays of light shot up into the sky. They seemed like they were about to tear open the sky, and everyone watched as they sliced the golden dragon into bits.

The middle aged man was furious, “How dare you!”

Suddenly, Yang Ye vanished on the spot, and he was in front of the middle aged man when he appeared again.

After that, a sword sheath appeared in Yang Ye’s grasp. The holy sword’s sheath, and the holy sword was within it.

Yang Ye grabbed the sword’s hilt and drew it.

Heavenrend!

This time, Yang Ye overlapped almost 70 Heavenrends!

A powerful wave of energy pushed Gu Ya and the others back repeatedly.

The middle aged man’s expression changed drastically when he saw it, and he tossed the dragon seal at Yang Ye.

However, as soon as Yang Ye’s sword was swung, the dragon seal was instantly sliced into two, and the middle aged man’s figure stiffened on the spot.

Hiss!

An instant later, the middle aged man’s body split open from the center, and his internal organs sprayed out. It was an absolutely bloody sight.

Yang Ye sheathed his sword, took a deep breath, and then looked up into the sky, “Upper universe! I, Yang Ye, am here! Tremble before me!”
