Chapter 1969 – Six Slaughters of the Weapon Dao!

Steal!

Yang Ye really hadn’t done that for many years, because nowadays, there were truly few things that could make him covet it.

Would a rich man rob a beggar?

Yet now, Yang Ye had no choice but to go back to his old ways.

Because he felt that he was quite poor!

A’Man glanced at Yang Ye and said, “They aren’t ordinary.”

“I know!” Yang Ye turned around and gazed at the forest. Meanwhile, the forest split apart, and a group emerged from within.

Four people!

They were led by a middle aged man, and he held a folding fan. An old man, a woman, and a black robed figure were by his side.

All of them were Know Dao Realm experts!

Based on their respective forces, it was obvious that Yang Ye’s side was at a complete disadvantage because only A’Man was a Hear Dao Realm expert!

The middle aged man led the others over to around 300m away from Yang Ye’s group, and a slight smile curled up on his face when he noticed the realms of cultivation that Yang Ye and the others possessed.

The middle aged man was about to speak when Yang Ye’s figure suddenly shook, and then he appeared just around 10m away from the middle aged man.

An instant later, a wave of mysterious energy appeared here.

The Sword Domain!

The Sword Domain instantly enveloped them. At the same time, 36 ethereal swords appeared around them.

“Die!” Yang Ye shouted.

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!

In an instant, rays of light crisscrossed, and the forest was instantly obliterated.

The Invincible Sword Domain!

Yang Ye had immediately utilized the Invincible Sword Domain, and it was naturally for the sake of taking them by surprise!

The rays of sword energy crisscross and sliced through everything incessantly. Ripples surged out from amidst the sword energy, and this continued for almost 15 minutes before the sword energy gradually vanished.

At this moment, all four of them were still standing.

However, they looked quite miserable.

The middle aged man who led the group had lost his arms, and his entire body was covered in injuries. The others by his side were in a worse state. Especially the old man amongst them, half of his face was gone.

Heavily injured!

While Yang Ye’s sword formation hadn’t been able to instantly kill them, it had heavily injured them in an instant.

Yang Ye wasn’t in a good state as well. The resistance they put up to stay alive had shaken his Sword Domain, causing him to suffer a certain amount of damage. However, it wasn’t life threatening. But it was clearly impossible for him to use the Invincible Sword Domain again right now!

Yang Ye gazed at A’Man and Ling, “What are you two standing there for?! Attack!”

A'Man glanced at him and didn’t hesitate to charge forward.

Ling followed closely behind her!

Yang Ye sat cross-legged on the ground and started to recover with Primordial Violet Energy.

Yang Ye didn’t pay any attention to A’Man and the others. They were heavily injured, so A’Man and Ling’s strength were sufficient to deal with those fellows.

Around half an hour later, the surroundings suddenly fell silent.

At this moment, Yang Ye had almost fully recovered.

Meanwhile, A’Man arrived before Yang Ye, “Two of them escaped!”

Two escaped!

Yang Ye nodded slightly. If experts at this level were determined to flee, then it would be really difficult to kill them.

Meanwhile, A’Man flicked 12 immortal crystals to Yang Ye, “We got these from the other two we killed. There were a total of 36 immortal crystals, so these 12 are yours. Don’t refuse and take them!”

As she finished speaking, her voice carried a tone that allowed no refusal.

Yang Ye didn’t refuse. He took them and asked, “Big Sis, are you really in need of immortal crystals?”

A’Man replied, “Everyone needs them. However, I’m also here to temper myself. This place allows me to feel a sense of danger, and I dare not relax at all.”

As she spoke, she glanced at the surroundings, “Let me take you to a place!”

She immediately flashed off into the distance once she finished speaking.

Yang Ye and Ling quickly followed after her.

Around an hour later, A’Man suddenly stopped.

There was a huge sword in front of them!

The sword was around 300m long and over 100m wide. They simply seemed tiny like ants before it!

There was a huge character inscribed in the center of it.

‘兵’!

There was a damaged wall behind the huge sword, and it was obvious from that damaged wall that this place was extremely grand in the past.

Yang Ye gazed at A’Man and asked, “What’s this place?”

A’Man spoke in a low voice, “I’m not too sure. I may be a sect of the past. Come, let’s go in and have a look!”

She walked in first.

A scene of desolation covered the surroundings.

It didn’t take long for her to lead them to an old and damaged hall. A huge stone sword floated at the end of it, and it was floating with its tip facing the ground. It seemed like it was suppressing something.

There was only a single statue in the hall.

It was the statue of a middle aged man. The man was looking ahead with his hands behind his back, and a sword without a sheath was hanging by his waist.

Slaughter intent!

For some reason, Yang Ye sensed a strand of horrifying slaughter intent!

The Weapon Path!

Yang Ye felt that the man before him was a member of the Weapon Path.

Suddenly, Snowy’s head emerged from beneath his shirt.

A’Man and Ling immediately looked at Snowy!

Ling spoke solemnly, “A Sprite Lord!”

Yang Ye glanced at Ling, “You recognize her?”

Ling glanced at Snowy and nodded slightly, “My spirit race has one. What… what is she doing with you?”

Yang Ye smiled, “It’s a long story!”

Ling nodded and didn’t say anything. He just shot another glance at Snowy.

Yang Ye rubbed Snowy’s head, “What is it?”

Snowy hadn’t come out since he arrived here because it was a place without spirit energy, so she truly disliked it.

Snowy pointed towards the right.

Yang Ye was delighted when he saw this because Snowy had definitely sensed something. He immediately asked, “What’s over there?”

Snowy bit on her claw and thought for a moment, and then she started waving it swiftly.

This time, even Yang Ye couldn’t understand her.

Yang Ye rubbed her head and smiled, “What the heck are you saying?”

Snowy shrugged and revealed a helpless expression.

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment, and then he gazed at A’Man and Ling, “Let’s head over and have a look!”

They glanced at Snowy and nodded.

Snowy led them out of the hall and towards the right. This journey continued for an hour before they finally stopped.

There was a small mountain in front of them, and there was nothing special about it. Only the mountain wall was extremely smooth like a mirror.

Snowy pointed at the mountain wall.

Yang Ye asked, “There’s something in there?”

Snowy blinked and shrugged.

It meant that she didn’t know.

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

Meanwhile, A’Man suddenly walked over to the wall and patted it lightly with her right hand. After that, she gazed at Yang Ye, “There’s nothing in there.”

Snowy flew over to the wall and patted it lightly with her paw.

Nothing happened!

After that, she sniffed it slightly, gazed at Yang Ye, and then pointed at the wall.

Yang Ye hurriedly asked, “There’s something there?”

Snowy shook her head!

Yang Ye’s face darkened. Is she playing a trick on me?

Meanwhile, Snowy patted the wall lightly and gazed at Yang Ye.

This time, Yang Ye understood what she meant.

The wall wasn’t ordinary!

Yang Ye walked over to it, glanced at it, and then slowly placed his right palm on it.

In an instant, Yang Ye’s expression changed.

Blood red!

Yang Ye’s eyes had instantly turned blood red, and the slaughter intent within him swept out madly and surged into the wall.

A’Man and Ling’s expressions changed at the sight of this, and they moved back slightly.

Yang Ye’s slaughter intent was ceaselessly surging into the mountain wall. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Yang Ye slowly closed his eyes, and then he appeared in a gray and hazy world.

While he looked around at the surroundings, a middle aged man appeared before him.

The middle aged man was the same man whom Yang Ye had seen in the hall!

The middle aged man looked Yang Ye in the eyes, “The weapon is a path of cunning and slaughter. My Weapon Path is an unyielding and courageous path. Only those who submit before us may survive. Are you willing to inherit my Weapon Path’s inheritance?”

The Weapon Path’s inheritance? Yang Ye was stunned and shook his head, “Senior, I’ve inherited the Dao Path!” He was a member of the Dao Path, so he naturally couldn’t inherit the Weapon Path.

“So what?” The middle aged man continued, “You’re courageous and unyielding, and you possess the aura of slaughter. You even possess the Heart of Slaughter. You’re perfect for my Weapon Path. Now, I’ll give you the Weapon Dao Compilation and the Six Slaughters of the Weapon Dao!”

He didn’t even give Yang Ye time to refuse before information suddenly appeared in Yang Ye’s mind.

“The Six Slaughters of the Weapon Dao—Slaughter man, slaughter the earth, slaughter the sky, slaughter all things, slaughter the heart, slaughter oneself!”

A long time passed before Yang Ye opened his eyes, and he gazed at the middle aged man, “Senior, I’m from the Dao Path…”

“I don’t care!” The middle aged man waved his hand, “Since you were able to get in here and meet me, it means we were destined to meet. It’s the destiny that your Dao Path believes in. Remember that the Weapon Path has six lines. Our line was completely annihilated because of a stupid mistake my senior brother made. We must take revenge for that. I can’t do it, so I’ll leave it to you!”

Yang Ye was stunned speechless.

Meanwhile, the middle aged man added, “Even though the Weapon Progenitor was at wrong too, it isn’t completely his fault. Moreover, you can’t defeat him anyway. So, don’t try to take revenge from him. Your target is that bastard who calls himself the Weapon Immortal. Just for the sake of seizing a position of superiority in the Weapon Path, he used the time the Weapon Progenitor wasn’t there to plot against our line. You just have to kill him!”

Yang Ye asked in a low voice, “How strong is that fellow?”

The middle aged man replied, “Above the Sage Realm!”

Yang Ye hurriedly said, “I can’t defeat him!”

The middle aged man spoke indifferently, “That’s your problem!”

“Fuck you!” Yang Ye flared up, “I don’t want your fucking inheritance! Go look for someone else!”
