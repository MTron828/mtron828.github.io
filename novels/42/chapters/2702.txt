Chapter 2703 – Come Over Here!

One-on-one!

Yang Ye sat cross-legged in the wooden house, and a small formation diagram was in front of him.

It was a formation, a formation that protected the Destiny Dimension.

The woman in black had left it here!

Because the Destiny Dimension didn’t have one previously. After all, why would there be a need for one when she was here?

It was something she’d intentionally left for him!

Snowy curiously scanned the formation diagram from Yang Ye’s shoulder. She pointed at it to say that she wanted to play with it.

Yang Ye rubbed Snowy’s head and smiled, “You can’t. We’ll all be finished if you spoil it.”

Snowy blinked and nodded.

She was very obedient to Yang Ye.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye seemed to have thought of something and gazed at Snowy, “Have you done what I asked?”

Snowy hurriedly nodded and waved her paws swiftly.

Yang Ye pinched her little cheeks, “Little fellow, you better be reliable this time. Otherwise, we’ll both be dead today.”

Snowy cracked a smile, hugged Yang Ye’s hand, and rubbed it lightly.

Yang Ye’s eyes were full of tender affection.

Actually, he wished Snowy was just an ordinary sprite.

Because she could have a happier life that way.

Well, not completely. If she were just an ordinary sprite, she wouldn’t be able to swagger off everywhere, nor could she get whatever she wanted!

So, it was better for her to just be like this.

…

Outside the Destiny Dimension, Mo Yu had an extremely unsightly expression on his face, “There’s a formation here, and it’s a defensive one. It’s definitely that woman in black who left it here.”

Heng Wangu nodded slightly, “It seems they’ve given him a way out.”

First God glanced at the Destiny Dimension and asked, “Shall we force our way through?”

Suddenly, Mo Yu said, “Let me fight him one-on-one!”

Heng Wangu and First God gazed at him, and First God laughed coldly, “Allow me to be honest but haha…”

His laughter was full of ridicule.

Mo Yu spoke coldly, “Why don’t you go then?”

First God laughed coldly, “Do you think I’m afraid of him?”

Mo Yu shrugged, “Then go on!”

First God’s eyes narrowed slightly, and then he suddenly started laughing, “Why would I do? So I can bully the weak? That isn’t my style. You and him are juniors, so it’s best if you go fight him.”

Mo Yu glanced coldly at First God and didn’t say anything.

Meanwhile, Heng Wangu suddenly asked, “Are you confident?”

He was naturally asking Mo Yu!

Mo Yu fell silent for a moment and laughed coldly, “They say he’s the number one expert in the younger generation. While we’re not from the same era, I do want to see if the number one in this era of his or the number one in my era is better!”

He walked forward as he spoke.

He had been the number one expert in the younger generation of his era!

After all, he’d been chosen by Destiny!

Heng Wangu watched Mo Yu leave in silence.

Suddenly, Zuo Mu said, “He won’t win!”

Heng Wangu nodded slightly, “Don’t let him die. He’s very useful to us!”

Zuo Mu nodded.

First God laughed coldly, “Do both of you think so little of him?”

Heng Wangu shook his head, “If it were in the past, he may have a chance against Yang Ye, but now… His mental state isn’t the same anymore, and his heart has been filled by envy, rage of abandonment, and unwillingness. His Sword Heart isn’t the same anymore.”

He gazed at the Destiny Realm and continued, “Yang Ye’s Sword Heart is still the same, and most importantly, he’s a ruthless person.”

Ruthless!

First God grunted coldly but did not refute it.

He hadn’t had much contact with Yang Ye, but he did know a little about Yang Ye, and he knew Yang Ye was a ruthless person.Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Mo Yu wasn’t fearsome when compared to Yang Ye!

Mo Yu walked over to the Destiny Dimension and spoke indifferently, “Yang Ye, didn’t you want a one-on-one battle? Come outside! I’ll do it!”

A moment of silence ensued, and then Yang Ye’s voice came from within the Destiny Dimension, “Come inside!”

Mo Yu’s face turned unsightly, “Yang Ye, are you coming out or not?”

Yang Ye laughed coldly, “What would I do if you gang up on me once I go out there? Come inside and we can fight fairly. I’m all alone here. If you’re afraid, you can ask the others to take your place!”

Mo Yu’s face turned quite gloomy.

First God suddenly chuckled coldly, “What is it? Scared?”

Mo Yu glanced coldly at First God, “I’m not like someone who runs away like a rat runs from a cat upon catching sight of Destiny.”

He vanished into the distance once he finished speaking. A vortex suddenly appeared in the distance, and Mo Yu entered it.

First God’s face was icy cold to the extreme.

First God naturally knew that Mo Yu was speaking about him. He had returned to the End World in a sorry state after Destiny took an arm of his in the Martial Sky World!

Meanwhile, Heng Wangu suddenly said, “There’s no need to get angry. Zuo Mu and I wouldn’t have done any better in front of her.”

First God’s face gradually returned to normal.

In the Destiny Dimension.

Mo Yu went over to the wooden house. Meanwhile, Yang Ye gazed at Snowy, “Stay here and replenish its spirit energy. Don’t be naughty, and don’t do anything rash. Just replenish the formation’s spirit energy in here. I’ll be back soon, alright?”

Snowy glanced at the formation and shook her head to indicate that it wasn’t a problem.

Yang Ye pinched her cheek and said, “You’re my assistant now, so don’t ever do anything rash, and don’t give it too much spirit energy either. Otherwise, this formation won’t be able to endure it, and then this place will explode from that. If that happens, the woman in black will never forgive us!”

The women in black!

Snowy obviously remembered her, so she immediately nodded to display that she wouldn’t do anything rash!

Yang Ye would never just trust the little fellow, of course. So, he summoned Zi’er to watch Snowy.

Snowy immediately pounced into Zi’er’s arms and started rubbing her head against Zi’er.

Zi’er gazed at Yang Ye, “Be careful!”

Yang Ye smiled, “Of course!”

He left the wooden house and went over to Mo Yu.

Mo Yu was holding the fiery red sword!

Yang Ye sized up Mo Yu and said, “Looks like you have fully recovered to your prime.”

Mo Yu waved his sword, Crimson Sky, and said, “I’ll show her that she was blind to choose you.”

Yang Ye grinned, “You know… Seeing you makes me think of a saying—those loved unconditionally have nothing to fear.”

He shook his head and continued, “Let’s not waste our breaths. Since you’re a sword cultivator and her own personal disciple, why don’t we compete in the sword? Just sword technique alone?”

Mo Yu smiled, “Alright!”

A battle between sword cultivators!

Mo Yu pointed his sword toward the ground at an angle and gazed at Yang Ye with a smile on his face, “She taught me a few moves, and she said the sword techniques of the world don’t go beyond those moves. I’ll let you have a taste of them now. Draw your sword!”

Yang Ye smiled, “Then I won’t hold back.”

Yang Ye was already in front of Mo Yu when he finished speaking.

Mo Yu suddenly twisted his body to the side, and a sword slashed past his nose. If he’d been just a moment slower, the sword would have sliced him into two.

This movement of his had allowed him to dodge Yang Ye’s attack. At the same time, he spun himself on the spot and arrived on Yang Ye’s left. After that, he took his sword in both hands and slashed down at Yang Ye’s shoulder!

The entire string of movements was completed in one fluid motion!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye had reacted at the instant his attack missed. His sword switched to a horizontal swipe at Crimson Sky.

Bam!

They immediately split apart.

At the instant they were pushed back, Crimson Sky left Mo Yu’s grasp and shot at Yang Ye. At the same time, he vanished on the spot.

Yang Ye gazed at the sword and didn’t counterattack!

His sword moved when Crimson Sky arrived just half an inch away from his forehead.

Striking last!

At the instant he swung his sword, Mo Yu’s right hand had just grabbed Crimson Sky, and Yang Ye’s sword struck its hilt. In this way, it was like the instant Mo Yu had intentionally allowed Yang Ye to stab him upon grabbing his sword.

Hiss!

Blood sprayed!

Mo Yu reacted quickly, and he immediately abandoned his sword and moved 300m back.

However, he left a few fingers behind.

Yang Ye took a step forward and grabbed Crimson Sky, and it immediately started shaking violently.

It was resisting!

Countless rays of sword energy and sword intent surged out incessantly from it and tried to attack Yang Ye!

Yang Ye gazed at Crimson Sky and laughed coldly as he casually tossed it into the wooden house. Snowy was in there!

Crimson Sky was just about to flee when Snowy grabbed it!

However, Crimson Sky was still resisting.

Snowy blinked and slapped it.

Bam!

Crimson Sky shook violently but Snowy grunted lightly while waving her little paw rapidly. She’d slapped it too hard, and it hurt her!

Zi’er rolled her eyes at Snowy, and then she took Snowy’s paw and blew on it.

Meanwhile, Snowy glanced at Crimson Sky. It was about to flee but numerous swords suddenly aimed themselves at it.

The five element swords, the Sword Precursor, Sword Supreme… All of them were pointed at Crimson Sky, and the sword intent and sword energy it emanated was completely devoured by these swords.

Snowy gazed at Crimson Sky and waved her paw. She was saying that it had hurt her! And she was asking what it planned to do about that!

Crimson Sky felt absolutely aggrieved. After all, it was Snowy who had hit it!

Outside the wooden house.

Mo Yu’s face was extremely gloomy when Crimson Sky was taken from him. At the same time, Yang Ye walked slowly in Mo Yu’s direction, “I think it’s time to end this.”

Suddenly, Mo Yu pressed his hands together and pushed them apart, “Lend me your sword!”

As soon as he said that, the space before him was sliced open, and then a sword shot out from there.

Heaven Executor!

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly, “Heaven Executor, you have a consciousness of your own. So, I’ll give you a chance. Fuck off right now. Otherwise, I’ll obliterate your sword sprite!”

Meanwhile, Snowy appeared on Yang Ye’s shoulder. She glanced at Heaven Executor, and then she withdrew Crimson Sky. Crimson Sky was still trembling and resisting.

Snowy suddenly grabbed Crimson Sky on both ends, and then she pulled.

Crack!

Crimson Sky was instantly broken into two!

Sorrowful sword howls resounded incessantly from it!

Snowy tossed both pieces to the ground, pointed at Heaven Executor, and then waved at it. She was telling it to come over to her!

A moment of silence ensued, and then Heaven Executor suddenly returned to the pitch black hole in space and vanished.

Mo Yu was stunned speechless.
