Chapter 803 – Divine Lightning Of Obliteration!

Translator: InVader

Editor: Conspiracing

It was the first time Yang Ye had seen Qin Bufan so panic stricken. No, it should be described as terrified. There was dense terror in Qin Bufan’s eyes.

Yang Ye looked up into the sky. The dark violet lightning didn’t descend swiftly like the pillars of lightning from before, and it slowly emerged from the vortex instead.

An extremely terrifying pressure appeared here!

It pressed down upon everyone like a myriad of mountains, and it didn’t just make their figures tremble, even their souls started trembling. It was a form of terror that came from the depths of their souls and bones.

Half-Saints were in a comparatively better state, but the profounders beneath the Half-Saint Realm were worse. Many even fell weakly to the ground.

Yang Ye was affected as well. He hurriedly emanated his sword intent to envelop himself and resist the terrifying pressure from the dark violet lightning.

“What’s Lightning of Obliteration?” Yang Ye had a solemn expression in his eyes as he gazed at the dark violet divine lightning.

“Lightning of Obliteration is lightning utilized to obliterate the world!” Qin Bufan explained, “If it descends into this world, then the entire continent will definitely be obliterated in an instant. Such lightning doesn’t even appear for a few tens of thousands of years throughout the boundless cosmos. I never expected it to actually appear here.”

When he spoke up to this point, Qin Bufan cursed, “I can’t figure this out. While a Heaven Dao was killed here and so were countless other people, it isn’t to the extent of making that fellow send Lightning of Obliteration down upon this world. Could it be that something in this world poses a threat to it? And that thing made it not hesitate to send down Lightning of Obliteration to obliterate it?”

“What or who can pose a threat to it?” asked Yang Ye.

Qin Bufan shook his head, “I don’t know. Such lightning rarely appears. Let me explain it like this. There was once a world where someone slaughtered billions to refine a precious treasure, but even then, the Heaven Dao didn’t send down Lightning of Obliteration, and it only sent down other powerful types of lightning of calamity. Lightning of Obliteration is usually only utilized when it feels threatened. Who exactly is so powerful to make it feel threatened?”

When he spoke up to this point, he suddenly gazed at Yang Ye and said, “It isn’t you, right?”

The corners of Yang Ye’s mouth twitched, “What do you think?”

Qin Bufan said, “Right, while you are heaven defying, I’d never believe that you’re able to pose a threat to the Heaven Dao of the Outer Heavens! It’s fine, let’s just watch. That lightning will descend towards the person that can pose a threat to the Heaven Dao. Let me see who is that formidable to actually pose a threat to the Heaven Dao of the Outer Heavens!”

“I’m really curious as well!” Yang Ye nodded.

As soon as it appeared in the sky, it stopped for a moment in midair as if it was looking for something. It didn’t take long for it to move once more, and it slowly descended towards a certain position on the ground.

A strange scene appeared in the sky once it started descending. The powerful energy it contained caused even the air to instantly explode apart, and numerous terrifying explosions resounded through the sky. Moreover, space was even warped by the powerful pressure it emanated!

Everyone watched as the dark violet bolt of lightning descended. In the beginning, they weren’t able to discern who it targeted, but it didn’t take long for them to realize that it was falling towards Yang Ye’s group.

The others around Yang Ye hurriedly moved aside, and it didn’t take long for only Elder Mu, Yin’yin, and Qin Bufan to remain by his side.

Qin Bufan suddenly said, “Who do you think it’s targeting?” Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Yang Ye gazed at Elder Mu and Lu Yan. Both of them nodded slightly, and then they moved aside. However, the Lightning of Obliteration didn’t change its trajectory and still continued down towards Yang Ye’s group of 3!

Qin Bufan gazed at Yang Ye and said, “I bet that it’s definitely aimed at you. If it isn’t, then I’ll fight it myself!” As he spoke, his figure moved towards the side as well.

The bolt of lightning still continued on the same path of descent!

At this moment, everyone understood that it was aimed at Yang Ye!

All of them gazed at him.

Actually, Yang Ye was quite stunned, and he felt wronged. After all, while he felt that his strength really was not bad and could even rival a high-grade Half-Saint, but it was bullshit to say that he could pose a threat to the Heaven Dao of the Outer Heavens. Because the Heaven Dao of the Outer Heavens was something that could even kill Saint Realm experts!

“Are you mistaken?” Yang Ye gulped down a mouthful of saliva while he looked at the approaching bolt of violet divine lightning.

It continued its descent.

A ferocious glow flashed through Yang Ye’s eyes. He patted Yin’yin on the shoulder, and then pushed her away from himself. After that, a sword appeared in his grasp. He pointed it at the sky and shouted, “If a mortal offends me, then I’ll kill that person; if the heavens offend me, then I’ll defy the heavens! I....”

Yang Ye’s voice stopped abruptly while everyone else here was stunned as well. Because it was actually moving, and it arrived above Yin’yin!

Everyone here came to a sudden understanding, and they realized that the little girl was its target!

Yang Ye was stunned and so was Qin Bufan. Meanwhile, Yin’yin blinked innocently....

“Do I really have to fight it on my own?” Qin Bufan gulped down a mouthful of saliva while cold sweat appeared on his forehead, “I really can’t fight that thing!”

Elder Mu and Lu Yan instantly heaved sighs of relief when they witnessed this scene. Because even they couldn’t resist that bolt of lightning. Especially Lu Yan. He felt that he wasn’t confident in his ability to resist that Lightning of Obliteration even if he recovered his past strength.

At the same time, he was quite curious about why it was targeting Yin’yin!

It wasn’t just him, everyone else here was curious as well.

Only Yang Ye understood slightly. He still remembered that she’d told him about how an old man said her physique could devour all material substances. Of course, he didn’t think it was a big deal then, but he understood now.

The world was formed from various Laws and material substances. Since she could devour it all, it meant that she might even be able to devour the Heaven Dao of the Outer Heavens if she was allowed to grow!

Yin’yin was the most terrifying person in this world!

“Big... Big Brother....” Fear appeared in her eyes when that bolt of lightning locked onto her. Her instincts told her that it was very dangerous, extremely dangerous, and she was no match for it at all. Under such circumstances, she instinctively called out for her big brother.

As soon as she finished speaking, Yang Ye appeared by her side and took her hand.

“Don’t....” Lu Yan and Elder Mu were horrified and intended to stop Yang Ye. However, Yang Ye shook his head and stopped them instead. He was naturally clearly aware what his actions represented, but could he just stand by idly and watch her die? He naturally would if it was anyone else, but it was Yin’yin. Yin’yin who’d once saved his life!

“Big Brother, you should go....” Yin’yin spoke abruptly, “It’s very powerful. Even Yin’yin can’t fight it. You’ll die!”

Yang Ye took a deep breath, held her hand, and spoke in a gentle tone, “Don’t be afraid even if Big Brother really can’t stop it. Big Brother will go with you!”

He wasn’t being impulsive when he spoke those words, and he really intended to do that. He always followed his heart throughout his lifetime, so regardless of whether it was when he killed or rescued people, he always had a clear conscience. If he abandoned Yin’yin because of the Lightning of Obliteration, then he wouldn’t have a clear conscience anymore!

Not everything would go according to one’s wishes throughout one’s lifetime. However, in Yang Ye’s opinion, all that mattered was to have a clear conscience!

Yin’yin gazed at Yang Ye, and there was no fear in her eyes anymore. There was an unusual expression that was quite complicated there instead. Perhaps even she didn’t understand her current emotions.

At this moment, everyone was looking at Yang Ye.

“As expected of the Sword Emperor!” It was the Hallowed Lord who spoke these words.

“No wonder Yin’yin trusted him that much....” The blind old man shook his head.

“No wonder Lei Lin trusted you without any reservations. Perhaps she wouldn’t have had to endure so many years of loneliness and pain if she met you earlier!” Xiao Ying stared at Yang Ye while a trace of softness could be seen in her eyes.

Meanwhile, Supreme Exalt He said, “Yang Ye, while I can’t stand the sight of you, I have to say that you’re a true man!”

The other experts of the Hallowed Grounds and even the defiant profounders nodded slightly while a trace of respect could be seen in their eyes.

Actually, many weren’t afraid of death, but very few could die for another.

Everyone here could sense how terrifying the Lightning of Obliteration was, and none of them could resist it. After all, it was beyond the strength of a Half-Saint.

However, Yang Ye dared to face it. Not to mention anything else, just such courage aroused admiration in the hearts of many!

The Lightning of Obliteration was very slow, but the terrifying pressure it carried was horrifying. The ground collapsed, space shattered, and all the mountains in an area of 300km were obliterated into nothingness.

Yang Ye’s gaze was extremely calm as he looked at the violet bolt of lightning that was only over 1km long. Was he afraid? Of course he was. It wasn’t something that he could resist at all. But fear didn’t mean that he wouldn’t dare to attack it.

A man could be evil, a man could die, but a man could absolutely not surrender!

The ancient sheath appeared in his grasp with a flip of his palm. Suddenly, he seemed to have thought of something, and he turned to look at Qin Bufan, “Qin Bufan, if you’re a man, then do as you promised just now!”

“Fuck....” Qin Bufan’s face twitched.
