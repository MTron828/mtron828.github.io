Chapter 971 – He’s Tired Of Living!

“What happened!?” As soon as his voice resounded, Yang Ye had appeared in front of Shang Qingying.

“Welkin Wolf Demon King and his forces launched a surprise attack. My grandfather, Instructor Zhuo, and the others were forced to enter spatial pockets to face the Saints on their side. Meanwhile, a Saint from Sky Divine Hall suddenly captured Wushuang, and he’d left the city with her before my grandfather and the others could even react.” Shang Qingying spoke in a solemn voice.

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Since they had an extra Saint, then why didn’t they just destroy the city?”

“It was almost destroyed!” Shang Qingying spoke in a low voice, “If it wasn’t for the arrival of a Saint from the Dao Order, then the city would have probably been leveled by now.”

“Why did they take her!?” Yang Ye’s face was calm, and there was no anger on it at all. After all, anger usually only displayed how useless a person was, and anger couldn’t solve anything.

Shang Qingying pondered deeply for an instant before she said, “If I’m not wrong, then it should be because of her physique. Lou Qianxiao is cultivating a mysterious technique, and it should be a type of mutual cultivation technique that requires women with special physiques. Even though I don’t know what physique she possesses, my grandfather once said that Lou Qianxiao would definitely not let her escape his grasps. I presume her physique is very important to him!”

Lou Qianxiao! Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly, “He’s tired of living!”

Shang Qingying’s eyelids twitched. Isn’t he a little too confident? Even though she’d never witnessed Lou Qianxiao’s strength, could someone who dared to speak about challenging the entire prefecture be weak?

Moreover, even with the strength and pride that Seng Yuan had displayed, Seng Yuan still respected Lou Qianxiao. So, it was obvious how formidable Lou Qianxiao’s strength was, yet Yang Ye seemed determined to kill Lou Qianxiao.

So, was it confidence or conceit?

Yang Ye suddenly asked, “Did he take her to Welkin Wolf Mountain Range or the north?”

Shang Qingying hesitated for a moment before she answered, “The mountain range!”

Yang Ye looked Shang Qingying in the eyes and said, “Are you keeping something from me?”

She sighed softly in response, “Yang Ye, I know that it’s impossible to keep it from you, and I just hope that you’ll be able to stay calm after you hear it. After he took Yu Wushuang, he asked that you come to Welkin Wolf Peak on your own. Wushuang was one of their objectives, but they had another objective, and it was to kill you. So, you absolutely can’t go to Welkin Wolf Peak!”

“What a good plan!” Yang Ye laughed coldly, “They got Wushuang and can draw me out as well. That really is a good plan indeed.” When he spoke up to this point, Yang Ye looked at Shang Qingying and said, “Are the Dean and the others still fighting in those spatial pockets?”

Shang Qingying nodded.

Yang Ye asked, “What about that Saint from the Dao Order?”

Shang Qingying hesitated for a while before she replied, “He....”

Yang Ye waved his hand and said, “I get it now. There was no relationship between him and Wushuang, and because of my relationship with the Dao Order, it was utterly impossible for him to fight a Saint for Wushuang.”

When he spoke up to this point, Yang Ye spoke solemnly, “Presently, the Ocean of Clouds Academy, the Ancient Sword School, and the Dao Order have joined forces, and both the Ancient Sword School and Dao Order have dispatched a huge number of experts. So, why haven’t they set out into battle? Why did they insist on waiting for the enemy to attack before they joined the battle?”

Shang Qingying fell silent for a long time before she said, “Even though we’ve formed an alliance, we’re not truly united in the end. Moreover, it’s the academy’s business. So, the Ancient Sword School and Dao Order would probably have not lent a hand if they weren’t worried about Sky Divine Hall trying to encroach on the south. In short, unless they have to, they will absolutely not assist the academy with their full strength.”

Yang Ye shook his head, “Everyone will be finished sooner or later if this goes on!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he didn’t waste his breath anymore, and he just vanished on the spot.

Shang Qingying was shocked, “Where are you going!?”

However, she received no answer from Yang Ye.

Yang Ye had just left the city when a ray of light descended before him. It was Lu Wan’er.

She asked, “You’re going to save Yu Wushuang?”

Yang Ye nodded.

“You’re very strong now, and you’ve even surpassed me!” Lu Wan’er looked him in the eyes, “However, it’s impossible for you to be a match for a Saint. You’ll definitely die if you go.”

Yang Ye took a deep breath and smiled, “Wan’er, I’m no fool. If I were to fight a Saint in single combat right now, then there’s a 90% possibility that I’ll be the one who dies. You can say that it’s very likely for me to find eternal sleep if I were to head to Welkin Wolf Peak now. However....” When he spoke up to this point, the smile on his face gradually vanished, “There are many times in life that while we know it’s something we can’t do, we still have to do it. Why? Because there are some people and some things that are more important than our own lives.”

Yang Ye knew that heading to Welkin Wolf Peak like this was an impulsive move. However, he didn’t regret his decision because he knew very well what he was about to do.

Lu Wan’er gazed at him for a long time and said, “Will you not reconsider?”

Yang Ye nodded.

Lu Wan’er stated, “Then I’ll go with you!”

Yang Ye was slightly stunned, and he gazed at her for a long time before he shook his head, “The Saints on our side can be said to not exist right now. If you’re not here and Seng Yuan attacks, then it’ll be....”

“Is that what you’re really thinking?” Lu Wan’er suddenly interrupted him and said, “Is that the true reason why you refuse to let me go?”

Yang Ye remained silent for a short while before he said, “I alone am enough!”

Lu Wan’er replied, “You think that I’ll be a burden?”

He answered, “I didn’t say that.”

She asked, “Then why won’t you let me go?”

He waved his hand and replied, “Don’t linger on that. Just stay in the city. I don’t want to waste any more time here.” Yang Ye turned around and left once he finished speaking.

However, it didn’t take long for him to be stopped by her again.

Yang Ye’s face fell, and his gaze gradually became cold, “I told you to stay in the city!”

Lu Wan’er’s delicate figure trembled when she saw his reaction, and she suddenly felt extremely aggrieved in the bottom of her heart and pearls of tears could be seen in her eyes.

Yang Ye glanced at her and vanished into the horizon.

Lu Wan’er was very strong, but it was far from sufficient to deal with a Saint. Yang Ye didn’t want her to take such a risk with him. Because both Lu Wan’er and Yu Wushuang were people that he cared about, and he didn’t want any one of them to be in any danger!

Lu Wan’er remained silent on the spot for a long time as she watched Yang Ye vanish into the distance.

A long time passed before she finally moved and vanished on the spot.

...

Welkin Wolf Peak. The city gates.

Yu Wushuang was seated at the center of the entrance to the city, and an old man in violet robes sat by her side. Seng Yuan and another green robed man stood on either side of the old man.

“Senior Li Yun!” Seng Yuan glanced at Yu Wushuang and said, “That little girl is the woman who Brother Qianxiao needs?”

The old man glanced at Yu Wushuang and said, “Little Girl, I heard of your ability a long time ago, but I never expected you to be better than I imagined. Unfortunately, you won’t be able to escape death. Otherwise, you’ll be of great help to Qianxiao in the future.”

Yu Wushuang lowered her head slightly and remained silent.

Seng Yuan asked, “Senior Li, will that fellow, Yang Ye, come?”

Li Yun replied, “That depends on this little girl’s status in his heart!”

Seng Yuan suddenly said, “Senior, please allow me to fight him if he does come!”

Li Yun glanced at Seng Yuan and said, “You’ve lost twice to him!”

Seng Yuan spoke in a low voice, “I’ll be truly serious this time!”

Li Yun withdrew his gaze from Seng Yuan, and a long time passed before he said, “I can let the two of you fight if he refuses to act sensibly. However, I hope that you don’t lose again. Otherwise, while I will save you, it’ll definitely cause your heart to be affected, and it’ll be extremely detrimental to your future advancement into the Saint Realm.”

Seng Yuan’s heart shook, but he immediately nodded seriously while a fierce expression appeared in his eyes.

“He’s here!” Suddenly, a voice resounded. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

All of them looked over and saw a man had suddenly appeared far away in the distance. The man wore a black robe and had a ramrod straight figure. Even though he couldn’t be described as possessing a graceful bearing, he possessed a unique aura, and it was an aura of confidence and composure!

It was Yang Ye, of course!

Tears couldn’t help but flow down Yu Wushuang’s face as she watched him walk slowly in her direction.

It didn’t take long for Yang Ye to arrive just 15m away from them.

Yang Ye grinned to Yu Wushuang to indicate that she should rest at ease, and then he gazed at the old man, “I’m here!”

Li Yun gazed at Yang Ye for a long time before he said, “Needless to say, you’re really not bad. At the very least, no one in the prefecture can compare to your courage and composure.”

Yang Ye said, “I think that men should use our own way to deal with our problems, and we shouldn’t use women. What do you think?”

“Use women?” Li Yun laughed coldly, “I disdain to do so. Don’t worry, I won’t use her to threaten you. I merely used her to make you leave the city!”

Yang Ye said, “I’m here now, so shouldn’t you let her go?”

“There’s no rush to do that!” Li Yun said, “Yang Ye, you’re quite an expert, and your talent will be buried if you stay at Ocean of Clouds Academy or the Ancient Sword School. Because their gazes are only limited to Pine Prefecture, so they won’t be able to achieve great things. However, my Sky Divine Hall has set its sights on the Central Divine Prefecture a long time ago. We need countless monstrous geniuses on our grand path into the Central Divine Prefecture, and you conform to our requirements.”

Yang Ye was slightly stunned, “You’re trying to recruit me?”

Li Yun replied, “Exactly. If you agree, then I’ll take you there right now. Once you join my Sky Divine Hall, you can choose any Divine Rank technique, treasure, and even some secret techniques of my Sky Divine Hall.”

Yang Ye chuckled, “What if I refuse?”

Li Yun asked, “Are you sure?”

Yang Ye nodded and replied with a question, “Are you sure about refusing to let Wushuang go?”

A slight smile appeared on Li Yun’s face, “I’m very sure!”

Yang Ye gazed at Li Yun for a few moments and said, “Then let’s fight!”

As soon as he finished speaking, a sword howl resounded through the sky.
