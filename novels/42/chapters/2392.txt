Chapter 2393 – Poverty Limits Her Imagination!

Yang Ye stood silently before the city for a short while, and then he restrained his thoughts and entered Divine Martial City!

Divine Martial City!

Divine Martial Continent could be described as a city where everyone cultivated in the Martial Dao, and its attainments in the Martial Dao was extremely advanced. Of course, it was still weaker than Eternal Border. After all, Eternal Border was where a myriad of worlds intersected, and the most advanced Martial Dao in all the worlds was there!

As for Divine Martial City, it could be said to be the center of the civilization of the Martial Dao on Divine Martial Continent. It had the most advanced Martial Dao on this continent.

Once he entered the city, Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings and noticed that everyone here cultivated in the martial arts.

Meanwhile, Snowy appeared on his shoulder.

Yang Ye glanced at her, and she cracked a smile. Obviously, she’d gotten bored inside the pagoda and wanted to play outside!

Yang Ye smiled and didn’t make her go back inside.

Yang Ye took Snowy further into the city. His destination was the Divine Martial Sect, and it was at the center of the city.

All along the way, Snowy kept looking left and right. Unfortunately, nothing was to her liking.

Suddenly, a woman appeared before Yang Ye.

Yang Ye glanced at her. She was around the age of 20, seemed quite pretty, and had a sword on her waist.

She glanced at Yang Ye and asked, “Is your surname Yang?”

Yang Ye nodded, “It is!”

She spoke indifferently, “My young master wants to see you! Come with me!”

She turned around and walked away.

Yang Ye rubbed his nose and was quite surprised. Someone wanted to see him? It was the first time he’d been to Divine Martial World!

Suddenly, she turned around and gazed at Yang Ye, “I told you to come with me! Didn’t you hear me?

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts and glanced at her, “Is this how your young master taught you to invite someone?

She frowned slightly, “What? Do you want me to kneel down and beg you?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “How unreasonable!”

He ignored her and walked off toward the city.

Her gaze turned icy cold. Suddenly, another woman appeared before Yang Ye. She wore a green dress, and there was a sword by her waist as well.

She bowed slightly to Yang Ye, “Young Master Yang, I’m Left Sword. When my young master found out you’d come here, we were sent especially to invite you to Cloud Residence.”

Yang Ye asked, “Your young master knows me?”

She shook her head slightly, “I do not know. However, you should be able to find out once you get there.”

Yang Ye shook his head and smiled, “I have other matters to attend to, so I won’t be going!”

He walked around her and just walked off into the distance.

Suddenly, the woman from before appeared in front of Yang Ye. She gazed coldly at him, “So you plan to act insensibly?”

Snowy blinked on Yang Ye’s forehead, and then she clapped her paws together lightly. A ray of black light suddenly shot up into the air from the rear mountains of Void Mountain, and then it descended onto the Ascension Platform!

It was Oxxy with the Primordial Axe of Creation in his grasp!

Oxxy looked up into the sky and was ready to attack at any moment!

Outside the Primordial Pagoda, Yang Ye walked over to her and looked her in the eyes, “Move aside!”

Her eyes narrowed slightly, and the sword by her waist started trembling. It was about to leave its sheath!

Suddenly, Snowy waved her paw, and the sword on her waist immediately left its sheath and entered Snowy’s grasp.

Snowy shook her head as she gazed at it. It was actually a Pseudo Divine Treasure, but it was nothing to Snowy now!

However, Snowy didn’t plan to return it. She just waved her paw and sent it into the Primordial Pagoda.

The woman was stunned, and then she exploded with rage. She pointed at Snowy and howled with fury, “Where is it?!”

Yang Ye frowned. Meanwhile, Snowy blinked, and then her gaze descended onto the ring on the woman’s finger. A moment later, she waved her paw, and the ring immediately struggled free of the woman and flew into Snowy’s grasp.

Snowy glanced at it, shook her head, and then threw it into the Primordial Pagoda with a face of disgust.

At this moment, the woman in front of Yang Ye was beyond furious, “You’re courting death!”

As soon as she said that, she used her hand as a sword and pointed it at Yang Ye from afar.

Hiss!

An ethereal sword stabbed at Yang Ye’s forehead!

The sword was very fast, so fast that it surprised Yang Ye a little. However, it was quite difficult to kill him with such speed. Moreover, while it was fast, its strength wasn’t sufficient. It could be said that he could just use his physical strength to defend himself against it!

However, Yang Ye didn’t do that. He tapped the tip of his right foot against the ground and vanished on the spot. A moment later, a hand grabbed the woman’s throat!

Her eyes opened wide, and they were filled with disbelief!

This man who was around her age had actually been able to restrain her in just one move!

Suddenly, Yang Ye slammed her against the ground.

Bang!

The ground instantly cracked open, and her head sunk into the ground.

Suddenly, a ray of sword energy assaulted Yang Ye from behind.

Left Sword had attacked decisively when she saw Yang Ye restrain the woman!

Yang Ye released the badly injured woman and slammed a punch forward.

Bang!

An explosion resounded, and then Left Sword was blasted away and was almost blasted out of the city.

Countless gazes throughout the city were immediately attracted.

“Such formidable physical strength!” Someone exclaimed with shock, “It’s probably at the World Lord Realm. He's a monstrous genius to be able to cultivate his body to such an extent!”

At the edge of the city walls, Left Sword glanced at her right hand. It had cracked open, and it wasn’t the only thing which had cracked open. There were countless cracks on her sword too!

Such powerful physical strength!

Left Sword looked up at Yang Ye, “Young Master Yang, we have no ill intent!”

“You don’t?” Yang Ye grinned, “You two just tried to kill me, yet you say that you don’t have ill intent?”

Yang Ye suddenly vanished on the spot once he finished speaking, and he was in front of Left Sword when he appeared again. The latter’s pupils constricted, and she stabbed her sword forward. However, Yang Ye grabbed onto it!

He'd grabbed her sword with just his bare hands!

Despair covered Left Sword’s face. She knew that this man’s strength wasn’t something the two of them could rival!

“Brother Yang, please show mercy!” Suddenly, a weak voice came from the side.

Yang Ye looked over, and he saw a man walking over slowly in a white velvet robe.

The man was extremely handsome. He had flawlessly exquisite features, a slender and tall figure, and was holding a white silk scarf. However, he seemed extremely frail.

It was no man, it was clearly a woman dressed as a man!

She walked over to him, but Yang Ye was still holding onto Left Sword’s sword.

She grinned, “Young Master Yang, can you put it down?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “Give me an explanation. If you can’t, I’ll be taking the heads of these subordinates of yours!”

Left Sword’s expression changed when she heard this!

The woman grinned, “You came from Eternal Border in search of a person, and I may be able to help you with that!”

Yang Ye released the sword and walked over to her, “How?”

She smiled, “Let’s go someplace else?”

Yang Ye replied, “Alright!”

She glanced at the woman on the ground, shook her head, and then looked at Left Sword. The latter hurriedly knelt down, “I deserve death!”

The woman closed her eyes, “Your haughtiness is a problem, and it needs to be fixed!”

She turned around and left.

Yang Ye followed her.

Yang Ye glanced at her from behind, and he seemed quite vigilant. She felt dangerous to him!

Dangerous!

She could make him sense danger!

After all, he wouldn’t sense any danger when facing a Two World Realm expert!

A short while later, Yang Ye followed her to a place called Cloud Residence.

Cloud Residence was built on a cliff, and there were three bamboo houses here. When someone walked out of the bamboo house, one would be able to see the clouds. It was like a paradise for immortals.

The woman sat cross-legged on a jade rock by the cliff, and there was a tea table set before her. On the table were two cups and some fruits!

There were two women standing at the side. One of them was Left Sword, and the other woman was called Right Sword!

The woman glanced at Snowy who was on Yang Ye’s shoulder, “That’s the Sprite Progenitor?”

Yang Ye glanced at her, “Not yet!”

She smiled, and she knocked the table lightly with her right hand. A short moment later, a fiery red fruit appeared on the table. As soon as it appeared, a refreshing fragrance arose here, and it refreshed the soul, gladdened the heart, and made one’s entire body feel extremely comfortable!

The eyes of both women were filled with shock when they saw the fruit.

The Mysterious Spirit Fruit!

It was a strange fruit that could improve the cultivation and bloodline. It was a divine treasure! Not only was it very useful to people, it was even more useful to demons!

It could be said that even the Divine Martial Sect couldn’t produce many fruits like this!

She offered it to Snowy and smiled, “It’s for you!”

Left Sword and Right Sword’s chins almost hit the ground from shock.

She’s giving it to that little fellow?

Left Sword and Right Sword gazed at Snowy. They really wanted to ask what made the little fellow so special to receive that fruit! After all, a Two World Realm demon had been willing to serve their master for 20 years in order to obtain that fruit! However, their master hadn’t agreed to it. Yet now, she was willingly giving it away?

Snowy touched the fruit, and then she shook her head. After that, she pushed it to the woman.

“Huh?” The woman gazed at Yang Ye. Obviously, she didn’t understand what Snowy meant.𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and translated, “She’s saying that it’s trash.”

The woman’s face froze!

“Nonsense!” Suddenly, Right Sword spoke angrily, “That’s a divine fruit, a divine fruit? Do you know what that is? It’s a divine fruit comparable to a Divine Treasure! That pet of yours doesn’t recognize such a treasure and actually calls it trash?! How laughable!”

She seemed to have thought of something at this point, and she glanced at Yang Ye with fear while taking two steps back.

Snowy gazed at Yang Ye and pointed at the fruit before waving her paws.

Yang Ye nodded, “Don’t explain. I understand. It isn’t the fruit that’s not good enough, it’s she who’s too poor. Poverty limits her imagination. She isn’t on the same level as you!”

Snowy blinked.
