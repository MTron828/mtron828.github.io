Chapter 1941 – Ocean Prison!

Suddenly, the woman’s voice came from behind him, “So you refuse to leave, right?”

Yang Ye stopped, “Help me give Xiao Qi a message. I don’t know why she refuses to meet me, but I’ll definitely come back for her!”

His figure vanished into the sky once he finished speaking.

The woman shook her head, “He’s courting death, but that’s fine too!”

…

After he left, Yang Ye shot straight for the Endless Ocean.

This time, he hadn’t expected that the sword would have created so much trouble for him. Not only was the Sovereign of Man after it, even the other races wanted it. However, it allowed him to realize that the sword he had was far greater than he’d expected!

Just thinking about being pursued by the experts of numerous different races made a chill run down Yang Ye’s spine. At this moment, he felt like throwing the sword away!

Yang Ye shot swiftly through the clouds, and it didn’t take long for him to arrive at the Endless Ocean.

It was the largest ocean in the Sky Dimension, and it was guarded by Gu Nie. Yang Ye’s objective was Gu Nie. Of course, he wasn’t here to assassinate Gu Nie, he was here to save Yin Hou!

Yang Ye snuck to the bottom of the ocean without making a sound.

There was a completely different world down there,

There was a city at the bottom of the Endless Ocean, and it was called Endless City. However, something quite strange about it was that the city was isolated from seawater, or to be more precise the seawater surrounded the city yet was stopped from entering it by a mysterious force. So, it was independent down at the bottom of the ocean, and it wasn’t one with the seawater.

Yang Ye snuck into the city, glanced at the surroundings, and then vanished on the spot.

Endless Palace.

Endless Palace was situated at the center of the city, and it was Gu Nie’s residence. Yang Ye snuck over to it and was about to sneak in when his expression suddenly changed, and he hurriedly stopped. A moment later, he merged into one with the shadows at the corner of the wall.

Meanwhile, a wave of divine sense swept through where he’d been a moment ago.

Yang Ye remained motionless in the shadows.

It didn’t take long for the divine sense to vanish, but Yang Ye still didn’t move. Around ten breaths of time later, the divine sense swept the area once more.

Two breaths of time later, it vanished!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye transformed into a black shadow that entered the palace.

The palace was empty.

Yang Ye didn’t stay here. He immediately left and went to the abode at the back of the palace.

It was Gu Nie’s abode!

In the abode, Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings. Suddenly, he looked towards the right, and a smile curled up on the corners of his mouth. A moment later, he vanished on the spot.

In a luxurious room, a young man was seated cross-legged on the ground, and he emanated a faint green light.

It was Gu Bang whom Yang Ye had heavily injured in Sky City!

At this moment, he was clearly healing.

Suddenly, he took a deep breath, and then a mouthful of foul air flowed out from him.

Gu Bang opened his eyes. A ferocious glow flashed throughout, “You lowly human! Just you wait, I’ll make living worse than death for you!”

He naturally hated Yang Ye. Yang Ye had heavily injured him in public, and it was definitely a terrible humiliation. Now, he didn’t even dare to visit Sky City because it was too embarrassing.

Gu Bang stood up once he finished speaking.

At the moment he did that, a wave of mysterious energy suddenly appeared within the room.

Gu Bang’s expression changed drastically, and he was about to attack. However, a sword pressed against his forehead.

Gu Bang’s figure stiffened on the spot, and he didn’t dare move a muscle!

He stared at Yang Ye and said, “It’s you!”

Yang Ye smiled, “Is it a surprise? A pleasant surprise?”

Gu Bang’s expression was extremely unsightly.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye pressed his sword forward lightly, “I have a few questions. Don’t try anything because it’ll make you lose your head. Understand?”

Gu Bang spoke in a low voice, “What do you want to know?”

Yang Ye asked, “Where’s Yin Hou?”

Gu Bang hesitated for a moment and replied, “I don’t know!”

Hiss!

One of Gu Bang’s ears flew into the air, and it made his expression changed drastically and almost cried out in pain. The only reason he didn’t make a sound was that a sword had stabbed half an inch into his forehead, and he would lose his life if it went any deeper.

Yang Ye smiled, “I’ll give you one more chance! It’s your last chance. Trust me, you’ll lose your head if you try that again!”

Gu Bang broke out in cold sweat.

A short while passed before he said, “The Ocean Prison! She’s being kept in the Ocean Prison!”

Yang Ye asked, “Where is it?”

Gu Bang answered in a low voice, “Deep underground below the city.”

Yang Ye asked, “Who participated in all of this?”

Gu Bang fell silent again.

Hiss!

Gu Bang’s remaining ear flew into the air, and his countenance instantly turned pale. He hurriedly said, “My father, a mysterious expert from the human race, and a golden robed man from the devil race.”

Yang Ye asked, “No one else?”

Gu Bang replied, “There are. But they didn’t join the battle, and they seemed to be looking for you.”

Yang Ye smiled, “Isn’t your father looking for me too?”

Gu Bang glanced at Yang Ye and said, “You won’t be able to escape. The sky race isn’t the only race that wants to kill you, the experts of the other races want to kill you too. Right, experts from the shaman race seem to be participating too. You’re the one all of them want!”

The shaman race? Yang Ye laughed coldly. The holy sword was much more enticing to others than he’d ever imagined!

“I have a Soul Plate!” Meanwhile, Gu Bang suddenly said, “If you kill me, my Soul Plate will crack apart, and my father will notice you.”

Yang Ye gazed at Gu Bang and smiled, “Thanks for reminding me. Otherwise, I would have almost caused my plan to fail!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye slammed his left fist into Gu Bang’s head. Gu Bang didn’t die, and he just fell unconscious.

Yang Ye dragged Gu Bang’s unconscious figure into the Primordial Pagoda because he was still useful!

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings and vanished on the spot.

Yang Ye snuck out of the city, and then went deep underground. It didn’t take long for him to notice a huge pitch black tower.

The Ocean Prison!

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings. The divine sense of experts was sweeping through the surroundings. However, his Sword Domain concealed him from them.

Yang Ye noticed that the pagoda only had four levels, but some sort of energy was obstructing his divine sense from entering it.

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment, and then he vanished on the spot.

Yang Ye arrived at the 1st level, but he didn’t see Yin Hou. He didn’t stop here and went to the 2nd level. The 2nd level was much smaller, and the people confined here were much fewer. However, they were much stronger than the people locked up on the 1st level!

He still didn’t see Yin Hou!

Yang Ye continued upwards. It didn’t take long for him to get to the 3rd level. The 3rd level was even smaller, and only a few were confined here. However, all of them were at the Dao Realm.

The Dao Realm was divided into four stages, the hear, know, see, and attain stages. Everyone on this level was at the Hear Dao Realm!

Yang Ye still didn’t find Yin Hou here.

Yang Ye continued upwards, and he arrived in the 4th level.

The 4th level was very tiny, and it was quite ghastly too.

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings. Suddenly, a voice resounded, “Tsk, tsk. The 6th stage of the True Realm, yet you were actually able to get here? Huh? That’s the Sword Domain! A Domain! No wonder!”

Yang Ye looked towards its source, and he saw a dark red cage on his right. A middle aged man with hair that hung down to his shoulders was locked up within the cage, and his entire body was covered in pitch black chains.

The middle aged man didn’t have any arms or legs!

Yang Ye glanced at the middle aged man before moving his gaze away. He turned around and saw a pitch black cage on the other side, and a woman was within it.

It was Yin Hou.

However, her head was slightly drooping, and she seemed to be unconscious. Besides that, there were numerous fist-sized chains coiled around her. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Yang Ye’s face fell. He walked over to the cage. Meanwhile, the middle aged man suddenly said, “You can’t break those chains!”

Yang Ye turned to gaze at the middle aged man.

The middle aged man continued, “The chains and these cages were specially made by the sky race to imprison Dao Realm experts. Dao Realm experts at the See Dao Realm or below will have their blood, profound energy, and even souls restrained once they are imprisoned in these cages and chains. You…”

Suddenly, Yang Ye flipped his palm, and a sword appeared in his grasp. He immediately raised it and swung it!

Hiss!

The middle aged man watched with astonishment as the cage around Yin Hou was sliced open!

The middle aged man was stunned.

Yang Ye didn’t waste his breath, and he just swung his sword repeatedly.

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!

The chains around Yin Hou were instantly sliced apart.

“That’s the Xuan…” Suddenly, the middle aged man said something, but for some unknown reason, he stopped speaking before he finished.

Yang Ye ignored the middle aged man. He went over to Yin Hou and transported her into the Primordial Pagoda.

Suddenly, the middle aged man said, “Save me!”

Yang Ye glanced at the middle aged man, “Why should I?”

The middle aged man fell silent for a moment, and then he said, “I’ll owe you a favor!”

Yang Ye gazed at the middle aged man for a long time, and then he raised his sword and swung it.

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!

The cage and chains around the middle aged man were instantly sliced apart.

Once he regained his freedom, the middle aged man took a deep breath, and then his body started to tremble.

It was from excitement!

The middle aged man’s arms gradually grew back, and so did his legs.

He turned to look at Yang Ye, “Young Brother, can you help me with something else? Help me destroy this prison, alright?”

Yang Ye fell silent for a moment, and then he raised his sword with both hands and swung it!

Boom!

In an instant, the entire prison collapsed.

At this moment, all the others trapped within the prison were released. However, they didn’t flee immediately, and they went over to the middle aged man and knelt down instead, “My lord!”
