Chapter 2174 – Not Tolerated by the Heaven Dao!

All of them were shocked, but it didn’t take long for a smile to appear on Yang Ye’s face!

The 6th level!

The 6th level of the Primordial Pagoda was open to him! Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Yang Ye vanished on the spot with everyone, and they arrived in front of a door.

A pitch black door!

It led to the 6th level of the Primordial Pagoda!

What was inside?

Yang Ye couldn’t help but feel anticipation well up in him. After all, he’d obtained great benefits from every single level.

Yang Ye stopped thinking about it and entered through the door.

The other side was completely empty! There was nothing there!

Yang Ye frowned. Suddenly, Snowy inhaled, and then the surroundings were filled with spirit energy. An instant later, a ray of white light flashed and appeared before Yang Ye.

Armor!

It was a completely violet armor that had appeared before Yang Ye. It had flowing light coiled around it, and it was clearly not ordinary!

“The Primordial Armor!” Suddenly, a voice resounded, and then a figure appeared here.

The Dao Progenitor!

It was the Dao Progenitor, but it wasn’t his main body.

“The Primordial Armor?” Yang Ye gazed at the Dao Progenitor.

The Dao Progenitor nodded slightly, “When the world was created, there were three types of energy. Chaos Energy, Primordial Violet Energy, and Natural Spirit Energy. Primordial Violet Energy has such heaven defying abilities because it’s one of those three energies. The Primordial Armor is made from countless years of Primordial Violet Energy. As for how long it took to condense, I’m not very sure. It was already there when I obtained this pagoda. However, it hadn’t fully taken form. Now, it’s 80% complete.”

80%!

Yang Ye asked, “So it can be used now, right?”

The Dao Progenitor nodded, “Yes.”

As he spoke, he gazed at it and continued, “Once it has fully formed, it will become impenetrable and everlasting with the world.”

Yang Ye hurriedly asked, “Can it resist the attacks of progenitors?”

The Dao Progenitor glanced at Yang Ye and said, “It can. However, while it can, your body can’t. So, if you fight a progenitor, the outcome will be that it will be unharmed but you will be dead within it!”

Yang Ye was stunned speechless.

The Dao Progenitor continued, “Your own body is the best. All other external forces may be good, but you must not rely on them too much!”

Yang Ye nodded, “I understand!”

The Dao Progenitor grinned, “Let me help you!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he tapped his finger in Yang Ye’s direction, and the armor instantly transformed into a ray of violet energy that entered Yang Ye’s body. In an instant, Yang Ye’s eyes opened wide, and then cracking started to resound throughout his body.

The Primordial Armor started to shrink over and over again, and it merged completely into one with Yang Ye’s body!

Of course, it was because the Dao Progenitor was here. Otherwise, it would be quite difficult for him to subdue the Primordial Armor.

A long time passed before Yang Ye opened his eyes, and then he issued a command in his heart. A thin violet armor swiftly appeared around him, and it stuck to him like skin.

Meanwhile, the Dao Progenitor said, “Try it!”

Yang Ye nodded, and then he circulated his profound energy. A moment later, Yang Ye’s expression changed because it was madly absorbing the violet energy within him, and it only took half a breath of time for half of his profound energy to vanish!

Yang Ye gazed at the Dao Progenitor. The latter grinned, “The Primordial Armor is on the same level as the Sword Supreme. You were able to use the Sword Supreme because it hadn’t awakened. If you use it now, you can only swing it twice at most right now. It’s the same for the Primordial Armor, it requires the support of a huge amount of spirit energy, and you are only barely able to activate it right now. Moreover, it can only stay active for less than ten minutes or your profound energy will dry up!”

Less than ten minutes!

Yang Ye laughed bitterly. It was the flaw in the greatness that was the Primordial Armor!

“Don’t be dissatisfied!” Meanwhile, the Dao Progenitor said, “It’s something for Progenitor Realm experts to use. So, using it by force now will have its drawbacks. It’ll be normal once your strength grows.”

Yang Ye nodded. He sensed the Primordial Armor, and he felt extremely light like he was just a feather.

After that, Yang Ye started getting used to the armor, and it didn’t take long for him to master it. So long as he was in battle, he could activate it immediately. Simply speaking, even two Progenitor Realm experts couldn’t kill him in an instant by launching a surprise attack against him!

Once he was done mastering the armor, Yang Ye left the pagoda and traveled to Sky Sky continent with the others!

Sky Sky continent was in the medium universe, and it only took him less than three days to get there with his current strength.

Sky Sky Continent!

The spirit energy throughout Merak System had become extremely scarce. Moreover, Yang Ye could sense that it was still vanishing incessantly at a rapid pace!

Yang Ye entered the continent, and he noticed that it was filled with a heavy aura of death. It was unlike the Sky Sky Continent he once knew!

Little Sky stood silently by Yang Ye’s side.

“AH!” Suddenly, a shrill cry came from afar.

Yang Ye looked over, and he saw a few middle aged men attacking two old men. One of the old men’s arm had flown off into the air. Meanwhile, a middle aged man grabbed that arm, or to be more precise, he’d grabbed the spatial ring on it.

The middle aged man glanced at the spatial ring, and then a ferocious expression appeared on his face, “There’s less than 100 immortal crystals in here!”

He suddenly slammed his palm at the old man while he spoke.

Bang!

The middle aged man was blasted away before he could even strike the old man. He flew over 1km away, but he wasn’t injured.

Everyone here stopped and gazed at Yang Ye.

Because it had been Yang Ye who’d done that.

Yang Ye flicked a spatial ring to the middle aged man. The middle aged man glanced at it, and then his expression changed because there were 2,000 immortal crystals in there!

2,000 was a huge amount of wealth!

Yang Ye asked, “Is this very common?”

The middle aged man gazed at Yang Ye and spoke with bewilderment, “What?”

Yang Ye asked, “Is robbing immortal crystals like this common?”

The middle aged man glanced at Yang Ye, hesitated for a moment, and replied, “Yes.”

Yang Ye replied, “Tell me in detail!”

The middle aged man asked, “Who are you?!”

Suddenly, a sword pressed against his forehead, causing his face to turn pale.

At this moment, he knew the young man before him far surpassed him in strength!

He didn’t dare to think about anything else and immediately explained, “For some reason, the spirit energy on the continent grew extremely scarce. Even some of the sacred grounds have pitiably scarce spirit energy left. Now, the continent is in chaos for the sake of seizing spirit veins and immortal crystals. Every power and independent cultivator is doing it.”

He laughed bitterly at this point, “If we don’t have profound energy, wouldn’t we cultivators be no different than ordinary people?”

Yang Ye nodded, “You can leave!”

The middle aged man and the others hesitated for a moment, and then they turned around and walked away. They heaved sighs of relief in their hearts when they noticed that Yang Ye had no intention to stop them, and then they sped up.

Meanwhile, the heavily injured old man walked over to Yang Ye, and one of them cupped his fist, “Thank you for saving my life!”

Yang Ye glanced at them, “It was nothing. Go on!”

They cupped their fists again and left.

Once they left, Yang Ye gazed at Little Sky, and he noticed her head was lowered while seeming to be lost in thought.

Yang Ye rubbed her head and spoke softly, “Don’t worry, Sky Sky Continent wouldn’t be destroyed.”

She looked up at the sky, “I’ve never seen the spirit energy vanish like this. It seems like the spirit energy is just vanishing naturally, and that’s extremely terrifying.”

It was vanishing naturally!

Yang Ye understood what Little Sky meant. It meant that it wasn’t done by man, and it was the intentions of the heavens!

For example, the spirit energy in the universe was a fixed amount, and it had been fully used up!

Could it be created?

Yang Ye didn’t know. As far as he was concerned, it was probably impossible. As for Snowy, she probably didn’t have the ability to create spirit energy limitlessly!

Yang Ye stopped thinking about it. He called Snowy outside, and then he gazed at her, “Can you sense it?”

Snowy glanced at the surroundings and nodded.

Yang Ye smiled, “Can you make the spirit energy here return to normal?”

Snowy thought for a moment and started waving her claws.

Conditions!

The little fellow was listing her conditions!

A short while later, Yang Ye smiled, “No problem. You can have as many roasted goats as you want once the spirit energy here recovers!”

Snowy’s condition was roasted goats!

Yang Ye naturally agreed to it.

Snowy cracked a smile when Yang Ye agreed, and then she glanced at the surroundings. After that, she spread her claws, and the entire world started to tremble before them.

With Snowy at the center, the spirit energy in the surroundings suddenly converged toward her, and then Yang Ye and Little Sky could sense the world was soundlessly changing!

Bang!

Suddenly, a dark red bolt of lightning tore through the clouds from high above and descended toward Snowy!

Changing the laws of the Heaven Dao!

It wasn’t tolerated by the Heaven Dao!
