Chapter 2562

As soon as she finished speaking, Yang Ye vanished on the spot.

Hiss!

A ray of sword energy tore through the space above the Ancient Sword Sect, and powerful sword intent and sword energy rippled through the sky!

In the air above the Ancient Sword Sect, the woman’s figure gradually turned ethereal, and then the space around her surged. An instant later, a wave of powerful energy rippled out through the sky.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye’s sword arrived!

Hiss!

Bang!

In the sky above the sect, an ear-piercing explosion resounded, and then that expanse of space was obliterated beneath Yang Ye’s attack!

After that, a figure was blasted out of there!

It was the woman in a black dress!

Force!

Yang Ye chose to use force to overcome her Space Domain! Any Domain, even his own, could be destroyed by force. All it took was a sufficiently strong attack!

At this moment, Yang Ye was at the Five World Realm, and he’d improved in every aspect. Coupled with the face that he was using Executor, his full strength could destroy her Space Domain without facing too much difficulty!

A single attack destroyed her Domain!

In the sky above the Ancient Sword Sect, the woman stopped around 1 km away from where she’d been. Her countenance was pale, her entire body had cracked open, and blood was spraying from her!

Getting one’s Domain destroyed was a very harmful thing!

She looked up at Yang Ye, “You’ve much stronger than before!”

Much stronger!

When she fought Yang Ye the other day, while Yang Ye’s strength wasn’t bad, it wasn’t as strong as it was right now.

Yang Ye couldn’t be bothered to waste his breath on her, and he just charged at her.

A single attack!

Bang!

That expanse of space before Yang Ye was instantly obliterated, and the woman was blasted away from within it!

She flew all the way out of the Ancient Sword Sect!

But she was still within the scope of the Myriad World Diagram!

However, the Myriad World Diagram was utterly incapable of trapping her because she possessed the Space Domain.

Meanwhile, the woman didn’t try to fight Yang Ye to the death. At the instant she’d been blasted away, her figure flashed and used space to teleport into the sky.

How could Yang Ye allow her to escape?

Two flying swords shot out from Yang Ye’s waist.

Far away in the sky, two rays of sword energy flashed, and then the woman was forced to a stop! Meanwhile, Yang Ye appeared before her and swung his sword!

13 overlapped swings with the Sword Domain!

That expanse of the sky was instantly obliterated before it!

The woman’s pupils constricted. This attack had shattered the space throughout the surroundings, and that was no different than shattering the foundation of her Space Domain!

But she didn’t wait for death to arrive!

Her eyes narrowed slightly, and then her body exploded apart. An instant later, a powerful wave of Soul Energy surged out like a volcanic eruption.

Boom!

The powerful wave of Soul Energy instantly blasted Yang Ye away. She didn’t attack again and just shot off into the sky. She’d detonated her body to execute that attack, so only her soul remained now. Thus, it was impossible for her to defeat Yang Ye who was holding a Super Divine Treasure.

Flee!

She didn’t try to fight him to the death! Staying alive was most important!

Unfortunately, she forgot that she was within the Ancient Sword Sect’s territory. So, she hadn’t even gone 300m away before a woman appeared in front of her.

It was Nether Maiden.

Nether Maiden gazed at her, “Didn’t you want a one on one battle?”

The woman gazed coldly at Nether Maiden, “You believed a lie like that?”

She crushed a black talisman once she finished speaking.

Boom!

A powerful aura swept out from within her, and then an ethereal shadow appeared in front of her.

The woman glanced coldly at Nether Maiden and the others, “We’ll meet again very soon!”

As soon as she finished speaking, she vanished into the sky.

Yang Ye and Nether Maiden were about to stop her when the ethereal figure suddenly raised its hands.

Bang!

The entire sky started revolving strangely, and then rays of powerful Soul Energy erupted from that strange expanse of space. At this moment, the entire Ancient Sword Sect was severely affected!

If Sword Scroll hadn’t quickly activated the sect’s formations, it would have been obliterated by now!

Just like that, the energy surged for around 10 minutes before the sky gradually calmed down again!

At this moment, Yang Ye and Nether Maiden were standing side by side. Both of them weren’t in a very good state. Especially Yang Ye, his entire body had cracked open. Nether Maiden was in a comparatively better state because she’d been standing behind Yang Ye just now.

A long time passed before Yang Ye’s body gradually recovered, and he gazed at Nether Maiden, “Are you alright?”

She shook her head slightly and looked into the distance. The ethereal figure was gone.

Nether Maiden said, “That figure’s main body is even stronger.”

Yang Ye nodded. The main body of that figure may even be the Soul Sect’s Master, and even if it wasn’t the Soul Sect’s Master, it was definitely an extremely terrifying existence!

The Soul Sect was very strong!

They returned to the sect. Yang Ye returned to his abode because Sword Scroll and Elder Gu Nan were there to deal with the sect’s affairs. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Yang Ye went back into the Primordial Pagoda.

This time, he felt that he was still lacking. Or it should be said that he needed to grow stronger!

Yang Ye went to the bamboo house to see Qi Bitian. At this moment, Qi Bitian wasn’t playing with her ball, and she was playing Gomoku with Lei Lin instead… They were having an absolute blast.

Lei Lin was very happy to see Yang Ye, and she immediately abandoned the game and went over to grab Yang Ye’s hand.

Qi Bitian glanced at Yang Ye with displeasure.

Why is this guy so annoying? He’s disturbing my game!

Yang Ye rubbed Lei Lin’s head, and then he led her over to Qi Bitian and smiled, “Continue your game, go on!”

He knew that he couldn’t interrupt Qi Bitian’s fun. That young girl did everything based on her mood. If her mood was good, she would be willing to help him with anything, but if her mood was foul, she would help with nothing and may even beat him up!

Lei Lin sat before Qi Bitian. Suddenly, Yang Ye spoke with surprise, “Whoa! Gomoku! You actually know how to play it?”

Qi Bitian glanced at Yang Ye, “Do you?”

Yang Ye replied seriously, “Of course. Before I stepped onto the path of cultivation, my dream was to become a great master of Go! Moreover, I planned to hold a Gomoku tournament in that world of ours. Unfortunately, I had to step onto the path of cultivation in order to survive! Sigh!”

“A Gomoku tournament?” Qi Bitian blinked, “One that many people will play together?”

Yang Ye nodded, “Yes!”

She spoke softly, “That should be quite fun!”

Yang Ye spoke seriously, “Of course! Anyway, you seem really good. How about we play a game?”

Qi Bitian glanced at Yang Ye, “Let’s play!”

Yang Ye nodded and started playing with her. It was a truly intense game between them. In the beginning, it was a very aggressive battle, but Yang Ye was always a step behind at the end and lost to her!

Every time that happened, Qi Bitian would smile like a child.

Finally, after losing eight times, Yang Ye sat at the side in dejection.

Meanwhile, Lei Lin blinked. She felt that something was off because Qi Bitian’s skill was terrible… Qi Bitian couldn’t even defeat her!

Lei Lin wondered if it was because she was an amazing player!

Thinking of that made her extremely happy.

Meanwhile, when she saw the dejection on Yang Ye’s face, Qi Bitian consoled, “Don’t be like that, you’re very good too!”

Yang Ye sighed softly, “Not as good as you!”

Qi Bitian smiled brilliantly while revealing undisguised complacency.

As if she couldn’t bear to strike another blow to his confidence, she hurriedly restrained her smile and consoled him again, “Your talent isn’t bad. If you work hard, you’ll have a chance at defeating me!”

Yang Ye sat up and said, “You’re right, I must work hard. Alright, let’s continue!”

Qi Bitian was naturally pleased with that.

So, they started again.

It was a close battle, but Yang Ye was still “a step behind” and lost.

This time, he didn’t get dejected. He continued playing with Qi Bitian, but he still lost!

Qi Bitian was smiling from ear to ear!

After countless games, Yang Ye suddenly spoke casually, “Little Qi, can you help me with something?”

They had gotten closer through these games. Previously, he called her senior, and she didn’t really like that method of address. So, she told him to call her Little Qi instead!

Qi Bitian was in a very good mood and didn’t even hesitate to ask, “What is it?”

Yang Ye withdrew Executor and placed it by the Go board, and then he spoke casually, “This sword was sealed, and so its strength isn’t fully released. I’m very weak and unable to undo the seal. Can you help me instead? Of course, we can continue playing if you think it’s too difficult!”

As he spoke, he snuck a glance at her and was rather nervous.

Qi Bitian glanced at the sword. Her gaze stopped on it for a moment, and then she put down another piece while she said, “Little Yang, this sword isn’t bad.”

Yang Ye replied humbly, “It’s just ordinary!”

As soon as it heard Yang Ye, Executor trembled and seemed to be expressing its dissatisfaction!

Yang Ye was stunned speechless.

Qi Bitian glanced at the sword again and said, “It’s not bad.”

She put down another piece and chuckled, “You’ve lost again!”

Yang Ye immediately had dejection all over his face, and it seemed as if he’d failed to advance into the Lord Realm.

Qi Bitian couldn’t bear to see him like that, so she picked up Executor and said, “Alright, alright. I’ll help you unseal it.”

She pressed her index and middle fingers together before tapping them on Executor’s blade.

Bang!

A powerful wave of sword intent and sword energy erupted!
