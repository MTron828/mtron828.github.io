Chapter 1437 – Allow Me To Be Honest, Who Do You Think You Are?

The head belonged to the Wilds Lord, of course.

Even though the Wilds Lord’s strength had risen tremendously, not to mention a temporary rise in strength, Yang Ye’s group wouldn’t even be afraid if another expert like the Wilds Lord joined the battle.

Presently, he possessed dual Quasi Returnal Rank intents and two Celestial Demon Wolves who could fight two peak Deities on their own. Not to mention the Wilds Lord, their joint forces could even defeat Qiong Qi. However, if Qiong Qi recovered his strength, then they would definitely be the one who were defeated. After all, Qiong Qi hadn’t recovered completely.

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts, glanced at the head that was flying through the air, and then shook his head as he said to himself, What a pity!

He’d used a little too much strength earlier.

He’d intended to kill the Wilds Lord slowly, and then refine him into a Sword Servant. If he could refine the Wilds Lord into a Sword Servant, then it would definitely be a great help to him. After all, the Wilds Lord wasn’t weak at all. However, Yang Ye was afraid that complications would arise at the critical moment, so he didn’t dare to hold back at all. Thus, he’d accidentally taken the Wilds Lord’s head.

Even though he’d lost an extraordinary Sword Servant, it wasn’t that bad. At the very least, the Wilds Lord was dead.

However, this wasn’t the end of it.

Yang Ye looked up towards the distance, and a woman and three old men had appeared not too far away from him. The woman wore violet gold armor, had curved brows, a sharp chin, exquisite facial features that were practically perfect, and a slender and tall figure. She was very striking. However, the most striking part about her was her eyes because they were actually black and white respectively!

Her eyes made her seem quite strange, but it didn’t affect her beauty.

Her appearance wasn’t inferior to Zhuang Weiran, Su Qingshi, and the others at all!

“I told you to stop! Didn’t you hear me?” She didn’t speak, and it was the black robed old man by her side who’d spoken these words. The old man stared fixedly at Yang Ye while rage and a trace of the intent to kill filled his eyes.

A smile curled up on the corners of Yang Ye’s mouth, “I should stop just because you said so? Allow me to be honest. Who do you think you are?”

“How dare you!” The old man instantly revealed a ferocious expression.

The old man was about to speak when Yang Ye suddenly pointed his sword at the old man, “Old man, do you want to fight?”

Yang Ye wasn’t an oppressive and domineering person, but he wasn’t someone who would take things lying down. If someone respected him, then he would respect that person; if someone didn’t respect him, then why would he show that person any respect? The old man had acted overbearingly since he’d arrived, so Yang Ye would naturally not be nice.

Because he was very well aware that if he was nice to such a person, then the person would try to take a yard.

The old man was stunned. Obviously, he hadn’t expected Yang Ye to say that. It didn’t take long for him to recover from his shock, and then a terrifying aura surged out from within him. However, it had only just appeared when the woman by his side waved her hand, and then a mysterious wave of energy swept towards the old man before the old man’s aura instantly vanished without a trace.

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly at the sight of that, and there was a trace of a solemn expression in them.

The woman was only a Semi-Deity, but she had obliterated the black robed old man’s aura with absolute ease. Such strength wasn’t ordinary. After all, the old man was a Deity, and his strength wasn’t inferior to Elder Yuan.

Yang Ye became vigilant inwardly. Even though he hadn’t fought her, that scene from before had proved how strong she was.

Express contempt strategically but take the enemy seriously!

The old man didn’t dare to say anything about the woman’s actions, and he immediately moved back and stood behind her.

Meanwhile, the woman gazed at Yang Ye’s forces. She sized up the Celestial Demon Wolves standing in front of Yang Ye, and then she gazed at Yang Ye, “You’re the first person in the Eastern Territory who has dared to challenge my Falling Sky Stellar Region like this.”

“Challenge?” Yang Ye chuckled and said, “I have no intention to do that. But I had no other choice. If you’re going to try and bully me, I have to fight back, right?”

“We’re trying to bully you?” The woman’s eyes narrowed slightly, “Wildlands Stellar Region had surrendered to my Falling Sky Stellar Region, yet you killed the Wilds Lord. Are you sure we’re trying to bully you?”

Yang Ye asked, “Do you know why Wildlands Stellar Region surrendered?”

She gazed at the young man whom Yang Ye had practically crippled just now. Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly said, “You don’t have to look at him. I’ll tell you. Wildlands Stellar Region joined forces with a few more stellar regions to attack my stellar region, but they lost. Understand? It was your stellar region that forcefully interfered in the enmity between my Clouds of Heaven Stellar Region and Wildlands Stellar Region. After that, you act all high and mighty while you tell me that I shouldn’t take revenge because Wildlands Stellar Region is under your protection. So tell me, are you bullying me, or am I bullying you?” Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

She gazed at Yang Ye for a long time before turning to look at the young man. The young man hesitated for a while before he said, “There is enmity between Wildlands Stellar Region and Clouds of Heaven Stellar Region, and I’m aware that they surrendered to us because they wanted to use us against Clouds of Heaven Stellar Region. However, Wildlands Stellar Region is a three star stellar region. It has 120 small worlds and a medium world. If we can obtain all of them, then it’s extremely beneficial to our Falling Sky Stellar Region.”

The woman remained silent for a long time before she said, “It’s not a big mistake!”

The young man heaved a sigh of relief when he heard her. He knew what she meant. His thoughts were correct, but he’d overlooked something, and it was Yang Ye’s strength and courage. He’d thought that using the name of Falling Sky Stellar Region would make Yang Ye retreat obediently, but he hadn’t expected Yang Ye to refuse and even kill the Wilds Lord before his reinforcements arrived!

It was no different than expressing contempt towards Falling Sky Stellar Region!

The young man glanced at Yang Ye, and then he moved behind the woman. Obviously, this matter was beyond his ability now.

She turned to look at Yang Ye, “All the worlds in Wildlands Stellar Region’s possession belong to my Falling Sky Stellar Region.”

The meaning behind her words was that she wouldn’t pursue the fact that Yang Ye had killed the Wilds Lord. However, Wildlands Stellar Region’s territory had to belong to Falling Sky Stellar Region.

Yang Ye shook his head, “Wildlands Stellar Region took 32 worlds from my Clouds of Heaven Stellar Region. They must be returned to my stellar region.”

Yang Ye had made a compromise as well. He could give up Wildlands Stellar Region’s territory, but the worlds which belonged to Clouds of Heaven Stellar Region had to be returned.

He didn’t know how strong four star stellar regions were. But it was obvious that they were definitely extremely strong. If he was all alone, then he wouldn’t have to fear them at all. Because they would have to send at least over 20 Deities to kill him, and those Deities might not even be able to succeed.

If he started launching surprise attacks, then he would be even more terrifying than an assassin!

However, he wasn’t alone. He had Clouds of Heaven Stellar Region. If they couldn’t do anything to him, they could act against Clouds of Heaven Stellar Region. Clouds of Heaven Stellar Region couldn’t afford to get into another war right now,

The woman suddenly said, “What if I refuse?”

Yang Ye nodded, “Then let’s fight. Perhaps I wouldn’t be able to destroy your stellar region but crippling it shouldn’t be a problem.”

Just as he’d said, if Falling Sky Stellar Region refused to return those worlds to Clouds of Heaven Stellar Region, then the only option was war. Even though Clouds of Heaven Stellar Region couldn’t afford to enter into war right now, it had no other choice. It had to fight this war matter what. After all, if they didn’t fight back when someone else took their territory, then wouldn’t it be aggrieving?

There were many occasions where death wasn’t terrifying. The terrifying thing was living a life that was worse than death.

They could lose their territory, but they couldn’t lose their backbone and dignity!

“Cripple us?” A wisp of ridicule curled up on the corners of the black robed old man’s mouth, “You will? Needless to say, those two beasts of yours are very strong. However, not to mention two of those beasts, my Falling Sky Stellar Region wouldn’t fear you even if you had 10 more.”

Yang Ye gazed at the black robed old man, “I think that since you’re not the one making the decisions, then can you keep your mouth shut? Otherwise, why don’t we have a spar?”

The old man spoke fiercely, “Do you think that I fear you?”

“Then bring it on!” As soon as Yang Ye finished speaking, he stomped his right foot down and transformed into a ray of light that shot at the old man. He was extremely swift and merely took an instant to arrive in front of the old man.

A ruthless expression instantly appeared on the old man’s face when he saw Yang Ye attack. However, the woman behind him suddenly spoke, “Be careful.”

Be careful? The old man was quite bewildered. But in just an instant, his expression changed drastically because a sword was descending towards him!

It was dangerous!

Extremely dangerous!

That was what the black robed old man felt right now, and he was shocked. The profound energy within him surged. At the same time, a black shield appeared above him, and then his profound energy surged madly like a torrent into the black shield, causing a ray of dazzling black light to burst forth from it. The black light instantly enveloped Yang Ye’s attack.

Bang!

However, just a moment later, a ray of dazzling light erupted from within the black light, and the black light was instantly blasted into bits. Moreover, the black robed old man’s shield exploded apart as well, and it transformed into bits of energy that rained down from the sky. At the same time, the black robed old man crashed down from midair and smashed into the ground.

Boom!

The ground shook violently while countless bits of dust shot up into the air.

The old man wasn’t dead, but he’d definitely lost the ability to fight. Of course, the reason he was alive was that shield. That shield had been a low-grade Origin Rank treasure.

Even a low-grade Origin Rank treasure had been blasted into pieces by a single attack from Yang Ye. Moreover, it had even crippled a Deity.

Because that attack wasn’t an ordinary Heavenrend, it was two overlapped Heavenrends that were enhanced by two Quasi Returnal Rank intents!

How terrifying was such an attack?

Yang Ye slowly sheathed his sword within the ancient sheath, and then he gazed at the woman’s group, “Deities? It only takes a single swing of my sword.”
