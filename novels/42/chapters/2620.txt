Chapter 2621 – Tian Xiu!

Xiu!

The Desolate Emperor looked to the side, and a young girl was walking slowly above the Boundless Water toward this direction!

The young girl’s figure was around the same size as Qi Bitian!

She had a petite figure and emanated faint dark light.

The Desolate Emperor’s eyes narrowed slightly from the sight of her, “The patriarch of the void race… Tian Xiu!”

Tian Xiu!

Gu Mo and the others looked up into the sky, and a trace of vigilance appeared in their eyes. But they revealed no fear!

This was the Origin World!

So long as Qi Bitian couldn’t act against them, they really had nothing to fear!ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Tian Xiu walked over to Yang Ye and Snowy. Yang Ye’s entire body surged with dense slaughter intent, and so he immediately raised his sword and swung it at Tian Xiu when she approached him!

Tian Xiu just gazed at him and didn’t move out of the way!

Yang Ye’s sword descended. But it suddenly stopped just around an inch away from her head!

Yang Ye stared at her with his blood red eyes, and then he gradually moved his sword away and charged at Gu Mo’s group!

However, a hand suddenly pressed down upon his shoulder!

Tian Xiu’s hand!

Yang Ye was instantly rendered immobile!

Tian Xiu gazed at Snowy, and the latter flew over to her and started crying. A short while later, Snowy pointed at her forehead, and there was a cut there.

Tian Xiu closed her eyes slowly while clenching her fist.

A short while later, she opened her eyes and gazed at Snowy with a grin on her face, “I’ll help you kill all of them!”

“You? Suddenly, Gu Mo spoke coldly.

Tian Xiu looked at him, and then a ray of dark light flashed!

Gu Mo’s pupils instantly constricted at the sight of the dark light!

At this moment, he had an unprecedentedly solemn expression on his face!

He didn’t dare to act carelessly at all, and he waved his saber with both hands. The Boundless Water on both sides of the bridge instantly rose 300m high!

The powerful force of the attack seemed capable of obliterating everything!

Meanwhile, the dark light arrived!

Hiss!

The saber energy was instantly blasted apart by the dark light, and then a figure flashed by!

It was so fast that many weren’t able to see it!

It didn’t take long for the surroundings to fall silent!

because Tian Xiu had already appeared before Gu Mo. At the same time, she’d grabbed him by the throat!

Gu Mo stared at Tian Xiu while his saber shook madly. A monstrous wave of demonic energy rippled out from the hilt of his saber! However, it was stopped by a ray of dark light!

Tian Xiu spoke softly, “Ruin!”

As soon as she said that, Gu Mo’s body was enveloped by a ray of dark light. An instant later, his body gradually turned ethereal!

“No!” Gu Mo was horrified as he left out a shrill howl of fury.

Meanwhile, the other Destiny Realm experts behind him charged at Tian Xiu!

Tian Xiu gazed at them, and then the space before her cracked open. A moment later, countless rays of dark light flashed forward like sharp blades!

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!

Space was sliced open with absolute ease!

The Destiny Realm experts were horrified, and they retreated. However, one of them was a little too slow and was struck by a ray of dark light which instantly obliterated the expert!

The Desolate Emperor frowned slightly, “The power of the Laws of the Grand Dao!”

The dark light contained the Laws of the Grand Dao!

However, he didn’t know which one it was!

The body of the Demon Saber Sect’s master had cracked open in Tian Xiu’s hands, and he gradually vanished, just like that!

Completely and utter suppression!

An instant kill!

At this moment, the remaining Destiny Realm experts were stunned!

After she killed the Demon Saber Sect’s master, Tian Xiu didn’t launch another attack. She looked up at Qi Bitian and asked, “Do you need help?”

Qi Bitian shook her head instead, “I’m fine, take care of him! His Slaughter Domain just took form, so he can’t control it, and he may be completely corrupted by it!”

Tian Xiu shook her head, “No, let him release it all!”

As soon as she finished speaking, she waved her right hand, and the dark light which enveloped Yang Ye vanished. A moment later, Yang Ye regained his freedom!

Slaughter intent!

Actually, Yang Ye was in quite a bad state right now. His desire to kill and slaughter intent were too strong. Especially his desire to kill, it was absolutely overwhelming!

It had surpassed the scope of his current cultivation!

Under such circumstances, it was very likely for him to be devoured by it! Moreover, there were only two ways to avoid the latent problems it would create. The first was for Tian Xiu to help him suppress it and allow his sword intent to emerge instead. In that way, Yang Ye would become normal again.

As for the other method, it was comparatively dangerous, and it was to let him release it! Madly release all his slaughter intent and desire to kill!

It was better to let it flow than to obstruct it!

That was what Tian Xiu had chosen to do. However, it was still quite dangerous. Because his desire to kill and slaughter intent were too strong. If they weren’t suppressed, and he was allowed to madly release it all, then the slightest mistake may lead to his death. However, it may also lead to greatness!

Now that he wasn’t bound anymore, Yang Ye charged at the nearby Destiny Realm experts. Besides that, An Nanjing charged forward as well.

Yang Ye wasn’t in a very normal state right now, and she was quite worried about him. She felt that she should stay close to him!

Snowy pointed at Yang Ye from atop Tian Xiu’s shoulder, and her eyes were filled with worry.

Tian Xiu grinned, “Don’t worry. He’ll be fine. Believe in him!”

Snowy rubbed her head against Tian Xiu’s head, and then she looked down at Erya. At this moment, Erya had swallowed the demon beast that had emerged from below the Boundless Water!

She’d eaten it alive!

At this moment, Erya was filled with an evil and vicious aura!

She was extremely vicious!

The vicious aura she emanated was even stronger than what Yang Ye was emanating right now!

As if she’d sensed something, Erya looked up and glanced at Snowy. As soon as she saw Snowy, the viciousness in her eyes instantly cleared up, and then she cracked a smile at Snowy. There was blood on the corners of her mouth… After that, she turned around and continued hammering the bridge!

She planned to obliterate it!

Or it should be said that she planned to destroy the entire world!

Yang Ye’s heart was full of the desire to kill, and her heart was full of rage.

Meanwhile, Tian Xiu suddenly gazed at the Desolate Emperor, “What is the fastest way to destroy this world?”

The Desolate Emperor’s eyes narrowed slightly, “I’m afraid that doing so will be bad.”

Tian Xiu asked, “Why?”

The Desolate Emperor smiled, “The interests of many powers are intertwined here. For example, the Yin World, Darkspace, Void World, Phantom World… Even some other mysterious experts who are from distant eras. All of them are cultivating at that place. So, if you destroy this world and affect that place, that place which requires Ancient Tokens or Soul Crystals to enter, I’m afraid they won’t permit it!”

Tian Xiu shook her head, “I don’t need their permission.”

The Desolate Emperor gazed at her for a long time and said, “If you really do affect that place, the situation you’re in will be worse than it is now, and it may go out of your control.”

Tian Xiu grinned, “Then let it happen!”

She pressed her right hand down. In an instant, the Boundless Water below surged, and then it suddenly started roiling under the effects of her powerful strength!

A short while later, the Boundless Water formed waves that rippled out in all directions!

“How dare you!” Suddenly, a furious shout came from Tian Xiu’s right, and then an old man in a black robe appeared near her!

“The Sky Palace’s master, Xuan Lin!” The Desolate Emperor spoke abruptly, “He’s no ordinary Destiny Realm expert!”

Tian Xiu gazed at Xuan Lin, “I’ll be doing worse. Just take your time and watch.”

She waved her right hand.

Bang!

Countless strands of Boundless Water transformed into water arrows that shot through the sky!

Destruction!

Tian Xiu’s sole objective was to destroy, destroy everything!

Xuan Lin’s face instantly turned unsightly. He didn’t do anything because he wasn’t confident in his ability to win. He looked up at the sky. Qi Bitian and the others were still in a stalemate!

They were sealing Qi Bitian bit by bit. Qi Bitian seemed to have been rendered immobile, and she didn’t try to struggle free as well. However, the seal was being obstructed by a mysterious force!

Simply speaking, both sides were helpless against each other!

Actually, Xuan Lin, the Divine Abode’s master, and all the other experts here were quite anxious!

Because Tian Xiu’s arrival was a variable in everything!

They’d made preparations to deal with Qi Bitian from the very beginning, so they didn’t panic when she arrived. But they hadn’t made any preparations for Tian Xiu’s arrival.

Tian Xiu!

Moreover, she was so strong!

Tian Xiu was in the Destiny Realm at the very least. Perhaps her cultivation may not be comparable to Qi Bitian, but she was still absolutely strong.

She was so strong that even an expert like the Sky Palace’s master didn’t have any confidence in being able to defeat her!

Meanwhile, Xuan Lin gazed at the Desolate Emperor, “Desolate Emperor, if they really destroy this world, then it will definitely affect that place. Are you really not going to do anything about it?”

The Desolate Emperor’s strength was actually so formidable that all the powers in the Origin World feared him!

Because the Origin World had benefited all those years ago when the Sprite Progenitor joined the battle, and they’d taken Eternal Kingdom’s side as a result of that. During that battle, the Desolate Emperor’s strength had shocked the entire Origin World!

But how strong had the Desolate Emperor grown after so many years had passed? Actually, they had no idea!

But they were certain that if he joined the battle, he would definitely be able to stop the woman before them! Including Yang Ye’s group!

The Desolate Emperor shook his head and smiled, “I’m just here to watch the show, just to watch the show.”

Xuan Lin stared at him, “Aren’t you worried that we’ll take the Eternal Kingdom’s side after all of this comes to an end?”

The Desolate Emperor grinned, “Aren’t you worried that I’ll kill you right now?”

Xuan Lin gazed at him for a long time. In the end, he didn’t choose to go head-on against the Desolate Emperor!

They’d fought during the war all those years ago!

He'd lost!

Xuan Lin gazed at Tian Xiu, “Since you plan to destroy the Origin World, then prepare to suffer the consequences of that!”

He withdrew a talisman and crushed it, and then a sharp sound shot up into the sky!

The Desolate Emperor smiled, “He’s calling for help! This is getting more and more interesting!”
