Chapter 1217 – Pursuit!

“Attack!” Jian Xu’s voice resounded as well. It didn’t take long for the experts of the Sword Alliance to charge at the experts from the World Devastator Cult.

Not only would Yang Ye refuse an offer of peace at this moment, even the others from the Sword Alliance wouldn’t agree to it. They were no fools; they knew that the World Devastator Cult was only seeking peace because it had no other choice right now. Because the Sword Alliance’s strength far surpassed it right now. Moreover, they didn’t believe that the World Devastator Cult truly sought peace between them, and it was merely a way to buy time.

Yang Ye knew that, and so did the others!

The middle aged man’s face became gloomy when he saw Yang Ye attack, and killing intent flashed through his eyes. Meanwhile, the sword energy had arrived before him. He twisted his right hand, and the folding fan swiftly unfolded and obstructed the blood red ray of sword energy.

Bang!

The folding fan shook violently while the middle aged man took around 10 steps back. A wisp of surprise and seriousness flashed through his eyes. Obviously, he hadn’t expected Yang Ye’s attack to actually be that terrifying!

Suddenly, Yang Ye appeared in front of him, and a blood red sword descended towards the middle aged man.

The middle aged man’s eyes narrowed slightly. He didn’t dare act carelessly. The profound energy within him surged as a terrifying aura shot out from within him and slammed towards Yang Ye. However, it had only just emerged from him when the slaughter intent, baleful energy, and Rebirth Realm sword intent within Yang Ye’s sword obliterated it. The middle aged man’s pupils constricted while his expression changed once more. He had no time to dodge, so he folded the fan once more and raised it to block Yang Ye’s attack.

Bang!

The middle aged man was slammed downwards by the force in Yang Ye’s attack, but it only took a moment for him to transform into a white ray of light that shot back up into the air!

Yang Ye’s blood red eyes suddenly narrowed before he grabbed the blood red sword with both hands and swung it down once more.

Bang!

Crack!

The sword and fan collided, and the space around them cracked apart. At the same time, the middle aged man was blasted down once more.

Yang Ye stood upside down in midair for a moment, and then he transformed into a ray of blood red like that shot towards the middle aged man.

Meanwhile, the middle aged man’s pupils constricted at the sight of Yang Ye’s figure charging down like a bolt of lightning. A moment passed before he twisted his wrist. The flipping fan swiftly unfolded while a beam of white light shot up into the sky and slammed against Yang Ye. However, it was instantly sliced open by Yang Ye’s sword while Yang Ye himself didn’t slow down at all and instantly arrived above the middle aged man.

The middle aged man’s pupils constricted once more. This time, there was shock in his eyes. Because Yang Ye’s attack was too incisive. Even he didn’t dare to act carelessly at all!

The middle aged man didn’t dare hold back anymore. He twisted his wrist, and the folding fan shot up into the sky. It started expanding as it flew through the air, and it was over 300m wide when it arrived in front of Yang Ye. Suddenly, a huge beam of white light shot out from it. It was extremely swift and instantly slammed against Yang Ye’s sword.

Bang!

Yang Ye’s sword shook violently while his figure was blasted away.

The middle aged man was just about to follow up with another attack, but a shrill cry suddenly resounded from afar. He looked over and saw a blood red hole stabbed open on the forehead of an Emperor from the World Devastator Cult. Moreover, the 7 Emperors from the World Devastator Cult had been reduced to 4 now. The sight of this made the middle aged man clench his fists while ferocity flashed through his eyes.

He didn’t attack, and he just waved his hand and said, “Retreat!”

The World Devastator Cult had lost the advantage it had, so refusing to retreat would only cause the remaining Emperors to die as well. Even though the World Devastator Cult was extremely strong, it wasn’t so strong that it was filled with Emperors. Every single Emperor was a pillar of support for the World Devastator Cult!

The Emperors hesitated for a moment when they heard the middle aged man, and then they turned around and fled.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly stomped his right foot down and transformed into a ray of blood red light as he vanished on the spot. He was around 10km away when his figure appeared again, and an Emperor from the World Devastator Cult was behind him.

Hiss!

A strand of blood sprayed from the center of that Emperor’s forehead, and then that Emperor’s corpse vanished just a moment later.

“How dare you!” A vicious glow flashed through the eyes of the World Devastator Cult’s leader. His figure flashed and instantly appeared before Yang Ye, and then he swung his fan at Yang Ye.

Yang Ye had intended to pursue the other Emperors, but he had no choice but to stop now. He instantly drew his sword and swung it at the middle aged man. Even though the leader of the World Devastator Cult was an Emperor as well, he was no ordinary Emperor. He was extremely strong to the point that even Yang Ye didn’t dare to act carelessly or underestimate him in the slightest.

Bang!

The fan and sword collided, and then the middle aged man was blasted around 300m away.

If it was a competition of physical strength, then even the middle aged man couldn’t compare to Yang Ye. It could be said that very few amongst the humans could compete with Yang Ye when it came to physical strength.

After he pushed the middle aged man back, Yang Ye’s figure transformed into a ray of light that entered the expanse of space before him. He was over 50km away when his figure emerged again, and an Emperor of the World Devastator Cult wasn’t too far ahead of him.

That Emperor was horrified when he saw Yang Ye chasing after him, but it didn’t take long for a wisp of viciousness and resolve to flash through his eyes. After that, his stomach instantly started to expand!

Self detonation!

It was his only choice!

Fight? He couldn’t resist a single swing of Yang Ye’s sword! Flee? The facts proved that Yang Ye’s speed far surpassed his!

The only thing he could do was try to bring Yang Ye down with him!

However, his stomach had only just swelled up when Yang Ye vanished on the spot, and Yang Ye was behind him when his figure appeared once more. Moreover, there was a hole in his stomach.

Pu!

A fountain of blood surged out from his stomach, and his stomach seemed like a ball that had a hole punctured in it. It instantly shrunk back down.

Just a moment passed before a ray of light shot through the back of that Emperor’s head, and then the color in his eyes faded.

Meanwhile, the leader of the World Devastator Cult appeared in the distance, and a ferocious expression instantly arose on his face when he witnessed the scene before him, “How ruthless of you! Yang Ye! My World Devastator Cult won’t rest until your Sword Alliance is gone!” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Yang Ye waved his right hand and put the corpse away, “You won’t rest until my Sword Alliance is gone? You’re only prepared to do that now? My Sword Alliance was already prepared to do that from the moment all of you appeared outside Doomsday City.”

As soon as Yang Ye finished speaking, his figure transformed into a ray of light that entered the expanse of space before him.

“Don’t you dare!” The middle aged man’s expression changed drastically, and he vanished on the spot.

Over 100,000km away, the middle aged man had just emerged from within space when he heard a shrill cry resound. He looked up and saw blood spraying from the center of the forehead of the last remaining Emperor from the World Devastator Cult.

Yang Ye cracked an evil smile, “Sorry, you’re too late again!”

As soon as Yang Ye finished speaking, he waved his right hand and put the corpse away. After that, he started walking step by step towards the middle aged man, “A very long time ago, I told the members of your World Devastator Cult that my Sword Alliance doesn’t want to cause trouble or become enemies with you. Unfortunately, you ignored us and insisted on destroying us. You regret that now? It’s too late!”

As soon as Yang Ye finished speaking, he stomped his foot down and shot forward. He arrived before the middle aged man in an instant, and then he grabbed his sword with both hands and swung it down at the middle aged man!

A ferocious gaze glanced through the middle aged man’s eyes as he swiftly slammed his right palm down.

Bang!

The space around him instantly started to tremble. It seemed like boiling water. A moment later, the middle aged man slapped his right palm forward in Yang Ye’s direction.

“Heavenshaker!” A practically translucent energy palm flashed out of his palm while he spoke, and then the space around him started rippling violently. At the same time, the mountains in an area of thousands of kilometers collapsed from the force of it!

It was a peak Emperor Rank technique at the very least!

Yang Ye’s blood red pupils constricted at the sight of the energy palm. He quickly sheathed his blood red sword, circulated the remaining bits of profound energy within him, and then drew his sword swiftly. A beam of blood red sword energy shot forward.

200 overlapped Heavenrends!

The energy palm and sword energy collided, and then a moment of silence ensued.

Bang!

Suddenly, a terrifying wave of energy swept out from between them. The wave of energy was extremely swift and instantly enveloped them within it. The wave of energy raged through the sky. Everywhere it passed, space collapsed inch by inch.

At a certain point in time, the space in the surroundings was transformed into a black hole that was completely pitch black. But it didn’t take long for space to be restored by a mysterious force, but the wave of energy was still raging through the surroundings.

It raged through the surroundings for almost an hour before it gradually dispersed.

Suddenly, coughing resounded here, and it didn’t take long for a man to stand up slowly from the ground.

It was the leader of the World Devastator Cult!

It was the middle aged man with the folding fan. He’d only just stood on his feet when he started spitting out mouthfuls of blood in succession. He looked down at his chest, and he saw that it was a mangled mess. Even the internal organs within him were faintly visible. His eyes narrowed slightly before he raised his head and looked towards the distance. A completely blood red figure was lying not too far away from him.

Yang Ye!

A wisp of viciousness flashed through his eyes when he saw that Yang Ye was still unconscious, and he started walking slowly in Yang Ye’s direction.

Suddenly, a white head emerged from Yang Ye’s chest. Snowy’s face instantly changed when she saw the middle aged man, and then she hurriedly went back into the pocket of space. But it didn’t take long for her to emerge once more. She wrapped her arms around Yang Ye’s head and shook it with all her might, but Yang Ye still didn’t wake up after a while of shaking.

As she watched the middle aged man grow closer and closer, Snowy became so anxious that she started to cry, but her tears were tears of spirit energy....

Yang Ye still remained unconscious.

Meanwhile, the middle aged man was just over a meter away from Yang Ye. He raised his right hand slowly and was about to attack.

Suddenly, Snowy flew over and obstructed his path. She waved her claws swiftly and a few hundred violet crystals appeared before the middle aged man while she gazed pleadingly at him.

“Don’t worry, I’ll let you keep him company!” As soon as he finished speaking, he slapped his palm down in Snowy and Yang Ye’s direction.

Snowy’s eyes opened wide while her hairs stood on end. She turned around and shot over to Yang Ye’s chest. She held tightly onto Yang Ye’s throat, and her figure shook violently. She was extremely afraid.

However, she didn’t return into the pocket of space.
