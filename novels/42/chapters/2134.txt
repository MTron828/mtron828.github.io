Chapter 2135 – An Nanjing’s Strength!

The Martial Soul Beast was leaving!

The Martial Soul Beast of Martial Emperor Academy had been tricked to leave with someone else!

The Vice Dean glanced at Yang Ye with an extremely hostile expression on his face.

Yang Ye was quite embarrassed as well. Actually, he’d just said that for fun, but he hadn’t expected it to actually agree. All of this was Snowy’s fault, it had nothing to do with him!

Meanwhile, Snowy patted the Martial Soul Beast on the head and seemed like she was telling it that it would be by her side from now on.

The Martial Soul Beast nodded repeatedly to display that it was absolutely willing.

Actually, if it was at any other time, it may not choose to go with Snowy. Yet now, in this era where spirit energy was gradually becoming scarce, all of these sentient beings and even all Sprites sensed danger. It was danger that came from the depletion of spirit energy. So, they were most fond of staying by a Sprite Lord’s side.

Just like that, Snowy had successfully tricked a little fellow to go with them.

Suddenly, an aura seeped out from within Martial Emperor Cavern, but it didn’t take long for it to gradually shrink back like a receding tide.

Yang Ye gazed at the Vice Dean, “What was that?”

The Vice Dean replied, “She’s probably about to come outside.”

Meanwhile, countless auras flashed over from the surroundings, and it didn’t take long for a few dozen people to be gathered here.

“Senior Sister An is finally coming out!” Someone spoke abruptly with slight excitement.

“Senior Sister An is the most monstrous genius in the last one thousand years of our academy’s history. I think even Sages won’t be able to harm her now!”

“Sages? Ptooey! Can Sages even be compared to her now? She could already fight Sages before she went in there. Now, I’m afraid she can even defeat Sages!”

Yang Ye gazed at the cave entrance in the distance, can she really defeat Sages now?

A woman walked out slowly from within the cave while everyone watched from the surroundings.

A white robe, a ponytail, and a spear.

It was An Nanjing.

Yang Ye was about to go over when a man in an embroidered robe appeared in front of her. He grinned and said, “Junior Sister An, congratulations.”

An Nanjing glanced at the man, and then she gazed at Yang Ye. After that, she walked around the man and walked over to Yang Ye, “You’re here!”

A smile couldn’t help but curl up on Yang Ye’s face.

An Nanjing!

It was the same An Nanjing he’d known! Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Meanwhile, the man in an embroidered robe had quite an unsightly expression on his face.

Yang Ye said, “How’s your strength like now?”

Her eyelids rose up slightly, “Wanna try?”

Yang Ye smiled, “Of course!”

They turned around and left together.

Everyone here was stunned by this scene.

They knew her temper well, and she was an utter block of ice. Anyone who got close to her would feel a wave of coldness assault them, and they would be ignored. Yet now, she was actually speaking to a man, and she’d said so much to him.

What the hell?

Suddenly, the man from before appeared in front of Yang Ye and An Nanjing.

Yang Ye gazed at him, “Hmm?”

The man grinned, “Brother, you are?”

Yang Ye replied, “Her friend.”

“Her friend?” The man glanced at Yang Ye and gazed at An Nanjing. He was about to speak when An Nanjing suddenly said, “Don’t disturb us again.”

She gazed at Yang Ye and said, “Let’s go!”

Yang Ye nodded, and they walked away. However, Yang Ye suddenly stopped and looked at the man from before, “She’s mine, so don’t even think about it.”

Yang Ye turned around and left.

“Yours?” Meanwhile, the man suddenly appeared in front of Yang Ye, “Don’t you think that sounds like a huge joke?”

Yang Ye replied indifferently, “A joke? I never joke.”

The man looked Yang Ye in the eyes for a long time and said, “You look very confident. So, how about we have a little spar?”

Yang Ye was about to speak when the Vice Dean suddenly appeared in front of Yang Ye. He gazed at Yang Ye and said, “Just ignore these juniors.”

Yang Ye shrugged and vanished on the spot.

Meanwhile, the Vice Dean glanced at the man in an embroidered robe and said, “I’m afraid she has no one but him in her eyes.”

“He’s not worthy of her!” The man spoke in a low voice, “A man like him…”

“He’s Yang Ye!” Meanwhile, the Vice Dean spoke abruptly.

“What?!” The man suddenly turned to look at the Vice Dean while disbelief filled his eyes.

The Vice Dean shook his head slightly, “Don’t go offending that fellow.”

He turned around and left.

The man still remained stunned on the spot.

…

Yang Ye and An Nanjing arrived high above in the sky, and they created a pocket of space there.

Yang Ye’s eyes were filled with the desire to battle as he gazed at An Nanjing.

They didn’t say a word. An Nanjing just suddenly vanished on the spot, and then a wave of force slammed at Yang Ye. Yang Ye didn’t choose to dodge it, he just slammed his fist forward too. However, right when it was about to slam against An Nanjing’s fist, she suddenly unfurled her fist and grabbed his wrist.

Crack!

The bones in Yang Ye’s wrist instantly shattered, but at the exact same instant, Yang Ye’s foot had shot towards An Nanjing’s stomach. However, at the instant he raised his leg, An Nanjing’s leg had already slammed against his knee, causing him to be blasted over 300m away.

As soon as Yang Ye stopped himself, she was already in front of him, and then she kneed him.

The space around Yang Ye instantly shattered, and the powerful force contained within it caused Yang Ye’s entire body to became tense. At the same time, he sensed a wave of powerful pressure.

Yang Ye didn’t dare act carelessly at all. He raised his right foot and took a small step back before clenching his right fist, and then he slammed it forward.

However, An Nanjing didn’t go head-on against him!

An Nanjing suddenly twisted her body sideways when Yang Ye’s fist slammed forward, and she dodged it. At the same time, she swept her arm like a rod at Yang Ye’s stomach.

Bang!

Yang Ye’s figure curled forward, but he grabbed her throat with one of his hands!

Meanwhile, a smile curled up on her face. An instant later, her figure vanished on the spot.

Crap! Yang Ye cried inwardly. Sure enough, a fist slammed against his back.

Bang!

Yang Ye’s figure was blasted away.

At the same instant, An Nanjing tapped his right foot down and shot forward. Her right knee shot towards Yang Ye’s back. If it struck him, Yang Ye would be heavily injured even if he avoided death.

Suddenly, Yang Ye stopped in midair, and then he turned around and slammed his fist at her knee!

A head-on collision!

Unfortunately, she still didn’t go head-on against him. As soon as he swung his fist forward, she’d suddenly pulled her knee back, and then slapped her palm against his fist.

At the instant her palm came into contact with Yang Ye’s fist, a smile curled up on his face, and then a wave of powerful force surged out from his fist.

Bang!

An Nanjing was caught off guard and blasted over 1km away.

Once she stopped herself, she put her right hand behind her back and gazed at Yang Ye, “Your body is at the Sage Realm.”

Yang Ye nodded, “If it wasn’t for that, I wouldn’t even be able to exchange 10 blows with you in close quarters!”

Both An Nanjing and him hadn’t used their true strength, and they’d chosen this method to compete against each other. They’d chosen to compete in the basics. Unfortunately, he was completely suppressed by her. After all, his body was at the Sage Realm, but her strength was entirely capable of injuring him.

An Nanjing walked slowly to him, “Your combat instinct is very bad!”

Very bad!

Yang Ye’s face was quite unsightly.

His combat instinct was very bad!

It was the first time someone had said that to him. After all, close quarter combat was one of Yang Ye’s strongpoints, and he’d never suffered a loss while engaging in close quarter combat with others. Of course, this spar was excluded from that.

Meanwhile, An Nanjing continued, “However, your body is very strong, and your recovery is very formidable too. Sages are probably no match for you in close quarter combat. However, if you encounter an expert with extraordinary combat instinct, you’ll definitely suffer a loss.”

Yang Ye nodded. From the moment An Nanjing broke his wrist just now, he’d known what his weakness was. Even though he’d relied on the Primordial Violet Energy to heal his wrist, even a small thing in a battle between experts could decide a person’s fate.

“Moreover!” An Nanjing added, “Your physical strength is quite weak!”

“It’s weak?” Yang Ye wasn’t convinced, “It should be pretty good, right?”

An Nanjing shook her head slightly, “A Sage Realm body’s strength shouldn’t be like this. Your physical strength isn’t bad at all when it comes to converging strength. However, you lack something.”

Yang Ye asked, “What?”

An Nanjing replied, “Condensing it!”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Condensing it?”

She explained, “Like a piece of metal. Doesn’t it grow sharper and stronger after being struck countless times by a hammer?”

Yang Ye frowned when he heard this.

Meanwhile, An Nanjing added, “You must condense your strength and make it even purer, truly pure, just like your sword. I can sense that your sword is pure, but your physical strength isn’t. If you don’t use your sword, I can fight 100 people like you!”

Yang Ye was stunned speechless.
