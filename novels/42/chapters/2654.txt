Chapter 2655 – Isn’t That My Sword?

Snowy followed the woman in black back to the wooden house, and then she started to send spirit energy to the woman.

After she became a true Sprite Progenitor, Snowy’s spirit energy was theoretically one of the purest in the world.

Actually, the woman in black possessed a heaven defying form of restorative energy, but she needed to absorb pure spirit energy before she could convert it into her own type of energy. Snowy’s spirit energy was undoubtedly the best choice.

Because her spirit energy was very pure, and she could save quite a bit of time with Snowy’s help.

In the wooden house.

The two of them stared at each other.

A short while later, the woman in black spoke indifferently, “Let’s begin!”

Snowy blinked, and then she nodded and opened her little mouth. She was about to spit out spirit energy when the woman suddenly shook her head, “That’s a bad method. I’ll teach you a way to control spirit energy.”

Snowy looked up at her, and she drew a circle with her right hand, “Can you sense this small space?”

Snowy closed her eyes slowly as Yang Ye would always do, and a short while passed before she opened them again and nodded.

The woman in black said, “You’re the Sprite Progenitor, so you have a unique physique too. You’re able to attract all things. You can sense all things, and then make use of their energy.”

Snowy blinked, and then she waved her claw. She was asking what she should do next!

The woman in black said, “A Domain. Understand?”

Yang Ye was quite excited. She took the woman’s black sword and started waving it lightly. She was trying to say that she understood, and she could create the Sword Domain too.

The woman in black gazed at Snowy for a long time before she shook her head, “His Sword Domain is trash. Don’t learn it. You must learn the Sprite Domain, understand? Use spirit energy to form a Domain. Right, it means that with just a snap of your fingers, the spirit energy throughout your Domain will vanish, and so will the spirit energy within the bodies of others. Understand?”

Snowy gazed at her while seeming to understand yet not completely.

She said, “Give it a try?”

Snowy nodded lightly and closed her eyes. Meanwhile, the woman said, “Sense the spirit energy around you, you can sense them with ease, then control them. Tell them to obey you…”

As soon as she finished speaking, the spirit energy in the wooden house and outside it suddenly fluctuated.

The woman glanced at the surroundings and continued, “Spirit energy exists in Three Dimensional Space, and it’s an irreplaceable part of Three Dimensional Space. It can be said that it’s the Three Dimensional Universe’s true quintessence. If you can truly take control of spirit energy and use them to…”

She seemed to have thought of something at this point and didn’t continue.

A very, very long time ago, that existence who was equally famous with the ancient beast of evil was able to cause intense changes in the Three Dimensional Universe’s spirit energy with just a thought.

Even she and her other forms couldn’t control all the spirit energy in the Three Dimensional Universe.

But the little fellow before her could accomplish that.

Snowy possessed a unique physique that had an absolute force of attraction toward the spirit energy of this world. So, it was absolutely easy for her to take control of them.

At this moment, the spirit energy around the wooden hour was already changing.

The spirit energy was converging to the wooden house, and they formed a huge vortex of spirit energy around it. In just a short while, the spirit energy had formed a huge white ball, and then the white ball started to roll in the air.

The woman in black glanced indifferently at the surroundings and gazed at Snowy, “Can you stop playing?”

Snowy gazed at her and was slightly puzzled.

She waved her right hand, and the spirit energy instantly vanished without a trace.

Snowy was stunned.

She spoke coldly, “I asked you to sense them and use them to form a Domain, but you are converging them to play ball with you?”

Snowy was quite guilty.

She spoke coldly again, “Continue. If you play around again, I’ll kill Yang Ye and let you play with him!”

Snowy’s expression changed. She glared angrily at the woman in black, but the woman ignored her furious gaze, “I won’t just kill him, I’ll kill everything in here.”

She pinched Snowy’s chubby cheeks and said, “What are you looking at? You’re no match for me!”

Snowy was slightly dejected. In the end, she started to practice the Domain under the influence of her threats…

This time, she didn’t dare to play around again.

Outside the Primordial Pagoda.

Yang Ye shot through the boundless darkness for a long time yet still couldn’t see the way out.

At this moment, he wasn’t at the Origin World at all.

He’d naturally tried asking the woman, but the answers he obtained were extremely depressing. Because even she didn’t know where they were, and she wanted him to find a way outside.VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

According to Yang Ye’s inference, she should have been fighting with Qi Bitian and Tian Xiu, and she arrived here by chance during the battle… So, the real question was what this place was?

He urgently wanted to leave this place because the woman in black was within him!

So long as he went to the End World, those fellows there would be dead!

All of them would be dead!

Just thinking about their reactions when they see him bring the woman in black to the End World made him unable to control his excitement.

You’re hiding from Destiny?

I’m going to bring Destiny to you!

Yang Ye shot forward even more quickly.

Two hours later, Yang Ye returned to the Primordial Pagoda.

He went over to the wooden house. Snowy glanced at him and was about to rush over, but the woman in black glanced coldly at Snowy. Snowy obediently moved aside and started comprehending again.

She couldn’t play or go outside until she could form the Sprite Domain… She was finished right now.

Yang Ye glanced at Snowy and asked, “What are you teaching her?”

He knew a little about what was going on between the woman and Snowy, but he didn’t know much.

She frowned slightly, “Does it have anything to do with you?”

The corners of Yang Ye’s mouth twitched. Why is she so difficult to get along with? She’s like the complete opposite of the woman in white!

Yang Ye tried hard to keep himself calm because if he couldn’t, she would beat him up until he did.

She was the most violent woman he’d ever met.

Yang Ye said, “I can’t find a way out of this place. It’s boundless, and there are no ways out!” Even if he had the Myriad World Diagram, it couldn’t help him at all because it couldn’t teleport him out of this place! He was at a loss for what to do!

She gazed at Yang Ye and remained silent.

Yang Ye laughed bitterly, “Being trapped here won’t do us any good, right?”

She shot a glance into the sky, and then she gradually frowned.

Yang Ye’s heart shook from the sight of this, “What is it?”

The woman in black fell silent for a short while and said, “The 8th layer of space.”

“The 8th layer of space?” Yang Ye frowned, “What the heck is that?”

She glanced at him and asked, “Why are you so stupid?”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

She glanced coldly at him and said, “There is a certain distance between Three Dimensional Space and Four Dimensional Space. There are nine layers of space in that gap, or as the people outside say, it’s the nine heavens. You’re in the 8th now, and the 9th is above.”

Yang Ye was stunned and asked, “So can I reach the Four Dimensional Universe by passing through the 9th level?”

She replied indifferently, “You’d arrive at the border of the Four Dimensional Universe…”

She glanced at Yang Ye and continued, “Why? You want to go up there?”

Yang Ye smiled embarrassedly, “Why don’t we try?”

She ridiculed, “Go try it then!”

Yang Ye felt quite helpless, “Can you stop being so sarcastic?”

She pointed at the sky, “Peak Destiny Realm experts are rarely able to get to the 8th level, and those able to get to the 9th level are rarely seen in history. Based on your current strength, let’s forget about going up, even going down will be a problem. You think you can even go up? Why don’t you just ascend to heaven then?”

Yang Ye was stunned speechless.

Meanwhile, Snowy blinked and continued her comprehension… The woman in black was very difficult to talk to, so Snowy felt that it was best not to provoke her.

Yang Ye felt very helpless, “Then what do you want me to do? We can’t just remain trapped here forever, right?”

She replied indifferently, “I don’t really care!”

Yang Ye spoke slowly, “Is that so? You know… I saw a huge vortex earlier, and there was a pair of eyes in there. I wonder what the heck that was… and I wonder if it will appear again!”

Her eyes narrowed slightly. A short while later, she glanced at Yang Ye, “It was here for me. However, I should warn you that if it finds out I’m in here, you’ll be the first to die!”

Yang Ye laughed bitterly, “Can we not try to harm each other? I can’t leave this place on my own, but I’m sure you can, right? So, why don’t you help?”

She fell silent for a moment and said, “Go to the 7th layer. I can help once you’re there.”

Yang Ye asked, “How do I get there?”

She replied, “Don’t you have the Sword Domain? Use it to break open the 8th layer of space.”

Yang Ye asked, “What if I get to the 9th layer?”

She laughed coldly, “I’m sorry but you can’t accomplish that.”

Yang Ye puckered his lips and turned around with the intent to leave. Meanwhile, Snowy suddenly flew over to him, cracked a smile, and then revealed a pitch black sword as if it was magic!

A black sword!

Yang Ye was stunned.

Snowy raised the black sword in Yang Ye’s direction while complacency covered her face.

Meanwhile, the woman in black suddenly said, “Excuse me, but I think that’s mine, right?”

Snowy blinked.
