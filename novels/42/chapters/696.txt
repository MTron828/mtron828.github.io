Chapter 697 – Don’t Be Shy!

Yang Ye wasn’t a man with no desire, so he naturally reacted. But while his body reacted, his consciousness remained completely clear.

The woman’s smile and allure grew even greater when she noticed Yang Ye’s reaction.

However, while Yang Ye’s heart remained tranquil, his expression had changed slightly. Meanwhile, the woman’s face started blushing a little. She seemed like a blooming peach blossom. Moreover, her eyes were even filled with the glow of desire.

The atmosphere here became quite unusual!

Her hands moved faster and faster, and their breathing grew heavier and heavier!

“Fu Jinxian! You’re courting death!” Right at this moment, a furious shout suddenly resounded from outside, and then an enormous red hammer tore through the air and instantly arrived behind the woman.

Her expression changed slightly, and the allure in her eyes instantly transformed into icy coldness. At the same time, her hand stopped moving. She turned around and stretched out her fair hand, and a pink silk ribbon shot forward like a bolt of lightning and collided with the hammer.

Bang!

An enormous explosion resounded, and then both the ribbon and the hammer were blasted backward.

In next to no time, Xiaoman arrived within the room.

The woman glanced at Xiaoman, and a trace of fear appeared in her eyes. But it wasn’t long before she cracked a smile and said, “So it’s Xiaoman. Big Sister has no ill intent. I just wanted to see how long this man of yours is able to last. Hehe.... It isn’t bad. He was actually able to persist for so long. He’s much better than those other men of mine. Xiaoman, you’re really quite blessed!”

Xiaoman tightened her grip on her hammers while killing intent surged through her eyes. On the other hand, the woman revealed vigilance in her eyes while her profound energy circulated within her. The atmosphere was quite tense.

A short moment passed before Xiaoman suddenly took a deep breath, and she said, “Fu Jinxian, he’s mine. You’re not allowed to target him, or I’ll definitely smash your head apart!”

Fu Jinxian laughed coldly and said, “Don’t blame me if you can’t keep him protected!”

“Fu! Jin! Xian!” Xiaoman stared fixedly at her and said, “I’ll smash those melons of yours into pieces if you dare to say another fucking word!”

At this moment, Xiaoman’s entire body surged with fiery red flames, and the hammers in her hands were even spinning swiftly.

The corners of Fu Jinxian’s mouth moved a little when she saw Xiaoman on the verge of going berserk, but she didn’t dare say anything in the end. She just glanced coldly at Xiaoman, and then she took a glance at Yang Ye before turning around and leaving.

Xiaoman finally calmed down a short while after Fu Jinxian left, and then she gazed at Yang Ye who was still on the bed, “You know, you would be dead if I arrived a little later!”

“Why?” Yang Ye’s voice was very calm.

She replied, “She loves to wait until a man is at his happiest moment, and then....” When she spoke up to this point, she made a cutting motion with her hand and said, “And cut it off!”

Yang Ye couldn’t help but break out in cold sweat. Because if she really did that in his current state, then he wouldn’t be able to resist at all. Yang Ye calmed himself before he asked, “There’s no enmity between us, so why did she target me?” This was what puzzled him the most. Because it was the first time that he’d met her, and there was no enmity between them at all! However, she actually wanted to end his line....

Xiaoman pondered deeply for a moment before she said, “She does that to every human man!”

Yang Ye didn’t want to inquire further, and he immediately said, “I’ll kill her!” He didn’t know why she hated humans, and he didn’t want to know as well. All he knew was that she’d almost made him a eunuch! 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Xiaoman suddenly said, “She’s my cousin sister!”

Yang Ye was stunned, but it wasn’t long before he said, “I’ll still kill her!”

Xiaoman glanced at him before she said, “She’s a pitiable person. She once went up to the surface with her husband and son to sightsee, but they encountered members of the human race. Those fellows killed her husband and son before her, and then humiliated her. Since that day, she has been living solely for the sake of revenge, and she killed every human she met since then. In the end, my grandfather was afraid that she would encounter an expert from the human race, so he forbade her from leaving our territory.”

Yang Ye fell silent.

Xiaoman waved her hammers and said, “She’s at the fifth rank of the Monarch Realm, and so am I. However, she can’t defeat me, and I don’t want to fight her. Because she was very good to me in the past. Most importantly, you can’t defeat her at all, and going to seek revenge is no different than giving your life away. So, just let it go, alright? In any case, you didn’t lose anything, and I won’t make a fuss about it!”

Yang Ye was very speechless. He could be said to be completely defeated by her strange thought process!

“I’ll take your silence as your agreement!” said Xiaoman.

Yang Ye fell silent for a while before he said, “What if she intends to act against me again?”

Xiaoman patted him on the shoulder and spoke while putting on a heroic air, “Don’t worry, I’ll protect you!”

Yang Ye was speechless.

Xiaoman continued, “However, you’re still too weak, and I can’t be by your side at all times to protect you. So, I’ve decided to provide you with guidance once you’ve recovered, and then I’ll ask grandfather for a few thousand Firecrystals to help you attain the Monarch Realm. Once you attain the Monarch Realm, then it wouldn’t be that easy for Fu Jinxian to kill you!”

Yang Ye glanced at her when he heard this, and he said, “Miss Xiaoman, no matter what, I’ll remember this kindness. If you say that I shouldn’t kill Fu Jinxian, then I won’t!”

Xiaoman suddenly walked over to him and slapped his shoulder forcefully, “What are you talking about? You’ll be my man in the future. If I don’t be nice to my own man, then should I be nice to other men? Moreover, as you humans say, that’s like treating me like an outsider. I don’t like it when you do that. So, don’t say such things to me in the future or I’ll hammer you!

Yang Ye laughed bitterly while he said to himself, you’ll probably really hammer me if you found out about my true identity.

After all, while there was no enmity between him and the Fire Spirit Race, the Fire Spirit Race was allied with his enemy, the Hallowed Halls. So, if he were to enter into battle with the experts of the Hallowed Halls, then the Fire Spirit Race would probably help the Hallowed Halls!

He felt that it was a problem! Because he didn’t want to do anything which would hurt Xiaoman!

Meanwhile, Xiaoman suddenly started to remove Yang Ye’s clothes.

Yang Ye was stunned, and then he spoke with shock, “What are you doing? You intend to complete the wedding night ceremony now? You can’t be serious, right?”

Xiaoman removed his clothes as she said, “You should be able to walk now. So, we’ll get married tonight! Now, let me help you change! Don’t be shy. I won’t take advantage of you until we’re married!

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.
