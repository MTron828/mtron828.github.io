Chapter 2516 – Instant Kill!

The young man glanced at Yang Ye when he heard him, “Really?”

Yang Ye grinned, and then he tapped his right foot against the ground.

Hiss!

He transformed into a ray of light that shot forward.

At the moment Yang Ye vanished, the young man suddenly stretched out a hand and made a grasping motion. He immediately grasped the tip of Yang Ye’s sword.

Yang Ye twisted his sword with both hands.

Hiss!

The sword twisted free of the young man’s grasp and stabbed against his chest, but the sword couldn’t pierce through him at all!

The young man’s body had forcefully resisted the attack!

Yang Ye immediately changed his attack and swung his sword horizontally against the young man’s neck.

Clang!

A clear and loud clang resounded, and then Yang Ye’s sword shook and was bounced back.

Meanwhile, the young man pressed forward and slammed his fist at Yang Ye!

Bang!

Yang Ye was blasted 300m back!

At the instant Yang Ye was pushed back, two swords shot at the young man’s neck. However, they had merely sliced half an inch deep before he grabbed them, rendering them immobile!

Suddenly, a sword shot at the man’s forehead.

The young man frowned slightly, and he retreated around 30m back. Meanwhile, he hurled the swords at Yang Ye.

Hiss! Hiss!

The swords shot at Yang Ye!

There was no sword intent or sword energy within them, but they had pure strength and speed!

They were still extremely powerful!

Meanwhile, the Sword Gourd trembled by Yang Ye’s waist, and then the swords flew back into it.

The young man glanced at the gourd on Yang Ye’s waist and said, “You have many Divine Treasures!”

Yang Ye shrugged and glanced at the surroundings. He couldn’t sense any auras in the surroundings, but that didn’t mean there was no one there. It represented that the people in the surroundings possessed strength that far surpassed his own! They may even be Lord Realm experts or experts above the Lord Realm!

If he used the Myriad World Diagram to lock down the area, the young man before him would definitely return to his true form. Moreover, the people watching from the shadows were likely to take action as well!

At that time, even if he could kill this guy, he wouldn’t be able to escape!

Yang Ye shook his head and smiled a short while later. Why think so much about it? I’ll just kill him first!

As soon as he thought up to this point, Yang Ye waved his right hand, and the Myriad Sword Diagram appeared. Right when Yang Ye was about to activate it and lock down the area, around 100 auras descended from the distant sky.

Yang Ye looked over and saw Xing Biqing’s group.

Meanwhile, countless demons emerged from the city. They surrounded Yang Ye and the other human cultivators.

War would break out at any moment!

The young man before him nodded slightly, “You’re all here?”

Xing Biqing walked over to Yang Ye’s side and said, “His name is Yao Qing, he’s the second strongest expert in the demon race’s younger generation.”

The second!

Yang Ye asked, “There’s someone stronger?”

Xing Biqing nodded, “That demon is slightly stronger than him. However, I’ve never seen him in battle, and I finally witnessed him in battle when they attacked the city. He was very strong.”

Yang Ye shot a glance into the city. Now, the hidden geniuses throughout War Dimension had started to show themselves!

Meanwhile, Xing Biqing said, “Let’s retreat for now!”

As she spoke, she was about to leave with the others, but Yao Qing suddenly pointed at Yang Ye, “Everyone else can leave, but you can’t!”

Xing Biqing and the others’ expressions instantly turned gloomy.Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Xing Biqing was about to say something when Yang Ye suddenly tapped his finger forward, and the Myriad World Diagram enveloped the surroundings. Or to be more precise, it enveloped Yao Qing and the other demons outside the city!

In the Myriad World Diagram, Yang Ye smiled ferociously, “Primordial Pagoda! Sword Scroll! Help me seal off everything within this area. Don’t let anyone’s divine sense enter!”

As soon as he finished speaking, an ethereal pagoda appeared, and then countless rays of golden light swept out and enveloped the area.

The Primordial Pagoda was a Quasi Super Divine Treasure, so the divine senses of most people couldn’t enter this area without being detected now!

Especially when it was assisted by Sword Scroll. It could be said that unless someone broke into the area by force, then the people outside would never be able to witness the scene in here. Of course, it wasn’t absolutely certain. However, Yang Ye couldn’t be bothered about that right now.

He planned to kill first!

It was part of his terrible temper!

Yao Qing gazed at Yang Ye and spoke indifferently, “You finally plan to fight seriously? Come, let me see how…”

Suddenly, a wave of mysterious energy enveloped the area.

The Sword Domain!

At this moment, the space throughout the Myriad Sword Diagram was enveloped within the Sword Domain!

Yao Qing’s expression changed when he noticed this. At this moment, the other demons had quite solemn expressions on their faces. Obviously, they sensed danger.

Suddenly, two flying swords struck Yao Qing’s neck on both sides!

Hiss!

The swords sliced half an inch deep and caused blood to spray!

Yao Qing’s expression changed drastically, and a powerful aura swept out from within him. His body started to expand, and he was about to return to his true form. But right at this moment, Yang Ye appeared before him, and then a sword slashed down!

At the critical moment, Yao Qing stopped his transformation. Because as far as he was concerned, he could resist Yang Ye’s attack with his current physical defenses. Because he’d done so countless times before!

However, he hadn’t thought of the fact that they weren’t outside anymore, and Yang Ye’s sword wasn’t the same sword he’d been using previously!

It was Executor!

The number one sword of Eternal Kingdom!

Yang Ye’s sword descended, and Yao Qing didn’t dodge at all. Moreover, his true form had appeared.

However, right when his true form was about to be completed, the sword descended.

Hiss!

It was like a chopper slicing through tofu! It went all the way down!

Countless demons in the surroundings watched as the sword sliced Yao Qing’s true form into two.

He’d been sliced into two!

Yao Qing’s corpse fell to the ground. His eyes were wide open, and he could be said to have died with everlasting regret!

Even at the moment of his death, he couldn’t figure out why there was such a huge difference in this sword cultivator’s strength once they were in here!

It could be described as being a difference as huge as the gap between the heavens and the earth!

As for the other demons, they were completely stunned!

He was dead? Just like that?

It didn’t take long for them to recover from their shock, and they were about to flee. However, two flying swords soundlessly appeared before them.

In just a few breaths of time, the 30 or so demon beasts in the surroundings had lost their heads!

Yang Ye waved his right hand, and he obtained all their inner cores!

The Myriad World Diagram and Primordial Pagoda vanished, and then Yang Ye and all the corpses appeared before everyone.

All the human cultivators were flabbergasted when they saw all the corpses!

Even Xing Biqing and Ye Zhibei were stunned on the spot!

All of them are dead?

Yao Qing was a Five World Realm demon, and the other demons were at the Three and Four World Realms. But all of them had been killed in less than 10 minutes?

Everyone was shocked by this scene!

Deathly silence filled the surroundings!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye gazed at Xing Biqing, “Let’s go!”

Xing Biqing was stunned and said, “Why? Let’s head inside!”

Head inside the city!

At this moment, countless behind her were surging with excitement.

Enter the city!

All of them wanted to enter the city!

Yang Ye had raised their morale, and it could be said that the demon beasts’ morale was at its lowest! So, there wasn’t a better time to enter the city!

However, a powerful aura suddenly swept out from within the city, and then numerous demons leaped out from inside the city!

Every one of them was a peak Five World Realm demon beast!

There were 8 of them!

Besides that, countless other demon beasts were charging out of the city!

Besides that, Yang Ye and the others sensed a faint strand of pressure that enveloped all of them!

Yang Ye shot a glance deep into the city and said, “Let’s retreat for now!”

He wasn’t afraid, but his intuition told him that if they charged in, then besides experts on par with him, Xing Biqing, and Ye Zhibei, the rest would probably not survive.

Xing Biqing fell silent for a moment, and then she nodded. Just like that, their group retreated.

As for the demon beasts, they seemed to be afraid of something and didn’t stop them!

Once Yang Ye’s group left, the demons carried the corpses outside the city back into the city.

Meanwhile, a man walked onto the city walls.

He gazed into the direction Yang Ye’s group had left toward and grinned, “Interesting.”

As he spoke, he gazed at Yao Qing’s corpse, “A lion must use its full strength, even when hunting a rabbit!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he glanced at the surroundings and said, “Please give me your help!”

He flicked 200 World Crystals into the air once he finished speaking.

It didn’t take long for Yao Qing’s corpse to actually start healing rapidly at a visible rate! In less than 10 breaths of time, his corpse had healed back into one. Moreover, his soul instantly condensed and returned to his body as well.

Around an hour later, Yao Qing opened his eyes.

Yao Qing stood up and walked over to the man, “I underestimated my opponent!”

The man spoke indifferently, “What did you see?”

Yao Qing was about to speak when the man added, “No matter what you saw, you can’t say anything about it!”

Yao Qing was puzzled, “Why?”

The man looked into the distance, “He knew that I entered that barrier of his, and so he chose to spare your life. It’s a deal we made, so you’ll be breaking the deal if you say anything about it!”

“But Lord Yao Ye…” Yao Qing wanted to say something.

The man shook his head, “Both humans and demons should keep their word. Not to mention that we aren’t irreconcilable enemies, so it isn’t necessary to go so far.”

He turned around and walked away.

Yao Qing fell silent for a long time, and then he turned around and left.

Thousands of kilometers away, Yang Ye shot a glance in War City’s direction.
