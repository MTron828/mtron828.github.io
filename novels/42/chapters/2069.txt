Chapter 2070 – Let’s Just Fight!

At the entrance to the Weapon Dimension, Elder Yuan stood there silently while looking in the direction Yang Ye had left towards.

A long time passed before a middle aged man appeared beside him.

It was Zhong Ye.

Elder Yuan waved the Inheritance Stone over to Zhong Ye and said, “The relationship between him and your Weapon Path has been completely severed!”

Zhong Ye gazed silently at the Inheritance Stone before him.

Elder Yuan turned around and left.

Zhong Ye remained silent on the spot for a long time, and then he gazed at the Inheritance Stone and said, “The Weapon Path is truly fucking useless!”

He vanished on the spot once he finished speaking.

…

In the clouds, Yang Ye stood atop one of the clouds and glanced at the surroundings. Where should he go now? He naturally couldn’t go back to Su Qingshi and the others. He was like a ball of flames that would burn anything that came close to him!

Now, his main objective was to improve his strength!

Of course, he had one more thing to do before that.

Yang Ye vanished into the sky.

The Prehistoric Ruins.

Yang Ye arrived in the Prehistoric Ruins again, or to be more precise, he’d arrived at the place where the mysterious ruins had been that day. However, there was nothing here.

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings. Suddenly, a circle of blue light appeared in front of Yang Ye. Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and walked in.

The circle of blue light trembled, and then it enveloped Yang Ye.

An instant later, Yang Ye appeared within the multicolored hall, and the casket was not too far away from him.

The voice resounded from within the casket, “You’ve come!”

Yang Ye nodded and withdrew a spatial ring, “There are quite a few immortal crystals in there. I’m not sure if they’re enough!”

He flicked the spatial ring over to the casket.

A short while passed before the voice within the casket said, “It’s enough for now!”

Yang Ye nodded, “Right, did someone get here in the past?”

“Yes, someone did!” The voice continued, “That person was much stronger than you, and he could be considered to be extremely formidable even in our era.”

Yang Ye asked, “Can you reveal what he came here for?”

The voice in the casket remained silent for a long time and said, “He made a deal with me!”

Yang Ye asked, “What deal?”

The voice replied, “Sorry but I can’t tell you!”

Yang Ye was quite disappointed. He glanced at the casket and said, “What’s your objective?”

The voice replied, “That isn’t what you should be worried about. You don’t seem to be in a very good situation!”

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly, “How did you know?”

The voice replied, “This won’t do. You can’t keep asking me all the questions.”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and replied, “Sorry, I’m just a little curious.” ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

The voice said, “Can you help me with something?”

Yang Ye asked, “What?”

Suddenly, four stellar maps appeared before Yang Ye, “These are four small worlds that my people sealed up all those years ago. There’s a sprite in every one of them. Can you help me bring them back? Of course, you’ll be compensated, and you’ll definitely be satisfied by it!”

Yang Ye spoke in a low voice, “Why don’t you do it yourself?”

“I wouldn’t be staying in this casket if I could leave.” The voice continued, “Human, I have no ill intent toward you. However, once I woke up, I noticed that this world of yours doesn’t really welcome my presence. Yet now, I can’t leave this place. I need to find the things that my people left behind, but if I go by myself, I’ll face a huge amount of trouble and may even get killed!”

Yang Ye thought for a long time and asked, “What’s the compensation? Let me make it clear that I have a lot of treasures, and they’re not ordinary. As for cultivation techniques, I don’t really need them. I have my own path in the Sword Dao to take!”

The voice said, “How about I help you attain the Zen Realm of your world?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “Can it be something else?”

The voice asked, “What do you want?”

Yang Ye raised his palm, and a pearl of blood appeared on it, “This is a Quintessence Blood Pearl of my second sister. Can you help bring her back to life?”

Blood Maiden!

How could Yang Ye have forgotten about her? In the lower universe, he’d been told to go look for the Buddhist Progenitor because the Buddhist Progenitor could revive her. However, because of the monkey, he’d been blacklisted by the Buddhist Path, so going to seek their help would be no different than asking for insult.

As for the Weapon Path, he’d asked Zhong Ye about it. However, the answer Zhong Ye gave him was that Zhong Ye couldn’t do anything about it. Moreover, Zhong Ye told him not to ask the Weapon Progenitor because reviving someone had a price to be paid!

To a certain extent, Blood Maiden was dead, but she couldn’t be considered to be completely dead. Because her Quintessence Blood Pearl was still here. In other words, it was possible to revive her. However, only progenitors were capable of such feats in this world!

But just as Zhong Ye had said, it had a cost to be paid, so why would they pay that price to revive Blood Maiden?

That was why he hadn’t asked the Weapon Progenitor for help.

Now, he’d finally found someone he could ask.

A long time passed before the voice resounded from within the casket, “I dare not guarantee that I’ll be able to succeed!”

Yang Ye was visibly relieved when he heard this, “How confident are you?”

“If you can find those four sprites for me, then I’ll have an 80% chance. If you only find one, I’ll have a 20% chance!” The voice continued, “I’m not trying to force you to find them, but I need them to help me recover my strength. The more strength I recover, the greater my chances will be.”

Yang Ye nodded, “I understand!”

Yang Ye turned around and started walking away.

Meanwhile, a thumb-sized blue gem appeared before Yang Ye, “An Origin Stone!”

Yang Ye asked, “What does it do?”

The voice explained, “If you encounter danger that you can’t deal with, you can crush it. It’ll instantly teleport you back here. Of course, those so-called progenitors of your world are able to stop it with ease. However, if experts at that level of cultivation want to kill you, then based on your current strength, you’ll definitely die no matter what!”

Yang Ye said, “Thank you!”

He vanished from the hall once he finished speaking.

The hall fell silent.

Once Yang Ye left, the mysterious building vanished. Yang Ye fell silent on the spot for a short while, and then he was about to leave when he suddenly turned around. There was a person seated cross-legged there.

That person had his back to him, so Yang Ye couldn’t see the person’s appearance.

The person suddenly said, “Young Brother, you received the favor of the Dao Progenitor, and now you’re come into contact with someone from before our history. Your fortune is truly extraordinary!”

Yang Ye glanced at the person and said, “I don’t know about fortune, but I have quite a bit of trouble. There are probably countless Sages waiting to kill me in the outside world.”

“That’s normal!” The person continued, “Where there is gain, there is a price to pay. It’s a principle that has remained for eternity.”

Yang Ye went straight to the point, “Are you here to kill me?”

The person replied, “Of course not. If I wanted to kill you, then perhaps only the Dao Progenitor himself can keep you safe.”

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly, “May I know which progenitor you are?”

The person replied, “That isn’t important. I came here just to see the person that the Dao Progenitor chose. While you aren’t what I expected, you do barely pass. I just never expected to see you entering that hall.”

Yang Ye spoke indifferently, “What are you trying to say? Or what do you want?”

The person chuckled, “Do you know the history of the people before our history?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “I don’t.”

The person replied, “I know a little. Always be on guard when working with them. That’s all I have to say.”

The person vanished into thin air once he finished speaking.

“Who is he?” Yang Ye frowned. A short while passed before he shook his head, restrained his thoughts, and vanished into the sky.

Not long after Yang Ye vanished, that person appeared here once more.

That person spoke softly, “The past is the past. Why interfere in the future?”

A long time passed before a voice resounded, “You’re part of the future, so why do you interfere in the past?”

That person fell silent.

A short while passed before that person spoke softly, “Chaos is about to descend upon the world. It isn’t just your people. The god race, the Moke, the Tianlan, and many other races who have been in hiding for countless years are gradually showing themselves… Fine, everyone has their own destiny, and it’s the same for every race. It will all depend on our own luck!”

The person vanished on the spot once he finished speaking.

The area fell silent again.

Yang Ye left the planet which housed the mysterious ruins and entered the boundless expanse of outer space. He recalled the four stellar maps he’d been given. A short while passed before he chose one and viewed it carefully before intending to find the first sprite.

Suddenly, Yang Ye turned around and looked off into the distance.

“Such sharp senses!” A voice came from there, and then a middle aged man appeared before Yang Ye. The middle aged man’s upper body was completely bare, and there was a ferocious beast tattooed on his body. It looked like an extremely fierce wolf.

The Major Zen Realm!

The middle aged man wasn’t a Sage, but he was at the Major Zen Realm at the very least. Moreover, while he wasn’t a Sage, he made Yang Ye feel a sense of pressure.

An expert!

The middle aged man walked slowly in Yang Ye’s direction, “I’m Daluo. I don’t think you’ve heard of me. After all, I’m not human. I’m from the asura race. I heard you’re worth an Originite, so I came for you. I…”

Suddenly, Yang Ye waved his hand, “Cut the crap! Let’s just fight!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye transformed into a ray of light that vanished on the spot.
