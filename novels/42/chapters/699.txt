Chapter 700 – Do You Dare?

The Fire Spirit Race worshipped fire. Of course, they didn’t just worship ordinary flames, they worshipped flames that were Natural Treasures or came from outer space.

The Fire Spirit Race had flames that were Natural Treasures too, and they had quite a few as well. However, such flames were extremely precious to them because every single flame that was a Natural Treasure could create a Half-Saint for them.

So, they were naturally shocked when they saw one now. Because it represented that the Fire Spirit Race could have another Half-Saint. One extra Half-Saint represented that the Fire Spirit Race would have one extra expert to protect their race during the upcoming battle with the defiant profounders!

When they saw the ball of flames in her hand, a wisp of greed hadn’t just flashed through the 2nd Elder’s eyes, even the Grand Elder and the 4th Elder who’d been silent until now were the same. After all, while it could create another Half-Saint, it was also sufficient to improve the strength of a Half-Saint by 20% to 30%!

On the other hand, the men and women of the Fire Spirit Race revealed even more unsightly appearances. The greedy in their eyes weren’t concealed in the slightest, and they would have probably charged forward and tried to seize it if those Half-Saints weren’t here.

“How did you get that!?” The 2nd Elder stretched out his hand and grabbed while he spoke. He was just about to grab the Nether Ghostflame when another hand grabbed the Nether Ghostflame before him.

The 2nd Elder’s expression changed, and he swiftly turned his head and glared angrily at Tong Fen who’d taken the Nether Ghostflame, “What’re you doing!?”

Tong Fen laughed coldly and said, “Qian Yan, you’re really getting more and more shameless as you age. It belongs to m y granddaughter, yet you actually intended to seize it from her. You’re really beyond shameless!”

“You....” Qian Yan was furious, and the profound energy within him surged. He seemed as if he intended to attack Tong Fen.

“Stop!” Meanwhile, the Grand Elder spoke out.

Qian Yan grunted coldly when he heard the Grand Elder, and the profound energy within him fell silent. However, his gaze was still fixed on the Nether Ghostflame which rested on Tong Fen’s palm.

The Grand Elder gazed at Xiaoman and said, “Xiaoman, where did you get it?”

Qian Yan, Tong Fen, and the 4th Elder gazed at Xiaoman because even they were extremely curious after they saw her suddenly produce a Natural Treasure.

Xiaoman gazed at Yang Ye and said, “It’s the dowry that he gave me!”

The corners of Yang Ye’s mouth twitched. Did I give it to you? You took advantage of me when I was injured, alright? But he didn’t say anything because he owed her his life. So not to mention the Nether Ghostflame, he would even give her 10 if she wanted it.

The gazes of everyone here descended onto Yang Ye.

“Him?” Qian Mei suddenly said, “How could that be possible? He’s just an ant at the Exalt Realm. How could he possibly possess a Natural Treasure? Hmph! Xiao Man, there’s no need to create such a lie just to improve your husband’s status in our Fire Spirit Race, right?”

“Xiaoman, this matter carries great implications. Tell us the truth!” The Grand Elder frowned, and his voice was slightly heavy. Because it was utterly impossible for an Exalt Realm profounder to subdue a flame which was a Natural Treasure. It was even difficult for a Monarch Realm expert. So, even he felt that Xiaoman was lying.

Xiaoman said, “It’s your choice if you want to believe me or not. In any case, it has nothing to do with all of you. Old geezer, the Fire Poison within you can be eliminated with that, right?”

Tong Fen shook his head and said, “Little Girl, I was wondering what treasure you obtained, so it was this Natural Treasure. Since it’s a Natural Treasure, then why did you reveal it in public? Don’t you know that some people are shameless to the point of completely disregarding their honor? They’ll try to take it from you if you reveal it!”

The expressions of the Grand Elder and the others became slightly unsightly while Qian Yan’s expression was unsightly to the extreme. Because even an idiot would know that Tong Fen was talking about him.

Xiaoman thought for a while, and then she gazed at Qian Yan and said, “Elder Qian, it belongs to my grandfather. You wouldn’t really be shameless to the point of trying to seize it from him, right?”

Pfft!

Yang Ye couldn’t help but start laughing when he heard her. Needless to say, her words were truly amusing.

Qian Yan’s face had instantly blushed red and darkened when he heard Xiaoman, and the rage within his heart seemed to have found a place to be vented when he heard that Yang Ye had actually started laughing. He roared furiously at Yang Ye, “You lowly human! I’ll slap you into mush!”

Yang Ye was instantly infuriated, and he said., “Are you really at the Half-Saint Realm and not the Mortal Realm? If you are a Half-Saint, then could it be that you only know how to bully the weak?”

Qian Yan’s face twitched, but he didn’t attack in the end. Because he would really be bullying the weak if he did. Moreover, Tong Fen was right beside him, so it was probably pointless as well. He immediately grunted coldly and said, “Little Bastard! Why would I need to do that to deal with you? Just my granddaughter is enough!”

Meanwhile, Qian Mei spoke coldly, “Exactly. Why would my grandfather need to act against a tiny human ant at the Exalt Realm? I’m more than enough.

Yang Ye said, “As expected, like grandfather, like granddaughter. You’re at the Monarch Realm while I’m at the Exalt Realm. Of course you’re more than enough.”

“You can’t blame anyone for your own weakness!” Qian Mei spoke coldly.

“Then what about me?” Xiaoman spoke abruptly, “Our cultivations are at around the same level. Why don’t we exchange a few blows?”

Qian Mei’s face twitched, and it was beyond unsightly. Even though her cultivation was similar to Xiaoman, her strength was much weaker. So, her intention to agree had almost left her mouth yet she forcefully swallowed her words every single time.

“Why don’t....” Meanwhile, the man who stood by Qian Mei’s side suddenly stepped forward, and then he gazed at Yang Ye and said, “Why don’t I exchange a few blows with this brother? Of course, my strength is greater, so for fairness’ sake, you only have to resist 3 swings of my sword. It’s my loss if you can accomplish that, alright?”

When he spoke up to this point, he suddenly smiled indifferently and said, “Of course, out of consideration for your cultivation, I’ll only utilize 30% of my strength, alright?”

“It’s Bai Chen!” Someone exclaimed.

“I heard of his reputation on the surface. I heard that he’s the most monstrous genius in the Sword Dao within the Hallowed Halls after Zuo Dengfeng. I never expected that he would have come to our Fire Spirit Race and even became Qian Mei’s partner. Don’t they say that sword cultivators are extremely proud? Why would he marry into our Fire Spirit Race?”

“Sword cultivators aren’t eunuchs. Any man would have needs in that aspect. So, I presume he fell for Qian Mei, and that’s why he didn’t hesitate to marry into our race!”

“No matter what the reason is. In any case, it’s a good thing for our race! Hehe, a Monarch Realm expert who’s only a little over 20, and he even possesses peak Earth Rank Sword Intent. Even if he marries into our race, the elders will definitely not ill-treat such a genius.”

“I’m really curious about Xiaoman’s partner’s reaction. I wonder if he’ll agree. If he doesn’t, then Xiaoman wouldn’t be able to hold her head up high in public anymore. Haha....”

“He definitely won’t agree!”

“Why?”

“Isn’t it obvious? Wouldn’t agreeing be equal to giving his life away?”

...

The gazes of everyone here descended onto Yang Ye. Yang Ye was just about to speak when Xiaoman suddenly took his hand and shook her head. Yang Ye’s heart felt slightly warm. Even though she’d saved him and forced him to marry her, and it was even to the extent that she’d taken the Nether Ghostflame.... However, she wasn’t a bad person at all!

Yang Ye smiled to her, and then he gazed at him and said, “What would you do if I succeed?”

“I’ll give you a 1,000 year old Firecrystal!” It wasn’t the man who spoke these words but Qian Yan, and the reason he’d spoken these words was naturally because he was afraid that Yang Ye would refuse.

“A 1,000 year old Firecrystal!” Countless people in the surroundings gasped when they heard him. Obviously, they knew how valuable it was.

Tong Fen glanced at Qian Yan. He hadn’t expected that Qian Yan would be willing to do that as he’d even intended to bet a 1,000 year old Firecrystal. Even a Half-Saint didn’t have many of those, and even he only had one last piece.

“A 1,000 year old Firecrystal?” Yang Ye gazed at Xiaoman with a questioning gaze because he didn’t know what it was.

The others couldn’t help but laugh with ridicule when they witnessed this scene, and Yang Ye had undoubtedly become an ignorant bumpkin in their eyes.

Xiaoman replied, “Firecrystals are born from within the lava. They are treasures of my Fire Spirit Race because they can improve one’s cultivation and repair one’s injuries. The older they are, the better their effects are. If you consume a 1,000 year old Firecrystal once you’ve completely recovered, then it’s very likely for you to break through into the Monarch Realm!”

“What if I consume one now? How long would it take for my injuries to recover?” asked Yang Ye.

She glanced at him and said, “3 days at most. You’ll be able to recover to your peak by then!”

“Amazing!” Yang Ye’s voice carried a trace of excitement, and then he gazed at Qian Yan and said, “Hey, old geezer. I’ll agree to the battle if you’re willing to bet 2 more Firecrystals.”

The corners of Qian Yan’s eyes twitched as he spoke with fury, “Do you think they’re rocks that can be produced at will!?”

“You don’t have them?” Yang Ye shook his head and said, “Then fine, I won’t fight him. Just do what you should be doing. Don’t bother us while we’re getting married!”

The corners of Qian Yan’s mouth twitched. He took a deep breath and spoke indifferently, “Since you want to make a big gamble, then let’s just make it huge. I have 5 of them, but what would you do if you can’t resist his attacks?”

Yang Ye shrugged and said, “Then I deserve death!”

“Dream on!” Qian Yan spoke furiously, “Your lowly life isn’t even worth a single 1,000 year old Firecrystal, yet you intend to use it to bet for 5?”

Yang Ye frowned, and then he gazed at Xiaoman. Xiaoman gazed at Tong Fen instead. Tong Fen shook his head and said, “I don’t have that many. Moreover, I don’t think that he can succeed!”

Xiaoman fell silent for a short while, and then she walked over to Yang Ye. There was a pile a thumb sized flaming rocks in her grasp, and there were around 30 of them there. She said, “Even though the best I have is only 200 years old, this is all I have.”

As she spoke, she hesitated for a moment, and then she flipped her palms. Her pair of red hammers appeared in her grasp before she passed them to Yang Ye and said, “I really don’t have anything valuable anymore!” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Yang Ye was speechless.
