Chapter 1492 - Knowledge!

Translator: InVader

The Unfettered One possessed the Sword Domain, and his attains in the Sword Dao were extraordinary. As for his strength, there was naturally no need to mention how great it was. However, Blood Maiden wasn’t weak! She similarly possessed a Domain, and her strength was beyond doubt as well. Both of them had come in here from the outside world and swept through everyone here. So, Yang Ye was very curious about who was stronger amongst them!

Lian Banzhuang gazed at Blood Maiden as well because she was similarly curious.

She’d seen the Unfettered One all those years ago. Dualism Realm experts were powerless against him.

Similarly, she’d witnessed Blood Maiden’s strength, and Dualism Realm experts weren’t a match for her as well.

So, the question was who was stronger?

Blood Maiden remained silent for a long time, and then she said, “I’ve heard about him. He’s an extraordinary genius with sword techniques that have reached the acme of perfection. Not to mention this place, even if it’s in the large world, there’s no one who can defeat him. As for me, even if I fought him in my prime, I wouldn’t have any chance to defeat him! I wouldn’t even have a 30% chance to defeat him!”

Yang Ye’s face became solemn, “Is he really that strong?”

Blood Maiden gazed at Yang Ye and said, “Very strong. Even if Eldest Sister fought him, she would only have a 50% chance to win!”

Their eldest sister! Yang Ye naturally knew that the Nether Pavilion had an eldest sister, and he was very curious about her identity. However, he didn’t ask. There were things that he could ask, and there were some that he couldn’t. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“However…” Meanwhile, Blood Maiden continued, “While he is strong, there is someone who can suppress him.”

Even the Unfettered One can be suppressed?

Yang Ye hurriedly asked, “Who is that?”

Blood Maiden remained silent for a while before she spoke once more, “That person was given birth to by the world, grew together with all things in the world, and possesses the strength of the world. However, that person is very mysterious, and only a few have heard rumors of that person. No one has actually seen that person…” She paused for a moment and continued, “Perhaps you’ll be able to meet that person in the future.”

Yang Ye smiled bitterly when she didn’t tell him everything in detail. She’s keeping things from me on purpose!

Meanwhile, Blood Maiden spoke abruptly, “You’re not weak, and your natural talent isn’t bad at all. Moreover, you possess great karmic luck and fortune. Your future accomplishments won’t be inferior to the Unfettered One. Of course, the precondition is that you don’t die.”

Yang Ye smiled and remained silent. He had no intention to make unrealistic comparisons with himself and the Unfettered One. He’d never had such intentions. The Unfettered One’s strength was the Unfettered One’s business, and all he had to do was manage his own business well. However, he did admire the Unfettered One! After all, the Unfettered One was a formidable expert, and he really wanted to meet the Unfettered One, if possible!

Because Blood Maiden’s injuries were very severe and were very old, it was rather difficult to heal. So, Yang Ye provided her Primordial Violet Energy every single day, and she would use it to repair her injuries.

Lian Banzhuang hadn’t left, and she stayed behind instead.

She naturally wouldn’t. After all, it was very likely for her to leave this damnable place if she followed Yang Ye. Yang Ye didn’t have the strength to leave, but Blood Maiden did! However, she was very well aware that it was a gamble. After all, Rebirth Realm experts might be coming to kill Blood Maiden. If she stayed here, her life may be in danger.

But she still wanted to make this gamble because it was something worthy of using her life to gamble with!

Yang Ye didn’t just sit and do nothing once he finished providing Primordial Violet Energy to Blood Maiden, and he started to cultivate Elemental Breaker and the Undying Elemental Body. He started on Elemental Breaker first. It utilized a unique method to condense the energy of the five elements into a punch, and it could disregard all defenses.

Elemental Breaker wasn’t stronger than the energy of Yin and Yang. However, it had a special characteristic, and it was its ability to pierce through its target's defenses. It was extremely useful to Yang Ye who didn’t possess the energy of Yin and Yang. For example, if he fought the Ancient Emperor Python with this technique, his punches could cause real damage to it.

Or to be precise, no matter how strong his opponent’s defenses were, those defenses would be useless before the Elemental Breaker technique!

Elemental Breaker was capable of posing a threat to Dualism Realm experts, but the precondition was that they allowed him to get close to them. Moreover, there was another precondition, and it was that the physical strength of the person executing Elemental Breaker had to be extremely strong. Elemental Breaker’s strength was reliant on the physical strength of the user!

Similarly, the Undying Elemental Body relied on its user’s physical strength to determine if it could resist the energy of Yin and Yang from Dualism Realm experts. Based on Yang Ye’s physical strength and defense, if he were able to cultivate them successfully, then the Elemental Breaker and Undying Elemental Body techniques would be able to make up for the gap in cultivation between him and Dualism Realm experts.

At that time, he could fight Dualism Realm experts even without the casket lid!

Deities?

At this moment, Deities weren’t his targets anymore!

Now, he had to think about how he would kill Dualism Realm experts!

With the Sword Domain’s help and Blood Maiden’s guidance, Yang Ye’s speed of cultivation could be described as terrifying. It only took him less than two days to fully grasp the Elemental Breaker technique!

Such speed didn’t just shock Lian Banzhuang, it even shocked Blood Maiden slightly. So, as far as they were concerned, Yang Ye was a monster.

After all, the stronger a technique was, the more difficult it would be to cultivate. Just like the Elemental Breaker technique. If an ordinary person tried to cultivate it, it would take a month or more to grasp it. But Yang Ye had merely used two days! That was truly a blow to the confidence of anyone who knew!

After he finished cultivating the Elemental Breaker technique, Yang Ye started to spar with Lian Banzhuang. He would naturally not ask Blood Maiden to spar with him. It was sparring if he asked Lian Banzhuang, but he would be asking for a beating if he asked Blood Maiden.

Yang Ye clenched his right fist, and it emanated a faint glow.

Lian Banzhuang was standing in front of him. Even though he was just a Semi-Deity, she who knew Yang Ye well didn’t underestimate him or act carelessly.

Yang Ye gazed at her and said, “Come and try my Elemental Breaker!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he stomped his right foot against the ground, and his figure shot forward like a cannonball. He was extremely swift and instantly arrived before Lian Banzhuang, and then he slammed his fist at her!

Lian Banzhuang didn’t dodge. She clenched her fist and slammed it against Yang Ye’s fist.

Her fist was naturally covered in the energy of Yin and Yang!

Boom!

As soon as their fists collided, they swiftly split up. After that, both of them took numerous steps back. Yang Ye stopped after moving 300m backwards, and Lian Banzhuang stopped after moving a little over 200m backwards.

Yang Ye glanced at his fist, and a wisp of excitement flashed through his eyes. Even though he was at a disadvantage, Lian Banzhuang was a Dualism Realm expert! He hadn’t used any treasures, and he’d merely relied on his fist to fight a Dualism Realm expert! If he used the casket lid as well, he wouldn’t have to fear Dualism Realm experts at all.

Of course, it was only limited to ordinary Dualism Realm experts. Blood Maiden was in the Dualism Realm as well, but the gap between her strength and Lian Banzhuang’s strength was absolutely huge!

Meanwhile, Lian Banzhuang said, “That technique combined with your physical strength is sufficient to go against the energy of Yin and Yang. Congratulations. From now on, you can fight Dualism Realm experts without using any treasures.”

Yang Ye smiled. He was about to speak when Blood Maiden, who sat cross-legged on the ground, suddenly opened her eyes, “How can you think like that? His strength is sufficient to fight Dualism Realm experts, but it doesn’t represent that he can kill Dualism Realm experts. Not to mention anyone else, do you think he can kill you?”

Lian Banzhuang glanced at Yang Ye and shook her head. Even though Yang Ye had become much stronger and could resist her energy of Yin and Yang, it was clearly not very likely that he could kill her.

Blood Maiden gazed at Yang Ye, “Remember that you must not be careless in a battle with a Dualism Realm expert. Banzhuang is just an ordinary Dualism Realm expert, but if you encounter those special Dualism Realm experts like those who have grasped some sort of law or formidable intent, you’ll realize that there’s quite a large gap between you and them!”

Yang Ye nodded, “I understand, I won’t get overconfident!”

Blood Maiden nodded lightly, “Remember that you must never be overconfident. Many people think they’re extraordinary upon gaining some accomplishments. Actually, people who have such thoughts are mostly weaklings. The truly strong know how vast the world is, and they know themselves well. That’s exactly why they never feel overconfident. You have natural talent and the right mentality, but mentality can change. Some grow stronger and strong, but some grow weaker and weaker. So, you must constantly examine yourself and your heart.”

As soon as she finished speaking, she gazed at Lian Banzhuang, “You too!”

Lian Banzhuang quickly nodded, “Thank you for the reminder!”

Yang Ye nodded, “Thank you for the guidance!” Just as Blood Maiden had said, it really was easy to get overconfident. Moreover, once one became overconfident, one would become blind and unable to discern one’s strength properly. That was extremely terrifying!

Blind Maiden nodded slightly, and then she closed her eyes.

After that, Yang Ye started cultivating the Undying Elemental Body technique. Just like the Elemental Breaker technique, it required the energy of the five elements, and it used the energy of the five elements to strengthen the body. Presently, Yang Ye’s body was at the Undying Realm, so his body would definitely grow a level higher if he cultivated the Undying Elemental Body technique!

The Undying Elemental Body technique had certain requirements towards its user’s body, but it wasn’t a problem for him.

In the blink of an eye, seven days had passed. Besides providing Primordial Violet Energy to Blood Maiden, Yang Ye just cultivated the Elemental Breaker, Undying Elemental Body, and Rebirth Sword techniques throughout these seven days. Even though he’d succeeded at grasping the Elemental Breaker and Rebirth Sword, he still had to train diligently.

Every single time he cultivated them again, he would comprehend new things about the techniques!

Just like that, two more days passed.

Blood Maiden sat cross-legged on the ground, and she frequently emanated a faint bloody glow. Yang Ye knew that it was a sign that she was on the verge of being unable to suppress her cultivation any longer.

If it were at any other ordinary time, that would definitely be good news. She would just naturally advance into the Rebirth Realm. After all, she was once at the Rebirth Realm, so it wasn’t really a breakthrough but recovering to the Rebirth Realm.

However, it still required a process, and that process was the period she was in most danger.

Noon.

Blood Maiden suddenly opened her eyes and said, “They’re here.”
