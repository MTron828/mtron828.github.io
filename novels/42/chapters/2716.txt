Chapter 2717 – Sly Cultivator!

Suddenly, Heng Wangu slammed another punch forward!

His countenance instantly turned ghastly pale when he did this!

Obviously, he’d used some sort of secret technique!

However, this punch was much more terrifying than any other punch from before!

Yang Ye’s expression changed when he sensed the terrifying force contained within Heng Wangu’s punch, but he couldn’t dodge it at all.

The punch covered the space in an area of 300m around him!

He had no choice but to go head-on against it!

Yang Ye took his sword in both hands while his profound energy surged madly into the sword. At the same time, he activated the Sword Domain and Slaughter Domain!

Both Domains overlapped!

Yang Ye shouted with fury as he swung the sword.

Bang!

Yang Ye and Heng Wangu were blasted away.

As he flew backward, Yang Ye’s body started to crack open inch by inch and blood sprayed incessantly from him. Meanwhile, Heng Wangu’s body was splitting open inch by inch as well. However, unlike Yang Ye, his body was being sliced open by sword energy!

It didn’t take long for them to stop their figures.

As soon as he stopped himself, Yang Ye looked up at Heng Wangu. His physical injuries were healing at a visible rate, but Heng Wangu didn’t have that ability!

Heng Wangu cracked a smile, “I’ve lost! I’ve lost in recovery!”

Yang Ye didn’t waste his breath and just charged at Heng Wangu.

Admitting defeat?

If that worked, he would have done that. Unfortunately, the fight between him and the End World would only end when one party died.

The End World would never let him go unless they were annihilated. Similarly, he would never spare them while he was alive!

Heng Wangu closed his eyes slowly when he saw Yang Ye charge at him, and then he clenched his right fist again. This time, his face was pale like a corpse, and his veins even bulged up.

His secret technique was at its limits!

If he couldn’t stop this attack, he would die, and even if he did stop it, he would still die.

It was a hopeless situation!

While it was hopeless, Heng Wangu still remained composed.

He’d disregarded life and death a long time ago!

Right when Heng Wangu was about to launch the attack, something unexpected occurred. The space before him suddenly twisted into a strange vortex, and then a pitch black hand emerged from there before slamming down at Yang Ye.

At this moment, Yang Ye’s sword had just descended, but it only descended halfway before Yang Ye noticed to his astonishment that a wave of powerful energy had stopped his sword.

Yang Ye’s expression changed drastically and he knew that the situation was bad. He wanted to retreat, but the pitch black hand suddenly tapped at it. This tap struck the tip of his sword.

Bang!

Yang Ye was blasted over 10km away.

The black hand didn’t attack again and just returned to the spatial rift. However, a voice resounded in Heng Wangu’s mind, “Retreat.”

As soon as the voice finished speaking, a 300m long rift appeared by Heng Wangu’s side!

Heng Wangu didn’t hesitate to glance at the others, “Retreat.”

Meanwhile, Zuo Mu returned to Heng Wangu’s side, and there was a bloody hole in his chest.

At the same time, An Nanjing returned to Yang Ye’s side, and there was a very long cut on her face. It could be said that it had practically destroyed her face!

However, An Nanjing didn’t become ugly from that. Conversely, it gave her a unique bearing.

The others on Yang Ye’s side stopped as well because Yang Ye was in bad shape.

Yang Ye’s entire arm was mangled like it had been blasted with a bomb, and even the bones within were visible. Besides that, his entire body was like a porcelain jar that had fallen to the ground. While his body hadn’t shattered, he was on the verge of it.

That last attack had been absolutely powerful!

Fortunately, he had Snowy’s spirit energy and Primordial Violet Energy. Otherwise, he would probably die from such injuries.

The experts from the End World entered the spatial rift in succession. Once all of them had entered, Heng Wangu finally entered it as well. But he suddenly turned to look at Yang Ye right before he went through, “You’re formidable indeed!”

He entered the spatial rift.

A short while later, the rift vanished and everything here returned to normal!

It was like the rift had never been there!

Yan Wu and the Past Life Clan’s patriarch went over to Yang Ye, and they heaved sighs of relief when they noticed that he was still alive.

They’d wagered everything on Yang Ye, so if he died, all their hard work would be for nothing!

Meanwhile, Jian Wudi and Qing Xuan went over to Yang Ye. Jian Wudi frowned when he saw the horrifying state Yang Ye was in, but just a short while later, everyone including Jian Wudi was stunned.

Because Yang Ye was recovering rapidly!

His injuries were healing extremely rapidly at a rate that seemed unusual to everyone here.

Just like that, it didn’t even take an hour for Yang Ye to be almost fully healed.

Yang Ye stood up. He was healed now, so he glanced at the people here, “Thank you!”

If they hadn’t assisted him, just he and An Nanjing alone would have never been able to defeat the End World.Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

The facts proved that fighting as a group was much better.

Yan Wu smiled, “You’ve helped us tremendously too, so don’t mention it. Just let us know if you need help again!”

He paused for a moment and continued, “Do you know who attacked you at the end?”

That last attack!

Everyone here had solemn expressions on their faces.

Yang Ye had almost been crushed by that hand!

Yang Ye’s face gradually became solemn as well.

Because it felt too terrifying even to him!

After his strength improved tremendously, he’d only felt like that when facing Tu, and the owner of that hand had clearly not used their full strength!

It could be said that if that expert showed themself, his side would definitely be incapable of stopping that expert!

But that expert hadn’t done anything. Obviously, that expert was worried about something!

Yang Ye looked up at the sky. What was that fellow afraid of? Obviously, it was Destiny!

Yan Wu said, “Brother Yang, I’m afraid this matter requires some planning!”

The Past Life Clan’s patriarch nodded as well, “Indeed. It’s best if we don’t act rashly until we figure out the strength and identity of that mysterious expert who’s supporting the End World.”

Based on the situation just now, that mysterious expert’s strength was clearly above all of them.

Yang Ye smiled, “I know.”

As he spoke, he glanced at them, “Everyone, all of you should head home for now. Remember to try your best to stay in touch, and it’s best if you establish teleportation formations to help each other when necessary. Of course, feel free to contact me too.”

The Past Life Clan’s patriarch and Yan Wu exchanged glances, and they nodded.

Ya Wu said, “Brother Yang, we’ll be leaving now. Take care.”

Both of them and the members of their clans vanished into the sky.

Yang Ye gazed at the Yang Clan’s Grand Elder who was still standing there, “Grand Elder, do you have something to say?”

The Grand Elder nodded but was quite hesitant.

Yang Ye asked, “What is it?”

The Grand Elder sighed softly, “Our ancestor protected the clan with her life and helped our clan become acknowledged by the universe. However, our Yang Clan suffered a terrible decline later on. Especially after she vanished, the clan has been in decline with each passing year…”

He glanced at Yang Ye and said, “We’ve told the clan that you’re a member of the Yang Clan, and we want you to become our clan’s representative to rekindle the confidence of our clan’s young generation… No, it’s the confidence of our entire clan.”

Yang Ye fell silent.

The Grand Elder said, “If you don’t want to, we…”

Yang Ye smiled, “It’s fine, so long as you’re not afraid that I’ll drag down the Yang Clan!”

The Grand Elder was visibly relieved, and he smiled, “No matter what kind of trouble you’re in, the Yang Clan is willing to face it with you. I’m absolutely sincere when I say that!”

Yang Ye’s bloodline wasn’t the pure bloodline of the Yang Clan, but so what?

So long as someone was a genius, all of that didn’t matter. Moreover, strictly speaking, Yang Ye was a descendant of the Yang Clan. While his bloodline was diluted, all that matters was that he did possess the Yang Clan’s bloodline. Even if it was an absolutely diluted version.

Because it represented that he was part of their clan!

Strength!

Strength was always the most important at any time.

If one lacked strength, even what isn’t a problem may become a problem, but there would be no problems with sufficient strength!

A short while later, the Grand Elder left with the other members of the Yang Clan.

Only Cang Mu, Sha Ji, Jian Wudi, and Qing Xuan remained here.

Jian Wudi glanced at the place where the experts of the End World had entered the spatial rift and said, “They aren’t weak. Moreover, while they fled in defeat, their overall strength is intact. You must be careful.”

Yang Ye nodded, “I’ll get someone to investigate.”

Jiang Wudi patted Yang Ye on the shoulder, “Your strength is pretty good, but your Sword Dao is an extreme type… Sigh, just be careful. Don’t let the sword control you. And kid, you’re more like a Sly Cultivator than a Sword Cultivator. You have so many tricks up your sleeves!”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

Jian Wudi chuckled and vanished into the sky with Qing Xuan.

Yang Ye shook his head, smiled, and gazed at Cang Mu and Sha Ji. Cang Mu said, “How’s our Master?”

Yang Ye spoke softly, “Don’t worry. I’ll find her.”

He naturally hadn’t forgotten about Qi Bitian and Tian Xiu. It was the thing he was most worried about right now as well. After all, the strongest form of Destiny was much more terrifying than the End World!

They nodded and soundlessly vanished.

Once they left, Yang Ye turned around, and a woman walked over in his direction!

Tu!

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly, tightened his grip on his sword, and prepared to attack at any moment!
