Chapter 1353 – Feasting On A Dragon!

Blind Maiden, Jian Xu, and the black dragon were vigilant, but Yang Ye was overjoyed.

Why?

Because he knew the owner of the laughter. It was Qiong Qi who’d been sleeping for very, very long!

“I never expected to smell an evil aura upon waking up. Hahaha!” As soon as these words finished resounding, a black shadow flashed out from Yang Ye’s chest, and it didn’t take long for Qiong Qi to appear before everyone.

The expression on Blind Maiden’s face eased up because Qiong Qi had emerged from within Yang Ye. In other words, Qiong Qi was with Yang Ye. As for Jian Xu and the black dragon, their faces were quite unsightly. Especially the black dragon, its enormous eyes were filled with seriousness and a trace of fear.

It was a dragon, and it was at the top of the food chain within the demon race. Very few demon beasts could pose a threat to it, but this demon beast that it had never seen before felt extremely dangerous to it.

What demon beast is that?

The black dragon wasn’t the only one who was filled with bewilderment. Jian Xu was the same.

It was very understandable that Jian Xu and the black dragon didn’t recognize Qiong Qi. After all, they weren’t from the Radiant Dimension, and the group of defiant cultivators and ferocious beasts from all those years ago hadn’t gone to Dark Hell Continent. So, both the black dragon and Jian Xu’s hearts were filled with bewilderment when they saw Qiong Qi’s slightly strange appearance. Of course, they felt even more fear!

After Qiong Qi appeared here, his gaze had immediately locked onto the demonic dragon in the sky, and there was a trace of greed in his eyes.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly said, “You’re finally awake!”

Qiong Qi turned to look at Yang Ye, and he said angrily, “Isn’t that all your fault? Actually, are you trying to give me trouble on purpose? Otherwise, why are you always in a hopeless situation when I wake up?”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

Qiong Qi continued, “Forget it. In any case, I’ll only be staying with you for a few years. I refuse to believe that you can get me killed during that time.” As soon as he finished speaking, he looked at the demonic dragon in the sky, “The Dragon Clan.... Unfortunately, his bloodline isn’t pure. Otherwise, I would have to fear him slightly.”

“My bloodline isn’t pure?” The black dragon laughed coldly, “Are you joking? I’m from the legitimate Dragon Clan of Dark Hell Continent, and the blood which flows within me is the purest bloodline of the Dragon Clan....”

“The purest bloodline of the Dragon Clan?” Qiong Qi interrupted the black dragon, “How laughable! You actually say that you possess the purest bloodlines. Do you know what a true dragon is like? Do you know how terrifying a true dragon is? No, you don’t! Right, allow me to correct myself. You’re not the only one with an impure bloodline, your ancestor is the same! This world.... No, this universe doesn’t have a true dragon. The dragons here can only be considered as part of the branch clans of the true Dragon Clan. The laughable thing is that you actually think that you’re a true dragon!”

“What nonsense!” The black dragon spoke with fury, “Lowly being that came out of nowhere! You actually dare to disrespect my Dragon Clan....”

“Lowly?” Viciousness flashed through Qiong Qi’s eyes. A moment later, he transformed into a ray of red light that shot up into the air towards the black dragon.

“Hmph!” The black dragon grunted while viciousness flashed through his eyes as well, and then he slammed his body towards Qiong Qi.

Yang Ye and the others watched as the black dragon and Qiong Qi collided.

Bang!

Yang Ye and the others watched with astonishment as the black dragon which was countless times larger than Qiong Qi was actually knocked away. Moreover, countless fine cracks had actually appeared on the barrier of light around the black dragon.

Meanwhile, Qiong Qi didn’t stop, and his figure flashed and shot towards the black dragon again!

Bang! Bang! Bang!

Numerous explosions resounded from above the sky. The black dragon wasn’t just pushed back repeatedly by the violent attacks from Qiong Qi, over 100 injuries which were over 100m long had appeared on his body. They were naturally created by Qiong Qi’s claws. The demonic dragon’s defenses had risen countless times higher after executing the Shield of Darkness, but Qiong Qi’s claws were even sharper!

Yang Ye heaved a sigh of relief when he witnessed this scene. He’d been quite worried. After all, Qiong Qi hadn’t been so strong before he fell into a deep slumber. Now it would seem like his worries were unnecessary. Qiong Qi’s strength had definitely been recovering slowly during his deep sleep. Even though he didn’t know how much Qiong Qi had recovered, he had no doubt that Qiong Qi wasn’t the same Qiong Qi from before who could only kill Emperors!

Jian Xu’s face was gloomy when he saw the black dragon being pushed back repeatedly. He’d planned for every contingency, but he hadn’t expected Yang Ye to have such a terrifying existence like Qiong Qi with him.

Flee?

Such a thought appeared in Jian Xu’s mind, but he rejected it in an instant. Blind Maiden was here, so it would be utterly impossible for him to flee, nor did he want to flee!

Because he’d been fleeing for thousands of years!

Jian Xu took a deep breath, and the profound energy within him surged madly. After that, the space around him started to tremble violently. Yang Ye’s expression changed at the sight of this. Since Jian Xu hadn’t fled, it was obvious that Jian Xu intended to make his final stand. But Yang Ye wasn’t able to execute Heavenrend now, so he was utterly incapable of being a threat to Jian Xu!

Moreover, he’d started to suffer backlash from his sword intent!

Suddenly, Blind Maiden appeared in front of Yang Ye, and then she tapped her finger against the center of Yang Ye’s forehead. Yang Ye instantly felt a strand of mysterious energy enter his mind. As soon as it did, his mind immediately cleared up significantly, and the backlash seemed to have weakened slightly!

Blind Maiden withdrew her hand and said, “Go meditate. Don’t let the backlash progress further. Leave the rest to me!” Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Yang Ye nodded, and then his figure flashed and appeared 30km away. He’d used his ultimate moves, but he still hadn’t been able to kill Jian Xu. So, if he were to stay here, then he would only be a burden for Qiong Qi and Blind Maiden,

Yang Ye paid no attention to the battle. He just sat down cross-legged, withdrew violet crystals, and started to absorb them. As the energy surged into him, the tiny vortex immediately started to spin, and then threads of violet energy flowed out from the tiny vortex before spreading throughout his body and repaired the injuries that Jian Xu had inflicted on him.

Jian XU stared fixedly at Blind Maiden. Besides seriousness, there was a trace of ferocity in them as well. If it wasn’t for Blind Maiden, he would have obtained the Stellar Sword Diagram and left this world a long time ago. However, it was exactly because of Blind Maiden that he hadn’t just been unable to obtain the Stellar Sword Diagram, he’d almost lost his life as well. Even though he’d survived in the end, he didn’t dare to reveal his true identity to others and had no choice but to hide.

It was all because of the woman before him!

Jian Xu closed his eyes slowly while the Quasi Returnal Rank sword intent around him grew denser and denser in volume, and it grew sharper and sharper as well. Even the space around him was trembling more and more rapidly. A moment of silence later, Jian Xu suddenly opened his eyes, and then he pressed his index and middle fingers together before pointing them at Blind Maiden from afar.

Om!

An ear piercing sword howl resounded through the sky, and then the space around Jian Xu collapsed. Countless pitch black energy swords flashed out from the huge black hole, and they shot off in Blind Maiden’s direction.

Blind Maiden’s expression remained calm and composed as she stretched her hand forward. In an instant, countless rays of light shot out from her like a meteor shower, and they slammed against the energy swords before her.

Bang! Bang! Bang!

Explosions resounded incessantly within the black hole.

Yang Ye couldn’t help but open his eyes and shoot a glance towards the battlefield. At this moment, Blind Maiden and Jian Xu were within a black hole, and energy swords and rays of light were flashing and colliding incessantly there. The entire black hole had warped, and it seemed to be unable to endure their strength!

They were true experts!

Yang Ye was very well aware that while he seemed to have fought Jian Xu earlier, he’d merely been relying on his equipment. Moreover, Jian Xu had wanted to delay. Otherwise, he might have been beaten down a long time ago. There was a huge gap between him and Jian Xu right now!

A person could be confident, but couldn’t be conceited, and it was very important to understand one’s limitations and avoid becoming lost within the power gained from external sources!

Roar!

Suddenly, a shrill cry resounded from high above.

Yang Ye was shocked and hurriedly looked up, and he was stunned by the scene before his eyes. At this moment, Qiong Qi was actually eating the black dragon’s tail!

Qiong Qi had grabbed the black dragon’s enormous tail with his claws, and he was swiftly biting and eating the dragon. No matter how the black dragon shook his body, it didn’t make a difference!

The speed Qiong Qi devoured the black dragon was quite shocking, or it should be described as abnormal. In just a few breaths of time, he’d consumed around 10% of the black dragon’s tail!

Moreover, the speed he ate was growing faster and faster....

As for the black dragon, his enormous eyes were filled with terror. Moreover, he seemed to shake his body and shrink it incessantly with the goal of escaping Qiong Qi. It didn’t take long for his figure to shrink down to a size of 300m, and then he immediately shot towards the ocean below.

Suddenly, Blind Maiden’s voice resounded, “Don’t let him get into the ocean!”

There was no need for Blind Maiden to warn him. Qiong Qi had already transformed into a ray of light that shot towards the black dragon. The black dragon’s speed was clearly inferior to Qiong Qi, so Qiong Qi caught up in an instant.

Yang Ye watched with astonishment as Qiong Qi grabbed the black dragon’s tail and dragged the black dragon back to where they came from, and then started eating again.

Roar!

The black dragon’s shrill and miserable howls resounded incessantly, and it was filled with terror and despair!

Qiong Qi paid no attention to the black dragon and ceaselessly tore the black dragon apart. The black dragon was gradually dissected into pieces. The most terrifying part about this was that the black dragon was still alive. But the black dragon could only watch as his body was being torn into countless pieces and eaten.

Around a few dozen breaths of time later, that area in the sky had returned to normal.

The black dragon was nowhere to be found, and only Qiong Qi’s ceaselessly burping figure remained there.

Yang Ye was stunned for a long time, and then he hurriedly pointed at Jian Xu and said, “Brother Qiong Qi, kill him!”

Qiong Qi glanced at Yang Ye before he turned to look at Jian Xu, and then his figure shot towards Jian Xu.

Jian Xu’s countenance instantly turned ghastly pale when he saw Qiong Qi shoot towards him, and a wisp of despair arose in his eyes.

Blind Maiden didn’t stand by idly. Her figure flashed and transformed into a ray of light that surged towards Jian Xu.

Could Jian Xu resist Qiong Qi and Blind Maiden’s joint forces?

Of course he couldn’t!

However, right when Jian Xu was about to lose his life, a beam of light had suddenly shot up into the sky, and then a white figure appeared before Jian Xu.

Bang!

A terrifying aura surged out from the white figure, and then both Blind Maiden and Qiong Qi were instantly blasted 3km away.

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.
