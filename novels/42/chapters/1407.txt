Chapter 1408 – You’re So Full Of Crap!

The sky seemed like it was drenched with blood, and it was completely dark red while the smell of blood and boundless slaughter intent rained down like a storm.

Everyone was shocked!

The Celestial Demon Lord frowned, but he didn’t stop and even sped up. He knew that someone had definitely come to help, and it was not to help him, of course. However, he didn’t care because the battle would be over once Zhuang Weiran was killed.

The Celestial Demon Wolf received his command and sped up its charge towards Zhuang Weiran.

Right when both of them were around 30m away from Zhuang Weiran, a figure had appeared before her, and it was a completely blood red figure.

It was Yang Ye, of course!

A wisp of ferocity flashed through Yang Ye’s blood red eyes as he gazed at the Demon Lord and Celestial Demon Wolf in front of him, and then he grabbed Sword Precursor’s hilt and swung it!

The true form of Heavenrend!

The Demon Lord’s pupils had constricted when Yang Ye drew his sword, and a wisp of shock had flashed through his eyes. Obviously, this attack had surpassed his expectations. He didn’t dare act carelessly. He stretched out his right hand, and a black ball of energy suddenly appeared in front of him. After that, the ball of energy suddenly emanated a ray of dazzling black light that slammed against Yang Ye’s sword energy.

Bang!

A huge explosion resounded like a thunderclap, and it caused sharp pain to shoot through the eardrums of many. At the moment the sword energy and black ball of energy shattered, countless strands of black energy and sword energy shot madly towards the surroundings, and they even sliced apart the space before them!

In just an instant, the entire sky was covered in a dense expanse of spatial rifts.

It didn’t take long for the surroundings to return to normal.

At this moment, the Demon Lord and the Celestial Demon Wolf were over 3km away. The Demon Lord shot a glance at his right hand, and he saw a bone-deep injury there, causing his face to instantly turn gloomy. When he looked up and gazed at Yang Ye, there was a trace of seriousness in his eyes. As for the wolf by his side, it had a ferocious glow in its eyes and seemed ready to swallow Yang Ye up.

The battle in the sky had stopped, the battle below was still going on.

Once Elder Yuan’s group of three joined the battle, the army of Clouds of Heaven Stellar Region gradually stopped being pushed back and turned the situation around slightly. Most importantly, hope blazed once more in their hearts when they suddenly received reinforcements.

At this moment, all of them were fighting more desperately than they ever had!

No one wanted to die!

In the sky.

“You’re Yang Ye!” The Demon Lord stared fixedly at Yang Ye as he spoke. He naturally knew of Yang Ye because Yang Ye was the reason that Skyriver Stellar Region had retreated. However, he would have made them leave even if Yang Ye hadn’t forced them to leave. He didn’t want to share too much of the benefits from this conquest, and that was also one of the reasons why he hadn’t launched a full scale attack while the forces of Skyriver Stellar Region were still by his side!

Yang Ye glanced at the Demon Lord, and there was a solemn expression in his eyes.

Very strong!

The Demon Lord was even stronger than Jian Xu!

After all, he’d executed the true form of Heavenrend. However, the Demon Lord had forcefully withstood it and merely suffered light injuries. Even Jian Xu had lost an arm to his Heavenrend. But the Demon Lord had merely suffered a light injury!

Yang Ye withdrew his gaze and turned around to look at Zhuang Weiran. She was still the same, but she wasn’t composed and indifferent as she had been. Not only was her countenance pale right now, it was covered in extreme exhaustion. It was obvious how it had been for her throughout this time.

She had to face a formidable enemy on the outside while the people by her side tried to force her to get married. Moreover, it was even her loved ones who were doing that.

Only someone who’d experienced it for themselves could understand how it felt.

She was looking at him while he looked at her. Yang Ye seemed much more mature than he had been, and the only thing that remained the same was his gaze. It was still filled with confidence.

Suddenly, Yang Ye stretched out his arm and wrapped it around her soft waist, and then he pecked her slightly pale lips.

Zhuang Weiran’s delicate figure stiffened.

Yang Ye didn’t kiss her for long and their lips parted just a moment later. He grinned and said, “You always protected me in the past. Now, I can finally protect you for once.”

If it wasn’t for her, he would have died many times by now. Especially during that last battle on the Radiant Dimension, it had truly been a hopeless situation, and he might have really died if it wasn’t for her.

As a man, it sounded really bad to always be protected by a woman! Now, Yang Ye felt quite proud that he could protect her for once.

She gazed at him for a while before she said, “I knew that you would come. If you don’t, then you are dead.”

Yang Ye grinned, “This isn’t the time for that.” As he spoke, he turned to look at the Demon Lord and said, “Do you want the man or wolf?”

She replied, “You choose!”

Yang Ye nodded and didn’t refuse. He immediately gazed at the Demon Lord and said, “Demon Lord, I really admire you. Even Celestial Demon City is gone, yet you’re still so calm and composed. You’re even more ruthless than I am!”

The Celestial Demon Lord’s eyes narrowed slightly, “Celestial Demon City is gone?”

Yang Ye was stunned, “What? You don’t know?”

The Demon Lord frowned. Actually, he couldn’t be blamed for that. When Yang Ye’s group arrived at Celestial Demon Continent, Yang Ye had killed one of the Deities there right away, and then they’d joined forces and practically instantly annihilated the other Deity there. It wasn’t just that Deity who’d been instantly annihilated, practically all the other Semi-Deities had been annihilated in an instant as well! Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

After all, Yang Ye and Elder Yuan’s group was comparable to 4 Deities!

So, no one had been able to send the news to the Demon Lord before they died. As for the others, they were too weak and weren’t qualified to send transmissions to the Demon Lord. So, they couldn’t notify him even if they wanted to.

The Celestial Demon Lord waved his right hand, and then a transmission talisman shot forward and exploded in midair. However, he received no reply after a breath of time passed.

The Demon Lord’s eyes narrowed slightly. It didn’t take long for him to slowly close his eyes, and then a strand of his divine sense pierced through space and shot towards Celestial Demon Continent.

Yang Ye didn’t stop him because Yang Ye had transformed into a ray of blood red light that charged into the army from Celestial Demon Stellar Region.

Once he charged into the army, a wave of terrifying slaughter intent instantly swept towards the surroundings and enveloped everyone from Celestial Demon Stellar Region. Besides Deities and Semi-Deities, everyone else was corrupted by the slaughter intent and became machines of slaughter. They attacked anyone they saw!

As for the Semi-Deities, they were severely affected by the slaughter intent, causing their strengths to suffer a sharp decline.

The situation had been instantly turned around once Yang Ye joined the battle.

Right when Yang Ye was about to slaughter his way through the army, the Demon Lord suddenly opened his eyes. At this moment, ferocity filled his eyes while strands of terrifying aura surged out incessantly from him and cracked apart the space in its path.

Obviously, he’d found out about the state of Celestial Demon Continent!

“Yang Ye!” His gaze descended onto Yang Ye, and his face was covered in madness and ferocity, “Yang Ye! You actually slaughter everyone in my city! Good! Very good! Don’t worry, I won’t kill you later! I’ll make you watch as everyone you know dies miserably before you! I won’t spare anyone who’s related to you!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he stretched his right hand forward, and then a huge black palm pierced through space and clawed at Yang Ye.

Zhuang Weiran frowned slightly. She was about to help when Yang Ye instantly transformed into a ray of blood red light that shot at the Demon Lord.

Zhuang Weiran glanced at Yang Ye, and then she transformed into a ray of white light that charged at the Celestial Demon Wolf.

Bang!

When Yang Ye collided with the Demon Lord’s attack, a deafening explosion resounded through the sky, and the space there collapsed in an instant. However, Yang Ye and the Demon Lord didn’t stop, and they started to fight within the expanse of collapsed space.

Rumble!

Explosions resounded incessantly through the sky.

The space around them was collapsing incessantly and being destroyed without end, and then it was being constantly repaired. However, it would collapse right after it was repaired.

They were too strong!

Meanwhile, because of the effects of Yang Ye’s slaughter intent, the situation in the battle on the ground below had become one-sided. Because practically 90% of the experts from Celestial Demon Stellar Region had been corrupted by Yang Ye’s slaughter intent, so they attacked anyone they saw, even if those people were their own comrades. Thus, most of the experts from Celestial Demon Stellar Region had started to fight and kill each other!

As for the Semi-Deities and Deities, while they hadn’t been completely corrupted, they were still affected. Their minds weren’t able to stay clear, and their strengths suffered a sharp decline.

Under such circumstances, Celestial Demon Stellar Region was naturally no match for Clouds of Heaven Stellar Region.

However, it was the battles in the air that really decided the outcome of the war.

If Yang Ye and Zhuang Weiran couldn’t defeat the Celestial Demon Lord and the Celestial Demon Wolf, then the outcome wouldn’t change even if all the Deities and Semi-Deities on the ground below were killed.

It was the same for Celestial Demon Stellar Region as well!

Bang!

Suddenly, an explosion resounded in the sky, and then Yang Ye was blasted 3km away.

The Demon Lord stared fixedly at Yang Ye, “Yang Ye, I’ll make you live out your life in pain. I’ll make everyone you care about suffer every single form of torture in this world while you watch! I....”

“You’re so full of crap!” Yang Ye interrupted the Demon Lord, stomped his right foot down, and transformed into a ray of light that shot explosively in the Demon Lord’s direction.
