Chapter 1370 – You’re Full Of Crap!

Bang!

As soon as his finger was pointed upwards, an explosion resounded as the Eye of the Heaven Dao exploded into bits in the sky.

Everyone here froze on the spot.

It’s gone? Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

What happened to the Eye of the Heaven Dao?

Mo Xie’s eyes were opened wide as he looked up at the sky. Even his eyeballs had almost popped out from their sockets. Mo Xie wasn’t the only one. Besides Nether Maiden, everyone else here was visibly stunned.

Why?

Because besides Nether Maiden, no one had seen Yang Ye’s attack clearly. All of them were just Quasi Emperors, so their cultivations were too low.

3 breaths of time later, Mo Xie suddenly turned to look at Yang Ye, “Did you do that?!”

The gazes of everyone instantly descended onto Yang Ye when they heard him. At this moment, they recalled that Yang Ye seemed to have pointed up at the sky.

Yang Ye didn’t answer Mo Xie and just gazed at Nether Maiden with a smile on his face, “Are you surprised?”

Nether Maiden nodded slightly and said, “I’m quite surprised indeed. Your strength isn’t just a little stronger than before.”

Yang Ye smiled. While both of them were friends, they were competing against each other as well. Both of them had come from Profounder Continent and fought a few times, yet it had always ended with a tie. However, he felt that his current strength was definitely capable of defeating Nether Maiden. So, he couldn’t help but be a little complacent.

Suddenly, Nether Maiden appeared in front of him and tapped her finger in his direction.

A slight smile curled up on the corners of Yang Ye’s mouth when he witnessed this scene. Looks like she doesn’t want to admit defeat.

However, it didn’t take long for the smile on the corners of his mouth to stiffen. Because the vitality within his body had actually started to flow away swiftly. In just a moment, he’d lost at least 100 years of his lifespan. Moreover, threads of Death Energy had appeared on him.

But in just an instant, a strand of energy surged out abruptly from within him, and then the threads of Death Energy instantly vanished. Moreover, he felt like his body was filled with vitality while the lifespan he’d just lost had returned once more.

What was that? Yang Ye was astounded.

“Reversal of life and death!” Nether Maiden spoke flatly, “I just grasped it.”

“It’s very formidable!” said Yang Ye. He wasn’t being polite. Her ability really was very formidable, or it should be called very terrifying. Lifespan was extremely important to many people. Especially those experts who hadn’t been able to attain a breakthrough for a very long time. Even a day of lifespan was extremely precious to them.

If someone without much lifespan encountered Nether Maiden, there would be no need to fight. Because she could kill that person in a moment.

Meanwhile, Nether Maiden said, “Since you’re here, then I’ll leave everything to you.” She fell silent for a while, and then she added, “Quickly take them with you and leave the Radiant Dimension once you’re done.”

It was a voice transmission!

That last bit had been sent to him via voice transmission!

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Why?”

Nether Maiden looked him in the eyes, “Would I harm you?”

Yang Ye shook his head.

“Then do as I’ve said. I hope we’ll meet again.” As soon as she finished speaking, she turned around and vanished on the spot.

Yang Ye frowned. His intuition told him that something might be about to happen.

Bang!

Suddenly, a loud explosion resounded in the sky, and then 3 terrifying auras appeared there. The entire world seemed to tremble before them!

Emperors!

The auras of Emperors!

Xiao Bieli and the other experts of White Deer Dimension turned ghastly pale at the sight of this. Not to mention 3 Emperors, they couldn’t even fight one Emperor. Yet now, 3 Emperors had actually been sent here!

Meanwhile, Mo Xie couldn’t help but laugh, “Yang Ye, you really had to try and walk through hell’s gates. You....”

Om!

A sword howl resounded. A ray of sword energy flashed, and it was so swift that no one could see it clearly.

Hiss!

They hadn’t even been able to react before Mo Xie’s head flew up into the air, and it was accompanied by a pillar of blood. It was an extremely bloody sight.

Yang Ye glanced at the flying head and spoke indifferently, “You were too full of crap.”

The other experts here stiffened on the spot. It didn’t take long for them to recover from their shock, and then undisguised horror appeared in their eyes.

After all, Yang Ye had killed a Quasi Emperor like he was slaughtering a chicken!

As for Xiao Bieli and the others, they were stunned on the spot. Obviously, they hadn’t expected Yang Ye’s strength to actually be at such a terrifying level. After all, a Quasi Emperor had been killed with such ease.

Wasn’t it a little too terrifying?

Meanwhile, 3 Emperors appeared in the sky above White Deer Dimension. Their gazes descended onto Yang Ye, and the black robed middle aged man who led the group spoke coldly, “You destroyed the Eye of the Heaven Dao?”

Yang Ye nodded.

The black robed middle aged man’s face instantly turned gloomy, “How dare you! You....”

His voice stopped abruptly. A moment of silence ensued, and then a blood red mark appeared on his throat. An instant later, his head tilted to the side and rolled off his neck.

All the spectators were horrified!

It was worse for the others by the black robed middle aged man’s side. Suddenly 2 more rays of sword energy flashed. But besides Yang Ye, no one else could see them.

A moment of silence later, the heads of the other 2 men tilted to the side and rolled off their necks just like the first middle aged man.

3 Emperors had been killed in an instant!

Everyone here was flabbergasted. At this moment, their minds were completely blank. However, it didn’t take too long for the members of the 4 great clans to instantly recover from their shock. Because Yang Ye was looking at them.

They were horrified when they saw Yang Ye look at them. They wanted to flee, but no one dared to do that.

Yang Ye’s gaze descended onto the beautiful women from the Mu Clan. He naturally recognized her because she was the woman, A’Qing, that Elder Mu had asked him to find. Moreover, he’d even asked Yang Ye to annihilate the Mu Clan if she was dead. Yang Ye remained silent for an instant before he said, “People from the Mu Clan can move aside.”

The beautiful woman heaved a sigh of relief when she heard him, and then she hurriedly led the others from the Mu Clan to the side.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye gazed at the Zhuge Clan, “Who’s Zhuge Yun?”

A breath of time passed after Yang Ye finished speaking, and then a woman finally stepped forward.

Yang Ye flicked a scroll over to her, “Your older brother, Zhuge Shenmo asked me to give it to you.”

The woman’s body trembled slightly, and then she said, “He’s dead, right?”

Yang Ye nodded, “Move aside.”

She took the scroll, glanced at him, and then moved to the Mu Clan’s side.

Meanwhile, the patriarch of the Zhuge Clan hurriedly stepped forward, “Young Brother Yang, it was our mistake. We’ll leave right now and guarantee to never offend White Deer Academy.”

“It’s too late now!” As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye’s figure vanished on the spot.

Hiss!

The Zhuge Clan’s patriarch’s head flew up into the air, and the heads of the other cultivators from the Zhuge Clan flew up as well!

The others here were horrified by the sight of this.

Flee!

They didn’t hesitate to turn around and flee. However, how could they be faster than Yang Ye’s sword? Those that fled the quickest were the first to die.

It was a slaughter!

Shrill cries resounded incessantly, and heads flew up incessantly. Pillars of blood were surging up incessantly into the air, and the surroundings were filled with blood!

The Mu Clan’s experts turned ghastly pale, and their bodies couldn’t help but tremble from the sight of this.

Xiao Bieli and the others were shocked by the scene before them as they hadn’t expected Yang Ye to carry out such a slaughter.

In less than 10 breaths of time, around 100 heads had left their bodies, and no one had been able to escape.

After Heaven’s Gravestone absorbed all the blood here, Yang Ye withdrew Heaven’s Gravestone back into his body, and then he gazed at the Mu Clan. All the experts of the Mu Clan couldn’t help but take a step backwards, and the legs of some even started shivering.

Yang Ye’s gaze descended onto the beautiful woman, A’Qing, and he said, “Elder Mu was very good to me, and I would have died on many occasions if it wasn’t for him. He can be considered as the only true master I’ve had in my life. You’re someone he cares about, so you and the Mu Clan can live.” He owed Elder Mu a huge debt, so he would naturally not harm someone Elder Mu cared about.

The experts of the Mu Clan heaved sighs of relief. They didn’t know who Yang Ye was talking about, nor did they want to know who Elder Mu was. All they did know was that they could live!

“Thank you!” The beautiful woman spoke in a low voice while her clenched fists finally relaxed. It would be a lie if she said that she wasn’t nervous. After all, Yang Ye was too terrifying when he started killing.

Yang Ye said, “Go back home.”

The beautiful woman nodded and glanced at Yang Ye. She seemed to want to ask him something, but she didn’t in the end. She expressed her gratitude again, and then led the forces of the Mu Clan away.

Meanwhile, Zhuge Yun asked, “Why did you spare me?”

Even though the Zhuge Clan’s experts had been completely slaughtered, her expression was extremely calm, and she showed no signs of anger. Of course, the main reason was that she didn’t dare to do so. She was no fool. She knew that her head would fly up into the air if she dared to reveal any anger.

Yang Ye glanced indifferently at her, “I knew your brother.”

Zhuge Yun asked, “What else did he say?”

Yang Ye replied, “He told me not to have any thoughts about you!”

Zhuge Yun was at a loss for words.

“Go on.” As soon as Yang Ye finished, Yang Ye looked up at the sky, and his eyes narrowed slightly.

Zhuge Yun glanced at Yang Ye, and then she turned around and left.

Once Zhuge Yun left, Xiao Bieli arrived by Yang Ye’s side. Suddenly, he frowned, looked up at the sky, and then remained silent for an instant before he asked, “Are you confident?”

Yang Ye nodded and said, “Where’s Yuxi? I didn’t see her here.”

Xiao Bieli replied, “She’s in closed door cultivation.”

Yang Ye nodded slightly. He was about to speak when an extremely formidable aura suddenly descended from the sky.

Xiao Bieli’s voice trembled, “Is... is that a Voider?”

It didn’t take long for an old man to float down from the sky.

Yang Ye’s face instantly fell when he saw the old man. It was that exact same old man who’d fought Lady that day, and he was a true Voider who’d comprehended the Laws of Time.

As soon as he saw Yang Ye, the old man’s face became gloomy as well, “It’s you!”

Eyes blaze with hatred when enemies face each other!
