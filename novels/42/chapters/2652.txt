Chapter 2653 – I’ll Kill You!

Surrender!

If he were being honest, it was the first time he felt that he was absolutely finished.

Because he’d guessed who was standing behind him!

However, he didn’t choose to give up.

As soon as those words were spoken, the hand paused for a moment, and he used that opportunity to stab his sword backward.

The Domain Sword!

Dual Domains!

His attack had only made it halfway before Yang Ye felt his figure being blasted away. He didn’t know how long his figure flew, all he did know was that his consciousness was fading.

It was like he’d experienced an entire era. Finally, Yang Ye felt himself stop, and then he heard footsteps.

However, he didn’t have the strength to stand up again.

Moreover, his head felt extremely heavy. A moment later, his head tilted to the side as he lost consciousness.

Just like that, a long time passed before Yang Ye slowly opened his eyes again.

His head felt like it was full of lead!

Yang Ye shook his head forcefully. Meanwhile, a voice came from afar, “What’s that sword doing in your possession?”

Yang Ye looked over toward the source of the voice.

At this moment, he saw his location clearly. He wasn’t in the endless black hole anymore, and he was on a ruined bridge. A woman was standing at the center of the bridge!

A woman in a black dress!

Yang Ye’s eyelids twitched from the sight of her.

There was a pitch black sword floating on her left, and there were two more swords floating before her. They were the two swords Yang Ye had been carrying.

Yang Ye heaved a sigh of relief. Obviously, the swords had saved him.

Yang Ye walked over slowly and glanced at the surroundings. Only a void existed in all directions, and this ruined bridge was the only material object here.

Where the heck am I?

Yang Ye was puzzled.

Suddenly, the woman’s voice resounded, “Looks like your mind needs to be cleared a little more!”Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Bam!

Yang Ye felt like he was struck by a sledgehammer, and then he fell unconscious again.

A long, long time later, Yang Ye woke up again. This time, he felt like his entire body had been hammered by a sledgehammer. He felt truly weak, and his head was absolutely heavy!

Meanwhile, a voice came from afar, “Are you awake now?”

Yang Ye looked up, and he saw the woman in black again.

Yang Ye’s eyelids twitched. He hesitated for a moment and suppressed the unrealistic thoughts in his heart. He stood up slowly and said, “They gave these swords to me!”

“Nonsense!” She suddenly turned to the side, “The owner of Heaven Executor isn’t even in this universe, and based on her character, she would never give this sword to you. Moreover, she lost it all those years ago due to certain reasons, so how could she have possibly given it to you? Do you want to die?”

As soon as she finished speaking, the black sword beside her started to tremble.

Her desire to kill was horrifying!

Yang Ye swallowed his saliva and hurriedly pointed at Past Life, “S-She gave me this sword. As for Heaven Executor, it willingly stayed with me. If you don’t believe me, you can ask them!”

Dammit! Why is she so violent?! She’s completely different from the woman in white!

She just attacks whenever she likes! Can’t she be a little reasonable?

She gazed at Yang Ye for a long time, and then she gazed at the swords. She took them in her grasp, and they didn’t resist her.

Some time later, she frowned slightly and glanced at Yang Ye, “My other form is truly blind! She actually chose you!”

Yang Ye’s face darkened.

Darn you! Don’t you know how to speak to people?

She gazed at Yang Ye in silence.

Yang Ye’s eyelids twitched because he noticed the desire to kill in her eyes. She actually wanted to kill him!

Yang Ye hurriedly stood up and said, “I-I want to make a report!”

She frowned slightly, “A report?”

Yang Ye hurriedly nodded, “Yes. I know of a place with a huge group of peak Destiny Realm experts. They are using certain methods to escape your detection. There are many people like that there.”

She gazed at Yang Ye in silence.

Yang Ye glanced at her and said, “I’m certain they are plotting something together there. If you don’t kill them now and allow them to grow, they may join forces to rebel against you!”

“Grow?” There was a wisp of ridicule on the corners of her mouth, “How much can trash like that grow?”

Yang Ye replied with a serious expression on his face, “It may be so, but I’m sure you’ve noticed that none of them are weaklings. If you let them remain free…”

She suddenly interrupted him and asked, “You want to use me to kill them?”

Yang Ye’s face stiffened.

Dammit! She’s no fool!

The woman walked over to Yang Ye and knocked his head with her sword, “Your strength is insufficient, but your mind is full of these sly ideas. I really don’t understand why my other form would choose you. It’s the first time I think I’m blind!”

“What the fuck can I do then?” Yang Ye suddenly spoke angrily, “Just take a look at that group of bastards! Which one of them hasn’t lived for tens of thousands of years? How long have I been alive? I’m only around 30! But what about them! They’ve lived for almost as long as this Three Dimensional Universe has existed. Fuck! Even a pig could become a god with that amount of time! So, what can I do? How would I fight them without these tricks?”

She replied indifferently, “Only the incompetent complain!”

Yang Ye shrugged, “I don’t think that using these methods are bad. Intelligence is a form of strength, isn’t it?”

She laughed coldly, “You’re just weak!”

Yang Ye spoke indifferently, “Yes, yes! You were born invincible!”

Her eyes narrowed slightly, “Are you unhappy? If you are, we can fight one on one!”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

Shameless?

They say he was shameless, but he wanted to ask them what true shamelessness was! Because this woman before him was truly shameless!

She ridiculed, “You dare not?”

Yang Ye fell silent for a moment and said, “Suppress your cultivation to mine, and then we’ll fight. Alright?”

Suppress her cultivation!

If she didn’t suppress her cultivation, he would definitely be no match for her. He knew that well.

But he could try if she suppressed her cultivation.

She glanced at Yang Ye, “Alright!”

As soon as she finished speaking, she immediately waved her hand, and a wave of sword energy slammed down upon Yang Ye!

Yang Ye’s expression changed. With a wave of his right hand, Executor appeared in his grasp, and then he stabbed it forward.

Hiss!

An ear piercing sound resounded, but just a moment later, Yang Ye’s expression changed drastically. It was because a sword had suddenly stabbed his stomach.

Blood sprayed!

But the woman in black was still standing on the spot!

Yang Ye looked up at her, “You didn’t suppress your cultivation at all!”

She laughed coldly, “I set the Destiny Realm, so what am I supposed to suppress? I’m in any realm I want to be in. Understand?”

Yang Ye almost spat out a mouthful of blood from the anger he felt. She was more shameless than Erya and Snowy!

Meanwhile, she suddenly gazed at Yang Ye’s stomach, and then Yang Ye’s face instantly became solemn.

She gazed at him, “What is it?”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and said, “Perhaps we can talk about it!”

She was about to ridicule him, but she seemed to have thought of something and suddenly fell silent. Some time later, she asked, “Talk about what?”

Yang Ye was inwardly relieved and said, “You’re injured?”

Actually, he’d felt something was off with her from the very beginning. He felt that she was injured.

Because she was very different from when he’d first seen her in the Origin World!

She laughed coldly upon hearing Yang Ye, “I am injured. Why? You want to try and see if you can kill me?”

Yang Ye heaved a sigh of relief in his heart.

Qi Bitian and Tian Xiu were probably fine!

When he was tracking those three energies earlier, Qi Bitian and Tian Xiu’s energies had vanished into thin air. It wasn’t the type of vanishing he would associate with death, and it was more like how the Unfettered One’s energy had vanished!

Even then, he was still quite worried, and so he’d continued pursuing the final trace of energy.

Now that he’d heard her, he was even more certain that they had probably been teleported away by her.

But he didn’t know where she’d teleported them to!

Yang Ye thought for a moment and said, “Why don’t you tell me what you want instead?”

She replied indifferently, “You’re quite sensible.”

She pointed at his stomach, “I want to go inside!”

Yang Ye’s face stiffened. Go inside? Inside the Primordial Pagoda? She wants to go inside the pagoda?!

Her voice instantly turned icy cold, “What? I can’t?”

Yang Ye gulped and said, “Um… Why?”

She frowned, “I’m asking you if I can. I’ll kill you if you refuse!”

Yang Ye was stunned speechless.

She was already holding her sword. She was telling Yang Ye that she wasn’t joking!

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and said, “Can I ask why?”

She replied indifferently, “You can!”

Yang Ye asked, “Why?”

She glanced at him, “No reason!”

Yang Ye’s face twitched. He really wanted to swing his sword at her! Because she was clearly just pranking him!

But he was no match for her!

Meanwhile, she glanced at the surroundings and said, “Make a decision. Yes or no.”

Yang Ye fell silent for a long time and asked, “Do I have a choice?”

She smiled coldly, and then she transformed into a ray of light that entered the Primordial Pagoda.

Yang Ye’s face was extremely colorful.
