Chapter 2480 – Unfathomable!

Never submit!

Yang Ye shook his head and smiled.

Yang Lianshuang really knows how to cause a commotion.

It didn’t take long for her to walk out of the city. She noticed Yang Ye and was stunned for a moment before speaking softly, “When did you arrive?”

Yang Ye smiled, “I just arrived.”

Yang Lianshuang nodded slightly, and then she looked up at the middle aged man’s group, “I believe in humanitarianism, so I’ll give you some advice. It’s best if you leave immediately!”

The middle aged man’s face fell, “Yang Lianshuang, you’re really pushing it!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he pressed down his right hand, and a wave of powerful pressure slammed down toward the city.

The pressure of a Limitbreaker Realm expert!

Suddenly, a flying sword shot up into the air from below.

Hiss!

The middle aged man’s right hand suddenly flew off into the air!

The middle aged man and all the other experts around him were stunned. They were stunned for over two seconds before they finally recovered. The middle aged man was shocked and gazed at Yang Ye.

Yang Ye ignored them and gazed at Yang Lianshuang. He smiled, “Aren’t you going to invite me in?”

She replied, “I thought you would kill all of them!”

Yang Ye shook his head, “We’ll see about it later. If it’s necessary, I’ll just kill them all at once!”

Yang Lianshuang nodded, “Come on, I’ll take you to see Elder Yuan!”

As she spoke, she led Yang Ye into the city.

Meanwhile, in the sky outside the city. The middle aged man’s face was extremely unsightly, and a long time passed before he spoke solemnly, “Come on! Let’s go notify the Sect Master!”

It didn’t take long for them to vanish from the sky.

…

Yang Ye and Yang Lianshuang entered the city. There weren’t many people here, and there were just a few hundred thousand people. Many of them had come with them from the large universe, so they naturally recognized Yang Ye. All of them stopped when they saw him, so a commotion surged through the sky.

Yang Ye was here!

More and more people rushed in Yang Ye and Yang Lianshuang’s direction.

Countless people were still grateful to Yang Ye. If it hadn’t been for him, many of them would have probably died in the large universe.

More and more were arriving.

Yang Ye stopped, glanced at them and said, “Long time no see!”

All of them bowed slightly to them.

Yang Ye glanced at them. All of them didn’t possess very high cultivations, but he could sense that all of them were happy with their lives here.

Peaceful!

At many times, most people didn’t seek a wealthy life or an eternal life, all they sought was a peaceful life. Actually, many people were very happy with just that. Especially these people from the large universe. Only those who had experienced war would cherish such peace!

Yang Ye and Yang Lianshuang arrived at a hall. Actually, it was the Royal Palace. However, it was quite small, and so it was no different to a normal hall.

Yang Lianshuang suddenly said, “I got bored, so I made all of this for fun.”

Yang Ye nodded, “What’s your current cultivation?”

Yang Lianshuang shrugged, “I just reached the Limitbreaker Realm. Needless to say, the spirit energy here is much better than the large universe. If I was still there, I can only wonder what my cultivation would be right now. No wonder so many people want to go to a higher universe!”

She gazed at him and continued, “Right, now that you’re here, I just happen to have something to tell you.”

Yang Ye asked, “What is it?”

She replied, “I’m returning home!”

Yang Ye was slightly stunned, “You’re returning home?”

She nodded, “I’ve been out here for too, too long. I don’t know how it is back there. I’ve been afraid of returning until now because it has been countless years since I arrived here. So, if I did return now, there would probably be nothing left there. But not too long ago, a mysterious old man told me that I can head home. The time here doesn’t flow the same way as it does there. Or it should be said that the passage of time is different between our universes. In any case, I don’t really understand it. All I do know is that if I return now, it would be equivalent to leaving for 10 years.”

“A mysterious old man?” Yang Ye frowned slightly, “What did he look like?”

She replied, “An old man carrying a bamboo chest on his back!”

An old man with a bamboo chest!

Yang Ye was stunned.

Yang Lianshuang had met the old man too.

She glanced at him, “You’ve met him too?”

Yang Ye nodded, “H-He has been to your home?”

Yang Lianshuang spoke solemnly, “I’m not very sure. However, he should be aware of it. He said that it is a pretty good place, and we should cherish it!”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “What was he trying to say?”

Yang Lianshuang explained, “He meant that while it’s impossible to maintain absolute fairness over there, it’s an extremely fair world when compared to the other worlds. At my home, those with power and wealth still remain at the top of society, but so long as you work hard, you can gain power and wealth too. Moreover, there are laws in our world. While it’s impossible to maintain absolute fairness, the laws are able to restrain many, many people.”

She paused for a moment at this point and continued, “Besides that, while we have wars there, there are very few. Moreover, all of them are small-scale wars. In short, while our lifespan is very short there, we live peacefully. It’s an era that’s bound by laws. While we lack a lot of lifespan and power when compared to many of this world, we don’t have to live our days in terror and anxiety.”

Yang Ye spoke solemnly, “Laws are able to restrain the people of your home?”

Yang Lianshuang smiled, “Of course. Everyone is equal before the law there. Of course, it’s not completely true. But the law can restrain many, many people. Actually, it’s normal. Does a world with absolute fairness even exist? It’s really, really not bad that my world was able to accomplish that. To be honest, I miss my home even more now. Now that you’re here, I can bid farewell to you!”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and asked, “Do you want me to send you there?”

She shook her head, “That mysterious old man gave me a treasure, and I can use it to return.” She hesitated for a moment and said, “When you’re free, can you take Snowy to that world of mine?”

Yang Ye asked, “Why?”

She rolled her eyes at him, “Can’t you come visit me? Why else?”

Yang Ye smiled, “of course. However, I’m going to Eternal Kingdom now, so I can only go there in the future.”

Yang Lianshuang nodded, “I asked you to bring Snowy because those people of my world have severely damaged the world there. Especially when it comes to spirit energy, it practically doesn’t exist. If Snowy goes there, she can help repair my world. Besides that, there are many fun things there. She will definitely be very happy there.”

“Are there tasty things there?” Erya suddenly appeared by Yang Ye’s side, and she was licking a tanghulu.

Yang Lianshuang was stunned and gazed at Yang Ye, “Who’s this young girl?”

Yang Ye was about to speak when Erya suddenly said, “I’m Erya, Snowy and Big Brother Yang’s friend. Big Sister, you said there are a lot of fun things in your world, so are there tasty things too?”

Yang Lianshuang glanced at Erya and nodded, “There are lots of delicious food there, enough to last you a lifetime!”

Erya’s eyes lit up. Yang Ye, on the other hand, shook his head and laughed bitterly, “She can eat your entire world!”

Erya glared at Yang Ye with displeasure and said, “Big Brother Yang, can I go there with her?”

Yang Ye was quite hesitant.

Yang Ye thought for a long time before he glanced at Yang Lianshuang and said, “Can the treasure that old man gave you teleport all of you over there?”

Yang Lianshuang nodded, “It can. It’s a teleportation formation. According to him, he is the only one in our universe who has this teleportation formation. It’s something he established there in the past, and it’s the only safer way to get there! Because he said that there’s a powerful barrier around our world, and it has trapped our galaxy, but it is also protecting our galaxy.”

She gazed at Yang Ye and continued, “You know… I feel like my world is not ordinary at all. There is no other world like it throughout the universe. Moreover, when compared to other worlds, it’s simply too weak. However, that world of ours remains in existence. Right, how strong is that old man with the bamboo chest?”

Yang Ye spoke solemnly, “Very, very strong. Unfathomable even!”

Yang Lianshuang replied, “See! That world of ours is really extraordinary. Because he had quite a complicated expression on his face when he spoke about it. Moreover, it felt like he was slightly afraid of it. That’s just a feeling I had.”

Extraordinary!

Yang Ye fell silent for a long time, and then he gazed at Erya, “Erya, if you’re going with your Big Sister Lianshuang, then remember that your mission isn’t to eat, it’s to protect her well. Besides that, come back after having fun for some time.”

Erya was overjoyed. Meanwhile, Yang Ye added, “But you must promise me that you’ll listen to her. Besides that, you must not act rashly there or go berserk. In any case, just listen to her!”

Erya kept nodding. She would naturally not refuse at a time like this.Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Suddenly, Snowy appeared before Yang Ye. She gazed at Yang Ye and blinked. It was because she’d heard Yang Lianshuang say that there were many fun things in her world.

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and asked, “You want to go too?”

Snowy nodded and raised her paw. She was saying that she would return after having fun for this amount of days.

Actually, even she didn’t know how many days her paw represented.

Yang Ye was about to speak when Yang Lianshuang suddenly said, “Let her come with me. She can help me purify the air there. The air over there is terrible.”

Erya added, “Don’t worry, Big Brother Yang. No one can harm Snowy while I’m there. Moreover, Snowy has that thing which the old geezer gave her, and even I think that thing is very dangerous. So, Snowy is very safe.”

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment, but it didn’t take long for him to recall that he was going to Eternal Kingdom next. So, he stopped hesitating.

As soon as Yang Ye nodded with approval, both Snowy and Erya jumped for joy.
