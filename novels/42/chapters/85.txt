Chapter 86 – Seizing The Treasure!

A cave had been dug open a few kilometers beneath Void Mountain which was where the Sword Sect resided. This cave was extremely vast, and it wasn’t a problem for it to accommodate a few thousands of people.

There were countless Moonlight Stones embedded on the walls of the cave, and the illumination of the Moonlight Stones made it seem as if it was daytime within the cave.

There was a pool of blood at the center of the cave. It was extremely large, and it occupied almost 50% of the cave. Besides being filled with blood, there were also some white bones within the pool of blood. However, those bones didn’t belong to beasts but to humans instead!

There was a fist sized blood red pearl floating in the air above the pool of blood. The blood red pearl seemed as if it was made from fresh blood, and it was a gorgeous red in color.

There were four black robed figures standing around the pool of blood. At this moment, these figures were pouring their Profound Energy into the red pearl that floated above the pool of blood, and with the Profound Energy it received from the four of them, the blood red pearl ceaselessly emanated a form of strange energy. This energy was dark grey in color, and it slowly drifted towards the surroundings under their control.

When Su Qingshi rushed over here and saw the pool of blood and the pearl, her expression changed drastically. Right when she was about to make a move, she suddenly noticed something, and she frowned before swiftly flashing towards the back.

Yang Ye had traveled at full speed for almost four hours yet was still unable to catch up to Su Qingshi. However, he’d obtained great gains all along the way. He’d encounter numerous corpses all along the way, and all of them were killed by Su Qingshi. Su Qingshi looked down upon their possessions, but Yang Ye didn’t!

He’d plundered six spatial rings all along the way, and all of them were spatial rings that possessed large spaces within them. Most of these corpses belonged to experts at the First Heaven Realm and King Realm. Yang Ye felt slight disdain towards the possessions of First Heaven Realm experts, but he really wanted the possessions of King Realm experts.

All along the way, besides those six spatial rings, Yang Ye had obtained around 3,000 plus Energy Stones, 20 plus high-grade Yellow Rank Dark Treasures, and even two low-grade Profound Rank Dark Treasures. One of those Profound Rank treasures was a piece of back armor that protected the heart, and Yang Ye immediately wore it upon obtaining it. The other Profound Rank treasure was a saber that had human bones embedded into it. Yang Ye had no use of it, so he casually tossed it into his spatial ring.

Besides these treasures, there were also some cultivation techniques, and two amongst them were even at the Profound Rank. However, Yang Ye gave up on cultivating them as soon as he read their introduction. Because practically all of these cultivation techniques required blood as a medium or required other inhumane methods to cultivate.

Even though he’d been gathering treasures all along the way, Yang Ye hadn’t slowed down at all. The little fellow said that there was danger, then it meant that there truly was danger, and he didn’t want anything to happen to Su Qingshi.

After he took a ring of a black robed figure, Yang Ye swept his gaze towards the surroundings, and he didn’t slow down as he continued running forward. Right at this moment, something flashed before his eyes, and then Su Qingshi appeared in front of him.

Su Qingshi’s beautiful brows knit together as she gazed at Yang Ye who was gasping slightly for breath, and she asked. “What’re you doing here?”

Yang Ye heaved a sigh of relief when he noticed that Su Qingshi was fine, and he said, “The little fellow said that it’s dangerous, so I was slightly worried!”

Su Qingshi’s eyelids twitched lightly when she heard this. Is he worried about me?

When she thought up to here, a wisp of an unusual feeling flashed in Su Qingshi’s heart. But it was quickly suppressed by her. She glanced at Yang Ye and said, “It’s extremely dangerous inside there. Turn back now and converge with the experts of the Sword Sect!”

“Then what about you?” asked Yang Ye.

Su Qingshi turned around to gaze towards the depths of the passageway, and she said in a low voice, “I’m going to spoil what they’re doing!”

Right at this moment, the violet mink pointed its little claw towards the distance, and it seemed to be saying that it intended to go there as well.

Yang Ye originally intended to persuade Su Qingshi, but he instantly gave up when he saw the little fellow express its intention to go over as well. Truthfully speaking, he was very worried about Su Qingshi and the little fellow, but he knew that he couldn’t ask Su Qingshi and the little fellow to not act in this way because he was worried. Because both Su Qingshi and the little fellow were free to do as they pleased, and he didn’t have any authority to tell them what to do.

Most importantly, they had the ability to protect themselves! Presently, he was the weakest amongst all of them present here. So, when he thought up to here, Yang Ye felt extremely helpless, especially helpless. He’d already worked very hard, but no matter how hard he tried, it was impossible to change the fact that he was current strength was extremely weak.

As if it sensed Yang Ye’s feelings, the violet mink touched Yang Ye’s face with its little claws, and then it rubbed its head against his head.

Su Qingshi seemed to understand Yang Ye’s thoughts as well. Her lips moved lightly, yet she didn’t say anything in the end.

Yang Ye’d heart felt warm when the little fellow tried to console him, and he rubbed the little fellow’s head before he looked at Su Qingshi and said, “You go with the little fellow. Both of you be careful!”

He really wanted to say that he was going with them, but he didn’t because he knew that he would only be a burden for them.

Right at this moment, Su Qingshi’s expression suddenly changed, and she said, “Shit! They seem to have noticed us, and they intend to flee! Leave, quickly!”

As soon as she finished speaking, Su Qingshi flashed towards the distance, and she vanished before Yang Ye’s eyes in the blink of an eye. After that, rumbling resounded from extremely far away.

The violet mink blinked, and then it swung its little claw and vanished from Yang Ye’s shoulder.

Yang Ye was stared blankly for a brief moment, and then he withdrew a high-grade Strength Talisman and slapped it on his body. Right when he intended to charge forward, a shrill and grim voice suddenly resounded from afar. “AH!!! The Pearl of Baleful Blood was taken by that violet colored little fellow. Quickly chase after it!!!”

This voice had just finished speaking when Yang Ye noticed a strand of violet light flash in the distant passageway. In the next moment, this violet light appeared before Yang Ye. However, the violet mink’s claws were holding a fist sized and red colored pearl at this moment. The violet mink seemed to be extremely excited and happy, and its little eyes blinked without end.

“This....” Yang Ye was slightly dazed as he gazed at the pearl in the little fellow’s claws.

The violet mink glanced at Yang Ye, and then it pointed behind Yang Ye. After that, it transformed into a strand of violet light that entered into Yang Ye’s Vortex Dantian under his astounded gaze.

Yang Ye was stunned for around the time of a single breath, and then he turned around and ran back towards the entrance. Even though he didn’t know what the little fellow had done, he’d understood what the little fellow meant. It asked him to flee quickly.

Yang Ye hadn’t even ran for a few meters when he sensed a few terrifying auras coming from behind him. Yang Ye was shocked in his heart and hurriedly utilized the Gale Steps technique as he ran forward madly. Yang Ye didn’t know what cultivation realms those terrifying auras possessed, but they were undoubtedly not existences that he could go against right now!

“Don’t waste your time on that woman. Quickly chase after that violet colored Darkbeast. We must get the Pearl of Baleful Blood back!”

Yang Ye heard these words from afar, and he couldn’t help but think in his heart. That pearl the little fellow held in its little claws just now was that Pearl of Baleful Blood?

He was slightly curious and bewildered, but he didn’t have the time to look at the pearl now.

Right at this moment, Yang Ye’s expression changed abruptly, and he instinctively executed the Gale Steps technique and flashed horizontally to the left.

Bang!

A deep hole that was over 10m deep appeared where Yang Ye stood just now.

Yang Ye’s eyelids twitched as he gazed at the deep hole, and then he raised his head to look at a black robed bald man that had suddenly appeared before him. Yang Ye’s heart shook as he gazed at this man because this person’s strength was absolutely not inferior to Feng Yi.

A wisp of surprise flashed through the black robed man’s eyes when he noticed Yang Ye had actually dodged his attack, and then he swung his right hand, causing a strand of powerful energy to shoot violently at Yang Ye.

Yang Ye’s expression changed. He utilized Gale Steps once more and dodged to the side. However, he was slightly too late. Fortunately, this strand of powerful energy that was originally aimed at his heart deviated from its target and struck his left shoulder instead.

Bang!

Yang Ye was blasted flying, and he collided with the wall.

The black robed man frowned when he noticed Yang Ye was still alive. This ant at the Mortal Realm actually avoided two of my attacks? How could this be possible? Even though I only utilized less than half of my strength, it isn’t something that someone at the Mortal Realm can avoid!The black robed man was just about to attack once more. Right at this moment, an anxious voice sounded out from behind the black robed man. “Has the Pearl of Baleful Blood been retrieved? If it has been retrieved, then leave this place immediately. The Sword Sect already knows about this place.”

When he heard this voice, the black robed man’s expression turned grim, and he paid no further attention to Yang Ye and flashed towards the distance.

Yang Ye instantly heaved a sigh of relief when he saw the black robed man leave. He wiped off the fresh blood that flowed from the corner of his mouth, and then he glanced at the Profound Rank armor on his left shoulder that had already sunken in. Yang Ye said in a low voice, “My strength is still too weak in the end. I must find a way to improve my strength after I leave this place!”

Right at this moment, a miserable and shrill cry sounded out from the direction the black robed man fled towards. In the next moment, four middle aged men that wore bluish white robes flew over on their swords, and the four of them were slightly stunned upon noticing Yang Ye.

One of the middle aged men were just about to speak when the sound of battle suddenly resounded from afar, causing their expressions to change. They paid no further attention to Yang Ye, and they flew swiftly towards Su Qingshi.

Yang Ye heaved a sigh of relief upon noticing their arrival because Su Qingshi would probably not be in danger any longer, whereas, the members of the Ghost Sect were probably finished.

Yang Ye wrapped his injuries in a careless manner, and then he turned around and walked towards the exit.

After he walked out of the exit, Yang Ye walked towards the grey wolf’s cave. He wanted to see exactly what sort of treasure that pearl the little fellow stole was because it actually made the little fellow take such a risk to steal it!
