Chapter 2358 – Executor!

Just like that, Yang Ye moved the sword formation into the Primordial Pagoda.

However, there were many other subsequent problems to solve. For example, how to activate it and how to merge the Primordial Pagoda’s Earth Energy with this formation. They were difficult problems. Fortunately, Sword Scroll was willing to study it!

An extraordinary sword formation!

As far as Yang Ye was concerned, it would be an extraordinary trump card for him if he could master its usage.

Of course, the precondition was that Sword Scroll could fully study it! However, Yang Ye was confident in her!

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts and left with Snowy in his arms.

On the surface, Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings and continued forward. It didn’t take long for him to see stone stairs, and they extended all the way to a distant mountain.

It was like a stairway to the heavens!

Yang Ye walked over with Snowy, and as he walked, Snowy started to glance around.

A short while later, Snowy leaped down and sniffed lightly. In a short moment, the stone stairway seemed to turn slightly ethereal, and it even started to tremble violently.

Yang Ye was stunned speechless.

A short while later, Snowy patted the stone stairway, and then a white little dragon flew out of it!

A spirit vein!

Snowy swiftly grabbed its claw and dragged it into the Primordial Pagoda!

Yang Ye’s face froze on the spot. A short while later, Snowy appeared on his shoulder, and he hesitated for a moment and said, “Snowy, shouldn’t you have asked it for its opinion first?”

Snowy blinked, and then returned to the Primordial Pagoda. She went over to it, pointed at it, then pointed at herself. Obviously, she was asking if it was willing to stay with her!

The white dragon glanced at the axe in Snowy’s grasp and nodded.

Snowy put the axe away, patted it on its head, and then returned to Yang Ye’s shoulder.

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

Yang Ye sized up the white dragon. It was a spirit vein indeed, but it was much inferior when compared to the one they obtained from the Immortal Estate. Of course, it was better than nothing. Presently, he possessed a world, so he required such spirit veins!

Yang Ye sped up with Snowy in his arms, and it didn’t take long for him to arrive at the mountain peak. There was a huge circular platform there, and it was floating in midair. A huge black sword stood above the platform!

Yang Ye glanced at the stone tablet on the right, and there were four characters there “承天剑台”!

The Sky Sword Platform!

Yang Ye tapped the tip of his foot down and appeared on the platform, and then he gazed at Snowy. The latter blinked, and then hugged his face and kept rubbing her head against his.

Yang Ye spoke helplessly, “Little fellow, I’m asking if there are treasures here.”

Treasures!

Snowy shook her head without hesitating.

Yang Ye pointed at the huge sword and said, “Look properly. Is there anything within it?”

Snowy glanced at the huge sword and shook her head.

Yang Ye was quite disappointed, and then he left the platform with Snowy. Suddenly, Sword Scroll appeared before him. She glanced at the platform, waved her right hand, and a sword descended onto the platform.

In an instant, the entire platform shook violently, and then a ray of sword energy shot up into the clouds.

Just like the name of the platform, it shot into the sky!

More and more sword energy was appearing. A short while later, the sky was covered by countless rays of sword energy.

Yang Ye gazed at her, “What’s that?”Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Sword Scroll explained softly, “A sword formation, an Anti-Air Sword Formation. Once it’s activated, any expert that passes above the Northern Sword Sect will be minced into bits. Even a Limitbreaker Realm expert can’t dream of escaping it with ease.”

She gazed at Yang Ye and continued, “This sword sect really isn’t ordinary.”

Yang Ye asked, “Why do you say that?”

She explained, “Both these sword formations have ancient inscriptions on them. It’s impossible for it to exist in this world, absolutely impossible! Moreover, I just noticed that those 100,000 swords were nurtured with a special method, the Sword Nurturing Technique! It’s something that was possessed by the organization I used to belong to. Even over there, it was an extremely well-hidden secret technique, it was a core ability. It was very rare to see even over there, but it exists here!”

Yang Ye spoke solemnly, “So you think the master of this sect was likely to have come from the Eternal Dimension?”

She replied, “I’m not sure, but it’s very likely.”

Yang Ye said, “I don’t understand something. Both the sword formations here possess absolute strength, so why was the Northern Sword Sect still annihilated?”

She glanced at him, “Always remember that there’s someone stronger in this world. You may be strong, but there are those who are stronger.”

Snowy pointed at herself to ask if she was strong!

Sword Scroll glanced at Snowy, thought for a moment, and replied seriously, “Yes, very!”

She wasn’t just trying to compliment Snowy. Even in the Eternal Dimension, a Sprite Progenitor’s status was very special. While Sprite Progenitors weren’t fond of killing, if they did fight, it would be absolutely terrifying.

But no organization would or dare to offend a Sprite Progenitor. Because just a single sniff from a Sprite Progenitor could strip a sect of all its spirit energy.

Snowy’s eyes lit up when she heard Sword Scroll, and then she pointed at Yang Ye. Obviously, she was asking about Yang Ye.

Sword Scroll glanced at Yang Ye and replied indifferently, “No!”

Yang Ye was speechless.

Snowy wasn’t convinced because Yang Ye was undoubtedly the strongest in her heart.

Sword Scroll didn’t argue about that with Snowy. She glanced at the platform and said, “Move it in there too. It’ll be very useful in the future!”

Snowy puckered her lips while aversion covered her face.

Sword Scroll’s lips couldn’t help but twitch from the sight of this. She really wanted to curse because Yang Ye and her standards weren’t on the same level as Snowy at all. As far as Snowy was concerned, only Pseudo Divine Treasures and Divine Treasures were worthy of her. Now, she may not even be so welcoming of Pseudo Divine Treasures.

Yang Ye glanced at Snowy and shook his head. They weren’t on the same level anymore.

Around ten minutes later, Yang Ye continued forward with Snowy after moving the formation into the Primordial Pagoda. This time, Sword Scroll stayed by his side because she was growing curious about the Northern Sword Sect.

A long time later, they stopped. There were three halls before them, and there was a huge black sword floating above each of them. The swords formed a triangular pattern.

“Interesting!” Sword Scroll spoke abruptly, “Another sword formation!”

Yang Ye gazed at her, and she spoke softly, “Aren’t you skilled at concealment? Use your Sword Domain and try going over there.”

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and concealed himself with the Sword Domain, and then he walked over with Snowy. As soon as he got close to the three halls, the swords above them shook violently, and then sword energy appeared all around Yang Ye.

Yang Ye’s expression changed slightly, and he immediately swung his saber.

Hiss!

The sword energy was obliterated.

Yang Ye gazed at Sword Scroll, and the latter spoke softly, “Take it!”

Yang Ye was stunned speechless.

Sword Scroll said, “It’s a defensive formation, and anyone who gets close will be annihilated. While it’s damaged slightly now, it doesn’t matter to us. I’m confident that I can repair and even improve it. So, move it inside!”

Yang Ye naturally wouldn’t refuse, and he immediately placed it within the Primordial Pagoda.

Yang Ye took Snowy to the first hall, and there were four characters above it “北荒剑殿”!

Northern Sword Hall!

Yang Ye walked into it with Snowy. The hall was empty, completely empty. Obviously, others had plundered it all. The Northern Sword Sect had been annihilated, so others had definitely come to seek treasures.

As for why the sword formation hadn’t been taken, it was mainly because it wasn’t active, so it was just an inanimate thing. Moreover, even if they could notice its presence, they wouldn’t have the ability to take it. After all, activating a sword formation required the corresponding technique.

If he didn’t have Sword Scroll by his side, he wouldn’t be able to use it either!

Yang Ye glanced at the hall and shook his head. There was nothing here. He was about to leave when Sword Scroll suddenly went to the end of the hall, and there was a sword carved on the wall there!

It was over 1m long!

Meanwhile, Snowy’s gaze descended upon the sword, and she seemed quite curious.

Sword Scroll’s eyes gradually turned solemn.

Yang Ye asked, “What is it?”

Sword Scroll spoke softly, “Now, I’m certain that this Northern Sword Sect was from the Eternal Dimension. Or I should say that their sect master was from there.”

Yang Ye asked, “Why?”

She replied softly, “Do you know what sword this is?”

Yang Ye shook his head.

She explained softly, “The number one sword of the Eternal Dimension—Executor! A sword that can execute the heart, emperors, and gods.”

Executor!

Yang Ye gazed at the sword. It was over 1m long, dark blue, and without a hilt or a handle. It was just a blade and body, and there was a hole on its tip.

Sword Scroll suddenly asked, “Do you know why there’s a hole in its tip?”

Yang Ye shook his head.

Sword Scroll explained, “According to legend, it was so strong even destiny feared it. So, it forcefully seized a bit of its tip, so its blade would never be whole!”

Yang Ye asked, “Who has it now?”

Sword Scroll shook her head, “It’s missing, and it has no owner. Its origins are extremely mysterious, and no one knows how it came to be. It’s a legend in the Eternal Universe. Even my sect knew very little about it. The only records my sect had about it was—Feared by Destiny!”

Yang Ye was about to speak when Snowy suddenly appeared before the wall. She touched the sword while a trace of curiosity and bewilderment appeared in her eyes.

Suddenly, at the Sword Ruins of Eternal Border, a weak sword howl resounded from within an ancient tomb deep beneath a mountain.

It only lasted for an instant!
