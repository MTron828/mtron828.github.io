Chapter 2385 – Don’t Even Think of Leaving!

Suddenly, Oxxy walked over to Snowy and pointed at the rear mountains.

Snowy clearly understood what it meant and hurriedly chased after Erya.

Oxxy glanced at the rear mountains. That was all it could do. If Snowy couldn’t stop Erya, then it couldn’t do anything about it either. Oxxy didn’t dare to offend Erya, and it was taking a risk by reminding Snowy.

On the Ascension Platform, the Primal Vicious Tiger glanced at Oxxy, hesitated for a moment, and walked over, “She… is very dangerous!”

It was naturally referring to Erya!

Oxxy glanced at the tiger and replied, “Keep… a low profile!”

Keep a low profile!

It was a necessity in the Primordial Pagoda!

On a huge rock somewhere behind Void Mountain, the Primal True Dragon was snoring.

Sleeping was actually a form of cultivation to demon beasts like it. Or perhaps it should be said that a period of waiting, waiting until they evolve!

Suddenly, it seemed to have sensed something and opened its eyes. At the same time, a wave of powerful Dragon Pressure rippled out of it and slammed down!

Meanwhile, Erya had suddenly appeared before it, and she just ignored the pressure and slapped it away. After that, she strode over to the dragon and grabbed its head before it could even do anything.

The Primal True Dragon immediately started growling.

She grinned as she gazed at it, and then she licked her lips, “You’ll definitely be tasty!”

The dragon was terrified unconscious by these words.

Erya wasn’t joking and was about to eat it. But at the critical moment, Snowy appeared by her side. She hugged Erya and ceaselessly waved her claws to display that Erya couldn’t eat it.

Snowy seemed to have thought of something and quickly passed a tanghulu to Erya.

Erya glanced between it and the dragon, and she was slightly hesitant.

Snowy pointed at the Primal True Dragon and waved her paws swiftly. She was saying that she wanted it to help her fight!

Erya glanced helplessly at the dragon. Actually, she’d been a little impulsive earlier. Now that she’d calmed down, even she felt that she couldn’t just eat it. Or it should be said that her reasons weren’t sufficient!

She needed a better reason!

Erya felt much better once she thought up to this point. She passed the dragon to Snowy, and Snowy dragged it all the way to the Ascension Platform.

Meanwhile, the dragon didn’t dare to open its eyes!

It was playing dead!

It was all the dragon could do.

Erya was too terrifying!

On the Ascension Platform, Snowy glanced at the Primal Demons here, and then she looked up at the sky.

She was waiting!

Waiting for Yang Ye’s command!

Once Yang Ye allowed it, she would lead these demons out to attack!

Outside the Primordial Pagoda.

Once the Guardian gave the order, more and more experts rushed over. In just a short while, four people had arrived here. They were the masters of the Freedom Sect, Creation Sect, Longevity Sect, and another middle aged man.

Obviously, they were getting serious.

The Guardian in front of Yang Ye laughed coldly, “Yang Ye, there are 7 Limitbreaker Realm experts here now if we’re included. Let me see how you’ll fight 7 Limitbreaker Realm experts on your own!”

As soon as he finished speaking, their auras slammed down at Yang Ye. Moreover, a wave of mysterious energy sealed off the surroundings!

A formation!

A powerful formation had appeared here, and it had sealed off the area!

The gray robed old man spoke indifferently, “Yang Ye, this is a Worldbound Formation. Once it seals off an area, even a Three World Realm expert can’t escape it. Besides that, it will take the joint forces of 5 Three World Realm experts to affect this formation from the outside.” His face gradually turned icy cold at this point, “You’re dead!”

As soon as he finished speaking, 7 powerful auras arrived before Yang Ye.

Yang Ye’s face was calm as he suddenly drew his sword and swung it!

Hiss!

As soon as it descended, a gap was cut open in the auras, and then they dispersed in succession. Meanwhile, a powerful wave of energy surged like a torrent at Yang Ye.

Yang Ye frowned slightly and swung his sword again.

Bang!

An explosion resounded, and then he was blasted far away.

Yang Ye stomped his foot down over 10km away.

Bang!

The space in a huge area shook violently while he relied on the counterforce to stop himself.

Yang Ye looked up, and the 7 Limitbreaker Realm experts were standing together. That attack had carried their joint strength.

Compared to Yang Ye, they had an even more solemn expression.

While they hadn’t used their full strength earlier, even a Two World Realm expert would never be able to resist it with such ease. But Yang Ye had!

Yang Ye possessed the strength of two worlds?

As soon as they thought up to this point, it felt quite absurd to them. After all, Yang Ye was just at the True Dao Realm!

Meanwhile, the gray robed old man suddenly said, “Don’t hold back to avoid any unexpected turns of events!”

They nodded and were about to attack, but Yang Ye suddenly vanished on the spot, and then a ray of sword energy tore through space.

The gray robed old man’s eyes narrowed slightly, and he was about to attack with the others. However, a wave of powerful aura appeared here, and then a colossus appeared behind them!

It was Oxxy!

At this moment, Oxxy had returned to his true form. However, for the sake of making fighting easier, Oxxy had made himself slightly smaller. Even then, he was like a hill to the gray robed old man’s group!

Oxxy swung the Primordial Axe of Creation at them from behind!

The world turned ethereal before this swing!

Oxxy’s physical strength combined with the Primordial Axe of Creation was something that even Yang Ye feared quite a bit!

As soon as it descended, the gray robed old man and the others shuddered with fear. They didn’t go head-on against it because their intuition told them that if they did, they would definitely be blasted into mush!

So, all of them retreated.

Actually, they could stop Oxxy’s attack if they joined forces. But at this moment, the attack carried the strength to destroy two worlds, and they panicked a little when facing it. So, they simultaneously chose to dodge!

This retreat of theirs had obviously given Yang Ye an opportunity. He was helpless against their joint forces, but he could do a lot when it was just a one on one battle.

Yang Ye flashed over to one of the Guardians, and the latter’s expression changed drastically. He was about to retreat when Yang Ye’s sword descended!

The Sword Domain!

Two swings!

Yang Ye hadn’t used Heavenrend because he wanted a guaranteed kill!

As soon as the second swing descended, the Guardian knew it was impossible to escape and could only go head-on against it. A wave of powerful energy immediately swept out of the Guardian. At the same time, he clenched his fists and slammed them at Yang Ye.

Bang! Bang!

At this moment, the Guardian hadn’t dared to hold back at all and had used all his strength!

The sword descended swiftly!

Bang!

An explosion resounded, and then both Yang Ye and the Guardian were pushed backward repeatedly. But unlike Yang Ye, the Guardian’s body collapsed inch by inch as it moved back, and the Guardian was gone when his figure had moved over 1km back!

An instant kill!

The remaining 6 turned pale from the sight of this.

Even though they knew Yang Ye had the strength to kill Limitbreaker Realm experts, it was different when they watched him kill a Limitbreaker Realm expert in an instant!

Fear!

Deep fear!

Yang Ye sheathed his sword and gazed at the others while a grin curled up on his face, “Don’t even think of leaving today!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he shot forward while Oxxy swung the Primordial Axe of Creation at the gray robed old man.

Meanwhile, a wisp of ferocity flashed through the old man’s eyes, “Everyone, either he or we will die today. Attack together! I’ll stop this demon!”

As soon as he said that, he charged at Oxxy. During this process, his aura grew stronger and stronger, and in the end, his aura wasn’t in the realm of a One World Realm expert anymore!

A Two World Realm expert!FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

The gray robed old man was no One World Realm expert, he was a Two World Realm expert!

Bang!

An explosion resounded, and then Oxxy was pushed over 1km back!

The other experts grew much more confident from the sight of this!

The gray robed old man gazed at Oxxy with an absolutely ferocious gaze, “No one can save you today, Yang Ye!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he charged at Oxxy again.

At this moment, Oxxy’s viciousness had been aroused. He maintained a low profile in the Primordial Pagoda, but when he was outside, he was a great demon, a true Primal Demon!

Oxxy charged at the old man!

Meanwhile, the other experts charged at Yang Ye.

Yang Ye was about to attack when Snowy appeared on his shoulder, and she was holding the Primal True Dragon that was playing dead!

Snowy glanced at Yang Ye, blinked, and then tossed the Primal True Dragon at Mo Dao’zi’s group!

Mo Dao’zi who was leading the charge had a vicious glow on his face, “What’s that piece of trash?!”

As soon as he said that, he slammed his palm at the Primal True Dragon.

Suddenly, the Primal True Dragon opened its eyes.
