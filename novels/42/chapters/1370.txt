Chapter 1371 – I’ll Kill Them All!

The old man naturally recognized Yang Ye. Yang Ye hadn’t just destroyed the Eye of the Heaven Dao, he’d even killed around a dozen of the old man’s subordinates that day. That incident had made him a joke in the Alliance of Guardians.

After all, Yang Ye had only been a Half-Saint.

But a Half-Saint hadn’t just killed around a dozen of his subordinates, that Half-Saint had actually left safely. Even though the main reason was Lady’s interference, who cared about that? All they knew was that a true Voider like him had actually been unable to kill a Half-Saint!

Now, he hadn’t expected Yang Ye to have returned and even destroyed the Eye of the Heaven Dao within the Radiant Dimension , which he managed. Moreover, Yang Ye had even killed 3 of his subordinates.

Just thinking about that caused a ferocious expression to appear on his face, “Yang Ye, if you hid in the outside world and never came back, then I might really be unable to do anything to you. However, since you’ve come back here to court death, then I’ll fulfil your wish. Let me see who can save you today!”

As soon as he finished speaking, the old man stretched out his palm and slapped it down.

A terrifying energy palm crashed down from the sky. It didn’t just envelop Yang Ye, it even enveloped the entire White Deer Dimension. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Obviously, the old man wanted to destroy White Deer Dimension as well.

Everyone throughout White Deer Dimension shuddered when the energy palm smashed down towards them.

The imposing aura of a true Voider wasn’t something they could resist at all. It was complete superiority, and just that imposing aura could crush them all.

No, Yang Ye was an exclusion!

As he watched the huge palm descend towards him, a fierce smile curled up on his face. A moment later, his figure transformed into a ray of light that shot up into the air. It tore through space and instantly stabbed against the huge palm.

Hiss!

A moment of silence ensued before the huge palm suddenly exploded apart into pieces, and the ray of light didn’t slow down at all as it stabbed at the old man.

The old man’s pupils constricted when the huge palm shattered, and his eyes were filled with shock. He hadn’t expected his attack to be actually destroyed. Even though he hadn’t used his full strength, it wasn’t something an Emperor could destroy.

The old man stopped looking down upon Yang Ye and took a step forward. A terrifying aura swept out from within him, and the space in an area of 3km instantly started to ripple before it.

It was horrifying!

However, it seemed like snow falling into boiling oil when it came into contact with Yang Ye’s attack. The imposing aura was sliced open by the sword energy, and the sword energy didn’t slow down at all as it continued to stab at the old man.

The old man was shocked!

At this moment, he finally realized that he’d severely underestimated Yang Ye’s strength. The man he faced right now wasn’t the same man from that day who couldn’t resist him at all!

The old man took Yang Ye completely seriously now. At the same time, he clenched his fists tightly, shouted with fury, and slammed them forward.

Bang!

The space in an area of 3km around the old man cracked apart and shattered, and then a huge black hole appeared in the sky above White Deer Dimension.

Even though the space there had shattered, the battle hadn’t stopped.

Yang Ye transformed into a ray of light that arrived before the old man, causing the old man’s eyes to narrow slightly. He hadn’t expected Yang Ye to actually not fear being swallowed up by the black hole. But while Yang Ye’s sword had arrived before him, the old man’s face was surprisingly calm.

The old man took a step forward. In an instant, the ray of light that Yang Ye formed had stopped on the spot, and the light dispersed to reveal Yang Ye’s figure.

The Laws of Time!

A wisp of ridicule curled up on the corners of the old man’s mouth, “Yang Ye! It’s over!”

As he spoke, he stretched his hand forward and slapped it at Yang Ye. Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly spoke, “It’s over indeed.”

The old man frowned. Suddenly, a mysterious force appeared here, and then Yang Ye transformed into a ray of light that pierced through the old man’s chest.

The old man’s eyes swiftly opened wide, and there was shock and bewilderment in them, “How... how could this... how could this be possible?”

Hiss!

A ray of light pierced through the back of the old man’s head, and then his voice stopped abruptly.

It was naturally Yang Ye who’d done that. He wasn’t interested in wasting his breath with the old man. He immediately waved his right hand and stored the old man’s corpse within the ancient sheath. A Sword Servant at the True Voider Realm was much stronger than an ordinary Voider, so if he lost one of his Sword Servants in the future or improved his cultivation, then he could refine the old man’s corpse into a Sword Servant.

The battle was over!

Actually, less than 100 breaths of time had passed since the moment Yang Ye and the old man fought, and it was exactly during such a short while that the life of a Voider had been taken. They spectators weren’t aware of Yang Ye’s true strength, and their impression of his strength was still stuck in the past. So, they were naturally extremely shocked when they saw Yang Ye kill a Voider with such ease.

Yang Ye’s figure flashed and arrived by Xiao Bieli’s side. At this moment, he saw a familiar figure by Xiao Bieli’s side. It was Xuwu Shen who’d come with him from Pine Prefecture.

Yang Ye sized him up, and then a trace of surprise flashed through his eyes, “You’re a Quasi Emperor now?”

Xuwu Shen chuckled, “I’m still inferior to you. You’re an Emperor already.”

Yang Ye smiled, “I got some fortuitous encounters!” Indeed, the reason he’d been able to attain the Emperor Realm so quickly had been because of Dark Hell Continent. It was much easier to advance there than the Radiant Dimension.

Xuwu Shen smiled, and then spoke seriously, “What are your plans now?”

Xiao Bieli and Xiao Ling gazed at Yang Ye because they wanted to find out the answer as well.

Yang Ye pondered deeply for a moment, and then he said, “Leave the Radiant Dimension with me!”

He’d thought about this before he came here. The Radiant Dimension was within the Alliance of Guardians’ territory. So, unless he annihilated the Alliance of Guardians, White Deer Academy, the Ancient Sword School in Pine Prefecture, and the other powers linked to him couldn’t stay here at all. Moreover, this was only a small world, so there was no room for them to develop. Thus, he’d decided before he even returned that he would take all of them to Dark Hell Continent.

“Leave the Radiant Dimension?” Xiao Bieli was shocked, “Where will we go?”

“Dark Hell Continent!” As he spoke, he told them about the Sword Alliance and the situation on Dark Hell Continent. When they found out that Yang Ye had created a power and united an entire medium world, Xiao Bieli and the others felt beyond shocked.

A long time passed before Xiao Bieli laughed bitterly, “I never expected you to have grown at such a terrifying pace. In just this short period, you haven’t just improved your strength to a terrifying level, you’ve even developed a power and obtained a medium world.”

Xuwu Shen laughed bitterly as well, “What a blow to my confidence!”

Meanwhile, Xiao Ling suddenly asked, “Kid, once White Deer Academy goes to Dark Hell Continent, will it be joining your Sword Alliance or...?”

Xiao Bieli gazed at Yang Ye as well.

Yang Ye smiled, “The Sword Alliance is the Sword Alliance; White Deer Academy is White Deer Academy. White Deer Academy won’t be a subordinate of my Sword Alliance on Dark Hell Continent. It’s a huge world, and you can recruit students there.”

Saying that meant that he was dividing a part of the continent’s resources to White Deer Academy. However, it was just a small number of resources to him because the Sword Alliance’s goal wasn’t just a single world but countless worlds. Moreover, the White Deer Academy had helped him on numerous occasions, and he owed the academy. So, he was naturally unable to do something like taking advantage of the situation to swallow White Deer Academy.

Xiao Bieli instantly heaved a sigh of relief when he heard Yang Ye. He was quite worried when Xiao Ling asked Yang Ye that question earlier. He was worried that Yang Ye wanted to merge White Deer Academy into the Sword Alliance. He would definitely refuse if that was Yang Ye’s goal. White Deer Academy didn’t just belong to him, and it was an academy that had been passed down for generations. So, merging into the Sword Alliance represented that White Deer Academy would cease to exist.

It wasn’t something he was willing to see happen. He could naturally not allow White Deer Academy’s inheritance to stop with him. Fortunately, Yang Ye hadn’t asked for that, and that made him feel quite warm because Yang Ye hadn’t forgotten the kindness White Deer Academy had shown him.

Xiao Ling nodded slightly and smiled, “At least you have a heart!”

Yang Ye looked up at the sky and said, “Dean Xiao, please send someone to Pine Prefecture. Tell Lu Wan’er from the Ancient Sword School and Yu Wushuang from Ocean of Clouds Academy to immediately stop what they are doing and bring everyone at the Half-Saint Realm or above to White Deer Academy as soon as possible.”

Xiao Bieli asked, “What about the ordinary people?”

Yang Ye shook his head. How many people were there in Ocean of Clouds City and White Deer Dimension? He was naturally unable to take all of them with him. It wasn’t realistic at all. Moreover, those who were too weak were utterly incapable of leaving the Radiant Dimension, and it was impossible even if he tried to use teleportation formations. Because if they were too weak, they wouldn’t be able to endure the teleportation at all.

Xiao Bieli naturally understood that as well. But if we take all the experts with us, how will they survive?

Suddenly, Xiao Ling said, “The Alliance of Guardians is targeting all of us who can pose a threat to them. So long as we leave, the Alliance of Guardians won’t cause trouble for the ordinary cultivators. Conversely, we’ll definitely bring calamity upon them if we continue to stay.”

Xiao Bieli remained silent for a while, and then he nodded, “I’ll go make the preparations right now.”

“Remember to be quick!” said Yang Ye. There was another reason why he was so impatient. It was because of what Nether Maiden had told him earlier. She’d asked him to take them away as soon as possible. While he didn’t know why, he knew that she would definitely not cause harm to him. So, something major might be about to happen in the Radiant Dimension.

Once that occurred, it would definitely be a calamity to these people who were comparatively weaker.

Xiao Bieli nodded, and then he gazed at Xuwu Shen, “Xuwu Shen, you’re from Pine Prefecture/ Go there with Shihe.”

Xuwu Shen nodded, “Alright, I’ll go right away.”

As soon as he finished speaking, his figure vanished into the distance.

Xuwu Shen had just left when space suddenly trembled in the sky.

Yang Ye and the others looked up. A short while passed before Xiao Bieli spoke in a low voice, “They won’t stop.”

Yang Ye flipped his palm and Heaven’s Gravestone appeared in his grasp while he looked at the trembling expanse of space. He spoke indifferently, “It’s fine. I’ll kill all who come here today!”
