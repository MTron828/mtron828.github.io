Chapter 1393 – Battling A Deity!

After retreating a few thousands of kilometers, Yang Ye finally stopped his figure.

A mark created by a finger had been left behind on his chest. Even though the scales there had completely warped, they hadn’t been broken open. Moreover, the mark swiftly vanished as his stellar energy repaired the scales there.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye’s body had merely been shaken slightly and hadn’t suffered any material harm. Actually, this wasn’t just the benefits of the Stellar Ward technique, his own physical strength and defenses had played a huge role as well. If he was an ordinary person, he would have definitely been heavily injured by that attack, even if he had the Stellar Ward technique.

The Stellar Ward technique was very formidable, and it could protect its user from most damage. However, it was impossible for it to protect its user from all damage. For example, that attack Yang Ye had just received from the old man at the Deity Realm. Most of the damage had been resisted by the Stellar Ward technique, but the remaining force was still extremely strong, and that was what had blasted Yang Ye so far away!

If his body wasn’t at the Epoch Realm, then the remaining force might have shattered his body. It was like what had happened to the short man when he fought the pig-riding young woman. His weapon had resisted the force within her attack, but his body hadn’t been able to resist the remaining force that came from the collision!

“What powerful defenses!” The old man’s eyes narrowed slightly, and he sized up Yang Ye, “Stellar energy. You’re actually able to utilize both profound energy and stellar energy. Truly inconceivable.”

Many people in Skyriver Stellar Region had noticed the existence of stellar energy in the past, and some had thought of cultivating with both profound energy and stellar energy. However, that was utterly impossible because they were 2 different types of energy, and they would conflict with each other when within a single body. If one absorbed too much stellar energy, the 2 types of energy wouldn’t just conflict with each other, it was very likely for one’s body to be unable to endure it and explode apart.

There were cases of cultivators in Skyriver Stellar Region that had tried to master both types of energy and exploded in the end. So, he hadn’t expected Yang Ye to actually possess both profound energy and stellar energy at the same time.

Yang Ye moved his gaze away from his chest and gazed at the old man. That old man is probably the Deity from the Alliance of Guardians.

Yang Ye remembered that Fen Cangyan had said that the Alliance of Guardians had another Deity guarding Skyriver Stellar Region, so he felt that the old man should be that Deity.

A Deity is here! Yang Ye couldn’t help but feel slightly worried. He wasn’t worried about himself; he was worried about Blind Maiden. Even though Blind Maiden hadn’t shown herself, he knew that the pressure she was facing was definitely much greater than what he faced. If it was within her ability, she would have definitely not allowed a Deity to come to the Radiant Dimension. Because both he and the others from the Nether Pavilion would find it very strenuous to deal with a Deity.

Yet now, a Deity had arrived here. In other words, Blind Maiden might have her hands full.

Yang Ye’s heart couldn’t help but sink at the thought of that. Because they would be finished if anything happened to Blind Maiden.

Meanwhile, the old man said, “Yang Ye, that woman saved you that day. Now, let me see who’ll save you today.” As soon as he finished speaking, he took a step forward and tapped his finger in Yang Ye’s direction.

Space suddenly rippled like the surface of a lake.

Yang Ye’s expression changed. He took the Sword Precursor in both hands and swung it swiftly.

Bang!

A muffled explosion resounded, and then Yang Ye was blasted around 1km away. Once he stopped his figure, Yang Ye put the Sword Precursor away and exchanged it for Heaven’s Gravestone. The Sword Precursor was clearly stronger than Heaven’s Gravestone, but it had a huge problem. It exhausted too much profound energy. It consumed at least 5 times more profound energy than Heaven’s Gravestone!

So, unless he was executing the true form of Heavenrend, he would practically never utilize the Sword Precursor.

The desire to kill in the old man’s eyes grew even stronger when he saw Yang Ye overcome his attack. A true monstrous genius! Yang Ye was such a person! When it came to people like that, one should either avoid offending them or annihilate them if they’ve been offended. Otherwise, once they matured, the consequences would be absolutely impossible to endure.

The old man pondered deeply for a moment and was about to attack. However, Yang Ye suddenly vanished on the spot, and he was in front of the old man when his figure appeared once more. At the same time, the tip of a sword stabbed towards the center of the old man’s forehead.

A wisp of ridicule arose on the corners of the old man’s mouth. As far as he was concerned, even if Yang Ye was a true monstrous genius, an Emperor like Yang Ye had no right to fight him .

He was a Deity, and Yang Ye was just an Emperor.

The old man didn’t waste his breath and just flipped his right palm slightly, and then he slapped it forward.

Bang!

A wave of terrifying energy surged out from the center of his palm. In just an instant, Yang Ye was blasted around 3km away.

Right when the old man was about to attack again, Yang Ye’s figure suddenly stopped flying backwards, and then the Sword God’s Seal lit up on the center of his forehead. After that, Yang Ye vanished, and he was in front of the old man when his figure appeared once more.

The 3 Mu Sanyuans and the 2 Semi-Deities’ expressions changed drastically at the sight of this, and they shot backwards. Because they’d noticed a detail, and that detail was the blood red sword in Yang Ye’s ancient sheath had been changed while Yang Ye charged at the old man.

Heaven’s Gravestone had been exchanged for the Sword Precursor!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye arrived before the old man. A wisp of ridicule still remained on the corners of the old man’s mouth. He was about to attack when his expression suddenly changed.

Danger!

Extreme danger!

The old man was shocked. Why do I suddenly feel like I’m in extreme danger? Even though he was puzzled, he didn’t act carelessly. A wave of terrifying aura surged out from him and slammed down upon Yang Ye. At the same time, he moved backwards. However, Yang Ye, who’d arrived before him, had swiftly drawn his sword and swung it!

Om!

At the moment this sword howl resounded, the old man’s aura was instantly obliterated. At the same time, a huge expanse of space around them had collapsed in an instant. Besides that, large cracks were appearing through the expanse of space that was even farther away from them, and then numerous pillar-thick spatial rifts started spreading swiftly. It was an absolutely shocking sight.

A few breaths of time later, the sky slowly returned to normal.

At this moment, the old man who had been in front of Yang Ye was 30km away.

The old man stared fixedly at Yang Ye. A short while passed before a wisp of blood seeped out from the corner of his mouth.

Crack!

After that, a clear and resounding crack resounded. Mu Sanyuan and the others watched with astonishment as the old man’s entire face suddenly cracked open. Moreover, the old man’s entire body had cracked open as well. Blood was flowing from him like a fountain, and he was instantly drenched in blood.

But he was still alive!

Even though he was still alive, Mu Sanyuan and the others’ hairs were standing on end.

After all, the old man was a Deity!

A deity!

However, he’d been reduced to such a state. Even though the old man wasn’t dead, he was heavily injured. So, not to mention attacking, the old man probably wouldn’t even dare to utilize his profound energy right now. It could be said that even a strong gale might be able to obliterate him!

He was crippled!

A Deity had been crippled by a single swing of Yang Ye’s sword!

When they thought up to this point, Mu Sanyuan and the others couldn’t help but shiver.

Yang Ye hadn’t chosen to follow up with another attack. Because he was almost crippled as well. The stellar energy he’d absorbed into his body after executing the Stellar Ward technique had been completely exhausted. Actually, he’d exhausted all his stellar energy when he executed Heavenrend twice just now. As for the Heavenrend he’d just executed, he’d used profound energy to execute it because his profound energy had recovered a little.

This was the benefit of being able to possess 2 types of energy. They could supplement each other!

Since the very beginning, he’d executed Heavenrend 5 times!

5 Heavenrends!

He was truly at the end of his strength.

The reason he could still stand now was that the Stellar Ward technique was supporting him up. Once it vanished, he would be finished.

Exhausted!

Severely over-exhausted!

“Kill him!” Suddenly, the old man in linen robs shouted. However, a mouthful of blood instantly sprayed from his mouth once he finished speaking. Moreover, quite a bit of blood seeped out from his cracked face as well.

Mu Sanyuan and the other 2 Semi-Deities exchanged glances, but they didn’t choose to attack.

Meanwhile, the old man spoke in a low voice, “He’s completely exhausted. Kill him quickly. It’s the last chance you’ll have. So long as you kill him, you’ll be able to obtain 10 permits. So, what are you waiting for?”

He wanted to do it himself. However, he didn’t even dare to move a muscle right now.

Yang Ye’s attack had shattered his entire body and internal organs. It could be said that even an ordinary cultivator could kill him right now.

But he knew that Yang Ye was definitely in a similar state right now. Otherwise, Yang Ye would definitely not be standing there.

Now, the only people who could fight were Mu Sanyuan and the others. So, he’d entrusted his hopes to them.

Mu Sanyuan and the others immediately gazed at Yang Ye when they heard the old man. Meanwhile, Yang Ye looked at them as well. His face was calm, and he remained silent. All he did was sheath the Sword Precursor.

Mu Sanyuan and the others’ expressions changed drastically the sight of that. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“What are you afraid of?!” Meanwhile, the old man howled with fury, “He’s just trying to scare all of you! Tell me, if he had the strength to fight, would he just look at me and not try to kill me? Would he? He wouldn’t! But he didn’t try to kill me because he’s heavily injured as well. All of you can definitely kill him with absolute ease!”

Mu Sanyuan and the others exchanged glances, hesitated for a moment, and then they shot towards Yang Ye.

Yang Ye’s eyelids twitched at the sight of this.

Suddenly, a woman appeared in front of Yang Ye. After that, she stretched out her right hand and waved it.

Yang Ye watched with astonishment as a wave of energy rippled forward, and then Mu Sanyuan and the others were instantly obliterated!

It only took an instant!

After that, she turned around to look at Yang Ye.

Yang Ye’s eyes instantly opened wide when he saw her, “You... you are....”

Yang Ye’s eyes were filled with bewilderment, disbelief, and a trace of fear!
