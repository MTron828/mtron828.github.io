Chapter 1177 – My Sword Is Starving!

Numerous arm-thick cracks appeared throughout the sky, and they were spreading rapidly towards the surroundings. In next to no time, the space in an area of over 5km around Yang Ye and the old man in linen robes had cracked apart. At the same time, an extremely powerful aura rained down like a million mountains.

Countless people in the surroundings were horrified, and they retreated towards the surroundings.

The old man’s face had become extremely solemn as well. Even though Yang Ye hadn’t launched the attack, the energy contained within Yang Ye’s fist caused his heart to palpitate.

Is he really a Saint?

The old man didn’t think further. He raised his hands and made a clawing motion. In an instant, the space throughout the sky was repaired in an instant, and then he shouted, “Mince!”

As soon as his voice resounded, the space around Yang Ye instantly started to twist and warp.

The mincing force created in the space around him caused Yang Ye to immediately frown. At the same time, his body had actually started to warp as well!

A ferocious expression appeared on the corners of Yang Ye’s mouth, and he swiftly slammed his right fist forward!

Bang!

A wave of terrifying force surged out like a torrent from Yang Ye’s fist, and the space before him collapsed in an instant.

The others in the surroundings were horrified and fled madly towards the surroundings. They didn’t dare to come close to the area where Yang Ye and the old man were.

A very long time passed before the space in the sky returned to normal, and both Yang Ye and the old man appeared once more before them. At this moment, the old man was very far away from Yang Ye, and there was a wisp of scarlet red on the corner of his mouth.

He’s injured!

Tempestuous waves instantly surged through the hearts of all the spectators. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

It didn’t take long for them to look at Yang Ye. On the contrary, there didn’t seem to be any difference in Yang Ye’s appearance. It seemed like he was completely fine.

The old man lost?

The old man was staring at Yang Ye while blood was still seeping out from the corner of his mouth. Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly started walking towards the old man, and then a pillar of blood shot up into the sky from within him. After that, a blood red sword appeared in Yang Ye’s right grasp before he sheathed it.

A terrifying aura, and monstrous baleful energy and slaughter intent swept through the sky, and even the old man couldn’t help but take a step back!

Yang Ye gazed at the old man while a ferocious smile arose on the corners of his mouth, “This attack of mine once killed an Emperor. Old man, do you want to give it a try?”

The old man stared at Yang Ye as he said, “Good! Very good! I really misjudged you.” As he spoke, blood started flowing incessantly from the corner of his mouth.

Yang Ye asked again, “Are you going to try it or not?”

The old man took a deep and long glance at Yang Ye, and then he transformed into a ray of light that vanished into the horizon.

He’d fled!

The others’ mouths opened wide while they felt completely dazed. Because an Emperor had actually been heavily injured and fled in a battle with a Saint!

If they hadn’t witnessed it with their own eyes, they would have absolutely not believed it!

However, no matter what had happened, this incident could be said to have come to an end for now, at least. They heaved a sigh of relief. However, a few figures suddenly shot out from the gorge in the distance.

It was those experts from Doomsday City!

The black robed man who led the ground glanced at them, and his gaze descended upon Yang Ye in the end. He was slightly stunned when he saw Yang Ye was completely blood red, and he said, “You’re actually still alive!”

Yang Ye gazed at the black robed man and asked, “Do you want me dead that badly?”

The black robed man’s eyes narrowed slightly, “It’s fine. Since you’re alive, I’ll kill you again!”

As soon as he finished speaking, the black robed man was about to attack. However, a ray of blood red light flashed, and then his figure stiffened on the spot while his eyes opened wide. An instant later, his head tilted to the side and rolled off his neck.

Blood shot up like a fountain!

He’d been killed in an instant!

A Quasi Emperor had been killed in an instant!

The remaining experts of Doomsday City were shocked, and they gazed at Yang Ye like he was a monster. Meanwhile, another ray of blood red light flashed, and the head of another Quasi Emperor flew into the air.

This time, the 2 remaining Quasi Emperors from Doomsday City didn’t dare to stay stunned on the spot, and they immediately turned around and vanished into the horizon.

Yang Ye was about to pursue them when Ye Liuyun suddenly appeared in front of him, “Keeping them alive is useful to us. You....”

Ye Liuyun stopped abruptly at this point, and she couldn’t help but take a few steps back. Because Yang Ye’s gaze at her carried terrifying killing intent.

Yang Ye started walking towards Ye Liuyun while his sword trembled!

Ye Liuyun was horrified. Fortunately, a small white head suddenly emerged from Yang Ye’s chest. The small white head glanced at the surroundings, and then stretched out her little claw and tapped Yang Ye’s chest. After that, it returned back into Yang Ye’s chest.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye stopped moving and closed his eyes slowly. A long time passed before the blood red glow started to slowly retract into him.

Around 10 breaths of time later, Yang Ye opened his eyes, and they were clear once more.

Ye Liuyun instantly heaved a sigh of relief at the sight of this. Because she felt like she was about to die just now. Even though she was a Quasi Emperor, she didn’t have even an ounce of confidence to face Yang Ye.

Yang Ye shook his head slightly, and then he glanced at the others, “Everyone, I represent the Sword Alliance in extending a sincere invitation to all of you to join us. Those who are willing will be one of our own from now on. If I, Yang Ye, gain something, all of you will definitely have a share as well. As for those who are unwilling, it’s fine. We’ll just part peacefully!”

All of them fell silent.

Yang Ye’s gaze descended onto Ye Liuyun, “Miss Ye, what do you think?”

Ye Liuyun fell silent for a long time before she said, “I’m willing to join the Sword Alliance!”

Yang Ye’s strength was comparable to an Emperor. Even she refused to believe that such a person didn’t possess the backing of a mysterious power. Presently, all of them were definitely in the Dark Sky Sect’s blacklist. If they didn’t find someone to rely on, then all they could do was flee. Moreover, they had to flee after disbanding their groups. Because it was impossible to flee in a large group as they would be a huge target. Besides that, they would have to go into hiding from now onwards!

She didn’t want to go through such a life!

Yang Ye revealed a slight smile when he heard her agree, and then he waved his right hand. The Fire Dragon Bow instantly appeared before Ye Liuyun, “Miss Ye, I obtained this bow by chance. It should be useful to you.”

A Quasi Emperor Rank bow! Everyone here was visibly moved at the sight of this. It’s a Quasi Emperor Rank treasure! That fellow actually gave it away just like that? Isn’t... isn’t he too generous?

Ye Liuyun was slightly stunned as well. She hadn’t expected Yang Ye to actually give her a Quasi Emperor Rank treasure right away. After all, it was an extremely precious treasure even in large powers! But Yang Ye had given one to her just like that!

Ye Liuyun shot a glance that carried complicated emotions at Yang Ye, and then she put the bow away and said, “If you don’t betray me, then I won’t betray you!”

Yang Ye smiled, “We have a common goal, and that’s to live and live well. Don’t we?”

Ye Liuyun nodded and stood behind Yang Ye. When they saw Ye Liuyun do that, the other members of the Souleater Mercs hurriedly stood over behind Yang Ye as well.

Meanwhile, Elder Mo stepped forward, “My Snow Lion Mercs are willing to join as well!”

Yang Ye gazed at Elder Mo, “Welcome!”

Elder Mo cupped his fists to Yang Ye, and then he led his group over to stand behind Yang Ye.

It didn’t take long for more mercenary groups and independent cultivators to declare their willingness to join the Sword Alliance. In the end, 90% of them joined while the rest left.

They didn’t like being bound to something, or they had other intentions. So, Yang Ye didn’t force them and just let them leave.

Yang Ye glanced at them, and he noticed that 10 of them were Quasi Emperors. 10 Quasi Emperors were clearly too few. After all, the Quasi Emperors here were much more numerous than the Radiant Dimension. Moreover, this world had Emperors. Besides that, he was very well aware that they might not have wholeheartedly joined the Sword Alliance.

At this moment, they actually had no other choice. Because they knew that the Dark Sky Sect would definitely not let them go, but they had nowhere to seek protection from. So, they had no choice but to choose the Sword Alliance.

Yang Ye was very well aware of that, but he didn’t mind. Because while the Sword Alliance had the potential to grow, then he was confident that they would stay wholeheartedly in the future!

He refused to believe that they would be willing to be mercenaries for their entire life!

Meanwhile, Ye Liuyun said, “What’s your plan now?”

Yang Ye gazed at her and replied, “Do you have any suggestions?”

Ye Liuyun pondered deeply for a moment and said, “We need a base right now. There’s a small city around 50,000km from here, Cloudfall City. Because it’s close to the desert, the spirit energy there is very scarce and practically nonexistent. That’s exactly why it’s like a dead city. We have a spirit vein, so we can slowly develop there.”

Yang Ye glanced at her, and then he glanced at the others, “From this moment onward, Miss Ye is our Sword Alliance’s. Hmmm, she’s our Sword Alliance’s Counsellor. Seeing her is like seeing me! If I’m not in the Sword Alliance, then she’ll deal with everything in my place.”

The others were stunned when they heard Yang Ye, and it included Ye Liuyun herself. She hadn’t expected that Yang Ye would suddenly do that. After all, Yang Ye was giving authority away just like that, and it was huge authority!

Meanwhile, a middle aged man by Elder Mo’s side spoke abruptly, “That isn’t fair....”

Suddenly, Yang Ye gazed at him and said, “You seem to have not adjusted yourself to your new identity!”

The middle aged man was stunned.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye glanced at the others and said, “I’ll discuss some things with everyone, but if I’ve decided something, then I hope that no one objects to it. Moreover, I hope that I don’t have to make an example of someone to deter all of you. In the end, I’d like to remind all of you that you belong to the Sword Alliance now. Don’t bring your habits of scheming and conspiring against each other into my Sword Alliance. Otherwise, I’ll kill every single one of you who does that!”

All of them were visibly shocked, and then they fell silent.

Yang Ye gazed at Ye Liuyun, “Set out for Cloudfall City.”

Ye Liuyun said, “I have one more question!”

Yang Ye replied, “Go on!”

Ye Liuyun spoke softly, “Doomsday City and the Dark Sky Sect....”

Yang Ye waved his hand and said, “We’re in a hopeless situation right now. All we can do is seek to survive it. So, don’t think too much about that. If they come, then we’ll kill them, and we’ll kill them until they dare not show themselves again! It’s just that simple!”

Suddenly, numerous terrifying auras came from afar. They turned around and looked towards the source of it, and they saw a few dozen figures appear on the horizon.

All of them were Quasi Emperors!

Ye Liuyun spoke solemnly, “It’s the experts of Doomsday City!”

Many of the people here had instantly turned ghastly pale.

“All of you leave first!” As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye turned around and started walking towards the group of Quasi Emperors.

Nan Shuang hurriedly shouted at him, “Where are you going?”

Yang Ye’s voice resounded from afar, “To kill! My sword is starving!”

Nan Shuang shouted again, “There are so many of them!”

Yang Ye’s voice resounded once more from afar, “Only then can I kill to my heart’s content!”

The others felt speechless when they heard him.
