Chapter 2464 – Kill! Kill!

When she saw the look on the Martial Qilin’s face, Erya realized what was wrong. She thought for a moment and said, “Get some metal and make one yourself!”

Make one itself!

The Martial Qilin nodded because that could be done!

It turned around and left.

A short while later, a huge pot that was larger than a house appeared on the Ascension Platform!

A huge iron pot to stew the black dragon!

Just like that, the black dragon was cut apart under Erya’s command and placed in the pot.

They started cooking it!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye was still fighting Di Lian outside the pagoda!

At this moment, they were equally matched!

He grew stronger as the battle progressed!

At this point in the battle, Di Lian actually had the intent to retreat.

There was no irreconcilable enmity between Yang Ye and the Di Clan. Even if the Di Clan could kill Yang Ye, it would have to pay a terrible price to succeed. The Di Clan had existed for thousands of years, and it naturally had many more trump cards!

However, Di Lian didn’t want to use them!

Those trump cards were being kept for the battle with the desolate race and Eternal Kingdom. That battle was critical to the Di Clan.

Moreover, the Di Clan had trump cards, but did Yang Ye have none? Not to mention anything else, just that young girl from before instilled quite a bit of fear in Di Lian!

He knew the dragon’s strength very well. It was a Primal Demon that had cultivated for over 10,000 years. It was merely inferior to a Primal True Dragon in the Dragon Clan, but that black dragon had been beaten to death by the young girl!

While he didn’t know anything about her origins, he knew that she was no human!

A mysterious demon beast!

Di Lian had the intent to retreat, but Yang Ye was in such a state, and it was a state where he was impossible to reach! Moreover, Yang Ye was growing stronger as the battle progressed!

Bang! Bang! Bang!

Explosions resounded incessantly in the air above the city.

As time trickled by, Di Lian was being suppressed by Yang Ye instead. It was because Yang Ye’s sword had grown faster and stronger!

“Raise the formation!” Suddenly, Di Lian’s voice resounded.

As soon as he gave the order, a beam of light shot up into the air from deep beneath the ground and slammed against Yang Ye.

Bang!

Yang Ye was blasted over 3km away!

He was pushed all the way out of the city.

Meanwhile, a huge barrier of light appeared around the city. It completely enveloped the city. At the same time, a white vortex of light appeared in the air above the city and rays of terrifying aura rippled out from within it.

In the air above the city, Di Lian gazed coldly at Yang Ye, “Attack!”

As soon as he gave the command, the white vortex suddenly started spinning, and then numerous beams of light that carried terrifying energy within them shot out like arcs of lightning from within the vortex.

They were extremely fast!

Yang Ye swung both his swords!

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!

Every single swing of his swords would slice apart a beam of light, but there were too, too many of them. Moreover, the energy they contained was too, too powerful! If this continued, he would be exhausted to death!

Suddenly, the Sword Gourd trembled on Yang Ye’s waist, and then a ray of light tore through the sky and stabbed the white vortex of light.

Boom!

It obliterated the white vortex of light!

Executor!

Yang Ye hadn’t been using it earlier!

Battle!

As Sword Scroll had mentioned in the past, he needed to fight like a madman to fully awaken his bloodline! Ordinary Four World Realm experts were entirely incapable of making him enter a mad state. Now that he’d finally encountered an expert like Di Lian who could suppress him, he naturally refused to give up on such an opportunity. Thus, he hadn’t chosen to use Executor!

However, Di Lian refused to fight him in single combat and tried to use a formation!

At this moment, Yang Ye instinctively used Executor!

Just one attack and the formation was destroyed!

In the sky above the city, Di Lian’s face fell!

The number one sword of Eternal Kingdom! He naturally recognized it!

Once he destroyed the formation, Yang Ye charged at Di Lian again!

As soon as he arrived above Di Lian, his swords descended!

Five swings with the Sword Domain!

He was being serious now!

Di Lian’s eyes narrowed slightly. He squatted down slightly and formed a strange seal with both hands, and then a peerlessly powerful aura suddenly rippled out from him!

As Yang Ye’s swords descended, Di Lan raised his palms! The powerful aura they emanated immediately gained a target and surged up into the air!

Boom!

An explosion rumbled through the sky above the city.

Both of them split up!

Yang Ye returned to where he’d been a while ago, and Di Lian moved around 300m back! As soon as he stopped himself, a flying sword soundlessly arrived before him!

A flying sword!

Di Lian’s eyes narrowed slightly and he pressed his palms together!

Yang Ye’s flying sword was instantly clamped between his palms, but the powerful force they carried pushed Di Lian backward repeatedly!

Suddenly, Di Lian released his grip and moved his head slightly to the side!

Hiss!

The flying sword passed right by his face!

The flying sword curved in an arc and shot back at him. But this time, the force it contained was much inferior than it had previously been!

Di Lian slammed a punch forward, and the powerful impact from it forced the sword to a stop!

But right at this moment, Yang Ye suddenly appeared behind him, and then two swords slashed down!

Di Lian’s eyes narrowed slightly. He twisted his right foot against the ground and stomped it down.

Bang!

A wave of powerful energy rippled out with him at its center! The energy forcefully pushed Yang Ye back, but at the instant that happened, a flying sword appeared before Di Lian’s forehead!

It would have stabbed into his forehead if it moved just half an inch forward!

Di Lian had clamped the sword again with both palms!

But right at this moment, Yang Ye suddenly appeared behind Executor, and then he grabbed it with his right hand and twisted.

Hiss!Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

A pair of palms flew up into the air while Di Lian himself was instantly blasted over 3km away by the energy unleashed by Executor!

He’d taken Di Lian’s palms!

Di Lian stared indifferently at Yang Ye from afar!

Yang Ye was about to continue when a voice suddenly resounded from behind him, “Brother Yang, please show mercy!”

Yang Ye ignored the voice and just charged at Di Lian!

The voice resounded again, “Miss An, please show yourself!”

An Nanjing appeared before Yang Ye, and Yang Ye swung his sword at her. But she didn’t counterattack and just gazed at Yang Ye!

The sword didn’t descend completely in the end!

It stopped just around 10 centimeters away from her head!

The madness intent around Yang Ye gradually surged back into his body, and the blood vessels beneath his skin gradually returned to normal.

Yang Ye closed his eyes slowly, and a long time passed before he turned around. Huang Ying was standing in front of him.

Huang Ying smiled, “Congratulations, your strength has improved quite a bit, Brother Yang! Anyway, can you let me say a few words?”

Yang Ye said, “Go on!”

Huang Ying smiled, “Your objective is the Creation Sect and Immortality Sect, right?”

Yang Ye nodded, “Yes. But I don’t mind adding the Di Clan to my list!”

Di Lian’s face remained indifferent when he heard Yang Ye.

Huang Ying shook his head and smiled, and then he gazed at Di Lian, “Senior, there’s no irreconcilable enmity between your clan and Yang Ye. But it’s different for the Creation Sect and Immortality Sect. They tried to hunt and kill Brother Yang on many occasions in the past, so can you make them show themselves and let them resolve their issues on their own?”

Di Lian glanced at Huang Ying, “They’re subordinates of my Di Clan now!”

Huang Ying smiled, “Senior, I know the Di Clan has many trump cards, and I know you have many trump cards. But while the Di Clan has some, do you think Yang Ye doesn’t? Not to mention anything else, just that young girl and Miss An are enough to give your Di Clan a huge headache, right?”

Miss An!

Di Lian glanced at An Nanjing. Just as Huang Ying had said, she felt very dangerous to him, even more dangerous than Yang Ye!

The young girl from before was another problem. Her physical strength was even more terrifying than a dragon! So it made him wonder what exactly her origins were!

Meanwhile, Huang Ying added, “Senior Di Lian, my desolate race and your clan are working together, so to be honest, my desolate race doesn’t hope to see your clan get into serious trouble. Of course, we don’t want Yang Ye to get into serious trouble either, so I came here personally!”

Di Lian looked Huang Ying in the eyes, “Which side is your desolate race taking?”

Huang Ying smiled, “Neither! But…” He shook his head and smiled at this point, “If it’s my own personal opinion, then I would take Brother Yang’s side.”

Di Liang’s eyes narrowed.

It was quite a tactful reply!

Everyone knew that Huang Ying was the desolate race’s Crown Prince! If he took Yang Ye’s side, didn’t it represent that the desolate race was taking Yang Ye’s side?

The desolate race was taking Yang Ye’s side!

Di Lian would naturally not think that Huang Ying was being impulsive! The desolate race had chosen Yang Ye instead of the Di Clan. Obviously, they looked more favorably upon him! Why did they think that? Moreover, why did the desolate race give up on taking the Sprite Progenitor in Yang Ye’s possession? Even if Yang Ye and Huang Ying were friends, it wouldn’t be enough to stop the desolate race!

It was a Sprite Progenitor!

After thinking about it for a long time, Di Lian glanced at Yang Ye, “My Di Clan has lost this battle. I’ve kicked out the Creation Sect and Immortality Sect from the Emperor World!”

He turned around and vanished on the spot.

The Di Clan had admitted defeat!

Huang Ying gazed at Yang Ye, “You don’t blame me for this, right?”

Yang Ye shook his head. He naturally wouldn’t blame Huang Ying because he’d never planned on fighting the Di Clan to the death!

Huang Ying spoke softly, “While the Di Clan is inferior to my desolate race and Eternal Kingdom, they aren’t ordinary. If worse comes to worse, once Di Lian stops suppressing his cultivation, you will only have a 30% chance to defeat him, and he isn’t the only Five World Realm expert in the Di Clan. Besides that, the patriarch of the Di Clan from all those years ago is still alive. He didn’t show himself, but if he did, this incident would have become even more difficult to deal with! My ancestor the Desolate Emperor once fought with that ancestor of the Di Clan!”

He gazed at Yang Ye and continued, “Besides that, the Di Clan has some other old experts who survived from all those years ago. Once the Di Clan is in danger of being annihilated, all of them will show themselves. And once you drive them into a corner, your strength isn’t enough to resist them at all!”

Yang Ye nodded and glanced at the city, “When will the war begin?”

He was naturally speaking about the war between the desolate race and Eternal Kingdom!

Huang Ying smiled, “Soon!”

Yang Ye nodded slightly, turned around, and left!

Huang Ying asked, “Where are you going?”

“To kill!”

Yang Ye didn’t even shoot a glance back at him!
