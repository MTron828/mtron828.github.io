Chapter 596 – Rend!

Bang!

The Dao Artifact exploded into pieces!

A strand of sword energy shot into the sky, and then it slashed forcefully against that enormous palm.

Bang!

An enormous and shocking explosion resounded through the sky. Lan Yun and Lan Ling watched with astonishment as the enormous palm created by a Monarch Realm expert shook slightly before it exploded apart. Countless bits of energy erupted like fireworks in the air, and it was an extremely shocking scene!

Lan Yun and Lan Ling were astounded to the extreme upon witnessing such a scene. Yang Ye’s strength is actually sufficient to go against a Monarch Realm expert on his own?

“Hmm?” An exclaim resounded from the horizon, and then an old man appeared before Yang Ye. The old man gazed at Yang Ye and said, “I never expected that such a genius like you actually exists on Profounder Continent. You actually possess such strength while merely at the sixth rank of the Exalt Realm. The natural talent and strength you possess would allow you to be ranked in the top 20 even within my Hallowed Grounds. Unfortunately, those who kill members of my Hallowed Grounds must die!”

The old man was about to attack when Elder Mu suddenly appeared in front of Yang Ye, and then the walking stick in Elder Mu’s hand shot forward like a bolt of lightning. That old man from the Hallowed Grounds was horrified, and he cried out involuntarily, “A Half-Saint....”

He hadn’t even been able to finish speaking when the walking stuck pierced through his chest.

Pu!

A mouthful of blood sprayed from the old man’s mouth while his figure was blasted 3km away.

“I’ve spared you because I want you to take a message back to the Hallowed Grounds. If the Hallowed Grounds dares to send Monarch Realm experts to act against him in the future, then I’ll kill every single one of them,” said Elder Mu.

“You....” The old man was about to say something when Elder Mu spoke once more, “You don’t have to leave anymore if you stay a moment longer!”

The old man didn’t dare speak another word when he heard this, and he turned around, split space apart, and vanished on the spot.

Elder Mu turned around to gaze at Yang Ye, and then he nodded, “Not bad. You’ve grown much faster than I expected, and you’re much stronger as well. Even the Founding Ancestor of the Sword Sect wasn’t able to go against a Monarch Realm expert while at the sixth rank of the Exalt Realm. However, it’s still insufficient. The Hallowed Grounds won’t be willing to give up, and the Exalted Han Empire won’t be willing to give up as well. If they make another move, then it wouldn’t be a move against you but me. So, you must attain the Monarch Realm as soon as possible!”

Yang Ye nodded and asked, “Elder Mu, do you know about the Hallowed Grounds?”

Elder Mu nodded lightly and said, “I know a little. You know the Sword Sect’s Founding Ancestor, right? Even he had to fear the Hallowed Grounds while he possessed such invincible strength all those years ago. So, you have to work hard on improving your strength if you don’t want to die. Otherwise, I won’t be able to protect you.”

Yang Ye’s face became serious while the contempt towards the Hallowed Grounds within his heart had vanished. How terrifying was the Sword Sect’s Founding Ancestor all those years ago? However, even he was afraid of the Hallowed Grounds. So, what qualifications did he who was only at the Exalt Realm have to look down upon the Hallowed Grounds?

Presently, there are no Monarch Realm experts acting against me, and I really face no threat at the Exalt Realm. But what would I do if this rule and agreement were to vanish one day?

However, Yang Ye was very clearly aware that he couldn’t be impatient when it came to such things. He needed time now, a huge amount of time!

“Luo Jun might launch a large-scale attack soon, so be careful!” Elder Mu vanished on the spot after he finished speaking.

“Your master is right; you should be careful!” Meanwhile, Corpse Ancestor spoke abruptly, “The Hallowed Grounds had once descended to the continent to kill numerous experts during the ancient times. Most of those experts are dead, but many utilized all sorts of special methods to preserve their lives, and they are waiting to be revived. Just like me. I utilized a secret technique to preserve my consciousness and skeleton!”

Yang Ye frowned. Just Corpse Ancestor’s strength is already so terrifying. If they summon even more, then wouldn’t they even be able to slaughter a Monarch Realm expert? Yang Ye pondered deeply for a moment before he said, “Since you lived through the ancient times and should know how to revive them, then can we revive those fellows before the enemy can?”

Corpse Ancestor shook his head and said, “There was an extraordinary clan on the continent during that time, and it was called the Zhuge Clan. That clan possessed a divine technique called Seven Star Preservation, and we were only able to survive for over 10,000 years by relying on that divine technique combined with our own secret techniques. So, we can only be revived with the secret technique that belongs to the Zhuge Clan. However, there’s a huge price to pay in order to revive us. For example, the blood and resentment of a few million had been utilized that day to revive me!”

Yang Ye’s eyelids twitched as he said, “Luo Jun is the Mortal Emperor. Would he dare to do that?”

“How would he deal with you if he doesn’t?” Corpse Ancestor said, “Presently, even Monarch Realm experts wouldn’t be able to kill you with ease. So, he has no choice but to summon those old fellows in order to deal with you. I have to warn you not to underestimate those old fellows. Perhaps their natural talent and potential are inferior to you, but they’re old geezers who have cultivated for a few hundred or even over a thousand years. Their strengths are definitely superior to you.”

Yang Ye nodded and said, “Don’t worry, I won’t underestimate any opponent of mine!”

“Even if the Exalted Han Empire doesn’t kill you, my Hallowed Grounds will!” Meanwhile, Lan Yun suddenly said, “Don’t think that we’ll be helpless against you because you have a Half-Saint as your master. The strength and reserves of my Hallowed Grounds far exceed your imagination!”

“Since all of you are so formidable, then why seek help from Profounder Continent?” Yang Ye spoke indifferently.

“We’re protecting this continent of yours, so shouldn’t all of you do your part?” Lan Yun spoke in a low voice.

Yang Ye laughed with ridicule and said, “Stop joking. All I see from your attitude is the disdain all of you have for this world of ours. So, would all of you even fight to the death to protect us from the defiant profounders? Perhaps your ancestors from 10,000 years ago might have done so, but I don’t believe it’s the same now.”

“My Hallowed Grounds would be in danger if the defiant profounders are to emerge into the world, but could it be that your Profounder Continent wouldn’t be in danger?” said Lan Yun.

“We’ll deal with them ourselves once they come to Profounder Continent. We don’t need your help!” said Yang Ye.

“How arrogant!” Lan Yun’s eyes were filled with deep disdain as she said, “The ignorant really are fearless. The strength and reserves of my Hallowed Grounds are that formidable, yet we’re still extremely afraid of the defiant profounders and don’t dare to go against them with just the strength of our Hallowed Grounds. Who the heck do you think you are?”

Yang Ye shook his head and said, “You people from the Hallowed Grounds really lack awareness. You shouldn’t be worried about whether I can resist the Hallowed Grounds and the defiant profounders, you should be worried about your younger sister and yourself. Don’t say something stupid like I wouldn’t dare to kill the two of you because I don’t want to waste my breath on you as well. Give me that divine technique, Critical Strike, and the secret technique you utilized to improve your strength, and I’ll give both of you a swift death. Otherwise, you’ll probably be unable to die in peace!”

Yang Ye had thought of refining her into a Sword Servant and extracting her memories, but it was flawed because the memories he obtained wouldn’t be complete, and it was even to the extent that he might fail to extract her memories. Those techniques were very important to him, so he didn’t dare to risk it!

Lan Yun stared fixedly at Yang Ye in silence. Obviously, she intended to resist until the end!

Yang Ye nodded and said, “I understand.” As he spoke, Yang Ye glanced at Lan Ling, and then he spoke indifferently, “Strip her and toss her into the Darkbeast army. They can ultimately decide her fate!”

Lan Ling’s face instantly turned ghastly pale, and she gazed at Yang Ye with horror!

“Don’t you dare!” Lan Yun was exasperated.

“Do it!” Yang Ye spoke indifferently. He refused to show any pity to his enemies because he was clearly aware that they would definitely show no mercy when they slaughtered his loved ones if they were able to kill him.

“Hehehe....” Corpse Ancestor laughed gloomily as he shot explosively towards Lan Ling.

“I’ll do it!” Right at this moment, Lan Yun spoke abruptly. For the very first time, there was fear in her eyes as she gazed at Yang Ye because she felt that this fellow before her wasn’t like a profounder of Profounder Continent at all, and he seemed like a defiant profounder instead.... After all, those fellows were completely fearless as well, and they dared to do anything and everything!

Yang Ye stopped Corpse Ancestor and said, “Go on!”

She took a deep breath and said, “I have a request, otherwise you won’t be able to obtain Critical Strike and that secret technique even if I die!”

“It’s absolutely impossible if you want me to spare you!” said Yang Ye.

Lan Yun said, “Let my younger sister go. She’s utterly incapable of being a threat to you with the strength she possesses. That’s my only condition, and I’m willing to detonate my Dantian if you refuse.”

Lan Ling spoke abruptly, “Big Sister, if we’re going to leave then we’ll leave together!”

Lan Yun suddenly shouted, “Shut your mouth!”

Lan Ling was clearly quite afraid of Lan Yun, and she instantly didn’t dare speak another word and just cried incessantly.

“Don’t be like that!” Yang Ye said, “You make it seem like I’m a wicked person. Please, it was all of you who came to kill me, alright?”

Lan Yun said, “That’s my only condition. I’ll give you both those techniques if you agree. As for myself, I know that you’ll never let me live after I fell into your hands!”

“Smart!” Yang Ye smiled, and then he gazed at Lan Ling and said, “You may leave. Don’t fall into my hands again, unless you have another older sister to save you. Besides that, don’t try to curse me or speak of revenge because that will only kill you right now. Understand?”

Lan Ling lowered her head and concealed the emotions in her eyes from Yang Ye, and then she fell silent for a moment before she turned around and left.

Yang Ye said after Lan Ling’s figure vanished, “Go on. Don’t try to play tricks with me because I guarantee that I’ll be able to determine if you’re telling the truth. Besides that, don’t try to detonate yourself as well because I guarantee that I’ll definitely kill you sister one day if you dare to do that. Don’t look at me like that. Trust me, you’ll regret going back on your word.”

Lan Ling gazed at Yang Ye for a short while, and then the profound energy within her which had just started surging had calmed down slowly.
