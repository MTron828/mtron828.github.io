Chapter 1807 – Join Me!

Book 15 — Heaven Pillar Mountain

Heaven Pillar Mountain!

Yang Ye wasn’t surprised that they were here for him.

Nether Maiden asked, “They are able to find this place?”

Yang Lianshuang shook her head slightly, “They won’t be able to in a short while, but based on their strength, so long as they’re willing to spend some time, then it won’t be difficult for them to find us.”

She gazed at Yang Ye and continued, “What do you plan to do?”

Yang Ye fell silent for a moment and replied, “Head to Heaven Pillar Mountain!”

Yang Lianshuang replied, “If you go now, you’ll be like a lamb entering a pack of wolves. Of course, you have to go there, but I suggest that you stay away for now and wait a little while before going there.”

Yang Ye shook his head, “If I stay here, there’ll be endless problems for everyone here. So long as I’m in Heaven Pillar Mountain, they won’t come looking for trouble with the Yang Clan.”

Yang Lianshuang fell silent for a long time before she said, “I’ll go with you.”

Yang Ye replied, “You should stay. The Yang Clan still needs someone to lead it.”

Yang Lianshuang shook her head, “The Yang Clan doesn’t need a leader, it needs time to rest and recuperate. I’ve made plans for the Yang Clan’s future, and they only have to act according to my plan. Moreover, Zhuang Weiran, Su Qingshi, and the others are here, so nothing will happen to the Yang Clan!”

She paused for a moment and gazed at Yang Ye, “You’re not taking all of them with you, right?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “Of course not!”

He wasn’t going to Heaven Pillar Mountain to have fun. So, if he brought them with him and something happened to him, then everyone would be finished.

Yang Lianshuang nodded, “When are you leaving?”

Yang Ye fell silent for a moment and replied, “In two days!”

In the next two days, Yang Ye didn’t do anything and just accompanied Su Qingshi and the others.

After two days had passed, he left the city with Yang Lianshuang, Nether Maiden, and the others from the Nether Pavilion.

Outside the city, a group of women stood at the entrance of the city. It was Su Qingshi and the others.

Yang Nianxue stood in front of Su Qingshi and looked up at her, “Mommy, when will Daddy come back?”

Su Qingshi looked down at her, and a wisp of tender affection flashed through her eyes. She rubbed Yang Nianxue’s head gently and said, “Daddy will be back once you grow a little more.”

Yang Nianxue blinked, “Really?”

Su Qingshi nodded, “Of course!”

Yang Nianxue clapped, “Then I’m going to grow quickly!” As she said, she took Lei Lin’s hand, and then they started hopping off into the city.

Meanwhile, Qin Xiyue suddenly said, “I want to return to Merak System!”

Su Qingshi looked up into the sky for a long time, and then she said, “He said that once he sends that little girl back, gives that treasure back, and puts an end to the strings of karma that tie them together, then he’ll take us back to Merak System to live in seclusion.”

Qin Xiyue shook her head slightly, “It won’t be that easy….”

Su Qingshi fell silent for a few moments, and then she replied, “I think so too!”

…

Around four hours later, the news that Yang Ye had gone to Heaven Pillar Mountain spread throughout the medium universe. Or to be more precise, it was news that Yang Ye had shown himself, and he was heading in the direction of Heaven Pillar Mountain. Once they received this news, the experts from Heaven Pillar Mountain immediately pursued Yang Ye.

In the boundless starry sky, Yang Ye’s group was moving swiftly through it.

Yang Ye asked, “Second Sister and Third Sister are in Heaven Pillar Mountain?”

Nether Maiden nodded.

Yang Ye asked, “Why didn’t they come here?”

Nether Maiden replied, “Eldest Sister is advancing. So, they can’t leave her side.”

Yang Ye asked, “Advancing? Which stage of the True Realm?”

Nether Maiden shook her head slightly, “It’s not an advancement in cultivation, it’s an advancement in her physique. Her physique is gradually undergoing a transformation, and this advancement is critical for her.”

Yin’yin! Yang Ye fell silent. Nether Maiden’s eldest sister, Sky Maiden, was Yin’yin, of course. Unfortunately, she wasn’t just Yin’yin.

Suddenly, Boundary Maiden, who was at the front of the group, stopped abruptly.

Everyone gazed at her.

Yang Ye asked, “What’s wrong?”

She glanced at the surroundings and said, “We’ve entered into a boundary formation.”

A boundary formation! All of them were stunned. They glanced at the surroundings but noticed nothing.

Meanwhile, Boundary Maiden tapped her finger forward, and then the space in a huge area around them shook violently. After that, a shocking scene appeared. Numerous dark blue threads suddenly appeared around 30km away from them, and the threads seemed to form a square which they just happened to be at the center of.

They’d been locked inside!

“I’m quite surprised!” Suddenly, a voice resounded. It didn’t take long for a black robed old woman to appear not too far away from them. Her face was covered in wrinkles while a nauseating, yet mysterious aura lingered around her.

A 6th stage True Realm expert!

Her gaze descended onto Boundary Maiden, “I never expected my boundary formation to be detected by a little girl at the 1st stage of the True Realm. How surprising!”

Meanwhile, Yang Lianshuang suddenly asked, “You’re from Heaven Pillar Mountain?”

The old woman nodded and gazed at Yang Ye, “You’re that fellow, Yang Ye, right?”

Yang Ye nodded, “I am!”

The old woman sized him up and said, “You’re a monstrous genius indeed. I don’t want to waste my breath. Are you going to hand over that wooden sword, or shall I take it myself?”

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings and asked, “You came alone?”

The old woman asked, “What? I’m not enough?”

Yang Ye chuckled, “You really are alone.” His expression suddenly became ferocious at this point, “How dare you come here by yourself?!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he stomped his right foot down.

Om!

A sword howl resounded, and then a ray of light flashed.

The old woman’s eyes narrowed slightly while the ghastly desire to kill flickered in her eyes. Obviously, Yang Ye’s actions had infuriated her. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

A moment later, a wave of powerful aura swept out from her. It forced Yang Ye to a stop, but it only took a moment for Yang Ye to spin his sword.

Hiss!

The aura was sliced into two. However, she’d vanished on the spot, so Yang Ye’s attack hit nothing but air.

After he missed, Yang Ye swiftly turned around and swung his sword.

Bang!

An explosion resounded, and Yang Ye was blasted 300m away.

The old woman glanced at her palm as she stood not too far away from Yang Ye. There was an extremely striking bloody mark there. She fell silent for an instant, and then she looked up at Yang Ye, “No wonder even the Undertaker died at your hands. You do have some ability. However, I’m not the Undertaker. I….”

The old woman stopped abruptly.

Because Yang Ye had arrived before her, and so did his sword.

A vicious glow flashed through her eyes. She stretched out her right hand and twisted it. In an instant, Yang Ye felt like the world was spinning.

Suddenly, Yang Ye’s expression changed drastically, and then a faint golden light appeared on him.

As soon as the golden light appeared…

Hiss!

An ear piercing sound of cutting resounded, and then Yang Ye was blasted over 1km away.

Once he stopped himself, Yang Ye touched his throat. There was a faint blood red mark there.

At this moment, there was a wisp of solemness in Yang Ye’s eyes.

If he hadn’t activated the Peerless Hegemon state in that instant, his head might have been chopped off.

The old woman was extremely strong!

Meanwhile, she gazed at Yang Ye with a little bit of seriousness in her eyes as well, “I didn’t expect your body to be this strong. But let me see how many attacks it can resist!”

As soon as she finished speaking, her figure shook, and she was in front of Yang Ye when she appeared again. A moment later, a speck of cold light shot towards Yang Ye’s forehead.

Yang Ye would never just use his body to resist it. He twisted his right foot on the ground and drifted around 30m to the left. But just a moment later, he turned around and swung his sword.

Bang!

The space in front of Yang Ye was instantly sliced apart. In an instant, both of them resided within a black hole. Rays of sword energy crisscrossed through the black hole, and explosions resounded incessantly.

The old woman was much stronger than the Undertaker.

Rumble!

Suddenly, the black hole shook violently, and rumbling resounded incessantly from within it.

A trace of worry appeared in the eyes of Yang Lianshuang and the others.

Even though they knew that Yang Ye’s strength had improved quite a bit, it was still an old geezer from Heaven Pillar Mountain. So, her strength wasn’t something that ordinary 6th stage True Realm experts could compare to.

Boom!

Suddenly, a loud explosion resounded, and then two figures flew out from the black hole.

After they flew out of it, the expanse of space returned to normal.

It only took a moment for Yang Ye and the old woman’s figure to appear clearly before them.

At this moment, there was blood on the corner of Yang Ye’s mouth. It wasn’t just on the corner of his mouth, there were numerous strange injuries throughout his body. The old woman had many injuries on her body as well.

The old woman’s face was extremely unsightly. She’d thought that she would be able to kill Yang Ye quickly, but she hadn’t expected him to fight her equally.

She knew she couldn’t delay any longer!

It was because she wasn’t the only one looking for Yang Ye. She had a special technique that allowed her to find Yang Ye, but it wouldn’t take long for the others to find Yang Ye as well!

At that time, she would be in trouble.

She fell silent for a moment, and then she waved her right hand. A strange beast instantly appeared by her side. The beast looked ferocious. It had the body of a lion, and it emanated a horrifyingly violent and vicious aura.

“Kill!” As soon as she gave the order, the beast charged at Yang Ye, and she charged along with it.

“Bullying me with numbers?” Yang Ye was stunned, and then he gazed at Yang Lianshuang and the others, “What are all of you standing there for? Join me!”

All of them felt speechless when they heard this.
