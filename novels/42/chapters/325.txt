Chapter 326 – Mu Jun!

“It’s Mu Jun!” Meanwhile, Xiao Yuxi’s expression turned solemn when she heard the roaring laughter from within the palace.

“You know him?” asked Yang Ye.

She nodded and said, “He’s the Crown Prince of Exalted Han Empire in the central territory. Perhaps you haven’t heard of it. Let me explain it in this way, the forces of the Exalted Han Empire aren’t inferior to a Ninth Rank Sect or Hidden Clan. Because since the continent was split apart. No, I should say that it existed since before the continent was split apart! The history of its existence is even older than any Ninth Rank Sect!”

“Which one is stronger when compared to the southern territory’s Grand Qin Empire?” asked Yang Ye in a low voice.

“They can’t be compared at all!” Xiao Yuxi shook her head and said, “Do you know? There’s an army of 100,000 in the central territory, and they are called Souleater. Even the Ninth Rank Sects and Hidden Clans are extremely fearful of this army because every single member of the army is at least at the Spirit Realm!”

Yang Ye exclaimed. “100,000 Spirit Realm troops?”

Xiao Yuxi nodded and said, “That’s merely its strength that’s revealed on the surface, and its hidden forces are probably even more shocking!” ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Yang Ye shook his head and laughed bitterly. 100,000 troops are merely their forces on the surface. Exactly how strong is the Exalted Han Empire?

Meanwhile, she suddenly said, “Something worthy of mentioning is that the Sword Sect’s Founding Ancestor had once entered into conflict with the Exalted Han Empire 10,000 years ago!”

“What happened?” Yang Ye was instantly interested because a conflict between the number one expert on the continent and the Exalted Han Empire was absolutely a brilliant story!

Xiao Yuxi glanced at him and said, “The Sword Sect’s Founding Ancestor fought his way to the throne room of the palace with just his sword in hand, and the Exalted Han Empire was utterly embarrassed. In the end, it had no choice but to activate its defensive grand formation. However, the formation was still destroyed by the Sword Sect’s Founding Ancestor. So, three Supreme Elders of the Exalted Han Empire who were living in seclusion had no choice but to emerge once more into the world!”

“What happened after that?” Yang Ye pursued an answer impatiently.

“Then Sword Sect’s Founding Ancestor retreated!” said Xiao Yuxi.

“He lost?” Yang Ye was astounded.

She shook her head and said, “No, but he didn’t win as well. Because those three Supreme Elders gathered the Faith Energy of the entire empire to resist the Sword Sect’s Founding Ancestor. The strength of an entire empire coupled with almost 100 Monarch Realm experts and 3 Saint Realm experts.... Even the Sword Sect’s Founding Ancestor who was invincible throughout the world could only retreat temporarily! However, he’d still killed a Supreme Elder and the Emperor of the Exalted Han Empire before he retreated!”

“100 Monarch Realm experts and 3 Saint Realm experts....” Yang Ye gulped down a mouthful of saliva. Aren’t such resources and reserves a little too terrifying!?

Xiao Yuxi nodded and said, “It was also that battle which allowed the world to witness how terrifying the Exalted Han Empire was! Besides the Spatial Mink Clan, only the Exalted Han Empire is capable of forcing the Sword Sect’s Founding Ancestor to retreat!”

Exactly how strong was the Sword Sect’s Founding Ancestor all those years ago? A wisp of a ruthless expression flashed in Yang Ye’s eyes. If I possessed strength like his, then would my mother be imprisoned and suffering in the Flower Palace? If I had strength like his, then would the little fellow’s family stop us from being together? If....

To a certain degree, possessing strength was equivalent to possessing everything in this world!

Bang! Bang! Bang!

Meanwhile, numerous deafening bangs resounded once more from within the palace.

At this moment, Xiao Yuxi glanced at Yang Ye and said, “If you fight Mu Jun in the future, then remember to be careful!”

When she spoke up to here, she paused for a moment and continued. “Actually, you have to be careful when you fight anyone here. Because you have no advantage against anyone! After all, their natural talents aren’t inferior to your own while their background is infinitely better than yours. They don’t have to worry about cultivation techniques and combat techniques at all, yet you....”

Yang Ye smiled and said, “I know. I don’t have the slightest advantage when facing them, so I must madly improve my strength!”

Bang!

Right when Xiao Yuxi was about to say something, a world shaking bang resounded abruptly, and then the palace exploded beneath their solemn gazes to reveal the people within the palace.

Yang Ye knew all of them.

The three outstanding geniuses of the central territory stood on the left while a young man in a golden robe embroidered with a dragon was standing in front of the three geniuses.

On the other hand, Mo Ke, Hun You, and Ying Long were standing on the right.

At this moment, Mo Ke revealed a slightly savage expression, and his body even emanated countless strands of horrifying black colored Devil Energy.

The gold robed young man who stood facing Mo Ke had a slightly solemn expression as well while layers of golden air effused out from him. If one looked closely at this air, one would notice that it was a golden dragon!

There was a stone sarcophagus between their groups, and a completely dark and devilish spear that emanated a chilly and deathly aura floated above it!

Xiao Yuxi spoke in a low voice. “The Nether God’s Spear!”

Yang Ye hurriedly asked. “What rank is it?”

He wasn’t interested in treasures beneath the Heaven Rank. Actually, it wasn’t that he wasn’t interested, but it wasn’t worth going head to head with these fellows for something below the Heaven Rank!

“It has no rank!” Xiao Yuxi shook her head and said, “This spear has a special characteristic — it grows stronger according to its owner. Because it possesses an almost boundless strength, the amount of strength within it that is activated depends completely upon on its owner!”

“Mo Ke wants that spear?” asked Yang Ye.

She nodded and said, “It should be like that. If he’s able to obtain that spear, then he’ll be able to instantly activate 30% of its strength. At that time, besides a few people, there would probably be no one capable of resisting a single strike of his spear!”

Yang Ye stated immediately. “He can’t be allowed to obtain it!”

Mo Ke’s strength was already formidable to the extreme. So, if he was allowed to obtain this spear, then how terrifying would his strength be?

Xiao Yuxi nodded in agreement, and then she said, “That’s exactly what Mu Jun and the others are thinking. So, they took action to stop Mo Ke!”

As Yang Ye and Xiao Yuxi spoke softly, both of them hadn’t noticed that the little fellow’s large eyes had instantly lit up when she saw the Nether God’s Spear, and a faint violet glow flickered into appearance on its little claw....

Mo Ke gazed at Mu Jun with a gloomy expression as he said, “As expected of the next Emperor of the Exalted Han Empire. Your Imperial Energy is already pure to the point of taking the form of a dragon!”

“You’re not bad yourself!” Mu Jun smiled and said, “You’re actually completely fine after you suffered a strike from my King Path Fist. If I’m not wrong, you’re the only successor to become the next Devil Lord, right?”

Mo Ke didn’t answer Mu Jun. He turned around to gaze at Hun You before he said, “I know you hid your strength earlier. Help me obtain the Nether God’s Spear, and I, Mo Ke, promise that I’ll definitely do my best to help you obtain the Nether God’s inheritance. I’ll do as I’ve said. What do you think?”

Hun You’s brows raised as he asked in a low voice. “Really?”

Mo Ke stated. “Of course!”

“Hehe....” Hun You laughed gloomily, and then a pitch black chain instantly appeared in front of him. He said, “I’ll help you hold off two of those three geniuses from the central territory. Deal with the rest yourself. If you can’t, then I can’t do anything about it!”

Mo Ke nodded, and then he turned to gaze at Ying Long and said, “Help me this time and I’ll give the 1st scroll of the Heavenly Devil Physique to you!”

“You’re willing to do that?” A wisp of excitement appeared in Ying Long’s eyes.

“Do I have a choice?”

“Haha!” Ying Long roared with laughter, and then his figure shook. He returned to his original form and shot into the sky before his vital energy locked onto Mu Jun and the others.

“You’ll deal with two of us on your own?” Meanwhile, Xi Luo suddenly stepped forward, and he gazed at Hun You as he said, “A freak who’s neither man nor ghost like you actually dares to speak about fighting two of us on your own? Are you sure you brought your brain out with you today? If you didn’t, then I can help you look for it!” As soon as he finished speaking, an ax appeared in his hand!

“Wouldn’t you know if I did or didn’t by giving it a try yourself?” Hun You said in a cold voice, “Do you really think the three of you are extraordinary? Today, I’ll allow the three of you to witness what a true monstrous genius is like!” As soon as he finished speaking, Hun You issued a command in his heart, and the Nether Chain in his hand instantly pierced through space and attacked Xi Luo!

“Bring it on!” Xi Luo shouted, and then he swiftly chopped at the chain with his ax....

As he watched Xi Luo and Hun You battle, Mu Jun pondered deeply for a moment before he said, “Miss Nangong, I’ll be troubling you to lend Xi Luo a hand!”

Nangong Meng frowned and said, “Yare you doubting Xi Luo’s strength?”

Mu Jun shook his head and said, “I’m not doubting his strength, and it’s because Hun You had concealed his strength. If I’m not wrong, then he might have comprehended Night Intent. If it’s at any other ordinary time, Xi Luo would be able to retreat unharmed even if he lost to Hun You. However, we’re in the Nether God’s Tomb right now, so the slightest mistake might cause Xi Luo to be heavily injured!”

“Night Intent?” Nangong Meng was shocked and said, “How could that be possible?”

“Nothing is impossible!” Mu Jun said in a low voice, “Look at Hun You’s figure. Even though he’s concealing it with all his might, his figure is unconsciously fusing into one with the darkness of night. So, the slightest mistake from Xi Luo would make him suffer a huge loss. You should be aware of what the consequences of being heavily injured in the Ancient Battlefield are!”

Nangong Meng gazed at Hun You for a short while before she finally stopped hesitating. Her figure flashed through space and joined the battle between Xi Luo and Hun You.

Xi Luo frowned when he saw Nangong Meng lend him a hand. He was just about to speak when Nangong Meng spoke before him. “Cut the crap. Let’s join forces and kill this freak first!”

Xi Luo was instantly delighted when he heard this. “Alright! Meng’meng, we’re a couple that’s of one heart. If two people are of the same mind, then they can cut through anything! HAHA!” As he spoke, his figure shot explosively towards Hun You.

Nangong Meng was speechless.

Li Qingshui instantly entered into battle with Ying Long as well, and then only Mo Ke and Mu Jun remained.

“Bring it on!” Mu Jun smiled as he spoke.

“As you wish!” The Devil Energy throughout Mo Ke’s body instantly erupted explosively. However, right at this moment, a strand of violet light flashed, and then the Nether God’s Spear vanished before the gazes of Mu Jun and Mo Ke!

At the same time, the violet mink who was hiding in the shadows was holding the Nether God’s Spear which was a few times larger than her....

After being stunned for a moment, the first thought that came into Yang Ye’s mind was — We’re in huge trouble!

On the other hand, the corners of Xiao Yuxi’s mouth couldn’t help but twitch.
