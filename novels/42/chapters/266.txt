Chapter 267 – The Rewards Of The Ascension Rankings!

Yang Ye said, “Senior, since the Devil Race is so formidable, then why have I never heard of it nor seen any of their members in the southern territory?”

“That’s naturally because my Grand Qin Empire and the six great powers worked together to conceal it!” The Founding Emperor said, “The Devil Race is an enormous threat to both our human race and the Darkbeasts. If it wasn’t for the Heaven Tower Mountain Range acting as a barrier, the current owners of the southern territory would probably not be our human race and the Darkbeasts. It would be the Devil Race instead!”

“Since there’s the Heaven Tower Mountain Range there, then what’s the Ancient Battlefield?” Yang Ye was puzzled.

“Every single year, countless youths from the Devil Race would climb over Heaven Tower Mountain Range on foot. Most of these youths would perish while climbing over the mountain range. However, so long as they succeeded, then their strength and natural talent would absolutely be horrifying. To put it simply, if you and Yuan Tong were asked to climb over that mountain range, then with the natural talent and strength both of you possess, both of you would only have a 30% chance at most!” said the Founding Emperor.

Yang Ye was shocked. With the Founding Emperor’s identity and strength, since he’d said they had a 30% chance, then they probably really had a mere 30% chance. While both he and Yuan Tong only had a 30% chance of success, those youths of the Devil Race were able to climb over the mountain range instead. Moreover, it was more than one. So, such natural talent and strength....

Yang Ye took a deep breath, suppressed the shock in his heart, and then he asked. “Why have they come to our human world!?”

“To temper themselves!” The Founding Ancestor said in a low voice, “The Devil Race is a race that respects the strong. Climbing over Heaven Tower Mountain Range is a form of tempering, and the battles between them and the geniuses of the younger generation of our human race is a form of tempering is well. The objective behind their actions is naturally to allow themselves to become stronger. Of course, besides becoming stronger, exhausting the number of geniuses in the younger generation of our human race is probably another one of the Devil Exalt’s objectives!”

The Devil Exalt! Yang Ye was shocked again when he heard this name. Because he’d heard of the Devil Exalt from Yin Xuan’er. However, he hadn’t imagined that the number one expert in the southern territory would actually not be a human profounder but a member of the Devil Race!”

“Do you know why we held the Ascension Rankings?” asked the Founding Emperor.

Yang Ye shook his head.

“Because we wanted to choose strong profounders to head to the Ancient Battlefield. It isn’t just these independent cultivators of the southern territory that will be heading to the Ancient Battlefield, even the disciples of the various great powers and the elites of the Darkbeast Empire will be going as well. All of you have a single mission, and it’s to do your best to annihilate those young geniuses of the Devil Race!” said the Founding Emperor in a low voice.

Yang Ye remained silent for a short while before he said, “Since Senior paid such a huge price to save me and allow my mother to live for five more years, it’s naturally impossible for your objective behind it to be so simple as merely representing the Grand Qin Empire to fight the youths of the Devil Race, right?”

The Founding Emperor chuckled and said, “It isn’t so complicated. Besides out of consideration for the fact that you’re the one this little girl has taken a liking to, it’s also because my Empire will fight the Flower Palace sooner or later. Of course, if you didn’t possess natural talent that I thought highly of, then I would naturally not pay such a huge price. Since you have natural talent and potential while my Empire would be fighting the Flower Palace sooner or later, then why shouldn’t I rescue you and make the Flower Palace have another terrifying genius who possesses great potential as its enemy?”

“But heading to the Ancient Battlefield doesn’t seem to benefit the Empire at all, right?” asked Yang Ye.

“Of course it does!” The Founding Emperor said, “Even though there’s only a slim chance of survival, heading to the Ancient Battlefield is an opportunity for the members of my Imperial Household to grow stronger. If the members of my Imperial Household die at the hands of the youths from the Devil Race because their strengths were inferior, then they deserved death. However, you ought to be aware of the relationship between my Empire and the six great powers. I’m worried that the members of my Imperial Household would perish at the hands of the disciples from the six great powers instead!”

“You want me to protect the disciples of the Imperial Household?” Yang Ye frowned as he spoke.

The Founding Emperor nodded lightly and said, “Because we have an agreement with the Devil Exalt, and experts at the Spirit Realm and above can’t make an appearance at the Ancient Battlefield. So, my Empire is utterly unable to dispatch experts to protect the members of the imperial household from the shadows. On the other hand, once they make an appearance at the Ancient Battlefield, then the six great powers would definitely join forces against them. So, I need your help! Besides that, it’s extremely beneficial for you to head to the Ancient Battlefield as well. After all, it’s an ancient ruin, and even though it’s filled with all sorts of dangers, that place is filled with all sorts of fortuitous encounters as well. Moreover, there are countless experts to be your sparring partners there. Isn’t that exactly what you need right now?”

Yang Ye shook his head slowly and said, “Senior, I want to become strong for the sake of rescuing my mother. If I can’t rescue my mother, then would there be any point in it even if I, Yang Ye, become the number one expert in the southern territory?”

The Founding Emperor grinned and said, “I understand your worries. Don’t worry, since Yu Linglong has made a deal with me, then she will naturally not go back on her word. Your mother will definitely be fine for the next five years of time. As for five years from now....” When he spoke up to here, the Founding Emperor paused for a moment and said, “If you want to save your mother, then you must ceaselessly strengthen yourself during these five years of time. The matters of the world are ever-changing. If you don’t become stronger, then perhaps you might vanish from the world tomorrow. Then, who would rescue your mother?”

Yang Ye fell silent when he heard this. Right, in short, it’s because my strength is too weak. I received the Founding Emperor’s help today and was able to survive the Flower Palace’s Master, but what about the next time? Who would help me then?Become stronger! Become stronger! At this moment, Yang Ye urgently desired to become stronger. Because only by becoming stronger would he be able to survive. Only by surviving would he have the opportunity to rescue his mother!

“Senior, when will I be heading to the Ancient Battlefield?” asked Yang Ye.

When he saw Yang Ye stop being obsessed about rescuing his mother, the Founding Emperor grinned and said, “The Ancient Battlefield will be opened a month from now. At that time, my Grand Qin Empire will notify all the profounders that possess sufficient strength, the disciples of the countless clans in the Empire, and some of the elite troops of my Empire that they should gather here. After that, they’ll be teleported to the Ancient Battlefield via the teleportation formation here!”

“Senior intends to dispatch the army there?” Yang Ye was astounded.

The Founding Emperor nodded lightly and said, “Even though it’s extremely dangerous to them, it’s an enormous opportunity as well. It’s an opportunity to become stronger. Of course, the elite forces will head to the Ancient Battlefield as independent cultivators. Otherwise, they would probably die at the hands of humans before they can even fight the youths of the Devil Race!”

Yang Ye shook his head. The human race still intends to kill each other while facing the threat of such a terrifying existence. The human race is really courting death! However, it wasn’t related to him at all!

“Try your best not to leave the Imperial Capital during this month. It isn’t just the Flower Palace that intends to kill you now, even the Origin School and Ghost Sect probably intend to eliminate you as well,” said the Founding Emperor.

Yang Ye nodded.

“Heading to the Ancient Battlefield is a new beginning for you. Because there are no experts at the Spirit Realm and above there. So, you can swiftly improve your strength there, and only there would you be able to freely improve your strength without worrying about the other powers dispatching extraordinary experts to kill you. So, make good use of this opportunity!” After he finished saying all of this, the Founding Emperor’s figure flashed and vanished on the spot.

After the Founding Emperor left, Yang Ye turned around to look at Qin Xiyue who’d been silent until now, and he said, “Thank you!”

Qin Xiyue shook her head and smiled before she said, “You don’t have to thank me. If you didn’t comprehend 4th level Sword Intent, if you didn’t possess the Enlightened Sword Heart, and if you didn’t defeat Yuan Tong, then my Imperial Grandfather wouldn’t have saved you. You ought to be very clearly aware of that!”

Right when Yang Ye was about to say something, Li Si suddenly appeared in front of Yang Ye, and then he nodded slightly to Qin Xiyue before he gazed at Yang Ye. With a flip of his palm, a spatial ring had appeared in his palm, and he said, “This is the reward for the 1st on the Ascension Rankings. Besides that, Young Brother Yang’s name has probably spread throughout the southern territory by now. So, if it’s possible, then try your best not to use your true name in front of outsiders. After all, there are numerous people that want to kill you!”

Yang Ye nodded, and then he received the spatial ring and said, “Thank you for the reminder, Senior!”

Li Si grinned and said, “Don’t mention it. Since you’re Princess Xiyue’s husband, then you’re a member of my Grand Qin Empire. Even though you can’t hold a position in the Imperial Court....” When he spoke up to here, two command tokens appeared in Li Si’s palm, and he said, “One of these two command tokens is the Ascension Token, the reward from the Ascension Rankings. The other is a token from the Founding Emperor. You can travel freely through the Empire with this token in your possession. Moreover, you can mobilize the guards of all the cities except the Imperial Capital!” Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Yang Ye was shocked when he heard this. Mobilize the guards from all the cities? Why would the Founding Emperor give me such huge authority?

After pondering deeply for a moment, Yang Ye didn’t refuse it and accept the two command tokens. He gazed at the Ascension and pondered deeply for a brief moment before he grunted coldly. He’d taken great pains to obtain the 1st position on the Ascension Rankings all for the sake of this Ascension Token. However, when he finally obtained it now, it was like a piece of scrap metal!

Li Si nodded lightly when he saw Yang Ye accept the command tokens, and then his figure flashed and vanished on the spot.

After Li Si left, Yang Ye passed the command tokens to Qin Xiyue and said, “These two command tokens are no different than scrap metal in my possession, and they ought to be of use in yours!”

Qin Xiyue glanced at the two command tokens before she said, “You really intend to give them to me? Do you know their uses? Especially that token from my Imperial Grandfather. With that in your possession, the authority you possess wouldn’t be inferior to a general with actual authority!”

Yang Ye shook his head and said, “What a joke! Should I take the Ascension Token and request something from the Origin School or the Ghost Sect? Or perhaps the Flower Palace? I would thank the heavens if they didn’t come looking for me, whereas, going to look for them would be like courting death. As for the Founding Emperor’s token, I’ll be heading to the Ancient Battlefield soon. Can I mobilize the guards of the Empire to head to the Ancient Battlefield with me? So, they are no different than pieces of scrap metal to me, and they’ll only be put to the best use in your hands!”
