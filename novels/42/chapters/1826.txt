Chapter 1827 – Yang Ye’s Senior Brother?

Snowy blinked, and then she quickly wrapped her claws around Yang Ye and pulled backwards. But how could she pull him?

At this moment, Snowy was anxious to the point of being on the verge of tears!

Just like that, Yang Ye and Snowy walked into the darkness.

Yang Ye had regained his calm and composure by now.

Qiong Qi and Hou Qing remained silent, and the Primordial Pagoda was quiet.

He knew that he’d definitely encountered something serious.

So, acting rashly was completely useless right now.

Yang Ye looked up. There was a tree around 30m tall by the mountain wall. The tree was completely pitch black, and there were around ten pure white flowers on it. The flowers were extremely white as if they were made from snow!

Beneath the flowers were numerous fist-sized fruits. The fruits were completely red and seemed quite gorgeous!

There was a man with shoulder-length hair seated cross-legged below the tree.

Because the man’s head was lowered, Yang Ye couldn’t see his appearance.

Yang Ye sized up the man and asked, “May I know who you are?”

The man looked up at Yang Ye. At this moment, Yang Ye saw his appearance clearly. The man was around 30 years of age. He looked like a middle aged man, and his face was calm and without a trace of evil.

Suddenly, the man said, “You want this tree?”

Yang Ye glanced at it and said, “I do.”

The man nodded slightly, “Everyone who wanted it is dead. However, you may be an exception!”

Yang Ye replied, “Please do tell!”

The man gazed at Yang Ye for a few breaths of time and said, “Your mentality isn’t bad. Outstanding indeed. My goal is very simple. I want to leave this place. Can you help me?”

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings and said, “I don’t really understand!”

Meanwhile, the man stood up slowly. As soon as he did, the area shook. In an instant, the three mountains that surrounded the gorge started to tremble violently, and then countless beams of light that were fine as threads shot out from the peaks of those mountains. In the end, they struck the middle aged man.

At this moment, it was like he was wearing a golden robe of nets!

At the same time, a golden circle appeared below his feet. The circle was spinning rapidly while strands of golden light surged towards his feet, and then they covered him in layers!

The middle aged man gazed at Yang Ye, “See?”

Yang Ye spoke solemnly, “What’s that?”

The middle aged man replied, “A formation. A formation used specially to trap people like me.”

Yang Ye said, “Your strength far surpasses my own. Since even you can’t break through it, do you think that I can?” 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

The middle aged man suddenly gazed at the sword in Yang Ye’s grasp, “You can’t, but that sword of yours can!”

The wooden sword! Yang Ye said, “You recognize it?”

The middle aged man nodded slightly, “Of course. The Sovereign of Man’s sword. Everyone from the large universe recognizes it!”

The large universe! Yang Ye was shocked. He hadn’t expected the man to actually be from up there. However, it did make sense. Because only someone from up there would possess such terrifying strength.

Yang Ye asked, “Who trapped you here?”

The middle aged man shook his head slightly, “You wouldn’t know even if I told you. So, it doesn’t make a difference. So long as you can break open this formation, this tree is yours.”

Yang Ye asked, “What if I can’t?”

“Then leave your life behind!” The middle aged man continued, “I hope someone comes here, but I don’t want many to come here. Especially some people. So, you should understand what I’m trying to say, right?”

Yang Ye chuckled, “I don’t seem to have a choice.”

“You have another choice!” The middle aged man said, “You can choose to kill me.”

Kill? Yang Ye shook his head and rejected that idea. The strength this middle aged man revealed was absolutely superior to the woman in a red dress. Of course, he didn’t know if it was still superior to her now. Because her strength was gradually recovering. She was growing stronger with each passing day. So, he didn’t know how strong she was right now!

In short, the middle aged man was definitely not someone he could resist.

After standing there silently for a long time, Yang Ye held the wooden sword tightly while his profound energy surged madly. Around two breaths of time later, he suddenly swung his sword.

Hiss!

A ray of sword energy tore through the air and instantly struck the golden threads in front of the man.

Clang!

Sparks flickered.

Around two breaths of time later, the middle aged man looked down. The golden threads were still intact, but there was a mark on them. A change occurred in his eyes when he witnessed this!

The middle aged man looked up at Yang Ye, “As expected of the Sovereign of Man’s sword. It can even damage this formation. Come on! Continue!”

Yang Ye glanced at the middle aged man and waved the sword again.

Just like that, Yang Ye swung the sword, over and over again. As he ceaselessly swung it, the golden threads on the middle aged man grew fewer and fewer. As for the golden circle below his feet, it grew dimmer and dimmer.

Yang Ye would never place his hopes on someone else. But at this moment, he had no other choice. Everything was useless before absolute strength. However, Yang Ye was quite puzzled by why Qiong Qi, Hou Qing, and the Primordial Pagoda suddenly acted in that way.

They feared him?

Qiong Qi and Hou Qing may fear the middle aged man, but they would definitely not be afraid of him. So, there was definitely another reason why they suddenly acted like this!

However, he clearly didn’t have the time to think about that right now.

Swing after swing!

Finally, after around an hour passed, the golden threads that surrounded the middle aged man finally vanished completely.

Yang Ye lowered his sword, moved aside, and then gazed at the middle aged man. At the same time, he tightened his grip on his sword. If the middle aged man went back on his word, then Yang Ye would naturally not just sit there and wait for death to arrive. He wasn’t completely helpless against the middle aged man.

He had one last trump card that he didn’t wasn’t to use unless he had no other choice!

The middle aged man took a deep breath, “I’m finally free. After 10,000 years of imprisonment… I’m finally free….”

10,000 years! Yang Ye’s eyelids twitched. He was actually imprisoned for 10,000 years! I wonder who imprisoned him!

Meanwhile, the middle aged man gazed at Yang Ye, “Do you know who imprisoned me here?”

Yang Ye shook his head.

The middle aged man replied, “An old man wearing a Daoist’s robes!”

The old man in Daoist’s robes!

Yang Ye was stunned!

He hadn’t expected this fellow to have been imprisoned here by the old man in Daoist’s robes.

Meanwhile, the middle aged man added, “He was just a clone, but I know who he is.”

Yang Ye glanced at the middle aged man, “Why did he imprison you?”

The middle aged replied, “Because I came down here when the barrier weakened. I had bad luck and encountered his clone once I descended here. Actually, I thought I would die because it was against the rules for people of the large universe to descend here. Those who go against the rules are sentenced to death! However, he didn’t kill me!”

Yang Ye asked, “Why?”

The middle aged man said, “I don’t know.” He gazed at Yang Ye and continued, “I sense his aura from you. What’s your relationship with him?”

Yang Ye didn’t answer the question and replied with a question, “Will you seek vengeance from him?”

“Vengeance?” The middle aged man was stunned, and then he chuckled, “Just a clone of his could seal me all those years ago. Do you think I can seek vengeance from him?”

Yang Ye smiled, “Right!”

Meanwhile, the middle aged man waved his right hand, and the tree immediately floated over to Yang Ye, “I, Hao Tian, always keep my word. This is yours.”

Yang Ye glanced at him and took the tree, “Thank you.”

Hao Tian smiled, “It’s I who should thank you. Even I don’t know how long more I’d be trapped here if it wasn’t for you!”

Yang Ye glanced at the wooden sword and said, “Why can it break through barriers?”

Hao Tian glanced at the wooden sword in Yang Ye’s grasp, “Because it contains the energy of the sun, moon, and stars; the soul of the earth; and the spirit of all things. All formations rely on the world to be built and sustained. So, no matter what formation or barrier it is, so long as it’s formed by relying on the world, it can’t stop that sword!”

I see! Yang Ye nodded slightly. No wonder it stabbed through the barrier when it fell from the large universe!

Meanwhile, Hao Tian said, “However, there’s a type of formation that doesn’t rely on the world, and it forms a whole on its own. Your sword may find it difficult to pierce. However, if your strength is sufficiently strong, then you can still break through any formation with that sword.”

Yang Ye smiled, “If my strength is sufficient, I can do it even without this sword, right?”

Hao Tian replied, “True!”

Yang Ye didn’t say another word. He just cupped his fists, “I have other matters to attend to. Farewell.”

Yang Ye’s figure vanished towards the distance.

Once Yang Ye vanished, the smile on Hao Tian’s face gradually vanished. He looked at the direction Yang Ye vanished towards for a long time, and then he spoke softly, “Righteous yet evil at the same time. He possesses Enlightened Rank slaughter intent yet can actually use that sword… Strange!”

He fell silent for a long time after that, and then he glanced at the surroundings and looked up at the sky, “Sovereign of Earth, I’ll get even with you really soon!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he vanished on the spot.

The mountains in the surroundings vanished along with him.

They’d been obliterated without making a single sound!

…

Once Yang Ye left, he immediately sped up and flew over 10m away. Meanwhile, Qiong Qi’s voice suddenly resounded in Yang Ye’s mind, “Kid, do you know who he is?”

Yang Ye was about to speak when Qiong Qi’s voice resounded again, “Strictly speaking, you’re both from the same line. So, you may have to call him senior brother….”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.
