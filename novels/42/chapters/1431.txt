Chapter 1432 – Perhaps It Isn’t Helping You!

After teasing Zhuang Weiran for a while, Yang Ye left Clouds of Heaven Stellar Region and went to Stellar City.

Azure Cloud Merchant Group’s headquarters was on Cloud Merchant Stellar Region, so he naturally had to travel through Stellar City. Because travelling through space exhausted too much profound energy. So, teleportation was much more convenient.

Yang Ye didn’t stay in Stellar City, and he immediately traveled to the teleportation platforms there, paid the required divine crystals, and entered one of the teleportation formations.

After quite some time passed, Yang Ye opened his eyes. At this moment, he was at a point in outer space, and a teleportation formation was behind him.

“State your identity!” Suddenly, a voice resounded through the area, and then an old man appeared near Yang Ye.

It was a Deity!

Yang Ye wasn’t surprised. After all, the teleportation formations of a stellar region were usually guarded, and it was naturally for the sake of preventing other stellar formations from using the teleportation formations to launch surprise attacks.

The old man stared at Yang Ye and asked, “Who are you?!”

Yang Ye spoke flatly, “Yang Ye!”

Yang Ye! The old man’s pupils constricted, “You... you’re Yang Ye!”

The old man naturally knew Yang Ye’s name. After all, did anyone in the Eastern Territory not know Yang Ye’s name? He was a terrifying existence who’d slaughtered a city and killed over 20 Deities in one go!

The old man became extremely vigilant, “Yang Ye, my Azure Cloud Merchant Group didn’t participate in the battle between Clouds of Heaven Stellar Region and Celestial Demon Stellar Region.” Even though Cloud Merchant Stellar Region was a three star stellar region, not to mention the old man, even the entire stellar region wouldn’t dare to underestimate Yang Ye.

Yang Ye was slightly stunned when he heard the old man, and then he chuckled, “You’ve misunderstood. I’m not here to look for trouble with Azure Cloud Merchant Group, I’m just here to pay a visit to your eldest young miss, Nangong Qin. She’s a friend of mine.”

The old man’s expression eased up slightly as he felt it was fine so long as Yang Ye wasn’t here to look for trouble with them. He sized up Yang Ye and said, “You’re here to see the Eldest Young Miss?”

Yang Ye nodded.

The old man fell silent and was slightly hesitant.

Yang Ye frowned, “What? Has something happened to her?”

The old man was quite shocked when he saw the slightly hostile expression on Yang Ye’s face, and he hurriedly said, “She’s fine. But she had been confined to her room. You have to get the patriarch’s approval if you wish to see her.”

Yang Ye said, “Then can I see your patriarch?”

The old man’s expression was quite unnatural. Could he say no? If he did, what if Yang Ye tried to see the patriarch by force? Based on the reports he’d received, Yang Ye wasn’t someone who was easy to deal with. He was someone who even dared to slaughter a city, so was there anything that he didn’t dare to do?

The old man fell silent for a moment before he said, “The patriarch is in closed door cultivation, so the second young miss is managing the affairs of the merchant group. I’ll take you to see her. You can see the eldest young miss if you obtain her approval.”

Yang Ye nodded, “That works!”

Just like that, the old man led Yang Ye to the main city on Cloud Merchant Continent, Cloud Merchant City. As soon as he entered the city, Yang Ye felt quite shocked. Because it was prosperous beyond his imagination. The buildings in the city were extremely luxurious, and most of them were made of very high quality materials. Besides that, there was a tremendous amount of people in the city. It was extremely bustling, and the roughly 300m wide streets here were filled with people.

It wasn’t just one street but most streets that were crowded with people. They were moving very swiftly and seemed to be busy.

When he saw Yang Ye stop in midair and look down below, the old man said, “Our merchant group established stores in many worlds, and Cloud Merchant City is our headquarters. So, our goods are always sent here, sorted, and transported out. So, we’re very busy.”

Yang Ye nodded slightly and said, “Your merchant group should be really wealthy.” He still remembered how the second young miss of Azure Cloud Merchant Group had lost 100,000 divine crystals to Ye Liuyun and casually produced 80,000 on the spot.

“Of course!” There was a trace of pride on the old man’s face, “Besides Stellar City, there’s no other power in the Eastern Territory that can compare to us. We....”

The old man seemed to have thought of something and suddenly stopped. He glanced at Yang Ye and said, “Actually, we aren’t very rich. We’re just alright.”

The corners of Yang Ye’s mouth twitched. I’m not going to steal from you. Do you have to act like that?

Actually, that was exactly what the old man feared. After all, it was no secret in Azure Cloud Merchant Group that Yang Ye had led Elder Yuan’s group of three to steal spirit veins.

The old man led Yang Ye to a hall called Cloud Hall. However, Yang Ye and the old man didn’t enter because a black robed old man obstructed their path.

The black robed old man gazed at the old man by Yang Ye’s side and frowned, “Elder Li, why have you returned instead of guarding the teleportation formation?”

Elder Li bowed slightly to the black robed old man and said, “Grand Elder, someone wants to see the second young miss. So, I brought him here....”

“The second young miss?” The black robed old man gazed at Yang Ye and said, “Who are you?”

Yang Ye replied, “Yang Ye!”

The black robed old man’s eyes instantly narrowed slightly. He gazed at Yang Ye for a long time before he said, “You’re Clouds of Heaven Stellar Region’s Yang Ye?”

Yang Ye rubbed his nose. My reputation has spread quite a bit. Everyone knows me.

Meanwhile, the black robed old man said, “May I know why you’ve come to my Azure Cloud Merchant Group?”

Yang Ye replied, “I’m here to see a friend, Nangong Qin. Right, she’s your eldest young miss. However, I heard she has been confined, and I have to obtain your second young miss’s approval to see her. So, I’m here to see your second young miss!”

The black robed old man was slightly stunned, “You are friends with the eldest young miss?”

Yang Ye said, “Can’t I?”

The old man sized up Yang Ye and had quite a strange expression on his face. He hadn’t expected Yang Ye to actually say that he was friends with Nangong Qi. Needless to say, being friends with Yang Ye was no trivial matter, but it depended on how deep their friendship was. If they were just ordinary friends, then it wouldn’t be a very big deal.

But if they were very good friends, then it would be extraordinary.

The black robed old man fell silent for a while and said, “The second young miss is with an important guest, and she asked to not be disturbed....”

Yang Ye smiled, “It’s fine. I can wait!”

The old man glanced at Yang Ye and felt slightly surprised. He seems quite easy to deal with. Moreover, he doesn’t feel oppressive or overbearing at all.

They saw he likes to attack for the slightest disagreement. The rumors don’t seem to be very true!

The black robed old man restrained his thoughts and said, “Alright. I’ll take you to see her once she’s done.”

Yang Ye nodded, “Thank you!”

The old man glanced at Yang Ye. He really is quite easy to deal with.

The black robed old man didn’t speak further. He just nodded slightly to Yang Ye, turned around, and left.

Once the black robed old man left, Yang Ye gazed at Elder Li and said, “Go on with your business. I’ll wait here by myself.”

Elder Li hesitated for a moment, and then he nodded and left.

Once Elder Li left, Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings, and then he sat down cross-legged at the side.

He intended to cultivate.

As far as he was concerned, he couldn’t waste a second now. Because every second that passed was his life ticking away!

Around an hour later, a young man and two old men appeared in the distance. They quickly arrived before the entrance of the hall. However, the black robed old man appeared once more when they were about to head in.

“The second young miss is in a meeting. No one is allowed to disturb her!” The black robed old man vanished once he finished speaking.

The young man hesitated for a moment, and then moved towards the side. He didn’t dare to force his way in. After waiting for a while, he suddenly gazed at Yang Ye who was seated cross-legged at the side, and his eyes instantly had a ferocious glow in them when he saw Yang Ye’s appearance.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye gazed at the young man as well. Yang Ye couldn’t help but feel stunned when he saw the ferocity and desire to kill in the young man’s eyes. Do I know that fellow?

“What? You don’t remember me?” The young man stared fixedly at Yang Ye, “Let me remind you. Stellar City, the second young miss!”

Yang Ye sized up the young man, and he recalled who the young man was. The second young miss had a young man by her side that day, and that young man had attacked him when conflict arose between him and the second young miss. However, the young man had been punched flying.

Yang Ye hadn’t expected to actually meet the young man here. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Meanwhile, the young man led the two old men over to Yang Ye and spoke fiercely, “I’d intended to go looking for you, but you’ve actually appeared before me now. Looks like even the heavens are helping me!”

Yang Ye glanced at the young man and said, “Perhaps it isn’t.”

“It isn’t?” The young man laughed ferociously and waved his right hand, “Tear all four of his limbs off.”

Suddenly, Yang Ye said, “You don’t recognize me?”

He wasn’t being narcissistic, but he felt that his name should carry some weight. Moreover, the young man should know his name. However, the young man had still come to look for trouble with him, and that was quite strange. After all, only one of the old men behind the young man was a Deity!

The young man ridiculed, “Recognize you? How laughable! I should recognize you?”

As soon as he finished speaking, he waved right hand, “Tear off all four of his limbs! No, tear his fifth limb off as well!”
