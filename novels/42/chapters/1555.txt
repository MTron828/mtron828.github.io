Chapter 1556 - The Divine Phoenix Clan!

Translator: InVader

The Divine Phoenix Clan’s status in the demon race was absolutely great. Not to mention the Demon Territory, it was renowned throughout the large world.

The Hallowed Grounds of the Divine Phoenix Clan could be said to be a place that countless demon beasts yearned to go to. Actually, demon beasts weren’t the only ones, even humans wanted to go there. Because it was a true paradise of cultivation.

The Divine Phoenix Clan’s Hallowed Grounds was a place of cultivation that the experts of the Divine Phoenix Clan had created. That place contained the purest form of fire element energy and the energy of the earth. Coupled with the numerous Energy Convergence Formations that the experts of the Divine Phoenix Clan had set up there, it was a true paradise of cultivation.

However, it wasn’t easy to get in there. Not to mention outsiders, even the members of the Divine Phoenix Clan itself had to fulfil many harsh requirements to cultivate there.

Because regardless of whether it was the energy of the earth or the fire element energy, they weren’t boundless. If they were absorbed without restraint, then the Hallowed Grounds would be ruined one day.

The reason the Divine Phoenix Clan was willing to allow the top three in the Meeting of the Clans to cultivate there was naturally the Demon God’s Palace.

Even though the Demon God wasn’t in this universe anymore, the Divine Phoenix Clan still had to give face to the Demon God.

Yang Ye and the others departed for the Divine Phoenix Clan under Gu Mo’s lead.

Even though it was in the Demon Territory, the Divine Phoenix Clan had established its own world here, the Phoenix Domain. Not to mention humans, even the demon beasts of the demon race couldn’t enter the Phoenix Domain without the Divine Phoenix Clan’s permission.

Gu Ma spoke while they traveled, “Be careful once you arrive at the Divine Phoenix Clan.”

Yang Ye gazed at Gu Mo and asked, “Why? Is it dangerous?”

“Not that!” Gu Mo shook his head, “The Divine Phoenix Clan is very proud, extremely proud. So, they may not have a very good attitude when dealing with us.”

Pride!

Yang Ye nodded. He’d seen how proud Mo Xiaoleng was. That little girl was absolutely proud.

Meanwhile, Gu Mo said, “All of you’re going there to cultivate. So, besides cultivating, it’s best to not go anywhere else in there and avoid causing unnecessary trouble.”

Ku Yuan and Yan Lingxue nodded while Yang Ye fell silent.

His objective was to get into the Divine Phoenix Clan and find out where Snowy and Zi’er were being held. So long as he found them, he would take them with him and leave the Demon Territory. But he was very well aware that it wouldn't go that smoothly.

However, it didn’t matter to him because he was ready for the worst.

It didn’t take long for their group to enter the Phoenix Domain.

Once they entered the Phoenix Domain, the temperature around them instantly rose drastically. Besides that, the scene here shocked Yang Ye quite a bit. Because it was covered in flames. Even if there was a forest and water here, they were still covered in unknown flames. Even the clouds in the sky were made of fire.

It was a world of fire!

Suddenly, a flaming phoenix appeared in the distant sky. It was extremely huge and truly blotted out the sky. Once it appeared there, the temperature in the surroundings instantly grew even hotter. No one knew if it was intentional, but a wave of fire swept down from the sky and went straight for Yang Ye’s group.

Ku Yuan and Yan Lingxue’s expressions became quite unsightly. Because the Divine Phoenix Clan was clearly hostile towards them!

Gu Mo’s face fell. After all, the Divine Phoenix Clan was clearly trying to put on a show of strength!

Even though the Demon God’s Palace wasn’t the leader of the demon race anymore, there hadn’t been a single clan that had dared to bully it. But the Divine Phoenix Clan was clearly not giving him any face right now.

Gu Mo took a step forward, and then he slapped his palm upwards.

Bang!

A terrifying wave of energy swept up, and then the wave of fire was instantly obliterated.

Meanwhile, the flaming phoenix in the sky was clearly infuriated by Gu Mo’s actions, and it immediately flapped its wings. A strand of flames shot down from the sky, and it instantly transformed the sky into an ocean of flames.

Gu Mo’s eyes narrowed slightly, and then he clenched his right fist and slammed it upwards.

Bang!

A terrifying wave of force surged out from his fist. As soon as it came into contact with the ocean of flames in the sky, the ocean of flames was instantly blasted into bits, and it transformed into specks of fire that rained down from the sky.

Gu Mo looked up at the phoenix and asked, “Is this how the Divine Phoenix Clan treats its guests?”

The phoenix in the sky shook, and then it transformed into a middle aged man who arrived in front of Gu Mo. The middle aged man glanced at Yang Ye and the others, and then he gazed at Gu Mo, “Elder Gu, it’s not like that. I just wanted to see how strong the top three are.”

Gu Mo spoke indifferently, “They’re all juniors, so why look at their strength? Why don’t you have a look at my strength? I just happen to have not had a good spar in many years.”

It was extremely confrontational!

The middle aged man’s face fell when he heard Gu Mo. Gu Mo was clearly provoking him, but he couldn’t agree to the battle. Because Gu Mo was much stronger than him.

They weren’t on the same level!

Meanwhile, Gu Mo said, “Wasting time here isn’t necessary. Take us to the Hallowed Grounds!” Even though he was quite displeased by what had just happened, he didn’t want to make too much of a big deal about it. So, he gave the middle aged man a way out of this situation.

The middle aged man’s face eased up, and he said, “Come with me!”

As he spoke, his figure transformed into a wave of fire that shot towards the distance.

Gu Mo brought Yang Ye and the others along as he followed after the middle aged man.

Yang Ye was ceaselessly scanning the surroundings as they traveled. Needless to say, it was extremely difficult to find Snowy and Zi’er in the Phoenix Domain. Because he had no idea where they were being kept. The only way to find them was to ask the Divine Phoenix Clan itself. However, would they tell him? He could capture one of them to ask, but he was very well aware that he had to capture one of its higher-ups if he wanted to get any useful information.

Because Snowy’s identity was special, the Divine Phoenix Clan would definitely not allow ordinary members of their clan to know about Snowy. So, there were clearly only a few higher-ups of the Divine Phoenix Clan that were aware of Snowy and Zi’er’s whereabouts.

Moreover, if he wanted to capture one of their higher-ups, it represented that he had to capture a Rebirth Realm expert! Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Even though he was at the Deity Realm now, he really wasn’t certain if he could manage to capture a Rebirth Realm expert.

Yang Ye didn’t have an effective way to deal with the situation before him, and all he could do was take it one step at a time.

It didn’t take long for them to arrive at the Hallowed Grounds.

The Hallowed Grounds was deep underground. When they arrived here, Yang Ye was quite shocked by the energy here.

Regardless of whether it was fire element energy, spirit energy, or the energy of the earth, all of them were extremely pure here. It was countless times purer than the spirit energy in the Primordial Pagoda’s 1st level.

Needless to say, it really was a paradise of cultivation!

The middle aged man glanced at Yang Ye’s group of three and said, “Three months. All of you must leave once three months have passed. Besides that, stay here and cultivate, don’t go anywhere else. Otherwise, all of you may just vanish.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he turned around and vanished on the spot.

Meanwhile, Ku Yuan suddenly said, “Elder Gu, that fellow seems like he really hates us!”

“Of course he does!” Gu Mo spoke indifferently, “Getting in here to cultivate is extremely difficult even for them. Yet now, they’ve given the chance to cultivate here to all of you, so don’t you think they would hate you?”

As he spoke, he glanced at them and continued, “The Divine Phoenix Clan only allowed all of you to cultivate here because of the Demon God. It’s an opportunity for all of you, so cherish it well. Because you may not have another chance to come here!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Gu Mo was about to leave. However, he seemed to have thought of something and said, “Remember not to go anywhere. Even though all of you are quite strong, it’s best to avoid causing any trouble!”

Ku Yuan, Yan Lingxue, and Yang Ye nodded to indicate that they wouldn’t go anywhere.

Gu Mo only left after he saw them guarantee that they wouldn’t go anywhere.

There were over a dozen cultivation rooms in the Hallowed Grounds. Once Gu Mo left, Ku Yuan said, “See you in three months!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he entered one of those rooms.

Once Ku Yuan left, Yan Lingxue gazed at Yang Ye, “You’ve attained the Deity Realm?”

Yang Ye nodded.

Yan Lingxue asked, “How strong are you now?”

Yang Ye smiled, “Why do you ask?”

She replied, “I’m just curious!”

Yang Ye chuckled, “I don’t know how strong I am.”

He wasn’t lying because he hadn’t fought anyone after advancing to the Deity Realm. So, he didn’t have an accurate estimation of his strength.

She gazed at him for a long time and stated, “You’re not from the Goat Clan.”

Yang Ye was slightly stunned, “Why do you say that?”

She remained silent.

Yang Ye smiled, “If I’m not from the Goat Clan, then what am I? You…”

Yan Lingxue suddenly said, “You seem a little like a human!”

Yang Ye’s eyelids twitched. She…

Meanwhile, Yan Lingxue added, “I’ve been to the Human Territory, and I’ve met many humans. You feel like a human.” As soon as she finished speaking, she immediately turned around and entered a cultivation room.

Yang Ye stood silently on the spot for a long time, and then he shook his head and chuckled. After that, he entered a cultivation room as well.

He knew that she’d definitely noticed something. However, it wasn’t important because she had no proof.

In the cultivation room.

Yang Ye sat cross-legged on the ground and was about to cultivate. However, Little Sky Flame suddenly emerged from within him. After she appeared by his side, she glanced at the surroundings. Her eyes lit up, and then she immediately intended to leave the room and head outside.

Yang Ye quickly grabbed her in his arms, “What are you doing?”

She pointed towards the door and sucked while a greedy expression filled her eyes.

The fire element energy! Yang Ye came to an understanding.

There was extremely pure fire element energy here, and Little Sky Flame was a fire element Sprite King. So, the energy here was definitely extremely beneficial to her.

Yang Ye remained silent for a moment, and then he said, “You can absorb it, but do it sneakily. Sneakily, alright? Don’t let anyone find out. Understand?”

Little Sky Flame blinked, and then she nodded while seeming to not understand him completely.

Yang Ye grinned, and then he pinched her cheek gently, “Go on and absorb it, it’s best if you can absorb everything!”
