Chapter 1293 – Just Destroy It!

Yang Ye left without the slightest hesitation.

It was great to him if he could gain control over Slayer Pavilion. Because it would be a huge help for him, but it was fine even if he couldn’t get it. Yang Ye had never been a person who entrusted his hopes with others.

He wasn’t sulking, and it was merely because he felt that if they were going to work together, then they had to cooperate sincerely. But Qian Lankong clearly didn’t trust him and was even acting against him. Based on his temper, not to mention working together, he would even form irreconcilable enmity with the Slayer Pavilion if he were to stay there. So, instead of making the situation develop to such an extent, it was best that they went their separate ways!

Suddenly, Qian Lankong obstructed Yang Ye’s path and said, “How can it have nothing to do with you? The Slayer Pavilion is being attacked by the Yuan Clan and those other powers because of you. If you didn’t disguise yourself as the master of Slayer Pavilion, why would the Yuan Clan and those other powers target the Slayer Pavilion? So, you....”

“Are you joking?” Yang Ye interrupted her, “Because of me? How laughable. Qian Lankong, you need to get your facts straight. It was the Slayer Pavilion that went after my life. Besides that, who killed the Slayer Pavilion’s master? Was it me, or was it you? You are the biggest traitor of the Slayer Pavilion, yet you still have the gall to say that I am the one who brought all of this upon the Slayer Pavilion. Have you no shame? Do you not know any shame? Moreover, even if I did cause it, your Slayer Pavilion deserves it. To be honest, I’ve been really magnanimous by not killing you or attacking the Slayer Pavilion.”

Yang Ye laughed coldly when he spoke up to this point, “Miss Qian, if I’m to be honest, it’s extremely easy to make your Slayer Pavilion collapse. So long as they find out who killed their pavilion master, I think that the Slayer Pavilion will definitely collapse right away. Right? Besides that, the reason I left is because you saved me once, so why our cooperation failed, I still have my sense of morality. Even though we can’t work together, we still have a common enemy, so I think that the Slayer Pavilion and I aren’t enemies. At the very least, we aren’t enemies based on the current situation!”

Qian Lankong remained silent for a long time before she said, “While I wanted to kill the Slayer Pavilion’s master, I had no hatred towards the Slayer Pavilion.”

Yang Ye spoke coldly, “What does that have to do with me?”

She replied, “Everyone in the pavilion thinks you’re the pavilion master now, and they are only willing to obey your commands.”

“So you’re here for that!” Yang Ye continued, “That’s easy. Just tell them that you’re the pavilion master now. Say that I said so. If they don’t believe you, I’ll send them a voice transmission. I don’t mind doing you this tiny favor.”

She looked up at him and said, “We can’t resist the attack of the 5 clans and 2 sects. So, my Slayer Pavilion will surrender.”

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly, “Are you threatening me?”

Qian Lankong said, ‘I’m just speaking about a fact!”

Yang Ye laughed coldly, “It’s fine. So long as it surrenders, I’ll immediately spread the news about the Slayer Pavilion’s master’s death, and I’ll tell the world who killed him.”

Qian Lankong spoke in a low voice, “Do you have to go to such extremes?”

“Extremes?” Yang Ye laughed coldly, “Qian Lankong, you’re really so laughable. If the Slayer Pavilion surrenders, then it’ll become my enemy as well. Should I be benevolent to my enemies? Trust me, I’m not joking. So long as Slayer Pavilion dares to surrender, then I’ll immediately spread the news of the Slayer Pavilion’s master’s death. Miss Qian, I think that you will definitely not try to make Slayer Pavilion surrender. After all, no one wants to be pursued by countless assassins, right?”

Qian Lankong said, “You’ll be pursued as well!”

Yang Ye replied, “Do you think I’m afraid of that?”

Qian Lankong replied, “There’s no need to cause such trouble for both of us, right?”

Yang Ye nodded and said, “You’re very right. It’s not necessary indeed. So, we’ll go our separate ways now!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye started walking off with Zi’er. But it didn’t take long for him to stop again because Qian Lankong was obstructing his path again.

“Just like before, you’re still the pavilion master of Slayer Pavilion,” said Qian Lankong. Surrender to the Yuan Clan and those other powers? She was very clearly aware that if Slayer Pavilion did that, then Yang Ye would definitely do as he said. He would expose the fact that Slayer Pavilion’s master was dead, and she was the one who dealt the final blow. At that time, Slayer Pavilion would definitely fall into chaos. As for her, she would be hunted until she died. After all, she wasn’t the only Voider left in Slayer Pavilion right now.

Moreover, the members of Slayer Pavilion may not agree to surrender. Once they found out that the pavilion master was dead, many would definitely leave Slayer Pavilion and start fresh somewhere else. Or perhaps they would fight to the death for the position of pavilion master. In short, no matter what happened, it wasn’t an outcome that she was wanted.

“The pavilion master?” A wisp of ridicule arose on the corners of Yang Ye’s mouth, “Miss Qian, I’m sorry, but I’m not interested. Just give it to whoever wants it.”

Qian Lankong spoke in a low voice, “What exactly do you want?!”

Yang Ye said, “What do I want?” Qian Lankong, it’s you who should answer that! I worked together with you to take control of Slayer Pavilion, yet you were constantly taking precautions against me and even acted against me. Fine, you can do that, and I just returned the Slayer Pavilion to you. Yet now, you’ve come looking for me when Slayer Pavilion is in trouble. Qian Lankong, do you think I’m your pet? I should come when I’m called and leave at a wave of your hand?”

“Fine, I’ll apologize, alright?” Qian Lankong continued, “I apologize for what happened. I was wrong. I shouldn’t have doubted you and acted against you. I....”

Yang Ye waved his hand, “Cut the crap. I can go back and be the pavilion master again. But I have a condition. From now onward, my decisions are final. I don’t want to hear you opposing me. Or you can leave Slayer Pavilion right now. But I think that you won’t choose to leave. However, that has nothing to do with me. Now, I’ve raised my condition. Just tell me if you agree or not.”

Qian Lankong took a deep breath and said, “Must you be so overbearing?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “Miss Qian, I was very polite before this, and I treated you as one of my own. Unfortunately, what I got in return was scorn and mocking. Now, I’ve decided to treat you in a different way. Agree to my condition and we’ll work together. Otherwise, please move aside.”

Qian Lankong said, “If the Slayer Pavilion is destroyed, then your Sword Alliance will be next!”

Yang Ye replied, “That’s my business, and it’s none of your concern.”

Qian Lankong fell silent. Meanwhile, Yang Ye added, “Actually, it’s very easy for me to take control of Slayer Pavilion. I just have to kill you. However, just as I’ve said before. You didn’t betray me, so I can’t do it. However, if you dare to lead the Slayer Pavilion to surrender to the Yuan Clan and those other powers, then trust me, I won’t hold back at all.”

Yang Ye continued, “besides that, if I wanted to sacrifice the Slayer Pavilion to take the Yuan Clan and those other powers down with it, I wouldn’t have to go to such troubles. I just have to not interfere with the matters of Slayer Pavilion and just allow it to fight them to the death.

Qian Lankong asked, “Why didn’t you explain earlier?”

“Explain?” Yang Ye laughed coldly, “Did you give me a chance? Even if I did, would you believe me? Even if you believed me once, would you believe me the next time? What about the next time after that? To be honest, I think that returning the Slayer Pavilion to you is good for both of us. I’m sure you’ve realized that I don’t have a good temper. If you and I can’t work together sincerely, then not to mention a cooperation, we might become irreconcilable enemies in the end!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye held Zi’er’s hand and moved past Qian Lankong.

“I agree!” Qian Lankong’s voice resounded from behind Yang Ye, “You’re the true pavilion master of Slayer Pavilion from now on. Your decisions and orders are final. Alright?”

Yang Ye stopped, turned around, and gazed at her, “Remember that you’re asking me to go back and be the pavilion master! Now, come with me.” As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye turned around and continued forward with Zi’er.

“Where are you going? The Slayer Pavilion....”

Qian Lankong had only spoken up to that point when Yang Ye suddenly turned around and glanced at her, “What? You’ve already forgotten what you just said?”

She glanced at him and said, “Fine, I’ll go with you!”

Yang Ye withdrew his gaze and gazed at Zi’er. Zi’er nodded slightly before she waved her hand gently, and it didn’t take long for the 3 of them and Snowy to vanish on the spot.

Yang Ye naturally intended to head back to Dark Hell Continent. He’d heard from that beautiful woman in the Yun Clan that the experts of the Qin Clan had headed to Dark Hell Continent. Moreover, it was even 2 experts. They were definitely Voiders. While the black ape was there in Doomsday City, and there was the Void Cloud Shuttle as well, but he still couldn’t really rest at ease.

Qian Lankong hesitated to speak while they traveled, “The Slayer Pavilion....”

Yang Ye asked, “Didn’t you say that you’ve ordered them to hide?”

“But....”

“There are no buts. Doing that is enough. I have even more important matters to attend to. If you’re unwilling to come, then you can head back yourself. I won’t stop you!”

Qian Lankong glanced at Yang Ye while a wisp of bitterness arose in her heart. Yang Ye’s current attitude towards her was like how he would treat a subordinate. At this moment, she understood that she was actually not friends with Yang Ye anymore. No, they weren’t even working together anymore. She was his subordinate now! Yang Ye wasn’t polite to her anymore, nor did he have any patience when dealing with her.

Who was at fault for all of this? It was naturally her fault. Actually, she’d reflected upon her actions earlier. Yang Ye didn’t owe her anything. She’d saved Yang Ye, but Yang Ye had saved her too. So, they didn’t owe each other anything. But she frequently acted haughtily, and she mocked him and expressed scorn towards him. Moreover, she was especially fond of talking about Yang Ye’s thoughts and actions....

People had to respect each other to get along with each other. There were limits. But she didn’t grasp those limits well, and that was why she was in an embarrassing position now.

...

Dark Hell Continent. Doomsday City.

A violet robed old man and a middle aged man appeared in the sky above the city.

2 Voiders!

The violet robed old man looked at the city below them and spoke indifferently, “Just destroy it!”

Suddenly, the space in front of the middle aged man rippled, and a short while passed before he gazed at the old man, “Father, Senior Yuan sent you a voice transmission. He wants us to return immediately because Yang Ye might have returned to the continent.”

“How laughable!” The violet robed old man spoke coldly, “He wants us to return because an ant at the Quasi Emperor Realm has returned to the continent? Even if he doesn’t mind losing face, I, Qin Xiao, prefer to maintain my dignity. Tell him that if Yang Ye returns, then I, Qin Xiao, will deal with Yang Ye as well!”

The middle aged man hesitated for a moment before he nodded, and then he withdrew a transmission talisman and crushed it.

The space before Senior Yuan suddenly rippled. A short while passed before Senior Yuan shook his head and spoke softly, “Moron!”
