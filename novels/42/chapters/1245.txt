Chapter 1246 – We Just Want To Live!

Yang Ye was naturally still himself. Not to mention that the old man had been a Voider once, even if he was a Voider now, Yang Ye would still not fear having his body seized.

Take over his body?

The old man was courting death! The tiny vortex had fused with his body, so taking over his body was equivalent to going against the tiny vortex. It wouldn’t be something terrifying while his enemies were in the outside world, but even a few Voiders would be helpless if they entered his body!

The others exchanged glances and were slightly hesitant upon hearing Yang Ye.

Yang Ye frowned, “Do all of you want to go out or not?”

The one-armed man hesitated for a moment and said, “Senior Brother, we naturally do. But Emperor Rank swords....”

Yang Ye replied, “You’ll just be borrowing it to me, and I’ll give it back to all of you once we’ve left this place!”

They instantly heaved sighs of relief, and the one-armed man smiled, “Senior Brother, you should have said that earlier. I’d thought that we’d lose those swords upon setting up the formation!” As he spoke, he was the first to withdraw 2 swords.

Yang Ye glanced at them, and he noticed that both were at the Emperor Rank! He nodded slightly and looked at the others.

This time, they didn’t hesitate and handed over their swords in succession.

In just a few breaths of time, 43 swords were standing before Yang Ye, and all were at the Emperor Rank! Yang Ye felt his heart speed up as he gazed at them.

43 Emperor Rank swords!

Even though Yang Ye was very rich, he wasn’t so rich as to treat Emperor Rank treasures as pieces of scrap metal. However, it didn’t take long for him to become calm once more. He glanced at them and said, “That’s all?”

The one-armed man asked, “Is it not enough?”

Yang Ye said, “I’m just trying to take precautions. If it isn’t sufficient, then all our efforts would have been wasted.”

Meanwhile, the beautiful woman spoke abruptly, “If it’s in terms of sword formations, then our Sword God’s Palace is the greatest on the continent. But why have we never heard of that Universe Concealment Formation?”

The one-armed man and the others gazed at Yang Ye, “Right!”

Yang Ye pondered deeply for a moment before he said, “Do all of you know why he was able to attain sword intent above the Void Rank?”

The beautiful woman asked, “Why?”

Yang Ye glanced at her and said, “He has been to Godfall Mountain and obtained the founding ancestor’s inheritance. That formation was something the founding ancestor got from outside our world. However, the founding ancestor hadn’t left it behind in Sword God’s Palace.”

“So that’s why!” She nodded slightly and said, “I was wondering how he broke through the Void Rank, so he obtained the founding ancestor’s inheritance. But that would make him the founding ancestor’s disciple, yet we....”

“Fool!” The one-armed man suddenly shouted coldly, “So what if he was the founding ancestor’s successor? What does that have to do with us? Presently, the Sword God’s Palace only exists in name, and we can’t even protect ourselves, so why should we care about his successor?”

“Senior Brother Leng Yan is right!” One of the sword cultivators by the one-armed man’s side spoke, “Presently, surviving is the most important to us. As for the founding ancestor’s successor, it has nothing to do with us.”

Leng Yan added, “Once we leave this place, we’ll definitely be able to gain supremacy over the continent with the strength we possess.”

He glanced at the others before he continued, “However, the important matter at hand is to leave this place. So, if you have more swords, then hand them over. Our senior brother isn’t going to take your swords for himself, so it’s pointless to continue hiding them.”

The others nodded slightly when they heard Leng Yan, and it didn’t take long for 5 more Emperor Rank swords to appear before Yang Ye.

Yang Ye waved his right hand and put the swords away before he said, “Violet crystals!”

Since they’d given him their swords, they naturally wouldn’t try to conceal their violet crystals, and they immediately gave him everything they had.

Yang Ye glanced at it, and there were over 10,000. He glanced at them and said, “It’s too little!”

Leng Yan asked, “Over 10,000 are still too little?”

Yang Ye nodded, “This is no ordinary formation. It was created by an ancient sword cultivator from outside our world. The founding ancestor wouldn’t have learned it if it could be set up with ease.”

He glanced at them and continued, “Stop hiding it. Wouldn’t we have as many as we want once we leave this place?”

Leng Yan turned around and glanced at the others, but they shook their heads.

Yang Ye frowned. Meanwhile, the beautiful woman suddenly said, “Don’t we have an Energy Convergence Formation? It has over 30,000 violet crystals within it. That should be enough, right?”

Yang Ye blinked and said, “Right, how could I have forgotten that. It should be enough if we use all the violet crystals in the Energy Convergence Formation!”

One of the sword cultivators said, “But if we take them, then the formation will vanish. At that time, the spirit energy in this area will become scarce.”

“Fool!” Leng Yan said, “We’re leaving, so why would we need that formation? Let’s go extract the violet crystals in that formation!” As he spoke, Leng Yan led all the others away.

Only Yang Ye, Yun Banqing, and the beautiful woman remained.

The beautiful woman glanced at Yang Ye and smiled, “Senior Brother, congratulations on obtaining new life and such an outstanding body.”

Yang Ye glanced at her and said, “Junior Sister, what are you trying to say?”

She smiled and said, “With the strength you possess, you’ll definitely be able to reign supreme over the entire continent once you leave this place. At that time, please take good care of your junior sister!”

Yang Ye smiled, “Of course!”

The beautiful woman grinned, and then she walked over to Yun Banqing, “Senior Brother, I can’t wait any longer. So let me take her body now!”

As she spoke, she was about to act, but Yang Ye suddenly said, “Wait!”

She turned to look at Yang Ye, “What? Senior Brother, have you taken a liking to her?”

Yang Ye walked over to Yun Banqing and pinched her chin before he smiled, “She’s drop dead gorgeous, so how could I not be tempted?”

He turned around to look at the beautiful woman again and said, “So, wait a little while before you take her body. Otherwise, I wouldn’t be able to do anything once you have. Right?”

Yun Banqing glanced at Yang Ye and didn’t speak a single word.

The smile on her face stiffened slightly when she heard Yang Ye, but it didn’t take long for her to return to normal. She gazed at Yang Ye for a few breaths of time before she smiled, “So that’s why... that’s why.... Since Senior Brother wants her, then I’ll wait a while. Right, I’ll go help Senior Brother Leng Yan and the others!”

As soon as she finished speaking, she turned around and walked away.

Suddenly, Yun Banqing said, “Stop her! She has seen through you.”

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly, and then Rebirth Rank sword intent appeared out of thin air and instantly held the beautiful woman on the spot.

“You really aren’t my senior brother!” She took a deep breath and turned around to look at Yang Ye, “Why? Why did he fail?”

Yang Ye glanced at her but didn’t answer her. He turned around to look at Yun Banqing instead and said, “How did you find out?”

“When you stopped Leng Yan!” Yun Banqing said, “Your eyes as well. Your eyes are filled with confidence, and it’s something that old man didn’t have. Besides that, it’s the feeling you give me, you feel like you have no ill intent towards me.”

Yang Ye rubbed his nose, “I thought I’d deceived you. Looks like I failed completely.” He turned around to look at the beautiful woman in palace attire and continued, “What about you? How did you see through me?”

She pondered deeply for a short while before she said, “I just suspected you slightly in the beginning. Because your tone was different than my senior brother. So, I decided to test you.”

Yang Ye replied, “You said you wanted to take her body just to test me?”

She nodded slightly, “Sure enough, you stopped me, and the reason was actually because you wanted to do her....”

“Can you watch your manners when speaking?” Yang Ye was slightly displeased, “You’re a woman, yet you speak so shamelessly. Is that really good?” He didn’t care, and he mainly said that because he was worried that Yun Banqing would feel embarrassed.

She glanced at Yun Banqing and said, “She isn’t yours?”

Yang Ye said, “Tell me how you saw through me! I’m really quite curious about the answer.”

She replied, “The reason I was so sure is because my senior brother has never lusted for women!”

Yang Ye’s face froze, and a short while passed before he shook his head, “I never expected that to be the problem.”

She spoke in a low voice, “Why did my senior brother fail?”

Yang Ye gazed at her and replied, “I think that you should be more concerned about yourself.”

She looked him in the eyes and was about to speak when Leng Yan and the others suddenly walked in. Leng Yan withdrew a spatial ring and said, “There are a total of over 30,000 violet crystals in here. Coupled with the violet crystals from before, there are over 40,000. Senior Brother, start setting up the formation!”

As he spoke, he passed the spatial ring to Yang Ye.

After he passed the spatial ring to Yang Ye, Leng Yan chuckled and said, “Senior Brother, you set up the formation while I take good care of that little girl. Junior Brother can’t restrain myself anymore.”

As he spoke, he shot towards Yun Banqing and intended to grab her.

Yun Banqing gazed calmly at Leng Yan. It was as if she was looking at a dead man.

Om!

Suddenly, a ray of light flashed, and then Leng Yan’s figure froze on the spot.

Everyone here was shocked.

Leng Yan turned around to gaze at Yang Ye, “You... you aren’t my senior brother....”

As soon as he finished speaking, Leng Yan’s head tilted to the side and dropped to the ground while a pillar of blood shot up into the air....

“You....” The others gazed at Yang Ye with horror. Besides horror, there was rage in their eyes as well. But none of them dared to attack because sword intent above the Void Rank could fully suppress them.

Yang Ye looked up at them. Meanwhile, the beautiful woman suddenly walked over to him and said, “We’ve been trapped here for too long. It has been so long that we don’t even remember how many years it has been. We just want to live! We just want to leave this place!”Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m
