Chapter 2392 – Three Breaths of Time are Over!

Ye Xiaotian was stunned.

“How dare you!” Ye Tianxing howled with fury, and then a powerful aura slammed down at the black robed man.

“The Limitbreaker Realm!” The black robed man’s voice had a trace of disdain in it as he waved his right hand.

Bang!

The hall exploded apart while Ye Tianxing was blasted backward.

The explosion alarmed the entire North Charge Sect.

Countless disciples looked toward the hall.

Ye Tianxing gazed at the black robed man with astonishment, “The Two World Realm, you’re a Two World expert!”

The black robed man walked slowly in Ye Tianxing’s direction, “I’ll ask one last time. Where did Yang Ye go? If you don’t give me an answer in three breaths of time, then this sect will be the tomb of everyone here!”

Li Yuan was about to say something when Ye Tianxing suddenly shook his head, “Brother Li Yuan, don’t believe him. He won’t spare us regardless of what we tell him!”

“As expected of a sect’s master!” The black robed man spoke coldly, “You understand things well. However, while the outcome is still death, I can give you a quicker death!”

Ye Tianxing laughed bitterly, “Just because we know Yang Ye?”

“Yes!” The black robed man said, “Anyone who knows him or is linked to him must die.”

Ye Tianxing was puzzled, “Why?”

The man suddenly said, “Three breaths of time have passed!”

He raised both his hands before him. In an instant, the entire North Charge Sect shook, and an invisible wave of pressure enveloped it!

A Two World Realm expert!

Despair covered their faces!

The black robed man suddenly lifted his right hand, “A bunch of ants!”

He was about to push his hand down once he finished speaking. However, he suddenly turned around, and he saw a ray of light descend from the sky. A moment later, it arrived before him. He was shocked and raised his right hand to stop it!

Bam!

A sword appeared at the center of his palm, a sword that emanated sword energy!

The black robed man held onto the sword with everything he had, and a solemn expression filled his eyes.

Suddenly, the sword shook violently.

Bang!

The black robed man was blasted over 1km away. As soon as he stopped himself, the sword shot forward again, and it was so fast that everyone here could only see a ray of light flash!

A vicious glow flashed through the black robed man’s eyes. He raised both his hands, and a blood red shield immediately appeared before him and obstructed Yang Ye’s sword!

A Pseudo Divine Treasure!

However, Yang Ye’s Sword Precursor had become a Divine Treasure. So, as soon as they collided, the shield started cracking apart. The black robed man was shocked and hurriedly shot backward while putting the shield away.

Meanwhile, a man appeared before him.

It was Yang Ye, of course!

Ye Tianxing and Li Yuan heaved sighs of relief when they saw Yang Ye because a Two World Realm expert wasn’t an existence they could resist.

Yang Ye glanced at Ye Xiaotian’s ghastly pale face, and then his own expression instantly turned icy cold. He issued a command in his heart and sent her into the Primordial Pagoda. Without Primordial Violet Energy, she would die within 10 minutes!

Yang Ye looked up at the black robed man, “The Freedom Sect? Longevity Sect? Creation Sect? Immortality Sect? Or Guardians?”

The black robed man didn’t say anything. He just turned around with the intent to leave, but a ray of sword energy suddenly appeared before his forehead!

A flying sword!

The black robed man was shocked, and he hurriedly flashed away from this lethal strike.

Suddenly, Yang Ye appeared before him, and then Yang Ye drew his sword!

The black robed man’s expression changed drastically, and he used the blood red shield again while his profound energy surged madly into it.

The sword descended.

Bang!

An explosion resounded, and the shield exploded apart while the black robed man was blasted away.

Meanwhile, a ray of light suddenly shot out of the Sword Gourd!

Bang!

The black robed man was blasted away, and an arm of his vanished.

He’d just stopped himself in midair when a sword immediately arrived before his forehead!

The black robed man cracked a smile, “Amazing, truly amazing. I didn’t expect you to have grown so strong. Even a Two World Realm expert is nothing before you! We underestimated you, we really underestimated you!”

Yang Ye walked over to him, “Which power are you from?”

The man grinned, “Why? Want to annihilate us? It’s fine. Even if you don’t go to them, they will come for you!”

Boom!

As soon as he finished speaking, his body exploded apart, and then a shadow vanished into the sky.

He'd fled with just his soul!

The black robed man knew he was no match for Yang Ye, so he’d decisively chosen to abandon his body and flee with his soul in order to give himself a chance at survival.

However, how could Yang Ye possibly allow that to happen?𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

At the instant the black robed man’s soul escaped, the Sword Gourd on Yang Ye’s waist shook, and then a ray of light vanished into the sky.

A shrill cry resounded from far away.

Swoosh!

A ray of light entered into the Sword Gourd!

Yang Ye put his sword away and looked at Ye Tianxing and LI Yuan, “Sorry for causing trouble for you!”

Ye Tianxing laughed bitterly, “Young Brother Yang, is Xiaotian alright?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “She’s fine.”

He glanced at the sky and continued, “I didn’t expect them to even refuse to spare all of you. I’m sorry. If this happens again, just tell them where I am.”

Ye Tianxing was slightly hesitant, “But…”

Yang Ye smiled, “It’s fine. They aren’t existences all of you can deal with. So, just let them come to me.”

Ye Tianxing hesitated for a moment and nodded. Just as Yang Ye had said, those powers that had enmity with Yang Ye weren’t existences that their sects could offend.

Yang Ye brought Ye Xiaotian out of the Primordial Pagoda, and her arms were healed. She gazed at him, “He was going to kill us just because we knew you?”

Yang Ye spoke softly, “Sorry!”

It really was his fault because he’d brought calamity to them!

She shook her head slightly, “It’s not your fault, it’s theirs. They just do as they wish. The lives of the weak are nothing to them!”

She suddenly looked up at Yang Ye and continued, “In the future, I’ll target and kill people like them!”

Yang Ye was stunned speechless.

Her eyes were filled with determination.

Yang Ye glanced at her and smiled, “Then work hard. After all, that guy was very strong.”

She nodded, “I’ll work hard! I definitely will!”

Yang Ye smiled, “Once you have sufficient strength, don’t forget to visit me in Eternal Border.” He gazed at Ye Tianxing and Li Yuan, and then he flicked a talisman over to them, “If someone comes here again, then feel free to tell them where I am. If they still insist on acting against you, then crush this talisman, and I’ll get here as soon as possible!”

Actually, he was aware that he was being followed, and the only reason he hadn’t killed that person was because he couldn’t be bothered too. Moreover, he was well aware that if he killed one, another would come. If that continued, it would just be a waste of time. However, he noticed that person hadn’t followed him when he left North Charge Sect. He knew that the expert following him may act against North Charge Sect, and so he immediately turned back. Sure enough, it had occurred.

If he’d been just a little later, then the North Charge Sect would probably cease to exist!

A protection talisman!

Ye Tianxing naturally didn’t refuse it, and he took it and said, “Thank you!”

Yang Ye nodded, and then he vanished into the sky.

Ye Xiaotian looked up at the sky with slight envy, “Father, he’s so strong. He killed that guy with just two attacks. Oh, right, that gourd wasn’t bad. Father, get me one too!”

Ye Tianxing rolled his eyes. It wasn’t bad? That was a Divine Treasure! It was impossible to get one even if he sold his entire sect!

Not long after Yang Ye left, an old man appeared here.

Ye Tianxing and the others seemed like they were facing a formidable enemy when they saw him.

The old man glanced at the surroundings, “Where’s the corpse?

Ye Tianxing waved his right hand, and the black robed man’s corpse appeared before the old man. Ye Tianxing hadn’t destroyed it.

The old man scanned the corpse and asked, “How many attacks did it take him?”

Ye Tianxing hesitated for a moment and said, “I think it was three!”

Three attacks!

The old man closed his eyes slowly.

A Two World Realm expert had been killed with just three attacks!

Such strength surpassed his expectations!

A short while passed before the old man asked, “Where is he going?”

Ye Tianxing told the truth, “The Divine Martial Sect!”

“Xiao Shenwu!” The old man frowned and looked at the sky, “Is Xiao Shenwu the founding ancestor of the Divine Martial Sect?”

Ye Tianxing confirmed, “Yes!”

The old man suddenly chuckled, “Interesting. According to my knowledge, Xiao Shenwu seems to be quite interested in that Sprite Progenitor too!”

The old man vanished on the spot.

Ye Tianxing heaved a sigh of relief.

Not every expert was fond of bullying the weak for fun!

Around an hour later, Yang Ye descended to the ground, and a huge ancient city stood before him.

Divine Martial City!

Yang Ye looked up at the sky, “An Nanjing, where are you?”
