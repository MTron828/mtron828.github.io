Chapter 2734 – I’d Rather Die!

He was no match for it!

Yang Ye puckered his lips.

Can’t you say that in a nicer way?

Yang Ye shook his head and felt that it was quite a pity. It had been the best opportunity to kill First God and the others, but he’d missed the opportunity.

It was such a pity!

Meanwhile, Yang Busi suddenly said, “Is the Yang Clan really as you said?”

Yang Ye gazed at her and nodded, “More or less.”

She closed her eyes slowly, and a long time passed before she spoke softly, “All that matters is it still exists!”

Yang Ye asked, “Are you coming back with me?”

Yang Busi fell silent for a short while and shook her head.

Yang Ye asked, “Why?”

She replied softly, “Countless years have passed, and it isn’t the same Yang Clan I once knew anymore. I don’t know anyone there. Returning there would be a familiar yet unfamiliar experience, and I don’t like that. Of course, I’m still a member of the Yang Clan.”

Yang Ye fell silent.

The past and the present Yang Clan were definitely different to her.

However, he could sense that she still really cared about the clan.

Yang Busi looked up and said, “I have to go.”

“Go?” Yang Ye was slightly stunned and asked, “To the border of the Four Dimensional Universe?”

She replied indifferently, “How can I not avenge the fact that I was sealed until now? I’ll tear that woman apart!”

Obviously, she was speaking about the strongest form of Destiny!

Besides the strongest form of Destiny, there was probably no one else who could suppress and seal Yang Busi for so many years.

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and added, “It’s best if you don’t act rashly!”

Yang Busi was very strong, and he’d experienced her strength.

But the strongest form of Destiny was definitely stronger. She was an existence who’d reigned supreme over the ages and casted a shadow over countless geniuses!

Yang Busi glanced at Yang Ye, “You don’t think I can defeat her?”

Yang Ye nodded in a very direct manner.

Flattery depended on the target, and Yang Busi was absolutely not someone who was fond of that.

Yang Busi nodded slightly while a trace of admiration appeared in her eyes, “You’re right, I am no match for her. However, should I avoid fighting her just because I can’t win?”

She looked up at the sky, “At most times, strength isn’t gained by cultivating, it’s gained by fighting.”

Fighting!

Yang Ye seemed to be lost in thought as he pondered on what she said.

Yang Busi glanced at Yang Ye and said, “Your bloodline is scarce, and you’ve reversed your bloodline in the past. You’re not a core disciple of the Yang Clan!”

Yang Ye nodded, “My ancestor was someone who left the clan.”

He gazed at her and continued, “Does the Yang Clan judge people by bloodline?”

She gazed at him for a short while and chuckled. Her laughter resounded like a thunderclap through the sky.

Yang Ye felt speechless. Her laughter was a little too loud, and it even caused sharp pain in his ears.

Yang Busi chuckled for a while and smiled, “My Yang Clan naturally doesn’t judge people based on bloodline, we judge people based on strength.”

She flicked a pair of violet gold bracers to Yang Ye.

The bracers flickered with a dark glow.

“What are these?” Yang Ye gazed at her with a puzzled expression on his face. However, he’d taken the bracers as he spoke.

She spoke indifferently, “Do you know what they are?”

Yang Ye shook his head.

Yang Busi smiled, “Heavenshield!”

Yang Ye had a curious expression on his face, “Heavenshield?”

Yang Busi replied, “It can even stop heaven. Of course, heaven here represents Destiny. Unless Destiny’s sword is whole again, that trash sword of hers, Justice, can’t break through it. Moreover, it has no limit when combined with our Yang Clan’s bloodline!”

Yang Ye was delighted when he heard this!

Meanwhile, Yang Busi doused him with a bucket of cold water, “Of course, based on your strength, she can kill you even if she’s using a stick.”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

Yang Busi glanced at Heavenshield, “The entire Yang Clan came together to make that, and it represents the clan’s patriarch. You’ll truly be the Yang Clan’s patriarch now that you have that.”

Yang Ye spoke solemnly, “You’re leaving?”

Yang Busi nodded, “There are things I must get even for. As for the Yang Clan, it has you. Even if it can’t return to its former prime, it won’t be bullied.”

Yang Ye laughed bitterly, “You really think highly of me!”

He was even planning to make her help him with the End World!

Yang Busi didn’t say anything else. She turned around and left once she was done.

Yang Busi looked up at the sky, “Where is the end of the boundless path of cultivation, perhaps Destiny will be the end of it. She is a mountain that none of our era could get through, and if I can’t get through her, I would rather die at her hands! Haha!”

A figure shot up into the air while accompanied by roaring and unrestrained laughter, and it shot straight into the sky!

Yang Ye remained silent.

Yang Busi!Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

A peerless expert of the Yang Clan! Seeing was believing it!

At this moment, Yang Ye felt quite a bit of admiration for this ancestor he’d just gained out of nowhere. Actually, he could imagine the helplessness or even sorrow the people of that era felt!

Because they were born in the same era as Destiny!

He’d met all four forms of Destiny.

All of them were very strong, and he wasn’t confident in defeating any one of them. As for the strongest form of Destiny, her main body was even more terrifying. After all, the four of them were separate and hadn’t merged into one!

If they merged into one and converged their strength, how terrifying would they be?

He was truly insignificant when compared to them!

Yang Ye suddenly started laughing some time later.

Weak!

He’d always admitted that he was weak, and being weak wasn’t terrifying. It was terrifying to be unaware of one’s own weakness and even think one is actually strong!

Of course, he wasn’t very weak now!

Yang Ye chuckled and returned to the Primordial Pagoda.

At this moment, Snowy was playing around with Heavenshield.

She wanted to wear it, but her paws were too small.

Snowy blinked when she saw Yang Ye, and then she gazed at Yang Ye and passed the bracer to him. Yang Ye stretched out his hands, and it instantly appeared on his arms!

In an instant, Yang Ye’s body sank down!

It was so heavy!

That was what Yang Ye felt!

At the same time, Yang Ye noticed that his blood was flowing rapidly through his arms, and then an unprecedented strength gradually appeared in his arms.

It enhanced his strength!

Yang Ye glanced at his arms. At this moment, he felt like he had the strength to challenge anything!

But just a moment later, he eliminated those unrealistic thoughts.

Yang Ye clenched his fists slowly. In an instant, the space around him cracked open, and the cracks spread rapidly in all directions. In just an instant, a huge area of space around him was covered in spider web-like cracks!

Yang Ye was shocked by this, and he hurriedly relaxed his fists. Meanwhile, Snowy waved her paw, and the space returned to normal. Meanwhile, her gaze fell on the bracers.

She was very curious. Or it should be said that she’d taken a liking to it!

Recently, she had become very fond of forging divine treasures and doing things like that. All of these divine treasures underwent a qualitative transformation in her hands!

For example, the armor Yang Ye was wearing wasn’t the same armor it used to be.

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and started circulating his blood.

His bloodline!

Yang Busi had said that it would grow even more terrifying with the help of the Yang Clan’s bloodline!

It was a treasure the entire Yang Clan had come together to forge just for Yang Busi, but it could also be considered as a treasure for the Yang Clan’s experts as only experts of the Yang Clan could truly bring forth its potential!

As his blood circulated, Yang Ye noticed the bracers started to tremble, and a moment later, Heavenshield emanated a blood red glow. At the same time, the space around Yang Ye instantly turned ethereal!

Suddenly, a small pagoda appeared on Yang Ye’s shoulder, and it kept knocking his shoulder…

It was the Primordial Pagoda, of course!

Yang Ye immediately stopped because if this continued, the space around him would be completely obliterated.

Yang Ye was extremely shocked as he gazed at the pair of bracers!

They were absolutely terrifying!

Yang Ye issued a command in his heart, and they immediately vanished as if they’d merged into his arms!

Snowy blinked. She felt they were amazing!

She gazed at Yang Ye and stretched out her paw!

Yang Ye hadn’t even reacted to her when the bracers automatically flew into her grasp!

Yang Ye asked curiously, “What are you planning on doing?”

Snowy pointed at the bracers and struck them lightly. She was saying that she planned to modify them and make them even stronger!

Yang Ye chuckled as he felt that Snowy was like a blacksmith now!

Yang Ye would naturally not object to it. Because Snowy was a truly amazing little blacksmith, and he was certain that Heavenshield would definitely grow much more formidable in her hands!

Yang Ye didn’t disturb Snowy and just left the Primordial Pagoda.

At the 9th layer of space, Yang Ye looked up at the sky. The boundless border of the Four Dimensional Universe was right up there.

After a moment of silence, Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings and vanished on the spot.

A short while later, he found a relatively safe place and returned to the Primordial Pagoda.

Yang Ye sat cross-legged in the cultivation room.

Cultivate!

Both An Nanjing and him were cultivating right now! They planned to seize this opportunity to attain the limits of the Destiny Realm!

The End World wasn’t their only enemy, and they had to look further into the future!

In the Primordial Pagoda, Snowy started to modify Heavenshield. In the beginning, Heavenshield had been absolutely willing to let her do so because it wanted to get close to her, but as time passed, it realized that the little fellow was just doing it blindly!

Heavenshield wanted to resist, but it gave up in the end!

It realized that there were so, so many on par with it in this place.

For example, those swords of Destiny, Snowy’s Sprite Staff, and Snowy’s stare too. If she stared at it and it didn’t do as she wanted, the consequences were absolutely severe!

Just like that, time trickled by in the Primordial Pagoda…
