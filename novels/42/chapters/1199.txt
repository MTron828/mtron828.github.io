Chapter 1200 – WatChapter Me!

Annihilate Doomsday City! Crush the Dark Sky Sect!

All of their hearts shook. They knew that a change to the powers of the continent was coming.

None of them objected, nor did any of them dare to object. They set out for Doomsday City under Yang Ye’s lead.

“Isn’t it a little too rushed?” Ye Liuyun spoke softly by Yang Ye’s side. She hadn’t raised any questions when Yang Ye made the decision earlier. It was a smart move. Because she could ask as she pleased in private and even object to Yang Ye’s decisions. However, she knew very well what she had to do in public. She couldn’t damage Yang Ye’s prestige, nor did she dare to do so!

Yang Ye shook his head slightly, “Our morale is at its peak, so it’s the most suitable moment to attack. Moreover, there’s no difference between being hasty or not. Because Doomsday City isn’t a threat to us anymore. Right, get ready for the Sword Alliance to move into Doomsday City once we’ve annihilated them. Cloudfall City’s location is too remote and it’s too small, it isn’t suitable for the Sword Alliance to grow. Doomsday City just happens to be barely enough.”

Ye Liuyun replied, “I’ve already planned everything!”

“Huh?” Yang Ye turned around to gaze at her, and there was a trace of surprise in his eyes, “You’ve planned everything?”

Ye Liuyun gently combed her hair behind her ears and spoke softly, “Just as you’ve said, Cloudfall City’s location is too remote and it’s too small. Moreover, it isn’t suitable for spirit veins to grow. So, if our Sword Alliance intends to grow stronger, then it must move somewhere else. Doomsday City is naturally the most suitable place for that.”

Yang Ye asked, “So, you’d planned it in advance, right?”

She nodded in response, “I’ve gained a clear understanding of everything in Doomsday City, and I have completed a string of plans as well. So long as we conquer Doomsday City, I’ll be able to arrange everything as soon as possible!”

Yang Ye gazed at her for a short while and said, “Miss Ye, I’m really lucky to have you!” If he didn’t have Ye Liuyun, then it would be absolutely impossible for the Sword Alliance to be managed in such an orderly manner.

Ye Liuyun spoke softly, “Actually, I’m lucky to have you as well!”

Both of them exchanged glances and smiled. Words weren’t needed to express their feelings.

“Boss!” Meanwhile, Huan Kong suddenly walked over to Yang Ye’s side and said, “Err, that sword technique you executed earlier was so cool, so very cool! Err, right. Lin Fan wants to learn it, and he asked me to help him ask you if you’re willing to teach it to us?”

“What nonsense!” Meanwhile, Lin Fan who’d been paying attention to what was going on here had instantly exploded with rage, “You wanted to learn it yet are using my name! How shameless are you?”

Huan Kong glanced at Lin Fan and spoke indifferently, “Do you dare to say that you don’t want to learn it?”

Lin Fan was speechless.

Yang Ye glanced at them and said, “All of you want to learn that technique?”

All of them hurriedly nodded, even Lin Fan.

Yang Ye nodded, “I can teach it to all of you. But I have conditions.”

Huan Kong quickly asked, “What conditions?”

Yang Ye replied, “In the future, the Sword Alliance will implement a point system. Want treasures? Sword techniques? Exchange points for them. As for how to obtain those points, it’s very simple. Just complete missions for the Sword Alliance or exchange other treasures for points. Besides that, I’ll establish a Sword Rankings, and it’ll only have 10 spots on it. Those in the top 10 will gain a certain amount of points every month. In short, I’ll get Miss Ye to deal with the details of the point system!”

Ye Liuyun glanced at him and nodded slightly. Everyone felt that Yang Ye was an impulse and brainless person, but she felt that Yang Ye was actually very smart on many occasions. Just like what had just happened. He hadn’t just taught them his sword technique. After all, others would never cherish things they obtained without contributing anything. Moreover, if that continued for long, they would feel like it was a matter of course.

But by carrying out the point system, it made things simpler. If one wanted something, one would have to pay for it with points! If one wanted to accumulate points, then one had to work for the Sword Alliance or ascend the Sword Rankings. It could be said that the point system had eliminated many future problems and motivated the Sword Alliance’s members.

Huan Kong and the others nodded to display their agreement once they heard Yang Ye. They were smart people, so they naturally understood Yang Ye’s intentions.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly said, “We’re here!”

All of them looked up and a huge city had appeared within their fields of vision.

Ye Liuyun spoke softly, “See those turrets on the city walls? Those are Plasma Turrets that Doomsday City obtained from an ancient ruin. It’s extremely strong and capable of posing a threat to Emperors.”

Yang Ye looked over and saw 5 such turrets on Doomsday City.

Yang Ye’s figure flashed up into the sky above the city. Meanwhile, an old man shot out of the city. It was the same old man who’d fled before Yang Ye a while ago.

The old man spoke in a low voice, “What’s the meaning of this?”

“What’s the meaning of this?” Yang Ye chuckled, “Are you joking? What do you think I’m here for?”

The old man spoke with a gloomy expression on his face, “Do you really want to fight until both our forces are destroyed?”

“Both our forces are destroyed? Can you even do that?” Yang Ye gazed at the old man and said, “Let me make this short. Those who surrender will be spared; as for those who refuse to surrender, I’ll kill every single one of them. If none agree to surrender, then I’ll slaughter the entire city!”

He intends to slaughter the city!

The old man’s expression changed. It wasn’t just the old man, the expressions of the members of the Sword Alliance had changed slightly as well. However, they didn’t say anything. Dark Hell Continent was a dog eat dog world. Since they’d been able to live until now, they were absolutely not pedantic fellows.

The old man fell silent for a long time before he spoke, “It was my Doomsday City’s mistake, and we’re willing to apologize and compensate you.”

Yang Ye walked towards the old man and said, “Do you not understand what I just said?”

As Yang Ye moved closer to the old man, a terrifying pressure instantly forced the old man to take successive steps back.

The old man was shocked. He hurriedly spoke when he noticed that Yang Ye seemed to be about to attack, “You can’t destroy the order here!”

Yang Ye stopped and asked, “Order? What order?”

The old man heaved a sigh of relief, “The 6 great powers are the publicly acknowledged Diamond Rank powers of the continent. For the sake of preventing large scale wars on the continent, the World Devastator Cult decreed that the various large powers of the continent are prohibited from fighting and killing each other. That’s why even if conflict has arisen incessantly amongst us, we haven’t ever gone to war. If you dare to destroy my Doomsday City today, then it’s equivalent to challenging the order created by the World Devastator Cult, and destroying that order is equivalent to provoking the World Devastator Cult!”

“He’s not lying!” Meanwhile, Dugu Jian suddenly walked over to Yang Ye’s side, “But there’s something he failed to mention. The other 5 powers have to give violet crystals to the World Devastator Cult. Even though all of them are Diamond Rank powers, the World Devastator Cult is the true ‘big brother’ amongst them, and they have to act according to its will. This so-called order that the World Devastator Cult created was actually created for their own benefit. Very few people are aware of this. Even I wouldn’t be aware of it if I wasn’t the junior city governor of Violet Thistle City!”

Yang Ye asked, “You’re saying that the World Devastator Cult will help them if we try to destroy them?”

Dugu Jian nodded, “It’s very likely. Because they once said that anyone who dares to destroy the order that they created is their enemy.”

Yang Ye shook his head and said, “I don’t care about the World Devastator Cult. All I know is that Doomsday City wanted to destroy my Sword Alliance. Since Doomsday City wanted to destroy my Sword Alliance, my Sword Alliance will destroy Doomsday City. It’s just that simple. If the World Devastator Cult wants to destroy my Sword Alliance, that’s fine as well. Let them come!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye turned around and looked at the old man, “Will you surrender or not?”

“You....” The old man intended to say something, but Yang Ye shook his head instead, “It seems like you don’t want to surrender. Since you don’t, then die!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye was about to attack. But the old man was prepared, and his figure instantly vanished on the spot.

“Fire!” At the same time, a voice resounded in the air above the city.

Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!

5 enormous beams of black light surged out from Doomsday City, and its target was Yang Ye’s group.

Yang Ye swung the sword in his right hand. A ray of sword energy swept out horizontally, and the beams of black light were instantly obliterated.

A moment later, Yang Ye swung his sword again, and a ray of sword energy instantly slammed against the city’s gates.

Bang!

The city gates were instantly transformed into powder.

Yang Ye’s voice resounded, “Attack! Kill all who resist!”

The others didn’t hesitate to surge into the city.

Suddenly, a blue robed old man appeared before the entrance to the city. The old man raised his right hand slightly before slapping it down at the members of the Sword Alliance.

Bang!

The space in the area before them collapsed in an instant, and it astounded the members of the Sword Alliance.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye appeared in front of them, and then a strand of sword intent formed a barrier before them and instantly stabilized the expanse of collapsing space.

A short moment later, everything here returned to normal.

“You’re the 1st person that has dared to look down on my World Devastator Cult!” The blue robed old man gazed at Yang Ye and said, “But you do have some ability.”

Yang Ye asked, “Your World Devastator Cult intends to protect Doomsday City?”

The blue robed old man said, “The order we created can’t be destroyed. So, Doomsday City can’t be destroyed!”

“Watch me!” As soon as Yang Ye finished speaking, he transformed into a ray of light that shot forward. At the same time, his voice resounded once more, “Attack! Kill any who dare to fight back!”

“How dare you!” The old man roared with fury and was about to attack. However, a terrifying force pressed down upon him and caught him off guard, causing him to be almost pressed down to his knees!

“Sword intent above the Void Rank!” The old man was shocked. However, a sword had pressed against the center of his forehead at the exact same moment. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

The old man gazed at Yang Ye with astonishment, “You... your sword intent is actually above the Void Rank!”

Yang Ye said, “I don’t want to become enemies with the World Devastator Cult!”

The old man immediately said, “I don’t think you would even dare to! Immediately order your forces out of Doomsday City, or....”

Hiss!

Yang Ye’s sword instantly stabbed through the old man’s head, and a string of blood sprayed out from the back of the old man’s head while his eyes swiftly opened wide.

“You think too highly of yourself!” Yang Ye’s voice resounded by the old man’s ears.
