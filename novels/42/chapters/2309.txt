Chapter 2310 – A Lot of Battle!

As time trickled by, the veins on Yang Ye’s arms started to bulge up. The energy from the Desolate Ape’s flesh had erupted within him, and Butcher was guiding them toward Yang Ye’s arms.

Yang Ye’s arms gradually started to transform.

Bai Zhixian just accompanied him in silence.

Only her presence could calm Yang Ye. Otherwise, anyone who approached him would be greeted with the Madness Saber Technique!

A long time passed before Butcher withdrew his hands.

Yang Ye’s eyes were closed tight, and his fists were clenched tight too. His arms were covered in veins that looked like countless little snakes.

Suddenly, Yang Ye opened his eyes and gazed at Butcher, and then he slammed his fists at Butcher.

Butcher seemed to have expected this. His expression didn’t change at all as he raised his hand to defend himself.

Bang!

An explosion resounded.

Bam! Bam!

Butcher took around five steps back.

As for Yang Ye, he charged forward again and slammed his fist at Butcher.

Bai Zhixian was about to stop Yang Ye, but Butcher suddenly said, “No, he needs to release the extra energy within his arms.”

Bai Zhixian hesitated for a moment and stopped on the spot.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye slammed his fists at Butcher, over and over again. Butcher didn’t counterattack and just blocked them. However, Yang Ye’s strength was truly too strong, so even Butcher couldn’t block them without being affected at all. So, Butcher was pushed back incessantly. After all, Yang Ye’s body was extremely strong, and his arms were even superior to his body’s cultivation. Thus, every single punch of his could blast space open.

Just like that, around an hour passed before Yang Ye stopped.

He was exhausted!

At this moment, he’d vented all the raging energy in his arms, and he was finally exhausted.

Butcher glanced at Yang Ye and said, “He hasn’t gotten fully used to his strength. Take good care of him. I’ll be back once he has recovered.”

Butcher turned around and left.

Bai Zhixian gazed at Yang Ye. At this moment, Yang Ye was lying on the ground, and he seemed completely exhausted.

Bai Zhixian shook her head and carried Yang Ye into the stone house. She placed him on the bed and was about to leave, but he held tightly to her hand.

Bai Zhixian was stunned. She hesitated for a moment and sat by the bed.

As she gazed at him on the bed, her eyes gradually lost focus.

A day later, Yang Ye appeared in the village with the chopper in his grasp!

The chopper!

Everyone in the village avoided him!

It didn’t take long for him to arrive at the entrance to the village. The slovenly old man had sensed Yang Ye’s aura and immediately leaped off the wooden bench. He sized up Yang Ye, and then suddenly vanished on the spot.

Seize the initiative!

It had always been Yang Ye who launched the first strike, but he wanted to do it this time!

Yang Ye suddenly raised the chopper and swung it.

The old man tapped his finger against the chopper, and then his expression changed at the instant he touched the chopper.

Bang!

Yang Ye was pushed backward repeatedly, and he only stopped after taking a few dozen steps back. As for the old man, while he hadn’t been pushed back, the space around him had cracked open. At the same time, a long cut had appeared on his finger.

He would have lost his finger if it had gone just a little deeper! 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

The old man sized up Yang Ye’s arms and said, “The Moving Mountain Realm, arms that can move a myriad of mountains!”

Yang Ye was about to attack again when Butcher and Bai Zhixian suddenly appeared in front of him.

Butcher sized up Yang Ye and smiled, “Not bad, not bad. Your control of strength is really not bad. Come, let’s go practice your saber technique. You’ll love it!”

He turned around and walked toward the rear mountains.

Bai Zhixian hesitated for a moment and led Yang Ye over.

Meanwhile, the old man appeared by Butcher’s side, “Are you sure about taking him to the rear mountains?”

Butcher nodded slightly, “Only true battle can allow him to locate the flaws in his saber technique, and only true battle can truly bring forth his potential.”

The old man spoke solemnly, “It’s dangerous!”

Butcher smiled, “I wouldn’t be taking him there if it wasn’t dangerous.” He paused for a moment and continued, “Second Brother, I’m sure you’re aware that we don’t have much time left. If we don’t make him stronger, he’ll probably be killed as soon as he heads out there.”

The old man glanced at Yang Ye and nodded, “True. Be careful then!”

Butcher nodded, and then he led Yang Ye and Bai Zhixian to the rear mountains.

It didn’t take long for them to vanish into the distance.

At the southern parts of the village, a middle aged woman stood before a bamboo house. It was Auntie Vege.

There was an old man at the entrance of the house, and it was Wang Erya’s grandfather who’d just returned from the rear mountains.

The old man glanced at her and asked, “Do you need something?”

She looked him in the eyes, “Old man, why are you doing everything you can to help that kid?”

The old man grinned, “So it’s that. Do you want the truth or a lie?”

“The truth, of course!” She continued, “If you’re willing to tell me.”

The old man glanced off into the distance, and a young girl was training with her fists there.

It was Wang Erya.

The old man replied softly, “I want her to leave this place!”

Auntie Vege’s pupils constricted, “With him?”

The old man nodded.

She clenched her fists slowly, “Why? Why did you choose him?!”

The old man shook his head, “I can’t tell you.”

She looked him in the eyes, “Why?!”

The old man shook his head slightly and entered the house.

Auntie Vege frowned on the spot, and no one knew what she was thinking.

…

The rear mountains.

As they traveled, Bai Zhixian asked, “Third Martial Uncle, what kind of place is the rear mountains?”

Butcher explained, “The rear mountains is a huge mountain behind our village. There are some powerful creatures living there. Most of them are the descendants of powerful Primal Demons from the Primal Era, and they are very strong.”

Bai Zhixian spoke solemnly, “Martial Uncle, you plan to make Yang Ye fight them?”

Butcher nodded, “They grew up here, so being able to survive proves that they are ruthless and powerful creatures. They are the best sparring partners for him. I know what you’re worried about, but if he doesn’t temper himself through battles of life and death, how will he improve himself?”

Bai Zhixian fell silent.

Butcher continued, “He needs battle now, a lot of battle.”

Butcher stopped and stated, “We’re here.”

Bai Zhixian looked up, and a dense forest was ahead of them.

Butcher picked up a rock and flicked it forward into the forest. At the same time, he waved his right hand and retreated 300m away with Bai Zhixian.

A moment of silence ensued.

Boom!

Suddenly, a wave of powerful aura rippled out from the forest, and numerous afterimages appeared before Yang Ye.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye raised his chopper and swung it!

Bang!

A figure was blasted away.

It was Yang Ye.

As soon as he descended to the ground, the ground beneath him shook violently!

A descendant of a Primal Demon that looked like a wolf stood before Yang Ye, but it was slightly different than a normal wolf. Its body wasn’t huge, but it had two sword-like horns on its head, and a very long tail.

“Skywalker Wolf!” Butcher spoke softly by Bai Zhixian’s side, “It’s extremely swift with very powerful explosive force, but its defenses are slightly weak. Of course, it still isn’t something that kid can penetrate. If he’s able to get used to its speed and explosive force, even a True Void Realm expert won’t be able to kill him in an instant. Moreover, he would even have the strength to fight them.”

Bai Zhixian nodded slightly and looked up. The Skywalker Wolf was staring at Yang Ye with a vicious glow in its eyes. It was about to attack again when Yang Ye suddenly leaped up and arrived before it, and then he swung the chopper in his grasp.

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!

Numerous horrifying hisses resounded! It was the sound of space being sliced apart!

Madness Saber Technique!

100 swings in a breath of time!

As soon as Yang Ye’s final swing descended, the Skywalker Wolf had been blasted around 300m away, and there was a mark between its horns. The mark was around half a finger deep, and it was just a mark without any blood. Because Yang Ye hadn’t been able to slice through its defenses and had merely sliced through a layer of its skin!

The wolf was furious!

A furious howl resounded, and then afterimages appeared here.

Afterimages of the Skywalker Wolf!

Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!

Explosions resounded incessantly.

Bai Zhixian’s pupils constricted slightly, and she clenched her fists.

Meanwhile, a figure was being pushed back repeatedly, and it was Yang Ye.

He was being completely crushed!

In just a short while, countless bloody marks had appeared on him!

Just like that, a few dozen breaths passed.

Bang!

Suddenly, Yang Ye’s figure was blasted away, and as soon as he slammed into the ground over 300m away, the wolf appeared above him again and slammed its figure down at him once more.

Bai Zhixian’s expression changed and was about to do something, but Butcher stopped her.

Butcher gazed coldly into the distance, “Is this wolf stronger or are his enemies in the outside world stronger?”

Bai Zhixian fell silent.

Butcher said, “We don’t have much time left. When the time comes, this place will vanish, and both of you must leave. You’ll die if you leave this place with your current strengths. So, he must…”

He suddenly stopped abruptly, and astonishment covered his face.

Bai Zhixian was stunned on the spot too.

It didn’t take long for quite an unsightly expression to appear on their faces.

The wolf was rolling on the ground while howling in pain, and Yang Ye was holding something black that was shaped like an eggplant.

Something seemed to have vanished from below the Skywalker Wolf.
