Chapter 2476 – All Living Beings are Ants!

Yang Ye had a rough understanding of everything when he heard up to this point.

The living beings of the Four-Dimensional Space, or what the world called destiny, were able to rule the fate of the living beings in the Three-Dimensional Space.

How could figures like the Desolate Emperor be willing to let others rule them and be controlled by others?

Actually, to be a little blunt, it was the control of a supreme living being over an inferior one. Just like few humans ever held any pity toward the ants and plants in this world!

Would anyone find stomping on an ant as something strange?

Of course not!

So, would the so-called destiny in the Four-Dimensional World feel sad upon killing a human? Would they care?

Was anyone willing to be controlled by someone else?

Yang Ye shook his head and restrained his thoughts. It was all too far away for him, and he wasn’t even certain if that so-called destiny still existed!

The Desolate Emperor didn’t say too much about these things and just led Yang Ye upward.

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings, “Senior, what kind of space is this?”

The Desolate Emperor replied indifferently, “The Clear Void Space!”

“The Clear Void Space?” Yang Ye was about to ask when the Desolate Emperor said, “Don’t ask. You wouldn’t understand anyone.”

The Desolate Emperor sped up once he finished speaking, and it didn’t take long for them to seem like they were at the end of the world. Pitch black lightning was frequently flashing there.

Yang Ye asked, “What’s that?”

Yang Ye felt his heart shudder as he gazed at the black lightning!

Danger!

It was his first impression!

The Desolate Emperor smiled, “Do you know what this is?”

Yang Ye shook his head.

The Desolate Emperor explained, “Darkvoid Divine Lightning, a powerful type of divine lightning that can obliterate the void! It’s an evolved form of ordinary lightning, and a single ordinary bolt of lightning takes at least 100,000 years to evolve into it! It can be said that if these bolts of lightning descended upon my desolate race, they would be able to obliterate my desolate race.”

Yang Ye gulped and asked, “Senior, you’re not planning on asking me to get hit by them, right?”

The Desolate Emperor gazed at Yang Ye, “What do you think?”

Yang Ye laughed bitterly, “Senior, are you trying to kill me?”

“Kill you?” The Desolate Emperor replied, “Would I have to go to so much trouble? I can just kill you with a single slap of my palm. This lightning is powerful, and of course, it is dangerous too. But if you let them cleanse your body, your body will definitely be strengthened tremendously, and you may even be pleasantly surprised by the results. Of course, it depends on whether you dare to!”

Yang Ye said, “Senior, the strength of this lightning has exceeded the limits of my body. Not to mention tempering me, I may be obliterated upon going in there!”

The Desolate Emperor replied, “How would you know without giving it a try?”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

The Desolate Emperor spoke indifferently, “You decide if you’ll try it or not.”

Yang Ye fell silent for a long time and said, “I will!”

As the Desolate Emperor had said, there was no need to use this to bring harm to him.

It was just lightning! There was nothing to fear!

Yang Ye took a deep breath and looked up at the lightning. He was about to head over when Erya appeared by his side.

She glanced at the lightning and gazed at the Desolate Emperor, “Uncle, can I go in there too?”

The Desolate Emperor glanced at her, “Do as you want!”

Erya nodded and gazed at Yang Ye, “Big Brother Yang, I’ll go give it a try first. Wait here for me.”

Yang Ye was about to say something when Erya tapped her foot down and shot up into the air. Suddenly, a bolt of lightning descended and slammed down upon her.

Boom!

Countless sparks flew!

Erya was blasted back to Yang Ye and the Desolate Emperor.

Her countenance was pale while arcs of electricity flickered through her, and her body was even shivering.

Yang Ye was slightly unwilling to go forward now.

What was Erya’s body like? He knew it very well, it was something that could even resist Super Divine Treasures! Yet now, the lightning had struck her to the point…

Meanwhile, Erya gasped rapidly, and then greedily sucked in a breath, “It feels so good!”

Yang Ye was stunned speechless.

After that, they watched as Erya charged over again.

Bang!

Another bolt of lightning slammed down at her, and it blasted her down.

Erya’s entire body was trembling!

But Yang Ye noticed that excitement covered her face!

Excitement!

Does she like being tortured?

Erya charged over once more.

Yang Ye gazed at the Desolate Emperor, “Senior, do you know about her?”

The Desolate Emperor replied indifferently, “I do, but I won’t tell you!”

Yang Ye’s face stiffened, “Why?”

The Desolate Emperor replied, “Because I like to keep you guessing, alright?”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

Meanwhile, Erya was blasted down again, and she charged over once more. She looked like she was in a terrible state. Her skin had split open and even her scales had started to crack while blood started to seep out!

However, Erya was growing increasingly excited!

The Desolate Emperor suddenly asked, “Do you know why?”

Yang Ye glanced at her and shook his head.

The Desolate Emperor explained, “There’s something special about this lightning, and it’s that they contain extremely pure essence of lightning. Every single time it strikes her, a part of that essence flows into her. Simply speaking, the more of that essence she absorbs, the greater her defenses will become. Once such essence enters your body, it will strengthen your skin, bones, and meridians. Understand?”

Yang Ye nodded, “I do now!”

After that, he took a deep breath and shot up into the air.

It didn’t take long for a bolt of lightning to surge down. Yang Ye felt his scalp go numb as he watched it descend, but he still braced himself and went at it.

Bang!

Yang Ye crashed down from high above.

Yang Ye laid on the expanse of space before the Desolate Emperor and trembled violently. His entire body was pitch black, his skin had cracked open, and blood was flowing.

A heavy injury!

A single bolt of lightning had cracked open Yang Ye’s body and caused his body to become numb!

It hurt!

That was what Yang Ye felt right now. He’d been struck by lightning in the past, but it was different this time. The pain came with a form of heartrending pain, and it didn’t just strike a few areas of his body, it was throughout his body!

Luckily, his body had started to heal slowly with the help of the Primordial Violet Energy.

Around an hour later, Yang Ye stood up and charged over again.

Meanwhile, the Desolate Emperor glanced at Yang Ye and Erya, and then he vanished on the spot.

A moment later, he appeared underground beneath the Northern Sword Sect, and he was before Chen Xuanan.

Chen Xuanan suddenly said, ‘You told him too much!”

The Desolate Emperor replied, “He’ll come into contact with it, sooner or later. It may not be a bad thing for him to be a little more prepared.”

Chen Xuanan nodded slightly, “Do you need something?”

The Desolate Emperor replied, “There is something.”

Chen Xuanan replied, “Go on!”

The Desolate Emperor walked to the side and spoke softly, “The ancient times was much stronger than this current civilization of the Martial Dao, right?”

Chen Xuanan nodded, “Much stronger in overall.”

The Desolate Emperor asked, “Why did it vanish?”

Chen Xuanan shook his head, “There are many reasons, like war. Many civilizations vanish amidst war. There were even more ancient civilizations before ours, but they vanished too. Just like this very moment, if your desolate race fights Eternal Kingdom to the death, it’s very likely that a few tens of thousands of years from now, no one will remember the civilization of your era.”

The Desolate Emperor smiled, “War is the culprit, but at most times, war is unavoidable.”

Chen Xuanan said, “I sense a powerful aura no weaker than yours coming from Eternal Kingdom.”Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

The Desolate Emperor said, “Everything here will be over very soon. I came here to ask if it’s really very strong?”

Chen Xuanan replied, “Strong or not, you have to go, right?”

The Desolate Emperor roared with laughter that reverberated throughout the Northern Sword Sect.

A short while later, he left.

Only Chen Xuanan remained here!

Silence filled the hall for a long time, and then a voice resounded, “All living beings are like ants.”

…

At the Clear Void Space, Yang Ye and Erya were still charging at the lightning.

Erya was in better condition. While the divine lightning still impacted her tremendously, her body was able to endure the impact! And she was forcefully enduring bolt after bolt of lightning!

But Yang Ye was different, he couldn’t endure it. Every single bolt of lightning blasted his skin and flesh open, and he had to rest for quite a long time before he could take another.

However, it was working. He could sense that something had entered his body, and he felt that he was much more resistant now!

Just like that, they were continuously struck by the lightning…

In the Primordial Pagoda.

All the demons were taking quite a bit of pleasure in this. After all, the devil, Erya, was finally being “punished”!

Erya was like an elder sister to them, but they mostly thought of her as the devil.

However, their happiness didn’t last for long because Erya suddenly entered the Primordial Pagoda and went to the Ascension Platform.

All of the demons had a bad feeling when they saw Erya’s injured body!

She glanced at them and said, “All of you come with me.”

They remained silent.

When she saw them remain still, Erya spoke coldly, “What? You think you’re stronger than me, so you don’t need to train? Right?”

All of them hurriedly shook their heads.

Erya said, “Since you’re not stronger than me, then come with me. You have no objections, right?”

At this point, she gazed at the Primal True Dragon, “Do you have any objections?”

The dragon hurriedly shook its head.

Erya gazed at Oxxy, and the latter hurriedly shook his head.

Erya gazed at the Primal Royal Crocodile next, and the latter hesitated for a moment before shaking its head.

Face? Backbone?

Once they came here, they learned something, and it was that they couldn’t care about their face. As for their backbone, trying to preserve that would only end in broken bones!

Erya nodded with satisfaction, “Alright, let’s go get struck by lightning.”

As she spoke, she left the Primordial Pagoda. In the air, Erya grunted and muttered, “Damn lightning! I’ll eat you once you’re done striking me! I wonder if I can eat you… Hmm, I’ll ask Big Brother Yang to try it first, and I’ll eat if he succeeds…”
