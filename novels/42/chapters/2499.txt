Chapter 2500 – I’ll Just Kill Them!

The middle aged man would naturally not believe the reason she gave. Of course, he didn’t dare to go confront her either. Ye Zhibei was one of the few people in this city who should not be offended!

The middle aged man glanced at the surroundings and said, “Investigate the matter.”

“Yes!” A black shadow soundlessly vanished from the corner.

The middle aged man glanced at the corpses and had quite a solemn expression on his face, “A single attack! Such sharp attacks of the sword!”

…

Once they entered the city, it didn’t take long for Li Mu to appear before them again.

Li Mu glanced at them, “Congratulations! Now, you’ve truly joined the War Dimension. I’ve sent word to your sects and clans about it! Next, you must choose an organization to join and survive.”

Xue Yiren asked, “What do you mean?”

Li Mu didn’t say anything and was about to leave, but Yang Ye flicked a World Crystal over to him.

Li Mu glanced at Yang Ye and took the World Crystal, “You should be aware that the people here are the geniuses from all the top powers throughout Eternal Kingdom. Once they arrived here, they formed their own groups. Simply speaking, this place is no different than the outside world. If you want to survive, it’s best to choose a reliable organization to join.”

Mo Ya asked, “Are there people from my Ancient Sword Sect here?”

Li Mu nodded, “According to my knowledge, there are, but very few. Moreover, they haven’t formed an organization of their own. You sword cultivators like to be on your own. Of course, the precondition is formidable strength. Otherwise, freedom? That’s only a dream!”

Li Mu was about to leave once he finished speaking, but he seemed to have thought of something and gazed at Yang Ye, “I’ll give you an extra warning, it’s best to keep a low profile while you’re new here. There is no lack of ruthless people here, and there is no lack of people with strength or formidable backgrounds.”

He turned around and left once he finished speaking.

Once Li Mu was gone, Yang Ye gazed at the others, “Do all of you have a place to go?”

They shook their heads. They were completely unfamiliar with the place!

Suddenly, a man walked over to them and smiled, “Are you new to the city?”

They gazed at him, and he smiled, “Allow me to introduce myself. I’m Xu Xian, and I’m in charge of Cloud Observation Tower’s external affairs!”

“Cloud Observation Tower?” Xue Yiren asked, “Can you tell us more?”

Xu Xian smiled, “You’re new here, so it’s normal to not know much about this place. Allow me to introduce War City to you. I’m sure you’re aware that Eternal Kingdom is divided into five regions, or five powers. They are the Ye Clan of the South, the Leng Clan of the North, the Ancient Sword Sect of the West, the Gu Clan of the East, and the Xing Clan of the Central Region. Obviously, the Xing Clan is the strongest. After all, their patriarch is our Eternal Lord.”

He paused for a moment and continued, “Besides the Ancient Sword Sect, all of the other top powers have established their own organization here. There is fighting and conflict here too. Besides these four organizations, there are other small organizations too, like my Cloud Observation Tower. We aren’t part of any of the four top organizations, we are just a group of independent cultivators.”

Independent cultivators!

Mo Ya and the others were quite tempted.

Xu Xian continued, “If I’m being honest, I came to you because no one greeted you on your arrival. If you were from those powers and their organizations, they would have sent someone to welcome you on arrival. Since no one did that, I think you’re either from the Ancient Sword Sect or independent cultivators. Since you carry swords, I’m sure it’s the former.”

Xue Yiren nodded, “We are disciples of the Ancient Sword Sect!”Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Xu Xian smiled, “Then would you be willing to join my Cloud Observation Tower?”

Mo Ya and the others exchanged glances, and then they gazed at Yang Ye.

Yang Ye smiled, “I like to be on my own!”

Xu Xian glanced at Yang Ye and said, “Allow me to be honest, it isn’t easy to survive here on your own.”

Yang Ye smiled, “It’s fine. I prefer to be on my own. I have more freedom!”

Xu Xian nodded and didn’t say anything else.

In the end, the others decided to join Cloud Observation Tower.

When they parted, Xue Yiren cupped his fist to Yang Ye, “Brother Ye, until next time!”

Yang Ye nodded, “Take care!”

Mo Ya suddenly asked, “Are you really not coming with us?”

Yang Ye shook his head. Just as he’d said, he liked being on his own because he had more freedom!

Mo Ya hesitated for a moment and nodded, “Then take care!”

They left with Xu Xian and only Yang Ye remained here.

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings, “So this is the War Dimension?”

The War Dimension!

He was very curious about this place because the main force against the desolate race was here. But he hadn’t been able to discern anything special about this place yet.

Yang Ye remained silent for a moment and then he walked off toward the streets. It didn’t take long for him to find a luxurious hotel that was very huge.

House of Indulgence.

Yang Ye walked in, and then a beautiful woman walked over. She bowed slightly to Yang Ye and asked, “May I know what you need?”

Yang Ye glanced at her and was quite surprised because she was actually a Three World Realm expert!

A Three World Realm expert!

Yang Ye sized up the woman and said, “A room, a quiet one!”

She smiled, “10 Divine Crystals per day. I’ll give you 10% off if you book the room for a month.”

10 Divine Crystals!

So 300 Divine Crystals a month, that was equivalent to 3 World Crystals!

It was such a huge profit!

Yang Ye thought for a moment and replied, “I’ll take five days!”

He flicked 50 Divine Crystals to her.

She took them and smiled, “We have standard rooms, superior rooms, and deluxe rooms. Standard rooms are 10 Divine Crystals per day, superior rooms are 15, and deluxe rooms are 30. Would you like to switch rooms?”

Yang Ye pointed at himself, “Do I look like I’m rich?”

Her smile stiffened, but it didn’t take long for her smile to return to normal, “Of course, allow me to take you to your room!”

She led Yang Ye to a room on the third floor.

Meanwhile, she suddenly asked, “Do you need a companion for mutual cultivation?”

“Huh?” Yang Ye was stunned.

She added, “Mutual Cultivation Companions. 1 World Crystal per night for an average companion, 5 World Crystals per night for a high-class companion who knows mutual cultivation techniques. There are standard companions too, they are 2 World Crystals per night. Do you need one?”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and asked, “People provide that kind of service?”

She glanced at him, “You think it’s very embarrassing?”

Yang Ye was stunned and asked, “Is it honorable?”

She replied indifferently, “Are they stealing?”

Yang Ye shook his head.

She continued, “Are they deceiving?”

Yang Ye shook his head again.

She asked again, “Are they robbing?”

Yang Ye shook his head once more.

She said, “Since they are not doing any of that, why do you think they are an embarrassment?”

Yang Ye was speechless, “I…”

She continued, “As for selling themselves, it’s their own business. I think that others should not take the moral high ground and judge them.”

Yang Ye shook his head, “You misunderstood me. I’m not looking down on them. I meant that they should be around the Four World Realm. Experts like that should have no lack of World Crystals, right?”

“Why wouldn’t they?” She replied with a question, “I’m at the peak of the Three World Realm right now. If I want to advance to the Four World Realm, I’ll need a lot of resources. If I had 40 or 50 World Crystals, I can advance at any time, but I don’t! Rob for it? Will there be a risk? The slightest mistake may cost me my life. Kill demon beasts? Are those demon beasts that easy to kill?”

She glanced at him and continued, “You don’t seem to be of ordinary background, or I should say that you should be the young master of some power. So, some things are easily within your reach, but to people without any background like us, every single step on the path of the Martial Dao takes 120% of our strength. If you need it, then let me know, and I’ll make the arrangements!”

She turned around and left once she finished speaking.

Yang Ye fell silent.

World Crystals!

At this moment, he recalled his past when he was living with his mother and sister. At that time, wasn’t he willing to do anything for a little money? But after he met Snowy, he’d never lacked resources again!

It could be said that once he met Snowy, he had Divine Treasures and World Crystals whenever he wanted them!

But it wasn’t the same for others. Perhaps just one World crystal took a very, very long time to obtain!

A long time passed before Yang Ye sighed with emotion, “I should cherish it all!”

There were things which should not be squandered upon being obtained, and they should be cherished!

And then there was Snowy too!

Needless to say, Yang Ye really missed the little fellow, and he missed the violent and aggressive Erya too. He wondered if they were causing trouble over there! An Nanjing too! He wondered how she was doing!

Yang Ye shook his head and was about to close the door so that he could cultivate in the Primordial Pagoda. However, the woman from before appeared at the door!

Yang Ye smiled, “I don’t need special services!”

She glanced at him and said, “Someone is looking for you. Allow me to be honest, they aren’t here to talk.”

They weren’t here to talk!

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly, and then he thought of something. Those people he killed outside the city! He knew that they were here for him now!

She said, “If you’re willing to take a deluxe room, then our hotel will protect you.”

Yang Ye smiled, “For how long?”

She replied indifferently, “As soon as you’re staying!”

Yang Ye shook his head, “Forget it, that’s a little expensive. I’ll just go kill them!”

Yang Ye walked out of the room as he spoke.

The woman was stunned speechless.
