Chapter 2382 – I Want to Kill!

They nodded upon hearing Li Changsheng.

The Primal Battlefield was a precious resource for all of them, and they wouldn’t allow anyone else to get a piece of it. That sword cultivator had openly destroyed their restrictions, and that was no different than a form of provocation!

They planned to make an example of him!

All of them waited quietly!

Around an hour later, a sword cultivator walked out slowly from the door.

The auras of the experts here immediately swept out, and they surged toward the sword cultivator. In an instant, the sword cultivator was trapped on the spot.

He glanced at them, “What are you doing?”

Li Changsheng walked over to him and laughed coldly, “What are we doing? Do you know that the Primal Battlefield belongs to us? Yet you destroyed the restrictions here. That’s no different than provoking us. So, what do you think we want?”

The sword cultivator glanced at Li Changsheng, “I don’t want to swing my sword!”

“Why?” Li Changsheng smiled, “You’re afraid?”

The sword cultivator shook his head, “You’re too weak. But it’s fine.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he was behind Li Changsheng, and the latter’s body had stiffened. His eyes were opened wide and filled with disbelief.

The sword cultivator didn’t say anything and just walked off slowly. It didn’t take long for him to vanish from everyone’s fields of vision.

Meanwhile, Li Changsheng’s head fell off his neck.

Blood sprayed like a fountain!

Everyone here turned ghastly pale and were petrified on the spot.

Dead!

The master of the Longevity Sect had died just like that, and they hadn’t even been able to see the sword cultivator’s attack!

Their expressions turned extremely unsightly!

They had been ignored!

The sword cultivator had ignored them. Why? Because they were too weak! Just thinking of that made their faces grow even more unsightly!

…

In the Primal Battlefield, at the peak of the gorge, Yang Ye and Nanli Meng stopped there. The Primal Vicious Tiger was in front of them.

Yang Ye gazed at Nanli Meng, “You can leave first if you’re busy!”

Nanli Meng smiled, “Since we came together, we should leave together, of course!”

Yang Ye nodded slightly, and then he entered the Primordial Pagoda.

In the cultivation room, Yang Ye sat cross-legged and withdrew the bottle of blood. He poured out a drop and swallowed it. As soon as it entered his stomach, Yang Ye felt like he’d swallowed a molten red block of metal.

It hurt!

Yang Ye hurriedly firmed his mind and started absorbing the energy within it. The energy within the blood surged incessantly through his body, and it made his body burn up!

Sword Scroll’s expression changed slightly from the sight of it. The God Blood far surpassed her expectations. Fortunately, Yang Ye had an endless supply of Primordial Violet Energy to repair his body, so it wouldn’t be destroyed by the blood in a short while.

However, Sword Scroll was still quite worried, worried that Yang Ye wouldn’t be able to hold on!

Outside the Primordial Pagoda.

Nanli Meng glanced at the Primal Vicious Tiger before her, and a smile curled up on her face. It wasn’t just vigilant toward the living beings in the surroundings, it was vigilant toward her too!

But it made sense to her. Because not to mention Yang Ye trusting her, even she didn’t truly trust Yang Ye!

They weren’t really friends yet.

In the Primordial Pagoda.

Yang Ye’s figure grew redder and redder. In the end, it was like his figure was being roasted. It was extremely horrifying.

Sword Scroll’s face was extremely solemn, and she was ready to help at any moment.

A long time passed before Yang Ye suddenly frowned because countless strands of consciousness had appeared in his mind!

Consciousness!

It didn’t take long for Yang Ye to figure out where they’d come from! It was the remnants of the consciousness of the blood’s owner!

At this moment, it was actually trying to unconsciously suppress his own consciousness!

Yang Ye was shocked and hurriedly suppressed it.

Cold sweat gradually appeared on Yang Ye’s forehead!

The consciousness’ strength far surpassed his imagination. Even if he used his full strength, he couldn’t do anything to it. Conversely, it was ceaselessly suppressing his own consciousness. If this continued, it would take control of his body!

Become another person?

Ferocity covered Yang Ye’s face when he thought of this.

He would absolutely not allow himself to become someone else!

Yang Ye’s face grew in ferocity, and in the end, it had warped.

Sword Scroll’s frown deepened from the sight of this.

A long time passed before an explosion resounded in Yang Ye’s sea of consciousness, and then blood sprayed from all 7 of Yang Ye’s apertures. However, a smile appeared on her face.

Sword Scroll had been quite shocked, but she was stunned again when she saw the smile on his face.

Suddenly, Yang Ye’s aura grew stronger and stronger, and his body was undergoing a transformation too.

A short while later, Yang Ye’s body stopped changing, but his aura was growing stronger and stronger as if it had no end to it.

Actually, his aura had surpassed the True Void Realm, and even True World Realm experts couldn’t compare to it!

Sword Scroll frowned, “He’s advancing two realms at once?”

Advancing too quickly wasn’t a good thing! The faster one advanced, the weaker one’s realm of cultivation would be. It was due to a weak foundation, and a weak foundation would make one’s cultivation crumble from the slightest impact!

Suddenly, Yang Ye’s aura grew weaker and weaker. In the end, it was no different than Yang Ye’s initial aura.

Sword Scroll’s pupils constricted slightly, “You…”

Yang Ye took a deep breath and stood up, and then he glanced at his body. At this moment, his body was no different than it had been. But his body had attained the True World Realm!

An improvement in the body!

But his cultivation hadn’t improved, and he’d even suppressed it back to the True Dao Realm!

The True Dao Realm!

At this moment, he’d descended from the True Void Realm to the True Dao Realm!

She spoke solemnly, “What did you do?”

He gazed at her and smiled, “You can see it for yourself.”

She was puzzled, “Why?”

Yang Ye spoke softly, “When I swallowed that drop of God Blood, remnants of that God’s consciousness remained within it. It could be said that if I wanted to, I could immediately attain the True World Realm, but I want to try going in the opposite direction!”

“The opposite?” She frowned slightly, “What do you mean?”

Yang Ye smiled, “I want to keep suppressing my cultivation, until the day I can’t do it anymore, and then let it erupt. I want to see what will happen then!

An erupting volcano!

That was what Sword Scroll thought of.

The longer a volcano accumulated its magma, the more powerful the eruption would be when it eventually erupted. Yang Ye clearly wanted to treat himself like a volcano and keep tempering himself without end!

Sword Scroll fell silent for a long time and said, “If you suppress your cultivation, your strength…”

“It won’t reduce but increase instead!” Yang Ye smiled, “My Sword Dao and strength do not grow weaker because of my suppressed cultivation. Conversely, the more I suppress it, the stronger my foundation is, and the stronger I’ll be in the future!”

He looked out of the cultivation room and continued, “Tian Xiu is just at the True World Realm, but her strength is sufficient to annihilate Limitbreaker Realm experts with ease, and even Two World and Three World Realm experts are no match for her. Her foundation is unprecedentedly powerful.”

Sword Scroll glanced at Yang Ye, “How long do you plan to suppress yourself?”

Yang Ye smiled, “Until I can’t! During this period, I will keep strengthening my body, soul, and Sword Dao while my cultivation stays as an auxiliary aspect. My strength and Sword Dao will be the main focus!”

She thought for a moment and nodded, “I’ve never seen anyone who suppressed their cultivation, but I think it can work. You can temper your foundation to the extreme while suppressing your cultivation, and it’ll be very useful for your future advancement. However, you must understand that if you suppress it for too long, it’ll be like blowing in a balloon with all your might, and you can make it huge, but it may explode.”

Yang Ye smiled, “I understand. I’ll keep it within my limits!”

She sized up Yang Ye and said, “Presently, ordinary Limitbreaker Realm experts are no match for you.”

“Limitbreaker Realm experts?” Yang Ye grinned, “I can kill them in an instant!”

She grinned.

Yang Ye didn’t leave the Primordial Pagoda, and he went to the rear of Void Mountain instead. He went to the Primal True Dragon’s territory. It was lying on a rock and seemed to be sleeping. Yang Ye noticed that it was many times larger than before, and its aura was much, much stronger.

It was because of the fruit!

Sword Scroll had told him that since it ate the fruit Snowy gave it, the Primal True Dragon had been sleeping all day, and then its size and aura were growing every day.

Sleeping was cultivating!

That was what Sword Scroll told him!

It was blessed by nature!

If it hadn’t encountered extraordinary monsters like Erya and Snowy, the Primal True Dragon would be an extremely rare existence. Unfortunately, it wasn’t rare at all before Snowy and Erya!

Yang Ye didn’t disturb it and went to Oxxy’s territory. Oxxy nodded slightly to greet him upon noticing his arrival.

Yang Ye walked over to Oxxy and sized up the latter. Oxxy was at the peak of the World Lord Realm right now, and if it was given the Primordial Axe of Creation, it wouldn’t be any weaker to the Primal Vicious Tiger that was at the Two World Realm!

Yang Ye patted Oxxy on the shoulder and left.

He visited Erya’s palace again, played with Erya and Snowy for a while, and then left the pagoda.

Outside the pagoda, Yang Ye gazed at Nanli Meng and said, “Come on, it’s time to go outside.”

She smiled, “You’re going out openly?”

Yang Ye grinned, “What else?”

She gazed at him in silence.

Yang Ye turned to face the direction of the Primal Battlefield’s exit, “I want to kill today!”
