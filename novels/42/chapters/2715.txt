Chapter 2716 – Sprite Destruction!

Right at the instant Mo Yu’s head flew up into the air, his soul actually left his body and shot toward the sky!

He was trying to flee!

A sword shot up into the air and pierced his soul.

Mo Yu’s soul stopped there, and he stared blankly ahead.

Yang Ye waved his right hand, and a sword returned to his grasp.

It was Past Life!

Yang Ye didn’t pay any attention to Mo Yu and gazed at his stomach instead. The hole there was healing rapidly.

It was naturally thanks to Snowy!

If he was an ordinary person, he would definitely die from being stabbed by Heaven Executor.

But Yang Ye was different.

He had the best profound energy in the world, and he had an endless supply of them too!

Unless someone sliced off his head and destroyed his soul, he would be impossible to kill!

Mo Yu just stared blankly at the starry sky in the distance. He raised his right hand slowly as if he wanted to say something.

However, Past Life Energy was ceaselessly destroying him!

He didn’t have Snowy or Past Life Energy, so he was helpless to resist it.

He could only wait for death to arrive!

Yang Ye looked up at the sky and tightened his grip on his sword. His gaze was very calm, but the vicious aura and killing intent he emanated was extremely violent!

If Tu dared to try and save Mo Yu, he would kill Mo Yu immediately!

He was no match for her, he was absolutely no match for her, but if she tried to save Mo Yu, then he would fight her no matter what!

He was ready to risk it all if she tried to bully him like that!

Heng Wangu glanced at the boundless starry sky and surprisingly didn’t attack.

Mo Yu’s soul grew more and more ethereal. In the end, he suddenly roared madly with laughter that reverberated through space.

As he laughed and laughed, Mo Yu vanished from Yang Ye and Heng Wangu’s vision.

Tu didn’t show herself even at the moment he fully vanished!

Meanwhile, Heaven Executor suddenly shook and released a slightly sorrowful sword howl. After that, it shot up into the air!

Suddenly, Yang Ye appeared before Heaven Executor, and it slashed at him.

A vicious grin appeared on Yang Ye’s lips. It was no match for him when it was wielded in the hands of Mo Yu, so how dare it attack him when it wasn’t wielded by anyone?

Yang Ye swung Past Life.

Bam!Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Heaven Executor was blasted away, and then Yang Ye chased after it. It planned to counterattack, but Yang Ye grabbed it!

Bang!

A wave of sword energy rippled out from the sword, but Yang Ye casually slapped it into bits!

After that, he tossed the sword into the Primordial Pagoda.

Heaven Executor stabbed into the Ascension Platform. It was just about to fly into the air when a small paw descended on its hilt.

It was Snowy!

Snowy gazed at it indifferently, and her little face had a rare tinge of icy coldness.

Heaven Executor used to be quite close to it. However, since it obtained a new Sprite, and especially after it devoured the sword energy it had released in the past, it wasn’t the same sword anymore!

Snowy pondered deeply for a moment, and then she grabbed Heaven Executor with both paws!

Meanwhile, countless strands of sword energy erupted from the sword with the intent of mincing Snowy into bits.

Snowy squeezed down with her paws.

In an instant, the sword energy was enveloped by Snowy’s spirit energy, and then the sword started to tremble violently!

Sword howls resounded incessantly from it!

Sprite Destruction!

Snowy rarely used Sprite Destruction because it was very cruel, but she couldn’t take it this time!

Outside the Primordial Pagoda.

Yang Ye gazed at Heng Wangu, and the latter raised his right hand slowly. In an instant, a beam of golden light enveloped him, and then a ray of golden light swept at Yang Ye!

Yang Ye grinned, and his smile was quite ferocious!

A moment later, a ray of sword energy flashed!

Hiss!

Everywhere it passed, space was fragile as paper and was instantly sliced open!

Just like that, they collided in the most direct manner.

Boom!

Space shook, and then two figures were pushed back repeatedly.

Yang Ye wiped off the blood on the corner of his mouth, and then he stood up straight and closed his eyes slowly.

The five swords behind Yang Ye trembled, and then they shot up into the sky. At this moment, all the experts in battle looked toward the sky!

The energy of the five elements!

The energy of the five elements emanated by those five swords caused the expressions of the experts here to change drastically!

Heng Wangu’s eyes narrowed slightly as well, and there was an unprecedentedly solemn expression in them.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly pointed his sword forward, “Go!”

As soon as he gave the command, the five swords dived down from above, and the energy of the five elements they emanated started to tear apart everything around them.

At this moment, all the other experts retreated and created space between them and the area Yang Ye was fighting Heng Wangu at.

That area was now their private battlefield.

Meanwhile, other fierce battles were going on.

An Nanjing and Zuo Mu’s battle, and Jian Wudi and Emperor Li’s battle!

At a point in space, afterimages and monstrous saber energy covered the area!

Boom!

Suddenly, the space there collapsed, and then two figures retreated by over 1km!

Zuo Mu was the first to stop, and he twisted his body slightly sideways before swinging his saber repeatedly.

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!

The saber energy rippled at An Nanjing like waves.

An Nanjing had an indifferent expression on her face as she hurled the spear forward. At the same time, she leaped up and followed it…

Meanwhile, Jian Wudi and Emperor Li had stopped fighting.

They were standing in confrontation from afar!

Emperor Li sized up Jian Wudi, and then he glanced at his body. His body was covered in sharp sword energy!

Emperor Li slowly clenched his fists, but he didn’t attack. He looked to the side, and he could see the entire situation in the surroundings.

Based on the current situation, the End World clearly didn’t have an advantage.

Emperor Li’s eyes narrowed slightly, and no one knew what he was thinking.

Meanwhile, Jian Wudi suddenly said, “I’m afraid the End World is trying to drag you into a trap.”

Emperor Li gazed at Jian Wudi, and the latter chuckled, “No matter what they promised you, it seems they can’t even keep themselves safe. Moreover, I’m sure you’ve realized that killing Yang Ye will drag you into a vortex that involves Destiny. You’re strong, and so long as you don’t go too far, Destiny can’t do anything to you. But showing yourself now… Heh…”

Emperor Li replied indifferently, “If they can show themselves, they would be here by now. Since they haven’t, it’s obvious that they are being kept busy by something. Right?”

Jian Wudi nodded, “Then shall we continue?”

Jian Wudi wasn’t someone who liked to rely on words to win a battle!

However, Emperor Li was quite hesitant.

Meanwhile, a few sword howls resounded from afar. Both of them looked over, and they saw five flying swords madly attacking Heng Wangu!

Five element swords!

Besides that, Yang Ye was ceaselessly suppressing Heng Wangu with his own attacks!

Emperor Li’s face fell from the sight of this.

Yang Ye had the upper hand!

Once Yang Ye defeated Heng Wangu, the situation would be instantly turned around!

If Yang Ye and Jian Wudi joined forces, killing him wouldn’t be very difficult either!

Jian Wudi’s face remained indifferent, but he was quite shocked inside. Yang Ye’s attacks were quite unusual, and they felt quite dangerous even to him!

But how old was Yang Ye?

At the same time, he felt a little worried.

Yang Ye’s Sword Dao was very demonic, and it wasn’t a righteous one.

Boom!

Suddenly, the golden statue behind Heng Wangu was slashed into bits, and the latter retreated over 1km to create distance between himself and Yang Ye.

Yang Ye didn’t stop. He stomped his right foot down and shot forward while five swords followed by his side.

Heng Wangu stared at Yang Ye and clenched his fists slowly. A wave of powerful energy was rapidly converging around him.

Meanwhile, Jian Wudi’s face changed slightly as he hurriedly said, “Watch out!”

He was about to take action when a wave of aura pressed down upon him.

Jian Wudi gazed at Emperor Li and spoke angrily, “If you want to fight, then let’s fight!”

He flicked countless rays of sword energy at Emperor Li.

Emperor Li grunted coldly and charged at Jian Wudi.

Meanwhile, Heng Wangu squatted down partially and clenched both his fists. Countless strands of energy converged incessantly into his arms before flowing into his fists.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye arrived.

Yang Ye swung his sword!

The five swords slashed down with him.

Six swords descended!

Heng Wangu closed his eyes slowly, fell silent for a moment, and then raised both his hands and slammed his fists forward!

Boom! Boom!

A ray of golden light instantly enveloped Heng Wangu. At the same time, a wave of destructive energy erupted from his fists like a volcano!

Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!

The five element swords that led the charge were blasted away, but Yang Ye forcefully endured the energy. However, it was really too, too strong.

Heng Wangu moved forward incessantly while Yang Ye was pushed back incessantly, and blood kept seeping out from his mouth. Moreover, he felt like his internal organs had cracked open!

Yang Ye was pushed over 3km back.

He stomped his right foot down and stopped himself, but the space behind him was instantly obliterated!
