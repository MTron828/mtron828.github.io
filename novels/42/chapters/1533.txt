Chapter 1534 - Your Whole Family Is Full Of Humans!

Translator: InVader

At the moment the old man attacked, the black robed man had suddenly transformed into a ray of blood red light that vanished into the sky.

He was extremely swift and instantly vanished from the old man’s vision.

A cold smile curled up on the corners of the old man’s mouth, “Let me see how good you are at escaping!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he took a step forward and vanished on the spot.

After the old man vanished, a woman appeared where he had been standing.

The woman wore a snow white dress, and she was drop dead gorgeous. Just standing at the entrance of the city made the world around her dim in comparison, and there was a pure white fan in her hand.

She gazed at the direction which the old man had vanished towards, and then she shook her head, “Fool!”

As soon as she finished speaking, she vanished on the spot.

…

After he entered Oblivion Boundary, Yang Ye immediately sped up. A day later, he finally left the mountain range and arrived within the Demon Territory.

Actually, the demon race wasn’t underdeveloped, both in strength and its civilization.

In the universe, the human civilization was definitely the most advanced, and it was the first civilization to appear in the universe. In the beginning, the demon race and the various other races of living beings suffered a huge loss because of this. In the end, all of them started to learn from the human race.

Because they’d understood that if they lagged behind, then they wouldn’t be able to fight against the human race!

So, there were many human buildings in the Demon Territory. However, they were much larger than the buildings in the Human Territory. Besides that, the demon race would trade with the human race. For example, some of the spirit herbs and other things which it needed would be sold to the humans. Moreover, the demon race didn’t just limit its trading to the human race, and it traded with other races of living beings as well.

It was prosperous!

It was prosperous just like the human race!

Two hours later, Yang Ye stopped moving. There was a city in front of him, and it was called Colossus City.

Yang Ye didn’t hesitate to walk towards the city. He didn’t conceal himself and just walked openly into the city. The reason he dared to do that was because many demon beasts took human form and lived in that manner. Especially in the cities. Any demon beast which entered the city had to take human form. It was a rule throughout the Demon Territory!

Of course, it was also because he had the Sword Domain to conceal his aura. Otherwise, once the demon beasts sensed his human aura, then he would be in huge trouble.

The reason Yang Ye had entered Colossus City was because he wanted to utilize the teleportation formation here to get to the Divine Phoenix Clan’s Phoenix Domain. There were numerous clans of demon beasts in the Demon Territory, and the strong clans would establish their own worlds. They called them domains. The Divine Phoenix Clan’s domain was called the Phoenix Domain. If he didn’t utilize a teleportation formation, he may not be able to get to Phoenix Domain even if he flew for a month!

The people in the city were extremely robust. Regardless of whether it was the men or women, all of them were robust. So, once Yang Ye entered the city, he instantly became the odd one out.

Because even the smallest person here was more than two times his size!

Yang Ye gradually noticed that the demon beasts in the surroundings were shooting slightly hostile gazes at him.

Suddenly, a middle aged man appeared in front of Yang Ye.

The middle aged man stared at Yang Ye, “Human?”

Many demon beasts in the surroundings immediately surrounded them when they heard the middle aged man. Amongst all the races of living beings, the demon race hated dealing with the human race the most. It couldn’t be helped; the humans were too sly and full of tricks. So, they practically always suffered losses when dealing with the human race. Coupled with the fact that the humans were fond of the inner cores of demon beasts. Actually, it should be said that every part of a demon beast was a treasure to the humans. So, humans frequently hunted demon beasts.

Even though they didn’t dare to do it openly, such incidents occurred in secret every single day,

Yang Ye gazed at the middle aged man. A moment later, his figure appeared before the middle aged man, and then he swung his fist forward. The middle aged man was slightly stunned. He hadn’t expected Yang Ye to attack right away, and he immediately swung his fist forward once he recovered from his shock.

Boom!

An explosion resounded, and then the middle aged man was blasted over 1km away. Meanwhile, Yang Ye appeared in front of the middle aged man and said, “Human? Your whole family is full of humans!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he swung another punch!

The middle aged man hurriedly swung a punch at Yang Ye’s fist!

Boom!

An explosion resounded. The middle aged man spat out a mouthful of blood while his figure was blasted away again.

Once the middle aged man was blasted flying again, Yang Ye appeared in front of him again. Meanwhile, the middle aged man hurriedly raised his hands and said, “It’s a misunderstanding! It’s an utter misunderstanding!”

Yang Ye didn’t attack again and said, “A misunderstanding?”

The middle aged man wiped off the blood on the corner of his mouth and spoke bitterly, “Brother, I merely expressed my doubts. Why did you hit me so hard?”

Yang Ye spoke indifferently, “Do you still have doubts?”

The middle aged man hurriedly waved his hand, “None. How could a human possibly possess such strength? Your strength is even greater than many demon beasts.”

Yang Ye glanced at the other demon beasts in the surroundings, and they hurriedly walked away when they saw Yang Ye look in their directions.

The strength Yang Ye revealed was extremely formidable! Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

No demon beast was willing to offend the strong!

Meanwhile, the middle aged man suddenly asked, “Which clan are you from? You’re so strong!”

Yang Ye glanced at him and said, “The Goat Clan!”

“The Goat Clan?” The middle aged man was stunned, and then he said, “How can that be possible? Such a weak clan…” He seemed to have thought of something and hurriedly stopped himself at this point.

Yang Ye was stunned as well. He’d just spoken casually, but he hadn’t expected the Goat Clan to really exist! However, based on what the middle aged man said, the Goat Clan seemed to be quite weak. But that was good. Because if it was a very weak clan, then using their identity would definitely not draw too much attention to him!

Meanwhile, the middle aged man smiled embarrassedly, “The Goat Clan’s overall strength is comparatively weak, and it can be barely considered a five star power. But I never expected such an expert like you to have come from the Goat Clan. Are you going to participate in the Meeting of the Clans?”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “The Meeting of the Clans?”

“You don’t know about it?” The middle aged man was stunned.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye said, “I know! Of course I do! Right, are you going to participate as well?”

The middle aged man nodded, “Of course! It’s a grand gathering that’s only held once every ten years! How could I possibly miss it?”

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment, and then he started talking with the middle aged man. The middle aged man was quite straightforward, so Yang Ye indirectly obtained the information he needed.

The middle aged man’s name was Hu Meng, and he was from the Tiger Clan. The Meeting of the Clans was actually a tournament, and all the clans of demon beasts throughout the demon race would be participating. The demon race held the tournament to motivate the younger generation and to unite the entire demon race.

If the demon race in the large world didn’t stay united, then only annihilation would be awaiting it!

Even the most complicated race, the human race, would immediately put aside their differences and become united in the face of foreign invasion!

A race of living beings that didn’t stay united was practically dead.

Participate in the Meeting of the Clans!

Yang Ye had decided to participate. Because it provided many rewards, and one of them was the chance to enter the Divine Phoenix Clan’s Hallowed Grounds to cultivate for a month. He didn’t know what sort of place it was, but he knew that he could openly enter the inner areas of the Divine Phoenix Clan.

Previously, he’d been thinking about how he would enter the Divine Phoenix Clan. He could sneak in since he had the Sword Domain, but could he go into the inner areas of it?

It was extremely difficult and dangerous.

But the top three in the Meeting of the Clans would be allowed to enter the Divine Phoenix Clan’s Hallowed Grounds. As far as he was concerned, getting in the top three wasn’t a huge problem. Of course, he couldn’t go there while his face was completely exposed. So, Yang Ye got a mask. It didn’t cover his entire face, and it just covered the upper half.

Hu Meng was very puzzled by this. Yang Ye just smiled and said, “My Goat Clan is weak, so I have to keep a low profile!”

Hu Meng nodded, “True! Right, Brother Ye Yang, since we’re going to participate in the Meeting of the Clans, how about we go together?”

“That’s what I was thinking!” Yang Ye smiled. Even though he had a map of the Demon Territory, it was just a map while Hu Meng was a living map. Moreover, he could avoid being discovered if he stayed with Hu Meng. Because if he went around on his own, it was very likely that other demon beasts would come looking for trouble with him.

Just like that, the man and beast started traveling together.

The Meeting of the Clans was being held in the largest city in the Demon Territory, Heaven’s Vault City. The Meeting of the Clans was being held in three days, so all the geniuses of the demon race were traveling towards Heaven’s Vault City.

The Meeting of the Clans was an opportunity for the youths of the demon race, it was an opportunity to make a name for themselves. At the same time, they could bring glory and honor to their own clans.

Besides that, the most important thing was that the top three in the Meeting of the Clans would represent the demon race when competing with the other races.

Even though Sky Sky Continent was in an age of peace right now, the various races of the continent were still fighting each other both openly and in secret. So, this competition became a way for the various races to compete with each other.

For example, during the competition with the human race, if they won their battles against the geniuses of the human race, they would bring honor and glory to the entire demon race!

It didn’t take long for Yang Ye and Hu Meng to arrive before the teleportation formation in Colossus City. But they had to line up because there were too many who wanted to travel to Heaven’s Vault City.

All the demon beasts of the younger generation… No, it wasn’t just the younger generation, even the older generation would be heading to Heaven’s Vault City to watch the battles. However, Colossus City was the only city in an area of around 500,000km that had a teleportation formation. So, Colossus City had been utterly packed since a few days ago!

Yang Ye and Hu Meng lined up like everyone else, and it took an entire day before it was their turn. Even though it was quite a waste of time, it couldn’t be helped. They couldn’t just beat up the first person in the line and jump the queue, right? Yang Ye wasn’t a madman, so if others didn’t offend him, he wouldn’t go look for trouble with them.

Right when Yang Ye and Hu Meng were about to enter the teleportation formation, a young man in a violet robe suddenly appeared in front of them. The young man glanced at Yang Ye and Hu Meng, and then he walked straight ahead towards the teleportation formation.

He’s trying to jump the queue? Yang Ye was stunned, and then he was about to speak.

However, Hu Meng pulled on Yang Ye’s arm and shook his head, “We can’t afford to offend him!”

“No fucking way!” Yang Ye was furious, “Just watch as I teach him how to act like a human being!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye vanished on the spot.
