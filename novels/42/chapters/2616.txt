Chapter 2617 – He Must Die!

Yang Ye’s mind went blank when he witnessed this!

Blank!

At this moment, Yang Ye was completely stunned!

Snowy was horrified, helpless, and in pain!

“Haha!” The old man seemed rather insane, “Yang Ye, do you remember that bald old man which that woman killed on this bridge? Yes, he was my elder brother, my elder brother by blood! We brothers cultivated together, came to the Origin World together, and attained the Destiny Realm together. However, he died because of you. Now, I’m going to make you pay a hundredfold!”

The old man was about to do it again once he finished speaking!

Suddenly, Yang Ye vanished on the spot.

The old man’s eyes narrowed slightly, and he casually tossed Snowy back into the spatial rift.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye had arrived before him!

At the same time, a wave of monstrous slaughter intent assaulted him!

The old man was shocked, he’d never seen such terrifying slaughter intent!

It wasn’t at the Lord Realm anymore!

It was Destiny Realm slaughter intent!

As soon as he noticed this, horror filled the old man!

The gap between Yang Ye and them was a gap in their realms of cultivation. However, once Yang Ye’s slaughter intent attained the Destiny Realm, it represented that gap would shrink!

It would shrink tremendously!

The old man didn’t dare act carelessly. He clenched both his fists and slammed them forward!

However, Executor’s might was completely different now that it carried Destiny Realm slaughter intent.

Hiss!

The blood red sword obliterated the energy from the old man’s punches, allowing Yang Ye to instantly get close to the old man. Meanwhile, a spear condensed into form in the old man’s grasp. A moment later, the spear pierced through Yang Ye’s chest!

However, the old man was horrified!

Because Yang Ye didn’t dodge his attack, and Yang Ye had intentionally allowed it to hit!

A moment later, a sword stabbed into the old man’s chest, and then a hand grabbed his throat!

Just like that, the old man was lifted up by Yang Ye!

At this moment, the old man saw a Yang Ye who was completely different than before!

A blood red Yang Ye!

Yang Ye’s entire body was blood red. Blood red hair, blood red pupils, and he emanated boundless slaughter intent!

After he attained the Destiny Realm, he’d seen a vast number of experts, and it was the second time he’d seen such dense slaughter intent!

Yang Ye raised the old man closer to himself. At this moment, he had an extremely ferocious and terrifying look on his face, and it was simply impossible to describe with words!

Countless watched as Yang Ye nailed the old man to the bridge with his sword, and then he started to slice off piece after piece of flesh from the old man!

Every swing of his sword would take a slice of flesh from the old man, a slice as thin as a cicada’s wings!

The old man laughed ferociously, “Yang Ye, is this all you’ve got?”

Yang Ye ignored the old man and just continued slicing. At the same time, his icy cold voice resounded, “I, Yang Ye, swear on my life that I’ll kill everyone in this world. I’ll make everyone in this world pay. If I fail to do so, I’m willing to suffer the cruelest death in the world and never be reincarnated!”

Boom!

As soon as he finished speaking, countless strands of slaughter intent swept out madly from within him!

At this moment, his slaughter intent rose crazily!

Slaughter intent was unlike sword intent. It didn’t depend on the mental state, it depended on the desire to kill. When the desire to kill arrived at a person’s limits, that person’s slaughter intent would rise! It was why his slaughter intent hadn’t improved for so long!

It was because it had never reached his limits!

Now, it hadn’t just reached his limits! It broke past his limits!

It was simply boundless!

Kill!

Yang Ye’s desire to kill was unprecedented!

Yang Ye’s desire to kill and his slaughter intent had surpassed his limits. Now, just his sword intent and Sword Heart were insufficient to suppress all of it. Or it should be said that his sword intent and Sword Heart were completely suppressed by them!

His sword was a sword of slaughter now!

As for his Dao, it had changed from the Sword Dao to the Slaughter Dao! A Dao of slaughter!

Amid this boundless slaughter intent, Yang Ye sensed an unprecedented force!

Yang Ye stopped and raised his hands. In an instant, a powerful barrier appeared around him…

No…

It was a Domain!

A Domain!

The old man gazed at Yang Ye with horror, “The Slaughter… Slaughter Domain! You’ve actually comprehended the Slaughter Domain!”

The Slaughter Domain!

The old man wasn’t the only one, everyone in the surroundings was shocked as well!

Yang Ye had the Sword Domain already, so if he had the Slaughter Domain now, it would mean that he had dual Domains!

Dual Domains!

They’d witnessed the strength of a Domain before this. Experts below the Destiny Realm were practically instantly killed by Yang Ye! Once Yang Ye mastered the Slaughter Domain… Coupled with the fact that he possessed Destiny Realm slaughter intent now!

At this moment, solemn expressions unconsciously appeared on the faces of countless!

Yang Ye ignored the old man. He was sensing the Domain. The Domain was full of slaughter intent, boundless slaughter intent, and boundless strength!

The slaughter intent was like a fountain of strength, and he could absorb it madly!

Meanwhile, the old man was absolutely uncomfortable while being enveloped by the Slaughter Domain!

Corrosion!

The slaughter intent was madly corroding his mind, and his eyes were gradually starting to turn red!

Kill!

Such a thought had appeared in the old man’s head!

No matter how he tried to suppress it, nothing changed!

So long as he was within Yang Ye’s Slaughter Domain, he couldn’t eliminate the desire to kill!

Suddenly, Yang Ye deactivated the Slaughter Domain!

The old man’s eyes gradually regained their clarity!

However, it wasn’t a good thing for him!

Yang Ye’s sword descended!

As swing after swing sliced off a piece of the old man, it didn’t take long for just bones and the old man’s head to remain!

Yang Ye didn’t stop there and forcefully extracted the old man’s soul!

The old man gazed at Yang Ye with horror, “W-What are you doing?!”

The soul was unlike the body. He could endure bodily pain, but he may not be able to endure pain which came from the soul!

A ball of flames suddenly appeared on Yang Ye’s palm. Just like that, Yang Ye casually tossed it onto the old man’s soul!

“AH!” A shrill and miserable cry resounded!

Suddenly, a wave of mysterious energy appeared. As soon as it appeared, the flames around the old man vanished. At the same time, the slaughter intent around Yang Ye was suppressed!

However, Yang Ye’s Slaughter Domain suddenly appeared once more!

This time, it didn’t just cover the bridge, it covered a huge expanse of space in the surroundings!

Countless people were horrified!

Yang Ye’s powerful slaughter intent immediately started corrupting their minds!

After all, even a Destiny Realm expert hadn’t been able to resist it!

“Kill!” Suddenly, furious howls resounded around the bridge.

It didn’t take long for them to start fighting!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye waved his right hand, and Executor pierced through the old man’s soul!

Dead!

A Destiny Realm expert had died just like that!

Yang Ye walked toward the distance with his sword in hand. At this moment, he killed anyone he saw!

Anyone!

After his sword intent and Sword Heart had been suppressed, then not to mention the others who were affected by his slaughter intent, even he wasn’t very normal now!

The experts in the shadows would naturally not let Yang Ye run wild. After all, he wasn’t Qi Bitian. So, it didn’t take long for a white-haired old man to appear before Yang Ye.

It was the old man who’d taken Snowy, An Nanjing, and Erya!

The old man gazed at Yang Ye who was walking toward him, and he had a rather solemn expression on his face. Now, even a Destiny Realm expert didn’t dare look down on Yang Ye.

Once his slaughter intent attained the Destiny Realm, he had the strength to kill Destiny Realm experts!

Especially when he was holding the Super Divine Treasure, Executor!

The old man spoke solemnly, “Yang Ye, if you don’t resist your slaughter intent now, you’ll be corrupted by it. It’ll take control of you instead…”

Suddenly, Yang Ye appeared before the old man.

Hiss!

A ray of blood red sword energy instantly arrived before the old man!

The old man’s eyes narrowed slightly as he raised his hand. A wave of powerful energy surged out from his palm like a torrent!

Boom!

The energy forcefully stopped Yang Ye’s attack, but the old man was pushed around 300m back!

Moreover, he frowned when Yang Ye’s Slaughter Domain appeared!

The slaughter intent within it was too dense!

So dense that even he found it difficult to resist!

The old man has no choice but to retreat over 30km away and leave the area covered by Yang Ye’s Slaughter Domain!

The old man had an unprecedentedly solemn expression on his face as he gazed at Yang Ye’s blood red figure!

Yang Ye’s slaughter intent was still growing!

It didn’t stop at the Destiny Realm!

It was still rising madly!

Yang Ye didn’t attack the old man, and he just stabbed his sword into the bridge with both hands!Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Hiss!

The part of the bridge beneath Yang Ye exploded apart, inch by inch!

The old man’s desire to kill surged from the sight of this, “Everyone, he must die. If you’re still worried about this and that, we’ll probably have to pay the worst price in the future!”

He received no reply!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye was still destroying the bridge!

The old man spoke solemnly, “Are all of you really going to just let him grow? Allow me to be honest, once he attains the Destiny Realm and is in the same realm as us all, then based on his character and strength, can all of you really stop him?”

“Then kill him!” Suddenly, a voice resounded in the sky, “The Origin World and Eternal Kingdom will jointly bear all consequences!”

Obviously, they were joining forces!

Along with the voice, a pitch black pike flashed down from the sky!

Hiss!

A moment later, it pierced Yang Ye’s chest and blasted him away!

One of the peak experts of this world had attacked!

The master of the Divine Abode!
