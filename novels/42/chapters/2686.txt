Chapter 2687 – They are Wrong!

He saw a village.

There was no water left around him now.

Yang Ye arrived before the village, and an old man in simple clothes appeared before him. There was a young boy around the age of three or four behind the old man.

The young boy scanned Yang Ye curiously while the old man was extremely vigilant.

Meanwhile, countless divine senses and auras surged out from the village. All of them didn’t attack Yang Ye but just surrounded him.

The old man stared at Yang Ye vigilantly, “Who are you?”

Yang Ye glanced at the old man and asked, “What’s your name?”

The old man replied, “The Past Life Clan’s patriarch.”

Yang Ye spoke softly, “That era or this era?”

“You…” The old man gazed at Yang Ye with astonishment, “You… She sent you here?”

Yang Ye nodded.

The old man clenched his fists and glared at Yang Ye, “What more do you want? What more does she want from us?”

Yang Ye remained silent.

Meanwhile, more and more emerged from the village.

They were members of the Past Life Clan, and there were around 300 of them. There were even women and children among them. Of course, they weren’t weak. Some of the men and elderly members of the Past Life Clan weren’t just not weak, they had extremely terrifying auras.

Peak Destiny Realm experts!

Even though there were only two or three of them, it was still very surprising.

Meanwhile, their patriarch spoke solemnly, “What does she want?”

Yang Ye fell silent for a short while before he said, “I want the Past Life Well!”

The old man’s eyes narrowed slightly, “Looks like she really wants us all dead!”

“Big Brother…” Meanwhile, the young boy behind the old man spoke timidly, “U-Um… We’ll all die without that well.”

Yang Ye asked, “Why?”

The young boy hid behind the old man and was still quite timid, “B-Because we need to cultivate, and it’s our last cultivation resource. W-We’ll all die without it.”

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings and fell silent.

Kill them, obtain the well, and he could become a true peak Destiny Realm expert!

At that time, with the Past Life Energy and his current cultivation in the Sword Dao, he could fight any expert from the End World!

However…

Yang Ye shook his head and said, “Those who attacked her all those years ago! Step forward!”

No one stepped forward.Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Yang Ye frowned. Meanwhile, a woman stepped forward and said, “Young Brother, all of them are dead. Some of our ancestors did survive all those years ago, but they can’t survive for long without going into the outside world.”

Yang Ye glanced at them, fell silent for a very long time, and then he said, “The sins of your ancestors shouldn’t be shouldered by you. If you want to head outside, you can leave with me!”

All of them were stunned when they heard this.

They thought they heard him wrong!

The patriarch of the Past Life Clan still remained quite vigilant. Obviously, he was afraid Yang Ye was playing some kind of trick.

Yang Ye shook his head, “Don’t you want that?”

Meanwhile, the young boy suddenly went over to Yang Ye and looked up at him, “B-But grandfather said that there’s a very, very formidable woman who said our ancestors did something wrong, so we can’t go outside. It isn’t just us, even our descendants cannot go outside.”

Yang Ye rubbed the young boy’s head, “She is wrong.”

Yang Ye took the young boy’s hand and walked off.

Many in the village exchanged glances. In the end, they followed Yang Ye under the old man’s lead.

A short while later, Yang Ye arrived before a mysterious barrier. He hadn’t encountered one when entering this place, but he did now.

Yang Ye didn’t hesitate to draw his sword and swing it.

Hiss!

The barrier vanished before Past Life!

Just like that, Yang Ye led them out of the river.

The woman in white wasn’t there by the river anymore. The Past Life Clan’s members who’d finally returned to the outside world gazed at the surroundings with bewilderment. A short while later, they ran madly toward the ruins. It was the home their ancestors had spoken about!

They were finally outside!

But the young boy still held tight to Yang Ye.

Once most of them had left, the woman in white appeared.

She was seated on the rock and looking at the river before her. No one knew what she was thinking.

Yang Ye walked over to her with the young boy.

The young boy greeted her softly, “B-Big Sis…”

The woman in white glanced at him, grinned, and then gazed at Yang Ye. But her expression gradually turned icy cold.

Yang Ye had never seen her so icy cold.

She walked over to him and grinned, “What? Are you judging me?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “I really respect you.”

She smiled, “Is this how you respect me?”

Yang Ye looked up at her, “Perhaps the people of the Past Life Clan did deserve death in the past. They wanted to kill you, and so you killed them. I think that’s a matter of fact. After all, those who kill must be ready to be killed. However, their descendants did nothing wrong. They didn’t betray you. They shouldn’t pay for the mistakes of their ancestors. To be honest, if anyone tried to kill me because of something my ancestor did, I would beat that person to a pulp.”

She laughed coldly, “What? You’re trying to be righteous now?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “I’m not a righteous person. However, I refuse to do anything that goes against my heart.”

He gazed at her and continued, “Allow me to be honest, killing the experts of the Past Life Clan wasn’t wrong. However, endlessly imprisoning their descendants is wrong. Of course, it is your decision. But I don’t think I’m wrong to free them.”

He placed Past Life before her once he finished speaking.

The surroundings fell silent.

Suddenly, Past Life shook and returned to his grasp.

She gazed at Yang Ye, and then she suddenly started laughing.

Yang Ye was stunned!

A short while later, she took his hand and walked off with him, “You didn’t disappoint me. You didn’t go against your own principles in order to curry favor with me, and you dared to tell me that I’m wrong.”

She looked up at the sky, “Our initial intention was to protect this universe, but many of our actions were wrong, absolutely wrong. However, we’re very strong, so strong that even wrong can be made right by us. The person I want to choose isn’t one who will support us, I want someone with their own thoughts and own principles.”

She gazed at Yang Ye at this point, “If a day comes when you meet the other two stronger forms of mine, I hope you can tell them they are wrong, just as you’ve told me!”

She pinched his cheek lightly at this point, “I chose you not because I want you to suppress all living beings in this world; I chose you because I hope a day will come when you will step forward and fight back against my other two forms. Because they really are wrong in certain aspects.”
