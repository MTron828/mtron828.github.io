Chapter 1793 – The Undertaker!

The man was around the age of 30, had hair that hung down to his shoulders, and wore a linen robe. Even though his expression was calm, he had a dignified and overbearing aura.

A 6th stage True Realm expert! Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

The middle aged man was a 6th stage True Realm expert!

Ying Qing and the others were about to attack when Ying Yu suddenly waved his hand and stopped them.

Ying Yu gazed at the middle aged man and said, “You’re from Heaven Pillar Mountain!”

Surprise flashed through the middle aged man’s eyes, “How did you know?!”

A smile appeared on Ying Yu’s mouth, and he replied, “You’re too late. Yang Ye has fled.”

“Fled?” The middle aged man frowned, “Do you know where he is?”

Ying Yu shook his head slightly, “I don’t. However, we can help you find him.”

The middle aged man glanced at Ying Yu and asked, “What do you want in return?”

Ying Yu replied, “Nothing. Because we have enmity with him.”

The middle aged man nodded, “Alright!”

Ying Yu hesitated for a moment and asked, “May I know your name?”

The middle aged man looked up at Ying Yu and replied, “A very long time ago, they called me the Undertaker!”

The Undertaker!

Ying Yu glanced at the middle aged man and said, “Yang Ye’s skill in concealment is outstanding. If he hides and refuses to show himself, then we’ll probably be unable to find him. However, I have a way that’ll definitely be able to force him to show himself. However, it’s a little risky.”

The middle aged man closed his eyes slowly, “Tell me!”

Ying Yu’s smile grew even wider when he heard the middle aged man.

…

The ancient city.

After they left Heaven Desolation Continent, Yang Ye’s group returned to the ancient city, and Nether Maiden and the others returned here with him.

In the Primordial Pagoda, Yang Ye started recuperating like a madman.

Healing his injuries!

Even though he’d gained the upper hand at the end of the battle with Ying Yu, it had exhausted a tremendous amount of his strength.

That battle allowed him to realize that while he could fight 6th stage True Realm experts, it was quite difficult for him to kill them. If the battle between them continued, then his chances of winning would only be 50% if he didn’t use external sources of strength like the Divine Yin Flame and the Wargod’s arm!

In other words, it was likely that he would be killed!

As for the woman in a red dress. Even though she was at the 6th stage of the True Realm too, she couldn’t be judged based on convention. Her strength absolutely surpassed the 6th stage of the True Realm by a huge amount.

In short, his strength was far from sufficient!

The main reason was that his opponents were extremely old existences. As for the younger generation, it was very rare to find anyone in the younger generation who was capable of fighting him.

Suddenly, a voice resounded in Yang Ye’s ears, “Kid! Let me out! I can fight 10 existences like that old geezer from before!”

Yang Ye turned around and saw the head had suddenly appeared not too far away from him.

After the head yielded that day, he’d remained within the Primordial Pagoda, and the Primordial Pagoda didn’t attack him again. However, Yang Ye didn’t let him leave either. It was mainly because Yang Ye didn’t dare to do so. After all, the head was a terrifying existence.

Once the head was released, it was obvious that he would be the first to be killed by the head!

At that time, he wouldn’t be a match for the head without the Primordial Pagoda to help suppress the head!

Yang Ye glanced at the head and said, “Can you deal with that woman in a red dress?”

The head frowned, “She’s an Evil Cultivator, and she isn’t ordinary. But what’s she doing here?”

“She was sealed!” Yang Ye continued, “She was sealed by someone.”

Actually, it was probably the old man in a Daoist’s robe who had sealed her. Since he’d sealed her himself, how could she be an ordinary person?

“She was sealed?!” The head pondered deeply for a moment and replied, “I can sense that her strength hasn’t recovered to its peak. However, I have nothing to fear even if her strength returns to its peak! Kid, let me out and I’ll help you deal with her!”

Meanwhile, Qiong Qi suddenly appeared not too far away from Yang Ye. He glanced at the head and said, “Hou Qing, will you die if you stop bragging for a second?”

“I’m bragging?” Hou Qing spoke angrily, “Qiong Qi, you think I’m no match for that woman?”

Qiong Qi replied indifferently, “You’ll definitely be able to defeat her in her current state if you were at your peak. But you’re absolutely not a match for her now. Just look at yourself. You’re just a head. How will you even fight her?”

Fury instantly covered Hou Qing’s face, “It’s all that damnable Sovereign of Man’s fault!”

Qiong Qi suddenly asked, “How did you offend him?”

“Why the heck would I offend him? Do I have nothing better to do?” Hou Qing spoke angrily, “I just had a sudden desire to make a trip to the human race’s territory. But I actually bumped into him, and then he hunted me down for nine days and nights. In the end, I had no other choice but to tear open the barrier and flee to this lower dimension. Fortunately, he didn’t dare to come down with me. Otherwise, I would be dead!”

“The Sovereign of Man?” Yang Ye gazed at Hou Qing, “Who’s that?”

Hou Qing glanced at Yang Ye and said, “The original owner of that sword.”

Yang Ye asked, “Is he strong?”

Hou Qing’s eyelids twitched, “He’s the sovereign of your human race. What do you think?”

Yang Ye asked, “The sovereign of the human race? He’s the strongest in the human race?”

Hou Qing shook his head, “Ignorance is truly terrifying!”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

Meanwhile, Qiong Qi suddenly said, “He isn’t the strongest in the human race, but his status in the human race is extremely high, and his strength is extraordinary as well. The human race has its Sovereign of Man, Sovereign of Earth, Sovereign of Sky, and Sovereign Emperor. The Sovereign of Man manages the human race, the Sovereign of Earth manages the nine hells, the Sovereign of Sky manages the heavens. As for the Sovereign Emperor, he’s very mysterious and rarely shows himself.”

Qiong Qi paused for a moment and continued, “Kid, I suddenly realized that the Sovereign of Man and the Sovereign of Sky are linked to you!”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “What do you mean?!”

Qiong Qi said, “The Sovereign of Man is the wooden sword’s owner. So, he’ll definitely come looking for you. As for the Sovereign of Sky, he’ll definitely come for you.”

Yang Ye felt even more puzzled, “Why would the Sovereign of Sky come for me?”

Qiong Qi replied, “Because his daughter is with you!”

Yang Ye was stunned, and then he spoke with astonishment, “Xiao Qi is the Sovereign of Sky’s daughter?”

Qiong Qi nodded.

Yang Ye thought for a moment and said, “Perhaps it’s a good thing!”

Qiong Qi asked, “What do you mean?”

Yang Ye was quite excited, “Look, while I haven’t gone up there, I have so many people to rely on up there. As for you, Brother Qiong Qi, you’ll definitely be able to let me roam freely through the demon race! Besides that, based on my relationship with Xiao Qi, I’ll have the Sovereign of Sky’s protection in the human race’s territory, so I’ll be able to roam freely there too!”

He gazed at Hou Qing when he spoke up to this point. He was just about to speak when Hou Qing suddenly said, “If you go to the Shaman Race’s territory, you’ll die before you realize you’re dead.”

Yang Ye asked, “Why?”

Qiong Qi said, “Because the shaman race is on very bad terms with the human race. That’s why he was reduced to such a state after making a trip to the human race’s territory.”

Hou Qing glanced coldly at Qiong Qi, “Do you think you wouldn’t suffer if you go there?”

Qiong Qi spoke indifferently, “I know, so I wouldn’t go there. Unlike someone who’s so courageous and went there on his own!”

Hou Qing ignored Qiong Qi and gazed at Yang Ye, “Kid, let me go, and I’ll deal with those enemies of yours. What do you think?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “I’m afraid you’ll deal with me first!”

Hou Qing was at a loss for words.

Yang Ye didn’t waste his breath on them and continued his recuperation.

Hou Qing glanced at the surroundings and said, “I know what this place is.”

Qiong Qi replied, “It took you so long?”

Hou Qing spoke in a low voice, “I didn’t expect that the treasure my shaman race is searching for would actually be in this kid’s possession.”

Qiong Qi fell silent for a moment and said, “I didn’t expect it either!”

Hou Qing glanced at Yang Ye and said, “That kid has great fortune!”

Qiong Qi shook his head, “But he faces great danger too.”

Hou Qing said, “Fortune has always been accompanied by danger!”

Qiong Qi nodded, “That’s true!”

A moment of silence ensued, and then Hou Qing spoke abruptly, “What will you do if he goes to the large universe? Don’t tell me that you won’t act against him. If this treasure returns to the hands of the human race, then it won’t just be a huge threat to my shaman race, it’ll be a huge threat to your demon race too.”

Qiong Qi fell silent for a long time, and then he replied, “I don’t know.”

…

Yang Ye’s injuries were completely healed with the help of the primordial Pagoda. He was lucky to have the Primordial Pagoda, or those injuries would have taken a few months to heal.

He didn’t leave the Primordial Pagoda. After playing with Snowy for a while, he went to the 3rd level.

Training!

As far as he was concerned, the most important thing was improving his strength. After all, many people were coming to look for trouble with him, and all of them were extremely old experts. His current strength was clearly quite insufficient to face them!

Moreover, while he had the Martial Envoy’s help this time, would she help him again?

It was best to rely on himself!

Time trickled by. In the blink of an eye, three days had passed.

Suddenly, Yang Ye stopped cultivating and returned to the outside world.

In a hall, Yang Ye gazed at Yang Lianshuang and asked, “What happened?” He’d stopped cultivating because Yang Lianshuang wanted to see him.

Yang Lianshuang remained silent for a moment and said, “The Ying Clan’s coalition has gone to the Wu Clan, and they want the Wu Clan to hand over An Nanjing to them. The Wu Clan may be unable to refuse their request.”

Yang Ye’s eyes instantly turned icy cold when he heard this.
