Chapter 930 – No? Then I’m Leaving!

Om!

A sword howl resounded, and then a crescent of sword energy swept down from the city wall. It was extremely swift to the point that many weren’t even able to react before over a thousand people at the very front of the group were slashed apart.

Countless internal organs and blood splattered all over the ground. It was an extremely bloody sight!

The group instantly stopped charging.

Everyone gazed at Yang Ye with shock. At this moment, there was no ferocity and rage in their eyes, there was only terror!

The middle aged man who pointed at Yang Ye and cursed Yang Ye had a solemn expression on his face as well!

Meanwhile, Shang Qingying suddenly appeared in front of Yang Ye, and there were 5 old men behind here. All of them were high rank Half-Saints!

The middle aged man’s face became gloomy when he saw Shang Qingying, and he said, “Instructor Shang, I need an explanation. Otherwise, don’t blame me, Su Yu, for not giving you face.”

Shang Qingying walked over to Yang Ye’s side and said, “His name is Su Yu, and he’s the younger brother of the Su Clan’s Patriarch. The Su Clan is one of the 2 strongest clans in the city. It can be said to be deeply rooted in the city, and it doesn’t just have huge influence in the city, it even has a certain amount of influence in our academy. Because some of the elders and students of the academy are from the Su Clan.”

When she spoke up to this point, Shang Qingying glanced at Su Yu and the others before she continued, “Because most of the Su Clan’s properties are at the northern side of the city, those demon beasts you allowed to enter the city have destroyed over a thousand of the Su Clan’s properties, and numerous experts of the Su Clan perished as well. So....”

Yang Ye said, “So they think that it’s my fault, and they’ve come to look for trouble with me, right?”

Shang Qingying sighed softly and said, “Yang Ye, I know that you definitely feel displeased, but hear me out. The reason the city still hasn’t fallen into chaos until now is all thanks to the Su Clan and Li Clan. If you act against members of the Su Clan, then a single order from the Su Clan would definitely cause many in the city to rise up in rebellion. Of course, they wouldn’t dare act against the academy, but they’ll definitely target you.”

Yang Ye gazed at her and asked, “So what do you think I should do?”

She fell silent for a moment before she said, “Firstly, you can’t let anymore demon beasts into the city. Secondly, you have to come with me to the Su Clan and explain the matter to the Su Clan’s patriarch. He will give me some face, so it shouldn’t be difficult to let bygones be bygones!”

“Instructor Shang, you’re wrong!” Meanwhile, an old man who stood behind Shang Qingying suddenly stepped forward and said, “It’s not that my Su Clan refuses to give you face, but this incident hasn’t just affected my Su Clan, it has even affected the other clans which are related to my Su Clan. Instructor Ye has allowed demon beasts to enter the city for no reason. While the losses we suffered in terms of various properties and businesses isn’t a big deal, our Su Clan, and the other clans subordinate to us have lost many members. If we were to just let bygones be bygones, then how would my Su Clan maintain its foothold in the city?”

Yang Ye gazed at the old man and asked, “You’re from the Su Clan?”

“I’m Su Wen, the second uncle of the current patriarch of the Su Clan!” The old man spoke indifferently, “I’ve heard about you, Instructor Ye, and I know that you dare to do anything. If you think that you can bully my Su Clan, then you can feel free to try!”

Yang Ye chuckled, and then he gazed at Shang Qingying and said, “Miss Shang, do you see that? The Su Clan clearly possesses the strength to defend the city, yet it hides within the city. However, if we’re unable to defend the city, they’ll blame us for it instead. Tell me the truth, doesn’t it infuriate you?”

“Infuriate my ass!” Meanwhile, the middle aged man pointed his finger at Yang Ye and cursed angrily once more, “Does the city have anything to do with my Su Clan? Did you give us money or other forms of compensation? You didn’t give us anything! So why should my Su Clan risk everything to defend the city for all of you? Ptooey!”

Yang Ye nodded and said, “I understand your Su Clan’s stand.” When he spoke up to this point, Yang Ye flipped his palm, and the ancient sheathe appeared in his grasp. After that, he made a grasping motion, and an intent sword appeared in his right hand. He sheathed the intent sword and said, “From today onwards, the Su Clan will cease to exist in Ocean of Clouds City.”

“You’ll do that? Hahaha!!” The middle aged man roared madly with laughter. However, it didn’t take long for his voice to stop abruptly. Because Yang Ye had suddenly appeared in front of him, and Yang Ye’s hand had clamped down on his throat.

“How dare you!” That elder from the Su Clan, Su Wen, was furious. He was about to attack when Yang Ye released the middle aged man, and then he suddenly vanished on the spot.

Su Wen’s expression changed drastically at the exact same moment that Yang Ye vanished on the spot. He instinctively sensed danger approaching, and he was about to flee from where he stood. However, it was too late because 2 terrifying pressures pressed down upon him like a mountain, causing his figure to stiffen on the spot, and then the tip of a sword pressed against the center of his forehead.

“3rd level Heaven Rank sword intent, 3rd level Heaven Rank slaughter intent, and the Laws of Speed. You....” Su Wen gazed at Yang Ye with astonishment. He knew Yang Ye was strong. But as far as he was concerned, no matter how strong Yang Ye was, Yang Ye’s strength was limited! After all, Yang Ye was only at the Monarch Realm while he was a high rank Half-Saint. Moreover, he was an elder of the Ocean of Clouds Academy and had the Su Clan standing behind him. So, he didn’t take Yang Ye seriously and felt that Yang Ye wouldn’t dare attack him.

However, he was clearly wrong!

“Ye Yang! Don’t act rashly!” Shang Qingying was shocked when she saw Yang Ye attack decisively and even restrain Su Wen with a single move. She hurriedly said, “Elder Su has rendered a huge amount of meritorious service to the academy, and he has a huge network of relationships in the academy. You....”

Hiss!

Shang Qingying hadn’t even finished speaking when a head flew into the air while accompanied by a pillar of blood.

Everyone here was shocked!

After he put an end to Su Wen’s life with a swing of his sword, Yang Ye’s gaze descended onto the middle aged man. The latter’s expression changed, and he flashed into the crowd before he said, “How dare you! Ye Yang! You actually dared to kill a member of my Su Clan because you possess some strength! Good! Since you don’t respect my Su Clan, then don’t blame my Su Clan for being merciless. Everyone! Kill Ye Yang!”

“Kill! Kill Ye Yang!”

“Kill!”

Countless people charged at Yang Ye. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Everyone on the city walls, hear my command! Spare no one!” As soon as he finished speaking, a ray of sword energy slashed out horizontally, and over a thousand people instantly lost their lives! After that, Yang Ye shot into the crowd and arrived in front of the middle aged man, and he grabbed the middle aged man by the throat before the middle aged man could even react. When the middle aged man finally recovered from his shock, he was already on the city walls with Yang Ye.

“You....” The middle aged man was about to speak, but Yang Ye didn’t give him the chance. Yang Ye immediately made a flicking motion with his fingers, and then a sword instantly pierced through the middle aged man’s stomach and nailed him on the wall.

Yang Ye didn’t kill the middle aged man right away. So, the middle aged man was nailed alive to the wall. However, that was a fate worse than death to him!

After he finished doing all of that, Yang Ye’s figure flashed into the crowd, and then rays of sword energy crisscrossed before more than a thousand more perished on the spot.

In the beginning, the crowd dared to charge at him because of the numbers they possessed. But after Yang Ye killed a few thousand with a few swings of his sword, they didn’t dare charge forward anymore, and they even started fleeing madly in all directions.

In less than 10 minutes, almost 10,000 corpses were lying below the city walls.

Most of them had been killed by Yang Ye, but there were many that had been killed by the forces on the city walls. After all, the forces that defended the northern gates didn’t dare to refuse or oppose Yang Ye’s orders.

Shang Qingying walked over to Yang Ye and roared furiously, “Do you realize what you’re doing? What exactly are you trying to do?”

“Then what do you think I should have done?” Yang Ye replied with a question, “Stand there and let them kill me?”

“It didn’t have to develop to such an extent!” Shang Qingying spoke angrily, “If you didn’t act willfully and insist on using such an extreme method, then it wouldn’t have developed to such an extent at all. Do you realize that your actions will definitely make the cultivators of the entire city hate my academy? Do you realize the effects it will have to my academy’s reputation?”

Yang Ye laughed with ridicule, “That so-called reputation you speak of keeping is one that you intend to keep by making the members of the academy use their lives to protect trash like the Su Clan? You intend to sacrifice the lives of countless students to maintain the reputation of the academy? Is that right?”

When he spoke up to this point, Yang Ye’s face turned gloomy, “Miss Shang, it’s your business if you want to do that. But I won’t do that, and I won’t bother about what you do as well. However, what I do is my problem, and I hope you don’t make noise in front of me again. There’s a limit to my patience.”

“Fine, I’ll leave you to do as you please!” Shang Qingying spoke coldly, “Let me see how you deal with the Su Clan!”

Yang Ye looked her in the eyes and said, “I want all the students of the academy and the army of the city to obey my commands. It’s fine if you refuse. I’ll just take my people and leave. I presume that you hope for that to happen as well. Because you can manage the city according to your methods once I’m gone!”

Shang Qingying spoke in a low voice, “What exactly are you planning!?”

Yang Ye chuckled and said, “There isn’t much time left, so I don’t want to explain too much. All I want to say is that harsh times require harsh methods. I needed someone to make a show of strength. Unfortunately, no one stepped forward to play that role. Now, the Su Clan has.”

“No! Absolutely not!” Shang Qingying spoke furiously, “The city will definitely fall into chaos if you touch the Su Clan. Moreover, many people in the academy who are related to the Su Clan will definitely not allow it. At that time....”

Yang Ye nodded and interrupted her, “Since it’s like that, then farewell Miss Shang!”

As he spoke, Yang Ye turned around and gazed at the forces on the city wall, “Are all of you willing to leave the city with me?”

“We are!” The other soldiers and cultivators were quite hesitant, but Hao Shuaibo and the others replied at once.

Yang Ye nodded, “Open the gates. If you’re willing to leave with me, then let’s kill our way out of here!”

Creak!

As soon as Yang Ye finished speaking, the city gates immediately started opening slowly.

“Kill!”
