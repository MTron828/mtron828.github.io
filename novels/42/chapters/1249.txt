Chapter 1250 – The Ruler Of All Regions!

A sword!

There was a tiny sword shaped mark on the center of Yang Ye’s forehead. It was very small and only the size of a pinky, and there was nothing special about it at first glance.

“Didn’t you want to know who I am?” Suddenly, the green robed man’s voice resounded in Yang Ye’s mind, “I’m the Sword God’s Seal that you were looking for.”

The Sword God’s Seal!

Yang Ye’s body shook upon hearing that because he hadn’t expected the green robed man to be the Sword God’s Seal! From the beginning and even now, he’d thought that the man was an elder of the Sword God’s Palace from all those years ago. He hadn’t expected that fellow to not be human at all!

The green robed man said, “I’ll be erasing my consciousness. From today onward, the Sword God’s Seal will become a brand new Sword God’s Seal. So long as you ceaselessly nurture it with Rebirth Rank sword intent, it’ll definitely grow a new consciousness in the future.”

“Erase your consciousness?” Yang Ye’s expression changed slightly, “Why?”

After all, it was extremely difficult for a treasure to form intelligence of its own, especially such a divine treasure. It might take over 10,000 years for it to form a consciousness, yet the Sword God’s Seal actually wanted to erase its consciousness!

The green robed man said, “I should have left with him on the day he died, but I was worried about this seal. It’s the treasure of inheritance in Sword God’s Palace, so how could it fall into the hands of someone weak? Now, it has a master that is worthy of it, and I can leave without any worry. Remember that this seal isn’t just the symbol of the Sword God’s Palace’s Master, it’s a symbol of status in the Sword God’s Pavilion as well.”

Yang Ye frowned, “The Sword God’s Pavilion? What’s that?”

The green robed man pondered deeply for a moment and said, “Wuji established in the Allregion Stellar Continent, and it’s filled with the genius sword cultivators from all regions. Now that so long has passed, I don’t know if the Sword God’s Pavilion is gone or prospering. However, I think that it shouldn’t be gone. Because many of those geniuses aren’t inferior to you at all.”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “What is that place?”

The green robed man explained, “Areas larger than a continent are called stellar regions, and areas larger than stellar regions are called a universe. Our universe has over 100 stellar regions. If all these stellar regions are included, then there might be 2 to 3 thousand worlds of varying sizes. However, our universe only has a single large world, and that’s Allregion Stellar Continent. Allregion Stellar Continent is also called the ruler of all continents. That’s a place where geniuses are truly numerous like grains of sand on the ground, and it’s a place that the powers of countless stellar regions want to enter. Even Wuji at his peak could only be considered as above average there.”

Yang Ye asked, “It doesn’t just have one power on it?”

The green robed man replied, “No power can unite Allregion Stellar Continent. Only powers of a stellar region that are able to unite over 100 worlds are qualified to enter Allregion Stellar Continent.”

Yang Ye asked, “Senior Jian Wuji didn’t unite over 100 worlds, right?”

The green robed man replied, “Just he alone was sufficient to fight against over 100 worlds!”

Yang Ye was speechless.

The green robed man continued, “The Sword God’s Seal is yours now, and you can be considered to be a partial disciple to Wuji. You admit that, right?”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and nodded. Because he wouldn’t have been able to attain Rebirth Realm sword intent without Jian Wuji’s guidance!

The green robed man said, “Since the Sword God’s Seal is in your possession, and you’re a partial disciple to Wuji, you’re the master of Sword God’s Pavilion from this moment onward.”

Yang Ye shook his head, “You wouldn’t be so naïve as to think that they would acknowledge me as the master just because I have the Sword God’s Seal, right?”

The green robed man suddenly asked, “Do you know what the true ability of the Sword God’s Seal is?”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and said, “It can enhance sword energy and sword intent, and it has a formation within it.”

The green robed man replied, “That’s only what’s revealed on the surface!”

Yang Ye asked, “It has other abilities?”

The green robed man said, “Its true ability is to temporarily improve Rebirth Rank sword intent to Returnal Rank sword intent!”

“Returnal Rank?” Yang Ye’s pupils constricted, “The Returnal Rank is above the Rebirth Rank? It can enhance sword intent to the Returnal Rank?”

“It’s only temporary!” The green robed man continued, “Actually, it’s not really the Returnal Rank, and it should be called the Quasi Returnal Rank. Because the Sword God’s Seal can only raise your Rebirth Rank sword intent to its peak. In other words, the Quasi Returnal Rank. However, that’s enough. After all, Quasi Returnal Rank sword intent has surpassed the Rebirth Rank. So long as it has surpassed the Rebirth Rank, all sword cultivators will be suppressed by you. Of course, I’m only talking about sword cultivators who haven’t attained the Quasi Returnal or Returnal Ranks!”

Yang Ye asked, “What if someone in Sword God’s Pavilion has attained the Returnal Rank?”

The green robed man, “Then I’ll pray for you!”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

The green robed man asked, “Do you have any other questions?”

Yang Ye remained silent for an instant before he asked, “Who destroyed Sword God’s palace?”

The green robed man fell silent for a very long time before he answered, “A very strong person!”

Yang Ye asked, “How strong?”

The green robed man spoke solemnly, “Based on that person’s strength, it wouldn’t be a problem for that person to destroy this continent!”

Yang Ye’s face instantly darkened. Destroy the continent? Yang Ye couldn’t help but touch his chest. Can’t that fellow, Qiong Qi, destroy the continent?

Perhaps... maybe..., possibly... I think... it might be possible... let him give it a try....

Yang Ye thought for a moment and said, “Brother, I’m sure you’re aware that person really hates sword cultivators. I....”

The green robed man replied, “I know what you’re trying to say, but I’ll be of no help even if I stay behind. That person’s strength is beyond my ability. Besides Wuji, no one in the last tens of thousands of years throughout Dark Hell Continent is capable of stopping that person.”

Yang Ye gulped, “So, I’m dead?”

“I don’t know!” The green robed man continued, “Do you have any other questions?”

Yang Ye said, “Are you in that much of a hurry to die?”

The man replied, “I’ve wanted to go since the day he died.”

Yang Ye fell silent for a long time before he said, “One last question, where’s the Stellar Sword Diagram?”

The green robed man replied, “It won’t make a difference even if you obtain it!”

Yang Ye said, “I’ve comprehended the Sword Domain!”

“How could that be possible? You....” The green robed man cried out involuntarily, “You’ve comprehended the Sword Domain?”

Yang Ye took a step forward. In an instant, a mysterious force enveloped the surroundings.

“The Sword Domain.... The Sword Domain.... It really is the Sword Domain.... You’ve actually comprehended the Sword Domain....”

Yang Ye could sense the green robed man’s voice was trembling. Yang Ye couldn’t help but feel slightly complacent because of this. After all, the green robed man hadn’t even lost his composure from the fact that Yang Ye possessed Rebirth Rank sword intent!

Suddenly, Yang Ye’s expression changed because he sensed that the green robed man was destroying his own consciousness, “What... what are you doing!”

The green robed man’s voice grew weaker as he spoke, “The Sword God’s Seal is lucky to be able to acknowledge you as its master. As for the Stellar Sword Diagram, just forget about it. Because it has fallen into that expert’s hands....”

Yang Ye was stunned and hurriedly said, “Don’t die so fast. I have another question. How do I use the Sword Domain? Hey? How do I use the Sword Domain?”

“The Sword Domain.... Remember... the Sword Domain... can suppress... all sword intent... within its scope. Even Returnal Rank sword intent.... However, if your cultivation is insufficient, then you’ll pay with your lifespan.... The Sword Domain can also....” The green robed man’s voice stopped abruptly at this point.

Yang Ye was stunned, “Can also what? What? Tell me! Don’t die! Don’t fucking die! Quickly tell me! Hey!”

Not a single sound came from the green robed man.

Yang Ye was stunned and sat on the ground, “I... I’m truly a fool! I actually put the Sword Domain right at the end.... That fellow knew how to use the Sword Domain! I....”

Meanwhile, Yun Banqing walked over to him and spoke softly, “Why think like that?”

Yang Ye gazed at her, laughed bitterly, and remained silent.

She said, “Entrusting your hopes on others is a display of foolishness and lack of ability. You’re no fool!”

Yang Ye replied, “I naturally understand that principle. I just feel that it’s quite a pity. But it isn’t a big deal because I gained quite a bit this time. Besides the Sword God’s Seal, I even obtained a huge amount of useful information.”

Yun Banqing nodded, “That’s the right way to think.”

Yang Ye took a deep breath and stretched out his hand to touch his forehead. Because he hadn’t activated it, the sword shaped mark wasn’t visible on his forehead. But he could sense that the Sword God’s Seal was there. After all, it had fused into one with him. Unfortunately, it didn’t have a consciousness of its own now.

If the green robed man was still alive, then just the Sword God’s Seal alone could definitely be able to fight at least 10 Emperors and even resist Voiders. Yet now, the Sword God’s Seal that had lost its consciousness was like an inanimate object unless it was activated by him! Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“I’ll just nurture it slowly!” Yang Ye shook his head, glanced at the surroundings, and said, “Now, let’s go look for treasures.”

As he spoke, they started walking towards the depths of the hall. They walked for quite some time before they walked out of the palace. There were numerous pavilions in the area behind the palace. Yang Ye glanced at them, and his gaze descended onto one of the pavilions which was called the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion. Yang Ye and Yun Banqing didn’t hesitate to enter it.

Yang Ye was stunned at the moment he stepped into the pavilion, and then wild joy swept through him.

There were around 50 beams of light floating around the pavilion. Some were swords, some were sword armors, some were sword wings.... That wasn’t the main point, the main point was that all of them were at the Emperor Rank!

Not the Quasi Emperor Rank, the Emperor Rank!

The actual Emperor Rank!

“Hahaha! I’m rich!” It wasn’t Yang Ye who spoke these words. The voice had come from the outside.

Yang Ye and Yun Banqing turned around, and they saw a white robed young man and an old man appear not too far away.

Yun Banqing’s expression changed, “The Yuan Clan....”

Yang Ye’s expression had changed as well because the old man was a Voider!

A Voider!

The white robed young man ignored Yang Ye and Yun Banqing. He sized up the surroundings and smiled, “As expected of Sword God’s Palace. They are actually all at the Emperor Rank! Hahaha! All of them belong to me, Yuan Qiubai! Hahaha!”

Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly said, “They are mine!”

The white robed young man, Yuan Qiubai, turned around to look at Yang Ye, “I dare you to say that again!”
