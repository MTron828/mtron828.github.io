Right when Yin’yin soul was on the verge of being lit completely on fire, Yang Ye pressed his hand down on her shoulder and stopped her.

“Big Brother?” She gazed at Yang Ye.

Yang Ye shook his head in response while a wisp of ferocity flashed through his eyes, and the small amount of profound energy that remained within him started surging madly.

Meanwhile, Lu Yan suddenly went over to Yang Ye, and he passed a jade token to him, “This is a token of identity in the Yang Clan, and every single member of the clan possesses one. If you return to the Yang Clan in the future, then you only have to produce it and the members of the Yang Clan would know who you are.”

When he spoke up to this point, he raised his head and looked up at the Eye of the Heaven Dao which was covered in cracks, “Actually, this Eye of the Heaven Dao isn’t a true Eye of the Heaven Dao!”

Yang Ye’s pupils constricted.

Lu Yan continued, “This Eye of the Heaven Dao is merely a projection of the true eye in the Outer Heavens. If it’s the true eye, then we wouldn’t be able to fight back at all. Besides that, if I’m not wrong, then it probably appeared here because of you.”

“Me?” Yang Ye’s brows knit tightly together, and he felt extremely puzzled.

Lu Yan nodded and said, “If I’m not wrong, then you should have something that contains a world of its own, right? A world that can keep living people within it!”

Yang Ye nodded.

Lu Yan laughed bitterly and said, “Do you know? A new world appearing right before it is naturally a form of threat to it, and it’s even a huge threat. Because it isn’t a world that appeared while under its control. Or perhaps I should say that both that world and you aren’t encompassed within its Laws, and it can’t control you. So, it didn’t hesitate to send the Eye of the Heaven Dao here to destroy everything!”

Yang Ye asked in a low voice, “Why doesn’t it just target me?”

“Does it know that precious treasure is within you?” Lu Yan said, “It doesn’t. With its strength, it can only sense that something which can threaten it exists in this world. It will instinctively destroy anything that’s dangerous to it! Of course, the reason it’s destroying this world isn’t entirely because of you. The actions of the Hallowed Grounds and the defiant profounders were really too terrible, so the Heaven Dao of the Outer Heavens would have acted even if you weren’t here!”

Yang Ye looked up into the sky, and he gazed at the eye as he said, “I’d thought that I could do as I pleased upon attaining the Half-Saint Realm. Now I realize that I’m still so weak even when I’m at the Half-Saint Realm. Senior Lu, does that Yang Clan you speak of have existences capable of destroying this Eye of the Heaven Dao?”

Lu Yan pointed at it and said, “The Yang Clan controls thousands of worlds, and it’s equivalent to controlling thousands of Heaven Daos. Actually, such an Eye of the Heaven Dao merely works for them. Understand?”

The corners of Yang Ye’s eyes twitched. At this moment, he finally understood how terrifying the Yang Clan was!

Bang!

Suddenly, blazing flames appeared on Lu Yan. Yang Ye was extremely shocked by this development and said, “Senior Lu....”

Lu Yan interrupted Yang Ye and said, “I would be dead if it wasn’t for your father. I’d intended to use my life to help you return to the Yang Clan. Unfortunately, I don’t have the ability to do that. Take care of yourself!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Lu Yan shot into the sky, and his figure left a trail of flames like a comet as it shot up to the Eye of the Heaven Dao.

Bang!

The sky shook violently as countless more cracks appeared on the eye, and it even became slightly ethereal.

They were dead.... Elder Mu, Lu Yan, Xiao Ying, and many others....

Yang Ye wanted to protect all of them. But in the end, he wasn’t able to protect anymore. It was even to the extent that he couldn’t even protect himself.

“AHHH! I’ll fucking fight you to the death!” When the dark violet bolts of divine lightning were only around 30m away from them, the others were finally unable to endure the terror they experienced from facing impending death, and they ignited their souls and smashed against the eye.

In the end, only Yang Ye and Yin’yin remained here.

A few hundred Saint Realm experts and countless lives had been lost!

“Big Brother, are we going to die together?” Yin’yin held his hand and asked softly.

“I can save both of you!” Suddenly, a voice resounded. Yang Ye and Yin’yin looked over towards the source of the voice, and they saw that a middle aged man had suddenly appeared on their right.

The middle aged man was none other than the City Governor of Ancient Domain City, Lu Yuanhao!

“It’s you!” Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly. When he returned to Profounder Continent, Ding Shaoyao had told him to be careful of Lu Yuanhao, and he’d done exactly that. However, Lu Yuanhao seemed to be aware that Yang Ye was on guard against him. So, Lu Yuanhao remained in closed door cultivation, and he hadn’t shown himself even when the Hallowed Grounds attacked Profounder Continent!

Yet now, he’d suddenly shown himself, and his aura was actually not inferior to the Hallowed Lord and Xu Qianye!

Yin’yin gazed vigilantly at Lu Yuanhao because she felt extremely threatened by the aura he emanated!

Lu Yuanhao had excitement and joy in his eyes as he gazed at Yang Ye, and he said, “Yang Ye, I truly never imagined that the Boundless Sea of Energy would be in your possession. Do you know that the Outer Heavens, the defiant profounders, and a group of mysterious figures engaged in an absolutely chaotic battle to fight for that? Even the Heaven Dao of the Outer Heavens was almost cripple during that battle. However, I never expected that it would have actually fallen into your hands. Needless to say, you really are too lucky!”

Yang Ye said, “You didn’t come down to this world for the sake of the defiant profounders, you came for the Boundless Sea of Energy!”

Lu Yuanhao replied, “If I was able to recruit that group of defiant profounders, then they would naturally be of great help to me. Unfortunately, they were too arrogant and unyielding, so it was impossible to bring them under my control. Moreover, even if they were willing to submit to me, I wouldn’t be able to take them with me. The appearance of the Eye of the Heaven Dao here exceeded everyone’s expectations, and that includes me and the people who back me!”

Yang Ye said, “Why do you think I have the Boundless Sea of Energy in my possession?”

Lu Yuanhao smiled, “Actually, I suspected you had it since the beginning. Because your profound energy is unlike any other ordinary person. Moreover, your speed of advancement was truly too quick. I’d intended to capture you and study you. Unfortunately, you had the Undertaker’s protection and then Lu Yan came along, so I didn’t have any chance.”

Yang Ye asked, “You think you have a chance now?”

Lu Yuanhao glanced at Yin’yin and said, “Yang Ye, I don’t want to become enemies with you. After all, nothing bad has happened between us in the past. Give me the Boundless Sea of Energy and I’ll save you from this world. Moreover, I’ll even introduce you to my backers. Trust me, your future is absolutely limitless with the natural talent and strength you possess!”

Yang Ye remained silent.

Lu Yuanhao continued, “Yang Ye, you don’t have much time left. Hand it over and I’ll take you out of this world. Otherwise....”

“Otherwise what?” Yang Ye raised his head to look at Lu Yuanhao in the eyes, and his profound energy surged madly. He knew that the Boundless Sea of Energy which Lu Yuanhao spoke of was the Primordial Pagoda. He wasn’t able to control the Primordial Pagoda at all, so he couldn’t give it away even if he wanted to. Unless he killed himself, then perhaps it might leave his body!

But was that possible? Of course not! Moreover, even if he could hand it over, he wouldn’t. Because he couldn’t trust Lu Yuanhao.

“You’ll die!” Lu Yuanhao gazed at Yang Ye while the space around them started to tremble violently.

“Don’t you dare!” Fury surged into Yin’yin’s eyes, “I’ll eat you!”

Lu Yuanhao glanced at Yin’yin, and then he gazed at Yang Ye and said, “Yang Ye, this is your last chance. This world will be completely destroyed when those bolts of divine lightning strike the ground. Not to mention that you’re only a Half-Saint now, you would die a graveless death even if you’re a Saint. Hand it over and you’ll gain new life!”

Yang Ye shook his head and said, “You can leave. I can’t kill you, but you can’t kill me as well.”

“I still want to try!” As soon as he finished speaking, a huge palm tore through space and appeared above Yang Ye. However, a huge mouth suddenly bit it and then swallowed it.

Lu Yuanhao grunted coldly while a trace of ferocity flashed through his eyes. He was about to attack again when a ray of light flashed, and that ray of sword light was aimed straight at Lu Yuanhao.

Lu Yuanhao was astounded by this, and he slapped his palms towards the space before him, causing it to warp strangely. Within that strangely warped expanse of space was a ray of sword light that had been warped as well!

In next to no time, the sword light was twisted into pieces. Lu Yuanhao raised his head and looked over, and he saw the Sword Spirit standing by Yang Ye’s side.

2 Saint Realm experts! Lu Yuanhao took a deep breath. He knew that he couldn’t take it by force at all. It wasn’t just because Yang Ye had 2 Saint Realm experts by his side, it was also because the bolts of divine lightning were only around 20m away from them. If Yang Ye were to disperse the Sword Domain, then he would be instantly obliterated!

“Yang Ye, you’ve given up your final chance to survive!” Lu Yuanhao glanced coldly at Yang Ye, and then he tore a talisman apart. As soon as it was torn, a huge black colored hand stretched down from the horizon and grabbed Lu Yuanhao. Right when the hand was about to return from where it came, a dark violet bolt of divine lightning suddenly shot out from the Eye of the Heaven Dao, and it struck the enormous hand. The enormous hand instantly became translucent, and it seemed like it would disperse at any moment.

“Hmph!” A cold grunt suddenly resounded. It sounded like it was right here, yet it also sounded like it was thousands of kilometers away!

That enormous hand seemed to fear something, so it didn’t attack the Eye of the Heaven Dao, and it merely took Lu Yuanhao with it and vanished from the sky.

The Sword Spirit spoke abruptly, “You’re going to die!”

Yang Ye nodded, “I know.”

She asked, “What are you planning on doing?”

Yang Ye lowered his head to glance at Yin’yin, and then he rubbed her head, “Don’t be afraid. Even if we’re going to die, you still have me!”

“Yin’yin isn’t afraid while I’m by Big Brother’s side!” replied Yin’yin.

“HAHAHA!!!” Yang Ye roared madly with laughter, and he laughed for quite some time before he looked up at the eye in the sky. His face was covered in madness and ferocity as he said, “One swing of my sword. Either you or I shall die!”

The Sword Spirit gazed at Yang Ye for a short while, and then she transformed into the ancient sheath and floated before Yang Ye. Moreover, there was a sword within the sheath!

“Heavenrend!” Yang Ye took the ancient sheath in his left hand and took the sword’s hilt in his right before he drew it!

Bang! Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

The dozens of dark violet bolts of divine lightning in the air above Yang Ye were instantly blasted into pieces!
