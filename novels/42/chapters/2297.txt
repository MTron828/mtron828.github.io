Chapter 2298 – Emotions Were His Downfall!

At this moment, Bai Zhixian was furious!

Nanli Xian was a True Dao Realm expert of the Nanli Clan. If something happened to him here, White Emperor City wouldn’t be able to avoid responsibility. Moreover, the last remaining friendly relations between them would vanish, and they would become enemies instead.

However, Nanli Xian refused to leave!

He refused!

At this moment, Bao Zhixian was on the verge of being unable to restrain Yang Ye.

Meanwhile, Nanli Xian gazed at Yang Ye. His gaze instantly turned cold when he saw her holding Yang Ye’s hand, and his gaze was filled with hostility.

This hostility made Yang Ye instantly pull free from Bai Zhixian’s grasp.

A moment later, a pitch black sword slashed down from above Nanli Xian.

Nanli Xian was stunned.

Utterly stunned!

He hadn’t expected the black clothed man by Bai Zhixian’s side to just attack him, and he hadn’t expected the man to be this terrifying.

Just one attack!

Just this attack made his hairs stand on end.

Yang Ye’s attack was no ordinary attack, it had been enhanced by True Dao Realm madness intent and the Sword Domain. Coupled with the fact that he was so close to Nanli Xian, the latter had no chance to dodge. Nanli Xian wasn’t able to put up a good counterattack in such a hurry, so he was forced to go on the defensive.

Bang!

A powerful True Dao Realm aura surged out from him. However, it was instantly obliterated upon appearing.

Hiss!

Yang Ye’s sword descended, and Nanli Xian’s body was instantly sliced into two. Meanwhile, his soul escaped his body and fled out of the hall.

Suddenly, a hand grabbed his throat when he’d just arrived at the exit.

It was Bai Zhixian’s hand!

Nanli Xian stared at Bai Zhixian, “If you kill me, the Nanli Clan won’t let White Emperor City live. I’m sure you’re aware of the current situation that White Emperor City is in!”

She replied, “I told you to leave. Unfortunately, you refused. Since you refuse, then die!”

Crush!

As soon as she finished speaking, Nanli Xian’s soul was crushed apart and transformed into countless fragments. But it only took a moment for innumerable vengeful spirits to devour those falling fragments.

Bai Zhixian glanced at Yang Ye and remained silent.

At this moment, she felt that she may have made a mistake. Was it really wise to let Yang Ye stay by her side? Now, it was too late for her to regret her decision. Yang Ye was treating her as An Nanjing, or it should be said that he’d unconsciously taken her to be An Nanjing. If Yang Ye realized that she wasn’t An Nanjing, then he would definitely kill her.

An Nanjing would never do anything that was harmful to Yang Ye, and she would never do anything that would hurt him. So, she couldn’t do anything like that either!

She shook her head and said, “Let’s go!”

She led Yang Ye out of the hall. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

She led him out of the city, and then they shot into the endless starry sky.

The Eternal Secret Realm was only opening in around a month. She didn’t dare to let Yang Ye stay in White Emperor City until then. He was too unstable, and the slightest mistake may cause him to slaughter the entire city.

Yang Ye had to stay away from crowds for now!

…

The Sword Ruins.

Sword Scroll and the others arrived at the Sword Ruins. The Sword Guardian didn’t refuse Su Qingshi and the others’ arrival because of Sword Scroll.

A woman in a linen dress sat cross-legged before a tombstone.

Sword Scroll brought Snowy to her, and the woman’s eyes remained shut as she said, “I won’t leave this place.”

Sword Scroll hesitated for a moment and said, “Please, you’re the only one I know who can firmly suppress him. If you don’t help him, it’ll be very dangerous for him to remain like that.”

The woman shook her head slightly, “Sword Scroll, why force me?”

Sword Scroll fell silent for a long time before she looked the woman in the eyes, “Jian You, I advise you to go.”

Jian You gazed at Sword Scroll, “Are you threatening me?”

Sword Scroll pointed at Snowy, “Take a good look at her! Look carefully!”

Snowy was stunned.

Jian You glanced at Snowy, “I know, she’s a Sprite Lord.”

Sword Scroll spoke louder, “Look carefully!”

Jian You frowned slightly and gazed at Snowy again. It didn’t take long for her gaze to descend onto Snowy’s eyes. As soon as she saw the strand of dark purple in Snowy’s eyes, Jian You’s indifferent expression changed for the first time.

Disbelief filled her eyes, “How can that be?! That’s impossible!”

Sword Scroll took a deep breath, “It’s a fact! Jian You, your Jian Clan has been using its own sword intent and cultivation to repay that sword for generations. Yet now, so long as she’s willing, the shackles on the fate of countless generations of your clan will vanish.”

Jian You stood up slowly and walked over to Snowy, “Give me a promise.”

Snowy blinked and gazed at Sword Scroll, and the latter spoke softly, “If she’s willing to go help Yang Ye, are you willing to help her in the future?”

Snowy hurriedly nodded.

Jian You spoke softly, “Thank you.”

As soon as she finished speaking, she raised the huge sword on her back and left.

“Don’t expose her presence!” Meanwhile, Sword Scroll spoke abruptly, “We don’t have the strength to protect her. If her existence is exposed, she’ll live, but we’ll die!”

Jian You didn’t say a word and just shot off into the distance before finally vanishing.

This year, the Sword Guardian left the Sword Ruins.

Snowy withdrew her gaze and was quite depressed.

Sword Scroll gazed at Snowy, “It’s fine. She’s very strong.”

Snowy glanced at Sword Scroll, and then she nodded slightly. After that, she hesitated for a moment and pointed deep into the Sword Ruins.

Sword Scroll spoke softly, “You’ve sensed it?”

Snowy nodded.

Sword Scroll explained, “It can’t come outside now or it’ll be chaos.”

Snowy waved her claws while a solemn expression appeared on her face.

Sword Scroll walked over to Snowy and smiled, “I know it’s very powerful, and I know it’s very dangerous. However, you don’t have to fear it. Because it will fear you.”

Snowy blinked and was very puzzled.

After all, she wasn’t good at fighting at all!

Sword Scroll looked up at the sky and spoke softly in her heart, “Yang Ye’s greatest fortune in his lifetime was saving you. Of course, it may be his greatest trouble as well. Because you’re wanted by all. Not to mention others, even I want to kill him and take you for myself!”

The desire to kill!

Once she found out that Snowy would become a Sprite Progenitor, she’d really aroused the intent to kill Yang Ye.

…

In the boundless starry sky, Yang Ye and Bai Zhixian traveled for a long time before she finally stopped.

An ancient city stood before them.

The city floated there in space. It was quite old and damaged. Obviously, it had been ravaged in the past.

Bai Zhixian glanced at Yang Ye, hesitated for a moment, and then took his hand. She noticed that so long as she took his hand, Yang Ye would calm down tremendously.

Just like that, she led him to the entrance of the city.

Eternal Immortal City.

Bai Zhixian led him into the city. The city itself was deathly silent.

She glanced at the surroundings, and then led him to a damaged hall. She sat down cross-legged, and Yang Ye stood by her side.

She glanced at him. For some reason, she actually felt a strange sense of safety right now!

A sense of safety!

Previously, when she was enemies with Yang Ye, she’d experienced how terrifying he was. Yang Ye was absolutely not someone who would spare a pretty face, and he would even kill a goddess without the slightest hesitation, if he had to. Zither Maiden from the Immortal Estate was the best example of that!

However, she suddenly realized that if she wasn’t enemies with him, he was very trustworthy.

Unfortunately, he placed too much emphasis on emotions and loyalty, and he took it too seriously.

Emotions were his downfall!

Suddenly, footsteps resounded from outside the hall.

Bai Zhixian moved her gaze away and looked out of the hall. It didn’t take long for a middle aged man and an old man to appear within her vision.

She frowned slightly at the sight of them, but it didn’t take long for her to return to normal.

The middle aged man walked over to her, glanced at Yang Ye, and then said, “White Empress, according to my knowledge, my younger brother, Baili Xian, went to White Emperor City a few days ago, but he still hasn’t returned. Do you know where he is?”

Bai Zhixian replied indifferently, “I don’t!”

The middle aged man’s face turned cold, “Bai Zhixian, I’ll stop beating around the bust. My brother is dead, and I want to know if it was White Emperor City’s doing.”

Bai Zhixian asked, “Nanli Yu, you think I killed him?”

Nanli Yu replied indifferently, “I didn’t say that.”

Bai Zhixian replied, “That’s what you said. So, tell me, what reason would I have to kill him?”

Nanli Yu looked her in the eyes, “That’s what I want to know too. Because he never left White Emperor City. So, he definitely died in the city, right?”

Bai Zhixian spoke indifferently, “Would you believe me if I said no?”

Nanli Yu gazed at her for a long time and smiled, “Very good. Bai Zhixian, we’ll have a good chat about it in the Eternal Secret Realm!”

He turned around and walked away with the old man.

Bai Zhixian’s face remained expressionless, and she held tightly onto Yang Ye’s hand.

Meanwhile, divine senses swept the area from time to time.

A short while later, Bai Zhixian released her grip on Yang Ye’s hand and spoke softly, “My White Emperor City was once on par with the Immortal Estate. At our peak, we had two extraordinary geniuses. Unfortunately, there was no place for two tigers in one mountain. Our ancestors fought each other, and the experts of our clan either died or left. Now, we’re far inferior from what we used to be.”

She gazed at Yang Ye and continued, “All those years ago, Eternal Border didn’t just have one estate, two cities, three sects, and six clans. There were many other powers. However, they gradually vanished. Now, if I can’t improve my strength in this secret realm, White Emperor City will gradually vanish too.”

Yang Ye remained silent, but a black sword had appeared in his grasp.

Bai Zhixian gazed at him for a long time. At this moment, she envied An Nanjing a little.

Suddenly, another divine sense swept the area, and Yang Ye vanished abruptly.

Bai Zhixian was shocked. She was about to charge outside, but a loud shout that was filled with shock resounded, “You’re Yang Ye! AH!”

The shout was like muffled thunder that resounded throughout the city.

Bai Zhixian had just charged out of the hall when Yang Ye appeared before her, and in his hand was a bloody head.
