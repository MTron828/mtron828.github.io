Chapter 2684 – Changes in the Sword Heart!

At the instant they attacked, Yang Ye attacked too.

Yang Ye’s attack was slightly slower than theirs!

Just slightly!

Three rays of light flashed.

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss Hiss!

The sound of something being sliced open resounded.

A moment later, the surroundings fell silent.

Two streams of blood sprayed from Yang Ye’s chest and left abdomen.

However, a mark had appeared on the foreheads of all three wooden figures.

The three wooden figures had stopped, and Yang Ye had stopped as well!

Past Life was on the ground.

It wasn’t that it had fallen, it was that his right arm had fallen.

He’d lost his right arm!

Now, he had no arms at all!

A few breaths of time later, the wooden figures moved aside, and their leader bowed slightly to Yang Ye. Yang Ye nodded and walked over to the box.

The box opened automatically, and a white figure floated out of it.

It was the woman in white.

However, she was ethereal. Obviously, it wasn’t her real body!

She gazed at Yang Ye who was simply unrecognizable now, and she grinned, “You’re here.”

Yang Ye nodded.

His entire body was covered in injuries, and he couldn’t even speak now. He knew that he would definitely be incapable of recognizing himself.

He was in a horrifying state!

She gently moved aside Yang Ye’s blood red hair that was covering his eyes and spoke softly, “Come with me!”

Yang Ye walked out of the hall with her.

The sky was blood red outside. It was sunset.

She spoke softly, “The Past Life Clan, it’s a place I once stayed. I had many lovely memories here. In the end, I personally wiped out all the experts here.”

Yang Ye looked at her.

She smiled, “In the past, I felt the Destiny Realm expert didn’t have to die. I could join forces with them and coexist in the Three Dimensional Universe. That was my original intention. I’d almost convinced my black form, but…”

She shook her head and smiled as she sat on the stone stairs, and she fell silent for a while before she continued, “There were once 10 clans in this world. The Past Life Clan was one of them. Besides the Sprites of the nine layers of space, they could be considered to be the strongest in this universe. They had wild ambition, especially the Past Life Clan. Because they possessed the Past Life Energy, and their strength was merely inferior to another clan, the Yang Clan.”

“The Yang Clan?” Yang Ye couldn’t help but ask. However, as soon as he opened his mouth, it felt like it was being torn open.

It was fucking painful!

She nodded slightly, “The Yang Clan, a clan of humans. Actually, they were part of the human race, but their patriarch was a little special. She forcefully separated them from the human race and made the universe acknowledge them as an independent clan.”

She glanced at Yang Ye’s stomach and said, “The one within you, Erya, is cultivating a technique she once created.”

Yang Busi!

At this moment, Yang Ye knew who she was talking about.

The woman in white smiled, “That woman was absolutely formidable. Unfortunately…”

She shook her head slightly and returned to the previous topic, “I stayed in the Past Life Clan. I planned to change the way their experts thought. I told them not to enter the Four Dimensional Universe as it would only lead to death. Because they didn’t have the strength to survive there. Unfortunately, they refused to listen, and they even targeted me.”

Yang Ye gazed at her, “What do you mean?”

She smiled, “They used my trust in them to trap me within a formation. They wanted to enslave me…”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

She continued, “They wanted to use my strength to help them break through the Three Dimensional Universe and send them into the Four Dimensional Universe.”

Yang Ye shook his head.

Wasn’t that no different than courting death?

The woman in white did look very amiable and not dangerous at all, never forget that she was one of Destiny’s forms too!

So, wasn’t targeting her no different than courting death?

Meanwhile, she continued, “I gave them a chance. Unfortunately, they didn’t cherish it. They destroyed the good impression of them that I had, and so I annihilated all their Destiny Realm experts.”

Yang Ye asked softly, “What about the ordinary people?”

She smiled, “I didn’t kill them. But once they lost their Destiny Realm experts, they weren’t even comparable to third-rate powers, and so they fled for their lives. As time passed, this place turned into a wasteland, and I only come here occasionally.”

Yang Ye fell silent.

She glanced at him, “You know… After that incident, I realized that coexisting in peace was impossible. Everyone has wild ambition. They seek to go higher upon attaining the Destiny Realm, and that is very normal. Unfortunately…”

Yang Ye asked, “Unfortunately what?”

She smiled, “They aren’t aware of the dangers in the outside world. They think it’s very good. But in actuality, it isn’t good at all.”

She stood up at this point and looked up at the sky, “Do you think I’m selfish?”

Yang Ye still remained silent.

She smiled, “I had to because all of you would die if I didn’t be selfish!”

Yang Ye asked again, “What do you mean?”

She smiled, “Remember those eyes from before?”

Yang Ye nodded.

Those eyes that had pursued the woman in black.

She smiled, “I’m its main target. But if I’m not there, who do you think it will target next?”

Yang Ye was stunned.

She suddenly chuckled, but her laughter was quite desolate, “In the past, I slaughtered the Heaven Dao, and brought freedom to the living beings of the Three Dimensional Universe. Many like-minded people died during that battle, and I’m practically the only one who survived. It wasn’t that I refused to save them, but I was helpless then. The strength of the Three Dimensional Universe’s former Heaven Dao is beyond your imagination.”

She shook her head and smiled, “However, the later generations treated me as their greatest enemy… Why am I telling you all of this…?”

She sat down and fell silent.

A long time passed before Yang Ye broke the silence, “It’s very complicated.”

The woman in white nodded slightly, “It is. Let’s let get into that. You’ve passed two tests, but it’s only the beginning. There are more. Go forward, and your test will end once you arrive before a teleportation formation.”

Her figure gradually turned ethereal as she spoke.

Right when she was about to disappear completely, she suddenly gazed at Yang Ye, “You didn’t use any profound energy. I’m proud of you. So, here’s a small reward!”

A strand of mysterious profound energy enveloped him!

Polaris Energy!

A form of profound energy that was greater than the Primordial Violet Energy!

In an instant, his injuries started to heal at a practically visible rate. Moreover, his arms were gradually growing.

Finally, he was back to normal!

Yang Ye seemed to have thought of something and hurriedly asked, “A woman called Tu came here and bashed me up. Who is she?”

Tu!

The woman in white grinned, and her smile seemed to carry deep secrets within it, “It’s your fault for tossing something of hers!” She vanished completely once she finished speaking.

I tossed something of hers?

Yang Ye was quite stunned!

She didn’t tell him the answer clearly and just kept him guessing instead.

A short while later, Yang Ye stopped thinking about it, and he just walked into the hall with Past Life and arrived before the three wooden figures once more.

Continue training!

Even though he’d won by losing an arm just now, it was partially luck that allowed him to win. Of course, most importantly, he wanted to continue fighting and truly fight to his heart’s content against them!

The battle began once more!

Rays of light crisscrossed through the hall.

Just like that, Yang Ye fought the three wooden figures in the hall for almost a month before finally leaving.

A month!

Yang Ye knew that this sword had undergone a change.

Because at the later stages of his training, even fighting the three wooden figures with a stick wouldn’t make a huge difference.

The only difference was that Past Life was harder than a stick, and it had a spirit of its own.

In short, perhaps swords were no different to some people, but there was a difference between swords.

Yang Ye left the hall and continued onward.

This time, he had some confidence.

This confidence he had was slightly different from the confidence he once possessed. In the past, it came from his cultivation and the various divine treasures he possessed, yet now, it merely came from the sword in his grasp!

It was confidence that was much purer than any form of confidence he once possessed.

Suddenly, something unexpected occurred.

Yang Ye suddenly looked to the side, and a huge fist slammed down at him!

Yang Ye saw it clearly.

It was the statue that he’d just met upon arriving in this world. Obviously, it had been lying in ambush here.

Yang Ye’s face remained indifferent as he watched it shoot toward him. At this moment, he felt that it was full of flaws!

Full of them!

Yang Ye shook his head slightly. With just a slight movement to the side, the fist just barely shot past his face. At the same time, a sword stabbed into the back of the fist and moved along it…

Hiss!

In an instant, the statue’s arm was sliced open. Moreover, Yang Ye was in front of the statue.

His sword flashed!

Hiss!

A sword pierced through the statue’s nether regions!

Yang Ye waved his right hand from behind the statue, and the sword flew into his grasp. After that, he walked off into the distance.

The statue suddenly fell to its knees behind Yang Ye, and he held its nether regions tightly while howling incessantly in pain.Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m
