Chapter 2063 – Laws!

At this moment, Yang Ye felt a little horrified. It felt just like when he met the evil treasure for the first time.

He was never a coward, but this had nothing to do with courage and cowardice. Besides curiosity, most people had a trace of fear towards the unknown.

Yang Ye calmed himself and gazed at the casket. Its lid was open, but no one emerged from within.

“That was once our home!” The voice spoke abruptly, “A long time ago, the universe expanded and exploded, and then countless universes, planes, and dimensions appeared. However, all of them were without any life.”

The voice stopped at this point.

Yang Ye glanced at the casket, “What happened after that?”

“After that…” The voice from the casket continued, “In the beginning, life appeared on that planet of ours. After countless years of evolution and reproduction, they gained intelligence, and then they started to create. After that, martial civilizations, cultivation civilizations, and technological civilizations appeared.”

Yang Ye asked, “Why did they all vanish in the end?”

“Plundering!” The voice spoke softly, “A galaxy doesn’t have endless resources. So, regardless of which type of civilization it was, they were established on the basis of madly plundering the resources of their home planet. In the beginning, just a single planet couldn’t endure it, but soon, the galaxy followed. In the end, it affected the entire universe.”

Yang Ye looked right at the casket, “What happened next?”

“Destruction!” The voice replied softly, “All these civilizations felt that they could overcome the universe, and the universe was endless. So, they could plunder without end.”

The voice paused for a moment at this point and asked, “Do you think it’s right to plunder like that?”

Yang Ye remained silent.

Right? Wrong?

It was difficult to say for sure. Every living being had to plunder the planet in order to survive and grow. Just like Yang Ye, he was plundering the spirit energy of the world, but he would die if he stopped. It was the same for the other civilizations.

As far as the universe was concerned, their actions were wrong, but as far as they were concerned, they weren’t wrong!

Meanwhile, the voice added, “The universe is alive. So, it would naturally not allow us to just take madly from it. However, as far as those civilizations were concerned, the universe could be subdued. The power of man surpasses the heavens. It was a very popular thing to say. However, the result was that civilization after civilization vanished.”

Yang Ye spoke solemnly, “Who did it? The spirit of this universe?”

“The spirit of this universe?” The voice said, “In the beginning, we thought the same way, but that wasn’t true… There are too many unknown things in the boundless reaches of the universe.”

Yang Ye wanted to ask more, but the voice suddenly asked, “You’re human?”

Yang Ye nodded, “Yes!”

The voice spoke softly, “When we left all those years ago, sages prophesied that Milky Way System will give birth to new life, and that new life will become the owner of Milky Way System. If I’m not wrong, it should be you humans. How far developed are you?” ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

How far? Yang Ye didn’t know how to answer the question.

Meanwhile, the voice resounded once more, “Are you strong or weak among humans?”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and replied, “Not very strong, but not very weak either!”

“So you’re ordinary!” The voice continued, “Then the humans still have a long path ahead.”

Yang Ye spoke softly, “Did all of you go somewhere else, or have you vanished from this universe?”

The voice fell silent for quite some time before it spoke again, “We moved… We started to move all those years ago, and we went to a different universe. However, in the end we noticed that our fate remained unchanged. Finally, countless sages sacrificed their lives to unearth the secrets in the depths of the universe, and we discovered something!”

Yang Ye asked, “The way to survive?”

“Laws!” The voice spoke softly, “On a planet, there are laws of nature. These laws are like life, death, sickness, age, the seasons, the sun after the rain… They are all part of the laws of nature. As for outer space, it has its own laws of the universe. Those civilizations of the past could overcome those laws of nature, but according to my knowledge, no civilization has been able to overcome the laws of the universe!”

Yang Ye’s curiosity was aroused, “What are the laws of the universe?”

The voice fell silent.

Yang Ye glanced at the casket. Is that fellow going to keep me guessing?

Meanwhile, the voice said, “I sense something with you, something that can give karmic luck. Looks like you humans have grasped the ethereal concept of karmic luck, but the faster you progress, it may lead to a faster demise.”

“Senior!” Yang Ye took a step forward and said, “Since you’ve experienced that destruction, why don’t you tell us the reason so that we don’t follow in your footsteps?”

Even though he was a selfish person, he felt that he should ask about it for the sake of the entire human race. As for whether she would tell him, that was her problem. He’d done his part by asking.

“Would you believe me if I did?” Her voice was soft, “Even if you did, would all of you change? Would you give up cultivating? No, just like we refused.”

Yang Ye fell silent because he couldn’t deny it.

Meanwhile, the voice continued, “Life, death, age, and sickness are part of the laws of nature. However, we overcame them through cultivation and technology. Just thinking about it, if a planet could only house 100 million, but those 100 million suddenly stopped dying and reproduced instead. What do you think would happen to the planet?”

Yang Ye replied, “Destruction!”

The voice said, “Or to explain it on a larger scale, everyone in the universe won’t die, or it will take a very long time for them to die. In the beginning, this may not be a problem, but what about 10,000 or 100,000 years later?”

Yang Ye laughed bitterly, “So, we’re doomed?”

The voice replied, “In the past, there were three types of people who could survive beneath the laws of the universe. The first was those who were extremely weak like ordinary people. The universe is fair. The more you take from it, the more you must return. But the ordinary people hadn’t taken anything, so they naturally had no reason to return anything.”

Yang Ye asked, “What about the other two types of people?”

The voice explained, “Another type are the sprites that are protected by the world. They are born with the universe and are a part of it. So, not only is their existence of no harm to the universe, they bring great benefits to it instead. They are able to survive too.”

Yang Ye asked, “What about the last?”

“Those with great karmic luck!” The voice continued, “Those people are just like the sprites, and they are protected by the world. So, it’s easy for them to survive. You possess a treasure that can provide its owner with karmic luck, so you may be in big trouble in the future.”

The Primordial Pagoda!

Yang Ye knew that she was talking about the pagoda. It was bringing karmic luck to him now, but at the same time, it brought countless problems to him too.

Meanwhile, the voice suddenly said, “Human, it’s time for you to leave!”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and asked, “Senior, what are you doing here?”

The voice replied, “I’ve been in deep sleep for too long, and I merely wanted to have a look lately. But I never expected that I would alarm some people. Now, I have to go into hiding again. After all, I don’t want to get mixed up in the current civilization.”

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and said, “Senior, do you have any Originite? Can I have one?”

“Originite? What’s that?” The voice carried a trace of surprise.

Yang Ye was slightly stunned, and then he hurriedly said, “It’s your combat techniques or cultivation techniques.”

The voice fell silent for quite some time, and then a crystalline and translucent rock appeared before Yang Ye, “Inheritance Stones. I don’t know if you’ll like what’s in it. Anyway, that’s the only one I have.”

Yang Ye quickly took it and said, “Thank you!”

“Human!” The voice spoke abruptly, “Can you help me with something?”

Yang Ye asked, “With what?”

“The spirit energy stored within here is growing scarcer and scarcer, and it’s insufficient to keep me alive. So, can you bring more to me? I don’t need too much.”

Yang Ye smiled, “Of course!” It wasn’t a big deal to him, so he naturally wouldn’t refuse.

“Thank you!” The casket’s lid slowly covered the casket once the voice finished speaking.

Yang Ye cupped his fist in its direction, and then he left. He encountered the demon beast at the entrance, but it was seated at the corner and held no ill intent towards him anymore. Yang Ye nodded slightly and vanished into the distance.

The demon beast glanced at the direction Yang Ye had left towards and laid flat on the ground.

Meanwhile, the casket had been fully covered.

A short while passed, and then a soft voice resounded, “So a million years have passed… Another cycle, and another era. Who will be the lucky one this time?”
