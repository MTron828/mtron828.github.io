Chapter 1351 – Just Run If You Really Can’t!

The one who destroyed Sword God’s Palace was here!

Moreover, Yang Ye felt that he’d even met that person. Because the voice he heard was truly too familiar!

Yang Ye turned around and looked towards the distance. The space there suddenly cracked open, and then a grey robed old man walked out from within it. Yang Ye’s pupils constricted at the sight of the old man.

It was Jian Xu!

The old man before him was Jian Xu!”

“How could this be possible?” Yang Ye’s eyes were filled with disbelief, Jian Xu was the mysterious expert who destroyed Sword God’s Palace?

Meanwhile, Blind Maiden gazed at Jian Xu and said, “After hiding for thousands of years, you’re finally willing to show yourself?”

Jian Xu spoke indifferently, “Didn’t you seize the Stellar Sword Diagram all those years ago to make me show myself?”

Blind Maiden nodded and said, “Both of you are here now, so let’s resolve everything today.” As soon as she finished speaking, the space around her suddenly started to tremble.

“There’s something I don’t understand!” Meanwhile, Jian Xu suddenly said, “Blind Maiden, according to my knowledge, there’s no connection between you and the Sword God’s Palace, and there’s no relationship between you and Jian Wuji as well. So, why are you taking revenge for the Sword God’s Palace? I’ve thought about it throughout these years but have never figured it out. Could it be that you’re really doing this for that insignificant outer court disciple?”

As soon as Jian Xu finished speaking, Yang Ye noticed Blind Maiden’s expression instantly turned cold, or it should be called quite ferocious. At the same time, monstrous killing intent appeared out of nowhere. This seemingly solid killing intent was extremely terrifying, and even someone like Yang Ye who’d comprehended Void Rank slaughter intent was almost affected by it!

“Looks like it’s the truth!” Jian Xu chuckled and waved his right hand slightly. A translucent circle of light swept out from him, and then the killing intent around him instantly vanished without a trace. After that, he gazed at Blind Maiden and said, “I never expected an expert at your level to actually trap yourself here for so long, just for the sake of an insignificant outer court disciple of Sword God’s Palace! You really were love-struck!”

Blind Maiden clenched her fists tightly, “It has been so long. It’s time you have your release, and I should have mine as well. Let’s put an end to it today.”

A cold smile curled up on the corners of Jian Xu’s mouth, “We really should.”

Bang!

As soon as he finished speaking, a terrifying strand of sword intent surged out explosively from within him, and then Yang Ye’s expression instantly changed drastically.

The Quasi Returnal Rank!

Jian Xu’s sword intent was actually at the Quasi Returnal Rank!

Blind Maiden frowned slightly, but it didn’t take long for her brows to relax, “No wonder you dared to show yourself. So you attained Quasi Returnal Rank sword intent.”

“The Quasi Returnal Rank?” Jian Xu chuckled, “For now. It’ll be at the true Returnal Rank soon.”

Blind Maiden didn’t say anything, and she was about to attack instead. However, Yang Ye suddenly appeared by her side, and she frowned when she noticed his arrival, “You’re no match for them.”

Yang Ye replied, “It’s too unfair if they fight you 2 on 1.” Even though her strength was heaven defying, he’d realized that while she would definitely win in single combat against the dragon or Jian Xu, she would definitely have no chance to win in a 2 on 1 battle. So, he had to step forward.

“Don’t be anxious, you won’t be able to escape as well!” Meanwhile, Jian Xu’s gaze descended onto Yang Ye, and he said, “Actually, you’ve truly surprised me. I’m extremely surprised. I have to admit that since my senior brother, Jian Wuji, your natural talent really is the best in the history of Dark Hell Continent. No, I should say that your natural talent has surpassed my senior brother.”

“Your senior brother!” Yang Ye glanced at Jian Xu, “Jian Wuji was your senior brother?!”

“Are you that surprised?” Jian Xu smiled, “Yang Ye, I actually really admire you. Especially the way you do things. I think that a person like you is what a true sword cultivator is like. As for my senior brother, he stubbornly adhered to outworn ideas. Righteousness? Justice? I hate all that nonsense of his.”

Yang Ye said, “So you destroyed his Sword God’s Palace!”

“Of course I did!” Jian Xu had a ferocious expression on his face, “He was always there to push me down while he lived. Everything good in the Sword God’s Palace was his to use first. Everyone knew about him, Jian Wuji, yet no one knew about me, Jian Xu. Fine, my strength was inferior to his, so it’s normal for all the good treasures like the Sword God’s Seal to be his.”

Yang Ye was quite puzzled, “Since you understand, then why did you destroy Sword God’s Palace?!”

Jian Xu’s face grew even more vicious, “Everything within the Sword God’s Palace was his while he lived, and I accepted that because I was weaker. However, Sword God’s Palace should have been under my control once he died, and the Sword God’s Seal should have been mine. However, do you know what his will was? He willed that I, Jian Xu, shouldn’t be allowed to control Sword God’s Palace, and the Sword God’s Seal and Stellar Sword Diagram shouldn’t fall into my hands! He didn’t want me to find out the secrets of the Sword Domain, and he didn’t want me to surpass him one day. Hahaha!”

Jian Xu gradually grew insane as he finished speaking.

Yang Ye glanced at Jian Xu, touched the Sword God’s Seal on his forehead, and said, “You made me head to Sword God’s palace to make me get the Sword God’s Seal? Because you’ll be able to attain true Returnal Rank sword intent once you have it, right?”

“You’re very smart!” Jian Xu smiled, “Actually, I just wanted to give it a try. Because that woman by your side hates sword cultivators to the bone. But I never expected you to actually go there and bring the Sword God’s Seal back. You truly surprised me. Of course, I felt even more pleasantly surprised. However, the greatest pleasant surprise I got was that the Sword God’s Seal had actually destroyed its own consciousness. Hahaha! Even the heavens were helping me. After all, it would be very troublesome to subdue it if its consciousness was still intact.”

Yang Ye glanced at Jian Xu and said, “I still don’t understand something. I got the Sword God’s Seal a long time ago, and your strength far surpasses mine. So why didn’t you seize it?”

“He didn’t dare to!” It was Blind Maiden who spoke, “Your strength isn’t weak. He would have to expose his true strength in order to take it from you. So long as he did, I would find out immediately. The only reason he has dared to show himself now is because that demonic dragon has recovered from its injuries and grown much stronger.”

Jian Xu laughed coldly, “It’s not too late to take it now!”

Yang Ye gazed at Blind Maiden and laughed bitterly, “Would I be putting you in deep trouble if he gains the Sword God’s Seal?”

Blind Maiden was frank, “Yes!”

The corners of Yang Ye’s mouth twitched slightly. He looked up at the dragon in the sky and said, “Both of them were no match for you all those years ago, so why didn’t you kill that big fellow?”

Blind Maiden pondered deeply for a moment before she said, “It hid deep down at the bottom of the ocean. I wouldn’t be able to kill it if I fought it within the ocean. Moreover, if we did fight there, the ocean water here would flood the continent. Besides that, the core of the earth would explode apart as well. At that time, Dark Hell Continent would vanish completely. This is his home, and I don’t want it destroyed!”

Yang Ye nodded. Indeed, if Blind Maiden and the dragon didn’t fight high above in the sky, their strength was entirely capable of obliterating the entire continent.

Suddenly, Jian Xu looked up at the dragon and said, “Keep that woman busy. Just around 10 minutes will be enough.”

“Alright!” As soon as the dragon finished speaking, its claws shot down from above and clawed at Yang Ye and Blind Maiden.

Blind Maiden gazed at Yang Ye and said, “How long can you hold on for?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “I don’t know!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he gazed at Blind Maiden and asked, “How long do you need to deal with that big fellow?”

Blind Maiden replied, “I don’t know as well!”

Yang Ye was speechless.

Blind Maiden patted him lightly on the shoulder and said, “If you really can’t hold on, then run. I won’t blame you for doing that!” As soon as she finished speaking, she transformed into a ray of light that shot up into the sky.

Run? Yang Ye laughed bitterly. Would Jian Xu let him run? Definitely not. Of course, Jian Xu might let him run away if he handed the Sword God’s Seal over obediently. But if he did that, wouldn’t it be equivalent to coming here and causing trouble for Blind Maiden? Moreover, the Sword God’s Seal belonged to him now. So, give it away? Impossible!

“Based on my understanding of you, you will definitely not just hand it over to me. So, I’ll get it myself!” Jian Xu walked slowly in Yang Ye’s direction. Every single step he took was accompanied by a strand of sword intent that surged out from within him. The sword intent didn’t attack Yang Ye and just surged around Yang Ye, and they surrounded him. Obviously, Jian Xu was worried that Yang Ye would flee. Even though he could catch up to Yang Ye, it would be a waste of time.

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings. Once the Quasi Returnal Rank sword intent arrived around him, his own sword intent retreated and stopped right in front of him. However, his sword intent hadn’t shrunk back into his body. Sword intent had a consciousness as well, and it was very well aware of Yang Ye’s temper. If it didn’t even dare to face Jian Xu’s sword intent, then Yang Ye might ignite his sword intent and burn it away again.

After all, Yang Ye had done that on Sword God Mountain!

It was fine to be no match for something, but it was an embarrassment to not even dare to try and fight. That was something that Yang Ye refused to tolerate as well!

So, even if Jian Xu’s sword intent was stronger than Yang Ye’s sword intent, it still didn’t shrink back into his body.

It didn’t take long for Jian Xu to arrive around 30m away from Yang Ye, and he said, “The Sword God’s Seal can improve one’s sword intent. Aren’t you going to improve yours? If you don’t, then the suppressive effects of my sword intent will cause you to be unable to fight back against me. Right?”

Yang Ye looked up at the sky. At this moment, Blind Maiden was clearly not holding back, and the entire sky was covered in flowing rays of light. At this moment, the black dragon’s enormous figure had become a living punching bag, and it was completely suppressed before Blind Maiden’s frenzied attacks. The black dragon’s defeat was only a matter of time! Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Yang Ye remained silent for an instant before he looked up at Jian Xu, “Everyone says that I’m the number one sword cultivator of the continent. Actually, you are the best. Come, let me see how strong Jian Wuji’s former junior brother is!”

Jian Xu glanced at the ancient sheath in Yang Ye’s grasp and nodded, “Then bring it on!”

“Bring it on!” As soon as Yang Ye finished speaking, he grabbed the hilt of his sword and drew it!
