Chapter 2153 – Star Gate!

This scene surpassed Yang Ye’s expectations.

Because as far as he was concerned, Snowy was quite afraid of the small black ball, yet now, she’d taken the initiative to attack!

After she slapped it away, Snowy didn’t stop and flew over to it again, and then she slapped it away again.

Bam!

The black ball was slapped flying once more!

However, Yang Ye was astounded to see that the little black ball didn’t choose to fight back!

It wasn’t fighting back!

A short while later, Snowy stopped and returned to Yang Ye’s side, and then she cracked a smile at him.

Yang Ye rubbed her little head and spoke softly, “Why is it afraid of you?”

Snowy waved her little claws while pride covered her face.

Obviously, she was saying that she was very strong!

Yang Ye shook his head and smiled. Actually, he’d guessed that the black ball was probably a type of Sprite, a being like a Sprite King. Because only such beings would fear Snowy that much.

Meanwhile, the black ball suddenly floated over to them.

Snowy glared at it, and the latter seemed slightly fearful and moved backward.

Yang Ye gazed at the little black ball and was about to speak when a young voice resounded in his mind, “Afraid, afraid…”

Afraid!

Yang Ye was stunned, and then quite a weird expression appeared on his face. It can speak?

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and said, “Don’t be afraid, she won’t harm you!”

He gazed at Snowy at this point and said, “Right?” He winked at Snowy while he spoke.

Snowy blinked, and then she nodded.

Yang Ye grinned, and then he walked over to the black ball, “You can speak?”

The black ball spoke softly, “Y-Yes, a little…”

Yang Ye asked, “What are you?”

The little black ball was at a loss for words.

Yang Ye smiled embarrassedly and gazed at Snowy, “Snowy, talk to it and find out what it is, and what it’s doing here at the center of the black hole!”

Snowy nodded and started speaking to it.

In the beginning, the black ball was clearly quite afraid of Snowy, but once it saw that Snowy had no intent to attack it, it wasn’t that afraid anymore.

A long time passed before Yang Ye finally gained an understanding of the little fellow’s origins.

The spirit of the black hole!

It was the spirit of this black hole.

Yang Ye was quite surprised because it actually had a spirit, and it made him wonder if every single one of the black holes had a spirit of its own.

“H-Help…” Meanwhile, the black ball’s voice resounded in Yang Ye’s mind.

Help? Yang Ye glanced at it, and then he gazed at Snowy, “What does it need our help with?”

Snowy gazed at the black ball and started talking to it again. A short while passed before Snowy gazed at Yang Ye and started waving her claws.

Yang Ye’s face instantly became solemn once he understood what she was telling him.

Destruction!

The black ball was saying that this place was about to be destroyed!

According to his inference, the destruction it was speaking about was probably the End Times. He hadn’t expected that it would actually affect the spirit of the black hole. According to his inference from this, the End Times may affect the living beings throughout this universe!

Why does the End Times exist? This question appeared in Yang Ye’s mind again. He’d gained some answers before this, and those answers were rebirth, destruction, the cycles of reincarnation!

Humans are reborn, die, and enter the cycle of reincarnation. The universe does the same!

It was a so-called law of the universe!

It was something that no living being could escape!

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts and gazed at Snowy, “Ask it how we should help it!”

Since it was asking for him, perhaps it knew a way.

Snowy nodded and started talking to it again.

A long time passed before Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly, “Snowy, you’re saying that it wants us to take it with us and flee?”

Snowy nodded.

Yang Ye hurriedly asked Snowy, “Run where?”

Snowy gazed at the black ball and started talking to it again.

.

A long time passed before she gazed at Yang Ye and waved her claws swiftly.

“The Star Gate?” Yang Ye frowned, “It said to flee through the Star Gate?”

Snowy nodded.

Yang Ye asked, “Where is the Star Gate?”

Snowy shook her head.

The black ball didn’t know.

Yang Ye walked over to it and asked, “How do you know about that Star Gate?”

The black ball didn’t choose to talk to Yang Ye, and it chose to talk to Snowy instead.

An hour later, Yang Ye figured out everything.

The black ball was telling Snowy and him to take it and flee to the Star Gate. As for why it knew about the Star Gate, it was because some people and living beings had fled through it in the past. It may have been countless years ago, and it may have been during the prehistoric times.

The black ball already existed at that time, and it had even come into contact with the prehistoric race.

Actually, according to Yang Ye’s own guesses, it existed at the edge, the edge of destruction and new life, and that was why it had been able to escape the previous calamity!

But this time, it wasn’t going to be so lucky.

The Star Gate!

As far as Yang Ye was concerned, finding out about the Star Gate made this trip absolutely worth it. At the very least, he had a clear objective, and it was to search for the Star Gate. Unfortunately, it didn’t know where the Star Gate was.

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts and gazed at Snowy, “Ask it if it’s willing to leave with us.”

Snowy gazed at the black ball, and the latter floated over to them to display its agreement.

Actually, it was mainly because of Snowy.

Snowy would be incomparably helpful during the End Times. It could be said that all living beings wouldn’t hesitate to go with her during the End Times.

Just like that, Yang Ye and Snowy successfully tricked a Black Hole Spirit to follow them.

Snowy led the black ball into the Primordial Pagoda, but it only took a moment for it to be driven out.

It was naturally the pagoda’s spirit that had done it!

Yang Ye entered the pagoda, and then he went over to Snowy and the pagoda’s spirit. After conversing for a while, he finally figures out the reason. It was because the black ball had started to devour the world in the Primordial Pagoda, and the pagoda’s spirit hadn’t been paying attention, so it had almost devoured the entire world within the 1st level of the Primordial Pagoda.

Yang Ye and Snowy left the pagoda, and then they stared at the black ball while the latter shivered.

Yang Ye couldn’t really bear to continue as he looked at how pitiable it seemed, even Snowy couldn’t as well. She went over to it and started educating it.

Actually, the Black Hole Spirit hadn’t done it on purpose, and it had done so instinctively. As far as it was concerned, devouring the matter of the outsider world would make it stronger, so it instinctively started to devour.

In the end, after Snowy finished educating it, the black ball realized its mistakes, and then Snowy took it back into the pagoda. This time, the pagoda’s spirit didn’t drive it out again.

However, the Black Hole Spirit still remained quite careful. There were too many extraordinary figures in this world, especially the young girl before it, Tian Xiu. The black ball didn’t dare to get close to her at all, and it made Tian Xiu rather depressed.

Yang Ye left the black hole, and he noticed that it seemed quite dead when he left it. Actually, the Black Hole Spirit was its core. The Black Hole Spirit could still survive after leaving the black hole, and it could create a new black hole at any time. However, the black hole would gradually vanish without its spirit!

Once he left the black hole, Yang Ye didn’t choose to explore the next black hole. He went to the prehistoric ruins instead.

Once he entered the hall, Yang Ye arrived before the casket. Meanwhile, the prehistoric expert’s voice came from within it, “Your cultivation is really advancing by leaps and bounds, and your natural talent can be described as monstrous! It’s rare even during our time!”

“You’re too kind!” Yang Ye smiled, “I came here because I have something to ask you, Senior. I think you may know the answer I seek.”

The prehistoric expert replied, “Tell me about it!”

“The Star Gate!” Yang Ye spoke solemnly, “You should know about it, right?”

As soon as he finished speaking, the surroundings fell silent.

The prehistoric expert remained silent. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

A long time passed yet the prehistoric expert still didn’t speak again.

At this moment, Yang Ye knew that the prehistoric expert definitely knew something.

Suddenly, the prehistoric expert asked, “How do you find out about the Star Gate?”

Yang Ye said, “By chance.”

The prehistoric expert said, “There should be very, very few people or beings that know of it. Especially in your era. I’m afraid even some progenitors do not know of its existence! I’m really surprised that you do.”

Yang Ye asked, “Senior, do you know where it is?”

The prehistoric expert replied, “If you’re thinking of fleeing this universe through it, then I’m afraid you’ll be disappointed!”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Why?”

The prehistoric expert explained, “Do you know what the Star Gate is? It’s a gate through the starry sky. It’s a mysterious gate that exists in space, and it randomly appears throughout the universe. The large universe was lucky that it appeared in this large universe all those years ago. Of course, it was also the fruit of labor from countless living beings in this large universe. The one who contributed the most was the Sprite Lord of that time. She used her supreme divine ability to contact the Star Gate and sacrificed a lot to make it descend here. However…”

The prehistoric expert fell silent.

Yang Ye asked, “However what?”

The prehistoric expert continued, “However, the Star Gate isn’t a gate to life. It is a teleportation portal, but it may hasten your death.”

Suddenly, the casket’s lid popped open, and then a blurry figure floated up slowly from within it, “My prehistoric race was not born in this large universe, we were teleported over here through the Star Gate. And then, we almost went extinct!”

Yang Ye was stunned speechless.
