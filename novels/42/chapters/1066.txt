Chapter 1067 – Shameless!

Yu Qing was the person in charge of Cloud Merchant Group’s affairs in Cloud City. At this moment, he had an extremely unsightly expression on his face because he’d never expected someone to actually dare to cause trouble on their Cloud Shuttle. Especially at a time like this. Just thinking about the gaze that existence in room no.1 shot at him made him feel like killing someone. After all, years of hard work might go down the drain today!

Room 20!

It came from there!

Yu Qing led a group of over a dozen old men as he rushed towards room 20 with a gloomy expression on his face. He’d just arrived when the door was suddenly opened from the inside, and then a man in green clothes charged out while shouting, “What’s going on? What the hell is going on? Why has the spirit energy in my room vanished? Why? Why has this happened!”

Yu Qing and the others were at a loss for words.

Meanwhile, the green clothed man suddenly gazed at Yu Qing, “Are you the person in charge on this Cloud Shuttle?”

Yu Qing unconsciously nodded.

“Why has the spirit energy within my room vanished?” The green clothed man ran over to Yu Qing and roared furiously, “Do you know that I paid 20 violet crystals for it because I hoped to cultivate here and charge into the Saint Realm? However, all the spirit energy in there has suddenly vanished. Tell me! Tell me! Was it your Cloud Merchant Group that did it? Are you scamming away our violet crystals? Are you?”

Because of the incident, the guests in many rooms had walked out of their rooms, and their gazes instantly descended onto Yu Qing when they heard the green clothed man. These gazes carried both doubt and uncertainty.

Yu Qing’s face twitched when he noticed the gazes coming from the surroundings, and he stared fixedly at the man, “Speaking without giving it any thought might bring death.”

“You....” The man took around 10 steps back, and he pointed a finger at Yu Qing while horror filled his eyes, “You... you....” He seemed like he’d been terrified by Yu Qing and was actually unable to speak.

Yu Qing was speechless.

Some of the others in the surroundings shook their heads as they felt that the man in green clothes was quite a coward. But it made sense to them because Cloud Merchant Group was powerful, so would anyone not fear a threat coming from them? They gazed once more at Yu Qing’s group when they thought up to this point. Why would Cloud Merchant Group threaten the green clothed man? Could it be that they really are behind this?

The spectators’ gazes became quite strange when they thought up to this point, but none dared to step forward.

Yu Qing was livid when he noticed their gazes. He was just about to speak when a clear and melodious voice resounded from behind him, “Young Brother, you must be joking. How could my Cloud Merchant Group possibly spoil its reputation for just a few violet crystals? It was caused by a small problem in the formations on the shuttle. There’s no need to let your thoughts run wild. I’ll be resolved in a moment.” Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

All of them looked towards the source of the voice and saw a beautiful woman walking over slowly.

She was dressed like a noble with her hair pinned into a bun above her head. She possessed beautiful brows, apricot shaped eyes, and jade white skin. She was absolutely gorgeous, and her figure was extremely hot and curvaceous.

Yu Qing’s expression changed upon seeing her, and he hurriedly walked over to her and bowed, “Eldest Young Miss, just leave such trivial matters to me. How could I possibly trouble you for this?”

The expressions of everyone here changed upon witnessing this scene. After all, Yu Qing was a Saint! But a Saint had actually acted so respectfully to her. So, it made them wonder what her identity was!

“It’s fine!” She walked slowly towards the man in green clothes, “It started in your room. I presume that there’s something wrong with the formation in your room. May we enter your room to inspect it?”

The man suddenly pointed at Yu Qing and said, “He threatened me just now....”

The corners of Yu Qing’s mouth twitched. He wanted to say something but seem to be worried about something, so he could only stare fixedly at Yang Ye and remain silent.

“Manager Yu shouldn’t have spoken inappropriately.” She flicked 5 violet crystals to Yang Ye when she spoke up to this point, “Take it as your compensation and let the matter rest, alright?”

The man quickly took the violet crystals and chuckled, “Big Sister, you’re truly too kind. It was just a trivial matter. Do I look like someone who would constantly bring up the matter?”

The others here were speechless while the corners of Yu Qing’s mouth almost started spasming.

The woman glanced at the man in green clothes and nodded slightly. She was just about to enter the room when she suddenly stopped again, and then she glanced at the others in the surroundings, “Everyone, I’m sure you’re awake of Cloud Merchant Group’s reputation. Not to mention a few hundred violet crystals, even a few tens of thousands are absolutely incapable of making my Cloud Merchant Group go back on its world. This was only a misunderstanding. We’ll restart the formations in a while, so please go on with your own business!”

They nodded, and it didn’t take long for them to return to their rooms.

The beautiful woman turned around to glance at the green clothed man, and then she walked into the room. She’d only just walked into the room when An Nanjing walked over to her. An Nanjing just glanced at the beautiful woman before walking to the green clothed man’s side.

The green clothed man was Yang Ye of course.

The slightest mistake might expose Snowy’s existence, and if that happened, then it might become troublesome to deal with. So, Yang Ye had no choice but to act like this.

The beautiful woman sized up An Nanjing, and then she glanced at the surroundings. In the end, she gazed at Yu Qing, but Yu Qing shook his head slightly.

The beautiful woman’s gaze descended onto Yang Ye and An Nanjing again, and a short while passed before she said, “There really is a slight problem with the formation that caused the spirit energy here to leak out. We’ll converge energy here again. Please enjoy your trip!” She turned around and left once she finished speaking.

Yu Qing took a deep long glance at Yang Ye and An Nanjing, and then he quickly followed the woman.

...

Room 1.

Yu Qing spoke solemnly, “Eldest Young Miss, there’s definitely something off about them!”

She pondered deeply for a short while before she said, “The spirit energy in every single room can last for around 3 years. They were both Half-Saints, so it was utterly impossible for them to absorb so much spirit energy. With the formations there to act as a barrier, even Saints would find it impossible to absorb the spirit energy throughout the shuttle with such ease. So, there’s only one explanation. They definitely possess some sort of strange or divine treasure!”

She paused for a moment when she spoke up to this point, and then she continued, “Have you investigated their background?”

Yu Qing said, “They are from Pine Prefecture!”

“Pine Prefecture?” She nodded lightly, “Restart the formations. As for the 2 of them, just monitor them for now. Even though our merchant group doesn’t care about a few crystals, we can’t let others play us for fools.”

“Understood!” Yu Qing nodded and left.

...

Room 20.

The beautiful woman had just left when Yang Ye immediately started laughing bitterly. After all, they’d almost landed themselves in trouble. He stretched out his hand, and there were 10 violet crystals there. Snowy had just spat all of them out. Actually, even Yang Ye had the impulse to let Snowy continue. Of course, that was impossible because they would definitely be in huge trouble if Snowy was allowed to do it again.

Meanwhile, Snowy suddenly stuck her head out from between the clothes on Yang Ye’s chest. She glanced at the surroundings and opened her mouth. An Nanjing’s expression changed and hurriedly covered Snowy’s mouth.

Snowy blinked, and her eyes were filled with bewilderment.

An Nanjing removed her hand and rubbed Snowy’s head while a gentle gaze filled her eyes.

Yang Ye took Snowy in his hands and said, “From now onwards, you’re not allowed to absorb spirit energy without my permission. Understand?”

Snowy nodded, and then she stretched out her claws and wrapped them around Yang Ye’s face before rubbing her head against his cheek just like the violet mink did.

Yang Ye smiled, “You can go back in now!”

Snowy shook her head instead and started waving her claws. A short while passed before Yang Ye figured out what she meant. Zi’er was in closed door cultivation within that pocket of space, so she was bored being all by herself in there. So, she didn’t want to head back in.

Yang Ye was put in quite a difficult position. Because if he kept the little fellow outside, then it might cause trouble for him. Meanwhile, An Nanjing suddenly said, “Let her stay outside.”

Yang Ye gazed at An Nanjing, “That little fellow isn’t ordinary. She’s a Sprite King. We’ll be in quite a bit of trouble if others find out about her existence!”

An Nanjing spoke softly, “We can’t wrong her just because we’re afraid of some trouble, right?”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and nodded, “Right. She was kept in confinement for so long, so I shouldn’t have done the same.” He rubbed Snowy’s head at this point and said, “You can stay outside, but you can’t absorb spirit energy without my permission. Understand?”

Snowy nodded swiftly. In the end, she wrapped her arms around his forehead and kissed him on the forehead, and then she flew over to An Nanjing’s shoulder and rubbed her forehead against An Nanjing’s cheek.

An Nanjing revealed a slight smile, and then she took Snowy in her arms. Snowy seemed to like An Nanjing quite a bit as well, and she ceaselessly rubbed her head against An Nanjing’s hand.

Yang Ye smiled, “You seem to like her quite a bit!”

An Nanjing nodded.

Yang Ye suddenly asked, “What do you plan to do after this?”

An Nanjing raised her head and glanced at Yang Ye, “I only recognize you.”

Yang Ye felt touched and was about to speak. However....

Bang!

The entire Cloud Shuttle suddenly shook violently!

Yang Ye and An Nanjing’s expressions changed. Meanwhile, Yu Qing’s voice suddenly resounded through the shuttle, “It’s the Evil God Sect. Everyone, be careful!”

Bang!

The door to their room was suddenly opened and Xuwu Shen ran in. He gazed at Yang Ye and An Nanjing while an extremely serious expression covered his face, “The Evil God Sect is a Platinum Rank power. Even though it’s a Platinum Rank power just like my Endless Devil Sect, their strength isn’t something we can compare to at all....”

Yang Ye interrupted Xuwu Shen, “Get to the point!”

Xuwu Shen said, “They are a bunch of bandits and rogues, and they specialize in robbing and plundering.”

Yang Ye asked, “How many Saints did they bring?”

Xuwu Shen spoke solemnly, “20!”

The corners of Yang Ye’s mouth twitched, “Are Saints abundant like dogs in the Central Divine Prefecture? Why are there Stains everywhere?”

Xuwu Shen shook his head, “It isn’t that they have many Saints, it’s because they have a huge population. Do you know how huge the Central Divine Prefecture is? It’s at least the equivalent of 1,000 Pine Prefectures, and its population is at least more than 100 times the population of Pine Prefecture. When it has such a huge population and coupled with the abundant spirit energy and spirit veins there, how could they possibly have only a few Saints?”

Yang Ye nodded, “That is true!”

“AH!!” Suddenly, a terrifying aura swept through the Cloud Shuttle, and then a few shrill cries resounded!

Yang Ye and An Nanjing’s expressions changed!

“An Emperor?” There was shock in Yang Ye’s eyes.
