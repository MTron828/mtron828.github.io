Chapter 2266 – All of You Will Die!

Yang Ye was stunned on the spot, and it was like he’d lost his soul!

At this moment, he finally understood why Yang Wudi hadn’t woken up.

Yang Wudi sought death!

Yang Wudi had chosen to die!

No one could save someone who wanted to die.

Actually, if it wasn’t for Yang Ye, Yang Wudi may have chosen to die a long time ago. The reason he’d lived until now was because he was worried about Yang Ye. But now that he’d seen that Yang Ye had grown up, he had no further desire to live.

When he fell into the hands of the undying race, he knew that maybe Yang Ye would come to save him one day, so he’d left that letter behind.

Actually, he would die even without the undying race!

Yang Ye knelt down slowly while tears suddenly covered his face.

Once upon a time, he hated his father whom he’d never met. As far as he was concerned, his mother would be alive if it wasn’t for his father. So, he had the desire to kill that father whom he’d never met!

But he was wrong, absolutely wrong!

Some love could not be seen with the eye!

The man before him had done too much for him without saying a word, and he loved both Yang Ye and Yang Ye’s mother.

An Nanjing glanced at Yang Wudi, and she felt sincere admiration to the man within the casket.

The man before her could have gone much further and lived much longer, but he didn’t choose any of that. All because the woman he loved was dead! His love was moving!

How many in the world could do that?

Yang Wudi’s strength was inferior to the Unfettered One, but he was the only person the Unfettered One admired. That was why he hadn’t killed Yang Wudi, even when he could. Moreover, he’d even used his sword energy to protect Yang Wudi’s corpse.

He was a true man!

A long time passed before Yang Ye stood up slowly, and then he placed Yang Wudi’s corpse within the Primordial Pagoda.

An Nanjing spoke softly, “Don’t be sad!”

Yang Ye shook his head slightly, “I’m not sad because his choice is a form of release and happiness to him!”

Yang Ye suddenly took An Nanjing’s hand and said, “If it wasn’t for all of you, my life would be meaningless too!”

She tightened her grip on his hand and didn’t say a word.

“Let’s go!” Yang Ye was about to leave with An Nanjing when the latter suddenly said, “Why don’t you use your violet energy to revive the experts here and use them to annihilate the undying race?”

Yang Ye was about to speak when their expressions changed, and then they vanished on the spot. They were outside the Tomb of Gods when they appeared again, and a towering palm descended upon the tomb and obliterated it!

It was gone!

The entire tomb and all the experts within it had been obliterated!

Yang Ye shot a glance into the sky. Obviously, someone didn’t want them to revive the experts in the tomb. It made sense because if all of them came together, it would really not be difficult for them to annihilate the undying race. Unfortunately, he didn’t have the chance to do that.

It was truly a pity!

Yang Ye shook his head, but it didn’t take long for him to feel that it wasn’t really a huge pity. Those people had been sealed there for countless years, so even if they were revived, their strength would definitely not be what it used to be. Moreover, it was difficult to know how they would react. Perhaps he would be the first they killed after they were revived. After all, he had a precious treasure like the Primordial Pagoda, and it was perfect for recovering from injuries.

Meanwhile, An Nanjing suddenly asked, “Where do we go now?”

Where do we go now?

Yang Ye looked up at the sky. Tian Xiu and Feng Yihan were still fighting in that distant battlefield of theirs.

Help?

Yang Ye couldn’t help at all in a battle of that level. Not to mention in his current state, he couldn’t interfere even when he was at his prime. Unless he could ignite his intents again, then he may be able to be of slight help. But now, he could only watch!

An Nanjing suddenly said, “We have to leave!”

“Leave?” Yang Ye shook his head slightly, “It’s not that easy! And we can’t!”

Presently, the teleportation formation had been closed, so the only way to get through was to reactivate it. But Yang Ye didn’t have the ability to do so! No one in the large universe could do it because there was no spirit energy left here.

Since they couldn’t use the teleportation formation, then tear through space? Both Yang Ye and An Nanjing didn’t possess the strength for that!

An Nanjing fell silent too.

They had no way forward or back now.

Bang!

Suddenly, a loud explosion resounded in the sky, and then the entire city started to shake.

“How dare you!” A furious shout resounded, and then a strand of black energy flashed down from the sky. Meanwhile, a black whip shot up into the sky and slammed against it.

Bang!

The whip shot back where it came from and the black energy was obliterated!

Yang Ye and An Nanjing exchanged glances, and then Yang Ye spoke solemnly, “We must leave the undying race’s territory!”

They vanished on the spot once he finished speaking, but right when they were about to leave, the portal to the large universe vanished.

Yang Ye frowned. He looked behind him, and explosions were resounding incessantly far within the city.

A battle!

There was a battle over there!

An Nanjing spoke solemnly, “I don’t think they closed it because of us. It should be because of that phantom from before!”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Why?”

An Nanjing said, “If it was just us, they wouldn’t have to do that. Their strength is still sufficient to annihilate us. Their true target is that phantom. However, who is that phantom and why did that phantom attack both the undying race and us?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “He was puzzled about that too.

The phantom hadn’t just attacked the undying race, it had attacked them too. In other words, it wanted to annihilate the undying race and them!

Who was it?

Yang Ye couldn’t figure it out!

Yang Ye spoke solemnly, “Come, let’s go over and have a look!”

An Nanjing gazed at Yang Ye, and he spoke softly, “Let’s see who that is. In any case, we can’t leave now.”

An Nanjing thought for a moment and nodded.

They vanished on the spot, and it didn’t take them long to arrive at the Undead Tower.

At this moment, the five Undead Warriors stood there with their sabers in hand, and the undead cavalry stood behind them. However, only less than 200 of the undying cavalry remained now, and there were almost 60 corpses before the tower.

Besides that, Yang Ye noticed that there was a formation below them. It was formed from countless strands of black energy, death energy. The formation was ceaselessly producing death energy that converged into the five Undead Warriors, allowing their injuries and aura to improve tremendously.

However, they weren’t at their peak.

Yang Ye thought for a moment as he watched from afar. He had no doubt of the phantom’s strength, but if the Undead Warriors were at their peak, it would be very, very difficult to kill them!

Not to mention the Undead Warriors, if he was still in the state where his intents had been ignited, he wouldn’t fear the phantom either. Yet now, perhaps Void Spirit Maiden and the patriarch of the undying race were the only existences in the large universe who could suppress the phantom!

The phantom’s figure was faintly visible and kept flickering, and the phantom had a whip in its grasp.

Swish! Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Suddenly, the sound of air being torn open resounded, and then a whip tore through space and shot at the Undead Warriors.

“Slash!” A voice resounded, and then all five of them swung their sabers.

Hiss!

Their saber energy merged into one and shot forward.

Bang!

A loud explosion resounded, and the saber energy exploded apart. But the whip didn’t vanish, and it shot toward the Undead Warriors.

“Break!” Suddenly, Dugu Juetian’s voice resounded, and then numerous spears suddenly tore through the air and shot at both the whip and the phantom.

The spears were like a storm, and it was extremely terrifying!

The phantom raised its right hand slightly and swept it horizontally. In an instant, the whip rose like a dragon and formed countless whip images in the air.

It was like a dance of dragons in the sky!

The spears were obliterated before the whip images, and then a huge whip image slammed down from above.

Its target was the undying cavalry, but the Undead Warriors suddenly appeared in the air. They shook in a row, and then they simultaneously drew their sabers and slashed. Meanwhile, countless strands of death energy converged to them from beneath their feet!

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!

The saber energy tore through the air and shot at the whip in succession.

Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!

Rumbling explosions resounded incessantly!

A few breaths of time later, the phantom vanished on the spot, and then the five strands of saber energy exploded apart before a whip swept at the Undead Warriors!

Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!

In an instant, all five of them were blasted away.

The whip descended!

bang!

The huge formation on the ground exploded apart and transformed into dust.

Dugu Juetian stared at the phantom, “Who are you?!”

The phantom flipped its right palm, and the whip returned to the phantom. The phantom gazed at Dugu Juetian and the others, and then an icy cold voice resounded, “You’re not welcome over there. All of you will die!”
