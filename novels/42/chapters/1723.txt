Chapter 1724 - Where’s Yang Ye?

Sword Immortal City!

At this moment, it was the center of attention throughout the medium universe.

Countless people rushed to Sword Immortal City. Some were there to kill Yang Ye, and some were there to watch the show. In short, it was much busier than any other time in the past.

Noon.

A young man in a green robe appeared outside the city. He had a sword in his grasp. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

It was Yang Ye, of course.

Didn’t they want to kill him?

Fine. They didn’t have to look for him or go to Merak System. He’d shown himself and made them come for him!

He’d traveled to the Lu Clan with the hopes that the Lu Clan would stop playing tricks in secret and stop selling information about his whereabouts. He wasn’t afraid that others would come from him, he just didn’t want to kill all day and waste time!

However, he noticed that avoiding it didn’t help!

Since he couldn’t avoid it, then he intended to face it head-on!

Right when Yang Ye was about to enter the city, a violet robed old man suddenly appeared at the entrance and obstructed Yang Ye’s path.

The old man looked quite old. His hair was completely white, and he had a violet sword hanging on his waist.

Yang Ye glanced at the old man, and it didn’t take long for him to frown. Because he was actually unable to sense the old man’s aura.

The old man suddenly spoke, “You’re Yang Ye, right?”

Yang Ye nodded, “Yes!”

The old man said, “My master requests your presence!”

Yang Ye frowned, “Your master?”

The old man nodded, and then he started walking further into the city.

Yang Ye fell silent for a moment, and then he followed the old man.

It didn’t take long for Yang Ye to arrive at an extremely familiar place — The Grand Immortal Pavilion!

The old man didn’t say anything. He just led Yang Ye up the pavilion. When they arrived before the third floor, the old man hadn’t even arrived before the barrier of light when it automatically split apart!

True Rank sword intent? Yang Ye frowned slightly. His sword intent is at the True Rank? Wait, I’ve encountered True Rank sword intent in the past. His sword intent is absolutely not at the True Rank. If it isn’t at the True Rank, is it above the True Rank?

Yang Ye restrained the thoughts in his mind and walked over to the barrier of light which had appeared again.

He didn’t release his sword intent, and he just stabbed his sword forward. As soon as his sword touched it, the barrier of light was instantly obliterated.

Yang Ye arrived on the third floor, and the old man was looking at him when he walked in.

Yang Ye asked, “What?”

The old man shook his head slightly, and then he turned around and continued forward. It didn’t take long for them to arrive before another barrier of light.

Yang Ye gazed at the old man, “The fourth floor?”

The old man nodded, “The Grand Immortal Pavilion has four floors. However, only a single person can enter the fourth floor.”

Yang Ye asked, “Your master?”

The old man nodded again.

Yang Ye glanced at the barrier of light before him and was about to head over. The old man suddenly stopped him and said, “Stay here and talk with my master!”

Yang Ye glanced at the old man, “You want me to talk to that master of yours from here?”

The old man replied, “Exactly. Only my master can enter the fourth floor!”

Yang Ye sized up the old man and said, “I was very curious about who your master is because that person was actually able to make you acknowledge him or her as your master. I was also curious about why your master wanted to see me. Yet now, I’m not curious anymore. Forgive me for being unwilling to stay any longer.”

Yang Ye turned around and walked away.

Yang Ye was quite annoyed right now. They were acting like he was begging to meet the person on the fourth floor. Since they wanted to put on an air of superiority, he felt that they could do it themselves. He refused to go on with this for a moment longer.

Suddenly, the old man obstructed Yang Ye’s path, “You can’t leave!”

Yang Ye looked the old man in the eyes, “Believe me, I’ll destroy this pavilion of yours!”

The old man frowned slightly. He was about to speak when a voice suddenly came from behind the barrier of light, “Uncle Ku, let him up here!”

It was a woman’s voice!

The old man glanced at Yang Ye and gestured for Yang Ye to go ahead.

Yang Ye glanced in the direction of the barrier and said, “Sorry, I don’t want to go up there anymore.”

He turned around and walked away once he finished speaking.

Suddenly, the woman’s voice resounded again, “You’re from Merak System, and I’m from Merak System too.”

Merak System! Yang Ye stopped moving, fell silent for a moment, and then he turned around and gazed at the barrier, “Who are you?”

She replied, “You like talking through a barrier?”

A moment of silence ensued, and then Yang Ye walked over to the barrier. He swung his sword, but it wasn’t able to shatter the barrier. Moreover, he was pushed 30m back instead.

The woman’s voice resounded, “I’m quite disappointed!”

Suddenly, Yang Ye’s hand moved.

Split Second!

At the moment his hand moved, the barrier of light exploded apart.

Yang Ye didn’t say a word, and he just walked into the fourth floor.

The old man didn’t follow him.

After he entered the fourth floor, Yang Ye noticed that it was a bedroom, a woman’s bedroom.

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings. There was a screen not too far away from him, and he could see a figure behind it. Based on its shape, it belonged to a woman, but he couldn’t see her appearance.

Yang Ye didn’t use his divine sense to investigate. Since she didn’t want to let him see her face, then it was pointless to do so by force.

Yang Ye sat down on a chair and asked, “You’re from Merak System?”

She replied, “Do I have a reason to lie to you?”

Yang Ye fell silent for a few moments before he replied, “You know me?”

“I don’t!” She continued, “However, I sense something familiar from you. If I’m not wrong, we definitely have mutual acquaintances.”

Yang Ye said, “Tell me who you know.”

“Some people that I don’t want to mention!” She continued, “I didn’t invite you here for that.”

Yang Ye asked, “Then for what?”

She replied, “Yang Ye, I know a little about the enmity between you and the Yang Clan. However, Sword Immortal City doesn’t want to get mixed up in it. However, you’ve come here… So, I invited you here to ask you to leave the city. Don’t bring the flames of war to Sword Immortal City.”

So that’s why! Yang Ye fell silent for a long time before he said, “I’m sorry for not giving consideration to all aspects.”

She said, “Looks like you’re quite agreeable.”

Yang Ye said, “How about I do it outside the city and not inside. Alright?”

She remained silent.

Yang Ye added, “I’m sure you’re aware that I’ve told the world that I’m here. If I say I’m not here anymore, then others would think that I’m afraid of them.”

She remained silent for a long time, and then she said, “Alright!”

Yang Ye nodded, “Thank you.” He paused for a moment and continued, “Beautiful, I have an unreasonable request.”

She replied, “Then don’t tell me about it!”

Yang Ye’s face froze. But it didn’t take long for him to recover his composure, “Miss, we’re both from Merak System. It’s a rare occurrence for us to meet here so far away from our homes. It’s fate that brought us together. I’m sure you’ve noticed that many are trying to kill me. As someone from Merak System as well, shouldn’t you help a little?”

“Help?” She said, “Help you fight the world, or help you fight the Yang Clan?”

Yang Ye replied, “More or less. Don’t worry, I’ll never forget your kindness.”

She suddenly said, “You skin is absolutely thick!”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

Meanwhile, the woman said, “Yang Ye, with the strength you possess, you’re actually completely capable of fleeing. So long as you flee, even the entire Yang Clan’s forces wouldn’t be able to kill you. I’m really puzzled. Why don’t you flee? Why are you trying to draw their attention instead?”

Yang Ye chuckled, “Because there are people I have to protect. So, I can’t flee.”

She asked, “Those women of yours in Merak System?”

Yang Ye nodded.

She asked, “Can I say a few words?”

Yang Ye said, “Go ahead!”

She said, “Yang Ye, your natural talent in the Sword Dao is quite good. Unfortunately, you can’t sever your emotions and love. If you can abandon it all, then your sword will become even purer and stronger.”

Yang Ye asked, “Like the Unfettered One?”

She asked, “You know him?”

Yang Ye replied with a question, “You do too?”

She fell silent for a moment and replied, “He’s a legend from our Merak System, so how could I not? Even if you’ve never witnessed his strength in person, you should have heard of it. If you’re able to sever your emotions, then it shouldn’t be too difficult for you to attain a similar level as him.

Yang Ye stood up and said, “Miss, the Unfettered One is the Unfettered One, and I am who I am. Why should I try to be him? I don’t need to be anyone, and I just have to be myself.”

Yang Ye turned around and walked away once he finished speaking.

Meanwhile, she suddenly said, “You know… if you don’t sever your emotions, your sword will never be free. It’ll never be able to become as pure as the Unfettered One.”

“If I don’t have the people I love by my side, then even if I’m matchless throughout the universe, it’s still useless to me; but if I have those I love by my side, then I’m even willing to live an ordinary and peaceful life as an ordinary person!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he didn’t even turn around before vanishing…

A long moment of silence ensued before the woman suddenly spoke softly, “A pure heart and one who cherishes his relationships… Rare indeed… Unfortunately, if you don’t sever it, your attainments in the Sword Dao will be limited…”

Once she finished speaking, she fell silent for a long time before she said, “A familiar aura…”

…

After he left the Grand Immortal pavilion, Yang Ye left the city. As soon as he did, a furious howl resounded through the sky, “Where’s Yang Ye? I want your head!”

As soon as the voice finished resounding, a figure shot through the sky.

It didn’t take long for a man to arrive before Yang Ye. He instantly appeared right in front of Yang Ye, and then a saber was pressed against Yang Ye’s throat, “Where’s Yang Ye?”
