Chapter 260 – Break! Break! Break!

Right when the wave of energy was about to hit the spectators, Li Si appeared here once more, and he waved his right hand lightly as he gazed at the terrifying wave of energy that was sweeping over, causing the waves of energy to instantly and mysteriously vanish on the spot. After that, he shot a glance at Yang Ye and Yuan Tong before his figure flashed and vanished on the spot. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

After the wave of energy vanished, all the spectators recovered from their shock, and then they hurriedly gazed at Yang Ye and Yuan Tong!

At this moment, both Yang Ye and Yuan Tong were in a slightly embarrassing state. The terrifying wave of energy had caused their clothes to be in rags. Especially Yuan Tong because countless dense marks of the sword had appeared on the clothes he wore. Even though it was like that, Yuan Tong hadn’t suffered any material harm!

Yang Ye hadn’t suffered any material harm as well. Of course, it was because his physical defenses were formidable.

As he gazed at the dense marks of the sword that covered his clothes, Yuan Tong’s expression became unsightly. He raised his head to gaze at Yang Ye before he said, “Since I advanced into the First Heaven Realm, it’s the first time a profounder at the same realm of cultivation has put me in such an embarrassing state. Needless to say, you’ve succeeded in infuriating me. You’ll pay for this with your life!”

Yang Ye’s brows raised as he said, “Why don’t you give it a try?”

Yuan Tong’s eyes narrowed slightly when he heard this, and then killing intent flashed within them. After that, he took a step forward, and the ground that he stepped on instantly split apart while he raised his hands. Suddenly, a violent gale appeared out of thin air. At the same time, his body suddenly seemed like a vortex, and it made the energy in the surrounding world to start surging towards him without end!

“He’s drawing upon the energy of the heavens and the earth! It’s a Heaven Rank technique! My god! Yuan Tong actually intends to execute a Heaven Rank technique!” Someone amongst the spectators in the surroundings had cried out involuntarily upon witnessing this scene.

On the wall of the Imperial Palace, the frown on Qing Yun’zi’s face had eased up, and it wasn’t covered in worry anymore. He smiled as he said in a low voice, “This Yang Ye really is pretty strong to be able to force Yuan Tong to execute a Heaven Rank technique of my Origin School!”

On the other hand, Cai Feng smiled without trying to cover it up at all. A Heaven Rank technique. That isn’t something an Earth Rank technique can compare to. Yang Ye is definitely dead this time!

Yu Heng and Su Qingshi frowned simultaneously instead. They were naturally aware of the might possessed by a Heaven Rank technique, and it was countless times stronger than an Earth Rank technique. So, how could Yang Ye resist a Heaven Rank technique?

The energy around Yuan Tong grew denser and denser. In the end, it actually seemed material. Yuan Tong roared with laughter, and then he gazed at Yang Ye who stood in front of him and said, “Yang Ye, receive a move of mine as well!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yuan Tong took another step forward, and then he raised his right hand and pointed a finger towards Yang Ye. “Calamity Point!”

As soon as he spoke, the clouds in the sky above the square had suddenly started roiling, and then a few bolts of lightning suddenly appeared amidst the clouds. Subsequently, an extremely enormous finger gradually appeared from within the clouds, and the others in the surroundings couldn’t help but tremble at the instant that this enormous finger appeared.

As he gazed at the enormous finger, Yang Ye’s expression had turned extraordinarily solemn. He was able to sense the terrifying energy contained within the enormous finger. Even if his physical body had been cultivated to an inconceivable state, he would probably be transformed into mush if he was struck by this enormous finger!

As she gazed at the enormous finger appearing from the clouds, Su Qingshi’s beautiful brows had knit together, and her fair finger trembled slightly while the profound energy within her body had started to circulate swiftly.

Qing Yun’zi seemed to have sensed the unusual movement of profound energy within Su Qingshi, and he glanced at her before the profound energy within his body started circulating as well. Even though Yang Ye wasn’t a match for Yuan Tong, if he were to fall into the Sword Sect’s hands, then the Sword Sect would definitely be able to rise to prominence in the future. So, he felt that it was best for Yang Ye to die!

“Should we rescue him?” Bai Qi gazed at Yang Ye as he spoke in a low voice.

A wisp of hesitation flashed in Li Si’s eyes, but he shook his head in the end, and he said, “4th level Sword Intent while below the age of 20. He can really be considered as a genius in the Sword Dao. However, it’s insufficient to make us break the rules for him. As I said before, our Grand Qin Empire will definitely save him if he’s able to obtain the 1st position on the Ascension Rankings!”

Bai Qi shook his head lightly and said, “This Heaven Rank technique isn’t something he can resist. Unless he possesses a Heaven Rank technique as well. However, he still hasn’t executed one until now. Obviously, he doesn’t!”

Li Si didn’t say anything else.

On the battlefield, the extremely enormous finger carried terrifying might and emanated immense pressure as it descended straight down towards Yang Ye. Because the energy contained within it was truly too terrifying, the ground around Yang Ye had actually started to collapse inch by inch when it was over 100m away from the ground....

On the other hand, as the target of the enormous finger, Yang Ye had actually slowly closed his eyes at this moment.

The countless spectators in the surroundings were stunned when they witnessed this scene. Does Yang Ye intend to surrender? Even if he wants to surrender, he should shout that he admits defeat and not act in this way. Could it be that he wants to throw his life away?

Under the puzzled and bewildered gazes of countless others in the surroundings, the enormous finger arrived less than 3m above Yang Ye. Right at this moment, Yang Ye’s eyes suddenly opened, and two sword lights flashed in the depths of them. At the same time, Yang Ye drew his sword and stabbed it directly at the enormous finger, causing a golden strand of sword qi to shoot out explosively!

“Break!” Along with this loud shout from Yang Ye, the golden strand of sword qi had instantly shot at the center of the enormous finger, and then it shook slightly under the astounded gazes of everyone. After that, a bang resounded as the enormous finger exploded apart!

Everyone was dumbstruck!

A Heaven Rank technique was destroyed just like that? That’s a Heaven Rank technique! A Heaven Rank technique! But it vanished with a casual wave of Yang Ye’s hand? At this moment, the minds of countless people had gone blank.

On the walls of the Imperial Palace, all the great figures there had frowned. Obviously, even they couldn’t figure out how Yang Ye had destroyed the Heaven Rank technique with a single strike of his sword!

At this moment, Li Si and Bai Qi had frowned as well. Because destroying a Heaven Rank technique with a single strike of the sword was really too unusual.

How did Yang Ye accomplish this? Countless people were thinking about this very question right now.

At this moment, Yuan Tong had frowned as well, and his eyes were filled with a puzzled and bewildered expression. He was naturally clearly aware of the might possessed by a Heaven Rank technique. It was exactly because he was clearly aware of it that he was even more puzzled and bewildered. Because even a peak King Realm expert was very likely to be instantly annihilated by a Heaven Rank technique. However, such a technique had been destroyed by a single strike of Yang Ye’s sword....

Yuan Tong let out a light breath of air, flipped his palm, and then swiftly pushed it toward Yang Ye. “Heavensplit Palm!”

As soon as he finished speaking, an enormous energy palm whistled through the air and left behind a string of explosions as it shot violently towards Yang Ye.

There was no emotion on Yang Ye’s face as he gazed at the Earth Rank technique, Heavensplit Palm, that was shooting towards him, and he suddenly drew his sword and slashed when it was merely 3m away from him. “Break!”

The strange scene from before had appeared once more. Under the astounded and puzzled gazes of everyone in the surroundings, the enormous and terrifying energy palm had suddenly exploded with a bang, and then it dispersed and vanished in midair.

“What exactly is going on? Is Yang Ye cheating? Why can a simple strike of his sword destroy Earth Rank and Heaven Rank techniques? There’s definitely something fishy about this!”

“Exactly. Doesn’t Yang Ye possess a mysterious King Rank Darkbeast? Could it be that it’s lending him a hand?”

“It’s definitely like that. Otherwise, how could Yang Ye be so formidable to destroy a Heaven Rank technique with a single strike of his sword? Does he think he’s the Sword Emperor?”

Countless people started discussing animatedly in the surroundings.

On the other hand, the brows of the great figures on the walls of the Imperial Palace had knit together even more tightly, and then puzzled expressions in their eyes had grown denser. Because this scene was truly too mysterious. Their instinct told them that the mysterious King Rank Darkbeast in Yang Ye’s position hadn’t lent Yang Ye a hand because if it had, then they would have definitely been able to sense it with the strengths they possessed!

It was exactly because of this that they felt even more puzzled and bewildered.

Li Si was staring fixedly at Yang Ye as if he wanted to see through Yang Ye. Earlier, he’d been constantly recollecting the scene from before when Yang Ye had swung his sword because Li Si wanted to determine if Yang Ye had relied on any external sources of strength. However, the facts told him that Yang Ye hadn’t relied on any external sources of strength.

It was exactly because of this that Li Si’s mind was filled with bewilderment. How exactly did Yang Ye destroy an Earth Rank and Heaven Rank technique with a single strike of his sword?It wasn’t just Li Si, many others were trying to guess the answer as well, and they’d thought of countless possibilities. However, none of them had thought of the Enlightened Sword Heart. Because in the 10,000 years of history of the southern territory, the number of people who’d attained the Enlightened Sword Heart could be counted with a single hand. Every one of these people was the Sword Emperor of their time. They were extraordinary experts that reigned supreme over a generation. So, how could Yang Ye be compared to such figures?

So, no one in the surroundings had thought that Yang Ye possessed the Enlightened Sword Heart!

At this moment, Yuan Tong’s expression was slightly unsightly. Yang Ye had destroyed a Heaven Rank and Earth Rank technique he executed with a single strike of the sword, and this was undoubtedly like a slap to his face! Even though he really wondered how exactly Yang Ye had accomplished this, he felt even more rage at this moment.

Yuan Tong took another step forward while the small amount of profound energy that was left within his body had started to surge violently. He gazed at Yang Ye and said with a slightly savage tone, “Yang Ye, I don’t believe you’re so mysterious. Receive a few more moves of mine and let me see if you really can destroy all of them with a single strike of your sword!” As soon as he finished speaking, Yuan Tong lightly tapped his right foot on the ground and instantly soared up into the sky!

In midair, Yuan Tong moved about swiftly, and then numerous terrifying combat techniques covered the heavens and the earth as they enveloped down towards Yang Ye.

“Heavensplit Palm!”

“Break!”

“Earthshatter!”

“Break!”

“The Enlightened King’s Seal!”

“Break!”

“....”

On the battlefield, every single combat technique that Yuan Tong executed was destroyed by a single strike of Yang Ye’s sword.

As they watched such a scene, all the spectators in the surroundings seemed to have been petrified on the spot, and their eyes were filled with shock and bewilderment.

Qing Yun’zi’s brows were knit together tightly. Suddenly, he seemed to have thought of something, and his eyes opened wide. At the same time, he suddenly clenched his fists tightly while his eyes were filled with astonishment, and he said with a slightly trembling voice, “Enlightened... Enlightened Sword... Enlightened Sword Heart....”

At this moment, it wasn’t just Qing Yun’zi who’d thought of this. The members of all the other five great powers and both Li Si and Bai Qi from the Grand Qin Empire had thought of it as well.
