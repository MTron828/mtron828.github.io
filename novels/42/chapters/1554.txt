Chapter 1555 - To The Divine Phoenix Clan!

Translator: InVader

In the Primordial Pagoda.

Yang Ye sat cross-legged in the room on the 3rd level. After he consumed the Ginseng Fruit, countless strands of pure energy instantly erupted within him. At the same time, the pure venom Yang Ye had absorbed from Ku Moye was surging out from the Primordial Pagoda again.

Two types of pure energy were madly surging through Yang Ye’s body and stimulating Yang Ye’s body, and Yang Ye’s body had started to absorb them.

As more and more energy was absorbed, the aura Yang Ye emanated grew progressively stronger.

The Semi-Deity Realm!

The Semi-Deity Realm represented that one was halfway into the Deity Realm. So, the barrier between these two realms wasn’t very strong. Of course, it wasn’t weak either.

Even though Yang Ye had advanced a little quickly, his foundation was very strong and stable, and that was why he dared to charge into the Deity Realm.

Actually, Yang Ye’s speed of advancement wasn’t very quick when compared to those in the same age group as him. For example, some of the cultivators of the large world were already Deities at his age. Even though there weren’t many of them at the Deity Realm, there weren’t few as well.

The Primordial Pagoda seemed clearly aware that Yang Ye intended to charge into the Deity Realm, so it was ceaselessly sending energy to him.

Just like that, time passed slowly.

A month later.

At this moment, Yang Ye’s aura hadn’t just stopped growing stronger, it was gradually vanishing. Yang Ye who sat cross-legged there seemed like he’d transformed into stone, and he wasn’t moving at all.

In the 2nd level, Little Sky who was treating Xiao Qi suddenly glanced upwards, and then she shook her head, “That fellow is cheating again.”

As far as she was concerned, advancing here was equivalent to cheating. However, she didn’t want Yang Ye to go outside as well. Because if Yang Ye advanced in the outside world, he would definitely get into battle with the Eye of the Heaven Dao. She didn’t want to see that happen.

Little Sky didn’t pay any further attention to Yang Ye and just looked down at Xiao Qi, and then she spoke softly, “What a strange body structure. It’s like the structure of a human, but it isn’t really alike. This fellow is probably not human. No, she may be an evolved human. Tsk, tsk. Let me continue my research…”

…

Another 15 days later, Yang Ye suddenly opened his eyes, and then he stood up slowly.

Xiao Yuxi walked over quickly and said, “Did you succeed?”

Her voice was filled with anxiety. This time, she really didn’t know if Yang Ye had succeeded. Because Yang Ye had been too calm for the last 15 days, and there hadn’t been even the slightest fluctuation of energy throughout his body.

Yang Ye slowly stretched his hand towards her. In the beginning, she was puzzled by this, but it didn’t take long for her eyes to slowly open wide. Because she noticed that she couldn’t move at all. No, it should be said that she’d become slow, extremely slow. It was like she’d been slowed down ten times!

The Laws of Time!

The sign of a Deity!

Yang Ye withdrew his hand and said, “Actually, I was comprehending the energy of time in the last 15 days.”

Just as he’d said, he’d been comprehending the Laws of Time for the last 15 days. Time was something ethereal as well, and it was an abstract concept. It could only be proved to exist through other things. So, needless to say, it was extremely difficult to comprehend.

Fortunately, Yang Ye was a Semi-Deity, and he’d witnessed the effects of the Laws of Time in the past. So, while it was quite difficult, he wasn’t completely lost.

After comprehending it for 15 days, Yang Ye finally understood what the Laws of Time were, and he’d pierced the barrier between the Semi-Deity Realm and Deity Realm, allowing him to advance smoothly into the Deity Realm!

The Deity Realm!

After he attained the Deity Realm, his strength wasn’t the only thing which had increased tremendously, his lifespan had been increased as well. Presently, the issues created from utilizing the Stellar Sword Diagram that day had been completely resolved. Semi-Deities had 20,000 years to live, and Deities had around 30,000 years. However, he only had around 10,000 years now. In other words, advancing from the Semi-Deity Realm to the Deity Realm provided 10,000 years of lifespan.

Of course, other Deities definitely had more than 10,000 years of lifespan, but he was different. He’d spent almost all of it, so he only had 10,000 left!

Was a lifespan of 10,000 years a very long time? It was long to many cultivators, but as far as Yang Ye was concerned, it was only two rounds of the Stellar Sword Diagram.

Actually, he had a strong suspicion that the old man in a Daoist’s robe wasn’t the true cause of Jian Wuji’s death, and it was the Stellar Sword Diagram that had exhausted Jian Wuji’s lifespan.

Even if he was a Deity now, he was very well aware that he was still unable to endure the energy of the stars. Not to mention him, even a Rebirth Realm expert would be burdened by it!

Unfortunately, Jian Wuji was gone, so he couldn’t get an answer to that question.

Yang Ye stayed with Xiao Yuxi for some time before he went to the 2nd level.

At this moment, Little Sky was still treating Xiao Qi.

Yang Ye asked softly, “How long will it take to wake her up?”

Little Sky replied, “It shouldn’t take too long.”

Yang Ye heaved a sigh of relief and gazed at her, “Thank you.”

She blinked and said, “Remember what I told you in the past about naming that world of yours as Little Sky Continent?”

Yang Ye nodded, “Why?”

She chuckled, “We’ll call that continent Little Sky Continent from now on, alright?”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

Meanwhile, Little Sky suddenly said, “Sigh, I haven’t slept for so long just to try and help your friend, and I never got to have any fun. I’m so tired, so very tired. I…”

“Stop!” Yang Ye hurriedly said, “Fine, fine! It’s Little Sky Continent from now on, alright?”

Little Sky cracked a smile, “Alright, remember your promise. Don’t you dare go back on your word.”

Yang Ye smiled, “I won’t!” Actually, he didn’t really care what the world in the 1st level was called. However, Little Sky seemed to really care about that. Since she liked it, then he just went along with it. In any case, he didn’t lose anything. Moreover, she’d helped him tremendously.

Meanwhile, Little Sky suddenly said, “Right, can I invite Little Little Sky and the others to play with me here?”

“What?” Yang Ye was stunned, and then he hurriedly asked, “You want to bring the Eyes of the Heaven Dao in here to play with you?”

She nodded, “Yeah, they’ll really like this place. Of course, they won’t be here all the time. After all, they have other things to do. They’ll just come here on occasion!”

“Er…”Yang Ye was quite hesitant. It was quite inconceivable to let the Eyes of the Heaven Dao in here to play with her. However, he was very well aware that if he agreed, then Little Sky would definitely be able to get them here. However, could he do that?

Yang Ye thought for a long time, and then he shook his head, “No.”

Little Sky was puzzled, “Why?”

Yang Ye explained, “Little Sky, what do you think would happen if others found out about the world in here?”

Little Sky thought for a moment and replied, “Many experts will definitely come looking for you. Even I’m tempted by this treasure of yours! If it hadn’t acknowledged you, even I would want to make it go with me instead!”

Yang Ye’s eyelids twitched. So she has ill intent too!

Meanwhile, Little Sky chuckled, “I was joking! I don’t like to take the belongings of others.”

Yang Ye nodded and said, “Since you’re aware that many experts would come to fight for it if word of it is exposed, then if Little Little Sky exposes its existence or that Lord of the Heaven Dao finds out through Little Little Sky, then you would be in a terrible situation, and it would be bad for me as well.”

That was what he was worried about. If the Lord of the Heaven Dao found out through the Eyes of the Heaven Dao, then he would be finished.

He didn’t think that he could go against the legendary Lord of the Heaven Dao right now!

Not to mention the Lord of the Heaven Dao, even an Eye of the Heaven Dao like Little Little Sky was more than enough trouble for him.

Little Sky fell silent for a long time, and then she nodded, “You’re right. Others can’t find out about this place, or you may be in huge trouble. Then how about I bring them in here to play with me once you’re extremely strong, alright?”

Yang Ye smiled, “Of course.”

She cracked a smile, “I knew you were a good person!”

Yang Ye shook his head, “I’m not a good person, nor do I want to be a good person. It’s better to be bad. The bad can do as they please and aren’t restrained by anything! Hahaha!”

Little Sky spoke seriously, “I can sense that you’re actually kind. You…”

“Stop! Stop!” Yang Ye hurriedly said, “Stop right there. Let’s not discuss that. I have other things to do, so I’m leaving. You have fun!” As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye left the Primordial Pagoda.

Little Sky kept trying to call him a good person at every turn and make him be a good person. He was quite afraid of it now.

Little Sky clenched her fists while a firm expression filled her eyes, “I’ll definitely teach you how to be a good person because only a good person can take control of…”

As she finished speaking, she suddenly frowned and spoke softly, “Take control of what? Oh my! I’ve forgotten again! Forget it!”

As soon as she finished speaking, she turned around and continued treating Xiao Qi. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

…

Once Yang Ye left the Primordial Pagoda, he received Gu Mo’s message that he should head to Demon God Mountain right away.

When Yang Ye arrived at Demon God Mountain, he saw Gu Mo. Besides Gu Mo, Ku Yuan and Yan Lingxue were here as well.

Yang Ye was puzzled, “What are all of you doing here?”

Ku Yuan smiled, “We’ve been waiting for you!”

Yang Ye asked, “Why?”

Ku Yuan smiled, “It’s time to head to the Divine Phoenix Clan’s Hallowed Grounds.”

The Hallowed Grounds of the Divine Phoenix Clan!

Yang Ye clenched his fists slowly.
