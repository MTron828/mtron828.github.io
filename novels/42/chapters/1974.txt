Chapter 1975 – Burial!

Do you dare to face it?

His voice was calm, but it reverberated like a thunderclap.

The surroundings remained deathly silent.

They’d seen Yang Ye's previous attack, and they knew that he’d instantly killed a Know Dao Realm expert. But they didn’t know where his limits were.

He could kill a Know Dao Realm in an instant, and maybe he could do the same to a See Dao Realm expert?

Countless people gazed at Dire Wolf.

To accept the challenge or to refuse it?

Or it should be whether he dared to say yes!

Dire Wolf suddenly took a step forward, “Why wouldn’t I?”

He naturally had to accept it!

Only the strong were respected in the Dead Dimension. If he retreated now, it would be a show of cowardice and weakness. After all, Yang Ye was just at the 2nd stage of the Enlightened Realm.

But he was at the See Dao Realm!

If he didn’t even dare to face an attack from Yang Ye, he would definitely become a laughingstock of the Dead Dimension, and inner demons would form within him.

After all, a See Dao Realm expert feared to face an attack from a 2nd stage Enlightened Realm expert! He would never be able to overcome it!

He had to accept the challenge!

Dire Wolf’s agreement undoubtedly allowed the members of the Dire Wolves and Devil Cave to sigh with relief.

If Dire Wolf didn’t dare to face Yang Ye’s attack, then it represented that a See Dao Realm expert couldn’t rival the strength of a 2nd stage Enlightened Realm expert.

So, what would happen if this 2nd stage Enlightened Realm expert attained the Dao Realm?

Just thinking about it was horrifying!

After Dire Wolf agreed, he gestured at the others to move 3km away.

A’Man spoke softly by Yang Ye’s side, “Be careful!”

She led the others back onto the city walls once she finished speaking.

Only Yang Ye and Dire Wolf remained here.

Dire Wolf sized up Yang Ye, “I remember you. I didn’t expect your strength to grow to such an extent in such a short amount of time. No wonder the geniuses of the outside world insist on jumping into this abyss when they know how dangerous it is!”

When he met Yang Ye last, Yang Ye wasn’t qualified to be taken seriously by him. But at this moment, the sword cultivator who stood before him was someone he had to treat with care.

Someone on the same level!

He treated Yang Ye as an expert at the same level as him!

Yang Ye didn’t say anything. He just raised his palm, and the sword by his side instantly appeared on his palm.

It was spinning rapidly!

As the sword spun, rays of light seeped out incessantly from it. In the end, Yang Ye’s entire body was covered in rays of light, causing him to seem like an immortal!

Could he kill a See Dao Realm expert?

Yang Ye wasn’t confident that he could. Because it was the first time he was truly fighting such an expert!

But it wouldn’t take long for him to know the answer.

Suddenly, Yang Ye’s sword vanished from his palm, and the surroundings fell silent.

Only a few people here could see what happened after Yang Ye’s sword vanished.

At the moment Yang Ye’s sword vanished, Dire Wolf suddenly stretched out his right hand. In an instant, the space before him froze. It wasn’t just space that froze, the ray of light before him froze as well. Moreover, the sword was slowly moving backwards.

Reversing time!

Time was something that was very difficult to grasp, or to be more precise, it didn’t exist. Time was something people created to record the past, present, and future. But it didn’t actually exist. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

However, the past, present, and future did exist. When one cultivated to a certain level, it wasn’t difficult to make time turn around. Of course, something inconceivable like traveling to the future was something that only the top experts of the world may be able to accomplish. Moreover, it would be extremely dangerous!

The See Dao Realm represented seeing the past.

The Dao contained many things, and one of them was time. The See Dao Realm, was seeing time, and taking control of the elusive concept of the past and gaining the ability to make time flow backwards.

It was an inconceivable ability.

Of course, controlling the future for even a second wasn’t something that a cultivator at Dire Wolf’s level could accomplish.

Presently, only those who had the title Progenitor were capable of truly controlling the past.

As for knowing the future, there were a few in the world who were capable of that, but they were absolutely rare existences.

The ray of light was still moving backwards, and it was growing further and further away from Dire Wolf while growing closer and closer away from Yang Ye.

Dire Wolf gazed at Yang Ye and said, “It’s the gap between us. You can’t use anything to make up for that!”

“Is that so?” A smile curled up on the corners of Yang Ye’s lips, and then a mysterious wave of energy appeared here.

The Sword Domain!

Once the Sword Domain appeared, Yang Ye’s sword suddenly stopped moving, and then Dire Wolf’s expression changed drastically. He swiftly slapped his palms forward.

Bang!

A loud explosion resounded.

Everything returned to normal.

At this moment, Dire Wolf was over 15km away, and he was supporting himself on one knee. Besides that, his arms had vanished, and blood was ceaselessly surging out from both his shoulders.

He’d lost both his arms from a single attack!

He’d lost!

Dire Wolf had lost!

Everyone here was stunned.

A 2nd stage Enlightened Realm cultivator had defeated a See Dao Realm expert!

Dire Wolf suddenly looked up at Yang Ye, “The Sword Domain!”

Yang Ye closed his eyes slowly, and a short while passed before he turned around and walked towards the city.

His sword remained floating by his side.

It moved with him!

Dire Wolf took a deep and long glance at Yang Ye, and then he turned around and left.

The members of the Dire Wolves and Devil Cave followed behind him.

After Dire Wolf’s group left, a wisp of blood seeped out from the corner of Yang Ye’s mouth, and it flowed incessantly.

While he’d taken both of Dire Wolf’s arms with a single attack, he’d paid a terrible price for it. He’d used the Sword Domain to forcefully overcome Dire Wolf’s ability to control time, and he suffered backlash from it. Because Dire Wolf’s strength far surpassed his own!

The backlash he suffered was quite severe!

Both his mind and soul were severely injured!

Based on his estimations, it would take at least 10 days for him to recover!

Meanwhile, A’Man appeared in front of Yang Ye. She took a glance at him and asked, “Are you alright?”

Yang Ye wiped off the blood on the corner of his mouth, and then he shook his head, “It’s nothing serious.”

A’Man nodded slightly. She was about to speak when Yan Lan and Li Li appeared before A’Man.

“Big Sis!”

Yan Lan wanted to say something, but A’Man waved her hand, “Yan Lan, everyone has a right to make their own choices. There’s nothing wrong with taking the path you’ve taken. However, it’s just as I’ve said earlier. Both of you and us aren’t brothers anymore. So, leave Sky Residence City!”

Qin Chuan and the others remained silent.

Actually, Qin Chuan and the others were quite unhappy. After all, how could anyone be happy after they were betrayed? However, they didn’t say anything. It was A’Man’s decision, and they respected her!

Yan Lan and the others had quite complicated expressions on their faces. A long time passed before Yan Lan gazed at everyone here and said, “I’m sorry!”

Qin Chuan and the others remained silent.

Yan Lan’s gaze dimmed down. Both Li Li and him didn’t say another word and just left.

At this moment, everyone’s hearts were filled with complicated emotions.

After all, they once considered each other as brothers!

Once Yan Lan and Li Li left, A’Man gazed at the corpses of the other two, and then she shook her head, “Qin Chuan, give them a proper burial.”

Qin Chuan nodded, and then Yu Jing and him vanished with the corpses.

A’Man gazed at Yang Ye, and Yang Ye said, “I want to rest!”

A’Man nodded slightly.

All of them entered the city. Yang Ye sat down cross-legged and immersed his consciousness into his body. Meanwhile, gazes were frequently shot at him from time to time.

Yu Jing nudged Qin Chuan lightly with his elbow and said, “Qin Chuan, you’re closer to that fellow, so go ask him how he grew so strong in such a short amount of time!”

Qin Chuan laughed bitterly, “I want to know the answer to that too!”

While Yang Ye’s strength had been pretty good before this, he wasn’t strong to such an extent. It could be said that Yang Ye was probably the strongest in Sky Residence City right now.

No one here was confident in being able to defend themselves against that attack!

Yu Jing chuckled slyly, “Ask him later!”

Qin Chuan nodded, “I will once he wakes up!”

In the Primordial Pagoda.

Healing!

Yang Ye’s injuries were healing rapidly with the help of his Primordial Violet Energy.

12 days later, Yang Ye finally recovered completely.

Once he left the Primordial Pagoda, Yang Ye was stunned by the scene he saw upon opening his eyes.

There were many people around him, and the person at the front of the group was Qin Chuan.

At this moment, all of them were staring at him!

Yang Ye asked, “What are you doing?”

Qin Chuan moved closer to Yang Ye, “Tell me the truth. How did you become so strong? Did you take some kind of miraculous pill?”

Yang Ye chuckled, “I don’t have any pills. I just got a little lucky.”

Luck!

Obviously, Yang Ye was speaking about a fortuitous encounter, so Qin Chuan did the sensible thing and refrained from asking further. The others did the same.

Yang Ye chatted with the others for a while, and then he went to A’Man, “Big Sis, I want to leave this place!”

A’Man was slightly shocked, and then she asked, “You plan to go to the other side of Hell Mountain Range?”

Yang Ye nodded, “I want to have a look there!”

A’Man hesitated for a moment and said, “I know you’re very strong, but Hell Mountain Range isn’t a normal place at all.”

Yang Ye replied, “I know. However, I still want to go have a look and get something that belongs to me!”

The 12 swords of slaughter!

The middle aged man had left them to him, so he naturally planned to get them.

A'Man thought for a moment and nodded, “Go on. Be careful!”

Yang Ye nodded and said, “Big Sis, feel free to let me know if Sky Residence City needs help. I’ll rush back as quickly as possible!”

A’Man grinned, “Of course!”

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment, and then he flicked a spatial ring over to A’Man, “It’s a small gift for you!”

Yang Ye vanished into the sky once he finished speaking.

A’Man glanced at the contents of the spatial ring and was stunned on the spot.

60 immortal crystals!

There were 60 immortal crystals in the spatial ring!
