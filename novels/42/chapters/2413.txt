Chapter 2414 – Slaughtering a Dragon!

The gray robed old man was about to attack, but Erya suddenly looked up at him.

Danger!

The old man sensed danger when her gaze locked onto him.

The old man was extremely shocked, and he wondered who she was to make him sense danger!

Erya ignored the old man and looked ahead. At this moment, Snowy had a paw over the man’s eyes while she used the other paw to constantly stab the dagger at the man. Unfortunately, her stabs were too, too weak.𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

The one-armed man was still a Three World Realm expert, so his body wasn’t something that could be damaged by someone without the slightest strength like Snowy.

Snowy’s stabs were like scratching an itch to the man!

In the end, Erya couldn’t watch anymore. She patted Snowy on the shoulder to tell Snowy that she could stop.

Snowy glanced at Erya, blinked, and then gazed at the one-armed man. After that, she passed the dagger to Erya in order to display that Erya could do it herself.

Erya didn’t take the dagger, and she just slapped the tombstone on the one-armed man’s body.

Right when her palm was about to slap against the tombstone, a powerful wave of pressure appeared above her, and it was like a shocking mountain that was slamming down upon her.

Erya had no choice but to stop. She didn’t fear that pressure, but Snowy did!

Erya tapped her right foot down and shot up into the air before slamming a punch upward.

Pure strength!

The pressure instantly exploded into pieces before her punch!

Once she destroyed the pressure, Erya didn’t follow up with another attack and returned to Snowy’s side. Yang Ye had told her to protect Snowy and keep Snowy absolutely safe!

An Nanjing seemed slightly relieved when she witnessed how terrifying Erya’s strength was. She wasn’t worried about herself, she was worried about Snowy! Fortunately, Erya was very strong.

The gray robed old man stared at Erya and didn’t dare to attack. Because Erya’s foot was still on the one-armed man’s chest. So long as he attacked, he was sure that the young girl would stomp apart the man’s chest without any hesitation.

The one-armed man had an extremely ferocious expression on his face.

Aggrievance!

He felt extremely aggrieved!

A dignified prince of the desolate had been beaten up like this right after he arrived at Eternal Border. So, as far as the one-armed man was concerned, it was an extraordinarily terrible humiliation! And he would die if word of it were to spread back to the desolate race!

The people of the desolate race could die, but humiliation was out of the option!

Are all the people of Eternal Border so monstrous?

Erya ignored the old man and glanced up at the sky. She said, “Snowy, Big Sister An and the others may not be able to last much longer.”

Snowy pointed at the sky to indicate that she wanted Erya to go help!

Erya shook her head, “I have to protect you. Big Brother Yang will become very terrifying if anything happens to you.”

Actually, Erya was quite afraid of Yang Ye. Especially when he went mad. She’d seen him when he was mad, and he was someone who dared to fight anyone!

Snowy waved the mirror at Erya to display that she had treasures.

Erya shook her head, “No, I must wait until Big Brother Yang returns!”

Snowy felt quite helpless.

Suddenly, a peerlessly terrifying aura came from the distant sky.

An instant later, a ray of white light flashed through the sky.

Erya frowned slightly and clenched her fists. But she didn’t do anything.

In the sky, the white light slammed down upon An Nanjing. She’d clearly noticed the white light, so she gave up on pursuing the expert she was fighting and stabbed her spear forward.

Meanwhile, a palm pressed against her spear.

Bang!

An explosion resounded, and then An Nanjing and the Martial Qilin were blasted 3km away!

The white light dispersed to reveal a woman in a white dress!

Yi Shuihan!

It was Yu Shuihan, the founding ancestor of the Immortal Estate which Yang Ye had destroyed!

After she repulsed An Nanjing, she didn’t stop. Her figure shot over to the Primal True Dragon, and then she overlapped her palms and slammed them down at it!

Bang!

The Primal True Dragon was slammed down from the sky, and it only took a short while for it to slam against the ground. In an instant, a huge abyss was blasted open there.

A moment later, Yi Shuihan looked at the Primal Vicious Tiger, and then she clawed at it from afar.

Bang!

The space around the tiger instantly exploded apart, and then the tiger was blasted away.

As its figure flew away, blood sprayed from all over its body!

Only Oxxy remained now!

Yu Shuihan ignored Oxxy because Oxxy was already heavily injured and wasn’t worth the waste of time. She gazed at Snowy, and Erya stood before Snowy.

Yu Shuihan’s gaze was icy cold as she shot down at Snowy. Suddenly, she stopped on the spot and looked to the side. The heavily injured figure of Oxxy suddenly shot up into the air, and Oxxy swung the Primordial Axe of Creation at her with both hands.

A wisp of ridicule arose on the corners of her mouth, and she suddenly vanished on the spot when Oxxy was just an inch away from her.

Hiss!

A ray of cold light pierced through Oxxy’s stomach, and then his figure instantly stiffened on the spot while Oxxy’s arms fell from its raised position. Meanwhile, Yi Shuihan didn’t stop and slapped her palm against Oxxy’s back.

Bam!

Oxxy instantly fell to the ground, and his body cracked open inch by inch while blood sprayed!

Yi Shuihan still didn’t stop and slapped her palm at Oxxy from afar.

Bang!

The space around Oxxy instantly exploded apart, and Oxxy’s body was torn open with it. An instant later, the color in Oxxy’s eyes gradually dimmed while the axe fell to the ground.

Snowy was furious when she witnessed this, and she was about to charge over but was stopped by Erya. Erya just stared at Yi Shuihan while the desire to kill filled her eyes.

The desire to kill!

A true desire to kill!

Snowy pointed at Oxxy and cried as she did that. Erya really wanted to help, but the gray robed old man was still nearby.

She couldn’t do anything because the old man would act against Snowy if she did.

Meanwhile, An Nanjing, Sword Scroll, and Jian You were being kept busy by the other experts, so they couldn’t help at all.

Most importantly, the woman in a white dress had moved her gaze toward Snowy and her.

Erya felt helpless!

For the first time, she felt quite helpless. She wasn’t afraid of being defeated, but this situation wasn’t something that could be resolved by just fighting. If she saved one, the other would be lost.

Erya held Snowy tight and didn’t let her charge over.

Meanwhile, the gray robed old man was itching to make a move, and he was ready to act at a moment’s notice.

Yi Shuihan placed her hands behind her back and looked down at Snowy while smiling coldly, “A Sprite Progenitor.”

She was about to attack once she finished speaking, but a pillar of golden light shot up into the air.

The Primal True Dragon!

It stood between Yi Shuihan and Snowy while glaring angrily at her with its huge eyes.

Yi Shuihan gazed indifferently at the dragon, “A pure blooded Primal True Dragon. A truly rare sight. If you were in the same realm of cultivation as me, then I would fear you. Unfortunately, you’re no different than an ant to me right now.”

As soon as she finished speaking, she raised her hand gently. In an instant, a powerful wave of pressure swept down from above, and it grew stronger and stronger as it descended. In the end, it converged into a torrent that slammed against the Primal True Dragon!

The Primal True Dragon’s eyes were filled with viciousness, and it roared with fury as it shot up into the air and slammed itself against the pressure!

Boom!

The sky trembled, and then a miserable howl resounded.

It was the Primal True Dragon!

The powerful pressure had instantly blasted apart its scales. The Primal True Dragon was already severely injured, and now that it had suffered the full strength of Yi Shuihan, it could be said to have suffered a severe injury over an already severely injured body!

But it didn’t retreat!

Not in the slightest!

A powerful wave of pressure incessantly rippled through the sky.

Since the beginning of the battle, it had never lowered its head! In its lifetime, it had only lowered its head to two, and they were Erya and Snowy!

It refused to lower its head! And it refused to retreat!

In the sky, the Primal True Dragon kept slamming itself at Yi Shuihan without the slightest fear of death!

However, it was constantly heavily injured instead.

Erya stared at the sky. She wanted to help, but she couldn’t. She couldn’t leave Snowy.

Everyone’s true objective was Snowy!

Snowy was about to charge over, but Erya forcefully kept Snowy from going over.

Bang!

Suddenly, a colossus crashed down from above.

It was the Primal True Dragon. While it was powerful, the gap in cultivation between it and Yi Shuihan was too, too huge.

It was no match for her!

After she dealt with the Primal True Dragon, Yi Shuihan gazed at Snowy and Erya.

Yi Shuihan stared at Snowy’s tear-covered face, “You’re sad? Haha, worse things are coming. I’ll kill everyone linked to her. I want all of you to die miserably, including you, Sprite Progenitor! Others dare not kill you, but I am going to try!”

As soon as she finished speaking, she charged at Snowy and Erya.

Suddenly, the Primal True Dragon’s almost dying figure charged up at her.

A wisp of ghastly killing intent flashed through her eyes, and then she grasped her fist in the dragon’s direction.

Crack!

The Primal True Dragon’s head instantly started to crack open, and blood sprayed out like fountains from all over its head!

A ferocious smile arose on the corners of Yi Shuihan’s mouth, “I’ve never slaughtered a dragon! So I’ll try it today!”

She slowly clenched her right fist as she spoke.

Crack!

The space in the surroundings shook violently!
