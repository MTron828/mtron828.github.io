Chapter 467 – Acknowledged!

The Southern An Clan.

Only Yang Ye and An Biru remained in the room.

Actually, Yang Ye didn’t want to come and meet An Biru. Because they were already on opposing sides right now, so what was the point of meeting? He didn’t know why An Biru formed an alliance with Luo Jun, but he was very clearly aware that it was a fact which he couldn’t change at all.

He knew his own limits.

“There seems to be enmity between you and the Mortal Emperor?” An Biru spoke abruptly.

Yang Ye nodded.

“I can help mediate between the two of you!” said An Biru.

Yang Ye gazed at her with astonishment.

An Biru said, “The union of the entire southern territory is a development that can’t be resisted. It isn’t something you can stop. Because some clans in the central territory and even some Ninth Rank Sects have formed an agreement with Luo Jun to help him unite the southern territory. No, I should say to unite the entire continent. So, going against him is equivalent to going against numerous clans and sects, understand?”

“What did he promise all of you?” Yang Ye was very curious about exactly what Luo Jun had promised these sects and clans that they had actually formed an alliance with him.

An Biru pondered deeply for a short moment before she said, “He’ll allow all of our sects and clans to establish ourselves in the various territories once the continent is united. Simply speaking, if he were to unite the southern territory, then those Ninth Rank Sects and clans of the central territory would be able to set up their sects and clans in the southern territory to recruit disciples and strengthen themselves. Can any sect or clan refuse the temptation of allowing their forces to cover the entire continent?”

So that’s it. Yang Ye came to an understanding and said, “What did he promise the An Clan?”

“To allow the An Clan’s businesses to cover the entire continent!” An Biru said, “I had no reason to refuse because the circumstances are in his favor, and refusal would represent war. At that time, the colossus which he represents, the Exalted Han Empire, would stand behind him while he’s assisted by the sects and clans. The An Clan wouldn’t be able to resist him!”

Yang Ye frowned. Based on what she just said, the Founding Emperor and Beast Emperor are in a very bad situation. Because just the two empires are utterly incapable of resisting the joint forces of the Exalted Han Empire and the clans and sects of the central territory. Not to mention that the potential threats like the Origin School and the other sects within the southern territory haven’t been eliminated!“The enmity between you and Luo Jun isn’t one that must end with one of your deaths. I should be able to reconcile the two of you if I were to step forward and mediate. He’ll definitely attach great importance to you with the ability you possess,” said An Biru.

Yang Ye gazed at An Biru and just stared her in the eyes. The latter frowned a little, and she was just about to speak when Yang Ye suddenly shook his head and said, “I suddenly realized that perhaps we’re not suitable for each other. I know you have good intentions, and I appreciate it. You don’t have to hold back if we meet in battle in the future because you don’t owe me anything. In the same way, I won’t hold back as well. Because I never show mercy to my enemies!”

Yang Ye turned around and walked away upon finishing.

An Biru’s figure stiffened, and she was slightly dazed as she watched Yang Ye walk away, step by step. Enemies. Would I become enemies with him? Or perhaps he has already taken me to be his enemy from this moment onward? Yes, he definitely has. He’s selfish, petty, and he doesn’t tolerate anything. Since I’ve become allies with his enemy, then he has definitely taken me to be his enemy by now....But did I make a mistake? I didn’t. The An Clan can only survive by following the tide. I’m the leader of the An Clan, so my actions are naturally not wrong. But doing this is equivalent to becoming enemies with him! Am I willing to become enemies with him?

Yang Ye didn’t turn around. He knew that it was quite unfair to An Biru, but it couldn’t be helped. He had no other choice. Since she’d made her decision, then they could only be enemies. Now that they’d made everything clear between them, they wouldn’t have to hold back at all when they fought in the future. That was undoubtedly for the best.

Yang Ye stopped moving because the black clothes woman had appeared before him.

Yang Ye was quite annoyed and said, “Do you realize that you’re very annoying?” If he had sufficient strength, then he would definitely strip off her black clothes and torture her a hundred times... no, a thousand times. Because she constantly threatened him and liked to blame him for everything. That really annoyed him.

A strand of coldness assaulted him, and it made Yang Ye’s entire body shudder uncontrollably.

“Apologize to her!” The black clothed woman’s voice was extremely cold and without even a trace of emotion.

Yang Ye said, “Madam An, I don’t want to become enemies with you. But unfortunately, you’ve chosen to stand on his side. I can’t say that your choice is wrong, but it’s a fact that we’ve become enemies. Since it has come to that, then what do you want me to say or do?”

“You’ll die!” An Biru’s voice resounded from behind him.

Yang Ye shook his head and said, “You don’t understand me, and I don’t understand you. Hah. Let’s just leave it at this. I truly dislike acting hesitantly or irresolutely. Farewell!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye didn’t stay here for another moment. He quickened his footsteps and swiftly vanished from her field of vision.

“Aunt, did I make a mistake?” An Biru gazed at the black clothed woman.

The black clothed woman said in a low voice, “He is narrow-minded and extremely ruthless. Most importantly, his natural talent and strength are extremely terrifying. If he were to mature successfully, then he would be even more terrifying than the Sword Sect’s Master. However, would he even be able to stay alive until then? The Mortal Emperor would never give him a chance to mature! So, you’re not mistaken. There’s no need to feel guilty because of him because it isn’t worth it!”

An Biru suddenly said, “Do you think the Mortal Emperor will really be able to unite the southern territory?”

The black clothed woman was shocked and said, “Little Girl, could it be that you intend to go back on your word?”

An Biru shook her head and said, “I naturally wouldn’t play around with the entire An Clan’s fate. I originally felt that the Mortal Emperor would definitely be able to unite the southern territory, but now....”

“What can he do by himself?” The black clothed woman spoke in a low voice.

“I don’t know. It’s just a feeling I have. I feel that Luo Jun will probably be unable to unite the southern territory with ease,” said An Biru.

“Just forget him. It’s impossible for the two of you to be together. I noticed that Luo Jun seems to be attracted to you. He’s an outstanding genius of the current era, so....”

An Biru didn’t know what to say.

After he left, Yang Ye took a deep breath. Even though he didn’t want to become enemies with the An Clan, but it couldn’t be helped because they were bound to be enemies now. Since they were enemies, then he had to be careful in the future because the assassins of the An Clan were extremely difficult to deal with. This was something he knew very well.

As for An Biru....

Yang Ye shook his head and erased this name from his mind. What could he do when she’d chosen to stand on Luo Jun’s side? So, he’d decided to let it go away with the wind.

The conflicted and hesitant expression in Yang Ye’s eyes instantly vanished without a trace when he thought up to this point, and those expressions were replaced by icy coldness. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Yang Ye withdrew a transmission talisman and activated it. He utilized the transmission talisman to tell Xiao Yuxi who was waiting over 50km away about everything that occurred here, and he asked Xiao Yuxi to return to the Darkbeast Empire and ask both the Beast Emperor and Founding Emperor to start preparing.

The current situation was truly quite bad because the Grand Qin Empire and Darkbeast Empire would really be unable to resist Luo Jun if he had the support of the Exalted Han Empire, the two An Clans, and those sects and clans from the central territory.

It’s still a hopeless situation right now!Yang Ye remained silently on the spot for a short while, and then he flipped his palm. The Mortal Emperor Armor and Mortal Emperor Seal appeared in his palm. Yang Ye’s expression was slightly gloomy as he gazed at these Natural Dao Artifacts. Because he wasn’t able to utilize them at all, and it was especially so for the Mortal Emperor Armor. It had even played tricks on him at the critical moment and almost caused his death. This made Yang Ye extremely furious!

Yang Ye pondered deeply for a short while before he suddenly said, “Can you help me with something?”

As soon as he finished speaking, a little girl appeared in front of Yang Ye. She was floating in midair while holding a scepter in her hand, and she seemed very proud.

“Since you’re so weak, go ahead and speak!” said the little girl.

The corners of Yang Ye’s mouth twitched. He really wanted to give her a good beating if he had the strength. He suppressed the unrealistic thoughts in his mind and said, “These two treasures are Natural Dao Artifacts that are extremely formidable, but I’m unable to utilize them. Are you able to eliminate their Equipment Spirits?”

The little girl’s gaze descended onto the Mortal Emperor Armor, and then she knocked it with her scepter and said, “Get out here!”

A strand of gold light flashed before the small golden dragon appeared here. It glanced at Yang Ye first before it gazed at the little girl, and terror appeared in its eyes when it saw the little girl.

“Why don’t you acknowledge him as your master?” The little girl pointed at Yang Ye and questioned the small golden dragon.

Yang Ye was stunned.

The golden dragon glanced at Yang Ye before it shook its head, and then it ceaselessly swam about the little girl as if it were explaining something.

Bang!

The little girl suddenly struck the golden dragon on the head with her scepter, and it instantly laid prone on the ground and was shivering.

The little girl said, “Cut the crap! If it wasn’t because it was difficult for you to cultivate to such a level, I would have smashed your consciousness apart and make you return to a muddled state. Make your decision! Are you willing to acknowledge him as your master or not? I’ll smash you to death if you refuse!”

Yang Ye was speechless.

The small golden dragon gazed at the little girl with a wronged expression, yet the little girl wasn’t moved by it at all. She raised her little hand, and a crystal blue ball of light flickered on her hand.

The small golden dragon gazed at Yang Ye in the end, and then it flew over to Yang Ye with extreme unwillingness. After that, a strand of golden light suddenly erupted from the golden dragon as Yang Ye watched with excitement, and then the golden light entered into the center of his brows. A short while later, Yang Ye revealed a delighted expression because he was actually able to clearly sense the small golden dragon’s current emotions!

The little girl withdrew her hand and said, “It has acknowledged you as its master, so you can use these two pieces of trash from now on. I’m going back to rest. I’m going to cultivate and recover my strength from now on, so I’ll probably be unable to show myself for a very long period. Don’t go getting yourself in trouble. Understand?”

“What do you mean by not getting myself in trouble?” said Yang Ye.

The little girl frowned and thought for a long time before she said, “Don’t offend people you can’t defeat. Understand?”

“Then what if someone I can’t defeat offends me?” said Yang Ye.

“Kill that person!” The little girl spoke as a matter of course.

“What if I can’t?”

“Then run....”
