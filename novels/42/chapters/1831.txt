Chapter 1832 – Nether Ghoststeps!

Yang Ye was stunned.

He had never expected this. Blood Maiden had actually bowed to the young girl!

What’s going on? Yang Ye’s mind was filled with questions!

The young girl frowned slightly, “Who are you?”

Meanwhile, Nether Maiden, Blind Maiden, and the pig-riding young woman appeared beside Yang Ye. Their eyes had a trace of complicated emotions as they gazed at the young girl.

“Nether Dream!” Meanwhile, Blood Maiden said, “Your name is Nether Dream!”

The young girl frowned, “Nether Dream…” A lost expression appeared in her eyes. A long while passed before she spoke softly, “That seems to be my name.”

Blood Maiden and Blind Maiden exchanged glances. In the end, Blood Maiden asked, “You don’t know your own name?”

The young girl’s frown grew deeper. A short while passed before she suddenly gazed at Blood Maiden, “You know me?”

Blood Maiden spoke in a low voice, “You lost your memories?”

The young girl spoke coldly, “No, I just can’t remember a lot of things!” UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Meanwhile, Yang Ye gazed at Blood Maiden, “Second Sister, she’s from the Nether Pavilion too?”

Nether Maiden nodded slightly, “She’s the guardian of my Nether Pavilion, and her status is only below the pavilion master. Only the pavilion master can give her orders. At the same time, she’s the instructor of my Nether Pavilion. Eldest Sister and I were taught by her. However, it was when we were young.”

The Nether Pavilion’s guardian and instructor… Yang Ye gulped. No wonder she was so terrifying!

Meanwhile, Blood Maiden continued, “Actually, I suspected it in the beginning. However, I wasn’t sure because the movement technique she used earlier was the Nether Ghoststeps technique which has been lost to my Nether Pavilion for years. Only the pavilion master and guardian cultivate it. Eldest Sister and I merely saw it once when we were young.”

She gazed at the young girl and continued, “The reason I’m sure now is that ring. The Nether Ghostring. It’s the symbol of identity for the Nether Pavilion’s guardian, and it’s the second greatest treasure of the Nether Pavilion.”

Yang Ye chuckled, “So we’re on the same side! Haha!”

“No I’m not!” Meanwhile, Ghost Dream spoke coldly, “I don’t care who all of you are or who I am. In any case, she said that no outsiders can come here. So, either leave now or die!”

Blood Maiden asked, “She’s Pavilion Master Siyou, right?”

“The Pavilion Master….” Nether Dream frowned again while a lost expression appeared in her eyes.

Meanwhile, Blood Maiden added, “Instructor, has our pavilion master gone to the large universe, or has she fallen?”

Nether Dream’s frown grew deeper.

A long time passed before she suddenly looked towards the right and said, “She went over there.”

Blood Maiden asked, “You’ve never gone there to have a look?”

Nether Dream shook her head, “She didn’t allow it, so I didn’t dare to.”

Yang Ye’s eyelids twitched. She seems to be really afraid of the Nether Pavilion’s master!

Blood Maiden asked, “How long have you been guarding this place?”

Nether Dream shook her head slightly, “I don’t know. It has been very, very long.” She gazed at Blood Maiden, “I remember something, and it’s that my name is Nether Dream. But I don’t remember you!”

Blood Maiden replied, “It’s fine. You can think about it slowly.” She gazed towards the direction that Nether Dream had gazed towards earlier, “We want to go have a look there. Can we?”

“No!” Nether Dream’s face instantly turned icy cold, “She said that no one can go over there. No one!”

Blood Maiden replied, “Are you going to guard this place forever?”

The young girl was slightly stunned, and then she fell silent. But it only took a moment for her to say, “I can’t leave without her orders!”

“How pedantic!” Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly said, “Have you thought about how she might have only wanted you to guard this place for some time and not forever? She hasn’t shown herself after heading over there, so she may have left by now. Or perhaps she’s in some sort of trouble! She….”

“Impossible!” Nether Dream said, “No one can kill her!”

Yang Ye glanced at Nether Dream, “Is she very formidable?”

Nether Dream suddenly pointed at Yang Ye, “She can fight a hundred people like you!”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

Meanwhile, Blind Maiden suddenly said, “Instructor, we understand that you’re loyal to the pavilion master, but have you thought about how it has been so long? Is that normal? It’s not normal at all. Just as Little Yang said, something must have happened, and that’s why she hasn’t said anything to you!”

Little Yang! The corners of Yang Ye’s mouth twitched. She actually gave me a nickname!

Nether Dream fell silent again. A short while passed before she looked towards the distance. It was where Shao Siyou had vanished. A wisp of bewilderment appeared in her eyes as she looked in that direction!

Yang Ye immediately understood what she was thinking. Even she wanted to know what happened to Shao Siyou.

So, Yang Ye hurriedly said, “Just think about it. Perhaps she needs our help? Or perhaps certain reasons made her unable to contact you before leaving? If that happened, standing on guard here would be a complete waste of time, right?”

Nether Dream turned to look at Yang Ye, “You made me go there. If she wants to punish someone, I’ll say that you made me!”

Yang Ye almost cursed, “What the….”

What the heck is wrong with her? She wants to go look, but she wants to put the blame on me?!

Meanwhile, Nether Dream suddenly added, “I didn’t want to go, but what you said does make sense. Moreover, all of you intend to go there, and I can’t defeat all of you. So, I have no choice but to go with you. Thus, all of this is your idea, right?”

All of them were speechless.

Around 15 minutes later, all of them set off towards the distance.

Yang Ye walked over to Blood Maiden’s side and said, “Second Sister, why do I get the feeling that your pavilion master isn’t a normal person?”

Blood Maiden glanced at Yang Ye, “What are you trying to say?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “I don’t know. It’s just a feeling. So, do you know her identity and background?”

Blood Maiden shook her head, “Actually, she’s very mysterious even in our Nether Pavilion. No one knows about her past, and she has never spoken about it.”

“Mysterious!” Yang Ye was about to say something else when Nether Dream suddenly appeared before him. Yang Ye’s expression changed slightly while he became vigilant. After all, she wasn’t a weakling!

Nether Dream sized up Yang Ye, “Your skin is really thick. How did you train it?”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

Nether Dream suddenly added, “That flame of yours is pretty good too. Where did you get it?”

Yang Ye instantly became extremely vigilant. She wants the Divine Yin Flame!

Meanwhile, Blood Maiden suddenly spoke, “We’ve arrived!”

All of them stopped. A bottomless abyss was before them. Yang Ye walked over to the edge and looked down. The area 300m below him was covered in milk white mist, but his vision was naturally able to see through mist with ease.

However, even his vision couldn’t reach the bottom of the abyss!

It was bottomless!

Yang Ye gazed at Nether Dream, “She went down from here?”

Nether Dream nodded.

Yang Ye asked, “She didn’t say why she went down there?”

Nether Dream shook her head.

Yang Ye gazed at Blood Maiden, and the latter nodded slightly, “Let’s head down there!”

As soon as she finished speaking, Blind Maiden and her jumped down. As for the pig-riding young woman and Nether Maiden, they entered the Primordial Pagoda.

Yang Ye glanced at Nether Dream, and then he jumped down as well.

Nether Dream was clearly quite hesitant. Obviously, she was still worried about something. But it didn’t take long for her to jump down as well.

Around 15 minutes after they leaped down, a woman with a veil over her face appeared where Yang Ye had been standing just now.

She looked down the abyss for a long time and said, “I didn’t expect even the guardian to be here… It’s really getting more and more interesting!”

She suddenly looked towards the distance at this point, “Since you’re here, why continue hiding?”

As soon as she finished speaking, the space there trembled slightly, and then a woman in a wheelchair appeared.

It was the owner of Sword Immortal City, the Martial Envoy of the Nether Pavilion!

The veiled woman sized up the Martial Envoy and said, “It has been quite a while. You don’t seem to be doing very well!”

“I’m not doing well?” The Martial Envoy chuckled, “Indeed. I really am not if it’s compared to you. You’ve become the pavilion master, after all. But allow me to be honest, what right do you have to be the pavilion master?”

The veiled woman said, “The Nether Pavilion became disorganized once Pavilion Master Siyou left. If I didn’t take the position of pavilion master, our Nether Pavilion would have become history. I reorganized the Nether Pavilion and allowed its legacy to continue. Is that wrong?”

The Martial Envoy spoke indifferently, “A Nether Pavilion without Master isn’t the Nether Pavilion!”

The veiled woman gazed at the Martial Envoy for a long time and replied, “There’s no common ground for understanding between us!”

The Martial Envoy nodded slightly, “True!”

As soon as she finished speaking, she leaped down the abyss.

The veiled woman looked down for a long time, and then she spoke softly, “It’s time for a very old mystery to finally be uncovered…”

She leaped down once she finished speaking.

The surroundings fell silent.

Around 15 minutes later, the entire mountain suddenly started shaking.
