Chapter 2371 – Nothing!

Snowy was quite stunned as she held the two fruits in her paws.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye walked over to her. Snowy put the fruits aside and started waving her claws swiftly, growing increasingly excited over time. But in the end, it was dejection that covered her face.

An absolute treasure!

Snowy was telling him that the bamboo chest was a great treasure. A very, very good one. The best she’d ever seen!

Yang Ye rubbed Snowy’s head and spoke softly, “We’ve gained a lot already, haven’t we?”

Snowy was still quite dejected because it had been communicating with her. In other words, it was willing to choose her!

But it didn’t take long for Snowy’s gaze to fall on the fruits.

Meanwhile, Oxxy, the Primal True Dragon, and Erya left Yang Ye’s body. The dragon stared at the fruit while burning desire and greed was clearly visible in its eyes.

Oxxy was staring at them too. However, it held back a little and frequently gazed at Snowy.

It was very well aware that Snowy was the fruits’ owner.

As for Erya, she was better than both of them. She grabbed one of them and started sizing it up.

Snowy wasn’t infuriated by this because she was very close with Erya. Every time Erya had a tanghulu, she would let Snowy have a few licks, so they always had tanghulu together.

They were very close!

Wang Erya sized it up for a long time and said, “This fruit is very good.”

She passed it to Snowy.

Snowy blinked, and then passed it back to her. Obviously, she was giving it to Erya.

Erya shook her head, “It’s yours. It’s a treasure, so you eat it!”

Snowy glanced at Yang Ye, glanced at Erya, and then passed it to Erya again.

Erya shook her head and spoke very seriously, “It’s really very good, so you have it.”

Snowy thought for a moment, and then she took a bite before passing it to Erya. Erya thought for a moment and took a bite too.

Oxxy and the Primal True Dragon’s eyes almost popped out. Especially the dragon, it was even drooling… Not, that was Dragon Saliva!

A short while later, Snowy seemed to have thought of something and gazed at Oxxy, causing the latter to become nervous.

Snowy thought for a moment, gazed at the fruit, and then pulled. The fruit was split into two, but it didn’t seem to be enough. So, Snowy put them together and pulled again.

Four pieces!

The fruit had been turned into four pieces!

Snowy gave Erya one and Oxxy one. At this moment, Oxxy was trembling with happiness. At this moment, it wouldn’t hesitate to do anything Snowy asked of it.

As for the last two pieces, Snowy gazed at the Primal True Dragon. It instantly became nervous. Snowy hesitated for a moment and passed one to the Primal True Dragon. It gulped, gazed at Snowy, and then pointed at the fruit. It was asking if it was really for it!

Snowy tossed it over to the Primal True Dragon, and the latter grabbed it immediately. However, it glanced at Snowy.

Snowy still had one more fruit!

Snowy gazed at it, and then suddenly vanished. She entered the Primordial Pagoda, or to be more precise, she’d gone to Zi’er. She cracked a smile and passed it to Zi’er.

Zi’er was stunned.

A short while later, Zi’er rubbed Snowy’s head and said, “You have it!”

Snowy shook her head and started waving her paws. She was telling Zi’er that it was very, very useful to her.

Actually, Zi’er had sensed it. As soon as she saw the fruit, she knew that it could take her to an unprecedented height. She gazed at Snowy, and her heart felt really warm as she gazed at the mischievous little fellow before her.

She took the fruit, split it in half, and gave half to Snowy, “We’ll share it, alright?”

Snowy thought for a moment and nodded. After that, she took it and left the Primordial Pagoda.

Zi’er took a small bite and its juices flowed within her. In an instant, her body shook violently, and then countless strands of violet light surged out around her. At the same time, her aura rose explosively.

Outside the Primordial Pagoda, Snowy went over to Yang Ye. She pointed at the fruit, pointed at Yang Ye, and then waved her paw. She was saying that it wouldn’t help Yang Ye at all!

Yang Ye rubbed her little head and smiled, “It’s fine, you eat it!”

Snowy shook her head instead. She raised her paw, and there were two pitch black seeds in her grasp. She cracked a smile at Yang Ye and placed them in the rear mountains of the Sword Sect within the Primordial Pagoda.

From this moment onward, Snowy had another job every day, and it was to nourish the seeds with spirit energy. Not only with the spirit energy from her, but Primordial Violet Energy too.

As for the other half, Snowy didn’t eat it, nor did she give it away. She hid it away somewhere even Yang Ye didn’t know, and he didn’t know what she planned to do with it either.

The Primal True Dragon, Oxxy, and Wang Erya exchanged glances after they consumed their share of the fruit. In the end, the Primal True Dragon and Oxxy returned to the rear mountains in the Primordial Pagoda, and then powerful auras swept out from there.

As for Erya, she seemed very calm. However, Yang Ye could sense that changes were occurring within her. However, it wasn’t as obvious as the dragon and Oxxy.

Meanwhile, Nanli Meng suddenly asked, “Is he gone?”

Yang Ye gazed at her and nodded.

She said, “Then let’s go!”

As she spoke, she walked off toward the depths of the gorge.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye asked, “Don’t you want to know who it was?”

She smiled, “He only allowed you to see him, so that represents that it’s your fortune. Thus, what’s the point of me finding out?”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and said, “He asked me to pass you a message.”

Nanli Meng was quite curious, “What?”

Yang Ye replied, “He said your aspirations are great, and your path is very special and interesting too. Besides that, he said you shouldn’t try to force things too much, because forcing something is obsession, and obsession comes in shades of both good and bad. A single hindered thought may destroy everything.”

“Do not obsess!” Nanli Meng closed her eyes slowly, and a long time passed before she opened them again. She gazed at the entrance of the gorge and said, “Thank you.”

As she spoke, she gazed at Yang Ye, “Congratulations.”

Obviously, Yang Ye had obtained a very, very huge amount of benefits.

Yang Ye smiled, “It was all thanks to Snowy. I wouldn’t have been able to get anything without her.”

Nanli Meng glanced at Snowy who was snoring on Yang Ye’s shoulder. Snowy was just lying there on Yang Ye’s shoulder with her arms around his neck. It was like she was hanging from him.

She felt very safe like that!

Up until now, Nanli Meng still couldn’t figure out why a Sprite Progenitor would rely on Yang Ye so much. Moreover, Yang Ye was even someone who killed a lot!

Actually, when someone was in their most difficult moment, it’s also the time they remember kindness most easily. Even if it was just a small kindness. Snowy had met Yang Ye at her darkest moment, so she stayed with him forever!

They continued forward. The gorge was huge, and they finally walked out of it around an hour later.

At this moment, the sky had darkened.

The veil of night descended. There was no moonlight, and the world was covered in darkness.

Snowy had sensed a good treasure, and it was up ahead. Actually, Snowy was quite disinterested now. Her mind was filled with the small bamboo chest. It wasn’t that the chest itself was very good, but there were numerous treasures within it!

Nanli Meng glanced at the surroundings and said, “Let’s stop here.”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Why?”

She glanced into the distance, “Ghosts roam at night!”

Yang Ye was stunned speechless.VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

They sat down at the exit of the gorge, and Yang Ye entered the Primordial Pagoda.

The blood of a god!

Yang Ye withdrew the white jade bottle and the Myriad World Diagram. His gaze descended on the blood. Give it to Invincible and the Sword Precursor? He’d thought of it, but it only took a moment for him to abandon that thought.

While it could improve them, he hadn’t forgotten what the old man had told him. It would destroy their spirits. Even Invincible had a spirit, it was the vengeful spirits, of course.

After he abandoned that thought, Yang Ye opened the bottle. There were five drops of blood within it, dark red drops of blood.

Consume one?

Meanwhile, Sword Scroll appeared by his side. She glanced at them, “It’s best if you don’t consume them for now. It’s not ordinary. If you can’t endure their strength, you won’t just be unable to improve your strength, you may destroy yourself.”

Yang Ye nodded. The energy within the blood made even his heart palpitate slightly. Simply speaking, his intuition told him that he would suffer terribly if he consumed the blood.

But it was best for him to remain at his prime in this damnable place.

Besides that, he had to stay vigilant against Nanli Meng. He didn’t want to fall into a trap!

Suddenly, Sword Scroll said, “Go to Bai Zhixian!”

Yang Ye was about to ask when she left. He hesitated for a moment and went to Bai Zhixian’s mountain, Immortal Radiance Peak. It was a name Bai Zhixian had given it.

In a palace, a wave of fragrance assaulted him as soon as he entered the hall.

Yang Ye walked inside, and there was a large bath deep within it. A woman was lying silently in the pool.

It was Bai Zhixian.

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and said, “Give me a moment!”

He left the Primordial Pagoda and gazed at Nanli Meng who was seated cross-legged nearby, “I’m going inside to cultivate for a while. I’ll leave our safety to you.”

He immediately entered the Primordial Pagoda once he finished speaking.

At the side of the pool, Yang Ye waved his right hand, and his clothes vanished. Meanwhile, Bai Zhixian suddenly stood up.

She had nothing on her!
