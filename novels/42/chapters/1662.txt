Chapter 1663 - You Fight! I’ll Run!

Translator: InVader

At the moment Yang Ye chopped off the linen robed old man’s head, Ku Rong and the other old man’s expressions had become extremely unsightly.

They hadn’t expected that Yang Ye would really dare to kill the old man in a linen robe.

The old man in a luxurious robe gazed at Yang Ye, “Do you realize what you’ve done?”

“What I’ve done?” Yang Ye chuckled, “Actually, I didn’t want to do that. But it can’t be helped. You people from large clans always consider yourself to be superior to others, and you think that others should give you face. When others give you face, you think it’s a matter of course; but if others refuse to give you face, you feel that person isn’t sensible and should be taught a lesson!”

Yang Ye shook his head at this point and continued, “The way I, Yang Ye, do things is that if someone respects me, then I’ll respect them; if others don’t respect me and want to bully me, then I’m sorry. It doesn’t matter if that person is from your Ku Clan, I’d still kill that person even if he’s the son of God!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye turned around and walked away.

However, Ku Rong and the old man in a luxurious robe appeared not too far away from him. The old man stared at Yang Ye and said, “You intend to just walk away after killing him?”

Yang Ye spoke indifferently, “What? You want me to kill two more?”

The old man’s eyes narrowed slightly, “You’re that confident?”

Yang Ye gazed at the old man, “Why don’t you give it a try?”

The old man gazed at Yang Ye for a short while. He didn’t say anything and just stretched out his right hand. A wave of powerful energy instantly shook the space around Yang Ye. But it didn’t take long for a wave of red light to surge out from within Yang Ye, and then the old man’s energy was dispersed in an instant!

The old man tapped his right foot down and transformed into a ray of white light that shot towards Yang Ye.

At the same time, Yang Ye drew his sword and swung it!

Bang!

Space shook violently, and then Yang Ye was pushed 300m back while the old man was merely pushed less than 30m back!

Yang Ye glanced at the old man from afar. Needless to say, while the old man in a luxurious robe and the linen robed old man were both Half-Step True Realm experts, the old man in a luxurious robe was much stronger than the linen robed old man.

The old man glanced at Yang Ye, and then he stretched out his right hand and twisted it swiftly!

In an instant, the space around Yang Ye started to move. The powerful energy within it caused Yang Ye to feel like his body was being pulled apart by numerous horses. Yang Ye didn’t dare act carelessly, and he immediately raised his sword and slashed.

Bang!

The space around him collapsed and was obliterated. A moment later, a ray of light shot out of the expanse of collapsed space and instantly appeared before the old man.

The old man’s expression remained calm, and he tapped his finger forward. The space before him suddenly started to spin, and it swept Yang Ye into it. However, it only took a moment for a blood red ray of light to flash out from there.

The old man’s eyes narrowed slightly, and he slapped his palm forward.

Bang!

An explosion resounded, and the old man was pushed around 30m back. As for the spinning vortex of space in front of him, it had been sliced into strings by Yang Ye’s sword energy while Yang Ye’s figure had appeared in front of the old man before stabbing his sword forward.

It was swift to the absolute limit, and even the old man in a luxurious robe merely saw a ray of light flash before him.

The old man didn’t dare act carelessly, and he immediately raised a small black shield in front of himself.

Bang!

The shield shook violently, and then a ray of black light shot out from it.

Yang Ye’s expression changed from the sight of the black light, and he quickly raised his sword and slashed it forward.

Bang!

An explosion resounded, and Yang Ye was pushed almost 1km back.

Yang Ye glanced at the black shield from afar. It was obvious that the shield was a Zenith Rank treasure!

“You’re not bad indeed!” Meanwhile, the old man in a luxurious robe said, “However, not to mention that you’re just a young master of the Yang Clan, even if you’re the Yang Clan’s successor, my Ku Clan will still kill you without any hesitation!”

As he spoke, he took a step forward, and then he tapped the black shield in front of him. In an instant, it transformed into a black vortex that swept towards Yang Ye.

Everywhere it passed, space was instantly sliced into pieces!

Yang Ye’s eyes drooped as he gazed at the black vortex. It didn’t take long for the shield to get closer and closer.

Suddenly, Yang Ye looked up. But right when the old man and Ku Rong thought he would swing his sword, Yang Ye’s figure shook and charged towards the black vortex. In an instant, Yang Ye’s figure was sucked into it!

Both the old men were quite stunned by this, and bewilderment filled their eyes.

Suddenly, the old man’s expression changed drastically, “How dare you!”

He was about to act, but the black vortex suddenly vanished, and then a ray of light shot out from there.

Bang!

The old man was pushed around 100m back, and Yang Ye had appeared before Ku Rong and the old man.

Ku Rong’s eyes instantly narrowed when he saw Yang Ye, and they were filled with disbelief.

Because Yang Ye was completely unharmed!

Of course he was unharmed! Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

He possessed Zenith Rank Laws of Darkness and coupled with the unique physique he possessed right now, it could be said that he was fully immune to dark matter and dark energy!

But the energy created by that black shield was formed from dark matter and dark energy. So, it was completely harmless to Yang Ye!

That was exactly why he was completely unharmed, and he’d even placed the black shield within the Primordial Pagoda.

The old man stared at Yang Ye, “Where’s my shield?”

Yang Ye chuckled, “Why are you asking me when it’s your shield?”

A wisp of the intent to kill flashed through the old man’s eyes, “Dammit!”

As he spoke, he moved slightly sideways while raising his hands a little. A moment later, he slapped them down in Yang Ye’s direction, “Thousand Waves!”

The space before him instantly seemed to have transformed into an ocean, and it started overlapping in layers.

At this moment, Yang Ye felt like he was in an ocean that had tidal waves raging through it, and the space there seemed like ocean water that was trying to drown him.

In just an instant, Yang Ye was submerged beneath that ocean of space.

A moment of silence ensued, and then a sword howl resounded from within it. After that, a ray of light shot out from there. Space was instantly sliced open wherever it went, and it didn’t take long for the ray of light to arrive before the old man in a luxurious robe.

Suddenly, the space before him was compressed in layers, and then it transformed into a palm that slapped forward in Yang Ye’s direction.

Bang!

The ray of light was dispersed while Yang Ye was blasted over 1km away.

Yang Ye gazed coldly at the old man from afar. As for the space between them, it was rippling lightly like ripples on the surface of a lake.

The old man in a luxurious robe stared at Yang Ye. He hadn’t expected Yang Ye to be so strong. Even though Yang Ye had always been at a disadvantage, he hadn’t been able to kill Yang Ye. Yang Ye’s attacks were extremely sharp and powerful while enhanced by Returnal Rank sword intent and Zenith Rank slaughter intent, and Yang Ye was even able to destroy his powerful techniques with ease!

He couldn’t do anything to Yang Ye!

That was what the old man felt right now!

He remained silent for a moment, and then he spoke in a low voice, “Let’s join forces.”

Ku Rong nodded when he heard this. Even if the old man didn’t say anything, he would still join the battle. Because he’d realized that the old man couldn’t do anything to Yang Ye.

Right when they were about to attack, Yang Ye suddenly said, “What? You intend to gang up on me?”

The old man in a luxurious robe said, “Don’t waste your breath on him! Attack! The Soul Nurturing Tree might be in his sea of consciousness!”

As he spoke, he shot forward like a bolt of lightning. Meanwhile, Ku Rong was about to attack as well, but a ray of golden light suddenly flashed.

Bang!

A muffled explosion resounded, and then the old man was blasted 300m away. At the same time, Ku Rong’s expression changed, and he hurriedly looked off into the distance. A woman with a spear in her grasp had suddenly appeared there.

It was An Nanjing!

The old man in a luxurious robe glanced at his palm. At this moment, his entire palm and arm had cracked open.

He fell silent for a moment before he looked up at An Nanjing, “Who are you?!”

An Nanjing didn’t speak. She just moved over to Yang Ye’s side, but her aura was still locked onto the old man.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly spoke, “If you attack me again, both of you’ll lose your heads today. Don’t start bringing up the Ku Clan. I just arrived in the Milky Way System, so I don’t know anything about how strong or mysterious the Ku Clan is. So, don’t force my hand! Otherwise, both of you might die a horrible death!”

A wisp of ferocity flashed through the old man’s eyes. He was about to attack when a voice suddenly resounded, “Both of you can’t do anything to them!”

The old man was stunned when he heard the voice, and then a respectful expression appeared on his face. It didn’t take long for a middle aged man to appear here.

The man was none other than the one-armed man Yang Ye had met earlier, the guardian of the Ku Clan, Ku Ming.

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly when he saw Ku Ming. The Ku Clan has even sent out a True Realm expert!Ku Ming walked over to Yang Ye and An Nanjing. He stopped not too far away from them and said, “No one dares to take from the Ku Clan, and no one can just kill a member of the Ku Clan.”

Yang Ye spoke indifferently, “No one can just insult a member of my Yang Clan too!”

“Well said!” Suddenly, a voice resounded, and then a violet armored man with a spear in his grasp walked out from a point of space that wasn’t too far behind Yang Ye.

“Yang Gewu!” Ku Rong and the other old man’s faces fell when they saw the man.

The Ku Clan had its guardian, and so did the Yang Clan. Yang Gewu was the Yang Clan’s guardian.

Ku Ming glanced at Yang Gewu, “I didn’t expect you to come yourself. However, can you stop me from killing them?”

“I can’t!” Yang Gewu spoke indifferently, “However, if you break the rule that all eight of our clans set, then my Yang Clan will naturally not abide by that rule anymore. If you kill the juniors of my Yang Clan, then I’ll kill the juniors of your Ku Clan. A life for a life! It’s a worthy exchange!”

The eight clans had jointly set a rule that the True Realm experts of the various clans couldn’t act against the juniors of the other clans. At the very least, they couldn’t do it openly!

Ku Ming fell silent for a moment, and then he said, “Does your Yang Clan want to go to war?”

Yang Gewu didn’t answer the question, and he gazed at Yang Ye instead, “What do you think?”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and replied, “You fight! I’ll run!”
