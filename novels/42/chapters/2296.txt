Chapter 2297 – It’s For Your Own Good!

Bai Zhixian’s heart twitched when she saw Yang Ye crying.

Because he actually had such a soft side.

The impression she had of Yang Ye was a shameless, ruthless, decisive, extreme, bold, and insane person. She had never imagined that this man who was more ruthless than most would actually cry!

How could this man cry if it wasn’t something that truly made him sad?

At this moment, she suddenly became quite curious about An Nanjing.

What kind of woman could make this man act like this?

Meanwhile, Yang Ye’s sword had vanished. He placed his right hand on her face, causing her to frown slightly and almost push him away. However, she seemed to have thought of something and gradually relaxed her clenched fist.

At this moment, while madness intent still remained around Yang Ye, it had much less viciousness and the desire to kill.

However, he still looked very unusual.

Yang Ye put his left hand around her waist and hugged her tight, causing the latter’s expression to turn extremely unsightly. But she didn’t dare to do anything.

Because An Nanjing wouldn’t attack Yang Ye!

If she attacked him, Yang Ye wouldn’t definitely instinctively realize that she wasn’t An Nanjing. At that time, the first he killed would be her, and then everyone in White Emperor City.

Based on Yang Ye’s current strength, he would be a calamity to White Emperor City once he went mad!

A terrible calamity!

Yang Ye just hugged her like that, and a long time passed before Bai Zhixian left her room. There was a man in a long robe by her side, and he was wearing a strange mask that fully concealed his appearance.

It was naturally Yang Ye.

Bai Zhixian naturally didn’t dare to let Yang Ye appear in public without keeping his identity concealed. Presently, the Shiyuan Clan was madly searching for Yang Ye. If they found out that he was here, they would definitely attack White Emperor City. The Shiyuan Clan wasn’t the only one, the other powers would join in too. Moreover, even the Immortal Estate would come for Yang Ye. After all, Yang Ye had killed the number one beauty of the Immortal Estate!

Even she was quite shocked about the fact that he’d killed her.

As far as she was concerned, he was really brave!

Bai Zhixian restrained her thoughts and glanced at Yang Ye. Yang Ye was treating her as An Nanjing, and wouldn’t leave her side. This gave her a huge headache. However, she didn’t dare to infuriate him. If he went mad again, no one would be able to restrain him.

It was both good and bad now!

Bai Zhixian shook her head and led Yang Ye into an underground palace.

There were two black robed men there. As soon as he saw them, Yang Ye suddenly vanished on the spot.

Bai Zhixian’s expression changed drastically, and she hurriedly said, “Stop!”

Bang! Bang!

As soon as she said that, the black robed men were blasted away, and Yang Ye was about to attack again. She suddenly appeared by his side and took his hand, causing Yang Ye to stop. Meanwhile, the vengeful spirits and madness intent around him slowly returned to his body.

Bai Zhixian heaved a sigh of relief, and then she looked to the side. While they were still alive, both of them were heavily injured, and one of them had even lost his arm.

Fortunately, Yang Ye hadn’t used the Sword Domain, or they would have been killed in an instant!

Bai Zhixian glanced at Yang Ye. His strength was much, much stronger than it had been. Especially after he comprehended madness intent, his strength was absolutely incomparable to what it had been! Moreover, besides madness intent, the vengeful spirits in his possession were extremely terrifying too. They had been brought to their full potential now, and they wanted to kill everyone they saw!

Bai Zhixian took a deep and long glance at Yang Ye, and then she said, “Don’t just kill anyone, understand?”

Yang Ye didn’t answer her.

She frowned. Actually, she was very clearly aware of the situation he was in. He was insane, and the most direct method to resolve this was to let Yang Ye’s sword intent and slaughter intent suppress his madness intent. So long as it was suppressed, Yang Ye would regain consciousness. However, the problem was that the joint forces of his sword intent and slaughter intent were no match for his madness intent!

Not to mention that the madness intent was assisted by the vengeful spirits! 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

It could be said that the sword intent and slaughter intent were completely defeated. They’d fought each other since the beginning, yet they lost to the madness intent in the end!

Obviously, they were definitely very aggrieved by this!

Bai Zhixian glanced at the black robed figures, “Stand down!”

They bowed respectfully and left without making a sound.

Bai Zhixian took Yang Ye’s hand and walked further into the palace. It didn’t take long for her to lead him to a room. She formed a strange seal, and then it started trembling.

Suddenly, Yang Ye frowned, and it shocked her. She hurriedly grabbed his hand, and he gradually calmed down.

Bai Zhixian seemed visibly relieved, and then she looked ahead. A round pillar had appeared before her, and atop it was a jade box. In the jade box were two purple tokens.

She gazed at them for a long time and spoke softly, “Do or die.”

As soon as she finished speaking, she took them and was about to leave with Yang Ye. However, Yang Ye suddenly turned around, and then a ray of sword energy flashed.

Bang!

An explosion resounded in the room, and then a black shadow appeared at a corner of the room.

Bai Zhixian’s expression turned extremely unsightly from the sight of this. She hadn’t expected someone to be here!

Yang Ye was about to attack, but she stopped him and gazed at the black clothed person, “Who are you?”

The latter replied, “White Empress, my Master wants those two Eternal Tokens. I wonder if you’ll be willing to give them to me?”

Eternal Tokens!

Bai Zhixian’s eyes narrowed slightly. She was about to speak when Yang Ye suddenly appeared above the black clothed person, and then a sword descended.

The Sword Domain!

The black clothed person was shocked, “That’s the Sword Domain! You’re Yang Ye! I-Impossible…”

As soon as the black clothed person finished speaking, the sword descended.

However, the black clothed person had vanished, and only black clothes remained on the ground.

Meanwhile, an explosion resounded from the entrance of the room, and then a figure was blasted back inside.

Bai Zhixian gazed coldly at the figure. She was about to speak, but a ray of light flashed, and then that figure was sliced into two.

The black clothed person was dead!

Bai Zhixian felt speechless.

Meanwhile, countless vengeful spirits appeared, and they pounced at the corpse.

Devouring resentment!

There was deep fear in her eyes as she gazed at the vengeful spirits. Suddenly, they finished devouring the resentment and immediately turned toward her, causing her to frown slightly.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye appeared by her side. As soon as he did, the vengeful spirits moved away from her.

They didn’t dare to challenge Yang Ye’s authority. Because once Yang Ye aroused the desire to kill, even they would die!

Bai Zhixian gazed at Yang Ye, “Let’s go!”

She led Yang Ye out of the room.

White Emperor Hall.

As soon as Bai Zhixian entered the hall, her face fell.

There was a man in there. He smiled when he saw her, “Zhixian, you’re here.”

She frowned slightly, “Nanli Xian, what are you doing here?”

The man smiled, “The Eternal Secret Realm is about to be opened. I presume you’ll be going, so I’m here to invite you to go with me.”

She replied indifferently, “Thank you, but that isn’t necessary.”

Nanli Xian was slightly stunned, and then he said, “Zhixian, we’ll be able to help each other if we stay together. Don’t you think so too?”

She replied, “It isn’t necessary. Please leave, I want to rest.”

He laughed bitterly, “Zhixian, why be so cold? I just want to have someone to watch my back and vice versa. I’m sure you’re aware that the other powers aren’t very friendly to White Emperor City. If something were to happen to you in the Eternal Secret Realm, then White Emperor City would probably…”

Bai Zhixian glanced at him, “Thanks for the reminder. However, I’ll let fate decide. If something happens to me there, it’s my destiny, and I can’t blame anyone for that.”

Nanli Xian gazed at her for a long time, and then he suddenly chuckled, “Fine, since you insist, I won’t say anything else, or you’ll get annoyed.”

He paused for a moment and said, “Zhixian, according to my knowledge, you have two Eternal Tokens. Can you give one to me?”

Her eyes narrowed slightly, “Nanli Xian, that’s the real reason you’re here, right?”

“Not at all!” He smiled, “Zhixian, let’s just be frank. Give me one of the Eternal Tokens in your possession, and my Nanli Clan will have three True Dao Realm experts in there. At that time, they can stay with you and protect you until you leave. Alright?”

Bai Zhixian replied, “What if I refuse?”

Nanli Xian’s smile gradually vanished, “Anything can happen in the Eternal Secret Realm. Don’t you think so too?”

Suddenly, Yang Ye took a step forward. She hurriedly grabbed his hand and gazed at Nanli Xian, “Leave! Right now!”

Nanli Xian frowned slightly, “What’s the meaning of this?”

She forcefully held onto Yang Ye’s hand and spoke solemnly, “Nanli Xian, if you don’t want to die, then fuck off right now!”

She was on the verge of losing control of Yang Ye!

A cold glow flashed through Nanli Xian’s eyes, “Bai Zhixian, you…”

“Fuck off!” She suddenly howled with fury, “It’s for your own good!”

Nanli Xian’s face was terribly gloomy, “I refuse. Let me see if you dare to do anything to me!”
