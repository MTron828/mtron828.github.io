Chapter 1329 – Big Sister! Save Me!

5 Voider Realm demon beasts, and the terrifying Demon Empress and that young woman.

How do I overcome this situation? Yang Ye’s thoughts were flashing swiftly. At this moment, he had a very clear understanding of the situation that he was in, and he was absolutely incapable of defeating him. Not to mention that they had 7 Voiders, just the Demon Empress wasn’t someone he could fight right now. Her strength really far surpassed his own. That was something he had no doubt about.

Besides raising his sword intent to the Quasi Returnal Rank or igniting his soul again, perhaps he would have a chance to fight them. But the problem was that even if he did that, it would be impossible for him to kill the Demon Empress and the young woman. Moreover, once he suffered backlash from it, he would definitely die.

He would still be unable to avoid death even if he made his sword intent or cultivation rise a level!

Since he couldn’t fight them, he had no choice but to flee!

But the problem was the Demon Empress’ speed was faster than his!

What should I do? Yang Ye’s brows were pressed tightly together.

The Demon Empress strode step by step towards Yang Ye. Every single step she took caused space to tremble, and an invisible wave of force pressed down upon Yang Ye in succession. The force was heavy and oppressive like when Heaven Pillar Peak collapsed.

The 5 Voiders in the surroundings didn’t stand by idly as well. All of them released their auras in Yang Ye’s direction. Yang Ye’s Rebirth Rank sword intent was pushed back repeatedly before their joint forces. In the end, it could only barely protect him, and it seemed like it would be dispersed very soon.

Suddenly, Yang Ye looked up at the Demon Empress and said, “Do you really intend to fight to the death?”

The Demon Empress spoke indifferently, “Do you even have the ability to take us down with you?”

Yang Ye chuckled. He didn’t speak another word, and the Sword God’s Seal just lit up on his forehead. As soon as the Sword God’s Seal lit up, the Demon Empress’ expression changed. She knew about the Sword God’s Seal. Yang Ye’s sword intent was at the Rebirth Rank now, and it wasn’t really a threat to her. But if Yang Ye’s sword intent rose a level higher....

If his sword intent rose a level higher, then even she would have to take it seriously.

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings and said, “I know that even if my sword intent rises to a level above, it’ll still be difficult for me to kill you and Mo Xiaoleng. But trust me on this. The other 5 demon beasts here will die.” He wasn’t lying. If his sword intent rose to the Quasi Returnal Rank, then it wouldn’t be difficult for him to annihilate the other demon beasts here.

The Demon Empress fell silent, and she seemed to be giving it consideration.

Yang Ye held his sword tightly while the profound energy within his surged madly.

A long moment silent later, the Demon Empress looked up at Yang Ye and said, “It’s worth paying that price!”

As soon as she finished speaking, she was about to attack. However, Yang Ye attacked first. A terrifying wave of sword intent suddenly surged out from within him, and then it was compressed before erupting forward.

Bang!

A wave of destructive force swept towards the surroundings with Yang Ye at its center. The Voider Realm demon beasts around Yang Ye were blasted around 1km away. As for the Demon Empress, she was pushed around 30m back. But it didn’t take long for her to stretch her right hand forward and clench it.

Bang!

The terrifying wave of energy created by Yang Ye’s sword intent which was brought to the brink had been instantly dispersed. The surroundings immediately returned to calm. However, the space in the surroundings was covered in cracks that seemed like spiderwebs.

At this moment, Yang Ye wasn’t where he was standing anymore.

The Demon Empress’ eyes narrowed slightly, and then she took a step forward and instantly vanished on the spot. At the same time, her voice resounded here, “Pursue him!”

As soon as her voice finished resounding through the air, Mo Xiaoleng and the other Voiders vanished on the spot.

A few thousand kilometers away, Yang Ye hurriedly withdrew some violet crystals and swallowed them before flying forward madly on his sword.

Actually, he was just scaring the Demon Empress just now. He didn’t dare to forcefully raise his sword intent to the Quasi Returnal Rank again, of course. What a joke! It would give him temporary strength, but what about once the duration was up? He would only be able to sit there and wait for death to arrive. It could be said that unless he had no other choice, he wouldn’t do it, nor would he dare to improve his sword intent by force or improve his cultivation by force through igniting his soul!

After all, those methods were used when he was fighting with his life on the line!

However, he hadn’t expected that the Demon Empress was actually determined to kill him, even if she had to sacrifice the lives of the Voider Realm demon beasts there.

Actually, it was very normal. The Demon Empress was no fool. Perhaps she would have to pay a price if she chose to kill Yang Ye now, but it was worth it. Because once Yang Ye was allowed to leave and join forces with the entire Sword Alliance, then killing him wouldn’t be possible by just sacrificing a few Voider Realm demon beasts.

After all, the remaining Voiders of the 3 sects and 3 cities had gone to Dark Hell Continent. Once Yang Ye joined forces with them, then it would be quite difficult for her to kill Yang Ye and destroy the Sword Alliance. But once she killed Yang Ye, she could destroy the Sword Alliance with absolute ease!

At this moment, Yang Ye had raised his speed to its limits. The Void Flash technique combined with Blink allowed him to instantly fly a few thousand kilometers away. Even though it exhausted quite a bit of profound energy, he had no other choice.

Even though he’d raised his speed to its limits, he still wasn’t able to shake the Demon Emperor off his trail. At this moment, he could sense her aura, and it made his face become slightly gloomy. If he let her catch up to him again, then he would probably be unable to escape even if he brought his sword intent to the brink again.

The only reason he’d been able to escape just now was that he’d taken them off guard, and the Demon Empress hadn’t taken any precautions. Yet now, they would definitely take precautions. So, once he allowed them to catch up to him, it would be difficult to redo the same thing and escape. After all, the Demon Empress was clearly not a fool!

A moment of silence ensued before Yang Ye spoke in a low voice, “Zi’er, can you seal off the space she’s traveling through?”

Zi’er pondered deeply for a moment before she said, “She’s very strong and can easily break through my spatial techniques. But I’ll still give it a try!”

As soon as she finished speaking, a ray of violet light flashed. After that, the space behind Yang Ye suddenly started to tremble before starting to compress in layers. At this moment, the space in this area was extremely strange. However, it didn’t take long for a wave of energy to suddenly seep out from that expanse of space, and then it only took an instant for the space there to return to normal.

Zi’er’s voice arose in Yang Ye’s mind, “I can’t! She’s too strong!”

Yang Ye’s face fell. Even Zi’er’s spatial techniques can’t trap her! If this goes on, she’ll catch up to me soon.

Meanwhile, Zi’er suddenly said, “I’ll detonate the space behind you. Perhaps it’ll be able to delay her a little! However, it won’t work for long.”

Yang Ye nodded, “I understand.”

Based on the Demon Empress’ actions, it was clear that she was determined to kill him. So, even fleeing wouldn’t work, and he had to think of something. After pondering deeply for a long time, Yang Ye seemed to have thought of something, and he frowned while a trace of hesitation appeared in his eyes. A long time passed before he took a deep breath and said, “Desperate times require desperate measures. I have no choice but to try! Zi’er, help me slow her down.”

“Alright!” An instant after she spoke, the space behind them collapsed incessantly, and rumbling resounded incessantly from behind them. The following scene was quite shocking. Because they left a trail of collapsed space in their wake. So, a huge stretch of black holes were left behind wherever they’d passed.

However, Yang Ye still had a solemn expression on his face because the Demon Empress’ aura was still there. She was like a ghost that was sticking closely behind him.

Suddenly, Zi’er’s voice resounded, “Watch out!”

Yang Ye looked up and saw a huge palm had suddenly appeared in the sky. It wasn’t descending towards him but an area ahead. But that made the expression on Yang Ye’s face become even more unsightly. Because based on his current speed, the moment it descended to the ground was the exact same time that he would pass through that area.

He could go around it or stop for a moment, of course. But if he did that, then the Demon Empress would instantly appear before him.

Yang Ye didn’t hesitate to press his sword against his forehead before stomping his right foot down, and then his figure transformed into a ray of light that shot forward.

Hiss!

The ray of light pierced through the palm and vanished into the sky.

Yang Ye had just vanished when the Demon Empress appeared where he’d been standing, and then Mo Xiaoleng and the other 5 Voiders appeared right after her.

The Demon Empress looked ahead with an icy cold gaze in her eyes, “If we don’t kill him this time, then we’ll have endless troubles in the future!” As soon as she finished speaking, she took a step forward and vanished on the spot.

Actually, she understood now why the Nie Clan was so desperate to kill Yang Ye. Yang Ye was a truly terrifying genius. Not to mention in the future, he was extremely dangerous even now. If the demon race wanted to reign supreme over Dark Hell Continent, then Yang Ye had to be eliminated. Otherwise, even if the demon race could annihilate the human race now, it would definitely regain its past glory in the future!

Mo Xiaoleng and the others immediately followed after her.

Around 15 minutes later, Yang Ye had fled out of the Veiled Region and arrived on Dark Hell Continent, and then he continued fleeing.

Mo Xiaoleng asked while following behind the Demon Empress, “Is he returning to the Sword Alliance?”

The Demon Empress’ face was icy cold, and she’d lost the smile and calmness she usually had, “No matter where he goes, he must die today! No one can save him!”

In next to no time, the Demon Empress’ group vanished on the spot and went off in pursuit of Yang Ye.

Around 5,000km away, Yang Ye’s profound energy was surging madly within him, and it raised his speed to his limits. His profound energy was being burnt up at an insane rate as he wasn’t holding back at all, and he vanished forward as swiftly as he could.

Zi’er asked, “Are you heading back to the Sword Alliance?”

Yang Ye shook his head. Return to the Sword Alliance? The current forces of the Sword Alliance wouldn’t be able to stop the Demon Empress’ group. Because they weren’t mentally prepared at all. If he led the Demon Empress and the others to the Sword Alliance, the Sword Alliance would definitely be caught off guard and suffer heavy losses. Perhaps even Doomsday City would be destroyed. So, returning to the Sword Alliance would only drag it down with him.

Zi’er asked, “Then where are you heading?”

“We’ll be there soon!” As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye shot forward.

Around 15 minutes later, a huge ocean appeared within Yang Ye’s field of vision. Yang Ye transformed into a ray of light that descended to the ground, and then he looked up before instantly heaving a sigh of relief in his heart. There was a woman seated on the huge rock in front of him.

Meanwhile, the Demon Empress’ group appeared not too far behind Yang Ye.

Yang Ye’s eyelids twitched, and he instantly flashed onto the huge rock and grabbed Blind Maiden’s arm, “Big Sister! Save me!”
