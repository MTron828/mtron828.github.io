Chapter 1918 – Go On! Continue!

All of you!

Yang Ye wasn’t intentionally infuriating everyone because he’d gone mad. But as far as he was concerned, the stronger he acted, the better it would be for them.

Those people hiding in the shadows would attack no matter what.

Since that was the case, infuriating or not didn’t make a difference. However, there was a benefit, and it was that it would make them become cautious and fearful. The stronger he acted, the more fearful they would be!

The surroundings suddenly fell silent!

At this moment, all of them were looking at Yang Ye. Because he was much stronger than they’d ever imagined.

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings. When he saw that no one was attacking, he gazed at Nansi Yin, “Let’s go!”

Nansi Yin nodded slightly and walked over to Yang Ye’s side.

They continued towards Northern Sky City. However, they were walking slightly quicker now.

But they hadn’t walked far before they stopped again.

A middle aged man had appeared before them. The middle aged man’s gaze lingered on Nansi Yin’s forehead for a moment, and then he gazed at Yang Ye, “Even though I’m wasting my breath, I still want to say a few words. Based on the natural talent you possess, your future is definitely limitless. So, why fight to the death here and offend countless people?”

Yang Ye smiled, “It must have been difficult for you to attain your current cultivation too. So, why lose your head for a piece of inheritance?”

The man shook his head slightly, “Perhaps my fate will change if I risk my life!”

Yang Ye nodded, “True. So, bring it!”

The middle aged man suddenly looked up at the sky, “Everyone, you can dream about obtaining the Sage’s inheritance while he’s still alive. So, instead of being vigilant against each other and fearing each other, why don’t we join forces for now. We can discuss the owner of the Sage’s inheritance once we’ve dealt with him. What do you think?”

Silence filled the sky.

Meanwhile, the middle aged man was about to continue, but Yang Ye suddenly vanished on the spot. A flaming ray of sword energy flashed, and the space in its wake was incinerated to the point of turning ethereal.

The middle aged man’s expression changed when he saw Yang Ye attack abruptly. He’d witnessed Yang Ye’s strength earlier, so he didn’t dare to act carelessly at all. A pitch black shield appeared in his grasp, and a ghastly cold glow flickered on it.

The middle aged man stomped his right foot down, and he shot forward while raising the shield in front of him and slammed it against Yang Ye’s flaming sword energy.

Bang!

Yang Ye’s sword energy was slammed into bits, and the middle aged man’s figure didn’t slow down at all as it slammed down at Yang Ye.

Pressure!

At this moment, Yang Ye felt pressure that was almost upon him, and it felt like a mountain was slamming down towards him.

Yang Ye was mentally prepared. Because the middle aged man had dared to attack even after witnessing his strength, so the middle aged man was definitely not weak.

Yang Ye didn’t let his thoughts run wild. As soon as the middle aged man arrived in front of him, his sword stabbed forward like a venomous snake.

The sword stabbed against the shield!

Boom!

An explosion rumbled through the surroundings. The space around Yang Ye and the middle aged man shook violently, and then both of them were pushed backwards. They were both pushed over 1km away before they finally stopped themselves.

However, as soon as the middle aged man stopped himself, his black shield cracked apart!

Spiritbreaker! It broke the spirit of all things!

The middle aged man’s face fell when he saw his shield crack apart. It was a high-grade Imperial Rank treasure, but it had cracked apart from a single attack!

The middle aged man looked up at Yang Ye, or to be more precise, he was looking at Yang Ye’s sword. Meanwhile, Yang Ye had vanished on the spot, and then a ray of light grew rapidly in the middle aged man’s eyes.

His eyes narrowed slightly while ferocity flickered within them, and then he slowly clenched his fists.

Bang!

A wave of blue aura swept out from him, and then he slammed his fists forward.

Boom!

An explosion resounded. Yang Ye’s sword energy was obliterated by the middle aged man’s punches, but Yang Ye had appeared before the middle aged man. After that, numerous rays of sword energy enveloped the middle aged man.

Bang! Bang! Bang!

The sound of punches and sword howls resounded within the sword energy. Around 10 breaths of time passed before a figure was blasted out from there.

Nansi Yin heaved a sigh of relief when she saw the figure.

Because it was the middle aged man!

Yang Ye didn’t stop after he blasted the middle aged man away, and he shot towards the middle aged man instead. However, a black shadow suddenly flashed down from the sky and forced Yang Ye to a stop.

Once he stopped himself, Yang Ye raised his hand and swung his sword upwards into the air!

Bang!

The black shadow was blasted away.

Meanwhile, a woman in a black dress appeared in the sky. Besides her, there was another young man in a luxurious robe, and a black robed man who was completely concealed beneath his black robe.

The woman glanced at Yang Ye, and then she gazed at the middle aged man down below, “Let’s join forces and kill him first!”

As soon as she finished speaking, a black whip appeared in her grasp, and then it shot through the sky like a bolt of black lightning that was striking Yang Ye.

Yang Ye was about to swing his sword when the whip suddenly grew in size and transformed into a huge black python that was over 1km long. The python opened its mouth in Yang Ye’s direction, and it clearly seemed like it intended to swallow him!

However, Yang Ye didn’t try to dodge, and he just allowed it to descend upon him. But right when it was about to swallow him whole, a strand of flames suddenly emerged from within him.

Bang!

A moment later, the python caught fire, and it was incinerated in an instant!

The woman in a black dress frowned at the sight of this.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye had arrived in front of her. But he hadn’t even come into contact with her when the man in a luxurious robe appeared behind Yang Ye. After that, threads of cold light that was thin as the hair of an ox descended upon Yang Ye like a storm and enveloped him!

“Fuck off!” Yang Ye’s voice resounded from within the cold light, and then a ray of sword energy tore them apart. The sword energy didn’t slow down at all and shot towards the man in a luxurious robe.

Bang!

The man was blasted 3km away. However, at the instant that he’d been pushed back, the woman in front of Yang Ye suddenly soared up into the air, and she formed a strange seal with both hands. In an instant, the space around Yang Ye started trembling.

She suddenly commanded, “Spacerift!”

As soon as she commanded, the space around Yang Ye suddenly split open. In an instant, countless blades of light shot out from the rifts, and they instantly enveloped Yang Ye.

Slash! Slash! Slash! Slash!

The sound of flesh being cut resounded incessantly.

Nansi Yin clenched her fists.

A few breaths of time later, the blades of light gradually vanished. However, the woman in a black dress instantly frowned.

Yang Ye was still alive.

Yang Ye’s clothes had been cut into countless pieces, causing the flesh beneath to be exposed. There were many blood red blade marks throughout his body, but none of them had drawn blood.

Yang Ye had forcefully endured such a lethal attack with just his physical defenses.

The woman in a black dress and the others’ expressions became quite unsightly from the sight of this. They knew Yang Ye’s physical defenses weren’t bad, but they hadn’t expected that to not be the extent of it, and it was extremely terrifying instead!

He could fight and take hits!

Yang Ye put on another new set of clothes, and then he looked up at the woman in a black dress before instantly transforming into a ray of light that shot towards her!

The Sword Domain combined with Split Second!

It was swift to the absolute limit.

However, the woman in a black dress had clearly taken precautions against it as Yang Ye had used it earlier. So, as soon as Yang Ye swung his sword, the space in front of the woman started to condense into layers. At the same time, rays of cold light ceaselessly shot out from the space before her.

Bang!

A loud explosion rumbled through the air!

A pitch black rift appeared in the space before the woman. It was sliced open by Yang Ye’s sword energy. However, she was unharmed as she’d moved over 10km back.

She’d forcefully stopped that lethal attack from Yang Ye!

Yang Ye sized up the woman and said, “Interesting! Go on! Continue!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he raised his hand and swung his sword.

Split Second again!

A ray of light flashed and arrived before her.

The woman’s pupils constricted slightly, and then the space around her started to condense once more.

Two breaths of time later, she appeared over 10km away. As soon as she stopped herself, a wisp of blood seeped out from the corner of her mouth.

Even though she’d defended herself against Yang Ye’s attack, the force of it had still heavily injured her!

A smile curled up on the corners of Yang Ye’s mouth, “Continue!” Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

As he spoke, he was about to attack again, but the woman suddenly said, “Attack together!”

Once she said that, the man in a luxurious robe, the black robed man, and the middle aged man vanished on the spot. All of them charged at Yang Ye.

A one on one battle had transformed into a group siege!

A ferocious smile curled up on the corners of Yang Ye’s mouth when he saw all four of them join forces, and then he stomped his right foot down.

In an instant, the entire sky dimmed down.
