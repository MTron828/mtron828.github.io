Chapter 2604

One his swords had broken!

It was the Sword Precursor!

After being attacked by countless Darkspawn, she finally couldn’t hold on any longer and broke into two!

Yang Ye was shocked and waved his right hand, hurriedly placing her broken halves back into the Primordial Pagoda!

Meanwhile, the Sword Supreme was on the verge of breaking as well!

Yang Ye didn’t hesitate to place her back in the Primordial Pagoda as well!

Only Executor remained!

Once the two swords vanished, the surroundings fell quiet!

Strangely quiet!

Silent mental pressure was the most lethal!

Because you never know when the enemy will attack!

Yang Ye closed his eyes slowly.

Once his injuries were healed, more would immediately appear. Just like that, it was an endless cycle.

Most of the Darkspawn here were at the peak of the Lord Realm.

While they were only at the peak of the Lord Realm, their strength was much, much greater than the Lord Realm experts in the outside world. Perhaps it was due to the environment they grew in!

Yang Ye took a deep breath. He was in a hopeless situation!

He'd tried the Laws of Darkness, he’d tried it from the very beginning. However, even the Laws of Darkness couldn’t help him see the surroundings. It didn’t really help!

The darkness here surpassed the scope of his Laws of Darkness!

Not to mention the Laws of Darkness, even the Sword Domain couldn’t help him see the surroundings clearly.

The matter here was dark, and it was how they were. So, unless he possessed something that surpassed the scope of this world, this place would be pitch black, and nothing would work!

Suddenly, a sharp screech resounded!

Yang Ye’s pupils constricted, and then Executor appeared in his right grasp as he twisted his body and swung his sword!

Hiss!

It sounded like something had been sliced open!

Yang Ye sensed a pool of warm blood!

However, he was blasted away, and a few more deep cuts appeared on his back and chest!

Even he didn’t know when they had appeared!

The Darkspawn here weren’t limited to a single type. There were many, and their attacks were different. Some used pure strength while some were extremely mysterious!

The surroundings fell silent again.

The Darkspawn didn’t dare to act rashly because Yang Ye’s sword was very sharp, and getting hit by it led to either a heavy injury or death!

They planned to gradually exhaust Yang Ye to death!

Yang Ye’s injuries were impossible to fully heal because so long as they healed slightly, the Darkspawn would immediately attack!

Yang Ye emanated sharp sword intent and sword energy as he stood there with his sword in hand.

This time, Yang Ye didn’t stand by idly and wait for death to arrive. Just like before, he chose to take the initiative and attack!

A sword howl resounded abruptly, and then a ray of sword energy flashed. However, it only took a moment for it to be swallowed by the darkness!

The battle in the darkness was still going on!

A long time passed before Yang Ye finally felt extremely exhausted!

There was no concept of time here. He had to main absolute focus at all times, and the Darkspawn in the surroundings seemed simply endless!

Of course, he did gain something, and it was that he’d gained much more experience against their attacks!

His reaction was much, much greater than before.

It could be said that these Darkspawn had forcefully trained his reaction!

In the beginning, he couldn’t react in time and was covered in injuries! Just like that, he gradually grew accustomed to their method of attack! Moreover, his combat instinct had grown more than just a little!

Even though he was still being suppressed by them, it wasn’t as terrible as before!

Just like that, time trickled by!

A long time passed before Yang Ye started to be able to easily deal with them!

As for his attacks, they grew even sharper!

Every swing of his sword would either kill or injure a Darkspawn that approached him!

Under such circumstances, he had to make his sword hit a lethal point with every swing. Otherwise, he would be wasting his energy, and wasting energy at a time like this was very lethal.

Yang Ye walked slowly with his sword in hand. His eyes were closed because his eyes were useless here.

He was relying on his ears and reaction right now!

The surroundings were extremely quiet!

The Darkspawn loved to exert mental pressure on their prey.

Yang Ye walked for around 15 minutes before he suddenly twisted his figure sideways and swung his sword horizontally.

A ray of light flashed!

Hiss!

Bang!

A strand of blood sprayed from the tip of Yang Ye’s sword, and he was pushed 300m back!

Yang Ye stopped himself 300m away, and blood flowed slowly down his sword!

Suddenly, Yang Ye’s pupils constricted, and then he stabbed his sword forward with both hands.

Boom!

Countless strands of sword energy and sword intent swept out like the tide!

The Sword Domain Sphere!

Along with its formation, the sound of something being sliced apart resounded, and it was accompanied by countless shrill cries!

However, blood appeared on Yang Ye as well. Especially his face. There were a few cuts on it now, and it could be said to have completely destroyed his face!

Of course, he wouldn’t care about that at a time like this. His life was most important right now!

Just like that, Yang Ye entered an endless slaughter!

Eternal Kingdom.

Along with the Lu Clan sending Yang Ye to Darkspace, Eternal Kingdom regained its peace. After all, the powers of Eternal Kingdom had been very worried while Yang Ye was still here.

He was an unstable element!

Especially when someone so strong was backing Yang Ye!

It could be said that they didn’t fear Yang Ye, they feared Yang Ye”s backing!

Along with Yang Ye’s disappearance, the Soul Sect entered the West Region again. However, they didn’t plan to spare the Ancient Sword Sect.

So long as the Ancient Sword Sect still existed, then they would always remain a potential problem!

Not just for the Soul Sect but to all the other clans and powers too!

Moreover, Eternal Kingdom needed to have no internal issues when facing the desolate race, and if they didn’t clean up the remnants of the Ancient Sword Sect, then it was obvious how these experts of the Ancient Sword Sect may stab them in the back while they fought the desolate race!

Previously, Yang Ye was here, so they had to give up on attacking the Ancient Sword Sect. At that time, they really didn’t want to offend Yang Ye and the Ancient Sword Sect. But now, Yang Ye was in Darkspace, and it was a place that even a Destiny Realm expert couldn’t rely on themselves to escape!

The War Dimension.

A woman and a robust man stood in the sky above the city!

They looked into the distance as they stood there.

A long time later, an old man flew over through the air and appeared before them.

The old man produced a golden command token!

The Eternal Token!

The old man said, “Lady Liu Yuan, my lord orders you to send five guards to clear out the remnants of the Ancient Sword Sect.”

Liu Yuan glanced at the old man. She didn’t accept it or offer any reply.

The old man frowned slightly, “Lady Liu Yuan, are you planning on refusing your orders?”

Liu Yuan shook her head, “The War Dimension was made for the desolate race, and the generals and guards of the War Dimension will only go against the desolate race and all other invaders. We do not participate in the internal strife of Eternal Kingdom.”

The old man’s eyes narrowed slightly, “So you really intend to refuse your orders?”

She grinned, “Then I shall. So long as I still remain the commander here, my forces will not act against the Ancient Sword Sect. Of course, our lord can remove me from my position!”

The old man glanced coldly at her, “Lady Liu Yuan, our lord will definitely be very disappointed in you. Do you realize that the Ancient Sword Sect is very likely to join forces with the desolate race when we go to war with the desolate race. At that time, countless living beings throughout Eternal Kingdom will perish. Is that something you wish to see happen?”

Liu Yuan chuckled, “Why has the Ancient Sword Sect been pushed to that? Don’t you know the answer? As I said before, so long as I remain the commander, the guard and generals here will not act against the Ancient Sword Sect. Unless they really join forces with the desolate race!”

She walked off once she finished speaking.

Meanwhile, the old man suddenly emanated a powerful aura that enveloped Liu Yuan.

Suddenly, Liu Yuan stopped and gazed at him, “If you remain in War Dimension after three breaths of time pass, I guarantee that you’ll vanish from this world!”

The old man’s face turned quite unsightly, “Liu Yuan, you…”

Suddenly, three figures in violet armor suddenly appeared around the old man, causing his expression to instantly change!

War Guard!

The elite warriors of the War Dimension!

The old man was shocked. He didn’t try to remain stubborn and just left.

Meanwhile, the robust man spoke, “Liu Yuan, what he said actually does make sense!”

Liu Yuan glanced at the robust man, “Demon King, if your demon race plans on helping them, then that’s your problem. But I won’t. I only protect Eternal Kingdom. My subordinate and I will not allow ourselves to become tools for the battles between some people. Besides that, have you forgotten the sword cultivators of the Ancient Sword Sect who’d fought and died for Eternal Kingdom?”

The demon king sighed, “They did make a huge sacrifice all those years ago. Yet now, if the Eternal Sword Master from all those years ago was still alive, I would absolutely not just watch as they acted against the Ancient Sword Sect. However, Yang Ye is their sect master now. He doesn’t belong to Eternal Kingdom, and he’s very close to the desolate race. It’s very likely that he will join forces with the desolate race in the future.”

Liu Yuan closed her eyes slowly, “At that time, I’ll kill him myself. Besides that, don’t forget that he’s in Darkspace now, and his chances of death are very, very high. Once he dies, the Ancient Sword Sect would be without a leader. I’m sorry but I’m unable to do something like trying to annihilate an entire sect.”

She turned around and left!

The demon king stood silently there for a long time, and then a golden command token arrived before him. At the same time, a voice resounded in his mind. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

A short while later, he said, “Give my command! Order Qing Xuan to go with 10 Demon Generals!”
