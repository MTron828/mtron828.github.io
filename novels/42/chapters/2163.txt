Chapter 2164 – I’m Back!

An Nanjing’s master!

So, the middle aged man’s identity was obvious.

Yang Ye had quite an embarrassed expression on his face.

Fight?

He was probably no match for the middle aged man. But refuse to fight? That was such a humiliation!

He was in a dilemma!

But it only took an instant for a firm expression to appear on Yang Ye’s face.

Fight!

Outside the cottage.

Yang Ye and the middle aged man stood far apart from each other. There was around 30m between them.

The middle aged man stretched out a finger and provoked Yang Ye. Yang Ye didn’t hesitate to swing his sword, and sword energy tore through the air and instantly arrived before the middle aged man.

Meanwhile, the middle aged man clenched his fist and slammed it forward!

Bang!

In an instant, Yang Ye’s sword energy exploded apart, and the force of the punch slammed Yang Ye over 10km away. As soon as he stopped himself, the energy within him roiled, and he felt extremely uncomfortable.

Meanwhile, the middle aged man suddenly said, “I used less than 20% of my strength!”

Yang Ye gazed at the middle aged man, and then he suddenly appeared behind the latter. A moment later, a sword stabbed at the middle aged man’s back.

It was absolutely swift to the point even An Nanjing could only see a blurry shadow.

However, Yang Ye’s sword stopped when it was half an inch away from the middle aged man’s back because two fingers had clamped down on it.

Just two fingers!

Yang Ye was shocked. Meanwhile, the middle aged man shook his fingers slightly.

Bang!

Powerful energy slammed Yang Ye over 1km away!

If it was based on the vision of an ordinary person, Yang Ye’s figure would have vanished from their fields of vision upon being blasted so far away.

The middle aged man took a step forward, and he instantly appeared in front of Yang Ye before tapping a finger at Yang Ye. This action caused the space around Yang Ye to turn ethereal, and an extremely terrifying wave of energy enveloped Yang Ye, causing Yang Ye to feel like he couldn’t move at all!

He could only wait for death to arrive!

Yang Ye was shocked and hurriedly activated the Sword Domain, but a fist arrived in front of his face when he’d just activated it.

Yang Ye laughed bitterly. He’d lost!

However, it wasn’t an unjust loss when he was facing the middle aged man before him. Because this middle aged man was the Martial Emperor of the large universe, the Martial God!

He was called the Martial Emperor and the Martial God!

The middle aged man withdrew his fist and said, “To be honest, you really have quite the temper. But being too aggressive makes you an annoyance, and I don’t like people like you. She’s much better. She does as she’s told, and she understands everything she’s told to do!”

Yang Ye asked, “Senior, are you trying to make her a second you?”

“Why not?” The middle aged man continued, “Am I not strong?”

Yang Ye felt speechless.

Meanwhile, the middle aged man added, “However, she won’t become a second me. I’ve almost arrived at the end of my path. Perhaps this path has no end, or perhaps it does have an end. No matter what, she should take her own path.”

He gazed at An Nanjing and continued, “What do you want to become?”

She pondered for a moment in silence and replied, “I’ve never given it that much thought. I just want to continue learning!”

The middle aged man sighed softly, “Do you know that while your natural talent is very monstrous, I was even more brilliant than both of you, all those years ago. However, there’s something I’m inferior in when compared to the two of you. It’s my mental state. Your mental state is more than a level higher than mine. You’re learning merely because you really like it, and not for the sake of becoming invincible or gaining eternal life. That’s something I cannot compete with you on!”

Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly asked, “Then what aspect makes you inferior to me?”

The middle aged man glanced at Yang Ye, “My skin isn’t as thick as yours. You’re really thick-skinned!”

Yang Ye’s face was utterly dark, and he really wanted to hit the middle aged man!

Meanwhile, the middle aged man waved his right hand, and then all three of them vanished on the spot.

A short while later, they arrived at a ruins.

There were broken walls all over the surroundings, and a huge stone tablet stood at the center of the ruins. The stone tablet was around 30m tall, and there was a statue on top of it.

It was the statue of a woman. She had beautiful hair that hung down to her shoulders, and she looked ahead with her right hand behind her back. As for her left hand, she had a strange weapon in it. The weapon was like a spike. It was slightly shorter than an ordinary sword, dark violet in color, sharp, and strangely shaped like the face of a beast.

Yang Ye asked, “What’s that?”

The middle aged man gazed at her weapon and said, “Do you know what that is?”

Yang Ye and An Nanjing shook their heads.

“Netherworld Destiny!” The middle aged man spoke softly, “Legend has it that the Yellow Spring River can illuminate the past, present, and future lives. That weapon is made from the waters of the Yellow Sprint River. Those struck by it will have their past, present, and futures destroyed. They will fall into eternal hell, and there is no escape!”

Yang Ye asked, “Is it better than the Sword Supreme?”

The middle aged man glanced at Yang Ye, “It depends who’s using it. You must realize that regardless of whether it’s a sword or any other weapon, it depends on the user. If they are in your hands, then they would be trash before me.”

Yang Ye felt speechless.

The middle aged man gazed at the statue, “Do you know who’s that?”

An Nanjing shook her head slightly.

The middle aged man said, “The Void Spirit Maiden!”

The Void Spirit Maiden!

Yang Ye was shocked. He’d heard that name in the past. It belonged to an extraordinary genius of legend!

The middle aged man said, “Actually, this place is where the void spirit race resided all those years ago, and it was their base camp. But for some unknown reason, the void spirit race vanished, and the Void Spirit Maiden who was invincible with Netherworld Destiny in her hands perished.”

He gazed at Yang Ye and An Nanjing, and he continued, “I brought both of you here because I wanted to tell you that there’s no strongest existence in this world, and there’s always someone stronger. The path of the strong never ends, and if you take stable steps on this path, you’ll be able to go further.”

Meanwhile, An Nanjing gazed at the Void Spirit Maiden’s statue, “Is she very strong?”

The middle aged man nodded, “Very strong. Perhaps both of you can’t sense it, but even now, I can sense a trace of danger coming from her status. You’re not weak, so surpassing her is only a matter of time for you.”

An Nanjing fell silent.

Yang Ye suddenly asked, “Senior, many have ruled over the large universe through time, but why hasn’t the large universe been destroyed?”

Logically speaking, the large universe couldn’t endure the existence of all of these extraordinary experts, but it was still alive and well. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

The middle aged man gazed at Yang Ye, “Do you know about destiny?”

Yang Ye shook his head.

The middle aged man explained softly, “The stronger you get, and the more worlds you explore, the more respect you’ll feel for the universe. How was the universe formed? How was the first life in this universe formed? Why do the planets in this universe spin in such an orderly manner? Is it the work of nature? Or is it the work of man?”

He fell silent for a moment at this point, “There are many things that we cannot explain, so we could only create something, destiny. Many things in the universe seem to have been arranged by an unseen force. So, who knows if defying the heavens and changing one’s fate is something arranged by the universe as well?”

Yang Ye fell silent.

The Martial Emperor’s thoughts were slightly different to his own. He didn’t care about destiny or the universe. He just cared about staying alive! If he couldn’t even survive, why would he care about the universe? Wasn’t that like worrying for no reason?

The Martial Emperor spoke abruptly, “Come with me!”

Yang Ye and An Nanjing followed the Martial Emperor to an old and damaged hall. As soon as they entered it, Yang Ye felt something strange. It was an extremely strange feeling, but he couldn’t put a finger on it.

“This is a strange place!” The Martial Emperor continued, “There’s a field here, a field which you can cultivate in. I found this place by chance, and then I never left. It can be said to be one of the reasons I was able to grow so quickly all those years ago.”

“Cultivate?” A wisp of surprise flashed through Yang Ye’s eyes, “How?”

A smile curled up on the Martial Emperor’s face, and a strand of spirit energy appeared around him. An instant later, Yang Ye was on the ground.

He’d fallen flat on the ground abruptly, just like that!

At this moment, Yang Ye was quite stunned. Even he didn’t know how he’d gotten on the ground. He wanted to stand up, but he noticed to his shock that he couldn’t move at all!

He couldn’t lift a finger!

Yang Ye gazed at the Martial Emperor, and the latter waved his right hand, causing the surroundings to return to normal. Yang Ye returned to normal as well, but his entire body was extremely uncomfortable.

The middle aged man said, “Someone forcefully absorbed the spatial energy of the universe and condensed it here. It can be said that if the gravity here is released, it’s sufficient to instantly kill ten Sages. Only progenitors can ignore the gravity here. It’s very suitable for cultivating. Of course, it’s only suitable for the two of you. Others are probably unable to get used to it!”

Yang Ye nodded. After the Martial Emperor said that, he’d realized that if he cultivated a sword technique or any other technique here, its effects would be truly terrifying!

Suddenly, Tian Xiu appeared in front of Yang Ye with Snowy in her arms.

Yang Ye gazed at Tian Xiu, “Hmm?”

Tian Xiu spoke softly, “Big Brother, I want to go around with Snowy. Can we?”

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment, and then he gazed at the Martial Emperor. The latter glanced at Snowy and Tian Xiu, and then he said, “They are safe here.”

.

Yang Ye gazed at Tian Xiu and Snowy, “Don’t go too far.”

Tian Xiu and Snowy had been stuck in the Primordial Pagoda, so both the little fellows wanted to come outside and play. Of course, Yang Ye didn’t allow it before this. Because it had been too dangerous. Yet now, the middle aged man was here, so it was impossible for anyone to be able to harm them while they were here.

Once they received Yang Ye’s permission, Snowy flew over to Yang Ye’s shoulder and rubbed her head against his face. After that, she pranced off with Tian Xiu.

The Martial Emperor glanced at Snowy, and then his gaze stopped on Tian Xiu.

A long time passed before he withdrew his gaze, and then he gazed at Yang Ye and An Nanjing, “Let’s begin right now!”

…

Tian Xiu and Snowy pranced off to the statue. Tian Xiu looked up at it, and there was a trace of bewilderment in her eyes, “I’m back…”

Suddenly!

Crack!

A clear and resounded crack arose, and then the status suddenly cracked open.
