Chapter 2643 – The Fifth Sword!

Even though the ethereal figure’s appearance was impossible to discern, it was obvious that the person had an unsightly expression right now!

He'd underestimated Yang Ye’s strength and Yang Ye’s temper!

He felt that the End World had Yang Ye by the throat, but he didn’t know Yang Ye was one who would rather die than bend!

The ethereal figure hesitated for a moment. In the end, he didn’t challenge Yang Ye and just led the way.Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

The End World did have the upper hand, but that was when the entire End World was included. If Yang Ye really stopped at nothing to kill him, then the End World may really be unable to save him. Most importantly, when he calmed down and thought about it, provoking Yang Ye didn’t benefit him at all!

The ethereal figure just gave himself a way out of the situation, and so he didn’t feel as displeased anymore.

Just like that, the ethereal figure led Yang Ye forward, and it didn’t take long for them to arrive at a teleportation formation.

The figure stopped and spoke indifferently, “After you!”

Yang Ye walked into the formation, and then it shook violently before Yang Ye vanished on the spot.

The ethereal figure didn’t enter. He glanced coldly at the teleportation formation, “Enjoy it well!”

He didn’t follow Yang Ye because he was just a guardian of the End Dimension! He turned around and went up into the boundless expanse of space above. However, the space before him suddenly cracked open, and then a fiery red sword stabbed out from there.

It was so fast that the figure couldn’t react to it at all!

Hiss!

His head flew up into the air.

The sword vanished, and so did the spatial rift.

There wasn’t a single bit of movement in the area!

…

Some time later, Yang Ye opened his eyes.

At this moment, he was in a mountain range, an endless mountain range covered in mountains that towered into the clouds.

Something worth mentioning was that the spirit energy here was very abundant, and it was much more abundant than even Eternal Kingdom. However, this world felt ethereal to him, and it felt like how the Origin World was when it was about to be destroyed.

No, it should have been destroyed already! Someone had used formidable abilities and means to forcefully maintain this world!

Suddenly, a woman appeared before Yang Ye. She sized up Yang Ye and said, “You’re that fellow, Yang Ye?”

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings, “Who’s in charge here?”

Her eyes narrowed slightly, “You really are young and arrogant!”

A wave of terrifying pressure slammed down in Yang Ye’s direction.

If it was in the past, the people of this place would have to fear Yang Ye because the Abyss Lord, Qi Bitian, was no ordinary person. Even the End World didn’t dare to rashly offend him.

If Qi Bitian hadn’t tried to destroy the entire Origin World, the End World’s experts would have never gone against her.

But now, they felt Qi Bitian and Tian Xiu would never show themselves again. So, they would naturally not fear Yang Ye anymore.

The woman was a peak Destiny Realm expert, so her aura was like a surging stampede that slammed down at Yang Ye.

Yang Ye glanced coldly at her, and then Executor left its sheath.

The Domain Sword!

Hiss!

A huge gap was cut open in her terrifying aura, and the sword shot straight at her.

The woman’s face instantly turned cold. In the beginning, she’d wanted to go head-on against this attack, but it didn’t take long for her to notice how terrifying it was. So, she immediately changed her mind and dodged it by flashing over 300m away!

Executor flew back into Yang Ye’s grasp, and then he glanced coldly at her, “Why don’t we fight first?”

She was about to speak when she seemed to have sensed something, and then she shot a glance to the right. A moment later, she moved her gaze to Yang Ye, “I’ll remember it for now. Come with me if you wish to save them!”

She turned around and walked off.

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings again and followed her.

The End World!

He would remember this!

Yang Ye followed her to the foot of a mountain. The mountain had been dug out, and there seemed to be a palace there. However, it wasn’t that luxurious and could even be described as quite simple.

It was normal because the people of the End World were peak experts, and experts like them didn’t care for wealth and luxury. As far as they were concerned, the Grand Dao and survival were most important!

There was a long flight of stone stairs within the cave, and at the end of it was a golden chair.

At this moment, a middle aged man was standing by the chair.

It was Mr. Jing!

Mr. Jing sized up Yang Ye and smiled, “Not bad, not bad indeed. You’re at the Destiny Realm. How truly extraordinary. Right, don’t be curious about how I could see through your cultivation. While your dual Domains have fully concealed your aura, it cannot deceive this world. Oh, right. There’s another very important matter. I’m sure you haven’t forgotten, right?”

Yang Ye glanced at him, “Where are my friends?”

Mr. Jing smiled, “Don’t worry, they are still alive.”

Yang Ye said, “Release them!”

Mr. Jing shook his head, “I’m afraid that’s impossible. How would you possibly listen to us if we don’t have them in our possession?”

Yang Ye gazed at Mr. Jing in silence.

Mr. Jing walked down the stone stairway, and he said, “You should have had a look at this place. It’s our final home. Destiny can locate us with ease without this place. You’ve met Destiny before, so you know that we’re all nothing before her. You and those two women destroyed the Origin World that day, and this End World is built with the Origin World at its foundation. Now that the Origin World has been destroyed, this place is about to collapse, and we will be exposed before Destiny soon. What do you think we should do?”

Yang Ye spoke indifferently, “What should you do? Aren’t all of you really formidable? Fight her! Kill her!”

Mr. Jing gazed at Yang Ye for a long time and smiled, “Looks like you’re not being very sensible! If it’s like that, your friends are going to suffer.”

Yang Ye suddenly asked, “Do you have friends and family?”

Mr. Jing smiled, “No. It has been quite difficult to get to where I am. As for those friends and loved ones from all those years ago, all of them are gone. So, you can’t threaten me. Of course, you don’t have the strength to threaten me.”

Yang Ye chuckled, “Go on, tell me what I must do.”

Mr. Jing nodded slightly, “You’re being quite sensible now. It’s very simple. Use the Sprite Progenitor to repair this place. Our ability is limited, so we cannot truly repair this world, but the Sprite Progenitor may be able to accomplish it.”

The people of the End World didn’t dare to take Snowy by force. It wasn’t that they feared Yang Ye, it was that they feared Snowy would summon the sprites of the universe again.

Of course, they didn’t fear those sprites. After all, they were the peak experts of this universe. They feared the woman in white. She was unlike the woman in black as she didn’t kill everyone on sight. Conversely, she usually sided with the good.

If she was made to choose between the End World and Snowy, she would definitely choose Snowy.

Even though she may not necessarily show herself, they didn’t dare to make that bet. Because if she did, they would all be finished.

Yang Ye fell silent for a short while and said, “What if we fail to repair this world?”

Mr. Jing grinned, “You’ll find out.”

Yang Ye nodded and walked out of the cave.

Yang Ye slowly rose up into the air.

Two figures appeared behind Mr. Jing. They were the Divine Abode’s master and Shui Wubian.

The Divine Abode’s master spoke abruptly, “He’s definitely up to something!”

Mr. Jing grinned, “I know!”

Shui Wubian said indifferently, “Let’s see what he has up his sleeve. Now that he doesn’t have the help of Qi Bitian and Tian Xiu, even 100 pieces of trash like him would be nothing for us to fear!”

Mr. Jing shook his head and smiled, “Never underestimate your enemy. If we had underestimated Tian Xiu and Qi Bitian, we would have died that day.”

Shui Wubian glanced at Yang Ye and smiled, “If we really have underestimated him, then I’d like to see who else he can get to help him. Besides Qi Bitian, Tian Xiu, and the Desolate Emperor, practically all the peak experts of the Three Dimensional Universe are here. As for the Dark Lord, Void Lord, and the other lords of a world, they have no reason to take his side.”

Mr. Jing smiled, “Then let’s wait and see!”

They looked up at Yang Ye.

Yang Ye summoned Snowy. She rubbed her head against his cheek, glanced at the surroundings, and then gazed at him.

Yang Ye closed his eyes slowly. He was waiting, waiting for a reply.

Meanwhile, Mr. Jing suddenly said, “What? You’re not going to start?”

Yang Ye ignored Mr. Jing. Suddenly, Mr. Jing’s expression changed, and he looked up at Yang Ye and laughed coldly, “Amazing! Truly amazing! You actually sent people to sneak them out! Unfortunately, you’ve underestimated the Nether Lord.”

As he spoke, he gazed at the Divine Abode’s master, “Please go lend the Nether Lord a hand.”

The Divine Abode’s master nodded slightly and was about to leave. Suddenly, the space before the Divine Abode’s master split open, and then a fiery red sword stabbed out from there.

The Divine Abode’s master’s expression changed drastically!

However, he reacted very quickly. A pitch black pike suddenly appeared in his grasp, and then it stabbed against the sword.

Bang!

An explosion resounded and he was blasted extremely far away!

Mr. Jing looked over, and he saw an old man in a plain robe walking over slowly with a sword in hand.

The Divine Abode’s master gazed at the old man for a long time, and then he suddenly seemed to have thought of something. His pupils constricted as he said, “The fifth sword of the world. You’re Jian Wudi! You’re actually still alive!”
