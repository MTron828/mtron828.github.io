Chapter 1896 – I Accidentally Went Too Fast!

The Floating Path was a difficult one.

The Floating Sect had created it, so it was clearly not that easy to pass through. It tested a person’s mentality, will, and courage.

As soon as Yang Ye stepped foot onto the path, the scene before his eyes instantly changed.

An illusion!

However, such illusions were useless against Yang Ye.

His mentality, will, and courage were extraordinary. Moreover, he was a sword cultivator who possessed the Enlightened Sword Heart.

So, Nansi Yin and the old man were stunned by the scene which followed.

Yang Ye shot through it swiftly. It didn’t even take him nine breaths of time to reach the end.

Silence! Deathly silence!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye returned to them, and he gazed at Nansi Yin, “Sorry, I accidentally went too fast. Right, go on. It’s your turn.”

Nansi Yin clenched her right fist and stared at Yang Ye as if she wanted to see through him.

Yang Ye walked over to her and smiled, “What? You’re going to choose to be my maidservant?”

“Looks like I misjudged you!” Suddenly, the old man said, “May I know why you’ve come to my sect?”

Yang Ye turned to look at the old man and smiled, “I’m here to see two people.”

The old man asked, “You’re looking for someone?”

Yang Ye nodded and said, “Zhao Ling and Jiang Sheng!”

Those were the names of Zhi’er’s parents.

The old man asked, “May I know why you’re looking for them?”

Yang Ye smiled, “Don’t worry, I’m not here to look for trouble with them. I want to meet them for certain reasons. I wonder if you can help me tell them to come meet me?”

The old man glanced at Yang Ye, thought for a moment, and then nodded, “Wait a moment. I’ll get someone to check. I’ll tell them to come meet you if they are in my sect.”

Yang Ye cupped his fist, “Thank you!”

The old man nodded slightly and didn’t say a word.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye gazed at Nansi Yin, “So? Can I take this as an admission of defeat?”

Nansi Yin stared at Yang Ye for a long time before she suddenly cracked a smile, “I didn’t expect myself to misjudge someone. Nine breaths of time. I can’t accomplish that indeed. But do you really want me to be your maidservant?”

Yang Ye asked, “What?”

Nansi Yin smiled, “It’s nothing. I’m just afraid you’ll be found dead on the side of a road!”

Yang Ye’s face gradually fell.

A threat!

Yang Ye shook his head and smiled, “What? Can’t accept your defeat? So you’re trying to threaten me?”

Nansi Yin shook her head, “It’s not a threat. I’m just stating a fact!”

Meanwhile, the old man suddenly said, “She isn’t lying. If you make her your maidservant, I’m afraid you’ll really be killed. It’s just a friendly warning, and I don’t have any other intentions.”

Nansi Yin grinned and remained silent.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye looked her in the eyes and said, “I was actually just joking, and I had no intention to make you my maidservant. But now, I’ve changed my mind. I want you to be my maidservant.”

The smile on her face froze, “Are you sure?”

Yang Ye smiled, “I am! Of course, I can’t do anything if you plan to go back on your promise. After all, I can’t force you!”

She gazed at him for a long time and said, “Alright, I’ll be your maidservant! But trust me, you won’t even survive until tomorrow without begging me to take back what I said.”

Yang Ye smiled, “Then let’s just wait and see!”

She chuckled and withdrew a rock that flickered with green light, and then she spoke softly to it, “Someone has made me his maidservant. I’m on Floating Mountain!”

A breath of time later, a voice came from the rock, “I’ll be there in four hours!”

Nansi Yin put the rock away and gazed at Yang Ye, “Four hours. You may be able to escape if you flee now!”

Yang Ye suddenly said, “I’m thirsty, I want some tea!”

Nansi Yin’s eyes narrowed slightly while the intent to kill flickered within them.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye smiled, “What? Can’t accept your defeat?”

Nansi Yin gazed at him for a long time, and then she cracked a smile, “Of course not!” She vanished on the spot once she finished speaking.

Two breaths of time later, a cup of tea appeared before Yang Ye.

However, Yang Ye ignored the tea and gazed at the old man. A middle aged man had appeared beside the old man.

The middle aged man bowed slightly to the old man, “Elder, they’re not in the sect for now. However, I’ve given the order for them to return as soon as possible.”

The old man gazed at Yang Ye, and Yang Ye grinned, “I can wait!”

The old man said, “You really don’t seem like you’re here to look for trouble with them.”

Yang Ye replied, “Of course not!”

The old man nodded and fell silent.

Around ten minutes later, two rays of light appeared in the sky, and they descended here.

The light dispersed to reveal a young man and woman. They seemed to be around Yang Ye’s age. They bowed to the middle aged man beside the old man, and the man said, “Manager Mo, may I know why you’re looking for us?” Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

The middle aged man gazed at the old man, and the old man gazed at Yang Ye.

Yang Ye walked over to them and asked, “Do you have a daughter called Zhi’er?”

A wisp of astonishment flashed through their eyes when they heard Yang Ye, and the man asked, “How do you know?”

Yang Ye waved his hand and the young girl appeared here.

She glanced at the man and woman, and she was slightly timid.

They gazed at Zhi’er as well, and the man sized her up before saying, “You… you’re Zhi’er?”

She nodded lightly in response.

The man said, “You’ve grown so big.”

She glanced at the man and woman, and she hesitated to speak.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly asked, “She’s your daughter?”

The man and woman exchanged glances. In the end, the man hesitated for a moment and replied, “Sort of!”

Yang Ye frowned, “What do you mean?!”

The man glanced at Yang Ye, “May I know who you are?”

Yang Ye’s face fell, “Answer me!”

At this moment, he was quite unhappy. He naturally didn’t have a good impression of the man and woman who’d abandoned their children, and the way they acted right now made him even more displeased!

The young man was clearly someone with a temper, so his face fell when Yang Ye responded like that, “This is the Floating Sect’s territory, and I’m a core inner court disciple of the Floating Sect. You…”

Suddenly, the old man’s expression changed drastically. He tapped his finger forward, and a ray of cold light flashed.

The surroundings suddenly fell silent.

Meanwhile, a sword was pressed against the young man’s forehead.

Everyone gazed at Yang Ye. Especially the old man. For the very first time, there was a solemn expression in his eyes. Because he’d actually failed to stop Yang Ye’s attack. It didn’t mean he was weaker than Yang Ye, but Yang Ye had been faster!

As for the young man and woman, they were utterly stunned. Especially the young man. He hadn’t expected that the man before him, who seemed to be around his age, actually possessed such terrifying strength!

The woman by Yang Ye’s side glanced at him with a trace of surprise in her eyes. Obviously, she was quite surprised by his strength. However, she was only surprised. She’d seen too many experts in her life.

Meanwhile, the old man suddenly said, “You really concealed your strength well. However, you seem to have forgotten that this is the Floating Sect. Are you here to show off in my sect?”

Yang Ye curled up his finger slightly, and the sword against the young man’s forehead instantly vanished.

Yang Ye gazed at the old man, “Sorry, I’m a little rash.”

Since the old man was helping him, he naturally wouldn’t overstep.

The old man glanced at Yang Ye, “Don’t do it again!” He gazed at the young man and continued, “Answer all his questions!”

The young man hurriedly bowed, “Understood!”

The young man immediately gazed at Yang Ye. This time, he had quite a respectful expression on his face, “Actually… actually, she isn’t our own flesh and blood!”

Zhi’er’s figure stiffened when she heard this, and her eyes were filled with disbelief!

Yang Ye frowned as well. He hadn’t expected that to be the truth. Because the young man didn’t seem like he was lying.

Meanwhile, the young man continued, “It was in the winter. I remember it very well. I heard a loud noise and went out to have a look, and there was a baby in front of me.”

He withdrew a palm-sized jade pendant. It was ink black, and there was an extremely fierce beast on it.

Yang Ye’s frown deepened when he saw the beast. For some reason, it made his heart palpitate slightly!

The young man continued, “She had it with her, and it should be related to her birth.” As soon as he finished speaking, he flicked it over to Yang Ye.

Yang Ye took it and transported it into the Primordial Pagoda.

However, his expression changed drastically just a moment later.

Because the jade pendant had returned to his grasp!

The Primordial Pagoda refused to let it in!

Yang Ye gazed at the jade pendant. What is this? The Primordial Pagoda actually refused to let it enter? Yang Ye was filled with questions.

Meanwhile, Zhi’er suddenly kneeled before the man and woman, “No matter what, thank you for saving my life.”

The man glanced at her, and there was a trace of complicated emotions in his eyes.

Zhi’er stood up and gazed at Yang Ye. He grinned and said, “It’s fine. We’ll search slowly until we succeed. It’s my promise to you. Alright?”

She smiled slightly, “Thank you, Big Brother.”

Yang Ye sent her into the Primordial Pagoda. As for the jade pendant, he put it away. After that, he gazed at the old man. He was about to speak when a terrifying aura descended from the sky.

Meanwhile, Nansi Yin suddenly unfolded her fan, fanned herself lightly, and smiled in Yang Ye’s direction, “Beg me! You’ll beg me!”
