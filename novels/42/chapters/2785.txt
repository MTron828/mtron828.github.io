Chapter 2786 – This is an Ally!

Needless to say, Erya was quite terrifying right now!

He’d experienced the Devil Caracal’s strength himself, and while he’d heavily injured it with a single attack, that attack hadn’t been lethal.

However, Erya had crushed it as soon as they fought!

It couldn’t even fight back!

Erya’s strength was much more terrifying than the last time they met!

Even now, he didn’t dare to say that he could defeat her!

Even though Erya wasn’t the same anymore, Yang Ye was still happy to see her stronger.

Because the stronger she was, the better she would be at keeping herself safe!

Erya looked along his finger, and it made Zuo Mu and the others’ expressions change!

Yang Ye was extremely terrifying already, and if Erya was included, their side’s advantage in numbers would be gone.

But just a moment later, Erya gazed at Yang Ye.

Yang Ye’s eyelids twitched. He didn’t want to fight her now! Because if they did, they would definitely end up dead.

Yang Ye hurriedly pointed at Zuo Mu’s group, and he saw them hurriedly retreat. They created a huge amount of distance between themselves and Yang Ye.

Zuo Mu and the others’ retreat made Erya move her gaze away from them.

Because she didn’t sense a threat from them!

Emperor Li suddenly laughed coldly by Zuo Mu’s side, “Yang Ye, come on! Let us see if you, the new sword cultivator at the Ordinary Sword Realm, or the Evil Beast of the Three Dimensional Universe is more formidable.”

Yang Ye glanced at Emperor Li, “Would you like to see which one of us is stronger?”

Emperor Li’s face instantly turned quite unsightly!

Presently, there may be less than a handful of people in the world who could fight Yang Ye, and they didn’t include him! Yang Ye was one of the strongest experts in the world right now!

Yang Ye didn’t waste his breath on Emperor Li and gazed at Erya. Meanwhile, Erya vanished on the spot.

Yang Ye’s expression changed slightly. He put his sword away and raised his arms!

Even though Erya was strong, he had a chance of breaking through her defenses at his current realm of strength! And he would naturally not harm her.

A petite figure flashed at him!T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Bang!

Yang Ye was instantly blasted far away!

As soon as he stopped himself, the space below and behind him collapsed!

Emperor Li and the others grinned when they witnessed this.

The experts of the Four Dimensional Universe didn’t attack either. It was best to just allow Yang Ye and Erya to fight to the death right now!

Erya suddenly vanished on the spot, and space was torn into bits in her wake!

It was caused by pure physical strength!

Erya’s physical strength may not be at the limits of this world, but there was probably no one else as strong as her right now!

Even Yang Ye was extremely fearful of her physical strength!

This time, Yang Ye didn’t choose to collide with her and hurriedly withdrew the pair of horns!

Bang!

The space in front of Yang Ye collapsed!

At the same time, a figure forcibly stopped before him! The figure was very close!

Erya!

Erya’s appearance hadn’t changed much, but her eyes were terrifyingly scarlet red, and her horns had turned blood red.

They were just like how Yang Ye’s hair was when his slaughter intent erupted forth!

Erya gazed at the horns in Yang Ye’s grasp and seemed quite lost and dazed. But just a moment later, a pained expression appeared on her face.

Yang Ye was about to speak when Erya suddenly roared with fury.

Bang!

A wave of powerful energy instantly blasted Yang Ye away, and Erya didn’t attack again. She just turned around and charged at Zuo Mu’s group!

She had a very ferocious and pained expression on her face, and tears were rolling down from the corners of her eyes.

But Yang Ye wasn’t able to see that.

Emperor Li and the others’ smiles stiffened when they witnessed this.

Zuo Mu suddenly took a step forward while the saber sheath on his waist shook violently. A moment later, he leaped up and swung his saber.

A dazzling ray of saber energy shone like the sun!

Meanwhile, a petite afterimage flashed.

Bang!

The dazzling saber energy was instantly blasted into bits, and then a figure was slammed away.

It was Zuo Mu!

His saber had shattered!

After she instantly blasted Zuo Mu away, Erya suddenly slapped her palms against the ground.

Boom!

A wave of powerful energy surged into the ground, and it instantly turned into a bottomless abyss. As for the Destiny Realm experts in front of her, they were blasted backward repeatedly!

While Erya was extremely strong, the joint forces of a few dozen Destiny Realm experts were able to overcome her strength!

Meanwhile, a sword howl resounded!

Emperor Li and the others were horrified when they heard it. A moment later, the head of a Destiny Realm expert near Emperor Li shot up into the air.

When the others realized what had happened, another Destiny Realm expert’s head had shot up into the air!

They had been able to focus their strength on Yang Ye earlier. So, even though Yang Ye was strong, he couldn’t overcome their joint forces!

But now, he had Erya to keep them busy, and so they couldn’t focus on him. Under such circumstances, the threat Yang Ye posed multiplied by more than 10 times!

Right when Yang Ye was about to attack again, something unexpected occurred. A loud explosion resounded and a white shadow was pushed back repeatedly.

It was Tian Xiu!

Yang Ye looked up, and then an afterimage suddenly appeared before him. Yang Ye twisted his body sideways while swinging his sword horizontally.

At the instant he moved sideways, a pitch black hand appeared before his face, and it slapped at him the moment his sword shot forward.

Bang!

Yang Ye was blasted over 3km back!

The mysterious expert was in front of him!

Suddenly, a ray of dark light slashed at the mysterious expert, and Tian Xiu was behind it!

The mysterious expert glanced at the dark light and waved his right hand.

Bang!

The dark light exploded apart, but an even stronger wave of energy swept over from behind it.

The mysterious expert clenched his right hand, and a huge, ethereal fist appeared behind him!

A moment later, he vanished on the spot, and the huge fist descended.

Tian Xiu seemed completely unafraid as she watched the huge fist descend. She stomped her right foot down and transformed into a ray of dark light that slammed against the huge fist!

Bang!

The huge fist collapsed, but just a moment later, an afterimage appeared before Tian Xiu!

Tian Xiu punched at it!

The mysterious expert swung a punch as well!

A ray of dark light and black light slammed against each other!

Boom!

A moment of silence ensued, and then a deafening explosion rumbled. After that, two figures were pushed back incessantly.

Meanwhile, once he was certain that Tian Xiu wasn’t in danger, Yang Ye charged at Emperor Li and the others!

Because Erya was being besieged by them, but neither Erya or Yang Ye could fight all of them on their own!

Meanwhile, a voice came from afar, “Enter the city!”

As soon as the voice gave the order, the Destiny Realm expert from the Four Dimensional Universe fled into the city. Emperor Li and the others fled to the city as well!

They had planned to annihilate Erya, but after fighting her, they realized that while they had suppressed her, they couldn’t do anything to her!

That petite figure didn’t just possess the strength to obliterate everything before her, her defenses were absolutely abnormal as well!

They couldn’t harm her at all!

Instead of Erya, they would rather face Yang Ye. At the very least, they could kill him, but Erya was impossible to kill!

Now that Erya and Yang Ye had joined forces, they didn’t dare to face them at all!

Yang Ye charged after the fleeing Destiny Realm experts. But a huge barrier of light suddenly appeared on the city walls, and it slammed down upon him!

Yang Ye quickly stopped himself and swung his sword!

A ray of sword energy flashed!

Bang!

The sword energy exploded apart, and Yang Ye was instantly blasted backward repeatedly!

He was pushed around 30km away!

Once he stopped himself, a wisp of blood seeped out from the corners of his mouth, and his right hand was trembling!

Yang Ye gazed at the barrier of light which was retracting back to the city, and there was an extremely solemn expression on his face!

Erya suddenly stopped charging as well, and then she glanced at Yang Ye. Yang Ye’s eyelids twitched, and he hurriedly moved aside! He knew he couldn’t afford to get into battle with her!

Erya was so strong that he couldn’t do anything to stop her!

Erya didn’t attack Yang Ye. She glanced at the mysterious expert who was still in battle with Tian Xiu, and then she vanished on the spot.

The mysterious expert suddenly stopped, and then he turned around and pulled in opposite directions.

Hiss!

The space before him condensed into an ethereal shield. Meanwhile, Erya slammed against it.

Boom!

The shield didn’t break, but the mysterious expert was blasted over 300m back!

Suddenly, a ray of black light flashed.

Bang!

The mysterious expert was blasted away again!

Tian Xiu was about to attack again when she suddenly looked to the side. Erya was charging at her!

Tian Xiu frowned slightly and twisted her right hand slightly. A ray of dazzling dark light slammed against Erya!

She naturally recognized Erya. But at this moment, she didn’t dare to hold back against the force of this attack.

Boom!

The dark light shattered and Tian Xiu was blasted backward repeatedly. Even she couldn’t really endure Erya’s strength!

Erya was about to charge after Tian Xiu.

Tian Xiu frowned slightly. Her right hand had cracked open from the collision!

Yang Ye hurriedly appeared before Erya, “Erya, don’t attack her. You can’t attack her because that’s an ally.”

He pointed at the mysterious expert and did his best to convince her, “Attack that guy! That’s an enemy! Let’s attack him together!”
