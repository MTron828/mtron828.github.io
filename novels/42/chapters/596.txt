Chapter 597 – Herby!

It wasn’t long before Yang Ye got what he wanted. Critical Strike was divided into 3 stages. The first stage instantly doubled the strength of his Sword Intent, the 2nd stage could provide 2 times more strength to his Sword Intent, and the 3rd stage could provide 5 times more strength to it. However, Critical Strike was extremely difficult to cultivate because its requirements were very high.

Firstly, the person attempting to cultivate it had to possess 8th level Sword Intent or above. Secondly, that person must possess the Enlightened Sword Heart. Most importantly, that person’s control of Sword Intent must attain an extremely terrifying state of being able to condense Sword Intent into a single dot before detonating it!

Yang Ye had attained the first two requirements, but he wasn’t able to accomplish the third for now. Because only now did he know that Sword Intent had numerous methods of usage and attack. However, Yang Ye was confident because he possessed 10th level Sword Intent. So, attaining the 1st stage of the Critical Strike technique was only a matter of time!

However, Yang Ye wasn’t really pleasantly surprised by the Critical Strike technique when compared to the other secret technique, Intent Ignition. Because Intent Ignition actually relied on utilizing Sword Intent to improve one’s strength. In other words, Sword Intent was utilized to stimulate one’s potential, and then experience a temporary increase in strength.

The stronger one’s Sword Intent was, the greater the increase in strength would be!

Lan Yun was at the seventh rank of the Exalt Realm. Even though she hadn’t been able to truly advance into the Monarch Realm after utilizing Intent Ignition, she was absolutely at a realm above the ninth rank Exalt Realm. Strictly speaking, it could be considered as the Artificial Monarch Realm!

But Yang Ye possessed 10th level Sword Intent. So if he were to ignite his Sword Intent, then....

Just thinking about it filled Yang Ye with excitement!

However, it had a flaw as well, and it was that the user’s Sword Intent would fall by a level after utilizing it.... This flaw made Yang Ye feel quite depressed because losing a level of Sword Intent was definitely very difficult to accept to any sword cultivator. It was especially so for Yang Ye because he’d relied on great fortuitous encounters to advance his Sword Intent to the 10th level, so one could only wonder how long it would take him to regain his Sword Intent once he lost it!

So, Yang Ye would absolutely not utilize Intent Ignition rashly unless he had no other choice!

A short while later, Yang Ye took a deep breath and gazed at Lan Yun.

“Do it!” Lan Yun closed her eyes slightly and awaited death.

“As you wish!” Yang Ye swung his sword towards her head because he refused to show mercy just because she was a woman!

“Wait!” Right at this moment, Ding Shaoyao and Xiao Yuxi suddenly appeared not too far away, and then Yang Ye stopped his swing.

“What is it?” Yang Ye gazed at Ding Shaoyao as he spoke with a puzzled tone.

She walked over to him and said, “She’s a member of the Hallowed Grounds, so she should be aware of information which we don’t possess. It’s truly a waste to kill her just like that. She’ll be of great use in my hands!”

“You want me to betray the Hallowed Grounds?” Lan Yun laughed coldly.

Ding Shaoyao grinned and said, “After all, your Hallowed Grounds is so formidable, so what would it change even if we do gain information from you? Perhaps we wouldn’t even dare to go against it once we find out about its strength. Moreover, even if we do obtain information about the Hallowed Grounds, could it be that you think our strength is sufficient to attack the Hallowed Grounds? Since it’s like that, providing us information wouldn’t harm the Hallowed Grounds, and you would be able to continue living. So, why not?”

Such a way with words.... Yang Ye really felt admiration for her. Because Ding Shaoyao was actually able to convince someone to be a traitor in such an upright manner. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Lan Yun gazed at Ding Shaoyao for a short while before she said, “Fine, I’ll do it!”

Yang Ye was quite stunned, and then he took a glance at Lan Yun and said, “Herby, you have to watch out. She isn’t weak at all!”

“Herby?” Ding Shaoyao was slightly stunned, and then she gazed at Yang Ye and said, “Are you talking to me?”

“Doesn’t the Shaoyao in your name represent the peony plant?” Yang Ye smiled and said, “Isn’t that a type of herb? We’re friends no matter what, so calling you Miss Ding makes it feel like we aren’t close!” Yang Ye felt that he had to form a good relationship with Ding Shaoyao because she could deal with Xiao Yuxi and Qin Xiyue, and she could even with all sorts of things which couldn’t be resolved by force. In short, forming a good relationship with her was absolutely not a mistake!

Ding Shaoyao glanced at him before she led Lan Yun away.

Corpse Ancestor was quite perceptive, and his figure flashed and vanished on the spot. He’d left Yang Ye and Xiao Yuxi alone.

The violet mink didn’t possess such awareness, and she occupied Yang Ye’s shoulder from the beginning. Moreover, she frequently scratched Yang Ye’s ears with her little claws or rubbed her little head against Yang Ye’s face.

Xiao Yuxi walked over to Yang Ye, and then she flipped her palm. 5 swords appeared in front of Yang Ye as she said, “These are the Dao Artifacts we utilized our connections to gather for you. Use them sparingly!”

Yang Ye grinned as he gazed at the Dao Artifacts because he had 10 now if the 5 from the members of the Hallowed Grounds were included. 10 Dao Artifacts represented executing the Heavenrend Drawing Technique 10 times! However, it really hurt Yang Ye when he thought about how he would destroy a Dao Artifact every single time he executed Heavenrend.

Looks like I have to make a trip to the Hallowed Grounds once I’ve resolved the threat that Lo Jun poses! Yang Ye spoke softly in his heart. He was determined to obtain the ancient sheath’s sword if he could because helping the Sword Spirit was equivalent to helping himself!

“Be careful....” Xiao Yuxi spoke softly, “Even though my father can’t predict your future, he’s able to predict our future. While the workings of the heavens are in a completely chaotic state right now, and it’s impossible to predict the future. He was still able to faintly sense that a huge tribulation awaits us in the future....”

A huge tribulation? Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly while he took a deep breath, and then he took Xiao Yuxi in his arms. He said, “Regardless of whether it’s the Exalted Han Empire, the Hallowed Grounds, or even the defiant profounders who haven’t shown themselves yet, I won’t let anyone harm all of you. Yuxi, I know that both you and Qingshi have been very worried about me lately. Trust me. Such days will come to an end soon.”

Xiao Yuxi nodded lightly, and then she embraced Yang Ye.

After that, Yang Ye started to cultivate behind closed doors, and he concentrated on cultivating and researching the Critical Strike technique. On the other hand, Ancient Domain City had started to speed up the training of the army. At the same time, countless profounders from the southern territory answered the summons of the Grand Qin Empire and rushed incessantly to Ancient Domain City. Most importantly, the entire Talisman Master’s Association had come over as well, and they’d even brought over countless talismans and all sorts of formations!

The morale of the entire city rose greatly from the arrival of the Talisman Master’s Association. Coupled with the news of Yang Ye killing those members of the Hallowed Grounds, the morale of all the forces in Ancient Domain City had risen to a terrifying height.

At this moment, the morale they had made it so that they would probably even dare to try and kill a Monarch Realm expert if needed....

...

The central territory.

A strange scene appeared in the air above the central territory. A veil of red light had appeared in the air above the Exalted Han Empire’s territory. It was a veil of blood....
