Chapter 1702 - Unrivaled Strength!

It’s damaged?

That was what Yang Ye thought at this moment. But it only took an instant for him to reject that thought. What was the wooden sword? How could it possibly get damaged?

Yang Ye walked over to it and looked carefully at it. It didn’t take long for him to notice that he could see fine gold color beneath where the piece of wood had fallen off. It was like gold.

Yang Ye immediately came to an understanding.

The wooden sword wasn’t really wooden, and its true appearance was hidden beneath the wood.

At this moment, he recalled what the patriarch of the Yang Clan, Yang Xiao, had said that day.

The wooden sword was sealed!

In other words, the wood on the wooden sword was a seal, and now that it had lost a piece of the wood, it was definitely because it had absorbed something just now.

So, once he thought up to this point, Yang Ye gazed at the woman, “What’s in here?”

She glanced at him and remained silent.

Her reaction made Yang Ye feel speechless.

Meanwhile, the woman’s gaze descended onto the wooden sword. At the same time, Snowy hurriedly grabbed the wooden sword and seemed like she was trying to convey that the wooden sword belonged to her.

The woman fell silent for a long time before she said, “It has a consciousness of its own, and it’ll choose its own master.” She gazed at Yang Ye and continued, “Don’t let it absorb more of the sword intent here!”

“Sword intent?” Yang Ye frowned slightly, “There’s sword intent here?”

She replied indifferently, “Sense it for yourself.” As soon as she finished speaking, she sat down cross-legged on the spot.

Yang Ye closed his eyes slowly. A long time passed before he opened his eyes again.

Sword intent!

There was sword intent here. Moreover, it was quite strange.

Yang Ye fell silent for a moment before he gazed at the wooden sword and asked, “The sword intent here can help you?”

The wooden sword shook slightly when it heard Yang Ye.

Yang Ye said, “My sword intent can’t help you?”

The wooden sword started shaking.

Yang Ye naturally didn’t understand it, so he immediately gazed at Snowy. The latter blinked and started waving her claws about.

Yang Ye’s expression gradually became unsightly. Because the wooden sword said his sword intent was too weak.

His sword intent was too weak!

His sword intent was comparable to the True Rank! But the wooden sword actually called it weak!

Yang Ye pointed at the woman and asked, “What about her sword intent?”

Snowy glanced at the woman and gazed at the wooden sword. A short while later, she gazed at Yang Ye and started waving her claws again.

Yang Ye’s expression gradually eased up because the wooden sword said that the woman’s sword intent was similarly too weak!

Simply speaking, even True Rank sword intent was too low for it.

Yang Ye thought for a moment and sat cross-legged near the woman. Meanwhile, she opened her eyes and looked at him.

Yang Ye said, “Was it the Sword Immortal who left this sword intent behind?”

She replied, “What do you think?”

Yang Ye said, “The Sword Immortal’s sword intent is above the True Rank?”

She replied, “What do you think?”

Yang Ye said, “Can we talk normally?!”

She replied, “I’ve never intended to talk with you!”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

Suddenly, she asked, “What sword is that?”

Yang Ye shrugged, “I don’t know.”

She frowned slightly. Meanwhile, Yang Ye added, “I didn’t say that because I’m angry. I really don’t know.”

She gazed at him for a long time. When she noticed that he didn’t seem like he was lying, she gazed at the wooden sword in Snowy’s grasp and said, “This is where the Sword Immortal frequently stayed all those years ago. So, his sword intent remains here. It’s sword intent above the True Rank!”

Above the True Rank! Yang Ye slowly closed his eyes and sensed it once again. He could sense the sword intent, but he wasn’t able to sense anything special about it.

She suddenly asked, “It feels like there’s nothing special about it?”

Yang Ye nodded, “Indeed.”

She said, “That’s exactly what’s so special about it. After attaining the True Rank, you’ll notice that it’s like there’s no path ahead.”

Yang Ye asked, “There’s no path ahead?”

She nodded slightly, “I feel like there’s no path ahead. I’m very lost!” She glanced at the surroundings and continued, “There’s sword intent above the True Rank here, so I’ll be able to find my path again here.”

She gazed at Yang Ye and added, “This place is special. If you don’t want trouble, then it’s best to stop that sword from absorbing the sword intent here.”

Yang Ye was about to speak, but she closed her eyes and fell silent.

Yang Ye gazed at Snowy. The latter blinked and gazed at the wooden sword in her claws. Yang Ye had thought that the wooden sword would forcefully absorb the sword energy here, but it didn’t. It just entered the Primordial Pagoda with Snowy.

Yang Ye heaved a sigh of relief. Because if the wooden sword wanted to do as it pleases, then he wouldn’t be able to do anything about it. Fortunately, it gave him face this time.

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings and closed his eyes.

He was sensing the sword intent in the surroundings!

Even he had never encountered sword intent above the True Rank. Now that he had this opportunity, he naturally wouldn’t let it slip by.

Time trickled by.

Two hours later, Yang Ye opened his eyes.

He hadn’t comprehended anything!

Needless to say, it was quite depressing. Yang Ye fell silent for a moment, and then he immersed his consciousness into the Primordial Pagoda.

Yang Ye went to the halberd!

It was the halberd that Yang Xian had left behind upon his death!

When Yang Ye arrived before the halberd, Snowy and the wooden sword were by his side. He gazed at it for a long time before suddenly stretching his hand out and grabbing it. As soon as he took it in his hand, the halberd started trembling violently.

After that, a wave of powerful energy surged into Yang Ye.

Unrivaled Strength and Unrivaled Intent!

They naturally didn’t belong to the halberd, they belonged to its past master.

It was overbearing!

That was Yang Ye’s opinion of it!

The energy and intent slammed down upon him like a mountain. Yang Ye didn’t use sword intent or slaughter intent to resist it, and he just allowed them to press down upon him.

Will!

He was relying on his will to resist it!

The reason he wasn’t using sword intent or slaughter intent was that he knew it was the halberd’s test.

All treasures with a consciousness of its own would choose its master. So long as he endured its test, it would willingly submit to him.

It didn’t take long for the halberd to cease being the only one that was trembling, even Yang Ye’s body had started to tremble. Moreover, the veins on his face and body had bulged up like tiny snakes, and it was extremely frightening. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Snowy gazed anxiously at Yang Ye. However, she didn’t help him this time. Because Yang Ye had told her not to do anything rash and cause trouble.

Time trickled by…

Crack!

Suddenly, a clear and loud crack resounded.

Yang Ye’s arm had cracked open. Threads of blood seeped out incessantly from the cracks. In just a moment, Yang Ye’s entire arm was covered in blood.

Snowy was about to do something, but Yang Ye stopped her.

Just like that, around an hour passed, and the halberd gradually calmed down. However, the Unrivaled Strength and Unrivaled Intent didn’t vanish, and it was still ceaselessly entering Yang Ye’s body!

It was the intent and strength of the halberd’s past owner!

Once intent arrived at a certain level, it wouldn’t vanish unless it was destroyed by external forces, and it was the same for energy. Unrivaled Strength and Unrivaled Intent were the energy and intent of the halberd’s original owner. Of course, regardless of whether it was the Unrivaled Strength or Unrivaled Intent, they had no source of energy to maintain them.

Besides that, it didn’t mean that Yang Ye would possess Unrivaled Strength and Unrivaled Intent upon absorbing it. Of course, there were benefits. Absorbing such energy would greatly strengthen his own strength, slaughter intent, and sword intent.

Once he finished absorbing it, Yang Ye let go of the halberd, and then he started to use his Primordial Violet Energy to repair his body. It didn’t take long for his body to recover completely.

Once he finished recovering, Yang Ye took the halberd in his grasp again, and then a wave of information entered his mind.

Yang Ye closed his eyes. Around a quarter of an hour passed before he opened his eyes, “The Unrivaled Technique!”

The halberd had given him a cultivation technique called the Unrivaled Technique!

Once he gained an understanding of the technique, Yang Ye’s face instantly became solemn, and he felt extremely lucky in his heart. He felt lucky that Yang Xian hadn’t fully grasped the Unrivaled Technique. Or it should be said that Yang Xian’s physique wasn’t suitable to cultivate it!

It had very high requirements of one’s body. But Yang Xian’s physique was weak, so it could be said that he couldn’t truly cultivate the essence of the technique.

Something else worth mentioning was that once one cultivated this technique, one wouldn’t just gain Unrivaled Strength, one would gain Unrivaled Intent as well! It could be said to be a cultivation technique that cultivated intent.

Intent cultivation!

Yang Ye was quite surprised. Because he’d only heard about comprehending intents, and he’d never heard that intents could be cultivated. However, it was real. Of course, he would only know if it worked after he tried to cultivate the technique.

Yang Ye didn’t start cultivating right away. After all, he wasn’t in a safe place right now.

After returning to the outside world, Yang Ye glanced at the woman. She was still meditating.

Yang Ye didn’t say anything and just left.

After bidding farewell to Xiao Jian and Xiao Youshui, Yang Ye left the Grand Immortal Pavilion and found a safe corner in the city before entering the Primordial Pagoda.

In the 3rd level, Yang Ye sat cross-legged on the ground and started comprehending the Unrivaled Technique!

Unrivaled Strength!

At this moment, Yang Ye was quite excited. Yang Xian was weak and sickly, but after he cultivated the Unrivaled Technique, his strength had been capable of suppressing Yang Ye. So, what would happen if Yang Ye cultivated it? If it was combined with the physical strength he already possessed, how strong would he become?

There was the Unrivaled Intent too!

If he grasped Unrivaled Intent, he would possess three types of intents!

Three types of intents combined with Unrivaled Strength and the wooden sword!

At that time, even True Realm experts would be nothing before him!

Yang Ye grew even more excited when he thought up to this point.
