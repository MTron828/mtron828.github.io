Chapter 2779 – Soul Ignition!

He wanted to make the first move!

Needless to say, the others were quite stunned!

Obviously, the strength that the shadow revealed earlier had affected them quite a bit.

Yang Ye glanced at them, “What’s wrong?”

Some of them hesitated to speak.

Yang Ye cracked a smile, “If we don’t take the initiative and wait for them to attack, the outcome will still be the same. The only difference is that we can seize the initiative by attacking now. So, what do you think?”

They exchanged glances and nodded in the end.

Just like that, they walked out of the hall, and then a few dozen powerful auras shot up into the air while led by a ray of sword energy!

In the sky above Universe City, the shadow was looking coldly at the city. There were an entire 16 Pantheras behind him. Besides that, there were some other powerful demon beasts, and there were at least around a dozen of them.

Additionally, there were around 20 pike-wielding experts in golden armor.

These experts in golden armor were exceptionally huge in size, and they were a few times larger than an ordinary human!

The shadow shook his head slightly, “You’re courting death.”

As soon as he said that, he was about to attack, but Yang Ye’s group suddenly stopped.

A moment later, they split up in both directions.

Chen Dao’zi suddenly tossed up a golden flag from the city, and then it transformed into a ray of golden light that dispersed into the surroundings.

Rumble!

In an instant, Universe City shook violently, and then a colossal golden pillar of light surged up from the city.

The aura it emanated was so strong that everyone here was visibly moved by it.

Even Yang Ye was quite surprised. This pillar of light was something that even he may not be able to fully resist!

Of course, its strength was a good thing for his side!

Suddenly, the shadow appeared before the pillar of light, and he slammed his palm against it.

Boom!

The entire pillar of light trembled and was forced to a stop, but it didn’t disperse. However, a wave of powerful energy was ceaselessly rippling out from the shadow’s palm!

The golden pillar of light was cracking at a visible rate!

Yang Ye suddenly said, “It’s time! Attack!”

As soon as he gave the order, Yang Ye charged at a Panthera.

An Nanjing and the others immediately charged forward as well.

The shadow was being kept busy by the formation, so it was undoubtedly the best opportunity for them to attack.

However, the strength of those Pantheras and Demon Guards exceeded Yang Ye’s expectations. Even without the shadow’s help, Yang Ye’s side was still unable to gain the upper hand!

Especially against the Demon Guard. Their strength was much greater than all the experts of Universe City. Universe City had to send around three Destiny Realm experts to deal with any one of them!

Disadvantaged!

Yang Ye and An Nanjing exchanged glances, and then Yang Ye crushed a transmission talisman.

Chen Dao’zi frowned within the city, fell silent for a moment, and then entered a secret chamber. There were numerous blue circles of light there, thousands of them!

Chen Dao’zi formed a strange seal and spoke softly, “Activate!”

In the chamber, the blue circles of light immediately started spinning rapidly.

Rumble!

The entire universe started to tremble, and then numerous huge beams of light surged up into the air from all over the universe. Once they arrived in midair, they tore through space and arrived in the sky above Universe City.

Thousands of beams had converged in the sky above Universe City, and it was a truly magnificent scene.

Meanwhile, the shadow’s aura rose explosively.

Boom!

The golden pillar of light instantly exploded into bits!

The shadow didn’t attack. He just retreated far away with his forces. However, the beams of light were faster than them!

The shadow suddenly vanished on the spot.

Swish!

A huge net of lightning appeared before the beams of light. In an instant, countless bolts of lightning surged down like a thunderstorm toward the beams of light.

Rumble!

Countless beams of light and bolts of lightning exploded throughout the sky above Universe City!

Yang Ye led the others to retreat quickly because the explosions and aftershock of the collision was quite shocking. Even though they didn’t fear them, he didn’t want them to waste their energy on dealing with that!

Just like that, it took almost an hour for all the commotion in the sky to calm down!

The shadow was still there!

Yang Ye walked over to the shadow, and it didn’t take long for him to arrive just 30m away from the latter. He asked, “Are we going to continue?”

The shadow nodded slightly, “Yes!”

He stretched out his right hand and pulled lightly.

Hiss!

Space was torn open, and then a huge bolt of pitch black lightning was pulled out from there!

The shadow pulled the bolt of lightning out and hurled it in Yang Ye’s direction.

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!

Everywhere the bolt of lightning passed, space was instantly obliterated!

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly. He was about to counterattack when an afterimage flashed by!

It was An Nanjing!

She stabbed Dagger-Axe against the lightning!

Boom!

The bolt of lightning shook, but just a moment later, countless arcs of lightning that were thin as hairs shot out from it toward An Nanjing!

Suddenly, a beam of sword energy slashed down.

Rumble!

In an instant, all the arcs of lightning were slashed into bits.

However, numerous bolts of lightning soundlessly appeared before them, and the shadow was behind them!

The expressions of everyone here turned solemn from the sight of this.

The shadow suddenly tapped a finger forward, and it was pointed toward Universe City.

Swish!

In an instant, countless bolts of lightning shot toward the city like descending dragons!

At this moment, the sky above the city had been blotted out by the bolts of black lightning!

In the chamber, Chen Dao’zi had obviously noticed this, and a vicious glow flashed through his eyes, “A formation against a formation? Bring it!”

He swiftly formed a seal with both hands, and then practically all the blue circles of lightning in the chamber started to spin rapidly!

At this moment, all the formations Chen Dao’zi had set up throughout the universe were activated!

The universe was trembling!

A moment later, a huge golden screen of light appeared in the air above the city, and it covered the entire city. Besides that, the space outside the screen cracked open, and then countless beams of golden light flashed out of the spatial rifts.

In an instant, the entire sky was a battlefield for these beams of golden light and the lightning!

Above this battlefield was another battlefield!

Yang Ye and the others were in battle against the shadow’s group!

In just a short while, experts from Universe City had started to fall.

Yang Ye and An Nanjing had joined forces against the shadow, and the shadow actually didn’t fall into a disadvantaged state against their joint forces!

Bang!

Suddenly, Yang Ye and An Nanjing were pushed back repeatedly. A pitch black lightning whip crackled through space as it swept at them!

An Nanjing was just about to attack when Yang Ye stopped her, “Go help the others!”

The forces of Universe City were no match for the Four Dimensional Universe without An Nanjing and him.

The gap in strength between them was quite huge!

An Nanjing pondered deeply for a moment, and then she turned around and vanished into the distance.

At the instant she left, Yang Ye’s figure turned blood red.Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

The Demonic Sword Dao!

He grabbed the hilt of his sword tightly, and when the lightning was just around 3m away from him, he leaped up and drew his sword!

Hiss!

The lightning was instantly sliced into two. But at the same time, a shadow assaulted him.

Burial suddenly shot out from Yang Ye’s waist.

Meanwhile, the shadow stopped, and then his right hand grabbed Burial! However, a ray of sword energy slashed down from above him!

The shadow moved a few centimeters to the side with Burial in his grasp, and he used Burial to stop Yang Ye’s attack.

However, the impact blasted the shadow toward the ground!

At the same time, Yang Ye swung his sword repeatedly.

Explosive Madness Sword Technique!

In an instant, even Yang Ye didn’t know how many times he’d swung his sword!

At the same time, Burial suddenly struggled free of the shadow’s grasp and swept at his head!

The shadow swiftly shot over 1m backward and avoided both of Yang Ye’s swords!

Yang Ye was about to attack again when the shadow suddenly pressed his palms together.

Bang!

The space around Yang Ye exploded apart, and then pitch black bolts of divine lightning enveloped Yang Ye like a huge net. At the same time, a huge bloody mouth was behind the lightning, and the mouth was approaching from right behind the lightning!

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly as he took a step back, and then he stabbed his sword forward with both hands.

The Sword Domain!

After so long, Yang Ye had used the Sword Domain again.

In an instant, the Sword Domain enveloped the divine lightning and the bloody mouth. Besides that, countless rays of sword energy suddenly appeared within the Sword Domain.

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!

Sword energy crisscrossed throughout the Sword Domain. In just a short while, the divine lightning had been completely sliced up by the sword energy. However, a huge, bloody mouth had appeared within the Sword Domain!

The sword energy was actually ineffective against the mouth!

At the same time, the shadow suddenly vanished on the spot.

Yang Ye was in the middle of a pincer attack!

A vicious smile arose on the corners of his mouth. He was just about to risk everything when a white shadow suddenly flashed by.

Bang!

The shadow returned to where he’d been a moment ago!

A moment later, the white shadow appeared before the mouth, and the white shadow flashed with a sword in hand.

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!

Countless injuries appeared on the mouth, and just a short while later, a shrill cry resounded from it as it shot backward in retreat.

A woman in a white dress was standing before Yang Ye!

It was the form of Destiny in the white dress!

She had her left hand behind her back while her sword was in her right, and she gazed coldly at the shadow, “Even if she refuses to stop you, I will!”

She waved her right hand, and an expanse of sword energy rippled out.

Numerous Pantheras instantly lost their heads, and the shadow was even pushed back repeatedly. Besides that, as the woman in white vanished, a few Demon Guards lost their heads as well.

In an instant, the shadow’s side had suffered serious losses!

Suddenly, a voice came from somewhere high above, “Three breaths of time! I’ll kill you if you’re still here then!”

As soon as the voice finished resounding, a sword suddenly appeared above them.

Justice!

The woman in white glanced at Justice, and then she gazed at Yang Ye. She flicked a scroll over to Yang Ye and said, “This is my final gift to you.”

As soon as she finished speaking, her entire body suddenly started to burn!

Soul Ignition!
