Chapter 2533 – A Great Gift!

Elder Xue fell silent when she heard him.

Just as he’d said, the elite disciples of the Ancient Sword Sect couldn’t even stop a single attack of his. Was that normal?

Of course not!

Why was it that way?

It was because their strength wasn’t truly deserved!

It really wasn’t!

Yang Ye said, “Elder Xue, go do what I told you!”

Elder Xue nodded slightly and left.

Outside his abode, Elder Xue looked up at the sky, and she felt that the Ancient Sword Sect may really need a complete change!

In the abode, Yang Ye entered the Primordial Pagoda.

In the pagoda, Yang Ye gathered all the demon beasts at the Ascension Platform, and he felt rather happy when he saw them!

Because they had really been working hard!

Since the beginning, these demons hadn’t become lazy because of the various natural treasures and top-rate spirit energy within the pagoda. Conversely, they worked even harder.

Especially their tempering beneath the pool of lightning. The bodies of these demon beasts were at an extremely terrifying level. It could be said that even he couldn’t pierce their defenses with ease without relying on Executor!

While they were only at the Five World Realm, their bodies were absolutely comparable to Lord Realm demons, and they could even fight Lord Realm demons!

Especially the dragon, it was absolutely not inferior to a Lord Realm expert!

These demon beasts weren’t any weaker to the elders of the Ancient Sword Sect!

If Erya was here, their group would be even more extraordinary!

“Don’t forget the Primordial Pagoda!” Meanwhile, Sword Scroll’s voice resounded abruptly from the side.

Yang Ye gazed at her, and she spoke softly, “The Primordial Pagoda can give them armor made from Primordial Violet Energy, and that Primordial Armor can be said to be boundlessly close to a Divine Treasure! So, their combat strength will be even more terrifying while protected by it!”

Yang Ye waved his right hand, and the Primordial Pagoda appeared before him. After it received Yang Ye’s request, the pagoda shook, and then a ray of violet light enveloped all the demons.

The violet light formed a strong armor around them!

Yang Ye grinned at the sight of this, “Their defenses will absolutely instill despair in their enemies!”

The demon beasts had extremely terrifying physical defenses, and now that they were protected by the armor, it could be said that their defenses were absolutely capable of instilling despair in others!

Yang Ye spent some time with them, and then he went over to the pool of lightning. Over 100 Darkvoid Divine Lightning were flashing through the pool, and the powerful might of lightning in the pool was absolutely suffocating!

In the Primordial Pagoda, there were only two who could get close to the actual pool.

Snowy and Lei Lin!

Lei Lin was a Sprite of Lightning, so she was close to the Darkvoid Divine Lightning, and the pool of lightning didn’t reject her as well. So, she frequently went into the pool to play!

And every round of fun would be accompanied by an improvement to her strength!

Many sprites from the large universe were here in the Primordial Pagoda, and Yang Ye didn’t try to manage them after they arrived in here. He didn’t need to anyway. It was because they wouldn’t harm this world.

These sprites were scattered all over the Primordial Pagoda, and their existence made the world here even more perfect.

Meanwhile, a small head suddenly emerged from the pool of lightning. It was Lei Lin.

She grinned when she saw Yang Ye and leaped down.

She was still so small!

Yang Ye rubbed her head, “Did you have fun?”

Lei Lin nodded and pointed at the pool of lightning, “Big Sis gave me tasty stuff!”

As she spoke, she waved her little hand, and a ball of lightning appeared before Yang Ye.

Sword Scroll spoke softly, “Lightning Essence!”

“Lightning Essence?” Yang Ye gazed at Sword Scroll, and the latter spoke softly, “A form of pure energy that’s very beneficial to Lei Lin.”

Yang Ye nodded, and then he looked up at the pool of lightning. Obviously, it had a spirit of its own.T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Yang Ye didn’t try to speak to it. He was already very satisfied with how things were now. It was willing to help him and the demon beasts temper their bodies, and that was enough. As for making it help him, he wasn’t Snowy!

In the clouds, Yang Ye looked down at the world below, and he could see the entire Sword Sect!

There was no fighting or scheming here. Everything lived in harmony and equality!

This was the place he wanted to protect!

Around two hours later, Yang Ye left the pagoda.

Elder Xue’s voice came from outside the above, “I need a word, Sect Master!”

Yang Ye nodded slightly, “Come in!”

Once she entered, she glanced at Yang Ye and said, “We’ve located an outpost of the Soul Sect. It may be protected by a Lord Realm expert.”

Yang Ye asked, “What about the other thing I asked?”

She looked to the side, “Come in!”

Nine people walked into the abode!

Seven of them were at the Five World Realm while the other two were at the Four World Realm!

They bowed slightly to Yang Ye, “Sect Master!”

Elder Xue said, “Besides Feng Han, all of them are elite disciples.”

“Feng Han?” Yang Ye gazed at them.

Meanwhile, a young man stepped forward, “Sect Master!”

Yang Ye sized up Feng Han, and his aura wasn’t any weaker to the elite disciples!

As if she knew what Yang Ye was thinking, Elder Xue explained, “He’s a top disciple among the inner court disciples, and he only isn’t an elite disciple because he doesn’t want to be one.”

He didn’t want to be an elite disciple!

Yang Ye gazed at Feng Han, “Why?”

Feng Han explained, “I’ve been in the inner court for a long time, and I have some friends I don’t wish to leave. Moreover, regardless of whether I’m an elite disciple or inner court disciple, I’m still a disciple of the Ancient Sword Sect! It makes no difference!”

Yang Ye grinned, “Well said!”

Yang Ye glanced at the others and continued, “Elite disciples and inner court disciples are no difference in essence. While there is a difference in status, I hope there is no difference in your hearts. Do not think you’re better than someone else because you’re an elite disciple or inner court disciple. Alright, I’ll stop here. Elder Xue should have told you about our objective, right?”

They nodded.

Yang Ye said, “I won’t allow any experts of the sect to follow us. We’ll be relying on our own ability to return alive, and if we fail, then we deserve death! Let’s go!”

Yang Ye led them out of the above. He suddenly stopped at the entrance and gazed at Elder Xue, “Don’t send people with us. Elder Xue, you must get my third request done well. Because I think they may attack our sect at any moment.”

Elder Xue was quite hesitant!

Yang Ye smiled, “They’re all elite or inner court disciples. If they still need to grow under your wings, then they are just trash!”

Once he finished speaking, Yang Ye led the others away and vanished into the sky.

Elder Xue suddenly started smiling once Yang Ye left.

In the clouds, ten rays of light shot through the air and left long marks in the air.

Yang Ye was naturally leading the group!

Their destination was an ancient city known as Hill City. There were a few small clans in there, and they were subordinate clans of the Ancient Sword Sect. Though no one knew if they still were!

Once Yang Ye and the others left, the Ancient Sword Sect entered into high alert, and it even issued an emergency order for all its disciples to return to the sect!

Such a situation could only be described as an emergency!

All the disciples who received the order would rush back as soon as possible, even if they were in the War Dimension!

Along with this string of actions taken by the Ancient Sword Sect, the Eternal Kingdom was peaceful no more.

Around an hour later, Yang Ye’s group arrived at Hill City.

However, the entire city was empty when they arrived!

It was empty!

Yang Ye and the others’ faces turned gloomy when they witnessed this from outside the city.

They wondered if the enemy knew of their arrival and had retreated in advance!

“I’m afraid there’s an ambush in there!” Meanwhile, a sword cultivator by Yang Ye’s side spoke abruptly. His name was Qing Yue, and he was one of the strongest among the elite disciples!

Yang Ye glanced at the empty city and said, “Stay here, I’ll go have a look!”

Qing Yue hurriedly said, “Sect Master, I’m afraid that’s inadvisable. I-If you insist on going in, then let’s go together!”

The others nodded to display they were willing to head inside together!

Yang Ye smiled, “It’s alright, just wait here for me.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he vanished on the spot.

Qing Yue and the others didn’t stay on the spot and hurried over.

Yang Ye arrived at the center of the city and scanned the surroundings with his divine sense. A short while later, he retracted it. There really wasn’t anyone here!

But Yang Ye suddenly started smiling, “Weren’t you waiting for me to come inside? I’m here, so you can show yourselves!”

Qing Yue and the others instantly became fully vigilant when they heard him!

“Haha!” Strange laughter suddenly resounded, and then the city shook. A short while later, a huge black cloud appeared above the city and enveloped it.

Countless horrifying faces could be faintly seen throughout the cloud.

Moreover, the entire city was filled with gloomy gusts of wind that were bone-piercingly cold!

Qing Yue and the others hurriedly released their sword intent to resist the wind!

Meanwhile, a hoarse voice came from the sky, “Sect Master Ye, we knew you were coming, so we prepared a great gift for you. We hope it’ll please you!”

Yang Ye closed his eyes slowly.

Only the others behind him and Elder Xue knew that he would be coming here!
