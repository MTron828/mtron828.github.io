Chapter 1721 - I Am Bullying You!

Lu Clan’s patriarch, come chat with me!

Yang Ye’s voice reverberated like a thunderclap through the city.

At this moment, everyone in the city was shocked, and the entire Lu Clan was alarmed!

Someone was provoking the Lu Clan!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye had entered Skyfire City.

Suddenly, a powerful aura converged in the sky, and then it locked onto Yang Ye.

Yang Ye stopped and looked up at it. It didn’t take long for a middle aged man to appear at the center of it. Based on the man’s outward appearance, he was around the age of 30, and he wore a luxurious robe and seemed imposing.

Yang Ye asked, “The Lu Clan’s patriarch?”

A wisp of ridicule curled up on the corners of the man’s mouth, “Do you think my Lu Clan’s patriarch is someone you can see just because you want to? Not to mention you, even the Yang Clan’s successor has no right to meet my Lu Clan’s patriarch.”

Yang Ye asked, “Who are you? Can you represent the Lu Clan?”

The middle aged man said, “I’m the Lu Clan’s guardian, Lu Nanfeng! Yang Ye, since you came to my Lu Clan and killed our True Realm experts, I’ll take your head, and then I’ll hang your corpse outside Skyfire City. I’ll allow the world to understand that my Lu Clan isn’t an existence that just anyone can offend!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he tapped his finger in Yang Ye’s direction.

The aura around him swept out like a storm. In an instant, the space in a huge area warped and transformed into a vortex. At the same time, a strand of mysterious energy flashed out from the vortex!

Spatial Energy!

Yang Ye took a step forward, and then a gap was torn open in the space before him. A moment later, the mysterious energy in the sky vanished.

Lu Nanfeng’s face was unsightly when he witnessed this. The experts of the Lu Clan had told him to be careful of Yang Ye, but he hadn’t taken them seriously. He felt that no matter how strong Yang Ye was, Yang Ye couldn’t be that strong.

Yet now, when he saw this scene before him, he knew that Yang Ye wasn’t just strong now!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly started walking slowly in Lu Nanfeng’s direction, “Do you know Yang Gewu?”

Lu Nanfeng looked Yang Ye in the eyes, “What are you trying to say?”

Yang Ye shrugged, “He’s dead!”

Lu Nanfeng’s eyelids twitched. Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly smiled, “Relax, it wasn’t me.”

Lu Nanfeng’s face became slightly unsightly upon hearing this. He’s making a fool of me!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye walked forward r to almost 300m away from Lu Nanfeng, and then he stopped and said, “Actually, I intend to use reason here today.”

Reason!

The expressions of all the spectators in the city became quite strange upon hearing this.

Because no matter how they looked at it, Yang Ye didn’t seem like he was here to use reason when dealing with their clan!

Lu Nanfeng laughed coldly, “Reason? Yang Ye, are you joking?”

Yang Ye replied, “I really am here to reason with your clan. Unfortunately, your clan doesn’t seem willing!”

Lu Nanfeng spoke coldly, “Yang Ye, you killed my clan’s successor. But my clan didn’t intend to seek revenge. However, you came here and successively killed True Realm experts of my clan. Yang Ye, do you think my Lu Clan is easy to bully?”

Yang Ye looked Lu Nanfeng in the eyes and replied, “Your Lu Clan acted against me from the shadows. Do you think I’m easy to bully?”

A wisp of ferocity curled up on the corners of Lu Nanfeng’s mouth, “We do! So?”

Suddenly, his expression changed drastically, and then he vanished on the spot. Even though he’d vanished on the spot, his hand hadn’t followed him. Meanwhile, Lu Nanfeng had just stopped 300m away, and he hadn’t even let out a sigh of relief when his eyes opened wide. His eyes were filled with disbelief and terror.

Yang Ye was still on the spot.

Many in the city didn’t understand why Lu Nanfeng had such an expression on his face, but it didn’t take long for them to come to an understanding. A small hole had suddenly appeared on his forehead, and it didn’t take long for blood to seep out from the hole. In an instant, his entire face was covered in blood!

Everyone here was stunned!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly appeared before Lu Nanfeng and said, “Am I nice to bully?”

Lu Nanfeng stared at Yang Ye, and the color in his eyes gradually vanished. In next to no time, his eyes had dimmed completely.

Was it an instant kill?

No, not really!

Because Yang Ye had used two attacks!

When he launched the first strike, he was very well aware that it wouldn’t be able to kill Lu Nanfeng. So, he was observing which direction Lu Nanfeng was dodging. Sure enough, Lu Nanfeng dodged, and he’d noticed the exact trajectory. So, he’d immediately launched a second attack!

This attack took Lu Nanfeng by surprise, and because he’d anticipated Lu Nanfeng’s movements, so Lu Nanfeng wasn’t able to avoid it or take precautions against it before being killed!

After he killed Lu Nanfeng, Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings and said, “Lu Clan, I’m not here to kill, I’m here to reason with you. However, it’s obvious that you have no intention to reason with me. Since you don’t, then let’s talk with our fists!”

He paused for a moment at this point and continued, “The Lu Clan is one of the eight top clans just like the Yang Clan, so I presume you definitely have numerous outstanding geniuses. I, Yang Ye, am no expert, and I would like to seek guidance from the outstanding geniuses of the Lu Clan. You just have to be 30 and below, and there’s no limit to the number of challengers. You can even form groups to fight me!”

Silent! Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

The entire city fell silent.

Yang Ye was actually challenging all the geniuses of the Lu Clan!

If it was a while ago, some would definitely call him arrogant. Yet now, would anyone do that? Yang Ye was clearly confident in his ability!

Of course, the comparatively intelligent would notice that Yang Ye’s true motive wasn’t to challenge the Lu Clan’s geniuses, and he was taking a step back so he could advance further.

Yang Ye wasn’t choosing to challenge the entire Lu Clan, he was only challenging the Lu Clan’s geniuses that were below the age of 30. If no one from the Lu Clan stepped forward, the entire medium universe would ridicule the younger generation of the Lu Clan as good-for-nothing cowards, and if the Lu Clan sent someone from the older generation to deal with Yang Ye, it would be an even greater humiliation.

After all, Yang Ye was only at the Zenith Realm!

If the Lu Clan sent someone from the older generation when facing a challenge issued by a Zenith Realm cultivator, then wouldn’t that represent that there was no one capable in the Lu Clan’s younger generation?

Gang up on Yang Ye?

That was even more impossible.

If the Lu Clan actually ganged up on a Zenith Realm cultivator that challenged them, then they would be an absolute joke!

In short, Yang Ye’s challenge caused the Lu Clan to fall into a dilemma.

Skyfire City fell silent again.

No one answered him.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye added, “As one of the eight top clans, the Lu Clan surely has some monstrous geniuses, right? Don’t worry, I’ll show restraint, and I won’t kill them. As I’ve said, I’m here to reason with you, I’m here to win you over with virtue!”

With virtue!

The lips of many couldn’t help but twitch when they heard Yang Ye. At this moment, many wanted to smack Yang Ye on the face with their shoes!

Does he have no shame?

Yang Ye was clearly intending to act completely shamelessly!

He’d killed so many members of the Lu Clan, yet he actually said that he was here to reason with the Lu Clan! If that was considered as reasoning with someone, then they had to admit that it was a very special method!

Actually, Yang Ye’s way of thinking was very simple. It was absolutely impossible for him to bully the entire Lu Clan. If the Lu Clan swarmed him, then he would have no other choice but to flee. Since he couldn’t bully the entire Lu Clan, then he intended to bully the young of the Lu Clan!

He didn’t dare to speak about allowing the older generation to form groups to fight him, but if it was the younger generation, then he didn’t feel any pressure when facing them.

In any case, even if he lost, it wouldn’t be a humiliation for him. After all, he’d challenged their entire clan on his own!

It was still silent, and the Lu Clan didn’t respond to him!

Make their younger generation fight Yang Ye in single combat?

Even though the Lu Clan had some geniuses, could they resist a single strike from Yang Ye? The Lu Clan’s guardian was just killed with two attacks!

Could anyone in the Lu Clan be a match for Yang Ye?

Yang Ye was about to speak when a young man suddenly appeared not too far away from him.

As soon as the young man appeared there, a voice resounded from the sky, “Lu Chaoyun, go back!”

The young man, Lu Chaoyun, glanced at the sky and said, “Elder, it isn’t humiliating for our younger generation to be no match for Yang Ye, it is humiliating if our younger generation acts like cowards and doesn’t dare to accept his challenge.”

The person who spoke earlier remained silent.

Lu Chaoyun gazed at Yang Ye, “Yang Ye, I don’t know about the enmity between you and my clan. All I want to tell you is that perhaps our younger generation is inferior to you, but my Lu Clan has no cowards!”

As he spoke, he vanished on the spot, and he was in front of Yang Ye when he appeared again.

A spear had appeared in his grasp, and he held it tightly in his grasp as he stabbed it at Yang Ye. The spear shot forward swiftly like a flash of lightning, and the force it carried was so powerful that it cracked open the space around Yang Ye.

Yang Ye’s face remained calm. When the spear arrived just over a dozen centimeters away from Yang Ye’s forehead, the tip of a sword suddenly struck the tip of the spear.

The spear shook violently, and then Yang Ye’s sword sliced the spear into two. A moment later, Yang Ye’s sword was pressed against Lu Chaoyun’s forehead.

He’d lost!

He’d lost in just a single clash!

Lu Chaoyun stared at Yang Ye. Besides shock, there was even more bitterness in his eyes. He knew he was no match for Yang Ye before he’d even attacked, but he hadn’t expected himself to be unable to even resist just one attack!

Not even one attack!

Yang Ye was in the same realm of cultivation as well!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly withdrew his sword and looked up at the sky, “Next.”

The sky was perfectly silent.

Yang Ye added, “As I’ve said, the entire younger generation of the Lu Clan can join forces against me!”

He still received no response!

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings, and then a wisp of ferocity flashed through his eyes, “What? A dignified member of the eight top clans, the Lu Clan, has no one with balls throughout its younger generation?”

Lu Chaoyun suddenly said, “Yang Ye, your strength far surpasses the younger generation of my Lu Clan, so why be so overbearing and bully us?”

“Bully you?” Yang Ye gazed at Lu Chaoyun and said, “You’re right! I am bullying you!”

Bullying!

Yang Ye was bullying them. The Lu Clan said that he was easy to bully, so now he was bullying the Lu Clan. He wanted to see who was easier to bully!

Lu Chaoyun was about to say something when Yang Ye suddenly added, “Fine. I’ll use just one hand. I’ll use just one hand against the entire younger generation of the Lu Clan. Alright?”

One hand!
