Chapter 2624

At this moment, Gu Jiantian’s desire to kill was at his limits. Because if Snowy continued, the entire Origin World would be destroyed.

There were too many sprites out there!

The Origin World was on the verge of failing to stop them from coming in!

The only way now was to make Snowy stop!

Snowy gazed coldly at Gu Jiantian while countless sprites gathered behind her!

Gu Jiantian had a ferocious expression on his face. A moment later, two swords behind him shot up into the air and stabbed at Snowy.

Yang Ye and An Nanjing were about to do something about the swords, but Snowy raised her paw first!

A moment later, countless strands of energy rippled out from her paw!

Gu Jiantian’s swords stopped before Snowy.

Moreover, for some reason, the powerful sword intent and energy around them vanished without a trace. A moment later, the swords descended firmly before Snowy!

Gu Jiantian’s eyes opened wide, and they were filled with disbelief!

The connection between and the swords had actually been severed!

The Sprite Progenitor!

At this moment, he wasn’t facing a pet, he was facing a true Sprite Progenitor!

The swords had spirits of their own, and they had been instantly subdued by Snowy.

The Sprite Progenitor was extremely deterring and attractive so such things with a spirit of their own!

Snowy put the swords away, looked up at Gu Jiantian, and then raised her paw again.

Bang!

A wave of energy surged at him like an erupting volcano!

Gu Jiantian’s expression changed drastically. He tapped his foot down and moved 3km back. At the same time, a wave of sword energy flashed through the bridge!

Bang!

A loud explosion resounded on the bridge, and a terrifying wave of energy rippled out through the bridge!

Suddenly, Snowy inhaled, and the terrifying wave of energy was absorbed into her!

Gu Jiantian’s face was unprecedentedly solemn!

Perhaps a Sprite Progenitor’s combat strength wasn’t exceptionally terrifying, but her abilities in other aspects were absolutely terrifying. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

He knew that the situation had just grown worse!

Suddenly, Snowy gazed at Yang Ye, and she rubbed her head lightly against him. After that, she glanced at the surroundings, raised her paws, and inhaled lightly.

Nothing happened!

But it didn’t take long for Gu Jiantian’s expression to change drastically, “How dare you! You…”

Spirit energy!

Snowy was absorbing the spirit energy here!

If Yang Ye and An Nanjing were just destroying by force, Snowy was destroying in a way that utterly destroyed the world.

Once she absorbed all the spirit energy here, the Origin World would dry up and be in ruins!

Moreover, once there was no spirit energy left to support this place, all the formations and barriers here would be rendered useless. At that time, the bridge would be completely useless, and the Boundless Water would flood the Origin World!

She planned to destroy the Origin World from its foundation!

Yang Ye and the others were only exacting physical destruction, but she was destroying it at its core!

Gu Jiantian glanced coldly at Snowy, and then he looked up at the sky and spoke ferociously, “Are you still not done with her?”

Deal with Qi Bitian!

She was their greatest enemy!

The battle in the air had fallen into a stalemate!

Mr. Jing, the Divine Abode’s Master, and the others had extremely unsightly expressions on their faces! It was because they sensed that the situation was off!

Because the Violet Dimensional Threads weren’t able to go closer than an inch away from Qi Bitian.

At this moment, they’d realized that there was a problem.

Qi Bitian was intentionally keeping them busy!

They didn’t dare to release their energy now. Because once they did that, they would suffer backlash, and it wasn’t backlash from their own energy, it was backlash from Qi Bitian!

She would definitely use the opportunity to strike a lethal blow against them!

No one could bear the consequences of that!

Mr. Jing stared at Qi Bitian, “You could have just fled, so why do this? What are you trying to achieve?!”

Qi Bitian grinned, “Go figure!”

Mr. Jing’s face became extremely unsightly.

Suddenly, a voice emerged from a point in space to his right, “She’s suppressing.”

Qi Bitian glanced in that direction and smiled silently.

Mr. Jing glanced in that direction and spoke solemnly, “Please tell us more!”

A moment of silence ensued, and then the voice explained, “She can’t use her full strength because using it would attract Destiny here. She’s willing to keep all of you busy to suppress herself. Otherwise, even double your forces wouldn’t be able to suppress her. So, trying to seal her is no different than creating a prison of your own making.”

It was a prison of their own making!

At this moment, Mr. Jing and the others’ expressions turned extremely unsightly!

Mr. Jing seemed to have thought of something and looked toward the source of the voice, “Are you not going to help?”

Qi Bitian gazed at the source of the voice, “You’re stronger than them. If you join in, maybe you’ll really be able to seal me up. Aren’t you going to give it a try?”

The voice chuckled, “Abyss Lord, you must be joking.”

Qi Bitian shrugged and looked down at Tian Xiu. At this moment, Tian Xiu was being kept busy by the joint forces of four peak Destiny Realm experts.

No, she’d completely suppressed them in battle now!

She was suppressing four peak Destiny Realm experts on her own!

Qi Bitian shook her head and smiled, “She’s really strong!”

Qi Bitian looked up outer space, and there was a trace of worry deep within her eyes.

She was worried!

Snowy was still absorbing the spirit energy here. It wasn’t a very fast process, but it wasn’t slow either.

The entire Origin World has started to change!

The spirit energy here was vanishing, and issues were starting to arise in many parts of the Origin World.

Meanwhile, more and more sprites were entering the Origin World.

Gu Jiantian’s face was extremely unsightly. He knew that if Snowy was allowed to continue, then she would be absolutely capable of absorbing all the spirit energy here!

Once all the spirit energy here vanished, the Origin World would be ruined.

Or it should be said that the Origin World would vanish from this universe!

Gu Jiantian glanced at the surroundings and said, “I don’t know if all of you’ve been holding back, but if she’s allowed to continue, then this world will be destroyed. Once it’s destroyed, that place we reside in will be affected. At that time, there will be nowhere left for us to hide.”

At this moment, he was helpless to change anything on his own. Because after she received the assistance of all the sprites, Snowy was beyond the strength of Destiny Realm experts! Coupled with the fact that she had An Nanjing and Yang Ye by her side, he wasn’t able to deal with them on his own!

The Desolate Emperor smiled as he watched all of this. The victor of this incident didn’t matter to him. Because no matter how it ended, the desolate race would definitely benefit from it. Of course, he didn’t really care about the benefits.

All he wanted to know now was how the situation would develop!

Once Gu Jiantian finished speaking, the surroundings fell silent!

A short while later, an extremely cold gust of wind appeared here.

A middle aged man appeared on the bridge!

It was the Yin Lord of the Yin World whom Yang Ye had met the other day!

The Yin Lord glanced coldly at Yang Ye, and then he looked up at Qi Bitian, “You killed my wife!”

In order to rope in the Yin World, and because the Origin World and Qi Bitian were practically irreconcilable enemies, the Origin World had told him how his wife had died!

However, the Yin Lord had been tricked by Yang Ye to chase down someone he shouldn’t have gone after, and he’d almost died as a result of that. He’d been recuperating until now, and he was finally brave enough to show himself and seek revenge again!

In the sky, Qi Bitian didn’t pay any attention to the Yin Lord!

A ferocious expression instantly covered the Yin Lord’s face, and then he transformed into a gust of cold wind that surged into the sky!

Qi Bitian glanced at him, and then she formed a claw with her right hand and clawed at him!

Bang!

An ethereal palm descended upon the cold wind, and then it clenched down on the wind.

Bang!

The wind was instantly obliterated, and the Yin Lord returned to where he’d been.

The Yin Lord turned pale, and face was absolutely unsightly.

He gazed at Qi Bitian again, and his eyes were filled with a solemn expression.

He was no match for her!

As soon as they clashed, the Yin Lord was absolutely certain of the gap between them!

The Yin Lord’s expression changed, and it didn’t take long for him to look at Yang Ye!

Since he couldn’t defeat the senior, he planned to attack the junior!

The Yin Lord slowly clenched his right hand, and then a wave of powerful cold winds soundlessly condensed into form around him.

Yang Ye frowned slightly while a strand of powerful slaughter intent swept out from him. But it didn’t take long for Snowy to absorb all of it!

She’d absorbed it!

But just a short while later, Snowy frowned slightly, and she spat it out and returned it all to Yang Ye!

She wasn’t really fond of its taste!

It was too bloody!

After she returned the slaughter intent to Yang Ye, Snowy gazed at the Yin Lord and silently clenched her paw. A wave of powerful energy started to seep out of her paw!

The Yin Lord’s cold winds actually showed signs of being suppressed before this energy!

The Yin Lord gazed at Snowy, and then he instantly frowned, “The Sprite Progenitor!”

But just a moment later, a ferocious expression appeared on his face, “Even if you’re the Sprite Progenitor, I’m still going to annihilate you!”

He was about to attack while he spoke.

However, a voice suddenly came from the bridge, “It’s so lively here today!”

As soon as the voice resounded, countless looked toward its source.

Qi Bitian frowned slightly, “It’s him…”
