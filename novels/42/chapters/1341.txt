Roar!

The enraged howl of a demon beast suddenly resounded through the sky, and then a black show appeared in the air. The black shadow was extremely swift, and it instantly arrived before Yang Ye. At this moment, Yang Ye saw its appearance clearly. It was a demon beast, a completely pitch black demon beast that was shaped like a panther and had a horn on its head.

The black panther didn’t stop and just slammed its body towards Yang Ye.

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly, and he drew his sword and swung it!

Bang!

A loud explosion resounded as the black panther was blasted around 1km away while Yang Ye moved around 300m back.

Yang Ye had quite a solemn expression on his face. While this demon beast wasn’t as strong as the Demon Empress, it wasn’t much weaker. He hadn’t expected the demon race to actually possess such an expert.

Roar!

The black panther gazed ferociously at Yang Ye while strands of terrifying aura surged out incessantly from within it. It was about to charge at Yang Ye but was stopped by the Demon Empress, “Grand Elder, I’ll keep him busy. You help our forces breach the city!”

The black panther glanced at her and said, “His strength is extraordinary. Be careful!”

The Demon Empress nodded.

The black panther glanced at Yang Ye, and then it transformed into a black shadow that shot towards Doomsday City.

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly, and he was about to attack. However, the Demon Empress obstructed his path and smiled, “Surprised?”

Yang Ye nodded, “I’m quite surprised indeed!”

She gazed at him and said, “Do you know why the human race lost? Because it isn’t united. The overall strength of the human race and especially its peak forces far surpass the demon race. Just like before. If all of you were able to stay united with the Nie Clan, then my demon race wouldn’t have a chance to win. Unfortunately, all of you weren’t united. As for my demon race, I just have to give the order, and no one will refuse to obey!”

Yang Ye glanced at her, turned around to gaze at Doomsday City, and there was a trace of worry in his eyes.

Meanwhile, Ye Liuyun’s expression changed when she saw the black panther attack, and she hurriedly said, “Activate the sword formation!”

Om!

As soon as she gave the order, an ear piercing sword howl erupted in the sky above the city, and then over 10,000 swords appeared there. At the same time, the over 40 sword cultivators in Blade appeared in the sky, and then their sword intent surged out into those swords.

“Attack!” A voice resounded in the sky above the city.

As soon as the order was given, the swords in the sky suddenly emanated countless rays of light. All of those rays of light converged together to form a huge sword of light that shot towards the black panther.

The black panther didn’t retreat and even sped up instead. Just like that, the sword and panther slammed against each other outside the city.

Bang!

The huge sword of light was instantly shattered, and it transformed into countless rays of light that swept towards the surroundings. As for the black panther, it was blasted over 3km away!

The Demon Empress’ face fell when she witnessed this scene, but Yang Ye heaved a sigh of relief instead. Even though he knew the sword formation was extraordinary, he didn’t know exactly how strong it was. Now, he was quite surprised when he witnessed its strength. After all, the black panther was extremely strong, and it could be said to be even stronger than Nie Tian!

However, the blank panther had been blasted back by a single attack from the sword formation. Even though it hadn’t killed the black panther, it was extremely formidable.

“That sword formation isn’t bad!” The Demon Empress suddenly said, “However, I wonder how long it can last!”

As soon as she finished speaking, she waved her right hand.

In an instant, the over 200 pythons that remained stationary outside Doomsday City had charged at the city. At the same time, the flying demon beasts swarmed the city from above.

The entire demon race was attacking now!

This time, it hadn’t held back at all!

Yang Ye glanced at the corpses of humans and demon beasts on the ground below, and then he gazed at the Demon Empress. He’d intended to say something, but he didn’t say anything in the end. At such a point in time, it was pointless to say anything.

Yang Ye rubbed his forehead, and then the Sword God’s Seal instantly lit up.

The Demon Empress’ eyes narrowed slightly at the sight of this, and a solemn expression appeared on her face. Actually, she was quite afraid that Yang Ye would activate the Sword God’s Seal. Based on Yang Ye’s current strength, she would be absolutely incapable of stopping him once he utilized the Sword God’s Seal.

However, Yang Ye would naturally not activate it and forcefully improve his sword intent. Even though he would be able to defeat the Demon Empress by doing that, the consequences of the backlash from it were something that he couldn’t bear. He hadn’t forgotten how besides the demon race, he still had to face the Nie Clan’s Nie Wuming. What if Nie Wuming made an appearance while he was suffering from the backlash? At that time, would anyone in the human race be able to stop him?

Moreover, what if he wasn’t able to kill the Demon Empress right away. Once she was able to keep him busy until he suffered from the backlash, then the human race would be finished.

Once the Sword God’s Seal lit up, Yang Ye’s Rebirth Rank sword intent instantly grew even sharper.

Yang Ye held the ancient sheath in hand as he sheathed Heaven’s Gravestone within it, and then he immediately drew it and swung it.

The sword left its sheath, and a ray of blood red sword energy flashed through the sky towards the Demon Empress.

At the moment Yang Ye drew his sword, the Demon Empress had raised her palms slightly. In an instant, the space around her warped. A moment later, she pressed her palms together and swiftly slammed them in Yang Ye’s direction.

Bang!

An invisible wave of energy instantly appeared here. An energy palm emerged from the space before the Demon Empress, and it slammed against Yang Ye’s sword energy.

Their attacks had just come into contact when a terrifying wave of energy erupted from the point of collision. But it didn’t take long for Yang Ye to suddenly vanish on the spot, and then a ray of light flashed through the air. Everywhere it passed, the wave of energy was instantly sliced apart. Actually, the wave of energy wasn’t the only thing that had been sliced apart, the space before it was sliced apart as well!

At the same time that Yang Ye’s figure vanished, the Demon Empress revealed a ferocious expression on her face, and then she transformed into a ray of light that shot towards Yang Ye.

Rumble!

Because Yang Ye and the Demon Empress were fighting there, the space in the sky was trembling violently.

But it didn’t take long for a change to occur in the situation. The Demon Empress was in a disadvantaged position. Yang Ye’s frenzied attacks caused her to be pushed back repeatedly, and after around 15 minutes passed, she was completely suppressed!

Mo Xiaoleng’s face turned icy cold at the sight of this. 2 balls of flames immediately appeared on her palms, but she seemed to have thought of something when she was about to lend the Demon Empress a hand, causing her to swiftly turn to look at Doomsday City. At this moment, Snowy had opened her mouth. Mo Xiaoleng’s expression changed at the sight of this, and she hurriedly kept the flames back.

After all, Snowy didn’t just absorb the flames, she absorbed their quintessence as well. If even that was sucked away, then these natural treasures would truly be leaving her!

Snowy blinked when she saw Mo Xiaoleng put the flames away, and then her eyes opened wide. She glared at Mo Xiaoleng and was even prepared to charge at Mo Xiaoleng. However, Zi’er held tightly onto her. Those flames weren’t the sole source of Mo Xiaoleng’s strength. It could be said that if Snowy and her didn’t counter Mo Xiaoleng’s abilities, no one on the human race’s side would stand a chance against the joint forces of Mo Xiaoleng and the Demon Empress!

Even Yang Ye who’d attained the Emperor Realm wouldn’t be able to gain the upper hand in a battle with the Demon Empress and Mo Xiaoleng.

The black panther outside the city had clearly noticed the situation that the Demon Empress faced, and it was about to lend the Demon Empress a hand. However, the Demon Empress’ voice suddenly came from the sky, “Ignore me. Attack the city at full force and breach it as soon as possible.”

The black panther hesitated for a moment before ferocity covered its face.

Roar!

It roared with fury, and then its figure instantly started to grow. In just a breath of time, it was almost 100 times larger, and it was the largest demon beast here.

At this moment, its height was practically comparable to Doomsday City!

As soon as they saw this scene, Ye Liuyun and the others had unsightly expressions on their faces.

Roar!

Along with a furious howl, the demon beasts before it moved aside and opened up a path for the black panther. In next to no time, the black panther started dashing. At the moment it started dashing, the entire ground and even the entire city started trembling!

Ye Liuyun clenched her hands. How could she dare to let the enlarged black panther collide with Doomsday City? She immediately raised her right hand, and then the swords in the sky above the city instantly started to spin madly. As for Dugu Jian and the other members of Blade, they madly released their sword intent into those swords, causing the swords to ceaselessly emanate ear piercing sword howls.

When the black panther was around 30m away from Doomsday City, Ye Liuyun suddenly waved her palm down, “Attack!”

As soon as she gave the order, the swords in the sky immediately transformed into rays of light that surged at the black panther. How grand was a scene of 10,000 swords descending from the sky?

They were like a meteor shower descending upon the black panther.

But the black panther showed no intent to retreat or stop the swords. It just did one thing, and that was speech up. It was growing faster and faster. When it was around 15m away from Doomsday City, the swords in the sky had finally arrived before it. However, it still didn’t dodge or try to stop them.

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss! Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!

The swords shot into the black panther’s body, and then around 10,000 pillars of blood sprayed up into the air. It was magnificent and bloody!

The experts on the city walls immediately heaved sighs of relief at the sight of this. If that huge fellow were to slam itself against the city, then Doomsday City would definitely collapse. However, it didn’t take long for their expressions to change and turn quite ghastly pale.

Because that black panther that was bleeding from all over its body hadn’t stopped, and it was still dashing forward!

Its eyes were filled with ferocity and resolve. Even though 10,000 swords had pierced it, it hadn’t slowed down at all. It didn’t take long for the black panther to arrive around 5m away from the city.

An instant later, only 3m remained.

At this moment, despair covered the faces of everyone throughout the city!

When the black panther arrived around 1m away from the city walls, while the color in its eyes had started to fade, there was a savage smile on the corners of its mouth.

“My demon race shall prosper!” The black panther’s slightly hoarse howl resounded through the surroundings, and then its body leaped forward and slammed against the city.

Bang!

A loud explosion resounded before the city walls collapsed!
