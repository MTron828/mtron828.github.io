Chapter 1980 – My Lord!

The voice was quite familiar!

Yang Ye looked up, and a woman was walking slowly in his direction.

She had bare feet and wore a red dress!

Yang Ye recognized her. She was the woman in a red dress from Moment Mountain.

An evil cultivator!

He’d come to the large universe with her. However, he hadn’t seen her again after they arrived in the large universe. He hadn’t expected that he would meet her here.

Meanwhile, the woman had arrived before him.

The woman in a red dress said, “You’ve changed a lot!”

Yang Ye sized up the woman, “Aren’t you the same?”

Yang Ye asked, “What are you doing here?”

She replied, “I’m here to look for someone!”

Yang Ye asked, “You’re looking for someone?”

She nodded slightly and glanced at Yang Ye, “If I’m not wrong, you should have met him!”

The old man from before!

Yang Ye knew who she was talking about.

Meanwhile, the woman in a red dress added, “He’s the eldest disciple of the Evil Progenitor. He seized the moment when the Evil Progenitor wasn’t paying attention to take the Yin Soul Streamer and flee to this place. After a great deal of investigation, I finally determined that he was here.”

Yang Ye remained silent.

She added, “Has that thing fallen into your hands?”

“What thing?” Yang Ye gazed at her with a puzzled expression in his eyes.

She gazed at him and spoke indifferently, “Is this necessary?”

Yang Ye shrugged, “I really don’t know what you’re talking about!”

She said, “It belongs to my Evil Sect!”

Yang Ye spoke in a low voice, “I don’t really understand what you mean.”

She gazed at Yang Ye for a long time and nodded. Suddenly, she tapped her finger forward.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye swiftly drew his sword.

An instant later, they were 3km away from each other.

Yang Ye glanced at her from afar, “I don’t want to become enemies with the Evil Sect!”

She said, “Then hand it over!”

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly, “Why should I?”

She didn’t say anything and just vanished on the spot. A moment later, a few dozen rays of red light enveloped Yang Ye.

Suddenly, a sword howl resounded, and then the red light was sliced into pieces by a ray of sword energy. However, a palm suddenly slapped down upon Yang Ye’s chest.

Bang!

Yang Ye was blasted 300m away!

As soon as he stopped himself, she’d appeared before him again. However, she didn’t use her hands and kicked him with her right leg instead.

Bang!

A ray of red light swept out, and it blasted Yang Ye backwards repeatedly.

Suddenly, numerous afterimages of Yang Ye suddenly appeared.

Afterimages covered the area!

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!

At the moment they appeared, the sound of space being sliced apart resounded.

Shadow Sword!

Yang Ye didn’t dare to act carelessly against her. After all, she was someone who’d lived for countless years!

Three breaths of time later, they appeared 3km away from each other again!

Both of them seemed to be completely fine on the outside!

She sized up Yang Ye and said, “I didn’t expect you to have grown to such an extent!”

Yang Ye shrugged, “I never expected this too. If you attack me again, then we can fight to the death today!” He didn’t want to become enemies with the Evil Sect, and he didn’t want to become enemies with this mysterious woman before him. However, his patience was limited.

She gazed at him for a long time, and then she said, “That thing will bring a lot of trouble to you!”

Yang Ye looked her in the eyes, “Someone from your Evil Sect wanted to kill me, but I killed him. Yet now, your Evil Sect is here asking for the spoils of my battle. So, do you think I’m easy to bully?” Yang Ye’s expression turned icy cold as he finished speaking.

She shook her head slightly. She didn’t say another word and just left.

At the moment she vanished, her voice came from afar, “We’ll meet again!”

Meet again!

Yang Ye chuckled and left.

After he left the ancient city, Yang Ye sped up again. Presently, he had to get those 12 swords as soon as possible, and then help A’Man and the others. While he hadn’t known them for long, he treated them as friends!

A ray of light shot swiftly through the mountains! During this period, Yang Ye sensed many powerful auras and had fought some powerful demon beasts. He won some battles and lost some. The strength of some demon beasts simply surpassed his imagination, and they forced him to retreat!

Fortunately, they weren’t fast enough, so they couldn’t catch up to him!

Around six hours later, Yang Ye stopped. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

It was because a boundless desert had appeared before him.

He’d finally gotten through Hell Mountain Range.

Yang Ye turned around and shot a glance at the mountain range behind him, and then he transformed into a ray of light that shot towards the desert.

According to the information that the middle aged man had given him, he would arrive at the Weapon Cemetery after passing through the desert.

Suddenly, an explosion resounded from the desert below, and then a red shadow shot up into the sky and slammed against Yang Ye.

Bang!

Yang Ye was forced to a stop.

Once he stopped there, the red shadow had vanished!

It had vanished!

Yang Ye slowly clenched the sword in his right hand. Suddenly, the space on his right cracked open, and a red shadow shot out from there.

Yang Ye raised his sword and swung it.

Bang!

The red shadow was blasted over 1km away.

At this moment, Yang Ye saw it clearly. It was a completely crimson red scorpion. It was a few times larger than a human, and it was completely crimson.

At this moment, the red scorpion was staring at Yang Ye, and its eyes were filled with viciousness and fear!

Suddenly, the red scorpion leaped up and charged at Yang Ye.

Yang Ye tightened his grip on his sword and closed his eyes.

An instant later, countless afterimages appeared here.

Two breaths of time later, Yang Ye returned to where he’d been standing earlier, and there was a headless red scorpion in front of him.

Yang Ye lowered his sword and was about to leave when he seemed to have thought of something. He waved his right hand, and a fist-sized pearl flew out of the corpse.

The inner core!

Yang Ye sized up the pearl before him. Suddenly, a small claw grabbed it.

It was Snowy!

Snowy held it in her arms and cracked a smile at Yang Ye.

Yang Ye rubbed her head, “Alright, you can have it!”

Snowy’s smile grew even wider.

It didn’t take long for her to take the inner core back into the Primordial Pagoda with her.

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings and continued forward. However, he stopped flying on his sword.

Flying on his sword painted a huge target on his back!

Yang Ye traveled carefully all along the way and coupled with the concealment he received from the Sword Domain, he didn’t encounter any trouble. However, this didn’t last for long.

After night descended, Yang Ye suddenly noticed that something was off!

Because the sand beneath him was actually trembling!

There was something down below!

Yang Ye didn’t stay and just vanished into the distance.

Yang Ye couldn’t help but take a glance behind him after he arrived over 10km away, and this glance made a chill run down his spine.

Yang Ye immediately turned around and sped up!

Around six hours later, Yang Ye had passed through the desert.

A crimson red expanse of land was beyond the desert. It seemed like flames had burned through the area!

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings and continued forward. But he hadn’t gone far before a damaged city appeared before him.

There were two words atop the city gates—Weapon City!

Weapon City!

I’m finally here! Yang Ye sized up the city. It was perfectly silent, and there was no movement coming from within it.

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment, and then he transformed into a shadow that snuck into the city. Suddenly, the gates opened, and then a huge sword slashed down at him.

Bang!

Yang Ye was blasted over 1km away!

Yang Ye glanced at his slightly numb arm, and then he looked up. A middle aged man in armor had appeared before the gates.

The middle aged man’s gaze was quite blank as he looked ahead.

A puppet? Yang Ye glanced at the damaged walls of the city. It was completely empty. He fell silent for a moment before appearing before the city walls. He was about to enter, but the middle aged man suddenly appeared in front of him, and the huge sword in his hand descended once more.

Bang!

Yang Ye was blasted away again!

This time, it wasn’t just his arm that was numb, even his entire body felt numb!

He’s strong! Yang Ye looked up at the middle aged man. The middle aged man was a See Dao Realm expert at the very least, and he wasn’t an ordinary one either. The middle aged man’s strength was much greater than Dire Wolf!

Actually, Yang Ye had struck the middle aged man’s weak point when they collided earlier, but for some reason, the middle aged man had been able to make the weak point vanish at the last moment, so he wasn’t able to use technique to deal with the middle aged man’s strength!

The middle aged man didn’t pursue Yang Ye and just guarded the gates.

Yang Ye fell silent for a moment, and then he suddenly appeared above the middle aged man. After that, he grabbed his sword with both hands and swung it down.

This time, he didn’t try to use technique, and he just used pure strength!

A head-on collision!

The middle aged man raised his sword and swung it!

Bang!

A figure was blasted away, and it flew over 1km away!

It was Yang Ye!

Yang Ye wiped off the blood on the corner of his mouth, and then he looked up at the middle aged man. The middle aged man was much stronger than he’d imagined!

He was about to attack again when he seemed to have thought of something, and then he stopped and withdrew a seal.

The Weapon Seal!

It was the seal that the middle aged man had given him that day!

It was the symbol of the Seal Master from the Slaughter Line of the Weapon Path!

The middle aged man was stunned when he saw the seal, and then he walked slowly towards Yang Ye and took a knee, “My Lord!”

Yang Ye was stunned speechless.
