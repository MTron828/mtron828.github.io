Chapter 1004 – She Feeds On The Eye Of The Heaven Dao!

FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Yu Wushuang was stunned on the spot when she heard Oblivion Maiden.

She has killed Saints? And she has killed many?

Who is she?

Yu Wushuang gazed at Qing and shouted anxiously, “Senior, stop her!”

Regardless of who Oblivion Maiden was, she’d dared to go face Yang Ye even when she knew that he possessed the strength to kill Saints. That represented that she was definitely confident in her own strength. Moreover, Yang Ye had just undergone fierce battles with 2 Saints in succession. So, regardless of whether it was his physical strength or profound energy, they were definitely at a weak state. So, she’d decisively chosen to ask Qing to stop Oblivion Maiden as a precaution!

Qing’s gaze had descended onto Oblivion Maiden at the instant that Oblivion Maiden had started to walk towards Yang Ye. Qing hesitated for a moment when she heard Yu Wushuang, and then she flicked a ray of light towards Oblivion Maiden.

Oblivion Maiden’s face remained calm when she noticed that ray of light shooting towards her, and she held the fox in her left arm as she lightly tapped her right index finger against the ray of light.

It was like time was frozen when Oblivion Maiden’s finger touched the ray of light, and then a moment of silence ensued before the ray of light vanished without making a single sound. It was like it had never existed!

Qing’s pupils constricted, and there was fear and shock in her eyes!

The mysterious energy that Oblivion Maiden possessed felt extremely dangerous to Qing!

Oblivion Maiden paid no attention to Qing, and she just continued walking step by step towards Yang Ye. Meanwhile, Yang Ye’s Saint Realm Sword Servant, Li Yun, suddenly shot towards Oblivion Maiden.

In the beginning, Li Yun was extremely quick to the point that Yu Wushuang and the others couldn’t even see him clearly. However, it didn’t take long for him to slow down, and he was growing slower and slower. When he arrived in front of Oblivion Maiden, it seemed like he’d fallen into a swamp and found it difficult to even take a step forward!

After that, Oblivion Maiden didn’t even seem to have done anything, but Li Yun actually started to decompose and vanish into thin air!

Everyone here was astounded by the sight of that!

“She was telling the truth....” Yu Wushuang’s eyes were filled with astonishment as she watched Li Yun vanish without a trace. Yu Wushuang had thought that Oblivion Maiden had been exaggerating when she said that she’d killed many Saints in the past, but the truth was that Oblivion Maiden really possessed the ability to kill Saints, and it was with such ease!

Qing’s eyes narrowed when she saw Oblivion Maiden kill Li Yun with such ease, and there was shock in her eyes. She hadn’t expected that there was another Half-Saint besides Yang Ye in Pine Prefecture who could kill a Saint. Moreover, it was even done with such ease. Who exactly is that woman?

When she saw Oblivion Maiden continuing towards Yang Ye, Qing pondered deeply for an instant and was about to attack. However, Yang Ye appeared in front of her, and he shook his head in her direction.

Qing glanced at him and stopped.

Yang Ye turned around to gaze at Oblivion Maiden, and there was a solemn expression in his eyes. Even though Li Yun wasn’t a true Saint, he was extremely strong. But Oblivion Maiden had actually killed him with such ease!

Even Yang Ye couldn’t accomplish that without his Divine Rank treasures! However, Oblivion Maiden hadn’t just been able to accomplish that, she’d accomplished it with such ease!

A formidable enemy! Yang Ye gazed at her for a long time before he said, “You are the one who was looking for me?”

She nodded, “For a very long time.”

Yang Ye asked, “You’re here to kill me?”

She nodded again.

Yang Ye asked, “Is there a reason?”

She raised her head to look at him before she spoke, “I’m from the Nether Pavilion!”

The Nether Pavilion! Yang Ye’s eyes instantly narrowed when he heard her. He knew that the Nether Pavilion would definitely dispatch its forces to kill him after he killed those 13 members of the Nether Pavilion and You Wuying. But he’d never expected it to dispatch someone so quickly. Moreover, it was actually someone who possessed a status similar to Nether Maiden!

Oblivion Maiden suddenly started walking towards Yang Ye as she spoke, “You killed Shadow Maiden who hadn’t awakened yet. So, you have to die.”

“Can you give me a moment first?” Yang Ye suddenly spoke before withdrawing another violet crystal and swallowing it.

Oblivion Maiden glanced at Yang Ye, pondered deeply for an instant, and then said, “A’Li wants to go home. However, I can wait if you promise me that you won’t run.”

“I definitely won’t run!” Yang Ye guaranteed, “I just want to ask you a few things.”

She replied, “Go ahead!”

“Is the Nether Pavilion very strong?” asked Yang Ye. He’s always been very curious about that mysterious power called the Nether Pavilion. Unfortunately, he knew nothing about it. Now that he’d encountered a core member of it, he naturally refused to let go of such an opportunity to ask about it.

Oblivion Maiden glanced at Yang Ye and said, “It is!”

Yang Ye asked, “How stronger is it when compared to Sky Divine Hall?”

She spoke calmly, “It can be destroyed in an instant!”

The corners of his mouth twitched. I’ve brought quite the calamity upon myself.

Yang Ye thought for a moment and said, “I remember that the Nether Pavilion has 10 pavilions. In other words, it has 10 pavilion masters. How is your strength ranked amongst them?”

She lowered her head slightly, and a long time passed before she said, “The 9th!”

“Are you joking!?” Yang Ye cried out involuntarily and said, “You are so strong, yet you’re only ranked at the 9th position? Are you trying to scare me?”

She spoke softly, “There are so many there who are stronger than me!”

Yang Ye gulped because she didn’t seem to be lying. In other words, the Nether Pavilion had dispatched one of its weakest members. But that weakest member could kill Saints. Just thinking about it caused the corners of Yang Ye’s mouth to twitch.

This really is quite a calamity!

“Actually, you’re not bad!” She glanced at Yang Ye and spoke softly, “At the very least, I would definitely be unable to catch up to you if you are to flee!”

Yang Ye’s face darkened. Are you praising me or insulting me?

She asked, “Do you have any other questions?”

Yang Ye pondered deeply for a moment and said, “Who’s the strongest amongst the 10 of you?”

She replied, “The legendary Sky Maiden!”

Yang Ye asked, “Why is she the strongest?”

Oblivion Maiden gazed at him and spoke calmly, “She feeds on the Eye of the Heaven Dao!”

Yang Ye’s pupils constricted. She feeds on the Eye of the Heaven Dao? In other words, she can eat it? Is that a joke?

Right when Yang Ye was about to ask another question, she said, “You can only ask one last question.”

Yang Ye glanced at her, pondered deeply for a moment, and said, “Do you know Nether Maiden?”

She frowned slightly, “How do you know her?”

“Looks like you do know her!” Yang Ye continued, “Can you tell me about her?”

Oblivion Maiden said, “I don’t like her!”

Yang Ye was quite surprised, “Why?”

“She likes to fight!” Oblivion Maiden spoke in a low voice, “She fights all day and night!”

Yang Ye was speechless.

Oblivion Maiden started walking towards Yang Ye, “Alright, I’m going to kill you now!”

“One last question!” Yang Ye said, “Are you confident in your ability to kill me?”

She was puzzled, “You aren’t very strong, so why wouldn’t I?”

The corners of Yang Ye’s mouth twitched. Is she naïve or is she trying to infuriate me on purpose?

Yang Ye stopped allowing his thoughts to run wild and took a short breath. At this moment, he’d almost recovered completely under the help of the violet crystal he consumed. Even though he wasn’t at his peak, he felt that he should be able to fight her!

“Slash!” Yang Ye suddenly roared furiously, and Yellow Swings shot swiftly towards her. A brilliant ray of sword energy tore through space and instantly arrived before her.

However, a strange scene appeared there. The sword energy actually started to split apart at an alarming speed upon arriving in front of her, and it only took an instant for it to vanish completely.

Yang Ye’s pupils constricted when he witnessed this scene. After all, his sword energy was enhanced by Void Rank sword intent! What energy is she using?

Meanwhile, Oblivion Maiden took a step forward, and then she instantly appeared in front of Yang Ye before tapping her finger in his direction.

It was an extremely ordinary tap that didn’t carry any fluctuations of energy!

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly. He naturally didn’t dare act carelessly or underestimate her attack. He immediately waved his right hand, and the Dimensional Cube flashed out and instantly enveloped her. At this moment, the space within the Dimensional Cube instantly warped and overlapped, and it seemed to be about to fold and warp her figure.

However, Nether Maiden’s face was calm as she swiftly pressed her palms forward.

Crack! Crack!

The warped space around her instantly started to decompose, and only a moment passed before it had been transformed into tens of thousands of pieces. After that, those pieces were decomposed again, and they became hundreds of thousands of pieces, then they vanished!

It wasn’t just the space there which had vanished, even Yang Ye’s Dimensional Cube, a Divine Rank treasure, had vanished as well!

Yang Ye’s expression became unprecedentedly solemn when he witnessed this scene. After all, the Dimensional Cube was a Divine Rank treasure, and it could even stop the attacks of Saints. However, it couldn’t resist a light attack from the woman.

What exactly is that energy? Yang Ye held tightly onto Yellow Springs. He’d intended to seize the opportunity to attack, but when he saw how easily she’d destroyed the Dimensional Cube, Yang Ye knew that even Jadedrop and Yellow Springs wouldn’t be able to stop that mysterious energy of hers. Perhaps only Heaven’s Gravestone could resist that mysterious energy of hers!

Yang Ye asked solemnly, “What is that energy?”

“I don’t know!” She walked towards Yang Ye as she said, “So long as it’s material that I understand, then I can rearrange or decompose them!”

Yang Ye asked, “Then what about material that you don’t understand?”

“I don’t know!” As soon as she finished speaking, she was already in front of Yang Ye, and she stretched out her hand and tapped a finger in Yang Ye’s direction, “Don’t worry, it won’t hurt.”

“Come! Let me see if you can decompose this!” As soon as Yang Ye finished speaking, he took a step forward and stretched out a finger towards her as well.

A mysterious strand of energy was flickering on the tip of Yang Ye’s finger.

It was the Laws of Decay!
