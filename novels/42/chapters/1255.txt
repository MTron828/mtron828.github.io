Chapter 1256 – I Don’t Want To Jump Into Your Trap!

“Human! Don’t even dream about making me fight for you!” The black ape turned around and started walking away.

Demon beasts were proud, let alone a Voider Realm expert like the black ape? If Yang Ye’s strength was utterly superior to his own, then perhaps it would be possible. However, Yang Ye’s current strength wasn’t enough at all.

Yang Ye knew that, but he wasn’t prepared to give up. He obstructed the black ape’s path and said, “Don’t act like you want to hit me. Let me just ask you whether you want to leave this place?”

The black ape replied, “I can leave whenever I want!”

Yang Ye shook his head, “Not leave this place, leave this world!”

The black ape’s eyes narrowed slightly, “What are you trying to say?”

Yang Ye replied, “This world is like a cage to all of you. Don’t you want to leave this cage?”

Most would choose to leave upon attaining the Emperor Realm. Of course, that was because of the Heaven Dao in the Radiant Dimension. Even though there was no Heaven Dao here, he was certain that they would definitely want to leave this world. No one was willing to be trapped. Especially experts at the black ape’s level.

The black ape gazed at Yang Ye for a long time before he said, “No one doesn’t want to leave, but can anyone leave? Can you?”

Yang Ye nodded, “I can!” Even though he didn’t know if he could really leave, it was a matter for the future. Presently, he didn’t want to give up on this big fella. After all, a Voider was too important to the Sword Alliance. So, it was just as the black ape had said, he had to continue deceiving the black ape!

“How laughable!” The black ape spoke coldly, “Human! You’re truly laughable! Do you know what the Voider Realm humans and demon beasts of this world have been doing most of their life? They’ve been thinking about how to escape this world! Because the Voider Realm is the limit of a medium world, and if we want to attain a higher realm of cultivation, we must leave this place and head to a large world to seek energy of higher quality than Quintessence Violet Energy. But since Dark Hell Continent suffered that calamity, no one has been able to leave, including us and many other Voiders who’ve fallen in the past! Why?”

The black ape pointed up at the sky, “Because that energy isn’t something that a Voider can resist! Human! You say that you can leave, and that’s truly beyond laughable. Even if you want to deceive me, please look for a better reason!”

“I never said that I can accomplish it right now!” Yang Ye looked the black ape in the eyes and said, “Let me ask you another question. If Senior Jian Wuji was still alive, then would he be able to leave this world?”

The black ape spoke in a slightly angry tone, “Of course!”

Yang Ye pointed at himself, “Do you think I’ll be able to attain the same height as Senior Jian Wuji in my life? Right, I’m only a mid-rank Saint right now!” As he spoke, Yang Ye removed the Sword Domain’s concealment, and his cultivation was completely exposed before the black ape.

The black ape fell silent as he gazed at Yang Ye. If he were to be honest, the human before him really was the most monstrous genius he’d ever met. Even the geniuses of Sword God’s Palace from all those years couldn’t compare to Yang Ye. After all, Yang Ye possessed such a formidable physical body at such a young age, and his sword intent was even above the Void Rank. Besides that, Yang Ye could fight a Voider like him while at the Saint Realm.

Even though Jian Wuji was a towering mountain that everyone could only look up to, this human before him was truly an extraordinarily monstrous genius!

Yang Ye paid no attention to what the black ape was thinking and continued, “Just give me time and I’ll definitely be able to surpass Jian Wuji’s accomplishments. At that time, would it be difficult to leave this place?”

The black ape remained silent for a short while before he said, “What does all of that have to do with me?”

He walked around Yang Ye while he spoke and started walking towards the exit. However, Yang Ye obstructed his path again, “How is it not related to you? If I surpass Jian Wuji, it will represent that I can leave this world. Since I can leave, it represents that I can bring others out with me. Understand?”

The black ape gazed at Yang Ye, “Human, I have to admit that you’re truly a monstrous genius, and even if you can’t attain the same height as the founding ancestor, you will definitely not be much inferior. I also believe that once you’ve grown further, it’s very likely that you’ll be able to leave this world. But how many years would that take? 10 years? 100 years? 1,000 years? Or 10,000 years?”

“10 years!” Yang Ye looked the black ape in the eyes, “10 years!” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

The black ape replied, “Have you gone mad?”

Yang Ye replied, “I’m only a little over 20 now, yet I’m already capable of fighting Voiders. So, do you think I’m mad?” He’d intended to say 2 years, because he had to leave this place in 2 years. But it would definitely be unrealistic in the black ape’s opinion.

The black ape gazed at Yang Ye and remained silent for a long time, “I won’t submit to a human!”

“I never asked you to submit!” Yang Ye continued, “We can work together! Follow me for 10 years, and I’ll take you out of this world in 10 years. If I fail, then you can just leave. After all, 10 years is just an instant for the demon race, right?”

The black ape fell silent.

The black ape was slightly moved. Meanwhile, Yang Ye added, “You might never be able to leave if you rely on your own strength. Yet now, you might be able to leave if you spend 10 years of your time with me. Why don’t you take the gamble? It’s just 10 years!”

“Do you think I’m a fool?” The black ape glanced at him and said, “Based on your character and temper, I can only imagine how many times I’ll have to fight for you during those years. I don’t want to jump into your trap!”

Yang Ye chuckled with embarrassment, “Fighting is unavoidable, right? The world outside is full of wonder. Are you really sure that you don’t want to head out and have a look? 10 years, it’ll only take 10 years, and you’ll have the chance to leave this place! 10 years is all you need to obtain a chance to charge into a higher realm of cultivation! 10 years is all it’ll take to possibly change your fate! 10 years....”

“Stop!” The black ape suddenly interrupted Yang Ye and said, “I might also die because of you during those 10 years, right?”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

The black ape suddenly said, “Help me do something and I’ll follow you for 10 years!”

Yang Ye was stunned, and then he felt delighted, “What?”

The black ape replied, “Help me seize something!”

“Seize something?” Yang Ye asked, “What is it?”

The black ape suddenly stretched out his hand and tapped Yang Ye’s body, “Your body is at the Divine Shift Realm right now?”

Yang Ye nodded.

The black ape spoke in a slightly tempting voice, “Do you want to attain the Epoch Realm?”

Yang Ye asked, “What are you trying to say?”

The black ape pointed at a certain direction, “There’s an Energy Convergence Pool on the island. The Sword God’s Palace created it all those years ago, and it’s capable of converging the natural essence of the world. In other words, the various types of energy in the world and the energy of the earth. After absorbing for over 20,000 years, the energy within it is extremely pure, and it’s very likely that you’ll attain the Epoch Realm by absorbing some of its contents.”

Yang Ye blinked, “There’s definitely something guarding it, right?”

“Smart!” The black ape continued, “There’s a fellow who has occupied the area. We have to beat him down if we want to get the Energy Convergence Pool!”

Yang Ye asked, “You can’t defeat him?”

The black ape had quite an unsightly expression on his face, and he hesitated for a while before he nodded.

Yang Ye’s expression became quite unnatural when he heard this. After all, even the black ape couldn’t defeat that fellow, so how terrifying was that fellow?

Yang Ye thought for a moment and said, “I’m sure you know that I can’t use my sword upon leaving this place, so my strength will be reduced significantly!”

The black ape replied, “In any case, I’ve given you my condition, so do as you see fit.”

Yang Ye thought for a moment, and then his eyes suddenly lit up, “Why do we have to seize it, we can just steal it!”

The black ape was stunned, “Steal it?”

Yang Ye nodded, and then he concealed his aura, “Look, can you sense my aura?”

The black ape shook his head, “That won’t work. That fellow will be guarding it all day and night, so you won’t have an opportunity to steal it!”

Yang Ye pointed at the black ape, “Isn’t there 2 of us here? You go draw his attention and I’ll do the stealing, understand?”

The black ape frowned and was slightly hesitant.

Yang Ye said, “You just have to keep him busy, not fight him to the death. We’ll run as soon as I get it! Err, you wouldn’t be incapable of even keeping him busy for a short while, right?”

“What nonsense!” The black ape spoke furiously, “Even though I can’t defeat him, it’s impossible for him to defeat me with ease. I’m just thinking about whether you would just flee once you’ve gotten it!”

“You’re doubting me!?” Yang Ye spoke furiously, “Am I such a person? Am I?”

The black ape spoke seriously, “I think you are!”

Yang Ye was speechless.

“I’ll trust you this time!” Meanwhile, the black ape suddenly said, “Human, the contents of the Energy Convergence Pool might be able to help you attain the Epoch Realm, but it isn’t very useful to me. Because my body is already at the Epoch Realm, and it’s very difficult for me to improve it further. I want the energy within the pool for other reasons. So....”

“Don’t worry!” Yang Ye continued, “I’m not one who goes back on my word!”

The black ape glanced at Yang Ye and said, “I’ll trust you this time. Go get ready and come meet at my territory later.”

The black ape shot out of the hall once he finished speaking.

A Voider Realm demon beast!The Epoch Realm!

Yang Ye took a deep breath. If he could obtain the black ape’s help and improve his body to the Epoch Realm, then he would be much more confident in facing the experts from the Veiled Region.

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts and gazed at Yun Banqing, “Are you alright?”

She shook her head slightly, “If I hadn’t witnessed it with my own eyes, I would truly find it impossible to believe that a Saint was actually able to kill a Voider and fight a Voider Realm demon beast.”

During this period that she stayed by Yang Ye’s side, she’d been constantly shocked by him. After all, she’d witnessed a Saint kill a Voider and fight a Voider Realm demon beast. If she hadn’t witnessed it with her own eyes, she would never believe such things were possible!

Yang Ye smiled, “Let’s not talk about that. Tell me about the Void Cloud Shuttle. I don’t really know much about it!”

She nodded slightly and gazed at the Void Cloud Shuttle, “If you have sufficient violet crystals, then it’s actually equivalent to a Voider.”

“It’s equivalent to a Voider?” Yang Ye was stunned.
