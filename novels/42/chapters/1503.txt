Chapter 1504 - Yang Ye Has A Reverse Scale Too!

Translator: InVader

The violet robed young man was naturally not afraid. There were six Deities in front of him, and he had the Nether Emperor Stellar Region backing him. So, did he have to fear Yang Ye?

As far as he was concerned, he naturally didn’t.

The violet robed young man didn’t wait for Yang Ye to reply and pointed at the young man with a ponytail, “Yang Ye, do you know who he is? He’s Young Master Ma Wudi from the Ma Clan in the large world. Do you know the Ma Clan? It’s an extraordinary clan. You…”

Yang Ye suddenly waved his hand and interrupted the violet robed young man, “Since you’re not willing to leave, then stay!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye waved his right hand, and then the Ancient Emperor Python and the two Celestial Demon Wolves appeared before him.

Everyone here was stunned by the sight of them.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye ignored the others here and just waved his hand, “Kill them all!”

The Emperor Python was the first to attack. It swept its huge tail at the Deities around Yang Ye, and Big Blackie and Little Blackie followed closely behind its tail.

Even though there were six Deities around Yang Ye, the Emperor Python and the others were more than enough to deal with them.

Yang Ye paid no further attention to their battle, and he looked at Ma Wudi instead, “No one can save you today!”

As soon as Yang Ye finished speaking, his figure transformed into a ray of light that shot at Ma Wudi.

Ma Wudi’s expression changed when he saw Yang Ye attacked. The collision he had with Yang Ye earlier allowed him to be clearly aware that Yang Ye’s strength far surpassed his own! Earlier, he felt that Yang Ye would definitely die under the joint forces of those six Deities, and that was why he hadn’t fled. Yet now…

At this moment, he didn’t have the chance to flee anymore.

He could only go head-on against Yang Ye! Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

The profound energy within his body surged madly. When Yang Ye’s fist shot down towards his head, a golden ray of light suddenly erupted from within Ma Wudi. It was extremely swift and instantly enveloped both him and Yang Ye.

But just a moment passed before it shattered amidst a loud explosion, and then Ma Wudi was blasted away again.

Yang Ye didn’t stop and was about to pursue Ma Wudi. However, Ma Wudi suddenly withdrew a flag, and then he transformed into a ball of violet light that vanished on the spot.

A Dimensional Teleportation Flag!

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly because he couldn’t sense Ma Wudi’s aura anymore.

“AH!” Suddenly, a shrill cry resounded. Everyone looked towards the source of the cry, and they saw the body of a Deity being transformed into pieces by a swing of the Emperor Python’s tail!

“Yang Ye!” Meanwhile, the violet robed young man suddenly spoke with fury, “Do you know what you’re doing? Do you want to become enemies with my Nether Emperor Stellar Region?” At this moment, he was extremely shocked. He hadn’t expected the demon beasts Yang Ye summoned to be so strong. In just a short while, they’d killed one of the Deities from Nether Emperor Stellar Region!

Yang Ye gazed at the violet robed young man, “Where did that fellow go?”

The violet robed young man spoke fiercely, “Yang Ye, if you don’t make those demon beasts stop right now, Clouds of Heaven Stellar Region will suffer calamity. You…”

Suddenly, Yang Ye vanished on the spot, and he was in front of the young man when he appeared once more. The young man was shocked. He was about to react when two types of intent pressed down upon him like two mountains, causing his figure to stiffen for a moment. It was exactly that moment which allowed Yang Ye to grab the young man’s throat!

The violet robed young man’s eyes opened wide, and they were filled with disbelief. Obviously, he hadn’t expected himself to be captured by Yang Ye!

Even though he didn’t possess Ma Wudi’s strength, he was still a Semi-Deity!

Actually, the violet robed young man wasn’t weak, but Yang Ye wasn’t an existence that Semi-Deities could resist. Not to mention a Semi-Deity, even ordinary Deities couldn’t fight Yang Ye. Yang Ye’s current strength was sufficient to fight Dualism Realm experts, and he was even capable of killing them!

So, Semi-Deities weren’t on the same level as him any longer!

Yang Ye raised the violet robed young man in front of him, “I’ll ask you one last time. Where did he go?”

Horror ran through the young man’s heart as he gazed at Yang Ye’s calm gaze, but he didn’t want to display any weakness. So, he immediately said, “Yang Ye, you… you really intend to go against my Nether Emperor Stellar Region? You…”

Crack!

The violet robed young man’s voice stopped abruptly while accompanied by the sound of bones breaking. A moment later, Yang Ye released his grasp, and then the violet robed young man’s head fell off his neck.

Pu!

A fountain of blood shot up from the young man’s neck!

Yang Ye waved his right hand, and the young man’s corpse was instantly obliterated. After that, he gazed at the woman who was stunned on the spot, “Where did that fellow go?”

The woman returned to her senses when she heard him, and her eyes were filled with fear when she looked at him.

Yang Ye said, “You refuse to tell me too?”

The woman’s expression changed, and she hurriedly said, “He… he has probably gone to Nether Emperor Stellar Region.”

As soon as she finished speaking, she added, “Do… do you realize what you’re doing? Doing this is equivalent to declaring war with my Nether Emperor Stellar Region. You…”

“Declare war?” Yang Ye laughed coldly, “You’re right, from this moment onward, I’m officially declaring war with Nether Emperor Stellar Region.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he flipped his palm and a sword appeared in his grasp. After that, he swung it, and a ray of sword energy shot forward.

Right at the moment the sword energy shot forward, a black robed old man suddenly appeared in front of the woman, and then a beam of black light surged out from him.

Boom!

An explosion resounded. Yang Ye’s sword energy and the beam of black energy vanished. Meanwhile, the black robed old man and the woman were blasted around 3km away.

“AH!!” Suddenly, a shrill cry resounded. Everyone looked towards the source of the voice, and they saw another Deity had been obliterated by the Emperor Python’s tail. In just less than 10 minutes, only four of the six Deities remained.

Moreover, at the moment Yang Ye said that he was declaring war against Nether Emperor Stellar Region, Zhuang Weiran had led all the other forces of Clouds of Heaven Stellar Region into battle, and they attacked the remaining four Deities. She was very well aware that since Yang Ye had said that, he would definitely do as he said. Since Yang Ye said he was declaring war on Nether Emperor Stellar Region, it represented that there was no room for reconciliation between Nether Emperor Stellar Region and Clouds of Heaven Stellar Region.

Just as Yang Ye always said, since they were enemies, it was best to kill them all!

So, she’d chosen to attack decisively.

After Zhuang Weiran and the others joined the battle, those four Deities couldn’t even fight back anymore. Not to mention fighting back, they couldn’t even flee. Because they couldn’t outrun the Celestial Demon Wolves!

Just like that, it took around 10 minutes for all four of those remaining Deities to be killed!

The black robed old man stared at Yang Ye and said, “Yang Ye! You really do like to do things without leaving any room to maneuver! We’ll meet again very soon! Trust me!”

As soon as he finished speaking, a flat appeared in his right grasp, and then a ray of light erupted from it. A moment later, the black robed man and the woman vanished on the spot.

Yang Ye remained silent for a moment, and then he turned to look at Zhuang Weiran, “All of you stay here!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he was about to leave, but Zhuang Weiran appeared in front of him, “Where are you going?”

Yang Ye replied, “Nether Emperor Stellar Region!”

Her expression changed slightly, “What?”

Yang Ye chuckled, “Don’t worry. I know what I’m doing.”

She said, “It isn’t necessary!”

She naturally knew why he was going there. It was definitely because of her. Because Ma Wudi had insulted her just now. Even though she wanted to kill him too, Yang Ye’s safety was even more important to her!

“It is necessary!” Yang Ye shook his head, “I’m a person who likes to think of the worst case scenario. Just think about it. If I didn’t return, or if something happened to me, then what would happen to you and Clouds of Heaven Stellar Region? I’m a vengeful person. Since they wanted to kill you, then I’ll kill them!”

As he spoke, he combed her hair gently, “Don’t worry about me. If I choose to flee, then there’s practically no one in the lower dimensions who can do anything to me. Even if I don’t flee, there’s practically no one who can do anything to me. Just take good care of yourself.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he placed the Emperor Python and the others into the Primordial Pagoda and vanished on the spot.

Zhuang Weiran was slightly stunned, and then she intended to pursue him.

However, Ye Liuyun grabbed her hand, and then Ye Liuyun shook her head at Zhuang Weiran, “You can’t stop him. Even though he looks calm on the surface, rage is surging through his heart. His reverse scale is his loved ones, and that’s all of you. Ma Wudi and Nether Emperor Stellar Region targeted you this time, and it’s equivalent to touching his reverse scale. A dragon goes berserk when its reverse scale is touched, but his temper is worse than a dragon. So, how could he possibly restrain himself?”

Zhuang Weiran shook her head slightly, “It’s dangerous!”

“He won’t do something that he isn’t confident in!” Ye Liuyun said, “Didn’t you notice? He’s much stronger than before. Moreover, I think that he’s even stronger than we think.”

Zhuang Weiran understood that, but she still couldn’t help but feel worried about him. She really wanted to go with Yang Ye, but she had to stay here and protect Clouds of Heaven Stellar Region. After all, many other powers were watching Clouds of Heaven Stellar Region from the shadows. So, if she went with Yang Ye, she wouldn’t be of any help to him.

In the past, she was much stronger than him. However, in just a few years, Yang Ye had surpassed her!

Meanwhile, Ye Liuyun took Zhuang Weiran’s hand and said, “Come, let’s start preparing to deal with the trouble he’s going to create!”

Zhuang Weiran looked up at the sky and nodded, and then she vanished on the spot with Ye Liuyun.

…

After he left Clouds of Heaven Continent, Yang Ye intended to go straight towards Stellar City. But right when he was about to enter the teleportation formation, a man suddenly obstructed his path.

The man asked, “You’re Yang Ye?”

Yang Ye nodded.

“I’ve been looking for you!” A smile curled up on the corners of his mouth, “I’m from the large world, and I’m taking your head. Now…”

Suddenly, Yang Ye drew his sword and swung it.

Three overlapped Heavenrends!

As soon as he finished doing that, he turned around and entered the teleportation formation.

A moment of silence ensued here.

Hiss!

Suddenly, the man’s body split open at the center, and his internal organs sprayed out along with his blood!
