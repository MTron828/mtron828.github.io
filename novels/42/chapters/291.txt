Chapter 292 – The King Realm!

After an unknown period of time, the Beast Emperor suddenly withdrew his hands. At the same time, a terrifying imposing aura surged out from Yang Ye’s body. The Beast Emperor grinned before he waved his hand lightly, and the terrifying imposing aura instantly vanished.

A wisp of admiration and surprise flashed through the Beast Emperor’s eyes as he gazed at Yang Ye who still had his eyes closed tightly. Because he noticed that he’d underestimated the natural talent and potential that Yang Ye possessed! According to his initial estimates, Yang Ye would be able to endure his energy for 15 minutes at most. However, Yang Ye had endured it for almost 4 hours!

Even a Spirit Realm expert would find it difficult to endure his energy for four hours!

However, Yang Ye who was merely at the First Heaven Realm had accomplished such feat! At the same time that the Beast Emperor felt shocked by this, he was slightly puzzled. He was puzzled about the reason why Yang Ye was able to endure so much energy!

After quite some time passed, Yang Ye’s opened his eyes slowly, and then he instantly gasped after he checked his body. Because he noticed that he was already at the King Realm! My god! I’d just advanced by two ranks, yet I’ve actually advanced by a realm now. Isn’t such speed a little too terrifying!?

He didn’t feel any pleasant surprise, and he only felt shocked. Because excessive use of external forces to improve his cultivation would definitely cause irreparable damage to his body!

When he thought up to here, Yang Ye gazed at the Beast Emperor and said, “Senior....”

The Beast Emperor waved his hand and interrupted Yang Ye. “Kid, I know what you want to say, and I know what you’re worried about as well! There’s no need to be worried. The reason I improved your cultivation by force was that your foundation is extremely solid. Moreover, the toughness of your physical body and meridians far exceed an ordinary King Realm expert. In other words, you’ve already satisfied all conditions to attain the King Realm, and the only reason you haven’t advanced was that you lacked a critical factor!”

Yang Ye couldn’t help but heave a sigh of relief when he heard this. It’s fine so long as it doesn’t cause me to suffer from any undetectable injuries.

When he thought up to here, he bowed solemnly to the Beast Emperor and said, “Thank you for your assistance, Senior. I’ll never forget this kindness!”

He’d spoken these words sincerely. Because if it wasn’t for the Beast Emperor, then it would probably take some time for him to advance into the King Realm, and he was truly not confident in his ability to face those monstrous geniuses at the Ancient Battlefield while still at the First Heaven Realm. Now that he’d advanced into the King Realm, then would he, Yang Ye, have to fear anyone in the same realm of cultivation?

The Beast Emperor grinned and said, “There’s no need to thank me. I’ll need your help in the future! I only hope that you wouldn’t refuse when the time comes!”

“May I know what senior needs my help with?” Yang Ye was puzzled. The Beast Emperor possessed extraordinary strength yet actually said that he needed Yang Ye’s help, and this caused Yang Ye to be very bewildered.

“You’ll know when the time comes!” The Beast Emperor smiled, and then he said with a serious expression, “I know you have a proud character and would rather die than submit! However, you absolutely must not cause trouble within Ancient Domain City after you arrive at the Ancient Battlefield. Especially the Enforcement Team. Please be sure to commit this to memory!”

Yang Ye’s expression couldn’t help but turn solemn when he heard this. It’s even able to make an existence like the Beast Emperor seem fearful! Exactly what sort of existence is that Enforcement Team?

Yang Ye pondered deeply for a moment before he asked. “Senior, what sort of team is that? Besides that, what’s the Ancient Domain City?”

“You don’t even know about Ancient Domain City, yet you dare to head to the Ancient Battlefield by yourself....” The Beast Emperor smiled and said, “Ancient Domain City is the one and only city on the Ancient Battlefield. Once you leave the territory of the Darkbeast Empire, the Ancient Domain City is the only city for an area of a few hundred thousand kilometers around the Ancient Battlefield! Ancient Domain City is a place one must pass in order to arrive at the Hidden Dragon Pagoda. So, all those monstrous geniuses that have come to seize Karmic Luck would choose to reside there for some time while waiting for the Hidden Dragon Pagoda to open! In other words, all the monstrous geniuses of the entire continent would make an appearance there during this period of time!”

“All the monstrous geniuses of the entire continent?” Yang Ye frowned and said, “Then wouldn’t Ancient Domain City be extremely chaotic?”

“Chaotic?” The Beast Emperor shook his head and said, “No it won’t! Because there’s order in the city, and the ones who maintain the order there are three Ninth Rank Sects of the central territory, an extraordinary demon beast clan of the demon territory, and a few extraordinary powers from the nether territory and devil territory! No one dares to act rashly there when it’s managed by these extraordinary powers!”

“Ninth Rank Sects?” Yang Ye frowned and said, “Senior, sects are divided by ranks as well?”

“Of course!” The Beast Emperor said, “Besides the southern territory, the sects of the other territories are divided by ranks. Perhaps you’re not aware of what being a Ninth Rank Sect represents. Allow me to explain, if the strongest sect in the southern territory, the Origin School, was placed in the central territory, then it would be a Third Rank Sect, and it might even be unable to be considered a Third Rank Sect!”

Yang Ye was shocked when he heard this. He hadn’t seen those Ninth Rank Sects, but he’d seen the Origin School. The strength that the Origin School revealed occasionally had already shocked him to the extreme. Not to mention that the Origin School had an extraordinary expert like Yuan Tian. However, even then, the Origin School could actually only be considered as a Third Rank Sect in the central territory....

How terrifying are Ninth Rank Sects?

“The world is extremely large!” The Beast Emperor gazed at Yang Ye and said, “It’s much larger than you’ve imagined. If you have the chance in the future, then travel the world. You’ll notice that we’re truly too tiny in this world. Besides that, it should be possible for you to join a good sect with the strength and potential you possess!”

Yang Ye chuckled. If he didn’t have to rescue his mother, then leaving the southern territory to visit the other territories wasn’t a bad idea. However, his mother was still suffering at the hands of the Flower Palace, so how could he possibly leave and head to the other territories?

Yang Ye shook his head and said, “Right, Senior, you told me not to offend the Enforcement Team just now. What sort of existence is the Enforcement Team that even Senior seems to be slightly afraid of them!?”

“The Enforcement Team was jointly established by those extraordinary powers!” The Beast Emperor had a slightly solemn expression as he said, “The objective of their establishment is to maintain the order in the Ancient Battlefield and the Ancient Domain City. Of course, their main objective is the fight for the Karmic Luck in the Hidden Dragon Pagoda. Which power wouldn’t want to take full possession of the Hidden Dragon Pagoda? However, everyone is clearly aware that not a single power in the continent is capable of seizing full possession of it! So, they had no choice but to join forces and take possession of it. As for the Hidden Dragon List, hahaha! It was merely something that was created to console those smaller powers!”

When he spoke up to here, the Beast Emperor glanced at Yang Ye and said in a low voice, “Kid, remember that you absolutely must not offend the Enforcement Team. Otherwise, you wouldn’t be able to survive no matter how many lives you possess! I’m not trying to scare you. Once you offend them, then you’ll definitely die even if you flee to the Origin School’s headquarters!”

“They are that formidable?” said Yang Ye in a surprised tone.

“The weakest member amongst them is at the Exalt Realm. What do you think?” said the Beast Emperor in a flat tone.

The corners of Yang Ye’s mouth twitched when he heard this. The weakest is at the Exact Realm.... That what about the strongest? Indeed, even the Beast Emperor would probably be unable to save him if such a force pursued him!

The Beast Emperor spoke slowly. “Right, even though there’s order in the city, the order there is unlike the Grand Qin Empire. The so-called order there is one where others shouldn’t harm the interests of those extraordinary powers! Moreover, everything there if governed by strength. In other words, so long as you don’t harm the interests of those extraordinary sects, then you should fight when you have to, and you should even strike lethally. Only in that way would you be able to reduce the amount of trouble you face!”

Yang Ye nodded, and then he said, “I’m naturally aware of that!” Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

When he spoke up to here, Yang Ye bowed once more to the Beast Emperor and said, “Senior, I’ll never forget the kindness you’ve shown me this time. If Senior needs any help from me in the future, then I’ll definitely not refuse so long as it’s within the scope of my ability!”

Repaying enmity with enmity and kindness with kindness, this was the principle which Yang Ye acted upon. Even though the Beast Emperor had mostly helped him because of the little fellow, he couldn’t erase the kindness that the Beast Emperor had shown him, and he had to repay it!

The Beast Emperor smiled and said, “You’re a loyal person that attaches great importance to his relationships. I believe you, and I believe the little fellow’s judgment. As for the thing I need your help with, I’ll tell you about it in the future. Your strength is still too low now, and you’re unable to be of help to me!”

Yang Ye nodded and said, “Since it’s like that, then Senior can come looking for me when you think I have the ability to accomplish it! If there’s nothing else, then I’ll be bidding my farewells!”

The Beast Emperor nodded and said, “I’ll send you there!” As soon as he finished speaking, the Beast Emperor waved his hand, and then Yang Ye instantly vanished on the spot....

As he gazed at the spot where Yang Ye vanished from, the Beast Emperor fell silent, and then he chuckled after a long time and said, “Founding Emperor! Oh! Founding Emperor! Old Geezer Zui as well! Both of your insides will definitely turn green from regret for giving up on this kid! How could he be an ordinary person when he is able to make a Spatial Mink which is an ancient variant beast follow him? Moreover, it’s even a Spatial Mink with violet pupils that’s rare to come by even in 10,000 years! The Enlightened Sword Heart? Haha! The Enlightened Sword Heart is nothing when compared to the mysteries hidden within him....”

As soon as he finished speaking, the Beast Emperor roared with laughter, and then his figure flashed and vanished on the spot.

......

After an unknown period of time, Yang Ye regained his consciousness, and then he shook his head and slowly opened his eyes. He was instantly shocked when he saw the scene before him. An extremely grand and enormous city was standing before him!

Why was it called an enormous city? Because the walls of the city were over a kilometer in height. As for their width, in any case, he wasn’t able to see the end of it even with the sight he possessed as an expert at the King Realm....

This ancient city could be said to be the grandest and most imposing city Yang Ye had ever laid eyes on, and even the Imperial Capital of the Grand Qin Empire couldn’t compare to it!

In next to no time, Yang Ye’s gaze descended towards the center of the ancient city because three words were inscribed there ‘Ancient Domain City’.

“Haha! Another newbie is here! Let’s see which entrance he’ll take from amongst the heaven, earth, man, and dog entrance. Will he take the man entrance or the dog entrance!?” Right when Yang Ye was shocked by the grandeur of the Ancient Domain City, a ridiculing voice had suddenly resounded from the side....
