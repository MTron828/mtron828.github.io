Chapter 2606 – Reversal!

Exploding blood!

At this moment, Yang Ye was stunned!

Because even he didn’t know why this was happening to him!

At this moment, despair filled Yang Ye’s heart. After all, if something happened to him at a time like this, wouldn’t it be absolutely fatal?

Yang Ye stood on the spot. No matter how hard the Primordial Pagoda tried, it couldn’t stop Yang Ye’s blood from exploding.

Finally, Yang Ye felt his consciousness become quite blurry.

Am I going to die just like this?

Suddenly, Yang Ye noticed that his blood hadn’t vanished upon exploding!

It hadn’t vanished!

Moreover, the exploded blood actually started to condense again!

“What’s going on? Yang Ye was shocked by this and bewilderment filled his mind!

It didn’t take long for his blood to condense once more, and then strands of terrifying energy surged from the powerful re-condensed blood and struck his body!

Bloodline Energy!

He knew this energy very well, it was just like Bloodline Energy. However, it was completely different. This Bloodline Energy was much, much stronger than before!

What’s going on?

Yang Ye was still quite bewildered!

Meanwhile, the powerful Bloodline Energy within him was growing increasingly stronger, and rays of blood red light started to surge from within him!

A long time passed like this before Yang Ye’s body started to tremble violently!

At this moment, he felt like a volcano that was about to erupt!

It was really quite uncomfortable!

Meanwhile, the Darkspawn in the surroundings started to show signs of attacking!

Because they seemed to have sensed the unusual changes in Yang Ye!

Many obscure auras gradually approached Yang Ye from all directions!

Yang Ye sensed them, but he didn’t dare to do anything right now!

Because he was afraid he would explode!

The terrifying Bloodline Energy within him was like a tide that surged incessantly within him!

Yang Ye gradually noticed that something was off!

Because the Bloodline Energy had started to madly stimulate his body!

It didn’t seem like it was trying to damage his body!

However, he was in a very bad situation right now!

A very, very bad situation!

Because the Darkspawn in the surroundings were getting closer and closer!

Yang Ye spoke solemnly, “Blood Bro, can you stop for a while?”

As soon as he said that, a miracle occurred. The blood within him suddenly stopped!

It really stopped!

Yang Ye was stunned once more!

The blood within him actually had a consciousness of its own?

Suddenly, a sharp tearing sound came from his right!

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly, and he stabbed his sword toward the right!

The Domain Sword!

Yang Ye’s body shook violently, but a shrill cry resounded on his right, and then countless strands of blood sprayed out into the surroundings!

An instant kill!

Yang Ye hadn’t used this move previously because it truly exhausted too much energy, and he really couldn’t exhaust too much strength here. But he had to do it now!

He had to deter the Darkspawn in the surroundings!

Sure enough, it had instantly killed the Darkspawn, and the others in the surroundings immediately retreated.

Fear!

At this moment, they were deeply afraid and even slightly terrified!

It was an instant kill!

Yang Ye ignored the Darkspawn in the surroundings and closed his eyes slowly, “Bro, you can start now!”

As soon as he said that, the blood within him started again.

Rumble!

Strands of energy fluctuating erupted from Yang Ye, and they rippled incessantly toward the surroundings!

At this moment, there were no Darkspawn left around Yang Ye!

It should be said that all the Darksapwn had gone far away from him!

This continued for a long time…

Boom!

A wave of powerful aura suddenly swept out from Yang Ye!

At this moment, Yang Ye’s blood suddenly calmed down!

The second grade of the Lord Realm!

At this moment, Yang Ye was a grade 2 Lord Realm expert!

Most importantly, his blood had been fully reversed!

Regardless of how strong Yang Ye’s ancestor had been, Yang Ye had reversed the bloodline of his Yang Clan’s ancestors, and so he possessed his own purest and newest version of the bloodline!

Now, he was the new ancestor of the Yang Clan!

The first benefit of the reversal was that the powerful Bloodline Energy instantly pushed him up a minor realm of cultivation. The second benefit was that a faint layer of blood had appeared around him!

It was like a barrier. As for its strength, he didn’t test it, but he would find out very soon.

Besides that, his body had attained the Lord Realm from the stimulation provided by his Bloodline Energy!

A body at the Lord Realm!

Moreover, the benefits of the reversal were far more than that!

Yang Ye sat down cross-legged and started using the Primordial Violet Energy to repair his body!

At this moment, he felt like he was full of energy!

It wasn’t the energy of the Sword Dao! It was the purest form of Bloodline Energy and physical strength!

He felt like a volcano, and every punch was like an eruption!

It felt really good!

Presently, he could be said to have no need for a sword when facing Lord Realm experts! He could blast them into bits with just his fists!

Confidence!

Unprecedented confidence!

One hour later, Yang Ye’s injuries had fully healed.

He stood up and walked off into the distance.

His view was pitch black, and without any concept of time or direction!

Yang Ye gradually started moving faster and faster. In the end, he was dashing forward. It didn’t take long for him to sense the aura of Darkspawn, and then a ray of sword energy that were invisible to the naked eye flashed through the air!

Hiss!

In the pitch black darkness of this world, the sound of something being sliced apart resounded, and then it was followed by a shrill and miserable cry!

Yang Ye was still shooting forward, but on his sword now!

He was chasing after the Darkspawn!

Now, the Darkspawns’ numbers were just numbers to him.

Presently, it wasn’t just his cultivation which had improved. His speed, strength, reaction, and attainments in the Sword Dao had experienced a qualitative increase too! It could be said that he could even fight a Destiny Realm expert right now!

As for these Lord Realm Darkspawn, they were no match for him!

A slaughter!

Yang Ye started to slaughter madly through the Darkspace!

Just like that, around two hours passed before Yang Ye suddenly stopped. It was because a beam of light had appeared before him!

A figure with an obscured face was standing within the beam of light.Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

This beam of light wasn’t affected or devoured by the dark matter in the Darkspace at all. Or it should be said that the dark matter moved aside upon coming into contact with it!

Yang Ye glanced at the figure within the beam of light and remained silent.

Suddenly, the figure waved its hand, and then Yang Ye’s sword involuntarily flew over to the beam of light!

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed, and then he tapped his finger forward. A ray of sword energy shot forward.

However, it hadn’t even gotten close to the figure before it vanished without a trace!

It had vanished without a trace!

Yang Ye’s pupils constricted, and then he took a step forward while a mysterious wave of energy enveloped the surroundings!

The Sword Domain!

However, as soon as his Sword Domain appeared, an invisible force overlapped onto his Sword Domain!

Yang Ye was stunned!

A Domain!

Yang Ye saw another Domain!

The mysterious Domain enveloped his Domain, and it was like shackles had been placed on his!

Yang Ye was shocked, and he was about to unleash his sword energy and sword intent when the figure in the beam of light spoke abruptly, “We’re not on the same level, so don’t do anything unnecessary.”

It was a female voice.

Yang Ye stopped and glanced at her, “You’re from the Darkspace?”

The mysterious woman replied indifferently, “The Dark Lord. This is the world I rule over.”

Yang Ye was stunned speechless.

Meanwhile, Executor flew back to him, and the Dark Lord spoke once more, “This sword had three masters in the past. Its second master was the ancient sword cultivator, Chen Xuanan; its third master was a sword cultivator of the Ancient Sword Sect, and now you are its fourth master!”

Yang Ye said, “What about its first master?”

The Dark Lord replied, “That was no man.”

Yang Ye wanted to pursue more answers, but the Dark Lord suddenly said, “You can leave now!”

Yang Ye spoke solemnly, “Is it because of her?”

He was naturally referring to Qi Bitian.

The Dark Lord fell silent for a short while and said, “You came here once, and she gave me something then and made an agreement with me. So long as you have no intention to invade the Darkspace, I must never act against you. Now, I won’t act against you. You can leave.”

Actually, she felt very helpless too!

Because if she didn’t show herself, Yang Ye would carry out a massacre here. None of the Darkspawn were a match for him!

That was why she had to send him out of here!

Yang Ye fell silent for a long time before he nodded, “Farewell.”

Suddenly, the Dark Lord tapped her finger forward, and a pitch black command token appeared before Yang Ye.

Yang Ye was puzzled, “What is this?”

The Dark Lord replied, “A proof of passage in the Darkspace! You can come and go as you please from now on!”

Yang Ye wasn’t on the same level as her right now, but it didn’t represent that it would always remain like that. She was actually making a display of goodwill because this command token could be used to escape death.

Yang Ye could enter the Darkspace if he encountered danger that was beyond him!

Yang Ye didn’t refuse this kindness. He put it away and said, “Thank you for sending me out of here.”

As soon as he finished speaking, a circle of light suddenly appeared beneath him, and then Yang Ye vanished!

Once Yang Ye vanished, the surroundings fell silent for a long time. In the end, the Dark Lord suddenly spoke softly, “Show yourself.”

As soon as she said that, a figure suddenly appeared where Yang Ye had been standing…
