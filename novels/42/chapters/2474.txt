Chapter 2475 – Destiny!

Nothing to say!

If the Eternal Kingdom had tried to negotiate properly with him, he would have been willing to talk about it. Yet now, it was too late!

Too late!

There was nothing left to say between him and Eternal Kingdom!

Yang Ye left the Eternal River and used the Myriad World Diagram to get to the Desolate World.

Because Huang Ying had permitted it, he could teleport there directly.

In the Desolate Hall, Yang Ye sat on a chair, and Huang Ying sat before him.

Huang Ying thought for a moment and said, “You wish to improve your body?”

Yang Ye nodded.

Huang Ying smiled, “Brother Yang, allow me to be honest, your body is at the World Lord Realm, and it’s actually very terrifying for a human’s body to be at this level. It’s quite difficult to improve further. Moreover, every realm you advance will probably induce indescribable pain upon you.”

Yang Ye shrugged, “It can’t be helped! Pain is better than death!”

Huang Ying hesitated for a moment and said, “Brother Yang, how about you stay here in my desolate race? Of course, I’m not asking you to help me and become my subordinate. We’re equals, friends, and we can strive for great things together!”

“Great things?” Yang Ye asked, “Subduing Eternal Kingdom?”

Huang Ying replied, “Sort of. Brother Yang, let me ask you something. Do you think there’s a greater universe beyond Eternal Kingdom?”

Yang Ye fell silent.

Eternal Kingdom was the largest and greatest known universe right now. Its civilization was the best as well. But were there other universes beyond it?

Yang Ye shook his head, “I’m not very interested in exploring the universe, nor am I interested in conquest. Moreover, you know sword cultivators like me are fond of freedom and the ability to do as we please. Of course, I’ll definitely take your side when it’s between the Eternal Kingdom and the desolate race. After all, I’m annoyed by them. However, I will take revenge in my own way!”

Huang Ying fell silent for a short while and said, “Brother Yang, you lack a little bit of righteousness and a sense of belonging. You don’t mind me saying that, right?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “I don’t!”

He didn’t because Huang Ying was correct.

Huang Ying walked over to the entrance of the hall, “Brother Yang, do you know that with the strength my ancestor possesses, he could abandon my desolate rate. Or it should be said that the desolate race is a burden for him. But he's still doing what he can for us. It’s the same for me. If it’s necessary, I’m willing to fight to the death for my desolate race. Because the Desolate World and the desolate race is our home, and it’s something we must protect.”

Yang Ye said, “Hey, get this through your head. It isn’t the Eternal Kingdom that’s trying to invade you, you’re trying to invade the Eternal Kingdom. I don’t think that’s very righteous, is it?”

Huang Ying shook his head and smiled, “Seriously!”

Yang Ye said, “Actually, there are many different types of righteousness, but the righteousness of most people is actually their own interests. Besides that, righteousness is usually just an excuse the winner uses. Absolute righteousness and fairness does not exist. Of course, there is good and bad in this world too. Anyway, it’s a very complicated thing, and I don’t want to explore it in detail.”

Huang Ying nodded. He was about to speak when he suddenly looked up at the sky, and then he gazed at Yang Ye, “The patriarch wishes to see you!”

The Desolate Emperor!

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly. The Desolate Emperor wishes to see me?

Yang Ye didn’t think too much about it and just nodded. A short while later, he was at the peak of a mountain.

A middle aged man with hair that hung loosely to his shoulder was seated cross-legged not too far away.

It was the Desolate Emperor!

The Desolate Emperor said, “We meet again!”

Yang Ye nodded, “You almost killed me that day!”

He walked over to the Desolate Emperor and sat by his side.

The Desolate Emperor asked, “You want to improve your body?”

Yang Ye nodded.

The Desolate Emperor said, “You’re suppressing your cultivation, and your body won’t be able to endure it once your cultivation erupts. So, you want to improve your body, right?”

Yang Ye nodded, “Can I?”

The Desolate Emperor replied, “You can. I can help you improve your body, but you must agree to a request of mine!”

Yang Ye asked, “Help the desolate race against Eternal Kingdom?”

The Desolate Emperor shook his head, “Kid, you think too highly of yourself.”

Yang Ye felt speechless.

The Desolate Emperor said, “Do you really think that you and that Sprite Progenitor who only knows how to be cute can fight against Eternal Kingdom? The Sprite Progenitor from all those years ago didn’t just possess a unique status. Anyway, you wouldn’t understand even if I told you. Both my desolate race and Eternal Kingdom can annihilate you and that cute little fellow with absolute ease!”

Yang Ye spoke indifferently, “Aren’t you exaggerating a little?”

“Exaggeration?” The Desolate Emperor chuckled, “Alright, let me ask you a question. If I wanted to kill you right now, do you think you could survive?”

Yang Ye fell silent.

That was impossible!

The Desolate Emperor added, “Let me ask you another question. If the Eternal Lord of Eternal Kingdom wants to kill you, he could pass through the Universe Wall and come to you. Would you be able to survive then?”

Yang Ye gazed at him, “Why doesn’t he do that?”

The Desolate Emperor asked, “Want to know?”

Yang Ye nodded.

The Desolate Emperor explained, “Because you’re beneath his notice. Tell me, would a king in the mortal world capture a thief? Of course he has better things to do!”

Yang Ye said, “So, it’s because I’m too weak?”

The Desolate Emperor shook his head, “Not entirely. The main reason is that his focus is on my desolate race. If it wasn’t for my desolate race, you would have died a long time ago!”

Yang Ye shook his head, “Senior, just be frank!”

The Desolate Emperor stood up and looked down. He could see the entire city from here.

He spoke softly, “You know what responsibility is, right?”

Yang Ye nodded.

He continued, “My responsibility is protecting the Desolate World and these people. As for why I invaded Eternal Kingdom all those years ago, I don’t want to speak about the real reason behind it because it won’t make a difference. My request is very simple. In the near future, for example, when I’m not here anymore, and the desolate race faces difficulties, you must help the desolate race. Even though you’re quite weak right now, it doesn’t mean you’ll remain like that forever!”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and replied, “Alright!”

Huang Ying was his friend, so he would naturally help if Huang Ying was in trouble.

The Desolate Emperor gazed at Yang Ye, “The reason I wanted to kill you in the Primal Battlefield is because you and the little fellow came into contact with that Sprite Progenitor. As far as I was concerned, you may be part of Eternal Kingdom. Since you were part of Eternal Kingdom, you stood on the opposite side of me, and so I wanted to kill you and spare myself of some future troubles. It’s normal, right? But now, since you’re Huang Ying’s friend, and your relationship with my desolate race isn’t bad, then one more friend is naturally better than another enemy.”

Yang Ye glanced at him, “You’re a little different from what I expected.”

A true expert!

This man before him was certainly one of the strongest existences in this world, but the man felt no different than other ordinary people. He didn’t seem high and mighty, nor did he have a sense of superiority!

He was just a very ordinary person!

That was Yang Ye’s impression!

The Desolate Emperor glanced at Yang Ye, “Actually, I really envy all of you.”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Huh?”

The Desolate Emperor grinned, “Because all of you know nothing, and at most times, ignorance is bliss. Haha…”

As soon as he finished speaking, he waved his right hand and vanished on the spot with Yang Ye.

A short while later, they arrived high above in space.

It was unlike any point in space he’d been to. It wasn’t just different from the space he was used to, it wasn’t like the space in any other world. What was different about it? He couldn’t put a finger on it. In any case, it was strange, very strange.

The Desolate Emperor suddenly asked, “It feels very strange?”

Yang Ye nodded, “The space here…”

The Desolate Emperor grinned, “Do you know how many types of space exist?”

Yang Ye replied, “There are many types of space?”

The Desolate Emperor smiled, “What else? The world we reside in is called the Three-Dimensional Space. Do you know what that is?”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

The Desolate Emperor shook his head, “I’m sure you don’t. You haven’t arrived at that level yet.”

Yang Ye hurriedly bowed respectfully, “Senior, please enlighten me!”

He didn’t know, but he could learn!

The man before him was one of the supreme experts of this world, so he would never get another opportunity like this!𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

The Desolate Emperor thought for a while and said, “Presently, there are many known types of space, but there are only two that are closest to us. The first is Three-Dimensional Space, the world we live in.”

Yang Ye asked, “What about the second?”

The Desolate Emperor grinned, “Four-Dimensional Space!”

“Four-Dimensional Space?” Yang Ye frowned slightly, “What is that?”

The Desolate Emperor glanced at him and said, “We call it Destiny! The living beings in that space transcend everything we know, so they are Destiny. You cannot sense it now because you’re too weak. Your strength and mind are not at the peak of the Three-Dimensional Space. Once your mind, knowledge, and strength are at its peak, you will be able to sense the existence of Four-Dimensional Space, Destiny.”

Yang Ye spoke solemnly, “Senior, it’s getting a little complicated!”

The Desolate Emperor spoke indifferently, “It should be. You’re still far away from it, so take it slow!”

Yang Ye said, “However, something still puzzles me. According to what you said, Destiny is in the Four-Dimensional Space, but that has nothing to do with us! They are in the Four-Dimensional Space while we are in the Three-Dimensional Space. Isn’t it great if we just mind our own business?”

The Desolate Emperor gazed at Yang Ye for a long time and said, “Are you an idiot?! You know, living beings like plants and ants live in the One-Dimensional Space and Two-Dimensional Space. Let me ask you something, can they dictate their own fate? Perhaps the slightest mistake by a human like accidentally stomping on a blade of grass or an ant would put an end to their lives. Understand?”

Yang Ye was stunned.
