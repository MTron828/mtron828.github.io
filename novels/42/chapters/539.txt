Chapter 540 – Saint Liu Yun’s True Intentions!

Yang Ye’s heart shook when he noticed Saint Liu Yun’s killing intent, and he hurriedly said, “Senior, I’d like to inherit Senior’s mantle. I hope Senior will fulfil my wish.”

An Nanjing intended to say something but Yang Ye grabbed her hand, and then he smiled and said, “An Nanjing, you’ve inherited the inheritances of so many Martial Gods, so allow me to have this senior’s inheritance, alright?”

An Nanjing gazed at him for a short while before she nodded, but there was a trace of bewilderment in her eyes.

The killing intent in Saint Liu Yun’s eyes dispersed when he heard Yang Ye, and then he put on a smile again and said, “Kid, even though your strength isn’t bad, and even your potential is good, but you’re much more inferior to this little girl. To be honest, I don’t want my mantle to be passed down to a mediocre person. Even though you aren’t mediocre, someone else is more outstanding that you, understand?”

Yang Ye nodded and said, “What if I possess the Enlightened Sword Heart?”

“The Enlightened Sword Heart?” The expressions of the old man in Daoist robes and Saint Liu Yun changed slightly. Saint Liu Yun floated over to Yang Ye and stared at him for a short while before he exclaimed with admiration. “It really is the Enlightened Sword Heart. I never expected that you were actually able to attain the Enlightened Sword Heart at such a young age. Kid, if it’s in terms of natural talent, then you can be ranked in the top 10 of all the sword cultivators I’ve known!”

“Kid, why didn’t you tell me that you possessed the Enlightened Sword Heart?” The old man spoke with slight anger. This fellow was actually still concealing his ability.

“You didn’t ask!” Yang Ye shrugged innocently.

The old man was exasperated.

Saint Liu Yun glanced at Yang Ye, and then he glanced at An Nanjing while a trace of hesitation appeared in his eyes. A short while passed before he shook his head in the end. “Kid, even though you possess the Enlightened Sword Heart, you’re still slightly inferior to this little girl. So, I still intend to give my inheritance to this little girl.

Right at this moment, Yang Ye took a step forward, and then a mysterious energy appeared around all of them. The expressions on the faces of Saint Liu Yun and the old man changed drastically upon sensing this mysterious energy.

“Sword Domain! This is the Sword Domain! You’ve actually comprehended the Sword Domain!” The old man pointed a finger at Yang Ye while he spoke in a slightly trembling voice.

Besides surprise, there was also excitement and happiness in Saint Liu Yun’s eyes.

Yang Ye glanced at the two of them while a wisp of killing intent flashed through the depths of his eyes. These two fellows are definitely not good people.

Even though he didn’t have any proof, his intuition told him that there was definitely something off about them. Moreover, the Sword Spirit had given him a warning that the two of them were absolutely not kind people. All of these were the reasons why he’d stopped An Nanjing from receiving the inheritance!

He wanted to attack now, but the facts of the situation told him that while they were both affected by his Sword Domain, it wasn’t very strong. He knew that he wouldn’t be able to pose much of a threat to them even if he utilized his Sword Domain at its full strength.

Monarch Realm experts were really not existences which Monarch Realm experts could resist!

Yang Ye withdrew the killing intent in his heart and said sincerely, “Senior, I sincerely desire to inherit your mantle, so please fulfil my wish. Even though I don’t dare to speak about surpassing Senior’s accomplishments from all those years ago, I guarantee that I will absolutely not bring shame to Senior’s name.”

“Alright!” Saint Liu Yun didn’t hesitate at all this time. Even though An Nanjing had comprehended 6 Intents, they were only Intents in the end. Yang Ye, on the other hand, had comprehended a Domain which reigned supreme over Intents, and Yang Ye was even a man, so he naturally intended to choose Yang Ye.

An Nanjing glanced at Saint Liu Yun, glanced at Yang Ye, and intended to say something. However, Yang Ye tightened his grip on her hand, and then glanced at her while smiling. “You wouldn’t fight me for it, right?”

An Nanjing gazed at Yang Ye and didn’t say anything.

Yang Ye said, “Don’t worry, you know me. I never do anything I’m not confident at. I’m confident in my ability to receive this senior’s inheritance.”

Meanwhile, Saint Liu Yun said, “Don’t worry Little Girl. Even though you can’t obtain my inheritance, I still won’t treat you unfairly. Head over to the treasury and take a few treasures later. There are even some Dao Artifacts there.” As he spoke, he glanced at the old man and said, “Little Tu, take her to the treasure to choose a few things!”

The old man nodded, and then he gazed at An Nanjing and said, “Let’s leave and not disturb them.”

An Nanjing took a deep and long glance at Yang Ye before she left with the old man.

“I never expected that you would actually be so loyal to your love and are actually willing to sacrifice yourself to save that little girl!” Saint Liu Yun smiled as he spoke to Yang Ye.

“You’re finally showing your true self?” Yang Ye stared Saint Liu Yun in the eye. So he saw through my intentions since the beginning. As expected of a Saint Realm expert. Yang Ye’s heart felt even heavier.

“I’m very curious, how did you know that I had ill intent towards the two of you?” Saint Liu Yun said, “Truthfully speaking, I feel that I didn’t give myself away in the slightest, so why were both you and that little girl so vigilant against me? Especially you. You even revealed killing intent towards me when you executed your Sword Domain just now. I’m really curious!”

Yang Ye said, “Actually, I’m very curious as well. You’re just a strand of soul now, so why act against us? Even if you intended to take control of our bodies, a strand of soul is probably insufficient to accomplish that, right? Since you can’t, then what’s your true objective? You’ll satisfy my curiosity since I’m about to die, right?”

“What an interesting kid!” Saint Liu Yun smiled and said, “You actually guessed that I’m going to take control of your body.”

“Why?” asked Yang Ye.

Saint Liu Yun took a deep breath, and then his translucent and ethereal body grew denser and denser before Yang Ye. It wasn’t long before Saint Liu Yun’s figure had gradually materialized to a seemingly completely material state.

“You’re not dead!” Yang Ye suppressed the shock in his heart and spoke in a low voice. A Saint Realm expert.... A living Saint Realm expert. Not to mention Yang Ye, even any other person in the world would probably be shocked by this.

“You’re wrong!” Saint Liu Yun waved his right hand, and then the body beneath him instantly transformed into dust. “I suffered a surprise attack from two Saint Realm experts over 10,000 years ago. My physical body was completely destroyed while my soul was almost obliterated as well. Fortunately, I was saved by my benefactor, and my damaged soul was preserved. After that, I hid here and recuperated for over 10,000 years before my soul was finally repaired. Now, all I lack is a physical body, a physical body that can endure the strength of my soul. You’re very suitable for that role!”

“So that’s why!” Yang Ye said, “So you’re just in soul form right now?”

Saint Liu Yun smiled and said, “I understand your intentions, but I might as well tell you that while I am in soul form and without a physical body to reside in, and even though my strength isn’t at the Saint Realm and not even at the Half-Saint Realm. But I wasn’t lying just now. It’s still extremely easy for me to kill a Monarch Realm expert. Even though you’re a true monstrous genius right now, you have no chance of winning!”

Saint Liu Yun paused for a moment and continued. “Actually, you really pleasantly surprised me. If it wasn’t for you, then I would probably have a huge amount of trouble to deal with. Even though that little girl isn’t a match for me, she has an ancestor at the ninth rank of the Monarch Realm. If it was in the past, then dealing with such a profounder would only take a wave of my hand. But now... profounders at such a realm of cultivation are still quite a threat to me. Fortunately, you were here, so I don’t have to take the risk and seize that little girl’s body!”

“One last question!” Yang Ye said, “You might be the only Saint Realm expert in this world now. Even though you aren’t really one now, you were in the past. I want to know why new Saint Realm experts haven’t been born in the world? Moreover, why do we need to overcome the Heavenpath in order to become Saint Realm experts?”

“Attaining the Saint Realm requires a huge amount of spirit energy. Besides the spirit energy of the heavens and the earth, a form of energy called Primordial Violet Energy is needed as well. The continent used to have that energy, but there’s probably none now. The reason one can become a Saint Realm expert after overcoming the Heavenpath is because Primordial Violet Energy exists in the world outside. So, overcoming the Heavenpath would allow one to obtain Primordial Violet Energy and attain the Saint Realm!” said Saint Liu Yun.

“Who’s controlling the Heavenpath?” asked Yang Ye. This was one of the questions he cared about the most. Because it was related to his future, and he had to find out about the enemies he would face in the future.

Saint Liu Yun said, “Would you resist if someone came over to steal from your home? There is no right and wrong in this world, and there’s only strong and weak. The spirit energy in the continent has become scarce to its lowest point in history. Do you know why the Martial God, Sword Emperor, and Mortal Emperor have all appeared now? If I’m not wrong, then this world is making its last stand.”

“What do you mean?” asked Yang Ye.

Saint Liu Yun said, “The strength of the profounders in Profounder Continent is weakening. Since there are no Saint Realm experts here, the arrival of a single Saint Realm expert from the outside world would be able to destroy our entire continent. Under such circumstances, the world would naturally feel threatened. So, it’s making its last stand by sacrificing most to help a few, so that those few would be able to open up the Heavenpath or even destroy it. In that way, this world would be linked to the outside world, and it would obtain new life. Unfortunately, it might not be able to obtain its wish!” Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“The world is controlling our lives?” Yang Ye frowned and said, “The world is a ‘person’ as well?”

“Everything has a spirit!” Saint Liu Yun said, “Alright, we’ve spoken enough. I presume you can die in peace now. I advise you not to resist. Because it would only be in vain and increase your suffering. Just cooperate well with me and I’ll let you vanish swiftly.”

Yang Ye nodded and said, “Bring it!”

Saint Liu Yun grinned and said, “What a sensible little fellow. Don’t worry, I won’t make your death too painful.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Saint Liu Yun transformed into a wisp of light that directly entered Yang Ye’s body.
