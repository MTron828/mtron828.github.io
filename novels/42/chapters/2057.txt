Chapter 2058 – Who the Fuck is That?!

They were here to rob them!

Yang Ye had instantly understood what was going on. They were about to be robbed.

Li Shui’shui laughed coldly, “You know we’re from the Martial Emperor Academy, yet you still dare to act against us. You’re quite brave!”

“Is the Martial Emperor Academy that great?” The black robed man laughed coldly, “I must admit that it’s extraordinary, but it doesn’t represent that all of you are extraordinary. Moreover, based on my knowledge of the academy, if its students suffer any mishaps in the outside world, the academy won’t interfere at all. I wonder if I’m right!”

Li Shui’shui spoke coldly, “Are you that confident?”

The black robed man pointed at them and said, “If I’m not wrong, you’re in the Earth Class at most, right?”

Yang Ye gazed at Li Shui’shui, “The Earth Class?”

Li Shui’shui explained, “There’s the Sky Class, Earth Class, Spirit Class, and Mortal Class in the academy. Every single class is further divided into Group A, B, C, and D. Wo You and I are from Group B.”

Yang Ye spoke softly, “I didn’t know that.”

As he spoke, he looked up at the black robed man and said, “If I’m not wrong, you’re here for Originite too. However, Originite is more far out of reach for the two of you, and robbing people works better. Right?” nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

The black robed man smiled, “Yes. If luck gives me one, then I’ll take it, but the people here…”

Suddenly, Yang Ye waved his hand, “I’m not interested in wasting my breath with you.”

As soon as he finished speaking, a sword appeared above his palm, and then a ray of light flashed.

At the moment a sword appeared above Yang Ye’s palm, the black robed man’s expression had changed drastically, and there was an extremely solemn expression in his eyes. Meanwhile, a ray of cold light had arrived before him.

“Defend!” Suddenly, a clear and melodious voice resounded, and then a thin green barrier of light appeared before the black robed man’s forehead. The tip of the sword stabbed against the barrier of light, causing it to sink in. However, it wasn’t destroyed and even bounced Yang Ye’s sword away.

Yang Ye frowned and gazed at the woman, “You’re from the spirit race!”

The woman glanced at Yang Ye and remained silent, but vigilance covered her face.

Yang Ye gazed at the black robed man and was about to attack, but the black robed man suddenly said, “Wait!”

“Hmm?” Yang Ye asked, “What?”

The black robed man suddenly asked, “Are you Yang Ye?”

A wisp of surprise flashed through Yang Ye’s eyes, “How did you know?”

A trace of shock flashed through both the man and the woman’s eyes when they heard Yang Ye admit it.

The black robed man laughed bitterly, “So it really is you. We’re from the spirit race.”

The spirit race!

Yang Ye came to an understanding now. Besides the Weapon Path, he wasn’t really famous in the other three paths, let alone Martial Emperor Academy. However, his reputation among the other races was huge. Did anyone among the other races not know Yang Ye?

Meanwhile, the black robed man cupped his fist at Yang Ye, “We apologize for what just happened. Brother Yang, we hope you can let bygones be bygones.”

Li Shui’shui’s eyes were filled with bewilderment when she witnessed this.

Isn’t this a little too strange?

She gazed at Yang Ye, Is he very famous among all the races?

Yang Ye glanced at the black robed man. While the black robed man was apologizing, he seemed very vigilant and was afraid that Yang Ye would attack abruptly.

Suddenly, the black robed man added, “I have a piece of information that Brother Yang may be interested in! There’s a ruin over 100,000km away from here, and it’s very likely for Originite to be there.”

Li Shui’shui suddenly asked, “Then why haven’t both of you gone there?”

The man laughed bitterly, “Some people already have their eyes on that place, so going there without sufficient strength is no different than seeking death.” He gazed at Yang Ye and continued, “I’m not trying to draw disaster upon you, but your strength should be sufficient to get something out of it.”

Li Shui’shui gazed at Yang Ye, “Do you want to go?”

Yang Ye nodded, “Let’s go have a look.”

Li Shui’shui pointed at the black robed man and the woman, “What about them?”

Yang Ye grinned, “What do you want to do to them?”

She thought for a moment and replied, “Up to you.”

Yang Ye smiled, “Let’s go!”

Kill them? If he used his full strength, he would naturally be able to accomplish that. However, he would definitely have to pay a price. Especially the woman in a green dress, her strength wasn’t ordinary. So, it didn’t benefit him to fight them to the death.

Moreover, he didn’t really trust Wo You and Li Shui’shui, so he didn’t want to expose too many of his trump cards before them.

The black robed man and the woman watched as Yang Ye and the others vanished into the distance.

The black robed man spoke solemnly, “I didn’t expect him to be here!”

The woman spoke softly, “He has joined Martial Emperor Academy!”

The black robed man laughed bitterly, “Our patriarch told us not to offend that malevolent existence, but I didn’t really take him seriously. Now I know that our patriarch was right. That fellow’s strength is unfathomable. Luckily, I recognized him just now. Otherwise, we may be dead by now.”

She asked, “Shall we go?”

The man shook his head, “Of course we can’t just go. Chaos is about to descend upon the world. We must try to get an Originite no matter what. Only an Originite can help our spirit race grow even stronger, and only then can we survive in the chaotic world that is about to come.”

The woman frowned slightly, “Is a single Originite that powerful?”

The man replied solemnly, “It isn’t just an Originite, it’s an inheritance, an inheritance from a greater civilization. Otherwise, the Sages and those extremely old experts wouldn’t attach such importance to the Prehistoric Ruins!”

He looked up at the sky and continued, “Come on, let’s go try our luck.”

They vanished on the spot once he finished speaking.

“Were you very famous in the past?” Li Shui’shui kept asking Yang Ye questions, causing him to have quite the headache.

Li Shui’shui asked another question, “Why did you come to Martial Emperor Academy and take the insignificant position of a librarian?”

Yang Ye stopped, looked at Li Shui’shui’s eyes which were filled with curiosity, and then he said, “It’s my own personal business, alright?”

Yang Ye turned around and walked away once he finished speaking.

He didn’t have a good impression of Li Shui’shui, and he even felt a little aversion instead. She hadn’t held back at all when she attacked him that day, and any other ordinary person would have died that day.

But she’d tried to take his life just for a small thing.

Li Shui’shui was livid when she saw Yang Ye act like that. She glared angrily at Yang Ye and said, “You think you’re so great?”

Wu You tugged Li Shui’shui’s arm gently and said, “He’s not a kind person. Don’t get too close to him, and don’t get into conflict with him.”

Li Shui’shui grunted coldly, “I don’t want to get close to him. I was just curious.”

Wo You spoke softly, “Don’t forget our objective!”

Li Shui’shui’s expression eased up quite a bit, “Of course I remember! Let’s go!”

An hour later, they stopped.

There was a huge circular building in front of Yang Ye and the others. It was round and extremely huge. It wasn’t on the ground, it was floating in the air, and it seemed like an octopus.

“What the heck is that?” Yang Ye frowned.

Li Shui’shui spoke softly, but she didn’t sound very confident, “The residence of people from the prehistoric civilization?”

Yang Ye suddenly looked towards the distance. There was a huge statue there. It was over 30m tall, and it had its arms crossed while looking down slightly.

“Come, let’s go over and have a look!” As soon as she finished speaking, Li Shui’shui’s figure shot forward.

Yang Ye followed her, and it only took a moment for them to arrive before the huge statue. There was a round platform at the bottom of the statue, and it was holding up the entire statue. Besides that, it was covered in some strange symbols.

Wo You spoke softly, “That should be their writing system!”

Yang Ye nodded and said, “Are you able to read them?”

Li Shui’shui rolled her eyes at Yang Ye, “What do you think?”

Yang Ye ignored her and gazed at the giant statue. It looked slightly like a human, but it was absolutely not human. Because while it had the shape of a human, its nose, ears, and even hands and feet were different from humans.

Is this how the people of the prehistoric civilization looked like? Yang Ye frowned slightly and felt quite curious and puzzled. He was curious about why such an advanced civilization vanished into the annals of history.

Meanwhile, Li Shui’shui suddenly said, “Let’s go in and have a look!”

Yang Ye was about to speak when he suddenly looked towards the side. A young man had suddenly appeared there, and he was looking at them with a strange grin on his face.

His grin made all of them feel quite uncomfortable.

It was like a hunter eyeing his prey!

The man suddenly asked, “Want to go in?”

Yang Ye nodded, “Indeed!”

The man chuckled, and then he pointed at Li Shui’shui and Wo You, “Make them accompany me for a night, and I’ll let all of you in. Alright?”

Li Shui’shui and Wo You’s faces fell when they heard this.

The man chuckled, “So? Of course, I won’t refuse if you want to be with me for two nights instead of one. Haha…”

Suddenly, Li Shui’shui pointed at Yang Ye, “Do you know who he is?”

The man gazed at Yang Ye.

Li Shui’shui spoke in an extremely serious tone, “He’s Yang Ye, you know? He’s Yang Ye!”

“Yang Ye?” The man frowned slightly, “Who the fuck is that? I’ve never heard of him!”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.
