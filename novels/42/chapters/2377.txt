Chapter 2378 – Eat the Dragon!

Nanli Meng’s face twitched when she heard him, and she acted like she didn’t know him.

Treasures!

Even if you wanted them, you can’t be that direct, right?

The middle aged man glanced at Yang Ye and smiled, and then he flicked a mirror over to Yang Ye.

Yang Ye hurriedly asked, “What’s this?”

“The True Energy Mirror!” The middle aged man explained, “It has a formation, and it can reflect energy. If you use it in battle, once the energy of your opponent strikes it, all of the energy will be reflected back.”

Yang Ye hurriedly asked, “All of it?”

The middle aged man shook his head, “It can reflect 70%, and if you can’t deal with the remaining 30%, then it’s obvious your opponent’s strength far surpasses your own.”

70%!

Yang Ye nodded. That wasn’t bad either.

As if she knew what he was thinking, Nanli Meng suddenly said, “Be content with what you have! Even a Three World Realm expert won’t be able to defeat you now.”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and realized that it did make sense. If it could reflect 70%, it represented that his opponent was only fighting him with 30% of his or her strength!

Yang Ye’s eyes lit up when he thought of this.

“Remember!” Meanwhile, the middle aged man suddenly said, “Using that formation requires a huge amount of spirit energy. Based on your current strength, you can only use it once at most!”

Spirit energy?

Yang Ye was stunned. He was about to speak when Snowy suddenly opened her eyes. She gazed at the mirror, and her eyes immediately lit up.

Snowy embraced the mirror and knocked it with her paw, causing clear and resounding clangs to come from it.

Snowy blinked, and then blew on it.

Countless strands of spirit energy instantly surged into it. In an instant, the mirror shook violently, and then a thin layer of light appeared around it. It was very beautiful.

Snowy gazed at Yang Ye, and then she pointed at the mirror.

Yang Ye smiled, “It’s yours!”

Snowy cracked a smile and went into the Primordial Pagoda with it.

Meanwhile, the middle aged man spoke softly, “Looks like spirit energy isn’t an issue for you.”

Yang Ye smiled and didn’t say anything. He really didn’t have to worry about spirit energy while he had Snowy with him.

The middle aged man gazed at Nanli Meng, hesitated for a moment, and then sent a ray of white light in her direction, “Within it is some information about the Primal Era! It should be useful to you!”

Nanli Meng bowed slightly to him, “Thank you!” And then she put the white light away.

Meanwhile, the middle aged man added, “I left this last strand of vitality to wait for a successor. Unfortunately, after so many years, no one has come here. As for the both of you, none of you are suitable to be my successor.”

He flipped his palm, and a black scroll appeared there. He sent it over to Nanli Meng, “If you encounter someone who isn’t bad, then give it to that person. Everything I know is in there.”

She hesitated for a moment and nodded, “I’ll do my best!”

The man grinned, “Go on!”

Nanli Meng glanced at him, and his body had started to turn ethereal. An instant later, his body vanished!

Nanli Meng and Yang Ye bowed slightly before leaving.

They searched around, and it didn’t take long for them to find the corpse of the woman’s husband. It hadn’t rotted. After all, he’d been an extraordinary expert in the past. Just like that, they brought the corpse back to the forest.

In the forest, she gazed at the corpse for a long time, and then she looked at Yang Ye and flicked a black seal to him.

The Seal of Suppression!

Yang Ye didn’t hesitate to take it.

She said indifferently, “Leave!”

Yang Ye glanced at her, hesitated for a moment, and said, “Senior, the dead cannot be resurrected. I hope you can get through this and…”

“You know nothing!” Suddenly, she looked him in the eyes, “Get out now!”

Yang Ye’s face stiffened, and then he shook his head and left.

Nanli Meng glanced at her and just walked away without saying anything.

Meanwhile, the woman suddenly said, “Don’t go right after you leave the forest. The center of the battlefield is over there. If you encounter anything there, your strengths are probably insufficient to keep you alive.”

She took the corpse and walked off into the depths of the forest once she finished speaking.

By a tomb deep within the forest. There were two names on the tomb.

She placed the man’s corpse into the uncovered casket. Suddenly, she gazed at his right hand, and he was holding something tightly in it. It was a strand of hair.

Tears surged from her eyes when she saw the hair, and she hugged him tightly.

All those years ago. High above in the clouds, he held her hand as she looked him in the eyes, “Can you not go?”

He shook his head, “My brothers are all there, and the Monarch needs us.’

She really wanted to ask him to take her with him, but she couldn’t. Because she was very weak, and she had no right to interfere in a battle of that level.

He released her and said, “Wait for me, wait for my return!”

He turned around and was about to leave.

Meanwhile, she grabbed his hand and placed her hair within it. She said softly, “I’ll wait for you.”

He nodded slightly and vanished into the boundless sky.

This parting was eternal.

Before the tomb, she gazed at the man in the casket, and a smile curled up on her face, “We couldn’t be together in life, but we can be together in death!”

She entered the casket.

It closed, and so did the tomb.

…

Outside the forest, Yang Ye spoke softly, “Have you ever liked someone?”

Nanli Meng glanced at him and said, “Like someone? Sorry, allow me to be honest but it’s better to like a dog than to like a man. At the very least, a dog won’t betray you, right?”

Yang Ye didn’t know what to say in response.

She gently combed her hair behind her ears, “Women can only become truly strong if they do not love anyone. Because once they fall for someone, their minds deteriorate. Moreover, the words of most men cannot be trusted. Of course, their words can be trusted before they sleep with the woman. Before they sleep together, he will do anything she says, but once they do sleep together. Hah!”

Yang Ye shook his head, “You win!”

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings, “Shall we go outside now?”

She glanced to the right, “She said that the center of the battlefield is over there. It’s very dangerous, but it’s definitely filled with fortune too.”

She gazed at Yang Ye.

But Yang Ye shook his head.

“What?” She smiled, “Afraid?”

Yang Ye replied softly, “I’m satisfied with what I’ve already gained.”

He glanced to the right and continued, “People should always…”

Suddenly, Snowy appeared.

Yang Ye gazed at her, and she looked to the right. There was a trace of bewilderment in her eyes.

Yang Ye asked softly, “What is it?”

Snowy pointed to the right, and then she started waving her paws.

Something familiar!

Snowy was telling him that she sensed a familiar aura, and she wanted to go over there.

A familiar aura!

Yang Ye glanced to the right and said, “You really want to go?”

Snowy glanced to the right and nodded again.

Yang Ye thought for a moment and replied, “Alright, then we’ll go.”

Yang Ye gazed at Nanli Meng, “What about you?”

She smiled brilliantly, “Of course I’m coming.”

Yang Ye nodded, “Then let’s do this.”

They didn’t head over immediately because it was getting dark, so they found a place to camp for the night.

They hadn’t met many people since coming here, but all they met were very, very strong. Especially the old man with a bamboo chest on his back, and that Primal Emperor. Even though he seemed very amiable, the Primal Emperor actually possessed terrifying strength. If he’d wanted to kill them, then both he and Nanli Meng wouldn’t be able to survive!

Yang Ye glanced at Nanli Meng who was seated cross-legged at the side and entered the Primordial Pagoda.

In the Primordial Pagoda, Yang Ye and Snowy went to a mountain. It was Erya’s mountain. She’s asked Su Qingshi to construct a palace for her too. But it wasn’t huge, it was tiny even.

In the palace, Erya was seated cross-legged on the ground with her eyes closed.

Once Yang Ye and Snowy arrived, she opened her eyes and cracked a smile.

Yang Ye walked over to Erya and spoke softly, “Erya, Qingshi said you haven’t been yourself lately. What’s wrong?”

She gazed at him, “Big Brother Yang, I may be about to advance!”

Yang Ye was delighted, “That’s a good thing!”

She blinked, “I want to eat that dragon!”

Yang Ye was stunned speechless.

Snowy blinked, glanced at Yang Ye, and then gazed at Erya.

Yang Ye gazed at Erya for a long time before he said, “Are you serious?”

She nodded, “I really want to eat it. But I know doing that is wrong.”

Yang Ye sighed and walked over to her. He rubbed her head and said, “What’s going on? Can you explain it to me?”

She hesitated for a moment and told him about devouring the Primal Dragon Croc.

Something worth mentioning was that she’d advanced to the World Lord Realm after digesting it!

Yang Ye fell silent.

She wanted to eat the Primal True Dragon. Not because she wanted to use it to improve her strength, and it was because of her nature. Her nature was urging her to eat it. Not just the Primal True Dragon, if she hadn’t treated Oxxy as a friend, she would probably want to eat Oxxy too.

Meanwhile, Sword Scroll appeared in front of Yang Ye. She gazed at Erya and said, “Her nature is gradually awakening.”

She gazed at Yang Ye and continued, “Tell that dragon to stay far away from her!”

Yang Ye was stunned speechless.Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m
