Chapter 2689 – All Gone!

The Martial Sky Invulnerable Body!

Yang Ye was very interested, but he had to slow down for now.Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Yang Ye returned to the Primordial Pagoda.

He had some things to do!

At a mountain range in the pagoda.

Yang Ye, Erya, and Snowy arrived at an empty area. Erya sat cross-legged, and the inner core fragment was in her grasp!

Erya wanted to consume it!

Because Yang Ye wasn’t in danger anymore, and she needed to improve her strength.

Erya glanced at Yang Ye and Snowy, and then she smiled, “Big Brother Yang, Snowy, don’t worry. I’ll be back playing with both of you really soon.”

Yang Ye shookhis head and smiled.

Erya was still just a child!

Snowy nodded from Yang Ye’s shoulder, and then she waved her hand. She was telling Erya to be careful!

Yang Ye went over to Erya and rubbed her head, “Be careful. Immediately notify me if you face any difficulties, alright?”

She nodded.

Just like that, Yang Ye and Snowy watched as she swallowed the fragment.

As soon as it entered her, Erya closed her eyes, and then the space around her started trembling.

An hour later, Yang Ye left with Snowy once he confirmed that everything was going smoothly.

He’d planned to play with Snowy, but Snowy had ran off to the wooden house where the woman in black had once resided.

Cultivating!

She wanted to cultivate!

Even though the woman in black wasn’t here to monitor her, but after the string of events from before, she had a stronger feeling that she should become a little stronger!

Moreover, the mysterious profound energy that the woman in white left behind within her, the Past Life Energy, and the Eternal Energy of the past were all things she had to absorb and use well. Besides that, there was the Sprite Domain. She wasn’t very skilled at its use yet!

Yang Ye was naturally quite surprised by Snowy’s actions. After all, she was usually so playful, yet now, she was actually taking the initiative to cultivate!

While he was surprised, Yang Ye supported her decision.

If the little fellow didn’t cultivate well, it would truly be a waste of her natural gifts.

Yang Ye sat cross-legged in the cultivation room and didn’t disturb Snowy. He withdrew the Past Life Pearl and swallowed it. As soon as it entered him, he sensed a strand of mysterious energy appear within him.

Or to be more precise, it was a strand of mysterious profound energy!

Past Life Profound Energy!

Past Life Profound Energy wasn’t the same as Past Life Energy. He has to first master Past Life Profound Energy, and only then could he master Past Life Energy.

The sword, Past Life, required Past Life Energy to reach its full potential!

Even though Yang Ye’s attainments in the Sword Dao couldn’t be compared to the past, Past Life and Past Life Energy were still extremely useful to him.

A new form of energy that could be added to his Sword Dao.

Yang Ye sensed the energy carefully. Once the energy entered him, it had started to permeate his entire body.

Nourishment!

He noticed that the Past Life Profound Energy was nourishing his entire body.

It was a truly nice feeling!

Just like that, a long time passed before some energy started to surge around Yang Ye.

Meanwhile, Snowy awoke from her cultivation.

She glanced at Yang Ye who was still cultivating, blinked, and then flew over to Yang Ye. She put her paws on Yang Ye’s face, and then rubbed her head against his chest. Once she was done, she turned around and left.

Cultivation was necessary, but so was playing!

A balance was necessary!

A few days later, Snowy returned to Yang Ye. She hugged him and rubbed her head against him, and then she returned to the wooden house to cultivate!

In the Primordial Pagoda, Su Qingshi and the others were actually not slacking off. All of them were cultivating.

Cultivating!

All of them were cultivators. While they were with Yang Ye, it didn’t represent that they didn’t have to cultivate. Conversely, they worked harder than they ever had!

On this day, Su Qingshi suddenly came to the cultivation room.

A wisp of gentle emotions flashed through her eyes as she gazed at Yang Ye’s figure.

She walked over to him, stroked his cheek gently, and just gazed at him.

The young boy from before was all grown up now.

Su Qingshi couldn’t help but shake her head when she thought of how rash he’d been in the past. Actually, it was coincidence that had brought them together,

“Qingshi!” A voice came from behind her.

It was Xiao Yuxi, and Zhuang Weiran and Bai Zhixian were by her side.

Su Qingshi nodded slightly and left the cultivation room with them.

In a hall within the Sword Sect.

All of Yang Ye’s wives were here.

Su Qingshi glanced at them and indicated that they should sit, and then she spoke softly, “Do you have any complaints?”

They remained silent.

Su Qingshi spoke softly, “It’s normal to feel unhappy. We’ve been in this pagoda since we got together with him, or to put it in an even more blunt manner, we’re just beautiful flowers that are only good for decoration.”

All of them remained silent.

Su Qingshi fell silent for a moment and said, “If you’re given a chance to not meet him, what would you choose?”

They shook their heads.

Su Qingshi grinned, “I understand how all of you feel, and I understand your feelings for him. Every one of you have a past with him. While it’s in the past, it’s something engraved deep into your hearts and bones. Yuxi, Weiran, Xiyue, Biru, Zi’er, and Zhixian… All of you were experts in the past, and I’m sure you don’t want to continue living your lives like this.”

She stood up and said, “If you want to leave, I’ll permit it on his behalf.”

All of them gazed at Su Qingshi.

Su Qingshi spoke softly, “Love isn’t a shackle. He won’t shackle all of you. If you want to go, you can. However, I hope you’ll return one day. This is your home.”

Xiao Yuxi spoke softly, “I don’t want to cause trouble for him!”

Su Qingshi smiled, “You won’t. We’ve been with him since a very, very long time ago. So, those people out there don’t know about us. Moreover, all of you aren’t weak. Even though most of you used resources to push your cultivations up there, it doesn’t affect your strength much. So, if you want to head out there and traverse your own path, you can do that.”

All of them fell silent.

They had wanted to go outside as they didn’t want to just be pretty faces. However, they willingly stayed in order to avoid causing trouble for him.

Yet now, they could go outside. However, they realized that they felt quite reluctant.

Meanwhile, Su Qingshi continued, “Love isn’t about confinement and possession. He understands me, and he understands all of you.”

A short while later, Zhuang Weiran suddenly left the hall. She arrived in the cultivation room. She bent down and kissed Yang Ye on the forehead before speaking softly, “I miss the days of beating you up with a single hand. Unfortunately, I’ll never be able to do that again. Of course, you will never fight back if I did hit you.”

She kissed him again. It was on the lips this time.

A short while later, she stood up and spoke softly, “I’ll be back.”

As soon as she finished speaking, she turned around and left the Primordial Pagoda.

Not long after she left, Xiao Yuxi and Bai Zhixian arrived in the cultivation room. Xiao Yuxi went over to Yang Ye, touched his face gently and left.

She left the Primordial Pagoda too!

Meanwhile, Bai Zhixian arrived before Yang Ye. She sat on her knees and smiled, “Xiyue said that you’re a pervert, and I think she’s right. She also said your greatest dream is to sleep together with us all. Once I return, I’ll help you persuade the others!”

She gave him a long kiss and left.

The last to come was Zi’er. She glanced at him and left.

She didn’t leave the pagoda, and she returned to the hall.

As far as she was concerned, the best place in the world was by his side.

She’d been the first to stay with Yang Ye, and she would also be the last.

Only Zi’er and Su Qingshi were left in the hall.

Zi’er gazed at Su Qingshi, “You’re not leaving?”

Su Qingshi grinned, “Someone has to take care of this huge place. We can’t just leave it to Snowy, Erya, and Lei Lin, right? They will turn this place upside down!”

Zi’er shook her head and smiled. She glanced at the empty hall and spoke softly, “All of them are gone!”

Su Qingshi spoke softly, “They know that they can’t catch up to him, but they still want to try. Of course, they want some fresh air too. Love isn’t to possess or to confine. They are free. They’ve done too, too much for him over the years, and he owes all of us too, too much!”

Zi’er spoke softly, “No one owes anyone anything in love. I’m just worried about their safety!”

Su Qingshi grinned, “It’s alright. I left my divine sense on all of them. So long as they’re in danger, I’ll notify Senior Cang Mu and Senior Sha Ji to help them. So, they will be fine. Moreover, they’ve been in here for too long. They’ll be back after relaxing out there for some time.”

Zi’er gazed at Su Qingshi for a long time. In the end, she looked down, “He’s lucky to have you!”

Su Qingshi had been organizing and maintaining everything for Yang Ye throughout the years, and everyone acknowledged her status.

Even Erya and Snowy were obedient before her. She was a true leader here.

Su Qingshi looked out the hall and seemed to have thought of something, causing a faint grin to appear on her face.

In the cultivation room, Yang Ye opened his eyes.

Hiss! Hiss!

A strand of mysterious energy was wriggling around him!

Past Life Energy!
