Chapter 1309 – A Sprite Lord of Legend?

After passing through the wasteland and desert, Yang Ye entered a boundless mountainous region.

Yang Ye was surprised to actually not encounter a single demon beast all along the way. Even if he’d entered the mountains, he still hadn’t encountered any.

Zi’er spoke softly, “We should just be at the border.”

Yang Ye nodded. He looked up and saw endless towering mountains at the end of his field of vision. They rose up in succession, and they were even longer and larger than Heaven Pillar Mountain.

Yang Ye fell silent for a short while before he said, “Let’s go.”

As he spoke, he started walking forward while holding Zi’er hand. He’d used the Sword Domain to conceal himself, Zi’er, and Snowy. At the same time, he was constantly vigilant of his surroundings. So long as anything unusual arose in an area of a few thousand kilometers, he would notice it in an instant.

Since even the Nie Clan feared it so much, it was obvious how terrifying the demon race’s strength was. So, Yang Ye naturally didn’t dare to act carelessly.

Zi’er asked softly, “What would you do if the demon race is really extremely strong?”

Yang Ye didn’t hesitate to answer, “Run!”

Zi’er asked another question, “What if the demon race slaughters the human race?”

Yang Ye fell silent. If the human race and demon race really did go to war, then the human race would be unable to avoid being slaughtered if it lost. Similarly, if the demon race lost, then it would be enslaved or slaughtered as well. After all, those not of the same race definitely carry ill intent. Regardless of whether it was the demon race or any other race of beings in the world, all of them had the same mindset.

Yang Ye pondered deeply for a long time before he said, “Zi’er, you have to realize that I don’t have the ability to be a savior of this world. If chaos arrives, all I can do is try my best to protect my own. If I were Jian Wuji, then I wouldn’t have sacrificed myself for Dark Hell Continent. I would have just taken the members of Sword God’s Palace with me and left Dark Hell Continent. In my heart, I always prioritize my own. If I have the ability, I don’t mind being a savior. However, trying to be a savior without sufficient strength doesn’t just bring harm to myself, it’ll bring harm to my loved ones, friends, and subordinates!”

Zi’er tightened her grasp on Yang Ye’s and rested her head gently on his shoulder, “I don’t want you to be a hero. Heroes always suffer miserable ends. Not only will they die a miserable death, it’s the same for their loved ones and friends.”

Yang Ye smiled, “I’m a selfish person.” Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Zi’er replied softly, “I like how selfish you are!”

Yang Ye chuckled, and then he sped up towards the depths of the area.

After passing countless mountains, Yang Ye suddenly stopped, and Zi’er frowned as well. They exchanged glances before slowing down. Once they went past the mountain before them, they were instantly stunned by the scene before their eyes. A group of huge demon beasts was at the foot of the mountain below them. These demon beasts looked like cows yet only had 2 legs, and they were standing up. Their figures were tall and robust, and they towered to a height of almost 10m. Moreover, their bodies were covered in a layer of black scale armor!

Yang Ye glanced at them and noticed that there were a thousand of them. Every single one of them was an Emperor. Moreover, Yang Ye was shocked to notice that the scale armor they wore was actually Quasi Emperor Rank armor!

The physical defenses of demon beasts was heaven defying on its own, so how terrifying would it be if it was supplemented with a Quasi Emperor Rank armor? Of course, it was nothing before Voiders. However, if the human Emperors encountered these demon beasts.... It was obvious that besides a few monstrous geniuses, all other human Emperors wouldn’t just be incapable of fighting these demon beasts, even penetrating these demon beasts’ defenses would be a problem for them!

Meanwhile, a terrifying aura suddenly appeared here. Yang Ye focuses his gaze and saw a demon beast in silver scale armor had appeared before the group. It was in a similar state as the other demon beasts, but its figure was 3 times larger, and the silver scale armor it wore was at the Emperor Rank.

A Voider Realm demon beast!

Roar!

The other demon beasts in black scale armor immediately roared in unison when they saw the demon beast in silver armor. Their roars were like a thunderclap that shook the surrounding mountains.

The demon beast in silver armor raised its right hand, and the surroundings instantly fell silent before it started saying something.

Yang Ye was naturally unable to understand the language of the demon race, so he immediately gazed at the violet mink. A short while passed before the violet mink said, “They are training. Those who qualify stay, and those who fail will be eliminated. The top 10 will be rewarded with treasures like Adamantium Fruits and various other Emperor Rank fruits and herbs.... As for those that are eliminated, their names will be inscribed on a huge stone in their clan so that all demon beasts can gaze at it with disgust.”

Yang Ye broke out in cold sweat when he heard this.

Demon beasts weren’t terrifying. But educated demon beasts were terrifying!

Would the human race stand a chance when the demon beasts were as intelligent as humans? Especially when it was a united demon race.

Meanwhile, Zi’er suddenly said, “This is just a single clan!”

Yang Ye asked, “In other words, there are others?”

She nodded, “They seem to have to participate in a competition with other clans.”

A moment of silence ensued before Yang Ye said, “Let’s go look around.”

As he spoke, Yang Ye vanished on the spot with the violet mink.

After passing a few mountains, the ground suddenly shook. It wasn’t just the ground, even the mountains in the surroundings had started to tremble.

Roar!

Numerous roars resounded from afar, and they sounded like deafening thunderclaps.

The two of them exchanged glances, and then they shot towards the distance. It didn’t take long for a group of demon beasts to appear before them. These demon beasts were slightly similar to Swordtooth Tigers. The only difference was that they were much larger and completely pitch black as if they’d been covered in ink.

There just happened to be a thousand of them. Just like the group of demon beasts from before, they wore thick black scale armor, and all the armor were at the Quasi Emperor Rank!

Zi’er spoke softly, “Human Emperors are no match for them in single combat.”

Yang Ye nodded. These demon beasts could single-handedly fight 2 or even 3 humans at the same realm of cultivation. It couldn’t be helped; the demon race’s physical defenses were too terrifying. Coupled with the fact that they had armor, only few human geniuses, capable of surmounting their realms of cultivation to do battle, stood a chance against them. As for the rest of the human race, it was utterly impossible for them to defeat these demon beasts in single combat.

After a long moment of silence, Yang Ye said, “Let’s go look further!”

Zi’er nodded in response.

They left and continued forward. Yang Ye’s heart felt quite heavy. Because the demon race wasn’t just stronger than he’d imagined, it was even more intelligent than he’d imagined!

After traveling for quite some time, another group of demon beasts appeared before them. This time, it was a group of flaming lions. These lions were huge and even two times the size of the last 2 groups of demon beasts. They had scale armor on them as well. But they weren’t black colored armor, it was fiery red armor instead, and they were at the Quasi Emperor Rank as well.

The aura of these fiery lions was much stronger than the last 2 groups of demon beasts, but there were only 500 of them.

2,500 Emperors!

Yang Ye took a deep breath, led Zi’er around the group of fiery lions, and then continued forward. They only traveled for a short while before a sharp cry resounded abruptly from the sky. Yang Ye and Zi’er looked up, and they saw a group of dark blue rocs had appeared in the sky. They were enormous. Just their wings expanded to a length of 300m, and they were extremely swift. It only took them an instant to vanish above Yang Ye and Zi’er.

Even though they’d vanished, Yang Ye had still seen them clearly. All 500 of them were at the Emperor Realm, and they wore thick Quasi Emperor Rank scale armor as well!

3,000 Emperors!

Even though there were quite a huge number of Emperors, Yang Ye had noticed very few Voiders. These demon beasts only had a single Voider leading them. But it made sense because it was usually impossible for 2 Voiders to appear in a single clan of demon beasts. Unless one was male and the other was female!

Yang Ye stood silently on the spot for a long time, and then he said, “Let’s see exactly how terrifying the demon race is!”

As he spoke, he led Zi’er forward.

Because they were concealed by the Sword Domain, no demon beast had noticed them all along the way. As they went deeper into the mountains, Yang Ye grew more and more shocked. Because the demon beasts were very orderly and disciplined, just like a human army. If the entire army of the demon race was like this, then it would definitely be absolutely terrifying!

The king of the demon race isn’t ordinary!

After all, all demon beasts enjoyed freedom, and they didn’t like being bound. But the king of the demon race had been able to make them become so obedient and disciplined them like a human army. It wasn’t something that could be accomplished with just strength. Just like him. Even though he possessed extraordinary strength, his ability in management of the Sword Alliance was absolutely inferior when compared to Ye Liuyun.

Meanwhile, Zi’er spoke abruptly, “The king of the demon race is extraordinary!”

Yang Ye nodded and replied, “If they really intend to attack the human race, then I have to say that the human race is really in danger.”

Even though he didn’t know anything about the demon race’s overall strength, he was very well aware that its overall strength definitely surpassed the human race. If the human race didn’t have Heaven Pillar Peak as a natural barrier, the human race would have no chance.

Yang Ye seemed to have thought of something and suddenly looked at Zi’er, “I almost forgot that you are part of the demon race as well.”

Zi’er tightened her grip on Yang Ye’s hand and said, “I stand on your side. If the humans try to kill you, I’ll kill humans for you; if demon beasts try to kill you, then I’ll kill demon beasts for you.”

She knew that Yang Ye would definitely stand on her side if the humans wanted to kill her, and he would support her regardless of whether it was right or wrong. It was the same for her!

Yang Ye’s heart felt warm as he gazed at her, and then he grinned, “Let’s continue looking around. I’m getting more and more curious about the demon race.”

Zi’er nodded, and then they continued forward.

After traveling for around 2 hours, Yang Ye’s face had gradually grown solemn. Because he’d sensed numerous formidable and obscure auras. Obviously, they belonged to Voiders.

Right when they were about to continue forward, their expressions suddenly changed drastically. Meanwhile, a voice resounded from behind them, “A demon beast? It’s even an auspicious beast, the Spatial Mink. How could that be possible? Eh? A Sprite King? It’s even a Sprite Lord of legend. How could this be possible? Hmm? There’s a human as well.... This... this is the Sword Domain....”
