Chapter 394 – You’ve Lost!

Yang Ye nodded and said, “Indeed. It’s time for both of us to fight seriously!”

“Oh?” A wisp of excitement flashed through An Nanjing’s eyes as she said, “You have other trump cards? Very good. I really look forward to it!”

The corners of Yang Ye’s mouth twitched. This woman is really a madwoman when it comes to battle!

He was still slightly shocked when he recalled the prior battle they had. If he didn’t possess the Enlightened Sword Heart, then he wouldn’t have been able to hold on for a few breaths of time. Her speed, strength, and all sorts of shocking methods of battle were truly too terrifying!

He felt that she deserved the title of Martial God!

Yang Ye took a deep breath, and then he flicked with his finger. The Nether Ghostflame flashed onto Dragonbone, and then his profound energy surged violently into Dragonbone, causing the flames on Dragonbone to gradually turn maroon. Moreover, countless rays of light and sparks shot incessantly towards the surroundings!

A wisp of a resolute expression flashed through Yang Ye’s eyes, and he stopped concealing his strength. With a command in his heart, the Ninth Hell Cold Gale flashed and formed a pair of wings on his back. In an instant, the entire Hidden Dragon Arena was covered in bone piercing cold wind!

The Ninth Hell Cold Gale!

The countless spectators in the surroundings were astounded upon witnessing this scene. Another Natural Treasure? He actually possesses two Natural Treasures?

Both Qian Huan and Feng Xiu were stunned as well. Obviously, they hadn’t expected that Yang Ye actually possessed two Natural Treasures. Two Natural Treasures! Could it be that this fellow, Yang Ye, has received Karmic Luck in the past?

Qian Huan shook his head with a slight helpless expression on his face. This fellow, Yang Ye, is truly too richly endowed by nature.

On the other hand, a wisp of greedy flashed through Feng Xiu’s eyes....

“The Ninth Hell Cold Gale?” An Nanjing muttered lightly and said, “You really have surprised me slightly as you were actually able to possess to Natural Treasures. Come, let me see how strong they are!”

“As you wish!” Yang Ye slowly raised the sword in his right hand, and he pointed it right at An Nanjing before he moved his left hand to hold his sword as well. After a moment of silence, his hands suddenly transformed into two dragon claws. At the same time, his eyes had turned blood red!

The wings on his back suddenly flapped, and then Yang Ye vanished on the spot. A ray of light flashed before Yang Ye appeared in front of An Nanjing, and then the spectators heard An Nanjing’s voice. “Ward!”

After that, the spectators below the arena were flabbergasted.

An Nanjing pushed her right palm forward, and the tip of Yang Ye’s sword that was covered in maroon flames had struck the center of An Nanjing’s palm.

A wisp of a ruthless expression flashed through Yang Ye’s eyes, and then the wings behind him flapped once more as he shouted. “Break!” T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

As soon as he spoke, he suddenly twisted his sword, and it stabbed straight forward. An Nanjing’s expression changed slightly, and then she suddenly clenched down and held forcefully onto Yang Ye’s sword.

However, right at this moment, Yang Ye twisted his palm, and his sword twisted along with it. An Nanjing’s expression changed once more. She released her grip on Yang Ye’s sword, stomped lightly with her right foot, and moved over 30m back!

An Nanjing opened her palm, and a blood red gash that was a few centimeters long had appeared there. Moreover, fresh blood was flowing incessantly from within it!

As she gazed at the blood red gash at the center of her palm, An Nanjing was stunned before she gazed at Yang Ye and said, “I never expected that the ‘Ward Mantra’ would actually be broken by you, and I never imagined that you would actually be able to injure me. Yang Ye, right? You’ve really given me a huge pleasant surprise. Life won’t be lonely anymore with you here!”

“Not lonely anymore?” Yang Ye chuckled lightly and said, “What? Could it be that you’ve taken a liking to me?”

“Taken a liking to you?” An Nanjing was stunned, and then she nodded slightly and said, “You’re right, I really have. Your strength isn’t bad, so the path cultivation will be even more interesting with you to accompany me!”

The corners of Yang Ye’s mouth twitched. Could it be that she didn’t realize that I was teasing her? Right, she’s obsessed with the Martial Dao and coupled with her extremely formidable strength, there probably isn’t anyone who dares to tease her. So, it’s normal that she’s unable to discern hat I was teasing her!What am I thinking of? It’s a battle right now! It isn’t the time for all of this!

Yang Ye shook his head lightly, and then he retracted the Ninth Hell Swordwings that was on his back. The profound energy within his body had been completely exhausted after he utilized it twice in succession. At this moment, he only had his physical strength and defense left.

An Nanjing seemed to be aware of Yang Ye’s current condition, and she said, “Even though you’ve injured me, you don’t have the strength to continue fighting anymore. So how about we stop the battle between us right now? After all, I still hope that you’ll be able to continue giving me pleasant surprises in the future.”

“Then how about you give the 1st position to me?” said Yang Ye. If she was willing to give him the 1st, then ending the battle now was for the best. After all, his objective was to obtain Karmic Luck to save Xiao Yuxi and repay the An Clan. He hadn’t participated in all of this for that so-called reputation the competition would provide. Could reputation put food on one’s table? The answer was no!

An Nanjing shook her head and said, “Even though I look down upon such a ranking, my clan needs it. So, I can’t give it to you. If you really want it, then use your own strength to fight for it. But it looks to me like you don’t have the ability anymore.”

Yang Ye suddenly said, “How about we make a bet?”

“What bet?” An Nanjing was slightly stunned. If it was any other person, her fist would have greeted that person by now. However, she felt like she couldn’t see through Yang Ye and coupled with Yang Ye’s ability to injure her, she didn’t mind wasting a little time on him.

“You agree to do 3 things for me if I win, and I’ll do the same if you win. What do you think?” asked Yang Ye.

“Are you that confident?” An Nanjing’s brows raised, and she placed her right hand behind her back as she spoke indifferently.

“I want to give it a try!” said Yang Ye. This suggestion wasn’t a spur of the moment. If he really won, it would be equivalent to obtaining the help of an extraordinary expert! As for losing, it was fine as well. With her pride, she would definitely not make him do anything too difficult for him!

An Nanjing nodded slightly and said, “Looks like you still have some sort of trump card. Alright, let’s do it like this. If you’re able to injure me again, then you can take the 1st position on the Hidden Dragon Rankings. Moreover, I’ll agree to do 3 things for you. However, if you’re unable to injure me, then I’ll kill you myself. I hate others wasting my time, even if it’s you. Understand?”

Yang Ye nodded, and then he walked slowly towards An Nanjing. She didn’t move and just gazed indifferently at him, and there was a trace of curiosity in her eyes. She wanted to know exactly how this man who had no profound energy left would injure her.

In next to no time, Yang Ye arrived in front of An Nanjing. When he looked at her from such a close distance for the first time, he had no choice but to admit that she was extremely charming. She had oval eyes, sharp and slanted brows, and a reserved expression. Moreover, her eyes were always calm like water, and it seemed like nothing could move her.

She seemed like such a weak woman, but who would imagine that this woman’s seemingly weak and delicate figure would be hiding such terrifying strength?

Yang Ye shook his head and said, “Stretched out your hand!”

An Nanjing’s beautiful brows knit together slightly, but she still stretched out her right hand. However, she wouldn’t let Yang Ye strike her just like that. There was a strand of indescribable energy on her palm, and this energy came from the ‘Ward Mantra’ from her Triad Mantra technique. So, unless Yang Ye was capable of bringing forth such strength as he had just now, otherwise, his physical strength alone was utterly incapable of breaking through the defenses of the Ward Mantra.

Yang Ye took a deep breath and stopped hesitating. He placed Dragonbone on An Nanjing’s palm. In the next moment, a strand of invisible energy appeared in an area of 1.5m around them. An Nanjing’s eyes instantly opened wide when this energy appeared, and there was shock in her eyes for the very first time!

The countless spectators below the arena were puzzled and bewildered by this scene. What has happened between them? What exactly has happened? Why has such a shocked expression appeared on the face of the Martial God who has always been calm and indifferent until now? What exactly did Yang Ye do?

All of them were puzzled and bewildered!

On the arena, Dragonbone started to tremble violently as if something was about to charge out from within it. Yang Ye tightened his grip on it, and it instantly calmed down before he flicked it lightly. The indescribable energy on An Nanjing’s palm instantly vanished into nothingness, and then a blood red mark that was thin like a thread had appeared on her palm!

Yang Ye put his sword away, and then he gazed at An Nanjing who still had deep shock in her eyes as he said, “An Nanjing, you’ve lost!”

A mighty uproar broke out below the arena....
