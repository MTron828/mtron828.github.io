Chapter 1635 - Get The Fuck Out Here!

Translator: InVader

Was it rash?

It was a little rash.

Yang Ye was very well aware that by killing Yang Danqing in front of this expert from the Yang Clan, he would definitely be offending the expert.

But he didn’t care. Because he knew that the Yang Clan wouldn’t kill him because of someone who was dead.

The dead had no value!

Besides that, he was very well aware that the greater the potential he displayed, the more highly the higher-ups of the Yang Clan would think of him. Just like Yang Lianshuang. He was certain that no matter how much trouble she caused the Yang Clan in the outside world, the Yang Clan would definitely help her deal with it.

Of course, the precondition was that someone had value!

In the beginning, he’d planned to capture Yang Danqing alive, and he was about to succeed. But the arrival of this expert from the Yang Clan allowed him to realize that capturing her alive was impossible. So, he’d chosen to kill her.

Once Yang Ye spoke those words, the aura high above had suddenly dispersed, and then an old man appeared not too far away from Yang Ye.

A Zenith Realm expert!

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly while his profound energy started to circulate. It was because the old man was much stronger than his Blood Puppets.

The old man gazed at Yang Ye, “What did you say? Why don’t you say that one more time?”

Yang Ye nodded, and then he vanished on the spot. He was in front of the old man when his figure appeared once more, and then he drew his sword and swung it.

The old man’s gaze instantly turned icy cold, and then he flipped his right palm and slapped it forward.

Boom!

At the instant he slapped his palm forward, the space in a huge area started to shake violently like an earthquake was surging through it!

Bang!

An explosion resounded as Yang Ye’s figure was blasted over 3km away. However, his figure suddenly transformed into a ray of light that vanished on the spot.

The Sword of Rebirth!

The Sword of Rebirth that was enhanced by two types of Returnal Rank intents!

A ray of light flashed.

Boom!

The light dispersed to reveal the old man had been pushed over 1km away.

The old man looked down at his right hand. At this moment, the center of his palm had a hole in it. He fell silent for a moment before he looked up at Yang Ye, “Two types of Returnal Rank intents. Slaughter intent and sword intent.” He paused for a moment and continued, “Which young master are you?”

Yang Ye replied, “You’ll find out in the future.”

The old man shook his head, “You’ve broken the rules. So, return to the Discipline Hall with me right now.” He stretched his hand forward, and then a powerful wave of suction force sucked Yang Ye over to him.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye vanished abruptly on the spot. The old man’s expression changed at the exact same instant, and then his figure vanished on the spot. He was 3km to the left when he appeared again.

However, his pupils constricted when he’d just appeared there, and then he vanished once more. At the same time, a terrifying aura suddenly swept through the starry sky and caused the space around it to ripple violently.

Three breaths of time later, everything calmed down.

At this moment, Yang Ye and the old man were less than 300m away from each other.

Yang Ye was still standing with his sword in hand.

The old man stared at Yang Ye while undisguised shock and a trace of fear could be seen in his eyes.

If someone was standing behind his back right now, that person would see two extremely deep cuts there. Moreover, his back was covered in blood.

Yang Ye glanced coldly at the old man, “It’s not that I can’t kill you. Understand?”

Yang Ye turned around and walked away once he finished speaking.

Suddenly, the old man said, “You broke the rules. The Discipline Hall won’t let you go. Yang Danqing’s parents won’t let you go too. It’s best for you to return and admit your crimes. Otherwise…”

Yang Ye suddenly stopped and said, “They can feel free to come for me!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye vanished on the spot.

The old man silently gazed at the Yang Ye had been standing on for a long time. Around ten breaths of time later, a white haired old man suddenly appeared by the old man’s side. The white haired old man glanced at him and said, “Yang Lin, you actually lost?”

The old man called Yang Lin shook his head, “I almost died.”

The white haired old man was visibly surprised, “Do you know which young master it was?”

Yang Lin shook his head again, “I don’t. At the very least, he doesn’t exist amongst the known young masters.”

The white haired old man fell silent for a moment and said, “No matter which young master he is, since he dared to offend our Discipline Hall, then we have to make him feel our power. Otherwise, all those other young masters would think that we’re easy to bully.”

Yang Lin hesitated for a moment and said, “We have to be careful. He’s not someone easy to deal with.”

The white haired old man laughed coldly, “Which one of our Yang Clan’s young masters is easy to deal with?”

Yang Lin nodded, and then he glanced at Yang Danqing’s corpse. He said, “Yang Kong will probably not let the matter rest. He’s really protective of that precious daughter of his. Now that Yang Danqing was killed right in front of me, I’m afraid that even I…”

The white haired old man shook his head, “Who can he blame if her skill was inferior to her opponent? Of course, this new young master is really ruthless. He didn’t leave any room for maneuver, and he didn’t even give her the chance to be reincarnated!”

Yang Lin spoke in a low voice, “Now that this fellow has joined in, the competition for the position of successor will be interesting. Unfortunately, Yang Lianshuang isn’t male.”

The white haired old man nodded, “It’s a pity indeed. I heard she has attained the Zenith Realm…”

Yang Lin was stunned speechless.

…

The Yang Clan had over 20 large worlds and countless medium and small worlds. Amongst these worlds, Heaven Void Continent was the largest and most prosperous. Because it was the base world of the Yang Clan, it was the Yang Clan’s headquarters.

Phecda City.

Phecda City was the largest city on Heaven Void Continent, and it was the Yang Clan’s base city. It was huge, huge to the point it seemed boundless. Even though it was huge, the entire city was very quiet. Because the city was only inhabited by some special organizations within the Yang Clan.

Only the Yang Clan’s members and some special organizations of the Yang Clan, the entire city had no other outsiders in it.

It was the center of the Yang Clan’s command!

Phecda City was bound to not be peaceful during this month. Because those young masters of the Yang Clan would be returning.

Immortal Phoenix Pavilion.

Yang Xuan sat at the seat of the host. Her eyes were closed, and she seemed to be in a meditative state.

She was the only one in the hall.

Meanwhile, an armored figure suddenly appeared in the hall.

Yang Xuan didn’t open her eyes, “What is it?”

The armored figure spoke in a low voice, “Yang Danqing is dead. Her killer was a sword cultivator.”

Yang Xuan’s eyes opened abruptly, “Was it him?”

The armored figure replied, “I dare not say for certain. But it’s very likely. Because only the Eighth Young Master is a sword cultivator, and the Eighth Young Master has no reason to kill Yang Danqing.”

“Then it is him!” Yang Xuan’s were slowly clenched together, “I knew he wouldn’t die that easily. Not only did he survive, he seems to have grown even stronger.” She gazed at the armored figure and continued, “Have you located his whereabouts?”

The armored figure shook its head, “No. Right, he killed Yang Danqing in front of an elder from the Disciple Hall. So, we aren’t the only ones looking for him. The Discipline Hall and Yang Danqing’s father, Yang Kong, are looking for him.”

Yang Xuan suddenly stood up, “We must find him before they do or he’ll be in danger.”

The armored figure nodded, “I’ve sent people to search for him. Right, those other young masters are probably searching for him too. Besides that, the Hall of Elders seems to have sent people to investigate him as well.”

Yang Xuan nodded slightly, “They would naturally be curious when one more young master just appeared out of nowhere, and it’s actually one who isn’t ordinary. But they would probably never expect this young master to be the son of the person they abandoned and forgot all those years ago.”

The armored figure asked, “Will the Hall of Elders acknowledge him?”

Yang Xuan laughed coldly, “Of course. So long as he possesses natural talent and potential, they’ll acknowledge him. Not to mention that he belongs to the Yang Clan, and he has the bloodline of the Yang Clan.” She gazed at the armored figure and continued, “Use all the resources available to us. He must be found before they find him. We especially can’t allow Yang Kong to find him first. His current strength is utterly insufficient to resist Yang Kong.”

“Understood!” The armored figure nodded and left.

After the armored figure left, Yang Xuan sat back down and spoke softly, “You killed Yang Danqing before an elder of the Disciple Hall? Your strength has grown to such an extent…”

As she spoke up to this point, she seemed to have thought of something, and it made her face gradually turn gloomy.

…

Yang Ye didn’t head to Heaven Void Continent. He went to Yang Yan’s territory, Yanqing Continent, instead.

He’d come to the Yang Clan with the objective of rescuing Little Sky, and Little Sky’s soul was definitely in Yang Yan’s possession. So, he naturally went to look for Yang Yan.

Unfortunately, he didn’t find Yang Yan.

…

Yanqing City.

Because of the seventh young master of the Yang Clan, Yang Xing, Yanqing City was in pieces. However, Yang Yan clearly had no intention to abandon it. So, he’d sent many people to rebuild the city.

All of them were cultivators and not ordinary people. So, Yanqing City had been almost completely restored in a short while.

Yang Ye who couldn’t find Yang Yan left the city, but he didn’t leave. He just stood in midair around 3km away from the city.

He gazed at the city for a long time, and then he suddenly drew his sword and swung it.

Om!

A sword howl resounded, and then a ray of sword energy shot down like a shooting star.

Boom!

In an instant, Yanqing City was cut into two.

A moment later, a ferocious voice resounded in the sky above the city, “Yang Yan, get the fuck out here!”

As soon as the voice finished resounding, another ray of sword energy descended upon the city.

Boom!

The entire city collapsed in an instant!Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com
