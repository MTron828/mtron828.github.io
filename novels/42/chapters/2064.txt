Chapter 2065 – I Like to Kill!

The man’s gaze gradually turned icy cold when he saw her act so stubbornly.

“It’s yours now!” Suddenly, a voice resounded.

The man turned around, and he saw a green clothed man walking over slowly.

It was Yang Ye, of course!

Yang Ye had an indifferent expression on his face as he walked slowly towards the man.

The man smiled, “You’re the big brother she spoke of? So, this sword is yours?”

Yang Ye nodded, “It is.”

The man smiled, “What about now?”

Yang Ye replied, “It’s yours!”

The man’s smile grew wider and wider. In the end, he released Tian Xiu. As soon as she fell to the ground, she started coughing violently.

Yang Ye walked over to her and took her in his arms. Meanwhile, she suddenly embraced him and cried, “I… I didn’t sell it, I really didn’t…”

Yang Ye rubbed her head gently and smiled, “I know. Why would you ever sell a sword I gave you?”

She gazed at him, “You really believe me, Big Brother?”

Yang Ye smiled, “Of course I do. Moreover, Snowy believes you too.”

Tian Xiu took Yang Ye’s hand and spoke softly, “But… but he took it and I…”

Obviously, she blamed herself.

Yang Ye smiled, “It’s fine. Leave the rest to me. You just sit there and watch, alright?”

Tian Xiu tightened her grip on Yang Ye’s hand, “What are you going to do?”

Yang Ye replied, “I’ve always been the one who bullies others, so how can I allow someone else to bully me? Bullying you is bullying me.”

As he spoke, he took her in his arms and placed her on the stool, and then he gazed at the young man.

The young man shook his head, “In the beginning, I thought you were a sensible person, but now it seems like…”

Suddenly, Yang Ye vanished on the spot, and the young man’s expression changed drastically. His figure shook and shot backwards, but it was too late. A fish had slammed against his stomach!

A mouthful of blood sprayed from him, and his figure curved inward as it flew out the library.

Outside the library, Yang Ye appeared in front of the young man before his figure even descended to the ground, and then Yang Ye stomped on his shoulder.

Bang!

The young man’s right shoulder shattered while his figure was instantly slammed against the ground. At the same time, Yang Ye stomped down on his chest.

Pu!

A mouthful of blood sprayed from him again.

Yang Ye lifted up the young man and looked him in the eyes. Meanwhile, the sword in the young man’s grasp instantly struggled free and flew behind Yang Ye. Tian Xiu immediately leaped off her stool when she saw this, and she went over to the sword and wrapped her arms around it.

Yang Ye looked the young man in the eyes and said, “It was yours just now. Now, let me ask you this. Who does it belong to now?”

The young man stared at Yang Ye without saying a word.

Suddenly, Yang Ye waved his left hand slightly.

Hiss!

An arm flew up into the air while blood sprayed.

Yang Ye asked, “Did you not hear me?”

The man still remained silent, and he just stared viciously at Yang Ye.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly stomped his foot down on both the young man’s knees.

Crack!

His bones were instantly shattered, causing his legs to slump down. After that, Yang Ye casually tossed the young man to kneel before the library’s entrance. The man was just about to move away when two rays of sword energy flashed out of the air and nailed his feet to the ground.

Yang Ye walked over to Tian Xiu and brought her over to the man. He gazed at her and asked, “Does this make you feel better?”

Tian Xiu hesitated for a moment and shook her head.

Yang Ye was quite puzzled, “Huh?”

Tian Xiu looked up at Yang Ye, “I’m just afraid you’ll be angry and make me leave.”

Yang Ye sighed softly, “Tian Xiu, I know your background is mysterious, but it doesn’t make a difference to me. I don’t care about all of that, and I’ve never thought about using you or anything else. Just like how I saved you that day, I merely think of you as my younger sister. Since I’ve acknowledged you, I won’t abandon you. Do you see me abandoning Snowy?”

Yang Ye noticed that Tian Xiu was quite sensitive, and it wasn’t a very good thing. Snowy’s carefree attitude was much better!

“Do you know who I am?” Meanwhile, the young man spoke in a hoarse voice.

Yang Ye glanced at him and said, “Then do you know who I am?”

The young man looked up at Yang Ye with great difficulty. Yang Ye walked over to him and said, “I don’t care who you are, nor do I care who stands behind you. Let me be clear, no one can save you, even if your father is the dean of Martial Emperor Academy. I’ll still kill you before I die.”

Yang Ye squatted down at this point and continued, “It’s fine if you want to be stubborn. I like stubborn people like you. My request is very simple. Kneel down and say you’re sorry to her, 100 times, and then I’ll give you a swift death!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye stood up and walked over to Tian Xiu, and then he rubbed her head gently, “If someone bullies me, then I may not make a fuss about it if I’m in a good mood, but if someone bullies the people by my side, then I’ll kill that person even if I’m in a good mood.”

Tian Xiu gazed at Yang Ye while seeming to only partially understand what he’d just said.

Yang Ye was utterly unaware that everything he said and did didn’t just influence Snowy’s na?ve mind, it influenced this young girl too, and she was someone who could influence the world in the future.

It didn’t take long for some people to gather around the library. They were here to borrow books, but they frequently gazed at the man kneeling on the ground before shooting lances at Yang Ye and Tian Xiu.

Their eyes were filled with curiosity!

More and more arrived. Two hours later, over 30 people were gathered here.

Meanwhile, a young man in white robes suddenly appeared here. He glanced at the man who was kneeling on the ground, and his face fell at the sight of the miserable state the man was in. He turned around and gazed at Yang Ye, “Did you do that?”

Yang Ye nodded, “I did!”

“Who the hell gave you the courage to do that?!” The white robed man roared with fury, “You…”

Suddenly, the sword on the table transformed into a ray of light that vanished on the spot.

A sword howl resounded. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

The white robed young man’s face changed drastically. He stretched out both hands and pulled outwards. A bolt of lightning appeared in front of him.

After that, a sword stabbed against the lightning. The lightning suddenly expanded and enveloped Yang Ye’s sword.

However, Yang Ye suddenly tapped his palm against the stone table.

Bang!

The stone table shook slightly while Yang Ye’s figure had transformed into a ray of light that shot forward. A moment later, a foot kicked the hilt of the sword.

Hiss!

Yang Ye’s sword stabbed through the lightning. At the same time, the young man’s expression changed drastically, and he forcefully moved his body to the side. But he was still a little too late, and it stabbed his chest.

Bang!

The white robed young man was blasted over 300m away. As soon as he descended to the ground, Yang Ye waved his right hand, and the sword in the young man’s chest immediately flew back into Yang Ye’s grasp while blood sprayed from the young man’s chest.

Deathly silence filled the surroundings!

Everyone gazed at Yang Ye. Is he really just a librarian?

They naturally didn’t believe that. So, they grew curious about his identity, and some even started investigating!

Meanwhile, the white robed young man glanced at the hole in his chest, and then he looked up at Yang Ye, “Who are you?!”

Yang Ye glanced indifferently at the white robed man, and then he pointed at the man kneeling on the ground, “I didn’t kill you for a reason. I don’t care who you are, and I don’t care whose support you have. Now, I want you to go back and tell them that I, Yang Ye, want this fellow’s life. I’ll kill anyone who tries to save him.”

The white robed man’s face grew extremely unsightly. He didn’t attack again because the collision they just had allowed him to realize that he was no match for Yang Ye. So, attacking would be no different than giving his life away!

“Instructor Li is here!” Suddenly, someone shouted.

An instant later, a middle aged man appeared not too far away from Yang Ye. He held a scroll in his hand, and he gave off a dense scholarly aura.

A scholar!

That was the first impression everyone had of him.

The middle aged man glanced at the man kneeling on the ground, and then he gazed at Yang Ye, “I didn’t expect a tiny library to actually be hiding a genius. I’m really surprised.”

Yang Ye shrugged and asked, “Are you here to save him?”

The middle aged man replied with a question, “What do you think?”

Yang Ye smiled, “I think you won’t!”

The middle aged man became slightly interested, “Why?”

Yang Ye smiled, “What do you think?”

The middle aged man sized up Yang Ye and said, “Interesting. While I won’t save him, I have to remind you that his backing isn’t quite ordinary. If you kill him…”

Yang Ye shook his head and interrupted the middle aged man, “Sorry for interrupting but I know what you want to say, and I understand. However…”

He suddenly pointed at the man’s kneeling figure, “If his brother comes to save him, I’ll kill his brother; if his father comes to save him, I’ll kill his father; if his grandfather comes to save him, I’ll kill his grandfather; and if his entire family comes to save him, then I’ll kill them all.”

A smile curled up on the corners of Yang Ye’s mouth, “I’ve never had any bad habits in my entire life, and the only one I do have is that I like to kill!”
