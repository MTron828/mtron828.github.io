Chapter 2215 – That Half Step!

The path of immortality!

Why do people cultivate?

It was for immortality!

As soon as they take the first step into the path of cultivation, their lifespan grows incessantly, and all things can live longer. However, the longer one lives, the stronger one’s desire to live grows.

The desire and ambition of man was without limits.

When a person who could live for just ten years was able to live for 20 through cultivation, that person wouldn’t be satisfied with that and would hope for 30 years, and even 300 years. But once he lives for 300 years, he would seek immortality!

It was like the emperors of the mortal world. Unless they died, they would never give up the authority they held, and some even didn’t want to die.

Desire and ambition!

Every living being had that!

As far as these experts who’d cultivated and lived for countless years were concerned, everything else was insignificant before eternal life!

The undying race had returned, and all five of them were heavily injured. So, they couldn’t see any hope to win. Thus, they had chosen to make a compromise!

In reality, it was no compromise, it was surrendering!

If they didn’t surrender, only death would await!

Fight to the death?

If the undying race was intent on killing them all, they would naturally fight to the death. Yet now, the undying race wasn’t choosing to annihilate them. Thus, they had a way to survive, and thus they chose to survive!

Dugu Juetian gazed at the Dao Progenitor.

Just the Dao Progenitor was left!

The latter fell silent for a moment and chuckled, “Everyone seeks eternal life, and there’s nothing wrong with that. But there’s a saying from the Confucianist Path, there are things a man can do, and there are things he can’t. The Dao is nature, if I have to sacrifice the lives of everyone for my own, it’s not a life worth living.”

Blazing flames appeared around the Dao Progenitor.

Ignition!

It wasn’t ignition of the soul but lifespan!

Dugu Juetian’s expression changed slightly. She hadn’t expected the Dao Progenitor to make this choice.

It was something that the Buddhist Progenitor and the others hadn’t expected either!

Meanwhile, the Dao Progenitor looked up at the sky, and it was in the direction of Void Spirit Continent.

He spoke softly, “I’ll buy you some time!”

Boom!

As soon as he said that, a terrifying aura swept out from within him. At this moment, his aura rose steadily, and it only took a short while for the army of undying cavalry to be blasted away.

“You…” The Buddhist Progenitor was astounded, “You actually absorbed your own lifespan to take that last half step. Is it really worth it?”

Was it worth it?

The Dao Progenitor shook his head slightly and looked down. All the experts of the World Alliance looked at him.

Earlier, only despair filled their eyes.

The five progenitors had chosen to make a compromise, and it meant that they would die! After all, how could they possibly fight back against the undying race’s army and those five progenitors?

It was obviously impossible!

Death!

At that instant, they could see no hope for themselves!

The Dao Progenitor gazed at them for a long time and said, “Run, your luck will decide if you survive!” ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Boom!

As soon as he finished speaking, a monstrous wave of pressure swept out from him. At the same time, the Dao Progenitor raised his hands slowly. In an instant, an invisible force dispersed from him, and it was so powerful that the space throughout the area turned ethereal.

It couldn’t endure the power of the aura!

It couldn’t endure it at all!

It was like a torrent that drowned the undying cavalries and Dugu Juetian.

“Kill!” Meanwhile, Dugu Juetian’s voice resounded, and then every single undying cavalry launched their stronger attack. How terrifying were the joint forces of over 600?

However, the Dao Progenitor could be said to have exceeded the Progenitor Realm after igniting his lifespan!

He was at his strongest!

At this moment, flames were blazing around him. He suddenly transformed into a ray of flames that charged at the undying cavalries.

Dugu Juetian’s pupils constricted. All three spears on her back shot up into the air and toward the Dao Progenitor.

However, they hadn’t even gotten close to him before they were blasted away.

An instant later, the Dao Progenitor had entered the group of undying cavalry.

Bang!

Rumbling resounded throughout the area above the Dao Dimension. The space in a huge area collapsed in this instant, and the people throughout the Dao Dimension started fleeing toward the surroundings.

It was their last chance!

Flee!

Everyone fled madly from the Dao Dimension.

As for Dugu Juetian and the other undying cavalry, they were being kept busy by the Dao Progenitor.

At this moment in the air above, the Dao Progenitor was surrounded by all the undying cavalries, and icy spears surged incessantly at his flaming body. However, undying cavalries were also being blasted away incessantly.

If it was any ordinary progenitor, the 600 undying cavalries would be able to slaughter a progenitor with ease if that progenitor didn’t ignite his own lifespan or soul. After all, they were all at the Sage Realm, and they were no ordinary Sages.

Around 15 minutes later, the area fell silent!

The five progenitors were here, Dugu Juetian and the undying cavalry were here, but the Dao Progenitor was gone. However, they hadn’t gotten off easily as well. Around half of the undying cavalry were heavily injured, and so was Dugu Juetian!

However, the Dao Progenitor had paid with his life!

But countless had fled the Dao Dimension, including the members of the Dao Path.

Actually, the Dao Path had been one of the biggest reasons that the Dao Progenitor had done this. The Dao Path was the culmination of his life’s work, it was everything to him. He really couldn’t abandon them. Just like the Confucianist Progenitor had chosen to sacrifice himself for the Confucianist Path.

While the Dao Progenitor, Weapon Progenitor, and Buddhist Progenitor were all progenitors, their characters were completely different, and the way they did things was completely different too!

The Buddhist Progenitor closed his eyes slowly, gazed at the Dao Progenitor’s corpse, pressed his palms together, and praised Buddha.

The Dao Progenitor hadn’t ignited his soul, he’d ignited his lifespan. So, his body was still intact after dying in battle.

Or to be more precise, he hadn’t been killed by the undying cavalries, he’d perished from exhausting all his lifespan!

Otherwise, based on his strength just now, it would be very, very difficult to kill him!

No matter what, the Dao Progenitor was gone!

The five progenitors fell silent. They hadn’t expected the Dao Progenitor to make this choice. After all, besides themselves, everything else was insignificant to existences at their realms of cultivation.

However, the Dao Progenitor had abandoned countless years of cultivation for a few ants!

It wasn’t worth it!

As far as they were concerned, it wasn’t worth it at all!

Not to mention that those people weren’t really close to them, even if they were actual relatives or loved ones, the five progenitors wouldn’t give up their lifetime of cultivation for those people!

But the Dao Progenitor had!

There was blood on the corner of Dugu Juetian’s mouth. While she wore a mask, it was obvious how furious she was right now!

The Dao Progenitor had spoiled their plans!

Dugu Juetian glanced coldly at the Dao Progenitor’s corpse and said, “Hang his corpse in the area above the Dao Dimension. I want the world to know that resisting my undying race doesn’t end well.”

The Buddhist Progenitor and the others didn’t say anything, and she glanced coldly at them, “Do you have any objections?”

The Buddhist Progenitor pressed his palms together and remained silent.

Dugu Juetian withdrew her gaze and glanced at the undying cavalries. At this moment, more than half of them were heavily injured and needed time to recuperate!

Were they really undying?

Of course not!

Otherwise, the void spirit race wouldn’t have been able to stop them all those years ago!

Dugu Juetian glanced coldly at the Dao Progenitor’s corpse and left.

The undying cavalry followed her!

The invincible army of the undying race!

The news of what happened in the Dao Dimension swiftly spread throughout the large universe. At this moment, all the living beings in the large universe started to feel terror!

Terror!

The five progenitors had surrendered, the Dao Progenitor had fallen, so who else could stop the undying race?

If they could surrender, many would be willing to surrender. However, the undying race didn’t want weaklings, so they didn’t even have the right to surrender!

Despair enveloped the entire large universe!

…

Void Spirit Continent!

At this moment, Yang Lianshuang had repaired the city. While it couldn’t compare to its state in the past, it wasn’t that bad. At least it wasn’t in ruins anymore.

Void Spirit Hall.

There were very few people here. Just Yang Lianshuang, Elder Yuan, and Zhong Ye. Besides that, Yang Ye was in the seat of the host.

At this moment, Yang Ye had heard about the incident in the Dao Dimension.

Meanwhile, Elder Yuan spoke softly, “The undying race’s next target will either be us or the god race. Once we’re dealt with, the entire large universe will collapse in an instant. So, we must make preparations.”

Yang Ye spoke softly, “Was the Dao Progenitor’s corpse really treated like that?”

Elder Yuan glanced at Yang Ye, and he was slightly surprised because Yang Ye actually cared about that. He nodded, “The Dao Progenitor heavily injured the undying race’s army on his own. However, so long as they have sufficient death energy, they’ll be able to recover very swiftly. It won’t take long for them to fully recover.”

Yang Ye nodded, stood up, and started walking to the exit.

Elder Yuan asked, “Where are you going?”

Yang Ye stopped and raised his palm. The Primordial Pagoda appeared above his palm. He gazed at it for a long time before he spoke softly, “Regardless of how my relationship with the Dao Path is, it’s fact that I owe the Dao Progenitor. I won’t save the Dao Path, and its fate has nothing to do with me. However, his corpse is being treated like that, so I think that I should do something about it.”

Elder Yuan spoke softly, “Are you repaying his kindness?”

“Sort of!” Yang Ye clenched his fists slowly, “Of course, the most important reason is that I can’t stand the sight of the undying race!”

Yang Ye transformed into a ray of blood red light that shot up into the sky.
