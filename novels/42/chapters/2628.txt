Chapter 2629

At this moment, everyone here looked toward the bridge.

Yang Ye, Tian Xiu, and Qi Bitian were stunned when they saw the sword cultivator on the bridge.

They naturally recognized that fellow!

It was the sword cultivator who was seeking defeat throughout the universe!

As for Yang Ye, he naturally knew the sword cultivator even better. After all, this fellow was from the same world as him and had an agreement with him too.

Meanwhile, the Yin Lord had an extremely unsightly expression on his face.

He naturally recognized this sword cultivator because he’d gone after the sword cultivator that day!

As for the outcome… He would never forget it!

The sword cultivator was a new face to many here.

Or it should be said that besides the truly supreme experts here like Tian Xiu and Qi Bitian, very few knew him. Because he would only go after experts like Tian Xiu and Qi Bitian.

The sword cultivator walked slowly on the bridge with a sword by his waist.

There were no fluctuations of aura coming from him, nor any sword intent or sword energy.

He was like an ordinary person!

Of course, everyone knew that he wasn’t an ordinary person!

Would an ordinary person dare to come here?

The sword cultivator walked over to Yang Ye’s group, and then he glanced at Yang Ye and grinned, “Long time no see.”

Actually, in his opinion, Yang Ye was a junior because they were from the same place. Moreover, Yang Ye had even joined the Sword Sect. Coupled with the fact that he admired Yang Ye’s father, while Yang Ye was a future opponent for him, he treated Yang Ye like a junior of his.

Yang Ye glanced at the sword cultivator and nodded slightly, “I didn’t expect you to come!”

The sword cultivator smiled, “I was almost leaving.”

He gazed at Qi Bitian and said, “Our battle that day left much to desire. Because you weren’t in your strongest form, and it’s an absolute pity I wasn’t able to have a proper battle with you.”

Qi Bitian grinned, “It’s the same for me.”

The sword cultivator nodded and gazed at Tian Xiu, “Patriarch of the void spirit race, you’re much, much stronger than before.”

Tian Xiu glanced at the woman in a black dress and said, “She’s even stronger! She should be perfect for you!”

The sword cultivator looked up at the woman in the sky, “I’m here for her.”

Qi Bitian suddenly asked, “Do you know who she is?”

The Sword Cultivator shook his head, “That isn’t important. What’s important is that she’s strong enough!”

He walked slowly toward the sky.

The woman looked at the Sword Cultivator below with indifference on her face.

Someone strong?

She’d seen all sorts of experts throughout the years!

She’d seen too many outstanding experts throughout her lifetime, and even someone like Qi Bitian wasn’t very rare to her.

However, as the sword cultivator got closer, her expression changed slightly.

She sized up the sword cultivator, and then she frowned slightly.

Meanwhile, the sword cultivator stopped around 30m away from her, and there was a wisp of excitement in his eyes.

Excitement!

After arriving at Eternal Kingdom, he’d only reacted like this upon meeting Qi Bitian. Because he could sense how strong she was. Unfortunately, he felt regretful about it because Qi Bitian hadn’t been able to unseal herself then.

Now, this woman before him was extremely strong!

No one in the world understood his loneliness.

It had been years, many years. He’d rarely fought, and even if he did, he never used his full strength.

His sword was ceaselessly growing stronger. Unfortunately, fewer cultivated in the sword.

Being at the peak was a form of loneliness, and helplessness too.

Suddenly, the woman took a step forward, and then her pitch black sword slashed down!

Hiss!

A ray of pitch black sword energy appeared in the space before her, and it shot toward the sword cultivator. Something worth mentioning was that this sword energy didn’t exist in Three Dimensional Space!

There was only one way for someone in Three Dimensional Space to stop this attack, and it was to destroy Three Dimensional Space. But even doing that may not be able to fully stop this attack!

Because it existed in Four Dimensional Space!

It was like trapping an ant in a jar. Humans could attack the ant from the outside, but the ant didn’t know up from down because it could only see left and right. So, when humans attack an ant from above, ants aren’t able to defend themselves at all.

It was why Qi Bitian and Tian Xiu had been at a disadvantage!

They were at a disadvantage by nature!

Because all the Grand Dao, Laws, and everything of the Three Dimensional Space was useless against her!

She’d surpassed Three Dimensional Space.

The time, space, Grand Dao, and Laws of this world were meaningless to her.

The sword cultivator closed his eyes slowly.

When the black sword energy was just a little over 1m away from him, he suddenly opened his eyes. He gazed at it and a word floated out of his mouth, “Stop!”

As soon as he said that, the black sword energy stopped!

It had stopped!

Everyone was stunned!

What kind of divine technique was that?

The woman’s eyes narrowed slightly, “Sword Dao True Mantra!”

Sword Dao True Mantra?

Everyone was bewildered, including Yang Ye!

Yang Ye gazed at Qi Bitian who was still resting in his arms. She glanced at the sword cultivator and said, “The Sword Dao True Mantra is a realm in the Sword Dao, a supreme realm, and a truth of the Sword Dao. Only absolutely powerful sword cultivators have a chance to comprehend it. Even though it isn’t an invincible realm, it’s equivalent to being invincible against other sword cultivators. Those at a realm of cultivation lower than him wouldn’t even be able to swing their sword. All swords, sword intent, sword energy, and everything else would be useless before him! In my memories, only a single person in history has ever comprehended it.”

Yang Ye hurriedly asked, “Who?”

Qi Bitian grinned and didn’t say anything else.

The pitch black sword energy just vanished before the eyes of everyone here.

Meanwhile, the sword cultivator appeared before the woman, and then his sword descended straight at her.

She didn’t try to dodge and just allowed it to descend!

The sword descended without making a sound!

The woman’s expression changed when it descended.

It was a very strange attack. It carried no sword energy, light, or any destructive fluctuation of energy.

However, it made the woman in black move 300m back! Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

She’d taken the initiative to avoid it!

She hadn’t taken in head-on!

Qi Bitian’s eyes narrowed slightly, “The extremes of the Emotionless Sword Dao… That attack had no emotions, it was truly at the limits of emotionlessness. No wonder she didn’t dare to go head-on against it. If she did, then even she would probably…”

Qi Bitian seemed to have thought of something, and she shook her head and fell silent.

The peerlessly beautiful woman glanced coldly at the sword cultivator, and the pitch black sword in her grasp started to tremble.

The sword cultivator walked slowly in her direction.

“The extremes of the Sword Dao!” Qi Bitian suddenly spoke softly, “Anything brought to an extreme is extremely terrifying. He had abandoned everything just for his sword, and his sword is at his own limits.”

Yang Ye asked, “Is he invincible?”

Qi Bitian shook her head, “He’s just as his own limits, not the limits of his own Sword Dao. If he wants to go further, the fastest way is to be defeated. In that way, he can discern his own flaws.”

Meanwhile, the sword cultivator suddenly stopped in midair because countless pitch black dots had appeared before him!

Qi Bitian’s expression changed from the sight of this, “She’s trying to teleport you away!”

The sword cultivator suddenly looked up and swung his sword.

Hiss!

This attack obliterated everything before it!

With the sword cultivator at its center, the space in the surroundings started to crack open inch by inch, and the body of the woman before the sword cultivator instantly turned ethereal. However, it didn’t take long for her body to become solid once more. But just a moment later, her figure turned ethereal again… It kept cycling endlessly between these two states.

However, the space around the sword cultivator had been completely obliterated. At the same time, his body turned ethereal, and then he vanished on the spot.

As for the Origin World itself, it started to explode apart inch by inch. Everything had started to crumble!

The attack he’d executed before being teleported away had been too terrifying!

It was so terrifying that the Origin World couldn’t endure it at all!

Besides that, the mysterious barrier the woman in black had placed around the Origin World vanished at this moment!

Countless experts started fleeing upon noticing this.

Flee!

At this moment, all of these peak experts started fleeing in a very embarrassing manner!

Fleeing this world!

They really didn’t want to stay a moment longer!

All of the existences here were too abnormal and terrifying!

Meanwhile, the woman in black was still cycling between an ethereal and solid state.

Qi Bitian suddenly gazed at Yang Ye, “Take them and leave this place.”

She didn’t give Yang Ye time to refuse and just gazed at Tian Xiu, “This clone of hers is at its weakest, and it’s the best opportunity to kill her.”

Tian Xiu glanced coldly at the woman in black and said, “Let’s go!”

Tian Xiu shot up into the air toward the woman in black.

Yang Ye wanted to say something, but a wave of powerful energy suddenly pressed down on his shoulder, and then it tossed him away!

In an instant, Yang Ye, An Nanjing, and the others had been sent away by Qi Bitian.

After that, Qi Bitian looked up at the sky, and then she tapped her right foot down and shot up into the air!
