Chapter 2810 – Just Her Beginning!

The Vicious Tiger roared incessantly, but it received no reply.

Shu Wubian suddenly asked, “What the heck is wrong with it?”

The mysterious expert replied indifferently, “His race was practically annihilated all those years ago.”

Shu Wubian nodded slightly and didn’t say anything else.

The mysterious expert pressed his right palm down. The Vicious Tiger seemed to have sensed something, and it pounced on him!

The mysterious expert frowned slightly and gently pressed his palm forward.

A pitch black door suddenly appeared before the tiger.

Bang!

The others hadn’t even been able to see it clearly before the tiger was blasted away, and the door vanished.

The tiger glanced fearfully at the mysterious expert and didn’t dare to attack again.

The mysterious expert spoke indifferently, “If she shows herself, it probably wouldn’t even take a single attack to kill you!”

The tiger’s face was ferocious, “I fought her all those years ago, she…”

The mysterious expert interrupted the tiger, “Do you think she’s still the same person?”

The tiger stared at him, “What are you trying to say?!”

The mysterious expert chuckled, “Wouldn’t she cultivate throughout these countless years? Wouldn’t she improve?”

The tiger’s face turned quite unsightly.

She’d been overbearing all those years ago and was practically invincible. If she were to grow even stronger, how strong would she be?

The tiger glanced coldly at the mysterious expert, “If she has grown stronger, then how will we even fight her? We can just wait for her to kill us!”

It was an evil beast and had its own pride and honor. However, anyone who’d never faced her would never understand how terrifying she was. All those years ago, she’d slaughtered its entire race on her own. Her strength had been despair inducing even then, yet now, countless years had passed, and that woman…

If there was a god in this world, she would definitely be it!

The mysterious expert shook his head, “You, the Undying Phoenix, the Devil Dragon, the Demonic Qilin, the Black Tortoise, the Ten-Tailed Fox, and me. We have the strength to fight her.”

The Vicious Tiger spoke solemnly, “What are you planning?!”

The mysterious expert replied with a question, “Don’t you want to kill her if you can?”

The tiger replied ferociously, “Of course I do!”

The mysterious expert nodded, “That’s all you need to know. All of you combined with me should be able to fight her.”

The tiger spoke solemnly, “When will we fight her?”

The mysterious expert shot a glance to the side, “Recover to your prime first, and then we’ll wait for the Demonic Qilin!”

The Demonic Qilin!

A wisp of fear flashed through the tiger’s eyes.

It was an existence only inferior to the Evil Progenitor!

…

Meanwhile, two women were flying through space.

It was Tian Xiu and Qi Bitian!

They had been traveling for a very, very long time through the boundless reaches of space.

Tian Xiu asked, “Are we there yet?”

Qi Bitian nodded, “Almost there.”

Tian Xiu asked, “What are we looking for?”

Qi Bitian replied softly, “A casket!”

Tian Xiu frowned slightly and gazed at Qi Bitian with bewilderment.

Qi Bitian grinned, “I’ll explain once we get there.”

They sped up.

Around an hour later, they entered an abandoned planet. Once they descended to the ground, all they saw was a scene of desolation. There wasn’t a trace of spirit energy here!

Qi Bitian spoke softly, “Heavenfall!”

Tian Xiu gazed at Qi Bitian, and the latter explained softly, “A very, very long time ago, this place was the center of the Three Dimensional Universe, and where the Heaven Dao resided. However, along with that woman’s arrival, the Heaven Dao was killed. So, it’s called Heavenfall, and everything here was destroyed as well.”

Tian Xiu spoke solemnly, “How was the Heaven Dao?”

Qi Bitian smiled, “In which aspect? Strength? Or?”

Tian Xiu replied, “How it did things.”

Qi Bitian shook her head, “It wasn’t any different to how Destiny is doing things right now. It felt everyone in the Three Dimensional Universe belonged to it, and once any of the living beings or races posed even the slightest threat to it, it would annihilate them!”

Tian Xiu fell silent.

Qi Bitian spoke softly, “Actually, it’s the same no matter who takes control of the universe. Everyone has selfish intentions, and when that exists, it will grow wild. Moreover, as people live longer, they grow indifferent toward life itself. As far as they are concerned, the fate of all things is insignificant like a speck of dirt!”

Tian Xiu looked up at the sky, “It’s best if both the Heaven Dao and Destiny cease to exist!”

Qi Bitian roared with laughter, “Unfortunately, both the Heaven Dao of the past and the current Destiny are strong like gods.”

She walked forward swiftly while she spoke.Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Tian Xiu fell silent for a short while, and then she followed Qi Bitian.

Qi Bitian led her to a boundless ocean, and a stone casket was floating at the center of the ocean.

Tian Xiu asked, “The Heaven Dao’s coffin?”

Qi Bitian shook her head, “Mine!”

Tian Xiu gazed at Qi Bitian, and the latter spoke softly, “My main body!”

Tian Xiu frowned slightly, “You’re not human?”

Qi Bitian smiled, “I am, but only half. Tian Xiu, help me break open the seal on it.”

Tian Xiu nodded and didn’t inquire further.

Qi Bitian shot over to the casket. Suddenly, it shook violently, and then a few strands of sword energy shot out of it. The sword energy was extremely formidable to the point even Qi Bitian didn’t dare to be careless against it!

Because they were sword energy that Destiny had left behind during her prime all those years ago!

Qi Bitian waved her hand at the sword energy from afar, and a huge palm swept at them. The palm slammed against the sword energy, but it was instantly sliced into countless pieces.

Meanwhile, Tian Xiu arrived, and then a wave of dark light surged at the sword energy.

Bang! Bang!

Pillars of water surged up into the air from the ocean.

A short while later, they’d jointly destroyed the sword energy.

Qi Bitian walked over to the stone casket, tapped it, and its cover flew up into the air. Qi Bitian spoke softly as she looked into the casket, “Tian Xiu, protect me!”

Tian Xiu noded.

Qi Bitian jumped into the stone casket, and it shook violently while even the water beneath it started to surge and roil.

…

After he left the spatial rift, Yang Ye didn’t return to Eternal Kingdom. He went off in search of the woman in black, but he was disappointed.

The woman in black and the woman in white had vanished without a trace!

They hadn’t shown themselves when the entire Four Dimensional Universe had attacked Eternal Kingdom. He’d felt something was off then because they had always been stopping the Four Dimensional Universe from entering the Three Dimensional Universe.

But they were gone at that critical moment!

It was very strange.

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings. He didn’t want to give up just like that, and he sent out his divine sense. His divine sense swiftly swept through the starry sky, and it didn’t take long for his divine sense to almost arrive at its limits!

Yang Ye was quite disappointed. He was about to retract it when he suddenly looked off into the distance. A moment later, the space over there cracked open, and a woman walked out from there.

It was the woman in black!

Her face was icy cold and emotionless as always!

She walked over to him, “What are you doing here?”

Cold and direct!

Yang Ye laughed bitterly, “I missed all of you, alright?”

She glanced coldly at him, “I think you want to die!”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

The woman in black looked toward the Three Dimensional Universe, “She’s about to take action.”

Yang Ye asked, “Your strongest form?”

She nodded.

Yang Ye spoke solemnly, “I’ve always been puzzled about why she doesn’t do it herself. If she did it herself, both the Four Dimensional Universe and Three Dimensional Universe wouldn’t be able to stop her!”

The woman in black looked Yang Ye in the eyes, “After our whole form split into the four of us, we promised to protect the Three Dimensional Universe. She promised our whole form as well. In the beginning, she did as she’d promised, and the Four Dimensional Universe never stepped foot into the Three Dimensional Universe! However, as time passed, she grew stronger, so strong that she far surpassed our whole form.”

The woman in black fell silent for a short while before she continued, “Now, she can annihilate the Three Dimensional Universe whenever she wants!”

Yang Ye was stunned speechless.

The woman in black suddenly asked, “Are you afraid?”

Yang Ye nodded, “Slightly.”

He would be lying if he said that he didn’t lack confidence. Her strength was absolutely heaven defying! Of course, it didn’t represent that he would shrink back in fear. He knew that he would have to fight Destiny, sooner or later!

It was a battle that was impossible to avoid!

The woman in black glanced at Yang Ye, “She won’t destroy the Three Dimensional Universe on her own, but she will crush you and the Destiny Realm experts in the Three Dimensional Universe. She will make the Three Dimensional Universe descend into destruction on its own. That’s her plan!”

Yang Ye frowned slightly and felt quite puzzled, “Why?”

The woman in black replied indifferently, “My past form possessed the Dao of Life, and it was her Dao too. She saved the world and comprehended it, but if she destroys the Three Dimensional Universe herself, it would be destroying her own Dao and denying her own Dao. The Dao of Life she once comprehended would be destroyed if that happens. However, if someone else destroys the Three Dimensional Universe, it would be completely different. She will be able to watch the Three Dimensional Universe’s destruction from a transcendental perspective and use it to comprehend the true Fate Dao. Of course, she probably isn’t destroying it due to her feelings for a certain person from all those years ago… There’s no need to tell you more about that, and don’t ask.”

She paused for a moment at this point and continued, “She used countless years to comprehend the Dao of Life and all the other Daos of the world. However, fate consists of both life and death. Once she comprehends the Dao of Death, her Fate Dao would truly reach perfection. At that time… she would truly be a god. No, even a god wouldn’t be her equal.”

Yang Ye shook his head, “She wants the living beings of the entire universe to help her attain it?”

The woman in black clenched her fists slowly, “Her wild ambition doesn’t stop there.”

Yang Ye gazed at her and frowned, “What do you mean?”

She looked him in the eyes, “Her ambition is huge, very huge. Annihilating all living beings and attaining the Dao may only be the beginning for her!”

The corners of Yang Ye’s mouth twitched, “Don’t scare me like that…”
