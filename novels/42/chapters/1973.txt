Chapter 1974 – I Have A Technique!

Sky Residence City!

A’Man led the group on the city walls.

At this moment, all of them had quite unsightly expressions on their faces.

On the ground below, Dire Wolf and Black Devil led the group, and the experts from Devil Cave and the Dire Wolves were behind them.

They’d joined forces!

A’Man hadn’t expected them to suddenly join forces!

It was a disaster for Sky Residence City.

“A’Man!” Meanwhile, Dire Wolf spoke abruptly, “I’ll give you one last chance. Submit and you’ll have a chance to live, otherwise this day next year will be the anniversary of your death.”

“Submit?” A’Man looked down at Black Devil, “Black Devil, I never expected you to be willing to submit to someone else. What a surprise!”

Black Devil’s expression didn’t change at all, and he spoke indifferently, “A’Man, the wise submit to fate. Don’t be rash and bring disaster to the brothers who stand behind you.”

A’Man glanced at the others, “Do all of you want to submit?”

Qin Chuan chuckled, “We’ll do as you say. Of course, I won’t agree if you want to surrender. I can’t afford the humiliation I’d suffer if word of it spreads to the outside world!”

The others behind A’Man made their opinions clear as well.

They refused!

The followers were usually just like their leader!

A’Man turned to look at Dire Wolf, “See that? My brothers refuse to submit!”

Dire Wolf’s gaze gradually became icy cold, “Since that’s the case, all of you can just die!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he waved his right hand. In an instant, the others behind him transformed into rays of black light that shot towards the city.

A’Man ordered, “Activate the formation!”

Rumble!

Four pillars of light suddenly shot up into the sky, and they converged together in midair. It didn’t take long for a huge barrier of light to cover the entire city. At the same time, numerous rays of light shot out of the city from the barrier of light.

Countless rays of light descended like a storm!

Sky Residence City hadn’t had a formation before this, but after they moved into the city, they jointly set up a formation as a precaution. They were the extraordinary geniuses of the various races, so a formation they jointly set up was definitely not weak.

Dire Wolf and Black Devil’s expressions didn’t change at all.

A’Man couldn’t help but frown at the sight of this.

Suddenly, something unexpected occurred.

Rumble!

Four explosions suddenly resounded from Sky Residence City, and then the entire city started to tremble violently. Qin Chuan and the others watched with shock as the barrier of light vanished abruptly!

The formation was gone!

What’s going on?

All of them were wondering the exact same thing.

Meanwhile, A’Man slowly closed her eyes. At the same time, four figures leaped out of the city and arrived by Dire Wolf’s side.

“Yan Lan, Li Li, Ku Ye, Qing Yu!” Qin Chuan stared at them, “Why did you betray us?!”

All of them had quite unsightly expressions on their faces. Meanwhile, Dire Wolf stepped forward, “They’re wise and submitted to fate, of course!”

Dire Wolf gazed at A’Man and continued, “Now, you have nothing left to rely on.”

A’Man slowly opened her eyes and gazed at the four of them, “While I know that whatever I say now is meaningless, I still want to ask for a reason!”

They remained silent for a short while. In the end, Yan Lan stepped forward, “Big Sis, we want to live, leave this place, and become stronger!”

A’Man wanted to say something, but Dire Wolf suddenly chuckled, “A’Man, let me tell you the truth. Actually, it was just 20 immortal crystals each. I gave them 20 immortal crystals each, and they took my side.”

He roared with laughter, “A’Man, at most times, loyalty is nothing before benefits. So long as the benefit is sufficient, then not to mention friends and brothers, they would even be willing to kill their own fathers.”

He waved his right hand once he finished speaking.

Suddenly, 10 black robed figures appeared around Yan Lan’s group.

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!

A moment later, rays of cold light flickered.

Yan Lan and the others’ expressions changed drastically. None of them had expected Dire Wolf to do this. While they were surrounded by 10 people, their reaction wasn’t slow at all, and they counterattacked simultaneously.

Rumble!

Explosions resounded incessantly. It didn’t take long for two shrill cries to resound, and then two figures flashed out from there.

Two of them had been killed in an instant!

Yan Lan and Li Li had survived, but they were heavily injured and surrounded by 10 others.

Yan Lan stared at Dire Wolf, “Why?”

“Why?” Dire Wolf shook his head, “I look down on those who betray their brothers for some benefits. Since you were able to betray Sky Residence City today, you may stab me in the back one day too. So, it’s best for such people to be dead.”

He waved his right hand, “Kill them!”

Those 10 experts were about to attack when a spiked club suddenly tore through the air and slammed down at them. The powerful might it carried forced them to stop and step back.

An instant later, A’Man led Mad Saber and the others over to Yan Lan and Li Li!

Dire Wolf and the others were quite stunned by this scene.

Obviously, they hadn’t expected A’Man to help them. Even Yan Lan and Li Li hadn’t expected it!

Yan Lan gazed at A’Man and asked, “Why?” Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

At the same time, A’Man turned to look at Yan Lan and Li Li, “We were once brothers. While both of you betrayed us, I can’t be disloyal. But we won’t be brothers anymore after today.”

As soon as she finished speaking, A’Man gazed at Dire Wolf and the others, “Dire Wolf, Black Devil, my brothers and I won’t submit. If you want to fight, then let’s fight.”

“Let’s fight!” Qin Chuan and the others howled with fury.

Morale!

Even though they had fewer experts than the Dire Wolves and Devil Cave, their morale wasn’t any weaker.

They were ready to fight to the death!

At this moment, everyone from Sky Residence City felt the same way!

Dire Wolf stared at A’Man for a long time, and then he waved his right hand, “Kill them!”

A’Man turned to look at Qin Chuan and the others, “Getting to know all of you was my greatest gain in my trip to the Dead Dimension. Let’s be brothers again in our next lives!”

As soon as she finished speaking, she swung her spiked club!

“Kill them!” Qin Chuan and the others howled with fury.

Dire Wolf spoke indifferently, “Kill them all!”

The battle erupted!

Suddenly, a sword howl resounded from the sky.

Dire Wolf looked up at the sky, and then a sword suddenly appeared before him.

Dire Wolf’s eyes narrowed slightly, and he tapped his finger against the tip of it.

Bang!

Dire Wolf was blasted over 300m away, and his finger was broken!

At this moment, everyone was stunned!

It didn’t take long for a man in green clothes to appear before A’Man and the others.

It was Yang Ye!

Yang Ye glanced at A’Man and the others, and then he chuckled, “How can you leave me out of something like this?”

A’Man sized up Yang Ye and replied, “You’re just in time!”

Yang Ye glanced at Dire Wolf’s group, and then he said, “Let me start the battle, alright?”

A’Man replied, “Are you sure?”

Yang Ye nodded, and then he started walking slowly in Dire Wolf’s direction.

Bang!

In an instant, the space around Yang Ye shook violently.

Aura!

An invisible aura slammed down at Dire Wolf and the others!

Their expressions changed when they sensed it, and just when they were about to jointly resist it, Yang Ye suddenly raised his palm and a sword appeared on it. In an instant, the sword started to spin rapidly.

Danger!

As soon as he saw the spinning sword, Dire Wolf’s expression changed, and he instinctively took a step back.

Suddenly, a strange smile curled up on the corners of Yang Ye’s mouth, and then he vanished along with the sword.

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!

The sound of space being sliced apart resounded. At this moment, Dire Wolf was horrified, and his figure shot backwards incessantly. Meanwhile, rays of black light ceaselessly appeared before him.

Three breaths of time later, everything calmed down again!

The surroundings were perfectly silent!

Dire Wolf was still there, but his forehead was covered in cold sweat. An instant later, he suddenly gazed at Black Devil.

Everyone gazed at Black Devil too.

“What…” Black Devil had a blank expression on his face as he gazed at Yang Ye, “That… that was so… so fast…”

Crack!

Everyone watched with shock in their eyes as Black Devil’s body suddenly transformed into pieces, and every single piece was around the size of a fingernail.

An instant!

A Know Dao Realm expert had been killed in an instant!

Everyone gazed at Yang Ye. Especially Qin Chuan and the others, their eyes were filled with astonishment.

When did he become so strong?

Dire Wolf and the others were looking at Yang Ye too, and their eyes were filled with fear.

A sword cultivator!

A formidable sword cultivator!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye’s figure suddenly moved.

Everyone watched as he started walking in Dire Wolf’s direction, and a spinning sword floated by his side!

As the sword spun, rays of light flickered incessantly.

They were ghastly and sharp!

Suddenly, Yang Ye stopped and gazed at Dire Wolf who was just 30m away from him, “I have a technique, do you dare to face it?”

As soon as he finished speaking, a sword howl resounded!
