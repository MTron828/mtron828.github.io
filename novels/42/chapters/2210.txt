Chapter 2211 – Kneel!

Yang Ye frowned, and he was quite bewildered, “Me?”

She glanced at him and said, “Some time ago, an armless man entered the Star Gate.”

An armless man!

Yang Ye’s fists were gradually clenched, “What did he do there?”

Dugu Juetian replied indifferently, “He went to look for something!”

Yang Ye asked, “What?”

“The Sprite of Slaughter!” Dugu Juetian continued, “My undying race conquered billions of universes, so just imagine how many we’ve killed! One of these continents formed a Sprite once its inhabitants were annihilated, the Sprite of Slaughter. If you possess it, then your slaughter intent would multiply! Most importantly, it has endless room for growth. The more you kill, the stronger it becomes. It just happens to be perfect for someone like you. So, he went in there with the intent of getting that Sprite for you. I sense the same bloodline in you.”

Dugu Juetian glanced at Yang Ye, “Do you know what happened in the end?”

Yang Ye shook his head.

Dugu Juetian laughed with ridicule, “He overestimated his strength a little.”

Yang Ye looked up at her.

She spoke indifferently, “However, he was quite outstanding. He was able to return alive. Unfortunately, he was still heavily injured.

Heavily injured!

Yang Ye clenched his fists. At this moment, he finally knew where his father’s injuries had come from.

The undying race!

He’d gone through the Star Gate before being attacked by the five progenitors!

A long time passed before Yang Ye restrained his thoughts, “Why have you come to me?”

“Are you interested in meeting the Sprite of Slaughter?” Dugu Juetian continued, “It’s just behind the Star Gate. Do you dare?”

Yang Ye asked, “Why should I go?”

She replied indifferently, “Do you think that you have a choice?”

Yang Ye frowned.

Meanwhile, Dugu Juetian suddenly said, “Two hours. If you don’t get there in two hours, then 100 undying cavalries will go to Void Spirit Continent, and nothing will be left in their wake!”

She turned around and left once she finished speaking.

Only Yang Ye remained here.

“Go!” Suddenly, a voice resounded.

Yang Ye turned around and saw a middle aged man walking slowly in his direction.

The Martial Emperor!

It was the Martial Emperor whom he hadn’t met for some time!

The Martial Emperor glanced at Yang Ye, “Your father left you something there.”

Yang Ye asked, “What?”

The Martial Emperor replied, “You’ll know once you get there.”

Yang Ye fell silent. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

The Martial Emperor glanced at the surroundings and said, “Regardless of whether it’s the other races, the two Paths, the god race, or the undying race, all of them will be something you must overcome. So, use this opportunity to gain an understanding of them.”

Yang Ye gazed at the Martial Emperor, “What else did he tell you?”

The Martial Emperor shook his head, “He was a straightforward person. You two have something in common, and it’s that once you regard something as correct, you’ll do it without any hesitation. You completely ignore the thoughts and opinions of others.”

He suddenly gazed at Yang Ye and continued, “I presume you resent me, right?”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Resent him?”

The Martial Emperor smiled, “He would have survived if I lent him a hand.”

Yang Ye replied, “But why should you? You don’t owe me or my father. So, you don’t have to offend and even fight them to the death for us!”

The Martial Emperor gazed at Yang Ye and remained silent.

Yang Ye continued, “My father and brothers are dead. However, it’s a path we chose, and it has nothing to do with anyone else. Moreover, I won’t hate someone just because that person didn’t lend me a hand.”

Yang Ye turned around and walked away.

Regardless of whether it was the Dao Progenitor or Martial Emperor, if they helped him, it was out of kindness. However, if they refused to help him, he couldn’t blame them either. As far as he was concerned, his own strength was the only thing he could rely on!

As for relying on others?

That wasn’t realistic at all!

No matter what it was, he had to rely on himself!

Yang Ye left.

The Martial Emperor gazed at his vanishing figure for a long time before leaving.

Yang Ye arrived at the endless black holes. After traveling for hours, he arrived before the door of light, and Dugu Juetian was waiting there for him.

She glanced at him and said, “Let’s go!”

She walked into the door of light.

Yang Ye didn’t hesitate to follow her.

As soon as he entered, he felt dizzy, and white light mixed with lightning were flickering incessantly around him. A long time passed before he felt the surroundings calm down once more.

Yang Ye opened his eyes.

There were no eyes in his eye sockets, only blood red.

While he had no eyes, it didn’t stop him from seeing the world.

Darkness!

The world before him was extremely dark, like the veil of night after dusk. The sky was covered in dark clouds, and Yang Ye sensed an endless aura of death in the surroundings!

To be more precise, it was death energy!

Very, very dense death energy!

Yang Ye asked, “This is the undying race?”

She replied indifferently, “What? You didn’t expect this?”

Yang Ye nodded. Besides dense death energy, there was another thing that stood out about this place, there was no spirit energy.

It had dried up!

The spirit energy here had dried up!

If it was the End Times, then this world would be one that was truly suffering from it.

Meanwhile, Dugu Juetian suddenly waved her right hand. In an instant, a furious howl resounded from afar, and then a huge bird dived down from the sky.

It was quite a strangely shaped bird. It was like a roc, yet it had the head of a dragon and an extremely long tail. Moreover, its tail was extremely sharp like a spike.

A Dragon Hawk!

An ancient being that was ferocious in nature. Its speed was almost as fast as light, and it had been subdued by the undying race.

The Dragon Hawk descended before Dugu Juetian. She got on it and gazed at Yang Ye. Yang Ye’s figure shook and descended on the Dragon Hawk. Suddenly, the Dragon Hawk howled with fury and seemed to be displeased that Yang Ye was standing on it.

Suddenly, Yang Ye stomped his foot down on the Dragon Hawk’s head. An instant later, his sword stabbed into its head. His sword entered halfway into its head while a strand of extremely powerful slaughter intent enveloped the Dragon Hawk.

The Dragon Hawk instantly fell quiet.

Yang Ye put his sword away and gazed at Dugu Juetian, “It has a bad temper, and it needs to be fixed. What do you think?”

She glanced at him and said, “I think you have a bad temper too and need to be fixed!”

Yang Ye shrugged, “Then how about we spar?”

“There’ll be a chance for that!” Dugu Juetian turned around and looked into the distance. At this moment, the Dragon Hawk had brought them far into the clouds. It was extremely swift, and it was so swift that space was torn open in its wake.

Just like that, it flew for around two more hours before it stopped.

At this moment, a huge black city stood before Yang Ye and Dugu Juetian. It was huge, the largest Yang Ye had ever seen in his life. Just its walls were colossal!

Just a block of the wall was multiple times larger than Yang Ye!

There was a towering stone pillar within the city, and it towered into the clouds. A statue stood at the top of it.

Dugu Juetian suddenly became respectful , and then she bowed slightly to the statue before tapping her right foot down. After that, the Dragon Hawk brought her and Yang Ye to the city’s entrance, and it glanced at Yang Ye when it left.

But when Yang Ye gazed at it, it immediately transformed into a ray of dark light that vanished into the sky.

Yang Ye followed Dugu Juetian into the city. The city was empty, and very quiet too. The buildings weren’t very different to the buildings of humans, but they each had their own unique traits. As he walked through the city, Yang Ye noticed something different. Some of the cities had many people lying within them.

It didn’t take long for Dugu Juetian to stop abruptly. There was a square before them, and it was covered in caskets!

There were tens of thousands of them!

Dugu Juetian gazed at them for a very, very long time, and then she continued forward.

Yang Ye followed her.

At the end of the square was a hall. She brought Yang Ye to it and said, “Go inside!”

Yang Ye spoke solemnly, “What are those caskets out there?”

“It’s none of your business!” She replied indifferently, “Go inside. That person wants to see you!”

Yang Ye suddenly asked, “Do you think I’ll be able to come out alive?”

She glanced at him, “You know the situation well. As for whether you can come out alive, if I’m to be honest, you can’t come out alive even if you attain the Progenitor Realm.”

As soon as she finished speaking, she waved her right hand and the door swung open. After that, she pushed Yang Ye into the hall.

Yang Ye’s expression changed when he entered it!

Slaughter intent!

The hall was filled with boundless slaughter intent, and it was so dense that even he wasn’t really able to endure it.

“A perfect host!” Suddenly, a voice resounded in the hall.

Yang Ye looked up, and he saw a blood red ball floating over to him.

Yang Ye said, “You’re the Sprite of Slaughter?”

“I am!” The Sprite of Slaughter grew closer and closer to him, “I’ve been to countless universes, but I’ve never met anyone who attained the Progenitor Realm in slaughter intent like you have. Moreover, you have the Heart of Slaughter. If I devour you, it would take just a few years for people like progenitors to be like ants before me!”

Yang Ye slowly clenched his fist. Meanwhile, the Sprite of Slaughter suddenly continued, “You’re thinking of resisting? Don’t waste your energy. Your strength is extraordinary, and you possess precious treasures, but you’re still too, too weak to me. It’s just your body that’s suitable for me. Otherwise, I wouldn’t even bother to take a glance at an ant like you!”

As soon as it finished speaking, it transformed into a ray of blood red that shot toward Yang Ye.

Yang Ye frowned slightly. He was about to counterattack when a hand suddenly obstructed the ball of blood, and then a voice resounded, “Fucking kneel!”

As soon as the voice resounded, the hand suppressed the ball of blood on the ground.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye’s figure stiffened on the spot.
