Around two hours after they left, Yang Ye suddenly opened his eyes.

Bang!

At the instant his eyes were opened, a terrifying aura surged out from within him, and the space around him instantly started rippling.

It didn’t take long for the aura to surge back into Yang Ye like a receding tide.

Xiao Yuxi hurriedly walked over to Yang Ye and asked softly, “The Dualism Realm?”

Yang Ye took a deep breath and nodded. He’d finally attained the Dualism Realm. Now, ordinary Rebirth Realm experts were no threat to him.

Xiao Yuxi heaved a sigh of relief when she knew that he’d attained the Dualism Realm. Because Yang Ye’s overall strength had definitely improved tremendously. That represented that Yang Ye would have a better chance at victory against that mysterious power.

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings and asked, “Where’s An Nanjing?”

Suddenly, Xiao Yuxi seemed to have thought of something, and she hurriedly said, “Hurry! They’ve gone ahead.”

Yang Ye was stunned. It didn’t take long for him to recall that ten days had passed.

Yang Ye was about to leave when he suddenly asked, “Where did they go?”

She replied, “Coiling Dragon Mountain!”

Yang Ye asked, “Where’s that?”

Xiao Yuxi was at a loss for words.

It didn’t take long for Yang Ye’s face to become quite unsightly because he didn’t know where it was!

…

Sky Sky Continent wasn’t very peaceful today.

The Emperor Sect.

An unwelcome guest suddenly arrived at the Emperor Sect. It was a woman. She wore a linen dress, and her eyes were closed. Based on her outward appearance, there was nothing special about her.

She went straight into the sky above the Emperor Sect. At the same time, an old man at the Rebirth Realm instantly appeared before her.

The old man gazed at her and frowned, “Who are you? Why have you trespassed into my Emperor Sect’s territory?”

“I’m here for payback!” As soon as she finished speaking, she suddenly opened her eyes. As soon as that happened, a red thread suddenly shot out from each of her eyes. At this moment, the light throughout the sky seemed to have vanished. Or to be more precise, the light in an area of over 10,000km had vanished, and the entire area had fallen into darkness.

The red threads were the only source of light.

The red threads were extremely swift. They shot through the old man’s body before he could even react, and then they shot into the Emperor Sect on the ground below.

Bang!

A loud explosion resounded through the surroundings.

Some time later, light gradually returned to the area above the Emperor Sect. However, the entire Emperor Sect had been transformed into ruins. Moreover, there wasn’t a single living person left there!

Tens of thousands had perished!

…

The War Pavilion.

While the Emperor Sect was being annihilated, two women came to the War Pavilion. One of them had a ghastly pale countenance, and her entire body was filled with monstrous resentment and slaughter intent. As for the other woman, she was riding a huge white pig, and she carried a large saber on her shoulder.

Once they appeared in the air above the War Pavilion, a Rebirth Realm expert from the War Pavilion immediately appeared before them.

That Rebirth Realm expert frowned, “Have we met? Why do both of you look familiar to me?”

“Of course!” The woman with the saber laughed coldly, “Know the Nether Pavilion?”

The old man’s expression changed drastically, “You… you…” He hadn’t even finished speaking when he seemed to have thought of something, and he immediately turned around with the intention of fleeing.

Meanwhile, the woman who rode the pig and the other woman attacked abruptly.

A huge saber tore through the air towards the old man. At the same time, a strand of terrifying slaughter intent and baleful energy instantly enveloped the entire War Pavilion. In an instant, the entire War Pavilion became hell on earth.

The Emperor Sect and War Pavilion weren’t the only ones. Many other powers suffered annihilation at the same time.

It didn’t take long for everyone throughout the continent to be aware that the Nether Pavilion had come back up to the large world!

The Nether Pavilion!

The Nether Pavilion which once instilled fear in countless powers had returned to the large world for payback. So, countless powers felt a sense of danger. At the same time, the other races became vigilant and strictly prohibited their members from entering the Human Territory. Obviously, they didn’t want to get mixed up in all of it!

The Nether Pavilion’s arrival represented that Sky Sky Continent wouldn’t be at peace anymore.

The slaughter was still continuing in the Human Territory, and powers were vanishing from the continent in succession.

…

Four hours later, Blood Maiden and An Nanjing arrived at a mountain range. The mountain range was huge. If one looked down at it from the sky above, one would notice that it was like a huge dragon coiled on the ground.

An Nanjing asked, “They are in there?”

Blood Maiden nodded, “Be careful later!”

They sped up. It didn’t take long for them to stop because a middle aged man with a spear on his back had suddenly appeared in front of them.

An Nanjing had a solemn expression on her face when she saw the middle aged man. She’d met the middle aged man the other day. At that time, she felt that he was extremely dangerous. Now, she still felt that he was extremely dangerous.

“Master wants you to see some things first!” The man vanished on the spot once he finished speaking.

Blood Maiden grabbed An Nanjing’s shoulder and followed the middle aged man.

Around 15 minutes later, Blood Maiden and An Nanjing stopped. There were ten graves not too far away from them. The graves were linked together, and every single one of them had a tombstone. There were words inscribed on the tombstones as well.

There were two words inscribed on the tombstone on the far left — Sky Maiden! The second tombstone had Blood Maiden inscribed on it. The third had Blind Maiden…

The names of all ten of them were inscribed on those tombstones.

The man with a spear on his back gazed at Blood Maiden, “Master said that only all of your corpses are missing.”

Blood Maiden laughed coldly, “Don’t worry, we’ll allow her to understand what it’s like to dig her own grave.” As soon as she finished speaking, she gazed at the middle aged man, “Take me to see your master.”

The middle aged man nodded slightly. He didn’t waste his breath and just started walking off into the distance.

It didn’t take long for them to arrive before a bamboo house. At the same time, a woman holding a feather fan walked out from it.

The woman gazed at Blood Maiden and smiled, “You actually caused such a commotion upon returning. Fortunately, all of it was within my expectations.”

Blood Maiden gazed at the woman for a long time, and then she said, “Fan Yinyu, it’s time to put an end to the enmity between us.”

The woman with a feather fan, Fan Yinyu, nodded slightly, “It should. I made a mistake in my plans and allowed all of you to escape to the lower dimensions. This time, it won’t happen again.”

Blood Maiden said, “All those years ago, we suffered from your schemes and weren’t able to converge together. You crushed us one by one. This time, you’ve specially gathered us here. So, I presume you’re very confident!”

Fan Yinyu grinned, “It’s not about confidence. I just don’t want to waste more time.” She suddenly looked up at the sky and remained silent for a long time, “I don’t sense your eldest sister, Sky Maiden’s, aura. What? Is she still not going to come?”

As soon as she finished speaking, nine rays of light appeared in the sky, and they descended by Blood Maiden’s side. The light dispersed to reveal Blind Maiden and the others.

An Nanjing glanced at them, and her heart shook. Because she noticed that the weakest amongst them was at the Dualism Realm. Or it should be said that only one of them was at the Dualism Realm, and it was the pig riding young woman. As for the rest, even Nether Maiden was in the Rebirth Realm!

All of them were at the Rebirth Realm!

Fan Yinyu glanced at them and nodded, “No wonder you dared to come up here. So it’s because all of you’ve recovered your past strength. Right, it has been so long. If you still hadn’t recovered, then you would really be disappointing.”

She paused for a moment and continued, “Unfortunately, it’s still not enough!”

“Wouldn’t we only know that after we fight?” Blood Maiden stepped forward, “Fan Yinyu, how about we spar for a while?”

Fan Yinyu shook her head, “My opponent is your eldest sister. Only she has the right to be my opponent. I have no intention of insulting you, and it’s merely a fact!”

Meanwhile, the middle aged man with a spear on his back stepped forward, “Blood Maiden, if you want to spar, I can accompany you.”

Blood Maiden glanced at him, and then a blood red ray of light shot forward. It was extremely swift and instantly arrived before the middle aged man.

The middle aged man’s expression didn’t change at all. He clenched his right fist and slammed it forward!

Bang!

An explosion resounded, and the blood red ray of light shattered. Meanwhile, Blood Maiden suddenly appeared before the middle aged man. In an instant, a terrifying wave of pressure slammed down upon him. At the same time, the middle aged man swiftly slapped his palm forward.

Boom!

The space around him shook violently while the pressure Blood Maiden emanated instantly vanished. A moment later, the sound of palms colliding resounded. After that, Blood Maiden returned to where she had been standing, and the middle aged man had moved almost 10m back.

Blood Maiden’s eyes narrowed slightly.

Suddenly, a ray of light appeared in the sky. It didn’t take long for the ray of light to descend by Blood Maiden’s side. The light dispersed to reveal Yang Ye’s figure.

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings and said, “Great! I’m not late!”

Little Sky was naturally the reason why he’d been able to find this place.

Nether Maiden suddenly said, “The Dualism Realm?”

Yang Ye nodded. He sized her up and said, “You’re at the Rebirth Realm?”

She nodded, “I’ve fully recovered my strength.”

Yang Ye nodded slightly. He wasn’t surprised because Nether Maiden wasn’t like him or An Nanjing. After all, Nether Maiden had been a Rebirth Realm expert in the past.

Suddenly, Fan Yinyu said, “Since your eldest sister isn’t coming, then I’ll deal with all of you first. Once I’m done, I think she’ll definitely show herself.”

“Stop!” Suddenly, a voice resounded here.

As soon as the voice finished resounding, a ray of white light flashed from Yang Ye’s chest, and then Little Sky appeared here.

Little Sky glanced at the surroundings. In the end, her gaze descended onto Fan Yinyu, “You can’t fight here! All of you are too strong. If you fight here, you’ll destroy the continent. No, it might even be obliterated!”

Fan Yinyu chuckled, “What if I insist?”

Little Sky suddenly walked towards Fan Yinyu. It didn’t take long for her to arrive in front of Fan Yinyu, and then she looked Fan Yinyu in the eyes, “I’ll kill anyone who dares to fight here!”

As she spoke, she stretched out her hand and tapped Fan Yinyu’s chest, “Do you want to give it a try?”
