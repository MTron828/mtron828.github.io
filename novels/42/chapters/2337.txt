Chapter 2338 – Is Yang Ye Still Alive?

The Sword Ruins.

Jian You fell silent for a long time before sitting down slowly.

Flee?

Actually, she was very well aware that the more Yang Ye tried to flee, the worse it would be for him. Those people who feared him or wanted to take his treasures would never allow such a genius to escape from their fields of vision.

If a genius like Yang Ye was allowed to cultivate behind closed doors for ten years, could anyone endure his revenge?

Moreover, even if Yang Ye fled, he had nowhere to go. Unless he went to the other side of the Eternal River!

However, if Yang Ye did that, he would be giving his life away.

A hopeless situation!

Yang Ye was in a hopeless situation right now.

…

Far away in the sky.

Yang Ye shot through the sky on his sword, and space was torn open in his wake.

The Immortal Estate.

His destination was the Immortal Estate.

Flee?

If fleeing could solve problems, he wouldn’t mind doing so. But he was very well aware that he had nowhere to run. Unless he fled back to the large universe. However, how would he accomplish that without a teleportation formation? And what could he do upon returning?

So long as he refused to hand over the Primordial Pagoda and Primordial Axe of Creation, those powers, including the Immortal Estate, would never let him go.

He understood the situation that he was in, and his choice was mutual destruction!

A sword howl resounded incessantly through the sky.

Suddenly, a ray of sword energy appeared in the distant sky.

Yang Ye frowned and stopped. A moment later, an old man appeared before him.

Yang Ye was surprised, “You?”

The old man was the governor of Sword Sky City, Fen Tianyu.

Fen Tianyu sized up Yang Ye and smiled, “Long time no see, Brother Yang!”

Yang Ye sized up the old man and smiled, “It isn’t wise to come see me now!”

Fen Tianyu shook his head slightly, “It’s fine. I’m here because I have something to give you.”

“Huh?” Yang Ye was quite curious, “What?”

Fen Tianyu grinned and tapped his finger forward, a black rock appeared before Yang Ye, and then a ray of dark light dispersed from it. A short while later, a dark screen of light appeared in front of Yang Ye.

On the screen was an expanse of clouds. Around three breaths of time later, two figures flashed through it.

Yang Ye’s expression instantly changed!

He recognized those figures!

It was An Nanjing and the Martial Emperor!

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly, “Where are they?”

Fen Tianyu spoke solemnly, “World Mountain!”

Yang Ye asked, “What’s that?”

Fen Tianyu replied solemnly, “A teleportation formation that leads to all worlds!”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “All worlds?”

Fen Tianyu explained, “You should be aware that the powers in Eternal Border are from various different universes. Like my Sword Sky City is from a universe called the Eternal Stream Universe. World Mountain is a teleportation formation the great powers of this world jointly built to teleport to all the worlds. The Shiyuan Clan participated in it too. In other words, it can reach the large universe as well.”

Yang Ye asked, “Which universe did they go to?!”

Fen Tianyu replied solemnly, “Divine Martial World!”

Obviously, he knew Yang Ye had never heard of this world, so he took the initiative to explain, “You probably haven’t heard of it. In the beginning, Eternal Border didn’t have its Divine Rankings, the Divine Martial Rankings, but it appeared later on because of a man called Xiao Shenwu. He was from Divine Martial World, and he challenged the experts of Eternal Border once he arrived here. In the end, he practically defeated all of them.”

Yang Ye asked, “What happened after that?”

Fen Tianyu said, “He created the Divine Martial Rankings, and he ranked himself at the 2nd position.”

Yang Ye asked, “So that no one would dare to call themselves the first?”

Fen Tianyu, “That’s what he intended. He can be said to be a legend of Eternal Border. Actually, if you can around 10 years later, you would probably create another legend. Unfortunately, you’re too young right now.”

Yang Ye grinned and spoke softly, “Where did Xiao Shenwu go in the end?”

Fen Tianyu replied, ‘The Eternal River.”

Yang Ye glanced at the sky and said, “Don’t forget to tell me if you get more information about her.”

Fen Tianyu nodded, “Of course.”

He hesitated for a moment at this point and continued, “Young Brother Yang, are you going to the Immortal Estate?”

Yang Ye nodded.

Fen Tianyu spoke softly, “Based on your current strength, if you take a step back now, the Immortal Estate won’t be able to stop you in the future!”

Yang Ye grinned, “That’s what the Immortal Estate and all those fellows in the shadows think. Farewell!”

He transformed into a ray of light that vanished into the sky.

Fen Tianyu was stunned for a moment, and then he laughed bitterly.

He understood now.

Everyone knew that if Yang Ye fled, no one could stop him once he returned. He was very terrifying now, but he would be even more terrifying in the future. So, if Yang Ye fled now, they would all join forces to kill him! They would never give him a chance to flee!

But what if Yang Ye didn’t run?

They wouldn’t join forces, and they would just watch as Yang Ye fought the Immortal Estate, and they would only step forward to reap the rewards once both Yang Ye and the Immortal Estate were heavily injured.

So, Yang Ye would definitely die if he fled, but he had a huge chance to survive if he didn’t.

Fen Tianyu sighed softly and left.

Actually, he hadn’t just come here to tell Yang Ye about An Nanjing, he’d come for another reason, and it was to reveal World Mountain to Yang Ye, so that Yang Ye would flee there and use the teleportation formation there to escape.

Yang Ye would be more useful to Sword Sky City while he was alive!

Unfortunately, this matter was much more complicated than he’d ever imagined.

Two hours later.

Immortal Source Abode.

Immortal Source Above was where the Immortal Estate resided. It was called the Immortal Source Above because it had a spirit vein, a massive spirit vein here. The presence of this spirit vein made the spirit energy in the Immortal Estate far surpass any other place in both purity and amount. Moreover, there was a rumor in Eternal Border that the Immortal Estate’s spirit vein might be on the verge of advancement. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Spirit veins were divided into different levels in all universes. In Eternal Border, they were divided into spirit veins, sacred veins, immortal veins, and divine veins.

Divine veins only existed on the other side of the Eternal River. Because it was impossible to give birth to divine veins without Eternal Energy. Of course, it wasn’t an absolute law. The spirit vein possessed by the Immortal Estate was a sacred vein, and it would become an immortal vein if it advanced further. If it really did advance into an immortal vein, then it would be a source of great fortune to the cultivators of the Immortal Estate.

Cultivation required three things, resources, backing, and talent.

If the sacred vein really became an immortal vein, it would undoubtedly be an extraordinary resource. At the very least, the starting point of the experts from the Immortal Estate would be much, much higher than the cultivators from the other powers.

Once Yang Ye arrived at Immortal Source Above, he sensed how extraordinary the spirit energy here was.

The spirit energy here may be unable to compete with his Primordial Violet Energy, but it was much, much better than the spirit energy available anywhere else. If a person cultivated in such a place from birth, that person would be starting at a much, much higher position than others in the path of cultivation.

Meanwhile, Snowy emerged from Yang Ye’s chest. She glanced at the surroundings, blinked, and seemed to be searching for something.

Yang Ye grinned, patted her on the head, and said, “Head inside for now. Come out again once I’m done with my business here, alright?”

Snowy blinked, and then she pointed into the distance to display that there was a treasure over there.

Yang Ye glanced in that direction and smiled, “We’ll steal it late. Oh, no, I meant we’ll take it later!”

Snowy hurriedly nodded to display her agreement, and then she returned within the Primordial Pagoda.

Once Snowy entered the Primordial Pagoda, Yang Ye looked off into the distance. There was a mountain there that towered into the sky and was surrounded by clouds. Mysterious beasts frequently flew by it, and endless streams of water descended from the edge of its peak. They were like water dragons that painted a magnificent sight.

Around the entire mountain were flying swords that frequently shot by as they circled the entire mountain!

Yang Ye could faintly see an estate at the top of the mountain.

A golden estate!

The Immortal Estate!

The was the number one power on the surface in the Eternal border!

Yang Ye closed his eyes slowly, and a long time passed before he walked slowly toward the mountain.

He walked very slowly as if he was an ordinary person.

Suddenly, countless divine senses descended upon him from time to time.

Suddenly, Yang Ye stopped and turned around, “I’ll kill the next person who sweeps me with their divine sense!”

He glanced coldly into the distance and walked toward the Immortal Estate.

No more divine senses swept toward him.

Once Yang Ye left, a voice came from a point in space, “How arrogant!”

“Arrogant? Hehe, then why don’t you go fight him one on one? What? You don’t dare?” Someone spoke abruptly.

“He’s just an ant!” The first voice spoke coldly, “Let me see how he’ll turn this hopeless situation around!”

Someone asked, “What if he really can?”

“If he succeeds, I, Ye Tianhua, will eat 5kg of shit!” The voice added, “The watery kind!”

Everyone was speechless.

Yang Ye got closer and closer to the mountain, but no one stopped him. Just like that, Yang Ye got closer to the Immortal Estate.

Meanwhile, extremely far away at the Initial Grounds. One of the teleportation formations shook violently, and then a black shadow flashed out from within it. The black shadow was Ling Xu who’d gone to the large universe!

He was also the one and only remaining True Dao Realm expert of the Shiyuan Clan!

Once he emerged, he howled with fury, “Patriarch! Elders! Quickly deactivate the teleportation formation! Hurry! Now!”

However, he received no reply.

Because they weren’t here anymore.

Meanwhile, a young girl suddenly walked out of the teleportation formation.

Ling Xu’s countenance turned pale from the sight of her.

She glanced coldly at the surroundings, and then she waved her right hand.

Bang!

Ling Xu exploded apart and was obliterated!

Countless experts of the Shiyuan Clan were shocked by this!

The young girl closed her eyes slowly, placed her hands behind her back, and remained silent!

A long time passed before a powerful aura enveloped the entire area, and then she suddenly asked, “Is Yang Ye still alive?”
