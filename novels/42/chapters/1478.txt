Chapter 1479 – The Undying Realm!

Nothing was free in this world. She said that she would help him, and it obviously came with conditions. Since she couldn’t accomplish it with her strength, it was definitely impossible for him to accomplish.

So, he asked her if it was free. If it was free, he would naturally not refuse. But if it wasn’t free, then he had to consider the conditions.

His body was at a bottleneck. It would naturally be great if he could advance further. However, it didn’t matter if he couldn’t. In any case, he had the Undying Elemental Body technique, so it wouldn’t be very difficult for him to advance to the Undying Realm in the future.

Suxin replied, “Help me do something!”

I knew it! Yang Ye glanced at her as he’d expected she would say something like that.

Meanwhile, she continued, “It isn’t very difficult for you to accomplish.”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and said, “Senior, it’s not that I refuse to help you, but I’m sure you’ve noticed that I’m just a Voider. Moreover, I only have around two months left to live. Simply speaking, I can’t even take care of myself.”

She shook her head slightly, “Your cultivation is exactly why I feel it won’t be very difficult for you.”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Why?”

She gazed at him and said, “You were able to get here while being at the Voider Realm, and you’re still alive. Just that is enough to explain a lot. I believe that you won’t die here.”

Yang Ye remained silent for a while, and then he spoke solemnly, “Senior, what do you want me to do?”

Suxin looked up at the sky and said, “My husband and I deserve the fate we suffered, and I don’t blame anyone for it. I don’t blame that person as well. I only blame ourselves for being greedy. I’m only worried about my son and daughter. They were still young when we left all those years ago, and I don’t know how they are now.”

Yang Ye glanced at her and said, “Senior, allow me to be honest. Your children... may be much older than I am. I don’t think it’s realistic to make me help them. Because they might be much stronger than I am.”

Suxin shook her head slightly, “I just want you to tell them that they don’t have to look for us. Besides that, they are cultivating the same cultivation technique as my husband and I. However, we were afraid they would seek instant success and rush through their levels of cultivation. So, we didn’t give them our complete cultivation techniques. The cultivation techniques they possess are only sufficient to cultivate to the Deity Realm. Thus, I hope you can give these cultivation techniques to them.”

Yang Ye was quite doubtful, “It’s that simple?”

“Is it?” She withdrew her gaze and looked at Yang Ye, “It’ll be simple if you can leave this place, but is it simply if you can’t?”

Yang Ye’s face froze because he’d almost forgotten that. After all, it was impossible to leave this damnable place!

“But I think you’ll be able to leave!” Meanwhile, she flicked a ray of light into the center of Yang Ye’s forehead, and it didn’t take long for a huge amount of information to enter his mind. It was two cultivation techniques.

A long time passed before Yang Ye looked up at her, “Aren’t you afraid that I would keep them for myself?”

She shook her head, “You won’t.”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Why?”

“You’re a sword cultivator!” She looked him in the eyes and said, “Sword cultivators cultivate the heart. Sword cultivators at your level would never do anything that goes against their beliefs.”

She paused for a moment and continued, “You’re quite cunning and sly unlike other sword cultivators, but I can discern that you’re a man of principle. So, you will definitely not break a promise you’ve made!”

Yang Ye’s impression of her instantly grew quite a bit. Someone who knows how to speak is really different! It felt so nice to hear that!

“The course of life is unpredictable....” Meanwhile, Suxin continued, “I wonder if they are still alive. I hope so....”

Yang Ye asked, “Are they in the large world?”

“The large world?” She was slightly stunned and said, “They are on Darksky Continent. If you get there one day, then look for the Lin Clan. Once you get there, you’ll find them. If... if they are gone, then give those two cultivation techniques to the descendants of the Lin Clan.”

Darksky Continent? Yang Ye nodded, “I’ll definitely visit the Lin Clan if I get there.”

She shook her head slightly and gazed at him, “There are many ways in this world to improve your body’s realm of cultivation. If it was in the past, I would have many methods as well. Yet now, I only have a single method, and it’ll be quite painful. So, you have to endure it.” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“Painful?” Yang Ye chuckled, “Senior, you may not be aware of it but the thing I don’t fear the most is pain.”

Suxin sized him up and said, “As a sword cultivator, you were actually able to improve your body to the Epoch Realm. That’s truly rare indeed. The cultivators who suffer the most in the world are those who cultivate the body. Because they usually have to endure great pain. I presume you’ve endured a great deal of pain as well.”

Yang Ye laughed bitterly. It wasn’t just a great deal; it was a tremendous amount of pain!

Sometimes, it even made him wish that he was dead!

Yang Ye shook his head and asked, “May I know what method you’ll be using?”

Suxin pondered deeply for a moment, and then she suddenly looked up at the sky. She looked for some time, and then she seemed to be slightly infatuated as if she’d thought of something.

Yang Ye glanced at her and didn’t disturb her.

A long time passed before Suxin closed her eyes slowly. A moment later, a soul suddenly floated out from that body. It was the soul of a woman, but its appearance was unlike the body it had been in. It was Suxin’s original appearance.

“There are many ways to attain the Undying Realm, and one of them is to temper the body with the energy of Yin and Yang. However, just a little energy of Yin and Yang isn’t sufficient. Unless... unless....” When she spoke up to this point, Suxin’s soul suddenly transformed into a ray of light that entered Yang Ye’s body.

Once her soul entered his body, his face instantly warped!

It hurt!

Overwhelming pain!

It was much more terrifying than when he suffered backlash from his sword intent. Because he noticed that once Suxin’s soul entered into his body, it wasn’t just his body that felt like it was being pierced by a million needles, his soul felt the same!

It felt like he was about to explode!

At this moment, he felt like his body and soul were about to explode!

At this moment, his body was shivering strangely. It seemed like something was about to emerge from within his skin. Moreover, the veins throughout his face and hand were exposed and wriggling like little snakes! It seemed extremely terrifying!

At this moment, Yang Ye’s mind had become blurry from the pain.

It really wasn’t nice at all!

Moreover, the pain lasted for three days and three nights!

On the fourth day, Yang Ye finally felt slightly better. On the fifth day, his consciousness gradually cleared up. But he felt like he’d been bashed up and was completely powerless.

Huff!

Yang Ye let out a breath of air, and then he started circulating his profound energy. He intended to repair his body. However, he was puzzled because the Primordial Pagoda didn’t help him this time, and it didn’t give him a trace of violet energy. Moreover, he couldn’t utilize his profound energy at all.

What’s going on? Yang Ye was puzzled. But it didn’t take long for him to come to an understanding. At this moment, his body was undergoing a transformation. Obviously, if he used Primordial Violet Energy to heal himself, it would only spoil his transformation!

He had to wait!

He had no choice but to wait!

Just like that, two more days passed. At this moment, Yang Ye felt that his body had recovered quite a bit. He stood up, glanced at his own body, and felt that nothing had changed to his body.

He fell silent for a moment, and then he clenched his fist and slammed it forward!

Boom!

It was like a muffled thunderclap, and the space before him shook violently!

A wisp of excitement flashed through Yang Ye’s eyes. It has improved! My body’s cultivation really has improved!

After that, Yang Ye inspected his body, and he realized that it had indeed improved.

According to his estimations, his current body was comparable to a peak Deity Realm demon beast, and it was almost comparable to the Ancient Emperor Python.

Was it weak?

It was still very weak!

However, that was only in comparison to the Ominous Territory. His body was still weak even if it had improved a realm. After all, the people and demon beasts here were.... But if he was in the outside world, then his body would be heaven defying! Because his current body was even stronger than when the Celestial Demon Lord had executed the Celestial Demon Hegemon Body that day!

Ordinary Deities and demon beasts were of no threat to him at all!

Besides that, the improvement of his body’s realm of cultivation represented that the true form of Heavenrend could grow stronger!

“I never expected her to actually use her soul to improve your body!” Suddenly, a voice resounded in Yang Ye’s ears. Yang Ye looked up and saw that the woman was standing in front of him.

Yang Ye was stunned, “Her soul?”

The woman spoke indifferently, “Her soul at the Dualism Realm entered your body, and then she broke it up into energy of Yin and Yang before utilizing it to stimulate your body and soul. Your current body is at the peak of the Undying Realm. Moreover, your soul has improved tremendously. That’s very beneficial when you attempt to charge into the Semi-Deity and Deity Realms in the future. Especially the Deity Realm. Because your soul would have to be extremely powerful in order to attain the Deity Realm. Other cultivators would have to spend a huge amount of time to specially cultivate their soul before advancing into the Deity Realm. Yet now, you don’t have to do that anymore.”

“No wonder....” Yang Ye felt silent. I really owe her quite a bit.

Suddenly, she asked, “She thinks you’ll be able to leave this place?”

Yang Ye nodded, “She did.”

She asked, “What do you think?”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and said, “I don’t know. However, no matter what, I’ll definitely leave. If I can’t leave, then I....”

Yang Ye was stunned when he spoke up to this point. Because he’d just remembered that an advancement in his body’s realm of cultivation wouldn’t increase his lifespan. Only attaining an advancement in his cultivation would increase his lifespan. If he couldn’t leave, then even if his body advanced by two realms, it would still make no difference!

The woman asked while seeming to be quite interested, “What would you do if you can’t leave?”

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings, “If I can’t leave, then I’ll summon sword energy and blast this place apart.”
