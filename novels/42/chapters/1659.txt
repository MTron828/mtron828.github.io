Chapter 1660 - There’s Always Someone Stronger!

Translator: InVader

He said that he’ll let the Unfettered One launch three strikes before he’ll counterattack! Yang Ye had a weird expression on his face. That’s absolutely arrogant!

No, he was courting death!

Meanwhile, Ku Zhuyi said, “One strike! My seventh uncle couldn’t even resist a single strike from him!”

Yang Ye asked, “Not even one strike?”

Ku Zhuyi nodded, “Not even one. If the experts of my Ku Clan hadn’t acted quickly, my seventh uncle wouldn’t have just lost an arm, he would have lost his life.”

The Unfettered One! Yang Ye laughed bitterly. He hadn’t expected that the Unfettered One had actually come to Milky Way System. But it did make sense because the Unfettered One liked to go around looking for experts to challenge. So, he probably had no other worthy opponent left in the universes around Merak System, so he’d come to the Milky Way System. After all, there were many more experts here.

Meanwhile, Ku Zhuyi added, “From that day onwards, my seventh uncle understood that there’s always someone stronger. That’s also a principle that he frequently teaches us!”

Yang Ye asked, “Where did the Unfettered One go in the end?”

She replied, “According to my seventh uncle, he went to look for the person ranked at the 1st on the Milky Way Rankings at that time.”

Yang Ye felt speechless.

Actually, Yang Ye really admired the Unfettered One. After all, that fellow was extremely formidable. Wherever there were strong experts, there would be legends of him. But Yang Ye only felt admiration.

The Unfettered One had his own Sword Dao, and Yang Ye had his own Sword Dao. Their understanding of the sword was completely different. As for which was stronger, it was obvious that the Unfettered One’s attainments were definitely superior to his own!

However, he didn’t feel any envy.

Because the Unfettered One only had the sword in his life. The Unfettered One could give everything to the sword, but Yang Ye wasn’t the same. As far as Yang Ye was concerned, the sword was just a tool to protect his loved ones, and his sword existed for them.

Becoming stronger was the Unfettered One’s motivation; Yang Ye’s motivation was his loved ones!

Meanwhile, Ku Rong had appeared on the round platform with the violet robed middle aged man’s corpse. After that, he waved his right hand, and the spatial ring on the middle aged man’s hand appeared in his grasp. He made a flicking motion and the Soul Nurturing Tree instantly appeared where it had been.

After he placed it back where it was, Ku Rong turned to look at Yang Ye, “Do you still intend to try?”

Yang Ye replied, “Of course!”

“Then hurry up!” Suddenly, Mo Lin said, “I too want to see how an ant at the Rebirth Realm will heal the Soul Nurturing Tree. If you fail…”

“That’s none of your fucking business!” Yang Ye glanced at Mo Lin, “Old man, you can’t stand the sight of me, and I can’t stand the sight of you too. Once I’m done here, no matter what you want, I’ll accompany you until the end. But can you shut up for now? Stop being so noisy like a woman, alright?”

“You’re courting death!” Mo Lin shouted with fury as a terrifying aura slammed down in Yang Ye’s direction. However, Ku Rong appeared between them before it could arrive in front of Yang Ye, and then he waved his right hand lightly and obliterated the aura.

Ku Rong glanced at them and said, “Please resolve the enmity between you after you leave, alright?”

Mo Lin gruntled coldly, “Brother Ku Rong, I’ll be taking my leave.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he vanished on the spot.

Once Mo Lin left, Ku Rong gazed at Yang Ye and shook his head before he said, “Go give it a try.”

Yang Ye nodded, and then his figure flashed onto the round platform. Suddenly, the tiny vortex started to spin again.

Yang Ye’s eyelids twitched when he sensed this, and he hurriedly said in his heart, “Don’t act rashly! You can’t take that! We won’t be able to leave if you do!”

Even though he was quite confident in his own strength, he wasn’t that confident to think he could fight the entire Ku Clan. Not to mention the Ku Clan, even Ku Rong and Ku Zhuyi were enough to cause him a lot of trouble, let alone the terrifying one-armed man from before.

The tiny vortex gradually slowed down and stopped.

Yang Ye heaved another sigh of relief. He was afraid it would act rashly. Fortunately, it knew its limits, and it knew when it should take and when it shouldn’t.

Once it calmed down completely, Yang Ye walked over to the Soul Nurturing Tree. He gazed at it for a moment, and then he slowly clenched his fist. He was looking at the thing which could save Little Sky! Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Yang Ye fell silent for a moment before he slowly stretched out his right hand. In the end, he placed it on the tree and circulated his profound energy. After that, threads of Primordial Violet Energy surged out from his palm and entered the tree.

Once the Primordial Violet Energy entered the tree, the tree started to tremble violently, and then its branches actually coiled around Yang Ye to stop him from leaving!

Ku Rong and Ku Zhuyi were stunned by this scene, but it didn’t take long for wild joy to appear on Ku Rong’s face. As for Ku Zhuyi, happiness and excitement flashed through her eyes.

Yang Ye glanced at the three and heaved a sigh of relief. Because based on its current reaction, Primordial Violet Energy worked. It did make sense because if even Primordial Violet Energy couldn’t save it, then there would probably be nothing left in the world that could save it.

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts and continued sending Primordial Violet Energy into the tree. Just like that, the tree started to tremble even more violently as more and more Primordial Violet Energy surged into it. Moreover, its roots were recovering at a visible rate.

Ku Rong instantly seemed extremely excited when he noticed this.

Meanwhile, an old man in a luxurious robe suddenly appeared by Ku Rong’s side. Ku Rong was slightly stunned when he saw the old man, and then he hurriedly bowed to the old man, “Third Uncle, what are you doing here?”

The old man didn’t answer Ku Rong, and he just gazed at Yang Ye and the Soul Nurturing Tree, “Who is he?”

Ku Zhuyi said, “He’s from the Yang Clan!”

“The Yang Clan!” The old man nodded slightly and didn’t speak another word. He just stared at the Soul Nurturing Tree without blinking at all.

The roots of the Soul Nurturing Tree gradually returned to normal under the healing effects of the Primordial Violet Energy.

Yang Ye immediately let go of the tree when he noticed that it had returned to normal, and then he turned to look at Ku Rong. He was just about to speak when the old man in a luxurious robe suddenly appeared in front of him. The old man sized up Yang Ye, and then gazed at the tree behind him.

The old man gazed at the tree for a long time before a wisp of excitement flashed through his eyes, “It’s healed! It’s really healed!”

Yang Ye glanced at Ku Zhuyi and smiled, “See, I didn’t lie to you.”

Ku Zhuyi glanced at him and remained silent.

Suddenly, the old man gazed at Yang Ye and said, “Thank you.”

Yang Ye smiled, “It was nothing.”

The old man hesitated for a moment and asked, “Can you tell me what profound energy that was?”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and replied, “A unique profound energy.”

The old man knew when to stop and didn’t pursue a more detailed answer. He immediately gazed at Ku Rong.

Ku Rong nodded slightly and said, “He needs a piece of Soul Nurturing Wood, and I’ve agreed to give it to him if he can treat the Soul Nurturing Tree!”

A piece of Soul Nurturing Wood! The old man in a luxurious robe nodded slightly and said, “Give one to him.”

Ku Rong nodded and left. Around a dozen breaths of time passed before he appeared before Yang Ye again, and he was holding a pitch black branch. It was thick as a finger, around 3m long, and emanated dense Soul Energy.

Ku Zhuyi glanced at Yang Ye when she saw the Soul Nurturing Wood, and a trace of envy flashed through her eyes.

Even though the Ku Clan had a Soul Nurturing Tree, it didn’t have many pieces of Soul Nurturing Wood. Because the Ku Clan could only use the branches that fell from the tree, and they didn’t dare to break its branches off themselves.

They were afraid that breaking its branches themselves would harm the Soul Nurturing Tree, and it was also the reason why it was so precious.

Yang Ye naturally didn’t refuse it and placed it within the Primordial Pagoda, and then he said, “Seniors, I have other matters to attend to. Farewell.”

He intended to leave once he finished speaking. After all, he wanted to immediately revive Little Sky.

However, right when Yang Ye was about to leave, Ku Rong and the old man were stunned because the Soul Nurturing Tree actually obstructed Yang Ye’s path.

Yang Ye was rendered speechless by this scene.

Meanwhile, Ku Rong and the old man exchanged glances, and then Ku Rong stretched out his hand and put the Soul Nurturing Tree back where it had been. However, it only took a moment for the Soul Nurturing Tree to appear in front of Yang Ye again.

Ku Rong and the old man’s expressions became a little unsightly. At this moment, they were naturally able to discern that it wanted to go with Yang Ye.

Yang Ye had naturally realized that as well, and he wanted it to go with him, of course. However, was that possible? Obviously, it wasn’t. Because the Ku Clan would definitely not allow it.

Yang Ye gazed at the old man and Ku Rong, and then the old man and Ku Rong exchanged glances. A moment later, the old man said, “You can go.”

Yang Ye nodded. He tapped his right foot against the ground and transformed into a ray of light that vanished into the sky. The Soul Nurturing Tree was about to follow Yang Ye, but the old man suddenly clenched his fist. In an instant, the space around the Soul Nurturing Tree froze.

Suddenly, the Soul Nurturing Tree shook violently, and then a wave of terrifying Soul Energy surged out from within it. The Soul Energy blasted the space around it into bits, and then the Soul Nurturing Tree shot up into the sky and went after Yang Ye.

Ku Rong and the old man’s expressions instantly became unsightly when they witnessed this.
