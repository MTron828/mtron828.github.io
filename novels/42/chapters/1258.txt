Chapter 1259 – Brother Black! You Take The Rear!

The black ape was blasted away by a single punch, and he flew for over 1km. Even though it was just a little over 1km, it was still extremely terrifying. After all, the black ape’s size was like a small mountain.

The black ape’s figure was covered in fist imprints, and many parts of his body had cracked apart.

The black ape’s face had turned ferocious as well, and his huge eyes flashed with a fierce glow. A moment passed before he slammed his fist at the middle aged man.

A wisp of disdain flashed on the corners of the middle aged man’s mouth. He stomped his right foot against the ground, shot up into the air, and slammed his fist at the black ape’s fist.

The black ape’s fist was almost 100 times larger than the middle aged man’s fist. However....

Bang!

An explosion resounded before the black ape immediately pulled his arm back, and the powerful force of the collision blasted him backwards repeatedly once more. After moving around 100m back, the black ape tapped his right foot against the ground and instantly stopped his figure from being pushed further back. He looked down at his hand, and he noticed that it had warped. It wasn’t just his fingers, even his entire arm had cracked apart and blood was seeping out incessantly from the injuries.

The black ape’s face fell, and he looked up at the middle aged man and said, “You’re much stronger than before.”

The middle aged man started walking towards the black ape, “Hand it over and I’ll spare your life. Otherwise, I’ll kill you!”

The black ape gazed at the middle aged man for a long time, and then he roared furiously before leaping at the middle aged man.

“You’re courting death!” Killing intent flashed through the middle aged man’s eyes when he saw the black ape attack. He stomped his right foot against the ground, and his figure shot up into the air before slamming his fist at the black ape.

Bang!

The middle aged man’s fist slammed against the black ape’s stomach, and a mouthful of blood instantly sprayed out from the black ape’s mouth. His stomach sunk down in an instant while the area around the middle aged man’s fist started to crack swiftly before blood instantly seeped out from those cracks.

A ferocious smile arose on the middle aged man’s mouth. He was about to attack when a colossus appeared out of thin air in the distance. The black ape was instantly stunned at the sight of it, and he saw Yang Ye standing in front of it.

The Void Cloud Shuttle!

The colossus was naturally the Void Cloud Shuttle!

Could he flee?

Of course not!

Yang Ye was no fool. He knew that if he fled, then the black ape might sell him out. The black ape knew he was a sword cultivator, a sword cultivator who could fight Voiders. Just that made it very easy for the black ape to find him. It wouldn’t be a problem if he was all alone, but he had the Sword Alliance as well!

Besides that, he and the black ape could be considered as temporary allies as they were working together now, and Yang Ye wasn’t able to do something like abandoning an ally and fleeing on his own.

But he knew that he was utterly incapable of helping the black ape while being incapable of using his sword. So, he ran over and got Yun Banqing. Why her? Because she knew a little more about Void Cloud Shuttles. After studying it for a while, she’d practically figured out how to control it, and so it was activated.

Yang Ye pointed at the middle aged man and said, “Blast him!”

Yun Banqing spoke from within the control room, “5,000 violet crystals!”

Yang Ye waved his right hand, and 10,000 violet crystals flew into the crystal pillars in the surroundings that were used to store violet crystals. The huge turret at the top of the Void Cloud Shuttle instantly started trembling violently once the violet crystals entered those pillars, and then a beam of dazzling blue light swiftly shot forward. It was so swift that it instantly slammed against the middle aged man in the distance. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Bang!

A loud explosion resounded as the man was instantly blasted away!

“Nice!” A slight smile arose on the corners of Yang Ye’s mouth. Suddenly, his expression changed because the middle aged man had actually started charging in their direction!

“Shoot him!” Yang Ye hastily shouted at Yun Banqing.

As soon as he shouted, another beam of blue light shot forward. It was extremely swift to the point that even Yang Ye was merely able to see a speck of light flash by.

Bang!

A blue beam of light slammed against the middle aged man again. This time, the latter wasn’t blasted back because he slammed his fist at it.

The beam of light shook violently from the impact, and then it cracked apart yet didn’t vanish.

Yang Ye’s eyelids twitched as he stood on the shuttle. He hurriedly gazed at the huge ape, “Brother Black! What are you still standing there for? Get him!”

The black ape was stunned and said, “Gang up on him? That isn’t very nice!”

“Not nice my ass!” Yang Ye was exasperated, “Are you going to attack or not! I’m leaving if you don’t!”

“I’ll do it!” The black ape stopped hesitating when he heard that Yang Ye intended to leave, and he charged at the middle aged man. The middle aged man was resisting the blue beam of light, and his expression changed when he saw the black ape charge at him. He retracted his fist swiftly before slamming his left fist against the blue beam of light. As for his right fist, he slammed it at the black ape who’d arrived before him.

Bang! Bang!

The beam of light was blasted into pieces while the black ape was blasted around 100m away. The middle aged man didn’t chase after the black ape, and he gazed at Yang Ye and said, “Damnable human! I’ll shatter your bones and eat you alive.”

Yang Ye’s eyelids twitched. He waved his right hand and placed another 10,000 violet crystals into the pillars, “Banqing, shoot him! Shoot him to death!” As he spoke, he gazed at the black ape, “Brother Black! Attack him! Kill him!”

Bang!

As soon as Yang Ye gave the order, a beam of blue light shot forward. The middle aged man’s eyelids twitched. He wouldn’t really be fearful if he was just facing that beam of light, but the black ape was there as well. He didn’t have the time to think and immediately slammed his fist against the beam of light, but the beam of light didn’t shatter and blasted him around 20m back instead!

The blue beams of light were extremely strong, and even he couldn’t destroy them with a single punch!

Right when the middle aged man was about to swing his fist again, the black ape had appeared before him and a fist was descending down towards his head.

“Fuck off!” The middle aged man roared with fury and he slammed both his fists forward. He shattered the beam of light once more, and then black ape was blasted away again. Suddenly, another blue beam of light erupted from the Void Cloud Shuttle in the distance, and it instantly slammed against his chest.

Bang!

The middle aged man was blasted away. The black ape would naturally not let such an opportunity slip by, and his figure charged at the middle aged man.

Yang Ye would naturally not allow such an opportunity to slip by as well. He immediately placed another 10,000 violet crystals into the pillars, and then he said, “Shoot him! Shoot him to death!”

As soon as he finished speaking, another beam of blue light shot forward.

The domineering middle aged man was pushed back repeatedly by the joint forces of the Void Cloud Shuttle and the black ape. At this moment, he was practically only able to defend himself and had no chance to fight back. However, Yang Ye’s heart felt like it was bleeding because every single blue beam of energy consumed 5,000 violet crystals!

At this point, he’d exhausted 30,000 violet crystals!

Even though he was very wealthy, it still hurt to spend them like this! But he had no choice because they would be beaten up by the middle aged man if he didn’t utilize the Void Cloud Shuttle!

Even though the middle aged man was in a disadvantaged position, Yang Ye’s face grew even more solemn than before. He’d experienced the black ape’s strength, and it wasn’t weak at all. Coupled with the Void Cloud Shuttle, the middle aged man could be said to be fighting 2 Voiders at once. But he was merely thrown into a disadvantaged situation! How terrifying was such strength!?

“This won’t do!” Yang Ye clenched his fists. Even though he had over 100,000 violet crystals, it wouldn’t take long to exhaust all of that if he used them like this. Once his violet crystals were finished yet the middle aged man wasn’t defeated, then the situation would turn around in an instant.

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment before he withdrew another 20,000 violet crystals and placed them within the pillars. He said, “Banqing, match our rhythm!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he leaped up and shot towards the middle aged man.

He was extremely swift and instantly arrived by the middle aged man’s side, and then he clenched his right fist and slammed it at the middle aged man.

The Brink Laws!

Physical strength at the brink!

Yang Ye knew that if he didn’t utilize the Brink Laws, then striking the middle aged man with his current physical strength would only harm himself.

The middle aged man noticed Yang Ye charging at it, and he was about to attack. However, the black ape suddenly slammed his fist forward as well. At the same time, a blue beam of light shot forward too. The middle aged man decisively chose to give up on defending against Yang Ye’s attack. As far as he was concerned, both the Void Cloud Shuttle and the black ape were stronger than Yang Ye, so he naturally had to defend himself against them.

The middle aged man’s fist slammed forward against the black ape’s fist and the beam of light. Meanwhile, Yang Ye’s fist struck the middle aged man’s head.

Bang! Bang! Bang!

The black ape was blasted away while the blue beam of light was blasted apart. As for the middle aged man, his head shook violently while his figure flew backwards.

Yang Ye roared with fury, “Grab the moment and get him!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye shot over to attack. As for the Void Cloud Shuttle, it shot another blue beam of light at the middle aged man. The black ape didn’t stand by idly, and he charged at the middle aged man.

Because Yang Ye had struck the middle aged man’s head, while Yang Ye’s attack hadn’t been able to kill the middle aged man, it had clearly stunned him. However, he’s still instinctively swung his fist at Yang Ye when Yang Ye charged at him.

Yang Ye’s expression changed. He didn’t dare to exchange blows with the middle aged man, so he hurriedly pulled his fist back, moved aside, and allowed the blue beam of light to go first.

Bang! Bang!

The middle aged man was blasted away by the combined forces of the black ape and the beam of light. Meanwhile, Yang Ye hurriedly charged forward, and his fists stormed down upon the middle aged man.

Just like that, Yang Ye, the black ape, and the Void Cloud Shuttle bashed up the middle aged man for almost 15 minutes!

Bang!

Suddenly, a terrifying aura surged out from within the middle aged man. As soon as this aura appeared, Yang Ye and the black ape were pushed around 1km back, and the blue beam of light before the middle aged man was instantly obliterated!

“All of you deserve death!” As soon as he finished speaking, his body started to transform!

He’s going to return to his true form! Yang Ye and the black ape’s eyelids twitched, and it didn’t take long for the middle aged man to return to his true form.

Yang Ye and the black ape were stunned by the scene before them, and then a moment of silence ensued before Yang Ye suddenly spoke, “Brother Black! You take the rear!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye’s figure vanished on the spot.
