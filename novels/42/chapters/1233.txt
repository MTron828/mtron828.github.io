Chapter 1234 – I’ll Fight You To The Death!

The ground was trembling!

Yang Ye had increased his speed to its limits, and he wished for nothing more than to have 2 more legs.

Behind them was a huge ape that was like a mountain. Yang Ye and Yun Banqing were like 2 ants before it. At this moment, it was pursuing them. Even though its figure was huge, its speed wasn’t slow at all. Every single step it took caused the ground to tremble before it!

Of course, most importantly, the huge ape was at the Voider Realm!

A Voider Realm demon beast!

Cold sweat was streaming down Yang Ye. A Voider Realm demon beast was definitely much stronger than a human Voider. Not to mention that he couldn’t utilize a sword right now, he may not be able to defeat the huge ape even if he could use a sword.

Actually, he’d felt that something was off since he arrived at the gorge. Because a treasure like the Adamantium Fruit was absolutely not something that any demon beast could refuse. However, there was no demon beast guarding it. That was very unusual. So, that was why he’d decisively chose to give up when he saw that old man at the Emperor Realm.

Right when the old man shot towards the tree, a feeling of danger suddenly swept through Yang Ye’s body. So, he didn’t hesitate at all to decisively choose to turn around and flee.

At the instant he fled out of the gorge, the ground throughout the gorge had started to tremble. That wasn’t the ground at all! It was a huge ape lying there! But it had been lying there for so long that it was covered in a thick layer of dirt, rocks, and weeds, causing it to seem like the ground.

No matter how brave Yang Ye was, he couldn’t help but break out in cold sweat when he thought about how he’d actually been standing on a Voider Realm demon beast.

Suddenly, Yun Banqing cried out involuntarily, “It’s growing smaller!”

Yang Ye’s expression changed when he heard her. Even though the huge ape was very swift, its speed was limited by its size. But if it grew smaller, then its speed would definitely improve greatly!

Suddenly, a terrifying aura descended upon them. Yun Banqing’s face was instantly covered in an expression of pain while Yang Ye’s speed slowed down.

Bang!

Yang Ye slammed his right fist against the ground, and an imposing aura shot up into the air. However, it hadn’t even persisted for 3 breaths of time before the huge ape’s aura shattered it.

A wisp of ferocity flashed through Yang Ye’s eyes as he sent a voice transmission to Yun Banqing, “Miss Yun, I’ll keep that fellow busy. You go pull out its Adamantium Fruit Tree!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he didn’t wait for Yun Banqing to reply and immediately grabbed her by the waist before tossing her to the left. It didn’t take long for her to vanish from the limits of his field of vision.

Once Yun Banqing vanished, Yang Ye stopped moving. As soon as he did that, a black fist appeared behind him. It hadn’t even come close to him when the powerful aura it carried obliterated the forest behind him.

Yang Ye turned around swiftly and slammed his fist forward!

Crack!

Yang Ye’s entire arm warped while his figure was blasted away. In the end, he slammed heavily into the ground. But it didn’t take long for him to stand back up, and his face became unsightly when he saw his completely warped arm. If the heavens gave him a chance, he would take back what he’d told Yun Banqing just now.

Keep this fellow busy? He couldn’t do that!

Yang Ye looked up and saw that the huge ape was just a few times larger than a human now. It was completely pitch black, has fist-sized eyes, and a pair of huge and long arms. Especially the muscles on its chest, they were like 2 hills and were filled with a feeling of explosive force.

The aura coming from the black ape was horrifying!

Yang Ye stretched his warped arm while the violet energy within him surged towards it, and then he gazed at the black ape, “I think that this is a misunderstanding. We can sit down and talk about it. Don’t you....”

Suddenly, it leaped forward and slammed its fist at Yang Ye.

Yang Ye’s eyelids twitched. He didn’t dare to go head-on against that fellow with just his fists. He flipped his left hand and a blood red shield appeared in his grasp, and then he raised it against the black ape’s fist.

Bang!

The space around the point of collision shook violently. Meanwhile, Yang Ye who was standing behind the shield spat out a mouthful of blood while his figure was blasted 3km away.

Even though Yang Ye had been blasted away, a trace of surprise arose in the black ape’s eyes. As far as it was concerned, it was truly unusual for a human to be able to resist 2 punches from it! After all, the Emperor from before hadn’t even been able to resist a single punch from it before being completely crushed. But this fellow’s cultivation was much inferior to the Emperor from before....

Yang Ye wiped off the blood on the corner of his mouth, and then he looked at his left arm. At this moment, his entire arm was numb, and he couldn’t feel it at all.

Now, he knew the gap between his physical body and the body of a Voider Realm demon beast!

Yang Ye looked up at the black ape. How should I fight such a battle? I can’t! He could give it a try if he could use his sword, but the problem was that he couldn’t! If he used his sword, then it might summon an existence that was even more terrifying than the black ape. At that time, he would truly be finished.

Flee?

He wanted to, but he had to buy time for Yun Banqing!

Since he couldn’t flee, he could only fight!

Yang Ye glanced at his right hand. It had returned to normal now. He flipped his right palm and the Emperor Rank fan appeared in his grasp. He waved it through the air, and it stretched open before a beam of white light shot out from it. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

The black ape didn’t try to dodge and just allowed the beam of light to strike its chest.

Bang!

The beam of light vanished, and the black ape remained completely unharmed.

Yang Ye was speechless.

Meanwhile, the black ape suddenly leaped forward and shot at Yang Ye like a cannonball.

Yang Ye’s eyelids twitched, and he flicked a drop of Blood Essence into the blood red shield. A ray of dazzling blood red light instantly erupted from the shield, and it didn’t take long for a blood red barrier to appear around the shield. Yang Ye bit his teeth, stomped his right foot against the ground, and slammed the shield at the black ape.

The black ape swung its fist forward in midair and struck Yang Ye’s shield.

Bang!

An explosion resounded through the surroundings. The blood red barrier on the shield shattered in an instant, and then Yang Ye was blasted away with his shield.

This time, the black ape didn’t stop, and it shot at Yang Ye before slamming its fist at Yang Ye again.

Yang Ye’s expression changed when he saw the black ape charge over. He put the folding fan away before clenching his fist tightly, and then the space around him instantly started to crack apart. A moment later, Yang Ye swung his fist at the black ape’s fist.

Bang!

Yang Ye was blasted away again. But this time, the black ape was pushed around 30m back as well!

Once his figure stopped flying backward, Yang Ye felt that his entire body was in bad shape. His entire body was numb, and he even felt slightly dizzy. It was especially so for his arm because he couldn’t feel it right now.

He looked up at the black ape. Even my strength at its brink isn’t able to harm that fellow? How am I to fight him?

Meanwhile, the black ape glanced at its own fist. This time, it wasn’t surprise that appeared in its eyes, it was slight shock. Because a human had actually exchanged a blow with it while using physical strength and had even pushed it back. That was the biggest insult to it! So, when it looked up at Yang Ye again, there was a trace of curiosity and ferocity in its eyes.

Their gazes collided, and then Yang Ye suddenly howled with fury, “I’ll fight you to the death!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye stomped his right foot against the ground while his figure shot forward like a cannonball. Once he arrived in the air above the black ape, a ray of blood red light suddenly surged out from within him.

Void Rank slaughter intent!

As soon as his Void Rank slaughter intent surged out, Yang Ye immediately started to condense it. In an instant, a terrifying wave of pressure knocked the black ape almost 100m back. It didn’t take long for an invisible wave of force to press down upon the black ape.

The black ape’s eyes narrowed slightly. It didn’t move away, and it just clenched its fist slowly before slamming it forward.

Bang!

A terrifying wave of energy swept out from the area before the black ape, and the black ape was pushed back repeatedly by it. However, just a moment passed before it slammed its fist forward again, and then the wave of energy before it was instantly obliterated!

Yang Ye’s eyelids twitched at the sight of this. That fellow is really invincible. Both my physical strength and Void Rank slaughter intent at the brink can’t harm it. How am I to fight it?

The black ape was about to attack again, but it suddenly turned to look towards the distance, and then a vicious expression flashed through its eyes. It suddenly roared with fury, turned around, and charged off into the distance!

Yun Banqing succeeded! Yang Ye was delighted by the sight of this, and then his heart constricted when he saw the black ape turn around and run off. He had to buy time for Yun Banqing to flee!

Yang Ye didn’t hesitate to charge at the black ape, and he even shouted as he pursued it, “You’re running since you can’t defeat me? I look down on you! Come on! Let’s exchange another 300 blows!”

Yang Ye’s full speed was slightly superior to the black ape, so it didn’t take long for him to catch up. After that, he clenched his fist tightly and slammed it at the black ape’s head.

Meanwhile, the black ape stopped, turned around, and swung its fist at Yang Ye. Yang Ye’s eyelids twitched at the sight of this, and he hurriedly pulled his fist back. After that, he held the blood red shield with both hands and raised it against the black ape’s fist.

Bang!

The blood red shield trembled violently while Yang Ye was blasted away again. But the black ape paid no attention to Yang Ye, and it just turned around and ran. But at this moment, Yang Ye charged once more in its direction.

Just like that, the man and beast fought as they ran, and it didn’t take long for them to return to that gorge. But at this moment, the Adamantium Fruit Tree on the mountain wall was gone.

The black ape was stunned by the sight of this, and it didn’t take long for killing intent and a vicious aura to surge out from it.

“Roar!” It roared furiously into the sky, and its roar swept far and wide. Even the mountains in the surroundings collapsed before the sound of its roar.

Yang Ye gulped. He was about to charge forward, but he started to retreat instead. Meanwhile, the black ape suddenly gazed at him.

Yang Ye’s eyelids twitched while he said, “Err... err.... I’ll let you win today. Let’s fight again another day....”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye turned around and fled!
