Chapter 2529 – Unexpected!

Shangyun Xian and Shangyun Xin couldn’t help but shoot a glance at Yang Ye. They felt that this guy before them was a little too bold!

Meanwhile, the white clothed figure floated into the city toward them.ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Shangyun Xin hesitated for a moment and asked, “Should we leave first?”

He couldn’t see through the white clothed figure at all!

Yang Ye smiled, “Calm down, let’s see what they are trying to do.”

Shangyun Xin glanced at the composed expression on Yang Ye’s face and felt relieved. As far as he was concerned, this young man from the Ancient Sword Sect definitely had some kind of trump card.

Meanwhile, the white clothed figure had arrived just around 3m away from them and stopped there.

The white clothed figure said, “Join my Soul Sect and gain eternal life!”

The Soul Sect!

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed, “What if I refuse?”

The white clothed figure replied, “Die!”

As soon as he finished speaking, a gust of cold winds enveloped Yang Ye’s group.

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and said, “I’m a disciple of the Ancient Sword Sect, so it will definitely not agree to me joining the Soul Sect!”

The white clothed figure replied, “The Ancient Sword Sect, perish!”

Yang Ye was shocked because the Soul Sect was clearly targeting the Ancient Sword Sect!

It made him wonder how strong these sects were!

Meanwhile, Sword Scroll spoke indifferently, “So long as the sect master is alive, they won’t be able to annihilate the Ancient Sword Sect.”

Yang Ye spoke solemnly, “But he was heavily injured all those years ago, right?”

She fell silent.

Meanwhile, the white clothed figure added, “Join my Soul Sect and gain eternal life!”

Sword Scroll’s voice resounded right after that, “Immediately notify the Ancient Sword Sect and tell them to get ready.”

Yang Ye nodded, “But we have to deal with this first. Otherwise, the people in this city will be in danger!”

He seemed to have thought of something at this point, and Yang Ye laughed with self-ridicule. In the past, he specialized in slaughtering cities, but now, it had all changed.

Meanwhile, the white clothed figure spoke once more, “Join my…”

However, the white clothed figure hadn’t been able to finish speaking when a sword flashed, and then the white clothed figure’s head flew up into the air!

This time, the white clothed figure wasn’t just acting like a ghost, the white clothed figure had really been turned into one!

Shangyun Xian and Shangyun Xin were stunned on the spot!

Yang Ye ignored them, and he just flipped his right palm. A seal appeared there. It was the Universe Seal!

The old man with the bamboo chest had said that it could undo all formations and barriers!

Yang Ye flicked the Universe Seal into the air, and it only took a moment for a mysterious wave of energy to sweep through the sky. A short while later, the mist in the sky gradually started to vanish!

Yang Ye waved his right hand, and the Universe Seal returned to him. After that, he flicked a transmission talisman into the air, but it didn’t take long for the transmission talisman to vanish!

Yang Ye’s face turned gloomy when he sensed this.

Someone had stopped his transmission again!

Yang Ye looked up at the sky, and a pitch black spear suddenly shot down from the clouds. The might of it caused the entire city to tremble!

If it descended into the city, it was obvious that the city would be obliterated!

Yang Ye patted the Sword Gourd lightly. In an instant, a sword shot up into the sky and struck the spear, causing it to be unable to descend another inch!

Yang Ye flicked his fingers gently, and then another flying sword shot up into the air and blasted the spear back into the clouds.

A black robed man stood in the clouds with a spear in hand!

The black robed man looked down and said, “Interesting. I didn’t expect the Ancient Sword Sect to have someone like you. It is a mistake in our strategy.”

Yang Ye spoke indifferently, “What’s your name?”

The black robed man appeared in the sky above the city, “You’re not bad, so how about joining my soul sect?”

Yang Ye replied, “Can I be the master of it? If that’s the case, I can consider joining!”

The black robed man shook his head, “Looks like you seek death. You…”

Suddenly, his voice stopped abruptly. Shangyun Xian and Shangyun Xin watched with astonishment as the black robed man’s head fell off his neck!

Both of them immediately gazed at Yang Ye!

A wisp of sword energy dimmed down on the gourd by Yang Ye’s waist!

Both of them were beyond shocked at this moment!

An instant kill!

An instant kill again!

Yang Ye waved his right hand, and the black robed man’s spatial ring flew over to him. There were around 100 World Crystals within it!

He’d gained quite a bit!

Yang Ye glanced at Shangyun Xian and Shangyun Xin, “It’s an organization called the Soul Sect that’s behind all of this. They aren’t something you can go against. I’ve notified the Ancient Sword Sect, so they will be here soon.”

As soon as he finished speaking, a few rays of light shot down from the sky, and then two middle aged men and an old man appeared before them.

All three of them glanced at Yang Ye, and they had rather strange expressions on their faces.

One of them was Kong Ming, the outer court elder Yang Ye had a small conflict with in the past, and the group was led by the inner court elder, Elder Xu!

Shangyun Xin hurried over to greet them, “Elder Kong Ming!”

In the eyes of clans like theirs, the outer court elders of the Ancient Sword Sect were existences who held real authority because such elders could recruit outer court disciples.

Elder Kong Mind nodded, and then he gazed at Yang Ye and bowed slightly, “Junior Sect Master!:

Even Elder Xu and the other elder bowed to Yang Ye.

It could be said that besides the sect master, grand elder, and a few other older seniors of the sect, everyone else in the Ancient Sword Sect had to bow upon meeting the junior sect master!

The Ancient Sword Sect was serious!

Shangyun Xian and Shangyun Xin were flabbergasted when they witnessed this scene.

The junior sect master!

They gazed at Yang Ye with astonishment. They hadn’t expected the young man before them to actually be the junior sect master of the Ancient Sword Sect!

It didn’t take long for Shangyun Xin to laugh bitterly. Actually, it made sense. Someone with such strength at such an age was bound to be extraordinary!

He knew he’d been blind and ignorant!

Yang Ye nodded slightly and said, “What did the Grand Elder say?”

Elder Xu replied solemnly, “It is the Soul Sect. Elder Xue and the Grand Elder have started to contact the other clans and the Central Region’s Xing Clan. We haven’t received their replies yet.”

Yang Ye frowned slightly, “This won’t do. The Ancient Sword Sect should be the Soul Sect’s target, so we can’t entrust our hopes to others!”

Elder Kong Ming and Elder Xu exchanged glances. In the end, Elder Xu asked, “Then what should we do?”

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings, “Order our intelligence network to immediately start investigating the entire West Region. So long as experts of the Soul Sect are spotted, report it immediately to me. Since they want to target us, then we don’t have to show mercy. We’ll kill every one of them we see. Morale, we must raise our morale, and we must show them that they should have never touched us. Because they’ll have to pay a horrible price for doing so!”

Elder Xu and the others’ blood started to boil when they heard him!

Overbearing!

They exchanged glances, and then Elder Xu said, “I’ll get it done.”

He seemed to have thought of something and added, “The Soul Sect isn’t ordinary. You must be careful, Junior Sect Master!”

Yang Ye nodded, “You too.”

They bowed slightly to Yang Ye and left.

Once they left, Yang Ye gazed at Shangyun Xin and Shangyun Xian, “You be careful too!”

He gazed at Shangyun Xian and continued, “If you want, you can go report in to the Ancient Sword Sect.”

Shangyun Xian nodded, “I-I will!”

Yang Ye didn’t say anything else and just left the city!

Shangyun Xian suddenly said, “Second Uncle, he’s so strong!”

Shangyun Xin shook his head and smiled, “Could he have become the junior sect master if he wasn’t? But I’m quite curious. After all, the Ancient Sword Sect hasn’t had a junior sect master for a long time, so why did it suddenly choose one?”

Shangyun Xian spoke softly, “I don’t know. But this junior sect master is very charismatic!”

Shangyun Xin smiled and didn’t say anything in response to that.

…

In the clouds, Yang Ye sat cross-legged in midair and entered the Primordial Pagoda.

Meanwhile, Sword Scroll appeared by Yang Ye’s side, “Don’t underestimate the Soul Sect!”

Yang Ye replied, “I won’t!”

Sword Scroll nodded, “It’s a very extreme and evil organization. They often use souls as sacrifice. This time, they are targeting the Ancient Sword Sect, and there’s definitely a reason for it. Otherwise, they would absolutely not dare to rashly attack an ancient power like it!”

Yang Ye spoke solemnly, “You’re right. It’s either that there’s something wrong in the Ancient Sword Sect, causing them to intend to take advantage of the opportunity; or their strength is far stronger than before, so they’ve decided to start with the Ancient Sword Sect!”

He shook his head, “I just took this position, and they’ve created trouble for me. They really do think highly of me!”

Sword Scroll smiled, “If the Soul Sect knew you were the Ancient Sword Sect’s junior sect master, I don’t think they would dare to rashly attack the Ancient Sword Sect!”

Yang Ye’s character was the strangest she’d ever encountered. He was usually an absolutely normal person who was easy to talk to, but once he wasn’t normal, he was absolutely not normal.

Yang Ye shook his head and smiled, “How’s your main body’s repairs going?”

She replied, “Its form has been recovered, but its essence is lost. I can’t do anything about that, or I should say that if I do it, it would take thousands of years. We’ll have to rely on Snowy for it.”

Snowy!

Yang Ye nodded, “They’ve been gone for some time, so they should be back soon. We’ll get her to repair your main body once she gets back!

Sword Scroll was about to say something when Yang Ye suddenly left the Primordial Pagoda as a voice transmission had arrived for him.

A short while later, a solemn expression appeared on his face.

The Ancient Sword Sect’s master was dead!

It was a voice transmission from Elder Xue! And she wanted him to return immediately and manage the sect!
