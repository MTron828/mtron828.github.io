Chapter 2453 – Zi’er!

Yang Ye started to cultivate the Divine Avatar Technique!

Needless to say, it was truly quite unique. But just as Huang Tianxing had said, it’s dangerous, very dangerous!

Splitting the body wasn’t difficult, but splitting the soul was very, very difficult.

Splitting the soul into two!

If he didn’t have the Primordial Pagoda, then the slightest mistake would lead to eternal damnation! Even when he had the Primordial Pagoda, Yang Ye didn’t dare to act carelessly.

Cultivation was a long and dull process.

In the Primordial Pagoda, Yang Ye tried over and over again. In the beginning, he kept failing. He just kept encountering different issues because even if he made a clone, he had to control it himself.

At that time, it would be equivalent to controlling two bodies!

That was the most difficult part about it!

Yang Ye failed and tried again, over and over again…

While Yang Ye cultivated, An Nanjing and Erya were cultivating too. Or to be more precise, Oxxy was too.

Oxxy and Erya were learning combat techniques from An Nanjing!

As for the Primal True Dragon, Primal Vicious Tiger, and the others, their physiques determined that they couldn’t learn human combat techniques! Erya and Oxxy had only two legs, so their physiques were no different than that of the humans!

But the Primal True Dragon and the others were different! While they could take human form, it would actually make them lose the advantage they had!

Under An Nanjing’s guidance, Erya’s strength grew increasingly terrifying!

Presently, she didn’t just possess brute strength, even An Nanjing had to be careful when sparring with her!

As for Oxxy, An Nanjing was really quite helpless. That fellow could only grasp a few techniques no matter how she taught him. In the end, An Nanjing had no choice but to make Oxxy madly practice those moves.

Slash, sweep, angled chop!

Oxxy was just madly practicing with these three moves.

It did come with results. Especially when Oxxy was using a Divine Treasure. Oxxy was capable of fighting most demons, even existences like the Primal True Dragon. No matter how powerful the Primal True Dragon was, the axe could pierce its defenses! As for existences like Erya, Oxxy could only dream of fighting her. The gap between the demons and Erya was quite huge. Obviously, they’d realized it and started to work hard on their cultivation!

They couldn’t be a burden!

It was something Snowy wanted.FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Moreover, they didn’t want to get left behind. They would be ashamed to be weak and useless here.

Demons had their own pride!

As for Snowy, she didn’t know what cultivation was. Or it should be said that sleeping every day was cultivation to her.

At the rear mountains of the Sword Sect, Snowy stared at the two Chaotic Fruit Trees in the small forest there.

They were about to ripen!

While these fruits were great, they weren’t that important to Snowy. The only reason she was painstakingly cultivating them was those demons in the Primordial Pagoda. It wasn’t just because they could help Yang Ye, it was because she treated them as her loved ones. She never forgot the day Oxxy and the Primal True Dragon had risked their lives for her!

Actually, everything went both ways. Snowy was good to them, and they never forgot that. Especially Oxxy. If it wasn’t for Snowy, he would have never possessed such strength.

At most times, the relationship between demons was purer. If you were good to me, I would be good to you.

Snowy waited for almost an hour before the trees. Finally, they trembled, and then those six fruits fell from the tree and floated over to Snowy!

It was their way of repaying her!

Actually, Snowy wasn’t aware that the fruits of the Chaotic Fruit Tree had been historically difficult to obtain, and it was as difficult as ascending the heavens. Only top-rate experts had the ability to pluck their fruits. But in this place… If it was described in a more realistic manner, then if they refused to give the fruits to Snowy and infuriated her, then not only would they be unable to keep their fruits, they may even lose their lives!

The trees were very smart and took the initiative to give Snowy their fruits.

So long as Snowy helped them, they would have a better future, and it was a future that absolutely couldn’t be compared to a few fruits.

Snowy took the fruits, cracked a smile at the trees, and then vanished into the distance.

The trees swayed along with the wind.

Snowy pranced along the way with the fruits, and it didn’t take long for her to arrive before a hall.

Its door opened and a woman in a violet dress walked outside!

It was Zi’er!

She was at the Limitbreaker Realm now!

It could be said that Snowy had forcefully pulled her cultivation up to this level. Even Zi’er’s ancestors had probably not attained such accomplishments. Zi’er had overcome her bloodline, and now as an ancestor herself, she possessed a new bloodline! Of course, her combat strength was still much more inferior to Oxxy, the Primal True Dragon, and the others. But she was very satisfied. The increase in her lifespan meant that she could stay with Yang Ye for longer!

There was a form of happiness called accompaniment!

Being able to accompany your loved ones was a very happy thing!

Snowy raised a fruit in Zi’er’s direction, and there was a brilliant smile on her chubby little face.

She, Zi’er, and the Sword Precursor had been with Yang Ye the longest! Especially Zi’er, she’d been with him since he’d been a labor disciple.

Zi’er rubbed Snowy’s head and smiled, “My Snowy isn’t so mischievous anymore!”

Snowy used to be an utterly unruly child who was absolutely mischievous. While she was still quite mischievous, it was much, much better now. At the very least, she didn’t cause trouble anymore.

Once Zi’er took the fruit, Snowy hugged Zi’er head and rubbed her head against it. After that, she vanished into the distance.

Zi’er shook her head and smiled, and her heart felt very warm as she gazed at the fruit.

Once Snowy left, a voice resounded, “Zi’er!”

Zi’er’s figure trembled slightly, and then she looked over to see Yang Ye had appeared over there.

Zi’er gazed at him and suddenly cracked a smile. It was like a thousand flowers blooming in unison. It was absolutely gorgeous.

Yang Ye walked over to Zi’er, and they just sat on the stone stairs outside the pavilion while holding hands!

Yang Ye gazed at the sky and spoke softly, “Do you remember our first meeting?”

Zi’er nodded. The first impression she had of Yang Ye when she saw him was—what a weak human!

Yang Ye didn’t say anything else. He just hugged her and sat there.

The memories of the past flashed within their minds.

Yang Ye’s gaze gradually turned icy cold from an original gentle state.

In this world where only the strong were respected, the only way for one’s loved ones to live well with dignity was to be stronger than everyone else.

Yang Ye glanced at Zi’er who was resting on his shoulder. He refused to let anyone destroy all of this.

He left the happy side to his loved ones, and the cruel side for himself to face!

They just hugged each other tightly on the stone stairs.

…

On the Ascension Platform, Snowy summoned Oxxy and the others!

They gazed at Snowy, or to be more precise, they were looking at the four fruits in front of Snowy.

Snowy pointed at the fruits, and then pointed at Oxxy and the others. She was saying each of them would get one!

Oxxy hesitated for a moment and walked over first. After that, he took one of the fruits and walked quietly to the side. Since Snowy told them to come get it, he would! Of course, he really wanted it too.

Once they saw Oxxy take one, the others didn’t hold back and went to claim their own fruit.

The most excited were the Martial Qilin and Primal Vicious Tiger. If they hadn’t encountered Snowy, they would probably never get such fruits.

Once they took the fruits, Snowy pranced off into the distance. Obviously, she was going to give Erya a fruit.

The demons exchanged glances and left.

If they were deep within the mountains, they would definitely fight for these fruits, but they didn’t do that here. It wasn’t because of Yang Ye’s deterring force or Snowy, it was because they’d fought together all this time.

They had become friends!

…

Meanwhile, Erya was still fighting An Nanjing. An Nanjing way of training was through fighting, guidance while fighting! Moreover, she would stop after fighting for a while and point out Erya’s shortcomings!

Under such circumstances, Erya’s improvement was naturally huge, and her ability to learn was outstanding too.

Erya and An Nanjing stopped when they saw Snowy. They gazed at her, and she tossed the fruit over to Erya.

Erya wiped off the sweat on her face and said, “Snowy, aren’t you going to have a little?”

Snowy shook her head.

The fruit wasn’t tasty, and Snowy only ate things based on how delicious they were, not their level of preciousness!

Erya licked her lips and gazed at An Nanjing, “Big Sister An, can I eat this fruit first?”

She felt heartfelt respect for An Nanjing.

An Nanjing nodded and walked away.

Once An Nanjing left, Erya started gobbling down the fruit, and she spoke while she ate, “Big Sister An said that I must grow stronger because many people in the world outside want you for themselves. Snowy, do you know why?”

Snowy shook her head.

Erya took another huge bite and said, “Big Sister An said you’re the Sprite Progenitor. Do you know what that is?”

The Sprite Progenitor?

Snowy shook her head again!

Erya grunted coldly, “I don’t know either.”

She snuck a glance at the surroundings and continued, “Snowy, let me tell you a secret. I’ve been having lots of dreams lately. I dream that I’m really powerful. How powerful? I can kill people like Big Brother Yang with a single swing of my claws! Don’t tell Big Brother Yang or he’ll beat me.”

Snowy blinked and passed a tanghulu to her.

Erya licked it and said, “Don’t worry, Snowy. Butcher said that I should be loyal when I roam the world! Snowy, you’re my best friend, so if anyone tries to take you, they’ll have to go over my dead body!”

Erya’s face was extremely serious as she spoke those words.

She wasn’t joking!
