Chapter 2117 – Until Death!

Was it really limitless?

Yang Ye wasn’t sure. But he was certain that Tian Xiu was really extraordinary.

She was a young girl that even the Primordial Pagoda feared.

Of course, her relationship with the pagoda was very good now, and Snowy had contributed greatly to that end.

Tian Xiu was quite depressed when she found out that she couldn’t cultivate.

Snowy went over to her and started waving her claws.

Yang Ye smiled, “Snowy is right. While you can’t cultivate, both of us will protect you. No one can harm you while we’re here.”

Tian Xiu smiled, and the gloominess on her face vanished.

At most times, children were like an empty piece of paper, and how they turned out in the future depended on what the adult wrote on that paper. Under Snowy’s influence, Tian Xiu was almost only capable of being cute.

Ten days passed in the Primordial Pagoda.

Yang Ye left the pagoda on the 11th day because he had a guest.

It was a young monk.

The monk walked over to Yang Ye and bowed slightly to him, and then he sat crossed-legged before Yang Ye, “Master Yang, I’m Zhi Yan. I’m here to seek guidance from you.”

Yang Ye asked, “Are we deciding on life and death or just the victor?”

Zhi Yan fell silent for a moment and said, “Your desire to kill is too strong. I’m afraid that isn’t a good thing.’

Yang Ye smiled, “Monk Zhi Yan, have you killed anyone?”

Zhi Yan nodded, “Of course. However, they deserved death, so I don’t feel any guilt from it.”

Yang Ye shrugged and said, “As far as I’m concerned, I only kill those who deserve death, and I don’t feel any guilt from killing them. So, is there anything different between us?”

Zhi Yan glanced at Yang Ye and said, “Master Yang, you really have a sharp tongue. Anyway, do you prefer to decide on life and death, or just the victor?”

Yang Ye smiled, “It doesn’t matter to me.”

Zhi Yan nodded slightly, “Master Yang, you’re a sword cultivator, and I just happen to study the sword too. Let’s compete in the sword today, alright?”

Yang Ye asked, “You’re the Sword Buddha?”

Zhi Yan replied, “I didn’t expect you to have heard of my name.”

Yang Ye replied, “Alright, let’s not waste time!”

Zhi Yan nodded, and then he raised his palm. A golden bowl appeared in his palm, and then it shook violently before transforming into a ray of light that enveloped the temple.

At this moment, Yang Ye felt like the temple was fortified like a fort.

Zhi Yan stood up slowly, “Master Yang, I’ve gained some new comprehension in the Sword Dao lately, and I think the Sword Dao is best the simpler it gets. It doesn’t need to be that complicated. What do you think?”

Yang Ye replied, “I’m the complete opposite. I think that making it complicated is necessary at times.’

“Oh?” Zhi Yan glanced at Yang Ye, “That does arouse some anticipation in me.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he tapped his finger in Yang Ye’s direction.

He used his finger as a sword!

Sword intent!

Yang Ye sensed endless sword intent assault him, and as soon as it arrived before him, it converged together. At this moment, its strength had improved by countless times.

Yang Ye didn’t dodge it, he just tapped with his finger as well.

Zhi Yen didn’t sense any sword intent or sword energy from Yang Ye, but as soon as Yang Ye’s finger tapped against the sword intent, Zhi Yan’s expression changed drastically.

Bang!

Zhi Yan’s sword intent was instantly obliterated, and Yang Ye’s finger arrived before Zhi Yan’s forehead.

The latter’s eyes narrowed slightly. He twisted his right hand slightly and transformed into a ray of light that moved around 3m back. While it was just a short distance, it just happened to avoid Yang Ye’s finger.

Zhi Yan glanced at Yang Ye and said, “Using a certain point to break the entirety. Amazing!”

Yang Ye replied, “There’s no need to probe me. Just get serious.”

Zhi Yan nodded, “Let’s just compete in the sword and not energy, alright?”

A competition of the basics!

Yang Ye understood what Zhi Yan wanted, and he didn’t refuse. He nodded, “Bring it.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Zhi Yan appeared in front of Yang Ye. At this moment, there was a silver sword in Zhi Yan’s grasp, and it was around 30% longer than an ordinary sword, and it was much thinner too. The sword shot straight for Yang Ye’s chest. It didn’t carry any fluctuations of profound energy and was just a pure attack.

When it arrived a few inches away from Yang Ye’s chest, Yang Ye suddenly attacked. He didn’t defend himself but stabbed at Zhi Yan’s chest too.

He planned to suffer an injury and inflict one at the same time!

Zhi Yan was quite surprised by this. Because he hadn’t expected Yang Ye to do this. Moreover, the moment Yang Ye chose just happened to be when he couldn’t pull his sword away and defend himself. So, he couldn’t retreat and could only exchange injuries with Yang Ye.

Bam! Bam!

Two muffled sounds resounded, and then both of them were pushed far backwards.

Both of them were fine!

The clothes on Zhi Yan’s chest had shattered, but the golden skin beneath it was dazzling like solid gold.

The Gold Form!

The Gold Form of the Buddhist Path!

Yang Ye said, “I didn’t expect you to be cultivating in the body and sword too!”

Zhi Yan said, “Of course, how would I fight you in close quarters if I don’t?”

As soon as he finished speaking, he vanished on the spot again. At the same time, a sword arrived before Yang Ye’s throat. However, it stopped around half an inch before Yang Ye’s throat. It was because Yang Ye’s left hand had grabbed the blade of this sword. But just a moment passed before Zhi Yan twisted it with his right hand, and it escaped Yang Ye’s grasp and shot at Yang Ye’s throat.

Hiss!

The sound of air being sliced open resounded.

Zhi Yan’s expression changed slightly. He turned around and swung his sword.

Bang!

An explosion resounded, and then both of them moved backward. Meanwhile, Yang Ye chose to seize the initiative and attack.

What was the most important thing in a battle? Many would say it was technique or strength. But as far as Yang Ye was concerned, it was being ruthless.

If one was ruthless enough, one’s aura would crush the opponent.

Yang Ye wasn’t even doing it on purpose, he was ruthless to the bone. His experiences when he was young told him that good people are bullied, and while one could remain kind, one couldn’t be too kind. Many people in society didn’t dare to bully bad people, but they dared to bully good people. Why? Because good people were easy to bully. So, he’d learned that a person couldn’t stand up straight in society without being ruthless!

Yang Ye appeared in front of Zhi Yan. He stabbed repeatedly at Zhi Yan like a madman, and every attack targeted a weak point on Zhi Yan’s body. As for Yang Ye himself, he abandoned his defenses. Under such circumstances, Zhi Yan didn’t dare to defend himself and entered into an intense battle at close quarters with Yang Ye.

Even though both of their defenses were extremely formidable, their swords were even stronger, and it could pierce through the other’s defenses.

Blood sprayed all over!

As time went by, the battle which had been equally matched in the beginning was gradually transforming into a battle where Yang Ye was suppressing Zhi Yan.

Yang Ye was like a wild beast that grew stronger as the battle progressed.

Around an hour later!

Boom!

A loud explosion resounded, and then a figure was blasted away. The figure flew all the way and slammed against the wall.

Bam!

At this moment, the entire temple trembled. It was Zhi Yan’s figure that had slammed against the wall. However, he stood up as soon as he fell to the ground. But at this moment, Yang Ye was in front of him, and Yang Ye’s knee slammed against Zhi Yan’s chest.

Bang!

Zhi Yan slammed against the wall again, but Yang Ye didn’t give him another chance. Yang Ye stomped his right foot down and relied on the counterforce to slam himself against Zhi Yan Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Boom!

Zhi Yan slammed against the wall once more.

Because of the golden bowl from before, the temple remained completely unharmed, even if they were extremely strong. However, the battle was still going on. Now, Yang Ye wasn’t just using his sword, he was using his fist and entire body as well.

So long as it was a battle in close quarters, his entire body was a weapon!

A long time passed…

Bang!

A muffled explosion resounded, and then the temple fell silent.

Yang Ye was standing, and Zhi Yan was lying on the ground.

Yang Ye didn’t kill Zhi Yan, so he was still alive. However, Yang Ye had damaged Zhi Yan’s entire body.

Yang Ye glanced at Zhi Yan’s bloody figure and walked out of the temple. There was a middle aged monk outside the temple, and it was the same monk who’d led Yang Ye here a day ago.

The middle aged man pressed his palms together and bowed slightly to Yang Ye, “Thank you for showing mercy!”

He couldn’t stop Yang Ye from killing in a fair fight.

It was a rule, a rule between the four paths!

Yang Ye nodded slightly, “So, can I leave?”

The middle aged monk replied, “I’m afraid you can’t!”

Yang Ye smiled, “Are you sure that you want me to stay?”

The monk replied, “Master Yang, there’s some enmity between you and my Buddhist Path. It has to be resolved before you leave. Don’t you think so too?”

Yang Ye replied, “Indeed. So, how does the Buddhist Path intend to deal with it?”

The monk fell silent for a short while and replied, “I heard you killed a Sage in the Weapon Dimension. A Sage of my Buddhist Path refuses to believe that, so he wishes to see it for himself. I wonder if you’re willing?”

A Sage!

The Buddhist Path wanted him to face a Sage too.

Using a Sage represented that they didn’t just want a spar, they wanted to kill him.

They wanted his life!

Yang Ye shook his head and smiled when he realized this. Sure enough, his trip to the Buddhist Path wasn’t that smooth.

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts and gazed at the monk, “Of course I’m willing. However, I’m only accepting a fight where life and death is decided. It won’t end until one of us dies!

Until one of them dies!
