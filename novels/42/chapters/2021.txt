Chapter 2022 – My Sword is Supreme!

Attack together!

All of them had quite weird expressions on their faces because they thought Yang Ye intended to fight it on his own.

“Attack!” Meanwhile, Mad Saber’s voice resounded, and then a ray of saber energy whistled through the air as it shot at the Crimson Ox.

Lin Tian and the others attacked as well.

Viciousness flashed through the Crimson Ox’s eyes, and it unfurled its right fist and swept it forward in an arc.

The space around it instantly warped and twisted!

At the same time, a wave of powerful force swept out from its palm and swept towards Yang Ye and the others like a tornado. As expected, Yang Ye and the others were instantly blasted away, and some were even blasted over 10km away!

Meanwhile, the Crimson Ox hadn’t stopped, and it slammed down its palms against the ground.

Bang!

The ground shook violently as a wave of powerful force shot up into the sky. Yang Ye and the others were the first to bear the brunt of it, and they were blasted backwards repeatedly while some even spat out mouthfuls of blood.

In just two collisions, Yang Ye and the others were completely defeated!

They were no match for it!

That was what Lin Tian and the others felt. The Crimson Ox was much stronger than they’d ever imagined.

Even Yang Ye had an extremely solemn expression on his face. Because the Crimson Ox’s physical strength and defense made him feel quite helpless. Even if he used his sword, it would probably be extremely difficult for him to cause any material harm.

Its defenses were truly too terrifying!

Meanwhile, the Crimson Ox stretched out a finger and gestured at them again!

It was provoking them!

It was blatantly provoking them!

Mad Saber spoke solemnly, “What do we do?”

Yang Ye spoke in a low voice, “Tell them all to stop holding back.” All of them in this group weren’t ordinary. So, besides the Crimson Ox’s strength, there was another reason why they’d been utterly defeated earlier, and it was that they hadn’t used their full strength!

They were holding back!

All of them were holding back, including Yang Ye!

Mad Saber nodded slightly, “Everyone, if you continue holding back, you can forget about the Sage’s inheritance. Use your full strength!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Mad Saber suddenly appeared in the sky. He held his saber tight while profound energy surged out into it, causing it to start trembling while dazzling rays of light flashed out incessantly from it.

All of the rays of light rained down like a storm upon the Crimson Ox, and every single one of them tore space open.

He was being serious!

Lin Tian and the others hesitated for a moment, and then they attacked as well. This time, they didn’t hold back anymore. Or to be more precise, even if they were, they weren’t holding back much.

The joint forces of a few dozen geniuses could kill a few Zen Realm experts in an instant!

At this moment, the Crimson Ox suddenly clenched its fists, and then a faint red light appeared on them. The faint red light hadn’t just appeared on its fists, even his eyes had a strange red glow.

Roar!

The Crimson Ox roared with fury at Yang Ye and the others, and then it slammed its fists forward.

Bang!

A loud explosion resounded, and then Mad Saber’s sword energy that was at the front of the attack was instantly obliterated. At the same time, Mad Saber was blasted away. Meanwhile, Lin Tian and the others were similarly blasted away before they could even react.

Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!

A few dozen figures slammed against the ground, and numerous holes were blasted open.

Yang Ye was the only one still standing.

After it blasted all of them away, the Crimson Ox didn’t launch another attack. It just stood on the spot while looking at Yang Ye’s standing figure, and then it gestures at Yang Ye with a finger again.

The corners of Yang Ye’s mouth curled up. He didn’t draw his sword and just stretched out his right hand slowly. After that, an ethereal white dragon claw appeared around his hand.

The Sky Dragon!

Once the white dragon claw appeared, Yang Ye shot towards the Crimson Ox. In an instant, he’d arrived in front of the Crimson Ox, and then he slammed his claw at it.

The Crimson Ox’s gaze descended upon the ethereal dragon claw, and then it frowned slightly.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye’s dragon claw had arrived before it. However, it didn’t dodge and just slammed its fist forward.

Bang!

This punch slammed straight against Yang Ye’s dragon claw. Both of them shook violently, and then Yang Ye was blasted 300m away. As for the Crimson Ox, it was blasted around 30m away, and there was a faint claw mark on its fist.

Everyone exchanged glances when they witnessed this, and there was shock in their eyes.

The Crimson Ox glanced at its own fist, and then gazed at Yang Ye. Or to be more precise, it gazed at the ethereal dragon claw on Yang Ye’s fist.

Yang Ye glanced at his fist. It had cracked open. The Crimson Ox’s strength truly surpassed him by too much.

So, it was utterly impossible for him to defeat it with his physical strength!

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts and intended to draw his sword. He could only truly fight it by drawing his sword.

However, it suddenly pointed at Yang Ye and pointed at the hill.

Yang Ye was stunned by this, and so was everyone else!

A short while passed before Yang Ye asked, “You want me to go there?”

The Crimson Ox nodded.

The expressions of everyone here became quite weird. Of course, some of them had quite gloomy expressions on their faces, and no one knew what they were thinking.

Yang Ye ignored the others and asked, “Why?”

The Crimson Ox frowned and pointed at the hill again.

Yang Ye wanted to say something, but Mad Saber suddenly walked over to his side and said, “Ignore all of that and just go first.”

Yang Ye asked, “What about all of you?”

Mad Saber laughed bitterly, “Forget us. Do you think we can go if that fellow refuses to let us?”

Yang Ye nodded, glanced at the Crimson Ox, and then walked over to the hill without saying another word.

The Crimson Ox moved aside and didn’t stop him!

Everyone watched as Yang Ye vanished on the hill.

All of them remained silent and no one knew what they were thinking. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Meanwhile, the Crimson Ox stared at them and remained on the spot.

A short while passed before Lin Tian suddenly said, “Everyone, I’m leaving first!”

He vanished on the spot once he finished speaking. Liao Dan, Su Xiu, and two others left with him.

Some of the others left in succession once Lin Tian left.

Only Mad Saber, his younger brother, and three more young men from the devil race remained here.

Ming Che spoke solemnly, “Those fellows…”

Mad Saber nodded slightly, “Ignore them. We just have to wait here!”

…

Yang Ye arrived at the top of the hill. There was a single small hut there, and it was very simple, or it could even be described as crude. It was built from weeds and branches. It wasn’t fit for human inhabitation at all!

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings, and it didn’t take long for a solemn expression to appear on his face.

There were numerous bottomless holes in the surroundings.

“Come in!” Suddenly, an aged voice came from within the hut.

Yang Ye looked in its direction and didn’t hesitate to walk over there. After that, he pushed its door open gently. There was an old man seated cross-legged within it. The old man had white hair, an aged appearance, and emanated faint white light.

The old man’s eyes were closed, and he didn’t open them.

Suddenly, the old man asked, “The Sky Dragon?”

I see! Yang Ye finally understood why the Crimson Ox allowed him to come here. It was because of the Sky Dragon he possessed. It was the guardian beast of the sky race in the past.

Yang Ye nodded.

The old man asked, “You’re human, so why do you have it?”

Yang Ye replied with a question, “Do you discriminate against humans?”

“Discriminate against humans?” The old man shook his head slightly, “Of course not. All things in the world are equal. Not to mention that there’s quite a deep link between the sky race and human race. I merely asked out of curiosity!”

Yang Ye stated, “It was given to me by another senior!”

“Then it should have been the Sky Emperor!” The old man continued, “He wanted you to become the sky race’s guardian, right?”

Yang Ye nodded and said, “I’m here to find out why you died here and stop the devil race from obtaining your inheritance.” He was urging the old man to give his inheritance to him!

The old man fell silent for a long time, and then he said, “You’re not suitable to inherit my mantle!”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Why?”

The old man answered, “You know why!”

Yang Ye shook his head, “Not really!”

The old man said, “There are many reasons. Firstly, your desire to kill is too strong. Secondly, you possess the Dao Path and Weapon Path’s aura. Even though my inheritance doesn’t conflict with them, the karma you carry is too great… In short, we’re not the same type of person.”

Yang Ye shrugged, “Fine! I won’t force it!”

The old man continued, “However, just as you’ve said, my inheritance can’t fall into the hands of the devil race. I’ll merge my inheritance into an Inheritance Seed. I hope you’ll take it back to Sky Dimension and help me find a suitable successor, alright?”

Yang Ye nodded, “Alright! So, how did you die here?”

The old man suddenly asked, “Are you a sword cultivator?”

Yang Ye nodded, “I am!”

The old man fell silent for a short while, and then he said, “I can’t let you leave empty handed, so I’ll give you a gift!”

The old man suddenly stretched out his right hand and waved it lightly before Yang Ye.

In an instant, the scene before Yang Ye changed. Or it should be said that a scene appeared before Yang Ye’s eyes.

Horizon Mountain.

There was a man walking slowly towards the mountain. He looked up when he arrived at its base, and a long time passed before he spoke softly, “Amongst the 3,000 Grand Daos of the world, my Sword Dao reigns supreme!”

Yang Ye fell silent.

The man before him was the Unfettered One!

The Unfettered One!
