Chapter 2693 – I’m Here to Beat You Up!

Countless strands of Heaven Executor’s sword energy converged within the tower.

They hadn’t dispersed along with the departure of their master, and they’d remained here in Martial Sky World.

They were ceaselessly devouring the spirit energy and quintessence of Martial Sky World instead. It could be said that perhaps Destiny had no intention to destroy Martial Sky World, but perhaps even she didn’t know that her own sword energy was causing such damage to this world.

Of course, she may not care even if she did realize.

How could someone who’d killed her way through that bloody era be someone benevolent?

The woman in white could be described as a very, very unusual existence!

Yang Ye frowned when he sensed Heaven Executor’s sword energy fighting back.

They weren’t weak at all!

They remained in this world and were ceaselessly absorbing the spirit energy and quintessence of this world. It could be said that they weren’t just sword energy anymore!

They were sword energy that had their own consciousness!

If they wanted, they could condense into a sword at any time, and even form a real Sword Sprite. However, they didn’t do that. Obviously, they were waiting for something.

Yang Ye didn’t dare act carelessly when he noticed their counterattack. Past Life shot forward from his waist, and then he activated his Past Life Energy. A short while later, countless strands of Past Life Sword Energy that carried Past Life Energy appeared here.

They were in confrontation!

“Stop!” The ethereal man spoke abruptly, “Please stop!”

Yang Ye frowned slightly, but he did stop. However, once he stopped, the sword energy didn’t stop and were still attacking him!

Yang Ye was about to attack when Snowy withdrew her Sprite Staff, and then a strand of mysterious energy appeared here!

The Sprite Domain!

Yang Ye watched with astonishment as Snowy waved her Sprite Staff, and then Heaven Executor’s sword energy was enveloped by countless strands of spirit energy. A moment later, the spirit energy started to devour them!

What did sword energy rely on to exist? It was spirit energy, of course.

Once sword energy left the sword and lost the support of their master’s profound energy, they could only rely on absorbing the spirit energy of the world to survive.

Yet now, Snowy was the master of spirit energy.

It didn’t take long for the sword energy to retreat like a receding tide and didn’t dare to get close to Snowy at all!

Snowy was stunned when she saw them retreat! She hadn’t had enough fun!

After all, she’d finally had a chance to show off, but they’d actually ran away?

She was very angry!

Snowy waved the Sprite Staff, and then countless strands of spirit energy converged into the Primal True Dragon’s form before chasing after the sword energy.

Suddenly, the ethereal man’s voice resounded, “Please stop!”

Snowy gazed at Yang Ye. The latter hesitated for a moment and nodded for Snowy to stop. Snowy unwillingly deactivated the Sprite Domain, and then she glanced at the middle aged man with slight displeasure in her eyes. After that, she waved her paw, and the sword in the man’s grasp flew over to her.

The middle aged man was stunned speechless.

Snowy glanced at the sword, and then she took it into the Primordial Pagoda.

Yang Ye gazed at the man, and the latter spoke solemnly, “We can’t be rash. The energy of Heaven Executor contained within those strands of sword energy is very powerful. Moreover, their energy is very special. If they risk it all and go all out, this tower will be obliterated, and the remnants of my people will be affected by that.”

The remnants of his people!

Yang Ye glanced at the ethereal man. Sure enough, the Martial Sky Clan wasn’t completely annihilated. But it did make sense because unless someone intentionally tried to annihilate them, it was very difficult to truly annihilate a clan. There would at least be a few that survived.

It was like that for the Past Life Clan, and it was the same for the Martial Sky Clan!

Yang Ye presumed that it would be the same for the other clans too. However, they would have concealed their identities and remained hidden.

After all, their enemy was Destiny!

Yang Ye thought for a moment and said, “Then what do you think should be done?”

The man fell silent for a short while and said, “Seal them. Ask the Good Sprite to seal the sword energy so that they can’t continue destroying this world!”

Yang Ye asked, “What if they decide to resist until the end?”

The man fell silent.

If they were driven into a corner, the sword energy would definitely resist until the end. Based on the situation from just now, their desire to live was very strong!

Meanwhile, the man gazed at Yang Ye, “Can you use Past Life to absorb them?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “They aren’t the same.”

Yang Ye had tried earlier, but the sword energy completely ignored Past Life, and they even tried to assault Past Life instead.

They were completely different swords!

If Heaven Executor was still in his possession, then perhaps he could try!

Yang Ye thought for a moment and replied, “How about I ask Snowy to isolate them, and then restore the spirit energy here.”

The man spoke solemnly, “But once the spirit energy here is restored, they will come here to absorb it.”

Yang Ye felt quite speechless, “It’s the best I can do. Otherwise, leave this place and allow me to obliterate the sword energy in this world.”Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

The man shook his head.

Yang Ye shrugged to display that he couldn’t do anything. Even though the sword energy was formidable, he could destroy them. However, it wasn’t that easy to accomplish. After all, they’d practically mutated now.

Coupled with the fact that their original master is absolutely formidable, and that they’d ceaselessly absorbed the spirit energy and quintessence of this world, they were actually not just sword energy anymore!

They could be considered as a type of living being!

Actually, Yang Ye felt that they were able to survive because the experts of the Martial Sky Clan had been slaughtered. Otherwise, based on their past strength, while dealing with Destiny may be impossible, but dealing with the sword energy here would have been absolutely easy!

The man glanced at Yang Ye and said, “Come with me!”

Yang Ye followed the man inside, and a short while later, he suddenly waved his finger toward the empty ground before him.

The ground split apart toward the sides, and then a stone stairway that led underground appeared before them.

The man led Yang Ye to an underground city, and Yang Ye sensed spirit energy here!

It wasn’t very dense, but it was countless times better than it was up above!

During this time, Yang Ye saw some people. They were almost the same as humans, and they were looking at him with curiosity in their eyes.

The man led Yang Ye to a huge black cauldron, and within it were four swords!

Ocean blue, earthen yellow, blood red, and pure green!

The man gazed at the swords for a long time, and then he waved his right hand. The swords flew out of the black cauldron and went over to Yang Ye.

The man turned to face Yang Ye and said, “While the sword energy hasn’t been dealt with, you can still have these swords.”

Yang Ye was quite puzzled, “Why?”

The man replied, “Consider it as goodwill.”

Goodwill!

Yang Ye glanced at the man and accepted the swords. Meanwhile, Snowy appeared.

She gazed at the four swords and seemed very curious. She started looking at and touching them, and then she merged the five swords into one.

Hiss!

In an instant, the space throughout the underground world cracked open. At the same time, Yang Ye sensed an invisible force obliterating everything here!

The man’s expression changed drastically, “Stop!”

Snowy had clearly noticed that something was off, so she hurriedly split them again!

Once they were split, the surroundings returned to normal.

The man heaved a sigh of relief!

Snowy blinked, and then she sneaked off behind Yang Ye.

Yang Ye glared at her, and then he gazed at the man, “What was that?”

The man took a deep breath and explained, “It is no ordinary sword. The Five Element Sword contains the purest energy of the five elements. If they are converged into one, they will draw upon the energy of the five elements in the world. This energy of the five elements is no different than the quintessence energy of the Three Dimensional Universe. Our ancestors had planned to use the quintessence energy of the Three Dimensional Universe to fight against the Heaven Dao and Destiny all those years ago. Unfortunately, they failed!”

At this point, the man seemed to have thought of something, and he shook his head and sighed, “If that second ancestor of mine hadn’t been conceited to the point of challenging Destiny and trying to destroy her with these five swords, my Martial Sky Clan wouldn’t have fallen into this state.”

Yang Ye fell silent.

Obviously, their previous patriarch had wanted to enter the Four Dimensional Space, but the outcome was tragic.

Meanwhile, the man glanced at Snowy and spoke softly, “Under normal circumstances, it would be impossible for an ordinary person to merge those swords, but she…”

Yang Ye smiled wryly, “She’s an exception.”

Snowy!

Not to mention the Five Element Sword, she could even merge Destiny’s swords.

The man smiled wryly as well, “She is.”

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and asked, “About the Martial Sky Invulnerable Body…”

His expression suddenly changed at this point.

The ethereal man frowned as well, “Is it a friend of yours?”

Yang Ye shook his head, and the man’s face became vigilant.

Yang Ye said, “He should be here for me! I’ll go deal with it!”

Yang Ye left the underground city and returned to the surface. He saw a long-haired middle aged man far away in space.

The man seemed quite familiar!

It didn’t take long for Yang Ye to recall who it was.

First God!

The man who’d been nailed to a cliff by the master of Heaven Executor!

How did he get down from there?

Yang Ye frowned slightly.

Meanwhile, First God appeared before Yang Ye. He sized up Yang Ye and said, “Three things. Firstly, they want me to kill you and take your Sprite Progenitor. Will you take your own life, or should I do it for you? If you do, you should be able to die an easier death.”

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly. He was about to speak when something unexpected happened here.

The sword energy of Heaven Executor surged over from all directions. They seemed to have gone insane.

Yang Ye looked up, and a woman in a gray robe was arriving on a sword.

It was Heaven Executor beneath her feet!

There was a wine gourd by her waist, and short hair on her head…

Yang Ye’s eyelids twitched when he saw her.

Dammit! It’s her again!

It was the woman who’d bashed him up without even giving him a reason!

Tu!

Tu gazed at Yang Ye and said, “I’m here to beat you up!”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

Suddenly, Tu looked at First God and frowned slightly, “Why do you look so familiar?”
