Chapter 269 – Profounder Continent?

After accompanying Little Yao and Bao’er for a few days, Yang Ye started to gather the spirit herbs that Elder Mu asked him to gather. With Lin Shan’s help, he’d gathered all the materials without encountering any difficulty. After he finished gathering the spirit herbs and medicinal herbs, Yang Ye bid his farewells to Lin Shan and headed below Death Abyss.

Even though Yang Ye had won in the battle with Yuan Tong, it allowed him to realize his insufficiencies. After all, if he hadn’t utilized the tiny vortex and the Dao Artifact, and if he had merely relied on his own combat instinct and sword techniques, then the outcome of the battle was unpredictable!

Moreover, according to the Founding Emperor, the youths from the Devil Race that he would encounter at the Ancient Battlefield were much more monstrous geniuses than Yuan Tong. So, he had to improve his strength as soon as possible. Especially his physical body!

If he hadn’t relied on his extremely formidable physical body during the battle with Yuan Tong, then he would absolutely not dare to fight Yuan Tong in close quartered combat. Because Yuan Tong’s combat instinct was truly terrifying. Especially when Yuan Tong had comprehended both Battle Intent and Fist Intent! Under such circumstances, an ordinary physical body would be utterly unable to endure a single punch from Yuan Tong.

In short, he had numerous insufficiencies. So, he’d headed to the Death Abyss to look for Elder Mu again. Even though he didn’t know what this mysterious old man wanted him to do in the future, Elder Mu was the only one who could help him now. So, he had no other choice!

Outside Elder Mu’s cottage, Elder Mu supported himself with the walking stick. He gazed at Yang Ye and grinned before he said, “You obtained the 1st position on the Ascension Rankings?”

“It was only luck!” Yang Ye nodded, and then he described the battle between him and Yuan Tong.

After a short while, Elder Mu nodded lightly and said, “You really were lucky. Even though Yuan Tong was said to be the Quasi Martial Emperor, he hadn’t comprehended the Heart of the Strong. If he’d comprehended it, then you would probably be unable to defeat him even if you utilized that Dao Artifact. Haha.... The Martial God. After such an existence that could become the Martial God finally appeared in the southern territory, he was destroyed at your hands!”

Yang Ye shook his head and didn’t say anything. No matter if it was the Martial God or the Sword Emperor, he wasn’t interested at all. Since the very beginning, he only had a single objective, and that was to rescue his mother from the Flower Palace!

Elder Mu suddenly asked. “If I’m not wrong, then you’re probably heading to the Ancient Battlefield next?”

Yang Ye was stunned, and then he said, “How did you know, Elder Mu?”

Elder Mu smiled lightly, and then he revealed a serious expression and said, “The Ancient Battlefield is said to be the grave of geniuses. No matter how much of a genius one was, it’s possible to be buried there. Because there’s never a lack of monstrous geniuses there. At that place, there’s no one that’s the most monstrous genius because there’s always an even more monstrous genius. Right, even if you’ve attained the Enlightened Sword Heart and initial-stage of Sword Intent, you can only be considered as average there!”

“The members of the Devil Race are really so terrifying?” asked Yang Ye with a low voice.

Elder Mu shook his head, and then he raised his head to look up into the sky as he said slowly, “Looks like you don’t have a good understanding of the Ancient Battlefield. The reason it’s called the Ancient Battlefield isn’t merely because it’s the battlefield of the humans and Darkbeasts against the Devil Race.”

When he spoke up to here, Elder Mu suddenly turned to look at Yang Ye before he said, “Do you know how large this continent is?”

Yang Ye was stunned, and then he shook his head. What a joke? How could he possibly know how large the continent was? The furthest he’d been was only the Grand Myriad Mountains!

Elder Mu spoke slowly. “During the ancient times, this continent was called Profounder Continent. One day, a precious treasure suddenly appeared on Profounder Continent, and this treasure was called the Boundless Sea of Energy. For the sake of seizing this precious treasure, two top experts of Profounder Continent engaged each other in battle. Both of them were the supreme experts of that time, and any one of them could shatter a star with a single strike of the palm. After a hundred years of fighting, their battle had caused Profounder Continent to shatter apart into nine territories!”

They shattered an entire continent. Such strength.... Yang Ye suppressed the shock in his heart, and then he asked. “Elder Mu, what you mean is that our southern territory is one of those nine territories?”

Elder Mu nodded and said, “The extreme north that is the other side of the Heaven Tower Mountain Range is actually another territory, and it’s called the Devil Territory!”

“Since it used to be a single continent, then why has no one from the other territories come to the southern territory?” asked Yang Ye.

Elder Mu sighed and said, “Because every single territory was sealed off by the supreme strength of an expert. For example, the reason the Heaven Tower Mountain Range is able to obstruct the Devil Race isn’t that it’s impossible to scale, and it’s instead because that expert’s seal resides there!”

“Then why are the youths of the Devil Race able to climb over the mountain range and arrive at the southern territory?” asked Yang Ye.

Elder Mu chuckled and said, “There are always people of exceptional ability emerging throughout the generations. Even though he was extremely formidable, that expert has perished in the end. On the other hand, even though the strength of the Devil Race’s Devil Exalt is inferior to that expert, the gap between them isn’t huge. So, he has been weakening the seal on Heaven Tower Mountain Range, and that’s why countless youths from the Devil Race can come to the southern territory from the Devil Territory!”

“What Elder Mu means that it isn’t just the Devil Region, and the seal on the various other regions sealed by that experts has started to weaken as well? In other words, it wouldn’t just be the youths from the Devil Race that will be making an appearance at the Ancient Battlefield, and the extraordinary geniuses of the other territories will be there as well?” asked Yang Ye in a low voice.

A wisp of praise flashed in Elder Mu’s eyes, and then he nodded lightly.

Yang Ye’s heart sank when he heard this because the Founding Emperor hadn’t told him that the experts of the other territories would be appearing at the Ancient Battlefield. Did he do it unintentionally or intentionally? If it was intentional, then what was his intention?

Elder Mu suddenly said, “Actually, I don’t approve of you going to the Ancient Battlefield! Because you’re merely at the First Heaven Realm now, so your cultivation is too low. It’s unrealistic for you to think of surmounting realms of cultivation to do battle there. After all, those who’re able to appear on the Ancient Battlefield are monstrous geniuses amongst monstrous geniuses! Even though you’re a monstrous genius as well, as I’ve said before, your cultivation is a bit too low!”

When he spoke up to here, Elder Mu suddenly changed the topic and said, “However, that place is an opportunity for you to become stronger as well. Because fighting the experts from the other territories is very beneficial to you. Moreover, there’s a treasure there that you must obtain in order to temper your body into a state that’s stronger than the physical bodies of Darkbeasts and the Devil Race!”

“What treasure?” asked Yang Ye.

Elder Mu smiled, and then he opened his right hand. A flame instantly appeared on his palm, and then he said, “There are some precious treasures in the world, and these precious treasures form a ‘spirit’ of their own after experiencing the baptism of countless years. Just like this Nether Ghostflames of mine. Even though it seemed like a mere strand of flames, it actually has its own intelligence.”

When he spoke up to here, Elder Mu flicked his finger, and the ghastly white colored Nether Ghostflames suddenly attached itself onto Yang Ye’s Hidden Sword.

Yang Ye was stunned when he saw the Hidden Sword being completely enveloped by the Nether Ghostflames. He didn’t know what Elder Mu was trying to show him, so he raised his head to look at Elder Mu.

Elder Mu grinned and said, “Try waving your sword now!”

When he heard this, Yang Ye hesitated briefly before he drew his sword and slashed. In an instant, a strand of sword qi shot out explosively from the Hidden Sword. However, it was unlike the past, because the Nether Ghostflames was actually attached to the sword qi. In other words, this strand of sword qi Yang Ye executed was one that carried fire.... This was extremely shocking!

Bang!

An enormous tree over 30m away was instantly blasted apart by that strand of sword qi. However, the following scene stunned Yang Ye on the spot. Because the tree that exploded apart had actually mysteriously transformed into nothingness as if it had never existed there!

When has my sword qi become so formidable? Even 4th level Sword Intent is unable to accomplish that! Yang Ye was stunned, and then he gazed at Elder Mu and said, “It’s because of the Nether Ghostflames?”

Elder Mu nodded and said, “The Nether Ghostflames hasn’t been subdued by you, so it’s true might is far from just that. If you subdue it, then not only will it temper your body all day and night, you can even utilize it just like how I attached it to your sword qi just now. Moreover, not only can it be attached to your sword qi, it can even be attached to your sword. So, if your opponent’s Dark Treasure isn’t of sufficient quality, then it would probably be incinerated into nothingness by the Nether Ghostflames before it can even approach your sword!” Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Yang Ye gulped down a mouthful of saliva, and then he said, “Elder Mu, you mean that you intend to give the Nether Ghostflames to me?”

Elder Mu nodded!

Yang Ye took a deep breath, and then he suppressed the excitement in his heart and said with a puzzled tone, “Why?”

There was no free food in the world. Moreover, Elder Mu and Yang Ye were neither related nor friends. Even though they were like master and disciple by way of the guidance Elder Mu had provided him, they weren’t actual master and disciple. So, why would Elder Mu give him such a precious treasure of the heavens and the earth? Yang Ye didn’t possess such great charism to warrant this....

Elder Mu glanced at Yang Ye before he sighed lightly, and then he said, “Your current strength is too weak, and I don’t have much time left. So, you have to improve your strength as quickly as possible. Otherwise, you’ll be utterly unable to accomplish what I want you to do!”

“You don’t have much time?” Yang Ye frowned and said, “Elder Mu, what do you mean?”

Elder Mu shook his head and said, “You’ll find out about all of that in the future. In short, you must improve your strength as quickly as possible. Not only for the sake of your mother but for your own sake as well. Because the southern territory is about to fall into disorder! Don’t ask me what I mean. You’ll naturally understand when the time comes.”

Yang Ye shook his head helplessly when he heard this. Is Elder Mu trying to arouse my curiosity on purpose? With his strength, can anyone even harm him? Moreover, what did he mean when he said the southern territory is about to fall into disorder?

Yang Ye shook his head, stopped thinking about it, and then he asked. “Elder Mu, you said there’s a treasure I need in the Ancient Battlefield. What is it? How should I search for it?”

After he witnessed the terrifying might of the Nether Ghostflames, Yang Ye grew even more curious towards that treasure that Elder Mu had spoken about.

“Don’t be impatient!” Elder Mu smiled, and then he walked slowly towards the bath barrel. After that, he flipped his palm, and the Nether Ghostflames instantly entered the bath barrel. In an instant, the water within the barrel started burning. At the same time, the temperature in the surroundings instantly rose, and it was to the point that Yang Ye was able to clearly sense the terrifying temperature within the bath barrel even if he was over 10m away from it!

Elder Mu turned to look at Yang Ye before he said, “Go on in!”

Yang Ye’s expression instantly became unsightly when he heard this....
