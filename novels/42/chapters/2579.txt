Chapter 2580

Bam!

Yang Ye was pushed backward repeatedly!

He was pushed around 300m back!

Yang Ye stopped himself, glanced at his right hand, and it had cracked open and was bleeding!

Yang Ye shook his head and laughed with self-ridicule. Now that he didn’t have Executor, his strength had dropped by quite a few levels!

If he had Executor, he would have definitely not been at a disadvantage just now, or it should be said that he would have destroyed the man’s saber! Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

The man sized up Yang Ye and said, “A sword cultivator?”

Yang Ye nodded slightly.

The young man cracked a smile, “Draw your sword and let’s have a good fight!”

A sword?

Yang Ye shook his head and chuckled, “I don’t have one!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he tapped his foot against the ground and transformed into a ray of light that shot forward.

The young man grinned, and then he swung his saber with his right hand.

Hiss!

As soon as it descended, it shattered the ray of light that Yang Ye had transformed into. At the same time, a pair of hands clamped down onto the saber!

They were Yang Ye’s hands!

At the instant he grabbed the man’s saber, Yang Ye’s hands slid down while he slammed his body against the young man!

Bang!

The man was blasted over 100m away.

As soon as he stopped himself, Yang Ye was in front of him again. Meanwhile, the man used both hands to swing his saber horizontally at Yang Ye.

Hiss!

A ray of dazzling saber energy rippled out in the form of a crescent.

Now that he didn’t have Executor, Yang Ye didn’t dare to go head-on against this attack. So, he immediately moved around 30m back and avoided the attack!

At this moment, Yang Ye noticed that after he lost Executor, he couldn’t go head-on against his enemies as he’d done before!

When he had Executor, his sword could fight any divine treasure, even Super Divine Treasures. Yet now, he had to learn how to dodge and not go head-on against everything. Otherwise, he would definitely die!

He felt tied down!

It was the first time Yang Ye had felt this way!

The man glanced at Yang Ye and said, “Will you still not draw your sword?”

Yang Ye thought for a moment, stretched out his hand, and made a grasping motion. A sword condensed from sword intent appeared in his grasp.

The man’s face instantly turned icy cold as he felt Yang Ye was looking down on him!

The man stomped his right foot down and shot forward.

A ray of saber energy flashed through the bridge!

Yang Ye just stood there, and when it arrived around 1m away from him, his figure instantly turned ethereal, and then his sword shot forward.

The Sword Domain!

However, he’d forgotten that he wasn’t holding Executor anymore.

So, when he swung his sword for the 6th time, the sword in his grasp exploded apart. Combined with the powerful saber energy that was assaulting him, he was instantly blasted away.

Bang!

Once his feet slammed back against the ground, he was pushed around 50m more before he could finally stop himself.

There was an extremely deep injury on his chest.

It was very, very deep!

It should be said that it had pierced through his body!

The Lord Realm!

The young man was only at the Lord Realm, but now that he didn’t have a sword, he noticed that he couldn’t even fight a Lord Realm expert! Even though the young man was no ordinary Lord Realm expert, so what?

Yes, if he had a sword, the Sword Gourd, and his flying swords, he could utterly suppress the young man!

But he had none of those now, so he was being suppressed instead!

Yang Ye suddenly started laughing, but his laughing was filled with sadness and self-ridicule!

Because at this moment, he’d noticed that his strength wasn’t true!

It wasn’t!

All of it couldn’t really be considered as belonging to him!

Besides that, he didn’t have an endless supply of Primordial Violet Energy anymore!

Because the Primordial Pagoda was sealed. So, once he used the Primordial Violet Energy within him, he would have no more. He had to absorb spirit energy and convert them again. Simply speaking, he didn’t have that abnormal recovery that he usually possessed!

Now, he would die if he risked his life in battle!

Everything he could rely on was gone!

Now, he only had his body, his sword intent, and Sword Domain!

Yang Ye ignored the injury on his chest and glanced at his hand. He realized that he himself was the only truly real thing, and everything else like divine treasures, secret techniques, external sources of strength, and everything else wasn’t truly real!

It wasn’t at all!

His sword hadn’t been truly real in the past.

The Unfettered One’s sword was pure, Qi Bitian’s technique, Sky Claw, was pure as well. They were strong because they were completely pure and true!

Yang Ye looked down at his sword condensed from sword intent, shook his head and smiled. This sword was his truest sword.

As soon as he thought of that, the intent sword in his grasp trembled, and then countless strands of intent converged. More and more sword intent converged to it, and the sword grew more and more material as time passed! In the end, it wasn’t an ethereal sword made of sword intent any longer.

It was a real sword!

It was in the shape of the Sword Precursor!

The young man witnessed this scene, and there was a trace of bewilderment in his eyes, “What the heck are you doing?”

Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly shot forward, and a ray of sword energy slashed at the young man!

The young man’s eyes narrowed slightly. He didn’t retreat and advanced instead. He took a stride forward and swung the broken saber with both hands.

Hiss!

It seemed like it could slash open the world, and it was extremely shocking!

The saber stressed upon an imposing aura. The stronger it was, the stronger the saber would be. The man’s saber had an imposing aura that slightly surpassed Yang Ye’s expectations. Because it wasn’t at a level that a Lord Realm expert should possess!

But Yang Ye didn’t care, and his sword didn’t slow down at all!

Just like that, saber and sword collided in the most direct and violent manner!

Bang!

Countless rays of saber energy and sword energy erupted from the collision. Both of them were blasted away, but Yang Ye’s sword suddenly shot forward!

A flying sword!

Its speed and strength couldn’t compete with those two divine treasures in the Sword Gourd!

The man casually swung his saber and blasted Yang Ye’s intent sword away!

Yang Ye descended to the ground and stretched out his hand. The intent sword returned to his grasp once more.

Yang Ye looked up at the man, and then a mysterious wave of energy appeared in the surroundings.

The Sword Domain!

The man’s expression changed slightly when he noticed the Sword Domain, but it only took a moment for his saber to tremble, and then he swung it in all directions!

Bang!

The entire Sword Domain shook, and Yang Ye’s countenance instantly turned pale!

But that was all!

The Sword Domain had been strengthened with Qi Bitian’s help, so Lord Realm experts couldn’t destroy it with ease!

The man was about to launch another attack, but Yang Ye had attacked.

A sword suddenly appeared before the young man!

It had appeared so abruptly, and there had been no signs of its approach!

However, the man relied on his outstanding combat instinct to twist his body sideways while swinging his saber at an angle.

Clang!

Along with a loud clang, the sword vanished, but it didn’t take long for a dense expanse of sword energy to appear around the young man!

Actually, there was only a single ray of sword energy, but due to how fast it was, it seemed like there were so many!

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!

In the Sword Domain, the sound of something being sliced apart resounded incessantly!

“Break!” Meanwhile, the young man shouted with fury, and then a terrifying wave of saber energy erupted within the Sword Domain, and the sword energy in the surroundings were obliterated!

The entire Sword Domain shattered!

Suddenly, Yang Ye appeared before the young man, and then he swung the intent sword like a madman!

Swing after swing!

The Madness Sword Technique!

At this moment, Yang Ye disregarded his life again!

In the Sword Domain, Yang Ye would be invincible if the young man couldn’t destroy the Sword Domain. Because Yang Ye’s consciousness would be forcefully brought to a higher level within the Sword Domain. After all, every single move the man made within the Sword Domain couldn’t escape Yang Ye’s notice!

The Sword Domain belonged to Yang Ye, so it wasn’t an external source of strength. Thus, Qi Bitian hadn’t robbed him of this ability!

However, so long as it didn’t belong to him, she’d taken all of them!

On the bridge, explosions resounded incessantly, and every one of them caused the young man to be pushed around 100m back. As time passed, the young man was constantly pushed back, and he’d been pushed very far back!

Finally, Yang Ye stopped.

It was because a bearded old man had appeared before him.

Once the old man appeared, Yang Ye’s Sword Domain vanished.

It hadn’t been destroyed, Yang Ye had deactivated it himself.

The old man wasn’t at the Lord Realm!

At this moment, the young man was lying on the ground behind the old man. His entire body was covered in injuries from the sword, and it wasn’t exaggerated to be said that he’d been cut a thousand times!

Yang Ye wasn’t in a comparatively better state. His countenance was pale, and there was an injury on his waist. Blood was flowing out incessantly from there.

That wasn’t even the main point. The main point was that he didn’t have a drop of profound energy left within him.

Unlike before when he had the Primordial Pagoda and an endless supply of Primordial Violet Energy, his energy was limited now!

The old man glanced at Yang Ye and asked, “You came here on your own?”

Yang Ye wiped off the blood on the corner of his mouth and shook his head.

The old man glanced at the surroundings and said, “You’ve won.”

Once he finished speaking, he turned around, picked up the young man, and walked off into the distance.

“I want to continue…” The young man’s voice came from afar.

Yang Ye cracked a smile, “Continue? I can’t kill you!”

Yang Ye laid down on the ground and gasped for air.

A sword condensed from sword intent floated not too far away from him.

Yang Ye laid there on the ground, and he didn’t feel like moving a muscle.

His eyes closed slowly as a strange feeling arose in his heart.
