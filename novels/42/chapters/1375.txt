Chapter 1376 – Let Me See Who Can Stop Me!

He’s challenging the Nether Pavilion! Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly. Since he dared to challenge the Nether Pavilion, he was either a fool or extremely strong. Moreover, based on Nether Maiden’s expression, Yang Ye knew that he was definitely no fool.

Moreover, how could someone ranked at the 3rd position on the Martial Rankings be a fool?

The Martial Rankings!

The Martial Rankings wasn’t the Dragon Rankings, but it was very authoritative. Regardless of whether it was the Saber Monarch, Ye Lingfeng, or Ye Langxie, both of their strengths were really not bad. Of course, he wasn’t judging their former strength based on his current strength. After all, even then, he didn’t dare guarantee that he could defeat them!

Moreover, that fellow was at the 26th position on the Dragon Rankings!

The 26th!

Even though it was just the 26th, the Dragon Rankings wasn’t the Martial Rankings. The Dragon Rankings included the geniuses of the younger generation from the entire universe. So, even the word terrifying wasn’t enough to describe his ability to be ranked in the top 26 amongst billions.

Nether Maiden didn’t attack because someone else had gone up there.

It was the woman who rode a pig.

Yang Ye gazed at Nether Maiden and asked, “Someone intends to crush all of you?”

Nether Maiden remained silent.

Yang Ye walked over to her and looked her in the eyes, “If I’m not wrong, you refused to tell me and asked me to leave as soon as possible because you don’t want me to interfere in this, right?”

Nether Maiden gazed at him for a short while and said, “What we’re about to face is beyond your imagination, and it isn’t something you can interfere in. Understand?”

“That’s quite hurtful!” Yang Ye continued, “I think that my current strength is really not bad.”

She shook her head and said, “You know nothing about this matter. Listen to me and take your forces out of the Radiant Dimension. Based on your natural talent, becoming a peerless expert in the future is an absolutely simple thing.”

Yang Ye gazed at Nether Maiden for a long time and said, “Nether Maiden, remember how you said nothing before coming to help me when I was in trouble. I think that’s friendship. Now, you’ve encountered trouble, yet you want me to leave. Tell me, do you think I would leave? Do you?”

He’d met many of the Nether Pavilion’s hall masters, but he still had no idea of its strength and had never asked about it. It was still such a mysterious power to him. However, he’d still chosen to stand on the Nether Pavilion’s side. It was none other than because Nether Maiden was in it, and so was Blind Maiden. Moreover, the Nether Pavilion had helped him in the past.

In the end, he, Yang Ye, was a person who would never forget those who wronged him, and he would similarly not forget those who’d helped him.

He avenged enmity and repaid kindness!

Nether Maiden gazed at him and said, “It’s the experts of the large world that are targeting us. Understand?”

The large world! Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly. He naturally knew about it. After all, Mo Xiaoleng was from there. Besides that, Jian Wuji had been there as well. But even Jian Wuji could only be considered as ordinary in the large world, so he could imagine how terrifying it was. Yang Ye hadn’t expected that it was the large world’s experts that were targeting the Nether Pavilion.

Meanwhile, Nether Maiden added, “Moreover, it’s my Nether Pavilion’s business, so let us deal with it ourselves. You....”

Yang Ye shook his head and interrupted Nether Maiden, “Nether Maiden, I know you have good intentions and are thinking of my best interest. However, you know my temper well. So, don’t say things like that. Alright?”

She gazed at him for a long time and said, “You’ll change your mind because it exceeds your ability.”

“Perhaps!” Yang Ye chuckled, “Why are they attacking?”

“You’ll know very soon.” As soon as she finished speaking, she turned around and vanished on the spot.

Yang Ye fell silent. Obviously, Nether Maiden was definitely in trouble. Based on Nether Maiden’s expression and attitude, it was definitely not a small problem!

Yang Ye looked up at the sky. At this moment, the pig-riding young woman was in battle with Ye Xunhuan. Yang Ye shook his head after watching for a few breaths of time.

“AH!!” A shrill cry suddenly resounded in the sky, and then a figure shot off into the depths of outer space. In the blink of an eye, that figure had vanished from his vision.

He’d fled!

Ye Xunhuan had fled!

The pig-riding young woman looked up into the sky while holding her iron hammer in her grasp, and there was a wisp of disdain on the corners of her mouth. After that, her figure flashed and vanished from the sky.

Yang Ye fell silent for a while, and then he returned to the hall.

Xiao Bieli asked, “What’s going on?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “I don’t know the exact details. But the Nether Pavilion might be in trouble,”

He gazed at Xiao Bieli and continued, “All of you and the others from Pine Prefecture must leave as soon as possible. Dean Xiao, please head over to get them with Aunty Xiao.”

He would have nothing to worry about once all of them had left the Radiant Dimension. Otherwise, his hands would be tied. Actually, he regretted not bringing the Void Cloud Shuttle into the Radiant Dimension. If it were here, then gathering everyone would be much faster. Unfortunately, it was being used by Lin Qian and the others.

Xiao Bieli nodded, and then he immediately vanished with Xiao Ling.

Once they left, Yang Ye gazed at Su Shihe and said, “Elder Su, get everyone prepared. We’re leaving immediately.”

Su Shihe nodded and said, “Some aren’t willing to leave....”

Yang Ye fell silent for a moment and replied, “Bring those who are willing to leave. Those who aren’t willing can do as they please.”

“Understood!” Su Shihe nodded and left.

It didn’t take long for the students and elders here to leave, and only Yang Ye and Xiao Yuxi remained.

Xiao Yuxi asked, “You’ll help the Nether Pavilion, right?”

Yang Ye replied, “Actually, they may not even need my help.”

The hall masters of the Nether Pavilion were extremely strong, and they had Blind Maiden too. Blind Maiden was extremely strong and terrifying. Just as Nether Maiden had said, if even they couldn’t deal with it, then his presence wouldn’t make a difference.

However, he’d still decided to stay and see what happens.

If it wasn’t for the Nether Pavilion’s help, Lu Wan’er, Yu Wushuang, Xiao Yuxi, and all the others in the Radiant Dimension would have probably vanished before he could return.

Now that it was in trouble, he naturally intended to lend a hand.

Xiao Yuxi took Yang Ye’s hand and spoke softly, “Be careful!” She knew what sort of power the Nether Pavilion was, so trouble that it faced would absolutely not be minor.

Yang Ye nodded, and then he pulled her into the 3rd level of the Primordial Pagoda.

Xiao Yuxi gazed at Yang Ye and was puzzled, “What is this place?”

Yang Ye replied, “Cultivate here when you want to.”

The 3rd level of the Primordial Pagoda was a heaven defying cultivation room, and it absolutely allowed one to gain tremendous results in a short period. Of course, he wouldn’t let outsiders enter the cultivation room. But Xiao Yuxi was clearly not an outsider. Moreover, the Radiant Dimension wasn’t safe now, and he didn’t want to let her stay away from him, so the safest choice was to keep her by his side.

Xiao Yuxi glanced at the surroundings and nodded, “Alright!”

She’s never liked to be in contact with people. Besides that, cultivating here wouldn’t just allow her to improve her strength rapidly, she would even be able to be by Yang Ye’s side at all times.

Yang Ye stayed with her for a while before leaving the Primordial Pagoda.

Yang Ye looked up at the sky as he stood outside the hall. The sky was very calm, and it was without a trace of wind or clouds. It was abnormally calm.

It was the calm before the storm!

Yang Ye sat cross-legged on the ground and waited in silence.

A day later, Lu Wan’er, Yu Wushuang, and the others finally arrived.

Yu Wushuang had grown a little, and Lu Wan’er had grown mature.

Yu Wushuang had a slight smile on her face, “You’re back!”

Yang Ye nodded and was just about to speak when Lu Wan’er had walked over to him and embraced him. She didn’t speak a word and just embraced him tightly.

Yang Ye patted her back lightly and said, “I’m sorry for making you worry.”

Lu Wan’er let go of him and said, “Don’t vanish again.”

“I won’t!” Yang Ye gently wiped off the tears on her face and said, “I won’t do it again.”

He knew that every time something happened to him, Xiao Yuxi, Lu Wan’er, and the other girls were the most worried about him. He could understand how it would feel. So, he’d decided to keep them by his side.

Lu Wan’er nodded slightly, and then her expression returned to normal. She spoke seriously, “Is something about to happen here?”

Yang Ye nodded and glanced at the others, “Something huge might really be about to occur in the Radiant Dimension. For safety’s sake, come with me right now.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he gazed at Xiao Bieli and said, “Dean Xiao, make the needed arrangements. We’ll have to burden those at the Quasi Emperor Realm to help the others leave the Radiant Dimension.”

Xiao Bieli nodded, “Alright!”

Yang Ye nodded, and then he looked up at the sky, “Everyone, come with me!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye transformed into a ray of light that shot up into the sky.

Countless people immediately shot up into the air and followed closely behind Yang Ye.

There weren’t many of them, but there weren’t a few either. There were around 10,000. The Radiant Dimension was just a small world, and the Eye of the Heaven Dao was present here. So, it was extremely difficult to advance here.

Thus, there weren’t many at the Half-Saint Realm or above.

It didn’t take long for them to arrive high above the sky, and then many Half-Saints started to become unable to endure going further up. They were weak, and the pressure here wasn’t something that they could resist. Fortunately, they had Xiao Bieli and the others’ help, so they merely slowed down slightly.

Suddenly, the sky rippled, and then a huge eye appeared above them.

The Eye of the Heaven Dao!

As soon as it appeared above them, a wave of terrifying pressure slammed down upon them.

Countless cultivators turned ghastly pale when they experienced the pressure from the Eye of the Heaven Dao in close proximity. Some even couldn’t help but tremble.

Suddenly, Yang Ye pointed his finger upwards.

A ray of cold light moved at a speed they couldn’t even detect and slammed against the Eye of the Heaven Dao.

Bang!

The Eye of the Heaven Dao shattered.

“Let’s go!” As soon as he spoke, Yang Ye led them up higher.

It didn’t take long for them to stop again because a thin barrier of light had appeared above them.

The natural barrier of the Radiant Dimension!

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly, and then Heaven’s Gravestone appeared in his grasp. He sheathed it and drew it swiftly.

A ray of sword energy shot up and struck the barrier of light. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Bang!

It shattered into pieces.

“You’re trying to leave? Get the fuck back in there!” A voice came from outer space when the barrier shattered.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly, and then he flipped his right palm. The Heaven’s Gravestone was exchanged for the Sword Precursor. He sheathed it and spoke coldly, “Come with me! Let me see who can stop me!”
