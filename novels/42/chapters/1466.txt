Chapter 1467 – Your Character?

The more he thought about it, the more terrified he got!

If this really was Yellow Springs River, then he couldn’t continue forward!

Even though he was confident in his strength, it was Yellow Springs River.... Many people had warned him about it, so he couldn’t disregard it. After all, those who were much stronger than him had never returned from the other side of Yellow Springs River. Even if someone did appear once more, that person was dead.

Yang Ye wasn’t cowardly, but he had a clear understanding of his current strength. He was very strong in the eyes of ordinary Deities, but that was only in the eyes of ordinary Deities. Deities were everywhere in this place, and all of them were extremely strong. Simply speaking, the existences here weren’t from the same era as him! Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

One must always understand oneself. One should be aware of one’s strength and capabilities. Otherwise, the consequences would be horrible!

So, he had to figure out if it was Yellow Springs River!

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings, and then released his aura. His aura was like a gale that swept towards the surroundings. It didn’t take long for the miasma to be pushed back, and then an area of 3km with Yang Ye at the center had been cleared up!

At this moment, he saw the surroundings clearly.

It wasn’t a river. It was just a pool, a pool that covered an area of over 3km.

Yang Ye heaved a sigh of relief when he realized that it wasn’t a river.

If it was Yellow Springs River, then it represented that he’d gone the wrong way. Of course, that wasn’t a big problem because he could just change directions. However, he was afraid that he wouldn’t even have the chance to change directions!

Even though he couldn’t go to the other side of Yellow Springs River, who dared to guarantee that the river itself was devoid of danger?

Fortunately, it was just a pool!

Yang Ye heaved a sigh of relief. However, the pool beneath his feet suddenly started to spin, and then a terrifying suction force shot up into the air and sucked him into the pool

In an instant, the pool was calm once more.

Beneath the pool.

Yang Ye’s expression had changed drastically, and his sword intent and slaughter intent surged madly. However, they weren’t able to stop the suction force. Yang Ye was shocked, and he was about to draw his sword, but the suction force had vanished.

Because he’d arrived at the bottom!

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings. In the end, his gaze shot towards a spot not too far away from him. Because there was a door there.

“It has been so long since someone was able to get here!” Suddenly, a voice came from behind the door, “Come in.”

The voice was quite old and hoarse.

That wasn’t the most important point. The most important point was the door had swung open once the voice finished speaking. After that, the suction force appeared once more, and then Yang Ye was slowly sucked towards the door.

At this moment, Yang Ye had calmed down. He was about to resist it when the voice resounded once more, “There’s no need to resist it. I hold no ill intent towards you. If I did, you would be dead.”

As soon as the voice finished speaking, the suction force vanished.

Yang Ye fell silent for a moment, and then he started walking towards the door.

Flee?

He could guarantee that if he did, then the suction force would definitely appear right away. He could resist it. After all, he had so many demon beasts in the Primordial Pagoda. So long as the person behind the door wasn’t an expert beyond the Deity Realm, then he had the ability to fight back. However, he’d decided to see what the person behind the door wanted before deciding what he would do!

It didn’t take long for Yang Ye to walk through the door.

A ray of white light flashed, and then Yang Ye felt dazed. But it didn’t take long for him to return to normal. After that, the scene before him changed. At this moment, he was in a narrow chamber that was less than 30m wide. The chamber was made from unknown ore, and it was covered in various golden symbols that Yang Ye had never seen in his life.

Yang Ye withdrew his gaze, and then looked ahead. A grey robed old man was seated cross-legged there. The old man was very emaciated, and it wasn’t exaggerated to call him a bag of bones. Because he was so thin, the old man’s appearance seemed quite terrifying. Especially his eyes, his sockets seemed like that of a skeleton!

The old man’s hands were placed on his thighs, and they were bound by golden chains that were embedded in the wall behind the old man.

He was imprisoned!

The old man spoke abruptly, “It has been so long since someone has been able to get here!” However, he didn’t open his eyes.

Yang Ye asked, “Senior, may I know who you are?” Yang Ye was secretly vigilant as he spoke.

The old man replied, “You wouldn’t know me even if I told you!”

Yang Ye nodded. Actually, it was obvious that the old man had lived for countless years. Even if the old man was once a peerless expert, Yang Ye would still know nothing about the old man.

“I have to say, you’re the first Voider to get here!” The old man continued, “Based on the direction you were heading towards, you’re either going to the other side of Yellow Springs River or the Forest of Darkness? Hmm? You should be heading to the Forest of Darkness.”

Yang Ye frowned, “How did you know?”

The old man replied, “There’s Death Energy on you. That proves that you’re on the verge of death. Where else could you be going but the Forest of Darkness?”

“You have quite the discerning eye!” Yang Ye continued, “May I know why you brought me down here?”

The old man replied, “I haven’t spoken to anyone in a long time. I’m lonely, so I wanted to speak to someone!”

Yang Ye chuckled, “Senior, stop joking. I’m a very straightforward person, and I don’t like to beat around the bush. So, please be frank.”

The old man fell silent for a long time, and then he said, “See, I’ve been trapped here for so many years. I just want to take a breath of fresh air in the outside world. I just have such a small wish. You can help me with it, right?”

Yang Ye glanced at the golden chains around the old man’s hands and feet, and then he shook his head, “Senior, you must be joking. Your strength is extraordinary, yet even you can’t break open those chains, let alone me. Senior, you know that I’m a Voider. While I’m comparatively stronger than those at the same realm of cultivation, but if I’m compared to Senior.... Hah! I’ll just avoid striking a blow to my own confidence.”

The old man said, “But I want to go outside. What should I do then?”

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly, “Why don’t I get someone to save you?”

“You’re a really slippery fellow!” The old man chuckled, “Would you even come back if I let you leave?”

“I guarantee with my character!” Yang Ye spoke seriously, “I’ll definitely return.”

“Your character?” The old man said, “What’s that? Can it fill my stomach?”

Yang Ye gazed at the old man for a long time before he said, “Since you don’t believe me, then tell me what we should do. If it’s possible, I don’t mind helping you. After all, it’s an honor for me to have been able to meet an expert like you!”

Even though he’d said that, Yang Ye had started to become very vigilant.

The old man said, “I have a way, but you have to cooperate!”

Yang Ye spoke flatly, “Do tell me about it!”

The old man explained, “I’m not an unreasonable person. I know your current strength really is insufficient to destroy the chains. However, while you can’t do it now, you can in the future. Right?”

“That’s true!” Yang Ye nodded, “Alright, then I’ll come back to save you once I’ve grown stronger!” As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye turned around and started walking away.

However, the suction force appeared again, and then he couldn’t take another step forward.

The old man said, “Do you think I’m a fool?”

Yang Ye turned around and gazed at the old man, “Then what do you want?”

The old man laughed coldly, “What if you don’t come back? I’ll be direct. Cultivate here until you’re able to destroy the chains. Understand?”

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly, “Cultivate here until I can save you?”

The old man replied, “Yes!”

Yang Ye fell silent for a long time, and then he said, “There’s something I can’t figure out. Your strength is far greater than mine. I think that even if I attain the Deity Realm, I’ll probably still be inferior to you. But even you aren’t able to break free from those chains. So, even if I attain the Deity Realm, it wouldn’t help at all, right?”

That was what he was most curious about. The old man’s strength definitely surpassed his, and it had probably even surpassed the Deity Realm. However, even the old man couldn’t break free from the chains.

That was what he was most puzzled about!

“No, you’ll be able to break the chains once you attain the Deity Realm!” The old man continued, “This place has been corroded for countless years, and it isn’t as strong as it used to be. As for why I’m unable to do it myself, it isn’t something you should be worried about. You should be worried about how you’ll free me as soon as possible. Only once I’m free will you be able to gain freedom as well!”

Yang Ye gazed at the old man for a long time, and then he said, “I only have around two months to live. Do you think I can attain the Deity Realm in that time?”

“I forgot about that!” The old man thought for a moment and said, “That’s easy to resolve. Let’s do this. Give me a strand of your soul, and then travel to the Forest of Darkness. Come back here once you’ve obtained the Spring of Life. In that we, we....”

“Wait!” Yang Ye suddenly interrupted the old man, “You want me to give you a strand of my soul?”

The old man replied, “What? You’re unwilling?”

“Fuck you!” Yang Ye was instantly visibly furious, “You old dog! You think you’re so great?!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye’s profound energy surged madly into the ancient sheath, and then he drew his sword and swung it!

Two overlapped Heavenrends!
