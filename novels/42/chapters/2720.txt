Chapter 2721 – The Ordinary Sword!

Farewells!

If he were being honest, Yang Ye wasn’t very fond of this feeling.

Since the beginning, people had been leaving one after the other, and it wasn’t a very nice feeling. However, at most times, he had no other choice.

Just like these disciples of the Ancient Sword Sect!

He could bring them all together, but it wasn’t beneficial to anyone.

His enemies were too strong, and it would be easier for him to face them on his own.

As for these disciples, they would have more room to grow on their own, and they could learn to be more independent too!

That was a good thing for them!

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts and left.

Yang Ye didn’t know that many years from now, countless formidable sects of sword cultivators would appear in the world, but the strange thing was that these powerful sects from various different worlds had the same ancestor!

…

In a world of unknown name. It was the world Heng Wangu and the others had chosen.

Those who’d survived the battle that day had come here!

At a certain waterfall, Heng Wangu sat cross-legged on the ground while countless strands of spirit energy surged incessantly toward him. As more and more spirit energy surged into him, his injuries started to gradually recover. But when compared to Yang Ye, such recovery was quite slow.

It wasn’t just Heng Wangu, everyone from the End World was healing.

They’d exhausted a lot of their strength during the battle!

Suddenly, an old man walked over to Heng Wangu.

It was Mr. Jing.

Heng Wangu didn’t open his eyes while Mr. Jing said, “He’s leaving the Three Dimensional Universe!”

Obviously, he was speaking about Yang Ye.

Heng Wangu remained silent.

Mr. Jing asked, “Shall we pursue him?”

Heng Wangu opened his eyes while a grin of self-ridicule appeared on the corners of his mouth, “Pursue him? How? We can’t kill him anymore.”

He'd almost been killed during the previous battle with Yang Ye!

Even if he’d revealed his trump card, he still failed to defeat Yang Ye!

Especially after Yang Ye entered that crazed state. The might of Yang Ye’s attacks was simply horrifying!

Now, Yang Ye was an existence they couldn’t do anything to!

Mr. Jing fell silent.

Yang Ye really wasn’t someone the End World could kill anymore. Even if the End World had so many peak experts!

Mr. Jing restrained his thoughts and asked, “Then what should we do?”

Heng Wangu replied, “Heal first!”

Mr. Jing nodded and left.

Heng Wangu fell silent for a moment, and then he stood up and went to the bottom of a certain mountain. There was a cave there, and within the cave was a strange dark red glow.

Heng Wangu spoke solemnly, “We’re unable to kill him anymore!”

A short while passed before a voice resounded in the cave, “You’re not strong enough.”

Heng Wangu glanced into the cave, “And?”

The voice asked, “Do you want to grow stronger?”

Heng Wangu’s eyes narrowed slightly and were filled with vigilance.

“Haha…” The voice suddenly chuckled, “You really aren’t an ordinary idiot. Your first reaction is to be vigilant and not get happy.”Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Heng Wangu replied indifferently, “Be frank.”

The voice said, “Aren’t you cultivating a divine technique known as the Golden Bell?”

Heng Wangu frowned slightly, “You know of it?”

The voice replied, “I do. It’s a pretty good technique. Unfortunately, you haven’t cultivated it to its limits, and that’s why you failed to defend yourself against Yang Ye.”

Heng Wangu said, “Please provide me with your guidance!”

The voice replied, “You must use an extreme method to cultivate it to its extremes.”

Heng Wangu frowned slightly, “An extreme method? What kind of extreme method?”

The voice replied, “There are countless types of energy in this world, and the most suited to you are the Earth Energy, Life Energy, and Spatial Energy. If these energies are added to your technique, its power will definitely multiply, and so will its strength.”

Heng Wangu fell silent for a short while and asked, “How do I do it?”

The voice replied, “I’ll give you a secret technique. Look for a world and devour the Earth Energy, Spatial Energy, and Life Energy there. Just like that, continue until you feel that you’re at your limits!”

Heng Wangu frowned, “Devour a world?”

The voice replied, “Indeed.”

Heng Wangu fell silent.

The voice asked, “What? You think it’s cruel?”

Heng Wangu replied indifferently, “What do you think?”

The voice laughed coldly, “The truly strong trample on the corpses of countless to ascend to where they are. If you’re unwilling to grow stronger, there is only one outcome that awaits you, dying at Yang Ye’s hands or dying at Destiny’s hands. Destiny pushed Yang Ye forward now and aren’t doing anything themselves, coupled with the fact that they are busy suppressing some existences, this is an opportunity for you. You’ll never have another one if you don't grab it now.”

Heng Wangu fell silent for a long time and asked, “How strong are you?”

The voice laughed coldly, “What? Are you wondering if I can really fight Destiny?”

Heng Wangu nodded and was very frank.

Suddenly, a black hand stretched out within the cave.

Heng Wangu’s expression changed drastically, and he raised both his hands.

Boom!

A golden ray of light surged up from him, and then a thick golden shield appeared around him.

The Golden Bell!

However, as soon as the black hand touched it…

Boom!

The shield exploded apart and Heng Wangu was instantly blasted over 3km away!

As soon as he stopped his finger, a strand of blood seeped out from the corner of his mouth! He looked up at the cave with a solemn expression in his eyes, and he was absolutely shocked in his heart!

Terrifying strength!

Meanwhile, the voice resounded in Heng Wangu’s ears, “What do you think?”

Heng Wangu spoke solemnly, “If you’re so strong, why didn’t you just kill Yang Ye earlier? He’ll be a huge problem for us if he’s allowed to live! Moreover, he has the Good Sprite and Evil Beast. You would have immediately obtained them by killing him!”

The voice replied indifferently, “Yang Ye? He’s just a junior who’s quite a monstrous genius. He isn’t my target. Of course, I didn’t refrain from killing him because I was looking down on him, it’s because I couldn’t.”

Heng Wangu asked, “Why?”

The voice replied, “That attack was at the limit of the strength that I can reveal. If I use too much strength, everything will change?”

Heng Wangu asked solemnly, “Destiny?”

The voice replied, “What do you think?”

Heng Wangu shook his head, “If I were you, I would kill him even if it meant exposing myself. He’s too monstrous, no one will be able to stop him if he’s allowed to grow!”

The voice replied, “There are those who are even more terrifying than him. Don’t place too much of your attention on him. I’m sure you know what our true objective is. If I kill him and expose myself, then everything would come to an end.”

Heng Wangu spoke solemnly, “When will you strike back?”

The voice said, “When my strength recovers.”

Heng Wangu glanced at the cave, “You lost in the past, right?”

The voice laughed coldly in response, “I did. However, I lost to the complete form of Destiny and her sword. Besides that, if those bastards from the Four Dimension Universe hadn’t been keeping me busy, how could she have possibly…”

The voice fell silent for an instant at this point, and then it continued, “She was unmatched in the past, but she split herself into four now. Her strength is inferior to what it was, and that is an opportunity for us.”

Heng Wangu fell silent for a short while and said, “I know you have your own plans, and your own worries, but allow me to be honest. You’ll regret not killing him!”

Heng Wangu turned around and left.

In the cave.

A pitch black hand suddenly waved about within the cave, and then an endless stream of dark energy appeared within the cave.

The image of a sword gradually appeared within the dark cave!

The sword was pitch black, over a meter long, and without a hilt.

The sword was ethereal. Obviously, it wasn’t the real sword.

Meanwhile, countless strands of dark energy surged into the sword, and as they surged into it, the sword was gradually undergoing a change.

A long time passed before a figure appeared here.

If Yang Ye was here, he would definitely be shocked!

Because it was actually the master of Darkspace, the Dark Lord!

The Dark Lord glanced at the sword, “Master, what is this sword?”

A voice resounded within the cave, “Among the swords of the world, the Ordinary Sword is the best, and Destiny’s sword is right below it… In order to kill the strongest form of Destiny, a sword that can counter Justice is required. I’ve refined this sword for 67,000 years just to do that. Its body is almost formed, and if I can sacrifice the Good Sprite and Evil Beast to this sword, it will become the sword of Good and Evil. Then, it can even go against an Ordinary Sword, and it’ll definitely be the only sword that can go against the Ordinary Sword!”

The Dark Lord said, “Yang Ye isn’t easy to deal with now.”

The voice replied, “It’s fine. I’ll go for him myself once I’ve recovered more.”

The Dark Lord nodded, “There naturally won’t be any problems if you do it, Master. Right, the desolate race has entered the Eternal Kingdom with our help. However, there are survivors in War City.”

The voice replied, “They’re just a bunch of ants, ignore them. Tell Huang Ying to awaken the Divine Vein, I need it as a sacrifice for this sword!”

The Dark Lord hesitated, “The Divine Vein is the foundation of Eternal Kingdom, and if it’s removed… I’m afraid Huang Ying won’t allow it.”

“This world isn’t mine anymore, so what’s the point of letting the living beings of this world live? As for Huang Ying, kill him if he refuses and just get someone else to lead them!”

“Understood!” The Dark Lord bowed slightly and left.

The cave fell silent once more.

…

At a boundless river of stars, a sword cultivator in a cloud white robe walked slowly through the area. He walked for a long time before he suddenly stopped.

A pair of eyes soundlessly appeared in the space above him, and then a voice resounded, “Sword cultivator, why have you come here?”

The sword cultivator looked up, “A female sword cultivator told me that you people in the Four Dimensional Universe are very strong. So, I’ve come to spar with you. Don’t worry, I won’t kill you. It’ll be just a spar.”
