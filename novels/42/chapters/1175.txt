Chapter 1176 – Emperors Are Nothing Great As Well!

They would naturally not believe that Yang Ye could fight 3 Emperors on his own. After all, not to mention 3, they wouldn’t even believe that he could fight one. Because being able to fight Quasi Emperors at the Saint Realm was heaven defying enough.

As for fighting Emperors at the Saint Realm, it wasn’t unprecedented, but it only occurred once in a few thousand years. Of course, that was in the current Dark Hell Continent. If it was the Dark Hell Continent from tens of thousands of years ago, it had countless geniuses. So, not to mention their strength in Dark Hell Continent, their geniuses were even amongst the strongest in the other regions.

They didn’t believe that Yang Ye could fight an Emperor, but they felt that Yang Ye definitely had a trump card or the backing of someone or some power. In short, Yang Ye was their last hope right now.

Bang!

Suddenly, Void Rank intent surged out from within Yang Ye and swept up into the air to resist the grey robed old man’s terrifying aura.

Void Rank sword intent!

The others were shocked at the sight of this scene. Because they’d never imagined that Yang Ye actually possessed Void Rank sword intent!

A trace of surprise flashed through the old man’s eyes because there were very few sword cultivators on the continent, especially strong sword cultivators.

“You have some ability! But you’re still too weak!” The old man took a step forward, and his aura rained down and instantly suppressed Yang Ye’s Void Rank sword intent. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“Is that so?” A smile curled up on the corners of Yang Ye’s mouth, and he took a step forward as well. Void Rank slaughter intent shot up into the air. As soon as this 2nd intent appeared, the old man’s aura was instantly pushed back.

Void Rank slaughter intent!

Everyone here was astounded!

He possesses 2 types of intents!

They were beyond shocked! This even included Ye Liuyun, Mu Canglan, and the other Quasi Emperors amongst them. Obviously, they hadn’t expected Yang Ye to have comprehended both Void Rank sword intent and slaughter intent!

2 types of Void Rank intents! Where did such a monstrous genius come from?

Meanwhile, there was excitement on the faces of Yuan Feng and the others. Because they knew that Yang Ye was a peerless genius, and besides a power like the World Devastator Cult, there was no other power that could foster such a genius!

The old man looked Yang Ye in the eyes and asked, “Who are you!”

Yang Ye replied, “Who I am isn’t important!”

Yang Ye pointed at the woman in a blue dress and said, “We actually have no intention to go against the Dark Sky Sect, but it couldn’t be helped. She was too brainless and insisted on killing us. So, for the sake of our survival, we had no choice but to kill our way out of their encirclement. Now, allow me to display my sincerity once more. I’ll give her back to you, and we’ll let bygones be bygones, alright?”

“Are you joking?” The old man continued, “You killed so many members of my sect and even took one of our members hostage, yet you want to let bygones be bygones? Don’t you think it’s very laughable?”

Yang Ye looked the old man in the eye and said, “We have no intention to go against the Dark Sky Sect. But your people insisted on killing us. So we had no choice but to fight back. We couldn’t have just stood by idly and waited for death to arrive, right?”

“How laughable!” The old man laughed with ridicule, “Are you trying to reason with me?”

Yang Ye nodded, “Could it be that you don’t want to?”

“Reason? What’s that?” The old man had a wisp of disdain on the corners of his mouth, “You’ve lived for quite some time. Have your seniors not taught you that the fist is always in the right? If my Dark Sky Sect wants to kill you, then you should bear your neck and receive death!”

The others behind Yang Ye had utterly unsightly expressions on their faces when they heard the old man!

Meanwhile, Nan Shuang walked over to Yang Ye’s side and spoke softly, “Stupid! You can’t try to reason with people in this world. The more you try, the more they’ll think that you can be bullied and do all they can to bully you. Reason can only be used when both sides have almost equal strength, and that’s the only time that it’s possible for both sides to sit down and reason with each other. Or perhaps after you’ve crushed them, then they will beg you to reason with them even if you refuse to do so!”

Yang Ye rubbed Nan Shuang’s head and spoke softly, “In the past, some said that my character is too extreme, and I don’t know how to act according to the situation. I cause minor incidents to become huge incidents, and I make huge incidents go out of control.... There are many occasions that even I feel that it’s true.”

Yang Ye chuckled at this point and said, “But I’ve noticed that what they call acting according to the situation is mostly just the act of making a compromise to save a situation. If others want to hit me, I can’t resist them, and I even have to bring my face to them so that they can strike it. Because I would suffer endless problems once I hit back. In that way, the problem would grow more and more serious. Just like what happened earlier. They wanted to kill us, but we can’t kill them because once we do, then the problem we face would grow greater and greater. But we would die if we don’t kill them.”

Yang Ye gazed at Nan Shuang at this point, “Tell me, how should we act according to such situations?”

Nan Shuang thought for a moment and said, “Kill! Kill until no one dares to offend us. Just like the World Devastator Cult. No one dares to offend them because they are strong!”

Yang Ye roared with laughter and said, “Little Girl, you’re right! I, Yang Ye, refuse to make compromises to save the situation throughout my lifetime! If they dare to bully me, then I’ll repay it tenfold. If they dare to try and kill me, then I’ll kill that person even if it’s the Heaven Dao!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye walked over to the woman in a blue dress. Her expression changed as she thought that Yang Ye intended to kill her. She was about to speak when Yang Ye grabbed her by the shoulder and tossed her over to the old man.

Everyone here was stunned. Even the woman and the old man were stunned because none had expected Yang Ye to do that.

Yang Ye condensed an intent sword in his grasp as he looked up at the old man, “I’ve always looked down upon those who use women to threaten others. I, Yang Ye, disdain to use a woman to threaten my enemies! If your Dark Sky Sect wants to kill us, then come do it! Now!”

The old man took a deep and long glance at Yang Ye before he said, “Those women around you will be spared later!”

As soon as he finished speaking, the old man tapped his finger forward. A pitch black finger tore through space and carried a terrifying aura as it arrived above Yang Ye, and it was about to squash Yang Ye into mush.

Om!

A sword howl resounded abruptly, and then a ray of light shot up into the sky and struck the black finger. The black finger shook violently and shattered apart while the ray of light didn’t slow down at all as it shot straight at the old man.

The old man waved his right hand, and the woman instantly vanished on the spot. After that, he clenched his right fist and slammed it in Yang Ye’s direction.

Bang!

A dazzling ray of light flashed out from his fist, and it slammed against Yang Ye’s attack.

Suddenly, the old man’s pupils constricted, and his body moved sideways slightly. After that, the others watched with astonishment as the old man’s right arm flew up into the air.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye was 300m behind the old man.

The others were stunned on the spot!

It was the ultimate version of Death by a Thought!

The 1st attack was just a distraction, and Yang Ye’s true objective had been utilizing Death by a Thought. He naturally wouldn’t hold back against an Emperor, and he used all his strength as soon as he attacked!

However, he’d still underestimated Emperors slightly. Even though he’d killed numerous Emperors in the past, it was under the circumstances that he’d joined forces with Qiong Qi. Yet now, it was clearly not realistic for him to instantly kill an Emperor with ease while he was all by himself. Even if he was a Saint Now and his strength had improved tremendously, it still wasn’t realistic!

The old man turned around to gaze at Yang Ye while his arm was being restored at a visible speed. He gazed at Yang Ye with a solemn expression in his eyes, “I really did....”

He was about to speak when Yang Ye withdrew an ancient sheath, and then sheathed and drew his sword in an instant. A ray of sword energy shot forward, and it was swift as a bolt of lightning. Space was sliced apart in its wake, forming a very long spatial rift in the sky.

It was 150 overlapped Heavenrends!

Once he attained the Saint Realm, he was able to overlap 150 Heavenrends at once! Coupled with the boost provided by his dual intents and physical strength, the strength of that attack was extremely terrifying.

The old man’s face immediately became extremely serious when he saw the ray of sword energy that was approaching him.

“Spatial Concentration!” As soon as he spoke, the old man waved both his hands, and the space around him instantly started to concentrate in layers. In an instant, the space before him had overlapped by at least 100 layers. It even caused the old man’s figure to seem warped when the others looked at him from the other side. Meanwhile, Yang Ye’s sword energy slammed against the overlapped layers of space.

Bang!

A loud explosion resounded through the sky!

Yang Ye’s sword energy sliced through the space before the old man, but it didn’t take long for it to stop. After that, the space there suddenly started to warp. In an instant, Yang Ye’s sword energy was crushed into bits.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye stomped his right foot against the space below him, and his figure shook before he transformed into a ray of light that swept towards the old man.

Bang!

The space before the old man collapsed in an instant, and then countless rays of light flickered incessantly through the sky and surrounded the old man.

It didn’t take long for numerous explosions to resound through the sky, and the space there was even trembling without end.

Meanwhile, the others on the ground below were absolutely shocked as they witnessed the battle occurring in the sky above.

It was a battle between a Saint and an Emperor!

Something that they’d only heard of had actually occurred right before their eyes.

Bang!

Meanwhile, a muffled explosion resounded in the sky, and then a figure was blasted away. The spectators’ hearts shook when they witnessed this scene. Because that figure was Yang Ye!

Yang Ye finally stopped after flying almost 3km back.

Yang Ye looked down at his chest, and he saw a palm print there. But it was very shallow. He looked up at the old man, and he saw the old man’s face had a bloody injury on it. It was an injury created by sword energy.

“I really did underestimate you!” The old man clenched his fists and said, “But don’t worry. I won’t do that again.”

As soon as he finished speaking, the space around Yang Ye and the old man instantly started to ripple like a surging river.

Meanwhile, the intent sword in Yang Ye’s grasp dispersed slowly, and he unclenched his fists. The Fire Dragon Gauntlets appeared over his hands as he turned around to look at Nan Shuang. A slight smile curled up onto the corners of his mouth as he said, “Actually, Emperors are nothing great as well!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he clenched his right fist slowly.

Crack!

A clear and resounding crack arose.

The space around his fist had cracked apart!
