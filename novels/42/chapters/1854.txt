Chapter 1855 – Death Is A Form Of Release!

Once those two auras appeared, the monkey immediately looked up, and a vicious glow flashed through his eyes. After that, the golden rob in his grasp transformed into a golden ray of light that shot up into the sky.

Boom!

Gu Huan and Xiao Hanyi’s auras were obliterated in an instant. A huge card and a black spear suddenly appeared in the sky, and they slammed against the golden rod.

The monkey raised his right hand and twisted it in their direction.

Bang!

Yang Ye watched with astonishment as the golden rod swept horizontally in midair. The huge card instantly cracked apart into pieces while the spear broke into two!

Yang Ye couldn’t help but gulp. Isn’t his strength a little too crazy?

Meanwhile, the monkey waved his right hand, and the golden rod instantly transformed into a ray of golden light that returned to his grasp. At the same time, Gu Huan and Xiao Hanyi appeared in the sky. At this moment, both of them had extremely solemn expressions on their faces.

Suddenly, their expressions changed because the monkey gazed at them. They didn’t hesitate to turn around and run in response. In just an instant, they’d vanished from Yang Ye and the Monkey’s fields of vision.

The monkey frowned when he saw them flee, but he didn’t chase after that. Suddenly, numerous powerful auras appeared in the sky. Obviously, they were the others who were pursuing Yang Ye.

Yang Ye glanced at the monkey, and then he turned around and fled. If he didn’t flee now, then when? However, he’d just started moving when a golden rod appeared in front of him and obstructed his path.

Yang Ye’s face stiffened.

Yang Ye turned to look at the monkey. Meanwhile, the monkey looked up at the sky, and then he waved his right hand. In an instant, the golden rod behind Yang Ye shot up into the air, and then it suddenly expanded by a few dozen times!

A huge golden rod that was over 1km long swept through the air…

‘AH! AH! AH!...” Shrill cries resounded, and it didn’t take long for those auras to vanish like a receding tide.

Three breaths of time later, the sky had returned to calm.

Meanwhile, the monkey waved his right hand, and the golden rod appeared in his grasp before he turned to look at Yang Ye.

Yang Ye’s face was quite unsightly when he saw the monkey look at him. The monkey’s strength was absolutely extraordinary. If the monkey were to attack him, he would definitely be incapable of fighting the monkey with his current strength!

Suddenly, the monkey’s gaze descended onto the wooden sword in Yang Ye’s grasp, “What’s it doing in your possession?”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and replied, “It dropped down from above, and then I just happened to obtain it!”

The monkey gazed at Yang Ye for a long time, and then he turned around and started walking away. Suddenly, he looked up at the sky, and then he vanished on the spot.

Yang Ye was stunned, and then a solemn expression gradually appeared on his face.

How fast!

The monkey’s speed was even much faster than him when he executed the Grand Teleportation Technique!

Suddenly, a ray of golden light shot down from the sky, and then it descended before Yang Ye. The light dispersed to reveal a bald man.

The bald man glanced at the surroundings, and then he gazed at Yang Ye, “Did you see a monkey?”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and shook his head. The monkey had helped him, so he would naturally not expose the monkey’s whereabouts. Because he could sense that the monkey hadn’t really left, and the monkey had just somehow concealed himself.

The bald man gazed at Yang Ye for a long time and said, “You’re lying!”

Yang Ye was stunned speechless.

Meanwhile, the bald man added, “That monkey possesses a violent nature, so allowing it to stay will only bring death to the living beings of this universe.”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and asked, “Is that monkey stronger than me?”

The bald man nodded slightly, “You’re naturally unable to compare to him.”

Yang Ye glanced at the bald man. Doesn’t he know how to be tactful?

Meanwhile, the bald man added, “What are you trying to say?”

Yang Ye replied, “That monkey is far stronger than me, so how could I possibly know where he is?”

The bald man was about to speak when he suddenly gazed at the wooden sword in Yang Ye’s grasp.

Yang Ye’s expression changed slightly when he saw this, Crap!

The bald man suddenly said, “The Sovereign of Man’s sword is actually in your possession.”

He paused for a moment and continued, “It’s extremely holy, and it’s a precious treasure of the human race. Yet you are extremely sly and possess the Heart of Slaughter. If it’s in your hands, it’ll one day bring calamity to the human race. Fine, since I witnessed this, then I’ll just eliminate you, take this sword, and eliminate a disaster for the human race. You….”

Suddenly, Yang Ye vanished on the spot, and then a speck of cold light appeared before the bald man’s forehead.

Yang Ye had attacked!

The more he listened to the bald man, the more he felt that something was off, and when he heard the last things the bald man said, he’d decisively chosen to attack. He planned to launch the first strike. As for whether he was a match for the bald man, he didn’t think about it. The most important thing was to attack right now while he still had a better chance!

Right when Yang Ye’s sword was about to stab against the bald man’s forehead, a ray of golden light suddenly enveloped the bald man and stopped Yang Ye’s sword. At the same time, a strand of golden light flowed along Yang Ye’s sword and slammed against his chest. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Bang!

Yang Ye was blasted over 10km away. He hadn’t even stopped himself when the bald man suddenly took a step forward, and then he was in front of Yang Ye. After that, he grabbed the wooden sword before Yang Ye could even react.

A huge wave of force struck Yang Ye’s hand, causing him to be unable to help but release his grip. After that, the sword fell into the bald man’s hands. At the same time, Yang Ye was blasted around another 10km away!

“Come back!” Suddenly, Yang Ye’s voice resounded, and then the wooden sword suddenly trembled violently in the bald man’s hand, and then it transformed into a ray of light that vanished from the bald man’s grasp and returned to Yang Ye’s grasp.

After that, Yang Ye appeared before the bald man, and then he stabbed the wooden sword at the bald man. It shot straight for the bald man’s forehead.

This time, his sword hadn’t even arrived in front of the bald man’s forehead before a thumb-sized bead slammed against the tip of the wooden sword.

Bang!

The wooden sword shook violently, and then Yang Ye was pushed back repeatedly.

The bald man shook his head, “Put down your weapon and be cleansed.”

Yang Ye stopped and glanced at his right arm. At this moment, it had cracked open, and blood was flowing from it. He looked up at the bald man and said, “I don’t know if I’ll be cleansed if I put down my weapon, but I know that I’ll die!”

The bald man pressed his palms together, “Death is a form of release!”

Yang Ye asked, “Then why don’t you get your release?”

The bald man glanced at Yang Ye and shook his head, “Since you refuse to be sensible, then I have no choice but to send you off.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he suddenly stretched out his right hand, and then a golden bead shot out from his palm. It was extremely swift to the point Yang Ye couldn’t see its movements, and he relied on his instincts to swing his sword!

Bang!

A ray of golden light suddenly exploded apart in front of Yang Ye, and then Yang Ye was blasted away.

The bald man waved his right hand, and the golden bead immediately flew back to him. However, there were some cracks on it.

The bald man looked up at Yang Ye and said, “As expected of the Sovereign of Man’s sword. It can even damage this bead. Looks like that sword can’t be allowed to fall into the hands of an evildoer like you. Otherwise, the living beings of the world will be in danger!”

He was about to attack again when a ray of golden light suddenly appeared behind him, and then a golden rod slammed down towards his head.

The bald man’s expression changed, and then he pressed his palms together before slapping them forward.

Golden light surged out from his palms.

Boom!

A rumbling explosion resounded, and then the bald man was smashed into the ground.

Yang Ye was stunned by this and intended to attack the bald man. However, a hand suddenly grabbed his shoulder, and then he vanished on the spot.

Less than two breaths of time after they left, a ray of golden light emerged from below the ground. The golden light dispersed to reveal the bald man. At this moment, he had an extremely gloomy expression on his face, but it didn’t take long for his expression to become calm once more. Moreover, there wasn’t even a trace of emotion in his eyes!

He glanced at the surroundings and said, “Let me see how long you’ll be able to run for!”

He took a step forward and vanished on the spot.

Far away in the distance, a ray of golden light flashed through the starry sky, and it moved at an indescribable speed.

Yang Ye and the monkey were within the golden light.

Yang Ye gazed at the monkey and asked, “Why didn’t you try to kill him?”

The monkey glanced at Yang Ye, “Both of us would be dead if we left a little later!”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Why? Wasn’t he blasted away by a single swing of your rod?”

The monkey shook his head, “He has a divine treasure. I wouldn’t have to fear him if I was at my prime, but at this moment, he can use that treasure to kill me within three breaths of time. As for you, it won’t even take half a breath of time!”

Yang Ye was stunned speechless.

Yang Ye remained silent. He naturally didn’t think that the monkey was just trying to scare him because the monkey had no reason to do so.

A short while passed before Yang Ye gazed at the monkey, “What’s your name?”

The monkey glanced at Yang Ye and said, “Qi…”
