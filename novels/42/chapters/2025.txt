Chapter 2026 – Back to the Sky Dimension!

The black robed figure intended to leave after saying those words.

Suddenly, the black robed figure turned around, “Show yourself!”

The space there trembled, and then the masked old man suddenly appeared here again.

The masked old man asked, “Who are you?”

The black robed man replied, “I can’t answer that question. But don’t worry, I have no ill intent towards your Ji Clan!”

The masked old man remained silent.

The black robed man added, “Actually, I never expected another Sage Spirit Body to appear in your Ji Clan. Hehe! How interesting!”

The masked old man vanished on the spot when he heard this.

Boom!

A moment later, the space in a huge area collapsed. At the same time, everything in a large area was obliterated in an instant.

A long time passed before the space here was slowly repaired by the Laws of the world.

Their gazes met in midair.

The black robed man patted his sleeve and chuckled, “Protecting her with an expert who’s just half a step away from the Sage Realm. Tsk, tsk! Such extravagance!”

The masked old man glanced at the black robed man and didn’t attack again.

Meanwhile, the black robed man said, “Looks like the Ji Clan is planning something huge. But that’s fine, it has nothing to do with me. I have other matters to attend to, farewell!”

The black robed man vanished.

Once the black robed man vanished, the veiled woman appeared here on her wheelchair.

She glanced indifferently at the spot where the black robed man had vanished, and she asked, “Uncle Jiang, are you able to determine his origins?”

The masked old man shook his head, “However, he should be linked to Yang Ye because he was following Yang Ye too!”

The veiled woman nodded, “Uncle Jiang, there’s no need to worry. There are some things that’ll come no matter what, and as for those that refuse to come, they won’t come no matter how you try. So, just go on with life!”

The masked old man nodded, “Young Miss, let’s go!”

They vanished on the spot.

…

Once Yang Ye left the Devil Dimension, we went to the Sky Dimension. However, right when he was about to enter the Sky Dimension, a mysterious person covered in a black robe appeared in front of him.

The mysterious person said, “The Ji Clan!”

Yang Ye sized up the mysterious person and asked, “How are we doing this?”

The mysterious person said, “The Sovereign of Sky has sent his forces to guard the entrance. He’ll be immediately notified if you enter the Sky Dimension. We have to use another way to get in!”

He drew a circle on the ground, and then a faint light blue circle appeared there.

A teleportation formation!

The mysterious person said, “Let’s go!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he entered the circle, and Yang Ye didn’t hesitate to follow him.

It didn’t take long for the teleportation formation to tremble violently, and then they vanished on the spot.

A long time later, Yang Ye opened his eyes. They were above an ocean.

The mysterious person said, “I’ve found out that the Sovereign of Man has Yu Jing locked in the sky race’s highest security prison, Sky Prison. Even though there aren’t any Sages guarding that place, there’s an expert who’s half a step away from the Sage Realm. We can’t go head-on against him!”

At the same time, Yang Ye and the mysterious person had snuck into Sky City.

After they entered the city, the mysterious person said, “My Ji Clan will try to draw that Half-Step Sage away from there, and we’ll leave the rest to you. It isn’t a problem, right?”

Yang Ye nodded, “No problem!”

The mysterious person said, “Come with me!”

They went to the south of the city, and there was a black hall before them.

The mysterious person said, “This is Sky Prison, and it’s considered the highest security prison in the Sky Dimension. It holds criminals of the sky race and some experts from the devil race. Especially those experts from the devil race. In order to prevent their escape the sky race sent a Half-Step Sage Realm expert to guard the prison.”

Yang Ye asked, “How will you draw them away?”

The mysterious person replied, “We have our ways. Just remember that even if that expert is gone, you must not be careless. Even we don’t know the true situation in this prison. However, it definitely has other defensive measures. In short, it’s all up to you!”

The mysterious person didn’t say another word and just vanished.

Yang Ye waited for around 15 minutes, and then an aura suddenly flashed out from the prison. At the same time, the space in front of Yang Ye trembled, and then a voice came from there, “Go!”

Yang Ye didn’t hesitate to transform into a shadow that entered the hall.

The entire hall had been under the divine sense of that expert, but now that he’d left, Yang Ye was able to sneak into the Sky Prison without encountering any problems.

It was ghastly!

That was Yang Ye’s first opinion of it upon entering the prison!

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings, and it was completely empty. Yang Ye was about to continue forward, but an armored man suddenly appeared not too far away from Yang Ye. The man scanned the surroundings and frowned.

Yang Ye stood completely still on the spot, and even his aura was completely concealed beneath the Sword Domain.

A long time passed before the armored man left. However, Yang Ye still didn’t move. Just like that, around 15 minutes passed before the armored man appeared again. He glanced at the surroundings and left once more!

However, Yang Ye still didn’t move.

Around 10 minutes later, the man appeared once more, and he scanned the surroundings carefully before leaving.

Once the armored man left again, Yang Ye finally continued forward.

It didn’t take long for him to see many black cages, and they were like iron cages. People were kept within them. Because he was using the Sword Domain, no one noticed Yang Ye’s presence.

Yang Ye continued forward while ceaselessly scanning those cages. It didn’t take long for him to stop.

There was a black cage not too far to his right, and there was a man in it. It was Yu Jing!

Yang Ye was visibly relieved when he saw Yu Jing and went over to the cage. However, Yu Jing hadn’t noticed Yang Ye’s presence.

Yang Ye glanced at the cage, and he noticed light flickering throughout the cage. Obviously, it wasn’t ordinary.

Meanwhile, a sword tapped down lightly against the cage. At the same time, a strand of mysterious energy completely enveloped the cage. It didn’t take long for the cage to tremble. However, because of the Sword Domain, the commotion here didn’t alarm anyone in the surroundings!

However, Yu Jing had noticed it.

Yu Jing was slightly stunned when he saw Yang Ye, and said, “What are you doing here?”

Yang Ye shook his head and didn’t say anything. He just slowly broke through the cage with his sword. It didn’t take long for the cage to vanish before him.

Yang Ye said, “Let’s go!”

Yu Jing didn’t waste his breath and left with Yang Ye. It didn’t take long for them to leave the prison safely. However, as soon as that happened, a loud commotion came from within the prison.

A furious shout resounded through the sky above the prison, “Seal the surroundings immediately! Don’t let a single person or aura go!”

As soon as the voice resounded, numerous divine senses swept out towards the surroundings.

A short while later, Yang Ye said, “Let’s go!”

Yang Ye snuck out of the city with Yu Jing, and they saw the mysterious man outside the city.

“Come with me!” The mysterious man vanished on the spot once he finished speaking.

Yang Ye and Yu Jing immediately followed him.

…

In a hall within Sky City. A middle aged man gazed at the old man down below, “Do you know who it was?”

The old man shook his head slightly, “They took that kid of mine, and then allowed him to notify me and draw me away. However, it should have been Yang Ye.”

The middle aged man said, “It wasn’t just him. Someone was helping.” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

As he spoke, the middle aged man closed his eyes slowly, “Investigate! Use all our resources! Let me see who it was!”

…

Outside Sky City, Yang Ye and Yu Jing followed the mysterious person to a forest, and then the mysterious person gazed at Yang Ye, “Because we helped you, the bases my Ji Clan has been maintaining for many years throughout the Sky Dimension have to disappear. So, please remember your promise!”

As he spoke, he flicked a ray of white light into Yang Ye’s forehead, “It’s the location of my Ji Clan. Please make a trip to my Ji Clan. Farewell! Right, the Sovereign of Sky will probably immediately send the “Sky’s Eye” to track you down, and it will definitely not take them long. So, it’s best if you leave the Sky Dimension as soon as possible!”

The mysterious man vanished once he finished speaking.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye raised his right hand, and a ball of white light appeared before Yu Jing, “This is for you!”

Yu Jing was puzzled, “What’s that?”

Yang Ye smiled, “A little toy.”

He patted Yu Jing on the shoulder, “Live well. Let’s all get together another day.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye transformed into a ray of light that vanished into the sky.

Yu Jing was stunned for quite some time, and then he gazed at the white ball of light. He flicked it, and it instantly entered his forehead.

Yu Jing’s figure stiffened on the spot!

A long time passed before he opened his eyes, and a middle aged man appeared before him.

It was Yu Jing’s father!

Yu Jing gazed at the middle aged man, “Dad, do you know what it was?”

The middle aged man shook his head.

Yu Jing said, “The inheritance of an expert from our sky race. The inheritance of a Sage!

A Sage’s inheritance!

The middle aged man was stunned, “Really?”

Yu Jing replied, “What do you think?”

The middle aged man shivered.

Yu Jing looked up at the sky, and it was in the direction Yang Ye had vanished towards. A long time passed before he said, “Dad, would you give a brother of yours the inheritance of a Sage?”

The middle aged man remained silent.

Yu Jing’s face gradually turned icy cold, “Tell my great grandfather that his grandson has obtained the inheritance of a Sage. However, I have a condition. If he wants me to return to the Yu Clan, I want to be the Yu Clan’s patriarch.”
