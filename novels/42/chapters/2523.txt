Chapter 2524 – The Five World Realm!

“Talk?” The old man sized up Yang Ye, “You don’t want to fight anymore?”

Yang Ye hurriedly shook his head, “Of course not, that’ll spoil our relationship!”

The old man walked over to Yang Ye and sized him up again, “You’re a new elite disciple?”

Yang Ye nodded, “I am.”

The old man nodded slightly, “No wonder you look unfamiliar.”

Yang Ye smiled, “It’s my first time here!”

The old man turned around and shot a glance at the cave, “Do you know the rules?”

Yang Ye shook his head.

The old man explained, “Don’t act rashly in there and disturb the rest of our seniors, understand?”

Yang Ye nodded, “I understand!”

The old man nodded slightly and went back to rest at the side.

Yang Ye ignored the old man and entered the cave.

Once Yang Ye entered, the old man suddenly glanced at Yang Ye’s vanishing figure with a rather complicated expression on his face!

…

The space within the cave was huge, but it wasn’t very bright inside. There was a dark and gloomy atmosphere to it.

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings and noticed nothing.

After walking for a while, he said, “Have you found it?”

A short while passed before Sword Scroll replied, “Continue forward!”

Forward!

Yang Ye nodded and went further in. A short while later, an ethereal man appeared before him!

A soul?

Yang Ye glanced at the man and asked, “Senior, do you need something?”

The man floated over to Yang Ye, sized him up, and said, “Your aura of slaughter is too strong. A pity, a pity indeed!”

He turned around and vanished on the spot.

Yang Ye was stunned and asked, “What did he mean?”

Sword Scroll replied, “He sensed the aura of your Sword Dao, and so he came. However, your desire to kill is too strong, and it doesn’t conform to his Sword Dao.”

Yang Ye shook his head, smiled, and didn’t think too much about it. He just continued off into the distance.

The entire Sword Cave was extremely deep, and he encountered the souls of many sword cultivators along the way. However, all of them didn’t choose him.

Yang Ye didn’t mind. In any case, his Sword Dao had its own form, and he didn’t need the path of others”

“Stop!” Suddenly, Sword Scroll’s voice resounded.

Yang Ye stopped and she spoke again, “To the right!”

Yang Ye turned to look, and he saw a pillar of light at the end of his vision. There were some fragments in it, a pile of random fragments!

Sword Scroll’s main body!

Yang Ye took a deep breath and was about to go over when Sword Scroll spoke abruptly, “Be careful!”

Yang Ye nodded, glanced at the surroundings, and walked over to it. However, as soon as he arrived there, an old man appeared before him.

The old man was small and thin like a child, and he had an aged appearance with shocking wrinkles!

The old man didn’t even look up as he said, “Leave!”

Yang Ye glanced at the old man, and Sword Scroll said, “Gu Nan!”

Yang Ye asked, “Gu Nan?”

Sword Scroll spoke solemnly, “He’s the guardian of this Super Divine Treasure, and his strength is beyond you!”

Yang Ye glanced at the old man, and the old man’s divine sense enveloped him. Moreover, an invisible wave of pressure pressed down upon him.

Yang Ye resisted the pressure while he asked Sword Scroll, “Do you have any way to get past him?”

She fell silent for a long time and replied, “I don’t!”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

Meanwhile, Gu Nan looked up at Yang Ye, “Leave!”

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and said, “The Grand Elder said that I can stay here and seek my own fortune.”

Gu Nan replied, “Go look for it somewhere else.”

Yang Ye spoke seriously, “I think it’s right here!”

Gu Nan frowned.

Yang Ye spoke seriously, “Senior, I’m not joking. I think I’m being summoned by what’s within this pillar of light, I’m serious!”

Gu Nan stared at Yang Ye, “Do you want to die?”

Yang Ye’s face stiffened, but it only took a moment for it to return to normal, “Senior, the Grand Elder said that I can obtain my own fortune here. But you’re stopping me from that. T-Trust me, I’m going to tell the Grand Elder about this!”

Gu Nan replied indifferently, “Go on! Hurry!”

He isn’t afraid?

Yang Ye was quite stunned.

He's not even afraid of the Grand Elder?

Meanwhile, Sword Scroll’s voice resounded in his mind, “He was the Grand Elder during my time, so do you think he would be afraid?”

Yang Ye was stunned speechless.

Meanwhile, Gu Nan’s gaze gradually turned icy cold.

Yang Ye fell silent. Sword Scroll’s main body was right before him, and he was quite unwilling to just leave!

Sword Scroll said, “Leave for now! We’ll think of something later!”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and gazed at the pillar of light, “Senior, I want it. What do I need to do in order to obtain it?”

He was being very direct!

Gu Nan glanced at Yang Ye and replied indifferently, “The Sect Master or Junior Sect Master, alright?”

The Sect Master or Junior Sect Master!

Yang Ye frowned slightly because that was really too difficult!

“Don’t be rash!” Sword Scroll’s voice resounded once more, “His strength is beyond you right now. Even if you use the Sword Domain, you’re still no match for him. Moreover, even if you defeat him, how will you deal with the other experts of the Ancient Sword Sect? Leave for now and think of something later.”

Yang Ye tried his best to make himself calm down, and then he nodded and left.RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Gu Nan glanced at Yang Ye’s figure, and once he was sure that Yang Ye had left, he vanished on the spot as well.

Yang Ye left the Sword Cave. He glanced at the old man at the entrance, and then he walked away.

Yang Ye returned to his abode and entered the Primordial Pagoda.

He was extremely unhappy!

After all, Sword Scroll’s body had been just there, but he couldn’t obtain it!

After remaining silent for a short while, Yang Ye said, “Sword Scroll, can you show yourself?”

Sword Scroll had possessed an extremely prominent status in the Ancient Sword Sect, and if she showed herself, the Ancient Sword Sect would probably not make things difficult for her.

She replied indifferently, “If I do that, I may never leave this place again.”

Yang Ye fell silent.

She said, “Why don’t you just become the Junior Sect Master?”

Yang Ye felt speechless.

She said, “In the Ancient Sword Sect, the Junior Sect Master holds quite a bit of authority because the Sect Master is almost always in closed door cultivation. So, most matters are managed by the Junior Sect Master. If you take that position, you’ll be able to rightfully obtain my main body’s fragments.”

Yang Ye laughed bitterly, “Sword Scroll, is it that easy to become the Junior Sect Master? Haven’t you noticed? The higher-ups of the Ancient Sword Sect are being very wary of me, and they will definitely suspect me if I try to become the Junior Sect Master. It isn’t worth it!”

Sword Scroll fell silent.

Yang Ye appeared before her, glanced at her, and said, “I don’t like to play tricks like that. I do want to help you get back your main body, but…”

He shook his head and laughed bitterly, “It was too difficult.”

Sword Scroll nodded and didn’t say anything.

Yang Ye looked down and sighed. Both Sword Scroll and him weren’t really able to leave just like that. But it was absolutely not easy to become the Junior Sect Master.

Or it should be said to be very difficult!

After all, the Ancient Sword Sect was still wary of him!

If he wanted to fight for the position, it was obvious that the Ancient Sword Sect would be even more suspicious of him. Moreover, once he did become the Junior Sect Master, how would he face the Ancient Sword Sect? After all, he was Yang Ye, not Ye Yang!

At that time, it would be even more troublesome!

But he still wanted to try!

One should always live a life without regrets, and he was really unable to just forget about Sword Scroll’s main body and leave!

However, he couldn’t ask to become the Junior Sect Master, and he had to make them think he was the best choice and make them ask him instead!

Bang!

Suddenly, a powerful aura surged out from the rear mountains of the Sword Sect.

The aura instantly interrupted Yang Ye and Sword Scroll’s thoughts. They exchanged glances and vanished on the spot.

Yang Ye and Sword Scroll went to the Primal True Dragon’s territory. It was lying on the ground while waves of powerful aura rippled out incessantly from it.

The aura was rippling incessantly through the surrounding space. If it hadn’t been strengthened by the old man with the bamboo chest, the aura would have shattered the world within the Primordial Pagoda!

Meanwhile, the dragon was gradually growing larger!

It was on the verge of advancement!

Yang Ye was delighted because it was clearly advancing after consuming the Origin World Pill.

It was at the Four World Realm now, and it would be at the Five World Realm once it advanced!

Moreover, it wouldn’t be an ordinary Five World Realm demon beast!

Just like that, Yang Ye and Sword Scroll watched for around an hour before clear and melodious sounds resounded throughout the dragon’s body, and then it opened its eyes!

Golden light flickered in the dragon’s eyes!

The dragon suddenly shot up into the air, and then a colossus appeared in the sky while dragon roars resounded incessantly.

The Five World Realm!

The dragon had finally broken through and attained the Five World Realm!

Yang Ye smiled, and then he looked in Oxxy’s direction. It only took a moment for him to arrive at Oxxy’s territory. Oxxy was seated on the ground with his eyes closed, and powerful ripples were surging from him!

The aura didn’t belong to the Four World Realm at all!

Besides Oxxy, Yang Ye noticed that the others’ auras were much stronger than before too!

Yang Ye didn’t leave the Primordial Pagoda during this time because he was afraid something unexpected would occur during their advancement. After all, advancements didn’t always go smoothly! So, he had to stay watch!

Just like that, a day later, Oxxy attained the Five World Realm!

Two days later, the Primal Vicious Tiger was at the Five World Realm!

10 days later, all the demons in the Primordial Pagoda were at the Five World Realm!

6 Five World Realm demon beasts!
