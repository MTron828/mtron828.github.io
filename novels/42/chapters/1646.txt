Chapter 1647 - Didn’t You Want To Fight?

Translator: InVader

40%!

She’d only used 40% of her strength to render a Zenith Realm expert like Yang Xu completely powerless before her!

The expressions of everyone here became quite unsightly when they heard her. Of course, their faces were mostly covered in shock.

Yang Xu was no ordinary Zenith Realm expert, he was a true senior Zenith Realm expert, and he wasn’t an existence that ordinary Zenith Realm experts could compare to.

If Yang Ye took his opponent by surprise, then he was usually able to instantly annihilate Zenith Realm experts! However, he couldn’t do that to Yang Xu, and that was the difference between Yang Xu and those other Zenith Realm experts!

Actually, instantly killing them wasn’t terrifying. The truly terrifying thing was suppressing Yang Xu like how An Nanjing had. She’d merely used 40% of her strength to completely suppress Yang Xu and render him completely powerless to fight back.

How terrifying was that?

Not to mention the people here, even Yang Ye felt that it was quite terrifying. An Nanjing’s strength was so powerful that even he felt it was quite unusual!

However, An Nanjing paid no attention to the gazes coming from the surroundings. She just went over to Yang Ye’s side and stood there with her hands behind her back. She seemed like a god of war.

Yang Ye was extremely weak right now, so he needed her protection.

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings, sat down cross-legged, and then swallowed an Energy Pearl to recover.

Yang Xu’s family weren’t the only ones in the Yang Clan who wanted to kill him. There were many others.

An hour later and after swallowing two Energy Pearls in succession, his profound energy had been completely recovered, and even his physical strength had recovered fully. Besides that, he’d regrown the right arm he’d lost in battle earlier. The Primordial Violet Energy’s speed of recovery was terrifying as always.

Yang Ye stood up and went over to the city walls. Yang Xu and Yang Yan were there. One was hung there, and the other was nailed there.

What would Yang Ye do?

Countless people wondered about the same thing.

Yang Ye’s gaze descended onto Yang Yan. At this moment, Yang Yan wasn’t proud anymore, and he was terrified and in a sorry state.

His body had been destroyed, and only his soul remained. So, if Yang Ye acted against him, he wouldn’t even have the chance to be reincarnated. Besides that, he didn’t want to be reincarnated, or to be more precise, he didn’t want to die.

However, he did have some backbone and didn’t beg for mercy.

Suddenly, Yang Ye slapped his palm in Yang Xu’s direction.

Bang!

Yang Xu’s body exploded apart in an instant, but his soul still remained. Now, both Yang Xu and Yang Yan only had their souls left.

Yang Xu stared at Yang Ye, “Yang Ye, what do you want?”

“What do I want?” Yang Ye smiled fiercely, “Why don’t you guess?”

Yang Xu spoke in a low voice, “Yang Ye, we admit defeat…”

“You admit defeat?” Yang Ye chuckled, “Do you have a choice?”

Yang Xu stared at Yang Ye, “Do you really intend to leave no room for maneuver?”

“That’s exactly what I want!” Yang Ye’s face was ferocious. He waved his right hand, and the pieces of the Soul Whip which he’d blasted apart had instantly flown over to him. After that, he swung it at Yang Xu.

Crack!

Yang Xu’s soul shuddered while his face warped.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye swung the whip again, but it descended upon Yang Yan this time.

“AH!” Yang Yan wasn’t as strong as Yang Xu, and he immediately let out a shrill cry.

However, Yang Ye didn’t stop. He just swung it repeatedly, and then numerous cracks of the whip resounded along with Yang Yan’s shrill cries.

It was horrible!

Extremely horrible!

Souls were extremely weak things, so the pain from being struck by that Soul Whip was at least ten times greater than being physically whipped.

Yang Yan and Yang Xu’s souls gradually became ethereal.

At this moment, everyone realized that Yang Ye intended to whip them to death!

Suddenly, Yang Xu looked up into the sky and roared with fury, “Even if my family hasn’t contributed any meritorious service over the years, we’ve still contributed hard work. Is the clan that ruthless to the point of refusing to save us?”

No reply came from the sky.

Yang Ye didn’t stop as well, and he just continued swinging the whip.

Yang Xu suddenly smiled miserably and glanced at the surroundings, “See that? Do you see that? This is how the clan treats us! When you’re less useful than someone, it can abandon you at any moment. Regardless of how much you’ve done for the clan! This is the Yang Clan! This is our Yang Clan!”

Silence filled the surroundings.

Meanwhile, an old man in luxurious robes appeared not too far away from Yang Ye. An Nanjing instantly appeared by Yang Ye’s side when she saw the old man. While there was a trace of solemness in her eyes, there was no fear in them at all.

A Half-Step True Realm expert!

Yang Ye paid no attention to the old man, and he just continued whipping them.

Meanwhile, Yang Xu became excited when he saw the old man, “Marshal Lang, out of consideration for the fact that I’ve followed you for a few hundred years, please… please save my grandson!”

The old man was one of the 72 marshals, Marshal Yang Lang. He was ranked at the third position amongst them!

Yang Lang gazed at Yang Xu and shook his head, “I told you to never act rashly before gaining a full understanding of your enemy’s ability. Because the enemy’s strength might far surpass your expectations.”

Yang Xu shook his head slightly, “It’s too late to say that.” He had underestimated Yang Ye’s strength. In the beginning, he felt that no matter how monstrous Yang Ye was, Yang Ye was just a Rebirth Realm cultivator. But he was a senior Zenith Realm expert, and he had ten other Zenith Realm experts under his command. As far as he was concerned, such a force was absolutely sufficient to annihilate Yang Ye if Yang Ye showed himself!

But he was wrong!

A single mistake caused him to lose the battle!

Yang Lang nodded slightly, and then he gazed at Yang Ye, “Can you let them go?”

Yang Ye stopped, turned to look at Yang Lang, and said, “No.”

Yang Lang nodded slightly, “You’re an extraordinary genius, so I don’t want to become enemies with you as well. However, Yang Xu is my subordinate, so I can’t just watch without doing anything. But if I do something, I’ll stop at nothing to kill you.”

He looked up into the sky while he spoke.

Obviously, he was saying that for Yang Gu and Yang Ceng to hear.

A moment of silence ensued before the sky trembled slightly, and then Yang Gu and Yang Ceng appeared here.

Yang Gu glanced at Yang Lang, “I didn’t expect you to come yourself.”

Yang Lang spoke indifferently, “This subordinate of mine would be dead if I didn’t.”

Yang Gu glanced at Yang Xu and Yang Yan, “They brought this upon themselves.”

If Yang Ye had tried to kill them first, then the Discipline Hall would have acted against Yang Ye. Unfortunately, Yang Ye wasn’t the one who launched the first attack, and it was Yang Xu and Yang Yan. However, they’d underestimated Yang Ye’s strength and were taken captive instead!

They’d brought it upon themselves!

They’d courted death!

Yang Lang nodded slightly, “I know. However, I’m sure you’re aware that I can’t just watch as they die. So?”

Yang Gu fell silent for an instant and gazed at Yang Ye, “Stop it here, alright?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “No.”

The atmosphere here instantly became tense.

Yang Gu remained silent for a moment before he said, “It’s time to put it to an end.”

Yang Ye stopped swinging the whip and gazed at Yang Gu, “Why didn’t anyone step forward and ask Yang Xu and Yang Yan to stop when they were torturing my friend? Why didn’t anyone step forward and tell Yang Xu and Yang Yan to stop when they wanted to torture and kill me? Why?”

Yang Gu fell silent for a long time before he said, “Stopping is for your own good. Understand?”

Yang Ye gazed at Yang Gu, “Seniors, are you from the Council of Elders?”

Yang Gu nodded.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye added, “Why don’t you just don’t interfere like the Discipline Hall. Alright?”

Yang Gu’s eyes narrowed slightly, “What do you want to do?”

Yang Ye turned to look at Yang Xu and Yang Yan, “I want to kill them. Anyone who stops me is my enemy. Even if I can’t kill that person now, I guarantee I’ll definitely kill that person in the future. I definitely will!”

Meanwhile, Yang Gu suddenly asked, “What if we insist on stopping you?”

Yang Ye chuckled, and then he gazed at An Nanjing, “Let’s go.”

As he spoke, he tossed the whip to the ground, turned around, and walked away. An Nanjing and Lu Lige immediately followed him as well.

Just like that, they started walking off towards the distance.

Yang Gu and Yang Ceng exchanged glances, and then Yang Gu gazed at Yang Ye, “We won’t interfere anymore.”

They were compromising!

They had to!

Because if they didn’t, then Yang Ye would leave the Yang Clan. Even if he didn’t leave, based on his character, he would definitely hold a grudge towards the Council of Elders. Even though Yang Ye couldn’t fight the Council of Elders now, what about in the future?

Once he attained the Zenith Realm, there would probably be no one in the Council of Elders who would be a match for him.

Simply speaking, the Council of Elders didn’t want to incur this enmity!

Yang Ye stopped, and then he turned to look at Yang Gu. Meanwhile, Yang Gu said, “Since you want to deal with it on your own, then do it. However, you’ll have to bear the consequences yourself.”

He gazed at Yang Lang and said, “You too.” Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Yang Gu and Yang Ceng vanished on the spot once he finished speaking.

Yang Lang nodded slightly, and then he gazed at Yang Ye. A moment later, he withdrew a golden talisman and crushed it. In an instant, a ray of golden light shot up into the air. In an instant, ten rays of golden light shot up into the air from within the city, and then ten spear-wielding men in golden armor appeared behind him.

All of them were at the Zenith Realm!

They bowed slightly to Yang Lang and spoke in unison, “Marshal! The Golden Spear Unit is ready for your orders!”

At the same time, ten green armored men with bows on their backs appeared on the city walls.

They were all at the Zenith Realm too!

They bowed to Yang Lang and spoke in unison, “Marshal! The Green Armor Unit awaits your orders!”

Clip-clop!

Meanwhile, the sound of horse hooves resounded abruptly, and then three men in black armor who rode demon beasts which looked like horses had leaped out from the city. In the end, they stopped behind Yang Lang.

They bowed to Yang Lang, “Marshal! The Mounted Unit is ready to execute your orders!”

23 warriors!

The top three of the seven marshals had the authority to use the 72 warriors, but they could only use a third at once!

Yang Lang gazed at Yang Ye, “Didn’t you want to fight?”

Yang Ye glanced at An Nanjing, “Are you afraid?”

A moment of silence ensued, and then An Nanjing gestured with her right hand.

Swish!

Skyplit shot out of the city wall and entered her grasp.

An Nanjing placed her left hand behind her back and held Skysplit in her right grasp. She glanced at Yang Lang’s group, and then she gazed at Yang Ye and asked, “Do you want them dead or alive?”
