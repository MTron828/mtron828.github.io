Chapter 2265 – Don’t Disturb Me!

These explosions continued for almost two hours!

It was a huge amount of time that they’d bought for Yang Ye and An Nanjing.

At this moment, An Nanjing had recovered by almost 90% with the help of Yang Ye’s Primordial Violet Energy. As for Yang Ye, while he wasn’t fully healed, he was in a much, much better state. But he was still extremely weak, and he had less than 30% of his full strength.

Meanwhile, the surroundings were gradually calming down.

Master Tian and the Undead Warriors were still there.

However, Master Tian’s body gradually turned ethereal before Yang Ye and An Nanjing, and he vanished completely in the end.

If the Universe Sprite hadn’t detonated herself earlier, perhaps Master Tian would have been able to resist these explosions. However, he’d been heavily injured by the Universe Sprite, so how could he resist the self-detonation of so many experts?

Master Tian had vanished, but the nine Undead Warriors were still alive.

All nine of them were supporting themselves with their sabers. Obviously, they were severely injured.

Their strength could be described as extremely terrifying as they’d been able to survive from those explosions.

It could be said that if Yang Ye didn’t use his Sword Domain, then it would be very difficult for him to kill any one of them in single combat!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye stood up slowly and took An Nanjing’s hand, “Let’s go!”

They turned around and walked away.

The nine Undead Warriors didn’t try to stop them.

While Yang Ye and An Nanjing weren’t in very good states themselves, the Undead Warriors were in even worse states.

If they fought Yang Ye and An Nanjing now, there would only be a single outcome. Both sides would perish together.

Once Yang Ye and An Nanjing left, the nine of them sat cross-legged on the ground and were about to start recuperating.

However, a phantom suddenly appeared here. The nine of them reacted very quickly. They instantly converged together and swung their sabers.

Hiss!

Nine rays of saber energy flashed.

At this moment, their saber energy was much weaker than it had been, but it still wasn’t weak. However, the phantom ignored their saber energy and just flashed through space.

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!

In an instant, four heads just suddenly flew up into the air!

Instant annihilation!

Four Undead Warriors had been killed with a single attack.

The phantom planned to attack again, but a pitch black finger suddenly emerged from within space, and it instantly descended from above the phantom.

Meanwhile, the phantom’s figure shook and vanished.

The finger hit nothing but air!

“Retreat!” A voice resounded.

It belonged to the patriarch of the undying race, Feng Yihan!

The five remaining Undead Warriors bowed toward the sky and vanished on the spot.

Meanwhile, in the battlefield down below, only around 300 of the 600 undying cavalries remained. As for the spirits of the void spirit race, all of them had vanished!

The undying cavalry had won the battle!

Once they heard Feng Yihan’s voice, Dugu Juetian, leader of the undying cavalry, immediately led them away.

The space where Void Spirit Continent used to be fell completely silent once more.

However, the battle far away in space was still going on.

…

Yang Ye and An Nanjing entered the boundless reaches of space and traveled to the endless black holes. However, as soon as they arrived there, a phantom suddenly flashed before them.

An Nanjing’s expression changed, and she slammed her spear down.

Bang!

An Nanjing was blasted away with her spear. A moment later, Yang Ye felt coldness strike his neck, and it shocked him. He was about to activate the Sword Domain when a muffled explosion resounded.

An instant later, the phantom was over 3km away.

Suddenly, another ray of dark light descended upon the phantom.

Bang!

That expanse of space exploded apart and was obliterated, but the phantom had vanished.

Yang Ye looked up at space. Obviously, Tian Xiu had helped him. He was about to speak when Tian Xiu’s voice suddenly resounded in his head, “Be careful!”

Be careful!

Yang Ye frowned slightly, and he fell silent for a moment before going over to An Nanjing’s side, and the latter spoke solemnly, “What was that?”

Yang Ye shook his head slightly, “I don’t know. However, it was clearly not someone from the undying race.”

An Nanjing nodded. If it was an expert of the undying race, they would be dead. Obviously, it wasn’t someone from the undying race.

So, they had a new problem.

Who was that?

Who in this world possessed such strength?

Yang Ye shook his head and restrained his thoughts, “Forget that person. Let’s go!”

Yang Ye led An Nanjing to the door of light that led to the undying race, and then they entered it.

The undying race!

It didn’t take long for them to arrive in the homeworld of the undying race. At this moment, it was deathly silent and without even a trace of spirit energy. The large universe had been destroyed, and so had this place.

Yang Ye closed his eyes and released his divine sense. It only took a moment for him to finish scanning the surroundings.

A short while later, Yang Ye looked toward the side, “That way! Let’s go!”

They were about to leave once he finished speaking, they suddenly looked toward the side. A group was shooting over rapidly.

They were led by the five Undead Warriors, and the remaining undying cavalry and Dugu Juetian were behind them.

Yang Ye clenched his fists slowly. However, Dugu Juetian’s group didn’t attack them. They just shot off toward the side, and there was a slightly solemn expression on their faces.

Dugu Juetian glanced at Yang Ye when they passed by, and her eyes had ghastly killing intent in them. But she didn’t attack!

It didn’t take long for them to vanish from Yang Ye and An Nanjing’s fields of vision.

Yang Ye spoke solemnly, “What’s going on?”

An Nanjing shook her head slightly, “They seem like they’re in a hurry, and only five of those nine Undead Warriors are left.”

Yang Ye was about to speak when he suddenly looked to the side. A phantom was flickering incessantly like a ghost over 3km away!

An Nanjing and Yang Ye seemed to have thought of something, and their faces gradually turned solemn.

It was the same phantom which had attacked them just now. Based on the current situation, the phantom had pursued the experts of the undying race all the way here!

Yang Ye and An Nanjing exchanged glances, and both of them were extremely shocked!

Yang Ye fell silent for quite some time before he said, “Forget it! Let’s go!”

He led An Nanjing into the distance. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Meanwhile, the phantom didn’t go afar Yang Ye and An Nanjing, and it just floated there before vanishing after some time passed.

Yang Ye and An Nanjing arrived at an underground pavilion. It was a gloomy and extremely dark pavilion.

The Tomb of Gods!

It was the place where the undying race imprisoned the peak experts from all the races it had conquered.

Yang Ye’s objective was to look for Yang Wudi.

Previously, this place was guarded by the experts of the undying race, and it was even the Undead Warriors who were in charge of it. Yet now, no one was guarding it anymore. So, they got in with absolute ease.

The two of them went forward all the way, and it didn’t take long for them to suddenly stop. There was a translucent casket on their left, and a middle aged man laid within it. The middle aged man had a peaceful expression like he was sleeping.

The man wasn’t Yang Wudi, and the only reason Yang Ye had stopped was that he sensed sword intent from the man. Moreover, the man had a sword in his arms.

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and walked over to it. There were some words atop the casket—Immortal Undertaker, the patriarch of the immortal spirit race. Possesses godly attainments in the Sword Dao and capable of slaughtering immortals with a single swing.

Godly!

Yang Ye frowned when he saw that. Few were able to be worthy of such a word, and at the very least, he still couldn’t!

Yang Ye withdrew his gaze and looked toward the other side. There was another casket there, and a woman laid within it. Similarly, there were words atop the casket—Fen Tianyin, guardian of the southern melody race. With a zither in hand, her music can annihilate all Daos!

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings, and he saw a few more caskets. All of them had introductions on them.

Yang Ye had a rough guess toward their strengths at this point.

They were probably at the True Dao Realm. As for their combat strength, perhaps they were merely inferior to the patriarch of the undying race and Void Spirit Maiden when both of them were at their prime. As for the gap between them, it was absolutely not huge. They were the peal experts of other universes!

Of course, the most terrifying was the undying race!

The undying race had conquered too many universes, and after Yang Ye came into contact with them, he’d gained a deep understanding of how strong they were. Moreover, he wasn’t even facing them at their prime.

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts and shook his head, “Let’s go!”

An Nanjing and him continued forward. It didn’t take long for them to stop simultaneously. There was a casket not too far away from them, and a person was lying within it. It was Yang Wudi!

Yang Ye took a deep breath and walked over with An Nanjing. He placed his right hand on the lid and circulated his profound energy. It didn’t take long for the casket to turn ethereal.

“There’s death energy within him!” Meanwhile, An Nanjing spoke abruptly, “The death energy fills him, and it has put him in a state of suspended animation!”

Yang Ye nodded, and then he placed his right palm on Yang Wudi’s chest. After that, Primordial Violet Energy surged incessantly into Yang Wudi’s body.

Primordial Violet Energy could be said to be the counter of death energy. Without it, Yang Ye would really be helpless against the death energy within Yang Wudi!

Just like that, the death energy within Yang Wudi was gradually disintegrated by the Primordial Violet Energy.

A long time passed before the death energy had been cleared completely, but Yang Wudi didn’t wake up!

“What’s going on?” Yang Ye gazed at An Nanjing. The latter frowned and didn’t know what was wrong either.

Suddenly, An Nanjing said, “Look at his chest!”

Yang Ye looked over, and he noticed a letter on Yang Wudi’s chest. At this moment, it floated out slowly.

Yang Ye opened it, and he was stunned on the spot when he read it.

The words in the letter read:

“Don’t disturb me! I’m with your mother!”
