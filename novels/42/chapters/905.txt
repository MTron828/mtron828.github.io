Chapter 906 – Someone Called The Unfettered One!

After the ball of light dispersed, Yang Ye and the beautiful woman had appeared before everyone. At this moment, Yang Ye was standing in front of her, and his hand was wrapped around her throat.

The surroundings were deathly silent!

She gazed at him while only shock remained in her eyes.

“Instructor Shang!” The inner court students were shocked when they witnessed this scene, and they shot towards Yang Ye.

“Fuck off!” Yang Ye glanced coldly at them, and all of them immediately stopped out of fear towards him. None of them dared to take a step forward while they looked at Yang Ye who had a slightly ferocious expression on his face.

Meanwhile, the woman suddenly said, “I know who you are now!”

Yang Ye laughed coldly, “So what if you do?”

She glanced at him with a slightly complicated gaze and said, “I know why he chose you. Besides your strength, your ruthlessness and fortitude are reasons as well. Indeed, only someone who possesses your strength and character might have a chance to tear open a path in the Central Divine Prefecture that’s filled with geniuses!”

Yang Ye suddenly said, “You think I wouldn’t dare to kill you?”

She replied, “Would you?”

Yang Ye revealed a slight smile on the corners of his mouth while he squeezed down slowly. However, it didn’t take long for Yang Ye to frown because an invisible force had suddenly appeared around her neck, and it dispersed his strength.

It was the energy of a Saint!

Yang Ye nodded and said, “So you have the protection of a Saint. No wonder you are so fearless. However, that Saint’s energy seems to only show itself when you suffer a threat to your life. In other words, while I can’t kill you, I can beat you up!”

When he spoke up to this point, Yang Ye held her by the throat as he slammed her against the ground.

Bang!

The ground cracked apart while countless stones shot towards the surroundings!

Yang Ye didn’t stop. His hand moved down and grabbed one of her legs, and then he started smashing her against the ground....

Bang! Bang! Bang!

In next to no time, there were numerous craters all around Yang Ye.

Just like that, around 15 minutes passed before Yang Ye stopped. She was still alive, of course. She was a high rank Half-Saint at any rate, so even if she didn’t cultivate her body intentionally, it would still be stronger than an ordinary demon beast at the Half-Saint Realm. But while she hadn’t died, it was absolutely worse than death for her!

Yang Ye naturally wasn’t interested in paying any attention to whether she was suffering. He just kicked her stomach, and her figure was dragged against the ground as it flew over 3km away!

As soon as he was done, his figure flashed over to Liu Nan and grabbed Liu Nan by the throat. He lifted Liu Nan up and said, “Now, no one can protect you.”

Suddenly, the sky trembled, and then a howl of pain resounded. After that, the demon beasts that were attacking the city walls like they’d gone mad raised their heads and let out sorrowful howls.

In next to no time, the pack of wolves grew even more frenzied, and all of them madly attacked the city as if they were ready to lose their lives in the process.

The city’s defenses that were quite solid just moments ago started to crack open before the army of wolves that smashed successively against the city walls.

Meanwhile, 7 old men appeared not too far away from Yang Ye.

All of them were Saints!

However, their auras weren’t very stable while their countenances were quite pale. Obviously, they were injured.

“De... Dean....” Liu Nan saw hope once again when he saw those 7 old men.

Yang Ye looked along Liu Nan’s gaze, and the gaze of an old man whose beard was practically touching the ground had descended onto him as well. Yang Ye knew that the old man was the dean because the old man’s aura was the strongest amongst their group of 7!

The dean said, “You really aren’t someone who can avoid causing trouble!”

Crack!

Yang Ye squeezed down slightly, and Liu Nan’s neck was instantly broken. As for Liu Nan, his eyes had opened wide at the moment of his death, and he gazed at Yang Ye with disbelief. He’d truly never imagined that Yang Ye would actually dare to kill him before the dean and 6 other Saints!

Yang Ye was very well aware that he might not have a chance to kill Liu Nan if he didn’t kill him right now. So, he struck first!

The 6 Saints and even the dean frowned upon witnessing this scene.

“Such character.... It’s fine even to reject him!” One of the Saints spoke abruptly.

“Bold but foolish, and he acts so ruthlessly and goes to such extremes. He isn’t worthy of being an instructor!” said another old man.

“The academy will never be peaceful with him around!”

Leng Yuran and the others’ expressions changed when they heard the evaluations of those Saint Realm experts, and worry appeared in their eyes again. After all, these old men were the supreme experts of the academy, so wouldn’t their disapproval of Yang Ye represent that Yang Ye would be dismissed?

The dean gazed at Yang Ye for a short while before he said, “Do you know that if you exercised a little forbearance, then not only would you obtain what you wanted, you would even become someone who had rendered meritorious service to the academy and be rewarded by the academy. But now, not only have you lost it all because of your willfulness and impulsiveness, you’ll even have to pay a price that you shouldn’t have!”

Yang Ye shook his head and said, “Old man, I know that I went a little too far this time, but I don’t think that I did anything wrong. You consider the lives of the inner court students as valuable, but aren’t the lives of the outer court students valuable as well? He arbitrarily ordered the city gates to be closed and denied us entry into the city. Such actions are undoubtedly like trampling upon the lives of my students of the outer court. However, not only did the Disciple Elder have no intention of punishing him, that fellow even wanted to play the matter down and let it pass.”

When he spoke up to this point, Yang Ye pointed at the students of the inner court and said, “Earlier, all of these fellows were clearly aware that I’m the instructor of the outer court, yet they still obeyed Liu Nan’s orders to kill me. So are they not at fault? At this moment, the only reason all of you think that I went too far is because they were weak, and all of you are pitying the weak. However, did all of you think about what would have happened? If I didn’t possess some strength, then how horrifying would the fate that awaited them be?”

“They were at fault, but they didn’t deserve death!” One of the old men spoke solemnly, “Moreover, even if they’d committed a crime, it should be my Discipline Department that deals with them instead of you punishing them on your own.”

Another old man spoke coldly, “Slaughtering students as an instructor is an offense that deserves death!”

“Wouldn’t those students have died for nothing if we don’t kill him?” Another old man said, “I suggest that the dean should immediately sentence him to death and give justice to those fallen students!”

The dean gazed at Yang Ye and said, “While those inner court students and Liu Nan were at fault, they didn’t deserve death. You’ve broken the rules of the academy by killing them, so you should be sentenced to death right away. However, out of consideration for the fact that you brought the outer court students back, you can avoid death but can’t escape punishment. From this moment onwards, you’re no long the instructor of the outer court, and you’re sentenced to facing a wall and repenting for 100 years!”

Yang Ye’s eyelids twitched when he heard this. He didn’t care about losing his position as an instructor, but face a wall and repent for 100 years? What a joke! Not to mention a hundred, he wasn’t even willing to do it for a year!

Right when he was about to object, the dean didn’t give him the slightest chance and waved his right hand. An invisible restrictive force locked down onto Yang Ye, causing him to be unable to move, and then his vision warped before he vanished into thin air.

One of the old men gazed at the dean and spoke, “Aren’t you letting him off a little too lightly with just that much of punishment?”

The other Saints gazed at the dean as well. After all, Yang Ye had only been dismissed and sentenced to repenting before a wall. Needless to say, it wasn’t much punishment at all!

The dean shook his head and said, “He’s a disciple of the Ancient Sword School. Do you think that old fellow, Jian Wuchen, would let us kill him? Of course, we can kill him first before letting Jian Wuchen know. But at that time, it wouldn’t just be a few inner court students who lose their lives. Don’t even think that I’m just scaring all of you. It isn’t just the founding ancestor of the Ancient Sword School who thinks highly of him, even that old bastard of the Dao Order thinks highly of him. We can punish him. But trust me, if we kill him, then those 2 old fellows would immediately come looking for trouble with us!” Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

One of the old men said, “He’s that fellow, Yang Ye, who challenged the Dao Order on his own and caused it to be utterly humiliated?”

The dean nodded while a trace of bitterness could be seen on the corners of his mouth, “In the beginning, Jian Wuchen, told me that he was a source of disaster, but I didn’t really believe Jian Wuchen. Now, I have no choice but to believe him. That fellow’s character.... Tsk, tsk. It’s truly horrible!”

One of the other Saints said, “You intend to make him participate represent our academy in White Deer Academy’s competition?”

The gazes of the other old men descended onto the dean.

The dean nodded, “What do all of you think?”

After a moment of silence, one of the old men said, “He’s unyielding, ruthless, and bold enough. Just his strength is slightly insufficient! But that’s fine because it can be improved!”

The others nodded with agreement.

“I feel that we should first think about how to deal with the situation before us!” One of the old men spoke abruptly, “While the Demon King is heavily injured, we’re heavily injured as well. Of course, we naturally wouldn’t have to fear him if we were only up against Welkin Wolf Mountain Range. However, this incident isn’t that simple!”

“It really isn’t!” A cold glow flashed through the dean’s eyes!

...

On the peak of a mountain.

There was a mountain wall standing before Yang Ye, and there was a painting on it.

Yang Ye stared fixedly at the painting while there was a bewildered and dazed glow in his eyes.

A voice suddenly resounded from behind Yang Ye, “Your sword intent will attain the Void Rank if you’re able to comprehend that painting’s secrets!”

It was the dean of Ocean of Clouds Academy!

A long time passed before Yang Ye spoke, “Who made this painting?”

“Someone called the Unfettered One!” The dean’s voice carried a trace of incomprehensible emotion.
