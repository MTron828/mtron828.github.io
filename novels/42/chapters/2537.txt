Chapter 2538 – It’s Not Your Fault!

Please fuck off!

Yang Ye’s voice resounded through the hall and carried no emotion at all!

Elder Xue looked him in the eye, “Do you think this is good for the sect?”

As she spoke, she glanced at the disciples of the sect, “How will our sect fight against the Soul Sect? How will we fight the other powers outside the West Region? Are we really going to allow the sect to vanish from history?”

Meanwhile, Gu Nan suddenly sighed softly, “A’Xue, you’re doing this for the sake of the sect too, but have you thought about what the other powers would think of us once we submit to the Soul Sect? Our ancestors and seniors won’t be able to rest in peace within their graves!”

Elder Xue laughed coldly, “At least we’ll still have a chance to rise up again! Yet now…”

She pointed at Yang Ye, “He’s only at the Three World Realm. While he has the strength to kill Lord Realm experts, can he kill experts above the Lord Realm? If you stay with him, the consequence will be suffering a horrible death, and you’ll never have another chance to rise up again.”

Gu Nan wanted to say something else, but Yang Ye walked over to Elder Xue, “Elder Xue, I want to ask you something. Does your confidence come from the previous sect master? So, once he’s dead, you’ve lost all your confidence in the Ancient Sword Sect?”

Elder Xue gazed at Yang Ye, “You’re too young. The Ancient Sword Sect isn’t being targeted by the Soul Sect alone, the other powers cover the sect too. The previous sect master forcefully kept himself alive for many years in the hopes that someone in the sect would be able to surpass the Lord Realm. Unfortunately, he was disappointed. No one in our sect accomplished it throughout the years!”

Yang Ye asked, “So you think the sect is beyond saving?”

Elder Xue gazed at Yang Ye and remained silent.

Yang Ye shook his head, “Elder Xue, I’m only willing to stand here and talk to you because I can sense that you may have really sided with the Soul Sect for the Ancient Sword Sect’s sake. However, have you thought about the fact that we are sword cultivators? We’re sword cultivators!”T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings, “We cultivate the sword. If we really surrender for our survival, then will our sword still have backbone? Will it have dignity? A sword without backbone and dignity can never be sharp!”

Elder Xue refuted, “Backbone? Dignity? But have you thought of their lives?”

Yang Ye suddenly gazed at the disciples of the sect, “Answer me! Would you rather die on your feet or live on your knees?”

“Die on our feet!” Countless disciples shouted loudly like thunderclaps that resounded through the sect!

Elder Xue turned slightly pale.

The other elders’ faces were quite unsightly too!

Yang Ye returned to his seat, “Elder Xue, Grand Elder, and all of you who have joined the Soul Sect, including the disciples down below… Everyone has their own choice, and I won’t force you to make the same choice as me. Now, all of you can leave safely, and we won’t stop you. But we won’t show any mercy when we meet again!”

The hall fell into silence!

Leave!

Gu Nan hesitated to speak.

Obviously, once Elder Xue and the others left, the sect would grow even weaker. After all, Elder Xue and the others were the backbone of the sect! Once they left, the Ancient Sword Sect wouldn’t just be in a terrible situation, it would be in a hopeless situation!

Elder Xue gazed at Yang Ye for a long time and said, “I feel slightly regretful now.”

She turned around and left with the other elders.

It didn’t take long for everyone in the hall to leave, and only Yang Ye, Gu Nan, and Sword Scroll, who just showed herself, remained in the hall!

Gu Nan glanced at Sword Scroll, bowed slightly, and didn’t say a word.

Sword Scroll’s status in the sect wasn’t any inferior to a sect master!

She was a Super Divine Treasure who’d made countless contributions to the sect!

Sword Scroll walked over to Yang Ye, “I shouldn’t have asked you to take over!”

Yang Ye shook his head, “I had my own considerations too. I agreed because I felt I could take control of the sect and make it a powerful source of support for myself. Unfortunately, I didn’t expect it to be so complicated!”

Sword Scroll was hesitant to say something!

Yang Ye smiled, “Don’t worry. Since I’ve chosen to do this, I’ll do it well.”

She spoke softly, “Do you have any plans?”

Yang Ye nodded slightly, “I have my own backing as well!”

Sword Scroll seemed to have thought of something, and the worry on her face vanished!

There really were few in the world who possessed backing that was stronger than Yang Ye!

Yang Ye gazed at Gu Nan, “Senior Gu Nan, I need you to help me manage the sect’s affairs from now on.”

Gu Nan glanced at Yang Ye and nodded, “Alright!”

Yang Ye gazed at Sword Scroll, “You take control of the sect’s information infrastructure. I need to know what I want to know.”

She nodded slightly, “Understood!”

She turned around and left.

Gu Nan left too.

Only Yang Ye remained in the hall.

Yang Ye glanced at the sky outside, “I need to get some help!”

A short while later, he left the Ancient Sword Sect.

He concealed his departure so no one was aware of it.

This time, he went to the underground trade area in the War Dimension again.

In the small dark house, he met the same mysterious figure.

Yang Ye flicked a fruit over to the figure. It was a Chaotic Fruit.

Yang Ye said, “You can help me find a few people, right?”

The figure replied, “Tell me about them!”

Yang Ye quickly spoke a list of names.

A long time passed before the figure said, “You’ll have to pay extra if some of them aren’t in Eternal Kingdom!”

Yang Ye nodded, “Alright!”

The figure asked, “What should we do upon locating them?”

Yang Ye smiled, “Tell them to come see me at the Ancient Sword Sect!”

The figure nodded slightly, “Sure.”

Yang Ye turned around and was about to leave when the figure suddenly said, “I have an offer you might be interested in.”

Yang Ye stopped and gazed at the figure.

The figure said, “I received news that you went to that abyss with the eldest young miss of the Xing Clan!”

Yang Ye frowned slightly, “You’re targeting that abyss?”

The figure shook its head, “How could we dare to do that?”

How could they dare!

Yang Ye glanced at the mysterious figure, “Do you know what lies beneath it?”

The figure shook its head again, “It’s a mysterious place, and it’s one of the few places in the world that we cannot step foot into. You’ve been there and survived to come back. We want you to make another trip there, and in return, we…”

Yang Ye suddenly shook his head, “Sorry, I refuse!”

Yang Ye vanished on the spot.

The black robed figure sighed softly, and then it vanished on the spot as well.

Yang Ye left the house. Go to the abyss? That was an absolute joke! He wasn’t tired of living! Just thinking about how he’d been able to escape that day filled him with a lingering fear. It was an absolutely dangerous place!

Once he left the area, Yang Ye left the War Dimension and returned to the Ancient Sword Sect.

At this moment, all the disciples of the sect had returned to the sect as he’d ordered.

Moreover, he allowed the sect’s subordinate clans and organizations to come take shelter in the sect too.

Once Sword Scroll took control of the sect’s information networks, it didn’t take long for him to locate traces of the Soul Sect.

A short while later, Yang Ye and the other 9 disciples from that day left the sect without anyone noticing.

Once they left the sect, Sword Scroll went to the Sword Cave on her own.

She went to the deepest parts of it, and there was a room there. In the room was a single green cushion, and on the cushion was a piece of wood. Or to be more precise, it was a piece of Soul Wood!

Sword Scroll walked over to the cushion and picked up the wood. She gazed at it for a long time before she left the room with it.

…

At this moment, the West Region seemed quite strange. The residents of countless cities had just vanished inexplicably, and it caused the West Region to seem like only the Ancient Sword Sect remained here!

As for what was going on in the West Region, the other regions of Eternal Kingdom didn’t show any response!

On this day, Yang Ye led the other 9 disciples to an ancient city, and terrified voices frequently resounded from it!

Qing Yue spoke solemnly, “We aren’t too late!”

Yang Ye nodded, “Be careful!”

Qing Yue and the others nodded, and then they shot into the city. At this moment, some black robed figures were madly extracting the souls of the city’s residents!

They were being extracted alive!

Once Qing Yue and the others entered the city, sword howls resounded incessantly.

“How dare you!” Suddenly, a furious shout resounded from the distant sky, and then a pitch black hand stretched out from there and clawed at Qing Yue’s group.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye looked up at the hand, and then a flying sword shot at it!

Hiss!

The hand was instantly sliced into two!

An astounded voice came from the sky, “You… So fast…”

As soon as the voice finished resounding, a block robed old man appeared in the sky above the city. The old man stared at Yang Ye, “You’re the new sect master of the Ancient Sword Sect!”

Yang Ye nodded, “I am!”

The old man laughed coldly, “I heard you just took the position of sect master!”

Yang Ye nodded again, “You’re right. Do you have something to say about it?”

A wisp of ridicule curled up on the old man’s lips, “I bet you won’t last a month. Want to make that bet?”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and replied, “I bet you’re about to lose your head. Want to make that bet?”

The old man’s eyes narrowed slightly, “I heard you have the strength to kill Lord Realm experts, but I don’t really believe that. Come on! I’m not at the Lord Realm yet, I’m just at the peak of the Five World Realm. Let me see if you really…”

Suddenly, the Sword Gourd trembled by Yang Ye’s waist, and then a flying sword shot off into the sky!

The black robed man’s voice stopped abruptly!

The old man stared at Yang Ye while disbelief filled his eyes.

A cut gradually split open on his throat, and it grew larger and larger…

Yang Ye gazed at the black robed old man and said, “The Five World Realm is so weak… No, wait. It isn’t your fault. I’m too strong.”
