Chapter 2209 – Shut Up!

It was a continent with a name that was unknown to him. He was only here because the undying race had slaughtered the entire continent.

Blood had formed rivers throughout the continent!

It was hell on earth!

Even though it was truly hell on earth here, it was quite helpful to Yang Ye.

Absorb!

He stood on the ground like an old monk in meditation.

The endless slaughter intent, hatred, blood, and resentment in the surroundings surged toward him like a torrent.

The blood red glow around Yang Ye gradually became darker and darker.

In the beginning, the glow around him was blood red; now, it was dark red.

Two weeks later.

At this moment, Yang Ye had absorbed all the slaughter intent, blood, hatred, and resentment on the entire continent.

Suddenly, Yang Ye opened his eyes.

Hiss! Hiss!

Two rays of blood red light surged out from his eyes. Everywhere they passed, space was torn open, and two extremely long spatial rifts appeared before him until the end of his vision.

Yang Ye’s eyes were blood red like an ocean of blood.

He had no eyes, just blood there!

Eyes of blood!

Meanwhile, a sword howl resounded, and then a blood red sword appeared by his side.

The Sword Spirit!

At this moment, the Sword Spirit had undergone a transformation too. Her entire body was dark red like she was made entirely of blood!

Besides that, there was a small black dot on Yang Ye’s forehead!

Resentment and hatred!

He’d sealed the hatred and resentment he absorbed in his forehead. It was too strong, so it may be considered as a side effect to him. Because the resentment and hatred had come along with the slaughter intent and blood, if he absorbed the slaughter intent and blood, then he had to absorb the hatred and resentment. But if the hatred and resentment were allowed to enter his mind, it would absolutely be capable of collapsing his mind!

So, he used the Primordial Pagoda to seal them.

Meanwhile, the Sword Spirit appeared before Yang Ye, “Are you sure it’s alright?”

She was naturally talking about the black dot on his forehead.

Yang Ye grinned, “In the beginning, I was a little worried. But now, if I were to release it in battle, then coupled with my slaughter intent, it would definitely be a beautiful sight to behold!”

She asked softly, “Can you endure it?”

Yang Ye nodded lightly, “I can while I have the Primordial Pagoda!”

The Primordial Pagoda!

It was considered the number one treasure of the large universe, so its abilities were definitely unrivaled. It was exactly why he could resist the hatred and resentment while he had it to protect his mind and heart!

Meanwhile, the Sword Spirit asked, “Are you still going to continue?”

“Of course!” Yang Ye nodded as he glanced at the surroundings. At this moment, there were no living beings left on the continent. First it had lost all spirit energy, then the undying cavalries arrived, so the continent had been utterly transformed into a dead planet.

Yang Ye spoke softly, “The undying race is truly ruthless!”

He was a ruthless person too, but he hadn’t done something like slaughtering an entire continent. But the undying race had! And they’d been so thorough about it!

Moreover, it wasn’t just one continent, this had occurred to many continents!

The Sword Spirit spoke softly, “Perhaps killing to them is like how humans kill animals for food. After all, they live on death energy!”

Yang Ye nodded, “Forget them. Let’s go to the next continent!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye transformed into a ray of blood red light that vanished on the spot.

As for the Sword Spirit, she shot up into the air and followed close behind him.

The Demon Dimension.

Yang Ye and the Sword Spirit arrived at a continent in the Demon Dimension. As soon as he descended there, a strong stench of blood assaulted his nose. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Blood had formed rivers here!

The entire continent was covered in corpses and blood.

Yang Ye shook his head and waved his hands. In an instant, an endless stream of blood and slaughter intent converged toward him from the entire continent. Just like that, five days passed before Yang Ye left and traveled to the next continent.

A month later.

Throughout this month, Yang Ye had absorbed an innumerable amount of slaughter intent and blood. All of them had allowed Yang Ye’s slaughter intent to undergo another qualitative transformation.

It was still Progenitor Realm slaughter intent, but it wasn’t something his old slaughter intent could compare to anymore!

It could be said that if he faced a Sage now, he wouldn’t even need to use his sword. Just his slaughter intent would be sufficient to kill the Sage in an instant!

His current slaughter intent was so strong that even he found it difficult to control!

Even when he had the Primordial Pagoda to help suppress it, he still found it quite difficult to control. It could be said that his current slaughter intent was at his limit.

However, the most terrifying part was the black dot on his forehead.

Too much hatred and resentment was condensed there. So, if it wasn’t for the Primordial Pagoda, Yang Ye would be dead by now. The hatred and resentment was something that even Yang Ye didn’t dare rashly touch.

It was too terrifying!

it could be said that if he released all of it, and if he didn’t have the Primordial Pagoda to help him, he would be obliterated in an instant. Moreover, he wasn’t very confident even if he had the Primordial Pagoda’s help right now.

It was his greatest trump card right now!

Yang Ye closed his eyes slowly, and then the red glow around him dispersed.

Yang Ye spoke softly, “Let’s go!”

The Sword Spirit asked, “Where?”

He looked up at the sky, “To get even!”

He vanished on the spot once he finished speaking, and the Sword Spirit followed behind him.

Far away in the sky, Yang Ye flew swiftly on his sword, and it didn’t take long for him to enter outer space.

A short while later, he arrived at the Dao Dimension.

The Dao Path!

On this day, the space above the Dao Dimension turned blood red, and boundless blood enveloped the Dao Dimension.

Everyone within it was shocked!

A moment later, an old man appeared before Yang Ye.

Dao Qing!

The same Dao Qing who’d welcomed Yang Ye in the past, the Dao Progenitor’s eldest disciple.

Dao Qing spoke solemnly, “Yang Ye, what do you want?”

“What do I want?” Yang Ye gazed at Dao Qing.

Dao Qing’s expression changed slightly when he saw the ocean of blood in Yang Ye’s eyes, and he couldn’t help but take a step back.

Terror!

Dao Qing saw a force that horrified him within those eyes!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye closed his eyes. He ignored Dao Qing and looked down at the Dao Dimension below, “The ancestors of the Buddhist Path and Weapon Path, are you going to show yourselves, or should I bring you outside myself?”

He was naturally here for them!

There were debts that he naturally had to retake for himself!

Meanwhile, Dao Qing suddenly said, “Yang Ye, they are part of the World Alliance now…”

Suddenly, a sword howl resounded, and then a sword pressed against Dao Qing’s forehead.

Dao Qing’s voice stopped abruptly!

Yang Ye gazed at Dao Qing, “Just shut up! You have no right to speak here!”

Dao Qing’s face instantly turned unsightly.

However, he didn’t dare to say anything.

The strength of the person before him was far beyond anything he could resist. Most importantly, this fellow before him was a god of death.

Yang Ye gazed at the Dao Dimension, “So you refuse to show yourselves?”

As soon as he finished speaking, he raised his hands slightly. In an instant, a wave of invisible slaughter intent enveloped the Dao Dimension. If it descended upon the Dao Dimension, it would undoubtedly be a disaster for the Dao Dimension.

Because not to mention ordinary cultivators, even a Sage couldn’t endure Yang Ye’s slaughter intent now!

Suddenly, a ray of gold light appeared near Yang Ye, and it dispersed to reveal a golden lotus. The Buddhist Progenitor was on the lotus.

The Buddhist Progenitor had quite a complicated expression on his face as he gazed at Yang Ye.

This young man before him had grown to a level that made even him incapable of doing anything to the young man.

The Buddhist Progenitor pressed his palms together, “Young Master Yang, it’s been a while!”

Yang Ye raised his sword and swung it!

A sword howl resounded, and a ray of blood red sword energy tore through space toward the Buddhist Progenitor.

The latter’s eyes narrowed slightly, and then he pushed his right palm forward.

Bang!

Yang Ye’s sword energy was stopped by the Buddhist Progenitor’s palm. Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly appeared above the Buddhist Progenitor, and then he grabbed his sword with both hands and slammed it down.

The Buddhist Progenitor looked up and slammed his palm upward.

Boom!

Yang Ye was blasted away with his sword, but it only took a moment for him to suddenly appear behind the Buddhist Progenitor. A moment later, a sword pressed down against the Buddhist Progenitor’s back, but a ray of golden light suddenly surged out from the latter.

Bang!

The golden light pushed Yang Ye back while the Buddhist Progenitor was pushed over 3km back with his lotus. As soon as he stopped himself, a sword had arrived just half an inch from his forehead.

The Buddhist Progenitor pressed his palms together to stop Yang Ye’s sword!

Suddenly, Yang Ye appeared behind it, and he kicked its hilt.

Bang!

The sword stabbed forward.

However, the Buddhist Progenitor had vanished.

At the same time, a huge palm suddenly appeared above Yang Ye, and a powerful wave of pressure pushed Yang Ye down incessantly.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye stomped his right foot down and shot up into the air.

Hiss!

His blood red sword sliced open the golden palm. At the same time, countless rays of blood red sword energy shot toward the Buddhist Progenitor.

The Buddhist Progenitor closed his eyes and pressed his palms together.

Bang!

A ray of golden light swept forward, and it obstructed Yang Ye’s sword energy!

Meanwhile, the Buddhist Progenitor opened his eyes, “Your strength isn’t bad, but you’re lacking in experience.”

Yang Ye took a step forward and suddenly opened his eyes. In an instant, two rays of blood red sword energy shot out from his eye sockets.

As soon as they appeared, the space around Yang Ye was minced into bits!

At the same time, a strand of damp and warm energy rippled toward the surroundings.

Blood!

In the area above the Dao Dimension, countless strands of blood had suddenly appeared, and they were ceaselessly dripping down toward the Dao Dimension.
