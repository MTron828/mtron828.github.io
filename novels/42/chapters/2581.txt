Chapter 2582

The desire to fight!

At this moment, Yang Ye’s battle intent was fully revealed. Even if her strength far surpassed his own, he still wanted to fight!

Hot blooded and brainless?

It could be described as that!

At this moment, he’d thought of the consequences! But regardless of the consequences, he had chosen to accept them all. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

At most times, living in humiliation was worse than death!

Because the heart would never overcome it!

It was too aggrieving!

Just like this very moment. She wanted his help, but her attitude was one where she felt he had to help her because he was weak, and he should die if he refused!

They were all human, so why should she be so high and mighty?

Her strength?

So what if she was strong?

Yang Ye refused to accept it.

At this moment, he didn’t think of Tian Xiu or Qi Bitian, he only thought about himself.

He refused to live in humiliation!

Now that he was ready to face death, he was naturally without any fear. Because the worst would be just death.

The sword intent he emanated was endless, but that wasn’t the main point. The main point was that his blood was boiling at this moment.

His bloodline was the Mad Demon Bloodline, and what was its essence?

Madness!

Moreover, the essence of Madness was fearlessness, or to be more precise, the desire to die!

Those who desired death were the maddest!

Yang Ye’s sword intent started to change. The sword intent he emanated soundlessly converged by his side. While it hadn’t advanced, it was completely different from before.

Previously, his sword intent had been slightly dead, yet now, it was sharp and seemed like it could pierce the sky!

Its style was completely different!

Besides that, Yang Ye’s aura had grown stronger because the blood beneath his skin was transforming.

It had truly reversed, but it was obvious that his bloodline had recovered to its original form!

The true Mad Demon Bloodline!

The powerful Mad Demon Bloodline stimulated Yang Ye, causing his aura to grow increasingly stronger… Gradually, with the help of the Mad Demon Bloodline, he advanced from the Five World Realm into the Lord Realm!

Once he attained the Lord Realm, his blood gradually calmed down!

The woman before Yang Ye just watched in silence and hadn’t attacked!

Once he attained the Lord Realm, she spoke, “Is this what you plan to rely on?”

“What I’m relying on?” Yang Ye shook his head and smiled, “I have nothing to rely on.”

As he spoke, he stretched out his hand and made a grasped motion. An intent sword soundlessly condensed in his grasp. At this moment, the intent sword was completely different!

His intent sword was offensive now!

Yang Ye gazed at her, “If you want help, you can talk to me nicely, but if you threaten me, then forgive me for refusing to help.”

She gazed at him for a short while and said, “But I intend to threaten you!”

She suddenly attacked.

She clawed at Yang Ye, and this attack caused the space around Yang Ye to freeze. Meanwhile, Yang Ye couldn’t move, and her hand just suddenly wrapped itself around his throat!

The woman just raised him up like that!

The Lord Realm!

Even if he’d attained the Lord Realm, the gap between them was still huge!

However, Yang Ye didn’t just wait for death to arrive!

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!

Countless intent swords suddenly shot out from the sword intent around Yang Ye. Because they were very close, Yang Ye’s intent swords struck her. But she remained completely unharmed!

For some unknown reason, those swords actually vanished upon touching her!

She looked him in the eyes, “Do you have any other moves to use?”

Meanwhile, a strand of mysterious energy appeared.

The Sword Domain!

Along with that, Yang Ye could move again. In an instant, countless intent swords transformed into rays of light that enveloped her.

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!

The sound of something being sliced resounded incessantly.

This time, the woman wasn’t able to ignore the intent swords when they struck her. It was because they had become completely different upon being enveloped by the Sword Domain. Besides that, a strand of powerful sword intent rippled out from Yang Ye, and it pushed Yang Ye and the woman apart. However, even with the combined force of his sword intent and intent swords, she had merely been pushed less than 30m away!

Moreover, she remained completely unharmed!

Their strength wasn’t on the same level at all!

She glanced at the surroundings, “A Domain?”

She gazed at Yang Ye and slowly raised her right hand.

Hiss!

Gusts of cold wind condensed. Once they appeared within the Sword Domain, Yang Ye felt bone-piercing coldness assault him. It was no wind, it was blades!

Slicing!

The cold wind was ceaselessly slicing Yang Ye’s Sword Domain!

Yang Ye was shocked and hurriedly used his Sword Domain to form numerous intent swords that flashed through the area.

If one looked over here from the world outside the bridge was covered in sword energy and cold winds!

If looked at from the battlefield instead, the cold winds firmly suppressed Yang Ye’s sword energy!

It could be said that if he wasn’t relying on his Sword Domain, these strands of sword energy would be nothing before the cold winds! Even if the Sword Domain was there to enhance them, the sword energy could barely fight against the cold winds!

In the Sword Domain, the sword energy was growing fewer and fewer in number. It wasn’t just that, even Yang Ye’s sword intent was reducing.

All of them were being corroded by the cold winds!

In the Sword Domain, Yang Ye closed both his eyes, and then the intent sword in his grasp vanished. It was in front of her when it appeared once more.

Now that it was being enhanced by the Sword Domain, the speed of his sword was indescribably fast!

However, it was such a swift attack that was stopped with ease!

Yang Ye’s sword was pressed against her palm, and no matter how hard he tried, he couldn’t push it any further forward!

The woman shook her head lightly.

Bang!

Yang Ye was instantly blasted 300m away!

She looked him in the eyes, “The weak should realize their own position!”

Yang Ye chuckled, “You’re right, but the weak can also choose to fight back.”

Yang Ye tapped his right foot down.

Hiss!

A ray of sword energy flashed!

The woman clamped down on it with two fingers, and just that succeeded at stopping Yang Ye’s sword energy. Or to be more precise, she had clamped Yang Ye’s sword!

It couldn’t move at all!

The sword intent around Yang Ye couldn’t approach her at all.

She exerted a little strength with her fingers.

Crush!

Yang Ye’s intent sword exploded apart, and then Yang Ye was blasted away as if he’d been struck by a sledgehammer.

The woman waved her right hand, and a gust of cold wind swept out!

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!

The sound of something being sliced arose on the bridge, and then it was like a million blades were slicing Yang Ye, causing blood to spray in all directions.

Bam!

Yang Ye crashed to the ground and blood covered the ground!

As soon as he crashed there, the woman flicked a strand of cold wind that slashed at Yang Ye’s stomach.

Bang!

Yang Ye was blasted over 300m away!

And the ground there was covered in blood!

A moment later, she appeared before him and looked down at him, “Backbone?”

She shook her head slightly, “You can only have that with enough strength, if you don’t, you must bow. Understand? I’ll give you a chance, a chance to live. Stand up and kneel before me, kneel until I’m satisfied…”

Suddenly, Yang Ye jumped up and countless rays of sword energy enveloped her.

Bang!

An explosion resounded, and Yang Ye’s sword energy vanished. An instant later, Yang Ye’s figure curled up as it was blasted away.

The woman’s face was icy cold without a trace of emotion, and there was a bloody mark on her face!

Yang Ye’s attacks weren’t that weak!

Yang Ye crawled up from the ground. At this moment, he was covered in blood, but his sword intent was extremely solid!

No matter how many times she attacked him, and no matter how many times his sword intent was dispersed, it would condense again!

So long as Yang Ye was alive, it would never truly disperse!

Once he crawled up to his feet, Yang Ye wiped off the blood on the corner of his mouth, and then he looked up at her. Meanwhile, she’d vanished on the spot, and it caused Yang Ye’s pupils to constrict. A moment later, he swung his sword with both hands.

13 overlapped swings with the Sword Domain!

When the final swing descended…

Bang!

The Boundless Water below rose up in waves!

The woman’s expression remained composed as a gust of cold wind suddenly appeared above her, and Yang Ye’s attack descended upon the cold wind.

Bang! Bang! Bang!

When the final swing descended, the cold wind was still there!

Meanwhile, the woman stretched out her right hand, and her palm slapped against Yang Ye’s stomach.

Bang!

Yang Ye was blasted over 3km away, and as soon as he dropped to the ground, cracks extended like spiderwebs throughout his body.

His body was on the verge of shattering!

It was simply horrifying!

Actually, after he attained the Lord Realm, if he was given Executor and his other treasures, he would have the strength to fight her. Yet now, he had nothing. Under such circumstances, he couldn’t fight her!

The gap in their cultivation was absolutely huge!

She appeared before Yang Ye, gazed at Yang Ye’s who was on the verge of death, and said, “At such a young age, you possess the Sword Domain, such strong sword intent, an extremely pure bloodline, and your combat strength is even slightly stronger than a peak Lord Realm expert. It’s really a pity if you die just like this.”

As she spoke, she bent forward to look at Yang Ye’s almost unconscious figure, “So long as you beg for mercy, I’ll spare your life, alright? Just beg for mercy!”

It was nothing more pleasing than making someone unyielding kowtow and beg for mercy!

Yang Ye had been so stubborn and unyielding before her just now. Now, she wanted to trample on it all.

Yang Ye’s right hand trembled as he spoke, “L-Little Qi, take care of Snowy and the others…”

Bang!

In an instant, Yang Ye’s sword intent started to burn.

It was burning!
