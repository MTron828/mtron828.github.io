Chapter 1985 – Flee!

Fight them?

Everyone exchanged glances. Our chances are quite horrible!

Qin Chuan hesitated for a moment and said, “Big Sis, I think we should flee!”

“Flee?” A’Man shook her head slightly while a trace of bitterness curled up on the corners of her mouth. Flee where? We can’t flee anywhere. Demon beasts have surrounded the city. Not just the city, even the sky! There are no less than 100 Wyverns up there!

There was no place to run!

Qin Chuan and the others were clearly aware of this too, and that was why their faces were gloomy.

Mad Saber asked, “Why have these demon beasts come from Hell Mountain Range?”

A’Man shook her head, “Yu Jing investigated but wasn’t able to find out anything. However, based on the information I obtained, we aren’t the only ones who’re facing this problem. The Dire Wolves and Southern Qilin Mountain are being attacked too.”

Yu Jing spoke softly, “The situation in this place is about to change!”

Rumble!

Suddenly, the demon beasts down below started to attack in groups. They attacked in the most direct and violent method—slamming themselves against the city!

So, City Residence City started shaking violently. At the same time, the barrier of light around the city started to crack more and more. Obviously, it wouldn’t be able to hold on for long!

A'Man closed her eyes slowly, “Get everyone prepared to charge outside!”

Flee!

They naturally had to flee. There were too many demon beasts, so it was impossible to annihilate them. Thus, A’Man could only choose to flee!

They nodded. Fleeing was the only way out for them right now!

A’Man gazed at Ling, “How is it?”

Ling nodded slightly. He flicked his finger and over 60 rays of light flashed into every single one of their foreheads.

A'Man explained, “These are our last words. Remember that if any of you get out of this place and return to the large world, then don’t forget our last words. Send as many as you can. In any case, just do your best!”

They nodded. Besides a few of them, all the others had family in the outside world! Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

It didn’t take long for the cracks on the barrier of light to widen.

Finally…

Boom!

The barrier of light that covered Sky Residence City exploded apart into fragments of energy that rained down from the sky. Now that they didn’t have the protection of the barrier, the walls around the city collapsed in an instant.

Countless demon beasts charged at A’Man and the others!

A’Man flipped her palm in midair and withdrew the spiked club, “I hope we’ll be able to see the sunrise again!”

She charged forward once she finished speaking!

Qin Chuan and the others followed behind her.

However, it only took a while for them to be drowned within the army of demon beasts.

Even though they weren’t annihilated in an instant, they were on the verge of it. After all, there were too many demon beasts, and they weren’t weak at all!

At this moment, practically all of them were injured.

Bang!

Qin Chuan slapped his palm at a demon beast, but he was blasted away by the force of the collision. As soon as he stopped himself, another demon beast slammed itself against him.

Bang!

Qin Chuan was blasted away again. Meanwhile, two more demon beasts slammed themselves at him. This time, he couldn’t avoid them.

Boom!

Suddenly, the demon beasts were blasted away. A’Man appeared in front of Qin Chuan and grabbed him. She spoke fiercely, “Don’t give up!”

Qin Chuan laughed bitterly, “Big Sis, we probably won’t be able to escape this calamity!”

A’Man closed her eyes slowly, “I’ll definitely lead all of you out of this!”

As soon as she finished speaking, she glanced at the surroundings. Some had fallen, and one of the demon beasts was even swallowing one of their corpses. A’Man’s eyes instantly turned blood red when she noticed this, and she tossed her spiked club at that demon beasts.

Bang!

That demon beast’s head instantly exploded into a mist of blood!

A’Man glanced at the surroundings and spoke fiercely, “Don’t give up!”

Bang!

Meanwhile, she was blasted away. A completely red demon beast that looked like a lion was standing where she had been. It was extremely huge, and it was covered in flames!

The demon beast stomped its right foot down and slammed a punch at A’Man!

A vicious glow flashed through A’Man’s eyes, and then she flung the spiked club at the demon beast.

Bang! Bang!

Two explosions resounded, and then A’Man was blasted away. She flew over 1km away before she stopped herself, and she was surrounded by the demon beasts in the surroundings.

“Big Sis!” A furious shout resounded, and then a few people charged at the demon beasts.

Rumble!

The demon beasts around A’Man were blasted away, and she appeared before their fields of vision.

She was alive!

All of them heaved sighs of relief at the sight of this, but she was clearly heavily injured!

it didn’t take long for them to form a circle around A’Man.

Endless demon beasts surrounded them.

A’Man laughed bitterly as she stood at the center of them, “It looks like we’re all going to die here!”

“HAHA!” Qin Chuan suddenly started laughing, “What’s there to fear? Actually, being able to die with all of you isn’t that bad!”

All of them nodded.

They were from various clans and powers in the outside world, and in that environment, practically all of them would have been scheming against each other. But that didn’t happen here.

A’Man grinned, “Alright, we weren’t able to be born on the same day, but we can die on the same day! Kill!”

All of them were about to charge.

Suddenly, a sword howl resounded from far away in the sky, and then a ray of light shot down and descended before them.

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!

The demon beasts around the area where the ray of light landed were instantly sliced into pieces by numerous rays of sword energy!

The light dispersed to reveal a man.

The man smiled, “How can you leave me out of such a battle?”

Yang Ye!

It was Yang Ye.

All of them smiled when they saw him. Yang Ye could choose not to come, but he still had.

There was no need to say anything!

A’Man walked over to Yang Ye. She didn’t say anything and just patted him on the shoulder, “Since you’re here, then kill a few more! At least your death won’t be in vain!”

Qin Chuan walked over to Yang Ye and punched Yang Ye on the shoulder, “We were thinking of letting you avenge us, but you came to give your life away instead. Sigh!”

Yang Ye chuckled and spoke seriously, “Follow behind him. Stay close! Let’s kill our way out!”

As he spoke, he turned around to gaze at the demon beasts and spoke fiercely, “The large universe will belong to us in the future, so how can we just die here? Come with me!”

Yang Ye stomped his right foot down.

A sword howl resounded, and a ray of light charged forward before them.

“Let’s kill our way out!” The others behind Yang Ye roared with fury and followed after him.

Yang Ye’s job was to open up a path, and it was obvious that he faced the greatest pressure. Because he couldn’t stop. Once he stopped, they would lose the imposing aura they’d created, and that would be a disastrous blow to them!

Yang Ye’s sword had been exchanged for the Sword Supreme.

He swung it incessantly, and rays of light flashed out successively. Every single ray of light either injured or killed its target.

Just like that, Yang Ye led them swiftly towards the distance.

Yang Ye was at the front, A’Man was on his right, Mad Saber on his left, and Ling was in midair.

Ling contributed tremendously. Because some demon beasts were descending towards them from above, and Ling kept them all away. So, none of those demon beasts could descend upon them like that.

So, the pressure he endured could be said to be only second to Yang Ye!

There were over 60 of them, and all of them were extraordinary geniuses. However, they still couldn’t withstand the numbers that the demon beasts had. So, it didn’t take long for them to fall in succession.

At this moment, Yang Ye’s eyes were closed while his sword was swung incessantly. Every single swing would make bloody heads fly into the air. However, an endless ocean of demon beasts still resided before them, and it simply seemed endless.

Some of them started to feel despair!

“Don’t lose hope!” Suddenly, Yang Ye howled with fury, and everyone gazed at him.

Yang Ye stomped his right foot down, and a wave of terrifying energy suddenly appeared here.

The Sword Domain!

The Sword Domain instantly covered a huge area of space in the surroundings. Qin Chuan and the others were enveloped by it as well. At the same time, the demon beasts in the surroundings were enveloped as well.

At the same time, 36 ethereal swords appeared in the surroundings.

Yang Ye howled with fury, “Kill!”

Swish! Swish!

In an instant, countless rays of light crisscrossed, and then howls of pain resounded incessantly!

Only rays of light could be seen in the surroundings!

The demon beasts rushed backwards and didn’t dare to get close.

Just like that, around 15 minutes passed before the light gradually vanished, and the demon beasts roared with fury when they saw the scene before them.

Corpses filled the area around Yang Ye’s group. All the corpses were in an extremely horrifying state, and they’d been sliced into countless pieces.

Roar!

Suddenly, a furious howl resounded from the ocean of demon beasts, and then all of them charged madly at Yang Ye’s group.

Endless demon beasts surrounded them from all directions, and they seemed so tiny at the center of the ocean of demon beasts.
