Chapter 853 – A Bad Situation!

Editor: Conspiracing

Mu Hanshan gazed at Yang Ye for a long time before she said, “You know.... Your confidence and arrogance are actually very attractive. Even if you’re only at the Exalt Realm and are quite ugly!”

“Is An Nanjing well?” asked Yang Ye. At this moment, he didn’t have the mood to talk nonsense with Mu Hanshan.

Mu Hanshan replied, “She’s a Half-Saint now, and her natural talent and strength are only slightly inferior to the Junior Sect Master of Sky Divine Hall!”

Yang Ye nodded and said, “Go back and tell her that I’ll come for her soon. It won’t take too long!”

“I will!” Mu Hanshan glanced at him and said, “Aren’t you going to ask about his strength?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “It’s meaningless. No matter how strong it is or how great his natural talent is, I’ll still go get An Nanjing. Oh, and you as well!”

Mu Hanshan gazed at him for a short while, and then she suddenly walked over to him and said, “I noticed that I admire you even more now!”

Yang Ye asked, “And then?”

She stretched out her hand towards him, and then Yang Ye’s expression instantly changed drastically. Because he noticed that he was actually unable to move at all, and he could only watch as her hand touched his face!

The Saint Realm!

This was the strength of a Saint Realm expert!

At this moment, he didn’t even have the strength to fight back against someone at the Saint Realm!

Mu Hanshan’s touched Yang Ye’s face with her hand. A long time passed before she frowned, “There’s something really wrong with your meridians, its injuries aren’t from any ordinary force. This... this is the energy of the Laws....” A long time passed before she withdrew her hand and spoke solemnly, “It was done by a person! Someone wants to cripple you!”

It was done by someone? Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly. He’d thought that his meridians had fallen to such a state because he utilized Heavenrend, but now it would seem like it was far from being that simple!

“While I don’t know what Law this is, I have no doubt that it’s extremely strong. It can be said to be the strongest I’ve ever seen. Who... who exactly have you offended to the point that person actually intends to cripple you? Wait. With that person’s strength, it should have been sufficient for that person to crush you countless times!” Mu Hanshan’s brows knit together tightly.

Yang Ye fell silent as he tried hard to recall what had occurred at that time. Unfortunately, he couldn’t remember anything, and he could only remember feeling like something pushed him.

Could someone have helped me in secret? Yang Ye was frowning as well, and he noticed that it wasn’t so simple anymore.

Mu Hanshan spoke solemnly, “If you come to Sky Divine Hall in such a condition, then you’ll be courting death!”

Yang Ye stopped thinking about that and said, “I’ll deal with my meridians, and I’ll restore my strength as soon as possible. Trust me, I’ll come soon for both of you!”

Mu Hanshan stared at him for a long time before she said, “Pine Prefecture is vast, and it wouldn’t be an exaggeration to call it practically boundless. Pine Prefecture is divided into the north and south. The north is the territory of the Ancient Sword School and the Dao Order, whereas the south belongs to the Endless Devil Sect and Sky Divine Hall. If you intend to come to Sky Divine Hall, then you must travel to the south.”

When she spoke up to this point, Mu Hanshan paused for a moment before she continued, “It’s undoubtedly a daydream to fight Sky Divine Hall with your own strength. So, it’s best if you rely on the Ancient Sword School. While the Ancient Sword School is still slightly inferior to Sky Divine Hall, the gap between them isn’t that huge. If you can make the Ancient Sword School help you, then perhaps you’ll have a chance to take both An Nanjing and me with you!”

Yang Ye said, “I’m not a disciple of the Ancient Sword School!”

“Then become one!” Mu Hanshan continued, “Besides that, don’t underestimate the Dao Order. The Dao Order has existed in the Radiant Dimension for tens of thousands of years, and its resources and reserves can be said to be unfathomable. Those fellows you killed before this can only be considered as nobodies in the Dao Order!”

Nobodies! Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly, “You’re saying that the Dao Order was only playing with me before this?”

She shook her head and said, “They severely underestimated your strength. After all, you’re only at the Exalt Realm, and you don’t possess sword intent. So, they didn’t really take you seriously. However, you’ve exposed your strength in Martial Enlightenment City just now. So, they won’t underestimate you anymore. The next disciple of the Dao Order you meet will definitely be a true monstrous genius!”

Yang Ye nodded and said, “I won’t underestimate my opponents!”

She nodded and said, “That’s for the best. After all, many experts and geniuses die from looking down on their opponents.”

Yang Ye suddenly asked, “Do you know where Nether Maiden, Ding Shaoyao, and the others are?”

Mu Hanshan glanced at him and fell silent.

Yang Ye clenched his fists slowly as he said, “Has something happened to them?”

Mu Hanshan shook her head and said, “No, it’s just that.... I’ll tell you when you have the strength to take us from Sky Divine Hall!”

Yang Ye’s brows knit tightly together, but he didn’t ask about it. He knew that the current situation for those geniuses they took to the Outer Heavens that day was probably very bad!”

My strength! I must recover my strength! Yang Ye took a deep breath. He knew that he had to recover as soon as possible. Not only did he have to recover, he had to attain the Half-Saint and even Saint Realm as soon as possible!

He had Elder Mu, Lu Yan, and the others to protect him on Profounder Continent, but he could only rely on himself now!

“Come as soon as possible. Otherwise, your woman might belong to someone else instead!” As soon as Mu Hanshan finished speaking these words, her figure vanished into thin air.

I’m still too weak. I must improve my strength, recover my sword intent, and attain the Saint Realm as quickly as possible! Yang Ye took a deep breath and sat cross-legged on the ground before starting to absorb the energy stones like a madman. At this moment, he had around 400,000 extreme-grade energy stones, and it was sufficient to improve his physical body’s strength again!

As for his cultivation, he’d decided not to force it up and allow it to improve naturally. That meant allowing his strength to accumulate to a certain extent before rising in a natural manner instead of forcing it to the next realm! Now, his main objective was to ceaselessly improve his physical body because only then could he overlap even more Heavenrends in his attacks, and only then could he execute the true Heavenrend!

Otherwise, he would become crippled every single time he executed Heavenrend, so how would he fight then?

Of course, besides improving his body, he had an even more important goal, and it was to feel the tiny vortex!

As Yang Ye ceaselessly swallowed energy stone after energy stone, energy was being endlessly converted into violet profound energy, and this profound energy was split into two streams. One repaired his body, and it nurtured the cracked meridians and internal organs throughout his body. As for the other stream, it was completely absorbed by the tiny vortex.

Just like that, time passed by slowly, and the energy stones Yang Ye possessed were reducing rapidly. Only around 300,000 remained from the 400,000 he possessed.

Actually, 400,000 extreme-grade energy stones were sufficient for someone at the Mortal Realm to cultivate to the Half-Saint Realm. But in Yang Ye’s opinion, it was still a little too little. Because if extreme-grade energy stones were converted normally, they could be converted into 100 strands of profound energy, but when converted into the violet profound energy within Yang Ye, only around 10 at most remained.

The reason his violet profound energy was powerful was because it was pure and without any impurities!

In the blink of an eye, 2 days had passed, and only 100,000 extreme-grade energy stones remained from the 300,000.

His body had practically recovered, and his body had risen to the next level under the nourishment of the violet profound energy. At this moment, his body was comparable to the body of a demon beast at the mid rank of the Half-Saint Realm!

Moreover, he sensed that his cultivation was at the peak of the Exalt Realm, and it could break through into the Monarch Realm at any moment!

While his body had improved, the tiny vortex still showed no signs of recovering.

Another day passed, and the tiny vortex still didn’t move at all after he’d completely exhausted all 400,000 extreme-grade energy stones that he possessed. This really made Yang Ye feel speechless. Because once the tiny vortex recovered, then he could immediately restore his meridians. Moreover, he would be able to take out and use his treasures like the Herculean Hammer and Stone of Suppression. At that time, not to mention an Exalt Realm expert of the Dao Order, even a high rank Half-Saint of the Dao Order could dream of stopping him from getting to the Ancient Sword School!

Yang Ye didn’t waste another moment of time here. He left the cave, and then he glanced at the surroundings, I made a mistake. I should have gotten a carriage in Martial Enlightenment City!

He couldn’t utilize his profound energy, so it meant that he couldn’t fly, and he could only rely on his physical strength to dash on the ground. A short distance wouldn’t be a problem at all, but the problem was that he had to travel at least 500,000km to get to Matchless City! Moreover, he wouldn’t be able to cultivate if he were to run all the way.

A short while passed before he raised his head and looked towards the distance. There was a group of mountains that towered into the sky within his vision. He was able to sense a few powerful auras amidst the mountains, but none of them belonged to Saint Realm experts!

Yang Ye’s face turned slightly gloomy. He knew that he wasn’t able to sense a Saint Realm expert with his current strength!

Suddenly, the sound of horse hooves hitting the ground resounded from afar, and it didn’t take long for a group to appear within Yang Ye’s field of vision.

It was a cavalry that consisted of around 20 people, and all of them were at the Monarch Realm! There was a luxurious carriage at the center of the cavalry. The reason it seemed luxurious was because it was at least 5 times larger than the carriage he used before! Moreover, it wasn’t just pulled by a single horse but 5 Monarch Realm pegasus horses!

There were 2 men and 2 women at the front of the group, and all of them were at the Monarch Realm as well. Most importantly, there was a small ‘书’ character embroidered on their left chests.

Yang Ye recognized that symbol, it was the symbol of the Ocean of Clouds Academy!

Yang Ye was looking at them, and they were looking at him as well. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“Ugly bastard, what are you looking at? Have you not seen a beauty in your life?” Suddenly, one of the women from the Ocean of Clouds Academy who wore a red dress shouted at Yang Ye.

Yang Ye was slightly stunned, and his gaze which he’d retracted descended once more onto the woman. She was around the age of 20, had a pretty appearance, and a voluptuous body.... While she couldn’t compare to Mu Hanshan, Xiao Yuxi, and the others, she really was a beauty.

Yang Ye pondered deeply for a moment, and then he withdrew the sword chest which Wu Yanzhong gave him and carried it on his back.

“The Ancient Sword School!” Their expressions instantly changed when they witnessed this scene.
