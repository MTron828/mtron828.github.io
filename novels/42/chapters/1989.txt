Chapter 1990 – Lend Me Your Sword!

I’ll be there for you! Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

His voice reverberated like a thunderclap and shook their hearts!

Mad Saber and the others gazed at Yang Ye, and there were complicated emotions in their gazes.

Qin Chuan took a deep and long glance at Yang Ye, and then he gazed at the woman. He was about to do it when laughter came from the side, “Brother Qin, calm down! Calm down!”

Everyone looked over and saw Mo Renyu.

Mo Renyu walked swiftly over to Yang Ye, “Brother Yang, Brother Qin, I’m sorry. I was sent to patrol Cold Wind Ridge, and I just found out about what happened here, so I’m late.”

Yang Ye shook his head, “It has nothing to do with you!”

Mo Renyu hesitated for a moment and said, “Brother Yang, can you spare them?”

Yang Ye looked Mo Renyu in the eyes, and the latter continued, “Brother Yang, Leng Cang isn’t an ordinary person. He’s the nephew of the northern faction’s leader, Wan Qianyou. If you kill him, it may cause tension between the northern faction and southern faction! But we have other external enemies to deal with, so we can’t allow internal strife to occur! I hope you’ll prioritize the overall situation here!”

Yang Ye was about to speak when Qin Chuan suddenly made his stand clear. He shook his head and made Yu Jing help him leave.

Qin Chuan had given up on revenge!

While he wanted to kill them, he didn’t want to drag down his brothers.

Suddenly, Yang Ye said, “Wait!”

Qin Chuan stopped and gazed at Yang Ye. Yang Ye grinned, and then he gazed at Mo Renyu, “Prioritize the situation we are in? I understand. So the northern faction can kill the southern faction as they please, but the southern faction should care about the situation?”

Mo Renyu’s face fell, “Brother Yang, watch what you say?”

“What?” Yang Ye chuckled, “It’s all the truth. It’s what I see right now. Brother Mo, I won’t make things difficult for you.” He glanced at the surroundings, “From this moment onward, we are leaving the southern factions. We’ll leave Southern Qilin Mountain.”

He gazed at Qin Chuan, “Do it if you’re a man!”

Qin Chuan didn’t hesitate at all. His recovered arms instantly slapped down against the woman’s head.

Bang!

Her head exploded into bits.

Leng Cang’s eyes almost split apart with rage, “NO!!”

Qin Chuan was about to kill Leng Cang when the middle aged man suddenly attacked, but Yang Ye attacked at the same time.

A few rays of light flashed!

Bang! Bang! Bang!

The middle aged man was blasted back to where he came from, and Qin Chuan had slapped open Leng Cang’s head.

The middle aged man’s face fell at the sight of this, and so did Mo Renyu’s face. Yang Ye didn’t give him face at all!

Yang Ye lowered his sword and glanced at the middle aged man, “If the northern faction wants to play, we’ll accompany you until the end.”

He gazed at Mad Saber, “Notify the others. We’re leaving now!”

Mad Saber didn’t hesitate to turn around and leave.

“Young Brother, that was rash!” Suddenly, a voice came from afar, and then a middle aged man in an embroidered robe appeared here.

“Father!” Mo Renyu hurriedly went over to the middle aged man, “What are you doing here?”

It was the leader of the southern faction, Mo Tianqiong!

Mo Tianqiong glanced at Mo Renyu, and then he shook his head slightly, “I’m very disappointed!”

Mo Renyu’s face instantly turned pale.

Mo Tianqiong gazed at the middle aged man from the northern faction, “I’ve investigated the sequence of events. He merely took a glance at Leng Cang’s woman, but Leng Cang ganged up on him and crippled him for that. Your northern faction is in the wrong for this. You can leave now. I’ll deal with Wan Qianyou myself!”

The middle aged man didn’t dare to say anything. He just glanced coldly at Yang Ye and left.

Meanwhile, Mo Tianqiong gazed at Yang Ye, “Since you and your friends have joined my southern faction, then so long as you don’t cause trouble, my southern faction will naturally provide you with protection.”

Yang Ye remained silent.

Mo Tianqiong added, “Perhaps you’re unaware of it but Southern Qilin Mountain has been surrounded.”

“Surrounded?” Yang Ye asked, “The demon beasts?”

Mo Tianqiong shook his head slightly, “If only it was just them. The true headache is the locals here. They moved all the way here from far away in the south, and their target is Southern Qilin Mountain!”

Yang Ye asked, “The spirit energy here?”

Mo Tianqiong replied, “That’s only one of the reasons. Do you know that there’s a teleportation formation at the bottom of Southern Qilin Mountain? It was left behind by the people who lived here a very long time ago, and it leads straight to the outside world. That teleportation formation is actually the real reason why there are spirit veins here. Both these spirit veins were specially left here to keep the teleportation formation running.”

Yang Ye asked, “Since there’s a teleportation formation here, why don’t all of you leave?”

Mo Tianqiong chuckled, “In the beginning, we wanted to do just that. After all, this place isn’t suitable to stay in anymore. However, it failed to work. An even bigger formation has sealed the entire Dead Dimension!”

Yang Ye frowned slightly, “An even bigger formation?”

Mo Tianqiong looked up at the sky, “An enormous formation. The spatial passageway between the Dead Dimension and the world outside has been completely sealed off by the formation. So, not to mention leaving, even contacting the outside world is impossible.”

He gazed at Yang Ye and continued, “The only way to leave is by making the formation’s owner deactivate it or by possessing the strength to break through the seal!

The Dead Dimension has been sealed off! Yang Ye looked up at the sky. Obviously, the seal on the Dead Dimension was definitely related to Zhi’er and the god race. Because only they had the ability to accomplish such a thing! Why did they seal off this place?

Meanwhile, Mo Tianqiong continued, “Young Brother, in a situation like this, our best option is to stay closely united with each other!”

Mo Tianqiong vanished into the distance once he finished speaking.

Yu Jing suddenly asked, “Are we leaving or not?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “We’ll stay for now. Right, I need to go somewhere!”

Yu Jing asked, “Do you want us to go with you?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “No. I can do it myself. Just be careful here. The northern faction may not let the matter rest that easily. So, just be careful!”

Yu Jing nodded slightly, “You be careful too!”

Yang Ye gazed at Qin Chuan, “You’re alright, right?”

Qin Chuan nodded. He was injured, but it was only external, and it wasn’t lethal.

Yang Ye flicked 10 immortal crystals to Qin Chuan, “Heal up!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he transformed into a ray of light that vanished into the sky.

This time, Yang Ye’s objective was Zhi’er. He wanted to seek her help and see if she would let Qin Chuan and the others leave the Dead Dimension.

It didn’t take long for Yang Ye to arrive where the river had vanished. He didn’t hesitate to go down, but it didn’t take long for a colossus to obstruct his path.

The Royal Crocodile!

Yang Ye glanced at it and said, “I want to see Zhi’er!”

“Come in!” A voice came from afar.

The Royal Crocodile immediately moved aside but followed Yang Ye while seeming quite hostile to him!

It didn’t take long for Yang Ye to arrive in God Hall, and only Zhi’er was in it.

She asked, “Do you need something?”

Yang Ye nodded, “Is the seal around the Dead Dimension your doing?”

She nodded, “Yes! Why?”

As expected! Yang Ye fell silent for a moment and said, “Can you undo it temporarily?”

She shook her head, “No!”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Why?”

Zhi’er walked over to Yang Ye, “There are some things that I can’t tell you. I know why you’re here, but it carries serious implications. So, I can’t give you what you want.”

Yang Ye asked, “Can you send us outside?”

Zhi’er shook her head slightly, “I told you, no one can leave this place, at least for now. However, you don’t have to worry. You’ll be able to leave soon. It won’t take very long!”

Yang Ye looked her in the eyes, “What are you planning to do?”

She grinned, “Are you sure that you want to know?”

Yang Ye fell silent. His intuition told him that it was better not to know, or he would face a huge amount of trouble.

Meanwhile, she suddenly asked, “Want to get to the peak of the Enlightened Realm?”

Yang Ye didn’t answer her and was slightly vigilant instead, “What do you mean?”

She smiled, “If I wanted to harm you, you wouldn’t be able to resist, right?”

Yang Ye said, “Tell me what your conditions are!”

“Smart!” Zhi’er smiled, “Actually, my condition is very simple. I want you to lend me your sword.”

Lend you my sword? Yang Ye frowned, “Why?”

“I have my reasons!” Zhi’er continued, “Just for two days. I’ll give it back to you after then. As compensation, I’ll help you ascend to the 5th stage of the Enlightened Realm.”

The 5th stage of the Enlightened Realm!

Needless to say, Yang Ye was really tempted. He was at the 3rd stage of the Enlightened Realm right now, and he was quite a bit away from the 5th stage of the Enlightened Realm. Under normal circumstances, it would take him at least two to three years of normal cultivation to attain the 5th stage of the Enlightened Realm!

Yang Ye fell silent for a long time, and then he withdrew the sword, “It has killed many members of the god race. You won’t…” Yang Ye didn’t continue.

Zhi’er replied indifferently, “I wouldn’t go so low as to take revenge on a sword. I told you that if it was in the hands of anyone else, I would definitely kill the person and take this sword. But it’s in your hands. I want to borrow it from you to find out about something, and it’s just that simple!”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and said, “Alright!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he flicked the sword to her.

Zhi’er didn’t take the sword and looked towards the side instead, “Uncle Guan, I’ll leave it to you!”

A white robed old man walked over slowly. He went over to Yang Ye and said, “Please come with me!”

Just like that, Yang Ye left the hall with the old man.

Meanwhile, a voice resounded here, “Is it worth it?”

Zhi’er closed her eyes slowly, “It’s worth it if it’s him!”
