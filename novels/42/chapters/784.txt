Chapter 785 – Reversal Of The Laws!

Translator: InVader

Editor: Conspiracing

The strand of sword intent was definitely like an ant before an elephant when it faced the enormous palm. However, when they both collided....

“AH! What sword intent is that!?” A horrified and furious howl resounded from the horizon.

It didn’t take long for a back robed man to appear before Yang Ye’s group. At this moment, his palm was gradually drying up as if it had experienced the passage of hundreds of years. Moreover, the vitality within him was leaking out like a torrent!

The man looked very young in the beginning, but now, he was quickly aging before them at a visible speed!

“How could this be possible....” The man gazed at his hand in horror. His hand had turned completely pale and was withered like a stick. He raised his head to look at Yang Ye as he said, “Tell me what sword intent this is!”

“Decay!” replied Yang Ye.

“Decay....” A wisp of bewilderment flashed through his eyes as he muttered softly, and then his figure stiffened on the spot. A gust of wind blew by, and the man’s figure transformed into dust that was swept away by the wind.

“How powerful!” Ding Shaoyao spoke solemnly.

The Sword Spirit said, “Decay is like death. Even the regions in space throughout the boundless universe experience a moment of death, let alone people!”

“Then isn’t Yang Ye’s Decay Laws invincible?” said Ding Shaoyao.

The Sword Spirit shook her head and said, “There are a myriad of Laws in the world, and every single one of them has their own advantage and reason that they are strong. Not to mention any other laws, just Nether Maiden’s Laws aren’t inferior to Yang Ye’s. Moreover, it might even be stronger!”

“What Law has she grasped?” asked Yang Ye.

“The Laws of Yin and Yang!” The Sword Spirit’s voice was slightly solemn, “The Reversal of Yin and Yang! However, that isn’t a huge deal. But if she can reverse the Laws and overturn it, then not to mention you, even your master, Elder Mu, and Senior Lu will have to flee before her!”

Yang Ye took a deep breath, looked up into the sky, and said, “Sword Spirit, are the people in the Outer Heavens really extremely strong?”

She nodded and replied, “I’m not saying that their natural talent surpasses the natural talent of the inhabitants of this world, and I’m not saying that all of you’ll really be like ants upon arriving there. Not to mention anyone else, just the strength and natural talent of the Sword Sect’s Founding Ancestor, the Unfettered One, can be considered to be top-rate at the Outer Heavens. As for the geniuses of this generation, the natural talent possessed by Nether Maiden, An Nanjing, and you would be shocking even in the Outer Heavens!”

“Then why is this world so weak?” asked Ding Shaoyao.

The Sword Spirit fell silent for a long time before she said, “There are many reasons. A stellar region is formed from countless worlds, and there naturally is a difference in strength between these worlds. Just like a few twins. The accomplishments of those twins would definitely vary. Most importantly, it was because the experts of this world were too weak and stupid all those years ago!”

“What do you mean?” asked Yang Ye.

She explained, “Any world that is sealed off would definitely suffer decline. Of course, the past experts of this world were idiotic to the extreme. Because they didn’t allow this world to join the Outer Heavens and merge with the other worlds in this region. So, regardless of whether it’s cultivation techniques, combat techniques, or its civilization as a whole, it’s very much inferior to the other worlds. It naturally wouldn’t affect this world in the beginning, but as time passed....”

When she spoke up to this point, her voice became solemn as she said, “Just like this very moment, since it’s lagging behind and inferior to the other worlds, it suffers and is bullied. Understand?”

“The Sword Sect’s Founding Ancestor was so strong all those years ago. Why didn’t he lead this world into the Outer Heavens?” asked Yang Ye.

She shook her head and said, “A pair of fists is no match for many. No matter how strong he was, could he fight the entire Outer Heavens? After all, there definitely were existences in the Outer who were stronger than him. Moreover, the forces in the Outer Heavens had joined forces with the intention of crushing the defiant profounders all those years ago. If the Sword Sect’s Founding Ancestor led this world there, then it represented that he would have to fight countless powers and experts from the Outer Heavens. Not to mention he was all alone, even 10 experts on par with him wouldn’t be sufficient! He....”

The Sword Spirit suddenly stopped speaking, and then she gazed at Yang Ye and said, “You’re finished!”

“Indeed!” Ding Shaoyao nodded with agreement.

Yang Ye laughed bittered. He was finished indeed. Because if he wanted to save the inhabitants of Profounder Continent, then it meant that he would have to lead them into the Outer Heavens. But if he did that, then it would be equivalent to going against countless powers and experts in the Outer Heavens.... Even 10 experts like the Sword Sect’s Founding Ancestor wouldn’t have been sufficient to accomplish that, so wasn’t he finished if he intended to do that now?

Yang Ye shook his head and said, “Let’s not think about that for now. Because even our survival is a problem right now.”

Ding Shaoyao nodded and said, “The heavens always leave a way out. You’ll be able to find it!”

“The heavens don’t exist in this world anymore!” The Sword Spirit spoke coldly.

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

Yang Ye didn’t wait a second longer and immediately rushed to the Ancient City of Hallows. At this moment, he merely changed his appearance yet kept his hair snow white. Of course, he was constantly utilizing the Sword Domain to conceal his aura, and he would naturally be fine if the Sword Domain didn’t suffer any powerful attacks that he couldn’t resist!

All along the way, Yang Ye encountered countless corpses. The corpses were in quite horrifying states. According to the Sword Spirit, the defiant profounders had done so intentionally because they wanted the dead to be unable to rest in peace and surge with resentment.

People were capable of anything when they faced a hopeless situation.

All of this further firmed his resolve to prevent the defiant profounders from coming to Profounder Continent!

Yang Ye entered safely into the city again with the Sword Spirit’s help. Yang Ye was shocked when he entered the city and saw the situation in the city. At this moment, the Ancient City of Hallows was actually filled with corpses, and there were even people fighting incessantly in the city!

The defiant profounders breached the city? Yang Ye stretched out his hand and grabbed over one of the people in the distance. That person gazed at Yang Ye with horror, and he was about to say something when Yang Ye spoke before him, “What’s going on? Have the defiant profounders got into the city?”

The man swallowed down a mouthful of saliva. He was clearly terrified of Yang Ye.

“You’ll die if you don’t answer me quickly!” Yang Ye squeezed down a little on the man’s neck.

The man hurriedly said, “It isn’t the defiant profounders. We’re fighting for a treasure!”

“A treasure? Explain properly!” Yang Ye frowned.

The man said, “Two days ago, a Saint Spirit Fruit capable of allowing others to instantly become Half-Saints appeared within the city. So long as one can consume it, then one would be able to immediately break through all barriers and attain the Half-Saint Realm.” When he spoke up to this point, the man seemed excited, and his eyes were filled with fervor and excitement, “There isn’t just one of those fruits. There are many. I’ll be able to instantly break through to the Half-Saint Realm by seizing any one of them!”

“Instantly attain the Half-Saint Realm?” Yang Ye asked, “Do you even believe that?”

“I do!” The man said, “Many of us saw someone get one of the fruits and instantly become a Half-Saint! It’s true!”

Yang Ye’s brows knit together tightly. He glanced at the surroundings and said, “So many people have died in the city. Is the Hallowed Halls not doing anything about it?”

“The Hallowed Halls?” The man was stunned for a moment before he said, “They did in the beginning, but then they didn’t take any further action.”

“So that’s what’s going on!” Yang Ye understood now. It was probably a scheme of the Hallowed Halls. It naturally couldn’t act and kill the people in the city who hadn’t attained the Half-Saint Realm. After all, many people in the city would definitely fight back if that were to happen. But if they used such a method, then not only would no one fight back, they could even save a lot of effort. Because the people in the city would fight and kill themselves, and the Hallowed Halls only had to watch coldly from afar and add fuel to the flame at the critical moment!

The Hallowed Grounds has started to make its move!

In the Hallowed Grounds’ opinion, everyone else beneath the Half-Saint Realm was a burden to them. So, it was best for such people to just die. Moreover, their deaths would even increase the amount of resentment, baleful energy, and blood energy in the world!

“Brother, I heard that there’s a Saint Spirit Fruit in Lunar Rite Hall. Many have headed over there. With your strength, you might be able to seize it if you head over quickly....” The man hadn’t even finished speaking when he felt something flash before his eyes, and then Yang Ye had vanished.

“How strong....” The man broke out in cold sweat.

Even though Yang Ye was hostile to the Hallowed Grounds, he had some feelings for Lunar Rite Hall. After all, its members had helped him quite a bit when he needed it. So, he naturally couldn’t stand by idly.

...

Lunar Rite Hall.

At this moment, it was completely surrounded. There were Monarch Realm experts, Exalt Realm experts, and even Spirit Realm experts amongst the people here. As for the members of Lunar Rite Hall, Mu Qingfeng led the group as they stood in confrontation with the others who’d surrounded Lunar Rite Hall. Moreover, there were some corpses around Mu Qingfeng’s group, and most of them were the corpse of Lunar Rite Hall’s members!

At this moment, Mu Qingfeng’s veil was blood red, and there were no less than a few dozen injuries on her.

“Luo Chongxiao, Gu Yuexian. I told you that my Lunar Rite Hall doesn’t have a Saint Spirit Fruit!” Mu Qingfeng spoke in a low voice.

Gu Yuexian grunted coldly and said, “Why should we believe you? Mu Qingfeng, I’ll give you one last chance. Otherwise, everyone from Lunar Rite Hall can just die today!”

“Wouldn’t we be letting them off too easily if we do that?” The man by Gu Yuexian’s side spoke ferociously, “Everyone, let’s kill the men of Lunar Rite Hall, but keep the women alive. The women of Lunar Rite Hall are all the best women of the Hallowed Halls. Don’t you want to give them a try? Don’t worry, all of you’ll be able to enjoy them to your heart’s content. Especially the Hall Master of Lunar Rite Hall. She always acted high and mighty in the past. Now, I’ll make her scream beneath all of you!”

“Hahaha! That’s a good idea. I’ve been waiting to play with them for such a long time!”

“It would be a waste not to! Hahaha!”

The members of Lunar Rite Hall were furious. They were about to attack but Mu Qingfeng stopped them. Her gaze descended onto the man who stood by Gu Yuexian’s side and said, “Lou Chongxiao, Gu Yuexian. Both of you planned this, right?”

“So what if we did!?” Lou Chongxiao’s voice was icy cold, “Since that fellow, Yang Man, isn’t here anymore, then Lunar Rite Hall will pay the price for him. Don’t worry, I won’t kill the women of Lunar Rite Hall once we have our fun with them. I’ll crippled their cultivations and put them on the streets so that everyone can have a go! Mu Qingfeng, you won’t be an exception!” 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“I wanted that woman, Fu Jinxian, that day. But Lunar Rite Hall obstructed me. Now, I’ll allow all of you to know the price you have to pay for helping Yang Man that day!” said Gu Yuexian.

“Kill the men and keep the women alive! Attack!” As soon as he finished speaking, Luo Chongxiao led the charge towards the group from Lunar Rite Hall!
