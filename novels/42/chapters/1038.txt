Chapter 1039 – Leave No One Alive!

“No? This is only just the beginning!” Yang Ye laughed coldly, and then he shot towards Kaiyang Jun.

“Stop him!” Instructor Zhuo roared, and then he and the other 2 unharmed Saints flashed towards Yang Ye like bolts of lightning.

As far as they were concerned, Yang Ye was definitely bringing calamity to the academy by killing Kaiyang Jun and his companions. Yang Ye didn’t care about that, but they had to! If they let Yang Ye kill Kaiyang Jun and the others, then it would be obvious that their plans to return to White Deer Academy would be just a dream. So, Kaiyang Jun and his companions could absolutely not be allowed to die!

Suddenly, a ray of green light and red light flew down from the sky, and it only took an instant for them to descend before Yang Ye and obstruct Instructor Zhuo’s group.

The light vanished to reveal Qing and Hong’s figures.

Instructor Zhuo and the other 2 Saints stopped immediately when they saw Qing and Hong, and then Instructor Zhuo spoke with a gloomy expression on his face, “These are internal affairs of my Ocean of Clouds Academy. I hope that you don’t interfere!”

Qing paid no attention to Instructor Zhuo and just gazed at Yang Ye.

Yang Ye glanced at them, and then his gaze descended onto Hong. At this moment, Hong was a Saint, but her aura was clearly comparatively weaker than Instructor Zhuo and the others who were seniors in the Saint Realm.

“What are you looking at? Don’t make me dig your eyes out!” Hong immediately glared at Yang Ye and spoke fiercely when she noticed Yang Ye’s gaze on her.

Yang Ye disregarded her and gazed at Qing, “Don’t let them interfere!”

Qing nodded lightly, and then she returned to her original form. A huge green python appeared here, and then her extremely long tail swept towards Instructor Zhuo and the others.

Instructor Zhuo and the others’ faces turned grim, and they weren’t able to dodge and could only block it by force!

In the end, Instructor Zhuo and the others didn’t dare to violate the unspoken rule of the Radiant Dimension, and they entered into a pocket of space with Qing and fought Qing there.

Yang Ye’s gaze descended onto Hong, “Go help your younger sister!”

“I don’t need you to tell me that!” Hong grunted coldly, and then she transformed into a ray of red light that shot into the sky and vanished in an instant.

“Yang Ye!” Meanwhile, Kaiyang Jun who was holding Xing Chen’s corpse in his arms suddenly stood up. His eyes were completely bloodshot while a ferocious expression covered his face, and the killing intent he emanated was simply visible.

Yang Ye raised the Herculean Sword slightly and pointed it at Kaiyang Jun and Qin Yuan, “Come at me together?” He wasn’t being arrogant when he said this. Not to mention his current strength, even his past strength was something that was impossible for them to best. If his past strength was compared to his current strength, then the only difference would be that it was much easier to deal with them now, very much easier!

“Xing Chen’s older brother is the 15th ranked expert in White Deer Academy. Do you know what the rankings of my White Deer Academy is like?” Kaiyang Jun spoke in a fierce tone, “You don’t! Yang Ye, you’ll pay a horrible price you can’t bear to pay for what you’ve done! Trust me, you’ll die a miserable death!”

“The 15th?” Yang Ye chuckled, “He sounds quite formidable. Alright, I really have no mood to waste my breath on both of you. Since you refuse to attack, then allow me.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye swiftly stomped his right foot against the ground, and an explosion resounded as the ground beneath his feet collapsed. Meanwhile, he relied on the counterforce to instantly appear before Kaiyang Jun and Qin Yuan, and then the Herculean Sword smashed down towards them.

Kaiyang Jun and Qin Yuan’s expressions changed, and they could only raise their palms and slap them forward in the short amount of time they had to react. 2 huge palms which carried terrifying might slapped Yang Ye’s Herculean Sword.

Bang!

A huge explosion resounded! Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Crack!

The 2 huge palms shook violently before Yang Ye’s sword, and then countless cracks covered them. Kaiyang Jun and Qin Yuan were shocked by this scene as they’d never imagined that Yang Ye was actually capable of going head-on against their joint forces on his own. Moreover, Yang Ye was still using just his physical strength!

How strong is his body?

“Break apart!” Yang Ye roared furiously as he twisted his wrist.

Bang!

A huge explosion resounded as the palms instantly exploded into pieces, and then waves of energy swept out towards the surroundings. Kaiyang Jun and Qin Yuan were instantly blasted almost 3km away, whereas Yang Ye remained motionless on the spot. Because his Void Rank sword intent had instantly minded the wave of energy into bits when it came close to him!

“Lightning Tap!” Meanwhile, Kaiyang Jun’s howl of rage resounded through the area. The clouds in the sky were suddenly torn open as a huge finger that carried destructive arcs of lightning emerged from behind the clouds, and it descended towards Yang Ye. Everywhere it passed, a long arc of lightning was left in its wake, and it tore apart and blasted apart the space around it!

It was a mid-grade Divine Rank technique at least!

The countless cultivators of Ocean of Clouds City were shocked by this scene, and they started dashing backwards and only stopped after they were around 10km away. However, the powerful energy contained within the finger still caused their souls to shudder.

Yu Wushuang and the others had moved aside as well. Because they would only be a burden to Yang Ye if they were to stay close to him now!

Moreover, their eyes were filled with worry!

Yang Ye’s eyes had a slight shred of seriousness in them as well. Needless to say, Kaiyang Jun had some skill. After all, a mid-grade Divine Rank technique couldn’t be cultivated successfully just because one had the technique in their possession. It was just like his Divine Fist of Destruction or Death by a Thought, they had very harsh requirements!

“Hahaha! Yang Ye! That’s a mid-grade Divine Rank technique. It’s the technique Kaiyang Jun is known for! Let me see how you’ll stop it!” Qin Yuan roared madly. He was a sword cultivator and Yang Ye possessed Void Rank sword intent, so he was completely powerless before Yang Ye! That made him feel aggrieved to the absolute limit!

Yang Ye disregarded Qin Yuan and flipped his palm, the Herculean Sword was instantly exchanged for Yellow Springs. Void Rank sword intent surged out from within him while Yellow Springs resided in his grasp, and then he transformed into a ray of light that tore through space and shot into the sky!

The ray of light slammed against the huge finger in midair!

A moment of silence ensued.

Bang!

It was like a thunderclap resounded through the world, and the sky shook violently.

The spectators watched as the huge finger instantly exploded into pieces, and then countless waves of energy shot through the sky and even caused the space in the surroundings to warp before them.

Kaiyang Jun and Qin Yuan were astounded when they witnessed this scene! It was especially so for Kaiyang Jun. His mind had gone blank when he witnessed the might of Yang Ye’s attack.

Even a mid-grade Divine Rank technique is useless against him?

After all, even Saints would dare not go head-on against that technique of his in the past! However, Yang Ye who was merely a mid rank Half-Saint had destroyed it in a head-on collision!

Is he really from the Pine Prefecture and not from the Central Divine Prefecture?

Om!

Suddenly, a sword howl resounded in the sky, and then a ray of sword energy shot down like a bolt of lightning towards Kaiyang Jun and Qin Yuan!

Kaiyang Jun and Qin Yuan were horrified. They’d personally witnessed the might of Yang Ye’s attacks, so how could they possibly resist it? They wanted to flee, but they were shocked to notice that a strand of terrifying intent had pressed down upon them like a mountain, causing them to be unable to even move an inch. So, they had no choice but to join forces and face Yang Ye’s attack.

They immediately slapped their palms towards Yang Ye’s attack, and 2 huge palms flashed forward once more and slammed against Yang Ye’s attack!

Bang!

The sword energy instantly blasted those huge palms into pieces and struck them.

Pu! Pu!

Both of them spat out a mouthful of blood while their figures were blasted flying!

“Amazing!” At this moment, the blood of countless cultivators throughout the city. During the short period that Kaiyang Jun’s group had taken control of the city and academy, it had been like a nightmare for them. If they were to be honest, they didn’t want to leave the city, or it should be said that many of them treated the city like their home!

But as soon as Kaiyang Jun’s group arrived here, they’d started to plunder the residents of the city. Moreover, those who refused were even slaughtered by Kaiyang Jun’s group. So, the residents of the city didn’t dare to voice out the rage they felt. Now, when they watched as Kaiyang Jun and the others were either killed or defeated, the rage that had been repressed within them had finally exploded forth!

Cough! Cough!

Kaiyang Jun and Qin Yuan crawled up slowly from the ground. Meanwhile, Yang Ye appeared in front of them, and then Void Rank sword intent pressed down upon them and pressed them back down to the ground.

Qing Yuan raised his head and gazed resentfully at Yang Ye, “Yang... Yang Ye! If you dare to kill us, then White Deer Academy will definitely slaughter Ocean of Clouds Academy and Ocean of Clouds City!”

Hiss!

Qin Yuan had just finished speaking when a ray of light flashed, and then his head rolled down to the ground while a fountain of blood sprouted from his neck!

Kaiyang Jun instantly turned ghastly pale!

Yang Ye pressed Yellow Springs against the center of Kaiyang Jun’s forehead, “I’m really interested in those 13 puppets of yours. How do I control them?”

“You want to control them? Haha! Yang Ye! You’re dreaming!” Kaiyang Jun laughed like a madman, “Yang Ye, kill me if you want! Why waste your breath? No one in my academy is afraid of death!”

“As you wish!” A ray of light flashed, and then Kaiyang Jun’s head rolled down to the ground and stopped just beside Qin Yuan’s head.

After he killed them, Yang Ye waved his right hand and their spatial rings instantly flew into his palm. He glanced at their contents and flicked them over to Yu Wushuang, “Everything they took is in these. I’ll leave it to you!”

Yu Wushuang glanced at Yang Ye and nodded!

Yang Ye raised his head and looked up into the sky, and then he issued a command in his heart. The 10 shadowy figures immediately appeared before him. At the same time, the 13 copper figures appeared near Kaiyang Jun’s corpse. At this moment, all 13 copper puppets were terribly damaged and were on the verge of breaking apart, but they could still fight!

Yang Ye was about to study those copper puppets when Qing and Hong appeared before him, and their faces were slightly pale while blood could be seen on the corner of their mouths.

Qing said, “We can’t hold them back any longer!”

Yang Ye turned around and saw Instructor Zhuo’s group descending from the sky. Their expressions changed drastically when they noticed Kaiyang Jun and Qin Yuan’s corpses.

Instructor Zhuo pointed a finger at Yang Ye and roared furiously, “Yang Ye! Do you realize what you’ve done? You’ll bring calamity to our academy!”

Yang Ye glanced at them, and then he glanced at the students who were standing in the distance. He pondered deeply for a short moment, and then he said, “Leave no one alive!”

Leave no one alive!
