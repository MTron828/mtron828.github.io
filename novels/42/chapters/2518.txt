Chapter 2519 – Please Kill Me!

Rules!

At most times, if the rules were fair and others abided by them, then he would do the same. However, if others didn’t, then he would absolutely not!

Treating him with double standards?

Never!

Yang Ye walked slowly toward the hunched man with his sword in hand. Moreover, a black diagram flashed out of Yang Ye’s body, and it instantly enveloped him and the hunched man.

He isolated the world from them!

Only Yang Ye and the hunched man remained within the Myriad World Diagram.

The hunched man suddenly asked, “You want to kill me?”

Yang Ye didn’t waste his breath and just transformed into a ray of light that shot forward.

The hunched man suddenly stretched out his right hand and made a light grasping motion at Yang Ye from afar. In an instant, a ray of dark red flames enveloped Yang Ye. Moreover, the air throughout the area within the Myriad World Diagram was incinerated by these flames.

Besides that, at the instant the flames appeared, the Myriad World Diagram suddenly started to tremble as if it was unable to endure the might of these flames!

Suddenly, a sword stabbed out from behind the flames!

As soon as the sword appeared, the flames around Yang Ye were instantly sliced up into countless sparks.

“Executor!” The hunched man spoke abruptly with a voice that carried undisguised surprise.

Meanwhile, two flying swords shot over. They were extremely fast, but they were blasted away by a wave of invisible force before they could even reach the hunched man!

The hunched man stomped his right foot down lightly.

Bang!

The space before him surged and rippled like a raging river and swept toward Yang Ye.

Yang Ye didn’t retreat but advanced instead, and he swung his sword with both hands!

As soon as his sword descended, the space before him was sliced open. However, the energy didn’t vanish. Moreover, the space all around him started to wriggle as if there was something in there.

Rumble!

Explosions resounded incessantly!

Yang Ye was pushed backward repeatedly while blood seeped out of the corner of his mouth!

The hunched man spoke abruptly, “Kill me? You don’t seem to be capable of that. You…”

The hunched man’s voice stopped abruptly at this point.

It was because a strand of mysterious energy had suddenly appeared here!

The Sword Domain!

As soon as the Sword Domain appeared, Yang Ye instantly succeeded at forcefully suppressing the space within the Sword Domain. At the same time, two flying swords suddenly appeared before the hunched man.

Right at this moment, two black shadows abruptly appeared around the hunched man, and these black shadows blocked Yang Ye’s swords. Yang Ye’s swords couldn’t move an inch forward when facing those black shadows!

However, Yang Ye had already appeared before the hunched man.

A sword slashed down!

11 overlapped Heavenrends. Moreover, they were enhanced by his bloodline, Sword Domain, and physical strength!

As soon as this attack started descending, the hunched man had slowly clenched both his hands.

The attack descended!

Boom!

A rumbling explosion resounded, and then a black shadow was blasted away. It was the hunched man!

At the instant he was blasted away, two swords shot toward him.

Hiss! Hiss!T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

The swords pierced through his body, but the hunched man’s body mysteriously turned ethereal!

A clone!

Yang Ye swiftly spun around, and countless strands of black energy were shooting down at him like a rain of arrows!

Yang Ye stomped his right foot down, “Shatter!”

As soon as he said that, everything seemed to freeze within the Sword Domain. A moment later, countless rays of sword energy crisscrossed throughout the sword domain.

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!

Along with a string of horrifying hissing, the black energy was obliterated.

Meanwhile, two flying swords suddenly appeared at a corner to Yang Ye’s right!

Bang! Bang!

Two muffled explosions resounded there, and then a shadow was pushed backward repeatedly, but it quickly vanished again.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye dodged to the side and swung his sword!

It instantly struck a black shadow!

It was the hunched black robed man.

Needless to say, the hunched man was extremely fast, and his movement technique was very mysterious. However, he may not have realized that he was within Yang Ye’s Sword Domain!

In the Sword Domain, Yang Ye could see everything. So, as far as Yang Ye was concerned, the speed of the hunched man’s movement technique was a joke in here!

In an instant, he suppressed the hunched man.

Two flying swords, Executor, and the ability to analyze within the Sword Domain. The hunched man couldn’t fight back at all, and it only took a few breaths of time for injuries to cover his body. Moreover, he even lost one of his arms to Yang Ye!

However, his strength was extraordinary indeed, and Yang Ye couldn’t kill him no matter what he tried!

Under these conditions, the black robed man could be said to have no choice but to constantly defend himself, and he had no room to counterattack!

Outside the Myriad World Diagram.

Xing Biqing and Ye Zhibei had gloomy expressions on their faces as they gazed at the area ahead. It was enveloped by a mysterious barrier, and they couldn’t see anything inside of it. However, they could sense the violent fluctuations of energy coming from within it.

Obviously, it was definitely a very intense battle!

Suddenly, the black robed man who was seated cross-legged at the side stood up.

They gazed at him. It was clearly quite strange that the man hadn’t left earlier. So, they remained vigilant against him at all times.

The black robed man spoke abruptly, “He has won!”

They turned around, and the barrier created by the Myriad World Diagram vanished. After that, Yang Ye and the hunched old man appeared before them.

But at this moment, the hunched old man was nailed to the ground by two swords, and his head wasn’t on his neck anymore. It was on the ground to his side!

He was dead!

As for the hunched man’s spatial ring, it was in Yang Ye’s possession now. There were 2,700 World Crystals in it! 2,000 were from him, and the 700 should belong to the hunched man.

Besides that, there was a Divine Treasure, a pitch black mirror. The black energy from before had come from the mirror.

He’d made a killing!

Xing Biqing and Ye Zhibei exchanged glances when they saw the hunched man’s corpse, and there was obvious shock in their eyes.

Even if the hunched man wasn’t at the Lord Realm, he was absolutely not very far from it. Yet now, he was lying there, dead! Countless years of bitter cultivation had been lost to greed!

As they say, there was always risk when seeking wealth, but how many lose their lives to that risk?

Yang Ye put his swords away, ignored the corpse, and gazed at them, “Let’s go!”

They nodded and were about to leave, but the black robed man spoke abruptly, “Leave the spatial ring behind!”

Yang Ye stopped and gazed at the black robed man, and the latter said, “He broke the rules, and you killed him because he deserves death. But the Divine Treasure and 700 World Crystals within the spatial ring belong to our organization and not him. Besides that, those 2,000 World Crystals were part of the trade between you and our organization. It was a fair trade, and you’ve obtained the Origin World Pills. So, those 2,000 World Crystals belong to us too.”

Yang Ye smiled, “He was part of your organization. But while he broke the rules, you did nothing about it, right?”

The black robed man replied, “That occurred outside of our business time, so we have no right to do anything about it!”

Yang Ye smiled, “What about now? You’ve come for me because it’s your business hours now? Do you even have the right to meddle in my affairs?”

The black robed man walked over to Yang Ye’s group and said, “We act very fairly and never break the rules here. But the precondition is that others don’t break our rules!”

“Haha!” Yang Ye suddenly roared with laughter, “Don’t you think that’s laughable? When there’s something wrong with one of your people, it’s his problem, and we… Right, we should be considered as your customers. Why should we, your customers, take responsibility for the issues with your people? Or perhaps you think customers like us are easy to bully, and we have to bear with it even if we are bullied? Right?”

The black robed man spoke indifferently, “You’ve killed him! We aren’t trying to avenge him, and that is very fair!”

Yang Ye smiled, “I killed him and obtained his possessions. They are part of my spoils from the battle. I think it’s very fair.”

The black robed man, “Is there no room for discussion?”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and gazed at Xing Biqing and Ye Zhibei, “Leave first! I’ll have a proper chat with them!”

If they were here, he would have things to worry about. It wasn’t that they were weak, and they were absolutely far from weak. If they used their true strength, even he wouldn’t be absolutely certain of being able to defeat them. After all, they were the future patriarchs of two huge clans, so they definitely had trump cards, and those trump cards were definitely very powerful!

The reason he asked them to leave was because he wanted to run wild without worrying about anything!

Ye Zhibei and Xing Biqing exchanged glances and shook their heads.

Xing Biqing gazed at Yang Ye, “Since we came together, we’ll leave together.”

Yang Ye wanted to say something else, but he didn’t after giving it a moment of thought. Both of them were very assertive women, so saying more would just be a waste of time.

Yang Ye walked over to the black robed man. They were very close to each other as he looked the black robed man in the eyes, “Kill me and the spatial ring is yours. Now, I’m standing right here. Please kill me!”
