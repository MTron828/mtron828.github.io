Chapter 2342 – You Deserve Death!

“Void Spirit Energy!” The Immortal Estate’s founding ancestor stared at the petite young girl who’d just arrived, “Who are you?!”

The girl ignored her and just hurled the Immortal Estate’s founding ancestor.

Bang!

The woman was hurled into the estate down below, causing it to explode apart.

The girl didn’t attack again and just gazed at Yang Ye.

As soon as she saw Yang Ye, the icy coldness in her eyes vanished.

She suddenly turned around and said, “All of you deserve death!”

As soon as she finished speaking, she transformed into a ray of dark light that vanished into the Immortal Estate.

Bang!

The entire estate collapsed, and countless shrill cries resounded from within.

In just a short while, it was transformed into a pile of rubble and dirt.

A ray of dark light appeared in the sky, and it dispersed to reveal the petite young girl, and the Immortal Estate’s founding ancestor was in front of her.

A ray of dark light coiled around the Immortal Estate’s founding ancestor, completely immobilizing her!

The founding ancestor of the Immortal Estate closed her eyes slowly, “Now, I finally know what it’s like for a wandering dragon to be toyed by a prawn in the shoal.”

The young girl revealed a cold smile, “Aren’t you just trying to say that your main body isn’t here? I’ll give you a chance, bring it here, and let’s see if I can kill your main body too!”

“You?” The woman gazed at the young girl with undisguised ridicule in her eyes.

The young girl ignored her and walked over to Yang Ye.

She squatted down and placed her hand on his forehead, and then a strand of profound energy immediately converged into Yang Ye.

Meanwhile, a fluffy little head emerged from Yang Ye’s chest. Snowy’s eyes instantly opened wide when she saw the young girl, and then she flew over to the young girl’s shoulder and ceaselessly rubbed her head against the young girl while crying.

The young girl was none other than the queen of the void spirit race in the large universe—the Void Spirit Maiden!

Tian Xiu!

Tian Xiu rubbed Snowy’s head while a rare wisp of gentleness flashed through her eyes.

A short while later, Snowy seemed to have thought of something. She quickly pulled Tian Xiu’s hand and gazed at Yang Ye. At this moment, Yang Ye was in an absolutely horrifying state, and Snowy’s tears flowed like torrents as she gazed at him. She was devastated!

Tian Xiu rubbed Snowy’s head and said, “Don’t cry, he’ll be fine.”

Actually, Tian Xiu’s face was quite unsightly too. If she’d arrived just a moment later, Yang Ye would probably be beyond saving.

With the Primordial Violet Energy and Tian Xiu’s Void Spirit Energy healing him, Yang Ye’s injuries gradually healed.

Around an hour later, Yang Ye opened his eyes slowly, “Tian Xiu…”

Tian Xiu nodded slightly, “How do you feel?”

Yang Ye cracked a smile, “I’ll survive!”

She said, “Then stand up!”

Yang Ye stood up slowly, and then he looked down below. At this moment, the estate below was in ruins, and the founding ancestor of the Immortal Estate was completely immobilized by a strand of dark light.

Tian Xiu suddenly said, “Kill her!”

Yang Ye gazed at her with a puzzled expression on his face.

Tian Xiu said, “I kept her for you.”

Yang Ye fell silent for a long time and said, “I want to kill her with my own strength. While I can’t accomplish it now, I will in the future!”

Tian Xiu said, “I’m not trying to make you borrow my strength to kill her, but there’s a strand of soul within this clone. Devouring her is beneficial to you!”

“Devour her?” Yang Ye was stunned, “I can do that?”

Tian Xiu replied, “My void spirit race has a secret technique called Soul Devourer. It can be described as an evil technique that focuses on devouring the souls of others. The stronger the soul, the more beneficial it will be. I didn’t teach it to you because I was afraid the path you took would be too extreme, but I never expected you to have already taken a very extreme path. Once you cultivate this technique, you’ll devour the souls of all you kill, and in the end…”

Yang Ye hurriedly asked, “What happens in the end?”

Tian Xiu glanced at him and explained, “They will be stored within your body, and you can use their strength when you need it. Either to improve yourself or to use them against your enemies, they will work well for both. If you devour enough souls, you can use them to temporarily improve your realm of cultivation. Just like this person before us, if you devour this strand of her soul, it’s sufficient to allow you to temporarily attain the True Void Realm!”

Yang Ye’s eyes lit up when he heard this. He knew it was an awesome technique! After that, he glanced bitterly as he wished that she’d taught it to him sooner!

Tian Xiu seemed to know what he was thinking and said, “It’s too cruel, and if you rely too much on it, it’ll be disadvantageous to you. Moreover, I’m afraid you’ll stray into the wrong path, infuriate the cultivators of this place, and get attacked by them all. But I never expected you to already be hunted by them all!”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

She didn’t say anything else and just flicked a strand of dark light into his forehead.

A moment later, a strand of information appeared in Yang Ye’s mind.

It was the Soul Devouring Technique!

A long time passed before quite a strange expression appeared on Yang Ye’s face. Just as she’d said, it was quite cruel. Devouring a person’s soul represented that person wouldn’t even have the chance to enter the cycle of reincarnation!

That person would truly vanish from this world.

But he liked it!

Cruelty?

That depended on the person. If you didn’t act cruelly against your enemies, they would be cruel to you. He firmly believed that if the Immortal Estate was given the chance, they would definitely take reincarnation away from him!

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts and walked over to the Immortal Estate’s founding ancestor. The latter stared at him. Her clone had grown much more ethereal, and it would vanish very soon.

Yang Ye didn’t insult her, and he was about to act when she suddenly said, “We’ll meet again.”

Yang Ye nodded, “We definitely will! The next time we meet, I’ll beat you up like a dog! I definitely will!”

Yang Ye raised his palm and pressed it upon her.

Bang!

The clone instantly exploded apart, and countless fragments of her soul dispersed toward the surroundings. Yang Ye waved his right hand slightly, and a ray of dark light immediately appeared at the center of his palm and sucked in all the soul fragments.

Yang Ye revealed an intoxicated expression.

It felt really comfortable!

A long time passed before Yang Ye withdrew his gaze and looked down below. At this moment, the Immortal Estate was in ruins, but many people were still fleeing madly.

Flee!

The Immortal Estate could be said to be truly finished.

This once enormous organization had practically lost all its experts at the True Dao Realm, True Void Realm, and True World Realm. It could be said that it would gradually vanish from Eternal Border in the future.

Suddenly, Snowy grabbed Yang Ye’s hand and pointed ahead.

Yang Ye asked, “There’s something there?”

Snowy nodded repeatedly!

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and said, “Tell it to come over here!”

Snowy gazed at Yang Ye, blinked, and then looked over. After that, she pulled Yang Ye toward that direction.

Just like that, Snowy led Yang Ye and Tian Xiu to the deepest depths of the mountain.

Tian Xiu suddenly said, “The spirit energy here is very abundant!

Yang Ye nodded. The further they traveled in this direction, the purer and more abundant the spirit energy was.

He gazed at Snowy. Meanwhile, Snowy blinked, and then rubbed her paws together incessantly as if she was about to get something.

Suddenly, Snowy stopped, and then she waved her paws at them to tell them to stop. Yang Ye and Tian Xiu exchanged glances, and both of them saw bewilderment in each other’s eyes.

Meanwhile, Snowy jumped over to a mountain wall, sized it up, and then knocked it lightly. A short while later, her eyes lit up, and then she slapped her paws against it.

Bang!

The entire mountain wall shook violently, and then it cracked open. Strands of pure white hair gradually appeared before them.

Tian Xiu’s eyes narrowed slightly, and faint dark light flickered on her right hand.

Snowy looked left and right. In the end, she grabbed a long hair with both hands and pulled hard, but she couldn’t move it at all. At this moment, she seemed to have thought of something and inhaled.

Hiss!

In an instant, countless strands of spirit energy converged to her, and even the pure white hair suddenly started to turn slightly ethereal.

“Who did that?!” Meanwhile, a furious roar resounded like a thunderclap, and then the entire surroundings started to quake.

Snowy was shocked and hurriedly leaped onto Tian Xiu’s shoulder.

The ground and mountain before them collapsed inch by inch, and countless strands of dust and dirt shot up into the air.

Yang Ye and Tian Xiu moved around 3km back with Snowy. At this moment, as they looked down from high above, the entire ground was trembling, and then a head emerged from beneath the ground!

A dragon head! Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

A white dragon head!

As for the white hair Snowy had pulled on, it was the dragon’s beard! However, the beard was countless times larger than it had been a while earlier.

Bang!

The ground collapsed, and then a huge pure white dragon appeared in the sky.

A spirit vein!

And it was a sacred vein too!

The eyes of countless experts who were watching from the shadows had turned red with greed.

It was a sacred vein, and based on its size and purity, it seemed to be on the verge of advancing into an immortal vein!

A sacred vein wasn’t sufficient to arouse the greed of some powers, but an immortal vein was entirely capable of accomplishing that.

It didn’t take long for the space in the surroundings to tremble. Obviously, they were sending messages back to the powers they represented.

Tian Xiu glanced at the sky with icy coldness in her eyes.

Meanwhile, the white dragon suddenly roared with fury, “Who disturbed my sleep?! Come and receive your death!”

Snowy suddenly transformed into a ray of white light that appeared before it.

The white dragon was stunned when it saw Snowy.

Snowy blinked, and then she sniffed lightly.

Hiss!

The spirit energy coming from the white dragon instantly reduced quite a bit. At the same time, its body had faintly turned a little more ethereal.

The white dragon was stunned.
