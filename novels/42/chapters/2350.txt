Chapter 2351 – Northern Sword Sect!

Dye the skies of Eternal Border red with blood!

Sword Scroll gazed at Yang Ye in silence.

This was no sword cultivator, it was a Slayer!

In Eternal Broder, there was a type of cultivator called Slayers. Cultivators like those cultivated in the Dao of Slaughter, they took slaughter as their path. They killed their entire lives, and their lives never ended well.

Yang Ye was on such a path!

Yang Ye didn’t say a word. He just tossed the head aside and walked off.

There were many auras in the surroundings, but none tried to stop him.

Yang Ye’s attack just now had instantly annihilated a True World Realm expert!

The Primordial Axe of Creation had submitted to Yang Ye!

Now, experts below the World Lord Realm were no match for Yang Ye.

The Sword Ruins.

Yang Ye went over to Jian You, and the latter glanced at Yang Ye, “Where do you plan to go?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “I don’t know. I’ll just take it one step at a time.”

She hesitated for a moment and said, “Go to the Northern Sword Tomb.”

“The Northern Sword Tomb?” Yang Ye frowned slightly, “What is that”?

Jian You replied softly, “Where my Jian Clan once resided. It doesn’t belong to Eternal Border, so these powers in Eternal Border don’t have much influence over there.”

Yang Ye shook his head, “With Snowy by my side, I’ll have enemies everywhere, right?”

Jian You shook her head, “The Northern Sword Tomb wasn’t always called that. It was once called the Northern Sword Sect, the number one sect of the Northern Continent. It’s unlike any other continent as it’s a continent that focuses on the sword, and practically 90% of its cultivators are sword cultivators. However, for some reason, it suddenly suffered a decline, and the once number one sword sect of the continent was annihilated overnight!”

She gazed at Yang Ye and continued, “Their Sect Master at the time wasn’t any weaker to that friend of yours, Tian Xiu. His Sword Dao was at an extremely terrifying level, and he was about to enter the Eternal River. Unfortunately…”

Yang Ye gazed at her, “You’re from there?”

Jian You replied softly, “My Jian Clan was part of the Northern Sword Sect. You may obtain great gains with Snowy by your side. Of course, the precondition is that you can get there!”

She turned around and left once she finished speaking.

Yang Ye fell silent on the spot for a very long time, and then he transformed into a ray of light that vanished into the sky.

Yang Ye shot through the sky on his sword. He didn’t conceal himself because it was pointless. No matter where he was, there were people watching him. As for why they hadn’t attacked yet, he didn’t want to know!

World Mountain!

It was a place of teleportation, and it was linked to a myriad of worlds. The Northern Sword Tomb wasn’t in Eternal Border, so he had to teleport via World Mountain.

It could be said that World Mountain was a hub.

It didn’t take long for Yang Ye to get there.

At the peak of World Mountain was an old man. He held a pitch black cane with a dragon’s head at the top, and he was looking at Yang Ye.Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

A World Lord!

Yang Ye descended before the old man, and the latter was about to speak when Yang Ye leaped up and arrived above the old man. A moment later, an axe chopped down at the old man’s head.

The Primordial Axe of Creation!

Bang!

The powerful force of it blasted apart the mountain beneath the old man’s feet, causing a huge amount of dust and dirt to surge up into the air. Meanwhile, the old man was blasted away. However, at the instant his figure was blasted away, a pitch black cane pressed against Yang Ye’s chest. A muffled explosion resounded, and then Yang Ye was pushed over 1km away. But while his figure shot backward, two golden flying blades flashed!

The old man’s expression changed drastically, and he clenched his fists and slammed them forward.

Bang! Bang!

Two waves of powerful energy rippled out from his fists. However, those flying blades instantly struck his fists.

Hiss! Hiss!

A moment of silence later, two arms flew into the air!

At the instant his arms were sliced off, the old man was horrified and retreated rapidly. Meanwhile, three swords shot out of the Sword Gourd on Yang Ye’s waist, and they instantly arrived before the old man.

All three swords didn’t just carry True Dao Realm sword intent, they carried True Dao Realm slaughter intent too!

Three swords shot forward at once!

The old man’s pupils constricted when he saw them.

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!

The swords shot through the old man’s forehead, chest, and abdomen. Moreover, once they shot through the old man’s body, they turned around and shot through him again. In just less than a breath of time, they’d pierced him no less than 100 times!

The old man’s body was transformed into a pile of mush!

Yang Ye issued a command in his heart, and the swords immediately returned to the Sword Gourd. At the same time, the two flying blades returned to him as well.

Flying blades and the Sword Gourd!

He’d used Profound Primal Energy to control the flying blades, causing them to become much, much stronger. Coupled with their own special characteristics, and the enhancement provided by his sword intent and slaughter intent. It could be said that even a True World Realm expert couldn’t resist them with ease. If the madness intent was included, then instantly annihilating a True World Realm expert with them wouldn’t be difficult at all.

As for the Sword Gourd, it was even more terrifying.

It was the first time Yang Ye had realized how terrifying the Sword Gourd was. Those three swords were growing stronger and stronger from the Sword Gourd’s nourishment. Especially at the instant they left it, their might had multiplied by many times! If he used those three swords at any other ordinary time, he would be absolutely incapable of killing the old man. But when they left the Sword Gourd and were enhanced by both his sword intent and slaughter intent, they were entirely capable of killing a World Lord!

If the cultivation wasn’t enough, Divine Treasures could be used to make up for the gap!

The Sword Gourd was a Divine Treasure, and those three swords were Pseudo Divine Treasures. If the old man had a Divine Treasure, he would have definitely not lost to Yang Ye. Unfortunately, he didn’t!

Yang Ye restrained his thought and walked over to the old man’s corpse. He stretched out his hand, and then countless soul fragments were absorbed into his palm.

The Soul Devouring Technique could be considered to be one of his trump cards.

So, he would never forget to absorb the souls of those he killed!

The souls he’d absorbed were sufficient to help him instantly raise his cultivation to the True Void Realm. Moreover, they were sufficient to help him accomplish that more than once. If he could absorb the souls of more experts, then he could even force his cultivation to the True World Realm. As far as he was concerned, if he attained the True World Realm, his strength would definitely undergo a tremendous change.

Once he finished absorbing the soul, Yang Ye started walking toward World Mountain.

He knew that this wasn’t the end of it, or it should be said that it was only just the beginning.

Sure enough, it didn’t take long for a middle aged man and an old man to appear not too far away.

Both of them were World Lords!

The middle aged man glanced at Yang Ye and said, “Yang Ye, a Sprite Progenitor is a divine being of the world, you…”

Suddenly, Yang Ye hurled the Primordial Axe of Creation at the middle aged man.

Hiss!

The axe tore through the air, and space was sliced apart and obliterated in its wake.

The middle aged man’s expression changed drastically when he saw Yang Ye just attack without saying a word. However, his reaction was very fast, and he immediately stretched out his right hand. A white barrier of light appeared before him.

Meanwhile, the old man immediately acted as well. A wave of flames swept out from him and rippled toward the axe.

However, as soon as the flames came into contact with the axe, they were instantly obliterated. An instant later, the axe had torn through the air and slammed against the white barrier of light.

Boom! Boom!

Two explosions resounded, and then the middle aged man and old man were blasted over 300m away. Especially the middle aged man, his right hand had been blasted into bits! He had just one arm now!

The middle aged man gazed at Yang Ye with astonishment. Or to be more precise, he gazed at the axe in Yang Ye’s grasp.

A Divine Treasure’s might couldn’t be stopped by human strength!

Moreover, the weapon in Yang Ye’s hand was no ordinary Divine Treasure!

The middle aged man gazed at Yang Ye and was about to speak. Suddenly, two flying blades appeared out of thin air near him, and realizing their presence caused the middle aged man’s expression to change drastically. He stomped his right foot down and moved over 1km back.

Hiss! Hiss!

However, he’d left two ears behind where he’d stood just a moment ago!

It was the middle aged man’s ears, of course. If he’d been just a little slower, he wouldn’t have just lost his ears, he would have lost his head.

Fully equipped with Divine Treasures!

The middle aged man gazed at Yang Ye while fear filled his eyes.

Suddenly, the Sword Gourd on Yang Ye’s waist shook violently, and then three rays of sword energy flashed out of it.

They were like bolts of lightning that were swift to the extreme!

The middle aged man’s pupils constricted from the sight of them. At this moment, he sensed the aura of death.

Right at this critical moment, a speck of white light appeared before him.

The white light exploded apart!

Boom!

Yang Ye’s swords were instantly blasted back to him.

They floated before him while still trembling!

Yang Ye turned to the side, and he saw an old man in gray robes.

A Limitbreaker Realm expert!

However, the old man’s face was quite pale. Obviously, his condition wasn’t normal.

The old man stared at Yang Ye in silence.

A Limitbreaker Realm expert!

A short while passed before the gray robed old man said, “Yang Ye, my Longevity Sect has been passed down for tens of thousands of years, and countless sect masters have died in the Eternal River. Now, a Sprite Progenitor has appeared, and it’s an opportunity for us and the other powers. Unless you flee to the Eternal Dimension, if you refuse to hand over the Sprite Progenitor, then people will be hunting you down no matter where you go. Allow me to tell you that the other powers have started to summon their experts at the Eternal River. As for their objective, it’s you. You have no chance! Hand over the Sprite Progenitor and flee yourself, then perhaps you’ll have a chance to survive. Otherwise…”

Boom!

Suddenly, a wave of powerful aura swept out from Yang Ye. An instant later, Yang Ye’s cultivation had risen to the True Void Realm!

The old man frowned from the sight of this.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye had swapped the axe for the Sword Supreme, and then he started walking toward the old man, “Flee? Did I tell you that I was fleeing?”

Bang!

Yang Ye’s sword intent instantly rose explosively once he finished saying that.

The True Void Realm!

At this instant, Yang Ye’s sword intent had risen to the True Void Realm with the Sword Gourd’s help!

A moment later, a ray of sword energy flashed.

Hiss! Hiss!

The heads of both True World Realm experts suddenly flew up into the air!

Blood sprayed out like a fountain!
