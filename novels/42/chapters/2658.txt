Chapter 2659 – I Report Truthfully!

Yang Ye shook his head upon hearing Yin Yang Goddess.

Courting death is the first step to doom!

The First God had courted death!

Yang Ye gazed at her, “Who’s the strongest among the forms of Destiny?”

There was a wisp of fear in her eyes as she replied, “A terrifying existence.”

She shook her head and forcefully tore open the space before her, “Let’s go!”

Yang Ye glanced at her. He didn’t ask since she didn’t say, and he just entered the spatial rift.

Just like that, they traveled through layer after layer of space.

Perhaps it was difficult for experts like her to go upward, but going down was easy!

Around two hours later, and after passing through the final layer of space, Yang Ye finally saw the world familiar to him.

Eternal Border.

At this moment, he was back in Eternal border, and Yin Yang Goddess was by his side.

She glanced at the surroundings and said, “It’s not the same as the Eternal Border I remember. Right, I haven’t seen the Desolate Emperor in a long time. I should go say hi.”

Yang Ye suddenly said, “That isn’t necessary!”

She gazed at Yang Ye, and Yang Ye spoke solemnly, “He’s dead!”

“He was killed?” She frowned slightly, “Someone could kill him? That doesn’t sound possible!”

Yang Ye replied, “How do I put it…? Anyway, Destiny arrived, and then told him to enter a door…”

Was it Destiny who killed him?

Actually, it wasn’t entirely Destiny. It was the Desolate Emperor’s own choice. However, it was linked to Destiny!

“Destiny!” Yin Yang Goddess fell silent for a long time, and then she shook her head slightly, “What a pity.”

Meanwhile, Yang Ye asked, “Senior, what do you plan to do now?”

She replied indifferently, “Take me to Heng Wangu and the others. I’m going to test their strength!”

Yang Ye hurriedly shook his head, “Absolutely not!”

“Why?” She gazed at Yang Ye with a puzzled expression on her face.

Yang Ye replied solemnly, “I have some enmity with them. If I go to them, they’ll kill me. So, I dare not!”

She was quite dissatisfied, “What are you afraid of when I’m there?”Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Yang Ye glanced at her and laughed bitterly, “Senior, it’s not that I don’t trust you, but they want to kill me. If I go with you… It’s not that I don’t trust in your strength, but they have the numbers, so…”

He didn’t continue speaking.

She laughed coldly, “You’re afraid that I’ll betray you?”

Yang Ye smiled embarrassedly. She was about to speak when Yang Ye suddenly spoke seriously, “Since you’re not afraid, then I’ll risk my life and lead the way… And I’ll go there with you. Let me see if they dare to attack me when you’re there!”

She nodded while a wisp of praise appeared in her eyes, “That’s right. As a sword cultivator, you must have some courage and bravery, right? Don’t worry, I guarantee that they won’t do anything to you while I’m there.”

Yang Ye nodded, “I can rest at ease with that guarantee. Moreover, I firmly believe that once we get to the End World, your strength will terrify Heng Wangu and the others!”

Yin Yang Goddess roared with laughter. Her laughter was quite enchanting yet heroic too!

Just like that, they arrived at the End Dimension under Yang Ye’s lead, and it only took a short while for them to arrive at the entrance to the End World.

As soon as they arrived there, a man appeared in front of them.

It was the Divine Abode’s master!

His face instantly turned gloomy upon noticing Yang Ye, “Yang Ye! It’s you again!”

Yang Ye was naturally not an unfamiliar face to him. During this period where Yang Ye had vanished, they thought that Yang Ye may have given up on harassing the End World!

But he was back again now!

And he’d even brought a woman with him!

The Divine Abode’s master gazed at Yin Yang Goddess and said, “And who are you?”

Yin Yang Goddess replied indifferently, “Don’t worry about that and ask Heng Wangu to show himself! I’m going to have a fight with him!”

The Divine Abode’s master frowned slightly upon hearing her voice, “You’re a man!”

A wisp of killing intent flashed through Yin Yang Goddess’ eyes. The space between her and the Divine Abode’s master warped strangely, and a ray of flickering light flashed through that expanse of space.

The Divine Abode’s master’s expression changed drastically!

Hiss!

Along with the sound of something being sliced open, the Divine Abode’s master was blasted over 1km away! And one of his arms was gone!

Yang Ye’s eyelids twitched. She’s really strong!

Meanwhile, the Divine Abode’s master’s expression turned extremely unsightly, and he wondered where Yang Ye had found such a terrifying existence!

Yin Yang Goddess glanced coldly at the Divine Abode’s master, “Why don’t you say that again?”

The Divine Abode’s master spoke solemnly, “Who are you? Why are you helping Yang Ye?!”

Yin Yang Goddess replied coldly, “That’s none of your damn business!”

She gazed at Yang Ye and continued, “They are all beyond this teleportation formation?”

Yang Ye nodded, “They are!”

She said, “Let’s go!”

As she spoke, she was about to leave with Yang Ye, but Yang Ye hesitated for a moment.

Yin Yang Goddess was quite displeased by this, “Don’t worry. No one will dare to touch you while you’re under my protection!”

Yang Ye smiled embarrassedly, and then he followed her toward the teleportation formation. The Divine Abode’s master didn’t stop them because he wanted them to go in there. After all, the End World was their territory!

Just like that, Yang Ye and Yin Yang Goddess entered the End World.

A short while later, they arrived within the End World, and then Yin Yang Goddess frowned.

Yang Ye asked, “What is it?”

She spoke solemnly, “I’ve heard about this place in the past, but I never came here. It’s not ordinary at all!”

Yang Ye glanced at her, and he was ready to flee at a moment’s notice. Even though this fellow seemed extremely strong, no matter how strong she was, she wouldn’t be able to resist the joint forces of all the experts here!

Suddenly, a wave of invisible pressure slammed down from the sky. Yin Yang Goddess’ eyes narrowed slightly, and she raised her right hand slightly.

Bang!

The sky shook violently, and the invisible pressure was blasted into bits!

Meanwhile, a voice resounded in the sky, “Mr. Yin Yang.”

Mr. Yin Yang? Yang Ye gazed at her. This fellow is called Mr. Yin Yang? Shouldn’t it be Miss Yin Yang?

Yin Yang Goddess said, “Heng Wangu, you’re getting more and more arrogant. You don’t even come to welcome me when I arrive, and you’re hiding behind there and acting like you’re the boss?”

“Not at all!” Heng Wangu’s voice resounded in the sky once more, “Mr. Yin Yang, I’m quite puzzled. Why are you helping Yang Ye fight my End World?”

Yin Yang Goddess glanced at Yang Ye, “You have enmity with them?”

Yang Ye nodded slightly, “A little.”

She frowned slightly, “You’re hiding something from me. Your strength isn’t sufficient to fight this place at all!”

Yang Ye shrugged, “Senior, it’s obvious that I’ve been fleeing for my life. They are bullying me, lots of them are bullying me!”

Yin Yang Goddess glanced at the surroundings, “So many of you are bullying a junior who just attained the Destiny Realm? Aren’t you a little too shameless?”

The Divine Abode’s master had quite an unsightly expression on his face. Who’s bullying who here?

Yang Ye used the fact that they were afraid of Destiny and kept bullying the End World!

Heng Wangu suddenly said, “Looks like you don’t know much about the enmity between us and Yang Ye!”

Yin Yang Goddess replied indifferently, “I’m not interested in it. Heng Wangu, I heard you’re calling yourself the number one expert through the ages. I’m here to spar with you. So, how about we go somewhere else?”

Heng Wangu spoke indifferently, “It was Yang Ye who told you that, right?”

Yin Yang Goddess replied, “Of course I’m aware of his tricks. However, I just happen to need someone to spar with me. So, cut the crap. Are you going to fight me or not?”

A moment of silence ensued, and then the voice said, “Shall we go somewhere else?”

Yin Yang Goddess laughed coldly and was about to shoot up into the air when she seemed to have thought of something. She glanced at Yang Ye and said, “Right, he’s my guide, so you won’t attack him, right?”

Heng Wangu replied, “We won’t!”

Yang Ye was about to say something when Yin Yang Goddess nodded slightly, shot up into the sky, and vanished far above.

Yang Ye’s face froze when he witnessed this. Dammit! I’m in trouble now!

Sure enough, not long after she vanished, a few powerful auras appeared around Yang Ye, and the Divine Abode’s master was leading the group!

The Divine Abode’s master gazed coldly at Yang Ye, “You’ve really courted death this time, Yang Ye.”

Yang Ye sighed softly. Yin Yang Goddess! Oh! Why would you believe them? What the heck!

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings, and there were at least seven peak Destiny Realm experts here! Moreover, this was definitely not the End World’s full strength. There were still some old geezers comparable to Heng Wangu!

How was he supposed to get out of this?

These fellows had nothing to worry about in here!

It didn’t take long for a few powerful auras to slam down upon Yang Ye. These auras arrived in succession to form a thick wall of aura that surrounded Yang Ye.

They clearly planned to attack him!

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings and didn’t do anything. He closed his eyes slowly instead, and he said, “See that? All of these fellows have been hiding here. I truthfully report that I condemn all evil!”

In the Primordial Pagoda, the woman in black’s face remained indifferent, but the sword before her was trembling slightly.
