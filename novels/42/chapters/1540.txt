Chapter 1541 – What The Heck!

Editor: Conspiracing

At this moment, many demon beasts were looking at Yang Ye.

Their gazes were solemn!

Especially the demon beasts who’d entered the second round. Their eyes didn’t just carry solemn expressions, there was vigilance in them as well!

A single move!

The young man had been at the third position in Yang Ye’s group! However, he’d been beaten down by a single attack from Yang Ye. Even though Yang Ye had launched the first strike and taken the young man by surprise, it still required sufficient strength.

Man Shi and Kuang Jing exchanged glances, and there was happiness in both their eyes. The facts proved that they hadn’t gotten the wrong person on their side!

Suddenly, an old man appeared before them.

A Rebirth Realm expert!

Yang Ye’s face gradually became solemn.

The old man glanced at the young man on the ground, and then he looked at Yang Ye, “Fighting is strictly prohibited before the competition begins. You’re broken the rules. So, you don’t have to participate in the second round anymore!”

Hu Meng and the others were stunned by this, and then their faces became quite unsightly. Because they’d only just recalled the rules, and it was that fighting was prohibited before the competition began.

The other demon beasts smiled when they heard the old man.

After all, one less strong competitor was naturally a good thing for them!

The old man was about to leave after he finished speaking, but Yang Ye suddenly said, “I refuse to accept that!”

All the demon beasts here were stunned when they heard Yang Ye. What is he planning?

The old man stopped and turned to look at Yang Ye, “What did you say?”

Even though his voice was calm, it carried a strand of terrifying pressure. However, such pressure was nothing to Yang Ye. He’d even killed Rebirth Realm experts, so how could he possibly be scared by this pressure?

Yang Ye looked the old man in the eyes, “I refuse to accept it!”

Many demon beasts gasped when they heard Yang Ye. He’s crazy! He dares to go against a Rebirth Realm expert?!

The old man’s eyes narrowed slightly, “Do you know what you’re doing?”

“Of course!” Yang Ye took a step forward and said, “I have no intention to offend you, Elder. However, I have to say something, and I have to get it out of my chest.”

He pointed at the young man in beast skin and continued, “I’m sure everyone saw how he provoked me first. Allow me to ask all of you a question. If someone comes right to you and insults you, what would you do?”

All of them fell silent. Obviously, if they helped Yang Ye right now, it would be equivalent to offending the old man.

Yang Ye gazed at the old man and asked, “Elder, may I ask what we should do when someone insults us?” RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Yang Ye immediately spoke before the old man could reply, “Hit them! Beat them up! Kill them! As a man of the demon race, we can lose the competition, and we can lose our lives, but we can’t lose our dignity and backbone!”

“Well said!” Hu Meng stepped forward, “We men of the demon race can lose everything but our dignity and backbone!”

The other demon beasts nodded to themselves. Indeed, as demon beasts, none of them had a good temper. If they were insulted yet still tried to make a compromise, then they would definitely be looked down upon. Even though they were quite happy that Yang Ye had lost his right to compete, they weren’t against Yang Ye’s previous actions, and they even agreed with it!

Now that they heard what Yang Ye said, it was obvious that the impression that many had of Yang Ye grew quite a bit.

The old man gazed at Yang Ye for a long time before he said, “Even life can be lost but dignity can’t! You’re from the Goat Clan?”

Yang Ye nodded, “I am!”

The old man nodded slightly while his expression eased up tremendously, “I know the Goat Clan. It has always been weak, and it’s really rare for someone like you to come from there. Fine, I’ll give the Goat Clan a chance. Remember to not break the rules again.”

Yang Ye hurriedly cupped his fist, “Thank you, Elder!”

At this moment, Yang Ye heaved a huge sigh of relief in his heart. He knew that he’d made the right bet. The demon race was unlike the human race. In this place, one really couldn’t strive to keep a low profile or be reserved. The more one showed off and acted arrogantly here, the more respect one would gain. Of course, the precondition was possessing the strength for all of that. Moreover, one had to know one’s limits well or it would still be no different than courting death!

The old man nodded slightly, and then he waved his right hand. The teleportation formations which were not too far away from them were activated. The old man glanced at everyone here and said, “Go on in!”

Yang Ye and the others immediately went to the teleportation formations, and it didn’t take long for all 1,000 of them to be teleported away.

After they entered the Spatial Battlefield, many demon beasts returned to their true form. But this time, there were some that didn’t. Yang Ye was one of them. Besides Yang Ye, there were over 20 others that hadn’t returned to their true form. So, Yang Ye wasn’t very unique this time.

Meanwhile, Hu Meng suddenly pointed towards the distance, “See the teleportation formations there?”

Yang Ye looked up. There were 30 teleportation formations around 3km ahead.

Hu Meng said, “Once it begins, the teleportation formations will be activated. We just have to enter them and be teleported out of this place to qualify for the next round.”

Yang Ye was astounded, “It’s that simple?!”

“Of course it isn’t!” Meanwhile, Man Shi shook his head, “Once you enter the teleportation formation, it takes ten breaths of time to be teleported. During this period, the person being teleported can’t move. So, do you think it’s simple now?”

So that’s how it is! Yang Ye finally understood. Since they couldn’t move while being teleported, the others would definitely attack them. So, they had to work together. How? By protecting their teammates of course! While one of them was being teleported, the others had to protect that person. Only then could that person be teleported out safely.

As soon as he thought up to this point, Yang Ye could imagine how brutal this round would be.

There were 1,000 of them yet only 30 would advance! So, the competition would definitely be extremely intense.

There were 30 teleportation formations, and each could only teleport a single person. So, they definitely had to join forces. The top three of every group would definitely join forces, but what about the rest? They would join forces as well to fight against the top three of all the groups. Because only by dealing with the top three of all the groups would they finally have a chance to advance!

Of course, not all would join forces against the top three. After all, if all the demon beasts here joined forces against the teams made up of the top three from all ten groups, then those fellows would have no chance!

However, such a situation had occurred in the past. But it had only occurred because the top three from all ten groups were too strong.

It could be said that the top three from each of the ten groups were in comparatively greater danger, but they had the highest chance to advance to the next round. Because all of them were extremely strong. However, if they didn’t get help from anyone, then unless they could crush all the demon beasts here, it would be impossible for them to advance successfully through the teleportation formations!

Needless to say, this test which the demon beast had created was really not bad.

Unity!

The Demon Alliance wanted to teach the principle of unity to them. No matter how strong a person was, if one didn’t have the help of the entire clan or even race, then one’s individual strength may be useless. Unless a person was so strong that it was possible to crush everything without any help. Just like this very moment, if someone could defeat all 999 other demon beasts here, no demon beast would stop that person from advancing to the next round.

But was it possible?

The reason it was said that the second round would be very intense once it started was because many demon beasts were working together. But at the end of the round, they would split up once again into numerous smaller teams and start to fight each other. Simply speaking, in the end, only three from each group could advance to the next round, and if those three wanted to succeed, they would have to fight from the beginning until the end of the round.

Was it difficult?

Extremely!

Even Yang Ye felt a sense of pressure!

Even though he was strong, he wasn’t strong enough to fight hundreds on his own. He couldn’t accomplish that even if he could use his sword. After all, these demon beasts weren’t weaklings. While he could kill them in an instant if he used his sword, could he kill so many?

He had to know how to work together in the second ground!

Around 15 minutes later, a voice resounded, “Begin!”

As soon as the voice finished resounding, the demon beasts swiftly split apart and formed numerous smaller teams.

Even though no demon beast charged towards the teleportation formations, the atmosphere here was quite tense.

Yang Ye gazed at Man Shi, “What should we do now?”

Man Shi replied in a low voice, “Wait!”

Kuang Jing nodded, “If we try to take a teleportation formation right now, we’ll be besieged. Especially us because we’re the strongest team from our group. If we try to fight for the teleportation formations now, then they’ll join forces against us. But if we stay put, they wouldn’t dare to attack us. Because the first to attack us will be crushed!”

Yang Ye frowned, “Then how long do we have to wait?”

“It won’t be very long!” Man Shi continued, “Ten invulnerability talismans will appear in a while, and they can protect you for ten breaths of time. It’s what we must fight to obtain, and we must get one!”

Yang Ye frowned and was puzzled, “Invulnerability talismans?”

Man Shi explained, “Let me give you an example. The four of us are in this group. If you intend to go in and the three of us protect you, then what would the last person do? Who would protect him? So, the talisman is for that person.”

“Right!” Yang Ye nodded, “Then doesn’t that mean one can advance to the next round by obtaining one of those talismans?”

“In theory, yet!” Man Shi continued, “But it isn’t definite. Because if someone’s strength surpasses the limits of the talisman, then it would naturally fail. However, I presume no more than five here possess the strength to accomplish that, and based on their strength, it definitely won’t be so difficult for them to advance. Thus, the talismans can be considered as a permit, a permit to advance!”

Yang Ye was about to speak when the space in the sky shook abruptly, and then 10 rays of light suddenly flashed out from there and descended to the ground!

Man Shi spoke in a low voice, “The invulnerability talismans!”

Yang Ye was extremely swift. He instantly appeared in the sky and grabbed one of them.

Man Shi and the others weren’t happy when they witnessed this scene, and they were horrified instead. Man Shi hurriedly said, “Put it down right now!”

Yang Ye was stunned. Suddenly, he noticed that the gazes of all the demon beasts on the ground below had descended onto him.

The first to act would always bear the brunt of the attack!

Yang Ye finally came to an understanding!

He fell silent for an instant, and then he suddenly roared with fury, “What are you looking at? If you don’t like it.... What the heck!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye vanished on the spot because over 900 demon beasts charged at him.
