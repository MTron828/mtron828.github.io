Chapter 2064 – I Refuse!

As soon as Yang Ye left the mysterious ruins, he encountered Han Yi’s group.

Li Shui’shui and Wo You were there too.

Han Yi and the mothers surrounded Yang Ye, and they were just about to speak when they suddenly turned around. The mysterious ruins suddenly trembled, and then it started to turn ethereal before their eyes and gradually vanished.

It had vanished!

It had vanished right before them, and it hadn’t left even a trace behind!

Meanwhile, a man suddenly asked, “Young Brother Yang, what did you see in there?”

All of them restrained their thoughts and gazed at Yang Ye. Obviously, they were very curious because Yang Ye had been in there for so long and had come out alive.

Yang Ye smiled, “It wasn’t much. I just encountered a demon beast, fought it, and then fled.”

The man spoke indifferently, “That’s all?”

Yang Ye gazed at the man, “What else?”

The man looked Yang Ye in the eyes, “Young Brother Yang, did you not find anything in there? Like… like Originite?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “I didn’t.”

The man’s voice was slightly cold, “Really?”

Yang Ye walked closer to the man and said, “If I’m to be honest, not to mention that I didn’t find any, but even if I did, what can you do? Kill me and take it? Why don’t you try?”

The man’s expression instantly became quite unsightly.

Yang Ye ignored him and turned around with the intent to leave. Meanwhile, Li Shui’shui and Wo You hurriedly followed him.

“Young Brother Yang!” Han Yi suddenly smiled, “Anyway, congratulations.”

Yang Ye glanced at Han Yi and said, “All of you fled so damn quickly when there was danger. Who can you blame for that?”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye transformed into a ray of light that vanished into the distant sky, and Li Shui’shui and Wo You quickly followed after him.

Han Yi looked up into the sky with a calm expression on his face, and no one knew what he was thinking.

Meanwhile, a few powerful auras came from the other side of the sky, and they were approaching rapidly.

Han Yi spoke softly, “The four clans and Martial Emperor Academy… They came in the end!”

The man who spoke earlier seemed quite nervous, and he asked, “Brother Han, shall we flee?”

Han Yi smiled, “Why? We just have to tell them the truth. In any case, we didn’t get anything!”

…

Martial Emperor City.

Once he returned to the city, Yang Ye ignored Li Shui’shui and Wo You, and he just went straight for the library.

“Yang Ye!’ Suddenly, Li Shui’shui appeared in front of Yang Ye. She looked him in the eyes and asked, “What did you get in there?”

“Shui’shui!” Meanwhile, Wo You suddenly pulled Li Shui’shui behind her, and she gazed at Yang Ye with eyes filled with vigilance.

Yang Ye glanced at them and vanished into the distance.

Wo You heaved a sigh of relief when she saw Yang Ye leave.

Li Shui’shui was quite confused, “Wo You, what is it?”

Wo You turned around and gazed at her, “You’re such an idiot. When he encountered danger, none of us lent him a hand. If you were him, would you have a good impression of us? Of course you wouldn’t. yet now, we’re asking for what he obtained there.”

Her voice was low at this point, “Didn’t you sense it? He wanted to kill as soon as he emerged from there. That was why Han Yi didn’t dare to ask him anything. Because Han Yi was very well aware that he would go berserk. Once he did go berserk, he would definitely annihilate everyone there!”

Li Shui’shui’s lips moved slightly. She wanted to say something but didn’t in the end.

Wo You continued, “If we helped him there, it would be a show of loyalty, but if we didn’t, it is our right not to. So, he can’t blame us for not helping him. However, we can’t ask about what he obtained there or try to get it. Of course, it’s mainly because we don’t have the strength to do so. If you cover someone else’s possessions when you don’t have sufficient strength, it’s no different than courting death!”

Li Shui’shui spoke softly, “I understand!”

Wo You looked off into the distance, “He definitely got something in there, and that’s his fortuitous encounter but trouble as well. I think it won’t be long before someone comes looking for him!”

…

Yang Ye returned to the library, and he just casually found a place to sit down in there. Meanwhile, Tian Xiu emerged from the Primordial Pagoda. Now, she was looking after the library for him while he naturally planned to take at the Inheritance Stone he’d acquired.

Tian Xiu gazed at Yang Ye for not too far away, and then she sized up the surroundings. In the end, she sat before the stone table. There was a sword on the table, and it was the Sword Supreme.

Tian Xiu sat on the stone stool while shaking her legs lightly. She glanced at Yang Ye from time to time but didn’t look straight at him.

In the Primordial Pagoda.

Yang Ye gazed at the crystalline and translucent stone before him. He just looked at it for a long time before tapping it lightly. As soon as he tapped it, the stone exploded apart, and the scene before him changed.

This world before him was of seven colors, and it emanated a seven colored glow.

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings. Suddenly, an ethereal figure appeared before him. It walked close to him, but Yang Ye still couldn’t discern its appearance, and he could only see a blurry figure!

Suddenly, five pillars of light appeared around the figure. They were fiery red, aqua blue, earthen brown… Yang Ye immediately came to an understanding at this point.

It was the energy of the five elements!

The five elements filled the world!

He’d come into contact with the five elements in the past, and he knew a little about it.

Meanwhile, the five pillars of energy suddenly started spinning.

“Are they going to merge?” Yang Ye frowned slightly. Merging the five elements wasn’t anything special. Because he’d done so in the past. While it was quite strong, it wasn’t very attractive to him.

Suddenly, the scene around Yang Ye changed.

At this moment, he was on a bed of flowers. The flowers were extremely gorgeous and had clearly just bloomed. But just a moment later, the scene gradually changed, and the flowers turned golden, and then gradually dropped…

An instant later, the temperature turned icy cold, and the flower bed was covered in a thick layer of snow.

Just like that, the surroundings kept changing incessantly.

In the end, Yang Ye figured it out.

The four seasons!

It was the four seasons that were cycling before him.

Yang Ye seemed to have thought of something, and he suddenly gazed at the figure. The figure was still there, and the five types of energy around the figure were still spinning. As they spun, the scene before him was changing incessantly!

Yang Ye came to a slight understanding at this point.

The energy of the five elements wasn’t just limited to being merged together, they could change. Changing the five elements was equivalent to changing the world. It was a concept that sounded quite exaggerated, but it could change everything within a certain scope!

It wasn’t destruction or creation, it was modification! It was the usage of the five elements to modify!

A smile curled up on the corners of Yang Ye’s mouth.

The Sword Domain!

Yang Ye had comprehended the Sword Domain, so once he grasped this ability and used it within the Sword Domain, how terrifying would it be? After all, he possessed absolute control over the world within the Sword Domain!

The Sword Domain was like a world of its own, and if he grasped this technique, he could change that world. Not only would he be able to change it, he could use it too…

Many different possibilities came to Yang Ye’s mind. Perhaps it wasn’t the same as what the figure was trying to display, but it didn’t matter. Yang Ye had never intended to fully learn and follow another’s technique. The reminder he’d received from the figure had allowed him to return to the development of the Sword Domain once more.

The Sword Domain could be improved incessantly, but he didn’t have a direction in the past. Yet now, he had one.

Yang Ye immediately put his ideas into action. He closed his eyes, and the scene around him returned to normal while the crystalline and translucent stone fell down in front of him. As he gazed at the stone, a smile curled up on the corners of his mouth. He took it in his grasp and took a step forward.

The Sword Domain!

At this moment, an area of 500m around him had been enveloped within his Sword Domain.

After that, Yang Ye started his training.

In the beginning, there were fluctuations of energy in the Sword Domain, and the space within the Sword Domain gradually started to tremble and was extremely unstable.

Boom!

Suddenly, the space within the Sword Domain exploded apart, and a mouthful of blood sprayed from Yang Ye. At the same time, his figure was blasted over 10km away.

Yang Ye naturally didn’t give up. He stood up again and continued!

…

In the library, Tian Xiu held the black scroll in her hands and was ceaselessly flipping through it. Suddenly, she looked up because a man had walked in.

The man glanced at the surroundings and said, “Where’s the librarian?”

Tian Xiu leaped off her stool and spoke softly, “What do you need?”

The man spoke with astonishment, “You’re the librarian?”

Tian Xiu shook her head, “My big brother is. He’s busy and away, so I’m here helping him.”

The man sized up Tian Xiu. Suddenly, his gaze descended onto the Sword Supreme on the table. It didn’t take long for a wisp of surprise to flash through his eyes, and it gradually turned to shock.

A short while later, he withdrew his gaze and looked at Tian Xiu. He grinned, “Little Sister, can you sell that sword of yours to me?”

Tian Xiu shook her head. She was about to speak when the man picked up the sword and tossed two immortal crystals to her, “Deal!”

Tian Xiu was stunned and said, “I’m not selling it!”

“You’re not?” The man chuckled, “It’s too late. It’s mine now. Moreover, you agreed to it!”

Tian Xiu almost cried, “I… I didn’t agree!”

Yang Ye had given it to her to keep herself safe, so Yang Ye would definitely be angry if someone took it.

If Big Brother gets angry and doesn’t want me… Tian Xiu grew even more anxious.

As for the man, he smiled spuriously. Suddenly, he grabbed Tian Xiu by the throat and lifted her up, “Little Sister, this sword is mine now, right?”

Tian Xiu’s face had turned purple while her eyes seemed to be almost popping out of their sockets. She couldn’t speak, but she still tried hard to shake her head…
