“You’ll be giving your life away if you head over in your current state!“ The Sword Spirit stood in his path and pointed at him, “Your internal organs have moved from their right positions, and they are even damaged. Moreover, practically all your profound energy has been exhausted. How will you avenge Xiaoman if you return now?”

“I refuse to leave just like that!” Yang Ye clenched his fists. Every time he thought about how Xiaoman died for him caused him to feel like something was about to charge out from within him. It was killing intent, and it was rage as well.

The Sword Spirit said, “I know that, but you should let your body recover even if you want to take revenge, right?”

Yang Ye took a deep breath, suppressed the killing intent and rage in his heart, and said, “You’re right. I can’t be impulsive. The most important thing is to recover for now. Only by recovering to my peak would I have a chance to avenge Xiaoman.”

Yang Ye blasted the nearby lava away and sat cross-legged in midair before he withdrew some extreme-grade energy stones to start recuperating.

A ray of light flashed. The 2 Half-Saint Sword Servants appeared in front of Yang Ye, but they weren’t on their feet.

The Sword Spirit said, “They suffered that red haired old man’s attack just now. While they haven’t been completely destroyed, they are heavily injured, and they won’t be able to fight for some time. What I’m trying to say is that the red haired old man is very strong, and you might not be able to escape with such ease next time.”

Yang Ye said, “But if I leave just like that, then what about taking avenge for Xiaoman? It’s never too late for a noble man to take revenge. But I’m no noble man. I’m a petty person. I want to take revenge as soon as possible!”

She replied, “But you don’t have the strength to do that right now!”

Yang Ye said, “Who says that I don’t? I admit that I really can’t fight them in a frontal assault, but what if I launched sneak attacks?”

The Sword Spirit replied in a low voice, “You might die!” Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“But have you thought about how... Xiaoman is already dead!?” said Yang Ye.

The Sword Spirit gazed at Yang Ye for a short while, and then she waved her hand. The spatial rings worn by the 2 Half-Saints instantly flew over to her palm, and she said, “There are a total of 10 1,000 year old Firecrystals within their spatial rings. It should be helpful to you.”

“I was too impatient earlier and forget about their spatial rings!” Yang Ye took the rings and glanced at their contents. Besides 10 1,000 year old Firecrystals, there were many other Firecrystals scattered within them. All of the Firecrystals were over 100 years old, and some were even around 500 years old.

“Absorbing the energy within these Firecrystals is sufficient for you to attain the fifth rank of the Monarch Realm!” She said, “However, I don’t recommend that you do that. Because your mental state wouldn’t be able to keep up, and the rise of your cultivation will cause huge latent problems to appear within you. You can choose to advance to the second rank of the Monarch Realm for now, and then slowly accumulate your strength for your next advancement. Once you’ve gained a certain level of experience and strength, you can absorb another 1,000 year old Firecrystal to charge into the next rank.”

“Alright!” Yang Ye swallowed one of the 1,000 year old Firecrystals, and then started to absorb the energy emanated from it.

...

One day later.

Yang Ye suddenly opened his eyes, and then explosive cracking resounded like firecrackers throughout his entire body.

“I’m finally at the second rank of the Monarch Realm!” Yang Ye took a deep breath, and then he glanced at the 2 Half-Saint Sword Servants who stood before him. Their injuries were almost completely healed now because he’d allowed them to absorb a 1,000 year old Firecrystal each. Not only had they recovered with the help of the 1,000 year old Firecrystal, they were even slightly stronger!

Meanwhile, the Sword Spirit suddenly spoke, “I’ve finished refining Guardian Lin’s corpse. You can take control of him now!”

Yang Ye nodded in response.

...

The Fire Spirit Race.

At this moment, its defenses were much more relaxed because their Patriarch had emerged from his closed door cultivation.

A group of profounders from the Fire Spirit Race were gathered in a room, and they were discussing something.

“I heard the Patriarch killed Yang Ye with a single slap of his palm! What a pity! The Patriarch should have captured him, extracted his soul, and sealed his soul beneath the ground. That way, he would suffer being burned all day and night, and living would be worse than death!”

“That damnable bitch, Xiaoman, should suffer the same fate! It was all her fault! If she didn’t bring that madman back to our territory, our race wouldn’t have lost so many people at all. Elder Qian killed that damnable bitch just like that. She really got off easily. She should have had her soul extracted and tortured as well!”

“Both of them deserve death! Especially that bitch, Xiaoman! My older brother wouldn’t have been killed by Yang Ye if it wasn’t for her! That damnable bitch really deserves death! All of them deserve death!”

“It’s not like we don’t have the opportunity to take revenge!” Suddenly, a voice resounded from the side.

They looked over to the source of the voice.

“Qian Mei? Zhiqing?” Someone exclaimed with surprise.

Qian Mei and Zhiqing walked over to them, and then Qian Mei spoke coldly, “Yes, Yang Ye is a monstrous genius, and he was very strong. But so what? Wasn’t he still smacked to death by the Patriarch? Even though he’s dead, he still has a younger sister and wives on Profounder Continent!”

Zhiqing glanced at Qian Mei while her brows knit together slightly, but she didn’t say anything. Because only she and Qian Mei knew that Yang Ye was actually alive. The reason they said he was dead was merely because they wanted to calm the rage of the Fire Spirit Race’s members.

“Profounder Continent?” One of them frowned, “Qian Mei, are you talking about that abandoned place”

Qian Mei nodded and said, “I’ve investigated and found out that he has a younger sister and wives at the abandoned place. If we were to capture those loved ones of his, and then torture and humiliate them to death. Don’t you think that Yang Ye wouldn’t be able to rest in peace?” She was filled with both terror and hatred towards Yang Ye because she’d suffered unprecedented humiliation from him.

So long as Yang Ye was still alive, she would never be able to be at ease!

“Alright! We’ll make his younger sister and women live in disgrace. No, we must make everyone related to him suffer inhumane torture and make Yang Ye unable to rest in peace!”

“Come, let’s head to Profounder Continent....”

“All of you won’t have the chance to do that!” Suddenly, a voice resounded. Xu Zhiqing reacted very quickly, and she was horrified as she roared furiously, “It’s Yang Ye! He’s back! Everyone....”

It was too late because a ray of light flashed....

It was swift, extremely swift. It was simply swift to the point it seemed like it was an illusion.

The bodies of a few dozen members of the Fire Spirit Race stiffened on the spot.

Hiss!

Their heads instantly flew into the air while fountains of blood sprayed from their necks....

“AHHH!!!” Qian Mei was stunned, and then a shrill cry of extreme horror resounded from her.

Meanwhile, a figure appeared in front of her.

“You....” She was just about to say something, but only an instant passed before her voice stopped abruptly.

The figure vanished, and a slight breeze brushed by from the figure’s movement, causing Qian Mei’s head to roll off her neck....

In next to no time, only Xu Zhiqing remained here.

A ray of light shot extremely swiftly towards her. However, it suddenly changed its trajectory and shot towards the left.

Only an instant passed before the ray of light vanished, and then 3 old men appeared there.

It was the red haired old man, Qian Yan, and the Grand Elder.

The red haired old man glanced at the surroundings, and a wisp of rage flashed through his eyes as he gazed at the corpses which covered the ground. He said, “Good! Very good! I really underestimated how brave you are! Not only have you not fled, you even attacked my Fire Spirit Race again! Good! Very good indeed!”

“His aura has vanished!” said the Grand Elder in a low voice.

“Qian Mei!” Suddenly, a furious howl that sounded like the roar of a wild beast resounded.

Qian Yan’s entire body trembled violently as he gazed at Qian Mei’s headless corpse, and then a violent and vicious aura surged out from within him.

“Yang Ye! I’ll kill you! I’ll definitely kill you! I’ll definitely kill you!!” Qian Yan’s voice resounded throughout the surroundings, and then he transformed into a ray of fiery light that shot towards the distance.

“Patriarch!” A wisp of worry flashed through the Grand Elder’s eyes when he saw Qian Yan act like a madman.

“Follow him!” said the old man.

The Grand Elder nodded, and then he hurriedly chased after Qian Yan.

“Grandpa, he... he’s too strong!” Meanwhile, Xu Zhiqing spoke abruptly. She’d practically been unable to react before everyone around her including Qian Mei were killed just now. Moreover, she would have probably perished as well if the red haired old man and the others hadn’t arrived on time. Because she didn’t have any confidence in being able to resist that ray of light which was shot at her.

“He’s really not bad!” The old man said, “Qian Yan was really wrong this time. He really shouldn’t have killed Xiaoman and offended that fellow, Yang Ye, because of his own selfish motives. Our Fire Spirit Race has lost more people in this incident than it has in the last 100 years.”

Xu Zhiqing said, “I’ve utilized the joint intelligence network to investigate him. He’s a madman, a complete and utter madman. He always annihilated all his enemies, and he usually does it while disregarding the consequences. With his character, he wouldn’t hesitate to do as he said and slaughter our entire race if he had the ability.”

“He won’t have the chance!” The red haired old man closed his eyes slightly and said, “Send my orders for the other 4 Guardians to abandon their current tasks and return immediately!”

“The seniors are suppressing the defiant profounders....” Xu Zhiqing hesitated and said, “If they return now, then the Hallowed Halls will definitely....”

“I’ll deal with the Hallowed Halls!” said the old man.

Xu Zhiqing suddenly said, “Grandpa, even your strength isn’t sufficient to deal with that fellow, Yang Ye?”

The old man replied, “He’ll definitely die in a head-on battle. However, I’m not his current target, and the other Half-Saints aren’t as well. His current targets are the ordinary profounders of our race. Moreover, a supreme expert has executed a secret technique on him to conceal his aura, so even I can’t sense his aura!”

“AHH!!” Suddenly, a miserable and shrill cry resounded from afar.

It was Qian Yan’s voice!

The old man’s expression changed slightly as his figure flashed and vanished on the spot.
