Chapter 1108 – Take This!

“A sword of slaughter at the Emperor Rank....” The voice in the sky carried a trace of solemness in it, “Looks like I underestimated you. However, aren’t you being a little too childish if you think that you’ll be able to disregard my Thousand Crane Sect by relying on a sword.”

As soon as the voice finished speaking, Hua Mujin suddenly shot towards Yang Ye.

“Slash!” Yang Ye waved his right hand, and then a ray of blood red sword energy instantly shot out from the blood red sword in his grasp.

Bang!

An explosion resounded, and then Hua Mujin was blasted almost 3km back. There was a small blue shield in front of her chest, and it had cracked apart completely.

It was a high-grade Divine Rank shield!

Hua Mujin was slightly stunned. She stretched out her hand to touch it lightly, and the small shield instantly transformed into powder.

Yang Ye paid no attention to Hua Mujin. He waved his right hand, and the Sword Servants in the surroundings instantly returned into the ancient sheath. After that, he wrapped his left arm around Xiao Yuxi’s waist and transformed into a ray of blood red light that shot towards the sky.

Ding Lin who’d been restrained by Yang Ye’s Sword Servants until now immediately heaved a sigh of relief when she witnessed this scene. She sat weakly on the ground and gazed resentfully at Yang Ye’s figure, “I’ll make living worse than death for....”

Suddenly, a ray of blood red sword energy shot down from the sky and instantly entered Ding Lin’s head. Her entire body exploded into pieces and blood sprayed in all directions!

“How dare you!” The voice in the sky rumbled like thunder, and then a palm tore through space and clawed at Yang Ye. The huge palm was extremely swift, and it instantly caught up to them and intended to claw them into powder.

A wisp of ferocity flashed through Yang Ye’s clear right eye when he sensed the approaching attack, and he turned around and drew his sword swiftly. A ray of blood red sword energy instantly swept out and slammed against the huge palm.

Bang!

The huge palm shook violently before exploding apart in midair. In an instant, a terrifying storm of energy swept towards the surroundings. Meanwhile, Yang Ye held Xiao Yuxi in his arm as his figure flashed towards the distance.

“Don’t you dare!” A furious howl resounded from the sky, and then a ray of light flashed down from above. It didn’t take long for Yang Ye to stop because a woman had appeared not too far away from him. She seemed to be only around the age of 20. She wore a white dress, had a beautiful appearance, and she emanated a naturally dignified aura.

Xiao Yuxi spoke softly, “Thousand Crane Sect’s current Vice Sect Master, Qian Wenlan. The sect master is in closed door cultivation, so she’s in-charge of the sect.”

Qian Wenlan glanced at Xiao Yuxi, and then she gazed at Yang Ye, “An Emperor Rank sword and Void Rank sword intent. Who are you!”

“White Deer Academy! Yang Ye!” replied Yang Ye. It wasn’t something he needed to conceal, and he couldn’t conceal it either.

“White Deer Academy!” Qian Wenlan’s eyes narrowed slightly, “You’re that Yang Ye who defeated the Director of the Law Faction, Xu Fan, and remained undefeated in an intense battle with Feng Qingyi?” As the vice master of a sect, she naturally knew what had appeared in White Deer Academy. So, Yang Ye’s name wasn’t unfamiliar to her. Or it should be said that it wasn’t unfamiliar to any power near White Deer Dimension.

Not to mention anything else, just Yang Ye’s ability to remain undefeated in battle with Feng Qingyi was sufficient to make Diamond Rank powers take him seriously.

“Yes!” Yang Ye looked Qian Wenlan in the eyes, and the slaughter intent he emanated was still surging, “I just want to take Yuxi with me right now.”

“What do you think my Thousand Crane Sect is?” Qian Wenlan clenched her right fist slowly, “Is this your backyard? You think you can come and go as you please? Yang Ye, I don’t care who you are. You snuck into my Thousand Crane Sect, killed an elder of my sect, and took a disciple of my sect as prisoner. Let me tell you that even Xiao Bieli won’t be able to save you!”

“Then let’s fight!” As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye suddenly swung his sword, and a ray of blood red sword energy instantly arrived in front of Qian Wenlan.

“You’re courting death! A ray of cold light flashed through her eyes, and she swiftly slammed her fist forward. A blue colored energy fist flashed forward and instantly collided with Yang Ye’s sword energy.

Bang!

Both shook violently, and it didn’t take long for Yang Ye’s sword energy to shatter. But just a moment passed before a ray of sword energy that was enhanced by Void Rank slaughter intent and sword intent arrived before the fist and slammed against it. The blue fist was instantly torn apart, and the sword energy didn’t slow down at all as it shot towards Qian Wenlan.

Suddenly, Qian Wenlan transformed into a ray of blue light that collided with Yang Ye’s blood red sword energy. The sword energy froze for a moment, and then it was obliterated. At the same time, the ray of blue light arrived in front of Yang Ye.

Yang Ye’s expression changed slightly, and he immediately pushed Xiao Yuxi away. At the same time, the ancient sheath appeared in his left grasp. He sheathed Heaven’s Gravestone within the ancient sheath before drawing it swiftly!

Om!

A beam of blood red light shot forward from within the ancient sheath!

It was 110 overlapped Heavenrends!

The beam of blood red light collided with the blue light, and then a deafening explosion resounded throughout the sky. A monstrous wave of energy instantly suffused the sky.

The sound of sword howls and intense collisions resounded incessantly from within the wave of energy, and the entire sky was trembling violently at this moment.

Everyone watched this scene with disbelief.

They hadn’t imagined that Yang Ye could actually fight Qian Wenlan. After all, he was only a Half-Saint while she was a Quasi Emperor!

After all, there was a huge gap between their cultivations!

Bang!

A loud explosion resounded in the sky, and then the ray of blue light and red slight split apart. Besides that, the waves of energy in the sky had dispersed as well.

Qian Wenlan’s face was absolutely gloomy right now, and strands of violet aura were surging incessantly from her. She’d thought that she could deal with Yang Ye in a few moves, but after fighting him for a while, she noticed that while Yang Ye was in a disadvantaged position, he could fight her. Moreover, she had to be careful because the slightest mistake might cause her to suffer an injury from his sword energy!

Two types of sharp and fierce Void Rank intent were entirely capable of posing a threat to her!

Yang Ye held the ancient sheath tightly in his left grasp, and Heaven’s Gravestone was sheathed in it while his right hand held its hilt. Strands of slaughter intent and evil energy were surging incessantly from him. At the same time, the Heart of Slaughter within him was thumping rapidly, and the intent to kill and do evil surged out incessantly from him like a torrent!

Yang Ye’s clothes were gone, and his body had over a dozen injuries on it. Every single injury was a few centimeters deep, and every one of them was bleeding. However, his blood had just left his body when it was instantly absorbed by the blood red sword sheathed in the ancient sheath. Yang Ye was holding tightly onto the sword’s hilt with his right hand, and his entire right arm was tense. Numerous veins had bulged up like tiny snakes on his right arm, and it made him seem quite ferocious.

“Needless to say, I really underestimated you!” Qian Wenlan stared fixedly at him and said, “White Deer Academy lost the Law Faction and Feng Qingyi, but it gained you. Their luck really isn’t bad. Unfortunately, they shouldn’t have let you come to my Thousand Crane Sect.”

Yang Ye’s eyes were closed tight, and his body had started to tremble, “Let us leave!”

“Let you leave?” She laughed coldly, “You must die today. Otherwise, wouldn’t my Thousand Crane Sect become the laughingstock of the world/”

As soon as she finished speaking, a beam of blue light suddenly surged out from her, and it instantly arrived in front of Yang Ye.

Yang Ye suddenly opened his eyes, and then 2 rays of blood red sword energy shot out from his eyes and smashed against the beam of blue light.

Bang!

A loud explosion resounded as Yang Ye drew his sword and swung it swiftly!

Om!

A sword howl resounded as a beam of blood red sword energy flashed.

120 overlapped Heavenrends!

It was Yang Ye’s present limit!

Qian Wenlan’s pupils constricted slightly when she saw the sword energy, and there was a solemn expression in her eyes. She swiftly slapped her palms forward, and a blue barrier of light swept out and slammed against the sword energy.

Bang! VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

A loud explosion resounded, and then Qian Wenlan was blasted over 5km away.

Yang Ye didn’t pursue her. His figure flashed over to Xiao Yuxi, and he took her in his arm before shooting towards the distance. He was very swift, and it only took him an instant to be almost out of the Thousand Crane Sect.

Suddenly, a ray of white light erupted from outside the sect, and then Yang Ye collided against it. The white light shook violently while Yang Ye was blasted back.

“It’s an offensive formation!” Xiao Yuxi spoke softly.

As soon as Xiao Yuxi finished speaking, another pillar of white light appeared out of nowhere and shot towards them.

Yang Ye’s pupils constricted slightly as he swung the blood red sword in his right grasp. A ray of blood red sword energy shot forward, but it hadn’t been able to stop the pillar of white light. Yang Ye’s expression changed slightly and hurriedly pulled Xiao Yuxi behind him.

Bang!

A loud explosion resounded as Yang Ye and Xiao Yuxi were pushed over 3km back, and they were within the Thousand Crane Sect again.

“I said that you must die today!” As soon as Yang Ye’s figure stopped, a voice resounded from afar. Yang Ye turned around and saw that it was Qian Wenlan.

Yang Ye closed his eyes slightly, and it didn’t take long for the slaughter intent to surge back into his body. In next to no time, Yang Ye had returned to normal, but blood was seeping out incessantly from the corner of his mouth while his body itself was covered in injuries.

Qian Wenlan laughed coldly when she saw him put Heaven’s Gravestone away, “What? You intend to surrender?”

“So you refuse to let me leave, huh?” Yang Ye pulled Xiao Yuxi behind him, and then started walking towards Qian Wenlan. At the same time, he clenched his right fist slowly, and it didn’t take long for the veins throughout his right arm to bulge up as if his arm was about to explode. Meanwhile, the space around Yang Ye actually started to tremble violently while numerous arm-thick cracks swept towards the surroundings with Yang Ye at the center. In an instant, the cracks had spread to over 3km away.

Qian Wenlan’s expression changed drastically when she witnessed this scene!

Yang Ye stopped and said, “Take this!”
