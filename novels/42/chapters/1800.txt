Chapter 1801 – The Ying Clan’s Ancestor!

Peace!

Did the Ying Clan really want peace? Of course it didn’t. It didn’t want to seek peace, it had no choice but to seek peace. Because they couldn’t resist the joint forces of the Yang Clan and Wu Clan.

Just think about it, would the Ying Clan still seek peace if it had its previous strength?

Moreover, Yang Ye believed that even if he shook hands and made peace with the Ying Clan now, if the Ying Clan had an opportunity, it would definitely stab him in the back.

Benevolence!

In this world, there were many occasions that one couldn’t be benevolent. Because your benevolence may cause you and your clan to fall into a hopeless situation. Yang Ye absolutely refused to do something stupid like letting his enemies go and allowing them to look for trouble with him in the future.

Now, even if he had to pay a certain price, he intended to put an end to all future troubles.

Ying Yu stared at Yang Ye, “Yang Ye, I know that my Ying Clan is weak right now, but if we fight you to the death, you’ll suffer huge losses. So, that isn’t beneficial to anyone. We….”

“Cut the crap!” Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly raised his sword and pointed it at Ying Yu, “I’m here to fight you to the death.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he stomped his right foot down, and his figure transformed into a ray of light that shot towards Ying Yu.

Ying Yu and Ying Qing’s faces became extremely unsightly at the sight of this. Yang Ye was like a complete madman and couldn’t be negotiated with at all!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye’s sword had arrived.

Ying Yu didn’t have the time to think about anything else. He restrained his thoughts, overlapped his palms, and slammed them forward.

Boom!

A wave of powerful force surged out from his palms, and it instantly slammed against Yang Ye’s sword energy.

Boom!

Suddenly, a loud explosion resounded, and then Ying Yu was blasted 300m away.

Yang Ye was about to attack again, but numerous experts appeared behind Ying Yu.

Some of them were from the Ying Clan, but most were from the other clans. They were led by the patriarchs of the Lu Clan, Li Clan, Qin Clan, and Wang Clan.

The patriarchs were no fools. They naturally understood that if Yang Ye crushed the Ying Clan, then it would definitely be their turn soon. So, they had to stay united as it was the only way to fight Yang Ye!

Meanwhile, Ying Yu gazed at Yang Lianshuang, “Yang Lianshuang, even though our five clans are much inferior than before, our joint forces are something that can cause you serious losses even if we can’t win the battle.”

He glanced at Wu Ye and continued, “Besides our eight clans, there are other hidden powers in this medium universe. Once all our clans suffer heavy losses, it’ll only benefit others!”

He didn’t try to negotiate with Yang Ye because he knew that it was utterly pointless. Would Yang Ye consider all of that? No! Yang Ye would never consider that. As far as he was concerned, Yang Ye was a rash fellow!

Wu Ye hesitated for a moment and gazed at Yang Lianshuang, but Yang Lianshuang gazed at Yang Ye, “What do you think?”

Ying Yu’s expression instantly turned unsightly when he saw this.

Yang Ye glanced at Ying Yu’s group, “You’ll take us down with you? If it was in the past, your coalition did have the strength to do that. But now, you don’t. Of course, it’s pointless even if you do have the strength to do that. After all, if we don’t fight you to the death now, we’ll suffer worse losses once your clans have recuperated!”

His profound energy started to surge madly as he spoke, “Cut the crap. Either your clans will vanish from the face of this world today, or our Yang Clan and Wu Clan will vanish.” He stomped his foot down and vanished on the spot.

Ying Yu had a fierce expression on his face, “Since that’s the case, let’s all die together! Kill!”

He vanished on the spot once he finished speaking.

At the same time, Heaven Desolation City shook violently, and then numerous beams of light shot up into the sky towards Yang Ye and the others.

The formation!

Wu Ye and the others’ expressions became quite solemn when they witnessed this. Every single clan had its own defensive formation. They were a huge threat to True Realm experts. Their side had an advantage before this, but as soon as the Ying Clan activated the formation, their advantage had vanished.

But at this moment, they clearly couldn’t retreat.

Yang Lianshuang gazed at Nether Maiden and An Nanjing who stood by her side, “We’ll stop them. The two of you head down there and destroy the formation, alright?”

They nodded, and then they immediately shot down towards the city.

Meanwhile, Ying Yu who was fighting Yang Ye hurriedly shouted, “Stop them!”

As soon as he gave the order, Lu Yuntian and Ying Qing charged at An Nanjing and Nether Maiden. Nether Maiden was about to counterattack when An Nanjing suddenly said, “You go, I’ll stop them!”

Nether Maiden glanced at An Nanjing and didn’t say a word. She immediately turned around and charged downwards.

Ying Qing’s expression changed. He was about to chase after Nether Maiden, but a spear, or to be more precise, half a spear suddenly tore through space and arrived in front of him. The powerful energy it carried caused Ying Qing’s expression to change. He didn’t dare act carelessly and hurriedly stopped before slamming his fist forward!

Boom!

An explosion resounded, and Ying Qing was blasted 300m away. An Nanjing didn’t follow up with another attack, and she shot over to Lu Yuntian instead. After that, she stabbed the partial spear at him.

Lu Yuntian had witnessed her strength, so he didn’t dare to act carelessly at all when facing it. He flipped his palm, and a spear similarly appeared in his grasp, and then he stabbed it forward.

Boom!

Lu Yuntian was blasted over 300m away!

An Nanjing held half a spear in each of her hands, and then she looked up at Lu Yuntian and Ying Qing, “Passage isn’t allowed!”

Ying Qing and Lu Yuntian exchanged glances, and then they vanished on the spot. At the same time they vanished, An Nanjing vanished too.

Just like that, the three of them entered into combat.

Even though Ying Qing and Lu Yuntian were 5th stage True Realm experts, An Nanjing wasn’t disadvantaged at all while fighting both of them! Conversely, both of them grew more and more shocked as the battle went on. Because even the slightest carelessness from them may cause them to be killed by her!

An Nanjing’s instinct in combat was truly terrifying!

Meanwhile in midair, even though the quality of experts from the Ying Clan couldn’t compare to the experts on the Yang Clan’s side, they were barely able to resist the Yang Clan’s forces by relying on the formation on Heaven Desolation Continent. But this didn’t go on for long.

Around 15 minutes later.

Boom!

A loud explosion resounded from the city, and then the huge barrier of light around the city dimmed down before vanishing into thin air.

The formation was destroyed!

The expressions of the experts from the Ying Clan turned unsightly. They weren’t the only ones, the experts from the other clans had unsightly expressions on their faces too. Now that they’d lost the formation, how would they resist Yang Ye’s group?

Meanwhile, Yang Lianshuang gazed at Ying Yu and the others, “The Ying Clan will be eliminated today!”

As soon as she finished speaking, she charged forward with Wu Ye and the others.

Suddenly, Ying Yu roared with fury, “Summon our ancestor!”

Boom!

A huge circular platform of light suddenly shot up into the air. An instant later, it arrived in midair, and then it shook slightly while the figure of a middle aged man in a luxurious robe appeared on the platform.

The Ying Clan’s ancestor!

Everyone stopped fighting.

Yang Lianshuang and the others had quite solemn expressions on their faces. Even though it was just a strand of soul, the Ying Clan’s ancestor couldn’t be underestimated. After all, the Yang Clan’s ancestor had been able to instantly annihilate around 30 True Realm experts that day!

Such existences had surpassed the 6th stage of the True Realm!

The experts from the Ying Clan heaved sighs of relief when they saw the middle aged man. Even Ying Yu’s expression eased up. Actually, he didn’t really want to use the Ying Clan’s final trump card. Because it could only be used once!

However, he knew that if he didn’t use it, the Ying Clan may really be annihilated.

At this moment, the Ying Clan was in a truly hopeless situation!

The middle aged man glanced at the surroundings, and it didn’t take long for his eyes to become clear. In the end, his gaze descended onto Ying Yu, “I didn’t expect the Ying Clan to decline to such an extent.” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Ying Yu and the others’ instantly felt quite embarrassed. Ying Yu bowed respectfully to the middle aged man and said, “Forgive us for bringing shame to you, Ancestor.”

The middle aged man shook his head slightly, “It’s fine. If something thrives, it will also decline. There is no clan that can thrive and prosper forever.”

As he spoke, he turned to look at Yang Ye and Yang Lianshuang. After he glanced at them, he glanced at An Nanjing, Nether Maiden, and the others. A solemn expression gradually appeared in his eyes.

There were too many geniuses here!

A moment of silence ensued, and then the middle aged man’s gaze descended onto Yang Ye and Yang Lianshuang, “Since it has come to this, I presume what I say won’t matter. So, make your move. Let me see how strong the current geniuses of the Yang Clan are!”

Yang Ye gazed at Yang Lianshuang, “Are you going to do it, or shall I?”

She replied, “You’re the man here, so you do it!”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.
