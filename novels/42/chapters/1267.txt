Chapter 1268 – Isn’t It Just 3 Voiders?

He was naturally incapable of fighting 3 Voiders on his own, but if it was just one.... Would he even need to fear that Voider?

Yang Ye would naturally not hold back against a Voider. So, he utilized the ultimate version of Death by a Thought as soon as he attacked. He was a Quasi Emperor now while his body had attained the Epoch Realm, so the ultimate version of Death by a Thought was countless times stronger than before. Because it was too swift, his figure even transformed into a blood red thread as it shot forward.

Everywhere it passed, space was torn open. But because the thread was so fine, the tear in space was practically unnoticeable.

An instant later, Yang Ye and his sword arrived at the spot where space had rippled slightly, and his sword stabbed at that position.

Clang!

Yang Ye felt his sword tremble violently in his grasp while that expanse of space rippled rapidly as well. Suddenly, a blade that was thin as a cicada’s wings suddenly emerged from the space by Yang Ye’s head. It was extremely swift and instantly arrived at his right temple.

Yang Ye’s expression remained unchanged. He issued a command for the Phantom Shield to block the attack while he grabbed his sword with both hands and swung it forward.

Clang!

Hiss!

The Phantom Shield stopped the blade while the space in front of Yang Ye was slashed open. It didn’t take long for Yang Ye’s figure to appear around 30m away, but he had a solemn expression on his face. Because that Voider seemed to have vanished into thin air. That attack he executed had just been a complete waste of profound energy.

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings but the space here was completely calm. He didn’t sense any aura in his vicinity, nor did he sense anything else. But he had no doubt that the Voider was still here.

After a moment of hesitation, Yang Ye was about to release his Rebirth Rank sword intent. However, he suddenly looked up at the sky, and then he immediately transformed into a ray of light that entered the space before him. He was extremely far away when his figure appeared once more.

Not even 2 breaths of time later, the black robed old man and grey robed old man appeared where Yang Ye had been just moments ago.

The grey robed old man glanced at the surroundings and said, “Not only is that kid’s attainments in the sword extraordinary; his body is at the Epoch Realm. Besides that, he possesses a Void Rank sword of slaughter and a Void Rank defensive treasure. If I’m to be honest, your strength is probably insufficient to kill him. For the sake of avoiding any mishaps from occurring, please work together with us and don’t act on your own....”

The grey robed man suddenly stopped speaking at this point, and he had an unsightly expression on his face. Because the woman was gone.

The black robed old man shook his head, “Don’t be angry. Aren’t all the members of the Slayer Pavilion like that?”

The grey robed man spoke coldly, “They’re a bunch of conceited fellows! Even though that fellow, Yang Ye, is just a Quasi Emperor, if I’m to be frank, Yang Ye’s strength is much greater than hers. If she acts arbitrarily on her own, then the slightest mistake might bring about her death. Moreover, that fellow knows how to refine puppets. If he’s allowed to refine a Voider into a puppet, then we’ll have to pay an even greater price to kill him!”

The black robed old man fell silent for a short while before he said, “That fellow’s ability to conceal himself is formidable. So, we need her help. Otherwise, we might not even be able to catch a shadow of him. Let’s go after her. Don’t let her face him on her own or she might really be killed. We have to try our best to buy time until the members of the High Abyss Sect and Lin Clan arrive.”

The grey robed old man nodded, and then they vanished on the spot.

Around 100,000km away, Yang Ye had just emerged from within space when he instantly transformed into a ray of light that entered the space before him. Right after he vanished, the space in that area he was just standing on started to ripple, but it didn’t take long for the rippling to vanish.

Yang Ye had quite an unsightly expression on his face. Because he noticed that the enemy could follow him no matter how he fled. Even if he used the Sword Domain to conceal himself, that Voider could still follow him.

He knew that Voider was definitely using some sort of special method to lock onto him!

Now, he had to either kill that Voider or shake that Voider off. Otherwise, if this continued, then the situation he was in would grow progressively worse. Because he’d fought earlier and executed the Void Flash technique in succession, so he didn’t have much profound energy left. But his enemies were Voiders, so the amount of profound energy they had definitely far surpassed his reserves.

So, he had to either kill or get rid of that person!

If he wanted to kill that Voider, he had to improve his sword intent to the Quasi Returnal Rank with the help of the Sword God’s Seal. Otherwise, it would be utterly impossible for him to kill that Voider with a single attack. If he failed to kill that Voider in an instant, the other 2 old men would definitely catch up right away. At that time, not to mention killing, even escaping would be a problem for him!

But if he used the Sword God’s Seal, it represented that he would have to kill 3 Voiders at once. Because if he failed to annihilate all of them, then he could only wait for death to arrive once the backlash struck him.

Even if he used the Sword God’s Seal, he wasn’t confident in being able to kill 3 Voiders in an instant! After all, they were Voiders, not Emperors!

Yang Ye’s face was gloomy. He wasn’t using the Void Flash technique anymore, and he was just fleeing on his sword. It couldn’t be helped because the Void Flash technique consumed too much profound energy. If he continued utilizing it, then his profound energy would dry up. Even though he’d swallowed some violet crystals, the speed his profound energy recovered couldn’t keep up with the speed it was exhausted at!

So, he didn’t dare to utilize the Void Flash technique anymore!

After all, the Phantom Shield and sword intent required profound energy to be utilized. If he exhausted his profound energy, he would still be able to face a single Voider, but he would be dead if he had to face the joint forces of 3 Voiders!

He couldn’t defeat them in battle, nor could he escape them. This made Yang Ye have quite an unsightly expression on his face. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

He’d thought of returning to the Sword Alliance to get the black ape’s help, but if he led those 3 Voiders to the Sword Alliance, it would definitely be a calamity for the Sword Alliance. So, he had no choice but to deal with it himself!

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings before looking at the vast mountain range ahead. He didn’t hesitate to speed up and transform into a ray of light that entered the mountain range. Once he entered it, Yang Ye didn’t stop and sped up continuously. At the same time, his Rebirth Rank sword intent formed an invisible barrier around himself.

That expert who was following him possessed an extremely strange movement technique and could simply appear out of thin air, so he didn’t dare to act carelessly!

Suddenly, Yang Ye’s pupils constricted because a translucent throwing knife suddenly shot out from a tree on his right. The throwing knife wasn’t flying towards him, and it was shooting towards a spot in front of him. In other words, he would be struck by it if he continued forward.

It wasn’t thrown with the intent to kill him; it was thrown with the intent to stop him.

As soon as he figured it out, Yang Ye didn’t stop and sped up instead. Besides that, he’d commanded the Phantom Shield to block the throwing knife for him.

Clang!

The throwing knife was instantly stopped. Meanwhile, Yang Ye’s expression changed because the space before him rippled slightly, and then a practically translucent dagger swept at his throat. It was very swift, and it should be described as strange. Because the dagger seemed like it was formed from space, and it passed through his barrier of sword intent with ease. It hadn’t harmed his Rebirth Rank sword intent, and it had merely passed through the barrier of sword intent. It was like the barrier didn’t exist.

That wasn’t even the main point. The main point was that he finally understood his opponent’s true intentions. That throwing knife wasn’t there to stop him, it was there to draw away his Phantom Shield. Just like this very moment, his Phantom Shield couldn’t obstruct the dagger at all! Moreover, since he was caught off guard, he had no time to use his sword to stop the dagger. Because the dagger was already in front of his throat.

A wisp of ruthlessness flashed through Yang Ye’s eyes. He paid no attention to the dagger, and he stabbed his sword at the area of space before him instead!

He intended to kill and be killed!

The dagger stopped slightly before Yang Ye’s throat when its owner saw that Yang Ye had no intention to defend himself and intended to take her down with him, but just a moment passed before the dagger sped up and swept at Yang Ye’s throat.

Hiss! Hiss!

Yang Ye would naturally not give his life up to kill his enemy. He’d used his chin to clamp down on the dagger when it sliced his skin open, and a strand of blood suddenly sprayed out from the area of space before him. Suddenly, a dagger appeared on his right, and it stabbed straight at his chest. Yang Ye paid no attention to the dagger. He just stabbed once more with his sword, and another strand of blood sprayed. Actually, it should be said that 2 strands of blood sprayed out because one more came from Yang Ye’s chest!

Bang!

A moment later, a terrifying aura surged out from the area of space in front of Yang Ye, and a strand of sword intent surged out from Yang Ye as well. The sword intent and aura collided, and an explosion followed. Yang Ye was blasted 30m back while the space 30m ahead rippled violently.

Yang Ye paid no attention to the injuries on his chest and throat. He just took Heaven’s Gravestone in both hands and swiftly swung it forward.

His figure lunged over 60m forward, and the area of space behind him had been slashed open. However, Yang Ye frowned because that mysterious Voider had vanished again.

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings. He knew that Voider was definitely still here and watching him from somewhere. Unfortunately, he couldn’t sense that Voider’s aura at all!

Yang Ye swallowed a few violet crystals and said, “What? You don’t dare to fight me? Get out here!”

As soon as he finished speaking, his expression instantly changed because a translucent dagger had shot out from beneath his feet and shot towards his foot.

That Voider had actually been lying in front of him!

Yang Ye had quite an unsightly expression on his face. Because this technique of concealment was much greater than his own!

Yang Ye paid no attention to the dagger, and he just grabbed his sword with both hands and stabbed it down.

He was willing to exchange a foot for his enemy’s life!

Once he tried to defend himself, he would fall into a passive position, and he was determined to avoid falling into such a situation!

The best defense was offense!

Unfortunately, the enemy refused to make the exchange! The dagger immediately changed directions when the Voider noticed Yang Ye’s lack of any intent to defend himself, and it stabbed Yang Ye’s sword.

Bang!

A wave of energy swept out towards the surroundings. Yang Ye moved around 10m back, and the dagger had vanished.

Yang Ye didn’t try to find the hidden Voider anymore. His figure shot towards the distance instead.

Suddenly, that Voider appeared in front of him again, and a dagger swept towards him.

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly while he swung his sword forward. His sword slammed against the dagger, and the force of the collision pushed him around 10m back.

At this moment, he realized that the Voider’s goal was to keep him here!

Sure enough, that Voider didn’t attack if he remained still on the spot.

Yang Ye remained silent on the spot for a few breaths of time, and then he nodded, “Isn’t it just 3 Voiders? I won’t be leaving anymore.”

As soon as he finished speaking, the 2 old men’s figures appeared in the distance.
