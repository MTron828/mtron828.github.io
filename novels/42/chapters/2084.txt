Chapter 2085 – Elysium!

The old man glanced at Yang Ye, and then he flicked a spatial ring over.

Yang Ye was about to say something when the old man immediately took the young man with him and vanished.

Yang Ye glanced at the spatial ring, and then he was furious, “Playing tricks with me?!”

The spatial ring wasn’t empty, but there was only 350,000 in there!

It wasn’t a million at all!

…

High above in the clouds.

The young man stood respectfully behind the old man and didn’t dare speak a word.

The old man suddenly asked, “You’re really curious about his identity?”

The young man hesitated for a moment and said, “Grandfather, is he really so strong that even our Li Clan has to suffer such humiliation…”

The old man glanced at him, and the young man didn’t say more.

The old man stated, “I’m 90% confident in being able to kill him!”

The young man gazed at the old man, and the latter said, “But what about the aftermath? There are signs of both the Weapon Path and Dao Path on him! Even though I don’t know how important he is to them, I do know that an organization has placed a bounty on him and even sent at least three Sages after him. However, I don’t know where they are right now, but Yang Ye is still alive and well!”

The young man asked, “Both the Weapon Path and Dao Path support him?”

The old man shook his head, “I’m not certain. Both the Weapon Path and Dao Path aren’t helping him, but he’s not ordinary either. Moreover, it’s strange that the Sage Alliance acted against him. It’s a huge vortex, or I should say that Yang Ye is the vortex itself, and it’s very likely to be the vortex of the fight between Paths. It’s a vortex that our Li Clan can absolutely not get swept into. Otherwise, we’ll be obliterated!”

When he spoke up to this point, he gazed at the young man, “I can understand a young man’s desire to fight just because of displeasure because I’ve been young too. However, beware, never force yourself or your clan onto a path that leads to death just for that.”

The young man hurriedly said, “Grandfather, I understand. I won’t be impulsive anymore!”

The old man shook his head, “Everyone gets impulsive in their lives? Impulsiveness is always linked to a person’s drive, you can’t be impulsive, but you can’t lose your drive either. Anyway, just treat it as a lesson!”

The young man suddenly said, “Are we just going to let it go?”

The old man glanced at the place where Yang Ye had vanished from and said, “I think many people would like to know where he is!”

The old man waved his right hand and vanished with the young man.

…

Yang Ye didn’t leave Cosmic Star City, and he just found a hidden spot in the city instead.

In the Primordial Pagoda.

Yang Ye placed Blood Maiden within the Soulmend Casket. As soon as her soul entered it, crystal blue specks of light appeared around her soul, and they covered her entire soul.

It’s working! The negative emotions in Yang Ye’s heart were finally relieved completely. Blood Maiden hadn’t hesitated to detonate herself in order to save him, and it was something that he could never forget. Fortunately, he could make up for it.

Yang Ye left the Primordial Pagoda and left Cosmic Star City. Now that his presence had been exposed, he knew that it probably wouldn’t be long before someone came for him. So, if he didn’t leave now, he may not be able to leave at all.

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings, and he was just about to leave when he suddenly looked towards the right. He saw a middle aged man walking slowly in his direction. The middle aged man had a huge axe resting on his shoulder, and the axe was more than two times his size.

Yang Ye had met the middle aged man in the past!

The middle aged man suddenly stopped when he passed by Yang Ye, and then he glanced at Yang Ye before continuing forward.

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and soundlessly followed the middle aged man.

In the city.

Yang Ye followed the middle aged man to the Immortal Treasure Pavilion. At this moment, the auction was still going on. The middle aged man didn’t encounter any obstruction and succeeded at entering the auction house. However, he hadn’t gone in openly, and he’d snuck in instead.

No one noticed him.

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and snuck in as well. If it was before this, then he would definitely be incapable of avoiding detection from the Sages here, but he had the Bodhi Leaf, and when it was combined with the Sword Domain, he was able to avoid detection by even Sages.

The auction house was filled with clamorous noise, and the auction was still going on.

A charming and beautiful woman was standing on the round platform and introducing the treasures with a smile on her face.

Yang Ye glanced at the middle aged man who was hiding in the shadows, and the latter glanced at him too, but he’d only taken a short glance before withdrawing his gaze.

Time trickled by. Around 15 minutes later, the surroundings suddenly fell silent.

On the round platform, the woman suddenly glanced at the surroundings and smiled, ‘Everyone, the next item will be the final item for today’s auction. It can be said to be the best treasure we’ve auctioned in the last 30 years. It will absolutely not disappoint all of you. I’ll stop beating around the bush and show all of you what it is.”

As soon as she finished speaking, she patted her hands together, and an old man appeared on the round platform with a very long box in his hands.

The old man was actually a Sage!

Yang Ye recognized the old man, it was the same old man who’d confronted him earlier.

Yang Ye’s gaze fell on the box. What kind of treasure needs a Sage to escort it?

The woman bowed to the old man, “Thank you, Ancestor!”

The old man nodded, and then he moved to the side.

She waved her hand lightly, and the lid floated off the box to reveal a silver halberd.

A halberd!

The halberd was over a meter long, completely bright silver, and had a fist-sized pearl at its top. If one looked carefully, one would notice that the pearl was actually an eyeball. As for the lower end of the halberd, its hilt, there was a silver tail swaying about there. Additionally, besides the blade of the halberd itself, its entire body was covered in silver scales.

Besides that, there were red threads coiled around the halberd, and the box itself had a thin barrier of light around it. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Meanwhile, the woman suddenly smiled, “Everyone, this halberd is called Elysium, and it belongs to the number one war god of the god race!”

The god race!

The surroundings fell deathly silent.

Anyone with some strength knew what kind of race it was. It was the overlord of the large universe all those years ago, or it should be called the owner of the large universe. At that time, all races had to live while respecting the god race.

But many people here hadn’t heard of that race’s war god.

However, the old man’s eyelids twitched slightly when he heard that being mentioned.

Yang Ye shook his head. He finally understood why the middle aged man was here. He’d met the middle aged man in the past, and it was while he was at the town he met Tian Xiu in. The middle aged man had destroyed Emperor Xuanyuan’s tomb. Now, he was clearly here for that treasure of the god race.

Yang Ye glanced at the old man on the platform while a trace of pity appeared in his eyes.

The god race had emerged once more into the world, yet the Immortal Treasure Pavilion was actually openly auctioning off a treasure of the god race. Wasn’t that no different than courting death”

On the platform, the woman raised the box higher and said, “Everyone, while it’s at the Sage Rank, it isn’t an ordinary Sage Rank treasure. After all, it was made from a Sage Realm dragon. Moreover, many other treasures of the god race were used to forge it. Even a progenitor wasn’t able to destroy it with ease all those years ago.”

A smile curled up on her face at this point, “Possessing this treasure will give you the strength to kill enemies above your realm of cultivation. If you’re at the Major Zen Realm, you can even kill Sages with this! It’s no exaggeration. It’s even enhanced by many secret techniques of the god race, so it can penetrate all sorts of physical defenses and profound energy barriers. Moreover, a remnant of the dragon’s soul still resides within it. So, even if you encounter a formidable soul cultivator, that soul cultivator won’t be able to harm you while you’re protected by the dragon’s soul!”

Meanwhile, a voice resounded, “There should be two dragon eyes on the top of this halberd, so why is there only one?”

The woman glanced at one of the rooms and smiled, “It did have two dragon eyes, and it could see through all concealment. Of course, that’s a little exaggerated, but if there are only 10 types of concealment techniques in this world, then it can see through nine. Even if it has lost one of the eyes, seeing through six or seven isn’t a problem at all. As for why it’s gone, I have to mention the number one sword in this large universe at that time!”

The number one sword!

The woman smiled, “I’m sure all of you’ve heard of the number one sword in the large universe from all those years ago. Yes, the Sword Supreme, Emperor Xuanyuan’s sword. The other eye was lost in battle between the god race’s war god and Emperor Xuanyuan. It was the Sword Supreme that took it.”

She glanced at the surroundings and smiled, “Everyone, the Sword Supreme is with Yang Ye now. While its Sword Spirit hasn’t awakened, it will, one day. If you’re confident, you can go look for Yang Ye. Oh, allow me to give you a friendly reminder, Yang Ye is only at the Minor Zen Realm right now, and he showed himself in Cosmic Star City recently. So, perhaps he’s still around here!”

The woman smiled sweetly.

Yang Ye glanced at her and no one knew what he was thinking.

Meanwhile, the woman restrained her smile and said, “Everyone, this is a divine treasure, so it’s slightly expensive. The starting bid is five million, and the minimum increment is a million. I…”

Suddenly, her voice stopped.

Hiss!

An instant later, her body split into two, and her internal organs sprayed all over the ground!
