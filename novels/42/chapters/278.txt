Chapter 279 – The Little Fellow Is About To Awaken!

The members of the Heavenly Sword Sect were ready to die, so they didn’t hold back at all, and the profound energy within their bodies surged out like a torrent! With the profound energy within them surging madly into the vortex of sword qi, it revolved faster and faster while growing larger and larger. Moreover, the terrifying sword qi contained within it was extremely sharp to the point it was impossible to look directly at it!

Yang Ye had a slightly solemn expression as he gazed at the sword formation they’d formed. Even though he didn’t have a good impression of them, he had no choice but to admit that they were very strong! Especially the sword formation, the terrifying energy contained within it was something that even he really feared!

However, while they faced the dense horde of Darkbeasts within the Grand Myriad Mountains, it was useless no matter how formidable that vortex of sword qi was! Not to mention that the mysterious Luo Xue was present here as well! In other words, they were utterly unable to avoid death!

These disciples of the Heavenly Sword Sect seemed to be aware that they couldn’t avoid death, so they had resolute expressions. Of course, there was even more fear and sorrow on their faces!

Regardless of whether it was humans or Darkbeasts, would anyone not wish to live if it was possible?

Luo Xue grunted coldly as he gazed at the vortex shaped sword formation the members of the Heavenly Sword Sect had created. Right when he was about to give the order to attack, his gaze had suddenly glanced over inadvertently and noticed Yang Ye who was standing behind the members of the Heavenly Sword Sect. Luo Xue frowned when he saw Yang Ye, and then he said, “It’s you!”

The members of the Heavenly Sword Sect were stunned when they heard this, and then they gazed at Yang Ye with puzzled expressions in their eyes.

Yang Ye was first stunned when he heard Luo Xue speak to him, and then he laughed bitterly. The little fellow can’t show itself right now. So how would I flee if Luo Xue intends to make a move against me?

Yang Ye didn’t give it any further thought. He strode forward, gazed at Luo Xue, and then he said, “The last time we met, you led countless Darkbeasts to surround me, but I never imagined that our next meeting would be under similar circumstances. Could it be that we’re bound to rival each other?”

Luo Xue chuckled, and then he glanced at Yang Ye’s shoulder before he said, “Where is it?”

Yang Ye frowned when he heard this. He was naturally aware of who Luo Xue was speaking about. Could it be that the Darkbeast Empire still hasn’t stopped targeting the little fellow?

As if he knew what Yang Ye thought, Luo Xue continued. “I’m just asking about it, and I have no intention to make a move against it.” When he spoke up to here, Luo Xue hesitated for a moment before he said, “If it’s possible, then can you ask it to come out and meet me?”

Yang Ye heaved a sigh of relief when he heard Luo Xue. If Luo Xue really intended to target the little fellow, then he would be in danger. Because Yang Ye would definitely perish before this dense expanse of Darkbeasts if he didn’t possess the assistance of the little fellow’s bloodline pressure!

Yang Ye pondered deeply for a moment, and then he shook his head and said, “Not right now!”

Luo Xue didn’t get angry because of this. He merely nodded lightly before he glanced at the disciples of the Heavenly Sword Sect who stood by Yang Ye’s side. He said, “Are they your friends?”

When they heard Luo Xue, the hearts of those disciples of the Heavenly Sword Sect shook. Even an idiot would be able to discern that the relationship between Yang Ye and Luo Xue wasn’t ordinary! In other words, their fate was probably in Yang Ye’s hands! However, when they recalled the scene of them ridiculing and mocking Yang Ye just now, the bitterness of their faces grew even denser!

Yang Ye had discerned the meaning behind Luo Xue’s words as well. However, he understood that Luo Xue was absolutely not giving him face, and Luo Xue was giving the little fellow face instead! Otherwise, not to mention these disciples of the Heavenly Sword Sect, Luo Xue would probably annihilate him as well!

Yang Ye glanced at them before he said indifferently, “They aren’t!”

What a joke! Yang Ye wasn’t one that repaid enmity with kindness. He liked to repay evil with evil!

Their expressions instantly became unsightly when they heard Yang Ye.

Right at this moment, Yang Ye suddenly pointed at Liu Weiwei and Cai Yanyan, and then he said, “These two are!”

Luo Xue glanced at them, and then he glanced at Yang Ye before he said, “The three of you can leave!”

Yang Ye nodded. Right when he was about to leave, Liu Weiwei suddenly blocked his path and was about to say something. However, Yang Ye shook his head before she could speak and said, “Their fate has nothing to do with me!”

Save those idiots from the Heavenly Sword Sect? What a joke! Yang Ye wasn’t a kindhearted or magnanimous person, and if he wasn’t worried about those two assassins, then he would have summoned his army of Darkbeasts and annihilated these fellows!

Meanwhile, Cai Yanyan gazed at Yang Ye and said, “Hey, even though they’d gone a bit too far just now, their mistakes don’t warrant death! Moreover, didn’t my Darling apologize on their behalf? As a man, you can’t be so petty, otherwise, I would really look down upon you!”

It’s my mistake? Yang Ye felt extreme disdain towards Cai Yanyan’s words. If it wasn’t out of consideration for the fact that she’d spoken on his behalf earlier, he really wanted to just leave!

“Friend!” Meanwhile, Lieu Weiwei said, “The actions and words of these fellow disciples of mine were wrong, but just as Yanyan said, their mistakes don’t warrant death. All of us will definitely be eternally grateful if you lend us a hand!” As she spoke, she bowed to Yang Ye.

Yang Ye sighed. There was no relationship between this woman and him, yet she was still able to lend him a hand. Even though he didn’t need it at the time, he couldn’t deny that her actions had made him have a good impression of her. So, that was the reason why he was willing to save her! As for these disciples of the Heavenly Sword Sect.... Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Yang Ye raised his head to glance at the other disciples of the Heavenly Sword Sect, and then he suddenly said, “Do you think they will be grateful to me after I save them?”

Liu Weiwei was stunned, and then she looked at them. At this moment, even though they hadn’t revealed an embarrassing appearance, their countenances were still ghastly pale while the terror and horror in their eyes were not concealed at all. Of course, the most important aspect was the gazes they looked at Yang Ye with. Yes, their gazes towards Yang Ye didn’t carry even a shred of a guilty or pleading expression. Their eyes only had an icy cold expression within them, and there was even a little resentment amidst their cold expressions!

They were extraordinary geniuses of the northern territory, they were the youngest King Realm experts in the northern territory.... They enjoyed countless forms of glory, yet their fate was actually in the hands of a First Heaven Realm profounder. How could they accept this?

The thing geniuses lacked the least was pride. So, even if it was at a moment of life and death, they hadn’t spoken out to see assistance from Yang Ye!

Liu Weiwei sighed when she saw their expressions, and then she turned to look at Yang Ye before she said, “Don’t worry, I won’t allow them to repay kindness with enmity. Please!”

Yang Ye gazed at Liu Weiwei for a short while before he gazed at Luo Xue, and then Luo Xue immediately said indifferently, “You intend to protect all of them?”

Yang Ye shrugged and said, “It can’t be helped, I owe her a favor!”

“Being greedy isn’t good!” Luo Xue looked Yang Ye straight in the eye as he spoke.

“You ought to be clearly aware that you’re unable to stop me if I want to leave!” Yang Ye met Luo Xue’s gaze and spoke in an indifferent tone. These words were purely a bluff. If the little fellow had awakened, then Luo Xue would definitely be unable to stop him from leaving. But the problem was that the little fellow hadn’t awakened....

Luo Xue frowned. Even though he was extremely annoyed by Yang Ye’s words, he had to admit that he was really unable to stop Yang Ye while that mysterious little fellow was by Yang Ye’s side. It was even to the extent that if the mysterious little fellow joined forces with those disciples from the Heavenly Sword Sect, then it would definitely be an enormous calamity for the Darkbeasts in the surroundings!

When they saw Luo Xue fall silent, the hearts of disciples from the Heavenly Sword Sect had constricted. They didn’t want to die in the end. Of course, if it was possible to live, then would anyone be willing to die?

However, at this moment, they couldn’t avoid death just because they wanted to. Their fate was entire in Luo Xue’s hands. So, when they saw Luo Xue fall silent, they couldn’t help but become anxious!

As for why Luo Xue had fallen silent and hesitated, they’d unconsciously forgotten this key point!

Actually, Yang Ye was slightly nervous right now as well. If Luo Xue really made a move against them, then he could only turn around and flee. Because he couldn’t resist the dense horde of Darkbeasts without the little fellow by his side!

As for Liu Weiwei and Cai Yanyan, cold sweat had even seeped out from their hands. At this moment, they didn’t consider why Luo Xue was giving Yang Ye face, and it wasn’t just them, even the other disciples from the Heavenly Sword Sect hadn’t thought about this. At this moment, they were only thinking of a single thing, and it was about whether they could avoid death!

After a short while, Luo Xue looked at Yang Ye and said, “You’re heading to the Ancient Battlefield?”

Yang Ye was stunned. He didn’t know why Luo Xue had suddenly asked this question, but he didn’t conceal it and nodded before he said, “How could I not go and witness such a grand event?”

Luo Xue suddenly smiled when he heard this, and then he said, “Fine, I won’t take their lives for now. We’ll meet again at the Ancient Battlefield. I hope you’ll be able to give me an even more extraordinary surprise at that time!”

“You’re heading to the Ancient Battlefield as well?” Yang Ye frowned as he spoke.

“Of course!” Luo Xue said, “This is a grand event of the entire continent, so how could my Darkbeast Empire not attend?”

As soon as he finished speaking, Luo Xue glanced at the disciples from the Heavenly Sword Sect and said, “If you don’t leave the Grand Myriad Mountains in four hours of time, then don’t leave forever. Remember, the Grand Myriad Mountains doesn’t welcome people from the other territories!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he didn’t stay here any longer, and he led the countless Darkbeasts to withdraw like the tide.

The members of the Heavenly Sword Sect instantly heaved sighs of relief when they saw Luo Xue lead the Darkbeasts away. No matter what, they finally didn’t have to die at a place that was far away from home!

“Thank you!” Meanwhile, Liu Weiwei gazed at Yang Ye as she spoke.

Yang Ye shook his head, and then he gazed at the members of the other Heavenly Sword Sect and said, “There’s no need for that. You lent me a hand earlier, so I lent you a hand now. We can be considered to be even now! Right, just as you said, I hope....” When he spoke up to here, Yang Ye’s expression suddenly changed. After that, a wisp of wild joy surged into his eyes. Because right at that instant just now, he’d sensed that the violet barrier of light which covered the little fellow had suddenly started to tremble!

In other words, the little fellow was about to awaken!
