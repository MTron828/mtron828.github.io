Chapter 1857 – He’s Back!

Assassination!

Yang Ye was assassinating his targets now. He wasn’t confident in his ability to kill Quasi Enlightened Realm experts in direct combat, but he was very confident if he assassinated them.

It was easy to guard yourself against direct attacks, and it was the arrows in the dead of night that were difficult to avoid!

This time, Yang Ye’s target was another Quasi Enlightened Realm expert.

In a boundless mountain range. An ear piercing sword howl suddenly resounded in the quiet mountain range, but it only took an instant for the sword howl to vanish.

The mountain range became quiet once more!

At the bottom of a mountain, Yang Ye glanced at the corpse before him, and then he waved his right hand. The spatial ring on the corpse’s finger immediately flew into his grasp. He glanced at it and was delighted. Because there were over 100 low-grade violet crystals in it!

Even though he had Snowy and had no problem getting more violet crystals, Snowy wasn’t that diligent. Make them every day? Dream on!

Besides that, there were many other treasures, but they were of no use to him.

Yang Ye didn’t stay and vanished into the boundless mountain range.

It didn’t take long for Quasi Enlightened Realm experts to vanish in succession. Finally, some organizations started to notice it. So, they started to investigate. Thus, countless people throughout Heaven Pillar Mountain started to investigate who was slaughtering Quasi Enlightened Realm experts like this!

Meanwhile, the slaughter was still going on!

But it didn’t take long for Yang Ye to be forced to stop. Because Heaven’s Net stopped giving him information.

In the hall at the headquarters of Heaven’s Net.

Dark said, “You can’t continue killing them!”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Why?”

Dark replied, “You’re killed so many. Now, everyone thinks that it was my Heaven’s Net’s doing. If you continue killing, those Quasi Enlightened Realm experts will target my organization.”

Yang Ye asked, “Does your organization fear them?”

Dark shook his head, “You don’t know how complicated the situation in Heaven Pillar Mountain is. Presently, only some organizations are investigating Heaven’s Net. After all, so many Quasi Enlightened Realm experts have died, so they definitely aren’t able to sleep at ease! Moreover, I’m unable to tell them that it was you, Yang Ye, who killed them. Even if I said that you killed them, they will definitely refuse to believe me. So, stop for now!”

Yang Ye thought for a while and replied, “Alright. However, I need the location of members of the Night Assassins.”

Dark asked, “You plan to attack them?”

Yang Ye nodded.

Dark said, “You’re no match for the Night Emperor right now.”

Yang Ye replied, “I’m not going to openly attack them.”

Dark fell silent for a short while and said, “Fine, it’s your own business, so you make the decisions. However, I have to warn you that the Night Assassins aren’t ordinary. If you act against them, you may lose your life in the process!”

Yang Ye smiled, “Thank you for the warning!”

Dark didn’t say anything else when he noticed that Yang Ye had made up his mind. Dark just waved his right hand, and a scroll appeared before Yang Ye, “This is information on some of Night Assassins’ members. However, all of them are only publicly known members. There are many others like some old seniors of the Night Assassins. We aren’t able to obtain any information related to them.”

Yang Ye nodded, “Thank you!”

He vanished from the hall once he finished speaking.

Not long after Yang Ye left, a woman suddenly appeared here.

Dark bowed slightly, “My Lord.”

The woman nodded slightly and looked out of the hall. It was in the direction that Yang Ye had left towards.

Dark suddenly asked, “My Lord, why do you want me to help him?”

She glanced at him and said, “What are you trying to say?”

Dark hesitated for a moment and said, “Even though he’s an extraordinary genius, I think it’ll be very difficult for him to fully grow. Moreover, we’ve refused to provide his whereabouts to numerous powers, and it has made them extremely displeased. Especially the Night Assassins. It’s not worth it to offend so many for him!”

The woman glanced indifferently at him, “You don’t have to worry about that. Just do what I told you to do!”

“Yes!” Dark bowed again.

The woman withdrew her gaze and looked out of the hall. There were threads of emotion fluctuating in her eyes. She seemed to be recalling something.

…

After he left the headquarters of Heaven’s Net, Yang Ye went straight for Night Assassin City.

Night Assassin City was one of the four largest cities of Heaven Pillar Mountain, and it was a base of operation for the Night Assassins. However, unlike Divine Ruins City which allowed entrance to anyone who paid the entrance fee, Night Assassin City didn’t allow entrance to outsiders. Only the members of the Night Assassins were in the city.

At a corner outside the city gates, Yang Ye looked up at the city walls. There weren’t any people up there, nor was there anyone at the entrance to the city. However, Yang Ye was very well aware that there were experts guarding the city.

Yang Ye snuck into the city. After that, he glanced at the surroundings and vanished on the spot.

Night Assassin Hall.

There were a few dozen people in the hall, and a middle aged man was at the seat of the host. It wasn’t the Night Emperor; it was the number two figure in the Night Assassins, Ye Ji. He was the Night Emperor’s younger brother.

Ye Ji’s eyes were slightly shut, and the others below were silent. The hall seemed fairly quiet.

A short while passed before Ye Ji spoke abruptly, “What? Heaven’s Net still refuses to help us find Yang Ye?”

Meanwhile, an old man stepped forward, “Yes. Even if we’ve offered a very high amount of compensation, Heaven’s Net is still refusing, and they refuse to even give us a reason.” He hesitated for a moment at this point and continued, “I think there’s something strange about that!”

Ye Ji nodded slightly, “Of course. Actually, I’m really curious. Why is Heaven’s Net acting like this? It’s obviously impossible for them to be afraid of Yang Ye. Is it because Yang Ye gave them even more or even better compensation?”

The old man spoke solemnly, “I’ve investigated Yang Ye. He’s a vengeful person, and he’s extremely ruthless and decisive. Since enmity has formed between us, he’ll definitely fight us until the end. If we don’t eliminate him now, he’ll definitely become a venomous snake that waits to strike us from the shadows.”

Ye Ji grinned, “Don’t worry, we’ll find out his whereabouts very soon!”

The old man gazed at Ye Ji, and there was bewilderment in his eyes.

Ye Ji explained, “My older brother has gone to seek help from the Seer to locate Yang Ye!”

The Seer!

Everyone here was shocked upon hearing him. The Seer was one of the five Emperors. However, the Seer was the most mysterious amongst them and rarely made an appearance. Besides that, there was another rumor, and it was that the Seer had once fought one of the ancient cultivators. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Of course, it was just a rumor, and no one knew if it was true.

The old man asked, “Will the Seer agree to help?”

Ye Ji nodded slightly, “My brother just happens to have something the Seer needs. So, the Seer has agreed to help us once. Even though it’s just once, it’s enough.” He glanced out the hall and continued, “The Seer said we’ll receive the information around now. I presume it won’t take long!”

Suddenly, a scroll shot in from outside the hall.

Ye Ji waved his hand, and the scroll instantly flew into his grasp. A smile curled up on the corners of his lips as he gazed at it, “Speak of the devil. As expected of the Seer.”

He opened it while he spoke, and his expression changed drastically when he saw the words written on it, “Impossible!”

There were only three words on the scroll—Night Assassin City!

Suddenly, a speck of cold light flashed through the hall, and it caused the expressions of everyone here to change. They hadn’t expected that someone had actually snuck into Night Assassin Hall!

At the moment the cold light appeared, Ye Ji’s hairs stood on end, and then layer after layer of faint golden light appeared around him. At the same time, a wooden sword suddenly stabbed against the golden light above his forehead.

Bang!

The golden light shook violently and exploded apart, and then the wooden sword pierced through Ye Ji’s forehead.

Hiss!

A strand of blood instantly sprayed from Ye Ji’s forehead, but it only took a moment for another ray of light to suddenly erupt from within Ye Ji’s head. Ye Ji’s soul was instantly obliterated by the sword energy.

At the instant that Ye Ji’s soul was obliterated, the speck of cold light immediately retreated.

Meanwhile, someone in the hall shouted, “Stop him!”

As soon as the order was given, a few dozen auras swiftly enveloped down towards the cold light. However, as soon as they appeared, the cold light was already outside the hall, and then it only took an instant for the cold light to appear in the sky outside the city!

It came and went like the wind!

At this moment, everyone in Night Assassin City was stunned.

The Night Assassins had suffered a surprise attack!

Or to be more precise, someone had come to Night Assassin City and killed their second-in-command right before their eyes!

Everyone in the hall stared silently at Ye Ji’s headless corpse.

A short while passed before that old man who possessed a comparatively higher status stepped forward, and he said, “Immediately notify our Grand Leader!”

Meanwhile, one of them hesitated and said, “The Grand Leader said that unless we’ve found Yang Ye, we shouldn’t disturb him for anything else!”

The old man spoke angrily, “Have you not figured out what’s going on? That fellow from before used a sword! It was Yang Ye! Since Yang Ye was able to assassinate our Second Leader, it represents that he can assassinate any one of us. Immediately notify the Grand Leader and tell him that Yang Ye is here. He…”

The old man’s eyes opened wide at this point, “He’s back…”

He hadn’t even finished speaking when a speck of cold light suddenly appeared.
