Chapter 1978 – God Hall!

There were two violet gold words inscribed on the top of it—God Hall!

God Hall!

Yang Ye gazed at Zhi’er, “You’re from the god race!”

She grinned, “Big Brother, didn’t you know from the very beginning?” Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Yang Ye nodded, “I thought about it, but I didn’t give it much thought.”

She smiled, “Come, I’ll take you to meet some people!”

As soon as she finished speaking, she took Yang Ye’s arm and walked towards the palace. Suddenly, the Royal Crocodile opened its eyes.

Its eyes were blood red like two blood red holes, and it was extremely shocking!

Yang Ye stopped moving.

Pressure!

A wave of terrifying pressure!

At this moment, Yang Ye felt like his chest was about to explode, and it felt like dozens of mountains were on top of him!

He couldn’t breathe!

However, Zhi’er was completely fine!

Meanwhile, Zhi’er waved her right hand, and the pressure instantly vanished. The Royal Crocodile was stunned, and then excitement and joy appeared in its eyes.

The Royal Crocodile crawled slowly to Zhi’er. At this moment, its body had become the size of a human, and it laid there respectfully before her.

She glanced at it with a trace of complicated emotions in her eyes, and then she raised her right leg and tapped it lightly on the head, “Long time no see, big guy!”

The Royal Crocodile lowered its head further!

Yang Ye was extremely shocked by this scene. He didn’t know how strong the Royal Crocodile was, but it definitely surpassed the Dao Realm. However, such an expert was actually so respectful to her.

Who is she?

Meanwhile, she gazed at Yang Ye, “Big Brother, you’re amazing. After all, even a Dao Realm expert wouldn’t be able to remain completely unharmed after getting glanced at by this big guy.”

Yang Ye glanced at the Royal Crocodile and spoke in a low voice, “Zhi’er, since you’re regained your memories and found your people, I’ll be leaving!”

Yang Ye turned around and walked away.

Suddenly, Zhi’er appeared in front of him. She just appeared there out of thin air, and even Yang Ye hadn’t been able to sense how she got there.

She grinned, “Calm down. I want to show you some things. Moreover, I want to discuss some things with you too.”

As she spoke, she held Yang Ye’s arm and walked forward.

The Royal Crocodile followed behind them!

Just like that, Yang Ye was brought into the palace, and a white robed old man suddenly came to greet them.

The old man walked over to Zhi’er, and then he dropped to one knee, “Master, you’ve finally awakened!”

Zhi’er closed her eyes slowly, and a long time passed before she said, “Tell the others to get here within a month.”

“Understood!” The white robed old man stood up slowly and waved his right hand. In an instant, countless rays of white light flashed out from his palm, and then they entered the expanse of space before him.

Meanwhile, Zhi’er said, “What about those nine fellows?”

The white robed old man replied in a respectful manner, “The Nine Sages went into closed door cultivation and sealed themselves to conceal their auras. Do you want me to wake them up?”

Zhi’er shook her head slightly, “Not yet!”

The old man bowed respectfully, and then he moved to the side. However, he glanced at Yang Ye at this moment.

Yang Ye was looking at the old man too!

The old man felt unfathomable to him!

He knew that all of them were supreme experts!

“Come! Let’s head in!” Meanwhile, Zhi’er took Yang Ye’s arm and walked into the palace. It was extremely spacious.

The old man followed behind them.

Yang Ye asked, “What do you want?”

She grinned, “Big Brother, you should have heard of the god race, right?”

Yang Ye nodded.

She continued, “Then how much do you know about the god race?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “I only heard of it after arriving in the large universe. Why?”

Zhi’er smiled, “In the past, there was only one civilization in this universe, my god race. My god race was the ruler of this universe. However, the human race, demon race, devil race, and many others appeared later on.”

Yang Ye asked, “And then?”

Her smile gradually became cold, “When two civilizations appear in a single universe, war naturally occurs.”

Yang Ye asked, “And the god race lost?”

At this moment, it wasn’t just Zhi’er’s smile that was cold, even her gaze was cold.

She glanced at Yang Ye and said, “Even if all the races ganged up against my god race, what could they possibly do? The reason my god race lost was…”

She suddenly stopped at this point, and Yang Ye didn’t pursue an answer.

Meanwhile, Zhi’er became calm once more, “You came from the outside world. Not only were you hunted by the human race, even the other races hunted you. As for my god race, we want revenge. So, we can be said to have a common goal!”

Yang Ye asked, “What are you trying to say?”

Zhi’er smiled and gazed at the white robed old man by her side, “Bring the Armor of Worlds and the Pauldrons of War!”

The old man glanced at Yang Ye and left.

Yang Ye suddenly asked, “Are you the princess of the god race?”

“Princess?” She chuckled, “You’ll find out soon!”

Meanwhile, the white robed old man had returned, and he had an armor that flowed with golden light and a pair of pure gold pauldrons. They had all sorts of strange inscriptions on them.

“The Armor of Worlds and Pauldrons of War!” Zhi’er smiled, “They can be ranked in the top 6 of the treasures of my god race. Only the Divine General of Stellar War in my god race has the right to possess them. The last Divine General of Stellar War died in battle all those years ago. Now, they’re without an owner. They’re yours now!”

The white robed old man couldn’t help but glance at Yang Ye, but he didn’t say anything.

He was curious.

The old man was extremely curious.

The Divine General of Stellar War!

That represented an extremely high status in the god race. It could be said that someone with that title only obeyed the orders of the patriarch. Moreover, the Divine General of Stellar War possessed command over the god race’s Stellar War Army. The Stellar War Army was a force that made all the races tremble just from hearing its name!

The white robed old man was very curious about Yang Ye.

Because he knew that his master wasn’t a fool. Since his master thought highly of Yang Ye, there was definitely something extraordinary about the man before him!

Meanwhile, Zhi’er said, “These two treasures are merely inferior to that sword and treasure you have. If you wear them, no one below the Sage Realm will be a match for you!”

Yang Ye remained silent for a long time, and then he shook his head.

Refusal!

The bewilderment in the old man’s eyes grew at the sight of this.

She looked at Yang Ye in the eyes, “Why?”

Yang Ye pointed at his heart, “Freedom. My heart is free. When my heart is free, my sword is free. When it’s free, I can swing it as my heart desires. But if I agree to this, I’ll become your subordinate, and my sword will become your sword. I, Yang Ye, will never submit to anyone, and my sword will never do that too!”

The hall suddenly fell silent!

There was a trace of praise and surprise in the old man’s eyes as he gazed at Yang Ye.

Meanwhile, Zhi’er walked over to Yang Ye, “What if I insist?”

Yang Ye looked her in the eyes, “My sword would rather break than bend!”

Break!

Yang Ye was very well aware that if she wanted to act against him, then he wouldn’t be able to do anything about it. No matter if it was the Royal Crocodile out there or the white robed old man before him, their strengths far surpassed his own. But he refused to submit!

She gazed at Yang Ye for a long time before she said, “I know about all your secrets, and I know about that thing!”

A threat!

She was threatening him again!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly stretched out his hand and touched her cheek. The old man’s expression instantly became icy cold at the sight of this. However, because he received no orders from her, he didn’t do anything and just gazed coldly at Yang Ye.

Zhi’er gazed at Yang Ye as well and didn’t stop him.

Yang Ye moved his hand away and said, “If this is how the patriarch of the god race acts, then I’ll be very disappointed. I’ll be disappointed in you, and I’ll look down on the god race.”

Zhi’er didn’t say anything.

Yang Ye rubbed her head again and said, “No matter who you are, I once treated you as my younger sister. In the future… in the future, if you still call me big brother, then I’ll treat you as my younger sister again.”

Yang Ye turned around and walked away once he finished speaking.

The old man gazed at Zhi’er, but she did and said nothing.

It didn’t take long for Yang Ye to leave the hall, but the Royal Crocodile was in front of him.

The Royal Crocodile obstructed his path.

Yang Ye stopped and tightened his grip on his sword. Even though he knew that he wasn’t a match for the Royal Crocodile, he wouldn’t just wait for death to arrive.

The Royal Crocodile gazed at Yang Ye while undisguised ridicule could be seen in its eyes.

Suddenly, Zhi’er waved her right hand lightly. The Royal Crocodile glanced at Yang Ye and moved aside.

Yang Ye turned to look at Zhi’er, but she turned around and walked off deeper into the hall.

Yang Ye didn’t say anything and just vanished into the distance.

Meanwhile, the old man reminded, “Master, he knows about our whereabouts!”

She shook her head slightly, “He won’t expose us.”

The old man hesitated for a moment, and then he said, “Allow me to overstep a little, Master. He’s a human.”

She glanced at him and replied, “I know. But he’s very different from most humans.”

The white robed old man wanted to say more, but she shook her head, “There’s no need to say more. I’ve received news that the Strategist has awakened. Go contact her.”

The white robed old man was visibly delighted, and he left quickly.

Only Zhi’er remained in the hall.

A long time passed before she closed her eyes slowly, “Once all the races are annihilated, I’ll call you big brother again!”
