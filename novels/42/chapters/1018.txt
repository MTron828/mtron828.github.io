Chapter 1019 – Do You Know How Weak You Are?

If it was at any other time, Yang Ye wouldn’t have lost his senses even if the pain he suffered could be felt deep within his marrow. Because he had his sword intent to suppress it. However, he couldn’t utilize his profound energy right now, so his sword intent couldn’t be utilized as well. Thus, the sharp pain he felt could only be relieved by venting. Besides killing like a madman, there was only one other way to vent, and it was to vent through his lust. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Yang Ye’s instinct urged him to pounce decisively onto the woman.

The woman was wearing nothing beneath the robe, and her pure white figure was completely exposed within Yang Ye’s vision.

If it was at any other time, Yang Ye was able to stay true to his heart and keep his mind clear, so he could disregard her figure. But at this moment, the scene before him was undoubtedly capable of putting a spell on him!

Yang Ye instinctively pressed his lips against her lips, and his hands started to move up her figure.

She didn’t resist, and she just gazed at him with an extraordinarily calm expression on her face!

As he kissed her continuously and was about to go further, his eyes suddenly met her gaze, and as he gazed at her calm eyes, his figure stopped moving while the lust within his eyes reduced quite a bit.

They just gazed at each other for around 10 breaths of time, and then Yang Ye rolled off her body and waved his hands. Over a dozen pikes in the surroundings suddenly shot towards him and nailed him to the ground.

At this moment, the stellar energy within him had vanished, so the pikes had stabbed through his figure with ease.

However, the loss of stellar energy hadn’t reduced the pain he felt. Conversely, the sharp pain he experienced grew more and more severe once the stellar energy within him had vanished.

But at this moment, his mind was much clearer.

He didn’t pay any attention to the pain that swept through his body, and he just constantly recalled the woman’s eyes.

The tiny vortex had actually spun for a moment at the instant that their gazes had met!

It was a warning!

At that instant, Yang Ye’s hairs had stood on end. Because since the tiny vortex had been with him, it had given him warnings on less than 3 occasions.

Who exactly is she? However, it wasn’t long before Yang Ye stopped thinking about that. Because he’d almost fainted from the sharp and intense pain he suffered. This time, Yang Ye didn’t dare to let himself lose consciousness, and he forcefully persisted while ceaselessly recalling Su Qingshi, An Nanjing, Xiao Yuxi, and the others in his mind.

Time passed slowly, and Yang Ye finally felt his body feel slightly normal. So, he opened his eyes.

At this moment, the sky was dark, and it was covered in stars.

Yang Ye was just about to move when a wave of numbness came from his entire body, causing him to frown. He forcefully endured the discomfort he experienced and stood up, and then he walked over to the woman and sat in front of her.

She just gazed at him silently, just as she had before this. However, the gaze she shot at him gave him an indescribable feeling of horror.

Yang Ye said, “I had no intention to offend you!”

“But you did!” She spoke in a very calm voice, and she showed no signs of being angry.

“It was my mistake!” Yang Ye continued, “No matter what the reason was, it was my fault for doing such a thing!”

She said, “And then?”

Yang Ye fell silent for an instant before he said, “In any case, I won’t use my life to atone for my mistakes. Why don’t we just fight it out after we leave this place and recover our strengths? If I win, we’ll just let bygones be bygones; if I lose, you can do as you please to me. Alright?” He naturally had no intention to fight her. Because he’d decided to flee right away once he’d left this place.

She gazed at him for a short while and said, “Alright!”

Yang Ye heaved a sigh of relief in his heart because he would be fine for now. Even though the woman seemed like she didn’t possess even a shred of strength, could someone the tiny vortex warned him about be ordinary? Based on his inference, she’d definitely done something when he offended her earlier, and it made the tiny vortex sense danger and warn him.

In other words, she wasn’t completely without the ability to protect herself, she just didn’t want to. Based on Yang Ye’s speculation, the reason she didn’t want to utilize it was probably similar to why he didn’t want to utilize Heaven’s Gravestone. Because she would have to pay an unbearable price. Otherwise, she wouldn’t have only intended to utilize it when the situation had escalated to that level.

In short, she was dangerous!

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings, and a wisp of regret flashed through his eyes when he saw the corpses around him. If he could take those corpses with him and refine them into Sword Servants, then they would definitely be a huge help to him!

Unfortunately, he had no profound energy, and both his spatial ring and ancient sheath couldn’t be utilized. So, he wasn’t able to take these corpses with him!

Yang Ye shook his head, restrained his thought, and then gazed at the woman, “If I’m not wrong, then those savages should be the local inhabitants of this world. But I don’t understand why they were able to attain the Saint Realm when there’s no spirit energy or Quintessence Violet Energy here?”

She replied, “They definitely have a place which contains Quintessence Violet Energy!”

“Let’s go look for them!” Yang Ye spoke in a low voice, “We have to look for them if we want to recover, right?”

“We’ll be giving our lives away if we go now!” She glanced at him and said, “You’re too weak. You have to improve your strength first!”

Yang Ye asked, “My physical strength?”

She suddenly said, “Come over here!”

Yang Ye was slightly stunned, and he hesitated for a moment before he walked over to her.

She said, “Come closer!”

Yang Ye glanced at her and moved a little closer. At this moment, he was only a few centimeters away from her.

She gazed at him for a long time before she said, “Do you know how weak you are?”

Yang Ye didn’t know what to say.

She said, “Just the backlash from mere stellar energy caused you to lose consciousness. Tell me, are you weak or not?”

Yang Ye gazed at her for a long time, and he nodded in the end, “You’re right, I’m still very weak indeed.” Just as she’d said, being weak wasn’t anything shameful, and he really was very weak now.

She stared at him for a while, and then withdrew her gaze in the end, “Your foundation isn’t that bad, and it wasn’t pushed up with the use of treasures and external forces. However, if I’m not wrong, you definitely used less than 10 years to grow from the Mortal Realm to your current realm of cultivation. Right?”

“How did you know that!?” Yang Ye had a trace of shock in his eyes. Isn’t she a little too terrifying?“That isn’t something you should be worried about!” She continued, “Even though improving your strength to such a level in such a short period of time has allowed you to possess powerful strength, it has many disadvantages as well. Your mental state is too inferior in comparison, and it can’t catch up to the speed your strength is improving at. You haven’t comprehended the essence of every single realm of cultivation, and you’ve merely improved your cultivation to that realm. This has caused you to lose the strength that you should have possessed in that realm of cultivation. Besides that, there are numerous other problems.”

When she spoke up to this point, she gazed at him and said, “In the end, while your foundation from the Mortal Realm to the mid rank Half-Saint Realm seems to be very solid, that’s not actually the case. It’s just a false impression you get from looking at it on the surface alone. Once you truly encounter a problem, like the backlash from stellar energy, you would collapse in an instant. It’s like building a house. If the foundation isn’t solid, then perhaps the house would be able to resist some minor gales and storms, but it would instantly collapse before an earthquake!”

Yang Ye took a deep breath and said, “What should I do?” Actually, he’d been able to sense all of that, but it just wasn’t that clear for him. Or perhaps it could be said that he didn’t attach much importance to it. Now, when he heard the woman, he finally realized how serious it was!

She said, “Don’t attain the Saint Realm for 5 years!”

“For five years?” Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly, and quite some time passed before he said, “I need strength, powerful strength.”

She glanced indifferently at him and said, “Then do as you wish!”

Yang Ye laughed bitterly and said, “Alright, let’s put attaining the Saint Realm aside for now. Let’s talk about how I should become strong now. Otherwise, we might never be able to leave this place!”

“Control your strength!” She continued, “From now onwards, you’ll learn to control your strength and allow it to arrive at the brink of your body. If you can accomplish that, then the number of those savages would be nothing more than numbers to you!”

“The Brink Laws!” A wisp of excitement flashed through Yang Ye’s eyes, “You’re willing to teach me the Brink Laws!”

She glanced at him and said, “Let’s go somewhere else!”

Yang Ye nodded with excitement, and then he carried her up and vanished on the spot.

Not long after they left, a young man in luxurious robes and a group of savages appeared where Yang Ye and the woman were earlier.

The young man glanced at the surroundings, and then he looked up into the sky while a trace of happiness could be seen in his eyes, “I hope those fellows from the Radiant Dimension aren’t too weak....”

...

In the depths of a mountain range.

“The first thing you need to accomplish is to allow the heavy to be light. See that tree over there? From now onwards, I want you to practice blasting the bark of the tree into pieces. Remember, only the bark!”

Bang!

A fist smashed against the tree, and the entire tree was instantly blasted into bits. At the same time, a few dozen trees in the surroundings were blasted into bits as well.

“Again!”

Bang!

The tree transformed into powder!

“Again!”

Bang!

The tree transformed into powder again!

Just like that, Yang Ye punched trees incessantly every single day, and the tree in an area of around 10km in the surroundings had been blasted into powder in just a few days.

Of course, he’d obtained some gains as well. It was that he could concentrate his strength to the point it didn’t leak out. In other words, his strength was concentrated completely on the tree when he punched it, and it wouldn’t spread to the surroundings!

Before this, the same amount of strength had only been able to punch the tree into powder. Yet now, it could completely obliterate the entire tree!

Yang Ye was overjoyed from his gains. However, he still trained to accomplish what the woman wanted, to only blast the bark into pieces while the tree remained intact. So, he started training in an even more frenzied manner!

...

A month later.

Yang Ye walked over to an ancient tree, and he gazed silently at it for a moment before he smashed his fist forward!

Bang!

A soft explosion resounded, and then its bark was obliterated yet the tree beneath was completely intact.

A wisp of a smile curled up on the corners of Yang Ye’s mouth, and he turned around to look at the woman.

“You barely pass. Come, now try to allow the light to be heavy! Once you accomplish that, you can try to learn the Bring Laws!” said the woman.

Yang Ye asked in a low voice, “How strong is the Brink Law?”

She glanced at him and said, “Based on your current strength, your strength will instantly increase by at least 30 times if you’re able to master the Brink Laws!”

30 times! Yang Ye’s pupils constricted. His current strength wasn’t inferior to a Saint, so how terrifying would it be if it were to be increased by 30 times?
