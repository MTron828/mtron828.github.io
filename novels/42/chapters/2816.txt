Chapter 2817 – Get in My Way and Die!

High above in the clouds.

The woman in a plain dress opened her eyes slowly and looked up into the distant sky in silence.

The woman with the merged swords’ tears had already dried on her face, and only an icy cold expression remained on her face. She looked the woman in the eyes, “Are your current actions any different than the Heaven Dao of the past!”

The woman in a plain dress moved her gaze and shook her head while smiling, “Of course there’s a difference.”

The woman with the merged swords’ eyes narrowed slightly, and the desire to kill flickered within them.

The woman in a plain dress spoke softly, “Even though countless years have passed, I naturally haven’t forgotten what happened that day in those mountains.”

She gazed at the woman with the merged swords, “How many years have I been suppressing the Four Dimensional Universe? All because of what he said that day. I’ve lived for countless years just for him, and now, everything I’m doing is still… Forget it, it’s meaningless to tell you all of this. Just attack if you want!”

The woman with the merged swords looked at Destiny in the eyes, tightened her grip on her swords, and remained silent.

Because it was meaningless to say anything!

The woman in a plain dress tapped her foot down, and a ray of sword energy flashed forward!

The woman with the merged swords’ expression changed drastically, and then she stabbed her sword forward.

A ray of sword energy shot against the tip of her sword.

Bang!

Her sword shook violently and collapsed, and then a figure flashed by her!

Hiss!

Her eyes opened wide, and then she was blasted away.

While her figure shot backward, her figure shook and split into two people.

It was the woman in white and the woman in black!

Destiny didn’t attack again and just glanced at the woman in white and the woman in black, “Even if both of you merge into one, you’re still incomplete. You two don’t have the strength to stop me, so just leave and find your own paths!”

“Our own paths?” The woman in black wiped off the blood on the corner of her mouth, “Our brother’s dying wish is our future path!”

Destiny shook her head, “No one can stop me from annihilating the Dao! I’ll kill anyone who gets in my way!”

As soon as she finished speaking, a ray of sword energy appeared in her palm.

Suddenly, Yang Ye vanished on the spot.

Hiss!

The sound of something being torn apart resounded!

The woman looked to the side and waved her hand. A ray of sword energy that was thin as a needle forcibly pushed Yang Ye back.

Yang Ye was back where he’d been again, and the Sword Precursor was covered in cracks!

Meanwhile, the woman in white and the woman in black suddenly transformed into rays of black and white sword energy that charged at her.

Destiny’s gaze gradually turned icy cold. This time, the smile on her face had vanished.

Meanwhile, two swords appeared before her, and they stopped once more just around an inch from Destiny’s forehead. It was because two hands had clamped down on them!

One sword per hand!

It wasn’t just the swords that had been stopped, even the boundless sword intent and strength in them had been stopped!

Destiny gazed at them, “Both of you are too weak!”

The exerted force.

Bang! Bang!

The swords shattered, and both of them were blasted away!

Destiny took a step forward, and two rays of sword energy flashed beneath her feet.

Hiss! Hiss!

Suddenly, a footstep of sword energy appeared in the space between Destiny and the other two women!

It had been created by the step Destiny had taken!

The woman in white and the woman in black’s pupils constricted slightly. They were about to attack when two rays of sword energy arrived before their foreheads, and it pierced half an inch into their heads, causing blood to flow!

Suddenly, a wave of mysterious energy enveloped Destiny!

The Sword Domain!

The Fate Sword Domain!

At the instant the Sword Domain enveloped Destiny, a ray of sword intent soundlessly appeared behind her.

The woman in white and woman in black seized the opportunity to shoot backward, but just a moment later, they vanished on the spot.

Three rays of sword energy were like three bolts of lightning that crashed down upon Destiny within the Sword Domain!

All three of them had joined forces!

In the Sword Domain, Destiny grinned, “The Fate Sword Domain… Not bad. Unfortunately, it’s only a minor Dao! It’s nothing!”

She tapped her finger forward, and a ray of sword energy flashed from the tip of her finger.

Hiss!

In an instant, Yang Ye’s Sword Domain was forcibly slashed open. At this moment, Yang Ye’s features warped. After all, having his Sword Domain cut open was a huge blow to him!

At the instant the Sword Domain was slashed open, a ray of sword energy pierced through Yang Ye’s stomach.

Bang!

Yang Ye was blasted away!

Snowy, who was trapped by sword energy by the nearby Go board, witnessed this scene and started waving her paws madly. Strand after strand of spirit energy surged madly against the sword energy, but her spirit energy couldn’t even cause the sword energy to tremble!

She wanted to get out of there by force, but every time she came into contact with the sword energy, her figure would turn a little more ethereal!

Very few in the world could truly kill her, but this sword energy before her just happened to be capable of that!

In the sword energy, spirit energy was surging out incessantly from Snowy’s eyes. Every time she tried to escape, the sword energy would harm her and force her back. Her paws were already covered in injuries!

Meanwhile, after she heavily injured Yang Ye, Destiny turned around and waved her right hand, causing sword energy to surge like a waterfall.

Rumble!

The woman in white and the woman in black were blasted away!

Destiny ignored the two of them and gazed at Yang Ye. She walked slowly in his direction as she said, “Yang Ye, your order did surprise me quite a bit in the beginning. Unfortunately, you only focused on it and overlooked the most important point, human nature. Your order is a one-sided thing, and it is your own personal order. As far as I’m concerned, it’s something that can be destroyed with a snap of my fingers. Because it would be gone once you die.”

As soon as she finished speaking, she was in front of Yang Ye.

Destiny gazed at Yang Ye and grinned, “Of course, if you were given the time, you may have been able to perfect it. However, I don’t feel like waiting anymore. Regardless of whether it’s the Three Dimensional Universe or Four Dimensional Universe, they are too tiny.”

She gazed at the Three Dimensional Universe below, “Watch with me as this universe’s Dao is annihilated.”

She raised her hand slowly, and Justice shook violently above Eternal Border before gradually descending. As soon as it started descending, the entire Three Dimensional Universe started to turn ethereal.

Despair!

Countless felt despair as they watched the sword descend!

Suddenly, a pitch black hole in space appeared beneath Justice, and a vast universe was within it!

A moment of silence ensued before the black hole slammed itself at Justice!

Boom!

Justice shook violently and was forced to a stop!

A mysterious expert suddenly appeared in the air, and it was the same mysterious expert from the End World!

Destiny shook her head and smiled, “Heaven Dao, you’re finally unable to hold back any longer?”

Heaven Dao!

Yang Ye looked to the side when he heard her. While his eyes had been destroyed by her, his heart was not blind.

Yang Ye was quite surprised because he hadn’t expected that mysterious expert to actually be the Heaven Dao!

But wasn’t the Heaven Dao gone?

In the sky above the Eternal Border, the mysterious expert chuckled, “Destiny, let’s skip the unnecessary talk and put an end to the enmity from all those years ago.”

Destiny nodded, “Alright. I didn’t kill you all those years ago because you’re a part of this universe, and killing you would harm its foundation. Yet now, it is time for you to die.”

As soon as she finished speaking, she walked down from the clouds.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye slashed open the sword energy surrounding Snowy. The latter immediately pounced on him and kept rubbing her head against his chest.

Yang Ye rubbed Snowy’s head and cracked a smile, “G-Go inside for now, alright?”

Snowy nodded and obediently returned to the Primordial Pagoda.

Yang Ye gazed at his stomach. There were quite a few holes there, and they couldn’t be repaired. Primordial Violet Energy couldn’t repair the damage she caused at all, and his vitality was gradually fading!

Destiny ignored him and Snowy because his fate was sealed!

Yang Ye took a deep breath. A moment later, he gazed at the woman in white and the woman in black, “Leave. You’ve done enough for the Three Dimensional Universe. It’s pointless to meaninglessly sacrifice your lives like this.”

The woman in black shook her head, “We aren’t doing it for the Three Dimensional Universe alone.”

Yang Ye asked softly, “You’re doing it for that elder brother of yours?”

She nodded.

Yang Ye spoke softly, “You’ve done your best. Leave now. I really, really don’t want anyone else to die.”

He was very well aware that if they continued to fight Destiny, they would definitely die! They had no chance!

Destiny was so strong that she was practically invincible!

Good always triumphed?

No, this was no fairytale!

The woman in white and the woman in black glanced at Yang Ye. In the end, the woman in white walked over to Yang Ye and patted him on the shoulder, “No matter what happens in the end, we will do our best. This world can be destroyed at the hands of someone else, but it cannot be destroyed at “my” hands. Otherwise, the death of that young boy in the crevice wouldn’t have been worth it at all. Take care…”

As soon as she finished speaking, both of them suddenly turned around and chased after Destiny.Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“NO!” Yang Ye suddenly howled with rage. He ignored the injuries in his stomach and chased after them as well. However, he was too, too slow, and so he couldn’t catch up to them at all.

Destiny suddenly stopped beneath the clouds. Two rays of sword energy were approaching from behind her.

Both of their bodies and souls had started to burn up!

True ignition of the body and soul!

At this moment, their strengths surpassed their limits!

Indifference filled their eyes.

The people of the world were unaware that the strongest sword cultivator from all those years ago, Destiny, was merely the product of a promise to her elder brother…

Destiny pondered deeply for a moment, and then a sword suddenly appeared in her grasp.

Justice!

She turned around and vanished.

Two rays of sword energy flashed through the air.

The flames on the woman in white and the woman in black suddenly vanished, and then two gorgeous heads gradually fell to the ground.
