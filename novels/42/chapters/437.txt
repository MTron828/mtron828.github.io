Chapter 438 – Sword Soul!

In Clear Breeze Gorge that was at the back of the Sword Sect, the Unfettered One floated in midair, yet his lower half had vanished and only his upper body remained. Moreover, his upper body was growing more and more faint and translucent. It was like he was disperse at any time!

“I hope you can protect the Sword Sect on my behalf!” The Unfettered One was very frank and didn’t engage in any small talk.

Yang Ye was stunned, and then he shook his head decisively. “I’m only at the Spirit Realm, so what ability do I possess the protect the Sword Sect?”

Even though the Sword Sect had suffered heavy losses, a lean camel was still bigger than a horse. The Sword Sect still possessed numerous experts right now, and it even had a Monarch Realm expert. So, there was no need for him to protect the Sword Sect at all!

Moreover, even if he had the ability, why should he protect the Sword Sect? After all, if it wasn’t because of Su Qingshi, he would have even thought of helping Yuan Tian and the others annihilate the Sword Sect!

He had an utterly terribly impression of the six great powers!

The Unfettered One suddenly said, “Do you know what sort of sword technique I executed earlier while in the form of a soul?”

“What technique was it!?” Yang Ye’s eyelids twitched. He was very curious about that attack. Because that attack hadn’t utilized even a trace of profound energy, but a strand of sword qi had actually been utilized while under the circumstances of not utilizing profound energy. This made Yang Ye feel both shocked and puzzled at the same time.

The Unfettered One smiled and said, “It was a Soul Technique. To be precise, it was a Sword Soul Technique, a Sword Soul Technique formed from the essence, spirit, energy, Soul Energy, and Mental Energy. Moreover, it disregards the physical body. Unless the target of it possessed a Dark Treasure that specialized in defending against Soul Techniques, otherwise, that technique can even disregard the defenses of high-grade Heaven Rank Dark Treasures. Of course, the precondition is that your Sword Soul Technique is sufficiently formidable!”

A Sword Soul Technique!Isn’t this similar to An Nanjing’s Triad Mantra?

Yang Ye was tempted. Just the ability to disregard physical defenses and Dark Treasures were sufficient to tempt him. Just think about it, if he were to utilize that shocking sword within the tiny vortex that he’d obtained earlier and executed this Sword Soul Technique, then what would the effects be? If he was able to take his enemy by surprise, then he might even be able to instantly annihilate an Exalt Realm profounder!

Yang Ye took a light breath of air and said, “Senior, what are your conditions!?”

The smile on the Unfettered One’s face grew even brighter, and he said, “You’ve comprehended Sword Domain and the Enlightened Sword Heart, and you even possess Slaughter Sword Intent that’s the sharpest and fiercest amongst Sword Intents. Your natural talent really isn’t weaker to my own. Unfortunately, you haven’t been able to comprehend the Sword Soul. Of course, perhaps this is asking too much of you. After all, I only comprehended the Sword Soul when I was at the peak of the Exalt Realm!”

“The Sword Soul?” Yang Ye was puzzled. “What’s that?”

“Sword Intent is equivalent to the spirit, energy, and essence of a sword, and it’s capable of multiplying the strength of sword qi and sword techniques; the Sword Soul is equivalent to the soul of the sword, and it breathes life into the sword and sword techniques. Most importantly, once you’ve grasped the Sword Soul, you can utilize the spirit, energy, essence, and intent, Sword Intent, to make the four of them transform into a material state and form into another form of technique!” The Unfettered One spoke slowly.

Yang Ye laughed bitterly. So, there are actually so many different paths in the Sword Dao. Looks like I still have a very long way on the path of the Sword Dao!

The unfettered One suddenly said, “I can help you swiftly comprehend the Sword Soul!”

Yang Ye didn’t become delighted or excited. There was no free lunch in the world. Since the Unfettered One had spoken these words, then he definitely had some sort of conditions. Sure enough, he continued. “I only have a single condition. I hope that you can head to the extreme north of the central territory in the future. There’s an underground palace there, and there’s a person called Huan Bingyun within it. If she’s still alive, then pass my apology to her; if she’s dead, then just forget it....”

Yang Ye was slightly surprised. He’d thought that the Unfettered One would ask him to help the Sword Sect or ask him to join the Sword Sect, but he hadn’t expected that the condition would actually be to help the Unfettered One apologize.

Yang Ye pondered deeply for a moment before he said, “I agree!” He had no reason to refuse because it was just an apology, and it wasn’t difficult at all. Moreover, since that person, Huan Bingyun, knew the Sword Sect’s Founding Ancestor, then the chances of that person being alive was very tiny....

The Unfettered One nodded while his upper body had become practically translucent.

Yang Ye suddenly asked. “Senior, are you still alive?”

After the Unfettered One overcame the Heavenpath all those years ago, he’d vanished from the world, and his fate had always been a mystery.

The Unfettered One shook his head and said, “I don’t know. Don’t put on such a surprised expression. After all, I’m only a wisp of soul. There are very few memories kept within this wisp of soul, and it doesn’t have many memories of my main body.”

When he spoke up to here, the Unfettered One paused for a moment and said, “Don’t rashly try to overcome the Heavenpath. Even if you want to, you have to at least attain the fifth rank of the Monarch Realm, and you Sword Intent and Sword Domain have to be improved to a flawless state. Remember my words!”

Yang Ye wanted to ask him why but the Unfettered One had waved his hand and said, “I don’t have much time left. I’ll disperse the consciousness of this wisp of soul later, and then you must devour this wisp of my soul. This wisp of soul contains the method to comprehend the Sword Soul and some sword techniques I utilized all those years ago. Moreover, it contains some of my comprehensions and understandings of the Sword Dao. It should be useful to you.”

As soon as he finished speaking and before Yang Ye could even reply, the Unfettered One’s upper body suddenly shrunk and converged into a dot of light, and then it directly entered into the space between Yang Ye’s brows. Yang Ye’s face instantly warped because countless memories had surged into his mind, and the impact from it was extremely terrifying! Moreover, it struck directly at the mind!

A long time passed before Yang Ye’s expression returned to normal.

Besides numerous sword techniques of high rank and some comprehensions and experiences related to the Sword Dao, this wisp of the Unfettered One’s soul contained some memories related to Profounder Continent. For example, there were memories related to the Nether God’s Tomb in the Ninth Hell, Martial God Mountain, Sword Emperor Mountain, and various other places....

Of course, most importantly, it contained memories related to the Sword Soul! It turned out that the Sword Soul was just like Sword Intent. Both of them were in the form of intent, but the difference was that the Sword Soul was formed from the intent of the soul. To put it simply, one had to first grasp Sword Intent to grasp the Sword Soul because the cultivation of the soul required a soul cultivation technique and the assistance of Sword Intent.

The Soul Cultivation Technique was within the Unfettered One’s memories, and he possessed his own Sword Intent! So, all that remained was to find sufficient time to cultivate it!

Suddenly, Yang Ye turned around, and he noticed that Su Qingshi was standing not too far away!

Yang Ye walked over, and then he stretched out his hand and grabbed hers. The latter struggled a little, and then she just let him hold her hand when she noticed she wasn’t able to struggle free from his grasp.

As he gazed at the woman before him, Yang Ye sighed with slight emotion in his heart. In the past, he’d had countless thoughts about embracing her in his arms, and he could finally do it for realm now. Of course, there was some guilt in his heart towards her because he wasn’t able to belong only to her in the end.

Even though it was common for one to have a few wives on Profounder Continent, but would anyone be willing to share their Dao Companion with another? Moreover, she was even a woman who possessed an indisputable appearance and strength. However, all he could do was feel guilty right now because he was utterly unable to abandon Xiao Yuxi or Su Qingshi.

Yang Ye shook his head and discarded the distracting thoughts in his mind. Because it wasn’t the time to think about it now. He had many things to do now.

“How long have you been standing here?” asked Yang Ye.

Su Qingshi shook her head slightly and said, “Thank you!” nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Yang Ye knew why she was thanking him, and he immediately acted displeased and said, “Qingshi, is there any need for that between us?”

“I’m thanking you on the Sword Sect’s behalf!” said Su Qingshi.

Yang Ye grinned and said, “Then it’s even more unnecessary. The reason I stood forward to cooperate with the Unfettered One was because I didn’t want to see you in pain and sadness, and it wasn’t because of the Sword Sect. If it weren’t for you, it would be very likely that I would have even killed some disciples of the Sword Sect, in secret, to vent my anger. After all, you know how the Sword Sect treated me all those years ago....”

Su Qingshi flipped her hand to grab his hand instead, and then she gazed at him as she said in a light voice, “It won’t happen again. I’ll kill anyone in the Sword Sect who dares to think of harming you!” Even though her voice was light, it carried an unquestionable tone.

Yang Ye was slightly stunned, and then he joked. “What if it’s your father?”

“Then I’ll leave the Sword Sect with you!” Su Qingshi took the initiative to stretch our her hand and place them around Yang Ye’s waist, and then she buried her head in his chest as she said lightly, “At the moment you stood forward earlier, I knew that I’m very important in your heart. Because you were willing to change yourself and suffer for me. At that moment, I knew that I hadn’t misjudged you. From today onward, you and our child are always the first in my heart, and I don’t want to care about everything else anymore....”

Yang Ye was very moved. Suddenly, his eyes opened wide, and he pushed her away lightly and spoke with astonishment. “Child? Qingshi, child? What do you mean?”

Su Qingshi blushed a little before she pulled Yang Ye’s hand towards her and placed it on her stomach. Yang Ye was stunned on the spot when he touched it. Even if it was through her clothes, he was able to feel how smooth her stomach was. Of course, the most important part was that he felt that it had bulged up unusually!

What did Yang Ye feel at this moment? Happiness and excitement filled every cell in his entire body!

“HAHA!!!” Yang Ye lifted her off her feet, and then he leaped up and flew into the sky on his sword. At this moment, Yang Ye was happy like a child....

Su Qingshi revealed a rare smile on her face as well....

A short while later and after Yang Ye recovered from his excitement, he descended to the ground and held Su Qingshi’s waist as he spoke happily. “Qingshi, we actually conceived from just once. You’re really amazing. Wait, I’m really amazing as well....”

Su Qingshi blushed again, and then she pinched Yang Ye’s hands. She was quite unaccustomed to such jokes, but she wasn’t against it in her heart!

Yang Ye was about to say something. However, a wave of fluctuation arose in the space before him, and then a piece of information entered his mind.

It was a transmission talisman!

A short while later, the smile on Yang Ye’s face had gradually vanished, and it was replaced by a solemn expression.

“What happened?” asked Su Qingshi in a light voice.

“The Grand Qin Empire has made its move!” Yang Ye took a light breath of air. The opportunity he’d been waiting for had finally arrived!
