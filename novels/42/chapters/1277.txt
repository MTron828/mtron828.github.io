Chapter 1278 – Fight Him!

Yang Ye frowned when he heard Qian Lankong, and he felt puzzled. Suddenly, his expression changed. He didn’t hesitate to vanish on the spot, and she immediately vanished at the same time.

Less than a breath of time later, the space there rippled like the surface of an area. In the beginning, only the space in an area of 300m rippled, but it gradually spread out to cover an area of 30km. It seemed like a gale was blowing past an ocean.

“Yang Ye... Yang Ye!!” A voice suddenly resounded, and then it didn’t take long for the surroundings to return to calm.

Meanwhile, Senior Yuan and the others arrived here.

Senior Yuan spoke solemnly, “Feng Qiansha is dead.”

Ye Ming asked, “How do you know?”

Senior Yuan looked towards the distance, “If Feng Qiansha isn’t dead, then why would the master of Slayer Pavilion step forward himself?”

Ye Ming shook his head, “I never expected that the Slayer Pavilion which instilled fear in the hearts of everyone throughout the Veiled Region would have actually lost 2 Voiders in such a short period. Moreover, they were even lost to a Quasi Emperor. Haha! The Slayer Pavilion has truly suffered terrible losses this time.”

The Slayer Pavilion had just 3 Voiders. Now that Yang Ye had killed one and captured another. It meant that the Slayer Pavilion just had one Voider left.

It had truly suffered terrible losses!

Actually, at the same time that they felt shocked, there was a trace of happiness in their hearts when they heard Yang Ye had killed Feng Qiansha. It was none other than because they didn’t like the Slayer Pavilion. After all, it was an organization of assassins, and its members were mysterious. They were hidden in the shadows, and practically every other clan and sect had members of the Slayer Pavilion hiding within them.

So long as the Slayer Pavilion was given sufficient payment, those assassins would appear out of thin air by their sides and stab a blade in their throats.

An attack in the open is easy to dodge, but an arrow in the dark is difficult to evade. Even the Yuan Clan was extremely fearful of the Slayer Pavilion. So, now that the Slayer Pavilion had been weakened, it wasn’t a bad thing for them.

“Senior Yuan, what should we do now?” asked Ye Ming. It was the Yuan Clan who’d organized them to hunt and kill Yang Ye, and the Yuan Clan was the strongest clan amongst the powers in the Veiled Region. Moreover, Senior Yuan was the strongest amongst the Voiders here. So, all of them regarded Senior Yuan as their leader. At least he was their leader for now.

Senior Yuan gazed ahead for a long time before he said, “Wait!”

“Wait?” Ye Ming frowned. As far as he was concerned, they should go help. If they helped, then not to mention Yang Ye, even Jian Wuji at the Quasi Emperor Realm would have suffered death. But he hadn’t expected Senior Yuan to actually intend to continue waiting. In other words, Senior Yuan had no intention to attack. But it didn’t take long for him to come to an understanding.

Senior Yuan wanted Yang Ye and the Slayer Pavilion to crush each other!

If there was a power in the Veiled Region that could pose a threat to the Yuan Clan, then it was definitely the Slayer Pavilion. The Slayer Pavilion’s overall strength was inferior to the Yuan Clan, but the Slayer Pavilion wouldn’t fight the Yuan Clan openly. Their most terrifying ability was assassination. As it was said, an attack in the open is easy to dodge, but a dagger in the dark is difficult to evade. Even the Yuan Clan would probably live every day in anxiety if it was targeted by a group of extremely formidable assassins.

It was naturally for the best if the Slayer Pavilion’s master could kill Yang Ye, and their objective would be accomplished. But if Yang Ye killed the Slayer Pavilion’s master, it wouldn’t be a loss for them at all.

In short, regardless of who died in the battle, it wouldn’t be a bad outcome for them, and if both Yang Ye and the Slayer Pavilion’s master were injured in the battle, then it would be even better. Because they could take advantage of the situation and reap the rewards.

Ye Ming wasn’t the only one to figure out Senior Yuan’s intentions, the others did as well. After all, they’d lived for over 10,000 years, so they had at least that much intelligence. They supported Senior Yuan’s actions because they didn’t like the Slayer Pavilion as well!

Meanwhile, Senior Yuan said, “Don’t lend a hand. Just try your best to keep up with them.”

As soon as he finished speaking, all of them vanished on the spot.

...

Yang Ye and Qian Lankong were dashing swiftly. In just a few breaths of time, they were over 1 million kilometers away.

Yang Ye asked, “Is it the master of the Slayer Pavilion?”

Qian Lankong had a trace of seriousness in her eyes, “Yes!”

Yang Ye asked, “How strong is he?”

Qian Lankong replied, “Even our combined strength might not be a match for him!”

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly. Obviously, the master of the Slayer Pavilion was an existence at the Ten Thousand Legged Centipede’s level. Moreover, he might even be more terrifying. Because he was an assassin, an assassin that could appear out of nowhere. Fighting the Ten Thousand Legged Centipede was a head-on battle, but the master of Slayer Pavilion might strike from the shadows.

He’d acted like an assassin and killed from the shadows in the past, so he was very well aware of how terrifying assassins were. Not to mention that it was an assassin at the Voider Realm.

I can’t keep on fleeing, nor can I allow him to hide in the shadows!

Yang Ye remained silent for a while before he decided. Fleeing would just waste his profound energy. Once it was exhausted, he would be in an even worse situation. Moreover, if the master of Slayer Pavilion hid and refused to show himself, then Yang Ye would be practically helpless. Because Yang Ye would have to be on guard at all times and relaxing even in the slightest would definitely be met with a lethal strike from the Slayer Pavilion’s master.

Fight!

He could only fight!

He had to force the Slayer Pavilion’s master to fight him in a head-on battle!

After deciding, Yang Ye sent a voice transmission to Qian Lankong, “Hide yourself further away, and don’t attack for now. As for one you should attack, decide upon that yourself.”

He didn’t want her to join the battle so that the Slayer Pavilion’s master would fight him head-on, of course. If the Slayer Pavilion’s master knew that Qian Lankong was here, then he would definitely not fight Yang Ye head-on.

Qian Lankong asked, “What are you planning?!”

Yang Ye replied, “To Fight him!”

“You’ve gone mad!” Qian Lankong cried out involuntarily, “Yang Ye, you’re strong indeed, but you’re up against a Voider who has made a name for himself a long time ago. He isn’t comparable to those Voiders you killed earlier. Even Feng Qiansha whom you just killed can’t be compared to him.”

Strands of her soul were in Yang Ye’s possession, so she naturally didn’t want Yang Ye to fight this battle. It could be said that she might not be able to live if Yang Ye attacked. Even if she survived without those strands of her soul, she would definitely lose her mind. There was nothing in this world that could rebuild the soul. At the very least, she hadn’t heard of anything capable of that.

Yang Ye replied, “Then what do you think we should do?”

Qian Lankong was instantly rendered speechless. What should we do? Keep on fleeing? But flee until when? It was comparatively better for her, but Yang Ye’s profound energy would definitely not allow him to flee for long. How would he flee once his profound energy was exhausted? At that time, not to mention fleeing, even counterattacking would be impossible.

After a few moments of silence, Qian Lankong replied, “Do you really intend to fight him?”

Yang Ye answered, “I have no other choice.”

She asked, “Are you confident?”

“No!” replied Yang Ye. He really wasn’t. The master of the Slayer Pavilion was on the level of the Ten Thousand Legged Centipede. So, if he utilized the Sword God’s Seal to improve his sword intent to the Quasi Returnal Rank, then perhaps he might be able to kill his enemy. However, he absolutely didn’t dare to utilize it in the current situation he was in. Not to mention those fellows from the Veiled Region, he didn’t even trust Qian Lankong.

“Watch out for his space related techniques. His control of space is greater than mine, and he possesses the Laws of Wind as well.” Her figure vanished on the spot once she finished speaking.

Once she left, Yang Ye stopped, withdrew some violet crystals, swallowed them, and then closed his eyes.

A few breaths of time later, a blood red sword appeared in his grasp. Presently, his Rebirth Rank sword intent was superior to his slaughter intent, so utilizing Heaven’s Gravestone wouldn’t turn the surroundings blood red anymore. Because the baleful energy and slaughter intent were suppressed by his sword intent.

After that, he opened his eyes and said, “Since you’re here, then why don’t you show yourself?”

He received no reply.

Yang Ye chuckled, “You’re an well known extraordinary expert. Don’t tell me you have to use assassination techniques against a Quasi Emperor like me.”

“You’re no ordinary Quasi Emperor!” Meanwhile, a voice resounded, “I’m afraid that you’re probably the only Quasi Emperor on the continent who can kill Voiders right now. However, you’re right. I really don’t have to assassinate you.”

As soon as the voice finished resounding, a man in black robes and wearing a black mask appeared not too far away from Yang Ye.

Yang Ye’s heart shook when he saw the masked man. Even though the man wasn’t too far away from him, he couldn’t sense the masked man. It was like the man had fused into one with space, the air, the wind, and the entire world.

Extremely strong!

That was what Yang Ye felt about the man.

The masked man said, “Feng Qiansha is dead while Qian Lankong is still alive. If I’m not, she has probably surrendered to you. As for why Feng Qiansha was killed, I presume she contributed to it as well, right?”

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly. He hadn’t expected the mask man to actually guess all of that. Obviously, asking Qian Lankong to launch a surprise attack wouldn’t work.

Meanwhile, the masked man added, “It’s fine. She has been intending to betray me for a long time. So she can have her wish. Come, let me see exactly how strong a genius comparable to Jian Wuji is!”

Yang Ye would naturally not refuse. The ancient sheath appeared in his left grasp, and then his figure instantly appeared in front of the masked man. At this moment, a sword was sheathed in it, and then a ray of snow white light flashed. After that, a blood red sword appeared above the masked man. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

The masked man didn’t move at all and just allowed the blood red sword to descend. It pierced straight through the masked man’s body, but it caused Yang Ye’s expression to change instead. Because the masked man before him was just an afterimage.

Meanwhile, a dagger descended like a bolt of lightning towards Yang Ye’s nape.

Clang!

The dagger didn’t stab into his nape because the Phantom Shield was there to stop it, but the powerful force of the collision pushed Yang Ye over 100m away.

Yang Ye’s figure had just stopped when the space around him suddenly started to tremble, and then 2 daggers appeared around him. One was descending towards his nape while the other was sweeping at his throat.

Yang Ye’s expression didn’t change. The Phantom Shield moved to block the dagger behind him while he stabbed his sword at the dagger before him.

Clang! Clang!

Both daggers were stopped. However, Yang Ye’s pupils suddenly constricted. Because a dagger had suddenly appeared in front of him at the same time, and it stabbed into his stomach.

Hiss!

Blood immediately sprayed, and the dagger in his stomach shook slightly before slicing horizontally.

Hiss!
