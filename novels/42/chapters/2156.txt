Chapter 2157 – Continue!

The surroundings fell silent!

No one had expected Yang Ye to dare to attack first when facing so many Sages. Moreover, he’d instantly killed a Sage!

He’d killed a Sage in an instant!

By himself!

All the Sages here, including the Sovereign of Sky, had quite unsightly expressions on their faces.

This scene had surpassed their expectations.

At this moment, all the Sages had grouped up, and they were extremely vigilant. Yang Ye’s strength was more than just slightly stronger than it had been.

Suddenly, Yang Ye started walking in their direction, “I still haven’t gotten even with all of you for hunting me down. Now, you’re here again, so let’s get even then!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he stomped his right foot down and transformed into a ray of light that shot up into the air. Yang Ye grabbed his sword with both hands and swung it down at them.

A sword howl resounded, and then a ray of sword energy shot down like a meteor with the Sovereign of Sky’s group as its target.

They were naturally not afraid of Yang Ye’s attack. The Sovereign of Sky raised his right hand slightly before pushing it upward.

Bang!

A wave of powerful energy shot up into the air and slammed against Yang Ye’s sword energy.

Boom!

They exploded apart as soon as they came into contact, and a wave of energy erupted from the point of collision. However, it only took an instant for them to obliterate it.

At this moment, Yang Ye was still in the sky.

The Sovereign of Sky glanced at him and said, “I thought you would flee!”

“Flee?” Yang Ye spoke indifferently, “Why? Let’s put an end to all of this today.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye charged at the Sovereign of Sky. The latter’s eyes narrowed, and then a jade ruler appeared in his grasp!

The Sky Ruler!

A precious treasure of the sky race.

The Sovereign of Sky twisted his right foot against the ground. In an instant, he transformed into a ray of white light that shot up into the sky. Meanwhile, there were a few Sages by his side. All of them possessed extremely formidable auras, and they were the patriarchs of the various races.

There were ten more Sages who hadn’t joined the battle. It wasn’t that they didn’t want to, it was because a woman was standing before them.

It was An Nanjing!

An Nanjing held Elysium in her grasp as she gazed coldly at them in silence.

Meanwhile, they gazed at her with solemn expressions in their eyes!

They had naturally investigated An Nanjing, and they knew she was very likely to be the Martial God of the large universe!

The Martial God!

What did that represent? A Martial God had appeared in the large universe many years ago, and that Martial God was almost matchless. So, they naturally didn’t dare to act carelessly against her.

Suddenly, An Nanjing moved. She leaped forward and arrived before those Sages, and then she hurled Elysium at one of them.

That Sage’s eyes narrowed slightly. He took a step back and slowly raised his hands. In an instant, an ethereal shield appeared before him. At the same time, around ten pillars of light slammed against Elysium. However, they hadn’t been able to stop Elysium, and it arrived before the old man and stabbed against the ethereal shield!

Bang!

A loud explosion resounded, and the old man was instantly blasted 3km away.

An Nanjing wasn’t able to follow up with another attack because the other nine Sages had surrounded her!

One against ten!

Even though she was facing ten Sages, An Nanjing’s aura wasn’t inferior at all. As far as she was concerned, the more difficult the battle, the better!

Yang Ye was similarly facing around ten Sages too, and the Sovereign of Sky was among them.

The Sovereign of Sky gazed at Yang Ye, “Yang Ye, we can leave and guarantee to never look for trouble with you or the human race if you’re willing to hand over that Sprite Lord. Otherwise, both of you will die today!”

An old man by the Sovereign of Sky’s side said, “Yang Ye, we won’t harm the Sprite Lord, and we’ll even protect her well.”

A cold smile curled up on the corners of Yang Ye’s mouth, “Do you think I’m a child? Let’s just fight!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he transformed into a ray of light that shot at the Sovereign of Sky’s group.

While his cultivation wasn’t at the Sage Realm, his body was. Moreover, he had the Sky Dragon, so they couldn’t harm him at all in a short period of time.

Just like that, fierce battles erupted both above and below.

Explosions resounded throughout the starry sky.

.

Meanwhile, two old men were standing apart from each other high above in space.

One of them was the Dao Progenitor, and an old man emanating golden light stood before the Dao Progenitor. The old man was seated on a golden lotus. The golden lotus was crystalline, transparent, and gorgeous. The old man was the Buddhist Path’s ancestor.

The Dao Progenitor glanced at the Buddhist Progenitor and said, “Why don’t you just forget him?”

The Buddhist Progenitor grinned, “You’re mistaken, it’s the Sprite Lord that I cannot let go. As for Yang Ye, he refuses to come to his senses. The Sprite Lord was born from this world, so it shouldn’t be controlled by anyone, right?”

The Dao Progenitor nodded, “That does make sense. However, the Sprite Lord chose to stay with him. Since it’s the Sprite Lord’s own choice, we shouldn’t interfere.”

The Buddhist Progenitor shook his head, “It would be fine at any other time. But at this moment, you should understand what a Sprite Lord represents to us. While I do not fear the End Times, what about the followers of my Buddhist Path?”

He glanced at the battle below and continued, “My objective is very simple. I only want the Sprite Lord. So long as you can make him hand it over, then we’ll leave immediately and guarantee not to look for trouble with him again.”

The Dao Progenitor shook his head, “I’m afraid that I cannot!”

The Buddhist Progenitor nodded, “Then let’s watch a show together.”

The Dao Progenitor smiled, “We shall.”

Both of them gazed at the battlefield once more.

They naturally wouldn’t fight. Because if they did, this entire expanse of outer space would be obliterated. Not only that, even the large universe would be affected. Moreover, they were both Progenitor Realm experts, so it was impossible for them to kill each other. Unless they really fought with their lives on the line!”

…

Meanwhile, the battle was still going on.

At this moment, Yang Ye had been suppressed. The joint forces of the Sovereign of Sky’s group had completely suppressed him. Every single attack of his would be jointly stopped by them, and their joint forces made it impossible for Yang Ye’s sword energy to get close to them.

As for their joint attacks, they were extremely difficult for Yang Ye to resist.

There was a gap in both cultivation and numbers!

Yang Ye was clearly aware of this, so he was prepared!

Suddenly, the space here trembled, and then nine Sages appeared out of thin air. They were led by Lin Zhen!

All of them were the Sages of the human race!

Yang Ye wasn’t alone now. So, once he found out that the Sovereign of Sky had set up an ambush for him, Yang Ye had immediately contacted Lin Zhen and the others in the Human Dimension. They didn’t disappoint him and had rushed over immediately.

Once the Sages of the human race arrived, the battle here stopped. The Sovereign of Sky’s group moved 3km back and created distance between them and Yang Ye’s group.

Yang Ye walked over to An Nanjing. At this moment, her countenance was extremely pale, and there was a trace of blood on the corner of her mouth. Yang Ye wasn’t doing much better as well, his entire body was covered in injuries. While they were monstrous geniuses, they were facing over 20 Sages, and practically all these Sages had attained their realms of cultivation through their own effort. Yang Ye and An Nanjing didn’t possess the strength to fight ten experts like these on their own yet.

They were only barely able to resist such a force!

Yang Ye spoke softly, “Are you alright?”

She shook her head slightly, “I’m fine!”

She glanced at those ten Sages and continued, “I’m still very weak!”

The Sages before her instantly revealed extremely unsightly expressions when they heard this!

She is still very weak?

What the hell is that? If she’s weak, then what are we?

Yang Ye felt quite speechless as well. The things she said were really capable of angering people to death. If she was still weak, then no one in this world was strong. It could be said that besides progenitors, no Sage in this world could be confident of defeating her, including Yang Ye himself! But she actually called herself very weak!

Yang Ye shook his head and gazed at Lin Zhen’s group. Lin Zhen asked, “Are you alright?”

Yang Ye replied, “I’m fine.”

“Good!” Lin Zhen nodded, “What do we do now?”

What to do? Yang Ye gazed at the Sovereign of Sky. The latter glanced at Lin Zhen’s group, and the intent to retreat had arisen in his heart.

It wasn’t that he feared Yang Ye’s forces, it was because he wanted to kill Yang Ye and take the Sprite Lord while paying the smallest price possible. But if their groups fought, then even if his side won, it would be a pyrrhic victory.

So, once he thought up to this point, the Sovereign of Sky had made his decision. He glanced at Yang Ye and said, “Yang Ye, we are determined to obtain the Sprite Lord. If you refuse to hand it over, then the entire human race will be buried with you. So, give it some thought!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he turned around and led the others away.

However, Yang Ye suddenly said, “What? You’re leaving just like that?” Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

The Sovereign of Sky stopped and turned around to look at Yang Ye, “What?”

“What?” A cold smile curled up on the corners of Yang Ye’s mouth. He gazed at An Nanjing, and the latter spoke indifferently, “I can still fight!”

A smile curled up on Yang Ye’s face, and then he gazed at the Sovereign of Sky, “Then let’s fight!”

As soon as he finished speaking, a ray of light flashed forward.

At the same time, a sword howl tore open the space around him.
