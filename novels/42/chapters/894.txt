Chapter 895 – Apologize And I’ll Forget It Ever Happened!

Actually, Yang Ye was quite hesitant about whether he should allow himself to be dragged into this troublesome situation. After all, it was 2 extraordinary powers that were acting against the academy, and it wasn’t just Welkin Wolf Mountain Range. Yet now, he’d decided to head to the academy. Besides the promise the Dean had given him, there was another reason, and it was the Dean’s strength. It was a Saint who’d attacked him earlier, but it was obvious that Saint’s strength was inferior to the Dean!

So, he’d decided to make a gamble. While it was quite risky, attaining Void Rank sword intent was worth the gamble!

Yang Ye placed the Herculean Sword back within his spatial ring, and then he flashed off towards the distance.

It didn’t take long for Yang Ye to catch up to Leng Yuran and the others. However, he immediately frowned when he saw them.

At this moment, Leng Yuran’s group was in confrontation with those 4 fellows who were running for their lives just now. Moreover, Leng Yuran had a furious expression on his face while Hao Shuaibo and Hei Sha’s faces were gloomy, and their eyes were icy cold.

As for the other 4, they were sizing up Leng Yuran incessantly with teasing expressions on their faces.

The profound energy within both sides’ bodies were surging while their imposing auras collided incessantly. They were simply on the verge of battle!

Yang Ye spoke in a low voice, “What’s going on?”

Leng Yuran and the others’ expressions eased up slightly when they saw him. However, they hadn’t even had a chance to speak when the white robed man who led the group of 4 said, “You actually survived!”

All of their eyes had a trace of surprise in them.

Hao Shuaibo spoke in a low voice, “They teased Little Leng!”

“Teased?” The white robed man chuckled and said, “How could you call that teasing? Brother Leng is clearly a man. Since he is a man, then it shouldn’t be improper for me to ask for a hug, right?”

Yang Ye glanced at Leng Yuran, and he roughly understood what had happened. So long as one had a little bit of strength, it would be obvious that Leng Yuran was a woman dressed as a man, and that white robed man had probably realized that as well. So, he might have spoken in a slightly offensive or teasing manner, and that was what had offended Leng Yuran and the others!

When he thought up to this point, Yang Ye gazed at the white robed man’s group and said, “Apologize and I’ll forget it ever happened!”

“Apologize?” The white robed man was slightly stunned, and then he sized up Yang Ye and said, “Throughout my entire lifetime, I, Zhang Qingyun, have never apologized to anyone. Why don’t you teach me how?” Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Yang Ye raised his head to look at the white robed man, “Are you sure?”

Zhang Qingyun laughed coldly, “I’m very sure and certain!”

Slap!

A resounding slap resounded as soon as Zhang Qingyun finished speaking. Everyone watched as the right side of his face swelled up, but he wasn’t blasted flying because Yang Ye was standing in front of him and holding his collar.

“I’ll teach you right now!” As soon as Yang Ye finished speaking, he swung his palm repeatedly.

Slap! Slap! Slap!

Three breaths of time later, Zhang Qingyun’s entire face had swelled up like the head of a pig, and he was completely dazed.

It wasn’t just him, the others standing behind him were completely stunned as well!

As for Leng Yuran and the others, they were used to it.

Yang Ye tossed Zhang Qingyun over to Leng Yuran and said, “Now, do you know how to apologize? If you don’t, then I won’t mind teaching you again!”

Zhang Qingyun gazed resentfully at Yang Ye and said, “My... my... grand... grandfather... is... an... elder... in... the... outer... court.... You....”

Because Yang Ye had crushed his teeth and even slapped him to the point his mouth was crooked, Zhang Qingyun wasn’t able to speak smoothly right now.

Yang Ye gazed at Zhang Qingyun and said, “Are you trying to tell me that your grandfather is an elder of the outer court, and he will definitely come for me because I bashed you up?”

“Right....” Zhang Qingyun hadn’t even finished speaking when Yang Ye swung his palm against Zhang Qingyun’s face again. The powerful force in the swing caused Zhang Qingyun’s figure to be dragged against the ground as it flew off into the distance, and his figure tore open a trench that was over 300m long before it finally stopped.

He wasn’t dead because Yang Ye controlled his strength well!

Yang Ye walked towards Zhang Qingyun, but Leng Yuran suddenly grabbed his arm and said, “Forget it....” She was very angry in the beginning, but the anger in her heart had dissipated when she saw the miserable state Zhang Qingyun was in, and all she felt was pity now.

Yang Ye stated, “Men should respect women. It’s fine if he doesn’t, he can have a chance to change that. But I’m sure you’ve realized that he doesn’t intend to. So, I think that I should educate him. If he really refuses to listen, then I’ll have no choice but to end him. Otherwise, if he’s allowed to live, then he might rely on that grandfather of his to do even more excessive things!”

When he spoke up to this point, Yang Ye walked over to Zhang Qingyun, and he was just about to raise his hand when Zhang Qingyun spoke weakly, “I... I... I... I’ll apologize....”

“He asked for it!” Hei Sha spoke abruptly.

“He didn’t just ask for it, he even was a fool about it!” Hao Shuaibo added.

Leng Yuran shook her head and glanced at Yang Ye. There was a slightly complicated expression in her eyes because she felt that he was a little too violent.

Yang Ye picked Zhang Qingyun up from the ground and walked over to Leng Yuran while he pointed at the others from Zhang Qingyun’s group, “All of you have to apologize as well. I don’t have to teach you how, right?”

“No.... No....” All of them shook their heads. What a joke! Zhang Qingyun was a high rank Exalt Realm expert, but he hadn’t even been able to fight back against Yang Ye. They could

imagine how strong Yang Ye was, so how could they dare to go against his word?

After they apologized, Yang Ye casually tossed over a few extreme-grade energy stones and said, “I’ve taken a glance at the surroundings, and we should be safe for now. So, all of you recover first, and we’ll set out immediately once you’re all done.”

When he spoke up to this point, he glanced at Zhang Qingyun and the others, and he said, “If all of you want, you can come with us. However, you must obey my orders. You can leave right now if you refuse!”

One of the men said, “We... we’ll go with you!”

The others hurriedly nodded. After all, the mountain range was covered in demon beasts right now, and the slightest misfortune might cause them to encounter a powerful demon beast. That would definitely end in them dying a graveless death.

It was certainly much safer to follow an extraordinary expert.

Obviously, Yang Ye was an extraordinary expert in their eyes.

Yang Ye looked up into the sky. At this moment, it was clearly still daytime, but the sky was still pitch black. So, it was easy for him to imagine how terrifying the Welkin Wolf Demon King’s strength was!

Old man Dean, you better succeed. Don’t let me find out that you’re dead when I bring them back to the city. Then I would truly be fucked! Yang Ye withdrew his gaze, sat down cross-legged, and took out a few extreme-grade energy stones to recuperate.

Meanwhile, Leng Yuran suddenly walked over to him and said, “I think Pine Prefecture might be falling into chaos!”

Yang Ye asked, “Why?”

Leng Yuran spoke solemnly, “The academy has always maintained its neutrality and never participated in the battles between the various powers, including the demon race. But this time, Welkin Wolf Mountain Range has actually attacked, so there’s definitely something fishy going on.”

Yang Ye nodded. She wasn’t aware of it, but he knew that it wasn’t just Welkin Wolf Mountain Range, Sky Divine Hall was participating as well. Why has Sky Divine Hall acted against the academy? What’s their goal?

Yang Ye shook his head, restrained his thoughts, glanced once more at her, and then said, “What are you trying to say?”

Leng Yuran glanced at him and said, “You have a very good chance of escaping with the strength you possess. Or I should say that it wouldn’t be difficult at all. But why are you leading a group of burdens like us?”

Yang Ye said, “Are all of you considered as students of the academy right now?”

Leng Yuran glanced at him and said, “We’ve passed the 1st test. Strictly speaking, we’re considered students of the academy. Actually, this test wasn’t difficult to us at all, and the only reason we’re being tested is so that we can be separated into classes upon entering the academy.”

Yang Ye smiled, “That’s right. Since you’re all considered to be students of the academy’s outer court, then it’s definitely my business.” He would naturally not take responsibility for these students if he hadn’t accepted the letter of appointment from the Ocean of Clouds Academy. But the problem was that he had.

In other words, they could actually be considered to be his students!

Leng Yuran asked with a puzzled expression on her face, “Why?”

Bang!

Right at this moment, a huge explosion resounded from afar, and then countless explosions resounded incessantly.

Suddenly, 2 women dashed in panic from afar. Yang Ye was immediately stunned when he saw them because he knew both of them. They were Li Qingyi and Yu Wushuang!

“It’s you!”

“It’s you!”

Both of them simultaneously pointed at Yang Ye and spoke with astonishment.

Yang Ye nodded and said, “It’s me, Ye Yang!”

“Quickly save my Big Sister!”

“Quickly save my Big Brother!”

Both of them ran over to him, and then each of them grabbed one of his arms and started running back from where they came.

Leng Yuran and the others were stunned.

It didn’t take long for Yang Ye to see Li Maozhen and a woman who held a whip in her grasp. There was a robust man standing not too far away from them. Of course, the man wasn’t human because he emanated the thick aura of a wild beast!

Moreover, the man was a Half-Saint!

Li Maozhen roared furiously when he sensed that Li Qingyi had returned, “What are you doing back here!?”

“Wushuang! What’re you doing? Are you looking for a beating?” The woman with a whip glared angrily at Yu Wushuang.

“Big Brother, see who it is!” Li Qingyi pushed Yang Ye forward as she spoke.

Yang Ye was speechless.

Yu Wushuang spoke as well, “Big Sister! This fellow is very strong. You can rest now!”

Yang Ye was at a complete loss for words.
