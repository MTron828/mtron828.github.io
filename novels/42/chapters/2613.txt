Chapter 2614 – Yours is Mine!

Yang Ye and Blood Maiden were still waiting in the Void Space. They were waiting for Sky Maiden to regain consciousness!

As far as they were concerned, they had no other choice. Because they didn’t know which part of the Void Space was being devoured by Sky Maiden right now.

Instead of going off in search of her, it was better to wait here. After all, her body was here, so she would be back, sooner or later!

A long time passed. Energy was still surging incessantly from the surroundings, but Sky Maiden still wasn’t conscious!

Blood Maiden spoke softly, “You head back first. My presence here is enough.”

Yang Ye shook his head.

He was naturally unable to just rest at ease and leave Blood Maiden here at a time like this!

Blood Maiden wanted to say more, but the world around them suddenly shook. They hurriedly gazed at Sky Maiden. Meanwhile, the energy around Sky Maiden vanished!

It didn’t take long for her to open her eyes slowly!

Once she opened her eyes, she gazed at Yang Ye and Blood Maiden’s direction.

A moment later, she appeared out of thin air before them.

She sized up Yang Ye and gazed at Blood Maiden, “What are both of you doing here?”

Blood Maiden replied, “I lost contact with you, so we came to look for you!”

Sky Maiden pondered deeply for a moment and said, “It’s my mistake. I didn’t consider this. Both of you can go! I’m fine here!”

Blood Maiden was astounded, “You’re not coming with us?”

Sky Maiden glanced at the surroundings and grinned, “After I devour the entire Void Space!”

Blood Maiden was still puzzled, “Why?”

Sky Maiden explained, “I have an agreement with the Void Lord. He allowed me to enter the Void Space in return for devouring all the Void Planets in the Void Space.”

“Why?” It was Yang Ye who asked this question.

Sky Maiden glanced at Yang Ye and said, “The Void Space resides within the Void World, but the Void Space will grow larger and larger, and it will pose a threat to the entire Void World. If it is allowed to grow unchecked, the day will come when the Void World will be devoured by the Void Space. But the Void Lord cannot destroy the Void Planets here because if he does so by force, the energy created from their destruction would similarly pose a threat to the Void World. So, he exhausts a huge amount of manpower and resources from the various races here to suppress the Void Planets here from time to time!”

Yang Ye gained a slight understanding at this point!

Sky Maiden could devour the Void Planets without affecting the Void World, so it was a win-win for them!

Especially to Sky Maiden because devouring these Void Planets would make her boundlessly strong!

Sky Maiden asked, “Where are our sisters?”

Blood Maiden replied, “In Eternal Kingdom. All of them are safe. You have nothing to worry about.”

Sky Maiden nodded slightly. She seemed to have thought of something and gazed at Yang Ye, “They are with you?”

Yang Ye nodded.

She said, “Take good care of them.”

She turned around and vanished into the distance.

She left without the slightest hesitation!

Yang Ye laughed bitterly and gazed at Blood Maiden. The latter fell silent for a short while and said, “Since Eldest Sister is fine, let’s go too!”

Yang Ye nodded. He was about to leave with her, but she suddenly said, “You go first!”

Yang Ye nodded slightly, “I’ll be waiting for you outside!”

He left once he finished speaking.

Once Yang Ye left, Blood Maiden appeared before Sky Maiden.

Blood Maiden said, “Eldest Sister, he’s gone, so tell me the truth!”

Sky Maiden glanced at Blood Maiden and fell silent.

Blood Maiden spoke solemnly, “We’ve been sisters for so many years, so how could I not realize when you’re telling the truth and when you’re not? You’re definitely keeping something from me!”

Sky Maiden fell silent for a short while and said, “I’ve come into contact with some people and things. This world will grow increasingly bad, and the situation all of you are in will deteriorate as well.”

She gazed at Blood Maiden and continued, “We must grow even stronger, and I can grow even stronger by staying here.”

Blood Maiden spoke solemnly, “That’s it?”

Sky Maiden nodded, “Of course.”

Blood Maiden fell silent for a short while and said, “Take care, Eldest Sister.”

She turned around and vanished into the distance.

Sky Maiden closed her eyes slowly, and then a blood red character gradually appeared on her forehead—“诛”!

Sky Maiden gently rubbed the character which represented execute and remained silent.

Meanwhile, a mysterious figure appeared here.

Sky Maiden glanced coldly at the figure, “I don’t care whether you’re taking the desolate race or Eternal Kingdom’s side, but you’re not allowed to touch him and my sisters. Otherwise, I’ll devour the Void World next.”

The Void Lord asked solemnly, “Who is the existence who’s backing you?!”

A wisp of ridicule curled up on Sky Maiden’s mouth, “Why don’t you ask yourself?”

She turned around and left.

The Void Lord had an extremely unsightly expression on his face.

Sky Maiden had lied to Yang Ye and Blood Maiden just now. The reason she was here wasn’t as she’d said. The Void Lord would never allow an outside to devour these Void Planets, and the Void Space would never threaten the Void World either!

She was here because someone sent her here!

But the strength of that person was so overwhelming that the Void Lord didn’t dare to fight back!

...

Yang Ye and Blood Maiden left the Void World, and they immediately set off for Eternal Kingdom.

The Ancient Sword Sect.

Yang Ye returned to his own abode, or to be more precise, he returned to the Primordial Pagoda.

Training!

As far as he was concerned, he had to train right now. His strength could be stronger!

As for the Ancient Sword Sect, he had Sword Scroll, Elder Xue, and the others to manage the sect. So, he didn’t have to worry about the sect at all. Of course, he was paying attention to the Eternal Kingdom, the Soul Sect, and the other powers.

Or it should be said that all of these powers were watching him!

Presently, the entire Eternal Kingdom and especially the Soul Sect were absolutely worried about Yang Ye!

They were afraid that he would just go mad and start looking for trouble with them again!

Fortunately, Yang Ye didn’t leave the Ancient Sword Sect upon returning from the Void World, and this allowed all of those powers to heave sighs of relief!

Just like that, a few days passed before Sword Scroll suddenly appeared within the pagoda.

In the cultivation room, Yang Ye opened his eyes and gazed at her. Sword Scroll spoke solemnly, “They’re back!”

Yang Ye immediately stood up, and Sword Scroll continued, “But they may be in some trouble… Too, too many powers are targeting her!”

The her here was naturally Snowy!

The Sprite Progenitor!

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly, “I’ll go get them!”

Yang Ye vanished from within the pagoda.

A moment later, a sword howl shot up into the sky above the sect and vanished into the distant sky.

…

At the peak of a mountain, a young girl kicked a rock in front of her, “Big Sis An, what the heck is this place?!”

The tall woman in front of the young girl glanced at the surroundings and shook her head, “I don’t know!”

The young girl frowned slightly, “Big Sis Lianshuang is terrible! She didn’t teleport us to the wrong place, right?”

The woman shook her head, “It isn’t her fault. Someone damaged the teleportation formation and caused us to be unable to accurately enter Eternal Kingdom!”

It was intentional!

The young girl’s frown deepened. She seemed to have thought of something and gazed at the white little fellow on her shoulder, “Snowy, I bet a cotton candy that they are definitely here for you!”

For me?

Snowy blinked, and then she continued licking the cotton candy in her paws. She’d brought this over from Yang Lianshuang’s home, and it was soft, sweet, and absolutely delicious!

Something worth mentioning was that they’d brought many things with them!

It was a truly fun place!

Meanwhile, Erya seemed to have thought of something. She sighed and sat at the side.

An Nanjing glanced at Erya, “What is it?”

Erya seemed quite depressed, “That big guy that’s like a bird, that thing which could fly really high. What was it called again? Oh, it was a play something…”Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

An Nanjing corrected her, “Plane!”

Erya nodded, “Right, that thing. It was really fun, but it’s just too expensive. Even the money I borrowed from that place isn’t enough to buy one. What a pity! Otherwise, it would definitely be fun to have one here.”

An Nanjing glanced at Erya, “Why didn’t you just borrow one?”

Erya shook her head, “I’m a person with principles. If they refuse, how can I force them to lend one to me?”

An Nanjing stated, “You never thought like that when you borrowed money!”

Erya stood up, “That’s different!”

An Nanjing asked, “What’s different about it?”

Erya thought for a moment and replied, “That place had a lot of money. I did my research. They have the most money, it’s simply an unending supply.”

An Nanjing asked, “And?”

Erya blinked, “Since they have an unending supply of money, why can’t they lend me some?”

Snowy hurriedly nodded to display her agreement.

An Nanjing frowned slightly, “What kind of way of thinking is that? They don’t owe you anything!”

When she noticed that An Nanjing was slightly angry, Erya hurriedly withdrew something that looked like a piece of paper and showed it to An Nanjing, “Big Sis An, look! That place put this outside. They said to look for them when you’re in need, and they can give you a… Oh, a loan. I got a loan from them! They asked us to go to them when we’re in need! Moreover, we have to pay them interest on the loan, so it’s a really good deal for them!”

An Nanjing glanced at the paper, and what Erya mentioned really was on there!

A short while passed before An Nanjing gazed at Erya, “They only make money when you repay them, but how will they make any money if you don’t? Besides that you must return what you borrow. Understand?”

She felt that she should give these two little fellows a proper view on life! Because they were really too shameless right now!

Erya spoke guiltily, “I asked them at the time, and they said I don’t have to return any of it!”

An Nanjing laughed coldly, “You put such a huge blade to their throats, so how could they dare to make you return anything?”

Erya looked down, “Then… Big Sis An, w-when should we return it to them?”

An Nanjing thought for a moment. She was about to speak when Snowy suddenly appeared in front of her. Snowy waved her claws lightly. She was saying that Yang Ye had taken many crystals from her, and he’d never returned any of it!

An Nanjing was stunned speechless.

Snowy continued waving her claws.

She was saying that Yang Ye had told her that her possessions were his, and his possessions were still his. So, according to that logic, it should be the same for her and that bank. The bank’s money should belong to her, and her money should still belong to her.

Yours is mine, and mine is still mine.

That was how Snowy thought! Because that was what Yang Ye had taught her!

After she finished conveying it all, Snowy blinked and gazed at An Nanjing in silence. She was waiting for an answer.

An Nanjing was at a loss for words.
