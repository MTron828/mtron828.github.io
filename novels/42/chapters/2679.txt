Chapter 2680 – I’ll Give You a Chance!

Countless strands of unknown liquid were surging out from the statue’s nether regions!

At this moment, Yang Ye had been blasted over 10km away.

A long time later, he crawled up from the ground, and his chest was dyed red with blood!

However, he had a grin on his face.

A mad smile!

The smile on his face gradually widened until he started laughing madly, “HAHA!”

His laughter was like thunder that reverberated through the world.

The sword?

Yang Ye’s smile turned slightly bitter.

After training with the sword for so many years, he’d actually overlooked something.

Sword Insight! The ability to overcome all techniques with a single swing of the sword!

It was a very, very common technique that he’d learned a long, long time ago.

However, he’d forgotten it completely without even realizing. Because at most times, he didn’t need to look for any weak points, nor did he need any technique.

Learn a bit, forget a bit!

That was how he was!

His sword and Sword Heart were pure indeed, and they were stronger than before. So, when he fought, he’d practically just swung another time if the first couldn’t kill his opponent!

In short, his sword only contained brute force.

But that wasn’t the only thing a sword could do.

Just like this very moment. Now that he had lost his brute strength, he discovered a new direction, and a new door had been opened to him.

It was actually a door he’d opened in the past, but he’d forgotten about it. Now, he’d gained a deeper understanding of it and wouldn’t forget it again!

Sword Insight encompassed two methods of destroying an enemy’s techniques. The first was by force, overwhelming force. As for the second, it was by technique. It was by locating an enemy’s weak point and exploiting it.

Just like what he’d done a while ago. If he’d struck the statue’s hand or chest, it would have never been able to severely injure the statue.

The facts proved that where the sword struck was very important!

Yang Ye laid there and looked at the sky. It was night now, but there were no stars in the sky. All that he saw was an expanse of gray.

He recalled everything he’d experienced, and he realized that the things he’d forgotten in the past were actually so useful.

Yang Ye laughed bitterly. Others were constantly learning new things, but he was actually going to learn things from the past. Was it normal?

He didn’t know.

All he did know was that he wanted to give it a try!

Actually, Yang Ye didn’t know that this was the reason the woman in white had sent him here.

When a person went through great difficulty and climbed to the top of the mountain, that person would learn many things and have many thoughts. However, that person would similarly learn more new things and have more new thoughts while descending the mountain.

If Yang Ye thought carefully, he would notice that someone had reminded him of that in the past.

At this moment, Yang Ye had finally experienced how complicated the Sword Dao was.

The sword wasn’t that simple!

Two hours later, Yang Ye stood up and walked forward. The statue was gone when he arrived where it usually remained.

It was gone!

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings and walked toward the ruins.

Based on the size of it, it was the ruins of a city, and there were quite a few dilapidated buildings in it.

Yang Ye didn’t dare to be careless and walked forward vigilantly.

Meanwhile, in Eternal Kingdom.

The desolate race had sounded the horns of war.

It was back!

The desolate race’s army started to attack Eternal Kingdom. While they’d lost the Desolate Emperor, they still had their strength. Moreover, it was clearly not that weak.

Eternal River.

It became a battlefield again.

End World.

An old man and a middle aged man arrived there.

They were Huang Buer and the Eternal Lord.

Both of them wished to seek the End World’s help.

Because the side which obtained the End World’s help would definitely win. The desolate race may have had no need for the End World’s help in the past, but that was because it had the Desolate Emperor.

In short, if it wasn’t for the Destiny in a white dress, it was almost impossible for anyone in the Destiny Realm to kill the Desolate Emperor!

Now that the Desolate Emperor was dead, the desolate race had no choice but to show humility before the End World!

In the floating hall at the End World, Huang Buer and the Eternal Lord sat facing each other.

Both of them remained silent.

A long time passed before a voice resounded, “Please leave. The End World will not interfere!”

The Eternal Lord frowned slightly, “Why?”

The voice resounded again, “We have our own enemies, so we don’t want to interfere in these conflicts. Of course, you should keep in mind that Yang Ye is someone we are determined to kill. So, we don’t want any of you to have any ties to him. That’s all I’ll say. Please take your leave now!”

Huang Buer stood up and left.

The Eternal Lord looked toward the seat of the host and said, “The desolate race has some other trump card, right?”

Actually, the End World was more inclined to support Eternal Kingdom, but its attitude had changed now.

The only thing which could have done that was the desolate race possessing strength which even the End World didn’t want to deal with. It wasn’t worth the price they would have to pay!

The Eternal Lord received no reply, and so he left.

Once he left, a man appeared in the hall.

It was Mo Yu!

Mo Yu sat on one of the chairs with a calm expression on his face.

Meanwhile, an ethereal middle aged man appeared in the hall.

Mo Yu glanced at the middle aged man and said, “Heng Wangu, there should be no need to hide here with your strength. Moreover, you’ve even hidden your real body and dare not expose your full strength… Let me guess, Destiny probably has you in her sights. You’re unlike the others because Destiny will target you upon leaving this place, right?”

Heng Wangu nodded, “Indeed.”

Mo Yu smiled, “Anyone able to make Destiny target them is someone strong.”

Heng Wangu sat down and said, “Do you want to join the Defiance Alliance?”

Mo Yu shook his head, “No, but we have a common goal.”

Heng Wangu asked, “Yang Ye?”

Mo Yu nodded, “He must die.”

He gazed at Heng Wangu and continued, “Allow me to be honest, it’s best if you kill him soon. Otherwise, it won’t be long before all of you will probably be finished. Moreover, his strength may undergo a qualitative transformation.”

Heng Wangu fell silent for a long time and said, “He’s the person Destiny just chose, and you are the person Destiny once chose! However, you have probably been abandoned!”

Mo Yu’s face instantly turned icy cold, but it didn’t take long for it to return to normal.

Heng Wangu fell silent for a long time and stood up, “You kill him, alright?”

Mo Yu replied indifferently, “Of course, but…”

Heng Wangu nodded, “I understand. I’ll help you recover to your prime.”

Mo Yu smiled, “That’s for the best. However, I need some of his possessions once he’s dead!”

Heng Wangu replied, “You can take everything but the Sprite Progenitor!”

Mo Yu smiled, “Deal!”

Heng Wangu nodded slightly, “If it’s necessary, we can lend you a hand!”

Mo Yu shook his head, “No, it isn’t. I’ll kill him myself! So just locate him for me!”

Heng Wangu nodded, “It’s a deal!”

…

The World of Past Life.

Yang Ye was still walking forward slowly through the ruins. He hadn’t encountered any danger all along the way.

A long time passed before he suddenly stopped. There was a dry well up ahead.

There were strange sounds coming from the well!

Yang Ye shook his head and walked around it. While he was quite curious, he didn’t want to court death!

At most times, it was curiosity that brought death!

However, a voice suddenly came from the dry well, “K-Kill me…”

Yang Ye stopped and walked over to the well. He looked down, and he saw an expanse of pitch black. He couldn’t see anything!

Meanwhile, the voice resounded again, “C-Come down here!”

Yang Ye shook his head, “Dream on!”

Yang Ye turned around and walked away.

If he was in his prime, he would have nothing to fear. But it was best to act like this now!

Meanwhile, an insane voice resounded from the well, “Dammit! Damn human! Dammit! I’ll kill you…”

Yang Ye shot a cold glance at the well and continued onward.

He knew that the thing down there wasn’t anything good!

Two hours later, Yang Ye stopped. There was a dilapidated hall before him.

A hall!

There was only a single word “hall” on it. The words before it were missing.

Yang Ye walked in, and there were three wooden figures with swords in their hands.

Besides that, there was a statue before the wooden figures. However, it was a lifeless statue this time.

Of course, that wasn’t the main point. The main point was that Yang Ye recognized the statue.

It was the woman in white!

It was actually a statue of her!

Why was there a statue of her in here? What was her link to the Past Life Clan?

Moreover, if there was a link between her and the Past Life Clan, how could it have possibly vanished from the world?

Yang Ye fell silent for a short while, and then he walked over to the wooden figures. He scanned them, and then he suddenly noticed that there was a box behind them.

There were two words on it.

For you!

For me?Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Yang Ye was stunned. She left it for me?

Yang Ye didn’t think too much about it and just walked over. He was just about to pick it up when something unexpected occurred.

The wooden figures suddenly moved.

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!

Three rays of sword energy flashed.

They were absolutely fast!

Moreover, their angles were very tricky, causing Yang Ye’s expression to change drastically.

He raised his sword to defend himself. Meanwhile, one of the swords spun rapidly and struck the hilt of Past Life.

Bam!

Past Life shook violently and was blasted away!

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!

Meanwhile, two swords stabbed through Yang Ye’s chest. At the same time, one of Yang Ye’s arms flew into the air…

The three wooden figures lowered their swords and took a step back.

The leader of the wooden figures lowered its head slightly, “Master ordered us to give you a chance in the first round.”
