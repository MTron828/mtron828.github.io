Chapter 1984 – Fight Them!

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed on the spot. Looks like it’s not as simple as I imagined!

Yang Ye turned around, but there was no one there.

The voice spoke abruptly, “There’s no need to look. I’m not here.”

Yang Ye asked, “Who are you?”

The voice replied, “I would be very disappointed if you can’t guess that!”

Yang Ye smiled, “You should be the seal master that annihilated the Slaughter Line, right?”

The voice said, “The Weapon Path has six lines, Slaughter, Prediction, Merge, Technique, Breaker, and Guardian. I’m not from the Prediction Line!”

Yang Ye asked, “Then who are you?”

The voice answered, “You’ll find out in the future. Allow me to give you a piece of advice, don’t underestimate any line. It wasn’t that the Weapon Immortal didn’t predict that fellow’s fate, it’s just that he’d completely underestimated you.!”

Yang Ye asked, “What do you mean?”

The voice replied, “Take a look at his palm!”

Yang Ye turned around, and he saw a small ‘仙’ character that represented immortal in the young man’s palm.

“Words of Truth!” The voice continued, “The Words of Truth from the Weapon Immortal. If he didn’t underestimate you and used it immediately, then you would be a corpse now. Unfortunately, he underestimated you and acted carelessly upon noticing that you are at the 2nd stage of the Enlightened Realm. Of course, no one would have expected you to instantly annihilate a See Dao Realm expert while at the 2nd stage of the Enlightened Realm!”

Yang Ye chuckled. Actually, he hadn’t expected himself to be able to kill a See Dao Realm expert with a single attack.

During his battle with Dire Wolf, he’d merely heavily injured Dire Wolf and hadn’t been able to kill him. But this time, he’d been able to kill the young man in an instant. Of course, it was mainly because of Judgment!

Otherwise, his current strength was far from sufficient to accomplish that!

Meanwhile, the voice said, “We’ll meet again!”

Yang Ye asked, “Senior, are you not on good terms with the Prediction Line?”

“Hah!” The voice chuckled, “Kid, you really do have great potential. However, you’re still too weak. To be a little blunt, you’re not qualified to get involved in many things. Of course, I believe that it won’t take long for you to gain that qualification. I hope we meet again!”

Yang Ye didn’t say anything because that person was gone!

Yang Ye shook his head and left.

The Weapon Path was clearly not that united. However, it didn’t have much to do with him right now. He hadn’t even dealt with his current business, so he had no interest in interfering in the Weapon Path’s business.

The other races still hadn’t stopped pursuing him!

Yang Ye shook his head, restrained his thoughts, and vanished on the spot.

Back to Sky Residence City!

Yang Ye left the city and flew all the way on his sword. However, his expression changed, and he stopped while passing through the desert.

Yang Ye looked down, and he saw numerous red shadows emerging from the sand below before shooting swiftly in a single direction.

It was the direction of the area where Sky Residence City was!

What’s going on?

Yang Ye sped up. It didn’t take long for him to arrive at Hell Mountain Range. At this moment, powerful auras were frequently shooting up into the sky and flashing off towards the direction of Sky Residence City!

Yang Ye’s face became solemn, “We’re in trouble now!”

Yang Ye was about to speed up when he suddenly looked to the side. A group of people had arrived in the desert.

People? Yang Ye focused his gaze, and he saw a group traveling rapidly in this direction.

There were thousands of them!

What the hell? Yang Ye’s frown deepened.

A few breaths of time later, Yang Ye vanished on the spot.

He knew he had to rush back to Sky Residence City!

Yang Ye shot swiftly through the sky, and he naturally drew the attention of some formidable demon beasts. It didn’t take long for one to charge at Yang Ye.

It was a huge colossus. It was shaped like a lion, had an enormous head, a wide body, and claws that were actually over 3m long.

A cold glow flashed through Yang Ye’s eyes, and then he raised his sword and swung it.

Numerous afterimages of Yang Ye appeared in the air.

The sky suddenly fell silent, and then the afterimages vanished while Yang Ye was already long gone.

As for the demon beast, its figure stiffened on the spot. A few moments passed before it suddenly exploded into pieces.

Burial!

Yang Ye had used Burial to avoid wasting time!

…

“That was formidable!” A young man looked up at the sky and spoke softly.

There were thousands behind the young man.

“An outsider!” An old man by the young man’s side said, “None of the outsiders who dare to come alone to the Dead Dimension are ordinary. Chong’er, if you encounter them, you absolutely must not underestimate them. Understand?”

The young man nodded slightly, “Grandpa, has he really vanished?”

The old man looked into the distance, “Of course. Looks like someone has obtained the Weapon Path’s inheritance. But that’s good because it’s time for us to leave this place after being trapped here for so long!”

The young man asked, “Is the outside world really that good?”

The old man grinned, “It isn’t just good, it’s like a paradise. If you get to the outside world, then based on your natural talent, it’ll take you three years at most to get to the Zen Realm!”

The Zen Realm!

The young man intended to say more, but the old man shook his head, “Let’s go. If we’re too late, the others will take all the spirit energy in Southern Qilin Mountain!”

The old man waved his hand, and the others immediately continued their march forward!

…

Yang Ye didn’t go straight to Sky Residence City, and he went to the huge sword in Hell Mountain Range instead.

However, the huge sword was a pile of scrap now!

What happened? Yang Ye frowned. Didn’t he say that he could last for a month? But he’s gone already?

Yang Ye was about to leave when a figure floated out from the remains of the huge sword.

It was the middle aged man, but he was extremely translucent as if he would vanish at any moment!

Yang Ye asked, “What happened?”

The middle aged man laughed bitterly, “It’s all your fault! Why are you asking me?”

“Me?” Yang Ye was puzzled, “What do you mean?”

The middle aged man replied, “I kept myself alive just to wait for you. Kid, forget about the Weapon Path and Dao Path for now. That thing that’s following you, deal with it…”

Suddenly, a fine thread of red light flashed.

Hiss!

The middle aged man’s figure vanished.

Yang Ye’s pupils constricted slightly. He turned around, but there was nothing there!

That thing that’s following me?

Something’s following me? Yang Ye was bewildered!

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings, but there was nothing there. However, he was very well aware that something was there, because the middle aged man wouldn’t have vanished for no reason!

It didn’t take long for Yang Ye to think of something!

The evil weapon!

It was the evil weapon that Sage had been suppressing, and the former Sky Emperor had spoken about the evil weapon as well. Yang Ye hadn’t expected it to have followed him here!

It just refused to give up!

Yang Ye fell silent for a long time before he said, “You’ve been following me for so long, so how about you show yourself?”

He received no reply!

Yang Ye chuckled, “Will you really not show yourself?”

He still received no response.

Yang Ye shrugged, “Suit yourself!”

Yang Ye’s figure vanished into the sky. Yang Ye shot through the sky on his sword while he closed his eyes and immersed his consciousness into his body, “Judgment, are you able to detect what’s following me?”

Judgment fell silent for a long time before it replied, “A ball of red light!”

Yang Ye asked, “Do you know what it is?”

Judgment replied, “An evil artifact!”

Yang Ye asked, “Can you defeat it?”

Judgment fell silent for a moment and answered, “I can’t!”

Yang Ye’s face instantly became solemn. He didn’t know what level Judgment was at, but it was definitely extremely great. However, it actually admitted that it couldn’t defeat the evil artifact which was following Yang Ye!

Meanwhile, Judgment added, “It’s on the same level as the Sword Supreme. Even if the Sword Supreme’s sword spirit awakens, it probably won’t be able to suppress that thing. If I’m not wrong, it wants to acknowledge you as its master.

Acknowledge me as its master? Yang Ye was stunned, “Why does it feel like it wants to kill me?”

Judgment replied, “Evil artifacts are naturally called evil for a reason. However, it’s clearly afraid of that treasure within you, and that’s why it didn’t take you as its master by force. Otherwise, you would probably be dead by now!”

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly, “You know about the treasure within me?” He’d never told Judgment about it.

“I can sense it!” Judgment continued, “There’s something in you that makes me sense extreme danger, and it’s much more dangerous than that evil artifact!”

More danger than the evil artifact!

Meanwhile, Judgment added, “Why is it targeting you?”

Yang Ye spoke helplessly, “I want to know the answer to that too.” Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Judgment suddenly said, “It may be waiting for an opportunity. So, be careful!”

Yang Ye laughed bitterly. Of course he could only do that!

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings, and then vanished on the spot.

…

Sky Residence City.

At this moment, there was a huge barrier of light above the city. It covered the entire city. Besides that, A’Man and the others were on the city walls.

At this moment, all of them had solemn expressions in their eyes.

It was because the city was surrounded by a dense ocean of demon beasts.

Qin Chuan gulped and asked, “Big Sis, what should we do?”

A’Man glanced at the surroundings, “What else? Fight them!”
