Chapter 2239 – Master Yuan!

Slaughter intent!

Endless slaughter intent seeped out from within Yang Ye and filled the entire city in an instant.

Obviously, Yang Ye’s desire to kill was very strong right now.

Dugu Juetian’s eyes narrowed slightly while she slowly placed her hands on her short swords by her waist.

Suddenly, a voice resounded, “Stand down!”

Dugu Juetian was visibly shocked and moved away respectfully.

A middle aged man appeared not too far away from Dugu Juetian.

He wore a black robe, had his hands behind his back, and revealed a dignified aura.

He sized up Yang Ye and said, “Needless to say, I’m quite surprised the large universe has a genius like you.”

Yang Ye asked, “What’s your name?”

The middle aged man walked slowly in Yang Ye’s direction, “My undying race is led by our patriarch, and Lord Xiao Lou is beneath him. Beneath Lord Xiao Lou are the three wise men. They are in charge of training our army, and I’m one of them. They call me Master Yuan!”

Yang Ye nodded, “So you’re an instructor. Looks like you’re very strong.”

Master Yuan nodded slightly, “Sort of!”

“Please give me some guidance then!” Yang Ye transformed into a ray of light that vanished on the spot.

At the instant he vanished, Master Yuan raised his palm and pressed it down.

In an instant, the space before Master Yuan warped. At the same time, a wave of powerful energy rippled out from there. Coupled with the warped expanse of space, Yang Ye was instantly blasted away upon arriving in front of Master Yuan. Meanwhile, the space behind Yang Ye suddenly warped, and it forcefully sent Yang Ye to Master Yuan.

Master Yuan pressed his palm down once more.

Bang!

The space around Yang Ye exploded apart, but the energy within it didn’t vanish. A few dozen types of energy raged madly against Yang Ye who was in the chaotic expanse of space.

Meanwhile, Master Yuan frowned slightly.

Because Yang Ye hadn’t been obliterated like he’d expected. While Yang Ye was in the chaotic flow of space, Yang Ye didn’t seem to have suffered any damage.

Master Yuan gazed at Yang Ye, and there was a faint fiery red scale armor around Yang Ye!

The Primordial Armor!

The Primordial Armor which had been modified by the Samadhi Flame!

Master Yuan pondered deeply for a moment and slammed his fist forward!

Bang!

The space around Yang Ye shook violently, and then a wave of powerful force shot through space and slammed against Yang Ye’s head.

Yang Ye’s expression changed slightly. If the energy struck him, even the Primordial Armor wouldn’t be able to prevent him from at least suffering severe injuries or even death! Yang Ye had no time to think, he just grabbed his sword with both hands and swung it.

With his two intents enhancing it, its might was capable of obliterating a world. But Yang Ye’s expression changed again when he finished the swing!

Bang!

An explosion resounded, and he was blasted far away.

Yang Ye descended to the ground far away, and the ground beneath him collapsed in an instant. At the same time, he was still being pushed back. Yang Ye stabbed his sword into the ground, and just like that, he was pushed over 1km away more before he finally stopped himself.

“Your armor isn’t bad!” Master Yuan spoke abruptly, “Unfortunately, you’re a little weak.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he tapped a finger in Yang Ye’s direction.

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!

The space before Yang Ye cracked open in layers, and a wave of mysterious energy instantly arrived before Yang Ye with the intent to obliterate him!

Yang Ye looked up, took a step forward, and a mysterious wave of energy appeared here.

The Sword Domain!

Once the Sword Domain appeared, the energy instantly slowed down, and Yang Ye leaped forward and swung the Sword Supreme with both hands.

“Slash!” It was like his attack could slice the world into two.

Hiss!

With the Sword Domain’s support, it instantly obliterated the energy before Yang Ye. As soon as Yang Ye dropped to the ground, he tapped his right foot down lightly, and then he swung his sword at Master Yuan with both hands.

Master Yuan’s face remained indifferent as he took half a step back, and then he squatted down slightly before raising both his palms. A moment later, he pressed them back down.

A huge expanse of space before Master Yuan overlapped in layers, causing Yang Ye’s expression to change drastically when he arrived before Master Yuan. The overlapped space made him feel like a million mountains were pressing down upon him. At this moment, Yang Ye felt like he was about to explode, even with the Primordial Armor there to protect him!

“Go!” Meanwhile, master Yuan pushed his palms forward.

The expanse of space rippled forward.

Bang!

Yang Ye instantly felt like a sledgehammer had slammed against him, and then he was blasted away. Master Yuan immediately took a step forward and was about to follow up with another attack.

However, countless rays of blood red sword energy suddenly appeared in this expanse of space.

Master Yuan frowned slightly.

Meanwhile, the blood red sword energy suddenly started to flicker!

In an instant, the enveloped Master Yuan!

Suddenly, the blood red sword energy stopped as if everything had been frozen. An instant later, they gradually turned ethereal and vanished shortly after.

Yang Ye’s frown deepened.

Master Yuan was much stronger than he’d expected!

Master Yuan walked slowly in Yang Ye’s direction, “Needless to say, I’m really surprised you possess such strength at the Sage Realm. Unfortunately, your cultivation and accumulation are a little insufficient.” 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Master Yuan stretched his right hand forward and shook it lightly.

Bang!

A terrifying wave of energy suddenly rippled out of the space before Yang Ye, causing Yang Ye’s expression to change drastically. He didn’t try to defend himself. Conversely, he tapped his foot down, and then a sword soundlessly appeared behind Master Yuan just a moment later. After that, it stabbed at his back.

Backstab!

However, such a swift attack was stopped by a palm!

Yang Ye’s sword was pressed against Master Yuan’s palm, and there was a tiny ball of black energy at the center of Master Yuan’s palm. It was that ball of black energy which had stopped Yang Ye’s attack.

Master Yuan looked Yang Ye in the eyes, “Your sword isn’t bad.”

He shook his right hand once he finished speaking.

Bang!

Yang Ye was blasted away. At the same time, Master Yuan slapped his palm down.

Hiss!

A huge black palm suddenly emerged from the space above Yang Ye, and it slapped down at him.

If it struck, he would be obliterated!

Yang Ye forcefully stopped himself and looked up at it. At this moment, the palm was just around 10m away from him, and the powerful might it carried simply suffocated him.

A vicious glow flashed through Yang Ye’s eyes as he moved his left hand slightly, and the Sword Spirit appeared in his palm. An instant later, Yang Ye shot up into the air with two swords in his hands.

Hiss! Hiss!

One red and one bright ray of sword energy shot up into the air and tore open the sky!

The Sword Precursor could maximize his slaughter intent, and the Sword Supreme could maximize his sword intent. So, for the sake of fully releasing his strength, Yang Ye was using two swords!

Once he used two swords, both his slaughter intent and sword intent had risen to their limits.

Two rays of sword energy slammed against the palm.

Bang!

An deafening explosion resounded, and then the huge palm exploded open, causing the surrounding space to ripple like boiling water.

Master Yuan glanced at Yang Ye and spoke softly, “Slaughter intent, sword intent, and the Sword Domain. How rare, how rare indeed.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he tapped his right foot down and shot up into the air. Master Yuan stomped his foot down once more in midair, and then he shot at Yang Ye like a cannonball.

He was swift to the absolute limit!

Yang Ye couldn’t even see his movements clearly and could only defend himself instinctively!

Yang Ye swung his swords down.

Two swords at the same time!

Hiss! Hiss!

A huge hole was sliced open in the air, and then a figure was blasted away with two rays of sword energy.

It was Yang Ye’s figure!

Master Yuan glanced at his hands. There were two marks on the center of his palms. They were extremely deep and had almost pierced his palms. He fell silent for a moment before looking up at Yang Ye, “Interesting, interesting. A Sage actually injured me. Needless to say, you’re a monstrous genius!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he took a step forward, and a terrifying wave of pressure appeared here and overlapped upon itself before pressing down at Yang Ye.

Meanwhile, Dugu Juetian had moved away.

At this moment, she was extremely shocked. She knew how strong Master Yuan was, and ordinary progenitors would be no match for him. However, Yang Ye had been able to fight him for so long!

But Yang Ye was just a Sage!

Even Dugu Juetian was quite horrified by Yang Ye’s talent!

Meanwhile, the pressure slammed down upon Yang Ye, and Yang Ye suddenly swung the Sword Supreme at Master Yuan.

The latter shook his head slightly. While Yang Ye’s sword energy was powerful, it wasn’t enough against him.

However, Master Yuan’s pupils suddenly constricted.

Hiss!

The pressure Master Yuan emanated vanished without a trace, and a ray of sword energy arrived before him.

Hiss!

An arm suddenly flew up into the air while accompanied by a fountain of blood!

Master Yuan glanced at his left shoulder, and it was empty.

He fell silent for a moment, and then he looked up at Yang Ye. Or to be more precise, he looked at Yang Ye’s sword. At this moment, a faint layer of flames were covering Yang Ye’s sword!

The Samadhi Flame!
