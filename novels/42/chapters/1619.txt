Chapter 1620 - Are Zenith Realm Experts Very Strong?

Translator: InVader

Lu Lige blinked, and then he gazed at Yang Ye] There was undisguised admiration in his eyes.

What was it like to cry thief when you are the thief? What was it like to blame someone else?

This was it!

Suddenly, Yang Ye gazed at Lu Lige, and then he winked at him. Lu Lige immediately understood what he meant, and then he started to move backwards slowly with Yang Ye.

Meanwhile, Li Tianjiu was surrounded by the violet robed old man’s group.

Li Tianjiu paid no attention to Yang Ye and Lu Lige because he was surrounded by four Zenith Realm experts right now. Even though his strength wasn’t bad, it was impossible for him to fight four Zenith Realm experts on his own!

A moment of silence ensued, and then a wave of terrifying spear intent suddenly erupted from within Li Tianjiu. After that, he grabbed his spear with both hands and swung it forward. A brilliant ray of light flashed!

Bang!

The Zenith Realm expert in front of Li Tianjiu was blasted over 300m away. As for Li Tianjiu, his figure flashed and transformed into a ray of light that vanished towards the distance.

Li Tianjiu was no fool. How could he possibly fight four Zenith Realm experts on his own?

Fleeing was the best plan.

“You think you can flee?” The violet robed old man grunted coldly, and then he chased after Li Tianjiu. The other three Zenith Realm experts behind him hurriedly chased after Li Tianjiu as well.

Li Tianjiu was fleeing in Yang Ye and Lu Lige’s direction. Both Yang Ye and Lu Lige’s expressions became quite unsightly when they noticed this.

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment, and then he suddenly stopped and swung his fist forward.

Li Tianjiu was slightly stunned when he saw Yang Ye swing a punch at him, but his reaction was very swift. At the instant Yang Ye launched that punch at him, he immediately reacted and stabbed his spear forward.

Bang!

Yang Ye was blasted around 1km away again. However, Li Tianjiu had been forced to a stop as well.

Meanwhile, the four Zenith Realm experts had caught up.

Yang Ye said, “Seniors, I’m a subordinate of the Yang Clan’s Young Master Yang Yan. I’m willing to help you capture Li Tianjiu!”

“The Yang Clan’s Yang Yan?” The violet robed old man glanced at Yang Ye, “You’re from the Yang Clan?”

Yang Ye nodded, “Yes!”

The old man nodded slightly. He was about to speak when Li Tianjiu suddenly raised his palm and said, “I, Li Tianjiu, swear on my soul that the Earth Spirit isn’t in my possession. If I’m lying, I’m willing to be obliterated by the heavens!”

Yang Ye and Lu Lige’s faces stiffened when they heard this.

The violet robed old man and the others exchanged glances when they heard Li Tianjiu, and then they gazed at Yang Ye and Lu Lige.

At this moment, they believed Li Tianjiu. If the Earth Spirit was in Li Tianjiu’s hands, then Li Tianjiu would have definitely not dared to swear on his own soul. Not to mention Li Tianjiu, even they wouldn’t dare to rashly swear on their own souls.

After all, if they lied while swearing on their souls, it would cause them to develop inner demons!

As they say, one’s worst enemy is oneself. Cultivators like them really agreed with that. So, they would definitely not allow themselves to become their enemy.

Suddenly, Yang Ye raised his right hand too, “I swear on the soul of my Yang Clan’s Young Master Yang Yan that the Earth Spirit isn’t in my possession. If I lied, my young master’s soul will be obliterated by the heavens!”

Lu Lige’s mouth opened wide when he heard Yang Ye, and it was so wide one could stuff an egg in there, “What the heck! You can do that?”

“How shameless of you!” Suddenly, Li Tianjiu spoke angrily, “Why don’t you swear on your own soul? Why did you use your young master’s soul? Are you…”

“You’re the shameless one!” Yang Ye spoke angrily, “Do you realize that my life belongs to my young master, and I’ve sworn to only be loyal to him in this lifetime. If he wants me alive, then I’ll stay alive; if he wants me dead, then I’ll die. Do you know how much it hurts me to use him when I swear? I…”

“What the heck does this have to do with your young master?!” Li Tianjiu interrupted Yang Ye, “If you have a clear conscience, then swear on your own soul. If you use your own soul to make the oath, then I’ll believe that the Earth Spirit isn’t in your possession. Do you dare to do that?”

The violet robed old man and the others gazed at Yang Ye. Even they felt that Yang Ye’s oath wasn’t very reliable.

Actually, they would have attacked by now if they were facing anyone else. However, Yang Ye and the others weren’t ordinary experts. Their identity wasn’t ordinary, and they possessed the ability to surmount their realms of cultivation to do battle. So, the four of them didn’t want to shed all pretenses yet.

Yang Ye fell silent.

Meanwhile, Li Tianjiu suddenly ridiculed, “You don’t dare? Are you afraid?”

Suddenly, Yang Ye raised his right hand and said, “I swear on my soul that the Earth Spirit isn’t in my possession. I’m willing to be obliterated by the heavens if I lied!”

Actually, he wasn’t lying because it really wasn’t in his possession. It was in the Primordial Pagoda’s possession. So, he really did have a clear conscience!

As soon as they heard Yang Ye, both Li Tianjiu and Lu Lige were stunned.

They hadn’t expected Yang Ye to actually swear on his own soul. Because both of them were very well aware that Yang Ye had it. However, Yang Ye had dared to swear on his own soul. Needless to say, they were quite stunned.

Suddenly, the violet robed old man and the others gazed at Lu Lige. All four of them had quite hostile gazes, or it should be described as filled with hostility.

Lu Lige’s expression changed slightly, and he hurriedly raised his hands, “I… I swear on my soul as well. The Earth Spirit isn’t in my possession. If it is, I’ll definitely be completely obliterated in the future!”

The expressions of the four old men became gloomy when they heard Lu Lige. At this moment, they felt like they’d been played.

A moment of silence ensued, and then the violet robed old man spoke abruptly, “Why don’t we do this? Allow us to check your spatial rings and seas of consciousness, alright?”

Li Tianjiu and Lu Lige’s faces fell when they heard the violet robed old man. Searching their spatial rings wasn’t a big deal but asking to search their sea of consciousness was excessive. Or it should be said that it was extremely excessive. Because it represented that their secrets would be completely exposed.

Who would be willing to allow that?

In any case, Li Tianjiu and Lu Lige weren’t willing. As for Yang Ye, he didn’t mind because his treasures were in the Primordial Pagoda. Even though they were Zenith Realm experts, it was impossible for them to enter the Primordial Pagoda unless the Primordial Pagoda allowed it.

However, he still wouldn’t choose to let them search his spatial ring and sea of consciousness. Especially his sea of consciousness. If they were allowed to enter his sea of consciousness, then if they had even the slightest ill intent, he would be crippled even if he could avoid death!

Along with Yang Ye and the others falling silent, the atmosphere here gradually became tense.

Suddenly, the violet robed old man said, “If you’re unwilling, then I have another idea. Please come with us to our Wang Clan. So long as you’re willing to come with us, I guarantee that we won’t act against you.”

Go to the Wang Clan? Yang Ye laughed coldly in his heart. What a great plan. Once we go to the Wang Clan with him, we’ll be at the Wang Clan’s mercy.

The old man fell silent once he finished speaking, but his aura was still locked onto Yang Ye and the others. It could be said that he would immediately attack if they made the slightest movement.

Suddenly, Yang Ye glanced at Lu Lige. The latter nodded slightly. After that, Lu Lige drew his saber and swung it in front of himself. At the same moment, the Zenith Realm expert in front of Lu Lige had immediately slapped his palm forward.

Obviously, he’d expected the attack.

Bang!

Lu Lige was blasted over 1km away. Moreover, two Zenith Realm experts obstructed his path from both in front and behind him. As for Yang Ye, he’d appeared 30km away.

Li Tianjiu was over 50km away as well. However, there were two Zenith Realm experts behind him as well.

No one chased after Yang Ye. Obviously, they felt that the Earth Spirit was either in Li Tianjiu or Lu Lige’s possession. Actually, it was normal because Yang Ye was the weakest amongst them. Moreover, he was just a subordinate of the Yang Clan. So, the violet robed old man and the others had disregarded him. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

However, Yang Ye suddenly came back, and he went to Lu Lige’s side. Lu Lige was slightly stunned, and then he said, “What are you doing back here?”

Yang Ye felt speechless, “Are you serious? I asked you to flee, not fight.”

Lu Lige smiled with embarrassment, “I made a mistake. A mistake.”

Yang Ye shook his head, and then he turned to look at the two Zenith Realm experts, “Which one do you want?”

Lu Lige thought for a moment and said, “That one on the left!”

Yang Ye nodded and said, “You go first!”

Lu Lige glanced at him and said, “You won’t play any tricks, right?”

Yang Ye spoke angrily, “Am I someone like that?”

Lu Lige nodded in an extremely serious manner.

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

Suddenly, Lu Lige sent Yang Ye a voice transmission, “Even though you’re quite sly and shameless, you came back just now. So, I know that you’re still not a bad guy. You can’t fight Zenith Realm experts, so I’ll keep them busy while you retreat. Once you’re gone, I have my own ways to escape.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he stomped his right foot down, and he transformed into a ray of light that shot towards the Zenith Realm experts. In an instant, saber energy filled the surroundings and enveloped those two Zenith Realm experts.

Bang!

However, a loud explosion suddenly resounded from within the sea of saber energy, and then the saber energy rumbled and dispersed.

Bang!

A figure was blasted out from there, and it was Lu Lige. However, it didn’t take long for him to stop himself.

A cold glow flashed through Lu Lige’s eyes.

Suddenly, Yang Ye appeared in front of him and said, “Let me!”

Lu Lige was stunned and said, “One on two?”

Yang Ye nodded.

Lu Lige asked, “Are you sure?”

Yang Ye turned around and looked at him, “Are Zenith Realm experts very strong?”

Lu Lige was at a loss for words.
