Chapter 2083 – A Maleficent Existence!

Xiao Yue was stunned by this.

She hadn’t expected Yang Ye to suddenly attack. After all, it was the Immortal Treasure Pavilion, and it had been many, many years since someone had dared to cause trouble here.

The beautiful woman hadn’t expected it either, but it didn’t take long for quite an unsightly expression to appear on her face.

Since he dared to attack her here, she knew that he definitely had something to rely on. Moreover, once this incident escalated further, it would be absolutely disadvantageous for her. Because she’d frequently watched as others took the blame to resolve an issue, and she’d even done that to someone on many occasions.

So, as soon as she thought up to this point, the woman said, “Can we discuss this?”

“Discuss it?” Yang Ye raised her to face him and said, “Why didn’t you discuss it with me when you helped someone else act against me? Why didn’t you discuss it with me when you helped someone investigate me?”

The beautiful woman couldn’t help but glance at Xiao Yue, but the latter was looking down, and her hands were trembling.

Yang Ye suddenly said, “Stop looking at her. You won’t have the chance to look for trouble with her.”

It wasn’t that Yang Ye liked to cause trouble. He didn’t even know who wanted to look for trouble with him, but he knew that the auction house was helping that person.

The rules!

The auction house wanted them to follow its rules, and he’d done that. However, they were helping someone else break the rules and act against him. If it wasn’t for Xiao Yue, he may have been caught completely unaware.

Was it fair?

Obviously, it wasn’t. Since it wasn’t fair, he took action!

He was all alone right now. So, not to mention this auction house, he even dared to fight the Sage Alliance. Whether he could defeat them was an entirely different store, but in any case, he dared to meet them in battle!

Suddenly, an old man walked in.

A Sage!

Xiao Yue hurriedly bowed respectfully at the sight of him, “Elder Han!” Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

The old man nodded slightly, and then he gazed at Yang Ye and the beautiful woman. His gaze descended onto Yang Ye, “Didn’t you want to meet the person who’s really in charge here. I can be considered to be that person. So, can you let her go?”

Yang Ye released her, and she hurried to the old man’s side and bowed respectfully, “Ying Hong deserves death for disturbing you, Elder Han!”

The old man waved his hand, and the latter hurriedly moved aside.

The old man gazed at Yang Ye, “The Zen Realm. Since you dared to cause trouble here, I presume you have something to rely on. Come on, tell me what it is.”

The Immortal Treasure Pavilion’s forces weren’t weak, but someone like him who’d lived to his age was clearly aware that while there aren’t many organizations that are stronger than the Immortal Treasure Pavilion, there weren’t a few either. Some were existences that they couldn’t afford to offend, or at the very least, they couldn’t afford to offend it for something so minor. Otherwise, it may cause extremely troublesome conflict or even war between them.

Yang Ye chuckled.

Yang Ye sat at the side, “You immediately asked about my backing and not about what happened. So, this is how the Immortal Treasure Pavilion really acts. I wonder how everyone outside will think if they find out that your auction house joined forces with others to act against a guest.”

The old man’s eyes narrowed slightly, “You may not have the chance to leave!”

“You want to kill me to keep me quiet?” Yang Ye suddenly stood up and looked the old man in the eyes, “Why don’t you give it a try?”

He didn’t back down at all!

Ying Hong’s face grew even more unsightly. She knew that this incident had become even more difficult to deal with.

The old man suddenly appeared before Yang Ye, and then a wave of terrifying pressure slammed down at Yang Ye.

He was probing Yang Ye!

He was a Sage at any rate, so how could he be scared off by just a few words? However, he didn’t go too far and was just probing Yang Ye!

The aura of a Sage wasn’t something just anyone could resist.

However, as far as Yang Ye was concerned, defeating a Sage may be very difficult, but suppressing him with the aura of a Sage was only a dream. Yang Ye took a step forward, and a wave of dragon pressure swept out.

The dragon pressure had naturally come from the Sky Dragon. Of course, it wasn’t just the dragon pressure, there was his own aura too. Just the dragon presume was clearly insufficient to resist the pressure from a Sage.

The atmosphere in the room instantly became tense. The two girls watched as the auras converged together. A moment of silence ensued, and then they exploded apart and vanished without a trace.

The old man took a deep and long glance at Yang Ye, and he said, “It’s extraordinary that you possess such an aura and might in the Zen Realm. However, if that’s all you have, then you’ve made a huge mistake.”

Meanwhile, Yang Ye raised his palm, and a sword appeared in his grasp.

As soon as he saw the sword, the old man’s expression changed slightly, and he stared at Yang Ye, “It’s you!”

The sword in Yang Ye’s grasp was the Sword Supreme.

The old man naturally recognized it. After all, did anyone from his time not recognize it? Was anyone not aware that it was in Yang Ye’s possession right now? So, he’d recognized Yang Ye.

Yang Ye said, “I didn’t come here to cause trouble, and I only did this because I wanted to seek justice. Your people joined forces with others to act against me, so how will the Immortal Treasure Pavilion uphold justice for me? Of course, you can refuse, but that’s fine too. I can do it myself. To be honest, I have so many enemies that adding one more won’t make a difference.”

The old man’s expression was quite unsightly!

Yang Ye!

That maleficent existence!

He naturally knew a little about Yang Ye. The Sage Alliance was pursuing him and had even sent out more than one Sage. However, Yang Ye was still alive and well. So, he refused to believe that the Weapon Path or Dao Path hadn’t helped Yang Ye. While Yang Ye was a monstrous genius, he wasn’t that monstrous to be able to resist the entire Sage Alliance. At this moment, he had quite the headache.

How did we offend this maleficent existence!

As soon as he thought up to this point, he gazed at Ying Hong, and the latter turned pale. She knew that this person before her was someone that the Immortal Treasure Pavilion didn’t dare to rashly offend. So, she was going to suffer.

The old man said, “From now onward, you’re not a manager here. Return to the headquarters!”

Ying Hong laughed bitterly. It was the best outcome she could hope for. If she hadn’t made some contributions throughout these years, she would have probably lost her life. In the eyes of high and mighty Sages, the lives of nobodies were completely worthless. Not all Sages were kindhearted!

Ying Hong glanced at Yang Ye, and then she left.

Meanwhile, the old man asked, “Is that enough?”

“Compensation for emotional distress!” Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly said, “You joined forces with someone else to act against me, and it caused incurable emotional distress to me. It’s extremely disadvantageous to my future cultivation, so I think that you should compensate me somehow, right?”

The old man stared at Yang Ye, “Don’t go too far!”

“Go too far?” Yang Ye suddenly jumped up and said, “What? Am I wrong? You joined forces and even sold my information to that person…” He stopped and continued, “Fine, you don’t have to compensate me if you don’t want to.”

Yang Ye turned around and walked towards the door. He suddenly stopped when he arrived before it and said, “If others find out what the Immortal Treasure Pavilion did, I wonder if it’ll cause any adverse effect?”

Meanwhile, the old man appeared in front of Yang Ye, “What do you want?!”

Yang Ye stopped beating around the bush, “I came here for the Soulmend Casket, but it’s too expensive, and I only have 500,000 immortal crystals. I can’t afford it, I really can’t! I’m so poor!”

The old man gazed at Yang Ye for a long time and said, “That’s fine, we’re willing to sell it to you for 500,000. Let’s just consider it as us making friends with you, alright?”

“Really?” Yang Ye spoke with ‘excitement’, “Is that true? Oh my, I couldn’t accept that. But since you’re being so sincere, refusing would be too rude. Alright, I agree. Bring it over here now!”

Xiao Yue was stunned by this.

The old man glanced at Yang Ye. He didn’t hesitate and immediately got someone to bring the Soulmend Casket.

Yang Ye put it away, and then he passed 500,000 immortal crystals to the old man.

Yang Ye cupped his fist to the old man and smiled, “Thanks. Right, I have something else to do, so I’ll be bidding my farewells.” He was about to leave when he seemed to have thought of something, and he suddenly gazed at Xiao Yue, “I want to take her with me. It’s not a problem, right?”

The old man glanced at him and said, “No problem!”

Yang Ye nodded, and then he left with her.

Once they left, Ying Hong appeared in the room again.

Ying Hong suddenly asked, “Elder Han, who is he?”

The old man spoke indifferently, “A maleficent existence. We can’t afford to offend him or we’ll be dragged into some vortexes.”

Ying Hong spoke in a low voice, “Young Master Li from Room 3 plans to kill him. Should I warn him?”

Elder Han asked, “Who do you plan to warn?”

“That black robed man!” Ying Hong continued, “The Li Clan isn’t ordinary!”

The old man laughed with ridicule, “You should be warning that piece of trash from the Li Clan. I really don’t know what that old man from the Li Clan is thinking. He actually sent such a worthless idiot to embarrass him and even gave that idiot a violet Esteemed Guest Card. What an absolute idiot.”

Even he didn’t want to offend Yang Ye. It wasn’t that he was afraid of Yang Ye, he just didn’t want to offend Yang Ye. Because his troubles would be endless if he did.

Ying Hong was shocked, “Who is he? Even the Li Clan…”

Elder Han shook his head, “Ignore that, and don’t mention that useless idiot again. The Li Clan deserves to suffer. Moreover, they even caused us to suffer. Such idiots!”

He turned around and left.

Ying Hong was stunned on the spot.

The Li Clan.

It was the number one clan in the sky race!
