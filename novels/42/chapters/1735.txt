Chapter 1736 – Mysterious Woman!

Yang Ye had decisively chosen to enter the city when he found out those blood red figures could come down here.

What a joke!

If the blood red figures could descend the city walls, then he would definitely be unable to resist them!

Yang Ye took a few steps before turning to look at Ku Zhuyi, and then he gazed at the woman in a red dress, “Can I bring my friend along?”

She replied, “Yes!”

Yang Ye waved at Ku Zhuyi. The latter hesitated for a moment before flashing over to his side.

Meanwhile, Ying Mu suddenly said, “Miss, can we go in the city with you?”

The woman in a red dress stopped. She glanced at Ying Mu’s group and turned to look at Yang Ye, “Are they your friends?”

Yang Ye quickly shook his head.

The woman nodded. She didn’t say anything and just continued into the city.

Ying Mu’s expression became extremely gloomy. He remained silent for a moment and suddenly gazed at Yang Ye, “Brother, all of us came from the outside. It’s fate that allowed us to meet each other here, so why act like this?”

“Act like this?” Yang Ye laughed coldly and turned to look at Ying Mu, “Then why didn’t you deactivate the formation so that we could come in? Did you think about fate then?”

Ying Mu was about to say something when Yang Ye suddenly waved his hand, “Save it! Good luck! Bye!”

Yang Ye turned around and entered the city.

Repay enmity with kindness? Yang Ye would never do something like that. He liked to take an eye for an eye. He treated others in the same way that they treated him!

Ying Mu and the others’ faces were extremely unsightly.

Around 15 minutes later, the blood red figures on the city walls suddenly looked down at Ying Mu’s group, causing their expressions to change.

“Run!” Ying Mu didn’t hesitate to turn around and vanish on the spot. The others with him vanished on the spot as well.

Meanwhile, the blood red figures on the city walls transformed into ray so blood red light that leaped down the city walls. In an instant, rays of blood red light filled the silent night sky!

Monsters were flying through the sky!

…

After he entered the city with the woman in a red dress, Yang Ye noticed many blood red figures in the surroundings. Those blood red figures stared at him and Ku Zhuyi, but they didn’t approach them.

Even then, Yang Ye was still vigilant, and he was prepared to draw his sword if they attacked!

He wasn’t foolish enough to continue concealing his strength at a time like this!

Meanwhile, the woman who led their group said, “Don’t worry. They won’t attack you!”

Yang Ye glanced at her, “What are they?”

She sped up as she spoke, “You’ll find out in a moment!”

Yang Ye sped up as well.

It didn’t take long for her to lead them to a run down palace. Even though it looked very old on the outside, the inner area was very new and luxurious.

She walked to the seat of the host and sat there, and then she gazed at Yang Ye, “You possess Zenith Rank slaughter intent, right?”

Yang Ye nodded, “That’s why you asked me to come with you?”

She shook her head slightly, “I sensed the aura of a certain person on you. You should know him.”

Yang Ye asked, “Who?”

She fell silent for a long time before she replied, “An old man in Daoist’s robes who holds a horsetail whisk!”

The old man in Daoist’s robes! Yang Ye’s expression changed, “You know him?”

She glanced at Yang Ye, “You do know him.”

Yang Ye nodded, “I do. But how do you know him?”

She fell silent for a long time before she replied, “The seal on this city is something he casually placed here that day.”

Yang Ye asked, “Why did he come here?”

She shook her head slightly, “He was just passing by, and he only entered because there were evil cultivators here.”

“Evil cultivators?” Yang Ye asked, “There are evil cultivators here?”

She gazed at Yang Ye, “Those rotting corpses and those blood red figures are all evil cultivators. Or I should say that besides all of you who came in from the outside world, everything you see here is an evil cultivator. Including me!”

Yang Ye was stunned speechless.

Ku Zhuyi asked, “What are evil cultivators?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “I’ll explain later.”

He gazed at the woman in a red dress and continued, “According to my knowledge, evil cultivators went extinct all those years ago.”

“You know quite a lot!” She replied, “You’re right. The evil cultivators incurred public wrath and the other cultivators joined forces to annihilate evil cultivators. But you must realize that it happened in the small universe, and this is the medium universe. Moreover, there were so many evil cultivators, so how could they have possibly annihilated all of them?”

She paused for a moment and continued, “The reason there are so many evil cultivators here is my father.”

“Your father?” Yang Ye was puzzled, “He’s an evil cultivator?”

She nodded, “A very formidable evil cultivator. He was like a founding ancestor amongst them, and he escaped the pursuit of those powerful experts in the small universe. After he arrived in the medium universe, he formed his own organization.”

Yang Ye asked, “And he taught others how to become evil cultivators?”

She shook her head, “He didn’t. because he knew better than anyone about the flaws of this path. After he arrived here, he started to research like a madman. He researched the flaws of evil cultivation, and he hoped to find a method to resolve the side effects of the speed of cultivation that evil cultivators possessed. After countless years of research, he found it, and then he started teaching others!”

Yang Ye glanced at her, “Those people in the city don’t look normal to me!”

She nodded, “They aren’t normal at all. In the beginning, for safety’s sake, he didn’t allow outsiders to cultivate his technique, and he let me do it. He was very strong, so even if there were issues during my cultivation, he would be able to resolve it in time. However, my strength rose rapidly, but nothing happened, so he started to accept disciples.”

Yang Ye asked, “What happened in the end?”

She fell silent for a long time before she replied, “Actually, his method wasn’t wrong. His mistake was that he’d overlooked something, and it was my physique. The reason nothing happened to me was because of my unique physique. But those without such a unique physique showed no signs of suffering any problems in the beginning, but as time passed and they grew stronger, side effects started to appear.”

She closed her eyes at this point, “Unfortunately, it was too late when he found out. Because evil cultivators could cultivate so quickly, it made many go after it like madmen. At that time, people in all the nearby cities had started to cultivate his technique. The only way to stop it was to kill everyone in those cities. That was the only way to prevent the technique from leaking!”

Yang Ye said, “But he didn’t do that!”

She nodded, “He moved all those cities into Moment Mountain, and then sealed it with a formation. His goal was to stop all of them from leaving. Because at that time, many ancient cultivators had arrived in the medium universe. If they left, they would definitely be slaughtered. At the same time, he hoped to find a method to treat these people. Unfortunately, he still wasn’t able to succeed after countless years passed!”

Yang Ye asked, “Your father is still alive?”

She replied, “He is!”

Yang Ye’s eyelids twitched. After all, that was a true ancient cultivator!

Meanwhile, she said, “Unfortunately, he isn’t the same father I knew any longer.”Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Yang Ye asked, “What do you mean?”

She replied, “There were issues in his cultivation too. Actually, evil cultivators gain their strength at an accelerated pace. Things that are built swiftly aren’t strong. Even if external forces are used to fortify it, it still isn’t strong. As time passes, the issues in it will grow.”

Yang Ye nodded. Cultivation couldn’t be rushed. Because the more one rushed, the more likely it was for one to encounter issues with one’s cultivation.

Just like those rotting corpses and blood red figures. Even though they were strong, they’d lost their minds. Or to be more precise, they couldn’t be called people anymore!

Meanwhile, the woman added, “After problems arose in my father’s cultivation, he started to go to extremes and kill at random. No one could stop him. Fortunately, the old man in Daoist’s robes just happened to arrive at that time, and he sealed my father.”

“He didn’t kill him?” asked Yang Ye. As soon as he finished speaking, he knew he’d misspoken and said, “I’m sorry.”

She shook her head slightly in response, “If it was possible, I would have hoped for him to be dead. Because living is worse than death for him right now. That old man wanted to kill him, but he couldn’t!”

He couldn’t?! Yang Ye frowned slightly, “It can’t be, right? Even his strength wasn’t sufficient to kill your father?”

She glanced at Yang Ye and explained, “He was just a clone, and it was even a clone which was about to vanish. So, he could only seal my father, and my father might be about to escape now!”

Yang Ye’s eyelids twitched. If her father escapes, it’ll definitely be a huge problem.

She suddenly asked, “Are there ancient cultivators left in the world outside?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “They’ve gone to the large universe.”

“They’re gone?” She spoke softly, “Then if my father gets out, will anyone in the medium universe be able to stop him? Will anyone be able to stop these rotting corpses, those blood red figures, and those other terrifying monsters?”

Yang Ye shrugged, “I don’t know. In any case, I can’t stop them!”

She remained silent for a long time and gazed at Yang Ye, “You can!”

Yang Ye shrugged, “You think too highly of me.”

Meanwhile, she suddenly appeared before Yang Ye, and then she tapped her right index finger against his chest. She looked him in the eyes and said, “That treasure in you can.”

Yang Ye’s expression changed when he heard this.
