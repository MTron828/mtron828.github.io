Chapter 687 – Saint Xing Yun?

A Half-Saint.... Yang Ye took a long glance at Qin Bufan who was within the arc of light. He knew that Qin Bufan hadn’t said that because he was trying to put on a show of strength, and it was because Half-Saints really were nothing to Qin Bufan. Of course, it didn’t mean that Qin Bufan had the strength to kill Half-Saints, it merely meant that Qin Bufan was confident that Half-Saints couldn’t harm him!

“What? Are you afraid?” Qin Bufan’s resounded abruptly when Yang Ye remained silent.

Yang Ye patted the violet mink and Lei Lin. Both of them understood his intentions and hid within the Primordial Pagoda. After that, he said, “I wouldn’t have come if I was!”

Qin Bufan smiled, “You’re the 1st person in this world who I feel is agreeable. I hope we don’t become enemies in the future. Because I will feel quite regretful if I kill you!”

Yang Ye said, “You look a little bit like me when you act so confidently.”

“Hahaha! I have a slight urge to kill you right now!” Qin Bufan’s roaring laughter resounded from within the arc of light.

Yang Ye paid no further attention to Qin Bufan and just sped up. Qin Bufan didn’t waste his breath anymore and sped forward at full speed as well.

After flying for almost a day, both of them finally arrived at an island.

Bang!

They’d just arrived on the island when an enormous pillar of water suddenly shot into the sky from the ocean.

“Who are you? How dare you trespass upon my territory? Are you tired of living?” A voice resounded before its owner even arrived. As soon as it finished resounding, a bearded man who wore a dark blue robe and held a trident appeared before Yang Ye and Qin Bufan.

A Monarch Realm expert! Yang Ye sensed the aura of a Monarch Realm expert from the bearded man. Moreover, he was at the fifth rank of the Monarch Realm, at least. Yang Ye withdrew his gaze and gazed at Qin Bufan while the latter said, “Don’t look at me, I have no idea as well. I never saw this fellow when I arrived here that day.”

“How presumptuous!” The bearded man shouted furiously, and he pointed his trident at Qin Bufan and said, “Where are the 2 of you from? Don’t you know that this is the territory of I, Hong Man?”

“When did this place ever belong to someone?” asked Qin Bufan.

Hong Man laughed coldly and said, “Looks like both of you came here from somewhere else. The ocean in an area of a few tens of thousands of kilometers belongs to Saint Xing Yun, and I’m the 10th Guardian under Saint Xing Yun’s command and the master of this island. Out of consideration that it’s your first offence, I’ll let the two of you go. But don’t blame me for being merciless if you dare to step foot into my territory again!”

Hong Man’s eyes were fixed on Qin Bufan while he spoke because he sensed that Qin Bufan was a Monarch Realm expert. Moreover, he even felt an aura of danger coming from Qin Bufan!

Saint Xing Yun?

Both Yang Ye and Qin Bufan were stunned when they heard all of this. Saint Xing Yun? A Saint Realm expert? What a joke! Not to mention a Saint Realm expert, there aren’t even any Half-Saints left on the continent besides the Half-Saints of the southern territory!

Yang Ye said, “Saint Xing Yun? Who’s that?”

Hong Man moved his gaze away from Qin Bufan and looked at Yang Ye as he said, “Why’s an ant at the Exalt Realm like you interfering in a conversation between 2 Monarch Realm experts?”

Yang Ye was speechless.

“HAHAHA!” Qin Bufan roared wildly with laughter.

Yang Ye shook his head and said, “Can you just talk normally with me? I promised my wives that I would keep a low profile when I left. I must keep a low profile.”

A wisp of ridicule arose on the corners of Hong Man’s mouth, and he said, “An ant at the Exalt Realm is talking about keeping a low profile? Why don’t you show me how arrogant you can be?”

“Alright, I will!” As soon as Yang Ye finished speaking, he’d already appeared before Hong Man, and then a string of explosions resounded as a fist blasted through the air and smashed down towards Hong Man’s head.

Hong Man’s expression changed drastically because the speed of this ant had completely exceeded his imaginations. He didn’t dare act carelessly in the slightest, and he placed his trident horizontally before him to block Yang Ye’s punch!

Bang!

A muffled bang resounded as the trident broke apart, and then Hong Man was blasted over 1km away before he could finally stop himself.

Pu!

He’d just stopped his figure when a mouthful of blood sprayed from between his lips, and then he gazed at Yang Ye with astonishment and said, “You.... You.... You.... You....” He was quite dazed from being blasted flying by a single punch from an Exalt Realm profounder. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Yang Ye said flatly, “Can we talk properly now?”

“You....” Hong Man glared angrily at Yang Ye. He wanted to attack, but he didn’t. In the end, he glanced at Qin Bufan, and then shot a glance at Yang Ye before he said, “You.... Just you wait! Don’t leave if you dare! Just you wait!” As he spoke, he’d transformed into a ray of light that vanished from Yang Ye and Qin Bufan’s fields of vision.

He fled just like that?

Both of them were stunned because a Monarch Realm expert had immediately turned around and fled....

“Do you think Saint Xing Yun is a Half-Saint?” Qin Bufan spoke abruptly.

Yang Ye pondered deeply for a short moment and said, “It’s not very probable. My southern territory would have definitely found out if there are more Half-Saints on the continent. I’m quite curious as well. I wonder who that fellow, Saint Xing Yun, is to actually dare to call himself a saint!”

Qin Bufan spoke abruptly, “What do you plan to do if he’s really a Half-Saint?”

Yang Ye said, “He hasn’t offended us, so do we have to do anything? Moreover, what can we do? Even if I use the Stone of Suppression to suppress his cultivation, do you think our joint forces are sufficient to kill a Half-Saint?”

“It isn’t!” said Qin Bufan. The reason Yang Ye and him were able to kill a Half-Saint that day was mainly because that Half-Saint of the Hallowed Grounds was already heavily injured. Their current strengths were utterly insufficient to kill a Half-Saint who was completely unharmed, and it was even to the extent that the slightest mistake might cost them their lives!

Bang!

Suddenly, a huge explosion resounded from afar, and then over 30 rays of light appeared within their fields of vision. It wasn’t long before those rays of light arrived before them.

The person in the lead was an old man in a grey robe. His aura surged like a powerful river, but he wasn’t a Half-Saint and was merely a ninth rank Monarch Realm expert at most!

Amongst the 30 plus figures by the grey robed old man’s side, there were actually 10 Monarch Realm experts if Hong Man was included! Moreover, the rest were ninth rank Exalt Realm experts!

A wisp of surprise flashed through Yang Ye’s eyes. He hadn’t expected that there would actually be such a force in this distant ocean in the south!

“Saint Xing Yun, they trespassed upon my island and threatened to teach you a lesson!” Hong Man pointed at Yang Ye while resentment filled his eyes.

The old man grunted coldly, and then his gaze swept past Qin Bufan and descended onto Yang Ye in the end. He was stunned when he saw Yang Ye, and he took another careful look. In the end, he seemed to have confirmed something, and he revealed astonishment from his eyes while his hands couldn’t help but tremble.

“Kill them! They actually dared to attack someone from our alliance? They’re really courting death!”

“Tsk, tsk! A Monarch Realm expert and an Exalt Realm expert, yet they actually dared to trespass on our territory. They really don’t know what’s good for them. Hong Man, you’re such a failure. You actually weren’t even able to deal with a single Monarch Realm expert and an Exalt Realm profounder!”

“Wait, wait! I think that fellow in that arc of light should be quite strong. Why don’t we let him join us? In any case, our alliance doesn’t have sufficient forces yet. Right, as for that fellow at the Exalt Realm, we have no need for him. Someone has to die when our Starcloud Alliance is offended, otherwise, it will probably be difficult for us to deter those oceanic clans and independent cultivators!”

The other profounders behind the old man hadn’t noticed the state he was in right now, and they were speaking successively. Moreover, some had even started circulating their profound energy and were prepared to attack.

Hong Man was filled with confidence when he heard them, and he gazed at Yang Ye with a ferocious expression as he said, “Kid, weren’t you very haughty just now? Didn’t you want to act arrogantly? Fucking do it again right now! Come on, let me see....”

Slap!

The old man suddenly turned around and slapped Hong Man, causing the latter to be blasted flying.

All the others were stunned by this sudden scene.

The old man gazed at Yang Ye as he forced out a smile that was even more unsightly than a weeping face, “Are.... Are you Yang Ye?”

Yang Ye!

The countenances of all the other profounders behind the old man instantly turned ghastly pale, and terror arose in their eyes.

Yang Ye frowned and said, “You recognize me?”

The old man’s smile grew even more unsightly when he heard this. He suddenly bowed to Yang Ye and said, “Supreme Elder of the Starcloud Sect, Liu He, greets the Sword Master!”

“Sword Master!” All the others behind the old man hurriedly bowed and spoke respectfully.

“The Starcloud Sect?” Yang Ye frowned as he hadn’t heard of such a sect.

Liu He explained, “My Starcloud Sect is an Eighth Rank Sect from the central territory. We pledged our allegiance to the southern territory while you were cultivating behind closed doors. After that, Miss Ding sent us here to pay attention to the oceanic clans at all times. The oceanic clans yielded 2 days ago, so we....”

“So you occupied this place as your own, right?” Yang Ye spoke indifferently.

The old man’s figure trembled. Right at this moment, a distant expanse of the ocean started to ripple violently, and then a few thousand men and women with the upper body of a human, the lower body of a fish, and held tridents in their hands shot out from the ocean there.

The countenances of Liu He and the others turned even paler when they witnessed this scene.

“Shameless human! Hand over my younger sister or we’ll fight you to the death even if that fellow, Demon Yang, comes here from the central territory!” An extremely handsome man led the group. At this moment, his face was covered in rage, and so were the other mermaids and mermen behind him.

“What’s going on?” Yang Ye frowned as he asked this question.

The old man’s lips twitched but not a single word escaped his lips.
