Chapter 1243 – The Residents Of Sword God’s Palace!

The sword was extremely swift like a flash of lightning, so even Yang Ye hadn’t been able to react before it arrived in front of him. However, it was instantly blasted away when it was about to stab his skin.

Yang Ye who possessed Rebirth Rank sword intent was practically immune to sword intent below the Rebirth Rank!

Actually, it wasn’t just sword intent below the Rebirth Rank, even other intents that hadn’t arrived at the Rebirth Rank would find it difficult to pose any threat to him. However, he possessed sword intent, so it possessed an absolute suppressive effect towards sword intent that was weaker to his own.

Yang Ye looked up. He saw a middle aged man with a black sword chest on his back standing not too far away, and there was strong killing intent and viciousness within the middle aged man’s eyes.

He was someone from Sword God’s Palace!

The middle aged man’s gaze descended onto Yang Ye, and he pointed his sword at Yang Ye as he spoke fiercely, “Damnable outsider!”

As soon as he finished speaking, a strand of sword intent surged out from within him, and then his sword transformed into a ray of light that shot forward. It was extremely swift to the point it seemed like just a thread.

Yang Ye stretched out his hand, and it didn’t take long for a sword to stop before his palm.

The middle aged man’s pupils constricted, “How could that be possible?”

Yang Ye sized up the middle aged man and said, “If I’m not wrong, that body doesn’t belong to you. You seized the body of another, right?”

The middle aged man replied coldly, “So what if I did?”

“It doesn’t matter!” Yang Ye continued, “How many are there in Sword God’s Palace? Where are they?”

The middle aged man gazed at Yang Ye for a short while, and then he suddenly formed seals. After that, over 100 rays of light suddenly shot up into the air in the surroundings, and they shot towards Yang Ye and Yun Banqing.

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly as he took a step forward, and then a strand of terrifying sword intent appeared in the surroundings. The rays of light instantly dispersed while the middle aged man was even pushed back repeatedly for over 3km!

“Sword intent above the Void Rank! How could that be possible? How could that be possible?” The middle aged man gazed at Yang Ye as if he was looking at a monster, and his eyes were filled with shock and disbelief.

“How could this be possible?” Yang Ye’s figure flashed and instantly appeared before the middle aged man, and then his sword intent pressed down upon the middle aged man, “How many people from Sword God’s Palace are still surviving like you?”

The middle aged man gazed at Yang Ye and asked, “Who... who exactly are you?”

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly, “Now, I’m the one asking the questions!”

The middle aged man gazed at Yang Ye for a long time before he said, “Around 30!”

Yang Ye frowned, “Only 30....”

The middle aged man said, “Seizing the bodies of others results in success and failure. Moreover, many seniors weren’t willing to do so all those years ago, and they chose to ignite their souls instead....”

Yang Ye asked, “Why?”

The middle aged man glanced at Yang Ye and said, “Taking the body of another is against the laws of nature. Moreover, even if you do take the body of another, it wouldn’t be your own, so the soul and body wouldn’t be fully compatible. Thus, not only would your cultivation and strength drop, it’s impossible to ever advance throughout your lifetime. So, seizing the body of another is only capable of allowing us to prolong our lives for some time.”

Yang Ye pondered deeply for a short moment and said, “You probably have a leader, right?”

The middle aged man nodded in response.

Yang Ye said, “Take me to see your leader!”

The middle aged man hesitated for a moment before he nodded.

Just like that, the 3 of them started walking towards the depths of the ruins under the middle aged man’s lead.

During their conversations, Yang Ye found out that the middle aged man’s name was Xing Feng. He’d been an Emperor who possessed Void Rank sword intent. But after he seized the body of another, the lack of compatibility between his soul and the new body caused his cultivation to drop to the Quasi Emperor Realm while his sword intent dropped to the Quasi Void Rank. However, he’d cultivated bitterly to finally regain Void Rank sword intent. But it was impossible for his cultivation to rise again throughout his life.

Xing Feng asked, “You came from the outside?”

Yang Ye nodded.

“That’s impossible!” Xing Feng was bewildered, “Sword cultivators can’t step foot on Sword God Island. As soon as they do, that mysterious expert will definitely attack. Even though your strength is formidable, there should be quite a gap between you and that mysterious expert.”

Yang Ye said, “I concealed the aura of my sword intent and the aura of a sword cultivator that I possess.”

Xing Feng instantly revealed a trace of fervor when he heard this and said, “How did you conceal it? Can you teach it to us?” He’d been trapped here for countless years, so he naturally wanted to leave.

Yang Ye shook his head slightly, “It can’t be taught!” He’d relied on the Sword Domain to conceal his aura, but they didn’t possess the Sword Domain. So, it was naturally impossible for them to conceal their aura. Of course, he could use the Sword Domain to help them conceal their aura. However, he had to observe them before deciding if he would take them with him.

They’d lived for countless years and had relied on seizing the bodies of others to survive. So, bringing them out of here might cause trouble for him instead.

A wisp of disappointment flashed through his eyes when he heard Yang Ye, but he didn’t say anything.

Yang Ye was ceaselessly sizing up the surroundings as they traveled. Even though the surroundings were covered in ruins, it wasn’t difficult to discern how grand and magnificent Sword God’s Palace used to be.

Suddenly, the middle aged man stopped and turned around to look at Yang Ye, “Someone nearby is requesting help....”

Yang Ye asked, “A member of Sword God’s Palace?”

The middle aged man nodded, “Many have come here lately. For the sake of preventing Sword God’s Palace from being destroyed by them, our forces have sent out to step them. Now, someone is in trouble. That person should have encountered an Emperor from the outside world, and it might not be just one!”

Yang Ye replied, “Come, let’s go have a look!”

The middle aged man nodded slightly, and then he sped up towards the right.

Yang Ye and Yun Banqing followed behind him.

It didn’t take long for the 3 of them to hear sounds of battle coming from afar, causing the middle aged man to travel even faster. In next to no time, they saw a green robed man with a black sword chest on his back being besieged by 2 old men.

The 2 old men immediately stopped attacking upon noticing Yang Ye’s group, and they gazed at them with vigilance.

Meanwhile, one of the old men suddenly gazed at Yang Ye and Yun Banqing, “Both of you are outsiders!”

Yang Ye gazed at the old man and said, “You’ve seen us?”

The old man replied, “I saw you on the shuttle. I never expected that you would have escaped Manager Qin.”

Yang Ye glanced at the old man and said, “Leave.”

“Leave?” The old man laughed coldly, “We can leave. Ask them to hand over the treasures of Sword God’s Palace and we’ll leave.”

“Treasures?” Xing Feng spoke coldly, “My Sword God’s Palace does possess some treasures, but I wonder if you’ll be alive to enjoy them.”

The old man laughed coldly, “Do you think the Sword God’s Palace is still the same as it was all those years ago? Take a clear look at it. The Sword God’s Palace is already part of the continent’s past. As for all of you, you don’t even dare to leave these ruins. Hahaha!”

“Are trash like you even qualified to talk about my Sword God’s Palace?” Suddenly, a voice resounded in the sky, and then a beautiful woman in palace attire appeared here. Her gaze descended onto the old man as she said, “Even if my Sword God’s Palace has suffered decline now, it’s still extremely easy for us to kill trash like you!”

As soon as she finished speaking, she tapped her finger forward. In an instant, countless strands of sword energy flashed forward and formed a dense wave of sword energy that shot towards the 2 old men.

Yang Ye’s eyes instantly narrowed slightly at the sight of this. The beautiful woman’s sword intent was at the Void Rank, but her sword intent was much more solid than how his had been before he’d burned it away!

The old men were shocked when she attacked, and they attacked in unison. It didn’t take long for numerous sword howls and explosions to resound.

She was suppressing them!

As soon as they fought, the 2 old men were completely suppressed, and they could only defend themselves passively yet were practically incapable of fighting back!

Yun Banqing spoke softly, “How strong!”

“Of course!” Xing Feng continued, “Elder Yu is the number 2 expert amongst us. Not to mention 2 Emperors, she wouldn’t even fear 5!”

Yang Ye nodded slightly, “She’s strong indeed!” It could be said that the beautiful woman was the strongest amongst the Emperors he’d seen, and she was even much stronger than Jian Xu, Jian Ji, and the leader of the World Devastator Cult.

Xing Feng glanced at Yang Ye and remained silent. As for the green robed man by Xing Feng’s side, he glared angrily at Xing Feng and said, “Xing Feng, what are you doing with outsiders?”

Xing Feng replied, “Ning Tao, I’ll explain later.”

Ning Tao was about to speak when 2 shrill cries suddenly resounded from the side.

Yang Ye and the others looked towards the source of the shrill cries, and they saw countless rays of ghastly light suddenly appear there. The rays of light were like droplets of rain that completely enveloped the 2 old men. A few breaths of time later, the light dispersed, and the 2 old men appeared before their eyes. At this moment, the 3 old men seemed like their entire bodies had been pierced by arrows and were covered in dense bloody holes. Both the old men gazed at her with astonishment, but it didn’t take long for the color in their eyes to fade. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“Trash!” She grunted coldly as she waved her right hand, and a wave of light shot out and transformed their corpses into piles of mush.

Xing Feng and the other green robed man quickly bowed to the beautiful woman and spoke respectfully, “Elder Yu!”

She nodded slightly, and then she gazed at Yang Ye and Yun Banqing. Right when she saw Yun Banqing, her eyes instantly narrowed, and she quickly sized her up. In next to no time, a trace of pleasant surprise flashed through her eyes, “Not bad. You’ve attained the Quasi Emperor Realm at such a young age. Your natural talent is probably not bad. After so many years, a pretty acceptable girl has finally come here.”

Yun Banqing frowned, and she had a bad feeling as she said, “Senior, what are you trying to say?”

“What am I trying to say?” A cold smile curled up on the corners of her mouth, “I intend to take your body, of course!”

As soon as she finished speaking, she stretched out her hand to grab Yun Banqing.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly appeared before Yun Banqing, and he gazed at the beautiful woman as he said, “I’ll give you another chance to reorganize your thoughts and speak again!”
