Chapter 2789 – Sacrifice Yourselves to My Dao!

The sword cultivator looked down at his sword, and it gradually calmed down.

The sword cultivator looked in a certain direction, and then he grinned and continued forward.

The Four Dimensional Universe.

When Yang Ye charged at the mysterious expert and Monarch Yan, Tian Xiu and the others knew that he would die!

However, they were stunned when they saw his attack.

Meanwhile, Monarch Yan and the mysterious expert’s faces changed drastically!

A moment ago, they felt that unless the strongest form of Destiny was here, no one could possibly save Yang Ye!

Yang Ye was bound for death!

It was what they thought just a moment ago!

But at this moment, those thoughts had vanished.

When a sword cultivator forgot life and death, and had just a clear mind, it represented that sword cultivator’s sword carried both the Sword Dao of Emotion and the Emotionless Sword Dao.

Emotionless because of emotion!

Especially when that sword cultivator was already at the Ordinary Sword Realm!

Monarch Yan was the first to attack.

At this moment, his aura instantly rose explosively. At the same time, the fiery red lightning in his grasp slashed at Yang Ye like a fiery saber.

Yang Ye’s sword descended. Unlike before, it was soundless and without any fluctuations of energy, and it didn’t even emanate a glow, sword intent, or sword energy!

It was unusually calm!

The sword descended. A moment later, it struck the fiery red lightning, and it didn’t stop at all as it continued down. Meanwhile, the fiery red lightning was sliced into two and soundlessly turned ethereal.

It didn’t cause any loud noise or surge of energy!

The sword arrived above Monarch Yan. The latter didn’t choose to go head-on against this. He tapped his right foot down and floated backward!

The sword continued down!

Monarch Yan’s body exploded in the distance!

But just a moment later, his shattered body actually healed on its own. However, it was ethereal!

“Annihilation of Life!” Meanwhile, a voice resounded in Yang Ye’s ears.

A moment later, numerous thumb-sized specks of black light appeared in the space around Yang Ye. They were like numerous tiny black holes that were madly devouring everything around Yang Ye.

Actually, they were black holes, but they were shrunk down from numerous huge black holes.

The devouring force they possessed was something that could even destroy Tian Xiu’s Omni Ruin!

Yang Ye took a step back and raised his right hand. The Sword Precursor stood on his palm. When the black specks of light surged at him, the Sword Precursor suddenly started spinning rapidly.

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!

Rays of sword energy bloomed like flowers as they rippled toward the surroundings!

As soon as the sword energy and black specks of light came into contact, they shook violently, and then the space in the surroundings suddenly turned ethereal. Two breaths of time later, a huge expanse of space around Yang Ye and the mysterious expert had turned pitch black.

However, the sword energy and black specks of light were still there!

They were still colliding intensely.

However, they didn’t remain in a stalemate for long. The mysterious expert suddenly shot backward because Qi Bitian and the others had arrived.

They stood before Yang Ye, and the mysterious expert and Monarch Yan didn’t attack either.

As for the Destiny Realm experts in the surroundings, they didn’t dare to attack at all!

Tian Xiu gazed coldly at Monarch Yan. She was about to attack when the Destiny Realm experts around them retreated. Meanwhile, the mysterious expert led the experts of the End World back into the floating city.

Monarch Yan and the mysterious expert stood on the city walls!

The woman in white glanced at them and said, “Let’s go!”

Qi Bitian and Tian Xiu nodded, and then they vanished into the distance with Yang Ye.

On the city walls, the mysterious expert suddenly said, “What a pity!”

Monarch Yan spoke softly, “It is a pity. Not only has he attained the Ordinary Sword Realm, he has grasped a new type of the Sword Dao, and that Sword Dao… I’m afraid it’s only inferior to those two sword cultivators!”

The mysterious expert gazed at Monarch Yan and was puzzled, “Two?”

Monarch Yan replied softly, “A sword cultivator in a cloud white robe. He’s very strong.”

The mysterious expert asked, “How strong?”

Monarch Yan fell silent for an instant and replied, “I have no confidence in winning, even if I use all my trump cards. Of course, that woman is even more terrifying. She has always been a mystery!”

The mysterious expert shot a glance up into space. At a point above the clouds, there was a simply godlike woman looking down upon the living beings below the clouds!

A short while later, the mysterious expert suddenly spoke softly, “What about our plan?”

Monarch Yan nodded, “It’s almost there.”

The mysterious expert said, “Hurry it up, even if there’s a price to pay!”

Monarch Yan nodded.Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

…

Three Dimensional Universe. A point in outer space.

A part of space cracked open, and then a few figures flashed out from there. It was Yang Ye and the others.

As soon as they appeared, Tian Xiu gazed at Yang Ye, and then she swung a punch at him. Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly crashed to the ground.

Tian Xiu was shocked, and her punch was unfurled into a palm that caught Yang Ye’s falling figure.

“He's very seriously injured!” The woman in white spoke solemnly, “Send him into the pagoda!”

Tian Xiu hurriedly placed the Primordial Pagoda into Yang Ye, and then She took Yang Ye into it.

Outside the pagoda, Qi Bitian and the woman in white didn’t head inside. Qi Bitian glanced at the woman in white, “You’re not like the rest of them!”

The woman in white grinned. Of course she knew who Qi Bitian was speaking about.

Qi Bitian looked up at the distant starry sky, “Those two didn’t use their full strength earlier, right?”

The woman in white nodded.

Qi Bitian spoke softly, “How strong are they?”

She pondered deeply for a moment and replied, “Greater than us, weaker than her.”

Qi Bitian’s eyes narrowed slightly, “How strong is she?”

The woman in white glanced at Qi Bitian, “It would take less than three attacks for her to kill me!”

In an instant, the area fell silent.

A short while passed before the woman in white spoke, “I’m leaving.”

Qi Bitian asked, “Where are you going?”

She grinned, “To the other two forms of me. It’s time for us to meet. Otherwise, we may never have another chance. Take care!”

The woman in white transformed into a ray of sword energy that vanished into the boundless sky.

Qi Bitian watched her leave in silence.

In the Primordial Pagoda.

Yang Ye laid there on the Ascension Platform. Su Qingshi and all the other people and demon beasts in the Primordial Pagoda were standing around the platform.

All of them had extremely solemn expressions on their faces as they gazed at Yang Ye’s figure.

Snowy was releasing all kinds of spirit energy while crying as she stood before Yang Ye. She was extremely sad, and her tears were flowing like a river.

The hearts of the others ached from the sight of this!

With the help of the Primordial Violet Energy and Snowy’s special spirit energy, Yang Ye’s injuries were gradually healing.

Su Qingshi and the others heaved a sigh of relief when they witnessed this!

The demons seemed to visibly relax as well. After being by Yang Ye’s side for so long, they had naturally formed feelings of friendship toward him.

Around an hour later, Yang Ye suddenly opened his eyes, and the first thing he saw was Snowy’s chubby face.

Snowy scratched Yang Ye’s face gently with her tiny paws and cracked a smile.

Yang Ye grinned, and then he stood up and glanced at the surroundings. His smile grew brighter when he saw all the familiar faces here.

Yang Ye spoke softly, “All of you are here!”

Snowy hurriedly nodded while Su Qingshi and the others started crying instead.

When Yang Ye charged at Monarch Yan and the mysterious expert, no one could understand the despair they felt!

At that moment, their hearts had stopped!

Yang Ye stood up and went to hug all of them, even the demon beasts.

When he chose to die, he realized how important all of them were to him. At that time, his mind was blank. Actually, this blankness wasn’t thinking about nothing, but rather it was thinking about everything.

At that moment, he hadn’t just attained the Sword Dao of Fate, he’d attained the Emotionless Sword Dao!

Emotionlessness wasn’t being heartless, it was emotionless for emotion.

The Sword Dao of Emotion included the Emotionless Sword Dao!

Yang Ye left the Primordial Pagoda while Snowy fell asleep on his shoulder. Now, Snowy refused to leave Yang Ye for even a moment, not even while she slept. She insisted on sleeping on his shoulder. Yang Ye felt rather helpless toward this, and of course, his heart ached as well!

The little fellow was so worried about him!

She’d lost Erya, and she would collapse if she lost him too!

Tian Xiu glanced at Snowy’s snoring figure, and then she gazed at Yang Ye, “What do you plan to do now?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “Take it one step at a time!”

Tian Xiu nodded, “Your current strength is at the peak of the Three Dimensional Universe. It can be said that perhaps only a handful are capable of killing you on their own. However, don’t underestimate Monarch Yan and that mysterious expert. They are formidable.”

Yang Ye nodded. Even at the end, he could still sense that they hadn’t used their full strengths during the last battle!

They were still concealing their strength!

Yang Ye knew that they still hadn’t treated him as their greatest opponent. It wasn’t that they were looking down on him, but the woman above the clouds was too strong!

The woman above the clouds!

Yang Ye looked up and wondered how strong she really was!

Tian Xiu suddenly said, “We’re leaving!”

Yang Ye moved his gaze back to Tian Xiu, “Where are you going?”

Tian Xiu and Qi Bitian exchanged glances. In the end, Qi Bitian smiled, “According to our inference, no matter what that woman is planning, she should be making a move soon. We want to seize this final period of time to go look for something.

Yang Ye asked curiously, “What?”

Qi Bitian smiled, “You’ll know when the time comes.”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

Tian Xiu walked over to Yang Ye, and her figure gradually soared into the air. She stopped when her head towered over Yang Ye’s head. She patted him on the shoulder and said, “I’ll be there when you need me!”

She turned around and vanished into the sky with Qi Bitian.

Somewhere in the clouds.

The woman gazed at the Go board before her with a smile on the corners of her mouth while ceaselessly flipping a Go piece between her right index and middle fingers!

Meanwhile, a shadow sat before her.

She put the piece down, “I want the Three Dimensional Universe destroyed! 10 days! Nothing must be alive in the Three Dimensional Universe within 10 days! Can you do that?”

The shadow fell silent for a moment and shook his head.

The woman waved her right hand, and Justice vanished from the side. A moment later, a sword appeared above the floating city in the Four Dimensional Universe and descended.

Boom!

A pitch black barrier of light appeared in the air above the city. Meanwhile, the sword descended.

Bang!

The terrifying barrier of light exploded apart! It had been shattered with such ease…

High above in the clouds. The shadow suddenly howled with fury, “Why don’t you do it yourself?!”

She glanced at him, “Do you know what my Dao is?”

She didn’t wait for the shadow to reply and grinned, “The Fate Dao. With but a thought, the world grows and flourishes; and with just a single thought, everything changes. I’ve accomplished the former.”

She walked over to the divine tree at the side, looked down beneath the clouds, and spoke softly, “Living beings of the world, sacrifice yourselves to my Dao!”
