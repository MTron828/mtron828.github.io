Chapter 2676 – I Don’t Want It!

The surroundings fell silent!

Yang Ye stood there while Heaven Executor was just pointed at him.

Meanwhile, Snowy appeared on Yang Ye’s shoulder.

Snowy gazed at the sword and frowned. She was about to grab it but Yang Ye stopped her.

Yang Ye looked up at the sky. He didn’t sense anything, but he knew that person was behind this!

The original owner of Heaven Executor!

Destiny!

Only its original owner could make Heaven Executor point itself at him!

“Haha…” Mo Yu suddenly started to laugh madly, “See that? See? Haha! Your sword isn’t even yours! It isn’t yours!”

Yang Ye ignored Mo Yu’s ramblings and looked up at the sky, “It’s quite unfair to me.”

He received no reply, but Heaven Executor was still pointed at him!

Obviously, he wasn’t allowed to kill Mo Yu!

Yang Ye gazed at the sword for a long time. Suddenly, another sword appeared in his grasp.

Past Life!

Yang Ye took it in both hands and swung it!

It struck Heaven Executor, but it didn’t move at all. Conversely, Yang Ye was blasted over 3km away!

Moreover, a mark had appeared on his throat!

It merely cut through his skin!

A warning!

It was clearly a warning to Yang Ye.

“Haha…” Mo Yu roared madly with laughter and glanced coldly at Yang Ye, “I’ll come for you again! Just you wait!”

He transformed into a ray of light that vanished into the sky.

Once Mo Yu left, Heaven Executor trembled slightly and moved into a vertical position.

Yang Ye glanced at the sky, “I’m very vengeful.”

He received no reply.

Yang Ye didn’t say anything and just left.

Meanwhile, Heaven Executor suddenly floated over to Yang Ye. Yang Ye grabbed it and hurled it into the sky, “Fuck off! I don’t want you anymore!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye vanished into the distance.

Heaven Executor floated there quietly, and some time passed before it abruptly transformed into a ray of light that vanished on the spot.

Yang Ye shot through space on his sword, and his face was extremely gloomy.

A humiliation!

This incident was a humiliation to him!

Weak!

He'd only been humiliated because he was weak!

Improve his strength!

An hour later, Yang Ye arrived at the Eternal River.

He glanced at the surroundings and entered the Primordial Pagoda.

At this moment, only the members of the Ancient Sword Sect and Su Qingshi and the others were left in the Primordial Pagoda. The members of the Ancient Sword Sect were aware of the Primordial Pagoda’s existence. It could be considered as Yang Ye’s own world.

Gu Nie led the members of the Ancient Sword Sect to Yang Ye.

Yang Ye was quite puzzled, “All of you plan to leave?”

Gu Nie nodded.

Yang Ye was still quite puzzled, “Why?”

Gu Nie glanced at the surroundings and said, “Spirit energy is abundant here, but we lost many possibilities here. We sword cultivators cannot just sit at one spot and cultivate! We must experience things!”

“The End World!” Yang Ye spoke solemnly, “It’s dangerous out there!”

Gu Nie laughed bitterly, “That’s why we want to go outside. If we just hide here, our mental state will never improve. Of course, we will conceal our identities out there, and we’ll split up.”

Yang Ye fell silent.

Gu Nie continued, “The Ancient Sword Sect won’t cease to exist, and we’ll come back together when the time is right. As for you, you’ll always be our sect master. You’re the only sect master in our hearts.

Yang Ye glanced at them. He saw many familiar faces in the ground like Lu Yunxian. Not many from the Ancient Sword Sect had survived, but all of them were elites among elites.

Yang Ye fell silent for a short while before looking at Snowy. The latter nodded and waved her paw. Countless Divine Crystals appeared before Gu Nie and the others.

Yang Ye spoke softly, “Take care out there.”

Gu Nie nodded and said, “You too, Sect Master. No matter where you are, so long as you need us, we’ll be there.”

Yang Ye grinned, “Just take care of yourselves out there. And the Ancient Sword Sect can’t be allowed to vanish. So, from this moment onward, all of you are a sect master of the Ancient Sword Sect. You can start your own sects or do something else. However, no matter what you do, I hope all of you don’t fight and kill each other. Otherwise, I’d be very disappointed. Alright?”

Gu Nie replied seriously, “Don’t worry, we will absolutely not do that.”

Yang Ye nodded, and then he glanced at them, “Take care!”

The others cupped their fists, “Take care, Sect Master!”

A short while later, they took the Divine Crystals and left.

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings. The Primordial Pagoda was slightly emptier again!

As if she could sense how Yang Ye was feeling, Snowy flew over to Yang Ye’s shoulder and gently rubbed her head against his face.

Yang Ye rubbed Snowy’s head and smiled, “I’m fine.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he brought Snowy over to Erya. At this moment, she was deep in the mountains, and loud explosions resounded there from time to time.

Erya had gone mad cultivating that technique!𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Now, she practically never played and just spent most of her time cultivating. She rarely spent time going around the place with Snowy!

Yang Ye didn’t disturb Erya. He knew that she wanted to grow stronger. It was because their enemies were very, very strong right now!

Yang Ye played with Snowy for a while before leaving the Primordial Pagoda.

Yang Ye saw a familiar figure by the Eternal River.

The woman in white.

Yang Ye walked over, and she glanced at him and grinned, “You feel wronged?”

Obviously, she knew what had happened during the battle with Mo Yu.

Yang Ye shook his head, “I just think it’s quite unfair.”

The woman in white smiled, “You even returned that sword to her. Looks like you’re quite resentful.”

Yang Ye spoke solemnly, “Since it could point itself at me, why would I keep it?”

She smiled and walked along the river, “Do you know why I’m fond of staying here?”

Yang Ye shook his head.

She replied softly, “I had some good times here, times without war and fighting. In the past, it was very peaceful here. Unfortunately, as more and more people found this place, it wasn’t that peaceful anymore.”

She gazed at Yang Ye and smiled, “In the beginning, I tried to influence them with reason and kindness. Unfortunately, I failed. Sometimes, people are like that. The more you attempt to reason with them, the more they would refuse to listen. In the end, I realized that just reason alone wouldn’t work, and at most times, killing a few people would do the trick.”

As she spoke, she suddenly waved her hands.

In an instant, the entire Eternal River was split open.

Yang Ye saw a pile of corpses below the river.

Yang Ye gazed at the woman in white, and she nodded, “I killed them. As for how many there are, I can’t remember. All I do know is that I used a little too much strength, and then all of them died here.”

Yang Ye was stunned speechless.

The woman in white suddenly sat on a rock and looked off into the distance, “They don’t know, they don’t know anything about what we sacrificed in order to give the living beings of this universe true freedom. We sacrificed too, too much. However, those who came after us just kept destroying this universe we sacrificed our lives to save.”

She gazed at Yang Ye once more and continued, “Extraordinarily strong experts feel no pity. They feel no pity for the world, nor do they cherish the world. All they care about is growing stronger, growing stronger like madmen. They are willing to sacrifice everything, even the living beings of a world.”

Yang Ye fell silent.

She looked into the distant sky, “Taking and destroying.”

She gazed at Yang Ye and continued, “If you become very, very strong one day, would you be willing to treat the living beings of this world with kindness?”

Yang Ye smiled wryly, “I really want to say yes, because it would make you happy. But I’m sure you’ve realized that this world isn’t very friendly at most times.”

The woman in white smiled, “I know. Just kindness alone cannot manage this world, and just evil alone won’t work either. Of course, I’m just asking you about it. Will you treat this world with kindness if that day comes?”

Yang Ye rubbed his nose, "Does she want me to be the guardian of this world?”

She smiled, “Actually, I already know your answer.”

She waved her right hand, and Past Life appeared in her grasp.

She gazed at the sword and said, “My other form, the owner of Heaven Executor… She brought up Mo Yu, and she had very high hopes for him. Unfortunately, she was disappointed. Even then, she couldn't bear to kill him. So, she made the other form of me, the one you call the woman in black, imprison him. When you tried to kill him earlier, it was the owner of the Heaven Executor who stopped you.”

Yang Ye fell silent.

She gazed at Yang Ye and continued, “Of course, I’m on your side because I chose you.”

Yang Ye glanced at her and said, “Thank you. I guarantee that if the living beings of this universe don’t betray me or try to harm me, then I won’t do that to them.”

Because of Snowy, he actually felt a certain sense of closeness toward the sprites and living beings of this world!

She gazed at him for a long time and floated up slowly into the air. A short while later, she was in front of Yang Ye, and she looked down at him while holding his face. She pressed her forehead against his and spoke softly, “Its name is Past Life, and it is from the World of Past Life. If you wish to truly master it, you must master the Energy of Past Life. Here, feel it for yourself…”

As soon as she said that, Yang Ye’s figure instantly stiffened, and then his eyes opened wide. A strand of mysterious energy started devouring him.
