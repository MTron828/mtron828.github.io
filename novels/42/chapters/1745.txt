Chapter 1746 - A Tooth For A Tooth!

I’ll annihilate your family!

Yang Ye’s icy cold voice resounded through the surroundings.

Beg Yang Xiao to recall those True Realm experts that were heading to Merak System?

Yang Ye had never held such a thought. Because he was very well aware that he would only be asking for insults if he begged Yang Xiao. Moreover, even after he was insulted, Yang Xiao would still not recall those experts.

So, Yang Ye decided to give a tooth for a tooth!

Yang Xiao’s face was extremely unsightly when he saw Yang Ye kill over a dozen of them, and then he charged at Yang Ye.

However, it only took a moment for a huge ball of lightning to appear before him.

Bang!

The ball of lightning exploded apart, and Yang Xiao was blasted over 1km away. At the same time, fine threads of lightning appeared in a huge area around Yang Xiao. They flickered incessantly, and the powerful energy contained within them caused space to tremble violently.

Yang Xiao vanished on the spot again. At the same time, Yang Lianshuang waved her hand forward lightly, and then a few dozen bolts of lightning moved forward in a horizontal wave.

Bang!

An explosion resounded, and Yang Xiao was pushed over 300m back!

Yang Xiao looked at Yang Lianshuang. He stared at her as he said, “Yang Lianshuang, many of them are your cousin brothers and sisters!” The biggest problem for him was Yang Ye and not Yang Lianshuang.

Because Yang Ye was all alone, but Yang Lianshuang had a huge number of experts from the Yang Clan relying on her!

“Cousin brothers and sisters?” Yang Lianshuang laughed coldly, “Yang Xiao, do you know why I’m so determined to seize the position of patriarch in the Yang Clan?”

She didn’t wait for Yang Xiao to answer her and continued, “Besides what my mother said, there’s one more reason. It’s because I think you’re not worthy of being the patriarch. Do you remember when my mother brought me along to beg you to protect us? But you didn’t even agree to meet her!”

Yang Lianshuang’s face was covered in ferocity as she spoke up to this point, “You only had to say a word and my mother wouldn’t have been tortured to death. But as far as you were concerned, both my mother and I were insignificant. So, you didn’t even meet her, and so she died!”

Yang Xiao spoke in a low voice, “That’s why you hate me?”

“Hate you?” A cold smile curled up on the corners of Yang Lianshuang’s mouth, “No, I don’t hate you. I hate the system that the Yang Clan runs on. This system where everyone’s worth is determined by natural talent, strength, and the benefits they can provide.”

Everyone here fell silent when they heard this.

Familial love didn’t exist in the Yang Clan!

Actually, the Yang Clan wasn’t alone in this. Every clan could be said to be devoid of familial love. If one had potential and natural talent, the clan would focus on fostering that person and treat that person well. However, those without natural talent and potential wouldn’t even be treated like they were human.

However, it was much more bluntly displayed in the Yang Clan!

Actually, it was normal for them to act like that.

Meanwhile, Yang Lianshuang continued, “I understand that those with natural talent and potential represent that they have a future, and those with a future would naturally be fostered and protected by the clan. However, what about those without natural talent and potential? Tell me, would anyone foster someone without a future? But can natural talent and potential decide everything? Even if someone has no potential or natural talent now, will it always be that way?”

Silence filled the surroundings.

Yang Lianshuang suddenly pointed at Yang Ye, “His father was a central pillar of our Yang Clan. However, as soon as something happened to his father, how did the Yang Clan treat him? Yes, his father wasn’t suited to be the patriarch anymore, but did the Yang Clan have to force him into a hopeless situation and try to put an end to his life?”

She suddenly raised her voice at this point, “Benefits! Throughout these years, I’ve noticed that the entire Yang Clan only cares about benefits. If someone had value, the clan would support that person and foster that person, but if that person has no value, the clan will toss that person away like trash or even kill that person! That’s our Yang Clan!”

Meanwhile, Yang Xiao spoke in a low voice, “A clan’s resources are limited. We can only foster those who have potential.”

“No!” Yang Lianshuang suddenly said, “Fostering someone with potential to transform that person into a central pillar of our clan is something I support. However, we shouldn’t only focus on those with potential and overlook those without potential.”

She glanced at the surroundings and added, “If I become the Yang Clan’s patriarch, I’ll definitely treat everyone equally. I’ll give everyone the same number of resources. Whether you become a dragon or a worm, it’ll all depend on yourselves. Besides that, our Yang Clan will absolutely not form any unions by marriage. You’ll be free to make your own decisions on your relationships. It’s your lives, so it’ll be your choice. Furthermore, the women of our Yang Clan will be treated as equals with the men of the clan. So long as you’re capable, you can be the patriarch even if you’re female!”

Yang Ye glanced at Yang Lianshuang. Needless to say, she had her own views and opinions when leading the Yang Clan! Actually, as far as he was concerned, it was rather good for the Yang Clan to let her be the patriarch. After all, her ability, intelligence, and strength were top-rate.

If the Yang Clan had her at its helm, then even if the Yang Clan couldn’t reign supreme over the medium universe of the Milky Way System, no one would dare to bully it for the next thousand years!

Unfortunately, the Yang Clan would never let her become the patriarch!

Reform!

Yang Lianshuang wanted reform. Reform required a purge, and it meant that many people in the Yang Clan had to give up the authority they had. It was naturally Yang Xiao and the others who had to do that. However, how could they possibly be willing to give up their authority and stay behind the scenes?

Some things may not be that difficult to get, but they were difficult to give up.

After all, once they gave it up and Yang Lianshuang decided to get even with them, then they wouldn’t even have a chance to fight back!

Yang Xiao gazed at Yang Lianshuang for a long time, and then he said, “You’re not the patriarch yet, and my Yang Clan will never let a woman become the patriarch. I won’t allow it even if the clan splits apart.” He glanced at the people behind Yang Lianshuang and continued, “I’ll give all of you one final chance. You still have time to correct your mistakes now. Otherwise…”

Hiss! Hiss!

Suddenly, over a dozen more heads flew up from the group behind Yang Ye.

Yang Xiao’s face was instantly filled with a savage expression.

Yang Ye looked Yang Xiao in the eyes, “I’m not interested in hearing the nonsense you spout. I’ll ask you one last time! Will you make them come back or not?!”

Yang Xiao gazed at Yang Ye and spoke fiercely, “If you dare to kill another person, I’ll definitely make them wash Merak System with blood! You…”

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!

Meanwhile, over 30 heads flew up from the group behind Yang Ye.

All of them were cultivators below the True Realm, so they didn’t even have the chance to flee from Yang Ye!

Yang Ye gazed at Yang Xiao, “Before that happens, you’ll watch your entire family die right before your eyes!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he waved his left hand again, and then another dozen heads flew up into the air.

“Yang Ye!” Yang Xiao spoke fiercely, “If you’re a man, then stop slaughtering the weak! If you have the ability, then come at me! You…”

He seemed to have thought of something at this point, and he suddenly stopped speaking.

A wisp of ridicule curled up on the corners of Yang Ye’s mouth, “What? Not going to continue?” Yang Ye suddenly pointed his sword at Yang Xiao and continued, “Yang Xiao, you know that we men should resolve our own problems between ourselves, yet you sent your forces to kill my loved ones in Merak System. Are you even a man?”

As soon as he finished speaking, he waved his sword again. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!

Over a dozen heads flew up into the air from amidst the ground behind Yang Ye. It wasn’t that they didn’t want to flee, but there were a few True Realm experts around them. So, anyone who fled would die.

Yang Xiao’s face grew even more ferocious when he witnessed this scene. He naturally wanted to attack, but he was very well aware that with the strength Yang Ye possessed, he was utterly incapable of killing Yang Ye in an instant. Not to mention killing Yang Ye in an instant, he wasn’t even confident in his ability to defeat Yang Ye.

After all, Yang Ye still hadn’t utilized that mysterious arm of his!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye spoke fiercely, “Yang Xiao, I’ll fucking ask you one last time! Will you make them return or not?! If you refuse, I’ll kill every descendant of yours!”

At this moment, Yang Ye’s face was quite savage.

Merak System was his reverse scale. If anyone dared to touch it, he would fight that person to the death! Just as he’d said, he had no intention to act against Yang Xiao’s family, but he had no other choice now. Even if he charged out of Heaven Void Continent now, he wasn’t able to make it back to Merak System in time.

Now, he could only force Yang Xiao to make those experts return!

The surroundings suddenly fell silent.

Everyone gazed at Yang Xiao.

There were two paths laid out before Yang Xiao. Compromise or don’t compromise.

If he made a compromise, it meant that from today onwards, Merak System will cease to be a trump card they could use against Yang Ye; if he decided against making a compromise, then it represented that he would be using the lives of his entire family in exchange for Merak System!

To exchange or not to exchange?

Yang Xiao remained silent for a few moments, and then he suddenly looked up at the sky and said, “Ying Clan! Ku Clan! I agree to your conditions!”

“I hope we have a pleasant cooperation!” Suddenly, loud laughter resounded in the sky, and then over 20 old men appeared there.

The Ku Clan and Ying Clan!

At this moment, Yang Lianshuang and Yang Ye’s faces fell.

Obviously, they hadn’t expected the Ku Clan and Yang Clan to participate in this!
