Chapter 1499 - Little Little Sky! Get Help!

Translator: InVader

Yang Ye was stunned as well. He hadn’t expected Little Sky to provoke Blood Maiden. Little Sky usually had a very good temper, but she clearly seemed to be angry right now.

Blood Maiden gazed at Little Sky and remained silent.

Meanwhile, Little Sky walked over to Blood Maiden and looked her in the eyes, “You think that you’re very strong?”

Blood Maiden refused to show any weakness, “I think I’m not bad!”

Little Sky gazed at Blood Maiden for a short while, and then she nodded, “Since you think you’re very strong, then let me see how strong you are.”

As soon as she finished speaking, she looked up at Little Little Sky, “Little Little Sky! Get help!”

Get help!

Everyone here was stunned when they heard this.

The Eye of the Heaven Dao has help?

Suddenly, the Eye of the Heaven Dao in the sky trembled violently, and then the space beside it cracked open. It didn’t take long for an eye to emerge from that rift in space!

An Eye of the Heaven Dao!

An Eye of the Heaven Dao that was around the same size as Little Little Sky emerged from that rift in space. However, that wasn’t the end of it. More and more Eyes of the Heaven Dao emerged from that spatial rift. In just a little over a dozen breaths of time, the sky was filled with over 100 Eyes of the Heaven Dao. At this moment, the entire sky was covered in them!

Wave after wave of pressure swept out from them. How terrifying was the pressure emanated from over 100 Eyes of the Heaven Dao?

In any case, even Dualism Realm experts weren’t able to endure the pressure. Besides Blood Maiden, the bodies of everyone else here had gradually bent down, including the old man with a hunched back. However, he was in a comparatively better condition when compared to Lian Banzhuang and the others. He wasn’t in such an embarrassing state. As for Yang Ye, he’d raised the casket lid above himself, so he was in a slightly better condition than Lian Banzhuang and the others!

At this moment, the expressions of everyone here had changed.

Their faces were unsightly!

Over 100 Eyes of the Heaven Dao!

If all of the Eyes of the Heaven Dao attacked at once, then not to mention destroying the Ominous Territory, it was even possible for them to destroy the entire lower dimensions! These Eyes of the Heaven Dao were weaker than the Eye of the Heaven Dao in the large world. However, they were definitely much stronger than the Eyes of the Heaven Dao in medium sized worlds. So, not to mention a single Rebirth Realm expert, even 10 Rebirth Realm experts may not necessarily be able to resist them!

Blood Maiden’s eyes instantly narrowed slightly when she saw over 100 Eyes of the Heaven Dao. Obviously, she hadn’t expected such a scene as well/

Little Sky glanced at Lian Banzhuang and the others, “Defy the heavens? You humans always speak about defying the heavens, but all of you don’t know how tiny you are. When the heavens really decide to take all of you seriously, can you afford to go against the heavens? You can’t!” She gazed at Blood Maiden and continued, “Are around 100 enough? If you think they aren’t enough, Little Little Sky can call another 100 over. This universe has thousands of medium worlds and numerous hidden worlds. Little Little Sky can summon all the Eyes of the Heaven Dao in those worlds!”

Blood Maiden looked at Little Sky, “Who are you?!”

Everyone else was looking at Little Sky. At this moment, all of them were extremely curious about Little Sky’s identity. Earlier, Little Little Sky hadn’t summoned help, but as soon as she showed herself, she’d immediately told Little Little Sky to get help. Even though it was because of Little Little Sky, all of them were aware that Little Sky was definitely a huge reason why Little Little Sky had been able to summon all of these Eyes of the Heaven Dao!

Yang Ye didn’t let Little Sky and Blood Maiden remain in confrontation. He walked over to Little Sky and said, “We have no intention to kill Little Little Sky, and we just want to leave. That’s why second sister suppressed it, but we never expected it to be so unyielding and choose to detonate itself!”

Little Sky replied, “Its mission is to guard these people. If you take them out of here by force, then it’ll definitely detonate itself!”

Yang Ye said, “Then can you tell it not to detonate itself, and then let us leave?” If it was anyone else, it would definitely be impossible, but he was talking to Little Sky. If she was willing to help, then it would definitely be possible. Because Little Sky had a very good relationship with Little Little Sky. Little Little Sky would definitely not give them face, but it would give Little Sky face!

Little Sky glanced at Lian Banzhuang and the others, and then she said, “Do you know why they were imprisoned here?”

Yang Ye nodded, “They are invaders.”

Little Sky shook her head, “They killed countless people and Eyes of the Heaven Dao in our universe for their own personal gain. They should be dead.”

Meanwhile, the old man with a hunched back spoke abruptly, “We know that we were wrong, but we’ve paid the price for our actions. We can swear with our souls that we’ll leave this universe once we leave this place, and we will absolutely not take another step into this universe again. Please give us a chance to change!”

At this moment, he was very well aware that the only chance for them to leave this place wasn’t Blood Maiden but Little Sky!

Yang Ye added, “Little Sky, they’ve been imprisoned for very, very long. If it’s possible, just let them out. You told me that both humans and demon beasts should be free. But they aren’t free at all. Right?”

Little Sky remained silent.

Yang Ye continued, “If the Lord of the Heaven Dao wanted to kill them, they would have definitely been killed on the spot. But they were imprisoned instead. I think that the Lord of the Heaven Dao wanted to give them a chance to change their ways. What do you think?”

A long moment of silence passed before Little Sky suddenly glanced at the surroundings, “This place really shouldn’t exist anymore.”

Lian Banzhuang and the others were delighted when they heard her. Because now that she’d said that, it wouldn’t be a problem for them to leave.

Meanwhile, Little Sky added, “But there’s a condition!”

Yang Ye hurriedly asked, “What condition?”

Little Sky glanced at Lian Banzhuang and the others, and then she said, “Many have realized their mistakes, and these people can be let out of this place. However, many others might not think they’d made any mistakes, and they may even be filled with resentment. These people can’t be allowed to leave.”

“Of course!” Yang Ye continued, “But how do we know if they are determined to change their ways?”

“I will know!” Little Sky continued, “No one can deceive me.” As soon as she finished speaking, she glanced at Lian Banzhuang and the others, “All of you have no resentment in your hearts. This proves that all of you are very well aware that you deserved such punishment, and it proves that you regret your actions. So, all of you can leave.”

Lian Banzhuang and the others were overjoyed when they heard Little Sky. However, Demon Wu suddenly asked, “Can you make decisions for the Lord of the Heaven Dao?”

The smiles on their faces gradually vanished when they heard Demon Wu, and then they gazed at Little Sky. All of them were very well aware that Little Sky’s identity and background was definitely extraordinary. Because she had such a good relationship with an Eye of the Heaven Dao. However, that was just a good relationship, and letting them go was not a minor matter. Perhaps even that Eye of the Heaven Dao, Little Little Sky, didn’t have the right to authorize it!

So, did Little Sky have such authority?

Little Sky replied, “I don’t know if I can!”

All of them felt speechless.

Meanwhile, Little Sky added, “But I can give it a try. Little Little Sky and the others are quite nice!”

Yang Ye and the others’ faces darkened. Nice? The Eyes of the Heaven Dao are nice? Please! They wouldn’t even allow us to converse with them.

However, the Eyes of the Heaven Dao really were nice to Little Sky!

Little Sky flashed over to Little Little Sky, and then she waved her hand at the other Eyes of the Heaven Dao around Little Little Sky. Those Eyes of the Heaven Dao seemed to recognize her too, and they started moving up and down as well to greet her. Moreover, some Eyes of the Heaven Dao seemed jubilant!

Little Sky chuckled, gazed at Little Little Sky, and spoke in a slightly reproachful tone, “You fool! If you’re no match for someone, then can’t you get help? You just have to detonate yourself? You’re such a fool!”

Little Little Sky trembled slightly, and then ripples flowed from it. Obviously, it was expressing something to her. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Little Sky sighed softly, and then she gazed at the Eyes of the Heaven Dao in the surroundings, “All of you listen too. In the future, if you aren’t a match for someone or something, then you can get help. Get help! Understand? Moreover, all of you should help each other. Don’t let those fellows constantly speak about defying the heavens. Understand?”

Yang Ye and the others watched with astonishment as those Eyes of the Heaven Dao nodded!

Needless to say, Yang Ye’s face was quite unsightly. Because he always got into conflict with the Eyes of the Heaven Dao. If he got into conflict with one in the future, and if it got help…

No one knew what Little Sky told those Eyes of the Heaven Dao, but they vanished from the sky, and only Little Little Sky remained.

Blood Maiden suddenly asked Yang Ye, “How did you get to know her?”

Yang Ye naturally knew who Blood Maiden was referring to. He glanced at Little Sky who was talking to Little Little Sky, and then he said, “It was in the Ominous Territory. She was lying in an ice casket…” He described the entire sequence of events that led up to their meeting.

Blood Maiden remained silent.

Yang Ye asked, “Do you know who she is?”

Blood Maiden shook her head slightly, “I’ve never heard of her!”

Yang Ye looked up at Little Sky. Who is she? Even Blood Maiden hasn’t heard of her?

Yang Ye grew even more curious about Little Sky’s identity.

She was really too mysterious!
