Chapter 2144 – The Dao Progenitor!

Yang Ye looked up, and he saw an old man there.

The old man wore a Daoist’s robe, held a horsetail whisk, and had a grin on his face. Besides that, he emanated a transcendent aura.

It was none other than the Dao Progenitor!

The old man in Daoist’s robes!

Yang Ye calmed down when he saw the old man, and then he walked over and bowed respectfully. It was a sincere bow.

The Dao Progenitor gazed at Yang Ye and grinned, “You’ve grown fast.”

Yang Ye asked, “Senior, you’re here for a reason, right?”

The Dao Progenitor replied, “Indeed!”

Yang Ye smiled, “You’re not here to tell me to return to the Dao Path, right?”

The old man shook his head slightly, “I’ve never had that intention!”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Huh?”

The Dao Progenitor explained, “Your character is one that seeks freedom and being unrestrained. No organization is able to tie you down. Simply speaking, you like to break the rules and break convention, but my Dao Path needs rules to restrain its members. There’ll be conflict if you come to the Dao Path. Moreover, I don’t want to change your character. The reason the king of wolves is powerful is because it grew up freely deep within the mountain. If it’s a wolf raised at home, it will never be able to become a king of wolves!”

Yang Ye fell silent.

The old man continued, “You’re the person I chose, but it doesn’t represent that you must join the Dao Path.”

Yang Ye spoke solemnly, “Senior, what’s actually happening to the large universe?”

The Dao Progenitor smiled, “Actually, it’s the End Times.”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “The End Times? What does that mean?”

The Dao Progenitor said, “The End Times is when the spirit energy in the large universe dries up and countless living beings perish. All those years ago, the prehistoric race experienced the End Times. So, their entire race vanished. They were quite strong because even if they experienced the End Times, they were still able to keep some of their people alive.”

Yang Ye asked, “Why does the End Times exist?”

The Dao Progenitor smiled, “People age, fall ill, and die; the world has four seasons… They are all laws of nature. Only with death will there be new life. It’s the final law of the universe, and no one can change it.”

Yang Ye said, “So, the large universe is going to be destroyed?”

The Dao Progenitor shook his head, “Not the large universe, just its living beings. Besides some special living beings, all others will die. That’s the problem all three paths face right now, and it’s also why the god race dared to show itself. They know that we wouldn’t dare to target them at a time like this. Actually, my Dao Path wouldn’t target them even if the End Times weren’t arriving.”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Why?”

The Dao Progenitor pondered deeply and said, “I was born in Milky Way System, a small world. I cultivated all the way from then until now, and my Dao Path was a path I explored all the way from there until the medium universe, and then to this large universe. We’ve always been exploring, exploring new worlds, new life, new universes, and new futures.”

He waved his hand, and then Yang Ye and him instantly appeared in the starry sky.

There were rows of stars extremely far away from Yang Ye, and they were moving slowly. If one looked carefully, one would notice that they were moving in an extremely orderly manner.

The Dao Progenitor suddenly asked, “How was all of this formed?”

Yang Ye gazed at the Dao Progenitor, and the latter smiled, “Did they appear out of thin air? Obviously, that’s impossible. Were they man-made? That is possible, but who possesses such great ability to create the boundless universe and then make it go on in an orderly manner?”

He looked up into the depths of space at this point, and he continued, “I have the ability to destroy this all, but I cannot create it. Creation is an aspect that all of us old fellows in this universe must overcome.”

Yang Ye suddenly said, “Someone once said the same thing to me!”

It was naturally Elder Mo from the weapon path.

The Dao Progenitor gazed at Yang Ye, “Then he should be extraordinary.” He walked over to Yang Ye and continued, “Actually, I’ve always believed the Dao is nature, and most things are predetermined by the heavens. For example, my pagoda fell into your hands. Actually, I told you before, it hadn’t chosen you. However, someone forcefully sent it into you and dragged me into it just to give you a new destiny…”

He shook his head and smiled, “I had the ability to refuse it, but I didn’t.”

Yang Ye smiled, “I’ve always thought that I’m very normal, and I’m just an ordinary person. But now it seems like I’m not!”

The Dao Progenitor replied, “You’re quite complicated indeed. However, all of that isn’t important, what’s important is that you stay true to your heart. If you can do that, you’ll remain who you are. Otherwise, you may become someone else.”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Huh?”

The Dao Progenitor smiled, “I’ve said a little too much. There are many things that will bring you no good if you find out about it now. I came here to see you because I need your help with something.”

Yang Ye replied, “Senior, please go ahead!”

The Dao Progenitor said, “The endless black holes. Our large universe must create a path through it. But do you know what is required to do so? Every black hole must be suppressed by a progenitor. Because there is a mysterious restriction within it, every black hole has one. So, in order to open a path through it, a progenitor must suppress the restrictions. So, I’m fully occupied with that, and only two in my Dao Path have the strength to enter those black holes. However, one of them is dead, and one more has gone missing!”

Yang Ye asked, “You want me to go in there?”

The Dao Progenitor nodded, “Of course, I won’t make you go for nothing. I’ll help you suppress two black holes. One of them is for my Dao Path, and the other is yours. At that time, you can take the human race with you, or just take your loved ones with you. Of course, all of this is only valid in the future, and whether those two black holes have a path that leads out of this universe is still an uncertainty!”

Yang Ye asked, “What if both of them don’t have a path?”

The Dao Progenitor replied, “Then we can only explore a different black hole. If all of them don’t have a path, then we can do nothing else. At that time, we can only wait for the End Times to arrive, and then fight it.”

Let the heavens decide their fate!

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and said, “Has the Alliance of All gone there too?”

The old man replied, “They have. However, they don’t have a progenitor to suppress it, so it’s very difficult for them to explore a black hole. Presently, all the organizations in the large universe are looking for a way out, even the god race. However, the prehistoric race…”

He shook his head at this point, “I’ve come into contact with them, and I don’t know what their true objective is.”

Yang Ye nodded, “Alright, I’ll do it.”

The Dao Progenitor grinned, “Besides that, take good care of your Sprite Lord. According to my knowledge, the Buddhist Path and Weapon Path are targeting it too. Because if they have no other way out of the large universe, she is everyone’s last hope.”

Yang Ye joked, “What about the Dao Path?”

The old man grinned, “Would you refuse if I asked for your help?”

Yang Ye smiled and didn’t answer the question.

He owed the Dao Progenitor. Thus, so long as Snowy would remain unharmed, he would naturally not refuse. As for the other paths, it was none of his business.

The Dao Progenitor said, “Get ready and come look for me in the Dao Path.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he waved his hand, and the surroundings returned to normal.

Outside the hall, Lin Zhen and Yang Lianshuang returned to normal. Lin Zhen glanced at the surroundings and glanced at Yang Ye, “An ancestor?” Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Yang Ye nodded.

Lin Zhen wanted to say something, but he hesitated for a moment and didn’t say anything in the end. He glanced at Yang Lianshuang and asked, “Who’s this?”

Yang Ye smiled, “A friend of mine. She’ll be helping me here from now on. I hope you’ll take good care of her.”

Lin Zhen was a smart person, so he naturally understood what Yang Ye meant. He nodded and smiled, “Of course!”

He turned around and left once he finished speaking.

Yang Lianshuang asked, “The Dao Path?”

Yang Ye nodded.

Yang Lianshuang asked another question, “Was it about the endless black holes?”

Yang Ye gazed at her, “Congratulations, you’ve guessed correctly again!”

Yang Lianshuang said, “Actually, I knew this would happen. The Dao Path would definitely want you to go. Because practically no Sage below the Progenitor Realm can defeat you, and you have An Nanjing by your side too. It can be said that so long as she doesn’t leave your side and no progenitors step forward, no one can harm you. So, you’re the best choice for the Dao Path!”

Yang Ye spoke solemnly, “Presently, the three paths, the god race, and even the Alliance of All are searching for a way out for themselves, and they aren’t choosing to fight the End Times. Obviously, it’s very difficult to resist. So, we must prepare a way out for ourselves and the human race too.”

Yang Lianshuang suddenly asked, “You probably wouldn’t fear anything if you were alone, right?”

“Alone?” Yang Ye chuckled, “If I were alone…”

He didn’t continue.

Obviously, he would have no worries, but it wasn’t something he wanted. Presently, he had loved ones, wives, a daughter, Snowy, and his friends.

He didn’t want to abandon any of them.

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts and gazed at Yang Lianshuang, “With Lin Zhen’s help, you should be able to take a hold of authority here very soon. However, you must continue showing respect to those Sages. They are Sages, after all.”

She rolled her eyes at him, “Do you think I’m stupid?”

Yang Ye smiled, chatted with her for a while, and then left Nature Sacred Grounds.

As soon as he left the Human Dimension, he was obstructed by three middle aged men.

One of them shouted angrily, “The Sovereign of Sky has ordered that no one is allowed to leave the Human Dimension. Those who disobey will be killed without exception!”

Hiss!

As soon as he finished speaking, his head flew up into the air.

The other two middle aged men were stunned on the spot.

Yang Ye gazed at them, “Go back and tell the Sovereign of Sky that I, Yang Ye, have ordered him to know his place. Otherwise, I’ll let him experience how it feels to have his head separated from his neck.”
