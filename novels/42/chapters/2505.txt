Chapter 2506 – Come Down Here!

Time passed quickly, and two days passed in the blink of an eye.

At dawn on the third day, Xing Biqing arrived as agreed upon.

Yang Ye walked out of the room, went downstairs, and she walked over to him, “Let’s go!”

Yang Ye nodded, and they left the House of Indulgence.

Yang Ye followed her out of the city, and then he saw a carriage there. However, it was no ordinary carriage because it wasn’t being pulled by horses, it was a huge demon beast that was the size of a hill, and it was pulling a very luxurious mini-palace.

Yang Ye asked, “What’s that?”

She explained, “It’s here to get us there. It’s quite far, so we must conserve our strength.”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and nodded.

Once they entered the palace, the demon beast leaped up and appeared over 1km away.

It was like a bolt of lightning!

The palace had a huge expanse of space within it, and there was a tea table there.

They sat facing each other, and there was another woman here, Emerald.

Yang Ye glanced at Emerald, “Miss Emerald, you’re going too?”

Emerald nodded slightly.

Xing Biqing said, “Brother Ye, what do you think about her?”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and said, “Neither humble nor arrogant, and an extraordinary bearing. She’s not bad indeed.”

Xing Biqing smiled, “She’s from a branch family in my clan!”

Yang Ye glanced at Xing Biqing and said, “Miss Xing, there’s something I’ve been wondering about. All of you large clans are divided into the main family and branch families. Why? Aren’t all of you from the same family?”

Xing Biqing took a sip of tea and said, “Young Master Yang, let me give you an example. An emperor in the mortal world has 10 sons, but only one can become the next emperor. Once he becomes the next emperor, what would happen to the others? Of course, if you think of it positively, the others will just be pushed out from the circle of authority. After a few generations, their descendants would be even further apart from the emperor’s line. Not to mention feelings, even the blood between them would be much thinner.”

Yang Ye started to understand when she explained it like that. It was like two brothers who were close to each other. Their next generation would be cousins, and they would be very close too. But what about the generations after that?

That was how the branches were created!

In theory, they were still part of the Xing Clan, but their ties to the main family was very thin. Because countless generations had passed. Perhaps there was only no distinction in the family when it was the time of those two brothers in the beginning.

Meanwhile, Xing Biqing suddenly said, “Of course, in order to make the clan have even more geniuses, we do select extremely talented individuals from the branch families. Anyone outstanding will be recruited and fostered by the main family.”

Yang Ye smiled, “But their status is still inferior to the main family, right?”

Xing Biqing shook her head and gazed at Emerald, “If Emerald’s strength surpasses mine, or her talent surpasses mine, then the clan will treat her just as it treats me. Of course, trying to accomplish that from a branch family is much, much more difficult than from within the main family.”

She took another drink of her tea and continued, “I’ve inquired about the Ye Clan. Their branch families are very chaotic. Because the main family completely disregards them. So long as they don’t do anything that goes too far, the main family will not interfere. As for their internal affairs, the main family isn’t interested in it at all. However…”

Yang Ye smiled, “What?”

Xing Biqing chuckled, “Your next patriarch, Ye Zhibei, is an amazing person. She has started to manage those branch families.”

Yang Ye smiled, “Xing Biqing, is it possible for me to become the Ye Clan’s patriarch?”

Xing Biqing’s eyes narrowed slightly. She gazed at Yang Ye for a long time and said, “Are you serious?”

Yang Ye smiled, “I’m just asking.”

Xing Biqing fell silent for a short while and said, “It’s difficult, very difficult!”

Yang Ye chuckled, “Why?”

She replied, “Because you’re not a core member of the main family. The main clan will practically never give up their authority to someone from a branch family. Moreover, an illegitimate child too.”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and said, “What if I can crush Ye Zhibei and the Ye Clan’s entire younger generation?”

Xing Biqing’s hand trembled slightly, and then she gazed at Yang Ye in silence.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye chuckled, “I’m joking. Even if the Ye Clan asks me to be its patriarch, I wouldn’t. I’m a member of the Ancient Sword Sect!”

Xing Biqing spoke softly, “Young Master Ye, I can’t see through you!”

Yang Ye smiled and remained silent.

Xing Biqing spoke abruptly, “Can I ask if you have the desire to take revenge on the Ye Clan?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “No!”

She gazed at him and remained silent.

Yang Ye smiled, “It’s the truth. There’s nothing between us anymore. Moreover, even if there’s enmity, it’s with the branch family, not the main family. So, what do you think?”

She nodded slightly, “That’s good!”

Yang Ye glanced at her and smiled, “Why do you say that?”

She replied, “To be honest, I’m on quite good terms with Ye Zhibei. We joined the War Dimension together, and we experienced many things together. She’s a good person, and a capable one too. If you are able to return to the Ye Clan and help her, then the Ye Clan’s future will definitely be extraordinary.”

Yang Ye grinned, “Isn’t your Xing Clan afraid of that?”

She shook her head, “The Eternal Kingdom’s greatest enemy right now is the desolate race.”

The desolate race!

All the clans of Eternal Kingdom would stay united while facing the desolate race!

Yang Ye fell silent. After a long period of silence, he had a conclusion. He had to work hard on improving his strength!

It didn’t matter how the Eternal Kingdom and desolate race were fighting, his own strength was most important!

Meanwhile, Emerald suddenly said, “We’re here!”

Yang Ye and Xing Biqing stood up and left the palace. At this moment, they were on a plain, and mist drifted at the end of their fields of vision. The mist enveloped the area ahead, and it was impossible to see through.

Suddenly, Xing Biqing looked to the side, and a white horse was dashing over. There was a woman on it, and she had half a cucumber in her grasp!

Ye Zhibei!

Yang Ye had met her in the past, it had been by the city walls.

Yang Ye gazed at Xing Biqing, “You invited others?”

Xing Biqing shook her head, “No. However, quite a few people have come here today. Because it’s the only day that entrance into that place is possible.”

Yang Ye nodded and didn’t say anything else.

Meanwhile, Ye Zhibei had arrived before them. She leaped off her horse and patted it lightly. The latter immediately transformed into a ray of white light that vanished into the distance.

Ye Zhibei glanced at Yang Ye, gazed at Xing Biqing, and nodded.

Xing Biqing said, “They should be here!”

Ye Zhibei replied, “They’ve gone inside.”

They’ve gone inside!

Xing Biqing’s eyes narrowed slightly, and then she glanced at the world of mist, “Let’s go too!”

As she spoke, she gazed at Emerald and flicked four World Crystals to her, “Attain the Four World Realm and the clan will send someone to get you!”

Emerald glanced at the World Crystals and spoke softly, “T-Thank you!”

Xing Biqing nodded, and then she vanished into the distance with Yang Ye and Ye Zhibei.

They entered the mist. It was quite mysterious because their divine sense couldn’t spread out within it, and their field of vision was extremely limited.

Yang Ye asked, “What is this place?” At the same time, he became quite vigilant.

This entire place seemed strange, so he had to be careful!

Xing Biqing replied, “Ruins of an ancient battlefield!”

Ruins of an ancient battlefield!

Yang Ye frowned slightly, “Is it an actual ruin from the ancient times?”

Xing Biqing nodded, “There are very few records about that era. At present, this is the only known ruin from that time.”

Yang Ye asked, “Did the higher-ups of Eternal Kingdom not send anyone to investigate it?”

Xing Biqing shook her head, “There are powerful restrictions around this place. Experts at the Lord Realm and above will cause the restrictions to react strongly to their presence. While they can destroy the restrictions and break open this place, they are afraid of destroying this place in the process. So, the area is merely sealed off for now, and then we juniors are allowed to try our luck in here and see if we can find anything! Up until now, it’s World Crystals that have been discovered the most. We get around 100 World Crystals on every trip!”

100!

It was a lot!

Yang Ye’s desire was suddenly aroused!

Now, he’d noticed that World Crystals were treasures, and they could be exchanged for many, many things.

Xing Biqing glanced at Yang Ye and smiled, “Brother Yang, do you need World Crystals?”

Yang Ye nodded, “My body isn’t strong enough, so I need resources!”

She hesitated for a moment and asked, “Why are you on the path of body cultivation? I’m not trying to speak ill of body cultivation. Conversely, I admire body cultivators. Especially someone like you who has achieved such a level in the body. I truly admire it!”

Body cultivation!

Yang Ye smiled, “In the beginning, cultivation of the body required the least amount of resources. It only required the ability to endure suffering. But as I progressed, I realized that cultivating the body requires huge amounts of resources too. Moreover, I think the body is a person’s foundation, so improving it is extremely beneficial.”

Xing Biqing spoke softly, “Compared to your body, it’s your sword that’s quite terrifying.”

Yang Ye smiled, “You’re both around my age, yet you’re at the Five World Realm. Moreover, your cultivations are strong and stable. You’re both much better than me.”

Xing Biqing glanced at Yang Ye and didn’t say anything.

Meanwhile, they stopped. It was because an abyss had appeared before them. There was white mist and black energy within the abyss, and there was a gloomy aura throughout it.

Yang Ye gazed at the abyss for a short while, and then he suddenly walked over to its edge and listened carefully. It sounded like something was shouting and howling from the bottom!

“Come down here!”

That was what he heard.T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m
