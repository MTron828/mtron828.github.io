Chapter 792 – Converging To Kill Yang Ye!

Translator: InVader

Editor: Conspiracing

The eighth rank of the Monarch Rank!

Yang Ye was quite stunned by this advancement. He really hadn’t imagined that the Saint Spirit Fruit would actually be so terrifying. After all, he’d only just consumed it, yet the energy which erupted from it had instantly allowed him to advance to the eighth rank of the Monarch Realm! After a moment of shock, he was overjoyed. Because he noticed that he’d suddenly gained a huge amount of Primordial Violet Energy after the advancement!

Yang Ye had a feeling that it was the Primordial Pagoda’s way of urging him to cultivate!

It gave a little Primordial Violet Energy to him after every advancement! This made him have no choice but to do all he could to improve his strength. Because the Primordial Violet Energy could save his life!

Yang Ye focused his mind, discarded the distracting thoughts within it, and started concentrating on cultivating.

...

Outside the Ancient City of Hallows.

Supreme Exalt He and Mu stood before the gates while 50 white robed old men stood by each of their sides. Every single white robed old man was a mid-grade Half-Saint!

Supreme Exalt He gazed at the 100 white robed old men and said, “I’m very well aware of the strength that all of you possess. Even I and Brother Mu aren’t a march for all of you if you join forces. However, what I’m trying to say is that you must not be careless when you encounter Yang Ye, and you must not act on your own. Even though he’s only a Monarch Realm profounder, his strength is sufficient to kill Half-Saints. Coupled with the Stone of Suppression and the Half-Saint puppets he possesses, even a mid-grade Half-Saint is no match for him!”

He paused for a moment when he spoke up to this point, “He has repeatedly acted against our Hallowed Grounds, and he even caused us to suffer heavy losses. Not only would we be unable to rest in peace while he’s still alive, the Hallowed Grounds would live eternally in shame until he’s eliminated!”

“His concealment technique is extremely formidable. We can’t do anything to him if he stays hidden!” One of the old men spoke solemnly.

Supreme Exalt He waved his right hand, and then 5 talismans appeared in the hands of every single white robed old man. He said, “These are Divinelight Talismans that were crafted by Grandmaster Shen Mo. So long as he shows himself, you just have to tear this talisman apart and he wouldn’t be able to conceal himself within an area of 500km.”

“That makes things easier!” That old man nodded.

Supreme Exalt He glanced at them and said, “One last reminder. Don’t underestimate him when you do find him, and don’t act rashly. You must notify us at the first possible moment!”

“Understood!” They voiced their agreement before transforming into rays of light that vanished into the sky.

Supreme Exalt He withdrew his gaze, and there was a trace of ferocity in his eyes, “Yang Ye, you’ll die a graveless death this time!”

...

On a mountain range that was located thousands of kilometers away from the Ancient City of Hallows, a voice suddenly resounded, “The person who kills Yang Ye will be rewarded with a Life Essence Pill!” Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“I’ll be taking that pill!” A figure shot into the sky and vanished into the horizon. Moreover, many other figures flew off behind him!

...

Nameless City.

There were only 3 people in a hall. The blind old man, Shen Mo, and the headless person.

“That fellow, Yang Ye, almost made the defiant profounders and the Hallowed Grounds suffer heavy losses. If it was in the past, I would naturally be happy to see something like that happen. Yet now.... In short, if he isn’t eliminated, then he might spoil our plans!” The blind old man spoke solemnly.

“The defiant profounders and the Hallowed Grounds have acted, so why should we interfere?” said the headless person.

The blind old man replied, “But don’t forget that Yang Ye has the Stone of Suppression. It isn’t a huge threat to us while it’s in Yang Ye’s hands, but if it falls into the hands of the Hallowed Grounds or defiant profounders, then we might fall under the control of others.”

The headless man and Shen Mo fell silent.

The blind old man continued, “So, the Stone of Suppression absolutely can’t be allowed to fall into their hands. What do all of you think?”

“You intend to kill Yang Ye?” asked the headless person.

“I just want the Stone of Suppression!” The old man said, “Of course, I’ll have no choice but to seize it if he refuses to give it to me. So, whether he’ll be able to live is up to him!”

As he spoke, the blind old man vanished from within the hall.

The headless person asked, “What do you think about all of that?”

“No one can stop the Hallowed Grounds and defiant profounders from completing their plan!” said Shen Mo.

The headless person stood up and walked towards the exit, “The members of the Hallowed Grounds are almost completely annihilated. It’s time to deal with the people in this city....”

...

At this moment, Yang Ye naturally didn’t know that his actions in the Ancient City of Hallows had made these forces start to dispatch their experts to pursue and kill him.

Yang Ye’s aura was growing stronger and stronger as he sat on the huge rock. The energy that erupted from the Saint Spirit Fruit was surging through his body like a tsunami, and he was ceaselessly absorbing that energy.

Just like that, 3 days passed.

Bang!

An extremely terrifying aura surged out from within Yang Ye, and that aura swept out in all directions. In an instant, everything in an area of 50km around Yang Ye was destroyed.

The ninth rank of the Monarch Realm!

At this moment, Yang Ye had attained the ninth rank of the Monarch Realm, and the aura within him was ceaselessly growing stronger!

The Sword Spirit and Ding Shaoyao appeared by Yang Ye’s side.

“Is he trying to charge into the Half-Saint Realm?” asked Ding Shaoyao in a heavy voice, and her voice carried a trace of pleasant surprise. After all, if Yang Ye attained the Half-Saint Realm, then even the supreme exalts of the Hallowed Grounds could dream of killing him.

A wisp of worry flashed through the Sword Spirit’s eyes as she said, “Even though his foundation isn’t bad, he’s still too young. If he forcefully attains the Half-Saint Realm within experiencing consolidation of his gains through time and attaining various comprehensions, then while it would be enormously beneficial to him in the short run, it will plant a seed of disaster within him. Or I should say that it would bury many seeds of disaster within him. Because his cultivation has truly been rising too quickly.”

The happiness in Ding Shaoyao’s eyes vanished when she heard this, and she said, “Is it very

serious?”

The Sword Spirit replied, “Do you know why Nether Maiden is still at the Exalt Realm? Even the Half-Saint Realm wouldn’t be impossible with the natural talent she possesses. However, she’s still at the Exalt Realm because she suppressed the speed of her advancement. She wants to attain the Monarch Realm naturally, and then finally attain the Half-Saint Realm. In that way, her future would be limitless, and it would make her foundation extremely solid!”

“Should we stop him?” asked Ding Shaoyao.

The Sword Spirit shook her head in response, “He’ll figure it out. Moreover, unless he’s assisted by treasures, it’s impossible for him to attain the Half-Saint Realm now!”

Ding Shaoyao nodded lightly, and then she gazed at Yang Ye. Her gaze carried a trace of worry.

Yang Ye’s aura was still rising steadily. However, it didn’t take long for his aura to gradually stabilize. The Sword Spirit nodded when she saw this and said, “He’s still considerable composed and didn’t try to charge into the Half-Saint Realm.”

Meanwhile, the Sword Spirit’s expression suddenly changed. She looked up into the sky and said, “Shit! The commotion he created was too huge. Someone noticed us1”

As soon as she finished speaking, she immediately formed a seal, and then 3 circular sword formations appeared beneath their feet. After that, they immediately vanished on the spot.

Less than 2 breaths after they vanished, Supreme Exalt He, Supreme Exalt Mu, and 100 white robed old men appeared where they were just moments ago, and their expressions turned gloomy when they noticed that it was completely empty.

“Search! He couldn’t have gone fat!” As soon as Supreme Exalt He finished speaking, all of them immediately tore space open and vanished on the spot.

After executing 3 Five Element Sword Flights in succession, the Sword Spirit finally stopped fleeing.

“The Hallowed Grounds dispatched a huge number of experts. Besides the 2 supreme exalts, there were around 100 mid-grade Half-Saints as well. Moreover, I even sensed an extremely obscure aura. That....”

Suddenly, her eyes opened wide, and then she looked up into the sky. The space there was torn open, and then a spear shot down towards the 3 of them! The spear was extremely swift, and coupled with the fact that it had caught them off guard, it was utterly impossible for the Sword Spirit to execute the Five Element Sword Flight technique!

At this moment, Yang Ye was still seated cross-legged on the ground with his eyes tightly closed. He seemed to be absorbing the remaining energy within him, so only the Sword Spirit could do something now.

As she gazed at the spear that was about to reach them, a cold glow flashed through her eyes. She tapped her right foot on the ground, and then she transformed into an enormous sword that shot into the sky and collided with the spear.

Bang!

A huge explosion resounded in the sky. After that, the Sword Spirit descended to the ground by Yang Ye and Ding Shaoyao’s side. At this moment, her countenance was ghastly pale, and her eyes were filled with terror.

Ding Shaoyao frowned. She was about to say something when the Sword Spirit had immediately formed a seal, and then all 3 of them vanished on the spot.

At the very same instant that they vanished, a black robed man who held a spear appeared where they were just a moment ago.

“No one can escape me, Chi Jing, if I want to kill them!” The black robed man took a step forward, and then he vanished on the spot.

Right after he vanished, the blind old man instantly appeared where he stood just now. At the same time, Supreme Exalt He’s group appeared here as well.

A wisp of surprise flashed through Supreme Exalt He’s eyes when he saw the blind old man, and then he seemed to have thought of something, and he merely took a deep and long glance at the blind old man yet didn’t speak a word.

“Who was that? He’s truly strong!” The blind old man spoke abruptly.

“A defiant profounder!” Supreme Exalt He replied, “He should be one of the 10 divine generals. I just don’t know what his ranking is. Hmph! No matter what his ranking is, he’s more than enough to kill Yang Ye!”

The blind old man shook his head and said, “So many of us have actually set out just to pursue and kill a Monarch Realm profounder....”

Supreme Exalt He’s face was quite unsightly. After all, it truly was a humiliation for so many to be pursuing a Monarch Realm profounder.

Supreme Exalt Mu suddenly said, “Don’t waste any more time. If we’re too late, then Yang Ye might fall into the hands of the defiant profounders!”

Supreme Exalt He nodded in response, and then all of them tore space apart and left.

The blind old man hurriedly followed them.

The Sword Spirit, Yang Ye, and Ding Shaoyao’s feet had just touched the ground when Ding Shaoyao spoke with shock, “Sword Spirit! You....” Because the Sword Spirit’s face wasn’t just pale, her body was actually starting to become slightly translucent!

“Flee! Why aren’t you fleeing anymore? I haven’t had enough fun!” Meanwhile, the black robed man appeared not too far behind them.

“It’s fine. I’ll play with you instead!” Yang Ye’s voice suddenly resounded!
