Chapter 2045 – It’s Mine Now!

The Prediction Line? Yang Ye frowned slightly, “What? They’re finally taking action?”

Elder Yuan nodded slightly, “I’m really surprised that they were able to wait for so long!”

Yang Ye glanced at the invitation, “Leave it! I’ll go when I’m free!”

Elder Yuan was slightly stunned and asked, “You’re not going immediately?”

Yang Ye shook his head, “I have some things to deal with!”

Elder Yuan said, “If you don’t go now, they’ll think that you’re afraid!”

Yang Ye smiled, “They can do as they please.”

Yang Ye turned around and left the hall.

Elder Yuan fell silent for a moment, and then he left the hall as well and immediately went to give the Prediction Line a reply.

Two hours later.

“Yang Ye’s afraid! Yang Ye’s a coward!” Someone seemed to have started saying that about Yang Ye, and it swiftly spread throughout the Weapon Dimension. So, Yang Ye had become the laughingstock of the Weapon Dimension.

The coward, Yang Ye!

That was Yang Ye’s new title in the Weapon Path!

At this moment, Yang Ye was at the back of Gracious Mountain. Obviously, no one was taking care of the area, so it was covered in weeds that shot up over 3m from the ground, and all sorts of unknown and strange flowers bloomed here. It was a scenery that had its own beauty.

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings, and then he sat down cross-legged.

Admire!

As he gazed at the flowers, Yang Ye felt unprecedentedly calm, extremely calm, like the surface of an ocean that was untouched by even a wisp of wind.

A smile curled up on the corners of Yang Ye’s mouth.

The See Dao Realm!

What was the Dao?

It was all things!

The See Dao Realm was to see all things with the heart!

Just like that, time trickled by.

Suddenly, Yang Ye stood up.

Bang!

A terrifying aura swept out from him, but it only took a moment for the aura to return to his body and vanish without a trace. It was like the aura had never existed.

Yang Ye glanced at his hands and smiled, “See Dao! See Dao!”

The reason he didn’t agree to leave for the Prediction Line was that his bitter cultivation in the Primordial Pagoda had allowed him to attain a huge improvement in his Sword Dao. But besides that, he felt that he was on the verge of a breakthrough!

But a breakthrough required an opportune moment or fortuitous encounter. So, he’d decided to walk around.

He hadn’t expected that as soon as he calmed down, he attained his breakthrough with such ease. It was a truly pleasant surprise!

The See Dao Realm!

After being stuck for so long in the Hear Dao Realm, he’d instantly attained the See Dao Realm, and his strength had undergone a qualitative transformation.

Suddenly, Elder Yuan appeared in front of Yang Ye without making a sound.

Yang Ye glanced at Elder Yuan. He realized that the old man’s strength was much more terrifying than he’d ever imagined!

Elder Yuan sized up Yang Ye and said, “You’ve attained the See Dao Realm?”

Yang Ye nodded.

Elder Yuan spoke softly, “Someone from the Prediction Line is here!”

“The Prediction Line?” Yang Ye was stunned, “They’re here to cause trouble!”

Elder Yuan nodded, “Go meet him!”

Yang Ye nodded slightly, and then he transformed into a ray of light that vanished into the sky.

Meanwhile, Elder Yuan glanced at the surroundings. Countless flowers had been sliced into half here. It was the result of the aura Yang Ye emanated earlier.

Elder Yuan shook his head slightly, and then he waved his right hand lightly before vanishing on the spot.

Once Elder Yuan left, the flowers actually stood up once more.

They’d recovered completely!

…

The training grounds.

There was a young man standing there. He seemed to be around the age of 27 or 28. He wore white robes and stood ramrod straight like a sharp sword!

Suddenly, the young man opened his eyes, and a man in green clothes appeared in front of him.

It was Yang Ye, of course!

Yang Ye smiled, “You should be Ku Rongtian, right?”

The white robed man nodded, “Yes!” He sized up Yang Ye and continued, “They say you’re afraid of my Prediction Line, and that’s why you didn’t dare to come fight me. However, I think that you’re not someone who’s afraid of trouble.” nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Yang Ye smiled, “You aren’t here to chat with me, right?”

Ku Rongtian smiled and said, “Yang Ye, you’re not a fool, so you should be aware that the only reason he made you come here is so that he can use you. So, I don’t understand why you’re willing to let him?”

Yang Ye replied, “I won’t bother telling you why. Just tell me why you’re here. Do you want to fight, or are you here for something else?”

Ku Rongtian spoke indifferently, “Since I’m here, I’m naturally here to fight!”

Yang Ye smiled, “Make your move!”

Ku Rongtian nodded, “Come, let me witness the ability of the person Young Martial Uncle chose!”

He vanished on the spot once he finished speaking.

In an instant, a string of afterimages shot straight at Yang Ye. He was extremely swift to the point Yang Ye could only faintly catch sight of his figure.

However, Yang Ye didn’t bother to look. He just closed his eyes, and then he raised his hand and tapped forward.

Bang!

An explosion resounded throughout the training grounds, and then a figure was blasted away. The figure flew over 3km before finally stopping, and it was just a little bit away from being pushed out of the training grounds.

It was Ku Rongtian’s figure!

Ku Rongtian glanced at his hand. There was an extremely deep mark on them, and it was bone-deep!

Ku Rongtian fell silent as he gazed at his hands.

A short while passed before he gazed at Yang Ye, “Amazing!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he leaped up into the sky above Yang Ye, and then he overlapped his palms. A strange talisman appeared below his palms, and as soon as that happened, the space around him trembled!

A moment later, he slammed his overlapped palms down at Yang Ye.

The talisman crashed down at Yang Ye.

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly, and there was a wisp of solemness in his eyes. He didn’t dare act carelessly, and he raised his hand slightly and stabbed with his sword.

It accurately stabbed the talisman.

Bang!

The training grounds below Yang Ye’s feet shook, and the entire ground started to quake as well. At the same time, numerous thin barriers of light floated up from beneath the ground and covered the training grounds. As soon as the barriers of light appeared, the training grounds instantly stopped trembling.

At this moment, Yang Ye’s sword was raised before him, and the talisman was at its tip.

Yang Ye’s sword was trembling.

Suddenly, the talisman shook violently, and then a wave of powerful force swept out from it.

Bang!

Yang Ye was instantly blasted 3km away.

Boom!

As soon as his feet touched the ground, the entire training grounds shook violently once more.

Yang Ye glanced at his right arm. Many cracks had appeared on it, and it had been caused by the talisman.

“How unbelievable!” Suddenly, Ku Rongtian said, “This talisman is one of the supreme treasures of my Prediction Line, and it possesses unparalleled strength. I once used it to kill a Major Zen Realm expert. However, I never imagined that it was only able to injure you!”

Yang Ye glanced at the talisman floating before Ku Rongtian, and he said, “Indeed. Unfortunately, you’re too weak. If you were just a little strong, even I would probably have been heavily injured.”

A smile curled up on the corners of his mouth, “If it were in my hands, it would be much stronger!”

Ku Rongtian slowly clenched his left fist when he heard this, “It depends on whether you have the ability!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he stretched out his left hand and grabbed the talisman. The talisman shook violently, and then it flashed forward and slammed down at Yang Ye. The powerful energy contained within it caused the surrounding space to warp. It seemed like it was going to shatter the space here!

It was extremely shocking!

Yang Ye’s expression remained calm as he took a step forward, and then his sword vanished. An instant later, a pair of ethereal dragon claws appeared around his arms, and then he clamped down with them.

Bang!

His dragon claws clamped down upon the talisman.

Bang!

Yang Ye was instantly blasted over 1km away. However, he held on tightly to the talisman, but he was on the verge of being unable to endure the powerful energy contained within it.

When he saw Yang Ye had actually grabbed the talisman, Ku Rongtian had an extremely solemn expression on his face. At this moment, he was extremely shocked because even a Major Zen Realm expert would find it impossible to accomplish that with just physical strength.

Yang Ye’s physical strength had utterly surpassed his imagination!

Ku Rongtian restrained his shock, stomped his right foot down, and shot towards Yang Ye. Suddenly, a sword shot up from behind Yang Ye, and then it instantly transformed into a ray of light that arrived before Ku Rongtian.

Ku Rongtian raised his hand and slammed a punch forward!

Bang!

Yang Ye’s sword was stopped by his punch, and when he was about to attack again, his expression suddenly became extremely unsightly. It was because Yang Ye was smiling at him.

As for the talisman, it was gone.

The talisman had vanished!

Ku Rongtian stared at Yang Ye, “Where is it?”

“Where is what?” Yang Ye was stunned, “What are you talking about?”

Ku Rongtian spoke angrily, “Stop playing dumb!”

“Oh…” Yang Ye said, “You’re talking about that talisman. Er… Well that talisman is mine now, it’s mine. Understand?”

Ku Rongtian gazed at Yang Ye for a long time, and then he started moving his hands. It didn’t take long for numerous ripples to sweep out.

Summoning!

He was summoning the talisman back!

In the Primordial Pagoda.

A talisman shot up into the sky, and it slammed itself against the tiny golden pagoda that was floating high above in the sky.
