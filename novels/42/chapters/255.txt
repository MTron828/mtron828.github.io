Chapter 256 – What If I Gained The 1st?

Yang Ye’s expression turned slightly solemn. He would never underestimate any opponent, let alone Lin Xiuran who was Daoist Zui’s disciple. With Daoist Zui’s strength and resources, how inferior could the combat techniques cultivated by his disciple be? Perhaps it was impossible for Lin Xiuran to possess a Heaven Rank technique, but a mid-grade Earth Rank or high-grade Earth Rank technique was extremely likely!

Yang Ye took a deep breath while he took a step forward, and then the profound energy within his body instantly started roiling. After that, he said, “Come, let me see exactly what combat technique allows you to feel such confidence!”

“Haha!!” Lin Xiuran roared with laughter. He laughed for a while before he suddenly moved his hands and formed a strange seal before his chest. As soon as he formed the seal, strands of white colored sword qi surged ceaselessly from the hilt of his sword to the tip of it. However, when the strands of sword qi arrived at the tip of the black iron sword, they strangely stopped moving, and then they formed into a fist sized ball of white light....

“Sword qi converging at the tip of the sword. A thousand strands of sword qi transforming into one....” As he gazed at Lin Xiuran’s actions on the arena, Qing Yun’zi said in a low voice, “This is the sword technique Daoist Zui is famous for, the Infinite Flash Sword! Lin Xiuran is actually Daoist Zui’s disciple! What a surprise!”

“The might of this sword technique is extraordinary. However, I wonder how many percent of its might he’s able to display!” Yuan Tong spoke flatly from Qing Yun’zi’s side.

“Of course it’s extraordinary. Even though it’s a mid-grade Earth Rank technique, its might isn’t inferior to a high-grade Earth Rank technique at all. Not to mention that Lin Xiuran has comprehended Sword Intent. So, while it’s impossible for him to bring forth 100% of its might, he should be able to display at least 70 or 80% of it. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have bragged like he had just now!” said Qing Yun’zi in an indifferent tone.

Yuan Tong smiled, and then he said, “I look forward to seeing how Yang Ye will deal with it!”

At the moment she saw Lin Xiuran execute this combat technique, Su Qingshi’s beautiful brows couldn’t help but knit together once more while dense worry appeared in her eyes. She’d never imagined that her Martial Uncle Zui would have actually passed this technique down to Lin Xiuran. In terms of might, the Infinite Flash Sword was ranked at the top amongst all the Earth Rank techniques of the Sword Sect!

So, how could Yang Ye resist it?

On the arena, the white ball of light on the tip of Lin Xiuran’s black iron sword had transformed from a fist sized ball to a skull sized ball in less than two breaths of time. The energy contained within the white ball of light was extremely terrifying, and the space around the ball of light shook ceaselessly....

Yang Ye’s expression grew even more solemn as he gazed at the ball of light on the tip of Lin Xiuran’s black iron sword. Because even if they were over 30m apart, he was still able to sense the terrifying energy contained within the ball of light. It could be said that the combat technique Lin Xiuran executed was the most terrifying combat technique he’d witnessed until now. Even though he hadn’t seen this combat technique being launched yet, his intuition had told him all of this.

Yang Ye lightly let out a mouthful of air, and then with a twist of his wrist, he stabbed Violet Spirit into the ground beside him.

The countless spectators in the surroundings were stunned when they witnessed this scene. What’s he trying to do? Admit defeat?

After he stabbed Violet Spirit in the ground, Yang Ye gradually clenched both his palms into fists while the golden profound energy within his body surged like tidewater onto his fists.

Bang!

A light band resounded as the sleeves of Yang Ye’s clothes had instantly exploded into pieces to reveal Yang Ye’s bronze colored arms. As his profound energy surged ceaselessly into them, numerous veins that seemed like little snaked had started to gradually appear on his arms!

In next to no time, Yang Ye’s arms were covered densely in veins, and it seemed extremely terrifying!

At a certain moment in time, Lin Xiuran suddenly pushed forward with his hands that were still maintaining the strange seal from before. “Go!”

As soon as he finished speaking, the black iron sword and the skull sized ball of white light shot swiftly towards Yang Ye like a ray of light. Everywhere they passed, space shook incessantly as if it was on the verge of shattering into pieces, and the might it revealed was extremely terrifying to the point all the spectators below felt extremely shocked!

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed when he saw this scene. He pulled his fists back a little, and then he suddenly smashed them forward in the next instant.

“Dragonbreaker!” Along with this shout from Yang Ye, an enormous explosion of the air that sounded like a thunderclap resounded abruptly. The crowd was astounded, and then they looked over towards Yang Ye’s position. They saw two golden fists formed from energy had suddenly appeared in front of Yang Ye, and they were like two cannonballs. They shot out in single file and were accompanied by explosions of the air as they smashed violently towards the black iron sword and ball of white light!

The air in the surroundings was instantly sucked away wherever, these two golden energy fists passed, and even space showed faint signs of warping!

The expressions of the great figures on the walls of the Imperial Palace changed when they saw Yang Ye execute this technique, and it was even to the extent that the expressions of Bai Qi and Li Si who were the most indifferent before this had changed as well!

The Dragonbreaker was the combat technique that Emperor Zhou was famous for all those years ago! Of course, this wasn’t the reason their expressions had changed, and it was instead because they wondered why Yang Ye knew the Dragonbreaker technique that belonged to Emperor Zhou....

Under the astounded gazes of countless people, the two golden energy fists collided with the white ball of light. After an instant of deathly silence....

Bang!

An enormous bang that shook the heavens suddenly rumbled and resounded on the arena. After that, as soon as the two peerlessly ferocious forces encountered each other, they violently released the terrifying energy contained within them. In an instant, a terrifying wave of energy appeared in the air of the arena, and it whistled through the entire arena. Moreover, even space itself was actually struck by the terrifying energy to the point of warping and becoming fuzzy! Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Meanwhile, Yang Ye and Lin Xiuran were immediately blasted flying by the terrifying wave of energy, and at the same time that they were blasted flying, a bang resounded as the arena rumbled and collapsed once more....

When they witnessed this scene, the crowd was astounded. This was caused by profounders at the First Heaven Realm? Even King Rank experts might not be able to bring forth such terrifying might!

On the ruins of the arena, Yang Ye and Lin Xiuran lay there without moving. Right when everyone wondered who had won the battle, Yang Ye who lay on the ground had suddenly started standing up slowly.

As he gazed at the numerous fine injuries that had split the flesh on his chest, Yang Ye let out a lit sigh of relief and said, Fortunately, my physical body is strong, otherwise, I would have probably been heavily injured for a long time from the might of the collision between these two Earth Rank techniques. After stretching his body slightly, Yang Ye gazed at Lin Xiuran who lied on the ground without moving, and then his gaze turned icy cold.

Yang Ye didn’t hesitate to gesture with his hand, and the Violet Spirit sword that had been blasted flying by the wave of energy instantly flew back into his grasp. After that, he started walking slowly towards Lin Xiuran.

When he saw this scene, Yu Heng’s expression changed, and his figure flashed before he appeared on the ruins of the arena. However, right when he appeared here, both Li Si and Bai Qi had appeared before her at the same time.

“Exalt Yu Heng, you ought to be aware of the Ascension Rankings’ rules!” Li Si gazed at Yu Heng as he spoke.

Yu Heng glanced at Lin Xiuran who lay on the ground and said, “He has lost. Yang Ye has won the battle!”

“He hasn’t admitted defeat!” Li Si spoke indifferently. “So long as he hasn’t admitted defeat, then the competition hasn’t come to an end. Of course, it’s an entirely different matter if Yang Ye is willing to relinquish this opportunity to kill him.”

Yu Heng looked at Yang Ye when he heard this, and then he said, “Yang Ye, there’s no deep enmity between the two of you, so there’s no necessity for you to kill him, right? You have to understand that he’s Martial Uncle Zui’s disciple. So, killing him wouldn’t be beneficial to you at all!”

“I wouldn’t gain any benefit by refraining from killing him, right?” A wisp of a cold smile arose on the corners of Yang Ye’s mouth, and he said, “Moreover, Senior Yu Heng, I reminded you a long time ago that you should advise him not to offend me if you don’t want the Sword Sect to lose a genius. However, he chose me to be his opponent and intended to kill me. Allow me to ask you a question, why didn’t you advise him earlier? Or perhaps, only he, Lin Xiuran, can kill me, but I, Yang Ye, can’t kill him?”

Yu Heng was speechless when he heard this. At the beginning, he’d advised Lin Xiuran not to go against Yang Ye. Unfortunately, Lin Xiuran hadn’t listened to him. He was quite annoyed by this, but even though he was annoyed, Lin Xiuran still couldn’t die in the end.

Right when Yu Heng was about to say something, Yang Ye looked at Li Si and said, “Senior Li, can I continue?”

Li Si glanced deeply at Yang Ye, and then he turned to look at Yu Heng and said, “Exalt Yu, this Minister will repeat it one last time. Please leave at once. Otherwise, I won’t show mercy!”

Flames of rage flashed in Yu Heng’s eyes. However, he had no choice but to leave because he knew that Li Si was definitely not joking with him. Once Li Si and Bai Qi attacked, then their strength would surely be sufficient to make him perish on the spot. Moreover, he would have died for nothing. Because not only would the Sword Sect refrain from taking revenge for him, it would even have to offer an apology to the Grand Qin Empire and the other five powers.

Yu Heng glanced deeply at Yang Ye before his figure flashed and vanished on the spot.

After Yu Heng left, Bai Qi who’d been silent all along had suddenly looked at Yang Ye and said, “Kid, are you really going to kill him?”

Yang Ye smiled, and then he walked towards Lin Xiuran who’d fallen unconscious. He said while he walked, “Why would I not? Could it be that he would be grateful to me if I didn’t?”

“He’s the disciple of the Sword Sect’s Daoist Zui, and you’re a disciple of the Sword Sect as well. If you kill him, then not only would you offend Daoist Zui, you’ll even suffer the reputation of being one that killed another from his own sect. It isn’t worth it!” said Bai Qi.

“Reputation?” Yang Ye shook his head and said, “What’s the point of such a thing? Not to mention that my reputation is already so horrible, so what if it gets worse? In any case, it’s not important to me! As for Daoist Zui, I believe that a living genius is always more important than a dead one!”

When he heard this, a strand of admiration flashed in Bai Qi’s eyes as he gazed at Yang Ye, and then he said, “If you’re able to survive the battle with Yuan Tong, then come to my Bloodbath Camp, and I’ll guarantee your safety!”

Li Si frowned when he heard Bai Qi, but he didn’t say anything.

Yang Ye flicked his sword and Violet Spirit flashed past Lin Xiuran’s neck, causing Lin Xiuran’s head to be instantly swept into the air. After he did all of this, Yang Ye suddenly turned to look at Bai Qi before he said, “What if I gained the 1st?”
