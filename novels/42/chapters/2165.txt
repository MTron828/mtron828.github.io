Chapter 2166 – Leave!

Cultivation was endless!

Time trickled by, and six months had passed in the blink of an eye.

The middle aged man was focused on roasting a goat not too far away from the hall, and there was a young girl seated by his side. It was Tian Xiu. A little white thing was seated on Tian Xiu’s shoulder.

It was Snowy, of course!

At this moment, they were staring at the goat, and they were on the verge of drooling.

The middle aged man glanced at them and was quite amused. Besides running around all day, these two fellows spent the rest of their time getting him to roast goats for them. Especially snowy, she would give him an immortal crystal every time…

The great Martial Emperor had been reduced to a cook!

After flipping the goat around, the Martial Emperor gazed at Yang Ye. At this moment, Yang Ye’s figure was vanishing incessantly and appeared incessantly too.

Backstab!

Yang Ye was focused on it.

Throughout this time, he’d cultivated it to the point it was as fast as when he was in the outside world!

The Martial Emperor watched for a short while, and then he nodded, “It’s barely fast enough now.”

Possessing such speed under such circumstances while at the Major Zen Realm was not bad indeed. Now, once Yang Ye left the hall, then besides being unable to pose a threat to progenitors, the speed and strength of his technique was something that Sages could absolutely not resist.

He wasn’t a Sage, yet he possessed strength that surpassed Sages!

“It’s almost time!” The Martial Emperor spoke softly, and then he tore off a goat leg and passed it to the two little fellows. They exchanged glances, and then Tian Xiu took the leg. Just like that, the little fellows started eating!

Not long after, Yang Ye suddenly stopped and walked out of the hall. As soon as he did that, Yang Ye was stunned!

It was an indescribable feeling!

In the hall, he felt the powerful pressure of the energy of the universe, and it made his speed decrease countless times when compared to the outside world. But once he got used to the gravity there and emerged from it, he noticed to his shock that he wasn’t used to the outside world now.

“It’s very normal!” Meanwhile, the Martial Emperor suddenly said, “It’ll take a few days to get used to it. Presently, your body’s ability to adapt is completely different from others. It’s a good thing for you.”

Yang Ye relaxed when he heard this. He walked over to the Martial Emperor, cupped his fist, and said, “Thank you!”

The Martial Emperor shook his head, “There’s no need to thank me. I merely brought you here.”

Yang Ye smiled and didn’t say anything. He gazed at Tian Xiu and Snowy, and Snowy immediately flew over to his shoulder and ceaselessly rubbed her head against his cheek. Tian Xiu grinned too when she saw Yang Ye.

Yang Ye rubbed Snowy’s head and smiled, “Both of you should have had lots of fun throughout this time, right?”

Snowy nodded. She’d been really free during this time, and she could explore this planet!

Yang Ye smiled, and then he gazed at An Nanjing. The latter was still training. However, she wasn’t training with techniques, she was training in ordinary basic moves.

“She should be done soon!” The Martial Emperor suddenly said, “Both of you can leave once she’s done!”

Yang Ye nodded because it was time to leave. They’d been here for around six months, and he could only wonder how Yang Lianshuang and the others were doing right now.

Now, he just had to wait for An Nanjing to be done!

Yang Ye glanced at the middle aged man and said, “Senior, can I ask you something? Do you know the race from the Initial Civilization?”

“The Initial Civilization?” The middle aged man glanced at Yang Ye, “You actually know about them.”

Yang Ye replied, “I found out by chance!”

The Martial Emperor pondered deeply for a moment and said, “The Initial Civilization is the most ancient among all the races of our large universe, and it’s the most mysterious. It’s even more mysterious than the void spirit race and prehistoric race. There are practically no records about them in our universe, and only a pitiful few know about their existence.”

He gazed at Yang Ye, “I’m quite surprised that you do!”

Yang Ye asked, “Senior, you know about them too?”

The Martial Emperor spoke softly, “I don’t know much. I only know that they left this universe.”

They left this universe!

Yang Ye was quite disappointed. He shook his head and said, “Actually, the current large universe isn’t at a dead end either. I came into contact with them, and they said that there is a teleportation formation here. However, the living beings of our large universe are too weak, so unless all the living beings in the entire large universe work together, it’s impossible to activate it. But Senior, I’m sure you’re aware how complicated the situation between all the organizations in this universe is. So, while it isn’t impossible to make everyone work together because everyone wants to survive, I don’t think anyone will believe me!”

“Indeed!” The Martial Emperor continued, “There is a huge formation in this large universe, but activating it will cost everyone a huge price. Once we pay that price but fail to leave, and then powerful enemies appear, then we’ll all be finished.”

New novels chapters are published ᴏn !

Yang Ye said, “If you step forward, then perhaps…”

“Me?” The Martial Emperor shook his head, “Don’t put your hopes in me. The large universe is extremely complicated, and I’ll probably get exhausted to death if I interfere. Of course, the most important reason is that I’m not that free to mind other people’s business.”

Yang Ye laughed bitterly, “I thought you were a righteous person. Didn’t you say that with great power comes great responsibility?”

The Martial Emperor shot a sideways glance at Yang Ye, “Not at all.”

He fell silent for a short moment and continued, “Actually, if it’s within my ability, then I can help. But the problem is that the organizations in the large universe are in a complicated state, and everyone only cares about their own interests. So, if you make me be the good guy, they may consider me annoying, and I refuse to complete a thankless task like that. Moreover, even if I do it, will the three paths, the Alliance of All, and all those other organizations listen?”

Yang Ye spoke solemnly, “Then are you going to just watch as the large universe dies like this?”

The Martial Emperor shrugged, “You make it sound like the destruction of the large universe is my responsibility!”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

Meanwhile, the Martial Emperor said, “Forget about all of that. We just have to mind our own business. As for the large universe, just let them do as they please, and they can think of their own way out when they are finally at a day end.”

Yang Ye said, “Their way out is to take Snowy from me!”

“Haha!” The Martial Emperor roared with laughter, “So, in the end, your intention to help the large universe was fake, and you just want to help yourself! If I step forward and contact all the organizations of the large universe, their attention will fall onto that formation and not you, right?”

Yang Ye wasn’t embarrassed by this, “That is what I’m thinking. However, I’m not afraid even if they come for me. I’ve never been afraid of killing.”

The Martial Emperor grinned, “All of that has nothing to do with me!”

Yang Ye smiled, “Senior, what do you care about?”

The Martial Emperor glanced at him, “Kid, you’re really curious, and that’s not a good thing.”

He suddenly gazed at An Nanjing at this point. Meanwhile, she walked out of the hall and arrived before them. The Martial Emperor sized up An Nanjing and asked, “How do you feel?”

She nodded, “Very good!”

The Martial Emperor nodded slightly and said, “Sages are no threat to you now. However, don’t underestimate progenitors. Even I dare not underestimate them. Not one of the progenitors from the four paths are ordinary, and their true strength is a mystery. Anyway, you can describe them as being unfathomable. Besides them, there are some other mysterious living beings that can’t be underestimated too. In short, don’t think that you’re invincible.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he turned around and walked away.

Meanwhile, An Nanjing suddenly asked, “Where are you going?”

The Martial Emperor stopped, “A place I’ve wanted to go to for a very long time. You have to tread on your future path on your own. However, I’m confident in you, and I’d be even more confident if you leave this fellow. The trouble this fellow is in are very troublesome.”

He glanced at Tian Xiu when he spoke up to this point, “Even if this little girl grows up, she may not be able to deal with the trouble he’s mixed up in. That person is truly formidable!”

He vanished into the sky once he finished speaking. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

An Nanjing gazed at Yang Ye, “I’ll always be by your side!”

Yang Ye’s heart felt warm, “I know!”

An Nanjing nodded slightly and didn’t speak further.

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings, and then he gazed at Snowy and Tian Xiu, “Hurry up and eat! We’ll leave once we’ve finished eating!”

Snowy cracked a smile, and then she tore off a leg from the goat and brought it to Yang Ye.

Yang Ye chuckled and gazed at An Nanjing, “Come! Let’s eat together and leave after that!”

She nodded and didn’t refuse.

Just like that, they started gobbling down the entire roasted goat.

Snowy wasn’t really satisfied. She gazed at Yang Ye, and then started waving her claws quickly.

She was telling him that they should go to the middle aged man who roasted goats in the future!

Yang Ye chuckled and rubbed Snowy’s head, “You’re the only one who dares to make the Martial Emperor roast goats!”

After that, he took Snowy and Tian Xiu in his arms before vanishing into the sky.

An Nanjing followed behind him.

In the sky, right when they were about to leave the planet, Tian Xiu suddenly looked down. Her gaze gradually became icy cold, and something soundlessly appeared on her forehead.

Netherworld Destiny!
