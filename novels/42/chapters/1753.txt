Chapter 1754 – The Invincible Yang Clan!

Yang Ye closed his eyes slowly when he heard her.

He didn’t resist, nor could he.

Because he was utterly exhausted right now.

What was in his mind right now?

Nothing.

Sleep!

All he wanted was to sleep. At this moment, it wasn’t just his body that was exhausted to the extreme, even his mind was completely exhausted. Sleep, he wanted and needed to have a good rest.

Tired!

This period of time had been tiring both physically and mentally to him!

Everyone here was looking at Yang Lianshuang.

So long as she squeezed down just a little, Yang Ye’s head would be separated from his body, and even Qiong Qi wouldn’t be able to save him. Because Qiong Qi was too far away from Yang Ye, and he wouldn’t be able to do anything even if he was right by Yang Ye’s side.

Would Yang Lianshuang do it?

Actually, as far as the others were concerned, she had a reason to kill him. Because only Yang Ye and the other 6th stage True Realm expert of the Yang Clan could pose a threat to her. If Yang Ye died, then no one in the Yang Clan would be able to fight her for the position of patriarch.

To kill or not to kill?

Everyone watched as Yang Lianshuang suddenly withdrew her hand and said, “Take him to my room. No one should disturb him during that time!”

She suddenly looked up at the sky, remained silent for a moment, and then a vicious glow flashed through her eyes, “Give my order. From this moment onward, the Yang Clan is in alert level red. All experts outside the clan must rush back as soon as possible. Anyone who disobeys this order will be killed without mercy!”

Yang Lin and the others nodded, and then they vanished on the spot.

Yang Lianshuang looked up at the sky for a long time before she said, “Our trouble has just begun….”

As soon as she finished speaking, she vanished on the spot.

Two days later.

Yang Ye's eyes opened slowly.

“You’re awake?” A voice came from the side.

Yang Ye turned to look, and he saw a woman in a black dress standing by the nearby window.

It was Yang Lianshuang.

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings and asked, “I’m alive?”

She turned around and looked at him, “Do you want to die?”

He gazed at her, “Why didn’t you do it?”

She replied with a question, “Why should I?”

Yang Ye replied, “Just as you said, once I’m dead, there’ll be no one left in the Yang Clan who can pose a threat to your position as patriarch.”

Yang Lianshuang walked over to the side of his bed and said, “Are you a threat if you’re alive? No, you aren’t! Because you have no interest in being the patriarch. Besides that, I only offend those who offend me.”𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Yang Ye gazed at her for a long time before she said, “I hope we work well together!”

She nodded slightly, “Me too!”

Since they started working together, they’d only truly trusted each other at this moment. As for their cooperation before this moment, both of them had been vigilant against each other. Yet now, they trusted each other.

Meanwhile, Yang Lianshuang asked, “Can you walk?”

Yang Ye asked, “Why?”

She replied, “Come somewhere with me.”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and replied, “Give me some time.”

She nodded slightly, “I’ll be waiting.”

She turned around and left.

Yang Ye closed his eyes once more as he laid there on the bed.

Inspecting his body!

Even though he was awake, his injuries hadn’t recovered completely. Or it should be said that they were still very severe. Because he didn’t even have the strength to move a finger right now. He opened his eyes and looked at his right arm. It was completely motionless just like before.

Of course, it was because of the talisman.

At the same time that he’d killed Yang Xiang, he’d hurriedly sealed his right arm with the talisman again. Because the Wargod’s arm was getting too strong, and it was about to exceed the absolute limits of his body.

Even though it was sealed, the strength of the Wargod’s arm and Divine Yin Flame caused his body to be severely injured.

Fortunately, he had Primordial Violet Energy, so it hadn’t harmed his foundation.

Recovery!

At this moment, he had to focus on recovery, and it was naturally not a difficult thing for him.

Just like that, his body gradually returned to normal under the healing effects of his Primordial Violet Energy.

Four hours later, Yang Ye left the room, and Yang Lianshuang was waiting there.

She sized him up and asked, “You’re alright now?”

Yang Ye nodded, “More or less!”

Yang Lianshuang gazed at Yang Ye for a long time and said, “The most extraordinary aspect about you isn’t your strength, it’s your recovery. Your recovery is something that even my Undying Energy can’t compete with!”

“Undying Energy?” Yang Ye asked, “What’s that?”

She replied, “A type of energy of self-recovery that phoenixes are born with.”

“No wonder!” Yang Ye nodded. Yang Lianshuang had suffered heavy injuries during the battle too. Even though they hadn’t been as severe as his, they weren’t light injuries. Yet now, Yang Lianshuang seemed completely fine. Obviously, it was because of her Undying Energy!

“Let’s go!” She turned around and left.

Yang Ye followed after her.

Yang Lianshuang led Yang Ye to a graveyard. It was huge and covered in graves.

“This is where the fallen experts of the Yang Clan are buried!” Yang Lianshuang continued, “Many of them aren’t able to advance further, exhaust their lifespans, and are transformed back into dirt. There are also some who died in battle for the Yang Clan.”

Yang Ye asked, “What are we doing here?”

“We’re here to see someone!” As she spoke, she started walking towards the depths of the graveyard. Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and followed her.

It didn’t take long for a tattered cottage to appear before them. There was an old man in front of the cottage. He wore a tattered robe. The robe seemed like it hadn’t been washed for years, and it was impossible to discern the robe’s original color.

At this moment, the old man had a small knife in his grasp, and he was carving something on a stone tablet.

Yang Lianshuang bowed slightly, “Ancestor.”

The old man’s hands stopped for a moment, and then he looked at Yang Ye and Yang Lianshuang. In the end, his gaze fell on Yang Ye. He remained silent for an instant before he said, “You look alike!”

Yang Ye asked, “Alike to what?”

The old man withdrew his gaze and continued his carving, “A kid who once said he would make the Yang Clan invincible!”

Invincible! Yang Ye knew that the old man said he looked like his father. Yang Ye gazed at the old man, “Senior, you know him?”

The old man nodded, “I do. I loved to come here and play. As time passed, we got to know each other better.” He paused for a moment and continued, “He’s a genius. Since the formation of our Yang Clan, I’m afraid only the founding ancestor’s natural talent could compare to him! If he hadn’t suffered misfortune, the Yang Clan would have been glorious.”

Meanwhile, Yang Lianshuang said, “The Yang Clan will definitely be glorious in the future!”

The old man stopped carving.

He remained silent for a long time before he glanced at Yang Ye and Yang Lianshuang, “It’s rare that both of you aren’t fighting to the death.”

Yang Ye explained, “I’ve never wanted to be the patriarch!”

“I see!” The old man nodded slightly and said, “I know why both of you are here. As I’ve said in the past, I won’t interfere in the Yang Clan’s business. I don’t care who is the patriarch. So, you can rest at ease.”

The old man continued carving once he finished speaking.

Yang Lianshuang fell silent for a long time before he said, “Ancestor, are you just like Yang Xiang? Do you care about nothing but life and death?”

The old man said, “I never still care. Can any living person truly sever all ties and remain indifferent to all relationships? But… Little Girl, let’s be a little realistic. My line is almost at its end. Even though we all still belong to the Yang Clan, our ties are so weak they practically don’t exist!”

He paused for a moment and continued, “Moreover, I don’t like to interfere with the matters of the outside world. Just as you’ve said, the clan and authority are nothing to us. Only staying alive is real to us.”

Yang Lianshuang nodded, “I understand.”

She gazed at Yang Ye, “Let’s go!”

Yang Ye glanced at the old man and was about to leave with Yang Lianshuang when the old man suddenly asked, “Kid, is your father still alive?”

Yang Ye stopped, gazed at the old man, and shook his head, “I don’t know. Why?”

The old man said, “It’s not a big deal. He borrowed my saber, but I didn’t expect him to run away with it. Besides that, he borrowed some defensive treasures from me as well. He promised to return them….”

Yang Ye felt speechless.

Around 15 minutes later, Yang Ye and Yang Lianshuang left the graveyard.

Yang Lianshuang took a deep breath and gazed at Yang Ye, “From today onwards, the Yang Clan will have to rely on us.”

Yang Ye replied, “How did the other clans react to the events in the Yang Clan?”

“They naturally intend to reap benefits from it!” Yang Lianshuang laughed coldly, “That is how the world works. When you’re weak, others will come to bully you. I’ve received word that the Ying Clan, Li Clan, Wang Clan, and Lu Clan have started to act against our territory. However, they aren’t doing it that openly!”

Yang Ye asked, “What do you intend to do?”

She gazed at him, “What do you think?”

Yang Ye replied, “You’re the patriarch!”

She looked him in the eyes, “You too!”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “What do you mean?”

Yang Lianshuang explained, “From today onwards, the Yang Clan doesn’t belong to just one person. It belongs to everyone. As for you, you’re the Yang Clan’s guardian from now on. Your authority and status is equal to the Yang Clan’s patriarch.”

Yang Ye was about to speak when Yang Lianshuang continued, “I know what you want to say. Don’t refuse. You must realize that your current strength is utterly insufficient to guarantee the safety of Merak System. Isn’t it?”

Yang Ye fell silent because it was a fact.

Meanwhile, Yang Lianshuang added, “I’ve sent people to Merak System. If nothing unexpected happens, they’ll bring your loved ones to the Milky Way System. From today onwards, they won’t just be your loved ones, they’ll be members of the Yang Clan!”

Yang Ye gazed at her in silence.

Meanwhile, she suddenly grabbed his arm and said, “Let’s go.”

Yang Ye asked, “Where?”

She fell silent for a moment, and then a smile curled up on the corners of her lips, “As they say in the world of mortals, to ascend the throne.”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.
