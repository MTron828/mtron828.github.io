Chapter 1716 - Yang Ye, You’re Still Too Kindhearted!

Needless to say, Yang Shun’s words amused Yang Ye!

Using external sources of strength?

Yes, he’d used the wooden sword and done that. But was that shameless?

He didn’t want to rely on treasures, but it depended on the situation! At this moment, the five of them were ganging up on him. If he didn’t use the wooden sword, then he would really be quite pedantic.

However, the wooden sword wasn’t that important to him anymore. He would never rely on it like he had in the past. But he wouldn’t intentionally stop himself from using it as well. After all, one’s mentality was the most important when using external sources of strength!

Yang Shun’s expression was quite unsightly, and his expression grew even more unsightly when he noticed the ridicule in Yang Ye’s eyes.

Actually, he’d realized that he’d misspoken as soon as he spoke those words. After all, it wasn’t a fair fight between them and Yang Ye, it was a battle of life and death. Moreover, five of them were ganging up on Yang Ye, and even their cultivations were higher than him. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Under such circumstances, Yang Ye would be an absolute fool to not use any treasures in battle!

Yang Ye didn’t waste his breath. He tapped his right foot down, and the space below him rippled.

At the same time, Yang Ye’s figure vanished on the spot.

Yang Shun’s expression instantly changed drastically at the sight of this, “Watch out!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye had appeared before one of the old men, and the wooden sword had arrived just three inches away from the old man’s forehead.

That old man was horrified. It was impossible for him to flee now!

Take an injury and save his life!

That was what the old man thought right now, and it was what he did. At the critical moment, he grabbed Yang Ye’s wooden sword with his left hand. However, at the instant that he grabbed it, the wooden sword suddenly spun.

Hiss!

A stream of blood sprayed into the air along with the old man’s left hand. However, the old man was safe. Because he’d moved over 1km back when his hand was sliced off.

At the same time, Yang Shun and the others arrived by his side.

At this moment, all of them were grouped up!

They didn’t dare to split up!

At this moment, not one of them dared to go head-on against Yang Ye while he was using the wooden sword. They couldn’t resist his attacks because trying to would result in either injury or death!

Yang Ye started walking slowly in their direction. He didn’t attack and just walked towards them, and he was even walking quite slowly like he was on a stroll!

Yang Ye didn’t release his aura as a Zenith Realm expert or any one of his intents. However, all five of them felt pressure that struck at their hearts.

Pressure!

Invisible pressure!

It was like the unexplainable pressure that subjects felt when facing their emperor. It wasn’t something that came from the body, and it was something that was felt mentally.

At this moment, that was how Yang Shun and the others felt!

Yang Ye was still walking with the wooden sword in his grasp. He didn’t attack, and Yang Shun’s group didn’t attack as well.

Just like that, Yang Ye arrived 30m away from them.

Suddenly, Yang Shun said, “Let’s go.”

As soon as he finished speaking, all five of them vanished on the spot.

Yang Ye stopped when they vanished. He wasn’t surprised that they’d left.

Because from the moment that they didn’t dare to attack him, a crack had appeared in their mental state. They felt fear towards him while he held the wooden sword. None of them was confident in their ability to deal with him and the wooden sword, so they chose to retreat.

If they didn’t retreat and tried to fight him, then at least three of them would die here!

Yang Ye looked down at the wooden sword, and it didn’t take long for it to vanish from his grasp.

Yang Ye shook his head slightly, “It’s not my sword after all!”

If the wooden sword acknowledged him and became one with him, then his combat strength would improve by at least a level. Unfortunately, while it was willing to let him use it twice a month because of Snowy, it rejected him!

Suddenly, a ray of light appeared before Yang Ye, and then a woman was standing in front of him.

It was the Sword Spirit who hadn’t taken human form for a very long time!

She said, “I’m leaving!”

Yang Ye was slightly stunned, “Where are you going?”

The Sword Spirit fell silent for a moment and replied, “I’m of no help to you right now. So, it’s pointless to stay by your side.”

Yang Ye shook his head, “How can you think like that?”

She replied, “It’s a fact!”

He looked her in the eyes, “You’re not just a sword to me.”

She gazed at him and asked, “Then what am I?”

He replied, “A comrade in battle, a friend, and a loved one.”

She fell silent.

Yang Ye added, “Sword Spirit, you and Zi’er have been with me for the longest time, and you’re the sword that knows me the best. Your place in my heart is equal to Zi’er, Su Qingshi, and the others.”

She lowered her head slightly and fell silent for a long time before she said, “But I can’t help you anymore. Only it can help you.”

It!

The wooden sword, of course!

Yang Ye shook his head slightly, “As far as I’m concerned, even a hundred wooden swords can’t compare to you. As for what you said about it being the only one capable of helping me. It is very strong indeed, but it isn’t my sword. I’m just using it for now. Moreover, there are no weak swords, and there are only weak people. Right?”

In his heart, she wasn’t just a sword, she was family.

It was also why he’d never given up on Heavenrend. It was because he didn’t want to feel useless. Even though he rarely spoke to her, he knew how she thought, just like she knew him!

There was no need for many words between them!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye added, “The path ahead is a long one. Accompany me on it, alright?”

She gazed at him for a long time and nodded, “Alright, we’ll take that path together!”

As soon as she finished speaking, she transformed into her true form and appeared in Yang Ye’s grasp.

Yang Ye glanced at the sword in his grasp, and a smile curled up on the corners of his mouth, “We’ll go all the way together!”

Suddenly, Yang Ye frowned. He issued a command in his heart, and the scroll Qin Youshui gave him appeared in front of him. It didn’t take long for his face to become icy cold. In the end, killing intent appeared in his eyes!

The Yang Clan hadn’t sent only Yang Ling to Merak System, it had sent other experts there as well!

The Yang Clan’s goal was very clear. They hoped to capture his family and use them to take control of him.

Obviously, they would have to pay a huge price to kill him. But if they targeted his loved ones, then they wouldn’t have to lose anything.

Yang Ye fell silent for a moment, and then he vanished on the spot.

Yang Ye flew through space on his sword.

He was extremely swift now. Even True Realm experts would find it difficult to match his speed. It was because he was using the Spatial Laws, Laws of Speed, and the Laws of Darkness. All three Laws were being used to improve his speed. This made his speed faster than even the eye could see!

It didn’t take long for him to travel along the path the Qin Clan had provided and finally catch up to that expert from the Yang Clan.

This time, the expert heading to the Yang Clan was none other than the Yang Clan’s guardian, Yang Gewu!

When he saw Yang Ye, Yang Gewu gazed at Yang Ye for a long time before he said, “Looks like someone really is helping you in secret!”

Yang Ye glanced at Yang Gewu, “I didn’t expect it to be you!”

Yang Gewu replied, “I’m a member of the Yang Clan. Anyone who threatens the Yang Clan is an enemy of mine.”

Yang Ye fell silent for a moment and said, “Make your move!”

Yang Gewu nodded, “Alright!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Gewu vanished on the spot, and he was in front of Yang Ye when he appeared again. In an instant, countless spear images enveloped Yang Ye.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye made his move.

In an instant, ten rays of light appeared around him, and the spear images vanished without a trace.

However, at the moment they vanished, the tip of a spear arrived just five inches away from Yang Ye’s forehead.

Yang Ye’s expression didn’t change at all. He just moved his head slightly to the side and made the spear pass right by his forehead. At the same time, his sword suddenly swept towards the left.

Bang!

A muffled explosion resounded, and then Yang Gewu appeared over 100m away. There was a tiny golden shield protecting his abdomen!

Yang Gewu glanced at the cracks on his shield, and then he looked up at Yang Ye, “I truly never expected you to grow to such an extent in just this short while.”

Yang Ye didn’t waste his breath, and he just took a step forward. As soon as he did that, a sword arrived just a few inches away from Yang Gewu’s throat!

Yang Gewu’s expression changed drastically. He hadn’t expected Yang Ye’s attack to actually be that fast. It had completely exceeded his expectations. Fortunately, his reaction wasn’t slow, and he’d raised his spear to defend himself at the critical moment.

Clang!

An ear piercing clang resounded. Yang Gewu was blasted over 300m back, but he hadn’t even been able to stop himself before a sword appeared in front of him again!

This time, the shock in his heart was at its limits!

Yang Ye’s speed and rhythm in battle was absolutely too quick! It was so swift that he wasn’t able to handle it!

Of course, he wouldn’t just sit there and wait for death to arrive. He’d swiftly stabbed his spear forward at the instant the sword arrived in front of him.

Clang!

An ear piercing sound of metal colliding resounded. Yang Gewu was blasted 300m back again. This time, he didn’t have another chance to attack.

Because Yang Ye’s sword was pressed against his forehead.

He’d lost!

Yang Ye looked Yang Gewu in the eyes and said, “That day, you helped me outside the Ku Clan, and I’ve never forgotten that debt I owe you. Now, I’ll spare your life, and we’re even. I won’t show mercy if we meet again!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye turned around.

Yang Gewu stood on the spot and gazed at Yang Ye. He was about to speak when his eyes suddenly opened wide, and they were filled with astonishment. He instinctively tried to flee from where he stood, but it was still too late.

A hand had suddenly emerged from within his chest, and it was holding a bloody object.

It was Yang Gewu’s heart!

“Yang Ye, you’re still too kindhearted. I’m a little disappointed!” Meanwhile, a voice resounded.
