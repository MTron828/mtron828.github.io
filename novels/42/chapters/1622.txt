Chapter 1623 - The Yang Clan’s Number One Genius!

Translator: InVader

Even though saving Little Sky was the most important thing to him, improving his strength was important too. After all, the greater his strength was, the greater his chances of saving Little Sky were.

The Yang Clan was no ordinary clan!

“Calm down for a while!” Lu Lige continued, “It isn’t so easy to get. We have to make plans. Understand?”

Yang Ye asked, “Is it dangerous?”

Lu Lige nodded, “Extremely dangerous. Because that place is where a clan specially grows Rebirth Fruits. They are the only clan that has Rebirth Fruits in Milky Way System. They rely on it to gain wealth for themselves. So, do you think it’ll be dangerous?”

“Only they have Rebirth Fruits?” Yang Ye asked, “Why?”

“The Rebirth Tree!” Lu Lige explained, “They have a Rebirth Tree. Up until now, they have the only Rebirth Fruit in the entire Milky Way System. Of course, Milky Way System is huge, so I’m not very sure if there really aren’t others throughout Milky Way System. Moreover, perhaps other clans have it as well, but they just didn’t reveal it.”

Yang Ye asked, “Which clan?”

Lu Lige spoke in a low voice, “The Wu Clan!”

Yang Ye asked, “Are they very strong?”

Lu Lige sized up Yang Ye and said, “You’re definitely one of the young masters of the Yang Clan, right?”

A wisp of surprise flashed through Yang Ye’s eyes, “How did you know?”

Lu Lige rolled his eyes, “You don’t even know the Wu Clan. That means you were definitely sent away to temper yourself. You’re back now to participate in the Yang Clan’s fight for succession, right?”

Yang Ye nodded.

Lu Lige asked, “You returned on your own?”

Yang Ye nodded, “Yes.”

“You don’t have help?”

“A few.”

Lu Lige was stunned, “Only a few?”

Yang Ye replied with a question, “Then how many do I need?”

Lu Lige shook his head, “You’re finished. You’re dead.”

Yang Ye felt speechless.

Meanwhile, Lu Lige continued, “You know that fellow, Yang Yao. Do you know how many powers are supporting him? His mother’s clan, the clans of his wives, and the power he created himself… Moreover, he isn’t the one with the most backing amongst the potential successors of the Yang Clan.”

Yang Ye didn’t know what to say.

Suddenly, Lu Lige said, “Actually, you’re not completely without a chance. If you can gain the support of your Yang Clan’s Yang Lianshuang… Tsk , tsk. You’ll have a very good chance.”

“Yang Lianshuang?” Yang Ye asked, “Who’s that?”

“Your Yang Clan’s number one genius!” Lu Lige explained, “She’s extraordinary. I heard she was only half a step away from the Zenith Realm a year ago. Now, she may have attained the Zenith Realm. To be honest, if she was male, then all of you can just go home and give birth to kids. Unfortunately, she isn’t male, and the Yang Clan only allows males to succeed the position of patriarch. Otherwise, how can any of you compete with her?”

The Zenith Realm! Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly. Yang Lianshuang was probably no more than 30 years old. If she really was at the Zenith Realm, then she would be a Zenith Realm expert that wasn’t even 30 years of age. Coupled with the fact that such monstrous geniuses could surmount their realms of cultivation to do battle, just thinking about her strength was terrifying!

Lu Lige continued, “Her strength isn’t even the most terrifying part. The most terrifying part is her prestige in the Yang Clan. It can be said that she is the representative of the Yang Clan’s younger generation. So, if you’re able to gain her help, then you’ll have a much greater chance.”

Yang Ye shook his head, “Instead of relying on others, it’s better to rely on myself. Let’s not talk about that anymore; let’s talk about the Rebirth Fruit instead. Can I really attain the Rebirth Realm by consuming that fruit?” Even though his current strength wasn’t bad, it was quite inferior when compared to those true monstrous geniuses.

Not to mention others, just Lu Lige wasn’t someone he was absolutely confident in being able to kill. After all, this fellow before him had the ability to kill Zenith Realm experts too. He had trump cards, and so did everyone else!

“It’s not definite!” Lu Lige explained, “It’s only useful to people with extremely strong foundations. Only such people dare to consume it. Otherwise, if someone who just attained the Dualism Realm or possesses a shaky foundation consumes it, it wouldn’t be of any use. Even if they are able to attain the Rebirth Realm by force, it would definitely leave many problems behind. Moreover, such a person’s strength would definitely be far inferior to a normal Rebirth Realm expert.”

He sized up Yang Ye and continued, “Your aura is deep like an ocean. It’s obvious your foundation is exceptionally strong, so you can consume one.”

Yang Ye nodded, “Come, let’s go take it from them!”

“Are you crazy?!” Lu Lige spoke angrily, “What do you think the Wu Clan is? Take it from them? Even a group of 10,000 people like us won’t be able to return alive.”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “If we don’t take it from them, then are you telling me that we should ask them for it? Would they give it to us? Or perhaps you mean we should steal it?”

“Tsk, tsk!” Lu Lige sized up Yang Ye and said, “Either take or steal. Were you a bandit in the past?”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

Lu Lige said, “Forget such thoughts. The Wu Clan’s strength is beyond your imagination. You’ll only be courting death if you try something like that. We’re going to do it the right way this time. The Wu Clan somehow obtained a wooden sword and a stone tablet. They placed it in front of their Martial Hall, and they promised that anyone able to comprehend their secrets will be able to obtain two Rebirth Fruits and enter the Wu Clan’s Martial Dao Hall to study the Wu Clan’s martial arts.”

“A wooden sword? A stone tablet?” Yang Ye was puzzled, “What’s that?”

Lu Lige shook his head, “I’m not really sure. In any case, we can go try our luck. What if we’re able to uncover their secrets?”

“Do you think it’s some sort of trap?” Yang Ye continued, “What if they kill us to keep us quiet after we uncover their secrets?”

“They won’t!” Lu Lige continued, “The Wu Clan’s reputation is very good. They will absolutely not do something like that. So, how about we give it a try?”

Yang Ye thought for a moment and said, “Let’s try it then.”

Lu Lige nodded, “Let’s go!”

“Wait!” Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings and said, “Protect me for a while.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he sat down cross-legged in space and sent a clone into the Primordial Pagoda.

Within the Primordial Pagoda.

As soon as Yang Ye’s clone arrived, Snowy and Zi’er appeared in front of him, and Snowy was holding an earthen yellow ball of light.

The Earth Spirit!

The ball of light was the Earth Spirit!

Snowy brought the ball of light over to Yang Ye. Yang Ye was just about to take it when the earthen yellow ball of light suddenly went behind Snowy.

Snowy blinked, and then she patted it lightly with her claw and seemed to be telling it something.

A short while passed before the Earth Spirit slowly floated over to Yang Ye, and then it touched Yang Ye lightly.

Yang Ye grinned and touched it lightly as well.

An Earth Spirit!

He’d seen one in the past, that Earth Spirit on Sky Sky Continent. The Earth Spirit contained the energy of the earth, and it could be said to be an extraordinary armor. Unfortunately, he couldn’t take the Earth Spirit of Sky Sky Continent with him. Because if he took it with him, it would be a huge blow to Sky Sky Continent.

If a world lacked the spirit of the earth, then it represented that continent’s vitality would gradually vanish.

Yang Ye fell silent for a moment, and then he gazed at the Earth Spirit, “Can you help if I need it in the future?” VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

The Earth Spirit hadn’t even replied when Snowy had hurriedly nodded. After that, she seemed to have thought of something, and she hurriedly grabbed the Earth Spirit in her arms and nodded again.

Yang Ye chuckled, and then he took Snowy in his arms and kissed her. This little fellow is truly too cute!

After playing with Snowy and Zi’er for a while, Yang Ye went to the 3rd level. At this moment, An Nanjing was still seated cross-legged on the ground. However, the tiny golden figure above her was gradually growing ethereal. Obviously, it was coming to an end.

Even though his strength had improved tremendously because of that black hole, he was confident that An Nanjing’s strength would definitely not be inferior to him when she woke up. Because An Nanjing’s strength would certainly undergo a qualitative transformation after fully absorbing the inheritance of the Martial God.

Meanwhile, Xiao Yuxi walked over to him, “We’re in Milky Way System?”

Yang Ye took her hand and nodded, “We’re not too far from the Yang Clan.”

Xiao Yuxi tightened her grip on his hand, “Be careful!”

Yang Ye nodded. He chatted with her for a while, and then he left the Primordial Pagoda.

In the outside world.

Yang Ye opened his eyes. As soon as his eyes were open, he saw Lu Lige. Lu Lige was staring at him without blinking.

Yang Ye asked, “What are you doing?”

Lu Lige glanced at him and moved aside, “I thought you fell asleep.”

Yang Ye felt speechless.

Lu Lige shook his head, “Let’s go. The Martial Origin System isn’t close by.”

As he spoke, his figure transformed into a ray of light that vanished into the distance.

Yang Ye quickly followed him.

However, they hadn’t gone far before their expressions changed. After that, they stopped. Moreover, they even flashed 3km backwards.

Meanwhile, the space where they’d been standing at just a moment ago had suddenly started to tremble, and then five old men appeared in front of them.

Five Zenith Realm experts!

The leader of the group was an old man in a grey robe. Besides that, three of the old men behind the grey robed old man weren’t new faces to Yang Ye and Lu Lige. Because those three old men were the same Zenith Realm experts who’d fought them earlier.

“The Wang Clan’s Wang Yun.” Lu Lige stared at the grey robed old man, “He isn’t someone we can defeat. We…”

Suddenly, Yang Ye raised his hands, “I surrender!”

Lu Lige was stunned speechless.
