Chapter 1614 - The Ultimate Version Of The Laws Of Darkness!

Translator: InVader

Yang Xuan’s face was terrifyingly gloomy. She turned towards the side. There were five black robed figures there. All of them were enveloped by black robes and enveloped by mysterious energy, so even she couldn’t see their faces clearly.

However, only an idiot wouldn’t be able to discern their identity.

Yang Xuan spoke coldly, “Is your young master and young miss that afraid of my nephew?”

“Afraid of him?” The black robed man who led the group chuckled with ridicule, “Phoenix Commander, do you think he has any right to make my young master and young miss fear him?”

Yang Xuan said, “Since they aren’t afraid, then why have they repeatedly sent people to kill my nephew?”

The black robed man chuckled, “Phoenix Commander, don’t you know why? If you weren’t trying to use him to draw your brother’s old subordinates to your side, would my young master and young miss pay any attention to him? After all, he’d just the son of an exiled member of the clan. Right, my young miss and young master asked me to give you a message. Your older brother’s time is over. Phoenix Commander, it’s best if you stop thinking about some things. Otherwise… Haha…”

As soon as he finished speaking, he laughed coldly and vanished on the spot with the other black robed figures.

A cold smile curled up on the corners of Yang Xuan’s mouth, and then she gazed at the position Yang Ye had vanished from.

The armored figure spoke softly, “Young Miss, he…”

Yang Xuan gazed at that point for a long time, and then she said, “Let’s go back and wait for him.”

The armored figure asked, “Young Miss, you think he’s still alive?”

Yang Xuan laughed coldly, “If it was anyone else, or even if I were to be swept into a vortex within a black hole, I would probably be unable to survive. But he… Don’t forget that he has comprehended the Laws of Darkness!”

The Laws of Darkness! The armored figure’s eyes lit up. The black holes were formed from unknown dark matter, so black holes were extremely safe to those who’d comprehended the Laws of Darkness!

Meanwhile, Yang Xuan said, “It’s not wise to stay here. Let’s go.” Her figure shook and vanished on the spot.

Once she vanished, the others vanished after her.

…

Pain!

Overwhelming pain!

That was what Yang Ye felt right now. At the instant when his figure was swept into the dark vortex, he felt like a million blades were slicing him apart, and his entire body felt like it was about to be reduced to pieces. Fortunately, he quickly utilized the Laws of Darkness, and then the pain was alleviated slightly. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Once he recovered slightly, Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings. He was surrounded by pitch black darkness, and a mysterious wave of energy was ceaselessly moving about. He didn’t know what energy it was, but he had no doubt that it was formed from dark matter. Because that energy couldn’t affect him at all after he utilized the Laws of Darkness.

After staying on the spot for some time, Yang Ye was about to leave. However, a thought suddenly appeared in his mind.

Can I absorb that energy?

Yang Ye hesitated for a moment and decided to give it a try. He immediately circulated the tiny vortex within him. As soon as he did that, a wave of suction force surged out from the Primordial Pagoda, and then the energy in the surroundings instantly surged into him like a torrent.

Yang Ye was delighted by this, and he hurriedly immersed his consciousness within his body.

Once the Primordial Pagoda absorbed the energy, it didn’t take long for strands of energy to flow out of it and into Yang Ye’s body. Yang Ye was stunned when he saw the energy. Because it wasn’t Primordial Violet Energy, and it was an even purer form of the dark energy from before!

It was more than ten times purer than the dark energy around him!

Once they entered Yang Ye’s body, they were swiftly absorbed by his body. However, it didn’t take long for even more of that pure energy to flow out from the Primordial Pagoda.

Just like that, the Primordial Pagoda absorbed, converted, and provided purer energy for Yang Ye’s body to absorb.

Yang Ye noticed that his body seemed to be gradually undergoing a transformation.

If someone was watching from outside the black vortex that Yang Ye was in, that person would notice that the black vortex was gradually shrinking.

Time trickled by. In the blink of an eye, ten days had passed.

At this moment, Yang Ye was still in the black hole. However, the black vortex he was in had vanished without a trace. Because he’d absorbed all the energy within it!

Suddenly, Yang Ye opened his eyes, and then the black hole around him actually trembled violently. After that, it started to spin slowly like a vortex. Something else worth mentioning was that Yang Ye’s eyes had actually turned pitch black!

A moment of silence ensued, and then he suddenly stretched his right hand forward and clenched it. In an instant, the huge black hole he was in started to spin like a cyclone!

Yang Ye fell silent for a short while, and then he took a step left. As soon as he did that, the entire black hole actually moved slightly to the left. However, it was very subtle, so he wouldn’t have even noticed it if he hadn’t comprehended the Laws of Darkness.

Yang Ye was stunned when he noticed this, and then he felt delighted. After that, he moved around 30m to the left, and the black hole actually moved 30m to the left as well. However, it was utterly impossible to notice from the outside because the black hole was too huge.

Yang Ye stood on the spot and glanced at himself. Based on his outward appearance, nothing had changed. However, he was very well aware that his body wasn’t really the same anymore. It wasn’t just his body, even his Laws of Darkness wasn’t really the same anymore!

Especially the Laws of Darkness. Previously, his Laws of Darkness could only prevent him from being injured within the black hole. Yet now, his Laws of Darkness could control the black hole. He didn’t know how huge it was, but he knew that it was definitely not smaller than a small world!

It could be said that the gap between his previous Laws of Darkness and his current Laws of Darkness was like the gap between the earth and the sky!

He’d noticed something. Even if he didn’t utilize the Laws of Darkness, nothing would happen to him in the black hole. It was like he’d become completely immune to dark energy! He knew that it was definitely because of his body!

No matter what, it was a good thing, or it should be said to be a very good thing!

The transformation of his body allowed him to become fully immune to all harm from dark energy and dark matter. As for the improvement in his Laws of Darkness, it made him able to control all dark energy and dark matter. For example, this black hole.

Besides that, if he fought someone now, he could enter that person’s shadow without the person noticing at all, and then strike a lethal blow against that person. His Laws of Darkness was capable of doing that in the past, but it had become useless against cultivators at the Deity Realm and above.

Yet now, his Laws of Darkness had improved. Coupled with the changes in his body, it could be said that killing a Rebirth Realm expert without making a single sound wasn’t a problem to him at all. Not to mention Rebirth Realm experts, it was even possible for him to assassinate Zenith Realm experts!

After all, he still had the Sword Domain. The Sword Domain combined with the unique characteristics of his body and the Laws of Darkness would make him difficult to detect, even for Zenith Realm experts. Of course, if a Zenith Realm expert was completely vigilant, then it would be difficult for him to kill that expert with a single lethal blow.

There was one more important thing, and it was his new ability to control black holes!

Just think about it. If he brought this black hole to Merak System… It could be said that if no one stopped him from doing that, then once he brought the black hole to Merak System… Once he brought the Merak System into the scope of the black hole’s suction force, then the entire Merak System would be swallowed into the black hole, and the only way to prevent it would be to destroy the black hole. However, could anyone accomplish that?

Of course, there definitely were existences who could destroy the black hole, but such existences were definitely few. In any case, Zenith Realm experts were absolutely incapable of accomplishing that. After all, Yang Xuan and the others had been absolutely careful when traveling through the black hole.

However, while it seemed great when he thought about it, reality was brutal. While he could move the black hole, he couldn’t move it far. Based on his estimations, his current strength was only sufficient for him to move it a few tens of thousands of kilometers. After all, controlling the black hole exhausted a huge amount of physical strength and mental strength.

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts, glanced at the surroundings, and spoke softly, “Should I tell Shadow Maiden…” He seemed to have thought of something at this point, and he shook his head.

He’d wanted to bring Shadow Maiden into a vortex within the black hole so that she could improve her Laws of Darkness like he had. However, it didn’t take long for him to reject that thought. Because it was impossible. The main reason he’d been able to improve his Laws of Darkness and change his physique was the Primordial Pagoda!

The Primordial Pagoda had absorbed the dark energy, converted it into a purer form of dark energy, and then allowed him to absorb that energy. Thus, his physique was changed, and his Laws of Darkness was improved. However, Shadow Maiden didn’t have the Primordial Pagoda. So, the most she would be able to accomplish upon entering a vortex in the black hole was to avoid being injured and devoured by it!

Yang Ye shook his head, glanced at the surroundings, and then vanished on the spot.

The black hole was absolutely huge. Yang Ye flew on his sword for almost a day yet had still not reached the end of it. On the second day, he finally felt like he was at the edge of it.

Around four hours later, Yang Ye finally left the black hole, and he only stopped upon leaving the range of its suction force. After that, he glanced at the surroundings, and his face fell when he saw the scene around him. This expanse of outer space wasn’t the same one he had been in when he entered the black hole.

Where am I? Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings while standing on the spot. Suddenly, he looked far away towards his left. After that, his figure shot off in that direction. Because he sensed the aura of the living there.

It didn’t take long for Yang Ye to stop because an armored man had suddenly appeared not too far ahead of him. There was a tiny ‘杨’ character on the armored man’s left chest.

It was a Rebirth Realm expert!

Yang Ye cupped his fist, “May I know…”

The armored man sized up Yang Ye and spoke coldly, “Fuck off!”

Yang Ye’s face stiffened, and then he said, “I just want to ask for directions. Can you…”

“Since you refuse to leave, then die!” As soon as he finished speaking, the armored man instantly appeared before Yang Ye, and then he slapped his palm down at Yang Ye’s head.
