Chapter 1573 - Who Created The Sprite Palace?

Translator: InVader

Even though Yang Ye was just a Deity, the Sword God’s Pavilion didn’t dare to act against him.

Yang Ye didn’t just possess the Stellar Sword Diagram, he possessed Returnal Rank sword intent and the Sword Domain. Just his Sword Domain and sword intent made it so that ordinary sword energy and sword formations were useless against him.

Moreover, once Yang Ye activated the Stellar Sword Diagram, even Sword God’s Pavilion couldn’t endure the consequences of that!

Meanwhile, Yang Ye suddenly said, “I came here with a question for all of you. After I arrived at the large world, a mysterious power has been acting against me. According to my knowledge, the Human Alliance may be their puppet. Since you belong to the Human Alliance, do you know about that power?”

All the people here exchanged glances. Meanwhile, Xiao Tianyi spoke abruptly, “Elders, you may leave.”

The five old men glanced at Xiao Tianyi, and then they vanished on the spot.

Once they left, Xiao Tianyi remained silent for a long time before he spoke again, “That power is very mysterious.”

Yang Ye’s eyes narrowed slightly, “You know about it?”

Xiao Tianyi nodded, “I know a little. Founding Ancestor Wuji made contact with them all those years ago.”

“Senior Jian Wuji made contact with them?” A wisp of surprise flashed through Yang Ye’s eyes. He hadn’t expected that Jian Wuji had actually made contact with that power.

Xiao Tianyi explained, “The Sword God’s pavilion had just been established at that time, and a mysterious expert came with the intent of making us work for them. Founding Ancestor Wuji naturally refused, so he fought that expert. Founding Ancestor Wuji won, of course. However, it didn’t end there. That mysterious power sent an even stronger expert, but that expert lost as well.”

Yang Ye asked, “What happened in the end?”

Xiao Tianyi spoke solemnly, “Founding Ancestor Wuji vanished for some time, and he returned later on. From that time onward, that mysterious power didn’t send another expert to look for trouble with us.” He paused for a moment at this point, and then he added, “Founding Ancestor Wuji was injured when he got back!”

He was injured?! Yang Ye slowly clenched his fists. He had no doubt that Jian Wuji was extremely strong. Since they could injure Jian Wuji, Yang Ye could imagine how terrifying that power was!

Meanwhile, Xiao Tianyi added, “Before Founding Ancestor Wuji left, he told us to not offend that power. So long as Sword God’s Pavilion doesn’t offend them, they won’t offend us. That’s the agreement Founding Ancestor Wuji made with them all those years ago.”

Xiao Tianyi gazed at Yang Ye when he spoke up to this point, “Yang Ye, Founding Ancestor Wuji was absolutely strong at that time, and he even had the Stellar Sword Diagram! However, even he could only choose to make a compromise with them. What I’m trying to say is… How many people like him exist in our human race? As for a power that doesn’t have such an existence, can they resist that mysterious power?”

Yang Ye fell silent.

Xiao Tianyi added, “Besides that, how strong is the Nether Pavilion? Especially their Sky Maiden, Blood Maiden, and Blind Maiden. How heaven defying is their strength? However, they were still forced to flee to the lower dimensions.”

Xiao Tianyi paused for a moment and continued, “Yang Ye, you can be considered to be the founding ancestor’s successor, so let me give you a piece of advice. Leave Sky Sky Continent immediately. Don’t get yourself mixed up in the Nether Pavilion’s business.”

Yang Ye remained silent for an instant, and then he said, “Did you tell them to leave because the forces of that power may have infiltrated Sword God’s Pavilion?”

Xiao Tianyi fell silent.

“I understand.” Yang Ye nodded, and then he turned around and left.

Once Yang Ye left, Xiao Tianyi remained silent for a long time, and then he shook his head, “A storm of blood…”

Yang Ye departed for Sprite Palace once he left Sword God’s Pavilion.

Even though Xiao Tianyi hadn’t confirmed it, Yang Ye knew the answer. That power had infiltrated Sword God’s Pavilion. Moreover, Xiao Tianyi was fully aware of it yet didn’t dare to do anything about it!

The Nether Pavilion!

In the past, he was extremely confident in the Nether Pavilion because he was very well aware how strong Blind Maiden, Blood Maiden, and the others were. Yet now, he started to feel worried for them. That mysterious power was truly strong. Moreover, based on the current situation, that power was completely prepared and waiting for the Nether Pavilion to return to the large world.

Once the Nether Pavilion came, chaos would spread through Sky Sky Continent. Because that power’s forces were spread throughout the various powers on the continent. Once a battle broke out, it would definitely affect the entire continent.

Yang Ye shook his head, restrained his thoughts, and stopped thinking about it. There were many things that made no difference regardless of how much thought one gave it. He didn’t have the ability to stop all of it. As far as he was concerned, the most important thing to him was to locate that mysterious power and rescue Zi’er. As for everything else, he could take it one step at a time!

One day later, Yang Ye arrived at Sprite Mist Mountain.

Sprite Mist Mountain was the headquarters of the Sprite Palace. Sprite Mist Mountain wasn’t on the ground but amidst the clouds and mist in midair. The clouds and mist weren’t ordinary, and they were formed by a Sprite Lord instead. It could be said that the Mist Sprite Lord was a natural defensive formation for the Sprite Palace. Moreover, the formation could move. So long as the Sprite Palace willed it, it could be moved at any moment.

Sprite Palace could be said to be the most mysterious power that was known throughout the continent. Everyone knew it existed, but few had actually entered it. Besides Sprite Lords and other sprites, Sprite Palace didn’t welcome any others. Yang Ye was only asked to come to Sprite Palace because the Sprite Lord was with him.

As soon as he arrived below Sprite Mist Mountain, Snowy and Little Sky Flame emerged from within Yang Ye. Both the little fellows looked up at Sprite Mist Mountain, and there was a trace of curiosity in their eyes while Little Sky Flame’s eyes even carried a trace of excitement.

Yang Ye rubbed their heads and asked, “Both of you want to head up there?”

Little Sky Flame hurriedly nodded. As for Snowy, she hesitated for a moment before she nodded.

Yang Ye smiled, “Then let’s go!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye took them in his arms and shot up into the sky. When he arrived around 300m away from the mountain, a huge expanse of mist suddenly appeared around him. The mist descended upon him in waves. However, it didn’t harm him and just surrounded him.

Yang Ye was about to do something about it when Snowy suddenly opened her mouth and breathed in lightly. In an instant, the mist was sucked into her belly.

Little Sky Flame blinked while admiration filled her eyes.

Snowy immediately seemed quite self-satisfied when she noticed the admiration in Little Sky Flame’s eyes.

“Eh?” Suddenly, a soft exclaim of surprise came from the top of the mountain, and then the space before Yang Ye trembled. After that, a woman in a red dress appeared before them.

She was beautiful and had a slender figure, but her entire body was fiery red. Even her hair and eyes were fiery red.

A Sprite King!

The woman’s gaze instantly descended onto Snowy and Little Sky Flame, and the expression on her face gradually became gentle.

Meanwhile, Snowy and Little Sky Flame were looking at her too. Yang Ye noticed that there was no vigilance in their eyes and only curiosity.

In the end, the woman gazed at Yang Ye, “Let’s talk somewhere else?”

Yang Ye nodded.

Just like that, Yang Ye followed her to the peak of Sprite Mist Mountain. There were no buildings there. The peak was huge, and Yang Ye noticed numerous Sprite Kings there. There were all sorts of Sprite Kings like Mist Sprite Kings, Water Sprite Kings, Lightning Sprite Kings, Wing Sprite Kings, and some that he hadn’t even heard of.

All of them were coming towards his group. They paid no attention to Yang Ye and just gazed at Snowy and Little Sky Flame. Snowy wasn’t able to just join them, but it didn’t take long for Little Sky Flame to become friends with them. In the end, Little Sky Flame dragged Snowy over. After Snowy joined the group, Yang Ye noticed that all the Sprite Kings immediately surrounded Snowy.

All of them really liked Snowy and kept trying to make her play with them. Snowy was gradually able to let go and become friends with them.

“We didn’t know that she was imprisoned by the demon race!” The red clothes woman spoke abruptly, “If we knew, we would have absolutely not stood by idly.”

Yang Ye remained silent.

She suddenly added, “Let her stay here, alright?”

Yang Ye’s face turned cold, and he was about to instinctively refuse. However, he suddenly gazed at Snowy. At this moment, both Snowy and Little Sky Flame were very happy. They were extremely happy.

Suddenly, Little Sky appeared by Yang Ye’s side, “Let her stay!”

The woman in a red dress frowned when she saw Little Sky.

Meanwhile, Little Sky waved at her and grinned, “If I’m not wrong, you’re the Heavenblaze Emperor Flame’s daughter, right?”

The woman spoke in a low voice, “You know my mother!”

Little Sky nodded, “I think I do, but I’m not very sure. In any case, it isn’t important!” She turned to gaze at Yang Ye and continued, “Let Snowy stay here.”

Yang Ye asked, “Why?”

Little Sky replied, “It’s her responsibility, and it’s the best place for her!” Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Responsibility? What responsibility?”

Little Sky turned to look at the other Sprite Kings, “She can counter those Sprite Kings, but she can help them as well. If they have her help, they’ll be able to grow swiftly, and she’ll be able to use the various types of energy they possess to cultivate and speed up her growth. They supplement and restrict each other!”

Meanwhile, the woman in a red dress said, “Moreover, this is the safest place for her.”

“The safest?” Yang Ye gazed at her, “Why?”

She answered, “No power will offend us.”

Yang Ye asked, “Why?”

Meanwhile, Little Sky pointed at the Sprite Kings in the distance, “Those little fellows are definitely no threat to you if they fight you in single combat. But if they join forces, then even ten of you will be no match for them. They consist of Sprite Kings of every form of energy in the world. So, if they will it, their joint forces can instantly make all the energy here vanish and transform this place into a place that’s completely empty. As for Snowy, if she grows a little more, she can suck away all the spirit energy throughout Sky Sky Continent!”

Little Sky gazed at Yang Ye and continued, “Everyone will be finished once there’s no spirit energy left!”

Yang Ye was at a loss for words.

“There’s another reason!” Meanwhile, Little Sky suddenly added, “They are where Little Little Sky and the others’ limits lie!”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Their limits?”

Little Sky explained, “Do you know who created Sprite Palace?”

Yang Ye glanced at her and said, “Don’t tell you did it.”

Little Sky frowned, and she thought for a while before she said, “I think it really was me…”

Yang Ye felt utterly speechless.
