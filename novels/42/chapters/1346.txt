Chapter 1347 – A Power On Par With The Nether Pavilion!

At this moment, Yang Ye’s killing intent seemed as if it had solidified!

He’d never expected Mo Xiaoleng to actually target Zi’er and Snowy, and he’d never expected her to actually get an expert from outside this world to help her!

At the moment Yang Ye shot up into the sky, Mo Xiaoleng and the huge fiery claw had vanished within the ocean of fire. Yang Ye’s speed didn’t slow down at all, and he transformed into a ray of light that shot into the ocean of fire. It didn’t take long for it to be slashed open by Yang Ye, and he continued upwards.

Zi’er!

Snowy!

Yang Ye raised his speed to its limits. All the remaining profound energy he had was utilized without restraint. Far away at the end of his vision, he could see Mo Xiaoleng and the huge claw had arrived before an expanse of grey energy. Right when Mo Xiaoleng and the huge claw that held Zi’er and Snowy were about to enter the grey energy, the wings on Yang Ye’s back flapped, and then Yang Ye transformed into a fine ray of light that arrived behind the huge claw.

“You’re courting death!” A voice that carried boundless pressure suddenly resounded from far beyond the grey energy, and then a ball of fire flashed out from the grey energy and shot towards Yang Ye.

Bang!

The sword energy Yang Ye emanated was shattered, and his figure crashed down from the sky. In an instant, he crashed deep into the ground. But it only took a moment for a ray of light to charge up into the sky again. In next to no time, Yang Ye arrived before the grey energy. But both the huge claw and Mo Xiaoleng were gone.

Yang Ye’s instantly were instantly filled with ferocity. He stomped his right foot down and swung the Sword Precursor at the grey energy.

Bang!

The grey energy shook violently, and then it bounced back the energy within Yang Ye’s attack. Yang Ye was instantly slammed down from the sky. After he descended around 3km downwards, Yang Ye slammed his right foot down and stopped himself. After that, he transformed into a ray of light that shot up into the sky.

“You can’t be allowed to live!” Suddenly, a voice resounded from behind the grey energy. After that, a huge fireball suddenly emerged from behind the grey energy.

Yang Ye’s pupils constricted. It was extremely dangerous because the tiny vortex within him had started to warn him. The tiny vortex usually only gave him warnings when he couldn’t resist something. In other words, the fireball wasn’t something he could resist right now!

Even then, Yang Ye refused to stand by idly and wait for death to arrive!

He immediately sheathed the Sword Precursor and was about to draw it. However, a woman suddenly appeared in front of him just before he drew his sword. Yang Ye was slightly stunned when he saw her because it was Blind Maiden!

Blind Maiden didn’t speak. She just tapped her finger forward. Just that caused the huge fireball to shatter, and countless threads of flames rained down towards the surroundings. Everywhere they passed, space seemed to be incinerated and huge spatial rifts appeared in their wake. Suddenly, Blind Maiden stretched her hand upwards and waved it slightly.

Just that caused all the flames in the sky to vanish, and the damages in space were instantly repaired as well.

A moment of silence ensued before a voice resounded from behind the grey energy, “The Nether Pavilion!” The voice was filled with seriousness and a trace of fear.

Blind Maiden looked up at the sky, remained silent for a moment, and then said, “Fuck off!”

“After so many years, all of you are still so overbearing and arrogant. I hope you’ll be able to be like that forever!” The voice resounded once more from behind the grey energy. But the voice had become very soft by the time the last word was spoken. Obviously, that expert was gone.

A wisp of ferocity arose on the corners of Yang Ye’s mouth, and he was about to charge up into the air. However, Blind Maiden stopped him. She shook her head slightly, “They’ve gone very far away. You won’t be able to catch up!”

Yang Ye’s entire body shuddered while slaughter intent ceaselessly surged out from him. At the same time, his hair and eyes gradually turned red. Suddenly, Blind Maiden tapped a finger against the center of his forehead. Yang Ye’s killing intent completely vanished in an instant.

Yang Ye glanced at her, took a deep breath, and said, “I lost my composure.”

She withdrew her hand and said, “You were almost controlled by your slaughter intent.”

Yang Ye nodded, “I know!”

Blind Maiden suddenly said, “Actually, their departure isn’t a bad thing for you!”

Yang Ye gazed at her and asked, “What do you mean?”

Blind Maiden answered, “That little fellow of yours, Snowy. Her background is extraordinary. It wouldn’t be a problem for her to be by your side in the lower dimensions. Because there are very few in these worlds that can recognize her background. But if it’s in the higher dimensions like those medium sized worlds that are completely intact, it’ll be extremely dangerous for you. Because many would want to obtain her. Or I should say, many would want to become friends with her. Even I once had the thought to take her from you!”

Yang Ye frowned, “What exactly is she? Why would you want to take her from me as well?!”

“She’s a Sprite Lord!” Blind Maiden continued, “When experts like us arrive at a certain level, we need an extremely huge amount of spirit energy to advance further. It isn’t something that just ordinary spirit veins can satisfy. We need the spirit energy of an entire world. For example, if I wanted to advance a step further, I would need the spirit energy of around an entire medium sized world. However, we’re utterly incapable of converging the spirit energy throughout a world within a short while.”

Yang Ye said, “Snowy can do that, right?”

Blind Maiden nodded slightly, “While she can’t accomplish that right now, she’ll be able to in the future. So, if she stays by your side, it’ll be very dangerous for both you and her. If you didn’t know Nether Maiden and the others, I would have acted against you by now. Because she’s equivalent to a shortcut for me to improve my cultivation.”

A wisp of bitterness arose on the corners of Yang Ye’s mouth, “I never expected that I would still be unable to protect them!”

She shook her head and said, “Don’t compare yourself with those who are too much stronger than you. Just like that fellow just now. He has been alive for at least a few tens of thousands of years, so you’ll only be looking for trouble by comparing yourself to him. You have to realize that your strength is really good for your age, and you just need time.”

Yang Ye remained silent for a long time before he said, “Would those fellows hurt them?”

Blind Maiden replied, “They wouldn’t dare to!”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Why?”

She pondered deeply for a few moments before she said, “There’s a power in the large world, it’s called the Sprite Palace. It’s a power formed by sprites!”:

Yang Ye frowned, “A power formed by sprites?”

Blind Maiden nodded lightly, “Everything in the world has a spirit of its own. Once a consciousness is born within such things, their minds and intelligence aren’t inferior to us humans. At one point in time, one of them created the Sprite Palace, and then it started to recruit all the sprites in the world. As more and more joined, the Sprite Palace grew stronger and stronger....”

She paused for a moment at this point and continued, “The Sprite Palace isn’t inferior to our Nether Palace.”

Yang Ye’s pupils constricted. He knew how strong the Nether Pavilion was. But Blind Maiden had actually said that the Sprite Palace wasn’t inferior to the Nether Pavilion!

Yang Ye suppressed the shock in his heart and asked, “There’s a connection between them and Snowy?”

“Of course!” Blind Maiden continued, “Even though sprites are rare, there are many of them in this universe of ours. However, there’s only a single Sprite Lord in a universe. Because Sprite Lords are too terrifying. They are so terrifying that even the Supreme Heaven Dao fears them and doesn’t dare give birth to more. Now that Snowy has appeared here, it means that the last Sprite Lord of the Sprite Palace has either fallen or left this universe.”

Yang Ye spoke solemnly, “You’re saying that Snowy will become the master of Sprite Palace?”

Blind Maiden nodded, “Only she is qualified to become the master of Sprite Palace. Because she’s innately immune to all laws and the attacks of all sprites. Moreover, she can suppress all sprites. Now you understand why she exists? There’s a natural counter to everything in the world. Some sprites are too powerful to the point that even the Supreme Heaven Dao fears them. So, a Sprite Lord was born, a Sprite Lord that can suppress and counter all other sprites. It’s the Supreme Heaven Dao’s way of balancing to world!”

“The Supreme Heaven Dao?” Yang Ye frowned. Suddenly, he felt that he was very ignorant.

“You’ll find out in the future!” She continued, “You just have to know that the Divine Phoenix Clan would definitely not dare to harm her. Of course, they’ve definitely captured her with the intention of using her. She hasn’t matured completely, so she’s very easy to trick....”

Yang Ye spoke firmly, “I’ll go get her back!”

Blind Maiden remained silent for a long time before she spoke again, “Before this, I really didn’t understand why they would have become friends with you. Recently, I understood a little. I can sense that your feelings for her are real, and it has no motives behind it. That’s very rare and precious. I also believe that you would still go get her back even if she wasn’t a Sprite Lord. Right?”

Yang Ye shook his head and said, “At this moment, I really wish that she was just ordinary and not that Sprite Lord you spoke of.”

Blind Maiden remained silent for a short while, and then she patted him lightly on the shoulder and left. A short while later, her voice came slowly from afar, “If nothing unexpected happens, the Stellar Sword Diagram will be yours soon.”

Yang Ye was stunned, and then he turned around to look at the source of the voice. But Blind Maiden was gone.

“The Stellar Sword Diagram!” Yang Ye took a deep breath, and then he looked up at the sky. An expanse of grey energy covered the sky above him, and it stretched out until the ends of his vision. Obviously, it covered the entire continent. Because it was that ‘restriction’ around Dark Hell Continent!

Outer space was right beyond it!

Yang Ye gazed at the grey energy for a long time, and then he tightened his grip on the Sword Precursor and said, “Zi’er, Snowy, wait for me! It won’t take long, not long at all....”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye turned around and vanished on the spot.
