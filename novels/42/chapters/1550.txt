Chapter 1551 - I Feel A Little Bad!

Translator: InVader

His cultivation was showing signs of advancing!

At this moment, the venom mixed with Primordial Violet Energy was madly stimulating his body. Based on his past experience, he knew that it was a sign that he was about to advance!

Yang Ye wasn’t delighted but horrified!

If he was at any other place, it would definitely be a tremendously good thing. He would enter the Primordial Pagoda and charge into the Deity Realm. However, this was the Demon Territory, and if he was being watched by countless spectators. If he were to advance now, his identity as a human would definitely be exposed.

He would definitely fail if he tried to advance right now!

Suppress it!

Yang Ye hurriedly immersed his mind into his body and said, “Primordial Pagoda, take back that pure energy. I can’t advance right now, I really can’t.”

A moment of silence ensued, and then the tiny vortex stopped sending that pure energy to Yang Ye. At the same time, it reabsorbed all the energy which was stimulating Yang Ye’s cultivation.

Yang Ye heaved a sigh of relief.

If he were to advance now, his identity would definitely be exposed. Most importantly, the Eye of the Heaven Dao would definitely come because he would be advancing outside of the Primordial Pagoda. Besides that, he wasn’t very confident in his ability to charge into the Deity Realm right now. He’d just attained the Semi-Deity Realm, so he needed time to consolidate his strength and not charge into a higher realm of cultivation!

It was best to advance steadily!

Even though he couldn’t advance for now, Yang Ye didn’t feel that it was a pity. Because the pure energy was within the Primordial Pagoda, and he could use it when he needed it.

Suddenly, Ku Moye asked, “How did you do that?!”

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts and gazed at Ku Moye, and then he smiled, “I told you, I’m immune to all poison!”

Ku Moye gazed at Yang Ye for a long time, and then he said, “You’ve won!”

He’d admitted defeat!

Admitting defeat was humiliating at most times, but there were many times when it wasn’t. Ku Moye’s current admission of defeat wasn’t humiliating. Because he’d done his best, and he’d even used his trump card. But he still wasn’t able to harm Yang Ye.

If he still tried to fight now, he would be beaten to death!

Gu Mo appeared in the ring. He glanced at Ku Moye and Yang Ye, and then he said, “The Goat Clan’s Xiao Yang is victorious!”

As soon as he declared Yang Ye’s victory, countless demon beasts started cheering. Man Shi and the others were the loudest. Yang Ye was their friend, so they were naturally the happiest when they saw Yang Ye defeat Ku Moye.

Yang Ye nodded slightly to Gu Mo, and then he turned around and left the ring. This win represented that he was in the top three. In the beginning, his target was only the top three, but he hadn’t expected Man Shi and the others to bet everything they had on him.

Now, he had to strive to obtain the first.

Meanwhile, Ku Yuan suddenly walked over and glanced at Yang Ye, “Congratulations!”

Yang Ye smiled, “I’ll see you in the finals!”

Ku Yuan shook his head, “It’s difficult!”

Yang Ye asked, “What? You’re not confident?”

Ku Yuan smiled, “I’m naturally confident. However, you may not know that Blue Bird well. She isn’t ordinary. No matter what, we’ll know the outcome in a while.”

Yang Ye nodded, “I’ll be watching!”

Ku Yuan nodded slightly, and then he turned around and left.

Suddenly, Yan Lingxue came over to Yang Ye. She was a woman, and she was extremely beautiful if Yang Ye judged her based on human standards. Especially her legs, they were much longer than other women, but they didn’t seem out of place and were very gorgeous instead!

Yan Lingxue sized up Yang Ye and said, “I’ve never heard of you!”

“I kept a low profile!” Yang Ye smiled, “My patriarch said that my Goat Clan is too weak, so I should keep a low profile.”

“I see!” She nodded slightly, “I’ll see you in the finals!” As soon as she finished speaking, she turned around and walked up the ring.

She’ll see me in the finals! Yang Ye glanced at her. She’s really confident.

He didn’t know how strong she was, but he’d experienced how strong Ku Yuan was. Ku Yuan’s strength was really not bad. At the very least, Ku Yuan’s physical strength far surpassed Ku Moye. However, she was still so confident.

She’s not ordinary!

Meanwhile, Gu Mo announced the start of the battle. Ku Yuan and Yan Lingxue immediately started to fight each other. However, they didn’t return to their true form and fought in human form.

They were probing each other!

Even now, they were still just probing each other and hadn’t really gotten serious.

Yang Ye shook his head. If he were to be honest, he didn’t really like this method of fighting. Even though he hadn’t used his two greatest trump cards in the battle with Ku Moye just now, he hadn’t tried to probe Ku Moye. He’d immediately brought his physical strength to the brink and launched a flurry of attacks. So, that was why his battle with Ku Moye didn’t even take an hour.

Yet now, Yan Lingxue and Ku Yuan would probably be fighting for hours!

Yang Ye shook his head, sat down cross-legged, and then started to use Primordial Violet Energy to recover his strength. He’d exhausted too much of his physical strength during the battle with Ku Moye, and he felt quite exhausted. He had to recover as soon as possible because he had another difficult battle ahead of him!

If he could use his sword, then regardless of whether it was Ku Yuan or Yan Lingxue, both of them would only take a swing of his sword to deal with. Unfortunately, he couldn’t use his sword right now!

Around two hours later, Yan Lingxue and Ku Yuan’s battle was growing more and more intense. Obviously, they were about to get serious.

Yang Ye opened his eyes and looked towards the ring. After observing for a while, he noticed that Yan Lingxue was really quite exceptional. Yan Lingxue’s movements weren’t very swift, but they were very strange. She seemed indistinct like a phantom. Suddenly appearing at one place before appearing at another place, causing Ku Yuan to be unable to strike a clean blow on her.

As for her attacks, they weren’t ordinary as well. She didn’t focus on strength but vital points. Practically every one of her attacks struck Ku Yuan’s vital points, striking terror in Ku Yuan’s heart throughout the battle. Because just a single hit from her would cripple him even if he could avoid death!

After watching for a long time, Yang Ye shook his head and said, “Ku Yuan has lost!”

Man Shi was puzzled, “Why? Look, Ku Yuan is very strong, and Yan Lingxue is constantly avoiding him.”

Yang Ye replied, “It seems like Ku Yuan has the upper hand, but Ku Yuan is actually in an extremely dangerous situation, and the slightest mistake will make him suffer a lethal blow from her. She’s extraordinary. She knows how to use her advantages to make up for her weaknesses, and she knows how to feign weakness to lure her opponent in. That… that’s a trick that humans frequently use!”

“Humans?” Man Shi was stunned and said, “I wouldn’t have noticed if you didn’t point it out. But as soon as you have, I noticed that you’re quite like a human as well!”

Yang Ye’s eyelids twitched, “What do you mean?”

Man Shi explained, “Because you fight like Yan Lingxue sometimes. You too are fond of locating your opponent’s weakness. However, you’re definitely not a human because how could a human possibly possess such a powerful physical body?”

Yang Ye smiled and remained silent.

Meanwhile, the battle in the ring was growing more and more intense. Ku Yuan was clearly not holding back anymore. Every punch he swung was filled with power, and they were even much stronger than Yang Ye’s punches when he utilized the Brink Laws. At this moment, the space throughout the ring was rippling violently before the force contained in Ku Yuan’s punches!

However, Yan Lingxue was like a butterfly weaving through a field of flowers. She dodged every single punch of his and even frequently launched lethal strikes in his direction.

So, it was Ku Yuan who seemed to be in dire straits instead!

Yang Ye remained silent. Absolute strength could destroy everything before it, but if one focused too much on strength and neglected technique, then someone with technique may be able to overcome one’s strength. Just like this very moment, Yan Lingxue’s technique was overcoming Ku Yuan’s strength.

Regardless of whether it was strength, technique, or speed, one had to focus on all of them. Unless one could attain the extremes of one of those three aspects. For example, if one could shatter the space here with a single punch, then speed and technique would obviously be worthless before such absolute strength. However, if one couldn’t accomplish that, then only misery awaited!

Around 15 minutes later.

Yan Lingxue struck Ku Yuan’s chest and blasted him away. Meanwhile, she pressed forward and launched a flurry of attacks against him.

Bang!

In the end, Ku Yuan’s figure was blasted away and crashed into the ground. Yan Lingxue appeared in front of him before he could even stand up, and then her hand was pressed against his forehead.

Ku Yuan had lost!

Yan Lingxue withdrew her hand and said, “You focused too much on strength and neglected technique. If you fight a human sword cultivator of legend, the type that can locate the flaws and weaknesses in their opponent’s moves, then you’ll die before you even know it.”

“Locate the flaws and weaknesses?” Ku Yuan spoke solemnly, “Are you doing that?”

Yan Lingxue shook her head, “No, but I’m learning how to do that!”

Ku Yuan remained silent for a long time, and then he said, “I understand now! Congratulations!”

Meanwhile, Gu Mo appeared in the ring and declared, “The Blue Bird Clan’s Yan Lingxue is victorious.”

Countless demon beasts cheered in the crowd below, and the demon beasts from the Blue Bird Clan cheered the loudest. Their cheers shot up into the clouds.

Gu Mo nodded slightly and said, “Rest. The final battle will begin in four hours!”

Yan Lingxue nodded slightly, and then she left the ring.

Man Shi, who was by Yang Ye’s side said, “Xiao Yang, she’s formidable. Are you confident?”

Yang Ye glanced at him and replied, “I think I am!”

Man Shi was at a loss for words. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Time passed very quickly. In the blink of an eye, four hours had passed, and Yang Ye and Yan Lingxue were in the ring.

Gu Mo glanced at them and said, ‘Even though it’s hard to hold back in such a battle and accidents happen, both of you are geniuses of our demon race. I hope that you stop appropriately!”

He especially shot a glance at Yang Ye while he spoke. Yang Ye was very mysterious, and he couldn’t see through Yang Ye at all. Moreover, the Demon God thought so highly of Yang Ye. So, he thought more favorably of Yang Ye.

Yang Ye nodded. It was just a competition, so he would naturally not strike to kill. He wasn’t a madman. Of course, the precondition was that Yan Lingxue didn’t try to kill him.

His principle had always been to treat others how they treated him!

Yan Lingxue flipped her palm, and a sword appeared in her grasp, “Let’s fight!”

Yang Ye was stunned, “You’re going to use a weapon?”

She replied, “You can use one too!”

Yang Ye shook his head, “I don’t have one!”

Yan Lingxue suddenly waved her right hand, and a sword appeared before Yang Ye, “Now you do!”

Yang Ye gazed at the sword before him and was stunned for a while, and then he grabbed its hilt and said, “Er… Er… I feel bad…”
