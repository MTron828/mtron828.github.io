Chapter 674 – Divine Yin Flame!

“You’re truly mysterious!” Qin Bufan’s voice was serious this time, and it even carried traces of fear.

“Want to head to the Hallowed Grounds and have fun some time?” Yang Ye spoke abruptly. He was very clearly aware that the defiant profounders were about to emerge from the seal, and he couldn’t delay his trip to the Hallowed Grounds at all. If it was before this, he would naturally not travel there before attaining the Monarch Realm and give his life away. Yet now, he had the Stone of Suppression, so he could resist even a Half-Saint. At the very least, he could escape a Half-Saint. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

He’d personally witnessed Qin Bufan’s strength, and he knew that even a Half-Saint couldn’t harm Qin Bufan. So, if Qin Bufan joined him, then he would have someone to split away the forces of the Hallowed Grounds.

“You intend to go to the Hallowed Grounds?” Qin Bufan’s voice carried a trace of astonishment as he said, “Do you know why I came here? It’s because I wasn’t able to survive there, and I had no other choice. You’re just at the Exalt Realm. Even if you have the Stone of Suppression, do you think that you can go against so many Monarch Realm and Half-Saint Realm experts?”

Yang Ye spoke abruptly, “Do you think the Hallowed Grounds will let you go?”

Qin Bufan shook his head and said, “They’ll never let a single defiant profounder grow. Because they would pay an extremely heavy price if we’re allowed to regain our strength!”

Yang Ye said, “Exactly. They won’t let you go no matter what. In other words, they’ll continue dispatching experts to kill you. Even if they don’t do it now, they’ll definitely do it in the future. Since there’s irreconcilable enmity, then why should we always assume a passive position and can’t take the initiative instead?”

Qin Bufan replied, “You’ve never been to the Hallowed Grounds, so you don’t know how terrifying it is. If I hadn’t taken them by surprise that day, it would have been utterly impossible for me to escape. You know, the consciousnesses of at least a few dozen Half-Saints were pursuing me when I just left the Hallowed Grounds! I wouldn’t have been able to escape at all if it weren’t for the fact that I had some special techniques!”

A few dozen Half-Saints! Yang Ye’s expression became solemn. A short while passed before he laughed coldly and said, “So what? We aren’t going there to fight them in one on one battles.”

“You intend to play dirty?” asked Qin Bufan.

Yang Ye said, “It doesn’t matter. All that matters is that we can kill the members of the Hallowed Grounds, right?”

Qin Bufan remained silent for a short while, and then he said, “You really intend to go there?”

“Do I look like I’m joking?” said Yang Ye.

“Alright, then count me in! When are you leaving?”

Yang Ye pondered deeply for a moment and said, “A month from now!”

“Alright, I’ll come see you when the time comes!” Qin Bufan was about to leave once he finished speaking, but he suddenly continued, “Do you know that you’re colluding with defiant profounders by doing this?”

“Would the Hallowed Grounds let me go if I didn’t?” Yang Ye spoke indifferently.

Qin Bufan was slightly stunned, and then he smiled, “Interesting, truly interesting! You’re the first person that I feel is agreeable since I’ve arrived in this world. HAHAHA!” His laughter resounded as his figure vanished from the spot.

“Get me a quiet place!” Yang Ye turned around and gazed at Ding Shaoyao once Qin Bufan left.

She nodded in response.

Yang Ye slowly closed his eyes within Ding Shaoyao’s temporary dwellings, and he entered the Primordial Pagoda.

“What exactly is this place? What exactly is this place? You....” Yang Ye had just entered the pagoda when an extremely shocked and terrified shout resounded by his ears.

It was the black clothed man. At this moment, he was in quite a miserable state as he was nailed to the ground by a few dozen swords. He couldn’t move at all. Moreover, besides the intense pain he felt, his was covered in shock and bewilderment towards the world around him.

The reason he was shocked was that he’d seen the world, and it was exactly that which made him shocked. Because even if it was in the world that he was from, he’d never seen anyone possessing a world within the person’s body. No, it should be said that it was utterly impossible!

But the problem was that there was one before his eyes right now!

Yang Ye walked over to the black clothed man, and then grabbed his hair and dragged him to the Pavilion of Alchemy.

“You actually dare to treat me like this!? I....” He hadn’t even finished speaking when Yang Ye kicked his mouth and made him swallow everything he was about to say.

“I have no interest in arguing with you, so just stop!” Yang Ye glanced coldly at the black clothed man, and then he continued dragging the fellow to the furnace. Yang Ye gazed at the flames within the furnace and said, “I admit that I really can’t kill you, and I admit that I can’t do anything but bash you up.”

“Haha! Even Saint Realm experts can’t kill me, let alone you!” The black clothed man roared wildly with laughter, and his gaze was filled with defiance.

Yang Ye nodded, and then he pulled the black clothed man up and pointed at the flames within the furnace. He said, “This is the last way that I can think of. If you still can’t be killed, then I can only say that I truly admire how tenacious the lives of you, defiant profounders, are!!” He didn’t know what the flames within the furnace was, but he was very clearly aware that it was the most terrifying thing that he’d encountered until now. In any case, he didn’t dare to get close to it....

The black clothed man had intended to ridicule Yang Ye because nothing from this world could kill him. However, his expression instantly changed when he saw the flames within the furnace. There was astonishment, extreme astonishment within his eyes. After that, his body started to tremble violently.

Yang Ye’s brows knit together slightly because he felt that something was off. Even though the black clothed man was his enemy, the black clothed man had backbone, and he was absolutely not one who feared death. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have refrained from begging for mercy until now! However, the black clothed man actually revealed such a reaction right now....

What exactly are those flames?

“How could this be possible? How could it be here? How could this be possible? How...?” The black clothed man seemed as if he’d gone mad, and he was acting unusually.

Suddenly, a trace of extraordinary excitement and happiness appeared on his face, “The Divine Yin Flame! One of the four heavenly flames and said to be capable of burning anything. It’ll definitely be able to destroy the mark within me. 150,000 years! It has been 150,000 years! For the sake of finding a damnable pagoda, we traversed countless stellar regions and mysterious worlds, and we endured days and nights of pain. Now, I can finally be free! HAHAHA!”

The black clothed man suddenly leaped into the furnace as he spoke.

Bang!

Yang Ye watched with a solemn gaze as the black clothed man’s entire body exploded apart and transformed into nothingness.... After that, Yang Ye’s pupils constricted because a fine black worm had appeared within the flames after the black clothed man was incinerated. The black worm was merely the size of a thumb, but Yang Ye was extremely fearful of it. His 12th level Sword Intent surged out madly and formed a barrier before him.

After it appeared within the flames, the black worm emanated an extremely terrifying and evil aura, and it made Yang Ye’s entire body feel icy cold. To put it simply, he felt danger, extreme danger coming from it!

His intuition told him that he would definitely die if he came into contact with it!

The black worm wasn’t immediately incinerated within the flames, and it was wriggling around incessantly!

Roar!

Suddenly, it opened its mouth and roared furiously, causing the entire furnace to tremble violently. Yang Ye’s expression changed, and he moved a few more meters back. Fortunately, it didn’t escape the furnace, and it merely struggled for a while before it was incinerated into nothingness just like the black clothed man.

Yang Ye stood silently on the spot for a short while and confirmed that both the black worm and the black clothed man had vanished within the furnace before he dispersed his Sword Intent, and then he walked over and stopped 3m before the furnace.

A wisp of bewilderment and solemness filled Yang Ye’s eyes as he gazed at the flames within the furnace. He said, “What exactly is it? He said that they were looking for a pagoda for 150,000 years? A pagoda? Could they have been looking for my Primordial Pagoda? Could the defiant profounders be from the same world as Xiao Qi?”

Yang Ye’s expression gradually grew heavier and heavier. Because if they’d really come here in search of the Primordial Pagoda, then he might be in big trouble. What the black clothed man said had allowed him to roughly guess that the defiant profounders should have been ordered by someone, or it should be said that they were forced by someone to come here.

So, since the defiant profounders were already so terrifying, how terrifying would the one who was capable of ordering them around be?

He’d considered the possibility that they were sent here by the last owner of the Primordial Pagoda. However, after giving it some thought, he felt that it was impossible for them to have been sent by that old man. The feeling that the old man gave him was a feeling of righteousness, and it was a very comfortable feeling. But the worm from before gave him a completely different feeling.

In other words, it was very likely that the defiant profounders had been sent here by another force!

He possessed the Primordial Pagoda now, and that force wanted possession of the pagoda. In other words, he’d unknowingly made an enemy who was formidable beyond his wildest imagination....

He wouldn’t have such an enemy anymore if he handed the pagoda over. But the problem was that he couldn’t control the pagoda himself, so how could he hand it over? Besides that, he wouldn’t hand it over even if he could!

An enemy, and a formidable one at that was motivation for him to grow incessantly stronger!

Suddenly, Yang Ye frowned and flashed out of the Pavilion of Alchemy. An Nanjing was there.

“There was loud noise coming from here, so I came to have a look!” An Nanjing explained.

Yang Ye said, “I’m not keeping any secrets from you anymore, so you don’t have to explain anything.”

An Nanjing gazed silently at him.

“The internal injuries you suffered shouldn’t be a problem anymore, right?” asked Yang Ye.

An Nanjing replied, “I’ve almost recovered, but some latent problems still remain. So, I’ve been constantly treating it until now.”

“Will you be able to deal with it?” Yang Ye frowned.

She nodded, “I will, I just need some time.”

Yang Ye said, “Just stay here and recuperate for now. I’ll get someone to manage your clan for you. You don’t have to worry about it.”

An Nanjing fell silent for a moment, and then she gazed at Yang Ye and said, “I have a question for you. I can’t calm my mind until I get an answer!”
