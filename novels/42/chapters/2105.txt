Chapter 2106 – Sages Everywhere!

He was really surprised!

Yang Ye was really quite surprised. He hadn’t expected it to be resolved like this. Of course, it was all thanks to Snowy.

As he gazed at Snowy who was grinning at him, Yang Ye smiled. He knew that he’d underestimated this little fellow, and her strength was much greater than he’d ever imagined.

Actually, he wasn’t the only one, even Snowy herself didn’t know how strong she was.

She had no idea about what her strength was like, and she merely acted instinctively. If she could win, she would fight, and if she couldn’t, she would run. Most Sprites were the same too.

Yang Ye asked Snowy to return to the Primordial Pagoda, and then he glanced at the surroundings.

The space in the furnace was huge, and mysterious symbols covered its walls. These symbols weren’t glowing anymore, and they were extremely dim. Besides that, Yang Ye noticed sword intent in here! It was like a vortex of sword intent. The surroundings were filled with sharp and fierce sword intent. However, they were very calm, and they didn’t seem oppressive at all.

In the end, Yang Ye’s gaze descended onto a ball of flames not too far away from him.

At this moment, it was extremely weak.

Yang Ye thought for a moment and said, “Help me with something, and I’ll let you leave. I’ll give you back your freedom. Alright?”

Since it had reached such an extent, it definitely had a consciousness, so it could definitely understand him.

A short while later, it slowly floated over to Yang Ye and nodded.

Yang Ye glanced at it, and he knew that its consciousness hadn’t fully formed yet! Because it couldn’t speak with him, and that represented that it hadn’t fully formed a consciousness and gained intelligence comparable to a human. However, it did make sense because it was very, very difficult for beings like this to truly form their own consciousness.

Once he gained its agreement, the rest wasn’t that difficult.

Yang Ye withdrew the Sword Supreme, and as soon as he did that, the sword intent here started to become restless. In the end, all of it surged madly into the Sword Supreme. Yang Ye quickly withdrew the Divine Yin Flame, and then the Divine Yin Flame and the Soul Fire moved over and surrounded the Sword Supreme.

Yang Ye left the furnace because it wasn’t a place he could stay. Just the sword intent there was almost beyond his limits.

They were strands of sword intent that the Sword Supreme had left behind when it was born!

Once he left the furnace, Yang Ye saw the woman.

She glanced at him and remained silent.

Yang Ye glanced at her before withdrawing his gaze. He was naturally vigilant towards her. After all, she’d brought him here for no reason, so she definitely had her reasons.

Yang Ye restrained his thoughts and asked, “How long will it take?”

She replied indifferently, “I don’t know.”

Yang Ye nodded, and then he sat down cross-legged and gazed at the furnace. Presently, he was only worried that it would cause some sort of phenomenon here when it truly recovered, and that would bring a huge number of experts here.

If it really recovers, such experts wouldn’t be a problem to it, right?

However, if it fails, I’ll be finished.

Yang Ye closed his eyes slowly.

Time trickled by. The furnace remained extremely calm and there was no movement coming from within it.

Meanwhile, the woman hadn’t left. However, she didn’t say anything to Yang Ye either. Something else worth mentioning was that the small ball by her side had gone to Yang Ye a few times, and Yang Ye naturally knew that it wasn’t here for him, it was here for Snowy. Actually, Snowy really wanted to trick the small ball into going with them, and Yang Ye was certain that if Snowy really tried hard, she had an 80% chance to succeed.

However, Yang Ye didn’t let her do that.

There was a Sage sitting not too far away from him, and it was a very strong Sage.

Just like that, time trickled by, and five days passed.

At this moment, the furnace wasn’t calm anymore.

The huge furnace had started to tremble. YTY stood up, walked over to its side, and he could sense a wave of powerful energy coming from it.

Sword intent? Yang Ye frowned. A short while later, he started moving back and only stopped after he was around 300m away from it.

The energy within the furnace even made his heart palpitate a little.

Suddenly, the woman asked, “Why did she choose you?”

“Choose me?” Yang Ye gazed at her, “She didn’t choose me.”

The Sword Supreme had never been his. It had chosen Snowy and the Primordial Pagoda. Of course, others didn’t know that, and they thought it had chosen him.

The woman frowned when she heard Yang Ye, but she didn’t say anything.

Just like that, three more days passed.

At this moment, there were many cracks around the furnace, and Yang Ye had moved another 300m back. Moreover, he didn’t let Snowy get close to it either. At this moment, the furnace felt extremely dangerous to him.

Another day passed by!

Now, the cracks had grown even larger, and sword energy and flames were surging out of it from time to time.

Yang Ye couldn’t help but glance at the woman. She’d been staring at the furnace for days, and he wondered what she wanted?

Did she want to take the sword?

That was probably impossible. If the Sword Spirit really awakened, then perhaps only those progenitors could take it.

Meanwhile, she gazed at Yang Ye, “You should think about what you’re going to do later!”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “What do you mean?”

Suddenly, a sword howl resounded from within the furnace. It shot through space, and it spread through countless worlds.

At this moment, countless worlds throughout the large universe heard it.

Yang Ye’s expression was quite unsightly.

Now that the Sword Supreme had done that, everyone would know his location.

If a single sword howl could resound through countless worlds, it was obvious that only the Sword Supreme was capable of that, and who had the Sword Supreme now? So, it was obvious where Yang Ye was.

In an instant, countless experts throughout the large universe were alarmed!

Yang Ye was trying to awaken the spirit of the Sword Supreme!

As soon they received news about this, none of the experts in the large universe could sit still.

While Yang Ye was a threat to all the races now, he wasn’t a very huge one. But if Yang Ye awakened the Sword Supreme’s spirit, then Yang Ye wouldn’t just be a huge threat to them.

After all, how terrifying was Emperor Xuanyuan when he had it in his grasp?

Yang Ye couldn’t be allowed to succeed!

All the races instantly reached a consensus. So, countless experts pursued the source of the sword howl.

The Sword Ruins.

At this moment, Yang Ye’s expression was absolutely unsightly. If the Sword Supreme had awoken, then it wouldn’t be a big deal, but the problem was that it had released that sword howl before awakening. So, wasn’t it like digging his grave for him?

At this moment, Yang Ye felt like running.

“You want to leave?” The woman spoke abruptly, “I’m afraid it’s too late.”

As soon as she finished speaking, a middle aged man appeared not too far from Yang Ye’s left. Yang Ye recognized the middle aged man, it was the Sovereign of Sky!

The Sword Ruins was in the Sky Dimension, so the Sovereign of Sky was the first to get here.

He glanced at Yang Ye, and then gazed at the furnace. A solemn expression could be seen in his eyes.

Once the Sovereign of Sky arrived, more and more came after him. All of them were Sages. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

At this moment, all the races had practically sent all their elites here. Yang Ye wasn’t their only goal. After all, Yang Ye wasn’t that amazing to warrant so many elites. They’d sent all their elites because of the Sword Supreme!

The Sword Supreme before it awakened was useless to them, because it couldn’t do much.

However, once its spirit awoke, it wouldn’t be useless anymore. Anyone who obtained it could become the leader in the alliance of all the races. Even though they’d joined forces, it didn’t represent that they were selfless.

More and more experts were arriving. Some were experts from the other races, some were independent cultivators. No matter what, no one was paying much attention to Yang Ye right now.

“Brother Yang!” Suddenly, Yang Ye heard a familiar voice. He looked over towards the group from the human race, and he saw a man. He recognized the man because it was Qin Chuan whom he’d gotten to know in the Dead Dimension!

He’d gotten to know a group of people in the Dead Dimension, like the barbaric race’s A’Man, the devil race’s Mad Saber, the sky race’s Yu Jing, and the human race’s Qin Chuan. All of them were his friends. However, he rarely contacted them because anyone he contacted may fall into great trouble because of him.

Meanwhile, Qin Chuan walked over to Yang Ye and smiled, “They said you’re awakening the sword’s spirit, so I came with my ancestor. I didn’t expect you to really be here.”

Yang Ye smiled and said, “Do you realize that doing this may cause a lot of trouble for your clan?”

Qin Chuan glanced at the surroundings, and then he pushed a rock into Yang Ye’s hands, “A Spatial Stone. My ancestor gave it to me as a way to protect myself. You’ll be teleported randomly once you use it, and even a Sage can’t stop it. Once you use it, then coupled with your own Sword Domain, Spatial Laws, and Laws of Darkness, you’ll have a very good chance to escape.

Yang Ye glanced at the rock, and his heart felt warm. But he chuckled, “It won’t work.”

“Just try!” Qin Chuan looked Yang Ye in the eyes, “I have no other way to help you. If we’re facing any other ordinary person, we can still fight together, yet now, this area is covered in Sages. So, I can only help you run.”

“Run?” Suddenly, a voice came from afar, “I’m afraid you won’t have the chance. Everyone, I’m sure you’re aware that Yang Ye is quite close to the Sword Supreme’s spirit. If we don’t kill him first, then if it awakens and chooses Yang Ye, then I’m afraid all of you’ll have a really good time, huh?”

Everyone gazed at Yang Ye when they heard this.
