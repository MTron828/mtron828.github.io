Chapter 2327 – Death!

Everywhere Yang Ye’s saber passed, only corpses remained throughout the city!

Blood converged incessantly toward Yang Ye’s saber. At this point, the bloody aura Invincible emanated was simply impossible to describe with words. Moreover, its might was ceaselessly growing as more and more blood converged into it!

“He was from the large universe!” Suddenly, Shiyuan Xing howled with fury, and his voice was trembling.

In Initial City.

Bang!

Yang Ye suddenly stopped. He stabbed his saber in the ground, and it cracked open.

After that, he looked up at Shiyuan Xing, “Go on!”

Shiyuan Xing stared at Yang Ye, “He seemed to recognize her, and that was why he’d rescued her. My clan investigated him, and we confirmed that he really is from the large universe!”

Yang Ye closed his eyes slowly, “I think I know who it was!”

“So, can we let the matter rest now?” The Initial Emperor spoke abruptly.

Yang Ye gazed at the Initial Emperor, “What do you think?”

Initial Emperor walked over to Yang Ye, “This is just a strand of my will, so I can’t do anything to you with it. However, I think matters between men shouldn’t extend to the family. Don’t you think so too?”

Yang Ye didn’t say a word in response, and he just gazed at Shiyuan Xing, “Shall I, or will you do it yourself?”

Initial Emperor’s eyes narrowed slightly while he slowly clenched his fists. Suddenly, Shiyuan Xing chuckled, “Yang Ye, you don’t have to do it. My clan lost this battle, and I lost. We accept this defeat, and so do I. However, I still want to experience your strength before I die. Let me see how strong the number one genius of the large universe is!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Shiyuan Xing’s body started to burn!

Soul Ignition!

As his soul burned, his aura grew increasingly stronger. In the end, his aura was on par with a True World Realm expert. A moment later, he roared with laughter and transformed into a ball of flames that surged at Yang Ye.

Everywhere he passed, space was burned into nothingness!

Yang Ye’s expression remained unchanged as a black sword appeared in his grasp, a sword condensed from vengeful spirits!

Yang Ye closed his eyes slightly. When Shiyuan Xing arrived just 3m away from him, Yang Ye suddenly opened his eyes, and then he swung his sword with both hands!

The Sword Domain!

The ball of flames was immediately forced to a stop in front of Yang Ye. At the same time, it gradually dimmed down, and then vanished into nothingness! DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Yang Ye lowered his sword and walked off slowly with Invincible.

All the survivors in the city heaved sighs of relief when they witnessed this.

Meanwhile, the Initial Emperor suddenly said, “Yang Ye, I guarantee that when we meet again, I will only act against you and not against the people around you. Consider it my repayment for the mercy you’ve shown here today!”

Yang Ye didn’t reply and just vanished into the distance.

From this day onward, the Shiyuan Clan had suffered severe losses, and it slowly vanished from history. Besides Ling Xu who’d gone to the large universe, the Shiyuan Clan had practically lost all its True Dao Realm experts to Yang Ye.

So, it would take thousands of years for it to return to its peak!

…

Outside Initial City, Yang Ye sat down cross-legged, and two Eternal Crystals were in his grasp.

His strongest attack was obviously the Sword Domain.

Presently, he was able to execute it twice in an instant, and even True World Realm experts couldn’t resist that attack. However, it exhausted too much of his strength. Luckily, his body was at the True Dao Realm, so he could endure its might.

The only problem was profound energy!

The Primordial Pagoda!

Yang Ye thought of the Primordial Pagoda!

Suddenly, a brilliant ray of sword energy shot over from afar. Yang Ye looked up, and then a tiny white figure appeared before him. It was Snowy!

As soon as she saw Yang Ye, Snowy immediately started crying, and then she flew over to him and wrapped her paws around his neck. In just a short while, Yang Ye was covered in the spirit energy Snowy had cried out!

Snowy!

Yang Ye’s figure stiffened, and then he slowly hugged her.

Snowy!

She was his Snowy!

It didn’t take long for Sword Scroll, Wang Erya, and the small Primal Demon to appear before Yang Ye. Sword Scroll gazed at Yang Ye and sized him up incessantly. Meanwhile, Wang Erya and the Primal Demon were ceaselessly sizing up Snowy!

They were curious!

Wang Erya’s eyes were filled with curiosity!

A long, long time passed before Snowy finally returned to normal. She wiped off the tears on the corners of her eyes, and then waved her paw. A golden pagoda appeared in front of Yang Ye.

The Primordial Pagoda!

Since Yang Ye left, Snowy had hidden the Primordial Pagoda. Because it was Yang Ye’s, so no one could take it. Now, practically no one dared to offend Snowy. Especially after Yang Ye vanished, only Zi’er, Little Sky, and Su Qingshi were able to make her obey them. Moreover, during this period that Yang Ye had been away, Snowy’s temper had been quite hot, and she frequently attacked others with her axe!

A wisp of complicated emotions flashed through Yang Ye’s eyes as he gazed at the Primordial Pagoda. He rubbed Snowy’s little head and gazed at Sword Scroll, “What about them?”

She replied softly, “At the Sword Ruins!”

Yang Ye nodded, “Thanks.”

Sword Scroll glanced at Yang Ye, “Are you heading back now?”

Head back?

Yang Ye shook his head slightly, “I have a lot of people to get even with!”

Sword Scroll spoke solemnly, “You don’t plan to let it rest?”

“Let it rest?” Yang Ye chuckled, but his smile was slightly cold, “Sword Scroll, do you know what would happen to Snowy, Qingshi, and the others if I were killed? If Yang Ye hadn’t been rescued, what would have happened to her? Forget all of that. The patriarchs and experts of the six clans hunted me down like madmen. Should I just forget that?”

He looked up at the distant sky, “Just a little while ago, experts of the Immortal Estate arrived, and the patriarchs of the five clans immediately stepped forward from the shadows. Because they felt that two True World Realm experts and them would definitely be able to kill me. Now, they’ve fled because they don’t have the strength to kill me. But trust me, so long as they are given the chance, they will show no mercy to me!”

Sword Scroll fell silent.

If she were being honest, if those clans had the chance to kill him, they would absolutely not show mercy. But if Yang Ye didn’t attack now and spared them, would they be grateful? No!

So long as they had an opportunity to annihilate Yang Ye in the future, they would definitely grab it.

Yang Ye sent the Primordial Pagoda into his body. In an instant, the Primordial Violet Energy within him surged. At this moment, he didn’t have to worry about Primordial Violet Energy anymore.

Yang Ye glanced at Snowy and smiled, “Come, let’s go seek justice!”

Snowy hurriedly nodded.

Yang Ye’s figure transformed into a ray of light that vanished into the sky while Wang Erya, the Primal Demon, and Sword Scroll followed by his side.

Wang Erya walked over to Snowy. She was just about to stretch out her hand and touch Snowy, but the latter raised her paw to refuse it!

Wang Erya wasn’t infuriated but delighted by this instead. She chuckled, “Such a cute little fellow. I’m Erya, what about you?”

Yang Ye helped Snowy answer her, “She’s Snowy!”

Snowy nodded to indicate that Yang Ye was right!

Meanwhile, the Primal Demon suddenly walked over to Snowy and pointed at itself, “Ox… Ox…”

“Oxxy!” Wang Erya suddenly hit its head, “You’re Oxxy from now on!”

The Primal Demon was speechless.

Just like that, the Primal Demon had a new name, Oxxy.

Sword Scroll glanced at Wang Erya and Oxxy, and no one knew what she was thinking.

Meanwhile, Yang Ye’s voice resounded in her mind, “Can you discern their origins?”

Sword Scroll fell silent for a moment, and then she said, “Oxxy should be a descendant of the Heavenshaker Ox from the Primal Era. As for Erya… She isn’t human!”

Yang Ye asked, “Then what is she?”

Sword Scroll shook her head slightly, “I can’t discern or sense it.”

Yang Ye fell silent.

Sword Scroll suddenly asked, “Are you afraid she’ll harm Snowy?”

Yang Ye didn’t answer her.

Sword Scroll spoke solemnly, “You don’t have to worry about that. They won’t harm Snowy. Or to be a little blunt, even if you die, Snowy will be completely fine.”

Yang Ye glanced at Sword Scroll, and then he gazed at Snowy. At this moment, Snowy was sizing up Oxxy and frequently flying over to its head before knocking its horns. However, Oxxy didn’t resist at all!

Yang Ye withdrew his gaze and looked toward the distance. A boundless mountain range was before him, and there was an ancient city within it. The city was surrounded by mountains.

The Beichuan Clan!

It was the Beichuan Clan’s main city.

Yang Ye’s group hadn’t even approached the city when a huge barrier of light suddenly appeared in the sky and enveloped the entire city.

Bam!

Yang Ye led the others to the city’s entrance, and then he gazed at the barrier before slamming his saber against it.

Hiss!

A blood red ray of saber energy flashed and instantly struck the barrier of light.

Boom!

The entire barrier exploded apart!

Meanwhile, a middle aged man appeared on the city walls.

It was the Beichuan Clan’s patriarch, Beichuan Tian!

Countless members of the Beichuan Clan looked out of the city with horror. They knew what had happened in Initial City, and Yang Ye was at the Beichuan Clan now.

Yang Ye walked slowly toward the city with his saber in hand, and sparks sprayed as he dragged it along the ground.

Beichuan Tian glanced at his people in the city, and then he turned around and gazed at Yang Ye. An instant later, Yang Ye suddenly stopped.

Yang Ye glanced at Beichuan Tian, and then he raised his saber onto his shoulder and led the others into the sky.

On the city walls, Beichuan Tian’s figure gradually turned increasingly ethereal…

“Patriarch!” Countless people howled with sorrow from within the city.
