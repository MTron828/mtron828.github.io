Chapter 2282 – Kill First!

Countless swords circled incessantly outside Sky Sword Peak. At the same time, numerous powerful auras surged toward the mountain from throughout the city.

Yang Ye’s face was emotionless as he stood before the woman in a red dress, and no one knew what he was thinking.

It didn’t take long for an old man to appear before them.

It was the City Governor of Sword Sky City, Fan Tianyu.

Fan Tianyu gazed at the woman in a red dress, “He may be an extraordinary genius in the Sword Dao, but he possesses a few divine treasures, and those powers are determined to obtain them. Staying with him won’t end well for you.”

She nodded slightly, “I understand. You want me to stay, right?”

Fan Tianyu nodded, “You can name your conditions!”

She pointed at Yang Ye, “If someone in the younger generation of Sword Sky City can defeat him, then I’ll stay.”

Fan Tianyu’s expression became quite unsightly.

Defeat Yang Ye?

Not to mention the younger generation, even some old geezers in the True Dao Realm may not be able to defeat Yang Ye.

“I’ll do it!” Meanwhile, the woman in a green dress stepped forward.

Fan Tianyu shook his head and was about to say something when she vanished on the spot. The sight of this caused Fan Tianyu’s expression to change drastically, “Please show mercy!”

Bang!

As soon as he said that, a figure was blasted away.

It was the woman.

The surroundings fell silent at the sight of this. The middle aged man and beautiful woman had disbelief in their eyes. Just one attack. Their daughter was an extraordinary genius too, but she hadn’t even been able to resist one attack from Yang Ye!

Fan Tianyu glanced at the woman, and he heaved a sigh of relief when he noticed that she was still alive. After that, he gazed at Yang Ye. He was beyond shocked by Yang Ye’s attack too.

Yang Ye’s strength was much stronger than it had been.

The woman’s eyes were filled with disbelief too, “I-Impossible! H-How could you possibly…”

She was about to attack once she finished speaking, but the middle aged man and beautiful woman stopped her. However, she was still cursing and shouting.

Suddenly, Yang Ye walked slowly in her direction. Fan Tianyu and the others’ eyes narrowed slightly at the sight of this, but Yang Ye ignored them all. It didn’t take long for him to arrive before the woman and her parents. The middle aged man and beautiful woman stared at Yang Ye, and they would attack if he made the slightest movement.

Yang Ye looked the woman in the eyes and said, “Do you know why you lost?”

She stared at Yang Ye in silence.

Yang Ye chuckled, “Because I had a good father. He wasn’t like your father and mother, he didn’t protect me completely like you.” He gazed at the middle aged man and beautiful woman, “Do you know why your daughter can’t even resist a single attack from me while in the same realm of cultivation? Because I had a good father. He cared about me, but he refused to protect me at all times. He taught me that I have to rely on myself for everything.”

Yang Ye glanced at the surroundings and continued, “I have no ill intent toward Sword Sky City, and I don’t want to become enemies with it. The Limitless Sword Scroll has chosen me, and it’s an opportunity to me, an opportunity that Sword Sky City gave me. I will remember this debt. I can’t just leave like this, of course. So, how about I owe Sword Sky City a favor. If you need my help, then so long as I’m still alive, and it’s within my ability, I will definitely help you. Alright?”

A favor!

Everyone here was stunned. They hadn’t expected Yang Ye to say that. The expressions of the experts here gradually changed.

A favor!

They’d witnessed Yang Ye’s strength and talent. Coupled with the fact that he had the Limitless Sword Scroll now, Yang Ye would definitely become an extremely powerful expert if he survived. A favor from such an extraordinary expert held a lot of weight.

If they refused, it represented having to fight Yang Ye. Yang Ye may not be at the True Dao Realm, but his combat strength wasn’t any inferior to a True Dao Realm expert, and he had the woman in a red dress to help him too. If they fought, Sword Sky City would definitely pay a price. It would be alright if they managed to kill Yang Ye, but what if they failed?

When he thought up to this point, Fan Tianyu had his decision. He gazed at Yang Ye, “Congratulations, you’ll make a perfect pair.”

Yang Ye grinned and said, “Thank you.”

Yang Ye and the woman in a red dress turned around and left. No one stopped them.

Exalt Yun watched Yang Ye’s figure gradually vanish, and then he gazed at Fang Tianyu, “You think he’ll have a future after going to the Shiyuan Clan?”

Fan Tianyu shook his head slightly, “His strength is formidable, but the Shiyuan Clan is stronger. I’m afraid he may not make it back alive!”

Exalt Yun shook his head, “What a pity. If he could change his mind, then with his natural talent and karmic luck, he has a chance to overturn the Shiyuan Clan in the future. But if he goes now, he’ll probably die!”

Fan Tianyu looked into the distant sky, “I’m betting he won’t die!”

…

Yang Ye and the woman in a red dress left Sword Sky City and arrived high above in the clouds.

Suddenly, she said, “You’re very different from the Limitless Sword Master!”

Yang Ye gazed at her, “What do you mean?”

She spoke indifferently, “If it were him, he wouldn’t go. He would hide and cultivate like a madman, and then he would go to the Shiyuan Clan when he possessed sufficient strength.”

Yang Ye fell silent. She was indirectly persuading him not to go.

A short while passed before Yang Ye shook his head, “You don’t understand.”

She looked up at the sky, “You have a very small chance of winning.”

Yang Ye smiled, “I know.”

She gazed at him, “Then why are you still going?”

Yang Ye closed his eyes slowly, “I won’t abandon her, ever. If I can save her, it’s naturally good; if I can’t, I’ll die with her. Otherwise, she’ll be lonely!”

The woman took a deep and long glance at Yang Ye, “It’s just a woman. You can get any woman with your strength!”

Yang Ye chuckled, “You don’t understand!”

Actually, he was very well aware that if he went to the Shiyuan Clan now, he would die. However, could he not go? Of course he could. Just as she said, he just had to hide and cultivate, and then he would have a chance to overturn the Shiyuan Clan in the future. But if An Nanjing was already dead, what was the point of that?

Meanwhile, the woman in a red dress suddenly asked, “What if they kill her?”

Yang Ye glanced at her and replied, “I’ll make it so that not a single living thing remains in their clan.”

He looked up in the direction of the Shiyuan Clan, “I don’t have many loved ones left in my life. If even she is gone, then this world is pushing me into a corner. If I’m pushed into a corner, I’ll push the world into a corner too.”

She closed her eyes slowly, “The Limitless Sword Master’s talent was superior to yours, and he was stronger too. However, you are more extreme, and more terrifying.”

Yang Ye suddenly asked, “Is the Limitless Sword Master dead?”

She shook her head slightly, “No. But his fate is worse than death.”

Yang Ye gazed at her, “What do you mean?”

She replied indifferently, “When he attained the True Dao Realm, his strength became unprecedentedly strong, and he was called the number one sword in Eternal Border. The increase in his strength increased his confidence too, so he went to the Eternal River.”

Yang Ye frowned slightly, “He couldn’t get through it even with his strength?”

The woman glanced at Yang Ye, “It was far from enough. Unfortunately, he refused to listen.”

Yang Ye’s frown deepened. Even a True Dao Realm expert couldn’t get through it. So, it made Yang Ye wonder what the heck the Eternal River was!

She suddenly said, “Come with me to a place first.”

Yang Ye was puzzled, “Where?”

“The Sword Ruins!” She looked him in the eyes, “Don’t worry, it won’t take too long.”

Yang Ye asked, “Why?”

She replied, “So you can meet the strongest experts in the Sword Dao in this world.”

Yang Ye said, “The strongest in the Sword Dao? What are you trying to do?”

She replied, “I’m trying to make you even stronger!”

Yang Ye had quite a weird expression on his face as he gazed at her.

Meanwhile, she said, “Stop looking at me. I don’t have any ill intent. It’s just that I don’t have much time left, so I need you to grow even stronger. The stronger you are, my chances of returning… Our chances of getting to the Eternal Land will be greater.”

Yang Ye glanced at her and remained silent.

Just like that, they changed their direction and headed to the Sword Ruins.

Grow stronger!

No matter what her true objective was, Yang Ye could ignore all of it. All he cared about right now was An Nanjing, and his own strength. Since she was willing to help him improve his strength, why wouldn’t he agree to it?

Around an hour later, the woman suddenly stopped. Yang Ye was puzzled, but it didn’t take long for him to frown slightly. He looked over, and he saw space tremble violently there. A short while later, it cracked open to reveal an old man.

A True Dao Realm expert!

Yang Ye frowned as he wondered how the old man had found him. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

The old man walked over to Yang Ye, “I heard you’re going to the Shiyuan Clan?”

Yang Ye nodded, “Yes! Why?”

The old man nodded slightly, “It’s nothing. I just want you to leave a few things behind. You can leave if you’re willing to leave those three things behind.”

Yang Ye looked the old man in the eyes, “Just say that you want to take them from me!”

The old man looked at Yang Ye, “You’re right, that’s what I want.”

The woman suddenly asked, “Which power are you from?”

The old man glanced at her and was about to speak, but Yang Ye suddenly said, “Who cares where he’s from. I’ll kill him first before worrying about that.”

Yang Ye vanished on the spot.

The woman was stunned speechless.
