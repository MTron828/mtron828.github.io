Chapter 152 – Collaboration?

Su Qingshi left.

Right after that, a white glow flashed into appearance, and then Yin Xuan’er appeared before Yang Ye.

“That woman from before is the woman you love?” Yin Xuan’er glanced at the direction Su Qingshi left towards while a wisp of a charming smile suffused the corners of her mouth. She said, “So you like the icy cold type!”

Yang Ye glanced at her and said, “Do you need something?”

“Can I not come to talk to you just like that? Or you really hate me that much?” Yin Xuan’er was slightly angry while slight moisture had even appeared in her eyes. It seemed as if she’d been hurt by Yang Ye.

Yang Ye remained unmoved and said, “The only thing you fancy in my entire possession is that tiny vortex. You’re already staying within it, so you don’t have to act friendly to me like this. Because I don’t have anything that’s worthy of that.”

“Would you believe it if I said I took a fancy to you?” Yin Xuan’er’s eyes carried an embarrassed expression while her face was indescribably charming.

Yang Ye frowned and said, “There’s no need to execute such techniques against me. You ought to know that it’s useless against me!” Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“You’re really an insensitive block of wood!” Yin Xuan’er rolled her eyes at Yang Ye, restrained her smile, and then said seriously, “That little fellow of yours seems to be on the verge of advancement.”

“The little fellow is about to advance?” Yang Ye was stunned. He immersed his senses into his body and investigate the little fellow’s current state.

At this moment, the violet mink way lying lazily with its eyes closed in the profound energy pool within the tiny vortex. Its entire body emanated a thin layer of violet light while the pool of profound energy beneath the little guy was ceaselessly bubbling as if it was boiling.

Yang Ye opened his eyes and looked at her before he said, “The little fellow is going to advance into the King Rank?” His voice carried a wisp of excitement and happiness.

Even though the violet mink was merely a ninth rank Darkbeast and didn’t possess any offensive abilities, its other abilities could be described as terrifying. Not only could it conceal one’s aura, but the violet light barriers it created could also even resist the attacks of a Spirit Realm expert. Such abilities could really be described as terrifying.

So, if the little fellow was able to advance into a King Rank Darkbeast, then wouldn’t its abilities transform along with it? Yang Ye was filled with anticipation!

Yin Xuan’er suddenly asked. “Do you know why the little fellow refuses to tell you about its origins?”

“Why?” asked Yang Ye. He’d always been extremely puzzled by this. Since the beginning, the violet mink had concealed its origins from him. Yang Ye knew the little fellow definitely had a reason for doing so, but he was still extremely curious about it!

Yin Xuan’er smiled playfully and said, “I won’t tell you!”

Yang Ye’s face darkened, and he glared fiercely at Yin Xuan’er before he said, “I think you don’t know as well. Right, it seems to me like you’re very afraid of the little fellow’s bloodline pressure!”

“You don’t have to try and infuriate me!” Yin Xuan’er said, “As for its bloodline pressure, to tell you the truth, I’m indeed afraid of it. But I’m not afraid of it now because it’s only a ninth rank Darkbeast now. Moreover, I can very honestly tell you that those in the entire southern territory who are capable of being unafraid of its bloodline pressure can be counted with a single hand. It’s your fortune that it has chosen to follow you. Right, you have the tiny vortex, so it’s fortunate as well!”

“Miss Yin.” Yang Ye said with a serious expression, “What exactly is the little fellow’s origins? Moreover, why doesn’t the little fellow tell me about it? I know it wouldn’t harm me but I’m still very curious.”

Yin Xuan’er was silent for a short while before she sighed in the end and said, “Actually, I don’t have a very clear understanding of its origins as well. I’ve merely heard of its clan, and I never expected that they really exist. You’ve heard of the four divine beasts, right? I can only tell you that it isn’t inferior to the divine beasts. Moreover, even the Dragon Clan of legend doesn’t dare rashly offend the little fellow’s clan. Because a mature Spatial Mink is truly too, too terrifying!”

“Even the Dragon Clan of legend don’t dare offend it!” Yang Ye was visibly moved. He’d heard of the Dragon Clan. How terrifying were they? Supposedly, even Monarch Realm experts were unable to blast through their bodies, so it was obvious how terrifying they were. Moreover, this didn’t include the other abilities of dragons. Yet the little fellow’s clan was actually able to make even dragons fear offending it, so didn’t that mean the little fellow would be as terrifying as a dragon once it matured?

Yang Ye was slightly excited when he thought up to here. How could he not be? Once the little fellow grew up, wouldn’t it be equivalent to he, Yang Ye, possessing the help of an existence that was even more formidable than a Monarch Realm expert?

“As for why it refuses to tell you its origins, I presume it has its own reasons. In short, you just have to know that it has no ill intent to you.” Yin Xuan’er continued.

Yang Ye nodded and said with a smile, “You’re right, the little fellow doesn’t carry any ill intent towards me at any rate. As for its origins, I believe that it will definitely take the initiative to tell me once the time is right.”

“You’re really able to let things go, huh!” Yin Xuan’er smiled, and then said seriously, “There’s enmity between you and the Flower Palace?”

“What?”

“Perhaps we can collaborate!” Yin Xuan’er smiled and said, “In any case, I have enmity with the Flower Palace. After all, it was amongst the powers that annihilated my Shang Dynasty all those years ago! We have a common enemy, and since it’s a common enemy, then why don’t we collaborate against it?”

Yang Ye was slightly moved by this suggestion, but he shook his head in next to no time. He hadn’t forgotten that the Flower Palace wasn’t this woman’s only enemy, and it included the Grand Qin Empire and all the six great powers. If he joined forces with her, then it was very likely that he would be swept into the enmity between this woman and those powers.

He, Yang Ye, merely had enmity with the Flower Palace, and he only desired to annihilate it. He wasn’t interested in going against the other powers!

Yin Xuan’er’s beautiful brows knit together slightly when she saw Yang Ye shake his head, and she said, “I know that with your natural talent and potential, you ought to be able to go against the Flower Palace in the future. But that might be something that only comes to pass very, very long from now. If you join forces with me, then we’ll be able to shake the Flower Palace in a short period of time. I can tell you frankly that the 12 Gold Guards aren’t my only trump card!”

“What other trump cards do you have?” Yang Ye was slightly curious.

“I can’t tell you about the rest. I can only tell you that my Shang Dynasty’s Grand Preceptor, Shengong Mao, is still alive, and he was already a Monarch Realm expert a few hundred years ago!” said Yin Xuan’er.

Yang Ye gasped when he heard this, and then he said, “I know why you dare take revenge now. It turns out that you possess this super trump card. Indeed, it seems to be slightly possible for you to take revenge with the backing of a Monarch Realm expert!”

In the past, he thought Yin Xuan’er was courting death by seeking revenge. But now he felt that she did have a chance at success. A Monarch Realm expert and those 12 Gold Guards seemed to be sufficient to shake the Flower Palace. Moreover, this woman still had other trump cards. Obviously, the Shang Dynasty was a dynasty in the end, and it was impossible for it to lack loyal subjects.

Once this woman was able to seek out these loyal subjects.... Yang Ye didn’t dare continue on this train of thought. Just think about it, it such people really existed, then how could their strengths be weak? How could the strength of people who’d lived for hundreds of years be weak?

“What do you think? If we work together, we’re have a good chance of toppling the Flower Palace!” Yin Xuan’er continued.

Yang Ye took a deep breath and said, “Miss Yin, truthfully speaking, I was slightly moved by your words, but I’ll still be refusing.”

“Why?” Yin Xuan’er was puzzled.

“Firstly, your objective is to topple the Grand Qin Empire and the six great powers while my target is the Flower Palace alone. If I collaborate with you, then it’s very like that my enemies would grow from just the Flower Palace to include the Grand Qin Empire and all the six great powers. At that time, even if I was able to rescue my mother, my family would probably be unable to live peacefully for eternity. Moreover, I don’t trust you because my intuition tells me that you don’t want to collaborate with me just to go against the Flower Palace!” Yang Ye spoke frankly.

Yes, he felt that this woman intentions to collaborate with him didn’t stop at the Flower Palace. Even though it was only a guess of his, he believed this intuition of his.

Moreover, Yang Ye understood a principle. It was best to form a collaboration with the precondition that both sides had equal strengths. Otherwise, the weaker side would definitely suffer horrible consequences. At this moment, he was the weaker side when compared to Yin Xuan’er!

Yin Xuan’er remained silent for a short while before she said, “You’re very cautious, but I believe that you’ll definitely choose to collaborate with me in the future!”

As soon as she finished speaking, she didn’t say another word before entering Yang Ye’s tiny vortex.
