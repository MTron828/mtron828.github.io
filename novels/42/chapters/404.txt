Chapter 405 – The Hidden Dragon Pagoda

Yang Ye made a flicking motion with his finger, and the Nether Ghostflame flickered into appearance and burned the mark. However, the mark actually showed no signs of vanishing. On the contrary, it grew even brighter!

When he witnessed this scene and thought of what the enormous Divine Gold Dragon had said just now, Yang Ye’s expression grew even more solemn. He knew that it was absolutely something the Divine Gold Dragon had left behind before it perished. As for what exactly it was, he didn’t know, but in any case, it wasn’t anything good. It was even to the extent that the slightest mistake might cause him to offend the entire Divine Gold Dragon Clan in the demon territory!

Yang Ye shook his head and paid no further attention to this. Because worrying about it right now was entirely like making problems for himself. In any case, all he had to do was deal with everything that came at him!

Yang Ye raised his head to gaze towards the location of the Hidden Dragon Pagoda, and then he said lightly, “Today is the last day of the Hidden Dragon Rankings. I wonder how Leng Jun and those two other fellows have done!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Ye waved his right hand and transformed into a ray of light that vanished at the horizon.

The Hidden Dragon Pagoda.

At this moment, there was an enormous round arena in the valley, and a devil profounder was in an intense battle with a human profounder on the arena. On the other hand, the devil profounders and human profounders below the area were cheering madly for the two profounders on the arena, and their voices rumbled through the valley.

The experts from those sects in the central territory were at a side of the valley. Since they weren’t able to recruit the top 3 on the rankings into their sects, they’d locked their gazes onto the remaining human profounders that were participating in the rankings. These human profounders who were able to become eminent amidst thousands of others to seize a position in the top 10 of the Hidden Dragon Rankings wouldn’t just possess monstrous natural talent, they would even be able to bring Karmic Luck to the sects that recruited them. So, all of these experts naturally didn’t intend to miss such an opportunity to kill two birds with one stone!

Yang Ye was stunned when he arrived here and saw the two profounders who were on the arena because the human profounder there was none other than Zhang Liu!

At this moment, Zhang Liu was a Spirit Realm expert, and his opponent was at the Spirit Realm as well! Their strengths were equal on the surface but if one were to look carefully, then one would notice that Zhang Liu displayed faint signs of being suppressed by his opponent. Devil profounders had a greater advantage when compared to human profounders, and their physical strength and defense was one of the most obvious aspects.

Zhang Liu suffered a huge disadvantage in this battle because he was an assassin, so it was a disadvantage in and of itself to fight a head-on battle. Coupled with the formidable physical bodies that devil profounders possessed, Zhang Liu gradually showed signs of falling into a disadvantaged state as the battle progressed.

However, he relied on his agile movement technique to avoid any material harm from the devil profounder, but that was all he could manage!

Suddenly, Yang Ye seemed to have noticed something and swiftly turned to the side, and he saw that An Nanjing was suddenly standing by his side. Yang Ye’s eyelids twitched upon seeing her because he noticed that she was actually at the second rank of the Spirit Realm now! My god! How many days has it been? She has already advanced by another rank? Such natural talent....

A wisp of surprise flashed through An Nanjing’s eyes as she gazed at Yang Ye. She said, “I can sense that your strength has improved greatly. Not bad, not bad! Very good!”

“Hasn’t your strength improved greatly as well?” Yang Ye said, “You’ve already advanced by a rank in such a short period of a few days. Your natural talent truly makes others feel embarrassed of their inferiority!”

“When can we fight?” An Nanjing looked Yang Ye in the eye while an undisguised glow of excitement could be seen within them. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

The corners of Yang Ye’s mouth twitched. The woman is truly addicted to battle!

“We’ll have a chance!” said Yang Ye.

“But I’m already feeling quite impatient!” said An Nanjing.

Yang Ye was instantly troubled. Truthfully speaking, he wanted to fight the woman who stood by his side because it was truly difficult to find such an opponent. A battle with her would definitely surpass a few months of ordinary cultivation. However, the current situation caused him to be unable to fight her to his heart’s content.

An Nanjing suddenly said, “Your natural talent isn’t bad. It isn’t weaker to mine at all. However, you have too many chains holding you back, and if you can’t abandon them, then the gap between the two of us in the path of the Martial Dao will only grow wider and wider. Moreover, your natural talent in the Sword Dao will be buried by you as well!”

Yang Ye suddenly asked. “Marital God Jing, have you liked someone before?”

An Nanjing was stunned, and then she said, “Can liking someone make me stronger?”

Yang Ye was speechless.

“Since it can’t, then what’s the point of liking someone?” An Nanjing glanced at Yang Ye and said, “I, An Nanjing, naturally have attachments, but I won’t be chained by them. But you’ve been chained by too much of it. Attachments are your greatest flaw, and you’ll be eternally unable to become an expert while you’re chained by them!”

Yang Ye shook his head and said, “I admit that you really do make sense. However, every single person seeks something different. I don’t seek to be invincible throughout the world or to reign supreme over the continent. Even though it’s very likely that I have to be invincible throughout the world in order to achieve what I seek, but I really don’t seek to be invincible throughout the world. In my opinion, the safety of my family and having the people I care about by my side is the most important!”

An Nanjing suddenly asked. “Your motivation to improve your strength incessantly comes from your attachments?”

Yang Ye smiled and said, “It really was in the past. However, I’ve noticed a principle now. In this world where the strong are respected, only strength would allow one to possess the right to make decisions and maintain one’s dignity. If one doesn’t have strength, then not to mention protecting one’s family, even surviving would be a problem. So, it can be said that my current motivation to become stronger is to survive. Haha....”

An Nanjing glanced at Yang Ye and pondered deeply for a moment before she shook her head lightly, and then she gazed at the arena as she said, “That human profounder is about to win!”

“Oh? What do you mean?” Yang Ye was instantly interested in this.

“Even though he seems to be in a disadvantaged position, but he seems extremely steady, and he shows no sign of being forced into a state of disorder. Pay attention to his eyes, his eyes are extremely calm. Besides that, every single attack of his is very decisive, and he deals with his opponent’s attacks without delay. His footsteps are very steady as well. While he seems to be suppressed on the surface, it’s actually a mere tactic to show weakness to his opponent!” An Nanjing spoke indifferently.

A wisp of a solemn expression flashed through Yang Ye’s eyes when he heard this. Even though she doesn’t possess the Enlightened Sword Heart, her discerning ability isn’t any inferior to my Enlightened Sword Heart! No wonder her senses in combat are that formidable!Right at this moment, the devil profounder on the arena suddenly shouted. “Human! Die!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he took a sudden and huge stride forward as he shot explosively towards Zhang Liu who’d already been forced to the edge of the arena. His hands were spread upon into palms before they whistled through the air and slapped down forcefully at Zhang Liu.

A wisp of a ruthless and strange smile flashed through Zhang Liu’s face, and then he tapped his right leg on the ground and shouted. “Clone Illusion Technique!”

As soon as he spoke, Zhang Liu’s figure shook lightly before four figures who looked like Zhang Liu appeared on the arena. The devil profounder was slightly stunned by this, and it was exactly at this instant that a cold ray of light flashed through his neck. A wisp of disdain arose on the corners of the devil profounder’s mouth because this human profounder wasn’t able to break through his defenses at all yet was attacking again!

However, delight had curled onto the corners of Yang Ye’s mouth when he witnessed this scene, and he said, “He has won!” Only Yang Ye knew that Zhang Liu had changed his dagger at the last moment, and he’d changed it to the dagger which was crafted from the dragon bones. In other words, Zhang Liu was making a show of weakness earlier, and his true lethal move had only been executed at this moment!

The dagger swept past the devil profounder’s neck, and then the disdain on his face instantly froze there! After that, his head flew off under the astounded gazes of all the spectators!

All the human profounders were stunned before waves of cheers suddenly erupted. In the Ancient Battlefield, there was nothing more exciting and delighting to the human profounders than watching a fellow human kill a profounder from the devil, nether, or demon race!

Meanwhile, Qian Huan appeared on the arena. He glanced at the corpse of that devil profounder and nodded slightly before he said, “Since the top 30 have been decided, then I invite all the profounders in the top 30 to ascend the arena!”

Yang Ye and An Nanjing flashed, and they instantly appeared on the arena. Moreover, Mo Ke had appeared at the same time as well!

“The Martial God!”

“The Sword Emperor!”

The crowd seethed once more with excitement when they saw Yang Ye and An Nanjing. Both of them were undoubtedly supreme existences in the hearts of the younger generation of the human race throughout the continent. Because only the two of them could kill the profounders from the devil, nether, and demon race like they were slaughtering chickens!

Yang Ye disregarded the cheers of the crowd below the arena. At this moment, he was extremely excited because obtaining the Karmic Luck represented that Xiao Yuxi would be truly saved!
